A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the minimum sample size, $n$, required to estimate a population prevalence, $p$, with a specified margin of error, $m$, and confidence level, $1-\\alpha$.\n\n1.  **Properties of the Estimator**:\n    The random variable $X$, representing the number of seropositive individuals in a sample of size $n$, is stated to follow a binomial distribution, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Bin}(n, p)$. The estimator for the prevalence is $\\hat{p} = X/n$.\n\n    The expected value (mean) of the estimator $\\hat{p}$ is:\n    $$E[\\hat{p}] = E\\left[\\frac{X}{n}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n}E[X]$$\n    Given that the mean of a binomial random variable is $np$, we have:\n    $$E[\\hat{p}] = \\frac{1}{n}(np) = p$$\n    This demonstrates that $\\hat{p}$ is an unbiased estimator of $p$.\n\n    The variance of the estimator $\\hat{p}$ is:\n    $$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{X}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\mathrm{Var}(X)$$\n    Given that the variance of a binomial random variable is $np(1-p)$, we have:\n    $$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{1}{n^2}(np(1-p)) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$$\n    The standard deviation of the estimator, known as the standard error (SE), is the square root of the variance:\n    $$\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$\n\n2.  **Normal Approximation and Confidence Interval Construction**:\n    The problem specifies the use of a normal approximation, which is justified by the Central Limit Theorem for large sample sizes $n$. The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ can be approximated by a normal distribution:\n    $$\\hat{p} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right)$$\n    A two-sided confidence interval with a confidence level of $1-\\alpha$ for the true prevalence $p$ is constructed as:\n    $$\\text{CI} = \\text{estimator} \\pm (\\text{critical value}) \\times (\\text{standard error})$$\n    For a normal approximation, the critical value is obtained from the standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Let $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ be the critical value such that the area between $-z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ and $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ under the standard normal curve is $1-\\alpha$. The confidence interval is then given by:\n    $$\\text{CI} = \\hat{p} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{p})$$\n    Substituting the expression for the true standard error (as is appropriate for planning purposes where $p$ is assumed):\n    $$\\text{CI} = \\hat{p} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$\n\n3.  **Margin of Error and Sample Size Calculation**:\n    The margin of error, $m$, is defined as the half-width of the confidence interval. From the structure of the CI, we can identify the margin of error as:\n    $$m = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$\n    Our goal is to solve this equation for $n$. We proceed with algebraic manipulation. First, square both sides of the equation:\n    $$m^2 = \\left(z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\right)^2$$\n    $$m^2 = (z_{1-\\alpha/2})^2 \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$$\n    Next, we isolate $n$. Multiply both sides by $n$:\n    $$n \\cdot m^2 = (z_{1-\\alpha/2})^2 p(1-p)$$\n    Finally, divide both sides by $m^2$ to obtain the expression for $n$:\n    $$n = \\frac{(z_{1-\\alpha/2})^2 p(1-p)}{m^2}$$\n    This is the required closed-form expression for the minimum sample size $n$ as a real-valued function, expressed solely in terms of the true prevalence $p$, the desired margin of error $m$, and the confidence level $1-\\alpha$ (which determines the critical value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(z_{1-\\alpha/2})^{2} p(1-p)}{m^{2}}}$$", "id": "4980500"}, {"introduction": "While the Poisson distribution is a cornerstone for modeling count data, it assumes that the variance is equal to the mean, a condition often violated in practice where data exhibit overdispersion.

The model assumes that conditional on a latent rate $\\Lambda$, the count $Y$ follows a Poisson distribution, and the rate $\\Lambda$ itself follows a Gamma distribution.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Marginal Probability Mass Function (PMF) of $Y$**\n\nThe conditional distribution of the count $Y$ given the rate $\\Lambda = \\lambda$ is Poisson:\n$$P(Y=y \\mid \\Lambda=\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^y \\exp(-\\lambda)}{y!}, \\quad \\text{for } y \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$$\nThe rate $\\Lambda$ is assumed to follow a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $k$ and scale parameter $\\theta$, denoted as $\\Lambda \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k, \\theta)$. The probability density function (PDF) of $\\Lambda$ is:\n$$f_{\\Lambda}(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^k} \\lambda^{k-1} \\exp(-\\lambda/\\theta), \\quad \\text{for } \\lambda > 0$$\nThe marginal PMF of $Y$ is obtained by integrating the product of the conditional PMF of $Y$ and the PDF of $\\Lambda$ over all possible values of $\\lambda$:\n$$P(Y=y) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} P(Y=y \\mid \\Lambda=\\lambda) f_{\\Lambda}(\\lambda) \\,d\\lambda$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the Poisson PMF and Gamma PDF:\n$$P(Y=y) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^y \\exp(-\\lambda)}{y!} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^k} \\lambda^{k-1} \\exp(-\\lambda/\\theta) \\,d\\lambda$$\nWe can rearrange the terms to isolate the integral with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$P(Y=y) = \\frac{1}{y! \\Gamma(k) \\theta^k} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{y+k-1} \\exp\\left(-\\lambda\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)\\right) \\,d\\lambda$$\n$$P(Y=y) = \\frac{1}{y! \\Gamma(k) \\theta^k} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{(y+k)-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}}\\right) \\,d\\lambda$$\nThe integral is the kernel of a Gamma distribution. The value of this integral is known to be $\\Gamma(y+k) \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}\\right)^{y+k}$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$P(Y=y) = \\frac{1}{y! \\Gamma(k) \\theta^k} \\cdot \\Gamma(y+k) \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}\\right)^{y+k}$$\nThis expression can be simplified:\n$$P(Y=y) = \\frac{\\Gamma(y+k)}{y! \\Gamma(k)} \\frac{\\theta^{y+k}}{\\theta^k (1+\\theta)^{y+k}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(y+k)}{y! \\Gamma(k)} \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}\\right)^y \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}\\right)^k$$\nThis is the PMF of a Negative Binomial distribution, commonly expressed using the generalized binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{k!\\Gamma(n-k+1)}$. Specifically, since $\\binom{y+k-1}{y} = \\frac{\\Gamma(y+k)}{y!\\Gamma(k)}$, we have:\n$$P(Y=y) = \\binom{y+k-1}{y} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}\\right)^y$$\n\n2.  **Re-parameterization and Log-Likelihood**\n\nThe problem requires expressing the PMF in terms of parameters $(k, \\mu)$, where $\\mu = k\\theta$ is the mean of the Gamma distribution. We substitute $\\theta = \\mu/k$ into the PMF:\n$$1+\\theta = 1 + \\frac{\\mu}{k} = \\frac{k+\\mu}{k} \\implies \\frac{1}{1+\\theta} = \\frac{k}{k+\\mu}$$\n$$\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta} = \\frac{\\mu/k}{(k+\\mu)/k} = \\frac{\\mu}{k+\\mu}$$\nSubstituting these into the PMF gives:\n$$P(Y=y; k, \\mu) = \\frac{\\Gamma(y+k)}{y! \\Gamma(k)} \\left(\\frac{k}{k+\\mu}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{k+\\mu}\\right)^y$$\nFor independent observations $y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n$, the likelihood function is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$L(k, \\mu \\mid y_1, \\dots, y_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(Y=y_i; k, \\mu) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ \\frac{\\Gamma(y_i+k)}{y_i! \\Gamma(k)} \\left(\\frac{k}{k+\\mu}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{k+\\mu}\\right)^{y_i} \\right]$$\nThe log-likelihood, $\\ell(k, \\mu \\mid y_1, \\dots, y_n) = \\ln(L)$, is the sum of the logarithms of the individual probabilities:\n$$\\ell(k, \\mu \\mid y_1, \\dots, y_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ \\ln(\\Gamma(y_i+k)) - \\ln(y_i!) - \\ln(\\Gamma(k)) + k\\ln\\left(\\frac{k}{k+\\mu}\\right) + y_i\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{k+\\mu}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\ell(k, \\mu \\mid y_1, \\dots, y_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(\\Gamma(y_i+k)) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(y_i!) - n\\ln(\\Gamma(k)) + nk\\ln(k) - nk\\ln(k+\\mu) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\\right) (\\ln(\\mu) - \\ln(k+\\mu))$$\nThis is the log-likelihood as a function of $k$ and $\\mu$.\n\n3.  **Method of Moments (MoM) Estimation**\n\nTo find the MoM estimator for $k$, we first need the theoretical mean and variance of the marginal distribution of $Y$. We use the laws of total expectation and total variance.\nThe mean of $Y$ is:\n$$E[Y] = E[E[Y \\mid \\Lambda]] = E[\\Lambda]$$\nSince $\\Lambda \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k, \\theta)$ with mean $\\mu = k\\theta$, we have $E[Y] = \\mu$.\nThe variance of $Y$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = E[\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid \\Lambda)] + \\mathrm{Var}(E[Y \\mid \\Lambda])$$\nFor a Poisson distribution, $\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid \\Lambda) = \\Lambda$ and $E[Y \\mid \\Lambda] = \\Lambda$. Thus:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = E[\\Lambda] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\Lambda)$$\nThe variance of a $\\mathrm{Gamma}(k, \\theta)$ distribution is $k\\theta^2$. So:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = k\\theta + k\\theta^2$$\nWe express this in terms of $\\mu$ and $k$ by substituting $\\theta = \\mu/k$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = k\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{k}\\right) + k\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{k}\\right)^2 = \\mu + k\\frac{\\mu^2}{k^2} = \\mu + \\frac{\\mu^2}{k}$$\nThe method of moments equates these theoretical moments to the corresponding empirical moments. The empirical mean is $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$ and the empirical population variance is $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$.\nThe MoM equations are:\n1.  $\\hat{\\mu}_{MoM} = \\bar{y}$\n2.  $\\hat{\\sigma}^2_{MoM} = s^2 = \\hat{\\mu}_{MoM} + \\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_{MoM}^2}{\\hat{k}_{MoM}}$\n\nFrom the second equation, we solve for the MoM estimator of $k$, denoted $\\hat{k}_{MoM}$:\n$$s^2 = \\bar{y} + \\frac{\\bar{y}^2}{\\hat{k}_{MoM}} \\implies s^2 - \\bar{y} = \\frac{\\bar{y}^2}{\\hat{k}_{MoM}}$$\n$$\\hat{k}_{MoM} = \\frac{\\bar{y}^2}{s^2 - \\bar{y}}$$\nNote that for this estimator to be positive, the sample variance $s^2$ must be greater than the sample mean $\\bar{y}$, a condition known as overdispersion (relative to the Poisson model where variance equals mean).\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe provided data are the weekly counts for $n=12$ weeks:\n$$y = (4, 9, 7, 12, 3, 11, 0, 8, 14, 5, 6, 10)$$\nFirst, we compute the sample mean $\\bar{y}$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{12} y_i = 4+9+7+12+3+11+0+8+14+5+6+10 = 89$$\n$$\\bar{y} = \\frac{89}{12}$$\nNext, we compute the sample population variance $s^2$. We first find the sum of squares:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{12} y_i^2 = 16+81+49+144+9+121+0+64+196+25+36+100 = 841$$\n$$s^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 - \\bar{y}^2 = \\frac{841}{12} - \\left(\\frac{89}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{841 \\times 12 - 89^2}{144} = \\frac{10092 - 7921}{144} = \\frac{2171}{144}$$\nThe sample variance $s^2 \\approx 15.076$ is indeed greater than the sample mean $\\bar{y} \\approx 7.417$, so the data is overdispersed.\nNow we can compute the MoM estimate for $k$:\n$$\\hat{k}_{MoM} = \\frac{\\bar{y}^2}{s^2 - \\bar{y}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{89}{12}\\right)^2}{\\frac{2171}{144} - \\frac{89}{12}} = \\frac{\\frac{7921}{144}}{\\frac{2171 - (89 \\times 12)}{144}} = \\frac{7921}{2171 - 1068} = \\frac{7921}{1103}$$\n$$\\hat{k}_{MoM} \\approx 7.18132366...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the MoM estimate for the dispersion parameter $k$ is $7.181$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.181}$$", "id": "4980516"}, {"introduction": "Asymptotic approximations, like the normal approximation to the binomial or Poisson distribution, are powerful but have their limits.

It is a well-formulated problem in applied statistics. I will now proceed with the solution by evaluating each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to evaluate the breakdown of normal approximations for discrete distributions (Binomial, Poisson) when event probabilities are very low (or very high) or when observed counts are sparse. In these regimes, the distributions are highly skewed, violating the symmetry assumed by the normal distribution.\n\n**A. For $X\\sim \\mathrm{Bin}(n,p)$ with $p$ near $0$ or $1$, the normal approximation to the sampling distribution of the sample proportion fails when $n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})$ is small, as in $\\hat{p}=x_1/n_1=2/400$; one should use exact binomial tests and exact binomial confidence intervals obtained by inverting the binomial cumulative distribution function (e.g., Clopper–Pearson).**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The normal approximation to the binomial distribution is justified by the De Moivre-Laplace theorem, a special case of the CLT. A common rule of thumb for the adequacy of this approximation is that the expected number of successes, $np$, and the expected number of failures, $n(1-p)$, should both be sufficiently large (e.g., $\\geq 5$ or $\\geq 10$). When $p$ is close to $0$ or $1$, the binomial distribution is highly skewed unless $n$ is very large. In the given case, $\\hat{p}_1 = x_1/n_1 = 2/400 = 0.005$. The observed number of successes is $x_1=2$. The estimated expected number of successes is $n_1\\hat{p}_1 = 2$, which is below the common threshold of $5$. The quantity $n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})$ is the estimated variance of the count $X$, which is $400(0.005)(0.995) = 1.99$. This small value indicates a highly skewed sampling distribution, for which the symmetric normal approximation is poor. The proposed remedy is to use \"exact\" methods. The Clopper-Pearson interval is constructed by finding $p_L$ and $p_U$ such that $P(X \\ge x | p_U) = \\alpha/2$ and $P(X \\le x | p_L) = \\alpha/2$, which involves inverting the binomial CDF. This method is called \"exact\" because it uses the binomial distribution directly and guarantees a coverage probability of at least $1-\\alpha$ for all values of $p$. This statement accurately describes the failure mode and the standard, correct remedy.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. A continuity correction alone makes the normal approximation acceptable whenever $n\\hat{p}\\ge 5$ or $n(1-\\hat{p})\\ge 5$; therefore, the normal approximation is acceptable for the control cohort with $\\hat{p}=6/400$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This statement has two major flaws. First, the rule of thumb for the normal approximation is that $n\\hat{p}$ **and** $n(1-\\hat{p})$ must be sufficiently large, not \"$n\\hat{p} \\ge 5$ **or** $n(1-\\hat{p}) \\ge 5$\". The use of \"or\" is incorrect. As a counterexample, if $x=0$, then $\\hat{p}=0$, so $n\\hat{p}=0$. However, $n(1-\\hat{p})=n$, which for large $n$ would satisfy the \"or\" condition, but the normal approximation is grossly inaccurate when $x=0$. Second, for the control cohort, $n_0=400$ and $x_0=6$. Thus $\\hat{p}_0 = 6/400 = 0.015$. The number of successes is $n_0\\hat{p}_0 = 6$ and failures is $n_0(1-\\hat{p}_0) = 394$. While $6$ meets the threshold of $5$, it is still a small count, and the underlying distribution for the proportion is skewed. A continuity correction is an improvement, but it does not fully resolve the issue of skewness, and to claim the approximation becomes \"acceptable\" is a strong overstatement. More accurate methods (e.g., Wilson score, Agresti-Coull, or exact methods) are preferable. The primary error, however, is the \"or\" in the criterion.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For $Y\\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ with sparse counts, such as $k=1$ observed event and expected count $\\lambda$ near $0$, the normal approximation with mean $\\lambda$ and variance $\\lambda$ is unreliable; exact one-sample Poisson tests and confidence intervals should be obtained by inverting the Poisson cumulative distribution function.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The normal approximation to the Poisson distribution, $Y \\sim \\mathrm{N}(\\lambda, \\lambda)$, is valid for large $\\lambda$. For the infusion safety audit, we observe $k=1$ event. The maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter $\\lambda$ (expected events in the period) is $\\hat{\\lambda}=1$. A Poisson distribution with $\\lambda=1$ is highly skewed: $P(Y=0) \\approx 0.368$, $P(Y=1) \\approx 0.368$, $P(Y=2) \\approx 0.184$. This is far from the symmetric, bell-shaped normal curve. Thus, the normal approximation is indeed unreliable. The proposed remedy is the \"exact\" method, which, analogous to the binomial case, involves inverting the Poisson CDF to find the confidence limits $\\lambda_L$ and $\\lambda_U$. Specifically, for an observation $k$ and confidence level $1-\\alpha$, the interval is derived from the equations $P(Y \\ge k | \\lambda=\\lambda_L) = \\alpha/2$ and $P(Y \\le k | \\lambda=\\lambda_U) = \\alpha/2$. This is the standard, theoretically sound procedure for obtaining confidence intervals for a Poisson parameter when counts are small.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Replacing $\\hat{p}$ by an adjusted estimator $\\tilde{p}=\\dfrac{\\hat{p}+2/n}{1+4/n}$ ensures exact coverage when using normal-based binomial confidence intervals for all $n$ and $p$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The estimator $\\tilde{p}=\\dfrac{\\hat{p}+2/n}{1+4/n} = \\dfrac{x/n+2/n}{1+4/n} = \\dfrac{x+2}{n+4}$. A normal-based interval using this estimator is the Agresti-Coull interval. While this interval has been shown to have excellent performance, with average coverage probability very close to the nominal level, it does not provide \"exact\" coverage. The term \"exact coverage\" implies that for any given true $p$, the coverage probability is exactly $1-\\alpha$. No interval based on a continuous approximation (normal) for a discrete distribution (binomial) can achieve this. The coverage probability of any such interval fluctuates as a function of $p$. Even the Clopper-Pearson \"exact\" interval does not have exact coverage; it is conservative, meaning its coverage is guaranteed to be $\\ge 1-\\alpha$, but it is not exactly $1-\\alpha$. The claim that the Agresti-Coull interval provides \"exact coverage\" for \"all $n$ and $p$\" is false.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In a $2\\times 2$ table with rare events and fixed margins, Fisher’s exact test provides an exact test of equality of proportions without relying on asymptotic normal approximations; it is appropriate for comparing $x_1=2$ out of $n_1=400$ versus $x_0=6$ out of $n_0=400$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The comparison between the two cohorts can be represented in a $2\\times 2$ contingency table with counts for Sepsis/No Sepsis vs. Protocol/Control. The counts are $(x_1, n_1-x_1)$ and $(x_0, n_0-x_0)$, or $(2, 398)$ and $(6, 394)$. Fisher's exact test is designed for such tables. It computes the probability of observing the given table, and all other more extreme tables, conditional on the marginal totals (row totals $400, 400$; column totals $8, 792$). This probability is calculated using the hypergeometric distribution. The method is \"exact\" because it does not rely on any large-sample approximation, such as the chi-squared distribution, which is itself based on normal approximations. It is the gold standard for hypothesis testing in $2\\times 2$ tables, especially when event counts are small (as they are here: $2$ and $6$), making the chi-squared approximation less reliable. Therefore, this statement correctly identifies the appropriate exact method for this specific comparison.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**F. When $x=0$ events are observed in a binomial sample, the normal approximation fails because $\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})=0$, but switching to a normal approximation on the logit scale, $\\mathrm{logit}(\\hat{p})$, always produces exact coverage for the true $p$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The first part of the statement is correct. When $x=0$, $\\hat{p}=0$, and the standard Wald interval $\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})/n}$ collapses to the point $[0,0]$, which is nonsensical. The normal approximation fails catastrophically. The second part proposes a remedy: using a normal approximation for $\\mathrm{logit}(\\hat{p})$. However, $\\mathrm{logit}(\\hat{p}) = \\log(\\hat{p}/(1-\\hat{p}))$. If $\\hat{p}=0$, $\\mathrm{logit}(0)$ is undefined (as is the variance estimator for $\\mathrm{logit}(\\hat{p})$). So the method, as stated, cannot even be applied. While there are workarounds (e.g., adding a small constant like $0.5$ to $x$ and $n-x$), the resulting interval is still an approximation. The claim that it \"always produces exact coverage\" is false for the same reason as in option D: no continuous approximation-based interval for a discrete parameter can have exact coverage for all parameter values.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Summary of Correct Options\nStatements A, C, and E correctly identify failures of normal approximations in the context of sparse data and propose appropriate, theoretically sound \"exact\" remedies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "4980553"}]}
