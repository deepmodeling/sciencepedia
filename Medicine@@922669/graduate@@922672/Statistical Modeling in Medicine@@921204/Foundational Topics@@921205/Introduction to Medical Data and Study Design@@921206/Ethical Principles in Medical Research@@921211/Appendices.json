To operationalize the Belmont Report principle of justice in subject selection, the IRB applies a disparity metric that compares the representation of a demographic group in the study sample to that group’s disease burden in the target population. Let the sample proportion of Group A be denoted by $p_{\\text{sample}}$ and the disease prevalence proportion of Group A in the target population be denoted by $p_{\\text{prevalence}}$. The IRB’s justice disparity score is defined as the absolute deviation\n$$\nD = \\left| p_{\\text{sample}} - p_{\\text{prevalence}} \\right|.\n$$\nThe IRB has adopted a policy threshold $ \\tau = 0.10 $ such that recruitment is considered ethically adequate if and only if $D \\le \\tau$.\n\nIn a proposed study, Group A comprises $p_{\\text{sample}} = 0.20$ of enrolled participants, and the disease prevalence in Group A is $p_{\\text{prevalence}} = 0.35$ in the target population.\n\nUsing only the definitions above and standard properties of absolute value, compute the justice disparity score $D$ for this study and, based on the IRB policy, determine whether recruitment is ethically adequate.

The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of research ethics, and mathematically well-posed. All necessary data and definitions are provided.\n\nThe justice disparity score $D$ is defined as the absolute deviation between the sample proportion of a demographic group, $p_{\\text{sample}}$, and that group's disease prevalence proportion in the target population, $p_{\\text{prevalence}}$. The formula is given as:\n$$\nD = |p_{\\text{sample}} - p_{\\text{prevalence}}|\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values for the study in question:\n- The sample proportion of Group A is $p_{\\text{sample}} = 0.20$.\n- The disease prevalence proportion for Group A in the target population is $p_{\\text{prevalence}} = 0.35$.\n\nTo compute the value of $D$, we substitute these given values into the defining equation:\n$$\nD = |0.20 - 0.35|\n$$\nFirst, we perform the subtraction inside the absolute value operator:\n$$\n0.20 - 0.35 = -0.15\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for $D$:\n$$\nD = |-0.15|\n$$\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, which is always non-negative.

This practice challenges you to quantify potential harm using the fundamental concept of expected value, a tool that combines the probability of an adverse event with its severity. This exercise demonstrates how abstract risk concepts are made concrete, allowing IRBs to apply a consistent and objective standard when evaluating study protocols [@problem_id:4794376].", "problem": "A pragmatic clinical study is proposed to evaluate a low-burden intervention for improving adherence. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) applies a quantitative screening criterion based on the minimal risk principle from the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (Common Rule): a study is considered minimal risk if the expected harm per participant is less than a benchmark consistent with risks ordinarily encountered in daily life. For screening purposes, the IRB sets a benchmark of $T_{\\min} = 0.001$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of expected harm per participant.\n\nIn the proposed study, an adverse event has probability $p = 0.01$ per participant, and if it occurs it causes a health loss with severity weight $w = 0.5$ QALYs.

The final answer must be the expected total harm only.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory and clinical research ethics, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first formalizing the harm for a single participant and then extending the analysis to the entire sample.\n\nLet $H_i$ be the random variable representing the harm, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), experienced by participant $i$, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$. The problem states that a participant experiences a health loss of magnitude $w$ if an adverse event occurs, and zero harm otherwise. The probability of an adverse event is $p$.\n\nThe possible outcomes for $H_i$ are:\n- $H_i = w$ with probability $p$.\n- $H_i = 0$ with probability $1-p$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Probability of adverse event, $p = 0.01$.\n- Severity weight of health loss, $w = 0.5$ QALYs.\n- Sample size, $n = 300$.\n- IRB minimal risk benchmark, $T_{\\min} = 0.001$ QALYs.\n\n**1. Expected Harm Per Participant and Minimal Risk Criterion**\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the expected harm per participant. We use the definition of the expected value of a discrete random variable, $E[X] = \\sum_j x_j P(X=x_j)$. For a single participant, the expected harm, denoted $E[H_i]$, is:\n$$\nE[H_i] = w \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p)\n$$\n$$\nE[H_i] = w \\cdot p\n$$\nSubstituting the given values for $w$ and $p$:\n$$\nE[H_i] = 0.5 \\times 0.01 = 0.005 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\nSo, the expected harm per participant is $0.005$ QALYs.\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine whether the study satisfies the Institutional Review Board's (IRB) minimal risk criterion. The criterion states that the study is considered minimal risk if the expected harm per participant is less than the benchmark $T_{\\min} = 0.001$ QALYs.\n\nComparing the calculated expected harm per participant to the benchmark:\n$$\nE[H_i] = 0.005 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\min} = 0.001 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\nSince $0.005 > 0.001$, the expected harm per participant exceeds the IRB's benchmark. Therefore, the study does not satisfy the minimal risk criterion on a per-participant basis.\n\n**2. Expected Total Harm**\n\nThe final part of the task is to derive the expected total harm across the planned sample of $n$ participants. The total harm, $H_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the harms for each participant. This is based on the stated assumption that harms are additive.\n$$\nH_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} H_i\n$$\nThe expected total harm, $E[H_{\\text{total}}]$, can be calculated using the linearity of the expectation operator. The expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations.\n$$\nE[H_{\\text{total}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} H_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[H_i]\n$$\nSince each participant is subject to the same statistical model of harm, the expected harm $E[H_i]$ is the same for all participants. Thus, the sum simplifies to:\n$$\nE[H_{\\text{total}}] = n \\cdot E[H_i]\n$$\nNote that this result relies only on the linearity of expectation and does not require the assumption of independence between adverse events across participants, although that assumption was provided.\n\nSubstituting the known values for $n$ and the previously calculated $E[H_i]$:\n$$\nE[H_{\\text{total}}] = 300 \\times 0.005 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\n$$\nE[H_{\\text{total}}] = 1.5 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\nThe expected total harm across the entire planned sample is $1.5$ QALYs.
