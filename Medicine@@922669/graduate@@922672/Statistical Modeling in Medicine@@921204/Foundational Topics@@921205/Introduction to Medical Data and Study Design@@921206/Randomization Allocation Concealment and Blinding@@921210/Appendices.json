Let the continuous outcomes from the treatment and control arms be represented by random variables $X_{T,i}$ for $i=1, \\dots, n_T$ and $X_{C,j}$ for $j=1, \\dots, n_C$. According to the problem statement, these are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) normal random variables:\n$$X_{T,i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_T, \\sigma^2)$$\n$$X_{C,j} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_C, \\sigma^2)$$\nThe sample means for each arm are $\\bar{X}_T = \\frac{1}{n_T}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_T} X_{T,i}$ and $\\bar{X}_C = \\frac{1}{n_C}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_C} X_{C,j}$.

Since the arms are independent, $\\hat{\\delta}$ is also normally distributed. Its expectation is $E[\\hat{\\delta}] = E[\\bar{X}_T] - E[\\bar{X}_C] = \\mu_T - \\mu_C = \\delta$.

The problem states that the blinding index, $BI$, is a linear function of $p$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$\nBI(p) = ap + b\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are constants to be determined. We use the given anchor conditions to find $a$ and $b$.\n\n- **Condition 1**: Perfect unmasking with all guesses incorrect. This corresponds to a probability of correct guess $p=0$. The index for this case is specified as $BI(0) = -1$.\n$$\nBI(0) = a(0) + b = -1 \\implies b = -1\n$$\n\n- **Condition 2**: Perfect unmasking with all guesses correct. This corresponds to a probability of correct guess $p=1$. The index for this case is specified as $BI(1) = 1$.\n$$\nBI(1) = a(1) + b = 1\n$$\nSubstituting $b=-1$ into this equation gives:\n$$\na - 1 = 1 \\implies a = 2\n$$\n\nThus, the formula for the blinding index is:\n$$\nBI(p) = 2p - 1\n$$\n\nWe must verify this formula with the third condition: chance-level guessing. This corresponds to a probability of correct guess $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, for which the index should be $BI(\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$.\n$$\nBI\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nThe formula is consistent with all three specified conditions. This index is a variant of the James' Blinding Index.\n\n#### 2. Estimation of the Index for Active and Placebo Arms\n\nWe first organize the data to calculate the estimated probabilities of a correct guess for each arm.\n\nFor the **Active arm**:\n- Number of subjects who correctly guessed \"Active\" ($N_{AA}$): $51$.\n- Number of subjects who incorrectly guessed \"Placebo\" ($N_{AP}$): $99$.\n- Total number of subjects in the Active arm ($n_A$): $n_A = N_{AA} + N_{AP} = 51 + 99 = 150$.\n\nThe estimated probability of a correct guess in the Active arm, $\\hat{p}_A$, is the proportion of subjects in that arm who guessed correctly:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_A = \\frac{N_{AA}}{n_A} = \\frac{51}{150} = 0.34\n$$\nThe corresponding blinding index for the Active arm, $BI_A$, is:\n$$\nBI_A = 2\\hat{p}_A - 1 = 2(0.34) - 1 = 0.68 - 1 = -0.32\n$$\n\nFor the **Placebo arm**:\n- Number of subjects who incorrectly guessed \"Active\" ($N_{PA}$): $60$.\n- Number of subjects who correctly guessed \"Placebo\" ($N_{PP}$): $120$.\n- Total number of subjects in the Placebo arm ($n_P$): $n_P = N_{PA} + N_{PP} = 60 + 120 = 180$.\n\nThe estimated probability of a correct guess in the Placebo arm, $\\hat{p}_P$, is the proportion of subjects in that arm who guessed correctly:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_P = \\frac{N_{PP}}{n_P} = \\frac{120}{180} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe corresponding blinding index for the Placebo arm, $BI_P$, is:\n$$\nBI_P = 2\\hat{p}_P - 1 = 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - 1 = \\frac{4}{3} - 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nAs a decimal, $BI_P = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.33333...$.\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures as requested:\n- $BI_A = -0.3200$\n- $BI_P \\approx 0.3333$\n\n#### 3. Interpretation of Blinding Index Values\n\nBased on the derivation of the index $BI(p) = 2p - 1$:\n- A value of $BI \\approx 1$ corresponds to $p \\approx 1$. This indicates a severe failure of blinding, where participants are able to correctly identify their assigned treatment arm far better than chance.\n- A value of $BI \\approx 0$ corresponds to $p \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$. This suggests that participants are guessing their allocation at a rate consistent with pure chance, which is the desired outcome for a successfully masked trial.\n- A value of $BI \\approx -1$ corresponds to $p \\approx 0$. This indicates a severe failure of blinding where participants systematically guess the *opposite* of their true allocation. This form of unmasking might occur if, for example, side effects of a placebo are misinterpreted as signs of an active treatment, or vice-versa.\n\nIn this specific case, the $BI_A = -0.3200$ suggests that patients in the active arm tended to guess they were on placebo more often than chance would predict, indicating some degree of \"opposite\" unmasking. The $BI_P = 0.3333$ suggests that patients in the placebo arm were better than chance at guessing their allocation, indicating some unmasking in the direction of correct identification.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.3200 & 0.3333 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4982173"}]}
