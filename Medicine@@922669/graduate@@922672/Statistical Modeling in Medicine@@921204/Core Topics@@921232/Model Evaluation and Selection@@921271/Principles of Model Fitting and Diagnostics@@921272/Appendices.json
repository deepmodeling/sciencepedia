We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a statistical test to compare two nested models: a reduced model $\\mathcal{M}_{R}$ where the effect of serum creatinine $C$ is linear, and a full model $\\mathcal{M}_{F}$ where the effect is represented by a more complex nonlinear function (a restricted cubic spline). The appropriate statistical procedure for this comparison is the likelihood ratio test (LRT).\n\nThe null and alternative hypotheses for this test are:\n$H_{0}$: The relationship between the log-odds of mortality and serum creatinine $C$ is linear. The additional parameters for nonlinearity in the full model are zero. This corresponds to the reduced model $\\mathcal{M}_{R}$.\n$H_{A}$: The relationship is nonlinear as specified by the restricted cubic spline function. At least one of the additional nonlinear parameters is non-zero. This corresponds to the full model $\\mathcal{M}_{F}$.\n\nThe likelihood ratio test statistic, which we will denote as $\\Lambda_{LR}$, is calculated based on the maximized log-likelihoods of the two models, $\\ell_{R}$ and $\\ell_{F}$. The statistic is given by:\n$$ \\Lambda_{LR} = 2 (\\ell_{F} - \\ell_{R}) $$\nAlternatively, it can be defined using the model deviances, $D_R$ and $D_F$, where deviance is defined as $D = -2\\ell$.\n$$ \\Lambda_{LR} = -2\\ell_{R} - (-2\\ell_{F}) = D_{R} - D_{F} $$\n\nUsing the provided values for the log-likelihoods:\n- Log-likelihood of the reduced model, $\\ell_{R} = -629.124$.\n- Log-likelihood of the full model, $\\ell_{F} = -624.450$.\n\nThe test statistic is calculated as:\n$$ \\Lambda_{LR} = 2 (-624.450 - (-629.124)) = 2 (-624.450 + 629.124) = 2(4.674) = 9.348 $$\n\nTo verify, we can use the deviance values:\n- Deviance of the reduced model, $D_{R} = 1258.248$.\n- Deviance of the full model, $D_{F} = 1248.900$.\n\nThe test statistic is:\n$$ \\Lambda_{LR} = 1258.248 - 1248.900 = 9.348 $$\nThe results are identical, confirming the calculation.

The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)\n\nThe goal of AIC is to select a model that provides the best predictive performance on new, unseen data from the same data-generating process. It formalizes the trade-off between model fit (goodness-of-fit) and model complexity. The framework is based on minimizing the expected Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true, unknown data-generating distribution, $f(x)$, and the distribution represented by the fitted model, $g(x|\\hat{\\theta})$, where $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the model parameters.\n\nThe KL divergence is defined as:\n$$\nD_{\\text{KL}}(f || g) = \\int f(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x|\\hat{\\theta})}\\right) dx = E_{f(x)}[\\ln f(x)] - E_{f(x)}[\\ln g(x|\\hat{\\theta})]\n$$\nTo select a model, we wish to find the model $g$ that minimizes this divergence. Since $E_{f(x)}[\\ln f(x)]$ is a constant across all models, this is equivalent to maximizing the expected log-likelihood of the model under the true distribution, $E_{f(x)}[\\ln g(x|\\hat{\\theta})]$.\n\nThe challenge is that we do not know $f(x)$ and we only have a single dataset, which yields a single estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$. The in-sample maximized log-likelihood, $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln g(x_i|\\hat{\\theta})$, is a biased estimator of the expected out-of-sample log-likelihood. Akaike showed that, under certain regularity conditions and for large samples, the bias is approximately equal to the number of estimated parameters, $k$.\n\nSpecifically, he demonstrated that an approximately unbiased estimator of the target quantity (which is proportional to the expected KL divergence) is given by the maximized log-likelihood penalized by the number of parameters.\nThe expected value of the maximized log-likelihood can be related to the true expected log-likelihood by the following asymptotic relationship:\n$$\nE_{\\text{data}} \\left[ E_{f(y)}[\\ln g(y|\\hat{\\theta})] \\right] \\approx E_{\\text{data}}[\\ell(\\hat{\\theta})] - k\n$$\nwhere $y$ represents a new data point. Thus, $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) - k$ is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the expected predictive log-likelihood (up to a scaling factor $n$). To place the criterion on a deviance-like scale, it is conventional to multiply by $-2$. This yields the Akaike Information Criterion:\n$$\n\\text{AIC} = -2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + 2k\n$$\nwhere $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta})$ is the maximized log-likelihood of the model and $k$ is the number of free parameters. The model with the lowest AIC value is preferred, as it is estimated to have the lowest information loss and thus the best out-of-sample predictive performance.\n\n### Derivation of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\n\nThe BIC, or Schwarz Criterion, arises from a Bayesian perspective on model selection. The goal is to choose the model with the highest posterior probability, given the data $D$. Let $\\{M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_m\\}$ be the set of candidate models. By Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of a model $M_j$ is:\n$$\nP(M_j|D) = \\frac{P(D|M_j) P(M_j)}{P(D)}\n$$\nIf we assume that all models have equal prior probability, $P(M_j) = \\text{constant}$, then selecting the model with the highest posterior probability is equivalent to selecting the model that maximizes the marginal likelihood, $P(D|M_j)$. The marginal likelihood is calculated by integrating the likelihood over the entire parameter space $\\Theta_j$ of the model, weighted by the prior distribution of the parameters $P(\\theta|M_j)$:\n$$\nP(D|M_j) = \\int_{\\Theta_j} P(D|\\theta, M_j) P(\\theta|M_j) d\\theta\n$$\nHere, $P(D|\\theta, M_j)$ is the likelihood function $L(\\theta|D)$. This integral is often intractable. For large sample sizes $n$, we can use the Laplace approximation. Let $\\ell(\\theta) = \\ln L(\\theta|D)$ be the log-likelihood. We can form a second-order Taylor expansion of $\\ell(\\theta)$ around its maximum, the MLE $\\hat{\\theta}$:\n$$\n\\ell(\\theta) \\approx \\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})^T \\nabla\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})^T \\nabla^2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})\n$$\nSince $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the MLE, the gradient $\\nabla\\ell(\\hat{\\theta})$ is zero. The term $\\nabla^2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta})$ is the Hessian matrix $H$. For a large sample, $-H$ can be approximated by the Fisher Information matrix, $I(\\hat{\\theta})$, which scales with $n$.\nThe integral for the marginal likelihood becomes:\n$$\nP(D|M_j) \\approx \\int \\exp\\left(\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})^T H (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})\\right) P(\\theta|M_j) d\\theta\n$$\nAssuming the prior $P(\\theta|M_j)$ is relatively flat near $\\hat{\\theta}$, we can approximate it by its value at the MLE, $P(\\hat{\\theta}|M_j)$, and pull it outside the integral.\n$$\nP(D|M_j) \\approx \\exp(\\ell(\\hat{\\theta})) P(\\hat{\\theta}|M_j) \\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})^T (-H) (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})\\right) d\\theta\n$$\nThe integral is of a multivariate Gaussian form. Its value is $(2\\pi)^{k/2} |-H|^{-1/2}$. Asymptotically, the observed Fisher information $-H$ is approximately $n$ times the Fisher information for a single observation, so $|-H| \\propto n^k$. Substituting this back:\n$$\nP(D|M_j) \\propto L(\\hat{\\theta}) n^{-k/2}\n$$\nTaking the logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln P(D|M_j) \\approx \\ln L(\\hat{\\theta}) - \\frac{k}{2} \\ln(n) = \\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) - \\frac{k}{2} \\ln(n)\n$$\nwhere terms that do not grow with $n$ have been dropped. Conventionally, BIC is defined on a deviance scale by multiplying by $-2$:\n$$\n\\text{BIC} = -2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + k \\ln(n)\n$$\nThe model with the lowest BIC value is preferred. BIC penalizes model complexity more heavily than AIC for any $n  e^2 \\approx 7.4$. Its aim is consistency: if the true model is among the candidates, BIC will select it with probability approaching $1$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\n### Application to the Models\n\nWe are given $n=1000$.\nFor Model $1$: $k_1 = 10$, $\\ell_1 = -520$.\nFor Model $2$: $k_2 = 15$, $\\ell_2 = -505$.\n\n**AIC Calculation:**\nThe formula is $\\text{AIC} = -2\\ell + 2k$.\nFor Model $1$:\n$$\n\\text{AIC}_1 = -2(-520) + 2(10) = 1040 + 20 = 1060\n$$\nFor Model $2$:\n$$\n\\text{AIC}_2 = -2(-505) + 2(15) = 1010 + 30 = 1040\n$$\n\n**BIC Calculation:**\nThe formula is $\\text{BIC} = -2\\ell + k \\ln(n)$.\nFor Model $1$:\n$$\n\\text{BIC}_1 = -2(-520) + 10 \\ln(1000) = 1040 + 10 \\ln(1000)\n$$\nFor Model $2$:\n$$\n\\text{BIC}_2 = -2(-505) + 15 \\ln(1000) = 1010 + 15 \\ln(1000)\n$$\n\n### Model Comparison\n\n**AIC Comparison:**\nWe compare $\\text{AIC}_1 = 1060$ and $\\text{AIC}_2 = 1040$. Since lower AIC indicates a better model, we look for the minimum value.\n$$\n1040  1060 \\implies \\text{AIC}_2  \\text{AIC}_1\n$$\nTherefore, AIC prefers Model $2$. The indicator $a_{\\text{AIC}}$ is $2$.\n\n**BIC Comparison:**\nWe compare $\\text{BIC}_1 = 1040 + 10 \\ln(1000)$ and $\\text{BIC}_2 = 1010 + 15 \\ln(1000)$.\nTo determine which is smaller, let's examine their difference:\n$$\n\\text{BIC}_2 - \\text{BIC}_1 = (1010 + 15 \\ln(1000)) - (1040 + 10 \\ln(1000))\n$$\n$$\n\\text{BIC}_2 - \\text{BIC}_1 = (1010 - 1040) + (15 - 10)\\ln(1000) = -30 + 5 \\ln(1000)\n$$\nWe need to determine the sign of this difference. This depends on whether $5 \\ln(1000)$ is greater or less than $30$. This inequality is equivalent to $\\ln(1000)  6$, or $1000  e^6$.\nWe know $e \\approx 2.718$, so $e^2 \\approx 7.389$ and $e^3 \\approx 20.086$.\nThen $e^6 = (e^3)^2 \\approx (20.086)^2 \\approx 403.4$.\nSince $1000  403.4$, it is true that $\\ln(1000)  6$.\nTherefore, $5 \\ln(1000)  30$, which implies that $\\text{BIC}_2 - \\text{BIC}_1  0$, or $\\text{BIC}_2  \\text{BIC}_1$.\nSince lower BIC indicates a better model, BIC prefers Model $1$.

Logistic regression is a standard method for modeling binary outcomes like mortality. DFBETA is a classical and widely used case-deletion influence diagnostic, applicable to generalized linear models, including logistic regression. The context of critical care medicine, using predictors like lactate and age for mortality, is a realistic and common application of such models.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information ($n=325$ and the specific $|DFBETA|$ value) to apply standard interpretation rules for influence diagnostics. It asks for an evaluation based on established principles, which points toward a well-defined answer within the field of applied statistics.\n-   **Objective:** The problem statement is objective. \"Unusually high lactate\" is presented as a characteristic of the patient that prompted the diagnostic check, a standard practice, rather than a subjective claim. The values are given numerically. The question itself directs the solver to use \"principled considerations\" and \"commonly used thresholds\", avoiding subjectivity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will now proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the interpretation of the DFBETA value for a single observation. DFBETA is a diagnostic that quantifies the influence of an observation on a specific regression coefficient. The problem states that the computed value is a \"standardized change,\" which is typically denoted as DFBETAS. For a coefficient $\\beta_j$ and an observation $i$, DFBETAS is calculated as:\n$$DFBETAS_{i,j} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_j - \\hat{\\beta}_{j(i)}}{SE_{(i)}(\\hat{\\beta}_j)}$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ is the coefficient estimated using the full dataset, $\\hat{\\beta}_{j(i)}$ is the coefficient estimated with observation $i$ deleted, and $SE_{(i)}(\\hat{\\beta}_j)$ is the standard error of the coefficient from the model fit without observation $i$. This diagnostic measures the change in the coefficient in units of its standard error.\n\nThe question is how to interpret the magnitude $|DFBETAS| = 0.35$ in a study with $n=325$. There are two common rules of thumb for identifying influential points using DFBETAS:\n\n1.  **Absolute Threshold:** Some practitioners consider an observation influential if $|DFBETAS|  1$ or, more conservatively, $|DFBETAS|  2$. A value of $|DFBETAS|  1$ means that deleting the single observation shifts the coefficient estimate by more than one standard error, which is a substantial change.\n2.  **Sample-Size–Adjusted Threshold:** A more widely recommended threshold, particularly for larger datasets, was proposed by Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch. They suggest that an observation is potentially influential if its $|DFBETAS|$ value exceeds $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}}$. This threshold accounts for the fact that in a large sample, any single observation is expected to have a smaller influence.\n\nLet's apply the sample-size-adjusted threshold to the given problem:\n-   Sample size: $n = 325$.\n-   Threshold: $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{325}}$.\n\nTo evaluate this, we can approximate $\\sqrt{325}$:\n$\\sqrt{325} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 13} = 5\\sqrt{13}$.\nSince $3.6^2 = 12.96$ and $3.7^2 = 13.69$, $\\sqrt{13}$ is slightly greater than $3.6$. A more precise value is $\\sqrt{325} \\approx 18.028$.\nThe threshold is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{2}{18.028} \\approx 0.111 $$\nWe are given that for the patient in question, $|DFBETA| = 0.35$.\nComparing the observed value to the threshold:\n$$ 0.35  0.111 $$\nThe observed $|DFBETA|$ for the lactate coefficient substantially exceeds the sample-size–adjusted threshold. Therefore, according to this standard criterion, the patient is an influential observation for the lactate coefficient.\n\nThe next step is to decide on the appropriate course of action. Identifying a point as \"influential\" does not automatically mean it should be deleted. Automatic deletion is poor statistical practice, as it can introduce bias by censoring valid data and may result in a model that poorly represents the underlying population. The purpose of influence diagnostics is to flag cases for further scrutiny. The principled approach includes:\n1.  **Data Verification:** Check the patient's record for data entry errors or measurement artifacts. Was the lactate value of this patient recorded correctly?\n2.  **Plausibility Check:** Assess if the observed values, while extreme, are clinically and biologically plausible.\n3.  **Sensitivity Analysis:** Refit the model without the influential observation and compare the results (coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and overall conclusions) to the original model. The impact of this single case on the study's conclusions should be understood and reported.\n\nBased on this analysis, the patient is indeed influential, and the correct action involves careful review and sensitivity analysis, not automatic exclusion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because the sample size is $n=325$, the magnitude $|DFBETA|=0.35$ indicates the patient is influential for the lactate coefficient by exceeding a sample-size–adjusted threshold; the case warrants review and sensitivity analysis, but automatic exclusion is not justified.**\n-   This option correctly identifies that influence should be judged relative to sample size. It correctly applies the principle, as we calculated the threshold to be $\\approx 0.11$, which $0.35$ exceeds. It then recommends the correct course of action in applied statistics: review and sensitivity analysis, while explicitly cautioning against automatic exclusion. This statement is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because $|DFBETA|=0.351$, the patient is not influential; no further action is needed.**\n-   This option uses an absolute threshold of $|DFBETA|  1$. While this is a valid (though less sensitive) rule of thumb for identifying *highly* influential points, ignoring any point below this threshold is not advisable, especially when the more sensitive size-adjusted threshold ($0.111$ in this case) is clearly exceeded. Declaring the patient \"not influential\" and that \"no further action is needed\" is incorrect and dismissive of standard diagnostic procedures.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In logistic regression, any $|DFBETA|0.30$ mandates removal of the case to preserve unbiasedness of the coefficient estimates.**\n-   This statement is flawed on multiple grounds. First, there is no universal, rigid threshold of $0.30$ for DFBETA. Second, and more critically, an influential point does not *mandate* removal. Automatic removal is poor practice. Third, removing a valid (but extreme) data point can itself introduce bias, leading to a model that is not representative of the full spectrum of patient characteristics.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Thresholds for DFBETA do not apply to logistic regression; only Cook’s distance should be used for influence in binary outcome models.**\n-   This statement is factually incorrect. DFBETA and DFBETAS are standard diagnostics for generalized linear models (GLMs), of which logistic regression is a prominent member. While Cook's distance is another important influence measure (assessing overall influence on all coefficients), it serves a different purpose than DFBETA, which assesses influence on a single, specific coefficient. Both are valid and commonly used for logistic regression.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Since $|DFBETA|=0.351$, the patient severely distorts the model and the coefficient for lactate must be refit without this patient.**\n-   The premise of this option contains a fundamental mathematical error: the claim that $0.35  1$ is false. Furthermore, even if the value had been greater than $1$, the conclusion that the model *must* be refit without the patient is too strong and represents poor statistical practice, as explained in the analysis of option C.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4979343"}]}
