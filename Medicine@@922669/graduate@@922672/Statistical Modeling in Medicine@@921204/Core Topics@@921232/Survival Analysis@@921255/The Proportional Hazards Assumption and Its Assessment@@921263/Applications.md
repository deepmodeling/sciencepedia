## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The principles and mechanisms for assessing the [proportional hazards](@entry_id:166780) (PH) assumption, as detailed in the previous chapter, are not merely theoretical exercises. They form an indispensable part of the toolkit for any researcher applying survival analysis to real-world data. Failure to critically evaluate this core assumption can lead to misspecified models, biased estimates, and erroneous scientific conclusions. Conversely, a thorough assessment often yields deeper insights into the dynamic nature of the processes under study. This chapter explores the application of these diagnostic principles across a range of common and advanced scenarios in medicine, epidemiology, and public health, demonstrating their utility in contexts from prognostic modeling to complex clinical trial design.

### Core Application in Clinical Research: Prognostic Modeling

One of the most frequent applications of the Cox proportional hazards model is in the development of prognostic models in clinical research. These models aim to identify factors that predict patient outcomes, such as time to disease relapse or death. The process involves specifying a model, estimating the effects of various covariates, and interpreting their prognostic significance. The assessment of the PH assumption is a crucial step in validating such a model.

Consider a typical retrospective cohort study, for instance, one investigating the risk of surgical site infections following a specific procedure. A Cox model might be specified to assess the effect of an antibiotic regimen while adjusting for patient characteristics like age, sex, and comorbidities. The model would take the form:
$$
h(t \mid \mathbf{X}) = h_0(t)\,\exp\{\beta_1\,\text{ExtAbx} + \beta_2\,\text{Age} + \dots\}
$$
The estimated hazard ratio for the antibiotic regimen, $\widehat{\text{HR}} = \exp(\hat{\beta}_1)$, is interpreted as the multiplicative effect on the instantaneous risk (hazard) of infection at any time $t$, assuming this effect is constant over the follow-up period. A similar prognostic modeling approach is standard in oncology, for example, when assessing the impact of cytogenetic risk categories (e.g., favorable, intermediate, adverse) on the time to relapse in acute myeloid leukemia. In such a model, the coefficients for the [indicator variables](@entry_id:266428) representing these categories correspond to the natural logarithm of their respective hazard ratios relative to a reference group [@problem_id:5095557].

In both scenarios, before the model's conclusions can be trusted, the PH assumption must be verified for each covariate. The primary diagnostic tool for this is the analysis of Schoenfeld residuals. As established previously, under the PH assumption, the expectation of these residuals is zero over time. A graphical plot of scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time (or a transformation of time, such as its logarithm) should therefore show a random scatter around a horizontal line at zero. A systematic trend—such as a smooth, monotonically increasing or decreasing pattern, or a non-linear U-shape—is strong evidence of a non-proportional hazard, indicating that the covariate's effect changes over time [@problem_id:4991130] [@problem_id:4987377]. Formal tests, such as the Grambsch-Therneau test, quantify this by testing for a non-zero slope in the regression of scaled residuals on time, providing a p-value for the null hypothesis of proportionality [@problem_id:4631691].

### Extensions for Complex Data Structures

Real-world studies often involve data structures that introduce additional complexity, requiring careful adaptation of survival models and their diagnostics. Key examples include time-dependent covariates and clustered data.

#### Time-Dependent Covariates

Covariates are not always fixed at baseline. Many factors, such as biomarker levels or exposure to environmental agents, change over the course of a study. The Cox model can accommodate such time-dependent covariates (TDCs), but their inclusion requires careful consideration. A critical distinction must be made between *external* and *internal* TDCs.

An **external** TDC is one whose path is not influenced by the individual's health status or the event process. Examples include ambient air pollution or a pre-scheduled, fixed treatment change. These can be incorporated into a Cox model, typically by partitioning the follow-up time into intervals (the "start-stop" format), without introducing bias. The PH assumption for other baseline covariates remains interpretable and can be assessed using standard methods like Schoenfeld residuals [@problem_id:4991183].

An **internal** TDC, in contrast, is a variable whose own trajectory is part of the individual's health process. A classic example is a biomarker measured at clinic visits, where the frequency and timing of visits may be influenced by the patient's deteriorating condition. Naively including such a TDC in a Cox model can lead to significant bias. For instance, using the time to achieve a specific biomarker state (e.g., Minimal Residual Disease negativity in leukemia) as a fixed baseline predictor induces **immortal time bias**, because a patient must survive relapse-free up to that time to be classified, artificially inflating their apparent survival [@problem_id:5133639]. Correctly handling internal TDCs requires advanced methods, such as modeling the covariate as a time-varying indicator, using landmark analysis, or employing joint models for the longitudinal and survival data [@problem_id:4991183] [@problem_id:5133639]. When these methods are used, the PH assumption must still be assessed, and violations—often observed as crossing Kaplan-Meier curves—indicate that the effect of the time-dependent status itself changes over time, requiring models with time-varying coefficients.

#### Clustered and Correlated Data

In many studies, such as multicenter clinical trials or family-based studies, observations are naturally grouped into clusters (e.g., patients within hospitals). The outcomes of individuals within the same cluster are often correlated due to shared unmeasured factors. This [unobserved heterogeneity](@entry_id:142880) can have profound implications for the [proportional hazards assumption](@entry_id:163597).

One way to conceptualize this is through a shared frailty model, where the hazard for an individual is conditional on an unobserved cluster-specific random effect, or frailty. For instance, the hazard for patient $i$ in cluster $c$ might be $h(t \mid x, u_c) = h_0(t)\,\exp(x^\top \beta + u_c)$. Even if the PH assumption holds at the conditional level (given the frailty $u_c$), the heterogeneity induces a selection effect over time: subjects in high-risk clusters (high frailty) tend to have events earlier, leaving a pool of lower-risk subjects at later times. This causes the *marginal* hazard ratio, averaged over the frailty distribution, to attenuate over time, thus violating the PH assumption at the population level [@problem_id:4991160].

A common alternative to explicitly modeling frailty is to fit a marginal Cox model and use a cluster-robust "sandwich" variance estimator to account for the correlation. When assessing the PH assumption for such a model, it is crucial to recognize that the Schoenfeld residuals will also be correlated within clusters. Therefore, a standard Grambsch-Therneau test, which assumes independent residuals, would be invalid and could have an inflated Type I error rate. The correct procedure is to perform the regression of scaled residuals on time but to use a cluster-robust variance estimator for the slope coefficient. This corrects the inference on the trend without changing the residuals themselves, providing a valid diagnostic for the marginal model's PH assumption [@problem_id:4991138].

### Advanced Application: Competing Risks Survival Analysis

In many medical contexts, subjects are at risk of multiple, mutually exclusive event types. For example, a patient with chronic kidney disease may experience dialysis initiation, cardiovascular death, or non-cardiovascular death. The occurrence of one event (e.g., cardiovascular death) precludes the occurrence of the others. This is the competing risks setting, and it requires specialized analytical methods. The assessment of the PH assumption is equally critical here, but its application depends on the modeling framework chosen.

The most common approach for etiological questions is to model the **cause-specific hazard (CSH)** for each event type. The CSH for cause $k$, $h_k(t \mid x)$, is the instantaneous rate of failure from cause $k$ among those who are currently event-free. This is analyzed by fitting a separate Cox model for each cause, where events from all other competing causes are treated as censored observations. The PH assumption can and should be assessed independently within each of these cause-specific models using standard diagnostics like Schoenfeld residuals. A violation for one cause does not imply a violation for another, reflecting the distinct underlying pathologies [@problem_id:4991144] [@problem_id:4991131].

An alternative framework, often used for predicting absolute risk, models the **subdistribution hazard (SDH)**, popularized by the Fine-Gray model. The SDH for cause $k$ is the [instantaneous failure rate](@entry_id:171877) among a risk set that includes not only event-free individuals but also those who have already failed from a competing cause. Because the risk sets and the quantities being modeled are fundamentally different, the PH assumption for the CSH is a distinct concept from the proportional subdistribution hazards (PSH) assumption for the SDH. A constant cause-specific hazard ratio generally does *not* imply a constant subdistribution hazard ratio, and vice versa. This is because the SDH ratio is a complex function of the CSHs of both the primary and competing events. The only scenario where they coincide is in the trivial case of no competing risks [@problem_id:4991154]. Consequently, if a Fine-Gray model is used, its PSH assumption must be assessed directly using diagnostics developed for that model, such as Schoenfeld-type residuals based on its unique risk set or by testing for time-dependent [interaction terms](@entry_id:637283) [@problem_id:4579849].

### Modeling and Inference in the Presence of Non-Proportional Hazards

The detection of a PH violation should not be seen as a failure of the analysis, but rather as a discovery of a more complex, time-dependent relationship. When the effect of a covariate on the hazard changes over time, several strategies can be employed for both estimation and inference.

A direct approach is to extend the Cox model to explicitly incorporate a time-varying coefficient. This can be done by including an [interaction term](@entry_id:166280) between the covariate and a function of time. A simple and interpretable choice is a piecewise constant effect, where the follow-up time is partitioned by a cutpoint $c$, and the model is $\eta(t; x) = \beta x + \gamma x \cdot \mathbf{1}\{t > c\}$. The PH assumption is then tested by a [likelihood ratio test](@entry_id:170711) of the null hypothesis $H_0: \gamma = 0$. More flexible functions, such as [splines](@entry_id:143749) or kernel smoothers, can also be used to model the shape of the time-varying effect [@problem_id:4776354].

In the context of confirmatory clinical trials, where pre-specification and control of Type I error are paramount, the possibility of non-[proportional hazards](@entry_id:166780) poses a significant challenge. A naive two-stage procedure—first testing for PH and then choosing a model based on the outcome—invalidates the Type I error rate of the final efficacy test. Modern statistical analysis plans address this by decoupling the primary hypothesis test from the estimation strategy. A robust primary test, such as a "MaxCombo" test that combines the standard [log-rank test](@entry_id:168043) with several weighted log-rank tests sensitive to different patterns of non-PH, can be pre-specified. This single test provides valid inference regardless of whether the PH assumption holds. The PH diagnostics are then used purely for descriptive purposes to guide the pre-specified estimation approach. For example, the plan might state that if the PH assumption is not rejected, the constant hazard ratio from a Cox model will be reported; if it is rejected, a pre-specified piecewise-constant HR will be reported instead. This approach ensures both inferential rigor and scientific transparency [@problem_id:4991178].

### Conclusion

The assessment of the [proportional hazards assumption](@entry_id:163597) is a cornerstone of rigorous [time-to-event analysis](@entry_id:163785). As this chapter has demonstrated, its application extends far beyond a simple check on a basic model. It is a vital diagnostic in complex prognostic studies, in models with time-dependent covariates, in the analysis of clustered data, and in the nuanced field of [competing risks](@entry_id:173277). Furthermore, understanding how to model and test for effects in the presence of non-proportionality is essential for the design and interpretation of modern clinical trials. By embracing these diagnostic tools, researchers can not only ensure the validity of their models but also uncover richer, more dynamic insights into the processes shaping survival outcomes.
