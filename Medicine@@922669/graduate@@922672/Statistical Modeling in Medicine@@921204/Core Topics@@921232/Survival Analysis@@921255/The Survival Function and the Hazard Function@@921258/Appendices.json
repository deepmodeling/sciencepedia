The problem is scientifically grounded, requires derivation from first principles, and is free of ambiguities or contradictions. Therefore, it is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe task is to derive the survival function $S(t)$, the probability density function $f(t)$, and the conditional survival probability $\\mathbb{P}(T  s + t \\mid T  s)$ for a continuous time-to-event random variable $T \\geq 0$ under the assumption of a constant hazard rate $h(t) = \\lambda  0$.\n\nLet us begin by relating the hazard function $h(t)$ to the survival function $S(t)$ and the probability density function $f(t)$ using the provided definitions.\n\nThe hazard function is defined as:\n$$h(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(t \\leq T  t + \\Delta t \\mid T \\geq t)}{\\Delta t}$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $\\mathbb{P}(A \\mid B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}$, we can rewrite the term in the limit:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(t \\leq T  t + \\Delta t \\mid T \\geq t) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}((t \\leq T  t + \\Delta t) \\cap (T \\geq t))}{\\mathbb{P}(T \\geq t)}$$\nThe event $\\{t \\leq T  t + \\Delta t\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{T \\geq t\\}$. Therefore, their intersection is simply $\\{t \\leq T  t + \\Delta t\\}$. The expression becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(t \\leq T  t + \\Delta t \\mid T \\geq t) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(t \\leq T  t + \\Delta t)}{\\mathbb{P}(T \\geq t)}$$\nThe denominator is the survival function, $S(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T  t)$. Since $T$ is a continuous random variable, $\\mathbb{P}(T=t) = 0$, so $\\mathbb{P}(T \\geq t) = \\mathbb{P}(T  t) = S(t)$. The numerator can be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T \\leq t)$, as $\\mathbb{P}(t \\leq T  t + \\Delta t) = F(t + \\Delta t) - F(t)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $h(t)$:\n$$h(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{F(t + \\Delta t) - F(t)}{\\Delta t} \\cdot \\frac{1}{S(t)}$$\nThe limit term is the definition of the derivative of the CDF, which is the probability density function (PDF), $f(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}F(t)$. Thus, we establish the fundamental relationship:\n$$h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$\nNext, we find a relationship between $S(t)$ and $f(t)$. The survival function is $S(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T  t) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T \\leq t) = 1 - F(t)$. Differentiating $S(t)$ with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}S(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(1 - F(t)) = - \\frac{d}{dt}F(t) = -f(t)$$\nNow, we can substitute $f(t) = -S'(t)$ into the expression for $h(t)$:\n$$h(t) = \\frac{-S'(t)}{S(t)} = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t))$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for $S(t)$. The problem states that the hazard rate is a constant, $h(t) = \\lambda$, for all $t \\geq 0$.\n$$\\lambda = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t))$$\nWe can solve this differential equation by integrating both sides with respect to time from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\\int_0^t \\lambda \\, du = -\\int_0^t \\frac{d}{du} \\ln(S(u)) \\, du$$\n$$\\lambda [u]_0^t = -[\\ln(S(u))]_0^t$$\n$$\\lambda t = -(\\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S(0)))$$\nThe initial condition $S(0)$ is the probability of survival beyond time $0$, which is $S(0) = \\mathbb{P}(T  0)$. Since $T$ is a non-negative continuous random variable representing time, $\\mathbb{P}(T \\geq 0) = 1$, and $\\mathbb{P}(T=0)=0$. Thus, $S(0) = \\mathbb{P}(T  0) = 1$. The natural logarithm of $S(0)$ is $\\ln(1) = 0$.\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$$\\lambda t = -\\ln(S(t))$$\nSolving for $S(t)$, we obtain the survival function:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNow, we derive the probability density function $f(t)$ using the relationship $f(t) = -S'(t)$:\n$$f(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} S(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$f(t) = -(-\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis is the second required expression, which is the PDF of the exponential distribution.\n\nFinally, we derive the conditional survival probability $\\mathbb{P}(T  s + t \\mid T  s)$ for $s \\geq 0$ and $t \\geq 0$. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(T  s + t \\mid T  s) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}((T  s + t) \\cap (T  s))}{\\mathbb{P}(T  s)}$$\nSince $s \\geq 0$ and $t \\geq 0$, the condition $T  s+t$ implies $T  s$.

This identity, $\\mathbb{P}(T  s + t \\mid T  s) = \\mathbb{P}(T  t)$, is known as the lack-of-memory property. It signifies that for an object whose lifetime follows an exponential distribution, the probability of surviving for an additional duration $t$ is independent of how long it has already survived ($s$). The system \"forgets\" its past. In the context of the clinical trial, a patient who has remained event-free for time $s$ has the same future survival prognosis as a new patient starting the trial.

The fundamental relationship between the survival function and the cumulative hazard function is given by:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp(-H(t))\n$$\nThis relationship arises from the definition of the hazard function. Specifically, $h(t) = f(t)/S(t)$, where $f(t) = -S'(t)$ is the probability density function. Thus, $h(t) = -S'(t)/S(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt}\\ln(S(t))$. Integrating from $0$ to $t$ gives $H(t) = \\int_0^t h(u)du = -\\ln(S(t))$, leading to $S(t) = \\exp(-H(t))$.\n\nSubstituting our derived expression for $H(t)$:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t^k)\n$$\nThis is the survival function for a Weibull distribution.\n\nNow, we derive the hazard function, $h(t)$. The hazard function is defined as the instantaneous rate of failure at time $t$, given survival up to time $t$. Mathematically, it is the derivative of the cumulative hazard function:\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} H(t)\n$$\nUsing our expression for $H(t) = \\lambda t^k$ and applying the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\lambda t^k) = \\lambda k t^{k-1}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the hazard function. The parameters $\\lambda  0$ and $k  0$ ensure that $h(t)  0$ for all $t  0$, as required for a hazard function.\n\nThe final part of the problem requires us to differentiate the hazard function to obtain $h'(t)$ and use its sign to characterize the failure rate. We differentiate $h(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\nh'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\lambda k t^{k-1})\n$$\nApplying the power rule again:\n$$\nh'(t) = \\lambda k (k-1) t^{k-2}\n$$\nTo determine whether the model exhibits an increasing failure rate (IFR) or decreasing failure rate (DFR), we examine the sign of $h'(t)$ for $t  0$. Since we are given that $\\lambda  0$ and $k  0$, and for $t  0$ the term $t^{k-2}$ is always positive, the sign of $h'(t)$ is determined solely by the sign of the term $(k-1)$.\n\n-   If $k  1$, then $(k-1)  0$, which implies $h'(t)  0$. This corresponds to an **Increasing Failure Rate (IFR)**. The risk of event occurrence increases with time.\n-   If $0  k  1$, then $(k-1)  0$, which implies $h'(t)  0$.

Since the causes are mutually exclusive, the event of failing in $[t, t+\\Delta t)$ is the disjoint union of failing from cause $1$ and failing from cause $2$. Thus, the overall hazard is the sum of the cause-specific hazards:\n        $$h_{\\text{all}}(t \\mid x) = h_1(t \\mid x) + h_2(t \\mid x)$$\n    -   The overall survival function, $S(t \\mid x)$, is the probability of not failing from any cause by time $t$, $P(T  t \\mid X=x)$. It is related to the overall hazard function by:\n        $$S(t \\mid x) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_0^t h_{\\text{all}}(u \\mid x) \\,du \\right)$$\n    -   The cumulative incidence function (CIF) for cause $j$, $F_j(t \\mid x)$, is the probability of failing from cause $j$ by time $t$: $F_j(t \\mid x) = P(T \\le t, C=j \\mid X=x)$.\n\n2.  **Derivation of the CIF from Definitions**:\n    The probability of failing from cause $j$ in an infinitesimal interval $[u, u+du)$ is the product of the probability of surviving up to time $u$ and the conditional probability of failing from cause $j$ in the interval, given survival. This gives the sub-distribution density $f_j(u \\mid x)$:\n    $$f_j(u \\mid x) = h_j(u \\mid x) S(u \\mid x)$$\n    The CIF is the integral of this sub-density from $0$ to $t$:\n    $$F_j(t \\mid x) = \\int_0^t f_j(u \\mid x) \\,du = \\int_0^t h_j(u \\mid x) S(u \\mid x) \\,du$$\n\n3.  **Applying the Specifics of the Problem**:\n    The given cause-specific hazards are constant with respect to time $t$:\n    $h_1(t \\mid x) = \\alpha_1 \\exp(\\beta_1 x)$\n    $h_2(t \\mid x) = \\alpha_2 \\exp(\\beta_2 x)$\n    \n    The overall hazard is therefore also constant in time:\n    $$h_{\\text{all}}(t \\mid x) = \\alpha_1 \\exp(\\beta_1 x) + \\alpha_2 \\exp(\\beta_2 x)$$\n    For notational simplicity, let's denote the time-constant hazards as $h_1(x)$, $h_2(x)$, and $h_{\\text{all}}(x)$. The integral in the survival function's exponent simplifies:\n    $$\\int_0^t h_{\\text{all}}(u \\mid x) \\,du = \\int_0^t h_{\\text{all}}(x) \\,du = t \\cdot h_{\\text{all}}(x)$$\n    So, the overall survival function is:\n    $$S(t \\mid x) = \\exp(-t \\cdot h_{\\text{all}}(x)) = \\exp\\left( -t \\left[ \\alpha_1 \\exp(\\beta_1 x) + \\alpha_2 \\exp(\\beta_2 x) \\right] \\right) $$\n\n4.  **Finalizing the CIF Expression for Cause 1**:\n    We now substitute these forms into the integral definition of $F_1(t \\mid x)$:\n    $$F_1(t \\mid x) = \\int_0^t h_1(u \\mid x) S(u \\mid x) \\,du = \\int_0^t h_1(x) \\exp(-u \\cdot h_{\\text{all}}(x)) \\,du$$\n    Since $h_1(x)$ and $h_{\\text{all}}(x)$ are constant with respect to the integration variable $u$, we can solve the integral:\n    $$F_1(t \\mid x) = h_1(x) \\int_0^t \\exp(-u \\cdot h_{\\text{all}}(x)) \\,du$$\n    $$F_1(t \\mid x) = h_1(x) \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-u \\cdot h_{\\text{all}}(x))}{-h_{\\text{all}}(x)} \\right]_0^t$$\n    $$F_1(t \\mid x) = h_1(x) \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-t \\cdot h_{\\text{all}}(x))}{-h_{\\text{all}}(x)} - \\frac{\\exp(0)}{-h_{\\text{all}}(x)} \\right)$$\n    $$F_1(t \\mid x) = h_1(x) \\left( \\frac{1 - \\exp(-t \\cdot h_{\\text{all}}(x))}{h_{\\text{all}}(x)} \\right)$$\n    This yields the final closed-form expression:\n    $$F_1(t \\mid x) = \\frac{h_1(x)}{h_{\\text{all}}(x)} \\left( 1 - S(t \\mid x) \\right)$$\n    Substituting the full parameter-dependent forms:\n    $$F_1(t \\mid x) = \\frac{\\alpha_1 \\exp(\\beta_1 x)}{\\alpha_1 \\exp(\\beta_1 x) + \\alpha_2 \\exp(\\beta_2 x)} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left( -t \\left[ \\alpha_1 \\exp(\\beta_1 x) + \\alpha_2 \\exp(\\beta_2 x) \\right] \\right) \\right)$$\n    This expression represents the probability of eventually failing from cause $1$, given that a failure occurs, multiplied by the probability of failing from any cause by time $t$.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe need to evaluate $F_1(t \\mid x)$ for $t=24$, $x=1$, $\\alpha_1=0.04$, $\\alpha_2=0.02$, $\\beta_1=0.8$, and $\\beta_2=-0.4$.\n\nFirst, calculate the cause-specific hazards for $x=1$:\n$$h_1(x=1) = 0.04 \\exp(0.8 \\cdot 1) = 0.04 \\exp(0.8)$$\n$$h_2(x=1) = 0.02 \\exp(-0.4 \\cdot 1) = 0.02 \\exp(-0.4)$$\n\nNext, calculate the overall hazard for $x=1$:\n$$h_{\\text{all}}(x=1) = h_1(x=1) + h_2(x=1) = 0.04 \\exp(0.8) + 0.02 \\exp(-0.4)$$\n\nNumerically:\n$h_1(x=1) \\approx 0.04 \\times 2.2255409 = 0.08902164$\n$h_2(x=1) \\approx 0.02 \\times 0.6703200 = 0.01340640$\n$h_{\\text{all}}(x=1) \\approx 0.08902164 + 0.01340640 = 0.10242804$\n\nNow, substitute these into the CIF formula with $t=24$:\n$$F_1(24 \\mid 1) = \\frac{h_1(x=1)}{h_{\\text{all}}(x=1)} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left( -24 \\cdot h_{\\text{all}}(x=1) \\right) \\right)$$\n$$F_1(24 \\mid 1) \\approx \\frac{0.08902164}{0.10242804} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left( -24 \\cdot 0.10242804 \\right) \\right)$$\n$$F_1(24 \\mid 1) \\approx 0.8691206 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left( -2.45827296 \\right) \\right)$$\n$$F_1(24 \\mid 1) \\approx 0.8691206 \\left( 1 - 0.0855835 \\right)$$\n$$F_1(24 \\mid 1) \\approx 0.8691206 \\times 0.9144165 \\approx 0.794716$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the value is $0.7947$.\n\n### Interpretational Pitfalls of Cause-Specific Hazards\n\n1.  **Confounding Hazard Ratios with Risk Ratios**: A primary pitfall is to interpret the ratio of cause-specific hazards directly as a ratio of cumulative risks. For instance, if a covariate doubles the cause-specific hazard for cause $1$ (i.e., a hazard ratio of $2.0$), it does not imply that the probability of experiencing event $1$ by time $t$ (the CIF) is doubled. The CIF, $F_1(t \\mid x) = \\int_0^t h_1(u \\mid x) S(u \\mid x) du$, depends on both $h_1(u \\mid x)$ and the overall survival $S(u \\mid x)$. The overall survival is determined by the sum of all cause-specific hazards, $h_{\\text{all}}(u \\mid x) = h_1(u \\mid x) + h_2(u \\mid x) + \\dots$. If a covariate increases $h_1(u \\mid x)$, it also increases $h_{\\text{all}}(u \\mid x)$, which in turn decreases the overall survival probability $S(u \\mid x)$ for all $u  0$. Therefore, the integral for $F_1(t \\mid x)$ involves a higher hazard but is integrated over a shorter effective time span because fewer subjects remain at risk. The net effect on the cumulative probability $F_1(t \\mid x)$ is not straightforward and is generally not proportional to the change in the hazard.\n\n2.  **The \"Independent Risks\" Fallacy and Misuse of Kaplan-Meier Estimation**: Another common pitfall is to analyze the risk of one cause by treating failures from competing causes as simple non-informative censoring. This approach implicitly invokes a hypothetical world where the competing risks are eliminated. The resulting estimate, typically from a Kaplan-Meier estimator, $1 - S_{KM, j}(t)$, does not represent the actual probability of failure from cause $j$, $F_j(t)$, in the real world where all risks are present. The Kaplan-Meier estimate answers a different, often clinically irrelevant, question about the risk of cause $j$ *if it were the only possible cause of failure*. This quantity, $1 - S_{KM, j}(t)$, is always greater than or equal to the true CIF, $F_j(t)$. Summing these quantities across all causes, $\\sum_j (1 - S_{KM, j}(t))$, can yield a total probability greater than $1$, which is nonsensical. The correct measure for the probability of an event in the presence of competing risks is the cumulative incidence function.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.7947}\n$$", "id": "3186957"}]}
