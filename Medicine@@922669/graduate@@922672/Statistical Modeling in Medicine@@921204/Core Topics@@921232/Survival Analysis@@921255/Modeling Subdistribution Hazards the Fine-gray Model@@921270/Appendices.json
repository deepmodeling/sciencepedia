Unlike cause-specific models that censor individuals at the time of a competing event, the Fine-Gray approach retains these individuals in the risk set. This exercise ([@problem_id:4975273]) provides a concrete, step-by-step application of this principle, challenging you to manually construct the subdistribution risk set for a small cohort and thereby build a foundational intuition for how the model operates.", "problem": "Consider a competing risks setting in a medical follow-up study with two causes of failure: cause $1$ is the event of interest (for example, cardiovascular death), and cause $2$ is a competing event (for example, non-cardiovascular death). Let $T$ denote the true event time, $J \\in \\{1,2\\}$ the true cause indicator when an event occurs, and $C$ the censoring time. The observed time is $X = \\min(T,C)$, with an observed event indicator $D = I\\{T \\leq C\\}$ and an observed cause $J$ recorded only if $D=1$.\n\nThe subdistribution hazard for cause $1$ (the Fine–Gray model) is defined in terms of the cumulative incidence function (CIF) for cause $1$, $F_{1}(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T \\leq t, J=1)$, by the hazard corresponding to the failure-from-cause-$1$ process among those who have not yet failed from cause $1$. In the counting process representation, the intensity for the cause-$1$ failure process $N_{1}(t) = I\\{T \\leq t, J=1\\}$ uses an at-risk indicator $Y^{*}(t)$ that encodes membership in the subdistribution risk set, which, by conceptual design, contains all individuals who have not yet experienced cause $1$ by time $t$ (including those who experienced a competing cause before $t$). Under censoring, the observed at-risk indicator truncates membership at $C$.\n\nStarting from these core definitions, derive the observed subdistribution at-risk indicator $Y^{*}_{i,\\mathrm{obs}}(t)$ for individual $i$ at time $t$ in terms of $T_{i}$, $J_{i}$, and $C_{i}$, and then apply your result to the following hypothetical dataset of five subjects, with times in months:\n- Subject $1$: experienced the event of interest at $T_{1}=5$, administratively censored at $C_{1}=12$.\n- Subject $2$: experienced the competing event at $T_{2}=4$, administratively censored at $C_{2}=12$.\n- Subject $3$: no event before censoring at $C_{3}=7$.\n- Subject $4$: no event before censoring at $C_{4}=6$.\n- Subject $5$: no event before censoring at $C_{5}=9$.\n\nFor cause $1$, compute the entries of the indicator $Y^{*}_{i,\\mathrm{obs}}(t)$ at the selected times $t \\in \\{3,6,9\\}$.

All definitions and data required for the solution are provided and are scientifically sound and consistent.\n\nThe first step is to derive a formal expression for the observed subdistribution at-risk indicator, $Y^{*}_{i,\\mathrm{obs}}(t)$, for an individual $i$ at time $t$. The problem states that the subdistribution risk set at time $t$ for cause $1$ \"contains all individuals who have not yet experienced cause $1$ by time $t$ (including those who experienced a competing cause before $t$)\" and that observation is truncated by censoring.\n\nWe use the observed data for subject $i$: the observed time $X_i = \\min(T_i, C_i)$, the event indicator $D_i = I\\{T_i \\leq C_i\\}$, and, if an event occurs ($D_i=1$), the cause $J_i$.\n\nAn individual $i$ is in the observed subdistribution risk set at time $t$ if one of two mutually exclusive conditions is met:\n$1$. The individual has not experienced any event and has not been censored up to time $t$. This means their observed follow-up time is greater than or equal to $t$. This condition is expressed as $X_i \\geq t$.\n$2$. The individual experienced a competing event (cause $2$) at a time $X_i$ prior to $t$. According to the Fine-Gray model, such individuals are considered \"immortal\" with respect to cause $1$ and remain in the risk set. This condition is expressed as $X_i < t$ and $D_i=1$ and $J_i=2$.\n\nIf an individual experiences the event of interest (cause $1$) at $X_i < t$, they are removed from the risk set. If an individual is censored at $X_i < t$ (meaning $D_i=0$), they are also removed from the risk set as they are no longer under observation.\n\nCombining these conditions, the at-risk indicator $Y^{*}_{i,\\mathrm{obs}}(t)$ is $1$ if the individual is in the risk set and $0$ otherwise. Using the indicator function $I(\\cdot)$, we can write the formal expression:\n$$\nY^{*}_{i,\\mathrm{obs}}(t) = I\\{ (X_i \\geq t) \\lor (X_i < t \\land D_i=1 \\land J_i=2) \\}\n$$\nSince the two conditions in the disjunction are mutually exclusive on $X_i$, we can also write this as:\n$$\nY^{*}_{i,\\mathrm{obs}}(t) = I\\{X_i \\geq t\\} + I\\{X_i < t \\land D_i=1 \\land J_i=2\\}\n$$\nThis expression formalizes the logic of the Fine-Gray risk set.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to the provided dataset.

It is scientifically grounded in the established statistical theory of competing risks survival analysis, specifically the Fine-Gray model. It is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, constants, and data to compute the requested quantity. The language is objective and precise, and the setup is internally consistent and free from logical flaws.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the relationship between the cumulative incidence function (CIF) for a specific cause of failure and the corresponding subdistribution hazard. In a competing risks setting, the CIF for cause $k$, denoted $F_k(t \\mid X)$, gives the probability that an individual with covariate vector $X$ will have experienced an event of type $k$ by time $t$. It is defined as $F_k(t \\mid X) = P(T \\le t, \\text{Event Type} = k \\mid X)$, where $T$ is the time to the first event.\n\nThe Fine-Gray model directly models the subdistribution hazard, $\\tilde{\\lambda}_k(t \\mid X)$, which is the instantaneous rate of occurrence of an event of type $k$ in subjects who are still at risk for this event. The \"at-risk\" group for the subdistribution hazard includes not only those who have not yet experienced any event, but also those who have already experienced a competing event. The relationship between the CIF and the cumulative subdistribution hazard, $\\tilde{H}_k(t \\mid X) = \\int_0^t \\tilde{\\lambda}_k(u \\mid X) du$, is analogous to the relationship between the survivor function and the cumulative hazard in standard survival analysis:\n$$ F_k(t \\mid X) = 1 - \\exp(-\\tilde{H}_k(t \\mid X)) $$\n\nThe Proportional Subdistribution Hazards (PSH) model, as specified, assumes a proportional relationship between the subdistribution hazard for an individual and a baseline subdistribution hazard, $\\tilde{\\lambda}_{0k}(t)$. The model is specified as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\lambda}_k(t \\mid X) = \\tilde{\\lambda}_{0k}(t) \\exp(X^{\\top}\\beta_k) $$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to time from $0$ to $t$ yields the relationship for the cumulative subdistribution hazards:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_k(t \\mid X) = \\int_0^t \\tilde{\\lambda}_{0k}(u) \\exp(X^{\\top}\\beta_k) du = \\left(\\int_0^t \\tilde{\\lambda}_{0k}(u) du\\right) \\exp(X^{\\top}\\beta_k) $$\n$$ \\tilde{H}_k(t \\mid X) = \\tilde{H}_{0k}(t) \\exp(X^{\\top}\\beta_k) $$\nHere, $\\tilde{H}_{0k}(t)$ is the baseline cumulative subdistribution hazard for cause $k$.\n\nSubstituting this model-based expression for $\\tilde{H}_k(t \\mid X)$ into the CIF formula gives the predictive form for the Fine-Gray model:\n$$ F_k(t \\mid X) = 1 - \\exp(-\\tilde{H}_{0k}(t) \\exp(X^{\\top}\\beta_k)) $$\nUsing the provided estimates, denoted with a hat ($\\hat{\\cdot}$), we have the predictive equation:\n$$ \\hat{F}_k(t \\mid X) = 1 - \\exp(-\\hat{\\tilde{H}}_{0k}(t) \\exp(X^{\\top}\\hat{\\beta}_k)) $$\n\nWe are asked to calculate $\\hat{F}_k(3 \\text{ years} \\mid X)$ for a patient with covariates $X = (X_1, X_2)^{\\top} = (1.2, 1)^{\\top}$.

Let cause $k$ denote cancer-specific death, and let cause $c$ denote non-cancer death (for example, cardiovascular death). Define the following fundamental quantities: the cause-specific hazard for cause $k$ at time $t$, $\\lambda_k(t)$; the cause-specific hazard for the competing cause $c$, $\\lambda_c(t)$; the overall survival function under competing risks, $S(t)$, which is the probability of being event-free from any cause up to time $t$; the cumulative incidence function for cause $k$, $F_k(t)$, which is the probability of failing from cause $k$ by time $t$; and the Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard for cause $k$, $h_k(t)$, defined by the limit\n$$\nh_k(t) \\equiv \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{\\mathbb{P}\\big(t < T \\le t + \\Delta t,\\ K = k \\,\\big|\\, T \\ge t \\text{ or } (T < t \\text{ and } K \\ne k)\\big)}{\\Delta t}.\n$$\nYou may assume constant cause-specific hazards within each group, leading to an overall survival $S(t)$ that is non-increasing in $t$ and a cumulative incidence $F_k(t)$ that is non-decreasing in $t$, and that all relationships invoked in the solution follow from these core definitions and standard properties of competing risks quantities.\n\nSuppose there are two exposure groups: unexposed ($U$) and exposed ($E$). In group $U$, the cause-specific hazards are constant over time with $\\lambda_k^U(t) \\equiv \\lambda_k^U = 0.02$ per year and $\\lambda_c^U(t) \\equiv \\lambda_c^U = 0.01$ per year. In group $E$, a covariate (for example, a new cardiotoxic therapy) changes both hazards to $\\lambda_k^E(t) \\equiv \\lambda_k^E = 0.03$ per year and $\\lambda_c^E(t) \\equiv \\lambda_c^E = 0.50$ per year.\n\nWhich option best describes a scientifically coherent scenario in which the covariate increases the subdistribution hazard $h_k(t)$ at an early time but decreases the cumulative incidence $F_k(t)$ by a clinically relevant horizon time (for example, $t = 5$ years), due to large increases in other-cause hazards, and correctly states the epidemiologic implications?\n\nA. At $t = 0.2$ years, $h_k^E(t) > h_k^U(t)$, yet by $t = 5$ years $F_k^E(t) < F_k^U(t)$, because the very large $\\lambda_c^E$ causes a rapid depletion of the event-free population, reducing the accumulation of cancer deaths despite a higher instantaneous subdistribution hazard for cancer death. The epidemiologic implication is that a covariate can raise the Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard for cause $k$ while lowering the cumulative incidence of cause $k$ by diverting failures to competing causes; therefore, interpreting a larger $h_k(t)$ as a larger absolute risk for cause $k$ without considering competing risks can be misleading for policy and clinical decisions.\n\nB. It is impossible for $h_k(t)$ to increase while $F_k(t)$ decreases at any fixed $t$; under the Fine–Gray model, a higher subdistribution hazard necessarily yields a higher cumulative incidence for cause $k$, regardless of the behavior of other causes.\n\nC. In the Fine–Gray model, increasing $\\lambda_c(t)$ does not affect $h_k(t)$ because subjects who fail from competing causes are removed from the risk set; therefore, $F_k(t)$ can only increase when $h_k(t)$ increases.\n\nD. If the subdistribution hazard ratio for cause $k$ exceeds $1$, it necessarily means the covariate increases both the cause-specific hazard $\\lambda_k(t)$ and the cumulative incidence $F_k(t)$ for cause $k$; otherwise, the model assumptions are violated.\n\nE.

The Fine-Gray model is a canonical method for analyzing such data. The setup is a classic textbook example used to illustrate the interpretation of different risk measures. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: All necessary parameters (constant hazard rates for both causes in both groups) are provided to calculate the quantities of interest, $F_k(t)$ and $h_k(t)$. The question is specific and asks to identify the correct description and implication of a particular, calculable outcome. A unique and meaningful answer can be derived.

There is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is free from the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is not incomplete, contradictory, or unrealistic in a way that invalidates the statistical point being made. While a hazard rate of $0.50$ is very high, it is not physically impossible, particularly in a scenario involving a highly cardiotoxic therapy in advanced cancer patients, and serves to make the mathematical point clear. The problem is not trivial; it addresses a subtle and often misunderstood concept in competing risks.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the subdistribution hazard $h_k(t)$ and the cumulative incidence function (CIF) $F_k(t)$ between the exposed ($E$) and unexposed ($U$) groups. We are given constant cause-specific hazards.\n\n**1. Fundamental Relationships**\nThe overall hazard is the sum of the cause-specific hazards: $\\lambda(t) = \\lambda_k(t) + \\lambda_c(t)$. Since the cause-specific hazards are constant, the overall hazard is also constant for each group.\n- Group $U$: $\\lambda^U = \\lambda_k^U + \\lambda_c^U = 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.03$.\n- Group $E$: $\\lambda^E = \\lambda_k^E + \\lambda_c^E = 0.03 + 0.50 = 0.53$.\n\nThe overall survival function is $S(t) = \\exp(-\\int_0^t \\lambda(u) du) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\n\nThe cumulative incidence function for cause $k$, $F_k(t)$, is the probability of failing from cause $k$ by time $t$. It is calculated by integrating the cause-specific hazard for $k$ weighted by the overall survival:\n$$F_k(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) S(u) du = \\int_0^t \\lambda_k e^{-\\lambda u} du = \\lambda_k \\left[ \\frac{-e^{-\\lambda u}}{\\lambda} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\lambda} (1 - e^{-\\lambda t})$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = \\lambda_k + \\lambda_c$, we get:\n$$F_k(t) = \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\lambda_k + \\lambda_c} \\left(1 - e^{-(\\lambda_k + \\lambda_c)t}\\right)$$\n\nThe subdistribution hazard for cause $k$, $h_k(t)$, is related to the CIF by $h_k(t) = \\frac{d/dt F_k(t)}{1 - F_k(t)}$.\nThe derivative of the CIF is the subdistribution density, $f_k(t) = d/dt F_k(t) = \\lambda_k e^{-(\\lambda_k + \\lambda_c)t} = \\lambda_k S(t)$.\nSo, $h_k(t) = \\frac{\\lambda_k S(t)}{1 - F_k(t)}$.

Calculations for the Two Groups**\n\n**Cumulative Incidence at $t=5$ years:**\n- **Group U:**\n$$F_k^U(5) = \\frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.01} \\left(1 - e^{-(0.02 + 0.01) \\times 5}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\left(1 - e^{-0.15}\\right)$$\nUsing $e^{-0.15} \\approx 0.8607$, we get:\n$$F_k^U(5) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} (1 - 0.8607) = \\frac{2}{3}(0.1393) \\approx 0.0929$$\nThe 5-year cumulative incidence of cancer death in the unexposed group is approximately $9.3\\%$.\n\n- **Group E:**\n$$F_k^E(5) = \\frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.50} \\left(1 - e^{-(0.03 + 0.50) \\times 5}\\right) = \\frac{3}{53} \\left(1 - e^{-2.65}\\right)$$\nUsing $e^{-2.65} \\approx 0.0707$, we get:\n$$F_k^E(5) \\approx \\frac{3}{53} (1 - 0.0707) = \\frac{3}{53}(0.9293) \\approx 0.0526$$\nThe 5-year cumulative incidence of cancer death in the exposed group is approximately $5.3\\%$.\n\nComparing the two, we find that $F_k^E(5) < F_k^U(5)$.\n\n**Subdistribution Hazard at an early time (e.g., $t \\to 0$ or $t=0.2$ years):**\n- As established, for small $t$, $h_k(t) \\approx \\lambda_k(t)$.\n- For Group U: $h_k^U(t \\to 0) = \\lambda_k^U = 0.02$.\n- For Group E: $h_k^E(t \\to 0) = \\lambda_k^E = 0.03$.\n\nSo, at early time points, $h_k^E(t) > h_k^U(t)$. For instance, the ratio of subdistribution hazards at $t=0$ is $h_k^E(0)/h_k^U(0) = 0.03/0.02 = 1.5$. This confirms that the exposure increases the initial subdistribution hazard.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\nThe calculations confirm the scenario posed: the exposure is associated with a higher subdistribution hazard for cancer death at early times ($h_k^E(t) > h_k^U(t)$) but a lower cumulative incidence of cancer death by $t=5$ years ($F_k^E(5) < F_k^U(5)$). This occurs because the massive increase in the competing hazard $\\lambda_c^E$ leads to a rapid removal of subjects from the at-risk population in the exposed group, preventing many of them from surviving long enough to die from cancer, despite their higher underlying cancer-specific hazard rate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At $t = 0.2$ years, $h_k^E(t) > h_k^U(t)$, yet by $t = 5$ years $F_k^E(t) < F_k^U(t)$, because the very large $\\lambda_c^E$ causes a rapid depletion of the event-free population, reducing the accumulation of cancer deaths despite a higher instantaneous subdistribution hazard for cancer death. The epidemiologic implication is that a covariate can raise the Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard for cause $k$ while lowering the cumulative incidence of cause $k$ by diverting failures to competing causes; therefore, interpreting a larger $h_k(t)$ as a larger absolute risk for cause $k$ without considering competing risks can be misleading for policy and clinical decisions.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option accurately states the numerical results we derived ($h_k$ is higher early on, $F_k$ is lower by year $5$). The explanation provided—\"rapid depletion of the event-free population\" due to a large $\\lambda_c^E$—is the correct mechanism. The epidemiologic implication is also stated correctly and is a cornerstone of interpreting competing risks analyses: a hazard ratio (whether for cause-specific or subdistribution hazards) is a relative measure of instantaneous risk and does not directly translate to absolute risk (cumulative incidence) in the presence of strong competing risks.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. It is impossible for $h_k(t)$ to increase while $F_k(t)$ decreases at any fixed $t$; under the Fine–Gray model, a higher subdistribution hazard necessarily yields a higher cumulative incidence for cause $k$, regardless of the behavior of other causes.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement is false. Our calculations provide a direct counterexample. The relationship between the subdistribution hazard $h_k(t)$ and the CIF $F_k(t)$ is $F_k(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\int_0^t h_k(u) du)$. For $F_k^E(t)$ to be greater than $F_k^U(t)$, it is necessary that $\\int_0^t h_k^E(u) du > \\int_0^t h_k^U(u) du$. This requires $h_k^E(u)$ to be greater than $h_k^U(u)$ \"on average\" over the interval $[0, t]$. However, our problem shows that the subdistribution hazard ratio can cross from above $1$ to below $1$, allowing the CIF curves to cross as well. This option claims impossibility for a phenomenon we have just demonstrated.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In the Fine–Gray model, increasing $\\lambda_c(t)$ does not affect $h_k(t)$ because subjects who fail from competing causes are removed from the risk set; therefore, $F_k(t)$ can only increase when $h_k(t)$ increases.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option contains a fundamental error. It incorrectly describes the risk set for the subdistribution hazard. The definition of $h_k(t)$ given in the problem explicitly includes individuals who have failed from a competing cause (`T < t and K != k`) in the \"at-risk\" population (the denominator of the conditional probability). This is the key distinction from the cause-specific hazard, which censors such individuals. Because the risk set for $h_k(t)$ includes these individuals, $h_k(t)$ is absolutely affected by the rate of competing events, $\\lambda_c(t)$. The formula we derived for $h_k(t)$ clearly shows its dependence on $\\lambda_c$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If the subdistribution hazard ratio for cause $k$ exceeds $1$, it necessarily means the covariate increases both the cause-specific hazard $\\lambda_k(t)$ and the cumulative incidence $F_k(t)$ for cause $k$; otherwise, the model assumptions are violated.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option makes two claims. First, that a subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) $> 1$ implies an increase in $\\lambda_k(t)$. At $t=0$, $SHR(0) = \\lambda_k^E/\\lambda_k^U$, so an initial SHR $>1$ does imply an initial cause-specific hazard ratio $>1$. However, the second claim is that it *necessarily* means an increase in the cumulative incidence $F_k(t)$. Our calculations show this is false: we have an initial $SHR > 1$ but $F_k^E(5) < F_k^U(5)$. This is a valid result of competing risks dynamics, not a violation of model assumptions.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Observing $h_k(t)$ increase while $F_k(t)$ decreases necessarily indicates confounding by an unmeasured comorbidity; after proper adjustment this pattern cannot occur.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option incorrectly attributes a fundamental statistical property of competing risks to confounding. The phenomenon observed is a direct mathematical consequence of the interplay between the cause-specific hazards, even in a perfectly specified, unconfounded model as given in the problem. The effect is driven by the specified hazard rates themselves, not by an unmeasured variable. The pattern is a feature of competing risks scenarios, not an artifact to be \"adjusted away\".\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4975165"}]}
