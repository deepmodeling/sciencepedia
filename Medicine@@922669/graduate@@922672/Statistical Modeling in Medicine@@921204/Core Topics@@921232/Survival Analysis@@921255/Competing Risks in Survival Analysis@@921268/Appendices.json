This bias is the difference between the naively computed incidence ($1 - \\hat{S}_{KM}(5)$) and the correctly computed cumulative incidence function ($\\hat{F}_{1}(5)$).\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of $1 - \\hat{S}_{KM}(5)$**\n\nIn this approach, events from cause $1$ are considered the event of interest, and events from cause $2$ are treated as independent censoring. The Kaplan-Meier estimator for the \"survival\" function (i.e., freedom from cause 1 death) is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{S}_{KM}(t) = \\prod_{t_j \\leq t} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_{1,j}}{n_j}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $t_j$ are the event times for cause $1$, $d_{1,j}$ is the number of cause $1$ events at $t_j$, and $n_j$ is the number of patients at risk just before $t_j$.\n\nLet's construct the life table for this analysis.\n-   At $t=0$, the initial number of patients at risk is $n_0 = 10$.\n-   At the first event time, $t=2$:\n    -   The number of patients at risk is $n_2 = 10$.\n    -   The number of events of interest (cause $1$) is $d_{1,2} = 2$.\n    -   The number of patients experiencing the competing event (cause $2$), treated here as censored, is $d_{2,2} = 4$.\n    -   The survival probability past this time point is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\hat{S}_{KM}(2) = \\left(1 - \\frac{d_{1,2}}{n_2}\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{10}\\right) = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8\n    $$\n-   For the next interval, we determine the number of patients still at risk. These are the patients who did not have an event of either cause at $t=2$.\n    -   Number at risk at $t=4$: $n_4 = n_2 - d_{1,2} - d_{2,2} = 10 - 2 - 4 = 4$.\n-   At the second event time, $t=4$:\n    -   The number of patients at risk is $n_4 = 4$.\n    -   The number of events of interest (cause $1$) is $d_{1,4} = 2$.\n    -   The cumulative survival probability is updated:\n    $$\n    \\hat{S}_{KM}(4) = \\hat{S}_{KM}(2) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{d_{1,4}}{n_4}\\right) = 0.8 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{4}\\right) = 0.8 \\times 0.5 = 0.4\n    $$\n-   At the analysis horizon, $t=5$:\n    -   No events occur between $t=4$ and $t=5$. The remaining $n_4 - d_{1,4} - d_{2,4} = 4 - 2 - 0 = 2$ patients are administratively censored at $t=5$. This does not change the survival estimate.\n    -   Therefore, $\\hat{S}_{KM}(5) = \\hat{S}_{KM}(4) = 0.4$.\n\nThe complement of the Kaplan-Meier estimate is:\n$$\n1 - \\hat{S}_{KM}(5) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6\n$$\nThis value represents an estimate of the incidence of cause $1$ under the flawed assumption of independent censoring.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Cumulative Incidence Function $F_1(5)$**\n\nThe cumulative incidence function (CIF) correctly accounts for competing risks by considering the probability of failing from a specific cause in the presence of all other causes. The estimator for the CIF for cause $k$ is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{F}_k(t) = \\sum_{t_j \\leq t} \\frac{d_{k,j}}{n_j} \\hat{S}(t_{j-1})\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{S}(t)$ is the **overall** survival function, which considers events from all causes.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the overall survival function, $\\hat{S}(t)$.\n$$\n\\hat{S}(t) = \\prod_{t_j \\leq t} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_j}{n_j}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $d_j = d_{1,j} + d_{2,j}$ is the total number of events at time $t_j$.\n-   At $t=0$, $\\hat{S}(0) = 1$. The number at risk is $n_0 = 10$.\n-   At $t=2$:\n    -   The number at risk is $n_2 = 10$.\n    -   The total number of events is $d_2 = d_{1,2} + d_{2,2} = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n    -   The overall survival probability is:\n    $$\n    \\hat{S}(2) = \\hat{S}(0) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{d_2}{n_2}\\right) = 1 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{6}{10}\\right) = 0.4\n    $$\n-   At $t=4$:\n    -   The number at risk is $n_4 = n_2 - d_2 = 10 - 6 = 4$.\n    -   The total number of events is $d_4 = d_{1,4} + d_{2,4} = 2 + 0 = 2$.\n    -   The overall survival probability is updated:\n    $$\n    \\hat{S}(4) = \\hat{S}(2) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{d_4}{n_4}\\right) = 0.4 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{4}\\right) = 0.4 \\times 0.5 = 0.2\n    $$\n-   As no further events occur before $t=5$, $\\hat{S}(5) = \\hat{S}(4) = 0.2$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the CIF for cause $1$, $\\hat{F}_1(5)$. This involves summing the increments at each event time where cause $1$ events occurred.\n-   Increment at $t=2$: This is the probability of failing from cause $1$ at $t=2$, which is the cause-specific hazard multiplied by the survival probability just before $t=2$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Increment}_1 = \\frac{d_{1,2}}{n_2} \\hat{S}(0) = \\frac{2}{10} \\times 1 = 0.2\n    $$\n-   Increment at $t=4$: This is the probability of failing from cause $1$ at $t=4$, given survival until just before $t=4$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Increment}_2 = \\frac{d_{1,4}}{n_4} \\hat{S}(2) = \\frac{2}{4} \\times 0.4 = 0.5 \\times 0.4 = 0.2\n    $$\n-   The cumulative incidence for cause $1$ at $t=5$ is the sum of these increments, as no cause $1$ events occur after $t=4$.\n    $$\n    \\hat{F}_1(5) = \\text{Increment}_1 + \\text{Increment}_2 = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4\n    $$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Bias**\n\nThe bias is the difference between the incidence estimated by the naive Kaplan-Meier method and the incidence estimated by the proper competing risks CIF method.\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\left(1 - \\hat{S}_{KM}(5)\\right) - \\hat{F}_{1}(5)\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2\n$$\nThe positive bias of $0.2$ indicates that treating competing events as censoring leads to an overestimation of the probability of the event of interest.

This phenomenon is a key feature of competing risks.\nThe CIF is influenced by both the cause-specific hazard for the event of interest ($\\lambda_1$) and the overall survival ($S_{all}$), which is determined by the hazard from all competing causes ($\\lambda_{all}$).\nIn the exposed group, the therapy increases the cause $1$ hazard by a factor of $1.2$. However, it increases the cause $2$ (other-cause death) hazard by a much larger factor of $25$. This dramatic increase in the hazard for cause $2$ leads to a very high overall hazard ($\\lambda_{all}(1) = 0.536$) compared to the unexposed group ($\\lambda_{all}(0) = 0.05$). Consequently, the overall survival function for the exposed, $S(t \\mid X=1) = \\exp(-0.536t)$, decreases much more rapidly than for the unexposed, $S(t \\mid X=0) = \\exp(-0.05t)$. Patients in the exposed group are at a very high risk of dying from cause $2$, meaning they are removed from the at-risk population so quickly that they have less opportunity to experience an event from cause $1$, despite the slightly elevated hazard for that cause.\nThe probability of cause $1$ ultimately depends on the proportion $\\frac{\\lambda_1(X)}{\\lambda_{all}(X)}$. For the unexposed, this is $\\frac{0.03}{0.05}=0.6$. For the exposed, it is $\\frac{0.036}{0.536} \\approx 0.067$. Even though the exposed group experiences events more quickly (the term $(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{all}t))$ approaches its asymptote faster), the fact that only about $6.7\\%$ of these events are from cause $1$ (versus $60\\%$ in the unexposed) leads to a much lower cumulative incidence for cause $1$ across the clinically relevant time frame.\n\nTo formally demonstrate this for $t \\in [1, 36]$, consider the function $g(t) = F_1(t \\mid X=0) - F_1(t \\mid X=1)$. We must show $g(t) > 0$ for $t \\in [1, 36]$.\nAt $t=1$:\n$F_1(1 \\mid 0) = 0.6(1 - \\exp(-0.05)) \\approx 0.02928$\n$F_1(1 \\mid 1) = \\frac{0.036}{0.536}(1 - \\exp(-0.536)) \\approx 0.02787$\n$g(1) \\approx 0.00141 > 0$.\nThe derivative is $g'(t) = 0.03\\exp(-0.05t) - 0.036\\exp(-0.536t)$. Setting $g'(t)=0$ yields $t = \\frac{\\ln(1.2)}{0.486} \\approx 0.375$. For $t > 0.375$, $g'(t) > 0$, so $g(t)$ is increasing on $[1, 36]$. Since $g(1) > 0$ and $g(t)$ is increasing, $g(t) > 0$ for all $t \\in [1, 36]$, which confirms that $F_1(t \\mid X=1)  F_1(t \\mid X=0)$ on this interval.\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta = F_1(18 \\mid X=1) - F_1(18 \\mid X=0)$ at $t=18$ months.\n$F_1(18 \\mid X=0) = 0.6(1 - \\exp(-0.05 \\times 18)) = 0.6(1 - \\exp(-0.9))$\n$F_1(18 \\mid X=1) = \\frac{0.036}{0.536}(1 - \\exp(-0.536 \\times 18)) = \\frac{0.036}{0.536}(1 - \\exp(-9.648))$\n\nNow we calculate the numerical values:\n$F_1(18 \\mid X=0) \\approx 0.6(1 - 0.40656966) = 0.6(0.59343034) \\approx 0.35605820$\n$F_1(18 \\mid X=1) \\approx \\frac{0.036}{0.536}(1 - 0.00006456) = (0.06716418)(0.99993544) \\approx 0.06715984$\n\nThe difference is:\n$\\Delta = F_1(18 \\mid X=1) - F_1(18 \\mid X=0) \\approx 0.06715984 - 0.35605820 \\approx -0.28889836$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta = -0.2889$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.2889}\n$$", "id": "4956518"}]}
