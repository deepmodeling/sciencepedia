## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles and mechanics of the cumulative incidence function (CIF). We have defined the CIF as the probability of experiencing a specific type of event by a certain time in the presence of competing events, and we have explored its nonparametric estimation via the Aalen–Johansen method. This chapter shifts our focus from theory to practice, exploring how the CIF is utilized, modeled, and interpreted across a wide array of scientific disciplines, particularly in medicine, epidemiology, and public health. Our goal is not to reteach the core concepts, but to demonstrate their utility, extension, and integration in applied settings where accurately quantifying absolute risk is paramount. We will see how the CIF serves as the foundational quantity for prognostic modeling, [model evaluation](@entry_id:164873), causal inference, and ethical reporting in the complex landscape of competing risks.

### Modeling and Estimation of the Cumulative Incidence Function

While the Aalen–Johansen estimator provides a robust nonparametric estimate of the CIF, researchers often seek to understand how covariates influence the risk of an event. This requires regression modeling. There are two primary strategies for modeling the CIF: an indirect approach based on cause-specific hazards and a direct approach based on the subdistribution hazard.

#### The Relationship between Cause-Specific Hazards and Cumulative Incidence

The most established approach to modeling competing risks data involves fitting a separate model for each cause-specific hazard, $\lambda_k(t \mid X)$. Typically, a Cox [proportional hazards model](@entry_id:171806) is specified for each of the $K$ event types. The results from these $K$ separate models can then be combined to construct the CIF for any cause $k$. This is possible due to the fundamental relationship:

$F_k(t \mid X) = \int_0^t S(u \mid X) \lambda_k(u \mid X) \,du$

Here, $S(t \mid X) = \exp(-\int_0^t \sum_{j=1}^K \lambda_j(u \mid X) \,du)$ is the overall event-free [survival function](@entry_id:267383), which itself depends on the hazards of all competing events. By fitting models for each $\lambda_j(t \mid X)$, one can construct an estimate for $S(t \mid X)$ and subsequently integrate to find the CIF for the cause of interest, $k$. This method is powerful because it dissects the process into its etiological components; the covariates' effects on each cause-specific hazard can be interpreted as their influence on the instantaneous rate of a particular event among those still at risk for any event [@problem_id:4987837].

However, this indirect approach can be cumbersome for prediction. The final expression for $F_k(t \mid X)$ does not have a simple closed form in terms of the [regression coefficients](@entry_id:634860) from the cause-specific models, making it difficult to directly quantify a covariate's effect on the cumulative incidence itself. This has motivated the development of methods for directly modeling the CIF.

#### Direct Modeling of the Cumulative Incidence Function

Direct modeling of the CIF provides a framework where [regression coefficients](@entry_id:634860) have a more direct interpretation in terms of the absolute risk of an event.

The most prominent method for direct modeling is the Proportional Subdistribution Hazards (PSH) model, introduced by Fine and Gray. This model is based on the subdistribution hazard, $\lambda_k^*(t \mid X)$, which is the instantaneous rate of a type-$k$ event among individuals who have not yet experienced an event of type $k$. A crucial and unique feature of this model is its definition of the risk set. For a standard cause-specific hazard model, an individual is removed from the risk set after experiencing *any* type of event. In contrast, for the subdistribution hazard of cause $k$, individuals who experience a competing event (i.e., not cause $k$) are retained in the risk set, although they can no longer experience the event of interest [@problem_id:4987862]. This counterintuitive construction ensures that the model directly corresponds to the CIF.

The PSH model assumes that covariates have a multiplicative effect on the subdistribution hazard, i.e., $\lambda_k^*(t \mid X) = \lambda_{k,0}^*(t) \exp(\beta_k^T X)$. A key insight is that this model is equivalent to a proportional hazards model on the complementary log-[log transformation](@entry_id:267035) of the CIF. Specifically, a subdistribution hazard ratio of $\exp(\gamma)$ for a covariate corresponds to a constant additive shift of $\gamma$ on the scale of $\log(-\log[1-F_k(t \mid X)])$ across all time points $t$. It does not correspond to a constant risk ratio or risk difference, a common point of misinterpretation [@problem_id:4987815].

Other direct modeling approaches exist. For instance, one can model the CIF at a fixed time point, $t^*$, using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with pseudo-values. This technique allows the use of various [link functions](@entry_id:636388), such as the identity link to model the risk difference or the [logit link](@entry_id:162579) to model the odds of cumulative incidence. When the complementary log-log link is used, this approach targets the same estimand as the Fine-Gray model, providing a flexible alternative for direct risk prediction at specific horizons [@problem_id:4987863].

### Non-Parametric Comparison and Hypothesis Testing

Before engaging in complex regression modeling, a fundamental analytic step is often to compare CIF curves between different groups (e.g., treatment vs. control arms in a clinical trial). A simple visual inspection of Aalen-Johansen curves may suggest a difference, but formal [hypothesis testing](@entry_id:142556) is required to assess [statistical significance](@entry_id:147554).

The standard log-rank test, used for comparing Kaplan-Meier curves, is inappropriate for comparing CIFs because it is designed for a single event type and does not properly account for the influence of competing events. The appropriate generalization for this purpose is Gray's test. This is a non-parametric test that compares the CIFs of two or more groups. The test statistic is constructed as a weighted sum of the differences between the observed and expected number of cause-$k$ events in a group at each event time, under the null hypothesis that the cause-specific hazards are equal across groups. The expected count is derived from the pooled experience of all groups. The variance estimator correctly accounts for tied event times using a [hypergeometric distribution](@entry_id:193745) assumption [@problem_id:4987834].

A standard and powerful choice for the weight function in Gray's test is the pooled Kaplan-Meier estimate of the overall (all-cause) [survival function](@entry_id:267383), $\hat{S}(t-)$. This weighting scheme makes the test particularly sensitive to differences in CIFs that arise at earlier time points when a larger proportion of the cohort is still event-free. This aligns with the definition of the CIF, where differences in cause-specific hazards are naturally weighted by the probability of surviving event-free up to that time [@problem_id:4987834].

### Evaluating Prognostic Models for Absolute Risk

Developing a model to predict the CIF is only the first step. The next, equally crucial, step is to rigorously evaluate its performance. Model evaluation in a [competing risks](@entry_id:173277) setting extends standard concepts of calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility to properly account for censoring and the nature of the CIF as the target of prediction.

#### Calibration

Calibration assesses the agreement between predicted probabilities and observed event frequencies. A well-calibrated model for absolute risk will produce predictions that are, on average, correct. For a model predicting the CIF for cause $k$ at a horizon $t^*$, $\hat{F}_k(t^* \mid X)$, a calibration plot is the gold standard for assessment. The procedure involves sorting all subjects by their predicted risk, grouping them into deciles, and for each decile, plotting the mean predicted risk against the "observed" risk.

In the presence of [competing risks](@entry_id:173277) and censoring, the "observed" risk for a group cannot be a simple proportion. Instead, it must be estimated using a method that properly handles these complexities. The Aalen-Johansen estimator is the correct tool for this purpose. By applying the Aalen-Johansen estimator to the subjects within each risk decile, one obtains a consistent nonparametric estimate of the true group-wise CIF, which can then be compared to the mean model prediction for that group. A plot of these points against the line of identity ($y=x$) reveals any systematic over- or under-prediction across the spectrum of risk [@problem_id:4987804].

#### Prediction Error

Beyond calibration, it is important to quantify the overall accuracy of the predictions. The Brier score measures the [mean squared error](@entry_id:276542) between the predicted probability and the actual outcome. For a [prediction horizon](@entry_id:261473) $t^*$, the outcome is binary: did the subject experience an event of cause $k$ by time $t^*$ or not?

Because the true outcome is unobserved for subjects who are censored before $t^*$, a naive Brier score calculation would be biased. To obtain a consistent estimate of the [prediction error](@entry_id:753692), one must use Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW). In this method, each subject for whom the outcome is known (i.e., those who have an event before $t^*$ or who are followed event-free beyond $t^*$) is weighted by the inverse of their probability of remaining uncensored up to that point. This re-weighting creates a pseudo-population in which no censoring occurs, allowing for an unbiased estimation of the model's true Brier score. The censoring probabilities are typically estimated from the data, for example, using a Kaplan-Meier estimator or a Cox model for the censoring process itself [@problem_id:4987864].

#### Clinical Utility and Decision Curve Analysis

A model can be statistically accurate but clinically useless. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) is a method for evaluating the clinical utility of a prediction model by quantifying its net benefit across a range of risk thresholds. Net benefit is defined based on the consequences of clinical decisions (e.g., to administer a treatment). In a competing risks setting, DCA is defined in terms of the CIF. The benefit of correctly treating a patient who will have the event of interest is weighed against the harm of treating a patient who will not. The "true rate" of the event of interest is precisely the CIF. Therefore, the net benefit of a decision policy is calculated using the CIF as the measure of true risk among the treated population. Critically, using the complement of a Kaplan-Meier estimate in place of the CIF for DCA in a [competing risks](@entry_id:173277) setting would inflate the perceived benefit of a model and lead to flawed conclusions about its clinical value [@problem_id:4553200].

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Advanced Topics

The CIF is not just a statistical tool; it is a foundational concept that connects biostatistics with causal inference, machine learning, and the ethical practice of medicine.

#### Causal Inference

In many real-world applications, such as analyzing electronic health record (EHR) data, the goal is not just prediction but causal inference: what would be the effect of a specific intervention on a patient's absolute risk? In this context, the target estimand is the counterfactual CIF, which represents the cumulative incidence of an event had all subjects in the population received a particular treatment. When emulating a target trial using observational data, the CIF under each treatment strategy is the key quantity to be estimated. Death and other events must be treated as competing risks, not censoring, to avoid biased overestimation of the risk of the primary outcome [@problem_id:4612548].

For more complex scenarios involving time-varying treatments and confounders, the g-formula provides a general framework for identifying the causal CIF. The formula expresses the marginal CIF under a specified intervention as an integral over time of the averaged conditional event densities. This density at each time point is the product of the conditional cause-specific hazard and the conditional overall [survival probability](@entry_id:137919), averaged over the distribution of time-varying covariate histories. This powerful theoretical tool firmly embeds the CIF within the modern apparatus of causal inference [@problem_id:4987843].

#### Machine Learning for Competing Risks

As datasets grow in size and complexity, machine learning methods are increasingly adapted for survival analysis. Random Survival Forests (RSF), for example, can be extended to handle competing risks. In a competing risks RSF, each tree in the ensemble partitions the data into terminal leaves. Within each leaf, a nonparametric estimate of the CIF is computed for each cause using the Aalen-Johansen method on the subjects belonging to that leaf. The final prediction for a new individual is the average of these leaf-level CIF estimates across all trees in the forest. Hyperparameters, such as the minimum leaf size, play a critical role in the [bias-variance trade-off](@entry_id:141977). Smaller leaves can capture more heterogeneity but may lead to high-variance, poorly calibrated predictions due to the small number of subjects available for estimation, especially at later time points. Larger leaves reduce variance but may increase bias by pooling dissimilar subjects [@problem_id:5181607]. This highlights the need for careful tuning and evaluation, including calibration assessment, when applying advanced machine learning models to predict absolute risk.

#### Applications in Clinical Research and Ethical Reporting

The correct application and interpretation of the CIF have profound implications for clinical research design and the ethical communication of results.

In clinical trials, composite endpoints, which combine several outcomes into a single measure, are common. When the components are first-event outcomes (e.g., nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death), they constitute a [competing risks](@entry_id:173277) problem. The CIF of the composite endpoint is simply the sum of the component-specific CIFs. Analyzing the components separately reveals the contribution of each to the overall composite event rate, which can change over time. For instance, a nonfatal component may dominate early in follow-up, while a fatal component may become more dominant later as its hazard increases or acts upon the surviving population [@problem_id:5001577].

Perhaps the most critical application is the avoidance of misinterpretation. A recurring and dangerous error in medical literature is to treat competing events as [non-informative censoring](@entry_id:170081) and use the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the probability of the event of interest. This approach systematically overestimates the true absolute risk because it fails to account for individuals who are no longer at risk because they have experienced a competing event. This overestimation can be substantial and has been documented in diverse fields from oncology to transplantation surgery [@problem_id:4892216] [@problem_id:5199111].

This [statistical error](@entry_id:140054) carries significant ethical weight. Consider a hypothetical trial where a new treatment does not alter the biological hazard of the primary outcome but increases the hazard of a fatal competing event. Because more patients die from the competing cause, they have less time to experience the primary outcome. This results in a lower CIF for the primary outcome in the treatment group. Reporting only this "reduction" in cumulative incidence would be dangerously misleading, as it would frame a harmful treatment as beneficial. Ethical transparency demands the reporting of both cause-specific hazards (to reflect the biological/etiologic effects) and the cumulative incidence functions for all major outcomes (to reflect the absolute risks and overall patient experience). This dual reporting, accompanied by a clear explanation of why the CIF may differ from what the cause-specific hazards alone might suggest, is essential for informed clinical decision-making and upholding scientific integrity [@problem_id:4961844].
