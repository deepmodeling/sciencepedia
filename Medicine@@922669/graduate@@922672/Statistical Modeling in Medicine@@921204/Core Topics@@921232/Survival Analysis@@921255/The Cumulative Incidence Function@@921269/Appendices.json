It is formally defined using the cause-specific hazard $\\lambda_k(t)$ and the overall survival function $S(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T > t)$ as:\n$$F_k(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) S(u-) du$$\nwhere $S(u-) = \\mathbb{P}(T \\ge u)$.\n\nIn a nonparametric setting with discrete time points, this integral becomes a sum. The standard nonparametric estimator for the CIF is the Aalen-Johansen estimator, which is given by:\n$$\\hat{F}_k(t) = \\sum_{t_j \\leq t} \\hat{S}(t_j-) \\frac{d_k(t_j)}{Y(t_j)}$$\nHere, $t_j$ are the ordered event times, $d_k(t_j)$ is the number of events of cause $k$ at $t_j$, and $Y(t_j)$ is the number of subjects at risk just before $t_j$. The term $\\hat{S}(t_j-)$ is the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the overall survival probability just before time $t_j$. It is calculated as:\n$$\\hat{S}(t_j-) = \\prod_{t_i  t_j} \\left(1 - \\frac{d(t_i)}{Y(t_i)}\\right)$$\nwhere $d(t_i) = \\sum_k d_k(t_i)$ is the total number of events at time $t_i$. By convention, $\\hat{S}(t_1-) = 1$.\n\nWe proceed by first calculating the necessary survival estimates.\nThe total number of events at each time point are:\n- $d(t_1) = d_1(t_1) + d_2(t_1) = 3 + 2 = 5$\n- $d(t_2) = d_1(t_2) + d_2(t_2) = 2 + 2 = 4$\n- $d(t_3) = d_1(t_3) + d_2(t_3) = 1 + 5 = 6$\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier survival estimates are:\n- $\\hat{S}(t_1-) = 1$.\n- The estimate after events at $t_1$: $\\hat{S}(t_1) = \\hat{S}(t_1-)\\left(1 - \\frac{d(t_1)}{Y(t_1)}\\right) = 1 \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{200}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{40} = \\frac{39}{40}$.\n- For the next step, $\\hat{S}(t_2-) = \\hat{S}(t_1) = \\frac{39}{40}$.\n- The estimate after events at $t_2$: $\\hat{S}(t_2) = \\hat{S}(t_2-)\\left(1 - \\frac{d(t_2)}{Y(t_2)}\\right) = \\frac{39}{40} \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{193}\\right) = \\frac{39}{40} \\left(\\frac{189}{193}\\right) = \\frac{7371}{7720}$.\n- For the final step, $\\hat{S}(t_3-) = \\hat{S}(t_2) = \\frac{7371}{7720}$.\n- The estimate after events at $t_3$: $\\hat{S}(t_3) = \\hat{S}(t_3-)\\left(1 - \\frac{d(t_3)}{Y(t_3)}\\right) = \\frac{7371}{7720} \\left(1 - \\frac{6}{188}\\right) = \\frac{7371}{7720} \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{94}\\right) = \\frac{7371}{7720} \\left(\\frac{91}{94}\\right) = \\frac{670761}{725680}$.\n\nNow we can compute the CIF estimates $\\hat{F}_1(t_j)$ and $\\hat{F}_2(t_j)$.\n\n**Calculation of $\\hat{F}_1(t)$:**\n- At time $t_1$:\n$$\\hat{F}_1(t_1) = \\hat{S}(t_1-) \\frac{d_1(t_1)}{Y(t_1)} = 1 \\times \\frac{3}{200} = \\frac{3}{200}$$\n- At time $t_2$:\n$$\\hat{F}_1(t_2) = \\hat{F}_1(t_1) + \\hat{S}(t_2-) \\frac{d_1(t_2)}{Y(t_2)} = \\frac{3}{200} + \\frac{39}{40} \\times \\frac{2}{193} = \\frac{3}{200} + \\frac{39}{3860}$$\nThe least common denominator of $200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$ and $3860 = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 193$ is $38600 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 193$.\n$$\\hat{F}_1(t_2) = \\frac{3 \\times 193}{38600} + \\frac{39 \\times 10}{38600} = \\frac{579 + 390}{38600} = \\frac{969}{38600}$$\nThis fraction is in simplest terms as $969 = 3 \\times 17 \\times 19$ and $38600 = 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\times 193$.\n\n- At time $t_3$:\n$$\\hat{F}_1(t_3) = \\hat{F}_1(t_2) + \\hat{S}(t_3-) \\frac{d_1(t_3)}{Y(t_3)} = \\frac{969}{38600} + \\frac{7371}{7720} \\times \\frac{1}{188} = \\frac{969}{38600} + \\frac{7371}{1451360}$$\nThe least common denominator of $38600 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 193$ and $1451360 = 2^5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 47 \\cdot 193$ is $7256800 = 2^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 47 \\cdot 193$.\n$$\\hat{F}_1(t_3) = \\frac{969 \\times 188}{7256800} + \\frac{7371 \\times 5}{7256800} = \\frac{182172 + 36855}{7256800} = \\frac{219027}{7256800}$$\nThe prime factors of the numerator are $3, 17, 19, 227$ (since $219027 = 3 \\times 17 \\times 19 \\times [969 \\times 188 + 7371 \\times 5]$ leads to complex factorization, checking prime divisors is more direct, e.g., $219027=3 \\times 73009$).

The total number of events at $t_j$ is $d_j = d_{1j} + d_{2j}$. Censored observations are denoted by $c_j$. The distinct event times are $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\n**1. Computation of the Cumulative Incidence Function $F_1(5)$**\n\nThe estimator for the cumulative incidence function for cause $k=1$ is given by $\\widehat{F}_1(t) = \\sum_{t_j \\le t} \\widehat{S}(t_{j-1}) \\frac{d_{1j}}{n_j}$, where $\\widehat{S}(t)$ is the overall event-free survival function and $t_{j-1}$ is the time of the previous event. The overall survival is estimated using the product-limit formula: $\\widehat{S}(t) = \\prod_{t_j \\le t} (1 - \\frac{d_j}{n_j})$, with the convention that $\\widehat{S}(0) = 1$.\n\nWe construct a table to track the calculations:\n- At $t_1=1$: $n_1=12$, $d_{11}=1$, $d_{21}=2$, so $d_1=3$.\n  - The increment to $\\widehat{F}_1$ is $\\widehat{S}(0) \\frac{d_{11}}{n_1} = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n  - The overall survival at $t=1$ is $\\widehat{S}(1) = \\widehat{S}(0) \\times (1 - \\frac{d_1}{n_1}) = 1 \\times (1 - \\frac{3}{12}) = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n- At $t_2=2$: The number at risk is $n_2=12-3=9$. We have $d_{12}=1$ and $d_{22}=1$, so $d_2=2$.\n  - The increment to $\\widehat{F}_1$ is $\\widehat{S}(1) \\frac{d_{12}}{n_2} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n  - The overall survival at $t=2$ is $\\widehat{S}(2) = \\widehat{S}(1) \\times (1 - \\frac{d_2}{n_2}) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times (1 - \\frac{2}{9}) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{7}{12}$.\n- At $t_3=3$: The number at risk is $n_3=9-2=7$. We have $d_{13}=1$ and $d_{23}=0$, so $d_3=1$.\n  - The increment to $\\widehat{F}_1$ is $\\widehat{S}(2) \\frac{d_{13}}{n_3} = \\frac{7}{12} \\times \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{7}{84} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n  - The overall survival at $t=3$ is $\\widehat{S}(3) = \\widehat{S}(2) \\times (1 - \\frac{d_3}{n_3}) = \\frac{7}{12} \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{7}) = \\frac{7}{12} \\times \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- At $t_4=4$: The number at risk is $n_4=7-1=6$. We have $d_{14}=0$ and $d_{24}=1$, so $d_4=1$.\n  - The increment to $\\widehat{F}_1$ is $\\widehat{S}(3) \\frac{d_{14}}{n_4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{0}{6} = 0$.\n  - The overall survival at $t=4$ is $\\widehat{S}(4) = \\widehat{S}(3) \\times (1 - \\frac{d_4}{n_4}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{6}) = \\frac{5}{12}$.\n- At $t_5=5$: The number at risk is $n_5=6-1=5$. We have $d_{15}=0$ and $d_{25}=1$, so $d_5=1$.\n  - The increment to $\\widehat{F}_1$ is $\\widehat{S}(4) \\frac{d_{15}}{n_5} = \\frac{5}{12} \\times \\frac{0}{5} = 0$.\n  - The overall survival at $t=5$ is $\\widehat{S}(5) = \\widehat{S}(4) \\times (1 - \\frac{d_5}{n_5}) = \\frac{5}{12} \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe cumulative incidence for cause $1$ at $t=5$ is the sum of the increments up to this time:\n$$F_1(5) = \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} + 0 + 0 = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n**2. Computation of $1 - \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(5)$**\n\nIn this analysis, events of cause $2$ are treated as right-censored. The events of interest are only cause $1$ deaths. The event times for cause $1$ are $t^* \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nLet $d_j^*$ be the number of cause $1$ events at time $t_j^*$, and $n_j^*$ be the number at risk.\n- At $t_1^*=1$: $n_1^*=12$, $d_1^*=1$. At this time, $2$ individuals are censored due to cause $2$ events.\n  - $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(1) = (1 - \\frac{d_1^*}{n_1^*}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{11}{12}$.\n  - The number at risk for the next step is $12 - 1 - 2 = 9$.\n- At $t_2^*=2$: $n_2^*=9$, $d_2^*=1$. At this time, $1$ individual is censored due to a cause $2$ event.\n  - $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(2) = \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(1) \\times (1 - \\frac{d_2^*}{n_2^*}) = \\frac{11}{12} \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{9}) = \\frac{11}{12} \\times \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{88}{108} = \\frac{22}{27}$.\n  - The number at risk for the next step is $9 - 1 - 1 = 7$.\n- At $t_3^*=3$: $n_3^*=7$, $d_3^*=1$. No other censoring occurs at this time.\n  - $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(3) = \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(2) \\times (1 - \\frac{d_3^*}{n_3^*}) = \\frac{22}{27} \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{7}) = \\frac{22}{27} \\times \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{132}{189} = \\frac{44}{63}$.\nThe last event of interest (cause $1$) occurred at $t=3$. For $t > 3$, the Kaplan-Meier estimate remains constant until the next event, but there are no further events of interest. Therefore, $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(5) = \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(3) = \\frac{44}{63}$.\nThe complement is:\n$$1 - \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(5) = 1 - \\frac{44}{63} = \\frac{63-44}{63} = \\frac{19}{63}$$\n\n**3. Computation of the Magnitude of Overestimation**\n\nThe overestimation is the difference between the naive (1-KM) estimate and the correct CIF estimate:\n$$\\text{Overestimation} = \\left[1 - \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM,censor-comp}}(5)\\right] - F_1(5)$$\n$$\\text{Overestimation} = \\frac{19}{63} - \\frac{1}{4}$$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $\\text{lcm}(63, 4) = 252$.\n$$\\text{Overestimation} = \\frac{19 \\times 4}{63 \\times 4} - \\frac{1 \\times 63}{4 \\times 63} = \\frac{76}{252} - \\frac{63}{252} = \\frac{76 - 63}{252} = \\frac{13}{252}$$\nThe prime factors of the denominator are $252 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7$. The numerator is the prime number $13$. Thus, the fraction is irreducible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{13}{252}}$$", "id": "4987838"}]}
