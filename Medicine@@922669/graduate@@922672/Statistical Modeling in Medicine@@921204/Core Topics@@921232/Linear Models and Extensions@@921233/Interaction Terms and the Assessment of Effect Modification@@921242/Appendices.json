A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis of interaction between two exposures, $X$ and $Z$, on a binary outcome $Y$ can be conducted on an additive scale or a multiplicative scale. The problem requires an assessment on both scales.\n\nFirst, we define the excess risk. For a given exposure, the excess risk is the risk in the exposed group minus the risk in the unexposed (baseline) group. This is also known as the risk difference ($RD$).\n-   Excess risk for exposure $X$ alone: $ER_{10} = p_{10} - p_{00}$.\n-   Excess risk for exposure $Z$ alone: $ER_{01} = p_{01} - p_{00}$.\n-   Excess risk for both exposures $X$ and $Z$: $ER_{11} = p_{11} - p_{00}$.\n\nAdditive interaction is defined as a departure from the additivity of individual excess risks. If there were no additive interaction, the excess risk from the combined exposure would be equal to the sum of the excess risks from each exposure individually.\nExpected excess risk under additivity: $ER_{10} + ER_{01}$.\nThe observed excess risk in the doubly exposed group is $ER_{11}$.\n\nThe degree of additive interaction is quantified by the Interaction Contrast ($IC$), which is the difference between the observed joint excess risk and the expected joint excess risk under additivity.\n$$IC = ER_{11} - (ER_{10} + ER_{01})$$\nSubstituting the definitions of excess risk:\n$$IC = (p_{11} - p_{00}) - [(p_{10} - p_{00}) + (p_{01} - p_{00})]$$\n$$IC = p_{11} - p_{00} - p_{10} + p_{00} - p_{01} + p_{00}$$\n$$IC = p_{11} - p_{10} - p_{01} + p_{00}$$\n\nThe Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI) is a standardized measure of additive interaction. It is defined as the Interaction Contrast divided by the baseline risk, $p_{00}$. This normalizes the interaction measure, making it a relative measure. This is the first part of the derivation as requested, expressing RERI in terms of $p_{xz}$.\n$$RERI = \\frac{IC}{p_{00}} = \\frac{p_{11} - p_{10} - p_{01} + p_{00}}{p_{00}}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for RERI in terms of risk ratios ($RR_{xz}$), we divide each term in the numerator by $p_{00}$:\n$$RERI = \\frac{p_{11}}{p_{00}} - \\frac{p_{10}}{p_{00}} - \\frac{p_{01}}{p_{00}} + \\frac{p_{00}}{p_{00}}$$\nBy the definition $RR_{xz} = p_{xz}/p_{00}$, we can substitute these terms. Note that $RR_{00} = p_{00}/p_{00} = 1$.\n$$RERI = RR_{11} - RR_{10} - RR_{01} + 1$$\nThis is the standard formula for RERI in terms of risk ratios. The absence of additive interaction corresponds to $RERI = 0$. A positive RERI ($RERI>0$) indicates positive additive interaction (synergy), and a negative RERI ($RERI0$) indicates negative additive interaction (antagonism).\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of RERI using the given risk ratios: $RR_{10} = 2.0$, $RR_{01} = 3.0$, and $RR_{11} = 4.5$.\n$$RERI = 4.5 - 2.0 - 3.0 + 1$$\n$$RERI = 4.5 - 5.0 + 1$$\n$$RERI = -0.5 + 1$$\n$$RERI = 0.5$$\nSince $RERI = 0.5 > 0$, there is evidence of a positive additive interaction, or synergy on the additive scale. The interaction accounts for an excess risk of $0.5$ times the baseline risk.\n\nNext, we assess for multiplicative interaction. Interaction on the multiplicative scale is absent if the joint risk ratio equals the product of the individual risk ratios.\nCondition for no multiplicative interaction: $RR_{11} = RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$.\n-   If $RR_{11} > RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$, the interaction is supra-multiplicative (synergistic).\n-   If $RR_{11}  RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$, the interaction is sub-multiplicative (antagonistic).\n\nWe are given $RR_{10} = 2.0$, $RR_{01} = 3.0$, and $RR_{11} = 4.5$.\nFirst, calculate the product of the individual risk ratios:\n$$RR_{10} \\times RR_{01} = 2.0 \\times 3.0 = 6.0$$\nNow, compare this product to the observed joint risk ratio, $RR_{11}$:\n$$4.5  6.0$$\nSince $RR_{11}  RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$, the joint effect is sub-multiplicative. This means that the combined effect of smoking and poor glycemic control is less than what would be predicted by multiplying their individual effects.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the exposures exhibit synergistic interaction on the additive scale ($RERI > 0$) but antagonistic interaction on the multiplicative scale ($RR_{11}  RR_{10} \\cdot RR_{01}$). This is a common finding in epidemiology and highlights the importance of specifying the scale (additive or multiplicative) on which interaction is being assessed.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of RERI.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4966962"}, {"introduction": "Once an interaction term is included in a model, interpreting the main effect coefficients becomes more complex, as they represent conditional effects. This practice [@problem_id:4966989] introduces a powerful technique to aid interpretation: centering continuous predictor variables.

The conditional effect of $X$ on the link scale is defined as the simple slope with respect to $X$, holding $Z$ fixed, and analogously for $Z$. Clinicians propose re-expressing the model using centered variables $X_{c} = X - x_{0}$ and $Z_{c} = Z - z_{0}$, where $x_{0}$ and $z_{0}$ are clinically meaningful anchor values (for example, a typical intake target and a clinical threshold for kidney function). Consider the implications of this reparameterization for interpretation and estimation.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct about centering $X$ and $Z$ at clinically meaningful values in the presence of a continuous-by-continuous interaction?\n\nA. In the reparameterized model using $X_{c}$ and $Z_{c}$, the coefficient multiplying $X_{c}$ equals the conditional effect (simple slope) of $X$ evaluated at $Z = z_{0}$ on the model’s linear predictor (link) scale.\n\nB. Centering $X$ and $Z$ at $x_{0}$ and $z_{0}$ changes the estimate and hypothesis test for the interaction coefficient, so the statistical significance of $\\beta_{3}$ can differ before and after centering.\n\nC. Centering at clinically meaningful $x_{0}$ and $z_{0}$ makes the intercept equal to the model’s expected outcome at $X = x_{0}$ and $Z = z_{0}$ (after applying the inverse link if interpretation on the outcome scale is desired), thereby aiding clinical interpretation.\n\nD. Centering $X$ and $Z$ at $x_{0}$ and $z_{0}$ eliminates effect modification, because the interaction term can be absorbed into the main effects after centering.\n\nE. Centering can reduce non-essential multicollinearity between the main-effect terms and their product $X Z$, potentially improving numerical stability and the precision of estimated main effects, without changing fitted values or goodness-of-fit.", "solution": "We begin from the definition of a generalized linear model (GLM) with link function $g(\\cdot)$ and linear predictor\n$$\n\\eta(X,Z) \\equiv g\\!\\left(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X,Z]\\right) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\beta_{2} Z + \\beta_{3} X Z.\n$$\nIn this model, the presence of the product term $X Z$ encodes effect modification of the effect of $X$ by $Z$ (and vice versa) on the linear predictor scale. The conditional effect of $X$ on the linear predictor scale at a fixed $Z$ is the simple slope defined by the partial derivative\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta(X,Z)}{\\partial X} = \\beta_{1} + \\beta_{3} Z,\n$$\nand similarly the conditional effect of $Z$ at a fixed $X$ is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta(X,Z)}{\\partial Z} = \\beta_{2} + \\beta_{3} X.\n$$\nThese are direct consequences of linearity of $\\eta$ in the regressors and standard calculus.\n\nNow consider centering at clinically meaningful anchors $x_{0}$ and $z_{0}$ by defining $X_{c} = X - x_{0}$ and $Z_{c} = Z - z_{0}$.

On the outcome scale, this corresponds to $g^{-1}(\\beta_{0}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x_{0}, Z = z_{0}]$.\n\nBecause the reparameterization is a linear, one-to-one change of variables in the regressors, the column space of the design matrix is unchanged. Therefore, fitted values $\\hat{\\eta}$ and hence $\\hat{g(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X,Z])}$ are identical before and after centering, as are likelihood, residual deviance, and any hypothesis tests that involve only the invariant parameter $\\beta_{3}$ (for example, $H_{0}\\!:\\, \\beta_{3} = 0$). What does change is the interpretation of the main-effect coefficients: after centering, they represent clinically anchored simple slopes.\n\nCentering can also affect correlations among regressors. To see why, consider the correlation of a main effect with the product term. For illustration, under a scenario where $X$ and $Z$ are independent and have mean zero after centering, we have\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}\\!\\left(X_{c}, X_{c} Z_{c}\\right) = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[X_{c}^{2} Z_{c}\\right] - \\mathbb{E}[X_{c}]\\,\\mathbb{E}[X_{c} Z_{c}] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{c}^{2}]\\,\\mathbb{E}[Z_{c}] - 0 \\cdot 0 = 0,\n$$\nand analogously $\\operatorname{Cov}\\!\\left(Z_{c}, X_{c} Z_{c}\\right) = 0$. Even without independence, subtracting $x_{0}$ and $z_{0}$ removes large mean-induced components in the product expansion $X Z = X_{c} Z_{c} + x_{0} Z_{c} + z_{0} X_{c} + x_{0} z_{0}$, which can reduce non-essential multicollinearity between main effects and the interaction term. While this reduction is not guaranteed in every joint distribution, it often improves numerical stability and the precision of main-effect estimates, without altering fitted values.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. This follows directly from the reparameterization: the coefficient of $X_{c}$ is $\\beta_{1}^{\\ast} = \\beta_{1} + \\beta_{3} z_{0} = \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial X}\\big|_{Z=z_{0}}$. This is precisely the simple slope of $X$ at $Z = z_{0}$ on the link scale. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Because $\\beta_{3}^{\\ast} = \\beta_{3}$ and the design matrix column for the interaction is unchanged up to linear combinations of other centered columns, the estimate and test for $\\beta_{3}$ are invariant to centering. In particular, the statistical significance of $\\beta_{3}$ does not change under centering. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. From $\\beta_{0}^{\\ast} = \\eta(x_{0},z_{0})$, the intercept corresponds to the linear predictor at $X = x_{0}, Z = z_{0}$. On the outcome scale, $g^{-1}(\\beta_{0}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x_{0}, Z = z_{0}]$, which directly aids clinical interpretation by anchoring the baseline at meaningful values. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. The interaction term remains present with unchanged coefficient $\\beta_{3}^{\\ast} = \\beta_{3}$. Centering does not eliminate effect modification; it only relocates the reference point for interpreting main effects and intercept. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. As argued, centering can reduce non-essential multicollinearity between main effects and their product, for example yielding $\\operatorname{Cov}\\!\\left(X_{c}, X_{c} Z_{c}\\right) = 0$ under mean-zero independence, and more generally diminishing mean-induced correlations via the expansion of $X Z$. This can improve numerical stability and precision of main-effect estimates, while leaving fitted values and overall fit unchanged due to the invariance of the column space.

Total $N_1 = 190+810+20+80 = 1100$.\n\nThe numerator of $\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}$ is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{a_i d_i}{N_i} = \\frac{a_0 d_0}{N_0} + \\frac{a_1 d_1}{N_1} = \\frac{5 \\times 990}{2000} + \\frac{190 \\times 80}{1100} = \\frac{4950}{2000} + \\frac{15200}{1100} = 2.475 + \\frac{152}{11} $$\nThe denominator of $\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}$ is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{b_i c_i}{N_i} = \\frac{b_0 c_0}{N_0} + \\frac{b_1 c_1}{N_1} = \\frac{995 \\times 10}{2000} + \\frac{810 \\times 20}{1100} = \\frac{9950}{2000} + \\frac{16200}{1100} = 4.975 + \\frac{162}{11} $$\nLet's use common denominators to be precise:\n$$ \\sum \\frac{a_i d_i}{N_i} = \\frac{99}{40} + \\frac{152}{11} = \\frac{99 \\times 11 + 152 \\times 40}{440} = \\frac{1089 + 6080}{440} = \\frac{7169}{440} $$\n$$ \\sum \\frac{b_i c_i}{N_i} = \\frac{199}{40} + \\frac{162}{11} = \\frac{199 \\times 11 + 162 \\times 40}{440} = \\frac{2189 + 6480}{440} = \\frac{8669}{440} $$\nSo, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio is:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} = \\frac{7169/440}{8669/440} = \\frac{7169}{8669} \\approx 0.8271 $$\nThis adjusted odds ratio is less than $1$, reflecting the protective effect seen within the strata, thus resolving the paradox.\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference, $\\ln(\\text{OR}_{\\text{marginal}}) - \\ln(\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}})$.\nUsing the exact fractional forms:\n$\\text{OR}_{\\text{marginal}} = \\frac{1391}{361}$\n$\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} = \\frac{7169}{8669}$\n\nThe quantity to compute is:\n$$ \\ln(\\text{OR}_{\\text{marginal}}) - \\ln(\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{OR}_{\\text{marginal}}}{\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}}\\right) $$\n$$ = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1391/361}{7169/8669}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1391 \\times 8669}{361 \\times 7169}\\right) $$\nNow we use numerical values for calculation:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{marginal}} \\approx 3.8531856 $$\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} \\approx 0.8270850 $$\n$$ \\ln(\\text{OR}_{\\text{marginal}}) \\approx \\ln(3.8531856) \\approx 1.34888 $$\n$$ \\ln(\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}) \\approx \\ln(0.8270850) \\approx -0.18983 $$\nThe difference is:\n$$ \\ln(\\text{OR}_{\\text{marginal}}) - \\ln(\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}) \\approx 1.34888 - (-0.18983) = 1.34888 + 0.18983 = 1.53871 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.539$.\nThis value represents the magnitude of confounding by $G$ on the log-odds ratio scale.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.539}$$", "id": "4967010"}]}
