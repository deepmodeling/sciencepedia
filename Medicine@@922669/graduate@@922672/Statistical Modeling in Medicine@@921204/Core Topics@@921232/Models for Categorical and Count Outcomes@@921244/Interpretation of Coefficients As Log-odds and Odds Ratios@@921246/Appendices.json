Second, we calculate the number of infections that the committee *assumes* will be prevented by incorrectly using the odds ratio as a risk ratio. The difference between these two values is the required overestimation.\n\nLet $p_0$ be the risk of infection in the control group (standard care) and $p_1$ be the true risk of infection in the treated group. We are given $p_{0} = 0.30$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the true number of prevented infections**\n\nThe coefficient from the logistic regression, $\\beta_{1}$, is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio (OR).\n$$ \\beta_{1} = \\ln(\\text{OR}) $$\nGiven $\\beta_{1} = \\ln(0.60)$, we can find the odds ratio by exponentiating the coefficient:\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\exp(\\beta_{1}) = \\exp(\\ln(0.60)) = 0.60 $$\nThe odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of infection in the treated group ($\\text{Odds}_1$) to the odds of infection in the control group ($\\text{Odds}_0$).\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_1}{\\text{Odds}_0} $$\nThe odds for the control group are calculated from the baseline risk $p_0$ using the provided definition:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.30}{1-0.30} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\nWe can now calculate the odds for the treated group:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_1 = \\text{OR} \\times \\text{Odds}_0 = 0.60 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{9}{35} $$\nTo find the true risk in the treated group, $p_1$, we convert the odds back to a probability.

Specifically, the distribution of $\\hat{\\beta}$ is approximated by a normal distribution with mean equal to the true parameter value $\\beta$ and variance equal to the square of its standard error, $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})$. This can be stated as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} \\stackrel{\\text{approx}}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\beta, [\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})]^2\\right)\n$$\nBy standardizing the random variable $\\hat{\\beta}$, we obtain a pivot quantity that approximately follows a standard normal distribution:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{\\beta} - \\beta}{\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})} \\stackrel{\\text{approx}}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\n$$\nLet $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ be the $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution, such that $\\Pr(Z \\le z_{1-\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha/2$ for $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.
