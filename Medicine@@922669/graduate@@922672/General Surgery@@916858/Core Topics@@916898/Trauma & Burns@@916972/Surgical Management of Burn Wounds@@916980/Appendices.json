Therefore, the combined constant fraction for both arms, trunk (anterior and posterior), and perineum is $0.550$.\n- Consequently, the combined fraction allocated to the head plus both lower limbs is $1.000 - 0.550 = 0.450$ for all ages.\n- For preschool children ($\\approx 2$–$5$ years), anthropometric data embedded in the Lund–Browder chart allocate the head a fraction of approximately $0.170$; the remainder of the head-plus-legs total is then distributed equally to each leg.\n\nFrom these well-tested premises, determine the fractions to assign to the anterior trunk and the entire right leg in this $4$-year-old, sum them to obtain the involved $\\mathrm{TBSA}$, and express your final answer as a decimal fraction of $1.000$.

It presents a clear clinical scenario requiring the application of the Lund-Browder method for estimating Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) in a pediatric burn patient. All necessary data and rules for the calculation are provided within the problem statement. The principles described are consistent with established medical and biometric practice.\n\nThe objective is to compute the fraction of total body surface area ($\\mathrm{TBSA}$) involved in a $4$-year-old patient with full-thickness burns to the entire right leg and the entire anterior trunk. The calculation will be based on the provided principles of the Lund-Browder chart.\n\nThe total involved $\\mathrm{TBSA}$ is the sum of the fractional areas of the affected regions:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{anterior trunk}} + \\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{right leg}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we determine the fractional area of the anterior trunk. The problem states that the trunk is an age-invariant region, with the anterior trunk consistently assigned a fraction of the total body surface area.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{anterior trunk}} = 0.180\n$$\nThis value is constant across all age groups because the trunk's contribution to total body surface area is relatively stable throughout human growth from childhood to adulthood.\n\nNext, we determine the fractional area of the entire right leg for a child aged $4$ years. This calculation requires using the age-dependent rules provided. The problem states that the combined fractional area for the head and both lower limbs is constant across all ages:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{head}} + \\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{both legs}} = 0.450\n$$\nThis principle reflects that as a child grows, the proportional surface area of the head decreases while the proportional surface area of the legs increases, with the total for these parts remaining constant relative to the rest of the body (trunk, arms, perineum).\n\nFor a preschool child of age $4$ years, the problem specifies that the head is allocated a fractional area of approximately:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{head}} = 0.170\n$$\nThis larger fraction for the head is a key feature of pediatric anthropometrics, as young children have proportionally larger heads than adults.\n\nWe can now calculate the combined fractional area for both lower limbs by subtracting the head's fraction from the constant total:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{both legs}} = 0.450 - \\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{head}} = 0.450 - 0.170 = 0.280\n$$\n\nThe problem states that this total fraction for the lower limbs is distributed equally between the right and left leg. Therefore, the fractional area for a single leg (the right leg in this case) is half of this value:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{right leg}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{both legs}}}{2} = \\frac{0.280}{2} = 0.140\n$$\nThis value of $0.140$ for a single leg is smaller than the corresponding adult value (typically $0.180$ or $0.190$ for an entire leg, which would be $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (0.450 - 0.070) = 0.190$), correctly reflecting the smaller proportional surface area of the legs in young children.\n\nFinally, we sum the fractional areas of the two affected regions to find the total involved $\\mathrm{TBSA}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{anterior trunk}} + \\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{right leg}} = 0.180 + 0.140 = 0.320\n$$\nThe result is expressed as a decimal fraction to three significant figures as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.320}\n$$", "id": "4672550"}, {"introduction": "Once the burn size is estimated, the immediate priority shifts to preventing burn shock through aggressive fluid resuscitation.

On arrival $2$ hours post-injury, he is alert and normothermic. The right forearm shows a circumferential leathery eschar with progressive swelling, severe pain with passive finger extension, and paresthesias in the median nerve distribution. Dopplerable radial and ulnar signals are present. The hand is cool but pink. The right leg has patchy full-thickness burns medially with deep muscle tenderness in the calf. Initial laboratory values: serum potassium $6.1$ mmol/L, creatine kinase (CK) $18{,}000$ U/L, creatinine $1.5$ mg/dL, serum bicarbonate $18$ mmol/L. Urinalysis is positive for “blood” on dipstick with minimal red blood cells (RBCs) on microscopy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows peaked T waves. A Foley catheter is placed.

Measured intracompartmental pressures in the forearm are: volar $42$ mmHg, dorsal $28$ mmHg; in the leg: anterior $24$ mmHg, deep posterior $32$ mmHg.\n\nUsing only fundamental principles of tissue perfusion and well-established pathophysiology of electrical burns and rhabdomyolysis, select the option that best outlines a stepwise decision algorithm for this patient that integrates appropriate monitoring and explicit thresholds for when to perform escharotomy versus fasciotomy, and how to manage rhabdomyolysis to prevent acute kidney injury. Each option proposes a distinct algorithm; choose the one that is most scientifically sound and surgically appropriate.\n\nA. Initiate immediate isotonic crystalloid resuscitation targeting urine output of $1$–$2$ mL/kg/hour via Foley; continuously monitor ECG and serum potassium, creatinine, CK, and acid–base status every $4$–$6$ hours; measure limb compartment pressures serially every $1$–$2$ hours if at risk. If there is a circumferential inelastic eschar with distal constriction but soft compartments, perform escharotomy first. If clinical signs of compartment syndrome are present or if the perfusion–compartment gradient (diastolic blood pressure minus compartment pressure) is $\\leq 30$ mmHg in any compartment, perform urgent fasciotomy of all involved compartments in that limb segment and decompress adjunct compartments (for the forearm, include carpal tunnel). Begin hyperkalemia management emergently (intravenous calcium, insulin with dextrose, inhaled beta-agonist, and sodium bicarbonate if acidemic). After adequate volume resuscitation and once urine output is $\\geq 1$ mL/kg/hour, consider urine alkalinization to maintain urine pH $>6.5$ to reduce myoglobin nephrotoxicity; avoid potassium-containing fluids. Continue CK and electrolyte monitoring until downward trend and normalization.\n\nB. Withhold fasciotomy unless distal pulses become absent, pain becomes excruciating despite opioids, or CK exceeds $50{,}000$ U/L. Rely on clinical pain alone; compartment pressure measurements are unnecessary. Begin furosemide to drive diuresis before aggressive fluids; use lactated Ringer’s with added potassium for rhabdomyolysis. Escharotomy is unnecessary if pulses are present; reassess in $24$ hours.\n\nC. Perform fasciotomy only when the absolute compartment pressure is $>50$ mmHg; diastolic blood pressure is irrelevant to decision-making. Maintain urine output at $0.3$ mL/kg/hour to avoid fluid overload; give sodium bicarbonate infusion before fluid resuscitation to alkalinize urine. Do not perform escharotomy; fasciotomy alone addresses both skin and deep tissue constriction.\n\nD. For high-voltage electrical injuries, perform prophylactic fasciotomy of all compartments in any limb with CK $>5{,}000$ U/L, even in the absence of pain with passive stretch, paresthesias, or low perfusion–compartment gradients. Limit monitoring to pulses and capillary refill; hyperkalemia typically self-corrects with time, so no immediate treatment is needed. Avoid mannitol and urine alkalinization entirely.\n\nE. If circumferential burns are present with tense swelling, perform escharotomy and delay any fasciotomy until the systolic blood pressure minus compartment pressure is $\\leq 50$ mmHg. Target urine output $>0.5$ mL/kg/hour and maintain urine pH $>5.5$ without attention to volume status. Serum potassium should be rechecked once daily unless pulses are lost.\n\nWhich option is the best algorithm for this patient?", "solution": "The problem requires integrating fundamental principles of microvascular perfusion with the distinctive risks in electrical burns and the renal hazards of rhabdomyolysis to construct a stepwise plan that specifies monitoring and thresholds for decompression.\n\nPrinciple-based derivation:\n\n1. Tissue perfusion in a closed myofascial compartment depends on a pressure gradient driving flow through capillaries. A minimal capillary perfusion pressure is required to keep capillaries patent. From first principles, capillary transmural pressure is the difference between intraluminal pressure and surrounding tissue pressure. Because capillary inflow occurs during diastole, a clinically useful surrogate for the driving pressure is diastolic arterial pressure minus compartment (tissue) pressure. If this gradient falls to a low value, capillary collapse and ischemia ensue. Well-accepted clinical data support a threshold perfusion–compartment gradient of approximately $\\leq 30$ mmHg as indicating high risk for ischemia warranting decompression, especially when combined with clinical signs (pain with passive stretch, paresthesias, tense compartments). In this case, with diastolic blood pressure $70$ mmHg, the volar forearm gradient is $70 - 42 = 28$ mmHg (concerning), the dorsal is $70 - 28 = 42$ mmHg (less concerning), and the deep posterior leg is $70 - 32 = 38$ mmHg (borderline but above the common threshold). Clinical signs are present in the forearm (pain with passive stretch, paresthesias), and the limb has a circumferential eschar adding constrictive forces.\n\n2. Electrical burns cause deep muscle injury, edema, and thrombosis along neurovascular bundles, often with deceptively benign skin findings. Therefore, thresholds for fasciotomy should not rely on pulses, which can be preserved until late. Early fasciotomy is indicated when clinical signs are present or when the perfusion–compartment gradient is at or below the accepted threshold in any compartment, with complete release of all anatomic compartments in the involved segment (for the forearm: volar, dorsal, mobile wad, and carpal tunnel).\n\n3. Escharotomy versus fasciotomy: A circumferential inelastic eschar can restrict superficial perfusion and venous return; escharotomy addresses skin-level constriction. However, when deep compartments are ischemic (by signs or pressure criteria), fasciotomy is required; escharotomy alone is insufficient.\n\n4. Rhabdomyolysis pathophysiology: Skeletal muscle necrosis releases myoglobin and potassium. Myoglobin precipitates in acidic urine and causes direct tubular toxicity and obstruction, particularly when renal perfusion is low. Prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) rests on aggressive isotonic crystalloid resuscitation to increase renal perfusion and maintain high urinary flow rates, typically targeting urine output $1$–$2$ mL/kg/hour. Once adequate flow is established, urine alkalinization to maintain urine pH $>6.5$ can reduce myoglobin precipitation. Fluids should avoid potassium. Creatine kinase (CK) correlates with muscle injury severity; levels $>5{,}000$ U/L are associated with increased AKI risk but are not, in isolation, surgical indications for fasciotomy.\n\n5. Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening membrane depolarization problem. ECG changes (peaked T waves) and potassium $6.1$ mmol/L warrant immediate temporizing therapy: intravenous calcium to stabilize cardiac membranes, insulin with dextrose and inhaled beta-agonist to shift potassium intracellularly, and sodium bicarbonate if acidemic. Ongoing monitoring of electrolytes and ECG is essential.\n\n6. Monitoring cadence: In a dynamically evolving compartment syndrome, serial examinations and compartment pressure measurements every $1$–$2$ hours are justified until the limb is decompressed or the risk subsides. Urine output should be monitored hourly via Foley catheter. Laboratory surveillance of CK, electrolytes, creatinine, and acid–base status every $4$–$6$ hours guides resuscitation and detects complications.\n\nApplying these principles to the case:\n- The forearm has clinical signs and a perfusion–compartment gradient of $28$ mmHg in the volar compartment, meeting common criteria for urgent fasciotomy, with release of all forearm compartments and the carpal tunnel. The circumferential eschar may also require escharotomy if superficial constriction persists, but fasciotomy is the critical decompressive step for deep ischemia.\n- The leg compartments are close to, but not below, the common gradient threshold; they require close serial reassessment and repeat pressure measurements. If signs evolve or the gradient drops to $\\leq 30$ mmHg, fasciotomy should be performed for the leg as well.\n- Aggressive isotonic crystalloid resuscitation is required to achieve urine output $1$–$2$ mL/kg/hour, with early hyperkalemia treatment and consideration of urine alkalinization after adequate volume is achieved.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option correctly:\n- Targets urine output $1$–$2$ mL/kg/hour via Foley, consistent with preventing myoglobin-induced AKI.\n- Specifies continuous ECG and serial laboratory monitoring at reasonable intervals ($4$–$6$ hours) and serial compartment pressure checks ($1$–$2$ hours) in at-risk limbs.\n- Distinguishes escharotomy (for circumferential constrictive eschar) from fasciotomy (for deep compartment syndrome), and prioritizes fasciotomy when clinical signs are present or when the perfusion–compartment gradient (diastolic minus compartment pressure) is $\\leq 30$ mmHg.\n- Advises full release of all relevant compartments and carpal tunnel in the forearm.\n- Calls for immediate, appropriate hyperkalemia management.\n- Introduces urine alkalinization to a urine pH $>6.5$ only after adequate volume resuscitation and diuresis, and avoids potassium-containing fluids.\nThis aligns with the fundamental physiology and accepted thresholds. Correct.\n\nB. This option inappropriately:\n- Delays fasciotomy until pulses are absent or CK is extremely high ($>50{,}000$ U/L), ignoring that pulses can persist and CK is not a surgical trigger.\n- Eschews compartment pressure measurements, relying solely on pain.\n- Promotes diuresis with furosemide before volume resuscitation, which risks worsening renal hypoperfusion.\n- Suggests potassium-containing fluids in hyperkalemia, which is unsafe.\n- Dismisses escharotomy despite circumferential eschar. Incorrect.\n\nC. This option:\n- Uses an absolute pressure threshold of $>50$ mmHg, ignoring the dependence of perfusion on diastolic pressure and the validated perfusion–compartment gradient concept.\n- Targets inadequate urine output ($0.3$ mL/kg/hour) and gives bicarbonate before fluids, risking alkalosis without renal perfusion and worsening hypovolemia.\n- Suggests that fasciotomy obviates escharotomy, which is false; each addresses different levels of constriction. Incorrect.\n\nD. This option:\n- Advocates prophylactic fasciotomy based solely on CK $>5{,}000$ U/L, which is not evidence-based and subjects patients to unnecessary morbidity.\n- Minimizes monitoring to pulses and capillary refill, which are insensitive for compartment syndrome.\n- Suggests hyperkalemia will self-correct, which is dangerous in the setting of ECG changes and potassium $6.1$ mmol/L.\n- Categorically avoids alkalinization, ignoring its role after adequate resuscitation. Incorrect.\n\nE. This option:\n- Uses systolic rather than diastolic pressure to define a gradient and sets an inappropriate threshold of $\\leq 50$ mmHg.\n- Targets too-low urine output ($>0.5$ mL/kg/hour) and a urine pH $>5.5$ (insufficient to limit myoglobin precipitation).\n- Defers electrolyte monitoring despite severe hyperkalemia and ECG changes.
