## Introduction
The initial evaluation of a burn patient is a critical juncture where accurate assessment directly translates into effective, life-saving care. The severity of a burn injury is defined by two key dimensions: its depth, which dictates local wound management, and its size, which governs the systemic response. Misjudging either can lead to significant morbidity, from inadequate fluid resuscitation and shock to poor wound healing and functional loss. This article provides a comprehensive framework for mastering burn wound assessment. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, delves into the pathophysiological basis of thermal injury and the established methods for classifying burn depth and estimating Total Body Surface Area (TBSA). The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, explores how these foundational skills are applied in complex clinical scenarios, considering special populations and injury types. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** offers a series of problems to test and refine your assessment capabilities. By navigating these sections, you will gain the knowledge to confidently and accurately classify burn injuries, forming the cornerstone of effective patient management.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The clinical assessment of a burn injury is founded on two independent but complementary dimensions: the **depth** of tissue injury and the **size** of the burn, expressed as a percentage of the total body surface area ($TBSA$). Understanding the principles and mechanisms behind the classification of depth and the estimation of size is fundamental to prognostication, resuscitation, and therapeutic planning. Burn depth determines the local wound's healing potential and the need for surgical intervention, whereas burn size is the primary determinant of the systemic inflammatory response and the magnitude of required fluid resuscitation.

### A Pathophysiological Model of Thermal Injury: The Jackson Burn Wound Model

A thermal injury is not a uniform event but rather a gradient of tissue damage that radiates from a point of maximal thermal insult. This concept is elegantly captured by the **Jackson Burn Wound Model**, which describes three concentric zones of injury, each defined by distinct cellular and microvascular characteristics. Understanding these zones is crucial, as they explain the dynamic nature of a burn wound in the hours and days following injury.

The central zone, receiving the most intense thermal dose, is the **zone of coagulation**. Here, the temperature and duration of exposure are sufficient to cause irreversible denaturation of cellular proteins and coagulative necrosis. All cellular elements, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and the endothelial cells lining blood vessels, are destroyed. The microvasculature is thrombosed, resulting in an immediate and permanent cessation of blood flow. This tissue is non-viable and will ultimately demarcate as eschar, requiring surgical removal.

Surrounding the zone of coagulation is the **zone of stasis**. This region receives a sublethal but significant thermal dose. Cells here are initially viable but exist in a precarious state of ischemia. The primary pathology resides in the microcirculation. Endothelial injury leads to increased vascular permeability, causing plasma to leak into the interstitial space, resulting in edema. Simultaneously, the release of inflammatory mediators triggers vasodilation and promotes the adhesion of leukocytes to the damaged endothelium, further obstructing [capillary flow](@entry_id:149434). This process, combined with fluid loss from the intravascular space (hemoconcentration), leads to blood sludging and severely reduced perfusion. The fate of the zone of stasis is not predetermined; it is the primary battleground in early burn care. Inadequate systemic perfusion or excessive inflammation can cause this zone to progress to necrosis, effectively expanding the central zone of coagulation. Conversely, timely and adequate fluid resuscitation can restore perfusion and salvage this tissue. Therefore, the zone of stasis represents the critical, salvageable component of the burn wound [@problem_id:4606094].

The outermost zone is the **zone of hyperemia**. This tissue receives a mild thermal dose, insufficient to cause direct cellular death but enough to induce a robust inflammatory response characterized by vasodilation. This increased blood flow is clinically apparent as erythema (redness). The microvasculature in this zone remains patent and largely intact. The zone of hyperemia is not considered at risk for necrosis and is expected to recover fully as the inflammation subsides.

### Classification of Burn Depth: From Degrees to Thickness

The language used to classify burn depth has evolved to enhance clinical precision. The historical nomenclature of first-, second-, third-, and fourth-degree burns has been largely replaced by a system based on the anatomical depth of injury. This modern, thickness-based terminology—**superficial**, **partial-thickness**, and **full-thickness**—reduces ambiguity because it directly correlates with the wound's biological healing potential and informs therapeutic decisions, such as the need for surgical grafting [@problem_id:4606117].

#### Superficial Burns

A **superficial burn** (historically, first-degree) involves injury confined exclusively to the **epidermis**. Clinically, these burns are characterized by erythema, dryness, and significant pain or tenderness, but without the formation of blisters. They blanch briskly with pressure, indicating that the underlying dermal microvasculature is patent and merely vasodilated. A common example is a typical sunburn [@problem_id:4606112]. Healing occurs rapidly, typically within 3 to 6 days, via re-epithelialization from the intact basal layer of the epidermis and does not result in scarring.

#### Partial-Thickness Burns

**Partial-thickness burns** (historically, second-degree) penetrate through the epidermis and into the dermis. This category is critically subdivided based on how deeply the injury extends into the dermal layer, as this distinction has profound implications for healing and management.

A **superficial partial-thickness burn** involves the epidermis and the superficial (papillary) layer of the dermis. These burns are classically characterized by the formation of blisters. When unroofed, the wound bed is moist, pink, and exquisitely painful due to the exposure of intact sensory nerve endings in the papillary dermis. Capillary refill is brisk, confirming that the superficial dermal vascular plexus, while injured and leaky, remains patent [@problem_id:4606175]. These burns retain a high potential for spontaneous healing. The dermal adnexal structures, such as hair follicles and sweat glands, which harbor reservoirs of [keratinocyte](@entry_id:271511) progenitors, are preserved. Healing occurs via re-epithelialization from these thousands of epithelial "islands" across the wound bed. The time to healing can be estimated from first principles: given a [keratinocyte](@entry_id:271511) migration speed ($v$) of approximately $0.25 \, \mathrm{mm/day}$ and a density ($d$) of adnexal sources on the forearm of about $25 \, \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, the characteristic spacing ($s$) between sources is $s \sim \sqrt{1/d} \approx 0.2 \, \mathrm{cm} = 2 \, \mathrm{mm}$. Migrating epithelial sheets from adjacent sources need only cover half this distance ($1 \, \mathrm{mm}$), taking approximately 4 days. After an additional 3 to 6 days for stratification, complete healing is achieved in approximately 7 to 10 days with minimal scarring [@problem_id:4606170].

A **deep partial-thickness burn** extends into the deeper (reticular) layer of the dermis. The clinical appearance is markedly different. The surface may be mottled red and white, is often drier, and capillary refill is sluggish or absent due to damage and thrombosis of the deeper vascular plexus. Sensation is typically reduced because superficial nerve endings have been destroyed [@problem_id:4606175] [@problem_id:4606083]. Healing is slow (often $>3$ weeks) and tenuous because many of the adnexal structures have been damaged. These burns have a high propensity to heal with significant hypertrophic scarring and contracture, and are therefore often managed with surgical excision and skin grafting for a superior functional and cosmetic outcome. The historical lumping of both superficial and deep partial-thickness burns under the single label "second-degree" created significant clinical ambiguity, which the modern nomenclature resolves.

#### Full-Thickness and Deeper Burns

A **full-thickness burn** (historically, third-degree) entails the destruction of the entire thickness of the skin—both the epidermis and the full dermis. Clinically, these wounds appear as a dry, inelastic, leathery, or waxy eschar, which may be white, brown, or charred. As all nerve endings in the dermis are destroyed, the area is insensate to light touch and pinprick. The dermal vascular plexus is completely thrombosed, resulting in an absence of blanching or capillary refill [@problem_id:4606109].

Crucially, full-thickness burns cannot re-epithelialize spontaneously. The thermal injury destroys all epidermal and dermal adnexal sources of [keratinocyte](@entry_id:271511) stem cells. Healing can only occur from the wound edges, a process far too slow and ineffective for anything but the smallest of wounds. Without surgical intervention, these wounds heal by slow contraction and are prone to infection, severe scarring, and disability. Therefore, the standard of care for full-thickness burns is surgical excision of the eschar followed by skin grafting [@problem_id:4606122].

A **fourth-degree burn** describes an injury that extends beyond the skin into the underlying subcutaneous tissues, such as fat, fascia, muscle, tendon, or bone [@problem_id:4606117]. These are the most severe burns and require extensive surgical debridement and complex reconstruction.

### Quantification of Burn Size: Total Body Surface Area (TBSA)

The size of a burn is the principal driver of the systemic inflammatory response and resulting pathophysiologic changes, such as burn shock. Accurate estimation of the burn size, expressed as a percentage of Total Body Surface Area ($\%$TBSA), is therefore essential for guiding fluid resuscitation. A cardinal rule of TBSA estimation for resuscitation purposes is that **only partial-thickness and full-thickness (and deeper) burns are included in the calculation.** Superficial burns, despite being painful, do not cause the significant capillary leak that necessitates large-volume fluid resuscitation and are therefore excluded from the total [@problem_id:4606112] [@problem_id:4606129].

#### Estimation Methods in Adults

For adult patients, several methods are used to estimate $\%$TBSA.

The **Wallace Rule of Nines** is a rapid and widely used method that divides the adult body surface into regions that are multiples of $9\%$. The standard adult distribution is as follows [@problem_id:4606173]:
- Head and Neck: $9\%$
- Each Upper Limb: $9\%$
- Anterior Trunk (chest and abdomen): $18\%$
- Posterior Trunk (upper and lower back): $18\%$
- Each Lower Limb: $18\%$
- Perineum: $1\%$

For burns that do not cover an entire region, the area can be subdivided. For example, the anterior surface of an arm would be $4.5\%$, and the anterior surface of a leg would be $9\%$. For a patient with partial-thickness burns of the entire anterior trunk, a full-thickness burn of the anterior right arm, and partial-thickness burns of the perineum, the TBSA would be calculated as $18\% + 4.5\% + 1\% = 23.5\%$. If there were an additional small, patchy burn on the thigh, another method would be useful.

The **Palmar Method** is used to estimate the size of smaller, irregular, or scattered burns. The surface area of the patient's own palm, including the adducted fingers, is considered to be approximately $1\%$ of their TBSA [@problem_id:4606129].

#### Special Considerations in Pediatric Burns

The Rule of Nines is a reliable tool for adults but is inaccurate for young children due to differences in body proportions. Human growth is **cephalocaudal**, meaning that infants and young children have a proportionally larger head and smaller lower extremities compared to adults. For example, at birth, the head may constitute nearly $18\%$ of the TBSA, while each leg is only about $13-14\%$.

Applying the adult Rule of Nines to a young child will therefore introduce systematic, opposing biases: it will **underestimate** the significance of a head burn and **overestimate** the significance of a leg burn [@problem_id:4606167]. Given the critical importance of accurate TBSA estimation for calculating pediatric fluid resuscitation, this potential for error is clinically unacceptable.

The **Lund-Browder chart** is the gold standard for TBSA estimation in children. Its core principle is the use of age-specific regional percentages to account for the dynamic changes in body proportions during growth. The chart provides a table of TBSA percentages for detailed body parts across several age categories (e.g., $0-1$ year, $1-4$ years, etc.). As age increases, the chart **redistributes** the percentage weights, decreasing the allocation for the head and increasing the allocation for the lower limbs. For any given age, the sum of all regional percentages is constrained to be exactly $100\%$, ensuring internal consistency [@problem_id:4606105]. This age-adjusted approach provides the most accurate estimation of burn size in the pediatric population.

### Synthesis: Integrating Depth and Size in Clinical Practice

In the initial evaluation of a burn patient, the clinician must synthesize the findings of depth and size to formulate a comprehensive management plan. These two dimensions, while assessed concurrently, guide different aspects of care.

- **Burn Depth** determines the **local wound management**. Superficial and most superficial partial-thickness burns will heal spontaneously and are managed with topical agents and dressings. Deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns will likely require surgical intervention with excision and autografting to achieve timely closure, prevent infection, and minimize scar contracture.

- **Burn Size ($\%$TBSA)** determines the **systemic management**. Burns exceeding approximately $15-20\%$ TBSA in an adult will trigger a systemic inflammatory response requiring formal intravenous fluid resuscitation, typically guided by formulas like the Parkland formula ($4 \, \mathrm{mL} \cdot \mathrm{kg}^{-1} \cdot \% \mathrm{TBSA}$ of crystalloid over $24$ hours). TBSA is also a key factor in determining patient disposition, as large burns or those involving critical areas (e.g., hands, face, joints) meet criteria for transfer to a specialized burn center [@problem_id:4606083].

Consider a patient with a superficial partial-thickness burn of the anterior trunk ($18\%$ TBSA) and a full-thickness burn on the left forearm ($4.5\%$ TBSA). The total TBSA of $22.5\%$ dictates the need for aggressive fluid resuscitation. The burn depth guides the local plan: the trunk burn will likely heal with supportive care, while the full-thickness forearm burn will require excision and grafting for definitive closure. This integrated assessment, rooted in the principles of depth classification and size estimation, is the cornerstone of modern burn care.
