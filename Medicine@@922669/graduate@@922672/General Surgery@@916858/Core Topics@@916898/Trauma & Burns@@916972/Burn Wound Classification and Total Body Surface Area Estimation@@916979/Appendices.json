It is scientifically grounded in established principles of clinical medicine, specifically the methods for estimating the extent of burn injuries. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. It requests a calculation based on foundational knowledge in the field, which is a standard academic and clinical task.\n\nThe estimation of the total body surface area (TBSA) affected by a burn is a critical step in managing burn patients, as it guides fluid resuscitation and treatment decisions. For an adult patient with a normal body habitus, the most common and foundational method for rapid estimation is the \"Wallace Rule of Nines.\" This rule is the basis for the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental assumption is the applicability of the Rule of Nines, which partitions the adult body surface into regions that are multiples of $9\\%$. The anatomical partitioning under this rule is as follows:\n- The head and neck comprise $9\\%$ of TBSA.\n- The anterior trunk (chest and abdomen) comprises $18\\%$ of TBSA.\n- The posterior trunk (upper and lower back) comprises $18\\%$ of TBSA.\n- Each entire upper limb (arm, forearm, and hand) comprises $9\\%$ of TBSA.\n- Each entire lower limb (thigh, leg, and foot) comprises $18\\%$ of TBSA.\n- The perineum comprises the remaining $1\\%$ of TBSA.\nThe sum of these areas is $9\\% + 18\\% + 18\\% + 2 \\times 9\\% + 2 \\times 18\\% + 1\\% = 100\\%$. The problem specifies that the burns are of at least partial thickness, which is the standard threshold for inclusion in TBSA calculations for clinical management.\n\nWe will now calculate the TBSA involved based on the anatomical locations provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Anterior Trunk:** The problem states the burn involves the \"entire anterior trunk.\" According to the Rule of Nines, the TBSA for the entire anterior trunk is $18\\%$.\n    Let $A_{trunk}$ be the surface area of the anterior trunk.\n    $$A_{trunk} = 0.18$$\n\n2.  **Anterior Surfaces of Both Upper Limbs:** The problem states the burn involves the \"anterior surfaces of both upper limbs.\"\n    According to the Rule of Nines, one entire upper limb accounts for $9\\%$ of TBSA. The anterior surface is anatomically defined as half of the total surface area of the limb.\n    Let $A_{limb, \\text{single}}$ be the surface area of the anterior surface of a single upper limb.\n    $$A_{limb, \\text{single}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9\\% = 4.5\\%$$\n    Since the burns involve both upper limbs, the total contribution from the limbs, $A_{limbs}$, is twice this value.\n    $$A_{limbs} = 2 \\times A_{limb, \\text{single}} = 2 \\times 4.5\\% = 9\\%$$\n    As a decimal fraction, this is:\n    $$A_{limbs} = 0.09$$\n\nThe total body surface area, $TBSA_{total}$, involved is the sum of the TBSA from the anterior trunk and anterior surfaces of both upper limbs.\n$$TBSA_{total} = A_{trunk} + A_{limbs}$$\n$$TBSA_{total} = 18\\% + 9\\% = 27\\%$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be expressed as a decimal fraction of total body surface area, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$TBSA_{total} = 0.27$$\nTo express $0.27$ with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$TBSA_{total} \\approx 0.270$$\nThis final value represents the estimated fraction of the patient's total body surface area that has sustained at least a partial-thickness burn.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.270}$$", "id": "4606096"}, {"introduction": "For scattered or patchy burns, the 'palmar method' offers a practical estimation tool, where the patient's palmar surface is used as a proxy for approximately $1\\%$ of TBSA.

Burns are classified by depth, and it is standard in clinical burn estimation to include partial-thickness and full-thickness areas in the Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) while excluding purely superficial erythema. The palmar method relies on the patient's palmar surface (including fingers) as a reference unit: let $p$ denote the fraction of the patient's TBSA occupied by one entire palmar surface (including fingers). Clinical teaching often treats $p$ as approximately $0.0100$, yielding a palmar-method estimate $\\hat{f}$ of burned fraction of TBSA for $n$ palm-sized partial-thickness wounds as $\\hat{f} = n \\times 0.0100$, which in this case would be $0.12$. \n\nAnthropometric variability implies $p$ varies among adults.

The total burned area, $A_{\\text{burned}}$, is therefore:\n$$A_{\\text{burned}} = n \\times A_{\\text{palm}}$$\n\nThe true fraction of TBSA that is burned, denoted by $f$, is the ratio of the total burned area to the total body surface area:\n$$f = \\frac{A_{\\text{burned}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{n \\times A_{\\text{palm}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = n \\times p$$\nGiven $n=12$, the true burned fraction is $f = 12p$.\n\nThe palmar-method estimate, $\\hat{f}$, is calculated using a standard approximate value for the palmar fraction, $p_{\\text{est}} = 0.0100$.\n$$\\hat{f} = n \\times p_{\\text{est}} = 12 \\times 0.0100 = 0.12$$\n\nThe absolute error, $E$, between the true fraction $f$ and the estimated fraction $\\hat{f}$ is a function of the true palmar fraction $p$:\n$$E(p) = |f - \\hat{f}| = |n \\times p - n \\times p_{\\text{est}}| = |n(p - p_{\\text{est}})|$$\nUsing the given values for $n$ and $p_{\\text{est}}$:\n$$E(p) = |12(p - 0.0100)| = 12 |p - 0.0100|$$\n\nTo find the worst-case (maximum) absolute error, $E_{\\max}$, we must find the maximum value of $E(p)$ over the given interval for $p$, which is $p \\in [0.0090, 0.0110]$.\n$$E_{\\max} = \\max_{p \\in [0.0090, 0.0110]} E(p) = \\max_{p \\in [0.0090, 0.0110]} 12 |p - 0.0100|$$\nThis is equivalent to maximizing the term $|p - 0.0100|$ on the specified interval. The expression $|p - 0.0100|$ represents the distance of $p$ from the central value $0.0100$. This distance is maximized at the endpoints of the interval $[0.0090, 0.0110]$.\n\nWe evaluate the term at both endpoints:\nAt $p = 0.0090$:\n$$|p - 0.0100| = |0.0090 - 0.0100| = |-0.0010| = 0.0010$$\nAt $p = 0.0110$:\n$$|p - 0.0100| = |0.0110 - 0.0100| = |0.0010| = 0.0010$$\nThe maximum value of $|p - 0.0100|$ on the interval is $0.0010$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum absolute error, $E_{\\max}$:\n$$E_{\\max} = 12 \\times 0.0010 = 0.012$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

When partitioning, anatomical boundaries are defined by midlines (for example, mid-axillary line separating anterior and posterior trunk) and joint-based transitions (for example, the glenohumeral region delineating trunk from upper limb).

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to identify the option that correctly describes the methodology for handling a boundary-crossing burn and yields the correct TBSA and full-thickness TBSA values.\n\n**Principle 1: Calculation of Resuscitation-Relevant TBSA**\n\nThe core principle to avoid double counting for a burn that crosses anatomical regions is to partition the burn area along those boundaries. The total TBSA is the sum of the TBSA contributions from each disjoint partition.\n\n1.  **Contribution from the Anterior Trunk:**\n    The anterior trunk represents $18\\%$ of the total body surface area. The burn covers $25\\%$ of this region.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{ant trunk}} = 0.25 \\times 18\\% = 4.5\\% $$\n\n2.  **Contribution from the Posterior Trunk:**\n    The posterior trunk represents $18\\%$ of the total body surface area. The burn covers $5\\%$ of this region.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{post trunk}} = 0.05 \\times 18\\% = 0.9\\% $$\n\n3.  **Contribution from the Left Upper Limb:**\n    The entire left upper limb represents $9\\%$ of the total body surface area. The burn covers $40\\%$ of this region.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{left arm}} = 0.40 \\times 9\\% = 3.6\\% $$\n\n4.  **Total TBSA of the Primary Burn:**\n    The total TBSA of this irregular burn is the sum of the contributions from each anatomical segment it covers.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{primary burn}} = \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{ant trunk}} + \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{post trunk}} + \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{left arm}} $$\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{primary burn}} = 4.5\\% + 0.9\\% + 3.6\\% = 9.0\\% $$\n\n5.  **Handling the Secondary Burn:**\n    The problem states there is a superficial erythematous burn on the right thigh of $2\\%$ TBSA. The given rules explicitly state that such burns are not included in the TBSA calculation relevant for resuscitation. Therefore, this $2\\%$ is excluded.\n\n6.  **Final Resuscitation-Relevant TBSA:**\n    The final TBSA is the sum of all non-superficial burns.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{total}} = 9.0\\% $$\n\n**Principle 2: Calculation of Full-Thickness TBSA**\n\nThe full-thickness component is a subset of the total burn area. The problem states that $30\\%$ of the \"traced shoulder–arm burn polygon\" is full thickness. The area of this polygon was calculated as $9.0\\%$ TBSA.\n\n1.  **Full-Thickness TBSA Calculation:**\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{full thickness}} = 30\\% \\times \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{primary burn}} $$\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{full thickness}} = 0.30 \\times 9.0\\% = 2.7\\% $$\n\nThe correct approach must therefore state that the TBSA is $9.0\\%$ and the full-thickness TBSA is $2.7\\%$, based on the principle of partitioning the burn and excluding superficial erythema.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Trace the burn once on an age-appropriate chart and partition strictly along anatomical segment boundaries (for example, mid-axillary line for anterior versus posterior trunk; acromial/glenohumeral transition for trunk versus arm) so that no area lies in two segments. Allocate fractional coverage to each segment and sum disjoint contributions: anterior trunk $25\\%$ of $18\\%$ gives $4.5\\%$, posterior trunk $5\\%$ of $18\\%$ gives $0.9\\%$, and left arm $40\\%$ of $9\\%$ gives $3.6\\%$, totaling $9.0\\%$ TBSA burned. Treat depth categories as nested subsets: full-thickness TBSA is $30\\%$ of the traced polygon, i.e., $0.30 \\times 9.0\\% = 2.7\\%$. Exclude the $2\\%$ superficial thigh erythema from burned TBSA.**\n-   **Methodology**: The described method of partitioning and summing disjoint contributions is the scientifically correct way to prevent double counting. The treatment of depth categories as nested subsets is also correct. The exclusion of superficial erythema is correct.\n-   **Calculations**: The calculation of TBSA contributions from each segment ($4.5\\%$, $0.9\\%$, $3.6\\%$) and their sum ($9.0\\%$) is arithmetically correct. The calculation of full-thickness TBSA ($0.30 \\times 9.0\\% = 2.7\\%$) is also correct.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct. This option accurately describes the correct principles and performs all calculations flawlessly.\n\n**B. Sum coverage across all segments as in the tracing, then increase the total by the fraction that is full thickness to reflect severity. Include the superficial thigh since it is skin injury. Report $4.5\\% + 0.9\\% + 3.6\\% = 9.0\\%$, then add $2.7\\%$ again for full thickness and $2.0\\%$ for the thigh, for a final total of $13.7\\%$.**\n-   **Methodology**: This option makes two major conceptual errors. First, it incorrectly adds the full-thickness area to the total burn area. Full-thickness burn is a *type* of burn within the total area, not an additional area. Second, it incorrectly includes superficial erythema in the resuscitation-relevant TBSA.\n-   **Calculations**: The initial summation to $9.0\\%$ is correct, but the subsequent additions are based on a flawed understanding of burn assessment. The final result of $13.7\\%$ is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The methodology is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**C. To avoid double counting at boundaries, assign the entire shoulder–arm polygon to the single segment with the largest share and ignore the smaller shares. Classify depth by multiplying this segment’s contribution by the full-thickness fraction. Report $40\\%$ of $9\\%$ as $3.6\\%$ TBSA burned and $0.30 \\times 3.6\\% = 1.08\\%$ full-thickness TBSA.**\n-   **Methodology**: This option proposes an inaccurate and arbitrary approximation method (\"winner-take-all\") instead of the correct partitioning method. This would lead to significant errors. Here, it ignores the $4.5\\%$ and $0.9\\%$ contributions from the trunk.\n-   **Calculations**: The calculation is internally consistent with the flawed method but grossly underestimates the true TBSA ($3.6\\%$ vs the correct $9.0\\%$) and the full-thickness TBSA ($1.08\\%$ vs the correct $2.7\\%$).\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The method for handling boundaries is scientifically unsound.\n\n**D. Because the burn wraps over the shoulder, split at boundaries but double the trunk contribution to account for anterior–posterior continuity at the lateral chest. Report $2 \\times 4.5\\% + 0.9\\% + 3.6\\% = 13.5\\%$ TBSA burned, with full thickness $0.30 \\times 13.5\\% = 4.05\\%$, and add the superficial thigh $2.0\\%$ for a total of $15.5\\%$.**\n-   **Methodology**: This option introduces an arbitrary and incorrect rule to \"double the trunk contribution.\" This is a form of double counting, precisely what the correct partitioning method is designed to avoid. The mid-axillary line already provides a non-overlapping boundary. It also incorrectly includes the superficial burn.\n-   **Calculations**: The calculations are based on the flawed method, leading to a significant overestimation of TBSA ($13.5\\%$ vs $9.0\\%$) and a cascade of further errors.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The methodology is arbitrary and introduces double counting.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4606151"}]}
