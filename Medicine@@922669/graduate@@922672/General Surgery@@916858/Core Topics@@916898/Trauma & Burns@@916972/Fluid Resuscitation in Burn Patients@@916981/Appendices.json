The description of the fluid resuscitation framework is consistent with the Parkland formula, a standard method for this purpose.\n\nThe Parkland formula for the total crystalloid volume required in the first $24$ hours post-injury, denoted as $V_{24}$, is given by:\n$$ V_{24} = C \\times m \\times A $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant, typically $4 \\,\\mathrm{mL}/(\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\%)$, $m$ is the patient's body mass in kilograms, and $A$ is the percentage of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burned.\n\nThe standard distribution protocol dictates that one-half of the total $24$-hour volume is administered in the first $8$ hours post-injury. This volume for the first $8$ hours, $V_8$, is:\n$$ V_8 = \\frac{1}{2} V_{24} $$\n\nLet us proceed with the calculation based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, we identify the given values:\n- Patient's mass, $m = 82 \\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Percentage of TBSA burned, $A = 36$.

The model proposed, where fluid volume is proportional to body mass and burn size, directly corresponds to standard resuscitation formulas, most notably the Parkland formula. The values provided for body mass ($70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$) and burn size ($25\\%$) are clinically realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and defines a clear relationship (the model) and a specific objective (calculating the volume difference). The solution is unique and stable.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language without subjective or opinion-based claims. The term \"well-tested clinical principles\" is appropriately concretized by the instruction to model the volume requirement as a direct proportionality, which points to a specific class of resuscitation formulas.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the defined flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). The instruction to use a model \"consistent with standard adult practice\" is a valid way to reference a known principle (the Parkland formula) without naming it explicitly, requiring the solver to possess the relevant domain knowledge.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the $24$-hour crystalloid requirement, $V$, as proportional to body mass, $m$, and the burned fraction, $f$. This can be expressed as:\n$$V = k \\cdot m \\cdot f$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant. The problem states that $k$ must be \"consistent with standard adult practice\" for burn resuscitation. The most widely used formula for this purpose is the Parkland formula, which states:\n$$V_{\\text{mL}} = 4 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\%} \\times m_{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times \\text{TBSA}_{\\%}$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{mL}}$ is the volume in milliliters, $m_{\\mathrm{kg}}$ is the mass in kilograms, and $\\text{TBSA}_{\\%}$ is the percentage of Total Body Surface Area burned.\n\nThe problem uses the burned *fraction* $f$, not the percentage. The relationship between the fraction $f$ and percentage $\\text{TBSA}_{\\%}$ is:\n$$\\text{TBSA}_{\\%} = 100 \\cdot f$$\nSubstituting this into the Parkland formula gives:\n$$V_{\\text{mL}} = 4 \\cdot m \\cdot (100 \\cdot f) = 400 \\cdot m \\cdot f$$\nThis equation now matches the structure of the problem's required model, $V = k \\cdot m \\cdot f$. By comparing the two, we identify the proportionality constant for a volume in milliliters as $k_{\\text{mL}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer in liters. We can convert the constant $k$ to units of $\\mathrm{L/kg}$:\n$$k_{\\text{L}} = \\frac{400\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{mL/L}} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{L/kg}$$\nThus, the model for the volume in liters is:\n$$V_{\\text{L}} = 0.4 \\cdot m \\cdot f$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $m = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n-   $f_{\\text{true}} = 0.25$\n\nThe estimated fraction, $f_{\\text{est}}$, is given by a $10$ percent relative overestimation of the true fraction:\n$$f_{\\text{est}} = f_{\\text{true}}(1 + 0.10) = 0.25 \\cdot (1.10) = 0.275$$\n\nThe volume of fluid calculated using the true burn fraction is:\n$$V_{\\text{true}} = 0.4 \\cdot m \\cdot f_{\\text{true}}$$\nThe volume of fluid calculated using the overestimated burn fraction is:\n$$V_{\\text{est}} = 0.4 \\cdot m \\cdot f_{\\text{est}}$$\n\nThe absolute difference in volume, $\\Delta V$, is:\n$$\\Delta V = |V_{\\text{est}} - V_{\\text{true}}|$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the volumes:\n$$\\Delta V = |(0.4 \\cdot m \\cdot f_{\\text{est}}) - (0.4 \\cdot m \\cdot f_{\\text{true}})|$$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$$\\Delta V = 0.4 \\cdot m \\cdot |f_{\\text{est}} - f_{\\text{true}}|$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$m = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\n$$|f_{\\text{est}} - f_{\\text{true}}| = |0.275 - 0.25| = 0.025$$\nPlugging these into the equation for $\\Delta V$:\n$$\\Delta V = 0.4 \\cdot 70 \\cdot 0.025$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\\Delta V = 28 \\cdot 0.025$$\n$$\\Delta V = 0.7$$\nThe resulting volume difference is $0.7\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

All necessary data are provided, the terminology is precise, and the question is based on established principles and formulas within general surgery and burn care.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total fluid volume for the first $24$ hours of resuscitation for a burn patient using two different formulas: the Parkland approach and the Modified Brooke approach. It also requires a discussion of the physiological implications of these volumes, specifically concerning the risk of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS).\n\nThe givens are:\nPatient mass, $m = 90$ kilograms.\nTotal Body Surface Area burned, TBSA $= 0.50 = 50\\%$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required fluid volume using the Parkland formula. The Parkland formula for the total crystalloid volume, $V_{\\text{Parkland}}$, to be administered over the first $24$ hours is given by:\n$$V = 4 \\text{ mL} \\times (\\text{mass in kg}) \\times (\\% \\text{TBSA})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{\\text{Parkland}} = 4 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\%} \\times 90 \\text{ kg} \\times 50$$\n$$V_{\\text{Parkland}} = 18000 \\text{ mL}$$\nTo express this volume in liters, we use the conversion $1000 \\text{ mL} = 1 \\text{ L}$:\n$$V_{\\text{Parkland}} = 18 \\text{ L}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the required fluid volume using the Modified Brooke formula. The Modified Brooke formula for the total crystalloid volume, $V_{\\text{ModBrooke}}$, to be administered over the first $24$ hours is given by:\n$$V = 2 \\text{ mL} \\times (\\text{mass in kg}) \\times (\\% \\text{TBSA})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{\\text{ModBrooke}} = 2 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\%} \\times 90 \\text{ kg} \\times 50$$\n$$V_{\\text{ModBrooke}} = 9000 \\text{ mL}$$\nConverting this volume to liters:\n$$V_{\\text{ModBrooke}} = 9 \\text{ L}$$\n\nThe Parkland approach calculates a $24$-hour fluid requirement of $18$ L, whereas the Modified Brooke approach calculates a requirement of $9$ L. The volume calculated by the Parkland formula is exactly double that of the Modified Brooke formula.\n\nThe physiological implications of these calculated volumes for the risk of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS) are significant. Large thermal injuries trigger a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This response involves the release of numerous inflammatory mediators, which dramatically increase systemic capillary permeability. This \"capillary leak\" allows for the translocation of intravascular fluid, proteins, and electrolytes into the interstitial space, a phenomenon known as \"third-spacing.\" The primary goal of fluid resuscitation is to replenish the depleted intravascular volume to maintain vital organ perfusion in the face of this massive fluid shift.\n\nHowever, the resuscitation fluid itself contributes to the problem. The large volumes of isotonic crystalloid (Lactated Ringer's solution) administered also leak into the interstitial space, contributing to generalized edema. When this third-spacing occurs in the abdominal cavity, it causes visceral edema (swelling of the bowel and mesentery) and retroperitoneal edema. Concurrently, the abdominal wall itself can become edematous, decreasing its compliance (i.e., its ability to stretch).\n\nAbdominal Compartment Syndrome is the endpoint of a process that begins with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). IAH is defined as a sustained increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). ACS occurs when elevated IAP leads to new organ dysfunction. The pathophysiology involves the increased volume of the abdominal contents (from visceral edema and ascites) within a less compliant abdominal container, leading to a dangerous rise in IAP. This pressure compresses intra-abdominal organs and vessels, impairing perfusion (e.g., leading to acute kidney injury, bowel ischemia) and venous return to the heart, and elevates the diaphragm, which compromises respiratory mechanics.\n\nLarge-volume resuscitation is a primary risk factor for the development of IAH and ACS, a phenomenon sometimes termed \"fluid creep.\" Comparing the two calculated volumes, the $18$ L from the Parkland formula represents a significantly greater fluid load than the $9$ L from the Modified Brooke formula. The resuscitation volume per unit mass is $V_{\\text{Parkland}}/m = 18 \\text{ L} / 90 \\text{ kg} = 0.2 \\text{ L/kg} = 200 \\text{ mL/kg}$ for the Parkland formula, versus $V_{\\text{ModBrooke}}/m = 9 \\text{ L} / 90 \\text{ kg} = 0.1 \\text{ L/kg} = 100 \\text{ mL/kg}$ for the Modified Brooke formula. The higher volume infusion associated with the Parkland formula directly translates to a greater potential for third-spacing, visceral edema, and consequently, a higher risk of developing IAH and ACS. While these formulas provide a crucial starting point, modern burn care emphasizes titrating fluid administration rates to physiological endpoints (such as urine output of $0.5 - 1.0$ mL/kg/hr) rather than strictly adhering to a calculated volume, precisely to mitigate the risk of over-resuscitation and its iatrogenic complications like ACS. The Modified Brooke formula, by starting with a lower volume, is inherently more conservative regarding this risk, but it may increase the risk of under-resuscitation if not monitored carefully.\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical difference between the Parkland and Modified Brooke $24$-hour volumes as requested.\n$$\\text{Difference} = V_{\\text{Parkland}} - V_{\\text{ModBrooke}}$$\n$$\\text{Difference} = 18 \\text{ L} - 9 \\text{ L} = 9 \\text{ L}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in liters and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Difference} = 9.000 \\text{ L}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.000}$$", "id": "4625392"}]}
