The use of geometric models (circles, ellipses) and specified margins ($4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ for a standard BCC on the trunk is common) is a fundamental aspect of surgical planning.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the dimensions of an elliptical excision designed to remove a circular lesion along with a uniform surgical margin.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Minor-Axis Width**\n\nLet $D$ be the diameter of the circular lesion. The radius of the lesion is $R = \\frac{D}{2}$.\nThe surgical plan requires a uniform margin of width $m$ to be excised around the entire periphery of the lesion. This means the total region to be removed is the original lesion plus this margin. Geometrically, this region is a larger, concentric circle.\n\nThe radius of this larger circle, let's call it $R_{total}$, is the sum of the lesion's radius and the margin width:\n$$R_{total} = R + m = \\frac{D}{2} + m$$\nThe diameter of this total region to be excised, $D_{total}$, is twice its radius:\n$$D_{total} = 2 R_{total} = 2 \\left( \\frac{D}{2} + m \\right) = D + 2m$$\nA fusiform (elliptical) excision must, at its widest point, encompass this entire diameter. This widest point of the ellipse corresponds to its minor axis. Therefore, the minor-axis width of the excision defect, which we shall denote as $W$, must be equal to the diameter of the lesion plus twice the margin.\n\nThe expression for the minor-axis width is:\n$$W = D + 2m$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Major-Axis Length**\n\nThe problem states that a standard $3{:}1$ ellipse design is used. This is a design rule relating the major axis length of the ellipse, denoted as $L$, to its minor axis width, $W$. The ratio is given as:\n$$\\frac{L}{W} = 3$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the major-axis length $L$ in terms of the minor-axis width $W$:\n$$L = 3W$$\nSubstituting the expression for $W$ derived in the previous step, we obtain the expression for the major-axis length in terms of the initial parameters $D$ and $m$:\n$$L = 3(D + 2m)$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the values $D = 7\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $m = 4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. We substitute these values into the derived expressions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the minor-axis width, $W$:\n$$W = 7\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 2(4\\,\\mathrm{mm})$$\n$$W = 7\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$W = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the major-axis length, $L$, using the calculated value of $W$:\n$$L = 3W = 3(15\\,\\mathrm{mm})$$\n$$L = 45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe value for the minor-axis width, $15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, expressed to three significant figures is $15.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe value for the major-axis length, $45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, expressed to three significant figures is $45.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe final answer consists of these two values, reported in millimeters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 15.0 & 45.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4648431"}, {"introduction": "The safe and effective administration of local anesthesia is a cornerstone of dermatologic and ambulatory surgery, underpinning the vast majority of procedures for non-melanoma skin cancer.
