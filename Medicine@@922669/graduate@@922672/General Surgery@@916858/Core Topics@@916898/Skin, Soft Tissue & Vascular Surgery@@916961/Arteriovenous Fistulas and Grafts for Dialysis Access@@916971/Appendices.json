It presents a standard clinical scenario analyzable with the principle of conservation of mass. All necessary data are provided, the values are physically consistent, and the question is unambiguous.\n\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the recirculation fraction, $R$, and compute its value. The recirculation fraction is defined as the fraction of blood entering the arterial line of the dialysis circuit that has been returned from the venous line without first passing through the systemic circulation.\n\nLet $Q_{b}$ be the total blood flow rate drawn into the arterial line by the blood pump. This flow is composed of two components: a flow of \"fresh\" systemic blood, $Q_{s}$, and a flow of recirculated blood, $Q_{r}$. By conservation of volume flow, we have:\n$$Q_{b} = Q_{s} + Q_{r}$$\n\nThe concentration of urea in the systemic blood is $C_{\\text{sys}}$, and the concentration in the recirculated blood (which is blood just exiting the dialyzer) is $C_{\\text{ven}}$. The mixture of these two flows results in the blood entering the arterial line with a concentration $C_{\\text{art}}$.\n\nApplying the principle of conservation of mass for the solute (urea) at the mixing point (the arterial needle inlet):\nThe mass flow rate of urea into the mixing point must equal the mass flow rate out of the mixing point.\n$$(\\text{Mass flow rate in}) = (\\text{Mass flow rate out})$$\n$$Q_{s} C_{\\text{sys}} + Q_{r} C_{\\text{ven}} = Q_{b} C_{\\text{art}}$$\n\nThe recirculation fraction, $R$, is defined by the ratio of the recirculated flow rate to the total blood pump flow rate:\n$$R = \\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{b}}$$\nOur goal is to express $R$ in terms of the measurable concentrations $C_{\\text{sys}}$, $C_{\\text{art}}$, and $C_{\\text{ven}}$.\n\nFrom the volume flow conservation equation, we can express $Q_{s}$ as $Q_{s} = Q_{b} - Q_{r}$.

The calculated value strongly suggests a severe access-related problem that is significantly compromising the efficiency of dialysis, which is consistent with the patient's low $Kt/V$ values. The most common reversible cause of such high recirculation is cannulation site error, where the arterial and venous needles are placed too close to one another, causing the cleaned blood from the venous needle to be short-circuited directly back into the arterial needle.
