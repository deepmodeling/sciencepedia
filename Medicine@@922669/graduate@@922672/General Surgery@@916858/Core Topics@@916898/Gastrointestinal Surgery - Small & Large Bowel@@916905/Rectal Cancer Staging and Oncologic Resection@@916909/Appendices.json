This practice challenges you to move beyond taking an imaging report at face value by applying a formal Bayesian framework to a common clinical problem.

[@problem_id:4662790]", "problem": "A patient with a mid-rectal adenocarcinoma is staged by high-resolution pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The shortest measured distance between the tumor and the mesorectal fascia (the surrogate for the potential circumferential resection margin, CRM) is reported as $X = 0.8$ millimeters (mm). In oncologic rectal surgery, a threatened circumferential resection margin is typically defined when the true shortest distance $d$ from tumor to mesorectal fascia is less than or equal to a threshold $c = 1$ mm, because such proximity is associated with a high risk of involved margin after Total Mesorectal Excision (TME), which undermines local control and survival. The principal preoperative strategies are:\n- Neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiation to improve the probability of an $R0$ resection (and facilitate sphincter preservation when appropriate), followed by TME (which may be performed as Low Anterior Resection (LAR) or Abdominoperineal Resection (APR) depending on sphincter involvement).\n- Immediate surgery-first TME without neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nTo connect the imaging measurement to decision-making, model the MRI as a noisy observation of the true distance $d$ with a Gaussian measurement model: $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(d, \\sigma^{2})$, where $\\sigma = 0.2$ mm reflects spatial resolution and segmentation variability.

The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess the circumferential resection margin (CRM) is standard practice. The values for distances ($0.8$ mm, $1$ mm) and the concept of a threatened margin are clinically realistic. The surgical terminology (TME, LAR, APR) is correct. Modeling measurement uncertainty with a Gaussian distribution and using a Bayesian framework to update belief about a true parameter ($d$) based on an observation ($X$) is a standard and robust methodology in medical imaging, biostatistics, and decision analysis. The choice of a uniform prior is a common, albeit simple, way to represent weakly informative prior knowledge. The problem is based on established scientific and statistical principles.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information—the observed data, the statistical model (likelihood and prior), and a clear decision rule with all a priori defined thresholds—to compute a unique, meaningful answer. The question is specific and calculable.\n\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It asks for a calculation based on a given model, not a subjective opinion on treatment strategy.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., factual unsoundness, vagueness, incompleteness, contradiction). It is a formalizable problem directly relevant to the specified topic, is internally consistent, and requires substantive reasoning to solve.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to determine the strategy code $S$ by first computing the posterior probability that the true distance $d$ is less than or equal to the critical threshold $c$, given the MRI measurement $X$. This is the probability $P(d \\leq c \\mid X)$.\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem for continuous variables. The posterior probability density function (PDF) for $d$, $f(d \\mid X)$, is proportional to the product of the likelihood function $f(X \\mid d)$ and the prior PDF $f(d)$.\n$$f(d \\mid X) \\propto f(X \\mid d) f(d)$$\n\nThe components of the model are:\n1.  **Likelihood Function**: The measurement model is given as $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(d, \\sigma^2)$, so the likelihood of observing $X$ for a given $d$ is:\n    $$f(X \\mid d) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(X - d)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\n2.  **Prior Distribution**: The prior belief about $d$ is a uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 5]$. The PDF is:\n    $$f(d) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{5-0} = \\frac{1}{5} & \\text{for } 0 \\leq d \\leq 5 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n\nCombining these, the unnormalized posterior PDF is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior, constrained to the support of the prior:\n$$f(d \\mid X) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(d - X)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq d \\leq 5$$\nThe posterior distribution is a truncated normal distribution.\n\nTo find the posterior probability $P(d \\leq c \\mid X)$, we must integrate the posterior PDF from $0$ to $c$. The normalization constant cancels out when we express this probability as a ratio of integrals:\n$$P(d \\leq c \\mid X) = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{c} f(d \\mid X) \\, dd}{\\int_{0}^{5} f(d \\mid X) \\, dd} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(d-X)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\, dd}{\\int_{0}^{5} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(d-X)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\, dd}$$\n\nThese integrals can be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z)$, where $\\Phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{z} \\exp(-t^2/2) \\, dt$. An integral of a Gaussian function $\\int_a^b \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y- \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) dy$ is equal to $\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma \\left[ \\Phi\\left(\\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\right]$.\nApplying this to our ratio, the constant factor $\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. Our probability becomes:\n$$P(d \\leq c \\mid X) = \\frac{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{c-X}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0-X}{\\sigma}\\right)}{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{5-X}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0-X}{\\sigma}\\right)}$$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $X = 0.8$, $c = 1$, and $\\sigma = 0.2$.\nThe arguments for the $\\Phi$ function are:\n-   For the numerator: $\\frac{c-X}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1 - 0.8}{0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{0.2} = 1$.\n-   For the denominator and numerator: $\\frac{0-X}{\\sigma} = \\frac{0 - 0.8}{0.2} = -4$.\n-   For the denominator: $\\frac{5-X}{\\sigma} = \\frac{5 - 0.8}{0.2} = \\frac{4.2}{0.2} = 21$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the posterior probability:\n$$P(d \\leq 1 \\mid X=0.8) = \\frac{\\Phi(1) - \\Phi(-4)}{\\Phi(21) - \\Phi(-4)}$$\n\nWe use standard values for the CDF $\\Phi(z)$:\n-   $\\Phi(1) \\approx 0.84134$\n-   $\\Phi(-4) = 1 - \\Phi(4) \\approx 1 - 0.9999683 = 3.17 \\times 10^{-5}$. This value is very close to $0$.\n-   $\\Phi(21)$ is extremely close to $1$. The probability of a standard normal variate exceeding $21$ is negligible. We can approximate $\\Phi(21) \\approx 1$.\n\nUsing these approximations:\n$$P(d \\leq 1 \\mid X=0.8) \\approx \\frac{0.84134 - 0.0000317}{1 - 0.0000317} = \\frac{0.8413083}{0.9999683} \\approx 0.84134$$\n\nThe decision rule states that neoadjuvant therapy is indicated if this probability is greater than or equal to the threshold $p_0 = 0.70$. We compare our result to this threshold:\n$$0.84134 \\geq 0.70$$\nThis inequality is true.\n\nAccording to the decision rule, the selected strategy is neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiation. The problem defines the strategy code $S = 1$ for this outcome.\n\nTherefore, the integer strategy code is $S=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4662790"}, {"introduction": "Following an oncologic resection, clinical decision-making shifts from surgical strategy to adjuvant therapy, guided by the definitive pathologic staging.

A formal solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in a stepwise manner as dictated by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we must determine the adequacy of the Circumferential Resection Margin (CRM). The measured CRM is given as $2$ mm. The definition for an adequate CRM is a measurement strictly greater than $1$ mm. We compare the measured value to this definition:\n$$\n2 \\, \\text{mm} > 1 \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nThe inequality is true, therefore the CRM is adequate.\n\nSecond, based on the CRM adequacy, we select the appropriate hazard factor, $H_{\\text{CRM}}$.

The number $0.144$ has three significant figures. To express it with four significant figures, we append a zero, yielding:\n$$\np_{\\text{chemo-only}} = 0.1440\n$$\n\nFourth, we apply the postoperative decision rule to determine the numeric decision code $D$.
