High-quality observational syntheses report that, relative to an optimized reference population undergoing the same operation without these exposures, prednisone at or above $20$ mg/day is associated with a relative risk (RR) for postoperative wound complications of $2.0$, and hypoalbuminemia below $3.0$ g/dL is associated with an RR of $1.5$.

Let $C_1$ be the event of being exposed to prednisone at a dose $\\ge 20$ mg/day, and let $C_2$ be the event of having hypoalbuminemia with serum albumin $ 3.0$ g/dL. The patient in question is subject to both exposures.\n\nThe absolute risk is defined as the probability of the event. We are given the absolute risk for the reference population (no exposures), which we denote as $R_0$:\n$$ R_0 = P(E | \\neg C_1 \\cap \\neg C_2) = 0.12 $$\n\nThe relative risk (RR) for an exposure is the ratio of the absolute risk in the exposed group to the absolute risk in the unexposed (reference) group. The problem provides the relative risks for each exposure individually.\nFor the prednisone exposure ($C_1$):\n$$ \\text{RR}_1 = \\frac{P(E | C_1 \\cap \\neg C_2)}{P(E | \\neg C_1 \\cap \\neg C_2)} = \\frac{P(E | C_1 \\cap \\neg C_2)}{R_0} = 2.0 $$\nFor the hypoalbuminemia exposure ($C_2$):\n$$ \\text{RR}_2 = \\frac{P(E | \\neg C_1 \\cap C_2)}{P(E | \\neg C_1 \\cap \\neg C_2)} = \\frac{P(E | \\neg C_1 \\cap C_2)}{R_0} = 1.5 $$\n\nWe are asked to find the absolute risk for the patient who has both exposures, which we denote as $R_{\\text{patient}}$:\n$$ R_{\\text{patient}} = P(E | C_1 \\cap C_2) $$\n\nThe problem states that the two exposures act \"independently on a multiplicative scale\". This is a specific term in epidemiology that defines how to combine relative risks. It posits that the relative risk of one exposure is not modified by the presence of the other. The combined relative risk of multiple independent exposures is the product of their individual relative risks.\n\nLet $\\text{RR}_{\\text{combined}}$ be the relative risk for a patient with both exposures compared to the reference population.\n$$ \\text{RR}_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{P(E | C_1 \\cap C_2)}{P(E | \\neg C_1 \\cap \\neg C_2)} = \\frac{R_{\\text{patient}}}{R_0} $$\n\nThe assumption of multiplicative independence implies:\n$$ \\text{RR}_{\\text{combined}} = \\text{RR}_1 \\times \\text{RR}_2 $$\n\nBy substituting the definitions, we obtain the expression for the patient's absolute risk:\n$$ \\frac{R_{\\text{patient}}}{R_0} = \\text{RR}_1 \\times \\text{RR}_2 $$\n\nSolving for $R_{\\text{patient}}$ gives the desired expression:\n$$ R_{\\text{patient}} = R_0 \\times \\text{RR}_1 \\times \\text{RR}_2 $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression to compute the patient's absolute risk.\nGiven:\n-   $R_0 = 0.12$\n-   $\\text{RR}_1 = 2.0$\n-   $\\text{RR}_2 = 1.5$\n\n$$ R_{\\text{patient}} = 0.12 \\times 2.0 \\times 1.5 $$\n$$ R_{\\text{patient}} = 0.12 \\times 3.0 $$\n$$ R_{\\text{patient}} = 0.36 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.36$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.360$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.360} $$", "id": "4675622"}, {"introduction": "Beyond preoperative planning, surgeons must expertly manage the physiological consequences of their operations.
