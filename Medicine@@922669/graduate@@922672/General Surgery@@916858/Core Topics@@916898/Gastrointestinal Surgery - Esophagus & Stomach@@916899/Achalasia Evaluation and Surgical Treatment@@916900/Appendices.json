The composite Eckardt score is defined as the unweighted sum of the four domain scores.

All definitions and scales provided are factually correct.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear definition for the quantity to be calculated (the composite score is the unweighted sum) and supplies all necessary input data (the scores for the four individual domains). A unique numerical solution can be determined.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language without ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any invalidating flaws. It is a straightforward application of a defined clinical scoring system, which is a formalizable and scientifically valid task.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the composite Eckardt score for a patient based on their individual domain scores. The definition provided states that the composite score is the unweighted sum of the scores from the four specified domains: dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss.\n\nLet $S_d$ be the score for dysphagia, $S_r$ be the score for regurgitation, $S_{cp}$ be the score for chest pain, and $S_{wl}$ be the score for weight loss. The composite Eckardt score, $E_{composite}$, is defined as:\n$$E_{composite} = S_d + S_r + S_{cp} + S_{wl}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following scores for the patient:\n-   $S_d = 3$\n-   $S_r = 2$\n-   $S_{cp} = 1$\n-   $S_{wl} = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the definitional equation yields the composite score:\n$$E_{composite} = 3 + 2 + 1 + 2$$\nPerforming the summation:\n$$E_{composite} = 8$$\n\nThe resulting composite Eckardt score is $8$. According to the severity bands provided in the problem statement ($0$–$3$ for mild, $4$–$6$ for moderate, $7$–$9$ for severe, and $10$–$12$ for very severe), a score of $8$ falls within the \"severe\" category.

High-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM) is the gold standard, and the integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) is its most critical metric for defining the impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation that characterizes the disease. This exercise simulates the analysis of raw manometric data to calculate the mean IRP, a key step in applying the Chicago Classification to confirm an achalasia diagnosis.", "problem": "A patient with suspected achalasia undergoes high-resolution esophageal manometry (High-Resolution Manometry, HRM). For the assessment of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, the integrated relaxation pressure (Integrated Relaxation Pressure, IRP) is measured over ten standardized wet swallows, yielding values (in millimeters of mercury): $[32, 28, 30, 35, 29, 33, 31, 27, 34, 29]$ mmHg.

It provides all necessary data (the ten IRP values) and a precise set of instructions for calculation (compute the mean), comparison (check against a threshold), and encoding the result. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the arithmetic mean of the provided Integrated Relaxation Pressure (IRP) values. Let the set of $n=10$ measurements be denoted by $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{10}\\}$, where the values are:\n$$X = \\{32, 28, 30, 35, 29, 33, 31, 27, 34, 29\\}$$\n\nThe arithmetic mean, denoted as $\\overline{\\text{IRP}}$, is calculated using the formula provided:\n$$\\overline{\\text{IRP}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$\n\nFirst, we compute the sum of the observations, $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i = 32 + 28 + 30 + 35 + 29 + 33 + 31 + 27 + 34 + 29$$\nSumming these values yields:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i = 308$$\n\nNext, we divide this sum by the number of observations, $n=10$:\n$$\\overline{\\text{IRP}} = \\frac{308}{10} = 30.8$$\nThe resulting mean IRP is $30.8$ mmHg. The problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $30.8$ already consists of three significant figures ($3$, $0$, and $8$), so no further rounding is necessary. The value for the first entry of the final answer is $30.8$.\n\nThe second task is to determine the exceedance indicator, $E$. This indicator is based on a comparison of the calculated mean IRP with the given upper limit of normal, which is $T = 15$ mmHg. The rule is:\n$$E = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } \\overline{\\text{IRP}}  15 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } \\overline{\\text{IRP}} \\le 15 \\end{cases}$$\nWe compare our calculated mean, $\\overline{\\text{IRP}} = 30.8$, to the threshold $T = 15$:\n$$30.8 > 15$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the mean IRP exceeds the upper limit. According to the specified encoding, the exceedance indicator is $E=1$.\n\nThe final answer is to be provided as a row matrix containing two entries: the rounded mean IRP and the exceedance indicator. The two entries are $30.8$ and $1$.
