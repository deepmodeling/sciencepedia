Proceeding with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem instructs us to model the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) as a thin-walled cylinder. The relationship between the pressure difference across the wall of such a cylinder, $\\Delta P$, the circumferential wall tension, $T$ (defined as force per unit length), and the radius of the cylinder, $r$, is given by the Law of Laplace for a cylinder:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{T}{r} $$\nIn this context, the \"closing pressure\" of the EGJ is the pressure exerted by the sphincter and surrounding structures, which corresponds to the transmural pressure difference $\\Delta P$. Let us denote the total inspiratory EGJ closing pressure as $P_{\\mathrm{EGJ}}$.\n\nThe total wall tension, $T_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is generated by two sources: the intrinsic tone of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), creating tension $T_{\\mathrm{LES}}$, and the extrinsic compression from the crural diaphragm, creating tension $T_{\\mathrm{crura}}$. The problem states that these tensions superpose linearly. Therefore, the total circumferential tension is the sum of the individual tensions:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{total}} = T_{\\mathrm{LES}} + T_{\\mathrm{crura}} $$\nThe total inspiratory EGJ pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{EGJ}}$, can be expressed using Laplace's law with the total tension:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EGJ}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{total}}}{r} $$\nwhere $r$ is the effective radius of the EGJ.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the total tension into the pressure equation, we get:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EGJ}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{LES}} + T_{\\mathrm{crura}}}{r} $$\nThis expression can be separated into two terms:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EGJ}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{LES}}}{r} + \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{crura}}}{r} $$\nThe problem provides values for pressure contributions from each component: the basal LES pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{LES}}$, and the inspiratory crural diaphragmatic contribution, $P_{\\mathrm{crura}}$. We must relate these given pressures to the terms in our derived equation. The pressure generated by the LES alone is given by Laplace's law applied to its tension component:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{LES}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{LES}}}{r} $$\nSimilarly, the pressure contribution from the crural diaphragm is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{crura}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{crura}}}{r} $$\nThis step is justified by the explicit assumption that both contributors act at the same effective radius $r$.\n\nBy substituting these definitions back into the equation for the total EGJ pressure, we arrive at the final expression for the total inspiratory closing pressure:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EGJ}} = P_{\\mathrm{LES}} + P_{\\mathrm{crura}} $$\nThis derivation demonstrates that under the stated assumptions, the total pressure is the simple arithmetic sum of the individual pressure contributions.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $P_{\\mathrm{LES}} = 8\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\mathrm{crura}} = 12\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EGJ}} = 8\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} + 12\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 20\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\n\nAn additional assumption, which is implicit but critical, is that the effective radius $r$ of the EGJ segment is constant and does not change as the tension increases from the basal state (LES only) to the inspiratory state (LES plus crura). This is a simplification, as biological tissues are compliant and would likely exhibit a change in radius under varying tension. However, the problem's framing (\"both contributors act at the same effective radius\") directs us to use this simplifying assumption. We also assume that the clinically measured pressures $P_{\\mathrm{LES}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{crura}}$ correspond directly to the transmural pressures in the Laplace model.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{20} $$", "id": "4627270"}, {"introduction": "Clinical observation strongly links obesity to GERD, but understanding the precise mechanism requires quantifying the forces involved.

The information about the patient's BMI changing from $25$ to $40$ provides the clinical context for why the intraabdominal pressure increased. The information that the intrinsic LES pressure remains constant is important for the overall clinical picture (it implies the barrier to reflux is not strengthening to compensate for the increased driving force), but it is not needed to calculate the change in the driving force, which is what the question specifically asks for.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "4627310"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static pressure gradients, a major cause of reflux is the dynamic failure of the LES through events known as transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs).
