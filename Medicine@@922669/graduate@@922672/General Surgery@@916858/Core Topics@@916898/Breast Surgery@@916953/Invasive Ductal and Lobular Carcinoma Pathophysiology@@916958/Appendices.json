The gene $\\mathrm{CDH1}$ encodes the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. Biallelic inactivation of $\\mathrm{CDH1}$ through mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is the canonical molecular event defining invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast. The other genetic markers ($\\mathrm{PIK3CA}$, $\\mathrm{TP53}$, $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$) are standard prognostic and predictive markers used in breast cancer classification. The histopathologic description is consistent with the expected phenotype. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a specific set of molecular and histologic data and asks for the most likely diagnosis and mechanism. The provided information is sufficient and internally consistent, allowing for a unique and logical deduction based on established genotype-phenotype correlations in breast cancer.\n-   **Objective**: The problem uses precise, objective terminology from the fields of genetics and pathology (e.g., \"loss of heterozygosity,\" \"frameshift truncating mutation,\" \"infiltrating fibrous stroma\"). There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a logical solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n## DERIVATION OF SOLUTION\n\nThe problem requires a deduction of the breast cancer subtype and its invasion mechanism from fundamental principles of cell biology and the provided genetic and histologic data.\n\n1.  **Principle of Epithelial Adhesion**: Normal epithelial cells are held together in organized sheets by various cell-cell junctions. The most critical for maintaining tissue integrity are the adherens junctions. The primary protein component of adherens junctions is E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein. E-cadherin molecules from adjacent cells bind to each other, creating a strong intercellular \"zipper\". Intracellularly, E-cadherin is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via a complex of proteins called catenins. This entire complex is essential for cohesive epithelial structure and for suppressing cell motility and invasion.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Genetic Findings**:\n    *   **$\\mathrm{CDH1}$ Gene**: The $\\mathrm{CDH1}$ gene, located on chromosome $16q22.1$, is the gene that codes for the E-cadherin protein. It functions as a tumor suppressor gene.\n    *   **Biallelic Inactivation of $\\mathrm{CDH1}$**: The patient's tumor exhibits two distinct genetic events affecting $\\mathrm{CDH1}$, following the Knudson \"two-hit\" hypothesis for tumor suppressor gene inactivation:\n        1.  A **frameshift truncating mutation** in one allele. This mutation will lead to the production of a non-functional, truncated protein or to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA, effectively resulting in a null allele.\n        2.  **Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome $16q$**: This event results in the loss of the second, presumably wild-type, allele of the $\\mathrm{CDH1}$ gene.\n    *   **Functional Consequence**: The combination of these two \"hits\" leads to the complete absence of functional E-cadherin protein in the tumor cells. This is termed biallelic inactivation.\n\n3.  **Phenotypic Inference from E-cadherin Loss**:\n    *   **Loss of Cohesion**: Without functional E-cadherin, the adherens junctions cannot form properly. The tumor cells lose their ability to adhere to one another. This results in a discohesive phenotype.\n    *   **Invasion Mechanism**: The dissociated, non-cohesive cells are free to migrate individually or in small, disconnected groups through the stromal matrix. This pattern of invasion is characteristically described as \"single-file\" or \"Indian file\" infiltration. The cells often encircle native breast ducts in a concentric pattern, known as \"targetoid\" growth.\n    *   **Histologic Subtype**: The breast cancer subtype defined by the loss of E-cadherin and the resultant discohesive, single-file infiltrative growth pattern is **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)**. The provided histologic description—\"malignant epithelial cells infiltrating fibrous stroma without overt tubule formation\"—is fully consistent with ILC, as the lack of cohesion prevents the formation of glandular or tubular structures characteristic of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC).\n\n4.  **Relevance of Other Genetic Findings**:\n    *   **$\\mathrm{PIK3CA}$ $\\mathrm{H}1047\\mathrm{R}$ mutation**: This is an activating mutation in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, a common event in hormone receptor-positive breast cancers, including both ILC and IDC. It promotes cell growth and survival but is not specific to the histologic subtype. Its presence is compatible with ILC.\n    *   **No $\\mathrm{TP53}$ mutation**: $\\mathrm{TP53}$ mutations are associated with higher-grade and more aggressive tumors. The absence of a $\\mathrm{TP53}$ mutation is consistent with the typically lower-grade nature of classic ILC.\n    *   **No $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$ amplification**: This rules out an $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$-positive diagnosis. Most ILCs ($>90\\%$) are $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$-negative.\n\n**Conclusion**: The biallelic inactivation of $\\mathrm{CDH1}$ is the determinative finding, leading to a loss of E-cadherin. This directly causes the discohesive phenotype and single-file invasion pattern characteristic of Invasive Lobular Carcinoma, classic type.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC), classic type; mechanism: discohesive single-file infiltration with targetoid growth around ducts due to loss of E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions**\nThis option correctly identifies the histologic subtype as ILC, which is the direct consequence of $\\mathrm{CDH1}$/E-cadherin loss. It accurately describes the invasion mechanism as discohesive single-file infiltration and correctly attributes it to the loss of E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions. This aligns perfectly with the first-principles derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) of no special type; mechanism: cohesive nests and tubule formation in a desmoplastic stroma driven by intact E-cadherin-mediated adhesion**\nThis option is incorrect. IDC is characterized by cohesive growth (forming ducts, nests, or sheets), which requires functional E-cadherin. The genetic data explicitly shows biallelic inactivation of $\\mathrm{CDH1}$, meaning E-cadherin function is lost, not intact. The histologic description in the problem (\"without overt tubule formation\") also argues against IDC.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Invasive micropapillary carcinoma; mechanism: tight cohesive clusters within stromal lacunar spaces showing inside-out polarity due to apical $\\mathrm{MUC1}$ inversion, typically with $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$ amplification**\nThis option is incorrect. Invasive micropapillary carcinoma is a subtype of IDC characterized by cohesive clusters of cells. It is, by definition, an E-cadherin-positive tumor. This contradicts the genetic findings. Furthermore, the problem explicitly states there is no $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$ amplification, which contradicts the typical association mentioned in the option.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Medullary carcinoma; mechanism: syncytial sheets with pushing borders and prominent tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, associated with $\\mathrm{BRCA1}$ dysfunction and $\\mathrm{TP53}$ mutation**\nThis option is incorrect. Medullary carcinoma is characterized by a syncytial (cohesive) growth pattern, not single-file infiltration. It is also strongly associated with $\\mathrm{TP53}$ mutations, which are explicitly absent in this case.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma; mechanism: solid sheets with marked nuclear pleomorphism, retained E-cadherin, and frequent $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$ overexpression**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (PLC) is a variant of ILC and is also defined by the loss of E-cadherin. The claim of \"retained E-cadherin\" is fundamentally wrong and contradicts the primary genetic finding. The problem also states no $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$ amplification, contradicting the claim of \"frequent $\\mathrm{ERBB2}$ overexpression\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4634943"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational genotype-phenotype link, this advanced case study explores the reality of tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution.

You are asked to infer clonal relationships and propose a mechanistic model for phenotypic divergence from a common ancestor using only fundamental principles: the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), the definition of a tumor suppressor gene and Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis, the concept of clonal evolution with truncal versus branch alterations, and the biology of adherens junctions in which E-cadherin (encoded by CDH1) recruits catenins to maintain cell–cell adhesion.

E-cadherin immunohistochemistry (IHC) is strongly membranous. p120-catenin is membranous.\n- Region $2$ shows discohesive single-file infiltration consistent with lobular morphology.

No lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is identified.\n\nTargeted sequencing of microdissected regions reports the following:\n- Estimated tumor cell content (purity) by allele-based analysis: Region $1$ $p_1 = 0.70$, Region $2$ $p_2 = 0.90$, Region $3$ $p_3 = 0.75$.\n- All three regions share PIK3CA p.E545K and a GATA3 frameshift with variant allele fractions (VAFs) of approximately $0.34$ (Region $1$), $0.46$ (Region $2$), and $0.37$ (Region $3$) for PIK3CA, with similar VAFs for GATA3.\n- Arm-level copy-number alterations: gain of chromosome $1$q in Regions $1$, $2$, and $3$.

In Regions $2$ and $3$, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis supports loss of heterozygosity across chromosome $16$q. No CDH1 promoter methylation is detected in Region $1$; focal promoter hypermethylation is detected in Region $3$.\n\nUsing the bases listed above and the observations provided, which clonal and mechanistic model most parsimoniously explains the data, including the histologic divergence and the heterogeneous E-cadherin expression?\n\nA. A single ancestral clone with truncal PIK3CA and GATA3 alterations underwent branched evolution: one branch retained intact CDH1 and remained ductal (Region $1$), while a separate branch acquired loss of chromosome $16$q and a truncating CDH1 mutation (biallelic inactivation via loss of heterozygosity) producing E-cadherin loss and p120-catenin cytoplasmic mislocalization (Region $2$); Region $3$ represents a transitional subclone with partial CDH1 inactivation (mixture of loss of heterozygosity and focal promoter hypermethylation), yielding aberrant E-cadherin localization.\n\nB.

Linear evolution from a lobular ancestor: early biallelic CDH1 inactivation generated a lobular carcinoma that later reacquired E-cadherin expression through reversal of promoter methylation, restoring cohesive ductal morphology in Region $1$ while retaining the same trunk alterations.\n\nD. Phenotypic plasticity via epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) without genomic CDH1 lesions: reversible transcriptional downregulation of E-cadherin explains the lobular morphology in Regions $2$ and $3$, whereas the ductal area reflects mesenchymal–epithelial transition; the observed CDH1 mutation is a passenger without functional consequence.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a clonal and mechanistic model for the histologic divergence observed in a mixed invasive ductal–lobular carcinoma, based on provided histopathological, immunophenotypical, and genomic data. The derivation must adhere to fundamental principles of molecular biology, cancer genetics, and cell biology.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe problem statement has been evaluated for validity.\n\n*   **Givens Extraction**: All data points, including histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor purity estimations ($p_1 = 0.70$, $p_2 = 0.90$, $p_3 = 0.75$), variant allele fractions (VAFs) for `PIK3CA`, `GATA3`, and `CDH1`, and copy-number/epigenetic alterations, have been extracted.\n*   **Validation against Criteria**:\n    1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of cancer biology, including clonal evolution, tumor suppressor gene inactivation (Knudson hypothesis), and the molecular basis of cell adhesion via E-cadherin. The data and concepts are factually sound and representative of modern oncologic pathology.\n    2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-defined, providing a comprehensive dataset and asking for the most parsimonious explanatory model. A unique, logical solution can be derived.\n    3.  **Objective**: The problem uses precise, technical language and quantitative data, devoid of subjectivity.\n    4.  **Internal Consistency**: The provided VAFs, purities, and copy number data are internally consistent. For example, in Region $2$ (purity $p_2=0.90$), the `CDH1` mutation VAF is $0.82$. Given the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome $16$q, the expected VAF for a clonal heterozygous mutation where the wild-type allele is lost is $VAF = \\frac{p \\times 1}{p \\times 1 + (1-p) \\times 2} = \\frac{0.90}{0.90 + 2 \\times 0.10} = \\frac{0.90}{1.10} \\approx 0.818$. The observed VAF of $0.82$ is in excellent agreement, confirming the model of biallelic inactivation via mutation and LOH. Similar checks for other data points confirm their consistency.\n    5.  **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained and provides sufficient information to construct and evaluate the proposed models.\n\n*   **Verdict**: The problem is **valid** and suitable for solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Clonal Model\n\nThe solution is derived by synthesizing the provided data using the specified first principles.\n\n1.  **Monoclonal Origin and Truncal Events**:\n    All three regions ($1$, $2$, and $3$) share `PIK3CA` p.E545K and `GATA3` frameshift mutations, as well as a gain of chromosome $1$q. To assess if these are truncal events (present in the common ancestor of all tumor cells), we can estimate the cancer cell fraction (CCF). For a heterozygous mutation in a diploid region, $CCF \\approx 2 \\times VAF / p$.\n    *   Region 1: $CCF_{PIK3CA} \\approx 2 \\times 0.34 / 0.70 \\approx 0.97$\n    *   Region 2: $CCF_{PIK3CA} \\approx 2 \\times 0.46 / 0.90 \\approx 1.02$\n    *   Region 3: $CCF_{PIK3CA} \\approx 2 \\times 0.37 / 0.75 \\approx 0.99$\n    The CCFs are all approximately $1.0$, indicating that these mutations are present in nearly every cancer cell across all three regions. This provides strong evidence for a single ancestral clone (monoclonal origin) that harbored these alterations. The presence of E-cadherin-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) suggests this ancestral clone likely arose from a ductal lineage.\n\n2.  **Branched Evolution**:\n    The regions exhibit distinct genetic and phenotypic profiles, demonstrating branched evolution from the common ancestor.\n    *   **Region 1 (Ductal Phenotype)**: This region retains the truncal alterations but lacks the additional key changes seen in the other regions. Specifically, it has no `CDH1` mutation and no loss of chromosome $16$q. According to the Central Dogma, an intact `CDH1` gene allows for transcription and translation of functional E-cadherin protein. This is consistent with the IHC finding of strong, membranous E-cadherin. As per adherens junction biology, functional E-cadherin recruits p120-catenin to the membrane. This matches the observed membranous p120-catenin localization. The resulting strong cell–cell adhesion produces the cohesive, ductal morphology. This region represents the baseline phenotype of the ancestral clone's lineage.\n\n    *   **Region 2 (Lobular Phenotype)**: This region evolved from a subclone that acquired additional alterations. It exhibits both a truncating `CDH1` frameshift mutation and loss of chromosome $16$q (LOH). The `CDH1` gene, a tumor suppressor, is located on chromosome $16$q. These two events constitute the two \"hits\" of Knudson's hypothesis, leading to biallelic inactivation of `CDH1`.\n        *   Hit 1: Truncating frameshift mutation on one `CDH1` allele.\n        *   Hit 2: Loss of the other chromosome $16$q, which carries the wild-type `CDH1` allele (LOH).\n        This complete loss of functional `CDH1` gene copies means no E-cadherin protein can be produced. This explains the absence of E-cadherin by IHC. Consequently, p120-catenin is not recruited to the membrane and mislocalizes to the cytoplasm. The loss of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion leads to the discohesive, single-file infiltration pattern characteristic of lobular carcinoma.\n\n    *   **Region 3 (Mixed/Transitional Phenotype)**: This region shares the defining alterations of the lobular branch (loss of $16q$ and the `CDH1` truncating mutation) but presents a heterogeneous phenotype. The E-cadherin IHC is attenuated and aberrantly localized (cytoplasmic puncta, incomplete membranes), and the p120-catenin staining is mixed. This suggests incomplete or heterogeneous inactivation of `CDH1` at the protein level.\n        The genetic data provides an explanation. The `CDH1` mutation VAF ($0.52$ in a $75\\%$ pure sample) is lower than the expected clonal VAF of $0.60$ (calculated as $0.75 / (0.75 + 2 \\times 0.25)$), suggesting the mutation is subclonal within this region (present in a large fraction, but not all, of the tumor cells). The problem also notes focal `CDH1` promoter hypermethylation in this region. Promoter hypermethylation is an epigenetic mechanism that can silence gene expression, serving as an alternative \"second hit\".\n        Therefore, Region $3$ likely represents a heterogeneous mixture of subclones:\n        a) Cells with `CDH1` mutation + LOH (functionally like Region 2).\n        b) Potentially, cells with LOH + `CDH1` promoter hypermethylation as the two hits.\n        This mosaic of `CDH1` inactivation mechanisms within the same geographic region leads to the observed mixed morphology and the attenuated/aberrant E-cadherin IHC pattern, representing a transitional state.\n\n**Summary Model**: A single ancestral clone (`PIK3CA` mut, `GATA3` mut, $1$q gain) with a ductal phenotype gives rise to two main branches. One branch (Region $1$) continues as a ductal carcinoma. The other branch acquires LOH of $16q$ and subsequently diversifies, with one sub-branch (Region $2$) undergoing a `CDH1` mutation to become a classic lobular carcinoma, and another (Region $3$) exhibiting a mix of inactivation mechanisms (`CDH1` mutation, promoter methylation), resulting in a transitional, heterogeneous phenotype.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. A single ancestral clone with truncal PIK3CA and GATA3 alterations underwent branched evolution: one branch retained intact CDH1 and remained ductal (Region 1), while a separate branch acquired loss of chromosome 16q and a truncating CDH1 mutation (biallelic inactivation via loss of heterozygosity) producing E-cadherin loss and p120-catenin cytoplasmic mislocalization (Region 2); Region 3 represents a transitional subclone with partial CDH1 inactivation (mixture of loss of heterozygosity and focal promoter hypermethylation), yielding aberrant E-cadherin localization.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This statement perfectly recapitulates the model derived from first principles and the comprehensive dataset. It correctly identifies the shared ancestry, truncal events, branched evolution, the specific two-hit mechanism for `CDH1` inactivation in Region $2$ and its consequences, and provides a cogent explanation for the heterogeneous, transitional nature of Region $3$ by incorporating all relevant data points (LOH, mutation, methylation).\n    *   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Two independent primary tumors (one ductal and one lobular) arose synchronously and collided; the shared hotspot PIK3CA mutation and GATA3 frameshift reflect coincidental convergence on common drivers rather than shared ancestry.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This \"collision tumor\" hypothesis is exceedingly non-parsimonious. The probability of two independent tumors coincidentally acquiring the exact same `PIK3CA` mutation, a `GATA3` frameshift, *and* a gain of chromosome $1$q is virtually zero. The shared, complex genomic fingerprint is definitive evidence of monoclonality.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Linear evolution from a lobular ancestor: early biallelic CDH1 inactivation generated a lobular carcinoma that later reacquired E-cadherin expression through reversal of promoter methylation, restoring cohesive ductal morphology in Region 1 while retaining the same trunk alterations.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This model posits that `CDH1` inactivation was an early, truncal event. This is contradicted by the data, as Region $1$ has intact, functional `CDH1`. Furthermore, Region $1$ does not have a `CDH1` mutation or promoter methylation to \"reverse\"; its `CDH1` gene and chromosome $16$q are wild-type. The model inverts the most likely evolutionary trajectory (ductal-to-lobular transition being more common than the reverse) and is inconsistent with the genetic status of Region $1$.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Phenotypic plasticity via epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) without genomic CDH1 lesions: reversible transcriptional downregulation of E-cadherin explains the lobular morphology in Regions 2 and 3, whereas the ductal area reflects mesenchymal–epithelial transition; the observed CDH1 mutation is a passenger without functional consequence.**\n    *   **Analysis**: This model disregards crucial genomic data. It incorrectly claims \"without genomic `CDH1` lesions\" when a truncating frameshift mutation and LOH are explicitly reported. Declaring a truncating mutation in a key tumor suppressor gene a \"passenger\" is unjustifiable, especially when its presence perfectly correlates with the loss of its protein product and the expected downstream cellular phenotype. While EMT is a valid biological process, this option's premise is directly falsified by the provided sequencing results.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4634945"}, {"introduction": "Pathological diagnosis often involves integrating multiple pieces of evidence to arrive at a conclusion.

This means $P(E_{cad} \\cap E_{p120} | \\text{Class}) = P(E_{cad} | \\text{Class}) \\times P(E_{p120} | \\text{Class})$.\n-   The problem explicitly states to use only the E-cadherin and p120-catenin results for the model, disregarding other provided IHC results ($\\text{ER}^{+}$, $\\text{PR}^{+}$, $\\text{HER}2^{-}$, $\\text{GATA}3^{+}$).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is set in a realistic medical context of breast pathology. The distinction between ILC and IDC using E-cadherin and p120-catenin IHC is a standard diagnostic procedure. Loss of E-cadherin is a defining molecular feature of ILC. The provided sensitivity and specificity values are clinically plausible. The use of Bayes' theorem is the correct mathematical framework for updating diagnostic probability. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary components—priors, conditional probabilities (sensitivities and specificities), and a clear assumption of conditional independence—to calculate the desired quantity, the posterior odds. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It gives numerical data and formal assumptions, avoiding ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in applied probability. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior odds of ILC versus IDC, given the evidence $E$, which is the observation of both E-cadherin loss ($E_{cad}$) and p120-catenin cytoplasmic mislocalization ($E_{p120}$). The posterior odds are defined as the ratio of the posterior probabilities:\n$$ \\text{odds}(\\text{ILC}:\\text{IDC} | E) = \\frac{P(\\text{ILC} | E)}{P(\\text{IDC} | E)} $$\nwhere $E = E_{cad} \\cap E_{p120}$.\n\nWe start from Bayes' theorem for each posterior probability:\n$$ P(\\text{ILC} | E) = \\frac{P(E | \\text{ILC}) P(\\text{ILC})}{P(E)} $$\n$$ P(\\text{IDC} | E) = \\frac{P(E | \\text{IDC}) P(\\text{IDC})}{P(E)} $$\nDividing the first equation by the second cancels the marginal probability of the evidence, $P(E)$, and yields the odds form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\frac{P(\\text{ILC} | E)}{P(\\text{IDC} | E)} = \\frac{P(E | \\text{ILC})}{P(E | \\text{IDC})} \\times \\frac{P(\\text{ILC})}{P(\\text{IDC})} $$\nThis equation can be expressed conceptually as:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Bayes Factor} \\times \\text{Prior Odds} $$\nThe Bayes Factor, also known as the likelihood ratio for the combined evidence, is $BF = \\frac{P(E | \\text{ILC})}{P(E | \\text{IDC})}$. The prior odds are $\\frac{P(\\text{ILC})}{P(\\text{IDC})}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior odds using the given prior probabilities:\n$$ \\text{Prior Odds} = \\frac{P(\\text{ILC})}{P(\\text{IDC})} = \\frac{0.15}{1 - 0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the Bayes Factor. The evidence $E$ is the conjunction of two events, $E_{cad}$ and $E_{p120}$. The problem states that these tests are conditionally independent given the histologic class. This allows us to write:\n$$ P(E | \\text{ILC}) = P(E_{cad} \\cap E_{p120} | \\text{ILC}) = P(E_{cad} | \\text{ILC}) \\times P(E_{p120} | \\text{ILC}) $$\n$$ P(E | \\text{IDC}) = P(E_{cad} \\cap E_{p120} | \\text{IDC}) = P(E_{cad} | \\text{IDC}) \\times P(E_{p120} | \\text{IDC}) $$\nSubstituting these into the Bayes Factor expression gives:\n$$ BF = \\frac{P(E_{cad} | \\text{ILC}) \\times P(E_{p120} | \\text{ILC})}{P(E_{cad} | \\text{IDC}) \\times P(E_{p120} | \\text{IDC})} = \\left( \\frac{P(E_{cad} | \\text{ILC})}{P(E_{cad} | \\text{IDC})} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{P(E_{p120} | \\text{ILC})}{P(E_{p120} | \\text{IDC})} \\right) $$\nThis shows that for conditionally independent tests, the total Bayes Factor is the product of the individual likelihood ratios for each test. Let's calculate these individual likelihood ratios, $LR_{cad}$ and $LR_{p120}$.\n\nFor the E-cadherin test ($E_{cad}$):\nThe numerator is the sensitivity for ILC, which is given as $P(E_{cad} | \\text{ILC}) = 0.90$.\nThe denominator is the probability of a positive test given IDC, which is $1$ minus the specificity. Specificity is defined as $P(\\neg E_{cad} | \\text{IDC}) = 0.95$.\nThus, $P(E_{cad} | \\text{IDC}) = 1 - P(\\neg E_{cad} | \\text{IDC}) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive E-cadherin test is:\n$$ LR_{cad} = \\frac{P(E_{cad} | \\text{ILC})}{P(E_{cad} | \\text{IDC})} = \\frac{0.90}{0.05} = 18 $$\n\nFor the p120-catenin test ($E_{p120}$):\nThe numerator is the sensitivity for ILC, given as $P(E_{p120} | \\text{ILC}) = 0.85$.\nThe denominator is $1$ minus the specificity, where specificity is $P(\\neg E_{p120}|\\text{IDC}) = 0.90$.\nThus, $P(E_{p120} | \\text{IDC}) = 1 - P(\\neg E_{p120} | \\text{IDC}) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive p120-catenin test is:\n$$ LR_{p120} = \\frac{P(E_{p120} | \\text{ILC})}{P(E_{p120} | \\text{IDC})} = \\frac{0.85}{0.10} = 8.5 $$\n\nNow, we can compute the overall posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times LR_{cad} \\times LR_{p120} $$\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\left(\\frac{0.15}{0.85}\\right) \\times 18 \\times 8.5 $$\nTo simplify the calculation, we can rewrite the expression:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\frac{0.15 \\times 18 \\times 8.5}{0.85} $$\nThe term $\\frac{8.5}{0.85}$ simplifies to $10$.\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = 0.15 \\times 18 \\times 10 = 1.5 \\times 18 $$\n$$ 1.5 \\times 18 = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times 18 = 18 + \\frac{18}{2} = 18 + 9 = 27 $$\n\nAlternatively, simplifying fractions:\n$$ \\text{Prior Odds} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{17 \\times 5} = \\frac{3}{17} $$\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\frac{3}{17} \\times 18 \\times 8.5 = \\frac{3 \\times 18 \\times 8.5}{17} $$\nSince $8.5 \\times 2 = 17$, the term $\\frac{8.5}{17}$ simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}$, or $0.5$.\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = 3 \\times 18 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3 \\times 9 = 27 $$\nThe posterior odds for ILC versus IDC are $27$ to $1$. This indicates that given the evidence, ILC is $27$ times more likely than IDC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{27}$$", "id": "4634962"}]}
