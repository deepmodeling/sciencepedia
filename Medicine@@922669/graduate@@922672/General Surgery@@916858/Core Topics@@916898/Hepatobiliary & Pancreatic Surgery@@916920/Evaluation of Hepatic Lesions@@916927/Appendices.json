It presents a standard biophysical modeling problem in medical imaging with realistic clinical context and data. All necessary information is provided, and the tasks are clearly defined and solvable.\n\nThe problem is based on the monoexponential model for signal attenuation in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI), which is given as:\n$$S(b) = S_{0}\\exp(-b \\cdot ADC)$$\nwhere $S(b)$ is the measured signal intensity at a given diffusion weighting $b$-value, $S_0$ is the theoretical signal intensity at a $b$-value of $0\\,\\mathrm{s/mm^2}$, and $ADC$ is the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient. The $ADC$ quantifies the magnitude of water molecule diffusion within a tissue voxel.\n\nWe are given two data points, ($b_1, S_1$) and ($b_2, S_2$), where $S_1 = S(b_1)$ and $S_2 = S(b_2)$. We can write the model equation for each point:\n$$S_1 = S_{0}\\exp(-b_1 \\cdot ADC)$$\n$$S_2 = S_{0}\\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC)$$\nTo derive an expression for the $ADC$, we must first eliminate the unknown variable $S_0$. This is accomplished by taking the ratio of the two equations:\n$$\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = \\frac{S_{0}\\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC)}{S_{0}\\exp(-b_1 \\cdot ADC)}$$\nThe $S_0$ terms cancel, and using the property of exponents $\\exp(x)/\\exp(y) = \\exp(x-y)$, we get:\n$$\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = \\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC - (-b_1 \\cdot ADC)) = \\exp(-(b_2 - b_1) \\cdot ADC)$$\nTo solve for $ADC$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides, which is the inverse operation of the exponential function:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_2}{S_1}\\right) = -(b_2 - b_1) \\cdot ADC$$\nFinally, we isolate $ADC$ by dividing by $-(b_2 - b_1)$:\n$$ADC = -\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_2}{S_1}\\right)}{b_2 - b_1}$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $-\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(y/x)$, we can write the expression in a more convenient form that avoids a leading negative sign:\n$$ADC = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_1}{S_2}\\right)}{b_2 - b_1}$$\nThis is the general expression for $ADC$ derived from two signal measurements.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The problem provides:\n- $b_1 = 50\\,\\mathrm{s/mm^2}$ with signal $S_1 = 980$.\n- $b_2 = 800\\,\\mathrm{s/mm^2}$ with signal $S_2 = 500$.\n\nThe units for the signals are arbitrary but consistent, so they cancel in the ratio. The units for the $b$-values are $\\mathrm{s/mm^2}$, so the resulting units for $ADC$ will be $\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$.\n$$ADC = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{980}{500}\\right)}{800 - 50} = \\frac{\\ln(1.96)}{750}\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{mm^2}{s}}$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$\\ln(1.96) \\approx 0.672944$$\n$$ADC \\approx \\frac{0.672944}{750}\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{mm^2}{s}} \\approx 0.000897259\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{mm^2}{s}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ADC \\approx 0.000897\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{mm^2}{s}}$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $8.97 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$.\n\nFinally, we must comment on the clinical significance of this value. The computed $ADC$ is $0.897 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$. In the context of solid hepatic lesions:\n- **Malignant metastases**, particularly from adenocarcinomas, are typically highly cellular tumors. This high cellularity, with large nuclei and scant cytoplasm, restricts the random motion (diffusion) of water molecules. This restriction results in a low $ADC$ value, generally considered to be less than $1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$.\n- **Benign hemangiomas** are composed of large, blood-filled vascular spaces with very slow-moving blood. This environment allows for relatively unrestricted diffusion of water molecules, resulting in a high $ADC$ value, typically much greater than $2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$.\n\nThe calculated $ADC$ of $0.897 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$ is a low value. Therefore, this magnitude is highly compatible with a malignant metastasis and not compatible with a benign hemangioma.
