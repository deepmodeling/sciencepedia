This foundational exercise challenges you to do just that for biliary colic, a condition whose name is often a misnomer. By applying first principles—including the Law of Laplace and the physiology of visceral nociception—you will deconstruct the classic temporal pattern of biliary pain, building a mental model that connects gallbladder mechanics directly to the patient's experience [@problem_id:4608093].", "problem": "A $35$-year-old patient presents with postprandial right upper quadrant pain radiating to the back, accompanied by nausea and diaphoresis. Ultrasound demonstrates a $2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ gallstone impacted at the cystic duct with a distended gallbladder but no wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or sonographic Murphy sign. Laboratory values, including leukocyte count and liver enzymes, are within normal limits. Over the ensuing hours, the patient’s pain and associated symptoms spontaneously resolve by hour $4$, and repeat imaging confirms that the stone has migrated back into the gallbladder lumen. There is no clinical or sonographic evidence of inflammation.\n\nFrom first principles, consider the following well-established bases:\n- Visceral mechanonociception arises when hollow-organ wall tension increases; the thin-wall approximation of the Law of Laplace relates wall tension to intraluminal pressure and radius by $$T \\propto P \\times r,$$ assuming wall thickness is relatively constant over short intervals, where $T$ denotes wall tension, $P$ intraluminal pressure, and $r$ gallbladder radius.\n- Cholecystokinin-induced gallbladder smooth muscle contraction after a fatty meal increases intraluminal pressure when outflow is obstructed, producing a progressive increase in wall tension and thus visceral pain.\n- Autonomic symptoms (for example, tachycardia, diaphoresis, pallor) and nausea scale with visceral afferent discharge carried by thoracic splanchnic pathways to spinal segments and via vagal pathways to brainstem centers; as afferent discharge declines, these symptoms abate.\n- In the absence of mucosal ischemia and inflammatory mediators, pain from mechanosensory stretch is expected to be self-limited and to resolve once pressure normalizes; episodes of biliary colic typically last less than $6$ hours, whereas persistent pain beyond $6$ hours suggests acute cholecystitis.\n\nGiven a $2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ stone briefly obstructing the cystic duct that resolves within $4$ hours without inflammation, which option best describes the expected temporal pattern of pain, nausea, and autonomic symptoms over the episode?\n\nA. Pain shows a crescendo over $30$–$60$ minutes as gallbladder pressure rises, then plateaus for $1$–$3$ hours, followed by a decrescendo with complete resolution by hour $4$; nausea and autonomic symptoms track pain intensity and fade within $15$–$30$ minutes of pain relief, with no fever or leukocytosis.\n\nB. Pain presents as seconds-long stabbing episodes separated by complete relief, recurring intermittently for $12$ hours; nausea is absent; diaphoresis persists for $24$ hours after pain resolution due to sustained sympathetic activation.\n\nC. Pain progressively worsens beyond $6$ hours despite stone disimpaction, with onset of fever and leukocytosis; nausea persists for $24$ hours because bile salts irritate the gastric mucosa even after gallbladder decompression.\n\nD.

Pain oscillates in $5$-minute cycles with complete relief between cycles for the entire $4$ hours; autonomic symptoms do not correlate with pain and remain constant throughout the episode.", "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must first be established through a systematic analysis of its components.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   **Patient Profile:** A $35$-year-old patient.\n*   **Clinical Presentation:** Postprandial right upper quadrant pain radiating to the back, nausea, and diaphoresis.\n*   **Initial Ultrasound Findings:** A $2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ gallstone impacted at the cystic duct; a distended gallbladder; no wall thickening; no pericholecystic fluid; no sonographic Murphy sign.\n*   **Laboratory Findings:** Leukocyte count and liver enzymes are within normal limits.\n*   **Clinical Course:** The patient's pain and associated symptoms spontaneously resolve by hour $4$.\n*   **Follow-up Imaging:** Repeat imaging confirms the stone has migrated back into the gallbladder lumen.\n*   **Final Clinical Status:** No clinical or sonographic evidence of inflammation.\n\nThe problem also establishes a set of first principles for analysis:\n*   **Law of Laplace (Thin-Wall Approximation):** Wall tension ($T$) is proportional to the product of intraluminal pressure ($P$) and radius ($r$), expressed as $T \\propto P \\times r$.\n*   **Pathophysiology of Pain:** Cholecystokinin (CCK) induces gallbladder contraction. If outflow is obstructed, intraluminal pressure ($P$) increases, leading to increased wall tension ($T$) and resultant visceral pain via mechanonociception.\n*   **Pathophysiology of Associated Symptoms:** Autonomic symptoms (e.g., diaphoresis) and nausea scale with the intensity of visceral afferent discharge. They resolve as this discharge diminishes.\n*   **Temporal Distinction:** Biliary colic episodes typically last less than $6$ hours. Pain persisting beyond $6$ hours suggests a transition to acute cholecystitis. In the absence of inflammation, pain is self-limited and resolves upon pressure normalization.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against standard criteria for validity.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic clinical scenario of biliary colic. The underlying principles—the role of CCK, the mechanics of hollow organ distension as described by the Law of Laplace, the neurophysiology of visceral pain and autonomic reflexes, and the clinical distinction between biliary colic and acute cholecystitis—are all fundamental and well-established concepts in physiology and surgery. The clinical details are entirely plausible.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated. It provides a specific set of initial conditions, a defined pathophysiological framework, and asks for a logical deduction about the temporal evolution of symptoms. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be derived from the provided information.\n*   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology. All statements are factual and quantitative where appropriate.\n\nThe problem statement exhibits none of the common flaws:\n*   It does **not** violate scientific principles.\n*   It is **not** metaphorical or irrelevant to the stated topic.\n*   It is **not** incomplete or contradictory; the resolution of symptoms by hour $4$ is consistent with the stone disimpaction and the absence of inflammatory signs.\n*   It is **not** unrealistic; this is a textbook presentation.\n*   It is **not** ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution can be derived by applying the provided first principles to the clinical scenario.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\n1.  **Initiation and Progression:** A meal stimulates CCK secretion, causing the gallbladder to contract. With the cystic duct obstructed by the $2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ stone, bile cannot be ejected. This leads to a progressive increase in intraluminal pressure ($P$). According to the Law of Laplace, $T \\propto P \\times r$, the rising pressure and associated gallbladder distension (increase in $r$) cause a rapid increase in wall tension ($T$). This escalating tension stimulates mechanonociceptors in the gallbladder wall, producing a **crescendo** pattern of visceral pain.\n\n2.  **Sustained Phase:** As long as the gallbladder continues its tonic contraction against the fixed obstruction, the intraluminal pressure and wall tension will remain elevated, resulting in a period of sustained, severe, and constant pain. This constitutes a **plateau** phase. The term \"colic\" is a historical misnomer, as the pain is typically unremitting rather than spasmodic.\n\n3.  **Resolution:** The problem states that by hour $4$, the stone disimpacts and returns to the gallbladder lumen. This event re-establishes patency of the cystic duct. The trapped, pressurized bile is released, causing a rapid fall in intraluminal pressure ($P$). Consequently, wall tension ($T$) decreases, the stimulation of mechanonociceptors ceases, and the pain resolves in a **decrescendo** pattern.\n\n4.  **Associated Symptoms:** The principle states that nausea and autonomic symptoms (diaphoresis) scale with visceral afferent discharge. Therefore, their intensity should mirror the temporal pattern of the pain: they will increase during the crescendo, persist during the plateau, and fade as the pain resolves during the decrescendo. A brief physiological lag between the cessation of the pain stimulus and the complete normalization of autonomic function is expected.\n\n5.  **Inflammatory Sequelae:** The problem explicitly rules out inflammation. Lab values are normal, and there are no signs of inflammation on ultrasound. The pain duration of less than $6$ hours further supports the diagnosis of uncomplicated biliary colic, not acute cholecystitis. Therefore, no fever or leukocytosis should develop.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Pain shows a crescendo over $30$–$60$ minutes as gallbladder pressure rises, then plateaus for $1$–$3$ hours, followed by a decrescendo with complete resolution by hour $4$; nausea and autonomic symptoms track pain intensity and fade within $15$–$30$ minutes of pain relief, with no fever or leukocytosis.**\n    This option precisely matches the derived pathophysiological sequence. The crescendo-plateau-decrescendo pain pattern is characteristic of biliary colic. The total duration fits the given $4$-hour window. The coupling of nausea and autonomic symptoms to pain intensity, followed by their resolution, is correct. The absence of fever and leukocytosis is consistent with the diagnosis of uncomplicated colic.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Pain presents as seconds-long stabbing episodes separated by complete relief, recurring intermittently for $12$ hours; nausea is absent; diaphoresis persists for $24$ hours after pain resolution due to sustained sympathetic activation.**\n    This is incorrect. The pain of biliary colic is typically constant and severe, not brief and stabbing. The duration of $12$ hours contradicts the given resolution by hour $4$ and the typical course of colic. Nausea is stated as a presenting symptom. Protracted diaphoresis for $24$ hours after pain relief is physiologically implausible and violates the principle that autonomic symptoms abate as the stimulus declines.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Pain progressively worsens beyond $6$ hours despite stone disimpaction, with onset of fever and leukocytosis; nausea persists for $24$ hours because bile salts irritate the gastric mucosa even after gallbladder decompression.**\n    This describes the progression to acute cholecystitis, a condition explicitly ruled out by the problem's givens (resolution by hour $4$, no signs of inflammation, normal labs). Pain worsening \"despite stone disimpaction\" is a direct contradiction of the established mechanical basis for the pain.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Pain stops immediately at disimpaction, but nausea and diaphoresis persist for $48$ hours due to delayed biliary clearance; low-grade fever is common despite the absence of inflammation.**\n    This is incorrect. The persistence of nausea and diaphoresis for $48$ hours strongly contradicts the principle that they scale with the pain stimulus and resolve with it. Furthermore, the statement \"low-grade fever is common despite the absence of inflammation\" is a logical and medical contradiction, as fever is an integral component of the inflammatory response.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Pain oscillates in $5$-minute cycles with complete relief between cycles for the entire $4$ hours; autonomic symptoms do not correlate with pain and remain constant throughout the episode.**\n    This is incorrect. The pain pattern described is more typical of peristaltic colic (e.g., ureteric or intestinal) rather than the tonic, sustained pain of biliary obstruction. The statement that autonomic symptoms \"do not correlate with pain\" is a direct violation of a given first principle.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4608093"}, {"introduction": "Clinical decision-making frequently involves navigating incomplete or conflicting data.

The patient presentation is a classic scenario for biliary disease. The definitions and test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) for Murphy's sign, ultrasound, and HIDA scan are consistent with values reported in medical literature. The diagnostic reasoning process described is standard clinical practice. The problem is free of pseudoscience.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific clinical scenario, relevant test characteristics, and a pretest probability. The task is to calculate a post-test probability and use it to select the most logical next step from a set of options. This structure allows for a unique, meaningful solution based on quantitative reasoning and established clinical guidelines.\n- **Objective:** The language is clear, precise, and unbiased. It presents clinical data and established facts without subjective framing.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem in clinical reasoning and applied probability. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe central task is to update the probability of acute cholecystitis (AC) given the new information: a negative clinical Murphy’s sign. This requires a Bayesian analysis.\n\nLet AC+ be the event that the patient has acute cholecystitis, and AC- be the event that she does not.\nLet M- be the event of a negative Murphy's sign.\n\nThe pretest probability is given as $P(\\text{AC+}) = p_0 = 0.55$.\nThe probability of not having AC is $P(\\text{AC-}) = 1 - p_0 = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45$.\n\nThe test characteristics for Murphy's sign (M) are:\n- Sensitivity: $Se_M = P(\\text{M+}|\\text{AC+}) = 0.65$\n- Specificity: $Sp_M = P(\\text{M-}|\\text{AC-}) = 0.87$\n\nFrom sensitivity, we can find the probability of a negative test in a patient with the disease:\n$P(\\text{M-}|\\text{AC+}) = 1 - Se_M = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35$. This is the false negative rate.\n\nWe need to calculate the post-test probability, $P(\\text{AC+}|\\text{M-})$, using Bayes' theorem. A convenient way is to use likelihood ratios and odds. The likelihood ratio for a negative test result (LR-) is the ratio of the probability of a negative test in those with the disease to the probability of a negative test in those without the disease.\n\n$$ \\text{LR}- = \\frac{P(\\text{M-}|\\text{AC+})}{P(\\text{M-}|\\text{AC-})} = \\frac{1 - Se_M}{Sp_M} $$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$ \\text{LR}- = \\frac{1 - 0.65}{0.87} = \\frac{0.35}{0.87} \\approx 0.4023 $$\n\nNext, we convert the pretest probability into pretest odds:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(\\text{AC+})}{P(\\text{AC-})} = \\frac{0.55}{0.45} \\approx 1.2222 $$\n\nThe post-test odds are the product of the pretest odds and the likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times \\text{LR}- \\approx 1.2222 \\times 0.4023 \\approx 0.4915 $$\n\nFinally, we convert the post-test odds back to a probability:\n$$ P(\\text{AC+}|\\text{M-}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}} \\approx \\frac{0.4915}{1 + 0.4915} = \\frac{0.4915}{1.4915} \\approx 0.3295 $$\n\nSo, after observing a negative Murphy's sign, the probability of acute cholecystitis has decreased from $55\\%$ to approximately $33\\%$.\n\n**Clinical Interpretation:**\nA post-test probability of $33\\%$ is neither low enough to confidently rule out acute cholecystitis nor high enough to justify immediate invasive treatment like surgery. The patient still has a $1$ in $3$ chance of having the disease, and her clinical presentation (prolonged pain, fever, leukocytosis, elevated CRP) remains highly concerning. Therefore, further diagnostic workup is mandatory. The appropriate strategy is to follow the standard diagnostic algorithm for suspected cholecystitis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Obtain RUQ Ultrasound now to evaluate for gallstones and secondary signs; if RUQ US is negative or equivocal but clinical suspicion remains moderate, proceed to HIDA scintigraphy; initiate empiric antibiotics and early surgical consultation if systemic inflammation persists or imaging supports acute cholecystitis.**\n- This option proposes using RUQ ultrasound as the next step. The problem statement identifies this as the \"first-line imaging\" test. This is appropriate.\n- It correctly identifies the remaining clinical suspicion as \"moderate\" ($33\\%$ probability with concerning systemic signs).\n- It provides a logical contingency plan: if the ultrasound is inconclusive, proceed to the more sensitive and specific HIDA scan. This is standard practice.\n- The management plan (antibiotics for suspected infection and inflammation, surgical consultation for definitive treatment) is entirely appropriate for a patient with persistent signs of inflammation who is being worked up for acute cholecystitis.\n- This option represents a safe, logical, and evidence-based approach that aligns perfectly with the quantitative analysis and clinical context.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Proceed directly to contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis as the first-line test for acute cholecystitis because Murphy’s sign is negative.**\n- The problem explicitly states that RUQ ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality. CT is generally considered second-line, useful for evaluating complications (e.g., gangrene, perforation) or alternative diagnoses. It is less sensitive than ultrasound for detecting gallstones and involves ionizing radiation and contrast risks. A negative Murphy's sign reduces but does not eliminate the suspicion of cholecystitis, and it does not justify deviating from the standard first-line test.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Discharge the patient with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without imaging because a negative Murphy’s sign effectively excludes acute cholecystitis.**\n- This claim is demonstrably false. Our calculation shows the post-test probability is approximately $33\\%$. A $1$ in $3$ risk is not an \"exclusion\". Moreover, the sensitivity of Murphy's sign is only $0.65$, making it a poor tool for ruling out disease (a good rule-out test requires very high sensitivity). Discharging a patient with fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and an elevated CRP would be clinically negligent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Perform emergent ERCP to decompress the Common Bile Duct because leukocytosis and right upper quadrant pain imply high risk of choledocholithiasis.**\n- ERCP is an invasive procedure indicated for obstruction of the *common bile duct* (choledocholithiasis), often leading to cholangitis. This patient's laboratory values (normal total bilirubin, normal AST/ALT) provide strong evidence against a common bile duct obstruction. The primary suspicion is for *cystic duct* obstruction (cholecystitis). Performing an unnecessary ERCP would expose the patient to significant risks (e.g., pancreatitis, perforation) without diagnostic or therapeutic benefit for the suspected condition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Order Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) as the first-line test to diagnose cystic duct obstruction in suspected acute cholecystitis.**\n- MRCP is an excellent non-invasive test for visualizing the biliary tree and is primarily used to diagnose or rule out common bile duct stones. It is not the first-line investigation for acute cholecystitis. RUQ ultrasound is faster, cheaper, more widely available, and is the established first-line test. While MRCP can show signs of cholecystitis, it is not the initial test of choice in this clinical algorithm.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4608052"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is established, the critical next step is to accurately assess the severity of the illness, as this dictates the entire management strategy—from the level of care to the timing and type of intervention.

Although it has risen from a baseline of $1.0\\,\\text{mg/dL}$ and is associated with oliguria ($0.4\\,\\text{mL/kg/h}$), it does not meet the strict creatinine threshold of $ 2.0\\,\\text{mg/dL}$ for Grade $\\text{III}$.\n    *   Hepatic dysfunction: International Normalized Ratio (INR) $ 1.5$. This patient's INR is $1.1$, so this is not met.\n    *   Hematologic dysfunction: Platelet count  $100,000/\\mu\\text{L}$. This patient's platelet count is $210,000/\\mu\\text{L}$, so this is not met.\n    Conclusion: The patient does not meet the criteria for Grade $\\text{III}$ cholecystitis.\n\n*   **Grade $\\text{II}$ (Moderate) Cholecystitis** is diagnosed in the absence of Grade $\\text{III}$ criteria but with the presence of any of the following:\n    *   Elevated WBC count > $18,000/\\mu\\text{L}$. This patient's WBC is $18,000/\\mu\\text{L}$. Therefore, this specific criterion is not strictly met.\n    *   Palpable tender mass in the RUQ. This is present.\n    *   Duration of symptoms $ 72$ hours. Not present; duration is $36$ hours.\n    *   Marked local inflammation (e.g., gangrenous cholecystitis, pericholecystic abscess). The presence of a palpable mass and pericholecystic fluid are highly suggestive of marked local inflammation.\n    Conclusion: The patient clearly meets the criterion of a \"palpable tender mass in the RUQ\". The presence of this sign alone is sufficient to classify the disease as Grade $\\text{II}$.\n\n*   **Grade $\\text{I}$ (Mild) Cholecystitis** is diagnosed when a patient with acute cholecystitis does not meet any criteria for Grade $\\text{II}$ or Grade $\\text{III}$. This is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is **Moderate (Grade $\\text{II}$) Acute Cholecystitis**.\n\n**Management Plan for Grade $\\text{II}$ Acute Cholecystitis**\nThe management is guided by principles of sepsis resuscitation and definitive source control.\n1.  **Resuscitation:** The patient exhibits signs of sepsis with hypoperfusion (tachycardia $112\\,\\text{beats/min}$, elevated lactate $2.1\\,\\text{mmol/L}$, and oliguria $0.4\\,\\text{mL/kg/h}$). The acute kidney injury (creatinine rise from $1.0$ to $1.8\\,\\text{mg/dL}$) is most likely pre-renal due to this hypoperfusion. The initial step is aggressive fluid resuscitation with an isotonic balanced crystalloid solution (e.g., Lactated Ringer's) to restore intravascular volume and organ perfusion. A standard resuscitation target is a urine output of $\\ge 0.5\\,\\text{mL/kg/h}$.\n2.  **Antimicrobials:** Prompt administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is critical. The regimen must cover common biliary pathogens, which are typically enteric Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes.\n3.  **Source Control:** Definitive source control is achieved by cholecystectomy. For Grade $\\text{II}$ cholecystitis, the standard of care is **early laparoscopic cholecystectomy**, performed within $24$–$72$ hours after the patient is stabilized with initial medical management. An alternative, percutaneous cholecystostomy (PT-GBD), is reserved for patients who are at prohibitive risk for surgery or who fail to improve or deteriorate despite appropriate medical therapy.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Classify as severe (Grade III) acute cholecystitis and initiate intensive care unit management with immediate vasopressors, broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and percutaneous cholecystostomy as definitive source control; defer cholecystectomy indefinitely.**\n    This option is incorrect. The classification is Grade $\\text{II}$, not Grade $\\text{III}$. Vasopressors are not indicated as the patient is not hypotensive. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is not the definitive source control for a surgically fit patient, and deferring cholecystectomy indefinitely is inappropriate. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. Classify as moderate (Grade II) acute cholecystitis and initiate isotonic balanced crystalloid to restore perfusion with urine output target $\\ge 0.5\\,\\text{mL/kg/h}$, start broad-spectrum antimicrobials covering enteric Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes promptly, and proceed to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within $24$–$72\\,\\text{h}$ after stabilization; reserve percutaneous cholecystostomy for clinical deterioration or prohibitive operative risk.**\n    This option is correct. It correctly classifies the disease as Moderate (Grade $\\text{II}$). The proposed management plan accurately reflects the standard of care: appropriate fluid resuscitation with a clear physiological target, prompt and appropriate antibiotic coverage, and the correct timing and modality for source control (early laparoscopic cholecystectomy) with the proper role defined for percutaneous drainage. **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. Classify as mild (Grade I) acute cholecystitis and manage as outpatient with oral analgesics, no antibiotics, and schedule elective cholecystectomy in $4$–$6$ weeks.**\n    This option is incorrect. The classification is wrong; the patient is far too ill to have Grade $\\text{I}$ disease. The management plan is dangerously inadequate and would lead to clinical deterioration from untreated sepsis. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Classify as moderate (Grade II) acute cholecystitis but restrict fluids due to renal dysfunction, delay antimicrobials until cultures return, perform emergent Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for presumed common bile duct stone, and postpone cholecystectomy until after biliary drainage.**\n    This option is incorrect. While the classification is correct, the management plan is flawed and dangerous. Fluid restriction would worsen the pre-renal acute kidney injury. Delaying antibiotics in a septic patient is a critical error. There is no evidence of a common bile duct stone (normal bilirubin, normal CBD diameter), so an emergent ERCP is not indicated and carries unnecessary risk. The entire management strategy is contrary to established principles. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4608084"}]}
