He presents $6$ hours after the onset of rigors, vomiting, and confusion. On arrival, his vital signs are: respiratory rate $30$ breaths per minute, heart rate $128$ beats per minute, systolic blood pressure $88 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, temperature $39.6^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, oxygen saturation $88$ on room air, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score $13$ with new confusion.

For the purpose of a single numeric output, the institution uses a composite splenic sepsis escalation index defined by $I = \\mathrm{qSOFA} + \\mathrm{NEWS}2$. Compute $I$. Express the final value of $I$ as an exact integer with no rounding. No units are required for $I$.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary clinical data to compute the requested scores based on standard, universally accepted medical definitions (qSOFA and NEWS2). The premises are clinically realistic, describing a classic presentation of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). The composite index $I$ is explicitly defined, ensuring a unique solution can be derived from the provided data.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, then the National Early Warning Score version 2 (NEWS2), and finally combining them to find the composite index $I$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the qSOFA Score**\n\nThe qSOFA score is a bedside prompt to identify patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk for a poor outcome. It consists of three criteria, with one point awarded for each criterion that is met. A score of $2$ or more suggests a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.\n\nThe three criteria are:\n- Respiratory rate (RR) $\\ge 22$ breaths per minute.\n- Altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale score $< 15$).\n- Systolic blood pressure (SBP) $\\le 100 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nApplying the patient's data:\n- The patient's respiratory rate is $30$ breaths per minute. Since $30 \\ge 22$, this criterion is met. (Score = $+1$)\n- The patient has new confusion and a GCS score of $13$. Since $13 < 15$, this criterion is met. (Score = $+1$)\n- The patient's systolic blood pressure is $88 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. Since $88 \\le 100$, this criterion is met. (Score = $+1$)\n\nThe total qSOFA score is the sum of the points for each criterion:\n$$ \\mathrm{qSOFA}_{\\text{score}} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the NEWS2 Score**\n\nThe NEWS2 score is a standardized system for assessing the severity of a patient's illness. It is based on six physiological parameters plus a seventh for supplemental oxygen use.\n\nThe patient's parameters are scored as follows:\n- **Respiratory Rate (RR):** The patient's RR is $30$ breaths/min. In the NEWS2 scoring system, an RR $\\ge 25$ scores $3$ points.\n- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2):** The patient's SpO2 is $88\\%$ on room air. The problem states no history of chronic lung disease, so Scale $1$ is used. An SpO2 $\\le 91\\%$ on Scale $1$ scores $3$ points.\n- **Supplemental Oxygen:** The patient is on room air. This scores $0$ points.\n- **Temperature:** The patient's temperature is $39.6^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. A temperature $\\ge 39.1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ scores $2$ points.\n- **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP):** The patient's SBP is $88 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. An SBP $\\le 90 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ scores $3$ points.\n- **Heart Rate (HR):** The patient's HR is $128$ beats/min. A heart rate between $111$ and $130$ beats/min scores $2$ points.\n- **Level of Consciousness:** The patient is described as having \"new confusion.\" Any new confusion (or a score of V, P, or U on the AVPU scale) scores $3$ points.\n\nThe total NEWS2 score is the sum of the individual parameter scores:\n$$ \\mathrm{NEWS}2_{\\text{score}} = \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{RR}} + \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{SpO2}} + \\underbrace{0}_{\\text{O2}} + \\underbrace{2}_{\\text{Temp}} + \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{SBP}} + \\underbrace{2}_{\\text{HR}} + \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{Consciousness}} = 16 $$\n\nA NEWS2 score of $7$ or more is a high-risk score, indicating a high likelihood of clinical deterioration and mandating an urgent response by a critical care team. This patient's score of $16$ signifies an extremely critical condition.\n\n**3. Proposed Escalation Plan (Qualitative Discussion)**\n\nThe patient presents with septic shock (hypotension, confusion, and hyperlactatemia) secondary to suspected OPSI, a life-threatening emergency. The management plan must be immediate and aggressive.\n- **Fluid Resuscitation:** The patient is hypotensive (SBP $88 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) with a lactate of $5.8 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, indicating severe tissue hypoperfusion. Immediate, aggressive fluid resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid solution at $30 \\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$ is indicated. For a $70 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ patient, this amounts to $2100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$, administered rapidly. If hypotension persists, vasopressor therapy (e.g., norepinephrine) should be initiated to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least $65 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- **Antimicrobial Therapy:** Given the high mortality of OPSI, empiric broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics must be administered within one hour of recognition, after blood cultures are drawn. The regimen must cover encapsulated organisms, the most common pathogens in OPSI ($Streptococcus$ $pneumoniae$, $Haemophilus$ $influenzae$ type b, and $Neisseria$ $meningitidis$). A standard high-potency regimen includes a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone $2 \\ \\mathrm{g}$) plus vancomycin (to cover for resistant pneumococci and staphylococci).\n- **Supportive Care:** The patient's hypoxia (SpO2 $88\\%$) and tachypnea (RR $30$) require immediate supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation $> 94\\%$. Given the altered mental status and high work of breathing, immediate admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is mandatory for continuous monitoring, with a low threshold for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Composite Splenic Sepsis Escalation Index ($I$)**\n\nThe problem defines the composite index $I$ as the sum of the qSOFA and NEWS2 scores.\n$$ I = \\mathrm{qSOFA} + \\mathrm{NEWS}2 $$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$ I = 3 + 16 = 19 $$\n\nThe value of the composite index $I$ is $19$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{19}$$", "id": "4651902"}, {"introduction": "Before a patient can be managed for OPSI risk, they must first be identified as having anatomical or functional asplenia.

The problem statement is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics, provides a complete and consistent set of data, and is well-posed, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the framework for analyzing the diagnostic test data.

The spleen’s role in immune defense includes facilitating opsonization, production of immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory responses, and macrophage-mediated clearance of encapsulated bacteria; its loss increases susceptibility to rapidly progressive bacteremia. Functional antibody activity against pneumococcal serotypes is assessed using the Opsonophagocytic Assay (OPA), which reports an opsonization index as the reciprocal dilution of serum that achieves a defined target of bacterial killing. For a given serotype $s$, define the fold rise $F_{s}$ as the ratio of the post-vaccination opsonization index to the pre-vaccination opsonization index.
