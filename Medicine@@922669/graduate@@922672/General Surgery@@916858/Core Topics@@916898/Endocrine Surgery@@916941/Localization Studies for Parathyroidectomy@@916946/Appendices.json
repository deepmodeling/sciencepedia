The concepts of prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV are cornerstones of evidence-based medicine.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity) to uniquely determine the PPV and NPV. The request to derive the formulas from first principles is a clear directive.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. The data are provided as objective figures, and the tasks are purely mathematical and logical.\n- The problem is free of any scientific or factual unsoundness, is completely formalizable, is self-contained, and is well-structured. The provided numerical values are plausible within the specified clinical context.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that a patient has a single-gland adenoma, and let $D^c$ denote the complementary event that the patient does not have a single-gland adenoma (i.e., they have multi-gland disease or no adenoma). Let $T$ represent the event that the 4D-CT test is positive (correctly localizes a single adenoma), and let $T^c$ represent the event that the test is negative.\n\nThe information provided in the problem can be expressed in terms of probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of single-gland disease is $P(D) = 0.8$.\n    Consequently, the probability of not having single-gland disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. This is the conditional probability $P(T | D) = 0.85$.\n3.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. This is the conditional probability $P(T^c | D^c) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also derive the probabilities of incorrect test results:\n-   The false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is present: $P(T^c | D) = 1 - P(T | D) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n-   The false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent: $P(T | D^c) = 1 - P(T^c | D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient truly has the disease given that the test result is positive. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(D | T)$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, which forms the basis of Bayes' theorem:\n$$ PPV = P(D | T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive (a true positive). It can be found using the definition of conditional probability: $P(D \\cap T) = P(T | D) P(D)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. By the law of total probability, this is the sum of the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive:\n$$ P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c) $$\n$$ P(T) = P(T | D) P(D) + P(T | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting these expressions for the numerator and denominator yields the formula for PPV derived from first principles:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{P(T | D) P(D)}{P(T | D) P(D) + P(T | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.8)}{(0.85)(0.8) + (0.10)(0.2)} = \\frac{0.68}{0.68 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.68}{0.70} = \\frac{34}{35} $$\nThe numerical value is $PPV \\approx 0.97142857...$. Rounded to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.9714$.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient truly does not have the disease given that the test result is negative. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(D^c | T^c)$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ NPV = P(D^c | T^c) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^c)}{P(T^c)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(D^c \\cap T^c)$, is the joint probability of not having the disease and testing negative (a true negative). It can be found as $P(D^c \\cap T^c) = P(T^c | D^c) P(D^c)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^c)$, is the total probability of obtaining a negative test result. By the law of total probability, this is the sum of the probabilities of a true negative and a false negative:\n$$ P(T^c) = P(T^c \\cap D^c) + P(T^c \\cap D) $$\n$$ P(T^c) = P(T^c | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^c | D) P(D) $$\nSubstituting these expressions for the numerator and denominator yields the formula for NPV derived from first principles:\n$$ NPV = \\frac{P(T^c | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^c | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^c | D) P(D)} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$ NPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.2)}{(0.90)(0.2) + (0.15)(0.8)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.12} = \\frac{0.18}{0.30} = \\frac{3}{5} $$\nThe numerical value is $NPV = 0.6$.

The problem states that under $\\mathrm{MGD}$, each test independently lateralizes to the left or right with a probability of $0.5$ for each side.\n$$P(E \\mid \\mathrm{MGD}) = P(U_R \\cap M_L \\mid \\mathrm{MGD})$$\nDue to the conditional independence of the tests given the disease state:\n$$P(E \\mid \\mathrm{MGD}) = P(U_R \\mid \\mathrm{MGD}) \\times P(M_L \\mid \\mathrm{MGD}) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$$\n\nNext, consider the case of single-gland disease ($\\mathrm{SGD}$). The location of the single adenoma can be on the right (let's denote this event $R_T$) or on the left ($L_T$). The problem states these are equally likely, so $P(R_T \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}) = 0.5$ and $P(L_T \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}) = 0.5$. We can find $P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD})$ by conditioning on the true location of the adenoma:\n$$P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}) = P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD} \\cap R_T) P(R_T \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}) + P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD} \\cap L_T) P(L_T \\mid \\mathrm{SGD})$$\nThe tests are conditionally independent.\nIf the true adenoma is on the right ($R_T$), then:\n- Ultrasound reporting right ($U_R$) is a correct localization, with probability $1-\\alpha$.\n- MIBI reporting left ($M_L$) is an incorrect localization, with probability $\\alpha$.\nSo, $P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}, R_T) = P(U_R \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}, R_T) \\times P(M_L \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}, R_T) = (1-\\alpha)\\alpha$.\n\nIf the true adenoma is on the left ($L_T$), then:\n- Ultrasound reporting right ($U_R$) is an incorrect localization, with probability $\\alpha$.\n- MIBI reporting left ($M_L$) is a correct localization, with probability $1-\\alpha$.\nSo, $P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}, L_T) = P(U_R \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}, L_T) \\times P(M_L \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}, L_T) = \\alpha(1-\\alpha)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD})$:\n$$P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}) = ((1-\\alpha)\\alpha) \\times (0.5) + (\\alpha(1-\\alpha)) \\times (0.5)$$\n$$P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}) = \\alpha(1-\\alpha)$$\nUsing the given value $\\alpha = 0.10$:\n$$P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD}) = 0.10 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 0.10 \\times 0.90 = 0.09$$\n\nNow we can calculate the total probability of the evidence, $P(E)$:\n$$P(E) = P(E \\mid \\mathrm{MGD})P(\\mathrm{MGD}) + P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SGD})P(\\mathrm{SGD})$$\n$$P(E) = (0.25 \\times 0.15) + (0.09 \\times 0.85) = 0.0375 + 0.0765 = 0.114$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the posterior probability $P(\\mathrm{MGD} \\mid E)$:\n$$P(\\mathrm{MGD} \\mid E) = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\mathrm{MGD}) P(\\mathrm{MGD})}{P(E)} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 0.15}{0.114} = \\frac{0.0375}{0.114}$$\n$$P(\\mathrm{MGD} \\mid E) \\approx 0.32894736...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.3289$.\n\nThe derived expression for the posterior probability is:\n$$P(\\mathrm{MGD} \\mid E) = \\frac{(0.5)^2 p_0}{(0.5)^2 p_0 + \\alpha(1-\\alpha)(1-p_0)}$$\n\nThe second part of the question asks for an evidence-based strategy. The calculated posterior probability of multigland disease, $P(\\mathrm{MGD} \\mid E) \\approx 0.33$, is substantially higher than the prior probability of $0.15$. This increase is a direct result of the discordant imaging findings, which are more probable under an assumption of $\\mathrm{MGD}$ (probability $0.25$) than under $\\mathrm{SGD}$ (probability $0.09$). A probability of $\\mathrm{MGD}$ of approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ is too high to justify a focused, unilateral parathyroidectomy, an approach that relies on high preoperative confidence in the location of a single adenoma. The risk of surgical failure (persistent hyperparathyroidism) with a focused approach is unacceptably high.\n\nTherefore, the evidence-based strategy should be as follows:\n1.  **Re-evaluate Operative Plan**: The default plan should shift from a focused unilateral approach to a bilateral neck exploration (BNE). BNE is the historical gold standard and remains the procedure of choice for known or suspected multiglandular disease and in cases of non-localizing or discordant preoperative imaging. It allows for the identification of all four parathyroid glands and definitive treatment.\n2.  **Consider Additional Localization**: Before proceeding to surgery, obtaining a third, high-fidelity imaging study is a prudent step. A Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography (4D-CT) scan is often used in this scenario. If 4D-CT can convincingly localize a single gland (ideally correlating with either the ultrasound or MIBI finding), it may restore sufficient confidence to attempt a focused approach. If the 4D-CT is also non-localizing or discordant, it further strengthens the indication for BNE.\n3.  **Mandatory Intraoperative PTH (ioPTH) Monitoring**: Regardless of the planned approach, intraoperative PTH monitoring is essential. If a focused exploration were attempted against the odds, a failure of the PTH level to drop by more than $50\\%$ from baseline after gland excision would be an absolute indication to convert to a full bilateral exploration. Even with an adequate drop, the high posterior probability of $\\mathrm{MGD}$ warrants caution, as a second, smaller adenoma might not be detected by the PTH dynamics in all cases.\n\nIn summary, the discordant imaging significantly increases the suspicion of multigland disease, mandating a shift in strategy towards bilateral neck exploration, potentially preceded by an attempt to resolve the discordance with a 4D-CT scan.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3289}$$", "id": "4638727"}]}
