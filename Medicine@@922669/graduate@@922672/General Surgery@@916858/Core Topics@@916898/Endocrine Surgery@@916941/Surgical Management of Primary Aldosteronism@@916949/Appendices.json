The cornerstone of this screening is the aldosterone-renin ratio ($ARR$), which leverages the core pathophysiology of the disease: autonomous aldosterone secretion leading to suppression of plasma renin activity. This exercise provides practice in calculating the $ARR$ from standard laboratory values, a fundamental skill for identifying patients who warrant further investigation [@problem_id:4675293].", "problem": "A patient is being screened for Primary Aldosteronism (PA) in the context of surgical candidacy assessment. The Aldosterone-Renin Ratio (ARR) is defined as the ratio of serum aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity and is used as an initial screening test. Under standardized sampling conditions appropriate for renin-angiotensin physiology assessment (morning collection, ambulatory posture after stabilization, and withdrawal of interfering antihypertensives with appropriate substitution), the measured serum aldosterone concentration is $18$ ng/dL and the plasma renin activity (PRA) is $0.2$ ng/mL/hr. A screening threshold of $20$ is used for ARR positivity under these units. Starting from the definition of a ratio as the quotient of two measured quantities, compute the numeric value of $ARR$ as a unitless ratio using the provided measurements and determine if it meets or exceeds the screening threshold of $20$ under the specified measurement conditions.

The computed $ARR$ is to be a unitless number.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to validation against the established criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established principles of endocrinology and clinical chemistry. The use of the Aldosterone-Renin Ratio ($ARR$) is a standard, first-line screening test for Primary Aldosteronism (PA). The values for aldosterone and renin activity are within clinically plausible ranges, and the given threshold is a commonly cited value in medical literature, although specific laboratory cutoffs can vary. The problem is factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear definition to compute a single, unique numerical value. The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language, free of subjective claims or bias. It requests a specific calculation and a comparison based on given quantitative data.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial in a way that subverts its scientific context. The potential for confusion regarding the mismatch in volume units (dL vs. mL) is resolved by the problem's own directive: the threshold of $20$ is based on these specific units, and the final ratio is to be treated as a unitless number. This reflects a common clinical convention where the ratio's numerical value is used directly, with the units implicitly understood.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Aldosterone-Renin Ratio ($ARR$) is defined as the quotient of the serum aldosterone concentration, denoted by $A$, and the plasma renin activity, denoted by $R$.\n$$ARR = \\frac{A}{R}$$\nThe provided values are:\n- Serum aldosterone concentration, $A = 18 \\text{ ng/dL}$.\n- Plasma renin activity, $R = 0.2 \\text{ ng/mL/hr}$.\n\nThe problem instructs to compute the numeric value of the $ARR$ as a unitless ratio, using the provided measurements. This is a standard clinical convention where the ratio is calculated directly from the given numerical values, and the resulting number is compared against a threshold established for those specific units.\n$$ARR = \\frac{18}{0.2}$$\nTo compute this value, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $10$ to remove the decimal in the denominator.\n$$ARR = \\frac{18 \\times 10}{0.2 \\times 10} = \\frac{180}{2}$$\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$ARR = 90$$\nThe computed $ARR$ is a unitless value of $90$.\n\nThe problem requires a determination of whether this value meets or exceeds the screening threshold.\n- Computed $ARR = 90$.\n- Screening threshold = $20$.\n\nThe comparison is a simple inequality:\n$$90 > 20$$\nSince the computed $ARR$ of $90$ is greater than the screening threshold of $20$, the result is positive and meets the criterion for further diagnostic workup of Primary Aldosteronism.

A solution will be formulated based on the provided information.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe task is to compute the Lateralization Index (LI) and, based on this value, determine if the data indicate unilateral right aldosterone excess.\n\nThe Lateralization Index is defined as:\n$$ LI = \\frac{(A/C)_{\\text{dominant}}}{(A/C)_{\\text{contralateral}}} $$\nThe dominant side is the adrenal gland with the higher aldosterone-to-cortisol ratio. We are given the following values:\n$$ (A/C)_{\\text{right}} = 25 $$\n$$ (A/C)_{\\text{left}} = 5 $$\n\nTo identify the dominant side, we compare these two values:\n$$ 25 > 5 $$\nSince $(A/C)_{\\text{right}} > (A/C)_{\\text{left}}$, the right adrenal gland is the dominant side, and the left adrenal gland is the contralateral side.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$ (A/C)_{\\text{dominant}} = (A/C)_{\\text{right}} = 25 $$\n$$ (A/C)_{\\text{contralateral}} = (A/C)_{\\text{left}} = 5 $$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the Lateralization Index:\n$$ LI = \\frac{25}{5} $$\nPerforming the division yields the exact numerical value of the LI:\n$$ LI = 5 $$\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an interpretation of this result. The established threshold for diagnosing unilateral aldosterone excess under cosyntropin stimulation is given as $LI \\ge 4$. We compare our calculated LI to this threshold:\n$$ 5 \\ge 4 $$\nThis inequality is true. The calculated Lateralization Index of $5$ meets the criterion for unilateral aldosterone excess. Since the dominant side, which is the numerator in the LI calculation, was determined to be the right adrenal gland, the data specifically indicate unilateral right aldosterone excess.
