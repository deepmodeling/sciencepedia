By applying this law, you will practice how to make data-driven estimates for ward capacity, a foundational skill in strategic resource planning [@problem_id:4672054].", "problem": "A tertiary general surgery service operates a dedicated inpatient ward. Leadership needs to estimate the steady-state bed capacity required to avoid chronic over-occupancy. Assume a stable system in the sense that, over long horizons, the average admission rate equals the average discharge rate and patient inflow does not systematically exceed outflow. Let the long-run average admission rate be $\\lambda$ patients per unit time and let the Average Length of Stay (ALOS) be $W$ time units. The long-run average number of occupied beds is denoted by $L$. \n\nStarting from conservation-of-flow and time-averaging principles, derive the invariant relationship between $L$, $\\lambda$, and $W$ that holds in steady state.

Consider any horizon of length $T>0$. Let $A(T)$ be the number of admissions during $T$, let $L(t)$ denote the instantaneous number of occupied beds at time $t$, and let $D(T)$ be the total patient-time accumulated over the horizon, measured in bed-days if time is measured in days. By definition,\n$$\nD(T) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{T} L(t)\\, dt.\n$$\nDefine the long-run time-average occupancy as\n$$\n\\bar{L} \\equiv \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{D(T)}{T} = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} L(t)\\, dt,\n$$\nassuming the limit exists under the stability condition. The Average Length of Stay (ALOS) $W$ is defined as the long-run average total time spent in the system per admission. Over a long horizon, this can be expressed as\n$$\nW \\equiv \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{D(T)}{A(T)}.\n$$\nFor a stable system (long-run flow conservation), the long-run admission rate is\n$$\n\\lambda \\equiv \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{A(T)}{T}.\n$$\nCombining these definitions yields the invariant relationship between the time-average occupancy, the arrival rate, and the average length of stay:\n$$\n\\bar{L} = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{D(T)}{T} = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{A(T)}{T}\\cdot \\frac{D(T)}{A(T)} = \\lambda W.\n$$\nThis identity is the content of Little’s Law, derived from conservation-of-flow and long-run averaging.\n\nInterpreting $\\bar{L}$ as the mean bed occupancy, the steady-state capacity implied by the long-run mean is therefore $L = \\lambda W$.

Two sources of variability are relevant: interarrival variability (for example, clustering of scheduled cases or bursts of emergency admissions) and service-time variability (heterogeneous lengths of stay). In the canonical infinite-server model (many parallel beds without queueing constraints), a well-tested fact is that the steady-state occupancy distribution is Poisson with mean $\\lambda W$, implying variance equal to the mean. Under this approximation, the standard deviation of occupancy is $\\sqrt{\\lambda W}$. Thus, if the mean occupancy is $L$, typical fluctuations are of order $\\sqrt{L}$. Leadership thus recognizes that designing capacity exactly at $L$ risks frequent full occupancy events; a buffer above $L$ mitigates the probability of bed shortages. For example, using a normal approximation to the Poisson distribution, the $p$-quantile of occupancy is approximately $L + z_{p}\\sqrt{L}$, where $z_{p}$ is the standard normal quantile corresponding to probability $p$. This principled buffer accounts for variability and sets a service level target (for example, choosing $p=0.95$ to reduce the likelihood of turning away or delaying admissions). Nonetheless, the minimal steady-state requirement is anchored by $L=\\lambda W$, and the buffer is a leadership decision calibrated to risk tolerance, surge capacity plans, and patient safety considerations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{60}$$", "id": "4672054"}, {"introduction": "While ward capacity sets the overall scale, the operating room (OR) is the engine of a surgical service, and its efficiency directly drives daily productivity. This practice problem shifts focus from macro-planning to the tactical management of OR throughput.

Each surgical case has an average in-room duration of $90$ minutes from wheels-in to wheels-out, and room turnover between completed cases requires an average of $20$ minutes. The scheduled day length is $8$ hours, and the scheduler will not overbook beyond the scheduled time. Assume that the day consists of an integer number of cases, that there is no turnover after the final case, and that averages are used deterministically for planning. Using only conservation of time and additivity of durations, determine the largest integer number of cases that can be completed within the scheduled day under the baseline turnover and under a reduced turnover of $10$ minutes. Then, based on these two values, compute the increase in the expected number of completed cases per day attributable to reducing turnover from $20$ minutes to $10$ minutes.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single number equal to the additional expected number of completed cases per day when turnover is reduced to $10$ minutes. No rounding is required and no units should be included in the final answer.", "solution": "The core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of time. The total time consumed by all surgical cases and the associated turnover periods must not exceed the total scheduled time available in the Operating Room.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the provided data:\n- Let $N$ be the number of surgical cases, which must be a non-negative integer ($N \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$).\n- Let $T_{case}$ be the duration of a single surgical case, given as $T_{case} = 90$ minutes.\n- Let $T_{turnover}$ be the time required for room turnover between cases.\n- Let $T_{day}$ be the total scheduled length of the day.\n\nThe total time available in the day is given as $8$ hours. To maintain consistent units, we convert this to minutes:\n$$T_{day} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{hour}} = 480 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nThe total time required for $N$ cases, denoted $T_{total}(N)$, is the sum of the total time for the surgeries and the total time for turnovers. Since there is no turnover after the final case, there are $N-1$ turnover periods for $N$ cases (for $N \\ge 1$). The total time is therefore:\n$$T_{total}(N) = N \\cdot T_{case} + (N-1) \\cdot T_{turnover}$$\nThis formula is valid for $N \\ge 1$. If $N=0$, the time used is $0$. If $N=1$, the time is $T_{case}$, which the formula correctly gives: $1 \\cdot T_{case} + (1-1) \\cdot T_{turnover} = T_{case}$.\n\nThe constraint is that the total time used must not be greater than the available time:\n$$N \\cdot T_{case} + (N-1) \\cdot T_{turnover} \\le T_{day}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the largest integer $N$ that satisfies this inequality for two different turnover times.\n\n**Scenario 1: Baseline Turnover**\n\nIn this scenario, the turnover time is $T_{turnover, 1} = 20$ minutes.

Let $N_2$ be the maximum number of cases that can be completed. The governing inequality is:\n$$N_2 \\cdot 90 + (N_2 - 1) \\cdot 10 \\le 480$$\nWe solve for $N_2$:\n$$90N_2 + 10N_2 - 10 \\le 480$$\n$$100N_2 \\le 480 + 10$$\n$$100N_2 \\le 490$$\n$$N_2 \\le \\frac{490}{100} = 4.9$$\nSince $N_2$ must be an integer, the largest integer value satisfying this condition is:\n$$N_2 = \\lfloor 4.9 \\rfloor = 4$$\nThus, a maximum of $4$ cases can be completed even with the reduced turnover time.\n\n**Calculating the Increase in Cases**\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in the expected number of completed cases per day attributable to the reduction in turnover time. This is the difference between $N_2$ and $N_1$:\n$$\\Delta N = N_2 - N_1$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta N = 4 - 4 = 0$$\n\nDespite the efficiency gain saving time, it is not sufficient to allow for an additional complete surgical case within the $8$-hour day, due to the discrete nature of the problem. For $N=5$ cases with the reduced turnover, the total time required would be $5 \\times 90 + (5-1) \\times 10 = 450 + 40 = 490$ minutes, which exceeds the available $480$ minutes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "4672071"}, {"introduction": "After planning capacity and optimizing throughput, a surgical leader must understand the financial and administrative value of the work performed.

A Relative Value Unit (RVU) is composed of three parts: physician work RVU, practice expense RVU, and malpractice RVU. Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) factors adjust each component to reflect regional cost variation. For a single Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) service performed in a given region, the geographically adjusted total RVUs are the sum of each component RVU weighted by its corresponding GPCI. Assume procedures are performed in a facility setting (i.e., use facility practice expense RVUs).\n\nConsider a single month in which the service line performs a mix of procedures.

In your derivation, clearly state how the CPT modifier $22$ affects the calculation and explain the implications of your computed total for surgeon compensation models and service-line sustainability based on commonly used administrative frameworks (for example, compensation per work RVU and the role of total RVUs as a proxy for resource use and revenue).", "solution": "The primary task is to calculate the total geographically adjusted Relative Value Units (RVUs) for a surgical service line over a single month. This involves aggregating the RVUs for different procedures, accounting for case volume, geographic cost indices, and a procedural modifier.\n\nFirst, let us establish a general formula for the total geographically adjusted RVU, denoted as $R_{total}$. For a single instance of a given procedure, the geographically adjusted RVU, $R$, is the sum of its three components—work ($w$), practice expense ($p$), and malpractice ($m$)—each multiplied by its respective Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) factor ($\\gamma_w$, $\\gamma_p$, $\\gamma_m$):\n$$R = w \\gamma_w + p \\gamma_p + m \\gamma_m$$\n\nTo find the total for a mix of procedures over a period, we sum the RVUs for every case performed. Let the index $i$ denote a specific type of procedure. For each procedure type $i$, we are given the base RVU components ($w_i$, $p_i$, $m_i$) and the number of cases performed, $n_i$. The total geographically adjusted RVUs for the service line can be expressed as the sum over all procedure types:\n$$R_{total} = \\sum_{i} n_i (w_i \\gamma_w + p_i \\gamma_p + m_i \\gamma_m)$$\nBy rearranging the sums, this can be written as:\n$$R_{total} = \\gamma_w \\left(\\sum_{i} n_i w_i\\right) + \\gamma_p \\left(\\sum_{i} n_i p_i\\right) + \\gamma_m \\left(\\sum_{i} n_i m_i\\right)$$\nThis expression shows that the total is the sum of the geographically adjusted total work, total practice expense, and total malpractice RVUs. Let us denote the total unadjusted component RVUs as $W_{total}$, $P_{total}$, and $M_{total}$ respectively.\n$$W_{total} = \\sum_{i} n_i w_i$$\n$$P_{total} = \\sum_{i} n_i p_i$$\n$$M_{total} = \\sum_{i} n_i m_i$$\nSo, $R_{total} = \\gamma_w W_{total} + \\gamma_p P_{total} + \\gamma_m M_{total}$.\n\nA special condition applies to the open right hemicolectomy cases. Of the $n_2 = 15$ cases, $n_{2,mod} = 3$ cases had a CPT modifier $22$, which \"increases only the work component by $0.20$\". This is interpreted as a $20\\%$ increase in the work RVU value. Therefore, for these $3$ modified cases, the work RVU is $w_{2,mod} = w_2(1 + 0.20) = 1.2 w_2$. The remaining $n_{2,std} = 15 - 3 = 12$ cases have the standard work RVU, $w_2$. The practice expense and malpractice components are unaffected for all $15$ cases.\n\nThe total unadjusted work RVU, $W_{total}$, must account for this modification. Let's designate the procedures as follows: $1$ = Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, $2$ = Open right hemicolectomy, $3$ = Inguinal hernia repair, $4$ = Thyroid lobectomy.

For this month, $W_{total} = 1035.0$. In many productivity-based compensation models, surgeons are paid a set dollar amount per work RVU (wRVU) generated, often after a certain threshold is met. The total of $1035.0$ wRVUs represents the collective productivity of the service line's surgeons, and it forms the basis for distributing compensation. The inclusion of the CPT modifier $22$ for the more complex hemicolectomy cases increased the total wRVUs from what they would have been otherwise, demonstrating that proper documentation of increased service intensity directly translates to higher measured productivity and potential compensation.\n\n2.  **Service-Line Sustainability:** The total geographically adjusted RVU, $R_{total} \\approx 1905$, serves as a proxy for total revenue generation. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, use a national dollar conversion factor (CF) to translate total RVUs into payment. The payment for this case mix would be approximately $R_{total} \\times CF$. Service-line sustainability is determined by the balance between these revenues and the total costs of service delivery. The RVU system's structure provides a framework for this analysis:\n    *   The geographically adjusted work component ($1076.4$ RVUs) generates revenue intended to cover surgeon compensation.\n    *   The geographically adjusted practice expense component ($637.236$ RVUs) generates revenue to cover non-physician operational costs, such as nursing and technical staff salaries, facility overhead, equipment, and supplies. The regional GPCI of $\\gamma_p = 0.93$ indicates that these costs are estimated to be $7\\%$ lower than the national average, and reimbursement is adjusted accordingly.\n    *   The geographically adjusted malpractice component ($191.716$ RVUs) generates revenue to cover the cost of professional liability insurance. The GPCI of $\\gamma_m = 0.82$ reflects a lower-cost malpractice environment in this region.\nA service line is financially sustainable if the revenues derived from these RVU components are sufficient to cover their corresponding actual costs. Therefore, the calculated total RVU and its components are fundamental inputs for financial planning, budgeting, and performance evaluation in healthcare administration.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1905}\n$$", "id": "4672001"}]}
