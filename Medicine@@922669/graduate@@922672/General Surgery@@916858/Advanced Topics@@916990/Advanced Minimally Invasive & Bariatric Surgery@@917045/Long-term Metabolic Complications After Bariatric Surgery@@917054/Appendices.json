Consider apical uptake mediated by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1).

It is scientifically grounded in the principle of mass conservation, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of a mass-balance model for the exchangeable extracellular calcium pool and its application to calculate the net bone calcium flux, $B$. The fundamental principle governing this system is the conservation of mass. The problem states that the system is at a steady state over the timescale of days. In a steady state, the total mass of the substance of interest—in this case, calcium—within the defined system remains constant. This implies that the rate of change of calcium mass in the exchangeable pool is zero.\n\nThe rate of change of calcium mass, $\\frac{dM_{\\text{Ca}}}{dt}$, can be expressed as the sum of all fluxes into the pool minus the sum of all fluxes out of the pool.\n$$\n\\frac{dM_{\\text{Ca}}}{dt} = \\sum (\\text{Fluxes in}) - \\sum (\\text{Fluxes out})\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dM_{\\text{Ca}}}{dt} = 0$, which leads to the mass balance equation:\n$$\n\\sum (\\text{Fluxes in}) = \\sum (\\text{Fluxes out})\n$$\nThe fluxes described in the problem are:\n1.

Net bone calcium flux, $B$: This term represents the net exchange between the bone and the extracellular pool. According to the problem's sign convention, a positive $B$ signifies net resorption (calcium moving from bone into the pool), making it an influx. A negative $B$ signifies net accretion (calcium moving from the pool into bone), making it an efflux. We can treat $B$ as a single term representing a net flux, which is positive for influx and negative for efflux.\n\nWe can express the steady-state mass balance by summing all fluxes into a single equation, setting the total to zero.
