According to the provided surgical principle, a circumferential overlap of $o$ increases each linear dimension of the defect by $2o$ to determine the final dimensions of the mesh. This is because the overlap is applied to both sides of each axis. For the width, the overlap is added to the left and right sides. For the height, the overlap is added to the superior and inferior sides.\n\nThe width of the mesh, $w_m$, is therefore the width of the defect plus twice the overlap:\n$$w_m = w_d + 2o$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$w_m = 10\\,\\text{cm} + 2 \\times 5\\,\\text{cm} = 10\\,\\text{cm} + 10\\,\\text{cm} = 20\\,\\text{cm}$$\nSimilarly, the height of the mesh, $h_m$, is the height of the defect plus twice the overlap:\n$$h_m = h_d + 2o$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$h_m = 12\\,\\text{cm} + 2 \\times 5\\,\\text{cm} = 12\\,\\text{cm} + 10\\,\\text{cm} = 22\\,\\text{cm}$$\nThe required area of the mesh, $A_m$, is determined by the fundamental geometric formula for the area of a rectangle, $A = w \\times h$.
