The final numerical answer must be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The principles of linear proportionality of fluorescence for dilute concentrations and the Beer-Lambert law for light attenuation in a turbid medium like biological tissue are fundamental concepts in biophotonics. The use of ICG, NIR light, and the given physical parameters (tissue thickness, attenuation coefficient) are all realistic for the application of fluorescence-guided cholecystectomy. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nBased on the principles provided, we can formulate the mathematical model for the detected fluorescence intensity, $I_{\\text{detected}}$.\n\nFirst, the statement that fluorescence intensity is linearly proportional to concentration can be written as:\n$$I_{\\text{source}} = k \\cdot C$$\nwhere $I_{\\text{source}}$ is the fluorescence intensity generated at the source (the bile duct), $C$ is the fluorophore concentration, and $k$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the excitation light intensity, quantum yield of the fluorophore, and the geometry and sensitivity of the detection system.\n\nSecond, the transmission of this fluorescence signal through a layer of tissue of thickness $d$ is governed by exponential attenuation. The detected intensity $I_{\\text{detected}}$ is the source intensity multiplied by the transmission factor $T$:\n$$I_{\\text{detected}} = I_{\\text{source}} \\cdot T$$\nThe transmission factor $T$ is given by the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$T = \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{eff}} d)$$\nCombining these equations, we get the full expression for the detected intensity:\n$$I_{\\text{detected}} = (k \\cdot C) \\cdot \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{eff}} d)$$\n\nWe must first determine the proportionality constant $k$ using the normalization condition provided. The condition states that for no overlying tissue ($d=0$) and a concentration $C_{0} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the detected intensity is $I_{0} = 1\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$.\nIn this case, the attenuation term $\\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot 0) = \\exp(0) = 1$. So the equation simplifies to:\n$$I_{0} = k \\cdot C_{0}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{a.u.} = k \\cdot (1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})$$\nFrom this, we solve for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}}{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 1\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{a.u.}}{\\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\n\nNow we can use this value of $k$ to solve the main problem. We are given:\n-   Concentration: $C = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   Tissue thickness: $d = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n-   Effective attenuation coefficient: $\\mu_{\\text{eff}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless optical depth, which is the argument of the exponential function:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{eff}} d = (2\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 0.6$$\nNow, we substitute all values into the full expression for $I_{\\text{detected}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{detected}} = \\left(1\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{a.u.}}{\\mu\\mathrm{M}} \\cdot 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\right) \\cdot \\exp(-0.6)$$\n$$I_{\\text{detected}} = (2\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}) \\cdot \\exp(-0.6)$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$\\exp(-0.6) \\approx 0.548811635$$\n$$I_{\\text{detected}} \\approx 2 \\cdot 0.548811635\\,\\mathrm{a.u.} \\approx 1.09762327\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$I_{\\text{detected}} \\approx 1.098\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to briefly comment on the practical visibility of this signal. The attenuation factor is $T = \\exp(-0.6) \\approx 0.5488$. This signifies that approximately $54.9\\%$ of the source fluorescence signal is transmitted through the $0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ of adipose tissue, while about $45.1\\%$ is absorbed or scattered away from the detector. The resulting signal of $1.098\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$ is of the same order of magnitude as the reference signal ($1\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$ from $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ with no tissue). Assuming the detection system has a noise floor significantly lower than $1\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$, a signal of this strength would be clearly distinguishable from background noise. Therefore, the signal magnitude suggests practical visibility is achievable under these conditions, supporting the feasibility of fluorescence-guided surgery through moderate thicknesses of adipose tissue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.098}$$", "id": "4625728"}, {"introduction": "Once a fluorescent signal is detected, the critical next step is to determine if it is strong and clear enough for confident surgical decision-making.

No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of signal detection theory and its application to medical imaging, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the application of Signal Detection Theory (SDT) to a binary classification task in a medical imaging context. We are asked to distinguish between two classes of pixels: those corresponding to a perfused Region of Interest (ROI) and those corresponding to a non-perfused background (BG).\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the pixel intensities for these two classes are modeled by Gaussian distributions with equal variance. Let $I_{ROI}$ and $I_{BG}$ be the random variables representing the measured pixel intensities for the ROI and background, respectively. Their distributions are given by:\n$$ I_{ROI} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{ROI}, \\sigma^2) $$\n$$ I_{BG} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{BG}, \\sigma^2) $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ denotes a normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. The problem provides the following values:\nThe mean intensity of the ROI is $\\mu_{ROI} = 500$ a.u.\nThe mean intensity of the background is $\\mu_{BG} = 200$ a.u.\nThe standard deviation of the additive Gaussian noise, common to both distributions, is $\\sigma = 50$ a.u.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression for the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) starting from the definition of the detectability index, $d'$. The problem states that $d'$ is defined as the standardized separation of the class means. For two Gaussian distributions with means $\\mu_{ROI}$ and $\\mu_{BG}$ and a common standard deviation $\\sigma$, this is formally expressed as the absolute difference between the means divided by their common standard deviation:\n$$ d' = \\frac{|\\mu_{ROI} - \\mu_{BG}|}{\\sigma} $$\nThis index $d'$ quantifies how separated the two distributions are in units of their standard deviation, providing a measure of how well an ideal observer can distinguish signals from the two classes.\n\nNext, we consider the definition of Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) as it is used in imaging science. CNR is a metric that quantifies image quality and the visibility of a feature. It is defined as the ratio of the contrast of the feature against its background to the level of noise.\nThe contrast, $C$, is the absolute difference in the mean signal intensities between the feature (ROI) and the background.\n$$ C = |\\mu_{ROI} - \\mu_{BG}| $$\nThe noise, $N$, is quantified by the standard deviation of the signal fluctuations. The problem states that this is measured from a uniform patch and is given as $\\sigma$.\n$$ N = \\sigma $$\nTherefore, the CNR is defined as:\n$$ \\text{CNR} = \\frac{C}{N} = \\frac{|\\mu_{ROI} - \\mu_{BG}|}{\\sigma} $$\nBy comparing the expressions, we see that for the given assumptions of equal-variance Gaussian classes, the detectability index $d'$ is identical to the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio.\n$$ \\text{CNR} \\equiv d' = \\frac{|\\mu_{ROI} - \\mu_{BG}|}{\\sigma} $$\nThis completes the derivation of the CNR expression from the fundamental principles of SDT.\n\nThe second task is to compute the numerical value of the CNR for the given measurements. We substitute the provided values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\mu_{ROI} = 500 $$\n$$ \\mu_{BG} = 200 $$\n$$ \\sigma = 50 $$\n$$ \\text{CNR} = \\frac{|500 - 200|}{50} = \\frac{300}{50} = 6 $$\nThe resulting CNR is a dimensionless quantity, as the units of arbitrary intensity (a.u.) in the numerator and denominator cancel.\n\nThe final task is to evaluate whether the commonly used detection criterion $\\text{CNR} > 3$ is met. Our computed value is $\\text{CNR} = 6$.\nSince $6 > 3$, the detection criterion is indeed met under these conditions. The high CNR value indicates a strong separation between the signal distributions of the perfused and non-perfused tissues, allowing for reliable discrimination.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "4625752"}, {"introduction": "The process of generating fluorescence requires illuminating tissue with an external light source, making patient safety a paramount concern.
