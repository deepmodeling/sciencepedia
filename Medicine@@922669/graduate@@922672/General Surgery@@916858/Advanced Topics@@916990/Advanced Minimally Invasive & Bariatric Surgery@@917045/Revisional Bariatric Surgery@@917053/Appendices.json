This is defined as the ratio of the total weight lost to the initial excess weight.\n\n$EWL = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{lost}}}{W_{\\mathrm{excess}}}$\n\nFirst, we must derive expressions for the numerator, $W_{\\mathrm{lost}}$, and the denominator, $W_{\\mathrm{excess}}$, from the provided data.\n\nThe total weight lost, $W_{\\mathrm{lost}}$, is the difference between the preoperative weight, $W_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, and the current weight, $W_{\\mathrm{current}}$.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{lost}} = W_{\\mathrm{pre}} - W_{\\mathrm{current}}$$\n\nThe initial excess weight, $W_{\\mathrm{excess}}$, is defined as the difference between the preoperative weight and the ideal weight, $W_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{excess}} = W_{\\mathrm{pre}} - W_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$$\n\nThe ideal weight, $W_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$, is not given directly but must be calculated from the target Body Mass Index, $BMI^{\\ast}$, and the patient's height, $h$. The definition provided is $BMI^{\\ast} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{ideal}}}{h^{2}}$. Rearranging this equation to solve for $W_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$ gives:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{ideal}} = BMI^{\\ast} \\times h^{2}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $W_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$ into the equation for $W_{\\mathrm{excess}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{excess}} = W_{\\mathrm{pre}} - (BMI^{\\ast} \\times h^{2})$$\n\nNow, we can assemble the final expression for $EWL$ by substituting the expressions for $W_{\\mathrm{lost}}$ and $W_{\\mathrm{excess}}$:\n$$EWL = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{pre}} - W_{\\mathrm{current}}}{W_{\\mathrm{pre}} - (BMI^{\\ast} \\times h^{2})}$$\nThis equation expresses $EWL$ derived from the first principles and given variables.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expressions.\nGiven:\n- $h = 1.70\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 140\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{current}} = 115\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $BMI^{\\ast} = 25$ (dimensionless, conventionally $\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^2$)\n\nFirst, calculate the patient's ideal weight, $W_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{ideal}} = 25 \\times (1.70)^{2} = 25 \\times 2.89 = 72.25\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\n\nNext, calculate the initial excess weight, $W_{\\mathrm{excess}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{excess}} = W_{\\mathrm{pre}} - W_{\\mathrm{ideal}} = 140 - 72.25 = 67.75\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\n\nThen, calculate the total weight lost, $W_{\\mathrm{lost}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{lost}} = W_{\\mathrm{pre}} - W_{\\mathrm{current}} = 140 - 115 = 25\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\n\nFinally, compute the proportion of excess weight lost, $EWL$:\n$$EWL = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{lost}}}{W_{\\mathrm{excess}}} = \\frac{25}{67.75}$$\n$$EWL \\approx 0.36900369...$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$EWL \\approx 0.3690$$\n\n### Assessment Against Failure Threshold\nThe problem asks to assess whether the commonly used failure threshold of $0.500$ is met.

The solution proceeds by applying the provided principles and definitions in a logical sequence.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical representation of the conservation of length along the small intestine. The total length of the small bowel, $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of the lengths of its constituent segments: the biliopancreatic limb ($L_{\\mathrm{BPL}}$), the alimentary limb ($L_{\\mathrm{AL}}$), and the common channel ($L_{\\mathrm{CC}}$). This principle is expressed as the equation:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{BPL}} + L_{\\mathrm{AL}} + L_{\\mathrm{CC}} = L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\nFrom this fundamental relationship, we can derive an expression for the length of the common channel, $L_{\\mathrm{CC}}$, which is the segment where nutrient-enzyme mixing and significant absorption occur.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{CC}} = L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - (L_{\\mathrm{BPL}} + L_{\\mathrm{AL}})$$\nThis equation is general and applies to any Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) configuration, including the patient's existing setup and the reference standard.\n\nNext, we formalize the malabsorptive severity index, $M$, which is defined as the fraction of the total small bowel not exposed to nutrient-enzyme mixing. In the RYGB anatomy, the alimentary limb carries ingested nutrients, while the biliopancreatic limb carries digestive enzymes. These two streams are separate until they merge at the start of the common channel. Therefore, the portion of the small bowel not exposed to mixing is the sum of the lengths of these two proximal limbs, $L_{\\mathrm{BPL}} + L_{\\mathrm{AL}}$. The malabsorptive severity index $M$ is this length taken as a fraction of the total small bowel length, $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$M = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{BPL}} + L_{\\mathrm{AL}}}{L_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nWe can denote the index for the patient's current configuration as $M$ and for the standard configuration as $M_{\\mathrm{std}}$. The respective formulae are:\n$$M = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{BPL}} + L_{\\mathrm{AL}}}{L_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\n$$M_{\\mathrm{std}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{BPL,std}} + L_{\\mathrm{AL,std}}}{L_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nThe problem requires the computation of the dimensionless ratio $R = \\frac{M}{M_{\\mathrm{std}}}$.

The expression for $R$ simplifies to:\n$$R = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{BPL}} + L_{\\mathrm{AL}}}{L_{\\mathrm{BPL,std}} + L_{\\mathrm{AL,std}}}$$\nThis simplified form reveals that the relative malabsorption, as defined by this index, depends only on the sum of the lengths of the non-common channel segments.\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\nFor the patient's existing configuration: $L_{\\mathrm{BPL}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{AL}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nFor the standard configuration: $L_{\\mathrm{BPL,std}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{AL,std}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nWe now substitute these values into the derived expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{100 + 150}{50 + 150}$$\nPerforming the addition in the numerator and the denominator:\n$$R = \\frac{250}{200}$$\nFinally, we simplify the fraction to its exact form as requested:\n$$R = \\frac{25}{20} = \\frac{5}{4}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}$$", "id": "4664265"}, {"introduction": "Successfully navigating the postoperative period after a malabsorptive revision requires a sophisticated approach to nutritional support that goes far beyond generic recommendations.
