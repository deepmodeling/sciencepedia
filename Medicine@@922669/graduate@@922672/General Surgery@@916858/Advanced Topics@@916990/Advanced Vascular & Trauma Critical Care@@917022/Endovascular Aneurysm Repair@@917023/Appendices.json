The parameters provided are physiologically realistic for the clinical scenario described.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for circumferential (hoop) stress ($\\sigma_{\\theta}$) in a thin-walled cylinder and calculate its value for a given abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\n\n**1. Derivation of Circumferential (Hoop) Stress**\n\nWe model the aneurysmal segment of the aorta as a thin-walled cylinder of radius $r$, wall thickness $t$, and length $L$. The internal blood pressure is $P$. To find the hoop stress, we consider the static equilibrium of forces on one half of the cylinder, as if it were cut by a plane through its longitudinal axis.\n\nThe force exerted by the internal pressure, $F_P$, acts on the projected area of the internal surface. This projected area is a rectangle with dimensions equal to the diameter ($2r$) and the length ($L$) of the segment.\n$$F_P = P \\times (2r L)$$\n\nThis outward-acting pressure force must be balanced by the internal tensile force, $F_\\sigma$, within the cylinder wall. This resisting force is the product of the circumferential stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, and the cross-sectional area of the wall that has been cut. The cut exposes two rectangular cross-sections of the wall, each with an area of $t \\times L$. Therefore, the total resisting area is $2tL$.\n$$F_\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times (2 t L)$$\n\nFor the cylinder to be in static equilibrium, these two forces must be equal:\n$$F_P = F_\\sigma$$\n$$P (2r L) = \\sigma_{\\theta} (2 t L)$$\n\nThe length $L$ and the factor of $2$ cancel from both sides of the equation, yielding the expression for the circumferential (hoop) stress:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{P r}{t}$$\nThis is the Law of Laplace as applied to a cylindrical pressure vessel, also known as Barlow's formula.\n\n**2. Calculation of Hoop Stress**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- Radius: $r = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm} = 0.030 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Wall thickness: $t = 0.3 \\ \\mathrm{cm} = 0.003 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Internal pressure: $P = 160 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nFirst, we must convert the pressure from millimeters of mercury ($\\mathrm{mmHg}$) to the SI unit of Pascal ($\\mathrm{Pa}$). The standard conversion is based on $1 \\ \\mathrm{atm} = 760 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 101325 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$P = 160 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} \\times \\frac{101325 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}}{760 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}} \\approx 21331.5789 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of $P$, $r$, and $t$ into the derived stress formula:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{P r}{t} = \\frac{(160 \\times \\frac{101325}{760} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (0.030 \\ \\mathrm{m})}{0.003 \\ \\mathrm{m}}$$\n\nThe ratio of radius to thickness is $\\frac{r}{t} = \\frac{0.030 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.003 \\ \\mathrm{m}} = 10$. This confirms the applicability of the thin-wall assumption, as the ratio is typically required to be $\\ge 10$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\left(160 \\times \\frac{101325}{760}\\right) \\times 10 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} \\approx 213315.789 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$). Since $1 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} \\approx \\frac{213315.789}{10^6} \\ \\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 0.213315789 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} \\approx 0.2133 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$\n\n**3.

We rearrange the equation algebraically:\n$$O_f \\cdot D_{neck} = D_{device} - D_{neck}$$\n$$D_{device} = D_{neck} + O_f \\cdot D_{neck}$$\n\nFactoring out $D_{neck}$ from the right-hand side yields the final expression for the nominal device diameter:\n$$D_{device} = D_{neck} (1 + O_f)$$\n\nThe explicit assumptions made in this calculation are:\n1.

The definition of fractional oversizing given in the problem is the sole basis for the calculation.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n$D_{neck} = 24$\n$O_f = 0.15$\n\n$$D_{device} = 24 \\cdot (1 + 0.15)$$\n$$D_{device} = 24 \\cdot (1.15)$$\n$$D_{device} = 27.6$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $27.6$ already has three significant figures. The units are millimeters.\n\n**Part 2: Qualitative Discussion of Risks in a Calcified Neck**\n\nApplying the calculated oversizing of $0.15$ (or $15\\%$) in an aortic neck with heavy circumferential calcification introduces significant biomechanical and clinical risks. These risks stem from the fundamental alteration of the aortic wall's material properties caused by calcification.\n\nA healthy aortic wall is a viscoelastic composite material, with its mechanical behavior dominated by elastin and collagen fibers. It is compliant and can expand elastically to accommodate an oversized stent-graft. The radial force exerted by the device ($F_{radial}$) induces a circumferential stress ($\\sigma_{\\theta}$) in the aortic wall. According to the law of Laplace for a thin-walled cylinder, this stress leads to an increase in radius (strain), allowing the wall to conform to the device. This elastic recoil of the aortic wall back onto the graft is critical for generating the frictional and sealing forces necessary to prevent device migration and Type Ia endoleak (perigraft flow at the proximal attachment site).\n\nHeavy circumferential calcification fundamentally changes this behavior. Calcific plaques are depositions of calcium minerals, primarily hydroxyapatite, which are orders of magnitude stiffer and more brittle than the native aortic tissue. The Young's modulus of a calcified plaque can be several GPa, whereas that of a healthy aortic wall is in the range of MPa. This has several adverse consequences:\n\n1.  **Risk of Ineffective Seal (Type Ia Endoleak):** A heavily calcified neck loses its compliance. It cannot and will not deform elastically to conform to the circular profile of the expanded stent-graft. The rigid, often irregular, calcified ring creates gutters and channels between the graft fabric and the vessel wall. Blood can flow through these channels under systemic pressure into the aneurysm sac, resulting in a Type Ia endoleak. This negates the primary goal of the procedure, leaving the aneurysm pressurized and at risk of rupture.\n\n2.  **Risk of Aortic Injury:** Applying a significant radial force from a $15\\%$ oversized device onto a brittle, non-compliant structure is mechanically hazardous. Instead of inducing elastic strain, the concentrated stress can exceed the fracture toughness of the calcified wall. This can lead to plaque fracture, vessel dissection, or even contained or free rupture of the aortic neck. Such an iatrogenic injury at the proximal sealing zone is a life-threatening emergency. The force from the graft acts as a stress concentrator on the irregular, sharp edges of the calcified plaques, increasing the likelihood of mechanical failure.\n\n3.  **Risk of Device Migration:** A secure seal relies on both sufficient radial force and friction between the graft and the aortic wall. A calcified neck may not allow the stent-graft's barbs or anchors to adequately penetrate and engage the vessel wall. The poor apposition and non-conforming interface can lead to an inadequate frictional force to counteract the pulsatile hemodynamic drag forces exerted by blood flow. This increases the long-term risk of the device migrating distally, which would result in a loss of the proximal seal and recurrent pressurization of the aneurysm.\n\nIn clinical practice, heavy circumferential neck calcification is a primary component of \"hostile neck anatomy\" and is a well-documented predictor of EVAR failure. The presence of such calcification often compels surgeons to consider alternative strategies, such as open surgical repair, the use of specialized fenestrated or branched endografts to achieve a seal in a healthier segment of the aorta, or adjunctive techniques like endoanchors to improve fixation in compromised sealing zones. Simply applying a standard oversizing protocol without accounting for these altered biomechanics is a deviation from sound clinical and engineering principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{27.6}$$", "id": "4619612"}, {"introduction": "While the primary focus of EVAR is on the aneurysm itself, the procedure's success and safety are equally dependent on the successful delivery of the device through the iliofemoral access vessels.

The problem defines this as a fractional clearance $m = 0.15$ *above* the sheath outer diameter. This means the minimal required diameter of the vessel, $D_{\\text{safe}}$, must be the sheath's diameter plus an additional clearance amount. The clearance amount is calculated as the fraction $m$ of the sheath's diameter.\n\nThe required clearance, let's call it $C_L$, is:\n$$C_L = m \\times D_{\\text{sheath}}$$\nThe minimal safe access vessel internal diameter is the sum of the sheath's outer diameter and this clearance.\n$$D_{\\text{safe}} = D_{\\text{sheath}} + C_L$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_L$:\n$$D_{\\text{safe}} = D_{\\text{sheath}} + (m \\times D_{\\text{sheath}})$$\nThis can be expressed in a more compact form by factoring out $D_{\\text{sheath}}$:\n$$D_{\\text{safe}} = D_{\\text{sheath}} (1 + m)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the known numerical values into this equation.
