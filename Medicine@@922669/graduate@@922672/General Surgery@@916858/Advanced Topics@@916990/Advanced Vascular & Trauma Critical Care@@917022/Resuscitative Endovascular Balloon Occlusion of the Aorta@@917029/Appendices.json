This distance, $D_{\\text{fh}\\to \\text{xiphoid}}$, is given by the anthropometric proportion:\n$$D_{\\text{fh}\\to \\text{xiphoid}} = k \\, H$$\nwhere the unitless constant $k$ is given as $k = 0.23$.\nSubstituting the value of $H$:\n$$D_{\\text{fh}\\to \\text{xiphoid}} = 0.23 \\times 175~\\text{cm} = 40.25~\\text{cm}$$\n\nNext, we must adjust this distance to account for the actual target location. The xiphoid process landmark corresponds to the vertebral level of $T9$. The desired target is the mid-body of $T8$. In the spinal column, vertebrae are numbered sequentially from superior (cervical) to inferior (lumbar). Therefore, $T8$ is one vertebral level superior to $T9$. Since the catheter is inserted from the femoral artery and advanced superiorly up the aorta, it must travel past the $T9$ level to reach the $T8$ level.\n\nThe additional distance required to travel from the $T9$ level to the $T8$ level is the height of one thoracic vertebral segment (body plus intervertebral disc). This height, $h_v$, is given by the approximation:\n$$h_v = 0.015 \\, H$$\nSubstituting the value of $H$:\n$$h_v = 0.015 \\times 175~\\text{cm} = 2.625~\\text{cm}$$\n\nThe total external straight-line distance, $D_{\\text{external}}$, from the puncture site to the level of the target at $T8$ is the sum of these two distances:\n$$D_{\\text{external}} = D_{\\text{fh}\\to \\text{xiphoid}} + h_v$$\n$$D_{\\text{external}} = 40.25~\\text{cm} + 2.625~\\text{cm} = 42.875~\\text{cm}$$\n\nFinally, we must account for the fact that the path of the catheter inside the aorta is not a straight line due to vessel curvature and tortuosity. The problem specifies a multiplicative correction factor of $\\alpha=0.04$, which represents a $4\\%$ increase in length over the external straight-line measurement.

Assume the proximal thoracic aorta internal diameter is $25$ mm. The principle of occlusion is that flow cessation occurs when the balloon’s external diameter equals the vessel’s internal diameter at the site of occlusion. The manufacturer’s compliance chart for the chosen occlusion balloon states the following measured diameters $D$ (in mm) for inflation volumes $V$ (in mL), under conditions typical of Zone I placement:\n- At $V = 12$ mL, $D = 23$ mm.\n- At $V = 14$ mL, $D = 26$ mm.\n\nWithin this operating range, model the balloon’s diameter–volume relationship as linear.

The solution involves three primary steps: first, determining the necessary balloon inflation volume to achieve aortic occlusion by using linear interpolation on the provided compliance data; second, calculating the total volume that must be injected by accounting for the system's dead space; and third, applying a specified safety margin to this total volume.\n\nThe given parameters are as follows:\n-   Internal diameter of the proximal thoracic aorta: $D_{\\text{aorta}} = 25$ mm.\n-   Principle of occlusion: The balloon diameter $D_{\\text{balloon}}$ must equal the aortic diameter $D_{\\text{aorta}}$.

This volume must be injected from the syringe before any fluid begins to inflate the balloon. The total volume required to be dispensed from the syringe to achieve occlusion, which we term the occlusive syringe volume $V_{\\text{occlusive}}$, is the sum of the balloon volume and the dead space volume.\n$$V_{\\text{occlusive}} = V_{\\text{balloon}} + V_{\\text{dead}}$$\nTo maintain precision, we express $V_{\\text{dead}}$ as a fraction: $1.2 = \\frac{12}{10} = \\frac{6}{5}$.\n$$V_{\\text{occlusive}} = \\frac{40}{3} + \\frac{6}{5}$$\n$$V_{\\text{occlusive}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 40 + 3 \\cdot 6}{15} = \\frac{200 + 18}{15} = \\frac{218}{15} \\text{ mL}$$\n\nFinally, we apply the safety margin.

Tissue injury from ischemia is approximated by the time integral of a constant territory-specific ischemia rate during complete flow arrest.

This is instantaneous. Splanchnic-renal perfusion is restored.\n3.  **Shunting**: Occurs under Zone III occlusion, starting at $t=18$ min and lasting for $t_{S,III} = 10$ minutes. This phase ends at $t=18+10=28$ min.\n\nThe total duration of Zone I occlusion is simply the time for packing: $T_{I,total} = t_P = 18$ minutes.\nThis is valid, as $18 \\text{ min} \\le T_{I,\\max} = 25 \\text{ min}$.\n\nAt $t=28$ minutes, both packing and shunting are complete, and the balloon is deflated.
