Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is a recognized biomarker for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The definition provided is the standard operational definition used in clinical practice. The values for exome capture size ($35$ Mb) and the number of mutations ($350$) are realistic for cutaneous melanoma, which is known for its high mutational load due to ultraviolet radiation exposure.

The solution process will proceed.\n\n**Solution**\nThe primary task is to compute the Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) for the given specimen and evaluate it against a specified clinical threshold.\n\nThe problem explicitly defines TMB as the number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations per megabase of the interrogated coding sequence. Let $N_{mut}$ represent the number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations and $L_{coding}$ represent the length of the captured coding region in megabases (Mb). The formula for TMB is therefore:\n$$ \\text{TMB} = \\frac{N_{mut}}{L_{coding}} $$\n\nThe units of TMB will be mutations per megabase (mut/Mb). From the problem statement, we have the following values:\n- $N_{mut} = 350$\n- $L_{coding} = 35$ Mb\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{TMB} = \\frac{350}{35} \\text{ mut/Mb} $$\n\nPerforming the division yields the exact value for the TMB:\n$$ \\text{TMB} = 10 \\text{ mut/Mb} $$\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine whether this calculated TMB meets the immunotherapy consideration threshold. The threshold is given as $\\geq 10$ mut/Mb.\n\nWe compare the calculated TMB to the threshold:\nCalculated TMB: $10$ mut/Mb.\nThreshold: $\\geq 10$ mut/Mb.\n\nThe condition to be checked is $10 \\geq 10$. This inequality is true. Therefore, the TMB for this specimen meets the specified threshold for consideration of PD-1 blockade immunotherapy.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the TMB as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "4631856"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient is deemed a candidate for immunotherapy, the next step is to determine the optimal dosing regimen. This exercise moves beyond simple patient selection to the practical application of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The team is deciding between a fixed (flat) dosing regimen and a weight-based dosing regimen for perioperative scheduling, aiming to balance exposure variability and clinical practicality.\n\nUse the following well-tested pharmacokinetic foundations for monoclonal antibodies: for linear, time-invariant kinetics with negligible target-mediated disposition at therapeutic exposures, the Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve over a dosing interval (AUC) satisfies $AUC_{\\tau} = \\dfrac{Dose}{CL}$, and the steady-state average concentration over the interval satisfies $\\bar{C}_{ss} = \\dfrac{Dose}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$, where $CL$ is clearance and $\\tau$ is the dosing interval length.

First, we calculate the patient-specific pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure metrics ($AUC_{\\tau}$ and $\\bar{C}_{ss}$) for the proposed dosing regimens. Second, we evaluate these quantitative results in the context of the stated pharmacodynamic principles and practical constraints to determine the optimal approach.\n\n**1. Pharmacokinetic Calculations**\n\n**a. Patient-Specific Clearance ($CL$)**\nThe clearance ($CL$) of the monoclonal antibody scales allometrically with body weight ($WT$). The patient's weight is given as $WT = 120\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. The allometric scaling equation for clearance is:\n$$CL = CL_{70}\\left(\\dfrac{WT}{70}\\right)^{0.75}$$\nUsing the provided reference clearance for a $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ individual, $CL_{70} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{L/day}$:\n$$CL = (0.20\\,\\mathrm{L/day}) \\left(\\dfrac{120\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{70\\,\\mathrm{kg}}\\right)^{0.75}$$\n$$CL \\approx (0.20\\,\\mathrm{L/day}) \\left(1.7143\\right)^{0.75} \\approx (0.20\\,\\mathrm{L/day}) \\left(1.5053\\right)$$\n$$CL \\approx 0.301\\,\\mathrm{L/day}$$\nThis increased clearance in the heavier patient is a key factor in the subsequent exposure analysis.\n\n**b. Exposure Metrics for Dosing Regimens**\nWe will compare the key regimens based on the area under the concentration-time curve over a dosing interval, $AUC_{\\tau} = \\dfrac{Dose}{CL}$, and the average steady-state concentration, $\\bar{C}_{ss} = \\dfrac{AUC_{\\tau}}{\\tau} = \\dfrac{Dose}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$.\n\n**Regimen 1: Fixed Dose ($200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $3$ weeks)**\n- $Dose = 200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Dosing interval $\\tau = 3\\,\\mathrm{weeks} = 21\\,\\mathrm{days}$\n- $AUC_{\\tau, 1} = \\dfrac{200\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{0.301\\,\\mathrm{L/day}} \\approx 664.5\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot day/L}$\n- $\\bar{C}_{ss, 1} = \\dfrac{200\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{(0.301\\,\\mathrm{L/day}) \\cdot (21\\,\\mathrm{days})} \\approx 31.6\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n\n**Regimen 2: Weight-Based Dose ($2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ every $3$ weeks)**\n- $Dose = (2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}) \\cdot (120\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 240\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Dosing interval $\\tau = 3\\,\\mathrm{weeks} = 21\\,\\mathrm{days}$\n- $AUC_{\\tau, 2} = \\dfrac{240\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{0.301\\,\\mathrm{L/day}} \\approx 797.3\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot day/L}$\n- $\\bar{C}_{ss, 2} = \\dfrac{240\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{(0.301\\,\\mathrm{L/day}) \\cdot (21\\,\\mathrm{days})} \\approx 38.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n\n**Regimen 3: Alternative Fixed Dose ($400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $6$ weeks)**\n- $Dose = 400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Dosing interval $\\tau = 6\\,\\mathrm{weeks} = 42\\,\\mathrm{days}$\n- The dose rate is $\\dfrac{400\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{42\\,\\mathrm{days}} \\approx 9.52\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n- The dose rate for Regimen 1 is $\\dfrac{200\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{21\\,\\mathrm{days}} \\approx 9.52\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n- Since $\\bar{C}_{ss}$ is proportional to the dose rate ($Dose/\\tau$), the average steady-state concentration for this regimen is identical to Regimen 1:\n- $\\bar{C}_{ss, 3} = \\dfrac{400\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{(0.301\\,\\mathrm{L/day}) \\cdot (42\\,\\mathrm{days})} \\approx 31.6\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n\n**2. Interpretation and Comparative Analysis**\n\n**Exposure Comparison:** For this $120\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ patient, the weight-based dose of $240\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ results in approximately $20\\%$ higher exposure (both $AUC_{\\tau}$ and $\\bar{C}_{ss}$) compared to the fixed dose of $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. The $400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $6$ weeks regimen provides the same average exposure as the $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $3$ weeks regimen.\n\n**Clinical Principles:** The problem states two crucial principles:\n1.  **Efficacy Plateau:** Pembrolizumab exhibits a plateau in efficacy, meaning that above a certain exposure threshold, further increases in concentration do not yield a greater therapeutic effect. The fixed $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ dose has been shown to be effective across a wide range of body weights, indicating that the resulting exposures, even at higher weights, are on this efficacy plateau. Therefore, the lower exposure with the fixed dose is not clinically significant in terms of efficacy.\n2.  **Toxicity Profile:** Toxicity does not scale proportionally with modest exposure differences. The $20\\%$ higher exposure from weight-based dosing is unlikely to cause a clinically meaningful increase in toxicity.\n\n**Practical Considerations:**\n1.  **Vial Preparation and Waste:** Pembrolizumab is supplied in $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials.\n    - Fixed dose ($200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$): Requires exactly two $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials. This is efficient, simple, and minimizes cost and waste.\n    - Weight-based dose ($240\\,\\mathrm{mg}$): Requires three $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials, with $60\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of the drug being discarded. This increases complexity, cost, and is wasteful.\n2.  **Neoadjuvant Timeline:** Therapy is given for a short duration before surgery. A $3$-week cycle allows for more frequent patient monitoring and greater flexibility in scheduling surgery compared to a $6$-week cycle. This is an important consideration in the perioperative setting.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Use fixed $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $3$ weeks; exposure differences versus weight-based dosing are modest, remain on the efficacy plateau, and fixed dosing reduces preparation complexity and waste.**\nThis statement accurately synthesizes the analysis. The exposure difference is modest ($\\approx 20\\%$). Given the efficacy plateau, this difference is clinically non-impactful for efficacy. The fixed dose is vastly superior from a practical standpoint, avoiding the waste and extra cost associated with dosing $240\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ from $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials. This approach correctly balances all specified factors.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Use weight-based $2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ every $3$ weeks to match clearance scaling with weight and prevent underexposure in obesity.**\nThis option correctly notes that weight-based dosing aims to match clearance scaling. However, the phrase \"prevent underexposure\" is misleading. It implies the fixed dose is sub-therapeutic, which contradicts the principle of the efficacy plateau. Furthermore, this option completely ignores the significant practical disadvantages of drug wastage and increased cost.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use fixed $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ but extend the interval to every $4$ weeks to normalize exposure for the higher clearance in obesity.**\nThis is pharmacokinetically illogical. The patient has higher clearance, which leads to lower drug exposure for a given dose. To \"normalize\" (increase) the exposure, one would need to increase the dose or *decrease* the dosing interval. Extending the interval from $\\tau = 3$ weeks to $\\tau=4$ weeks would further *decrease* the average concentration ($\\bar{C}_{ss}$), achieving the opposite of the stated goal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use weight-based $3\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ every $3$ weeks to compensate for nonlinear clearance and ensure an adequate exposure margin.**\nThis option is flawed on two counts. First, it proposes a rationale of \"nonlinear clearance,\" which directly contradicts the problem's premise of \"linear, time-invariant kinetics.\" Second, a $3\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ dose ($360\\,\\mathrm{mg}$) would provide even higher exposure with no evidence of benefit and exacerbate the drug wastage issue (requiring four vials and wasting $40\\,\\mathrm{mg}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Use fixed $400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $6$ weeks because it provides equivalent exposure to $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $3$ weeks and is equally practical in the neoadjuvant surgical timeline.**\nThe first part is correct: it provides equivalent *average* exposure ($\\bar{C}_{ss}$). The second part, claiming it is \"equally practical,\" is questionable. For neoadjuvant therapy preceding surgery, a shorter $3$-week cycle length offers more frequent clinical evaluations and greater flexibility for surgical planning than a $6$-week cycle. Therefore, it is arguably less practical in this specific context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn conclusion, the fixed $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $3$ weeks regimen provides a clinically effective exposure that lies on the efficacy plateau, while being the most practical and cost-effective option by eliminating drug wastage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4631839"}, {"introduction": "Assessing response to immunotherapy presents unique challenges due to phenomena like pseudoprogression, where a tumor may transiently appear to grow before shrinking.

The core principles needed are:\n\n- Under Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version $1.1$, the overall response categorization integrates: target lesion response (based on changes in the sum of diameters), non-target lesion assessment (progression by unequivocal increase), and the appearance of new lesions (which, in classic RECIST, immediately indicates progressive disease).\n- Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) modifies RECIST to account for atypical immune response patterns (e.g., pseudoprogression). In iRECIST:\n  - Initial evidence of progression is designated immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD).\n  - Confirmation of progression (immune confirmed progressive disease, iCPD) requires a subsequent assessment showing further progression compared to the iUPD timepoint (e.g., additional increase in the sum of target lesions of at least $20\\%$ from nadir with an absolute increase of at least $5$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, increase in size or number of new lesions totaling at least $5$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions).\n  - New measurable lesions are recorded and summed separately; their initial appearance leads to iUPD, not immediate iCPD.\n  - If the patient is clinically stable at iUPD, continuation of therapy beyond progression with repeat imaging in approximately $4$–$8$ weeks is recommended to confirm progression or document response.\n\nStep $1$: Quantify the target lesion change. Baseline sum of target lesions $=$ $120$ $\\mathrm{mm}$; current sum $=$ $90$ $\\mathrm{mm}$. The proportional change is\n$$\n\\frac{120 - 90}{120} = \\frac{30}{120} = 0.25 = 25\\%.\n$$\nUnder RECIST version $1.1$, a partial response requires a decrease of at least $30\\%$ from baseline. Here, the decrease is $25\\%$, which does not meet the threshold for partial response. Absent any other progression signals, the target lesion component would be consistent with stable disease.\n\nStep $2$: Account for the new lesion. A new measurable lesion of $8$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ appears. Under classic RECIST version $1.1$, any new lesion results in progressive disease at that time point. Under iRECIST, the initial appearance of new lesions triggers immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD), not confirmed progression. The new lesion should be measured, and the sum of new lesions should be tracked for confirmation criteria at the next scan.\n\nStep $3$: Integrate non-target lesions and clinical status. Non-target disease is stable without unequivocal progression, and the patient is clinically stable. iRECIST advises that clinically stable patients with iUPD may continue immunotherapy beyond progression pending confirmation on a subsequent assessment, typically in $4$–$8$ weeks.\n\nConclusion: The correct categorization at this timepoint is iUPD (due to the new lesion), with continuation of therapy and a plan for confirmation imaging to determine whether progression is confirmed (iCPD) or the patient reclassifies to immune stable disease (iSD) or immune partial response (iPR) if tumor burden decreases further or new lesion regresses.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: Immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD) due to the new measurable lesion; continue therapy and repeat imaging in $4$–$8$ weeks to confirm progression versus response. This precisely matches iRECIST rules: initial new lesion appearance leads to iUPD; if clinically stable, treatment may continue beyond progression with planned confirmation. Verdict — Correct.\n\n- Option B: Immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD) because any new lesion represents confirmed progression; discontinue therapy. This statement reflects classic RECIST version $1.1$ logic but contradicts iRECIST, which requires confirmation of progression beyond iUPD. A single new lesion at first detection does not constitute iCPD. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: Immune partial response (iPR) because the sum of target lesions decreased by $25\\%$; continue therapy. iPR requires at least a $30\\%$ decrease from baseline. A $25\\%$ decrease does not meet iPR; furthermore, the new lesion precludes categorization as response at this timepoint under iRECIST and mandates iUPD. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: Immune stable disease (iSD) because the decrease is less than $30\\%$ and non-target disease is stable; continue therapy and ignore the new lesion. Ignoring the new lesion is incompatible with iRECIST; the new lesion causes iUPD, not iSD. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option E: Immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD), but treat as response given target lesion shrinkage and forego confirmation imaging. Although iUPD is correct for categorization, management guidance is incorrect: iRECIST emphasizes confirmation on follow-up imaging to differentiate true progression from pseudoprogression. Foregoing confirmation is not appropriate. Verdict — Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4631794"}]}
