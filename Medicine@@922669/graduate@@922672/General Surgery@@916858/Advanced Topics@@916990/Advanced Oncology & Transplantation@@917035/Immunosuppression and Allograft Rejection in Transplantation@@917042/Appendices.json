For patients who have been previously sensitized, the presence of pre-formed anti-HLA antibodies creates a significant immunological barrier. This practice exercise challenges you to quantify this barrier by calculating the Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA), a critical metric that predicts the likelihood of finding a compatible donor and directly influences a patient's waiting time and pre-transplant management strategy [@problem_id:4631435].", "problem": "An adult kidney transplant candidate has developed circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies against selected Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I and class II antigens, rendering those antigens unacceptable for donor selection. The calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA) is used to quantify the fraction of potential donors in the relevant pool who would be immunologically incompatible solely due to expression of any unacceptable antigen. In the context of general surgery and transplantation immunology, start from the following foundational facts:\n- Allograft antibody-mediated rejection occurs when the recipient has preformed donor-specific antibodies targeting donor HLA antigens present on vascular endothelium and other graft cells, leading to complement activation and graft injury.\n- A donor is immunologically incompatible if they express any antigen that the recipient has designated as unacceptable; compatibility requires that the donor express none of the unacceptable antigens.\n- Each HLA locus (for example, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR) is diploid; donors carry two alleles per locus.\n- In a large, randomly mating donor population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for each locus, and assuming independence across loci (no linkage disequilibrium between loci for the purpose of this calculation), alleles at a locus are sampled independently according to their population frequencies.\n\nThe candidate’s unacceptable antigen list is:\n- HLA-A: A02 and A24.\n- HLA-B: B07.\n- HLA-DR: DR4 and DR7.\n\nIn the donor population relevant to this candidate’s allocation region, the antigen (allele) frequencies are:\n- HLA-A02 frequency $0.26$, HLA-A24 frequency $0.10$.\n- HLA-B07 frequency $0.09$.\n- HLA-DR4 frequency $0.20$, HLA-DR7 frequency $0.10$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental probabilistic reasoning implied by the facts above, derive an expression for the probability that a random donor from this population would be compatible with the candidate, then use it to compute the cPRA.

It is based on established principles of transplantation immunology and population genetics (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) and provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions required for a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe central task is to compute the calculated Panel Reactive Antibody ($cPRA$), which represents the probability that a randomly selected donor from a given population will be immunologically incompatible with the transplant candidate. A donor is defined as incompatible if they express any of the recipient's listed unacceptable Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). Conversely, a donor is compatible only if they express none of the unacceptable antigens.\n\nThe problem can be solved by first calculating the probability of compatibility, $P(\\text{compatible})$, and then finding its complement, as the $cPRA$ is the probability of incompatibility.\n$$ \\text{cPRA} = P(\\text{incompatible}) = 1 - P(\\text{compatible}) $$\nThe problem states that the HLA loci (A, B, DR) can be considered independent. This allows for the total probability of compatibility to be calculated as the product of the probabilities of compatibility at each individual locus:\n$$ P(\\text{compatible}) = P(\\text{A-locus compatible}) \\times P(\\text{B-locus compatible}) \\times P(\\text{DR-locus compatible}) $$\nWe will now calculate the probability of compatibility for each locus separately. According to the stated principles, a donor is diploid, possessing two alleles at each locus. A donor is compatible at a given locus if and only if **neither** of their two alleles corresponds to an unacceptable antigen for that locus. The alleles are drawn independently from the gene pool according to their population frequencies.\n\nLet $f_{\\text{allele}}$ denote the frequency of a given allele in the population. The probability that a single, randomly drawn allele is **not** a specific unacceptable allele $i$ is $(1 - f_i)$. If a locus has multiple unacceptable alleles (e.g., $i$, $j$), the probability that a single randomly drawn allele is **not** any of them is $(1 - (f_i + f_j))$, assuming alleles are mutually exclusive. For a donor to be compatible at a locus, both of their alleles must be acceptable. Therefore, the probability of compatibility at a locus with a set of unacceptable alleles $U$ is:\n$$ P(\\text{locus compatible}) = \\left(1 - \\sum_{i \\in U} f_i\\right)^2 $$\n\nNow we apply this to the given data.\n\n**1. HLA-A Locus Compatibility**\nThe unacceptable antigens are A02 and A24. The corresponding allele frequencies are $f_{A02} = 0.26$ and $f_{A24} = 0.10$.\nThe total frequency of unacceptable alleles at the HLA-A locus is the sum of the individual frequencies:\n$$ f_{\\text{A,unacceptable}} = f_{A02} + f_{A24} = 0.26 + 0.10 = 0.36 $$\nThe probability that a single allele at this locus is acceptable is $(1 - 0.36) = 0.64$.\nThe probability that a donor is compatible at the HLA-A locus (i.e., both of their A-locus alleles are acceptable) is:\n$$ P(\\text{A-locus compatible}) = (1 - f_{A02} - f_{A24})^2 = (1 - 0.36)^2 = (0.64)^2 = 0.4096 $$\n\n**2. HLA-B Locus Compatibility**\nThe unacceptable antigen is B07, with a frequency of $f_{B07} = 0.09$.\nThe probability that a donor is compatible at the HLA-B locus is:\n$$ P(\\text{B-locus compatible}) = (1 - f_{B07})^2 = (1 - 0.09)^2 = (0.91)^2 = 0.8281 $$\n\n**3. HLA-DR Locus Compatibility**\nThe unacceptable antigens are DR4 and DR7. The corresponding allele frequencies are $f_{DR4} = 0.20$ and $f_{DR7} = 0.10$.\nThe total frequency of unacceptable alleles at the HLA-DR locus is:\n$$ f_{\\text{DR,unacceptable}} = f_{DR4} + f_{DR7} = 0.20 + 0.10 = 0.30 $$\nThe probability that a single allele at this locus is acceptable is $(1 - 0.30) = 0.70$.\nThe probability that a donor is compatible at the HLA-DR locus is:\n$$ P(\\text{DR-locus compatible}) = (1 - f_{DR4} - f_{DR7})^2 = (1 - 0.30)^2 = (0.70)^2 = 0.49 $$\n\n**4. Overall Compatibility and cPRA Calculation**\nThe derived expression for the probability that a random donor is compatible is:\n$$ P(\\text{compatible}) = (1 - f_{A02} - f_{A24})^2 (1 - f_{B07})^2 (1 - f_{DR4} - f_{DR7})^2 $$\nSubstituting the calculated values for each locus:\n$$ P(\\text{compatible}) = 0.4096 \\times 0.8281 \\times 0.49 $$\n$$ P(\\text{compatible}) \\approx 0.16621239 $$\nNow, we can compute the $cPRA$:\n$$ \\text{cPRA} = 1 - P(\\text{compatible}) = 1 - 0.16621239 = 0.83378761 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\text{cPRA} \\approx 0.8338 $$\n\n**5. Clinical Implications**\nA $cPRA$ value of $0.8338$ indicates that the patient is highly sensitized. Approximately $83.4\\%$ of potential donors in the relevant donor pool are predicted to be immunologically incompatible due to the patient's pre-existing anti-HLA antibodies.\n\n*   **Donor Availability:** This high level of sensitization severely restricts the pool of suitable donors, leaving only an estimated $1 - 0.8338 = 0.1662$, or about $16.6\\%$, as potentially compatible. Consequently, the patient is expected to have a significantly prolonged waiting time on the transplant list for a compatible deceased donor kidney. Access to living donors also becomes more challenging. They are often enrolled in kidney paired donation programs to find a compatible match.\n\n*   **Peri-transplant Immunosuppression Strategy:** The patient is at a very high risk for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), which is a major cause of early and late allograft failure. The management strategy must be aggressive:\n    *   **Desensitization:** Pre-transplant protocols may be required to reduce the levels of circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). These therapies can include plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption to physically remove antibodies, combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and/or targeted agents like rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody to deplete B cells) or bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor to target plasma cells).\n    *   **Induction Therapy:** At the time of transplant, a potent induction immunosuppressive agent is mandatory. This typically involves a lymphocyte-depleting agent such as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) rather than a non-depleting IL-2 receptor antagonist.\n    *   **Maintenance and Monitoring:** Post-transplant, the patient will require an aggressive maintenance immunosuppression regimen, usually a triple therapy consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor (e.g., tacrolimus), an anti-proliferative agent (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil), and corticosteroids. Furthermore, vigilant post-transplant monitoring for the development of de novo DSAs and for subclinical AMR through protocol biopsies and serological surveillance is essential to ensure long-term graft survival. The high-risk status persists even if a crossmatch-negative donor is found, due to the potential for an anamnestic (memory) immune response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8338}$$", "id": "4631435"}, {"introduction": "Following transplantation, maintaining a delicate balance of immunosuppression is paramount to preventing allograft rejection while minimizing drug-related toxicities.

The total daily dose, $TDD$, is related to the dose $D$ and interval $\\tau$ by $TDD = D \\cdot (24 \\text{ hours} / \\tau)$.

Substituting this into the equation for $C_{ss,avg}$ yields:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot TDD}{CL \\cdot (24 \\text{ hours})} $$\nThis equation shows that for a given patient, where $F$ and $CL$ are assumed constant, the average steady-state concentration is directly proportional to the total daily dose, $TDD$.\n\nIn linear pharmacokinetics, all concentration measures at steady state (e.g., peak, trough, average) are directly proportional to the dosing rate. Therefore, the trough concentration at steady state, $C_{ss,trough}$, is also directly proportional to the total daily dose, $TDD$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$ C_{ss,trough} = k \\cdot TDD $$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that incorporates the patient's individual pharmacokinetic parameters ($F$, $CL$, volume of distribution $V_d$) and the dosing interval $\\tau$.

All mentioned molecules (CTLA-4-Ig, CD28, CD80/CD86, CD137, CD134, $\\mathrm{CD8}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{CD45RO}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{CCR7}^{-}$), cell types (effector-memory T cells), and concepts (two-signal model, heterologous immunity from CMV) are standard and accurately represented.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem presents a detailed clinical and immunological puzzle and asks for a mechanistic explanation from a set of options.

All descriptions are based on objective, measurable biological parameters.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any invalidating flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or unrealistic. It presents a complex but formalizable scenario that requires application of advanced immunological principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The analysis will proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central question is to explain how acute T cell-mediated rejection occurs despite immunosuppression with belatacept (CTLA-4-Ig), which effectively blocks the canonical CD28:CD80/CD86 costimulatory pathway (Signal $2$).\n\nThe foundation of the analysis rests on the two-signal model and the key differences between naive T cells and memory T cells.\n*   **Naive T Cell Activation:** A primary immune response requires the activation of naive T cells. This process is strictly dependent on two signals delivered by a professional antigen-presenting cell (APC), typically in a secondary lymphoid organ. Signal $1$ is the T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing its specific peptide-MHC complex. Signal $2$ is delivered by costimulatory molecules, with the CD28:CD80/CD86 interaction being paramount. Without Signal $2$, the naive T cell becomes anergic or undergoes apoptosis. Belatacept is designed to prevent this primary activation by blocking Signal $2$. The problem states this blockade is effective in secondary lymphoid tissues, which is further supported by the minimal germinal center activity in lymph nodes, indicating a lack of robust naive T cell priming.\n*   **Memory T Cell Activation:** Memory T cells, having been previously activated, have distinct properties. They have a lower threshold for activation, faster and more potent effector responses, and different trafficking patterns. Critically, their dependence on CD28-mediated costimulation is significantly reduced compared to naive T cells.\n\nLet us analyze the specific details provided:\n1.  **Infiltrating Cell Phenotype:** The rejection is mediated by $\\mathrm{CD8}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{CD45RO}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{CCR7}^{-}$ cells. This is the definitive immunophenotype of effector-memory T cells ($\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{EM}}$). The absence of the lymph node-homing receptor CCR7 indicates these cells preferentially patrol peripheral, non-lymphoid tissues, such as the kidney allograft.\n2.  **Memory T Cell Properties:** The peripheral blood contains a high frequency of donor-reactive $\\mathrm{CD8}^{+}$ memory T cells that have low CD28 expression. This low expression intrinsically renders them less susceptible to immunosuppression targeting the CD28 pathway.\n3.  **Alternative Costimulation:** These cells upregulate alternative costimulatory receptors, namely CD137 (4-1BB) and CD134 (OX40). Ligation of these receptors by their respective ligands (which may be expressed on graft endothelium or infiltrating APCs, especially in an inflammatory context) can provide potent survival and activation signals that compensate for the lack of CD28 costimulation.\n4.  **Cytokine Support:** Memory T cell recall responses can also be supported by pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 and IL-15, which can partially or fully substitute for Signal $2$. The inflammatory milieu of the graft itself can provide these cytokines.\n5.  **Origin of Memory Cells:** The patient has a history of CMV infection. This is a crucial clue pointing towards **heterologous immunity**. Viral infections are known to generate large pools of memory T cells. A subset of these virus-specific memory T cells can cross-react with alloantigens (peptide-MHC complexes) from the donor graft. These pre-existing, cross-reactive cells provide a ready-made army of alloreactive effector cells.\n\n**Synthesis:** The rejection is not caused by the activation of new, naive alloreactive T cells, as this pathway is effectively blocked by belatacept in the lymph nodes. Instead, rejection is driven by a pre-existing population of donor-cross-reactive memory T cells, likely generated during the prior CMV infection. These $\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{EM}}$ cells circulate in the periphery, enter the graft, and encounter alloantigen (Signal $1$). Due to their characteristically low dependence on CD28 and their ability to use alternative costimulatory pathways (CD137, OX40) and/or respond to inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-12, IL-15), they bypass the belatacept blockade and execute their effector functions (e.g., IFN-$\\gamma$ production), leading to graft injury.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Donor-specific memory T cells have reduced dependence on $\\mathrm{CD28}$-mediated costimulation and can be reactivated by antigen in peripheral tissues with support from inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15 and from alternative costimulatory receptors (for example, CD137 and OX40), thereby bypassing CTLA-4-Ig blockade of $\\mathrm{CD80/CD86}$.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the core mechanism. It correctly identifies the role of memory T cells, their reduced CD28 dependence (consistent with low CD28 expression), reactivation in peripheral tissue (consistent with $\\mathrm{CCR7}^{-}$ phenotype), and the role of alternative costimulation (CD137, OX40, which are upregulated) as a bypass mechanism. This aligns perfectly with our derived model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. CTLA-4-Ig increases the strength of Signal $1$ through the TCR by prolonging peptide–MHC dwell time, which preferentially activates memory T cells and precipitates rejection despite costimulation blockade.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. CTLA-4-Ig's mechanism of action involves binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby interfering with Signal $2$. It has no known effect on the TCR/peptide-MHC interaction (Signal $1$) or on peptide-MHC dwell time.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. High-density alloantigen presentation on graft endothelium intrinsically provides Signal $2$ by crosslinking the TCR, so costimulation blockade is irrelevant when antigen abundance is sufficient.**\nThis statement conflates Signal $1$ and Signal $2$. TCR crosslinking, even at high density, constitutes a strong Signal $1$. It does not intrinsically provide Signal $2$, which is a distinct biochemical event mediated by separate receptor-ligand pairs (like CD28:CD80/CD86). While a very strong Signal $1$ can lower the requirement for Signal $2$, it does not substitute for it. The assertion that it \"intrinsically provides Signal $2$\" is a misrepresentation of the two-signal model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Memory T cells are functionally confined to secondary lymphoid organs, so costimulation blockade in lymph nodes is sufficient to prevent their participation in effector responses within the graft.**\nThis statement is factually wrong. While central memory T cells ($\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{CM}}$) are enriched in secondary lymphoid organs, effector memory T cells ($\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{EM}}$) are defined by their ability to circulate in the periphery and home to non-lymphoid tissues (like the allograft), a process mediated by their lack of CCR7. The cells described in the biopsy ($\\mathrm{CCR7}^{-}$) are precisely these peripheral-homing cells. The premise is false, and the conclusion is contradicted by the patient's outcome.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Prior viral infections generate heterologous, cross-reactive alloreactive memory T cells that, owing to epigenetically poised effector loci and reduced $\\mathrm{CD28}$ dependence, can home to the graft and execute effector functions upon antigen encounter despite blockade of $\\mathrm{CD80/CD86}$ in lymphoid tissues.**\nThis statement provides a deeper, more complete explanation that is strongly supported by the problem's givens. It correctly identifies the likely origin of the alloreactive memory cells (heterologous immunity from prior CMV infection). It correctly describes key features of memory cells: epigenetically poised effector loci (explaining the strong and rapid IFN-$\\gamma$ signature), reduced CD28 dependence, and peripheral homing. This mechanism comprehensively accounts for the observed belatacept-resistant rejection. Options A and E are not mutually exclusive; E provides the etiology and additional cellular basis for the general mechanism described in A.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "4631416"}]}
