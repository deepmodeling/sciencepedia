The calculation proceeds in several steps: first, determining the mean blood flow velocity from the Doppler frequency shift; second, calculating the volumetric flow rate; and third, normalizing this flow rate by the graft weight.\n\nThe relationship between the Doppler frequency shift, $\\Delta f$, and the velocity of the reflector (blood), $\\bar{v}$, is given by the Doppler equation:\n$$ \\Delta f = \\frac{2 f_0 \\bar{v} \\cos(\\theta)}{c} $$\nHere, $f_0$ is the transmitted ultrasound frequency, $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium, and $\\theta$ is the insonation angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow.
