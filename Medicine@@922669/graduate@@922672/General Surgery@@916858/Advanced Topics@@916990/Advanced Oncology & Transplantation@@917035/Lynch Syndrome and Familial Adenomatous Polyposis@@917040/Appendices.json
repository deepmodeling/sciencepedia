The diagnostic pathway described (IHC for mismatch repair proteins, MSI testing, and BRAF mutation analysis) is the standard of care for identifying Lynch syndrome in patients with colorectal cancer. The given likelihood ratios are clinically realistic; for instance, the *BRAF* V600E mutation is strongly associated with sporadic MSI-high cancers but is exceptionally rare in Lynch syndrome, justifying the high likelihood ratio.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data—prior probabilities, likelihood ratios for all pieces of evidence, and the crucial assumption of conditional independence—to calculate a unique posterior probability. The objective is clearly stated.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Consistency Check**: The prior probabilities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive: $P(S) + P(L) = 0.97 + 0.03 = 1.00$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a solution.

The relationship between posterior odds, prior odds, and the likelihood ratio is given by:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio} $$\nThe goal is to calculate the posterior probability of the cancer being sporadic, which we denote as $P(S | E)$, where $E$ represents the combined evidence from all three tests, $E = E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3$. The odds are calculated in favor of the 'sporadic' state ($S$) versus the 'Lynch syndrome' state ($L$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior odds in favor of the cancer being sporadic.\n$$ \\text{Prior Odds}(S) = \\frac{P(S)}{P(L)} = \\frac{0.97}{0.03} $$\n\nNext, we determine the total likelihood ratio for the combined evidence $E$. The problem states that the test results are conditionally independent given the true state. This allows us to find the combined likelihood ratio, $LR_{\\text{total}}$, by multiplying the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{P(E|S)}{P(E|L)} = \\frac{P(E_1|S)P(E_2|S)P(E_3|S)}{P(E_1|L)P(E_2|L)P(E_3|L)} $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = \\left(\\frac{P(E_1|S)}{P(E_1|L)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(E_2|S)}{P(E_2|L)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(E_3|S)}{P(E_3|L)}\\right) $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = LR_1 \\times LR_2 \\times LR_3 $$\nSubstituting the given values for the likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = 1.3 \\times 0.2 \\times 50 $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = 1.3 \\times 10 = 13 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the posterior odds in favor of the sporadic state:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E) = \\text{Prior Odds}(S) \\times LR_{\\text{total}} $$\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E) = \\left(\\frac{0.97}{0.03}\\right) \\times 13 $$\nTo maintain precision, we work with fractions:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E) = \\frac{97}{3} \\times 13 = \\frac{1261}{3} $$\n\nThe final step is to convert the posterior odds back into a probability. If the odds in favor of an event $A$ are $O(A)$, the probability of $A$ is given by:\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{O(A)}{1 + O(A)} $$\nApplying this to our posterior odds for the sporadic state:\n$$ P(S | E) = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E)}{1 + \\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E)} $$\n$$ P(S | E) = \\frac{\\frac{1261}{3}}{1 + \\frac{1261}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1261}{3}}{\\frac{3}{3} + \\frac{1261}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1261}{3}}{\\frac{1264}{3}} $$\n$$ P(S | E) = \\frac{1261}{1264} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as requested.\n$$ P(S | E) = \\frac{1261}{1264} \\approx 0.997626582... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.9976$.\nThe result indicates that despite the initial findings suggestive of Lynch syndrome (MSI-high and MLH1/PMS2 loss), the presence of the BRAF V$600$E mutation provides such strong evidence for a sporadic etiology that the posterior probability of the cancer being sporadic is extremely high.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9976}$$", "id": "4639805"}, {"introduction": "Identifying a genetic variant is only the beginning of the diagnostic journey; the critical challenge lies in classifying its clinical significance.
