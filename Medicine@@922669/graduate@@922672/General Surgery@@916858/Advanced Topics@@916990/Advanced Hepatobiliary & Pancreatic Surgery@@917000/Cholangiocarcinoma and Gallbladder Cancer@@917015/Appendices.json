Preoperative biliary drainage normalized serum total bilirubin to $0.9$ mg/dL and international normalized ratio (INR) to $1.0$. The local laboratory upper limits of normal (ULN) are bilirubin $1.2$ mg/dL and INR $1.2$. Postoperative daily laboratory values are as follows (serum total bilirubin in mg/dL, INR unitless):\n\n- Postoperative day (POD) $1$: bilirubin $2.8$, INR $1.5$.\n- POD $2$: bilirubin $3.1$, INR $1.6$.\n- POD $3$: bilirubin $2.9$, INR $1.4$.\n- POD $4$: bilirubin $3.2$, INR $1.3$.\n- POD $5$: bilirubin $3.6$, INR $1.5$.\n- POD $6$: bilirubin $3.8$, INR $1.5$.\n- POD $7$: bilirubin $3.3$, INR $1.4$.\n\nClinical course and management: The patient remains hemodynamically stable on the surgical ward without vasopressors, invasive ventilation, renal replacement therapy, or reoperation.

PHLF is defined as being present if there is an increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and hyperbilirubinemia relative to the upper limits of normal (ULN), on or after postoperative day (POD) $5$.\n\nFirst, we establish the reference values. The local laboratory ULN are given as:\n- Bilirubin ULN: $1.2$ mg/dL\n- INR ULN: $1.2$\n\nNext, we examine the patient's laboratory values on or after POD $5$. The earliest such time point provided is POD $5$.\n- On POD $5$, the serum total bilirubin is $3.6$ mg/dL.\n- On POD $5$, the INR is $1.5$.\n\nWe compare these values to their respective ULNs:\n- For bilirubin: $3.6 \\text{ mg/dL} > 1.2 \\text{ mg/dL}$. The criterion of hyperbilirubinemia is met.\n- For INR: $1.5 > 1.2$. The criterion of an increased INR is met.\n\nSince both the INR and the serum total bilirubin are elevated above their laboratory-specific upper limits of normal on POD $5$, the patient meets the ISGLS core definition for PHLF.\n\n**Step 2: Determination of the ISGLS Grade**\n\nThe problem provides the definitions for the ISGLS grades of PHLF:\n- **Grade A**: Biochemical evidence of PHLF but no change in the patient's clinical management.\n- **Grade B**: PHLF requiring a deviation from the regular postoperative course, limited to noninvasive therapeutic measures. Examples include administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), diuretics, or albumin.\n- **Grade C**: PHLF requiring invasive therapeutic measures such as mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, invasive hemodynamic support, or reoperation for a cause attributable to liver failure.\n\nWe must analyze the patient's clinical course and the management provided. The problem states that the patient's clinical management was altered on POD $6$. Specifically, the patient received \"$2$ units of fresh frozen plasma, initiates intravenous albumin, and adjusts diuretics.\" This represents a clear \"deviation from the regular postoperative course\" and a \"change in clinical management\". Therefore, the patient's condition does not meet the definition of Grade A PHLF.\n\nThe choice is now between Grade B and Grade C. We must determine if the interventions constitute noninvasive (Grade B) or invasive (Grade C) therapy. The interventions were:\n1. Administration of $2$ units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).\n2. Initiation of intravenous albumin.\n3. Adjustment of diuretics.\n\nThe definition of Grade C lists specific examples of invasive support: \"mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, invasive hemodynamic support, or reoperation...\". The problem explicitly states the patient did **not** require any of these, noting the patient was \"without vasopressors, invasive ventilation, renal replacement therapy, or reoperation.\"\n\nThe therapies the patient did receive—FFP, albumin, and diuretics—are considered noninvasive interventions in the context of the ISGLS classification. They\nare intended to correct coagulopathy, manage fluid status, and support oncotic pressure without the need for organ-support devices or major procedures. These interventions precisely match the criteria for Grade B PHLF, which requires therapeutic measures that deviate from the normal clinical pathway but are not invasive.\n\nTherefore, the patient's condition is classified as Grade B PHLF.\n\n**Step 3: Mapping the Grade to a Numerical Value**\n\nThe problem requires a single numerical final answer based on the following mapping:\n- Grade A $\\mapsto 1$\n- Grade B $\\mapsto 2$\n- Grade C $\\mapsto 3$\n\nSince we determined the PHLF grade to be Grade B, the corresponding numerical value is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4607323"}]}
