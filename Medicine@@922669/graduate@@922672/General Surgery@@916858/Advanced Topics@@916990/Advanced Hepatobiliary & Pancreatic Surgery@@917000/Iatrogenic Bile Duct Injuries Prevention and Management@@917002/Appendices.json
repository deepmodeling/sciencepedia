I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the odds ratio ($OR$) for major bile duct injury, comparing operations for acute cholecystitis (the \"exposed\" group) to those for elective cholelithiasis (the \"unexposed\" group).\n\nLet's define the groups and outcomes:\n-   Group A: Acute cholecystitis cohort.\n-   Group E: Elective cholelithiasis cohort.\n-   Event ($D$): A patient experiences a major bile duct injury.\n-   No Event ($H$): A patient does not experience a major bile duct injury.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the number of patients with and without the event in each group.\n\nFor Group A (Acute Cholecystitis):\n-   Total number of operations, $n_A = 2400$.\n-   Injury frequency is $7.5$ per $1000$ operations, which corresponds to a probability of injury, $p_A = \\frac{7.5}{1000} = 0.0075$.\n-   Number of patients with injury (events), $d_A = n_A \\times p_A = 2400 \\times 0.0075 = 18$.\n-   Number of patients without injury (no events), $h_A = n_A - d_A = 2400 - 18 = 2382$.\n\nFor Group E (Elective Cholelithiasis):\n-   Total number of operations, $n_E = 12000$.\n-   Injury frequency is $1.5$ per $1000$ operations, which corresponds to a probability of injury, $p_E = \\frac{1.5}{1000} = 0.0015$.\n-   Number of patients with injury (events), $d_E = n_E \\times p_E = 12000 \\times 0.0015 = 18$.\n-   Number of patients without injury (no events), $h_E = n_E - d_E = 12000 - 18 = 11982$.\n\nThe odds of an event in a group is the ratio of the number of individuals who experience the event to the number of individuals who do not.\n\nThe odds of injury in Group A are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_A = \\frac{d_A}{h_A} = \\frac{18}{2382}\n$$\n\nThe odds of injury in Group E are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_E = \\frac{d_E}{h_E} = \\frac{18}{11982}\n$$\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of the odds in the exposed group (Group A) to the odds in the unexposed group (Group E).\n$$\nOR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_A}{\\text{Odds}_E}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the odds:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{d_A}{h_A}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{d_E}{h_E}\\right)} = \\frac{d_A \\times h_E}{d_E \\times h_A}\n$$\nThis is the standard cross-product ratio from a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Now, we substitute the calculated values:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{18 \\times 11982}{18 \\times 2382}\n$$\nThe term $18$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{11982}{2382}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nOR \\approx 5.030226699...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $0$, $3$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down. The trailing zero is significant and must be retained.\n$$\nOR \\approx 5.030\n$$\nThis means the odds of a major bile duct injury in a patient undergoing cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis are approximately $5.030$ times the odds of the same injury in a patient undergoing an elective procedure for cholelithiasis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.030}$$", "id": "4630986"}, {"introduction": "Intraoperative tools like cholangiography are essential for navigating complex biliary anatomy, but their value is determined by their diagnostic accuracy.

It is scientifically grounded in epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The problem is a formal application of risk modeling relevant to surgical quality improvement.\n\nThe problem asks for two results: first, a general expression for the expected bile duct injury (BDI) incidence as a function of Critical View of Safety (CVS) compliance, and second, the absolute reduction in BDI incidence for a specific increase in compliance.\n\nLet us define the variables and constants based on the problem statement:\n- $r_0$: The baseline incidence of BDI in the absence of CVS.
