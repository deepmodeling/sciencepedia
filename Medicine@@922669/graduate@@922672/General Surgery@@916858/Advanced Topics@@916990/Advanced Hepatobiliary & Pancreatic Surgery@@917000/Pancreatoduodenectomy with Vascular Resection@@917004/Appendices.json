The need for vascular resection and reconstruction is a common clinical scenario. The values for the length of involvement ($25 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and available healthy vein cuffs ($18 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$) are realistic. The surgical principle of a tension-free anastomosis to prevent thrombosis or stenosis is fundamental in vascular surgery. The use of an interposition graft with a specified redundancy factor ($10\\%$) is a standard and logical technique to achieve this. The anatomical constraints mentioned are accurate. The problem is based on sound surgical and anatomical principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The question is specific, asking for a single quantifiable value—the graft length. All necessary data to compute this value are provided. The assumptions listed (e.g., the defect size is equal to the resected lesion length, negligible spatulation effect) serve to remove ambiguity and render the problem well-defined. A unique, stable solution can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. It is free of subjective claims or bias.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem statement is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or missing information. The solution can now be formulated.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the final length of the interposition graft, $L_{graft}$.\n\nThe problem states that a segment of the portal vein is to be resected. This resection creates a defect or gap of a certain length, which the graft must bridge. According to Assumption 1, \"only the involved $25 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ segment is resected.\" Therefore, the length of the defect created, $L_{defect}$, is equal to the length of the resected lesion.\n$$L_{defect} = L_{lesion} = 25 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe information regarding the $18 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of normal proximal and distal vein is crucial for establishing the feasibility of the operation, ensuring that there is sufficient healthy tissue for anastomosis. However, Assumption 2 explicitly states that these segments are \"used to provide healthy anastomotic cuffs and safe clamp positions rather than to reduce the gap.\" This clarifies that the defect length of $25 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is not shortened by mobilizing these adjacent segments.\n\nTo ensure a tension-free anastomosis, a redundancy factor, $R$, of $10\\%$ is to be incorporated into the graft length. This means the graft must be $10\\%$ longer than the defect it spans. The redundancy factor can be expressed as a decimal:\n$$R = 10\\% = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.1$$\nThe required graft length, $L_{graft}$, is the sum of the defect length and the added redundancy length. The redundancy length is the product of the defect length and the redundancy factor.\n$$L_{graft} = L_{defect} + (L_{defect} \\times R)$$\nThis can be factored for a more direct calculation:\n$$L_{graft} = L_{defect} \\times (1 + R)$$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$L_{defect} = 25 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$R = 0.1$$\nWe can now compute the final graft length:\n$$L_{graft} = 25 \\times (1 + 0.1)$$\n$$L_{graft} = 25 \\times 1.1$$\n$$L_{graft} = 27.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe required interposition graft length, including the specified $10\\%$ redundancy, is $27.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

It is defined as the product of the cross-sectional area of flow, $A$, and the average velocity of the fluid, $v$, perpendicular to that area. The problem states that the Doppler-measured mean axial velocity can be taken as the cross-sectionally averaged velocity. The governing equation is:\n$$Q = A \\cdot v$$\nHere, the PV lumen is assumed to be circular. The cross-sectional area $A$ is given by the formula for the area of a circle with diameter $D$:\n$$A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^2$$\nThe problem provides the following givens for the reconstructed PV:\n- Mean axial velocity, $v = 15 \\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$\n- PV lumen diameter, $D = 0.8 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{0.8 \\,\\mathrm{cm}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi (0.4 \\,\\mathrm{cm})^2 = 0.16\\pi \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\nNow, we can compute the reconstructed volumetric flow, $Q_{reconstructed\\_PV}$:\n$$Q_{reconstructed\\_PV} = A \\cdot v = (0.16\\pi \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2) \\cdot (15 \\,\\mathrm{cm/s}) = 2.4\\pi \\,\\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requires the flow to be expressed in $\\mathrm{mL/s}$. Since $1 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^3$ is equivalent to $1 \\,\\mathrm{mL}$, the conversion is direct:\n$$Q_{reconstructed\\_PV} = 2.4\\pi \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\nEvaluating this numerically:\n$$Q_{reconstructed\\_PV} \\approx 2.4 \\times 3.14159265... \\,\\mathrm{mL/s} \\approx 7.5398 \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as specified:\n$$Q_{reconstructed\\_PV} \\approx 7.54 \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Expected PV Volumetric Flow**\n\nTo contextualize this value, we must calculate the expected physiological PV flow for this patient. The givens are:\n- Patient mass, $m_{patient} = 70 \\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Estimated total hepatic blood flow, $q_{total\\_hepatic} = 25 \\,\\mathrm{mL/kg/min}$\n- Portal venous contribution to total hepatic inflow = $0.75$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total hepatic blood flow, $Q_{total\\_hepatic}$, for this specific patient:\n$$Q_{total\\_hepatic} = q_{total\\_hepatic} \\cdot m_{patient} = (25 \\,\\mathrm{mL/kg/min}) \\cdot (70 \\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 1750 \\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$$\nNext, we determine the expected portal venous inflow, $Q_{expected\\_PV}$, which is $0.75$ of the total hepatic flow:\n$$Q_{expected\\_PV} = 0.75 \\cdot Q_{total\\_hepatic} = 0.75 \\cdot (1750 \\,\\mathrm{mL/min}) = 1312.5 \\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$$\nTo compare this with the reconstructed flow, we must convert the units from $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ to $\\mathrm{mL/s}$ by dividing by $60$:\n$$Q_{expected\\_PV} = \\frac{1312.5 \\,\\mathrm{mL}}{1 \\,\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{1 \\,\\mathrm{min}}{60 \\,\\mathrm{s}} = 21.875 \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\n\n**Part 3: Application of the Safety Threshold and Decision**\n\nThe problem defines a safety threshold for surgical revision. Revision is warranted if the reconstructed flow is less than half of the expected flow. This can be expressed as:\n$$\\text{Revision warranted if } Q_{reconstructed\\_PV} < 0.5 \\cdot Q_{expected\\_PV}$$\nLet's compute the threshold value:\n$$0.5 \\cdot Q_{expected\\_PV} = 0.5 \\cdot (21.875 \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}) = 10.9375 \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\nNow, we compare our calculated reconstructed flow to this threshold:\n$$Q_{reconstructed\\_PV} \\approx 7.54 \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\nThe comparison is:\n$$7.54 \\,\\mathrm{mL/s} < 10.9375 \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\nThe inequality is true. The measured flow in the reconstructed portal vein is indeed less than the safety threshold. Therefore, according to the criteria given in the problem, revision is warranted.\n\nThe decision is encoded as $1$ for revision and $0$ for no revision. Since revision is warranted, the decision code is $1$.\n\nThe final answer requires a two-entry row matrix containing the reconstructed PV flow (rounded to three significant figures, without units) and the binary decision.\n- Reconstructed flow: $7.54$\n- Decision: $1$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 7.54 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4653988"}, {"introduction": "The surgeon's responsibility extends well beyond the operating room, with post-operative management being key to long-term success.
