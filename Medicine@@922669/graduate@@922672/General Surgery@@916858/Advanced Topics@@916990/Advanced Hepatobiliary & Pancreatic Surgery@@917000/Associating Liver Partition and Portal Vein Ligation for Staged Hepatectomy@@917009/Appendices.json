This practice focuses on the most fundamental calculation in hepatobiliary surgery: determining the Future Liver Remnant (FLR) fraction.

In volumetric assessment by contrast-enhanced computed tomography, the total liver volume is measured as $1500$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ and the future liver remnant volume is $450$ $\\mathrm{mL}$. In perioperative hepatology, the postoperative functional capacity is modeled to be proportional to the fraction of liver mass remaining. Using the fundamental definition that the future liver remnant fraction $f$ is the ratio of the future liver remnant volume to the total liver volume, determine $f$. Assume this institution requires a minimum $f_{\\min} = 0.30$ for proceeding to Stage 2 in non-cirrhotic livers to reduce the risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure.

The quality of the liver parenchyma is as important as its quantity, and factors like prolonged chemotherapy can significantly impair its function. This exercise builds upon the basic volumetric assessment by introducing a patient with chemotherapy-associated liver injury, requiring a higher FLR threshold for safety. You will practice calculating the *additional* liver volume that must be generated during the first stage of ALPPS to meet this elevated safety standard, a crucial skill for managing high-risk patients [@problem_id:4600855].", "problem": "A hepatobiliary surgery team is planning associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) for a patient with bilobar colorectal liver metastases after prolonged cytotoxic chemotherapy. The patient’s imaging demonstrates a total liver volume (TLV) of $1800$ mL, with a future liver remnant (FLR) volume of $360$ mL. The patient’s liver shows macrovesicular steatosis greater than $30\\%$ on biopsy, and sinusoidal injury is suspected due to chemotherapy exposure. Using only fundamental definitions and well-tested clinical thresholds, proceed as follows:\n- Use the definition of the FLR fraction $f$ as $f = V_{\\mathrm{FLR}}/V_{\\mathrm{TLV}}$.\n- For patients with chemotherapy-associated liver injury and steatosis greater than $30\\%$, adopt the widely accepted minimum safe FLR fraction $f_{\\min} = 0.30$ (normal livers typically require $f_{\\min} \\approx 0.20$, and cirrhosis requires higher thresholds).\n- Assume that, to first approximation for planning purposes, the total liver volume $V_{\\mathrm{TLV}}$ remains unchanged during the calculation of the minimum required FLR volume for safety.\n\nCompute the FLR fraction $f$ for this patient and, based on the safety threshold above, determine the minimum additional FLR volume $\\Delta V$ that must be achieved (for example, via hypertrophy induced by the first stage of ALPPS) for the patient to reach the minimum safe FLR fraction. Provide a single numeric answer equal to $\\Delta V$ in milliliters. Round your answer to three significant figures and express the final result in mL. As part of your reasoning (to be shown in your working, not in the final numeric answer), explain why the computed baseline FLR fraction is inadequate in the setting of chemotherapy and steatosis greater than $30\\%$.", "solution": "The analysis proceeds by first calculating the patient's current future liver remnant (FLR) fraction and then determining the necessary increase in FLR volume to meet the minimum safety threshold for major hepatectomy in the context of chemotherapy-associated liver injury.\n\nThe following parameters are given:\n- Total Liver Volume, $V_{\\mathrm{TLV}} = 1800$ mL.\n- Future Liver Remnant Volume, $V_{\\mathrm{FLR}} = 360$ mL.\n- Minimum safe FLR fraction for this patient, $f_{\\min} = 0.30$.\n\nFirst, we compute the patient's baseline FLR fraction, denoted by $f$, using the provided definition:\n$$f = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{FLR}}}{V_{\\mathrm{TLV}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$f = \\frac{360 \\text{ mL}}{1800 \\text{ mL}} = \\frac{36}{180} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.20$$\nThe patient’s current FLR fraction is $f = 0.20$, or $20\\%$.\n\nNext, we must assess the adequacy of this FLR fraction.

The reason for this inadequacy is that prolonged cytotoxic chemotherapy and significant macrovesicular steatosis ($30\\%$) both impair the functional capacity and regenerative potential of the liver parenchyma. Chemotherapy can induce conditions such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis (CASH), which reduce the effective number of functioning hepatocytes per unit volume of liver tissue. Consequently, a larger volume of liver remnant is required to provide sufficient metabolic, synthetic, and detoxification functions to prevent post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), a major cause of mortality after extensive liver resection. While an FLR fraction of $0.20$ might be acceptable for a patient with a healthy liver, it is insufficient for a liver compromised by chemotherapy and steatosis. The higher threshold of $f_{\\min} = 0.30$ is a well-established clinical standard to ensure patient safety in this high-risk scenario.\n\nTo determine the minimum additional FLR volume, $\\Delta V$, required for the patient to safely undergo the second stage of the hepatectomy, we first calculate the minimum required FLR volume, $V_{\\mathrm{FLR,min}}$. This is based on the minimum safe fraction $f_{\\min}$ and the total liver volume $V_{\\mathrm{TLV}}$, which is assumed to remain constant for this calculation.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{FLR,min}} = f_{\\min} \\times V_{\\mathrm{TLV}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{FLR,min}} = 0.30 \\times 1800 \\text{ mL} = 540 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe minimum target volume for the FLR is $540$ mL.\n\nThe minimum additional volume, $\\Delta V$, that must be induced (e.g., via hypertrophy following the first stage of the ALPPS procedure) is the difference between the minimum required FLR volume and the patient's current FLR volume:\n$$\\Delta V = V_{\\mathrm{FLR,min}} - V_{\\mathrm{FLR}}$$\nSubstituting the volumes:\n$$\\Delta V = 540 \\text{ mL} - 360 \\text{ mL} = 180 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe required increase in FLR volume is exactly $180$ mL.
