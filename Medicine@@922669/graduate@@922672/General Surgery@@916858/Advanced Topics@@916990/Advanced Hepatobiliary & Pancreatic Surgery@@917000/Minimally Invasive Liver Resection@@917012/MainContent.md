## Introduction
Minimally invasive liver resection (MILR) stands at the forefront of modern hepatobiliary surgery, representing a paradigm shift from traditional open procedures. Its adoption promises reduced patient trauma and faster recovery, yet its complexity demands more than just technical dexterity; it requires a profound understanding of hepatic physiology, advanced imaging, and interdisciplinary teamwork. This article addresses the need for a cohesive, principles-based framework for approaching MILR, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and expert clinical application.

Across three comprehensive chapters, you will build a robust foundation for mastering this advanced surgical method. The journey begins with **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** which details the essential criteria for patient selection, the mechanics of hemorrhage control, and the tools of parenchymal transection. Next, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** explores how these principles are synthesized in complex clinical decision-making, emphasizing the crucial role of multidisciplinary teams and advanced technologies. Finally, **"Hands-On Practices"** will challenge you to apply this knowledge to solve realistic clinical problems. This structured approach ensures a deep, practical understanding, starting with the fundamental building blocks of the procedure.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Minimally invasive liver resection (MILR) represents a confluence of advanced surgical technique, sophisticated imaging, and a deep understanding of hepatic physiology. Its successful execution requires a principles-based approach that spans the entire perioperative continuum, from patient selection and operative strategy to meticulous hemostasis and vigilant postoperative care. This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms that form the foundation of modern MILR.

### Patient Selection and Preoperative Planning

The decision to offer a patient MILR is a complex multi-[factorial](@entry_id:266637) assessment. It hinges on a careful balance between achieving the desired oncologic outcome and preserving sufficient liver function to avoid postoperative complications.

#### Anatomical Feasibility and The Surgical Roadmap

The **Couinaud classification** of hepatic anatomy provides the essential roadmap for any liver resection. This system divides the liver into eight functionally independent segments, each supplied by its own portal triad (a branch of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct). The technical feasibility of a minimally invasive approach is heavily influenced by the location of the tumor within this segmental framework.

Lesions situated in the anterior and lateral segments of the liver—specifically segments II, III, IVb, V, and VI—are generally considered more amenable to MILR. These segments are more accessible due to their position, allowing for a more direct approach with laparoscopic or robotic instruments. Conversely, tumors in the posterosuperior segments—segments I (caudate lobe), IVa, VII, and VIII—present a significantly greater technical challenge. Their deep location, proximity to the diaphragm, and intimate relationship with the inferior vena cava (IVC) and major hepatic veins make mobilization and transection more difficult and hazardous.

An ideal candidate for an initial experience with MILR might present with a relatively small tumor ($ 5 \, \mathrm{cm}$) in an anterolateral segment, such as a $3.2 \, \mathrm{cm}$ hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in segment III. If such a lesion is also situated with a clear margin from major vascular structures (e.g., $> 1 \, \mathrm{cm}$ from the left hepatic vein and left portal pedicle), the anatomical risk of the procedure is substantially minimized [@problem_id:4646674].

#### Assessing Functional Reserve: The Future Liver Remnant and Portal Hypertension

Beyond tumor anatomy, the patient's underlying [liver function](@entry_id:163106) is the most critical determinant of safety. The primary goal is to avoid **post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF)**, a devastating complication that occurs when the remaining liver volume is insufficient to support metabolic demands. The volume of the liver that will remain after resection is termed the **future liver remnant (FLR)**. Volumetric analysis of preoperative cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) is essential to calculate the predicted FLR.

The minimum required FLR is dependent on the quality of the liver parenchyma.
- In a patient with a **normal liver**, a predicted FLR of $> 20-25\%$ of the total liver volume is generally considered safe.
- In a patient with underlying liver disease, such as cirrhosis or significant **chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis (CASH)**, a larger remnant is required to compensate for reduced functional capacity per unit volume. For a cirrhotic liver, a minimum FLR of $> 40\%$ is the standard of care [@problem_id:4646674] [@problem_id:4646562].

The presence of **clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH)** dramatically increases the risk of MILR. CSPH is defined by a **hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)** of $\ge 10 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$ or by clinical signs such as splenomegaly, esophageal varices, or thrombocytopenia (platelet count $ 100,000/\mu\mathrm{L}$). Patients with CSPH have an elevated risk of uncontrollable intraoperative bleeding and postoperative hepatic decompensation. Therefore, a patient with well-compensated Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, a MELD score below 10, and an HVPG below the $10 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$ threshold is a much better candidate for resection than a patient with overt signs of portal hypertension [@problem_id:4646674].

#### Absolute versus Relative Contraindications

It is crucial to distinguish between challenges that increase technical difficulty (**relative contraindications**) and conditions that make the procedure prohibitively dangerous (**absolute contraindications**).

**Relative contraindications** are factors that increase the complexity and risk of the operation but may be overcome in highly experienced centers. These include:
- **Obesity:** A high Body Mass Index (BMI) can complicate port placement and visibility.
- **Prior Upper Abdominal Surgery:** Dense adhesions from previous open operations can make laparoscopic access and dissection tedious and hazardous.
- **Difficult Tumor Location:** Tumors in posterosuperior segments (e.g., segment VII) require advanced technical skills.

**Absolute contraindications**, on the other hand, are physiological states that render the patient unable to tolerate the procedure. The foremost of these is severe, decompensated cirrhosis with profound portal hypertension. The pneumoperitoneum required for laparoscopy (typically at intra-abdominal pressures of $10-15 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$) compresses the splanchnic circulation, acutely increasing the already elevated portal pressure. In a patient with refractory ascites and large esophageal varices (e.g., Child-Pugh class B/C, HVPG $> 12 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$), this iatrogenic pressure spike creates an unacceptable risk of catastrophic variceal hemorrhage and irreversible postoperative liver failure. Such a patient is not a candidate for elective MILR, regardless of surgical expertise [@problem_id:4646545].

### Operative Principles and Techniques

Once a patient is deemed a suitable candidate, the intraoperative phase is guided by a series of strategic choices and technical maneuvers designed to achieve an oncologically sound resection while minimizing blood loss and preserving functional parenchyma.

#### Anatomical versus Parenchyma-Sparing Resection

A fundamental strategic decision is the choice between an anatomical and a non-anatomical resection.

**Anatomical resection** (e.g., segmentectomy, sectionectomy) is defined by vascular inflow. The procedure involves isolating the portal pedicle supplying a specific segment (or segments) and removing that entire territory. The transection plane follows the ischemic demarcation line created by inflow occlusion, which naturally occurs along the **venous watershed boundaries** typically marked by major hepatic veins. The rationale is to remove not just the tumor but also its entire associated portal territory, which may harbor microscopic satellite metastases [@problem_id:4646719].

**Non-anatomical resection**, often termed **parenchyma-sparing surgery** (e.g., wedge resection), is defined by the tumor's location rather than vascular anatomy. The goal is to excise the tumor with a sufficient cuff of surrounding normal tissue (an R0 margin) while preserving the maximal amount of functional liver parenchyma. The transection plane is a geometric shape around the tumor and does not respect segmental boundaries, often crossing them [@problem_id:4646719].

The choice between these strategies depends on the tumor biology and the underlying liver health. For tumors like HCC that tend to spread via portal pathways, anatomical resection is often preferred. However, for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), particularly small, peripheral lesions, extensive evidence suggests that once a negative microscopic margin (R0) is achieved, a wider margin provides no additional survival benefit. In such cases, a parenchyma-sparing approach offers comparable oncologic outcomes to anatomical segmentectomy but with superior preservation of postoperative [liver function](@entry_id:163106) due to a larger FLR. This is especially critical in patients with compromised liver parenchyma, for instance from neoadjuvant chemotherapy [@problem_id:4646562].

#### Hemorrhage Control: The Pringle Maneuver and Low CVP Anesthesia

Bleeding is the paramount concern during liver transection. MILR employs a dual strategy of surgical inflow control and anesthetic outflow management.

The **Pringle maneuver** is the temporary occlusion of the entire hepatoduodenal ligament, which contains the portal vein and hepatic artery. This provides total hepatic inflow occlusion, rendering the parenchyma ischemic and dramatically reducing bleeding from arterial and portal venous branches at the transection surface. A key physiological consequence is the abrogation of the **Hepatic Arterial Buffer Response (HABR)**, the mechanism by which the hepatic artery dilates to compensate for reduced portal flow. In a normal liver under normothermia, continuous clamping is generally considered safe for up to 60 minutes. To extend the bloodless field for more complex resections, **intermittent clamping** (e.g., 15 minutes of clamping followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion) is employed, allowing cumulative ischemic times approaching 120 minutes [@problem_id:4646467].

While the Pringle maneuver controls inflow bleeding, back-bleeding from the hepatic veins remains a major challenge. This is managed through **low central venous pressure (LCVP) anesthesia**. Anesthesiologists use a restrictive fluid strategy, minimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and sometimes venodilators to maintain the central venous pressure (CVP), and thus the hepatic venous pressure ($P_{hv}$), at or below $5 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$. The physiological principle is based on transmural pressure ($P_{tm}$) across the cut veins. In a laparoscopic procedure, the external pressure on the liver surface is the intra-abdominal pressure ($P_{IAP}$) from the pneumoperitoneum.

$$P_{tm} \approx P_{hv} - P_{IAP}$$

By keeping $P_{hv}$ low (e.g., $4 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$) and $P_{IAP}$ high (e.g., $12 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$), the transmural pressure becomes negative ($4 - 12 = -8 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$). This [negative pressure](@entry_id:161198) gradient causes the low-pressure hepatic veins and sinusoids to collapse at the transection surface, effectively tamponading venous back-bleeding [@problem_id:4646633].

#### Precision Surgery: Glissonian Approaches and Fluorescence Guidance

For anatomical resections, precise control of segmental inflow is paramount. This can be achieved via two main techniques. The **extrahepatic Glissonian approach** involves dissection at the hepatic hilum, outside the liver parenchyma, to identify and encircle the specific Glissonian pedicle supplying the target segment. In contrast, the **intrahepatic Glissonian approach** involves starting the parenchymal transection guided by intraoperative ultrasound, identifying and controlling the target pedicle from within the liver substance [@problem_id:4646659].

To visualize the transection plane, surgeons increasingly rely on **indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging**. ICG is a dye that, upon intravenous injection, binds to plasma proteins, is taken up exclusively by hepatocytes, and is excreted unchanged into the bile. In a "[negative staining](@entry_id:177219)" technique, the surgeon clamps the target Glissonian pedicle and then administers a bolus of ICG. The laparoscope, switched to a near-infrared (NIR) mode, will show the well-perfused liver fluorescing brightly as it takes up the dye, while the ischemic target segment remains dark. This creates a sharp, real-time demarcation line to guide the transection. The physics of NIR light (excitation $\sim 805 \, \mathrm{nm}$, emission $\sim 835 \, \mathrm{nm}$) allows for several millimeters of tissue penetration, providing a clear superficial guide for the surgeon [@problem_id:4646568].

#### The Tools of Transection

A variety of energy devices are used to divide the liver parenchyma, each with a distinct mechanism and tissue effect.
- **Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA):** Uses low-frequency ultrasound to create cavitation, selectively fragmenting water-rich parenchymal cells while preserving the more fibrous, collagen-rich blood vessels and bile ducts. It provides minimal thermal injury but does not seal vessels, which must be controlled separately.
- **Ultrasonic Shears:** A blade vibrating at $\sim 55 \, \mathrm{kHz}$ generates intense frictional heat, which denatures proteins to create a coagulum and seals small-to-medium vessels (up to $\sim 5 \, \mathrm{mm}$) before mechanically dividing the tissue. The lateral thermal spread is moderate ($1-3 \, \mathrm{mm}$).
- **Bipolar Vessel Sealing Devices:** Use radiofrequency current combined with high pressure to denature and fuse the collagen and elastin in vessel walls, creating a reliable seal for vessels up to $7 \, \mathrm{mm}$ in diameter. Modern devices have feedback-controlled energy delivery, which limits lateral thermal spread to a minimal $1-2 \, \mathrm{mm}$.
- **Vascular Staplers:** Purely mechanical devices that apply rows of titanium staples to compress and occlude larger vascular or Glissonian pedicles before a blade divides the tissue. They provide robust hemostasis with effectively zero thermal injury.

A common strategy is to use the CUSA to dissect through the parenchyma, skeletonizing the vessels and ducts, which are then individually controlled with bipolar sealing devices, clips, or, for larger pedicles, a vascular stapler. This hybrid approach maximizes both precision and safety [@problem_id:4646619].

### Postoperative Complications and Management

Despite meticulous technique, complications can occur. The most feared is post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF).

#### Defining and Grading Post-Hepatectomy Liver Failure (PHLF)

To standardize reporting and management, the **International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS)** established a consensus definition and grading system for PHLF.

PHLF is defined as a "postoperatively acquired deterioration in the ability of the liver to maintain its synthetic, excretory, and detoxifying functions, which are characterized by an **increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and concomitant hyperbilirubinemia on or after postoperative day 5**." A transient rise in these markers before day 5 is common and does not constitute PHLF.

The severity of PHLF is graded based on the clinical intervention required:
- **Grade A:** The patient meets the laboratory definition of PHLF, but it requires no change in standard clinical management.
- **Grade B:** The PHLF necessitates non-invasive management that deviates from the normal course. This includes interventions like the administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or albumin to correct coagulopathy, or [diuretics](@entry_id:155404) to manage ascites.
- **Grade C:** The PHLF is severe and requires invasive therapy, such as renal replacement therapy for hepatorenal syndrome or mechanical ventilation for severe hepatic encephalopathy.

For example, a patient who undergoes a right hepatectomy and on postoperative day 5 has a total bilirubin of $3.8 \, \mathrm{mg/dL}$ and an INR of $1.6$ meets the definition of PHLF. If this coagulopathy requires correction with vitamin K and FFP transfusion, but no other organ support is needed, the patient is classified as having Grade B PHLF [@problem_id:4646499]. This standardized framework is essential for accurately assessing outcomes and comparing results between different centers and techniques.
