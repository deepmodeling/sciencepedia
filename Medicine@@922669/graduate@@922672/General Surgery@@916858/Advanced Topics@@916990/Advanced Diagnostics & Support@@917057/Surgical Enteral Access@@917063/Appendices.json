This type of flow is known as Hagen-Poiseuille flow and is governed by a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nWe begin with the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$. Given the problem statement, we apply the following simplifying conditions:\n1.  **Steady flow**: All time derivatives are zero, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Axisymmetric flow**: All derivatives with respect to the angular coordinate $\\theta$ are zero, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. The tangential velocity component is also zero, $v_{\\theta} = 0$.\n3.  **Fully developed flow**: The velocity profile does not change along the axial direction, $z$. This implies that the axial velocity component $v_z$ is not a function of $z$, so $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n4.  **Incompressibility and continuity**: The continuity equation for an incompressible fluid in cylindrical coordinates is $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r v_r)}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_{\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$. Using the assumptions above, this reduces to $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r v_r)}{\\partial r} = 0$. Integrating this yields $r v_r = \\text{constant}$. At the tube wall ($r=R$), the radial velocity $v_r$ must be zero. This implies the constant is zero, and thus $v_r = 0$ everywhere.\n\nWith these conditions, the velocity vector simplifies to $\\mathbf{v} = (0, 0, v_z(r))$, meaning the fluid flows only in the axial direction and the velocity profile depends only on the radial position.\n\nThe $r$- and $\\theta$-components of the Navier-Stokes equation reduce to $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial r} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, respectively. This indicates that the pressure $P$ is a function of only the axial coordinate, $z$, i.e., $P=P(z)$.\n\nThe $z$-component of the Navier-Stokes equation, which describes the balance of forces in the direction of flow, simplifies dramatically. The inertial terms on the left-hand side are zero, and the equation becomes:\n$$0 = -\\frac{d P}{d z} + \\mu \\left[\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{d r}\\left(r \\frac{d v_z}{d r}\\right)\\right]$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. We can rearrange this to:\n$$\\frac{d}{d r}\\left(r \\frac{d v_z}{d r}\\right) = \\frac{r}{\\mu}\\frac{d P}{d z}$$\nThe left side of this equation is a function of $r$ only, while the term $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ is a function of $z$ only. This can only be true if both are equal to a constant. The pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ is constant along the tube. Given a pressure drop $\\Delta P$ over a length $L$, where $\\Delta P = P(0) - P(L)$, the pressure gradient is constant and equal to $-\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$.\n$$\\frac{d}{d r}\\left(r \\frac{d v_z}{d r}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\mu L} r$$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$r \\frac{d v_z}{d r} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r^2 + C_1$$\n$$\\frac{d v_z}{d r} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r + \\frac{C_1}{r}$$\nFor the velocity gradient (and thus shear stress) to be finite at the centerline of the tube ($r=0$), the constant $C_1$ must be zero.\n$$\\frac{d v_z}{d r} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r$$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$ gives the velocity profile:\n$$v_z(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} r^2 + C_2$$\nWe determine the integration constant $C_2$ using the no-slip boundary condition at the tube wall, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at $r=R$: $v_z(R) = 0$.\n$$0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} R^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P R^2}{4\\mu L}$$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the equation for $v_z(r)$ gives the final parabolic velocity profile:\n$$v_z(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P R^2}{4\\mu L} - \\frac{\\Delta P r^2}{4\\mu L} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L}(R^2 - r^2)$$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is the integral of the velocity profile over the tube's cross-sectional area, $A$. The differential area element is $dA = 2\\pi r dr$.\n$$Q = \\int_A v_z dA = \\int_0^R v_z(r) (2\\pi r) dr$$\n$$Q = \\int_0^R \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L}(R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) dr$$\nWe factor out the constants:\n$$Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\mu L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R$$\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right)$$\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P R^4}{8\\mu L}$$\nThis is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. From this result, with $\\Delta P$, $\\mu$, and $L$ held constant, the dependence of the volumetric flow rate on the radius is $Q \\propto R^4$.\n\nThe problem states that the radius is increased to $1.20$ times its original value.

This clinical scenario requires you to develop a stepwise declogging protocol, moving from the least to most invasive options.

The bedside nurse reports resistance to flushing and inability to deliver medications. There is no peritubal leakage and abdominal examination is benign. The PEJ is labeled $10$ French (Fr). The nurse has $10$ mL and $60$ mL syringes available, warm sterile water, an institution-approved pancreatic enzyme solution (pancrelipase mixed with sodium bicarbonate), and access to a manufacturer-approved mechanical declogging device designed for enteral feeding tubes. No radiologic or endoscopic exchange is immediately available, but can be arranged within $24$ hours.\n\nFoundational facts for surgical decision-making include: smaller-lumen tubes are more prone to occlusion, warm water can soften and mobilize viscous residues, pancreatic enzymes (lipase, protease, amylase) in an alkaline medium can digest clog components, and mechanical devices specifically designed for enteral tubes can safely disrupt occlusions when used per instructions. Regarding pressure safety, remember that for a given hand-applied force, the pressure transmitted by a syringe plunger is inversely related to the plunger’s cross-sectional area. Typical inner barrel diameters are approximately $14.5$ mm for a $10$ mL syringe and $27$ mm for a $60$ mL syringe.\n\nWhich option represents the most appropriate stepwise declogging protocol that minimizes wall stress on a small-bore jejunostomy while maximizing the likelihood of restoring patency, before considering tube exchange?\n\nA. Generate high shear by forcefully pulsing flushes through the tube using a $10$ mL syringe; if resistance persists, pass a standard guidewire through the lumen to bore through the occlusion; if still unsuccessful, proceed directly to tube exchange.\n\nB. Attempt gentle push–pull flushes of warm sterile water ($30$–$50$ mL) using a $60$ mL syringe, allow a short dwell ($5$–$10$ minutes); if persistent, instill an alkaline pancrelipase solution and allow an adequate dwell (approximately $30$ minutes); if still occluded, use a manufacturer-approved mechanical declogging device per instructions; only if unsuccessful, arrange tube exchange.\n\nC. Instill an acidic beverage (e.g., cola or cranberry juice) to chemically dissolve the clog; if unsuccessful, apply wall suction to generate negative pressure and avoid enzyme solutions to reduce the risk of pancreatitis; then consider exchange.\n\nD.

Flush vigorously with normal saline using a $20$ mL syringe, then aspirate forcefully to produce cavitation; if still clogged, pass an angiographic guidewire to restore lumen patency and defer enzyme therapy to avoid tube degradation.", "solution": "Begin from first principles relevant to surgical enteral access and device safety.\n\nDefine the access and physical constraints. A Percutaneous Endoscopic Jejunostomy (PEJ) is a small-bore feeding tube terminating in the jejunum. French size relates to outer diameter by the definition 1 French (Fr) = 0.33 mm, so a $10$ Fr tube has an outer diameter of approximately $3.3$ mm. The inner diameter is smaller due to wall thickness, reinforcing that jejunal tubes have narrow lumens prone to occlusion by viscous enteral formulas and medication residues.\n\nHydrodynamics and tube patency. For flow through a cylindrical tube under laminar conditions, Poiseuille’s law gives $Q \\propto r^4$ (where $Q$ is volumetric flow and $r$ is inner radius), so small changes in radius dramatically influence flow. In a nearly occluded small-bore tube, gentle flushing with a less viscous fluid can help restore a minimal radius, after which flow increases markedly. Warm water decreases viscosity of lipid-containing residues and can soften proteinaceous clogs, making it an appropriate first-line approach.\n\nPressure safety. Pascal’s principle and basic mechanics give $P = F/A$ for pressure $P$ due to an applied force $F$ over plunger cross-sectional area $A$. For a $10$ mL syringe with inner diameter approximately $14.5$ mm, the plunger cross-sectional area is $A_{10} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{14.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2}\\right)^2 \\approx \\pi \\cdot (7.25\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 \\approx \\pi \\cdot 52.56\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\approx 165\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$. For a $60$ mL syringe with inner diameter approximately $27$ mm, $A_{60} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{27\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2}\\right)^2 \\approx \\pi \\cdot (13.5\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 \\approx \\pi \\cdot 182.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\approx 572\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$. Thus, for the same hand-applied force $F$, the pressure transmitted with a $60$ mL syringe is roughly a factor of $A_{10}/A_{60} \\approx 165/572 \\approx 0.29$ of that with a $10$ mL syringe, meaning the $60$ mL syringe reduces pressure by approximately $3.5$-fold. Lower pressure reduces the risk of tube wall injury or rupture in a small-bore PEJ.\n\nBiochemistry of enzyme declogging. Pancreatic enzymes (pancrelipase contains lipase, protease, and amylase) digest lipid, protein, and carbohydrate components of clogs. Sodium bicarbonate provides an alkaline environment that facilitates enzyme activity and can help solubilize certain medications. An adequate dwell time (on the order of $30$ minutes) permits enzymatic digestion of the occluding material. This step follows warm water flushing and precedes mechanical disruption.\n\nMechanical declogging. After warm water and enzymatic steps, purpose-built mechanical declogging devices (e.g., vibrating or brush systems designed and approved for enteral tubes) can safely disrupt residual clogs when used per manufacturer instructions, even in small-bore jejunal tubes. Improvised devices (e.g., guidewires) carry risks of perforation, tube damage, or migration and are not recommended.\n\nEscalation to exchange. If noninvasive and minimally invasive measures fail, tube exchange via radiologic or endoscopic methods is appropriate. This preserves patient safety by avoiding excessive pressure or traumatic manipulation.\n\nApply these principles to each option:\n\nA. This proposes high shear pulses with a $10$ mL syringe. From $P=F/A$, the $10$ mL syringe produces higher pressure for the same force than a $60$ mL syringe, increasing wall stress and risk of rupture in a $10$ Fr PEJ. Passing a standard guidewire to bore through the occlusion is not a purpose-built declogging method for enteral tubes and risks tube perforation, intraluminal injury, and malposition. Skipping warm water dwell and enzyme digestion violates the least invasive–to–more invasive progression. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. This sequence uses warm sterile water in $30$–$50$ mL aliquots via a $60$ mL syringe with gentle push–pull and a short dwell ($5$–$10$ minutes) to soften and mobilize clogs, minimizing pressure ($P=F/A$) by selecting the larger syringe. Next, an alkaline pancrelipase solution with an adequate dwell (approximately $30$ minutes) employs biochemical digestion of residual clog material. If occlusion persists, use a manufacturer-approved mechanical declogging device per instructions. Only after failure of these steps is tube exchange planned. This is consistent with principles of hydrodynamics, device safety, and enzymatic therapy, and follows an appropriate stepwise escalation. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. Acidic beverages such as cola or cranberry juice are not recommended; they can precipitate some medications, damage tube materials, and are unsupported by evidence for declogging. Applying wall suction introduces negative pressure without control of peak stresses and may cause mucosal trauma or tube collapse. Avoiding enzyme solutions to “reduce pancreatitis risk” misunderstands local intraluminal use; pancrelipase is used intraluminally in the tube and does not cause pancreatitis in this context. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Immediate scheduling of exchange without attempting bedside declogging ignores less invasive, evidence-supported measures that often succeed and does not minimize procedural risk or resource use. While infection risk is always a consideration, warm water flushes, enzyme dwell, and approved mechanical declogging are safe when performed properly. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Vigorously flushing with a $20$ mL syringe increases pressure relative to a $60$ mL syringe (by the same $P=F/A$ principle), and forceful aspiration to produce “cavitation” is uncontrolled and potentially injurious. Passing an angiographic guidewire is not an approved declogging method for enteral tubes and risks perforation and tube damage. Deferring enzyme therapy removes a key, safe step that targets the biochemistry of the clog. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate stepwise declogging protocol is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4671717"}]}
