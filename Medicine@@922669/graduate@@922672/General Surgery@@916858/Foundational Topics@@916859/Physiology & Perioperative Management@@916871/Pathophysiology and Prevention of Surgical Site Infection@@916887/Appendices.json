From first principles, SSI risk is driven by the interaction between microbial inoculum and virulence, local tissue perfusion and injury, host defenses, and the presence of foreign material. The team considers the following three procedures: an elective open Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair with mesh in a non-infected field, an elective sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis for non-perforated diverticulosis, and an emergency appendectomy for a perforated, purulent appendicitis with generalized peritonitis. Using the CDC wound class definitions as the foundational framework and reasoning from the pathophysiology of contamination and infection, choose the option that correctly assigns each procedure to its wound class and ranks the expected SSI risks from lowest to highest across the three procedures.\n\nOptions:\nA. Elective inguinal hernia repair: clean; Elective sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis: clean-contaminated; Emergency perforated appendectomy: dirty-infected; SSI risk order (lowest to highest): hernia repair < sigmoid resection < perforated appendectomy.\n\nB.

A clean-contaminated wound involves controlled entry into the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts without unusual contamination. A contaminated wound includes open, fresh accidental wounds, major breaks in sterile technique, gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract, or incisions encountering acute, nonpurulent inflammation. A dirty-infected wound involves old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and those with existing clinical infection or perforated viscera at the time of surgery.\n- Pathophysiology of surgical site infection (SSI): Infection probability increases as the microbial inoculum increases and host defenses are impaired. A widely accepted experimental observation is that, in the absence of a foreign body, approximately $10^{5}$ colony-forming units per gram of tissue can overcome local host defenses; the presence of foreign material can reduce this threshold to approximately $10^{3}$. Entry into the colon introduces high-density endogenous flora (aerobes and anaerobes), while perforation with pus indicates established infection and higher inocula, along with inflammatory tissue injury, all of which elevate risk.\n\nApply definitions to each procedure:\n- Elective open Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair with mesh in a non-infected field: The alimentary, respiratory, genital, and urinary tracts are not entered, and there is no active infection or inflammation at the site. This is a clean operation. The presence of mesh is a foreign body, which increases susceptibility if contamination occurs, but it does not change the wound class from clean. Typical SSI risk remains at the lower end among general surgery procedures, often reported near $1$–$4\\%$ in the absence of additional risk factors, acknowledging variability by patient and procedural factors.\n- Elective sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis for non-perforated disease: This entails a controlled entry into the alimentary tract without gross spillage or established infection. By definition, this is clean-contaminated. The endogenous microbial burden of the colon increases risk relative to clean wounds; typical SSI risk is higher than clean cases, often in the range of roughly $5$–$10\\%$ depending on technique, prophylaxis, and patient risk.\n- Emergency appendectomy for perforated, purulent appendicitis with generalized peritonitis: Perforated viscus with pus is an existing clinical infection. This is dirty-infected. The inoculum is high, tissues are inflamed and edematous, and host defenses are compromised locally; SSI risk is the highest of the three, frequently exceeding that of contaminated and clean-contaminated wounds.\n\nRank expected SSI risks from lowest to highest:\n- Clean elective hernia repair < clean-contaminated elective sigmoid colectomy < dirty-infected perforated appendectomy.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: Assigns hernia repair as clean, elective sigmoid resection as clean-contaminated, and perforated appendectomy as dirty-infected. The SSI risk order is hernia repair < sigmoid resection < perforated appendectomy. This matches CDC definitions and the pathophysiologic risk gradient tied to inoculum and established infection. Correct.\n- Option B: Correctly labels hernia repair as clean and perforated appendectomy as dirty-infected but misclassifies an elective sigmoid resection without gross spillage as contaminated rather than clean-contaminated. It also misorders risk by placing perforated appendectomy below sigmoid resection, contradicting the higher inoculum and active infection in perforation. Incorrect.\n- Option C: Misclassifies hernia repair as clean-contaminated due to mesh, which is incorrect; mesh does not make a wound clean-contaminated. It also mislabels elective sigmoid resection as contaminated (should be clean-contaminated in routine elective cases), and while it places perforated appendectomy as highest, it incorrectly places sigmoid resection below hernia repair in SSI risk. Incorrect.\n- Option D: Correctly classifies hernia repair and sigmoid resection but misclassifies perforated appendectomy as contaminated instead of dirty-infected, and misorders risk by placing perforated appendectomy below sigmoid resection.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes first-order elimination kinetics, where the drug concentration $C(t)$ at time $t$ decreases exponentially from an initial concentration $C_0$. The core definition of this process is given by the differential equation $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k_e C$, where $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The solution to this equation is:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the concentration to fall to one-half of its initial value. We can use this definition to relate $t_{1/2}$ to $k_e$:\n$$C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{C_0}{2} = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})$$\nDividing by $C_0$ and taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_e t_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2}$$\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nAn alternative and equivalent formulation, based directly on the definition of half-life, states that after a time $t$, the number of half-lives that have elapsed is $n = \\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}$. The concentration is then given by:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = C_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/t_{1/2}}$$\nWe need to find the duration, which we will call $t_{\\text{duration}}$, for which the concentration $C(t)$ remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
