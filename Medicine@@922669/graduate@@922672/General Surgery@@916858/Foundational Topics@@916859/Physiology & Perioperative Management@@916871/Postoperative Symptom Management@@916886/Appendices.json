You plan to transition the patient to oral oxycodone for discharge planning.

Assume linear dose–response within the clinical range, no cross-tolerance reduction is applied, and no organ dysfunction alters pharmacokinetics.

The foundational base is the definition of equianalgesia: for two opioids, doses that produce the same analgesic effect satisfy a proportionality between dose and per-milligram analgesic potency. Let the analgesic effect be represented as an arbitrary effect unit $E$, and let the per-milligram potency of a drug relative to a reference be $p$. Then for a dose $d$, the effect is modeled as $E = d \\times p$ within the linear therapeutic range.\n\nWe adopt oral morphine as the reference with unit potency $p_{\\text{M,oral}} = 1$. The provided potency ratios are interpreted as follows:\n- IV morphine to oral morphine potency $1:3$ means $1$ mg IV morphine is equianalgesic to $3$ mg oral morphine; thus the per-milligram potency of IV morphine relative to oral morphine is $p_{\\text{M,IV}} = 3$.\n- Oral oxycodone to oral morphine potency $1.5:1$ means $1$ mg oral oxycodone is equianalgesic to $1.5$ mg oral morphine; thus the per-milligram potency of oral oxycodone relative to oral morphine is $p_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} = 1.5$.\n\nLet $d_{\\text{M,IV}}$ be the administered $24$-hour IV morphine dose and $d_{\\text{Oxy,oral}}$ be the unknown equianalgesic $24$-hour oral oxycodone dose. Equianalgesia requires\n$$\nd_{\\text{M,IV}} \\times p_{\\text{M,IV}} = d_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} \\times p_{\\text{Oxy,oral}}.\n$$\nSolving for the unknown,\n$$\nd_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} = d_{\\text{M,IV}} \\times \\frac{p_{\\text{M,IV}}}{p_{\\text{Oxy,oral}}}.\n$$\nSubstitute the known values $d_{\\text{M,IV}} = 12$, $p_{\\text{M,IV}} = 3$, and $p_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} = 1.5$:\n$$\nd_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} = 12 \\times \\frac{3}{1.5} = 12 \\times 2 = 24.\n$$\nThus, the equianalgesic total $24$-hour oral oxycodone dose is $24$ mg.
