We begin with the provided definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$:\n$$K_{a}=\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$$\nTo introduce $pK_{a}$ and $pH$, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$ and $\\log(a/b) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)$, we can separate the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right) + \\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]) $$\nNow, we multiply the entire equation by $-1$:\n$$-\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right) - \\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]) $$\nBy definition, $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$ and $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$. Substituting these definitions into the equation yields:\n$$pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right) + pH$$\nTo match the conventional form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we rearrange the terms to solve for $pH$:\n$$pH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right)$$\nThis is the required relationship.\n\nThe second task is to derive an expression for the unionized fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{unionized}}$, in terms of $pH$ and $pK_{a}$. We start from the relationship just derived and solve for the ratio $\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right) = pH - pK_{a}$$\nExponentiating both sides with base $10$ gives:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]} = 10^{(pH - pK_{a})}$$\nThe unionized fraction is defined as:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}}=\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]+[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$$\nTo express this solely in terms of the ratio $\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}} = \\frac{\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}} = \\frac{\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]} + 1}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio we found earlier:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}} = \\frac{10^{(pH - pK_{a})}}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_{a})}}$$\nAn equivalent and often more convenient form can be obtained by dividing the numerator and denominator by $[\\mathrm{B}]$ instead of $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}}=\\frac{\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}+\\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}}$$\nSince $\\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]} = \\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(10^{(pH - pK_{a})}\\right)^{-1} = 10^{-(pH - pK_{a})} = 10^{(pK_{a} - pH)}$, we have:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pK_{a} - pH)}}$$\nThis final expression relates the unionized fraction to $pH$ and $pK_{a}$.\n\nThe third task is to compute the numerical value of $f_{\\mathrm{unionized}}$ for lidocaine with $pK_{a}=7.9$ in tissue with $pH=7.4$. Using the derived formula:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pK_{a} - pH)}}$$\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(7.9 - 7.4)}}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.5}}$$\nThe value of $10^{0.5}$ is $\\sqrt{10}$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sqrt{10}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 3.16227766} \\approx \\frac{1}{4.16227766}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{unionized}} \\approx 0.240253...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
