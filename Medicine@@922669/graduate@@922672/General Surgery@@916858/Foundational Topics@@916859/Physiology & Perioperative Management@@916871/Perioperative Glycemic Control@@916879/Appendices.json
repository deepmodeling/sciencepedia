All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the scenario is consistent with established principles of clinical pharmacology and perioperative medicine. The solution will proceed in two parts, as requested.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of the Correction Insulin Dose\n\nThe correction insulin dose is calculated to lower the patient's blood glucose ($BG$) from its current level to a target level. This calculation is based on the Insulin Sensitivity Factor ($ISF$), which is defined as the expected drop in blood glucose (in mg/dL) per unit of rapid-acting insulin administered.\n\nThe givens for this calculation are:\n- Current blood glucose, $BG_{current} = 240$ mg/dL\n- Target blood glucose, $BG_{target} = 140$ mg/dL\n- Insulin Sensitivity Factor, $ISF = 50$ mg/dL per unit (U)\n\nFirst, we determine the total required reduction in blood glucose, which we denote as $\\Delta BG$.\n$$\n\\Delta BG = BG_{current} - BG_{target}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta BG = 240 \\text{ mg/dL} - 140 \\text{ mg/dL} = 100 \\text{ mg/dL}\n$$\nThe required insulin dose, which we denote as $D_{insulin}$, is the total required glucose reduction divided by the insulin sensitivity factor. This follows directly from the definition of the $ISF$.\n$$\nD_{insulin} = \\frac{\\Delta BG}{ISF}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated $\\Delta BG$ and the given $ISF$:\n$$\nD_{insulin} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mg/dL}}{50 \\text{ mg/dL/U}} = 2 \\text{ U}\n$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated dose of $2$ units is therefore expressed as $2.00$ U.\n\nPart 2: Determination of the Initial Repeat-Check Interval\n\nThe problem asks for the earliest appropriate initial repeat-check interval that balances safety and timeliness by aligning it with the expected peak pharmacodynamic effect of the rapid-acting insulin.\n\nThe provided pharmacodynamic characteristics for the rapid-acting insulin analog are:\n- Onset of action: approximately $10$ minutes\n- Time to peak effect: approximately $60$ minutes\n- Clinically relevant duration: approximately $240$ minutes\n\nThe rationale for timing the repeat BG check is critical. Checking too early (e.g., at $30$ minutes) would be premature, as the insulin's effect would not have fully manifested, providing an incomplete picture of the response. Checking too late (e.g., after several hours) increases the risk of the patient's BG reaching its nadir (lowest point) unobserved, which could lead to severe, unrecognized hypoglycemia. The time of peak effect represents the point of maximum glucose-lowering activity. Therefore, assessing the BG level at or near the time of peak effect is the standard clinical practice. This timing provides the most informative data point regarding the dose's efficacy and the immediate risk of hypoglycemia.\n\nThe problem states that the peak effect occurs at approximately $60$ minutes. Aligning the reassessment with this time point directly addresses the stated goal of balancing safety and timeliness.\n\nTherefore, the proposed earliest appropriate initial repeat-check interval is $60$ minutes.\n\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures. The interval of $60$ minutes is therefore expressed as $60.0$ minutes.\n\nSummary of Results:\n1.  Correction insulin dose: $2.00$ U\n2.  Repeat-check interval: $60.0$ minutes\n\nThe final answer should be presented as a row matrix containing these two numerical values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.00  60.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4656903"}, {"introduction": "Beyond reactive corrections, proactive glycemic management requires accounting for nutritional intake, a common challenge in postoperative care.
