Arterial blood gas is unremarkable.

Assume plasma density is approximately $1$ kilogram per liter and that diffusion of urea across cell membranes is rapid relative to the timescale of clinical fluid shifts.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition that osmolality is the total number of osmotically active particles per kilogram of water and that tonicity (effective osmolality) includes only solutes that do not freely cross cell membranes to generate sustained transcellular osmotic gradients, derive the calculated plasma osmolality and the effective plasma tonicity for this patient using only the major contributors present.

Subsequently, the patient's hyponatremia is to be classified based on the calculated effective tonicity.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principles. Plasma osmolality is defined as the total concentration of all osmotically active solute particles per kilogram of solvent (plasma water). It is expressed in milliosmoles per kilogram of water ($\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$). Effective plasma tonicity, or simply tonicity, is the concentration of only those solutes that are \"impermeant\" or \"ineffective\" at crossing cell membranes, thereby creating a sustained osmotic gradient that governs water movement between the intracellular and extracellular compartments.\n\nThe major contributors to plasma osmolality in this patient are sodium salts, glucose, and urea. The problem provides concentrations in units per volume of plasma (e.g., $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$, $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$). The given assumption that plasma density is approximately $1$ kilogram per liter ($\\mathrm{kg/L}$) allows for the approximation that a concentration per liter of plasma is numerically equivalent to a concentration per kilogram of plasma water. This common clinical simplification will be used, thus measurements in $\\mathrm{mOsm/L}$ will be treated as equivalent to $\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.\n\nWe will now calculate the contribution of each major solute from the provided data.\n\n1.  **Contribution from Sodium ($Na^+$) and its associated anions:**\n    The plasma sodium concentration is given as $[Na^+] = 122 \\mathrm{mEq/L}$. Since sodium is a monovalent cation ($Na^+$), its molar concentration is $122 \\mathrm{mmol/L}$. To maintain electrical neutrality in the extracellular fluid, each sodium cation is balanced by an anion, primarily chloride ($Cl^-$) and bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$). Therefore, for the purpose of calculating osmolality, it is standard to assume that the total osmotic contribution from sodium salts is approximately twice the sodium concentration.\n    Osmotic contribution from sodium salts $= 2 \\times [Na^+] = 2 \\times 122 \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 244 \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$.\n\n2.  **Contribution from Glucose:**\n    The serum glucose concentration is given as $540 \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. We must convert this mass concentration to a molar concentration.\n    First, convert the units to milligrams per liter:\n    $[Glucose]_{mass} = 540 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\times \\frac{10 \\mathrm{dL}}{1 \\mathrm{L}} = 5400 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n    The molecular formula for glucose is $C_6H_{12}O_6$. The molecular weight ($MW_{glucose}$) is calculated using the atomic weights of Carbon ($C \\approx 12.011 \\mathrm{g/mol}$), Hydrogen ($H \\approx 1.008 \\mathrm{g/mol}$), and Oxygen ($O \\approx 15.999 \\mathrm{g/mol}$):\n    $MW_{glucose} = 6 \\times 12.011 + 12 \\times 1.008 + 6 \\times 15.999 = 180.156 \\mathrm{g/mol}$.\n    We will use the value $180.16 \\mathrm{g/mol}$, which is equivalent to $180.16 \\mathrm{mg/mmol}$.\n    The molar concentration of glucose is:\n    $[Glucose]_{molar} = \\frac{5400 \\mathrm{mg/L}}{180.16 \\mathrm{mg/mmol}} \\approx 29.973 \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n    Since glucose does not dissociate in solution, its osmolar contribution is equal to its molar concentration: $29.973 \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$.\n\n3.  **Contribution from Urea:**\n    The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is given as $14 \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This represents the mass of nitrogen contained within urea molecules per deciliter of blood.\n    First, convert the units to milligrams per liter:\n    $[BUN] = 14 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\times \\frac{10 \\mathrm{dL}}{1 \\mathrm{L}} = 140 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n    The chemical formula for urea is $CH_4N_2O$. Each molecule contains two nitrogen atoms. The atomic weight of nitrogen ($N$) is approximately $14.007 \\mathrm{g/mol}$. The molar concentration of nitrogen atoms is:\n    $[N]_{molar} = \\frac{140 \\mathrm{mg/L}}{14.007 \\mathrm{mg/mmol}} \\approx 9.995 \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n    Since each molecule of urea contains two nitrogen atoms, the molar concentration of urea is half the molar concentration of nitrogen atoms:\n    $[Urea]_{molar} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times [N]_{molar} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.995 \\mathrm{mmol/L} \\approx 4.998 \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n    Urea does not dissociate, so its osmolar contribution is equal to its molar concentration: $4.998 \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$.\n\n**Calculation of Total Plasma Osmolality ($P_{osm}$):**\nThe total calculated plasma osmolality is the sum of the contributions from all major solutes:\n$P_{osm} = (\\text{contribution from } Na^+\\text{ salts}) + (\\text{contribution from glucose}) + (\\text{contribution from urea})$\n$P_{osm} \\approx 244 \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 29.973 \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 4.998 \\mathrm{mOsm/L} = 278.971 \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$.\nUsing the problem's assumption, this is approximately $278.971 \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.\n\n**Calculation of Effective Plasma Tonicity:**\nTonicity is determined by solutes that do not freely cross cell membranes.\n-   Sodium is effectively restricted to the extracellular space by the $Na^+/K^+$-ATPase pump and is an effective osmole.\n-   Glucose transport into cells is limited, especially in a state of severe hyperglycemia, so it acts as an effective osmole.\n-   Urea, as stated in the problem, diffuses rapidly across cell membranes. It therefore equilibrates between the intracellular and extracellular fluids and does not contribute to a sustained osmotic gradient. Urea is an *ineffective* osmole.\n\nThe effective plasma tonicity is the sum of the concentrations of the effective osmoles:\nTonicity $= (\\text{contribution from } Na^+\\text{ salts}) + (\\text{contribution from glucose})$\nTonicity $\\approx 244 \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 29.973 \\mathrm{mOsm/L} = 273.973 \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$.\nThis corresponds to an effective plasma tonicity of approximately $273.973 \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.\n\n**Classification of Hyponatremia:**\nThe patient's plasma sodium is $122 \\mathrm{mEq/L}$, which is below the typical normal range of $135$ to $145 \\mathrm{mEq/L}$, hence the patient has hyponatremia. The classification of hyponatremia depends on the effective plasma tonicity. The normal physiological range for tonicity is approximately $275$ to $295 \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.\nOur calculated effective tonicity is $273.973 \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$. Since this value is below the lower limit of the normal range ($273.973  275$), the patient's condition is classified as **hypotonic hyponatremia**. This indicates an excess of water relative to effective solutes in the extracellular fluid, despite the dilutional effect of the hyperglycemia.\n\nThe derived calculated plasma osmolality is approximately $279.0 \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$, and the effective plasma tonicity is approximately $274.0 \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$. The hyponatremia is hypotonic. The problem asks for the effective plasma tonicity rounded to four significant figures as the final answer.\nRounding $273.973 \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$ to four significant figures gives $274.0 \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{274.0}\n$$", "id": "4641150"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of hypernatremia requires more than just calculating a deficit; it demands a safe, therapeutic plan.

Ionized calcium ($Ca^{2+}$), which is the physiologically active form, constituting approximately $50\\%$ of the total calcium.\n$2$. Protein-bound calcium, primarily bound to albumin, accounting for about $40\\%$ of the total.\n$3$. Complexed calcium, which is chelated with anions such as phosphate, citrate, and bicarbonate, making up the remaining $10\\%$.\n\nTotal serum calcium measurement quantifies all three forms, whereas an ionized calcium measurement quantifies only the free, biologically active $Ca^{2+}$ fraction. The patient's total calcium is $7.6\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$, which is below the typical normal range (approximately $8.5$ to $10.5\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$), suggesting hypocalcemia. However, this patient also has significant hypoalbuminemia, with a serum albumin of $2.0\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$ (normal range is typically $3.5$ to $5.5\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$). Since a large fraction of calcium is bound to albumin, a low albumin level will decrease the total calcium concentration without necessarily affecting the physiologically active ionized calcium level.\n\nTo account for this, clinicians often use a correction formula. A common formula is:\n$$ \\text{Corrected Calcium (mg/dL)} = \\text{Measured Total Calcium (mg/dL)} + 0.8 \\times (4.0 - \\text{Serum Albumin (g/dL)}) $$\nApplying this formula to the patient's data:\n$$ \\text{Corrected Calcium} = 7.6 + 0.8 \\times (4.0 - 2.0) = 7.6 + 0.8 \\times 2.0 = 7.6 + 1.6 = 9.2\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} $$\nThis corrected value of $9.2\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ falls within the normal range for total calcium. However, the patient is exhibiting clear clinical signs of hypocalcemia (paresthesias, carpopedal spasm), indicating that the corrected total calcium formula is misrepresenting the true physiological state. This discrepancy arises because the formula does not account for the patient's acid-base status.\n\nThe binding of calcium to albumin is pH-dependent. Albumin has negatively charged sites that can bind either hydrogen ions ($H^+$) or calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). In a state of alkalosis (higher pH, lower $H^+$ concentration), there are fewer $H^+$ ions competing for these binding sites. This increases the binding of $Ca^{2+}$ to albumin, thereby decreasing the concentration of free, ionized calcium. Conversely, in acidosis (lower pH, higher $H^+$ concentration), $H^+$ ions displace $Ca^{2+}$ from albumin, increasing the ionized calcium concentration.\n\nThis patient is in a state of respiratory alkalosis, with an arterial pH of $7.52$. This alkalosis is causing an increase in calcium binding to albumin, leading to a clinically significant decrease in ionized calcium, which explains the patient's symptoms despite a \"normal\" corrected total calcium. This demonstrates why direct measurement of an ABG and ionized calcium is superior to calculated estimates in critically ill patients with concurrent acid-base disturbances.\n\nThe problem requires calculating the patient's *in vivo* ionized calcium at the bedside pH of $7.52$, using the provided normalized value and correction rule. The point-of-care analyzer has reported an ionized calcium value of $1.10\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, which has been algorithmically adjusted to what it would be at a standard pH of $7.40$.
