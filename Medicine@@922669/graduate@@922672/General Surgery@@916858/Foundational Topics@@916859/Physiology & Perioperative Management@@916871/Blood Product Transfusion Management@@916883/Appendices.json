The Estimated Blood Volume (EBV) for adults is $70$ milliliters per kilogram. One unit of Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) is transfused. The PRBC unit has a total volume of $300$ milliliters and a hematocrit of $0.70$. Assume the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) in red cells is $34$ grams per deciliter of red cell fraction. During the transfusion, there is ongoing whole-blood loss totaling $250$ milliliters.

Fresh frozen plasma alone", "solution": "The problem requires interpreting a thromboelastography (TEG) tracing in a massively bleeding trauma patient to guide component therapy. A systematic analysis of each parameter is necessary to select the correct combination of products.\n\n1.  **Analyze the TEG Parameters:**\n    *   **Reaction time (R time) $> 10$ minutes:** The R time reflects the time until initial fibrin formation, which is dependent on the concentration and function of coagulation factors. A prolonged R time indicates a deficiency of these factors. The standard treatment is Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), which contains a full complement of factors.\n    *   **Maximum amplitude (MA) $ 45$ millimeters:** The MA represents the maximum strength of the developed clot. It is primarily determined by platelet number and function (approximately $80\\%$) and, to a lesser extent, fibrinogen concentration. A low MA in a bleeding trauma patient indicates a quantitative or qualitative platelet defect and/or hypofibrinogenemia. This requires platelet transfusion.\n    *   **Fibrinolysis at 30 minutes (LY30) $> 3\\%$:** The LY30 measures the percentage of clot lysis $30$ minutes after MA is achieved. An elevated LY30 is diagnostic of hyperfibrinolysis—the premature breakdown of the clot. This condition is treated with an antifibrinolytic agent, such as tranexamic acid (TXA).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Therapeutic Options:**\n    *   **A. Platelet transfusion, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and tranexamic acid (TXA):** This bundle systematically addresses all three derangements identified by the TEG. Platelets for the low MA, FFP for the prolonged R time, and TXA for the elevated LY30. This is the correct, comprehensive approach. **Correct**.\n    *   **B. Packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa):** While RBCs are needed for oxygen-carrying capacity, they do not correct the coagulopathy. rFVIIa could shorten the R time but does not provide platelets for the low MA and has no effect on hyperfibrinolysis. This is an incomplete and potentially inappropriate therapy. **Incorrect**.\n    *   **C. Cryoprecipitate and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) without platelets:** Cryoprecipitate would provide fibrinogen (addressing part of the low MA), and PCC would address the prolonged R time. However, this option explicitly excludes platelets, failing to treat the primary cause of low MA, and it also fails to address the hyperfibrinolysis (high LY30). **Incorrect**.\n    *   **D. Heparin infusion and desmopressin:** Heparin is an anticoagulant and would be catastrophic in a hemorrhaging patient. Desmopressin has a very limited role in trauma coagulopathy. This option is contraindicated. **Incorrect**.\n    *   **E. Fresh frozen plasma alone:** FFP would address the prolonged R time but would not sufficiently correct the platelet-driven low MA or the hyperfibrinolysis. This is an incomplete therapy. **Incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, the only option that addresses all three critical components of the patient's coagulopathy is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4604010"}, {"introduction": "An adverse reaction during a transfusion is a clinical emergency that demands a swift, systematic response. This practice guides you through the essential workup of a patient who develops a fever during a platelet transfusion [@problem_id:4604055]. You will apply a structured diagnostic algorithm—evaluating for clerical errors, hemolysis, and sepsis—to distinguish a life-threatening event from a more common febrile non-hemolytic reaction, reinforcing a critical patient safety protocol.", "problem": "A 68-year-old man undergoing elective colorectal resection develops a new fever during a prophylactic platelet transfusion for preoperative thrombocytopenia. His baseline temperature was $36.8\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; at approximately $t=18\\,\\mathrm{min}$ after starting the platelet transfusion, his temperature is $38.6\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, heart rate $95/\\mathrm{min}$, blood pressure $122/68\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, respiratory rate $16/\\mathrm{min}$, and oxygen saturation $98\\%$ on room air. He reports feeling cold but denies chest pain, dyspnea, flank or back pain, or dark urine. On recognition of a suspected transfusion reaction, the operating room team immediately stops the transfusion, maintains intravenous access with normal saline, and notifies the blood bank.\n\nA standardized workup is initiated. A bedside clerical check confirms correct patient identification and that the unit number, blood type, and expiration date match the transfusion record. The patient’s type is group $A$ Rh positive; the apheresis platelet unit is group $O$ (standard titer) and was issued within the last $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$. Visual inspection of the platelet bag shows no clots, gas, or discoloration. A post-reaction blood sample is obtained: the plasma appears straw-colored without visible pink/red discoloration. Laboratory testing shows plasma-free hemoglobin $20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, serum haptoglobin $85\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ (within the laboratory reference range), lactate dehydrogenase $225\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ (near baseline), and urine negative for hemoglobin. A Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT; also known as the direct Coombs test) on the patient’s red blood cells (RBCs) is negative for both immunoglobulin $G$ (IgG) and complement component $C3d$.

Classify as febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction; after excluding hemolysis, clerical error, and early evidence of bacterial contamination, manage symptomatically (e.g., acetaminophen), notify the blood bank, and consider resuming transfusion with a new leukoreduced platelet unit if clinically needed.\n\nB. Classify as acute hemolytic transfusion reaction from donor anti-$A$ in group $O$ platelet plasma; initiate aggressive intravenous fluids and diuresis for hemoglobinuria and disseminated intravascular coagulation risk, and permanently stop transfusion.\n\nC. Classify as septic transfusion reaction; immediately administer broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and do not resume transfusion regardless of subsequent culture results, as platelets stored at room temperature are high risk for contamination.\n\nD. Classify as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI); administer diuretics and ventilatory support and avoid future donor exposures by using washed RBCs for subsequent transfusions.\n\nE. Classify as delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction due to an anamnestic antibody response; send an extended red cell antibody panel and resume the platelet transfusion once acetaminophen is given.", "solution": "The problem requires classifying an acute transfusion reaction and determining the appropriate management plan based on a systematic clinical and laboratory workup. The key is to differentiate between common, less severe reactions and life-threatening emergencies.\n\n1.  **Systematic Evaluation of Potential Diagnoses:**\n    *   **Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (AHTR):** This is the most feared immediate complication. It's typically caused by ABO incompatibility, leading to intravascular hemolysis. In this case, the Group A patient received Group O platelets (which contain anti-A plasma). However, the workup for hemolysis is definitively negative: plasma is clear (not pink), plasma-free hemoglobin is low, haptoglobin is normal (not depleted), and the Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) is negative. This rules out a clinically significant AHTR.\n    *   **Septic Transfusion Reaction:** This is caused by bacterial contamination of the product (a notable risk for platelets stored at room temperature). While fever and chills are present, the patient is hemodynamically stable, and the urgent Gram stain is negative. While sepsis cannot be definitively ruled out until cultures are final, the immediate picture makes a fulminant septic reaction less likely. The initial steps (stopping the transfusion, obtaining cultures) were appropriate to manage this risk.\n    *   **Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI):** This is characterized by acute respiratory distress. This patient has a normal respiratory rate, excellent oxygen saturation, and denies dyspnea. TRALI is therefore ruled out.\n    *   **Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (DHTR):** As the name implies, this reaction occurs days to weeks after transfusion, not acutely within minutes. This diagnosis is incorrect based on timing.\n    *   **Febrile Nonhemolytic Transfusion Reaction (FNHTR):** This is a diagnosis of exclusion, defined by a fever (typically a rise of $\\ge 1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) and/or chills during or shortly after transfusion, with no other identifiable cause. The patient's presentation (fever of $1.8\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, chills, stable vital signs) and the negative workup for hemolysis and TRALI make FNHTR the most likely diagnosis.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Management Options based on the Diagnosis:**\n    *   **A. Classify as FNHTR; manage symptomatically and consider resuming transfusion with a new unit.** This aligns perfectly with the diagnosis. The workup has excluded more serious causes, management is symptomatic (acetaminophen), and transfusion can be reconsidered with a new unit if needed. **Correct**.\n    *   **B. Classify as AHTR; initiate aggressive management for hemolysis.** This is incorrect as AHTR was ruled out by the laboratory workup.\n    *   **C. Classify as septic reaction; administer broad-spectrum antibiotics.** This is premature and overly aggressive given the stable clinical picture and negative Gram stain. Antibiotics are not indicated at this stage.\n    *   **D. Classify as TRALI; administer diuretics.** This is incorrect as the patient has no respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, diuretics are contraindicated in TRALI.\n    *   **E. Classify as delayed hemolytic reaction; resume the same transfusion.** This diagnosis is incorrect due to timing, and it is standard practice not to resume transfusion from a unit that has caused a reaction.\n\nThe systematic workup points to FNHTR, and the management described in option A is the standard of care for this common reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4604055"}]}
