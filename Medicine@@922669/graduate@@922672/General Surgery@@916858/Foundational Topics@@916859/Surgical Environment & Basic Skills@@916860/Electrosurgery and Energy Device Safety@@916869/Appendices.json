We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the root-mean-square (RMS) current, $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, and RMS voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, for a an alternating current (AC) circuit with a purely resistive load. The derivation must be based on three principles: the definition of RMS for a sinusoidal steady state, Ohm's law, and the time-average power relation. The final numerical values are to be computed for a given average power $P$ and resistance $R$.\n\nLet the instantaneous voltage be $v(t) = V_p \\sin(\\omega t)$ and the instantaneous current be $i(t) = I_p \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $V_p$ and $I_p$ are the peak amplitudes, and the load is purely resistive, ensuring the voltage and current are in phase.\n\nThe RMS voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, is defined as the square root of the mean of the square of the instantaneous voltage over one period. For a sinusoidal waveform, this evaluates to $V_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\frac{V_p}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Similarly, the RMS current is $I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\frac{I_p}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe first principle to be used is Ohm's law for a purely resistive load. This law applies to the instantaneous values, $v(t) = i(t) R$, and consequently to the peak values, $V_p = I_p R$. It can also be expressed in terms of RMS values:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rms}} = I_{\\mathrm{rms}} R \\quad (1)$$\n\nThe second principle is the time-average power, $P$, dissipated in a resistive circuit. For a sinusoidal AC source, the average power dissipated by a resistor is given by the product of the RMS voltage and the RMS current:\n$$P = V_{\\mathrm{rms}} I_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\quad (2)$$\nThis relation is a direct consequence of averaging the instantaneous power $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$ over one cycle, which yields $P = \\frac{V_p I_p}{2} = \\left(\\frac{V_p}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{I_p}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = V_{\\mathrm{rms}} I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving expressions for $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ in terms of $P$ and $R$.\n\nTo derive the expression for $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, we can eliminate $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ from the system of equations.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires the derivation of the expression for current density $J$ and its subsequent calculation. By its fundamental definition provided in the problem, electric current density is the amount of electric current $I$ flowing perpendicularly through a surface of area $A$. Given the assumption of spatial uniformity, the scalar magnitude of the current density vector is constant across the area, and the relationship is:\n$$J = \\frac{I}{A}$$\nIn this specific context, the area is the effective conductive contact area, $A_{\\text{eff}}$. Therefore, the expression for the current density is:\n$$J = \\frac{I}{A_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nThe givens are the root-mean-square current $I = 1.0\\,\\text{A}$ and the effective area $A_{\\text{eff}} = 150\\,\\text{cm}^2$. We can compute the numerical value of $J$ using these values.\n$$J = \\frac{1.0\\,\\text{A}}{150\\,\\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{1}{150}\\,\\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.00666... \\,\\text{A}/\\text{cm}^2$.\n\nThe problem then asks to relate this computed value to the safety threshold, $J_{\\text{th}} = 0.02\\,\\text{A}/\\text{cm}^2$. Comparing the two values:\n$$J \\approx 0.0067\\,\\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\n$$J_{\\text{th}} = 0.02\\,\\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\nSince $0.0067 < 0.02$, the calculated current density $J$ at the return electrode is substantially below the conservative safety threshold $J_{\\text{th}}$. This indicates that, under these specified operating conditions and assuming uniform contact, the risk of thermal injury (a patient burn) at the dispersive pad site is low.\n\nFinally, the problem requires the numerical answer for the current density to be expressed in units of $\\text{A}/\\text{m}^2$ and rounded to four significant figures.

The relevant principles are the dissipation of electrical power, the relationship between energy and power, and calorimetry.\n\n**1. Electrical Power Dissipation (Joule's First Law)**\n\nThe instantaneous electrical power, $P$, dissipated as heat in a purely resistive element is given by Joule's first law. Given a constant current, $I$, flowing through a constant resistance, $R$, the power is:\n$$P = I^2 R$$\n\n**2. Energy-Time Relationship**\n\nFor a constant power, $P$, applied over a time interval, $t$, the total energy, $E$, delivered is the product of power and time. In this context, this energy is entirely converted to heat, which we will denote as $Q_{elec}$.\n$$Q_{elec} = P \\cdot t$$\nSubstituting the expression for power from the first principle, we obtain the total heat energy generated by the current:\n$$Q_{elec} = (I^2 R) t = I^2 R t$$\n\n**3.

Derivation of the Temperature Rise Expression**\n\nThe problem states that heat loss from the control volume during the brief burst is negligible. This is a crucial assumption that allows us to apply the principle of conservation of energy by equating the electrical energy dissipated as heat to the thermal energy absorbed by the tissue.\n$$Q_{elec} = Q_{thermal}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived from the principles above:\n$$I^2 R t = m c \\Delta T$$\nTo find the expression for the temperature rise, $\\Delta T$, we rearrange this equation by isolating $\\Delta T$:\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{I^2 R t}{m c}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the temperature rise at the contact, based on the specified first principles and assumptions.\n\n**5.
