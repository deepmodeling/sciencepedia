Failure of the pre-incision “time-out” to correctly confirm identity/site/procedure.\n    2. Missed intraoperative antibiotic redosing in prolonged cases.\n    3. An unreconciled instrument or sponge count discrepancy at closure.\n- An ordinal rating scale from $1$ to $10$ is used for three metrics:\n    - Severity ($S$): Higher numbers indicate greater severity of harm.\n    - Occurrence ($O$): Higher numbers indicate higher frequency of occurrence.\n    - Detection ($D$): Higher numbers indicate poorer detectability (i.e., less likely to be detected).\n- For each of the three failure modes, the assigned ratings are identical: $S = 9$, $O = 4$, and $D = 3$.\n- The task requires the derivation of a \"multiplicative priority score that is proportional to severity, frequency, and difficulty of detection\".\n- The task requires the computation of this numerical score.\n- The task requires a discussion on prioritizing mitigations and proposing one system-level mitigation for each failure mode.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically grounded. FMEA is a standard, well-established engineering and systems-analysis methodology widely applied in high-reliability fields, including healthcare and surgery, for proactive risk assessment. The concepts of Severity, Occurrence, and Detection, and their combination into a Risk Priority Number, are the core components of FMEA. The specific failure modes listed are canonical and critical patient safety issues in surgery.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical data ($S$, $O$, $D$) and explicitly directs the derivation of a specific mathematical form for the risk score (multiplicative and proportional to the inputs). This structure leads to a unique and meaningful numerical solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, precise language, free of subjective claims. It describes a standardized process (FMEA) and provides quantitative inputs.\n\n**Flaw Checklist Assessment:**\n1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness:** None. The premises conform to standard risk management principles.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant:** None. The problem is directly formalizable into a mathematical expression and is explicitly on the required topic of surgical patient safety and quality improvement.\n3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory Setup:** None. The data provided are sufficient and consistent.\n4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible:** None. The context and the assigned numerical ratings are plausible within a hospital setting.\n5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured:** None. The problem structure uniquely determines the solution.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial:** While the final calculation is elementary, the requirement to derive the scoring model from first principles and justify mitigations elevates it beyond a trivial exercise. It assesses conceptual understanding of the FMEA model.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** None. The calculation is deterministic and verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- **Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n- **Action:** A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Discussion**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a priority score based on fundamental risk assessment principles. The guiding principles stated are that the score must be:\n1.  A monotone increasing function of the magnitude of harm (Severity, $S$).\n2.  A monotone increasing function of the likelihood of the failure (Occurrence, $O$).\n3.  A monotone increasing function of the difficulty of detecting the failure before it causes harm (Detection, $D$).\n\nLet the priority score be denoted by $R$.\n\nFrom the first principle, the risk is proportional to the severity of the consequent harm.\n$$R \\propto S$$\nFrom the second principle, the risk is proportional to the frequency with which the failure occurs.\n$$R \\propto O$$\nFrom the third principle, the risk is elevated for failures that are difficult to detect. The variable $D$ is defined such that higher values correspond to poorer detectability. Therefore, the score should increase with $D$.\n$$R \\propto D$$\n\nThe problem explicitly asks for a \"multiplicative priority score\". Combining these three proportionalities into a single multiplicative relationship yields:\n$$R \\propto S \\cdot O \\cdot D$$\nTo create a formal score, we can introduce a constant of proportionality, $k$.\n$$R = k \\cdot S \\cdot O \\cdot D$$\nIn standard FMEA methodology, this score is known as the Risk Priority Number ($R_{PN}$), and the constant of proportionality is typically set to $k=1$ for simplicity, as the absolute value of the score is less important than its relative value for ranking different failure modes. Thus, we derive the formula for the priority score:\n$$R_{PN} = S \\times O \\times D$$\nThis derived formula satisfies all the conditions set forth in the problem statement.\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value of the priority score for each of the three identified failure modes. The given ratings are $S = 9$, $O = 4$, and $D = 3$.\n$$R_{PN} = 9 \\times 4 \\times 3$$\n$$R_{PN} = 36 \\times 3$$\n$$R_{PN} = 108$$\nSince all three failure modes were assigned the same ratings, they all share this common priority score of $108$.\n\nRegarding the prioritization of mitigation efforts, the problem states this must be based *solely* on these priority scores. Because all three failure modes have an identical $R_{PN}$ of $108$, there is no basis for prioritizing one over another using this metric alone. They are of equal priority. In a practical FMEA, one might further consider that the Severity rating ($S=9$) is exceptionally high for all three, suggesting that any failure mode with such a high severity rating warrants immediate attention, regardless of the final $R_{PN}$. However, strictly adhering to the prompt's constraint, no prioritization is possible.\n\nThe following are proposed concrete, system-level mitigations for each failure mode, designed to favorably change at least one of the $S$, $O$, or $D$ ratings.\n\n1.  **Failure Mode: Incorrect Pre-Incision Time-Out.**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a \"forcing function\" within the electronic health record (EHR) system. The system would require the circulating nurse to electronically verify and check off key data points (patient name, anagraphic data, operative site, side, and procedure) against the informed consent and pre-operative orders. The system would prevent the case from being marked as \"ready for incision\" and would inhibit the generation of billing codes for the procedure's start until this electronic checklist is complete.\n    *   **Justification:** This system-level control primarily targets the Detection ($D$) rating. It creates a hard stop, making it nearly impossible for a discrepancy to go undetected up to the point of incision. By enforcing a standardized workflow, it may also secondarily reduce the Occurrence ($O$) of process deviations. The Severity ($S=9$) of a wrong-site surgery remains unchanged, as the potential outcome is still catastrophic if the defenses fail.\n\n2.  **Failure Mode: Missed Intraoperative Antibiotic Redosing.**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Integrate an automated, timed alert into the electronic anesthesia information management system (AIMS). Upon documentation of the initial antibiotic administration, the AIMS would automatically calculate and schedule the next dose based on the specific drug's pharmacokinetic profile. A non-silenceable, high-visibility alarm would activate on the anesthesiologist's primary monitor $15$ minutes before the dose is due.\n    *   **Justification:** This mitigation targets both Occurrence ($O$) and Detection ($D$). It reduces Occurrence by offloading the cognitive burden of time-tracking from the provider. It improves Detection by creating a salient, unavoidable prompt, ensuring that an impending need for redosing is not missed. The Severity ($S$) of a potential postoperative surgical site infection would not change.\n\n3.  **Failure Mode: Unreconciled Instrument or Sponge Count.**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking system for all surgical sponges and high-risk instruments. Each tagged item is electronically scanned as it is brought onto the sterile field, and a dedicated scanner at the exit point of the field (e.g., a smart bucket or mat) automatically decrements the count as items are removed. The system would maintain a continuous, real-time count and generate an alert if a discrepancy exists when the team initiates the closure count procedure.\n    *   **Justification:** This technological solution dramatically improves Detection ($D$) by replacing error-prone manual counting with an automated, verified process. It also reduces the Occurrence ($O$) of count discrepancies by minimizing human error in the counting process itself. The Severity ($S=9$) associated with a retained foreign object remains high.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{108}\n$$", "id": "4676708"}, {"introduction": "After prioritizing a risk, the next step in the quality improvement cycle is to implement a change and measure its impact.

Using the fundamental definition that relative risk is the ratio of probabilities of the outcome in the exposed versus unexposed groups and that overall risk is the weighted average of group-specific risks by their proportions, derive the new overall SSI rate attributable solely to the change in antibiotic timing and the absolute risk reduction.
