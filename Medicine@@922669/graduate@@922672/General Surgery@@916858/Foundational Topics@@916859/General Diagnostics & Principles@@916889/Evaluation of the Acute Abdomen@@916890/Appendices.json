I will first validate the problem statement according to the specified protocol.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n- A $64$-year-old patient presents with an acute abdomen.\n- Clinical signs: abrupt-onset (6 hours) severe, diffuse abdominal pain, guarding, rebound tenderness, distended and tympanic abdomen, involuntary rigidity.\n- Vital signs: Heart Rate (HR) is $120$ beats per minute. Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) is $90$ mm Hg.\n- Definition: The Shock Index (SI) is defined as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure, i.e., $SI = \\frac{HR}{SBP}$.\n- Requirement: Compute the value of the Shock Index, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nI will now assess the validity of the problem based on the extracted givens.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is set in a clinical context (emergency medicine, general surgery) and uses standard medical terminology and concepts. The patient's presentation is a classic description of peritonitis. The vital signs ($HR = 120$, $SBP = 90$) are realistic for a patient developing septic or hypovolemic shock. The Shock Index ($SI$) is a real and commonly used hemodynamic metric, defined correctly as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information for a solution. It gives the explicit formula for the Shock Index and the values of the variables ($HR$ and $SBP$) required for the calculation. The request for a numerical answer rounded to a specific number of significant figures ensures a unique and clear solution. Therefore, the problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The language is objective and clinical. It describes a scenario and asks for a calculation based on a provided definition. There are no subjective, opinion-based, or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed for invalidation. It is scientifically sound, fully specified, contains no contradictions, and is framed in clear, objective language. The calculation is straightforward but requires correct application of the definition and adherence to rounding rules, making it a valid, solvable problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with providing a complete solution.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Shock Index ($SI$) for a patient based on provided vital signs. The definition of the Shock Index is given as the ratio of the heart rate ($HR$) to the systolic blood pressure ($SBP$).\n\nThe formula is:\n$$SI = \\frac{HR}{SBP}$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\n- Heart Rate, $HR = 120$ beats per minute.\n- Systolic Blood Pressure, $SBP = 90$ mm Hg.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$SI = \\frac{120}{90}$$\n\nThe calculation proceeds by simplifying the fraction:\n$$SI = \\frac{12}{9} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$SI = 1.3333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three digits are $1$, $3$, and $3$. The fourth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$. Therefore, we do not round up the third significant figure.\n\nThe value of the Shock Index, rounded to three significant figures, is $1.33$.

Decision analysis provides a structured way to evaluate these trade-offs by modeling potential outcomes and their associated probabilities. This advanced practice challenges you to build an expected utility model for a critically ill patient, allowing you to calculate a precise time threshold beyond which delaying surgery for imaging becomes the inferior strategy.

You must choose between immediate laparotomy in the Operating Room (OR) versus obtaining Computed Tomography (CT) imaging first. Model the decision using expected utility with utility of survival equal to $1$ and utility of death equal to $0$, and assume CT perfectly discriminates surgical from nonsurgical conditions (no false results). The disease model is as follows.\n\nThere are two mutually exclusive states. With probability $p$, the patient has a rapidly fatal intraabdominal hemorrhage that is definitively treated by laparotomy. With probability $1 - p$, the patient has a benign/nonsurgical condition for which laparotomy would confer only harm (iatrogenic mortality). For the hemorrhagic state, if laparotomy is performed immediately, the probability of survival is $s_{0}$. If laparotomy is delayed by $D$ minutes due to imaging and transfer, survival follows an exponential time-to-death model with a constant hazard, so the survival probability becomes $s_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda D)$. For the benign state, immediate laparotomy confers an iatrogenic mortality $m$, so survival is $1 - m$, whereas CT-first yields no iatrogenic mortality and survival is $1$.\n\nLet $p = 0.5$, $s_{0} = 0.8$, and $m = 0.08$.

It is scientifically grounded in a simplified but valid representation of a surgical dilemma and uses standard mathematical models for survival analysis. All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the expected utilities of two strategies: immediate laparotomy (henceforth denoted OR) and obtaining a Computed Tomography (CT) scan first (denoted CT). The utility of survival is given as $1$ and the utility of death as $0$. Consequently, the expected utility of any strategy is numerically equal to its overall probability of survival.

The utility contribution is $p \\cdot s_{0}$.\n- If the patient has a benign condition (probability $1-p$), immediate (and unnecessary) laparotomy results in a survival probability of $1-m$.
