The problem is well-posed and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Michaelis-Menten Equation**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via the mechanism:\n$$\nE + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{\\rightarrow} E + P\n$$\nThe rate of product formation, which under initial-rate conditions ($[P] \\approx 0$) is the initial velocity $v_0$, is determined by the breakdown of the enzyme-substrate complex:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES]\n$$\nTo express $v_0$ in terms of substrate concentration $[S]$ and total enzyme concentration $[E]_T$, we must find an expression for $[ES]$. We apply the steady-state approximation, which posits that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant over the time scale of interest. This means its rate of formation equals its rate of consumption:\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThe rate of formation of $[ES]$ is from the forward reaction of $E$ and $S$. The rates of consumption of $[ES]$ are from its dissociation back to $E$ and $S$, and its conversion to $E$ and $P$. Thus, we can write the balance equation for $[ES]$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of formation} = \\text{Rate of consumption}\n$$\n$$\nk_1 [E] [S] = k_{-1} [ES] + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nTo solve for $[ES]$, we need to eliminate the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$. We use the conservation of enzyme equation, which states that the total enzyme concentration $[E]_T$ is the sum of the free enzyme $[E]$ and the enzyme bound in the complex $[ES]$:\n$$\n[E]_T = [E] + [ES]\n$$\nRearranging for $[E]$ gives:\n$$\n[E] = [E]_T - [ES]\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state rate balance equation:\n$$\nk_1 ([E]_T - [ES]) [S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nNow, we solve for $[ES]$.

The Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as:\n$$\nK_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}\n$$\nSubstituting $K_m$ into the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[ES]$ back into the equation for the initial rate, $v_0 = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES]$:\n$$\nv_0 = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\left( \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThe problem defines the maximum velocity, $V_{\\max}$, as the rate when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate ($[ES] = [E]_T$). This corresponds to $V_{\\max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T$. Substituting this definition yields the final form of the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Initial Rate**\n\nWe are given the following parameters for the tyrosinase-catalyzed reaction:\n- Maximum velocity, $V_{\\max} = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$.\n- Michaelis constant, $K_m = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Substrate concentration, $[S] = [\\mathrm{L\\mbox{-}tyrosine}] = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nWe must ensure the units are consistent before calculation.

The resulting unit for $v_0$ will be the unit of $V_{\\max}$, which is $\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$, as requested.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the derived Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{(100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}) (0.1\\ \\mathrm{mM})}{0.2\\ \\mathrm{mM} + 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mM}}\n$$\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{100 \\cdot 0.1}{0.3}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}\n$$\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{10}{0.3}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min} = \\frac{100}{3}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nv_0 = 33.333... \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nv_0 \\approx 33.33\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}\n$$\nThis is the initial rate of the reaction under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{33.33}\n$$", "id": "4458923"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamental kinetics of tyrosinase, we now explore how its activity can be modulated, a concept with direct applications in clinical dermatology for treating pigmentary disorders.

The analysis will proceed by first defining the initial velocity for the uninhibited enzyme, then for the competitively inhibited enzyme, and finally by calculating their ratio. The framework for this analysis is the Michaelis–Menten model of enzyme kinetics.\n\nThe initial velocity, $v_0$, of an enzymatic reaction following Michaelis–Menten kinetics is given by the equation:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximal velocity, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial velocity for the uninhibited reaction, which we shall denote as $v_{uninhibited}$. The problem states that the substrate concentration is set to be equal to the uninhibited Michaelis constant, i.e., $[S] = K_m$. Substituting this condition into the Michaelis–Menten equation yields:\n$$v_{uninhibited} = \\frac{V_{max} K_m}{K_m + K_m} = \\frac{V_{max} K_m}{2 K_m}$$\nUpon simplification, by canceling the $K_m$ term from the numerator and denominator, we find the uninhibited initial rate:\n$$v_{uninhibited} = \\frac{V_{max}}{2}$$\nThis result is a fundamental property of Michaelis-Menten kinetics: when the substrate concentration equals the Michaelis constant, the reaction proceeds at exactly half of its maximal velocity.\n\nNext, we consider the case of competitive inhibition. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds reversibly to the enzyme's active site, competing with the substrate. This type of inhibition affects the apparent Michaelis constant, increasing it, but does not alter the maximal velocity, $V_{max}$, as the effect of the inhibitor can be overcome by sufficiently high substrate concentrations.\n\nThe Michaelis–Menten equation for a competitively inhibited reaction is:\n$$v_{inhibited} = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m^{app} + [S]}$$\nwhere $v_{inhibited}$ is the initial velocity in the presence of the inhibitor, and $K_m^{app}$ is the apparent Michaelis constant. For competitive inhibition, $K_m^{app}$ is related to the uninhibited $K_m$ by the factor $(1 + [I]/K_I)$, where $[I]$ is the inhibitor concentration and $K_I$ is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. However, the problem provides a more direct statement: the inhibitor increases the Michaelis constant by a factor of $2$. Therefore, we can directly write:\n$$K_m^{app} = 2 K_m$$\n\nWe are asked to calculate the inhibited rate at the same substrate concentration as before, which is $[S] = K_m$ (where $K_m$ remains the Michaelis constant of the uninhibited enzyme).

We compute this ratio:\n$$\\frac{v_{inhibited}}{v_{uninhibited}} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{max}}{3}}{\\frac{V_{max}}{2}}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{v_{inhibited}}{v_{uninhibited}} = \\frac{V_{max}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{V_{max}} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{max}$, cancels out, yielding a dimensionless number as required.

Tyrosinase is a copper-dependent oxidase whose catalytic efficiency increases as pH rises from acidic toward near-neutral values, reflecting improved substrate deprotonation, favorable active-site protonation states, and stabilization of the di-copper active site necessary for $o$-diphenol oxidation. In melanosomes, excessive acidity inhibits tyrosinase activity and shifts melanogenesis away from eumelanin; alkalinization toward near-neutral pH alleviates this inhibition and favors eumelanogenesis.

Melanosomal pH falls and tyrosinase activity decreases, but eumelanogenesis increases due to compensatory polymerization. The first clause contradicts the flux-balance result (pH should rise). Moreover, compensatory polymerization does not overcome the rate-limiting enzymatic oxidation step governed by tyrosinase at acidic pH. Incorrect.\n- C. Melanosomal pH rises, but destabilization of tyrosinase copper centers reduces activity, decreasing eumelanogenesis. Empirically and mechanistically, tyrosinase activity is inhibited by low pH and increases as pH approaches near-neutral; rising pH does not destabilize the active site in a way that reduces activity under physiological ranges.

Melanosomal pH falls, favoring pheomelanogenesis via enhanced cysteine incorporation, thereby reducing eumelanogenesis. The direction of pH change is wrong; doubling anion conductance increases pH. Although more acidic conditions can favor pheomelanogenesis, the premise here (pH falls) is incorrect in this scenario.
