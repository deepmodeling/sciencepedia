For a set of $S$ taxa with relative abundances $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_S$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i = 1$ and $p_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$, the Shannon entropy is defined. The problem specifies the use of the natural logarithm, so the entropy will be in units of nats. The formula is:\n$$ H = - \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i) $$\nBy convention, the term $p_i \\ln(p_i)$ is taken to be $0$ if $p_i = 0$.\n\nThe problem provides a bacterial community at the genus level summarized by a vector of relative abundances $p = (0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1)$. This corresponds to a community with $S=4$ distinct taxa. The given abundances are $p_1 = 0.5$, $p_2 = 0.2$, $p_3 = 0.2$, and $p_4 = 0.1$. We verify that these sum to $1$: $0.5 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0$.\n\nWe can now substitute these values into the Shannon entropy formula:\n$$ H = - \\left[ p_1 \\ln(p_1) + p_2 \\ln(p_2) + p_3 \\ln(p_3) + p_4 \\ln(p_4) \\right] $$\n$$ H = - \\left[ 0.5 \\ln(0.5) + 0.2 \\ln(0.2) + 0.2 \\ln(0.2) + 0.1 \\ln(0.1) \\right] $$\nThis can be simplified as:\n$$ H = - \\left[ 0.5 \\ln(0.5) + 2 \\times 0.2 \\ln(0.2) + 0.1 \\ln(0.1) \\right] $$\nUsing the property $\\ln(x) = -\\ln(1/x)$:\n$\\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(2)$\n$\\ln(0.2) = -\\ln(5)$\n$\\ln(0.1) = -\\ln(10)$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $H$:\n$$ H = - \\left[ 0.5 (-\\ln(2)) + 0.4 (-\\ln(5)) + 0.1 (-\\ln(10)) \\right] $$\n$$ H = 0.5 \\ln(2) + 0.4 \\ln(5) + 0.1 \\ln(10) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ H = 0.5 \\times (0.693147...) + 0.4 \\times (1.609438...) + 0.1 \\times (2.302585...) $$\n$$ H \\approx 0.346574 + 0.643775 + 0.230259 $$\n$$ H \\approx 1.220608 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ H \\approx 1.221 $$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this value. The problem states as an established observation that \"dry sites such as the volar forearm typically exhibit higher within-sample (alpha) diversity... due to a longer tail of low-abundance taxa\". This context is critical for interpretation.\n\nAlpha diversity, as measured by Shannon entropy, incorporates two components: richness (the number of taxa, $S$) and evenness (the uniformity of their relative abundances).\n1.  **Richness:** The provided community has a richness of $S=4$. Actual microbiome samples from the volar forearm, when analyzed with contemporary rRNA gene sequencing, typically reveal a vastly higher richness, often comprising tens to hundreds of genera. A richness of only $4$ is exceedingly low for this body site.\n2.  **Evenness and Tail:** The phrase \"a longer tail of low-abundance taxa\" implies a community structure with a few dominant taxa and a large number of rare taxa. The given community structure, $p=(0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1)$, lacks this \"long tail\" entirely, as it contains only $4$ members in total. High richness, particularly the presence of many rare taxa, is a primary driver of high Shannon entropy values.\n3.  **Comparison to Literature Values:** Empirical studies of the healthy skin microbiome consistently report Shannon diversity values for the volar forearm that are substantially higher than the value we calculated. Typical values reported in the literature are generally in the range of $H = 2.5$ to $H = 4.0$ nats, and can be even higher depending on sequencing depth and analytical methods.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the computed entropy of $H \\approx 1.221$ nats is very low and not representative of the high diversity typically found on a healthy volar forearm. The calculation reflects a community with extremely low richness and no long tail of rare taxa, which contradicts the known ecological characteristics of this dry skin environment.

On the skin, factors like water activity ($a_w$), nutrient availability, pH, and oxygen levels act as powerful ecological filters.

Oxygen tension is near atmospheric. You are to predict the three most abundant resident bacterial genera expected at this site and choose the best option from the list.\n\nBase your prediction on first principles that govern microbial colonization under resource limitation and water availability on keratinized surfaces, using the following well-established foundations:\n\n- Water activity is defined as $a_w = p/p^\\ast$, where $p$ is the partial pressure of water vapor above the surface and $p^\\ast$ is the saturation vapor pressure at the same temperature. Under equilibrium with ambient air of relative humidity $\\mathrm{RH}$, $a_w \\approx \\mathrm{RH}/100$. On human stratum corneum, hygroscopic solutes (collectively referred to as the natural moisturizing factor) raise microfilm $a_w$ above ambient, but $a_w$ still scales with ambient $\\mathrm{RH}$.\n- Microbial growth on surfaces can be represented by resource-limited kinetics in which the specific growth rate $\\,\\mu\\,$ depends on the minimum of constraints imposed by nutrient concentration and water availability, for example $\\,\\mu = \\mu_{\\max}\\,\\min\\left(\\dfrac{S}{K_S + S},\\,f(a_w)\\right)\\,$, where $S$ is the concentration of the limiting nutrient, $K_S$ is the half-saturation constant, and $f(a_w)$ is a decreasing function as $a_w$ falls below the organism’s tolerance threshold.\n- Sebum is a lipid-rich nutrient source composed primarily of triglycerides, wax esters, free fatty acids, cholesterol, and squalene; its availability per unit area scales with the measured sebum level in mg/cm$^2$. Lipophilic, anaerobic organisms with strong lipase activity are favored when sebum is high and oxygen is restricted, whereas generalist, desiccation- and salt-tolerant Gram-positive organisms are favored when water is limiting and sebum is low.\n- The acid mantle at pH $5.5$ imposes acid stress that is tolerated by many skin commensals; differential tolerance and metabolism at low pH can influence competitive fitness.\n\nGiven these site parameters ($\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$, sebum $= 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm}^2$, ambient $\\mathrm{RH} = 40\\%$), which trio of resident bacterial genera is most likely to be the three most abundant on the forearm, assuming steady-state colonization dominated by organisms that maximize $\\,\\mu\\,$ under the combined constraints of nutrient and water limitation at this dry, non-sebaceous, oxygenated site?\n\nChoose one option:\n\nA.

Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium, Bacillus", "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters for a site on the forearm of an adult with clinically normal skin:\n-   Surface hydrogen ion concentration: $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$\n-   Sebum level: $0.2\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm}^2$\n-   Ambient relative humidity (RH): $40\\%$\n-   Oxygen tension: Near atmospheric\n-   The question is to predict the three most abundant resident bacterial genera.\n\nThe problem also supplies the following foundational principles:\n1.  Water activity ($a_w$) is related to relative humidity: $a_w \\approx \\mathrm{RH}/100$.\n2.

Sebum is a lipid-rich nutrient. High sebum and low oxygen favor lipophilic, anaerobic organisms. Low water and low sebum favor generalist, desiccation- and salt-tolerant Gram-positive organisms.\n4.  The acidic $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $5.5$ selects for acid-tolerant commensals.\n\nThe goal is to identify the trio of genera that maximizes growth rate ($\\mu$) under the combined constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of microbial ecology and dermatology. The given parameters ($\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$, low sebum, low RH) are realistic for a dry skin site like the forearm. The relationship between environmental factors and microbial selection (e.g., desiccation tolerance, nutrient metabolism, oxygen requirements) is a cornerstone of microbiology. The kinetic model presented is a standard representation of resource-limited growth.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of environmental conditions and a set of established principles. It asks for a prediction based on applying these principles to the given conditions. A unique, meaningful answer is expected, representing the organisms best adapted to this specific ecological niche.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative parameters and objective scientific principles. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically sound, and well-posed. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is **VALID**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem requires a prediction of the dominant bacterial genera based on the ecological pressures present at the specified skin site. We must analyze each environmental parameter and synthesize a profile of the expected dominant organism type.\n\n1.  **Site Analysis:** The forearm is anatomically classified as a \"dry\" or \"xerotic\" skin site, as opposed to \"sebaceous\" (e.g., forehead) or \"moist\" (e.g., axilla) sites. The provided data confirm this classification.\n2.  **Water Availability:** Ambient $\\mathrm{RH}$ is $40\\%$. According to the provided principle, this corresponds to a low water activity ($a_w$) environment, creating significant desiccation stress. Therefore, organisms must be highly **desiccation-tolerant** (xerotolerant).\n3.  **Nutrient Availability:** The sebum level is $0.2\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm}^2$, which is very low. Sebum is the primary lipid-rich nutrient source. The third principle states that low sebum conditions favor \"generalist\" organisms rather than specialists. Specifically, this condition will select against **lipophilic** organisms that depend on high concentrations of lipids.\n4.  **Oxygen Availability:** The oxygen tension is \"near atmospheric,\" meaning the environment is **aerobic**. This will select against obligate anaerobes and favor aerobes or facultative anaerobes.\n5.  **Acidity:** The $\\mathrm{pH}$ is $5.5$. This is characteristic of the skin's \"acid mantle.\" Dominant resident organisms must be **acid-tolerant**. Most common skin commensals are adapted to this condition, so it is a general filter for skin residency.\n\n**Synthesized Ecological Profile:** The dominant bacteria at this site must be:\n-   Desiccation-tolerant\n-   Aerobic or facultative anaerobic\n-   Not dependent on high lipid concentrations (non-lipophilic generalists)\n-   Acid-tolerant\n-   Gram-positive (as stated by the provided principle for low-water, low-sebum sites)\n\nWe now evaluate the genera listed in the options against this profile.\n\n-   ***Staphylococcus***: Gram-positive cocci. They are facultative anaerobes, renowned for their exceptional tolerance to desiccation and high salinity (osmotic stress). They are metabolic generalists. *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is a quintessential resident of dry skin sites. This genus is an excellent fit.\n-   ***Corynebacterium***: Gram-positive rods. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic, acid-tolerant. They are common skin residents found across various site types. While some species are lipolytic and more abundant in moist/sebaceous sites, others are well-adapted to dry conditions. They are a core member of the skin microbiota and are a strong candidate.\n-   ***Micrococcus***: Gram-positive cocci. They are obligate aerobes and are extremely resistant to desiccation and other environmental stresses. Their presence is consistent with a dry, aerobic environment. This genus is a plausible candidate.\n-   ***Cutibacterium*** (formerly *Propionibacterium*): Gram-positive rods. They are characteristically **lipophilic** and prefer **anaerobic** or microaerophilic environments, such as the interior of sebaceous follicles. The conditions of the forearm (low sebum, high oxygen) are strongly selective *against* this genus. It should not be abundant.\n-   ***Malassezia***: This is a genus of **fungi** (yeasts), not bacteria. The question explicitly asks for the three most abundant resident **bacterial** genera. Furthermore, *Malassezia* species are lipophilic, requiring lipids for growth, making them poorly suited for a low-sebum site. This is an invalid candidate.\n-   ***Pseudomonas***, ***Acinetobacter***, ***Enterobacter***: These are Gram-negative genera. While they can be found on skin, they are typically less abundant than the core Gram-positive residents, especially on dry sites. They are often considered transient colonizers or are more associated with moist environments. The problem's principles specifically point towards Gram-positive dominance in this niche.\n-   ***Lactobacillus***: Gram-positive rods. They are not considered a dominant genus on the skin surface; their primary niche is the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts.\n-   ***Bacillus***: Gram-positive, spore-forming rods. Their spores are highly resistant to desiccation, but they are typically found as transients from the environment (e.g., soil, dust) and are not considered a major component of the *resident* skin microbiome in the same way as *Staphylococcus* or *Corynebacterium*.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus**\n-   *Staphylococcus*: Excellent fit. A desiccation-tolerant, aerobic-thriving generalist.\n-   *Corynebacterium*: Excellent fit. A common, acid-tolerant resident adapted to various skin sites, including dry ones.\n-   *Micrococcus*: Excellent fit. An obligately aerobic, highly desiccation-resistant commensal.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This trio consists entirely of Gram-positive bacteria that are well-adapted to the specified dry, aerobic, low-sebum, acidic environment. They are the expected dominant genera based on the provided first principles.\n\n**B. Cutibacterium, Staphylococcus, Malassezia**\n-   *Cutibacterium*: Incorrect. This genus is lipophilic and anaerobic, making it ill-suited for a low-sebum, aerobic site.\n-   *Malassezia*: Incorrect. This is a fungus, not a bacterium, and it is also lipophilic.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option contains two genera that are fundamentally mismatched with the specified environment and one that is not a bacterium.\n\n**C. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter**\n-   This option lists three Gram-negative genera. The dominant resident flora of dry skin is overwhelmingly Gram-positive. These genera are not expected to be the three *most abundant* residents.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This composition is not representative of the dominant resident community on dry, normal skin.\n\n**D. Cutibacterium, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus**\n-   *Cutibacterium*: Incorrect. Mismatched with the low-sebum, aerobic conditions.\n-   *Lactobacillus*: Incorrect. Not a dominant resident of the skin surface.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option includes two genera not expected to be abundant in this niche.\n\n**E. Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium, Bacillus**\n-   *Cutibacterium*: Incorrect. Mismatched with the low-sebum, aerobic conditions.\n-   *Bacillus*: Plausible due to its resistance, but typically considered a transient genus from the environment, less abundant as a resident than core commensals like *Corynebacterium* or *Micrococcus*.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The inclusion of *Cutibacterium* makes this option a poor prediction for the most abundant genera.\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the provided ecological principles to the site parameters, the trio of *Staphylococcus*, *Corynebacterium*, and *Micrococcus* represents the bacterial community best adapted to thrive under the combined constraints of low water activity, low lipid availability, and high oxygen tension.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4497229"}, {"introduction": "Modern microbiome studies often involve comparing the abundances of hundreds or thousands of taxa between groups, creating a significant multiple testing problem.

They compare relative abundances of four common skin commensal taxa between sebaceous and moist sites using a compositional differential abundance test, yielding the following null hypotheses and associated $p$-values: $H_{1}$ (Cutibacterium acnes): $0.001$, $H_{2}$ (Staphylococcus epidermidis): $0.02$, $H_{3}$ (Corynebacterium spp.): $0.04$, and $H_{4}$ (Malassezia spp.): $0.10$. Assume the test statistics are mutually independent across taxa.\n\nStarting from the definition of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and the principle that multiple testing inflates the expected proportion of false positives among rejections, justify the use of a step-up thresholding approach that controls the expected proportion of false discoveries at a pre-specified level.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution using established statistical principles.\n\nThe task is to determine the number of significant findings from a set of four hypothesis tests after correcting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at a level of $q=0.05$.\n\nFirst, we address the justification for using a step-up thresholding approach like the BH procedure. When conducting multiple hypothesis tests, say $m$ tests, using a fixed significance level $\\alpha$ for each test inflates the probability of making at least one Type I error (a false positive). This is known as the multiple comparisons problem. A classical approach is to control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER), defined as the probability of making one or more false discoveries, $FWER = P(V \\ge 1)$, where $V$ is the number of true null hypotheses that are rejected. However, controlling FWER (e.g., via the Bonferroni correction, which uses a threshold of $\\alpha/m$) is often too stringent, especially for a large number of tests, leading to a significant loss of statistical power and failure to detect true effects.\n\nAn alternative is to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR), proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg. The FDR is the expected proportion of false discoveries among all rejected hypotheses. Let $R$ be the total number of rejected hypotheses and $V$ be the number of false discoveries. The False Discovery Proportion is $Q = V/R$ (defined as $0$ if $R=0$). The FDR is the expectation of this quantity: $FDR = E[Q]$. Controlling the FDR at a level $q$ means ensuring that, on average, no more than a fraction $q$ of the discoveries made are false. This is a more liberal criterion than FWER control and generally provides greater power, which is desirable in exploratory studies like microbiome analysis where many features are tested simultaneously.\n\nThe BH procedure is a step-up method that achieves this control. It works by ordering the $p$-values and comparing them to a sequence of increasing thresholds. The step-up nature refers to finding the highest-ranked (largest) $p$-value that is still small enough to be considered significant, and then declaring it and all smaller $p$-values significant. This adaptive thresholding, $p_{(i)} \\le \\frac{i}{m}q$, correctly balances the trade-off: it is very strict for the smallest $p$-value (rank $i=1$) but becomes progressively more lenient for higher-ranked $p$-values. This justly accounts for the fact that out of $m$ tests, one would expect to see some small $p$-values by chance, and the threshold should adjust accordingly.\n\nWe now apply the BH procedure to the given data. We have $m=4$ hypotheses and desire to control the FDR at $q=0.05$. The assumption of mutual independence of test statistics is a condition under which the BH procedure is proven to control the FDR.\n\n1.  **Order the $p$-values and assign ranks.**\n    The given $p$-values are $p_1=0.001$, $p_2=0.02$, $p_3=0.04$, and $p_4=0.10$.
