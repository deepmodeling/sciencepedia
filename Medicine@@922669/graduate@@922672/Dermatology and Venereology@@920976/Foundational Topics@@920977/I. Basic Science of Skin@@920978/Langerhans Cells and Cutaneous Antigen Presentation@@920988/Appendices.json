Consider a minimal, well-mixed pericellular compartment surrounding a single LC in which binding between free antigen and free receptor is reversible and follows the law of mass action. Let $C(t)$ denote the concentration of free antigen in the pericellular space, $R(t)$ the surface density (or concentration) of free receptors on the LC, and $U(t)$ the surface density (or concentration) of receptor–antigen complexes. Assume $1:1$ stoichiometry for binding and that the total receptor supply is conserved on the timescale considered, so that receptor synthesis, recycling from endosomes, and downregulation are negligible during the observation window. Antigen diffusion maintains $C(t)$ approximately constant over the short timescale of binding, but $C(t)$ should be interpreted as the free antigen concentration, not total antigen.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action applied to the reversible reaction $A + R \\rightleftharpoons U$, where $A$ denotes free antigen, and using only the above assumptions and conservation of receptor, derive a minimal ordinary differential equation for $dU/dt$ and identify any algebraic constraints that close the system.

The setup is logically consistent.\n*   **Realism:** The model is a simplification (e.g., assumes a well-mixed environment) but represents a standard, scientifically valid approach to modeling the initial phase of cell-surface binding events.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard exercise in mathematical biology. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\n**1. Derivation of the ODE for $dU/dt$**\nThe reaction is given as $A + R \\rightleftharpoons U$. Let $k_{\\text{on}}$ be the forward (association) rate constant and $k_{\\text{off}}$ be the reverse (dissociation) rate constant.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of formation of the complex $U$ is proportional to the product of the concentrations (or surface densities for surface species) of the reactants.\n$$ \\text{Rate of association} = k_{\\text{on}} C(t) R(t) $$\nThe rate of dissociation of the complex $U$ is proportional to its own concentration.\n$$ \\text{Rate of dissociation} = k_{\\text{off}} U(t) $$\nThe net rate of change of $U(t)$ is the rate of formation minus the rate of dissociation:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}} C(t) R(t) - k_{\\text{off}} U(t) $$\n\n**2. Algebraic Constraint**\nThe problem states that the total receptor supply is conserved. Let this total surface density be $R_{\\text{tot}}$. Since each complex $U$ contains one receptor (due to $1:1$ stoichiometry), the total number of receptors is the sum of free receptors, $R(t)$, and bound receptors, $U(t)$.\n$$ R_{\\text{tot}} = R(t) + U(t) $$\nThis is the required algebraic constraint. We can express the free receptor density as:\n$$ R(t) = R_{\\text{tot}} - U(t) $$\nSubstituting this into the ODE yields a single equation in terms of $U(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}} C(t) (R_{\\text{tot}} - U(t)) - k_{\\text{off}} U(t) $$\n\n**3. Units of Kinetic Parameters**\nThe units of the terms in the ODE must be consistent. Let [Conc] be the units of $C(t)$ (e.g., mol/L), [SurfDens] be the units of $U(t)$ and $R(t)$ (e.g., molecules/m$^2$), and [Time] be the units of time (e.g., s). The units of $dU/dt$ are [SurfDens]/[Time].\n\n*   For the term $k_{\\text{off}} U(t)$:\n    $$ [\\text{Units of } k_{\\text{off}}] \\times [\\text{SurfDens}] = \\frac{[\\text{SurfDens}]}{[\\text{Time}]} $$\n    $$ \\Rightarrow [\\text{Units of } k_{\\text{off}}] = \\frac{1}{[\\text{Time}]} = [\\text{Time}]^{-1} $$\n*   For the term $k_{\\text{on}} C(t) R(t)$:\n    $$ [\\text{Units of } k_{\\text{on}}] \\times [\\text{Conc}] \\times [\\text{SurfDens}] = \\frac{[\\text{SurfDens}]}{[\\text{Time}]} $$\n    $$ \\Rightarrow [\\text{Units of } k_{\\text{on}}] = \\frac{1}{[\\text{Conc}] \\times [\\text{Time}]} = [\\text{Concentration}]^{-1} [\\text{Time}]^{-1} $$\n\n**4. Steady-State Solution**\nUnder the condition that $C(t) = C$ (a constant), the system reaches a steady state, denoted by $U^{\\ast}$, where $dU/dt = 0$.\n$$ 0 = k_{\\text{on}} C R^{\\ast} - k_{\\text{off}} U^{\\ast} $$\nwhere $R^{\\ast} = R_{\\text{tot}} - U^{\\ast}$. Substituting this in:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\text{on}} C (R_{\\text{tot}} - U^{\\ast}) - k_{\\text{off}} U^{\\ast} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} C R_{\\text{tot}} - k_{\\text{on}} C U^{\\ast} - k_{\\text{off}} U^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} C R_{\\text{tot}} = (k_{\\text{on}} C + k_{\\text{off}}) U^{\\ast} $$\nSolving for $U^{\\ast}$:\n$$ U^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} C R_{\\text{tot}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{on}} C} $$\nThis expression correctly shows that $U^{\\ast} \\to 0$ as $C \\to 0$, and $U^{\\ast} \\to R_{\\text{tot}}$ as $C \\to \\infty$, meaning the fraction of bound receptors saturates as antigen concentration increases. Thus, $0 \\le U^{\\ast} \\le R_{\\text{tot}}$ for $C \\ge 0$.\n\n**5. Biological Interpretation**\n*   **Equation:** The ODE describes the time evolution of surface-bound antigen.\n*   **$k_{\\text{on}} C R$:** This is the rate of antigen capture. It represents the formation of new antigen-receptor complexes on the LC surface, driven by the concentrations of free antigen ($C$) and free receptors ($R$).\n*   **$-k_{\\text{off}} U$:** This is the rate of antigen release. It represents the spontaneous dissociation of existing complexes, returning antigen to the pericellular space and freeing up the receptor.\n*   **$R = R_{\\text{tot}} - U$:** This represents the conservation of the total available receptor pool on the cell surface, partitioned between free and bound states.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** $\\,\\dfrac{dU}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,R - k_{\\text{off}}\\,U\\,$ with $\\,R = R_{\\text{tot}} - U\\,$. $k_{\\text{on}}$ has units of $\\,\\text{(concentration)}^{-1}\\,\\text{time}^{-1}\\,$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ has units of $\\,\\text{time}^{-1}\\,$. The interpretations of terms as association and dissociation are correct. The steady-state formula $\\,U^{\\ast} = \\dfrac{k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,R_{\\text{tot}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{on}}\\,C}\\,$ and its properties are also correct.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**. This option perfectly matches every aspect of the derivation from first principles.\n\n**B.** $\\,\\dfrac{dU}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,R_{\\text{tot}} + k_{\\text{off}}\\,U\\,$. The ODE is incorrect. It uses $R_{\\text{tot}}$ instead of the free receptor concentration $R(t)$, which violates the law of mass action. The sign of the $k_{\\text{off}}$ term is positive, implying that dissociation creates complexes, which is physically impossible and leads to unbounded growth. The units are stated to be $\\text{time}^{-1}$ for both constants, which is dimensionally inconsistent for $k_{\\text{on}}$. The interpretation of the second term as \"intracellular processing\" contradicts the problem statement defining $U$ as a surface complex.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** $\\,\\dfrac{dU}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,(R_{\\text{tot}} - U) - k_{\\text{off}}\\,U\\,$. The form of the ODE is correct. However, the units given are $k_{\\text{on}}$ in $\\text{time}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ in $\\text{(concentration)}^{-1}\\,\\text{time}^{-1}$. This is the reverse of the correctly derived units, making the equation dimensionally inconsistent. The interpretation that dissociation is limited by antigen availability is nonsensical; dissociation is a first-order decay process of the complex $U$.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** $\\,\\dfrac{dU}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,R - k_{\\text{off}}\\,U\\,$ with $\\,R = R_{\\text{tot}} + U\\,$. The algebraic constraint is incorrect. It violates the conservation of receptors as stated in the problem. It implies that binding a ligand *creates* a free receptor, which is physically nonsensical. The claim that both rate constants have units of $\\text{(concentration)}^{-1}\\,\\text{time}^{-1}$ is false for $k_{\\text{off}}$. The interpretation of the negative term as internalization contradicts the problem's premise of a reversible reaction ($A+R \\rightleftharpoons U$).\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.** $\\,\\dfrac{dU}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,R - k_{\\text{off}}\\,U\\,$ with $\\,R = R_{\\text{tot}} - U\\,$. The mathematical components (ODE, constraint, units, steady state) are correctly stated. However, the biological interpretation is flawed. It redefines $U$ as \"internalized antigen\" and the negative term as \"lysosomal degradation\". The problem explicitly defines $U$ as the *surface density* of receptor-antigen complexes and the reaction as reversible, meaning the negative term must represent *dissociation* that returns free antigen and receptor, not degradation of an internalized species. This interpretation contradicts the setup.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A provides the correct mathematical model, correct units, correct steady-state solution, and a biological interpretation that is fully consistent with the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4451104"}, {"introduction": "Following antigen capture, the LC matures and embarks on a crucial journey from the epidermis to a regional lymph node, where it can initiate an adaptive immune response.

Assume the following typical lymph node conditions at steady state after a localized cutaneous antigen exposure: a single naive antigen-specific T cell makes $r=4$ short contacts per minute with APCs, the observation window is $T=2$ hours, the fraction of those contacts that are specifically with antigen-bearing LCs is $f=0.05$, and the per-contact probability that a productive signaling “quantum” is delivered (sufficient to count toward activation in an additive manner) is small and given by the parameter $\\beta=0.02$.

Each of the $N$ contacts is an independent trial where a productive signaling quantum may be delivered with probability $\\beta$. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of productive signaling quanta received in $N$ trials.
