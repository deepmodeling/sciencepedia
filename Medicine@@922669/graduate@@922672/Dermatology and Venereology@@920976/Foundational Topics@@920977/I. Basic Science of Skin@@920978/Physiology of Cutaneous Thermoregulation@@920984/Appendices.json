In the context of whole-body heat exchange, define the following rates: metabolic energy production $M$ (chemical energy liberated by metabolism), external mechanical work $W$ (useful work performed on the environment), convective heat transfer $C$, radiative heat transfer $R$, evaporative heat loss $E$ (including both cutaneous sweat evaporation and respiratory evaporation), and thermal energy storage in body tissues $S$ (the rate of change of the body's internal thermal energy).

The rate form of the FLT states that the rate of change of the total internal energy of a system, $\\frac{dU}{dt}$, is equal to the net rate of heat transfer into the system, $\\dot{Q}$, minus the rate of work done by the system on its surroundings, $\\dot{W}_{by}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\dot{Q} - \\dot{W}_{by}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the human subject is to be treated as this system. The total internal energy, $U$, of the body comprises multiple forms. For this problem, we consider its two main components: chemical energy, $U_{chem}$, and thermal energy, $U_{therm}$. Other forms of energy, such as macroscopic potential and kinetic energy, are assumed to be constant and their changes are neglected.\n$$\nU = U_{chem} + U_{therm}\n$$\nThe rate of change of total internal energy is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\frac{dU_{chem}}{dt} + \\frac{dU_{therm}}{dt}\n$$\nWe now relate the terms provided in the problem statement to this framework.\nThe metabolic energy production rate, $M$, is defined as the rate at which chemical energy is liberated. This means the body's store of chemical energy is depleted at the rate $M$. Thus, the rate of change of chemical energy is negative.\n$$\n\\frac{dU_{chem}}{dt} = -M\n$$\nThe rate of thermal energy storage in body tissues, $S$, is explicitly defined as the rate of change of the body's internal thermal energy.\n$$\n\\frac{dU_{therm}}{dt} = S\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for the rate of change of total internal energy gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = S - M\n$$\nNext, we analyze the heat and work terms of the FLT. The rate of work done by the system, $\\dot{W}_{by}$, corresponds to the external mechanical work, $W$.\n$$\n\\dot{W}_{by} = W\n$$\nThe net rate of heat transfer into the system, $\\dot{Q}$, is the sum of all thermal exchanges with the environment. The problem defines rates for convective heat transfer ($C$), radiative heat transfer ($R$), and evaporative heat loss ($E$). The standard convention in thermophysiology, supported by the phrasing \"evaporative heat loss\", is to define these terms as positive for heat loss *from* the body. Therefore, the heat transfer *into* the system is the negative sum of these loss terms.\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = -(C + R + E)\n$$\nWe can now substitute all these components back into the original FLT equation:\n$$\nS - M = -(C + R + E) - W\n$$\nThis equation directly relates all the specified quantities. To obtain the whole-body energy balance in its conventional form, we rearrange the equation to solve for $S$:\n$$\nS = M - W - (C + R) - E\n$$\nThis is the constructed whole-body energy balance equation. It states that the net energy generated by the body (metabolic production minus external work) is balanced by the sum of all modes of heat loss and the rate of energy storage.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the value of $S$ for the given conditions.\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\nMetabolic energy production, $M = 100\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nExternal mechanical work, $W = 0\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nCombined convective and radiative heat exchange, $C+R = 60\\,\\mathrm{W}$.

Consider a small, thermally homogeneous patch of glabrous skin perfused by $N$ identical, straight arterioles of initial radius $r_0$ and fixed length $L$, each supplying capillary networks in parallel. During active vasodilation, smooth muscle relaxation increases arteriole radius to $r_1 = 1.2\\,r_0$. Assume the following biophysical conditions hold over the short timescale of interest: blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid of constant dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, flow is steady and laminar, the perfusion pressure drop $\\Delta P$ from proximal arteriole to venule remains constant, vessel length $L$ is unchanged, and $N$ does not change.

The rate of heat dissipation, $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat}}$, for a single arteriole is determined by the mass flow rate of blood, $\\dot{m}$, the specific heat capacity of blood, $c_p$, and the arteriovenous temperature difference, $\\Delta T$.

The problem specifies that the flow is steady and laminar, and blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid. Under these conditions, the flow in a rigid cylindrical tube is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. This equation relates the volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}$ to the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across the tube, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid $\\mu$, the tube length $L$, and its radius $r$:\n$$ \\dot{V} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L} r^4 $$\nThe problem states that the perfusion pressure drop $\\Delta P$, the viscosity $\\mu$, and the vessel length $L$ remain constant.
