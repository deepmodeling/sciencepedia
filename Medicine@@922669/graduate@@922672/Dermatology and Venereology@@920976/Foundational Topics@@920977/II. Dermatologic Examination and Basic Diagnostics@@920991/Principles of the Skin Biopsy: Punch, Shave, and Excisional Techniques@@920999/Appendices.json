It is a straightforward application of dimensional analysis and proportionality, relevant to the specified clinical field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the maximum safe volumes of a $1\\%$ lidocaine solution for a $70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ patient under two conditions: without and with epinephrine.\n\nLet $m_p$ be the mass of the patient, given as $m_p = 70 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nLet $D_{plain}$ be the maximum safe dose of plain lidocaine, given as $D_{plain} = 4.5 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\nLet $D_{epi}$ be the maximum safe dose of lidocaine with epinephrine, given as $D_{epi} = 7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total maximum mass of lidocaine, $M_{max}$, that can be administered to the patient for each scenario.\nThe total maximum mass is the product of the patient's mass and the specific dose per unit mass.\n\nFor scenario (a), plain lidocaine:\n$$M_{max, plain} = m_p \\times D_{plain}$$\n$$M_{max, plain} = 70 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 4.5 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 315 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nFor scenario (b), lidocaine with epinephrine:\n$$M_{max, epi} = m_p \\times D_{epi}$$\n$$M_{max, epi} = 70 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 7 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 490 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the concentration of the $1\\%$ lidocaine solution in units that are compatible with our calculated mass, i.e., $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\nThe definition provided is that a $1\\%$ solution corresponds to $1$ gram of solute per $100$ milliliters of solution. Let this concentration be $C$.\n$$C = \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{g}}{100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}}$$\nTo convert this to $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$, we use the conversion factor $1 \\ \\mathrm{g} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n$$C = \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{g}}{100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}} = 10 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\nSo, the $1\\%$ lidocaine solution contains $10$ milligrams of lidocaine per milliliter of solution.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum volume, $V_{max}$, that can be administered by dividing the total maximum mass of lidocaine by the concentration of the solution. The general formula is:\n$$V_{max} = \\frac{M_{max}}{C}$$\n\nApplying this formula to our two scenarios:\n\n(a) Maximum volume of plain lidocaine ($V_{plain}$):\n$$V_{plain} = \\frac{M_{max, plain}}{C} = \\frac{315 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{10 \\ \\mathrm{mg/mL}} = 31.5 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n(b) Maximum volume of lidocaine with epinephrine ($V_{epi}$):\n$$V_{epi} = \\frac{M_{max, epi}}{C} = \\frac{490 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{10 \\ \\mathrm{mg/mL}} = 49.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answers to be rounded to three significant figures.\nFor the plain lidocaine, the value is $31.5 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$, which already has three significant figures.\nFor the lidocaine with epinephrine, the value is $49.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$. The trailing zero is significant and is necessary to meet the three-significant-figure requirement.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of volumes $(V_{plain}, V_{epi})$.\nTherefore, the maximum safe volumes are $31.5$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ for plain lidocaine and $49.0$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ for lidocaine with epinephrine.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n31.5  49.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4487418"}, {"introduction": "An excellent surgical outcome is the result of meticulous planning. For an excisional biopsy, this involves designing the excision to ensure complete removal of the lesion while enabling a tension-free closure that minimizes scarring.

The use of a fusiform ellipse with a specified length-to-width ratio (commonly $3:1$ or $4:1$) to excise a skin lesion, including a specific margin, is a standard and fundamental technique in dermatologic surgery.

The distance between these two points is, by definition, the total length of the ellipse, $L$.\n\nTherefore, the final linear wound length is equal to $L$.\n$$\\text{Wound Length} = L = 36 \\text{ mm}$$\nThis assumption is standard in the idealized model of a linear closure for a fusiform excision, where the two sides of the ellipse are brought together along the major axis.\n\nThe three computed values, in the required order $\\{W, L, \\text{wound length}\\}$, are $\\{12 \\text{ mm}, 36 \\text{ mm}, 36 \\text{ mm}\\}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 12  36  36 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4487484"}, {"introduction": "Beyond mastering individual techniques, the hallmark of an expert is the ability to select the right tool for the right job. This final practice moves from procedural calculation to high-level clinical reasoning, challenging you to construct a decision-making algorithm for choosing a biopsy technique. By weighing the diagnostic requirements against the risks and benefits of shave, punch, and excisional biopsies for different clinical scenarios, you will develop the strategic thinking essential for optimizing patient outcomes [@problem_id:4487476].", "problem": "A dermatology fellow is tasked with formalizing a clinic decision algorithm for selecting skin biopsy techniques that optimizes histologic yield while minimizing patient risk across three common categories of clinical indications: suspected melanoma, inflammatory dermatoses, and benign raised keratoses. The fellow proposes to base the algorithm on first principles of histologic adequacy and procedural risk, defined as follows:\n\n- Histologic adequacy is the probability of capturing the diagnostic architecture required for disease confirmation and staging, including the deepest relevant anatomic level. For melanocytic neoplasia suspicious for melanoma, adequacy requires intact architecture with the ability to measure Breslow thickness (BT), defined as the vertical distance (in $\\mathrm{mm}$) from the top of the granular layer (or from the ulcer base if present) to the deepest malignant cell. For inflammatory dermatoses, adequacy requires a representative sample of the epidermis, dermal-epidermal junction, dermis, and often superficial subcutis to preserve pattern recognition on Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining. For benign raised keratoses such as seborrheic keratosis, adequacy primarily requires capture of epidermal and superficial adnexal architecture.\n- Procedural risk includes the probability of transecting the lesion base (leading to BT underestimation in melanoma), sampling error (misclassification due to unrepresentative tissue), bleeding, infection, scarring, and damage to adjacent structures. Let $P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$ denote the probability of transection, $P_{\\mathrm{sample}}$ denote the probability of sampling error, and let qualitative risk scores $B$, $I$, $S$ represent bleeding, infection, and scarring, respectively, on a relative scale.\n\nThe fellow considers typical technique characteristics:\n- Shave biopsy generally samples epidermis and superficial dermis; “saucerization” can extend into mid-dermis but frequently risks base transection in infiltrative processes.\n- Punch biopsy (typical diameter $p \\in [3,6]\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) yields full-thickness cores through dermis and often to superficial subcutis, preserving vertical architecture but only from a limited field.\n- Excisional biopsy (elliptical or fusiform) removes the entire visible lesion with a narrow lateral margin (commonly $1$–$3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), oriented along Relaxed Skin Tension Lines (RSTL), and extends through subcutis, maximizing capture of lateral and deep architecture.\n\nGiven a triage function that assigns each lesion to one of three categories $C \\in \\{\\text{suspicious melanocytic}, \\text{inflammatory}, \\text{benign raised keratosis}\\}$ based on clinical evaluation (e.g., Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, Evolution (ABCDE) for melanocytic lesions; morphology and distribution for inflammatory disease; “stuck-on” appearance for keratoses), which of the following decision algorithms best adheres to first principles to maximize histologic adequacy and minimize risk?\n\nA. If $C=\\text{suspicious melanocytic}$, perform excisional biopsy with an oriented ellipse along RSTL, narrow lateral margins of $1$–$3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and depth to subcutis to avoid $P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$ and preserve BT; if $C=\\text{inflammatory}$, perform punch biopsy of $p=4$–$6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ at the advancing edge of an active, untreated lesion, down to superficial subcutis to preserve pattern; if $C=\\text{benign raised keratosis}$, perform a superficial shave that samples epidermis and papillary dermis to minimize $S$ and $B$ while maintaining adequacy for keratinocytic lesions.\n\nB. If $C=\\text{suspicious melanocytic}$, perform deep saucerization shave to mid-dermis to reduce $S$; if $C=\\text{inflammatory}$, perform shave of the most elevated area to avoid bleeding; if $C=\\text{benign raised keratosis}$, perform punch biopsy to ensure full-thickness sampling.\n\nC.

Can extend to mid-dermis (saucerization) but with a high risk of base transection ($P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$).\n    - **Punch Biopsy:** Diameter $p \\in [3, 6]\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Provides a full-thickness core to the superficial subcutis.\n    - **Excisional Biopsy:** Removes the entire lesion with a $1$–$3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ lateral margin, extending to the subcutis. Usually oriented along Relaxed Skin Tension Lines (RSTL).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental and established principles of diagnostic dermatology and dermatologic surgery. The definitions of histologic adequacy for melanoma (requiring Breslow depth), inflammatory disease (requiring pattern recognition), and benign lesions are standard in dermatopathology. The described risks ($P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$, $P_{\\mathrm{sample}}$, scarring) and the characteristics of the three biopsy techniques are accurate representations of clinical practice.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear objective (optimize adequacy, minimize risk) and a set of defined constraints and principles. It asks to identify the best algorithm among a set of options, which is a solvable and well-defined task.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and precise. It establishes a formal framework for evaluation based on defined terms like BT, $P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$, and RSTL.\n\nAll criteria for a valid problem are met. No flaws such as scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or incompleteness are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Algorithm from First Principles\n\nA correct algorithm must tailor the biopsy technique to the specific requirements of each clinical category ($C$).\n\n1.  **For $C = \\text{suspicious melanocytic}$:**\n    - **Adequacy Principle:** The highest priority is to enable an accurate measurement of Breslow thickness (BT). This requires obtaining the entire vertical dimension of the tumor without transecting its base. Transection ($P_{\\mathrm{transect}} > 0$) leads to underestimation of BT, which can result in incorrect staging and undertreatment of melanoma, a potentially fatal error. Therefore, minimizing $P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$ is the paramount concern. Minimizing sampling error ($P_{\\mathrm{sample}}$) is also critical, as a partial biopsy might miss the invasive component of a lesion.\n    - **Technique Selection:**\n        - A shave biopsy, even a deep one, carries an unacceptably high risk of transecting the base of an invasive melanoma. It is therefore contraindicated when melanoma is a primary suspicion.\n        - A punch biopsy provides full thickness but is narrow. If the lesion is wider than the punch diameter, it can miss the deepest part of the invasion ($P_{\\mathrm{sample}}$) or laterally transect the lesion.\n        - An **excisional biopsy** is the ideal technique. By removing the entire lesion with a narrow $1$–$3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ margin and extending into the subcutaneous fat, it ensures the entire tumor is available for analysis. This virtually eliminates both $P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{sample}}$, maximizing diagnostic adequacy. Orienting the excision along RSTL helps to minimize the resultant scar ($S$).\n\n2.  **For $C = \\text{inflammatory}$:**\n    - **Adequacy Principle:** The diagnosis of inflammatory dermatoses often depends on recognizing the architectural \"pattern\" of inflammation (e.g., lichenoid, perivascular, nodular) and its relationship to the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis. Therefore, a full-thickness sample that preserves this vertical architecture is required.\n    - **Technique Selection:**\n        - A shave biopsy is inadequate as it only samples the superficial portion of the skin, missing crucial information in the mid-dermis, deep dermis, and subcutis. This would lead to a high rate of non-diagnostic findings.\n        - An excisional biopsy would provide an adequate sample, but it is generally excessive. It creates a large defect and linear scar ($S$) for a condition that can be diagnosed with a smaller sample.\n        - A **punch biopsy** is the ideal technique. It provides a full-thickness core of tissue, including epidermis, dermis, and superficial subcutis, perfectly preserving the vertical architecture needed for pattern recognition. A diameter of $p=4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is standard, providing sufficient tissue for the pathologist while leaving a small, cosmetically acceptable scar.\n\n3.  **For $C = \\text{benign raised keratosis}$:**\n    - **Adequacy Principle:** These lesions (like seborrheic keratosis) are typically epidermal or very superficial. Histologic confirmation is needed to rule out mimics (like nodular melanoma), but this only requires evaluation of the epidermis and papillary dermis. A deep sample is unnecessary.\n    - **Risk Principle:** Since the lesion is benign, minimizing procedural morbidity—scarring ($S$) and bleeding ($B$)—is the primary goal.\n    - **Technique Selection:**\n        - A **superficial shave biopsy** is the ideal technique. It removes the lesion for histologic analysis while creating only a superficial wound that heals with minimal scarring, often without sutures.\n        - A punch biopsy or an excisional biopsy would be inappropriate. Both are full-thickness procedures that would create an unnecessarily deep defect, requiring sutures and leaving a more significant scar ($S$) for a superficial, benign condition. This represents procedural overkill.\n\n### Evaluation of Provided Options\n\n**A. If $C=\\text{suspicious melanocytic}$, perform excisional biopsy with an oriented ellipse along RSTL, narrow lateral margins of $1$–$3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and depth to subcutis to avoid $P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$ and preserve BT; if $C=\\text{inflammatory}$, perform punch biopsy of $p=4$–$6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ at the advancing edge of an active, untreated lesion, down to superficial subcutis to preserve pattern; if $C=\\text{benign raised keratosis}$, perform a superficial shave that samples epidermis and papillary dermis to minimize $S$ and $B$ while maintaining adequacy for keratinocytic lesions.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This algorithm perfectly matches the optimal strategy derived from first principles for all three categories.\n    - For suspicious melanoma, it correctly mandates excisional biopsy, specifying the correct technique (margins, depth, orientation) to minimize $P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$ and maximize diagnostic yield for BT.\n    - For inflammatory disease, it correctly chooses punch biopsy, specifying the correct parameters (size, location, depth) to ensure pattern preservation and minimize $P_{\\mathrm{sample}}$.\n    - For benign keratosis, it correctly selects superficial shave biopsy to ensure adequacy while minimizing scarring ($S$) and bleeding ($B$).\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. If $C=\\text{suspicious melanocytic}$, perform deep saucerization shave to mid-dermis to reduce $S$; if $C=\\text{inflammatory}$, perform shave of the most elevated area to avoid bleeding; if $C=\\text{benign raised keratosis}$, perform punch biopsy to ensure full-thickness sampling.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This algorithm is incorrect and contradicts the principles for every category.\n    - For suspicious melanoma, suggesting a shave biopsy is dangerous as it prioritizes a smaller scar ($S$) over the critical need to avoid $P_{\\mathrm{transect}}$ and accurately stage a potential cancer.\n    - For inflammatory disease, a shave biopsy is histologically inadequate.\n    - For a benign keratosis, a punch biopsy is procedural overkill that unnecessarily increases scarring ($S$).\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. If the lesion diameter is $d \\leq 4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ regardless of $C$, perform punch biopsy; otherwise perform shave biopsy for all categories to minimize $S$; reserve excision only for lesions with $d \\geq 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ or those on the back.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This algorithm's logic is fundamentally flawed. It bases decisions primarily on size ($d$) rather than the clinical indication ($C$), which dictates the histologic requirements. A shave biopsy for a suspected melanoma or an inflammatory process is inappropriate regardless of size. The rules for excision are arbitrary and not based on the principle of adequacy.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Perform excisional biopsy with $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ margins and through subcutis for all categories to eliminate $P_{\\mathrm{sample}}$, and orient along RSTL only when $d \\geq 8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This \"one-size-fits-all\" approach is deeply flawed.\n    - While an excisional biopsy provides an adequate sample, performing it for all lesions is inappropriate. It represents significant overtreatment for benign keratoses and most inflammatory diseases, causing unnecessary scarring ($S$) and morbidity. This violates the principle of minimizing risk.\n    - The specified $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ margin is a therapeutic margin for a confirmed thin melanoma, not a diagnostic biopsy margin, which is typically $1$–$3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - The rule for RSTL orientation is arbitrary; orientation along RSTL is always preferred to minimize scarring, regardless of lesion size.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the problem's stated principles, option A is the only algorithm that correctly balances histologic adequacy and procedural risk across all three clinical scenarios.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4487476"}]}
