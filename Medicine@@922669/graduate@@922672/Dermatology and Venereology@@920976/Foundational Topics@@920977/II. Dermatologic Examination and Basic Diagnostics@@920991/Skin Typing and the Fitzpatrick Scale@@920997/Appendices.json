This exercise bridges the gap between qualitative phenotyping and quantitative analysis by tasking you with calculating the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) from objective colorimetric data.

Starting from the geometric interpretation of an angle of a vector in a Cartesian plane and the radian-to-degree conversion, derive an analytic expression for ITA in terms of $L^*$ and $b^*$, compute its value for the given measurements, and then use the following empirically established thresholds to assign a colorimetric category: very light if ITA > 55, light if ITA in [41, 55], intermediate if ITA in [28, 41], tan if ITA in [10, 28], brown if ITA in [-30, 10], dark if ITA  -30.

The final reported answer should be only the ITA value.", "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. It is based on established concepts in colorimetry (CIE $L^*a^*b^*$ space) and dermatology (Individual Typology Angle, Fitzpatrick scale). The data provided are consistent and plausible. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe Individual Typology Angle (ITA) is defined geometrically in a Cartesian plane where the axes correspond to the $b^*$ (yellowness-blueness) and $L^*$ (lightness) color coordinates. The problem specifies that the angle is determined relative to a reference origin centered at $L^* = 50$ on the $L^*$ axis. In the $(b^*, L^*)$ coordinate plane, this origin point $O$ has coordinates $(0, 50)$.\n\nLet the measured skin color point be $P$ with coordinates $(b^*, L^*)$. The vector $\\vec{v}$ from the reference origin $O$ to the point $P$ is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{v} = P - O = (b^*, L^*) - (0, 50) = (b^*, L^*-50)\n$$\nThe ITA is the angle this vector makes. The geometric definition implies the angle is measured from the positive $b^*$ axis towards the $L^*$ axis. In a standard Cartesian coordinate system, if we let the horizontal axis be $x=b^*$ and the vertical axis be $y=L^*-50$, the angle $\\theta$ of the vector $(x, y)$ with respect to the positive $x$-axis is given by the arctangent function:\n$$\n\\text{ITA}_{\\text{rad}} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\text{vertical component}}{\\text{horizontal component}}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{L^*-50}{b^*}\\right)\n$$\nThis gives the angle in radians. The problem requires the angle in degrees. The conversion from radians to degrees is multiplication by the factor $\\frac{180}{\\pi}$. Therefore, the analytical expression for the ITA in degrees is:\n$$\n\\text{ITA} = \\left(\\frac{180}{\\pi}\\right) \\arctan\\left(\\frac{L^*-50}{b^*}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the value of ITA for the given measurements: $L^* = 68$ and $b^* = 14$. Substituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\text{ITA} = \\left(\\frac{180}{\\pi}\\right) \\arctan\\left(\\frac{68-50}{14}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ITA} = \\left(\\frac{180}{\\pi}\\right) \\arctan\\left(\\frac{18}{14}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ITA} = \\left(\\frac{180}{\\pi}\\right) \\arctan\\left(\\frac{9}{7}\\right)\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\arctan\\left(\\frac{9}{7}\\right) \\approx 0.90978 \\text{ radians}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ITA} \\approx \\left(\\frac{180}{\\pi}\\right) \\times 0.90978 \\approx 52.125016\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed, we get:\n$$\n\\text{ITA} \\approx 52.13\n$$\nNext, we use the provided thresholds to assign a colorimetric category. The calculated value is $\\text{ITA} \\approx 52.13$. We check the intervals:\n- Very light: $\\text{ITA} > 55$\n- Light: $\\text{ITA} \\in [41, 55]$\n- Intermediate: $\\text{ITA} \\in [28, 41]$\n- Tan: $\\text{ITA} \\in [10, 28]$\n- Brown: $\\text{ITA} \\in [-30, 10]$\n- Dark: $\\text{ITA}  -30$\nSince $41 \\le 52.13 \\le 55$, the skin colorimetric category is \"light\".\n\nFinally, we discuss the correspondence of this category to the Fitzpatrick phototypes. The Fitzpatrick scale classifies skin based on its response to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, specifically the tendency to burn versus tan. It ranges from Type I (always burns, never tans) to Type VI (never burns, deeply pigmented). The ITA, in contrast, is an objective, colorimetric measure of constitutive (baseline) skin pigmentation. While the two scales measure different properties, they are highly correlated.\n\nThe \"light\" colorimetric category, corresponding to an ITA of $52.13$, is characteristic of fair-skinned individuals. This typically aligns with Fitzpatrick phototypes II and III.\n- **Fitzpatrick Type I** skin is extremely fair and sensitive, usually corresponding to the \"very light\" category with $\\text{ITA} > 55$.\n- **Fitzpatrick Type II** skin burns easily and tans minimally.\n- **Fitzpatrick Type III** skin burns moderately and tans gradually.\nBoth Type II and Type III represent a transition from highly sun-sensitive to more sun-resistant skin and are commonly found in Caucasian populations, whose skin color often falls within the \"light\" ITA range.\n- **Fitzpatrick Types IV-VI** have progressively darker pigmentation and greater resistance to sun burning, corresponding to lower ITA values in the \"intermediate\", \"tan\", \"brown\", and \"dark\" categories.\n\nTherefore, a subject with an ITA of $52.13$ is most plausibly classified as Fitzpatrick phototype II or III. It is crucial to recognize that this is a strong correlation, not a definitive equivalence, as ITA quantifies color while the Fitzpatrick scale quantifies photoreactivity.\n\nThe final requested answer is only the numerical value of the ITA.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{52.13}\n$$", "id": "4492009"}, {"introduction": "This practice provides a biophysical basis for the Fitzpatrick scale's correlation with sun sensitivity, moving from clinical observation to mechanistic understanding.

The number of photons is proportional to the photon fluence rate at the depth $L$, which is $I(L)$. Therefore, we can write $P(\\phi)$ as being proportional to $I(L, \\phi)$:\n$$P(\\phi) = k \\cdot I(L, \\phi)$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on factors such as the DNA absorption cross-section and the fixed exposure time, but not on $\\phi$.

We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in two stages as requested.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum effective protection factor required to avoid sunburn. Sunburn (erythema) occurs when the erythemally weighted radiant exposure delivered to the skin, $H_{\\mathrm{del}}$, exceeds the minimal erythema dose, $H_{\\mathrm{MED}}$. To prevent this, we require:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{del}} \\le H_{\\mathrm{MED}} $$\nThe delivered dose is the product of the predicted incident exposure, $H_{\\mathrm{pred}}$, and the erythemally weighted transmittance, $T$, of the sunscreen film.\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{del}} = T \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{pred}} $$\nCombining these, the condition to prevent erythema becomes:\n$$ T \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{pred}} \\le H_{\\mathrm{MED}} \\implies T \\le \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{MED}}}{H_{\\mathrm{pred}}} $$\nThe effective sun protection factor at a given application thickness, which we denote as $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the factor by which the sunscreen reduces the erythemally effective dose. This is fundamentally the reciprocal of the transmittance.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1}{T} $$\nThe definition of SPF provided in the problem, $S = \\frac{\\text{MED on protected skin}}{\\text{MED on unprotected skin}}$, rigorously leads to this same conclusion. The MED on protected skin is the incident dose that results in a delivered dose equal to the MED on unprotected skin ($H_{\\mathrm{MED}}$). Thus, $\\text{MED}_{\\mathrm{prot}} \\cdot T = H_{\\mathrm{MED}}$, which means $\\text{MED}_{\\mathrm{prot}} = H_{\\mathrm{MED}}/T$. The ratio becomes $S = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{MED}}/T}{H_{\\mathrm{MED}}} = 1/T$.\n\nSubstituting $S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1/T$ into the inequality for transmittance gives the requirement for the effective SPF:\n$$ \\frac{1}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\le \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{MED}}}{H_{\\mathrm{pred}}} \\implies S_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ge \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{pred}}}{H_{\\mathrm{MED}}} $$\nThe minimum required effective protection factor, $S_{\\mathrm{req}}$, is therefore the ratio of the predicted exposure to the MED.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{req}} = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{pred}}}{H_{\\mathrm{MED}}} = \\frac{900 \\, \\mathrm{mJ/cm^2}}{300 \\, \\mathrm{mJ/cm^2}} = 3 $$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the minimum labeled SPF, $S_{\\mathrm{label,min}}$, that ensures this level of protection under real-world application conditions.\nThe transmittance $T$ for a film of mass-per-area $m$ is given by the Beer–Lambert law:\n$$ T(m) = \\exp(-k \\cdot m) $$\nwhere $k$ is an effective absorption coefficient characteristic of the sunscreen formulation. The effective SPF at a thickness $m$ is then:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(m) = \\frac{1}{T(m)} = \\exp(k \\cdot m) $$\nThe labeled SPF, $S_{\\mathrm{label}}$, is the effective SPF measured at the standard thickness $m_0 = 2 \\, \\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{label}} = S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(m_0) = \\exp(k \\cdot m_0) $$\nThis equation connects the intrinsic property $k$ to the labeled SPF. We can solve for $k$:\n$$ \\ln(S_{\\mathrm{label}}) = k \\cdot m_0 \\implies k = \\frac{\\ln(S_{\\mathrm{label}})}{m_0} $$\nThe problem requires that protection be guaranteed with at least $95\\%$ probability. This is interpreted as requiring the effective SPF to be sufficient ($S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(m) \\ge S_{\\mathrm{req}}$) for all application masses $m$ that occur with $95\\%$ probability, i.e., for all $m \\ge m_{0.05}$.\nThe function $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(m) = \\exp(k \\cdot m)$ is strictly increasing with $m$ (since $k  0$ for any effective sunscreen). Therefore, if the condition $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(m) \\ge S_{\\mathrm{req}}$ is satisfied at the lowest mass in this range, $m = m_{0.05}$, it will be satisfied for all $m  m_{0.05}$. The critical condition simplifies to:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(m_{0.05}) \\ge S_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nTo find the minimum labeled SPF, $S_{\\mathrm{label,min}}$, that meets this requirement, we set the condition to equality:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(m_{0.05}) = S_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for effective SPF:\n$$ \\exp(k \\cdot m_{0.05}) = S_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $k$ in terms of the (minimum) labeled SPF we wish to find:\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\ln(S_{\\mathrm{label,min}})}{m_0}\\right) \\cdot m_{0.05}\\right) = S_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(a \\ln b) = b^a$, we can rewrite the left side:\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\ln(S_{\\mathrm{label,min}}) \\cdot \\frac{m_{0.05}}{m_0}\\right) = (S_{\\mathrm{label,min}})^{\\frac{m_{0.05}}{m_0}} $$\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ (S_{\\mathrm{label,min}})^{\\frac{m_{0.05}}{m_0}} = S_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nTo solve for $S_{\\mathrm{label,min}}$, we raise both sides to the reciprocal power, $\\frac{m_0}{m_{0.05}}$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{label,min}} = (S_{\\mathrm{req}})^{\\frac{m_0}{m_{0.05}}} $$\nFinally, we substitute the known values for $S_{\\mathrm{req}}$ and $m_0$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{req}} = 3 $$\n$$ m_0 = 2 \\, \\mathrm{mg/cm^2} $$\nThe resulting expression for $S_{\\mathrm{label,min}}$ as a function of $m_{0.05}$ (where $m_{0.05}$ is in units of $\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$) is:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{label,min}} = 3^{\\frac{2}{m_{0.05}}} $$\nThis is the final analytical expression required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3^{\\frac{2}{m_{0.05}}}}$$", "id": "4491932"}]}
