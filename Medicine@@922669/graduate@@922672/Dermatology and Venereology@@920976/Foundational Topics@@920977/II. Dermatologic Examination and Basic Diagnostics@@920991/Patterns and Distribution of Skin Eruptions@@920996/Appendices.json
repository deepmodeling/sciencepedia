It is a well-defined exercise in applying Bayesian inference to a clinical diagnostic scenario. A solution will be provided.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the framework of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. Let us define the following events:\n-   $Z$: The event that a patient has herpes zoster.\n-   $Z^c$: The event that a patient has a non-zoster vesicular eruption (the complement of $Z$).\n-   $C$: The event that a patient is immunocompetent.\n-   $C^c$: The event that a patient is immunocompromised (the complement of $C$).\n-   $D$: The event that a unilateral dermatomal vesicular distribution is observed.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The proportion of immunocompromised patients is $P(C^c) = 0.20$.\n2.  The proportion of immunocompetent patients is therefore $P(C) = 1 - P(C^c) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n3.  The pre-test probability of zoster in the immunocompetent stratum is $P(Z|C) = 0.35$.\n4.  The pre-test probability of zoster in the immunocompromised stratum is $P(Z|C^c) = 0.70$.\n5.  The probability of a dermatomal distribution given zoster is $P(D|Z) = 0.92$.\n6.  The probability of a dermatomal distribution given non-zoster is $P(D|Z^c) = 0.05$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the post-test probability of herpes zoster given the observation of a unilateral dermatomal eruption, which is $P(Z|D)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, this probability is given by:\n$$\nP(Z|D) = \\frac{P(D|Z) P(Z)}{P(D)}\n$$\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to calculate the overall pre-test probability of herpes zoster, $P(Z)$, and the overall probability of observing a dermatomal distribution, $P(D)$, in the entire clinic population.\n\nWe can calculate $P(Z)$ using the law of total probability, conditioning on the patient's immune status:\n$$\nP(Z) = P(Z|C) P(C) + P(Z|C^c) P(C^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nP(Z) = (0.35)(0.80) + (0.70)(0.20) = 0.28 + 0.14 = 0.42\n$$\nSo, the overall pre-test probability of herpes zoster in this clinic is $0.42$. The probability of a non-zoster eruption is $P(Z^c) = 1 - P(Z) = 1 - 0.42 = 0.58$.\n\nNext, we calculate the overall probability of observing a dermatomal distribution, $P(D)$, again using the law of total probability, this time conditioning on whether the patient has zoster or not:\n$$\nP(D) = P(D|Z) P(Z) + P(D|Z^c) P(Z^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the known and calculated values:\n$$\nP(D) = (0.92)(0.42) + (0.05)(0.58)\n$$\n$$\nP(D) = 0.3864 + 0.029 = 0.4154\n$$\nSo, the overall probability of any patient presenting with a unilateral dermatomal eruption is $0.4154$.\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate our target probability, $P(Z|D)$, using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(Z|D) = \\frac{P(D|Z) P(Z)}{P(D)} = \\frac{(0.92)(0.42)}{0.4154} = \\frac{0.3864}{0.4154}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nP(Z|D) \\approx 0.9301877708233028\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $3$, $0$, and $1$. The fifth significant figure is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\nP(Z|D) \\approx 0.9302\n$$\nThis is the post-test probability of herpes zoster in a patient from this clinic population after observing a unilateral dermatomal vesicular eruption.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9302}$$", "id": "4469683"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying a pattern in a single patient, a key skill is to quantify the characteristics of an eruption across a population.

It provides all necessary data and definitions for a quantitative solution grounded in established principles of epidemiology and dermatology.\n\nThe task is to compute the relative risk ($RR$) of lesion involvement for the trunk versus the extremities. In this context, risk is operationally defined as the spatial incidence density ($ID$), which is the number of lesions per unit area. The relative risk is the ratio of the incidence density in the exposed group (trunk) to that in the reference group (extremities).\n\nLet $BSA_{total}$ be the aggregate Body Surface Area for the cohort.\n$$BSA_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{BSA}_i = 288 \\text{ m}^2$$\nThe proportions of this total area corresponding to the trunk and extremities are given as $P_{trunk} = 0.36$ and $P_{extremities} = 0.54$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total surface area for each anatomic region across the entire cohort.\nThe total area of the trunk at risk is:\n$$A_{trunk} = P_{trunk} \\times BSA_{total} = 0.36 \\times 288 \\text{ m}^2 = 103.68 \\text{ m}^2$$\nThe total area of the extremities at risk is:\n$$A_{extremities} = P_{extremities} \\times BSA_{total} = 0.54 \\times 288 \\text{ m}^2 = 155.52 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the spatial incidence density for each region.

The exact result $2.4$ is expressed as $2.400$ to meet this requirement.\n\nThe succinct interpretation of this result is as follows:\nA relative risk of $2.400$ signifies that the incidence density of lesions is $2.4$ times higher on the trunk than on the extremities. This indicates a distinct spatial pattern of **truncal predominance**, also known as a **centripetal distribution**. In the differential diagnosis of acute generalized eruptions, this pattern is a critical clinical clue. It strongly suggests diagnoses characterized by such a distribution (e.g., pityriasis rosea, many viral exanthems like roseola infantum, secondary syphilis, or certain drug eruptions) while making diseases with a **centrifugal** (greater involvement of extremities) or **acral** (distal extremity) distribution less likely (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever, erythema multiforme, hand-foot-and-mouth disease).

A $32$-year-old with a $6$-year history of chronic plaque psoriasis reports that on day $0$ he sustained multiple linear abrasions on the anterior shins during a trail run. The abrasions were superficial and healed without infection. He denies new topical exposures and had no systemic symptoms. On day $14$, he noted the emergence of sharply demarcated, erythematous plaques with micaceous scaling exactly tracing the paths of the healed abrasions, with no lesions elsewhere. Physical examination confirms plaque morphology along linear tracks on the shins; prior plaques on the elbows are stable.\n\nYou are asked to infer whether the observed pattern is consistent with Koebnerization and, based on first principles of cutaneous immunology and known pathophysiology of psoriasis, propose the most appropriate prevention strategy for future procedures or repetitive friction exposure.\n\nUse the following fundamental base for your reasoning: in psoriasis, mechanical trauma releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin LL-$37$ from keratinocytes; LL-$37$ can complex with self-DNA or self-RNA and activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) via Toll-like receptor $9$ (TLR-$9$), leading to interferon-$\\alpha$ production, myeloid dendritic cell activation, and subsequent interleukin-$23$ (IL-$23$) driven T helper $17$ (Th$17$) responses with interleukin-$17$ (IL-$17$) and interleukin-$22$ (IL-$22$) release, which in turn drive keratinocyte hyperproliferation and plaque formation.

In contrast, neutrophilic pathergy reactions, as in Behçet disease, typically occur within $24$ to $48$ hours.\n\nWhich option best integrates the timeline and distribution to determine the likelihood of Koebnerization and proposes a prevention strategy grounded in this pathophysiology?\n\nA. The $14$-day latency and precise isomorphic distribution along linear abrasions are consistent with Koebnerization in psoriasis; prevention centers on minimizing mechanical shear and microtrauma (e.g., silicone-based friction-reducing dressings, gentle tape techniques), promptly blunting post-injury innate activation with short-course topical corticosteroids on traumatized sites, and optimizing systemic control of the IL-$23$/Th$17$ axis (e.g., IL-$17$ or IL-$23$ inhibitors) before planned procedures.\n\nB. The rapid onset suggests neutrophilic pathergy within $24$ to $48$ hours; prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids before minor trauma are the most effective means of prevention.\n\nC. Koebnerization is unlikely because psoriasis requires several months to convert mechanical injury into plaque formation; prevention should rely on targeted ultraviolet C irradiation of injured skin to sterilize and suppress immune activation.\n\nD.

The clinical presentation is a textbook example of the Koebner phenomenon (isomorphic response) in a patient with psoriasis. The provided pathophysiological cascade involving DAMPs, LL-$37$, pDCs, TLR-$9$, the IL-$23$/Th$17$ axis, and downstream cytokines (IL-$17$, IL-$22$) is a well-established, state-of-the-art model for the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis.

It presents a clear clinical scenario and a specific pathophysiological model, then asks for an inference and a prevention strategy based on that model. A unique, logical solution can be derived from the provided information.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is objective, using precise clinical and immunological terminology. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed by analyzing the case based on the given principles and evaluating each option.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe core task is to identify the clinical phenomenon and propose a prevention strategy based on the provided pathophysiology.\n\n1.  **Identification of the Phenomenon:**\n    - The patient has pre-existing psoriasis.\n    - An external trigger (mechanical trauma) occurred at a specific site.\n    - New lesions, morphologically identical to psoriasis (\"plaque morphology\"), appeared later.\n    - The distribution of these new lesions is isomorphic, meaning they conform to the shape of the initial injury (\"exactly tracing the paths of the healed abrasions\").\n    - The time delay, or latency, between the injury (day $0$) and the appearance of plaques (day $14$) is $14$ days. The problem statement explicitly notes that the latency for this process in psoriasis is \"days to weeks,\" which perfectly encompasses a $14$-day period.\n    - This constellation of findings—an isomorphic response of a pre-existing dermatosis to trauma with a characteristic latency—is the definition of the Koebner phenomenon, also known as Koebnerization. The problem explicitly contrasts this with the `$24$` to `$48$` hour latency of pathergy, ruling out the latter.\n\n2.  **Development of a Prevention Strategy:**\n    A rational prevention strategy must target key steps in the provided pathophysiological cascade:\n    - **Step 1 (Trigger):** Trauma releases DAMPs/LL-$37$. The most direct prevention is to avoid or minimize the initial trigger. This involves meticulous skin care and protection from mechanical injury (friction, pressure, cuts). For planned procedures (e.g., surgery), this would involve careful technique and protective dressings.\n    - **Step 2 (Innate Activation):** pDCs are activated by LL-$37$/self-nucleic acid complexes. To intervene after trauma has already occurred, one could apply anti-inflammatory agents to the site of injury to dampen this initial innate immune response. Potent topical corticosteroids are a logical choice for this purpose, as they have broad anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.\n    - **Steps 3-9 (Adaptive Axis and Effector Phase):** The activation of the mDC-IL-$23$-Th$17$-IL-$17$/IL-$22$ axis is the core driver of established psoriasis and its flare in response to triggers. A patient who exhibits Koebnerization has a demonstrably active or easily triggered pathogenic immune pathway. Therefore, the most robust prevention strategy, particularly in anticipation of significant or unavoidable trauma, is to achieve excellent systemic control of the underlying disease by targeting this central axis. Modern biologic therapies, such as IL-$17$ inhibitors and IL-$23$ inhibitors, are specifically designed to block these pathways and are highly effective in suppressing psoriatic inflammation, thereby raising the threshold for Koebnerization.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The $14$-day latency and precise isomorphic distribution along linear abrasions are consistent with Koebnerization in psoriasis; prevention centers on minimizing mechanical shear and microtrauma (e.g., silicone-based friction-reducing dressings, gentle tape techniques), promptly blunting post-injury innate activation with short-course topical corticosteroids on traumatized sites, and optimizing systemic control of the IL-$23$/Th$17$ axis (e.g., IL-$17$ or IL-$23$ inhibitors) before planned procedures.**\n- **Analysis:** This option correctly identifies the phenomenon as Koebnerization based on the classic latency and isomorphic distribution. The proposed prevention strategy is a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach that correctly targets distinct stages of the given pathophysiology: (1) minimizing the trigger (mechanical protection), (2) blunting the early innate response after injury (topical corticosteroids), and (3) suppressing the underlying adaptive immune pathway responsible for the disease (systemic therapy targeting the IL-$23$/Th$17$ axis). This is a scientifically and clinically sound strategy.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The rapid onset suggests neutrophilic pathergy within $24$ to $48$ hours; prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids before minor trauma are the most effective means of prevention.**\n- **Analysis:** The premise of \"rapid onset\" is false. The onset was at $14$ days, not within `$24$` to `$48$` hours. The problem explicitly defines the `$24$`-`$48$` hour window as characteristic of pathergy, which contrasts with the observed timeline. Therefore, the diagnosis is incorrect. Furthermore, since the abrasions \"healed without infection,\" prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. The use of systemic corticosteroids for minor trauma is generally not a first-line strategy due to the risk/benefit profile.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Koebnerization is unlikely because psoriasis requires several months to convert mechanical injury into plaque formation; prevention should rely on targeted ultraviolet C irradiation of injured skin to sterilize and suppress immune activation.**\n- **Analysis:** The premise that Koebnerization takes \"several months\" is factually incorrect. The typical latency is days to weeks, as stated in the problem and confirmed by clinical literature. The proposed intervention, ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation, is not a standard treatment for psoriasis; therapeutic phototherapy uses ultraviolet B (UVB) or ultraviolet A (UVA). UVC is primarily germicidal and has limited penetration into the epidermis and dermis.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The pattern most likely represents allergic contact dermatitis from trail contaminants; prevention should focus solely on patch testing and strict allergen avoidance without altering baseline psoriasis immunotherapy.**\n- **Analysis:** This diagnosis is inconsistent with the clinical findings. The described morphology of \"sharply demarcated, erythematous plaques with micaceous scaling\" is classic for psoriasis, not for acute allergic contact dermatitis, which typically presents as an eczematous reaction (e.g., with erythema, edema, vesicles, and weeping). The appearance of lesions identical to the patient's underlying condition is the key feature of the isomorphic response (Koebnerization), making an alternative diagnosis far less likely. The proposed management, which ignores the clear link to the patient's active psoriatic diathesis, is inappropriate.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4469713"}]}
