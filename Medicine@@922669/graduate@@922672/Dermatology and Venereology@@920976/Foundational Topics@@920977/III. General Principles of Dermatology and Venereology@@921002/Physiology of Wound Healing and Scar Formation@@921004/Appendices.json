We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to construct a mass-balance model for the collagen concentration $C(t)$ in a wound. The law of mass conservation states that the net rate of change of a substance in a control volume equals the rate of synthesis minus the rate of removal.\nThe net rate of change of collagen concentration is given by the time derivative $\\frac{dC}{dt}$.\nThe synthesis rate is given as a constant, $k_s$.\nThe degradation rate is given as a first-order process, proportional to the concentration $C(t)$, written as $k_d C(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the mass-balance model is the following ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_s - k_d C(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation.
