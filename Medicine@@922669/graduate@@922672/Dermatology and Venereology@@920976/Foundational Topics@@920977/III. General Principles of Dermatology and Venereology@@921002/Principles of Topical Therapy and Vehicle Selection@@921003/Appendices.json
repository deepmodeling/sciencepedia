The FTU is a standardized measure for the amount of a semi-solid topical medication.

Let $M_{total}$ be the total mass of cream required to cover $A_{treat}$.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing one-dimensional diffusion at steady state is Fick's first law:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $J$ is the mass flux, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ is the concentration gradient. The concentration $C$ here refers to the concentration within the diffusion medium, which is the stratum corneum (SC).\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, the flux $J$ is constant with respect to position $x$. We can integrate the equation across the thickness of the SC, from $x=0$ (vehicle-SC interface) to $x=h$ (SC-viable epidermis interface):\n$$J \\int_{0}^{h} dx = -D \\int_{C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(0)}^{C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(h)} dC$$\n$$J \\cdot h = -D [C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(h) - C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(0)]$$\n$$J = \\frac{D [C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(0) - C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(h)]}{h}$$\n\nNext, we must establish the boundary concentrations within the stratum corneum, $C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(0)$ and $C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(h)$.\nAt the vehicle-SC interface ($x=0$), the concentration in the SC is related to the concentration in the vehicle, $C_{\\mathrm{veh}}$, by the partition coefficient, $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(0)}{C_{\\mathrm{veh}}} \\implies C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(0) = K \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{veh}}$$\nAt the SC-viable epidermis interface ($x=h$), the problem states that the viable epidermis acts as a sink, meaning the drug is rapidly cleared. This implies the concentration is negligible:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{sc}}(h) \\approx 0$$\n\nSubstituting these boundary conditions into the integrated flux equation yields:\n$$J = \\frac{D [K \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{veh}} - 0]}{h} = \\frac{D K C_{\\mathrm{veh}}}{h}$$\n\nThe problem provides a value for $\\Delta C = 0.01 \\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, defined as the concentration difference \"between the donor vehicle and the sink receptor\". The concentration in the donor vehicle is $C_{\\mathrm{veh}}$, and the concentration in the sink receptor is effectively zero. Therefore:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{\\mathrm{veh}} - C_{\\mathrm{sink}} = C_{\\mathrm{veh}} - 0 = C_{\\mathrm{veh}}$$\nSo, we can use $\\Delta C$ in place of $C_{\\mathrm{veh}}$. The final symbolic expression for the flux is:\n$$J = \\frac{D K \\Delta C}{h}$$\n\nBefore proceeding with numerical calculation, we must verify the dimensional consistency of this expression. The desired units for flux $J$ are mass per area per time ($\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).\nThe units of the parameters are:\n-   $D$: [Area]/[Time] ($\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$)\n-   $K$: Dimensionless (ratio of concentrations)\n-   $\\Delta C$: [Mass]/[Volume] ($\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$)\n-   $h$: [Length] ($\\mathrm{cm}$)\n\nSubstituting these dimensions into the expression for $J$:\n$$\\mathrm{Units\\ of\\ } J = \\frac{[\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{dimensionless}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}]}{[\\mathrm{cm}]} = \\frac{\\mathrm{cm}^{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{2}}$$\nThe resulting units are $\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is consistent with the definition of mass flux.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values. First, all units must be converted to a consistent system, in this case, the cgs (centimeter-gram-second) system.\n-   $D = 1 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$\n-   $K = 5$\n-   $\\Delta C = 0.01 \\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3} = 1 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$\n-   $h = 15 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.
