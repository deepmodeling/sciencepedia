Histopathology shows a nodular, perifollicular, and perivascular infiltrate of small B lymphocytes with admixed plasma cells, consistent with primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for immunoglobulin light chains demonstrates that plasma cells in the lesion predominantly express the kappa light chain with rare lambda-positive cells. Consider the following foundational facts: (i) mature B lymphocytes undergo immunoglobulin gene rearrangement such that a single cell expresses either the kappa or the lambda light chain, not both; (ii) a neoplastic clone derived from a single ancestor will exhibit light-chain restriction, that is, near-uniform expression of one light chain; (iii) a reactive polyclonal infiltrate typically contains a mixture of kappa- and lambda-expressing cells distributed within the physiological range observed in normal tissue. Using these bases, explain why light-chain restriction supports clonality in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and then, given that quantitative IHC in this PCMZL lesion yields $n_{\\kappa} = 90$ kappa-positive plasma cells and $n_{\\lambda} = 10$ lambda-positive plasma cells counted across equivalent high-power fields, calculate the kappa-to-lambda ratio defined by $R = \\frac{n_{\\kappa}}{n_{\\lambda}}$.

All information provided is consistent and relevant to the diagnosis of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: first, an explanation of why light-chain restriction supports clonality, and second, the calculation of the kappa-to-lambda ratio from the given data.\n\n**Part 1: Explanation of Light-Chain Restriction and Clonality**\n\nThe explanation rests on three foundational immunological principles provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Immunoglobulin Gene Rearrangement and Allelic Exclusion:** During its development, each B lymphocyte undergoes a process of somatic gene rearrangement to create a unique B-cell receptor (BCR), which is a membrane-bound form of an immunoglobulin molecule. An immunoglobulin is composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. The light chains can be one of two types: kappa ($\\kappa$) or lambda ($\\lambda$). A crucial aspect of this process is allelic exclusion, as stated in fact (i). A mature B cell commits to expressing only one type of light chain, either $\\kappa$ or $\\lambda$, but never both simultaneously.\n\n2.  **Polyclonal vs. Monoclonal Proliferation:** An immune response to a foreign antigen (e.g., an infection) is typically polyclonal. This means that multiple different B-cell precursors are activated, each recognizing a different epitope of the antigen. This results in a diverse population of B cells and their differentiated progeny, plasma cells. As stated in fact (iii), such a reactive, polyclonal infiltrate will contain a mixture of cells, some expressing $\\kappa$ light chains and others expressing $\\lambda$. In normal human lymphoid tissues, the ratio of $\\kappa$-expressing cells to $\\lambda$-expressing cells is approximately $2:1$, reflecting the underlying genetics of the immunoglobulin loci.\n\n3.  **Neoplasia and Clonality:** A neoplasm, such as a lymphoma, is by definition a clonal process. It arises from the uncontrolled proliferation of a single ancestral cell that has undergone malignant transformation. As stated in fact (ii), this means that all cells within the neoplastic population are genetically identical descendants of that single progenitor.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nBy combining these principles, we can understand why light-chain restriction is a hallmark of clonality. If a B-cell lymphoma develops from a single B-cell precursor, and that precursor was committed to producing, for example, the $\\kappa$ light chain, then all of its malignant daughter cells will also produce the $\\kappa$ light chain. The resulting tumor will be composed of a population of B cells and/or plasma cells that almost uniformly express the $\\kappa$ light chain. This phenomenon is termed light-chain restriction.\n\nWhen a pathologist examines a tissue sample, such as the skin biopsy in this case, and finds a population of B-cells or plasma cells that overwhelmingly expresses one light chain type over the other (i.e., a ratio significantly deviating from the normal polyclonal ratio of approximately $2:1$), it provides strong evidence for a monoclonal process. The observed predominance of $\\kappa$-positive plasma cells in the patient's lesion is therefore a key finding that supports the diagnosis of a B-cell neoplasm (in this case, PCMZL) over a benign, reactive inflammatory process. The few $\\lambda$-positive cells observed are interpreted as residual, non-neoplastic B cells or plasma cells that are part of the background inflammatory response or are entrapped within the tumor.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Kappa-to-Lambda Ratio**\n\nThe problem provides the quantitative results from immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on the patient's lesion. The number of kappa-positive plasma cells counted is given as $n_{\\kappa}$ and the number of lambda-positive plasma cells is given as $n_{\\lambda}$.\n\nThe given values are:\n-   Number of kappa-positive plasma cells: $n_{\\kappa} = 90$\n-   Number of lambda-positive plasma cells: $n_{\\lambda} = 10$\n\nThe kappa-to-lambda ratio, denoted by $R$, is defined as the ratio of the number of kappa-positive cells to the number of lambda-positive cells. The formula is:\n$$R = \\frac{n_{\\kappa}}{n_{\\lambda}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$R = \\frac{90}{10}$$\n\nPerforming the division yields the final result:\n$$R = 9$$\n\nThis calculated ratio of $9:1$ is significantly higher than the typical polyclonal ratio of approximately $2:1$, quantitatively confirming the presence of light-chain restriction and supporting the diagnosis of a clonal B-cell process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "4483670"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma is established, accurate staging is paramount for determining prognosis and selecting the most appropriate management strategy.

It presents a clinically and scientifically sound scenario within the field of dermatologic oncology.

The patient has $3$ cutaneous plaques. Since the number of lesions is greater than one, stage $T_1$ (solitary lesion) is excluded.\n\n2.  All $3$ lesions are located on the posterior trunk. The trunk is considered a single anatomical body region. The problem explicitly states there are no lesions on the head, neck, or extremities. Therefore, the patient's skin involvement is limited to a single body region.\n\n3.  This clinical picture—multiple lesions limited to one body region—directly corresponds to the definition of stage $T_2$: Regional skin lesions.\n\nStage $T_3$ (generalized lesions) would require involvement of additional, non-contiguous body regions (e.g., lesions on both the trunk and a lower extremity), which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct tumor stage for this patient is $T_2$.\n\nAs requested, the $T$ stage is a critical factor in determining the therapeutic strategy for indolent primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas. Stage $T_1$ and $T_2$ disease are considered localized. For a solitary $T_1$ lesion, complete surgical excision or definitive localized radiotherapy are excellent first-line options, both offering high rates of local control and cure. For regional $T_2$ disease, such as the $3$ plaques presented in this case, localized radiotherapy encompassing all involved sites is the standard of care and is highly effective. Surgical excision of multiple lesions may be considered but is often less practical than radiotherapy. The key principle for $T_1$ and $T_2$ disease is that the disease is confined and thus amenable to local-recourse therapies. In contrast, $T_3$ disease involves widespread skin lesions, making comprehensive local therapy with surgery or radiotherapy impractical due to morbidity and cumulative radiation dose. For asymptomatic $T_3$ disease, a \"watch and wait\" approach is often employed. For symptomatic or progressive $T_3$ disease, systemic therapies such as rituximab may be indicated. The $T$ stage thus fundamentally differentiates between disease suitable for local curative-intent therapy ($T_1$/$T_2$) and disease that may require observation or systemic management ($T_3$).\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be reported as an integer code according to the mapping $T_1 \\mapsto 1$, $T_2 \\mapsto 2$, $T_3 \\mapsto 3$, and $T_4 \\mapsto 4$.
