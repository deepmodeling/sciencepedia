It is a well-defined biostatistics problem that can be solved using the provided data and standard survival analysis formulas. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to calculate the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$). The $NNT$ is defined as the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$).\n\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}\n$$\n\nThe $ARR$ is the difference between the risk of the event (in this case, recurrence) in the control group ($R_c$) and the risk of the event in the treatment group ($R_t$) over a specified time period.\n\n$$\nARR = R_c(t) - R_t(t)\n$$\n\nThe problem provides data for a time horizon of $t=3$ years. The cumulative risk of recurrence by $3$ years for the control group (no adjuvant therapy) is given as $R_c(3) = 0.42$.\n\nWe must now determine the cumulative risk of recurrence for the treatment group, $R_t(3)$.\n\nThe cumulative risk of recurrence, $R(t)$, is related to the Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS) function, $S(t)$, by the equation:\n\n$$\nR(t) = 1 - S(t)\n$$\n\nTherefore, for the control group, the RFS at $3$ years is:\n\n$$\nS_c(3) = 1 - R_c(3) = 1 - 0.42 = 0.58\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the recurrence process can be described by an exponential survival model with a constant baseline hazard, let's call it $\\lambda$. The survival function for a constant hazard rate is given by:\n\n$$\nS_c(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\n\nIt is also stated that the treatment effect follows a proportional hazards model, with a constant hazard ratio, $HR = 0.58$. This means the hazard rate for the treatment group, $h_t(t)$, is proportional to the hazard rate for the control group, $h_c(t) = \\lambda$:\n\n$$\nh_t(t) = HR \\cdot h_c(t) = HR \\cdot \\lambda\n$$\n\nThe survival function for the treatment group, $S_t(t)$, is therefore:\n\n$$\nS_t(t) = \\exp(-(HR \\cdot \\lambda) t)\n$$\n\nA fundamental property of the proportional hazards model is the relationship between the survival functions of the treatment and control groups. We can express $S_t(t)$ in terms of $S_c(t)$:\n\n$$\nS_t(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t \\cdot HR) = (\\exp(-\\lambda t))^{HR} = (S_c(t))^{HR}\n$$\n\nUsing this relationship, we can calculate the RFS at $3$ years for the treatment group:\n\n$$\nS_t(3) = (S_c(3))^{HR}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the known values $S_c(3) = 0.58$ and $HR = 0.58$:\n\n$$\nS_t(3) = (0.58)^{0.58}\n$$\n\nCalculating this value:\n$S_t(3) \\approx 0.72910$\n\nNow we can find the cumulative risk of recurrence at $3$ years for the treatment group:\n\n$$\nR_t(3) = 1 - S_t(3) \\approx 1 - 0.72910 = 0.27090\n$$\n\nWith the risks for both groups, we can calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$):\n\n$$\nARR = R_c(3) - R_t(3) \\approx 0.42 - 0.27090 = 0.14910\n$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$):\n\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.14910} \\approx 6.7069\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n\n$$\nNNT \\approx 6.7\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6.7}\n$$", "id": "4447638"}, {"introduction": "Assessing tumor response to immunotherapy presents unique challenges not typically seen with cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as the phenomenon of 'pseudoprogression'.

This problem will allow you to apply both sets of criteria to a realistic patient case, calculating the change in tumor burden and making a response assessment that highlights the critical differences in how these systems handle new lesions [@problem_id:4447699].

Tumor burden is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and immune RECIST (iRECIST). The foundational facts you may use are:\n\n- Under RECIST 1.1, target lesions are selected (maximum of five in total, and a maximum of two per organ) and tumor burden is defined as the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response categories derive from changes in this sum relative to baseline: partial response is a decrease of at least $30\\%$ relative to baseline; progressive disease is an increase of at least $20\\%$ relative to the nadir with an absolute increase of at least $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, or the appearance of one or more new lesions; complete response requires disappearance of all target lesions. Stable disease is assigned when neither progressive disease nor partial/complete response criteria are met.\n- Under iRECIST, the appearance of new lesions yields immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD) rather than immediate progressive disease; confirmation is required at a subsequent time point for immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD). Otherwise, the principles for target lesion measurement and percentage change thresholds mirror RECIST 1.1.\n\nBaseline computed tomography identifies the following four target lesions consistent with RECIST 1.1 selection rules:\n\n- Hepatic segment VIII lesion: longest diameter $42\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Right lower lobe pulmonary lesion: longest diameter $28\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Left external iliac nodal lesion: longest diameter $33\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Subcutaneous flank lesion: longest diameter $19\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nAt the first on-treatment assessment $9$ weeks later, the same target lesions measure:\n\n- Hepatic segment VIII lesion: longest diameter $25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Right lower lobe pulmonary lesion: longest diameter $18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Left external iliac nodal lesion: longest diameter $21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Subcutaneous flank lesion: longest diameter $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nAdditionally, a new $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ lesion is identified in the left adrenal gland.

The shrinkage of target lesions by $37.70\\%$ would suggest an immune partial response (iPR). However, as with RECIST $1.1$, the appearance of a new lesion is a dominant finding.
