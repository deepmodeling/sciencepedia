This evaluation will be conducted using the algorithm developed and endorsed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The fundamental principle of this algorithm is the summation of points from four distinct diagnostic categories. A definitive diagnosis of early MF is established if the total score is greater than or equal to a specified threshold.\n\nThe diagnostic algorithm assigns points as follows, based on a global assessment of all features:\n\n**1. Clinical Criteria:** One point ($+1$) is awarded for each of the following features present:\n    *   Persistent and/or progressive patches/plaques.\n    *   Lesions located in non-sun-exposed areas.\n    *   Variation in the size and shape of lesions.\n    *   Presence of poikiloderma.\n\nThe patient's clinical presentation includes:\n    *   \"long-standing erythematous patches,\" which qualifies as persistent patches. This contributes $+1$ point.\n    *   Lesions \"predominantly on the buttocks,\" a non-sun-exposed area. This contributes $+1$ point.\n    *   \"clinical evidence of poikiloderma.\" This contributes $+1$ point.\n    *   Variation in size and shape is not mentioned in the provided data. This contributes $0$ points.\nThe clinical score, $S_{\\text{clinical}}$, is the sum of these points:\n$$S_{\\text{clinical}} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3$$\n\n**2. Histopathologic Criteria:** One point ($+1$) is awarded for each of the following features observed in a lesional biopsy demonstrating a superficial lymphoid infiltrate:\n    *   Epidermotropism without significant spongiosis.\n    *   Atypical lymphocytes.\n\nThe patient's histopathologic findings from the lesional biopsy include:\n    *   \"a superficial lymphocytic infiltrate with epidermotropism and ... no significant spongiosis.\" This satisfies the first criterion, contributing $+1$ point.\n    *   \"cytologic atypia of small to medium lymphocytes.\" This satisfies the second criterion, contributing $+1$ point.\nThe histopathologic score, $S_{\\text{histopathologic}}$, is the sum of these points:\n$$S_{\\text{histopathologic}} = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n\n**3. Immunopathologic Criteria:** One point ($+1$) is awarded for specific findings of T-cell aberrancy. The relevant criterion, given the provided information, is:\n    *   Loss of one or more T-cell antigens, such as $\\text{CD}2$, $\\text{CD}3$, $\\text{CD}5$, or $\\text{CD}7$. In the formal algorithm, significant loss of $\\text{CD}7$ (e.g., $<10\\%$ of T cells staining positive) is a key feature.\n\nThe patient's immunophenotyping shows \"partial loss of the T-cell marker cluster of differentiation $7$ ($\\text{CD}7$) among lesional T cells.\" This finding represents an aberrant T-cell phenotype and contributes $+1$ point to the score.\nThe immunopathologic score, $S_{\\text{immunopathologic}}$, is therefore:\n$$S_{\\text{immunopathologic}} = 1$$\n\n**4. Molecular Criteria:** One point ($+1$) is awarded for:\n    *   Detection of a clonal T-cell receptor ($\\text{TCR}$) gene rearrangement via methods such as polymerase chain reaction ($\\text{PCR}$) analysis.\n\nThe patient's molecular analysis demonstrated a \"positive clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement.\" This contributes $+1$ point.\nThe molecular score, $S_{\\text{molecular}}$, is:\n$$S_{\\text{molecular}} = 1$$\n\n**Total Diagnostic Score Calculation:**\nThe total diagnostic score, $S_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the scores from all four categories:\n$$S_{\\text{total}} = S_{\\text{clinical}} + S_{\\text{histopathologic}} + S_{\\text{immunopathologic}} + S_{\\text{molecular}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$S_{\\text{total}} = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7$$\n\n**Justification for Diagnosis based on Algorithm Principles:**\nThe first principle of the ISCL-EORTC algorithm for early MF establishes a diagnostic threshold. A total score of $4$ or greater is required for a definitive diagnosis. The patient's calculated score is $S_{\\text{total}} = 7$. Since this score exceeds the required threshold:\n$$7 \\ge 4$$\nthe criteria for a diagnosis of early mycosis fungoides are unequivocally met. The combination of persistent, poikilodermatous patches in a non-sun-exposed area, coupled with hallmark histopathologic findings of epidermotropism and atypia, and further substantiated by immunophenotypic aberrancy ($\\text{CD}7$ loss) and molecular evidence of clonality ($\\text{TCR}$ gene rearrangement), provides a robust and multi-faceted basis for the diagnosis according to the established algorithm.

It is a direct application of the established International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) staging system for mycosis fungoides. The solution proceeds by systematically applying the provided definitions and rules.\n\n**1. Assignment of T, N, M, and B Categories**\n\nThe TNMB categories are determined by mapping the patient's clinical and pathological findings to the provided definitions.\n\n*   **T (Tumor) Category**: The patient presents with \"patch-only lesions\" covering a body surface area fraction of $0.08$. The definition for the $T1$ category is \"patches and/or plaques involving less than $0.10$ of total skin surface area\". Since the patient's body surface area involvement is $0.08$, and $0.08 < 0.10$, the T category is $T1$.\n\n*   **N (Node) Category**: The physical examination reveals \"non-tender, mobile lymph nodes,\" which are clinically palpable or abnormal. The definitive staging, however, relies on the histopathology of the lymph node biopsy. The biopsy result is \"dermatopathic lymphadenitis without effacement or atypical lymphoid infiltration\". This finding directly corresponds to the definition of the $N1$ category, which is \"dermatopathic lymphadenitis without atypical lymphoid infiltration\". Therefore, the N category is $N1$.\n\n*   **M (Metastasis) Category**: Imaging studies show \"no visceral organ involvement\". This aligns with the definition of the $M0$ category, which is \"no visceral involvement\". Thus, the M category is $M0$.\n\n*   **B (Blood) Category**: Blood tests reveal \"no significant circulating atypical lymphocytes,\" and flow cytometry \"does not meet criteria for high tumor burden\". The definition provided for the $B0$ category is \"no significant blood involvement\". The patient's findings are a direct match for this definition. The stated absence of criteria for high tumor burden ($B2$) further supports classifying the patient as having low blood involvement, which is $B0$. Therefore, the B category is $B0$.\n\nIn summary, the patient's complete TNMB classification is $T1 \\, N1 \\, M0 \\, B0$.\n\n**2. Determination of the ISCL/EORTC Stage Group**\n\nUsing the assigned TNMB classification of $T1 \\, N1 \\, M0 \\, B0$, we apply the ISCL/EORTC stage grouping rules:\n\n*   Stage $\\mathrm{IA}$: Requires $T1\\,N0\\,M0$. The patient is $N1$, so this stage is excluded.\n*   Stage $\\mathrm{IB}$: Requires $T2\\,N0\\,M0$. The patient is $T1$ and $N1$, so this stage is excluded.\n*   Stage $\\mathrm{IIA}$: Requires \"$T1$ or $T2$ with $N1$ or $N2$, $M0$, and $B0$ or $B1$\".\n    *   The patient's T category is $T1$, which satisfies the \"$T1$ or $T2$\" criterion.\n    *   The patient's N category is $N1$, which satisfies the \"$N1$ or $N2$\" criterion.\n    *   The patient's M category is $M0$, which satisfies the \"$M0$\" criterion.\n    *   The patient's B category is $B0$, which satisfies the \"$B0$ or $B1$\" criterion.\n    *   All conditions for Stage $\\mathrm{IIA}$ are met.\n\n*   Other stages are excluded: Stage $\\mathrm{IIB}$ requires $T3$; Stage $\\mathrm{III}$ requires $T4$; Stage $\\mathrm{IVA1}$ requires $B2$; Stage $\\mathrm{IVA2}$ requires $N3$; and Stage $\\mathrm{IVB}$ requires $M1$. The patient does not meet any of these criteria.\n\nTherefore, the patient's disease is classified as Stage $\\mathrm{IIA}$.\n\n**3. Computation of Stage Severity Number $S$**\n\nThe stage severity number $S$ is defined by mapping the Roman numeral of the stage group to an integer, ignoring any letter suffix: $\\mathrm{I} \\mapsto 1$, $\\mathrm{II} \\mapsto 2$, $\\mathrm{III} \\mapsto 3$, $\\mathrm{IV} \\mapsto 4$.\nThe patient's stage group is $\\mathrm{IIA}$. The Roman numeral is $\\mathrm{II}$.\nAccording to the defined mapping, $\\mathrm{II} \\mapsto 2$.\nThus, the stage severity number is $S = 2$.\n\n**4. Justification of Recommended First-Line Management**\n\nThe patient's diagnosis is Stage $\\mathrm{IIA}$ ($T1\\,N1\\,M0\\,B0$) mycosis fungoides. Management decisions are derived from the principle of matching treatment intensity to disease burden.\n\n*   **Disease Burden Analysis**: The overall disease burden is low. The skin involvement is limited ($T1$, $<10\\%$ BSA), there is no visceral metastasis ($M0$), and no significant blood involvement ($B0$). The $N1$ finding represents reactive lymph node changes (dermatopathic lymphadenitis) rather than malignant infiltration. While this elevates the stage from $\\mathrm{I}$ to $\\mathrm{IIA}$, it does not represent a high-risk feature that necessitates immediate systemic therapy. The disease is considered early-stage.\n\n*   **Management Principles for Early-Stage Mycosis Fungoides**: The primary goal for early-stage mycosis fungoides (Stages $\\mathrm{IA}$, $\\mathrm{IB}$, $\\mathrm{IIA}$) is to control the cutaneous manifestations, induce remission, and maintain quality of life using treatments with the most favorable risk-benefit profile. Aggressive systemic therapies are generally reserved for more advanced or refractory disease due to their higher toxicity.\n\n*   **Recommended First-Line Options**: Based on these principles, the recommended first-line management for this patient should be skin-directed therapies (SDTs). Appropriate options include:\n    1.  **Phototherapy**: This is a mainstay for patch-stage disease. Narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) is highly effective and safe for treating thin, widespread patches. Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is another effective option, though typically preferred for thicker plaques.\n    2.  **Topical Corticosteroids**: High-potency topical steroids are a standard first-line choice, particularly for patients with more localized disease.\n    3.  **Other Topical Agents**: Topical mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard) or topical retinoids (e.g., bexarotene) are also valid first-line or second-line choices for skin-directed treatment.\n\nSystemic therapy is not indicated as a first-line treatment for this patient profile. The current standard of care for Stage $\\mathrm{IIA}$ disease with low skin burden ($T1$) and non-malignant nodal involvement ($N1$) is to initiate treatment with skin-directed modalities. Systemic agents would be considered only if the disease proves refractory to SDTs or progresses to a higher stage.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "4465168"}, {"introduction": "Effective long-term management of MF requires ongoing assessment for disease progression, which can involve the skin, lymph nodes, blood, and visceral organs.

The clinical, histopathological, and laboratory data provided are internally consistent and represent a plausible clinical scenario. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to determine the TNMB categories and overall stage. It is not based on any factual unsoundness, is not ambiguous, and requires a formal application of a diagnostic algorithm rather than subjective interpretation. All validation criteria are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by determining each component of the TNMB classification, assigning the overall stage, justifying the management approach, and finally computing the requested composite code $C$.\n\n**T (Tumor) Category Determination**\nThe T category is determined by the extent and type of skin involvement. The ISCL/EORTC criteria are:\n- T1: Patches and/or plaques covering $< 10\\%$ of the body surface area (BSA).\n- T2: Patches and/or plaques covering $\\ge 10\\%$ of the BSA.\n- T3: One or more tumors ($\\ge 1 \\ \\text{cm}$ in diameter).\n- T4: Confluent erythema covering $\\ge 80\\%$ of the BSA (erythroderma).\n\nThe patient has patches and plaques involving $0.12$ of TBSA, which is equivalent to $12\\%$. This finding alone would correspond to a T2 classification. However, the patient also presents with a new tumor on the thigh measuring $1.8 \\ \\text{cm}$ in diameter. The presence of one or more tumors of at least $1 \\ \\text{cm}$ diameter immediately assigns the highest T category that reflects this finding. Therefore, the presence of the tumor supersedes the plaque/patch involvement for staging purposes.\nThe T category is **T3**, corresponding to the numerical code $T=3$.\n\n**N (Node) Category Determination**\nThe N category is based on the clinical and histopathological status of peripheral lymph nodes. The criteria are:\n- N0: No clinically abnormal lymph nodes.\n- N1: Clinically abnormal nodes; histopathology shows dermatopathic changes only (no lymphoma).\n- N2: Clinically abnormal nodes; histopathology shows partial effacement of architecture by lymphoma.\n- N3: Clinically abnormal nodes; histopathology shows complete effacement of architecture by lymphoma.\n\nThe patient has clinically abnormal bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, with the largest node measuring $2.4 \\ \\text{cm}$. The excisional biopsy is critical. The pathology report states \"partial architectural effacement with paracortical expansion by... cerebriform lymphocytes... retention of sinusoidal structures\" and is explicitly interpreted as \"early nodal involvement without complete effacement.\" The presence of a clonal T-cell population confirms malignant involvement. This description precisely matches the criteria for N2. It is not N3 because effacement is not complete.\nThe N category is **N2**, corresponding to the numerical code $N=2$.\n\n**M (Metastasis) Category Determination**\nThe M category describes the presence or absence of visceral organ involvement.\n- M0: No visceral organ involvement.\n- M1: Visceral organ involvement confirmed by pathology.\n\nThe patient's contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows \"no hepatosplenomegaly, no visceral masses, and no pathologic extranodal organ involvement.\" This indicates no evidence of visceral disease.\nThe M category is **M0**, corresponding to the numerical code $M=0$.\n\n**B (Blood) Category Determination**\nThe B category quantifies the level of blood involvement.\n- B0: Absence of significant blood involvement ($\\le 5\\%$ of lymphocytes are Sézary cells and other criteria for B2 are not met).\n- B1: Low blood tumor burden ($>5\\%$ of lymphocytes are Sézary cells but criteria for B2 are not met).\n- B2: High blood tumor burden, defined by an absolute Sézary cell count $\\ge 1000 \\ \\text{cells} \\ \\mu \\text{L}^{-1}$ OR the presence of a T-cell clone in the blood with one of the following: (a) CD4/CD8 ratio $\\ge 10$, (b) expanded population of CD4$^{+}$ cells with abnormal phenotype (e.g., loss of CD7 $>40\\%$ or CD26 $>30\\%$).\n\nThe patient's absolute Sézary cell count is $600 \\ \\text{cells} \\ \\mu \\text{L}^{-1}$, which is below the primary threshold of $1000 \\ \\text{cells} \\ \\mu \\text{L}^{-1}$ for B2. We must check the secondary criteria.\nA T-cell clone matching the skin is present in the blood. We check the associated conditions:\n(a) The CD4/CD8 ratio is calculated from the absolute counts: $\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{L}^{-1}}{0.20 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{L}^{-1}} = 15$. Since $15 \\ge 10$, this criterion for B2 is met.\n(b) The patient has a $\\text{CD4}^{+}\\text{CD7}^{-}$ fraction of $0.48$ (or $48\\%$), which is $>40\\%$, and a $\\text{CD4}^{+}\\text{CD26}^{-}$ fraction of $0.54$ (or $54\\%$), which is $>30\\%$. These represent significant phenotypic abnormalities.\nSince the patient has a blood clone and meets at least one of the secondary criteria (in this case, all of them), the B classification is B2.\nThe B category is **B2**, corresponding to the numerical code $B=2$.\n\n**Overall Stage Grouping**\nThe overall stage group is determined by combining the T, N, M, and B categories according to the ISCL/EORTC staging chart.\nThe patient's final classification is T3 N2 M0 B2.\nThe staging definitions are:\n- Stage IIB: T3, N0/1/2, M0, B0/1.\n- Stage IVA1: Any T, Any N, M0, B2.\nThe patient has B2 blood involvement. The presence of B2 disease (high blood tumor burden) automatically places the patient in at least Stage IVA1, regardless of the T and N categories, provided there is no visceral metastasis (M0).\nThe stage group is **IVA1**.\nThe corresponding numerical code for the group is $G=7$.\n\n**Management Justification**\nThe patient has Stage IVA1 mycosis fungoides. This is advanced-stage disease characterized by systemic involvement across three compartments: skin (T3), lymph nodes (N2), and blood (B2). The patient has clearly progressed from an earlier patch/plaque disease. Management of early-stage MF (IA, IB) is typically focused on skin-directed therapies. However, for advanced-stage disease with extracutaneous involvement (nodes and blood) and high-burden skin disease (tumors), skin-directed therapies alone are inadequate to control disease and prevent further progression. Therefore, the clinical situation mandates an **escalation of therapy to include a systemic agent**. The presence of T3, N2, and B2 disease are all individual drivers for this decision; their confluence makes the case unequivocal. De-escalation or maintenance of previous (presumably skin-directed) therapy would be inappropriate and medically unsound given the objective evidence of disease progression and dissemination.\n\n**Final Calculation of the Composite Code C**\nThe values for the encoding are:\n- $G = 7$ (from Stage IVA1)\n- $T = 3$ (from T3)\n- $N = 2$ (from N2)\n- $M = 0$ (from M0)\n- $B = 2$ (from B2)\n\nThe composite code $C$ is calculated using the given formula:\n$$C = 10000 \\, G + 1000 \\, T + 100 \\, N + 10 \\, M + B$$\n$$C = 10000(7) + 1000(3) + 100(2) + 10(0) + 2$$\n$$C = 70000 + 3000 + 200 + 0 + 2$$\n$$C = 73202$$\nThe final calculated integer is $73202$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{73202}$$", "id": "4465161"}]}
