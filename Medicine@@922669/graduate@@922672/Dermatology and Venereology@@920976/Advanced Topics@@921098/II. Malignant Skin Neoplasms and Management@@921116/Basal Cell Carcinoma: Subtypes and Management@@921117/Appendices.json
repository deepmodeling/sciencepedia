Given the major axis (length $L$) and minor axis (width $w$), the area is:\n$$ A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} Lw $$\n\nThe problem defines the minor axis as the tumor diameter ($D$) plus twice the margin ($m$), so $w = D + 2m$. The major axis is three times the minor axis, so $L = 3w$. Substituting these into the area formula gives the area of the excised specimen as a function of the margin, $A(m)$:\n$$ A(m) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (3w)w = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} w^2 = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} (D + 2m)^2 $$\n\nWe need to find the difference in area, $\\Delta A$, between an excision with a margin of $m_2 = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and one with $m_1 = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, for a tumor of diameter $D = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$ \\Delta A = A(m_2) - A(m_1) = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} (D + 2m_2)^2 - \\frac{3\\pi}{4} (D + 2m_1)^2 $$\nFactoring out the constant and using the difference of squares formula, $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$:\n$$ \\Delta A = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\left[ (D + 2m_2)^2 - (D + 2m_1)^2 \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta A = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\left[ ((D + 2m_2) - (D + 2m_1))((D + 2m_2) + (D + 2m_1)) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta A = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\left[ (2m_2 - 2m_1)(2D + 2m_1 + 2m_2) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta A = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\left[ 4(m_2 - m_1)(D + m_1 + m_2) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta A = 3\\pi (m_2 - m_1)(D + m_1 + m_2) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values: $D = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $m_1 = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $m_2 = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$ \\Delta A = 3\\pi (5 - 3)(12 + 3 + 5) $$\n$$ \\Delta A = 3\\pi (2)(20) = 120\\pi \\, \\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\nUsing $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$:\n$$ \\Delta A \\approx 120 \\times 3.14159 = 376.9908 \\, \\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the difference in tissue sacrifice is $377.0 \\, \\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n\n### Part 2: Qualitative Discussion of Management Trade-offs\n\nThe choice between a $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and a $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ surgical margin for a well-defined nodular BCC exemplifies the core trade-off in dermatologic surgery between oncologic safety and functional-cosmetic preservation.\n\nA larger margin ($5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) provides a higher probability of achieving complete tumor removal in a single procedure, minimizing the risk of local recurrence and the need for re-excision. However, this comes at the cost of a larger surgical defect. On the face, this requires a more complex repair, leading to a longer scar and greater potential for distortion.\n\nConversely, a smaller margin ($3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) prioritizes tissue conservation, resulting in a smaller defect, simpler repair, and generally a better cosmetic result. For a low-risk, well-defined nodular BCC, a $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ or $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ margin is often sufficient, with cure rates over $95\\%$. The risk of incomplete excision is slightly higher, but this is often considered acceptable given the benefit of tissue preservation in a cosmetically sensitive area.\n\nMohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) resolves this dilemma. It involves intraoperative microscopic examination of $100\\%$ of the surgical margin, allowing the surgeon to remove the tumor \"roots\" precisely while maximally conserving healthy tissue. MMS provides the highest possible cure rate (up to $99\\%$ for primary BCCs) and optimizes both oncologic clearance and the final aesthetic outcome, making it an excellent option for facial BCCs.

Histology shows a mixture of nodular and infiltrative growth patterns. The patient is treated with a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI) for $3$ months prior to definitive surgical excision. Use the following foundational, widely accepted facts for modeling:\n\n- Under Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), treatment response is quantified as a fractional change in the longest tumor diameter. Published median linear shrinkage after approximately $3$ months of HHI therapy is approximately $0.35$ for nodular basal cell carcinoma and $0.20$ for infiltrative basal cell carcinoma.\n- For a mixed lesion, assume the effective fractional linear shrinkage along the longest diameter is the weighted average of the subtype-specific shrinkages, weighted by the fractional linear contributions of each subtype along the longest axis.\n- Standard surgical excision for high-risk facial basal cell carcinoma uses a fixed clinical margin of $0.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ beyond the visible/clinically measurable tumor edge; assume this margin is applied equally before and after HHI, independent of shrinkage.\n- For primary closure by ellipse design, a commonly used surgical principle is that the optimal ellipse has a length-to-width ratio of approximately $3:1$. Assume the ellipse width equals the required excision width, which is the tumor diameter plus twice the clinical margin.\n\nSuppose along the longest axis the linear composition is $0.60$ nodular and $0.40$ infiltrative.
