The MMPDAI is defined as a sum of site-specific activity and damage contributions that reflect both current inflammation and accrued scarring. Assume the following fundamental definitions are the basis of this framework, consistent with standard disease activity indices in autoimmune blistering diseases:\n\n- For each mucosal site $s$ in the set $S=\\{$oral, ocular, nasal, laryngeal, esophageal, anogenital$\\}$, the activity component is defined by an extent score $E_{s}\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ and a lesion severity score $V_{s}\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ that represent, respectively, the spread of involvement and the most severe lesion type observed at that site. The site’s activity contribution is $A_{s}=w_{s}\\,(E_{s}+V_{s})$, where $w_{s}$ is a site weight reflecting functional risk and propensity to damage.\n- The damage component for site $s$ is a scarring indicator $G_{s}\\in\\{0,1\\}$, with $G_{s}=1$ indicating established scarring/synechiae at that site. The damage contribution is $D_{s}=u_{s}\\,G_{s}$, where $u_{s}$ is a site-specific damage weight reflecting the clinical impact of scarring at that site.\n- The total MMPDAI at a time point is $M=\\sum_{s\\in S}\\left(A_{s}+D_{s}\\right)$.\n- A Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is the smallest change in $M$ perceived as beneficial by patients and clinicians using an anchor-based method.

Mucous membrane pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepithelial blistering disorder driven by immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies targeting hemidesmosomal components of the basement membrane zone, leading to complement activation, inflammatory cell recruitment, and tissue injury. In sight-threatening ocular disease, systemic glucocorticoids are used acutely to suppress inflammation while steroid-sparing agents are initiated for long-term control.

Compute the initial daily dose as $1$ mg/kg/day.\n2. Begin taper only after $2$ consecutive weeks meeting the disease control definition.\n3.

The initial dose of $70$ mg/day is administered to gain control. The dose is maintained as control has not yet been achieved.\n  - Daily dose for Week $1$, $D_1 = 70$ mg.\n  - Daily dose for Week $2$, $D_2 = 70$ mg.\n\n- **Weeks $3$ and $4$**: The patient shows \"no new lesions\". In Week $3$, this marks the first week of control. In Week $4$, this marks the second consecutive week of control. According to the definition, \"disease control\" is achieved at the end of Week $4$. The dose remains unchanged during this stabilization period.\n  - Daily dose for Week $3$, $D_3 = 70$ mg.\n  - Daily dose for Week $4$, $D_4 = 70$ mg.\n\n- **Week $5$**: Tapering begins. The dose at the start of the week is $70$ mg.

The dose of $60$ mg/day is a controlling dose.\n\n- **Week $6$**: Tapering continues. The current dose is $60$ mg. Since the dose is $\\geq 60$ mg/day, the reduction is $10$ mg.\n  - Daily dose for Week $6$, $D_6 = D_5 - 10 \\text{ mg} = 60 - 10 = 50$ mg.\n  - Control is maintained. The dose of $50$ mg/day is a controlling dose.\n\n- **Week $7$**: Tapering continues. The current dose is $50$ mg. This falls into the $40 \\leq D < 60$ mg/day tier, so the reduction is $5$ mg.\n  - Daily dose for Week $7$, $D_7 = D_6 - 5 \\text{ mg} = 50 - 5 = 45$ mg.\n  - Control is maintained. The dose of $45$ mg/day is a controlling dose.\n\n- **Week $8$**: Tapering continues. The current dose is $45$ mg, which is in the $40 \\leq D < 60$ mg/day tier. The reduction is $5$ mg.\n  - Daily dose for Week $8$, $D_8 = D_7 - 5 \\text{ mg} = 45 - 5 = 40$ mg.\n  - A flare occurs this week (\"new lesions observed\"). This means the $40$ mg/day dose was insufficient. The last dose that maintained control was $D_7 = 45$ mg/day.\n\n- **Week $9$**: Flare management is applied. The dose is increased to the last controlling dose ($45$ mg/day) plus $5$ mg/day.\n  - Daily dose for Week $9$, $D_9 = 45 \\text{ mg} + 5 \\text{ mg} = 50$ mg.\n  - This dose is to be maintained for $2$ weeks.

The metabolism of $6$-MP proceeds along three competing pathways:\n1.  Catabolism to inactive $6$-thiouric acid by xanthine oxidase (XO).\n2.  Anabolic conversion to cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). TGNs are the active metabolites responsible for both therapeutic immunosuppression (via apoptosis of activated lymphocytes) and dose-limiting toxicity (myelosuppression).\n3.  Catabolism to inactive $6$-methylmercaptopurine ($6$-MMP) by Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT).\n\nIn a patient with intermediate TPMT activity, the catabolic pathway mediated by TPMT is impaired. This metabolic shunt results in a greater proportion of the parent drug ($6$-MP) being directed down the anabolic HPRT pathway. Consequently, at any given dose of azathioprine, a TPMT intermediate metabolizer will generate higher systemic concentrations of active TGNs compared to an individual with normal TPMT activity. This elevates the risk of profound and potentially life-threatening myelosuppression and, to a lesser extent, hepatotoxicity. The core principle of management, therefore, is to operate within a much narrower therapeutic window by initiating therapy at a reduced dose and escalating cautiously only under strict surveillance.\n\n**Evidence-Informed Titration and Monitoring Plan:**\n\nAn appropriate plan, grounded in the principles of pharmacovigilance, must include baseline assessments, frequent early monitoring, clear criteria for intervention, and a conservative dose-escalation strategy.\n\n**1. Baseline Assessments:**\nPrior to initiating azathioprine, it is imperative to establish a reliable baseline against which future changes can be measured.\n-   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential:** This is critical to document the patient's baseline white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Pre-existing cytopenias would be a relative contraindication or require extreme caution.\n-   **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** A panel including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin is required to establish baseline hepatic function. Pre-existing liver disease necessitates careful risk-benefit analysis.\n-   **TPMT Phenotype/Genotype:** This has already been performed as per the problem statement and is the cornerstone of the personalized dosing strategy.\n\n**2. Early-Phase Monitoring Frequency:**\nThe risk of myelosuppression is greatest during the initial $4$ to $8$ weeks of therapy as TGNs accumulate in hematopoietic progenitor cells and reach a steady state. Monitoring must be most intensive during this high-risk induction phase.\n-   **Weeks $1-4$:** CBC and LFTs should be monitored weekly.\n-   **Weeks $5-8$:** If counts and liver enzymes are stable, monitoring frequency can be reduced to every $2$ weeks.\n-   **Months $3-6$:** If stability is maintained, monitoring can be performed monthly.\n-   **Long-term Maintenance:** Once the patient is on a stable, effective, and well-tolerated maintenance dose for several months, monitoring frequency may be extended to every $3$ months.\n\n**3. Criteria to Hold or Reduce Dose:**\nPre-defined action thresholds are essential for patient safety. These thresholds are derived from clinical evidence and are designed to pre-empt severe toxicity.\n-   **Myelosuppression:**\n    -   If WBC count falls below $3.5 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ or the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) falls below $1.5 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, the dose should be reduced.\n    -   If WBC count falls below $3.0 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ or ANC falls below $1.0 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, azathioprine should be held. The drug may be re-challenged at a lower dose once counts recover.\n    -   If severe neutropenia (ANC $< 0.5 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$) occurs, the drug should be stopped immediately.\n    -   A significant fall in platelets (e.g., below $100 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$) also warrants dose reduction or cessation.\n-   **Hepatotoxicity:**\n    -   If ALT or AST levels rise to greater than $3$ times the upper limit of normal (ULN), the dose should be reduced or held, with more frequent monitoring.\n    -   If ALT or AST levels rise to greater than $5$ times the ULN, azathioprine should be stopped.\n    -   Any elevation in transaminases accompanied by an increase in bilirubin or clinical signs of liver failure is a medical emergency requiring immediate drug discontinuation.\n\n**4. Cautious Upward Titration Schema:**\nThe reduced starting dose of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ may be sub-therapeutic. Efficacy is balanced against safety by titrating the dose slowly.\n-   Dose increases should only be considered after at least $2$ to $4$ weeks at the current dose, provided that blood counts and LFTs remain stable and within acceptable limits.\n-   Dose increments should be small, for example, $25\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ at a time.\n-   After each dose increase, the patient re-enters a high-risk phase, and monitoring frequency should be increased temporarily (e.g., to weekly for $2$ weeks) to ensure safety at the new dose.\n-   The therapeutic goal is to reach the lowest effective dose that controls the mucous membrane pemphigoid without inducing toxicity. The maximum target dose in a TPMT intermediate metabolizer is generally capped at a lower level than in normal metabolizers, often around $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, but the titration must always be guided by clinical response and laboratory safety parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{35}$$", "id": "4464622"}]}
