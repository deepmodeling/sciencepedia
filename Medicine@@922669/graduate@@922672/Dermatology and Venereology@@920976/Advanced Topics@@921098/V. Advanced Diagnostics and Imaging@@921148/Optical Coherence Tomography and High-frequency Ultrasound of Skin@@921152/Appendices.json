This apparent thickness, as stated in the problem, corresponds to the one-way optical path length.\n\nThe fundamental principle of OCT is that it measures the time delay of light backscattered from different depths within a sample. This time delay, $\\tau$, is directly related to the round-trip distance traveled by light. However, the speed of light in a medium is $v = c/n$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $n$ is the refractive index of the medium. Consequently, the measured time delay corresponds to the optical path length ($OPL$) traveled, not the physical path length.\n\nThe problem defines the one-way optical path length, $L_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, along a propagation direction $z$ as:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\int n(z)\\,dz$$\nThe OCT system is imaging a single, uniform phantom layer at normal incidence.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a realistic problem in the design of biomedical imaging systems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must analyze three key performance metrics for an OCT system: axial resolution ($\\delta_z$), lateral resolution ($\\delta_x$), and depth of focus ($\\mathrm{DOF}$). We must also consider the wavelength-dependent penetration depth and SNR in skin.\n\n**1. Axial Resolution ($\\delta_z$)**\nThe axial resolution in OCT is determined by the coherence length of the light source. For a Gaussian spectrum, it is given by:\n$$ \\delta_z = \\frac{2 \\ln 2}{\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda_0^2}{n \\Delta \\lambda} \\approx 0.44 \\frac{\\lambda_0^2}{n \\Delta \\lambda} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the central wavelength, $\\Delta \\lambda$ is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral bandwidth, and $n$ is the refractive index of the medium. The requirement is to resolve $10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ features, so we require $\\delta_z \\lesssim 10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**2. Lateral Resolution ($\\delta_x$)**\nThe lateral resolution is determined by the diffraction-limited spot size of the objective lens. Using the Rayleigh criterion, this is:\n$$ \\delta_x = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda_0}{\\mathrm{NA}} $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{NA}$ is the numerical aperture of the objective. We require $\\delta_x \\lesssim 10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**3. Depth of Focus ($\\mathrm{DOF}$)**\nThe $\\mathrm{DOF}$ is the axial range over which the lateral resolution remains close to its minimum (diffraction-limited) value. Since dynamic refocusing is unavailable, a large $\\mathrm{DOF}$ is critical to maintain resolution across the $0.6~\\mathrm{mm}$ imaging depth. The $\\mathrm{DOF}$ is twice the Rayleigh range ($z_R$), given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{DOF} = 2 z_R = \\frac{2 n \\lambda_0}{\\pi (\\mathrm{NA})^2} $$\nA larger $\\mathrm{DOF}$ is achieved with a smaller $\\mathrm{NA}$, but this comes at the cost of poorer lateral resolution ($\\delta_x \\propto 1/\\mathrm{NA}$). This is the central trade-off. We need a $\\mathrm{DOF}$ that is a substantial fraction of the required $0.6~\\mathrm{mm}$ ($600~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) imaging depth.\n\n**4. SNR and Penetration Depth**\nImaging at $0.6~\\mathrm{mm}$ in skin requires sufficient light penetration. Attenuation in skin is due to absorption and scattering.\n- **Scattering**: Decreases with increasing wavelength ($\\lambda_0$), favoring longer wavelengths for deeper penetration.\n- **Absorption**: In the near-infrared, the main absorbers are melanin, hemoglobin, and water. The \"optical window\" for deep tissue imaging lies approximately between $0.7~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $1.4~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Wavelengths around $1.3~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ generally offer an excellent balance of low scattering and low absorption by water and other chromophores. Wavelengths below $1.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ suffer more scattering and melanin absorption, while wavelengths above $1.4~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (e.g., $1.55~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) suffer from strong water absorption, limiting penetration depth in hydrated tissue.\n- **SNR vs. NA**: The collected signal is proportional to $\\mathrm{NA}^2$. A lower NA, while necessary for a large DOF, reduces the signal collection efficiency and thus lowers the SNR. This must be balanced by choosing a wavelength with good penetration properties.\n\nWe will now calculate these metrics for each option using $n = 1.38$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\lambda_0 = 0.85~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta \\lambda = 0.05~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.20$**\n-   $\\delta_z = 0.44 \\frac{(0.85~\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.38 \\times 0.05~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 4.6~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\delta_x = 0.61 \\frac{0.85~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.20} \\approx 2.6~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\mathrm{DOF} = \\frac{2 \\times 1.38 \\times 0.85~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\pi (0.20)^2} \\approx 18.7~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   **Analysis**: The axial and lateral resolutions are excellent, well below the $10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ requirement. However, the $\\mathrm{DOF}$ is extremely small ($18.7~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), making it impossible to maintain focus over the required $600~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ depth. Furthermore, the $0.85~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ wavelength experiences significant scattering and melanin absorption, limiting penetration depth and SNR.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.

The axial resolution ($\\sim 5.4~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) is excellent. The lateral resolution ($\\sim 9.9~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) just meets the $10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ requirement. The central wavelength of $1.30~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is ideal for deep tissue imaging, minimizing scattering and avoiding major absorption peaks, thus maximizing SNR at the required depth. This favorable wavelength helps compensate for the lower light-gathering power of the small $\\mathrm{NA}=0.08$. The resulting $\\mathrm{DOF}$ of $\\sim 179~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is the largest among all options that satisfy the resolution criteria. While it does not cover the full $600~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ depth, it is a practical compromise for a fixed-focus system.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This set of parameters provides the most effective balance between meeting resolution requirements, ensuring deep penetration for good SNR, and achieving a usable depth of focus without dynamic refocusing.\n\n**C. $\\lambda_0 = 1.05~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta \\lambda = 0.03~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.12$**\n-   $\\delta_z = 0.44 \\frac{(1.05~\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.38 \\times 0.03~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 11.7~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\delta_x = 0.61 \\frac{1.05~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.12} \\approx 5.3~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\mathrm{DOF} = \\frac{2 \\times 1.38 \\times 1.05~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\pi (0.12)^2} \\approx 64.1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   **Analysis**: This option fails on two counts. The axial resolution of $11.7~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is worse than the $10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ requirement. The $\\mathrm{DOF}$ of $64.1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is also insufficient for the specified imaging depth.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. Fails to meet the axial resolution and depth of focus requirements.\n\n**D. $\\lambda_0 = 1.55~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta \\lambda = 0.15~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.05$**\n-   $\\delta_z = 0.44 \\frac{(1.55~\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.38 \\times 0.15~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 5.1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\delta_x = 0.61 \\frac{1.55~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.05} \\approx 18.9~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\mathrm{DOF} = \\frac{2 \\times 1.38 \\times 1.55~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\pi (0.05)^2} \\approx 545.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   **Analysis**: While the $\\mathrm{DOF}$ is excellent and nearly meets the $600~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ target, the lateral resolution of $18.9~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is far too coarse to resolve $10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ features. Furthermore, the $1.55~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ wavelength suffers from high water absorption, which would severely degrade the SNR at a depth of $0.6~\\mathrm{mm}$ in hydrated tissue.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. Fails to meet the lateral resolution requirement and is a poor choice of wavelength due to water absorption.\n\n**E. $\\lambda_0 = 0.90~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta \\lambda = 0.20~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.10$**\n-   $\\delta_z = 0.44 \\frac{(0.90~\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.38 \\times 0.20~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 1.3~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\delta_x = 0.61 \\frac{0.90~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.10} \\approx 5.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\mathrm{DOF} = \\frac{2 \\times 1.38 \\times 0.90~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\pi (0.10)^2} \\approx 79.1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   **Analysis**: This option provides exceptional axial and lateral resolution. However, like option A, the $\\mathrm{DOF}$ is far too small ($79.1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) for the application. The short wavelength of $0.90~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ also results in poorer penetration compared to longer wavelengths.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. Fails on the depth of focus requirement and is suboptimal for penetration.\n\n### Justification Summary\n\nThe problem exemplifies the fundamental trade-offs in optical imaging. High lateral resolution (requiring high $\\mathrm{NA}$) is diametrically opposed to a large depth of focus (requiring low $\\mathrm{NA}$). Since dynamic focusing is forbidden, a compromise must be found. Option B is the only one that successfully navigates this compromise. It uses a low $\\mathrm{NA}=0.08$ to achieve a usable $\\mathrm{DOF}$, which degrades the lateral resolution to the very edge of the required specification ($\\delta_x \\approx 9.9~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$). This is acceptable. Crucially, it combines this with a central wavelength of $\\lambda_0=1.30~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, which is optimal for deep penetration in skin, maximizing the SNR at depth and compensating for the poor light collection of the low-$\\mathrm{NA}$ objective. All other options fail decisively on at least one critical requirement: Options A, C, and E have an insufficient $\\mathrm{DOF}$, while Option D has insufficient lateral resolution and a poor choice of wavelength. Therefore, Option B represents the best-engineered solution among the choices. This situation is common in biophotonics, where textbook resolution is often sacrificed for practical imaging depth and signal quality, a trade-off that High-Frequency Ultrasound (HFUS) navigates differently by offering much greater penetration at the cost of substantially poorer resolution than any of these OCT options.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4468639"}]}
