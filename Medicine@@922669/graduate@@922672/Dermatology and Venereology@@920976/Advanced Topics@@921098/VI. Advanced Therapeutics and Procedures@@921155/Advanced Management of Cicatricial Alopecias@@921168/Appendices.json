The use of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide, the specified concentrations, injection volumes, lattice spacing, and the concept of a dose cap to mitigate side effects (atrophy, systemic absorption) are all standard and well-established in clinical practice. The underlying mathematical model using areal density is a sound and logical method for treatment planning.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary variables and definitions to perform the requested derivations and calculations. The tasks are clearly specified. The simplifying assumption that $N = \\rho A$ is an exact relationship removes ambiguity related to fitting a discrete lattice to a potentially irregular continuous area, ensuring that a unique, stable, and meaningful numerical solution exists for the quantitative parts of the problem.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or biases.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution will address the three tasks outlined in the problem statement in sequential order.\n\n#### Task 1: Derivation and Evaluation of Total Volume $V$\n\nThe objective is to derive a symbolic expression for the total volume $V$ in terms of the area $A$, lattice spacing $s$, and individual injection volume $v_{0}$, and then to calculate its numerical value.\n\nThe derivation begins with the provided foundational relationships:\n1.  The total volume $V$ is the product of the number of injections $N$ and the volume per injection $v_{0}$:\n    $$V = N v_{0}$$\n2.  The number of injections $N$ is the product of the areal point density $\\rho$ and the total area $A$:\n    $$N = \\rho A$$\n3.  The areal point density $\\rho$ for a uniform square lattice with spacing $s$ is given by:\n    $$\\rho = s^{-2} = \\frac{1}{s^2}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for $V$, we substitute the expression for $\\rho$ from equation (3) into equation (2):\n$$N = \\left(\\frac{1}{s^2}\\right) A = \\frac{A}{s^2}$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $N$ into equation (1):\n$$V = \\left(\\frac{A}{s^2}\\right) v_{0}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the total volume $V$ in terms of $A$, $s$, and $v_{0}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values: $A = 30\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2$, $s = 1\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, and $v_{0} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$V = \\frac{30\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2}{(1\\ \\mathrm{cm})^2} \\times 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe units are dimensionally consistent, as $\\mathrm{cm}^2 / \\mathrm{cm}^2$ is a dimensionless quantity, leaving the volume in $\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$V = \\frac{30}{1} \\times 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mL} = 30 \\times 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mL} = 3\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe total injectate volume is $3\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n#### Task 2: Proposal for a Clinically Implementable Injection Grid\n\nA clinically implementable grid must systematically deliver the injections across the $A = 30\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2$ active border, respecting its geometry and fulfilling the condition of $s=1\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ spacing.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of required injections, $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{A}{s^2} = \\frac{30\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2}{(1\\ \\mathrm{cm})^2} = 30$$\nThe plan requires precisely $30$ injections.\n\nA practical implementation on the patient's scalp proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Delineation:** The physician first delineates the entire contiguous $30\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2$ region of active inflammation, as identified by trichoscopy, using a surgical marking pen.\n2.  **Grid Imposition:** A conceptual square lattice with a grid spacing of $s = 1\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ is mentally or physically (using a sterile template) superimposed over the marked area.\n3.  **Point Placement:** The problem's assumption that $N = \\rho A$ simplifies the process by removing edge effects. This idealization implies the area can be perfectly tiled. The clinical procedure is to place one injection point at each lattice vertex that falls strictly within the delineated border. To ensure the active periphery is not undertreated, injections are typically placed approximately $0.5\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ inside the established border and then spaced $1\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ apart. For an irregularly shaped area, one would place as many points of the $1\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\times 1\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ grid as possible within the boundary, and then add points as needed to ensure the entire inflammatory rim is treated, adjusting positions slightly to maintain an approximate density of $1$ point per $\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n4.  **Execution:** $30$ separate injections, each with an aliquot of $v_{0} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, are administered at these predetermined points. This ensures a uniform distribution of the medication across the entire active zone, avoiding both untreated gaps (\"skip areas\") and excessive local concentration (\"spillover\" or pooling).\n\n#### Task 3: Dose Calculation and Safety Justification\n\nThe total steroid dose $D$ is computed and compared against the specified safety cap $D_{\\max} = 20\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nThe total dose $D$ is defined as the product of the concentration $C$ and the total volume $V$:\n$$D = C V$$\nUsing the given concentration $C = 5\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ and the calculated total volume $V = 3\\ \\mathrm{mL}$:\n$$D = (5\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}) \\times (3\\ \\mathrm{mL}) = 15\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe total administered dose of triamcinolone acetonide is $15\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nNext, we check this against the conservative per-session cap $D_{\\max} = 20\\ \\mathrm{mg}$:\n$$D = 15\\ \\mathrm{mg} < 20\\ \\mathrm{mg} = D_{\\max}$$\nThe calculated dose is below the maximum safety threshold.\n\nThe justification for such a cap from first principles is twofold, relating to local and systemic side effects of corticosteroids:\n1.  **Mitigation of Local Atrophy:** Corticosteroids exert their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation and the synthesis of extracellular matrix components, such as collagen. This is the desired therapeutic action in a fibrosing (cicatricial) alopecia. However, an excessive dose or concentration of corticosteroid in the dermis and subcutis leads to an exaggerated, uncontrolled version of this effect. The result is focal dermal and/or subcutaneous atrophy, manifesting as a visible depression or thinning of the skin. A per-session dose cap, combined with distribution of the total volume into small, spaced aliquots, is a primary strategy to deliver a therapeutic dose while keeping local concentrations below the threshold that induces iatrogenic atrophy.\n2.  **Prevention of Systemic Absorption and HPA Axis Suppression:** Although administered intralesionally, a fraction of the corticosteroid is invariably absorbed into the systemic circulation. Triamcinolone acetonide is a potent glucocorticoid. A sufficiently large systemic dose can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the body's endogenous steroid-regulating system. Chronic or high-dose suppression can lead to adrenal insufficiency and other systemic side effects of hypercortisolism. Establishing a total dose cap per session (e.g., $D_{\\max} = 20\\ \\mathrm{mg}$) is a critical safety measure to minimize the risk of clinically significant systemic effects, particularly HPA axis suppression.\n\nThus, the check confirms the treatment plan is not only mathematically sound but also adheres to fundamental principles of pharmacologic safety.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "4408413"}, {"introduction": "Hydroxychloroquine is a foundational systemic therapy for lymphocytic cicatricial alopecias, but its use carries a responsibility to mitigate the risk of irreversible retinopathy.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It requests a specific calculation for which all necessary data (patient weight and dose threshold) are provided, leading to a unique solution. It also requests a qualitative explanation of clinical practice (screening intervals) based on a logical, risk-stratification framework, which is also clearly defined.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is addressed in two parts as requested: the derivation of the maximum safe dose and the risk-based reasoning for ophthalmologic screening.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Maximum Safe Daily Dose**\n\nThe fundamental principle for calculating the maximum safe daily dose of hydroxychloroquine is to prevent exceeding the established toxicity threshold, which is given as a function of the patient's actual body weight.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{max}}$ represent the maximum safe daily dose in units of $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\nLet $W$ be the patient's actual body weight, given as $78\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nLet $T$ be the accepted safe dose threshold, given as $5\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$.\n\nThe relationship between these quantities is a direct proportion:\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = W \\times T$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = 78\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{day}}$$\n\nThe units of kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) cancel, yielding the dose in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$:\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = 390\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$$\n\nTherefore, the maximum daily dose of hydroxychloroquine that this patient can take while remaining within the accepted safe threshold is $390\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. Since hydroxychloroquine is typically available as $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ tablets, a common clinical practice would be to prescribe $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ daily, which is well below this threshold. A dose of $400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ daily would exceed the threshold and is therefore not recommended.\n\n**Part 2: Risk-Based Reasoning for Ophthalmologic Screening**\n\nThe rationale for screening intervals is based on risk stratification. The primary risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy are a daily dose exceeding $5\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$, duration of use greater than $5$ years, significant renal disease, concomitant tamoxifen use, and pre-existing macular disease.\n\n**Baseline and Follow-up for the Given Low-Risk Patient:**\nThe patient described in the problem is considered low-risk at the initiation of therapy for the following reasons:\n1.  The dose will be maintained at or below the calculated maximum safe dose of $390\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$ (i.e., $\\le 5\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$).\n2.  The patient has normal renal function.\n3.  The patient is not taking tamoxifen.\n4.  The patient has no preexisting retinal disease.\n\n- **Baseline Screening**: A baseline ophthalmologic examination is required for all patients within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine. The purpose is not to screen for toxicity, which has not had time to develop, but to document any pre-existing conditions of the macula and establish a baseline for both structural imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography, OCT) and functional testing (e.g., visual fields) against which future changes can be compared.\n\n- **Follow-up Screening**: For a low-risk patient, the cumulative risk of retinopathy remains very low (less than $1\\%$) for the first $5$ years of use. Therefore, after the baseline examination, no further annual screening is necessary during this initial period. The first follow-up screening should be performed after $5$ years of therapy. After the $5$-year mark, the risk begins to rise more significantly due to cumulative dose, and annual screening is recommended thereafter.\n\n**Changes in Screening for High-Risk Scenarios:**\nThe screening protocol must be intensified if major risk factors are present.\n\n1.  **Daily Dose > $5\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$**: If the patient's daily dose were to exceed the safe threshold (e.g., if a standard dose of $400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ were prescribed for this $78\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ patient, resulting in a dose of $\\approx 5.13\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$), this would classify the patient as high-risk from the beginning of therapy. In this case, annual screening should commence after the baseline examination and continue for the duration of treatment, starting from year $1$.\n\n2.  **Development of Renal Insufficiency**: Hydroxychloroquine is cleared by the kidneys. The development of significant renal disease (e.g., a glomerular filtration rate less than $60\\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73m^2}$) impairs drug clearance, leading to accumulation and increased systemic exposure. This effectively raises the risk profile to be equivalent to or greater than that of high-dose therapy. The patient would be re-stratified as high-risk, and annual screening would be initiated immediately, regardless of the duration of therapy.\n\n3.  **Introduction of Concomitant Tamoxifen**: Tamoxifen is an independent risk factor for maculopathy and has been shown to potentiate hydroxychloroquine toxicity, increasing the risk of retinopathy approximately five-fold. If the patient were to start tamoxifen, they would immediately be classified as high-risk. Annual ophthalmologic screening would be required, beginning from the first year of concurrent therapy.\n\nIn summary, the screening schedule is dynamically adjusted based on the patient's risk profile. The initial low-risk status justifies delaying annual screening for $5$ years, but the presence or development of any major risk factor mandates a shift to an immediate and ongoing annual screening protocol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{390}$$", "id": "4408396"}, {"introduction": "The management of neutrophilic cicatricial alopecias like folliculitis decalvans often requires a different therapeutic approach, targeting the associated microbial triggers with combination antibiotics.
