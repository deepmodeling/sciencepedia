This practice focuses on a common scenario in Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), where the goal is to predict the graft yield from a planned donor strip.

The provided values for follicular unit density, donor strip dimensions, and dissection loss are all within realistic clinical ranges. The problem requires a straightforward calculation based on core definitions and a qualitative explanation based on established anatomical and surgical principles.\n\nThe quantitative part of the problem asks for the expected number of harvestable follicular unit grafts. Let the donor follicular unit density be $\\rho$, the donor strip length be $L$, the donor strip width be $W$, and the fractional dissection loss be $f_{loss}$.\n\nThe given values are:\n$\\rho = 80 \\, \\text{units}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n$L = 24 \\, \\text{cm}$\n$W = 1.5 \\, \\text{cm}$\n$f_{loss} = 0.10$\n\nFirst, we calculate the area of the rectangular donor strip, denoted by $A$.

The fractional loss is given as $f_{loss} = 0.10$, which corresponds to a $10\\%$ loss. The fraction of units that are successfully preserved and become harvestable grafts is therefore $(1 - f_{loss})$. The expected net number of harvestable follicular unit grafts, $N_{net}$, is calculated by applying this success fraction to the gross yield.\n$$N_{net} = N_{gross} \\times (1 - f_{loss})$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$N_{net} = 2880 \\times (1 - 0.10)$$\n$$N_{net} = 2880 \\times 0.90$$\n$$N_{net} = 2592$$\nThe expected number of harvestable follicular unit grafts is $2592$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an explanation of how the bevel angle of a blade or punch influences the risk of follicular transection during donor harvesting.\n\nAnatomically, hair follicles are embedded within the dermis at an acute angle, so their emergence direction is not perpendicular to the scalp surface. To prevent follicular transection, which is the shearing of the follicle, the cutting plane of the surgical instrument must be aligned parallel to the hair follicle's longitudinal axis. The bevel of a blade or punch creates an angled cutting surface, and its orientation relative to the hair shaft's vector of emergence is critical; proper alignment ensures the incision path follows the follicle, while misalignment causes the cutting edge to intersect and damage it, compromising graft viability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2592}$$", "id": "4444500"}, {"introduction": "After determining the available supply of grafts, the surgical artist must design their placement to maximize cosmetic impact.

It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.

We begin by defining the primary variables based on the provided data.\nLet $A_{total} = 60\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$ be the total frontal area.\nLet $N_{total} = 2200$ be the total number of available follicular unit grafts.\nLet $A_{H} = 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$ be the area of the anterior hairline zone.\nThe area of the posterior frontal zone, $A_P$, is the remainder of the total area:\n$$A_{P} = A_{total} - A_{H} = 60\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 - 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\nThe ideal target density is $\\rho_{ideal} = 40\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, and the maximum safe density is $\\rho_{max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\n**Part 1: Achievable Uniform Density**\n\nThe goal is to determine the uniform density, $\\rho_{U}$, that can be achieved across the entire frontal area, $A_{total}$, given the graft limit, $N_{total}$. The total number of grafts required for a uniform density $\\rho_{U}$ is given by the product of the total area and the density:\n$$N_{required} = A_{total} \\times \\rho_{U}$$\nSince the number of grafts is limited to $N_{total}$, the highest achievable uniform density is found by using all available grafts:\n$$N_{total} = A_{total} \\times \\rho_{U}$$\nSolving for $\\rho_{U}$:\n$$\\rho_{U} = \\frac{N_{total}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{2200\\,\\mathrm{FU}}{60\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} = \\frac{110}{3}\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\nNumerically, this value is approximately $36.666...\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$. This density is below the vascular safety limit of $\\rho_{max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, so it is a valid plan.\nRounding to three significant figures, the achievable uniform density is:\n$$\\rho_{U} \\approx 36.7\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\n\n**Part 2: Gradient Density Plan**\n\nThis plan prioritizes the hairline zone. The steps are as follows:\nFirst, allocate grafts to the hairline zone ($A_H$) to achieve the ideal density, $\\rho_{ideal} = 40\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, subject to the vascular safety limit and the total graft limit. The ideal density of $40\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$ is less than the safety limit of $50\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, so the target is safe.\n\nNext, calculate the number of grafts required to achieve this ideal density in the hairline zone, $N_{H}$:\n$$N_{H} = A_{H} \\times \\rho_{ideal} = 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 \\times 40\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 800\\,\\mathrm{FU}$$\nCompare this required number of grafts with the total available supply:\n$$800\\,\\mathrm{FU} < 2200\\,\\mathrm{FU}$$\nSince the available supply ($N_{total}$) is greater than the amount needed for the hairline ($N_{H}$), it is possible to achieve the ideal density in the hairline zone. Thus, the density of the hairline zone, $\\rho_{H}$, is set to the ideal density:\n$$\\rho_{H} = \\rho_{ideal} = 40\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $40.0\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\nNow, calculate the number of remaining grafts, $N_{rem}$, to be distributed to the posterior frontal zone:\n$$N_{rem} = N_{total} - N_{H} = 2200\\,\\mathrm{FU} - 800\\,\\mathrm{FU} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{FU}$$\nThese remaining grafts are distributed uniformly over the posterior frontal zone area, $A_P = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$. The resulting density in the posterior zone, $\\rho_{P}$, is:\n$$\\rho_{P} = \\frac{N_{rem}}{A_{P}} = \\frac{1400\\,\\mathrm{FU}}{40\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} = 35\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\nThis density must also be checked against the vascular safety limit: $35\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2  50\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$. The plan is therefore safe.\nTo three significant figures, this density is $35.0\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\nThe final results for the three requested densities, all rounded to three significant figures, are:\n1.  Achievable uniform density: $36.7\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$\n2.  Hairline-zone density under the gradient plan: $40.0\\,\\mathrm{FU}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$\n3.
