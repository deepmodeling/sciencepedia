Consider the following foundational facts: (i) clinical dosing per unit body mass is designed so that the daily dose scales linearly with patient weight, (ii) for drugs with approximately first-order pharmacokinetics in the clinically relevant range, systemic exposure is proportional to dose, and (iii) inherited enzyme activity variation in thiopurine pathways modifies the risk profile, motivating genotype-based proportional reductions to achieve comparable exposure. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and Nudix Hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) genotypes are applied to adjust azathioprine starting doses. Assume a standard azathioprine dosing rate of $2$ milligrams per kilogram per day for a patient of body mass $70$ kilograms.

The metabolism of azathioprine is known to be significantly affected by genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (*TPMT*) and Nudix Hydrolase 15 (*NUDT15*). Dose adjustments based on genotype to mitigate toxicity risk (e.g., myelosuppression) are standard clinical practice.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of two genotype-adjusted doses based on a standard dosing regimen.\n\nFirst, we calculate the standard daily dose for the patient. Let $R_{std}$ be the standard dosing rate, and let $M$ be the patient's body mass. The standard daily dose, $D_{std}$, is the product of these two quantities.\n$$D_{std} = R_{std} \\times M$$\nThe given values are:\n- $R_{std} = 2 \\, \\text{mg/(kg} \\cdot \\text{day)}$\n- $M = 70 \\, \\text{kg}$\n\nSubstituting these values, we find the standard daily dose:\n$$D_{std} = 2 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 70 \\, \\text{kg} = 140 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the adjusted dose for a TPMT intermediate metabolizer. The problem states that this requires a reduction to $50\\%$ of the standard dose. Let this reduction factor be $F_{TPMT}$.\n$$F_{TPMT} = 50\\% = 0.5$$\nThe adjusted dose for the TPMT intermediate metabolizer, $D_{TPMT}$, is:\n$$D_{TPMT} = D_{std} \\times F_{TPMT}$$\n$$D_{TPMT} = 140 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}} \\times 0.5 = 70 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThen, we calculate the adjusted dose for a NUDT15 poor metabolizer. This requires a reduction to $10\\%$ of the standard dose. Let this reduction factor be $F_{NUDT15}$.\n$$F_{NUDT15} = 10\\% = 0.1$$\nThe adjusted dose for the NUDT15 poor metabolizer, $D_{NUDT15}$, is:\n$$D_{NUDT15} = D_{std} \\times F_{NUDT15}$$\n$$D_{NUDT15} = 140 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}} \\times 0.1 = 14 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be presented as a two-entry row matrix containing the exact values in the order (TPMT intermediate metabolizer dose, NUDT15 poor metabolizer dose). The two calculated doses are $70 \\, \\text{mg/day}$ and $14 \\, \\text{mg/day}$.

In a reference patient without increased metabolic capacity, the pharmacokinetic parameters are: absolute oral bioavailability $F=0.7$, dose $D=100$ mg every dosing interval $\\tau=12$ h, and systemic clearance $Cl=10$ L/h. Assume linear, time-invariant, one-compartment pharmacokinetics (PK) with first-order elimination and that steady state has been achieved with chronic multiple dosing.\n\n1) Starting from mass balance at steady state and the definition of clearance, derive an expression for the average steady-state concentration over the dosing interval, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$, in terms of $F$, $D$, $Cl$, and $\\tau$. Do not use any pre-memorized shortcut formulas; derive it from first principles that at steady state, average rate in equals average rate out and that clearance is defined as average elimination rate divided by concentration.\n\n2) Using your derived expression, compute the baseline $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$ for the reference patient.

If you choose to express $f$ as a decimal instead of an exact fraction, round to four significant figures.\n\nReport only the fold-change $f$ as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pharmacokinetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address each sequentially.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$.\n\nThe derivation is based on the principle of mass balance at steady state. At steady state, the average rate at which the drug enters the systemic circulation must equal the average rate at which it is eliminated from the body.\n\nLet the average rate of drug input into the systemic circulation be denoted as $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}}$ and the average rate of drug elimination be denoted as $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}}$. The steady-state condition is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}}\n$$\nThe drug is administered as an oral dose $D$ every dosing interval $\\tau$. The absolute oral bioavailability, $F$, is the fraction of the administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation. Therefore, the total amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation over one dosing interval is $F \\times D$. The average rate of input is this amount averaged over the dosing interval $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau}\n$$\nNext, we consider the rate of elimination. The problem instructs us to use the definition of systemic clearance, $Cl$. Clearance is defined as the proportionality constant that relates the rate of drug elimination to the drug concentration in plasma or blood. For an average rate of elimination and an average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$, this relationship is:\n$$\nCl = \\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}}}{C_{\\text{ss,avg}}}\n$$\nRearranging this definition to solve for the average rate of elimination gives:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}} = Cl \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}}\n$$\nNow, we equate the average rate in and the average rate out as per the steady-state principle:\n$$\n\\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau} = Cl \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}}\n$$\nSolving for the average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$, we arrive at the desired expression:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ss,avg}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{Cl \\times \\tau}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the baseline $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$ for the reference patient.\n\nWe use the expression derived in Part 1 and substitute the given parameters for the reference patient:\n- Absolute oral bioavailability, $F = 0.7$\n- Dose, $D = 100$ mg\n- Systemic clearance, $Cl = 10$ L/h\n- Dosing interval, $\\tau = 12$ h\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ss,avg,reference}} = \\frac{(0.7) \\times (100 \\text{ mg})}{(10 \\text{ L/h}) \\times (12 \\text{ h})}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{ss,avg,reference}} = \\frac{70 \\text{ mg}}{120 \\text{ L}} = \\frac{7}{12} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}}\n$$\nTo provide the numerical value as requested, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ss,avg,reference}} \\approx 0.5833 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Computation of the fold-change $f$.\n\nThe fold-change $f$ is defined as the ratio of the average steady-state concentration in the patient with the *CYP3A5* expressor genotype, $C_{\\text{ss,avg,genotype}}$, to that in the reference patient, $C_{\\text{ss,avg,reference}}$.\n$$\nf = \\frac{C_{\\text{ss,avg,genotype}}}{C_{\\text{ss,avg,reference}}}\n$$\nFor the patient with the genotype, the total body clearance is increased by $50\\%$. Let $Cl_{\\text{reference}}$ be the clearance of the reference patient and $Cl_{\\text{genotype}}$ be the clearance of the patient with the genotype. The relationship is:\n$$\nCl_{\\text{genotype}} = Cl_{\\text{reference}} + 0.50 \\times Cl_{\\text{reference}} = 1.5 \\times Cl_{\\text{reference}}\n$$\nAll other parameters ($F$, $D$, and $\\tau$) are stated to be unchanged. We can write the expressions for both concentrations using our derived formula:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ss,avg,reference}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{Cl_{\\text{reference}} \\times \\tau}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{ss,avg,genotype}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{Cl_{\\text{genotype}} \\times \\tau}\n$$\nNow, we construct the ratio for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\frac{F \\times D}{Cl_{\\text{genotype}} \\times \\tau}}{\\frac{F \\times D}{Cl_{\\text{reference}} \\times \\tau}}\n$$\nThe terms $F$, $D$, and $\\tau$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancel out.\n$$\nf = \\frac{F \\times D}{Cl_{\\text{genotype}} \\times \\tau} \\times \\frac{Cl_{\\text{reference}} \\times \\tau}{F \\times D} = \\frac{Cl_{\\text{reference}}}{Cl_{\\text{genotype}}}\n$$\nThis shows that the fold-change in steady-state concentration is inversely proportional to the fold-change in clearance. Substituting the relationship between the clearances:\n$$\nf = \\frac{Cl_{\\text{reference}}}{1.5 \\times Cl_{\\text{reference}}}\n$$\nThe term $Cl_{\\text{reference}}$ cancels, leaving:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{1.5}\n$$\nTo express this as a simplified exact fraction:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe fold-change $f$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "4471424"}, {"introduction": "The clinical utility of a pharmacogenomic test depends not only on its analytical accuracy but also on its performance within a specific population.
