Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the total systemically absorbed dose of the active drug and then to calculate its value for the specified scenario. We will begin by defining the relevant quantities symbolically and deriving the general expression from first principles.\n\nLet the following symbols represent the given quantities:\n- $w_d$: the mass fraction of the active drug in the formulation (dimensionless).\n- $D_f$: the applied dose of the formulation per unit area (mass/area).\n- $A$: the total application area (area).\n- $F$: the absolute bioavailability of the drug from the topical application (dimensionless).\n- $M_{abs}$: the total mass of the active drug that is systemically absorbed (mass).\n\nThe derivation proceeds in a sequence of logical steps based on the definitions of the input parameters.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total mass of the formulation applied, $M_f$.**\n    The dose of the formulation, $D_f$, is defined as the mass of formulation applied per unit area. Therefore, the total mass of formulation applied over an area $A$ is the product of the dose per unit area and the total area:\n    $$M_f = D_f \\times A$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the total mass of the active drug applied, $M_d$.**\n    The mass fraction of the drug, $w_d$, is defined as the ratio of the mass of the active drug to the total mass of the formulation. Thus, the total mass of the active drug applied to the skin is the product of its mass fraction and the total mass of the formulation applied:\n    $$M_d = w_d \\times M_f$$\n    Substituting the expression for $M_f$ from the first step gives:\n    $$M_d = w_d \\times D_f \\times A$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the total systemically absorbed mass of the drug, $M_{abs}$.**\n    The absolute bioavailability, $F$, is defined as the fraction of the applied active drug that reaches the systemic circulation. Therefore, the total mass of the drug absorbed systemically is the product of the bioavailability and the total mass of the drug applied:\n    $$M_{abs} = F \\times M_d$$\n    Substituting the in-progress expression for $M_d$ from the second step yields the final general expression for the total systemically absorbed dose:\n    $$M_{abs} = F \\times w_d \\times D_f \\times A$$\n    This is the general expression requested.\n\nNow, we will compute the numerical value for the scenario described. The given values are:\n- $w_d = 2\\% = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02$\n- $D_f = 2 \\, \\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$\n- $A = 500 \\, \\mathrm{cm^2}$\n- $F = 5\\% = \\frac{5}{100} = 0.05$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$M_{abs} = (0.05) \\times (0.02) \\times \\left(2 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{cm^2}}\\right) \\times (500 \\, \\mathrm{cm^2})$$\n\nTo perform the calculation, we can group the terms:\n$$M_{abs} = (0.05 \\times 0.02) \\times (2 \\times 500) \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\nFirst, calculate the product of the dimensionless fractions:\n$$0.05 \\times 0.02 = \\frac{5}{100} \\times \\frac{2}{100} = \\frac{10}{10000} = 0.001$$\nNext, calculate the product of the application terms:\n$$2 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{cm^2}} \\times 500 \\, \\mathrm{cm^2} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThis intermediate result, $1000 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$, represents the total mass of the formulation applied ($M_f$).\nNow, we combine these results to find $M_{abs}$:\n$$M_{abs} = (0.05 \\times 0.02) \\times 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$M_{abs} = 0.001 \\times 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$M_{abs} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nAlternatively, one can follow the derivation steps with numerical values:\n1.  Total mass of formulation applied: $M_f = D_f \\times A = 2 \\, \\mathrm{mg/cm^2} \\times 500 \\, \\mathrm{cm^2} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$.\n2.  Total mass of active drug applied: $M_d = w_d \\times M_f = 0.02 \\times 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mg} = 20 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$.\n3.  Total systemically absorbed mass: $M_{abs} = F \\times M_d = 0.05 \\times 20 \\, \\mathrm{mg} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nBoth calculation paths yield the same result. The expected total absorbed dose is exactly $1 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4492339"}, {"introduction": "When a drug is administered repeatedly, it accumulates until the rate of administration equals the rate of elimination, a condition known as steady state.

For regular dosing every $\\tau$, consider the steady-state peak immediately after a dose. Each prior dose contributes a residual concentration that has decayed over integer multiples of $\\tau$.

For a Janus kinase inhibitor in dermatologic indications, such fluctuation magnitude informs therapeutic window considerations, as efficacy and safety are tied to exposure; dosing interval matched to half-life ($\\tau = t_{1/2}$) yields $R=2$ and a trough that is half the peak, which may be acceptable or may prompt consideration of modified release or alternative intervals depending on pharmacodynamic requirements.

Upadacitinib is a real drug, its metabolism via CYP3A4 is established, and its interaction with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is a known and significant clinical issue. The described pharmacokinetic changes (decrease in clearance) are consistent with published drug-drug interaction studies. The described safety concerns (hematologic, hepatic, lipids, infections, thrombosis) are the well-documented class effects of JAK inhibitors. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient, consistent information to derive a dose adjustment. The objective is clearly defined: maintain steady-state exposure. Given the linear pharmacokinetics and the specified change in clearance, a unique dose adjustment can be calculated.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of bias or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). It is a realistic, formalizable clinical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Dose Adjustment\n\nThe clinical objective is to maintain the same steady-state drug exposure. For a drug with linear pharmacokinetics, exposure over a dosing interval, $\\tau$, is quantified by the area under the concentration-time curve at steady state, $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$. This is related to the dose, bioavailability ($F$), and clearance ($CL$) by the formula:\n$$ AUC_{\\tau,ss} = \\frac{F \\times Dose}{CL} $$\nThe dosing interval, $\\tau$, is constant (once daily, or 24 hours).\n\nLet the subscript $1$ denote the initial state (before the inhibitor) and the subscript $2$ denote the state during coadministration with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. The objective is to make the exposure in state $2$ equal to the exposure in state $1$:\n$$ AUC_{\\tau,ss,1} = AUC_{\\tau,ss,2} $$\nSubstituting the formula for $AUC$:\n$$ \\frac{F_1 \\times Dose_1}{CL_1} = \\frac{F_2 \\times Dose_2}{CL_2} $$\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following givens:\n-   $Dose_1 = 30 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$\n-   Bioavailability is unchanged: $F_1 = F_2$.\n-   Clearance decreases by $50\\%$: $CL_2 = (1 - 0.5) \\times CL_1 = 0.5 \\times CL_1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{F_1 \\times 30 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{CL_1} = \\frac{F_1 \\times Dose_2}{0.5 \\times CL_1} $$\nThe terms $F_1$ and $CL_1$ cancel out from both sides:\n$$ 30 \\, \\mathrm{mg} = \\frac{Dose_2}{0.5} $$\nSolving for $Dose_2$:\n$$ Dose_2 = 30 \\, \\mathrm{mg} \\times 0.5 = 15 \\, \\mathrm{mg} $$\nTherefore, to maintain the same steady-state exposure, the upadacitinib dose must be reduced by $50\\%$, from $30 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ once daily to $15 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ once daily.\n\nAlternatively, the problem states apparent oral clearance ($CL/F$) decreases by $50\\%$. The formula can be written as:\n$$ AUC_{\\tau,ss} = \\frac{Dose}{CL/F} $$\nSetting exposures equal:\n$$ \\frac{Dose_1}{(CL/F)_1} = \\frac{Dose_2}{(CL/F)_2} $$\nGiven $(CL/F)_2 = 0.5 \\times (CL/F)_1$:\n$$ \\frac{30 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{(CL/F)_1} = \\frac{Dose_2}{0.5 \\times (CL/F)_1} $$\n$$ 30 \\, \\mathrm{mg} = \\frac{Dose_2}{0.5} \\implies Dose_2 = 15 \\, \\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe derived dose adjustment is a reduction to $15 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ once daily.\n\n### Evaluation of the Monitoring Plan\nThe monitoring plan must address both underexposure and overexposure.\n-   **Underexposure:** Leads to loss of efficacy. This is monitored by assessing the clinical signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis (e.g., Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)).\n-   **Overexposure:** Increases the risk of adverse events associated with JAK inhibitors. Standard monitoring for upadacitinib includes:\n    1.  **Laboratory tests:** Complete Blood Count (CBC) for neutropenia, lymphopenia, and anemia; liver function tests (LFTs) for transaminase elevations; and a lipid panel for hyperlipidemia.\n    2.  **Clinical surveillance:** Vigilance for signs and symptoms of infection (especially viral reactivation like herpes zoster), thromboembolic events (DVT/PE), and other toxicities.\nThe problem states there is no TDM, so monitoring drug levels is not an option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reduce upadacitinib to $15 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ once daily...**\n-   **Dose Adjustment:** `Reduce upadacitinib to 15 mg once daily`. This is **correct**, as derived from pharmacokinetic principles.\n-   **Monitoring Plan:**\n    -   `monitor Complete Blood Count (CBC; lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, hemoglobin), liver transaminases, and fasting lipid panel`. This is a comprehensive and appropriate set of laboratory tests for JAK inhibitor safety.\n    -   `perform serial clinical assessments of atopic dermatitis control (including Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS))`. This correctly addresses monitoring for underexposure/loss of efficacy.\n    -   `intensify clinical vigilance for infections (including herpes zoster), thromboembolic events (Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary Embolism (PE)), and hepatic adverse events`. This correctly addresses clinical monitoring for toxicities associated with overexposure.\n    -   `titrate back to 30 mg once the inhibitor is discontinued`. This is a logical and necessary step to restore the original therapeutic regimen.\n-   **Verdict:** This option combines the correct, quantitatively derived dose adjustment with a comprehensive and clinically sound monitoring strategy that addresses all aspects of the clinical objective. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Continue upadacitinib at $30 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ once daily...**\n-   **Dose Adjustment:** `Continue ... at 30 mg once daily`. This is **incorrect**. It would double the patient's exposure, significantly increasing the risk of toxicity.\n-   **Monitoring Plan:** `institute weekly trough-level Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)`. This is **incorrect**, as it directly contradicts the given constraint that \"there is no clinically used Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) assay for upadacitinib\".\n-   **Rationale:** `routine laboratory monitoring is unnecessary because extended-release formulation blunts peak-related toxicity`. This is **incorrect** and dangerous. Toxicity is related to overall exposure ($AUC$), not just peak levels ($C_{max}$). Doubling the $AUC$ is a major safety concern regardless of the formulation.\n-   **Verdict:** This option is flawed in its dose, monitoring method, and rationale. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Reduce upadacitinib to $20 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ once daily...**\n-   **Dose Adjustment:** `Reduce ... to 20 mg once daily`. This is **incorrect**. As calculated, the correct dose is $15 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$. A $20 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ dose would still result in a $33.3\\%$ increase in exposure ($AUC_2/AUC_1 = (20/0.5)/30 = 40/30 \\approx 1.33$).\n-   **Monitoring Plan:** `monitor only alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) monthly`. This is **incorrect** as it is an incomplete plan. It dangerously ignores the significant hematologic, lipid, infectious, and thromboembolic risks of JAK inhibitors, all of which are exacerbated by overexposure.\n-   **Verdict:** The dose is wrong, and the monitoring plan is inadequate. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Reduce upadacitinib to $15 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ once daily...**\n-   **Dose Adjustment:** `Reduce ... to 15 mg once daily`. This dose is **correct**.\n-   **Monitoring Plan:** `if there are no symptoms within 2 weeks, discontinue further monitoring`. This is **incorrect** and clinically reckless. Many key toxicities (e.g., changes in blood counts, lipids) are asymptomatic and can only be detected by laboratory tests. Adverse events can also develop later than 2 weeks.\n-   **Rationale:** `because the extended-release formulation ensures stable concentrations`. This is **incorrect**. A stable concentration profile does not negate the risks of a chronically elevated average concentration (i.e., increased $AUC$).\n-   **Verdict:** While the dose is correct, the monitoring plan is dangerously insufficient. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Split-dose upadacitinib $10 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily...**\n-   **Dose Adjustment:** `Split-dose upadacitinib 10 mg twice daily`. The total daily dose is $20 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$. This is **incorrect** for the same reason as option C; it results in a $33.3\\%$ overexposure. Splitting the dose alters the peak-to-trough ratio but does not correct the total daily exposure.\n-   **Monitoring Plan:** `monitor C-reactive protein (CRP) every 2 weeks as a surrogate for overexposure`. This is **incorrect**. CRP is a marker of inflammation. JAK inhibition is anti-inflammatory, so it *causes* CRP to decrease. A falling CRP is a pharmacodynamic effect, not a surrogate for toxicity/overexposure. The proposed action, `increase the dose if CRP falls`, is the opposite of what would be logical and is nonsensical.\n-   **Verdict:** The dose is wrong, and the proposed monitoring biomarker and subsequent action are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the drug's mechanism. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4492360"}]}
