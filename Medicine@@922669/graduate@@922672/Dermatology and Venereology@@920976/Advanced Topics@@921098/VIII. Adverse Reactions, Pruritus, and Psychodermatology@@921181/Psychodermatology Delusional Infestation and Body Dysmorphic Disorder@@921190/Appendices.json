{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In psychodermatology, distinguishing true ectoparasitosis from Delusional Infestation (DI) represents a foundational diagnostic challenge. A clinician's initial assessment must be rigorously updated with objective data. This practice demonstrates the power of Bayesian inference as a formal method for quantifying diagnostic uncertainty, moving beyond a simple \"positive\" or \"negative\" test result to calculate a more informative posterior probability. Mastering this skill [@problem_id:4488909] is essential for interpreting diagnostic tests, such as dermoscopy, within the context of a patient's pre-test probability of true disease.", "problem": "An advanced psychodermatology clinic manages patients presenting with a fixed belief of ectoparasitic infestation. Clinic surveillance data indicate that the true prevalence of active Pediculus humanus capitis infestation among such referrals is $0.08$. A dermoscopy protocol used in the clinic has independently validated sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.92$ for detecting live lice or viable nits when performed by fellowship-trained dermatologists. A new patient with persistent infestation beliefs tests positive by dermoscopy. Treat the test as a single binary assay applied once, with performance characteristics stable across the clinic population, and assume the clinic prior reflects the patient’s pretest probability.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prior probability, derive the posterior probability of true lice infestation given the positive dermoscopy. Express the final posterior probability as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThen, using first principles reasoning grounded in probabilistic inference, explain how the computed posterior probability should influence whether to pursue additional parasitological confirmation (for example, repeat dermoscopy, wet combing with microscopy, or careful nit viability assessment) versus initiating structured psychiatric referral for delusional infestation (DI). Your explanation must articulate the logic without relying on any pre-specified decision thresholds, and should make explicit how evidence strength modifies the balance between further dermatologic testing and psychiatric evaluation. The final numeric answer must be given as a single real number as instructed above.", "solution": "Define the events and test characteristics mathematically. Let $D^{+}$ denote the presence of true lice infestation and $D^{-}$ its absence. Let $T^{+}$ denote a positive dermoscopy result and $T^{-}$ a negative result. The prior probability of disease is $P(D^{+})=p$, with $p=0.08$. The sensitivity is defined as $P(T^{+}\\,|\\,D^{+})=\\text{Se}$, with $\\text{Se}=0.90$. The specificity is defined as $P(T^{-}\\,|\\,D^{-})=\\text{Sp}$, with $\\text{Sp}=0.92$, so the false positive rate is $P(T^{+}\\,|\\,D^{-})=1-\\text{Sp}=0.08$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the posterior probability $P(D^{+}\\,|\\,T^{+})$, which by the law of total probability and Bayes’ rule can be derived from first principles.

The computed posterior probability is $0.4945$, which indicates that a single positive dermoscopy in this referral population raises the probability of true lice infestation from $0.08$ to approximately $0.49$—a substantial increase due to the positive likelihood ratio $\\text{LR}^{+}=11.25$, yet it stops short of near-certainty. In first principles terms, the evidence is strong enough to warrant additional dermatologic confirmation because:\n- The balance of possibilities remains roughly even ($\\approx 1:1$ odds), so the risk of acting on a false positive is nontrivial given potential psychosocial consequences and the psychodermatology context.\n- Low-risk, higher-yield confirmatory steps (for example, repeat dermoscopy by a second examiner, wet combing with careful microscopy, nit viability assessment) can materially sharpen the posterior by either adding concordant positive results (compounding likelihood ratios to push posterior probability closer to $1$) or producing discordant/negative findings that pull the probability down.\n\nConversely, immediate psychiatric referral for delusional infestation (DI) is premature when the posterior probability of a true medical infestation is near $0.50$ after a reasonably specific positive test. A judicious approach is to first pursue additional parasitological confirmation to resolve uncertainty. If subsequent high-quality assessments fail to corroborate infestation and the posterior probability drops well below a level at which medical infestation is plausible, the evidence base then shifts toward psychiatric etiologies (including delusional infestation and potentially body dysmorphic disorder), at which point structured psychiatric referral becomes appropriate. This sequence respects Bayesian evidence accumulation: test-driven updates guide whether further dermatologic testing or psychiatric evaluation is indicated, avoiding both missed infestations and premature psychologization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4945}$$", "id": "4488909"}, {"introduction": "Clinicians managing suspected DI often face the dilemma of whether to offer empiric antiparasitic treatment. While this may seem like a pragmatic choice, it carries risks, including reinforcing a patient's delusion and causing adverse effects.

By calculating the NNH [@problem_id:4488934], you will learn to quantify the risk-benefit balance of a treatment policy, a critical skill for making evidence-based decisions, especially in populations with a low prevalence of true disease.", "problem": "In a psychodermatology clinic serving patients with suspected ectoparasitic infestation, a common dilemma is whether to empirically prescribe permethrin to all patients with crawling or biting sensations, recognizing that many cases are delusional infestation rather than true arthropod infestation. Suppose that among such patients the prevalence of true infestation is $0.02$. Consider a policy of empiric treatment with topical permethrin for all patients at first presentation. Let the adverse event of interest be any clinically significant dermatitis attributable to permethrin over a short, defined horizon in which spontaneous resolution of dermatitis is negligible without exposure to permethrin. Empirically, the probability of permethrin-attributable dermatitis in a treated individual is $0.10$. Assume that this probability does not depend on whether the individual has a true infestation.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of absolute risk difference and the number needed to harm (NNH), derive the expected NNH for the adverse event defined above under this empiric-treatment policy. Express the final NNH as an exact value with no units.\n\nThen, using the same inputs and only the bound that the probability of clinical benefit among truly infested individuals lies in $[0,1]$ over the same horizon, briefly justify in your working whether the expected benefits can outweigh the expected harms in this cohort under empiric treatment. The final numerical answer you provide must be only the NNH.", "solution": "Let $I$ be the event that a patient has a true infestation, and $I^c$ be the event that a patient does not have a true infestation (e.g., delusional infestation).\nLet $T$ be the event that a patient is treated with permethrin. Under the empiric-treatment policy, every patient is treated.\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient develops the adverse event, which is permethrin-attributable dermatitis.\n\nFrom the givens, we have:\n- The prevalence of true infestation: $P(I) = 0.02$.\n- The prevalence of no true infestation: $P(I^c) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\n- The probability of dermatitis, given treatment: $P(D|T) = 0.10$.\n- The problem states this probability is independent of infestation status, which means $P(D|T, I) = P(D|T, I^c) = 0.10$.\n\nThe problem asks for the Number Needed to Harm (NNH), derived from the Absolute Risk Difference. The Absolute Risk Difference for a harmful outcome is typically defined as the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI).\n\n$$ARI = R_{\\text{exposed}} - R_{\\text{unexposed}}$$\n\nwhere $R_{\\text{exposed}}$ is the risk of the adverse event in the group exposed to the intervention, and $R_{\\text{unexposed}}$ is the risk in the unexposed group.\n\nThe Number Needed to Harm is the reciprocal of the ARI, provided $ARI > 0$.\n\n$$NNH = \\frac{1}{ARI}$$\n\nUnder the proposed policy, the \"exposed\" group consists of all patients presenting with the symptoms, as they are all treated. The risk of the adverse event (dermatitis) in this exposed population is given directly.\n$$R_{\\text{exposed}} = P(D|T) = 0.10$$\n\nThe \"unexposed\" group is the hypothetical control group of the same patients who are not treated. The problem states that \"spontaneous resolution of dermatitis is negligible without exposure to permethrin\". This phrasing means that the specific adverse event, permethrin-attributable dermatitis, cannot occur without permethrin exposure. Therefore, the risk of this specific adverse event in the unexposed group is zero.\n$$R_{\\text{unexposed}} = 0$$\n\nNow, we calculate the ARI for the entire cohort under this policy.\n$$ARI = R_{\\text{exposed}} - R_{\\text{unexposed}} = 0.10 - 0 = 0.10$$\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected* NNH. Since the risk of harm is stated to be independent of infestation status ($P(D|T,I) = P(D|T,I^c) = 0.10$), the ARI is identical for both the infested and non-infested subgroups. Consequently, the NNH is the same for any patient in the cohort, regardless of their true diagnosis. The NNH for the population is not an expectation over different values but a single, constant value.\n$$NNH = \\frac{1}{ARI} = \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10$$\nThis means that for every $10$ patients treated empirically with permethrin, one additional case of dermatitis is expected to occur compared to not treating them.\n\nNext, we address the benefit-harm balance. The final answer should only contain the NNH, but the justification is required in the working.\n\n**Benefit-Harm Analysis:**\nThe harm of the policy accrues to the entire treated population. The benefit, however, can only accrue to the subgroup of patients with a true infestation.\n\n- **Expected Harm:** For every $100$ patients treated, the expected number of patients developing dermatitis is:\n$$N_{\\text{harm}} = 100 \\times R_{\\text{exposed}} = 100 \\times 0.10 = 10$$\n\n- **Expected Benefit:** The benefit (cure of infestation) is only possible for the $2\\%$ of patients who are truly infested. Let $p_B$ be the probability of clinical benefit for a treated, truly infested individual. The problem states $p_B \\in [0, 1]$.\nFor every $100$ patients treated, the number of truly infested patients is:\n$$N_{\\text{infested}} = 100 \\times P(I) = 100 \\times 0.02 = 2$$\nThe expected number of patients who experience a clinical benefit is:\n$$N_{\\text{benefit}} = N_{\\text{infested}} \\times p_B = 2 \\times p_B$$\nSince $p_B \\le 1$, the maximum possible number of patients who benefit per $100$ treated is $2$.\n\n- **Comparison:** For every $100$ patients subjected to the empiric treatment policy, we expect $10$ cases of harm (dermatitis) while expecting at most $2$ cases of benefit (cure of infestation). The ratio of harms to the best-case-scenario benefits is at least $10/2 = 5$. Thus, the expected harms of this empiric-treatment policy substantially outweigh the maximum possible expected benefits. A more nuanced approach using Number Needed to Treat (NNT) confirms this. The population NNT is $NNT_{pop} = \\frac{1}{P(I) \\times p_B}$. In the best case ($p_B=1$), $NNT_{pop} = \\frac{1}{0.02 \\times 1} = 50$. Comparing $NNT_{pop, min} = 50$ with $NNH = 10$ shows that one must treat $50$ people to achieve one benefit, while only $10$ must be treated to cause one harm. The policy is clearly unfavorable.\n\nThe derived NNH is $10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "4488934"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of Delusional Infestation is the presentation of \"specimens\"—bits of skin, debris, or fibers that the patient believes are parasites.
