The context of phototoxic drug reactions is a valid and established application area in dermatology and photobiology. The provided values for the extinction coefficient, concentration, and pathlength are physically realistic for such a scenario. The units require conversion but are dimensionally consistent. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive a unique solution. It is free from ambiguity and subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem asks for a derivation starting from the \"base-ten definition of absorbance\" and the \"fundamental definition of attenuation\". This is embodied in the Beer-Lambert law. Let $I_0$ be the incident intensity of the UVA radiation and $I(l)$ be the intensity transmitted through the layer of thickness $l$.\n\nThe absorbance, $A$, is defined in base-ten logarithm as:\n$$A = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I(l)}\\right)$$\nThe Beer-Lambert law states that absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration $c$ of the absorbing species and the pathlength $l$ of the medium. The constant of proportionality is the molar decadic extinction coefficient, $\\epsilon$.\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\nCombining these two equations gives a relationship between the transmitted and incident intensities:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I(l)}\\right) = \\epsilon c l$$\nThe fraction of light that is transmitted through the sample is the transmittance, $T$, defined as:\n$$T = \\frac{I(l)}{I_0}$$\nWe can relate absorbance and transmittance:\n$$A = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) = -\\log_{10}(T)$$\nSolving for transmittance $T$ in terms of absorbance $A$:\n$$T = 10^{-A}$$\nSubstituting the Beer-Lambert law expression for $A$:\n$$T = 10^{-\\epsilon c l}$$\nThe fraction of incident radiation that is absorbed, $F_{abs}$, is the complement of the fraction that is transmitted. The total intensity is partitioned into absorbed, transmitted, and scattered/reflected components. With scattering and reflection being negligible as per the problem statement, we have:\n$$I_0 = I_{abs} + I(l)$$\nwhere $I_{abs}$ is the absorbed intensity.\nThe fraction absorbed is therefore:\n$$F_{abs} = \\frac{I_{abs}}{I_0} = \\frac{I_0 - I(l)}{I_0} = 1 - \\frac{I(l)}{I_0} = 1 - T$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T$ in terms of $\\epsilon$, $c$, and $l$ yields the desired expression for the fraction of absorbed radiation:\n$$F_{abs} = 1 - 10^{-\\epsilon c l}$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the given values.\nThe concentration $c$ must be converted from micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) to molar ($\\mathrm{M}$) to be dimensionally consistent with the units of $\\epsilon$.\n$$c = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe other values are:\n$$\\epsilon = 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$l = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\nFirst, we calculate the unitless absorbance, $A$:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l = (10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{M}) \\times (0.05\\ \\mathrm{cm})$$\n$$A = 10^{4} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 5 \\times 10^{-2} = 5 \\times 10^{(4 - 5 - 2)} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$A = 0.005$$\nNow, we calculate the fraction absorbed, $F_{abs}$:\n$$F_{abs} = 1 - 10^{-A} = 1 - 10^{-0.005}$$\nUsing a calculator for the numerical value:\n$$10^{-0.005} \\approx 0.98855309$$\n$$F_{abs} \\approx 1 - 0.98855309 = 0.01144691$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit, which is the $1$ in the hundredths place. The first four significant digits are $1$, $1$, $4$, $4$. The fifth significant digit is $6$. Since $6 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$F_{abs} \\approx 0.01145$$\nThis is the final numerical fraction of incident UVA absorbed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01145}$$", "id": "4476557"}, {"introduction": "Moving from molecular absorption to clinical practice requires quantifying the dose of ultraviolet radiation delivered to a patient's skin.

He reports onset of erythema within $6$ to $12$ hours after $1$ to $2$ hours of midday sun exposure and denies new topical products. His medications include amiodarone $200$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$ for $6$ months, atorvastatin $20$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$, and lisinopril $10$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$. Physical examination shows sharply demarcated erythema on the forehead, dorsal forearms, and V of the neck, with mild edema but no vesiculation or systemic symptoms.\n\nPhototesting results from a standardized unit show: Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) for ultraviolet B (UVB) is $60$ $\\mathrm{mJ/cm^2}$ (laboratory reference range $40$ to $80$ $\\mathrm{mJ/cm^2}$ for Fitzpatrick skin type II). The threshold for ultraviolet A (UVA)-induced erythema is $6$ $\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$ (laboratory reference range $20$ to $30$ $\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$). A comprehensive photopatch test panel including $30$ standard photoallergens and the patient’s personal sunscreen was negative at $48$ hours after irradiation with UVA $5$ $\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$.\n\nFundamental bases for interpretation include: the definition of UVA as electromagnetic radiation in the $320$ to $400$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ range and UVB in the $280$ to $320$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ range; the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) as the lowest radiant exposure that produces just-perceptible erythema at $24$ hours; the concept that phototoxic reactions are non-immunologic, dose-dependent responses occurring in any individual given sufficient photosensitizer and light, typically with action spectra in the UVA range; and that photoallergic reactions are delayed-type ($\\mathrm{Type\\ IV}$) hypersensitivity requiring prior sensitization, usually demonstrated by positive photopatch testing.\n\nWhich option best integrates the data to identify the mechanism and guide immediate management?\n\nA. Conclude photoallergic dermatitis and continue amiodarone; treat with medium-potency topical corticosteroids and rely on avoidance of suspected topical allergens without changing systemic therapy.\n\nB.

Conclude irritant contact dermatitis; stop fragranced soaps and emollients, continue all medications, and do not modify sun protection practices beyond routine SPF $30$ use.", "solution": "Begin from the fundamental definitions and well-tested observations relevant to photodermatoses:\n\n1. Ultraviolet A (UVA) is electromagnetic radiation in the $320$ to $400$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ band; ultraviolet B (UVB) is $280$ to $320$ $\\mathrm{nm}$. UVA penetrates more deeply into the dermis and is less erythemogenic per unit radiant exposure than UVB, but many photosensitizing drugs have absorption spectra aligned with UVA.\n\n2. The Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) is the lowest radiant exposure that causes just-perceptible erythema at $24$ hours. A normal UVB MED indicates intact baseline UVB erythemal response, whereas a reduced threshold for UVA-induced erythema indicates increased sensitivity within the UVA action spectrum.\n\n3. Phototoxic reactions are non-immunologic, dose-dependent phenomena: given sufficient photosensitizer concentration and light exposure, reactive oxygen species and excited-state chemistry lead to direct cellular damage. They typically occur within hours after exposure, can affect any individual, are often driven by UVA, and do not require prior sensitization. There is no need for a positive photopatch test.\n\n4. Photoallergic reactions are immunologic delayed-type ($\\mathrm{Type\\ IV}$) hypersensitivity responses requiring prior sensitization to a chemical that becomes antigenic upon photoactivation. They often present as eczematous dermatitis with latency of $24$ to $72$ hours, and are supported by positive photopatch testing to the offending agent under UVA irradiation. The response is not simply a reduced global UVA erythema threshold; instead, it is a specific T-cell mediated reaction to the photoallergen.\n\nApply these bases to the given data:\n\n- The patient’s UVB MED is $60$ $\\mathrm{mJ/cm^2}$, within the laboratory reference range ($40$ to $80$ $\\mathrm{mJ/cm^2}$), indicating normal UVB sensitivity.\n- The UVA-induced erythema threshold is $6$ $\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$, substantially lower than the laboratory reference ($20$ to $30$ $\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$), indicating heightened sensitivity specifically in the UVA range, which aligns with the action spectra of many photosensitizing drugs (amiodarone is known to absorb within UVA and visible ranges and to cause phototoxicity).\n- The clinical onset within $6$ to $12$ hours after sun exposure is consistent with phototoxic timing.\n- The photopatch test is negative across $30$ standard photoallergens and the patient’s sunscreen after UVA $5$ $\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$ irradiation, arguing against photoallergy to tested topicals; photoallergy to a systemic agent is uncommon and would require targeted testing that is not suggested by these data.\n- The distribution is sharply photodistributed without systemic features, typical of drug phototoxicity.\n\nTherefore, the integrated interpretation is a UVA-driven phototoxic drug reaction, most plausibly attributable to amiodarone. Immediate management grounded in first principles includes reducing the photosensitizer-light interaction: minimize UVA exposure, use broad-spectrum sunscreens with high UVA protection (for example, high Persistent Pigment Darkening rating), sun-protective clothing, and consider removal or substitution of the photosensitizing agent. Because amiodarone is clinically important, coordination with cardiology to substitute with a lower-photosensitizing antiarrhythmic (for example, dronedarone, acknowledging distinct efficacy/safety profiles and contraindications) is the appropriate drug-change strategy.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option asserts photoallergic dermatitis and proposes continuing amiodarone with topical corticosteroids and avoidance of topical allergens. The negative photopatch test after UVA irradiation argues against photoallergy to tested topicals. Moreover, the reduced global UVA erythema threshold and rapid onset within hours are characteristic of phototoxicity, not delayed-type photoallergy. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. This option identifies a UVA-driven phototoxic reaction and recommends broad-spectrum measures emphasizing UVA protection plus cardiology consultation to substitute amiodarone for a less photosensitizing alternative. This integrates the normal UVB MED, reduced UVA threshold, negative photopatch, and timing/distribution, and addresses the dose-dependent non-immunologic mechanism through both photoprotection and removal of the photosensitizer. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. Polymorphic light eruption often presents with pruritic papules/plaques and delayed onset after sun exposure, with phototesting sometimes normal or showing distinctive provocation rather than a globally lowered UVA threshold. The strong temporal association with a known photosensitizing drug and reduced UVA threshold favors drug phototoxicity; NB-UVB photohardening does not address the culprit photosensitizer and may be contraindicated or ineffective in the setting of active phototoxicity. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option concludes photoallergy to a sunscreen component despite a negative photopatch test and recommends SPF-focused UVB protection without specific UVA measures. Sun Protection Factor (SPF) primarily quantifies UVB protection; for UVA-driven reactions, high UVA protection is critical. The premise contradicts test results and misdirects management away from the dominant UVA action spectrum. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Irritant contact dermatitis does not explain photodistribution, the light-dose dependence, or the reduced UVA threshold on phototesting. Stopping soaps while maintaining the photosensitizing drug and minimal sun protection ignores the demonstrated mechanism. Verdict: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4476553"}]}
