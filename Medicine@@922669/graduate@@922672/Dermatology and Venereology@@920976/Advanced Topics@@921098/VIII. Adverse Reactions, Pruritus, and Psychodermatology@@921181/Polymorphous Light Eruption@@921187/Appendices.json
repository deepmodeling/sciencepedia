The formula states that the posterior odds of a hypothesis are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio of the evidence.\n\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio} $$\n\nLet $H$ be the hypothesis that the patient has polymorphous light eruption (PMLE).

Soda-lime glass has $T(\\lambda)\\approx 0$ across UVB ($\\lambda<320\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) but substantial $T(\\lambda)$ across UVA ($\\lambda\\ge 320\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) because $T(\\lambda)=e^{-\\alpha(\\lambda)L}$ with $\\alpha(\\lambda)$ large in UVB and small in UVA.

The descriptions of the action spectra for PMLE (peaking in UVA) and erythema (peaking in UVB) are consistent with dermatological literature. The transmission characteristics of common soda-lime glass are also accurately portrayed. The problem is well-posed, providing a quantitative model and a specific scenario to explain. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no internal contradictions; the provided data and models are sufficient to construct a logical explanation for the observed phenomenon. The problem is not trivial, as it requires the synthesis of multiple concepts (source spectrum, filter transmission, and biological response function).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe central task is to explain why $D_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}$ can reach its threshold $H_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}$ while $D_{\\mathrm{ery}}$ does not reach its threshold $H_{\\mathrm{ery}}$ under the described conditions. We must analyze the integral for the dose, $D_X(t)=\\int_{\\lambda} I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_X(\\lambda)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\lambda\\cdot t$.\n\nThe magnitude of the dose depends on the product of three functions within the integral, often called the \"biologically effective spectral irradiance\": $I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_X(\\lambda)$. For the integral to accumulate a significant value, there must be a spectral region where all three functions are simultaneously non-negligible.\n\n1.  **Analysis for PMLE ($X = \\mathrm{PMLE}$):**\n    -   $I_0(\\lambda)$: The solar spectrum is present across the UVA range ($320\\text{–}400\\,\\mathrm{nm}$).\n    -   $T(\\lambda)$: The glass transmission is substantial ($T(\\lambda) \\approx 0.5\\text{–}0.8$) in the UVA range.\n    -   $S_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(\\lambda)$: The action spectrum for PMLE is maximal in the UVA range.\n    \n    There is a significant overlap of these three functions in the UVA band. The integrand $I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(\\lambda)$ is therefore significantly greater than zero over the UVA portion of the spectrum. The integral $\\int_{\\mathrm{UVA}} I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(\\lambda)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\lambda$ will yield a substantial positive value. Given enough time $t$, the dose $D_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(t)$ can accumulate and exceed the threshold $H_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}$, triggering the PMLE reaction. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n\n2.  **Analysis for Erythema ($X = \\mathrm{ery}$):**\n    -   $I_0(\\lambda)$: The solar spectrum is present across the UVB range ($290\\text{–}320\\,\\mathrm{nm}$).\n    -   $S_{\\mathrm{ery}}(\\lambda)$: The action spectrum for erythema is maximal in the UVB range.\n    -   $T(\\lambda)$: The glass transmission is near-zero ($T(\\lambda) \\approx 0$) in the UVB range.\n    \n    In the UVB range, where $S_{\\mathrm{ery}}(\\lambda)$ is largest, the transmission $T(\\lambda)$ acts as a blocking filter. The product $I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_{\\mathrm{ery}}(\\lambda)$ is approximately zero throughout the entire UVB band.\n    In the UVA range, $T(\\lambda)$ is high, but $S_{\\mathrm{ery}}(\\lambda)$ is stated to decrease rapidly and is very small compared to its UVB peak. Therefore, the product $I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_{\\mathrm{ery}}(\\lambda)$ is also very small in the UVA band.\n    \n    Since the integrand is negligible across both the UVB and UVA ranges, the total integral $\\int_{\\lambda} I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_{\\mathrm{ery}}(\\lambda)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\lambda$ will be very close to zero. Consequently, the dose $D_{\\mathrm{ery}}(t)$ will not reach the threshold $H_{\\mathrm{ery}}$, and no sunburn will occur. This is also consistent with the observation.\n\nThe physical reason for the transmission behavior is the Beer–Lambert law, $T(\\lambda)=e^{-\\alpha(\\lambda)L}$. The sharp drop in transmission in the UVB region implies that the attenuation coefficient $\\alpha(\\lambda)$ of soda-lime glass is very large for $\\lambda < 320\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, leading to strong absorption. Conversely, the high transmission in the UVA implies that $\\alpha(\\lambda)$ is much smaller for $\\lambda \\ge 320\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Soda-lime glass has $T(\\lambda)\\approx 0$ across UVB ($\\lambda<320\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) but substantial $T(\\lambda)$ across UVA ($\\lambda\\ge 320\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) because $T(\\lambda)=e^{-\\alpha(\\lambda)L}$ with $\\alpha(\\lambda)$ large in UVB and small in UVA. Since $S_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(\\lambda)$ is concentrated in UVA, the integrand $I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(\\lambda)$ remains nonzero over $320\\text{–}400\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, allowing $D_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(t)$ to reach $H_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}$ during window-side exposure. In contrast, $S_{\\mathrm{ery}}(\\lambda)$ is concentrated in UVB where $T(\\lambda)\\approx 0$, so $I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_{\\mathrm{ery}}(\\lambda)$ is negligible and $D_{\\mathrm{ery}}(t)\\ll H_{\\mathrm{ery}}$, preventing an erythemal response.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with the derivation above. It correctly identifies the filtering property of the glass, linking it to the attenuation coefficient via the Beer-Lambert law. It correctly analyzes the overlap between the transmitted spectrum and the respective action spectra for both PMLE and erythema, and correctly concludes why one dose can reach its threshold while the other cannot. The reasoning is complete, and all statements are consistent with the problem's premises and established principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. UVA photons have lower energy $E=h c/\\lambda$ than UVB photons, so more UVA photons are present at a given power. This higher photon count behind glass guarantees $D_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(t)\\ge H_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}$, whereas the higher-energy requirement of UVB-mediated endpoints cannot be met indoors; thus PMLE occurs but erythema does not.**\nThe initial statement about photon energy is correct. However, the reasoning that follows is flawed. A higher photon count for a given power does not \"guarantee\" a biological effect; the effectiveness of each photon, described by the action spectrum $S(\\lambda)$, is crucial. The most significant error is the claim that the \"higher-energy requirement of UVB-mediated endpoints cannot be met\". The issue is not that the energy per photon is insufficient; it's that the photons themselves are absent, having been blocked by the glass. The argument mischaracterizes the core mechanism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Soda-lime glass down-converts UVB into visible light via fluorescence, and PMLE is primarily triggered by visible light; UVB-mediated conditions require intact UVB and therefore cannot occur behind glass.**\nThis option contains multiple factual errors relative to the problem statement. First, it posits that PMLE is triggered by visible light, which directly contradicts the given premise that its action spectrum, $S_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(\\lambda)$, is concentrated in the UVA band. Second, while some materials fluoresce, the primary reason for near-zero UVB transmission in soda-lime glass is absorption, not down-conversion. This option introduces mechanisms and facts inconsistent with the provided model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. PMLE is caused by infrared heating rather than ultraviolet exposure, and soda-lime glass transmits infrared, whereas UVB-mediated conditions strictly require UVB; therefore PMLE can occur behind glass but UVB endpoints cannot.**\nThis option is fundamentally incorrect as it misidentifies the cause of PMLE. The problem explicitly defines PMLE as an ultraviolet-induced phenomenon with a specific action spectrum $S_{\\mathrm{PMLE}}(\\lambda)$ in the UVA range. Attributing it to infrared heating is a direct contradiction of the problem's premises and of established medical science concerning photodermatoses.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4481986"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of Polymorphous Light Eruption hinges on adequate photoprotection, which requires a quantitative understanding of sunscreen performance against the specific triggering wavelengths.
