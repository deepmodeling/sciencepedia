This exercise will guide you through the process of calculating fundamental performance metrics—sensitivity, specificity, and the positive likelihood ratio—from study data. By applying these core epidemiological definitions to the “dot-in-circle” sign in mycetoma, you will develop a crucial skill for critically appraising the diagnostic value of clinical findings [@problem_id:4499287].", "problem": "An imaging sign known as the “dot-in-circle” is commonly reported in musculoskeletal imaging of tropical infections and has been associated with mycetoma. Consider a prospective imaging study conducted in a tropical dermatology clinic where a total of $120$ patients with clinically suspected mycetoma underwent standardized imaging. Subsequent definitive diagnosis was established by histopathology and culture. Among the $120$ patients, $80$ were confirmed to have mycetoma and $40$ were confirmed not to have mycetoma. The “dot-in-circle” sign was present in $70$ of the $80$ confirmed mycetoma cases and in $4$ of the $40$ non-mycetoma cases.\n\nStarting from the core epidemiological definitions of test performance rooted in conditional probability, compute the sensitivity, specificity, and the positive likelihood ratio for the “dot-in-circle” sign. Express each quantity as a decimal (for sensitivity and specificity) or as a real number (for the likelihood ratio). Round each value to four significant figures. No units are required in your final expressions.", "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data from a hypothetical clinical study to assess the performance of a diagnostic sign. The terms used—sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio—are standard, well-defined metrics in epidemiology and biostatistics. The data is internally consistent and allows for a unique solution.\n\nLet $D$ represent the event that a patient has confirmed mycetoma (the disease is present), and let $D^c$ represent the event that a patient does not have mycetoma (the disease is absent).\nLet $T$ represent the event that the “dot-in-circle” sign is present (a positive test result), and let $T^c$ represent the event that the sign is absent (a negative test result).\n\nThe problem provides the following absolute counts:\n- The total number of patients with mycetoma is $N_D = 80$.\n- The total number of patients without mycetoma is $N_{D^c} = 40$.\n- The total number of patients in the study is $N = N_D + N_{D^c} = 80 + 40 = 120$.\n\nFrom this, we can determine the counts for the four possible outcomes:\n- True Positives (TP): Patients with the disease and a positive test. The problem states this is $n(T \\cap D) = 70$.\n- False Positives (FP): Patients without the disease but with a positive test. The problem states this is $n(T \\cap D^c) = 4$.\n- False Negatives (FN): Patients with the disease but a negative test. This can be calculated as the total number of diseased patients minus the true positives: $n(T^c \\cap D) = N_D - n(T \\cap D) = 80 - 70 = 10$.\n- True Negatives (TN): Patients without the disease and a negative test. This can be calculated as the total number of non-diseased patients minus the false positives: $n(T^c \\cap D^c) = N_{D^c} - n(T \\cap D^c) = 40 - 4 = 36$.\n\nThese counts can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n             & D          & D^c          & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\nT            & 70 \\text{ (TP)} & 4 \\text{ (FP)} & 74 \\\\\nT^c          & 10 \\text{ (FN)} & 36 \\text{ (TN)} & 46 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & 80         & 40           & 120\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe can now compute the required diagnostic test metrics based on their fundamental definitions rooted in conditional probability.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity**\n    Sensitivity, also known as the True Positive Rate (TPR), is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. It is formally expressed as the conditional probability $P(T|D)$.\n    $$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T|D) = \\frac{n(T \\cap D)}{n(D)} = \\frac{n(\\text{TP})}{n(\\text{TP}) + n(\\text{FN})} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{70}{80} = 0.875 $$\n    As required, we round this to four significant figures, which is $0.8750$.\n\n2.  **Specificity**\n    Specificity, also known as the True Negative Rate (TNR), is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. It is formally expressed as the conditional probability $P(T^c|D^c)$.\n    $$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T^c|D^c) = \\frac{n(T^c \\cap D^c)}{n(D^c)} = \\frac{n(\\text{TN})}{n(\\text{TN}) + n(\\text{FP})} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{36}{40} = 0.9 $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.9000$.\n\n3.  **Positive Likelihood Ratio ($LR^{+}$)**\n    The Positive Likelihood Ratio is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual. It is the ratio of the True Positive Rate to the False Positive Rate (FPR).\n    $$ LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|D^c)} $$\n    The numerator, $P(T|D)$, is the sensitivity. The denominator, $P(T|D^c)$, is the False Positive Rate. The FPR is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{FPR} = P(T|D^c) = \\frac{n(T \\cap D^c)}{n(D^c)} = \\frac{n(\\text{FP})}{n(\\text{TN}) + n(\\text{FP})} = \\frac{4}{40} = 0.1 $$\n    Note that the FPR is also equal to $1 - \\text{Specificity}$, which is $1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\n    Therefore, the $LR^{+}$ is:\n    $$ LR^{+} = \\frac{\\text{Sensitivity}}{\\text{FPR}} = \\frac{0.875}{0.1} = 8.75 $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $8.750$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8750 & 0.9000 & 8.750 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4499287"}, {"introduction": "After establishing a diagnosis, quantifying the severity of a disease like mycetoma is essential for prognosis and for tailoring the intensity of treatment. This practice demonstrates how complex clinical presentations can be translated into a standardized, numerical score by creating a composite severity index.

For a drug with linear kinetics, $\\bar{C}_{ss}$ is directly proportional to the dosing rate and inversely proportional to the total body clearance ($CL_{total}$). The dosing rate is the dose ($Dose$) administered per dosing interval ($\\tau$).
