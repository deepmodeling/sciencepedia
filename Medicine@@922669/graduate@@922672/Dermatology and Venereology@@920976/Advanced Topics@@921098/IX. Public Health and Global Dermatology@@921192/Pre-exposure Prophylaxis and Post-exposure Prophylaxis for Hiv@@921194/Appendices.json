The task is a direct application of a standard medical formula, the Cockcroft-Gault equation, to determine a patient's estimated creatinine clearance ($CrCl$) and subsequently decide on their eligibility for a specific medication based on a given threshold.\n\nThe Cockcroft-Gault equation is used to estimate creatinine clearance. The general form of the equation is:\n$$ CrCl = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{72 \\times SCr} $$\nwhere age is in years, weight is in kilograms ($kg$), and a patient's serum creatinine ($SCr$) is in milligrams per deciliter ($mg/dL$).\n\nThe problem specifies that the patient is a cisgender woman, for whom a correction factor of $0.85$ must be applied.

The standard of care for non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is to initiate antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible within $72$ hours after an exposure and to continue the full course for $28$ consecutive days.

It is based on established clinical guidelines for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), provides sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated as a solvable quantitative problem. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires calculating the cumulative PEP coverage for a patient with multiple HIV exposures and explaining the management of the PEP course in terms of restarts versus extensions.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total duration of the PEP course based on the provided timeline and rules.\nLet the times of the four exposures be denoted by $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, and $T_4$. The given values are:\n- $T_1 = 0$ days\n- $T_2 = 3.2$ days\n- $T_3 = 16.5$ days\n- $T_4 = 27.4$ days\n\nThe patient initiates PEP at time $T_{\\text{start}} = 0.75$ days. This is within the $72$-hour ($3$-day) window following the first exposure at $T_1=0$, as required.\n\nThe core rule is that the PEP course must continue for at least $28$ days after the most recent qualifying exposure. We can track the required end date of the PEP course as each new exposure occurs. Let $T_{\\text{end}}$ be the end date of the PEP course.\n\n1.  **After the first exposure ($T_1=0$):**\n    PEP is initiated at $T_{\\text{start}} = 0.75$. The course must extend for $28$ days beyond this exposure.\n    The initial required end date is $T_{\\text{end},1} = T_1 + 28 = 0 + 28 = 28$ days.\n    The PEP course is scheduled to run over the interval $[0.75, 28]$.\n\n2.  **After the second exposure ($T_2=3.2$):**\n    This exposure occurs at day $3.2$. At this time, the patient is actively taking PEP, since $T_{\\text{start}} = 0.75 < T_2 = 3.2 < T_{\\text{end},1} = 28$.\n    Because the patient is already on PEP, no restart is necessary. Instead, the course duration is extended. The new required end date is $28$ days after this most recent exposure.\n    The new end date is $T_{\\text{end},2} = T_2 + 28 = 3.2 + 28 = 31.2$ days.\n    The PEP course is now scheduled to run over the interval $[0.75, 31.2]$.\n\n3.  **After the third exposure ($T_3=16.5$):**\n    This exposure occurs at day $16.5$. The patient is still on PEP, as $0.75 < 16.5 < 31.2$.\n    The course end date is again extended to be $28$ days after this exposure.\n    The new end date is $T_{\\text{end},3} = T_3 + 28 = 16.5 + 28 = 44.5$ days.\n    The PEP course is now scheduled to run over the interval $[0.75, 44.5]$.\n\n4.  **After the fourth exposure ($T_4=27.4$):**\n    This exposure occurs at day $27.4$. The patient is still on PEP, as $0.75 < 27.4 < 44.5$.\n    The final end date must be $28$ days after this last exposure.\n    The final end date is $T_{\\text{end}} = T_4 + 28 = 27.4 + 28 = 55.4$ days.\n    The complete PEP treatment interval is therefore $[T_{\\text{start}}, T_{\\text{end}}] = [0.75, 55.4]$.\n\nRegarding the requirement to explain whether restarts are needed, the analysis above provides the answer. A \"restart\" implies stopping and then starting a new course of PEP, which would typically be relevant if an exposure occurred after a previous PEP course was completed. In this case, each subsequent exposure ($T_2, T_3, T_4$) occurred while the patient was already on a continuous, ongoing course of PEP. Therefore, no restarts were required. The management consists solely of extending the end date of the single, continuous PEP course to ensure it lasts $28$ days past the final exposure.\n\nNext, we calculate the cumulative PEP coverage. The formula is given as:\n$$\n\\text{coverage} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{total time receiving PEP within the interval }[0,\\; T_{\\text{last}}+28]}{\\text{length of the interval }[0,\\; T_{\\text{last}}+28]}\n$$\nThe time of the last exposure is $T_{\\text{last}} = T_4 = 27.4$ days.\n\nThe evaluation interval is $[0, T_{\\text{last}}+28]$.\nThe end of this interval is $T_{\\text{last}} + 28 = 27.4 + 28 = 55.4$ days.\nSo, the evaluation interval is $[0, 55.4]$.\nThe length of this interval is $55.4 - 0 = 55.4$ days.\n\nThe total time the patient received PEP is the duration of the treatment interval, which we determined to be $[0.75, 55.4]$.\nThe duration of PEP is $T_{\\text{end}} - T_{\\text{start}} = 55.4 - 0.75 = 54.65$ days.\n\nThe PEP treatment interval $[0.75, 55.4]$ is fully contained within the evaluation interval $[0, 55.4]$. Therefore, the total time receiving PEP within the evaluation interval is simply the duration of the PEP course itself.\n\nNow, we can compute the coverage ratio:\n$$\n\\text{coverage} = \\frac{\\text{Duration of PEP}}{\\text{Length of evaluation interval}} = \\frac{54.65}{55.4}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\text{coverage} \\approx 0.9864620938...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $8$, $6$, and $4$. The fifth significant digit is $6$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\text{coverage} \\approx 0.9865\n$$\nThus, the cumulative PEP coverage is $0.9865$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9865}\n$$", "id": "4483213"}]}
