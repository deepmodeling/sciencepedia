By definition, the Number Needed to Screen is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction in the outcome of interest per person screened. Here, the outcome of interest is PID attributable to untreated Chlamydia trachomatis infection over a one-year horizon.\n\nWe proceed from fundamental epidemiologic definitions and the care cascade:\n\n1. Let $p$ denote the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis in the screened population. The probability that a randomly selected screened individual is infected is $p$.\n2. Let $\\text{Se}$ denote the sensitivity of the screening test. Conditional on being infected, the probability of testing positive is $\\text{Se}$.\n3. Let $E_{t}$ denote the efficacy of treatment in achieving microbiological cure. Conditional on testing positive and being treated, the probability of cure is $E_{t}$.\n4. Let $r$ denote the one-year risk of PID among untreated chlamydia-infected individuals.\n\nWe assume that successful microbiological cure reduces the chlamydia-attributable PID risk to approximately zero over the time horizon considered. Therefore, for an infected individual who is correctly identified by the test and successfully treated, the reduction in PID risk is $r$ (from $r$ to approximately $0$). Individuals who are not infected do not contribute to PID cases attributable to chlamydia, and false positives do not prevent PID cases because there is no chlamydia-attributable PID risk to reduce. False negatives and treatment failures do not contribute to prevention.\n\nThus, the expected absolute reduction in PID risk per person screened, denoted $\\Delta$, is the product of the probabilities of each step in the cascade multiplied by the risk reduction for those successfully cured:\n\n$$\n\\Delta = p \\cdot \\text{Se} \\cdot E_{t} \\cdot r.\n$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Screen (NNS) is the reciprocal of this expected reduction:\n\n$$\n\\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} = \\frac{1}{p \\cdot \\text{Se} \\cdot E_{t} \\cdot r}.\n$$\n\n\nWe substitute the given quantities, expressed as decimals:\n\n$$\np = 0.05,\\quad \\text{Se} = 0.90,\\quad E_{t} = 0.95,\\quad r = 0.10.\n$$\n\nCompute the product:\n\n$$\n\\Delta = 0.05 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.10.\n$$\n\nIt is convenient to convert each decimal to a rational form to retain exactness:\n\n$$\n0.05 = \\frac{1}{20},\\quad 0.90 = \\frac{9}{10},\\quad 0.95 = \\frac{19}{20},\\quad 0.10 = \\frac{1}{10}.\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right)\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{19}{20}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\frac{1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 1}{20 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{171}{40000}.\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} = \\frac{40000}{171}.\n$$\n\nTo obtain a numerical value, we evaluate\n\n$$\n\\frac{40000}{171} \\approx 233.9181287\\ldots\n$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, as requested, yields\n\n$$\n\\text{NNS} \\approx 234.\n$$\n\nThis means that, under the specified assumptions and parameters, approximately $234$ individuals must be screened to prevent one case of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease attributable to Chlamydia trachomatis over one year.\n\nWe note that this derivation assumes immediate treatment of all true positives, complete adherence, and no contribution of partner notification or reinfection dynamics within the time horizon.

The solution will be derived from first principles, specifically using the law of total expectation and the properties of independent Bernoulli trials.\n\nFirst, let us define the random variables and parameters involved for a single index case.\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the number of sexual partners elicited. The problem provides the expected value of $N$, denoted as $E[N]$.\nFor each of the $N$ partners, we have a sequence of events. Let $p_c$ be the probability of successfully contacting a partner. Let $p_t$ be the probability that a contacted partner initiates treatment.\nThe problem states that contact and treatment are independent Bernoulli processes at the partner level.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of partners who are treated per index case. We are asked to find the expected value of $X$, denoted $E[X]$.\n\nThe value of $X$ depends on the number of partners elicited, $N$. We can use the law of total expectation to find $E[X]$:\n$$\nE[X] = E[E[X|N]]\n$$\nFirst, we compute the conditional expectation of $X$ given that the number of elicited partners is $N=n$.\nFor a single elicited partner, say partner $j$, the event of this partner being treated is the conjunction of two independent events: the partner is successfully contacted (with probability $p_c$) and the partner, once contacted, accepts treatment (with probability $p_t$). The probability that a single elicited partner is ultimately treated is the product of these probabilities, due to their independence.\nLet $P(\\text{Treated}_j)$ be the probability that partner $j$ is treated.\n$$\nP(\\text{Treated}_j) = p_c \\times p_t\n$$\nLet us define a Bernoulli random variable $Y_j$ for each elicited partner $j=1, 2, ..., n$, where $Y_j=1$ if the partner is treated and $Y_j=0$ otherwise. The expectation of this Bernoulli variable is:\n$$\nE[Y_j] = 1 \\times P(Y_j=1) + 0 \\times P(Y_j=0) = P(Y_j=1) = p_c \\times p_t\n$$\nGiven $N=n$ elicited partners, the total number of treated partners is the sum of these individual Bernoulli variables:\n$$\nX | (N=n) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_j\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the conditional expectation of $X$ given $N=n$ is:\n$$\nE[X|N=n] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_j\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} E[Y_j] = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (p_c \\times p_t) = n \\times p_c \\times p_t\n$$\nThis relationship holds for any value $n$ that $N$ can take. Thus, we can express the conditional expectation as a function of the random variable $N$:\n$$\nE[X|N] = N \\times p_c \\times p_t\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the law of total expectation:\n$$\nE[X] = E[E[X|N]] = E[N \\times p_c \\times p_t]\n$$\nSince $p_c$ and $p_t$ are constants, we can factor them out of the expectation:\n$$\nE[X] = p_c \\times p_t \\times E[N]\n$$\nThis formula provides the expected number of treated partners per index case as a function of the expected number of elicited partners and the probabilities of contact and treatment.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the two modalities described in the problem.\n\nFor the current modality:\nThe expected number of elicited partners is $E[N_{\\text{curr}}] = 1.5$.\nThe probability of successful contact is $p_c = 0.70$.\nThe probability of treatment uptake is $p_t = 0.80$.\nThe expected number of treated partners under the current modality, $E[X_{\\text{curr}}]$, is:\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{curr}}] = p_c \\times p_t \\times E[N_{\\text{curr}}] = 0.70 \\times 0.80 \\times 1.5\n$$\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{curr}}] = 0.56 \\times 1.5 = 0.84\n$$\n\nFor the alternative modality:\nThe expected number of elicited partners is $E[N_{\\text{alt}}] = 2.0$.\nThe other parameters are unchanged: $p_c = 0.70$ and $p_t = 0.80$.\nThe expected number of treated partners under the alternative modality, $E[X_{\\text{alt}}]$, is:\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{alt}}] = p_c \\times p_t \\times E[N_{\\text{alt}}] = 0.70 \\times 0.80 \\times 2.0\n$$\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{alt}}] = 0.56 \\times 2.0 = 1.12\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute increase in the expected number of partners treated per index case.
