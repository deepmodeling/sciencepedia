A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the number of de novo resistant mutants that arise during therapy. Based on the problem statement, there are $N$ independent opportunities (trials) for a mutation to occur, and the probability of a mutation in any single opportunity (success) is $\\mu$. This scenario is precisely described by a binomial distribution. Therefore, the number of resistant mutants $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ and $\\mu$, which we denote as $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, \\mu)$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the binomial distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ successful events in $N$ trials:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{N}{k} \\mu^k (1-\\mu)^{N-k}$$\nfor $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that at least one resistant mutant arises. This is the probability $P(K \\ge 1)$. It is often more direct to calculate this using the complementary event, which is the probability that no resistant mutants arise, $P(K=0)$.\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - P(K=0)$$\n\nUsing the binomial PMF, the probability of zero mutants is:\n$$P(K=0) = \\binom{N}{0} \\mu^0 (1-\\mu)^{N-0} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1-\\mu)^N = (1-\\mu)^N$$\nThus, the exact probability under the binomial model is:\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - (1-\\mu)^N$$\n\nThe problem requires us to use the Poisson limit (law of rare events), which is appropriate under the stated conditions: $N$ is large, $\\mu$ is small, and their product $\\lambda = N\\mu$ is a finite constant of order $1$. The binomial distribution $\\text{Binomial}(N, \\mu)$ converges to the Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = N\\mu$ under these conditions.\n\nThe PMF of a Poisson-distributed random variable $K$ with mean $\\lambda$ is:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nTo show how the binomial probability $P(K=0)$ approaches the Poisson probability, we can analyze the limit of the binomial expression. Let $\\lambda=N\\mu$. Then $\\mu=\\lambda/N$.\n$$P(K=0) = (1-\\mu)^N = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^N$$\nFrom the fundamental definition of the exponential function, $\\exp(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1 + x/n)^n$, we see that as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^N = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nTherefore, for large $N$ and small $\\mu$, we have the approximation $P(K=0) \\approx \\exp(-\\lambda) = \\exp(-N\\mu)$.\n\nThe probability of at least one resistant mutant arising is then approximated as:\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - P(K=0) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-N\\mu)$$\nThis is the derived expression for the probability that at least one resistant mutant arises, in terms of $N$ and $\\mu$, under the Poisson approximation.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this probability for the given parameters: $N=10^{8}$ and $\\mu=10^{-8}$.\nFirst, we calculate the expected number of mutants, $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = N\\mu = (10^{8}) \\times (10^{-8}) = 1$$\nSubstituting this value into our derived expression:\n$$P(K \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-1)$$\nUsing the value of the mathematical constant $e \\approx 2.71828...$, we find $\\exp(-1)$:\n$$\\exp(-1) \\approx \\frac{1}{2.71828...} \\approx 0.36787944...$$\nThe probability is then:\n$$P(K \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - 0.36787944... = 0.63212055...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.

A solution will be generated.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\nWe begin by defining the events symbolically based on the foundational definitions provided.\nLet $S$ be the event that an isolate is truly phenotypically susceptible to ciprofloxacin.\nLet $S^c$ be the event that an isolate is truly non-susceptible (i.e., resistant). This is the complement of $S$.\nLet $T_S$ be the event that the molecular assay returns a \"susceptible\" call.\nLet $T_{NS}$ be the event that the assay returns a \"non-susceptible\" call.\n\nFrom the problem statement givens, we can formalize the probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of susceptible isolates is the prior probability of event $S$:\n    $$P(S) = 0.60$$\n    The prevalence of non-susceptible isolates is therefore:\n    $$P(S^c) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity is the probability that the assay calls an isolate \"susceptible\" given that it is truly susceptible. This is the conditional probability of $T_S$ given $S$:\n    $$\\text{Sensitivity} = P(T_S | S) = 0.98$$\n\n3.  The specificity is the probability that the assay calls an isolate \"non-susceptible\" given that it is truly non-susceptible. This is the conditional probability of $T_{NS}$ given $S^c$:\n    $$\\text{Specificity} = P(T_{NS} | S^c) = 0.95$$\n\nOur goal is to derive and calculate the posterior probability that an isolate is truly susceptible given that it received a \"susceptible\" assay call. This is the conditional probability $P(S | T_S)$, also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n\nWe start from Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events:\n$$P(S | T_S) = \\frac{P(T_S | S) P(S)}{P(T_S)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T_S)$, is the total probability of a \"susceptible\" test result. It can be expanded using the law of total probability over the sample space partitioned by $S$ and $S^c$:\n$$P(T_S) = P(T_S | S) P(S) + P(T_S | S^c) P(S^c)$$\n\nThe term $P(T_S | S^c)$ is the probability of a \"susceptible\" call given the isolate is non-susceptible. This is the false positive rate. Since the assay result is binary (either $T_S$ or $T_{NS}$), for any given true state, the probabilities of the outcomes must sum to $1$. Thus, for the non-susceptible state $S^c$:\n$$P(T_S | S^c) + P(T_{NS} | S^c) = 1$$\nWe can find $P(T_S | S^c)$ by rearranging this equation and using the definition of specificity:\n$$P(T_S | S^c) = 1 - P(T_{NS} | S^c) = 1 - \\text{Specificity}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$P(T_S | S^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expanded form of $P(T_S)$ back into Bayes' theorem to get the complete expression for the desired posterior probability:\n$$P(S | T_S) = \\frac{P(T_S | S) P(S)}{P(T_S | S) P(S) + P(T_S | S^c) P(S^c)}$$\nThis is the derived expression in terms of sensitivity, specificity (via $1-P(T_{NS}|S^c)$), and prevalence. Let's write it explicitly using these clinical terms:\n$$P(S | T_S) = \\frac{(\\text{Sensitivity}) (\\text{Prevalence})}{(\\text{Sensitivity}) (\\text{Prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{Specificity}) (1 - \\text{Prevalence})}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression to compute the final answer.\n-   $P(S) = \\text{Prevalence} = 0.60$\n-   $P(S^c) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$\n-   $P(T_S | S) = \\text{Sensitivity} = 0.98$\n-   $P(T_S | S^c) = 1 - \\text{Specificity} = 0.05$\n\n$$P(S | T_S) = \\frac{(0.98)(0.60)}{(0.98)(0.60) + (0.05)(0.40)}$$\nFirst, calculate the terms in the numerator and denominator:\n-   Numerator: $0.98 \\times 0.60 = 0.588$\n-   Denominator term 1: $0.98 \\times 0.60 = 0.588$\n-   Denominator term 2: $0.05 \\times 0.40 = 0.020$\nSumming the terms in the denominator:\n$$P(T_S) = 0.588 + 0.020 = 0.608$$\nFinally, we compute the fraction:\n$$P(S | T_S) = \\frac{0.588}{0.608}$$\n$$P(S | T_S) \\approx 0.967105263...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $0.9671$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9671}\n$$", "id": "4412869"}, {"introduction": "In an era of rising resistance, clinicians and public health officials must constantly evaluate and compare treatment strategies.

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $p_{A}$ be the probability of treatment failure (the event of interest) for a patient treated with azithromycin, and $p_{D}$ be the probability of failure for a patient treated with doxycycline. We are given the values $p_{A} = 0.12$ and $p_{D} = 0.05$.\n\nThe problem states that treatment failure for an individual is a Bernoulli outcome. Let us define a random variable for the outcome of a single patient. Let $X$ represent the outcome for a patient on azithromycin and $Y$ for a patient on doxycycline. We can assign the value $1$ to failure and $0$ to success (cure).\n-   For a patient on azithromycin, the random variable is $X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_{A})$.\n-   For a patient on doxycycline, the random variable is $Y \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_{D})$.\n\nAccording to the first foundational element (risk as a long-run event probability), the expected outcome of a single Bernoulli trial is its probability parameter. Therefore, the expected number of failures for one patient on azithromycin is $E[X] = p_{A}$, and for one patient on doxycycline is $E[Y] = p_{D}$.\n\nNow, consider a cohort of $n$ patients. Let $\\{X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\}$ be the outcomes if all $n$ patients are treated with azithromycin. The total number of failures in this group is the sum $S_{A} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. According to the second foundational element (linearity of expectation), the expected total number of failures is the sum of the individual expectations:\n$$E[S_{A}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{A} = n p_{A}$$\n\nSimilarly, if the same cohort of $n$ patients were treated with doxycycline, the outcomes would be $\\{Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_n\\}$, and the total number of failures would be $S_{D} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$. The expected total number of failures in the doxycycline group is:\n$$E[S_{D}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[Y_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{D} = n p_{D}$$\n\nThe number of events (failures) averted by switching the treatment of all $n$ patients from azithromycin to doxycycline is the difference in the number of failures, $S_{A} - S_{D}$. The expected number of events averted is found by again applying the linearity of expectation:\n$$E\\left[\\text{events averted}\\right] = E[S_{A} - S_{D}] = E[S_{A}] - E[S_{D}] = n p_{A} - n p_{D} = n(p_{A} - p_{D})$$\nThe term $p_{A} - p_{D}$ is the absolute risk reduction (ARR).\n\nAccording to the third foundational element, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the number $n$ of patients for which the expected number of events averted is exactly one. We set up the equation:\n$$n(p_{A} - p_{D}) = 1$$\n\nSolving for $n$ gives the desired expression for the NNT:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{p_{A} - p_{D}}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values, $p_{A} = 0.12$ and $p_{D} = 0.05$, into this expression:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.12 - 0.05} = \\frac{1}{0.07}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a single simplified fraction. We convert the decimal in the denominator to a fraction: $0.07 = \\frac{7}{100}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{100}} = \\frac{100}{7}$$\nThis is the final exact value as a simplified fraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{100}{7}}$$", "id": "4412867"}]}
