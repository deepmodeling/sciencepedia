You are asked to quantify the posterior probability that the patient has acute HIV infection given the presence of rash. Let the rash be modeled as a binary clinical sign, and let $D$ denote the event that the patient has acute HIV infection and $R$ denote the event that the rash is present. Assume the following foundational definitions hold: sensitivity $Se$ is defined as $P(R \\mid D)$; specificity $Sp$ is defined as $P(\\neg R \\mid \\neg D)$; and the pretest probability of disease $P$ is defined as $P(D)$, with $P(\\neg D)=1-P$.

It is not directly provided. We must express it in terms of the given quantities using the law of total probability. The event space can be partitioned by the presence or absence of the disease, $D$ and $\\neg D$. Therefore, the probability of event $R$ can be written as:\n$$P(R) = P(R \\mid D)P(D) + P(R \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D)$$\n\nWe can substitute the known quantities into this expression:\n-   $P(R \\mid D) = Se$\n-   $P(D) = P$\n-   $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P$\n\nThe term $P(R \\mid \\neg D)$ is the probability of a rash given the absence of the disease (a false positive). This is not directly given, but it can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. The specificity is defined as $Sp = P(\\neg R \\mid \\neg D)$, which is the probability of not having a rash given the absence of the disease. Since a person in the disease-negative group either has a rash or does not, the probabilities must sum to $1$:\n$$P(R \\mid \\neg D) + P(\\neg R \\mid \\neg D) = 1$$\nSolving for $P(R \\mid \\neg D)$, we get:\n$$P(R \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg R \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nNow, we can substitute all the components back into the expression for the denominator, $P(R)$:\n$$P(R) = (Se)(P) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the original Bayes' theorem equation to obtain the desired posterior probability, $P(D \\mid R)$:\n$$P(D \\mid R) = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{Se \\cdot P + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)}$$\n\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the posterior probability of acute HIV infection given the presence of a rash, expressed solely in terms of the sensitivity ($Se$), specificity ($Sp$), and pretest probability ($P$).

[@problem_id:4427416]", "problem": "A Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) clinic implements universal pre-prescription Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-B*57:01 genotyping to reduce abacavir-associated Abacavir Hypersensitivity Reaction (HSR), which often presents with fever, malaise, and a morbilliform rash as a cutaneous manifestation. Consider an abacavir-eligible cohort in which the true prevalence of the HLA-B*57:01 allele is $p = 0.07$. Without any screening, clinicians prescribe abacavir to all eligible patients, and the probability of developing HSR upon abacavir exposure is $r_{c} = 0.55$ for true HLA-B*57:01 carriers and $r_{n} = 0.02$ for true non-carriers. With universal screening, a single-locus genetic test is used that has sensitivity $s = 0.99$ and specificity $sp = 0.995$. The clinic policy is to avoid abacavir in any test-positive patient and to prescribe abacavir to any test-negative patient. Assume that abacavir HSR can occur only in those who receive abacavir and that test results do not change the underlying probabilities $r_{c}$ and $r_{n}$ conditional on true carrier status.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of incidence, sensitivity, and specificity, along with the law of total probability, compute the expected fractional reduction in abacavir HSR incidence in this cohort after implementing screening compared to the incidence without screening. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction (not as a percentage) and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected fractional reduction in the incidence of abacavir-associated Hypersensitivity Reaction (HSR) following the implementation of a universal $HLA-B^*57:01$ screening program. To compute this, we must first calculate the incidence of HSR without screening ($I_0$) and with screening ($I_s$). The fractional reduction, $R$, is then given by the formula $R = \\frac{I_0 - I_s}{I_0} = 1 - \\frac{I_s}{I_0}$.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and probabilities based on the problem statement.\nLet $C$ denote the event that a patient is a true carrier of the $HLA-B^*57:01$ allele, and $N$ be the event that the patient is a non-carrier.\nLet $HSR$ be the event that a patient develops HSR.\nLet $T+$ and $T-$ denote the events of a positive and a negative test result, respectively.\n\nThe givens from the problem are:\nThe prevalence of the allele: $P(C) = p = 0.07$.\nThe probability of a patient being a non-carrier: $P(N) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.07 = 0.93$.\nThe probability of HSR in an exposed carrier: $P(HSR | C, \\text{exposed}) = r_c = 0.55$.\nThe probability of HSR in an exposed non-carrier: $P(HSR | N, \\text{exposed}) = r_n = 0.02$.\nThe sensitivity of the test: $P(T+ | C) = s = 0.99$.\nThe specificity of the test: $P(T- | N) = sp = 0.995$.\n\nFrom the definitions of sensitivity and specificity, we can derive the probabilities of incorrect test results:\nThe false negative rate: $P(T- | C) = 1 - s = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$.\nThe false positive rate: $P(T+ | N) = 1 - sp = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$.\n\nNext, we calculate the HSR incidence without screening, $I_0$. In this scenario, all eligible patients are prescribed abacavir. The total incidence is the weighted sum of incidences in carriers and non-carriers, governed by the law of total probability:\n$$I_0 = P(HSR) = P(HSR | C)P(C) + P(HSR | N)P(N)$$\nSince all patients are exposed, $P(HSR | C) = r_c$ and $P(HSR | N) = r_n$.\n$$I_0 = r_c p + r_n (1 - p)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$I_0 = (0.55)(0.07) + (0.02)(0.93) = 0.0385 + 0.0186 = 0.0571$$\n\nNow, we calculate the HSR incidence with screening, $I_s$. With the screening policy, only patients who test negative ($T-$) are prescribed abacavir. Therefore, HSR can only occur in patients who test negative. The incidence $I_s$ is the total probability of a patient testing negative and developing HSR, $P(HSR \\cap T-)$. We again apply the law of total probability, conditioning on the true carrier status:\n$$I_s = P(HSR \\cap T- | C)P(C) + P(HSR \\cap T- | N)P(N)$$\nLet's analyze each term. The event $(HSR \\cap T- | C)$ means a true carrier tests negative and develops HSR. For this to happen, the carrier must receive a false-negative result (with probability $1-s$) and subsequently develop HSR upon exposure (with probability $r_c$). The problem states that test results do not change the underlying HSR probabilities, implying conditional independence of the HSR event and test result given the true status and exposure.\nThus, $P(HSR \\cap T- | C) = P(HSR | C, T-, \\text{exposed}) P(T- | C) = r_c (1-s)$.\nSimilarly, the event $(HSR \\cap T- | N)$ means a true non-carrier tests negative and develops HSR. This requires a true-negative result (with probability $sp$) and subsequent HSR upon exposure (with probability $r_n$).\nThus, $P(HSR \\cap T- | N) = P(HSR | N, T-, \\text{exposed}) P(T- | N) = r_n sp$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $I_s$:\n$$I_s = r_c (1-s) p + r_n sp (1-p)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$I_s = (0.55)(0.01)(0.07) + (0.02)(0.995)(0.93)$$\n$$I_s = 0.000385 + (0.0199)(0.93)$$\n$$I_s = 0.000385 + 0.018507 = 0.018892$$\n\nFinally, we compute the fractional reduction in HSR incidence, $R$:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{I_s}{I_0} = 1 - \\frac{0.018892}{0.0571}$$\n$$R \\approx 1 - 0.33085814...$$\n$$R \\approx 0.66914185...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.6691$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6691}$$", "id": "4427416"}]}
