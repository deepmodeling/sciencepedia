Classic clinical and diagnostic features of tinea manuum.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The case is a classic, albeit uncommon, presentation of a recognized medical condition (acrokeratosis paraneoplastica). The clinical findings, patient history, diagnostic tests, and histopathology report use standard, accurate medical terminology. The association between the described dermatosis and internal malignancy is well-established in dermatologic and oncologic literature. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary information to differentiate between the primary diagnostic considerations (acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, psoriasis vulgaris, tinea manuum) is provided. The clinical, laboratory, and pathological data are internally consistent and point toward a specific conclusion. The question is structured to test diagnostic reasoning and understanding of clinical implications.\n-   **Objective:** The description is factual and observational, free from subjective or biased language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-constructed clinical vignette that is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will proceed with a full derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe task is to integrate the clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings to establish the most likely diagnosis and explain the clinical importance of this diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Differential Diagnosis:** The provided foundational bases suggest a differential diagnosis including psoriasis vulgaris and tinea manuum. The case presentation itself, however, strongly points to a third entity: a paraneoplastic syndrome.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Tinea Manuum:** The foundational base describes tinea manuum as typically unilateral (part of a \"two feet–one hand\" pattern) with a positive KOH test for hyphae. The patient presents with **symmetric** involvement of the hands and feet. The KOH preparation was **negative**, and fungal stains on the biopsy were also **negative**. Furthermore, the condition was refractory to a $4$-week course of oral terbinafine, a systemic antifungal agent. These findings collectively and conclusively rule out tinea as the primary diagnosis.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Psoriasis Vulgaris:** The foundational base describes classic psoriasis with plaques on extensor surfaces (elbows, knees), which are explicitly absent in this patient. The histopathology is described as \"psoriasiform,\" which means it resembles psoriasis in its epidermal thickening. However, a key feature of classic psoriasis, neutrophilic aggregates forming Munro microabscesses, is explicitly noted as absent. The distribution of lesions to the nasal tip and ear helices, while not impossible in psoriasis, is much more characteristic of another diagnosis. The patient's profound nail dystrophy and resistance to high-potency corticosteroids are also red flags raising suspicion beyond uncomplicated psoriasis. While there is overlap, the evidence argues against a diagnosis of typical psoriasis vulgaris.\n\n4.  **Evaluating Acrokeratosis Paraneoplastica (Bazex Syndrome):** This diagnosis must be considered in light of the constellation of findings that do not fit the more common diagnoses, especially in the context of systemic symptoms.\n    -   **Clinical Fit:** This syndrome is classically defined by symmetric, violaceous, psoriasiform plaques on acral sites, characteristically including the nose and ear helices—a perfect match for the patient's presentation. Early and severe nail dystrophy is another hallmark feature.\n    -   **Paraneoplastic Context:** The patient is a $68$-year-old male with a significant smoking history who presents with alarm symptoms: unintended weight loss and new dysphagia. This clinical context is highly suspicious for an underlying malignancy. Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica is an established paraneoplastic syndrome, most frequently associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (larynx, pharynx, esophagus, upper lung). The patient's dysphagia points directly to this location.\n    -   **Histopathologic Fit:** The biopsy findings of a non-specific psoriasiform dermatitis with a lymphocytic infiltrate and lack of neutrophils are fully compatible with described findings for acrokeratosis paraneoplastica.\n    -   **Therapeutic Response:** The dermatosis of Bazex syndrome is notoriously refractory to standard dermatologic treatments but improves or resolves with successful treatment of the underlying cancer. The patient's failure to respond to potent topical steroids and antifungals fits this pattern.\n\n5.  **Synthesis and Implication:** The integration of the specific dermatosis pattern (symmetric acral, ear, nose), severe nail changes, refractoriness to therapy, systemic alarm symptoms (weight loss, dysphagia), patient risk factors (smoking history), and non-specific but exclusionary laboratory and pathology findings makes acrokeratosis paraneoplastica of Bazex the leading diagnosis. Misclassifying this condition as a more benign, common dermatosis like psoriasis or tinea would lead to a focus on symptomatic skin treatment. This would tragically delay the necessary urgent investigation (e.g., upper endoscopy) for the underlying, life-threatening malignancy, allowing it to progress untreated.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Symmetric acral violaceous plaques with ear and nasal tip involvement, early prominent nail dystrophy, negative KOH, psoriasiform dermatitis without neutrophilic microabscesses, and refractoriness to standard topical and antifungal therapy favor a paraneoplastic acral psoriasiform dermatosis (Bazex) associated with upper aerodigestive tract carcinoma; misclassification as psoriasis or tinea leads to prolonged symptomatic treatment without prompt malignancy workup, delaying identification and definitive treatment of the neoplasm.**\n-   This option accurately synthesizes all the positive and negative clinicopathologic findings presented in the case. It correctly identifies the classic features of Bazex syndrome, links them to the highly probable underlying malignancy type, and correctly articulates the severe consequence of misdiagnosis—a delay in cancer treatment.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Unilateral hand involvement in a “two feet–one hand” pattern, positive KOH for hyphae, and histopathological identification of dermatophyte elements favor tinea manuum; misclassification would delay cancer diagnosis because antifungal therapy induces fungal resistance that masks concurrent neoplasia.**\n-   This option describes findings directly contradicted by the case (symmetric vs. unilateral, negative vs. positive KOH). The explanation for delayed cancer diagnosis is medically nonsensical; antifungal resistance does not 'mask' neoplasia.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Classic extensor plaques with silvery scale and nail pitting, negative KOH, and histology showing neutrophilic microabscesses and regular acanthosis favor psoriasis vulgaris; misclassification delays cancer diagnosis because psoriasis is itself a paraneoplastic dermatosis that should trigger oncologic screening.**\n-   This option describes features of classic psoriasis vulgaris that are absent in the patient (extensor plaques, neutrophilic microabscesses). While psoriasis can rarely be paraneoplastic, it is not considered an obligate paraneoplastic sign in the same category as Bazex syndrome. The statement that psoriasis *is* a paraneoplastic dermatosis that *should* trigger screening is an oversimplification and misrepresents standard clinical practice and the relative risk compared to the patient's actual condition.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Painful erythematous nodules with fever, histology showing dense neutrophilic dermal infiltrate, and negative KOH favor Sweet syndrome; misclassification delays cancer diagnosis because all neutrophilic dermatoses are obligate paraneoplastic conditions necessitating immediate oncologic evaluation.**\n-   This option describes the clinical and histologic features of Sweet syndrome, which are entirely different from the patient's presentation (nodules vs. plaques; neutrophilic vs. lymphocytic infiltrate). The claim that *all* neutrophilic dermatoses are *obligate* paraneoplastic conditions is a false absolute statement.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4430955"}, {"introduction": "Once a paraneoplastic syndrome is suspected, clinicians turn to biomarkers to refine the diagnosis and quantify the risk of an underlying malignancy.

A unique solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using quantitative, objective language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary objective is to calculate the five-year cumulative incidence of cancer, denoted as $CI_{5}$. Cumulative incidence is defined as the proportion of individuals in a population, initially free of the outcome, who develop the outcome over a specified period.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a subject is diagnosed with cancer within the first year of follow-up (i.e., in the time interval $[0, 1]$ years).\nLet $B$ be the event that a subject is diagnosed with cancer during the subsequent four years of follow-up (i.e., in the time interval $(1, 5]$ years).\n\nThe five-year cumulative incidence, $CI_{5}$, is the probability that a subject is diagnosed with cancer at any point within the five-year period. This corresponds to the probability of the union of events $A$ and $B$, $P(A \\cup B)$.\n\nThe event space can be partitioned into two disjoint events that lead to a cancer diagnosis within five years:\n1. The subject is diagnosed in the first year (event $A$).\n2. The subject is not diagnosed in the first year (event $A^c$) AND is diagnosed in years $2$ through $5$ (event $B$).\n\nTherefore, the total probability $P(A \\cup B)$ can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of these two disjoint events:\n$$CI_{5} = P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(A^c \\cap B)$$\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, the term $P(A^c \\cap B)$ can be rewritten as:\n$$P(A^c \\cap B) = P(B | A^c) \\times P(A^c)$$\nwhere $P(B | A^c)$ is the probability of being diagnosed in years $2$-$5$ given that the subject was cancer-free at year one, and $P(A^c)$ is the probability of being cancer-free at year one.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n1. The cumulative incidence of cancer in the first year is $30\\%$. This is $P(A)$.\n$$P(A) = 0.30$$\n2. Among those who remain cancer-free at one year, an additional $6\\%$ are diagnosed with cancer during years $2$ through $5$. This is the conditional probability $P(B | A^c)$.\n$$P(B | A^c) = 0.06$$\n\nFrom $P(A)$, we can calculate the probability of its complement, $P(A^c)$, which is the proportion of the cohort remaining cancer-free at one year:\n$$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the expression for $CI_{5}$:\n$$CI_{5} = P(A) + P(B | A^c) \\times P(A^c)$$\n$$CI_{5} = 0.30 + (0.06) \\times (0.70)$$\n$$CI_{5} = 0.30 + 0.042$$\n$$CI_{5} = 0.342$$\n\nThe five-year cumulative incidence of cancer in this cohort is $0.342$. The problem requires this to be rounded to three significant figures, which it already is.\n\n### Interpretation of Residual Risk\nThe second task is to interpret the magnitude of the residual risk after one year in the context of cancer screening. The risk of cancer diagnosis is sharply front-loaded. The incidence in the first year alone is $30\\%$. The \"residual risk\" for the $70\\%$ of the cohort that remains cancer-free after one year is $6\\%$ over the subsequent four years.\n\nThis disparity in risk ($30\\%$ in year $1$ vs. $6\\%$ over years $2$-$5$) has direct implications for clinical practice. It strongly suggests that the most critical period for cancer surveillance is immediately following the diagnosis of dermatomyositis and throughout the first year. An intensive screening protocol during this initial period is justified by the high yield. After one year, while the risk does not return to baseline (a $6\\%$ risk over four years is still significantly elevated), it is substantially lower. This supports a strategy where the intensity of screening could be de-escalated for patients who remain cancer-free after the first year. The findings justify a front-loaded screening strategy, concentrating resources where the risk is highest.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.342}$$", "id": "4430939"}]}
