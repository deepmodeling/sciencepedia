It requires the application of the standardized Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) to a realistic clinical scenario.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement: determination of the CTCAE grade and an outline of a risk-based monitoring and escalation plan.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of CTCAE Grade**\n\nThe CTCAE framework grades the severity of adverse events based on objective criteria. For maculopapular eruptions, the primary axes of classification are the percentage of total body surface area (BSA) involved and the impact on activities of daily living (ADL). The problem provides the following data for the patient:\n1.  Extent of involvement: The eruption covers $22\\%$ of the total BSA.\n2.  Impact on ADL: The accompanying pruritus is \"interfering with sleep and work.\"\n\nI will reference the definitions from the CTCAE, version $5.0$, for \"Rash maculo-papular\":\n-   **Grade 1:** Macules/papules covering $<10\\%$ BSA with or without symptoms; not interfering with ADL.\n-   **Grade 2:** Macules/papules covering $10\\%$ to $30\\%$ BSA with or without symptoms; limiting instrumental ADL.\n-   **Grade 3:** Macules/papules covering $>30\\%$ BSA with or without associated symptoms; limiting self-care ADL.\n-   **Grade 4:** Life-threatening consequences; signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN); urgent intervention indicated.\n-   **Grade 5:** Death.\n\nAnalysis based on the provided data:\n\n1.  **BSA Involvement:** The patient's rash covers $22\\%$ of the BSA. This value falls squarely within the range defined for a Grade $2$ event, which is $10\\%$ to $30\\%$ BSA. It is greater than the $<10\\%$ threshold for Grade $1$ and less than the $>30\\%$ threshold for Grade $3$.\n\n2.  **Impact on ADL:** The problem states the pruritus is \"interfering with sleep and work.\" The CTCAE distinguishes between *instrumental ADL* (e.g., managing finances, transportation, shopping, work) and *self-care ADL* (e.g., bathing, dressing, eating). Interference with work is a clear example of limiting instrumental ADL. While interference with sleep is a measure of symptom severity, the functional impairment related to work directly maps to the CTCAE definition for a Grade $2$ event (\"limiting instrumental ADL\"). This is distinct from a Grade $3$ event, which is characterized by the limitation of self-care ADL.\n\n**Conclusion on Grading:** Both axes of assessment consistently point to a single grade. The BSA of $22\\%$ aligns with Grade $2$, and the functional impact of limiting instrumental ADL also aligns with Grade $2$. Therefore, the appropriate CTCAE grade for this adverse event is $2$.\n\n**Part 2: Monitoring and Escalation Plan**\n\nGrounded in risk-based monitoring principles, the plan for a Grade $2$ cutaneous adverse event must ensure timely detection of progression while initiating appropriate management. The initial management for a Grade $2$ maculopapular rash typically involves high-potency topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines. The oncologic therapy (PD-1 inhibitor) is usually continued with close monitoring.\n\n**Immediate Monitoring Frequency:**\nFor a new-onset Grade $2$ event, the patient should be monitored closely to assess the trajectory of the rash and symptoms.\n-   **Frequency:** A clinical evaluation should occur at a minimum of once per week. This can be conducted via an in-person visit or telehealth, contingent on the ability to obtain high-quality clinical photographs to accurately assess the rash's extent and morphology.\n\n**Clear, Quantitative Escalation Triggers:**\nEscalation involves either intensification of dermatologic management (e.g., adding a course of systemic corticosteroids) or alteration of the oncologic therapy (i.e., holding the PD-1 inhibitor). The following triggers necessitate one or both of these actions:\n\n1.  **Progression in Extent:**\n    -   **Trigger:** The rash expands to cover more than $30\\%$ of the total BSA.\n    -   **Action:** This quantitatively re-classifies the event as a Grade $3$ adverse event. Management must be escalated to include systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone at $0.5\\text{–}1$ mg/kg/day or equivalent), and holding the PD-1 inhibitor should be strongly considered until the rash improves to Grade $1$ or baseline.\n\n2.  **Progression in Functional Impact:**\n    -   **Trigger:** The patient reports new or worsening symptoms that result in limitation of self-care ADL (e.g., inability to bathe or dress independently due to pain, pruritus, or skin fragility).\n    -   **Action:** This also re-classifies the event as Grade $3$ severity, independent of the BSA involved. The management escalation is the same as for progression in extent.\n\n3.  **Development of Alarm Signs/Symptoms (SCARs):**\n    -   **Trigger:** The appearance of any of the following features, which are suggestive of a potential severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) such as SJS, TEN, or Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS):\n        -   Mucosal involvement (e.g., painful erosions or ulcers on lips, oral cavity, conjunctiva, or genitalia).\n        -   Development of vesicles, bullae (blisters), or epidermal detachment (e.g., a positive Nikolsky sign).\n        -   Significant constitutional symptoms such as fever (e.g., temperature $>38.5^\\circ \\text{C}$), severe malaise, or lymphadenopathy.\n        -   Development of notable cutaneous or facial edema.\n        -   Cutaneous pain that is out of proportion to the visible rash.\n    -   **Action:** These are red flags for a potential Grade $4$ event. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate cessation of the PD-1 inhibitor and urgent hospital admission for dermatologic consultation and intensive supportive care.\n\n4.  **Failure to Respond to Initial Management:**\n    -   **Trigger:** Lack of improvement or continued worsening of the rash (extent, pruritus) after $1$ to $2$ weeks of appropriate Grade $2$ therapy (e.g., high-potency topical steroids).\n    -   **Action:** This indicates that the current management is insufficient. Escalation to systemic corticosteroids should be initiated, and a temporary hold of the PD-1 inhibitor may be considered, depending on the rate of progression and severity of symptoms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4425023"}, {"introduction": "Beyond general severity grading, certain rash morphologies require more specialized assessment tools to quantify their features precisely. Psoriasiform eruptions, a notable adverse event associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, are best assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). This practice will guide you through the meticulous calculation of a PASI score, integrating measures of erythema, induration, desquamation, and body surface area involvement across different regions. This quantitative skill is invaluable for establishing a baseline severity and objectively monitoring the response to treatment, which is critical when balancing dermatologic care with the need to maintain life-saving oncologic therapy.

On full-skin examination, involvement is regionally distributed as follows, with cutaneous morphology graded in each anatomic region using the $0$ to $4$ ordinal scale for erythema, induration (thickness), and desquamation (scaling), where higher values indicate greater severity.\n\n- Head and neck: regional involvement $9\\%$; erythema $2$, induration $1$, desquamation $2$.\n- Upper limbs: regional involvement $32\\%$; erythema $3$, induration $2$, desquamation $3$.\n- Trunk: regional involvement $15\\%$; erythema $2$, induration $2$, desquamation $2$.\n- Lower limbs: regional involvement $28\\%$; erythema $3$, induration $3$, desquamation $2$.\n\nUsing the definitions of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), compute the total PASI score for this presentation.

All necessary information is provided, and the task is consistent with the application of established principles in dermatology and oncology.\n\nThe problem requires two distinct outputs: first, the calculation of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, and second, an outline of a management strategy.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the PASI Score**\n\nThe PASI score is a composite index that accounts for the severity (erythema, induration, desquamation) and extent (area of involvement) of psoriasis across four body regions: head and neck (H), upper limbs (U), trunk (T), and lower limbs (L). The general formula for the PASI score is:\n$$\n\\text{PASI} = 0.1 \\times S_H \\times A_H + 0.2 \\times S_U \\times A_U + 0.3 \\times S_T \\times A_T + 0.4 \\times S_L \\times A_L\n$$\nwhere the coefficients ($0.1$, $0.2$, $0.3$, $0.4$) represent the relative body surface area of each region. For each region $R \\in \\{H, U, T, L\\}$, $S_R$ is the sum of the severity scores for erythema ($E_R$), induration ($I_R$), and desquamation ($D_R$), and $A_R$ is the area score.\n\nFirst, we determine the area score ($A_R$) for each region based on the given percentage of involvement and the provided conversion scale.\n\n**1. Head and Neck (H)**\n- Regional involvement: $9\\%$\n- According to the provided scale, involvement $<10\\%$ corresponds to an area score of $1$. Therefore, $A_H = 1$.\n- Severity scores: Erythema ($E_H$) = $2$, Induration ($I_H$) = $1$, Desquamation ($D_H$) = $2$.\n- The sum of severity scores for the head is $S_H = E_H + I_H + D_H = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5$.\n- The contribution to the PASI score from the head is $P_H = 0.1 \\times S_H \\times A_H = 0.1 \\times 5 \\times 1 = 0.5$.\n\n**2. Upper Limbs (U)**\n- Regional involvement: $32\\%$\n- Involvement between $30\\%$ and $49\\%$ corresponds to an area score of $3$. Therefore, $A_U = 3$.\n- Severity scores: Erythema ($E_U$) = $3$, Induration ($I_U$) = $2$, Desquamation ($D_U$) = $3$.\n- The sum of severity scores for the upper limbs is $S_U = E_U + I_U + D_U = 3 + 2 + 3 = 8$.\n- The contribution to the PASI score from the upper limbs is $P_U = 0.2 \\times S_U \\times A_U = 0.2 \\times 8 \\times 3 = 4.8$.\n\n**3. Trunk (T)**\n- Regional involvement: $15\\%$\n- Involvement between $10\\%$ and $29\\%$ corresponds to an area score of $2$. Therefore, $A_T = 2$.\n- Severity scores: Erythema ($E_T$) = $2$, Induration ($I_T$) = $2$, Desquamation ($D_T$) = $2$.\n- The sum of severity scores for the trunk is $S_T = E_T + I_T + D_T = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6$.\n- The contribution to the PASI score from the trunk is $P_T = 0.3 \\times S_T \\times A_T = 0.3 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 3.6$.\n\n**4. Lower Limbs (L)**\n- Regional involvement: $28\\%$\n- Involvement between $10\\%$ and $29\\%$ corresponds to an area score of $2$. Therefore, $A_L = 2$.\n- Severity scores: Erythema ($E_L$) = $3$, Induration ($I_L$) = $3$, Desquamation ($D_L$) = $2$.\n- The sum of severity scores for the lower limbs is $S_L = E_L + I_L + D_L = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8$.\n- The contribution to the PASI score from the lower limbs is $P_L = 0.4 \\times S_L \\times A_L = 0.4 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 6.4$.\n\n**Total PASI Score**\nThe total PASI score is the sum of the contributions from each region:\n$$\n\\text{PASI}_{\\text{total}} = P_H + P_U + P_T + P_L = 0.5 + 4.8 + 3.6 + 6.4 = 15.3\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $15.3$ is expressed as $15.30$.\n\n**Part 2: Outline of Dermatologic Management Strategy**\n\nThe clinical objective is to manage the cutaneous immune-related adverse event (irAE) while preserving the anti-tumor efficacy of nivolumab, which is a life-prolonging therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma. The strategy is based on the severity of the eruption and follows a stepwise approach, prioritizing therapies with minimal systemic immunosuppression.\n\nThe calculated PASI score of $15.3$ signifies a moderate-to-severe psoriasiform eruption. The patient has no systemic symptoms, which is a favorable prognostic factor.\n\n**Stepwise Management Plan:**\n\n1.  **Continue Nivolumab and Initiate First-Line Topical Therapy:** Given the moderate severity and lack of systemic or life-threatening features, continuation of nivolumab is paramount. Aggressive topical therapy should be initiated immediately. This includes:\n    - High-potency topical corticosteroids (e.g., clobetasol propionate $0.05\\%$ ointment) applied to affected plaques.\n    - Topical vitamin D analogues (e.g., calcipotriene) used adjunctively to increase efficacy and limit corticosteroid-associated side effects.\n    - Liberal use of emollients to restore skin barrier function and reduce scaling.\n    - Oral antihistamines for symptomatic relief of pruritus.\n\n2.  **Escalate to Phototherapy for Inadequate Response:** If the eruption does not respond adequately to topical treatment or is too widespread for practical application, the next step is narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy. This modality offers potent, localized immunomodulation within the skin without causing systemic immunosuppression, making it an ideal choice for this clinical scenario.\n\n3.  **Consider Systemic Agents with Minimal Immunosuppression:** For cases refractory to phototherapy or where it is contraindicated/unavailable, certain systemic agents can be considered. The choice is guided by the need to avoid broad immunosuppression that could antagonize nivolumab's mechanism of action.\n    - **Acitretin:** An oral retinoid that is effective for psoriasis and is not immunosuppressive.\n    - **Apremilast:** An oral phosphodiesterase-$4$ (PDE$4$) inhibitor with a favorable safety profile and minimal immunosuppressive effects.\n\n4.  **Consider Targeted Biologics in Refractory Cases:** If the eruption is severe and refractory to the above measures, significantly impacting the patient's quality of life, targeted biologic therapies can be used. This decision requires a multidisciplinary discussion between the dermatologist and oncologist.\n    - **IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors:** These agents (e.g., secukinumab, guselkumab) are highly effective for psoriasis. While there is a theoretical concern for interfering with the anti-tumor immune response, emerging evidence suggests they can be used with relative safety without compromising oncologic outcomes.\n\n5.  **Therapies to Avoid:** Broad-spectrum systemic immunosuppressants, such as systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), methotrexate, and cyclosporine, should be strictly avoided. Their use would directly counteract the T-cell activation central to nivolumab's anti-cancer efficacy and are reserved only for life-threatening irAEs.\n\nThe decision to hold or discontinue nivolumab is a last resort, made in conjunction with the oncology team, for eruptions that become life-threatening (e.g., progress to erythroderma) or are unmanageable and cause extreme patient morbidity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15.30}$$", "id": "4424943"}, {"introduction": "The ability to distinguish common, manageable rashes from rare, life-threatening Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) is arguably the most critical skill in this field.
