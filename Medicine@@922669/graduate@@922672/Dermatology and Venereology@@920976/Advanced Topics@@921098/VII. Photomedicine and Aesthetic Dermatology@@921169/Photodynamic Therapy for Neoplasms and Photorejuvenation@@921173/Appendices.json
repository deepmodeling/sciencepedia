The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution requires relating the radiometric quantities of energy fluence ($H$) and irradiance ($E$).\n\nBy definition, irradiance ($E$) is the radiant power ($P$) incident per unit area ($A$):\n$$\nE = \\frac{P}{A}\n$$\nThe units of irradiance are power per area (e.g., $\\text{W/m}^2$ or $\\text{mW/cm}^2$).\n\nEnergy fluence ($H$), sometimes called dose in this context, is the total radiant energy ($\\mathcal{E}$) delivered per unit area ($A$):\n$$\nH = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{A}\n$$\nThe units of energy fluence are energy per area (e.g., $\\text{J/m}^2$ or $\\text{J/cm}^2$).\n\nPower ($P$) is the rate at which energy ($\\mathcal{E}$) is delivered over time ($t$). For a source that is \"continuous and temporally stable,\" as stated in the problem, the power is constant. Thus, the total energy delivered over an exposure time interval $\\Delta t$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = P \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nWe can now establish a direct relationship between energy fluence and irradiance. Substituting the expression for energy $\\mathcal{E}$ into the definition of energy fluence $H$:\n$$\nH = \\frac{P \\times \\Delta t}{A}\n$$\nRecognizing that the term $\\frac{P}{A}$ is the definition of irradiance $E$, we can write:\n$$\nH = E \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nThis fundamental equation states that for a constant irradiance, the total energy fluence delivered is the product of the irradiance and the exposure time. The problem asks for the exposure time, $\\Delta t$, which can be found by rearranging the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{H}{E}\n$$\nWe are given the values:\n-   $H = 75\\ \\text{J/cm}^2$\n-   $E = 100\\ \\text{mW/cm}^2$\n\nBefore performing the calculation, we must ensure the units are consistent. The energy unit in $H$ is Joules ($\\text{J}$), while the power unit in $E$ is milliwatts ($\\text{mW}$). We must convert milliwatts to a unit compatible with Joules. By definition, $1\\ \\text{Watt} = 1\\ \\text{Joule per second}$ ($1\\ \\text{W} = 1\\ \\text{J/s}$). Therefore:\n$$\n1\\ \\text{mW} = 10^{-3}\\ \\text{W} = 10^{-3}\\ \\text{J/s}\n$$\nSo, the irradiance can be expressed as:\n$$\nE = 100\\ \\text{mW/cm}^2 = 100 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{J/s/cm}^2 = 0.1\\ \\text{J/s/cm}^2\n$$\nNow we can compute the exposure time $\\Delta t$ in seconds:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{75\\ \\text{J/cm}^2}{0.1\\ \\text{J/s/cm}^2} = \\frac{75}{0.1}\\ \\text{s} = 750\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in minutes.

The problem is objective, complete, and contains no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Derivation of the Expression for $I(z)$**\n\nThe governing equation is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\Phi}{dz^{2}}-\\mu_{\\text{eff}}^{2}\\,\\Phi(z)=0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\mu_{\\text{eff}}^{2} = 0$, which has two distinct real roots, $r = \\pm\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$.\nThe general solution for the fluence rate $\\Phi(z)$ is therefore a linear combination of exponential functions:\n$$\n\\Phi(z) = A \\exp(\\mu_{\\text{eff}} z) + B \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{eff}} z)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nWe have two boundary conditions. The first is a physical constraint imposed by the semi-infinite nature of the medium. The fluence rate $\\Phi(z)$ must remain physically meaningful, i.e., finite, as the depth $z$ approaches infinity. The term $\\exp(\\mu_{\\text{eff}} z)$ diverges as $z \\to \\infty$ because $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$ is a positive real number (representing attenuation). To prevent an infinite fluence rate deep within the tissue, the coefficient $A$ must be zero.\n$$\nA = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies the solution to:\n$$\n\\Phi(z) = B \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{eff}} z)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is given at the surface, $z=0$:\n$$\n\\Phi(0) = \\Phi_{0}\n$$\nApplying this to our simplified solution:\n$$\n\\Phi(0) = B \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot 0) = B \\exp(0) = B \\cdot 1 = B\n$$\nThus, we find that $B = \\Phi_{0}$.\nSubstituting the value of $B$ back into the solution for $\\Phi(z)$, we get:\n$$\n\\Phi(z) = \\Phi_{0} \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{eff}} z)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless fraction $I(z)$, which is defined as $I(z) \\equiv \\Phi(z)/\\Phi_{0}$.

We convert the depth $z$ from millimeters to centimeters:\n$$\nz = 2\\,\\text{mm} = 0.2\\,\\text{cm}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the dimensionless product in the exponent:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{eff}} z = (5\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) \\times (0.2\\,\\text{cm}) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $I(z)$:\n$$\nI(z=2\\,\\text{mm}) = \\exp(-1)\n$$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$\nI(2\\,\\text{mm}) \\approx 0.36787944...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$\nI(2\\,\\text{mm}) \\approx 0.3679\n$$\n\n**Qualitative Justification**\n\nThe computed fraction $I(z=2\\,\\text{mm}) \\approx 0.3679$ signifies that the light fluence rate at a depth of $2\\,\\text{mm}$ is only about $37\\%$ of the fluence rate at the surface. Whether this is sufficient for therapy must be analyzed from the first principles of PDT.\n\nThe cytotoxic effect of PDT is mediated by singlet oxygen ($^{1}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$), which is generated through a photochemical reaction involving a photosensitizer, light (photons), and molecular oxygen ($\\text{O}_{2}$). The rate of singlet oxygen production at any point in the tissue is proportional to the local photon fluence rate, $\\Phi(z)$.\n\nA crucial concept in pharmacology and toxicology, which applies to PDT, is the dose-response relationship. PDT exhibits a distinct threshold effect. For cytotoxicity to occur, the cumulative amount of generated singlet oxygen—the photodynamic dose—must exceed a certain threshold value. Below this threshold, cell damage is negligible and repairable, and no effective tumor destruction occurs.\n\nThe problem states that the surface fluence is set to achieve \"adequate activation at the epidermis\" ($z=0$). This implies that the photodynamic dose delivered to the surface is at, or just modestly above, the required therapeutic threshold. Given this, a reduction in the fluence rate to $37\\%$ of its surface value at a depth of $2\\,\\text{mm}$ will cause a corresponding proportional reduction in the rate of singlet oxygen generation. This substantial decrease of $63\\%$ makes it exceedingly unlikely that the photodynamic dose at the $2\\,\\text{mm}$ depth will reach the cytotoxic threshold.\n\nTherefore, from first principles, the fluence rate at a depth of $2\\,\\text{mm}$ is not likely to be sufficient to induce the necessary level of cytotoxicity to treat the nodular BCC. To effectively treat a tumor at this depth, the surface irradiance would need to be increased significantly to compensate for the exponential attenuation. However, this would deliver a very high, likely supratherapeutic dose to the overlying healthy epidermis and dermis, leading to unacceptable collateral damage such as severe burns and necrosis.
