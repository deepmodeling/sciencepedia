The quantities, units (Units, milliliters), and procedural steps are consistent with established practices in medicine and pharmacology. The underlying principles of solution concentration and dose calculation are fundamental to chemistry and pharmacy.

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the concentration of the reconstituted solution and the dose contained in a specific aliquot.\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the solution. Concentration, denoted by $C$, is defined as the amount of solute per unit volume of the solution.\nLet $U_{\\text{total}}$ be the total amount of onabotulinumtoxinA, and let $V_{\\text{solution}}$ be the final volume of the homogeneous solution.\nThe concentration is given by the formula:\n$$C = \\frac{U_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{solution}}}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, $U_{\\text{total}} = 100$ Units.\nThe volume of the solution, $V_{\\text{solution}}$, is the volume of the diluent, $V_{\\text{saline}}$, as the volume contribution from the lyophilized powder is stated to be negligible.\nThus, $V_{\\text{solution}} = V_{\\text{saline}} = 2.0$ milliliters.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the concentration formula:\n$$C = \\frac{100 \\text{ Units}}{2.0 \\text{ mL}}$$\n$$C = 50 \\text{ Units/mL}$$\nThe problem explicitly instructs to round the final answer to three significant figures. Therefore, the concentration is reported as $50.0$ Units/mL.\n\nSecond, we determine the dose contained in the withdrawn aliquot. The dose, denoted by $D$, is the amount of active substance in a given volume. It is calculated by multiplying the concentration of the solution by the volume of the aliquot.\nLet $V_{\\text{aliquot}}$ be the volume of the aliquot.\nThe dose is given by the formula:\n$$D = C \\times V_{\\text{aliquot}}$$\nUsing the calculated concentration $C = 50$ Units/mL and the given aliquot volume $V_{\\text{aliquot}} = 0.050$ milliliters:\n$$D = (50 \\text{ Units/mL}) \\times (0.050 \\text{ mL})$$\n$$D = 2.5 \\text{ Units}$$\nAgain, adhering to the instruction to round the final answer to three significant figures, the dose is reported as $2.50$ Units.\n\nThe final answers are the concentration, $50.0$ Units/mL, and the dose, $2.50$ Units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 50.0 & 2.50 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4423129"}, {"introduction": "Selecting the appropriate soft tissue filler requires a sophisticated understanding of its material properties and how they predict performance within tissue.
