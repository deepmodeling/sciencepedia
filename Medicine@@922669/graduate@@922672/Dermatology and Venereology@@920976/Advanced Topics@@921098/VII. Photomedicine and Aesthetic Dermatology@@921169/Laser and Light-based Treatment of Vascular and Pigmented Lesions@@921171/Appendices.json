For a highly scattering medium where scattering events dominate absorption ($\\mu_s \\gg \\mu_a$) and scattering is predominantly forward-peaked, the RTE can be simplified to the diffusion equation. This approximation models the propagation of photon density as a diffusion process.\n\nThe first step is to account for the anisotropy of scattering. The anisotropy factor $g$ is the average cosine of the scattering angle. A value of $g=0$ represents isotropic scattering, while $g=1$ represents complete forward scattering. To simplify the anisotropic scattering problem to an equivalent isotropic one, the reduced scattering coefficient, $\\mu_s'$, is introduced.
