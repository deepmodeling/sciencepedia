The area-averaged transmittance is the expected value of this function over the distribution of $M_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = E\\left[\\exp(-k_{\\ast} M_{\\mathrm{tot}})\\right] = E\\left[\\exp\\left(-k_{\\ast}((1-r)M_{1} + M_{2})\\right)\\right]$$\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can write:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = E\\left[\\exp(-k_{\\ast}(1-r)M_{1}) \\cdot \\exp(-k_{\\ast}M_{2})\\right]$$\nSince $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are independent random variables, the expectation of the product of functions of these variables is the product of their individual expectations:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = E\\left[\\exp(-k_{\\ast}(1-r)M_{1})\\right] \\cdot E\\left[\\exp(-k_{\\ast}M_{2})\\right]$$\nThis expression involves the moment-generating function (MGF) of the random variables $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. The MGF of a random variable $X$ is defined as $M_X(t) = E[\\exp(tX)]$.\nThus, we can write:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = M_{M_1}(-k_{\\ast}(1-r)) \\cdot M_{M_2}(-k_{\\ast})$$\nWe must first determine the parameters of the gamma distributions for $M_1$ and $M_2$.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to evaluate the given statements, provided that \"general...regulatory principles\" is interpreted to include well-established, specific public-domain values such as the FDA's critical wavelength threshold or the EU's UVA-PF/SPF ratio, which is a reasonable interpretation for an expert in the field. The problem exhibits no scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the SPF-Thickness Relationship\nThe Sun Protection Factor, $\\mathrm{SPF}$, is the factor by which exposure time to a constant source of UV radiation can be increased before reaching the minimal erythema dose (MED), compared to unprotected skin. It can be shown from the definitions provided that the SPF is the reciprocal of the erythemally weighted transmittance, $T$.\n\nLet $E$ be the erythemally effective irradiance. The dose is irradiance multiplied by time, $\\tau$.\nThe MED on unprotected skin, $\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{unprotected}}$, is reached at time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{unprotected}}$, so $\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{unprotected}} = E \\times \\tau_{\\mathrm{unprotected}}$.\nOn protected skin, the transmitted irradiance is $E \\times T$. To reach the same biological endpoint (the MED), the dose reaching the skin must be the same: $(E \\times T) \\times \\tau_{\\mathrm{protected}} = \\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{unprotected}}$.\nThe dose incident on the protected skin to achieve this is $\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{protected}} = E \\times \\tau_{\\mathrm{protected}}$.\nFrom the second equation, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{protected}} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{unprotected}}}{E \\times T}$.\nSubstituting this into the third equation gives $\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{protected}} = E \\times \\left( \\dfrac{\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{unprotected}}}{E \\times T} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{unprotected}}}{T}$.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{SPF} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{protected}}}{\\mathrm{MED}_{\\mathrm{unprotected}}} = \\dfrac{1}{T}$.\n\nGiven the transmittance model $T = e^{-k t}$, we have $\\mathrm{SPF}(t) = \\dfrac{1}{e^{-kt}} = e^{kt}$.\nThe labeled SPF, let's call it $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}}$, is measured at a standard thickness $t_0 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$.\nSo, $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}} = e^{k t_0}$. Taking the natural logarithm gives $\\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}}) = k t_0$, or $k = \\dfrac{\\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}})}{t_0}$.\n\nThe effective SPF, $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, at some other applied thickness $t_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is given by $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = e^{k t_{\\mathrm{app}}}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $k$:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = e^{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}})}{t_0}\\right) t_{\\mathrm{app}}} = e^{\\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}}) \\times (t_{\\mathrm{app}}/t_0)} = \\left(e^{\\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}})}\\right)^{t_{\\mathrm{app}}/t_0} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}})^{t_{\\mathrm{app}}/t_0} $$\nThis fundamental relationship will be used to evaluate options A and B.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Under the exponential attenuation model, applying a product labeled $\\mathrm{SPF}\\,50$ at $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$ (instead of the standardized $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$) yields an effective $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 50^{0.4}$, which is approximately $5$.**\n\nUsing the derived formula with $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}} = 50$, $t_{\\mathrm{app}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$, and $t_0 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$:\nThe exponent is $\\dfrac{t_{\\mathrm{app}}}{t_0} = \\dfrac{0.8}{2.0} = 0.4$.\nThe effective SPF is $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (50)^{0.4}$. The first part of the statement is correct.\nNow, we must evaluate the numerical value:\n$\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 50^{0.4} = 50^{2/5} = \\sqrt[5]{50^2} = \\sqrt[5]{2500}$.\nTo approximate this, we know $4^5 = 1024$ and $5^5 = 3125$. Since $2500$ is closer to $3125$ than to $1024$, the value is closer to $5$ than $4$.\nMore precisely, using logarithms: $\\log_{10}(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = 0.4 \\log_{10}(50) = 0.4 \\times \\log_{10}(100/2) = 0.4 \\times (\\log_{10}(100) - \\log_{10}(2)) \\approx 0.4 \\times (2 - 0.301) = 0.4 \\times 1.699 = 0.6796$.\nThe result is $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 10^{0.6796}$.\nFor comparison, $\\log_{10}(5) = \\log_{10}(10/2) = 1 - \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 1 - 0.301 = 0.699$.\nThe values are very close. A calculator gives $50^{0.4} \\approx 4.78$. So, \"approximately $5$\" is a reasonable approximation. The statement is consistent with the provided model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Improving cosmetic elegance such that the median applied thickness increases from $1.0$ to $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$ for a product labeled $\\mathrm{SPF}\\,30$ increases $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ approximately linearly from about $15$ to about $22.5$.**\n\nThis statement makes two claims: that the relationship is approximately linear, and it provides specific values based on this linearity.\nThe derived relationship is $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}})^{t_{\\mathrm{app}}/t_0}$, which is an exponential function of $t_{\\mathrm{app}}$, not a linear one. The statement's premise of linearity contradicts the exponential attenuation model.\nLet's check the numerical values claimed against the correct exponential model.\nHere, $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{lab}} = 30$ and $t_0 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$.\nFor $t_{\\mathrm{app},1} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$:\n$\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff},1} = (30)^{1.0/2.0} = 30^{0.5} = \\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.48$.\nThe statement claims this value is \"about $15$\". This is incorrect. The value $15$ comes from an incorrect linear assumption ($ \\mathrm{SPF}_{eff} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SPF}_{lab}}{t_0} t_{app} = \\frac{30}{2} \\times 1 = 15 $).\nFor $t_{\\mathrm{app},2} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/cm^2}$:\n$\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{eff},2} = (30)^{1.5/2.0} = 30^{0.75} = 30^{3/4} \\approx 12.8$.\nThe statement claims this value is \"about $22.5$\". This is also incorrect. The value $22.5$ comes from the incorrect linear assumption ($15 \\times 1.5 = 22.5$).\nSince the statement incorrectly assumes a linear relationship and the calculated values are wrong, the statement is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In the United States FDA labeling framework, the “Broad Spectrum” designation requires a critical wavelength of at least $370\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and does not by itself impose a minimum ratio of $\\text{UVA-PF}$ to labeled $\\mathrm{SPF}$.**\n\nThis statement pertains to specific regulatory principles.\nThe first part claims the FDA \"Broad Spectrum\" test requires a critical wavelength ($\\lambda_c$) of at least $370\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This is a correct statement of the regulation established in the FDA's 2011 Final Rule on sunscreen labeling.\nThe second part claims this framework does not impose a minimum UVA-PF/SPF ratio. This is also correct. The problem statement itself contrasts the US \"critical wavelength threshold\" with the EU's \"minimum proportion of the labeled SPF\", supporting this distinction. The US FDA framework ensures a degree of UVA protection across the spectrum but does not use the specific ratio metric required in the EU. Both parts of the statement are factually correct regulatory principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In the European Union, the “UVA in a circle” logo may be used when $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge \\dfrac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{SPF}$, typically determined by the persistent pigment darkening method; therefore, a product labeled $\\mathrm{SPF}\\,50$ must provide $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge 16.\\overline{6}$.**\n\nThis statement describes the EU regulatory standard for UVA protection claims.\nThe first clause, that the logo requires $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge \\dfrac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{SPF}$, is a correct statement of the European Commission recommendation. The problem statement mentions a \"minimum proportion,\" and this option correctly identifies it as one-third.\nThe second clause, that this is typically determined by the PPD method, is also correct. PPD is the standard *in vivo* method for measuring UVA-PF.\nThe third clause is a direct calculation based on the principle: for a product labeled $\\mathrm{SPF}\\,50$, the requirement is $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge \\dfrac{1}{3} \\times 50 = \\dfrac{50}{3} = 16.666... = 16.\\overline{6}$.\nThe calculation is correct, and the entire statement accurately applies the relevant regulatory principle.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. A “water-resistant ($80$ min)” claim in the United States indicates that the product’s labeled SPF approximately doubles after $80$ minutes of continuous water immersion, provided no towel-drying occurs.**\n\nThis statement misinterprets the meaning of a \"water-resistant\" claim. A sunscreen's efficacy is expected to decrease, not increase, upon exposure to water due to wash-off. The purpose of water resistance testing is to demonstrate that the product *retains* its claimed SPF level *after* a specified period of water immersion ($40$ or $80$ minutes). The SPF is measured after the water exposure procedure, and it must still meet the labeled value. The claim that the SPF \"doubles\" is physically implausible and contrary to the regulatory intent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. The “PA++++” rating in the Japanese system guarantees that $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge 30$, which always exceeds the EU “one-third of SPF” criterion for any labeled $\\mathrm{SPF} \\le 90$.**\n\nThis statement contains a factual error in its premise and a logical error in its conclusion.\nFirst, the premise: The Japanese \"PA\" system, as of its latest update, defines \"PA++++\" for products with a UVA Protection Factor (UVA-PF, measured by PPD) of $16$ or greater, not $30$. So, the statement \"guarantees that $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge 30$\" is factually incorrect.\nSecond, let's analyze the conclusion even with the faulty premise. If \"PA++++\" meant $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge 30$, we would compare this to the EU criterion of $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{SPF}$ for $\\mathrm{SPF} \\le 90$. The statement claims the Japanese requirement \"always exceeds\" the EU requirement. At the boundary case of $\\mathrm{SPF}=90$, the EU requirement is $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge \\frac{1}{3} \\times 90 = 30$. In this case, a requirement of $\\ge 30$ is equal to, but does not \"exceed\", the EU requirement. Therefore, the conclusion is logically false due to the boundary condition.\nUsing the correct premise ($\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge 16$ for PA++++), the statement is even more clearly false. For an $\\mathrm{SPF}\\,60$ product, the EU requires $\\text{UVA-PF} \\ge \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20$. A product with $\\text{UVA-PF} = 18$ would qualify for a PA++++ rating but would fail to meet the EU criterion for an SPF 60 product.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "4486271"}]}
