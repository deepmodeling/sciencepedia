You will practice applying fundamental concepts of population genetics, including allele frequency and incomplete penetrance, to a real-world dermatological condition.", "problem": "In ichthyosis vulgaris, loss-of-function variants in the filaggrin gene (FLG) produce a phenotype through impaired stratum corneum barrier formation. Consider a closed, randomly mating population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), where the minor allele frequency of the FLG loss-of-function is $p=0.08$. Assume that clinically manifest disease in heterozygous carriers (one loss-of-function allele) exhibits incomplete penetrance with penetrance $f=0.6$, defined as the probability that a heterozygote expresses clinically appreciable scaling and xerosis attributable to FLG haploinsufficiency. Starting from the fundamental HWE law for genotype frequencies and the definition of penetrance as the conditional probability of phenotype given genotype, derive the expected population prevalence of clinically manifest heterozygotes as a decimal proportion and then compute its numerical value. Round your numerical answer to four significant figures. Finally, explain qualitatively, using first principles of population genetics, how deviations from HWE caused by assortative mating on skin-dryness phenotype would modify the heterozygote prevalence estimate without performing any new numerical calculation.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in population genetics and medical genetics, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, let us define the alleles and their frequencies. Let $a$ represent the loss-of-function allele of the filaggrin gene ($FLG$), and let $A$ represent the wild-type allele. The problem states that the frequency of the minor allele, which is the loss-of-function allele, is $p = 0.08$.\nThe frequency of the wild-type allele, denoted by $q$, must therefore be:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the population is at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). According to the HWE principle, for a locus with two alleles, the genotype frequencies in the population are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$:\n- Frequency of homozygous wild-type genotype $(AA)$: $\\text{freq}(AA) = q^2$\n- Frequency of heterozygous genotype $(Aa)$: $\\text{freq}(Aa) = 2pq$\n- Frequency of homozygous loss-of-function genotype $(aa)$: $\\text{freq}(aa) = p^2$\n\nThe problem asks for the prevalence of clinically manifest heterozygotes. This requires calculating the frequency of the heterozygous genotype $(Aa)$ and then applying the penetrance factor.\nThe frequency of heterozygous carriers in the population is:\n$$\\text{freq}(Aa) = 2pq = 2 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.92 = 0.1472$$\n\nPenetrance, $f$, is defined as the conditional probability of an individual expressing a phenotype, given that they have a particular genotype. In this case, the penetrance for heterozygotes is given as $f = 0.6$. This means that $60\\%$ of individuals with the $Aa$ genotype will exhibit clinically manifest disease.\n$$f = P(\\text{phenotype} | \\text{genotype}) = P(\\text{manifest disease} | Aa) = 0.6$$\n\nThe population prevalence of clinically manifest heterozygotes is the joint probability of an individual being heterozygous AND expressing the phenotype. This is found by multiplying the frequency of the heterozygous genotype by the penetrance of that genotype:\n$$\\text{Prevalence} = P(\\text{manifest disease and } Aa) = P(\\text{manifest disease} | Aa) \\times P(Aa)$$\n$$\\text{Prevalence} = f \\times \\text{freq}(Aa) = f \\times 2pq$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into this derived expression:\n$$\\text{Prevalence} = 0.6 \\times (2 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.92)$$\n$$\\text{Prevalence} = 0.6 \\times 0.1472 = 0.08832$$\n\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.08832$. The significant figures of this number are the digits starting from the first non-zero digit from the left, which are $8, 8, 3, 2$. This number thus has exactly four significant figures. Therefore, no rounding is required. The numerical value is $0.08832$.\n\nNext, we must explain qualitatively how assortative mating would modify the heterozygote prevalence estimate. Assortative mating is a form of non-random mating where individuals with similar phenotypes mate more frequently than would be expected by chance. In this context, it would mean that individuals with the \"skin-dryness phenotype\" preferentially mate with other individuals who also have dry skin.\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is built upon the core assumption of random mating. Assortative mating violates this assumption. According to the first principles of population genetics, positive assortative mating (mating of like with like) leads to an increase in the proportion of homozygous genotypes ($AA$ and $aa$) and a corresponding decrease in the proportion of heterozygous genotypes ($Aa$) at the locus responsible for the phenotype, compared to the frequencies expected under HWE.\n\nThis occurs because mating becomes stratified. Matings that are most efficient at producing heterozygotes (i.e., between opposite homozygous types, $AA \\times aa$) become rarer, as these individuals are in different phenotypic pools. Matings within the affected group (e.g., $Aa \\times Aa$, $Aa \\times aa$) and within the unaffected group (e.g., $AA \\times AA$, $AA \\times Aa$) become more common. While $Aa \\times Aa$ matings produce heterozygotes, they also produce homozygotes, and the net effect across the population is a reduction in heterozygosity.\n\nTherefore, if positive assortative mating based on the skin-dryness phenotype were occurring in this population, the frequency of heterozygous individuals, $\\text{freq}(Aa)$, would be lower than the $2pq$ value calculated under the HWE assumption. Consequently, the expected population prevalence of clinically manifest heterozygotes ($f \\times \\text{freq}(Aa)$) would also be lower than our computed value of $0.08832$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.08832}$$", "id": "4446845"}, {"introduction": "With the genetic basis established, we now explore the mechanistic link between the faulty gene and the resulting skin condition.

It presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of diffusion through the skin's barrier layer, the stratum corneum, based on Fick's first law. The pathophysiological changes described for ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) are consistent with established dermatological science, and the parameters provided are physically plausible. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions, allowing for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by deriving a general expression for transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as a steady-state mass flux. The problem defines TEWL in terms of the molar flux $J(x)$ of water, which is governed by Fick's first law in one dimension:\n$$ J(x) = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nHere, $J$ is the molar flux in units of $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$, $D$ is the constant diffusivity of water in the stratum corneum (SC), and $C(x)$ is the molar concentration of water at a depth $x$ within the SC.\n\nAt steady state, the flux $J$ must be constant with respect to position $x$ to satisfy the continuity equation (mass conservation). Since $D$ is also assumed to be constant, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ must be constant as well. This confirms the problem's assumption of a linear concentration profile.\n\nWe can solve for $J$ by separating variables and integrating across the thickness of the SC, from the aposition $x=0$ (viable epidermis-SC interface) to $x=L$ (outer SC surface):\n$$ J \\int_{0}^{L} dx = -D \\int_{C(0)}^{C(L)} dC $$\n$$ J[x]_{0}^{L} = -D[C]_{C(0)}^{C(L)} $$\n$$ J L = -D(C(L) - C(0)) $$\n$$ J = \\frac{D}{L}(C(0) - C(L)) $$\nThis equation relates the flux to the concentration difference across the SC.\n\nNext, we use the provided constitutive relation, $C(x) = k_{\\mathrm{sc}} a(x)$, where $k_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ is the constant effective solubility coefficient of water in the SC and $a(x)$ is the water activity. We apply this at the boundaries:\n$$ C(0) = k_{\\mathrm{sc}} a(0) $$\n$$ C(L) = k_{\\mathrm{sc}} a(L) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $J$:\n$$ J = \\frac{D}{L}(k_{\\mathrm{sc}} a(0) - k_{\\mathrm{sc}} a(L)) = \\frac{D k_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{L}(a(0) - a(L)) $$\n\nWe now apply the given boundary conditions for water activity: $a(0)=1$ (representing full hydration at the interface with the viable epidermis) and $a(L)=\\phi h$ (where $h$ is the ambient relative humidity and $\\phi$ is a surface microenvironment factor).\n$$ J = \\frac{D k_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{L}(1 - \\phi h) $$\nThe problem defines the mass flux TEWL, denoted here as $\\mathcal{T}$, as $\\mathcal{T} = M_{w}J$, where $M_{w}$ is the molar mass of water.\n$$ \\mathcal{T} = \\frac{M_{w} D k_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{L}(1 - \\phi h) $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for TEWL based on the model.\n\nThe problem requires a mechanistic explanation for how ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) alters the model's parameters.\nThe primary defect in IV is a deficiency of the protein filaggrin. This has two main consequences relevant to the skin barrier:\n1.  **Reduced Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF):** Filaggrin is proteolytically processed into small, hygroscopic molecules that constitute the NMF. NMF helps retain water in the corneocytes, maintaining surface hydration. A deficiency in NMF reduces the skin's ability to bind water at its surface, decreasing its humectancy. In the model, this is captured by the parameter $\\phi$. For normal skin, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1.0$, implying the water activity at the surface fully equilibrates with the ambient humidity. For IV skin, NMF deficiency leads to $\\phi_{\\mathrm{IV}} < 1.0$ (given as $0.90$), reflecting lower surface water activity for the same ambient humidity. This change increases the activity gradient $(1 - \\phi h)$, which acts as the driving force for water loss.\n2.  **Disorganized Lipid Lamellae:** Filaggrin also plays a role in the proper organization of the extracellular lipid lamellae in the SC. These ordered lipids form the principal barrier to water diffusion. In IV, their disorganization creates less tortuous and more permeable pathways for water molecules. This directly increases the effective diffusivity of water through the SC. The model reflects this with an increased diffusivity, $D_{\\mathrm{IV}} > D_{\\mathrm{N}}$, quantified by the factor $\\alpha > 1$.\nAdditionally, IV is often associated with hyperkeratosis, an abnormal thickening of the SC, which is modeled as an increase in thickness, $L_{\\mathrm{IV}} > L_{\\mathrm{N}}$, quantified by the factor $\\lambda > 1$.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $R = \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{IV}} / \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{N}}$. Using our derived expression for $\\mathcal{T}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{N}} = \\frac{M_{w} D_{\\mathrm{N}} k_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{L_{\\mathrm{N}}}(1 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{N}} h) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{IV}} = \\frac{M_{w} D_{\\mathrm{IV}} k_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{L_{\\mathrm{IV}}}(1 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{IV}} h) $$\nThe ratio $R$ is:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{N}}} = \\frac{\\frac{M_{w} D_{\\mathrm{IV}} k_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{L_{\\mathrm{IV}}}(1 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{IV}} h)}{\\frac{M_{w} D_{\\mathrm{N}} k_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{L_{\\mathrm{N}}}(1 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{N}} h)} $$\nThe terms $M_{w}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ cancel, as $k_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ is assumed to be unchanged.\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{D_{\\mathrm{N}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{N}}}{L_{\\mathrm{IV}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{IV}} h}{1 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{N}} h}\\right) $$\nWe are given the relations $D_{\\mathrm{IV}} = \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{N}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{IV}} = \\lambda L_{\\mathrm{N}}$.
