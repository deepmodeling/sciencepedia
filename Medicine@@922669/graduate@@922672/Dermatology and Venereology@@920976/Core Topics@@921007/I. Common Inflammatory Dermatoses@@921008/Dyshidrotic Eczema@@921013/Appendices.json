This will be followed by a clinical interpretation of the result in the context of topical corticosteroid therapy. The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe starting point is Fick's first law of diffusion, which relates the flux $J$ (amount of substance per unit area per unit time) to the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $C$ is the concentration of the solute, and $x$ is the position along the direction of diffusion.\n\nThe problem states several simplifying assumptions:\n1.  **Steady State**: The flux $J$ is constant over time.\n2.  **Constant Diffusion Coefficient**: $D$ is uniform throughout the SC membrane.\n3.  **Linear Concentration Gradient**: The concentration $C$ changes linearly with position $x$ across the SC.\n4.  **Boundary Conditions**: The concentration at the outer surface of the SC (the donor side, $x=0$) is $C_0$, and the concentration at the inner boundary with the viable epidermis (at $x=L$, where $L$ is the SC thickness) is approximately zero ($C_{\\mathrm{ve}} \\approx 0$), as the viable epidermis acts as a \"perfect sink\".\n\nUnder the assumption of a linear concentration gradient, the derivative $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ can be replaced by the finite difference ratio $\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x}$ over the thickness of the SC.\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{C(L) - C(0)}{L - 0}$$\nUsing the given boundary conditions, $C(0) = C_{0}$ and $C(L) = C_{\\mathrm{ve}} \\approx 0$:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{0 - C_{0}}{L} = -\\frac{C_{0}}{L}$$\nSubstituting this expression for the concentration gradient back into Fick's first law:\n$$J = -D \\left( -\\frac{C_{0}}{L} \\right)$$\nThis yields the expression for the steady-state flux through the stratum corneum:\n$$J = \\frac{D C_{0}}{L}$$\nThis equation shows that the flux is directly proportional to the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the applied concentration $C_0$, and inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane $L$. The term $\\frac{D}{L}$ is often defined as the permeability coefficient, $k_p$.\n\nNext, we apply this general formula to the two specific sites: palmar and facial skin. The problem states that the corticosteroid is applied under \"identical conditions,\" which implies that the concentration of the applied formulation, $C_0$, is the same for both sites.\n\nFor palmar skin, the flux is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{palmar}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{palmar}} C_{0}}{L_{\\mathrm{palmar}}}$$\nFor facial skin, the flux is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{facial}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{facial}} C_{0}}{L_{\\mathrm{facial}}}$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{palmar}}}{J_{\\mathrm{facial}}}$. We can write this as:\n$$R = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{palmar}} C_{0}}{L_{\\mathrm{palmar}}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{facial}} C_{0}}{L_{\\mathrm{facial}}} \\right)}$$\nThe term $C_0$ cancels out, demonstrating that the ratio of fluxes is independent of the applied concentration, provided it is the same at both sites.\n$$R = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{palmar}}}{L_{\\mathrm{palmar}}} \\cdot \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{facial}}}{D_{\\mathrm{facial}}} = \\left( \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{palmar}}}{D_{\\mathrm{facial}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{facial}}}{L_{\\mathrm{palmar}}} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $L_{\\mathrm{palmar}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $L_{\\mathrm{facial}} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{palmar}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{facial}} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nLet's compute the two ratios separately first.\nThe ratio of the diffusion coefficients is:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{palmar}}}{D_{\\mathrm{facial}}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}{16 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\frac{4}{16} = 0.25$$\nThe ratio of the thicknesses is:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{facial}}}{L_{\\mathrm{palmar}}} = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-5}}{40 \\times 10^{-5}} = \\frac{1.6}{40} = \\frac{16}{400} = \\frac{4}{100} = 0.04$$\nNow, we multiply these two results to find the final ratio $R$:\n$$R = (0.25) \\times (0.04) = 0.01$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R = 0.0100$$\nThe ratio $R$ is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\nFinally, we interpret the clinical implication of this result. The calculated ratio $R = 0.0100$ indicates that the steady-state flux of the corticosteroid through the palmar stratum corneum is only $1\\%$ of the flux through the facial stratum corneum, given identical application conditions. This hundred-fold difference in drug penetration provides a quantitative rationale for fundamental principles of topical dermatologic therapy.\n\nThe palmar skin, with its very thick stratum corneum ($400\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ in this model) and lower diffusion coefficient, forms a formidable barrier to drug absorption. To treat inflammatory conditions like dyshidrotic eczema on the palms, a therapeutically effective concentration of the corticosteroid must reach the target cells in the epidermis and dermis. Due to the extremely low flux, a much higher driving force is needed. In clinical practice, this is achieved by using very high-potency (e.g., Class I) corticosteroids and sometimes occlusive dressings to enhance penetration.\n\nConversely, the facial skin, being much thinner ($16\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ in this model) and more permeable, allows for significantly greater drug absorption. The high flux means that even low-potency corticosteroids can achieve therapeutic levels readily. Using high-potency steroids on the face would lead to excessive absorption, increasing the risk of local side effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasias, and steroid-induced rosacea, as well as potential systemic side effects. Therefore, clinicians select low-potency (e.g., Class VI or VII) corticosteroids for facial dermatoses and restrict their use to short durations.\n\nIn summary, the biophysical model quantitatively demonstrates that the palmar skin is approximately $100$ times less permeable to the corticosteroid than facial skin. This large disparity in absorption directly justifies the clinical practice of using the most potent topical corticosteroids for palmar dermatoses like dyshidrotic eczema and the least potent formulations for the face.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0100}$$", "id": "4437294"}, {"introduction": "While potent topical corticosteroids are necessary to control palmoplantar eczema, their use requires a careful consideration of potential adverse effects.
