Treat the presence of this pattern as a binary diagnostic test for pityriasis alba. Based on a well-conducted observational study in the same clinic population, the test has sensitivity $Se=0.85$, specificity $Sp=0.90$, and the clinic’s point prevalence of pityriasis alba among children with facial hypopigmented patches is $P=0.20$. \n\nStarting only from the core definitions of sensitivity ($Se$), specificity ($Sp$), prevalence ($P$), and Bayes’ theorem for conditional probabilities, derive an analytic expression for the positive predictive value (PPV) of this clinical pattern as a function of $Se$, $Sp$, and $P$, then compute its numerical value using the given parameters. Briefly articulate the clinical meaning of this value in the context of deciding whether to label the lesion as pityriasis alba at the point of care.\n\nExpress the final numerical value of $PPV$ as a decimal (not a percentage) and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and diagnostic test evaluation, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a child has pityriasis alba, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the child does not have the disease. Let $T$ be the event that the diagnostic test is positive, meaning the characteristic morphological pattern is observed. Consequently, $T^c$ is the event that the test is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following quantities:\n1.  The prevalence of the disease, $P$, which is the prior probability of a child having the disease:\n    $$P(D) = P = 0.20$$\n    From this, the probability of not having the disease is:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, $Se$, which is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present:\n    $$Se = P(T|D) = 0.85$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the test, $Sp$, which is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent:\n    $$Sp = P(T^c|D^c) = 0.90$$\n    From this, we can determine the probability of a positive test in a disease-free individual (the false positive rate), which is:\n    $$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). The PPV is defined as the probability that a child actually has the disease given that the test is positive. In probabilistic notation, this is $P(D|T)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem, which defines this conditional probability:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T)$, represents the total probability of a positive test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability, considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios: having the disease or not having the disease.\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the terms for sensitivity ($Se$), specificity ($Sp$), and prevalence ($P$):\n$$P(T) = (Se)(P) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)$$\n\nSubstituting this expanded expression for $P(T)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $P(D|T)$, we obtain the desired analytic expression for the PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{(Se)(P)}{(Se)(P) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)}$$\n\nThis is the analytic expression for the PPV as a function of $Se$, $Sp$, and $P$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the given parameters: $Se=0.85$, $Sp=0.90$, and $P=0.20$.\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.20)}{(0.85)(0.20) + (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.20)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\nNumerator:\n$$(0.85)(0.20) = 0.17$$\nDenominator, first term:\n$$(0.85)(0.20) = 0.17$$\nDenominator, second term:\n$$(1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.20) = (0.10)(0.80) = 0.08$$\nSumming the terms in the denominator:\n$$P(T) = 0.17 + 0.08 = 0.25$$\nFinally, we compute the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.17}{0.25} = 0.68$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, $0.68$ is expressed as $0.6800$.\n\nThe clinical meaning of this value, $PPV=0.68$, is that for a child within this specific clinic population who presents with the described hypopigmented facial patches (a positive test), there is a $68\\%$ probability that the diagnosis of pityriasis alba is correct. Conversely, there is a $32\\%$ probability ($1 - 0.68 = 0.32$) that the child does not have pityriasis alba, and the patches are a false positive result due to another condition. This quantifies the post-test probability of disease, moving from a pre-test probability (prevalence) of $20\\%$ to a post-test probability of $68\\%$. This information is crucial for the clinician at the point of care. While a $68\\%$ certainty is substantially higher than the initial prevalence, it is not definitive. It may support a decision to provide reassurance and simple emollients, as is typical for pityriasis alba, but it also alerts the clinician to the significant chance of an alternative diagnosis, warranting follow-up or reconsideration if the patches behave atypically.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6800}$$", "id": "4480254"}, {"introduction": "Clinicians frequently observe that certain conditions, such as pityriasis alba and atopy, seem to occur together, but moving beyond this observation to quantify the relationship is a key scientific skill.

By working through this hypothetical cohort data, you will gain hands-on experience in a core method used to substantiate clinical hypotheses with statistical evidence.", "problem": "A dermatology research team is investigating the association between atopy and pityriasis alba in school-aged children. In a population-based cohort of $200$ children examined during a single season, the presence of pityriasis alba and a physician-confirmed atopic diathesis were recorded.

The variables (pityriasis alba, atopy) are well-defined medical conditions. The provided numerical data are internally consistent. Let's construct a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table to verify this. Let $A$ denote the presence of atopy and $PA$ denote the presence of pityriasis alba.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Cell $a$ (children with $A$ and $PA$): $a = N_{PA \\cap A} = 24$.\n- Marginal total for $A$: $a+c = N_A = 100$. This implies $c = 100 - 24 = 76$.\n- Marginal total for $PA$: $a+b = N_{PA} = 30$. This implies $b = 30 - 24 = 6$.\n- The total population is $N=200$. The number of children without atopy is $N - N_A = 200 - 100 = 100$. This corresponds to the marginal total $b+d = 100$, so $d = 100 - b = 100 - 6 = 94$.\n- We can cross-check the marginal total for children without pityriasis alba: $c+d = 76 + 94 = 170$. The total number of children without pityriasis alba should be $N - N_{PA} = 200 - 30 = 170$. The counts are consistent.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of data. Therefore, it is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\nTo compute the odds ratio for pityriasis alba ($PA$) in children with atopy ($A$) relative to children without atopy (not $A$), we first organize the data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. The exposure is atopy and the outcome is pityriasis alba.\n\nThe cells of the table are defined as:\n- $a$: Number of children with both $PA$ and $A$.\n- $b$: Number of children with $PA$ but without $A$.\n- $c$: Number of children without $PA$ but with $A$.\n- $d$: Number of children without either $PA$ or $A$.\n\nBased on the validation step, the table is as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n & \\text{Atopy (+)} & \\text{Atopy (-)} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n \\hline\n\\text{Pityriasis Alba (+)} & a = 24 & b = 6 & 30 \\\\\n\\text{Pityriasis Alba (-)} & c = 76 & d = 94 & 170 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & 100 & 100 & 200\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the odds ratio for pityriasis alba in the atopic group relative to the non-atopic group. We must calculate the odds of pityriasis alba within each stratum (atopic and non-atopic).\n\nFollowing the provided definition, the odds of an event is the ratio of the number of individuals with the event to the number of individuals without the event within a given stratum.\n\n1.  **Odds of pityriasis alba in the atopic group ($A+$):**\n    This stratum consists of children with atopy.

The first four significant figures are $4$, $9$, $4$, and $7$. The fifth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$ OR \\approx 4.947 $$\nThis result indicates that the odds of having pityriasis alba are approximately $4.947$ times higher among children with atopy compared to those without atopy in this cohort.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.947}$$", "id": "4480261"}, {"introduction": "When a clinical trial reports that a treatment is effective, it is crucial for the clinician to understand the magnitude of that benefit in practical terms.
