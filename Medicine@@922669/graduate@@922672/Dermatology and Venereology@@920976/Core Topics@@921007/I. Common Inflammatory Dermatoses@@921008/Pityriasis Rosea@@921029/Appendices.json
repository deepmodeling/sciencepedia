Point prevalence is the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population of interest has the condition at a specified time. Under the assumptions in the problem, the point prevalence for pityriasis rosea (PR) among clinic attendees is $p=0.0015$. For each new patient $i$, we define the indicator random variable $Y_i$ such that $Y_i=1$ if the patient has PR and $Y_i=0$ otherwise. By the definition of point prevalence, we have $\\Pr(Y_i=1)=p$ and $\\Pr(Y_i=0)=1-p$, so $Y_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$.\n\nThe total number of PR cases among new patients in the year is\n$$\nX=\\sum_{i=1}^{1{,}000} Y_i.\n$$\nWe seek the expected value $\\mathbb{E}[X]$.

Because secondary syphilis is a critical alternative diagnosis, the clinician estimates the pretest probability of active syphilis as $0.10$ based on history and examination. A Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test is performed and returns negative. Assume the RPR has sensitivity $0.86$ and specificity $0.98$ for active syphilis in this clinical context. Using only Bayes’ theorem and the standard definitions of sensitivity and specificity as foundational principles, compute the post-test probability of active syphilis given a negative RPR result.

Let $S^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have active syphilis.\nLet $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test result, and $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The pretest probability of active syphilis is given as $P(S) = 0.10$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the RPR test is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present: $P(T^{+} | S) = 0.86$.\n3.  The specificity of the RPR test is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent: $P(T^{-} | S^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom the pretest probability $P(S)$, we can determine the probability that the patient does not have active syphilis:\n$$P(S^c) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of active syphilis given a negative test result, which is denoted as $P(S | T^{-})$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S)}{P(T^{-})}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{-})$, represents the total probability of obtaining a negative test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which involves summing the probabilities of a negative result over all possible disease states (present or absent):\n$$P(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) + P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c)$$\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to determine $P(T^{-} | S)$, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient has syphilis. This quantity is also known as the false negative rate. It is the complement of the sensitivity, $P(T^{+} | S)$, since for a patient with the disease, the test can only be positive or negative.\n$$P(T^{-} | S) = 1 - P(T^{+} | S) = 1 - 0.86 = 0.14$$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the total probability of a negative test, $P(T^{-})$:\nThe first term, $P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S)$, is the probability of a false negative result:\n$$P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) = 0.14 \\times 0.10 = 0.014$$\nThe second term, $P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c)$, is the probability of a true negative result:\n$$P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c) = 0.98 \\times 0.90 = 0.882$$\nThe total probability of a negative test is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(T^{-}) = 0.014 + 0.882 = 0.896$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator, $P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) = 0.014$, and the calculated denominator, $P(T^{-}) = 0.896$, back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{0.014}{0.896}$$\n\nTo express this result as a reduced fraction, we first clear the decimals by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $1000$:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{14}{896}$$\nWe simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. We start by dividing by $2$:\n$$\\frac{14 \\div 2}{896 \\div 2} = \\frac{7}{448}$$\nNext, we check if $448$ is divisible by $7$. Performing the division, $448 \\div 7 = 64$.
