The data provided ($TC$, $HDL$, $TG$) are clinically realistic. The condition for using the Friedewald approximation, $TG  400\\,\\text{mg/dL}$, is satisfied, as the given $TG$ is $250\\,\\text{mg/dL}$. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed to the calculation of $LDL$. The relationship between the cholesterol fractions is given as:\n$$TC \\approx LDL + HDL + VLDL$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $LDL$:\n$$LDL \\approx TC - HDL - VLDL$$\nThe problem provides the formula to estimate $VLDL$ from triglycerides:\n$$VLDL = \\frac{TG}{5}$$\nThis approximation is valid since $TG = 250\\,\\text{mg/dL}$, which is less than the $400\\,\\text{mg/dL}$ threshold.\nFirst, we calculate the $VLDL$ concentration:\n$$VLDL = \\frac{250}{5} = 50\\,\\text{mg/dL}$$\nNow, we can substitute the values of $TC$, $HDL$, and the calculated $VLDL$ into the equation for $LDL$:\n$$LDL \\approx 280 - 40 - 50$$\n$$LDL \\approx 240 - 50$$\n$$LDL \\approx 190\\,\\text{mg/dL}$$\nThe calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is $190\\,\\text{mg/dL}$.\n\nNext, we must infer the most likely xanthoma subtype. This requires correlating the clinical presentation and the lipid profile with known clinicopathologic entities.\nThe lipid profile is:\n- $TC = 280\\,\\text{mg/dL}$ (High; desirable is $ 200$)\n- $LDL = 190\\,\\text{mg/dL}$ (Very High; desirable is $ 100$, high is $\\ge 160$)\n- $HDL = 40\\,\\text{mg/dL}$ (Borderline low)\n- $TG = 250\\,\\text{mg/dL}$ (High; desirable is $ 150$)\nThis profile indicates a mixed hyperlipidemia, with a predominant and severe elevation in LDL cholesterol.\n\nThe clinical findings are:\n- Yellow papules on extensor surfaces.\n- Subtle thickening of the Achilles tendon.\n\nLet us evaluate the options based on these findings:\n- **Eruptive xanthomas (Code 2)** are classically associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia, typically with $TG$ levels exceeding $1000\\,\\text{mg/dL}$. The patient's $TG$ level of $250\\,\\text{mg/dL}$, while high, is not in the range typically seen with eruptive xanthomas.\n- **Tuberous xanthomas (Code 3)** are firm, painless, yellow nodules that can occur over extensor surfaces and pressure points. They are associated with elevated LDL, as seen in familial hypercholesterolemia.\n- **Planar xanthelasma palpebrarum (Code 4)** are yellow plaques confined to the eyelids and periorbital area. The patient's lesions are described on extensor surfaces, not the eyelids.\n- **Tendinous xanthomas (Code 1)** are lipid deposits within tendons, most characteristically the Achilles tendon and the extensor tendons of the hands. They manifest as slowly enlarging subcutaneous nodules or tendon thickening. Their presence is considered virtually pathognomonic for familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder characterized by extremely high levels of LDL cholesterol from birth.\n\nThe patient's presentation includes Achilles tendon thickening, a specific and strong indicator of tendinous xanthomas. This clinical sign, combined with a very high calculated LDL level of $190\\,\\text{mg/dL}$, makes tendinous xanthoma the most likely diagnosis. The \"yellow papules on extensor surfaces\" could be consistent with tuberous xanthomas, which can coexist with tendinous xanthomas in severe hypercholesterolemia, but the Achilles tendon finding points most specifically to the tendinous subtype. Therefore, we select option $1$.\n\nThe final answer requires a $1 \\times 2$ matrix containing the $LDL$ value and the subtype code.\nThe computed $LDL$ is $190$.\nThe inferred subtype code is $1$.\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 190  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 190  1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4500504"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of xanthomas extends beyond diagnosis to monitoring the response to lipid-lowering therapy.
