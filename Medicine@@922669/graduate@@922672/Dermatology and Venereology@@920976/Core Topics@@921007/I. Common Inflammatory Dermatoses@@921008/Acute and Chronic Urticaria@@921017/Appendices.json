Oral H1-receptor antagonists reduce wheal formation by occupying the receptor and thereby reducing the fraction of receptors available to endogenous histamine. Consider a competitive binding scenario in which a drug with free plasma concentration $C$ binds the H1 receptor with dissociation constant $K_{d}$. The binding reaction is $D + R \\rightleftharpoons DR$, and the fraction of receptors occupied by the drug is the receptor occupancy $\\theta$, defined as $\\theta = \\frac{[DR]}{[R] + [DR]}$, where $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors and $[DR]$ is the concentration of drug–receptor complex.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action and the definition of $K_{d}$, derive the analytic form of $\\theta$ as a function of $C$ and $K_{d}$.

The reaction is $D + R \\rightleftharpoons DR$, where $R$ is the H1 receptor.\n- **Concentration:** The free plasma concentration of the drug is $C$.\n- **Dissociation Constant:** The drug-receptor binding is characterized by a dissociation constant $K_{d}$.\n- **Receptor Occupancy ($\\theta$):** Defined as the fraction of receptors occupied by the drug, $\\theta = \\frac{[DR]}{[R] + [DR]}$, where $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors and $[DR]$ is the concentration of the drug-receptor complex.\n- **Clinical Assumption:** Wheal amplitude scales with the fraction of receptors accessible to histamine, which is $1 - \\theta$.\n- **Dose Change Scenario:** Doubling the dose doubles the free concentration from $C$ to $2C$, while $K_{d}$ remains constant.\n- **Required Output:** Derive the expression for the fold-change in receptor occupancy when the concentration increases from $C$ to $2C$, expressed in terms of $C$ and $K_{d}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on the fundamental principles of receptor pharmacology and the law of mass action. The model of competitive antagonism at the H1 receptor is a standard and scientifically sound basis for understanding the mechanism of action of antihistamine drugs used to treat urticaria. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed.

It is a well-defined problem in pharmacodynamics.\n- **Action:** Proceed with a full derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation of Receptor Occupancy ($\\theta$)**\n\nThe equilibrium for the drug-receptor binding reaction $D + R \\rightleftharpoons DR$ is described by the law of mass action. The dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is defined as the ratio of concentrations of products to reactants at equilibrium for the dissociation reaction $DR \\rightleftharpoons D + R$.\n\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[D][R]}{[DR]}$$\n\nThe problem states that the free drug concentration $[D]$ is denoted by $C$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{C[R]}{[DR]}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, which is defined as:\n\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[DR]}{[R] + [DR]}$$\n\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of $C$ and $K_{d}$, we first rearrange the expression for $K_{d}$ to solve for the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_{d}[DR]}{C}$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[DR]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{d}[DR]}{C}\\right) + [DR]}$$\n\nThe term $[DR]$ is a common factor in the denominator and can be factored out:\n\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[DR]}{[DR]\\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{C} + 1\\right)}$$\n\nAssuming a non-zero drug concentration and binding, $[DR] \\neq 0$, so we can cancel this term from the numerator and denominator:\n\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{C} + 1}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $C$:\n\n$$\\theta(C) = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$$\n\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation, which provides the analytic form of receptor occupancy $\\theta$ as a function of drug concentration $C$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$.\n\n**Explanation of the Occupancy Requirement**\n\nThe problem states that wheal amplitude, let's call it $A$, scales with the fraction of receptors accessible to histamine. This fraction is the proportion of receptors not occupied by the drug, which is $1 - \\theta$. Therefore, we can write $A \\propto (1 - \\theta)$. To reduce wheal amplitude below a chosen clinical detectability threshold, $A_{threshold}$, the fraction of available receptors must be reduced below a corresponding fractional threshold.\nMathematically, we require $A < A_{threshold}$, which implies that $1 - \\theta$ must be sufficiently small. The fraction of unoccupied receptors is:\n\n$$1 - \\theta = 1 - \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}} = \\frac{(C + K_{d}) - C}{C + K_{d}} = \\frac{K_{d}}{C + K_{d}}$$\n\nFor the wheal to be clinically undetectable, the drug concentration $C$ must be high enough relative to the dissociation constant $K_{d}$ to drive the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ towards $1$ and, consequently, drive the fraction of available receptors $1 - \\theta$ towards $0$. Specifically, a specific occupancy level $\\theta_{target}$ must be achieved such that the resulting $1 - \\theta_{target}$ corresponds to a wheal amplitude below the detection limit.\n\n**Derivation of the Fold-Change in Receptor Occupancy**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the fold-change in receptor occupancy when the drug concentration is doubled from $C$ to $2C$.\n\nLet $\\theta_1$ be the initial receptor occupancy at concentration $C$. Using our derived formula:\n\n$$\\theta_1 = \\theta(C) = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$$\n\nLet $\\theta_2$ be the new receptor occupancy at concentration $2C$. The dissociation constant $K_{d}$ does not change.\n\n$$\\theta_2 = \\theta(2C) = \\frac{2C}{2C + K_{d}}$$\n\nThe fold-change in receptor occupancy is the ratio of the new occupancy to the original occupancy, $\\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta_1}$.\n\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta_1} = \\frac{\\frac{2C}{2C + K_{d}}}{\\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}}$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we invert the denominator and multiply:\n\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\left(\\frac{2C}{2C + K_{d}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{C + K_{d}}{C}\\right)$$\n\nThe term $C$ in the numerator of the first fraction and the denominator of the second fraction cancels out, provided $C \\neq 0$:\n\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{2(C + K_{d})}{2C + K_{d}}$$\n\nThis is the final, simplified, closed-form analytic expression for the fold-change in receptor occupancy, expressed solely in terms of the initial concentration $C$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2(C + K_{d})}{2C + K_{d}}}$$", "id": "4406624"}, {"introduction": "For patients with CSU refractory to high-dose antihistamines, third-line agents like cyclosporine present a powerful but complex therapeutic option.
