It describes a standard epidemiologic case-control study with all necessary data provided for the calculation of an odds ratio. The definitions supplied are standard and correct. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be formulated.\n\nThe study design is a case-control study. We are given the number of cases (individuals with granuloma annulare) and controls (individuals without granuloma annulare), as well as the number of exposed individuals (those with diabetes mellitus) within each group. Let us organize the provided data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table.\n\nLet GA+ denote the presence of granuloma annulare (cases) and GA- denote its absence (controls).\nLet DM+ denote the presence of diabetes mellitus (exposed) and DM- denote its absence (unexposed).\n\nThe cell counts are defined as follows:\n- $a$: Number of individuals who are GA+ and DM+ (exposed cases).\n- $b$: Number of individuals who are GA- and DM+ (exposed controls).\n- $c$: Number of individuals who are GA+ and DM- (unexposed cases).\n- $d$: Number of individuals who are GA- and DM- (unexposed controls).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- Total cases (GA+): $a+c = 100$\n- Total controls (GA-): $b+d = 150$\n- Exposed cases (GA+ and DM+): $a = 40$\n- Exposed controls (GA- and DM+): $b = 30$\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the counts for the unexposed groups:\n- Unexposed cases (GA+ and DM-): $c = (a+c) - a = 100 - 40 = 60$\n- Unexposed controls (GA- and DM-): $d = (b+d) - b = 150 - 30 = 120$\n\nThe complete $2 \\times 2$ table is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n & \\text{GA+} & \\text{GA-} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{DM+} & a = 40 & b = 30 & 70 \\\\\n\\text{DM-} & c = 60 & d = 120 & 180 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & 100 & 150 & 250\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the odds ratio of exposure (diabetes mellitus) in cases relative to controls. First, we calculate the odds of exposure for the cases.\n\nThe probability of exposure among cases is $P(\\text{DM+}|\\text{GA+}) = \\frac{a}{a+c} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$.\nThe probability of non-exposure among cases is $P(\\text{DM-}|\\text{GA+}) = \\frac{c}{a+c} = \\frac{60}{100} = 0.6$.\nThe odds of exposure among cases is the ratio of these probabilities:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{P(\\text{DM+}|\\text{GA+})}{P(\\text{DM-}|\\text{GA+})} = \\frac{a/(a+c)}{c/(a+c)} = \\frac{a}{c} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the odds of exposure for the controls.\nThe probability of exposure among controls is $P(\\text{DM+}|\\text{GA-}) = \\frac{b}{b+d} = \\frac{30}{150} = 0.2$.\nThe probability of non-exposure among controls is $P(\\text{DM-}|\\text{GA-}) = \\frac{d}{b+d} = \\frac{120}{150} = 0.8$.\nThe odds of exposure among controls is:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{P(\\text{DM+}|\\text{GA-})}{P(\\text{DM-}|\\text{GA-})} = \\frac{b/(b+d)}{d/(b+d)} = \\frac{b}{d} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{30}{120} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n\nThe odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of the odds of exposure in cases to the odds of exposure in controls:\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}}} = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\nThis cross-product ratio is the standard formula for the odds ratio in a case-control study.\n\nSubstituting the cell counts into the formula:\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{40 \\times 120}{30 \\times 60} = \\frac{4800}{1800} = \\frac{48}{18} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nTo provide the final numeric answer, we convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.666... $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures as requested, we get $2.67$.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe computed odds ratio is approximately $2.67$. This means that the odds of having diabetes mellitus (the exposure) are $2.67$ times higher for individuals with granuloma annulare (cases) than for individuals without granuloma annulare (controls). An odds ratio greater than $1$ suggests a positive association between the exposure and the disease. In the context of this study, it indicates that diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased odds of having granuloma annulare. It is important to note that in a case-control study, the odds ratio serves as an estimate of the relative risk, but it does not measure the incidence or risk of developing the disease directly.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.67}\n$$", "id": "4444221"}, {"introduction": "While the clinical appearance of GA can be distinctive, a definitive diagnosis relies on histopathology to confirm the nature of the inflammation and rule out mimics.

Developing this skill is fundamental for correlating microscopic findings with the clinical picture and establishing a diagnosis with confidence.", "problem": "A $52$-year-old woman presents with several slowly enlarging, asymptomatic annular plaques on the dorsal hands and forearms. A punch biopsy from the edge of a plaque shows the following features on routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining: a predominantly interstitial infiltrate in the upper to mid dermis composed of histiocytes that stream between intact collagen bundles; no well-formed necrobiotic foci; increased basophilic dermal mucin separating collagen bundles; a sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with rare eosinophils; and an intact epidermis without ulceration or perforation.

There is no deep extension into the subcutis on the sampled tissue.\n\nUsing core definitions of granulomatous inflammation (aggregates of activated macrophages [histiocytes] responding to persistent stimuli) and well-established histopathologic patterns of granuloma annulare (GA), determine which GA variant most likely accounts for this biopsy pattern.

Subcutaneous (deep) granuloma annulare", "solution": "The fundamental base for analysis is the definition of granulomatous inflammation as a tissue reaction characterized by accumulations of activated macrophages (histiocytes), often with accompanying lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells, organized in patterns determined by the nature and location of the inciting process. In the skin, widely accepted histopathologic patterns of granuloma annulare (GA) include palisading (necrobiotic) granulomas, interstitial histiocytic infiltrates with mucin, perforating lesions showing transepidermal elimination, and deep/subcutaneous foci of necrobiosis.\n\nWe apply the following principle-based distinctions:\n\n- In palisading (necrobiotic) GA, histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells arrange in a palisade around well-defined foci of degenerated (necrobiotic) collagen, typically with variable dermal mucin but conspicuous “central” zones of alteration; the architecture suggests focal “cores” of necrobiosis encircled by histiocytes.\n\n- In interstitial-type GA, histiocytes are distributed between collagen bundles without forming discrete palisades; dermal mucin is characteristically increased, and the collagen bundles remain generally intact but separated by mucin and histiocytes, producing a “streaming” interstitial pattern. Eosinophils may be present but are not a defining feature and are typically sparse.\n\n- In perforating GA, the hallmark is transepidermal elimination of altered collagen and mucin, often accompanied by an overlying epidermal defect, crust, or channel through which degenerated material is extruded.\n\n- In subcutaneous (deep) GA, granulomatous inflammation and necrobiosis are predominantly localized in the subcutaneous fat (panniculus), often clinically manifesting as deep nodules, with histology showing involvement below the dermis.\n\nWe now parse the biopsy features against these patterns. The biopsy shows a predominantly interstitial histiocytic pattern, intact collagen bundles separated by increased dermal mucin confirmed by Alcian blue at pH $2.5$, sparse perivascular lymphocytes and rare eosinophils, and no discrete central necrobiotic foci. The epidermis is intact and there is no perforation. There is no extension into subcutis. The presence of abundant dermal mucin is a key discriminator favoring GA over several interstitial granulomatous mimics, and the absence of palisading necrobiosis, perforation, and subcutaneous involvement aligns with the interstitial variant.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Interstitial-type granuloma annulare — The defining features are interstitial histiocytes between collagen bundles, abundant dermal mucin separating collagen, and lack of well-formed palisaded necrobiotic foci. The intact epidermis and confinement to the dermis also fit. Rare eosinophils can be present in GA and do not contradict the pattern. This precisely matches the described biopsy. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Palisading (necrobiotic) granuloma annulare — This would require conspicuous foci of necrobiotic collagen encircled by palisading histiocytes. The vignette explicitly notes no well-formed necrobiotic foci and emphasizes a streaming interstitial pattern. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Perforating granuloma annulare — This requires transepidermal elimination with an epidermal channel or defect and elimination of altered collagen and mucin through the epidermis. The epidermis here is intact with no perforation. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Subcutaneous (deep) granuloma annulare — This pattern localizes primarily in subcutis, often presenting as deep nodules, with granulomatous inflammation below the dermis. The biopsy specifies involvement limited to upper to mid dermis without deep extension. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely variant, justified by the organizing principles of granulomatous inflammation and established histopathologic patterns, is the interstitial-type granuloma annulare.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4444208"}, {"introduction": "For patients with generalized or recalcitrant GA, systemic therapies such as cyclosporine can be effective, but their use requires vigilant monitoring for potentially serious adverse effects.

Granuloma annulare is a valid dermatologic condition for which cyclosporine is a recognized, though off-label, systemic therapy. The two major adverse effects presented, hypertension and nephrotoxicity, are well-documented, dose-dependent side effects of cyclosporine.

It provides sufficient, specific clinical data to allow for a reasoned decision based on established pharmacological principles and clinical guidelines for managing cyclosporine therapy. A single best management strategy among the options can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a realistic clinical scenario that is internally consistent and grounded in established medical science. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Management Plan\n\nThe patient exhibits two significant, well-known adverse effects of cyclosporine: nephrotoxicity and hypertension. The management must address both issues promptly and according to established guidelines.\n\n1.  **Management of Nephrotoxicity**: A greater than $30\\%$ increase in serum creatinine from baseline is a clear indication for cyclosporine dose reduction. The standard recommendation is to reduce the dose by $20-25\\%$. In this case, the baseline creatinine is $0.9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ and the current value is $1.2\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, a $33.3\\%$ increase. A dose reduction is mandatory.\n\n2.  **Management of Hypertension**: The new BP of $150/95\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ requires antihypertensive therapy. Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine) are the agents of choice for cyclosporine-induced hypertension. They not only lower systemic blood pressure but may also counteract cyclosporine-induced afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction in the glomerulus, potentially ameliorating the nephrotoxic effect. Other agents like ACE inhibitors can be used but are often second-line in this specific context due to potential for acute GFR reduction. Non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers like diltiazem and verapamil are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 $3\\mathrm{A}4$ (CYP3A4) and would increase cyclosporine concentrations, which is generally undesirable when managing toxicity.\n\n3.  **Management of Concomitant Medications**: NSAIDs can exacerbate cyclosporine nephrotoxicity and should be discontinued. A thorough review of all medications for potential CYP3A4 interactions is also a critical part of management.\n\n4.  **Monitoring**: Following any intervention (dose reduction, initiation of antihypertensive), close monitoring is essential. Repeating blood pressure measurements and laboratory tests (serum creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes such as potassium) within $1-2$ weeks is appropriate to assess the response and ensure safety.\n\n5.  **Contingency Planning**: If these measures fail to control the hypertension and normalize renal function, a further dose reduction or complete discontinuation of cyclosporine may be necessary. Therapeutic drug monitoring (checking a trough cyclosporine level) can be a useful adjunct to guide dosing.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A) Reduce cyclosporine dose by approximately $25\\%$ (for example, from $3.5$ to $2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$), start a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker such as amlodipine, repeat BP and laboratory tests (serum creatinine, electrolytes, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) in $1$ week, review for cytochrome P450 $3\\mathrm{A}4$ (CYP3A4) drug interactions and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and consider checking a cyclosporine trough level if available; taper off cyclosporine and transition to an alternative if abnormalities persist or worsen.**\nThis option comprehensively addresses all aspects of the clinical problem according to best practices. It recommends an appropriate dose reduction ($\\approx 25-30\\%$), initiation of the preferred antihypertensive (dihydropyridine CCB), cessation of a contributing medication (NSAIDs), a close monitoring interval ($1$ week), and prudent additional steps (review of drug interactions, TDM consideration, and a contingency plan).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B) Continue the current cyclosporine dose and add an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor; recheck BP and laboratory tests in $4$ weeks because a $0.3\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ creatinine change is expected variation.**\nThis option is flawed on multiple grounds. Continuing the current dose ignores the significant ($33.3\\%$) rise in creatinine, which is not \"expected variation.\" An ACE inhibitor is not the first-line antihypertensive in this setting. A monitoring interval of $4$ weeks is dangerously long given the acute changes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C) Increase cyclosporine to $5\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ for better granuloma annulare control, initiate diltiazem for BP, and recheck laboratory tests monthly.**\nThis plan is dangerous. Increasing the cyclosporine dose in the presence of clear toxicity (nephrotoxicity and hypertension) is contraindicated and would likely worsen the patient's condition significantly. Diltiazem is a CYP3A4 inhibitor that would further increase cyclosporine levels, compounding the toxicity. Monthly monitoring is insufficient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D) Stop cyclosporine immediately and switch to adalimumab; omit further renal monitoring because the creatinine rise is less than $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.**\nStopping the drug is a definitive option, but dose reduction is typically the first step. The more significant error is the rationale to \"omit further renal monitoring.\" The relative increase in creatinine ($33.3\\%$) is far more important than the absolute increase ($0.3\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$), and renal function must always be monitored to ensure recovery after stopping a nephrotoxic agent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E) Reduce cyclosporine dose by $10\\%$, delay antihypertensive therapy unless BP exceeds $160/100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, and monitor BP and serum creatinine every $3$ weeks.**\nThis plan constitutes undertreatment. A $10\\%$ dose reduction is likely insufficient for a $33.3\\%$ creatinine rise. A BP of $150/95\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ requires treatment; delaying until it reaches $160/100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is inappropriate. A monitoring interval of $3$ weeks is too long for an acute problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4444218"}]}
