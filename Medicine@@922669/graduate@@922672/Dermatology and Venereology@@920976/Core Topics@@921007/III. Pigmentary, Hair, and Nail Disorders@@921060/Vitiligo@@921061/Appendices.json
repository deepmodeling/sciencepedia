The Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) is a widely used tool that standardizes this assessment by combining the affected area with the degree of depigmentation. This exercise provides practical experience in applying the VASI formula to a hypothetical patient, reinforcing the skills needed to quantify disease burden and monitor changes over time [@problem_id:4499999].", "problem": "A clinician is quantifying vitiligo burden using the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI), which is based on the following foundational facts: a \"hand unit\" corresponds to the palmar surface of the patient’s hand including the volar surface of the digits and approximates $1$ percent of the total body surface area; the degree of depigmentation of a lesion is represented as a fraction $D$ in $[0,1]$; and the VASI for any region is the sum, over all lesions in that region, of the product of hand units involved and the fractional depigmentation. For disjoint regions, the overall VASI is the sum of the regional VASI values. In this problem, the \"facial region\" for the facial VASI (F-VASI) is defined as the head and neck combined, consistent with the Rule of Nines, which together constitute approximately $9$ hand units, ensuring that an involvement of up to $9$ hand units on the face is physically plausible.\n\nA patient with non-segmental vitiligo has the following involvement:\n- Facial region: involvement totaling $5$ hand units with uniform depigmentation fraction $0.5$.\n- Trunk region: involvement totaling $10$ hand units with uniform depigmentation fraction $0.25$.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions above, compute:\n- the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index ($F\\text{-}VASI$) for the facial region, and\n- the overall VASI restricted to the facial and trunk regions combined.\n\nExpress both results as exact values with no units.

For a region with total involved area $A$ and a uniform fractional depigmentation $D$, this calculation simplifies to the direct product of these two quantities.\nLet $VASI_R$ denote the score for a region $R$. If the area of involvement is $A_R$ and the uniform depigmentation is $D_R$, the score is given by:\n$$VASI_R = A_R \\times D_R$$\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the facial VASI ($F\\text{-}VASI$) and the overall VASI for the facial and trunk regions combined.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $F\\text{-}VASI$.\nThe problem states that the facial region has an involvement totaling $A_F = 5$ hand units with a uniform depigmentation fraction of $D_F = 0.5$.\nUsing the formula, the $F\\text{-}VASI$ is:\n$$F\\text{-}VASI = A_F \\times D_F = 5 \\times 0.5 = 2.5$$\nThe given information that the entire head and neck region constitutes approximately $9$ hand units serves to establish the plausibility of the stated involvement of $5$ hand units, as $5 < 9$. This value is not otherwise used in the calculation of the score for the affected area.\n\nSecond, we calculate the overall VASI for the combination of the facial and trunk regions. The problem states that for disjoint regions, the overall VASI is the sum of the individual regional VASI values. The facial and trunk regions are anatomically disjoint.\nLet $VASI_{overall}$ be the combined score.\n$$VASI_{overall} = VASI_{facial} + VASI_{trunk}$$\nWe have already calculated $VASI_{facial} = F\\text{-}VASI = 2.5$.\nNext, we must calculate the VASI for the trunk region, $VASI_{trunk}$.
