Dermatophytes are keratinophilic fungi that invade the stratum corneum and hair shaft (endothrix or ectothrix), leading to broken hairs and scale.\n    2.  Potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount reveals hyphae in cases of dermatophytosis.\n    3.  Certain ectothrix fungal species fluoresce under a Wood’s lamp.\n    4.  Histopathology of alopecia areata (AA) is characterized by a peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate around anagen follicles.\n    5.  Typical presentation of AA includes smooth, non-scaly patches, exclamation mark hairs, preserved follicular ostia, and potential nail pitting.\n- **Vignette Details**:\n    - Patient: A child, age $9$ years.\n    - History: $4$ weeks of developing alopecia patches.\n    - Lesions: Circular patches of alopecia, $2$ to $3$ cm in diameter, on the parietal scalp.\n    - Clinical Signs: Mild scale, absence of scarring, mild posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.\n    - Systemic Health: No reported systemic symptoms.\n- **Task**: Identify all options that correctly pair a key clinical discriminator, a targeted diagnostic test, and the expected result for distinguishing between AA and TC.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is a standard clinical reasoning exercise in dermatology.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The descriptions of alopecia areata (an autoimmune condition) and tinea capitis (a fungal infection), their clinical manifestations, and the associated diagnostic procedures (KOH mount, Wood's lamp, biopsy, culture) are all consistent with established medical science and clinical practice in dermatology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides a clinical scenario, the relevant differential diagnoses, and the foundational principles needed to evaluate the options. The task is to assess the correctness of given pairings of clinical signs and diagnostic results. A unique set of correct answers can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The language used is precise medical terminology, free from subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-constructed, scientifically sound question that tests clinical reasoning in dermatology. The solution will proceed by analyzing each option based on the provided principles and the clinical vignette.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Evaluation\nThe clinical vignette presents a $9$-year-old child with patchy alopecia, scale, and cervical lymphadenopathy. This constellation of findings is highly suggestive of tinea capitis. Alopecia areata is the primary non-scarring alopecia in the differential diagnosis, but it typically presents as smooth (non-scaly) patches and is not associated with regional lymphadenopathy. The task is to evaluate statements that serve to distinguish between these two conditions.\n\n**Option A: Smooth, non-scaling alopecic patches with exclamation mark hairs at the periphery; scalp punch biopsy shows a peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate (“swarm of bees”) around anagen follicles.**\n-   **Clinical Discriminator**: Smooth, non-scaling patches and exclamation mark hairs (short, broken hairs tapered at the base) are pathognomonic clinical signs of alopecia areata. This presentation contrasts sharply with the typical scaly patches of tinea capitis.\n-   **Diagnostic Test and Result**: A scalp punch biopsy is a definitive diagnostic tool. The finding of a dense, peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate (\"swarm of bees\") around the bulbs of anagen hair follicles is the classic, diagnostic histopathological feature of alopecia areata.\n-   **Evaluation**: This option correctly pairs the classic clinical signs of alopecia areata with its definitive histopathological confirmation. This represents a valid and specific method for diagnosing AA and distinguishing it from TC.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B: Patchy alopecia with scale and “black dot” broken hairs; $10\\%$ potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount of epilated hairs reveals endothrix hyphae and arthroconidia consistent with Trichophyton infection.**\n-   **Clinical Discriminator**: The presence of scale and \"black dots\" (hairs broken flush with the scalp surface) is a classic presentation of tinea capitis, particularly the endothrix type caused by species like *Trichophyton tonsurans*. This presentation is consistent with the vignette's mention of scale.\n-   **Diagnostic Test and Result**: A $10\\%$ KOH wet mount is a rapid and standard test for dermatophytosis. Visualizing fungal elements—in this case, hyphae and arthroconidia *inside* the hair shaft (endothrix)—provides direct, microscopic confirmation of tinea capitis.\n-   **Evaluation**: This option correctly pairs a highly specific clinical presentation of tinea capitis with the standard, rapid, and confirmatory diagnostic test.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option C: Well-circumscribed patches with minimal scale and nail pitting; Wood’s lamp examination shows no fluorescence, thereby confirming alopecia areata and excluding tinea capitis.**\n-   **Clinical Discriminator**: Well-circumscribed patches and nail pitting are features of alopecia areata.\n-   **Diagnostic Test and Result**: A Wood's lamp causes certain dermatophyte species (e.g., *Microsporum spp.*) to fluoresce. However, the most common causative agent of tinea capitis in many regions, *Trichophyton tonsurans*, is an endothrix fungus and does **not** fluoresce. Therefore, a negative Wood's lamp examination has poor negative predictive value and **cannot** exclude tinea capitis.\n-   **Evaluation**: The conclusion that a negative Wood's lamp test confirms AA and excludes tinea capitis is a logical flaw.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D: Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy accompanying scaly patches; dermoscopy shows comma hairs and corkscrew hairs; this pattern together with negative fungal culture confirms alopecia areata.**\n-   **Clinical Discriminator**: Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, scaly patches, and dermoscopic findings of comma hairs and corkscrew hairs are all characteristic signs of tinea capitis, not alopecia areata.\n-   **Diagnostic Test and Result**: The option states that these signs of tinea capitis, when paired with a negative fungal culture, would confirm alopecia areata. This is illogical and diagnostically reversed. Fungal cultures can yield false-negative results. The strong positive clinical and dermoscopic evidence for tinea capitis would far outweigh a single negative culture result.\n-   **Evaluation**: The reasoning presented is contradictory. It uses signs of tinea capitis to confirm alopecia areata.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E: Boggy, tender inflammatory plaque (kerion) with pustules; bacterial culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus confirms tinea capitis.**\n-   **Clinical Discriminator**: A kerion is a severe inflammatory response to a fungal infection (tinea capitis).\n-   **Diagnostic Test and Result**: Kerions are frequently superinfected with bacteria, often *Staphylococcus aureus*. A bacterial culture would confirm this secondary infection. However, the primary pathogen is the fungus. Confirming the secondary bacterial infection does not confirm the primary diagnosis of tinea capitis. The definitive diagnosis of tinea capitis requires identification of the fungus itself via KOH, fungal culture, or other methods.\n-   **Evaluation**: The option incorrectly identifies the confirmatory test. A positive bacterial culture confirms a secondary infection, not the underlying tinea capitis.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option F: Broken hairs at the scalp surface with thick adherent scale; periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain on hair shaft or scalp biopsy shows fungal elements within the hair shaft.**\n-   **Clinical Discriminator**: Broken hairs and significant scaling are cardinal features of tinea capitis.\n-   **Diagnostic Test and Result**: A periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain is a histochemical technique used in pathology to highlight carbohydrates, including the chitin in fungal cell walls, which stain bright magenta. Performing a PAS stain on a scalp biopsy or on plucked hairs is a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting fungi. The presence of fungal elements within the hair shaft is definitive for tinea capitis.\n-   **Evaluation**: This option correctly pairs a classic clinical appearance of tinea capitis with a definitive histopathological method of confirmation. It is a valid alternative to KOH or culture.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option G: Smooth alopecic patch with preserved follicular openings and a positive perilesional hair-pull test yielding dystrophic anagen hairs; direct microscopy of plucked hairs in KOH shows no hyphae.**\n-   **Clinical Discriminator**: A smooth patch with preserved follicular openings is classic for alopecia areata. A positive hair-pull test at the periphery signifies active disease. Pulling dystrophic anagen hairs indicates a severe, acute process. These are strong indicators for AA.\n-   **Diagnostic Test and Result**: Performing a KOH preparation is a targeted test to rule out tinea capitis. A negative result (no hyphae) in the context of strong clinical signs for AA serves to exclude the main differential diagnosis, thereby increasing the certainty of the AA diagnosis.\n-   **Evaluation**: This option correctly pairs a set of clinical findings highly suggestive of active alopecia areata with a negative result on a key test for its main mimic. This combination represents a valid and crucial step in the diagnostic pathway to distinguish the two conditions.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABFG}$$", "id": "4410845"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of alopecia areata is established, objectively quantifying the extent of hair loss is the next critical step for treatment planning and monitoring efficacy.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) burden, denoted as $S$, is defined as the area-weighted average of the hair loss fractions across the four specified scalp regions. Let the $i$-th region have a relative surface area weight $w_i$ and a hair loss fraction $h_i$. The general formula for the weighted average is:\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i h_i $$\nwhere $N$ is the number of regions, which is $4$ in this case. The regions are Vertex (V), Right Profile (RP), Left Profile (LP), and Occiput (O). The specific formula for the SALT score is:\n$$ S = w_V h_V + w_{RP} h_{RP} + w_{LP} h_{LP} + w_O h_O $$\nThe given values are:\n- Weights: $w_V = 0.40$, $w_{RP} = 0.18$, $w_{LP} = 0.18$, $w_O = 0.24$.\n- Hair loss fractions: $h_V = 0.50$, $h_{RP} = 0.20$, $h_{LP} = 0.10$, $h_O = 0.30$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ S = (0.40)(0.50) + (0.18)(0.20) + (0.18)(0.10) + (0.24)(0.30) $$\nWe calculate each term individually:\n- Contribution from Vertex: $0.40 \\times 0.50 = 0.200$\n- Contribution from Right Profile: $0.18 \\times 0.20 = 0.036$\n- Contribution from Left Profile: $0.18 \\times 0.10 = 0.018$\n- Contribution from Occiput: $0.24 \\times 0.30 = 0.072$\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total SALT burden $S$:\n$$ S = 0.200 + 0.036 + 0.018 + 0.072 = 0.326 $$\nThe first task is to compute $S$. The result is $S = 0.326$.\n\nThe second task is to interpret the severity class. The calculated value $S = 0.326$ falls within the range $0.25 \\leq S \\leq 0.49$.
