The genes $BRAF$, $NRAS$, and $TERT$ are well-established drivers and markers in the pathogenesis of melanocytic neoplasms. The link between their mutational status and specific nevus subtypes is a core concept in modern dermatopathology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The question asks for the \"most likely\" diagnosis given a specific, internally consistent set of data. This is a standard problem of differential diagnosis based on clinicopathological and molecular correlation. A unique and well-reasoned answer can be derived from the established scientific literature. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objectivity:** The descriptive terms (\"symmetric architecture\", \"maturation with descent\") and molecular results ($BRAF^{V600E}$ positivity, wild-type $NRAS$, wild-type $TERT$ promoter) are objective, standard, and clearly defined findings in the field. The problem is objective.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness:** The findings are mutually consistent. A histologically benign nevus with a $BRAF$ mutation is a classic presentation. The presence of wild-type $NRAS$ is expected, as $BRAF$ and $NRAS$ mutations are typically mutually exclusive in nevi. The wild-type $TERT$ promoter finding is consistent with a benign lesion, as $TERT$ promoter mutations are a common secondary event in the progression to melanoma. The information is sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe fundamental principle is to correlate the given molecular signature with the known genetic drivers of different melanocytic nevus subtypes. Melanocytic proliferations are primarily driven by activating mutations in the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Signature:**\n    -   **$BRAF^{V600E}$ Mutation:** This is an activating mutation in the $BRAF$ gene, a key component of the MAPK pathway. This specific mutation is the most common genetic event in melanocytic nevi. It characteristically triggers an initial burst of proliferation that is subsequently arrested by oncogene-induced senescence, leading to a stable, benign nevus.\n    -   **Wild-Type $NRAS$:** The $NRAS$ gene is another component of the MAPK pathway, upstream of $BRAF$. Activating mutations in $NRAS$ and $BRAF$ are the two most common initiating events in nevi, but they are almost always mutually exclusive. The finding of wild-type $NRAS$ is therefore expected in a $BRAF$-mutated lesion.\n    -   **Wild-Type $TERT$ Promoter:** Mutations in the promoter of the $TERT$ gene, which lead to enhanced telomerase expression and cellular immortalization, are a key step in the progression from nevus to melanoma. The absence of a $TERT$ promoter mutation strongly supports the benign nature of the lesion, consistent with the histology.\n\n2.  **Correlate with Nevus Subtypes:**\n    The challenge is to identify which nevus subtype is defined by a $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation.\n\n    -   **Common Acquired Melanocytic Nevi:** These are the most prevalent moles in the human population. Approximately $80\\%$ of these nevi are driven by an activating $BRAF$ mutation, predominantly $BRAF^{V600E}$. The presented findings—benign symmetrical architecture, maturation, $BRAF^{V600E}$ positivity, and wild-type $NRAS$ and $TERT$ promoter—are the quintessential features of a common acquired melanocytic nevus.\n\n    -   **Congenital Melanocytic Nevi:** While small congenital nevi can have $BRAF$ mutations, medium and large congenital nevi are classically associated with activating mutations in $NRAS$. The given wild-type $NRAS$ status makes this diagnosis less likely.\n\n    -   **Spitz Nevi:** Classic Spitz nevi are genetically distinct. They are characterized by the absence of $BRAF$ and $NRAS$ mutations. Instead, they are typically driven by various kinase gene fusions involving $ALK$, $ROS1$, $NTRK1$, $NTRK3$, $MET$, or $RET$. The presence of a $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation effectively excludes a diagnosis of classic Spitz nevus.\n\n    -   **Blue Nevi:** Blue nevi and their variants (including cellular blue nevus) are defined by activating mutations in the G-protein alpha subunits $GNAQ$ or $GNA11$. These lesions are characteristically negative for $BRAF$ and $NRAS$ mutations.\n\n    -   **Deep Penetrating Nevi:** These are now considered part of the blue nevus spectrum molecularly. They often show mutations in $GNAQ$ or $GNA11$, frequently accompanied by mutations in $CTNNB1$ (beta-catenin). They are not associated with $BRAF$ mutations.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of benign, symmetric histology with maturation, a $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation, and wild-type $NRAS$ is the specific and classic profile of a common acquired melanocytic nevus.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Common acquired melanocytic nevus (junctional or compound)**\nThis nevus subtype is most frequently characterized by an activating $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation (found in up to $80\\%$ of cases) which drives the initial proliferation before senescence arrests growth. The benign histology described (symmetry, maturation) is classic for this lesion. The genetic profile provided is a textbook match.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Medium congenital melanocytic nevus**\nThis nevus subtype is most commonly associated with activating mutations in $NRAS$, not $BRAF$. The problem statement specifies wild-type $NRAS$, making this option highly unlikely.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Spitz nevus (classic)**\nClassic Spitz nevi are defined molecularly by specific kinase fusions and the characteristic absence of $BRAF$ and $NRAS$ mutations. The identified $BRAF^{V600E}$ mutation is exclusionary for this diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Blue nevus (common)**\nThis nevus subtype is driven by mutations in $GNAQ$ or $GNA11$. It is, by definition, negative for $BRAF$ and $NRAS$ mutations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Deep penetrating nevus**\nThis nevus is part of the blue nevus family, sharing a molecular pathogenesis involving $GNAQ$ or $GNA11$ mutations. It does not harbor $BRAF$ mutations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4420453"}, {"introduction": "One of the most frequent and high-stakes challenges in dermatopathology is the distinction between a benign melanocytic nevus and an early melanoma. This problem simulates a common scenario where a lesion displays ambiguous features, such as limited pagetoid scatter of melanocytes. This practice will hone your ability to systematically evaluate and synthesize a constellation of clues—including architectural disorder, cytologic atypia, and the results of ancillary immunohistochemical stains like PRAME and p16—to arrive at a defensible diagnosis in a diagnostically challenging \"gray zone\" case.", "problem": "A dermatopathology service receives a shave excision from the mid-back of a $34$-year-old patient. On hematoxylin and eosin sections, there is a predominantly junctional and focally compound melanocytic proliferation with nests and single melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. The lesion appears to show limited pagetoid scatter: a small number of solitary melanocytes are present above the basal layer in a central zone directly overlying several junctional nests, without obvious involvement of adnexal ostia. The clinician asks whether this lesion should be classified as early melanoma (melanoma in situ or microinvasive melanoma) rather than a benign nevus with focal upward migration.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases to reason toward a classification: in melanocytic proliferations, architectural disorder (asymmetry, poor circumscription, confluent lentiginous growth), cytologic atypia (nuclear enlargement, irregular nuclear contours, prominent nucleoli), maturation with descent (progressive reduction in nest size and cell size with depth in the dermis), proliferation pattern (presence and location of mitotic figures), and the distribution of pagetoid scatter (focal over nests versus irregular, widespread, or adnexal-involving) are key determinants. Ancillary immunohistochemistry can contribute: diffuse nuclear staining for Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) supports melanoma, whereas retained expression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor $2\\text{A}$ (p16) and a low dermal Ki-$67$ labeling index favor benign nevus.\n\nWhich set of additional histopathologic and ancillary criteria, if present in this lesion with otherwise limited pagetoid scatter, would allow classification as early melanoma rather than a benign nevus with focal upward migration?\n\nA.

I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a detailed solution.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Patient and Specimen**: A shave excision from the mid-back of a $34$-year-old patient.\n*   **Initial Histologic Findings**:\n    *   A predominantly junctional and focally compound melanocytic proliferation.\n    *   Presence of nests and single melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction.\n    *   Limited pagetoid scatter described as a small number of solitary melanocytes above the basal layer, confined to a central zone directly overlying several junctional nests.\n    *   No involvement of adnexal ostia by the pagetoid scatter.\n*   **Diagnostic Dilemma**: Differentiating between early melanoma (melanoma in situ or microinvasive melanoma) and a benign nevus with focal upward migration.\n*   **Fundamental Diagnostic Principles**:\n    *   **Architecture**: asymmetry, poor circumscription, confluent lentiginous growth.\n    *   **Cytology**: atypia (nuclear enlargement, irregular contours, prominent nucleoli).\n    *   **Maturation**: maturation with descent in the dermis.\n    *   **Proliferation**: presence and location of mitotic figures.\n    *   **Pagetoid Scatter Pattern**: focal over nests vs. irregular, widespread, or adnexal-involving.\n*   **Ancillary Diagnostic Principles**:\n    *   **PRAME**: Diffuse nuclear staining for Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) supports melanoma.\n    *   **p16**: Retained expression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor $2\\text{A}$ (p$16$) favors a benign nevus.\n    *   **Ki-67**: A low dermal Ki-$67$ labeling index favors a benign nevus.\n*   **Question**: Which set of additional histopathologic and ancillary criteria would allow classification as early melanoma?\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. It presents a classic and common diagnostic challenge in dermatopathology. The described lesion with limited, central pagetoid scatter is a well-known borderline entity. The principles listed for differential diagnosis—architectural features, cytologic atypia, maturation, mitotic activity, pattern of pagetoidism, and the use of ancillary markers like PRAME, p$16$, and Ki-$67$—are all standard-of-care factors used by pathologists to distinguish benign nevi from melanoma. The information is factually correct and based on established principles of pathology.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It establishes a baseline scenario (a lesion with an ambiguous feature) and asks for a list of additional findings that would resolve the ambiguity in favor of a specific diagnosis (melanoma). This structure allows for a unique and meaningful solution based on the provided diagnostic framework.\n*   **Objective**: The problem is stated objectively, using precise and standardized medical terminology (e.g., \"pagetoid scatter,\" \"confluent lentiginous growth,\" \"maturation with descent\"). There is no subjective or opinion-based language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound, and objective question within its specified domain. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to identify the set of features that, when superimposed on the initial finding of a melanocytic lesion with limited central pagetoid scatter, would provide sufficient evidence to diagnose early melanoma. The provided fundamental principles state that melanoma is characterized by architectural disorder, significant cytologic atypia, lack of maturation, abnormal proliferation, and a malignant pattern of pagetoid scatter. Ancillary studies should align with these findings.\n\nLet's dissect the criteria for melanoma based on the principles provided:\n1.  **Architecture**: Must be disordered (asymmetric, poorly circumscribed, confluent lentiginous growth).\n2.  **Cytology**: Must show significant atypia.\n3.  **Maturation**: Must be absent (dermal cells are as atypical as junctional cells).\n4.  **Proliferation**: Mitoses, especially deep or atypical, and a high Ki-$67$ index are expected.\n5.  **Pagetoid Scatter**: Must be widespread and irregular, not confined centrally over nests.\n6.  **Ancillary IHC**: PRAME should be diffusely positive, and p$16$ expression should be lost or significantly reduced.\n\nThe correct option will be the one that combines these features to paint a convincing picture of malignancy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Overall symmetry and sharp lateral circumscription; junctional nests with focal bridging; pagetoid melanocytes restricted to the centers of nests; evident maturation with descent in the dermal component; absence of dermal mitoses; Ki-$67$ labeling index in dermal melanocytes $3\\%$; retained p$16$ expression; PRAME negative or only focal nuclear staining in $10\\%$ of lesional cells.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option describes features overwhelmingly characteristic of a benign nevus, possibly with dysplastic features (\"focal bridging\"). Symmetry, sharp circumscription, maturation with descent, absence of dermal mitoses, a low Ki-$67$ index, retained p$16$, and negative/focal PRAME are all strong indicators of a benign process. The pagetoid scatter pattern is described as the benign type. This set of findings would lead to a diagnosis of a benign nevus, not melanoma.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Architectural asymmetry with poor lateral circumscription; confluent lentiginous proliferation extending beyond the lateral edges of nests; irregular, non-nest-centered pagetoid scatter involving multiple epidermal levels and extending to adnexal ostia; marked cytologic atypia at the junction; absence of maturation with descent; presence of dermal mitoses ($0$ per $\\text{mm}^2$) near the junctional component; elevated Ki-$67$ labeling index in junctional and dermal melanocytes ($10\\%$); diffuse strong nuclear PRAME positivity in the majority of lesional cells; decreased to lost p$16$ expression.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option presents a complete \"checklist\" for melanoma. It includes major criteria such as architectural disorder (asymmetry, poor circumscription, confluent lentiginous growth), significant cytologic atypia, lack of maturation, and presence of dermal mitoses. It also describes the malignant pattern of pagetoid scatter (widespread, irregular, adnexal-involving). The ancillary studies fully support malignancy: elevated Ki-$67$, diffuse PRAME positivity, and loss of p$16$. This constellation of findings is diagnostic of melanoma.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Symmetric silhouette with crisp borders; predominantly nested junctional growth with rare single melanocytes extending $1$ rete ridge beyond nests; mild cytologic atypia; single superficial dermal mitotic figure adjacent to an area of inflammation; Ki-$67$ labeling index in dermal melanocytes $5\\%$; equivocal PRAME staining in approximately $15\\%$ of nuclei; retained p$16$ expression.**\n*   **Analysis**: This describes a lesion with mixed features, creating a diagnostic gray zone. The architecture (\"Symmetric silhouette with crisp borders\"), mild atypia, and retained p$16$ favor a benign diagnosis (likely a dysplastic nevus). The single dermal mitosis is a major red flag for melanoma, but its significance can be debated in the presence of inflammation and other benign features. The Ki-$67$ is low-to-intermediate, and the PRAME result is equivocal. While concerning, this set of findings is not sufficient for a definitive classification of melanoma and would likely be diagnosed as a \"melanocytic proliferation with severe atypia\" or a similar indeterminate category, warranting complete excision but falling short of a firm melanoma diagnosis.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Limited central pagetoid scatter above junctional nests; absence of dermal component; clinical lesion diameter $6$ $\\text{mm}$ and variegated color by history; MART-1 (Melanoma Antigen Recognized by T cells 1) diffusely positive and S100 protein positive; no dermal mitoses identifiable; Ki-$67$ labeling index overall $5\\%$.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option is largely unhelpful. The clinical features ($6$ $\\text{mm}$ diameter, variegation) are suggestive but are not histologic criteria. MART-1 and S100 are lineage markers, meaning they stain both benign nevi and melanomas; their positivity is expected and non-discriminatory. The absence of a dermal component means we are only considering a junctional process (melanoma in situ vs. junctional nevus). The key histologic findings provided—limited central pagetoid scatter and a low Ki-$67$ index—actually argue *against* melanoma. This set of criteria is insufficient for diagnosis.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Pagetoid melanocytes confined to the stratum spinosum centrally; junctional nests show clefting and prominent eosinophilic globules; spindle and epithelioid melanocytes with maturation present in the dermis; no dermal mitoses; high-power fields show prominent Kamino bodies; Ki-$67$ labeling index $5\\%$ in dermal melanocytes; PRAME negative; p$16$ retained; lesion located on the lower extremity of a $12$-year-old patient.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option describes a textbook Spitz nevus. Key features include the cell morphology (spindle and epithelioid), maturation, clefting around junctional nests, and the pathognomonic finding of Kamino bodies (eosinophilic globules of basement membrane material). The anciallary profile (low Ki-$67$, negative PRAME, retained p$16$) and clinical context ($12$-year-old patient) are all classic for a Spitz nevus. A Spitz nevus is a benign entity, although some variants can be histologically challenging to distinguish from melanoma.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4420476"}, {"introduction": "While ancillary studies are invaluable in resolving difficult cases, their power lies in their proper interpretation.

The lesion measures $6$ mm clinically. On histopathological review, there is an asymmetric junctional proliferation with focal confluence and pagetoid scatter of melanocytes, nuclear pleomorphism, and bridging rete, but maturation with descent is difficult to assess due to tangential sectioning. The differential diagnosis is between a severely dysplastic compound nevus and an early superficial spreading melanoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) shows the following: Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) demonstrates diffuse, strong nuclear staining in $75\\%$ of lesional melanocytes; the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor $2\\text{A}$ (CDKN2A) product p$16$ shows complete loss in lesional melanocytes with intact staining in adjacent keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells; the Ki-$67$ index is approximately $10\\%$ at the dermoepidermal junction and $2\\%$ in the dermal component.

The immunophenotype alone is sufficient to render a definitive diagnosis of melanoma, even if histology is equivocal, because both diffuse PRAME and p$16$ loss have near-perfect specificity; ancillary testing would not change the diagnostic accuracy.\n\nB. The combination of diffuse nuclear PRAME positivity and tumor-restricted p$16$ loss substantially raises the post-test probability of melanoma relative to a severely dysplastic nevus, but integration with clinicopathologic features remains necessary; in borderline cases, chromosome $9\\text{p}21$ Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) or genome-wide copy number profiling can be pursued before finalizing the diagnosis.\n\nC. Diffuse PRAME staining is frequently observed in common acquired nevi, and p$16$ loss is typical in benign nevi due to oncogene-induced senescence; therefore, these findings argue against melanoma.\n\nD. Desmoplastic melanoma is the most likely diagnosis given strong PRAME staining, because desmoplastic melanoma almost always exhibits diffuse PRAME positivity together with p$16$ loss.\n\nE. Before calling p$16$ loss, one must confirm adequate internal positive controls; if controls are adequate, p$16$ loss supports melanoma but is not entirely specific, and should be interpreted in the context of morphology and other markers.\n\nF.

The described clinical presentation, histopathological features, and differential diagnosis represent a classic and common diagnostic challenge. The biomarkers PRAME, p16, and Ki-$67$ are extensively studied and routinely used in clinical practice for this purpose. The underlying biology of the $CDKN2A$ tumor suppressor gene and PRAME as a cancer-testis antigen is scientifically established. The scenario is entirely realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured. It provides a detailed, albeit ambiguous, case and asks for an evaluation of interpretative statements. The ambiguity of the histology is the central premise, justifying the need to lean on ancillary studies. A logical and definitive analysis of the options is possible based on the provided data and established scientific knowledge.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem uses precise, standard, and unbiased terminology from pathology and oncology. The data are presented quantitatively (e.g., '$6$ mm', '$75\\%$') and qualitatively (e.g., 'diffuse, strong', 'complete loss') as is customary in pathology reports.\n4.  **Completeness  Consistency**: The provided information is sufficient and internally consistent. The histological features are consistent with the differential diagnosis. The IHC findings, including the crucial detail about the internal positive control for p16, are described adequately to permit a reasoned interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound question reflecting a real-world diagnostic dilemma in pathology. A full analysis will be performed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe central task is to adjudicate between a severely dysplastic nevus and an early melanoma based on IHC findings, given that the morphology is equivocal. This requires an understanding of the biological roles and diagnostic utility of the markers.\n\n1.  **$p16$ (encoded by $CDKN2A$)**:\n    - **Biology**: $p16$ is a tumor suppressor protein that acts as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi). It inhibits CDK4/6, thereby keeping the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in its active, hypophosphorylated state. Active pRb prevents cells from progressing from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Loss of $p16$ function is a key event in bypassing cell cycle checkpoints, promoting uncontrolled proliferation, a hallmark of cancer.\n    - **Diagnostic Principle**: In benign nevi, the presence of an activating mutation (e.g., $BRAF^{V600E}$) triggers a protective mechanism called oncogene-induced senescence. This leads to a strong, uniform upregulation and expression of $p16$, which arrests proliferation and prevents malignant transformation. Therefore, benign and most dysplastic nevi show strong, diffuse $p16$ expression. In contrast, progression to melanoma often involves the biallelic inactivation of the $CDKN2A$ gene locus (on chromosome $9\\text{p}21$) through mutation, deletion, or epigenetic silencing. This results in the **complete loss of $p16$ protein expression**. The provided finding of \"complete loss in lesional melanocytes with intact staining in adjacent\" normal cells is technically valid (ruling out staining failure) and biologically significant. It is a powerful indicator of malignancy, as it signifies a breakdown of the senescence barrier.\n\n2.  **PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma)**:\n    - **Biology**: PRAME is a cancer-testis antigen, meaning its expression is typically restricted to immunologically privileged sites like the testis, but it becomes aberrantly re-expressed in various malignancies, including melanoma. It functions as a corepressor of retinoic acid receptor signaling, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and survival.\n    - **Diagnostic Principle**: While focal, weak PRAME expression can be seen in some benign nevi, **diffuse and strong nuclear staining in a high percentage ($75\\%$) of melanocytes** is highly sensitive and specific for melanoma. This pattern is rare in benign nevi.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of $p16$ and PRAME**:\n    The combination of complete $p16$ loss and diffuse/strong PRAME positivity is an immunophenotypic signature with very high specificity for melanoma. These two markers assess different but complementary pathways of melanomagenesis: $p16$ loss reflects the loss of a key tumor suppressor and cell cycle checkpoint, while PRAME overexpression reflects the activation of an oncogenic program. Together, they provide compelling evidence against a benign diagnosis.\n\n4.  **Ki-67**:\n    - **Biology**: Ki-$67$ is a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation.\n    - **Diagnostic Principle**: Melanomas generally have a higher Ki-$67$ proliferation index than nevi. An index of $10\\%$ at the junction is elevated and suspicious. The lower index ($2\\%$) in the dermal component is ambiguous; it could represent the maturation of a benign compound nevus, or it could simply reflect a very early, superficial melanoma with a minimal, less-proliferative invasive component. This finding does not resolve the ambiguity and is less dispositive than the $p16$ and PRAME results.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The immunophenotype alone is sufficient to render a definitive diagnosis of melanoma, even if histology is equivocal, because both diffuse PRAME and p$16$ loss have near-perfect specificity; ancillary testing would not change the diagnostic accuracy.**\nThis statement contains oversimplifications and absolute claims that are scientifically untenable. While the specificity of the combined PRAME+/$p16$-loss profile is very high, it is not \"near-perfect\" ($100\\%$). Diagnostic pathology is an integrative discipline; a diagnosis is a medical opinion based on the synthesis of all available data (clinical, morphological, and ancillary). Relying \"alone\" on IHC, especially in a legally and clinically significant diagnosis like melanoma, is contrary to best practices. The claim that \"ancillary testing would not change the diagnostic accuracy\" is false. More definitive molecular tests, like Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) to confirm $CDKN2A$ copy number loss or next-generation sequencing, provide a higher tier of evidence and can absolutely change or confirm a diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The combination of diffuse nuclear PRAME positivity and tumor-restricted p$16$ loss substantially raises the post-test probability of melanoma relative to a severely dysplastic nevus, but integration with clinicopathologic features remains necessary; in borderline cases, chromosome $9\\text{p}21$ Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) or genome-wide copy number profiling can be pursued before finalizing the diagnosis.**\nThis statement is a well-balanced and accurate reflection of modern diagnostic pathology. It correctly identifies that the IHC findings significantly increase the likelihood of melanoma (raise post-test probability). Critically, it upholds the foundational principle that these results must be integrated with the clinical and morphological context. It also correctly points out the appropriate next steps in a truly challenging borderline case: pursuing more definitive molecular tests like FISH for the $CDKN2A$ locus ($9\\text{p}21$) or broader genomic analysis. This approach is scientifically rigorous and aligns with best practice guidelines.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Diffuse PRAME staining is frequently observed in common acquired nevi, and p$16$ loss is typical in benign nevi due to oncogene-induced senescence; therefore, these findings argue against melanoma.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect on two fundamental points. First, diffuse and strong PRAME staining is a hallmark of melanoma and is *infrequent* in common nevi. Second, and more critically, oncogene-induced senescence in benign nevi results in $p16$ *overexpression*, not loss. $p16$ *loss* is a key event in the progression to melanoma. The statement reverses the established biology of both markers.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Desmoplastic melanoma is the most likely diagnosis given strong PRAME staining, because desmoplastic melanoma almost always exhibits diffuse PRAME positivity together with p$16$ loss.**\nThis statement makes an incorrect diagnostic leap. The diagnosis of desmoplastic melanoma is based on its characteristic morphology: a dermal-based, often paucicellular proliferation of spindle cells associated with a desmoplastic (sclerotic) stroma. The histopathology described in the problem—an asymmetric *junctional* proliferation with *pagetoid scatter*—is the classic presentation of *superficial spreading melanoma*, not desmoplastic melanoma. While IHC findings can support a diagnosis, they cannot override a completely discordant morphology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Before calling p$16$ loss, one must confirm adequate internal positive controls; if controls are adequate, p$16$ loss supports melanoma but is not entirely specific, and should be interpreted in the context of morphology and other markers.**\nThis statement articulates a critical principle of immunohistochemistry and diagnostic pathology. The interpretation of a \"negative\" or \"loss\" stain is only valid if one can prove the staining process worked. The presence of staining in non-neoplastic internal control cells (keratinocytes, endothelial cells, etc.) is essential for this, and the problem states this condition was met. The statement correctly points out that $p16$ loss is a supportive feature for melanoma, not a standalone diagnostic criterion, and must be interpreted in the overall context. This is a fundamentally sound and accurate statement about the proper use of this specific test.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. The pattern is most consistent with Spitz nevus, because most Spitz nevi demonstrate diffuse PRAME positivity and p$16$ loss; therefore, the melanoma diagnosis should be rejected.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Classic Spitz nevi are typically PRAME-negative and show retained (often strong) $p16$ expression. While some atypical Spitz tumors/melanomas with Spitzoid features can harbor $CDKN2A$ loss and other aberrations, the combination of diffuse PRAME positivity and $p16$ loss is not characteristic of benign Spitz nevi. Furthermore, a Spitz nevus is less likely in a $47$-year-old patient compared to the melanoma/dysplastic nevus spectrum. The described IHC profile strongly argues *against*, not for, a conventional Spitz nevus.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Summary of Correct Options\nOptions B and E both articulate scientifically sound and correct arguments.\n- Option E focuses on the necessary technical and interpretive principles for the p$16$ test itself.\n- Option B provides a broader, more comprehensive synthesis of all the data (PRAME, p$16$, clinicopathology) and outlines the complete diagnostic pathway.\nBoth are correct statements that apply to the scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BE}$$", "id": "4420454"}]}
