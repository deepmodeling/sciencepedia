This exercise [@problem_id:4422464] provides hands-on practice in applying standardized growth multipliers to calculate the PAS, classify the nevus, and determine the indication for neuroimaging based on established risk criteria.", "problem": "A newborn presents with a solitary congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) on the head and neck region. The largest surface-measured diameter of the lesion at birth is $6.0 \\text{ cm}$. For the head and neck site, the established body site-specific growth multiplier to estimate the Projected Adult Size (PAS) is $1.7$. Use the following foundational definitions and rules:\n\n1. PAS is defined as the product of the birth diameter and the site-specific growth multiplier. That is, the adult-projected greatest diameter is the scaled estimate of the neonatal measurement by the appropriate growth factor.\n\n2. Size category thresholds based on PAS are as follows:\n   - Small: $PAS  1.5 \\text{ cm}$.\n   - Medium: $1.5 \\text{ cm} \\leq PAS  20 \\text{ cm}$.\n   - Large/Giant: $PAS \\geq 20 \\text{ cm}$.\n\n3.

The calculated value of $10.2$ already has three significant figures. Thus, the PAS is $10.2$ centimeters.\n\n**2.

We evaluate the inequalities:\n- Is $10.2  1.5$? False.\n- Is $1.5 \\leq 10.2  20$? True.\n- Is $10.2 \\geq 20$? False.\n\nThe PAS falls within the Medium category. The corresponding code for the Medium category is $2$.\n\n**3. Determine if MRI is indicated.**\nThe indication for MRI is based on a set of rules.\n- **Rule A:** MRI is indicated if $PAS \\geq 20$ cm.\n  - Since $PAS = 10.2$ cm, the condition $10.2 \\geq 20$ is false. Rule A does not indicate an MRI.\n\n- **Rule B:** MRI is indicated if the PAS is in the medium category AND there are $\\geq 2$ high-risk modifiers.\n  - The first part of this condition, \"PAS is in the medium category,\" is true, as determined in the previous step.\n  - The second part requires us to count the number of present high-risk modifiers for this specific case.\n    1. Posterior axial location: The problem states the lesion is on the anterior head and neck, so this modifier is absent.\n    2. $\\geq 3$ satellite nevi: The problem states there are $0$ satellites. The condition is $0 \\geq 3$, which is false. This modifier is absent.\n    3. Evolving neurological signs: The problem states there are $0$ neurological signs. This modifier is absent.\n  - The total number of present high-risk modifiers is $0$. The condition is that the number of modifiers must be $\\geq 2$. Since $0  2$, the second part of Rule B is false.\n\n- Since Rule B is a logical conjunction (AND), both parts must be true for the rule to be true. As the second part is false, Rule B as a whole is false and does not indicate an MRI.\n\nSince neither Rule A nor Rule B is satisfied, MRI is not indicated.

The provided case descriptions and fundamental principles allow us to establish the defining characteristics of each entity.\n\n**1. Analysis of Case 1 and Identification as Becker Nevus:**\n- **Age of Onset:** Adolescent patient, lesion enlargement around puberty. This aligns with the principle that androgens rise at puberty.\n- **Androgen Sensitivity:** Lesion enlarges at puberty, develops coarse hair and comedones (acneiform changes), and IHC confirms strong AR expression in keratinocytes and arrector pili muscles. This directly links the lesion's changes to androgen stimulation, consistent with an androgen-sensitive hamartoma.\n- **Hypertrichosis:** Coarse terminal hair develops *within* the patch that was previously present, a classic feature.\n- **Histopathology/IHC:** The lesion is described as having epidermal acanthosis, basal hyperpigmentation, and smooth muscle (arrector pili) hypertrophy. Crucially, there are **no dermal nests of melanocytes**. This rules out a melanocytic nevus and points to a hamartoma involving the epidermis and dermal smooth muscle. The absence of Melan-A or HMB-45 staining in the dermis confirms the lack of dermal nevus cells.\n- **Conclusion for Case 1:** The collection of features—peripubertal onset, androgen sensitivity, and hamartomatous histology without dermal melanocytic nests—is the defining profile of a **Becker nevus**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Case 2 and Identification as Congenital Melanocytic Nevus (CMN):**\n- **Age of Onset:** Noted at birth. This is the definition of \"congenital.\"\n- **Androgen Sensitivity:** The lesion and its hair growth start long before puberty (early childhood). No mention is made of androgenic influence or AR overexpression, suggesting this is not the primary driver.\n- **Hypertrichosis:** Progressive but patchy terminal hair growth began in early childhood, consistent with the developmental nature of the lesion.\n- **Histopathology/IHC:** The lesion shows dermal nests and cords of melanocytic (nevus) cells extending deep and tracking along adnexal and neurovascular structures. This is the hallmark of a CMN. The concept of \"maturation\" (cells becoming smaller and more spindled with depth) is described. The IHC pattern (S-100+, Melan-A+, with HMB-45 staining decreasing with depth) is the classic immunophenotype of a maturing melanocytic nevus.\n- **Conclusion for Case 2:** The collection of features—presence at birth, characteristic hypertrichosis, and deep dermal proliferation of maturing nevus cells—is the defining profile of a **Congenital Melanocytic Nevus (CMN)**.\n\n**3. Differentiation Summary:**\n- **Becker Nevus:** Peripubertal onset, androgen-driven (AR overexpression), late-onset hypertrichosis, histologically an epidermal and smooth muscle hamartoma with basal hyperpigmentation but **no dermal nevus cell nests**.\n- **Congenital Melanocytic Nevus (CMN):** Congenital onset (at birth), not primarily androgen-driven, often early-onset hypertrichosis, histologically a true melanocytic nevus with **dermal nests of nevus cells** showing maturation and a characteristic IHC pattern (S-100+, Melan-A+, decreasing HMB-45 with depth).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. CMN typically presents at birth or within the first $1$ year, is not primarily androgen-driven, often exhibits early-onset patchy hypertrichosis, and shows dermal nests of nevus cells with adnexal and perineural involvement, neurotization (maturation), and a superficial-to-deep decrease in HMB-45 labeling with S-100/Melan-A positivity; Becker nevus typically appears peripubertally ($\\approx 10$–$20$ years), is androgen-sensitive with AR overexpression, develops coarse terminal hair after lesion onset, and shows epidermal acanthosis, basal hypermelanosis, elongated rete ridges, and increased arrector pili smooth muscle without dermal nevus cell nests.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option accurately summarizes all the key differentiating features for both CMN and Becker nevus, consistent with the case analyses and fundamental principles provided. Each point of comparison (age of onset, androgen sensitivity, hypertrichosis, histopathology/IHC) is correctly stated for both entities.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. CMN typically appears peripubertally due to androgen surge, exhibits strong AR overexpression, and shows epidermal acanthosis with basal hypermelanosis but no nevus cell nests; Becker nevus is present at birth, has low AR expression, and shows deep dermal nevus cell nests with maturation and adnexal tracking.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option completely inverts the characteristics of the two conditions. The description given for CMN is actually that of Becker nevus, and the description for Becker nevus is that of CMN.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. CMN and Becker nevus both present at birth; both are androgen-driven; both show prominent dermal nevus cell nests with strong HMB-45 labeling increasing with depth; hypertrichosis in both conditions is absent until late adulthood.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option contains multiple errors. Becker nevus does not present at birth. CMN is not primarily androgen-driven. Becker nevus does not have dermal nevus cell nests. HMB-45 labeling decreases, not increases, with depth in CMN. Hypertrichosis onset is incorrect for both.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. CMN presents at birth but is characterized by epidermal hamartoma changes with smooth muscle hyperplasia and strong AR expression; Becker nevus presents perinatally and shows dermal melanocytic nests with neurotization and adnexal involvement; in both, HMB-45 increases with depth as cells mature.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option incorrectly assigns the histopathology of Becker nevus to CMN. It incorrectly states the onset of Becker nevus as perinatal (it is peripubertal) and incorrectly assigns the histology of CMN to it. The statement that HMB-45 increases with depth is factually wrong.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. CMN presents at birth, is androgen-sensitive with AR overexpression, and shows epidermal changes without melanocytic nests; Becker nevus presents at puberty, is not androgen-sensitive, and shows deep dermal melanocytic nests positive for Melan-A and HMB-45 with increasing labeling in deeper dermis.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option incorrectly claims CMN is androgen-sensitive and lacks melanocytic nests. It incorrectly claims Becker nevus is not androgen-sensitive and has deep dermal melanocytic nests. The claim of increasing HMB-45 with depth is also incorrect. It confuses multiple features between the two entities.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4422484"}, {"introduction": "One of the most critical responsibilities in managing patients with CMN, particularly large nevi, is surveillance for malignant transformation.

The described features are standard criteria for differentiating benign from malignant melanocytic lesions.

It presents a realistic and solvable clinical case. Therefore, I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\n**Part 1: Synthesis of Diagnosis**\nThe primary diagnostic consideration is between a benign proliferative nodule (PN), which can occur in CMN, and a melanoma arising within the CMN. The provided guiding principle and histopathological findings allow for a definitive distinction.\n\n1.  ** Architectural and Cytological Features:** The lesion is described as asymmetrical with sheet-like growth. Maturation, the process where nevus cells become smaller with descent into the dermis, is absent. Atypical mitotic figures are present. These features—asymmetry, lack of maturation, and atypical mitoses—are hallmarks of melanoma. Focal ulceration is another significant adverse prognostic feature associated with melanoma.\n2.  **Proliferation and Antigen Expression (IHC):**\n    *   **Ki-67 Index:** A value of approximately 35% is exceptionally high for a benign melanocytic lesion and strongly supports a diagnosis of melanoma. While PNs can show elevated proliferation, it is typically in a lower range and confined to specific zones, not diffusely high.\n    *   **HMB-45 Expression:** In benign nevi, expression of melanocytic maturation markers like HMB-45 decreases or is lost as cells descend into the deeper dermis (a phenomenon known as \"loss of expression with depth\" or \"maturation\"). The finding of diffuse and strong HMB-45 positivity from top to bottom is a key feature of melanoma, indicating a loss of this normal maturation pattern.\n    *   **pHH3 Staining:** The confirmation of atypical mitoses with pHH3, a specific marker for cells in mitosis, solidifies the finding of abnormal proliferative activity.\n\n**Conclusion on Diagnosis:** The combination of clinical (rapid growth), histopathological (asymmetry, ulceration, lack of maturation, atypical mitoses), and IHC (high Ki-67, diffuse HMB-45) findings overwhelmingly supports the diagnosis of **melanoma arising within a congenital melanocytic nevus**.\n\n**Part 2: Next Best Step in Management**\nThe initial biopsy was an *incisional* biopsy. This means only a part of the tumor was removed. While this is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of melanoma, it is insufficient for proper staging. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging for melanoma requires the **Breslow thickness** (the vertical thickness of the tumor from the granular layer of the epidermis to the deepest point of invasion, measured in millimeters) and the **presence or absence of ulceration**. These cannot be determined accurately from an incisional or partial biopsy.\n\nThe management of localized melanoma is a stepwise process:\n1.  **Full-thickness Biopsy for Staging:** The first step is always to obtain an accurate T-stage (pT), which is primarily determined by Breslow thickness and ulceration. Since this was not done initially, the immediate next step is to perform a procedure that accomplishes this. A **complete excisional biopsy** of the remainder of the melanoma nodule with narrow margins ($1-3$ mm) is required. This allows the pathologist to measure the\n    full tumor thickness.\n2.  **Definitive Surgical Resection:** Once the final Breslow thickness is known, a **wide local excision (WLE)** is performed. The surgical margins for the WLE are determined by the thickness:\n    *   Melanoma in situ: $0.5-1.0$ cm margin.\n    *   Thickness $\\le 1.0$ mm: $1.0$ cm margin.\n    *   Thickness $1.01 - 2.0$ mm: $1.0-2.0$ cm margin.\n    *   Thickness $> 2.0$ mm: $2.0$ cm margin.\n3.  **Nodal Staging:** A **sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)** is a staging procedure to detect microscopic metastasis in regional lymph nodes. According to current guidelines, such as from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), SLNB should be discussed and considered for patients with melanomas of Breslow thickness $\\ge 1.0$ mm, or for melanomas $\\ge 0.8$ mm if additional adverse features (such as ulceration, as seen in this case) are present.\n\nThe correct management plan must follow this logical, evidence-based sequence.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Proliferative nodule arising in a congenital melanocytic nevus; observe with short-interval clinical follow-up because high Ki-67 is expected in proliferative nodules; no further surgery needed.**\n-   **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. The constellation of findings (especially atypical mitoses, ulceration, and lack of HMB-45 maturation) is diagnostic of melanoma, not a benign proliferative nodule.\n-   **Management:** Incorrect. Observation is grossly inappropriate for a diagnosed melanoma.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Melanoma arising within a congenital melanocytic nevus; proceed directly to definitive wide local excision with a fixed $2$ cm margin and omit nodal staging because congenital melanocytic nevi distort lymphatic mapping.**\n-   **Diagnosis:** Correct.\n-   **Management:** Incorrect. It is improper to perform a WLE with a fixed $2$ cm margin without knowing the Breslow thickness, as this may be overtreatment for a thinner melanoma. More importantly, it bypasses the critical step of obtaining the Breslow thickness for staging. The claim that SLNB should be omitted due to CMN is an oversimplification and not standard practice; lymphoscintigraphy is used precisely to map lymphatic drainage, even if complex.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Melanoma arising within a congenital melanocytic nevus; perform complete excisional biopsy with narrow ($1$–$2$ mm) margins to obtain accurate Breslow thickness and ulceration status, then plan wide local excision with margins according to thickness and discuss sentinel lymph node biopsy if thickness is $\\geq 1.0$ mm or if thickness is $\\geq 0.8$ mm with ulceration.**\n-   **Diagnosis:** Correct.\n-   **Management:** Correct. This option perfectly describes the standard, logical, and stepwise oncologic management. It correctly identifies the immediate need to complete the excision for accurate staging (Breslow thickness and ulceration status). It then correctly bases subsequent management (WLE margins and SLNB discussion) on that critical staging information, using criteria that align with current evidence-based guidelines.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. Nodular melanoma; order immediate systemic imaging and initiate adjuvant immunotherapy without further surgery because the high Ki-67 and diffuse HMB-45 imply systemic disease.**\n-   **Diagnosis:** Partially correct (it is a nodular melanoma).\n-   **Management:** Incorrect. This approach is critically flawed. Definitive surgical resection of the primary tumor is the cornerstone of treatment for localized melanoma. Systemic imaging and adjuvant therapy are considered *after* completion of local staging and treatment, and are not a substitute for it. The patient's disease stage is unknown, and initiating adjuvant therapy is inappropriate at this point.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Melanoma in situ; treat with topical imiquimod because the lesion is confined to the epidermis and adnexa when HMB-45 is diffuse.**\n-   **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. The histopathology describes a \"dermal proliferation,\" which by definition means the melanoma is invasive, not *in situ* (which is confined to the epidermis). A $1.5$ cm dermal nodule is fundamentally inconsistent with melanoma *in situ*.\n-   **Management:** Incorrect. Topical imiquimod is not a standard treatment for invasive nodular melanoma. Surgical excision is the standard of care.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4422477"}]}
