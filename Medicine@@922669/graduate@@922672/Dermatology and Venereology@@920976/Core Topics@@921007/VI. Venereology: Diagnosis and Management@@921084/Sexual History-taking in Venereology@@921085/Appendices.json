The term $(1 - E)$ is the residual risk factor.\n\nFor condoms, the efficacy is $E_c = 0.80$. The residual risk factor for condoms is:\n$$ R_c = 1 - E_c = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 $$\nThe probability of transmission with condoms alone would be $p_c = p \\cdot R_c = p(1 - E_c)$.\n\nFor PrEP, the efficacy is $E_p = 0.99$.

Derivation of the Sampling Distribution of the Sample Proportion $\\hat{p}$**\n\nLet the outcome of each of the $n=200$ independent encounters be represented by a random variable $X_i$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$. Let $X_i=1$ if the sexual history is complete (success) and $X_i=0$ otherwise (failure).

It is the mean of the sample random variables:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i $$\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that for a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the sampling distribution of the sample mean ($\\hat{p}$ in this case) of independent and identically distributed random variables is approximately normal. The mean of this normal distribution is the population mean $\\mu$, and the variance is the population variance $\\sigma^2$ divided by the sample size $n$.\n\nApplying the CLT to $\\hat{p}$:\n- The mean of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is $E[\\hat{p}] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] = \\frac{1}{n}(np) = p$.\n- The variance of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{Var}(X_i) = \\frac{1}{n^2}(n \\cdot p(1-p)) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.\n\nTherefore, the large-sample normal approximation for the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is:\n$$ \\hat{p} \\sim N\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right) $$\nThis means the standardized variable $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} \\sim N(0, 1) $$\n\n**2.
