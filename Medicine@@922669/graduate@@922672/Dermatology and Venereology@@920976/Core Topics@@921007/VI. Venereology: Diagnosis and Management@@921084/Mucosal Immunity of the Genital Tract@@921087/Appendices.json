Consider two differentiated, air–liquid interface cultures under identical bathing conditions: a multilayered vaginal squamous epithelium and a monolayer endocervical columnar epithelium.

We can proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to relate a macroscopic electrical property, the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), to a macroscopic transport property, the paracellular permeability coefficient ($P_s$), by using a microscopic model of the transport pathway. The model assumes that both ionic current and solute diffusion occur through the same set of parallel cylindrical pores, which represent the tight junctions.\n\nLet us first derive an expression for the area-normalized resistance, or TEER. We model the paracellular pathway as an ensemble of $N$ identical cylindrical pores distributed over a total epithelial area $A_{\\text{total}}$. Each pore has a length $L$ (equal to the epithelial thickness) and a cross-sectional area $A_p$. The bathing medium has a uniform conductivity $\\sigma$.\n\nThe electrical resistance of a single pore, $R_{\\text{pore}}$, is given by Ohm's law for a bulk conductor:\n$$R_{\\text{pore}} = \\frac{\\rho L}{A_p} = \\frac{L}{\\sigma A_p}$$\nwhere $\\rho = 1/\\sigma$ is the resistivity of the medium inside the pore.\n\nSince all $N$ pores are in parallel, the total resistance of the epithelial sheet, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is found by summing the conductances:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{pore}}} = \\frac{N}{R_{\\text{pore}}} = \\frac{N \\sigma A_p}{L}$$\nTherefore, the total resistance is:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{L}{N \\sigma A_p}$$\nThe problem defines TEER as the area-normalized resistance. We will denote this as $R_{TEER}$.\n$$R_{TEER} = R_{\\text{total}} \\times A_{\\text{total}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{N \\sigma A_p}\\right) A_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{L}{\\sigma} \\left(\\frac{A_{\\text{total}}}{N A_p}\\right)$$\nLet us define the fractional pore area, $\\alpha$, as the ratio of the total pore area ($N A_p$) to the total epithelial area ($A_{\\text{total}}$):\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{N A_p}{A_{\\text{total}}}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the expression for TEER gives:\n$$R_{TEER} = \\frac{L}{\\sigma \\alpha} \\quad (1)$$\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the paracellular permeability coefficient, $P_s$, for the neutral tracer. According to Fick's first law, the molar flux $J_s$ (moles per unit area per unit time) is proportional to the concentration gradient. For transport across a barrier of thickness $L$ with a concentration difference $\\Delta C$, the flux through the pores, $J_{\\text{pore}}$, is:\n$$J_{\\text{pore}} = D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta C}{L}$$\nwhere $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective diffusion coefficient of the tracer within the pore. The problem states that steric and hydrodynamic hindrance reduces the free diffusion coefficient $D_s$ by a factor $H$, so $D_{\\text{eff}} = H D_s$.\nThe total molar transport rate across the epithelium, $\\dot{n}$, is the flux through the pores multiplied by the total area available for diffusion, which is the total pore area $N A_p$:\n$$\\dot{n} = J_{\\text{pore}} \\times (N A_p) = \\left(\\frac{H D_s \\Delta C}{L}\\right) (N A_p)$$\nThe macroscopic permeability coefficient $P_s$ is defined in terms of the flux across the total epithelial area, $J_{\\text{total}} = \\dot{n} / A_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$J_{\\text{total}} = P_s \\Delta C$$\nBy combining the previous equations, we can write $J_{\\text{total}}$ as:\n$$J_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\dot{n}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{(H D_s \\Delta C / L) (N A_p)}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{H D_s \\Delta C}{L} \\left(\\frac{N A_p}{A_{\\text{total}}}\\right) = \\frac{H D_s \\alpha \\Delta C}{L}$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $J_{\\text{total}} = P_s \\Delta C$, we can identify the expression for $P_s$:\n$$P_s = \\frac{H D_s \\alpha}{L} \\quad (2)$$\n\nNow we can derive the dependence of $P_s$ on $R_{TEER}$. From equation (1), we can express the geometric term $\\alpha/L$ as:\n$$\\frac{\\alpha}{L} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma R_{TEER}}$$\nSubstituting this into equation (2) gives the desired relationship:\n$$P_s = H D_s \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{L}\\right) = \\frac{H D_s}{\\sigma R_{TEER}}$$\nThis result shows that the paracellular permeability coefficient $P_s$ is inversely proportional to the transepithelial electrical resistance $R_{TEER}$, under the stated assumptions. The geometric parameters of the pores ($L$, $N$, $A_p$, $\\alpha$) have been eliminated.\n\nWe are asked to compute the relative paracellular permeability ratio $P_{\\text{vag}}/P_{\\text{endo}}$. Using the derived relationship for each epithelium:\n$$P_{\\text{vag}} = \\frac{H D_s}{\\sigma R_{\\text{vag}}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{endo}} = \\frac{H D_s}{\\sigma R_{\\text{endo}}}$$\nThe problem states that the tracer ($D_s$), the bathing medium conductivity ($\\sigma$), and the hindrance factor ($H$) are identical for both epithelial cultures. Therefore, when we take the ratio of the permeabilities, these terms cancel:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\text{vag}}}{P_{\\text{endo}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{H D_s}{\\sigma R_{\\text{vag}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{H D_s}{\\sigma R_{\\text{endo}}}\\right)} = \\frac{R_{\\text{endo}}}{R_{\\text{vag}}}$$\nThe relative permeability is simply the inverse ratio of the TEER values.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values: $R_{\\text{vag}} = 420\\,\\text{Ω·cm}^{2}$ and $R_{\\text{endo}} = 1050\\,\\text{Ω·cm}^{2}$. Note that the units cancel, so no conversion is necessary.\n$$\\frac{P_{\\text{vag}}}{P_{\\text{endo}}} = \\frac{1050\\,\\text{Ω·cm}^{2}}{420\\,\\text{Ω·cm}^{2}} = \\frac{1050}{420} = \\frac{105}{42} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. Thus, the ratio is $2.500$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks which epithelium is more susceptible to paracellular pathogen translocation, under the assumption that this rate is proportional to $P_s$. Since our calculated ratio is $\\frac{P_{\\text{vag}}}{P_{\\text{endo}}} = 2.5$, it follows that $P_{\\text{vag}} = 2.5 \\times P_{\\text{endo}}$. The permeability of the vaginal epithelium is $2.5$ times greater than that of the endocervical epithelium.

Substituting these definitions yields the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation in its most general form, expressed in terms of activities:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{a_{A^{-}}}{a_{HA}}\\right)$$\nThis equation is exact but impractical for direct use, as activities are not directly measurable in routine laboratory analysis, whereas concentrations are. To express the equation in terms of measurable concentrations, we use the relation $a_{i} = \\gamma_{i}[i]$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{A^{-}}[A^{-}]}{\\gamma_{HA}[HA]}\\right)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{A^{-}}}{\\gamma_{HA}}\\right) + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)$$\nThe conventional form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using concentrations is:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)$$\nTo obtain this form, a key assumption is required.\n\n**Assumption:** The ratio of the activity coefficients of the conjugate base and the acid is unity, i.e., $\\dfrac{\\gamma_{A^{-}}}{\\gamma_{HA}} = 1$. This causes the term $\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{A^{-}}}{\\gamma_{HA}}\\right)$ to become $\\log_{10}(1) = 0$. This assumption simplifies the rigorous expression to the conventional one. In practice, this assumption is approximated by using an \"apparent\" or \"conditional\" dissociation constant, often denoted $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}'$, which is determined experimentally under specific conditions of ionic strength and temperature. This apparent constant is defined as $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}' = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{A^{-}}}{\\gamma_{HA}}\\right)$. The problem provides such an apparent constant ($\\mathrm{p}K_{a} = 3.86$) for the specific physiological conditions. Using this apparent $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ allows for the direct use of concentrations in the formula, as the effects of non-ideal solution behavior are implicitly incorporated into the value of the constant itself. The instruction to \"treat activities as approximated by concentrations\" is consistent with this approach.\n\n### Calculation of Vaginal Fluid pH\n\nUsing the derived and justified Henderson-Hasselbalch relation, we calculate the $\\mathrm{pH}$ of the vaginal fluid sample.
