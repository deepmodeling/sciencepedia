The prevalence of the disease, $p$, is the prior probability of having the disease, $p = P(D)$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p$.\n\nThe performance characteristics of the test are given by its sensitivity and specificity.\n- Sensitivity, $S_{\\mathrm{e}}$, is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease: $S_{\\mathrm{e}} = P(T^{+} \\mid D)$.\n- Specificity, $S_{\\mathrm{p}}$, is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease: $S_{\\mathrm{p}} = P(T^{-} \\mid D^c)$.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the absence of the disease: $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) = 1 - S_{\\mathrm{p}}$.\n\nThe a-posteriori probability of interest is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the probability that a subject has the disease given that they have tested positive: $\\text{PPV} = P(D \\mid T^{+})$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the PPV can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}\n$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, represents the total probability of a positive test.
