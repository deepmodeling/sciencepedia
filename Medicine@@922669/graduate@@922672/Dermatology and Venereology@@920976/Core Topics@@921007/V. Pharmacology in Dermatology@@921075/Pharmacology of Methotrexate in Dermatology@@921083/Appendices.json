It is scientifically grounded in established pharmacokinetic principles, its definitions are internally consistent, and it is well-posed, admitting a unique and meaningful solution. All data required for the derivation and subsequent calculation are provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the pharmacokinetic half-life, $t_{1/2}$, in terms of clearance, $CL$, and volume of distribution, $V_d$, and then to compute its value for methotrexate.\n\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$, and let $C(t)$ be the plasma concentration of the drug at time $t$. The problem provides the following core definitions for a one-compartment model with first-order elimination:\n\n$1$. The volume of distribution, $V_d$, relates the amount of drug in the body to the plasma concentration:\n$$A(t) = V_d \\cdot C(t)$$\n\n$2$. Clearance, $CL$, relates the rate of drug elimination to the plasma concentration. The rate of elimination is given by $-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$:\n$$-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\n\n$3$. The elimination process is first-order, meaning the rate of elimination is also proportional to the amount of drug in the body, with an elimination rate constant $k$:\n$$-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = k \\cdot A(t)$$\n\n$4$. The pharmacokinetic half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is the time required for the plasma concentration to fall to one-half of its initial value, $C(0)$:\n$$C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$$\n\nFirst, we establish a relationship between $k$, $CL$, and $V_d$. We can equate the two expressions for the rate of elimination from definitions $(2)$ and $(3)$:\n$$CL \\cdot C(t) = k \\cdot A(t)$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $A(t)$ from definition $(1)$ into this equation:\n$$CL \\cdot C(t) = k \\cdot (V_d \\cdot C(t))$$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration $C(t)$, we can divide both sides by $C(t)$ to find the fundamental relationship between these parameters:\n$$CL = k \\cdot V_d$$\nThis allows us to express the first-order elimination rate constant $k$ in terms of $CL$ and $V_d$:\n$$k = \\frac{CL}{V_d}$$\n\nNext, we derive the time course of the plasma concentration. We start with the definition of clearance, $-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = CL \\cdot C(t)$. We can express $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$ in terms of the concentration $C(t)$ by differentiating definition $(1)$ with respect to time, assuming $V_d$ is a constant:\n$$\\frac{d A(t)}{dt} = V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$$\nSubstituting this into the clearance equation gives:\n$$-V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Rearranging it, we get:\n$$\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} \\cdot C(t)$$\nRecognizing that $k = \\frac{CL}{V_d}$, we can write:\n$$\\frac{dC(t)}{C(t)} = -k \\cdot dt$$\nIntegrating this equation from time $t=0$ to a later time $t$ yields:\n$$\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\cdot dt'$$\n$$\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -kt$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -kt$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the equation for exponential decay of concentration:\n$$C(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt)$$\nNow we apply the definition of half-life, $t_{1/2}$, where $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} C(0) = C(0) \\exp(-k \\cdot t_{1/2})$$\nDividing by $C(0)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k \\cdot t_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k \\cdot t_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k \\cdot t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$ gives the general expression for half-life in a first-order process:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\nFinally, we substitute our previously derived expression for $k = \\frac{CL}{V_d}$ into this equation to obtain the desired relationship:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\left(\\frac{CL}{V_d}\\right)} = \\frac{V_d \\ln(2)}{CL}$$\nThis is the derived expression for half-life in terms of volume of distribution and clearance.\n\nThe problem provides the following values for methotrexate: $V_d = 20 \\ \\mathrm{L}$ and $CL = 6 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}$.

This finding appears paradoxical given that methotrexate is administered on a once-weekly basis for dermatological conditions like psoriasis. The rationale lies in the distinction between the drug's pharmacokinetics (its concentration in plasma) and its pharmacodynamics (its effect at the cellular level). Methotrexate's therapeutic efficacy is not directly driven by its plasma concentration. Upon entering target cells, such as keratinocytes and activated T-lymphocytes, methotrexate is metabolized by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase into methotrexate polyglutamates (MTX-PGs). These polyglutamated metabolites are large, charged molecules that are effectively trapped within the cell, leading to a very long intracellular half-life (on the order of days to weeks). Furthermore, these MTX-PGs are potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and other key enzymes in the folate pathway. The prolonged intracellular retention of active MTX-PGs provides a sustained antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effect long after the parent methotrexate drug has been cleared from the plasma. Therefore, the short plasma half-life allows for rapid systemic clearance, minimizing time-dependent toxicity, while the long intracellular half-life of its active metabolites permits a convenient and effective once-weekly dosing regimen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.31}$$", "id": "4471979"}, {"introduction": "The sustained clinical effect of methotrexate, despite its rapid plasma clearance, is explained by its behavior at the cellular level.

Each transport process is described as a saturable system obeying the Michaelis-Menten framework for carrier-mediated transport.\n\nThe general form for the rate of transport, $J$, is given by:\n$$J = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximal transport capacity, $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant (the substrate concentration at which the transport rate is half of $V_{\\text{max}}$), and $[S]$ is the concentration of the substrate on the source side of the membrane.\n\nFor the influx process mediated by the Reduced Folate Carrier 1 (RFC1), the substrate is the extracellular methotrexate, $[MTX]_{out}$.

Rounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $16.67$ pmol/min.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we articulate the steady-state condition and its implications.\nSteady state is achieved when there is no further net change in the intracellular concentration of methotrexate. This occurs when the net flux, $J_{\\text{net}}$, is equal to zero. Mathematically, this condition is:\n$$J_{\\text{net}} = J_{\\text{in}} - J_{\\text{out}} = 0$$\nwhich implies that the rate of influx must equal the rate of efflux:\n$$J_{\\text{in}} = J_{\\text{out}}$$\nSubstituting the full kinetic expressions gives the equation that defines the steady-state intracellular concentration, $[MTX]_{in,ss}$:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\text{max,in}} [MTX]_{out}}{K_{m,\\text{in}} + [MTX]_{out}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{max,out}} [MTX]_{in,ss}}{K_{m,\\text{out}} + [MTX]_{in,ss}}$$\n\nQualitatively, the implications of the given parameters can be understood by analyzing this balance. The left-hand side of the equation represents a constant influx rate, determined by the fixed extracellular concentration $[MTX]_{out} = 2$ $\\mu$M. This influx rate is the value we calculated previously, $J_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{50}{3}$ pmol/min. For the system to reach steady state, the intracellular concentration $[MTX]_{in}$ must increase from its initial value of $0$ to a level, $[MTX]_{in,ss}$, that is sufficient to drive the efflux pump (ABCG2) at this exact rate.\n\nThe efflux pump has a maximal capacity $V_{\\text{max,out}} = 50$ pmol/min. Since the required efflux rate ($\\frac{50}{3}$ pmol/min, which is approximately $16.67$ pmol/min) is less than this maximum, a steady state is achievable. The efficiency of the influx transporter ($V_{\\text{max,in}}=100, K_{m,in}=10$) at the given low external concentration ($[MTX]_{out}=2$) establishes an influx rate. The cell will accumulate methotrexate until the internal concentration $[MTX]_{in,ss}$ is high enough for the efflux transporter ($V_{\\text{max,out}}=50, K_{m,out}=5$) to exactly counteract this influx. The interplay of all four kinetic parameters determines whether $[MTX]_{in,ss}$ will be lower than, equal to, or higher than $[MTX]_{out}$. In this specific case, the parameters lead to a situation where the intracellular concentration at steady state ($[MTX]_{in,ss} = 2.5$ $\\mu$M, by solving the steady-state equation) is higher than the extracellular concentration ($[MTX]_{out} = 2$ $\\mu$M), indicating net cellular accumulation of the drug despite the presence of a potent efflux pump. This outcome arises from the complete system dynamics, not from a simple comparison of individual parameters like $V_{\\text{max}}$ or $K_m$ values alone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16.67}$$", "id": "4472033"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the goal of pharmacotherapy is to achieve a desired clinical effect.
