The analysis begins with Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension, which is given as:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\n$$\nHere, $J$ is the diffusion flux (amount of substance per unit area per unit time), $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $C$ is the concentration of the diffusing substance, and $x$ is the position coordinate normal to the surface of the skin.\n\nThe problem specifies several conditions for modeling the system:\n1.  Diffusion is at steady state, which implies that the flux $J$ is constant with respect to position $x$.\n2.  The SC is a homogeneous slab, meaning the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant throughout the SC.\n3.  There is a linear concentration profile across the SC. This is consistent with the steady-state assumption for a homogeneous medium, as integrating $dC/dx = -J/D = \\text{constant}$ yields a linear function for $C(x)$.\n\nWe can integrate Fick's law across the thickness of the SC, from the outer surface at $x=0$ to the interface with the viable epidermis (VE) at $x=L$:\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(L)} dC = -\\frac{J}{D} \\int_{0}^{L} dx\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\nC(L) - C(0) = -\\frac{J L}{D}\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state flux $J$, we get:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{D (C(0) - C(L))}{L}\n$$\nThe problem states that only the unbound (free) fraction of the retinoid in the SC contributes to diffusion. Therefore, $C(x)$ in the equation above refers to the free concentration of the retinoid.\n\nNext, we establish the boundary conditions for the free concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{free}}(x)$.\nAt the outer surface of the SC ($x=0$), the tissue is in equilibrium with the vehicle. The total concentration in the SC is given by $C_{\\mathrm{SC,outer}} = K C_{\\mathrm{vehicle}}$, where $K$ is the vehicle-to-SC partition coefficient and $C_{\\mathrm{vehicle}}$ is the concentration in the vehicle. The free concentration at this boundary is the product of the free fraction, $f$, and the total concentration:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{free}}(0) = f C_{\\mathrm{SC,outer}} = f K C_{\\mathrm{vehicle}}\n$$\nAt the interface between the SC and the VE ($x=L$), the system acts as a \"perfect sink\". This means the retinoid is rapidly cleared, and its concentration is effectively zero:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{free}}(L) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these boundary conditions into the expression for flux:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{D (f K C_{\\mathrm{vehicle}} - 0)}{L} = \\frac{D f K C_{\\mathrm{vehicle}}}{L}\n$$\nThis equation allows us to calculate the steady-state flux for each retinoid.
