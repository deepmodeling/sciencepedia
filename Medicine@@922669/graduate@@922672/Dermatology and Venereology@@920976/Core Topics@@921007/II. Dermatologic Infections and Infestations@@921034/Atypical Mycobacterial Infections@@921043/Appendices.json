The patient's occupation, exposure history (aquarium), a lesion on an extremity with sporotrichoid spread, and optimal growth at cooler temperatures are all well-established features of certain atypical mycobacterial infections. The Runyon classification, though somewhat outdated in the era of molecular diagnostics, remains a fundamental concept in clinical microbiology for NTM identification based on phenotypic traits (growth rate and pigmentation). The histopathological and staining results are also textbook findings. The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of dermatology, infectious diseases, and microbiology.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated and provides sufficient, consistent information to arrive at a single, logical conclusion. All data points (clinical, histological, and microbiological) are relevant and contribute to the differential diagnosis.\n-   **Objective:** The language is clinical and neutral, describing observations without subjective interpretation or bias.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and solvable problem within the specified domain.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe diagnosis can be established by systematically integrating the clinical, histopathological, and microbiological data.\n\n1.  **Clinical Context:** The patient is an immunocompetent adult working in an aquarium shop who sustained minor trauma while cleaning a saltwater tank. Following an incubation period of approximately $2$ weeks ($8$ weeks from trauma minus $6$ weeks of lesion history), he developed a primary lesion on his finger that spread proximally along lymphatic channels (sporotrichoid lymphocutaneous spread). This clinical syndrome, especially in the context of aquatic exposure, is highly suggestive of infection with *Mycobacterium marinum*, a condition commonly known as \"fish tank granuloma\" or \"swimming pool granuloma.\"\n\n2.  **Microbiological Analysis:** The culture results provide definitive clues to the identity of the causative organism.\n    -   **Growth Rate:** Growth appearing in $14$ days (i.e., $2$ weeks) classifies the organism as a **slow grower**. The Runyon classification system defines slow growers as those requiring more than $7$ days for visible colonies to appear on solid media. This finding immediately excludes Runyon Group $\\mathrm{IV}$ (rapid growers).\n    -   **Pigment Production (Chromogenicity):** The colonies are described as developing a bright yellow pigment *only after* exposure to light. This phenomenon defines the organism as a **photochromogen**.\n    -   **Temperature Requirement:** The organism grows at $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ but fails to grow at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. This indicates a preference for cooler temperatures, which is characteristic of mycobacteria found in aquatic environments and correlates with their tendency to cause infections in the cooler, acral parts of the human body (hands, feet, elbows).\n\n3.  **Runyon Classification:** The Runyon system categorizes NTM based on growth rate and pigment production:\n    -   **Runyon Group I:** Slow-growing photochromogens (produce pigment only after light exposure).\n    -   **Runyon Group II:** Slow-growing scotochromogens (produce pigment in both light and dark).\n    -   **Runyon Group III:** Slow-growing nonchromogens (produce no significant pigment).\n    -   **Runyon Group IV:** Rapid growers (grow in less than $7$ days).\n\n    Based on the microbiological data (slow growth and photochromogenicity), the organism in this case belongs to **Runyon Group I**.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing Clinical and Microbiological Data:**\n    -   The clinical picture points strongly to *M. marinum*.\n    -   The microbiological findings—a slow-growing photochromogen that prefers $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for growth—are the defining laboratory characteristics of *M. marinum*.\n    -   Therefore, the pairing of *Mycobacterium marinum* and Runyon Group $\\mathrm{I}$ is the most logical diagnosis.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Mycobacterium marinum — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{I}$ (photochromogen)**\n   -   *M. marinum* is the classic cause of fish tank granuloma, matching the clinical history (aquarium worker, saltwater tank exposure) and presentation (sporotrichoid spread from a distal extremity).\n   -   It is a slow grower, optimally at $30$–$32^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and fails to grow at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which matches the culture data perfectly.\n   -   It is the archetypal photochromogen in the Runyon classification, belonging to Group $\\mathrm{I}$. All features in the problem statement are consistent with this choice.\n   -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **Mycobacterium kansasii — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{I}$ (photochromogen)**\n   -   *M. kansasii* is indeed a photochromogen and thus belongs to Runyon Group $\\mathrm{I}$.\n   -   However, it primarily causes pulmonary disease and grows optimally at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The problem explicitly states there was no growth at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which rules out this species. The clinical context of aquatic exposure is also not typical for *M. kansasii*.\n   -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Mycobacterium fortuitum — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{IV}$ (rapid grower, nonchromogen)**\n   -   *M. fortuitum* is a rapid grower (Runyon Group $\\mathrm{IV}$), meaning it grows in less than $7$ days. The organism in the case grew in $14$ days, making it a slow grower. This is a direct contradiction.\n   -   Furthermore, *M. fortuitum* is typically nonchromogenic, whereas the cultured organism was a photochromogen.\n   -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Mycobacterium ulcerans — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{III}$ (nonchromogen)**\n   -   *M. ulcerans* grows optimally at cooler temperatures ($30$–$33^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), which is consistent with the problem. It causes extensive ulcerative skin disease (Buruli ulcer).\n   -   However, it is a nonchromogen (Runyon Group $\\mathrm{III}$), meaning it does not produce pigment. The organism in the case was a photochromogen. This is a direct contradiction.\n   -   *M. ulcerans* is also extremely slow-growing, typically requiring $6$–$8$ weeks or more for culture, which is significantly longer than the $14$ days reported here.\n   -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. **Mycobacterium haemophilum — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{III}$ (nonchromogen)**\n   -   *M. haemophilum* also prefers cooler growth temperatures ($28$–$32^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n   -   However, it is classified as a nonchromogen (Runyon Group $\\mathrm{III}$), contradicting the finding of photochromogenicity.\n   -   Additionally, *M. haemophilum* is a fastidious organism requiring iron-containing supplements like hemin or ferric ammonium citrate for growth on L-J medium; the problem makes no mention of such required supplementation.\n   -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4414500"}, {"introduction": "In clinical practice, a diagnosis is rarely certain from the outset; instead, it is a probability that evolves as new information is gathered.

In this clinic population with similar presentations, the baseline pretest probabilities are $P(\\mathrm{AMI}) = 0.30$, $P(\\mathrm{SFI}) = 0.40$, and $P(\\mathrm{Other}) = 0.30$.\n\nAn exposure history is elicited: the patient reports routinely cleaning a home salt-water aquarium with bare hands and having sustained small abrasions over the past month. Treat the exposure history as a binary diagnostic feature $E$ with the following conditional probabilities, derived from cohort data linking exposure to disease categories: $P(E \\mid \\mathrm{AMI}) = 0.55$, $P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SFI}) = 0.10$, and $P(E \\mid \\mathrm{Other}) = 0.08$.\n\nTwo laboratory studies are obtained from a lesion aspirate:\n- A fungal culture is performed. For SFI, the culture has sensitivity $0.88$; for non-fungal conditions (AMI and Other), the culture has specificity $0.97$. Let $C^{-}$ denote a negative fungal culture. Thus, $P(C^{-} \\mid \\mathrm{SFI}) = 0.12$, and for non-fungal conditions, $P(C^{-} \\mid \\mathrm{AMI}) = 0.97$ and $P(C^{-} \\mid \\mathrm{Other}) = 0.97$.\n- An acid-fast stain (AFS) for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) is performed.

Using Bayes’ theorem and the law of total probability as the fundamental base, first explain how the pretest probability of AMI shifts upon observing $E$ alone, starting from the baseline mixture across the three categories.

Compute the final posterior probability $P(\\mathrm{AMI} \\mid E, C^{-}, A^{+})$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard exercise in Bayesian inference applied to medical diagnostics. The clinical scenario (sporotrichoid rash, aquarium exposure, atypical mycobacteria like *Mycobacterium marinum*), the diagnostic tests (culture, stain), and the statistical concepts (sensitivity, specificity, pretest/posttest probability) are all well-established and realistic within the fields of dermatology and infectious disease.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary probabilities (priors and conditional probabilities/likelihoods) and a clear objective. The assumption of conditional independence is explicitly stated, which is a standard and necessary simplification for making such problems tractable. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe solution is determined by the application of Bayes’ theorem. Let $H_i$ represent the hypothesis that the patient has disease $i$, where $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{AMI}, \\mathrm{SFI}, \\mathrm{Other}\\}$. Let $D$ represent the observed data. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$P(H_i \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid H_i) P(H_i)}{P(D)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(D)$, is the total probability of observing the data, calculated using the law of total probability by summing over all possible hypotheses:\n$$P(D) = \\sum_{j} P(D \\mid H_j) P(H_j)$$\n\n**Part 1: Shift in Probability from Exposure History ($E$) Alone**\n\nFirst, we calculate the posterior probability of $\\mathrm{AMI}$ given only the exposure history, $P(\\mathrm{AMI} \\mid E)$. The data $D$ in this case is just the event $E$.\n$$P(\\mathrm{AMI} \\mid E) = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\mathrm{AMI}) P(\\mathrm{AMI})}{P(E)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the marginal probability of the exposure, calculated as:\n$$P(E) = P(E \\mid \\mathrm{AMI})P(\\mathrm{AMI}) + P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SFI})P(\\mathrm{SFI}) + P(E \\mid \\mathrm{Other})P(\\mathrm{Other})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(E) = (0.55)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.40) + (0.08)(0.30)$$\n$$P(E) = 0.165 + 0.040 + 0.024 = 0.229$$\nNow, we can calculate the posterior probability of $\\mathrm{AMI}$:\n$$P(\\mathrm{AMI} \\mid E) = \\frac{0.165}{0.229} \\approx 0.7205$$\nThe exposure history alone significantly shifts the probability of $\\mathrm{AMI}$. The pretest probability was $P(\\mathrm{AMI}) = 0.30$. After learning of the aquarium exposure, the posttest probability increases to $P(\\mathrm{AMI} \\mid E) \\approx 0.72$. This information alone makes $\\mathrm{AMI}$ the leading diagnosis, increasing its likelihood by a factor of approximately $2.4$.\n\n**Part 2: Final Posterior Probability $P(\\mathrm{AMI} \\mid E, C^{-}, A^{+})$**\n\nNow we incorporate all three pieces of evidence: $D = \\{E, C^{-}, A^{+}\\}$. We wish to compute $P(\\mathrm{AMI} \\mid E, C^{-}, A^{+})$.\nThe formula is:\n$$P(\\mathrm{AMI} \\mid E, C^{-}, A^{+}) = \\frac{P(E, C^{-}, A^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{AMI}) P(\\mathrm{AMI})}{P(E, C^{-}, A^{+})}$$\nThe problem states that $E$, $C^{-}$, and $A^{+}$ are conditionally independent given each etiologic category. This allows us to write the joint conditional probability (the likelihood) as the product of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$P(E, C^{-}, A^{+} \\mid H_i) = P(E \\mid H_i) P(C^{-} \\mid H_i) P(A^{+} \\mid H_i)$$\nThe denominator, the total probability of the evidence, is the sum of the likelihood-prior products over all hypotheses:\n$$P(E, C^{-}, A^{+}) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\mathrm{AMI, SFI, Other}\\}} P(E \\mid H_i) P(C^{-} \\mid H_i) P(A^{+} \\mid H_i) P(H_i)$$\n\nLet's compute the likelihood-prior product for each hypothesis. This corresponds to the numerator for the $\\mathrm{AMI}$ case and the other terms in the denominator's summation.\n\n1.  For $\\mathrm{AMI}$:\n    $$P(E, C^{-}, A^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{AMI}) P(\\mathrm{AMI}) = (P(E \\mid \\mathrm{AMI}) P(C^{-} \\mid \\mathrm{AMI}) P(A^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{AMI})) P(\\mathrm{AMI})$$\n    $$= (0.55 \\times 0.97 \\times 0.72) \\times 0.30$$\n    $$= 0.38412 \\times 0.30 = 0.115236$$\n\n2.  For $\\mathrm{SFI}$:\n    $$P(E, C^{-}, A^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{SFI}) P(\\mathrm{SFI}) = (P(E \\mid \\mathrm{SFI}) P(C^{-} \\mid \\mathrm{SFI}) P(A^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{SFI})) P(\\mathrm{SFI})$$\n    $$= (0.10 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.02) \\times 0.40$$\n    $$= 0.00024 \\times 0.40 = 0.000096$$\n\n3.

Our next step is to determine the ratio $\\frac{CL_{\\text{adj}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}}}$.\n\nTotal clearance ($CL$) is the sum of renal clearance ($CL_r$) and nonrenal clearance ($CL_{nr}$):\n$$ CL = CL_r + CL_{nr} $$\nFor the reference patient with normal renal function, the total clearance is $CL_{\\text{ref}} = CL_{r,\\text{ref}} + CL_{nr,\\text{ref}}$.\nFor ethambutol, the fraction of total clearance that is renal in a person with normal function is given as $f_r = 0.80$. Thus, we can express the components of reference clearance in terms of $CL_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$ CL_{r,\\text{ref}} = f_r \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}} $$\n$$ CL_{nr,\\text{ref}} = (1 - f_r) \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}} $$\nNow, we formulate the clearance for the patient with renal impairment, $CL_{\\text{adj}}$.\n$$ CL_{\\text{adj}} = CL_{r,\\text{adj}} + CL_{nr,\\text{adj}} $$\nThe problem states that nonrenal clearance is unchanged by renal dysfunction, so $CL_{nr,\\text{adj}} = CL_{nr,\\text{ref}}$.\nIt also states that renal clearance scales in proportion to creatinine clearance (CrCl). We define a scaling factor $\\theta$ as the ratio of the patient's CrCl to the reference CrCl:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{reference}}} $$\nTherefore, the patient's renal clearance is:\n$$ CL_{r,\\text{adj}} = CL_{r,\\text{ref}} \\cdot \\theta $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $CL_{r,\\text{ref}}$ and $CL_{nr,\\text{ref}}$ into the equation for $CL_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$ CL_{\\text{adj}} = (f_r \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}}) \\cdot \\theta + (1 - f_r) \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}} $$\nFactoring out $CL_{\\text{ref}}$ yields:\n$$ CL_{\\text{adj}} = CL_{\\text{ref}} \\cdot [f_r \\cdot \\theta + (1 - f_r)] $$\nNow we can compute the required clearance ratio:\n$$ \\frac{CL_{\\text{adj}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}}} = f_r \\cdot \\theta + (1 - f_r) $$\nThis ratio represents the patient's remaining total drug clearance as a fraction of normal clearance.\n\nLet's calculate the numerical values.\nThe reference dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}}$, is based on the patient's weight. The standard regimen is $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ and the patient's weight is $62\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 62\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 930\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe renal function scaling factor, $\\theta$, is calculated from the given CrCl values:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}} = 0.25 $$\nThe fraction of renal elimination, $f_r$, is given as $0.80$.\n\nWe can now calculate the clearance ratio:\n$$ \\frac{CL_{\\text{adj}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}}} = (0.80 \\cdot 0.25) + (1 - 0.80) = 0.20 + 0.20 = 0.40 $$\nThis means the patient's total ethambutol clearance is $40\\%$ of a person with normal renal function.\n\nFinally, we calculate the adjusted dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}} = \\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\text{adj}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}}} $$\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}} = 930\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times 0.40 = 372\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $372$ already has three significant figures.\nThe adjusted once-daily dose for this patient is $372\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{372}\n$$", "id": "4414502"}]}
