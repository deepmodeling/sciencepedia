Let $D$ be the event that the infection is due to methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA), and let $T$ be the event of a positive test result, which in this case is an ultrasound-confirmed abscess.\n\nThe given information is:\n1.  The pre-test probability of MRSA, $P(D) = 0.30$.\n2.  The positive likelihood ratio for an ultrasound-confirmed abscess, $LR+ = 6.0$.\n\nThe goal is to compute the post-test probability of MRSA, $P(D|T)$.\n\nThe relationship between probability ($p$) and odds ($O$) is given by the formulas:\n$$O = \\frac{p}{1-p} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p = \\frac{O}{1+O}$$\n\nFirst, we convert the pre-test probability to pre-test odds. The pre-test probability is $P(D) = 0.30$, which can be expressed as the fraction $\\frac{3}{10}$.\nThe pre-test odds, denoted as $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$, are calculated as:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.30}{1 - 0.30} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nNext, we use the likelihood ratio to update the pre-test odds to post-test odds.

The subject (MRSA skin infections), interventions (I&D, antibiotics), and outcome measures (recurrence rates) are standard in dermatology and infectious diseases.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the expected number of patients who need to receive an intervention instead of the control for one additional adverse outcome to be prevented. We will derive this from the principles of probability and expectation.\n\nLet $X$ be a Bernoulli random variable representing the outcome for a single patient, where $X=1$ if a recurrence occurs and $X=0$ if no recurrence occurs within the 3-month period.\n\nFor a patient in the control group (I&D alone), the probability of recurrence is given as $p_C = 0.20$. The expected number of recurrences for a single patient in the control group is the expectation of this random variable:\n$$E[X_{\\text{control}}] = 1 \\cdot P(X=1 | \\text{control}) + 0 \\cdot P(X=0 | \\text{control}) = P(X=1 | \\text{control}) = p_C$$\nSo, $E[X_{\\text{control}}] = 0.20$.\n\nFor a patient in the treatment group (I&D plus antibiotics), the probability of recurrence is given as $p_T = 0.12$. The expected number of recurrences for a single patient in the treatment group is:\n$$E[X_{\\text{treatment}}] = 1 \\cdot P(X=1 | \\text{treatment}) + 0 \\cdot P(X=0 | \\text{treatment}) = P(X=1 | \\text{treatment}) = p_T$$\nSo, $E[X_{\\text{treatment}}] = 0.12$.\n\nThe reduction in the expected number of recurrences for a single patient who receives the treatment instead of the control is the difference in these expectations. This difference represents the average number of recurrences prevented per patient treated. This quantity is known as the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\n$$\\text{ARR} = E[X_{\\text{control}}] - E[X_{\\text{treatment}}] = p_C - p_T$$\n\nWe are looking for the number of patients, $N$, that need to be treated to prevent one recurrence on average. This means the total expected number of prevented recurrences across these $N$ patients must equal $1$.\n\nGiven the assumption of independent outcomes and the linearity of expectation, the total expected number of recurrences prevented by treating a group of $N$ patients with the intervention is $N$ times the number of recurrences prevented per patient:\n$$\\text{Total Expected Prevented Recurrences} = N \\times (E[X_{\\text{control}}] - E[X_{\\text{treatment}}]) = N(p_C - p_T)$$\n\nTo find the NNT, we set the total expected number of prevented recurrences to $1$ and solve for $N$:\n$$1 = \\text{NNT} \\cdot (p_C - p_T)$$\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{p_C - p_T}$$\n\nThis derivation from first principles yields the standard formula for NNT. Now, we substitute the given values into this expression.\n$$p_C = 0.20$$\n$$p_T = 0.12$$\n\nThe absolute risk reduction is:\n$$\\text{ARR} = 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.08$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat is the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.08}$$\n\nTo provide an exact value, we convert the decimal to a fraction:\n$$0.08 = \\frac{8}{100} = \\frac{2}{25}$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for NNT:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{25}} = \\frac{25}{2} = 12.5$$\n\nThus, on average, $12.5$ patients with MRSA skin abscesses must be treated with I&D plus antibiotics (as opposed to I&D alone) to prevent one clinical recurrence over a 3-month period.

Categorical Agreement (CA) Rate**\nCategorical agreement is defined as the event where the automated method and the reference method yield the same category. This corresponds to the outcomes $(S, S)$, $(I, I)$, and $(R, R)$. The total number of isolates in categorical agreement, $N_{CA}$, is the sum of the diagonal entries in the contingency table of outcomes.\n$$N_{CA} = N_{SS} + N_{II} + N_{RR}$$\nThe categorical agreement rate, $R_{CA}$, is the fraction of all tested isolates that are in categorical agreement. The appropriate denominator is the total number of isolates, $N_{total}$.\n$$R_{CA} = \\frac{N_{CA}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{N_{SS} + N_{II} + N_{RR}}{N_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{CA} = 125 + 15 + 66 = 206$$\n$$R_{CA} = \\frac{206}{220} \\approx 0.936363...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R_{CA} = 0.9364$.\n\n**2.

The number of isolates exhibiting a major error is:\n$$N_{ME} = N_{SR} = 3$$\nThe rate of major errors is calculated with respect to the population of isolates for which this specific error is possible. A major error is a false-resistance finding. This is only meaningful for isolates that are truly susceptible according to the reference standard. Therefore, the appropriate denominator is the total number of isolates determined to be susceptible by the reference method, denoted as $N_{S,ref}$.\n$$N_{S,ref} = N_{SS} + N_{SI} + N_{SR} = 125 + 2 + 3 = 130$$\nThe major error rate, $R_{ME}$, is thus:\n$$R_{ME} = \\frac{N_{ME}}{N_{S,ref}} = \\frac{N_{SR}}{N_{SS} + N_{SI} + N_{SR}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R_{ME} = \\frac{3}{130} \\approx 0.0230769...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R_{ME} = 0.02308$.\n\n**3. Very Major Error (VME) Rate**\nA very major error is defined as an isolate reported as susceptible by the automated method but resistant by the reference method. This corresponds to the outcome $(R, S)$. The number of isolates exhibiting a very major error is:\n$$N_{VME} = N_{RS} = 1$$\nA very major error is a false-susceptibility finding, which carries significant clinical risk (potential treatment failure). This error is only possible for isolates that are truly resistant according to the reference standard. Consequently, the appropriate denominator is the total number of isolates determined to be resistant by the reference method, denoted as $N_{R,ref}$.\n$$N_{R,ref} = N_{RS} + N_{RI} + N_{RR} = 1 + 3 + 66 = 70$$\nThe very major error rate, $R_{VME}$, is thus:\n$$R_{VME} = \\frac{N_{VME}}{N_{R,ref}} = \\frac{N_{RS}}{N_{RS} + N_{RI} + N_{RR}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R_{VME} = \\frac{1}{70} \\approx 0.0142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R_{VME} = 0.01429$.\n\nIn summary, the derived expressions and computed values are:\n- Categorical Agreement Rate: $R_{CA} = \\frac{N_{SS} + N_{II} + N_{RR}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{206}{220} \\approx 0.9364$\n- Major Error Rate: $R_{ME} = \\frac{N_{SR}}{N_{S,ref}} = \\frac{3}{130} \\approx 0.02308$\n- Very Major Error Rate: $R_{VME} = \\frac{N_{RS}}{N_{R,ref}} = \\frac{1}{70} \\approx 0.01429$\n\nThe final results are reported in the requested order: categorical agreement, major error, very major error.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9364 & 0.02308 & 0.01429 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4460898"}]}
