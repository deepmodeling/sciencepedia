This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem for updating a belief (the pretest probability) in light of new evidence (the test result).\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that the child has tinea capitis (the disease is present).\n- $D^c$: The event that the child does not have tinea capitis (the disease is absent).\n- $T^+$: The event that the KOH test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the KOH test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n1.  The pretest probability of tinea capitis:\n    $$P(D) = 0.6$$\n2.  The sensitivity of the KOH test, which is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present:\n    $$P(T^+ | D) = 0.8$$\n3.  The specificity of the KOH test, which is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent:\n    $$P(T^- | D^c) = 0.9$$\n\nFrom these given values, we can deduce other necessary probabilities. The probability of not having the disease is the complement of having the disease:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$\n\nAlso, the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of having tinea capitis given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$. Bayes' theorem provides the formal relationship for this calculation:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the disease status:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the known values into this expression:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.8)(0.6) + (0.1)(0.4)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.48 + 0.04$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.52$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.8)(0.6)}{0.52} = \\frac{0.48}{0.52}$$\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can express it with integers:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{48}{52} = \\frac{12 \\times 4}{13 \\times 4} = \\frac{12}{13}$$\n\nFinally, we must convert this fraction to a decimal and round to $4$ significant figures as requested.\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{12}{13} \\approx 0.92307692...$$\n\nRounding this value to $4$ significant figures, we examine the fifth significant digit.

The fifth digit is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit ($0$) to $1$.\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.9231$$\n\nThis is the post-test probability that the child has tinea capitis given the positive KOH test result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9231}$$", "id": "4435330"}, {"introduction": "While quantitative tools are powerful, real-world clinical practice often presents complex scenarios with conflicting data.

Its validity is assessed as follows:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is unequivocally grounded in medical science. The clinical triad of scalp scaling/hair loss, occipital lymphadenopathy, and specific trichoscopic findings (comma/corkscrew hairs) is a classic presentation of tinea capitis. The diagnostic methods described—KOH preparation, fungal culture on Sabouraud agar—are standard procedures in mycology. The observed finding of an 'ectothrix' pattern of hair invasion is a well-described mycological phenomenon. The discordance between direct microscopy (KOH) and culture is a frequently encountered clinical problem, often related to factors like prior antifungal treatment or sampling technique, which are included in the problem. The entire scenario is scientifically and medically realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient clinical and laboratory data to allow for a reasoned differential diagnosis and management plan. The central conflict (positive KOH vs. negative culture) is clearly defined, and the question asks for the most logical resolution based on established principles. A single best answer can be derived.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical language. It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent clinical picture. It represents a valid and standard problem in clinical reasoning. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe diagnosis of tinea capitis rests on a combination of clinical suspicion and mycological confirmation.\n1.  **Clinical Evidence**: The patient is a $7$-year-old child, a typical demographic for tinea capitis. The presentation of pruritic, scaly patches with broken hairs ('black dots' or alopecic patches) is highly characteristic. The presence of occipital lymphadenopathy is a very common associated sign, resulting from the inflammatory response to the fungal antigens.\n2.  **Trichoscopic Evidence**: The finding of comma hairs and corkscrew hairs is considered highly specific for tinea capitis, particularly caused by *Trichophyton* species. These findings represent hair shafts that are fractured and filled with fungal elements.\n3.  **Microscopic Evidence (KOH Preparation)**: The KOH preparation provides direct, visual confirmation of a fungal infection. The test involves dissolving keratin with potassium hydroxide to make fungal elements visible. A positive result, showing arthroconidia on the hair shaft (an ectothrix pattern), is direct evidence of dermatophyte invasion of the hair. Specificity of a properly interpreted KOH prep is high. This test detects fungal structures, irrespective of whether the organisms are viable.\n4.  **Culture Evidence (Fungal Culture)**: Fungal culture is used to grow the organism, allowing for definitive species identification. This is important for epidemiological tracking and can sometimes guide the duration of therapy. However, culture has a notable limitation: it requires **viable** fungal elements. The sensitivity of fungal culture for tinea capitis is not $100\\%$ and is reported to be in the range of $70\\%-90\\%$ even under ideal conditions.\n\n**Analysis of the Discordant Result (Positive KOH, Negative Culture):**\nThe presented case shows strong clinical, trichoscopic, and microscopic evidence for tinea capitis. The negative culture result must be interpreted in this context. There are two primary, well-established reasons for a false-negative culture in this scenario:\n1.  **Reduced Organism Viability**: The problem explicitly states the patient had been using topical terbinafine (a fungicidal agent) and ketoconazole (a fungistatic agent) for $7$ days. This antifungal treatment, even if only topical, can suppress fungal growth or kill the organisms on the scalp surface and within the superficial portion of the hair follicles, rendering them non-viable. Non-viable fungi will not grow in culture, leading to a false-negative result, even though their structural components (hyphae, arthroconidia) persist and remain visible on KOH preparation.\n2.  **Suboptimal Sampling Technique**: The sample for culture was obtained using a cotton swab from the scaly surface. Tinea capitis is an infection of the hair shaft (an endo- or ectothrix). The highest yield of viable organisms comes from the infected material itself—the stubs of broken hairs and a deep scrape of the scale. A simple surface swab may not collect a sufficient quantity of viable fungal elements. More effective methods include using a sterile toothbrush or cytobrush to vigorously sample the area, or plucking affected hairs for inoculation.\n\n**Conclusion and Next Steps:**\nThe overwhelming weight of evidence points to a diagnosis of tinea capitis. The negative culture is best explained as a false negative due to prior antifungal use and possibly a suboptimal sampling method. It does not invalidate the diagnosis.\nGiven the diagnosis, the standard of care for tinea capitis is **systemic** antifungal therapy. Topical treatments alone are insufficient because they do not adequately penetrate the hair follicle and shaft to eradicate the infection. Therefore, withholding treatment pending further tests is inappropriate. The child has an active infection and should be treated.\nIf species identification is critical (e.g., for public health or in a case of treatment failure), one could attempt to obtain a new sample. To maximize yield, this would ideally be done after discontinuing antifungals for a \"washout\" period (e.g., $1-2$ weeks) and using a superior collection technique (e.g., toothbrush method). An alternative, and increasingly used, method is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR detects fungal DNA, is more sensitive than culture, and does not require viable organisms, making it an excellent choice in cases of prior treatment.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The negative culture rules out dermatophytosis; the positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) is most likely contamination. Discontinue antifungals and evaluate for alopecia areata.**\n- **Evaluation**: This interpretation is incorrect. The sensitivity of fungal culture is known to be imperfect, and a negative result does not rule out a diagnosis, especially in the setting of prior antifungal therapy. To dismiss the combination of a classic clinical picture, specific trichoscopy findings, and a positive KOH as \"contamination\" is medically unsound. The clinical features are inconsistent with typical alopecia areata, which presents as smooth, non-scaly patches.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Prior antifungal exposure and suboptimal sampling can reduce culture sensitivity by decreasing viable organisms and yield. A positive KOH demonstrating arthroconidia within or on hair shafts strongly supports tinea capitis; initiate systemic therapy and, if speciation is needed, repeat sampling after an antifungal washout using a higher-yield method (for example, hair-brush/toothbrush method) and consider polymerase chain reaction (PCR).**\n- **Evaluation**: This option provides a complete and accurate analysis. It correctly identifies prior treatment and sampling method as key factors that reduce culture sensitivity. It correctly prioritizes the strong positive clinical and microscopic evidence. It recommends the mandatory next step: initiation of systemic therapy. Finally, it outlines the appropriate, evidence-based strategies for obtaining speciation if required (washout with improved sampling, or PCR). This represents the highest standard of clinical reasoning.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Both KOH and culture must be positive to diagnose tinea capitis; therefore, repeat both tests while withholding therapy until concordant results are obtained.**\n- **Evaluation**: This is a rigid and clinically harmful approach. There is no absolute requirement for both tests to be positive; diagnosis is a clinical judgment based on all available evidence. Withholding treatment from a symptomatic child with an active infection, for which there is already strong microscopic evidence, is poor medical practice and may lead to worsening of the condition and increased transmission.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A negative culture indicates a nondermatophyte mold etiology that does not require systemic therapy; manage with topical ketoconazole shampoo alone.**\n- **Evaluation**: This makes an unsubstantiated leap in logic. A negative culture is far more likely to be a false negative for a dermatophyte than evidence for a nondermatophyte mold, especially given the classic clinical and trichoscopic picture. Furthermore, the assertion that it would not require systemic therapy is false; tinea capitis, regardless of etiology, requires systemic treatment. Topical shampoo is only an adjunctive therapy to decrease transmissibility and is not curative on its own.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4435417"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis is established, effective and safe treatment is paramount.

It is a sound, well-posed, and practical application of mathematical optimization to a clinical scenario. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**1.

Formulate the Average Daily Dose**\nNext, we express the average daily dose over the $N=7$-day cycle as a function of $x$. Let this be $D_{\\text{avg}}(x)$.\nThe total number of capsules administered over the $7$-day cycle is:\n$$C_{\\text{total}}(x) = x \\cdot n_2 + (7-x) \\cdot n_1 = x \\cdot 4 + (7-x) \\cdot 3 = 4x + 21 - 3x = x + 21$$\nThe total mass of griseofulvin administered during the cycle is the total number of capsules multiplied by the strength per capsule, $S$:\n$$M_{\\text{total}}(x) = C_{\\text{total}}(x) \\times S = (x+21) \\times 125\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe average daily dose is this total mass divided by the number of days in the cycle, $N=7$:\n$$D_{\\text{avg}}(x) = \\frac{M_{\\text{total}}(x)}{7} = \\frac{125(x+21)}{7}\\ \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{day}$$\n\n**3.

The candidates are $x=2$ and $x=3$. We evaluate the deviation $\\Delta(x)$ for each.\nFor $x=2$:\n$$\\Delta(2) = \\left|\\frac{125(2+21)}{7} - 420\\right| = \\left|\\frac{125 \\times 23}{7} - 420\\right| = \\left|\\frac{2875}{7} - \\frac{2940}{7}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{-65}{7}\\right| = \\frac{65}{7}$$\nFor $x=3$:\n$$\\Delta(3) = \\left|\\frac{125(3+21)}{7} - 420\\right| = \\left|\\frac{125 \\times 24}{7} - 420\\right| = \\left|\\frac{3000}{7} - \\frac{2940}{7}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{60}{7}\\right| = \\frac{60}{7}$$\nComparing the deviations, $\\frac{60}{7}  \\frac{65}{7}$.
