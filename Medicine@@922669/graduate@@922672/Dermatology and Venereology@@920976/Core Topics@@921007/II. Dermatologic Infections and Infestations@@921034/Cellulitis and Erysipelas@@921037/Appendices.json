Assume the following fundamental base:\n\n- By the definition of expected utility, the preferred action maximizes expected utility (equivalently, minimizes expected disutility), computed as the probability-weighted sum of utilities across mutually exclusive outcomes.\n- By the law of total probability, the expected disutility of each empiric choice can be decomposed by whether the etiologic organism is MRSA (with probability $p$) or non-MRSA (with probability $1-p$).\n\nModel the clinical course as follows.\n\n- If the etiologic organism is MRSA and the empiric regimen is beta-lactam alone, the probability of initial clinical success is $0.50$. If the empiric regimen includes an MRSA-active drug, the probability of initial clinical success is $0.90$.\n- If the etiologic organism is non-MRSA, the initial success probability is the same under both regimens, so any difference in expected utility arises only from MRSA cases and from adverse events of the added MRSA-active agent.\n- Assign a disutility of $0.020$ Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) for an initial clinical failure, reflecting additional morbidity and resource use.\n- The added MRSA-active drug has the following adverse events, each independent of etiology and of each other for this calculation:\n  - Clostridioides difficile infection with probability $0.020$ and disutility $0.10$ QALY.\n  - Gastrointestinal intolerance with probability $0.15$ and disutility $0.005$ QALY.\n  - Severe allergic reaction with probability $0.001$ and disutility $0.30$ QALY.\n\nTreat the disutility of initial clinical success as $0$, and assume any baseline disutility common to both regimens cancels in the comparison.

This problem utilizes a first-order kinetic model, a common simplification in pharmacology, to simulate the resolution of inflammation and infection over time. This quantitative approach allows you to model how patient-specific factors, such as lymphedema, can influence treatment response and inform a rational decision on therapy duration [@problem_id:4419109].", "problem": "A hospitalized adult with nonpurulent lower leg cellulitis, clinically consistent with beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, presents without systemic features of sepsis and without necrotizing soft tissue infection. The patient has mild chronic lymphedema of the affected limb but no abscess, no immunosuppression, and no bacteremia, consistent with uncomplicated cellulitis. Oral beta-lactam therapy is initiated at time $t=0$ with appropriate dosing and adherence.\n\nUse the following foundational and empirically supported assumptions grounded in clinical pharmacodynamics and inflammatory resolution:\n1. Under effective antimicrobial therapy, the dominant bacterial burden and the associated inflammatory response in uncomplicated cellulitis decrease approximately as first-order processes. If $x(t)$ denotes a measurable correlate of the process (for example, lesion area or C-reactive protein), then $\\frac{dx}{dt}=-k x$ with solution $x(t)=x_{0}\\exp(-k t)$, where $k$ is a positive rate constant and $x_{0}$ is the initial value.\n2. The clinically tracked erythema area $A(t)$ and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration $C(t)$ each follow $A(t)=A_{0}\\exp(-k_{A} t)$ and $C(t)=C_{0}\\exp(-k_{C} t)$ once appropriate antimicrobial therapy is initiated.\n3. In otherwise healthy adults with uncomplicated cellulitis, typical resolution rates correspond to half-lives on the order of days: take the baseline erythema-area half-life to be $2$ days, so $k_{A,0}=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{2}$ day$^{-1}$, and the baseline CRP half-life to be $1.5$ days, so $k_{C,0}=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.5}$ day$^{-1}$.\n4. Mild chronic lymphedema reduces effective tissue antibiotic penetration and lymphatic clearance, decreasing both rate constants multiplicatively by a factor $f=0.7$, so $k_{A,\\mathrm{eff}}=f\\,k_{A,0}$ and $k_{C,\\mathrm{eff}}=f\\,k_{C,0}$.\n5. A clinically acceptable stopping point for therapy in uncomplicated cellulitis is when both erythema and systemic inflammatory activity have substantially resolved.
