It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, specifically the evaluation of diagnostic tests. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that a patient has pityriasis versicolor (PV), and $\\neg D$ be the event that the patient does not have PV. Let $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive Wood's lamp test and $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative test. The true disease state is denoted by $Y$, which can be either $D$ or $\\neg D$. The diagnosis based on the test is denoted by $\\hat{Y}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions and values:\n-   Prevalence: $P(D) = p = 0.30$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n-   Sensitivity: $P(T^{+} \\mid D) = \\mathrm{Se} = 0.40$.\n-   Specificity: $P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) = \\mathrm{Sp} = 0.90$.\n\nThe decision rule is that a patient is diagnosed as having PV if and only if the test is positive:\n-   If $T^{+}$, then $\\hat{Y} = D$.\n-   If $T^{-}$, then $\\hat{Y} = \\neg D$.\n\nWe are asked to find the expected misclassification rate, which is the probability $P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y)$. A misclassification occurs in two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n1.  A patient with the disease is diagnosed as not having it (a false negative).\n2.  A patient without the disease is diagnosed as having it (a false positive).\n\nWe can formulate the total probability of misclassification using the Law of Total Probability, conditioning on the true disease state $Y$:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=D)P(D) + P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=\\neg D)P(\\neg D)$$\n\nLet's analyze each term in this expression.\n\nThe first term, $P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=D)$, is the probability of misclassification given the patient has the disease. A misclassification in this case means the patient is diagnosed as not having PV, i.e., $\\hat{Y} = \\neg D$. According to the decision rule, $\\hat{Y} = \\neg D$ occurs if the test is negative, $T^{-}$. Therefore:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=D) = P(T^{-} \\mid D)$$\nThis is the False Negative Rate (FNR). The probability of a negative test given the disease is the complement of the probability of a positive test given the disease (the sensitivity):\n$$P(T^{-} \\mid D) = 1 - P(T^{+} \\mid D) = 1 - \\mathrm{Se}$$\n\nThe second term, $P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=\\neg D)$, is the probability of misclassification given the patient does not have the disease. A misclassification here means the patient is diagnosed as having PV, i.e., $\\hat{Y} = D$. According to the decision rule, $\\hat{Y} = D$ occurs if the test is positive, $T^{+}$. Therefore:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=\\neg D) = P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)$$\nThis is the False Positive Rate (FPR). The probability of a positive test given no disease is the complement of the probability of a negative test given no disease (the specificity):\n$$P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$$\n\nSubstituting these results back into the Law of Total Probability expression:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = (1 - \\mathrm{Se}) P(D) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) P(\\neg D)$$\nUsing the given symbols for prevalence, we get the general expression for the misclassification rate:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = (1 - \\mathrm{Se})p + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $p = 0.30$, $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.40$, and $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.90$.\nThe probability of a false negative for a diseased individual is $1 - \\mathrm{Se} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\nThe probability of a false positive for a non-diseased individual is $1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\nThe prevalence of the disease is $p = 0.30$, and the prevalence of non-disease is $1-p = 0.70$.\n\nSubstituting these into our derived formula:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = (0.60)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.70)$$\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = 0.18 + 0.07$$\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = 0.25$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $0.25$ becomes $0.2500$.\nThe expected misclassification rate is the sum of the probability of all false negatives in the population ($0.18$) and the probability of all false positives in the population ($0.07$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2500}$$", "id": "4481305"}, {"introduction": "The results of clinical trials are frequently presented using statistical measures like the odds ratio ($OR$), which quantifies the strength of association between an intervention and an outcome.

It describes a standard randomized controlled trial (RCT) structure. Pityriasis versicolor, its diagnosis via KOH mount, and treatment with selenium sulfide are all well-established in dermatology.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) from foundational principles. Let us define the variables provided.\nLet $P_t$ be the probability of a beneficial outcome (cure) in the treatment group. From the problem statement, $P_t = 0.75$.\nLet $P_c$ be the probability of a beneficial outcome (cure) in the control group. From the problem statement, $P_c = 0.50$.\n\nThe first principle is the concept of a beneficial outcome attributable to the treatment. The treatment provides an additional benefit over the control. The magnitude of this additional benefit per patient is the difference in the probabilities of the outcome between the two groups. This is known as the Absolute Risk Difference (ARD) or, in this case of a positive outcome, the Absolute Benefit Increase.\n\nThe Absolute Risk Difference is defined as:\n$$ARD = |P_t - P_c|$$\nFor a beneficial outcome where $P_t > P_c$, this simplifies to:\n$$ARD = P_t - P_c$$\nThis value represents the excess proportion of patients who experience the beneficial outcome in the treatment group compared to the control group. For instance, if we treat $100$ patients with the active intervention and $100$ patients with the control, we expect $(100 \\times P_t) - (100 \\times P_c) = 100 \\times (P_t - P_c) = 100 \\times ARD$ additional cures in the treatment group.\n\nThe second principle is the operational meaning of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is defined as the average number of patients who must be treated with the specific intervention to achieve one additional beneficial outcome that would not have occurred in the control group.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of patients we treat. The number of additional cures we achieve by treating these $N$ patients is $N \\times ARD$. We are looking for the value of $N$ that makes this number of additional cures equal to $1$.\n$$N \\times ARD = 1$$\nSolving for $N$, which is the NNT, we get:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARD}$$\nSubstituting the expression for ARD, we derive the formula for NNT from first principles:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{P_t - P_c}$$\nThis expression is valid only when $P_t > P_c$, which is the case here. If $P_t \\le P_c$, the concept of NNT for benefit is not meaningful, and one would calculate the number needed to harm (NNH).\n\nNow, we compute the value of NNT using the data provided in the problem.\nGiven:\n$P_t = 0.75$\n$P_c = 0.50$\n\nFirst, calculate the Absolute Risk Difference (ARD):\n$$ARD = P_t - P_c = 0.75 - 0.50 = 0.25$$\nThis means that for every patient treated with selenium sulfide shampoo, there is a $0.25$ or $25\\%$ greater chance of cure compared to the vehicle control.\n\nNext, we use the derived formula for NNT:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARD} = \\frac{1}{0.25}$$\nSince $0.25$ is equivalent to the fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$, the calculation is:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 4$$\nThe resulting NNT is a dimensionless number. Operationally, this means that, on average, $4$ patients with pityriasis versicolor must be treated with selenium sulfide shampoo for two weeks to achieve one additional cure that would not have happened if they had been treated with the vehicle control.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "4481454"}]}
