It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find the value of the position $r$ within the domain $[0, L]$ that maximizes the lesion initiation propensity, $\\lambda(r)$.\n\nThe lesion initiation propensity is given by the relation:\n$$ \\lambda(r) \\propto r_{\\mathrm{max}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(T(r)-T_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\right)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) $$\nLet $C$ be the constant of proportionality, such that $C > 0$. Then $\\lambda(r)$ can be written as:\n$$ \\lambda(r) = C \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{max}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(T(r)-T_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\right)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) $$\nSince $C$ and $r_{\\mathrm{max}}$ are positive constants, maximizing $\\lambda(r)$ is equivalent to maximizing the exponential function term. The function $\\exp(x)$ is a strictly monotonic increasing function of its argument $x$. Therefore, maximizing $\\lambda(r)$ is equivalent to maximizing its argument:\n$$ -\\frac{\\left(T(r)-T_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\right)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} $$\nSince $-1/(2\\sigma^2)$ is a negative constant, maximizing this expression is equivalent to minimizing the term:\n$$ \\left(T(r)-T_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\right)^{2} $$\nThis term is a squared real number, which is always non-negative. Its minimum possible value is $0$. This minimum is achieved if and only if the expression inside the square is zero, that is:\n$$ T(r) - T_{\\mathrm{opt}} = 0 \\implies T(r) = T_{\\mathrm{opt}} $$\nThus, the propensity $\\lambda(r)$ is maximized at the position $r^{\\ast}$ where the local temperature $T(r^{\\ast})$ is equal to the optimal temperature $T_{\\mathrm{opt}}$.\n\nWe must first verify that such a temperature is reached within the physical domain of the limb, i.e., for some $r \\in [0, L]$. The temperature range along the limb is from $T(0) = T_{\\mathrm{prox}} = 34\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $T(L) = T_{\\mathrm{dist}} = 28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The optimal temperature is $T_{\\mathrm{opt}} = 30.5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Since $T_{\\mathrm{dist}} \\le T_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\le T_{\\mathrm{prox}}$ (specifically, $28 \\le 30.5 \\le 34$), there exists a unique point $r^{\\ast} \\in [0, L]$ where $T(r^{\\ast}) = T_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, because $T(r)$ is a continuous and monotonic function of $r$.\n\nWe can find this position $r^{\\ast}$ by substituting the expression for $T(r)$ into the optimality condition $T(r) = T_{\\mathrm{opt}}$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{prox}}-\\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{prox}}-T_{\\mathrm{dist}}}{L}\\right)r^{\\ast} = T_{\\mathrm{opt}} $$\nNow, we solve for $r^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{prox}}-T_{\\mathrm{dist}}}{L}\\right)r^{\\ast} = T_{\\mathrm{prox}} - T_{\\mathrm{opt}} $$\n$$ r^{\\ast} = L \\left( \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{prox}} - T_{\\mathrm{opt}}}{T_{\\mathrm{prox}} - T_{\\mathrm{dist}}} \\right) $$\nThis expression gives the location of maximum lesion propensity. To confirm this is a maximum without recourse to the monotonicity argument, one could compute the derivatives of $\\lambda(r)$, but the logic presented is sufficient and sound.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression for $r^{\\ast}$:\n- $L=70\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{prox}}=34\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{dist}}=28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{opt}}=30.5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ r^{\\ast} = 70 \\left( \\frac{34 - 30.5}{34 - 28} \\right) $$\n$$ r^{\\ast} = 70 \\left( \\frac{3.5}{6} \\right) $$\n$$ r^{\\ast} = 70 \\left( \\frac{7/2}{6} \\right) = 70 \\left( \\frac{7}{12} \\right) $$\n$$ r^{\\ast} = \\frac{490}{12} = \\frac{245}{6} $$\n$$ r^{\\ast} = 40.8333... \\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ r^{\\ast} \\approx 40.8\\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\nThis is the distance from the proximal point ($r=0$) at which the lesion initiation propensity is maximized.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{40.8}$$", "id": "4441609"}, {"introduction": "Modern dermatology increasingly relies on non-invasive optical techniques for diagnosing and monitoring cutaneous conditions.

All necessary data are provided, the units are consistent after appropriate conversions, and the physical principles (Beer-Lambert law, fluorescence quantum yield) are fundamental. The problem asks for the derivation of a sensitivity coefficient in a realistic biophotonics scenario.\n\nThe derivation of the sensitivity coefficient $\\alpha$ proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we establish the rate of excitation photons incident on the skin patch. The excitation irradiance is $I_{\\mathrm{exc}}$ over an area $A$. The total excitation power is $P_{\\mathrm{exc}} = I_{\\mathrm{exc}} A$. The energy of a single photon at wavelength $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{exc}}$ is given by the Planck-Einstein relation, $E_{\\mathrm{exc}} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{exc}}}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. The rate of incident photons, $N_{\\mathrm{inc}}$, is the total power divided by the energy per photon:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{inc}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{exc}}}{E_{\\mathrm{exc}}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{exc}} A \\lambda_{\\mathrm{exc}}}{hc}$$\n\nNext, we determine the rate of photons absorbed by the porphyrin in the illuminated volume. The Beer-Lambert law describes the attenuation of light through an absorbing medium: $T_{BL} = 10^{-A_{bs}}$, where $T_{BL}$ is the transmittance and $A_{bs}$ is the absorbance. The absorbance is given by $A_{bs} = \\varepsilon C l$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, $C$ is the molar concentration of the absorber, and $l$ is the path length.\n\nThe fraction of photons absorbed is $F_{abs} = 1 - T_{BL} = 1 - 10^{-\\varepsilon C l}$. The problem specifies the low-absorbance regime, which corresponds to early colonization and thus a small concentration $C$. For a small argument $x = \\varepsilon C l$, we can use the approximation $10^{-x} = \\exp(-x\\ln(10)) \\approx 1 - x\\ln(10)$. Therefore, the fraction of absorbed photons is:\n$$F_{abs} \\approx \\varepsilon C l \\ln(10)$$\n\nThe rate of absorbed photons, $N_{\\mathrm{abs}}$, is the rate of incident photons multiplied by the fraction absorbed:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{abs}} = N_{\\mathrm{inc}} F_{abs} \\approx \\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{exc}} A \\lambda_{\\mathrm{exc}}}{hc}\\right) (\\varepsilon C l \\ln(10))$$\n\nNow we relate the concentration $C$ to the bacterial load $B$. Let $B$ be the number of colony-forming units (CFU) in the illuminated area $A$. Each bacterium contributes $k_p$ moles of porphyrin. The total number of moles of porphyrin is $n_p = B k_p$. The porphyrin is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the illuminated volume $V = A l$. The molar absorptivity $\\varepsilon$ is given in units of $\\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which requires the concentration $C$ to be in molarity ($\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$) and the path length $l$ to be in $\\mathrm{cm}$.

Thus, we can set $[D] = C$.\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[T]C}{[TD]} $$\nThe total number of target molecules per cell is $N$. As the problem's quantities are given in numbers of molecules per cell, we can work with molecule counts instead of concentrations, since the volume is a common factor that cancels in ratios.

The threshold $N_{\\text{crit}}$ is a property of the bacterium's essential physiology and is stated to be independent of the drug, so it remains unchanged for the variant.\n\nFor the variant strain:\nThe total target copy number is doubled:\n$$ N_{\\text{variant}} = 2 \\times N_0 = 2 \\times 10^4 $$\nThe dissociation constant is doubled:\n$$ K_{d, \\text{variant}} = 2 \\times K_{d,0} = 2 \\times (10 \\text{ nM}) = 20 \\text{ nM} $$\nThe critical threshold remains the same:\n$$ N_{\\text{crit}} = 2 \\times 10^3 $$\nNow, we substitute these values for the variant strain into the derived expression for MIC:\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = K_{d, \\text{variant}} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{variant}}}{N_{\\text{crit}}} - 1\\right) $$\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = (20 \\text{ nM}) \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^4}{2 \\times 10^3} - 1\\right) $$\nFirst, evaluate the ratio within the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{2 \\times 10^4}{2 \\times 10^3} = \\frac{2}{2} \\times 10^{(4-3)} = 1 \\times 10^1 = 10 $$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}}$:\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = (20 \\text{ nM}) (10 - 1) $$\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = (20 \\text{ nM}) (9) $$\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = 180 \\text{ nM} $$\nThe new MIC for the variant strain is $180$ nM. The problem requests the final answer as a single number without units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{180}$$", "id": "4441629"}]}
