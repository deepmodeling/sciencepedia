{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in effective management is an accurate diagnosis, and on the plantar surface, warts can be notoriously difficult to distinguish from their common mimics like corns (clavi). A correct diagnosis relies not on a single finding but on the skillful integration of patient history, specific physical examination maneuvers, and an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. This first exercise guides you through this process of clinical reasoning, challenging you to use key diagnostic clues to differentiate between a viral lesion and a biomechanical one, and to predict the findings that would confirm your diagnosis upon paring [@problem_id:4421419].", "problem": "A patient aged $32$ years, who is a long-distance runner, presents with one principal lesion on the heel measuring approximately $8$ to $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter, surrounded by rim callus. On examination of the painful lesion, lateral compression (the so-called \"pinch test\") does not increase pain, but direct vertical pressure from above elicits focal tenderness. There is no maceration, and the lesion is centrally indented. The clinician considers the differential between a plantar verruca (wart) and a corn (clavus), planning to confirm by careful scalpel paring.\n\nStarting from first principles relevant to this context:\n- A plantar verruca arises from infection by Human Papillomavirus (HPV), with the virus infecting basal keratinocytes and producing endophytic papillary hyperplasia that interrupts normal dermatoglyphics (skin lines) and supports a vascular axis with capillary loops. Upon paring, these capillary loops often manifest as thrombosed vessels (\"black dots\") and can bleed punctately.\n- A corn (clavus) is a biomechanical hyperkeratotic response to chronic focal pressure and friction over bony prominences; it contains a conical keratinous nucleus oriented inward, with overlying dermatoglyphics typically preserved. Pain is classically accentuated by direct perpendicular pressure due to the central core impinging on the dermis.\n- Considering pressure as a basic physical variable, pressure satisfies $P = F/A$, where $F$ is force applied and $A$ is the area over which the force is distributed. Direct vertical pressure increases $P$ over the small contact area of a corn’s central nucleus, while lateral compression predominantly applies shear rather than increasing $P$ over the nucleus.\n\nWhich option best integrates this reasoning to distinguish the lesion and outlines the most likely paring findings that would confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Plantar verruca (wart); paring reveals multiple punctate hemorrhages (\"black dots\"), interruption of skin lines, and broadened papillary projections often coalescing into a mosaic pattern.\n\nB.

Plantar verruca (wart); paring reveals preservation of dermatoglyphics and a central translucent core; the pinch test is negative because warts are deeper than corns.\n\nD. Corn (clavus); paring reveals disruption of skin lines with papillary bleeding; the pinch test is typically more painful than direct pressure in corns.\n\nE. Intractable plantar keratosis (callus); paring reveals black dots and interrupted lines indicating mechanical hyperkeratosis; pinch test findings are non-specific and therefore diagnosis cannot be made by paring.", "solution": "The problem statement is a clinical scenario requiring differential diagnosis between a plantar verruca and a corn (clavus) based on patient history, physical examination findings, and fundamental pathophysiological and physical principles.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient: age $32$ years, long-distance runner.\n- Lesion: one principal lesion on the heel, diameter approximately $8$ to $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, surrounded by rim callus.\n- Pain Examination:\n    - Lateral compression (\"pinch test\") does not increase pain.\n    - Direct vertical pressure from above elicits focal tenderness.\n- Lesion Appearance: no maceration, centrally indented.\n- Differential Diagnoses: Plantar verruca (wart) vs. Corn (clavus).\n- First Principles:\n    1.  **Plantar verruca:** Caused by HPV, results in endophytic papillary hyperplasia, interruption of dermatoglyphics, and a vascular axis with capillary loops. Paring shows thrombosed vessels (\"black dots\") and punctate bleeding.\n    2.  **Corn (clavus):** A biomechanical hyperkeratotic response to pressure/friction. It has a conical keratinous nucleus oriented inward, with dermatoglyphics typically preserved. Pain is accentuated by direct perpendicular pressure.\n    3.  **Pressure Physics:** $P = F/A$. Direct vertical pressure increases $P$ over a corn's central nucleus.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of dermatology and biomechanics. The descriptions of plantar verrucae and clavi (corns), including their etiology, histology, and clinical features, are factually accurate and consistent with standard medical literature. The application of the physical principle of pressure ($P = F/A$) to explain the pain mechanism is appropriate and correct.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear clinical scenario with specific findings and asks for a logical deduction based on provided principles.

Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to integrate the clinical findings with the provided first principles to identify the most likely diagnosis and the expected findings upon paring the lesion.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Clinical Findings:**\n    -   **Patient Profile:** A long-distance runner is subjected to chronic, repetitive pressure and friction on weight-bearing areas of the feet, such as the heel. This history is a strong predisposing factor for biomechanical hyperkeratotic lesions like corns.\n    -   **Pain Profile:** The pain characteristics are the most crucial diagnostic clue.\n        -   The absence of pain on lateral compression (negative \"pinch test\") argues strongly against a plantar verruca. As per the first principles, a verruca consists of papillary structures supported by a vascular axis. Squeezing these structures together from the sides typically elicits sharp pain.\n        -   The presence of focal tenderness on direct vertical pressure is the classic sign of a corn (clavus). The provided physics principle ($P = F/A$) and the description of a corn's anatomy explain this perfectly: direct force ($F$) is concentrated by the small area ($A$) of the \"conical keratinous nucleus oriented inward,\" causing high pressure ($P$) on the underlying sensitive dermal and neural structures.\n    -   **Lesion Morphology:** The lesion is described as \"centrally indented,\" which is a characteristic feature of a hard corn (clavus durus), where the center corresponds to the apex of the keratin core.\n\n2.  **Synthesis and Diagnosis:** The combination of the patient's activity (runner), the specific pain profile (pain on direct pressure, no pain on lateral pinch), and the morphology (central indentation) overwhelmingly supports the diagnosis of a **corn (clavus)** over a plantar verruca.\n\n3.  **Predicted Paring Findings:** Based on the diagnosis of a corn and the provided first principles:\n    -   Paring a corn should reveal its central structure, the \"conical keratinous nucleus.\" This core is composed of dense, impacted keratin and often appears translucent or waxy.\n    -   The dermatoglyphics (skin lines) should be \"typically preserved,\" meaning they continue over or around the lesion, as a corn is a reactive thickening of the epidermis that does not disrupt its fundamental structure in the way a viral infection does.\n    -   Since a corn is an avascular hyperkeratosis, there should be no capillary loops within the lesion. Therefore, paring should not reveal \"thrombosed vessels ('black dots')\" or \"punctate bleeding,\" unless the paring is performed too aggressively and penetrates the underlying viable dermis.\n\nThis complete analysis points to one specific combination of diagnosis and confirmatory findings.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Plantar verruca (wart); paring reveals multiple punctate hemorrhages (\"black dots\"), interruption of skin lines, and broadened papillary projections often coalescing into a mosaic pattern.**\nThe diagnosis of plantar verruca is inconsistent with the clinical findings, particularly the pain profile. While the paring findings described are indeed characteristic of a wart, the initial diagnosis is incorrect based on the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Corn (clavus); paring reveals a translucent central keratinous nucleus with surrounding compact hyperkeratosis, skin lines continuous through the lesion, and absence of thrombosed capillaries or punctate bleeding unless paring is excessively deep.**\nThis option correctly identifies the lesion as a corn (clavus) based on the clinical presentation. Furthermore, it accurately describes the classic findings of paring a corn, which are fully consistent with the provided first principles: a central keratinous core, preserved skin lines, and avascularity (no black dots or punctate bleeding). This option correctly integrates all parts of the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Plantar verruca (wart); paring reveals preservation of dermatoglyphics and a central translucent core; the pinch test is negative because warts are deeper than corns.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. It misdiagnoses the lesion as a wart. It then incorrectly describes the paring findings of a wart; \"preservation of dermatoglyphics and a central translucent core\" are features of a corn. Finally, the reasoning for the negative pinch test is false; the pinch test is typically positive for warts, and the statement about relative depth is a misleading oversimplification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Corn (clavus); paring reveals disruption of skin lines with papillary bleeding; the pinch test is typically more painful than direct pressure in corns.**\nThis option correctly identifies the diagnosis as a corn but then provides completely contradictory information. The paring findings listed (\"disruption of skin lines with papillary bleeding\") are definitive signs of a wart. The statement that the pinch test is more painful than direct pressure in corns is factually wrong and directly contradicts the clinical presentation provided.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Intractable plantar keratosis (callus); paring reveals black dots and interrupted lines indicating mechanical hyperkeratosis; pinch test findings are non-specific and therefore diagnosis cannot be made by paring.**\nThis option is flawed throughout. An \"intractable plantar keratosis\" is a diffuse callus, less focal than the described lesion. It incorrectly associates \"black dots and interrupted lines\" (wart findings) with \"mechanical hyperkeratosis.\" It falsely claims that the pinch test is non-specific and diagnosis cannot be made by paring, when in fact these are primary diagnostic tools for distinguishing these lesions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4421419"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis is confidently established, the clinician must turn to the principles of evidence-based medicine to select an appropriate treatment.

It asks for a standard calculation based on fundamental definitions in biostatistics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to derive the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) from first principles. The NNT represents the average number of patients who must be treated with the intervention (salicylic acid) to achieve one additional positive outcome (complete clearance) compared to the control (placebo).\n\nLet $p_t$ be the probability of the favorable outcome (complete clearance) in the treatment group (salicylic acid).\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$$p_t = 0.60$$\n\nLet $p_c$ be the probability of the favorable outcome (complete clearance) in the control group (placebo).\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$$p_c = 0.40$$\n\nThe problem asks us to use the concept of \"risk\". In this context, where the outcome is beneficial (clearance), the \"risk\" can be interpreted as the probability of this outcome occurring. The difference in these probabilities between the treatment and control groups is the Absolute Risk Difference (ARD), although when referring to a beneficial outcome, this is more specifically termed the Absolute Benefit Increase (ABI).\n\nThe Absolute Risk Difference is defined as the difference in the event rates:\n$$ARD = p_t - p_c$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARD = 0.60 - 0.40 = 0.20$$\n\nThis value, $ARD = 0.20$, signifies that for every person treated with salicylic acid, there is a $20\\%$ absolute increase in the probability of achieving complete wart clearance compared to placebo. Alternatively, for every $100$ patients treated, $20$ additional patients will experience complete clearance who would not have done so with placebo.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is, by definition, the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Difference. We can derive this from first principles. Let's consider a cohort of $N$ patients. The expected number of additional clearances achieved by using the treatment instead of the placebo is:\n$$\\text{Additional Clearances} = (N \\times p_t) - (N \\times p_c) = N \\times (p_t - p_c) = N \\times ARD$$\n\nWe are interested in the number of patients, $N$, that need to be treated for the number of additional clearances to be equal to $1$. We set \"Additional Clearances\" to $1$:\n$$1 = N \\times ARD$$\n\nSolving for $N$ gives the $NNT$:\n$$N = \\frac{1}{ARD}$$\nThus, the formula for the $NNT$ is:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{p_t - p_c}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this derived formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.60 - 0.40} = \\frac{1}{0.20}$$\n\nTo express this as an integer, we perform the division:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{1/5} = 5$$\n\nTherefore, one must treat $5$ patients with topical salicylic acid to achieve one additional complete clearance of plantar warts by week $12$ compared to what would have been observed with placebo.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{5} $$", "id": "4421337"}, {"introduction": "The pinnacle of clinical practice lies in synthesizing diagnostic knowledge, evidence appraisal, and procedural skills into a comprehensive and safe management plan for an individual patient.

The pathway must integrate curettage, appropriate anesthesia, and post-operative offloading, guided by the provided principles.\n\nLet's deconstruct the optimal pathway based on the given information:\n\n1.  **Diagnosis and Patient Assessment**: The initial presentation is consistent with a plantar wart. The first step in any surgical plan is to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any contraindications. The problem states that paring reveals thrombosed capillary loops and interruption of skin lines, which are pathognomonic for a plantar wart. A proper pathway would codify this confirmation step. The patient's risk factors for poor healing or complications (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy) have been appropriately screened and are absent.\n\n2.  **Anesthesia**: Curettage is a painful procedure that requires effective local anesthesia. The choice and dosage must be calculated carefully.\n    *   Patient mass: $m = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n    *   The problem specifies the use of lidocaine. For a vascular area like the heel, lidocaine with epinephrine is preferred to enhance local hemostasis and prolong the duration of anesthesia.\n    *   The maximum safe dose of lidocaine with epinephrine is given as approximately $7\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$. For this patient, the maximum dose is:\n        $$ D_{\\text{max}} = (7\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}) \\times (70\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 490\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\n    *   In contrast, the maximum dose for lidocaine without epinephrine is approximately $4\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$:\n        $$ D_{\\text{max, no epi}} = (4\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}) \\times (70\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 280\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\n    *   A $1\\%$ lidocaine solution has a concentration of $10\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. Local infiltration for a single lesion typically requires a small volume (e.g., $3$–$5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$). A generous volume of $10\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ would deliver a total dose of:\n        $$ D_{\\text{delivered}} = (10\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}) \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{mL}) = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\n    *   This dose of $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ is well below the calculated toxic dose of $490\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, confirming its safety. Ankle blocks are generally not necessary for a single, localized lesion and carry a higher risk profile.\n\n3.  **Surgical Procedure**: The question specifies curettage. The correct technique involves:\n    *   Paring away the thick, overlying hyperkeratotic callus to fully expose the underlying wart tissue.\n    *   Using a sharp ring curette to scoop out the soft, friable wart tissue until the firm dermal base is reached. This is often signaled by pinpoint bleeding from the dermal papillae.\n    *   Hemostasis is crucial. The foot is vascular, and curettage induces bleeding. Methods like direct pressure, chemical cautery (e.g., aluminum chloride, ferric subsulfate), or electrosurgery are standard.\n\n4.  **Post-operative Management**: This phase is critical for healing and preventing recurrence, especially in an athlete.\n    *   **Wound Care**: The resulting surgical wound must be dressed appropriately, typically with an occlusive or semi-occlusive dressing.\n    *   **Offloading**: One of the core principles provided is that pain arises from mechanical stress, $\\sigma = F/A$. Post-operatively, the surgical site is an ulcer bed that is highly sensitive to pressure. Offloading is mandatory to reduce this stress, alleviate pain, and promote wound healing. Methods include felt or foam pads with a cutout (\"donut pad\") to redistribute pressure away from the heel.\n    *   **Adjuvant Therapy**: The viral etiology (HPV infecting basal keratinocytes) implies that curettage might leave residual infected cells. Adjuvant topical therapy, such as a keratolytic (e.g., salicylic acid), can help destroy any residual virally infected keratinocytes and reduce the recurrence rate.\n    *   **Follow-up**: Monitoring the healing process and assessing for any signs of recurrence is a standard part of care. A follow-up appointment in $2$–$4$ weeks is appropriate.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this ideal pathway.\n\n**A. Confirm the diagnosis by paring hyperkeratosis and using dermoscopy to identify thrombosed capillaries and interrupted skin lines; screen for vascular and neurologic risk (already normal in this patient). Provide local infiltration anesthesia to the heel with $1\\%$ lidocaine containing epinephrine $1{:}100{,}000$, limiting total volume to $\\leq 10\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ ($100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$), which is well below the maximum $7\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ dose for $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ ($490\\,\\mathrm{mg}$). Perform sharp curettage with a ring curette after careful callus paring, proceeding until pinpoint bleeding is seen. Achieve hemostasis using pressure and topical $20\\%$ aluminum chloride, then apply an occlusive dressing. Institute post-operative offloading with a felt donut pad or semi-compressed foam to divert load away from the lesion and reduce mechanical stress $\\sigma = F/A$ over the ulcer bed for $2$–$4$ weeks; prescribe nightly keratolysis (e.g., $40\\%$ salicylic acid under occlusion) to address residual virally infected keratinocytes, and schedule follow-up in $2$ weeks.**\n\nThis option comprehensively and correctly addresses every component of the ideal pathway derived from the problem's principles. It includes diagnostic confirmation, safe and appropriate anesthesia with correct dose calculation, standard surgical technique, necessary hemostasis, and crucial post-operative care including offloading (explicitly linking to $\\sigma = F/A$), adjuvant therapy (linking to the viral etiology), and follow-up.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Proceed directly to curettage without prior callus paring or diagnostic confirmation; use a topical anesthetic cream only; accept minor bleeding without hemostatic measures; allow immediate return to full running volume; no offloading is needed if pain is reduced by debulking.**\n\nThis option is deeply flawed.\n1.  It skips diagnostic confirmation and essential pre-operative paring.\n2.  Topical anesthesia is insufficient for this procedure.\n3.  Neglecting hemostasis is improper medical practice.\n4.  Recommending immediate return to running without offloading directly contradicts the biomechanical principle of reducing stress ($\\sigma = F/A$) and would cause significant pain and impede healing.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. After brief inspection, anesthetize via an ankle ring block using $2\\%$ lidocaine without epinephrine to a total volume of $20\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ ($400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$), then perform curettage; apply a standard adhesive bandage without specific hemostasis; advise routine footwear use and no offloading.**\n\nThis option presents multiple critical errors.\n1.  \"Brief inspection\" is inadequate for diagnostic confirmation.\n2.  The anesthesia plan is dangerous. The total dose is $20\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. The maximum safe dose for lidocaine *without* epinephrine for this $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ patient is $280\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. This proposed dose of $400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ is toxic.\n3.  The anesthesia choice (ankle block) is excessive for a focal lesion.\n4.  It omits hemostasis and, critically, violates the principle of offloading.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.

The task is to construct a pathway that `integrates curettage`. This option explicitly chooses an alternative therapy (cryotherapy) and defers curettage. Furthermore, it incorrectly advises against offloading, which would still be necessary after aggressive cryotherapy on a weight-bearing surface.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nConclusion: Option A is the only choice that outlines a safe, effective, and evidence-based pathway consistent with all the principles provided in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4421398"}]}
