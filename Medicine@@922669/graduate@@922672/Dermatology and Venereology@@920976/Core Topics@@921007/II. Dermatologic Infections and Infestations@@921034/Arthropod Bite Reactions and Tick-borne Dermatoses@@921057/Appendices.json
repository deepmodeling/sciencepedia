The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the positive predictive value (PPV) of the MTTT algorithm for Lyme borreliosis in the specified cohort. The PPV is the conditional probability that a patient has the disease given that they have tested positive.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease, and let $D^c$ be the complement event, that the patient does not have the disease.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the test result is positive, and let $T^-$ be the complement event, that the test result is negative.\n\nThe information provided can be formulated in the language of conditional probability:\n1.  The prevalence, or prior probability of disease, is $P(D) = 0.10$.\n2.  The probability of not having the disease is the complement of the prevalence: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n3.  The sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the presence of disease: $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.90$. This is the true positive rate.\n4.  The specificity is the probability of a negative test given the absence of disease: $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.95$. This is the true negative rate.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the absence of disease:\n$$ P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe goal is to find the positive predictive value, which is expressed as $P(D \\mid T^+)$. According to Bayes' theorem, this posterior probability is given by:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability by summing the probabilities of the two disjoint events that result in a positive test: a true positive and a false positive.\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B)P(B)$, we can expand this to:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into this expression to compute $P(T^+)$:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.10) + (0.05)(0.90) $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.090 + 0.045 $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.135 $$\n\nWith $P(T^+)$ calculated, we can return to Bayes' theorem to find the PPV, $P(D \\mid T^+)$. The numerator, $P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)$, is the probability of a true positive, which we already calculated as part of the total probability:\n$$ P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) = (0.90)(0.10) = 0.09 $$\n\nTherefore, the positive predictive value is:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.135} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as an exact fraction. To simplify the fraction $\\frac{0.09}{0.135}$, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $1000$ to work with integers:\n$$ \\frac{0.09}{0.135} = \\frac{90}{135} $$\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of $90$ and $135$.\nThe prime factorization of $90$ is $2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$.\nThe prime factorization of $135$ is $3^3 \\times 5$.\nThe greatest common divisor is $3^2 \\times 5 = 45$.\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $45$:\n$$ \\frac{90 \\div 45}{135 \\div 45} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n\nThus, the positive predictive value of the MTTT algorithm in this cohort is $\\frac{2}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "4413415"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a high-risk exposure, the next step is often to consider a preventive intervention.

It is a formalizable, self-contained, and non-trivial problem in applied probability.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Threshold Probability**\n\nLet $p$ be the probability that the patient has RMSF, denoted as event $R$. The probability that the patient does not have RMSF, event $R^c$, is $1-p$. The decision framework uses disutility, where a serious harm event has a disutility of $1$ and no harm has a disutility of $0$. Therefore, the expected disutility of an action is equal to the total probability of serious harm associated with that action. We seek the threshold probability $p^{\\ast}$ at which the expected disutilities of the two actions are equal.\n\nLet the two actions be $A_T$ (treat empirically) and $A_{NT}$ (do not treat empirically). We must find $p^{\\ast}$ such that $E[D(A_T)] = E[D(A_{NT})]$, where $D$ denotes disutility.\n\n**Expected Disutility of \"Do Not Treat\" ($E[D(A_{NT})]$)**\nIf we do not treat, the only potential for serious harm is death from RMSF, which occurs only if the patient has the disease.\n- The untreated case-fatality risk of RMSF is given as $c_{ut} = 0.05$. This is the conditional probability of death given RMSF and no treatment, $P(\\text{Harm}|R, A_{NT})$.\n- If the patient does not have RMSF, there is no disease and no treatment, so the probability of harm is $0$, i.e., $P(\\text{Harm}|R^c, A_{NT}) = 0$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the expected disutility is:\n$$E[D(A_{NT})] = P(\\text{Harm}|A_{NT}) = P(\\text{Harm}|R, A_{NT})P(R) + P(\\text{Harm}|R^c, A_{NT})P(R^c)$$\n$$E[D(A_{NT})] = c_{ut} \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = 0.05p$$\n\n**Expected Disutility of \"Treat Empirically\" ($E[D(A_T)]$)**\nIf we treat, serious harm can arise from two sources: death from RMSF despite treatment, or a serious adverse event from the drug. Let $H_D$ be the event of harm from disease (death) and $H_{drug}$ be the event of harm from the drug. The disutility is $1$ if *any* harm occurs, so we are interested in the probability of the union of these events, $P(H_D \\cup H_{drug})$.\n\nLet's define the relevant probabilities:\n- The risk of a serious drug-related adverse event is $r_{drug} = 0.001$. The problem states this is independent of disease status, so $P(H_{drug}|A_T) = r_{drug}$.\n- The untreated case-fatality risk is $c_{ut} = 0.05$.\n- Treatment provides a relative risk reduction ($RRR$) of $0.90$.\n- The relative risk ($RR$) is $1 - RRR = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n- The treated case-fatality risk, $c_t$, is the untreated risk multiplied by the relative risk:\n$$c_t = c_{ut} \\times RR = 0.05 \\times 0.10 = 0.005$$\nThis is the conditional probability of death from RMSF given that the patient has RMSF and is treated, $P(H_D|R, A_T)$.\n\nThe expected disutility of treatment is the total probability of harm, which we calculate using the law of total probability, conditioning on the patient's disease status:\n$$E[D(A_T)] = P(\\text{Harm}|A_T) = P(\\text{Harm}|R, A_T)P(R) + P(\\text{Harm}|R^c, A_T)P(R^c)$$\n\n- If the patient has RMSF (with probability $p$), harm can occur from the disease or the drug. The probability of harm is $P(H_D \\cup H_{drug} | R, A_T)$. Assuming the events are independent, as is standard in such models unless specified otherwise:\n$$P(\\text{Harm}|R, A_T) = P(H_D|R, A_T) + P(H_{drug}|R, A_T) - P(H_D|R, A_T)P(H_{drug}|R, A_T)$$\n$$P(\\text{Harm}|R, A_T) = c_t + r_{drug} - c_t \\cdot r_{drug}$$\n$$P(\\text{Harm}|R, A_T) = 0.005 + 0.001 - (0.005)(0.001) = 0.006 - 0.000005 = 0.005995$$\n\n- If the patient does not have RMSF (with probability $1-p$), the only source of harm is the drug. The problem states therapy affects outcomes only if RMSF is present, which applies to disease outcome, not drug side effects.\n$$P(\\text{Harm}|R^c, A_T) = P(H_{drug}|R^c, A_T) = r_{drug} = 0.001$$\n\nNow, we assemble the expression for $E[D(A_T)]$:\n$$E[D(A_T)] = (c_t + r_{drug} - c_t \\cdot r_{drug}) \\cdot p + r_{drug} \\cdot (1-p)$$\n$$E[D(A_T)] = (0.005995)p + 0.001(1-p)$$\n$$E[D(A_T)] = 0.005995p + 0.001 - 0.001p$$\n$$E[D(A_T)] = 0.004995p + 0.001$$\n\n**Solving for the Threshold $p^{\\ast}$**\nWe set the expected disutilities equal to find the threshold probability $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$E[D(A_{NT})] = E[D(A_T)]$$\n$$0.05p^{\\ast} = 0.004995p^{\\ast} + 0.001$$\nTo solve for $p^{\\ast}$, we gather the terms involving $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$0.05p^{\\ast} - 0.004995p^{\\ast} = 0.001$$\n$$p^{\\ast}(0.05 - 0.004995) = 0.001$$\n$$p^{\\ast}(0.045005) = 0.001$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.001}{0.045005}$$\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n$$p^{\\ast} \\approx 0.022219753...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$p^{\\ast} \\approx 0.02222$$\nThis threshold means that if the clinician's suspicion (pre-test probability) of RMSF is greater than approximately $2.222\\%$, the expected disutility of serious harm is lower with empiric treatment than without it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02222}$$", "id": "4413429"}]}
