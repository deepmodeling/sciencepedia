The following foundational facts apply: (i) lice eggs (nits) are cemented to hair shafts and do not migrate along the shaft; (ii) scalp temperature decreases with distance from the scalp surface, and embryogenesis of Pediculus humanus capitis eggs requires a narrow thermal range close to scalp temperature; (iii) hair growth is approximately $1\\,\\text{cm}$ per month, so an egg fixed to a given point on the hair shaft will move away from the scalp over time as the hair grows; (iv) the operculum is the apical cap of the egg with aeropyles (respiratory pores), which is shed at hatching; and (v) differences in refractive indices between keratin, embryonic contents, and air determine whether a structure appears pigmented or translucent under dermoscopy. Under dermoscopy of several hairs, the clinician documents two recurring patterns: Pattern $X$ consists of brown to coffee-colored ovoid structures with an intact apical cap bearing punctate dots, completely filled internal contents without an air meniscus, firmly adherent and located within $3$ to $5\\,\\text{mm}$ of the scalp surface. Pattern $Y$ consists of translucent to white ovoid shells with a ragged or absent apical cap and a conspicuous air interface, located $12$ to $20\\,\\text{mm}$ from the scalp surface. The clinician must decide whether there is evidence of active infestation and how to avoid overdiagnosis based on non-viable distant nits.\n\nWhich option best states, on first-principles grounds, the correct dermoscopic identification of viable eggs versus empty shells and an evidence-based criterion to avoid overdiagnosis that follows from the temperature dependence of embryogenesis, the fixed attachment of eggs to hair, and hair growth rate?\n\nA.

Viable eggs are brown with an intact operculum but remain viable even when located $20\\,\\text{mm}$ from the scalp because ambient temperature is sufficient; therefore, brown eggs at $2\\,\\text{cm}$ indicate active infestation, whereas brown proximal eggs should be discounted as debris.", "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of dermatology, biology, and physics. The provided facts are accurate and internally consistent, and the problem is well-posed, objective, and complete, allowing for a logical deduction of the correct answer from first principles.\n\nThe core task is to synthesize the provided facts to correctly identify viable lice eggs versus non-viable/empty shells and to establish a criterion for diagnosing active infestation while avoiding overdiagnosis.\n\n**Analysis from First Principles:**\n\n1.  **Nature of Viable vs. Non-Viable Eggs:** A viable egg is a living, developing embryo encased in a shell. After embryogenesis is complete (typically in $7$ to $10$ days), the louse nymph hatches, leaving an empty shell. An egg that fails to develop or hatch may remain, but it is no longer viable.\n\n2.  **Dermoscopic Appearance (Fact v):** The appearance under dermoscopy is governed by optics, specifically the refractive indices of the materials.\n    -   A viable egg is filled with embryonic fluid and tissue. Light passing through it is absorbed and scattered, resulting in a pigmented appearance. Pattern X, described as \"brown to coffee-colored\" with \"completely filled internal contents without an air meniscus,\" is consistent with a viable, fluid-filled egg.\n    -   An empty eggshell is filled with air. The significant difference between the refractive index of air and the keratin of the shell causes strong light scattering, making the shell appear \"translucent to white,\" as described in Pattern Y. The \"conspicuous air interface\" is the key physical sign of an empty shell.\n\n3.  **Structural Changes upon Hatching (Fact iv):** The egg has an apical cap, the operculum, which is shed upon hatching.\n    -   A viable, unhatched egg will have an \"intact apical cap,\" as noted in Pattern X. The \"punctate dots\" are the aeropyles, or respiratory pores, on the operculum.\n    -   A hatched egg will have a \"ragged or absent apical cap,\" as noted in Pattern Y. This is definitive evidence that the nymph has already emerged.\n\n4.  **Spatial and Temporal Factors (Facts i, ii, iii):** These facts establish a spatiotemporal framework for determining viability.\n    -   **Fact (i):** Eggs are \"cemented to hair shafts\" and do not move. Their position relative to a point on the hair is fixed.\n    -   **Fact (iii):** Hair grows at approximately $1\\,\\text{cm}$ per month. This means the egg's distance from the scalp increases over time.\n    -   **Fact (ii):** Embryogenesis requires a \"narrow thermal range close to scalp temperature.\" As an egg is carried away from the scalp by hair growth, it moves into a cooler environment where it cannot develop or survive. The incubation period is about one week. In one week, hair grows approximately $10\\,\\text{mm} / 4 \\approx 2.5\\,\\text{mm}$. Therefore, any viable, developing egg must be very close to the scalp. A commonly used clinical cutoff is approximately $1/4$ inch, or about $6\\,\\text{mm}$.\n    -   Pattern X structures are found at $3$ to $5\\,\\text{mm}$ from the scalp, which is well within this viable thermal zone and consistent with a recent laying ($$1 month ago).\n    -   Pattern Y structures are found at $12$ to $20\\,\\text{mm}$ from the scalp. This corresponds to a hair growth of over one month ($1.2$ to $2$ months). An egg at this distance is far outside the required thermal zone and would have been laid long ago, meaning it has either hatched or failed to develop.\n\n**Synthesis and Diagnostic Criterion:**\n\n-   **Viable Eggs (Active Infestation):** Based on the synthesis of all facts, viable eggs correspond to Pattern X: brown, filled structures with an intact operculum, located very close to the scalp (e.g., within $3$ to $5\\,\\text{mm}$, and generally less than $6\\,\\text{mm}$).\n-   **Empty Shells (Past Infestation):** Empty shells correspond to Pattern Y: translucent/white, air-filled structures with a missing/ragged operculum, located distant from the scalp (e.g., $10\\,\\text{mm}$ or $1\\,\\text{cm}$), representing the remnants of a past, resolved infestation.\n-   **Avoiding Overdiagnosis:** A diagnosis of active pediculosis requires evidence of living lice or viable eggs. The presence of only distant, empty nit shells (Pattern Y) is not evidence of an active infestation. Therefore, to avoid overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, such findings should be discounted.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Viable eggs are translucent white structures with an open apical cap and no visible internal contents; any nit at any distance signifies active infestation, so treatment should proceed if Pattern $Y$ is present anywhere on the shaft.**\n    This option incorrectly identifies viable eggs with the description of empty shells (Pattern Y). It also incorrectly states that any nit at any distance indicates activity, which contradicts the principle of thermal-dependent viability (Fact ii) and the effect of hair growth (Fact iii). **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. Viable eggs are brown ovoids with intact operculum bearing aeropyles and homogeneous internal contents without an air meniscus, typically found within approximately $6\\,\\text{mm}$ of the scalp; empty shells are translucent or white with an open or missing operculum and a visible air interface, commonly found beyond $10\\,\\text{mm}$. To avoid overdiagnosis, discount distant empty shells (for example, beyond about $1\\,\\text{cm}$) as indicators of past, non-viable infestation in the absence of live lice or viable proximal eggs.**\n    This option correctly identifies viable eggs based on color, contents, and structure (Facts iv, v), consistent with Pattern X. It correctly places them near the scalp ($6\\,\\text{mm}$), consistent with the thermal requirement (Fact ii). It correctly identifies empty shells based on their appearance and structure, consistent with Pattern Y. It correctly places them at a distance consistent with hair growth ($10\\,\\text{mm}$, or $1\\,\\text{cm}$). Most importantly, it provides a sound, evidence-based criterion to avoid overdiagnosis by discounting distant, empty shells. **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. Viable eggs dermoscopically appear as black dots without a discernible operculum; activity is determined solely by density (greater than $5$ nits per $1\\,\\text{cm}$ of hair), and distance from the scalp is irrelevant to viability.**\n    The description of viable eggs is inaccurate. The claim that distance is irrelevant directly contradicts Fact (ii) and Fact (iii). Viability is fundamentally linked to distance from the scalp due to thermal requirements. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Viable eggs are colorless ovals with polar aeropyles that can be slid along the hair shaft with gentle pressure; management should be based on the presence of any nit within $2\\,\\text{cm}$ of the scalp, regardless of morphology, because lice can crawl back to the scalp.**\n    This option makes two critical errors. First, it states that eggs can be slid along the shaft, which contradicts Fact (i) that they are cemented. Second, it uses the flawed reasoning that lice crawling justifies treating distant eggs as viable; however, the eggs themselves are immobile. A nit at $2\\,\\text{cm}$ from the scalp is approximately $2$ months old and non-viable. Ignoring morphology is also incorrect, as it is key to diagnosis. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. Viable eggs are brown with an intact operculum but remain viable even when located $20\\,\\text{mm}$ from the scalp because ambient temperature is sufficient; therefore, brown eggs at $2\\,\\text{cm}$ indicate active infestation, whereas brown proximal eggs should be discounted as debris.**\n    This option correctly describes the appearance of viable eggs but incorrectly claims they are viable at $20\\,\\text{mm}$ ($2\\,\\text{cm}$) from the scalp. This directly contradicts Fact (ii), which specifies a narrow thermal range near the scalp. The conclusion to discount proximal brown eggs is completely illogical and counter to all principles. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4470125"}, {"introduction": "Once an active infestation is confirmed, especially in refractory cases, treatment must be precise and evidence-based. This practice problem [@problem_id:4470161] moves from diagnosis to application, simulating the calculation of a weight-based dose for oral ivermectin.

The child is otherwise healthy and weighs $24\\,\\text{kg}$. Topical therapy has failed, and the clinician considers off-label oral ivermectin with weight-based dosing. It is known from well-tested clinical observations and pharmacology that oral ivermectin is dosed by mass at $200\\,\\mu\\text{g/kg}$ and that ivermectin is non-ovicidal for lice. In pediculosis, eggs (nits) typically hatch in a window consistent with entomologic observations, which for head lice can be modeled as a uniform distribution of hatch times over an interval from $7$ to $10$ days post-treatment, reflecting environmental and biological variability. To optimize timing of the second dose, the clinician chooses to schedule the repeat dose at the expected hatch time under a uniform distribution, rounded to the nearest integer number of days, so that the second dose maximally targets newly hatched nymphs while minimizing the risk of reinfestation.\n\nUsing these foundational facts and definitions:\n- Compute the single oral ivermectin dose in milligrams for the $24\\,\\text{kg}$ child at $200\\,\\mu\\text{g/kg}$, converting micrograms to milligrams using $1\\,\\text{mg} = 1000\\,\\mu\\text{g}$.\n- Determine the repeat dosing interval in whole days by computing the expected hatch time of a uniform distribution on $[7,10]$ days and rounding to the nearest integer.\n\nRound the milligram dose to three significant figures and express the repeat interval as a whole number of days.

The dose of oral ivermectin for parasitic infections ($200\\,\\mu\\text{g/kg}$), the non-ovicidal nature of the drug, and the typical $7-10$ day incubation period for *Pediculus humanus capitis* eggs (nits) are well-established in clinical pharmacology and medical entomology. The use of a uniform distribution is a standard and reasonable simplification for modeling such biological processes in the absence of more detailed data.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary quantitative data (weight, dose/kg, interval bounds, conversion factor) and unambiguous instructions (calculate dose, calculate expected value, rounding rules) to arrive at a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is objective, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically valid. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution is separated into two components as requested: calculation of the ivermectin dose and determination of the repeat dosing interval.\n\n#### Part 1: Ivermectin Dose Calculation\nThe total dose of ivermectin, denoted as $D$, is determined by the patient's body mass, $m$, and the prescribed dosage concentration, $C$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Patient mass, $m = 24\\,\\text{kg}$.\n- Dosage concentration, $C = 200\\,\\mu\\text{g/kg}$.\n\nThe total dose in micrograms, $D_{\\mu\\text{g}}$, is the product of mass and concentration:\n$$D_{\\mu\\text{g}} = m \\times C = (24\\,\\text{kg}) \\times (200\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{kg}})$$\n$$D_{\\mu\\text{g}} = 4800\\,\\mu\\text{g}$$\n\nThe problem requires the dose to be expressed in milligrams ($mg$). The conversion factor is given as $1\\,\\text{mg} = 1000\\,\\mu\\text{g}$. The dose in milligrams, $D_{\\text{mg}}$, is therefore:\n$$D_{\\text{mg}} = \\frac{D_{\\mu\\text{g}}}{1000\\,\\mu\\text{g/mg}} = \\frac{4800\\,\\mu\\text{g}}{1000\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{mg}}} = 4.8\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nThe problem demands that this result be rounded to three significant figures. The number $4.8$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, a trailing zero must be added.\n$$D_{\\text{mg}} = 4.80\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\n#### Part 2: Repeat Dosing Interval Calculation\nThe timing of the second dose is based on the expected hatch time of the nits. The problem models the hatch time, $T$, as a random variable following a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[a, b]$, where $a = 7$ days and $b = 10$ days.\n\nThe probability density function $f(t)$ for a uniform distribution on $[a, b]$ is given by:\n$$f(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b-a}  \\text{for } a \\le t \\le b \\\\ 0  \\text{for } t  a \\text{ or } t  b \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe expected value (mean) of a random variable $T$ following this distribution is $E[T]$.\n$$E[T] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} t f(t) \\,dt = \\int_{a}^{b} t \\frac{1}{b-a} \\,dt = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\left[ \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right]_{a}^{b} = \\frac{b^2-a^2}{2(b-a)} = \\frac{(b-a)(b+a)}{2(b-a)}$$\nFor $a \\neq b$, this simplifies to the well-known formula for the mean of a uniform distribution:\n$$E[T] = \\frac{a+b}{2}$$\n\nSubstituting the given interval bounds $a=7$ and $b=10$:\n$$E[T] = \\frac{7 + 10}{2} = \\frac{17}{2} = 8.5\\,\\text{days}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the dosing interval, $I$, should be this expected value rounded to the nearest integer.\n$$I = \\text{round}(8.5) = 9\\,\\text{days}$$\nTherefore, the second dose should be administered on day $9$ post-treatment. This timing is chosen because ivermectin is non-ovicidal; the second dose must target the nymphs after they have hatched but before they mature and lay new eggs.\n\n#### Part 3: Note on Contraindications\nAs requested, it is pertinent to note the standard contraindications and precautions for the use of oral ivermectin, particularly in a pediatric context for pediculosis, even though they may not apply to this specific \"otherwise healthy\" patient. These include:\n- **Body Weight**: Oral ivermectin is generally not recommended for children weighing less than $15\\,\\text{kg}$ due to a lack of safety and efficacy data. The patient's weight of $24\\,\\text{kg}$ is above this threshold.\n- **Blood-Brain Barrier**: Patients with a compromised blood-brain barrier (e.g., due to meningitis or other CNS pathology) are at increased risk of neurotoxicity.\n- **Concomitant Medications**: Co-administration with drugs that enhance GABA-ergic activity (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, sodium valproate) should be avoided as ivermectin can potentiate their effects.\n- **Pregnancy and Lactation**: Ivermectin is a Pregnancy Category C drug. Its safety during lactation is not definitively established, and it is excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. These are not relevant for the specified pediatric patient.\n- **Hypersensitivity**: A known hypersensitivity to ivermectin or any component of its formulation is an absolute contraindication.\n\nThe calculations for the specified patient are now complete. The final answer is a row matrix containing the dose in milligrams and the interval in days.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4.80  9\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4470161"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical practice extends beyond the individual patient to understanding the evidence that shapes treatment guidelines.

The committee is debating whether gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) should be retained as a therapeutic option. Frame your evaluation from first principles of toxicology and pharmacology, combining the biology of lice with population-level risk-benefit reasoning.\n\nFundamental bases you may use include:\n- The definition of therapeutic index (TI): the ratio of a toxic dose to an effective dose, $$TI = \\frac{LD_{50}}{ED_{50}}$$, with narrower $$TI$$ implying less safety margin.\n- The general expected-value framework for clinical decision-making: expected net clinical utility $$U = B - R$$, where $$B$$ denotes expected benefit (e.g., probability of cure multiplied by the value of cure) and $$R$$ denotes expected risk (e.g., probability of adverse outcome multiplied by its severity).\n- Mechanistic toxicology: organochlorines such as lindane act as antagonists of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) gated chloride channels, producing neuronal hyperexcitability in arthropods; central nervous system (CNS) toxicity in humans arises when systemic exposure exceeds a threshold.\n\nConsider the following scientifically plausible scenario and facts:\n- In a region with documented treatment failures, head lice cure probabilities after a single, correctly administered course are approximately $$p_{\\text{cure,permethrin}} \\approx 0.80$$ for permethrin $$1\\%$$ lotion, $$p_{\\text{cure,spinosad}} \\approx 0.90$$ for spinosad $$0.9\\%$$ suspension, $$p_{\\text{cure,ivermectin\\_topical}} \\approx 0.85$$ for topical ivermectin $$0.5\\%$$, and $$p_{\\text{cure,lindane}} \\approx 0.60$$ for lindane $$1\\%$$ shampoo. These values reflect observed resistance patterns in several locales.\n- Serious neurotoxicity (seizure, encephalopathy) probabilities when used as labeled are $$p_{\\text{neurotox,permethrin}}  10^{-6}$$, $$p_{\\text{neurotox,spinosad}}  10^{-5}$$, $$p_{\\text{neurotox,ivermectin\\_topical}}  10^{-5}$$, and $$p_{\\text{neurotox,lindane}} \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-4}$$; with misuse (e.g., occlusive application, repeated dosing within $$ 7$$ days, application to damaged skin or mucosa), $$p_{\\text{neurotox,lindane\\_misuse}}$$ may rise to $$\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-3}$$.\n- Lindane is lipophilic, has relatively slow elimination, and can accumulate with repeated or occlusive use, increasing systemic exposure. Absorption is greater across thin skin, high surface-area-to-body-mass ratios (e.g., infants), and mucosa contiguous with hair-bearing genital skin.\n- In pediculosis corporis, lice primarily inhabit clothing seams rather than skin; laundering and heat decontamination of clothing and bedding are the primary interventions, and topical pediculicides provide marginal additional benefit unless infestations are severe.\n- Multiple regulatory bodies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have historically issued warnings or restricted use of lindane due to CNS toxicity and limited efficacy; availability has been curtailed in several jurisdictions. World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations prioritize safer alternatives.\n\nWhich of the following statements best justify why lindane use is largely discouraged in modern practice for pediculosis capitis, corporis, and pubis? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Lindane’s narrow therapeutic index and documented CNS toxicity, together with widespread resistance that lowers $$p_{\\text{cure}}$$ relative to safer alternatives, yields an unfavorable expected net utility $$U$$ for routine use; therefore, it should not be used as first-line therapy.\n\nB. Lindane is strongly ovicidal and achieves near-certain eradication (cure probability $$ 0.95$$) even in resistant populations, so it remains a preferred first-line agent for pediculosis capitis.\n\nC. In pediculosis pubis, application to hair-bearing genital skin adjacent to mucosa, especially under occlusion or with repeated dosing within $$ 7$$ days, increases systemic absorption and the probability of neurotoxicity; therefore, non-lindane therapies are preferred to minimize $$R$$.\n\nD. In pediculosis corporis, because lice reside in clothing seams, environmental control by laundering and heat decontamination produces most of the benefit $$B$$; adding lindane confers only marginal incremental $$B$$ while increasing $$R$$, making its routine use unjustified.\n\nE.

The provided information regarding lindane's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and toxicity profile is consistent with established pharmacology and toxicology. The cure rates and risk probabilities are clinically plausible representations of a scenario involving resistance and comparative safety. The distinction between a drug's effect on ectoparasites and host toxicity is a fundamental concept.\n- **Well-Posed:** Yes. The problem provides a clear question and a rich, self-contained dataset and conceptual framework ($$U = B - R$$) to answer it. It is structured to allow for a logical, evidence-based evaluation of the provided options.\n- **Objective:** Yes. The problem presents quantitative data (probabilities) and established scientific facts (pharmacokinetics, regulatory status) without subjective or biased language. It asks for a justification based on these facts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The solution will proceed by applying the provided principles and data.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core of the problem is a risk-benefit analysis framed by the expected net utility equation, $$U = B - R$$. A rational clinical decision favors therapies with higher net utility. We will evaluate lindane relative to its alternatives for each type of pediculosis.\n\nLet the benefit, $$B$$, be proportional to the probability of cure, $$p_{\\text{cure}}$$. Let the risk, $$R$$, be proportional to the probability of a serious adverse event, $$p_{\\text{neurotox}}$$. A simplified utility comparison can be made by directly examining $$p_{\\text{cure}}$$ and $$p_{\\text{neurotox}}$$ for each agent.\n\n**For Pediculosis Capitis (Head Lice):**\n- **Benefit ($$B$$):** The data show that lindane has the lowest cure probability: $$p_{\\text{cure,lindane}} \\approx 0.60$$. Alternatives have significantly higher efficacy: $$p_{\\text{cure,permethrin}} \\approx 0.80$$, $$p_{\\text{cure,ivermectin\\_topical}} \\approx 0.85$$, and $$p_{\\text{cure,spinosad}} \\approx 0.90$$. Lindane offers a substantially lower expected benefit.\n- **Risk ($$R$$):** Lindane has the highest probability of serious neurotoxicity: $$p_{\\text{neurotox,lindane}} \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-4}$$. This is at least an order of magnitude higher than the risks associated with the alternatives ($$ 10^{-5}$$ for spinosad and ivermectin, $$ 10^{-6}$$ for permethrin). The risk of lindane is at least $$50$$ times greater than that of spinosad or topical ivermectin.\n- **Net Utility ($$U$$):** Since lindane has both a lower benefit term ($$B$$) and a higher risk term ($$R$$) compared to alternatives, its net utility, $$U_{\\text{lindane}}$$, is substantially inferior. The concept of the therapeutic index ($$TI$$) is also relevant; a lower efficacy ($$ED_{50}$$ would be high) and higher toxicity ($$LD_{50}$$ is conceptually related to the toxic dose) result in a clinically unfavorable risk-benefit profile, even without calculating a formal numeric $$TI$$.\n\n**For Pthirus Pubis (Pubic Lice):**\nThe analysis for head lice applies, but the risk component is exacerbated. The problem states that lindane's absorption is greater across thin skin and mucosa, which are characteristic of the genital region where pubic lice are treated. Increased absorption leads to higher systemic drug levels, which in turn increases the probability of CNS toxicity, $$p_{\\text{neurotox}}$$. Thus, the already high risk term $$R$$ is further magnified in this application, making lindane an even less favorable choice.\n\n**For Pediculosis Corporis (Body Lice):**\nThe problem states that body lice primarily live in clothing seams, not on the skin. The primary and most effective intervention is environmental decontamination (laundering/heating clothes). Topical pediculicides provide only \"marginal additional benefit\".\n- **Benefit ($$B$$):** The incremental benefit, $$\\Delta B$$, from adding a topical agent like lindane is very small.\n- **Risk ($$R$$):** Applying lindane to the body still carries the risk of systemic absorption and neurotoxicity, so $$R  0$$.\n- **Net Utility ($$U$$):** The net utility of adding lindane is $$U = \\Delta B - R$$. Since $$\\Delta B$$ is marginal and $$R$$ is a non-trivial risk, the utility is low and possibly negative. It is not justified to expose a patient to the risk of neurotoxicity for a negligible therapeutic gain.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Lindane’s narrow therapeutic index and documented CNS toxicity, together with widespread resistance that lowers $$p_{\\text{cure}}$$ relative to safer alternatives, yields an unfavorable expected net utility $$U$$ for routine use; therefore, it should not be used as first-line therapy.**\nThis statement accurately combines the key points of the analysis. \"Narrow therapeutic index and documented CNS toxicity\" refers to the high risk, $$R$$. \"Widespread resistance that lowers $$p_{\\text{cure}}$$ relative to safer alternatives\" refers to the low benefit, $$B$$. The conclusion that this results in an \"unfavorable expected net utility $$U$$\" is the direct result of applying the $$U = B - R$$ framework. The clinical recommendation against first-line use is therefore fully justified by the premises.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Lindane is strongly ovicidal and achieves near-certain eradication (cure probability  0.95) even in resistant populations, so it remains a preferred first-line agent for pediculosis capitis.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect according to the provided data. The problem explicitly states that in the given scenario, $$p_{\\text{cure,lindane}} \\approx 0.60$$, which is far from \" $$0.95$$\". The premise is false, and therefore the conclusion is unsupported.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In pediculosis pubis, application to hair-bearing genital skin adjacent to mucosa, especially under occlusion or with repeated dosing within  7 days, increases systemic absorption and the probability of neurotoxicity; therefore, non-lindane therapies are preferred to minimize $$R$$.**\nThis statement is fully supported by the provided information. It correctly identifies that the anatomical site of pubic lice infestation leads to increased systemic absorption of lindane, as stated in the pharmacokinetic facts. This increased absorption logically increases the risk of toxicity, which corresponds to an increase in the risk term $$R$$. Preferring alternatives with a much lower intrinsic risk profile is the logical step to minimize $$R$$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. In pediculosis corporis, because lice reside in clothing seams, environmental control by laundering and heat decontamination produces most of the benefit $$B$$; adding lindane confers only marginal incremental $$B$$ while increasing $$R$$, making its routine use unjustified.**\nThis statement correctly analyzes the specific situation of pediculosis corporis. It uses the given fact that lice are primarily in clothing to deduce that the incremental benefit ($$\\Delta B$$) of a topical agent is marginal. It correctly notes that applying lindane still introduces the risk of toxicity ($$R$$). The conclusion, that a marginal benefit does not justify a non-zero risk, is a sound application of risk-benefit reasoning.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Resistance to lindane is uncommon because its GABA receptor target is highly conserved and cannot mutate without lethality; therefore, resistance does not contribute to discouraging its use.**\nThis statement makes two claims that are contradicted by the problem's premises. First, it claims resistance is \"uncommon,\" but the low cure rate of $$p_{\\text{cure,lindane}} \\approx 0.60$$ in a region with \"documented treatment failures\" and \"observed resistance patterns\" indicates that resistance is a clinically significant problem. Second, it claims resistance does not contribute to discouraging its use, which is false; the low efficacy (low $$B$$) is a primary reason for its unfavorable utility $$U_$$ compared to alternatives. The theoretical argument about the conserved target is irrelevant in the face of empirical evidence of treatment failure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "4470091"}]}
