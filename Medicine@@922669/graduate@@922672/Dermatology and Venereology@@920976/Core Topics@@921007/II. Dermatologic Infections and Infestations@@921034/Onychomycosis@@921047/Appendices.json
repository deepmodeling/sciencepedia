The clinical context (onychomycosis diagnosis), the test (KOH microscopy), and the performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, pretest probability) are all scientifically plausible and consistent with clinical practice and literature in dermatology. The problem is correctly framed within its specified field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

A solution will be derived from fundamental principles as requested.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has true onychomycosis, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have onychomycosis.\nLet $T+$ be the event that the KOH test result is positive, and let $T-$ be the event that the result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed in probabilistic terms:\n1.  The pretest probability of disease is $P(D) = 0.50$.\n2.  The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present. This is a conditional probability:\n    $$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T+|D) = 0.75 $$\n4.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent. This is also a conditional probability:\n    $$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T-|D^c) = 0.90 $$\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can deduce the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is absent:\n$$ P(T+|D^c) = 1 - P(T-|D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the post-test probability of onychomycosis given a positive KOH result, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T+)$. We begin with the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(T+)} $$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(D \\cap T+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(T+|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(D)} \\implies P(D \\cap T+) = P(T+|D)P(D) $$\nSubstituting this back gives the standard form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D)P(D)}{P(T+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated for the entire patient cohort by considering both true positives and false positives. Using the Law of Total Probability, we can partition the event $T+$ based on the presence or absence of the disease:\n$$ P(T+) = P(T+ \\cap D) + P(T+ \\cap D^c) $$\nAgain, using the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$ P(T+) = P(T+|D)P(D) + P(T+|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nThis expression for $P(T+)$ is now substituted into the denominator of Bayes' theorem. This yields the full, derived expression for the post-test probability, constructed from the fundamental definitions and the given parameters (sensitivity, specificity, and pretest probability):\n$$ P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D)P(D)}{P(T+|D)P(D) + P(T+|D^c)P(D^c)} $$\nThis equation is the derived expression for the post-test probability.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value by substituting the given parameters:\n- $P(D) = 0.50$\n- $P(D^c) = 0.50$\n- $P(T+|D) = 0.75$\n- $P(T+|D^c) = 0.10$\n\n$$ P(D|T+) = \\frac{(0.75)(0.50)}{(0.75)(0.50) + (0.10)(0.50)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 0.75 \\times 0.50 = 0.375 $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator Term 1 (True Positives)} = 0.75 \\times 0.50 = 0.375 $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator Term 2 (False Positives)} = 0.10 \\times 0.50 = 0.050 $$\nThe total probability of a positive test is:\n$$ P(T+) = 0.375 + 0.050 = 0.425 $$\nFinally, we compute the ratio:\n$$ P(D|T+) = \\frac{0.375}{0.425} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ P(D|T+) \\approx 0.88235294... $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(D|T+) \\approx 0.8824 $$\nThis value represents the probability that a patient with this clinical presentation and a positive KOH test truly has onychomycosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8824}$$", "id": "4468199"}, {"introduction": "A common source of confusion for patients is the significant delay between achieving mycological cure and seeing a visibly normal nail, which can impact treatment adherence and satisfaction.
