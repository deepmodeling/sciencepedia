It describes a classic clinical presentation of cutaneous larva migrans, a well-documented parasitic skin infestation. The provided data are quantitative and consistent. The task is a direct application of fundamental kinematics (the definition of average speed) to a real-world biological scenario. The parameters ($L_i$, $L_f$, $\\Delta t$) are physically realistic for this condition. No scientific principles are violated, no essential information is missing, and the problem is free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe fundamental principle for this problem is the definition of average speed, or in this context, the mean rate of advance, denoted by $\\bar{v}$. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time. In this case, the distance traveled is the net increase in the length of the track, $\\Delta L$, over the time interval $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$ \\bar{v} = \\frac{\\Delta L}{\\Delta t} $$\n\nThe net increase in the track length, $\\Delta L$, is the difference between the final length, $L_f$, and the initial length, $L_i$.\n$$ \\Delta L = L_f - L_i $$\n\nThe givens are:\n- Initial length: $L_i = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Final length: $L_f = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Time interval: $\\Delta t = 3\\,\\mathrm{days}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total advancement of the track, $\\Delta L$:\n$$ \\Delta L = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{cm} - 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\n\nNext, we compute the mean daily advance, $\\bar{v}$, by dividing the total advancement by the time interval:\n$$ \\bar{v} = \\frac{0.9\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{3\\,\\mathrm{days}} = 0.3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{cm}}{\\mathrm{day}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters per day ($\\mathrm{mm/day}$). We use the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$ \\bar{v} = 0.3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{cm}}{\\mathrm{day}} \\times \\left(\\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{cm}}\\right) = 3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mm}}{\\mathrm{day}} $$\n\nThe problem explicitly requests the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $3$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $3.00$.\n$$ \\bar{v} = 3.00\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mm}}{\\mathrm{day}} $$\n\nFinally, an interpretation is required regarding the compatibility of this result with the known clinical behavior of CLM. The problem states that CLM tracks are known to advance \"a few millimeters per day\". Our calculated mean daily advance of $3.00\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}$ falls squarely within this expected range. An advance of a few millimeters per day is a hallmark of this condition, distinguishing it from other dermatoses. Therefore, the observed kinetics are entirely consistent with and supportive of a clinical diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.00}\n$$", "id": "4426288"}, {"introduction": "While a skin biopsy may seem like the definitive method for diagnosing a cutaneous lesion, its utility depends on the probability of sampling the causative agent.

Cutaneous Larva Migrans is a known dermatological condition, and punch biopsy is a standard diagnostic procedure. The lengths $L=30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $d=4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ are realistic. The assumption of a uniform distribution for the larva's position is a common and reasonable starting point in modeling when there is no information to suggest otherwise (the principle of indifference). The problem is free of pseudoscience and adheres to logical and mathematical principles.\n\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information to compute a unique probability. The statement that the larva's position $X$ is \"uniformly distributed along the track arclength\" precisely defines the probability model. The biopsy is stated to sample a \"contiguous arclength segment of length $d=4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\" at a \"fixed chosen site along the track\". This implies that the sampled segment is a sub-interval of the total track length $[0, L]$. Although the exact position of this site is not specified, the nature of the uniform distribution ensures that the probability of success is independent of the chosen site, as long as the entire $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ sample is taken from the $30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ track. The probability of the uniformly distributed random variable falling into any sub-interval of a given length is constant, regardless of the sub-interval's position. Therefore, the problem is not underspecified and admits a unique solution.\n\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language with clearly defined quantitative parameters. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n\nThe problem passes all validation criteria. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the position of the advancing larval head along the track, parameterized by the arclength $s$. The track extends from $s=0$ to $s=L$, where $L=30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The sample space for the position $X$ is the interval $[0, L]$.\n\nThe problem states that $X$ is uniformly distributed over this interval. The probability density function (PDF) for a continuous uniform distribution on an interval $[a, b]$ is given by $f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}$ for $x \\in [a, b]$ and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise. In this case, with $a=0$ and $b=L$, the PDF for the larva's position is:\n$$\nf_X(s) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{L} & \\text{for } s \\in [0, L] \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nA single punch biopsy is performed, which samples a contiguous segment of the track of length $d = 4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Let this segment be represented by the interval $I$. Since the biopsy is performed \"along the track\", this interval $I$ must be a sub-interval of $[0, L]$. The length of this interval $I$ is given as $d$.\n\nThe biopsy is successful if it includes the larval head, which means the random variable $X$ must take a value within the interval $I$. The probability of this event, let's call it $P(\\text{success})$, is the integral of the PDF over the interval $I$:\n$$\nP(\\text{success}) = P(X \\in I) = \\int_I f_X(s) \\, ds\n$$\nSince $I$ is a sub-interval of $[0, L]$, the value of $f_X(s)$ is constant at $\\frac{1}{L}$ for all $s \\in I$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\nP(\\text{success}) = \\int_I \\frac{1}{L} \\, ds\n$$\nBecause $\\frac{1}{L}$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nP(\\text{success}) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_I \\, ds\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_I ds$ represents the length of the integration interval $I$. The problem specifies that the biopsy samples a segment of length $d$. Thus, the length of $I$ is $d$.\n$$\n\\int_I ds = d\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the probability expression gives:\n$$\nP(\\text{success}) = \\frac{d}{L}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the probability of success depends only on the ratio of the biopsy length to the total track length, not on the specific location of the biopsy along the track (provided the entire biopsy segment is within the track).\n\nThe problem provides the numerical values $L = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $d = 4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Substituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\nP(\\text{success}) = \\frac{4}{30}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as an exact fraction. Simplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$\nP(\\text{success}) = \\frac{2}{15}\n$$\nThis is the final probability that the biopsy includes the advancing larval head under the given modeling assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{15}}$$", "id": "4426342"}, {"introduction": "Effective and safe treatment is the cornerstone of patient management, and for CLM, this often involves systemic therapy with agents like ivermectin.

Let $n$ be the integer number of tablets. The administered dose, $D_{admin}$, is given by:\n\n$$D_{admin}(n) = n \\times S_T = n \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nWe must find the integer $n$ that satisfies two conditions:\n1.
