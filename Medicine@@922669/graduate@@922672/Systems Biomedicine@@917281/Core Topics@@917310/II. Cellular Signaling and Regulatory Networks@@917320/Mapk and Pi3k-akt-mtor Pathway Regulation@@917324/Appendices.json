The rate of change of $[PIP3]$ is the difference between its production flux and the sum of its removal fluxes.\nThe production flux by PI3K is given as a constant, $v_{PI3K}$.\nThe removal fluxes by PTEN and SHIP are given by first-order kinetics:\n- $v_{PTEN}([PIP3]) = k_{PTEN}\\,[PIP3]$\n- $v_{SHIP}([PIP3]) = k_{SHIP}\\,[PIP3]$\n\nThe ordinary differential equation governing the concentration of $[PIP3]$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{d[PIP3]}{dt} = v_{PI3K} - v_{PTEN}([PIP3]) - v_{SHIP}([PIP3]) $$\n$$ \\frac{d[PIP3]}{dt} = v_{PI3K} - k_{PTEN}\\,[PIP3] - k_{SHIP}\\,[PIP3] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[PIP3]}{dt} = v_{PI3K} - (k_{PTEN} + k_{SHIP})\\,[PIP3] $$\n\nAt the baseline steady state, the concentration of PIP3 is constant at $[PIP3]_{0}$.

It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It does not violate any of the specified rules for invalidity.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to compute the rebound fold-change $F$ for AKT Serine 473 phosphorylation, defined as $F = \\dfrac{S_{\\text{post}}}{S_{\\text{pre}}}$. The subscripts \"pre\" and \"post\" refer to the states before and after rapamycin treatment, respectively.\n\nGiven the relationship $S = cP$, where $c$ is a constant, the fold-change $F$ can be expressed in terms of PI3K output $P$:\n$$F = \\frac{S_{\\text{post}}}{S_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{cP_{\\text{post}}}{cP_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{post}}}{P_{\\text{pre}}}$$\nThe constant of proportionality $c$ cancels out.\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for PI3K output, $P = P_{\\max} \\dfrac{I^{n}}{K^{n} + I^{n}}$, into the equation for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{P_{\\max} \\dfrac{I_{\\text{post}}^{n}}{K^{n} + I_{\\text{post}}^{n}}}{P_{\\max} \\dfrac{I_{\\text{pre}}^{n}}{K^{n} + I_{\\text{pre}}^{n}}}$$\nThe maximum PI3K output, $P_{\\max}$, also cancels, yielding an expression for $F$ that depends only on the effective IRS1 activities ($I_{\\text{pre}}, I_{\\text{post}}$) and the Hill parameters ($K, n$):\n$$F = \\frac{I_{\\text{post}}^{n}}{I_{\\text{pre}}^{n}} \\cdot \\frac{K^{n} + I_{\\text{pre}}^{n}}{K^{n} + I_{\\text{post}}^{n}}$$\n\nThe solution requires a step-by-step calculation of the required quantities.\n\n1.  **Calculate post-treatment mTORC1 output ($M_{\\text{post}}$)**:\n    Given $M_{\\text{pre}} = 2.0$ and rapamycin efficacy $e = 0.7$, the post-treatment mTORC1 output is:\n    $$M_{\\text{post}} = (1 - e) M_{\\text{pre}} = (1 - 0.7) \\times 2.0 = 0.3 \\times 2.0 = 0.6$$\n\n2.  **Calculate pre-treatment effective IRS1 activity ($I_{\\text{pre}}$)**:\n    Using the given parameters $I_{0} = 1.0$, $\\alpha = 1.5$, and $M_{\\text{pre}} = 2.0$:\n    $$I_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{I_{0}}{1 + \\alpha M_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{1.0}{1 + (1.5)(2.0)} = \\frac{1.0}{1 + 3.0} = \\frac{1.0}{4.0} = 0.25$$\n\n3.  **Calculate post-treatment effective IRS1 activity ($I_{\\text{post}}$)**:\n    Using $I_{0} = 1.0$, $\\alpha = 1.5$, and the calculated $M_{\\text{post}} = 0.6$:\n    $$I_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{I_{0}}{1 + \\alpha M_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{1.0}{1 + (1.5)(0.6)} = \\frac{1.0}{1 + 0.9} = \\frac{1.0}{1.9}$$\n\n4.  **Calculate the rebound fold-change ($F$)**:\n    Now, we substitute the values of $I_{\\text{pre}}$, $I_{\\text{post}}$, and the parameters $K = 0.3$ and $n = 2$ into the expression for $F$.\n    $$F = \\left(\\frac{I_{\\text{post}}}{I_{\\text{pre}}}\\right)^{n} \\frac{K^{n} + I_{\\text{pre}}^{n}}{K^{n} + I_{\\text{post}}^{n}}$$\n    We compute the necessary terms:\n    -   $I_{\\text{pre}}^{n} = I_{\\text{pre}}^{2} = (0.25)^{2} = 0.0625$\n    -   $I_{\\text{post}}^{n} = I_{\\text{post}}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1.0}{1.9}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1.0}{3.61}$\n    -   $K^{n} = K^{2} = (0.3)^{2} = 0.09$\n\n    Substitute these values into the expression for $F$:\n    $$F = \\frac{\\frac{1.0}{3.61}}{0.0625} \\cdot \\frac{0.09 + 0.0625}{0.09 + \\frac{1.0}{3.61}}$$\n    First, evaluate the numerator and denominator of the second fraction:\n    -   Numerator: $0.09 + 0.0625 = 0.1525$\n    -   Denominator: $0.09 + \\frac{1.0}{3.61} = \\frac{0.09 \\times 3.61 + 1.0}{3.61} = \\frac{0.3249 + 1.0}{3.61} = \\frac{1.3249}{3.61}$\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for $F$:\n    $$F = \\left(\\frac{1.0}{3.61 \\times 0.0625}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{0.1525}{\\frac{1.3249}{3.61}} = \\left(\\frac{1.0}{0.225625}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.1525 \\times 3.61}{1.3249}\\right)$$\n    The calculation simplifies to:\n    $$F = \\frac{0.1525}{0.0625} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{1.3249}{3.61}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3.61} = \\frac{0.1525}{0.0625} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1.3249} = \\frac{0.1525}{0.0625 \\times 1.3249} = \\frac{0.1525}{0.08280625}$$\n    $$F \\approx 1.84164$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$F \\approx 1.84$$\n\nThis result quantifies the paradoxical rebound in AKT Serine 473 phosphorylation that occurs due to the relief of negative feedback when mTORC1 is acutely inhibited. The fold-change greater than $1$ indicates an increase in the signal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.84}$$", "id": "4358767"}]}
