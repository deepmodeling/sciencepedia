Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) is a canonical UPR effector whose main open reading frame (ORF) translation is controlled by two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its $5^{\\prime}$ leader. In the canonical scanning model of eukaryotic translation initiation, scanning preinitiation complexes decode start codons in a $5^{\\prime}$ to $3^{\\prime}$ manner, initiating when a start codon is recognized with an available ternary complex. After terminating translation of a short uORF, a ribosome may resume scanning and, once it reacquires a ternary complex, reinitiate at the next start codon it encounters.\n\nConsider a simplified event-tree model of ATF4 translation with the following assumptions grounded in the scanning and reinitiation framework:\n- Each scanning preinitiation complex that arrives at the ATF4 $5^{\\prime}$ leader either initiates at uORF1 with probability $p_{1}$ or bypasses it. The contribution of ribosomes that bypass uORF1 to main ORF initiation is negligible because the inhibitory uORF2 has strong start codon context and captures these ribosomes. You may therefore ignore main ORF initiation from the bypassing branch.\n- Conditional on having translated uORF1, a ribosome may reinitiate at uORF2 with probability $f_{2}$. If it reinitiates at uORF2, it does not initiate at the main ORF on that pass. If it does not reinitiate at uORF2, it is assumed to reinitiate at the main ORF with probability $1$ upon encountering the main start codon.\n- Drop-off between stops and starts and any contribution from leaky scanning at the main ORF are negligible.\n\nEmpirical ribosome profiling under two conditions provides the following measurements:\n- Low eIF2α phosphorylation (basal): $p_{1,\\mathrm{low}} = 0.90$, and among ribosomes that translated uORF1, $f_{2,\\mathrm{low}} = 0.80$.\n- High eIF2α phosphorylation (UPR-activated): $p_{1,\\mathrm{high}} = 0.85$, and among ribosomes that translated uORF1, $f_{2,\\mathrm{high}} = 0.30$.\n\nUsing only the definitions of conditional probability and the scanning/reinitiation model assumptions above, compute the fold-change in the steady-state rate of main ORF initiation at high versus low eIF2α phosphorylation, defined as\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{main ORF initiation probability per scanning complex at high}}{\\text{main ORF initiation probability per scanning complex at low}}.\n$$\nExpress your final answer as an exact fraction.

Let us trace this path using the provided probabilities:\n1.  A scanning complex must first initiate translation at uORF1. The probability of this event is $p_1$. The alternative path, bypassing uORF1, is assumed to not lead to main ORF initiation and is therefore ignored. Thus, initiation at uORF1 is a necessary prerequisite.\n2.  After translating uORF1, the ribosome resumes scanning. It then encounters the start codon of uORF2. The problem states that the ribosome may reinitiate at uORF2 with a conditional probability of $f_2$. This event precludes main ORF initiation.\n3.  For main ORF initiation to be possible, the ribosome must *not* reinitiate at uORF2. The probability of this event, conditional on having translated uORF1, is the complement of reinitiating at uORF2, which is $1 - f_2$.\n4.
