The system is governed by the principles of mass action equilibrium and mass conservation.\n\nLet us define the relevant species and their concentrations:\n- $[N_f]$: The cytoplasmic concentration of free NF-κB.\n- $[I_f]$: The cytoplasmic concentration of free IκB.\n- $[C]$: The cytoplasmic concentration of the NF-κB–IκB complex.\n- $[N]$: The total cytoplasmic concentration of NF-κB (both free and bound).\n- $[I]$: The total cytoplasmic concentration of IκB (both free and bound).\n- $K_d$: The dissociation constant for the NF-κB–IκB complex.\n\nThe problem states that the binding is one-to-one, leading to the reaction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NF\\text{-}\\kappa B} + \\mathrm{I\\kappa B} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{NF\\text{-}\\kappa B\\text{--}I\\kappa B}\n$$\nThis is simplified as $N_f + I_f \\rightleftharpoons C$.\n\nThe system is described by three core equations:\n\n1.  **Mass Conservation for NF-κB**: The total cytoplasmic concentration of NF-κB, $[N]$, is the sum of the free form and the complexed form.\n    $$[N] = [N_f] + [C]$$\n\n2.  **Mass Conservation for IκB**: Similarly, the total cytoplasmic concentration of IκB, $[I]$, is the sum of its free and complexed forms.\n    $$[I] = [I_f] + [C]$$\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Condition**: The binding reaction is assumed to be at rapid equilibrium. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action.\n    $$K_d = \\frac{[N_f][I_f]}{[C]}$$\n    The assumption that nuclear import of free NF-κB is fast justifies analyzing the cytoplasmic pool at a steady state where this equilibrium holds, and the free NF-κB concentration is small but non-zero, driving translocation.\n\nOur goal is to find an expression for the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{cyto}}$, defined as the ratio of the concentration of NF-κB bound in the complex to the total cytoplasmic NF-κB concentration:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{cyto}} = \\frac{[C]}{[N]}$$\n\nTo solve for $[C]$, we first express the concentrations of the free species, $[N_f]$ and $[I_f]$, in terms of the total concentrations $[N]$, $[I]$, and the complex concentration $[C]$ using the mass conservation equations:\n$$[N_f] = [N] - [C]$$\n$$[I_f] = [I] - [C]$$\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions into the equilibrium equation:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([N] - [C])([I] - [C])}{[C]}$$\n\nWe now rearrange this equation into a standard quadratic form, $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$, where the variable is $x = [C]$:\n$$K_d [C] = ([N] - [C])([I] - [C])$$\n$$K_d [C] = [N][I] - [N][C] - [I][C] + [C]^2$$\n$$0 = [C]^2 - ([N] + [I] + K_d)[C] + [N][I]$$\n\nThis quadratic equation for $[C]$ can be solved using the quadratic formula:\n$$[C] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nHere, $a = 1$, $b = -([N] + [I] + K_d)$, and $c = [N][I]$.\nSubstituting these coefficients, we get:\n$$[C] = \\frac{([N] + [I] + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{(-([N] + [I] + K_d))^2 - 4(1)([N][I])}}{2(1)}$$\n$$[C] = \\frac{([N] + [I] + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{([N] + [I] + K_d)^2 - 4[N][I]}}{2}$$\n\nWe must select the physically meaningful root.

The solution with the '+' sign would yield a value for $[C]$ that is larger than $[N] + [I]$, which is physically impossible.

In this case, $[C] = \\min([N], [I])$. The '+' root does not satisfy this limit.\n\nLet's test the '-' root. For example, if $[I]=0$, the equation for $[C]$ becomes $[C]^2 - ([N]+K_d)[C] = 0$, giving solutions $[C]=0$ and $[C]=[N]+K_d$. The physical solution is $[C]=0$. The '-' root of the quadratic formula gives:\n$$[C] = \\frac{([N] + K_d) - \\sqrt{([N] + K_d)^2}}{2} = \\frac{([N] + K_d) - ([N] + K_d)}{2} = 0$$\nThis matches the physical expectation.

This is to be achieved by fitting a kinetic model to the provided time-course data.\n\n### Step 1: Mathematical Modeling of the Kinetic Process\n\nThe problem states that the processes follow first-order mass-action kinetics toward a non-zero steady-state baseline. Let $C(t)$ represent the concentration (or normalized intensity) of the molecular species at time $t$, and let $B$ be the non-zero baseline concentration. The rate of change of $C(t)$ is proportional to the difference between the current concentration and the baseline. This can be expressed as the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k(C(t) - B)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order rate constant with units of inverse time (here, $\\text{min}^{-1}$).\n\nThis is a separable, first-order linear ODE. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{dC'}{C' - B} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nwhere $C_0 = C(0)$ is the initial concentration. The integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|C' - B|]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|C(t) - B| - \\ln|C_0 - B| = -kt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t) - B}{C_0 - B}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(t) = (C_0 - B)e^{-kt} + B\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the data is normalized such that the initial value at $t=0$ is $1.0$. Therefore, we set the initial condition $C_0 = 1$. The model to be fitted to the data becomes:\n$$\nC(t) = (1 - B)e^{-kt} + B\n$$\nThe parameters to be estimated from the experimental data for each trajectory are the rate constant $k$ and the baseline $B$.\n\n### Step 2: Parameter Estimation via Non-Linear Least Squares\n\nTo estimate the parameters $k$ and $B$ from the provided data points $(t_i, C_i)$, we use the method of non-linear least squares. This method finds the parameter values that minimize the sum of the squared residuals (SSR) between the model predictions and the measured data:\n$$\nSSR(k, B) = \\sum_{i} [C_i - C(t_i; k, B)]^2 = \\sum_{i} \\left[C_i - \\left((1 - B)e^{-kt_i} + B\\right)\\right]^2\n$$\nThis minimization will be performed numerically using the `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` function, which is well-suited for fitting a user-defined function to data. This function typically implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. For robustness, we must provide physically plausible bounds for the parameters:\n- The rate constant $k$ must be non-negative, so $k \\ge 0$.\n- The baseline concentration $B$ must be non-negative. As the concentration decays from an initial value of $1$, the baseline cannot exceed this initial value. Thus, $0 \\le B \\le 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Half-Life\n\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as \"the time required for the deviation from baseline to be reduced by a factor of $1/2$\". The deviation from the baseline at time $t$ is given by $C(t) - B$. At $t=0$, the initial deviation is $C_0 - B$. We seek the time $t_{1/2}$ such that:\n$$\nC(t_{1/2}) - B = \\frac{1}{2}(C_0 - B)\n$$\nSubstituting the model equation $C(t) - B = (C_0 - B)e^{-kt}$:\n$$\n(C_0 - B)e^{-kt_{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_0 - B)\n$$\nAssuming the initial concentration is not equal to the baseline ($C_0 \\neq B$), we can divide by $(C_0 - B)$:\n$$\ne^{-kt_{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-kt_{1/2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$ yields the classic formula for a first-order process:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nOnce the rate constant $k$ is estimated from the data fitting, the half-life $t_{1/2}$ can be calculated directly. Since the time data is in minutes, the fitted $k$ will be in $\\text{min}^{-1}$, and the resulting $t_{1/2}$ will be in minutes.\n\n### Step 4: Implementation Strategy\n\nFor each test case and for each molecular species (IκBα and pSTAT3), the following procedure is applied:\n1.  The time-course data $(t, C(t))$ is provided as input to the `curve_fit` function.\n2.  The fitting function is defined as $f(t, k, B) = (1 - B)e^{-kt} + B$.\n3.  Initial guesses for the parameters ($k, B$) and the specified bounds ($k \\in [0, \\infty)$, $B \\in [0, 1]$) are supplied to the fitting algorithm to ensure convergence to a physically meaningful solution. A reasonable initial guess for $B$ is the final data point, and for $k$ is the reciprocal of the final time point.\n4.  The algorithm returns the optimized values for $k$ and $B$.\n5.  The half-life $t_{1/2}$ is computed using the formula $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k$.\n6.  The estimated $k$ and calculated $t_{1/2}$ are rounded to $4$ decimal places as required. This process is repeated for all trajectories.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for kinetic parameters from time-course data based on a first-order\n    decay model to a non-zero baseline.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"t\": [0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60],\n            \"ikba\": [1.00, 0.78, 0.62, 0.40, 0.23, 0.19],\n            \"pstat3\": [1.00, 0.84, 0.72, 0.50, 0.28, 0.19],\n        },\n        {\n            \"t\": [0, 15, 30, 60, 120],\n            \"ikba\": [1.00, 0.79, 0.64, 0.44, 0.27],\n            \"pstat3\": [1.00, 0.93, 0.87, 0.75, 0.57],\n        },\n        {\n            \"t\": [0, 30, 90],\n            \"ikba\": [1.00, 0.47, 0.16],\n            \"pstat3\": [1.00, 0.79, 0.53],\n        },\n        {\n            \"t\": [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50],\n            \"ikba\": [1.00, 0.71, 0.54, 0.43, 0.36, 0.34],\n            \"pstat3\": [1.00, 0.80, 0.66, 0.51, 0.40, 0.34],\n        },\n    ]\n\n    def model_func(t, k, B):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the first-order decay model to a non-zero baseline.\n        C(t) = (C0 - B) * exp(-k*t) + B, with C0 = 1.0.\n        \n        Args:\n            t (np.ndarray): Time points.\n            k (float): First-order rate constant.\n            B (float): Non-zero baseline.\n        \n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: Modeled concentration at time points t.\n        \"\"\"\n        return (1.0 - B) * np.exp(-k * t) + B\n\n    def process_trajectory(t_data, y_data):\n        \"\"\"\n        Fits the model to a single data trajectory to find k and calculates t_1/2.\n        \n        Args:\n            t_data (np.ndarray): Time data.\n            y_data (np.ndarray): Concentration data.\n            \n        Returns:\n            tuple[float, float]: Estimated rate constant k and half-life t_1/2.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Heuristic initial guesses for parameters k and B for robustness.\n        # Guess k as the reciprocal of the last time point.\n        # Guess B as the last measured concentration.\n        # Handle case where t_data might only have one point after t=0.\n        k_guess = 1.0 / t_data[-1] if t_data[-1] > 0 else 0.1\n        b_guess = y_data[-1]\n        p0 = [k_guess, b_guess]\n        \n        # Define physical bounds for parameters. k must be non-negative.\n        # B must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive).\n        bounds = ([0, 0], [np.inf, 1.0])\n        \n        try:\n            params, _ = curve_fit(model_func, t_data, y_data, p0=p0, bounds=bounds, maxfev=5000)\n            k_est, _ = params\n        except RuntimeError:\n            # Fallback in case of fitting failure, though unlikely with these data\n            k_est = 0.0\n\n        # Calculate half-life from the estimated rate constant\n        if k_est > 0:\n            t_half = np.log(2) / k_est\n        else:\n            t_half = np.inf\n            \n        return k_est, t_half\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        t_arr = np.array(case[\"t\"], dtype=float)\n        ikba_arr = np.array(case[\"ikba\"], dtype=float)\n        pstat3_arr = np.array(case[\"pstat3\"], dtype=float)\n\n        k_ikba, t_half_ikba = process_trajectory(t_arr, ikba_arr)\n        k_pstat3, t_half_pstat3 = process_trajectory(t_arr, pstat3_arr)\n        \n        case_results = [k_ikba, t_half_ikba, k_pstat3, t_half_pstat3]\n        all_results.append(case_results)\n\n    # Format the final output string exactly as specified.\n    # Each sublist is converted to a string with numbers formatted to 4 decimal places.\n    # These sublist strings are then joined by commas and enclosed in brackets.\n    sublist_strings = []\n    for res in all_results:\n        formatted_res = [f'{x:.4f}' for x in res]\n        sublist_strings.append(f\"[{','.join(formatted_res)}]\")\n    \n    final_output_string = f\"[{','.join(sublist_strings)}]\"\n    print(final_output_string)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "4369738"}]}
