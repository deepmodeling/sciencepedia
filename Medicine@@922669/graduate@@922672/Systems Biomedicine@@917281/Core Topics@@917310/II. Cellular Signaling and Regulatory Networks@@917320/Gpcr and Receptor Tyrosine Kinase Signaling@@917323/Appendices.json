It presents a standard scenario in receptor pharmacology and requests derivations and calculations based on fundamental, well-established principles. All provided information is self-consistent and sufficient to solve the problem as stated.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Ligand Concentration $[L]$**\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for the required ligand concentration $[L]$ to achieve a target fractional occupancy $\\theta$ in terms of the dissociation constant $K_D$ and $\\theta$. We start from the two provided fundamental bases:\n\n1.  Equilibrium dissociation constant: $K_D = \\dfrac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$\n2.  Receptor conservation: $R_T = [R] + [RL]$\n\nThe fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is defined as $\\theta = \\dfrac{[RL]}{R_T}$.\n\nFirst, we substitute the receptor conservation equation into the definition of $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nWe rearrange this equation to find an expression for the ratio of bound to free receptor, $\\dfrac{[RL]}{[R]}$:\n$$ \\theta ([R] + [RL]) = [RL] $$\n$$ \\theta[R] + \\theta[RL] = [RL] $$\n$$ \\theta[R] = [RL](1 - \\theta) $$\nThus, we have:\n$$ \\frac{[RL]}{[R]} = \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} $$\nNext, we rearrange the definition of the dissociation constant $K_D$ to solve for $[L]$:\n$$ [L] = K_D \\frac{[RL]}{[R]} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dfrac{[RL]}{[R]}$ into this equation yields the desired relationship between $[L]$, $K_D$, and $\\theta$:\n$$ [L] = K_D \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} $$\nThis expression allows calculation of the ligand concentration needed to achieve any target occupancy $\\theta$ if $K_D$ is known.\n\nNow, we compute the required concentration for the given values: $K_D = 5.0$ nM and $\\theta = 90\\% = 0.9$.\n$$ [L] = (5.0 \\text{ nM}) \\frac{0.9}{1 - 0.9} = (5.0 \\text{ nM}) \\frac{0.9}{0.1} = (5.0 \\text{ nM}) \\times 9 = 45 \\text{ nM} $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures as requested, the required ligand concentration is $45.0$ nM.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Logarithmic Sensitivity $S$**\n\nThe task is to compute the logarithmic sensitivity $S$ of the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ with respect to the dissociation constant $K_D$, at a fixed ligand concentration $[L]$. The sensitivity is defined as:\n$$ S = \\frac{d \\ln \\theta}{d \\ln K_D} $$\nThis can be expanded using the chain rule for derivatives as $S = \\dfrac{K_D}{\\theta} \\dfrac{d\\theta}{dK_D}$. To proceed, we first need an expression for $\\theta$ as a function of $K_D$ and a fixed $[L]$.

A direct approach using logarithmic differentiation is most efficient.\n$$ \\ln \\theta = \\ln\\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}\\right) = \\ln[L] - \\ln(K_D + [L]) $$\nDifferentiating $\\ln \\theta$ with respect to $\\ln K_D$ (recalling that $[L]$ is held constant):\n$$ S = \\frac{d(\\ln \\theta)}{d(\\ln K_D)} = \\frac{d(\\ln[L] - \\ln(K_D + [L]))}{d(\\ln K_D)} $$\nSince $\\ln[L]$ is a constant with respect to $K_D$, its derivative is zero.\n$$ S = - \\frac{d(\\ln(K_D + [L]))}{d(\\ln K_D)} $$\nUsing the chain rule, $du = u \\cdot d(\\ln u)$, we have $d(\\ln(K_D + [L])) = \\dfrac{d(K_D+ [L])}{K_D+[L]} = \\dfrac{dK_D}{K_D+[L]}$ and $d(\\ln K_D) = \\dfrac{dK_D}{K_D}$.\n$$ S = - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{dK_D}{K_D + [L]} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{dK_D}{K_D} \\right)} = - \\frac{K_D}{K_D + [L]} $$\nWe can further simplify this expression.
