Modeling rare, independent events like DNA damage lesion formation as a Poisson process is a standard and well-established technique in quantitative and systems biology. The concept of 8-oxoG as a form of oxidative damage is factually correct. The superposition principle for Poisson processes is a fundamental theorem of probability theory.

A reasoned solution will be formulated.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem asks for the expected number and variance of 8-oxoG lesions formed over a $24$-hour period in a cell. The formation process is modeled based on fundamental principles of stochastic processes.\n\n1.  **Process at a Single Base:** The formation of a lesion at any single susceptible base is described as a homogeneous Poisson process. The rate of this process is given as $k$, the per-base oxidation rate. Let's denote the rate for a single base $i$ as $\\lambda_i$. According to the problem statement, this rate is constant across all susceptible bases, so $\\lambda_i = k$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, G\\}$. The units of $k$ are lesions per base per hour.\n\n2.  **Total Process Across the Genome:** The total number of lesions in the genome is the sum of lesions occurring at all $G$ susceptible bases. The events at different bases are stated to be independent. The problem explicitly directs us to use the property that the superposition (sum) of independent Poisson processes is itself a Poisson process. The rate of this new superposed process, which we can call $\\lambda_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the rates of the individual processes.\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{G} \\lambda_i $$\n    Since $\\lambda_i = k$ for all $G$ bases, the sum becomes:\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{G} k = Gk $$\n    This aggregate rate, $\\lambda_{\\text{total}}$, represents the total number of lesions expected to form across the entire genome per hour.\n\n3.  **Number of Events in a Time Interval:** For a homogeneous Poisson process with a constant rate $\\lambda$, the number of events, $N(T)$, occurring in a time interval of duration $T$ is a random variable that follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\Lambda = \\lambda T$. The probability mass function is given by $P(N(T)=n) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\Lambda) \\Lambda^n}{n!}$.\n    In our case, the total rate is $\\lambda_{\\text{total}} = Gk$, and the time interval is $T = 24$ hours.\n    Therefore, the parameter $\\Lambda$ for the distribution of the total number of lesions, $N_{\\text{total}}$, over one day is:\n    $$ \\Lambda = \\lambda_{\\text{total}} \\times T = (Gk) \\times 24 = 24Gk $$\n    So, the total number of lesions accumulated in one day, $N_{\\text{total}}(24)$, follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $24Gk$:\n    $$ N_{\\text{total}}(24) \\sim \\text{Poisson}(24Gk) $$\n\n4.  **Expected Value and Variance:** A key property of the Poisson distribution is that both its expected value (mean) and its variance are equal to its rate parameter $\\Lambda$.\n    For a random variable $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\Lambda)$:\n    -   Expected value: $E[X] = \\Lambda$\n    -   Variance: $\\text{Var}(X) = \\Lambda$\n\n    Applying this to our result for $N_{\\text{total}}(24)$, we find the expected number and variance of 8-oxoG lesions accumulated over a $24$-hour period.\n    -   The expected number of lesions is:\n        $$ E[N_{\\text{total}}(24)] = \\Lambda = 24Gk $$\n    -   The variance of the number of lesions is:\n        $$ \\text{Var}(N_{\\text{total}}(24)) = \\Lambda = 24Gk $$\n\n    Both the expected number and the variance of the accumulated lesions over one day are equal to $24Gk$.

The problem is stated objectively, is mathematically formalizable, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It does not violate any scientific principles and is directly relevant to the specified topic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution follows.\n\nThe derivation of the lesion processing rate, $v([S])$, begins with the elementary reaction steps:\n$$ E + S \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{on}}} ES $$\n$$ ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{off}}} E + S $$\n$$ ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{cat}}} E + P $$\nApplying the law of mass action, the rate of change of the enzyme-substrate complex concentration, $[ES]$, is:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[E][S] - k_{\\text{off}}[ES] - k_{\\text{cat}}[ES] = k_{\\text{on}}[E][S] - (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] $$\nThe quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) posits that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant after a brief initial transient phase, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this assumption gives:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}}[E][S] = (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] $$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E_{\\text{T}}]$, is the sum of the free enzyme, $[E]$, and the complexed enzyme, $[ES]$:\n$$ [E_{\\text{T}}] = [E] + [ES] $$\nThus, the free enzyme concentration can be expressed as $[E] = [E_{\\text{T}}] - [ES]$. Substituting this into the steady-state equation:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}}([E_{\\text{T}}] - [ES])[S] = (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] $$\nWe now solve for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}}[E_{\\text{T}}][S] - k_{\\text{on}}[ES][S] = (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] $$\n$$ k_{\\text{on}}[E_{\\text{T}}][S] = [ES](k_{\\text{on}}[S] + k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}}) $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}[E_{\\text{T}}][S]}{k_{\\text{on}}[S] + k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}}} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k_{\\text{on}}$ yields the standard form:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E_{\\text{T}}][S]}{\\frac{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} + [S]} $$\nThe instantaneous lesion processing rate, $v$, is the rate of formation of the product $P$, which is given by $v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]$. Substituting the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$ v([S]) = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E_{\\text{T}}][S]}{\\frac{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} + [S]} $$\nThis is the Michaelis-Menten equation. We define the Michaelis constant $K_M = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$ and the maximum velocity $V_{\\max} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E_{\\text{T}}]$. The rate law is thus:\n$$ v([S]) = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the instantaneous lesion processing rate.\n\nNext, we evaluate the initial throughput at $t=0$. First, we compute the initial substrate (lesion) concentration, $[S_0]$, from the number of lesions $L_0$ in the nuclear volume $V_{\\text{n}}$ using Avogadro's constant $N_A$.\n$$ [S_0] = \\frac{L_0}{N_A V_{\\text{n}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ [S_0] = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{5}}{(6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1})(5.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{L})} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^5}{3.011 \\times 10^{11}}\\ \\text{M} \\approx 1.66058 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M} $$\nNow, we calculate the Michaelis constant, $K_M$:\n$$ K_M = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{3.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1} + 20.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{5.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{23.0}{5.0 \\times 10^{7}}\\ \\text{M} = 4.6 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M} $$\nThe initial rate of reaction in molar concentration per second, $v_0 = v([S_0])$, is:\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E_{\\text{T}}][S_0]}{K_M + [S_0]} = \\frac{(20.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M})(1.66058 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M})}{4.6 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M} + 1.66058 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}} $$\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{3.32116 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{M}^2\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}}{2.12058 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}} \\approx 1.56615 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThis rate is in moles per liter per second. The problem asks for the throughput in number of lesions processed per minute per cell. We convert the rate $v_0$ to these units.
