It represents a standard application of Linear Programming (LP) duality and sensitivity analysis to the field of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) in metabolic network modeling. The solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Dual LP for FBA\n\nThe primal FBA problem is formulated as a maximization LP:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{maximize} \\quad  c^{\\top} v \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad  S v = 0 \\\\\n l \\leq v \\leq u\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the flux vector, $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the objective vector, $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ is the stoichiometric matrix, and $l, u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are the lower and upper bounds on the fluxes, respectively.\n\nTo derive the dual, we first write the constraints in a standard less-than-or-equal-to form for a maximization problem:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n S v \\leq 0 \\\\\n -S v \\leq 0 \\\\\n v \\leq u \\\\\n -v \\leq -l\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe assign non-negative Lagrange multipliers (dual variables) to each constraint. Let $\\lambda^{+} \\geq 0$ and $\\lambda^{-} \\geq 0$ be the dual variables for $S v \\leq 0$ and $-S v \\leq 0$, respectively. It is conventional to combine these into a single free variable $\\lambda = \\lambda^{+} - \\lambda^{-} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ corresponding to the equality constraint $S v = 0$. Let $\\mu_u \\geq 0$ be the dual variables for $v \\leq u$ (i.e., $v - u \\leq 0$), and $\\mu_l \\geq 0$ be the dual variables for $-v \\leq -l$ (i.e., $l - v \\leq 0$).\n\nThe Lagrangian function for the primal problem is:\n$$\nL(v, \\lambda, \\mu_u, \\mu_l) = c^{\\top} v - \\lambda^{\\top}(S v) - \\mu_u^{\\top}(v - u) - \\mu_l^{\\top}(l - v)\n$$\nwhere a standard sign convention for the multipliers is used. Rearranging terms based on the primal variable $v$:\n$$\nL(v, \\lambda, \\mu_u, \\mu_l) = (c^{\\top} - \\lambda^{\\top}S - \\mu_u^{\\top} + \\mu_l^{\\top})v + \\mu_u^{\\top}u - \\mu_l^{\\top}l\n$$\nThe dual function $g(\\lambda, \\mu_u, \\mu_l)$ is the supremum of the Lagrangian with respect to $v$. For the supremum to be finite, the coefficient of $v$ must be zero. This gives the dual feasibility constraint:\n$$\nc^{\\top} - \\lambda^{\\top}S - \\mu_u^{\\top} + \\mu_l^{\\top} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad S^{\\top}\\lambda + \\mu_u - \\mu_l = c\n$$\nWhen this condition holds, the Lagrangian is independent of $v$, and the dual function is $g = \\mu_u^{\\top}u - \\mu_l^{\\top}l$. The dual LP seeks to minimize this function subject to the dual feasibility constraints.\n\nThus, the dual LP is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{minimize} \\quad  u^{\\top}\\mu_u - l^{\\top}\\mu_l \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad  S^{\\top}\\lambda + \\mu_u - \\mu_l = c \\\\\n \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\quad (\\text{free}) \\\\\n \\mu_u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\mu_u \\geq 0 \\\\\n \\mu_l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\mu_l \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe dual variable $\\lambda$ corresponds to the mass balance constraints $S v = 0$, and the dual variables $\\mu_u$ and $\\mu_l$ correspond to the upper and lower bound constraints on the fluxes, respectively.\n\n### Part 2: Primal Solution and Dual Variable Calculation via KKT Conditions\n\nThe specific FBA problem is:\n- Metabolites: $A$ (row 1), $B$ (row 2).\n- Reactions: $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4)^{\\top}$.\n- Objective: maximize $v_3$, so $c = (0, 0, 1, 0)^{\\top}$.\n- Constraints:\n$$\nS v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  -1  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nl = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\leq v \\leq u = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ \\infty \\\\ \\infty \\\\ \\infty \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis expands to:\n1.  $v_1 - v_2 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_2$\n2.  $v_2 - v_3 - v_4 = 0 \\implies v_3 = v_2 - v_4$\n3.  $0 \\leq v_1 \\leq 10$\n4.  $v_2 \\geq 0, v_3 \\geq 0, v_4 \\geq 0$\n\nTo maximize $v_3$, we must maximize $v_2$ and minimize $v_4$. From constraint (1) and (3), $v_2 = v_1$, so the maximum possible value for $v_2$ is $10$. From constraint (4), the minimum possible value for $v_4$ is $0$.\nSubstituting these into constraint (2) gives the maximum objective value: $v_3 = 10 - 0 = 10$.\nThe optimal primal flux vector is $v^* = (10, 10, 10, 0)^{\\top}$. The optimal objective value is $Z^* = 10$.\n\nNext, we use the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find the optimal dual variables. The KKT conditions consist of primal feasibility (satisfied by $v^*$), dual feasibility, and complementary slackness.\nThe dual feasibility conditions are $S^{\\top}\\lambda + \\mu_u - \\mu_l = c$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ -1  1 \\\\ 0  -1 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_A \\\\ \\lambda_B \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{u1} \\\\ \\mu_{u2} \\\\ \\mu_{u3} \\\\ \\mu_{u4} \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{l1} \\\\ \\mu_{l2} \\\\ \\mu_{l3} \\\\ \\mu_{l4} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe complementary slackness conditions are $\\mu_{u,j}(v_j^* - u_j) = 0$ and $\\mu_{l,j}(l_j - v_j^*) = 0$ for each reaction $j=1, \\dots, 4$.\n- For $v_1^* = 10$: The upper bound $u_1=10$ is active, so $\\mu_{u1} \\geq 0$. The lower bound $l_1=0$ is not active, so $\\mu_{l1} = 0$.\n- For $v_2^* = 10$: No finite upper bound ($u_2 = \\infty$), so $\\mu_{u2} = 0$. The lower bound $l_2=0$ is not active, so $\\mu_{l2} = 0$.\n- For $v_3^* = 10$: No finite upper bound ($u_3 = \\infty$), so $\\mu_{u3} = 0$. The lower bound $l_3=0$ is not active, so $\\mu_{l3} = 0$.\n- For $v_4^* = 0$: The upper bound $u_4=\\infty$ is not active, so $\\mu_{u4} = 0$. The lower bound $l_4=0$ is active, so $\\mu_{l4} \\geq 0$.\n\nSubstituting these known zero values into the dual feasibility equations:\n1.  $(j=1): \\quad \\lambda_A + \\mu_{u1} - 0 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_A + \\mu_{u1} = 0$\n2.  $(j=2): \\quad -\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_B = \\lambda_A$\n3.  $(j=3): \\quad -\\lambda_B + 0 - 0 = 1 \\implies \\lambda_B = -1$\n4.  $(j=4): \\quad -\\lambda_B + 0 - \\mu_{l4} = 0 \\implies \\mu_{l4} = -\\lambda_B$\n\nFrom equation (3), we find $\\lambda_B^* = -1$.\nFrom equation (2), it follows that $\\lambda_A^* = \\lambda_B^* = -1$.\nFrom equation (1), $\\mu_{u1}^* = -\\lambda_A^* = -(-1) = 1$. This satisfies $\\mu_{u1} \\geq 0$.\nFrom equation (4), $\\mu_{l4}^* = -\\lambda_B^* = -(-1) = 1$. This satisfies $\\mu_{l4} \\geq 0$.\n\nThe optimal dual variables associated with the mass balance constraints are $\\lambda_A^* = -1$ and $\\lambda_B^* = -1$.\n\n### Part 3: Shadow Price of Metabolite B\n\nThe problem defines the shadow price of availability for a metabolite (e.g., $B$) as $-\\lambda_B$, where $\\lambda_B$ is the dual variable for the mass balance equation of metabolite $B$.\nFrom our calculation in Part 2, the optimal dual variable for metabolite $B$ is $\\lambda_B^* = -1$.\n\nTherefore, the shadow price of availability for metabolite $B$, according to the specified convention, is:\n$$\n\\text{Shadow Price}_B = -\\lambda_B^* = -(-1) = 1\n$$\nThis value represents the marginal increase in the objective function (biomass production, $v_3$) for a unit increase in the availability of metabolite $B$ as an external input. An input of $B$ at a rate of $\\epsilon$ changes the mass balance to $v_2 - v_3 - v_4 = -\\epsilon$, allowing $v_3$ to increase by $\\epsilon$. The marginal value is $\\frac{dZ^*}{d\\epsilon}=1$, which confirms our result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4287610"}]}
