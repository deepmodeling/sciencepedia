We will proceed step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Assembly of the Stoichiometric Matrix $S$**\nThe stoichiometric matrix $S$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix where $m=5$ is the number of species and $n=3$ is the number of reactions. The rows correspond to species $(A, B, C, D, E)$ and the columns to reactions $(R_1, R_2, R_3)$. Each entry $S_{ij}$ is the net change in the number of molecules of species $i$ due to one instance of reaction $j$.\n\n-   For reaction $R_{1}\\!: A + 2B \\rightarrow C$:\n    -   One molecule of $A$ is consumed: $S_{11} = -1$.\n    -   Two molecules of $B$ are consumed: $S_{21} = -2$.\n    -   One molecule of $C$ is produced: $S_{31} = 1$.\n    -   Species $D$ and $E$ are not involved: $S_{41} = 0$, $S_{51} = 0$.\n    -   The first column of $S$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1  -2  1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$.\n\n-   For reaction $R_{2}\\!: C + D \\rightarrow E$:\n    -   One molecule of $C$ is consumed: $S_{32} = -1$.\n    -   One molecule of $D$ is consumed: $S_{42} = -1$.\n    -   One molecule of $E$ is produced: $S_{52} = 1$.\n    -   Species $A$ and $B$ are not involved: $S_{12} = 0$, $S_{22} = 0$.\n    -   The second column of $S$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  -1  -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$.\n\n-   For reaction $R_{3}\\!: E \\rightarrow A + D$:\n    -   One molecule of $E$ is consumed: $S_{53} = -1$.\n    -   One molecule of $A$ is produced: $S_{13} = 1$.\n    -   One molecule of $D$ is produced: $S_{43} = 1$.\n    -   Species $B$ and $C$ are not involved: $S_{23} = 0$, $S_{33} = 0$.\n    -   The third column of $S$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$.\n\nCombining these columns, the stoichiometric matrix $S$ is:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  0  1 \\\\\n-2  0  0 \\\\\n1  -1  0 \\\\\n0  -1  1 \\\\\n0  1  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n2.  **Column Sums Vector $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$**\nThe column sums are calculated as $\\sigma_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} S_{ij}$ for each reaction $j=1, 2, 3$.\n-   $\\sigma_1 = S_{11} + S_{21} + S_{31} + S_{41} + S_{51} = -1 + (-2) + 1 + 0 + 0 = -2$.\n-   $\\sigma_2 = S_{12} + S_{22} + S_{32} + S_{42} + S_{52} = 0 + 0 + (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1$.\n-   $\\sigma_3 = S_{13} + S_{23} + S_{33} + S_{43} + S_{53} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + (-1) = 1$.\nThe column sums vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$.\n**Interpretation**: Each component $\\sigma_j$ represents the net change in the total number of molecules in the system when reaction $R_j$ occurs once. For $R_1$, $3$ molecules are consumed and $1$ is produced, for a net change of $-2$. For $R_2$, $2$ molecules are consumed and $1$ is produced, net change $-1$. For $R_3$, $1$ molecule is consumed and $2$ are produced, net change $+1$.\n\n3.  **Sum of Columns and Cycle Consistency**\nWe sum the column vectors of $S$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{3} S_{\\cdot j} = S_{\\cdot 1} + S_{\\cdot 2} + S_{\\cdot 3} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1+0+1 \\\\ -2+0+0 \\\\ 1-1+0 \\\\ 0-1+1 \\\\ 0+1-1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n**Interpretation**: This resulting vector represents the net stoichiometric change if each reaction occurs once, effectively completing one cycle of the network. The net reaction is $A+2B+C+D+E \\rightarrow C+E+A+D$, which simplifies to $2B \\rightarrow \\emptyset$. The zero entries for species $A, C, D, E$ indicate that they are part of an internal, balanced cycle and are regenerated. The $-2$ entry for species $B$ shows that it is an external input that is consumed by the system at a rate of $2$ molecules per cycle, effectively driving the network.\n\n4.  **Number of Linearly Independent Conservation Relations**\nThe number of linearly independent conservation relations is given by the dimension of the left nullspace of $S$, denoted $\\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top}))$. A conservation relation is represented by a vector $l \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$ such that $l^{\\top}S = \\mathbf{0}^{\\top}$, which is equivalent to $S^{\\top}l = \\mathbf{0}$.\nBy the rank-nullity theorem applied to the matrix $S^{\\top}$ (which is a $3 \\times 5$ matrix), we have:\n$$\n\\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top})) + \\text{rank}(S^{\\top}) = \\text{number of columns of } S^{\\top}\n$$\nThe number of columns of $S^{\\top}$ is the number of rows of $S$, which is $m=5$. Also, the rank of a matrix and its transpose are equal, i.e., $\\text{rank}(S^{\\top}) = \\text{rank}(S)$. Thus, the formula becomes:\n$$\n\\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top})) = 5 - \\text{rank}(S)\n$$\nWe need to find the rank of the $5 \\times 3$ matrix $S$. The rank is the dimension of the column space, which is the number of linearly independent columns. Let the columns be $v_1, v_2, v_3$. We test for linear independence by solving the equation $c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3 = \\mathbf{0}$ for scalars $c_1, c_2, c_3$. This is the system $S\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{0}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  0  1 \\\\\n-2  0  0 \\\\\n1  -1  0 \\\\\n0  -1  1 \\\\\n0  1  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ c_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the second row equation, $-2c_1 = 0$, which implies $c_1 = 0$.\nSubstituting $c_1=0$ into the first row equation, $-c_1 + c_3 = 0$, gives $c_3 = 0$.\nSubstituting $c_1=0$ into the third row equation, $c_1 - c_2 = 0$, gives $c_2 = 0$.\nThe only solution is the trivial one, $c_1=c_2=c_3=0$. Therefore, the three column vectors of $S$ are linearly independent.\nThe rank of $S$ is the number of linearly independent columns, so $\\text{rank}(S) = 3$.\nFinally, we calculate the dimension of the left nullspace:\n$$\n\\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top})) = 5 - \\text{rank}(S) = 5 - 3 = 2\n$$\nThere are $2$ linearly independent conservation relations in this network.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4394003"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of conservation, this problem delves into the left nullspace of the stoichiometric matrix.

This is chemically intuitive: for every molecule of $\\mathrm{A}$ consumed, a molecule of $\\mathrm{C}$ is produced (or vice-versa), so the sum of atoms or molecular cores constituting $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{C}$ is conserved.\n\nFor the second basis vector $b_2^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the corresponding conserved moiety is:\n$$ b_2^{\\top}\\mathbf{x} = 0 \\cdot x_{\\mathrm{A}} + 1 \\cdot x_{\\mathrm{B}} + 1 \\cdot x_{\\mathrm{C}} = x_{\\mathrm{B}} + x_{\\mathrm{C}} $$\nThis implies that the total amount of species $\\mathrm{B}$ and species $\\mathrm{C}$ is also constant.

Any steady-state flux distribution $\\mathbf{v}$ must be a scalar multiple of this vector. The interpretation of this mode is as follows:\n- The flux of reaction 1 ($v_1$) must be equal to the flux of reaction 2 ($v_2$).\n- The flux of reaction 3 ($v_3$) must be zero.\n\nTo understand the implication, let us examine the reactions encoded by the columns of $S$. Let the metabolites be $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$.\n- Column 1: $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponds to Reaction 1: $X_1 \\rightarrow X_2$.\n- Column 2: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponds to Reaction 2: $X_2 \\rightarrow X_1$.\n- Column 3: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponds to Reaction 3: $X_3 \\rightarrow X_2$.\n\nThe steady-state condition $v_1 = v_2$ and $v_3 = 0$ means that at steady state, the rate of conversion of $X_1$ to $X_2$ must exactly equal the rate of conversion of $X_2$ back to $X_1$. This forms a futile cycle ($X_1 \\leftrightarrows X_2$) where there is no net production or consumption of either $X_1$ or $X_2$.\n\nThe condition $v_3=0$ is a direct consequence of the system being closed. Reaction 3, $X_3 \\rightarrow X_2$, consumes $X_3$. Since there are no exchange reactions with the environment and no other reaction in the network produces $X_3$, any non-zero flux through reaction 3 ($v_3 > 0$) would lead to a depletion of $X_3$, violating the steady-state assumption. Therefore, for mass to be conserved in this closed system at steady state, reaction 3 must be inactive.\n\nIn conclusion, the basis of the right null space of $S$ defines the core patterns of flux distribution that are compatible with the steady-state constraint. For this network, the only possible non-trivial steady-state behavior is a balanced, internal cycle between two metabolites, while the third reaction, which leads to a net consumption of a metabolite with no source, must be inactive.
