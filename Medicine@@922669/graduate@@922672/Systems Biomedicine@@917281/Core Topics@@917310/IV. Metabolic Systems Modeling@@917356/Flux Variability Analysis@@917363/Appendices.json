This is the FBA problem, formulated as:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{maximize} \\quad  z = c^T v \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad  S v = 0, \\\\\n l \\le v \\le u.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nIn this formulation, $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ represents the vector of reaction fluxes. The equality constraint $S v = 0$ enforces the mass conservation law at steady state, ensuring that the concentrations of internal metabolites remain constant. The inequality constraints $l \\le v \\le u$ define the feasible range for each flux, dictated by thermodynamic feasibility and enzymatic capacity. The optimal value of the objective function is denoted as $z^\\*$, corresponding to an optimal flux distribution $v^\\*$.\n\n**Step 2: Flux Variability Analysis (FVA)**\n\nThe second stage calculates the full range of possible fluxes for each individual reaction $v_j$ (for $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$), under the condition that the network maintains a near-optimal objective value. The problem specifies a near-optimality threshold of $\\alpha = 0.95$. This requirement adds a new constraint to the system:\n$$\nc^T v \\ge \\alpha z^\\*\n$$\nThis constraint ensures that any valid flux distribution $v$ yields an objective value of at least $95\\%$ of the theoretical maximum, $z^\\*$.\n\nTo determine the variability for each reaction $v_j$, two separate LP problems are solved: one for the minimum possible flux and one for the maximum.\n\nFor each reaction index $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n\n1.  **Minimization of $v_j$**: The minimum flux is found by solving:\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    v_j^{\\text{min}} = \\min_{v} \\quad  v_j \\\\\n    \\text{subject to} \\quad  S v = 0, \\\\\n     l \\le v \\le u, \\\\\n     c^T v \\ge \\alpha z^\\*.\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Maximization of $v_j$**: The maximum flux is found by solving:\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    v_j^{\\text{max}} = \\max_{v} \\quad  v_j \\\\\n    \\text{subject to} \\quad  S v = 0, \\\\\n     l \\le v \\le u, \\\\\n     c^T v \\ge \\alpha z^\\*.\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\nThe pair $[v_j^{\\text{min}}, v_j^{\\text{max}}]$ constitutes the flux variability range for reaction $j$. This process must be iterated over all a total of $2n$ LPs are solved for each network.\n\n**Illustrative Example: Test Case 2**\n\nTo demonstrate the method, we consider Test Case $2$:\n- $S = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  -1  0  -1 \\\\ 0  1  -1  0 \\end{bmatrix}$, with $n=4$ reactions.\n- $c = [0, 0, 1, 1]^T$.\n- $l = [0, 0, 0, 0]^T$, $u = [10, 1000, 1000, 8]^T$.\n\nThe steady-state constraints $S v = 0$ yield the relationships:\n$$\nv_1 - v_2 - v_4 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v_2 - v_3 = 0\n$$\nThese simplify to $v_2 = v_3$ and $v_1 = v_2 + v_4$.\n\n**FBA for Test Case 2:**\nThe objective is to maximize $z = c^T v = v_3 + v_4$. Substituting the steady-state relations, $z = v_3 + (v_1 - v_2) = v_3 + (v_1 - v_3) = v_1$. The objective simplifies to maximizing $v_1$. The bounds specify $0 \\le v_1 \\le 10$. Therefore, the optimal objective value is $z^\\* = 10$.\n\n**FVA for Test Case 2:**\nThe near-optimality constraint is $c^T v = v_1 \\ge \\alpha z^\\* = 0.95 \\times 10 = 9.5$.\nThe complete set of constraints for all FVA subproblems is:\n- $v_2 = v_3$\n- $v_1 = v_2 + v_4$\n- $9.5 \\le v_1 \\le 10$\n- $0 \\le v_2 \\le 1000$\n- $0 \\le v_3 \\le 1000$\n- $0 \\le v_4 \\le 8$\n- All fluxes $v_j \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's find the range for flux $v_2$:\n- **Minimize $v_2$**: To minimize $v_2 = v_1 - v_4$, we must select the smallest permissible $v_1$ and the largest permissible $v_4$. We set $v_1 = 9.5$. The constraints $v_1 - v_4 = v_2 \\ge 0$ and $v_4 \\le 8$ imply we can set $v_4=8$. This gives a minimum value $v_2^{\\text{min}} = 9.5 - 8 = 1.5$.\n- **Maximize $v_2$**: To maximize $v_2 = v_1 - v_4$, we must select the largest $v_1$ and smallest $v_4$. We set $v_1 = 10$ and $v_4 = 0$. This gives a maximum value $v_2^{\\text{max}} = 10 - 0 = 10$.\nThus, the variability range for $v_2$ (and $v_3$) is $[1.5, 10.0]$.\n\nThis entire procedure is implemented systematically for all reactions in each of the three test cases using the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function to solve the LPs.

The problem is to maximize $v_4$ subject to the steady-state constraints and the baseline bounds.\n\nFrom the second steady-state equation, we can express the objective flux as:\n$v_4 = v_2 - v_6 + v_7$.\nTo maximize $v_4$, we must maximize $v_2$ and $v_7$ and minimize $v_6$. The bounds are $v_2 \\leq 10$, $v_7 \\leq 2$, and $v_6 \\geq 0$. This suggests a theoretical maximum of $v_4 = 10 - 0 + 2 = 12$. However, the flux $v_4$ itself is constrained by $v_4 \\leq 10$. Let's test if $v_4 = 10$ is achievable.\n\nIf we set $v_4 = 10$, the equation becomes $10 = v_2 - v_6 + v_7$. To achieve this, let's try to set $v_2$ to its maximum, $v_2 = 10$. This gives $10 = 10 - v_6 + v_7$, which simplifies to $v_6 = v_7$.\n\nNow we check consistency with other constraints:\n- The first equation is $v_1 = v_2 + v_3$. With $v_2 = 10$, we have $v_1 = 10 + v_3$. The bound $v_1 \\leq 10$ forces $v_3=0$, which in turn gives $v_1=10$. Both are within their bounds.\n- The third equation is $v_3 - v_5 + v_6 - v_7 = 0$. Using $v_3=0$ and $v_6=v_7$, we get $0 - v_5 + v_7 - v_7 = 0$, which yields $v_5=0$. This is compliant with its bound $0 \\leq v_5 \\leq 10$.\n- The condition $v_6 = v_7$ must also satisfy the bounds $0 \\leq v_6 \\leq 10$ and $0 \\leq v_7 \\leq 2$. This is possible if we choose any value for $v_6$ and $v_7$ such that $v_6=v_7$ and $0 \\leq v_6 \\leq 2$.\nSince a feasible flux distribution exists for $v_4=10$, the optimal objective value is $v_4^{\\star} = 10$.\n\nNext, we perform FVA for flux $v_6$, holding $v_4$ fixed at $v_4^{\\star}=10$. We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values of $v_6$ under these conditions. The constraints are:\n1. $v_1 - v_2 - v_3 = 0$\n2. $v_2 - 10 - v_6 + v_7 = 0 \\implies v_2 = 10 + v_6 - v_7$\n3. $v_3 - v_5 - v_7 + v_6 = 0 \\implies v_3 = v_5 - v_6 + v_7$\n4. The given flux bounds.\n\nFrom $v_2 = 10 + v_6 - v_7$ and the bound $v_2 \\leq 10$, we have $10 + v_6 - v_7 \\leq 10$, which simplifies to $v_6 \\leq v_7$.\nFrom $v_1 = v_2 + v_3 = (10 + v_6 - v_7) + (v_5 - v_6 + v_7) = 10 + v_5$. The bound $v_1 \\leq 10$ implies $10+v_5 \\leq 10$, so $v_5 \\leq 0$. With $v_5 \\geq 0$, we must have $v_5 = 0$.\n\nSo, for the FVA, the system is constrained by $v_5=0$ and $v_6 \\leq v_7$.\n- To find $\\min(v_6)$: The lower bound is $v_6 \\geq 0$. We check if $v_6=0$ is feasible. If $v_6=0$, then we need $0 \\leq v_7$. We can choose any $v_7$ such that $0 \\leq v_7 \\leq 2$. For instance, picking $v_7=1$ gives $v_2 = 10+0-1 = 9$ and $v_3 = 0-0+1=1$, which are both valid. Thus, $\\min(v_6)=0$.\n- To find $\\max(v_6)$: We have the constraints $v_6 \\leq v_7$ and $v_7 \\leq 2$. Together, they imply $v_6 \\leq 2$. Is $v_6=2$ feasible? If $v_6=2$, then we must have $2 \\leq v_7$. Combined with $v_7 \\leq 2$, this forces $v_7=2$. Let's check: $v_2 = 10+2-2=10$ (valid), $v_3 = 0-2+2=0$ (valid). Thus, $\\max(v_6)=2$.\n\nThe FVA range for $v_6$ in the baseline case is $[0, 2]$. The width of this range is $2-0=2$.\n\n**Part 2: Tightened-Bound Case**\n\nThe bounds are now identical to the baseline, except for $v_4$, which is $0 \\leq v_4 \\leq 9$.\nWe again maximize $v_4=v_2-v_6+v_7$. Since the achievable maximum without the bound on $v_4$ was $10$, the new maximum will be limited by the new bound. Thus, the new optimal objective value is $v_4^{\\star} = 9$. This is feasible, as shown by the flux distribution $v=\\{10, 10, 0, 9, 1, 3, 2\\}$, which respects all bounds.\n\nNow we perform FVA on $v_6$ with $v_4$ fixed at $v_4^{\\star}=9$. The constraints are:\n1. $v_1 - v_2 - v_3 = 0$\n2. $v_2 - 9 - v_6 + v_7 = 0 \\implies v_2 = 9 + v_6 - v_7$\n3. $v_3 - v_5 - v_7 + v_6 = 0 \\implies v_3 = v_5 - v_6 + v_7$\n4. All bounds, including the tightened $v_4=9$ bound.\n\nFrom $v_2 = 9 + v_6 - v_7$ and the bound $v_2 \\leq 10$, we deduce $9 + v_6 - v_7 \\leq 10$, which gives $v_6 - v_7 \\leq 1$.\nFrom $v_1 = v_2 + v_3 = (9 + v_6 - v_7) + (v_5 - v_6 + v_7) = 9 + v_5$. The bound $v_1 \\leq 10$ implies $9+v_5 \\leq 10$, yielding $v_5 \\leq 1$.\nWe also need $v_3 \\geq 0$, so $v_5 - v_6 + v_7 \\geq 0$, which means $v_6 \\leq v_5 + v_7$.\n\nTo find the range of $v_6$, we must find its minimum and maximum subject to:\n- $v_6 - v_7 \\leq 1$\n- $v_6 \\leq v_5 + v_7$\n- $0 \\leq v_5 \\leq 1$\n- $0 \\leq v_7 \\leq 2$\n- $v_6 \\geq 0$\n\n- To find $\\min(v_6)$: We can test $v_6=0$. The constraints become $0 - v_7 \\leq 1$ (always true for $v_7 \\geq 0$) and $0 \\leq v_5 + v_7$ (always true for $v_5, v_7 \\geq 0$). We can easily find valid fluxes, e.g., $v_5=0, v_7=1$. This gives $v_2=8$ and $v_3=1$. Thus, $\\min(v_6)=0$.\n- To find $\\max(v_6)$: We need to satisfy $v_6 \\leq v_7 + 1$ and $v_6 \\leq v_5 + v_7$. To get the highest possible value for $v_6$, we should choose the largest possible values for $v_5$ and $v_7$, which are $v_5=1$ and $v_7=2$.\n  - First inequality: $v_6 \\leq 2 + 1 = 3$.\n  - Second inequality: $v_6 \\leq 1 + 2 = 3$.\n  Both constraints suggest an upper limit of $v_6=3$. Is $v_6=3$ feasible? This would require finding $v_5, v_7$ such that $3 \\leq v_7+1$ (i.e., $v_7 \\geq 2$) and $3 \\leq v_5+v_7$ (i.e., $v_5+v_7 \\geq 3$). Given the bounds $v_7 \\leq 2$ and $v_5 \\leq 1$, these inequalities force $v_7=2$ and $v_5=1$. Let's check this point: $v_6=3, v_7=2, v_5=1$.\n   - $v_2 = 9 + 3 - 2 = 10$ (valid).\n   - $v_3 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0$ (valid).\n   - $v_1 = 9+v_5 = 9+1=10$ (valid).\n  So, $\\max(v_6)=3$ is achievable.\n\nThe new FVA range for $v_6$ is $[0, 3]$. The width of this range is $3-0=3$.\n\n**Part 3: Increase in FVA Range Width**\n\nThe width of the FVA range for $v_6$ in the baseline case was $2$.\nThe width of the FVA range for $v_6$ in the tightened-bound case is $3$.\nThe increase in the width is the difference between the two:\nIncrease = (Width in tightened case) - (Width in baseline case) = $3 - 2 = 1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "4343402"}]}
