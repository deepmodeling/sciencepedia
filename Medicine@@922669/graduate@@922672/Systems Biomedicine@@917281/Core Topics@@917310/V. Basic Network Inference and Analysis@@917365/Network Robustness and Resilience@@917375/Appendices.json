This exercise [@problem_id:4367869] provides hands-on practice in deriving the reliability polynomial, a powerful tool that connects a network's structure directly to its resilience. By applying the inclusion-exclusion principle to the system's minimal failure modes, known as cut sets, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how redundancy in network topology translates into a quantifiable measure of robustness against component loss.", "problem": "Consider a small motif representative of redundant signaling in systems biomedicine: a two-terminal undirected network with nodes $S$ (source), $A$, $B$, and $T$ (target), and edges $e_{1}$ between $S$ and $A$, $e_{2}$ between $S$ and $B$, $e_{3}$ between $A$ and $T$, $e_{4}$ between $B$ and $T$, and $e_{5}$ between $A$ and $B$. Each edge functions independently with reliability $p \\in (0,1)$ and fails with probability $1-p$. Two-terminal reliability is defined as the probability that there exists at least one functioning path connecting $S$ to $T$.

Expand your result fully as a polynomial in $p$. In your derivation, explain how the magnitudes and signs of the coefficients arise from inclusion-exclusion over minimal cut sets and interpret what these coefficients imply about structural robustness features such as the number and sizes of minimal cut sets.

It is often more convenient to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, the unreliability or disconnection probability, $Q(p)$, where no such path exists. The reliability is then given by $R(p) = 1 - Q(p)$.\n\nThe network disconnects if and only if all edges in at least one minimal $S$-$T$ cut set fail. A minimal $S$-$T$ cut set is a set of edges whose removal disconnects $S$ from $T$, but no proper subset of which does so. We first identify all minimal cut sets for the given network. The paths from $S$ to $T$ are $S-A-T$, $S-B-T$, $S-A-B-T$, and $S-B-A-T$.\nThe minimal cut sets are:\n1.  $C_1 = \\{e_1, e_2\\}$: This set cuts all connection from the source $S$. Its size is $|C_1|=2$.\n2.  $C_2 = \\{e_3, e_4\\}$: This set cuts all connection to the target $T$. Its size is $|C_2|=2$.\n3.  $C_3 = \\{e_1, e_4, e_5\\}$: This set corresponds to the node partition $\\{S, B\\}$ and $\\{A, T\\}$. Its removal breaks all $S$-$T$ paths.

Its size is $|C_4|=3$.\n\nLet $F_i$ be the event that all edges in the minimal cut set $C_i$ fail. The event of network disconnection, $D$, is the union of these events: $D = F_1 \\cup F_2 \\cup F_3 \\cup F_4$. The probability of this union, $Q(p)$, is calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n$$Q(p) = \\sum_{i} P(F_i) - \\sum_{i<j} P(F_i \\cap F_j) + \\sum_{i<j<k} P(F_i \\cap F_j \\cap F_k) - P(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 \\cap F_4)$$\nLet $q = 1-p$ be the probability of a single edge failing.

The union of any three distinct minimal cut sets includes all 5 edges.\n$\\sum_{i<j<k} P(F_i \\cap F_j \\cap F_k) = 4q^5$.\n\nTerm 4: Quadruple intersection probability. The union of all four minimal cut sets is all 5 edges.\n$P(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 \\cap F_4) = q^5$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the unreliability $Q(p)$:\n$Q(p) = (2q^2 + 2q^3) - (5q^4 + q^5) + (4q^5) - (q^5) = 2q^2 + 2q^3 - 5q^4 + 2q^5$.\n\nThe coefficients in this polynomial of $q$ have a direct structural interpretation. The term $+2q^2$ arises from the two smallest minimal cut sets ($C_1, C_2$), each of size 2. The term $+2q^3$ arises from the next smallest minimal cut sets ($C_3, C_4$), each of size 3. The negative term $-5q^4$ is a correction for overcounting failures of pairs of minimal cut sets whose union has size 4. The final net coefficient of $q^5$ results from the higher-order corrections for intersections involving all 5 edges.\n\nNow, we express $Q(p)$ as a polynomial in $p$ by substituting $q = 1-p$:\n$Q(p) = 2(1-p)^2 + 2(1-p)^3 - 5(1-p)^4 + 2(1-p)^5$\n$Q(p) = 2(1 - 2p + p^2) + 2(1 - 3p + 3p^2 - p^3) - 5(1 - 4p + 6p^2 - 4p^3 + p^4) + 2(1 - 5p + 10p^2 - 10p^3 + 5p^4 - p^5)$\nCollecting terms by powers of $p$:\nConstant term: $2 + 2 - 5 + 2 = 1$\n$p^1$ term: $-4 - 6 + 20 - 10 = 0$\n$p^2$ term: $2 + 6 - 30 + 20 = -2$\n$p^3$ term: $-2 + 20 - 20 = -2$\n$p^4$ term: $-5 + 10 = 5$\n$p^5$ term: $-2$\nSo, $Q(p) = 1 - 2p^2 - 2p^3 + 5p^4 - 2p^5$.\n\nFinally, the reliability polynomial $R(p)$ is:\n$R(p) = 1 - Q(p) = 1 - (1 - 2p^2 - 2p^3 + 5p^4 - 2p^5)$\n$R(p) = 2p^2 + 2p^3 - 5p^4 + 2p^5$.\nThis is the fully expanded reliability polynomial.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{R(p) = 2p^2 + 2p^3 - 5p^4 + 2p^5}\n$$", "id": "4367869"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static structural integrity, a critical aspect of resilience in biological systems is their dynamic response to perturbations.

The minimum $B_{\\text{tot}}$ is found by setting $S = \\delta$ and solving for $B_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$ \\delta \\left( 1 + \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{B}}{(K_{d}^{B} + X^{\\ast})^2} + \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{L}}{(K_{d}^{L} + X^{\\ast})^2} \\right) = \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X^{\\ast}} $$\nRearranging to isolate $B_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$ \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{B}}{(K_{d}^{B} + X^{\\ast})^2} = \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}}}{\\delta(K_{d}^{L} + X^{\\ast})} - 1 - \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{L}}{(K_{d}^{L} + X^{\\ast})^2} $$\nThis gives the analytic expression for the minimum required buffer concentration:\n$$ B_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{(K_{d}^{B} + X^{\\ast})^2}{K_{d}^{B}} \\left[ \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}}}{\\delta(K_{d}^{L} + X^{\\ast})} - 1 - \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{L}}{(K_{d}^{L} + X^{\\ast})^2} \\right] $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given parameters: $L_{\\text{tot}} = 80$ nM, $K_{d}^{L} = 20$ nM, $K_{d}^{B} = 5$ nM, $X^{\\ast} = 120$ nM, and $\\delta = 0.10$.\n\nFirst, calculate the terms inside the square brackets:\n- $\\frac{L_{\\text{tot}}}{\\delta(K_{d}^{L} + X^{\\ast})} = \\frac{80}{0.10 \\times (20 + 120)} = \\frac{80}{14} = \\frac{40}{7}$\n- $\\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{L}}{(K_{d}^{L} + X^{\\ast})^2} = \\frac{80 \\times 20}{(20 + 120)^2} = \\frac{1600}{140^2} = \\frac{1600}{19600} = \\frac{16}{196} = \\frac{4}{49}$\nThe value of the bracketed expression is:\n$$ \\frac{40}{7} - 1 - \\frac{4}{49} = \\frac{280}{49} - \\frac{49}{49} - \\frac{4}{49} = \\frac{227}{49} $$\nNext, calculate the pre-factor:\n$$ \\frac{(K_{d}^{B} + X^{\\ast})^2}{K_{d}^{B}} = \\frac{(5 + 120)^2}{5} = \\frac{125^2}{5} = \\frac{15625}{5} = 3125 \\text{ nM} $$\nFinally, combine these to find $B_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$ B_{\\text{tot}} = 3125 \\times \\frac{227}{49} = \\frac{709375}{49} \\approx 14477.04 \\text{ nM} $$\nRounding the answer to three significant figures gives $14500$ nM.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.45 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "4367911"}]}
