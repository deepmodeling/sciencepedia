A large cohort with phased genomes and matching transcriptomes is used to perform expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping, relating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variation to messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) abundance under the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. The cohort’s measured haplotype frequencies for these two loci are $p_{AB}=0.41$, $p_{Ab}=0.09$, $p_{aB}=0.34$, and $p_{ab}=0.16$, where $p_{XY}$ denotes the population frequency of the haplotype carrying allele $X$ at locus $A/a$ and allele $Y$ at locus $B/b$.

Subsequently, it asks for an interpretation of how the calculated correlation level affects the resolution of expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) fine-mapping.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement. The provided haplotype frequencies are $p_{AB}=0.41$, $p_{Ab}=0.09$, $p_{aB}=0.34$, and $p_{ab}=0.16$. A check confirms their sum is $0.41 + 0.09 + 0.34 + 0.16 = 1.00$, as stipulated. The problem is scientifically grounded in population genetics and statistical genomics, well-posed with all necessary data, and objectively stated. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, starting from foundational definitions as requested.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the marginal allele frequencies from the given haplotype frequencies. The frequency of an allele is the sum of the frequencies of all haplotypes that carry it.\nThe frequency of allele $A$, denoted $p_A$, is:\n$$p_A = p_{AB} + p_{Ab} = 0.41 + 0.09 = 0.50$$\nThe frequency of allele $a$, denoted $p_a$, is:\n$$p_a = p_{aB} + p_{ab} = 0.34 + 0.16 = 0.50$$\nAs a check, $p_A + p_a = 0.50 + 0.50 = 1.00$.\n\nSimilarly, the frequencies for alleles $B$ and $b$ are:\nThe frequency of allele $B$, denoted $p_B$, is:\n$$p_B = p_{AB} + p_{aB} = 0.41 + 0.34 = 0.75$$\nThe frequency of allele $b$, denoted $p_b$, is:\n$$p_b = p_{Ab} + p_{ab} = 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.25$$\nAs a check, $p_B + p_b = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1.00$.\n\nNext, we compute the classical linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficient, $D$. The problem asks for this to be derived from the probabilistic definition of covariance. Let us define two indicator random variables. Let $I_A$ be an indicator variable that is $1$ if a randomly chosen gamete carries allele $A$, and $0$ if it carries allele $a$. Let $I_B$ be an indicator variable that is $1$ if the gamete carries allele $B$, and $0$ if it carries allele $b$.\n\nThe expected values of these variables are the allele frequencies:\n$$E[I_A] = 1 \\cdot P(I_A=1) + 0 \\cdot P(I_A=0) = P(A) = p_A$$\n$$E[I_B] = 1 \\cdot P(I_B=1) + 0 \\cdot P(I_B=0) = P(B) = p_B$$\n\nThe expected value of their product, $E[I_A I_B]$, corresponds to the probability that both indicators are $1$, which is the frequency of the haplotype $AB$:\n$$E[I_A I_B] = P(I_A=1, I_B=1) = p_{AB}$$\n\nThe covariance between these two indicator variables is defined as $\\text{Cov}(I_A, I_B) = E[I_A I_B] - E[I_A]E[I_B]$. This covariance is precisely the definition of the linkage disequilibrium coefficient $D$:\n$$D = p_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nThis formula quantifies the deviation of the observed haplotype frequency from the frequency expected under linkage equilibrium (i.e., statistical independence of the alleles).\n\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$D = 0.41 - (0.50)(0.75) = 0.41 - 0.375 = 0.035$$\nAn alternative, equivalent definition is $D = p_{AB}p_{ab} - p_{Ab}p_{aB}$. Using this as a check:\n$$D = (0.41)(0.16) - (0.09)(0.34) = 0.0656 - 0.0306 = 0.035$$\nThe results are consistent. We round $D$ to $4$ significant figures as requested, which is $0.03500$.\n\nNext, we compute the standardized squared correlation measure, $r^2$. The correlation coefficient $r$ between the indicator variables $I_A$ and $I_B$ is their covariance divided by the product of their standard deviations:\n$$r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(I_A, I_B)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(I_A)\\text{Var}(I_B)}}$$\nFor a Bernoulli (indicator) variable like $I_A$, the variance is $\\text{Var}(I_A) = p_A(1-p_A) = p_A p_a$. Similarly, $\\text{Var}(I_B) = p_B p_b$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $r$, with $\\text{Cov}(I_A, I_B) = D$:\n$$r = \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{p_A p_a p_B p_b}}$$\nThe squared correlation, $r^2$, is therefore:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b}$$\nThis measure ranges from $0$ (perfect equilibrium) to $1$ (perfect disequilibrium, where only two of the four possible haplotypes exist).\n\nUsing our calculated values:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{(0.035)^2}{(0.50)(0.50)(0.75)(0.25)} = \\frac{0.001225}{0.25 \\cdot 0.1875} = \\frac{0.001225}{0.046875} \\approx 0.0261333...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $r^2 = 0.02613$.\n\nFinally, we interpret how this level of correlation affects eQTL fine-mapping. eQTL fine-mapping is the process of identifying the specific, single DNA variant that is mechanistically responsible for variation in gene expression, distinguishing it from other nearby variants that are also statistically associated with expression simply due to LD with the true causal variant.\n\nThe squared correlation coefficient, $r^2$, is the key metric. It quantifies the extent to which the genotype at one locus can predict the genotype at another locus in the population. A high $r^2$ (e.g., $r^2 > 0.8$) indicates strong LD, implying that the two loci are inherited together far more often than expected by chance. A low $r^2$ (e.g., $r^2  0.1$) indicates weak statistical association.\n\nThe fundamental principle of statistical fine-mapping is based on the fact that the strength of an association signal (e.g., a p-value or a test statistic) for a non-causal \"tag\" variant is proportional to the signal at the true causal variant, with the constant of proportionality being precisely $r^2$. Specifically, if variant $C$ is causal for an expression trait and variant $T$ is a non-causal tag, the expected chi-squared statistic for association at $T$ is approximately $\\chi^2_T \\approx r^2_{TC} \\cdot \\chi^2_C$, where $r^2_{TC}$ is the squared correlation between $T$ and $C$.\n\nIn our case, the calculated value is $r^2 \\approx 0.02613$. This is a low level of correlation. If we assume that only one of the two loci, say $A/a$, is truly causal for expression variation, then the association signal observed at the non-causal locus $B/b$ would be expected to be only about $2.6\\%$ as strong as the signal at the causal locus $A/a$. This large difference in signal strength makes it statistically straightforward to distinguish the primary signal at the causal locus from the much weaker, secondary signal at the non-causal locus. A plot of association statistics across the region would show a clear, sharp peak at the causal variant, with surrounding correlated variants showing much lower signals.\n\nTherefore, a low level of LD, as indicated by $r^2 \\approx 0.02613$, significantly simplifies eQTL fine-mapping. The low correlation between the two loci provides the necessary statistical resolution to pinpoint the causal variant with high confidence, as the non-causal variant's association signal is too weak to create ambiguity. Conversely, if $r^2$ were high, the signals would be of comparable magnitude, making it difficult or impossible to resolve the causal locus from association data alone.\n\nThe calculated values for the linkage disequilibrium coefficient and the squared correlation are $D=0.03500$ and $r^2=0.02613$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.03500  0.02613\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4377009"}, {"introduction": "Accurately quantifying gene expression is a central task in transcriptomics, but raw read counts from RNA-sequencing are often misleading.

Derivation of the TPM Expression**\n\nThe fundamental principle provided is that for a given transcript $i$, the expected number of sequencing fragments, $E[k_i]$, is proportional to the product of its molar abundance, $a_i$, and its length, $l_i$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$E[k_i] \\propto a_i \\cdot l_i$$\nAssuming a sufficiently large sequencing library, the observed fragment count $k_i$ is a good estimator for its expectation $E[k_i]$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$k_i \\approx C \\cdot a_i \\cdot l_i$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality that is the same for all transcripts within the same experiment, as it depends on factors like total sequencing depth.\n\nTo estimate the molar abundance $a_i$, we rearrange the expression:\n$$a_i \\propto \\frac{k_i}{l_i}$$\nThis shows that the molar abundance is proportional to the fragment count normalized by the transcript length. This normalized value represents the fragment density on the transcript. Let us define this rate, $r_i$, for each transcript $i$:\n$$r_i = \\frac{k_i}{l_i}$$\nThe quantity $r_i$ is now directly proportional to the molar abundance $a_i$. To obtain a measure of *relative* abundance, we can divide each transcript's rate $r_i$ by the sum of all rates across all $N$ transcripts in the sample:\n$$\\text{Relative abundance of transcript } i = \\frac{r_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} r_j}$$\nThe sum of these relative abundances over all transcripts is, by definition, equal to $1$.\n\nTranscripts Per Million (TPM) is defined as this relative abundance scaled to a total of $10^6$. Therefore, the TPM for transcript $i$ is given by:\n$$\\text{TPM}_i = \\left( \\frac{r_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} r_j} \\right) \\times 10^6$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_i$ back into this equation yields the general expression for TPM whose evaluation is sought:\n$$\\text{TPM}_i = \\left( \\frac{k_i/l_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (k_j/l_j)} \\right) \\times 10^6$$\n\n**2. Computation of TPM Values**\n\nWe are given the following data for three transcripts:\n-   Transcript 1: $l_1 = 1.0$ kb, $k_1 = 600$\n-   Transcript 2: $l_2 = 3.0$ kb, $k_2 = 1200$\n-   Transcript 3: $l_3 = 0.5$ kb, $k_3 = 800$\n\nFirst, we compute the length-normalized rates, $r_i = k_i/l_i$, for each transcript. The unit for these rates is fragments per kilobase.\n$$r_1 = \\frac{k_1}{l_1} = \\frac{600}{1.0} = 600$$\n$$r_2 = \\frac{k_2}{l_2} = \\frac{1200}{3.0} = 400$$\n$$r_3 = \\frac{k_3}{l_3} = \\frac{800}{0.5} = 1600$$\n\nNext, we compute the sum of these rates, which will serve as the normalization factor. In this problem, our sample consists of these three transcripts, so $N=3$.\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{3} r_j = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 600 + 400 + 1600 = 2600$$\n\nNow, we can compute the TPM value for each transcript using the derived formula:\n$$\\text{TPM}_1 = \\left( \\frac{r_1}{\\sum r_j} \\right) \\times 10^6 = \\left( \\frac{600}{2600} \\right) \\times 10^6 \\approx 230769.23$$\n$$\\text{TPM}_2 = \\left( \\frac{r_2}{\\sum r_j} \\right) \\times 10^6 = \\left( \\frac{400}{2600} \\right) \\times 10^6 \\approx 153846.15$$\n$$\\text{TPM}_3 = \\left( \\frac{r_3}{\\sum r_j} \\right) \\times 10^6 = \\left( \\frac{1600}{2600} \\right) \\times 10^6 \\approx 615384.62$$\n\nRounding these values to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\\text{TPM}_1 = 2.308 \\times 10^5$$\n$$\\text{TPM}_2 = 1.538 \\times 10^5$$\n$$\\text{TPM}_3 = 6.154 \\times 10^5$$\nThe sum of these rounded values is $230800 + 153800 + 615400 = 1000000 = 10^6$, confirming the consistency of the rounding.\n\n**3. Explanation of Length Bias Correction**\n\nThe computation starkly illustrates how normalization by transcript length corrects for the inherent size bias in raw RNA-seq fragment counts.\n\nFirst, consider the abundance hierarchy implied by the raw counts ($k_i$):\n$$k_2 = 1200 > k_3 = 800 > k_1 = 600$$\nBased on this unnormalized data, one would erroneously conclude that transcript 2 is the most abundant, followed by transcript 3, and then transcript 1.\n\nNow, consider the abundance hierarchy implied by the TPM values, which represent relative molar abundance:\n$$\\text{TPM}_3 \\approx 6.15 \\times 10^5 > \\text{TPM}_1 \\approx 2.31 \\times 10^5 > \\text{TPM}_2 \\approx 1.54 \\times 10^5$$\nThe corrected ranking of molar abundance is $a_3 > a_1 > a_2$, which is a complete inversion of the hierarchy suggested by the counts for transcripts 1 and 2, and a reordering for all three.\n\nThis discrepancy arises because raw counts conflate molar abundance ($a_i$) and transcript length ($l_i$). A long transcript provides a larger target for random fragmentation, leading to a higher fragment count for the same molar abundance compared to a shorter transcript.\n-   **Transcript 2** ($l_2 = 3.0$ kb) is very long. Its high count ($k_2=1200$) is therefore an over-representation of its actual molar abundance. Dividing by its large length corrects for this, revealing it to be the least abundant transcript in the sample.\n-   **Transcript 3** ($l_3 = 0.5$ kb) is very short. Despite this, it generated a high count ($k_3=800$). This implies a very high molar abundance is necessary to produce so many fragments from such a small target. Normalizing by its short length correctly scales its value upwards, revealing it to be, by a significant margin, the most abundant transcript.\n\nIn essence, the normalization step $k_i/l_i$ decouples the contribution of length from the observed signal, yielding a quantity ($r_i$) that is proportional to the true biological quantity of interest: the molar abundance ($a_i$). The subsequent scaling to TPM provides a standardized metric for comparing relative expression levels across different transcripts and samples. The interpretation of the TPM values is as follows: if one were to sample a population of $10^6$ total mRNA molecules with the same relative composition as the experimental sample, one would expect to find approximately $230,800$ molecules of transcript 1, $153,800$ molecules of transcript 2, and $615,400$ molecules of transcript 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.308 \\times 10^5  1.538 \\times 10^5  6.154 \\times 10^5 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4377050"}, {"introduction": "Systems biology aims to create predictive models of cellular behavior by integrating information across multiple 'omics layers.

Formulation of the FBA linear program.\n\nThe FBA problem is formulated as a linear program (LP), which consists of an objective function to be optimized, subject to a set of linear constraints.\nThe objective is to maximize biomass formation, which is represented by the flux $v_{3}$. The objective vector is given as $c = (0, 0, 1)^{\\top}$. The objective function is $Z = c^{\\top}v$.\n$$\n\\text{Maximize } Z = c^{\\top}v = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\\\ v_{3} \\end{pmatrix} = v_{3}\n$$\nThe constraints are the stoichiometric mass balance equations and the flux capacity bounds.\nThe full LP is formulated as:\n\nMaximize $Z = v_{3}$\nSubject to:\n-   Stoichiometric constraints:\n    $$v_{1} - v_{2} = 0$$\n    $$2v_{2} - v_{3} = 0$$\n-   Flux bounds: $l \\leq v \\leq u$, where $l = (0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$ and $u = (u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3})^{\\top}$. These inequalities are:\n    $$0 \\leq v_{1} \\leq u_{1}$$\n    $$0 \\leq v_{2} \\leq u_{2}$$\n    $$0 \\leq v_{3} \\leq u_{3}$$\n\n3.  Analytical solution of the linear program.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximal value of $v_{3}$ that satisfies all the constraints. We can use the stoichiometric constraints to express all fluxes in terms of a single flux, for instance $v_{3}$.\nFrom the first stoichiometric constraint, $v_{1} - v_{2} = 0$, we have:\n$$v_{1} = v_{2}$$\nFrom the second stoichiometric constraint, $2v_{2} - v_{3} = 0$, we have:\n$$v_{2} = \\frac{v_{3}}{2}$$\nCombining these results, we can express all fluxes in terms of $v_{3}$:\n$$v_{1} = v_{2} = \\frac{v_{3}}{2}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the flux bound inequalities.\nThe lower bounds ($v_{i} \\geq 0$) are automatically satisfied if $v_{3} \\geq 0$. Maximizing $v_{3}$ will yield a non-negative result.\nWe consider the upper bounds:\n-   For $v_{1}$: $v_{1} \\leq u_{1} \\implies \\frac{v_{3}}{2} \\leq u_{1} \\implies v_{3} \\leq 2u_{1}$\n-   For $v_{2}$: $v_{2} \\leq u_{2} \\implies \\frac{v_{3}}{2} \\leq u_{2} \\implies v_{3} \\leq 2u_{2}$\n-   For $v_{3}$: $v_{3} \\leq u_{3}$\n\nTo maximize $v_{3}$, it must satisfy all three of these upper bound constraints simultaneously. Therefore, the value of $v_{3}$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of these three derived bounds.\n$$v_{3} \\leq \\min(2u_{1}, 2u_{2}, u_{3})$$\nThe maximal value of $v_{3}$ is precisely this minimum, as any larger value would violate at least one of the constraints.\n$$v_{3, \\max} = \\min(2u_{1}, 2u_{2}, u_{3})$$\nThis expression represents the maximal biomass production rate. The units are given as context (e.g., $\\text{mmol gDW}^{-1} \\text{h}^{-1}$), but the analytical expression is independent of the choice of units.\n\n4.  Biological interpretation of the objective function.\n\nThe objective of maximizing biomass formation (i.e., growth rate) is biologically plausible under specific conditions, often assumed for microorganisms in laboratory settings.\n\n-   **Plausibility of Maximizing Biomass**: This objective function is most appropriate for cells in a state of rapid proliferation, such as bacteria in the exponential growth phase in a nutrient-rich environment, or aggressively dividing cancer cells. In these scenarios, the evolutionary driving force is to replicate as fast as possible. The cellular machinery is geared towards converting available nutrients into the building blocks (amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, etc.) required to synthesize a new cell.\n    -   **'Omics' evidence**: Genomics might reveal gene duplications for key metabolic enzymes. Transcriptomics would show high expression levels of genes involved in nutrient uptake, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and amino acid biosynthesis. Proteomics would confirm high concentrations of the corresponding enzymes. Metabolomics would show high pools of biomass precursors. These multi-omics data together would support the hypothesis that the cell's metabolism is optimized for growth. The reaction bounds $u_{i}$ are often estimated from proteomics data (enzyme capacity) and metabolomics data (substrate availability).\n\n-   **Alternative Objectives**: In other physiological states, maximizing biomass is not a realistic objective.\n    -   **ATP Maximization**: In nutrient-scarce environments or for non-growing, terminally differentiated cells, the primary goal is survival and maintenance. This requires efficient energy (ATP) production to maintain ion gradients, repair macromolecules, and sustain cellular functions. The objective would be to maximize the flux through an ATP-producing reaction.\n    -   **Minimization of Total Flux**: This objective reflects a cellular drive for maximum metabolic efficiency, achieving a required output (e.g., a certain amount of ATP production) while minimizing the total enzymatic \"cost\" (sum of all flux magnitudes). This could be relevant in stable, homeostatic conditions where resource conservation is paramount.\n    -   **'Omics' context**: The choice of an appropriate objective function is context-dependent and can be guided by 'omics' data. For instance, transcriptomic data indicating a stress response and upregulation of catabolic pathways might suggest ATP maximization is a more suitable objective than biomass production. Thus, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is crucial for building predictive metabolic models that accurately reflect the cellular state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\min(2u_{1}, 2u_{2}, u_{3})}\n$$", "id": "4377028"}]}
