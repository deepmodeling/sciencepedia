A complete solution is provided below.\n\nThe first step is to nondimensionalize the given ODE. We introduce the dimensionless concentration $x$ and dimensionless time $\\tau$ according to the specified scales:\n$$ x = \\frac{X}{K} \\implies X = Kx $$\n$$ \\tau = k_d t \\implies t = \\frac{\\tau}{k_d} $$\nWe must re-express the derivative $\\frac{dX}{dt}$ in terms of the new variables. Using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = \\frac{dX}{d\\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} $$\nFrom the definitions, $\\frac{dX}{d\\tau} = K \\frac{dx}{d\\tau}$ and $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = k_d$. Substituting these gives:\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = K k_d \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} $$\nNow we substitute the expressions for $X$ and $\\frac{dX}{dt}$ into the original ODE:\n$$ K k_d \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = v_{\\max} \\frac{(Kx)^{n}}{K^{n} + (Kx)^{n}} - k_{d}(Kx) $$\nWe simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$ K k_d \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = v_{\\max} \\frac{K^{n}x^{n}}{K^{n}(1 + x^{n})} - k_{d}Kx $$\n$$ K k_d \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = v_{\\max} \\frac{x^{n}}{1 + x^{n}} - k_{d}Kx $$\nTo obtain the final dimensionless form, we divide the entire equation by $Kk_d$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = \\frac{v_{\\max}}{Kk_d} \\frac{x^{n}}{1 + x^{n}} - x $$\nThis dimensionless ODE contains a single composite parameter group, which we define as the dimensionless production strength $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{v_{\\max}}{Kk_d} $$\nThe dimensionless equation is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = \\alpha \\frac{x^{n}}{1 + x^{n}} - x $$\nThe equilibrium locations (fixed points) and their stability are controlled by the minimal set of dimensionless groups, which are the production strength $\\alpha$ and the Hill coefficient $n$.\n\nEquilibria, denoted by $x^*$, are found by setting the rate of change to zero, $\\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = 0$:\n$$ f(x^*) = \\alpha \\frac{(x^*)^{n}}{1 + (x^*)^{n}} - x^* = 0 $$\nOne trivial equilibrium is $x^* = 0$. Non-zero equilibria are solutions to:\n$$ \\alpha \\frac{(x^*)^{n}}{1 + (x^*)^{n}} = x^* $$\nAssuming $x^* \\neq 0$, we can divide by $x^*$:\n$$ \\alpha \\frac{(x^*)^{n-1}}{1 + (x^*)^{n}} = 1 $$\nA saddle-node bifurcation occurs when the number of equilibria changes. At this critical point, two fixed points (one stable and one unstable) merge and annihilate. This corresponds to a state where the system not only satisfies the equilibrium condition $f(x)=0$, but where the fixed point is also marginally stable, i.e., the slope of the function $f(x)$ is zero, $f'(x)=0$.\n\nWe calculate the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\alpha \\frac{x^{n}}{1 + x^{n}} - x \\right) $$\nUsing the quotient rule for the first term:\n$$ f'(x) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{nx^{n-1}(1+x^n) - x^n(nx^{n-1})}{(1+x^n)^2} \\right) - 1 $$\n$$ f'(x) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{nx^{n-1}}{(1+x^n)^2} \\right) - 1 $$\nAt the bifurcation point, we have a system of two equations for the critical concentration $x_c$ and the critical production strength $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ (1) \\quad \\alpha_c \\frac{x_c^n}{1+x_c^n} - x_c = 0 $$\n$$ (2) \\quad \\frac{\\alpha_c n x_c^{n-1}}{(1+x_c^n)^2} - 1 = 0 $$\nFrom equation (1), for a non-zero fixed point ($x_c \\neq 0$):\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{x_c(1+x_c^n)}{x_c^n} = \\frac{1+x_c^n}{x_c^{n-1}} $$\nFrom equation (2):\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{(1+x_c^n)^2}{n x_c^{n-1}} $$\nEquating these two expressions for $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ \\frac{1+x_c^n}{x_c^{n-1}} = \\frac{(1+x_c^n)^2}{n x_c^{n-1}} $$\nSince we are looking for non-trivial solutions, $x_c0$. The term $(1+x_c^n)/x_c^{n-1}$ is non-zero, so we can divide both sides by it:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{1+x_c^n}{n} $$\nSolving for $x_c^n$:\n$$ n = 1 + x_c^n \\implies x_c^n = n-1 $$\nThis gives the critical concentration at which the bifurcation occurs:\n$$ x_c = (n-1)^{1/n} $$\nThis real, positive solution exists because the problem specifies $n  1$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $x_c^n$ back into one of the equations for $\\alpha_c$. Using $\\alpha_c = \\frac{1+x_c^n}{x_c^{n-1}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{1+(n-1)}{x_c^{n-1}} = \\frac{n}{x_c^{n-1}} $$\nWe need to express $x_c^{n-1}$ in terms of $n$. We can write $x_c^{n-1}$ as $(x_c^n)^{(n-1)/n}$:\n$$ x_c^{n-1} = ((n-1))^{ (n-1)/n } $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}} $$\nThis is the critical value of the nondimensional production strength at which the system undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n}{(n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}}}$$", "id": "4387838"}, {"introduction": "Positive feedback loops are ubiquitous in biology, often creating switch-like behaviors and memory.

Since $K_d  0$ and the concentration $x_1 \\ge 0$, the term $(K_d + x_1)$ is strictly positive, so this operation does not introduce extraneous solutions.\n$$ (K_d + x_1)(k_a x_1 + k_b)(T - x_1) - V_d x_1 = 0 $$\nWe now expand the polynomial. First, we expand the product of the last two factors:\n$$ (k_a x_1 + k_b)(T - x_1) = T k_a x_1 - k_a x_1^2 + T k_b - k_b x_1 = -k_a x_1^2 + (T k_a - k_b) x_1 + T k_b $$\nNext, we multiply this quadratic by $(K_d + x_1)$:\n$$ (K_d + x_1) \\left( -k_a x_1^2 + (T k_a - k_b) x_1 + T k b \\right) $$\n$$ = -K_d k_a x_1^2 + K_d(T k_a - k_b) x_1 + K_d T k_b - k_a x_1^3 + (T k_a - k_b) x_1^2 + T k_b x_1 $$\nCombining this with the final term $-V_d x_1$ from the main equation and grouping terms by powers of $x_1$:\n$$ (-k_a) x_1^3 + \\left( -K_d k_a + T k_a - k_b \\right) x_1^2 + \\left( K_d T k_a - K_d k_b + T k_b - V_d \\right) x_1 + (K_d T k_b) = 0 $$\nThis is the desired univariate polynomial in $x_1$. Let's rewrite it in the standard form $Ax_1^3 + Bx_1^2 + Cx_1 + D = 0$ by multiplying by $-1$:\n$$ k_a x_1^3 + \\left( k_b - k_a(T - K_d) \\right) x_1^2 + \\left( V_d - K_d T k_a + K_d k_b - T k_b \\right) x_1 - K_d T k_b = 0 $$\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values: $T = 10$, $k_a = 0.05$, $k_b = 0.10$, $V_d = 1.0$, and $K_d = 2.0$.\n\nThe coefficient of $x_1^3$ is $A = k_a = 0.05$.\n\nThe coefficient of $x_1^2$ is $B = k_b - k_a(T - K_d) = 0.10 - 0.05(10 - 2.0) = 0.10 - 0.05(8) = 0.10 - 0.40 = -0.30$.\n\nThe coefficient of $x_1$ is $C = V_d - K_d T k_a + K_d k_b - T k_b = 1.0 - (2.0)(10)(0.05) + (2.0)(0.10) - (10)(0.10) = 1.0 - 1.0 + 0.20 - 1.0 = -0.80$.\n\nThe constant term is $D = -K_d T k_b = -(2.0)(10)(0.10) = -2.0$.\n\nThe polynomial equation is:\n$$ 0.05 x_1^3 - 0.30 x_1^2 - 0.80 x_1 - 2.0 = 0 $$\nTo simplify the search for roots, we can multiply the entire equation by $20$:\n$$ x_1^3 - 6 x_1^2 - 16 x_1 - 40 = 0 $$\nLet $P(x_1) = x_1^3 - 6 x_1^2 - 16 x_1 - 40$. We must find the roots of this polynomial. According to Descartes' Rule of Signs, the sequence of signs of the coefficients is $(+, -, -, -)$. There is one sign change, so there is exactly one positive real root. This root is our candidate for the physically admissible steady state, $x_1^{\\ast}$.\n\nWe must verify that this root lies within the physical range $0 \\le x_1^{\\ast} \\le T = 10$.\nLet's evaluate the polynomial at the boundaries of this range:\n$P(0) = 0^3 - 6(0)^2 - 16(0) - 40 = -40$.\n$P(10) = 10^3 - 6(10)^2 - 16(10) - 40 = 1000 - 600 - 160 - 40 = 1000 - 800 = 200$.\nSince $P(0)  0$ and $P(10)  0$, and $P(x_1)$ is a continuous function, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that the single positive real root lies in the interval $(0, 10)$. Therefore, this root is the unique, physically admissible steady-state concentration.\n\nTo find the numerical value of the root, we use a numerical solver (e.g., Newton's method or a computational tool). Solving the equation $x_1^3 - 6 x_1^2 - 16 x_1 - 40 = 0$ for its real root yields:\n$$ x_1 \\approx 8.453163... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ x_1^{\\ast} \\approx 8.453 $$\nThe unit for this concentration is micromolar.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.453}\n$$", "id": "4387880"}]}
