The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Steady-State Quantities\n\nFirst, we define the Laplace transforms of the input signals. The reference signal is $r(t) = R\\,u(t)$, so its Laplace transform is $R(s) = \\frac{R}{s}$. The disturbance signal is $d(t) = D\\,u(t)$, and its transform is $D(s) = \\frac{D}{s}$.\n\nThe steady-state value of a time-domain signal $f(t)$ can be found from its Laplace transform $F(s)$ using the Final Value Theorem (FVT), provided the limit exists: $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} f(t) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} sF(s)$. As established in the validation, the FVT is applicable for all required calculations.\n\n**1. Closed-Loop Steady-State Error to Reference ($e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{CL}}$)**\n\nIn the closed-loop configuration, the controller action is $U(s) = K E(s)$, where the error is $E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$. The plant output is perturbed by the disturbance, so the measured output is $Y(s) = G(s)U(s) + D(s)$.\nSubstituting $U(s)$, we get $Y(s) = G(s)K E(s) + D(s) = G(s)K(R(s) - Y(s)) + D(s)$.\nSolving for $Y(s)$:\n$Y(s)(1+G(s)K) = G(s)K R(s) + D(s)$\n$Y(s) = \\frac{G(s)K}{1+G(s)K} R(s) + \\frac{1}{1+G(s)K} D(s)$.\n\nThe error is $E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$. Substituting the expression for $Y(s)$:\n$E(s) = R(s) - \\left( \\frac{G(s)K}{1+G(s)K} R(s) + \\frac{1}{1+G(s)K} D(s) \\right)$\n$E(s) = \\left(1 - \\frac{G(s)K}{1+G(s)K}\\right) R(s) - \\frac{1}{1+G(s)K} D(s)$\n$E(s) = \\frac{1}{1+G(s)K} R(s) - \\frac{1}{1+G(s)K} D(s)$.\n\nFor this part, we consider $d(t) \\equiv 0$, so $D(s)=0$. The error is $E(s) = \\frac{1}{1+G(s)K} R(s)$.\nSubstituting $G(s)=\\frac{k}{s+a}$ and $R(s)=\\frac{R}{s}$:\n$E(s) = \\frac{1}{1+K\\frac{k}{s+a}} \\frac{R}{s} = \\frac{s+a}{s+a+Kk} \\frac{R}{s}$.\n\nNow, we apply the FVT:\n$e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} sE(s) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{s+a}{s+a+Kk} \\frac{R}{s} \\right) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{R(s+a)}{s+a+Kk}$.\n$e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\frac{R(0+a)}{0+a+Kk} = \\frac{Ra}{a+Kk}$.\n\n**2. Open-Loop Steady-State Error to Reference ($e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{OL}}$)**\n\nIn the open-loop configuration, the controller action is $U(s) = K R(s)$. The output is $Y(s) = G(s)U(s) + D(s) = G(s)K R(s) + D(s)$.\nFor this part, we have $d(t) \\equiv 0$, so $D(s)=0$. The output is $Y(s) = G(s)K R(s)$.\nThe error is defined as $e(t) = r(t)-y(t)$, so its transform is $E(s) = R(s)-Y(s)$.\n$E(s) = R(s) - G(s)K R(s) = (1-G(s)K)R(s)$.\nSubstituting $G(s)=\\frac{k}{s+a}$ and $R(s)=\\frac{R}{s}$:\n$E(s) = \\left(1 - K\\frac{k}{s+a}\\right) \\frac{R}{s} = \\frac{s+a-Kk}{s+a} \\frac{R}{s}$.\n\nApplying the FVT:\n$e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{OL}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} sE(s) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{s+a-Kk}{s+a} \\frac{R}{s} \\right) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{R(s+a-Kk)}{s+a}$.\n$e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{OL}} = \\frac{R(0+a-Kk)}{0+a} = \\frac{R(a-Kk)}{a}$.\n\n**3. Closed-Loop Steady-State Output Deviation due to Disturbance ($\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{CL}}$)**\n\nWe return to the closed-loop output expression: $Y(s) = \\frac{G(s)K}{1+G(s)K} R(s) + \\frac{1}{1+G(s)K} D(s)$.\nFor this part, we consider $r(t) \\equiv 0$, so $R(s)=0$. The output is solely due to the disturbance:\n$Y(s) = \\frac{1}{1+G(s)K} D(s)$.\nThis quantity represents the output deviation from zero due to the disturbance.\nSubstituting $G(s)=\\frac{k}{s+a}$ and $D(s)=\\frac{D}{s}$:\n$Y(s) = \\frac{1}{1+K\\frac{k}{s+a}} \\frac{D}{s} = \\frac{s+a}{s+a+Kk} \\frac{D}{s}$.\n\nApplying the FVT to find the steady-state output deviation:\n$\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{s+a}{s+a+Kk} \\frac{D}{s} \\right) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{D(s+a)}{s+a+Kk}$.\n$\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\frac{D(0+a)}{0+a+Kk} = \\frac{Da}{a+Kk}$.\n\n**4. Open-Loop Steady-State Output Deviation due to Disturbance ($\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{OL}}$)**\n\nWe use the open-loop output expression: $Y(s) = G(s)K R(s) + D(s)$.\nFor this part, $r(t) \\equiv 0$, which implies $R(s)=0$. The output becomes:\n$Y(s) = D(s)$.\nSubstituting $D(s) = \\frac{D}{s}$:\n$Y(s) = \\frac{D}{s}$.\n\nApplying the FVT to find the steady-state output deviation:\n$\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{OL}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{D}{s} \\right) = D$.\nThis result is intuitive: in an open-loop system with no feedback, the controller is unaware of the output disturbance, which therefore passes through to the output unattenuated.\n\nThe four derived quantities are:\n- $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\frac{Ra}{a+Kk}$\n- $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{OL}} = \\frac{R(a-Kk)}{a}$\n- $\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\frac{Da}{a+Kk}$\n- $\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{ss}}^{\\mathrm{OL}} = D$\n\nThese are assembled into a single row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{Ra}{a+Kk} & \\frac{R(a-Kk)}{a} & \\frac{Da}{a+Kk} & D \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4342449"}, {"introduction": "While simple proportional feedback reduces error, it often cannot eliminate it entirely.

The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding how the incoherent FFL can \"mask\" the bistability generated by the positive feedback on $Y$. We begin by analyzing the steady-state condition for $Y$, which is given by setting $\\frac{dY}{dt}=0$ in its governing ODE. This gives the $Y$-nullcline:\n$$\n\\delta_Y Y = \\alpha_Y\\,h_a(X;K_X,n_X)\\,h_a(Y;K_Y,n_Y)\\,h_r(Z;K_Z,m_Z)\n$$\nUnder the quasi-steady-state assumption for $Z$, we can substitute $Z$ with $Z^\\ast(X)$, and using the provided definition $\\sigma(X) = h_r(Z^\\ast(X);K_Z,m_Z)$, we get:\n$$\n\\delta_Y Y = \\left[ \\alpha_Y\\,h_a(X;K_X,n_X)\\,\\sigma(X) \\right] \\cdot h_a(Y;K_Y,n_Y)\n$$\nFor a fixed input level of $X$, the steady-state values of $Y$ are the intersection points of two functions of $Y$:\n1.  The degradation term, $f_{loss}(Y) = \\delta_Y Y$, which is a straight line through the origin with slope $\\delta_Y$.\n2.  The production term, $f_{prod}(Y) = S(X) \\cdot h_a(Y;K_Y,n_Y)$, where $S(X) = \\alpha_Y\\,h_a(X;K_X,n_X)\\,\\sigma(X)$ is the effective synthesis rate that depends on the input $X$. The function $f_{prod}(Y)$ has a sigmoidal (S-shaped) dependence on $Y$ due to the self-activating Hill function $h_a(Y;K_Y,n_Y)$, provided the Hill coefficient $n_Y > 1$.\n\nBistability occurs when, for a given $X$, the sigmoidal production curve intersects the linear degradation line at three points (two stable, one unstable). This requires the sigmoidal curve to be sufficiently steep (high $n_Y$) and have a sufficiently high plateau level, which is determined by the effective synthesis rate $S(X)$.\n\nThe problem posits that the incoherent FFL *masks* this bistability. Let's analyze how. The effective synthesis rate is:\n$$\nS(X) = \\alpha_Y \\cdot \\underbrace{h_a(X;K_X,n_X)}_{\\text{Activation}} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\sigma(X)}_{\\text{Attenuation}}\n$$\nThe direct activation term $h_a(X;K_X,n_X)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $X$, increasing from $0$ to $1$.\nThe attenuation term $\\sigma(X) = h_r(Z^\\ast(X);K_Z,m_Z)$ depends on $Z^\\ast(X) = \\frac{\\alpha_Z}{\\delta_Z}\\,h_a(X;K_X,n_X)$. Since $Z^\\ast(X)$ is an increasing function of $X$, and $h_r$ is a repressing (decreasing) function, $\\sigma(X)$ is a monotonically *decreasing* function of $X$, decreasing from $1$ (when $X=0$) towards $0$ (for large $X$).\n\nThe product of an increasing function ($h_a$) and a decreasing function ($\\sigma$) results in a non-monotonic, pulse-like dependence of $S(X)$ on $X$. $S(X)$ starts at $0$, increases to a peak, and then decreases. The masking effect can occur in two ways:\n1.  The attenuation by $\\sigma(X)$ might be so strong that the peak value of $S(X)$ is never high enough to push the system into the bistable regime. The production curve $f_{prod}(Y)$ never becomes high enough to allow three intersections with $f_{loss}(Y)$.\n2.  Even if the peak of $S(X)$ enters the bistable region, the non-monotonic shape complicates or prevents the observation of a simple hysteresis loop during a monotonic ramp-up of $X$.\n\nTo \"unmask\" the bistability, we must remove the attenuating effect of the indirect arm of the FFL. The goal is to make the effective synthesis rate a simple, monotonic function of the input $X$, allowing for a clean test of hysteresis. This is achieved by eliminating the repression sourced from $Z$. Mathematically, we want to force the attenuation factor $\\sigma(X) = h_r(Z^\\ast(X);K_Z,m_Z)$ to be equal to $1$ for all values of $X$.\n\nThe repressing Hill function $h_r(v;K,m) = \\frac{K^m}{K^m + v^m}$ equals $1$ if and only if its argument $v=0$. In our case, the argument is $Z$ (or $Z^\\ast(X)$ in the steady-state view). Thus, we need to ensure that the concentration of the repressor $Z$ that acts on the $Y$ promoter is always zero, or that the promoter is insensitive to it. There are two primary genetic perturbations to achieve this:\n1.  Delete gene $Z$. This sets its production rate $\\alpha_Z = 0$, which ensures $Z(t) = 0$ for all time (assuming $Z(0)=0$). This makes the argument of the repressor function zero, so $h_r(0; K_Z, m_Z) = 1$.\n2.  Mutate the operator sites for $Z$ in the promoter of gene $Y$. This makes the promoter \"blind\" to the repressor $Z$. Effectively, the term $h_r(Z; K_Z, m_Z)$ becomes constant and equal to $1$, as there is no repression regardless of the concentration of $Z$.\n\nIn either case, the attenuation factor $\\sigma(X)$ is fixed at $1$. The $Y$-nullcline simplifies to:\n$$\n\\delta_Y Y = \\left[ \\alpha_Y\\,h_a(X;K_X,n_X) \\right] \\cdot h_a(Y;K_Y,n_Y)\n$$\nThe effective synthesis rate becomes $S_{new}(X) = \\alpha_Y\\,h_a(X;K_X,n_X)$. This is a monotonically increasing function of $X$. If the underlying positive feedback loop (parameters $n_Y, K_Y, \\alpha_Y, \\delta_Y$) is capable of bistability, ramping $X$ up from $0$ will monotonically increase $S_{new}(X)$ from $0$ to $\\alpha_Y$. This sweep of the synthesis rate will cross the bistable region, if it exists, and a slow up/down ramp of $X$ will reveal a classic hysteresis loop. This perturbation is therefore necessary and sufficient to isolate the $X$-driven positive feedback module and test for its intrinsic capacity for bistability.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Break the $X \\to Z \\dashv Y$ indirect arm by deleting gene $Z$ or by mutating the $Z$ operator sites in the $Y$ promoter so that $Z$ cannot repress $Y$, while preserving $Y$’s self-activation; then perform a slow $X$ up/down ramp to test for hysteresis.**\nThis option describes precisely the two perturbations identified in the derivation above. Both methods successfully remove the repressive attenuation from the indirect FFL arm by setting the term $h_r(Z;...)$ to $1$. This unmasks the direct activation of the positive feedback loop by $X$, allowing its potential bistability to be observed via a hysteresis experiment. This perturbation is both necessary (the masking must be removed) and sufficient (it allows the definitive test).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Disable $Y$’s self-activation by mutating its auto-activation site, leaving the incoherent FFL intact; then perform a slow $X$ up/down ramp to test for hysteresis.**\nThis perturbation removes the positive feedback loop ($Y \\to Y$). Positive feedback is a necessary condition for the kind of bistability described (where the production curve is sigmoidal). Without the $h_a(Y;K_Y,n_Y)$ term, the steady-state equation for $Y$ becomes linear in $Y$, admitting only a single steady state for any given $X$. Therefore, bistability and hysteresis are impossible. This action is antithetical to the stated goal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Constitutively overexpress $Z$ from an $X$-independent strong promoter, leaving $Z$ repression of $Y$ intact; then perform a slow $X$ up/down ramp to test for hysteresis.**\nThis perturbation forces the concentration of the repressor $Z$ to a high, constant level. Consequently, the repression term $h_r(Z; K_Z, m_Z)$ will be a very small constant close to zero. This will clamp the effective synthesis rate $S(X)$ at a very low level for all values of $X$. Instead of unmasking bistability, this is likely to completely shut down expression of $Y$, locking it in the \"off\" state. This does not reveal bistability; it ensures monostability at $Y \\approx 0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Remove the direct activation branch $X \\to Y$ while leaving $X \\to Z \\dashv Y$ and $Y$ self-activation intact; then perform a slow $X$ up/down ramp to test for hysteresis.**\nThis perturbation removes the direct activation of $Y$ by $X$. The system is now driven by $X$ only through the repressive arm. The dynamics would be $\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\alpha_Y'\\,h_a(Y;K_Y,n_Y)\\,h_r(Z;K_Z,m_Z) - \\delta_Y\\,Y$, where $\\alpha_Y'$ is some basal/constitutive maximal rate and $Z$ is still activated by $X$. Increasing $X$ would *decrease* the synthesis of $Y$. While this new circuit might exhibit bistability, this experiment does not \"unmask\" the behavior of the original incoherent FFL. It fundamentally changes the circuit topology into a different one (a simple repressive cascade with positive feedback). The goal is to reveal the bistability latent in the original circuit, which is masked by the FFL's repressive arm. This option removes the activating arm, not the masking arm.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4342452"}]}
