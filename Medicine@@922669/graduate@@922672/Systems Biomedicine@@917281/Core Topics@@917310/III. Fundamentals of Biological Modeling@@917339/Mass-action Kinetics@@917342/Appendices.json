For this extremum to be a maximum, the second derivative $\\frac{d^2[B]}{dt^2}$ must be negative at $t=t^{\\ast}$.\nAt $t=t^{\\ast}$, we have $\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_1[A] - k_2[B] = 0$.\nThe second derivative is $\\frac{d^2[B]}{dt^2} = k_1\\frac{d[A]}{dt} - k_2\\frac{d[B]}{dt}$. At $t=t^{\\ast}$, this simplifies to $\\frac{d^2[B]}{dt^2}|_{t^{\\ast}} = k_1\\frac{d[A]}{dt}|_{t^{\\ast}} = k_1(-k_1 [A](t^{\\ast})) = -k_1^2 [A](t^{\\ast})$.\nSince $k_1 > 0$ and $[A](t^{\\ast}) = A_0 \\exp(-k_1 t^{\\ast}) > 0$, the second derivative is negative. Thus, $t^{\\ast}$ corresponds to a local maximum. Given that $[B](0)=0$ and $[B](t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, this single extremum is the global maximum for $t>0$. The condition $k_2 > k_1 > 0$ ensures both the numerator and denominator are positive, so $t^{\\ast} > 0$.
