We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the System of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nThe system involves two species, a monomer $A$ and a dimer $D$, with concentrations denoted by $a(t)$ and $d(t)$, respectively. The dynamics are governed by three reactions. We apply the law of mass action to derive the rate of change for each concentration. The principle of mass action states that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient.\n\n1.  **Autocatalysis: $A \\xrightarrow{k_b} 2A$**\n    This reaction consumes one molecule of $A$ and produces two, resulting in a net production of one molecule of $A$. Assuming it is a first-order process with respect to $A$, its rate is $R_1 = k_b a(t)$. The contribution to the rate of change of $a(t)$ is $(2-1) \\times R_1 = +k_b a(t)$.\n\n2.  **Degradation: $A \\xrightarrow{k_d} \\emptyset$**\n    This reaction consumes one molecule of $A$. It is a first-order degradation process with rate $R_2 = k_d a(t)$. The contribution to the rate of change of $a(t)$ is $-1 \\times R_2 = -k_d a(t)$.\n\n3.  **Dimerization: $2A \\xrightarrow{k_c} D$**\n    This reaction consumes two molecules of $A$ to produce one molecule of $D$. It is a second-order process with respect to $A$. The rate of reaction events is $R_3 = k_c a(t)^2$. For each reaction event, two molecules of $A$ are consumed, so the contribution to the rate of change of $a(t)$ is $-2 \\times R_3 = -2k_c a(t)^2$. Concurrently, one molecule of $D$ is produced, contributing $+1 \\times R_3 = +k_c a(t)^2$ to the rate of change of $d(t)$.\n\nSumming the contributions for each species, we obtain the system of ODEs:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = k_b a(t) - k_d a(t) - 2k_c a(t)^2 = (k_b - k_d)a(t) - 2k_c a(t)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dd}{dt} = k_c a(t)^2\n$$\nThe system is subject to the initial conditions $a(0) = a_0  0$ and $d(0) = d_0 \\ge 0$. The equation for $a(t)$ is decoupled from $d(t)$ and can be analyzed independently.\n\n**Task 2: Analysis of Finite-Time Blow-up and Long-Time Behavior**\n\nThe dynamics of the monomer concentration $a(t)$ are described by the autonomous first-order ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = f(a) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad f(a) = (k_b - k_d)a - 2k_c a^2\n$$\nThe right-hand side $f(a)$ is a polynomial in $a$, which is continuously differentiable and thus locally Lipschitz on $\\mathbb{R}$. By the Picard-Lindelöf theorem, a unique solution exists for the initial value problem on a maximal time interval $[0, T_{max})$. Finite-time blow-up corresponds to the case where $T_{max}  \\infty$ and $\\lim_{t \\to T_{max}^-} a(t) = \\infty$.\n\nTo investigate this possibility, we analyze the behavior of $f(a)$ for large $a$. The dominant term in $f(a)$ for large $a$ is the quadratic term, $-2k_c a^2$. Since $k_c$ is a positive rate constant ($k_c  0$), this term is negative. This implies that for sufficiently large values of $a$, the derivative $\\frac{da}{dt}$ becomes negative, which drives the concentration $a(t)$ back towards smaller values. This heuristic suggests that blow-up is impossible.\n\nFor a rigorous argument, we show that the solution is bounded for all time. Let $a_00$ be the initial concentration. Since $f(0)=0$, the line $a=0$ is an invariant set. By uniqueness of solutions, a trajectory starting at $a_0  0$ cannot cross $a=0$, thus $a(t)  0$ for all $t \\in [0, T_{max})$.\nLet's find a value $M$ that serves as an upper bound. Consider the value $a_{peak}$ where $f(a)$ is maximum: $f'(a) = k_b - k_d - 4k_c a = 0 \\implies a_{peak} = \\frac{k_b-k_d}{4k_c}$. If $k_b \\le k_d$, $a_{peak} \\le 0$, and $f(a)  0$ for all $a  0$. In this scenario, $\\frac{da}{dt}  0$, so $a(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function bounded by $a_0$.\nIf $k_b  k_d$, then $a_{peak}  0$. For any concentration $a  \\frac{k_b-k_d}{2k_c}$, the term $(k_b-k_d) - 2k_c a$ is negative, making $f(a)  0$.\nLet $M = \\max\\left(a_0, \\frac{k_b-k_d}{2k_c} + \\epsilon\\right)$ for any $\\epsilon  0$. If the solution $a(t)$ were to reach $M$, its derivative $\\frac{da}{dt}|_{a=M} = f(M)$ would be negative. This means the solution cannot cross the level $M$ from below. Therefore, the trajectory is confined to the compact interval $[0, M]$.\nBy the extension theorem for ODEs, a solution that remains within a compact set must exist for all time. Thus, $T_{max} = \\infty$, and finite-time blow-up is impossible for any choice of positive parameters and initial data.\n\nThe long-time behavior depends on the sign of $k_b-k_d$.\nCase 1: $k_b \\le k_d$. In this case, $k_b-k_d \\le 0$. For any $a  0$, $\\frac{da}{dt} = (k_b-k_d)a - 2k_c a^2  0$. The concentration $a(t)$ monotonically decreases. The only non-negative equilibrium is $a=0$. Thus, for any $a_0  0$, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} a(t) = 0$.\nCase 2: $k_b  k_d$. The ODE is a logistic equation. The non-negative equilibria are $a=0$ and $a^* = \\frac{k_b-k_d}{2k_c}  0$. As established by the boundedness argument, any solution starting at $a_0  0$ approaches one of these equilibria. For $a \\in (0, a^*)$, $\\frac{da}{dt}  0$, and for $a  a^*$, $\\frac{da}{dt}  0$. This implies that the equilibrium $a=0$ is unstable (a repellor for $a0$) and the equilibrium $a^*$ is stable and attracts all solutions with $a_0  0$. Thus, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} a(t) = a^*$.\n\n**Task 3: Globally Attracting Equilibrium Concentration**\n\nWe are given the assumptions $k_b  k_d$ and $k_c  0$. The concentration of $A$ is governed by $\\frac{da}{dt} = (k_b-k_d)a - 2k_c a^2$.\nThe equilibrium concentrations are the non-negative steady-state solutions, found by setting $\\frac{da}{dt}=0$:\n$$\na((k_b-k_d) - 2k_c a) = 0\n$$\nThis gives two equilibria: $a_{eq,1} = 0$ and $a_{eq,2} = \\frac{k_b-k_d}{2k_c}$. Given the assumptions, $a_{eq,2}$ is a positive, physically meaningful equilibrium, which we denote as $a^*$.\n\nTo justify that $a^*$ is globally attracting for $a0$, we use a qualitative analysis of the ODE, which relies solely on the structure of the mass-action law's resulting polynomial. Let $f(a) = (k_b-k_d)a - 2k_c a^2 = 2k_c a\\left(\\frac{k_b-k_d}{2k_c} - a\\right) = 2k_c a(a^* - a)$.\nThe sign of $f(a)$ dictates the direction of change of $a(t)$.\n-   For $0  a  a^*$: Both $a$ and $(a^*-a)$ are positive. Since $k_c0$, we have $f(a)  0$, which implies $\\frac{da}{dt}  0$. Thus, any concentration starting in this interval will increase over time. This shows solutions move away from the $a=0$ equilibrium, establishing it as unstable.\n-   For $a  a^*$: The term $(a^*-a)$ is negative. We have $f(a)  0$, which implies $\\frac{da}{dt}  0$. Thus, any concentration starting above $a^*$ will decrease over time.\n\nThis phase-line analysis demonstrates that for any initial condition $a(0) = a_0  0$, the solution $a(t)$ will monotonically converge to $a^*$. If $0  a_0  a^*$, $a(t)$ increases towards $a^*$. If $a_0  a^*$, $a(t)$ decreases towards $a^*$. If $a_0=a^*$, $a(t)$ remains constant. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration $a^* = \\frac{k_b-k_d}{2k_c}$ is globally attracting for the domain of positive concentrations, $a \\in (0, \\infty)$.\nThe stability is confirmed by linear stability analysis: $f'(a) = k_b-k_d - 4k_c a$. At the equilibrium $a^*$, we have $f'(a^*) = (k_b-k_d) - 4k_c\\left(\\frac{k_b-k_d}{2k_c}\\right) = (k_b-k_d) - 2(k_b-k_d) = -(k_b-k_d)  0$, which confirms local asymptotic stability. The qualitative analysis above extends this to global attraction for $a_0  0$.\nThe globally attracting equilibrium concentration of $A$ is therefore given by the expression for $a^*$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_b - k_d}{2k_c}}\n$$", "id": "4370851"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems constantly process signals, but their full non-linear behavior can be complex.

Therefore, we have the elegant relationship:\n$$\nk_{\\max} g_{1}g_{2} = (a+b)(b+c)(c+a)\n$$\nSince $g_{1}  0$ and $g_{2}  0$, we can divide by their product to isolate $k_{\\max}$:\n$$\nk_{\\max} = \\frac{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}{g_{1}g_{2}}\n$$\nFor any value of the feedback gain $k$ such that $0 \\le k  k_{\\max}$, the Routh-Hurwitz inequality $(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)  abc + k g_{1}g_{2}$ is satisfied, and the system is locally asymptotically stable. At $k=k_{\\max}$, the system is on the verge of instability, typically leading to a Hopf bifurcation where oscillations can emerge.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}{g_{1}g_{2}}}\n$$", "id": "4370865"}]}
