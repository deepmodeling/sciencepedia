Under the asynchronous update scheme, at each discrete time step exactly one node that is not at its prescribed update value is selected and updated to that value, while the other nodes remain unchanged.

It is a standard exercise in the analysis of Boolean networks, a valid topic in systems biomedicine. All necessary definitions, functions, and constraints are provided. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe Boolean network consists of three nodes, $A$, $B$, and $C$, whose states belong to the set $\\{0,1\\}$. The total number of states in the system is $2^3=8$. The state of the network is given by the vector $(A,B,C)$. The update functions are provided as $f_A(A,B,C) = \\neg B$, $f_B(A,B,C) = C$, and $f_C(A,B,C) = A$. We can represent the target update vector for any state $(A,B,C)$ as $F = (f_A, f_B, f_C) = (\\neg B, C, A)$.\n\nUnder the asynchronous update scheme, a transition is possible from a state $S$ to a new state $S'$ if $S'$ is obtained by updating the value of exactly one node $X \\in \\{A,B,C\\}$ for which the current value $X$ is not equal to its target value $f_X$.\n\nWe will systematically enumerate all $8$ states, calculate their corresponding update vectors, and determine all possible successor states.\n\n1.  State $S_0 = (0,0,0)$:\n    The update vector is $F_0 = (\\neg 0, 0, 0) = (1,0,0)$.\n    Comparing $S_0$ and $F_0$, only node $A$ is unstable ($A=0$, $f_A=1$).\n    The only possible successor is by updating $A$: $(1,0,0)$.\n\n2.  State $S_1 = (0,0,1)$:\n    The update vector is $F_1 = (\\neg 0, 1, 0) = (1,1,0)$.\n    All three nodes are unstable ($A=0 \\neq f_A=1$, $B=0 \\neq f_B=1$, $C=1 \\neq f_C=0$).\n    There are three possible successors:\n    - Updating $A$: $(1,0,1)$\n    - Updating $B$: $(0,1,1)$\n    - Updating $C$: $(0,0,0)$\n\n3.  State $S_2 = (0,1,0)$:\n    The update vector is $F_2 = (\\neg 1, 0, 0) = (0,0,0)$.\n    Only node $B$ is unstable ($B=1$, $f_B=0$).\n    The only possible successor is by updating $B$: $(0,0,0)$.\n\n4.

State $S_5 = (1,0,1)$:\n    The update vector is $F_5 = (\\neg 0, 1, 1) = (1,1,1)$.\n    Only node $B$ is unstable ($B=0$, $f_B=1$).\n    The only possible successor is by updating $B$: $(1,1,1)$.\n\n7.  State $S_6 = (1,1,0)$:\n    The update vector is $F_6 = (\\neg 1, 0, 1) = (0,0,1)$.\n    All three nodes are unstable ($A=1 \\neq f_A=0$, $B=1 \\neq f_B=0$, $C=0 \\neq f_C=1$).\n    There are three possible successors:\n    - Updating $A$: $(0,1,0)$\n    - Updating $B$: $(1,0,0)$\n    - Updating $C$: $(1,1,1)$\n\n8.  State $S_7 = (1,1,1)$:\n    The update vector is $F_7 = (\\neg 1, 1, 1) = (0,1,1)$.\n    Only node $A$ is unstable ($A=1$, $f_A=0$).\n    The only possible successor is by updating $A$: $(0,1,1)$.\n\nA fixed point (or steady state) is a state $S$ such that $S=F$. This would require $(A,B,C) = (\\neg B, C, A)$, which implies $A = \\neg B$, $B=C$, and $C=A$. From the last two, $A=B=C$. But $A=\\neg B$ implies $A \\neq B$. This is a contradiction, so no fixed points exist. The attractors must be cyclic.\n\nNow we construct the state-transition graph. Let's trace a path starting from state $(0,0,0)$:\n$(0,0,0) \\to (1,0,0) \\to (1,0,1) \\to (1,1,1) \\to (0,1,1) \\to (0,1,0) \\to (0,0,0)$.\nThis sequence forms a cycle of length $6$. This set of $6$ states, let us call it $\\mathcal{A}$, is strongly connected. To be an attractor (a terminal SCC), no state in $\\mathcal{A}$ can have a transition to a state outside of $\\mathcal{A}$. We have already determined all successors for each state. A review of the transitions for the states in the cycle shows this is true:\n- $(0,0,0)$ transitions to $(1,0,0) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(1,0,0)$ transitions to $(1,0,1) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(1,0,1)$ transitions to $(1,1,1) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(1,1,1)$ transitions to $(0,1,1) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(0,1,1)$ transitions to $(0,1,0) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(0,1,0)$ transitions to $(0,0,0) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\nThus, the set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,1), (0,1,1), (0,1,0)\\}$ is a terminal SCC and therefore an attractor.\n\nThe two states not in this cycle are $(0,0,1)$ and $(1,1,0)$. Let's examine their transitions:\n- From $(0,0,1)$, transitions lead to $(1,0,1)$, $(0,1,1)$, and $(0,0,0)$. All three successor states are in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n- From $(1,1,0)$, transitions lead to $(0,1,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, and $(1,1,1)$. All three successor states are in $\\mathcalA$.\nSo, any state not in the attractor will eventually transition into it. This confirms that $\\mathcal{A}$ is the only attractor in the network.\n\nThe final step is to encode the states in $\\mathcal{A}$ as integers and list them in the order of the cycle starting from $(0,0,0)$. The encoding is given by the integer $I = 4A + 2B + C$.\nThe ordered states in the cycle are:\n1.  $(0,0,0) \\implies I = 4(0) + 2(0) + 0 = 0$\n2.  $(1,0,0) \\implies I = 4(1) + 2(0) + 0 = 4$\n3.  $(1,0,1) \\implies I = 4(1) + 2(0) + 1 = 5$\n4.  $(1,1,1) \\implies I = 4(1) + 2(1) + 1 = 7$\n5.  $(0,1,1) \\implies I = 4(0) + 2(1) + 1 = 3$\n6.  $(0,1,0) \\implies I = 4(0) + 2(1) + 0 = 2$\n\nThe ordered sequence of integers representing the attractor states is $(0, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  4  5  7  3  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4358401"}, {"introduction": "While discrete Boolean models are excellent for capturing switch-like behaviors, many biological signals are graded and operate on a continuous spectrum.

Therefore, both $I=0$ and $I=1$ are consistent fixed-point assignments.\nThus, there are two fixed points in this case:\n$$\n(T_A,T_B,G,I) = (1,1,1,0)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(1,1,1,1).\n$$\n\nCase 2: The transcription factor motif $\\{T_A=0,\\,T_B=0\\}$.\n- For $G$: With $T_A=0$ and $T_B=0$, $G^{t+1} = 0 \\lor G^{t} = G^{t}$. Therefore, both $G=0$ and $G=1$ are consistent fixed-point assignments.\n- For $I$: Consider subcases.\n  - Subcase 2a: $G=0$. Then $I^{t+1} = 1 \\lor I^{t} = 1$, forcing $I=1$ in any fixed point. This yields one fixed point:\n  $$\n  (T_A,T_B,G,I) = (0,0,0,1).\n  $$\n  - Subcase 2b: $G=1$. Then $I^{t+1} = 0 \\lor I^{t} = I^{t}$, so both $I=0$ and $I=1$ are consistent fixed-point assignments. This yields two fixed points:\n  $$\n  (T_A,T_B,G,I) = (0,0,1,0)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(0,0,1,1).\n  $$\n\nCollecting all fixed-point attractors, we have the following distinct long-term states:\n$$\n(1,1,1,0),\\quad(1,1,1,1),\\quad(0,0,0,1),\\quad(0,0,1,0),\\quad(0,0,1,1).\n$$\nThere are no oscillatory attractors under these rules, because all feedback cycles are either positive and admit fixed assignments (the $T_A$–$T_B$ loop), or include positive self-loops that stabilize specific values ($G$ and $I$), and there is no negative feedback loop that would force alternation. In asynchronous Boolean networks with this structure, the identified fixed points exhaust the admissible long-term states.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of admissible long-term states (fixed-point attractors) is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "4358399"}]}
