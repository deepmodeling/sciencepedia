In one dimension, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = R(P)\n$$\nwhere $J(x,t)$ is the flux of the protein and $R(P)$ is the net rate of its production per unit volume.\n\nThe problem states that transport is governed by Fickian diffusion.
