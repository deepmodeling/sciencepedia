This is a $6 \\times 6$ matrix representing the entire multiplex network. For a two-layer network with identity coupling, the supra-adjacency matrix is a block matrix of the form:\n$$\nA^{\\mathrm{supra}} = \\begin{pmatrix} A^{(1)}  \\omega I \\\\ \\omega I  A^{(2)} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ are the $3 \\times 3$ intralayer adjacency matrices, $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix, and $\\omega$ is the interlayer coupling weight. The blocks are arranged according to the specified node-layer ordering $(G_{1},1),(G_{2},1),(G_{3},1),(G_{1},2),(G_{2},2),(G_{3},2)$.\n\nGiven $\\omega = 0.4$, the interlayer coupling block is:\n$$\n\\omega I = 0.4 \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.4  0  0 \\\\ 0  0.4  0 \\\\ 0  0  0.4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the given matrices $A^{(1)}$, $A^{(2)}$, and $\\omega I$ into the block structure, we get:\n$$\nA^{\\mathrm{supra}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0  0.4  0  0 \\\\\n1  0  1  0  0.4  0 \\\\\n0  1  0  0  0  0.4 \\\\\n0.4  0  0  0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0.4  0  0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0.4  1  1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the total weighted degree of the node-layer pair $(G_{2},1)$, denoted as $k^{\\mathrm{supra}}_{(G_{2},1)}$. According to the specified ordering, this corresponds to the second row of $A^{\\mathrm{supra}}$. The degree is the sum of all elements in this row.\nThe second row of $A^{\\mathrm{supra}}$ is $(1, 0, 1, 0, 0.4, 0)$.\n$$\nk^{\\mathrm{supra}}_{(G_{2},1)} = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0.4 + 0 = 2.4\n$$\nThis degree consists of the intralayer degree of $G_2$ in layer $1$ (which is $1+1=2$) and the interlayer coupling to its counterpart $(G_2,2)$ (which is $\\omega = 0.4$).\n\nNow, we construct the aggregated adjacency matrix, $A^{\\mathrm{agg}}$, by summing the intralayer adjacency matrices.\n$$\nA^{\\mathrm{agg}} = A^{(1)} + A^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0\\\\ 1  0  1\\\\ 0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1\\\\ 0  0  1\\\\ 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1\\\\ 1  0  2\\\\ 1  2  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the weighted degree of node $G_{2}$ in the aggregated network, $k^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{G_{2}}$. This is the sum of the elements in the second row of $A^{\\mathrm{agg}}$.\nThe second row of $A^{\\mathrm{agg}}$ is $(1, 0, 2)$.\n$$\nk^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{G_{2}} = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3\n$$\nThis aggregated degree is the sum of the intralayer degrees of $G_2$ across all layers. The degree of $G_2$ in layer $1$ is $2$, and in layer $2$ it is $1$, so $k^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{G_{2}} = 2+1=3$.\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta$.\n$$\n\\Delta = k^{\\mathrm{supra}}_{(G_{2},1)} - k^{\\mathrm{agg}}_{G_{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$\n\\Delta = 2.4 - 3 = -0.6\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.6}$$", "id": "4364025"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond local structure to global pathways, this practice explores how to find the most efficient path in a multiplex system where different layers offer different costs and switching between them incurs its own penalty.

Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is to find the shortest path from node $R$ to node $T$ in a two-layer multiplex network. This can be conceptualized as finding the shortest path in an expanded graph containing $6$ nodes: $\\{R^{\\mathcal{P}}, K^{\\mathcal{P}}, T^{\\mathcal{P}}, R^{\\mathcal{G}}, K^{\\mathcal{G}}, T^{\\mathcal{G}}\\}$. The 'source' is the set $\\{R^{\\mathcal{P}}, R^{\\mathcal{G}}\\}$ and the 'target' is the set $\\{T^{\\mathcal{P}}, T^{\\mathcal{G}}\\}$.\n\nA path from $R$ to $T$ must pass through $K$, as no direct $R\\text{--}T$ edges are specified. We must consider all possible valid paths and their costs. A path can either remain within a single layer or switch between layers.\n\nLet us analyze the costs of the primary path categories:\n\n1.  **Path entirely in Layer $\\mathcal{P}$:** The path is $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{P}}$.\n    The cost, $C_{\\mathcal{P}}$, is the sum of the weights of the intralayer edges:\n    $$C_{\\mathcal{P}} = w(R^{\\mathcal{P}}, K^{\\mathcal{P}}) + w(K^{\\mathcal{P}}, T^{\\mathcal{P}}) = 1 + 9 = 10$$\n\n2.  **Path entirely in Layer $\\mathcal{G}$:** The path is $R^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$.\n    The cost, $C_{\\mathcal{G}}$, is the sum of the weights of the intralayer edges:\n    $$C_{\\mathcal{G}} = w(R^{\\mathcal{G}}, K^{\\mathcal{G}}) + w(K^{\\mathcal{G}}, T^{\\mathcal{G}}) = 3 + 4 = 7$$\n\n3.  **Paths that switch layers:** A layer switch can occur at any node ($R$, $K$, or $T$). A switch introduces a cost of $\\gamma$.\n    - A switch at the start node $R$ (e.g., $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow R^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$) or the end node $T$ (e.g., $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$) is suboptimal. For example, the cost of switching at $R$ and then traversing layer $\\mathcal{G}$ is $\\gamma + C_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\gamma + 7$. Since $\\gamma  0$, this is strictly greater than $C_{\\mathcal{G}} = 7$. A similar argument holds for switching at $T$.\n    - Paths with more than one switch are also suboptimal. For instance, $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{P}}$ incurs two switching costs ($2\\gamma$), making it more expensive than a single-switch path.\n    - The most efficient switching paths are those that switch exactly once at the intermediate node, $K$. There are two such possibilities:\n\n    a.  **Switch from $\\mathcal{P}$ to $\\mathcal{G}$ at $K$:** The path is $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$.\n        The cost, $C_{\\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathcal{G}}$, is the sum of weights of the first segment in $\\mathcal{P}$, the interlayer jump at $K$, and the second segment in $\\mathcal{G}$:\n        $$C_{\\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathcal{G}} = w(R^{\\mathcal{P}}, K^{\\mathcal{P}}) + \\gamma + w(K^{\\mathcal{G}}, T^{\\mathcal{G}}) = 1 + \\gamma + 4 = 5 + \\gamma$$\n\n    b.  **Switch from $\\mathcal{G}$ to $\\mathcal{P}$ at $K$:** The path is $R^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{P}}$.\n        The cost, $C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}}$, is calculated similarly:\n        $$C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}} = w(R^{\\mathcal{G}}, K^{\\mathcal{G}}) + \\gamma + w(K^{\\mathcal{P}}, T^{\\mathcal{P}}) = 3 + \\gamma + 9 = 12 + \\gamma$$\n\nThe effective shortest-path cost, $C_{min}(\\gamma)$, is the minimum of the costs of all viable paths:\n$$C_{min}(\\gamma) = \\min(C_{\\mathcal{P}}, C_{\\mathcal{G}}, C_{\\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathcal{G}}, C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}})$$\n$$C_{min}(\\gamma) = \\min(10, 7, 5 + \\gamma, 12 + \\gamma)$$\n\nSince $\\gamma  0$, we know that $12 + \\gamma  12$, so $C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}} = 12 + \\gamma$ is always greater than $C_{\\mathcal{P}}=10$ and $C_{\\mathcal{G}}=7$. Thus, this path is never optimal. The expression simplifies to:\n$$C_{min}(\\gamma) = \\min(10, 7, 5 + \\gamma) = \\min(7, 5 + \\gamma)$$\n\nThis equation provides the shortest-path cost as a function of $\\gamma$:\n- If $5 + \\gamma  7$, the shortest path is the switching path $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$ with cost $5 + \\gamma$. This occurs when $\\gamma  2$.\n- If $5 + \\gamma  7$, the shortest path is the single-layer path $R^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$ with cost $7$. This occurs when $\\gamma  2$.\n- If $5 + \\gamma = 7$, both paths are equally optimal. This occurs when $\\gamma = 2$.\n\nThe critical value $\\gamma^{\\star}$ is the value of $\\gamma$ at which the optimal path strategy changes. This transition occurs when the cost of the best single-layer path equals the cost of the best switching path.\n\nThe best single-layer path cost is $\\min(C_{\\mathcal{P}}, C_{\\mathcal{G}}) = \\min(10, 7) = 7$.\nThe best switching path cost is $\\min(C_{\\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathcal{G}}, C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}}) = \\min(5 + \\gamma, 12 + \\gamma) = 5+\\gamma$.\n\nSetting these two costs equal to find the critical point $\\gamma^{\\star}$:\n$$7 = 5 + \\gamma^{\\star}$$\n$$\\gamma^{\\star} = 7 - 5 = 2$$\n\nFor $0  \\gamma  2$, the optimal path switches layers because $5+\\gamma  7$.\nFor $\\gamma  2$, the optimal path remains within layer $\\mathcal{G}$ because $7  5+\\gamma$.\nAt $\\gamma = \\gamma^{\\star} = 2$, the two path types have the same cost, and the behavior of the optimal path changes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4363971"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise incorporates the crucial dimension of time, a defining feature of most biological processes.

The latency is defined as the difference between the earliest possible arrival time at the target and the start time. This is equivalent to a shortest path problem on a time-aware, layer-aware graph, where the path \"length\" is the arrival time. We can solve this by systematically exploring all possible paths from the source to the target and computing their respective arrival times, or by employing a Dijkstra-like algorithm on the state space defined by (node, time, last layer).\n\nThe state of a signal can be described by its current location (node), the time of arrival at that node, and the layer of the contact that was traversed to reach it. The last piece of information is necessary to correctly apply the inter-layer switching penalty $s$. Let $T(u, \\mathcal{L}_{\\ell})$ be the earliest arrival time at node $u$ via a contact on layer $\\mathcal{L}_{\\ell}$. The initial condition is at node $N_{0}$ at time $t_{0} = 2$.

This is achieved via the path $N_{0} \\to N_{4} \\to N_{5}$.\n\nThe minimum latency is the difference between the earliest arrival time and the start time:\nMinimum Latency = $12 - t_{0} = 12 - 2 = 10$ minutes.\n\nThe secondary task is to compute the static shortest path length and comment. The layer-aggregated directed graph contains an edge $(u,v)$ if a contact from $u$ to $v$ exists on any layer at any time. The contacts include $(N_{0}, N_{1}), (N_{0}, N_{2}), (N_{0}, N_{4}),$ and $(N_{0}, N_{5})$. Since there is a direct edge $(N_{0}, N_{5})$, the shortest path in terms of number of hops (edges) is $1$. The minimum-latency path, $N_{0} \\to N_{4} \\to N_{5}$, has a hop length of $2$. The static shortest path ($1$ hop) corresponds to a latency of $108 - 2 = 106$ minutes, whereas the temporally optimal path ($2$ hops) has a much smaller latency of $10$ minutes. This highlights a fundamental distinction in network analysis: the topologically shortest path in a static graph aggregation can be highly suboptimal when temporal dynamics and traversal costs are considered. The temporal constraints (activation times) and multiplex costs (layer switching) are critical factors that determine the true optimal path in a dynamic system.\n\nThe question requires reporting only the minimum latency.\nThe minimum latency is $10$ minutes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "4363966"}]}
