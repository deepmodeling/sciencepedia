The model presented is the canonical representation of a symmetric genetic toggle switch, a fundamental motif in systems and synthetic biology. The task is to find the critical parameter value for the onset of bistability using standard methods of dynamical systems analysis. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are described by the coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^{n}}-x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^{n}}-y\n$$\nFixed points, or steady states, $(x^*, y^*)$ of the system are solutions to the algebraic equations where the time derivatives are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \\implies x^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(y^*)^{n}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\implies y^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(x^*)^{n}}\n$$\nThese two equations define the $x$-nullcline and $y$-nullcline, respectively. The problem concerns the stability of the symmetric fixed point. Due to the symmetry of the equations, if a fixed point $(x^*, y^*)$ exists, then $(y^*, x^*)$ is also a fixed point. A symmetric fixed point is one where $x^* = y^*$. Let us denote this symmetric state as $x_s = x^* = y^*$. Substituting $y^*=x^*$ into either nullcline equation gives:\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x_s^n} \\implies \\alpha = x_s(1+x_s^n)\n$$\nThis equation relates the concentration $x_s$ at the symmetric fixed point to the parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nTo determine the stability of this fixed point, we perform linear stability analysis. We compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system, evaluated at the fixed point $(x_s, x_s)$. The vector field is given by $F(x,y) = (f(x,y), g(x,y))$, where $f(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^n} - x$ and $g(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^n} - y$. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -\\frac{\\alpha n y^{n-1}}{(1+y^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha n x^{n-1}}{(1+x^n)^2}  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEvaluating the Jacobian at the symmetric fixed point $(x_s, x_s)$:\n$$\nJ(x_s, x_s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -\\frac{\\alpha n x_s^{n-1}}{(1+x_s^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha n x_s^{n-1}}{(1+x_s^n)^2}  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe can simplify the off-diagonal elements by substituting the expression for $\\alpha$ from the fixed point condition: $\\alpha = x_s(1+x_s^n)$.\n$$\n-\\frac{\\alpha n x_s^{n-1}}{(1+x_s^n)^2} = -\\frac{x_s(1+x_s^n) n x_s^{n-1}}{(1+x_s^n)^2} = -\\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n}\n$$\nLet this term be denoted by $C = -\\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n}$. The Jacobian at the symmetric fixed point is:\n$$\nJ_s = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  C \\\\ C  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of this matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(J_s - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1-\\lambda  C \\\\ C  -1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-1-\\lambda)^2 - C^2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives $(1+\\lambda)^2 = C^2$, which leads to $1+\\lambda = \\pm C$. The two eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -1 + C = -1 - \\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = -1 - C = -1 - \\left(-\\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n}\\right) = -1 + \\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n}\n$$\nFor the fixed point to be stable, both eigenvalues must have negative real parts.\nSince $n \\ge 1$ and $x_s  0$, the term $\\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n}$ is always positive. Therefore, $\\lambda_1 = -1 - (\\text{positive term})$ is always negative.\nThe stability of the symmetric fixed point is thus determined entirely by the sign of $\\lambda_2$. The fixed point is stable if $\\lambda_2  0$ and unstable if $\\lambda_2  0$.\n\nThe emergence of bistability corresponds to the point where the symmetric fixed point loses its stability. In this symmetric system, this occurs via a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, where the stable symmetric fixed point becomes unstable and gives rise to a pair of new, stable asymmetric fixed points. This bifurcation happens precisely when the governing eigenvalue passes through zero. The critical condition is therefore $\\lambda_2 = 0$.\n$$\n-1 + \\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n} = 1\n$$\n$$\nn x_s^n = 1+x_s^n\n$$\n$$\n(n-1)x_s^n = 1\n$$\nThis equation can only be satisfied if $n-1  0$, i.e., $n1$. For the non-cooperative case $n=1$, the equation becomes $0=1$, which is impossible. Indeed, for $n=1$, $\\lambda_2 = -1 + \\frac{x_s}{1+x_s} = \\frac{-1-x_s+x_s}{1+x_s} = -\\frac{1}{1+x_s}  0$, so the system is always monostable.

Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe VAR(1) model is specified as $x_t = A x_{t-1} + e_t$. For an impulse experiment with $x_{-1} = (0, 0)^{\\top}$, $e_0 = (1, 0)^{\\top}$, and $e_t = (0, 0)^{\\top}$ for $t \\geq 1$, the state of the system evolves as follows:\n$x_0 = A x_{-1} + e_0 = A(0,0)^{\\top} + (1,0)^{\\top} = (1,0)^{\\top}$.\nFor $t \\geq 1$, the dynamics are governed by the homogeneous equation $x_t = A x_{t-1}$.

In this framework, $h(k)$ is simply the matrix $A^k$, since $x_k = A^k e_0$. The vector $x_k$ represents the response at horizon $k$ to the impulse vector $e_0$.

The means are $E[X_2] = 0$ and $E[X_1] = 0$, matching the target.\n\nWe calculate the components of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma_B$:\nThe variance of $X_2$ is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(X_2) = E[X_2^2] - (E[X_2])^2 = E[\\varepsilon_2'^2] - 0^2 = \\sigma_2'^2 $$\nThe variance of $X_1$ is, using the independence of $X_2=\\varepsilon_2'$ and $\\varepsilon_1'$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(X_1) = E[(b' X_2 + \\varepsilon_1')^2] = E[b'^2 X_2^2 + 2b' X_2 \\varepsilon_1' + \\varepsilon_1'^2] $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(X_1) = b'^2 E[X_2^2] + 2b' E[X_2]E[\\varepsilon_1'] + E[\\varepsilon_1'^2] = b'^2 \\sigma_2'^2 + \\sigma_1'^2 $$\nThe covariance of $X_1$ and $X_2$ is:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = E[X_1 X_2] - E[X_1]E[X_2] = E[(b' X_2 + \\varepsilon_1') X_2] - 0 = E[b' X_2^2 + \\varepsilon_1' X_2] $$\n$$ \\text{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = b' E[X_2^2] + E[\\varepsilon_1']E[X_2] = b' \\sigma_2'^2 + 0 = b' \\sigma_2'^2 $$\nThe covariance matrix for Topology B is:\n$$ \\Sigma_B = \\begin{pmatrix} b'^2 \\sigma_2'^2 + \\sigma_1'^2  b' \\sigma_2'^2 \\\\ b' \\sigma_2'^2  \\sigma_2'^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe equate $\\Sigma_B$ with $\\Sigma^*$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} b'^2 \\sigma_2'^2 + \\sigma_1'^2  b' \\sigma_2'^2 \\\\ b' \\sigma_2'^2  \\sigma_2'^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis yields another system of three equations:\n1. $\\sigma_2'^2 = 1$\n2. $b' \\sigma_2'^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n3. $b'^2 \\sigma_2'^2 + \\sigma_1'^2 = 1$\n\nFrom equation 1, we have $\\sigma_2'^2 = 1$.\nSubstituting this into equation 2, we get $b'(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $b' = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting these results into equation 3, we get $(\\frac{1}{2})^2 (1) + \\sigma_1'^2 = 1$, which is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\sigma_1'^2 = 1$.\nSolving for $\\sigma_1'^2$ gives $\\sigma_1'^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe parameter set for Topology B is $(b', \\sigma_2'^2, \\sigma_1'^2) = (\\frac{1}{2}, 1, \\frac{3}{4})$. This is also a valid parameterization.\n\n**Kullback-Leibler Divergence Calculation**\n\nWe have demonstrated that both Topology A and Topology B, with the derived parameters, produce the exact same steady-state distribution, which is $\\mathcal{N}\\!\\left( \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\Sigma^{\\ast} \\right)$. This situation is known as observational equivalence; the underlying causal structure cannot be distinguished from this observational data alone.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\!\\left(\\mathcal{N}\\!\\left( \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\Sigma^{\\ast} \\right) \\,\\Big\\|\\, \\mathcal{N}\\!\\left( \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\Sigma^{\\ast} \\right)\\right) $$\nLet $P$ and $Q$ be two probability distributions. The Kullback-Leibler divergence from $Q$ to $P$ is defined as:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P \\| Q) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\right) dx $$\nwhere $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are the probability density functions of $P$ and $Q$, respectively.\n\nIn this specific problem, the two distributions are identical. Let $P = Q = \\mathcal{N}\\!\\left( \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\Sigma^{\\ast} \\right)$. Then $p(x) = q(x)$ for all $x$ in the support of the distributions.\nTherefore, the ratio $\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = 1$ for all $x$.\nThe logarithm of this ratio is $\\ln(1) = 0$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P \\| P) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) \\cdot 0 \\ dx = 0 $$\nThis is a fundamental property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It is always zero when comparing a distribution to itself. The value of the $KL$ divergence is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "4384109"}]}
