This practice [@problem_id:4373863] provides a foundational exercise in calculating this score, a critical first step in converting raw genotypic data into an actionable phenotype classification.", "problem": "A pharmacogenomic assessment is performed in Systems Biomedicine to quantify cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolic capacity using the activity score system endorsed by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). In this model, the predicted enzyme-mediated metabolic capacity is approximated from gene dose and allele function under the following foundational assumptions and well-tested facts:\n\n- Gene dosage contributes proportionally to enzyme abundance under the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, so the contribution from a given allele is the product of its per-copy functional activity and its copy number.\n- The total predicted capacity is the sum of contributions from both haplotypes in a diplotype, which is modeled linearly as the activity score.\n- Widely used functional designations for CYP2D6 star alleles include nonfunctional alleles (per-copy activity $0$), normal function alleles (per-copy activity $1$), and increased copy number denoted by $xN$ on a haplotype, which multiplies the per-copy contribution by the integer $N$.\n- CPIC maps activity score to metabolizer phenotype categories by widely accepted thresholds: poor metabolizer if activity score $=0$, intermediate metabolizer if activity score $\\in [0.25,1]$, normal metabolizer if activity score $\\in [1.25,2.25]$, and ultrarapid metabolizer if activity score $>2.25$.\n\nA patient’s diplotype is reported as one haplotype carrying CYP2D6*4 and the other haplotype carrying CYP2D6*2x3.

The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness, as it is based on the established and widely used Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for CYP2D6 genotyping and phenotype prediction.\n\nThe fundamental principle for calculating the total activity score ($AS_{total}$) is the linear summation of the activity scores from the two haplotypes that constitute the patient's diplotype. Let the activity scores of the first and second haplotypes be $AS_{H1}$ and $AS_{H2}$, respectively. The model is expressed as:\n$$\nAS_{total} = AS_{H1} + AS_{H2}\n$$\nThe activity score for a single haplotype is defined as the product of the per-copy functional activity value of the allele present on that haplotype and the number of copies of that allele.\n\nThe patient's diplotype is given as CYP2D6*4 / CYP2D6*2x3. We will analyze each haplotype separately.\n\n**Haplotype 1: CYP2D6\\*4**\nThis haplotype contains the CYP2D6*4 allele.\n- The problem states that the CYP2D6*4 allele is a nonfunctional allele. Its per-copy activity value, which we shall denote as $a_1$, is therefore $0$.\n- The copy number for a standard allele without any specified multiplication is $1$. Let us denote this copy number as $c_1$. So, $c_1 = 1$.\n- The activity score for this haplotype is calculated as:\n$$\nAS_{H1} = a_1 \\times c_1 = 0 \\times 1 = 0\n$$\n\n**Haplotype 2: CYP2D6\\*2x3**\nThis haplotype is described by the notation CYP2D6*2x3.\n- The allele involved is CYP2D6*2. The problem specifies this is a normal function allele, meaning its per-copy activity value, $a_2$, is $1$.\n- The notation `x3` indicates a gene duplication event, resulting in three copies of the CYP2D6*2 allele on this single haplotype. Therefore, the copy number, $c_2$, is $3$.\n- The activity score for this haplotype is calculated as:\n$$\nAS_{H2} = a_2 \\times c_2 = 1 \\times 3 = 3\n$$\n\n**Total Activity Score**\nThe total activity score for the patient's diplotype is the sum of the scores from the two haplotypes:\n$$\nAS_{total} = AS_{H1} + AS_{H2} = 0 + 3 = 3\n$$\nThe calculated CYP2D6 activity score for this diplotype is $3$.\n\n**Phenotype Classification**\nTo complete the analysis as per the problem's context, this score is used to classify the patient's metabolizer phenotype based on the given CPIC thresholds:\n- Poor metabolizer: Activity Score $= 0$\n- Intermediate metabolizer: Activity Score $\\in [0.25, 1]$\n- Normal metabolizer: Activity Score $\\in [1.25, 2.25]$\n- Ultrarapid metabolizer: Activity Score $> 2.25$\n\nSince the calculated activity score is $3$, which satisfies the condition $3 > 2.25$, the patient is classified as an ultrarapid metabolizer.\n\nThe question asks for the numeric activity score only as the final answer.\nThe computed activity score is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "4373863"}, {"introduction": "Once an enzyme activity score is determined, the next step is to understand its quantitative impact on drug pharmacokinetics and adjust dosing accordingly.

The concepts of systemic clearance ($CL$), CYP-mediated metabolism, CPIC activity scores, and dose adjustments based on genotype are standard in clinical pharmacology and systems biomedicine. The assumptions provided (linear pharmacokinetics, additive clearance pathways, linear scaling of enzyme activity) are common and valid simplifications used in pharmacokinetic modeling to guide dosing. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The data are dimensionally consistent and plausible for a drug metabolized by CYP2D6. The problem is not trivial, as it requires the correct application of clearance concepts to a specific pharmacogenomic scenario. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to determine a dose adjustment for a patient with reduced CYP2D6 enzyme activity to match the steady-state drug concentration observed in a reference population of normal metabolizers.\n\nFor a drug administered chronically with linear pharmacokinetics, the average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$, is given by the ratio of the rate of drug administration, $R_0$, to the total systemic clearance, $CL_{tot}$.\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{R_0}{CL_{tot}}$$\nThe rate of administration, $R_0$, is defined as $\\frac{F \\times \\text{Dose}}{\\tau}$, where $F$ is the bioavailability, $\\text{Dose}$ is the administered dose, and $\\tau$ is the dosing interval.\n\nThe total clearance, $CL_{tot}$, is the sum of clearance from all parallel pathways. In this case, it is the sum of clearance mediated by CYP2D6, $CL_{CYP2D6}$, and clearance through other pathways, $CL_{other}$.\n$$CL_{tot} = CL_{CYP2D6} + CL_{other}$$\n\nFirst, we establish the baseline clearance values for the reference population of Normal Metabolizers (NM).\nThe total clearance for an NM is given as $CL_{tot, NM} = 10\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$.\nThe CYP2D6-mediated clearance in an NM is a fraction $f_{m,CYP2D6} = 0.70$ of the total clearance.\n$$CL_{CYP2D6, NM} = f_{m,CYP2D6} \\times CL_{tot, NM} = 0.70 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$$\nThe clearance by other pathways is the remaining fraction $f_{m,other} = 0.30$.\n$$CL_{other, NM} = f_{m,other} \\times CL_{tot, NM} = 0.30 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$$\nThese other pathways are stated to be unaffected by CYP2D6 genotype, so $CL_{other}$ is constant for all individuals. Thus, for any patient, $CL_{other} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total clearance for the patient, who has a reduced CYP2D6 activity score. Let's denote this patient as a Poor Metabolizer (PM) for this context. The CPIC activity score for the NM is $S_{NM} = 2.0$, and for the patient is $S_{PM} = 0.5$.\nThe problem states that CYP2D6-mediated clearance scales linearly with the CPIC activity score. The clearance for the patient, $CL_{CYP2D6, PM}$, can be calculated by scaling the reference clearance, $CL_{CYP2D6, NM}$, by the ratio of the activity scores.\n$$CL_{CYP2D6, PM} = CL_{CYP2D6, NM} \\times \\frac{S_{PM}}{S_{NM}}$$\n$$CL_{CYP2D6, PM} = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} \\times \\frac{0.5}{2.0} = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} \\times 0.25 = 1.75\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$$\nNow, we can compute the total clearance for the patient, $CL_{tot, PM}$.\n$$CL_{tot, PM} = CL_{CYP2D6, PM} + CL_{other} = 1.75\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} + 3.0\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 4.75\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$$\n\nThe therapeutic goal is to adjust the patient's dose, and thus their administration rate $R_{0, PM}$, to achieve the same steady-state concentration as a normal metabolizer receiving the standard dose (with administration rate $R_{0, NM}$).\n$$C_{ss,avg, PM} = C_{ss,avg, NM}$$\n$$\\frac{R_{0, PM}}{CL_{tot, PM}} = \\frac{R_{0, NM}}{CL_{tot, NM}}$$\nWe can solve for the required administration rate for the patient:\n$$R_{0, PM} = R_{0, NM} \\times \\frac{CL_{tot, PM}}{CL_{tot, NM}}$$\nSince the administration rate $R_0$ is directly proportional to the dose (assuming constant $F$ and $\\tau$), the ratio of doses is equal to the ratio of administration rates. Let $\\text{Dose}_{PM}$ be the adjusted dose for the patient and $\\text{Dose}_{NM}$ be the standard dose for the normal metabolizer.\n$$\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{PM}}{\\text{Dose}_{NM}} = \\frac{R_{0, PM}}{R_{0, NM}} = \\frac{CL_{tot, PM}}{CL_{tot, NM}}$$\nThis ratio is the required dose fraction.\n$$\\text{Dose fraction} = \\frac{4.75\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}}{10\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}} = 0.475$$\nThe problem requires this fraction to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Dose fraction} = 0.4750$$\nThis means the patient should receive a starting dose that is $47.50\\%$ of the standard dose.\n\nAs a verification step, we calculate the fold-change in concentration if the patient were given the standard dose without adjustment. In this scenario, $\\text{Dose}_{PM} = \\text{Dose}_{NM}$, which implies $R_{0, PM} = R_{0, NM}$. The ratio of the patient's steady-state concentration to the normal metabolizer's concentration would be:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,avg, PM}}{C_{ss,avg, NM}} = \\frac{R_{0, NM} / CL_{tot, PM}}{R_{0, NM} / CL_{tot, NM}} = \\frac{CL_{tot, NM}}{CL_{tot, PM}}$$\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}}{4.75\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}} \\approx 2.10526...$$\nThus, without a dose adjustment, the patient would experience an approximate $2.1$-fold increase in steady-state drug concentration compared to a normal metabolizer, confirming the necessity of the dose reduction.
