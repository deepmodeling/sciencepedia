First, we derive the general distribution of the $z$-statistics. Second, we apply this result to the specific case provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the $z$-statistic and its Distribution**\n\nWe begin by examining the single-SNP Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model for SNP $j$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\alpha_{j}\\mathbf{1} + \\beta_{j}\\mathbf{g}_{j} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{j}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the phenotype vector, $\\mathbf{g}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the genotype vector for SNP $j$, and $\\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones. The problem states that both the phenotype vector $\\mathbf{y}$ and each genotype vector $\\mathbf{g}_{j}$ are standardized to have a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{X}_{j} = [\\mathbf{1}, \\mathbf{g}_j]$ be the design matrix for this regression. The OLS estimators for $\\alpha_j$ and $\\beta_j$ are given by $\\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{\\alpha}_j \\\\ \\hat{\\beta}_j \\end{pmatrix} = (\\mathbf{X}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{j})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}$.\n\nDue to the standardization, the columns of $\\mathbf{X}_j$ are orthogonal. We have $\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{g}_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_{ij} = n \\bar{g}_{j} = 0$.\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{j}$ is therefore block-diagonal:\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{j} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{1} & \\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{g}_{j} \\\\ \\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{1} & \\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{g}_{j} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} n & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{g}_{j} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe condition that $\\mathbf{g}_{j}$ has variance $1$ means $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (g_{ij} - \\bar{g}_j)^2 = 1$. Since $\\bar{g}_j = 0$, this simplifies to $\\frac{1}{n}\\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{g}_{j} = 1$, which implies $\\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{g}_{j} = n$.\nSubstituting this, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{j} = \\begin{pmatrix} n & 0 \\\\ 0 & n \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\implies \\quad (\\mathbf{X}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{j})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{n} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{n} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe vector of OLS estimates is then:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{\\alpha}_j \\\\ \\hat{\\beta}_j \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{n} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{n} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{n}\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\frac{1}{n}\\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{y}$ is also standardized to have mean $0$, $\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y} = n\\bar{y} = 0$. Thus, the estimator for the intercept is $\\hat{\\alpha}_{j} = 0$. The estimator for the SNP effect size $\\beta_j$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{j} = \\frac{1}{n}\\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nThe sampling variance of $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ is given by $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{j}) = (\\sigma_{j}^{2}) [(\\mathbf{X}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{j})^{-1}]_{22}$, where $(\\sigma_{j}^{2})$ is the variance of the residuals $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{j}$. From the full model $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\theta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, the residual variance is $\\sigma^2$. So, we have $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{j}) = \\sigma^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$.\n\nThe $z$-statistic for SNP $j$ is the ratio of the estimated effect to its standard error, $z_j = \\hat{\\beta}_j / \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_j)$.\n$$\nz_{j} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{j}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2/n}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n}\\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{n}}\\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0: \\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\mathbf{0}$, the full model simplifies to $\\mathbf{y} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\sigma^{2}\\mathbf{I}_{n})$. The stated condition that the vector $\\mathbf{y}$ is standardized to have variance $1$ means that under $H_0$, the variance of any component $y_i$ is $1$. Since $\\mathrm{Var}(y_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_i) = \\sigma^2$, this implies $\\sigma^2 = 1$.\n\nWith $\\sigma^2=1$, the $z$-statistic becomes:\n$$\nz_{j} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\mathbf{g}_{j}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nWe can express the vector of $z$-statistics $\\mathbf{z} = (z_1, z_2, \\ldots, z_p)^{\\top}$ in matrix form.\n$$\n\\mathbf{z} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\mathbf{G}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nNow we find the joint distribution of $\\mathbf{z}$ under $H_0$. Under $H_0$, $\\mathbf{y} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}_{n})$, since $\\sigma^{2} = 1$.

Therefore, $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\mathbf{R}$.\n\nThe joint sampling distribution of the vector of $z$-statistics under the null hypothesis is a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector $\\mathbf{0}$ and covariance matrix $\\mathbf{R}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{R})\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Variance of the contrast $z_1 - z_2$**\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\mathrm{Var}(z_{1} - z_{2})$ for a locus with $p=2$ SNPs, where the LD matrix is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & r \\\\ r & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the result of Part 1, the covariance matrix of the vector $\\mathbf{z} = (z_1, z_2)^{\\top}$ is $\\mathbf{R}$.

The $1$:$1$ binding equilibrium is represented as:\n      $$P + A \\rightleftharpoons C$$\n    The dissociation constant, $K_d$, describes this equilibrium:\n      $$K_d = \\frac{[P]_{eq} [A]_{eq}}{[C]_{eq}}$$\n    where $[...]_{eq}$ denotes the concentration of each species at equilibrium. The total protein concentration, $[P]_{total}$, is the quantity of biological interest, and it is the sum of free protein and bound protein: $[P]_{total} = [P]_{eq} + [C]_{eq}$. The assay signal is given to be proportional to $[C]_{eq}$.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of the Spurious pQTL:**\n    - A coding SNV alters the amino acid sequence of the protein $P$. If this alteration occurs within the aptamer's binding epitope, it can change the strength of the non-covalent interactions between the protein and the aptamer.\n    - A change in interaction strength corresponds to a change in the Gibbs free energy of binding ($\\Delta G^\\circ$), which directly alters the equilibrium constant ($K_d = C^\\circ e^{\\Delta G^\\circ / RT}$, where $C^\\circ$ is the standard state concentration).\n    - Therefore, the value of $K_d$ becomes dependent on the genotype at the SNV locus. Let's denote the two alleles as $G_1$ and $G_2$. They result in proteins $P_1$ and $P_2$, with different dissociation constants, $K_{d,1}$ and $K_{d,2}$.\n    - The problem states that the true circulating protein concentration, $[P]_{total}$, is unchanged by the SNV. So, individuals with genotype $G_1$ have the same $[P]_{total}$ as individuals with genotype $G_2$.\n    - However, because $K_{d,1} \\neq K_{d,2}$, the concentration of the complex at equilibrium, $[C]_{eq}$, will differ between genotypes. Solving the mass action equations for $[C]_{eq}$ yields:\n      $$[C]_{eq} = \\frac{([P]_{total} + [A]_{total} + K_d) - \\sqrt{([P]_{total} + [A]_{total} + K_d)^2 - 4[P]_{total}[A]_{total}}}{2}$$\n      Since $[P]_{total}$ and the total aptamer concentration $[A]_{total}$ are constant across genotypes, a difference in $K_d$ will necessarily lead to a difference in $[C]_{eq}$.\n    - Since the assay signal is proportional to $[C]_{eq}$, the signal will be statistically associated with the genotype ($G_1$ vs. $G_2$). This statistical association is, by definition (ii), a QTL. It is \"spurious\" because it reflects a change in measurement affinity ($K_d$) rather than a change in the true biological quantity of interest ($[P]_{total}$).\n\n3.  **Direction of the Effect:**\n    - The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is a measure of the tendency of the complex to dissociate. A *higher* $K_d$ signifies *weaker* binding affinity.\n    - With weaker binding, for the same amounts of total protein and aptamer, less complex will be formed at equilibrium.\n    - Mathematically, we can inspect the derivative of $[C]_{eq}$ with respect to $K_d$. As shown by implicit differentiation of the quadratic form of the mass action law, $\\frac{d[C]_{eq}}{dK_d}$ is negative for any non-zero concentration of the complex.\n    - Therefore, an allele that **increases** $K_d$ results in a **decrease** in the equilibrium concentration of the complex, $[C]_{eq}$, and consequently a **decrease** in the measured assay signal.\n\n### Evaluation of Quality Control (QC) Options\n\nThe goal is to find QC strategies that mitigate spurious pQTLs caused by affinity artifacts while preserving true pQTLs driven by changes in protein abundance.\n\n**A. Exclude all cis associations where the sentinel variant, or any variant in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with it (pairwise $r^2 \\geq 0.8$), is a protein-altering variant (PAV) in the assayed protein, regardless of other evidence.**\nThis strategy targets the direct cause of the artifact—a protein-altering variant. By excluding any pQTL led by a PAV, it effectively removes a large class of potential affinity artifacts. However, the clause \"regardless of other evidence\" makes this a blunt and overly aggressive filter. A PAV could, in principle, cause a true abundance change (e.g., by affecting protein stability or secretion). This filter would incorrectly discard such true pQTLs without allowing for evidence to the contrary. While it serves to mitigate spurious associations, it does so at a high cost to preserving true ones, making it a suboptimal strategy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Perform conditional association analyses in cis that include any PAVs overlapping the protein’s coding sequence (particularly those mapping to the extracellular or known binding domain) as covariates; retain cis associations that persist after conditioning.**\nThis is a statistically sophisticated approach. If a pQTL's sentinel variant is merely in LD with an affinity-modifying PAV, its statistical signal is \"borrowed\" from the true causal PAV. By including the PAV's genotype as a covariate in the regression model, we can test if the sentinel variant has an association with the pQTL signal that is independent of the PAV's effect. If the signal is explained away by the PAV, it is likely an artifact. If it persists, it may be a genuine abundance QTL driven by a separate regulatory variant. This method directly addresses the artifact's genetic basis while attempting to statistically spare true signals, thus serving both parts of the goal.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Include top principal components (PCs) of genetic ancestry as covariates to account for stratification.**\nThis is a standard and essential QC step in all genome-wide association studies. It corrects for a different class of artifact: spurious associations arising from population structure, where both allele frequencies and trait values differ systematically between subgroups for reasons unrelated to the local genetic effect. However, it does not address the specific biological-technical artifact of an epitope change affecting aptamer binding affinity in cis. An affinity artifact will be present within any population and will not be corrected by accounting for ancestry PCs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Require orthogonal evidence that the signal tracks abundance rather than affinity, such as statistical colocalization with gene expression QTLs (eQTLs) in relevant tissues or replication of the allelic effect direction and magnitude on an orthogonal mass spectrometry (MS) platform.**\nThis strategy aims to validate the biological mechanism. If a pQTL is a true abundance QTL, its causal variant often also regulates gene expression, leading to a colocalizing eQTL signal. Furthermore, mass spectrometry-based proteomics is typically insensitive to protein folding and epitope artifacts. If a pQTL is replicated on an MS platform, it strongly supports a true change in protein abundance. By requiring such orthogonal evidence, this filter effectively separates abundance-driven QTLs (which are preserved) from affinity-driven artifacts (which are filtered out). This is a powerful and direct strategy for achieving the stated goal.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Drop all cis pQTLs within $\\pm 500\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ of the gene to avoid epitope artifacts entirely.**\nMost true pQTLs are caused by variants that regulate the gene's own expression or processing and are therefore located in cis (near the gene). This proposal would eliminate not only the spurious cis-acting affinity artifacts but also the vast majority of true cis-acting abundance pQTLs. This completely fails the second part of the goal, which is to *preserve* true associations. This is an example of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "4395334"}]}
