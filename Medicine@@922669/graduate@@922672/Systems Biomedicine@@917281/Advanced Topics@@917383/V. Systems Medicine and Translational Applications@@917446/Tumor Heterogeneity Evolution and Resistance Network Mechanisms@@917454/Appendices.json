The fraction of malignant cells (tumor purity) is $p=0.8$. In a specific genomic segment of the malignant clone, a Whole-Genome Duplication (WGD) event occurred, yielding a post-WGD total copy number $C=4$ in that segment for tumor cells. Consider two clonal Single-Nucleotide Variant (SNV) scenarios in that segment: (i) the SNV was acquired before WGD, so that after WGD it resides on $m=2$ of the $C=4$ copies; (ii) the SNV was acquired after WGD, so that it resides on $m=1$ of the $C=4$ copies. Assume unbiased short-read sequencing sampling from all alleles present in the mixture of tumor and normal cells, and that normal cells are diploid with no variant at this locus. Using first principles of mixture sampling and definitions of Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) as the expected fraction of reads bearing the variant allele among all reads at the locus, derive an expression for the expected VAF as a function of $p$, $C$, and $m$, and then compute the expected VAFs for the two scenarios described.

We can therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe Variant Allele Frequency ($\\text{VAF}$) is defined as the expected fraction of sequencing reads harboring a variant allele out of all reads covering that specific genomic locus. In a mixed sample of tumor and normal cells, the total pool of alleles at a locus is a weighted sum of alleles from both cell types.\n\nLet $p$ be the tumor purity, which is the fraction of malignant cells in the sample. Consequently, the fraction of non-malignant (normal) cells is $1-p$.\nThe normal cells are diploid, meaning they have a total copy number of $C_N = 2$ at any autosomal locus.\nThe tumor cells in the specified genomic segment have a total copy number of $C$.\nThe number of copies of the allele carrying the Single-Nucleotide Variant (SNV) in a tumor cell is $m$. Normal cells do not carry the variant.\n\nTo derive the expected VAF, we calculate the proportional contribution of variant alleles and total alleles from the mixture. Assuming unbiased sampling of DNA from all cells, the total number of alleles at the locus in the mixture is proportional to the sum of alleles from each population.\n\nThe total number of alleles, let's call its proportional measure $A_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of contributions from tumor cells and normal cells:\n$$ A_{\\text{total}} \\propto (\\text{fraction of tumor cells} \\times \\text{copies per tumor cell}) + (\\text{fraction of normal cells} \\times \\text{copies per normal cell}) $$\n$$ A_{\\text{total}} \\propto p \\cdot C + (1-p) \\cdot C_N $$\nGiven that normal cells are diploid, $C_N=2$. So, the total proportional number of alleles is:\n$$ A_{\\text{total}} \\propto pC + 2(1-p) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total proportional number of variant alleles, $A_{\\text{variant}}$. The SNV is only present in the tumor cells. In each tumor cell, there are $m$ copies of the allele with the variant. Normal cells contribute zero variant alleles.\n$$ A_{\\text{variant}} \\propto (\\text{fraction of tumor cells} \\times \\text{variant copies per tumor cell}) + (\\text{fraction of normal cells} \\times \\text{variant copies per normal cell}) $$\n$$ A_{\\text{variant}} \\propto p \\cdot m + (1-p) \\cdot 0 $$\n$$ A_{\\text{variant}} \\propto pm $$\n\nThe expected VAF is the ratio of the proportional number of variant alleles to the proportional total number of alleles:\n$$ \\text{VAF}(p, C, m) = \\frac{A_{\\text{variant}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{pm}{pC + 2(1-p)} $$\nThis is the general expression for the expected VAF as a function of tumor purity $p$, tumor-specific total copy number $C$, and variant allele copy number $m$.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the given scenarios using the provided values: $p=0.8$ and $C=4$.\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator, which is common to both scenarios:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = pC + 2(1-p) = (0.8)(4) + 2(1-0.8) = 3.2 + 2(0.2) = 3.2 + 0.4 = 3.6 $$\n\nScenario (i): The SNV was acquired before the Whole-Genome Duplication (WGD).\nIn a diploid cell (pre-WGD), a clonal heterozygous mutation occurs on one of the two homologous chromosomes. After WGD, all chromosomes are duplicated. Therefore, the single mutated allele is duplicated, resulting in $m=2$ variant alleles out of a total of $C=4$ alleles in the tumor cells.\nUsing $m=2$:\n$$ \\text{VAF}_{\\text{pre-WGD}} = \\frac{pm}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{(0.8)(2)}{3.6} = \\frac{1.6}{3.6} = \\frac{16}{36} = \\frac{4}{9} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.444444...$. Rounded to four significant figures, $\\text{VAF}_{\\text{pre-WGD}} = 0.4444$.\n\nScenario (ii): The SNV was acquired after the WGD.\nThe WGD has already occurred, so the tumor cells have $C=4$ copies of the chromosome segment. A new clonal mutation then occurs on only one of these four copies. Therefore, the number of variant alleles is $m=1$.\nUsing $m=1$:\n$$ \\text{VAF}_{\\text{post-WGD}} = \\frac{pm}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{(0.8)(1)}{3.6} = \\frac{0.8}{3.6} = \\frac{8}{36} = \\frac{2}{9} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.222222...$.

Mastering this technique is essential for quantifying the selective advantages or disadvantages conferred by specific mutations or cell states.", "problem": "You are modeling clonal lineage dynamics in a tumor using lineage barcoding. Assume a large initial barcode diversity of $10^5$ distinct barcodes and continuous-time Malthusian growth of each lineage. The goal is to infer fitness differences between lineages from observed barcode frequency trajectories over time, and compute selection coefficients.\n\nStart from the following fundamental bases:\n- Exponential (Malthusian) growth: for lineage $i$, the absolute count evolves as $n_i(t) = n_i(0)\\,\\exp(r_i t)$, where $r_i$ is the lineage-specific exponential growth rate (fitness in continuous time, also called the Malthusian parameter).\n- Frequencies are defined by $f_i(t) = n_i(t) / \\sum_j n_j(t)$ and satisfy $\\sum_i f_i(t) = 1$ for each time $t$.\n- Log-transformed frequencies provide an additive structure up to time-dependent normalization due to the unknown total population size.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, given times and observed barcode frequencies $f_i(t_k)$, infers the growth rates $r_i$ for all lineages by fitting a model that is consistent with the above principles. Because only frequencies (not absolute counts) are observed, your formulation must resolve the intrinsic non-identifiability by introducing and eliminating any time-dependent normalizations necessary to isolate lineage-specific growth terms. After obtaining inferred growth rates $r_i$, compute selection coefficients $s_i$ as lineage-specific deviations from the mean growth rate across all lineages in the same test case, that is $s_i = r_i - \\overline{r}$ where $\\overline{r}$ is the arithmetic mean of $\\{r_i\\}$ in that test case. Report $s_i$ in inverse days, as decimal numbers rounded to six decimal places.\n\nInput is fixed within your program (no user input). Use the following test suite. Each test case specifies a time grid (in days) and a matrix of observed barcode frequencies with rows corresponding to lineages and columns to time points. Each column of a frequency matrix sums to $1$ up to rounding error, and all frequencies are strictly positive. Your program must fit the model to each test case independently and output the list of selection coefficients for each test case.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Test Case A (happy-path; three lineages with distinct growth): times $t = [0, 2, 4, 6]$ days, frequencies\n  - Lineage $1$: $[0.333333, 0.334502, 0.334942, 0.335617]$\n  - Lineage $2$: $[0.266667, 0.272423, 0.278888, 0.285096]$\n  - Lineage $3$: $[0.400000, 0.393075, 0.386170, 0.379287]$\n- Test Case B (boundary; identical growth leading to time-invariant frequencies): times $t = [0, 1, 2, 3]$ days, frequencies\n  - Lineage $1$: $[0.500000, 0.500000, 0.500000, 0.500000]$\n  - Lineage $2$: $[0.300000, 0.300000, 0.300000, 0.300000]$\n  - Lineage $3$: $[0.200000, 0.200000, 0.200000, 0.200000]$\n- Test Case C (edge; rare but fast-growing lineage among four lineages): times $t = [0, 3, 6]$ days, frequencies\n  - Lineage $1$: $[0.142835, 0.141609, 0.140375]$\n  - Lineage $2$: $[0.142835, 0.139501, 0.136226]$\n  - Lineage $3$: $[0.000143, 0.000146, 0.000149]$\n  - Lineage $4$: $[0.714187, 0.718744, 0.723250]$\n\nRequirements:\n1. Derivation basis: Begin from $n_i(t) = n_i(0)\\,\\exp(r_i t)$ and the frequency definition $f_i(t) = n_i(t)/\\sum_j n_j(t)$. Introduce whatever time-dependent normalizations are required to account for unknown total population sizes, ensuring identifiability of the lineage-specific parameters from $f_i(t_k)$ alone. Use a principled estimation method grounded in these bases (for example, a least-squares fit in the log-frequency domain that handles the time-dependent normalization).\n2. Output specification: For each test case, compute the list of selection coefficients $s_i = r_i - \\overline{r}$ in inverse days. Round each $s_i$ to six decimal places. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the three lists of selection coefficients (for Test Cases A, B, and C) as a single Python-style list of lists with fixed-point formatting to six decimals, for example: [[sA1,sA2,sA3],[sB1,sB2,sB3],[sC1,sC2,sC3,sC4]].\n3.

The final printout must be a single line with the precise formatting described above (no extra text).", "solution": "The problem requires the inference of lineage-specific growth rates and corresponding selection coefficients from time-series data of clonal frequencies in a tumor. The solution is founded on the principles of Malthusian growth and is derived to address the inherent non-identifiability of absolute growth rates when only frequency data is available.\n\nThe starting point is the model of exponential growth for each clonal lineage $i$, where its absolute population size $n_i(t)$ at time $t$ is given by:\n$$n_i(t) = n_i(0) e^{r_i t}$$\nHere, $n_i(0)$ is the initial population size of lineage $i$ at time $t=0$, and $r_i$ is the Malthusian parameter, representing the lineage-specific continuous-time growth rate, or fitness.\n\nThe observed data consists of frequencies $f_i(t)$, not absolute counts. The frequency of lineage $i$ is defined as its proportion of the total population:\n$$f_i(t) = \\frac{n_i(t)}{\\sum_j n_j(t)} = \\frac{n_i(0) e^{r_i t}}{\\sum_j n_j(0) e^{r_j t}}$$\nA critical property of this formulation is that the frequencies $f_i(t)$ are invariant to a uniform shift in all growth rates. If we replace each $r_j$ with $r'_j = r_j + c$ for any constant $c$, the frequencies remain unchanged:\n$$f_i(t) = \\frac{n_i(0) e^{(r_i+c) t}}{\\sum_j n_j(0) e^{(r_j+c) t}} = \\frac{n_i(0) e^{r_i t} e^{ct}}{e^{ct} \\sum_j n_j(0) e^{r_j t}} = \\frac{n_i(0) e^{r_i t}}{\\sum_j n_j(0) e^{r_j t}}$$\nThis demonstrates that the absolute growth rates $r_i$ are not identifiable from frequency data alone. Only the differences between growth rates, $r_i-r_j$, can be determined.\n\nTo isolate these identifiable quantities, we can analyze the ratio of frequencies between any two lineages, $i$ and $k$. Taking the natural logarithm of this ratio effectively eliminates the common denominator which encapsulates the unknown total population size:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{f_i(t)}{f_k(t)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i(0) e^{r_i t}}{n_k(0) e^{r_k t}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i(0)}{n_k(0)}\\right) + (r_i - r_k)t$$\nRecognizing that $f_i(0) = n_i(0)/\\sum_j n_j(0)$, the first term can be expressed in terms of initial frequencies: $\\ln(n_i(0)/n_k(0)) = \\ln(f_i(0)/f_k(0))$. Thus, we have a linear relationship with respect to time $t$:\n$$y_i(t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_i(t)}{f_k(t)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_i(0)}{f_k(0)}\\right) + (r_i - r_k)t$$\nThis equation has the form of a line, $y=a+bt$, where the variable $y_i(t)$ is the log-ratio of frequencies, the independent variable is time $t$, the intercept $a$ is the log-ratio of initial frequencies, and the slope $b$ is the relative growth rate, $r_i - r_k$.\n\nThis formulation provides a direct path to estimating the relative growth rates. We select a reference lineage, for instance $k=1$, and for each other lineage $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, N\\}$, we can estimate the slope $m_i = r_i - r_1$ by performing a simple linear regression on the observed data points $(t_j, \\ln[f_i(t_j)/f_1(t_j)])$. For the reference lineage itself ($i=1$), the relative growth rate is by definition $r_1 - r_1 = 0$. Let $\\hat{m}_i$ be the estimated slope for lineage $i$ relative to lineage $1$. We thus obtain a vector of estimated relative growth rates $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}} = [\\hat{m}_1, \\hat{m}_2, \\dots, \\hat{m}_N]$, where $\\hat{m}_1 = 0$.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of selection coefficients, defined as $s_i = r_i - \\bar{r}$, where $\\bar{r} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_j r_j$ is the mean growth rate. We can express the estimated selection coefficient $\\hat{s}_i$ in terms of the estimated relative rates $\\hat{m}_i$. An estimate for $r_i$ can be written as $\\hat{r}_i = \\hat{r}_1 + \\hat{m}_i$, where $\\hat{r}_1$ is the unknown absolute growth rate of the reference lineage. The estimated mean growth rate is then:\n$$\\bar{\\hat{r}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N \\hat{r}_j = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N (\\hat{r}_1 + \\hat{m}_j) = \\hat{r}_1 + \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N \\hat{m}_j = \\hat{r}_1 + \\bar{\\hat{m}}$$\nThe estimated selection coefficient for lineage $i$ is:\n$$\\hat{s}_i = \\hat{r}_i - \\bar{\\hat{r}} = (\\hat{r}_1 + \\hat{m}_i) - (\\hat{r}_1 + \\bar{\\hat{m}}) = \\hat{m}_i - \\bar{\\hat{m}}$$\nThis final expression for $\\hat{s}_i$ is independent of the unknown $\\hat{r}_1$ and the choice of reference lineage, providing a fully identifiable and computable quantity.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, take the time points $T = [t_1, \\dots, t_M]$ and the frequency matrix $F$, where $F_{ij} = f_i(t_j)$.\n2.  Select a reference lineage (e.g., the first lineage, $i=1$).\n3.  For each lineage $i=2, \\dots, N$, compute the log-ratio of its frequencies to the reference lineage's frequencies at each time point: $y_{ij} = \\ln(F_{ij}/F_{1j})$.\n4.  For each lineage $i=2, \\dots, N$, perform a simple linear regression of the vector $(y_{i1}, \\dots, y_{iM})$ against the time vector $(t_1, \\dots, t_M)$. The slope of this regression provides the estimate $\\hat{m}_i = \\widehat{r_i-r_1}$.\n5.  Construct the vector of relative growth rates $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}} = [0, \\hat{m}_2, \\dots, \\hat{m}_N]$.\n6.  Compute the mean of this vector: $\\bar{\\hat{m}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N \\hat{m}_j$.\n7.  Compute the selection coefficient for each lineage as $\\hat{s}_i = \\hat{m}_i - \\bar{\\hat{m}}$.\n8.
