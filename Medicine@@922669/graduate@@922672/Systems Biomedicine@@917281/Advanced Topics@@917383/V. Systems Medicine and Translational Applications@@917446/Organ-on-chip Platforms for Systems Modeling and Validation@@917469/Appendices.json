The assumptions of steady, fully developed, laminar, incompressible flow in a high-aspect-ratio channel ($w \\gg h$) are consistent and allow for a simplified analysis using the plane Poiseuille flow model. All provided parameters are physically realistic for a microfluidics experiment.\n\nThe governing equation for steady, fully developed, incompressible viscous flow in a channel, where the flow is in the $x$-direction, is derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. With velocity $\\mathbf{u} = (u(y,z), 0, 0)$, the momentum equation in the $x$-direction simplifies to:\n$$0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and the coordinates are $y$ across the height and $z$ across the width. The pressure gradient, $\\frac{dp}{dx}$, is constant for fully developed flow.\n\nThe problem specifies a geometry where the width $w$ is much greater than the height $h$ ($w \\gg h$). This allows us to use the parallel-plate approximation, which assumes that the velocity gradients across the width, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$, are negligible compared to those across the height, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$, for the majority of the flow field away from the short side walls. The governing equation thus reduces to an ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\nWe set up the coordinate system with $y=0$ at the bottom wall and $y=h$ at the top wall.

In vivo, physiological shear stress in human arteries typically ranges from $1$ to $7$ Pa ($10-70$ dyn/cm$^2$). In vitro studies have established that sustained laminar shear stress above a threshold of approximately $0.5 - 1$ Pa ($5-10$ dyn/cm$^2$) causes ECs to elongate and align in the direction of flow. Therefore, the value computed here is well within the physiological range for arterial flow and is expected to induce a strong alignment response in the cultured endothelial cells, making this OoC setup suitable for studying flow-mediated vascular mechanobiology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.444}$$", "id": "4371160"}, {"introduction": "Beyond emulating the physical environment, OoC platforms serve as powerful tools for systems modeling, particularly in pharmacokinetics. A common approach is to represent an organ or tissue as a \"well-mixed compartment\" and model how a drug's concentration changes over time due to inflow, outflow, and metabolic clearance. This exercise focuses on deriving and solving the fundamental ordinary differential equation (ODE) that governs this process, providing a cornerstone for understanding and predicting drug dynamics within an engineered biological system.

The chamber is assumed to be perfectly mixed due to engineered recirculation, so that the solute concentration is spatially uniform and given by $C(t)$ inside the chamber at time $t$. The solute undergoes first-order clearance within the chamber with rate constant $k$ (units of $\\text{s}^{-1}$), which phenomenologically aggregates metabolic consumption and irreversible binding. Outflow leaves the chamber at the same volumetric rate $Q$ and carries solute at the chamber concentration $C(t)$. Prior to $t=0$, the inflow contains no solute, i.e., $C_{\\text{in}}(t)=0$ for $t<0$, and the chamber is initially solute-free, $C(0)=0$. At $t=0$, the inflow concentration is stepped to a constant value $C_{0}$ and held thereafter, i.e., $C_{\\text{in}}(t)=C_{0}$ for $t\\ge 0$. \n\nUsing the conservation of mass as the fundamental base, and treating the chamber as a single well-mixed compartment, derive the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) governing $C(t)$ and solve it to obtain an explicit analytic expression for $C(t)$ for $t\\ge 0$ in terms of $V$, $Q$, $k$, $C_{0}$, and $t$.

For the single, well-mixed chamber, the rate of change of the mass of solute within the chamber is equal to the rate at which solute mass enters, minus the rate at which it leaves, and minus the rate at which it is cleared.\n\nLet $M(t)$ be the total mass of the solute in the chamber at time $t$. Given a uniform concentration $C(t)$ in a fixed liquid volume $V$, the mass is $M(t) = V C(t)$. The rate of change of mass is therefore $\\frac{dM}{dt} = V \\frac{dC}{dt}$, since $V$ is a constant.\n\nThe individual rates contributing to this change are:\n1.  Rate of mass inflow: The solute enters at a volumetric flow rate $Q$ with a concentration $C_{\\text{in}}(t)$. The rate of mass inflow is $Q C_{\\text{in}}(t)$. For $t \\ge 0$, this is given as $Q C_{0}$.\n2.  Rate of mass outflow: The perfectly mixed assumption implies the outflow concentration is identical to the chamber concentration, $C(t)$. Thus, the rate of mass outflow is $Q C(t)$.\n3.  Rate of mass clearance: The clearance is a first-order process with rate constant $k$. This means the rate of clearance is proportional to the total mass of solute present in the chamber, $M(t)$. The rate of mass clearance is $k M(t) = k V C(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms into a mass balance equation:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of mass inflow}) - (\\text{Rate of mass outflow}) - (\\text{Rate of mass clearance}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for each term:\n$$ V \\frac{dC}{dt} = Q C_{0} - Q C(t) - k V C(t) $$\nThis equation is valid for $t \\ge 0$.
