A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes a single cycle of selection on four haploid genotypes with equal initial frequencies. According to the provided principles, the post-selection frequency of a genotype $ij$, denoted $f'_{ij}$, is proportional to its absolute fitness, $w_{ij}$, because the initial frequencies $f_{ij}$ were equal for all $ij \\in \\{00, 10, 01, 11\\}$.\n\nThe post-selection frequencies are estimated from the final counts, $N_{ij}$:\n$$f'_{ij} = \\frac{N_{ij}}{N_{total}}$$\nwhere $N_{total} = \\sum N_{ij} = 9100$.\nSince $f'_{ij} \\propto w_{ij}$, it follows that $w_{ij}$ is proportional to the observed count $N_{ij}$.\n\nWe are asked to estimate the relative fitnesses, $W_{ij}$, by scaling such that the fitness of the reference genotype $A0B0$ is $1$. Let us denote this reference genotype as $00$.\n$$W_{ij} = \\frac{w_{ij}}{w_{00}}$$\nDue to the proportionality $w_{ij} \\propto N_{ij}$, we can write:\n$$W_{ij} = \\frac{k N_{ij}}{k N_{00}} = \\frac{N_{ij}}{N_{00}}$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\n\nThe provided counts are:\n$N_{00} = 2000$ (for genotype $A0B0$)\n$N_{10} = 2400$ (for genotype $A1B0$)\n$N_{01} = 2200$ (for genotype $A0B1$)\n$N_{11} = 2500$ (for genotype $A1B1$)\n\nWe can now calculate the relative fitnesses:\n$$W_{00} = \\frac{N_{00}}{N_{00}} = \\frac{2000}{2000} = 1$$\n$$W_{10} = \\frac{N_{10}}{N_{00}} = \\frac{2400}{2000} = 1.2$$\n$$W_{01} = \\frac{N_{01}}{N_{00}} = \\frac{2200}{2000} = 1.1$$\n$$W_{11} = \\frac{N_{11}}{N_{00}} = \\frac{2500}{2000} = 1.25$$\n\nNext, we apply the two-locus additive fitness model. The single-locus effect $a$ of allele $1$ at locus $A$ and the effect $b$ of allele $1$ at locus $B$ are defined as the fitness increases over the background genotype $A0B0$.\nThe fitness of the single mutant $A1B0$ is given by:\n$$W_{10} = W_{00} + a$$\nThe fitness of the single mutant $A0B1$ is given by:\n$$W_{01} = W_{00} + b$$\nThe fitness of the double mutant $A1B1$ includes the epistasis term $\\epsilon$, which measures the deviation from the purely additive expectation:\n$$W_{11} = W_{00} + a + b + \\epsilon$$\n\nUsing the calculated relative fitnesses, we can infer the parameters $a$, $b$, and $\\epsilon$.\nFrom the equation for $W_{10}$:\n$$a = W_{10} - W_{00} = 1.2 - 1 = 0.2$$\nFrom the equation for $W_{01}$:\n$$b = W_{01} - W_{00} = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1$$\n\nNow, we use the equation for $W_{11}$ to solve for the epistasis coefficient $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\epsilon = W_{11} - (W_{00} + a + b)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\\epsilon = 1.25 - (1 + 0.2 + 0.1)$$\n$$\\epsilon = 1.25 - 1.3$$\n$$\\epsilon = -0.05$$\n\nThe sign of the epistasis coefficient $\\epsilon$ determines the nature of the gene interaction.\n- If $\\epsilon > 0$, the mutations have a combined effect that is greater than the sum of their individual effects. This is called synergistic or positive epistasis.\n- If $\\epsilon < 0$, the mutations have a combined effect that is less than the sum of their individual effects. This is called antagonistic or negative epistasis.\n- If $\\epsilon = 0$, the effects are purely additive.\n\nIn this case, $\\epsilon = -0.05$, which is negative. This indicates antagonistic epistasis. The combined fitness benefit of acquiring both mutations ($1.25$ relative to the background) is less than the sum of the benefits of the individual mutations ($1 + (1.2-1) + (1.1-1) = 1.3$).\n\nThe problem asks for the final numerical answer for $\\epsilon$ rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $-0.05$. To express this with four significant figures, we can write it in scientific notation.\n$$\\epsilon = -0.05 = -5.000 \\times 10^{-2}$$\nThis representation has four significant figures ($5, 0, 0, 0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-5.000 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "4390293"}]}
