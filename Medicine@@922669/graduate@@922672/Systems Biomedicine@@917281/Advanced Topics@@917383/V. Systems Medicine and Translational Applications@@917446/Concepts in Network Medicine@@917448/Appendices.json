In network medicine, one commonly studies how localized perturbations propagate along routes that minimize topological distance, and how certain nodes may act as bottlenecks that constrain these propagations. Using the standard definition of betweenness centrality for undirected simple graphs—where for each unordered pair of distinct nodes $s,t$ with $s \\neq C \\neq t$, one counts the fraction of shortest paths between $s$ and $t$ on which node $C$ lies strictly between $s$ and $t$, and then normalizes by the total number of such unordered pairs—compute the betweenness centrality of node $C$. Express your final answer as a reduced rational number. Based on the computed value, justify whether $C$ serves as a bottleneck for shortest-path-based perturbation propagation in this network, grounding your reasoning in foundational concepts of network medicine without invoking empirical shortcuts or specialized heuristics beyond shortest-path considerations.", "solution": "The network is a simple undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V=\\{A,B,C,D,E\\}$ and $E=\\{(A,B),(B,C),(C,D),(D,E),(A,C)\\}$. In such graphs, a shortest path between two nodes $s$ and $t$ is any path with the minimal number of edges connecting $s$ to $t$. Betweenness centrality of a node is defined, for an undirected graph, by summing over unordered pairs of distinct nodes $s,t \\in V \\setminus \\{C\\}$ the fraction of shortest paths between $s$ and $t$ that include node $C$ as an internal node (that is, $C$ lies strictly between $s$ and $t$), and then normalizing by the number of unordered pairs of nodes that exclude $C$.\n\nWe proceed as follows. First, list all unordered pairs $\\{s,t\\}$ with $s,t \\in V \\setminus \\{C\\}$. Since $V \\setminus \\{C\\}=\\{A,B,D,E\\}$ has $4$ elements, the number of unordered pairs is $\\binom{4}{2}=6$.
