Transitions out of state $n$ can occur to state $n+1$ (a birth event) with rate $\\lambda$, and to state $n-1$ (a death event) with rate $\\mu n$. The CME for $n \\ge 1$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_n(t)}{dt} = \\lambda p_{n-1}(t) + \\mu(n+1)p_{n+1}(t) - (\\lambda + \\mu n)p_n(t)\n$$\nFor the boundary state $n=0$, there can be no transitions to a state with negative damage counts ($n=-1$). Transitions into state $0$ occur from state $1$ (a death event) with rate $\\mu \\cdot 1 = \\mu$. Transitions out of state $0$ occur to state $1$ (a birth event) with rate $\\lambda$. The CME for $n=0$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_0(t)}{dt} = \\mu p_1(t) - \\lambda p_0(t)\n$$\nAt steady state (or stationarity), the probability distribution no longer changes with time, so $\\frac{dp_n(t)}{dt} = 0$ for all $n$. We denote the stationary probabilities as $p_n^{(\\mathrm{ss})}$. The set of equations becomes:\nFor $n=0$:\n$$\n0 = \\mu p_1^{(\\mathrm{ss})} - \\lambda p_0^{(\\mathrm{ss})} \\implies \\mu p_1^{(\\mathrm{ss})} = \\lambda p_0^{(\\mathrm{ss})}\n$$\nFor $n \\ge 1$:\n$$\n0 = \\lambda p_{n-1}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} + \\mu(n+1)p_{n+1}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} - (\\lambda + \\mu n)p_n^{(\\mathrm{ss})}\n$$\nThese are the steady-state balance equations.

The probability density function (PDF) of $Z$ is given by:\n$$f_{Z}(z) = \\frac{z^{k-1} \\exp(-z/\\lambda)}{\\lambda^{k} \\Gamma(k)} = \\frac{z^{(1/\\theta)-1} \\exp(-z/\\theta)}{\\theta^{1/\\theta} \\Gamma(1/\\theta)}, \\quad \\text{for } z  0$$\n\n**Step 2: Define Conditional Survival and Baseline Hazard**\nThe relationship between a hazard function $h(t)$ and the corresponding survival function $S(t)$ is given by $S(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} h(u)\\,du\\right) = \\exp(-H(t))$, where $H(t)$ is the cumulative hazard.\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline cumulative hazard, $H_{0}(t)$, corresponding to the baseline Gompertz hazard $h_{0}(t) = a\\,\\exp(b\\,t)$:\n$$H_{0}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} h_{0}(u)\\,du = \\int_{0}^{t} a\\,\\exp(b\\,u)\\,du = \\frac{a}{b} \\left[ \\exp(b\\,u) \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{a}{b} (\\exp(b\\,t) - 1)$$\nThe conditional hazard for an individual with frailty $Z=z$ is $h(t \\mid Z=z) = z\\,h_{0}(t)$. The corresponding conditional cumulative hazard is:\n$$H(t \\mid Z=z) = \\int_{0}^{t} h(u \\mid Z=z)\\,du = \\int_{0}^{t} z\\,h_{0}(u)\\,du = z \\int_{0}^{t} h_{0}(u)\\,du = z\\,H_{0}(t)$$\nTherefore, the conditional survival function is:\n$$S(t \\mid Z=z) = \\exp(-H(t \\mid Z=z)) = \\exp(-z\\,H_{0}(t))$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Population Survival Function**\nThe population survival function, $S_{p}(t)$, is the expected value of the conditional survival function, averaged over the entire population's distribution of frailty. This is an application of the law of total probability.\n$$S_{p}(t) = E[S(t \\mid Z)] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S(t \\mid Z=z) f_{Z}(z)\\,dz$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S(t \\mid Z=z)$ and $f_{Z}(z)$:\n$$S_{p}(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-z\\,H_{0}(t)) \\left( \\frac{z^{(1/\\theta)-1} \\exp(-z/\\theta)}{\\theta^{1/\\theta} \\Gamma(1/\\theta)} \\right) dz$$\nThis integral is precisely the definition of the moment-generating function (MGF) of the random variable $Z$, evaluated at the point $s = -H_{0}(t)$. The MGF for a gamma-distributed random variable $Z \\sim \\Gamma(k, \\lambda)$ is given by $M_{Z}(s) = E[\\exp(sZ)] = (1 - \\lambda s)^{-k}$, defined for $s  1/\\lambda$.\nIn our case, $k=1/\\theta$ and $\\lambda=\\theta$, so the MGF is $M_{Z}(s) = (1 - \\theta s)^{-1/\\theta}$. Evaluating this at $s = -H_{0}(t)$:\n$$S_{p}(t) = M_{Z}(-H_{0}(t)) = (1 - \\theta(-H_{0}(t)))^{-1/\\theta} = (1 + \\theta H_{0}(t))^{-1/\\theta}$$\nWe can now substitute the expression for $H_{0}(t)$:\n$$S_{p}(t) = \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{a}{b}(\\exp(b\\,t) - 1)\\right)^{-1/\\theta}$$\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Population Hazard Function**\nThe population hazard function $h_{p}(t)$ is related to the population survival function $S_{p}(t)$ by the formula $h_{p}(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S_{p}(t))$.\nFirst, we find the natural logarithm of $S_{p}(t)$:\n$$\\ln(S_{p}(t)) = \\ln\\left((1 + \\theta H_{0}(t))^{-1/\\theta}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\ln(1 + \\theta H_{0}(t))$$\nNext, we differentiate this expression with respect to $t$ using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S_{p}(t)) = -\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\ln(1 + \\theta H_{0}(t)) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S_{p}(t)) = -\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\theta H_{0}(t)} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} (1 + \\theta H_{0}(t))$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S_{p}(t)) = -\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\theta H_{0}(t)} \\cdot \\theta \\frac{d H_{0}(t)}{dt}$$\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus, $\\frac{d H_{0}(t)}{dt} = h_{0}(t)$. The factor of $\\theta$ in the numerator and denominator cancels:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S_{p}(t)) = -\\frac{h_{0}(t)}{1 + \\theta H_{0}(t)}$$\nFinally, the population hazard is:\n$$h_{p}(t) = - \\left( -\\frac{h_{0}(t)}{1 + \\theta H_{0}(t)} \\right) = \\frac{h_{0}(t)}{1 + \\theta H_{0}(t)}$$\nSubstituting the explicit expressions for $h_{0}(t)=a\\,\\exp(b\\,t)$ and $H_{0}(t)=\\frac{a}{b}(\\exp(b\\,t)-1)$ gives the final closed-form result for the population hazard:\n$$h_{p}(t) = \\frac{a\\,\\exp(b\\,t)}{1 + \\theta \\frac{a}{b}(\\exp(b\\,t) - 1)}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{a\\,\\exp(b\\,t)}{1 + \\frac{a\\,\\theta}{b}(\\exp(b\\,t) - 1)}}$$", "id": "4390008"}]}
