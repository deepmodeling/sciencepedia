## Introduction
Single-cell systems biology has revolutionized our ability to dissect complex biological systems by providing a high-resolution view of [cellular heterogeneity](@entry_id:262569). However, unlocking biological insights from this data presents a formidable challenge, requiring a deep understanding of both the underlying biological processes and the sophisticated computational methods used for analysis. This article addresses this need by providing a comprehensive guide to the core principles that govern the generation and interpretation of single-cell data. It bridges the gap between raw, noisy measurements and a robust, mechanistic understanding of cellular function.

Across three distinct chapters, this article will equip you with the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, lays the theoretical groundwork, exploring the stochastic origins of single-cell data, the critical steps of normalization and [batch correction](@entry_id:192689), and the methods used to reduce dimensionality and infer [cellular dynamics](@entry_id:747181) like pseudotime and RNA velocity. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates how these principles are applied to solve real-world biological problems, from defining cell states and modeling development to inferring causal [gene regulatory networks](@entry_id:150976) and integrating multi-omic and spatial data. Finally, the third chapter, **Hands-On Practices**, provides practical, problem-based exercises that solidify these concepts, challenging you to apply your knowledge to common scenarios in experimental design and data analysis. By progressing through these sections, you will build a robust framework for critically analyzing and interpreting single-cell data to drive biological discovery.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the core principles and mechanisms that underpin the analysis of single-cell data. We will begin by examining the stochastic processes that govern both the biology of gene expression and its measurement, establishing a theoretical foundation for understanding single-cell count data. Subsequently, we will explore the critical steps of [data normalization](@entry_id:265081) and [batch effect correction](@entry_id:269846), which are essential for mitigating technical artifacts. We then transition to methods for dimensionality reduction, which allow for the visualization and interpretation of the complex, high-dimensional structures within these datasets. Finally, we will investigate advanced techniques for inferring [cellular dynamics](@entry_id:747181), including pseudotemporal ordering and RNA velocity, which transform static snapshots into models of biological processes over time.

### The Stochastic Origins of Single-Cell Data

At the heart of [single-cell systems biology](@entry_id:269071) is the recognition that gene expression is an inherently stochastic process. The number of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules for a given gene within a single cell is not a fixed quantity but rather fluctuates over time due to the probabilistic nature of the underlying biochemical reactions. Understanding this stochasticity is the first step toward building rigorous models from single-cell data.

#### Intrinsic Noise: From Poissonian Synthesis to Transcriptional Bursting

The simplest model of gene expression treats it as a linear [birth-death process](@entry_id:168595). In this framework, mRNA molecules are synthesized at a constant rate $k$ and each molecule is independently degraded with a first-order rate constant $\gamma$. These dynamics can be described by a **Chemical Master Equation (CME)**, which provides a full probabilistic description of the system. From this CME, one can derive the time evolution of the moments of the mRNA distribution. At steady state, the mean molecule count is $\mathbb{E}[n] = k/\gamma$ and the variance is $\operatorname{Var}[n] = k/\gamma$. A key metric for characterizing the variability of a distribution is the **Fano factor**, defined as the [variance-to-mean ratio](@entry_id:262869), $F = \operatorname{Var}[n]/\mathbb{E}[n]$. For this simple birth-death process, the Fano factor is exactly $1$ [@problem_id:4377601]. A Fano factor of unity is the hallmark of a **Poisson distribution**, which this model indeed follows at steady state.

However, when experimental techniques like single-molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) were used to count mRNA molecules in individual cells, a consistent observation emerged: for most genes, the variance in mRNA counts was significantly larger than the mean, yielding Fano factors much greater than one ($F \gg 1$). This **super-Poissonian** noise directly falsified the simple model of constant-rate transcription and pointed to a more complex production mechanism [@problem_id:4377601].

The prevailing model that explains this observation is the **two-state model of transcription**, also known as the **[telegraph model](@entry_id:187386)** [@problem_id:4377585]. This model posits that a gene's promoter stochastically switches between an inactive state ($G_0$) and an active state ($G_1$). Transcription, the synthesis of mRNA, can only occur when the promoter is in the active state. The full system involves several reaction channels:
- Promoter activation: $G_0 \to G_1$ with rate $k_{\text{on}}$
- Promoter deactivation: $G_1 \to G_0$ with rate $k_{\text{off}}$
- Transcription: $\varnothing \to \text{mRNA}$ with rate $r$ (only when in state $G_1$)
- mRNA degradation: $\text{mRNA} \to \varnothing$ with rate $\delta$

The dynamics of this system are governed by a CME that tracks the probability of being in a state defined by both the promoter status and the mRNA count. The instantaneous probability of a reaction occurring in a small time interval $\mathrm{d}t$ is given by its **[propensity function](@entry_id:181123)** multiplied by $\mathrm{d}t$. For example, the propensity for mRNA degradation is $\delta \cdot n$, where $n$ is the current mRNA count, reflecting first-order [mass-action kinetics](@entry_id:187487) [@problem_id:4377585].

When promoter deactivation is much faster than activation ($k_{\text{off}} \gg k_{\text{on}}$), the gene spends most of its time in the inactive state, punctuated by short, infrequent periods of activity. During these active periods, mRNA molecules are produced in rapid succession, a phenomenon known as **[transcriptional bursting](@entry_id:156205)**. By making a [time-scale separation](@entry_id:195461) approximation (specifically, assuming the active periods are short relative to the mRNA lifetime, $k_{\text{off}} \gg \delta$), one can mathematically show that the [steady-state distribution](@entry_id:152877) of mRNA counts follows a **Negative Binomial (NB) distribution** [@problem_id:4377615].

The NB distribution is described by two parameters, often interpreted as a burst size and a [burst frequency](@entry_id:267105). For the [telegraph model](@entry_id:187386), the steady-state mean, variance, and Fano factor of mRNA counts can be derived as:
- Mean: $\mathbb{E}[n] = \frac{k_{\text{on}}r}{\delta k_{\text{off}}}$
- Variance: $\operatorname{Var}[n] = \mathbb{E}[n] \left( 1 + \frac{r}{k_{\text{off}}} \right)$
- Fano Factor: $F = 1 + \frac{r}{k_{\text{off}}}$

The term $r/k_{\text{off}}$ represents the mean number of mRNA molecules produced during a single active period (the mean [burst size](@entry_id:275620)). Since this term is positive, the Fano factor is always greater than $1$, consistent with experimental observations of super-Poissonian noise. This model thus provides a fundamental biological mechanism for the high cell-to-cell variability seen in single-cell data [@problem_id:4377615].

#### Technical Noise: The Role of Unique Molecular Identifiers

Beyond the intrinsic [biological noise](@entry_id:269503) from bursting, the process of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) introduces its own technical noise. A critical step in most scRNA-seq protocols is the amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) via the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This amplification is necessary to generate enough material for sequencing, but it is notoriously biased. Different molecules amplify with different efficiencies, meaning that if one simply counts sequencing reads, the final counts will be a distorted reflection of the original molecular abundances.

To overcome this, modern protocols employ **Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs)**. A UMI is a short, random nucleotide sequence that is attached to each individual cDNA molecule during reverse transcription, *before* the PCR amplification step. Every copy generated during PCR from a single original molecule will therefore share the same UMI. After sequencing, bioinformatic processing collapses all reads that share the same UMI down to a single count. This **deduplication** process makes the final count insensitive to the variable amplification efficiencies [@problem_id:4377563].

The use of UMIs elegantly transforms the complex and biased amplification process into a much simpler statistical model. For each of the $N$ original mRNA molecules of a gene in a cell, there is a probability $p$ that it is successfully captured, reverse transcribed, and tagged with a UMI. If it is captured, it will be counted exactly once, regardless of how many PCR duplicates are sequenced (assuming sufficient [sequencing depth](@entry_id:178191)). If it is not captured, it is counted zero times. This is a **Bernoulli trial** for each molecule.

Therefore, the final UMI count for a gene is the sum of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials, which follows a **Binomial distribution**, $\text{Binomial}(N, p)$. UMIs do not eliminate noise—the stochasticity of molecular capture remains—but they crucially remove the non-linear and difficult-to-[model bias](@entry_id:184783) of PCR, replacing it with a well-understood Binomial sampling process. This provides a much cleaner, more quantitative starting point for downstream analysis [@problem_id:4377563].

### Data Normalization: Accounting for Technical Confounders

After obtaining UMI counts, the resulting count matrix is still not directly comparable across cells. This is because technical factors, such as the efficiency of cell lysis, reverse transcription, and library capture, vary from cell to cell. A cell with higher capture efficiency will yield more UMIs across all genes, even if its biological expression state is identical to a cell with lower efficiency. Correcting for these technical confounders is a critical preprocessing step known as **normalization**.

#### The Rationale for Normalization: Size Factors and Scaling

The total number of UMI counts detected in a cell is often referred to as its **library size**. Differences in library size are a primary source of technical variation. The central goal of normalization is to adjust the raw counts so that these technical differences no longer obscure the underlying biological differences between cells.

A common [generative model](@entry_id:167295) for UMI counts $c_{gi}$ (for gene $g$ in cell $i$) posits that the expected count is a product of a cell-specific technical component and a biological component: $\mathbb{E}[c_{gi}] = s_i \theta_{gi}$. Here, $s_i$ is a cell-specific scalar known as the **size factor**, which captures the combined effect of sequencing depth and capture efficiency for cell $i$. The term $\theta_{gi}$ represents the true biological quantity of interest, such as the relative abundance of the transcript in the cell's [transcriptome](@entry_id:274025) [@problem_id:4377531]. Normalization aims to estimate and "divide out" the effect of $s_i$ to yield values that are proportional to $\theta_{gi}$ and are thus comparable across cells.

#### Global-Scaling versus Gene-Specific Approaches

The most straightforward normalization methods fall into the category of **global-scaling**. These methods apply a single multiplicative correction to all genes within a cell. The simplest example is **library size normalization**, where the raw count for each gene in a cell is divided by that cell's total UMI count (and often multiplied by a scale factor, like a million, to yield Counts-Per-Million or CPM). In this case, the library size itself serves as an estimate for the size factor $s_i$ [@problem_id:4377531].

Global-scaling methods operate on the key assumption that technical factors affect all genes proportionally within a cell. While simple and often effective, this assumption can be violated. One major issue is **composition bias**, which occurs when a small number of highly expressed genes change their abundance dramatically across cell types. This can alter the total UMI pool, causing the library size to no longer be a reliable proxy for the technical scaling factor for all other genes. More sophisticated methods estimate size factors using strategies that are more robust to composition bias, for instance by pooling counts across many similar cells to deconvolve the size factors. Under ideal conditions where composition bias is negligible and size factors are estimated accurately, global-scaling yields unbiased estimates of relative expression across cells [@problem_id:4377531].

An alternative family of methods employs **gene-specific normalization**. These approaches relax the strong assumption of proportional sampling and explicitly model the fact that technical effects can vary by gene, due to factors like gene length, GC content, or non-linearities in amplification. Instead of a single factor $s_i$, these methods model the expected count as $\mathbb{E}[c_{gi}] = f_g(s_i) \theta_{gi}$, where $f_g$ is a gene-specific function describing how its detection depends on technical factors. Normalization then involves estimating and regressing out the contribution of $f_g(s_i)$ for each gene individually, for example, using [generalized linear models](@entry_id:171019). It is crucial to note that some normalization methods from other fields, like **[quantile normalization](@entry_id:267331)**, are generally inappropriate for scRNA-seq. Quantile normalization forces the entire distribution of counts to be identical across cells, which erases the true biological heterogeneity that is the primary object of study [@problem_id:4377531].

#### Diagnosing and Quantifying Batch Effects

Beyond [cell-to-cell variability](@entry_id:261841) in capture efficiency, a more pernicious form of technical variation arises from **[batch effects](@entry_id:265859)**. These are systematic, non-biological variations induced by processing cells at different times, with different reagent lots, on different sequencing instruments, or by different operators [@problem_id:4377538]. Batch effects can be a dominant source of variation in single-cell datasets, potentially obscuring or being mistaken for true biological differences.

Diagnosing batch effects is a crucial first step. A simple and powerful visual diagnostic is to perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the normalized data and color each cell in the resulting 2D plot by its batch label. If cells cluster by batch rather than by expected biological cell type, this is a strong indicator of a significant batch effect.

To quantify the magnitude of [batch effects](@entry_id:265859), one can leverage the properties of PCA and linear models. For each principal component (PC) $k$, its scores across the cells, $z_k$, can be treated as a continuous variable. By performing a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or an equivalent linear regression of $z_k$ against the categorical batch labels, one can compute the [coefficient of determination](@entry_id:168150), $R_k^2$. This value represents the proportion of variance in that specific PC that is statistically explained by the batch variable. To obtain a single summary statistic for the entire dataset, one can compute a weighted average of these $R_k^2$ values across the top PCs, where each $R_k^2$ is weighted by the variance of its corresponding PC (its eigenvalue, $\lambda_k$). This aggregated metric, $\frac{\sum_k R_k^2 \lambda_k}{\sum_k \lambda_k}$, provides a global measure of how much of the dominant variation in the data is aligned with batch [@problem_id:4377538].

These global, PCA-based metrics can be complemented by local diagnostics that assess how well cells from different batches are mixed in the high-dimensional space. Metrics like the **k-nearest neighbor Batch Effect Test (kBET)** and the **Local Inverse Simpson’s Index (LISI)** evaluate the batch composition in the local neighborhood of each cell. Poor mixing (e.g., a high kBET rejection rate or a low LISI score) indicates a strong local batch effect [@problem_id:4377538].

### Dimensionality Reduction: Discovering Latent Biological Structure

Even after normalization, a single-cell dataset is represented by a large matrix, with expression values for thousands of genes ($p$) across thousands of cells ($n$). However, the true biological complexity is often much lower; cells typically exist in states that can be described by a smaller number of underlying gene programs or "latent factors" ($k \ll p$). This means the data points lie on or near a low-dimensional **manifold** embedded within the high-dimensional gene space. Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for discovering and visualizing this latent structure.

#### The Linear Latent Variable Model

Many classical dimensionality reduction methods, including PCA, are implicitly or explicitly based on a **linear-Gaussian [latent variable model](@entry_id:637681)**. This model assumes that the observed high-dimensional expression vector for a cell, $\mathbf{x}_i$, is generated from a low-dimensional latent vector, $\mathbf{z}_i \in \mathbb{R}^k$, via a linear transformation plus noise [@problem_id:4377578]:
$$
\mathbf{x}_i = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \mathbf{W}\mathbf{z}_i + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i
$$
Here, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the mean expression vector, $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times k}$ is the **loading matrix** whose columns define the latent axes, $\mathbf{z}_i$ is the vector of latent factor scores for cell $i$ (often assumed to be standard normal, $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}_k)$), and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i$ is a noise term, typically assumed to be Gaussian, $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\epsilon})$. The goal of [dimensionality reduction](@entry_id:142982) is to infer the [latent variables](@entry_id:143771) $\mathbf{z}_i$ and/or the structure of the loading matrix $\mathbf{W}$, specifically its [column space](@entry_id:150809), which defines the latent subspace.

#### A Comparison of PCA, PPCA, and Factor Analysis

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is the most widely used [dimensionality reduction](@entry_id:142982) technique. It finds a set of orthogonal axes that successively maximize the variance in the data. These axes are the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. In the context of the linear [latent variable model](@entry_id:637681), PCA provides an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the true latent subspace (the column space of $\mathbf{W}$) under a critical assumption: the noise must be **isotropic**, meaning it is [independent and identically distributed](@entry_id:169067) across all genes with the same variance ($\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\epsilon} = \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}_p$) [@problem_id:4377578].

**Probabilistic PCA (PPCA)** is a probabilistic formulation of PCA that explicitly assumes the linear-Gaussian model with isotropic noise. It finds the maximum likelihood estimates for the model parameters. The solution for the latent subspace in PPCA is equivalent to that found by standard PCA.

The assumption of isotropic noise is often violated in [gene expression data](@entry_id:274164), where different genes can have substantially different levels of [measurement noise](@entry_id:275238) and biological variability. This scenario, where the noise is gene-specific, is called **heteroscedastic noise** ($\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\epsilon} = \boldsymbol{\Psi}$, where $\boldsymbol{\Psi}$ is a [diagonal matrix](@entry_id:637782) with unequal entries). Under heteroscedastic noise, PCA is no longer guaranteed to recover the true latent subspace. The principal components it finds will be a mixture of the true biological signal and the noise structure, biased toward axes with high-variance noise.

**Factor Analysis (FA)** is a more general model that is designed to handle this situation. FA explicitly models the noise as being heteroscedastic and diagonal, assuming a covariance structure of $\mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^T + \boldsymbol{\Psi}$. By allowing each gene to have its own unique noise variance, FA can correctly disentangle the shared covariance (from the latent factors) from the gene-specific noise. Therefore, FA provides a consistent, asymptotically unbiased estimate of the latent subspace even when the noise is heteroscedastic, making it a theoretically more appropriate choice than PCA for many biological datasets [@problem_id:4377578].

In practice, a common workflow is to apply a **[variance-stabilizing transformation](@entry_id:273381)** to the normalized data before performing PCA. Such transformations aim to make the variance more constant across the range of mean expression values, thereby making the data better conform to the homoscedastic noise assumption of PCA. It is also imperative that data are centered (mean-subtracted) before applying PCA; otherwise, the first principal component will typically be dominated by the mean expression vector rather than the primary axis of variation [@problem_id:4377578].

### Inferring Cellular Dynamics

While dimensionality reduction reveals the structure of cell states, it provides only a static view. A key goal of [single-cell systems biology](@entry_id:269071) is to understand the dynamic processes that move cells through these states, such as differentiation, reprogramming, or response to perturbation.

#### Pseudotime: Ordering Cells along Developmental Trajectories

When studying asynchronous processes like [cell differentiation](@entry_id:274891), a single snapshot of a cell population captures cells at various stages of the process. **Trajectory inference** algorithms aim to piece together these static states to reconstruct the underlying developmental progression. The output of such an algorithm is often a **pseudotime** value, $t_p$, assigned to each cell.

Pseudotime is a scalar ordering of cells along an inferred trajectory that is consistent with the developmental progression in gene expression space [@problem_id:4377595]. It is crucial to distinguish pseudotime from other temporal variables:
- **Chronological Time ($t_c$)**: This is the actual "wall-clock" time (e.g., in hours or days) over which a cell develops. Pseudotime is not equal to chronological time. The rate of biological change is generally not constant, so a cell might spend a long chronological time in one state (a small change in $t_p$) and then rapidly transition to another (a large change in $t_p$).
- **Cell Cycle Phase ($\phi$)**: This is a periodic variable representing a cell's position within the cell cycle (e.g., G1, S, G2/M). Since it is periodic, it cannot serve as a monotonic coordinate for a directed process like differentiation. A cell early in differentiation and a cell late in differentiation can both be in S phase, for example.

A key property of pseudotime is its **arbitrary reparameterization**. If $t_p$ is a valid ordering, then any strictly increasing function of $t_p$ (e.g., $t_p^2$ or $a \cdot t_p$) is also a valid pseudotime, as it preserves the order of the cells. This means that pseudotime values are unitless and their absolute scale is arbitrary. Consequently, pseudotime values are not directly comparable across different experiments without specialized alignment procedures [@problem_id:4377595].

#### RNA Velocity I: The Kinetic Model of Splicing

While [pseudotime](@entry_id:262363) provides an ordering, it does not provide directionality on its own (the start and end of the trajectory must be specified from prior knowledge) nor does it offer a mechanistic model of [cell state transitions](@entry_id:747193). **RNA velocity** is a powerful concept that addresses this by inferring the future state of individual cells based on the kinetics of mRNA splicing.

In eukaryotes, genes are first transcribed into [intron](@entry_id:152563)-containing **precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA)**, which is then spliced to form mature, protein-coding **mRNA**. Standard 3' scRNA-seq protocols can capture reads that map to both [exons and introns](@entry_id:261514). This allows for the separate quantification of **unspliced** pre-mRNA (from reads that overlap with [introns](@entry_id:144362)) and **spliced** mature mRNA (from reads that map exclusively to exons). Let us denote these molecular counts as $u$ and $s$, respectively [@problem_id:4377548].

The dynamics of these two species can be described by a simple kinetic model. Pre-mRNA ($u$) is transcribed at a rate $\alpha$ and is converted to mature mRNA ($s$) via splicing at a rate proportional to its own abundance, $\gamma u$. Mature mRNA ($s$) is in turn produced by splicing and is degraded at a rate proportional to its abundance, $\beta s$. This leads to a system of coupled [ordinary differential equations](@entry_id:147024):
$$
\frac{du}{dt} = \alpha - \gamma u
$$
$$
\frac{ds}{dt} = \gamma u - \beta s
$$
The term $\frac{ds}{dt}$ is defined as the **RNA velocity**. It represents the [instantaneous rate of change](@entry_id:141382) of the mature mRNA abundance. For a given gene in a single cell, if we can measure the current abundances of $u$ and $s$ and estimate the kinetic rates, we can calculate this velocity. A positive velocity ($v > 0$) indicates that the gene's expression is increasing, while a negative velocity ($v  0$) indicates it is decreasing. By combining the velocities of many genes, one can compute a high-dimensional velocity vector for each cell, predicting its future transcriptional state in the short term [@problem_id:4377548].

#### RNA Velocity II: Assumptions, Violations, and Diagnostics

The power of RNA velocity comes from the insight that the kinetic rates can be estimated directly from the data. The model predicts that when a gene's expression is at a steady state ($du/dt = 0$ and $ds/dt = 0$), the ratio of spliced to unspliced mRNA is constant: $s = (\gamma/\beta)u$. In a [phase plot](@entry_id:264603) of $s$ versus $u$, cells at steady state lie on a straight line. Cells that are actively being induced will have an excess of unspliced pre-mRNA, placing them above this line, while cells where the gene is being repressed will have a deficit, placing them below it. The deviation of a cell from this steady-state line is proportional to its RNA velocity.

The standard RNA velocity workflow relies on several strong assumptions, and their violation can lead to spurious results. Critical evaluation of these assumptions is essential.

**Biological Violations**:
- **Heterogeneous Kinetics**: The model assumes that the rates of transcription ($\alpha$), splicing ($\gamma$), and degradation ($\beta$) are constant for a gene across all cells. However, these rates can change with cell state. For example, transcription and degradation rates are often modulated during the **cell cycle**. This can be diagnosed by testing for a [statistical association](@entry_id:172897) between gene-wise velocity estimates and a cell's position in the cell cycle [@problem_id:4377574].
- **Splicing Heterogeneity**: The splicing rate $\gamma$ can vary due to mechanisms like [alternative splicing](@entry_id:142813) or regulated [intron](@entry_id:152563) retention, often controlled by **RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)**. This violation can be diagnosed by testing whether the unspliced-to-spliced ratio correlates with the expression of RBP modules across cells [@problem_id:4377574].

**Technical Violations**:
- **Ambient RNA**: Contamination from free-floating mRNA in the cell suspension (ambient RNA) disproportionately inflates the spliced counts ($s$), as mature mRNA is more abundant than pre-mRNA in lysed cells. This can systematically bias velocities towards negative values. A diagnostic involves estimating the contamination level from empty droplets and testing for a correlation between contamination fraction and velocity magnitude [@problem_id:4377574].
- **Sequencing and Alignment Artifacts**: In 3' sequencing protocols, **internal priming** at A-rich sequences within long introns can generate spurious reads that are misidentified as unspliced transcripts, inflating $u$. This can be diagnosed by directly analyzing the genomic locations of unspliced reads relative to A-rich motifs and testing for batch-specific differences or correlations with velocity estimates [@problem_id:4377574].

By understanding these principles, from the stochastic nature of a single transcript to the [complex dynamics](@entry_id:171192) of entire cell populations, we can more effectively and critically apply the tools of [single-cell systems biology](@entry_id:269071) to uncover the mechanisms of life.
