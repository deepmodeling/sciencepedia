Provide the exact closed-form expression for $q^{\\ast}$ as the final answer.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. The ODE represents a standard, deterministic model of mutation-selection balance, a fundamental concept in population genetics and evolutionary biology. The term $\\mu(1-q)$ correctly models the influx of new deleterious alleles from the wild-type population (frequency $1-q$), and the term $-sq$ correctly models the removal of the deleterious allele due to a selective disadvantage. The assumptions of large population size (justifying the deterministic ODE), constant parameters $\\mu$ and $s$, and negligible back mutation are standard simplifications to make the problem analytically tractable.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The governing equation is a first-order linear ODE with constant coefficients, which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a solution for any given initial condition $q(0)$. The tasks are specific and mathematically well-defined, leading to a unique analytical result.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative language. It is free of any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary parameters ($\\mu$, $s$) and the governing equation are provided. The constraints $\\mu  0$ and $s  0$ are physically meaningful and mathematically consistent. The state space for the frequency $q$ is the interval $[0, 1]$. The dynamics respect this space: if $q(t)=0$, $\\dot{q}(t) = \\mu  0$, and if $q(t)=1$, $\\dot{q}(t) = -s  0$, which means trajectories starting in $[0, 1]$ remain in $[0, 1]$. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the dynamics of the allele frequency $q(t)$ governed by the ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dt} = \\mu(1 - q) - sq\n$$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Frequency ($q^{\\ast}$)**\n\nThe equilibrium frequency, denoted as $q^{\\ast}$, is the value of $q$ for which the frequency does not change over time. This corresponds to the state where $\\frac{dq}{dt} = 0$. Setting the right-hand side of the ODE to zero, we get:\n$$\n\\mu(1 - q^{\\ast}) - sq^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nWe solve this linear equation for $q^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\mu - \\mu q^{\\ast} - sq^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = \\mu q^{\\ast} + sq^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = (\\mu + s)q^{\\ast}\n$$\nIsolating $q^{\\ast}$ yields the exact expression for the equilibrium frequency:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu + s}\n$$\nSince $\\mu  0$ and $s  0$, it is clear that $0  q^{\\ast}  1$, which is a physically realistic frequency.\n\n**2. Local Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the local stability of the equilibrium point $q^{\\ast}$, we examine the behavior of the system near this point. Let $f(q) = \\mu(1 - q) - sq$. The stability is determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(q)$ with respect to $q$, evaluated at $q=q^{\\ast}$.\n$$\nf'(q) = \\frac{d}{dq} \\left( \\mu - \\mu q - sq \\right) = -\\mu - s\n$$\nThe derivative is $f'(q) = -(\\mu + s)$. Since $\\mu  0$ and $s  0$, the sum $\\mu + s$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the derivative is strictly negative for all values of $q$:\n$$\nf'(q^{\\ast}) = -(\\mu + s)  0\n$$\nA negative sign for the derivative at the equilibrium point indicates that the equilibrium is locally stable. If the frequency $q$ is slightly perturbed from $q^{\\ast}$, it will return to $q^{\\ast}$. In fact, since $f'(q)$ is a negative constant, this is a globally stable equilibrium for any initial condition $q(0) \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Regime for Approximation**\n\nThe problem asks for the parameter regime under which the approximation $q^{\\ast} \\approx \\mu/s$ is valid. We start with the exact expression:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu + s}\n$$\nTo obtain the form $\\mu/s$, we can factor $s$ out of the denominator:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mu}{s\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{s}\\right)}\n$$\nFor the approximation $q^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{\\mu}{s}$ to hold, the denominator $s\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{s}\\right)$ must be close to $s$. This condition is met when the term $\\frac{\\mu}{s}$ is much smaller than $1$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu}{s} \\ll 1 \\implies \\mu \\ll s\n$$\nThus, the parameter regime for the validity of the approximation is when the mutation rate $\\mu$ is much smaller than the selection coefficient $s$. This is a very common scenario in biology, where mutation rates are typically very low (e.g., $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-5}$ per generation) while selection coefficients can be substantially larger.\n\n**4. Justification via Expansion**\n\nTo justify this approximation more formally, we perform an asymptotic expansion of the exact solution $q^{\\ast}$ in the limit $\\mu/s \\to 0$. Let the small dimensionless parameter be $\\epsilon = \\mu/s$. We can rewrite $q^{\\ast}$ as:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mu}{s(1 + \\mu/s)} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{s}\\right) \\frac{1}{1 + \\epsilon} = \\epsilon (1 + \\epsilon)^{-1}\n$$\nUsing the geometric series expansion for $(1 + \\epsilon)^{-1}$, which converges for $|\\epsilon|  1$:\n$$\n(1 + \\epsilon)^{-1} = 1 - \\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 - \\epsilon^3 + \\dots\n$$\nSubstituting this series back into the expression for $q^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} = \\epsilon \\left( 1 - \\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 - \\dots \\right) = \\epsilon - \\epsilon^2 + \\epsilon^3 - \\dots\n$$\nNow, substituting back $\\epsilon = \\mu/s$:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mu}{s} - \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{s}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{s}\\right)^3 - \\dots\n$$\nThe leading-order term of this expansion is $\\mu/s$. This is the approximation in question. The expansion explicitly shows that the error in this approximation is of the order of $(\\mu/s)^2$. For example, the first non-trivial order expansion is $q^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{\\mu}{s} - \\frac{\\mu^2}{s^2}$. When $\\mu \\ll s$, the first term dominates, and each successive term in the series becomes progressively smaller, justifying the truncation of the series to the leading-order term for a good approximation. This confirms that $q^{\\ast} \\approx \\mu/s$ is the correct leading-order approximation in the regime where selection is strong compared to mutation.\n\nThe final task is to provide the exact closed-form expression for $q^{\\ast}$, which was derived in the first step.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu+s}}\n$$", "id": "4339039"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems are complex networks where genes rarely act in isolation; their effects on fitness are often context-dependent.

This requires eliminating the other model parameters $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_A$, and $\\beta_B$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we directly obtain:\n$$ \\beta_0 = w_0 $$\nThis means $\\beta_0$ is the fitness of the baseline wild-type genotype.\n\nUsing this result in the second equation, we solve for $\\beta_A$:\n$$ w_A = \\beta_0 + \\beta_A \\implies \\beta_A = w_A - \\beta_0 = w_A - w_0 $$\nThe parameter $\\beta_A$ represents the fitness effect of the mutation at locus $A$ on the wild-type background.\n\nSimilarly, using the third equation, we solve for $\\beta_B$:\n$$ w_B = \\beta_0 + \\beta_B \\implies \\beta_B = w_B - \\beta_0 = w_B - w_0 $$\nThe parameter $\\beta_B$ represents the fitness effect of the mutation at locus $B$ on the wild-type background.\n\nFinally, we use the fourth equation and substitute the expressions for $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_A$, and $\\beta_B$:\n$$ w_{AB} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_A + \\beta_B + \\beta_{AB} $$\nSolving for $\\beta_{AB}$, which we call $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\beta_{AB} = w_{AB} - \\beta_0 - \\beta_A - \\beta_B $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived for the parameters in terms of the observed fitness values:\n$$ \\epsilon = w_{AB} - (w_0) - (w_A - w_0) - (w_B - w_0) $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ \\epsilon = w_{AB} - w_0 - w_A + w_0 - w_B + w_0 $$\n$$ \\epsilon = w_{AB} - w_A - w_B + w_0 $$\nThis is the desired expression for the interaction coefficient $\\epsilon$.\n\n(b) Numerical computation and interpretation.\n\nGiven the measured fitness values are $w_0 = 1.00$, $w_A = 1.10$, $w_B = 1.05$, and $w_{AB} = 1.20$.

If the two mutations had effects that were purely additive, the fitness of the double mutant, $w_{AB}^{add}$, would be the baseline fitness plus the sum of the individual effects of each mutation. The effect of mutation $A$ is $(w_A - w_0)$, and the effect of mutation $B$ is $(w_B - w_0)$. Thus, the expected additive fitness is:\n$$ w_{AB}^{add} = w_0 + (w_A - w_0) + (w_B - w_0) = w_A + w_B - w_0 $$\nThe interaction coefficient $\\epsilon$ is the difference between the observed fitness of the double mutant and this expected additive fitness:\n$$ \\epsilon = w_{AB} - (w_A + w_B - w_0) = w_{AB} - w_{AB}^{add} $$\nTherefore, $\\epsilon \\neq 0$ implies that the fitness effects of the mutations are not additive; there is epistasis between the loci. The fitness of the double mutant is not what would be predicted by simply combining the individual effects of the single mutations.\n\nThe sign of $\\epsilon$ indicates the nature of this interaction:\n-   $\\epsilon  0$: This is called **positive epistasis** (or synergistic epistasis). It means $w_{AB}  w_{AB}^{add}$. The combined fitness of the double mutant is greater than expected from the sum of individual effects. The two mutations work together more beneficially than expected. In this system, the expected additive fitness is $1.10 + 1.05 - 1.00 = 1.15$. The observed fitness is $1.20$, which is $0.05$ units higher, hence $\\epsilon = 0.05$.\n-   $\\epsilon  0$: This is called **negative epistasis** (or antagonistic epistasis). It means $w_{AB}  w_{AB}^{add}$. The combined fitness is less than expected, indicating the mutations interfere with each other or have redundant effects.\n-   $\\epsilon = 0$: This indicates no epistasis (additivity).

The total population size is $N(t) = N_1(t) + N_2(t)$. The frequency of the focal genotype is $p(t) = N_1(t) / N(t)$.\n\nUnder the Malthusian model, each genotype grows exponentially according to its Malthusian fitness parameter (growth rate). Let the fitness of the focal genotype be $r_1$ and the fitness of the reference genotype be $r_2$. The dynamics are given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1 N_1(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2 N_2(t)\n$$\nThe selection coefficient, $s$, is defined as the fitness advantage of the focal genotype, such that $s = r_1 - r_2$.\n\nTo find the dynamics of the frequency $p(t)$, we differentiate it with respect to time using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{N_1}{N_1 + N_2} \\right) = \\frac{\\frac{dN_1}{dt}(N_1 + N_2) - N_1\\left(\\frac{dN_1}{dt} + \\frac{dN_2}{dt}\\right)}{(N_1 + N_2)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the Malthusian growth equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{r_1 N_1 (N_1 + N_2) - N_1 (r_1 N_1 + r_2 N_2)}{(N_1 + N_2)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{r_1 N_1^2 + r_1 N_1 N_2 - r_1 N_1^2 - r_2 N_1 N_2}{(N_1 + N_2)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{(r_1 - r_2) N_1 N_2}{(N_1 + N_2)^2}\n$$\nBy substituting $s = r_1 - r_2$, $p = N_1/N$, and $1-p = N_2/N$, we arrive at the continuous-time replicator equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = s \\cdot p(t) \\cdot (1 - p(t))\n$$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{p(1-p)} = s \\, dt\n$$\nUsing partial fraction decomposition, $\\frac{1}{p(1-p)} = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{1-p}$.

The observed data are counts $k_t$ out of $n_t$ trials, which are binomially distributed, $k_t \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_t, p(t))$. The canonical link function for the binomial family is the logit link, $g(\\mu) = \\text{logit}(\\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is the mean of the response (here, $\\mu = p(t)$). The GLM models the transformed mean as a linear function of the predictors: $g(p(t)) = \\text{logit}(p(t)) = st + \\beta_0$. Thus, fitting such a GLM would yield an estimate for the slope, which directly corresponds to the selection coefficient $s$.\n\nThe problem permits a simplification: performing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) on the transformed empirical frequencies, $y_t = \\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_t) = \\ln(\\frac{\\hat{p}_t}{1-\\hat{p}_t})$, against time $t$. This approximates the GLM by assuming the variance of $y_t$ is constant, which is not strictly true (the variance of the logit-transformed frequency depends on $p(t)$ and $n_t$). However, under the problem's instruction to treat $\\hat{p}_t$ as \"noise-free estimates,\" this simplification is warranted.\n\nThe assumptions for the OLS slope estimator to be an unbiased estimator of $s$ are:\n1.  **Correct Model Specification**: The underlying dynamics must follow the replicator equation $\\frac{dp}{dt} = s p(1-p)$. This in turn relies on the following biological assumptions:\n    *   Asexual reproduction.\n    *   A large, well-mixed population where genetic drift is negligible.\n    *   Malthusian (continuous-time exponential) growth.\n    *   The selection coefficient $s$ is constant over time and independent of frequency.\n    *   No new mutations or back-mutations between the two genotypes.\n2.  **Linearity**: The relationship between the transformed variable $\\text{logit}(p(t))$ and time $t$ is linear, as derived.\n3.  **Noise-free Data (as per problem statement)**: The empirical frequencies $\\hat{p}_t$ are treated as exact measurements of the true frequencies $p(t)$. This is a very strong and unrealistic assumption that eliminates sampling noise as a source of error, thereby removing concerns about the bias introduced by the nonlinear logit transform (i.e., $E[\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_t)] \\neq \\text{logit}(E[\\hat{p}_t])$). Under this specific directive, the OLS procedure is applied to error-free data points that lie perfectly on the true trajectory, making the estimator unbiased by definition.\n4.  **No error in the independent variable**: Time $t$ is measured without error.\n\n### Step 4: Numerical Estimation of the Selection Coefficient\nFirst, we calculate the empirical frequencies $\\hat{p}_t = k_t/n_t$ and their logit transformations $y_t = \\ln(\\hat{p}_t / (1-\\hat{p}_t))$.\nThe data points $(t, k_t, n_t)$ are:\n- $t=0$: $\\hat{p}_0 = 100/1000 = 0.1$, $y_0 = \\ln(0.1/0.9) = \\ln(1/9) \\approx -2.19722$\n- $t=5$: $\\hat{p}_5 = 200/1000 = 0.2$, $y_5 = \\ln(0.2/0.8) = \\ln(1/4) \\approx -1.38629$\n- $t=10$: $\\hat{p}_{10} = 350/1000 = 0.35$, $y_{10} = \\ln(0.35/0.65) = \\ln(7/13) \\approx -0.61904$\n- $t=15$: $\\hat{p}_{15} = 550/1000 = 0.55$, $y_{15} = \\ln(0.55/0.45) = \\ln(11/9) \\approx 0.20067$\n- $t=20$: $\\hat{p}_{20} = 700/1000 = 0.7$, $y_{20} = \\ln(0.7/0.3) = \\ln(7/3) \\approx 0.84730$\n\nWe now perform a simple linear regression of $y$ on $t$. The estimate for the slope, $\\hat{s}$, is given by the OLS formula:\n$$\n\\hat{s} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (t_i - \\bar{t})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (t_i - \\bar{t})^2}\n$$\nThe time points are $t = \\{0, 5, 10, 15, 20\\}$.\nThe mean time is $\\bar{t} = (0+5+10+15+20)/5 = 10$.\nThe logit-transformed frequencies are $y \\approx \\{-2.19722, -1.38629, -0.61904, 0.20067, 0.84730\\}$.\nThe mean of the $y$ values is $\\bar{y} \\approx (-2.19722 - 1.38629 - 0.61904 + 0.20067 + 0.84730)/5 = -3.15458/5 \\approx -0.63092$.\n\nNumerator calculation: $\\sum (t_i - \\bar{t})(y_i - \\bar{y})$\n- $(0-10)(-2.19722 - (-0.63092)) = (-10)(-1.56630) = 15.6630$\n- $(5-10)(-1.38629 - (-0.63092)) = (-5)(-0.75537) = 3.77685$\n- $(10-10)(-0.61904 - (-0.63092)) = (0)(0.01188) = 0$\n- $(15-10)(0.20067 - (-0.63092)) = (5)(0.83159) = 4.15795$\n- $(20-10)(0.84730 - (-0.63092)) = (10)(1.47822) = 14.7822$\nSum of products = $15.6630 + 3.77685 + 0 + 4.15795 + 14.7822 = 38.3800$\n\nDenominator calculation: $\\sum (t_i - \\bar{t})^2$\n- $(0-10)^2 + (5-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (15-10)^2 + (20-10)^2$\n- $100 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 100 = 250$\n\nThe estimated selection coefficient is:\n$$\n\\hat{s} = \\frac{38.3800}{250} = 0.15352\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\hat{s} = 0.1535$.
