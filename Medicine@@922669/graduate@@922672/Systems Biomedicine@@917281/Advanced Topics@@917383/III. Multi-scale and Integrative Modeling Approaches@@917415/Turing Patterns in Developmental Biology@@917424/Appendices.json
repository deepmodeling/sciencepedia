Since $\\tau(k)$ is strictly decreasing in $k^2$ when $D_u+D_v>0$, if $\\tau(0) < 0$, then $\\tau(k) < 0$ for all $k>0$, and loss of stability can only occur via $\\Delta(k)$ becoming negative for some $k>0$. Writing\n$$\n\\Delta(k) \\;=\\; \\Delta_0 \\;-\\; m\\,k^2 \\;+\\; p\\,k^4,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\Delta_0 \\;=\\; f_u g_v - f_v g_u, \n\\qquad\nm \\;=\\; f_u D_v + g_v D_u, \n\\qquad\np \\;=\\; D_u D_v,\n$$\none sees that $\\Delta(k)$ is a quadratic in $k^2$ opening upward. For an interval of $k^2>0$ where $\\Delta(k)<0$ to exist, it is necessary that $\\Delta_0>0$, $m>0$, and the discriminant\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}} \\;=\\; m^2 \\;-\\; 4 p \\Delta_0\n$$\nbe strictly positive; the unstable band then lies between the positive roots $k^2_{\\pm} = \\dfrac{m \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}}}{2p}$. In addition, stability at $k=0$ requires\n$$\n\\tau(0) \\;=\\; f_u + g_v \\;<\\; 0, \n\\qquad \n\\Delta_0 \\;>\\; 0.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate these quantities for the given parameters $D_u=1$ and $D_v=16$. First, the $k=0$ criteria:\n$$\n\\tau(0) \\;=\\; f_u + g_v \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{7} - \\frac{49}{25} \\;=\\; \\frac{125 - 343}{175} \\;=\\; -\\frac{218}{175} \\;<\\; 0,\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_0 \\;=\\; f_u g_v - f_v g_u \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{7}\\left(-\\frac{49}{25}\\right) - \\frac{49}{25}\\left(-\\frac{12}{7}\\right) \\;=\\; -\\frac{245}{175} + \\frac{588}{175} \\;=\\; \\frac{343}{175} \\;=\\; \\frac{49}{25} \\;>\\; 0.\n$$\nThus, the homogeneous steady state is linearly stable in the absence of diffusion ($k=0$). Next, compute the coefficients governing the $k$-dependence:\n$$\nm \\;=\\; f_u D_v + g_v D_u \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{7}\\cdot 16 \\;+\\; \\left(-\\frac{49}{25}\\right)\\cdot 1 \\;=\\; \\frac{80}{7} - \\frac{49}{25} \\;=\\; \\frac{1657}{175} \\;>\\; 0,\n$$\n$$\np \\;=\\; D_u D_v \\;=\\; 1\\cdot 16 \\;=\\; 16.\n$$\nTherefore, the Turing discriminant is\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}} \\;=\\; m^2 - 4 p \\Delta_0 \n\\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1657}{175}\\right)^2 \\;-\\; 4\\cdot 16 \\cdot \\frac{49}{25}\n\\;=\\; \\frac{2{,}745{,}649}{30{,}625} \\;-\\; \\frac{3{,}841{,}600}{30{,}625}\n\\;=\\; -\\frac{1{,}095{,}951}{30{,}625}.\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}} \\;\\approx\\; -35.786155102\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures,\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}} \\;\\approx\\; -35.79.\n$$\n\nBecause $\\tau(0) < 0$ and $\\Delta_0 > 0$, the steady state is linearly stable at $k=0$.
