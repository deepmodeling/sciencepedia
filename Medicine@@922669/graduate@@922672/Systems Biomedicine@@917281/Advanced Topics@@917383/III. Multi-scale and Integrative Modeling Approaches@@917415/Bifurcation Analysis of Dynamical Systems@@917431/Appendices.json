Each reaction contributes a term to the rate of change of $x$, $\\dot{x} = \\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n1.  Basal synthesis, $\\varnothing \\to X$: The rate is constant, given by $\\mu$. This reaction produces $X$, so its contribution is $+\\mu$.\n2.  First-order degradation, $X \\to \\varnothing$: The rate is proportional to the concentration of the reactant, $ax$. This reaction consumes $X$, so its contribution is $-ax$.\n3.  Autocatalysis, $2X \\to 3X$: The net production is one molecule of $X$. The rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of $X$, $bx^2$. This reaction produces $X$, so its contribution is $+bx^2$.\n4.

The inducer level $\\mu$ is a non-negative control parameter.\n\nEquilibrium points, or steady states $x^*$, of the system are found by setting $\\dot{x} = 0$:\n$$\nf(x^*; \\mu) = \\mu - ax^* + bx^{*2} - cx^{*3} = 0\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the parameter $\\mu$ as a function of the equilibrium concentration $x^*$:\n$$\n\\mu(x^*) = ax^* - bx^{*2} + cx^{*3}\n$$\nThis cubic relationship defines the bifurcation diagram in the $(\\mu, x)$ plane.\n\nA saddle-node (or fold) bifurcation in a one-dimensional system occurs at a critical point $(x_c, \\mu_c)$ where an equilibrium point loses its stability. This happens when two equilibria, one stable and one unstable, merge and annihilate. The mathematical conditions for this are:\n1.  The point is an equilibrium: $f(x_c; \\mu_c) = 0$.\n2.  The linearization at the equilibrium has a zero eigenvalue: $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\Big|_{(x_c, \\mu_c)} = 0$.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $f(x; \\mu)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -a + 2bx - 3cx^2\n$$\nSetting this to zero gives a quadratic equation for the critical concentrations $x_c$ where bifurcations can occur:\n$$\n-a + 2bx_c - 3cx_c^2 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad 3cx_c^2 - 2bx_c + a = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the solutions for $x_c$:\n$$\nx_c = \\frac{-(-2b) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2b)^2 - 4(3c)(a)}}{2(3c)} = \\frac{2b \\pm \\sqrt{4b^2 - 12ac}}{6c} = \\frac{b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}}{3c}\n$$\nThe problem provides the condition $b^2  3ac$, which ensures that there are two distinct, real, and positive solutions for $x_c$.

These two critical concentrations correspond to the locations of the two folds in the S-shaped bifurcation curve.\n\nTo determine which of these corresponds to the bifurcation of the \"smaller positive equilibrium,\" we must analyze the stability of the equilibrium branches. An equilibrium is stable if $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  0$ and unstable if $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  0$. The expression $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -(3cx^2 - 2bx + a)$ is a downward-opening parabola with roots at $x_{c1}$ and $x_{c2}$.\n- For $x  x_{c1}$ or $x  x_{c2}$, we have $3cx^2 - 2bx + a  0$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  0$. These branches are stable.\n- For $x_{c1}  x  x_{c2}$, we have $3cx^2 - 2bx + a  0$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  0$. This branch is unstable.\n\nThe state-space can be divided into three branches of equilibria in the bistable region:\n- The lower stable branch (the \"smaller positive equilibrium\"), for $x \\in (0, x_{c1})$.\n- The middle unstable branch, for $x \\in (x_{c1}, x_{c2})$.\n- The upper stable branch, for $x \\in (x_{c2}, \\infty)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the bifurcation where the \"smaller positive equilibrium\" (the lowest stable branch) collides with its \"neighboring equilibrium\" (the middle unstable branch). This collision occurs precisely at the concentration $x_c = x_{c1}$. The corresponding critical inducer level, $\\mu_c$, is the value of $\\mu$ at this point.\nWe have an elegant way to calculate $\\mu_c$ by relating the two bifurcation conditions. From the second condition, $a = 2bx_c - 3cx_c^2$. Substituting this into the first condition, $\\mu_c = ax_c - bx_c^2 + cx_c^3$, gives:\n$$\n\\mu_c = (2bx_c - 3cx_c^2)x_c - bx_c^2 + cx_c^3 = 2bx_c^2 - 3cx_c^3 - bx_c^2 + cx_c^3 = bx_c^2 - 2cx_c^3\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_c = x_c^2 (b - 2cx_c)\n$$\nWe now substitute $x_c = x_{c1} = \\frac{b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}}{3c}$ into this expression.\nLet $S = \\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}$ for simplicity. Then $x_{c1} = \\frac{b - S}{3c}$.\n\nFirst, compute the term $(b - 2cx_{c1})$:\n$$\nb - 2cx_{c1} = b - 2c\\left(\\frac{b-S}{3c}\\right) = b - \\frac{2}{3}(b-S) = \\frac{1}{3}b + \\frac{2}{3}S = \\frac{1}{3}(b + 2S)\n$$\nNext, compute the term $x_{c1}^2$:\n$$\nx_{c1}^2 = \\left(\\frac{b-S}{3c}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2 - 2bS + S^2}{9c^2} = \\frac{b^2 - 2bS + (b^2 - 3ac)}{9c^2} = \\frac{2b^2 - 3ac - 2bS}{9c^2}\n$$\nNow, multiply these two results to find $\\mu_c$:\n$$\n\\mu_c = \\left(\\frac{2b^2 - 3ac - 2bS}{9c^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{b + 2S}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{27c^2} (2b^2 - 3ac - 2bS)(b + 2S)\n$$\nExpanding the product in the numerator:\n$$\n(2b^2 - 3ac - 2bS)(b + 2S) = (2b^2 - 3ac)b + (2b^2 - 3ac)2S - 2bS(b) - 2bS(2S)\n$$\n$$\n= 2b^3 - 3abc + 4b^2S - 6acS - 2b^2S - 4bS^2\n$$\n$$\n= 2b^3 - 3abc + 2b^2S - 6acS - 4b(b^2-3ac)\n$$\n$$\n= 2b^3 - 3abc + (2b^2 - 6ac)S - 4b^3 + 12abc\n$$\n$$\n= -2b^3 + 9abc + 2(b^2 - 3ac)S\n$$\nSubstituting $S = \\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}$ back:\n$$\n\\mu_c = \\frac{-2b^3 + 9abc + 2(b^2 - 3ac)\\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}}{27c^2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the critical inducer level at which the lower stable equilibrium and the middle unstable equilibrium annihilate in a saddle-node bifurcation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{9abc - 2b^3 + 2(b^2 - 3ac)\\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}}{27c^2}}$$", "id": "4318763"}, {"introduction": "From circadian rhythms to cell cycle control, oscillations are a hallmark of living systems, often emerging from complex feedback loops.

The eigenvector for $\\lambda_{2} = -i\\omega$ is its complex conjugate, $\\bar{q} = (1, -i)^T$.\n\nWe express the state vector $\\mathbf{x}$ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors: $\\mathbf{x} = zq + \\bar{z}\\bar{q}$.\nSubstituting for $q$ and $\\bar{q}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = z \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ i \\end{pmatrix} + \\bar{z} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -i \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} z+\\bar{z} \\\\ i(z-\\bar{z}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the coordinate transformation:\n$$\nx = z + \\bar{z}, \\quad y = i(z - \\bar{z})\n$$\nIn this new complex coordinate $z$, the dynamics should be simpler. The inverse transformation is $z = \\frac{1}{2}(x - iy)$ and $\\bar{z} = \\frac{1}{2}(x + iy)$.\n\nWe derive the equation for $\\dot{z}$:\n$$\n\\dot{z} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{x} - i\\dot{y})\n$$\nSubstituting the given ODEs:\n$$\n\\dot{x} - i\\dot{y} = (\\mu x + \\omega y + F(x,y)) - i(\\mu y - \\omega x + G(x,y))\n$$\nwhere $F$ and $G$ represent the cubic terms. Grouping the linear terms:\n$$\n(\\mu x + \\omega y) - i(\\mu y - \\omega x) = \\mu(x - iy) + i\\omega(x - iy) = (\\mu + i\\omega)(x - iy)\n$$\nSince $x - iy = 2z$, the linear part of $\\dot{z}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(\\mu + i\\omega)(2z) = (\\mu+i\\omega)z\n$$\nThe full equation for $\\dot{z}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{z} = (\\mu + i\\omega)z + \\frac{1}{2}(F(x,y) - iG(x,y))\n$$\nThe normal form for the Hopf bifurcation is $\\dot{w} = (\\mu+i\\omega)w + a |w|^2 w + \\text{h.o.t.}$. For a system without quadratic terms, the coefficient $a$ is determined by the cubic terms in the original equation. Specifically, $a$ is the coefficient of the $z^2\\bar{z}$ term in the expansion of $\\frac{1}{2}(F-iG)$. Let's find this coefficient.\n$F - iG = (c_1 - id_1)x^3 + (c_2 - id_2)x^2y + (c_3 - id_3)xy^2 + (c_4 - id_4)y^3$.\nWe need to express the monomials $x^j y^k$ in terms of $z$ and $\\bar{z}$:\n$x^3 = (z+\\bar{z})^3 = z^3 + 3z^2\\bar{z} + 3z\\bar{z}^2 + \\bar{z}^3$\n$x^2y = (z+\\bar{z})^2 i(z-\\bar{z}) = i(z^2+2z\\bar{z}+\\bar{z}^2)(z-\\bar{z}) = i(z^3 + z^2\\bar{z} - z\\bar{z}^2 - \\bar{z}^3)$\n$xy^2 = (z+\\bar{z}) (i(z-\\bar{z}))^2 = -(z+\\bar{z})(z-\\bar{z})^2 = -(z^3 - z^2\\bar{z} - z\\bar{z}^2 + \\bar{z}^3)$\n$y^3 = (i(z-\\bar{z}))^3 = -i(z-\\bar{z})^3 = -i(z^3 - 3z^2\\bar{z} + 3z\\bar{z}^2 - \\bar{z}^3)$\n\nThe coefficient of the term $z^2\\bar{z}$ in $F-iG$ is the sum of contributions from each term:\n- From $(c_1-id_1)x^3$: $3(c_1-id_1)$\n- From $(c_2-id_2)x^2y$: $i(c_2-id_2)$\n- From $(c_3-id_3)xy^2$: $(-1)(-1)(c_3-id_3) = (c_3-id_3)$\n- From $(c_4-id_4)y^3$: $(-i)(-3)(c_4-id_4) = 3i(c_4-id_4)$\n\nLet $K_{21}$ be the total coefficient of $z^2\\bar{z}$ in $F-iG$.\n$$\nK_{21} = 3(c_1-id_1) + i(c_2-id_2) + (c_3-id_3) + 3i(c_4-id_4)\n$$\nThe coefficient $a$ in the normal form is $\\frac{1}{2}K_{21}$, because the nonlinear part of the $\\dot{z}$ equation is $\\frac{1}{2}(F-iG)$.\n$$\na = \\frac{1}{2} K_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} [ (3c_1 + d_2 + c_3 + 3d_4) + i(-3d_1 + c_2 -d_3 + 3c_4) ]\n$$\nThe first Lyapunov coefficient $l_1$ is related to the real part of $a$. The normal form in complex coordinates governs the dynamics of $z$. Let's write $z = \\rho e^{i\\phi}$.\n$\\dot{z} = (\\dot{\\rho} + i\\rho\\dot{\\phi})e^{i\\phi}$. At $\\mu=0$, the normal form is $\\dot{z} = i\\omega z + a|z|^2 z$.\n$(\\dot{\\rho} + i\\rho\\dot{\\phi})e^{i\\phi} = i\\omega \\rho e^{i\\phi} + a \\rho^3 e^{i\\phi}$.\n$\\dot{\\rho} + i\\rho\\dot{\\phi} = i\\omega \\rho + a\\rho^3 = i\\omega\\rho + (\\text{Re}(a) + i\\text{Im}(a))\\rho^3$.\nEquating the real parts gives the amplitude equation for $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho} = \\text{Re}(a) \\rho^3\n$$\nIncluding the bifurcation parameter $\\mu$, the equation is $\\dot{\\rho} = \\mu\\rho + \\text{Re}(a)\\rho^3$.\nNow we relate $\\rho$ to the original radial coordinate $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n$x = z+\\bar{z} = 2\\text{Re}(z)$ and $y = i(z-\\bar{z}) = -2\\text{Im}(z)$.\n$r^2 = x^2+y^2 = (2\\text{Re}(z))^2 + (-2\\text{Im}(z))^2 = 4(\\text{Re}(z)^2 + \\text{Im}(z)^2) = 4|z|^2 = 4\\rho^2$.\nSo, $r = 2\\rho$. Differentiating with respect to time gives $\\dot{r} = 2\\dot{\\rho}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\dot{\\rho}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{r}}{2} = \\mu \\frac{r}{2} + \\text{Re}(a) \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^3 = \\mu \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{\\text{Re}(a)}{8} r^3\n$$\nMultiplying by $2$:\n$$\n\\dot{r} = \\mu r + \\frac{\\text{Re}(a)}{4} r^3\n$$\nThe standard form of the amplitude equation for a Hopf bifurcation is $\\dot{r} = \\mu r + l_1 r^3$.
