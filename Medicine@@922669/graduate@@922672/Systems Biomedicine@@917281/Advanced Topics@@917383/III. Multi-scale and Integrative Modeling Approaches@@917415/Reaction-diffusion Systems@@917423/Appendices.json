It asks for a standard mathematical derivation based on provided information.\n\nThe starting point is the governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the concentration field $u(x,t)$ of a signaling molecule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^{2} u + k\\, u\n$$\nThis equation is a mathematical expression of the conservation of mass. The term $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ represents the local rate of change of concentration. The term $D \\nabla^{2} u$ represents the net change in concentration due to diffusion, derived from Fick's first law ($\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla u$). The term $k u$ represents the net rate of production or consumption of the molecule due to local reactions (positive $k$ for production, negative for consumption).\n\nTo nondimensionalize this equation, we introduce the rescaled, dimensionless variables as defined in the problem statement:\n- Dimensionless space: $\\tilde{x} = \\frac{x}{L}$\n- Dimensionless time: $\\tilde{t} = \\frac{t D}{L^{2}}$\n- Dimensionless concentration: $\\tilde{u} = \\frac{u}{U}$\n\nHere, $L$ is the characteristic length scale of the domain, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $U$ is an arbitrary constant with units of concentration. Our goal is to rewrite the PDE entirely in terms of $\\tilde{x}$, $\\tilde{t}$, and $\\tilde{u}$. To do this, we must transform the derivatives using the chain rule. First, we express the original variables in terms of the new dimensionless ones:\n$$\nx = L \\tilde{x}\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{L^{2}}{D} \\tilde{t}\n$$\n$$\nu = U \\tilde{u}\n$$\n\nNext, we transform each term in the PDE.\n\n1.  The time derivative term, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$:\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (U \\tilde{u})}{\\partial t} = U \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial t} = U \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nFrom the definition $\\tilde{t} = \\frac{t D}{L^{2}}$, we find the derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{D}{L^{2}}$.

Thus, the gradient operator transforms as:\n$$\n\\nabla = \\frac{1}{L} \\tilde{\\nabla}\n$$\nThe Laplacian operator is the divergence of the gradient, $\\nabla^{2} = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla$. So, its transformation is:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\tilde{\\nabla}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\tilde{\\nabla}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^{2}} \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2}\n$$\nNow, we can transform the term $\\nabla^{2} u$:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} u = \\nabla^{2} (U \\tilde{u}) = U (\\nabla^{2} \\tilde{u}) = U \\left(\\frac{1}{L^{2}} \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{u}\\right) = \\frac{U}{L^{2}} \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{u}\n$$\nThe full diffusion term is therefore:\n$$\nD \\nabla^{2} u = D \\left(\\frac{U}{L^{2}} \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{u}\\right)\n$$\n\n3.  The reaction term, $k u$:\nThis term is transformed by direct substitution:\n$$\nk u = k (U \\tilde{u})\n$$\n\nNow we substitute these transformed terms back into the original PDE:\n$$\nU \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} \\left(\\frac{D}{L^{2}}\\right) = D \\left(\\frac{U}{L^{2}} \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{u}\\right) + k (U \\tilde{u})\n$$\nThe arbitrary concentration scale $U$ appears in every term. Since $U$ is a positive constant, we can divide the entire equation by it:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\frac{D}{L^{2}} \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{u} + k \\tilde{u}\n$$\nThe conventional form of the dimensionless equation is obtained by making the coefficient of either the time derivative or the diffusion term equal to $1$. The choice of time scaling $\\tilde{t} = \\frac{tD}{L^2}$ was specifically made to simplify the diffusion term. To achieve this canonical form, we divide the entire equation by the factor $\\frac{D}{L^{2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{u} + \\frac{k}{\\left(\\frac{D}{L^{2}}\\right)} \\tilde{u}\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficient of the reaction term gives the final dimensionless PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2} \\tilde{u} + \\left(\\frac{k L^{2}}{D}\\right) \\tilde{u}\n$$\nThe equation is now expressed purely in terms of dimensionless variables and a single dimensionless group that multiplies the reaction term.

Stability of the homogeneous system ($k=0$): The roots of $\\lambda^2 - \\tau\\lambda + \\Delta = 0$ must have negative real parts. This requires $\\tau  0$ and $\\Delta  0$. We found $\\Delta = (a+b)^2$, which is always positive for $a,b0$. Thus, stability requires $\\tau = \\frac{b-a}{a+b} - (a+b)^2  0$.\n2.  Instability for $k0$: An instability arises if $\\text{Re}(\\lambda(k))  0$. The roots of the dispersion relation are $\\lambda(k) = \\frac{1}{2}(T(k) \\pm \\sqrt{T(k)^2 - 4\\Delta(k)})$. Instability can be initiated if $\\Delta(k)$ becomes negative. This is because if $\\Delta(k)  0$, the square root term is real and $\\sqrt{T(k)^2 - 4\\Delta(k)}  |T(k)|$. Since the Turing mechanism also requires $\\tau  0$ and $d_u, d_v  0$, we have $T(k) = \\tau - (d_u+d_v)k^2  0$. Then the larger root $\\lambda_+$ becomes positive: $\\lambda_+ = \\frac{1}{2}(T(k) + \\sqrt{T(k)^2 - 4\\Delta(k)})  0$.\n\nThe onset of instability corresponds to the minimum of $\\Delta(k)$ touching zero. We find this minimum by treating $\\Delta(k)$ as a quadratic function of $q=k^2$: $\\Delta(q) = d_u d_v q^2 - Pq + \\Delta$. The minimum occurs at $q = -(-P)/(2d_u d_v) = P/(2d_u d_v)$. This corresponds to the critical wavenumber squared, $k_c^2$. For a real wavenumber to exist, we must have $P0$.\nThus, the critical wavenumber is the one that minimizes $\\Delta(k)$:\n$$ k_c^2 = \\frac{P}{2d_u d_v} = \\frac{1}{2d_u d_v} \\left(d_v\\frac{b-a}{a+b} - d_u(a+b)^2\\right) $$\nThe critical wavenumber itself is:\n$$ k_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{P}{2d_u d_v}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2d_u d_v} \\left(d_v\\frac{b-a}{a+b} - d_u(a+b)^2\\right)} $$\nThe condition for the onset of instability is $\\min_k \\Delta(k) = 0$, which requires $P^2 = 4d_u d_v \\Delta$.\n\nThe problem has been solved systematically.
