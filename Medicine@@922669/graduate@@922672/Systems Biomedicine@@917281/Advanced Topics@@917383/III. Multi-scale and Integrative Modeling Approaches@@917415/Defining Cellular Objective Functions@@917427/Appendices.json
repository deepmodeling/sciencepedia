Consider a prokaryotic cell modeled with a biomass pseudo-metabolite whose molecular weight is set to $1$ g per mmol of biomass pseudo-metabolite. Thus, producing $1$ mmol of biomass corresponds to forming $1$ g of dry biomass. The macromolecular mass fractions of this biomass are: protein $= 0.55$, ribonucleic acid (RNA) $= 0.20$, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) $= 0.03$. Neglect the contributions of other biomass components to polymerization energy. Assume that the average incorporated monomer masses (that is, average residue mass in the polymerized state) are $110$ g mol$^{-1}$ for amino acids in protein, $330$ g mol$^{-1}$ for ribonucleotides in RNA, and $330$ g mol$^{-1}$ for deoxyribonucleotides in DNA. Assume that the energetic costs of polymerization, expressed in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) equivalents hydrolyzed per phosphodiester or peptide bond formed, are: protein translation cost $= 4$ ATP equivalents per peptide bond (accounting for aminoacyl-transfer RNA charging and guanosine triphosphate usage recharged from ATP), RNA transcription cost $= 1$ ATP equivalent per phosphodiester bond, and DNA replication cost $= 1$ ATP equivalent per phosphodiester bond. Assume long polymers so that the number of bonds approximately equals the number of incorporated monomers (ignore initiation and termination overheads and end-group corrections).

The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires solving a sequence of optimization problems. We can simplify the system by expressing all constraints in terms of the independent fluxes $v_{\\text{R}}$ and $v_{\\text{F}}$.\n\nThe given constraints are:\n1. $v_{\\text{in}} = v_{\\text{R}} + v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 60$\n2. $v_{\\text{O}_2} = 6\\,v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 6 \\implies v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 1$\n3. $0.8\\,v_{\\text{R}} + 0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 1$\n4. $v_{\\text{R}} \\geq 0$, $v_{\\text{F}} \\geq 0$\n\nNote that the first constraint, $v_{\\text{R}} + v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 60$, is redundant. From constraint $3$, $0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 1 - 0.8\\,v_{\\text{R}}$. Since $v_{\\text{R}} \\geq 0$, the right-hand side is at most $1$, so $0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 1$, which implies $v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 50$. Combined with $v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 1$, we have $v_{\\text{R}} + v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 1 + 50 = 51$, which is less than $60$. Thus, the feasible region for $(v_{\\text{R}}, v_{\\text{F}})$ is defined by $v_{\\text{R}} \\geq 0$, $v_{\\text{F}} \\geq 0$, $v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 1$, and $0.8\\,v_{\\text{R}} + 0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 1$.\n\n**Part 1: Maximizing Absolute ATP Production Rate ($v_{\\text{ATP}}^{\\max}$)**\nWe must maximize the objective function $v_{\\text{ATP}} = 30\\,v_{\\text{R}} + 2\\,v_{\\text{F}}$ over the feasible region. As this is a linear program, the maximum will occur at a vertex of the feasible region. The vertices of the region defined by $v_{\\text{R}} \\geq 0$, $v_{\\text{F}} \\geq 0$, $v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 1$, and $0.8\\,v_{\\text{R}} + 0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} \\leq 1$ are:\n- Intersection of $v_{\\text{R}}=0$ and $v_{\\text{F}}=0$: $(0, 0)$.\n- Intersection of $v_{\\text{F}}=0$ and $v_{\\text{R}}=1$: $(1, 0)$. This satisfies $0.8(1) + 0.02(0) = 0.8 \\leq 1$.\n- Intersection of $v_{\\text{R}}=0$ and $0.8\\,v_{\\text{R}} + 0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} = 1$: This gives $0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} = 1$, so $v_{\\text{F}}=50$. The vertex is $(0, 50)$. This satisfies $v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 1$.\n- Intersection of $v_{\\text{R}}=1$ and $0.8\\,v_{\\text{R}} + 0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} = 1$: This gives $0.8(1) + 0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} = 1$, so $0.02\\,v_{\\text{F}} = 0.2$, which means $v_{\\text{F}}=10$. The vertex is $(1, 10)$.\n\nWe evaluate $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ at each vertex:\n- At $(0, 0)$: $v_{\\text{ATP}} = 30(0) + 2(0) = 0$.\n- At $(1, 0)$: $v_{\\text{ATP}} = 30(1) + 2(0) = 30$.\n- At $(0, 50)$: $v_{\\text{ATP}} = 30(0) + 2(50) = 100$.\n- At $(1, 10)$: $v_{\\text{ATP}} = 30(1) + 2(10) = 30 + 20 = 50$.\n\nThe maximum value is $100$. Therefore, $v_{\\text{ATP}}^{\\max} = 100$.\n\n**Part 2: Maximizing ATP Yield per Substrate ($Y_{\\text{ATP/S}}$)**\nNext, we maximize the yield function $Y_{\\text{ATP/S}} = \\dfrac{30\\,v_{\\text{R}} + 2\\,v_{\\text{F}}}{v_{\\text{in}}}$. Substituting $v_{\\text{in}} = v_{\\text{R}} + v_{\\text{F}}$, we get:\n$$Y_{\\text{ATP/S}} = \\frac{30\\,v_{\\text{R}} + 2\\,v_{\\text{F}}}{v_{\\text{R}} + v_{\\text{F}}}$$\nThis function represents a weighted average of the individual yields, $30$ and $2$. Let $x = \\frac{v_{\\text{R}}}{v_{\\text{R}} + v_{\\text{F}}}$ be the fraction of substrate directed to respiration. Then $Y_{\\text{ATP/S}} = 30x + 2(1-x) = 28x + 2$. To maximize $Y_{\\text{ATP/S}}$, we must maximize $x$. This corresponds to maximizing the ratio of respiratory flux to total flux, which is achieved by making the flux purely respiratory ($v_{\\text{F}}=0$).\nWe must check if a purely respiratory flux ($v_{\\text{F}}=0$ and $v_{\\text{R}}>0$) is feasible. The constraints become $0 < v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 1$ and $0.8\\,v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 1$ (i.e., $v_{\\text{R}} \\leq 1.25$). A feasible solution exists for any $v_{\\text{R}} \\in (0, 1]$.\nFor any a such point with $v_{\\text{F}}=0$, the yield is $Y_{\\text{ATP/S}} = \\frac{30\\,v_{\\text{R}}}{v_{\\text{R}}} = 30$.\nThus, the maximal feasible value of the yield is $30$, and the \"yield-optimal composition\" is any state with $v_{\\text{F}}=0$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculating $v_{\\text{ATP}}^{\\text{yield}}$**\nWe now find the maximum ATP production rate subject to the constraint that enforces the yield-optimal composition, which is $v_{\\text{F}}=0$.

The metabolic network, while simple, is a valid representation for pedagogical purposes. Both optimization problems—maximizing biomass and minimizing total flux—are standard, biologically relevant objectives in metabolic modeling. The problem is well-posed; each part constitutes a linear programming problem with a convex feasible set defined by linear equalities and inequalities, ensuring a solution exists. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary stoichiometric relations and constraints. There are no contradictions in the provided data. The constraints are physically and mathematically consistent. For instance, the system of equations is solvable and the bounds are non-conflicting. The problem is expressed with objective and precise mathematical language. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins by simplifying the system using the steady-state mass balance equations. The equalities provide direct relationships between certain fluxes:\nFrom $v_{1} - v_{2} = 0$, we have $v_{1} = v_{2}$.\nFrom $v_{3} - v_{4} = 0$, we have $v_{3} = v_{4}$.\nThe balance on metabolite $A$, $2 v_{2} - v_{3} - v_{5} = 0$, can be rewritten as $v_{5} = 2v_{2} - v_{3}$.\nAll fluxes must be non-negative ($v_i \\ge 0$), which implies $v_{5} \\ge 0$, so we must satisfy the condition $2v_{2} - v_{3} \\ge 0$.\n\n**Part 1: Growth maximization with constitutive uptake**\n\nThe objective is to maximize the biomass synthesis flux, $v_{4}$. The problem specifies that the uptake flux is fixed at its maximum capacity, $v_{1} = 10$.\n\nThe solution is determined as follows:\n1.  The constraint $v_{1} = 10$ is applied. From the steady-state balance on $G$, $v_{1} = v_{2}$, so we have $v_{2} = 10$.\n2.  The objective is to maximize $v_{4}$. From the steady-state balance on $B$, $v_{3} = v_{4}$, so maximizing $v_{4}$ is equivalent to maximizing $v_{3}$.\n3.  The flux $v_{3}$ is subject to two constraints: the explicit capacity constraint $0 \\le v_{3} \\le 15$, and the implicit non-negativity constraint on $v_{5}$. The flux $v_5$ is given by $v_5 = 2v_2 - v_3$. Substituting $v_2 = 10$, we get $v_5 = 2(10) - v_3 = 20 - v_3$. The constraint $v_5 \\ge 0$ implies $20 - v_3 \\ge 0$, or $v_3 \\le 20$.\n4.  To maximize $v_{3}$, we must satisfy both $v_{3} \\le 15$ and $v_{3} \\le 20$. The more restrictive of these is $v_{3} \\le 15$. The maximum value for $v_{3}$ is therefore $15$.\n5.  With $v_{3} = 15$, the maximum biomass flux is $v_{4, \\text{max}} = v_{3} = 15$.\n6.  The remaining flux, $v_{5}$, is calculated as $v_{5} = 20 - v_{3} = 20 - 15 = 5$.\n\nThe resulting flux distribution for this objective, denoted by the superscript $(1)$, is:\n$v_{1}^{(1)} = 10$\n$v_{2}^{(1)} = 10$\n$v_{3}^{(1)} = 15$\n$v_{4}^{(1)} = 15$\n$v_{5}^{(1)} = 5$\nThe vector is $(10, 10, 15, 15, 5)$.\n\nThe biological meaning of this objective is to model a cell evolved for maximal growth rate in a nutrient-rich environment. The fixed uptake $v_{1}=10$ represents a \"greedy\" strategy where the nutrient uptake systems are fully expressed and active, consuming substrate at the maximum possible rate. The resulting non-zero excretion flux $v_{5} > 0$ signifies \"overflow metabolism,\" where the cell takes in substrate faster than its downstream pathways can process it into biomass, forcing it to excrete partially metabolized intermediates (metabolite A).\n\n**Part 2: Parsimonious flux usage at fixed growth**\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total flux, $\\|v\\|_{1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} v_{i}$, while achieving the maximal growth rate determined in Part 1. Thus, we have a new constraint: $v_{4} = v_{4, \\text{max}} = 15$. The uptake flux $v_{1}$ is no longer fixed at $10$ but is allowed to vary within its capacity, $0 \\le v_{1} \\le 10$.\n\nThe solution is determined as follows:\n1.  The constraint $v_{4} = 15$ is applied. From the steady-state balance on $B$, $v_{3} = v_{4}$, so we have $v_{3} = 15$. This satisfies the capacity constraint $0 \\le v_{3} \\le 15$.\n2.  The relationship $v_1 = v_2$ still holds. The boundary constraint $0 \\le v_{1} \\le 10$ implies $0 \\le v_{2} \\le 10$.\n3.  The non-negativity of $v_{5}$ imposes a constraint on $v_{2}$. We have $v_{5} = 2v_{2} - v_{3} = 2v_{2} - 15$. The condition $v_{5} \\ge 0$ implies $2v_{2} \\ge 15$, or $v_{2} \\ge 7.5$.\n4.  Combining the constraints on $v_2$, we find that its feasible range is $7.5 \\le v_{2} \\le 10$.\n5.  The objective function is the total flux $Z = v_{1} + v_{2} + v_{3} + v_{4} + v_{5}$. We express this in terms of the single variable $v_{2}$:\n    $Z(v_{2}) = v_{2} + v_{2} + 15 + 15 + (2v_{2} - 15) = 4v_{2} + 15$.\n6.  To minimize this linear function $Z(v_2)$ over the interval $[7.5, 10]$, we must choose the smallest possible value for $v_{2}$, which is $v_2 = 7.5$.\n7.  With $v_2 = 7.5$, we calculate the other fluxes.\n    $v_{1} = v_{2} = 7.5$.\n    $v_{3} = 15$.\n    $v_{4} = 15$.\n    $v_{5} = 2v_{2} - 15 = 2(7.5) - 15 = 15 - 15 = 0$.\n\nThe resulting flux distribution for this objective, denoted by the superscript $(2)$, is:\n$v_{1}^{(2)} = 7.5$\n$v_{2}^{(2)} = 7.5$\n$v_{3}^{(2)} = 15$\n$v_{4}^{(2)} = 15$\n$v_{5}^{(2)} = 0$\nThe vector is $(7.5, 7.5, 15, 15, 0)$.\n\nThe biological meaning of this objective is to model a cell that has evolved for maximal efficiency. Minimizing the sum of fluxes is a proxy for minimizing the total enzymatic cost required to operate the metabolism, as higher fluxes generally require higher concentrations of the catalyzing enzymes. This \"parsimonious\" strategy achieves the same optimal growth rate as in Part 1 but with the minimal necessary investment in metabolic activity. This is achieved by precisely regulating the uptake flux ($v_{1}=7.5$ instead of $10$) to match the exact needs of the cell, thereby completely eliminating the wasteful overflow metabolism ($v_{5}=0$).\n\n**Calculation of the reduction in total flux, $\\Delta F$**\n\nFinally, we compute the difference between the total flux used in the two scenarios.\nTotal flux for Part 1:\n$\\|v^{(1)}\\|_{1} = v_{1}^{(1)} + v_{2}^{(1)} + v_{3}^{(1)} + v_{4}^{(1)} + v_{5}^{(1)} = 10 + 10 + 15 + 15 + 5 = 55$.\nTotal flux for Part 2:\n$\\|v^{(2)}\\|_{1} = v_{1}^{(2)} + v_{2}^{(2)} + v_{3}^{(2)} + v_{4}^{(2)} + v_{5}^{(2)} = 7.5 + 7.5 + 15 + 15 + 0 = 45$.\n\nThe reduction in total flux is:\n$\\Delta F = \\|v^{(1)}\\|_{1} - \\|v^{(2)}\\|_{1} = 55 - 45 = 10$.\nThe problem specifies the units for this value as $\\text{mmol}\\,\\text{gDW}^{-1}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$.\nThus, the reduction in total flux is $10\\,\\text{mmol}\\,\\text{gDW}^{-1}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "3910550"}]}
