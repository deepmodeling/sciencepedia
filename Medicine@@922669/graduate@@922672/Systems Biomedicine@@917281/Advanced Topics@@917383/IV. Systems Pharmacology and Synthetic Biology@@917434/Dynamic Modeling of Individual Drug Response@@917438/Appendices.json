[@problem_id:4336926]", "problem": "Consider an individual-level one-compartment pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model described by the following principles. The pharmacokinetic state variable is the amount in the central compartment, denoted by $A_{c}(t)$. Mass conservation gives a balance between input and elimination fluxes. The input is a controllable infusion rate $u(t)$, and elimination is proportional to concentration in the central compartment. The concentration is defined by the central compartment amount divided by the apparent volume of distribution $V$. Clearance $CL$ is defined as the hypothetical volume of plasma fully cleared of drug per unit time. The pharmacodynamic output $y(t)$ is a measured biomarker whose instantaneous level is an increasing saturable function of the pharmacokinetic concentration via a maximum effect model with baseline. All model variables and parameters are positive. The independent variable is time $t$.\n\nTasks:\n1) Using dimensional analysis grounded in mass conservation and the definitions of clearance and concentration, assign physical units to $A_{c}$, $CL$, $V$, $u$, and $y$. Express units in terms of milligram (mg) for mass, liter (L) for volume, hour (h) for time, and biomarker unit (B) for the measured output.\n2) Starting from the mass balance principle “rate of change of amount equals inflow minus outflow” and the definition of clearance “elimination rate equals clearance times concentration,” write the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $A_{c}(t)$ and specify an instantaneous-effect pharmacodynamic map for $y(t)$ using a maximum effect with baseline formulation with parameters $E_{0}$ (baseline effect), $E_{\\max}$ (maximum drug-induced effect), and $EC_{50}$ (half-maximal effective concentration).\n3) Construct a nondimensionalization that reduces the number of free parameters while preserving the model’s predictive structure as follows. Define a characteristic time scale from the pharmacokinetics and choose a concentration scaling equal to the half-maximal effective concentration.

It is based on canonical principles of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling. All necessary definitions and conditions are provided to derive a unique solution. Proceeding to solution.\n\nThe problem consists of four parts, which will be addressed sequentially.\n\n1) **Dimensional Analysis**\nThe physical units for the specified variables and parameters are determined using their definitions and the principle of dimensional homogeneity. The base units are given as milligram ($mg$) for mass, liter ($L$) for volume, hour ($h$) for time, and biomarker unit ($B$) for the output.\n\n- $A_{c}(t)$: The amount of drug in the central compartment. This is a mass. Its unit is $mg$.\n- $V$: The apparent volume of distribution. This is a volume. Its unit is $L$.\n- Concentration $C(t)$ is defined as $A_{c}(t)/V$. Its units are therefore $\\frac{mg}{L}$.\n- $CL$: Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared per unit time. Its unit is $\\frac{L}{h}$.\n- The elimination rate is given as the product of clearance and concentration, $CL \\times C(t)$. The units of this rate are $(\\frac{L}{h}) \\times (\\frac{mg}{L}) = \\frac{mg}{h}$, which correctly represents a mass flux (mass per unit time).\n- $u(t)$: The infusion rate is an input mass flux. Its unit is $\\frac{mg}{h}$.\n- $y(t)$: The measured biomarker output. Its unit is given as $B$.\n\nIn summary:\n- Unit of $A_{c}$: $mg$\n- Unit of $CL$: $\\frac{L}{h}$\n- Unit of $V$: $L$\n- Unit of $u$: $\\frac{mg}{h}$\n- Unit of $y$: $B$\n\n2) **Model Formulation**\nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) model for $A_{c}(t)$ is derived from the mass balance principle: \"rate of change of amount equals inflow minus outflow\".\n\n- Rate of change of amount: $\\frac{dA_{c}(t)}{dt}$.\n- Inflow rate: $u(t)$.\n- Outflow rate (elimination): $CL \\times C(t) = CL \\times \\frac{A_{c}(t)}{V}$.\n\nCombining these terms yields the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the pharmacokinetic state:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{c}(t)}{dt} = u(t) - \\frac{CL}{V} A_{c}(t)\n$$\nThe pharmacodynamic (PD) model for the output $y(t)$ is an instantaneous, saturable function of concentration $C(t)$ described by a maximum effect model with a baseline. The parameters are the baseline effect $E_{0}$, the maximum drug-induced effect $E_{\\max}$, and the half-maximal effective concentration $EC_{50}$. The standard formulation is:\n$$\ny(t) = E_{0} + \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot C(t)}{EC_{50} + C(t)}\n$$\nSince $C(t) = \\frac{A_{c}(t)}{V}$, this can also be expressed in terms of the amount $A_c(t)$:\n$$\ny(t) = E_{0} + \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot \\frac{A_{c}(t)}{V}}{EC_{50} + \\frac{A_{c}(t)}{V}} = E_{0} + \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot A_{c}(t)}{V \\cdot EC_{50} + A_{c}(t)}\n$$\n\n3) **Nondimensionalization**\nNext, we construct a nondimensional version of the model.\n\n- **Characteristic Time Scale:** In the PK ODE, the term $\\frac{CL}{V}$ has units of $\\frac{1}{h}$.

The characteristic magnitude of both $\\frac{dA_{c}}{dt}$ and $\\frac{CL}{V}A_c$ is $\\frac{A_{c,ref}}{\\tau} = \\frac{EC_{50} \\cdot V}{V/CL} = EC_{50} \\cdot CL$.

We define a dimensionless output $\\bar{y}$ by scaling the drug-induced effect:\n$$\n\\bar{y} = \\frac{y(t) - E_{0}}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{C(t)}{EC_{50} + C(t)}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $EC_{50}$:\n$$\n\\bar{y} = \\frac{C(t)/EC_{50}}{1 + C(t)/EC_{50}}\n$$\nSince $\\bar{A}_{c} = C/EC_{50}$, the dimensionless output map is:\n$$\n\\bar{y}(\\bar{t}) = \\frac{\\bar{A}_{c}(\\bar{t})}{1 + \\bar{A}_{c}(\\bar{t})}\n$$\n- **Independent Dimensionless Groups:** The original model has five parameters: $\\{V, CL, E_{0}, E_{\\max}, EC_{50}\\}$. The derived dimensionless PK model for $\\bar{A}_{c}$ is parameter-free. The dimensionless PD map for $\\bar{y}$ is also parameter-free. However, to recover the physical output $y(t)$ from the dimensionless state solution $\\bar{A}_{c}(\\bar{t})$, one must use the relationship $y(t) = E_{0} + E_{\\max} \\cdot \\bar{y}(\\bar{t}) = E_{0} + E_{\\max} \\frac{\\bar{A}_{c}(\\bar{t})}{1 + \\bar{A}_{c}(\\bar{t})}$. This final step depends on two original parameters, $E_{0}$ and $E_{\\max}$. Thus, two independent parameter groups survive the nondimensionalization.\n\n4) **Linearization and Eigenvalue**\nConsider a constant infusion $u(t) = u_{0}$ for $t \\ge 0$. The dimensionless input becomes a constant, $\\bar{u}(\\bar{t}) = \\bar{u}_{0} = \\frac{u_{0}}{EC_{50} \\cdot CL}$. The dimensionless ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{A}_{c}}{d\\bar{t}} = \\bar{u}_{0} - \\bar{A}_{c}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We are asked to linearize it about its steady state. Let $f(\\bar{A}_{c}) = \\bar{u}_{0} - \\bar{A}_{c}$. The steady state, $\\bar{A}_{c,ss}$, is found by setting the time derivative to zero:\n$$\nf(\\bar{A}_{c,ss}) = 0 \\implies \\bar{u}_{0} - \\bar{A}_{c,ss} = 0 \\implies \\bar{A}_{c,ss} = \\bar{u}_{0}\n$$\nThe linearization of the system $\\frac{d\\bar{A}_{c}}{d\\bar{t}} = f(\\bar{A}_{c})$ around $\\bar{A}_{c,ss}$ is given by $\\frac{d(\\delta\\bar{A}_{c})}{d\\bar{t}} = J \\cdot \\delta\\bar{A}_{c}$, where $\\delta\\bar{A}_{c} = \\bar{A}_{c} - \\bar{A}_{c,ss}$ and $J$ is the Jacobian matrix (a scalar in this one-dimensional case) evaluated at the steady state.\n$$\nJ = \\frac{df}{d\\bar{A}_{c}} \\bigg|_{\\bar{A}_{c} = \\bar{A}_{c,ss}}\n$$\nWe compute the derivative of $f$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\bar{A}_{c}} = \\frac{d}{d\\bar{A}_{c}}(\\bar{u}_{0} - \\bar{A}_{c}) = -1\n$$\nThe Jacobian is a constant, $J = -1$. The linearized dynamics are therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\delta\\bar{A}_{c})}{d\\bar{t}} = -1 \\cdot \\delta\\bar{A}_{c}\n$$\nThe eigenvalue of the linearized dynamics is the coefficient of the state deviation, which is the value of the Jacobian.\nThe unique nonzero eigenvalue is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-1}\n$$", "id": "4336926"}, {"introduction": "A predictive model is only as good as the data used to calibrate it, and not all data is equally informative.

It is a valid, well-posed, and standard problem in engineering and biomedical sciences.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Continuous-Discrete Kalman Filter\n\nThe continuous-time dynamics of the drug concentration $C(t)$ are described by the linear stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k\\,C(t) + u_{0} + w(t) $$\nwhere $w(t)$ is continuous-time white noise with $E[w(t)] = 0$ and $E[w(t)w(t')] = q \\delta(t-t')$.\n\nThe first step is to find the exact solution to this SDE over a time interval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$ of duration $\\Delta = t_k - t_{k-1}$. Let $x(t) = C(t)$. The formal solution is obtained using an integrating factor, $\\exp(kt)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(x(t)e^{kt}) = (u_0 + w(t))e^{kt} $$\nIntegrating from $t_{k-1}$ to $t_k$:\n$$ x(t_k)e^{kt_k} - x(t_{k-1})e^{kt_{k-1}} = \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} u_0 e^{k\\tau} d\\tau + \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{k\\tau} w(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nSolving for $x(t_k)$:\n$$ x(t_k) = x(t_{k-1})e^{-k(t_k - t_{k-1})} + u_0 \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{-k(t_k - \\tau)} d\\tau + \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{-k(t_k - \\tau)} w(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nLet $x_k \\equiv x(t_k)$. The deterministic integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{-k(t_k - \\tau)} d\\tau = \\left[ \\frac{1}{k}e^{-k(t_k - \\tau)} \\right]_{\\tau=t_{k-1}}^{\\tau=t_k} = \\frac{1}{k}(1 - e^{-k\\Delta}) $$\nThe stochastic integral term represents the discrete-time process noise, let's call it $w_{k-1}$:\n$$ w_{k-1} = \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{-k(t_k - \\tau)} w(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nSince $w(t)$ is a zero-mean process, the expectation of $w_{k-1}$ is zero. The variance of $w_{k-1}$, denoted $Q_d$, is:\n$$ Q_d = E[w_{k-1}^2] = E\\left[ \\left( \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{-k(t_k - \\tau)} w(\\tau) d\\tau \\right) \\left( \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{-k(t_k - \\sigma)} w(\\sigma) d\\sigma \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ Q_d = \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{-k(t_k - \\tau)} e^{-k(t_k - \\sigma)} E[w(\\tau)w(\\sigma)] d\\tau d\\sigma $$\nUsing $E[w(\\tau)w(\\sigma)] = q \\delta(\\tau - \\sigma)$:\n$$ Q_d = q \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} e^{-2k(t_k - \\tau)} d\\tau $$\nLet $s = t_k - \\tau$, so $ds = -d\\tau$. The integration limits change from $\\tau=t_{k-1} \\to s=\\Delta$ and $\\tau=t_k \\to s=0$.\n$$ Q_d = q \\int_{\\Delta}^{0} e^{-2ks} (-ds) = q \\int_{0}^{\\Delta} e^{-2ks} ds = q \\left[ \\frac{e^{-2ks}}{-2k} \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta} = \\frac{q}{2k}(1 - e^{-2k\\Delta}) $$\nThus, we have derived the discrete-time state-space model:\n- State equation: $x_k = F x_{k-1} + B_d u_0 + w_{k-1}$, with $w_{k-1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, Q_d)$\n- Measurement equation: $y_k = H x_k + v_k$, with $v_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, R)$\n\nThe discrete-time model parameters are:\n- Transition matrix: $F = e^{-k\\Delta}$\n- Input matrix: $B_d = \\frac{1-e^{-k\\Delta}}{k}$\n- Process noise variance: $Q_d = \\frac{q}{2k}(1 - e^{-2k\\Delta})$\n- Measurement matrix: $H = 1$\n\nNow, we derive the Kalman filter update equations from these linear-Gaussian models. Let the state estimate and its variance at step $k-1$ (posterior) be $m_{k-1}$ and $P_{k-1}$. The distribution is $p(x_{k-1}|y_{1:k-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{k-1}; m_{k-1}, P_{k-1})$.\n\n**Time Update (Prediction):**\nThe goal is to find the distribution of $x_k$ given measurements up to $y_{k-1}$, i.e., $p(x_k|y_{1:k-1})$. This is the prior distribution for step $k$.\nThe predicted mean $m_k^-$ is the expectation of $x_k$ conditioned on $y_{1:k-1}$:\n$$ m_k^- = E[x_k | y_{1:k-1}] = E[F x_{k-1} + B_d u_0 + w_{k-1} | y_{1:k-1}] $$\n$$ m_k^- = F E[x_{k-1} | y_{1:k-1}] + B_d u_0 + E[w_{k-1} | y_{1:k-1}] $$\nSince $w_{k-1}$ is independent of past measurements and states, $E[w_{k-1} | y_{1:k-1}] = E[w_{k-1}] = 0$. By definition, $E[x_{k-1} | y_{1:k-1}] = m_{k-1}$.\n$$ m_k^- = F m_{k-1} + B_d u_0 $$\nThe predicted variance $P_k^-$ is the variance of $x_k$ conditioned on $y_{1:k-1}$:\n$$ P_k^- = \\text{Var}(x_k | y_{1:k-1}) = E[(x_k - m_k^-)^2 | y_{1:k-1}] $$\n$$ x_k - m_k^- = (F x_{k-1} + B_d u_0 + w_{k-1}) - (F m_{k-1} + B_d u_0) = F(x_{k-1} - m_{k-1}) + w_{k-1} $$\n$$ P_k^- = E[(F(x_{k-1} - m_{k-1}) + w_{k-1})^2 | y_{1:k-1}] $$\n$$ P_k^- = E[F^2(x_{k-1} - m_{k-1})^2 + 2F(x_{k-1} - m_{k-1})w_{k-1} + w_{k-1}^2 | y_{1:k-1}] $$\nThe cross-term is zero due to independence.\n$$ P_k^- = F^2 E[(x_{k-1} - m_{k-1})^2 | y_{1:k-1}] + E[w_{k-1}^2 | y_{1:k-1}] = F^2 P_{k-1} + Q_d $$\n\n**Measurement Update (Correction):**\nThe goal is to find the posterior distribution $p(x_k|y_{1:k})$ using the new measurement $y_k$. By Bayes' rule:\n$$ p(x_k|y_{1:k}) \\propto p(y_k|x_k, y_{1:k-1}) p(x_k|y_{1:k-1}) $$\nThe prior is $p(x_k|y_{1:k-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_k; m_k^-, P_k^-)$. The likelihood is $p(y_k|x_k) = \\mathcal{N}(y_k; Hx_k, R)$. The posterior will also be Gaussian, $p(x_k|y_{1:k}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_k; m_k, P_k)$.\nThe un-normalized log-posterior is the sum of the log-prior and log-likelihood (ignoring constants):\n$$ \\ln p(x_k|y_{1:k}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(x_k - m_k^-)^2}{P_k^-} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(y_k - Hx_k)^2}{R} + \\text{const.} $$\nTo find the posterior mean and variance, we complete the square for $x_k$ in the exponent. The quadratic and linear terms in $x_k$ are:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x_k^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{P_k^-} + \\frac{H^2}{R}\\right) - 2x_k \\left(\\frac{m_k^-}{P_k^-} + \\frac{y_k H}{R}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe posterior variance $P_k$ is the inverse of the coefficient of $x_k^2/(-2)$, so:\n$$ \\frac{1}{P_k} = \\frac{1}{P_k^-} + \\frac{H^2}{R} = \\frac{R + P_k^- H^2}{P_k^- R} \\implies P_k = \\frac{P_k^- R}{R + P_k^- H^2} $$\nLet's define the Kalman Gain $K_k = \\frac{P_k^- H}{H^2 P_k^- + R}$. In this form, $P_k = (1 - K_k H) P_k^-$.\nThe posterior mean $m_k$ is related to the linear term:\n$$ \\frac{m_k}{P_k} = \\frac{m_k^-}{P_k^-} + \\frac{y_k H}{R} $$\n$$ m_k = P_k \\left(\\frac{m_k^-}{P_k^-} + \\frac{y_k H}{R}\\right) = \\frac{P_k^- R}{R + P_k^- H^2} \\left(\\frac{m_k^-}{P_k^-} + \\frac{y_k H}{R}\\right) $$\n$$ m_k = \\frac{R}{R + P_k^- H^2}m_k^- + \\frac{P_k^- H}{R + P_k^- H^2} y_k $$\n$$ m_k = \\left(1 - \\frac{P_k^- H^2}{R + P_k^- H^2}\\right)m_k^- + K_k y_k = m_k^- - K_k H m_k^- + K_k y_k $$\n$$ m_k = m_k^- + K_k(y_k - H m_k^-) $$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation\nThe required task is to compute the posterior mean $m_1$ and variance $P_1$ at time $t_1 = \\Delta$ given the prior at $t_0=0$ and the measurement $y_1$.\n\n**Step A: Calculate Model Parameters**\n- Elimination rate constant: $k = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}}{V} = \\frac{3\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}}{30\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- Input rate: $u_0 = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{h}}{30\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}$\n- Measurement interval: $\\Delta = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n\n**Step B: Calculate Discrete-Time Parameters**\n- Transition matrix: $F = \\exp(-k\\Delta) = \\exp(-0.1 \\times 0.5) = \\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.9512294$\n- Input term: $B_d u_0 = \\frac{1-F}{k} u_0 = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.05)}{0.1} \\times 1 \\approx 0.4877057\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n- Process noise variance: $Q_d = \\frac{q}{2k}(1 - \\exp(-2k\\Delta)) = \\frac{0.2}{2 \\times 0.1}(1 - \\exp(-0.1)) \\approx 0.0951626\\,(\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L})^2$\n- Measurement matrix: $H = 1$\n- Measurement noise variance: $R = 0.25\\,(\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L})^2$\n- Prior at $t_0$: $m_0 = 0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$, $P_0 = 4\\,(\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L})^2$\n\n**Step C: Time Update (Prediction for $t_1$)**\n- Predict the mean at $t_1$:\n$$ m_1^- = F m_0 + B_d u_0 = (0.9512294 \\times 0) + 0.4877057 = 0.4877057\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L} $$\n- Predict the variance at $t_1$:\n$$ P_1^- = F^2 P_0 + Q_d = (\\exp(-0.05))^2 \\times 4 + (1 - \\exp(-0.1)) $$\n$$ P_1^- = \\exp(-0.1) \\times 4 + (1 - \\exp(-0.1)) \\approx 0.9048374 \\times 4 + 0.0951626 $$\n$$ P_1^- \\approx 3.6193496 + 0.0951626 = 3.7145122\\,(\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L})^2 $$\n\n**Step D: Measurement Update (Correction at $t_1$)**\n- Measurement: $y_1 = 3.2\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n- Calculate Kalman Gain $K_1$:\n$$ K_1 = \\frac{P_1^- H}{H^2 P_1^- + R} = \\frac{P_1^-}{P_1^- + R} = \\frac{3.7145122}{3.7145122 + 0.25} = \\frac{3.7145122}{3.9645122} \\approx 0.9369408 $$\n- Update the mean to find the posterior $m_1$:\n$$ m_1 = m_1^- + K_1(y_1 - H m_1^-) = 0.4877057 + 0.9369408 \\times (3.2 - 1 \\times 0.4877057) $$\n$$ m_1 = 0.4877057 + 0.9369408 \\times 2.7122943 \\approx 0.4877057 + 2.5412495 = 3.0289552\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L} $$\n- Update the variance to find the posterior $P_1$:\n$$ P_1 = (1 - K_1 H) P_1^- = (1 - 0.9369408 \\times 1) \\times 3.7145122 $$\n$$ P_1 = 0.0630592 \\times 3.7145122 \\approx 0.2342574\\,(\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L})^2 $$\n\nRounding the final results to four significant figures:\n- Posterior mean concentration: $m_1 \\approx 3.029\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n- Posterior variance: $P_1 \\approx 0.2343\\,(\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L})^2$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 3.029 & 0.2343 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4336914"}]}
