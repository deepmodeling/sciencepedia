The occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of total target in the complex form, $\\theta = \\frac{[DR]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{total}}}$. The time evolution of occupancy is described by the differential equation derived from the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} [D] (1 - \\theta) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\theta $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We analyze the system in two phases.\n\n**Phase 1: Dosing ($0 \\le t \\le T$)**\nDuring this phase, the free drug concentration is constant, $[D] = C$. The ODE is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} C - (k_{\\mathrm{on}}C + k_{\\mathrm{off}})\\theta $$\nLet the observed rate constant be $k_{\\mathrm{obs}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}C + k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, and the equilibrium occupancy be $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}C}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}C + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}C}{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}}$.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm updates the latent factors for one dimension (e.g., drugs) while holding the other dimension (e.g., targets) fixed. The update for a single drug's latent vector, $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$, is found by minimizing the sum of squared errors over its observed interactions, plus an $\\ell_{2}$ regularization term.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{x}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} u & v \\end{pmatrix}$ be the latent vector for drug $1$ that we want to determine. The set of target indices for which interactions with drug $1$ are observed is $\\mathcal{O}_1 = \\{1, 2\\}$. The corresponding interaction values are $y_{11} = 1$ and $y_{12} = 0$.\n\nThe regularized least-squares objective function, $L(\\mathbf{x}_1)$, restricted to the observed entries for drug $1$ is:\n$$\nL(\\mathbf{x}_1) = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{O}_1} (y_{1j} - \\mathbf{x}_1 \\mathbf{t}_j^{\\top})^2 + \\lambda \\|\\mathbf{x}_1\\|_2^2\n$$\nIn the general case for updating a drug vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$, the solution to this minimization problem is given by the closed-form equation for the transpose of the row vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top} = \\left( \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_i}^{\\top} \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_i} + \\lambda \\mathbf{I} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_i}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y}_i^{(\\mathcal{O}_i)}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_i}$ is the matrix whose rows are the target vectors $\\mathbf{t}_j$ for $j \\in \\mathcal{O}_i$, $\\mathbf{y}_i^{(\\mathcal{O}_i)}$ is the column vector of observed interaction values $y_{ij}$ for $j \\in \\mathcal{O}_i$, $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix of appropriate size (here, $2 \\times 2$).\n\nFor our specific problem, we are updating $\\mathbf{x}_1$. The relevant parameters are:\n- The set of observed target indices for drug $1$: $\\mathcal{O}_1 = \\{1, 2\\}$.\n- The vector of observed values: $\\mathbf{y}_1^{(\\mathcal{O}_1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_{11} \\\\ y_{12} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The matrix of corresponding target latent vectors: $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{t}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{t}_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix, $\\mathbf{I}_2$.\n- The regularization parameter: $\\lambda = 0.1$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these into the closed-form solution. First, we compute the components of the equation.\nThe product $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe product $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y}_1^{(\\mathcal{O}_1)}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y}_1^{(\\mathcal{O}_1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow construct the term to be inverted, $(\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1} + \\lambda \\mathbf{I})$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1} + \\lambda \\mathbf{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + 0.1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1.1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix can be expressed with fractions as $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{11}{10} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{11}{10} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe inverse of this diagonal matrix is found by taking the reciprocal of each diagonal element:\n$$\n\\left( \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1} + \\lambda \\mathbf{I} \\right)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{11}{10} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{11}{10} \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{10}{11} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{10}{11} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $\\mathbf{x}_1^{\\top}$ by multiplying the inverse matrix by $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{O}_1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y}_1^{(\\mathcal{O}_1)}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_1^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{10}{11} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{10}{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\frac{10}{11} \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) \\\\ (0 \\cdot 1) + (\\frac{10}{11} \\cdot 0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{10}{11} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis result is the column vector $\\mathbf{x}_1^{\\top}$. The updated latent factor for drug $1$, $\\mathbf{x}_1$, is a row vector, which is the transpose of $\\mathbf{x}_1^{\\top}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\left( \\mathbf{x}_1^{\\top} \\right)^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{10}{11} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the updated latent factor for drug $1$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{10}{11} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{10}{11} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4375888"}]}
