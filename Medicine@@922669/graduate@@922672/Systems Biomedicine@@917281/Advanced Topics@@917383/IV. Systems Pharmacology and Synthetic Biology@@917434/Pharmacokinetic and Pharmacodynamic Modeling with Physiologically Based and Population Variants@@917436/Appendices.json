It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem describes a single-compartment model for drug disposition following an intravenous bolus injection. The central tenets are mass balance and first-order elimination kinetics.\n\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the central compartment at time $t$. The rate of change of the amount of drug in the body is given by the mass balance equation. Since the administration is an intravenous bolus, there is no input term for $t > 0$. The elimination process is first-order, meaning the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the amount of drug present. This is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k A(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, which has units of inverse time (e.g., $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n\nThe problem provides definitions for two primary pharmacokinetic parameters: the apparent volume of distribution, $V$, and the systemic clearance, $CL$.\n\nThe apparent volume of distribution, $V$, relates the amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, to the measured plasma concentration, $C(t)$:\n$$\nV = \\frac{A(t)}{C(t)} \\quad \\implies \\quad A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)\n$$\n\nSystemic clearance, $CL$, is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. The rate of elimination can, therefore, also be expressed as the product of clearance and the plasma concentration:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\n\nFrom our initial differential equation, the rate of elimination is also $k A(t)$. We can equate these two expressions for the rate of elimination:\n$$\nk A(t) = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $A(t)$ from the definition of the volume of distribution into this equation:\n$$\nk (V \\cdot C(t)) = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\n\nAssuming $C(t)$ is not identically zero (which is true for a finite time after drug administration), we can divide both sides by $C(t)$. We can also divide by $V$, which is a non-zero volume. This allows us to solve for the elimination rate constant $k$:\n$$\nk V = CL\n$$\n$$\nk = \\frac{CL}{V}\n$$\nThis equation establishes the fundamental relationship between the primary parameters $CL$ and $V$, and the hybrid parameter $k$.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n$CL = 5 \\, \\mathrm{L/h}$\n$V = 50 \\, \\mathrm{L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{5 \\, \\mathrm{L/h}}{50 \\, \\mathrm{L}} = 0.1 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the terminal half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The half-life is defined as the time required for the drug concentration to decrease to half its initial value. To find this, we first solve the differential equation $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k A(t)$. Since $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$ and $V$ is a constant, the equation can be written in terms of concentration as $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t)$. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, and its solution is:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nwhere $C(0)$ is the initial plasma concentration at $t=0$.\n\nBy the definition of half-life, at $t = t_{1/2}$, the concentration $C(t_{1/2})$ is half of the initial concentration $C(0)$:\n$$\nC(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the solution of the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} C(0) = C(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $C(0)$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nThis is the standard formula for the half-life of a first-order process.\n\nWe can now substitute the calculated value of $k = 0.1 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}} = 10 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nThis is the exact value for the half-life. As a decimal approximation rounded to four significant figures, $t_{1/2} \\approx 10 \\times 0.693147... \\approx 6.931 \\, \\mathrm{h}$.\n\nThe requested quantities are the elimination rate constant $k$ and the terminal half-life $t_{1/2}$.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, variables, and constants to derive a unique analytical expression and compute a numerical result. The language is objective and the provided numerical values are physiologically plausible.\n\nThe derivation of the hepatic clearance, $CL_h$, begins from two fundamental assumptions provided in the problem statement for a single, well-stirred liver compartment at steady state.\n\nFirst, the principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of drug entering the liver must equal the sum of the rate of drug leaving the liver via blood flow and the rate of drug eliminated by metabolism within the liver.\nThe rate of drug entering the liver is the product of hepatic blood flow, $Q_h$, and the input drug concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$ \\text{Rate in} = Q_h C_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nThe rate of drug leaving the liver in the blood is the product of hepatic blood flow and the output drug concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ \\text{Rate out (blood)} = Q_h C_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe rate of drug elimination is determined by the intrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{int}}$, and the concentration of unbound drug available to the metabolic enzymes within the liver, which we denote as $C_{u, \\mathrm{liver}}$. Since the kinetics are linear, the rate of elimination is:\n$$ \\text{Rate of elimination} = CL_{\\mathrm{int}} C_{u, \\mathrm{liver}} $$\nThe mass balance equation at steady state is therefore:\n$$ Q_h C_{\\mathrm{in}} = Q_h C_{\\mathrm{out}} + CL_{\\mathrm{int}} C_{u, \\mathrm{liver}} $$\n\nSecond, the well-stirred compartment model assumes that the drug is instantaneously and uniformly distributed throughout the liver tissue, such that the unbound drug concentration within the liver, $C_{u, \\mathrm{liver}}$, is equal to the unbound drug concentration in the venous blood leaving the liver. The total concentration in the venous outflow is $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$, and the fraction of unbound drug is $f_u$. Therefore, the unbound concentration in the venous outflow is $f_u C_{\\mathrm{out}}$. The assumption is expressed as:\n$$ C_{u, \\mathrm{liver}} = f_u C_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\n\nWe can now substitute the second expression into the first (the mass balance equation) to eliminate the internal liver concentration variable $C_{u, \\mathrm{liver}}$:\n$$ Q_h C_{\\mathrm{in}} = Q_h C_{\\mathrm{out}} + CL_{\\mathrm{int}} (f_u C_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\nOur goal is to find an expression for hepatic clearance, $CL_h$.
