Dwell-Time Probability Density Function $f(t)$**\n\nThe problem states that dissociation is a memoryless process with a constant rate $k_{\\text{off}}$. This implies that the dwell time $T$ of the complex is a random variable following an exponential distribution.\n\nLet $S(t) = P(T > t)$ be the survival probability, i.e., the probability that the complex has not dissociated by time $t$. For a memoryless process, the rate of change of the survival probability is proportional to the current survival probability:\n$$ \\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -k_{\\text{off}} S(t) $$\nWith the initial condition $S(0) = 1$ (the complex exists at $t=0$), this first-order linear ordinary differential equation has the solution:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}}t) $$\nThe probability density function (PDF), $f(t)$, is the negative derivative of the survival function:\n$$ f(t) = -\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\exp(-k_{\\text{off}}t)\\right) = -(-k_{\\text{off}})\\exp(-k_{\\text{off}}t) $$\n$$ f(t) = k_{\\text{off}}\\exp(-k_{\\text{off}}t) $$\nThis is the PDF for an exponential distribution with rate parameter $k_{\\text{off}}$.\n\nFor the two ligands, the specific PDFs are:\n- Ligand A: $f_A(t) = k_{\\text{off},A} \\exp(-k_{\\text{off},A}t)$\n- Ligand B: $f_B(t) = k_{\\text{off},B} \\exp(-k_{\\text{off},B}t)$\n\n**2. Probability of a Productive Signal per Binding Event, $p_N$**\n\nA productive signal requires $N$ sequential proofreading steps to complete before the complex dissociates. Consider a single proofreading step. Once the complex is formed, two independent, competing, memoryless processes occur:\n- Step completion, with rate $\\gamma$.\n- Dissociation, with rate $k_{\\text{off}}$.\n\nThe time until the first of these two events occurs is exponentially distributed with a total rate of $\\gamma + k_{\\text{off}}$. The probability that a specific event (e.g., step completion) occurs first is the ratio of its rate to the total rate.\n\nThus, the probability that a single proofreading step completes successfully before dissociation is:\n$$ p_{\\text{step}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma + k_{\\text{off}}} $$\nFor a productive signal, all $N$ steps must complete in sequence. Since each step is an independent trial with the same success probability $p_{\\text{step}}$, the total probability of $N$ consecutive successes is:\n$$ p_N(k_{\\text{off}}, \\gamma, N) = (p_{\\text{step}})^N = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma + k_{\\text{off}}}\\right)^N $$\n\n**3. Mean Productive Signaling Rate per Unbound TCR**\n\nBinding events for a single unbound TCR are modeled as a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_{\\text{bind}} = k_{\\text{on}}[\\mathrm{pMHC}]$. This rate represents the average number of TCR-pMHC complexes formed per unit time per unbound TCR.\n\nEach binding event is an independent trial that leads to a productive signal with probability $p_N$, as derived above. This scenario is known as \"thinning\" a Poisson process. If events from a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ are independently selected with probability $p$, the resulting stream of selected events is also a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda p$.\n\nTherefore, the mean rate of productive signaling per unbound TCR, denoted as $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{signal}}$, is the rate of binding events multiplied by the probability that each event is productive:\n$$ \\mathcal{R}_{\\text{signal}} = \\lambda_{\\text{bind}} \\times p_N = k_{\\text{on}}[\\mathrm{pMHC}] \\, p_N(k_{\\text{off}}, \\gamma, N) $$\nUnder the low occupancy assumption, the number of unbound TCRs is approximately constant, so this rate is directly proportional to the total signaling rate of the cell.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Fold-Discrimination Ratio $R$**\n\nThe fold-discrimination ratio $R$ is defined as the ratio of the productive signaling rates for ligand A to ligand B:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{signal}, A}}{\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{signal}, B}} $$\nUsing the expression for $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{signal}}$ derived above:\n$$ \\mathcal{R}_{\\text{signal}, A} = k_{\\text{on},A}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{A}] \\, p_N(k_{\\text{off},A}, \\gamma, N) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{R}_{\\text{signal}, B} = k_{\\text{on},B}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{B}] \\, p_N(k_{\\text{off},B}, \\gamma, N) $$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{A}] \\, p_N(k_{\\text{off},A}, \\gamma, N)}{k_{\\text{on},B}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{B}] \\, p_N(k_{\\text{off},B}, \\gamma, N)} $$\nNow, substituting the expression for $p_N$:\n$$ R = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{A}]}{k_{\\text{on},B}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{B}]} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma + k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right)^N}{\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma + k_{\\text{off},B}}\\right)^N} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{A}]}{k_{\\text{on},B}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{B}]} \\left(\\frac{\\gamma + k_{\\text{off},B}}{\\gamma + k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right)^N $$\nWe are given the following values:\n- $k_{\\text{on},A} = k_{\\text{on},B} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{A}] = [\\mathrm{pMHC}_{B}] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n- $k_{\\text{off},A} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{off},B} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $N = 4$\n- $\\gamma = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe pre-factor $k_{\\text{on},A}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{A}] / (k_{\\text{on},B}[\\mathrm{pMHC}_{B}])$ is equal to $1$ since the on-rates and concentrations are identical for both ligands. Therefore, the discrimination ratio simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma + k_{\\text{off},B}}{\\gamma + k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right)^N $$\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 3.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\\right)^{4} = \\left(\\frac{4.0}{1.1}\\right)^{4} $$\nCalculating the value:\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{40}{11}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{2560000}{14641} \\approx 174.8446144... $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $175$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{175}$$", "id": "4317560"}, {"introduction": "Once a pathogen is detected, receptors like TLR4 initiate complex intracellular signaling cascades to orchestrate the cellular response.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires calculating the probabilities of a developing B cell maturing with either a kappa ($\\kappa$) or a lambda ($\\lambda$) light chain, and then normalizing these probabilities to find the respective fractions among the mature B-cell population.\n\nLet $P(\\text{Prod}_{L})$ be the probability of achieving at least one productive rearrangement at a given locus $L \\in \\{\\kappa, \\lambda\\}$. Given that each locus has two independent alleles, this probability is:\n$$ P(\\text{Prod}_{L}) = 1 - (1 - r_L)^2 $$\n\nThe calculation proceeds by analyzing the outcomes at the $\\kappa$ locus first, followed by the $\\lambda$ locus for cells that fail to mature at the $\\kappa$ stage.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Kappa ($\\kappa$) Locus**\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of obtaining at least one productive rearrangement at the $\\kappa$ locus using $r_{\\kappa} = 0.35$:\n$$ P(\\text{Prod}_{\\kappa}) = 1 - (1 - r_{\\kappa})^2 = 1 - (1 - 0.35)^2 = 1 - (0.65)^2 = 1 - 0.4225 = 0.5775 $$\nA cell matures with a $\\kappa$ chain if a productive rearrangement occurs and the resulting BCR is either non-self-reactive initially or becomes non-self-reactive after successful receptor editing. The probability for a productive receptor to be or become non-self-reactive is $(1 - q_{\\kappa}) + q_{\\kappa} e_{\\kappa}$.\nLet $P(\\text{Mat}_{\\kappa})$ be the total probability that a cell matures using a $\\kappa$ chain.\n$$ P(\\text{Mat}_{\\kappa}) = P(\\text{Prod}_{\\kappa}) \\times [ (1 - q_{\\kappa}) + q_{\\kappa} e_{\\kappa} ] $$\nUsing the given values $q_{\\kappa} = 0.60$ and $e_{\\kappa} = 0.70$:\n$$ P(\\text{Mat}_{\\kappa}) = 0.5775 \\times [ (1 - 0.60) + (0.60 \\times 0.70) ] $$\n$$ P(\\text{Mat}_{\\kappa}) = 0.5775 \\times [ 0.40 + 0.42 ] = 0.5775 \\times 0.82 = 0.47355 $$\n\n**2. Transition to the Lambda ($\\lambda$) Locus**\n\nA cell switches to the $\\lambda$ locus if it fails to produce a mature $\\kappa$ chain. This failure can occur in two disjoint ways:\n(a) No productive rearrangement occurs at the $\\kappa$ locus. The probability is $1 - P(\\text{Prod}_{\\kappa})$.\n(b) A productive rearrangement occurs, but it is self-reactive, and subsequent receptor editing fails. The probability is $P(\\text{Prod}_{\\kappa}) \\times q_{\\kappa} \\times (1 - e_{\\kappa})$.\n\nLet $P(\\text{Switch})$ be the total probability of switching to the $\\lambda$ locus.\n$$ P(\\text{Switch}) = (1 - P(\\text{Prod}_{\\kappa})) + P(\\text{Prod}_{\\kappa}) \\times q_{\\kappa} \\times (1 - e_{\\kappa}) $$\n$$ P(\\text{Switch}) = (1 - 0.5775) + 0.5775 \\times 0.60 \\times (1 - 0.70) $$\n$$ P(\\text{Switch}) = 0.4225 + 0.5775 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.30 $$\n$$ P(\\text{Switch}) = 0.4225 + 0.10395 = 0.52645 $$\nAs a check, the probability of maturing at the $\\kappa$ locus plus the probability of switching must sum to $1$. Indeed, $P(\\text{Mat}_{\\kappa}) + P(\\text{Switch}) = 0.47355 + 0.52645 = 1.0$.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Lambda ($\\lambda$) Locus**\n\nFor the sub-population of cells that switch to the $\\lambda$ locus, we repeat the analysis. First, we find the probability of a productive rearrangement at the $\\lambda$ locus, using $r_{\\lambda} = 0.30$:\n$$ P(\\text{Prod}_{\\lambda}) = 1 - (1 - r_{\\lambda})^2 = 1 - (1 - 0.30)^2 = 1 - (0.70)^2 = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51 $$\nThe conditional probability of maturing with a $\\lambda$ chain, given the cell has switched, is:\n$$ P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda} | \\text{Switch}) = P(\\text{Prod}_{\\lambda}) \\times [ (1 - q_{\\lambda}) + q_{\\lambda} e_{\\lambda} ] $$\nUsing the given values $q_{\\lambda} = 0.50$ and $e_{\\lambda} = 0.75$:\n$$ P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda} | \\text{Switch}) = 0.51 \\times [ (1 - 0.50) + (0.50 \\times 0.75) ] $$\n$$ P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda} | \\text{Switch}) = 0.51 \\times [ 0.50 + 0.375 ] = 0.51 \\times 0.875 = 0.44625 $$\nThe absolute probability of maturing with a $\\lambda$ chain, $P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda})$, is the probability of switching multiplied by this conditional probability:\n$$ P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda}) = P(\\text{Switch}) \\times P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda} | \\text{Switch}) $$\n$$ P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda}) = 0.52645 \\times 0.44625 = 0.2349140625 $$\n\n**4. Normalization and Final Fractions**\n\nThe total probability of a cell maturing is the sum of the probabilities of maturing with a $\\kappa$ or a $\\lambda$ chain:\n$$ P(\\text{Total Maturation}) = P(\\text{Mat}_{\\kappa}) + P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda}) $$\n$$ P(\\text{Total Maturation}) = 0.47355 + 0.2349140625 = 0.7084640625 $$\nThe fraction of mature B cells using a $\\kappa$ chain, $f_{\\kappa}$, is:\n$$ f_{\\kappa} = \\frac{P(\\text{Mat}_{\\kappa})}{P(\\text{Total Maturation})} = \\frac{0.47355}{0.7084640625} \\approx 0.66841703 $$\nThe fraction of mature B cells using a $\\lambda$ chain, $f_{\\lambda}$, is:\n$$ f_{\\lambda} = \\frac{P(\\text{Mat}_{\\lambda})}{P(\\text{Total Maturation})} = \\frac{0.2349140625}{0.7084640625} \\approx 0.33158297 $$\nRounding these fractions to four significant figures gives:\n$$ f_{\\kappa} \\approx 0.6684 $$\n$$ f_{\\lambda} \\approx 0.3316 $$\nThese fractions represent the expected usage distribution of $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ light chains in the mature B cell population.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.6684 & 0.3316\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4317616"}]}
