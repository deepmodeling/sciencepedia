It is based on established principles of translation kinetics and standard high-throughput experimental data (Ribo-seq, SILAC, polysome profiling). All necessary data are provided and are consistent with one another.\n\nThe solution is derived from the fundamental principle of flux conservation in a steady-state system.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationships in Steady-State Translation**\n    The problem states that translation is in a steady state, characterized by a constant flux of ribosomes, $J$, along the entire coding sequence of length $L = 360$ codons. The quantity $J$ represents the number of proteins synthesized per mRNA per unit time, given as $J = 6.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n    For any given codon position $i$, the average ribosome occupancy (or density), $\\rho_i$, is related to the flux $J$ and the average time a ribosome dwells at that position, $t_i$. This relationship is an application of Little's Law from queueing theory:\n    $$ \\rho_i = J \\cdot t_i $$\n    A higher occupancy implies a longer dwell time for a constant flux.\n\n    The codon-specific elongation rate, $k_i$, is defined as the inverse of the dwell time:\n    $$ k_i = \\frac{1}{t_i} $$\n    Substituting this into the occupancy equation, we find an inverse relationship between occupancy and elongation rate:\n    $$ \\rho_i = \\frac{J}{k_i} \\implies k_i = \\frac{J}{\\rho_i} $$\n    This equation shows that a high ribosome occupancy (a bottleneck) corresponds to a low local elongation rate.\n\n2.  **Relating Ribo-seq Data to Ribosome Occupancy**\n    Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) measures ribosome positions by sequencing the mRNA fragments protected by them. The number of A-site counts at a codon $i$, $C_i$, is assumed to be directly proportional to the true average ribosome occupancy at that position, $\\rho_i$. This proportionality extends to the entire transcript: the fraction of total counts at a position $i$ is equal to the fraction of total ribosomes at that position.\n    $$ \\frac{C_i}{S} = \\frac{\\rho_i}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}} $$\n    where $S = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} C_j$ is the total number of Ribo-seq counts for the gene, given as $S = 3.6 \\times 10^{4}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\rho_j$ is the average total number of ribosomes bound per mRNA, given as $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 9$.\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the occupancy $\\rho_i$ in terms of the experimental data:\n    $$ \\rho_i = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{C_i}{S} $$\n\n3.  **Calculating Codon-Specific Elongation Rates**\n    By equating the two expressions for $\\rho_i$, we can derive a formula for the elongation rate $k_i$ based on the provided experimental measurements:\n    $$ \\frac{J}{k_i} = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{C_i}{S} $$\n    Solving for $k_i$:\n    $$ k_i = \\frac{J \\cdot S}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot C_i} $$\n\n    We can now calculate the specific elongation rates for codons $i=120$ and $i=200$.\n    For codon $i=120$, with $C_{120} = 4.8 \\times 10^{2}$:\n    $$ k_{120} = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (3.6 \\times 10^{4})}{(9) \\cdot (4.8 \\times 10^{2})} = \\frac{2160}{4320}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n    For codon $i=200$, with $C_{200} = 1.8 \\times 10^{2}$:\n    $$ k_{200} = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (3.6 \\times 10^{4})}{(9) \\cdot (1.8 \\times 10^{2})} = \\frac{2160}{1620}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{216}{162}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{4}{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\n4.  **Quantifying the Relative Bottleneck Severity**\n    The problem asks for the kinetic bottleneck severity at position $i=120$ relative to position $i=200$, quantified as the fold difference $S^{\\star} = \\frac{k_{200}}{k_{120}}$.\n    A more direct way to calculate this ratio is to use the symbolic expression for $k_i$:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = \\frac{k_{200}}{k_{120}} = \\frac{\\frac{J \\cdot S}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot C_{200}}}{\\frac{J \\cdot S}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot C_{120}}} $$\n    The common factor $\\frac{J \\cdot S}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$ cancels out, leaving a simple inverse ratio of the Ribo-seq counts:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = \\frac{C_{120}}{C_{200}} $$\n    This important result shows that the ratio of elongation rates can be determined directly from the ratio of ribosome footprint counts, without needing to know the absolute flux $J$, total ribosomes $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, or total counts $S$.\n\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = \\frac{4.8 \\times 10^{2}}{1.8 \\times 10^{2}} = \\frac{4.8}{1.8} = \\frac{48}{18} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n    The value of the ratio is a unitless quantity.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Rounding**\n    To express the result as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we compute the value of the fraction:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = \\frac{8}{3} = 2.6666... $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = 2.667 $$\n\nThis result indicates that the elongation rate at codon $200$ is approximately $2.667$ times faster than at codon $120$.

This is accomplished using a thermodynamic double mutant cycle, which compares the effect of a mutation in one background versus another. The interaction energy is defined as the deviation from additivity of the mutational effects.\n\nThe change in stability due to mutation A in the WT background is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{A}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nThe change in stability due to mutation B in the WT background is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nIf the two mutations were independent (non-interacting), their combined effect on the stability of the double mutant would be simply additive:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB, additive}} = \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}} + \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}} + (\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{A}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}) + (\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}) = \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nThe interaction free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}$, is the difference between the experimentally observed stability of the double mutant, $\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB}}$, and the stability predicted by the additive model, $\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB, additive}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{int}} = \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB, additive}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the additive model yields the final formula for the interaction energy:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{int}} = \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB}} - (\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}) = \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{A}} - \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{B}} + \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the calculated $\\Delta G^{0}$ values into this equation to find the numerical value of the interaction energy. We will retain precision during intermediate steps and round at the end.\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{int}} = (23.23) - (24.7) - (30.9) + (35.0)\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{int}} = (23.23 + 35.0) - (24.7 + 30.9)\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{int}} = 58.23 - 55.6\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{int}} = 2.63\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The result, $2.63\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, already has three significant figures.\n\nThe sign of the interaction energy provides insight into the nature of the epistasis between the residues. Both single mutations are destabilizing, as $\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{A}}  \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{B}}  \\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{WT}}$. The calculated interaction energy $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}$ is positive ($+2.63\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$). This means the observed stability of the double mutant ($\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB}} = 23.23\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) is greater than what would be expected from a simple summation of the individual destabilizing effects ($\\Delta G^{0}_{\\mathrm{AB, additive}} = 24.7 + 30.9 - 35.0 = 20.6\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$). The combined destabilizing effect is less severe than the sum of its parts. This phenomenon, where the mutations buffer each other's deleterious effects, is known as positive or synergistic epistasis. The positive coupling energy indicates a favorable interaction between the mutated sites relative to the wild-type interactions, which contributes to the overall folding cooperativity.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the value of the interaction free energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.63}$$", "id": "4380295"}]}
