The Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle generates reduced electron carriers Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) and Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FADH$_2$), which donate electrons to the ETC.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cellular bioenergetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of protons under the specified conditions of a tightly coupled, steady-state mitochondrion. In such a system, the rate of proton pumping into the intermembrane space by the Electron Transport Chain ($ETC$) is precisely balanced by the rate of proton translocation back into the mitochondrial matrix to drive $ATP$ synthesis and associated transport processes. This allows us to treat the problem as a simple stoichiometric calculation based on a \"proton budget\".\n\nLet us define the given stoichiometric parameters:\n1.  The number of protons pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane per molecule of mitochondrial $NADH$ oxidized is $P_{NADH} = 10$.\n2.  The number of protons pumped per molecule of mitochondrial $FADH_2$ oxidized is $P_{FADH_2} = 6$.\n3.  The number of protons required to flow back into the matrix for the synthesis and export of one molecule of $ATP$ is $C_{ATP} = 4$. This cost includes both the rotary catalysis by the $F_1F_\\text{o}$-ATP synthase and the transport of substrates ($ADP$ and inorganic phosphate, $P_i$).\n\nWe are asked to compute the expected $ATP$ yield per molecule of $NADH$ and $FADH_2$. This yield is a dimensionless ratio.\n\nFirst, let us calculate the $ATP$ yield per mitochondrial $NADH$, which we will denote as $Y_{ATP/NADH}$. For each molecule of $NADH$ that is oxidized, $P_{NADH} = 10$ protons are made available. Each molecule of $ATP$ synthesized and exported consumes $C_{ATP} = 4$ protons. The total number of $ATP$ molecules that can be produced from the protons pumped by one $NADH$ is the ratio of protons supplied to protons consumed per $ATP$.\n\n$$Y_{ATP/NADH} = \\frac{P_{NADH}}{C_{ATP}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$$Y_{ATP/NADH} = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5$$\n\nThus, the theoretical yield is $2.5$ $ATP$ molecules per molecule of mitochondrial $NADH$.\n\nSecond, we perform an analogous calculation for the $ATP$ yield per mitochondrial $FADH_2$, denoted as $Y_{ATP/FADH_2}$. For each molecule of $FADH_2$ that is oxidized, $P_{FADH_2} = 6$ protons are pumped into the intermembrane space. The cost per $ATP$ remains the same, $C_{ATP} = 4$ protons. The total number of $ATP$ molecules that can be produced from the protons pumped by one $FADH_2$ is:\n\n$$Y_{ATP/FADH_2} = \\frac{P_{FADH_2}}{C_{ATP}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$$Y_{ATP/FADH_2} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5$$\n\nThus, the theoretical yield is $1.5$ $ATP$ molecules per molecule of mitochondrial $FADH_2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final result to be expressed as a row matrix with two entries, ordered as ($NADH$, $FADH_2$).\n\nThe resulting yields are $2.5$ for $NADH$ and $1.5$ for $FADH_2$.
