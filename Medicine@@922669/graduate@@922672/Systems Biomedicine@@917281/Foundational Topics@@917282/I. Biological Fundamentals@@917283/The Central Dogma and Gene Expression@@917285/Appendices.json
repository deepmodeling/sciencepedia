This process is situated within the first step of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, namely the transcription of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into ribonucleic acid (RNA). We are tasked with deriving an expression for this rate and then computing its numerical value.\n\nLet $R_X$ be the steady-state rate of production of full-length $X$ transcripts. According to the problem statement, this rate can be expressed as the product of the initiation rate of transcription for gene $X$, $\\alpha_X$, and the probability that a transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex initiated at the $X$ promoter survives its transit through the region of overlap with gene $Y$. Let this survival probability be denoted by $P_{\\text{surv},X}$.\n$$R_X = \\alpha_X \\cdot P_{\\text{surv},X}$$\nOur primary task is to derive an expression for $P_{\\text{surv},X}$.\n\nAn RNAP complex transcribing gene $X$ (an $X$-RNAP) enters a region of length $O$ where it can encounter RNAP complexes transcribing gene $Y$ ($Y$-RNAPs) moving in the opposite direction. The elongation speed for both types of RNAP is a constant, $v$.

The problem states that these encounters, from the perspective of a tagged $X$-RNAP, can be modeled as a Poisson process. Furthermore, each encounter leads to a termination event with a fixed probability $q_X$. This is a classic Poisson thinning scenario. If the rate of encounters is $\\lambda_{\\text{enc}}$, then the rate of fatal termination events, $\\lambda_{\\text{term}}$, is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{term}} = q_X \\lambda_{\\text{enc}}$$\nThe number of fatal termination events, $N_{\\text{term}}$, that occur during the transit time $\\tau_O$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = \\lambda_{\\text{term}} \\tau_O$.
