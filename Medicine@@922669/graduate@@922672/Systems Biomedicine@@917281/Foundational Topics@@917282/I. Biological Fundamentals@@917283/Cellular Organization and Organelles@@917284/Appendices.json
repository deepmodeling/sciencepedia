Consider the following mechanistic and biophysical description, grounded in well-tested kinetic and thermodynamic principles. The protein ($P$) first binds to a TOM receptor site ($R$) on the outer membrane to form a receptor–protein complex ($PR$). This complex then translocates through the TOM channel to engage the TIM23 translocase, completing import into the matrix. The two essential steps are modeled as follows:\n\n1.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe total import flux $J_{\\text{tot}}$ is defined as the product of the translocation rate per occupied receptor, $k_{\\text{trans}}$, and the number of occupied receptors, $N_{\\text{occ}}$.\n$$J_{\\text{tot}} = k_{\\text{trans}} N_{\\text{occ}}$$\nTo find $N_{\\text{occ}}$, we use the quasi-steady-state assumption for the receptor-protein complex, $PR$. Let $N_{R}$ be the total number of receptors, $N_{\\text{occ}}$ be the number of occupied receptors, and $N_{\\text{free}}$ be the number of free receptors. We have $N_{R} = N_{\\text{occ}} + N_{\\text{free}}$.\n\nAt steady state, the rate of formation of the $PR$ complex equals its rate of disappearance. The formation rate is proportional to the concentration of free receptors and the protein concentration $[P]$. The rate of formation is $k_{\\text{on}} [P] N_{\\text{free}}$. The $PR$ complex can disappear via two pathways: dissociation back to $R+P$ with rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$, and forward translocation into the matrix with rate constant $k_{\\text{trans}}$. The total rate of disappearance is thus $(k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{trans}}) N_{\\text{occ}}$.\n\nEquating the rates:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [P] N_{\\text{free}} = (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{trans}}) N_{\\text{occ}}$$\nSubstituting $N_{\\text{free}} = N_{R} - N_{\\text{occ}}$ into the equation:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [P] (N_{R} - N_{\\text{occ}}) = (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{trans}}) N_{\\text{occ}}$$\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [P] N_{R} - k_{\\text{on}} [P] N_{\\text{occ}} = (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{trans}}) N_{\\text{occ}}$$\nSolving for $N_{\\text{occ}}$:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [P] N_{R} = (k_{\\text{on}} [P] + k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{trans}}) N_{\\text{occ}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{occ}} = N_{R} \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} [P]}{k_{\\text{on}} [P] + k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{trans}}}$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $N_{\\text{occ}}$ into the equation for the total flux $J_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$J_{\\text{tot}} = k_{\\text{trans}} \\left( N_{R} \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} [P]}{k_{\\text{on}} [P] + k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{trans}}} \\right)$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the total import rate per mitochondrion.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value.\nFirst, calculate the translocation rate constant, $k_{\\text{trans}}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the biophysics of biomolecular condensates, mathematically well-posed, and all terms and parameters are defined with sufficient precision to allow for a unique and meaningful solution. The model, while a simplification, is built on first principles such as mass conservation and established frameworks like the Maxwell model for viscoelasticity. All required data for the computational task are provided, and no contradictions are present. We may therefore proceed with the derivation of the required quantities.\n\nThe modeling task is to derive expressions for the steady-state nucleolus radius $R^{\\ast}$, the effective viscosity $\\eta$, and the Deborah number $\\mathrm{De}$ based on the provided theoretical framework.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Steady-State Condensate Radius ($R^{\\ast}$)**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the condensate's size is the mass conservation equation for an open system, expressed in terms of volume $V(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = p_{a} A - k_{v} V\n$$\nHere, $p_{a}$ is the rate of material production per unit area, $k_{v}$ is the rate constant for volumetric material loss, $A(t)$ is the surface area, and $V(t)$ is the volume. The condensate is modeled as a sphere of radius $R(t)$, so its volume and area are given by:\n$$\nV(t) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R(t)^{3}\n$$\n$$\nA(t) = 4\\pi R(t)^{2}\n$$\nTo find the equation for the time evolution of the radius, $R(t)$, we substitute these geometric relations into the mass balance equation. First, we express $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ in terms of $\\frac{dR}{dt}$ using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(3 R^2 \\frac{dR}{dt}\\right) = 4\\pi R^2 \\frac{dR}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting this and the expressions for $A$ and $V$ into the balance equation yields:\n$$\n4\\pi R^2 \\frac{dR}{dt} = p_{a} (4\\pi R^2) - k_{v} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right)\n$$\nAssuming a non-zero radius, $R > 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $4\\pi R^2$ to obtain the ordinary differential equation for the radius:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = p_{a} - \\frac{k_{v}}{3} R\n$$\nThe steady-state radius, $R^{\\ast}$, is found by setting the rate of change of the radius to zero, $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$. This condition represents a state where the production and loss fluxes are perfectly balanced.\n$$\n0 = p_{a} - \\frac{k_{v}}{3} R^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving for $R^{\\ast}$ gives:\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{3 p_{a}}{k_{v}}\n$$\nThe model accounts for RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) inhibition through the fractional inhibition parameter $f$, which modifies the production rate per area $p_{a}$ as $p_{a} = p_{0}(1 - f)$, where $p_{0}$ is the uninhibited rate. Substituting this into the expression for $R^{\\ast}$, we obtain the final formula for the steady-state radius:\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{3 p_{0} (1 - f)}{k_{v}}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Material Properties ($\\eta$ and $\\mathrm{De}$)**\n\nThe material properties are described within the framework of linear viscoelasticity, specifically using the Maxwell model. In this model, the stress-relaxation time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}$, is defined by the ratio of the effective viscosity $\\eta$ to the effective elastic modulus $G_{0}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}} = \\frac{\\eta}{G_{0}}\n$$\nThe problem closes this model by proposing that the macroscopic relaxation time is inversely proportional to a microscopic, activity-controlled turnover rate, $k_{\\mathrm{turn}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{turn}}}\n$$\nThe turnover rate $k_{\\mathrm{turn}}$ is defined as a linear combination of the production and loss processes:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{turn}} = \\beta_{p} p_{a} + \\beta_{v} k_{v}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_{p}$ and $\\beta_{v}$ are proportionality constants. By substituting the expression for the inhibited production rate, $p_{a} = p_{0}(1 - f)$, we get:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{turn}} = \\beta_{p} p_{0} (1 - f) + \\beta_{v} k_{v}\n$$\nFrom these relations, we can derive the expressions for $\\eta$ and $\\mathrm{De}$.\n\nThe effective viscosity, $\\eta$, is derived by rearranging the Maxwell relation: $\\eta = G_{0} \\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}$. Substituting $\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{turn}}$, we find:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{G_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{turn}}} = \\frac{G_{0}}{\\beta_{p} p_{0} (1 - f) + \\beta_{v} k_{v}}\n$$\nThe Deborah number, $\\mathrm{De}$, characterizes the fluidity of the material by comparing its internal relaxation timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}$ to an external observation timescale $T_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{De} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}}{T_{\\mathrm{obs}}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{turn}}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathrm{De} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{turn}} T_{\\mathrm{obs}}} = \\frac{1}{(\\beta_{p} p_{0} (1 - f) + \\beta_{v} k_{v}) T_{\\mathrm{obs}}}\n$$\n\n**3. Summary of Computational Formulae**\n\nThe computational task requires the implementation of the following three derived equations for each parameter set provided:\n\n1.  Steady-state radius ($R^{\\ast}$):\n    $$R^{\\ast} = \\frac{3 p_{0}(1 - f)}{k_{v}}$$\n2.  Effective viscosity ($\\eta$):\n    $$\\eta = \\frac{G_{0}}{\\beta_{p}\\,p_{0}\\,(1 - f) + \\beta_{v}\\,k_{v}}$$\n3.  Deborah number ($\\mathrm{De}$):\n    $$\\mathrm{De} = \\frac{1}{(\\beta_{p}\\,p_{0}\\,(1 - f) + \\beta_{v}\\,k_{v}) T_{\\mathrm{obs}}}$$\n\nThese formulae are implemented in the provided Python code to compute the required triplets $[R^{\\ast}, \\eta, \\mathrm{De}]$ for the specified test cases. All units are handled as specified in the problem statement ($p_0$ in $\\mu m/s$, $k_v$ in $s^{-1}$, $\\beta_p$ in $\\mu m^{-1}$, $G_0$ in $Pa$, $T_{obs}$ in $s$) to ensure the results are in the correct units ($R^{\\ast}$ in $\\mu m$, $\\eta$ in $Pa \\cdot s$, and $\\mathrm{De}$ dimensionless).
