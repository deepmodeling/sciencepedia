A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation followed by a physiological interpretation. First, we compute the alveolar oxygen partial pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2}$). Second, we compute the alveolar-to-arterial oxygen gradient ($A\\text{–}a$ gradient). Third, we use these results to determine the most likely cause of hypoxemia.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Alveolar Oxygen Partial Pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2}$)**\n\nThe alveolar oxygen partial pressure is determined by the balance between the oxygen entering the alveoli from inspired air and the oxygen being removed by pulmonary capillary blood, as well as the diluting effect of alveolar carbon dioxide. This relationship is described by the alveolar gas equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2} = \\left[ F_{\\mathrm{IO}_2} \\times (P_B - P_{H_2O}) \\right] - \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{ACO}_2}}{R}$$\nHere, $F_{\\mathrm{IO}_2}$ is the fraction of inspired oxygen, $P_B$ is the barometric pressure, $P_{H_2O}$ is the partial pressure of water vapor at body temperature, $P_{\\mathrm{ACO}_2}$ is the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and $R$ is the respiratory quotient. The term $F_{\\mathrm{IO}_2} \\times (P_B - P_{H_2O})$ represents the partial pressure of inspired oxygen ($P_{\\mathrm{IO}_2}$) after it has been humidified in the upper airways.\n\nIn clinical practice, it is a standard and valid assumption that the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{\\mathrm{ACO}_2}$) is in near-perfect equilibrium with the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2}$) due to the high diffusibility of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$. Thus, we can substitute $P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2}$ for $P_{\\mathrm{ACO}_2}$ in the equation.\n\nUsing the provided values:\n- $F_{\\mathrm{IO}_2} = 0.21$\n- $P_B = 760 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $P_{H_2O} = 47 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2} = 60 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $R = 0.8$\n\nWe substitute these values into the alveolar gas equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2} = \\left[ 0.21 \\times (760 - 47) \\right] - \\frac{60}{0.8}$$\nFirst, calculate the pressure of humidified inspired oxygen:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{IO}_2} = 0.21 \\times (713) = 149.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nNext, calculate the effect of carbon dioxide displacement:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2}}{R} = \\frac{60}{0.8} = 75 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nFinally, calculate $P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2} = 149.73 - 75 = 74.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Alveolar-to-Arterial Oxygen Gradient ($A\\text{–}a$ Gradient)**\n\nThe $A\\text{–}a$ gradient is defined as the difference between the calculated alveolar oxygen partial pressure and the measured arterial oxygen partial pressure:\n$$A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} = P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2} - P_{\\mathrm{aO}_2}$$\nWe use the calculated $P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2}$ and the given $P_{\\mathrm{aO}_2}$:\n- $P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2} = 74.73 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\mathrm{aO}_2} = 55 \\text{ mmHg}$\n\n$$A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} = 74.73 - 55 = 19.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to four significant figures, which $19.73$ already is.\n\n**Part 3: Physiological Interpretation**\n\nWe must determine if the patient's hypoxemia ($P_{\\mathrm{aO}_2} = 55 \\text{ mmHg}$) is most consistent with ventilation-perfusion ($V/Q$) mismatch, right-to-left shunt, or global hypoventilation. To do this, we analyze both the $P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2}$ and the $A\\text{–}a$ gradient.\n\n1.  **Analyze $P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2}$**: The patient's $P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2}$ is $60 \\text{ mmHg}$. The normal range is typically $35\\text{–}45 \\text{ mmHg}$. A $P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2}$ of $60 \\text{ mmHg}$ indicates significant hypercapnia, which is a cardinal sign of global hypoventilation (i.e., the lungs as a whole are not exchanging enough gas with the atmosphere).\n\n2.  **Analyze the $A\\text{–}a$ Gradient**: We calculated the patient's $A\\text{–}a$ gradient to be $19.73 \\text{ mmHg}$. We should compare this to the expected normal gradient for the patient's age. Using the provided formula:\n    $$\\text{Expected normal } A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} = \\frac{\\text{age}}{4} + 4 = \\frac{70}{4} + 4 = 17.5 + 4 = 21.5 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n    The patient's calculated gradient of $19.73 \\text{ mmHg}$ is within the expected normal range for their age ($21.5 \\text{ mmHg}$).\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings**:\n    - **Global Hypoventilation**: This condition is characterized by a high $P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2}$ and a *normal* $A\\text{–}a$ gradient. The problem is not with gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane, but rather with insufficient fresh gas reaching the alveoli. The high alveolar $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ \"displaces\" alveolar $\\mathrm{O}_2$ (as seen in the alveolar gas equation), leading to low $P_{\\mathrm{AO}_2}$ and consequently low $P_{\\mathrm{aO}_2}$.\n    - **$V/Q$ Mismatch and Shunt**: Both of these conditions are characterized by an *elevated* $A\\text{–}a$ gradient. They represent inefficiencies in gas exchange at the level of the alveolar-capillary unit. In these cases, even if alveolar ventilation were normal, the blood would not be properly oxygenated, causing the difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen levels to widen.\n\nThe patient exhibits significant hypercapnia ($P_{\\mathrm{aCO}_2} = 60 \\text{ mmHg}$) and a normal $A\\text{–}a$ gradient ($19.73 \\text{ mmHg} \\approx 21.5 \\text{ mmHg}$). This combination of findings is the classic presentation of **global hypoventilation** as the primary cause of the hypoxemia. The low arterial oxygen is a direct consequence of the low alveolar oxygen, which in turn is caused by the high alveolar carbon dioxide.\n\nThus, the final computed $A\\text{–}a$ gradient is $19.73 \\text{ mmHg}$, and the most consistent diagnosis for the cause of hypoxemia is global hypoventilation.
