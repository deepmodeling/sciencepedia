Assume that signal propagation between any two nodes $s,t \\in V$ is restricted to geodesic paths, that is, paths of minimal length, and that if multiple geodesic paths exist between a given pair, then, absent further mechanistic detail, each geodesic is equally plausible as a conduit of information. Further, assume additivity across distinct source-target pairs and invariance under relabeling of nodes that preserves the geodesic structure.\n\nTask 1 (derivation): Starting from the definitions of geodesic distance and the symmetry assumption stated above for multiple geodesics, derive a scalar functional for betweenness centrality $C_{B}(v)$ that quantifies, for each $v \\in V$, the average fraction of geodesic paths between all unordered source-target pairs that traverse $v$, excluding cases where $v$ is an endpoint.

The distance $d(s,t)$ between two nodes $s, t \\in V$ is the length of a shortest path, or geodesic path, between them, where the length is the number of edges.\n\nLet $\\sigma_{st}$ be the total number of distinct geodesic paths between node $s$ and node $t$. Let $\\sigma_{st}(v)$ be the number of those geodesic paths that pass through an intermediate node $v \\in V$, where $v \\neq s$ and $v \\neq t$.\n\nThe problem states that all geodesic paths are equally plausible as conduits of information. Therefore, the fraction of geodesic-path-mediated communication between $s$ and $t$ that passes through $v$ is given by the ratio $\\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}$. If there is no path between $s$ and $t$, then $\\sigma_{st}=0$, and this contribution is defined as $0$.\n\nThe betweenness centrality of a node $v$ quantifies its importance in connecting other nodes in the network. It is defined by aggregating the fractional contributions from all possible pairs of source and target nodes. The problem specifies that the aggregation should be over all \"unordered source-target pairs\" that do not have $v$ as an endpoint. An unordered pair is a set of two distinct nodes $\\{s,t\\}$. The condition that $v$ is not an endpoint means $s \\neq v$ and $t \\neq v$. Thus, we must sum over all pairs $\\{s,t\\} \\subseteq V \\setminus \\{v\\}$.\n\nThe unnormalized betweenness centrality, which we denote as $C'_{B}(v)$, is the sum of these fractional contributions:\n$$\nC'_{B}(v) = \\sum_{\\{s,t\\} \\subseteq V \\setminus \\{v\\}} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n$$\nThis sum can be written more explicitly for computation by iterating over all distinct nodes $s, t \\in V$ such that $s \\neq v$, $t \\neq v$, and $s \\neq t$, and accounting for the fact that each unordered pair $\\{s,t\\}$ is counted twice in a sum over all ordered pairs $(s,t)$ and $(t,s)$. Since the graph is undirected, $\\sigma_{st} = \\sigma_{ts}$ and $\\sigma_{st}(v) = \\sigma_{ts}(v)$. We can write the sum over unique pairs (e.g., by imposing an arbitrary order on the nodes, denoted by $<$):\n$$\nC'_{B}(v) = \\sum_{s, t \\in V, s < t, s \\neq v, t \\neq v} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n$$\nA node $v$ lies on a geodesic path between $s$ and $t$ if and only if the triangle inequality on distances becomes an equality: $d(s,t) = d(s,v) + d(v,t)$. For such cases, the number of geodesic paths from $s$ to $t$ through $v$ is the product of the number of geodesic paths from $s$ to $v$ and from $v$ to $t$, i.e., $\\sigma_{st}(v) = \\sigma_{sv} \\cdot \\sigma_{vt}$.\n\nThe problem requires a normalization \"by averaging over all unordered pairs that do not involve $v$.\" The set of nodes not including $v$ is $V \\setminus \\{v\\}$, which has a size of $n-1$. The total number of unordered pairs of distinct nodes in this set is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\nN_v = \\binom{n-1}{2} = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}\n$$\nThis is the number of terms in the summation for $C'_{B}(v)$. To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of terms. This yields the normalized betweenness centrality, $C_{B}(v)$:\n$$\nC_{B}(v) = \\frac{C'_{B}(v)}{N_v} = \\frac{1}{\\binom{n-1}{2}} \\sum_{\\{s,t\\} \\subseteq V \\setminus \\{v\\}} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n$$\nThis is the required scalar functional.

Here, $a=\\frac{19}{6}$ and $b=-\\frac{7}{6}$.\nThe eigenvalues are:\n$\\lambda_1 = a+b = \\frac{19}{6} - \\frac{7}{6} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2$.\n$\\lambda_2 = a-b = \\frac{19}{6} - (-\\frac{7}{6}) = \\frac{26}{6} = \\frac{13}{3}$.\n\nNext, we compute $M_1 - M_2$:\n$$\nM_1 - M_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{13}{6} & -\\frac{13}{6} \\\\ -\\frac{13}{6} & \\frac{13}{6} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix has the form $\\begin{pmatrix} c & -c \\\\ -c & c \\end{pmatrix}$ with $c=\\frac{13}{6}$. Its eigenvalues are $c-c=0$ and $c+c=2c$.\nThe eigenvalues are:\n$\\lambda_3 = 0$.\n$\\lambda_4 = 2c = 2 \\left(\\frac{13}{6}\\right) = \\frac{13}{3}$.\n\nThe complete set of eigenvalues of $L_s$, denoted by the spectrum $\\sigma(L_s)$, is the collection of these four eigenvalues:\n$\\sigma(L_s) = \\{0, 2, \\frac{13}{3}, \\frac{13}{3}\\}$.\n\nNow we reason about the spectral consequences.\n**Structural Balance**: A signed graph is structurally balanced if its nodes can be partitioned into two sets (coalitions) such that all edges within a set are positive and all edges between the sets are negative. The network described is perfectly balanced with the partition being the two modules $\\mathcal{A}=\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\mathcal{B}=\\{3,4\\}$. A fundamental theorem in spectral graph theory for signed networks states that a signed graph is balanced if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of its signed Laplacian $L_s$ is $0$. Our computed spectrum is $\\{0, 2, \\frac{13}{3}, \\frac{13}{3}\\}$, and the smallest eigenvalue is indeed $0$. This confirms the structural balance of the network. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$ is of the form $(1, 1, -1, -1)^{\\top}$, which explicitly defines the two-partition structure of the balanced network.\n\n**Positive Semidefiniteness**: A symmetric matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are non-negative. The eigenvalues of $L_s$ are $\\{0, 2, \\frac{13}{3}, \\frac{13}{3}\\}$, all of which are $\\ge 0$. Therefore, $L_s$ is a positive semidefinite matrix. The positive semidefiniteness of the signed Laplacian is another direct indicator of structural balance. If the network were unbalanced (structurally frustrated), at least one eigenvalue would be negative, and $L_s$ would be indefinite.\n\nFinally, we report the spectral radius $\\rho(L_s)$. The spectral radius is the maximum absolute value of the eigenvalues.\n$$\n\\rho(L_s) = \\max\\{|\\lambda| : \\lambda \\in \\sigma(L_s)\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho(L_s) = \\max\\{|0|, |2|, |\\frac{13}{3}|, |\\frac{13}{3}|\\} = \\max\\{0, 2, \\frac{13}{3}\\}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{13}{3} = 4.333... > 2$, the spectral radius is $\\frac{13}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}}$$", "id": "4367476"}]}
