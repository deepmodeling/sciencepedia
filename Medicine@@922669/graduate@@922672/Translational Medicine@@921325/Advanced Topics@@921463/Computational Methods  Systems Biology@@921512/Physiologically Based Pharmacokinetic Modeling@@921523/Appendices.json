This first practice challenges you to derive the key equations for hepatic clearance from the fundamental principle of mass balance, using the widely applied 'well-stirred' model.

It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of mass conservation across the liver at steady state. The rate of drug entering the liver must equal the sum of the rate of drug leaving the liver and the rate of drug being eliminated within the liver. Let $Q_{h}$ be the hepatic blood flow, $C_{in}$ be the drug concentration in blood entering the liver, and $C_{out}$ be the drug concentration in blood leaving the liver. The rate of elimination is denoted by $R_{el}$. The mass balance equation is:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = \\text{Rate Out} + \\text{Rate of Elimination} $$\n$$ Q_{h} C_{in} = Q_{h} C_{out} + R_{el} $$\n\nThe problem states that elimination is a linear, first-order process dependent on the unbound drug concentration. The \"well-stirred\" model assumption dictates that the drug concentration throughout the liver is uniform and in equilibrium with the hepatic venous outflow concentration, $C_{out}$. Therefore, the unbound drug concentration available for metabolism within the liver is $f_{u} C_{out}$, where $f_{u}$ is the fraction of drug unbound in the blood.\n\nThe intrinsic hepatic clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}$, is defined as the proportionality constant between the rate of metabolism and the unbound drug concentration. Thus, the rate of elimination can be expressed as:\n$$ R_{el} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},h} \\times (f_{u} C_{out}) $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $R_{el}$ back into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$ Q_{h} C_{in} = Q_{h} C_{out} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h} C_{out} $$\nWe can factor out $C_{out}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$ Q_{h} C_{in} = (Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}) C_{out} $$\nThis equation allows us to find the ratio of outflow to inflow concentration:\n$$ \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = \\frac{Q_{h}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}} $$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the hepatic extraction ratio, $E$. The extraction ratio is the fraction of drug removed from the blood during its transit through the liver. It is defined as:\n$$ E = \\frac{\\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out}}{\\text{Rate In}} = \\frac{Q_{h} C_{in} - Q_{h} C_{out}}{Q_{h} C_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for the concentration ratio $\\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}$:\n$$ E = 1 - \\frac{Q_{h}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}} = \\frac{(Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}) - Q_{h}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}} $$\n\nNow, we derive the expression for hepatic clearance, $CL_{h}$. Clearance is defined as the volume of blood cleared of drug per unit time, and it is the proportionality constant between the rate of elimination and the inflowing drug concentration, $C_{in}$:\n$$ R_{el} = CL_{h} C_{in} $$\nFrom the mass balance, we also know that $R_{el} = Q_{h} C_{in} - Q_{h} C_{out} = Q_{h} (C_{in} - C_{out})$.

In pharmacokinetics, drugs are generally classified as:\n- Low-extraction if $E  0.3$\n- Intermediate-extraction if $0.3 \\le E \\le 0.7$\n- High-extraction if $E  0.7$\n\nSince $E = 0.2500  0.3$, this drug is classified as a low-extraction drug. The clearance of low-extraction drugs is primarily determined by the intrinsic clearing capacity of the liver and the fraction of unbound drug ($CL_{h} \\approx f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}$), rather than by the blood flow rate. Therefore, the drug is categorized as **capacity-limited**. This is consistent with our values: $CL_{h} = 22.50$ L/h is close to $f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int},h} = 30$ L/h and much smaller than $Q_{h} = 90$ L/h.\n\nThe requested numerical answers are the hepatic clearance $CL_{h}$ and the extraction ratio $E$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 22.50  0.2500 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5045723"}, {"introduction": "Beyond elimination, a PBPK model must describe how a drug distributes throughout the body's tissues, which is essential for predicting efficacy and toxicity.

The rate of change of the amount of drug in the tissue, $\\frac{dA_t}{dt}$, is equal to the rate at which the drug enters the tissue minus the rate at which it leaves.\n\n$$\n\\frac{dA_t}{dt} = \\text{Rate of drug in} - \\text{Rate of drug out}\n$$\n\nThe drug enters the tissue via arterial blood at a flow rate of $Q_t$ and concentration $C_a$. The rate of drug entry is the product of flow and concentration:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of drug in} = Q_t C_a\n$$\n\nThe drug leaves the tissue via venous blood at the same flow rate $Q_t$ but with a different concentration, the venous concentration $C_v$. The rate of drug exit is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of drug out} = Q_t C_v\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_t}{dt} = Q_t C_a - Q_t C_v = Q_t (C_a - C_v)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for an equation for the rate of change of tissue concentration, $\\frac{dC_t}{dt}$. We must express $\\frac{dA_t}{dt}$ and $C_v$ in terms of the desired variables.\n\nFirst, the amount of drug in the tissue, $A_t$, is defined as the product of the tissue volume, $V_t$, and the tissue concentration, $C_t$:\n$$\nA_t = V_t C_t\n$$\nAssuming the tissue volume $V_t$ is constant, we can differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_t}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(V_t C_t) = V_t \\frac{dC_t}{dt}\n$$\n\nSecond, the perfusion-limited model assumes instantaneous equilibrium between the tissue and the blood leaving it. This relationship is given by the tissue:blood partition coefficient, $K_{p,t}$:\n$$\nC_t = K_{p,t} C_v\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the venous concentration $C_v$ in terms of the tissue concentration $C_t$:\n$$\nC_v = \\frac{C_t}{K_{p,t}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\frac{dA_t}{dt}$ and $C_v$ into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nV_t \\frac{dC_t}{dt} = Q_t \\left( C_a - \\frac{C_t}{K_{p,t}} \\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, to obtain the ODE for $\\frac{dC_t}{dt}$, we divide both sides by $V_t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_t}{dt} = \\frac{Q_t}{V_t} \\left( C_a - \\frac{C_t}{K_{p,t}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required ordinary differential equation for the rate of change of tissue concentration.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate this rate of change at a specific moment using the provided parameter values:\n- $V_t = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n- $Q_t = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{L\\,min^{-1}}$\n- $K_{p,t} = 5$\n- $C_a = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}$\n- $C_t = 1\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_t}{dt} = \\frac{0.3\\,\\mathrm{L\\,min^{-1}}}{1.5\\,\\mathrm{L}} \\left( 2\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}} - \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}}{5} \\right)\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms inside and outside the parentheses:\n$$\n\\frac{0.3}{1.5} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n2 - \\frac{1}{5} = 2 - 0.2 = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}\n$$\n\nNow, we multiply these results to find the rate of change:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_t}{dt} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}} \\times 1.8\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}} = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}\\,min^{-1}}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Elimination is exclusively hepatic.\n\n**1. Hepatic Extraction Ratio ($E$)**\n\nThe hepatic extraction ratio, $E$, is the fraction of a drug that is eliminated from the blood during a single pass through the liver. We derive its expression from the principle of mass conservation.\n\nThe rate of drug entering the liver is the product of hepatic blood flow, $Q_h$, and the concentration of the drug in the blood entering the liver, $C_{in}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate In} = Q_h C_{in}\n$$\nThe rate of drug leaving the liver is the product of hepatic blood flow and the concentration in the blood exiting the liver, $C_{out}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate Out} = Q_h C_{out}\n$$\nThe rate of elimination in the liver, $v_{el}$, is the difference between the rate in and the rate out.\n$$\nv_{el} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out} = Q_h (C_{in} - C_{out})\n$$\nBy definition, the hepatic clearance, $Cl_h$, is the rate of elimination divided by the concentration of drug presented to the organ, $C_{in}$.\n$$\nCl_h = \\frac{v_{el}}{C_{in}} = \\frac{Q_h (C_{in} - C_{out})}{C_{in}} = Q_h \\left(1 - \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}\\right)\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the hepatic extraction ratio, $E$.\n$$\nE = \\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}}\n$$\nThus, hepatic clearance is related to a more fundamental property, $E$, by $Cl_h = Q_h E$.\n\nTo relate $E$ to the liver's metabolic capacity, we use the perfusion-limited model assumption. This model posits that the drug concentration within the liver equilibrates rapidly and is uniform, being equal to the concentration in the exiting venous blood, $C_{out}$. The rate of elimination is governed by first-order kinetics, proportional to the unbound drug concentration in the liver. The proportionality constant is the intrinsic clearance, $Cl_{int}$.\n$$\nv_{el} = Cl_{int} \\cdot C_{u,liver}\n$$\nwhere $C_{u,liver}$ is the unbound drug concentration in the liver. Under the well-stirred assumption, $C_{u,liver}$ is equal to the unbound concentration in the exiting blood, $fu_p C_{out}$, where $fu_p$ is the unbound fraction in plasma (and blood, as per the problem statement).\n$$\nv_{el} = Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p \\cdot C_{out}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $v_{el}$:\n$$\nQ_h (C_{in} - C_{out}) = Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p \\cdot C_{out}\n$$\nWe solve for the ratio $C_{out}/C_{in}$:\n$$\nQ_h C_{in} = (Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p) C_{out}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = \\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p}\n$$\nSubstituting this ratio back into the definition of $E$:\n$$\nE = 1 - \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p} = \\frac{(Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p) - Q_h}{Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the hepatic extraction ratio:\n$$\nE = \\frac{Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p}{Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p}\n$$\nThis equation shows that $E$ is determined by the interplay between blood flow ($Q_h$) and the liver's intrinsic metabolic ability, represented by the product of intrinsic clearance ($Cl_{int}$) and the unbound fraction ($fu_p$).\n\n**2. Systemic Exposure (Area Under the Curve, $AUC$)**\n\nTotal systemic clearance, $Cl_{sys}$, is the sum of all organ clearances. As the problem states that hepatic elimination is the sole pathway, $Cl_{sys}$ is equal to $Cl_h$.\n$$\nCl_{sys} = Cl_h = Q_h \\cdot E = Q_h \\left( \\frac{Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p}{Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p} \\right)\n$$\nThe area under the concentration-time curve from time $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$, denoted $AUC$, represents the total systemic exposure to the drug. For any drug that exhibits linear kinetics (i.e., clearance is constant), the total clearance is fundamentally related to the administered dose, $D$, and the resulting $AUC$. The total amount of drug eliminated from the body over all time must equal the bioavailable dose. For an IV bolus, the entire dose $D$ is bioavailable.\nThe total amount eliminated is the integral of the rate of elimination over time:\n$$\n\\text{Amount Eliminated} = \\int_0^\\infty v_{el,sys}(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty (Cl_{sys} \\cdot C(t)) dt\n$$\nSince $Cl_{sys}$ is constant:\n$$\n\\text{Amount Eliminated} = Cl_{sys} \\int_0^\\infty C(t) dt = Cl_{sys} \\cdot AUC\n$$\nEquating the amount eliminated to the dose:\n$$\nD = Cl_{sys} \\cdot AUC\n$$\nRearranging for $AUC$:\n$$\nAUC = \\frac{D}{Cl_{sys}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Cl_{sys}$:\n$$\nAUC = \\frac{D}{Q_h \\left( \\frac{Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p}{Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p} \\right)} = \\frac{D(Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p)}{Q_h \\cdot Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p}\n$$\nThe volume of the central compartment, $V_c$, is not required for calculating $E$ or the total $AUC$. It determines the initial concentration $C(0) = D/V_c$ and the elimination rate constant $k_e = Cl_{sys}/V_c$, which define the profile $C(t) = C(0)e^{-k_et}$, but the integral of this profile, $AUC$, depends only on $D$ and $Cl_{sys}$.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation for Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe algorithm will compute $E$ and $AUC$ for each test case under three conditions for the unbound fraction in plasma ($fu_p$).\n\nFor each test case with parameters $Q_h, Cl_{int}, fu_p, V_c, D$:\n\n1.  **Define a calculation function**: Create a function `compute_pk(Q_h, Cl_int, fu_p, D)` that implements the derived formulas:\n    -   Calculate $E = (Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p) / (Q_h + Cl_{int} \\cdot fu_p)$.\n    -   Calculate $Cl_{sys} = Q_h \\cdot E$.\n    -   If $Cl_{sys}$ is zero (which could happen if $fu_p$ or $Cl_{int}$ is zero), the $AUC$ would be infinite. In this problem's context, $Cl_{int}$ and $fu_p$ are positive, so this is not a concern.\n    -   Calculate $AUC = D / Cl_{sys}$.\n    -   Return $E$ and $AUC$.\n\n2.  **Baseline Calculation**:\n    -   Let $fu_{p,base}$ be the provided value of $fu_p$.\n    -   Call `compute_pk` with $fu_{p,base}$ to get $E_{base}$ and $AUC_{base}$.\n\n3.  **Low $fu_p$ Scenario**:\n    -   Calculate $fu_p^{\\text{low}} = 0.5 \\cdot fu_{p,base}$.\n    -   Call `compute_pk` with $fu_p^{\\text{low}}$ to get $E_{low}$ and $AUC_{low}$.\n\n4.  **High $fu_p$ Scenario**:\n    -   Calculate $fu_p^{\\text{high, temp}} = 1.5 \\cdot fu_{p,base}$.\n    -   Apply the constraint that the unbound fraction cannot exceed $1$: $fu_p^{\\text{high}} = \\min(fu_p^{\\text{high, temp}}, 1.0)$.\n    -   Call `compute_pk` with $fu_p^{\\text{high}}$ to get $E_{high}$ and $AUC_{high}$.\n\n5.  **Output Formatting**:\n    -   Collect the six calculated values: $E_{base}, E_{low}, E_{high}, AUC_{base}, AUC_{low}, AUC_{high}$.\n    -   Round each value to six decimal places.\n    -   Format them into a string as `\"[val1,val2,val3,val4,val5,val6]\"`.\n    -   Concatenate the formatted strings for all test cases, separated by commas, and enclose the entire result in square brackets.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the output is based on a rigorous derivation from first principles and adheres to all specifications of the problem.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the PBPK sensitivity analysis problem.\n    The function iterates through a set of test cases, calculates pharmacokinetic\n    parameters (hepatic extraction ratio E and systemic exposure AUC) based on\n    a perfusion-limited liver model, and performs a sensitivity analysis on the\n    unbound fraction in plasma (fu_p).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Test cases defined as tuples: (Q_h, Cl_int, fu_p, V_c, D)\n    # Q_h: Hepatic blood flow (L/h)\n    # Cl_int: Intrinsic clearance (L/h)\n    # fu_p: Unbound fraction in plasma (unitless)\n    # V_c: Central volume of distribution (L) -
