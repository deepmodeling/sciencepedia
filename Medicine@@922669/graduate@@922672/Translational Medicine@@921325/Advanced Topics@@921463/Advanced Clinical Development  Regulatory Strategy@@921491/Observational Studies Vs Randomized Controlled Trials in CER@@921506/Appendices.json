The use of an RCT, the difference-in-means estimator for the average treatment effect (ATE), the Central Limit Theorem for large-sample inference, and the construction of confidence intervals are all standard, valid methodologies.

It satisfies all criteria for validity. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to estimate the average treatment effect, $\\Delta = \\mathbb{E}[Y\\mid A=1]-\\mathbb{E}[Y\\mid A=0]$. Based on the principles of randomized trials, the difference-in-means estimator, $\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{Y}_{1} - \\bar{Y}_{0}$, is an unbiased estimator for $\\Delta$. We are tasked with deriving its standard error and constructing a $95\\%$ confidence interval.\n\nFirst, we calculate the point estimate of the average treatment effect:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{Y}_{1} - \\bar{Y}_{0} = 0.25 - 0.32 = -0.07\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the standard error of this estimator. The variance of the estimator is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{1} - \\bar{Y}_{0})$. Because the two treatment groups are formed by randomization, they are independent. The variance of a difference of two independent random variables is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{1}) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{0})\n$$\nThe variance of a sample mean $\\bar{Y}$ from a sample of size $n$ drawn from a population with variance $\\sigma^2$ is given by $\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}) = \\sigma^2/n$. Let $\\sigma_1^2$ and $\\sigma_0^2$ be the true population variances of the outcome in each treatment arm. Then:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{1}) = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{0}) = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{n_0}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the within-arm outcome variance can be approximated by a common value $s^2 = 0.09$. We use this value as an estimate for both $\\sigma_1^2$ and $\\sigma_0^2$. Thus, the estimated variance of $\\hat{\\Delta}$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\frac{s^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2}{n_0}\n$$\nThe standard error (SE) is the square root of the estimated variance:\n$$\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2}{n_0}}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the standard error formula.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the standard error using the given data: $n_1=500$, $n_0=500$, and $s^2=0.09$.\n$$\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.09}{500} + \\frac{0.09}{500}} = \\sqrt{2 \\times \\frac{0.09}{500}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.18}{500}} = \\sqrt{0.00036}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta}) \\approx 0.01897366...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the standard error is $0.01897$.\n\nTo construct the $95\\%$ confidence interval, we rely on the Central Limit Theorem. Given the large sample sizes ($n_1=500, n_0=500$), the sampling distribution of the estimator $\\hat{\\Delta}$ is approximately normal, with mean $\\Delta$ and standard deviation equal to $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta})$. A two-sided $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for $\\Delta$ is given by:\n$$\n\\text{CI} = \\hat{\\Delta} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta})\n$$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$. The critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nThe margin of error (ME) is:\n$$\n\\text{ME} = z_{0.975} \\times \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta}) \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.01897366... \\approx 0.03718838...\n$$\nThe confidence interval is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{CI} = -0.07 \\pm 0.03718838...\n$$\nThe lower endpoint of the confidence interval is:\n$$\nL = -0.07 - 0.03718838... = -0.10718838...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the lower endpoint is $-0.1072$.\n\nThe upper endpoint of the confidence interval is:\n$$\nU = -0.07 + 0.03718838... = -0.03281161...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the upper endpoint is $-0.03281$.\n\nThe three requested numerical quantities are:\n1.  Standard error: $0.01897$\n2.  Lower CI endpoint: $-0.1072$\n3.
