We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $E$ be the adverse event. We are given the risk, which is the probability of this event occurring, for two groups: a treatment group ($T$) and a control group ($C$).\nThe risk in the treatment group is given as $p_T = P(E|T) = 0.20$.\nThe risk in the control group, also known as the baseline risk, is given as $p_C = P(E|C) = 0.25$.\nThe total number of eligible patients in the target population is $N = 12,345$.\n\nFirst, we derive the three key measures of effect: Risk Difference, Risk Ratio, and Odds Ratio.\n\nThe foundational definition of risk is the probability of an event. The odds of an event is defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring.\nFor the treatment group, the odds of an event are:\n$$O_T = \\frac{P(E|T)}{P(\\neg E|T)} = \\frac{p_T}{1 - p_T}$$\nFor the control group, the odds of an event are:\n$$O_C = \\frac{P(E|C)}{P(\\neg E|C)} = \\frac{p_C}{1 - p_C}$$\n\n1.  **Risk Difference (RD)**\n    The Risk Difference, also known as Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) when the treatment reduces risk, is the arithmetic difference in risk between the control and treatment groups. It measures the absolute change in risk attributable to the treatment.\n    $$RD = p_C - p_T$$\n    Using the given values:\n    $$RD = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05$$\n\n2.  **Risk Ratio (RR)**\n    The Risk Ratio, also known as the Relative Risk, is the ratio of the risk in the treatment group to the risk in the control group. It measures the multiplicative change in risk.\n    $$RR = \\frac{p_T}{p_C}$$\n    Using the given values:\n    $$RR = \\frac{0.20}{0.25} = 0.80$$\n\n3.  **Odds Ratio (OR)**\n    The Odds Ratio is the ratio of the odds of the event in the treatment group to the odds of the event in the control group.\n    $$OR = \\frac{O_T}{O_C} = \\frac{p_T / (1 - p_T)}{p_C / (1 - p_C)}$$\n    Using the given values:\n    $$p_T = 0.20 \\implies 1-p_T = 0.80$$\n    $$p_C = 0.25 \\implies 1-p_C = 0.75$$\n    Substituting these into the formula for OR:\n    $$OR = \\frac{0.20 / 0.80}{0.25 / 0.75} = \\frac{0.25}{1/3} = 0.25 \\times 3 = 0.75$$\n\nNext, we articulate how these measures may differentially inform policy under CER.\nIn the context of CER, the goal is to guide real-world healthcare decisions, including policy and large-scale resource allocation.\nThe **Risk Difference (RD)**, or Absolute Risk Reduction, is often the most useful measure for policy. In this case, $RD = 0.05$. This means that for every 100 people who receive the treatment instead of the control, 5 adverse events are prevented. The reciprocal, $1/RD = 1/0.05 = 20$, is the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), indicating that 20 patients must be treated to prevent one additional adverse event. RD is directly translatable to population-level impact, making it invaluable for health economic appraisals and resource planning. However, RD is highly dependent on the baseline risk ($p_C$); an effective treatment will yield a small RD if the baseline risk is very low.\nThe **Risk Ratio (RR)** of 0.80 indicates that the risk of the event in the treated group is 80% of the risk in the control group, which corresponds to a relative risk reduction of $1 - RR = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$, or 20%. The RR is often more stable across populations with varying baseline risks than the RD. This makes it useful for generalizing the relative efficacy of an intervention. However, for policy decisions, a large RR can be misleading if the absolute risk is small. A 20% risk reduction is more impactful when the baseline risk is 25% than when it is 0.1%.\nThe **Odds Ratio (OR)** of 0.75 means the odds of an adverse event are 25% lower in the treatment group compared to the control group. The OR is a fundamental parameter in many statistical models (e.g., logistic regression) and has desirable mathematical properties. However, its interpretation is less intuitive than that of RR or RD, making it a weaker tool for communicating with policymakers or the public. When the event is not rare, as in this case where $p_C = 0.25$, the OR exaggerates the effect compared to the RR ($OR = 0.75  RR = 0.80$). For policy, its primary value is indirect, through its role in the statistical analyses that generate evidence.\nIn summary, for scaling an intervention, RD provides the most direct estimate of public health impact, while RR helps in assessing the relative magnitude of the effect, and OR serves primarily as a statistical measure.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected number of adverse events that would be prevented in the target population of $N=12,345$ patients.\nThe expected number of events is the product of the number of individuals and their risk of the event.\nExpected number of events if all patients receive the control:\n$$E_C = N \\times p_C = 12,345 \\times 0.25$$\nExpected number of events if all patients receive the treatment:\n$$E_T = N \\times p_T = 12,345 \\times 0.20$$\nThe expected number of events prevented, $\\Delta E$, is the difference between these two expected counts:\n$$\\Delta E = E_C - E_T = (N \\times p_C) - (N \\times p_T) = N \\times (p_C - p_T)$$\nThis is equivalent to multiplying the population size by the Risk Difference (RD):\n$$\\Delta E = N \\times RD$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Delta E = 12,345 \\times (0.25 - 0.20) = 12,345 \\times 0.05 = 617.25$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final numeric answer to four significant figures. The number 617.25 rounded to four significant figures is 617.3.\nThus, rolling out the treatment to the entire eligible population is expected to prevent approximately 617.3 adverse events.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{617.3}$$", "id": "5050291"}, {"introduction": "While randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for causal inference, much of comparative effectiveness research relies on observational data.

We are given the necessary assumptions and data to proceed with this calculation.\n\nLet $Y$ be the patient-level binary outcome, where $Y=1$ if a patient experiences a serious adverse drug event and $Y=0$ otherwise. The mean of $Y$ within any group represents the absolute risk for that group.\nLet $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be a time-invariant indicator for the treatment group, where $D=1$ for hospitals that adopt the new tool (the treated group) and $D=0$ for hospitals that do not (the control group).\nLet $t \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be the time period indicator, where $t=0$ is the pre-adoption period and $t=1$ is the post-adoption period.\n\nThe problem provides the following sample mean risks, which are the empirical estimates of the conditional expected values $E[Y|D, t]$:\n- Mean risk for the treated group in the pre-adoption period: $\\bar{Y}_{D=1, t=0} = 0.25$\n- Mean risk for the treated group in the post-adoption period: $\\bar{Y}_{D=1, t=1} = 0.18$\n- Mean risk for the control group in the pre-adoption period: $\\bar{Y}_{D=0, t=0} = 0.20$\n- Mean risk for the control group in the post-adoption period: $\\bar{Y}_{D=0, t=1} = 0.19$\n\nThe causal parameter of interest is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) in the post-adoption period. In the potential outcomes framework, we define $Y_1(1)$ as the potential outcome for a patient in a treated hospital ($D=1$) under treatment (in period $t=1$), and $Y_0(1)$ as the potential outcome for the same patient in the same hospital and period had the treatment not been administered. The ATT is the expected difference between these two potential outcomes for the treated group:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = E[Y_1(1) - Y_0(1) | D=1]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, this is:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = E[Y_1(1) | D=1] - E[Y_0(1) | D=1]\n$$\nThe first term, $E[Y_1(1) | D=1]$, is the expected outcome for the treated group, given they are treated. This is factually observed in the data for the post-adoption period. Its sample analog is $\\bar{Y}_{D=1, t=1} = 0.18$.\n\nThe second term, $E[Y_0(1) | D=1]$, is the counterfactual expected outcome: what would have been the risk in the treated-group hospitals in the post-adoption period if they had *not* adopted the tool. This quantity is not observed.\n\nThe key to the DiD method is to estimate this counterfactual using the \"parallel trends\" assumption. This assumption states that, in the absence of treatment, the average change in the outcome for the treated group would have been the same as the average change in the outcome for the control group. Mathematically:\n$$\nE[Y_0(1) | D=1] - E[Y_0(0) | D=1] = E[Y_0(1) | D=0] - E[Y_0(0) | D=0]\n$$\nIn the pre-adoption period ($t=0$), no group is treated, so the potential outcome without treatment, $Y_0(0)$, is the same as the observed outcome $Y(0)$. Also, the control group is never treated, so for them $Y_0(1) = Y(1)$. Therefore, we can rewrite the assumption using observed quantities:\n$$\nE[Y_0(1) | D=1] - E[Y | D=1, t=0] = E[Y | D=0, t=1] - E[Y | D=0, t=0]\n$$\nSolving for the unobserved counterfactual, $E[Y_0(1) | D=1]$:\n$$\nE[Y_0(1) | D=1] = E[Y | D=1, t=0] + (E[Y | D=0, t=1] - E[Y | D=0, t=0])\n$$\nThis expression states that the counterfactual risk for the treated group is their baseline risk plus the change experienced by the control group over the same period.\n\nNow we substitute this expression for the counterfactual back into the equation for the ATT:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = E[Y | D=1, t=1] - \\left( E[Y | D=1, t=0] + E[Y | D=0, t=1] - E[Y | D=0, t=0] \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives the standard DiD formula:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = (E[Y | D=1, t=1] - E[Y | D=1, t=0]) - (E[Y | D=0, t=1] - E[Y | D=0, t=0])\n$$\nThe DiD estimator, $\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD}$, is the sample analog of this expression. We plug in the provided sample means:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD} = (\\bar{Y}_{D=1, t=1} - \\bar{Y}_{D=1, t=0}) - (\\bar{Y}_{D=0, t=1} - \\bar{Y}_{D=0, t=0})\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD} = (0.18 - 0.25) - (0.19 - 0.20)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the change in risk for the treated group:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{treated}} = 0.18 - 0.25 = -0.07\n$$\nNext, calculate the change in risk for the control group. This represents the secular trend in risk that is unrelated to the intervention.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{control}} = 0.19 - 0.20 = -0.01\n$$\nThe DiD estimate is the difference between these two changes:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD} = \\Delta_{\\text{treated}} - \\Delta_{\\text{control}} = -0.07 - (-0.01)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD} = -0.07 + 0.01 = -0.06\n$$\nThis result, $-0.06$, is the estimated causal effect of the clinical decision support tool. It indicates that the tool caused a 6 percentage point reduction in the absolute risk of the adverse drug event for a patient in the treated hospitals, after accounting for the background trend in risk observed in the control hospitals.

It presents a standard task in the field of causal inference and epidemiology: the calculation of an E-value for a given observed risk ratio.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an analytic expression for the Evidence value (E-value) and its computation for an observed Risk Ratio, $RR_{\\text{obs}}$, of $0.75$. The E-value quantifies the required strength of association an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away an observed association.\n\nLet $A$ denote the treatment variable ($A=1$ for treatment $A$, $A=0$ for comparator $B$), and let $Y$ be the binary clinical outcome ($Y=1$ for an event). The observed risk ratio, adjusted for measured covariates, is given as $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 0.75$. This is the ratio of the probability of the outcome in the treated group to that in the comparator group:\n$$ RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{P(Y=1|A=1, C=c)}{P(Y=1|A=0, C=c)} $$\nwhere $C$ represents the set of measured covariates. For notational simplicity, we will omit $C$ as all associations are defined conditional upon it.\n\nThe relationship between the observed risk ratio ($RR_{\\text{obs}}$), the true causal risk ratio ($RR_{\\text{true}}$), and the bias factor ($B$) due to unmeasured confounding is given by $RR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\times B$. To \"fully explain away\" the observed association means that the true causal effect is null, i.e., $RR_{\\text{true}} = 1$. In this scenario, the observed association is entirely an artifact of confounding, meaning $RR_{\\text{obs}} = B$.\n\nThe given risk ratio is $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 0.75$, which is less than $1$. The E-value framework is typically applied to risk ratios greater than $1$. For a protective association ($RR  1$), we consider its inverse, which represents the same strength of association but in the opposite direction. Let us define $RR'_{\\text{obs}} = 1 / RR_{\\text{obs}}$.\n$$ RR'_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{1}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3/4} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\nOur task is now to find the E-value that could explain away an observed risk ratio of $RR'_{\\text{obs}} = 4/3$. This requires a bias factor of $B = 4/3$.\n\nThe E-value definition is based on a standard bound for the bias factor. For an unmeasured confounder $U$ (assumed, without loss of generality, to be a risk factor for the outcome), let $RR_{AU}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the treatment $A$ and the confounder $U$, and let $RR_{UY}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder $U$ and the outcome $Y$. For the bias factor $B$ to be greater than $1$, both $RR_{AU}$ and $RR_{UY}$ must be greater than $1$. The bias factor is bounded by the expression:\n$$ B \\le \\frac{RR_{AU} \\cdot RR_{UY}}{RR_{AU} + RR_{UY} - 1} $$\nThe E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, $E$, that the confounder must have with both treatment and outcome. The problem specifies assuming this strength is equal for tractability, so we set $RR_{AU} = RR_{UY} = E$. Substituting this into the inequality gives the maximum possible bias for a given strength $E$:\n$$ B \\le \\frac{E \\cdot E}{E + E - 1} = \\frac{E^2}{2E - 1} $$\nTo explain away the observed effect $RR'_{\\text{obs}}$, the bias factor $B$ must be at least $RR'_{\\text{obs}}$. This requires that the confounder parameters be strong enough to satisfy:\n$$ RR'_{\\text{obs}} \\le \\frac{E^2}{2E - 1} $$\nThe E-value is the minimum value of $E$ for which this inequality holds. To find this minimum, we solve for the boundary case where equality holds:\n$$ RR'_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{E^2}{2E - 1} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged into a quadratic equation in terms of $E$:\n$$ RR'_{\\text{obs}}(2E - 1) = E^2 $$\n$$ 2E \\cdot RR'_{\\text{obs}} - RR'_{\\text{obs}} = E^2 $$\n$$ E^2 - 2E \\cdot RR'_{\\text{obs}} + RR'_{\\text{obs}} = 0 $$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $E$ using the quadratic formula, $E = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-2 \\cdot RR'_{\\text{obs}}$, and $c=RR'_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$ E = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR'_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{(-2 \\cdot RR'_{\\text{obs}})^2 - 4(1)(RR'_{\\text{obs}})}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR'_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{4 (RR'_{\\text{obs}})^2 - 4 RR'_{\\text{obs}}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR'_{\\text{obs}} \\pm 2 \\sqrt{(RR'_{\\text{obs}})^2 - RR'_{\\text{obs}}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = RR'_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{RR'_{\\text{obs}}(RR'_{\\text{obs}} - 1)} $$\nThis yields two potential solutions for $E$. However, the bias factor bound used is valid for confounders that are risk factors for both exposure and outcome, meaning $E = RR_{AU} = RR_{UY} > 1$. We must determine which of the two roots satisfies this condition. For any $RR'_{\\text{obs}} > 1$, it can be shown that the smaller root, $E_{-} = RR'_{\\text{obs}} - \\sqrt{RR'_{\\text{obs}}(RR'_{\\text{obs}} - 1)}$, is always less than $1$. Thus, it is not a valid solution in this context. The larger root, $E_{+} = RR'_{\\text{obs}} + \\sqrt{RR'_{\\text{obs}}(RR'_{\\text{obs}} - 1)}$, is always greater than $RR'_{\\text{obs}}$, and therefore greater than $1$. This larger root is the correct analytic expression for the E-value for an arbitrary observed risk ratio $RR > 1$:\n$$ E\\text{-value} = RR + \\sqrt{RR(RR-1)} $$\nFor the specific case of $RR_{\\text{obs}}=0.75$, we use $RR'_{\\text{obs}} = 4/3$.

This means that to fully explain away the observed protective effect of $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 0.75$, an unmeasured confounder must be associated with both the treatment and the outcome with a risk ratio of at least $2$, conditional on the measured covariates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "5050212"}]}
