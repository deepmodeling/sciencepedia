## Introduction
Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs)—encompassing gene therapies, somatic cell therapies, and tissue-engineered products—represent a paradigm shift in medicine, offering transformative potential for diseases previously considered untreatable. However, their inherent complexity, biological activity, and novelty present unique challenges that fall outside the scope of traditional pharmaceutical regulation. This gap necessitates specialized regulatory frameworks designed to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of these living, often patient-specific, therapies while facilitating timely patient access. This article provides a comprehensive guide to navigating these intricate regulatory landscapes.

This article is structured to build your expertise progressively. The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," will establish the foundational knowledge by dissecting the core regulatory principles. You will learn how ATMPs are classified in the EU and US, understand the critical concepts of Quality-by-Design (QbD) and potency testing, and explore the essential nonclinical studies required to establish a safety profile. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" bridges theory with practice, illustrating how these principles are applied in real-world scenarios, from designing clinical trials for rare diseases to navigating global development strategies and addressing the ethical and legal dimensions of these therapies. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will allow you to solidify your understanding by tackling practical problems in product classification, viral safety calculation, and statistical analysis for manufacturing changes.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Foundational Classification of Advanced Therapies

The regulatory frameworks governing Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) are built upon a foundational understanding that these therapies, by their very nature, present novel challenges in manufacturing, quality control, biological activity, and long-term safety. Classification is therefore the first and most critical step in defining the regulatory pathway. This classification is not arbitrary but is derived from first principles related to the product's composition, its degree of manipulation, and its intended biological function in the recipient. Both the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) have developed sophisticated, risk-based systems for this purpose.

#### The European Union Framework: Defining the ATMP Universe

In the European Union, the legal basis for ATMPs is established by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007. This regulation categorizes ATMPs into three main types: **Gene Therapy Medicinal Products (GTMPs)**, **Somatic Cell Therapy Medicinal Products (sCTMPs)**, and **Tissue-Engineered Products (TEPs)**. A product that does not meet the criteria for one of these categories may be a conventional biological medicinal product, such as a monoclonal antibody, even if produced using biotechnology, and would not be regulated as an ATMP [@problem_id:4988846].

The distinction between a simple cell transplantation and a regulated sCTMP or TEP hinges on the concept of whether the cells or tissues have been **"engineered"**. According to Directive 2001/83/EC, cells or tissues are considered engineered if they meet at least one of two criteria: they have been subject to **substantial manipulation**, or they are intended for a **non-homologous use** in the recipient.

**Substantial manipulation** refers to processing that alters the biological characteristics, physiological functions, or structural properties of the cells or tissues relevant to their intended clinical use. Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 clarifies that procedures such as cell selection, purification, [cryopreservation](@entry_id:173046), and centrifugation are generally *not* considered substantial. In contrast, processes like *ex vivo* culture for expansion or differentiation are classic examples of substantial manipulation. For instance, autologous hematopoietic stem cells that are merely isolated by density gradient separation and cryopreserved for hematopoietic reconstitution are not substantially manipulated and are used for their natural function (homologous use); they are therefore not considered an ATMP. However, autologous keratinocytes expanded in culture to form a sheet for treating burn wounds have been substantially manipulated and would fall under the ATMP framework [@problem_id:4988846].

**Non-homologous use** means the cells or tissues are not intended to perform the same essential function(s) in the recipient as they do in the donor. The classification thus depends not only on the product itself but also on its intended clinical application.

Once a product is determined to contain "engineered" cells or tissues, the distinction between an sCTMP and a TEP depends on its primary mode of action.
- A **Somatic Cell Therapy Medicinal Product (sCTMP)** is intended to treat, prevent, or diagnose a disease through a pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic action. A prime example is a [dendritic cell](@entry_id:191381) vaccine, where autologous dendritic cells are differentiated and activated *ex vivo* and pulsed with tumor antigens to elicit an anti-tumor immune response [@problem_id:4988846].
- A **Tissue-Engineered Product (TEP)** is specifically intended to regenerate, repair, or replace a human tissue. The aforementioned cultured [keratinocyte](@entry_id:271511) sheet, used to restore the structure of the skin, is a classic TEP [@problem_id:4988846].

A **Gene Therapy Medicinal Product (GTMP)** is defined separately as a biological medicinal product containing a recombinant nucleic acid, administered to regulate, repair, replace, add, or delete a genetic sequence. The therapeutic effect is directly linked to this nucleic acid sequence. The most prominent modern examples are [chimeric antigen receptor](@entry_id:194090) (CAR) T-cell therapies, where autologous T-cells are genetically modified *ex vivo* to express a CAR that targets cancer cells. It is crucial to note that vaccines against infectious diseases are explicitly excluded from the GTMP definition [@problem_id:4988846].

#### The United States Framework: A Risk-Based Approach to HCT/Ps

In the United States, Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a tiered, risk-based framework. The central question is whether a product can be regulated solely under **Section 361** of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act and 21 CFR Part 1271, or if it is subject to the more stringent requirements for drugs and biologics under **Section 351** of the PHS Act, which necessitates an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and a Biologics License Application (BLA).

To qualify for the less burdensome Section 361 pathway, an HCT/P must meet all criteria outlined in 21 CFR 1271.10(a). Two of the most critical criteria are that the product is no more than **minimally manipulated** and is intended for **homologous use** only [@problem_id:4988861].

**Minimal manipulation** has a definition that depends on the tissue type. For structural tissues (e.g., bone, skin, amniotic membrane), processing is minimal if it does not alter the tissue's original relevant characteristics related to its utility for reconstruction, repair, or replacement. For cells or nonstructural tissues (e.g., bone marrow), processing is minimal if it does not alter the relevant biological characteristics of the cells.
- *Example of minimal manipulation*: An amniotic membrane that is simply rinsed, cut to size, and stored in an [isotonic solution](@entry_id:143722) for use as a protective ocular covering maintains its native structural function and is thus minimally manipulated [@problem_id:4988861]. Similarly, processing bone marrow aspirate by [centrifugation](@entry_id:199699) to concentrate cells for hematopoietic reconstitution is considered minimal manipulation.
- *Example of more than minimal manipulation*: Subjecting adipose tissue to enzymatic digestion with collagenase to isolate a stromal vascular fraction fundamentally alters the original structural characteristics of the adipose tissue. This is more than minimal manipulation and would subject the product to Section 351 regulation [@problem_id:4988861].

**Homologous use** means the HCT/P performs the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor.
- *Example of homologous use*: Using bone marrow aspirate to reconstitute the blood-forming system is the quintessential homologous use [@problem_id:4988861]. Using an amniotic membrane as a barrier covering on the eye is also homologous to its natural barrier function.
- *Example of non-homologous use*: Administering a cell fraction isolated from adipose tissue intravenously to achieve systemic [immunomodulation](@entry_id:192782) for an [autoimmune disease](@entry_id:142031) is a non-homologous use, as this is not the basic function of adipose tissue in its native location. Likewise, injecting micronized placental tissue into a joint for its anti-inflammatory effects is not a basic function of the placenta and constitutes non-homologous use [@problem_id:4988861].

If an HCT/P is more than minimally manipulated, is intended for a non-homologous use, or fails other criteria in 21 CFR 1271.10(a) (e.g., has systemic effects), it is regulated as a drug/biologic under Section 351, requiring extensive premarket review to ensure its safety and effectiveness.

#### Combined Advanced Therapies

A special category exists for products that integrate medicinal and device components. A **combined ATMP** is an ATMP that incorporates, as an integral part, one or more medical devices. For a product to be regulated as a single combined ATMP, the cellular or tissue part must provide the **primary intended action**, with the device part being ancillary. A classic example is autologous [chondrocytes](@entry_id:262831) expanded *ex vivo* and seeded onto a biodegradable scaffold for cartilage repair. The cells (a TEP) provide the primary regenerative action, while the scaffold (a medical device) serves the ancillary function of providing a temporary structure and localizing the cells. Such a product would be regulated as a combined ATMP [@problem_id:4988846] [@problem_id:4988829]. The regulatory implications for the device component are significant and are discussed later in this chapter.

### The Core Principle of Quality: From Mechanism of Action to Lot Release

Once an ATMP is classified, the focus shifts to ensuring its quality, safety, and efficacy. The principles of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) for ATMPs are fundamentally different from those for conventional chemical drugs or even traditional biologics like monoclonal antibodies. The distinction arises because the ATMP itself is often a living, heterogeneous, and patient-specific product.

#### Defining Quality for a Living Drug

A conventional biologic, such as a [monoclonal antibody](@entry_id:192080) (mAb), is a well-defined molecular entity. Its quality can be assured by confirming its [primary structure](@entry_id:144876), post-translational modifications, purity (absence of aggregates, fragments, and process impurities), and a relatively simple potency assay (e.g., target binding). Viability is not a relevant attribute for a non-living protein [@problem_id:4988821].

In stark contrast, an ATMP like an autologous CAR T-[cell therapy](@entry_id:193438) is a complex, [living drug](@entry_id:192721) product. Its quality cannot be defined by a single molecular structure but by a constellation of attributes that collectively determine its function. Donor-to-donor variability in starting material introduces a level of heterogeneity that is absent in products derived from a stable, clonal [master cell bank](@entry_id:171540). The release specifications for an ATMP must therefore account for this biological complexity. The key **Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs)** are:

- **Identity**: This confirms the product is what it purports to be. For a CAR-T product, this is a multi-faceted attribute, requiring confirmation of both the cell lineage (e.g., T-cells positive for the CD3 marker) and the presence of the therapeutic transgene (e.g., CAR expression on the cell surface), typically measured by multiparameter flow cytometry [@problem_id:4988821].

- **Purity**: This refers to the absence of unwanted components. For an ATMP, this includes both product-related impurities (e.g., non-target cell populations like residual B-cells) and process-related impurities (e.g., residual beads from activation, reagents, or viral vector components) [@problem_id:4988821].

- **Viability**: As a [living drug](@entry_id:192721), the number of viable cells administered constitutes the dose. Viability (e.g., measured by a dye-exclusion method) is therefore a critical quality attribute. A product with high potency per cell but low viability will have a low total activity. Specifications typically require a minimum percentage of viable cells (e.g., $\ge 70\%$) and define the dose as the total number of viable cells [@problem_id:4988821].

- **Safety**: This includes ensuring the product is free from microbial contamination (**sterility**), has acceptably low levels of bacterial **endotoxin**, and is free from adventitious agents like **mycoplasma**. For genetically modified products using [viral vectors](@entry_id:265848), a critical safety test is for the absence of **Replication-Competent Lentivirus (RCL)** or **Replication-Competent Adeno-associated virus (rcAAV)**, which could cause a spreading infection [@problem_id:4988821]. Another safety-related CQA is the **vector copy number (VCN)** per cell, which must be controlled to mitigate the long-term risk of [insertional mutagenesis](@entry_id:266513).

- **Potency**: This is arguably the most critical and challenging attribute for an ATMP. Potency is the quantitative measure of the product's biological activity and must be linked to its intended **Mechanism of Action (MoA)**.

#### Potency: The Keystone Attribute Reflecting Mechanism of Action

Regulatory authorities globally (including under 21 CFR in the US and ICH guidelines) mandate that the potency assay(s) for a biological product must reflect its intended MoA. For an ATMP with a complex or multifactorial MoA, this presents a significant challenge. A single assay may not be sufficient to capture the product's full biological activity [@problem_id:4988868].

Consider an engineered mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) product whose immunosuppressive MoA is multifactorial, relying on IL-10 secretion, IDO enzyme activity, and PD-L1 surface expression. A robust potency strategy for such a product would not rely on a single, simplistic measure. The types of assays can be conceptualized in a hierarchy of relevance:

1.  **Functional Bioassays**: These assays directly measure the intended biological effect. For the immunosuppressive MSC product, a **mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)**, which quantifies the inhibition of T-cell proliferation, is an ideal functional bioassay. It integrates the effects of all three MoA pathways into a single, relevant functional readout. Such assays are powerful but can be complex, lengthy, and highly variable [@problem_id:4988868].

2.  **Surrogate Assays**: These are typically simpler biochemical or phenotypic assays that measure attributes believed to contribute to the MoA. For the MSC product, these could include an ELISA for IL-10 concentration, a biochemical assay for IDO activity, and a [flow cytometry](@entry_id:197213) assay for PD-L1 expression. For these surrogates to be acceptable as part of a potency matrix for lot release, a strong, statistically-defined quantitative correlation between the surrogate attribute(s) and the outcome of the functional bioassay must be established and maintained over the product lifecycle [@problem_id:4988868]. Simply measuring the presence of a molecule like IL-10 without demonstrating its link to function is insufficient.

3.  **Multi-Attribute Assays and Composite Scores**: For mature products, especially after process changes, developers may transition from a variable bioassay to a more precise composite potency index. This involves building a mathematical model that integrates the measurements from several surrogate assays (e.g., IL-10, IDO, PD-L1 levels) to predict the result of the functional bioassay. This requires a rigorous bridging study to establish the model's predictive power (e.g., a high [coefficient of determination](@entry_id:168150), $R^2 \ge 0.90$). The functional bioassay is then retained as a characterization tool to periodically confirm that the surrogate model remains predictive, representing a sophisticated lifecycle approach to potency testing [@problem_id:4988868].

#### Quality-by-Design (QbD) as a Framework for Control

Given the inherent variability of ATMPs, particularly autologous products, the traditional approach of "testing quality in" at the final release stage is inadequate. The modern paradigm, articulated in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines Q8, Q9, and Q10, is **Quality-by-Design (QbD)**. QbD is a systematic, science- and risk-based approach to development that begins with predefined objectives and emphasizes product and process understanding and process control.

The QbD process for an ATMP, such as a CAR-T therapy, follows a logical flow [@problem_id:4988886]:
1.  **Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP)**: This defines the prospective goals for the product in terms of its clinical quality, safety, and efficacy.
2.  **Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs)**: These are the physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological attributes of the product that must be controlled within an appropriate limit to ensure the desired product quality. For a CAR-T product, CQAs are derived directly from the MoA and include viability, CAR expression density, cytotoxic potency, T-cell memory subset composition (for durability), and attributes related to safety like vector copy number [@problem_id:4988886].
3.  **Critical Process Parameters (CPPs)**: These are the process parameters whose variability has a critical impact on the CQAs. A key part of QbD is performing risk assessments and experimental studies to map the relationships between CPPs and CQAs. For a CAR-T process, CPPs may include the T-cell activation duration, the viral vector-to-cell ratio, cytokine concentrations during culture, and the [cryopreservation](@entry_id:173046) cooling rate.
4.  **Control Strategy**: This is a planned set of controls, derived from product and process understanding, that ensures process performance and product quality. For ATMPs, a sophisticated control strategy is essential to manage the high degree of input variability (e.g., from patient starting material). An effective strategy may include a defined **design space** (the multidimensional combination of CPPs demonstrated to provide [quality assurance](@entry_id:202984)), the use of **Process Analytical Technology (PAT)** for real-time or near-real-time monitoring of CQAs during manufacturing, and **feed-forward control loops** where measurements of starting material attributes are used to adjust CPPs prospectively to achieve a more consistent final product. This proactive management of variability is the hallmark of a successful QbD implementation for an ATMP [@problem_id:4988886].

### Navigating the Regulatory Pathways to Market

The unique scientific profile of ATMPs necessitates correspondingly unique regulatory pathways. These pathways are designed to accommodate the products' complexity and often address areas of high unmet medical need, balancing the imperative for timely patient access with the need for rigorous oversight.

#### The Mandate for Centralized Authorization in the EU

In the European Union, the default marketing authorization pathway for all ATMPs is the **centralized procedure**, managed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This is not an optional route; it is mandated by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007. The justification for this mandate is rooted in several first principles related to risk, novelty, and the pan-European nature of healthcare [@problem_id:4988824].

- **Concentrated Expertise**: ATMPs are scientifically and technically complex, involving novel modalities like gene editing and combination with medical devices. Individual national authorities may lack the consolidated, multidisciplinary expertise required to consistently evaluate their benefit-risk profile. The centralized procedure concentrates this expertise within the EMA's specialized committees, primarily the **Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT)** and the **Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)**. This ensures a uniform, state-of-the-art assessment for all patients in the EU [@problem_id:4988824].

- **Harmonized Quality Control**: ATMPs are often manufactured at a small number of specialized sites, potentially in different member states, for distribution across the EU. A single, centrally reviewed CMC package ensures that a harmonized standard for quality, potency, and safety is applied, mitigating the risk of inter-jurisdictional divergence in product quality [@problem_id:4988824].

- **Robust Pharmacovigilance**: Many ATMPs target rare diseases, and some of their most significant risks (e.g., secondary malignancy from [insertional mutagenesis](@entry_id:266513)) are rare and have long latency periods. Detecting such safety signals requires the aggregation of post-market data from a large number of patient-years of exposure. A fragmented, national system would result in siloed, underpowered datasets. The centralized pathway enables a single EU-wide pharmacovigilance system (e.g., through EudraVigilance) and a unified Risk Management Plan (RMP), which is essential for timely [signal detection](@entry_id:263125) and risk mitigation across the entire Union [@problem_id:4988824].

The centralized procedure itself involves a clear sequence of institutional roles. The sponsor submits a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA. The CAT, as the specialist committee, performs the primary scientific assessment and prepares a draft opinion on the ATMP's quality, safety, and efficacy. This draft opinion is then transmitted to the CHMP, which considers it and adopts the final scientific opinion for the EMA. Finally, the European Commission receives the CHMP opinion and issues the single, legally binding decision that grants marketing authorization across the entire EU [@problem_id:4988849].

#### Special Regulatory Mechanisms and Expedited Pathways

To accelerate the development and review of promising therapies for serious conditions with unmet medical needs, both the EU and US have established several expedited programs. These programs do not lower the standard for approval but provide enhanced agency interaction and/or faster review timelines [@problem_id:4988874].

In the **European Union**:
- **Priority Medicines (PRIME)**: An early support scheme for medicines that show potential for a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefit patients with no treatment options. It provides enhanced scientific and regulatory support, including the appointment of a dedicated rapporteur and early dialogue, to help optimize development and enable accelerated assessment.
- **Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA)**: A time-limited (one-year, renewable) marketing authorization for medicines that address an unmet medical need, where the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of less comprehensive data than normally required. A positive benefit-risk balance must still be demonstrated, and the sponsor is subject to specific obligations to provide comprehensive confirmatory data post-approval.
- **Accelerated Assessment**: This procedural tool reduces the standard CHMP review timeline from 210 active days to 150 active days for products of major public health interest and therapeutic innovation.

In the **United States**:
- **Fast Track Designation (FTD)**: Facilitates development and expedites review of drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need. Benefits include more frequent meetings with the FDA and eligibility for rolling review (submitting portions of the BLA before the complete application).
- **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)**: For drugs where preliminary clinical evidence indicates substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. It includes all FTD features plus intensive guidance and organizational commitment from senior FDA managers.
- **Accelerated Approval (AA)**: Allows for approval of a drug for a serious condition based on its effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. This pathway requires post-marketing confirmatory trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit.
- **Priority Review (PR)**: A review designation that shortens the FDA's review goal for a BLA from 10 months to 6 months for drugs that would represent a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.
- **Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT)**: A designation specifically for regenerative medicine therapies (including many ATMPs). It requires preliminary clinical evidence that the drug has the potential to address an unmet medical need in a serious condition. RMAT confers the benefits of FTD and BTD and provides additional opportunities for early interaction with the FDA to discuss potential use of surrogate endpoints and other development issues.

#### Important Exceptions and Special Cases

While centralized authorization is the rule, EU law provides for narrow exceptions and specific procedures for special cases.

The **Hospital Exemption**, defined under Article 3(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC, allows for the use of an ATMP without a marketing authorization under very strict, cumulative conditions. This pathway is intended for non-commercial, patient-specific situations and is not a route to market. The key criteria are that the product must be: prepared on a **non-routine basis**; **custom-made** for an **individual patient** under a medical prescription; prepared and used **within a single hospital** in the **same Member State**; under the **exclusive professional responsibility of a medical practitioner**; and subject to **national authorization and quality standards**. It cannot be supplied across borders or used for routine batch manufacturing [@problem_id:4988826].

For **Combined ATMPs**, the interface with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 requires special attention. When a combined ATMP contains an integral device part that is not CE-marked for the specific intended use, the MAA dossier submitted to the EMA must include extensive technical documentation demonstrating the device's compliance with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) of the MDR. The EMA will then formally consult a designated **Notified Body (NB)**, which will review the documentation and provide an opinion on the device's conformity. This NB opinion is a critical component of the EMA's overall benefit-risk assessment of the combined product [@problem_id:4988829].

### The Nonclinical Foundation for Safety and Efficacy

Before any ATMP can be tested in humans, a comprehensive nonclinical program must be conducted to characterize its activity and establish a reasonable expectation of safety. Following a risk-based paradigm, these studies are not a one-size-fits-all checklist but must be tailored to the specific nature of the product. The key areas of investigation, as guided by the EMA and other authorities, address the unique risks posed by living, genetically modified, and/or persistent therapies [@problem_id:4988838].

**Biodistribution, Persistence, and Shedding**: It is essential to understand the product's fate after administration.
- **Biodistribution** studies determine where the product (e.g., viral vector DNA or administered cells) distributes in the body, including target and non-target organs. For gene therapies with potential [off-target effects](@entry_id:203665), a comprehensive tissue panel, including critically the **gonads** to assess risk of germline transmission, is required.
- **Persistence** studies measure how long the product remains in the body. For a durable gene therapy, this requires long-term animal studies (e.g., $\ge 6$ months).
- **Shedding** studies analyze bodily fluids (e.g., urine, saliva, feces) to assess the risk of transmitting a viral vector to untreated individuals. These studies are standard for GTMPs like AAV-based products [@problem_id:4988838]. For cell therapies, in vivo biodistribution and persistence studies are also mandatory, often requiring immunodeficient animal models to allow for survival of the human cells.

**Integration Risk and Tumorigenicity**: This addresses the risk of the product causing cancer.
- **Integration Risk**: This is a primary concern for GTMPs that use integrating vectors, such as lentiviruses (e.g., in CAR-T cells). The vector's integration into the host genome, while necessary for durable expression, carries a risk of disrupting host genes and causing [insertional mutagenesis](@entry_id:266513). Therefore, **Integration Site Analysis (ISA)** is essential to monitor for clonal expansion that could signal a developing malignancy. For primarily episomal vectors like AAV, routine ISA is not typically required, but overall genotoxicity must still be addressed.
- **Tumorigenicity**: For any cell-based product with proliferative capacity (e.g., CAR-T cells, MSCs), a long-term in vivo tumorigenicity study is required to assess the risk of uncontrolled growth or transformation. This is true even for autologous products, as the genetic modification and *ex vivo* culture process can introduce transformation risk. These studies are typically performed in immunodeficient animals [@problem_id:4988838]. For allogeneic MSCs, there is also a risk of forming unintended ectopic tissues (e.g., bone or cartilage).

**Immunogenicity**: This assesses the potential for the product to provoke an unwanted immune response. The nature of the assessment is highly product-specific.
- For AAV-based GTMPs, this involves evaluating immune responses to both the [viral capsid](@entry_id:154485) and the transgene protein, which can impact safety and durability of expression.
- For autologous CAR-T cells, while the cells themselves are not foreign, the CAR is a novel protein and can be immunogenic. Furthermore, key immunological toxicities such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) must be characterized.
- For allogeneic products like MSCs, the potential for an allo-immune response leading to rejection must be evaluated, even though these cells may possess immunomodulatory properties [@problem_id:4988838].

**Replication-Competent Vector (RCV) Testing**: For any product manufactured using a replication-deficient viral vector (e.g., AAV or [lentivirus](@entry_id:267285)), there is a risk of generating a replication-competent virus during the production process. The administration of an RCV could lead to a spreading viral infection in the patient. Consequently, stringent and highly sensitive testing for **rcAAV** or **RCL** is a mandatory safety and quality control measure, performed at multiple stages of manufacturing, including on vector producer cell banks and the final product, as per European Pharmacopoeia or other compendial standards [@problem_id:4988838]. This is required even for vectors with self-inactivating (SIN) designs, as recombination events can still occur.
