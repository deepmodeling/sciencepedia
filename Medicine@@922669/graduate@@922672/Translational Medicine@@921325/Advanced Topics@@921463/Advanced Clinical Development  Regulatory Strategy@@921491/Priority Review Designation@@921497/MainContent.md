## Introduction
In the landscape of therapeutic development, bringing a new medicine from the laboratory to the patient is a complex and lengthy process, governed by stringent regulatory oversight. A central challenge for agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is managing their review capacity to ensure that the most impactful and urgently needed therapies reach patients as quickly as possible. The **Priority Review Designation** stands as a critical regulatory mechanism designed to meet this challenge, serving to expedite the assessment of drugs that hold the potential for significant advancements in treating serious diseases.

This article addresses the fundamental principles and practical applications of this key pathway. It aims to demystify the criteria, procedures, and strategic considerations that define Priority Review. By navigating the intricate details of this designation, readers will gain a robust understanding of how regulatory science and public health ethics converge to accelerate access to innovative medicines.

Across the following chapters, we will dissect the core components of this regulatory tool. The **"Principles and Mechanisms"** chapter lays the groundwork, exploring the ethical foundations and the two-pillar framework of "serious condition" and "significant improvement" that underpin the designation. Next, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** examines real-world case studies, the interplay with other expedited programs, and the global context of accelerated review pathways. Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section provides an opportunity to apply this knowledge to solve complex, scenario-based regulatory challenges, solidifying the concepts discussed.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The decision to grant a marketing license for a new therapeutic is among the most consequential actions of a regulatory authority like the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While all applications for novel medicines demand rigorous scientific review, not all possess the same potential for immediate public health impact. The **Priority Review Designation** is a key regulatory mechanism designed to manage the finite resource of agency review capacity by accelerating the assessment of applications that are poised to offer the most significant advances for patients with serious diseases. This chapter elucidates the ethical principles, regulatory criteria, and procedural mechanics that govern this important pathway.

### The Ethical Foundation for Prioritization

At its core, the practice of prioritizing certain drug reviews is an exercise in applied public health ethics. Regulatory agencies must balance multiple ethical obligations, including beneficence, justice, and respect for persons. The Priority Review pathway is a direct expression of these principles.

The principle of **beneficence**, or the duty to maximize benefits and minimize harm, provides the primary rationale for accelerating access to certain therapies. When a new drug shows promise for a substantial improvement over existing options, every day that its review is delayed can be measured in negative health outcomes for the affected patient population. By shortening the review timeline, the agency acts to maximize health benefits for the community.

However, a purely utilitarian approach that seeks only to maximize aggregate health benefits, such as total **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**, could inadvertently neglect smaller populations or those with less common but more severe diseases. This is where the principle of **justice** becomes critical. Justice, in this context, demands a fair distribution of burdens and benefits, with special attention given to the needs of the worst-off and historically underserved populations. An ethically robust system, therefore, does not simply count total QALYs but applies an equity-weighting to them. Such a system gives greater weight to therapies that address conditions with high severity, near-term risk of mortality or irreversible morbidity, and high unmet need, particularly in underserved communities [@problem_id:5052845]. The Priority Review pathway operationalizes this by explicitly focusing on **serious conditions**, thereby ensuring that regulatory attention is directed toward the most urgent medical needs.

Finally, the principle of **respect for persons** requires that this system of prioritization be transparent and its criteria publicly articulated and consistently applied. This ensures accountability and allows all stakeholders, from patients to drug sponsors, to understand the basis for regulatory decision-making.

### The Two-Pillar Framework for Priority Review

The FDA's framework for granting Priority Review rests on two fundamental pillars, both of which must be satisfied. The marketing application must be for a therapy that (1) targets a **serious condition** and (2) if approved, would provide a **significant improvement** in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies.

#### Pillar 1: Targeting a "Serious Condition"

The threshold criterion for any expedited program, including Priority Review, is that the drug must be intended for a **serious condition**. As defined by the FDA, a serious condition is not determined by its rarity but by its impact on patients. It is a disease or condition associated with morbidity that has a substantial impact on day-to-day functioning, or one that, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one. This judgment is based on factors such as survival, day-to-day functioning, and the likelihood that the disease will progress to a more serious state if left untreated.

For example, a chronic [neurodegenerative disease](@entry_id:169702) characterized by an irreversible decline in a validated functional scale and a non-zero annual mortality risk would unequivocally be considered a serious condition. The presence of existing treatments does not disqualify a condition from being considered serious; the determination is based on the underlying nature and burden of the disease itself [@problem_id:5052853]. This concept must not be confused with the criteria for Orphan Drug Designation, which is based on disease prevalence (affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S.).

#### Pillar 2: Demonstrating a "Significant Improvement"

The second pillar requires the application to contain evidence suggesting that the drug offers a "significant improvement" over existing options. This is a comparative assessment that hinges on two key sub-components: the definition of the comparator ("available therapy") and the definition of the improvement ("significant").

**Defining the Comparator: "Available Therapy"**

The benchmark for comparison is **available therapy**, which the FDA generally defines as a product that is approved or licensed in the United States for the indication in question and represents the current U.S. standard of care. In some instances, an unapproved drug may be considered the standard of care if its use is widespread and supported by high-quality evidence in authoritative clinical guidelines. This definition is U.S.-centric; therapies approved only in other jurisdictions are not typically considered "available therapy" for this purpose.

In situations where there are no approved disease-modifying pharmacotherapies for an indication, the standard of care may be **Best Supportive Care (BSC)**, which comprises measures to optimize comfort and function without actively treating the disease. In such a setting, BSC becomes the "available therapy" for comparison. Demonstrating a clinically meaningful benefit over BSC is a valid and powerful way to show a significant improvement and address an unmet medical need, thereby qualifying for Priority Review [@problem_id:5052886].

**Defining the Improvement: "Significant"**

The improvement must be **significant**, a term that the FDA defines through several potential evidence patterns. The criterion is a "significant improvement in safety **or** effectiveness," a crucial disjunction that provides two distinct pathways to earning Priority Review.

1.  **Significant Improvement in Effectiveness:** This is the most straightforward pathway. It involves demonstrating a superior effect on a clinically meaningful endpoint compared to the available therapy. For instance, in a hypothetical trial for a serious [neurodegenerative disease](@entry_id:169702), if an investigational drug demonstrates a relative risk reduction in mortality of $RRR_{\text{new}} = 0.35$ and an improvement on a functional scale of $\Delta F_{\text{new}} = 0.25$ units, while the available therapy offers only $RRR_{\text{avail}} = 0.15$ and $\Delta F_{\text{avail}} = 0.10$ units, the new drug's markedly superior effect on both mortality and morbidity would constitute a significant improvement in effectiveness [@problem_id:5052853].

2.  **Significant Improvement in Safety:** A drug does not need to be more effective to qualify for Priority Review. An application can be granted this designation if the drug has a safety profile that is materially better than that of an available therapy, provided its efficacy is at least non-inferior. For a safety improvement to be considered "materially" or "significantly" better, it must involve a clinically meaningful reduction in a serious adverse event, be supported by statistically robust evidence (e.g., a $95\%$ confidence interval for the risk difference that excludes zero), and not be offset by other new harms. For example, a new oral anticoagulant that demonstrates non-inferiority to the standard of care in preventing strokes but also shows a statistically significant and clinically important absolute risk reduction of $3.5\%$ in major bleeding events would represent a significant improvement in safety and would be eligible for Priority Review [@problem_id:5052851].

It is also useful to distinguish the standard of **significant improvement** for Priority Review from the standard of **substantial improvement** required for Breakthrough Therapy Designation. While related, "substantial" implies a larger magnitude of effect, often observed in preliminary clinical evidence from early-phase trials, that suggests a transformative advance over available options. "Significant," by contrast, denotes a clear and meaningful benefit demonstrated in the complete data package of a marketing application, which may be of a more moderate, though still clinically important, magnitude [@problem_id:5052814].

### The Regulatory Machinery: Timelines and Procedures

The tangible effect of a Priority Review designation is the shortening of the FDA's review timeline. This process is governed by the **Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)**, which establishes performance goals for the agency.

For most original marketing applications, the PDUFA goal for a **Standard Review** is 10 months. The **Priority Review** designation shortens this goal to 6 months, effectively accelerating the decision on a new drug by about four months.

The procedural sequence for obtaining this designation is well-defined:
1.  **Request:** The sponsor typically requests Priority Review as part of its submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA).
2.  **Filing Review:** Upon receipt of the application, the FDA has 60 calendar days to conduct a filing review. During this period, the agency determines if the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted (or "filed") for a full, substantive review. The agency also evaluates the request for Priority Review during this time.
3.  **Communication and Clock-Setting:** The decisions made during the filing review are formally communicated to the sponsor in what is commonly called the **Day-74 letter** (i.e., around 74 days after submission). This crucial communication states whether the application has been filed and, if so, whether it has been granted a Standard or Priority Review. Most importantly, it announces the PDUFA target action date—the goal date by which the FDA intends to complete its review [@problem_id:5052856].

The calculation of this target date depends on the review designation and application type. For most original applications (e.g., New Molecular Entities), the PDUFA clock starts at the 60-day filing date. A concrete example illustrates the impact: an NDA submitted on August 23, 2028, would have a filing date of October 22, 2028. If granted Priority Review, the target action date would be set six months from the filing date, to April 22, 2029 (a total of 242 days from submission). If given a Standard Review, the target would be ten months from the filing date, to August 22, 2029 (a total of 364 days from submission), a difference of four months [@problem_id:5052875].

### Scope and Context: Clarifying Common Misconceptions

To fully understand the Priority Review designation, it is essential to clarify what it is not. Several common misconceptions can arise from its relationship to other regulatory concepts.

First, **Priority Review applies only to certain application types**. The designation is a feature of the PDUFA framework, which governs the review of human drugs and biologics. Therefore, it is applicable to NDAs, BLAs, and certain efficacy supplements. It does **not** apply to medical devices, which are reviewed under a separate user fee program (the Medical Device User Fee Amendments, or MDUFA) with distinct pathways and timelines, such as the 510(k) or De Novo pathways [@problem_id:5052831].

Second, a **Priority Review Designation is distinct from a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)**. The designation is granted by the FDA based on the intrinsic clinical merit of the drug under review. It is not a transferable asset. In contrast, a PRV is a statutory incentive awarded to a sponsor upon approval of a drug for certain rare pediatric or tropical diseases. This voucher is a transferable, sellable instrument that can be redeemed to secure a priority review timeline for a *different* future drug application, regardless of whether that subsequent drug would have independently qualified for a priority designation on its own merits [@problem_id:5052890].

Finally, and most critically, **Priority Review does not lower the statutory standard for approval**. The FD&C Act requires that a new drug be approved based on "substantial evidence of effectiveness" derived from "adequate and well-controlled investigations," combined with an acceptable safety profile. Priority Review is a procedural tool that modifies the review *timeline* ($t$), not the evidentiary *threshold* ($\tau$). The evidence package ($D$) is fixed at the time of submission. The agency's task is to evaluate that fixed evidence against the fixed statutory standard. The Priority Review designation simply commits the agency to marshalling its resources to complete that evaluation in a shorter period. It is a prioritization of regulatory attention, not a relaxation of regulatory rigor [@problem_id:5052877].

In summary, the Priority Review Designation is a thoughtfully constructed regulatory instrument. Grounded in ethical principles, it uses a rigorous two-pillar framework to identify applications with the greatest potential to advance public health, and it employs a well-defined procedural mechanism to accelerate their path to patients, all while maintaining the high statutory standards for safety and effectiveness that underpin the FDA's public trust.
