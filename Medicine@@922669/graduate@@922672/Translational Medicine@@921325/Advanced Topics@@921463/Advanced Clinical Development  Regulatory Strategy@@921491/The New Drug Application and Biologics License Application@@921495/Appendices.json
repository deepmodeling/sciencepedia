The solution proceeds.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the minimum sample size $N$ for a $2 \\times 2$ crossover bioequivalence study. The analysis is performed on log-transformed pharmacokinetic data.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters on the logarithmic scale. The regulatory equivalence interval on the original scale is $[0.8, 1.25]$. On the log scale, this corresponds to $[\\ln(0.8), \\ln(1.25)]$. Since $\\ln(0.8) = \\ln(4/5) = -\\ln(5/4) = -\\ln(1.25)$, the symmetric equivalence interval on the log scale is $[-\\theta_E, \\theta_E]$, where the equivalence limit $\\theta_E = \\ln(1.25)$.\n\nThe anticipated true geometric mean ratio (GMR) of Test to Reference formulation is $0.95$. On the log scale, this corresponds to the true difference in means, $\\Delta = \\mu_T - \\mu_R = \\ln(0.95)$.\n\nThe within-subject coefficient of variation on the original scale, $CV_W$, is given as $0.20$. For log-normally distributed data, the within-subject variance on the log scale, $\\sigma_W^2$, is derived from $CV_W$ using the relationship:\n$$ \\sigma_W^2 = \\ln(CV_W^2 + 1) $$\n\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ crossover study with a total of $N$ subjects allocated equally to two sequences ($N/2$ per sequence), the variance of the estimator for the difference in means, $\\hat{\\Delta}$, is given by:\n$$ Var(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\frac{2\\sigma_W^2}{N} $$\nThe standard error of the estimator is therefore:\n$$ SE(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma_W^2}{N}} $$\n\nThe TOST procedure is used to establish bioequivalence. This involves testing two one-sided null hypotheses at the $\\alpha$ significance level:\n$H_{01}: \\Delta \\ge \\theta_E$\n$H_{02}: \\Delta \\le -\\theta_E$\n\nBioequivalence is concluded if both null hypotheses are rejected. For study planning, we require that the statistical power to reject both nulls is at least $1-\\beta = 0.90$. A standard, conservative approach to sample size calculation is to ensure that the power to reject each one-sided null hypothesis is at least $1-\\beta$. This requires calculating the necessary sample size for each test and taking the maximum of the two.\n\nUsing a large-sample normal approximation, the condition to achieve a power of at least $1-\\beta$ for the test of $H_{01}$ (the upper bound test) is:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta_E - \\Delta}{SE(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nThis leads to a required sample size $N_U$:\n$$ N_U \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma_W^2 (z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{(\\theta_E - \\Delta)^2} $$\n\nSimilarly, the condition for the test of $H_{02}$ (the lower bound test) is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta - (-\\theta_E)}{SE(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta} \\implies \\frac{\\Delta + \\theta_E}{SE(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nThis leads to a required sample size $N_L$:\n$$ N_L \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma_W^2 (z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{(\\theta_E + \\Delta)^2} $$\n\nThe overall sample size $N$ must satisfy both conditions, so $N = \\max(N_U, N_L)$. We must determine which of $N_U$ or $N_L$ is larger. This depends on which denominator, $(\\theta_E - \\Delta)^2$ or $(\\theta_E + \\Delta)^2$, is smaller. This corresponds to the test against the boundary to which the true mean difference $\\Delta$ is closer.\n\nGiven $\\Delta = \\ln(0.95) < 0$:\nThe distance to the upper bound is $\\theta_E - \\Delta = \\ln(1.25) - \\ln(0.95) = \\ln(1.25/0.95) \\approx \\ln(1.316)$.\nThe distance to the lower bound is $\\Delta - (-\\theta_E) = \\theta_E + \\Delta = \\ln(1.25) + \\ln(0.95) = \\ln(1.25 \\times 0.95) = \\ln(1.1875)$.\nSince $\\ln(1.1875) < \\ln(1.316)$, the true mean $\\Delta$ is closer to the lower bound $-\\theta_E$. The lower bound test is therefore the more challenging one and requires a larger sample size. Thus, we must use the formula for $N_L$.\n\nThe governing planning inequality is:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta_E + \\Delta}{SE(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $SE(\\hat{\\Delta})$ and solving for $N$ gives the closed-form expression for the total sample size:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma_W^2 (z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{(\\theta_E + \\Delta)^2} $$\n\nWe now evaluate this expression numerically with the given inputs:\n- $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $z_{1-\\alpha} = z_{0.95} \\approx 1.64485$.\n- Power $= 0.90$, so $\\beta = 0.10$ and $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.90} \\approx 1.28155$.\n- $CV_W = 0.20$, so $\\sigma_W^2 = \\ln(0.20^2 + 1) = \\ln(1.04)$.\n- $\\theta_E = \\ln(1.25)$.\n- $\\Delta = \\ln(0.95)$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $N$:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2 \\ln(1.04) (z_{0.95} + z_{0.90})^2}{(\\ln(1.25) + \\ln(0.95))^2} $$\nThe denominator can be simplified using logarithm properties: $\\ln(1.25) + \\ln(0.95) = \\ln(1.25 \\times 0.95) = \\ln(1.1875)$.\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2 \\ln(1.04) (z_{0.95} + z_{0.90})^2}{(\\ln(1.1875))^2} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical values:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2 \\times \\ln(1.04) \\times (1.64485 + 1.28155)^2}{(\\ln(1.1875))^2} $$\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2 \\times 0.0392207 \\times (2.92640)^2}{(0.171850)^2} $$\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{0.0784414 \\times 8.56387}{0.0295325} $$\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{0.671911}{0.0295325} $$\n$$ N \\ge 22.751 $$\n\nThe total sample size $N$ must be an even integer.

Assume reversible competitive inhibition and that the substrate concentration is low relative to the Michaelis-Menten constant, so that first-order clearance applies.\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions that (i) for linear pharmacokinetics $AUC = D/CL$ for a given dose $D$, (ii) total clearance is the sum of clearances from parallel pathways, and (iii) for competitive inhibition at low substrate concentration, the catalytic efficiency of the inhibited pathway scales by a factor $1/(1 + I_{u}/K_{i})$, derive a closed-form expression for $AUCR$ in terms of $f_{m}$, $I_{u}$, and $K_{i}$. Then compute $AUCR$ using $f_{m} = 0.6$, $I_{u} = 0.5\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, and $K_{i} = 0.1\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. Round your numerical $AUCR$ to three significant figures. Finally, using the regulatory screening threshold $AUCR \\geq 1.25$ as suggestive of potential clinical relevance, justify in your work whether a dedicated clinical DDI study is warranted within NDA/BLA submissions for labeling decisions.", "solution": "The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expects sponsors of a New Drug Application (NDA) and a Biologics License Application (BLA) to justify the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). For a victim drug with linear pharmacokinetics, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve $AUC$ is given by $AUC = D/CL$ for a dose $D$ and total clearance $CL$. If elimination occurs through two parallel pathways, an inhibited enzyme pathway with clearance $CL_{\\text{m}}$ and all other pathways with clearance $CL_{\\text{non}}$, then $CL = CL_{\\text{non}} + CL_{\\text{m}}$.\n\nDefine the fraction metabolized by the inhibited pathway as $f_{m} = CL_{\\text{m}}/CL$. Then $CL_{\\text{m}} = f_{m}\\,CL$ and $CL_{\\text{non}} = (1 - f_{m})\\,CL$. Under reversible competitive inhibition with inhibitor concentration $I_{u}$ and inhibition constant $K_{i}$, assuming the substrate concentration is small relative to the Michaelis-Menten constant ($K_{m}$), the velocity of the inhibited pathway scales according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics,\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}\\,S}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}\\right) + S} \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}\\right)}\\,S,\n$$\nso the intrinsic clearance of the inhibited pathway is reduced by a factor $\\frac{1}{1 + I_{u}/K_{i}}$.

Therefore, the area under the curve ratio is\n$$\nAUCR = \\frac{AUC_{\\text{inhibited}}}{AUC_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{\\frac{D}{CL'}}{\\frac{D}{CL}} = \\frac{CL}{CL'} = \\frac{1}{1 - f_{m} + \\frac{f_{m}}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}}}.\n$$\n\nNow compute $AUCR$ for $f_{m} = 0.6$, $I_{u} = 0.5\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, and $K_{i} = 0.1\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$.
