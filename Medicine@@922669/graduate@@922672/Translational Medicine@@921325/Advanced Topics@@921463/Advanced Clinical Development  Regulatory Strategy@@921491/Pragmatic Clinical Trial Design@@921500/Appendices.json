In pragmatic trials, where real-world adherence is imperfect, the observed ITT effect is often a diluted version of the effect among those who actually received the treatment (the per-protocol effect). This exercise provides a quantitative framework for understanding this dilution, modeling how adherence and contamination rates scale the per-protocol effect to produce the expected ITT estimand ([@problem_id:5047017]).", "problem": "A two-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) is conducted in a translational medicine context to evaluate a new care pathway versus usual care, with a binary primary clinical endpoint measured at $90$ days. The trial adopts an intention-to-treat (ITT) estimand defined as the difference in the expected endpoint between units assigned to the intervention and units assigned to control, regardless of subsequent adherence. Randomization is operationally implemented so that the assignment indicator $Z \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is independent of all pre-randomization characteristics and potential outcomes. Define $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$ as the indicator of actual receipt of the intervention at least at the minimally effective exposure level, recognizing imperfect adherence is possible in both arms due to real-world implementation (contamination and nonadherence).\n\nAssume the following simple compliance model, consistent with pragmatic trial conditions and translational implementation:\n- In the intervention arm, the probability of achieving minimally effective exposure is $P(D=1 \\mid Z=1) = a_{T}$.\n- In the control arm, the probability of contamination at the minimally effective exposure level is $P(D=1 \\mid Z=0) = a_{C}$.\n\nAssume a structural mean setup for the risk difference that captures a constant average causal effect of treatment receipt on the endpoint expectation, $E[Y \\mid D] = \\alpha + \\delta D$, where $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denotes the endpoint and $\\delta$ represents the per-protocol risk difference between receipt ($D=1$) and non-receipt ($D=0$) of the intervention.

The problem statement is self-contained and scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical trial methodology and causal inference. The definitions of the ITT estimand, adherence ($D$), assignment ($Z$), the structural mean model, and the compliance probabilities ($a_T$, $a_C$) are standard in this field. The parameter values are plausible for a real-world pragmatic trial. The problem is well-posed, objective, and formalizable. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe ITT estimand is defined as the difference in the expected outcome between the group assigned to the intervention and the group assigned to control. Let $Y$ be the binary endpoint, and $Z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be the randomization assignment indicator, where $Z=1$ for the intervention arm and $Z=0$ for the control arm. The ITT estimand, which we denote as $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = E[Y \\mid Z=1] - E[Y \\mid Z=0]\n$$\nTo proceed, we use the Law of Total Expectation to decompose the conditional expectation in each arm based on the actual receipt of the intervention, denoted by the indicator $D \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. For any arm $z \\in \\{0,1\\}$, we have:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid Z=z] = E[E[Y \\mid D, Z=z] \\mid Z=z]\n$$\nThe problem states a structural mean model for the outcome: $E[Y \\mid D] = \\alpha + \\delta D$. This model implies that the expected outcome depends only on the treatment received ($D$), not on the treatment assigned ($Z$). This is a key assumption known as the exclusion restriction: the assignment to a treatment arm affects the outcome only through the receipt of the treatment itself. Under this assumption, $E[Y \\mid D, Z=z] = E[Y \\mid D]$. We can thus substitute the structural model into our expression:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid Z=z] = E[\\alpha + \\delta D \\mid Z=z]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, this becomes:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid Z=z] = E[\\alpha \\mid Z=z] + E[\\delta D \\mid Z=z] = \\alpha + \\delta E[D \\mid Z=z]\n$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[D \\mid Z=z] = P(D=1 \\mid Z=z)$.\n\nNow, we apply this general formula to each arm of the trial.\n\nFor the intervention arm ($Z=1$):\nThe probability of receiving the intervention is given as $P(D=1 \\mid Z=1) = a_T$.\nSo, the expected outcome in the intervention arm is:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid Z=1] = \\alpha + \\delta P(D=1 \\mid Z=1) = \\alpha + \\delta a_T\n$$\n\nFor the control arm ($Z=0$):\nThe probability of receiving the intervention (due to contamination) is given as $P(D=1 \\mid Z=0) = a_C$.\nSo, the expected outcome in the control arm is:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid Z=0] = \\alpha + \\delta P(D=1 \\mid Z=0) = \\alpha + \\delta a_C\n$$\n\nWe can now substitute these expressions back into the definition of the ITT estimand:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = (\\alpha + \\delta a_T) - (\\alpha + \\delta a_C)\n$$\nThe term $\\alpha$, representing the baseline expected outcome under no treatment, cancels out:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = \\delta a_T - \\delta a_C = \\delta (a_T - a_C)\n$$\nThis derived expression shows that the ITT effect is the per-protocol effect ($\\delta$) scaled by the difference in the probabilities of receiving the treatment between the two randomized arms.\n\nThe second part of the task is to calculate the numerical value of $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}$ given the specific parameters:\n- Adherence in the intervention arm: $a_T = 0.78$\n- Contamination in the control arm: $a_C = 0.17$\n- Per-protocol risk difference: $\\delta = -0.132$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = -0.132 \\times (0.78 - 0.17)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the difference in probabilities:\n$$\na_T - a_C = 0.78 - 0.17 = 0.61\n$$\nNow, we multiply this by the per-protocol effect $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = -0.132 \\times 0.61\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = -0.08052\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

The relationship between the observed risk ratio and the true risk ratio can be expressed as $RR_{obs} = RR_{true} \\times B$, where $B$ is the bias factor.

Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$ RR_{obs} \\le \\frac{RR_{EU} \\cdot RR_{UD}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UD} - 1} $$\nThe E-value definition specifies that this minimum strength of association, let's call it $E_v$, is the same for both the exposure and the outcome.
