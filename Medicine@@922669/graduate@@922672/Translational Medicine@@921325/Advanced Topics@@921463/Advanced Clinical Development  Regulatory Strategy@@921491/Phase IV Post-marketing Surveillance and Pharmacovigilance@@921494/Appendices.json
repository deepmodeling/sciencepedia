This exercise introduces the fundamental technique of disproportionality analysis, which uses a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table to compare reporting frequencies. By calculating the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), you will gain hands-on practice with one of the cornerstone metrics used for initial signal screening in pharmacovigilance [@problem_id:5045521].", "problem": "In Phase IV post-marketing surveillance, disproportionality analysis is used to screen for potential safety signals in Spontaneous Reporting Systems (SRS). One widely used measure is the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), which compares the probability of observing a specific adverse event with a given drug to the probability of observing the same event with all other drugs. Starting from the definition of conditional probability, let $E$ denote a specific adverse event and $D$ denote the drug of interest.

It is a standard application of statistical principles in a relevant scientific context. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step analysis, starting with the derivation of the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), followed by its numerical calculation, and then a statistical test of association.\n\n**1. Derivation of the PRR Formula**\n\nThe PRR is defined as the ratio of two conditional probabilities:\n$$PRR = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{P(E \\mid \\text{not } D)}$$\n\nUsing the provided counts, we can estimate these probabilities. The total number of reports associated with the drug of interest, $D$, is the sum of reports of event $E$ with drug $D$ ($a$) and reports of other events with drug $D$ ($b$). Thus, the total number of reports for drug $D$ is $a+b$.\nThe probability of observing event $E$ given drug $D$ is estimated as:\n$$P(E \\mid D) = \\frac{\\text{Number of reports of E with D}}{\\text{Total number of reports with D}} = \\frac{a}{a+b}$$\n\nSimilarly, the total number of reports associated with all other drugs (\"not $D$\") is the sum of reports of event $E$ with other drugs ($c$) and reports of other events with other drugs ($d$). This total is $c+d$.\nThe probability of observing event $E$ given \"not $D$\" is estimated as:\n$$P(E \\mid \\text{not } D) = \\frac{\\text{Number of reports of E with other drugs}}{\\text{Total number of reports with other drugs}} = \\frac{c}{c+d}$$\n\nSubstituting these two expressions into the definition of PRR gives the formula in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$:\n$$PRR = \\frac{a / (a+b)}{c / (c+d)}$$\n\n**2. Numerical Calculation of the PRR**\n\nUsing the given values: $a=120$, $b=480$, $c=300$, and $d=12,000$.\nFirst, calculate the two conditional probabilities:\n$$P(E \\mid D) = \\frac{120}{120+480} = \\frac{120}{600} = 0.2$$\n$$P(E \\mid \\text{not } D) = \\frac{300}{300+12,000} = \\frac{300}{12,300} = \\frac{1}{41}$$\n\nNow, compute the PRR:\n$$PRR = \\frac{0.2}{1/41} = 0.2 \\times 41 = 8.2$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. As an exact value, $8.2$ can be written as $8.200$.\n\n**3. Contingency Table and Chi-Square Statistic**\n\nThe data can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table:\n\n|             | Event $E$ | Other Events | Row Total     |\n|-------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|\n| Drug $D$    | $a=120$   | $b=480$      | $R_1=a+b=600$ |\n| Other Drugs | $c=300$   | $d=12,000$   | $R_2=c+d=12,300$|\n| Column Total| $C_1=a+c=420$ | $C_2=b+d=12,480$ | $N=12,900$ |\n\nThe total number of reports is $N = a+b+c+d = 120+480+300+12,000 = 12,900$.\n\nThe Pearson chi-square statistic, $\\chi^2$, tests for independence between the rows (drug exposure) and columns (event occurrence). For a $2 \\times 2$ table, the formula is:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$\nwhere $O_{ij}$ are the observed counts ($a, b, c, d$) and $E_{ij}$ are the expected counts under the null hypothesis of independence. The expected count for a cell is given by $( \\text{row total} \\times \\text{column total} ) / N$.\n\nA more direct formula for a $2 \\times 2$ table is:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{N(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$$\n\nLet's compute the value using this formula:\nThe term $ad-bc$ is the determinant of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix of counts:\n$$ad-bc = (120)(12,000) - (480)(300) = 1,440,000 - 144,000 = 1,296,000$$\n\nNow, substitute all values into the $\\chi^2$ formula:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{12,900 \\times (1,296,000)^2}{(600)(12,300)(420)(12,480)}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{12,900 \\times 1.679616 \\times 10^{12}}{(7,380,000)(5,241,600)} \\approx \\frac{2.1667044 \\times 10^{16}}{3.8680128 \\times 10^{13}} \\approx 559.97$$\n\nThe chi-square statistic is approximately $560.0$.\n\n**4. Interpretation of the Results**\n\nIn pharmacovigilance screening, a potential safety signal is often flagged when two conditions are met:\n1.  A measure of disproportionality, such as the PRR, exceeds a certain threshold. A commonly used threshold is $PRR  2$, which suggests the event is reported more than twice as frequently for the drug of interest compared to other drugs.\n2.  The association has sufficient statistical support, meaning it is unlikely to be a result of random chance. This is assessed using a statistical test, like the chi-square test. A common criterion is that the chi-square statistic must be statistically significant, often corresponding to a $p$-value less than $0.05$. For a $2 \\times 2$ table with $1$ degree of freedom, the critical value for $\\chi^2$ at a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$ is approximately $3.84$.\n\nIn this analysis:\n- The calculated $PRR = 8.2$, which is substantially greater than the threshold of $2$. This indicates a strong disproportionality.\n- The calculated $\\chi^2 \\approx 560$, which is vastly greater than the critical value of $3.84$. This corresponds to an extremely small $p$-value, indicating that the observed association between drug $D$ and event $E$ is statistically highly significant.\n\nThe combination of a high PRR and a large, statistically significant $\\chi^2$ value meets the standard criteria for identifying a safety signal. This finding does not prove causality but provides strong evidence that warrants further clinical and epidemiological investigation to assess the potential causal relationship between drug $D$ and adverse event $E$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.200}\n$$", "id": "5045521"}, {"introduction": "While spontaneous reports are essential for hypothesis generation, more structured epidemiological methods are needed to formally quantify risk.

A total of $N=50{,}000$ administrations of the therapy occurred, and each administration defines a prespecified risk window of $28$ days post-exposure.

The numbers are plausible.\n- **Structure and Clarity**: The terms are well-defined. The question is unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the total person-time at risk in the study cohort. This person-time is then used, in conjunction with the background incidence rate, to calculate the expected number of events under the null hypothesis that the therapy does not alter the risk. Finally, the ratio of the observed count to this expected count is computed.\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Person-Time at Risk**\n    The total person-time at risk is the sum of the risk windows for all administrations. There are $N=50{,}000$ administrations, and each contributes a risk window of $28$ days.\n    Therefore, the total person-time at risk, denoted $PT$, is:\n    $$PT = N \\times 28 \\text{ days} = 50{,}000 \\times 28 \\text{ person-days} = 1{,}400{,}000 \\text{ person-days}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Expected Number of Events ($E$)**\n    The expected number of events, $E$, is the product of the background incidence rate, $I$, and the total person-time at risk, $PT$. To perform this calculation, the units of $I$ and $PT$ must be consistent.\n    The background incidence rate is given as $I=5$ cases per $100{,}000$ person-$28$-days.\n    It is most direct to convert our total person-time, $PT$, into the units used for the rate. A \"person-$28$-day\" is a unit of person-time equivalent to one person being at risk for $28$ days.\n    The total person-time in units of person-$28$-days is:\n    $$PT_{\\text{28-days}} = \\frac{1{,}400{,}000 \\text{ person-days}}{28 \\text{ days}} = 50{,}000 \\text{ person-28-days}$$\n    This calculation could also be seen directly: $N=50{,}000$ administrations each contribute exactly one person-$28$-day of risk, for a total of $50{,}000$ person-$28$-days.\n\n    The incidence rate $I$ is expressed per $100{,}000$ person-$28$-days. We can write the rate as:\n    $$I = \\frac{5 \\text{ cases}}{100{,}000 \\text{ person-28-days}}$$\n    Now, we calculate the expected number of cases, $E$, by multiplying the rate by the total person-time at risk:\n    $$E = I \\times PT_{\\text{28-days}} = \\left( \\frac{5 \\text{ cases}}{100{,}000 \\text{ person-28-days}} \\right) \\times (50{,}000 \\text{ person-28-days})$$\n    The \"person-$28$-days\" units cancel, leaving a dimensionless quantity for the number of cases:\n    $$E = 5 \\times \\frac{50{,}000}{100{,}000} = 5 \\times 0.5 = 2.5$$\n    Thus, under the null hypothesis of background risk only, the expected number of events is $2.5$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Observed-to-Expected (O/E) Ratio**\n    The O/E ratio is defined as the ratio of the observed number of cases, $O$, to the expected number of cases, $E$.\n    The observed number of cases is given as $O=12$.\n    The O/E ratio is therefore:\n    $$\\text{O/E} = \\frac{O}{E} = \\frac{12}{2.5} = 4.8$$\n\n4.  **Final Formatting**\n    The problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Unmeasured confounding—where a hidden factor is associated with both the drug and the outcome—is a major concern in all observational research. This advanced practice introduces the E-value, a sensitivity analysis tool used to assess the robustness of an observed association to such unmeasured confounding. By calculating and interpreting the E-value, you will learn to quantify the minimum strength of association an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to fully explain away the finding, a vital skill for critically appraising evidence in translational medicine [@problem_id:5045491].", "problem": "In phase IV post-marketing surveillance within translational medicine, a large, population-based observational study using Electronic Health Records (EHR) reports an adjusted risk ratio $RR=2.4$ for the association between a newly marketed drug and a specific adverse clinical outcome after control for measured covariates.

Starting from the core definitions of the risk ratio on the $A \\rightarrow Y$ pathway, the concept of a confounding bias factor defined as $B=RR^{\\text{obs}}/RR^{\\text{true}}$, and well-tested Cornfield-type bounds that relate $B$ to the risk ratio associations of $U$ with $A$ and $Y$ conditional on measured covariates, formally define the E-value for unmeasured confounding on the risk ratio scale as the minimum magnitude of the risk ratio association that the confounder must have with both $A$ and $Y$ to move an observed association to the null ($RR^{\\text{true}}=1$).

A formal definition of the E-value is provided: the minimum magnitude of the risk ratio association that the confounder must have with both $A$ and $Y$ to shift the observed association to the null, i.e., to make $RR^{\\text{true}} = 1$.\n6.  A symmetry assumption is to be used: $RR_{AU} = RR_{UY}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in the field of causal inference and sensitivity analysis within epidemiology and translational medicine. All necessary components for the derivation are provided or clearly implied by the reference to established principles. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the observed risk ratio ($RR^{\\text{obs}}$), the true risk ratio ($RR^{\\text{true}}$), and the bias factor ($B$) introduced by the unmeasured confounder $U$. This relationship is multiplicative:\n$$ RR^{\\text{obs}} = B \\times RR^{\\text{true}} $$\n\nTo explain away the observed association, or move it to the null, means we are considering the hypothetical scenario where the true risk ratio is unity, i.e., $RR^{\\text{true}} = 1$. In this scenario, the observed risk ratio is entirely due to confounding:\n$$ RR^{\\text{obs}} = B \\times 1 = B $$\nThis means we are seeking a confounder $U$ that can generate a bias factor $B$ equal in magnitude to the observed risk ratio $RR^{\\text{obs}}$.\n\nThe problem refers to Cornfield-type bounds, which constrain the maximum possible bias factor, $B_{\\text{max}}$, that can be generated by a confounder with specific strengths of association with the exposure ($RR_{AU}$) and the outcome ($RR_{UY}$). A key inequality, which is exact for odds ratios and holds as a close approximation for risk ratios when the outcome is rare (a common scenario in pharmacovigilance), bounds the bias factor as follows:\n$$ B \\leq B_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{RR_{AU} \\cdot RR_{UY}}{RR_{AU} + RR_{UY} - 1} $$\nFor a confounder to be capable of explaining away the observed risk ratio $RR^{\\text{obs}}$, the value of $RR^{\\text{obs}}$ must be less than or equal to the maximum possible bias $B_{\\text{max}}$ that this confounder can induce.\n$$ RR^{\\text{obs}} \\le \\frac{RR_{AU} \\cdot RR_{UY}}{RR_{AU} + RR_{UY} - 1} $$\n\nThe E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, which we will call $RR_C$, that the confounder must have with *both* the exposure and the outcome. This corresponds to the symmetry assumption provided in the problem:\n$$ RR_{AU} = RR_{UY} = RR_C $$\nSubstituting this into the inequality, we get:\n$$ RR^{\\text{obs}} \\le \\frac{RR_C \\cdot RR_C}{RR_C + RR_C - 1} = \\frac{RR_C^2}{2RR_C - 1} $$\n\nWe are looking for the minimum value of $RR_C$ (where $RR_C \\ge 1$ by definition of a risk ratio for a positive association) that satisfies this inequality. Let us analyze the function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{2x - 1}$. Its derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{2x(2x - 1) - x^2(2)}{(2x - 1)^2} = \\frac{4x^2 - 2x - 2x^2}{(2x - 1)^2} = \\frac{2x^2 - 2x}{(2x - 1)^2} = \\frac{2x(x-1)}{(2x - 1)^2} $$\nFor $x  1$, the derivative $f'(x)$ is positive, which means the function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x  1$. Therefore, the inequality $RR^{\\text{obs}} \\le f(RR_C)$ is equivalent to $f^{-1}(RR^{\\text{obs}}) \\le RR_C$. The minimum value of $RR_C$ that satisfies this is precisely $f^{-1}(RR^{\\text{obs}})$.\n\nTo find the inverse function, we must solve for $x$ in the equation $y = f(x)$:\n$$ y = \\frac{x^2}{2x - 1} $$\n$$ y(2x - 1) = x^2 $$\n$$ 2yx - y = x^2 $$\nRearranging this gives a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$$ x^2 - (2y)x + y = 0 $$\nWe solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-2y$, and $c=y$:\n$$ x = \\frac{2y \\pm \\sqrt{(-2y)^2 - 4(1)(y)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{2y \\pm \\sqrt{4y^2 - 4y}}{2} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{2y \\pm 2\\sqrt{y^2 - y}}{2} $$\n$$ x = y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - y} $$\nThis yields two possible branches for the inverse function. We must select the branch that is consistent with the domain of $f(x)$, which is $x \\ge 1$. The inverse function must map the range $y \\ge 1$ back to the domain $x \\ge 1$.\nLet's examine the solution $x = y - \\sqrt{y^2 - y}$. For $y  1$, we have $y-1  0$ and $\\sqrt{y^2-y} = \\sqrt{y(y-1)}  \\sqrt{(y-1)(y-1)} = y-1$. Thus, $y - \\sqrt{y^2-y}  y - (y-1) = 1$. This branch of the solution gives values less than $1$ and is not the correct inverse for our domain.\nLet's examine the other solution, $x = y + \\sqrt{y^2 - y}$. For $y \\ge 1$, we have $y \\ge 1$ and $\\sqrt{y^2 - y} \\ge 0$, so their sum is clearly greater than or equal to $1$. This is the correct branch for the inverse function.\n\nThus, the minimum required value for $RR_C$ is given by replacing $y$ with $RR^{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$ \\text{E-value} = RR_C = RR^{\\text{obs}} + \\sqrt{(RR^{\\text{obs}})^2 - RR^{\\text{obs}}} = RR^{\\text{obs}} + \\sqrt{RR^{\\text{obs}}(RR^{\\text{obs}} - 1)} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the E-value.\n\nNow, we compute the E-value for the given observed risk ratio, $RR^{\\text{obs}} = 2.4$.\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 2.4 + \\sqrt{2.4(2.4 - 1)} $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 2.4 + \\sqrt{2.4(1.4)} $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 2.4 + \\sqrt{3.36} $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} \\approx 2.4 + 1.83303027... $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} \\approx 4.23303027... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $4.233$.\nThis result implies that for an unmeasured confounder to fully explain the observed risk ratio of $2.4$, it would need to have a risk ratio of at least $4.233$ with both the drug exposure and the adverse outcome, which represents a very strong confounding association.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.233}$$", "id": "5045491"}]}
