The Risk Priority Number (RPN) is defined as $RPN = S \\times L \\times D$, where $S$ is the severity rating, $L$ is the likelihood (occurrence) rating, and $D$ is the detectability rating. Ratings are assigned on anchored ordinal scales from $1$ (best) to $10$ (worst) for each dimension. Two high-impact risks have been identified:\n\n- Risk A: Missed primary endpoint spirometry due to mis-scheduled visit windows in Electronic Data Capture (EDC) workflows.\n  - Severity $S_A = 9$ (major impact on primary endpoint integrity)\n  - Likelihood $L_A = 2$ (rare)\n  - Detectability $D_A = 7$ (poorly detectable until late-stage review)\n\n- Risk B: Informed consent re-consent documentation errors following protocol amendments.\n  - Severity $S_B = 6$ (moderate impact, generally remediable)\n  - Likelihood $L_B = 5$ (occasional)\n  - Detectability $D_B = 3$ (readily detectable through central document quality control)\n\nThe Quality and Risk Management Committee is considering a transformation that emphasizes severity by mapping $S$ to $S' = S^{\\alpha}$ for some exponent $\\alpha > 0$, while leaving $L$ and $D$ unchanged. Under this transformation, the transformed Risk Priority Number becomes $RPN' = S' \\times L \\times D = S^{\\alpha} \\times L \\times D$.\n\nStarting from the definition of the Risk Priority Number and the described transformation of severity, derive the value of $\\alpha$ for which the transformed priority of Risk A and Risk B are exactly equal (that is, $RPN'_A = RPN'_B$).

No units are required for $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of quality risk management (specifically Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, FMEA), well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe Risk Priority Number ($RPN$) is given by the product of three ratings: Severity ($S$), Likelihood ($L$), and Detectability ($D$).\n$$RPN = S \\times L \\times D$$\nThe ratings for the two identified risks, Risk A and Risk B, are provided:\n- Risk A: $S_A = 9$, $L_A = 2$, $D_A = 7$\n- Risk B: $S_B = 6$, $L_B = 5$, $D_B = 3$\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline $RPN$ for each risk to establish the initial prioritization.\nFor Risk A:\n$$RPN_A = S_A \\times L_A \\times D_A = 9 \\times 2 \\times 7 = 126$$\nFor Risk B:\n$$RPN_B = S_B \\times L_B \\times D_B = 6 \\times 5 \\times 3 = 90$$\nSince $RPN_A > RPN_B$, Risk A has the higher initial priority.\n\nA transformation is introduced that re-weights the severity score $S$ to a new score $S' = S^{\\alpha}$ for some exponent $\\alpha > 0$. The transformed Risk Priority Number, $RPN'$, is defined as:\n$$RPN' = S' \\times L \\times D = S^{\\alpha} \\times L \\times D$$\nWe are tasked with finding the value of $\\alpha$ for which the transformed priorities of Risk A and Risk B are exactly equal. This condition is expressed as:\n$$RPN'_A = RPN'_B$$\nSubstituting the definition of $RPN'$:\n$$S_A^{\\alpha} \\times L_A \\times D_A = S_B^{\\alpha} \\times L_B \\times D_B$$\nTo solve for $\\alpha$, we first group the terms involving $S$ and the other terms separately. We rearrange the equation to isolate the terms raised to the power of $\\alpha$:\n$$\\frac{S_A^{\\alpha}}{S_B^{\\alpha}} = \\frac{L_B \\times D_B}{L_A \\times D_A}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\left(\\frac{S_A}{S_B}\\right)^{\\alpha} = \\frac{L_B D_B}{L_A D_A}$$\nTo solve for the exponent $\\alpha$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{S_A}{S_B}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_B D_B}{L_A D_A}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$, we get:\n$$\\alpha \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_A}{S_B}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_B D_B}{L_A D_A}\\right)$$\nIsolating $\\alpha$ yields the exact analytical expression:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{L_B D_B}{L_A D_A}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_A}{S_B}\\right)}$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of the given quantities.\n\nThe reason this severity scaling can alter the prioritization lies in its non-linear effect on the multiplicative score. The initial risk priority is determined by the ratio $\\frac{RPN_A}{RPN_B}$. After transformation, this ratio becomes $\\frac{RPN'_A}{RPN'_B} = \\left(\\frac{S_A}{S_B}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{L_A D_A}{L_B D_B}\\right)$.\nIn this problem, $S_A > S_B$ (specifically, $\\frac{S_A}{S_B} = \\frac{9}{6} = 1.5 > 1$), while the product of the other factors is reversed: $L_A D_A < L_B D_B$ (specifically, $\\frac{L_A D_A}{L_B D_B} = \\frac{14}{15} < 1$).\nThe initial prioritization, where Risk A is higher, is due to the a larger contribution from the severity term compared to the combined likelihood-detectability term: $\\frac{S_A}{S_B} > \\frac{L_B D_B}{L_A D_A}$.\nWhen $\\alpha > 1$, the function $f(S) = S^\\alpha$ grows faster for larger values of $S$, so the ratio $\\left(\\frac{S_A}{S_B}\\right)^\\alpha$ becomes even larger than $\\frac{S_A}{S_B}$. This would further increase the priority of Risk A.\nConversely, when $0 < \\alpha < 1$, the function $f(S) = S^\\alpha$ is concave, compressing the scale. The ratio $\\left(\\frac{S_A}{S_B}\\right)^\\alpha$ becomes smaller than $\\frac{S_A}{S_B}$. This diminishes the dominance of the higher severity score, $S_A$. If $\\alpha$ is sufficiently small, the influence of the severity term can be reduced to the point where the larger $L \\times D$ product of Risk B dictates the overall priority, causing a reversal. The value of $\\alpha$ we have derived is the critical point where these competing factors are perfectly balanced.\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerical value of $\\alpha$ using the given data:\n$$S_A = 9, \\quad S_B = 6$$\n$$L_A D_A = 2 \\times 7 = 14$$\n$$L_B D_B = 5 \\times 3 = 15$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{15}{14}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{9}{6}\\right)} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{15}{14}\\right)}{\\ln(1.5)}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values of the logarithms:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{15}{14}\\right) \\approx \\ln(1.07142857) \\approx 0.06899295...$$\n$$\\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.40546510...$$\nTherefore, $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{0.06899295}{0.40546510} \\approx 0.1701584$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we obtain:\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.1702$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1702}$$", "id": "5057580"}, {"introduction": "Effective RBM moves beyond static risk lists to encompass dynamic, data-driven surveillance of the clinical trial as it progresses.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a formal solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $t$ represent a tier, where $t \\in \\{H, M, L\\}$. For each tier, let $n_t$ be the sample size and $p_t$ be the true error rate. The process of checking a single data field for an error is a Bernoulli trial, where success is defined as finding an error. The probability of success in a single trial is $p_t$.\n\nThe probability of *not* finding an error in a single trial is $(1 - p_t)$. Since the sampling is modeled as $n_t$ independent and identically distributed trials, the probability of finding *no* errors in the entire sample of size $n_t$ is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ P(\\text{no errors in } n_t \\text{ trials}) = (1 - p_t)^{n_t} $$\n\nThe objective is to ensure that the probability of detecting *at least one* error is at least $\\pi$. The event \"at least one error\" is the complement of the event \"no errors\". Therefore, the probability of detecting at least one error is:\n$$ P(\\text{at least one error}) = 1 - P(\\text{no errors in } n_t \\text{ trials}) = 1 - (1 - p_t)^{n_t} $$\n\nThe design objective is expressed as the following inequality:\n$$ 1 - (1 - p_t)^{n_t} \\ge \\pi $$\n\nTo find the minimal sample size $n_t$, we solve this inequality for $n_t$.\nFirst, rearrange the terms:\n$$ (1 - p_t)^{n_t} \\le 1 - \\pi $$\n\nTo isolate $n_t$ from the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. As $\\ln(x)$ is a strictly increasing function for $x > 0$, the direction of the inequality is preserved:\n$$ \\ln((1 - p_t)^{n_t}) \\le \\ln(1 - \\pi) $$\n$$ n_t \\ln(1 - p_t) \\le \\ln(1 - \\pi) $$\n\nNow, we must divide by $\\ln(1 - p_t)$. Since $p_t > 0$, we have $1 - p_t < 1$, which implies that $\\ln(1 - p_t)$ is a negative number. Dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$ n_t \\ge \\frac{\\ln(1 - \\pi)}{\\ln(1 - p_t)} $$\n\nSince the sample size $n_t$ must be an integer, the minimal integer value for $n_t$ that satisfies this condition is the ceiling of the expression on the right-hand side.\n$$ n_t = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(1 - \\pi)}{\\ln(1 - p_t)} \\right\\rceil $$\n\nWe are given $\\pi = 0.95$, so $1 - \\pi = 0.05$.
