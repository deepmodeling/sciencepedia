Let $i$ index taxa, let $a_i$ denote the absolute abundance (cells per gram or $16\\text{S}$ copies per gram), let $L$ denote the total microbial load (sum across all taxa), and let $p_i$ denote the relative abundance defined by $p_i = a_i / L$ with the compositional constraint $\\sum_i p_i = 1$.

The concepts of absolute abundance ($a_i$), relative abundance ($p_i$), total microbial load ($L$), $16\\text{S}$ rRNA gene qPCR, and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) are standard and scientifically sound. The core issue, known as compositionality, is a fundamental challenge in the analysis of microbiome sequencing data. The premise is factually and scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides clear definitions for all variables ($p_i = a_i/L, L = \\sum_i a_i$) and sufficient numerical data to perform the required calculations. The question asks for an evaluation of specific statements based on these definitions and data, which allows for a unique and logical resolution.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is phrased in objective, technical language. The data are provided as precise numerical values without any subjective or ambiguous modifiers.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary data to evaluate the statements. The definitions and data are internally consistent.\n5.  **Realism:** The absolute abundance values ($10^8$ to $10^{10}$ copies per gram) are physically realistic for bacteria in human stool. The scenario of FMT for recurrent *Clostridioides difficile* infection is a primary clinical application where such analysis is performed. The problem is realistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a a valid and canonical problem in quantitative biology. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between relative abundance ($p_i$), absolute abundance ($a_i$), and total microbial load ($L$). The definition is given as:\n$$ p_i = \\frac{a_i}{L} $$\nWhen comparing two conditions (e.g., baseline $1$ and post-FMT $2$), the change in relative abundance for a taxon $i$ is given by the ratio $p_{i,2}/p_{i,1}$:\n$$ \\frac{p_{i,2}}{p_{i,1}} = \\frac{a_{i,2} / L_2}{a_{i,1} / L_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_{i,2}}{a_{i,1}}\\right) \\bigg/ \\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right) $$\nThis equation demonstrates that the fold change in relative abundance is the fold change in absolute abundance divided by the fold change in total load. Inference on relative abundance ($p_i$) can be misleading about the change in absolute abundance ($a_i$) if the total load ($L$) changes between conditions.\n\nLet us apply this to the provided data for taxon $X$:\n1.  **Change in absolute abundance ($a_X$):**\n    The fold change is $\\dfrac{a_{X,2}}{a_{X,1}} = \\dfrac{6.0 \\times 10^{8}}{5.0 \\times 10^{8}} = 1.2$.\n    Since this ratio is greater than $1$, the absolute abundance of taxon $X$ increased by $20\\%$.\n\n2.  **Change in total load ($L$):**\n    The fold change is $\\dfrac{L_2}{L_1} = \\dfrac{2.2 \\times 10^{10}}{1.0 \\times 10^{10}} = 2.2$.\n    The total microbial load increased by $120\\%$.\n\n3.  **Change in relative abundance ($p_X$):**\n    First, we calculate the relative abundances at each timepoint:\n    $$ p_{X,1} = \\frac{a_{X,1}}{L_1} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{8}}{1.0 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.05 $$\n    $$ p_{X,2} = \\frac{a_{X,2}}{L_2} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{8}}{2.2 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{6}{220} = \\frac{3}{110} \\approx 0.02727 $$\n    The fold change is $\\dfrac{p_{X,2}}{p_{X,1}} = \\dfrac{0.02727...}{0.05} \\approx 0.5454...$.\n    Alternatively, using the derived formula:\n    $$ \\frac{p_{X,2}}{p_{X,1}} = \\frac{\\text{fold change in } a_X}{\\text{fold change in } L} = \\frac{1.2}{2.2} = \\frac{12}{22} = \\frac{6}{11} \\approx 0.5454... $$\n    Since this ratio is less than $1$, the relative abundance of taxon $X$ decreased by approximately $45.5\\%$.\n\nThis calculation confirms the core issue: a statistical test on relative abundance data ($p_X$) would likely conclude that taxon $X$ decreased, whereas its absolute abundance ($a_X$) actually increased. This is a classic example of compositional confounding.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In this patient, $a_{X}$ increased but $p_{X}$ decreased because $\\dfrac{a_{X,2}}{a_{X,1}}  \\dfrac{L_2}{L_1}$; therefore, a differential test on $p_{X}$ would produce a spurious negative for the absolute change.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** Our calculations show that $a_X$ increased (fold change $1.2$) while $p_X$ decreased (fold change $\\approx 0.545$). The reason for the decrease in $p_X$ is that the fold change in $L$ ($2.2$) was greater than the fold change in $a_X$ ($1.2$). The condition $\\dfrac{a_{X,2}}{a_{X,1}}  \\dfrac{L_2}{L_1}$ is precisely the condition for $\\dfrac{p_{X,2}}{p_{X,1}}  1$. In our case, $1.2  2.2$, which is true. A differential test on $p_X$ would detect a decrease. This is a \"spurious negative\" because the true change in absolute amount was positive (an increase), meaning the test on relative data gives a misleading result directionally opposite to the absolute change. The statement is entirely correct according to first principles and the data.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Relative and absolute abundance are interchangeable once sequencing depth is normalized; inference on $p_i$ recovers changes in $a_i$ even if $L$ changes.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. Normalizing sequencing depth (e.g., by converting read counts to proportions or rarefying) is a technical correction to ensure that the total number of reads is constant across samples. This procedure yields estimates of relative abundance, $p_i$. It does not, and cannot, account for biological changes in the total microbial load, $L$. The very example in the problem, where inference on $p_i$ and $a_i$ give opposite results, directly refutes this claim. Compositionality is an inherent property of the data relative to a biological total, not just a technical artifact of sequencing depth.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Applying the centered log-ratio (CLR) transform to $p_i$ fully recovers absolute fold changes in $a_i$ without any external measurement of $L$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The CLR transform is defined as $\\text{clr}(p_i) = \\log(p_i) - \\text{mean}(\\log(\\mathbf{p}))$. The change between two time points is $\\Delta\\text{clr}(p_i) = \\text{clr}(p_{i,2}) - \\text{clr}(p_{i,1})$. Substituting $p_i = a_i/L$, we get $\\log(p_i) = \\log(a_i) - \\log(L)$. The change in CLR is:\n    $$ \\Delta\\text{clr}(p_i) = [\\log(a_{i,2}) - \\log(L_2)] - [\\log(a_{i,1}) - \\log(L_1)] - [\\overline{\\log(\\mathbf{a}_2)} - \\log(L_2)] + [\\overline{\\log(\\mathbf{a}_1)} - \\log(L_1)] $$\n    $$ \\Delta\\text{clr}(p_i) = \\log\\left(\\frac{a_{i,2}}{a_{i,1}}\\right) - \\left( \\overline{\\log(\\mathbf{a}_2)} - \\overline{\\log(\\mathbf{a}_1)} \\right) $$\n    The change in CLR-transformed data equals the log-fold-change in absolute abundance *minus* the change in the geometric mean of all absolute abundances. It does not equal the log-fold-change in $a_i$ alone, unless the geometric mean of absolute abundances is constant across samples, which is not generally true and is certainly not guaranteed. Thus, CLR does not recover absolute fold changes without external information.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Incorporating an external estimate of $L$ (for example, via internal spike-in DNA standards, flow cytometry, or digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR)) and modeling $a_i$ directly or including $\\log L$ as an offset in a generalized linear model (GLM) mitigates compositional confounding and avoids spurious negatives.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This statement proposes the correct family of solutions. If an independent measurement of total load $L$ is available for each sample, one can directly calculate estimates of absolute abundances: $a_i = p_i \\times L$. Statistical testing can then be performed on the $a_i$ values, which are not compositional and represent the quantity of interest. Alternatively, in a count-based GLM (e.g., Negative Binomial), the expected count for taxon $i$ in sample $s$, $E[C_{is}]$, can be modeled as a function of absolute abundance $a_{is}$. The relationship is $E[C_{is}] \\propto p_{is} \\propto a_{is}/L_s$. A typical GLM has the form $\\log(E[C_{is}]) = \\text{predictors} + \\text{offset}$. Usually, the offset is $\\log(\\text{sequencing depth})$. By including $\\log(L_s)$ in the model formulation, typically as an additional offset term, the model's coefficients can be interpreted as effects on $\\log(a_{is})$, thereby correctly testing for changes in absolute abundance. This is a standard and valid approach to overcome compositional effects.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. Rarefying read counts to equal sequencing depth per sample removes the compositional constraint $\\sum_i p_i = 1$ and thus prevents spurious negatives when $L$ changes across samples.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** Rarefying is a method of subsampling read counts to achieve equal library sizes across samples. It is one way to normalize for technical variation in sequencing depth. However, the resulting data are still fundamentally compositional. After rarefying to a depth of $N$, the new proportions are $p'_i = (\\text{rarefied count for } i) / N$. The sum of these new proportions across all taxa $i$ is still constrained: $\\sum_i p'_i = 1$. Rarefaction does not alter the fact that the measurements are relative proportions of a whole, and it certainly does not provide information about the biological total load $L$. Therefore, it does not solve the problem of compositional confounding arising from changes in $L$.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "5071692"}, {"introduction": "Building directly on the challenge of compositionality, this exercise introduces a powerful solution: absolute quantification using spike-in standards.

The laboratory pipeline adds a known number of synthetic calibrator copies to each stool sample prior to extraction and polymerase chain reaction amplification of the $16\\text{S}$ ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Assume the following fundamental base: observed sequencing read counts are proportional to the number of input amplicon template molecules in the library under linear sampling, and the proportionality factor (reflecting extraction, library preparation, and sequencing sampling efficiency within a sample) is identical for endogenous amplicons and the spike-in calibrator. Further assume the same known spike-in copy number is added to each sample, and mass-normalization from the processed stool mass converts total molecules in the processed aliquot to molecules per gram.\n\nLet $N_{s}$ denote the known number of spike-in copies added to each sample, $s$ the observed spike-in read count, $c_{i}$ the observed read count for the target taxon, and $m$ the processed stool mass in grams for the sample.

Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages. First, we derive a general expression for the absolute abundance of a taxon per gram of stool. Second, we apply this expression to the provided donor and recipient data to calculate the engraftment efficiency.\n\nThe fundamental principle stated is that for any given sample, the observed sequencing read count is directly proportional to the number of input DNA template molecules. This proportionality constant, let's call it $k$, is assumed to be the same for the endogenous target taxon and the synthetic spike-in standard within that sample. The constant $k$ encapsulates all sample-specific efficiencies, including DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing depth.\n\nLet $N_{i}$ be the absolute number of template molecules (copies) of the target taxon in the processed aliquot of mass $m$. Let $c_{i}$ be the observed read count for this taxon. The proportionality is expressed as:\n$$c_{i} = k N_{i}$$\nLet $N_{s}$ be the known number of spike-in standard molecules added to the same aliquot. Let $s$ be the observed read count for the spike-in. The same proportionality holds:\n$$s = k N_{s}$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations for a single sample. The sample-specific efficiency factor $k$ is unknown, but it can be eliminated. From the second equation, we can express $k$ in terms of known or measured quantities:\n$$k = \\frac{s}{N_{s}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ into the first equation yields:\n$$c_{i} = \\left(\\frac{s}{N_{s}}\\right) N_{i}$$\nOur goal is to determine the number of taxon molecules, $N_{i}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $N_{i}$:\n$$N_{i} = N_{s} \\frac{c_{i}}{s}$$\nThis equation gives the total number of taxon molecules in the processed aliquot of mass $m$. The problem asks for the absolute abundance per gram, which we denote as $a$. This is obtained by dividing the total number of molecules $N_{i}$ by the mass $m$ in grams:\n$$a = \\frac{N_{i}}{m}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $N_{i}$, we arrive at the general formula for the absolute abundance per gram of the taxon:\n$$a = \\frac{N_{s} c_{i}}{m s}$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the donor-to-recipient engraftment efficiency, $E$, which is defined as the ratio of the recipient's absolute abundance to the donor's absolute abundance.

The last term is $0.01\\ln(0.01) \\approx 0.01(-4.605170) = -0.046052$.\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\ln(c_i) \\approx -1.029654 - 0.046052 = -1.075706$$\nWith $T = 1.01$, we have $\\ln(T) = \\ln(1.01) \\approx 0.009950$.\n$$H_1 \\approx 0.009950 - \\frac{1}{1.01}(-1.075706) \\approx 0.009950 + 1.065055 = 1.075005$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $H_1 \\approx 1.075$.\n\nThe post-intervention Gini-Simpson diversity, $S_1$, is:\n$$S_1 = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{4} p_{1,i}^2 = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left(\\frac{c_i}{T}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{T^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i^2$$\nWe calculate the sum of squares $\\sum c_i^2$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i^2 = 0.5^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.01^2$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i^2 = 0.25 + 0.09 + 0.04 + 0.0001 = 0.3801$$\nWith $T = 1.01$, $T^2 = 1.0201$.\n$$S_1 = 1 - \\frac{0.3801}{1.0201} \\approx 1 - 0.3726105 = 0.6273895$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $S_1 \\approx 0.6274$.\n\nThe final results, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- Baseline Shannon index $H_0 = 1.030$\n- Baseline Gini-Simpson index $S_0 = 0.6200$\n- Post-intervention Shannon index $H_1 = 1.075$\n- Post-intervention Gini-Simpson index $S_1 = 0.6274$\n\nThese are presented as a row matrix $[H_0, S_0, H_1, S_1]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.030  0.6200  1.075  0.6274\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5071726"}]}
