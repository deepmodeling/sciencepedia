The core principle it invokes is the fundamental relationship in linear pharmacokinetics between dose, clearance, and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). The context of using busulfan with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a standard and well-documented clinical practice in translational medicine.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters to calculate the required doses. The given values for target exposure ($AUC_{total} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$) and clearance ($CL = 5\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$) are within a clinically realistic range for this therapeutic agent and patient population.\n\nThe problem is objective and uses precise, unambiguous terminology (e.g., \"linear pharmacokinetics,\" \"clearance,\" \"superposition\"). No information is missing or contradictory. The mention of intravenous administration is consistent with the assumption of complete bioavailability. The question is formalizable and directly relevant to the stated discipline.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe fundamental relationship in pharmacokinetics for a drug administered intravenously is that the area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$) for a single dose is equal to the dose administered divided by the drug's total body clearance ($CL$). The bioavailability factor, $F$, is equal to $1$ for intravenous administration.\n$$AUC_{single\\ dose} = \\frac{Dose_{single}}{CL}$$\nThe principle of superposition, which applies to drugs exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics, states that the total exposure from a multiple-dosing regimen is the sum of the exposures from each individual dose. Consequently, the total cumulative exposure ($AUC_{total}$) over the entire course of therapy is directly related to the total dose administered ($Dose_{total}$) and the clearance ($CL$).\n$$AUC_{total} = \\frac{Dose_{total}}{CL}$$\nThe problem requires finding the total dose ($Dose_{total}$) that achieves the target cumulative exposure ($AUC_{total}$). We can rearrange the equation to solve for $Dose_{total}$.\n$$Dose_{total} = AUC_{total} \\times CL$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Target cumulative exposure, $AUC_{total} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$\n- Patient's clearance, $CL = 5\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$Dose_{total} = (80\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}) \\times (5\\,\\mathrm{L/h})$$\nThe units of hours ($\\mathrm{h}$) and liters ($\\mathrm{L}$) cancel, yielding a result in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$).\n$$Dose_{total} = 400\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThis is the total amount of busulfan that must be administered over the entire course of therapy to achieve the target exposure.\n\nNext, the problem requires the calculation of the per-dose amount ($Dose_{per}$). The total dose is administered as $16$ equal doses. Therefore, the amount for each individual dose is the total dose divided by the number of doses ($N_{doses}$).\n$$Dose_{per} = \\frac{Dose_{total}}{N_{doses}}$$\nGiven:\n- Total dose, $Dose_{total} = 400\\ \\mathrm{mg}$\n- Number of doses, $N_{doses} = 16$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$Dose_{per} = \\frac{400\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{16}$$\n$$Dose_{per} = 25\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThus, the patient should receive a dose of $25\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ of busulfan every $6$ hours for a total of $16$ doses. The total dose administered will be $400\\ \\mathrm{mg}$, achieving the cumulative exposure target of $80\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the total dose and the per-dose amount, presented as a row vector as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 400 & 25 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5020357"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the conditioning regimen, the quality and quantity of the hematopoietic stem cell graft are paramount for successful engraftment.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of translational medicine, specifically hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the effective infused functional CD34$^{+}$ dose from first principles, calculate its value, and assess its adequacy against given clinical thresholds.\n\nLet $D_{pre}$ represent the pre-freeze quantified dose of CD34$^{+}$ cells per kilogram of recipient body weight. The problem provides this value as:\n$$D_{pre} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ cells/kg}$$\n\nLet $v$ be the post-thaw viable fraction of CD34$^{+}$ cells, which is given as:\n$$v = 0.85$$\n\nAccording to the problem's foundational facts, viability is modeled as the probability that any individual CD34$^{+}$ cell remains viable and functionally competent after thawing. Therefore, for a single cell randomly selected from the graft, the probability of it being viable is $p_{viable} = v$.\n\nThe effective infused functional CD34$^{+}$ dose, which we will denote as $D_{eff}$, is defined as the expected number of viable CD34$^{+}$ cells delivered per kilogram. To derive this from first principles, we consider the collection of $N = D_{pre}$ cells (per kilogram) prepared for infusion. Each cell's state after thawing (viable or non-viable) can be modeled as an independent Bernoulli trial. A \"success\" for a trial is the cell being viable, with a probability of success $p = v$.\n\nThe total number of viable cells per kilogram, let's call this random variable $X$, follows a binomial distribution $X \\sim B(N, p)$, where $N$ is the total number of trials (cells per kg) and $p$ is the probability of success (viability). The expected value, $E[X]$, of a binomially distributed random variable is given by the product of the number of trials and the probability of success:\n$$E[X] = N \\times p$$\n\nIn this context, $N$ corresponds to the pre-freeze dose $D_{pre}$, and $p$ corresponds to the viability fraction $v$. The effective dose $D_{eff}$ is, by definition, this expected value.\nTherefore, the expression for the effective infused functional CD34$^{+}$ dose is:\n$$D_{eff} = D_{pre} \\times v$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $D_{eff}$ using the provided data:\n$$D_{eff} = (5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ cells/kg}) \\times 0.85$$\n$$D_{eff} = 4.25 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ cells/kg}$$\n\nThe problem requires reporting this dose in units of $10^{6}$ cells/kg, rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value is $4.25 \\times 10^{6}$, which is already expressed to $3$ significant figures. The numerical value is $4.25$.\n\nNext, we assess this dose against the provided clinical thresholds for engraftment adequacy.\nThe minimum required functional dose is $D_{min} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}$ cells/kg.\nThe optimal target dose is $D_{opt} = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}$ cells/kg.\n\nWe compare our calculated effective dose, $D_{eff}$, to these thresholds.\n1.  **Assessment against the minimum threshold:**\n    We check if $D_{eff} \\geq D_{min}$.\n    $$4.25 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ cells/kg} \\geq 2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ cells/kg}$$\n    This inequality is true.
