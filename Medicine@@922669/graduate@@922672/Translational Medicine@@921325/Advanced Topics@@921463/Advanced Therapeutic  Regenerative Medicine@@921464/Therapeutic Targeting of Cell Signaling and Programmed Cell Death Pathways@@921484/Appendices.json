The problem specifies that binding reactions equilibrate rapidly, allowing us to use the equilibrium dissociation constants to describe the system. The two competitive binding reactions are:\n1.  $\\mathrm{FADD} + \\mathrm{C8} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}$ with dissociation constant $K_{d8}$.\n2.  $\\mathrm{FADD} + \\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{FADD{:}c\\text{-}FLIP}$ with dissociation constant $K_{dF}$.\n\nThe equilibrium expressions based on the law of mass action are:\n$$K_{d8} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}] [\\mathrm{C8}]}{[\\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}]}$$\n$$K_{dF} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}] [\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]}{[\\mathrm{FADD{:}c\\text{-}FLIP}]}$$\n\nFrom these equilibrium equations, we can express the concentrations of the two bound complexes in terms of the concentration of free FADD, $[\\mathrm{FADD}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}] [\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{FADD{:}c\\text{-}FLIP}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}] [\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]}{K_{dF}}$$\n\nThe total concentration of FADD, $[\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is conserved. It is the sum of free FADD and FADD bound in either of the two complexes:\n$$[\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [\\mathrm{FADD}] + [\\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}] + [\\mathrm{FADD{:}c\\text{-}FLIP}]$$\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for the concentrations of the bound complexes into the conservation law:\n$$[\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [\\mathrm{FADD}] + \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}] [\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}] [\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]}{K_{dF}}$$\n\nNow, we solve for the concentration of free FADD, $[\\mathrm{FADD}]$, by factoring it out from the right-hand side:\n$$[\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [\\mathrm{FADD}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]}{K_{dF}} \\right)$$\n$$[\\mathrm{FADD}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]}{K_{dF}}}$$\n\nWith the expression for free FADD, we can now find the steady-state concentration of the productive complex, $[\\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}] [\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} = \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]}{K_{dF}}} \\right) \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]}{K_{dF}}}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}]$ into the equation for the activation flux $R$. This yields the flux as a function of $[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]$ and the other system parameters:\n$$R = k_{\\mathrm{act}} [\\mathrm{FADD{:}C8}] = k_{\\mathrm{act}} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]}{K_{dF}}} \\right)$$\nThis is the required expression for the steady-state activation flux $R$. This equation correctly captures the competitive inhibition of procaspase-8 activation by c-FLIP.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to find the threshold concentration of c-FLIP, denoted $[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}}$, at which the activation flux $R$ equals a critical threshold $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. We set $R = R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and $[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}] = [\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ in the derived flux equation:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{act}} [\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}}}{K_{dF}}}$$\n\nOur objective is to solve this algebraic equation for $[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}}$. We begin by taking the reciprocal of both sides or by cross-multiplication:\n$$1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}}}{K_{dF}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{act}} [\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}}}{R_{\\mathrm{crit}}}$$\n\nNext, we isolate the term containing $[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}}$:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}}}{K_{dF}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{act}} [\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [\\mathrm{C8}]}{R_{\\mathrm{crit}} K_{d8}} - \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} \\right)$$\n\nFinally, we multiply the entire equation by $K_{dF}$ to obtain the final expression for $[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}}$:\n$$[\\mathrm{c\\text{-}FLIP}]_{\\mathrm{thr}} = K_{dF} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{act}} [\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [\\mathrm{C8}]}{R_{\\mathrm{crit}} K_{d8}} - 1 - \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} \\right)$$\n\nThis closed-form analytic expression provides the threshold concentration of the inhibitor c-FLIP required to reduce the caspase-8 activation flux to the critical level $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ in terms of the given biophysical and system parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{K_{dF} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{act}} [\\mathrm{FADD}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [\\mathrm{C8}]}{R_{\\mathrm{crit}} K_{d8}} - 1 - \\frac{[\\mathrm{C8}]}{K_{d8}} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "5072064"}]}
