The enhancer strength is a dimensionless quantity defined as the multiplicative factor by which the enhancer increases the transcription initiation rate relative to basal promoter activity. Assume the following fundamental base:\n- The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that gene expression involves transcription of DNA into messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) followed by translation, and for a single gene in a homogeneous cell population on the time scale of hours, the mRNA population dynamics are well approximated by a first-order birth–death process.\n- In this regime, the mRNA concentration $m(t)$ obeys $ \\frac{dm}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} m$, where $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ is the transcription initiation rate and $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ is the first-order mRNA degradation rate constant.\n- The transcription initiation rate is proportional to enhancer strength $S$ via $k_{\\mathrm{tx}} = k_{b} S$, where $k_{b}$ is a constant with units of concentration per unit time.\n\nLet $S_{h}$ denote the healthy enhancer strength. In the disease state, the enhancer strength is reduced by a fractional loss $ \\epsilon$ with $0  \\epsilon  1$, so that $S_{d} = (1 - \\epsilon) S_{h}$.

The derivation will begin by determining the steady-state messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) concentrations for the healthy, disease, and post-intervention states, based on the provided first-order model of gene expression dynamics.\n\nThe dynamics of the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$, are described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} m\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ is the transcription initiation rate and $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ is the mRNA degradation rate constant.\n\nAt steady state, the concentration of mRNA is constant, which implies that its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{dm}{dt} = 0$. Let $m^*$ denote the steady-state concentration. Setting the equation to zero yields:\n$$\n0 = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} m^*\n$$\nSolving for $m^*$, we obtain the general expression for the steady-state mRNA concentration:\n$$\nm^* = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the transcription rate $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ is proportional to the enhancer strength $S$ via the relation $k_{\\mathrm{tx}} = k_{b} S$, where $k_{b}$ is a constant. Substituting this into the expression for $m^*$ gives:\n$$\nm^* = \\frac{k_{b} S}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n$$\nThis equation establishes a direct proportionality between the steady-state mRNA concentration and the enhancer strength. We can now apply this general result to the three specific states defined in the problem: healthy, disease, and post-intervention.\n\n1.  **Healthy State:**\n    The enhancer strength is $S_{h}$. The corresponding steady-state mRNA concentration, $m_{h}^{*}$, is:\n    $$\n    m_{h}^{*} = \\frac{k_{b} S_{h}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Disease State:**\n    The enhancer strength is reduced to $S_{d} = (1 - \\epsilon) S_{h}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the fractional loss satisfying $0  \\epsilon  1$.

Immediately after editing at time $t=0$, all cells carry the mark. During subsequent symmetric divisions, maintenance of the mark in a given lineage is governed by the maintenance methyltransferase and is modeled as follows: in each division, the mark is preserved in a lineage with probability $p$, independently across divisions; there is no active demethylation, no re-editing, and once the mark is lost in a lineage, it is not reacquired. The culture is well-mixed and contains $2$ subpopulations that differ in chromatin state and therefore in maintenance efficiency: a euchromatic subpopulation with fraction $w_{E} = 0.7$ and per-division retention probability $p_{E} = 0.92$, and a heterochromatic subpopulation with fraction $w_{H} = 0.3$ and per-division retention probability $p_{H} = 0.98$.
