All required data and parameters are provided, the modeling assumptions (Bernoulli trials for sequencing, linear model for detection probability) are standard and appropriate for this context, and the objectives are clear. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientific fallacies. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an estimation of the true off-target editing fraction, $f$, and its use in comparing two gene editing strategies. The context is gene editing, a technology that modifies an organism's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The analysis of off-target effects relies on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to read the DNA sequence at potential off-target loci. This process is framed by the Central Dogma, as modifications to DNA can alter ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcripts and subsequent protein synthesis, leading to cellular-level consequences.\n\nFirst, we derive the estimator for the true off-target editing fraction, $f$. The problem specifies that the number of observed edit calls, $r$, in a set of $N$ independent NGS reads follows a binomial distribution. Each read is an independent Bernoulli trial where the \"success\" is calling an edit. The probability of success, $p(f)$, is a function of the true fraction of edited alleles, $f$, the assay's sensitivity (true positive rate), $\\eta$, and its false positive rate, $\\phi$.\n\nThe probability of calling an edit on a single read is the sum of two disjoint events: calling an edit on a truly edited allele and calling an edit on a truly unedited allele.\n$$p(f) = P(\\text{call edit} | \\text{truly edited})P(\\text{truly edited}) + P(\\text{call edit} | \\text{truly unedited})P(\\text{truly unedited})$$\nGiven the definitions, this is:\n$$p(f) = \\eta f + \\phi (1 - f)$$\nThis can be rearranged to $p(f) = (\\eta - \\phi)f + \\phi$.\n\nThe likelihood of observing $r$ edit calls in $N$ reads is given by the binomial probability mass function:\n$$L(f; N, r) = \\binom{N}{r} [p(f)]^r [1 - p(f)]^{N-r}$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for $f$, we maximize this function with respect to $f$. It is computationally simpler to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ln L(f)$:\n$$\\ln L(f) = \\ln\\binom{N}{r} + r \\ln(p(f)) + (N-r)\\ln(1 - p(f))$$\nWe find the maximum by taking the derivative with respect to $f$ and setting it to zero.\n$$\\frac{d}{df} \\ln L(f) = \\frac{r}{p(f)} \\frac{dp}{df} + \\frac{N-r}{1-p(f)} \\left(-\\frac{dp}{df}\\right) = 0$$\nThe derivative of $p(f)$ with respect to $f$ is:\n$$\\frac{dp}{df} = \\frac{d}{df} [(\\eta - \\phi)f + \\phi] = \\eta - \\phi$$\nSubstituting this into the equation and assuming $\\eta \\neq \\phi$:\n$$\\left( \\frac{r}{p(f)} - \\frac{N-r}{1-p(f)} \\right)(\\eta - \\phi) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{r}{p(f)} = \\frac{N-r}{1-p(f)}$$\n$$r(1 - p(f)) = (N-r)p(f)$$\n$$r - r \\cdot p(f) = N \\cdot p(f) - r \\cdot p(f)$$\n$$r = N \\cdot p(f)$$\nThis yields the MLE for the probability $p(f)$, denoted $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{r}{N}$$\nNow, we substitute this estimate back into the equation for $p(f)$ to solve for the estimator of $f$, denoted $\\hat{f}$:\n$$\\frac{r}{N} = (\\eta - \\phi)\\hat{f} + \\phi$$\n$$\\frac{r}{N} - \\phi = (\\eta - \\phi)\\hat{f}$$\nThe estimator for the true off-target editing fraction is therefore:\n$$\\hat{f} = \\frac{\\frac{r}{N} - \\phi}{\\eta - \\phi}$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\hat{f}$ using the provided data: $\\eta = 0.90$, $\\phi = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, $N = 10,000$, and $r = 12$.\nThe observed frequency of edit calls is:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{r}{N} = \\frac{12}{10,000} = 0.0012$$\nSubstituting the values into the estimator for $f$:\n$$\\hat{f} = \\frac{0.0012 - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.90 - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{0.0012 - 0.0001}{0.90 - 0.0001} = \\frac{0.0011}{0.8999}$$\nWe will retain this exact fractional form for subsequent calculations to avoid premature rounding errors.\n\nThe problem asks to compute the expected reduction in off-target edited cells, $D$, defined as:\n$$D = M \\hat{f} - N_{\\mathrm{trans}} (1 - \\sigma) \\rho \\hat{f}$$\nWe can factor out $\\hat{f}$:\n$$D = \\left[ M - N_{\\mathrm{trans}} (1 - \\sigma) \\rho \\right] \\hat{f}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$M = 1.2 \\times 10^{8}$\n$N_{\\mathrm{trans}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6}$\n$\\sigma = 0.92$\n$\\rho = 0.35$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the coefficient of $\\hat{f}$:\n$$1 - \\sigma = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{trans}} (1 - \\sigma) \\rho = (5.0 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (0.08) \\times (0.35) = 140,000 = 1.4 \\times 10^{5}$$\n$$M - N_{\\mathrm{trans}} (1 - \\sigma) \\rho = 1.2 \\times 10^{8} - 1.4 \\times 10^{5} = 120,000,000 - 140,000 = 119,860,000$$\nNow, we can compute $D$:\n$$D = (119,860,000) \\times \\hat{f} = (119,860,000) \\times \\frac{0.0011}{0.8999}$$\n$$D = \\frac{131,846}{0.8999} \\approx 146511.834648$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Assume the following fundamental and widely used bases: integration events per cell are well-modeled as independent Poisson processes, and integration sites are uniformly random across the haploid genome. A cell becomes genotoxic-hazardous if at least one integration lands in a promoter-proximal window around a high-risk proto-oncogene and the insertional context is activating. Specifically, suppose there are $G$ high-risk proto-oncogenes, each with a bidirectional promoter-proximal window of width $2w$, and that conditional on landing in such a window the probability of activation is $\\beta$. The haploid genome length is $L$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and probability theory, well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and objective in its language.

The number of integrations per cell, $K$, follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$, i.e., $P(K=k) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu} \\mu^k}{k!}$. A cell is hazardous if at least one integration is hazardous. The probability that a cell with $k$ integrations is *not* hazardous is $(1 - p_{\\mathrm{int}})^k$, assuming independence of each integration event.

This is the probability that at least one of the $N_{\\mathrm{in}}$ transduced cells is hazardous. The probability that all $N_{\\mathrm{in}}$ cells are safe is $(p_{\\text{safe-cell}})^{N_{\\mathrm{in}}}$, assuming independence across cells.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{in}} = 1 - (p_{\\text{safe-cell}})^{N_{\\mathrm{in}}} = 1 - (\\exp(-\\mu_{\\mathrm{in}} p_{\\mathrm{int}}))^{N_{\\mathrm{in}}} = 1 - \\exp(-N_{\\mathrm{in}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{in}} p_{\\mathrm{int}}) $$\nThe exponent, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} = N_{\\mathrm{in}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{in}} p_{\\mathrm{int}}$, represents the expected total number of hazardous integrations in the patient.\nSubstituting the values for the *in vivo* strategy: $N_{\\mathrm{in}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.01$.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (0.01) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) = 0.1 $$\nThus, the *in vivo* risk is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{in}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.1) $$\n\nFor the *ex vivo* strategy, we must account for the quality control screening.
