It is based on fundamental principles of equilibrium chemistry (the Law of Mass Action) as applied to a standard biochemical model of receptor-ligand binding (the Langmuir isotherm). All necessary definitions, constants, and conditions are provided to derive the required expression and compute the numerical result. The parameters given are realistic for the biological context of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell interactions. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe primary goal is to derive an expression for the bound fraction, $f$, in terms of the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_D$. The provided definitions are:\n1.  Equilibrium reaction: $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$\n2.  Dissociation constant: $K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$\n3.  Total receptor concentration: $R_T = [R] + [RL]$\n4.  Bound fraction: $f = \\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$\n\nWe begin with the definition of the bound fraction, $f$.\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$$\nSubstitute the definition of $R_T$ into this equation:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nOur goal is to express $f$ using only $[L]$ and $K_D$. To do this, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RL]$. We can achieve this by expressing one in terms of the other and simplifying. Let us rearrange the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_D$, to solve for the free receptor concentration, $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into our equation for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}$$\nThe term $[RL]$ is a common factor in the denominator. We can factor it out:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left(\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1\\right)}$$\nAssuming that some binding occurs ($[RL] > 0$), we can cancel the $[RL]$ term from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify the compound fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n$$f = \\frac{1 \\cdot [L]}{\\left(\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1\\right) \\cdot [L]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}$$\nThis is the final derived expression for the bound fraction $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$. This is a form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a Hill coefficient of $1$.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the numerical value of $f$ given $[L] = 10\\,\\text{nM}$ and $K_D = 100\\,\\text{nM}$. We substitute these values into our derived expression:\n$$f = \\frac{10\\,\\text{nM}}{100\\,\\text{nM} + 10\\,\\text{nM}}$$\nThe units of concentration (nM) cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless fraction:\n$$f = \\frac{10}{110} = \\frac{1}{11}$$\nTo provide a decimal answer rounded to three significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{11} \\approx 0.09090909...$$\nRounding to three significant figures yields:\n$$f \\approx 0.0909$$\n\nFor the interpretive part of the question, we first calculate the number of engaged receptors, $N_{\\text{eng}}$, per cell.

T cell activation requires a signal to surpass a certain threshold. This threshold is not a fixed number of engaged receptors but is modulated by several factors. In a \"high-avidity context\" with CARs, several principles apply:\n1.  **Multivalency**: High avidity implies that multiple CARs on the T cell surface are binding to multiple ligands on a target cell, creating a stable immunological synapse. This is a much more potent stimulus than binding to a soluble, monomeric ligand.\n2.  **Signal Integration and Amplification**: CARs cluster into micro-domains upon binding, concentrating signaling molecules and amplifying the downstream signal from each engaged receptor.\n3.  **Costimulation**: The intracellular domains (e.g., from CD28 or 4-1BB) in modern CARs provide costimulatory signals that are essential for full T cell activation and significantly lower the activation threshold compared to T-cell receptors (TCRs) alone.\n\nGiven these principles, the engagement of approximately $4500$ receptors is well above the minimal numbers often cited for T cell activation (which can be as low as a few dozen to a few hundred under optimal conditions). Even though the fractional occupancy is low (approximately $9.1\\%$), the absolute number of engaged receptors, amplified by the high-avidity binding environment and engineered costimulation, makes it highly plausible that this level of occupancy is sufficient to trigger robust CAR-T cell activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0909}$$", "id": "5005577"}, {"introduction": "A critical challenge in CAR design is achieving selectivity for tumors while sparing healthy tissues that may express the same antigen at lower levels.

It is based on established principles of receptor-ligand binding kinetics and their application to a realistic problem in translational immunotherapy. All necessary data and definitions are provided to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe foundational principle for this problem is the law of mass action applied to a reversible receptor-ligand binding event. For a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR), denoted $C$, binding to its target antigen, $A$, the equilibrium is described by:\n$$\nC + A \\rightleftharpoons CA\n$$\nwhere $CA$ is the bound complex.

Under this approximation, the denominator of the fractional occupancy equation simplifies to $[A] + K_D \\approx K_D$. The fractional occupancy becomes:\n$$\n\\theta \\approx \\frac{[A]}{K_D}\n$$\nThe selectivity ratio $S$ is the ratio of $\\theta_{\\mathrm{tumor}}$ to $\\theta_{\\mathrm{healthy}}$ at an identical antigen concentration $[A]$ in this linear regime.\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{tumor}}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{healthy}}} = \\frac{[A]/K_D^{\\mathrm{tumor}}}{[A]/K_D^{\\mathrm{healthy}}}\n$$\nThe antigen concentration $[A]$ cancels, yielding a selectivity ratio that depends only on the dissociation constants:\n$$\nS = \\frac{K_D^{\\mathrm{healthy}}}{K_D^{\\mathrm{tumor}}}\n$$\nUsing the provided values, $K_D^{\\mathrm{tumor}} = 3.7\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_D^{\\mathrm{healthy}} = 135\\,\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{135}{3.7} \\approx 36.486486...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the binding selectivity ratio is $36.5$. This dimensionless number indicates that, in the low-antigen limit, the CAR is approximately $36.5$ times more likely to be bound in the acidic tumor environment than in the neutral healthy tissue environment for the same antigen concentration.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an assessment of whether this selectivity is sufficient for differential activation, given specific antigen concentrations and an activation threshold. For this analysis, we must use the full, non-approximated equation for fractional occupancy, as the antigen concentrations may not be in the linear regime. The activation threshold is given as $\\theta^{\\ast} = 0.10$.\n\nIn the tumor context:\nThe antigen concentration is $[A]_{\\mathrm{tumor}} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and the dissociation constant is $K_D^{\\mathrm{tumor}} = 3.7\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.

Therefore, robust activation of the CAR T-cells is expected in the tumor microenvironment.\n\nIn the healthy tissue context:\nThe antigen concentration is $[A]_{\\mathrm{healthy}} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and the dissociation constant is $K_D^{\\mathrm{healthy}} = 135\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. The fractional occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{healthy}} = \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{healthy}}}{[A]_{\\mathrm{healthy}} + K_D^{\\mathrm{healthy}}} = \\frac{0.50}{0.50 + 135} = \\frac{0.50}{135.5} \\approx 0.00369\n$$\nThis fractional occupancy, approximately $0.0037$, is substantially less than the activation threshold $\\theta^{\\ast} = 0.10$. Therefore, the CAR T-cells are not expected to be activated in healthy tissue, achieving the goal of \"off-tumor sparing.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of pH-dependent affinity tuning and the differing antigen concentrations between tumor and healthy tissues creates a scenario where the CAR T-cell is predicted to be active on the tumor ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{tumor}} > \\theta^{\\ast}$) but quiescent in healthy tissue ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{healthy}} < \\theta^{\\ast}$).

One design implements logical OR gating by co-expressing two single-input CARs that each independently deliver full activation upon engagement with their cognate antigen. The second implements logical AND gating by splitting activation and costimulation across two receptors such that both inputs must be engaged on the same target cell to elicit full activation. Consider a tumor in which antigen $A$ is heterogeneously expressed and antigen $B$ is sparse. Empirical profiling indicates that a fraction $p$ of tumor cells expresses $A$ at high density while the remaining tumor cells have negligible $A$.

It asks for a comparison of these designs, yielding a unique, meaningful solution. A minor ambiguity exists regarding the density of antigen $B$ on normal cells. The problem states a fraction $r$ of normal cells express $B$, but not the density. However, the options refer to activation on these cells, implying the density is sufficient to trigger the $B$-specific CAR. A reasonable and necessary assumption is that the density of $B$ on normal cells is at least the threshold $n_B^{\\ast}$. Given the provided values ($n_B^{\\mathrm{lo}} > n_B^{\\ast}$), it is plausible to assume normal\n$B$-positive cells have a density of $n_B^{\\mathrm{lo}}$ or another value greater than $n_B^{\\ast}$. With this standard assumption, the problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative. The question asks for a prediction based on \"basic probability and receptor-threshold reasoning\" from the given data, making it entirely objective.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete (with a minor, resolvable assumption), realistic, well-structured, and non-trivial.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires calculating the fraction of tumor cells and normal cells that will be targeted by each of the two CAR-T cell designs.\n\n**1. Determine CAR Input Activation Conditions**\n\nFirst, we verify if the antigen densities on positive cells are sufficient to trigger the respective CARs.\n- For antigen $A$: The density on $A$-positive tumor cells is $n_A^{\\mathrm{hi}}=1.0\\times 10^5$ molecules/cell. The activation threshold is $n_A^{\\ast}=5.0\\times 10^4$ molecules/cell. Since $n_A^{\\mathrm{hi}} > n_A^{\\ast}$, any tumor cell expressing antigen $A$ will trigger the $A$-specific CAR input.\n- For antigen $B$: The density on $B$-positive tumor cells is $n_B^{\\mathrm{lo}}=3.0\\times 10^4$ molecules/cell. The activation threshold is $n_B^{\\ast}=2.0\\times 10^4$ molecules/cell. Since $n_B^{\\mathrm{lo}} > n_B^{\\ast}$, any tumor cell expressing antigen $B$ will trigger the $B$-specific CAR input.\n- For normal cells: Normal cells are $A$-negative. A fraction $r=0.2$ are $B$-positive. We assume the density of $B$ on these normal cells is sufficient to trigger the $B$-specific CAR, i.e., greater than $n_B^{\\ast}$.\n\nLet $S_A$ be the event that a cell triggers the $A$-specific CAR input and $S_B$ be the event that a cell triggers the $B$-specific CAR input. Based on the above, for a tumor cell, $S_A$ is equivalent to being $A$-positive, and $S_B$ is equivalent to being $B$-positive.\n\n**2. Characterize Tumor Cell Populations**\n\nThe expression of antigens $A$ and $B$ on tumor cells is independent. The probabilities of a tumor cell expressing these antigens are given as $P(A) = p = 0.6$ and $P(B) = q = 0.3$. We can calculate the fractions of the four possible subpopulations of tumor cells:\n- Fraction of $A^{+}B^{+}$ cells: $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B) = pq = (0.6)(0.3) = 0.18$.\n- Fraction of $A^{+}B^{-}$ cells: $P(A \\cap B^c) = P(A)P(B^c) = p(1-q) = (0.6)(1-0.3) = 0.42$.\n- Fraction of $A^{-}B^{+}$ cells: $P(A^c \\cap B) = P(A^c)P(B) = (1-p)q = (1-0.6)(0.3) = 0.12$.\n- Fraction of $A^{-}B^{-}$ cells: $P(A^c \\cap B^c) = P(A^c)P(B^c) = (1-p)(1-q) = (0.4)(0.7) = 0.28$.\nThe sum of these fractions is $0.18 + 0.42 + 0.12 + 0.28 = 1.0$, as expected.\n\n**3. Analyze the OR-Gated CAR Design**\n\nThe OR-gated CAR T-cell is activated if it encounters a cell that triggers a response through the $A$-specific CAR **OR** the $B$-specific CAR.\n- **On-Tumor Activation**: The CAR activates on tumor cells that are $A^{+}$ or $B^{+}$. The fraction of such cells is given by the probability of the union of events $A$ and $B$.\n$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$$\n$$P(A \\cup B) = p + q - pq = 0.6 + 0.3 - 0.18 = 0.72$$\nAlternatively, this is the complement of the $A^{-}B^{-}$ population: $1 - P(A^c \\cap B^c) = 1 - 0.28 = 0.72$.\nThus, the OR-gated CAR will activate on approximately $72\\%$ of tumor cells.\n\n- **Off-Tumor Activation (Risk)**: Normal tissues are $A^{-}$. Activation can only occur if the cells are $B^{+}$. A fraction $r=0.2$ of normal cells are $B^{+}$. Assuming their $B$ antigen density is above the threshold $n_B^{\\ast}$, the OR-gated CAR will activate on this subset of normal cells.\n\n**4. Analyze the AND-Gated CAR Design**\n\nThe AND-gated CAR T-cell is activated only if it encounters a cell that triggers a response through the $A$-specific CAR **AND** the $B$-specific CAR simultaneously.\n- **On-Tumor Activation**: The CAR activates only on tumor cells that are both $A^{+}$ and $B^{+}$. The fraction of such cells is given by the probability of the intersection of events $A$ and $B$.\n$$P(A \\cap B) = pq = (0.6)(0.3) = 0.18$$\nThus, the AND-gated CAR will activate on approximately $18\\%$ of tumor cells.\n\n- **Off-Tumor Activation (Risk)**: Activation requires cells to be $A^{+}$ and $B^{+}$. However, all normal tissue cells are stated to be $A^{-}$. Therefore, no normal cell can satisfy the $A^{+}B^{+}$ condition.\nThe AND-gated CAR will not activate on any of the specified normal cells, meaning it will spare them.\n\n**5. Summary of Predictions**\n- **OR-gated CAR**: Activates on $72\\%$ of tumor cells. Presents off-tumor activation risk on the $20\\%$ of normal cells that are $B^{+}$.\n- **AND-gated CAR**: Activates on $18\\%$ of tumor cells. Provides high safety, sparing normal cells (including the $B^{+}$ subset).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A.
