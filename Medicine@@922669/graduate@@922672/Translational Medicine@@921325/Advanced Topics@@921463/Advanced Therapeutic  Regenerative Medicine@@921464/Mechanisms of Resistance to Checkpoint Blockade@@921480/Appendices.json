By quantifying the fraction of occupied receptors, you will explore how even clinically relevant drug concentrations leave a small percentage of receptors free, potentially allowing for residual inhibitory signaling and contributing to intrinsic resistance.", "problem": "A fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) is administered at a steady plasma concentration. Consider the equilibrium binding of a monovalent antibody (ligand) to a monovalent PD-1 receptor on T cells under the following assumptions: (i) classical $1\\!:\\!1$ reversible binding at equilibrium, (ii) the antibody is present in vast excess over total PD-1 so that depletion of free antibody by binding is negligible, and (iii) no avidity, crosslinking, or downstream effects alter the intrinsic binding affinity. The dissociation constant $K_{d}$ is defined by the law of mass action as $K_{d} = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]}$, where $[L]$ is the free antibody concentration, $[R]$ is the free receptor concentration, and $[LR]$ is the ligand–receptor complex concentration.

Your final numerical answer must be the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ under the stated conditions.", "solution": "The objective is to derive an expression for receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, based on fundamental principles of ligand-receptor binding, calculate its value for the given parameters, and provide a mechanistic interpretation in the context of resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy.\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions and assumptions for a monovalent ligand ($L$) binding to a monovalent receptor ($R$):\n1.  The law of mass action for reversible binding at equilibrium defines the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$:\n    $$K_{d} = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]}$$\n    where $[L]$ is the free ligand concentration, $[R]$ is the free receptor concentration, and $[LR]$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex.\n\n2.  The total receptor concentration, $[R]_{T}$, is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n    $$[R]_{T} = [R] + [LR]$$\n\n3.  Receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand:\n    $$\\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{T}}$$\n\n4.  The free ligand concentration, $[L]$, is assumed to be constant and equal to the administered plasma concentration, $C$, due to the vast excess of ligand relative to the total number of receptors. Thus, $[L] = C$.\n\nOur first task is to derive an expression for $\\theta$ in terms of $C$ and $K_{d}$. We begin by expressing $[R]$ in terms of $[R]_{T}$ and $[LR]$ using the definition of total receptor concentration:\n$$[R] = [R]_{T} - [LR]$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[L]([R]_{T} - [LR])}{[LR]}$$\n\nThe goal is to isolate the ratio $\\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{T}}$, which is defined as $\\theta$. We rearrange the equation algebraically:\n$$K_{d} [LR] = [L]([R]_{T} - [LR])$$\n$$K_{d} [LR] = [L][R]_{T} - [L][LR]$$\n\nNow, we gather all terms containing $[LR]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$K_{d} [LR] + [L][LR] = [L][R]_{T}$$\n\nFactor out $[LR]$ from the left side:\n$$[LR](K_{d} + [L]) = [L][R]_{T}$$\n\nTo obtain the expression for $\\theta$, we divide both sides by $[R]_{T}$ and by $(K_{d} + [L])$:\n$$\\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{T}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\n\nSubstituting the definitions $\\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{T}}$ and the assumption $[L] = C$, we arrive at the desired expression for receptor occupancy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{C}{K_{d} + C}$$\nThis is a form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for $1:1$ binding.\n\nThe second task is to compute the value of $\\theta$ for a free antibody concentration $C = 10 \\text{ nM}$ and a dissociation constant $K_{d} = 1 \\text{ nM}$. We substitute these values into our derived expression:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{10 \\text{ nM}}{1 \\text{ nM} + 10 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{10}{11}$$\nThe units of concentration (nM) cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction as required.\n\nThe final task is to provide a mechanistic justification for how less-than-complete occupancy can contribute to clinical resistance. The calculated occupancy is $\\theta = \\frac{10}{11} \\approx 0.909$, which corresponds to approximately $90.9\\%$ of PD-1 receptors being blocked by the antibody at equilibrium. Critically, this means that $1 - \\theta = 1 - \\frac{10}{11} = \\frac{1}{11}$, or approximately $9.1\\%$, of the PD-1 receptors on the T-cell surface remain unbound and available.\n\nThe therapeutic antibody acts as a competitive antagonist, blocking the binding of the natural inhibitory ligand, PD-L1, to the PD-1 receptor. The function of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis is to provide an inhibitory signal that attenuates T-cell activation. The degree of this inhibition is dependent on the number of PD-1 receptors engaged by PD-L1.\n\nEven with a high occupancy of $\\theta \\approx 0.909$, the remaining fraction of unoccupied receptors ($[R] = (1-\\theta)[R]_T$) can still bind PD-L1. If the concentration of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment is sufficiently high, or if the cell requires near-complete abrogation of the inhibitory signal to become fully active, the residual signaling through the small fraction of unbound PD-1 receptors can be enough to maintain a state of T-cell dysfunction. This constitutes a fundamental mechanism of primary resistance: the drug is binding its target as designed, but the equilibrium nature of the interaction, as described by the law of mass action, makes it quantitatively impossible to achieve $100\\%$ receptor occupancy at any finite drug concentration. The residual signaling capacity permitted by incomplete receptor blockade can be sufficient to prevent a robust anti-tumor immune response, leading to clinical resistance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}$$", "id": "5031281"}, {"introduction": "For checkpoint blockade to be effective, T cells must recognize cancer cells as foreign, a process that hinges on the presentation of tumor-specific peptides, or neoantigens.

For this to happen, both $B_i$ and $E_i$ must occur. Since these events are independent, the probability of $S_i$, which we denote as $p$, is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$p = P(S_i) = P(B_i \\cap E_i) = P(B_i) \\times P(E_i)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$p = 0.30 \\times 0.50 = 0.15$$\nThis probability $p$ represents the probability of \"success\" for a single trial (i.e., for a single mutation to result in a presented neoepitope).\n\nTo find the expected total number of presented neoepitopes, we can define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each mutation $i$:\n$$X_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if event } S_i \\text{ occurs (success)} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if event } S_i \\text{ does not occur (failure)} \\end{cases}$$\nEach $X_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p = 0.15$.

Under immune pressure, a copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity event at HLA-A is observed in a fraction $0.60$ of tumor cells. In these $0.60$ of tumor cells, immune selection has favored duplication of $A_{Y}$ and loss of $A_{X}$, so these cells cannot present the neoantigen to the TCR.
