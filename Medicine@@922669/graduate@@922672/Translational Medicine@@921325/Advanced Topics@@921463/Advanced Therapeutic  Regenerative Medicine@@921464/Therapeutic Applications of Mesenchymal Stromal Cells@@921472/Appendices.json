It presents a clear, quantitative task based on standard practices in translational medicine and cell therapy. All necessary parameters are defined and given, with no ambiguities or contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nLet $W$ be the patient's body weight, $D_{target}$ be the target viable cell dose per kilogram of body weight, $C_{req}$ be the total required number of viable cells for the patient, $N_{vial}$ be the nominal cell count per vial, $V_f$ be the viability fraction at administration, and $C_{vial}$ be the total number of viable cells per vial. We are asked to find the smallest integer number of vials, denoted by $n$, that meets or exceeds the required dose.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the total required viable cell count is defined as the product of the per-kilogram dose and the patient's body weight:\n$$C_{req} = D_{target} \\times W$$\nThe number of viable cells in a single vial is defined as the product of the nominal cell count per vial and the viability fraction:\n$$C_{vial} = N_{vial} \\times V_f$$\nThe total number of viable cells administered to the patient is the product of the number of vials, $n$, and the number of viable cells per vial, $C_{vial}$. The clinical protocol requires that this total administered dose meets or exceeds the total required dose. This is expressed as the following inequality:\n$$n \\times C_{vial} \\ge C_{req}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_{req}$ and $C_{vial}$ into the inequality, we obtain:\n$$n \\times (N_{vial} \\times V_f) \\ge D_{target} \\times W$$\nTo find the minimum number of vials, we must solve for $n$:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{D_{target} \\times W}{N_{vial} \\times V_f}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Patient weight, $W = 90 \\text{ kg}$\n- Target dose, $D_{target} = 1.5 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ cells/kg}$\n- Nominal cells per vial, $N_{vial} = 50 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ cells}$\n- Viability fraction, $V_f = 85\\% = 0.85$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total required number of viable cells, $C_{req}$:\n$$C_{req} = (1.5 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 90 = 135 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ viable cells}$$\nNext, we calculate the number of viable cells per vial, $C_{vial}$:\n$$C_{vial} = (50 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 0.85 = 42.5 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ viable cells}$$\nNow we substitute these calculated values back into the inequality for $n$:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{135 \\times 10^{6}}{42.5 \\times 10^{6}}$$\nThe factor of $10^6$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{135}{42.5}$$\nTo facilitate the division, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $2$ to remove the decimal:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{270}{85}$$\nThe greatest common divisor of $270$ and $85$ is $5$.

This exercise [@problem_id:5071071] challenges you to think like a research scientist by interpreting the results of a hypothetical experiment designed to dissect the MoA, using enzymatic and chemical treatments to distinguish between protein- and EV-encapsulated RNA-driven effects.", "problem": "A translational program is developing a mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived biologic centered on the secretome, operationalized as MSC-conditioned medium (MSC-CM). A qualified in vitro potency assay quantifies suppression of activated T-cell proliferation, reporting a potency metric $P$ defined as percent inhibition relative to an untreated T-cell control. In a reference batch, untreated MSC-CM yields $P_0 = 60\\%$. To dissect the relative contribution of ribonucleic acid (RNA) versus protein cargo, investigators plan mechanism-of-action probing treatments of MSC-CM before testing potency. Treatments include ribonuclease (RNase) to degrade RNA, protease to degrade proteins, and a mild nonionic detergent to permeabilize lipid bilayers of extracellular vesicles (EVs). After treatment, enzymes and detergent are removed by ultrafiltration into assay buffer to avoid carryover to responder cells. Heat-inactivated enzyme controls are included. Assume the following widely accepted starting points: the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology links RNA and protein to function; RNase degrades accessible RNA; protease degrades accessible protein; and intact EV lipid bilayers shield luminal cargo from enzymatic degradation unless membranes are permeabilized.\n\nYou conduct six pre-treatments of the same MSC-CM batch: untreated; RNase alone; protease alone; RNase plus detergent; protease plus detergent; and heat-inactivated RNase plus detergent. For each, you then measure $P$ in the T-cell assay as percent inhibition relative to untreated T-cell control. Which pattern of outcomes most strongly supports that the dominant driver of $P$ in this system is small RNA cargo encapsulated within extracellular vesicles rather than soluble protein factors?\n\nChoose the single best option.

Ribonuclease (RNase) hydrolyzes RNA that is physically accessible; protease hydrolyzes protein that is physically accessible. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), bounded by a lipid bilayer, protect luminal cargo such as microRNA from extracellular enzymes. Mild nonionic detergents permeabilize or solubilize lipid bilayers, thereby exposing luminal EV cargo to enzymatic degradation. Heat inactivation abolishes enzymatic activity and thus serves as a control for non-specific effects of the treatment workflow.\n\nIf the dominant driver of potency $P$ is an EV-encapsulated RNA (for example, microRNA) that reprograms responder T-cells or accessory cells, then we predict:\n\n1. RNase alone will have minimal effect, because intact EV membranes shield luminal RNA from RNase; thus $P$ should remain near $P_0 \\approx 60\\%$.\n2. Protease alone will have minimal effect, because the active species is RNA, not protein; thus $P \\approx P_0$ within experimental variation.\n3. RNase plus detergent will abolish potency, because detergent permeabilization exposes luminal EV RNA to RNase, degrading the active RNA; thus $P \\rightarrow$ low values (near $0\\text{–}10\\%$).\n4. Protease plus detergent will have minimal effect if proteins are not the dominant driver; while protease may degrade EV-associated membrane proteins, the RNA-driven mechanism remains intact; thus $P \\approx P_0$.\n5. Heat-inactivated RNase plus detergent will have minimal effect, because inactive enzyme cannot degrade RNA even if EVs are permeabilized; thus $P \\approx P_0$.\n\nConversely, if soluble proteins are the dominant drivers of $P$, RNase would have minimal effect with or without detergent, while protease would abolish $P$ with or without detergent, because soluble proteins are directly accessible and not protected by EV bilayers. If both RNA and proteins contribute materially, then degrading either class would partially reduce $P$, with combined accessibility (via detergent) further reducing $P$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these mechanistic predictions.\n\nOption A: $60\\%$; $58\\text{–}62\\%$; $58\\text{–}62\\%$; $0\\text{–}10\\%$; $55\\text{–}65\\%$; $55\\text{–}65\\%$.\n- Untreated $P \\approx 60\\%$ establishes the reference.\n- RNase alone leaves $P$ near $P_0$, consistent with EV-shielded RNA.\n- Protease alone leaves $P$ near $P_0$, consistent with a non-protein driver.\n- RNase plus detergent collapses $P$ to $0\\text{–}10\\%$, indicating the active moiety becomes susceptible upon EV membrane permeabilization, consistent with luminal RNA.\n- Protease plus detergent leaves $P$ near $P_0$, consistent with RNA-driven activity unaffected by proteolysis.\n- Heat-inactivated RNase plus detergent leaves $P$ near $P_0$, confirming loss of potency in the RNase plus detergent condition is enzyme-activity dependent.\nVerdict: Correct. This pattern most strongly supports an EV-encapsulated RNA driver.\n\nOption B: $60\\%$; $55\\text{–}65\\%$; $0\\text{–}10\\%$; $55\\text{–}65\\%$; $0\\text{–}10\\%$; $55\\text{–}65\\%$.\n- Protease alone and protease plus detergent both abolish potency, while RNase has no effect with or without detergent. This pattern is characteristic of a soluble protein driver, because soluble proteins are readily accessible to protease without needing detergent.\nVerdict: Incorrect for an RNA-in-EV dominant mechanism; instead, it supports a protein-driven mechanism.\n\nOption C: $60\\%$; $25\\text{–}35\\%$; $25\\text{–}35\\%$; $10\\text{–}20\\%$; $10\\text{–}20\\%$; $55\\text{–}65\\%$.\n- Partial loss of potency with either RNase or protease alone suggests both RNA and protein contribute. Further reduction with detergent suggests that additional protected cargo (RNA and/or protein) becomes accessible upon EV permeabilization. This is consistent with a mixed mechanism, not a dominant EV-encapsulated RNA mechanism.\nVerdict: Incorrect for the stated hypothesis; it supports mixed contributions.\n\nOption D: $60\\%$; $0\\text{–}10\\%$; $0\\text{–}10\\%$; $0\\text{–}10\\%$; $0\\text{–}10\\%$; $0\\text{–}10\\%$.\n- Near-complete loss of potency with all active and heat-inactivated enzyme conditions, with or without detergent, suggests nonspecific destruction of activity or assay interference (for example, residual detergent or process-related damage), not a mechanism-specific effect.\nVerdict: Incorrect and non-informative with respect to EV-encapsulated RNA dominance.\n\nTherefore, the pattern in Option A most strongly supports that the dominant driver of potency is small RNA cargo encapsulated within extracellular vesicles.\n\nAdditional translational considerations: The inclusion of heat-inactivated enzyme controls and post-treatment removal of enzymes and detergent mitigate confounding by residual enzymatic or detergent toxicity to responder cells.
