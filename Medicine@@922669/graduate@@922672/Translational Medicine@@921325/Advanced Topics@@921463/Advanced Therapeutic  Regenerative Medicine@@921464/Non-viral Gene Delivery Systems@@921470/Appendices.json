It is the ratio of the nanoparticle's steady-state drift velocity, $v_p$, to the magnitude of the applied external electric field, $E$:\n$$ \\mu_e = \\frac{v_p}{E} $$\nThe system involves a charged spherical particle of radius $R$ suspended in an electrolyte solution. The application of an external electric field $E$ exerts a force on the charges within the electrical double layer (EDL) that surrounds the particle. This leads to the motion of the fluid relative to the particle (electro-osmosis) and, by action-reaction, the motion of the particle relative to the bulk fluid (electrophoresis). At steady state, the electric driving force is precisely balanced by the viscous drag force of the medium.\n\nThe problem specifies that the condition of a thin double layer is met, where the Debye length, $\\kappa^{-1}$, is much smaller than the particle radius, $R$. This is also known as the Smoluchowski limit, where $\\kappa R \\gg 1$. In this scenario, the EDL is sufficiently thin that the particle's surface can be modeled as locally flat. This simplifies the electrohydrodynamic problem to that of an electro-osmotic flow adjacent to a charged planar surface.\n\nWe establish a local coordinate system at the particle's shear plane. Let the $y$-axis be normal to this plane, pointing into the electrolyte, and the $x$-axis be parallel to the plane and aligned with the direction of the external electric field $E$. In this planar approximation, the fluid velocity parallel to the surface, $v_x(y)$, and the electrostatic potential, $\\psi(y)$, are functions only of the distance $y$ from the shear plane.\n\nThe steady-state force balance on a differential volume element of the fluid within the EDL equates the electric body force and the viscous force, described by the Stokes equation:\n$$ \\eta \\frac{d^2 v_x(y)}{dy^2} + \\rho_e(y) E = 0 $$\nHere, $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the medium, and $\\rho_e(y)$ is the local volume charge density at position $y$.\n\nThe relationship between the charge density $\\rho_e(y)$ and the electrostatic potential $\\psi(y)$ is given by the one-dimensional Poisson equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\psi(y)}{dy^2} = -\\frac{\\rho_e(y)}{\\varepsilon} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r$ is the absolute permittivity of the medium, with $\\varepsilon_0$ being the vacuum permittivity and $\\varepsilon_r$ the relative permittivity.\n\nBy substituting $\\rho_e(y)$ from the Poisson equation into the force balance equation, we obtain:\n$$ \\eta \\frac{d^2 v_x(y)}{dy^2} - \\varepsilon E \\frac{d^2 \\psi(y)}{dy^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation can be integrated once with respect to $y$, yielding:\n$$ \\eta \\frac{d v_x(y)}{dy} - \\varepsilon E \\frac{d \\psi(y)}{dy} = C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. To determine $C_1$, we apply the boundary condition that far from the particle surface (as $y \\to \\infty$), the fluid is not sheared and the electric field from the particle's surface charge has decayed. Thus, $\\frac{dv_x}{dy} \\to 0$ and $\\frac{d\\psi}{dy} \\to 0$. This implies that the constant $C_1$ must be zero.

In this frame, the particle is stationary. The fluid at the shear plane ($y=0$), where the potential is the zeta potential $\\zeta$ (i.e., $\\psi(0)=\\zeta$), adheres to the particle due to the no-slip boundary condition. Therefore, its velocity is zero: $v_x(0)=0$. Applying this boundary condition:\n$$ \\eta (0) = \\varepsilon E \\zeta + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\varepsilon E \\zeta $$\nThe velocity profile of the fluid in the particle's reference frame is then:\n$$ v_x(y) = \\frac{\\varepsilon E}{\\eta} (\\psi(y) - \\zeta) $$\nFar from the particle ($y \\to \\infty$), the potential decays to zero ($\\psi(\\infty)=0$), and the fluid moves with a constant velocity relative to the particle.
