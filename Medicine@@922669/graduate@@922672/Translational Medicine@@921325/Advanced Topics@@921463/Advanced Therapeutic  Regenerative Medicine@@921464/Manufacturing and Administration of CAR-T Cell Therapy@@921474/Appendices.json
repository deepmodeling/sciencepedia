The derivation must proceed from the foundational premises provided.\n\nLet $K_1$ be the random variable representing the number of successful integration events in a single cell during the first exposure, and $K_2$ be the random variable for the number of events during the second exposure. According to the problem statement, both exposures are identical, so the number of integrations in each exposure follows a Poisson distribution with the same mean, which is the MOI, $m$.\nThe probability mass function for the number of integrations $k$ in a single exposure is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^k}{k!}$$\nwhere $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nA cell is considered transduced if it experiences at least one integration event across the two independent exposures.

The probabilities are:\n$$P(E_{fail,1}) = P(K_1=0) = \\exp(-m)$$\n$$P(E_{fail,2}) = P(K_2=0) = \\exp(-m)$$\n\nThe problem states that the infection events in the two exposures are independent.

This is the event complementary to a total failure. Thus, the probability of being transduced is $1$ minus the probability of not being transduced at all.\n$$p^{\\ast} = 1 - P(E_{fail,total})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(E_{fail,total})$, we arrive at the derived relationship between $p^{\\ast}$ and $m$:\n$$p^{\\ast} = 1 - \\exp(-2m)$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nThe second part is to compute the MOI, $m$, needed to achieve a target transduction fraction of $p^{\\ast} = 0.90$.
