This quantity is equivalent to the conditional probability that an edit is an HDR-mediated event, given that an edit has occurred.\n\nLet us define the events and probabilities based on the provided information. The cell cycle phases represent a partition of the sample space. Let $G1$, $S$, and $G2M$ denote the events that a randomly selected cell is in the G1, S, or G2/M phase, respectively.

Starting from the following foundational principles and assumptions, determine which interpretation best explains how truncation can improve specificity and when it may reduce on-target activity:\n\n- Target recognition proceeds by protein-mediated protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) binding followed by ribonucleic acid:deoxyribonucleic acid (RNA:DNA) heteroduplex (R-loop) formation; the free energy of R-loop formation can be approximated by an additive model: a matched base pair contributes $-\\epsilon$ (kcal/mol), while each mismatch imposes an energetic penalty $+\\delta$ (kcal/mol), so that for a guide of length $N$ with $m$ mismatches, the binding free energy is $\\Delta G(N,m) \\approx -N\\epsilon + m\\delta$.\n- The dissociation rate increases with weaker binding according to an Arrhenius-like relation $k_{\\text{off}}(N,m) = k_{*}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(\\Delta G(N,m)/RT\\big)$, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is temperature.\n- Productive cleavage requires that the Complex of Cas9 and target DNA remains bound long enough to complete chemistry; in a simple kinetic competition, cleavage and dissociation are competing first-order processes with rates $k_{\\text{chem}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$, respectively.\n- Use the following parameter values representative of physiological conditions: $RT = 0.593$ kcal/mol (at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$), $\\epsilon = 0.5$ kcal/mol, $\\delta = 3.0$ kcal/mol, $k_{*} = 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{chem}} = 1.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nConsider two cases: a conventional $N = 20$ guide and a truncated $N = 17$ guide, each evaluated at an on-target site ($m=0$) and at a near-cognate site with a single mismatch ($m=1$). Using only the principles above (without invoking any empirical shortcut rules), which statement best captures the expected effect of truncation on mismatch tolerance (specificity) and the potential cost to on-target activity?\n\nA. Truncating to $N=17$ increases specificity because both on-target and mismatched complexes dissociate faster, but the single-mismatch complex crosses a kinetic threshold where dissociation outcompetes chemistry much more strongly, causing a disproportionately larger drop in cleavage probability at the mismatched site while leaving on-target probability near unity; at lower $k_{\\text{chem}}$ or under conditions that further destabilize binding, the on-target probability can also decrease, revealing a potential cost to activity.\n\nB. Truncating to $N=17$ decreases specificity because reducing $N$ equally destabilizes on-target and mismatched complexes, leaving their probabilities in a constant ratio, so mismatch discrimination does not improve while on-target activity is uniformly reduced.\n\nC. Truncating to $N=17$ increases specificity primarily by strengthening PAM recognition, thereby rejecting near-cognate sites with suboptimal PAMs; on-target activity remains unchanged because PAM recognition is independent of guide length.\n\nD.

The probability of cleavage, $P_{\\text{cleave}}$, for a bound complex is given by the branching ratio of these two competing pathways:\n$$P_{\\text{cleave}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{chem}}}{k_{\\text{chem}} + k_{\\text{off}}}$$\nThis equation shows that cleavage is highly probable ($P_{\\text{cleave}} \\approx 1$) when dissociation is slow compared to chemistry ($k_{\\text{off}} \\ll k_{\\text{chem}}$). Conversely, cleavage is improbable ($P_{\\text{cleave}} \\ll 1$) when dissociation is much faster than chemistry ($k_{\\text{off}} \\gg k_{\\text{chem}}$). The transition between these regimes occurs when $k_{\\text{off}}$ is of similar magnitude to $k_{\\text{chem}}$. This is the \"kinetic threshold\" that governs specificity.\n\nTo analyze the effect of truncating the guide RNA, we must calculate $P_{\\text{cleave}}$ for the four specified cases using the provided model and parameters.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Guide lengths: $N=20$ (conventional) and $N=17$ (truncated).\n- Mismatches: $m=0$ (on-target) and $m=1$ (near-cognate).\n- Energetic parameters: $\\epsilon = 0.5$ kcal/mol, $\\delta = 3.0$ kcal/mol.\n- Kinetic parameters: $k_{*} = 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{chem}} = 1.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n- Thermal energy: $RT = 0.593$ kcal/mol.\n\nFirst, we calculate the binding free energy, $\\Delta G(N,m) = -N\\epsilon + m\\delta$, for each case.\n1.  **Conventional, On-target ($N=20, m=0$):**\n    $\\Delta G(20,0) = -(20)(0.5) + (0)(3.0) = -10.0$ kcal/mol.\n2.  **Conventional, Mismatched ($N=20, m=1$):**\n    $\\Delta G(20,1) = -(20)(0.5) + (1)(3.0) = -7.0$ kcal/mol.\n3.  **Truncated, On-target ($N=17, m=0$):**\n    $\\Delta G(17,0) = -(17)(0.5) + (0)(3.0) = -8.5$ kcal/mol.\n4.  **Truncated, Mismatched ($N=17, m=1$):**\n    $\\Delta G(17,1) = -(17)(0.5) + (1)(3.0) = -5.5$ kcal/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}(N,m) = k_{*}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(\\Delta G(N,m)/RT\\big)$, for each case.\n1.  **$k_{\\text{off}}(20,0)$:**\n    $k_{\\text{off}}(20,0) = 10^3\\ \\text{s}^{-1} \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{-10.0\\ \\text{kcal/mol}}{0.593\\ \\text{kcal/mol}}\\right) \\approx 10^3 \\times \\exp(-16.86) \\approx 4.75 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n2.  **$k_{\\text{off}}(20,1)$:**\n    $k_{\\text{off}}(20,1) = 10^3\\ \\text{s}^{-1} \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{-7.0\\ \\text{kcal/mol}}{0.593\\ \\text{kcal/mol}}\\right) \\approx 10^3 \\times \\exp(-11.80) \\approx 7.47 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n3.  **$k_{\\text{off}}(17,0)$:**\n    $k_{\\text{off}}(17,0) = 10^3\\ \\text{s}^{-1} \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{-8.5\\ \\text{kcal/mol}}{0.593\\ \\text{kcal/mol}}\\right) \\approx 10^3 \\times \\exp(-14.33) \\approx 5.95 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n4.  **$k_{\\text{off}}(17,1)$:**\n    $k_{\\text{off}}(17,1) = 10^3\\ \\text{s}^{-1} \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{-5.5\\ \\text{kcal/mol}}{0.593\\ \\text{kcal/mol}}\\right) \\approx 10^3 \\times \\exp(-9.28) \\approx 9.37 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the cleavage probability, $P_{\\text{cleave}} = k_{\\text{chem}} / (k_{\\text{chem}} + k_{\\text{off}})$, using $k_{\\text{chem}} = 1.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n1.  **$P_{\\text{cleave}}(20,0)$:**\n    $P_{\\text{cleave}}(20,0) = \\frac{1.0}{1.0 + 4.75 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.99995$. (On-target activity is near unity).\n2.  **$P_{\\text{cleave}}(20,1)$:**\n    $P_{\\text{cleave}}(20,1) = \\frac{1.0}{1.0 + 7.47 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 0.9926$. (High off-target activity).\n3.  **$P_{\\text{cleave}}(17,0)$:**\n    $P_{\\text{cleave}}(17,0) = \\frac{1.0}{1.0 + 5.95 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 0.9994$. (On-target activity remains near unity).\n4.  **$P_{\\text{cleave}}(17,1)$:**\n    $P_{\\text{cleave}}(17,1) = \\frac{1.0}{1.0 + 0.0937} \\approx 0.9143$. (Noticeably lower off-target activity).\n\nNow we interpret these results.\nFor the conventional guide ($N=20$), both on-target and single-mismatch dissociation rates ($4.75 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $7.47 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$) are much smaller than the cleavage rate ($1.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$). As a result, both complexes are so stable that cleavage almost always occurs before dissociation, leading to high cleavage probabilities for both ($0.99995$ and $0.9926$). The specificity, which can be seen as the ratio of on-target to off-target cleavage, is very low: $0.99995 / 0.9926 \\approx 1.007$.\n\nTruncating the guide to $N=17$ destabilizes both on-target and off-target complexes, increasing their dissociation rates.\n- The on-target $k_{\\text{off}}(17,0)$ increases to $5.95 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. This is still much smaller than $k_{\\text{chem}}$, so the cleavage probability $P_{\\text{cleave}}(17,0)$ remains very close to unity ($0.9994$).\n- The off-target $k_{\\text{off}}(17,1)$ increases to $0.0937\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. This value is now on the same order of magnitude as $k_{\\text{chem}}$. Dissociation has become a significant competing process. This causes the cleavage probability $P_{\\text{cleave}}(17,1)$ to drop substantially to $0.9143$.\n\nThis analysis reveals that truncation causes a minimal change in on-target cleavage probability (from $0.99995$ to $0.9994$) but a much larger, disproportionate drop in off-target cleavage probability (from $0.9926$ to $0.9143$). The specificity ratio improves significantly to $0.9994 / 0.9143 \\approx 1.093$. This improvement is because destabilization pushed the mismatched complex's kinetics over the \"kinetic threshold\" where $k_{\\text{off}} \\approx k_{\\text{chem}}$, while the on-target complex remained well below it.\n\nThe second part of the question concerns the potential cost to on-target activity. If the on-target complex were further destabilized (e.g., by more extreme truncation, or lower $k_{\\text{chem}}$), its $k_{\\text{off}}$ could also approach or exceed $k_{\\text{chem}}$, leading to a drop in on-target cleavage probability. For instance, if $k_{\\text{chem}}$ were $0.01\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, the on-target probability for the $N=17$ guide would become $P_{\\text{cleave}}(17,0) = 0.01 / (0.01 + 5.95 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx 0.94$, a clear reduction in on-target activity.\n\nWith this comprehensive analysis, we can evaluate the options.\n\n**A. Truncating to $N=17$ increases specificity because both on-target and mismatched complexes dissociate faster, but the single-mismatch complex crosses a kinetic threshold where dissociation outcompetes chemistry much more strongly, causing a disproportionately larger drop in cleavage probability at the mismatched site while leaving on-target probability near unity; at lower $k_{\\text{chem}}$ or under conditions that further destabilize binding, the on-target probability can also decrease, revealing a potential cost to activity.**\nThis statement perfectly matches our derived results and interpretation. Truncation increases dissociation rates ($k_{\\text{off}}$) for both complexes. The mismatched complex's $k_{\\text{off}}$ becomes comparable to $k_{\\text{chem}}$ (the kinetic threshold), causing a large drop in its cleavage probability. The on-target complex's $k_{\\text{off}}$ remains small relative to $k_{\\text{chem}}$, so its cleavage probability is nearly unaffected. The statement also correctly identifies the conditions under which on-target activity would be compromised.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Truncating to $N=17$ decreases specificity because reducing $N$ equally destabilizes on-target and mismatched complexes, leaving their probabilities in a constant ratio, so mismatch discrimination does not improve while on-target activity is uniformly reduced.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, our calculations show that specificity *increases*, it does not decrease. Second, while the factor by which $k_{\\text{off}}$ increases is the same for both complexes, the cleavage probabilities are a non-linear function of $k_{\\text{off}}$, $P_{\\text{cleave}} = k_{\\text{chem}}/(k_{\\text{chem}}+k_{\\text{off}})$. Therefore, their ratio does not remain constant. The specificity ratio changed from $\\approx 1.007$ to $\\approx 1.093$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Truncating to $N=17$ increases specificity primarily by strengthening PAM recognition, thereby rejecting near-cognate sites with suboptimal PAMs; on-target activity remains unchanged because PAM recognition is independent of guide length.**\nThis statement invokes mechanisms outside the provided model. The problem restricts the analysis to the given principles, which model R-loop energetics and kinetics, not PAM recognition. The model does not support any link between guide length ($N$) and PAM binding strength.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Truncating to $N=17$ increases specificity by shortening the seed region, thereby reducing the probability that a genomic site contains a mismatch within the seed; on-target activity increases because R-loop formation accelerates with shorter guides.**\nThis statement also invokes concepts not present in the provided model, namely the \"seed region\". The additive energy model $\\Delta G(N,m)$ treats all base pair positions equally. Furthermore, it claims that on-target activity *increases*. Our calculations show a slight *decrease* in on-target activity (from $0.99995$ to $0.9994$). Finally, the model does not describe the rate of R-loop formation, so the claim about acceleration is unsupported.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5051030"}, {"introduction": "After designing and deploying a CRISPR-based therapeutic, rigorous assessment of its off-target activity is a non-negotiable step in preclinical safety evaluation.

Let $L_1 = P(D \\mid T=1)$ and $L_0 = P(D \\mid T=0)$.\n$$ P(T=1 \\mid D) = \\frac{L_1 \\pi}{L_1 \\pi + L_0 (1-\\pi)} $$\nSubstituting the Poisson expressions:\n$$ P(T=1 \\mid D) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{G,1}) \\lambda_{G,1}^{c_G}}{c_G!}\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{C,1}) \\lambda_{C,1}^{c_C}}{c_C!}\\right) \\pi}{\\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{G,1}) \\lambda_{G,1}^{c_G}}{c_G!}\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{C,1}) \\lambda_{C,1}^{c_C}}{c_C!}\\right) \\pi + \\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{G,0}) \\lambda_{G,0}^{c_G}}{c_G!}\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{C,0}) \\lambda_{C,0}^{c_C}}{c_C!}\\right) (1-\\pi)} $$\nThe factorial terms $\\frac{1}{c_G! c_C!}$ are common to the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancel out. This simplifies the analytic expression to:\n$$ P(T=1 \\mid c_G, c_C) = \\frac{\\exp(-(\\lambda_{G,1} + \\lambda_{C,1})) \\lambda_{G,1}^{c_G} \\lambda_{C,1}^{c_C} \\pi}{\\exp(-(\\lambda_{G,1} + \\lambda_{C,1})) \\lambda_{G,1}^{c_G} \\lambda_{C,1}^{c_C} \\pi + \\exp(-(\\lambda_{G,0} + \\lambda_{C,0})) \\lambda_{G,0}^{c_G} \\lambda_{C,0}^{c_C} (1-\\pi)} $$\nThis is the derived analytic expression for the posterior probability.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n- $\\lambda_{G,1} = 5$, $\\lambda_{G,0} = 1$\n- $\\lambda_{C,1} = 10$, $\\lambda_{C,0} = 3$\n- $c_G = 4$, $c_C = 8$\n- $\\pi = 0.05$, so $1-\\pi = 0.95$\n\nLet's compute the components of the numerator and denominator.\nLet the numerator term be $N_1$:\n$$ N_1 = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{G,1} + \\lambda_{C,1})) \\lambda_{G,1}^{c_G} \\lambda_{C,1}^{c_C} \\pi $$\n$$ N_1 = \\exp(-(5 + 10)) \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^8 \\cdot 0.05 $$\n$$ N_1 = \\exp(-15) \\cdot 625 \\cdot 100000000 \\cdot 0.05 $$\n$$ N_1 = \\exp(-15) \\cdot 3125000000 = 3.125 \\times 10^9 \\exp(-15) $$\n\nLet the second term in the denominator be $N_0$:\n$$ N_0 = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{G,0} + \\lambda_{C,0})) \\lambda_{G,0}^{c_G} \\lambda_{C,0}^{c_C} (1-\\pi) $$\n$$ N_0 = \\exp(-(1 + 3)) \\cdot 1^4 \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 0.95 $$\n$$ N_0 = \\exp(-4) \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6561 \\cdot 0.95 $$\n$$ N_0 = \\exp(-4) \\cdot 6232.95 $$\n\nThe posterior probability is $P(T=1 \\mid D) = \\frac{N_1}{N_1 + N_0}$.\n$$ P(T=1 \\mid D) = \\frac{3.125 \\times 10^9 \\exp(-15)}{3.125 \\times 10^9 \\exp(-15) + 6232.95 \\exp(-4)} $$\nTo simplify the computation and avoid potential underflow with very small numbers, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(-4)$:\n$$ P(T=1 \\mid D) = \\frac{3.125 \\times 10^9 \\exp(-11)}{3.125 \\times 10^9 \\exp(-11) + 6232.95} $$\nLet's compute the value of the term $3.125 \\times 10^9 \\exp(-11)$.\n$$ 3.125 \\times 10^9 \\cdot \\exp(-11) \\approx 3.125 \\times 10^9 \\cdot (1.670170079 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 52192.815 $$\nNow substitute this value back into the expression for the probability:\n$$ P(T=1 \\mid D) \\approx \\frac{52192.815}{52192.815 + 6232.95} = \\frac{52192.815}{58425.765} \\approx 0.8933203 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we obtain $0.8933$.\nThe final posterior probability that the site is a true off-target, given the observed read counts, is approximately $0.8933$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.8933} $$", "id": "5051023"}]}
