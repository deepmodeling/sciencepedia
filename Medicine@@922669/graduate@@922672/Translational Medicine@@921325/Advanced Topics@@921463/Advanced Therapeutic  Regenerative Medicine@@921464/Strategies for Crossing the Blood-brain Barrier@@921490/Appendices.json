At steady state, the rate of drug influx into the brain compartment equals the rate of drug efflux from it.\n\nLet $C_{u,brain}$ be the unbound drug concentration in the brain interstitial fluid and $C_{u,plasma}$ be the unbound drug concentration in the plasma. The problem states that carrier-mediated influx is negligible, so the sole influx mechanism is passive diffusion. The influx rate is proportional to the plasma concentration, given by $PS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,plasma}$, where $PS_{u}$ is the passive permeability-surface area product clearance for the unbound drug.\n\nEfflux from the brain has two components: passive diffusion back into the plasma, with a rate of $PS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,brain}$, and active P-gp-mediated efflux, with a rate of $CL_{active} \\cdot C_{u,brain}$. Here, $CL_{active}$ is the clearance associated with the active P-gp transport system. The model assumes a linear relationship, which is valid for concentrations well below the transporter's Michaelis-Menten constant $K_m$.\n\nThe steady-state mass balance equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Influx} = \\text{Rate of Efflux}\n$$\n$$\nPS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,plasma} = PS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,brain} + CL_{active} \\cdot C_{u,brain}\n$$\n\nWe can factor out $C_{u,brain}$ on the right side:\n$$\nPS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,plasma} = (PS_{u} + CL_{active}) \\cdot C_{u,brain}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient, $K_{p,uu,brain}$, as the ratio of the unbound concentrations at steady state:\n$$\nK_{p,uu,brain} = \\frac{C_{u,brain}}{C_{u,plasma}}\n$$\n\nRearranging the mass balance equation to solve for this ratio gives:\n$$\nK_{p,uu,brain} = \\frac{PS_{u}}{PS_{u} + CL_{active}}\n$$\n\nThis equation can be rewritten in a more convenient form by dividing the numerator and denominator by $PS_{u}$:\n$$\nK_{p,uu,brain} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{CL_{active}}{PS_{u}}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that in the absence of active transport ($CL_{active}=0$), $K_{p,uu,brain}$ would be $1$. The presence of an active efflux transporter ($CL_{active}0$) reduces the unbound brain concentration, resulting in $K_{p,uu,brain}  1$.\n\nNow, we apply this model to the two conditions given in the problem.\n\n1.  **Baseline Condition**:\n    Let $CL_{active,baseline}$ be the P-gp efflux clearance under baseline conditions.

The new active clearance is $CL_{active,inhibited} = s \\cdot CL_{active,baseline}$. The given partition coefficient is $K_{p,uu,brain,inhibited} = 0.50$. The passive permeability $PS_{u}$ is stated to be unchanged.\n    The new efflux ratio is $J_{inhibited} = \\frac{CL_{active,inhibited}}{PS_{u}} = \\frac{s \\cdot CL_{active,baseline}}{PS_{u}} = s \\cdot J_{baseline}$.\n    $$\n    0.50 = \\frac{1}{1 + J_{inhibited}} = \\frac{1}{1 + s \\cdot J_{baseline}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    1 + s \\cdot J_{baseline} = \\frac{1}{0.50} = 2\n    $$\n    $$\n    s \\cdot J_{baseline} = 1\n    $$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks whether the compound still behaves as an efflux substrate when P-gp is inhibited. For a compound to be an efflux substrate, its active efflux clearance must be greater than zero. Under inhibition, we have $K_{p,uu,brain,inhibited} = 0.50$. Since this value is less than $1$, it signifies that a net efflux process is still operative ($CL_{active,inhibited}  0$). If the efflux were completely blocked ($CL_{active,inhibited} = 0$), the ratio would be $1$. Therefore, the compound does behave as an efflux substrate, albeit a weaker one, under the inhibited condition.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires deriving the fractional reduction in P-gp-mediated efflux clearance, $r = 1 - s$. We have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $J_{baseline}$ and $s$:\n1) $J_{baseline} = 9$\n2) $s \\cdot J_{baseline} = 1$\n\nSubstituting the value of $J_{baseline}$ from the first equation into the second gives:\n$$\ns \\cdot 9 = 1\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n\nThe fractional reduction $r$ is defined as $r = 1 - s$.\n$$\nr = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}\n$$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\nr = \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.888888...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nr = 0.8889\n$$\nThis result indicates an $88.89\\%$ reduction in the P-gp efflux clearance due to the inhibitor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8889}$$", "id": "5064010"}, {"introduction": "Having identified poor passive permeability and active efflux as major barriers, we now turn to a common medicinal chemistry solution: the prodrug strategy.
