Consider an autologous apheresis input of mononuclear cells (MNC). Only the T cell fraction is relevant for CAR transduction, and downstream steps apply multiplicatively to the relevant subpopulation. The fundamental base for this calculation is that the number of cells after a step equals the number entering the step multiplied by the fraction that both enters the step as the correct subpopulation and successfully advances through the step, and that an expansion step increases the cell number by a fold factor.\n\nAn autologous apheresis contains $N_{0} = 2 \\times 10^{9}$ MNC with a T cell fraction $f_{T} = 0.30$.

It is **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived by tracking the number of the relevant cell subpopulation through each sequential step of the process.\n\n1.  **Initial T Cell Count:**\n    The process begins with an apheresis product containing $N_{0}$ MNCs. The initial number of T cells, $N_{T}$, is the product of the total MNC count and the T cell fraction, $f_{T}$.\n    $$N_{T} = N_{0} \\times f_{T}$$\n    Substituting the given numerical values:\n    $$N_{T} = (2 \\times 10^{9}) \\times 0.30 = 6 \\times 10^{8}$$\n\n2.  **Post-Selection T Cell Count:**\n    The T cells are isolated from the MNC population. The T cell selection step has a recovery yield of $r_{s}$. The number of T cells after this step, $N_{T,s}$, is the product of the incoming T cell number, $N_{T}$, and the recovery factor $r_{s}$.\n    $$N_{T,s} = N_{T} \\times r_{s}$$\n    Using the result from the previous step:\n    $$N_{T,s} = (6 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 0.80 = 4.8 \\times 10^{8}$$\n\n3.  **Post-Transduction CAR-Positive T Cell Count:**\n    The selected T cells are genetically modified via viral transduction to express the Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR). The transduction efficiency, $e_{t}$, represents the fraction of T cells that successfully become CAR-positive. The number of CAR-positive T cells, $N_{CAR}$, is the product of the number of cells entering this step, $N_{T,s}$, and the efficiency $e_{t}$.\n    $$N_{CAR} = N_{T,s} \\times e_{t}$$\n    Using the result from the previous step:\n    $$N_{CAR} = (4.8 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 0.50 = 2.4 \\times 10^{8}$$\n\n4.  **Post-Expansion CAR-Positive T Cell Count:**\n    This is the first quantity to be computed: the final CAR-positive cell dose before viability adjustment. The CAR-positive cells are expanded by a fold factor $F$. The total number of CAR-positive cells after expansion, $N_{CAR,exp}$, is the product of the pre-expansion count, $N_{CAR}$, and the expansion factor $F$.\n    $$N_{CAR,exp} = N_{CAR} \\times F$$\n    Using the result from the previous step:\n    $$N_{CAR,exp} = (2.4 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 100 = 2.4 \\times 10^{10}$$\n\n5.  **Viability-Adjusted CAR-Positive Cell Count:**\n    This is the second quantity to be computed. The final release-ready dose consists only of viable cells. The number of viable cells, $N_{final}$, is the product of the total expanded cell count, $N_{CAR,exp}$, and the viability fraction $v$.\n    $$N_{final} = N_{CAR,exp} \\times v$$\n    Using the result from the previous step:\n    $$N_{final} = (2.4 \\times 10^{10}) \\times 0.85 = 2.04 \\times 10^{10}$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the results to be expressed in units of $10^{6}$ cells and rounded to four significant figures.\n\n-   Final CAR-positive cell dose before viability adjustment:\n    The value is $N_{CAR,exp} = 2.4 \\times 10^{10}$ cells. To convert to units of $10^{6}$ cells, we divide by $10^{6}$:\n    $$\\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{10}}{10^{6}} = 2.4 \\times 10^{4} = 24000$$\n    Per the rounding instruction to four significant figures, the value is $24000$.\n\n-   Viability-adjusted CAR-positive cell count at release:\n    The value is $N_{final} = 2.04 \\times 10^{10}$ cells. To convert to units of $10^{6}$ cells, we divide by $10^{6}$:\n    $$\\frac{2.04 \\times 10^{10}}{10^{6}} = 2.04 \\times 10^{4} = 20400$$\n    The calculated result $20400$ has three significant figures. The explicit instruction is to round to four significant figures, which means the fourth significant digit is $0$. Thus, the value is $20400$.\n\nThe two requested numerical values are $24000$ and $20400$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 24000  20400 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4992244"}, {"introduction": "While allogeneic therapies offer \"off-the-shelf\" potential, they introduce the critical risk of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD).

The probability mass function for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$\nP(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of events (a non-negative integer) and $\\lambda$ is the average number of events in the given interval.\n\nAccording to the problem, the encounters are governed by the law of mass action, and the expected number of pathogenic activations, $\\lambda$, is given by the product of the alloreactive T cell content $T_a$, the tissue antigen load $A_t$, and a proportionality constant $\\beta$.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\beta T_a A_t\n$$\nThe problem asks for the probability of at least one pathogenic activation, which is $P(N \\ge 1)$. It is more convenient to calculate this using the complementary event, the probability of zero activations, $P(N=0)$.\n$$\nP(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N=0)\n$$\nUsing the Poisson probability mass function for $k=0$:\n$$\nP(N=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1} = \\exp(-\\lambda)\n$$\nTherefore, the expression for the probability of at least one pathogenic activation (which we will denote as $P_{\\text{GVHD}}$) is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{GVHD}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - \\exp(-\\beta T_a A_t)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we must compute the expected GVHD incidence after the specified TCR-$\\alpha$ knockout.
