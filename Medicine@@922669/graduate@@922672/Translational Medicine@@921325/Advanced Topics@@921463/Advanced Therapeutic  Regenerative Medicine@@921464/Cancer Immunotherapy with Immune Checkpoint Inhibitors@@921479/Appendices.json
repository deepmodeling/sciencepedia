By definition, TMB is the number of somatic, coding, nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) per megabase of interrogated genome at adequate depth. On targeted panels, the panel-normalized TMB is estimated by dividing the number of qualifying mutations by the effective number of megabases covered at or above a pre-specified depth threshold, after excluding regions with poor mappability or low complexity. In panel contexts, to reduce selection bias from recurrently mutated drivers, known oncogenic hotspot variants may be excluded from the count.\n\nConsider the following scientifically realistic scenario for a patient tumor profiled with a targeted panel:\n\n- The panel’s bait footprint spans $1.50$ megabases of coding exons by design.\n- After coverage quality control, a fraction $0.12$ of baited bases fail the minimum depth threshold and are excluded from the callable territory.\n- An additional $0.020$ megabases of low-complexity or poorly mappable regions are blacklisted from analysis.\n- Variant calling within the callable, on-target region yields $84$ candidate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and $6$ candidate small insertions/deletions (indels).\n- Matched-normal analysis classifies $16$ of the SNVs and $2$ of the indels as germline, which are excluded from the somatic set.\n- Cross-referencing the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) flags $8$ additional SNVs and $1$ additional indel as likely germline/common; these are excluded.\n- Technical artifact filters remove $4$ more SNVs for biases.\n- Of the remaining SNVs, functional annotation indicates $9$ are synonymous; these are excluded from TMB.\n- Of the remaining nonsynonymous SNVs, $2$ match cataloged oncogenic hotspots; these are excluded for panel-based TMB to minimize selection bias.\n- All remaining indels are coding frameshift events and are included in TMB.\n\nStarting only from the core definition that TMB equals the count of somatic, coding, nonsynonymous SNVs and coding indels per megabase of effectively interrogated territory, construct the panel-based TMB estimator and compute the panel-normalized TMB for this sample.

It describes a realistic workflow for estimating tumor mutational burden (TMB) from targeted panel sequencing data. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe central task is to compute the panel-normalized TMB, which is defined as the total number of qualifying somatic mutations divided by the size of the effectively interrogated genomic territory in megabases (MB). The calculation can be separated into two main parts: determining the denominator (the effective territory size) and determining the numerator (the count of qualifying mutations).\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective size of the interrogated genomic territory, which we will denote as $S_{eff}$. The starting point is the designed bait footprint of the panel.\nLet $S_{design}$ be the designed panel size.\n$$S_{design} = 1.50 \\text{ MB}$$\nA fraction of this territory, $f_{depth} = 0.12$, is excluded due to insufficient sequencing depth. The size of this excluded region is:\n$$S_{excluded, depth} = f_{depth} \\times S_{design} = 0.12 \\times 1.50 \\text{ MB} = 0.18 \\text{ MB}$$\nAdditionally, a specified amount of territory is blacklisted due to low complexity or poor mappability. Let this size be $S_{blacklist}$.\n$$S_{blacklist} = 0.020 \\text{ MB}$$\nThe total effective territory is the designed size minus all excluded regions. Assuming the region failing depth and the blacklisted region are distinct or their sizes are additive for exclusion purposes, which is a standard approach.\n$$S_{eff} = S_{design} - S_{excluded, depth} - S_{blacklist}$$\n$$S_{eff} = 1.50 \\text{ MB} - 0.18 \\text{ MB} - 0.020 \\text{ MB} = 1.30 \\text{ MB}$$\nThis value serves as the denominator for the TMB calculation.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of qualifying mutations, which we will denote as $N_{mut}$. This requires a sequential filtering of the initial candidate variants based on the criteria provided and the definition of TMB. The definition specifies somatic, coding, nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and coding small insertions/deletions (indels).\n\nWe begin with the initial number of candidate variants called:\n- Candidate SNVs: $N_{SNV, cand} = 84$\n- Candidate indels: $N_{indel, cand} = 6$\n\nWe apply the filters in sequence.\n\n1.  **Exclusion of germline variants (matched-normal analysis):**\n    - SNVs remaining: $84 - 16 = 68$\n    - Indels remaining: $6 - 2 = 4$\n\n2.  **Exclusion of likely germline/common variants (database cross-referencing):**\n    - SNVs remaining: $68 - 8 = 60$\n    - Indels remaining: $4 - 1 = 3$\n\n3.  **Exclusion of technical artifacts:**\n    - SNVs remaining: $60 - 4 = 56$\n    - Indels remaining: $3$ (no indels removed for artifacts)\n\nAt this stage, we have a set of $56$ high-confidence somatic SNVs and $3$ high-confidence somatic indels.\n\n4.  **Exclusion based on functional annotation:** The TMB definition includes only *nonsynonymous* SNVs.\n    - The problem states $9$ of the remaining SNVs are synonymous. These are excluded.\n    - Nonsynonymous SNVs: $56 - 9 = 47$\n    - The problem states that all remaining indels are coding frameshift events, which are included in TMB.

The number of responses, $X$, is modeled as a binomial random variable, $X \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p)$.\n\nThe method specified is the \"exact binomial method,\" commonly known as the Clopper-Pearson method. This method constructs a confidence interval by inverting two separate one-sided hypothesis tests. A two-sided $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for $p$, denoted $[p_L, p_U]$, is defined by the following relations:\n1.  The lower bound, $p_L$, is the value of $p$ for which the probability of observing a result of $x$ or more is $\\alpha/2$. This is expressed as $P(X \\ge x | p=p_L) = \\sum_{k=x}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p_L^k (1-p_L)^{n-k} = \\alpha/2$.\n2.

Using the definition above with $x=0$:\n$$P(X \\le 0 | p=p_U) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nThe event $X \\le 0$ for a binomial random variable is identical to the event $X=0$. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n$$P(X = 0 | p=p_U) = 0.025$$\nThe probability mass function for the binomial distribution gives $P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$.
