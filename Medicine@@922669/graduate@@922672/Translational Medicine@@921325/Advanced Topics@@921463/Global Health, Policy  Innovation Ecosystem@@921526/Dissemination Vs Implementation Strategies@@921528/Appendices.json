It provides all necessary data ($N$ and the count for $|E|$). It also provides extraneous data (the number of clinicians who read the bulletin fully), but this does not create a contradiction. Instead, it serves to test the solver's ability to adhere strictly to the given operational definition of \"reach,\" which is based on \"exposure\" (opens), not on \"reading fully.\" The problem explicitly directs the user to use only the provided definition, reinforcing this point.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The numbers are plausible in the context of a large-scale health communication campaign.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The definitions are unambiguous. \"Unique open events\" directly maps to the size of the set of exposed clinicians, $|E|$.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is straightforward but requires careful reading to correctly identify the relevant data, a valid test of comprehension.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The calculation is directly verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of dissemination reach, denoted by $r$. The problem statement provides a precise operational definition and a corresponding formula.\n\nThe formula for dissemination reach is given as:\n$$r = \\frac{|E|}{N}$$\nwhere:\n- $N$ is the total size of the intended audience.\n- $E$ is the set of clinicians exposed to the message.\n- $|E|$ is the number of unique clinicians in the set $E$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the intended audience size is $N = 10{,}000$.\n\nThe definition of \"exposure\" is operationalized as \"opening the bulletin at least once, as recorded by unique open events\". The problem states that there were $3{,}200$ unique opens of the bulletin. Since these are de-duplicated at the clinician level, this number directly corresponds to the number of unique clinicians who were exposed to the message. Therefore, the size of the set of exposed clinicians is $|E| = 3{,}200$.\n\nThe information that $2{,}400$ clinicians \"read the bulletin fully\" is explicitly noted as a subset of exposure. The problem's constraint is to use \"only the definition of dissemination reach as stated above,\" which is based on exposure (opens), not full reading. Thus, the figure of $2{,}400$ is extraneous to the calculation of reach and must be disregarded.\n\nSubstituting the correct values into the formula for reach:\n$$r = \\frac{3{,}200}{10{,}000}$$\nCalculating the value of this fraction gives:\n$$r = 0.32$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal and rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.32$ has two significant figures (the '3' and the '2').

In Implementation Science (IS), fidelity is operationalized as adherence to theory-defined core components.

The observed steps are independent and identically distributed realizations of a Bernoulli process with an unknown probability $p$ of correct execution when the implementation strategy is functioning as designed.

There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of scientific principles. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Construction\n\n**2.1. Define the Raw Adherence Rate ($R$)**\nThe problem states that the raw adherence rate is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the parameter $p$ of a Bernoulli process. For $a$ successes in $A$ trials, the likelihood function is $L(p) = \\binom{A}{a} p^a (1-p)^{A-a}$. The log-likelihood is $\\ln L(p) = \\ln\\binom{A}{a} + a\\ln(p) + (A-a)\\ln(1-p)$. To find the MLE, we differentiate with respect to $p$ and set the result to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dp}\\ln L(p) = \\frac{a}{p} - \\frac{A-a}{1-p} = 0 $$\nSolving for $p$ gives the MLE, which we denote as $R$:\n$$ a(1-p) = (A-a)p \\implies a - ap = Ap - ap \\implies a = Ap \\implies p = \\frac{a}{A} $$\nThus, the raw adherence rate is $R = \\frac{a}{A}$.\n\n**2.2. Construct the Adjusted Fidelity Score Function ($F(R)$)**\nWe must construct a function $F(R)$ that maps the raw adherence rate $R \\in [0, 1]$ to an adjusted score in $[0, 1]$, following the given principles.\n\n- **Principles 1 and 2**: $F(1) = 1$ and $F(0) = 0$. These define the boundary conditions of our function.\n\n- **Principle 3 (Tolerance Band)**: Deviations up to a proportion $\\tau$ of missed steps are tolerated. The proportion of missed steps is $1-R$. The condition for being within the tolerance band is $1 - R \\le \\tau$, which is equivalent to $R \\ge 1 - \\tau$. The principle states that $F(R)$ is constant for all $R$ in the interval $[1-\\tau, 1]$. Since this interval includes $R=1$, and we know from Principle 1 that $F(1)=1$, the constant value must be $1$.\nTherefore, for $R \\in [1-\\tau, 1]$, we have $F(R) = 1$.\n\n- **Principle 4 & 5 (Linearity, Continuity, Scaling)**: $F(R)$ increases continuously and linearly *outside* the tolerance band. The region outside the tolerance band is the interval $[0, 1-\\tau)$. On this interval, $F(R)$ must be a linear function, i.e., $F(R) = mR + c$ for some slope $m$ and intercept $c$.\n    - From Principle 2, the function must pass through the origin $(0, 0)$. So, $F(0) = m(0) + c = 0$, which implies $c=0$. The function on this interval is $F(R) = mR$.\n    - The function must be continuous at the point where the two pieces meet, which is $R = 1-\\tau$. This means the value of the linear part must equal the value of the constant part at this point.\n    $$ \\lim_{R \\to (1-\\tau)^-} F(R) = F(1-\\tau) $$\n    $$ m(1-\\tau) = 1 $$\n    - Solving for the slope $m$, we get $m = \\frac{1}{1-\\tau}$.\n\nCombining these findings, the adjusted fidelity score function $F(R)$ is a piecewise function defined as:\n$$ F(R) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{R}{1-\\tau} & \\text{if } 0 \\le R < 1-\\tau \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } 1-\\tau \\le R \\le 1 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function satisfies all the given principles.\n\n**2.3. Calculate the Specific Score**\nNow, we apply this function to the data provided in the problem.\n- Given data: $a=72$, $A=90$, and $\\tau=0.10$.\n\n- First, compute the raw adherence rate $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{a}{A} = \\frac{72}{90} = \\frac{8 \\times 9}{10 \\times 9} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8 $$\n\n- Next, determine the threshold for the tolerance band:\n$$ 1 - \\tau = 1 - 0.10 = 0.9 $$\n\n- Compare the raw adherence rate $R$ to the threshold $1-\\tau$:\n$$ R = 0.8 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1-\\tau = 0.9 $$\nSince $0.8 < 0.9$, the raw adherence rate $R$ falls into the lower, linear region of the function, i.e., $R < 1-\\tau$.\n\n- Finally, calculate the adjusted fidelity score $F(R)$ using the linear part of the function:\n$$ F(R) = \\frac{R}{1-\\tau} $$\n$$ F(0.8) = \\frac{0.8}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{0.8}{0.9} = \\frac{8}{9} $$\n\n- The problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.888888... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.8889$.\n\nThe adjusted fidelity score for the clinic is $0.8889$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8889}$$", "id": "5010811"}]}
