The evaluation must be grounded in the following fundamental base: the time value of money (the present value of a deterministic cash flow at time $t$ discounted at rate $r$ is $CF_t/(1+r)^t$) and the law of total expectation for probabilistic cash flows (the expected present value of a cash flow realized only upon survival to time $t$ with survival probability $s_t$ is $s_t \\times CF_t/(1+r)^t$). Risk-adjusted Net Present Value (rNPV) is defined as the sum over all expected discounted inflows minus the sum over all expected discounted outflows, where each future cash flow—positive or negative—is weighted by the probability that the program survives to the point at which that cash flow occurs.\n\nAssume conditional Probability of Success (PoS) per development transition of $p_{\\text{I}}=0.60$ from Phase I to Phase II, $p_{\\text{II}}=0.35$ from Phase II to Phase III, and $p_{\\text{III}}=0.60$ from Phase III to regulatory approval.

I will first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Definition of rNPV**: The sum over all expected discounted inflows minus the sum over all expected discounted outflows.\n- **Expected Present Value (PV) Formula**: For a cash flow $CF_t$ at time $t$ with survival probability $s_t$ and discrete annual discount rate $r$, the expected PV is $\\frac{s_t \\times CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$.\n- **Conditional Probabilities of Success (PoS)**:\n  - Phase I to Phase II: $p_{\\text{I}} = 0.60$\n  - Phase II to Phase III: $p_{\\text{II}} = 0.35$\n  - Phase III to Approval: $p_{\\text{III}} = 0.60$\n- **Discount Rate**: Annual discrete rate $r=0.10$.\n- **Cash Flows (Outflows)** in millions of USD (MUSD):\n  - Phase I Cost: $C_{\\text{Phase I}} = 10$ at year $t=0$.\n  - Phase II Cost: $C_{\\text{Phase II}} = 25$ at year $t=2$.\n  - Phase III Cost: $C_{\\text{Phase III}} = 80$ at year $t=5$.\n- **Cash Flows (Inflows)** in MUSD:\n  - Approval/Launch Inflow: $200$ at year $t=9$.\n  - Perpetual Royalty Stream: $30$ per year, commencing at year $t=10$.\n- **Assumptions**:\n  - Evaluation is at pre-Phase I (time $t=0$).\n  - Phase I cost is certain upon proceeding.\n  - Phase transitions are independent.\n  - Survival probability $s_t$ is the product of preceding conditional PoS.\n  - The royalty stream is a level perpetuity valued at rate $r$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is validated as follows:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses standard and well-established principles of financial valuation, specifically discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis adapted for probabilistic outcomes (rNPV). This is a common methodology in the biopharmaceutical and venture capital industries. The provided probabilities and cost/revenue figures, while simplified, are representative of magnitudes encountered in drug development. The model is scientifically and financially sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (cash flows, timings, probabilities, discount rate) and a clear, unambiguous objective (compute rNPV). There are no missing or contradictory pieces of information. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free from subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe risk-adjusted Net Present Value (rNPV) is the sum of the expected present values of all future cash inflows minus the sum of the expected present values of all future cash outflows.\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} = \\sum_{t} \\frac{s_t \\times (\\text{Expected Inflow at } t)}{(1+r)^t} - \\sum_{t} \\frac{s_t \\times (\\text{Expected Outflow at } t)}{(1+r)^t}\n$$\nWe compute this value from the perspective of time $t=0$. The annual discrete discount rate is $r=0.10$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the survival probabilities ($s_t$) for each cash flow event. The survival probability to a given time is the cumulative probability of successfully passing all preceding development phases.\n- The investment decision is made at $t=0$, so the Phase I cost is certain. The probability of this cash flow occurring is $s_0=1$.\n- The Phase II cost at $t=2$ is conditional on the success of Phase I. The survival probability to the start of Phase II is $s_2 = p_{\\text{I}} = 0.60$.\n- The Phase III cost at $t=5$ is conditional on the success of both Phase I and Phase II. Given independence, the survival probability is $s_5 = p_{\\text{I}} \\times p_{\\text{II}} = 0.60 \\times 0.35 = 0.21$.\n- The inflows at and after $t=9$ are conditional on success through all three phases (Phase I, II, and III). The survival probability to approval is $s_9 = p_{\\text{I}} \\times p_{\\text{II}} \\times p_{\\text{III}} = 0.60 \\times 0.35 \\times 0.60 = 0.126$.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected present value (EPV) of the cash outflows (costs). All costs are given in millions of USD.\nThe EPV of costs, denoted $EPV_{\\text{costs}}$, is:\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{costs}} = \\frac{s_0 \\times C_{\\text{Phase I}}}{(1+r)^0} + \\frac{s_2 \\times C_{\\text{Phase II}}}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{s_5 \\times C_{\\text{Phase III}}}{(1+r)^5}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{costs}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10}{(1+0.10)^0} + \\frac{0.60 \\times 25}{(1+0.10)^2} + \\frac{0.21 \\times 80}{(1+0.10)^5}\n$$\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{costs}} = 10 + \\frac{15}{(1.1)^2} + \\frac{16.8}{(1.1)^5}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected present value (EPV) of the cash inflows (revenues). All revenues are in millions of USD.\nThe inflows consist of a one-time payment of $200$ at $t=9$ and a perpetual royalty stream of $30$ per year starting at $t=10$. Both are contingent on approval, which occurs at $t=9$ with probability $s_9=0.126$.\nFirst, we find the value of the perpetual royalty stream. The formula for the present value of a level perpetuity is $PV = \\frac{A}{r}$, where $A$ is the annual payment. This formula gives the value one period before the first payment. Since the first payment is at $t=10$, this formula gives the value at $t=9$.\nValue of the perpetuity at $t=9$, denoted $V_9$:\n$$\nV_9 = \\frac{30}{r} = \\frac{30}{0.10} = 300\n$$\nThe total cash value realized at $t=9$, conditional on approval, is the sum of the one-time payment and the value of the perpetuity: $200 + 300 = 500$.\nThe EPV of inflows, denoted $EPV_{\\text{inflows}}$, is the present value at $t=0$ of this total amount, weighted by the probability of approval:\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{inflows}} = \\frac{s_9 \\times (200 + V_9)}{(1+r)^9} = \\frac{0.126 \\times (200+300)}{(1+0.10)^9}\n$$\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{inflows}} = \\frac{0.126 \\times 500}{(1.1)^9} = \\frac{63}{(1.1)^9}\n$$\n\nFinally, the rNPV is the difference between the EPV of inflows and the EPV of outflows:\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} = EPV_{\\text{inflows}} - EPV_{\\text{costs}} = \\frac{63}{(1.1)^9} - \\left( 10 + \\frac{15}{(1.1)^2} + \\frac{16.8}{(1.1)^5} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$$\n\\frac{63}{(1.1)^9} \\approx \\frac{63}{2.35794769} \\approx 26.71803\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{15}{(1.1)^2} = \\frac{15}{1.21} \\approx 12.39669\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{16.8}{(1.1)^5} = \\frac{16.8}{1.61051} \\approx 10.43149\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the rNPV equation:\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} \\approx 26.71803 - (10 + 12.39669 + 10.43149)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} \\approx 26.71803 - 32.82818\n$$\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} \\approx -6.11015\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The value $-6.11015$ rounded to four significant figures is $-6.110$.

It presents a standard quantitative finance problem related to venture capital financing and capitalization table modeling. The definitions are precise, and the objective is clear. The problem is scientifically grounded within the principles of corporate finance. Therefore, a complete solution can be derived.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- $V_{\\text{pre}}$: The pre-money valuation, given as $\\$18 \\times 10^6$.\n- $I$: The new cash investment from the priced round, given as $\\$10 \\times 10^6$.\n- $N_P$: The principal amount of the outstanding convertible note, given as $\\$2 \\times 10^6$.\n- $N_{cap}$: The valuation cap on the convertible note, given as $\\$12 \\times 10^6$.\n- $N_d$: The discount on the convertible note, given as $20\\%$ or $0.20$.\n- $o_{EOP}$: The target percentage for the employee option pool (EOP), given as $15\\%$ or $0.15$.\n- $S_F$: The number of shares held by founders.\n- $S_{EOP}$: The number of shares in the expanded employee option pool.\n- $S_{pre}$: The total pre-money, fully diluted number of shares.

The problem states that the pre-money, fully diluted capitalization, $S_{pre}$, includes all founders' shares and the full employee option pool at its target size of $15\\%$.\n$$S_{pre} = S_F + S_{EOP}$$\nThe problem also specifies that the EOP must constitute $15\\%$ of this pre-money capitalization.\n$$S_{EOP} = o_{EOP} \\times S_{pre} = 0.15 S_{pre}$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives:\n$$S_{pre} = S_F + 0.15 S_{pre}$$\nSolving for $S_F$ in terms of $S_{pre}$:\n$$(1 - 0.15) S_{pre} = S_F$$\n$$S_F = 0.85 S_{pre}$$\nThis equation signifies that after the option pool is expanded to its target size, the founders hold $85\\%$ of the pre-money, fully diluted shares. The absolute number of shares, $S_{pre}$, is not given, but we can express all share quantities in terms of it.\n\nNext, we determine the price per share for the new round, $P_0$. It is defined as the pre-money valuation divided by the pre-money shares.\n$$P_0 = \\frac{V_{\\text{pre}}}{S_{pre}} = \\frac{18 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}$$\n\nThe convertible note converts at a price per share, $P_N$, which is the minimum of a discount price, $P_{discount}$, and a cap price, $P_{cap}$.\nThe discount price is calculated from the round price $P_0$.\n$$P_{discount} = (1 - N_d) P_0 = (1 - 0.20) P_0 = 0.80 P_0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_0$:\n$$P_{discount} = 0.80 \\left(\\frac{18 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}\\right) = \\frac{14.4 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}$$\nThe cap price is defined by the valuation cap and the pre-money shares.\n$$P_{cap} = \\frac{N_{cap}}{S_{pre}} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}$$\nTo determine the conversion price $P_N$, we compare $P_{discount}$ and $P_{cap}$. Since $12 \\times 10^6 < 14.4 \\times 10^6$, it is clear that $P_{cap} < P_{discount}$. Therefore, the note converts at the cap price.\n$$P_N = \\min(P_{discount}, P_{cap}) = P_{cap} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the number of shares issued to the new investors, $S_I$, and to the note holders, $S_N$.\nThe new investors invest an amount $I$ at the price $P_0$.\n$$S_I = \\frac{I}{P_0} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^6}{\\frac{18 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}} = \\frac{10}{18} S_{pre} = \\frac{5}{9} S_{pre}$$\nThe note holders convert their principal $N_P$ at the price $P_N$.\n$$S_N = \\frac{N_P}{P_N} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^6}{\\frac{12 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}} = \\frac{2}{12} S_{pre} = \\frac{1}{6} S_{pre}$$\n\nThe total number of post-closing, fully diluted shares, $S_{post}$, is the sum of the pre-money shares, the shares issued to note holders, and the shares issued to new investors.\n$$S_{post} = S_{pre} + S_N + S_I$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_N$ and $S_I$ in terms of $S_{pre}$:\n$$S_{post} = S_{pre} + \\frac{1}{6} S_{pre} + \\frac{5}{9} S_{pre}$$\nFactoring out $S_{pre}$:\n$$S_{post} = S_{pre} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{5}{9}\\right)$$\nTo sum the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $18$.\n$$S_{post} = S_{pre} \\left(\\frac{18}{18} + \\frac{3}{18} + \\frac{10}{18}\\right) = S_{pre} \\left(\\frac{18 + 3 + 10}{18}\\right) = S_{pre} \\left(\\frac{31}{18}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the founders' post-closing, fully diluted ownership fraction.

Second, we analyze the distribution of proceeds (the \"waterfall\") at a series of specified exit valuations. For clarity, all monetary values will be expressed in millions of United States dollars (USD).\n\nLet $V_{pre}$ be the pre-money valuation, $I$ be the new capital injection, and $V_{post}$ be the post-money valuation.\nThe given values are:\n$V_{pre} = \\$45$ million\n$I = \\$15$ million\n\nThe post-money valuation is defined as the sum of the pre-money valuation and the new investment:\n$$V_{post} = V_{pre} + I = \\$45 + \\$15 = \\$60 \\text{ million}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the ownership percentages ($O$) for each class of shareholder: the Series A investor, the Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP), and the founders.\n\nThe Series A investor's ownership is their investment divided by the post-money valuation:\n$$O_{inv} = \\frac{I}{V_{post}} = \\frac{\\$15}{\\$60} = 0.25 = 25\\%$$\n\nThe problem states that the ESOP is to represent $20\\%$ of the post-money capitalization.

Let this be $L_{pref}$.\n    $$L_{pref} = 1 \\times I = 1 \\times \\$15 = \\$15 \\text{ million}$$\n2.  Convert their preferred shares to common stock and receive a pro rata share of the exit proceeds. The value of this option is $O_{inv} \\times V_{exit}$, where $V_{exit}$ is the total exit valuation.\n\nThe investor will choose the option that maximizes their return. The payout to the investor, $P_{inv}$, is therefore:\n$$P_{inv} = \\max(L_{pref}, O_{inv} \\times V_{exit})$$\n\nThe crossover point, where the two options are of equal value, occurs at an exit valuation $V_{exit}^{*}$ where $O_{inv} \\times V_{exit}^{*} = L_{pref}$.\n$$0.25 \\times V_{exit}^{*} = \\$15 \\text{ million} \\implies V_{exit}^{*} = \\frac{\\$15}{0.25} = \\$60 \\text{ million}$$\n\nIf the investor takes the liquidation preference, the remaining proceeds, $R$, are distributed to the common shareholders (founders and ESOP).

This is greater than the $\\$15$ million preference.\nIn this case, all proceeds are distributed pro rata according to post-money ownership stakes.\nInvestor Payout:\n$$P_{inv,3} = O_{inv} \\times V_{exit,3} = 0.25 \\times \\$300 = \\$75 \\text{ million}$$\nFounder Payout:\n$$P_{found,3} = O_{found} \\times V_{exit,3} = 0.55 \\times \\$300 = \\$165 \\text{ million}$$\n\nSummarizing the payout amounts in millions of USD:\n- At $\\$30$M exit: Founder = $11$, Investor = $15$.\n- At $\\$60$M exit: Founder = $33$, Investor = $15$.\n- At $\\$300$M exit: Founder = $165$, Investor = $75$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a single row matrix in the requested order.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 11 & 15 & 33 & 15 & 165 & 75 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "5059336"}]}
