The context of a biomarker-based enrichment strategy for a translational clinical trial is a standard and highly relevant application within the specified field. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data and definitions are provided to compute a unique and meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The provided numerical values are plausible for a real-world diagnostic test. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A formal solution will be derived.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease and $D^c$ be the event that a patient does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event that a patient tests positive and $T^-$ be the event that a patient tests negative.\n\nThe givens can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The disease prevalence is $P(D) = 0.2$. The probability of a patient not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\n- The sensitivity is the true positive rate: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.9$.\n- The specificity is the true negative rate: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nFrom these, we can determine the false negative rate and the false positive rate:\n- False negative rate: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\n- False positive rate: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nTo calculate the predictive values, we first need the overall probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, and a negative test, $P(T^-)$, in this population. We use the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n$$P(T^+) = (0.9)(0.2) + (0.05)(0.8) = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22$$\nThe total probability of a positive test is $0.22$. This is the proportion of the referred population that will be eligible for enrollment under the enrichment strategy.\n\nSimilarly, for a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n$$P(T^-) = (0.1)(0.2) + (0.95)(0.8) = 0.02 + 0.76 = 0.78$$\nAs a check, $P(T^+) + P(T^-) = 0.22 + 0.78 = 1.0$, which is consistent.\n\nNow we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient who tests positive actually has the disease, $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.9)(0.2)}{0.22} = \\frac{0.18}{0.22} = \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{9}{11}$$\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient who tests negative is truly disease-free, $P(D^c | T^-)$:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.95)(0.8)}{0.78} = \\frac{0.76}{0.78} = \\frac{76}{78} = \\frac{38}{39}$$\n\nThe final task is to calculate the fold-enrichment ratio, $E$. It is defined as the proportion of truly diseased patients among enrolled subjects (test-positives) divided by the baseline disease prevalence. The proportion of diseased patients among the test-positive group is, by definition, the positive predictive value, $P(D | T^+)$. The baseline prevalence is $P(D)$.\n$$E = \\frac{P(D | T^+)}{P(D)}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$E = \\frac{9/11}{0.2} = \\frac{9/11}{1/5} = \\frac{9 \\times 5}{11} = \\frac{45}{11}$$\n\nTo provide the final answer, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$E = \\frac{45}{11} \\approx 4.090909...$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $4.091$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.091}\n$$", "id": "5068002"}, {"introduction": "Once the target patient population is defined, a fundamental question in clinical trial design is determining the necessary sample size.

The primary endpoint is a Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument score measured as change from baseline at a fixed follow-up time.

The minimally important difference, defined through patient-engaged methods, is $\\Delta = 0.3$ on the PRO scale. The trial will use equal allocation, a two-sided Type I error rate $\\alpha = 0.05$, and target power $1 - \\beta = 0.9$ to detect the difference $\\Delta$ between arms.\n\nAssume the following fundamental basis:\n- The sampling distribution of the difference in sample means between two independent arms with equal per-arm sample size $n$ and common standard deviation $\\sigma$ is approximately normal with mean equal to the true difference and standard error $\\sqrt{2}\\,\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, under large-sample conditions justified by the Central Limit Theorem.\n- Type I error (two-sided) is controlled by a critical value corresponding to the upper $\\alpha/2$ quantile of the standard normal distribution, and power is defined as $1-\\beta$ against the alternative where the true difference equals $\\Delta$.\n\nIgnoring attrition, compute the total sample size $N$ required (sum across both arms) for this design. Use a two-sided test, express all intermediate calculations to at least five significant figures, and report the final $N$ as an integer by rounding up to the nearest whole participant. Your final answer must be a single real-valued number with no units.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total sample size $N$ for a two-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial. The analysis begins by establishing the statistical framework for hypothesis testing and then deriving the sample size formula based on the provided parameters.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Standard deviation of the change score in the patient-reported outcome: $\\sigma = 1.2$\n- Minimally important difference to be detected between arms: $\\Delta = 0.3$\n- Two-sided Type I error rate: $\\alpha = 0.05$\n- Desired statistical power: $1 - \\beta = 0.9$\n- Equal allocation to the two arms, with $n$ participants per arm.\n\nThe statistical hypotheses for this superiority trial are:\n- Null hypothesis ($H_0$): There is no difference between the mean change scores of the two arms. Let $\\mu_T$ be the mean for the treatment arm and $\\mu_C$ be the mean for the control/comparator arm. Then, $H_0: \\mu_T - \\mu_C = 0$.\n- Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): There is a difference between the mean change scores. Since the test is two-sided, $H_A: |\\mu_T - \\mu_C| \\neq 0$. For power calculations, we test against the specific alternative that the true difference is the minimally important difference, $\\mu_T - \\mu_C = \\Delta$.\n\nThe test statistic is based on the difference between the sample means, $\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C$. The problem states that this difference is approximately normally distributed. The standard error ($SE$) of the difference, assuming homogeneous variance $\\sigma^2$ and equal sample sizes $n$ per arm, is:\n$$ SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nThe standardized test statistic is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C}{SE} $$\nFor a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nPower ($1-\\beta$) is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the alternative hypothesis is true, i.e., when $\\mu_T - \\mu_C = \\Delta$. Assuming $\\Delta > 0$, the power is dominated by the probability of exceeding the upper critical value:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left( \\frac{\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C}{SE} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\;\\middle|\\; \\mu_T - \\mu_C = \\Delta \\right) $$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the random variable $\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C$ under the alternative hypothesis, where its mean is $\\Delta$:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left( \\frac{(\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C) - \\Delta}{SE} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{SE} \\right) $$\nThe term on the left within the probability is a standard normal variable.
