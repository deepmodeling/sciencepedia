All necessary data are provided, and the premises are consistent with established principles of population genetics. The problem is valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expected total number of individuals with the rare disease RD-X in a demographically stratified population. We begin from the first principles as requested.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of clinically affected individuals in the country. The country's population is partitioned into $3$ disjoint strata, so we can define $X_i$ as the number of affected individuals in stratum $i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The total number of affected individuals is the sum of those in each stratum:\n$$X = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} X_i$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of affected individuals is the sum of the expectations for each stratum:\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{3} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E[X_i]$$\nNow, we must find the expected number of affected individuals, $E[X_i]$, within each stratum $i$. The population of stratum $i$ is $N_i = w_i N$, where $N$ is the total population size and $w_i$ is the population weight of the stratum. For any individual chosen randomly from stratum $i$, the probability of being clinically affected is defined as the disease prevalence in that stratum, let's call it $P_{\\text{aff},i}$. According to the problem statement, this probability is given by:\n$$P_{\\text{aff},i} = \\pi \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$$\nwhere $\\pi$ is the clinical penetrance, $q_i$ is the risk allele frequency, and $F_i$ is the inbreeding coefficient for stratum $i$.\n\nThe number of affected individuals in stratum $i$, $X_i$, can be modeled as a sum of indicator random variables. Let $A_{ij} = 1$ if the $j$-th individual in stratum $i$ is affected, and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise, for $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, N_i\\}$. Then $X_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} A_{ij}$. The expectation of each indicator variable is $E[A_{ij}] = P(A_{ij}=1) = P_{\\text{aff},i}$. Using the linearity of expectation for $X_i$:\n$$E[X_i] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} A_{ij}\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} E[A_{ij}] = N_i \\cdot P_{\\text{aff},i}$$\nSubstituting $N_i = w_i N$ and the expression for $P_{\\text{aff},i}$:\n$$E[X_i] = (w_i N) \\cdot \\pi \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$$\nFinally, the total expected number of affected individuals in the country is the sum over all strata:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i N \\pi \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$$\nFactoring out the constants $N$ and $\\pi$, we get the final expression for our calculation:\n$$E[X] = N \\pi \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $N = 68,000,000$\n- $\\pi = 0.8$\n- Stratum $1$: $w_1 = 0.60$, $q_1 = 0.004$, $F_1 = 0$\n- Stratum $2$: $w_2 = 0.35$, $q_2 = 0.002$, $F_2 = 0.01$\n- Stratum $3$: $w_3 = 0.05$, $q_3 = 0.03$, $F_3 = 0.02$\n\nWe calculate the term inside the summation for each stratum:\nFor stratum $1$:\n$$w_1 \\left(q_1^{2} + F_1 q_1 (1 - q_1)\\right) = 0.60 \\left( (0.004)^{2} + 0 \\cdot (0.004)(1-0.004) \\right) = 0.60 \\cdot (0.000016) = 0.0000096$$\nFor stratum $2$:\n$$w_2 \\left(q_2^{2} + F_2 q_2 (1 - q_2)\\right) = 0.35 \\left( (0.002)^{2} + (0.01)(0.002)(1-0.002) \\right)$$\n$$= 0.35 \\left( 0.000004 + 0.00002 \\cdot 0.998 \\right) = 0.35 \\left( 0.000004 + 0.00001996 \\right) = 0.35 \\cdot (0.00002396) \\approx 0.000008386$$\nFor stratum $3$:\n$$w_3 \\left(q_3^{2} + F_3 q_3 (1 - q_3)\\right) = 0.05 \\left( (0.03)^{2} + (0.02)(0.03)(1-0.03) \\right)$$\n$$= 0.05 \\left( 0.0009 + 0.0006 \\cdot 0.97 \\right) = 0.05 \\left( 0.0009 + 0.000582 \\right) = 0.05 \\cdot (0.001482) = 0.0000741$$\nThe sum of these terms is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\dots) = 0.0000096 + 0.000008386 + 0.0000741 = 0.000092086$$\nThis sum represents the overall population prevalence of the AR homozygous genotype, averaged across strata. Now, we calculate the total expected number of affected individuals:\n$$E[X] = N \\pi \\cdot (0.000092086) = 68,000,000 \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot 0.000092086$$\n$$E[X] = 54,400,000 \\cdot 0.000092086 = 5009.4784$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $5009$.\n\nRegarding the effect of demographic heterogeneity: The aggregated estimate is derived by summing the expected number of cases from each stratum. This approach is necessary because the prevalence of the disease is a non-linear function of the underlying genetic parameters, specifically the allele frequency $q_i$ and the inbreeding coefficient $F_i$. The total expected number of cases is proportional to the weighted average of stratum-specific prevalences, $\\sum w_i P_{\\text{aff},i}$. A naive approach might be to first average the parameters across strata (e.g., $\\bar{q} = \\sum w_i q_i$, $\\bar{F} = \\sum w_i F_i$) and then compute a single prevalence estimate for the entire population. This would be incorrect and yield a different result because, in general, $\\sum w_i f(q_i, F_i) \\neq f(\\sum w_i q_i, \\sum w_i F_i)$ for a non-linear function $f$.\nThe dominant non-linear term is $q_i^2$. Due to the convexity of the function $x \\mapsto x^2$, Jensen's inequality implies that the weighted average of the squares is greater than or equal to the square of the weighted average: $\\sum w_i q_i^2 \\ge (\\sum w_i q_i)^2$. This means that ignoring the stratification and using an average allele frequency will typically underestimate the number of homozygotes (this is known as the Wahlund effect). In this problem, stratum $3$ has a much higher allele frequency ($q_3=0.03$) and inbreeding coefficient ($F_3=0.02$) than the other strata. Although it represents only $5\\%$ of the population, its contribution to the overall genotype prevalence ($0.0000741$) is substantially larger than that of the other two strata combined ($0.0000096 + 0.000008386 = 0.000017986$). Heterogeneity thus allows small, high-risk subpopulations to contribute disproportionately to the total disease burden, an effect that is only captured by the correct stratum-by-stratum aggregation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5009}$$", "id": "5072569"}, {"introduction": "Once the potential burden of a rare disease is estimated, a critical translational challenge is to identify affected individuals, often through population-wide screening.

The problem states that $K$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$\nP(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\quad \\text{for } k=0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nThe enzyme activity in a single hepatocyte, which we can denote as $E$, is a function of $K$. Based on the problem description:\n- If $K=0$ (the cell is not transduced), the activity is $E=0$.\n- If $K \\geq 1$ (the cell is transduced), the activity is $E = \\gamma E_{\\text{norm}}$.\n\nThe mean hepatic enzyme activity, $\\langle E \\rangle$, is the expected value of $E$ over the population of hepatocytes. We can calculate this using the law of total expectation:\n$$\n\\langle E \\rangle = E[E] = (0) \\cdot P(K=0) + (\\gamma E_{\\text{norm}}) \\cdot P(K \\geq 1)\n$$\nThe probability that a hepatocyte receives zero vector genomes ($K=0$) is found from the Poisson distribution:\n$$\nP(K=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 e^{-\\lambda}}{0!} = e^{-\\lambda}\n$$\nThe probability that a hepatocyte receives at least one vector genome is the complement of receiving zero genomes:\n$$\nP(K \\geq 1) = 1 - P(K=0) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda}\n$$\nThis term, $1 - e^{-\\lambda}$, represents the fraction of hepatocytes that are successfully transduced.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the mean activity $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle E \\rangle = (\\gamma E_{\\text{norm}}) (1 - e^{-\\lambda})\n$$\nThe problem states that the mean multiplicity $\\lambda$ is a function of the dose $D$. Specifically, $\\lambda = \\alpha_{\\text{human}} D$, and the human-specific parameter $\\alpha_{\\text{human}}$ is related to the NHP parameter $\\alpha_{\\text{NHP}}$ by the scaling factor $s$: $\\alpha_{\\text{human}} = s \\alpha_{\\text{NHP}}$. Therefore, we can express $\\lambda$ in terms of $D$ and the given preclinical parameters:\n$$\n\\lambda = s \\alpha_{\\text{NHP}} D\n$$\nSubstituting this into our equation for mean activity gives the desired expression for the mean hepatic enzyme activity as a function of dose $D$:\n$$\n\\langle E \\rangle(D) = \\gamma E_{\\text{norm}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-s \\alpha_{\\text{NHP}} D)\\right)\n$$\nThis is the first part of the required derivation.\n\nNext, we must find the minimal dose $D$ such that the mean activity meets or exceeds the therapeutic threshold $\\theta E_{\\text{norm}}$.
