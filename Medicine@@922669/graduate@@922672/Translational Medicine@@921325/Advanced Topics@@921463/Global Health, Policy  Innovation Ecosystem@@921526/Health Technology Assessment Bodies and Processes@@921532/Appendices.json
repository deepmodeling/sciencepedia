The concepts of Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), and willingness-to-pay thresholds are standard, well-defined metrics in this field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($\\Delta C$, $\\Delta E$, $\\lambda$) for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The values provided are plausible within the context of evaluating a new regenerative therapy. No scientific or logical flaws are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first defining and calculating the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and then deriving and applying the appropriate decision rule based on the net-benefit framework.\n\nThe formal definition of the ICER is the ratio of the incremental cost of a new intervention compared to a standard of care, to its incremental health effect. Let the new therapy be intervention $A$ and the standard of care be intervention $B$. The incremental cost is $\\Delta C = C_A - C_B$, and the incremental effect is $\\Delta E = E_A - E_B$. The ICER is thus defined as:\n$$\nICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\Delta E$ is to be treated as strictly positive, which ensures the ICER is well-defined and avoids division by zero.\n\nUsing the provided values, we can compute the ICER:\n$$\n\\Delta C = 50000\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = 1.5\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the definition:\n$$\nICER = \\frac{50000}{1.5} = 33333.\\overline{3}\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $3$, $3$, $3$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down. This means the digits following the fourth significant figure are replaced by zeros.\n$$\nICER \\approx 33330\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine if the therapy is cost-effective by applying the decision rule derived from the net-benefit framework. The net monetary benefit (NMB) of an intervention is defined as $NMB = (\\lambda \\times E) - C$, where $\\lambda$ is the willingness-to-pay threshold for a unit of health effect $E$. A new intervention is considered superior to the standard of care if its incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) is positive.\n$$\nINMB = NMB_A - NMB_B = ((\\lambda \\times E_A) - C_A) - ((\\lambda \\times E_B) - C_B)\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\nINMB = \\lambda(E_A - E_B) - (C_A - C_B) = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n$$\nThe decision rule for cost-effectiveness is $INMB > 0$. Therefore, the therapy is deemed cost-effective if:\n$$\n(\\lambda \\times \\Delta E) - \\Delta C > 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\lambda \\times \\Delta E > \\Delta C\n$$\nSince $\\Delta E > 0$ is given, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $\\Delta E$ without changing its direction:\n$$\n\\lambda > \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nThis establishes the decision rule: a therapy is cost-effective if the willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$, is greater than the ICER.\n\nNow, we apply this rule using the given threshold and the calculated ICER.\n- The willingness-to-pay threshold is $\\lambda = 30000$.\n- The calculated ICER is approximately $33330$.\n\nWe must check if the condition $\\lambda > ICER$ is met.\n$$\n30000 > 33330\n$$\nThis inequality is false. Since the willingness-to-pay threshold is less than the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ($\\lambda < ICER$), the therapy would not be deemed cost-effective under the specified base-case conditions and threshold.\n\nThe problem asks for the ICER as the final numerical answer, rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{33330}$$", "id": "5019035"}, {"introduction": "Real-world healthcare decisions often involve choosing from several mutually exclusive technologies, not just a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" on one.

Define the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). For any technology compared with a reference, the ICER is $ICER = \\Delta C / \\Delta E$, where $\\Delta C$ is the incremental cost and $\\Delta E$ is the incremental effectiveness (for example, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)).\n\n2. Define the willingness-to-pay threshold. The decision-maker’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold $\\lambda$ represents the maximum monetary value per unit of health gain (for example, per QALY) that the health system is prepared to pay.\n\n3. Define net monetary benefit (NMB). For a given $\\lambda$, $NMB = \\lambda \\Delta E - \\Delta C$. Among alternatives, the option with the highest $NMB$ is optimal, provided it lies on the efficiency frontier.\n\n4. Define dominance and extended dominance. A strategy is strictly dominated if it is more costly and less effective than another. A strategy is extendedly dominated if it has a higher ICER than a more effective adjacent alternative when options are ordered by effectiveness and compared incrementally; equivalently, it is dominated by a convex combination of other non-dominated strategies. In practice, extendedly dominated strategies are eliminated because they are never optimal for any $\\lambda$.\n\n5. Correct incremental decision process. The standard algorithm is:\n   - Order strategies by increasing effectiveness.\n   - Eliminate strictly dominated strategies.\n   - Compute incremental ICERs between adjacent remaining strategies.\n   - If an option’s incremental ICER exceeds that of a more effective subsequent option, eliminate it by extended dominance and recompute incremental ICERs.\n   - Once only non-dominated strategies remain, step along the cost-effectiveness frontier comparing each incremental ICER to $\\lambda$ from least to most effective. Adopt the most effective strategy for which the incremental ICER is less than or equal to $\\lambda$. If none meet the threshold, retain the comparator (for example, current care).\n\nApply these principles to the scenario. We are told that $ICER_A = 20{,}000$ per QALY and $ICER_B = 45{,}000$ per QALY relative to current care, and that extended dominance is present when performing proper incremental analysis. The presence of extended dominance implies that at least one of the candidate strategies is eliminated before threshold comparison. Therefore, any correct decision rule must:\n- Explicitly eliminate extendedly dominated options prior to threshold-based adoption, and\n- Compare incremental ICERs along the non-dominated frontier to $\\lambda$ in a stepwise manner, adopting the most effective affordable option; if none are affordable at $\\lambda$, maintain current care.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. “Rank technologies by their ICERs relative to current care and select the one with the lowest ICER that is below $\\lambda$; if both are below $\\lambda$, select the technology with the lower ICER.” This ignores incremental, stepwise comparisons and the requirement to eliminate extended dominance. For example, both technologies could have ICERs below $\\lambda$ relative to current care, yet the more effective option could be affordable compared with the less effective option even if its ICER versus current care is higher. The correct procedure is not to choose the lowest ICER versus current care, but to move along the frontier comparing adjacent incremental ICERs. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. “Remove any strictly dominated or extendedly dominated strategies; then, along the resulting cost-effectiveness frontier, compare the incremental ICERs between adjacent non-dominated options to $\\lambda$, proceeding from least to most effective, and adopt the most effective option for which the incremental ICER does not exceed $\\lambda$; if none satisfy this, retain current care.” This precisely states the accepted decision rule grounded in the definitions of dominance, extended dominance, and threshold-based choice using incremental comparisons and the efficiency frontier. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. “Compute net monetary benefit relative to current care using the provided ICERs as $NMB = \\lambda - ICER$, and since $ICER_A < ICER_B$, adopt Technology A for all $\\lambda$.” This misuses ICERs. Net monetary benefit requires $\\Delta E$ and $\\Delta C$, not just their ratio. One cannot compute $NMB$ from ICER alone as $NMB = \\lambda - ICER$; the correct expression is $NMB = \\lambda \\Delta E - \\Delta C$. Moreover, even if both ICERs are known, the optimal choice depends on incremental comparisons along the efficiency frontier after eliminating extended dominance, not on the smallest ICER versus current care. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. “Adopt Technology B whenever $\\lambda \\ge 45{,}000$ because $ICER_B$ is below $\\lambda$ relative to current care, regardless of whether extended dominance is present.” This ignores extended dominance. If Technology B is extendedly dominated, it is never optimal for any $\\lambda$, even if its ICER versus current care is below $\\lambda$. The proper rule is to remove extendedly dominated options first and then compare incremental ICERs along the frontier. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. “When extended dominance is present, average the two ICERs and adopt the technology whose ICER is closer to the average, because this minimizes regret under uncertainty.” This has no basis in HTA decision rules. ICER averaging is not a valid criterion, and minimizing regret in this manner is unrelated to the established framework of dominance, extended dominance, and threshold-based incremental comparisons.
