A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the linear form for $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A, X]$**\n\nThe problem states that the conditional expectation of the outcome $Y$ given the treatment assignment $A$ and the covariate $X$ is linear in all first-order terms permitted by these variables. Since both $A$ and $X$ are binary variables, taking values in $\\{0, 1\\}$, a general linear model for $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A, X]$ includes an intercept term, main effects for $A$ and $X$, and a first-order interaction term, $A \\cdot X$. Let the coefficients for these terms be $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2,$ and $\\beta_3$, respectively. The most general form is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A, X] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 A + \\beta_2 X + \\beta_3 (A \\cdot X)\n$$\nThis model is saturated, meaning it can perfectly represent the mean of $Y$ for each of the four possible combinations of $(A, X)$.\n\n**Part 2: Expression for the conditional average treatment effect $\\tau(x)$**\n\nThe conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for a given level of the covariate $X=x$ is defined as $\\tau(x) \\equiv \\mathbb{E}[Y(1)-Y(0) \\mid X=x]$. By the linearity of expectation, this can be written as:\n$$\n\\tau(x) = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \\mid X=x] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) \\mid X=x]\n$$\nThe problem states the assumption of conditional unconfoundedness, $\\{Y(1),Y(0)\\} \\perp A \\mid X$. This assumption allows us to identify the conditional means of the potential outcomes from the conditional means of the observed outcomes. Specifically, for any treatment level $a \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and covariate level $x \\in \\{0, 1\\}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(a) \\mid X=x] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(a) \\mid A=a, X=x]\n$$\nBy the consistency assumption ($Y=Y(A)$), we have $\\mathbb{E}[Y(a) \\mid A=a, X=x] = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=a, X=x]$.\nCombining these results gives the key identification formula:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(a) \\mid X=x] = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=a, X=x]\n$$\nWe can now express $\\tau(x)$ using our linear model for the observed data:\n$$\n\\tau(x) = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=1, X=x] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=0, X=x]\n$$\nWe compute this for each level of $x$:\n\nFor $x=0$ (low ADI neighborhood):\n$$\n\\tau(0) = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=1, X=0] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=0, X=0]\n$$\nUsing our linear model:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=1, X=0] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(1) + \\beta_2(0) + \\beta_3(1 \\cdot 0) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=0, X=0] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(0) + \\beta_2(0) + \\beta_3(0 \\cdot 0) = \\beta_0\n$$\nTherefore, the CATE for the $x=0$ group is:\n$$\n\\tau(0) = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) - \\beta_0 = \\beta_1\n$$\n\nFor $x=1$ (high ADI neighborhood):\n$$\n\\tau(1) = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=1, X=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=0, X=1]\n$$\nUsing our linear model:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=1, X=1] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(1) + \\beta_2(1) + \\beta_3(1 \\cdot 1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=0, X=1] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(0) + \\beta_2(1) + \\beta_3(0 \\cdot 1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2\n$$\nTherefore, the CATE for the $x=1$ group is:\n$$\n\\tau(1) = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_2) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3\n$$\nThe coefficient $\\beta_1$ represents the average treatment effect in the reference group ($X=0$), and $\\beta_3$ represents the additional effect of the treatment in the $X=1$ group compared to the $X=0$ group.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the heterogeneity contrast $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{HTE}}$**\n\nThe heterogeneity contrast, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{HTE}}$, is defined as the difference between the conditional average treatment effects in the two strata of $X$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{HTE}} \\equiv \\tau(1) - \\tau(0)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\tau(1)$ and $\\tau(0)$ derived in Part 2:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{HTE}} = (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3) - (\\beta_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{HTE}} = \\beta_3\n$$\nThis result shows that the heterogeneity contrast, which measures how the treatment effect differs by ADI status, is captured precisely by the interaction coefficient $\\beta_3$ in the linear model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\beta_3}$$", "id": "4987570"}, {"introduction": "Interventions designed to reduce health disparities are frequently implemented at the level of clinics, schools, or communities, which calls for cluster randomized trial designs.

We can derive expressions for these using Bayes' theorem and the provided parameters. All subsequent probabilities are implicitly conditional on $G=g$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(A=k \\mid \\tilde{A}=a, G=g) = \\frac{P(\\tilde{A}=a \\mid A=k, G=g) P(A=k \\mid G=g)}{P(\\tilde{A}=a \\mid G=g)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(\\tilde{A}=a \\mid G=g)$, is the prevalence of the measured exposure status $\\tilde{A}=a$ in group $g$. We expand it using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(\\tilde{A}=a \\mid G=g) = P(\\tilde{A}=a \\mid A=1, G=g) P(A=1 \\mid G=g) + P(\\tilde{A}=a \\mid A=0, G=g) P(A=0 \\mid G=g) $$\nWe are given:\n- $p_g = P(A=1 \\mid G=g)$, so $P(A=0 \\mid G=g) = 1-p_g$.\n- $s_g = P(\\tilde{A}=1 \\mid A=1, G=g)$, so $P(\\tilde{A}=0 \\mid A=1, G=g) = 1-s_g$.\n- $f_g = P(\\tilde{A}=1 \\mid A=0, G=g)$, so $P(\\tilde{A}=0 \\mid A=0, G=g) = 1-f_g = c_g$.\n\nLet's derive the expressions for the two cases of $\\tilde{A}$.\n\nCase 1: $\\tilde{A}=1$ (observed exposure is present)\nThe prevalence of observed exposure is:\n$$ P(\\tilde{A}=1 \\mid G=g) = s_g p_g + f_g (1-p_g) $$\nThe positive predictive value ($PPV_g$) is:\n$$ PPV_g = P(A=1 \\mid \\tilde{A}=1, G=g) = \\frac{s_g p_g}{s_g p_g + f_g (1-p_g)} $$\nAnd $P(A=0 \\mid \\tilde{A}=1, G=g) = 1 - PPV_g = \\frac{f_g(1-p_g)}{s_g p_g + f_g (1-p_g)}$.\nThus, the observed risk among the exposed is:\n$$ P(Y=1 \\mid \\tilde{A}=1, G=g) = R_{1g} \\cdot PPV_g + R_{0g} \\cdot (1-PPV_g) = \\frac{R_{1g} s_g p_g + R_{0g} f_g (1-p_g)}{s_g p_g + f_g (1-p_g)} $$\n\nCase 2: $\\tilde{A}=0$ (observed exposure is absent)\nThe prevalence of observed non-exposure is:\n$$ P(\\tilde{A}=0 \\mid G=g) = (1-s_g)p_g + (1-f_g)(1-p_g) $$\nThe negative predictive value ($NPV_g$) is:\n$$ NPV_g = P(A=0 \\mid \\tilde{A}=0, G=g) = \\frac{(1-f_g)(1-p_g)}{(1-s_g)p_g + (1-f_g)(1-p_g)} $$\nAnd $P(A=1 \\mid \\tilde{A}=0, G=g) = 1 - NPV_g = \\frac{(1-s_g)p_g}{(1-s_g)p_g + (1-f_g)(1-p_g)}$.\nThus, the observed risk among the unexposed is:\n$$ P(Y=1 \\mid \\tilde{A}=0, G=g) = R_{1g} \\cdot (1-NPV_g) + R_{0g} \\cdot NPV_g = \\frac{R_{1g}(1-s_g)p_g + R_{0g}(1-f_g)(1-p_g)}{(1-s_g)p_g + (1-f_g)(1-p_g)} $$\n\nWith these general forms, we can write the observed interaction contrast $\\mathrm{IC}_{\\tilde{A},G}$. Let $\\tilde{R}_{ag} = P(Y=1 \\mid \\tilde{A}=a, G=g)$.\n$$ \\mathrm{IC}_{\\tilde{A},G} = \\tilde{R}_{11} - \\tilde{R}_{10} - \\tilde{R}_{01} + \\tilde{R}_{00} $$\nThis expression, substituting the derived formulae for each $\\tilde{R}_{ag}$, is the complete analytical solution.
