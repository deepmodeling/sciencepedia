The principles of cost-effectiveness analysis, a cornerstone of health technology assessment, will be used.\n\nFirst, the relevant variables are defined based on the problem statement.\nLet $C_{nano}$ be the total cost of the nanomedicine therapy.\nLet $E_{nano}$ be the effectiveness of the nanomedicine therapy, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).\nLet $C_{std}$ be the total cost of the standard care therapy.\nLet $E_{std}$ be the effectiveness of the standard care therapy, also in QALYs.\n\nThe values provided in the problem are:\n$C_{nano} = \\$80,000$\n$E_{nano} = 0.6$\n$C_{std} = \\$20,000$\n$E_{std} = 0.3$\n\nThe Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio ($ICER$) is defined as the ratio of the change in costs to the change in health outcomes (effectiveness) between two interventions. The formula, based on first principles, is:\n$$ICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_{\\text{new}} - C_{\\text{standard}}}{E_{\\text{new}} - E_{\\text{standard}}}$$\nApplying this to the given problem, with nanomedicine as the new intervention and standard care as the comparison:\n$$ICER = \\frac{C_{nano} - C_{std}}{E_{nano} - E_{std}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, and the incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta E$.\nThe incremental cost is the difference between the cost of the nanomedicine and the cost of standard care:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{nano} - C_{std} = \\$80,000 - \\$20,000 = \\$60,000$$\nThe incremental effectiveness is the difference in QALYs gained from the two therapies:\n$$\\Delta E = E_{nano} - E_{std} = 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3$$\n\nNow, we can compute the value of the $ICER$:\n$$ICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{\\$60,000}{0.3 \\text{ QALYs}}$$\n$$ICER = \\$200,000 \\text{ per QALY}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.

To unambiguously represent this value with four significant figures, we use scientific notation: $2.000 \\times 10^{5}$.\n\nThe final step is to determine if the nanomedicine therapy is cost-effective. An intervention is generally considered cost-effective if its $ICER$ is less than or equal to the societal willingness-to-pay ($WTP$) threshold.\nThe given $WTP$ threshold is $\\$100,000$ per QALY.\nWe compare the calculated $ICER$ to the $WTP$:\n$$ICER = \\$200,000 \\text{ per QALY}$$\n$$WTP = \\$100,000 \\text{ per QALY}$$\nSince $\\$200,000 > \\$100,000$, the $ICER$ for the nanomedicine therapy exceeds the societal willingness-to-pay threshold.
