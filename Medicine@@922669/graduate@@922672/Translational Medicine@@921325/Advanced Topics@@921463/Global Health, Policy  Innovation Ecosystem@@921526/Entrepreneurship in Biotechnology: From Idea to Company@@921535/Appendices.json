There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed to solve it.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to find the posterior probability of true efficacy given a positive assay result, denoted as $P(T|+)$. We begin with Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{P(+|T) P(T)}{P(+)}\n$$\nThe terms in the numerator are given directly by the problem statement:\n1.  $P(+|T)$ is the sensitivity of the assay, $Se$.\n2.  $P(T)$ is the prior probability of true efficacy, $p$.\n\nSo, the numerator is $Se \\cdot p$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of observing a positive result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, conditioning on whether the candidate has true efficacy ($T$) or not ($\\neg T$):\n$$\nP(+) = P(+|T)P(T) + P(+|\\neg T)P(\\neg T)\n$$\nWe need to express each term in this expansion using the given variables $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$.\n-   $P(+|T) = Se$ (given by the definition of sensitivity).\n-   $P(T) = p$ (given as the prior probability).\n-   $P(\\neg T)$ is the probability that the candidate does not have true efficacy, which is $1 - P(T) = 1 - p$.\n-   $P(+|\\neg T)$ is the probability of a positive result given no true efficacy (a false positive). This is related to the specificity, $Sp = P(-|\\neg T)$. Since an assay result is either positive or negative, $P(+|\\neg T) + P(-|\\neg T) = 1$. Therefore, the false positive rate is $P(+|\\neg T) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(+)$:\n$$\nP(+) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into Bayes' theorem to get the final general formula for the posterior probability $P(T|+)$:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the posterior probability in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given case:\n-   $Se = 0.80$\n-   $Sp = 0.90$\n-   $p = 0.20$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{(0.80)(0.20)}{(0.80)(0.20) + (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.20)}\n$$\nLet's calculate the components of the expression.\nThe numerator is:\n$$\nSe \\cdot p = 0.80 \\times 0.20 = 0.16\n$$\nThe first term in the denominator is the same as the numerator:\n$$\nSe \\cdot p = 0.16\n$$\nThe second term in the denominator is:\n$$\n(1 - Sp)(1 - p) = (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.20) = (0.10)(0.80) = 0.08\n$$\nThe total denominator is the sum of these two terms:\n$$\nP(+) = 0.16 + 0.08 = 0.24\n$$\nFinally, the posterior probability is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{0.16}{0.24}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{16}{24} = \\frac{2 \\times 8}{3 \\times 8} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.6667$.\n\nThus, after observing a positive result from an assay with $80\\%$ sensitivity and $90\\%$ specificity, the venture team's belief in the candidate's true efficacy should be updated from a prior of $20\\%$ to a posterior of approximately $66.67\\%$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6667}\n$$", "id": "5012614"}, {"introduction": "Once a promising candidate is identified, securing capital becomes the next critical hurdle.

Finally, evaluate $P^{\\ast}$ numerically for the parameter values\n$$\\pi = 0.20,\\quad Se = 0.92,\\quad Sp = 0.96,\\quad B = 8.0\\times 10^{4},\\quad C_T = 4.5\\times 10^{4},\\quad M = 6.0\\times 10^{4}.$$\nExpress your final answer as the break-even test price in United States dollars and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing a complete and consistent set of definitions and parameters to derive the required quantities. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. The prevalence is given as $\\pi = P(D)$, so $P(D^c) = 1 - \\pi$.\nLet $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given diagnostic performance characteristics are:\n- Sensitivity: $Se = P(T^+ | D)$\n- Specificity: $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive the probabilities of the other two conditional outcomes:\n- False Negative Rate: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se$\n- False Positive Rate: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions for Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$).\n\n$PPV$ is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, $P(D|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) = Se \\cdot \\pi + (1-Sp)(1-\\pi)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1-Sp)(1-\\pi)}$$\n\n$NPV$ is the probability that a patient is disease-free given a negative test result, $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) = (1-Se)\\pi + Sp(1-\\pi)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp(1-\\pi)}{(1-Se)\\pi + Sp(1-\\pi)}$$\n\nNext, we compute the expected net value to the payer per tested patient, $E[V]$. The value is determined by the four possible outcomes: True Positive ($TP$), False Positive ($FP$), False Negative ($FN$), and True Negative ($TN$). The probability of each of these joint events is:\n- $P(TP) = P(T^+ \\cap D) = P(T^+|D)P(D) = Se \\cdot \\pi$\n- $P(FP) = P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) = (1-Sp)(1-\\pi)$\n- $P(FN) = P(T^- \\cap D) = P(T^-|D)P(D) = (1-Se)\\pi$\n- $P(TN) = P(T^- \\cap D^c) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) = Sp(1-\\pi)$\n\nThe net financial effect (value) for the payer for each outcome is given as:\n- Value($TP$): $B - C_T$ (benefit $B$ is realized, therapy cost $C_T$ is incurred)\n- Value($FP$): $-C_T$ (therapy cost $C_T$ is incurred with no benefit)\n- Value($FN$): $-M$ (opportunity to realize benefit is missed, cost $M$ is incurred)\n- Value($TN$): $0$ (no change in cost or benefit)\n\nThe test price, $P$, is paid for every patient. The expected net value $E[V]$ is the sum of the products of each outcome's probability and its value, minus the cost of the test:\n$$E[V] = P(TP) \\cdot (B - C_T) + P(FP) \\cdot (-C_T) + P(FN) \\cdot (-M) + P(TN) \\cdot (0) - P$$\nSubstituting the probability expressions:\n$$E[V] = (Se \\cdot \\pi)(B - C_T) - ((1-Sp)(1-\\pi))C_T - ((1-Se)\\pi)M - P$$\n\nTo find the break-even price, $P^{\\ast}$, we set the expected net value to zero, $E[V] = 0$, and solve for $P=P^{\\ast}$:\n$$0 = (Se \\cdot \\pi)(B - C_T) - (1-Sp)(1-\\pi)C_T - (1-Se)\\pi M - P^{\\ast}$$\n$$P^{\\ast} = Se \\cdot \\pi (B - C_T) - (1-Sp)(1-\\pi)C_T - (1-Se)\\pi M$$\nThis equation represents the maximum price the payer would be willing to pay for the test, as it is the expected value generated by the clinical and economic outcomes resulting from the test's use.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $P^{\\ast}$ numerically with the given parameter values:\n- $\\pi = 0.20$\n- $Se = 0.92$\n- $Sp = 0.96$\n- $B = 8.0 \\times 10^{4}$\n- $C_T = 4.5 \\times 10^{4}$\n- $M = 6.0 \\times 10^{4}$\n\nWe also compute the derived parameters:\n- $1-\\pi = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n- $1-Se = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$\n- $1-Sp = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04$\n- $B - C_T = 8.0 \\times 10^{4} - 4.5 \\times 10^{4} = 3.5 \\times 10^{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$P^{\\ast} = (0.92)(0.20)(3.5 \\times 10^{4}) - (0.04)(0.80)(4.5 \\times 10^{4}) - (0.08)(0.20)(6.0 \\times 10^{4})$$\n$$P^{\\ast} = (0.184)(35000) - (0.032)(45000) - (0.016)(60000)$$\n$$P^{\\ast} = 6440 - 1440 - 960$$\n$$P^{\\ast} = 5000 - 960$$\n$$P^{\\ast} = 4040$$\n\nThe calculated break-even price is exactly $4040$ United States dollars. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact answer, $4040$, when expressed to four significant figures, is $4.040 \\times 10^3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.040 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "5012628"}]}
