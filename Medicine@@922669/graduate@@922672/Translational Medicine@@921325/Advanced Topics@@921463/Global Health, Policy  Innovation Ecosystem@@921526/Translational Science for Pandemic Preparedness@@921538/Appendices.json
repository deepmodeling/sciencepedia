Assume there is a large screening cohort of size $N$ in which each individual has independent infection probability $p$, and that analytic validation has confirmed that, for the group sizes considered, pooling does not degrade sensitivity or specificity relative to individual tests. In the first stage, the laboratory tests pooled specimens formed by partitioning the $N$ individuals into groups of equal size $g \\in \\mathbb{N}$; one pooled test is run per group.

Finally, quantify the efficiency gain of the optimal pooled strategy relative to individual testing, defined as the ratio of the expected number of tests under individual testing to the expected number of tests under the pooled strategy at the optimal $g$. Report the optimal $g$ and the efficiency gain. Round the efficiency gain to four significant figures. Express the efficiency gain as a dimensionless number (no units).", "solution": "First, we derive the closed-form expression for the expected number of tests per individual, $E[T](g,p)$.\nThe screening protocol involves two stages. We consider a cohort of $N$ individuals, partitioned into $\\frac{N}{g}$ groups of size $g$. The infection status of each individual is an independent Bernoulli trial, with probability of being infected equal to $p$.\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual is not infected is $1-p$.\nA group of size $g$ tests negative in the first stage if and only if all $g$ individuals in that group are not infected. Due to the independence assumption, the probability of a group testing negative is $(1-p)^g$.\n\nA group tests positive in the first stage if at least one individual is infected. The probability of this event, which we denote as $P_{\\text{pos}}$, is the complement of the group testing negative:\n$$P_{\\text{pos}} = 1 - (1-p)^g$$\n\nThe total number of tests, $T_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of tests from Stage 1 and Stage 2.\nIn Stage 1, one test is run for each of the $\\frac{N}{g}$ groups. So, the number of Stage 1 tests is deterministically $\\frac{N}{g}$.\nIn Stage 2, individual tests are performed for all $g$ members of each group that tested positive in Stage 1. Let $K$ be the random variable for the number of positive groups. The number of Stage 2 tests is $gK$.\n\nThe total number of tests is $T_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{N}{g} + gK$.\nWe need the expected total number of tests, $E[T_{\\text{total}}]$. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = E\\left[\\frac{N}{g} + gK\\right] = \\frac{N}{g} + gE[K]$$\nThe number of positive groups, $K$, follows a binomial distribution, $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}\\left(n=\\frac{N}{g}, q=P_{\\text{pos}}\\right)$, since each of the $\\frac{N}{g}$ groups represents an independent trial. The expected value of a binomial distribution is $nq$. Thus, the expected number of positive groups is:\n$$E[K] = \\frac{N}{g} \\times P_{\\text{pos}} = \\frac{N}{g}\\left(1 - (1-p)^g\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E[T_{\\text{total}}]$:\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = \\frac{N}{g} + g\\left[\\frac{N}{g}\\left(1 - (1-p)^g\\right)\\right] = \\frac{N}{g} + N\\left(1 - (1-p)^g\\right)$$\nThe problem asks for the expected number of tests per individual, $E[T](g,p)$, which is $E[T_{\\text{total}}]$ divided by the total number of individuals, $N$:\n$$E[T](g,p) = \\frac{E[T_{\\text{total}}]}{N} = \\frac{1}{N}\\left(\\frac{N}{g} + N\\left(1 - (1-p)^g\\right)\\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the required closed form:\n$$E[T](g,p) = \\frac{1}{g} + 1 - (1-p)^g$$\n\nSecond, we determine the optimal integer group size $g$ that minimizes $E[T](g,p)$ for $p=0.01$.\nThe function to minimize is:\n$$f(g) = E[T](g, 0.01) = \\frac{1}{g} + 1 - (0.99)^g$$\nwhere $g$ is an integer $g \\ge 2$. To find the approximate location of the minimum, we can treat $g$ as a continuous variable and find where the derivative is zero.\n$$f'(g) = -\\frac{1}{g^2} - (0.99)^g \\ln(0.99) = 0$$\nThis leads to the equation $g^2 (0.99)^g = -1/\\ln(0.99)$. A common approximation for small $p$ is $g_{\\text{opt}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p}}$. For $p=0.01$, this gives $g_{\\text{opt}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.01}} = \\frac{1}{0.1} = 10$. This suggests the true integer minimum is close to 10. We test integer values of $g$ in this vicinity.\nFor $g=10$:\n$$E[T](10, 0.01) = \\frac{1}{10} + 1 - (0.99)^{10} \\approx 0.1 + 1 - 0.904382075 \\approx 0.195617925$$\nFor $g=11$:\n$$E[T](11, 0.01) = \\frac{1}{11} + 1 - (0.99)^{11} \\approx 0.090909091 + 1 - 0.895338254 \\approx 0.195570837$$\nFor $g=12$:\n$$E[T](12, 0.01) = \\frac{1}{12} + 1 - (0.99)^{12} \\approx 0.083333333 + 1 - 0.886384871 \\approx 0.196948462$$\nComparing these values, $E[T](g, 0.01)$ is smallest for $g=11$. Thus, the optimal integer group size is $g_{\\text{opt}} = 11$.\n\nFinally, we quantify the efficiency gain. This is the ratio of the expected number of tests for individual testing to that of the optimal pooled strategy.\nThe expected number of tests per individual for individual testing is 1.\nThe expected number of tests per individual for the optimal pooled strategy is $E[T](11, 0.01) \\approx 0.195570837$.\nThe efficiency gain, $\\eta$, is:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{1}{E[T](11, 0.01)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{11} + 1 - (0.99)^{11}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.195570837} \\approx 5.113238$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the efficiency gain is 5.113.\n\nThe two results requested are the optimal group size, 11, and the efficiency gain, 5.113.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 11 & 5.113 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5073896"}, {"introduction": "A central goal of any vaccination campaign is to achieve herd immunity, thereby protecting the entire population.
