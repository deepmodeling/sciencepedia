For a particular serum tube drawn from whole blood, the HI corresponds to an estimated Red Blood Cells (RBCs) lysis fraction of $0.5\\%$. Assume the following scientifically grounded base facts and definitions:\n\n- Hematocrit $H$ is defined as the fraction of whole blood volume occupied by RBCs. For this specimen, $H=0.45$.\n- The intracellular potassium concentration in RBC cytosol is approximately $C_{\\mathrm{i}}=120\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Concentration is defined as moles per unit volume, and conservation of mass applies (no chemical reactions consuming or producing potassium).\n- In a simple mixing model for preanalytical hemolysis, a fraction $f$ of the RBC volume lyses and its intracellular fluid (containing potassium at concentration $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$) is transferred entirely into the acellular supernatant measured as serum, while intact RBCs are removed by centrifugation.
