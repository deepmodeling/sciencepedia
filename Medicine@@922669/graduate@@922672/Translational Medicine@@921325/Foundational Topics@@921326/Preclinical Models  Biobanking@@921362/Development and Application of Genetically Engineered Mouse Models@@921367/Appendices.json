Consider two autosomal, unlinked loci: a floxed locus with alleles $F$ (floxed) and $f$ (wild-type), and a Cre locus with alleles $C$ (Cre transgene present) and $c$ (Cre transgene absent). One parent is a heterozygous floxed Cre driver mouse with genotype $F/f; C/c$, and the other parent is a heterozygous floxed non-driver mouse with genotype $F/f; c/c$. Assume Mendelian segregation at each locus, independent assortment (no linkage), random mating, and no segregation distortion.\n\nEmpirically, embryos that are homozygous floxed and Cre-positive (genotype $F/F; C/c$) suffer incomplete embryonic lethality due to essential gene ablation.

Under these assumptions, derive the exact analytic expression for the expected fraction of live-born offspring that have genotype $F/F; C/c$. Express your final answer as a simplified closed-form function of $s$ without units, using a fraction or decimal as appropriate. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and grounded in the principles of Mendelian genetics and the common application of the Cre-loxP system in mouse models. It provides a clear set of initial conditions and an unambiguous objective. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem involves a standard dihybrid cross with a selection factor applied to one of the resulting genotypes. The two parent mice have the following genotypes:\nParent 1: Heterozygous floxed Cre driver, genotype $F/f; C/c$.\nParent 2: Heterozygous floxed non-driver, genotype $F/f; c/c$.\n\nThe loci are autosomal and unlinked, which implies independent assortment of the alleles at the floxed locus ($F, f$) and the Cre locus ($C, c$). We can therefore analyze the inheritance of each locus separately and combine the probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's determine the frequencies of genotypes for the floxed locus from the cross $F/f \\times F/f$. According to Mendelian principles, the expected genotypic ratio in the offspring is $1:2:1$.\nThe probabilities for each genotype are:\n-   Probability of homozygous floxed, $P(F/F) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Probability of heterozygous floxed, $P(F/f) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Probability of wild-type, $P(f/f) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nNext, let's determine the frequencies of genotypes for the Cre locus from the cross $C/c \\times c/c$. This is a test cross, and the expected genotypic ratio is $1:1$.\nThe probabilities for each genotype are:\n-   Probability of Cre-positive, $P(C/c) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Probability of Cre-negative, $P(c/c) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSince the two loci assort independently, the probability of any specific two-locus genotype in the zygotes (at conception, before any lethality) is the product of the probabilities of the single-locus genotypes.\nWe are interested in the genotype $F/F; C/c$. Its expected frequency at conception is:\n$$ P(F/F; C/c) = P(F/F) \\times P(C/c) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\nThis means that, on average, 1 out of every 8 embryos conceived will have the genotype $F/F; C/c$.\n\nThe problem states that embryos with genotype $F/F; C/c$ exhibit incomplete embryonic lethality with a survival probability of $1 - s$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient against this genotype. All other genotypes have a survival probability of $1$.\n\nTo find the fraction of *live-born* offspring with the $F/F; C/c$ genotype, we must calculate the proportion of such embryos that survive and divide it by the total proportion of all embryos that survive.\n\nLet's calculate the total survival probability of the entire cohort of offspring, which we can denote as $W$. The frequency of the genotype $F/F; C/c$ is $1/8$, and the combined frequency of all other genotypes is $1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\nThe total survival probability is the weighted average of the survival probabilities of all possible genotypes, where the weights are their initial frequencies:\n$$ W = \\left( P(F/F; C/c) \\times \\text{Survival}(F/F; C/c) \\right) + \\left( (1 - P(F/F; C/c)) \\times \\text{Survival}(\\text{other}) \\right) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ W = \\left( \\frac{1}{8} \\right) \\times (1 - s) + \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right) \\times (1) $$\n$$ W = \\frac{1-s}{8} + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{1-s+7}{8} = \\frac{8-s}{8} $$\nThis value, $W$, represents the fraction of the total conceived embryos that are expected to result in a live birth.\n\nNow, we calculate the proportion of surviving offspring that have the genotype $F/F; C/c$. This is the initial frequency of the genotype multiplied by its survival probability, all normalized by the total survival $W$:\n$$ \\text{Fraction}(F/F; C/c)_{\\text{live-born}} = \\frac{P(F/F; C/c) \\times \\text{Survival}(F/F; C/c)}{W} $$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$ \\text{Fraction}(F/F; C/c)_{\\text{live-born}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} (1 - s)}{\\frac{8-s}{8}} $$\nThe factor of $1/8$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, yielding the final simplified expression:\n$$ \\text{Fraction}(F/F; C/c)_{\\text{live-born}} = \\frac{1 - s}{8 - s} $$\nThis is the exact analytic expression for the expected fraction of live-born offspring with genotype $F/F; C/c$ as a function of the selection coefficient $s$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1-s}{8-s}} $$", "id": "5007247"}, {"introduction": "Once the desired GEMMs are generated, the focus shifts to designing experiments that can yield clear and reliable answers.

A total of $n=24$ mice will be enrolled at $t=8$ weeks after Cre activation and assigned to drug versus vehicle ($n_1=n_0=12$). Mice come from $6$ litters (each litter contributes $4$ siblings), are housed $2$ per cage (thus $12$ cages), and are imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on $3$ consecutive days to quantify total tumor volume. The team is concerned about potential litter, cage, and day-of-imaging effects on the outcome, as well as experimenter influences during animal handling and outcome assessment.\n\nUse first principles of experimental design and unbiased estimation to reason about how study procedures affect the expectation and variance of the estimated treatment effect. In particular, consider the following conceptual model for the continuous outcome $Y_{i}$ (tumor volume) for mouse $i$:\n$$\nY_i = \\mu + \\tau T_i + \\lambda_{L(i)} + \\kappa_{C(i)} + \\beta_{B(i)} + \\epsilon_i,\n$$\nwhere $T_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicates assignment to drug, $\\lambda_{L(i)}$ is a litter effect, $\\kappa_{C(i)}$ is a cage effect, $\\beta_{B(i)}$ is a batch (imaging day) effect, and $\\epsilon_i$ is idiosyncratic noise with $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_i]=0$. The measured outcome $\\tilde{Y}_i$ available to the analyst may also include an assessment error $\\delta_i$:\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}_i = Y_i + \\delta_i,\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_i$ may depend on $T_i$ if assessors are not masked.

Randomization is assigning $T_i$ using a chance mechanism that makes $T_i$ independent of baseline prognostic factors (measured or unmeasured); it reduces selection bias and confounding by ensuring $\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda_{L(i)} \\mid T_i=1]=\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda_{L(i)} \\mid T_i=0]$ and similarly for other nuisance terms in expectation. Allocation concealment hides upcoming treatment assignments at the moment of enrollment from those deciding which eligible mouse is assigned next; it prevents foreknowledge from influencing which mouse receives which $T_i$, preserving the independence created by randomization. Blinding masks $T_i$ from caregivers and outcome assessors so that $\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i \\mid T_i=1]=\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i \\mid T_i=0]=0$, reducing observer and performance bias. Blocking groups mice by a known nuisance factor (e.g., litter, cage, or imaging day) and randomizes within blocks (and/or adjusts for blocks in analysis), which reduces the variance of $\\hat{\\tau}$ by removing between-block variability without introducing bias when blocks are associated with outcome.\n\nB. Randomization guarantees identical covariate distributions in each arm in finite samples, so blocking is unnecessary.

Alternating assignment as mice become eligible (ABAB...) is a valid form of randomization; if used, allocation concealment is unnecessary. Blinding can be harmful by adding extra measurement noise $\\delta_i$, thereby increasing bias. Blocking increases the Type I error rate by reducing the effective degrees of freedom and should be avoided when between-block variability is present.\n\nD. In GEMMs, because genotype is fixed and cohorts can be composed of littermates, randomization is not needed if all animals are drawn from the same breeding pipeline; allocation concealment is only relevant in human trials. Blinding should focus on outcome assessors to avoid differential measurement error, and blocking can be implemented analytically by including litter or batch as a factor to improve precision.\n\nE. Randomization reduces bias only when sample size $n \\to \\infty$; with small GEMM cohorts (e.g., $n \\approx 8$ per arm), it is preferable to match mice on body weight without randomization.

The specified GEMM (the \"KPC\" model) is a standard and highly relevant model for pancreatic cancer research. The experimental setup, including drug vs. vehicle, MRI-based endpoints, and consideration of litter/cage/batch effects, is representative of rigorous preclinical studies. The statistical model is a classical linear model for analyzing sources of variation, a fundamental concept in biostatistics. The principles to be evaluated (randomization, blinding, etc.) are cornerstones of experimental design.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The provided information is sufficient and self-contained for judging the correctness of the statements in the options.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is objective. It uses precise, technical language and refers to concepts with established, formal definitions in statistics and experimental science.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides a realistic scenario to test understanding of fundamental principles of experimental design. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe goal is to estimate the average treatment effect $\\tau$ using the estimator $\\hat{\\tau} = \\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=1} - \\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=0}$. The quality of this estimator depends on its bias and variance.\n\n**1. Bias Analysis**\nThe expectation of the estimator is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=1} - \\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=0}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=1}] - \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=0}] $$\nSubstituting the models for $\\tilde{Y}_i$ and $Y_i$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=1}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{1}{n_1} \\sum_{i:T_i=1} (\\mu + \\tau + \\lambda_{L(i)} + \\kappa_{C(i)} + \\beta_{B(i)} + \\epsilon_i + \\delta_i) \\right] $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=0}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{1}{n_0} \\sum_{i:T_i=0} (\\mu + \\lambda_{L(i)} + \\kappa_{C(i)} + \\beta_{B(i)} + \\epsilon_i + \\delta_i) \\right] $$\nTaking the difference gives the expected value of the estimator:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\tau}] = \\tau + (\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\lambda}_{T=1}] - \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\lambda}_{T=0}]) + (\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\kappa}_{T=1}] - \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\kappa}_{T=0}]) + (\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\beta}_{T=1}] - \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\beta}_{T=0}]) + (\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\delta}_{T=1}] - \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\delta}_{T=0}]) $$\nThe bias of the estimator is $\\text{Bias}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\tau}] - \\tau$. For $\\hat{\\tau}$ to be an unbiased estimator of $\\tau$, the sum of the parenthetical terms must be zero.\n\n-   **Randomization**: This is the use of a formal chance process (e.g., a coin flip or random number generator) to assign experimental units to treatment groups. This makes the treatment assignment $T_i$ statistically independent of all other pre-existing variables, whether measured or unmeasured. These include prognostic factors like litter of origin ($\\lambda_{L(i)}$), initial health, etc. By ensuring this independence, randomization guarantees that, in expectation, the distribution of these factors is the same across treatment groups. This means $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\lambda}_{T=1}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\lambda}_{T=0}]$, $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\kappa}_{T=1}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\kappa}_{T=0}]$ (for cage effects determined at baseline), etc. Thus, randomization eliminates selection bias and confounding on average.\n-   **Allocation Concealment**: This is the process of hiding the randomization sequence from those who enroll and assign units to treatments until the moment of assignment. Without it, an experimenter knowing the next assignment is \"drug\" might subconsciously choose a sicker-looking mouse, breaking the independence that randomization is meant to create. Allocation concealment is essential to protect the integrity of the randomization process and prevent the re-introduction of selection bias.\n-   **Blinding (or Masking)**: This involves keeping experimenters (e.g., animal handlers) and/or outcome assessors unaware of the treatment assignment $T_i$ *after* randomization. Blinding of assessors prevents *observer bias* by ensuring that measurement error $\\delta_i$ is not systematically related to treatment status. That is, it ensures $\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i | T_i=1] = \\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i | T_i=0]$, which makes the term $(\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\delta}_{T=1}] - \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\delta}_{T=0}])$ equal to zero. Blinding of handlers prevents *performance bias*, where animals in different groups are cared for differently, which could introduce a dependency of other effects (e.g., $\\kappa_{C(i)}$) on $T_i$.\n\n**2. Variance Analysis**\nThe variance of the estimator, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\tau})$, determines its precision. Assuming independence between the two groups after randomization and equal group sizes $n_g=12$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=1}) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{\\tilde{Y}}_{T=0}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\tilde{Y}, T=1}}{n_g} + \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\tilde{Y}, T=0}}{n_g} $$\nThe variance of a single observation, $\\sigma^2_{\\tilde{Y}}$, is the sum of the variances of the different components: $\\sigma^2_\\lambda + \\sigma^2_\\kappa + \\sigma^2_\\beta + \\sigma^2_\\epsilon + \\sigma^2_\\delta$ (assuming independence of the components). A large variance in any of these components will inflate $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\tau})$ and reduce statistical power.\n\n-   **Blocking**: This involves grouping experimental units into homogeneous \"blocks\" based on a known factor that is expected to affect the outcome, and then randomizing treatments *within* each block. In this problem, one could block by litter, cage, or imaging day. For instance, within each litter of $4$ mice, one could randomly assign $2$ to drug and $2$ to vehicle. The analysis would then compare drug vs. vehicle *within* litters. This procedure effectively removes the between-block variability (e.g., $\\sigma^2_\\lambda$) from the error variance used to estimate $\\tau$. This reduces the overall variance of $\\hat{\\tau}$, leading to a more precise estimate and increased statistical power. Blocking does not introduce bias; it is a variance-reduction technique that is compatible with and complements randomization.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Randomization is assigning $T_i$ using a chance mechanism that makes $T_i$ independent of baseline prognostic factors (measured or unmeasured); it reduces selection bias and confounding by ensuring $\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda_{L(i)} \\mid T_i=1]=\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda_{L(i)} \\mid T_i=0]$ and similarly for other nuisance terms in expectation. Allocation concealment hides upcoming treatment assignments at the moment of enrollment from those deciding which eligible mouse is assigned next; it prevents foreknowledge from influencing which mouse receives which $T_i$, preserving the independence created by randomization. Blinding masks $T_i$ from caregivers and outcome assessors so that $\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i \\mid T_i=1]=\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i \\mid T_i=0]=0$, reducing observer and performance bias. Blocking groups mice by a known nuisance factor (e.g., litter, cage, or imaging day) and randomizes within blocks (and/or adjusts for blocks in analysis), which reduces the variance of $\\hat{\\tau}$ by removing between-block variability without introducing bias when blocks are associated with outcome.**\nThis option correctly and precisely defines all four principles. It accurately describes the role of randomization and allocation concealment in controlling bias by ensuring prognostic balance *in expectation*. It correctly describes the role of blinding in controlling observer bias by preventing differential measurement error, and its statement $\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i \\mid T_i=1]=\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i \\mid T_i=0]$ is the key condition, with the '...$=0$' part being a reasonable simplification. It correctly identifies the primary role of blocking as variance reduction by removing between-block variability, without introducing bias. All statements are consistent with the first-principles analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Randomization guarantees identical covariate distributions in each arm in finite samples, so blocking is unnecessary. Allocation concealment is synonymous with blinding, both acting after assignment to keep assessors unaware. Blinding primarily increases external validity rather than internal validity. Blocking reduces bias by forcing exact equality of covariate means across arms.**\nThis option contains numerous errors. Randomization does *not* guarantee identical distributions in finite samples, only in expectation. Allocation concealment and blinding are distinct concepts operating at different times. Blinding is a critical tool for *internal* validity, not primarily external validity. While blocking forces balance on the blocking factor, its main purpose is variance reduction, not bias reduction (which is randomization's main job).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Alternating assignment as mice become eligible (ABAB...) is a valid form of randomization; if used, allocation concealment is unnecessary. Blinding can be harmful by adding extra measurement noise $\\delta_i$, thereby increasing bias. Blinding does not add noise; it prevents existing noise from becoming a source of bias. Blocking increases the Type I error rate by reducing the effective degrees of freedom and should be avoided when between-block variability is present.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Alternating assignment is systematic and predictable, not random, and therefore lacks allocation concealment. Blinding does not add noise; it prevents existing noise from becoming a source of bias. Blocking, when the blocking factor is prognostic, *increases* statistical power by explaining variance, which more than offsets the loss of degrees of freedom, and thus does not increase the Type I error rate. It should be *used*, not avoided, when between-block variability is present.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In GEMMs, because genotype is fixed and cohorts can be composed of littermates, randomization is not needed if all animals are drawn from the same breeding pipeline; allocation concealment is only relevant in human trials. Blinding should focus on outcome assessors to avoid differential measurement error, and blocking can be implemented analytically by including litter or batch as a factor to improve precision.**\nThis option makes dangerous and false claims. The need for randomization is paramount even in isogenic animal models due to numerous unmeasured confounders (e.g., maternal effects, microbiome, cage microenvironment). Selection bias is a risk in any study where a human assigns treatments, so allocation concealment is critical in animal studies. While the statements about blinding and analytical blocking are correct, the initial, fundamentally incorrect statements about randomization and allocation concealment invalidate the option as a whole.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Randomization reduces bias only when sample size $n \\to \\infty$; with small GEMM cohorts (e.g., $n \\approx 8$ per arm), it is preferable to match mice on body weight without randomization. Allocation concealment is irrelevant in animal studies because mice cannot influence assignment. Blinding can increase bias if the blocking factor is correlated with treatment, so blocking should be avoided when block effects are strong.**\nThis option demonstrates a misunderstanding of all principles. Randomization ensures the *procedure* is unbiased for any sample size $n$. Matching without subsequent randomization is poor practice. Allocation concealment protects against experimenter bias, not mouse influence. Blocking should be used precisely when the block effect is strong, as this is when the greatest variance reduction is achieved. The statement that blocking can increase bias is confused; in a proper blocked randomized design, it does not.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5007265"}, {"introduction": "With a well-designed experiment underway, the next critical task is the accurate collection and interpretation of phenotypic data.

We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the volume of an ellipsoid with semi-axes $(a,b,c)$ starting from the volume of a sphere. A sphere of radius $r$ is described by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\le r^2$, and its volume is $V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\nAn ellipsoid with semi-axes $a$, $b$, and $c$ is described by the equation $\\frac{x'^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y'^2}{b^2} + \\frac{z'^2}{c^2} \\le 1$.\nWe can obtain this ellipsoid by applying an anisotropic linear scaling to a unit sphere (a sphere with radius $r=1$).

The caliper measurements for the longest axis ($L$), orthogonal width ($W$), and orthogonal height ($H$) correspond to the full lengths of the three principal axes of this ellipsoid.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the semi-axes $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the ellipsoid are half of the measured lengths:\n$a = \\frac{L}{2}$, $b = \\frac{W}{2}$, and $c = \\frac{H}{2}$.\nSubstituting these into the ellipsoid volume formula gives the caliper-based volume estimator:\n$$\nV = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{W}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{H}{2}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{LWH}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} LWH\n$$\nThis formula, $V = \\frac{\\pi}{6}LWH$, is the justified estimator for tumor volume.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the given data. The time points are $t_0 = 14\\,\\text{days}$ and $t_1 = 21\\,\\text{days}$. The time interval is $\\Delta t = t_1 - t_0 = 7\\,\\text{days}$.\nAt $t_0 = 14\\,\\text{days}$, the measurements are $L_0 = 8.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $W_0 = 7.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $H_0 = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The initial volume $V_0$ is:\n$$\nV_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} L_0 W_0 H_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} (8.2)(7.1)(5.0) = \\frac{\\pi}{6} (291.1)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3\n$$\nAt $t_1 = 21\\,\\text{days}$, the measurements are $L_1 = 11.3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $W_1 = 9.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $H_1 = 6.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The final volume $V_1$ is:\n$$\nV_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} L_1 W_1 H_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} (11.3)(9.2)(6.6) = \\frac{\\pi}{6} (686.256)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3\n$$\n\nWe assume unconstrained exponential growth, described by the model $V(t) = V_0 \\exp(k(t-t_0))$, where $k$ is the constant growth rate.\nUsing the two data points:\n$$\nV_1 = V_0 \\exp(k(t_1 - t_0)) = V_0 \\exp(k \\Delta t)\n$$\nWe can solve for the growth constant $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{V_1}{V_0} = \\exp(k \\Delta t) \\implies k = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_0}\\right)\n$$\nThe volume doubling time, $T_d$, is the time required for the volume to double. We set $V(t_0+T_d) = 2V_0$:\n$$\n2V_0 = V_0 \\exp(k T_d) \\implies 2 = \\exp(k T_d) \\implies \\ln(2) = k T_d\n$$\nSolving for $T_d$ and substituting the expression for $k$:\n$$\nT_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_0}\\right)} = \\Delta t \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_0}\\right)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for the volumes and $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\frac{V_1}{V_0} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{6} (686.256)}{\\frac{\\pi}{6} (291.1)} = \\frac{686.256}{291.1}\n$$\nPlugging this into the expression for $T_d$:\n$$\nT_d = 7 \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{686.256}{291.1}\\right)}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\nT_d \\approx 7 \\frac{0.693147}{0.857640} \\approx 7 \\times 0.80816 \\approx 5.65712\\,\\text{days}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the volume doubling time is $5.66\\,\\text{days}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.66}$$", "id": "5007283"}]}
