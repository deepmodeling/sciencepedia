Construct a program that, for each provided test case, computes a net ethical score and a final acceptability decision under the following strictly specified definitions, using no domain-specific shortcuts beyond these bases.\n\nDefinitions (all symbols and numbers must be treated as mathematical entities):\n- Replacement, Reduction, Refinement (3Rs): These modify harm inputs as follows.\n- Let the baseline per-animal severity be $s \\in [0,1]$.\n- Let the refinement fraction be $r \\in [0,1]$ and define the refined severity as $s' = s \\cdot (1 - r)$.\n- Let the initial number of animals be $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and the reduction fraction be $q \\in [0,1)$.\n- Let the fraction of endpoints replaceable by non-animal alternatives be $a \\in [0,1]$; this further reduces the number of animals used.\n- Define the adjusted number of animals as the integer $n' = \\left\\lceil n \\cdot (1 - q) \\cdot (1 - a) \\right\\rceil$, where $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$ is the ceiling function.\n- Let the normalized duration factor be $d \\in (0,1]$, and let the harm–duration nonlinearity exponent be $\\alpha \\ge 1$. The total harm is $H = n' \\cdot s' \\cdot d^{\\alpha}$.\n- Let the expected utility magnitude of a successful translation be $U  0$ (in arbitrary, unitless utility units).\n- Let $p_i \\in [0,1]$ denote the probability of internal validity (e.g., reproducibility), $p_e \\in [0,1]$ the probability of external validity (human relevance), and $p_b \\in [0,1]$ the prior probability of biological plausibility.

This framework is constructed from first principles of decision theory, specifically expected utility, combined with the ethical principles of Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement (the $3$Rs). The task is to implement this framework as a computational model to evaluate a set of hypothetical research proposals.\n\nThe model calculates a net ethical score, $E$, and determines the ethical acceptability of a study based on a series of predefined constraints. The logic proceeds by first quantifying the total harm and the expected benefit, then combining them into the net score, and finally applying the decision rules.\n\nThe calculation is structured as follows:\n\n**Harm Calculation**\nThe total harm, $H$, is a composite measure reflecting the number of animals used, the severity of procedures per animal, and the duration of the study.\n\n1.  **Refined Severity ($s'$)**: The baseline per-animal severity, $s \\in [0,1]$, is mitigated by refinement efforts. The refinement fraction, $r \\in [0,1]$, quantifies the proportional reduction in severity. The resulting refined severity, $s'$, is given by:\n    $$s' = s \\cdot (1 - r)$$\n\n2.  **Adjusted Number of Animals ($n'$)**: The initial cohort size, $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, is decreased by two factors. The reduction fraction, $q \\in [0,1)$, represents a direct decrease in animal numbers through improved experimental design. The replacement fraction, $a \\in [0,1]$, represents the proportion of endpoints that can be assessed using non-animal methods, further decreasing the required number of animals. The final adjusted number of animals, $n'$, is the smallest integer not less than the reduced value:\n    $$n' = \\left\\lceil n \\cdot (1 - q) \\cdot (1 - a) \\right\\rceil$$\n    where $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$ denotes the ceiling function.\n\n3.  **Total Harm ($H$)**: The total harm is calculated by aggregating the refined severity over the adjusted number of animals, modulated by the study's duration. The normalized duration factor is $d \\in (0,1]$, and its effect on harm is made nonlinear by the exponent $\\alpha \\ge 1$. The total harm, $H$, is thus:\n    $$H = n' \\cdot s' \\cdot d^{\\alpha}$$\n\n**Benefit Calculation**\nThe expected benefit, $B$, is the potential utility of a successful research outcome, discounted by its probability of success.\n\n1.  **Translational Success Probability ($p_t$)**: The probability of a study yielding a translatable, beneficial outcome is modeled as the product of three independent probabilities: the probability of internal validity, $p_i \\in [0,1]$; the probability of external validity (relevance to humans), $p_e \\in [0,1]$; and the prior probability of biological plausibility, $p_b \\in [0,1]$. Thus, the translational success probability, $p_t$, is:\n    $$p_t = p_i \\cdot p_e \\cdot p_b$$\n\n2.  **Expected Benefit ($B$)**: The expected benefit is the product of the utility magnitude of a successful translation, $U  0$, and the probability of that success, $p_t$.\n    $$B = U \\cdot p_t$$\n\n**Net Ethical Score and Decision Framework**\nThe final decision of acceptability hinges on a net ethical score and a set of absolute constraints.\n\n1.  **Net Ethical Score ($E$)**: The score is calculated using an expected utility framework. It is the expected benefit, $B$, minus the total harm, $H$, which is scaled by a harm-aversion weight, $\\lambda  0$. This weight represents the ethical premium placed on avoiding harm relative to achieving benefit.\n    $$E = B - \\lambda \\cdot H$$\n\n2.  **Ethical Acceptability Conditions**: A study is deemed acceptable only if it satisfies all of the following four conditions simultaneously:\n    - **Replacement Enforcement Rule**: If a significant portion of the study is replaceable ($a \\ge \\rho$, for a given threshold $\\rho \\in [0,1]$) but animals are still being used ($n'  0$), the study is rejected outright. This condition is not triggered if $n' = 0$.\n    - **Severity Cap**: The refined per-animal severity must not exceed a predetermined cap, $s_{\\cap} \\in (0,1]$. This imposes an absolute limit on animal suffering, regardless of potential benefit. The condition is $s' \\le s_{\\cap}$.\n    - **Translational Credibility Threshold**: The probability of translational success, $p_t$, must meet a minimum threshold, $t_{\\min} \\in [0,1]$. This prevents studies with a very low chance of success. The condition is $p_t \\ge t_{\\min}$.\n    - **Net Score Threshold**: The net ethical score, $E$, must be non-negative or exceed a specified threshold, $\\tau \\ge 0$. This ensures the expected benefits justify the weighted harms. The condition is $E \\ge \\tau$.\n\nThe final output for each case is the calculated score $E$ (rounded to $3$ decimal places) and a boolean decision indicating whether all acceptability conditions are met.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes a net ethical score and acceptability decision for animal studies\n    based on a formal harm-benefit analysis framework.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test cases as tuples of parameters:\n    # (n, s, d, r, q, a, U, p_i, p_e, p_b, alpha, lambda, tau, t_min, s_cap, rho)\n    test_cases = [\n        (60, 0.4, 0.5, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1, 100.0, 0.7, 0.5, 0.6, 1.2, 2.0, 5.0, 0.15, 0.6, 0.5),\n        (30, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0, 120.0, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0, 1.5, 5.0, 0.15, 0.6, 0.5),\n        (20, 0.9, 0.3, 0.1, 0.25, 0.0, 80.0, 0.6, 0.5, 0.5, 1.1, 1.0, 5.0, 0.15, 0.6, 0.5),\n        (50, 0.5, 0.6, 0.3, 0.2, 0.7, 200.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 0.15, 0.6, 0.5),\n        (10, 0.8, 0.7, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 30.0, 0.9, 0.7, 0.6, 1.3, 2.0, 5.0, 0.15, 0.6, 0.5)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack parameters with descriptive names\n        (n, s, d, r, q, a, U, p_i, p_e, p_b, alpha, \n         lambda_harm, tau, t_min, s_cap, rho) = case\n        \n        # --- Harm Calculation ---\n        # 1.

Focusing on Reduction, the team considers two balanced designs with equal allocation between therapy and control: a completely randomized design and a randomized block (paired) design in which each litter constitutes a block that contributes exactly one treated and one control animal.\n\nAssume a standard additive random-effects model for a continuous endpoint (for example, hydroxyproline content) under both designs. Let $Y_{ij}$ denote the endpoint for animal $j \\in \\{\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{C}\\}$ in block $i$, and suppose\n$$\nY_{ij} \\;=\\; \\mu \\;+\\; \\tau_{j} \\;+\\; b_{i} \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_{ij},\n$$\nwhere $b_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_{b}^{2})$ are independent block effects, $\\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_{w}^{2})$ are independent within-block errors, and all random terms are mutually independent.

The solution demonstrates the statistical efficiency gained by blocking. The derivation proceeds as follows:\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio $\\kappa = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{RBD}}}{N_{\\mathrm{CRD}}}$, where $N_{\\mathrm{CRD}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{RBD}}$ are the total number of animals required to achieve the same statistical power ($1-\\beta$) for detecting a treatment effect $\\Delta = \\tau_{\\mathrm{T}} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{C}}$ in a two-sided hypothesis test at significance level $\\alpha$. The variance components $\\sigma_{b}^{2}$ and $\\sigma_{w}^{2}$ are assumed known, and the sample sizes are assumed large enough for a normal approximation (Z-test) to be valid.\n\nFor a two-sided Z-test of a mean or a difference in means, the required sample size depends on the variance of the estimator of the effect, $\\hat{\\Delta}$. Let $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta})$ be the standard error of the estimator. For a given $\\Delta$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$, the condition on $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta})$ is fixed:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\Delta|}{\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}\n$$\nThis implies that the required variance of the estimator is\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) \\le \\frac{\\Delta^2}{(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}\n$$\nFor the minimal sample size, we take the equality. The quantity $C = \\frac{(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2}$ is a constant because $\\Delta$, $\\alpha$, and the power are the same for both designs. We must find how the total sample size $N$ relates to $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})$ in each case.\n\n**1. Completely Randomized Design (CRD)**\n\nIn a CRD, the block structure (litters) is ignored, and animals are randomly assigned to the two groups: therapy (T) and control (C). The total sample size is $N_{\\mathrm{CRD}}$, with $n_{\\mathrm{T}} = n_{\\mathrm{C}} = N_{\\mathrm{CRD}}/2$ animals in each group due to the balanced design.\n\nThe model for an observation $k$ in treatment group $j$ is $Y_{k} = \\mu + \\tau_{j} + \\text{random error}$. The random error term for any animal is a sum of its litter effect $b_i$ and individual error $\\varepsilon_{ij}$. Since animals are randomized without regard to litter, the total variance for a single observation is the sum of the variances of the random components:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathrm{Var}(b_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}) = \\mathrm{Var}(b_i) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{ij}) = \\sigma_{b}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}\n$$\nThe estimator for the treatment effect is the difference in sample means, $\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{CRD}} = \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{T}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C}}$.

Randomized Block Design (RBD)**\n\nIn an RBD with paired observations, each block (litter) $i$ contains one animal assigned to therapy and one to control. Let there be $n_b$ such blocks. The total number of animals is $N_{\\mathrm{RBD}} = 2n_b$.\n\nThe observations for the two animals in block $i$ are:\n$$\nY_{i\\mathrm{T}} = \\mu + \\tau_{\\mathrm{T}} + b_{i} + \\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{T}} \\\\\nY_{i\\mathrm{C}} = \\mu + \\tau_{\\mathrm{C}} + b_{i} + \\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{C}}\n$$\nThe analysis proceeds by calculating the difference $D_i$ for each block:\n$$\nD_i = Y_{i\\mathrm{T}} - Y_{i\\mathrm{C}} = (\\mu + \\tau_{\\mathrm{T}} + b_{i} + \\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{T}}) - (\\mu + \\tau_{\\mathrm{C}} + b_{i} + \\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{C}}) = (\\tau_{\\mathrm{T}} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{C}}) + (\\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{T}} - \\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{C}})\n$$\n$D_i = \\Delta + \\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{T}} - \\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{C}}$. Notably, the random block effect $b_i$ is eliminated. The expected value of the difference is $E[D_i] = \\Delta$. Since the within-block errors $\\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{T}}$ and $\\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{C}}$ are independent, the variance of $D_i$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{T}} - \\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{C}}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{T}}) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{C}}) = \\sigma_{w}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2} = 2\\sigma_{w}^{2}\n$$\nThe estimator for $\\Delta$ is the average of these differences, $\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{RBD}} = \\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{n_b} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_b} D_i$. The differences $D_i$ are independent across blocks.

Derivation of the Ratio $\\kappa$**\n\nSince the required sample size is proportional to the variance of the estimator of the effect, we can write the ratio of sample sizes as the ratio of these variances:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{RBD}}}{N_{\\mathrm{CRD}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{w}^{2}}{\\sigma_{b}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}\n$$\n\n**4.

Define MABEL as the minimal dose predicted, from mechanistic principles and human-relevant potency, to achieve a just-discernible biological effect safely.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using well-tested pharmacokinetic facts for intravenous dosing, compute the monkey average plasma concentration at the NOAEL regimen over one dosing interval by equating the average concentration to the ratio of dose rate to clearance.\n2. Using the given allometric law for clearance, scale the monkey clearance to predict total human clearance and compute the human dose rate that would reproduce the monkey NOAEL average concentration. Convert this to a weekly human dose, and then apply the uncertainty factor $U$ to obtain the NOAEL-derived maximum recommended starting dose.\n3. Using the law of mass action for receptor binding, derive the minimal free drug concentration in plasma required to achieve $RO^{*}$ for a target with $K_{D}$, convert that concentration to $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$ using the molecular weight $M$, and then use the initial peak concentration relationship for an intravenous bolus to compute the human weekly dose that yields that peak concentration, taking $V_{d}$ to scale with $BW$ as given.\n4. Choose the lower of the two human weekly doses from tasks $2$ and $3$ to align with Refinement and Reduction in the Three Rs, and report it as the recommended first-in-human weekly intravenous starting dose.\n\nExpress the final recommended first-in-human weekly dose in $\\text{mg}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The task is to determine the recommended first-in-human (FIH) starting dose by calculating a dose based on the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) and a dose based on the Minimal Anticipated Biological Effect Level (MABEL), and then selecting the more conservative (lower) of the two values.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the NOAEL-Derived Human Dose**\n\nFirst, we calculate the average plasma concentration at steady state ($C_{avg, m}$) in the monkey at the NOAEL dose. For a weekly dosing regimen, the dosing interval is $\\tau = 7$ days. The average concentration is the total dose administered over the interval divided by the total clearance over that same interval, which simplifies to the ratio of the dose rate to the clearance.\n\nThe dose rate per kilogram in monkeys is:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{m,\\text{kg}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{m,\\text{kg}}}{\\tau} = \\frac{1.0 \\text{ mg/kg}}{7 \\text{ days}} $$\n\nThe average concentration in the monkey, $C_{avg, m}$, is then:\n$$ C_{avg, m} = \\frac{\\text{Rate}_{m,\\text{kg}}}{CL_{m,\\text{kg}}} = \\frac{(1.0/7) \\text{ mg/kg/day}}{0.15 \\text{ L/day/kg}} = \\frac{1.0}{7 \\times 0.15} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} = \\frac{1.0}{1.05} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} \\approx 0.9524 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} $$\nThis value represents the target exposure to be matched in humans.\n\nNext, we scale the monkey clearance ($CL_m$) to predict the human clearance ($CL_h$) using the provided allometric scaling law, $CL \\propto BW^{0.75}$.\nFirst, we find the total clearance in a representative monkey:\n$$ CL_m = CL_{m,\\text{kg}} \\times BW_m = (0.15 \\text{ L/day/kg}) \\times (3.5 \\text{ kg}) = 0.525 \\text{ L/day} $$\nNow, we scale this to a human:\n$$ CL_h = CL_m \\left(\\frac{BW_h}{BW_m}\\right)^{0.75} = (0.525 \\text{ L/day}) \\left(\\frac{70 \\text{ kg}}{3.5 \\text{ kg}}\\right)^{0.75} = 0.525 \\times (20)^{0.75} \\text{ L/day} $$\n$$ CL_h \\approx 0.525 \\times 9.4574 \\text{ L/day} \\approx 4.965 \\text{ L/day} $$\n\nTo achieve the same average concentration in humans ($C_{avg, h} = C_{avg, m}$), we calculate the required human dose rate ($\\text{Rate}_h$):\n$$ \\text{Rate}_h = C_{avg, h} \\times CL_h = C_{avg, m} \\times CL_h = \\left(\\frac{1.0}{1.05} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}}\\right) \\times (4.965 \\text{ L/day}) \\approx 4.7287 \\text{ mg/day} $$\nThe total weekly dose for humans, $D_{h,raw}$, is this rate multiplied by the dosing interval $\\tau = 7$ days:\n$$ D_{h,raw} = \\text{Rate}_h \\times \\tau \\approx (4.7287 \\text{ mg/day}) \\times (7 \\text{ days}) \\approx 33.10 \\text{ mg} $$\nFinally, we apply the uncertainty factor $U=10$ to obtain the NOAEL-derived maximum recommended starting dose, $D_{h,NOAEL}$:\n$$ D_{h,NOAEL} = \\frac{D_{h,raw}}{U} = \\frac{33.10 \\text{ mg}}{10} = 3.310 \\text{ mg} $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the MABEL-Derived Human Dose**\n\nThe MABEL approach aims to find the dose that achieves a minimal, yet observable, biological effect. This is calculated based on achieving a target receptor occupancy ($RO^*$). The relationship between free drug concentration $[C]$, the dissociation constant $K_D$, and receptor occupancy $RO$ is given by the law of mass action:\n$$ RO = \\frac{[C]}{[C] + K_D} $$\nWe need to find the concentration $[C]^*$ required to achieve the target occupancy $RO^* = 0.10$.\n$$ RO^* = \\frac{[C]^*}{[C]^* + K_D} \\implies [C]^* = K_D \\frac{RO^*}{1 - RO^*} $$\nSubstituting the given values, $K_D = 0.2 \\text{ nM} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol/L}$ and $RO^* = 0.10$:\n$$ [C]^* = (0.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ M}) \\times \\frac{0.10}{1 - 0.10} = (0.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ M}) \\times \\frac{0.10}{0.90} = \\frac{0.2}{9} \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol/L} $$\n\nNext, we convert this molar concentration to a mass concentration ($C^*_{mg/L}$) using the molecular weight $M = 150{,}000 \\text{ g/mol}$:\n$$ C^*_{mg/L} = [C]^* (\\text{mol/L}) \\times M (\\text{g/mol}) \\times 1000 (\\text{mg/g}) $$\n$$ C^*_{mg/L} = \\left(\\frac{0.2}{9} \\times 10^{-9}\\right) \\times (150{,}000) \\times (1000) = \\frac{0.2 \\times 1.5 \\times 10^5 \\times 10^3}{9} \\times 10^{-9} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} $$\n$$ C^*_{mg/L} = \\frac{0.3 \\times 10^8}{9} \\times 10^{-9} = \\frac{1}{30} \\times 10^{-1} = \\frac{1}{300} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} \\approx 0.00333 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} $$\nThis concentration is the target for the initial peak plasma concentration ($C_{0,h}$) immediately following an intravenous bolus injection.\n\nThe dose required to achieve this peak concentration is calculated using the relationship $C_0 = \\text{Dose} / V_d$, where $V_d$ is the volume of distribution. First, we determine the human volume of distribution, $V_{dh}$. The problem states $V_d$ scales with $BW$, and provides $V_{d,\\text{kg}}$, implying linear scaling.\n$$ V_{dh} = V_{d,\\text{kg}} \\times BW_h = (0.05 \\text{ L/kg}) \\times (70 \\text{ kg}) = 3.5 \\text{ L} $$\nThe MABEL-derived dose, $D_{h,MABEL}$, is then:\n$$ D_{h,MABEL} = C_{0,h} \\times V_{dh} = \\left(\\frac{1}{300} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}}\\right) \\times (3.5 \\text{ L}) = \\frac{3.5}{300} \\text{ mg} = \\frac{7}{600} \\text{ mg} $$\n$$ D_{h,MABEL} \\approx 0.011667 \\text{ mg} $$\n\n**Part 3: Final Dose Selection**\n\nThe final step is to compare the two calculated doses and choose the more conservative (lower) value as the recommended starting dose. This aligns with the principles of risk mitigation.\n$$ D_{h,NOAEL} \\approx 3.310 \\text{ mg} $$\n$$ D_{h,MABEL} \\approx 0.011667 \\text{ mg} $$\nComparing the two values, $D_{h,MABEL}$ is substantially lower than $D_{h,NOAEL}$.\n$$ 0.011667 \\text{ mg}  3.310 \\text{ mg} $$\nTherefore, the MABEL-derived dose is the more conservative choice and is selected as the recommended FIH starting dose.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ D_{recommended} = 0.0117 \\text{ mg} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0117}\n$$", "id": "4990298"}]}
