A closed cohort of $200$ individuals, all confirmed disease-free at baseline, is followed for $6$ months with complete follow-up and no competing risks or losses to follow-up. Over the $6$-month interval, $8$ individuals develop the disease of interest. Using only the foundational definition of cumulative incidence, compute the $6$-month cumulative incidence (CI) for this cohort and interpret it as the probability that a randomly selected member of this baseline disease-free cohort develops the disease within $6$ months under these study conditions. Express your numerical answer for $CI$ as a decimal and round to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.", "solution": "The fundamental base for this problem is the definition of cumulative incidence in a closed cohort with complete follow-up. Cumulative incidence over a fixed time interval is the proportion of initially disease-free individuals who become incident cases during that interval. Formally, for a closed cohort with no censoring or competing risks over the interval, cumulative incidence is\n$$\nCI(t) \\equiv \\Pr(T \\le t) = \\frac{\\text{number of incident cases in }[0,t]}{\\text{number at risk at }t=0}.\n$$\nHere, the cohort is closed, all $200$ individuals are disease-free at baseline, follow-up is complete for $6$ months, and there are $8$ incident cases over $t = 6$ months. Therefore,\n$$\nCI(6\\ \\text{months}) = \\frac{8}{200}.\n$$\nCompute the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{8}{200} = 0.04.\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $0.04000$.\n\nInterpretation as a probability: Under these conditions (closed cohort, complete follow-up, and no competing risks), the $6$-month cumulative incidence $CI(6\\ \\text{months}) = 0.04000$ is the estimated probability that a randomly selected member of this baseline disease-free cohort will develop the disease within $6$ months. This corresponds to the frequentist interpretation that, under exchangeability and homogeneity over the cohort, if we were to repeatedly sample such cohorts under identical conditions, the proportion developing disease by $6$ months would converge to this probability. No assumption about constant hazard is required for this proportion in a closed cohort; the estimate is exact for this cohort over the specified interval given complete follow-up.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.04000}$$", "id": "4992911"}, {"introduction": "Translational medicine is fundamentally about assessing the impact of interventions. This practice moves from measuring risk in a single group to comparing risks between two groups—for instance, one that received a prophylaxis and one that did not.

However, Population A is considerably older than Population B (32% of Pop A is 60+ vs. 16% of Pop B). Since incidence rises with age, this difference in age structure confounds the comparison.\n\nAfter standardization, the rates ($DSR_A = 61.52$ and $DSR_B = 60.88$) are nearly identical.
