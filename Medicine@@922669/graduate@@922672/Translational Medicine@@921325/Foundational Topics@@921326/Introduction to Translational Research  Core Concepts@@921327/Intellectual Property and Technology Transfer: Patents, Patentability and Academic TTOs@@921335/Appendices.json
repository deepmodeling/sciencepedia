The TTO instructs the team to reason from first principles of inventorship under patent law. The governing base is as follows: conception is the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention, such that a person having ordinary skill in the art (PHOSITA) could practice it without undue experimentation; reduction to practice, including experimental validation, execution of instructions, or optimization, does not by itself make one an inventor; inventorship is determined on a claim-by-claim basis and requires that an individual contribute to the conception of the subject matter of that claim; joint inventorship exists when each named inventor contributed in a non-trivial way to the conception of at least one limitation within the claim; a dependent claim includes all limitations of the claim from which it depends; and a method claim that recites use of a composition includes the composition limitations as part of the claimed subject matter.\n\nClaims to be evaluated:\n- Claim $1$: A lipid nanoparticle composition for delivering messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding an antifibrotic protein to lung fibrotic tissue, comprising: (a) an ionizable lipid having a tertiary amine with a $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ between $6.2$ and $6.6$; (b) cholesterol; (c) a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid present at $0.5$–$2$ mol$\\%$; (d) a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) targeting ligand covalently linked to a phospholipid anchor, configured to bind integrin $\\alpha_v\\beta_6$; wherein the nanoparticle hydrodynamic diameter is $60$–$90$ nm; and wherein the composition results in at least a 3-fold higher delivery to lung fibroblasts relative to liver at an equivalent dose in vivo.\n- Claim $2$: The composition of claim $1$, wherein the ionizable lipid comprises a biodegradable ester linker that is hydrolyzable at physiological pH.\n- Claim $3$: The composition of claim $1$ or claim $2$, wherein the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encodes human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).\n- Claim $4$: A method of treating lung fibrosis in a subject, comprising administering the composition of claim $1$ or claim $2$ at a dose of $0.5$–$2.0$ mg/kg once weekly for $4$ weeks.\n\nDocumented contributions and records:\n- Dr. Maya Singh (principal investigator, pulmonary biology): Email dated $2024$-$03$-$12$ outlines the idea to achieve lung targeting by decorating lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with a cyclic RGD peptide that binds integrin $\\alpha_v\\beta_6$, proposes covalent linkage of the peptide to a phospholipid anchor, and specifies a particle size window of $60$–$90$ nm for fibroblast uptake.

The legal context is specific and correctly cited (U.S. patent law under the America Invents Act). The problem is well-posed, providing a clear timeline of events and asking for a direct application of statutory rules.\n\nThe analysis hinges on the application of the novelty and grace period provisions of the America Invents Act (AIA), codified in Title 35 of the United States Code.\n\nThe effective filing date of the patent application is May 20, 2025. The one-year grace period under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b)(1) extends one year prior to this date, beginning on May 20, 2024.\n\n**1. Definition of Prior Art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a)(1)**\n\nUnder this statute, an invention is not patentable if it was \"patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.\"\n- The conference poster (June 15, 2024), the preprint (September 1, 2024), and the third-party communication (December 1, 2024) were all publicly available before the filing date of May 20, 2025. Therefore, all three are *prima facie* prior art under § 102(a)(1). We must now assess if any exceptions apply.\n\n**2. Application of Grace Period Exceptions under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b)(1)**\n\nThis section provides exceptions for disclosures that would otherwise be prior art under § 102(a)(1).\n\n- **Exception § 102(b)(1)(A) (Inventor's Own Disclosures):** A disclosure is not prior art if it was made one year or less before the effective filing date by the inventor or by someone who obtained the subject matter from the inventor.\n    - **Conference Poster (June 15, 2024):** This was an inventor disclosure that occurred *after* the grace period start date of May 20, 2024. Thus, it falls within the one-year grace period. The poster is not prior art against the application due to this exception.\n    - **Preprint (September 1, 2024):** This was also an inventor disclosure that occurred within the grace period. Therefore, the preprint is also not prior art against the application due to this exception. This applies to all subject matter in the preprint, including the optimized ratio first disclosed therein.\n\n- **Exception § 102(b)(1)(B) (\"Shielding\" Provision):** A disclosure is not prior art if \"the subject matter disclosed had, before such disclosure, been publicly disclosed by the inventor...\". This protects the inventor from an intervening disclosure by a third party of the same subject matter that the inventor has already publicly disclosed.\n    - **Third-Party Communication (December 1, 2024):** This communication was published *after* the inventor's poster (June 15, 2024) and preprint (September 1, 2024). The problem states it \"reproduced substantially the same formulation and stability findings\" and did not introduce new matter. Because the subject matter of the third-party communication had already \"been publicly disclosed by the inventor,\" this communication is excluded as prior art under § 102(b)(1)(B).\n\n**Conclusion:** None of the three listed disclosures qualify as prior art against Claims 1 or 2 of the application filed on May 20, 2025.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Both the poster and the preprint are prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) that will bar Claims 1 and 2 because they were publicly accessible before the effective filing date, and the United States does not recognize any grace period for such disclosures.**\nThis statement is factually wrong. It correctly identifies the disclosures as falling under § 102(a)(1) but incorrectly claims the U.S. has no grace period. The AIA explicitly provides a one-year grace period for inventor-originated disclosures in § 102(b)(1)(A).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Neither the poster nor the preprint is prior art against the application under 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A) because they are inventor-authored disclosures within the one-year grace period; for the same subject matter, the December 2024 third-party communication is also excluded under 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(B).**\nThis statement accurately reflects the statutory analysis. The poster and preprint are inventor disclosures within the one-year grace period, so they are excluded as prior art by § 102(b)(1)(A). The subsequent third-party disclosure of the same subject matter is then excluded by the \"shielding\" provision of § 102(b)(1)(B). This analysis is correct for all subject matter disclosed by the inventors, affecting both Claim 1 and Claim 2.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The poster is excluded by the grace period, but the preprint remains prior art because online preprints qualify as “printed publications” and cannot be removed by any exception under 35 U.S.C. 102(b).**\nThis statement incorrectly singles out the preprint. The form of the publication (poster vs. preprint) is irrelevant for the application of the inventor-disclosure exception. Both are inventor-originated disclosures within the grace period, and both are excluded as prior art by § 102(b)(1)(A).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The poster is excluded by the grace period, but the preprint is prior art against Claim 2 because it first publicly disclosed the optimized trehalose to polysorbate 80 ratio that was not present in the poster, thereby barring the narrower claim.**\nThis statement misinterprets the function of the grace period. The grace period is designed to allow inventors to disclose their work, including improvements and optimizations, without creating self-barring prior art. The fact that the preprint disclosed new material for the first time does not nullify the grace period exception for that material. The entire preprint disclosure is excused under § 102(b)(1)(A).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Both the poster and the preprint are excluded by the grace period, but the third-party communication remains prior art for Claims 1 and 2 because it is authored by a different group, irrespective of what it cites.**\nThis statement correctly identifies that the poster and preprint are excluded by the grace period. However, it incorrectly concludes that the third-party communication is prior art. It fails to account for the \"shielding\" provision of § 102(b)(1)(B), which explicitly removes a third-party disclosure as prior art if the inventor had already disclosed the same subject matter.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5024685"}, {"introduction": "A patent's strength is tested when a competitor launches a similar product that attempts to design around the claims.

You will learn to evaluate whether a competitor's substitution is an infringing equivalent and, critically, how the patent's own prosecution history can limit the scope of protection and ultimately decide the case.", "problem": "A university’s Technology Transfer Office (TTO) is advising a startup licensee about potential infringement by a competitor in a translational immunotherapy product. The university owns an issued patent with Claim $1$ directed to a cell-encapsulating hydrogel used to deliver engineered T cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Claim $1$ recites, in relevant part: “A hydrogel composition comprising a crosslinked network formed by free-radical polymerization of acrylate monomers selected from 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), in the presence of an enzymatically degradable peptide crosslinker cleavable by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), wherein the hydrogel exhibits a storage modulus at $1$ Hz between $1.5$ and $2.5$ kPa and sustains IL-2 release for at least $7$ days.” The specification focuses on acrylate chemistry; it does not teach methacrylate-based hydrogels as part of the invention.\n\nThe accused competitor sells an otherwise identical hydrogel for the same clinical use, but replaces HEA and PEGDA with the chemically similar methacrylate analogs 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA), maintaining the same MMP-cleavable peptide crosslinker and photoinitiated free-radical polymerization conditions. Independent lab testing shows the following, under identical conditions to those used to characterize the patentee’s product: storage modulus $G'$ at $1$ Hz of $2.1$ kPa for the accused product versus $2.0$ kPa for the patentee’s product; an effective IL-2 diffusivity of $1.2 \\times 10^{-6}$ cm$^2$/s versus $1.1 \\times 10^{-6}$ cm$^2$/s; cumulative IL-2 release of $80\\%$ at day $7$ versus $79\\%$; and engineered T cell viability at day $3$ of $90\\%$ versus $89\\%$.\n\nDuring prosecution at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the examiner cited Jones et al. ($2013$) disclosing HEMA/PEGDMA hydrogels for cytokine delivery (without MMP-cleavable peptide crosslinkers). In response to a rejection for obviousness, the applicant amended the independent claims by (i) deleting “methacrylate” from an originally broader monomer listing (“acrylate or methacrylate”) so that the claims recited “acrylate” only, and (ii) adding the MMP-cleavable peptide crosslinker limitation and the $1.5$–$2.5$ kPa modulus range. In the accompanying remarks, the applicant argued that acrylate-based networks exhibit distinct hydrolytic behavior from the methacrylate networks of Jones and emphasized that Jones did not teach the combination with an MMP-cleavable peptide crosslinker or the claimed mechanical window.\n\nAssume United States law applies. Starting from the core legal definitions of literal infringement (every claim element met) and the doctrine of equivalents (DOE) using the function-way-result framework, and recognizing the limiting doctrines of the all-elements rule and prosecution history estoppel (including the presumption arising from a narrowing amendment made for patentability and its recognized exceptions), which of the following is the most accurate conclusion regarding infringement by the competitor?\n\nA. The competitor infringes under the doctrine of equivalents because the function-way-result test is satisfied, and the prosecution history does not bar recourse to equivalents since the amendments were unrelated to monomer class.\n\nB. The competitor does not infringe because the function-way-result test fails: acrylates and methacrylates polymerize in fundamentally different ways, so the “way” prong is not met.\n\nC. The competitor does not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because a narrowing amendment deleted “methacrylate” to secure allowance, creating a presumption of prosecution history estoppel that is not overcome by any exception; the function-way-result similarity cannot overcome estoppel.\n\nD. The competitor literally infringes because HEMA and PEGDMA are sufficiently close to HEA and PEGDA and the claim’s open transition “comprising” permits substitution.\n\nE. The competitor does not infringe because any doctrine-of-equivalents scope broad enough to cover methacrylates would ensnare the Jones prior art regardless of the MMP-cleavable peptide crosslinker, so the doctrine of equivalents is unavailable on ensnarement grounds.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed, and scientifically grounded hypothetical based on United States patent law as applied to a realistic scenario in biomaterials and translational medicine. The problem provides all necessary factual predicates to conduct a standard infringement analysis, including the claim language, the accused product's composition and properties, the relevant prior art, and the prosecution history. The legal doctrines to be applied are explicitly stated. The problem is internally consistent and objective.\n\nThe analysis of infringement proceeds in two steps as a matter of law: first, an assessment of literal infringement, and second, if there is no literal infringement, an assessment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.\n\n**1. Literal Infringement Analysis**\n\nLiteral infringement occurs when every limitation recited in a patent claim is present in the accused device or method. The claim at issue, Claim 1, recites, in part, \"A hydrogel composition comprising a crosslinked network formed by free-radical polymerization of **acrylate monomers** selected from 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA)...\"\n\nThe accused competitor's product is described as using \"2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA)\". From a chemical standpoint, acrylate and methacrylate are distinct classes of compounds. An acrylate moiety has the structure R-O-C(=O)-CH=CH₂, whereas a methacrylate has the structure R-O-C(=O)-C(CH₃)=CH₂. The presence of the alpha-methyl group in methacrylates distinguishes them chemically and structurally from acrylates.\n\nBecause the competitor's product uses methacrylate monomers, it does not contain the \"acrylate monomers\" as recited in Claim 1. Therefore, an essential limitation of the claim is not met, and there can be no literal infringement.\n\n**2. Doctrine of Equivalents (DOE) Analysis**\n\nIn the absence of literal infringement, infringement can still be found under the doctrine of equivalents (DOE) if a substitute element in the accused product performs substantially the same function, in substantially the same way, to achieve substantially the same result as the claimed element. This is known as the function-way-result (FWR) test.\n\n*   **Function**: The function of the monomers is to polymerize via free-radical chemistry to form a hydrogel network for cell and cytokine delivery. Both the claimed acrylates and the accused methacrylates perform this same function. The Function prong is met.\n*   **Way**: The \"way\" is the mechanism of polymerization. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerize through free-radical chain reactions under photoinitiation, as stated in the problem. While subtle kinetic and chemical differences exist, the fundamental mechanism is the same for the purpose of forming the hydrogel. The Way prong is likely met.\n*   **Result**: The result is a hydrogel with specific mechanical and release properties. The provided data show that the competitor product's properties are nearly identical to the patentee's: storage modulus $G'$ of 2.1 kPa vs. 2.0 kPa (both within the claimed 1.5–2.5 kPa range), cumulative IL-2 release of 80% vs. 79% at day 7, and T cell viability of 90% vs. 89%. These results are insubstantially different. The Result prong is met.\n\nBased on the FWR test alone, a finding of equivalence would be likely. However, the DOE is limited by several legal doctrines, most critically here by prosecution history estoppel.\n\n**3. Prosecution History Estoppel (PHE) Analysis**\n\nProsecution history estoppel prevents a patentee from reclaiming through DOE subject matter that was surrendered during the patent's prosecution to secure allowance. A surrender is presumed when a patentee narrows a claim to overcome a prior art rejection.\n\nThe facts state that the original claim included \"acrylate or methacrylate\" monomers. In response to an obviousness rejection over the Jones et al. prior art, which disclosed HEMA/PEGDMA (methacrylates), the applicant amended the claim by deleting \"methacrylate.\" This is a quintessential narrowing amendment made for a reason of patentability.\n\nThis action creates a legal presumption that the patentee surrendered the entire scope of subject matter between the original broader claim and the amended narrower claim—namely, all hydrogels made from methacrylate monomers.\n\nThis presumption of estoppel can be rebutted only if the patentee demonstrates one of three exceptions established by the Supreme Court in *Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.*:\n1.  The equivalent was **unforeseeable** at the time of the amendment. Here, methacrylates were not only foreseeable, they were the very subject of the prior art that prompted the amendment. This exception fails.\n2.  The rationale for the amendment was only **tangentially related** to the equivalent. The rationale was to distinguish the invention from the methacrylate-based prior art. The amendment was therefore directly related to the equivalent. This exception fails.\n3.  There is **some other reason** the patentee could not have been reasonably expected to claim the equivalent. There is no such reason provided. The applicant could have attempted to draft claims that distinguished their use of methacrylates from the prior art, but instead chose to disclaim them entirely. This exception fails.\n\nSince none of the exceptions apply, the presumption of estoppel holds. The patentee is legally barred (\"estopped\") from asserting that the competitor's methacrylates are equivalent to the claimed acrylates. This legal bar is conclusive and overrides the FWR analysis.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The competitor infringes under the doctrine of equivalents because the function-way-result test is satisfied, and the prosecution history does not bar recourse to equivalents since the amendments were unrelated to monomer class.**\n**Incorrect.** The second clause is factually wrong. The amendment was the explicit deletion of \"methacrylate\" to overcome a \"methacrylate\" prior art reference. The amendment was directly and undeniably related to the monomer class. This surrender of subject matter creates prosecution history estoppel.\n\n**B. The competitor does not infringe because the function-way-result test fails: acrylates and methacrylates polymerize in fundamentally different ways, so the “way” prong is not met.**\n**Incorrect.** While there are differences between acrylate and methacrylate polymerization, their fundamental mechanism (free-radical chain growth) is the same. It is debatable whether this constitutes a failure of the \"way\" prong, which is often interpreted broadly. More importantly, this is not the most accurate or dispositive reason for non-infringement. The definitive legal reason is prosecution history estoppel, which applies even if the FWR test is fully satisfied.\n\n**C. The competitor does not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because a narrowing amendment deleted “methacrylate” to secure allowance, creating a presumption of prosecution history estoppel that is not overcome by any exception; the function-way-result similarity cannot overcome estoppel.**\n**Correct.** This option accurately describes the core legal issue. A narrowing amendment (deleting \"methacrylate\") for patentability reasons (overcoming Jones) creates a presumption of estoppel. As analyzed above, the exceptions to estoppel do not apply. Prosecution history estoppel is a legal bar that is not overcome by a finding of equivalence under the FWR test. This is the most precise and complete legal conclusion.\n\n**D. The competitor literally infringes because HEMA and PEGDMA are sufficiently close to HEA and PEGDA and the claim’s open transition “comprising” permits substitution.**\n**Incorrect.** This option misapplies two fundamental concepts. First, literal infringement requires an exact match, not \"sufficiently close,\" which is the standard for equivalence. Acrylates and methacrylates are not chemically identical. Second, the transitional phrase \"comprising\" means the claimed composition must contain the listed elements but may also contain additional, unlisted elements. It does not permit the substitution of a required element (acrylate) with a different one (methacrylate).\n\n**E. The competitor does not infringe because any doctrine-of-equivalents scope broad enough to cover methacrylates would ensnare the Jones prior art regardless of the MMP-cleavable peptide crosslinker, so the doctrine of equivalents is unavailable on ensnarement grounds.**\n**Incorrect.** This option invokes the ensnarement doctrine, which prevents DOE from expanding a claim to cover the prior art. A hypothetical claim covering the competitor's product would include the HEMA/PEGDMA monomers, the MMP-cleavable peptide, and the specific modulus range. The Jones prior art taught HEMA/PEGDMA but lacked the MMP-cleavable peptide and the specific modulus range. The applicant successfully argued during prosecution that this combination was non-obvious. Therefore, it is not certain, and perhaps unlikely, that this hypothetical claim would be unpatentable over (i.e., \"ensnare\") the Jones prior art. The prosecution history estoppel argument is direct, fact-based, and far more definitive than the speculative ensnarement argument. Thus, this is not the most accurate reason for non-infringement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5024714"}]}
