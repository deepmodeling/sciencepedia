They should be aligned with risk-inflection points.\n\n- **Gate 1: Preclinical Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Gate.**\n  - **Placement:** After Task E (Preclinical efficacy study), at week $15$.\n  - **Justification:** Task E represents the first major test of the therapeutic hypothesis: Does the agent show efficacy in a validated preclinical model? The outcome is a major determinant of project value and viability. This gate allows the partnership to review the efficacy data before committing to the costly and lengthy GLP toxicology study (Task G, $10$ weeks) and final IND-enabling activities. The fact that Task E is on the critical path underscores its importance as a key milestone.\n\n- **Gate 2: Candidate Nomination / Pre-IND Gate.**\n  - **Placement:** After Task G (GLP toxicology) and Task H (Regulatory alignment), at week $25$.\n  - **Justification:** This gate marks the culmination of all major preclinical development activities. By week $25$, the critical GLP toxicology data from Task G is available, representing the primary safety assessment for first-in-human studies. Furthermore, parallel sub-critical paths for regulatory strategy (Task H) and CMC development (Task F) have yielded their primary outputs. This gate serves as the decision point to formally nominate the drug as a clinical candidate. The team evaluates the integrated data package—efficacy (E), safety (G), manufacturability (F), and regulatory path (H)—to decide whether to make the substantial investment in filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application (Task I) and initiating clinical trial startup activities (Task J). Task G lies on the critical path, making its completion a natural trigger for this major project review.\n\n- **Gate 3: First-in-Human (FIH) Dosing Readiness Gate.**\n  - **Placement:** After Task J (Clinical site contracting and IRB approvals), at week $34$.\n  - **Justification:** This represents the final checkpoint before the irreversible step of dosing a human subject. By this point, the IND has been assembled (Task I), implicitly submitted and cleared by regulators, and the clinical infrastructure is in place (Task J). This gate is a final operational and safety review to ensure all regulatory, ethical, and logistical prerequisites for starting the clinical trial (Task K) have been met. It confirms that the project is ready to transition from a preclinical asset to a clinical one. Both Tasks I and J are on the critical path, leading directly to the initiation of the clinical phase.\n\nThe total project duration is the earliest finish time of the final task, L, which is $38$ weeks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{38}$$", "id": "5000772"}, {"introduction": "Before partners commit to a collaboration, they must have a shared understanding of the potential financial value of the asset they are co-developing.

Given the parameters $R_0 = 120$ and $\\beta = 2$, $R(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $r$ for $r \\geq 0$. Therefore, the total value is maximized at the lowest possible royalty rate, $r=0$.\n\nIn an unconstrained scenario (i.e., no limit on $F$), the parties would first agree to set $r=0$ to maximize the total surplus, and then use $F$ to divide this surplus according to their bargaining weights. The standard Nash solution splits the net surplus $S_{net}(r) = (u_A+u_B) - (d_A+d_B) = R(r) - (c_A+C_B+d_A+d_B)$ such that $u_A - d_A = \\alpha S_{net}(r)$ and $u_B - d_B = (1-\\alpha) S_{net}(r)$.\n\nLet's calculate the unconstrained $F$ for $r=0$.\nAt $r=0$, $R(0) = R_0 = 120$.\n$u_A(0,F) - d_A = F + 0 - c_A - d_A = F - 10 - 5 = F - 15$.\n$S_{net}(0) = R(0) - (c_A+C_B+d_A+d_B) = 120 - (10+40+5+0) = 120-55 = 65$.\nThe condition $u_A - d_A = \\alpha S_{net}(0)$ becomes:\n$F - 15 = 0.6 \\times 65 = 39$\n$F = 39 + 15 = 54$.\nThis unconstrained upfront payment is $F=54$. However, the problem states a cash constraint $F \\leq \\bar{F}$, with $\\bar{F}=30$. Since $54 > 30$, the unconstrained solution is not feasible. The constraint on $F$ must be a binding constraint at the solution. Therefore, we must have $F^{\\star} = \\bar{F} = 30$.\n\nWith $F^{\\star}=30$ fixed, the problem reduces to finding the optimal royalty rate $r^{\\star}$ that maximizes the Nash product. We now have a single-variable optimization problem:\nMaximize $\\mathcal{N}(r) = (u_A(r, 30) - d_A)^{\\alpha} (u_B(r, 30) - d_B)^{1-\\alpha}$ over $0 \\leq r \\leq 1$.\nIt is equivalent to maximizing the logarithm of the Nash product, $G(r) = \\ln(\\mathcal{N}(r))$.\nLet's substitute the parameter values into the net utility expressions:\n$u_A(r, 30) - d_A = 30 + r \\cdot 120\\exp(-2r) - 10 - 5 = 15 + 120r\\exp(-2r)$\n$u_B(r, 30) - d_B = (1-r) \\cdot 120\\exp(-2r) - 30 - 40 - 0 = 120(1-r)\\exp(-2r) - 70$\nThe problem is to maximize:\n$$G(r) = 0.6 \\ln(15 + 120r\\exp(-2r)) + 0.4 \\ln(120(1-r)\\exp(-2r) - 70)$$\nWe must ensure the arguments of the logarithms are positive. $15 + 120r\\exp(-2r) > 0$ is always true for $r \\geq 0$. The second condition, $120(1-r)\\exp(-2r) - 70 > 0$, defines an upper bound on $r$. Let $r_{max}$ be the value where $120(1-r_{max})\\exp(-2r_{max}) = 70$. A numerical evaluation shows $r_{max} \\approx 0.1755$. The feasible range is $r \\in [0, r_{max}]$.\n\nTo find the maximum, we compute the derivative $G'(r)$ and set it to zero.\n$$G'(r) = 0.6 \\frac{120\\exp(-2r)(1-2r)}{15 + 120r\\exp(-2r)} + 0.4 \\frac{120\\exp(-2r)(2r-3)}{120(1-r)\\exp(-2r) - 70} = 0$$\nDividing by the common factor $120\\exp(-2r)$ in the numerators, we get:\n$$\\frac{0.6(1-2r)}{15 + 120r\\exp(-2r)} + \\frac{0.4(2r-3)}{120(1-r)\\exp(-2r) - 70} = 0$$\nLet $f(r)$ be the left-hand side of this equation scaled by a convenient factor. At $r=0$, $G'(0) = 0.6(\\frac{120}{15}) + 0.4(\\frac{-360}{50}) = 4.8 - 2.88 = 1.92 > 0$. This indicates the function is increasing at $r=0$, so the maximum is not at $r=0$. As $r \\to r_{max}$, the second term's denominator approaches $0$ from the positive side, while its numerator is negative, so the second term approaches $-\\infty$. Thus $G'(r) \\to -\\infty$ as $r \\to r_{max}$. Since $G'(r)$ is continuous on $[0, r_{max})$ and changes sign from positive to negative, there must be a unique root $r^{\\star} \\in (0, r_{max})$ where $G'(r^{\\star})=0$, which corresponds to the maximum of $G(r)$.\n\nThe equation for $r^{\\star}$ is transcendental and must be solved numerically.\n$$\\frac{0.6(1-2r)}{15 + 120r\\exp(-2r)} = \\frac{0.4(3-2r)}{120(1-r)\\exp(-2r) - 70}$$\nNumerical computation shows that the root is $r^{\\star} \\approx 0.032022$.\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $r^{\\star} \\approx 0.0320$.\nThe upfront payment is fixed by the binding constraint: $F^{\\star} = 30$. Rounding to three significant figures gives $F^{\\star} = 30.0$.\n\nThe negotiation outcome is thus $(r^{\\star}, F^{\\star}) = (0.0320, 30.0)$.\nThe effort-response function $R(r)$ and the cash constraint $F \\leq \\bar{F}$ jointly determine this outcome. The function $R(r)=R_0\\exp(-\\beta r)$ implies that the total value created by the collaboration is maximized at $r=0$. Without the cash constraint, the parties would choose $r=0$ and use a large upfront payment ($F=54$) to divide the spoils appropriately. However, the company's inability to pay more than $F=\\bar{F}=30$ upfront makes this solution infeasible. To compensate the academic center for the lower upfront payment, the royalty rate $r$ must be increased from zero. This creates a trade-off: a higher $r$ benefits the academic center's share of revenue, but it shrinks the total size of that revenue due to the disincentive effect on the company. The Nash bargaining solution $r^{\\star} \\approx 0.0320$ represents the optimal point in this trade-off, balancing the distribution of value against the maximization of total value under the given financial constraint.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0320  30.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5000431"}]}
