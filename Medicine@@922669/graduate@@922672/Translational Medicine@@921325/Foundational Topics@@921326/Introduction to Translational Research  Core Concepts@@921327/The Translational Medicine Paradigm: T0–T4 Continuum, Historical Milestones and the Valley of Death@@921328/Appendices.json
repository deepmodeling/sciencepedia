It presents a standard biostatistical task based on fundamental principles of probability theory as applied to diagnostic test evaluation, a core concept in translational medicine. All required parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly stated.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $M$: The event that a patient has the somatic driver mutation.\n- $M^c$: The event that a patient does not have the mutation. This is the complement of $M$.\n- $T^+$: The event that the companion diagnostic test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the companion diagnostic test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following quantities, which we can express in terms of conditional probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of the mutation, $p$, is the prior probability that a randomly selected patient from the intended population has the mutation.\n    $$P(M) = p$$\n    Consequently, the probability that a patient does not have the mutation is:\n    $$P(M^c) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - p$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the assay, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the mutation.\n    $$Se = P(T^+ | M)$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the assay, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the mutation.\n    $$Sp = P(T^- | M^c)$$\n    From this definition, we can determine the probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient does not have the mutation. This is the complement of specificity.\n    $$P(T^+ | M^c) = 1 - P(T^- | M^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the positive predictive value (PPV). The PPV is defined as the posterior probability that the mutation is truly present, given that the test result is positive.\n$$PPV = P(M | T^+)$$\n\nTo derive an expression for $P(M | T^+)$, we apply Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(M | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | M) P(M)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator contains terms that are already defined: $P(T^+ | M) = Se$ and $P(M) = p$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of obtaining a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, by summing over the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur:\n1.  A true positive: the patient has the mutation and tests positive. The probability of this joint event is $P(T^+ \\cap M)$.\n2.  A false positive: the patient does not have the mutation but tests positive. The probability of this joint event is $P(T^+ \\cap M^c)$.\n\nSo, $P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap M) + P(T^+ \\cap M^c)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can rewrite these terms:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | M) P(M) + P(T^+ | M^c) P(M^c)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given definitions ($p$, $Se$, $Sp$) into this expression:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for the denominator back into Bayes' theorem, we arrive at the analytic expression for the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | M) P(M)}{P(T^+ | M) P(M) + P(T^+ | M^c) P(M^c)} = \\frac{(Se)(p)}{(Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThis is the required general formula for the positive predictive value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given numerical values:\n- Sensitivity, $Se = 0.9$\n- Specificity, $Sp = 0.95$\n- Prevalence, $p = 0.2$\n\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.9)(0.2)}{(0.9)(0.2) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.2)}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the individual components of the expression:\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$(Se)(p) = (0.9)(0.2) = 0.18$$\n\nThe denominator consists of two terms. The first is the probability of a true positive, which we just calculated as $0.18$. The second is the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n$$(1 - Sp)(1 - p) = (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.2) = (0.05)(0.8) = 0.04$$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.18}{0.22} = \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{9}{11}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{9}{11} \\approx 0.818181...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we examine the fifth significant figure.

Compute the NPV by summing the discounted expected cash flows.\n\n**Step 1: Cumulative Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of reaching a given stage is the product of all preceding transition probabilities.\n- The program starts at $T0$, so the probability of incurring the initial cost is $p_0 = 1$.\n- The probability of advancing from $T0$ to $T1$ is $s_1 = 0.5$. This is the cumulative probability of reaching stage $T1$. Let's call this $P(T1)$.\n$$P(T1) = s_1 = 0.5$$\n- The probability of advancing from $T1$ to $T2$ is $s_2 = 0.4$.
