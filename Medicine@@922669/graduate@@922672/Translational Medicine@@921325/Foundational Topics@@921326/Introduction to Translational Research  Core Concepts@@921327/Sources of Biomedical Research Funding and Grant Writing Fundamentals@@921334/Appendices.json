The distinction between direct and indirect (F&A) costs, and the categorization of direct costs into fixed (start-up, DSMB) and variable (per-participant) components, are standard and fundamental concepts in research administration.

It contains no inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total direct cost for a clinical trial. According to the foundational definitions provided, the total direct cost, which we denote as $C_{total}$, is the sum of the total fixed costs and the total variable costs.\n\nLet $C_{fixed}$ represent the total fixed costs and $C_{variable}$ represent the total variable costs. The governing equation is:\n$$C_{total} = C_{fixed} + C_{variable}$$\n\nThe fixed costs are those that are incurred regardless of the number of participants, $n$. From the problem statement, there are two components of fixed cost: the start-up activities cost, $C_{startup}$, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversight cost, $C_{DSMB}$.\n$$C_{fixed} = C_{startup} + C_{DSMB}$$\n\nThe variable costs are those that scale with the number of enrolled participants, $n$. The problem defines a single variable cost component: the clinical operations cost per participant, $c_{participant}$. The total variable cost is the product of the per-participant cost and the total number of participants.\n$$C_{variable} = n \\times c_{participant}$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for $C_{fixed}$ and $C_{variable}$ into the main equation for $C_{total}$, we obtain the complete formula for the total direct cost:\n$$C_{total} = (C_{startup} + C_{DSMB}) + (n \\times c_{participant})$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Number of participants, $n = 120$.\n- Cost per participant, $c_{participant} = \\$3{,}500$.\n- Start-up cost, $C_{startup} = \\$150{,}000$.\n- DSMB cost, $C_{DSMB} = \\$50{,}000$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total fixed cost, $C_{fixed}$:\n$$C_{fixed} = \\$150{,}000 + \\$50{,}000 = \\$200{,}000$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total variable cost, $C_{variable}$:\n$$C_{variable} = 120 \\times \\$3{,}500 = \\$420{,}000$$\n\nFinally, we sum the total fixed and total variable costs to determine the total direct cost, $C_{total}$:\n$$C_{total} = \\$200{,}000 + \\$420{,}000 = \\$620{,}000$$\n\nThe total direct trial cost is $\\$620{,}000$.

The entire process is grounded in the statistical theory of hypothesis testing for the difference between two independent means.\n\nFirst, we establish the statistical framework. Let $n$ be the sample size per arm. The two arms are independent, with sample means $\\bar{X}_1$ and $\\bar{X}_2$, drawn from populations with means $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, and a common known standard deviation $\\sigma$. The primary endpoint is a continuous variable. The hypotheses to be tested are the null hypothesis $H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$ against the two-sided alternative $H_A: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe test statistic is based on the difference in sample means, $\\bar{D} = \\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$. By the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of $\\bar{D}$ is approximately normal.\nUnder $H_0$, the expected value of the difference is $E[\\bar{D}] = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$. The variance of the difference is $\\text{Var}(\\bar{D}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_2)$ due to the independence of the arms. Since $\\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_i) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$, the variance is $\\text{Var}(\\bar{D}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}$. The standard error of the difference is $SE(\\bar{D}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$.\n\nFor a two-sided test with a type I error rate of $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if the absolute value of the standardized test statistic $|Z| = \\frac{|\\bar{D}|}{SE(\\bar{D})}$ exceeds the critical value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$. This corresponds to a rejection region for the unstandardized difference of $|\\bar{D}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$.\n\nPower, denoted as $1-\\beta$, is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true. We calculate power for a specific alternative, namely that the true difference is $|\\mu_1 - \\mu_2| = \\delta$, where $\\delta > 0$. Under this alternative, the sampling distribution of $\\bar{D}$ is $N(\\delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$. The power is the probability that $\\bar{D}$ falls in the rejection region, given this alternative distribution.\n$1-\\beta = P(\\text{reject } H_0 | |\\mu_1 - \\mu_2| = \\delta)$\nFor $\\delta > 0$, the probability of observing $\\bar{D} < -z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$ is negligible for a reasonably powered study.

Calculation of Achieved Power for $n_0 = 35$\nWe are given $n_0 = 35$, $\\alpha = 0.05$, $\\Delta = 0.27$, and $\\sigma^2 = 0.81$.\nFrom $\\sigma^2 = 0.81$, the standard deviation is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{0.81} = 0.9$.\nFor $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value is $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\nWe compute the term $\\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{0.27\\sqrt{35}}{0.9\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{0.3\\sqrt{35}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{0.3 \\times 5.916}{1.414} \\approx 1.255\n$$\nNow we evaluate the arguments of the $\\Phi$ function:\n$$\nz_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n_0}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 1.96 - 1.255 = 0.705\n$$\n$$\n-z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n_0}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} \\approx -1.96 - 1.255 = -3.215\n$$\nThe power is:\n$$\n\\text{Power} \\approx (1 - \\Phi(0.705)) + \\Phi(-3.215)\n$$\nFrom standard normal tables or a calculator, $\\Phi(0.705) \\approx 0.7596$ and $\\Phi(-3.215) \\approx 0.00065$.\n$$\n\\text{Power} \\approx (1 - 0.7596) + 0.00065 = 0.2404 + 0.00065 = 0.24105\n$$\nThe achieved power is approximately $0.241$, or $24.1\\%$, which confirms the assessment that the study is underpowered.\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Minimum Sample Size $n_{\\text{new}}$\nWe require a power of at least $0.80$, so $1-\\beta \\ge 0.80$, which means the Type II error rate is $\\beta \\le 0.20$.\nWe start from the power formula derived in Part 1. For a positive $\\Delta$, the term $\\Phi(-z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}})$ is very small and contributes negligibly to the total power. The conventional sample size formula relies on the approximation that power comes almost entirely from the first term:\n$$\n1 - \\beta \\approx 1 - \\Phi\\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to $\\beta \\approx \\Phi\\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} \\right)$.\nApplying the inverse normal CDF, $\\Phi^{-1}$, to both sides gives:\n$$\n\\Phi^{-1}(\\beta) \\approx z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nBy definition, $\\Phi^{-1}(\\beta) = z_{\\beta}$. Also, due to the symmetry of the normal distribution, $z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta}$.\n$$\n-z_{1-\\beta} \\approx z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the sample size $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} \\approx z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{n} \\approx \\frac{(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}{\\Delta}\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx \\frac{2\\sigma^2(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2}\n$$\nThis is the general formula for the per-arm sample size. Now, we substitute the given values:\n$\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.9600$\n$1-\\beta = 0.80 \\implies \\beta = 0.20 \\implies z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.80} \\approx 0.8416$\n$\\Delta = 0.27$\n$\\sigma^2 = 0.81$\n$$\nn_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{2(0.81)(1.9600 + 0.8416)^2}{(0.27)^2} = \\frac{1.62(2.8016)^2}{0.0729}\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1.62 \\times 7.84896256}{0.0729} = \\frac{12.7153193472}{0.0729} \\approx 174.4145\n$$\nSince the sample size must be an integer and the power must be *at least* $0.80$, we must round up to the next whole number.\nTherefore, the minimum required sample size per arm is $n_{\\text{new}} = 175$.\n\n### 4.
