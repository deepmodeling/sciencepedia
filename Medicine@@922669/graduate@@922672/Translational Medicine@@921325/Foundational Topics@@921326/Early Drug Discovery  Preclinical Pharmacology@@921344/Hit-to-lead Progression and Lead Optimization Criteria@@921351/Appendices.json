Let the weak base be denoted by $B$ and its protonated (conjugate acid) form by $BH^+$. The acid dissociation equilibrium for the conjugate acid in the aqueous phase is:\n$$BH^+_{aq} \\rightleftharpoons B_{aq} + H^+_{aq}$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this equilibrium is defined as:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[B]_{aq}[H^+]_{aq}}{[BH^+]_{aq}}$$\nThe $pK_a$ is defined as $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. The relationship between $pH$, $pK_a$, and the concentrations of the acidic and basic forms is given by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. We can rearrange the $K_a$ expression:\n$$\\log_{10}(K_a) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]_{aq}}{[BH^+]_{aq}}\\right) + \\log_{10}([H^+]_{aq})$$\n$$-pK_a = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]_{aq}}{[BH^+]_{aq}}\\right) - pH$$\n$$pH - pK_a = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]_{aq}}{[BH^+]_{aq}}\\right)$$\nFrom this, we can express the ratio of the ionized form to the neutral form:\n$$\\frac{[B]_{aq}}{[BH^+]_{aq}} = 10^{(pH - pK_a)}$$\n$$\\frac{[BH^+]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}} = 10^{(pK_a - pH)}$$\n\nNext, we define the partition coefficient, $P$, and the distribution coefficient, $D$. The partition coefficient, $P$, describes the partitioning of the single, neutral species between two immiscible phases (octanol and water). It is given by:\n$$P = \\frac{[B]_{oct}}{[B]_{aq}}$$\nThe problem states that $\\log_{10} P = 3.0$, which implies $P = 10^{3.0}$.\n\nThe distribution coefficient, $D$, accounts for all species of the compound (neutral and ionized) in the aqueous phase. Based on the problem's assumption that only the neutral form $B$ enters the octanol phase, $D$ is defined as:\n$$D = \\frac{[\\text{Total concentration in octanol}]}{[\\text{Total concentration in aqueous}]} = \\frac{[B]_{oct}}{[B]_{aq} + [BH^+]_{aq}}$$\nTo derive an expression for $D$ in terms of $P$, $pH$, and $pK_a$, we substitute $[B]_{oct} = P \\cdot [B]_{aq}$ into the expression for $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{P \\cdot [B]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq} + [BH^+]_{aq}}$$\nWe can simplify this by dividing the numerator and denominator by $[B]_{aq}$:\n$$D = \\frac{P}{1 + \\frac{[BH^+]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the ratio derived from the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship, $\\frac{[BH^+]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}} = 10^{(pK_a - pH)}$:\n$$D = \\frac{P}{1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH)}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the distribution coefficient of a monoprotic weak base. To find the expression for $\\log_{10} D$, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\log_{10} D = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P}{1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH)}}\\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10} D = \\log_{10} P - \\log_{10}\\left(1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH)}\\right)$$\nThis is the required derived expression.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $\\log_{10} D_{7.4}$ using the provided data: $\\log_{10} P = 3.0$, $pK_a = 8.0$, and $pH = 7.4$.\n$$\\log_{10} D_{7.4} = 3.0 - \\log_{10}\\left(1 + 10^{(8.0 - 7.4)}\\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10} D_{7.4} = 3.0 - \\log_{10}\\left(1 + 10^{0.6}\\right)$$\nWe calculate the value of the term in the logarithm:\n$$10^{0.6} \\approx 3.98107$$\n$$1 + 10^{0.6} \\approx 1 + 3.98107 = 4.98107$$\nNow, we compute the logarithm of this value:\n$$\\log_{10}(4.98107) \\approx 0.69732$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the equation for $\\log_{10} D_{7.4}$:\n$$\\log_{10} D_{7.4} \\approx 3.0 - 0.69732 = 2.30268$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\\log_{10} D_{7.4} \\approx 2.303$$\n\nFor the final part of the problem, we must infer the qualitative impact on CNS penetration. In lead optimization for CNS-targeted drugs, two key physicochemical parameters are the distribution coefficient at physiological pH, $\\log_{10} D_{7.4}$, and the Topological Polar Surface Area, TPSA.\n1.  **$\\log_{10} D_{7.4}$**: This parameter reflects the effective lipophilicity of the compound. For efficient transport across the lipidic Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), a compound must have sufficient lipophilicity, but excessive lipophilicity can lead to non-specific binding, rapid metabolism, or poor aqueous solubility. A widely accepted optimal range for CNS penetration is typically $1 < \\log_{10} D_{7.4} < 3$. Our calculated value of $\\log_{10} D_{7.4} \\approx 2.303$ falls squarely within this optimal range.\n2.  **TPSA**: This parameter correlates with the molecule's hydrogen bonding capacity and its ability to permeate membranes. High TPSA values are associated with poor membrane permeability. For good BBB penetration, a TPSA below $90\\,\\text{\\AA}^{2}$ is generally recommended, with values below $70\\,\\text{\\AA}^{2}$ being more favorable. The given value is $TPSA = 65\\,\\text{\\AA}^{2}$, which is well below these established cutoffs.\n\nGiven that both the calculated effective lipophilicity ($\\log_{10} D_{7.4} \\approx 2.303$) and the given polarity attribute ($TPSA = 65\\,\\text{\\AA}^{2}$) fall within their respective optimal ranges for crossing the BBB, the qualitative inference is that the compound possesses a physicochemical profile highly favorable for achieving significant CNS exposure.
