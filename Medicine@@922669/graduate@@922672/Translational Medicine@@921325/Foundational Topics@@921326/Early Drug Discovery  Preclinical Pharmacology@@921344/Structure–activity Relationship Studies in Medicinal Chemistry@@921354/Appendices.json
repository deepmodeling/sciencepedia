We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nLet the monoprotic base be denoted by the symbol $B$. In an aqueous medium, it establishes an equilibrium with its protonated form, the conjugate acid $BH^+$. This equilibrium is described by the reaction:\n$$BH^+_{(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons B_{(aq)} + H^+_{(aq)}$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for the conjugate acid $BH^+$ is defined as:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[B]_{aq}[H^+]_{aq}}{[BH^+]_{aq}}$$\nwhere $[X]_{aq}$ represents the molar concentration of species $X$ in the aqueous phase. The problem provides the base-10 logarithm of this constant, $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$.\n\nThe partition coefficient, $P$, quantifies the distribution of the neutral species, $B$, between the organic phase (1-octanol) and the aqueous phase. It is defined as:\n$$P = \\frac{[B]_{org}}{[B]_{aq}}$$\nwhere $[B]_{org}$ is the concentration of $B$ in the organic phase. The problem provides its base-10 logarithm, $\\log_{10}P$.\n\nThe pH-dependent distribution coefficient, $D_{pH}$, accounts for all species of the compound (both neutral and charged) distributing between the two phases. It is defined as the ratio of the total concentration of the compound in the organic phase to its total concentration in the aqueous phase:\n$$D_{pH} = \\frac{[Total]_{org}}{[Total]_{aq}}$$\nBased on the problem statement, we assume that the charged species, $BH^+$, has negligible solubility in the organic phase. Therefore, the total concentration in the organic phase is solely that of the neutral species:\n$$[Total]_{org} = [B]_{org}$$\nThe total concentration in the aqueous phase is the sum of the concentrations of the neutral base and its protonated form:\n$$[Total]_{aq} = [B]_{aq} + [BH^+]_{aq}$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $D_{pH}$ gives:\n$$D_{pH} = \\frac{[B]_{org}}{[B]_{aq} + [BH^+]_{aq}}$$\nTo derive an expression relating $D_{pH}$ to $P$, we can divide the numerator and the denominator of the right-hand side by $[B]_{aq}$:\n$$D_{pH} = \\frac{\\frac{[B]_{org}}{[B]_{aq}}}{\\frac{[B]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}} + \\frac{[BH^+]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}}}$$\nRecognizing that $\\frac{[B]_{org}}{[B]_{aq}} = P$ and $\\frac{[B]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}} = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$D_{pH} = \\frac{P}{1 + \\frac{[BH^+]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}}}$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{[BH^+]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}}$ can be found by rearranging the expression for $K_a$:\n$$\\frac{[BH^+]_{aq}}{[B]_{aq}} = \\frac{[H^+]_{aq}}{K_a}$$\nWe can express this ratio in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$. Since $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^+]_{aq})$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$, it follows that $[H^+]_{aq} = 10^{-pH}$ and $K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{[H^+]_{aq}}{K_a} = \\frac{10^{-pH}}{10^{-pK_a}} = 10^{-pH - (-pK_a)} = 10^{pK_a - pH}$$\nThis result could also be obtained by rearranging the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the $BH^+/B$ pair: $pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]_{aq}}{[BH^+]_{aq}}\\right)$.\n\nSubstituting this ratio back into the expression for $D_{pH}$ yields the relationship between $D_{pH}$, $P$, $pH$, and $pK_a$:\n$$D_{pH} = \\frac{P}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}}$$\nTo find the required expression for $\\log_{10} D_{pH}$, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\log_{10}(D_{pH}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(a/b) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)$, we arrive at the final derived expression:\n$$\\log_{10} D_{pH} = \\log_{10} P - \\log_{10}(1 + 10^{pK_a - pH})$$\nNow, we can compute the value of $\\log_{10} D_{pH}$ at the specified physiological $pH$. The given values are:\n$\\log_{10} P = 3.0$\n$pK_a = 8.5$\n$pH = 7.4$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\\log_{10} D_{7.4} = 3.0 - \\log_{10}(1 + 10^{8.5 - 7.4})$$\n$$\\log_{10} D_{7.4} = 3.0 - \\log_{10}(1 + 10^{1.1})$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical result:\n$$10^{1.1} \\approx 12.589254$$\n$$1 + 10^{1.1} \\approx 13.589254$$\n$$\\log_{10}(13.589254) \\approx 1.1331998$$\n$$\\log_{10} D_{7.4} \\approx 3.0 - 1.1331998$$\n$$\\log_{10} D_{7.4} \\approx 1.8668002$$\nRounding the final value to $4$ significant figures gives $1.867$.\n\nThe computed value $\\log_{10} D_{7.4} = 1.867$ represents the effective lipophilicity of the compound at physiological $pH$. The intrinsic lipophilicity of the neutral form is high ($\\log_{10} P = 3.0$), indicating it is $1000$ times more soluble in octanol than in water. However, at $pH=7.4$, which is below the $pK_a$ of $8.5$, the basic compound is predominantly in its protonated, charged form ($BH^+$) in the aqueous phase. This ionization significantly increases its aqueous solubility and thus decreases its overall tendency to partition into the lipid phase. The resulting $\\log_{10} D_{7.4}$ value of $1.867$ falls within the range often considered optimal for passive drug absorption ($1  \\log_{10} D  3$).

Estimation of the Potency Effect ($\\hat{\\mu}_p$ for $\\Delta pIC_{50}$)**\nFirst, we calculate the difference $\\Delta pIC_{50,i} = pIC_{50,\\text{F},i} - pIC_{50,\\text{Me},i}$ and its variance $\\sigma_{p,i}^2 = \\sigma_{pIC_{50},\\text{F},i}^2 + \\sigma_{pIC_{50},\\text{Me},i}^2$ for each of the five pairs.\n\n- Pair $1$: $\\Delta pIC_{50,1} = 7.52 - 7.30 = 0.22$. $\\sigma_{p,1}^2 = 0.04^2 + 0.05^2 = 0.0016 + 0.0025 = 0.0041$.\n- Pair $2$: $\\Delta pIC_{50,2} = 6.95 - 6.85 = 0.10$. $\\sigma_{p,2}^2 = 0.06^2 + 0.06^2 = 0.0036 + 0.0036 = 0.0072$.\n- Pair $3$: $\\Delta pIC_{50,3} = 8.28 - 8.10 = 0.18$. $\\sigma_{p,3}^2 = 0.05^2 + 0.04^2 = 0.0025 + 0.0016 = 0.0041$.\n- Pair $4$: $\\Delta pIC_{50,4} = 7.60 - 7.55 = 0.05$. $\\sigma_{p,4}^2 = 0.05^2 + 0.07^2 = 0.0025 + 0.0049 = 0.0074$.\n- Pair $5$: $\\Delta pIC_{50,5} = 7.20 - 6.95 = 0.25$. $\\sigma_{p,5}^2 = 0.04^2 + 0.05^2 = 0.0016 + 0.0025 = 0.0041$.\n\nNow, we calculate the weights $w_{p,i} = 1/\\sigma_{p,i}^2$ and the terms for the sum.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_{p,i} \\Delta pIC_{50,i} = \\frac{0.22}{0.0041} + \\frac{0.10}{0.0072} + \\frac{0.18}{0.0041} + \\frac{0.05}{0.0074} + \\frac{0.25}{0.0041} \\approx 179.1822 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_{p,i} = \\frac{1}{0.0041} + \\frac{1}{0.0072} + \\frac{1}{0.0041} + \\frac{1}{0.0074} + \\frac{1}{0.0041} \\approx 1005.7313 $$\nThe MLE for the potency effect is:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu}_p = \\frac{179.1822}{1005.7313} \\approx 0.178163 $$\n\n**2.
