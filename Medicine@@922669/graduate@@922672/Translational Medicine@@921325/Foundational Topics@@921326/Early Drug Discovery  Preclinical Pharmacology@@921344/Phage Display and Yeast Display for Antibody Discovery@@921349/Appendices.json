A soluble antigen is titrated, and the fraction of displayed receptors that are occupied at equilibrium is measured by flow cytometry. Consider first a monovalent soluble ligand and a single independent binding site per receptor. Starting from the law of mass action and the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, derive the equilibrium occupancy of receptors as a function of the free ligand concentration. Then analyze how multivalency of the soluble antigen together with finite display density on the yeast surface can shift the observed occupancy through avidity.\n\nAssumptions and definitions:\n- For a monovalent ligand and a monovalent receptor, the elementary reaction is $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$, where $R$ is free receptor, $L$ is free ligand, and $RL$ is the complex. The equilibrium dissociation constant is defined by $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$. The total receptor concentration is $R_{T} = [R] + [RL]$. All brackets denote equilibrium concentrations.\n- For a homobivalent ligand with two identical binding sites per molecule, define $[\\tilde{L}]$ as the concentration of ligand molecules and define $[L] := 2[\\tilde{L}]$ as the concentration of binding-competent sites (arms). The microscopic site affinity is the same as in the monovalent case, with dissociation constant $K_{d}$ per site.\n- When one arm of a homobivalent ligand is bound to a receptor on a yeast cell, the second arm can bind intramolecularly to a second receptor on the same cell with an effective local concentration $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that depends on the surface display density $D$ (number of receptors per unit membrane area). In this model, $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is taken to scale linearly with display density as $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}(D) = c_{0} D$. This captures the increase in the probability that the second arm finds a neighboring receptor as surface density increases. You may treat $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ as a concentration with the same units as $K_{d}$ and $[L]$.\n- The apparent equilibrium occupancy for the bivalent ligand case can be derived by enumerating binding states and applying the law of mass action, leading to an effective association constant $K_{a,\\mathrm{eff}} = K_{a}\\left(1 + K_{a} c_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\right)$ for a receptor to be in any bound state, where $K_{a} = \\frac{1}{K_{d}}$.

The context and methodology described are standard in the field of antibody engineering and biophysical chemistry. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Binding Isotherm for Flow Cytometry Data\n\nThe problem asks for the analytical relationship between the background-subtracted mean fluorescence signal and the ligand concentration, suitable for fitting the dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\nWe begin with the foundational principles provided. The equilibrium for a one-to-one binding interaction between a receptor (the scFv displayed on the yeast, $R$) and a ligand (the soluble antigen, $L$) to form a complex ($RL$) is described by the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex at equilibrium.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL]$$\nFrom this, we can express the free receptor concentration as $[R] = [R]_{\\text{total}} - [RL]$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the definition of $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([R]_{\\text{total}} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nOur goal is to find the fraction of occupied receptors, $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $[RL]$:\n$$K_d [RL] = ([R]_{\\text{total}} - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_d [RL] = [R]_{\\text{total}}[L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_d [RL] + [RL][L] = [R]_{\\text{total}}[L]$$\n$$[RL](K_d + [L]) = [R]_{\\text{total}}[L]$$\nDividing by $[R]_{\\text{total}}$ and $(K_d + [L])$ gives the desired fractional occupancy, $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThe problem states that the experiment is conducted under conditions where the ligand is in large excess over the receptor. This justifies the approximation that the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, $[L]$, is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration added, which we denote as $c$.\n$$[L] \\approx c$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta(c) = \\frac{c}{K_d + c}$$\nThis is the Langmuir binding isotherm, which describes the fraction of occupied sites as a function of ligand concentration.\n\nNext, we relate this microscopic property ($\\theta$) to the macroscopic observable, the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI). The problem states that the specific fluorescence signal is proportional to the number of occupied receptors. Since the experiment uses a narrow expression gate, the total number of receptors per cell, $N_{\\text{total}}$, is considered constant. The number of occupied receptors per cell is $N_{\\text{occupied}} = N_{\\text{total}} \\cdot \\theta$.\n\nLet the background-subtracted MFI be denoted as $\\Delta\\text{MFI}$. This signal is proportional to $N_{\\text{occupied}}$:\n$$\\Delta\\text{MFI}(c) \\propto N_{\\text{occupied}} = N_{\\text{total}} \\cdot \\theta(c)$$\nIntroducing a proportionality constant, $A$, we can write this as an equation:\n$$\\Delta\\text{MFI}(c) = A \\cdot \\theta(c)$$\nThe constant $A$ is an amplitude or scaling factor that represents the theoretical maximum background-subtracted signal that would be achieved at saturating ligand concentrations (i.e., as $c \\to \\infty$, $\\theta \\to 1$, and $\\Delta\\text{MFI} \\to A$). This constant encompasses the total number of receptors, the quantum yield of the fluorophore, and instrument-specific settings like laser power and detector gain.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta(c)$, we arrive at the final analytical relationship:\n$$\\Delta\\text{MFI}(c) = A \\frac{c}{K_d + c}$$\nThis equation relates the background-subtracted MFI to the ligand concentration $c$, with the unknown amplitude $A$ separated from the dissociation constant $K_d$, as required. The background-subtracted MFI is obtained by subtracting the MFI at zero ligand concentration, $B = \\text{MFI}(c=0)$, from the MFI measured at any given concentration $c$.\n$$\\Delta\\text{MFI}(c) = \\text{MFI}(c) - B$$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of $K_d$\n\nWe are given two data points at non-zero ligand concentrations and a background measurement:\n- At $c_1 = 25$ nanomolar, $\\text{MFI}(c_1) = 767$.\n- At $c_2 = 200$ nanomolar, $\\text{MFI}(c_2) = 1700$.\n- The background MFI at $c = 0$ is $B = 100$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the background-subtracted signals, which we will denote as $S_1$ and $S_2$:\n$$S_1 = \\Delta\\text{MFI}(c_1) = \\text{MFI}(c_1) - B = 767 - 100 = 667$$\n$$S_2 = \\Delta\\text{MFI}(c_2) = \\text{MFI}(c_2) - B = 1700 - 100 = 1600$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $A$ and $K_d$:\n1) $S_1 = A \\frac{c_1}{K_d + c_1}$\n2) $S_2 = A \\frac{c_2}{K_d + c_2}$\n\nTo eliminate the unknown amplitude $A$, we can rearrange both equations to solve for $A$ and then set them equal.\nFrom equation (1):\n$$A = S_1 \\frac{K_d + c_1}{c_1}$$\nFrom equation (2):\n$$A = S_2 \\frac{K_d + c_2}{c_2}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $A$:\n$$S_1 \\frac{K_d + c_1}{c_1} = S_2 \\frac{K_d + c_2}{c_2}$$\nTo solve for $K_d$, we first multiply both sides by $c_1 c_2$ to clear the denominators:\n$$S_1 c_2 (K_d + c_1) = S_2 c_1 (K_d + c_2)$$\nExpand both sides:\n$$S_1 c_2 K_d + S_1 c_1 c_2 = S_2 c_1 K_d + S_2 c_1 c_2$$\nGroup all terms containing $K_d$ on one side and all other terms on the other side:\n$$S_1 c_2 K_d - S_2 c_1 K_d = S_2 c_1 c_2 - S_1 c_1 c_2$$\nFactor out $K_d$ on the left side and $c_1 c_2$ on the right side:\n$$K_d (S_1 c_2 - S_2 c_1) = c_1 c_2 (S_2 - S_1)$$\nFinally, we isolate $K_d$ to obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$K_d = \\frac{c_1 c_2 (S_2 - S_1)}{S_1 c_2 - S_2 c_1}$$\nThis expression for $K_d$ is in terms of the known quantities $c_1$, $c_2$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ (where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are derived from the MFI and background values).\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values.

The fitnesses are $w_i = 1+s_i$, so:\n$$w_T = 1 + 3 = 4$$\n$$w_O = 1 + 0 = 1$$\nThe ratio of fitnesses is $\\frac{w_T}{w_O} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4$.\nThe initial fraction of the target clone is $\\alpha = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}$, and the target threshold is $\\tau = 0.01$. We substitute these values into the inequality:\n$$4^r \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{1 - 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}} \\ge \\frac{0.01}{1 - 0.01}$$\n$$4^r \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{1 - 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}} \\ge \\frac{0.01}{0.99} = \\frac{1}{99}$$\nNow we solve for $r$. First, isolate the term $4^r$:\n$$4^r \\ge \\frac{1}{99} \\cdot \\frac{1 - 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-8}}$$\n$$4^r \\ge \\frac{1 - 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{99 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-8})} = \\frac{1 - 2 \\times 10^{-8}}{198 \\times 10^{-8}}$$\n$$4^r \\ge \\frac{1}{198 \\times 10^{-8}} - \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-8}}{198 \\times 10^{-8}} = \\frac{10^8}{198} - \\frac{2}{198} = \\frac{100,000,000 - 2}{198} = \\frac{99,999,998}{198}$$\nCalculating the value of the right-hand side:\n$$\\frac{99,999,998}{198} \\approx 505050.4949...$$\nThe inequality is $4^r \\ge 505050.4949...$. To solve for $r$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(4^r) \\ge \\ln(505050.4949...)$$\n$$r \\ln(4) \\ge \\ln(505050.4949...)$$\n$$r \\ge \\frac{\\ln(505050.4949...)}{\\ln(4)}$$\nUsing computational tools for the logarithms:\n$$\\ln(505050.4949...) \\approx 13.132537$$\n$$\\ln(4) \\approx 1.386294$$\n$$r \\ge \\frac{13.132537}{1.386294} \\approx 9.4731$$\nSince the number of selection rounds $r$ must be an integer, the minimal integer value of $r$ that satisfies this condition is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $9.4731...$, which is $10$.\n\nTo verify, we can check the condition for $r=9$ and $r=10$:\nFor $r=9$: $4^9 = 262,144$. This is less than $505,050.49...$, so $r=9$ is insufficient.\nFor $r=10$: $4^{10} = 1,048,576$. This is greater than $505,050.49...$, so $r=10$ is sufficient.\nThe minimal integer number of rounds is $10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "5040065"}]}
