The initial velocity of the reaction, $v_0$, in the absence of an inhibitor is given by:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction velocity, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nNext, we introduce a purely competitive inhibitor, $I$. In this model, the inhibitor binds reversibly only to the free enzyme, $E$, to form an inactive enzyme-inhibitor complex, $EI$. It does not bind to the enzyme-substrate complex, $ES$. The binding equilibrium for the inhibitor is:\n$$\nE + I \\rightleftharpoons EI\n$$\nThe dissociation constant for this equilibrium is the inhibition constant, $K_i$:\n$$\nK_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}\n$$\nUnder competitive inhibition, the inhibitor effectively reduces the concentration of free enzyme available to bind the substrate. This increases the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$, without affecting the maximum velocity, $V_{max}$. The steady-state mass balance for the total enzyme, $[E]_t$, is:\n$$\n[E]_t = [E] + [ES] + [EI]\n$$\nFrom the definition of $K_i$, we can express $[EI]$ as $[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i}$. Substituting this into the mass balance equation:\n$$\n[E]_t = [E] + [ES] + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} = [E]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [ES]\n$$\nUnder the steady-state assumption of the Michaelis-Menten model, we also have $[E] = \\frac{K_m [ES]}{[S]}$. Substituting this expression for $[E]$:\n$$\n[E]_t = \\frac{K_m [ES]}{[S]}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [ES] = [ES] \\left[\\frac{K_m}{[S]}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + 1\\right]\n$$\nThe reaction velocity in the presence of the inhibitor, $v_i$, is $v_i = k_{cat}[ES]$. The maximum velocity is $V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]_t$. By substituting these relationships, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{max}}{k_{cat}} = \\frac{v_i}{k_{cat}} \\left[\\frac{K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}{[S]}\\right]\n$$\nRearranging for $v_i$ yields the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition:\n$$\nv_i = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}\n$$\nThe term $K_m(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i})$ is the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$.\n\nThe half-maximal inhibitory concentration, $IC_{50}$, is defined as the inhibitor concentration $[I]$ that reduces the reaction velocity to half of the uninhibited velocity. That is, when $[I] = IC_{50}$, the velocity $v_i$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}v_0$.\n$$\nv_i = \\frac{1}{2} v_0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_i$ (with $[I]=IC_{50}$) and $v_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} \\right)\n$$\nWe can cancel the non-zero term $V_{max}[S]$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2(K_m + [S])}\n$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives:\n$$\nK_m\\left(1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i}\\right) + [S] = 2(K_m + [S])\n$$\n$$\nK_m + \\frac{K_m IC_{50}}{K_i} + [S] = 2K_m + 2[S]\n$$\nNow, we solve for the term containing $K_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{K_m IC_{50}}{K_i} = (2K_m - K_m) + (2[S] - [S]) = K_m + [S]\n$$\nFinally, solving for $K_i$ gives:\n$$\nK_i = \\frac{K_m IC_{50}}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThis can also be expressed by solving for $IC_{50}$, which is the more common form of the Cheng-Prusoff equation for competitive inhibition:\n$$\nIC_{50} = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Mechanistic Assumptions\n\nFor this derivation and its application in target validation to be valid, several mechanistic assumptions must hold:\n1.  **Purely Competitive Inhibition:** The inhibitor binds reversibly to the enzyme's active site, precluding substrate binding. The substrate and inhibitor are mutually exclusive. Other mechanisms of inhibition (non-competitive, uncompetitive, mixed) would result in a different relationship between $K_i$ and $IC_{50}$.\n2.  **Steady-State Kinetics:** The derivation is based on the Michaelis-Menten model, which assumes that the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex $([ES])$ is constant during the initial phase of the reaction.\n3.  **Single, Reversible Binding Site:** The enzyme has one active site for the substrate and the inhibitor binds reversibly to this same site.\n4.  **No Inhibitor Depletion:** The total enzyme concentration must be significantly lower than the inhibitor concentration $([E]_t \\ll [I])$. This \"loose-binding\" condition ensures that the free inhibitor concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration, which is assumed in the derivation. If this condition is not met (i.e., for tight-binding inhibitors), a more complex model (e.g., the Morrison equation) is required.\n5.  **Simplified Substrate System:** Kinase reactions are typically bi-substrate (e.g., ATP and a peptide/protein). The use of a single-substrate model assumes that the concentration of the second substrate is held constant and is usually at a saturating level, such that the kinetics can be analyzed with respect to only one substrate (ATP in this case).\n6.  **Relevance to In Vivo context:** For the biochemically determined $K_i$ to inform the cellular experiment (CRISPRi), it is assumed that the inhibitor is cell-permeable, sufficiently stable, and highly selective for the target kinase. The Cheng-Prusoff relationship also highlights that the inhibitor's potency in a cell (cellular $IC_{50}$) will depend directly on the intracellular concentration of the competing substrate, ATP.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of $K_i$\n\nWe use the derived relationship, rearranged to solve for $K_i$:\n$$\nK_i = \\frac{IC_{50}}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}}\n$$\nThe given data are:\n- $K_m = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[S] = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $IC_{50} = 187\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{[S]}{K_m}$:\n$$\n\\frac{[S]}{K_m} = \\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 2\n$$\nNow, we substitute this value and the given $IC_{50}$ into the equation for $K_i$. The units of $K_i$ will be the same as the units of $IC_{50}$, which is $\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$\nK_i = \\frac{187\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1 + 2} = \\frac{187\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{3}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nK_i = 62.333...\\,\\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nRounding the result to $3$ significant figures as requested:\n$$\nK_i = 62.3\\,\\mathrm{nM}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{62.3}\n$$", "id": "5067332"}, {"introduction": "The cornerstone of robust target validation is demonstrating that both genetic and pharmacological perturbations of a target yield consistent phenotypic outcomes.
