By definition, $K$ is identical to $EC_{50}$. Thus, the equation can be written as:\n$$E(C) = E_0 + \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nThe drug-induced effect is the increase over baseline, which we can denote as $\\Delta E(C) = E(C) - E_0$.\n$$\\Delta E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nThe problem defines $EC_p$ as the concentration $C$ that produces an effect increment equal to a fraction $p$ of the maximal increment, $E_{\\max}$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\\Delta E(EC_p) = p \\cdot E_{\\max}$$\nSubstituting the model into this definition, we get:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot (EC_p)^n}{EC_{50}^n + (EC_p)^n} = p \\cdot E_{\\max}$$\nSince $E_{\\max}$ represents a non-zero maximal effect, we can divide both sides by $E_{\\max}$:\n$$p = \\frac{(EC_p)^n}{EC_{50}^n + (EC_p)^n}$$\nWe now solve for $EC_p$.\n$$p(EC_{50}^n + (EC_p)^n) = (EC_p)^n$$\n$$p \\cdot EC_{50}^n + p \\cdot (EC_p)^n = (EC_p)^n$$\n$$p \\cdot EC_{50}^n = (EC_p)^n - p \\cdot (EC_p)^n$$\n$$p \\cdot EC_{50}^n = (EC_p)^n (1 - p)$$\n$$(EC_p)^n = EC_{50}^n \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides yields the general formula for $EC_p$:\n$$EC_p = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)^{1/n}$$\nWe are asked to compute $EC_{90}$ for a drug with $n=1$ and $EC_{50} = 2.50$ nM. We set $p=0.90$ and $n=1$.\n$$EC_{90} = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{0.90}{1-0.90}\\right)^{1/1}$$\n$$EC_{90} = 2.50 \\text{ nM} \\times \\left(\\frac{0.90}{0.10}\\right)$$\n$$EC_{90} = 2.50 \\text{ nM} \\times 9$$\n$$EC_{90} = 22.5 \\text{ nM}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$EC_{90} = 22.50 \\text{ nM}$$\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of the Role of the Hill Coefficient ($n$)**\n\nThe Hill coefficient, $n$, quantifies the cooperativity of the drug-receptor interaction and dictates the steepness of the concentration-effect curve.\n-   If $n=1$, the relationship follows simple ligand-receptor binding kinetics (Michaelis-Menten-like), indicating no cooperativity.\n-   If $n>1$, there is positive cooperativity, meaning the binding of one drug molecule increases the affinity for subsequent molecules.\n-   If $n<1$, there is negative cooperativity, where binding of one molecule decreases the affinity for others.\n\n**Effect on Curve Steepness and Pharmacologic Sensitivity Window:**\nThe steepness of the curve is best understood by examining the range of concentrations required to transition from a low level of effect to a high level. A common metric is the ratio of concentrations needed for $90\\%$ and $10\\%$ of the maximal effect, i.e., the ratio $EC_{90}/EC_{10}$. Using the general formula derived above:\n$$EC_{90} = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{0.9}{1-0.9}\\right)^{1/n} = EC_{50} \\cdot 9^{1/n}$$\n$$EC_{10} = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{0.1}{1-0.1}\\right)^{1/n} = EC_{50} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^{1/n}$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{EC_{90}}{EC_{10}} = \\frac{EC_{50} \\cdot 9^{1/n}}{EC_{50} \\cdot (1/9)^{1/n}} = \\frac{9^{1/n}}{9^{-1/n}} = 9^{2/n}$$\nThis ratio defines the pharmacologic sensitivity window.\n-   For $n=1$ (the case in the problem), the ratio is $9^{2/1} = 81$. An $81$-fold increase in concentration is required to move from $10\\%$ to $90\\%$ effect. This represents a relatively broad sensitivity window.\n-   For $n=2$ (positive cooperativity), the ratio is $9^{2/2} = 9$. Only a $9$-fold concentration change is needed. The curve is steeper, and the sensitivity window is narrower.\n-   For $n=4$ (strong cooperativity), the ratio is $9^{2/4} = 9^{1/2} = 3$. An extremely steep transition occurs over a very narrow concentration range.\nAs $n$ increases, the ratio $EC_{90}/EC_{10}$ decreases, signifying a steeper concentration-effect curve and a narrower pharmacologic sensitivity window.\n\n**Implications for Dosing Precision and Therapeutic Index (TI):**\n1.  **Dosing Precision:** A steep concentration-effect curve (high $n$) means that small fluctuations in drug concentration—due to dosing errors, food effects, drug-drug interactions, or inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability—can cause large and potentially dangerous shifts in pharmacologic effect. This demands greater dosing precision to keep the drug concentration within its desired therapeutic range. A shallow curve (low $n$) is more \"forgiving\" of such variations.\n\n2.  **Therapeutic Index (TI):** The TI classically compares the concentration causing toxicity to that causing efficacy (e.g., $TC_{50}/EC_{50}$). While a high TI is desirable, the Hill coefficients for the efficacy ($n_{eff}$) and toxicity ($n_{tox}$) curves are critically important. A drug with an acceptable TI might still be hazardous if its toxicity curve is extremely steep (high $n_{tox}$). In such a case, the concentration range between the top of the therapeutic effect (e.g., $EC_{90}$) and the onset of unacceptable toxicity (e.g., $TC_{10}$) could be dangerously narrow. A small overdose could rapidly escalate the effect from therapeutic to toxic. Therefore, a steep dose-response relationship can shrink the practical therapeutic window, increasing the risk of adverse events and making the drug less safe, regardless of a favorable-appearing TI based on midpoint values.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.50}$$", "id": "5041101"}, {"introduction": "A drug's clinical performance depends not only on its intrinsic potency but also on its journey through the body.
