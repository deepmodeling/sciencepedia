Note that for F1, $k_{a,1} > k_e$, while for F2, $k_{a,2}  k_e$.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Area Under the Curve (AUC)**\n\nThe total area under the concentration-time curve from time $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$, denoted as $AUC_{0-\\infty}$, represents the total systemic exposure to the drug. It is fundamentally defined by the relationship:\n$$ AUC_{0-\\infty} = \\frac{\\text{Amount of drug systemically available}}{\\text{Clearance}} $$\nIn terms of the model parameters, this is:\n$$ AUC_{0-\\infty} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL} $$\nThe problem explicitly states that the bioavailability ($F$), dose ($D$), and systemic clearance ($CL$) are identical for both formulations. Since $F$, $D$, and $CL$ are unchanged, the $AUC_{0-\\infty}$ must also be **unchanged**. The rate of absorption ($k_a$) does not appear in this fundamental equation for total exposure.\n\nFor completeness, we calculate the value:\n$$ AUC = \\frac{1.0 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{15\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h}^{-1}} \\approx 6.67\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}} $$\nThis value is the same for F1 and F2.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Time to Maximum Concentration ($T_{max}$)**\n\nThe time to maximum concentration, $T_{max}$, is found by setting the first derivative of the concentration function $C(t)$ to zero.\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\frac{F D k_a}{V(k_a - k_e)} (-k_e e^{-k_e t} + k_a e^{-k_a t}) = 0 $$\nFor $t = T_{max}$, we have:\n$$ k_a e^{-k_a T_{max}} = k_e e^{-k_e T_{max}} $$\nSolving for $T_{max}$:\n$$ \\frac{k_a}{k_e} = e^{(k_a - k_e)T_{max}} $$\n$$ T_{max} = \\frac{\\ln(k_a/k_e)}{k_a - k_e} $$\nWe now calculate $T_{max}$ for both formulations:\n- For F1: $k_{a,1} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_e = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$$ T_{max,1} = \\frac{\\ln(2.0/0.3)}{2.0 - 0.3} = \\frac{\\ln(6.667)}{1.7} \\approx \\frac{1.897}{1.7} \\approx 1.12\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\n- For F2: $k_{a,2} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_e = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$$ T_{max,2} = \\frac{\\ln(0.25/0.3)}{0.25 - 0.3} = \\frac{\\ln(0.8333)}{-0.05} \\approx \\frac{-0.1823}{-0.05} \\approx 3.65\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\nSince $T_{max,2} > T_{max,1}$, decreasing the absorption rate constant $k_a$ results in an **increase** in $T_{max}$. This is expected, as a slower absorption process naturally takes longer to reach its peak concentration.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Maximum Concentration ($C_{max}$)**\n\nThe maximum concentration, $C_{max}$, is the value of $C(t)$ at $t = T_{max}$. A convenient expression for $C_{max}$ is obtained by substituting the $T_{max}$ condition back into the concentration equation. A particularly insightful form is:\n$$ C_{max} = \\frac{F D}{V} e^{-k_e T_{max}} $$\nThis equation shows that $C_{max}$ is directly proportional to the term $e^{-k_e T_{max}}$. As we have already established, switching from F1 to F2 causes $T_{max}$ to increase. Since $k_e$ is a positive constant, an increase in $T_{max}$ will cause the exponential term $e^{-k_e T_{max}}$ to decrease. Consequently, $C_{max}$ must **decrease**.\n\nLet's calculate the specific values:\n- For F1: $T_{max,1} \\approx 1.12\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n$$ C_{max,1} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{50\\,\\mathrm{L}} e^{-0.3 \\times 1.12} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}} \\times e^{-0.336} \\approx 2.0 \\times 0.7146 \\approx 1.43\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}} $$\n- For F2: $T_{max,2} \\approx 3.65\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n$$ C_{max,2} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{50\\,\\mathrm{L}} e^{-0.3 \\times 3.65} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}} \\times e^{-1.095} \\approx 2.0 \\times 0.3345 \\approx 0.67\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}} $$\nAs predicted, $C_{max,2}  C_{max,1}$, confirming that $C_{max}$ decreases. This lower, delayed peak is the characteristic and intended effect of a controlled-release formulation.\n\n**Summary of Effects:**\n- $T_{max}$: Increases\n- $C_{max}$: Decreases\n- $AUC$: Unchanged\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $T_{max}$ increases, $C_{max}$ decreases, and $AUC$ is unchanged.**\n- This option correctly states that $T_{max}$ increases, $C_{max}$ decreases, and AUC remains unchanged, which is fully consistent with our derivation from first principles.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. $T_{max}$ decreases, $C_{max}$ increases, and $AUC$ is unchanged.**\n- The statements regarding $T_{max}$ and $C_{max}$ are the opposite of what is predicted by the kinetic model.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. $T_{max}$ increases, $C_{max}$ is unchanged, and $AUC$ decreases due to slower absorption.**\n- The statement that $C_{max}$ is unchanged is incorrect.\n- The statement that AUC decreases is incorrect.

Therefore, the amount of drug that becomes systemically available from a single dose is:\n    $$ \\text{Amount Absorbed} = F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} $$\n\n2.  **Amount of Drug Eliminated from the Body:**\n    The problem states that the derivation should use the definition of clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}$. Systemic clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. The rate of elimination of a drug from the body at any time $t$ is proportional to its plasma concentration $C(t)$:\n    $$ \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C(t) $$\n    To find the total amount of drug eliminated over one dosing interval at steady state, from time $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$, we must integrate the rate of elimination over this interval. Let $C_{ss}(t)$ represent the plasma concentration at time $t$ during the dosing interval at steady state.\n    $$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C_{ss}(t) \\, dt $$\n    Since the problem states that systemic clearance $\\mathrm{CL}$ is constant, we can move it outside the integral:\n    $$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) \\, dt $$\n    The integral term, $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) \\, dt$, is by definition the area under the plasma concentration–time curve over one dosing interval at steady state, denoted as $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$.\n    Therefore, the amount eliminated over one dosing interval is:\n    $$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss} $$\n\n3.  **Applying the Mass Balance Principle:**\n    At steady state, the amount absorbed equals the amount eliminated over one dosing interval:\n    $$ \\text{Amount Absorbed} = \\text{Amount Eliminated} $$\n    Substituting the expressions derived above:\n    $$ F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss} $$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Maintenance Dose:**\n    The clinical objective is to achieve a target exposure, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{target}}$. We set $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$ to this target value.\n    $$ F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{target}} $$\n    Solving for the required maintenance dose, $\\mathrm{Dose}$:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Dose} = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{target}}}{F} $$\n    This is the derived expression for the maintenance dose.\n\n**Step 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the derived formula.\n-   $\\mathrm{CL} = 11.5\\,\\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}$\n-   $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{target}} = 62\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}$\n-   $F = 0.46$ (dimensionless)\n\n$$ \\mathrm{Dose} = \\frac{(11.5\\,\\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}) \\cdot (62\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}})}{0.46} $$\nFirst, we verify the units of the resulting dose:\n$$ \\frac{(\\mathrm{L} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\mathrm{h} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1})}{\\text{dimensionless}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{h}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\mathrm{L}} = \\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe units are correct.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\mathrm{Dose} = \\frac{11.5 \\cdot 62}{0.46} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Dose} = \\frac{713}{0.46} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Dose} = 1550\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1550$. When written as $1550$, it implicitly has four significant figures.\n\nThe value for the dosing interval, $\\tau = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$, was not directly used in the calculation because the target was specified in terms of $\\mathrm{AUC}$ over a dosing interval, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}$. The fundamental relationship $F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$ is independent of $\\tau$. The information confirms the context is a multiple-dosing regimen with a defined interval.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1550}$$", "id": "5043374"}]}
