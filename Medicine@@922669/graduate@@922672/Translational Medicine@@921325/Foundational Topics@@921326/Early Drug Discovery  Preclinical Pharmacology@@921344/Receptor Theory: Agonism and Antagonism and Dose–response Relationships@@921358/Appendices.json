I will proceed with a detailed solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe analysis will be based on the following key concepts:\n1.  **Receptor Occupancy**: For a simple bimolecular interaction $L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$, the fractional occupancy ($p$) of receptors by a ligand ($L$) is given by the Langmuir isotherm:\n    $$p = \\frac{[LR]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D}$$\n    where $[L]$ is the ligand concentration, $[R_T]$ is the total receptor concentration, and $K_D$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant.\n\n2.  **Hill-Langmuir Equation**: The relationship between agonist concentration $[L]$ and the observed effect $E$ is commonly modeled by the sigmoidal Hill equation:\n    $$E = E_{\\text{baseline}} + (E_{\\max} - E_{\\text{baseline}}) \\frac{[L]^n}{[L]^n + EC_{50}^n}$$\n    For simplicity, we assume $E_{\\text{baseline}}=0$, giving:\n    $$E = E_{\\max} \\frac{[L]^n}{[L]^n + EC_{50}^n}$$\n    Here, $E_{\\max}$ is the maximal effect, $EC_{50}$ is the concentration of ligand that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal effect, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient that determines the steepness of the curve.\n\n3.  **Operational Model of Agonism**: This model provides a more sophisticated link between binding and effect. Receptor activation creates a \"stimulus\" $S$, and the effect $E$ is a function of this stimulus. The stimulus depends on the total receptor concentration $[R_T]$, the agonist's affinity ($1/K_D$), and its intrinsic efficacy ($\\tau$).\n    $$S = \\frac{\\tau [R_T] [L]}{K_D + [L]}$$\n    The effect is a hyperbolic function of the stimulus:\n    $$E = \\frac{E_{sys\\_max} S}{K_E + S}$$\n    where $E_{sys\\_max}$ is the maximum response the system can produce and $K_E$ is the stimulus required for a half-maximal response. From this model, one can derive expressions for the observable parameters $EC_{50}$ and $E_{\\max}$:\n    $$E_{\\max} = E_{sys\\_max} \\frac{\\tau [R_T]}{K_E + \\tau [R_T]}$$\n    $$EC_{50} = K_D \\frac{K_E}{K_E + \\tau [R_T]}$$\n\nWith this framework, we can evaluate each statement.\n\n#### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A reversible competitive antagonist at a fixed concentration causes a parallel rightward shift of the agonist concentration–response curve such that the parameter associated with potency increases (i.e., $EC_{50}$ increases by a dose ratio), while $E_{\\max}$ and $n$ remain unchanged.**\n\nA reversible competitive antagonist ($A$) competes with the agonist ($L$) for the same binding site on the receptor. This competition effectively increases the amount of agonist required to achieve a given level of receptor occupancy. The apparent dissociation constant of the agonist becomes $K_{D,app} = K_D (1 + [A]/K_A)$, where $[A]$ is the antagonist concentration and $K_A$ is its dissociation constant. This leads to a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve. The magnitude of the shift is given by the dose ratio, $dr = 1 + [A]/K_A$. The new $EC_{50}$ is given by $EC'_{50} = EC_{50} \\cdot dr$. Since the antagonism is reversible, sufficiently high concentrations of the agonist can overcome the block and elicit the same maximal response, so $E_{\\max}$ is unchanged. The parallel nature of the shift means the shape of the curve is preserved, so the Hill coefficient $n$ also remains unchanged.\n\nThe statement says \"the parameter associated with potency increases (i.e., $EC_{50}$ increases...)\". Potency is a concept, while $EC_{50}$ is its quantitative measure. High potency corresponds to a low $EC_{50}$ value. The phrasing is slightly confusing, as an increase in the numerical value of $EC_{50}$ signifies a *decrease* in potency. However, the clause \"i.e., $EC_{50}$ increases\" clarifies that the statement refers to the numerical value of the parameter $EC_{50}$ increasing. All other parts of the statement — parallel rightward shift, increase in $EC_{50}$ by a dose ratio, unchanged $E_{\\max}$ and $n$ — are classic and correct descriptions of reversible competitive antagonism.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The slope parameter $n$ is, in general, equal to the exact number of ligand binding sites per receptor across all systems; therefore, measuring $n$ allows one to count binding sites.**\n\nThis is a common historical misconception. The Hill coefficient, $n$, is an empirical parameter that describes the steepness (sigmoidicity) of the response curve. While $n > 1$ indicates positive cooperativity (the binding of one ligand molecule facilitates the binding of others, or downstream amplification steps exist), it is not a direct measure of the stoichiometry of ligand binding. For example, signal amplification in intracellular cascades (e.g., G-protein signaling where one receptor can activate multiple G-proteins) can lead to a steep concentration-response curve with $n > 1$ even if the agonist binds to a single site on the receptor. Conversely, the presence of multiple receptor populations with different affinities can result in $n  1$. The classic example of hemoglobin, which has $4$ oxygen binding sites, exhibits a Hill coefficient of approximately $2.8$, not $4$. Thus, $n$ is a measure of cooperativity and system gain, not a literal count of binding sites.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For a full agonist, a reduction of receptor reserve without altering intrinsic efficacy increases $EC_{50}$ and can reduce $E_{\\max}$ if the reserve is sufficiently depleted.**\n\n\"Receptor reserve\" (or spare receptors) refers to the situation where a maximal effect ($E_{\\max}$) can be achieved by an agonist at a concentration where not all receptors are occupied. This occurs in highly efficient systems. A reduction of receptor reserve means a decrease in the total number of functional receptors, $[R_T]$, which can be achieved by an irreversible antagonist or genetic knockdown as mentioned in the problem statement.\nUsing the operational model equations:\n$EC_{50} = K_D \\frac{K_E}{K_E + \\tau [R_T]}$\n$E_{\\max} = E_{sys\\_max} \\frac{\\tau [R_T]}{K_E + \\tau [R_T]}$\nWhen $[R_T]$ is decreased:\n- The term $\\tau [R_T]$ in the denominator of the expression for $EC_{50}$ decreases. This makes the fraction $\\frac{K_E}{K_E + \\tau [R_T]}$ larger, thus increasing $EC_{50}$.\n- For $E_{\\max}$, if there is a large initial reserve, $\\tau [R_T] \\gg K_E$, so $E_{\\max} \\approx E_{sys\\_max}$. A small reduction in $[R_T]$ may not change $E_{\\max}$ significantly. However, if the reduction is large enough (\"sufficiently depleted\"), the term $\\tau [R_T]$ becomes comparable to or smaller than $K_E$, causing the fraction $\\frac{\\tau [R_T]}{K_E + \\tau [R_T]}$ to decrease, thus reducing $E_{\\max}$.\nThis statement accurately describes the theoretical and experimentally observed effects of reducing receptor number in a system with receptor reserve.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. A positive allosteric modulator that increases agonist affinity but does not change intrinsic efficacy is expected to decrease $EC_{50}$ without changing $E_{\\max}$ or $n$.**\n\nA positive allosteric modulator (PAM) binds to a site distinct from the agonist binding site and enhances receptor function. The problem specifies a PAM that \"increases agonist affinity\", which means it decreases the agonist's dissociation constant, $K_D$. It also specifies that \"intrinsic efficacy\" ($\\tau$) is unchanged.\nLooking at the operational model equations again:\n$EC_{50} = K_D \\frac{K_E}{K_E + \\tau [R_T]}$\n$E_{\\max} = E_{sys\\_max} \\frac{\\tau [R_T]}{K_E + \\tau [R_T]}$\n- A decrease in $K_D$ directly leads to a proportional decrease in $EC_{50}$. The agonist becomes more potent.\n- The expression for $E_{\\max}$ does not contain $K_D$. Since $\\tau$ and $[R_T]$ are unchanged, $E_{\\max}$ remains constant.\n- The effect on the Hill coefficient $n$ can be complex. However, for a simple model of a PAM that only modulates affinity, it is often assumed and observed that the cooperativity is not altered, meaning $n$ remains unchanged. The concentration-response curve shifts to the left without changing its maximum or shape. This is the most straightforward interpretation within the Hill-Langmuir framework.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. In a system where a partial agonist produces a lower $E_{\\max}$ than a reference full agonist, the lower $E_{\\max}$ is due to reduced potency (i.e., a larger $EC_{50}$) rather than differences in intrinsic efficacy.**\n\nThis statement confuses the definitions of efficacy and potency.\n- **Efficacy** is the ability of a drug-receptor complex to produce a response. It is quantified by $E_{\\max}$ (for the system) or by the parameter $\\tau$ (intrinsic efficacy, for the drug). A partial agonist is, by definition, an agonist with lower intrinsic efficacy ($\\tau$) than a full agonist. This lower $\\tau$ is the direct cause of its inability to produce the same maximal effect as a full agonist in the same system.\n- **Potency** refers to the concentration of a drug required to produce a given effect. It is quantified by $EC_{50}$.\nThe statement claims the lower $E_{\\max}$ is due to lower potency (higher $EC_{50}$) *instead of* lower efficacy. This is fundamentally incorrect. The primary cause of the lower $E_{\\max}$ is the lower intrinsic efficacy. While it is often true that a partial agonist is also less potent (has a higher $EC_{50}$) than a structurally related full agonist, the lower $E_{\\max}$ is a direct consequence of reduced efficacy, not a consequence of reduced potency. Potency and efficacy are distinct properties of an agonist.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. When the effect is directly proportional to fractional receptor occupancy and binding occurs to a single, noninteracting class of sites, the concentration producing half-maximal effect equals the equilibrium dissociation constant (i.e., $EC_{50} = K_D$), and the slope parameter is $n=1$.**\n\nThis describes the simplest model of drug action, first proposed by A.J. Clark.\n1. \"Binding occurs to a single, noninteracting class of sites\": This implies the binding follows the simple Langmuir isotherm: $p = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D}$.\n2. \"Effect is directly proportional to fractional receptor occupancy\": We can write this as $E = \\alpha \\cdot p$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant of proportionality.\nThe maximal effect, $E_{\\max}$, occurs at saturating ligand concentration, where $p \\to 1$. Thus, $E_{\\max} = \\alpha$.\nSubstituting these into the effect equation:\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\cdot p = E_{\\max} \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D}$$\nThis equation has the exact form of the Hill equation with a Hill coefficient $n=1$.\nTo find the $EC_{50}$, we set $E = E_{\\max}/2$:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\max}}{2} = E_{\\max} \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D} \\implies [L] + K_D = 2[L] \\implies [L] = K_D$$\nBy definition, this concentration $[L]$ is the $EC_{50}$. Therefore, $EC_{50} = K_D$.\nThe statement is a perfect summary of the predictions of Clark's receptor theory.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "4549990"}, {"introduction": "The relationship between receptor occupancy and biological response is often nonlinear, giving rise to the crucial concept of 'spare receptors' or receptor reserve.

The fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist ($y$) is described by the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n    $$y = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_D}$$\n    where $[A]$ is the agonist concentration and $K_D$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The $K_D$ represents the agonist concentration at which 50% of the receptors are occupied.\n\n2.  **Concentration-Response Relationship:** The physiological or biochemical response ($E$) is a function of the agonist-induced stimulus. The $EC_{50}$ is the agonist concentration that produces 50% of the maximal response ($E_{max}$).\n\n3.  **Spare Receptors (Receptor Reserve):** In many systems, a maximal response ($E_{max}$) is achieved when only a fraction of the total receptors are occupied. This phenomenon is known as having spare receptors. A direct consequence is that the concentration required to elicit a half-maximal response is lower than the concentration required to occupy half of the receptors. Therefore, the presence of spare receptors is indicated when $EC_{50}  K_D$. The magnitude of the ratio $K_D / EC_{50}$ is often taken as an index of the size of the receptor reserve. The baseline data provided ($EC_{50} = 3 \\text{ nM}$, $K_D = 30 \\text{ nM}$) clearly shows $EC_{50} \\ll K_D$, indicating a significant receptor reserve in this tissue.\n\n4.  **Irreversible Receptor Antagonism:** An irreversible antagonist binds to and permanently inactivates receptors, reducing the total number of available receptors, $[R]_{total}$.\n    *   **In a system with spare receptors:** Initially, inactivating a fraction of receptors will not decrease $E_{max}$. The system compensates by \"using\" the spare receptors. To generate the same response from a smaller pool of receptors, a higher fractional occupancy of the *remaining* receptors is needed, which in turn requires a higher agonist concentration. This manifests as a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve (increase in $EC_{50}$). Only after enough receptors are inactivated to exhaust the reserve will $E_{max}$ begin to decrease. This is consistent with the report from Laboratory 1, where after 70% inactivation, $E_{max}$ remains near 100% but $EC_{50}$ increases from 3 nM to 10 nM.\n    *   **In a system with no spare receptors:** The response is directly proportional to the number of occupied receptors ($EC_{50} = K_D$). In this case, any reduction in the total number of receptors $[R]_{total}$ will lead to a proportional reduction in $E_{max}$. Since the $K_D$ of the agonist for the remaining receptors is unchanged, the $EC_{50}$ will also remain largely unchanged. This pattern is approximated by the report from Laboratory 2 and would be expected in a system with very few or no spare receptors.\n\n5.  **Downstream Noncompetitive Blockade:** This involves inhibition of a component of the signaling pathway *downstream* of the receptor (e.g., a G-protein, an effector enzyme). This limits the maximum output of the entire system. It does not affect agonist-receptor binding ($K_D$ is unchanged). Consequently, it reduces $E_{max}$ in a way that cannot be overcome by increasing agonist concentration (insurmountable antagonism). Because the upstream binding kinetics are unaffected, the $EC_{50}$ (which reflects the concentration producing half of the *new, reduced* $E_{max}$) remains unchanged. The final experiment described, where inhibiting a downstream enzyme by 50% reduces $E_{max}$ to 50% with no change in $EC_{50}$, perfectly illustrates this principle.\n\nNow we evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**A. Preservation of $E_{max}$ over a range of receptor inactivation with a rightward shift (increase) in $EC_{50}$ is diagnostic of spare receptors; loss of $E_{max}$ appears only after extensive receptor depletion.**\nThis statement accurately describes the hallmark of a system with a receptor reserve when challenged with an irreversible antagonist. The reserve allows the system to maintain its maximal response capabilities despite the loss of some receptors. This compensation requires higher agonist concentrations, hence the rightward shift in $EC_{50}$. The maximal response only falls after the reserve is depleted. The data from Laboratory 1 is a textbook example of this phenomenon.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A proportional reduction in $E_{max}$ with minimal change in $EC_{50}$ after irreversible receptor inactivation is characteristic of spare receptors.**\nThis statement is the opposite of the correct principle. As established above, a proportional reduction in $E_{max}$ combined with a stable $EC_{50}$ is characteristic of a system with *no* spare receptors. The presence of spare receptors specifically *prevents* an immediate, proportional drop in $E_{max}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. If baseline $EC_{50} \\ll K_D$ and $EC_{50}$ moves toward $K_D$ as receptors are irreversibly inactivated while $E_{max}$ remains initially unchanged, this supports the presence of spare receptors and helps exclude downstream noncompetitive blockade.**\nThis statement combines three powerful and correct diagnostic criteria.\n1.  $EC_{50} \\ll K_D$ is the fundamental static indicator of a receptor reserve at baseline.\n2.  As spare receptors are depleted, the system becomes less efficient, and the $EC_{50}$ must increase, approaching the value of $K_D$. This dynamic change is a key signature.\n3.  This entire process occurs while $E_{max}$ is initially preserved.\nIn contrast, downstream noncompetitive blockade would cause a drop in $E_{max}$ without a shift in $EC_{50}$. Therefore, observing the shift in $EC_{50}$ toward $K_D$ while $E_{max}$ is maintained is a robust way to identify a receptor reserve and rule out downstream blockade as the cause of any eventual drop in $E_{max}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Downstream noncompetitive blockade of signaling is best identified by a parallel rightward shift of the agonist curve with preserved $E_{max}$.**\nThis statement describes the effect of a *competitive* antagonist, not a downstream noncompetitive blockade. A competitive antagonist competes with the agonist for the same binding site, making the agonist appear less potent (rightward shift, increased $EC_{50}$) but not affecting the maximal response ($E_{max}$ is preserved), as its effect can be surmounted by a high concentration of agonist. Downstream noncompetitive blockade reduces $E_{max}$ with no change in $EC_{50}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Comparing two agonists of different intrinsic efficacy, under receptor depletion the high-efficacy agonist preserves $E_{max}$ longer than the low-efficacy agonist, whereas under downstream noncompetitive blockade both agonists exhibit a similar fractional reduction of $E_{max}$; this comparison helps discriminate spare receptors from downstream blockade.**\nThis describes a sophisticated but valid experimental strategy.\n*   **Intrinsic efficacy** determines how effectively a bound agonist activates its receptor. A high-efficacy agonist (full agonist) may need to occupy only a few percent of receptors for $E_{max}$, thus having a large receptor reserve. A low-efficacy agonist (partial agonist) may need to occupy a much larger percentage of receptors for its maximal effect, thus having a small or no receptor reserve.\n*   **Under receptor depletion:** The high-efficacy agonist's large reserve allows it to maintain $E_{max}$ even after significant receptor loss. The low-efficacy agonist's $E_{max}$ will fall much more readily.\n*   **Under downstream blockade:** The blockade imposes a new ceiling on the system's output that affects all agonists. If the maximal possible system response is cut in half, the observed $E_{max}$ for both the high- and low-efficacy agonists will be cut by a similar proportion.\nThis differential effect under receptor depletion versus the similar effect under downstream blockade provides a clear method for distinguishing the two mechanisms.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "4987017"}, {"introduction": "After conceptually understanding antagonism, the next step is to quantify it from experimental data.

The analysis involves several steps: data transformation, linear regression, statistical hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and classification of the antagonism mechanism. The entire process is grounded in the principles of receptor theory and the law of mass action.\n\nThe theoretical basis for this analysis is the Schild equation, which describes the relationship between the concentration of a competitive antagonist, $[B]$, and the dose ratio, $DR$. The dose ratio is the factor by which the agonist concentration must be increased to produce the same response as in the absence of the antagonist. For a simple, reversible, competitive antagonist, the relationship is given by the Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$\nDR = 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\n$$\nwhere $K_B$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the antagonist-receptor complex. A lower $K_B$ signifies a higher affinity of the antagonist for the receptor.\n\nTo facilitate linear analysis, this equation is rearranged and logarithmically transformed. Subtracting $1$ from both sides and taking the base-10 logarithm yields the Schild equation:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(DR - 1) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right) = \\log_{10}([B]) - \\log_{10}(K_B)\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\log_{10}(DR - 1)$.\n- The independent variable is $x = \\log_{10}([B])$.\n- The theoretical slope is $m = 1$.\n- The theoretical y-intercept is $c = -\\log_{10}(K_B)$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds through the following computational steps for each test case:\n\n1.  **Data Transformation**: For each given pair of antagonist concentration $[B_i]$ and dose ratio $DR_i$, we compute the coordinates for the Schild plot:\n    $$\n    x_i = \\log_{10}([B_i]) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_i = \\log_{10}(DR_i - 1)\n    $$\n    The problem statement guarantees that $DR_i > 1$, ensuring that $y_i$ is well-defined.\n\n2.  **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression**: We fit a line $y = mx + c$ to the transformed data points $(x_i, y_i)$. The slope $m$ and intercept $c$ are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared vertical distances between the data points and the regression line. The formulas for the OLS estimators are:\n    $$\n    m = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i)}{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    c = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - m \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\right)\n    $$\n    where $n$ is the number of data points.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis Test for the Slope**: A key diagnostic for competitive antagonism is whether the empirical slope $m$ is consistent with the theoretical value of $1$. We perform a two-sided t-test for the null hypothesis $H_0: m = 1$ against the alternative $H_a: m \\neq 1$.\n    - The test statistic is calculated as:\n      $$\n      t = \\frac{m - 1}{SE(m)}\n      $$\n      where $SE(m)$ is the standard error of the slope.\n    - $SE(m)$ is derived from the variance of the residuals. The residuals are $e_i = y_i - (mx_i + c)$. The estimate of the error variance is:\n      $$\n      s_e^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2}{n-2}\n      $$\n      where $df = n-2$ are the degrees of freedom.\n    - The standard error of the slope is then:\n      $$\n      SE(m) = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_e^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}\n      $$\n    - The $p$-value is computed from the t-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom: $p = 2 \\cdot P(T_{n-2} > |t|)$. The slope is considered to deviate significantly from $1$ if $p  \\alpha$ for a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n4.  **Estimation of the Antagonist Dissociation Constant ($K_B$)**: The method for estimating $K_B$ depends on the outcome of the hypothesis test.\n    - If $H_0$ is not rejected ($p \\geq 0.05$), we assume the simple competitive antagonism model holds. The estimated intercept $c$ is an estimate of $-\\log_{10}(K_B)$. Therefore, $K_B$ is calculated as:\n      $$\n      K_B = 10^{-c}\n      $$\n    - If $H_0$ is rejected ($p  0.05$), the slope deviates from unity, indicating a departure from the ideal model. In this case, the problem specifies estimating an apparent affinity parameter. This value is the antagonist concentration that produces a dose ratio of $2$. This corresponds to the point on the regression line where $y = \\log_{10}(2-1) = 0$. The x-intercept of the Schild plot gives $\\log_{10}([B])$ at this point.\n      $$\n      0 = m \\log_{10}([B]) + c \\implies \\log_{10}([B]) = -\\frac{c}{m}\n      $$\n      This concentration, an apparent $K_B$, is calculated as:\n      $$\n      K_B = 10^{-c/m}\n      $$\n\n5.  **Interpretation of the Antagonism Mechanism**: A decision rule is applied to classify the antagonism.\n    - First, we check for surmountability. If the minimal observed maximal response ratio, $r_{\\max} = \\min(R_{\\max})$, is less than $0.9$, the antagonist is considered to have depressed the maximal possible response, characteristic of **insurmountable antagonism** (code $2$).\n    - If the maximal response is preserved ($r_{\\max} \\geq 0.9$), the classification depends on the Schild slope. If the slope is not significantly different from $1$ ($p \\geq 0.05$), the a priori model is validated, and the mechanism is classified as **competitive antagonism** (code $0$).\n    - If the maximal response is preserved but the slope significantly deviates from $1$ ($p  0.05$), the mechanism is classified as **noncompetitive antagonism** (code $1$). This category includes allosteric modulation or other complex interactions that alter the agonist's affinity or efficacy in a manner not described by the simple competitive model, but without depressing the maximum response to the levels of insurmountability.\n\nAll floating-point numerical results ($m$, $p$, and $K_B$) are rounded to six decimal places as required.
