Consider a thin spherical shell within the organoid, with an inner radius $r$ and an outer radius $r+dr$. At steady state, the net rate of oxygen diffusing into this shell must be equal to the rate of oxygen consumed by the cells within the shell's volume.\n\nThe molar flux of oxygen, $J(r)$, in the radial direction is described by Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$J(r) = -D \\frac{dC}{dr}$$\nwhere $D$ is the oxygen diffusivity and $C(r)$ is the oxygen concentration at radius $r$.\n\nThe rate of oxygen diffusion into the shell at radius $r$ is the flux multiplied by the surface area of the inner sphere, $A(r) = 4\\pi r^2$:\n$$\\text{Rate In} = A(r) J(r) = (4\\pi r^2) \\left(-D \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right)$$\n\nSimilarly, the rate of oxygen diffusion out of the shell at radius $r+dr$ is:\n$$\\text{Rate Out} = A(r+dr) J(r+dr) \\approx (4\\pi (r+dr)^2) J(r+dr)$$\n\nThe net rate of diffusion into the shell is the difference between the rate in and the rate out. This can be expressed as the negative divergence of the total flow rate, $A(r)J(r)$:\n$$\\text{Net Diffusion Rate} = -\\frac{d}{dr}(A(r)J(r))dr = -\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(4\\pi r^2 \\left(-D \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right)\\right) dr = 4\\pi D \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) dr$$\n\nThe rate of oxygen consumption within the shell is the uniform, zero-order consumption rate, $q$, multiplied by the volume of the shell, $dV = 4\\pi r^2 dr$:\n$$\\text{Consumption Rate} = q \\cdot dV = q(4\\pi r^2 dr)$$\n\nEquating the net diffusion rate to the consumption rate for the mass balance at steady state:\n$$4\\pi D \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) dr = q(4\\pi r^2 dr)$$\n\nDividing by $4\\pi dr$ and rearranging gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the oxygen concentration profile:\n$$\\frac{D}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) = q$$\nor\n$$\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{q}{D} r^2$$\n\nTo solve this second-order ODE, we integrate it twice. The first integration with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{q}{D} \\frac{r^3}{3} + K_1$$\nwhere $K_1$ is the first integration constant.\n\nTo find $K_1$, we apply the first boundary condition: zero flux at the center of the organoid due to symmetry, $\\frac{dC}{dr}\\big|_{r=0}=0$. Rearranging the equation above gives $\\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{qr}{3D} + \\frac{K_1}{r^2}$. For the flux to be zero (and finite) at $r=0$, the term $\\frac{K_1}{r^2}$ must not be singular. This requires that $K_1=0$. Therefore, the equation for the concentration gradient becomes:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r$$\n\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$:\n$$C(r) = \\int \\frac{q}{3D} r \\,dr = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + K_2$$\nwhere $K_2$ is the second integration constant.\n\nTo find $K_2$, we apply the second boundary condition: the oxygen concentration at the organoid surface ($r=R$) is fixed at $C_0$, i.e., $C(R)=C_0$.\n$$C(R) = C_0 = \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 + K_2$$\nSolving for $K_2$:\n$$K_2 = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2$$\n\nSubstituting $K_2$ back into the expression for $C(r)$ gives the complete oxygen concentration profile within the organoid:\n$$C(r) = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - r^2)$$\n\nThe critical radius, $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is defined as the radius at which the oxygen concentration at the center ($r=0$) just reaches the critical viability threshold, $C_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 0$. Setting $C(0)=0$ and $R=R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$C(0) = 0 = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} (R_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2 - 0^2)$$\n$$C_0 = \\frac{q R_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2}{6D}$$\n\nFinally, solving for the critical radius, $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2 = \\frac{6 D C_0}{q}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6 D C_0}{q}}$$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Critical Radius\n\nUsing the derived expression and the provided parameters:\n- $D = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $C_{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $q = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6 \\left(2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right) \\left(2.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\right)}{3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-9}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-3}}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sqrt{0.8 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2} = \\sqrt{80 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sqrt{80} \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 8.94427 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$).

To create larger, more physiologically complex organoids, this limitation must be overcome. Microphysiological models can employ several strategies:\n\n1.  **Introduction of Internal Perfusion**: This strategy involves engineering microfluidic channels within the organoid structure, creating a primitive vascular network. These channels are actively perfused with culture medium.\n    *   **Biophysical Principle**: This approach fundamentally changes the transport mechanism from being purely diffusive to being dominated by convection. Convection is a far more efficient mechanism for long-distance transport. The channels act as distributed sources of oxygen deep within the tissue, drastically reducing the effective diffusion distance for any given cell from the radius of the entire organoid to the much smaller distance to the nearest channel. This circumvents the limitations of the $R^2$ scaling inherent in the diffusion model, allowing the overall construct to grow much larger while ensuring that all cells remain viable.\n\n2.  **Use of Bioreactors with Enhanced External Mass Transport**: This strategy involves culturing organoids in a dynamic environment, such as a spinner flask or a perfusion bioreactor, where the medium flows around the organoid.\n    *   **Biophysical Principle**: In static culture, an unstirred boundary layer of depleted medium forms around the organoid surface. Oxygen must diffuse across this layer, meaning the concentration at the organoid surface, $C(R)$, is significantly lower than the concentration in the bulk medium, $C_0$. By introducing fluid flow, the bioreactor promotes advective mixing, which thins this boundary layer. A thinner boundary layer results in a smaller concentration drop, thereby increasing the effective oxygen concentration at the organoid's surface, bringing it closer to the bulk medium's $C_0$. As per the derived formula, $R_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\propto \\sqrt{C_0}$, so increasing the effective surface concentration allows for a larger viable radius.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{894.4}$$", "id": "5023801"}, {"introduction": "Microphysiological systems (MPS) offer precise control over the cellular microenvironment, a feature that is critical for mimicking physiological conditions such as blood flow.

Due to the assumptions, the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$. The $x$-momentum equation, a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equation, reduces to:\n$$\n\\frac{d p}{d x} = \\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $u$ is the velocity in the $x$-direction, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.
