This is a problem governed by the principle of mass conservation.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions of the variables and the governing equations. The fractional volume loss, which we will denote as $F_V$, is the ratio of the evaporated volume, $\\Delta V$, to the initial volume, $V_0$:\n$$F_V = \\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0}$$\n\nThe volume of liquid lost, $\\Delta V$, is related to the mass of liquid lost, $\\Delta m$, through the density of the liquid, $\\rho$:\n$$\\Delta V = \\frac{\\Delta m}{\\rho}$$\n\nThe problem states that the evaporation mass flux, $J_m$, is constant and uniform. The mass flux is defined as the mass lost per unit area per unit time. Therefore, the total mass lost, $\\Delta m$, from a surface of area $A$ over a time interval $t$ is given by:\n$$\\Delta m = J_m \\cdot A \\cdot t$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $\\Delta m$ into the equation for $\\Delta V$, and then substituting the result into the equation for $F_V$, we derive a single expression for the fractional volume loss in terms of the given quantities:\n$$F_V = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{J_m \\cdot A \\cdot t}{\\rho}\\right)}{V_0} = \\frac{J_m \\cdot A \\cdot t}{\\rho \\cdot V_0}$$\n\nThe next step is to ensure all given quantities are expressed in a consistent system of units.

Consider a 10-point serial dilution across 10 wells with a per-step $1:3$ dilution ratio, implemented by transferring a sample volume $V_{s}$ from well $i$ into well $i+1$, which has been preloaded with a diluent volume $V_{d}$ such that $V_{d} = 2 V_{s}$, yielding a total volume $V_{s} + V_{d} = 3 V_{s}$ in each dilution step. Assume the starting well ($i=1$) has negligible concentration variability. The liquid handler exhibits a constant coefficient of variation (CV) per pipetting transfer equal to $c = 0.05$, and all pipetting errors are independent across transfers and across wells. Each dilution step thus involves two independent transfers: one for $V_{s}$ and one for $V_{d}$.\n\nStarting from the definition of the coefficient of variation $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sigma/\\mu$, linearize the concentration update at each step under the small-error approximation and use independence to propagate uncertainty through the multiplicative sequence of dilution steps.

No percentage sign is permitted in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the concentration in the final well of a 10-well serial dilution. The process involves propagating the uncertainty from individual pipetting steps through the entire dilution series.\n\nFirst, we define the relationship between the concentration in successive wells. Let $C_i$ be the concentration in well $i$. To create the solution in well $i+1$, a sample volume $V_s$ is taken from well $i$ and mixed with a diluent volume $V_d$ in well $i+1$. The concentration in well $i+1$, denoted as $C_{i+1}$, is given by:\n$$ C_{i+1} = C_i \\frac{V_s}{V_s + V_d} $$\nHere, $V_s$ and $V_d$ are the actual (stochastic) volumes delivered, which fluctuate around their mean values. We can define a per-step dilution factor, $D_i$, for the step from well $i$ to well $i+1$:\n$$ D_i = \\frac{V_{s,i}}{V_{s,i} + V_{d,i}} $$\nwhere the index $i$ on the volumes indicates they are for the $i$-th dilution step. The concentration update is thus $C_{i+1} = C_i D_i$.\n\nThe serial dilution consists of 10 wells, starting from well 1 and ending at well 10. This constitutes $N=9$ dilution steps. The final concentration in well 10, $C_{10}$, is related to the starting concentration in well 1, $C_1$, by the product of the dilution factors for each step:\n$$ C_{10} = C_1 \\cdot D_1 \\cdot D_2 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot D_9 = C_1 \\prod_{i=1}^{9} D_i $$\nWe are asked to find the coefficient of variation of $C_{10}$, denoted $\\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}}$. The coefficient of variation of a random variable $X$ is defined as $\\mathrm{CV}_X = \\sigma_X / \\mu_X$, where $\\sigma_X$ is the standard deviation and $\\mu_X$ is the mean.\n\nFor a product of independent random variables, the squared coefficients of variation add. In our case, the variables are $C_1$ and the nine dilution factors $D_i$. The problem states that pipetting errors are independent across transfers and wells, which implies that all $D_i$ are independent of each other. Therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}}^2 = \\mathrm{CV}_{C_1}^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{9} \\mathrm{CV}_{D_i}^2 $$\nThe problem states that the starting well ($i=1$) has negligible concentration variability, so we can assume $\\mathrm{CV}_{C_1} \\approx 0$. Furthermore, because the liquid handler's performance is constant, all dilution steps are statistically identical. Thus, $\\mathrm{CV}_{D_i}$ is the same for all $i$. Let's call this common value $\\mathrm{CV}_D$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}}^2 = 9 \\cdot \\mathrm{CV}_D^2 $$\nTo find $\\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}}$, we must first calculate $\\mathrm{CV}_D$.\n\nLet's analyze a single dilution factor $D = \\frac{V_s}{V_s + V_d}$. We need to find its mean $\\mu_D$ and its variance $\\sigma_D^2$. The mean volumes are related by $\\mu_{V_d} = 2\\mu_{V_s}$, as given by $V_d = 2V_s$. The mean of the dilution factor, to a first-order approximation, is:\n$$ \\mu_D \\approx \\frac{\\mu_{V_s}}{\\mu_{V_s} + \\mu_{V_d}} = \\frac{\\mu_{V_s}}{\\mu_{V_s} + 2\\mu_{V_s}} = \\frac{\\mu_{V_s}}{3\\mu_{V_s}} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nTo find the variance $\\sigma_D^2$, we use the formula for propagation of uncertainty for independent variables $V_s$ and $V_d$. For a function $f(V_s, V_d)$, the variance is approximated by:\n$$ \\sigma_f^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V_s}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{V_s}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V_d}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{V_d}^2 $$\nThe required partial derivatives of $D(V_s, V_d) = \\frac{V_s}{V_s + V_d}$, evaluated at the mean values, are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial V_s} = \\frac{(V_s+V_d)(1) - V_s(1)}{(V_s+V_d)^2} = \\frac{V_d}{(V_s+V_d)^2} \\implies \\left.\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial V_s}\\right|_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\mu_{V_d}}{(\\mu_{V_s}+\\mu_{V_d})^2} = \\frac{2\\mu_{V_s}}{(3\\mu_{V_s})^2} = \\frac{2}{9\\mu_{V_s}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial V_d} = \\frac{(V_s+V_d)(0) - V_s(1)}{(V_s+V_d)^2} = \\frac{-V_s}{(V_s+V_d)^2} \\implies \\left.\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial V_d}\\right|_{\\mu} = \\frac{-\\mu_{V_s}}{(\\mu_{V_s}+\\mu_{V_d})^2} = \\frac{-\\mu_{V_s}}{(3\\mu_{V_s})^2} = \\frac{-1}{9\\mu_{V_s}} $$\nThe problem gives a constant CV per pipetting transfer, $c = 0.05$. This means $\\mathrm{CV}_{V_s} = \\sigma_{V_s}/\\mu_{V_s} = c$ and $\\mathrm{CV}_{V_d} = \\sigma_{V_d}/\\mu_{V_d} = c$. From these, we express the standard deviations in terms of means:\n$$ \\sigma_{V_s} = c \\mu_{V_s} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{V_d} = c \\mu_{V_d} = c (2\\mu_{V_s}) = 2c\\mu_{V_s} $$\nNow, we substitute the partial derivatives and standard deviations into the variance formula for $D$:\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{2}{9\\mu_{V_s}}\\right)^2 (c\\mu_{V_s})^2 + \\left(\\frac{-1}{9\\mu_{V_s}}\\right)^2 (2c\\mu_{V_s})^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 \\approx \\frac{4}{81\\mu_{V_s}^2} c^2\\mu_{V_s}^2 + \\frac{1}{81\\mu_{V_s}^2} 4c^2\\mu_{V_s}^2 $$\nThe $\\mu_{V_s}$ terms cancel, which is expected as the relative error should not depend on the absolute volume:\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 \\approx \\frac{4c^2}{81} + \\frac{4c^2}{81} = \\frac{8c^2}{81} $$\nNow we can compute the squared CV for the dilution factor:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_D^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_D^2}{\\mu_D^2} \\approx \\frac{8c^2/81}{(1/3)^2} = \\frac{8c^2/81}{1/9} = \\frac{8c^2}{9} $$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}}^2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}}^2 = 9 \\cdot \\mathrm{CV}_D^2 = 9 \\left(\\frac{8c^2}{9}\\right) = 8c^2 $$\nTaking the square root gives the coefficient of variation for the concentration in the 10th well:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}} = \\sqrt{8c^2} = c\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}c $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value $c = 0.05$:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}} = 2\\sqrt{2}(0.05) = \\sqrt{2}(0.1) $$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...$, we get:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}} \\approx 1.41421356 \\times 0.1 = 0.141421356 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{C_{10}} \\approx 0.1414 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1414}$$", "id": "5032468"}, {"introduction": "To determine if an assay is suitable for high-throughput screening, we need a universal metric that quantifies its quality by assessing the separation between control signals and their associated noise.
