The cumulative dwell time of the ribosome across this $30$-codon window is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{WT}} \\approx 10$ seconds.\nWe compare the available time for folding, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{WT}}$, with the required folding time, $\\tau_{f1}$:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{WT}} \\approx 10 \\text{ s} > \\tau_{f1} \\approx 7 \\text{ s} $$\nSince the time provided by the translational pause is greater than the characteristic time required for the domain to fold, there is a high probability that the first domain will fold correctly.

The time available for folding is insufficient for the first domain to reach its native state. This kinetic mismatch greatly reduces the probability of successful folding. The nascent chain is likely to misfold, as the emerging second domain will sterically hinder the folding of the first. According to the problem statement, misfolded chains are targeted for degradation by ribosome-associated quality control.\nThis implies that the probability of successful folding in the recoded case, $p_{f, \\text{recoded}}$, is significantly lower than in the WT case:\n$$ p_{f, \\text{recoded}}  p_{f, \\text{WT}} $$\n\n**Conclusion on Functional Yield ($Y$):**\nSince $Y \\propto p_f$ and $p_{f, \\text{recoded}}  p_{f, \\text{WT}}$, it follows that the functional protein yield will decrease:\n$$ Y_{\\text{recoded}}  Y_{\\text{WT}} $$\nThe effect on co-translational folding is that it is severely compromised or impaired by the removal of the programmed translational pause.

Functional protein yield increases and co-translational folding accelerates, because higher CAI increases $v(x)$ everywhere, reducing total synthesis time and thus hastening folding.**\nThis option incorrectly predicts an increase in functional yield. Its reasoning is flawed: while higher CAI does increase the rate of synthesis ($v(x)$), this does not \"hasten folding\". Instead, it reduces the time available for folding, which, as shown above, compromises the process and leads to misfolding. Therefore, this option is mechanistically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Functional protein yield increases but co-translational folding slows, because higher CAI increases throughput, and folding slows as less time is available near the domain boundary.**\nThis option also incorrectly predicts an increase in functional yield. While it correctly identifies that there is \"less time available\" for folding, it fails to connect this to the logical consequence of reduced yield due to misfolding and degradation. The claim of increased yield is a common but naive assumption associated with codon optimization that ignores the complexities of co-translational folding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Functional protein yield decreases and co-translational folding is compromised, because removing the low-CAI boundary pause reduces $\\Delta t$ below $\\tau_{f1}$, decreasing $p_f$ and increasing degradation of misfolded chains despite unchanged $k_i$.**\nThis option correctly predicts that the functional protein yield decreases. It also correctly identifies that co-translational folding is compromised. The justification provided is entirely consistent with our derivation. It correctly compares the available time ($\\Delta t$) with the required time ($\\tau_{f1}$), links this to a decrease in the folding probability ($p_f$), understands that misfolded products are degraded, and correctly concludes that yield ($Y \\propto k_i \\cdot p_f$) must decrease since $k_i$ is constant. This option provides a complete and accurate mechanistic explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Functional protein yield is unchanged and co-translational folding improves, because uniform high CAI reduces ribosome queuing and collisions, allowing chaperones to fold domains more efficiently irrespective of boundary pauses.**\nThis option makes multiple incorrect claims. The functional yield is not unchanged; it decreases. Co-translational folding does not improve; it is compromised. While uniform high CAI might reduce ribosome queuing in some contexts, the option's claim that folding improves \"irrespective of boundary pauses\" directly contradicts the central premise of the problem, which is the kinetic competition between elongation and folding defined by the comparison of $\\Delta t$ and $\\tau_{f1}$.
