It is a valid and standard problem in quantitative biology. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the exon inclusion probability, $p$. We are given that each read is an independent Bernoulli trial. An \"inclusion\" read is a success with probability $p$, and a \"skipping\" read is a failure with probability $1-p$.\n\nLet $I$ be the number of inclusion reads (successes) and $S$ be the number of skipping reads (failures). The total number of trials is $N = I + S$. The number of successes, $I$, in a fixed number of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials follows a binomial distribution, $I \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$.\n\nThe probability mass function for observing $I$ successes in $N$ trials is given by:\n$$ P(I | N, p) = \\binom{N}{I} p^I (1-p)^{N-I} $$\nThis function, when viewed as a function of the parameter $p$ for the observed data $I$ and $N$, is the likelihood function, $L(p | I, N)$:\n$$ L(p) = \\binom{N}{I} p^I (1-p)^{N-I} $$\nTo find the MLE for $p$, we must find the value of $p$ that maximizes $L(p)$. It is mathematically more convenient to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood $\\ell(p)$, since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function. Maximizing $\\ell(p)$ is equivalent to maximizing $L(p)$.\n$$ \\ell(p) = \\ln(L(p)) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{N}{I} p^I (1-p)^{N-I}\\right) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$ \\ell(p) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{N}{I}\\right) + I \\ln(p) + (N-I) \\ln(1-p) $$\nTo find the maximum, we take the first derivative of $\\ell(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set it to zero. The term $\\ln\\left(\\binom{N}{I}\\right)$ is a constant with respect to $p$, so its derivative is zero.\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left[ I \\ln(p) + (N-I) \\ln(1-p) \\right] = \\frac{I}{p} - \\frac{N-I}{1-p} $$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point, which we denote $\\hat{p}$:\n$$ \\frac{I}{\\hat{p}} - \\frac{N-I}{1-\\hat{p}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{I}{\\hat{p}} = \\frac{N-I}{1-\\hat{p}} $$\n$$ I(1-\\hat{p}) = \\hat{p}(N-I) $$\n$$ I - I\\hat{p} = N\\hat{p} - I\\hat{p} $$\n$$ I = N\\hat{p} $$\nSolving for $\\hat{p}$ gives the maximum likelihood estimator:\n$$ \\hat{p}_{MLE} = \\frac{I}{N} $$\nTo confirm that this is a maximum, we can examine the second derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} = -\\frac{I}{p^2} - \\frac{N-I}{(1-p)^2} $$\nSince $I$ (number of inclusion reads) and $N-I=S$ (number of skipping reads) are non-negative counts, and we can assume $0  p  1$ for a non-trivial case, both terms in the second derivative are negative. Thus, $\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2}  0$, which confirms that the log-likelihood function is concave and $\\hat{p}_{MLE}$ is indeed a maximum.\n\nThe Percent Spliced In (PSI) is defined as a probabilistic measure of exon inclusion. The MLE provides the most probable value for this underlying probability given the data. Therefore, we identify PSI with the MLE:\n$$ \\text{PSI} \\equiv \\hat{p}_{MLE} = \\frac{I}{N} = \\frac{I}{I+S} $$\n\nNow, we compute the PSI for the given sample data:\n- Number of inclusion reads, $I = 80$.\n- Number of skipping reads, $S = 20$.\n\nThe total number of relevant reads is $N = I + S = 80 + 20 = 100$.\nThe PSI value is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{PSI} = \\frac{I}{N} = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.8 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a unitless decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{PSI} = 0.8000 $$\n\n### Biological Interpretation\n\nIn the context of translational medicine, a PSI value of $0.8000$ for a cassette exon in a clinically actionable gene is a highly significant quantitative finding. It indicates that in the analyzed tumor sample, $80\\%$ of the mRNA transcripts produced from this gene include the specific exon, while only $20\\%$ of the transcripts skip it. This differential isoform usage can have direct clinical consequences. For instance, if the protein product of the inclusion isoform drives oncogenesis or confers resistance to a targeted therapy, this high PSI value would suggest a poor prognosis or predict non-response to that specific treatment. Conversely, if the inclusion isoform is required for a normal cellular function that is lost in the disease, this value might be compared against a baseline from healthy tissue to quantify the extent of dysregulation. Thus, PSI serves as a quantitative molecular biomarker that can inform diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategy by linking a fundamental molecular process—alternative splicing—to a patient's specific disease state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "5037042"}, {"introduction": "In high-throughput proteomics, distinguishing true peptide identifications from random spectral matches is a critical statistical challenge.

From the problem statement, we have:\n$$N_T = 10{,}000$$\n$$N_D = 200$$\n\nThe total number of PSMs above the threshold is $N_T + N_D = 10{,}000 + 200 = 10{,}200$, which is consistent with the provided total.\n\n**1. Derive the False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimate.**\n\nThe set of \"accepted discoveries\" for reporting in a proteomics experiment consists of the target PSMs only. The decoy PSMs are a statistical tool used to estimate the number of errors and are not considered discoveries themselves. Therefore, the total number of accepted discoveries, $R$, is equal to the number of accepted target PSMs.\n$$R = N_T = 10{,}000$$\n\nThe FDR is defined as $\\mathrm{FDR} = \\mathbb{E}[V/R]$, where $V$ is the number of false discoveries (i.e., incorrect target PSMs) and $R$ is the total number of accepted discoveries. Since the analysis is performed at a fixed score threshold, the number of accepted discoveries $R$ is a fixed quantity, $R = N_T$. The definition of FDR thus simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{FDR} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[V]}{R} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[V]}{N_T}$$\n\nThe problem states as a foundational principle that the number of accepted decoy PSMs, $N_D$, serves as an unbiased estimator for the number of incorrect target PSMs, $V$. This means that the expected value of $V$, $\\mathbb{E}[V]$, can be estimated by the observed value of $N_D$.\n$$\\widehat{\\mathbb{E}[V]} = N_D = 200$$\n\nAn estimator for the FDR, denoted $\\widehat{\\text{FDR}}$, can now be constructed by substituting the observed quantities into the FDR formula:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{FDR}} = \\frac{N_D}{N_T}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{FDR}} = \\frac{200}{10{,}000} = 0.02$$\n\n**2. Determine if the identification set satisfies the project requirement.**\n\nThe project requirement is that the identifications have a $q$-value less than or equal to $0.02$. The problem defines the $q$-value of a discovery as the minimum FDR at which that discovery would be accepted. For a set of identifications passing a certain score threshold, the $\\widehat{\\text{FDR}}$ calculated for the entire set is the estimated $q$-value of the lowest-scoring identification in that set. All other identifications in the set, having higher scores, will have $q$-values less than or equal to this value.\n\nThus, the condition that all accepted PSMs have $q \\le 0.02$ is equivalent to the condition that the FDR of the entire set is less than or equal to $0.02$.\nWe must check if $\\widehat{\\text{FDR}} \\le 0.02$.\nOur calculated value is $\\widehat{\\text{FDR}} = 0.02$. The inequality $0.02 \\le 0.02$ is true. Therefore, the identification set satisfies the project requirement.\n\n**3. Compute the expected number of true peptide identifications.**\n\nThis computation is conditional on the set satisfying the project requirement, which it does.\nThe set of accepted target PSMs, of size $N_T$, is a mixture of true identifications (True Positives, or TP) and false identifications (False Positives, or FP).\n$$N_T = \\text{TP} + \\text{FP}$$\n\nThe number of false positives, FP, is precisely the quantity we have previously denoted as $V$, the number of false discoveries. We seek the expected number of true identifications, $\\mathbb{E}[\\text{TP}]$.\nFrom the above relation, we have $\\text{TP} = N_T - \\text{FP}$. Taking the expectation, and noting that $N_T$ is a fixed number:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\text{TP}] = N_T - \\mathbb{E}[\\text{FP}]$$\nAs established in step 1, the expected number of false positives, $\\mathbb{E}[\\text{FP}] = \\mathbb{E}[V]$, is estimated by the number of decoy hits, $N_D$.\n$$\\widehat{\\mathbb{E}[\\text{FP}]} = N_D = 200$$\nWe can now compute the expected number of true identifications by substituting the known and estimated values:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\text{TP}] \\approx N_T - N_D = 10{,}000 - 200 = 9{,}800$$\nThis result is an exact integer, as required by the problem's rounding instructions.
