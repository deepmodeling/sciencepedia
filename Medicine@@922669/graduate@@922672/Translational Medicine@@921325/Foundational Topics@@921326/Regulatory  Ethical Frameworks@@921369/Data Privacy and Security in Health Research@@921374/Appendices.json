Current $k$ for the Dataset**\n\nThe principle of $k$-anonymity mandates that every equivalence class in a dataset must contain at least $k$ records. Consequently, the value of $k$ for a given dataset is determined by the size of the smallest equivalence class.\nThe initial set of equivalence class sizes is given as $\\{2, 3, 5, 8\\}$.\nThe minimum size in this set is $2$.\nTherefore, the dataset currently satisfies $2$-anonymity. The current value of $k$ is $2$.\n\n**2. Optimal Strategy for $k=5$-Anonymity**\n\nThe target is to achieve $k=5$-anonymity. This means every equivalence class in the final dataset must have a size of at least $5$. The initial class sizes are $\\{2, 3, 5, 8\\}$.\nThe classes of size $5$ and $8$ already satisfy the condition. The classes of size $2$ and $3$ do not. Let us denote these classes as $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_5$, and $C_8$. Our task is to modify the dataset such that all final classes containing records from the original $C_2$ and $C_3$ are of size at least $5$. This must be done while minimizing the information loss functional $L$:\n$$\nL = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{N_{gen}}{18} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{N_{sup}}{18}\n$$\nwhere $N_{gen}$ is the number of generalized records and $N_{sup}$ is the number of suppressed records. The total number of records is $N = 18$. The per-record cost of generalization is $\\frac{\\alpha}{N} = \\frac{2/5}{18} = \\frac{2}{90} = \\frac{1}{45}$. The per-record cost of suppression is $\\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{1}{18}$. Since $\\frac{1}{45} < \\frac{1}{18}$, generalization is a less costly operation per affected record than suppression.\n\nTo achieve compliance, we must address the $2+3=5$ records belonging to the non-compliant classes $C_2$ and $C_3$. We analyze the feasible strategies.\n\n**Strategy 1: Suppression Only**\nTo resolve the non-compliant classes $C_2$ and $C_3$ using only suppression, we must remove all records within them.\n- Suppress the $2$ records in $C_2$.\n- Suppress the $3$ records in $C_3$.\nThe number of suppressed records is $N_{sup} = 2+3=5$. The number of generalized records is $N_{gen} = 0$. The remaining classes are $C_5$ and $C_8$, which are compliant.\nThe loss is:\n$$\nL_1 = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{0}{18} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{5}{18}\n$$\n\n**Strategy 2: Generalization Only**\nWe can use generalization to merge non-compliant classes to form a new, compliant class.\nA) **Merge non-compliant classes with each other**: We merge $C_2$ and $C_3$.\n- The new class has size $2+3=5$. This new class is compliant, as its size is $\\ge 5$.\n- The set of equivalence classes becomes $\\{5, 5, 8\\}$. All classes are compliant.\n- The records that were generalized are those in the original $C_2$ and $C_3$. So, $N_{gen} = 2+3=5$. The number of suppressed records is $N_{sup}=0$.\n- The loss is:\n$$\nL_2 = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{18} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{0}{18} = \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n\nB) **Merge non-compliant classes with compliant ones**: This would involve the records in $C_5$ or $C_8$, increasing the number of generalized records. For example, if we merge $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_5$:\n- The new class has size $2+3+5=10$. The remaining class is $C_8$. The set of classes is $\\{10, 8\\}$, which is compliant.\n- The number of generalized records is $N_{gen} = 2+3+5=10$. $N_{sup}=0$.\n- The loss is:\n$$\nL_3 = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{10}{18} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{0}{18} = \\frac{4}{18} = \\frac{2}{9}\n$$\n\n**Strategy 3: Mixed Strategy**\nWe could mix suppression and generalization. For instance, to deal with $C_2$ and $C_3$, we could suppress one class and generalize the other with a compliant class. For example, suppress $C_2$ and merge $C_3$ with $C_5$.\n- Suppress the $2$ records in $C_2$. So $N_{sup}=2$.\n- Merge $C_3$ and $C_5$. This forms a new class of size $3+5=8$. These records are generalized, so $N_{gen}=8$.\n- The final classes are $\\{8, 8\\}$. This is compliant.\n- The loss is:\n$$\nL_4 = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{18} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{16/5}{18} + \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{16/5 + 10/5}{18} = \\frac{26/5}{18} = \\frac{26}{90} = \\frac{13}{45}\n$$\n\n**Comparison and Argument for Minimality**\nLet's compare the losses calculated:\n- $L_1 = \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{25}{90}$\n- $L_2 = \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{10}{90}$\n- $L_3 = \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{20}{90}$\n- $L_4 = \\frac{13}{45} = \\frac{26}{90}$\n\nThe minimum loss among these strategies is $L_2 = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nTo argue for its minimality from first principles, we observe the following:\n1.  There are exactly $5$ records (in $C_2$ and $C_3$) that are in non-compliant classes. These $5$ records are the minimum set of records that must be altered (either generalized or suppressed).\n2.  The per-record cost of suppression ($\\frac{1}{18}$) is greater than the per-record cost of generalization ($\\frac{1}{45}$). Therefore, an optimal strategy should prioritize generalization over suppression for any record that must be altered.\n3.  The sum of the sizes of the non-compliant classes is $2+3=5$. This sum matches the target $k$-anonymity level $k=5$ exactly. This allows for a strategy that addresses all non-compliant records through a single merge operation, resulting in a new class of size $5$, which is compliant. This strategy is **Strategy 2A**: merge $C_2$ and $C_3$.\n4.  This strategy alters the minimum necessary number of records ($5$) using the cheapest possible alteration method (generalization). Any other strategy is suboptimal for one of the following reasons:\n    - It uses suppression, which is more costly per record (e.g., $L_1, L_4$).\n    - It involves records from the already-compliant classes ($C_5, C_8$) in a generalization, needlessly increasing $N_{gen}$ and thus the total loss (e.g., $L_3$).\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to merge the equivalence class of size $2$ with the equivalence class of size $3$. This creates a new equivalence class of size $5$. The final set of equivalence classes will have sizes $\\{5, 5, 8\\}$, which fully satisfies $5$-anonymity.\n\n**3. Minimal Value of $L$**\n\nAs determined above, the optimal strategy is to merge the classes of size $2$ and $3$. This involves generalizing $5$ records and suppressing $0$ records. The minimal information loss $L_{min}$ is:\n$$\nL_{min} = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{18} + \\frac{0}{18} = \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\nThe value is required as a single exact fraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$$", "id": "5004244"}, {"introduction": "While $k$-anonymity prevents identity disclosure, it can be vulnerable to attribute disclosure if all individuals in an equivalence class share the same sensitive attribute.

The specific criterion is distinct $l=3$-diversity.\n\nFirst, we must validate the initial state of the dataset. The dataset is partitioned into five equivalence classes, denoted $E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4,$ and $E_5$. Each class has a size of $10$, which is consistent with the stated $k$-anonymity of $k=10$. The sensitive attribute is \"HIV diagnosis,\" which can take one of four values: Positive ($P$), Negative ($N$), Unknown ($U$), or Inconclusive ($I$).\n\nThe distinct $l$-diversity criterion, as defined in the problem, requires that an equivalence class contains at least $l$ distinct sensitive values with a frequency strictly greater than zero. For this problem, we must satisfy $l=3$-diversity. Let $S(E_i)$ be the set of sensitive values present in an equivalence class $E_i$. The condition for compliance is $|S(E_i)| \\geq 3$. We will now assess each of the five equivalence classes.\n\nFor equivalence class $E_1$:\nThe counts are $P=4, N=6, U=0, I=0$.\nThe set of sensitive values with non-zero frequency is $S(E_1) = \\{P, N\\}$.\nThe number of distinct sensitive values is $|S(E_1)| = 2$.\nSince $2 < 3$, class $E_1$ does not satisfy distinct $l=3$-diversity.\n\nFor equivalence class $E_2$:\nThe counts are $P=3, N=4, U=2, I=1$.\nThe set of sensitive values with non-zero frequency is $S(E_2) = \\{P, N, U, I\\}$.\nThe number of distinct sensitive values is $|S(E_2)| = 4$.\nSince $4 \\geq 3$, class $E_2$ satisfies distinct $l=3$-diversity.\n\nFor equivalence class $E_3$:\nThe counts are $P=0, N=9, U=1, I=0$.\nThe set of sensitive values with non-zero frequency is $S(E_3) = \\{N, U\\}$.\nThe number of distinct sensitive values is $|S(E_3)| = 2$.\nSince $2 < 3$, class $E_3$ does not satisfy distinct $l=3$-diversity.\n\nFor equivalence class $E_4$:\nThe counts are $P=2, N=7, U=1, I=0$.\nThe set of sensitive values with non-zero frequency is $S(E_4) = \\{P, N, U\\}$.\nThe number of distinct sensitive values is $|S(E_4)| = 3$.\nSince $3 \\geq 3$, class $E_4$ satisfies distinct $l=3$-diversity.\n\nFor equivalence class $E_5$:\nThe counts are $P=1, N=6, U=3, I=0$.\nThe set of sensitive values with non-zero frequency is $S(E_5) = \\{P, N, U\\}$.\nThe number of distinct sensitive values is $|S(E_5)| = 3$.\nSince $3 \\geq 3$, class $E_5$ satisfies distinct $l=3$-diversity.\n\nIn summary, equivalence classes $E_1$ and $E_3$ are non-compliant, while $E_2, E_4,$ and $E_5$ are compliant. To make the entire dataset compliant, we must perform remediation on $E_1$ and $E_3$ by merging them with other classes. The objective is to achieve this with the minimal number of pairwise merges.\n\nA merge operation combines two equivalence classes, say $E_i$ and $E_j$, into a new class $E_{ij}$. The set of sensitive values in the new class is the union of the original sets, $S(E_i) \\cup S(E_j)$. The size of the new class is the sum of the original sizes. The problem states that any resulting equivalence class must maintain $k \\geq 10$. Since each initial class has size $10$, any merge will result in a class of size $20$ or greater, thus automatically satisfying the $k \\geq 10$ constraint.\n\nWe have two non-compliant classes, $E_1$ and $E_3$. To fix them, we must perform at least one merge operation. If we could resolve both non-compliant classes with a single merge, this would be the minimal number. Let us consider merging the two non-compliant classes, $E_1$ and $E_3$.\n\nLet the new class be $E_{13} = E_1 \\cup E_3$.\nThe set of sensitive values for this new class is $S(E_{13}) = S(E_1) \\cup S(E_3)$.\nFrom our initial analysis, $S(E_1) = \\{P, N\\}$ and $S(E_3) = \\{N, U\\}$.\nTherefore, $S(E_{13}) = \\{P, N\\} \\cup \\{N, U\\} = \\{P, N, U\\}$.\nThe number of distinct sensitive values in the merged class is $|S(E_{13})| = 3$.\nSince $|S(E_{13})| = 3$, the new class $E_{13}$ satisfies distinct $l=3$-diversity.\n\nThis single merge operation results in a new set of equivalence classes for the dataset: $\\{E_{13}, E_2, E_4, E_5\\}$. We have already established that $E_2, E_4,$ and $E_5$ are compliant. The new class $E_{13}$ is also compliant. Thus, the entire dataset is now compliant.\n\nThis was achieved with one pairwise merge. Since the initial dataset was non-compliant, the number of required merges must be at least one. As we have found a solution with exactly one merge, this is the minimal number.\n\nAlternative strategies, such as merging a non-compliant class with a compliant one (e.g., merging $E_1$ with $E_2$), would fix $E_1$ but still leave $E_3$ as non-compliant, necessitating a second merge for $E_3$. This would result in a total of two merges, which is not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of pairwise merges required is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "5004351"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond heuristic-based models like $k$-anonymity, differential privacy offers a provable, mathematical guarantee of privacy.
