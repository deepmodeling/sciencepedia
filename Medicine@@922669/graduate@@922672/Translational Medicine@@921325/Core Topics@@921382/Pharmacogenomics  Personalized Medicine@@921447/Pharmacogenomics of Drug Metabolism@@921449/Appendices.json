It is scientifically grounded in population genetics and pharmacogenomics, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a randomly selected individual from a population is a CYP2C19 poor metabolizer. This translates to finding the frequency of genotypes that confer this phenotype.\n\nThe problem states there are three alleles at the CYP2C19 locus: a wild-type allele, which we denote as $*1$, and two loss-of-function (LoF) alleles, $*2$ and $*3$. Let their respective allele frequencies be $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$.\nThe given frequencies for the LoF alleles are:\n$$f(*2) = p_2 = 0.15$$\n$$f(*3) = p_3 = 0.05$$\n\nThe problem states that the wild-type allele $*1$ accounts for all remaining alleles. Therefore, the sum of all allele frequencies must equal $1$:\n$$p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$$\nWe can calculate the frequency of the wild-type allele, $p_1$:\n$$p_1 = 1 - p_2 - p_3 = 1 - 0.15 - 0.05 = 0.80$$\n\nA poor metabolizer is defined as an individual having two loss-of-function alleles. At this tri-allelic locus, the possible genotypes consist of combinations of two alleles. The genotypes corresponding to the poor metabolizer phenotype are those composed exclusively of the LoF alleles, $*2$ and $*3$. These genotypes are:\n1. Homozygous for $*2$: genotype $*2/*2$.\n2. Homozygous for $*3$: genotype $*3/*3$.\n3. Compound heterozygous with one $*2$ and one $*3$ allele: genotype $*2/*3$.\n\nThe problem states that the population is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). For a multi-allelic locus, the genotype frequencies are determined by the expansion of the squared sum of the allele frequencies. For three alleles, this is $(p_1 + p_2 + p_3)^2$. The frequencies of the specific genotypes are:\n- Frequency of $*2/*2$ is $p_2^2$.\n- Frequency of $*3/*3$ is $p_3^2$.\n- Frequency of $*2/*3$ is $2 p_2 p_3$.\n\nThe total probability of being a poor metabolizer, denoted as $P(\\text{PM})$, is the sum of the frequencies of these three genotypes:\n$$P(\\text{PM}) = f(*2/*2) + f(*3/*3) + f(*2/*3)$$\nSubstituting the HWE proportions:\n$$P(\\text{PM}) = p_2^2 + p_3^2 + 2 p_2 p_3$$\nThis expression is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as:\n$$P(\\text{PM}) = (p_2 + p_3)^2$$\n\nThis result has a clear biological interpretation. We can conceptually pool all loss-of-function alleles into a single category, \"LoF\". The total frequency of this \"LoF\" allele category, let's call it $p_{\\text{LoF}}$, is the sum of the frequencies of the individual LoF alleles:\n$$p_{\\text{LoF}} = p_2 + p_3$$\nAn individual is a poor metabolizer if they inherit two alleles from this \"LoF\" category. Under random mating (the cornerstone of HWE), the probability of this event is simply the square of the total \"LoF\" allele frequency:\n$$P(\\text{PM}) = (p_{\\text{LoF}})^2 = (p_2 + p_3)^2$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$p_{\\text{LoF}} = 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.20$$\n$$P(\\text{PM}) = (0.20)^2 = 0.04$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in scientific notation with three significant figures.\n$$0.04 = 4.00 \\times 10^{-2}$$\nThe trailing zeros in $4.00$ are included to satisfy the requirement of three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "5041979"}, {"introduction": "The core task in pharmacogenomics is to connect a specific genotype to a measurable change in drug disposition.

The givens are: a constant infusion rate $R_{\\text{in}}$; two cohorts, a reference (cohort $0$) and a variant (cohort $v$); reference clearance $CL_{0}$; a $75\\%$ reduction in DPD-mediated clearance for cohort $v$; and key assumptions including linear elimination, attainment of steady state, and total clearance being equivalent to DPD-mediated clearance. The problem is scientifically grounded in established pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic principles, is well-posed with sufficient information to derive a unique solution, and is stated in objective, formal language. The premises are consistent and the scenario, while simplified, is plausible. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nThe primary principle governing drug concentration during a continuous intravenous infusion is the balance between the rate of drug administration and the rate of drug elimination. The rate of administration is the constant infusion rate, $R_{\\text{in}}$. For a drug exhibiting linear (first-order) elimination, the rate of elimination is proportional to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$, and is given by the product of the total systemic clearance, $CL$, and the concentration: $CL \\times C(t)$.\n\nAt steady state, the concentration becomes constant, denoted as $C_{\\text{ss}}$. By definition, this state is achieved when the rate of administration equals the rate of elimination.\n$$R_{\\text{in}} = CL \\times C_{\\text{ss}}$$\nFrom this fundamental relationship, the steady-state concentration can be expressed as:\n$$C_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL}$$\nThis equation shows that for a constant infusion rate, the steady-state concentration is inversely proportional to the drug's clearance.\n\nThe problem asks for the Area Under the Curve ($AUC$) over a time window $\\Delta t$, defined as $AUC = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} C(t)\\, dt$. Since the system is assumed to be at a constant steady state throughout this observation window, the concentration $C(t)$ is equal to $C_{\\text{ss}}$ for all $t$ in the interval $[0, \\Delta t]$. The integral simplifies to:\n$$AUC = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} C_{\\text{ss}} \\, dt = C_{\\text{ss}} \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} dt = C_{\\text{ss}} \\times \\Delta t$$\nNow, we apply these principles to the two patient cohorts.\n\nFor cohort $0$ (reference), the clearance is $CL_{0}$. The steady-state concentration, $C_{\\text{ss},0}$, is:\n$$C_{\\text{ss},0} = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL_{0}}$$\nThe corresponding $AUC$ for cohort $0$, denoted $AUC_{0}$, is:\n$$AUC_{0} = C_{\\text{ss},0} \\times \\Delta t = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL_{0}} \\times \\Delta t$$\n\nFor cohort $v$ (variant), the problem states that DPD-mediated clearance is reduced by $75\\%$. It is also assumed that non-DPD elimination is negligible, so total clearance is identical to DPD-mediated clearance. Let the clearance for cohort $v$ be $CL_{v}$. A $75\\%$ reduction from the reference clearance $CL_{0}$ means:\n$$CL_{v} = CL_{0} - (0.75 \\times CL_{0}) = (1 - 0.75) \\times CL_{0} = 0.25 \\times CL_{0}$$\nThe steady-state concentration for cohort $v$, $C_{\\text{ss},v}$, is calculated using its clearance, $CL_{v}$, and the same infusion rate $R_{\\text{in}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{ss},v} = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL_{v}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{0.25 \\times CL_{0}}$$\nThe corresponding $AUC$ for cohort $v$, denoted $AUC_{v}$, over the same time window $\\Delta t$ is:\n$$AUC_{v} = C_{\\text{ss},v} \\times \\Delta t = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{0.25 \\times CL_{0}} \\times \\Delta t$$\n\nThe objective is to compute the multiplicative factor by which the $AUC$ in cohort $v$ increases compared to cohort $0$. This is the ratio $\\frac{AUC_{v}}{AUC_{0}}$.\n$$\\frac{AUC_{v}}{AUC_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{0.25 \\times CL_{0}} \\times \\Delta t}{\\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL_{0}} \\times \\Delta t}$$\nThe terms $R_{\\text{in}}$ and $\\Delta t$ are identical for both cohorts and cancel out from the numerator and denominator. The clearance term $CL_{0}$ also cancels.\n$$\\frac{AUC_{v}}{AUC_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{0.25}}{1} = \\frac{1}{0.25}$$\nCalculating the final value:\n$$\\frac{1}{0.25} = \\frac{1}{1/4} = 4$$\nThus, the steady-state $5$-FU $AUC$ in cohort $v$ is $4$ times the $AUC$ in cohort $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "5041966"}, {"introduction": "While simple models are instructive, real-world pharmacokinetics are governed by organ-level physiology.
