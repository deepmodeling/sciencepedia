Hepatic clearance ($CL_H$) is not a monolithic process; it is a sequence of events, primarily active uptake into the hepatocyte followed by intracellular metabolism. This exercise uses the well-stirred liver model to explore this relationship, allowing you to calculate how a genetically-driven reduction in intrinsic uptake clearance ($CL_{\\text{int,uptake}}$) affects the overall hepatic clearance, illustrating the crucial role transporters can play as a rate-limiting step in drug disposition [@problem_id:4572266].", "problem": "A transporter-limited hepatic clearance scenario is considered for a highly protein-bound anionic drug whose hepatic uptake is predominantly mediated by Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), encoded by solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1). Assume linear pharmacokinetics, negligible passive diffusion relative to active uptake, negligible basolateral efflux back to blood, and that intracellular metabolism is the sole irreversible elimination pathway. The unbound drug in blood is the driving force for hepatocellular processes, and the liver behaves according to the well-stirred assumption of instantaneous mixing.\n\nStarting from first principles (mass balance and definitions of hepatic extraction and clearance under the well-stirred assumption), treat basolateral uptake and intracellular metabolism as sequential first-order processes within the hepatocyte and derive an expression for hepatic clearance $CL_{H}$ as a function of hepatic blood flow $Q_{H}$, blood fraction unbound $f_{u,b}$, intrinsic uptake clearance $CL_{\\text{int,uptake}}$, and intrinsic metabolic clearance $CL_{\\text{int,met}}$. Then, using the derived expression, compute $CL_{H}$ for the baseline scenario with $Q_{H}=90$ L/h, $f_{u,b}=0.05$, $CL_{\\text{int,uptake}}=200$ L/h, and $CL_{\\text{int,met}}=50$ L/h.

It describes a standard pharmacokinetic scenario based on the well-stirred model of hepatic clearance, extended to include transporter-mediated uptake. The provided data are complete and consistent for solving the problem as stated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the derivation of the general expression for hepatic clearance ($CL_H$) under the given assumptions, and second, the numerical computation of $CL_H$ for the two specified scenarios.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Hepatic Clearance Expression**\n\nWe begin from the first principles of the well-stirred model of hepatic clearance. At steady state, the rate of drug elimination by the liver is equal to the rate of drug entry minus the rate of drug exit via the hepatic blood flow, $Q_H$.\nLet $C_{in}$ be the drug concentration in the blood entering the liver and $C_{out}$ be the drug concentration in the blood leaving the liver.\nThe rate of elimination is $Q_H (C_{in} - C_{out})$.\nHepatic clearance, $CL_H$, is defined as the rate of elimination divided by the entering drug concentration:\n$$ CL_H = \\frac{Q_H (C_{in} - C_{out})}{C_{in}} $$\nThe well-stirred model assumes that the sinusoidal blood concentration is uniform and equal to the exiting concentration, $C_{out}$. It also posits that the rate of elimination is proportional to the unbound drug concentration in this sinusoidal blood, $C_{u,out}$, and the liver's overall intrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int}}$. The unbound concentration is $C_{u,out} = f_{u,b} C_{out}$, where $f_{u,b}$ is the fraction unbound in blood.\nTherefore, the rate of elimination can also be expressed as:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL_{\\text{int}} \\cdot C_{u,out} = CL_{\\text{int}} \\cdot f_{u,b} \\cdot C_{out} $$\nBy equating the two expressions for the rate of elimination, we get:\n$$ Q_H (C_{in} - C_{out}) = CL_{\\text{int}} \\cdot f_{u,b} \\cdot C_{out} $$\nTo find an expression for $CL_H$, we first solve for the ratio $C_{out}/C_{in}$:\n$$ Q_H C_{in} = (Q_H + f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}) C_{out} $$\n$$ \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = \\frac{Q_H}{Q_H + f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}} $$\nThe hepatic extraction ratio, $E_H$, is $E_H = (C_{in} - C_{out})/C_{in} = 1 - C_{out}/C_{in}$.\n$$ E_H = 1 - \\frac{Q_H}{Q_H + f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}} = \\frac{(Q_H + f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}) - Q_H}{Q_H + f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}} = \\frac{f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}}{Q_H + f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}} $$\nHepatic clearance is $CL_H = Q_H \\cdot E_H$. Substituting the expression for $E_H$ gives the standard well-stirred model equation:\n$$ CL_H = Q_H \\frac{f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}}{Q_H + f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}} $$\nThe problem states that hepatic elimination involves two sequential first-order processes: basolateral uptake and intracellular metabolism. This means that the overall intrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int}}$, is a composite of the intrinsic uptake clearance, $CL_{\\text{int,uptake}}$, and the intrinsic metabolic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int,met}}$. For processes in series, their resistances add. Since clearance is the reciprocal of resistance, the reciprocals of the clearances add:\n$$ \\frac{1}{CL_{\\text{int}}} = \\frac{1}{CL_{\\text{int,uptake}}} + \\frac{1}{CL_{\\text{int,met}}} $$\nSolving for $CL_{\\text{int}}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{CL_{\\text{int}}} = \\frac{CL_{\\text{int,met}} + CL_{\\text{int,uptake}}}{CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} \\cdot CL_{\\text{int,met}}} $$\n$$ CL_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} \\cdot CL_{\\text{int,met}}}{CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} + CL_{\\text{int,met}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $CL_{\\text{int}}$ into the well-stirred model equation yields the final derived expression for hepatic clearance as a function of all given parameters:\n$$ CL_{H} = Q_{H} \\frac{f_{u,b} \\left( \\frac{CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} \\cdot CL_{\\text{int,met}}}{CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} + CL_{\\text{int,met}}} \\right)}{Q_{H} + f_{u,b} \\left( \\frac{CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} \\cdot CL_{\\text{int,met}}}{CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} + CL_{\\text{int,met}}} \\right)} $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computations**\n\n**Scenario 1: Baseline**\nThe given parameters are:\n$Q_{H} = 90$ L/h\n$f_{u,b} = 0.05$\n$CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} = 200$ L/h\n$CL_{\\text{int,met}} = 50$ L/h\n\nFirst, we compute the overall intrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int}}$:\n$$ CL_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{200 \\times 50}{200 + 50} = \\frac{10000}{250} = 40 \\text{ L/h} $$\nNext, we compute the hepatic clearance, $CL_H$:\nThe term $f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}$ is $0.05 \\times 40 = 2$ L/h.\n$$ CL_{H, \\text{baseline}} = 90 \\times \\frac{2}{90 + 2} = 90 \\times \\frac{2}{92} = \\frac{180}{92} \\approx 1.95652 \\text{ L/h} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $CL_{H, \\text{baseline}} = 1.957$ L/h.\n\n**Scenario 2: Diminished OATP1B1 Function**\nThe intrinsic uptake clearance is reduced, while other parameters remain unchanged:\n$Q_{H} = 90$ L/h\n$f_{u,b} = 0.05$\n$CL_{\\text{int,uptake}} = 100$ L/h\n$CL_{\\text{int,met}} = 50$ L/h\n\nFirst, we compute the new overall intrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int}}$:\n$$ CL_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{100 \\times 50}{100 + 50} = \\frac{5000}{150} = \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ L/h} $$\nNext, we compute the new hepatic clearance, $CL_H$:\nThe term $f_{u,b} CL_{\\text{int}}$ is $0.05 \\times \\frac{100}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}$ L/h.\n$$ CL_{H, \\text{diminished}} = 90 \\times \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}}{90 + \\frac{5}{3}} = 90 \\times \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}}{\\frac{270+5}{3}} = 90 \\times \\frac{5}{275} = \\frac{450}{275} = \\frac{18}{11} \\approx 1.63636 \\text{ L/h} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $CL_{H, \\text{diminished}} = 1.636$ L/h.\n\nThe two computed hepatic clearances are $1.957$ L/h for the baseline scenario and $1.636$ L/h for the diminished uptake scenario.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.957 & 1.636\n\\end{pmatrix}\n} $$", "id": "4572266"}, {"introduction": "A change in hepatic clearance directly translates to altered systemic drug exposure, which is the primary driver of both efficacy and toxicity.
