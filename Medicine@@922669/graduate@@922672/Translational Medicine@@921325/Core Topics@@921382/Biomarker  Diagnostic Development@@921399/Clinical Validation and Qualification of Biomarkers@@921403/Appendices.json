By computing metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, you will practice using the common language that describes a test's performance, while also considering how the specific Context of Use (COU) dictates which metric is most critical for clinical decision-making [@problem_id:4999473].", "problem": "A blood-based prognostic biomarker is being clinically validated for a screening Context of Use (COU), defined as early identification of individuals with a latent disease where missing a case would carry a high clinical cost. In a prospective cohort of $300$ participants, gold-standard adjudication after testing yields the following counts: True Positives (TP) $=68$, False Positives (FP) $=12$, False Negatives (FN) $=22$, True Negatives (TN) $=198$. Using fundamental definitions of conditional probability and classification performance grounded in frequentist counting, compute the following performance characteristics for the biomarker within this validation cohort: sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and accuracy. Then, identify which single performance metric is most aligned with the stated screening COU in which the clinical consequence of false negatives dominates decision-making. For output encoding, use the following numerical codes for the COU-aligned metric: $1$ for sensitivity, $2$ for specificity, $3$ for PPV, $4$ for NPV, $5$ for accuracy. Report all five metric values as decimals (not percentages) and round each to four significant figures.
