Assume measurement errors are independent and identically distributed and well-approximated by Gaussian noise for both blank and low-level conditions.\n\nBy definition, the Limit of Blank (LOB) is the highest apparent analyte concentration expected to be observed when measuring replicates of a blank sample, under a chosen one-sided false positive probability criterion.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of analytical chemistry and statistics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively stated.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of two key analytical performance metrics for a biomarker assay: the Limit of Blank (LOB) and the Limit of Detection (LOD). The analysis is based on a Gaussian noise model for the assay measurements.\n\nLet $X_{\\text{blank}}$ be the random variable representing the measured concentration of a blank sample (containing no analyte). The problem states that the measurement error is Gaussian. Therefore, the distribution of $X_{\\text{blank}}$ is a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_{\\text{blank}}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\text{blank}}$.\n$$X_{\\text{blank}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{blank}}, \\sigma_{\\text{blank}}^2)$$\nThe given sample statistics are used as estimates for these population parameters: $\\mu_{\\text{blank}} = 0.05$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{blank}} = 0.02$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Limit of Blank (LOB). The LOB is defined as the $0.95$ quantile of the blank measurement distribution. This is the value LOB such that the probability of a blank measurement being less than or equal to it is $0.95$.\n$$P(X_{\\text{blank}} \\le \\text{LOB}) = 0.95$$\nTo find this value, we standardize the random variable $X_{\\text{blank}}$ to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$:\n$$Z = \\frac{X_{\\text{blank}} - \\mu_{\\text{blank}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{blank}}}$$\nThe probability statement becomes:\n$$P\\left(\\frac{X_{\\text{blank}} - \\mu_{\\text{blank}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{blank}}} \\le \\frac{\\text{LOB} - \\mu_{\\text{blank}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{blank}}}\\right) = 0.95$$\nLet $z_{0.95}$ denote the $0.95$ quantile of the standard normal distribution, which is given as $1.645$. The equation implies:\n$$\\frac{\\text{LOB} - \\mu_{\\text{blank}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{blank}}} = z_{0.95}$$\nSolving for LOB, we obtain the explicit expression in terms of the blank sample parameters:\n$$\\text{LOB} = \\mu_{\\text{blank}} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{blank}}$$\nSubstituting the given value $z_{0.95} = 1.645$, the expression is:\n$$\\text{LOB} = \\mu_{\\text{blank}} + 1.645 \\sigma_{\\text{blank}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of LOB using the provided data: $\\mu_{\\text{blank}} = 0.05$ ng/mL and $\\sigma_{\\text{blank}} = 0.02$ ng/mL.\n$$\\text{LOB} = 0.05 + 1.645 \\times 0.02 = 0.05 + 0.0329 = 0.0829$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. Thus, $\\text{LOB} = 0.08290$ ng/mL.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Limit of Detection (LOD). The LOD is the smallest true analyte concentration such that a measurement has a $0.95$ probability of exceeding the LOB. Let $X_{\\text{LOD}}$ be the random variable for a measurement of a sample with this true concentration, LOD.

We standardize the variable $X_{\\text{LOD}}$:\n$$P\\left(\\frac{X_{\\text{LOD}} - \\text{LOD}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}  \\frac{\\text{LOB} - \\text{LOD}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}\\right) = 0.95$$\nLet $Z$ be a standard normal variable. The inequality is $P(Z  q) = 0.95$, which implies that $q$ is the $0.05$ quantile of the standard normal distribution, $z_{0.05}$. By the symmetry of the normal distribution, $z_{0.05} = -z_{0.95} = -1.645$.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\text{LOB} - \\text{LOD}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}} = -z_{0.95}$$\nSolving for LOD, we get the expression:\n$$\\text{LOD} = \\text{LOB} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{low}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for LOB, we obtain the explicit expression for LOD in terms of all three given parameters: $\\mu_{\\text{blank}}$, $\\sigma_{\\text{blank}}$, and $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$.\n$$\\text{LOD} = (\\mu_{\\text{blank}} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{blank}}) + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{low}} = \\mu_{\\text{blank}} + z_{0.95} (\\sigma_{\\text{blank}} + \\sigma_{\\text{low}})$$\nWith $z_{0.95} = 1.645$, the expression is:\n$$\\text{LOD} = \\mu_{\\text{blank}} + 1.645(\\sigma_{\\text{blank}} + \\sigma_{\\text{low}})$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of LOD.

A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe analysis begins with the law of mass action applied to the two competing binding equilibria at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThe reaction for the analyte $A$ binding to the receptor $R$ is:\n$$R + A \\rightleftharpoons RA$$\nThe association constant, $K_{a,A}$, is defined as:\n$$K_{a,A} = \\frac{[RA]}{[R][A]}$$\nwhere $[RA]$, $[R]$, and $[A]$ are the molar concentrations of the antibody-analyte complex, the free antibody, and the free analyte at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the reaction for the interferent $I$ binding to the receptor $R$ is:\n$$R + I \\rightleftharpoons RI$$\nThe association constant, $K_{a,I}$, is defined as:\n$$K_{a,I} = \\frac{[RI]}{[R][I]}$$\nwhere $[RI]$ and $[I]$ are the molar concentrations of the antibody-interferent complex and the free interferent at equilibrium.\n\nThe problem states that the signal $S$ is proportional to the fraction of occupied capture sites. Since the detection system does not distinguish between species bound to the receptor, the signal produced by an $RA$ complex is indistinguishable from that produced by an $RI$ complex. The total signal $S_{total}$ is the sum of the signal contributed by the analyte, $S_A$, and the signal contributed by the interferent, $S_I$.\nLet $k$ be the proportionality constant that relates the concentration of a bound complex to the signal it generates. Then:\n$$S_A = k[RA]$$\n$$S_I = k[RI]$$\n\nThe \"percent cross-reactivity,\" which we will denote as $C_R$, is defined as the ratio of the signal contributed by $I$ to the signal contributed by $A$.\n$$C_R = \\frac{S_I}{S_A} = \\frac{k[RI]}{k[RA]}$$\nThe proportionality constant $k$ cancels, yielding an expression purely in terms of equilibrium concentrations:\n$$C_R = \\frac{[RI]}{[RA]}$$\nTo find this ratio, we rearrange the equilibrium constant expressions to solve for $[RA]$ and $[RI]$:\n$$[RA] = K_{a,A} [R] [A]$$\n$$[RI] = K_{a,I} [R] [I]$$\nNow, we can substitute these into the expression for $C_R$:\n$$C_R = \\frac{K_{a,I} [R] [I]}{K_{a,A} [R] [A]}$$\nThe concentration of the free receptor, $[R]$, which is common to both equilibria, cancels from the numerator and denominator. This is a critical result, as it indicates the ratio is independent of the total receptor concentration and the degree of receptor saturation, provided that $[R]  0$.\n$$C_R = \\frac{K_{a,I} [I]}{K_{a,A} [A]}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to group the affinity constants and the ligand concentrations:\n$$C_R = \\left(\\frac{K_{a,I}}{K_{a,A}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{[I]}{[A]}\\right)$$\nThe problem provides definitions for these two ratios. The affinity ratio is given as $r = \\frac{K_{a,I}}{K_{a,A}}$. The concentration relationship is given as $[I] = 10 \\times [A]$, which implies $\\frac{[I]}{[A]} = 10$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the derived expression for $C_R$:\n$$C_R = r \\cdot \\frac{[I]}{[A]}$$\nThis is the general expression for the cross-reactivity ratio under the stated assumptions.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n-   $r = 0.1$\n-   $\\frac{[I]}{[A]} = 10$\n\n$$C_R = (0.1) \\times (10) = 1.0$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
