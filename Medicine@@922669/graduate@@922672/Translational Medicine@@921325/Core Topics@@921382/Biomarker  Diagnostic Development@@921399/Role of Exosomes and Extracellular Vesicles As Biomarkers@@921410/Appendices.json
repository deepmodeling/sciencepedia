The context of EV isolation via ultracentrifugation is a standard and critical technique in biomedical research and translational medicine. All concepts, such as Stokes' drag, buoyancy, and centrifugal force, are fundamental and correctly applied.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

EV diameters are typically in the specified range, an RCF of $100,000 \\times g$ is standard for ultracentrifugation protocols targeting small vesicles, and the viscosity and buoyant density values are appropriate for a biological particle in a saline buffer. The setup is self-consistent and reflects a real-world scientific scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe time required for the Extracellular Vesicle (EV) to travel from radius $r_i$ to $r_f$ is determined by its sedimentation velocity under centrifugation. This velocity is reached when the net outward force (centrifugal minus buoyant) is balanced by the inward drag force.\n\nFirst, we state the physical assumptions:\n1.  The EV is treated as a perfect, rigid sphere of radius $R$. This is a common and effective approximation for vesicles in sedimentation analysis.\n2.  The suspension is sufficiently dilute such that particle-particle interactions are negligible.\n3.  The flow of the medium (PBS) around the EV is laminar, allowing the use of Stokes' law for the drag force. This assumption will be validated by calculating the Reynolds number.\n4.  The viscosity $\\eta$ and density difference $\\Delta \\rho$ are constant throughout the sedimentation path.\n\nAn EV at a radial position $r$ in a rotor spinning with angular velocity $\\omega$ experiences three primary forces along the radial direction:\n1.  The centrifugal force, $F_c$, acting outwards:\n    $$F_c = m_p a_c = (\\rho_p V) (\\omega^2 r)$$\n    where $m_p$ is the mass of the EV, $\\rho_p$ is its density, $V$ is its volume, and $a_c = \\omega^2 r$ is the centrifugal acceleration. For a sphere of radius $R$, the volume is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$.\n\n2.  The buoyant force, $F_b$, acting inwards, which is equal to the centrifugal force on the displaced mass of the fluid:\n    $$F_b = m_f a_c = (\\rho_f V) (\\omega^2 r)$$\n    where $m_f$ is the mass of the displaced fluid and $\\rho_f$ is the fluid density.\n\n3.  The Stokes' drag force, $F_d$, acting inwards, opposing the motion of the EV:\n    $$F_d = 6 \\pi \\eta R v$$\n    where $v$ is the sedimentation velocity of the EV relative to the fluid.\n\nThe net outward force on the EV is $F_{net} = F_c - F_b = (\\rho_p - \\rho_f) V \\omega^2 r = \\Delta \\rho V \\omega^2 r$. At terminal velocity, this net force is balanced by the drag force:\n$$F_{net} = F_d$$\n$$\\Delta \\rho \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) \\omega^2 r = 6 \\pi \\eta R v$$\n\nThe sedimentation velocity $v$ is the instantaneous rate of change of the radial position, $v = \\frac{dr}{dt}$. Substituting this and simplifying the equation:\n$$\\frac{dr}{dt} = v = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho (\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3) \\omega^2 r}{6 \\pi \\eta R} = \\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho R^2 \\omega^2}{9 \\eta} r$$\nThis differential equation relates the EV's radial position to time. The term $\\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho R^2}{9 \\eta}$ is the sedimentation coefficient, $s$, as defined by the Svedberg relation $v = s \\omega^2 r$.\n\nThe problem provides the Relative Centrifugal Field (RCF) at the outer radius $r_f$. RCF is defined as $RCF = \\frac{a_c}{g} = \\frac{\\omega^2 r_f}{g}$. We can use this to find $\\omega^2$:\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r_f}$$\nThe differential equation is separable:\n$$\\frac{dr}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho R^2 \\omega^2}{9 \\eta}\\right) dt$$\nTo find the total time $T$ for the EV to travel from $r_i$ to $r_f$, we integrate both sides over the respective limits:\n$$\\int_{r_i}^{r_f} \\frac{dr}{r} = \\int_0^T \\left(\\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho R^2 \\omega^2}{9 \\eta}\\right) dt$$\nThe term in the parenthesis on the right side is constant with respect to time.\n$$[\\ln(r)]_{r_i}^{r_f} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho R^2 \\omega^2}{9 \\eta}\\right) [t]_0^T$$\n$$\\ln(r_f) - \\ln(r_i) = \\left(\\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho R^2 \\omega^2}{9 \\eta}\\right) T$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_f}{r_i}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho R^2 \\omega^2}{9 \\eta}\\right) T$$\nSolving for the sedimentation time $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{9 \\eta}{2 \\Delta \\rho R^2 \\omega^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_f}{r_i}\\right)$$\nThis is the derived expression for the sedimentation time.\n\n### Calculation of Sedimentation Time\nWe now substitute the given values:\n-   $d = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, so the radius is $R = \\frac{d}{2} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   $\\eta = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n-   $\\Delta \\rho = 30\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$.\n-   $RCF = 1.00 \\times 10^5$.\n-   $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$.\n-   $r_i = 0.070\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   $r_f = 0.120\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFirst, calculate $\\omega^2$:\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^5) \\cdot (9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}})}{0.120\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 8.175 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}$$\nNow, substitute all values into the expression for $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{9 (1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-1}})}{2 (30\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) (6.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 (8.175 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.120\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.070\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right)$$\n$$T = \\frac{9.00 \\times 10^{-3}}{60 \\cdot (3.6 \\times 10^{-15}) \\cdot (8.175 \\times 10^6)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$T = \\frac{9.00 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.7658 \\times 10^{-6}} \\ln(1.71428...)\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$T \\approx (5096.84\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\cdot (0.538996) \\approx 2747.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem asks for the time in minutes, rounded to three significant figures:\n$$T_{min} = \\frac{2747.1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{60\\,\\mathrm{s\\,min^{-1}}} \\approx 45.785\\,\\mathrm{min}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $T_{min} = 45.8\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n\n### Justification of Assumptions\nWe must validate the use of Stokes' law by calculating the Reynolds number, $Re = \\frac{\\rho_f D v}{\\eta}$, where $D=2R$ is the particle diameter. The velocity $v$ is maximum at the largest radius, $r_f$.

The plasma sample was diluted before NTA by mixing $1$ part biological sample with $199$ parts buffer, giving a dilution factor $D = 200$.\n\nThree independent NTA runs on the diluted sample were performed. Each run reports the number of unique EV tracks detected, $k_i$, together with the instrument’s effective sampled volume for that run, $V_i$, obtained by integrating the imaged volume over time while accounting for particle motion and tracking.

Calnexin: $C_{EV, Calnexin} = 5$, $C_{cell, Calnexin} = 200$.\n   $$E_{Calnexin} = 2 \\times \\frac{5}{200} = \\frac{10}{200} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$$\n2. GM130: $C_{EV, GM130} = 3$, $C_{cell, GM130} = 160$.\n   $$E_{GM130} = 2 \\times \\frac{3}{160} = \\frac{6}{160} = \\frac{3}{80} = 0.0375$$\n3. Cytochrome c: $C_{EV, CytoC} = 2$, $C_{cell, CytoC} = 140$.\n   $$E_{CytoC} = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{140} = \\frac{4}{140} = \\frac{1}{35}$$\n4. Histone H3: $C_{EV, HistH3} = 1$, $C_{cell, HistH3} = 180$.\n   $$E_{HistH3} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{180} = \\frac{1}{90}$$\n\nLet $GM_{neg}$ be the geometric mean for the contaminant (negative) markers:\n$$GM_{neg} = (E_{Calnexin} \\cdot E_{GM130} \\cdot E_{CytoC} \\cdot E_{HistH3})^{1/4}$$\n$$GM_{neg} = \\left(\\frac{1}{20} \\times \\frac{3}{80} \\times \\frac{1}{35} \\times \\frac{1}{90}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{3}{20 \\times 80 \\times 35 \\times 90}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5040000}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1680000}\\right)^{1/4}$$\n\nThe composite index $I$ is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the geometric mean of positive marker enrichments to that of the contaminant marker enrichments.\n$$I = \\ln\\left(\\frac{GM_{pos}}{GM_{neg}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $GM_{pos}$ and $GM_{neg}$:\n$$I = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(360)^{1/4}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{1680000}\\right)^{1/4}}\\right) = \\ln\\left( \\left(360 \\times 1680000\\right)^{1/4} \\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(x^a) = a \\ln(x)$:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{4} \\ln(360 \\times 1680000) = \\frac{1}{4} \\ln(604800000)$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\ln(604800000) \\approx 20.2215351$$\n$$I = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20.2215351 \\approx 5.055383775$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$I \\approx 5.055$$\nThis positive and large value for the index indicates a strong enrichment of exosome-positive markers and a strong depletion of contaminants, consistent with a successful EV purification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.055}$$", "id": "5058423"}]}
