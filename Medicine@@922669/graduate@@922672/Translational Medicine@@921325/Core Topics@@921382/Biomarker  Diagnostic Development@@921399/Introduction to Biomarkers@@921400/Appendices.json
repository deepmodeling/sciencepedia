It presents a standard statistical task within a realistic context of translational medicine. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three tasks: first, a theoretical explanation of the properties of a standardized variable; second, the calculation of standardized values for three subjects; and third, the calculation of the arithmetic mean of these standardized values.\n\n**Part 1: Theoretical Properties of a Standardized Variable**\n\nLet $X$ be a real-valued random variable representing a measurement, such as LDL cholesterol concentration. The problem states that $X$ has a finite mean, denoted by $\\mu = E[X]$, and a finite, strictly positive standard deviation, denoted by $\\sigma = \\sqrt{Var(X)}$, where $\\sigma > 0$.\n\nThe standardization transformation defines a new random variable, $Z$, as follows:\n$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nWe will demonstrate that $Z$ is dimensionless and has a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$.\n\n1.  **Dimensionless Nature of $Z$**:\n    The mean, $\\mu$, is the expected value of $X$, and as such, it must have the same physical units as $X$. Let the units of $X$ be denoted by $[U]$. Then, the units of $\\mu$ are also $[U]$. The difference, $(X - \\mu)$, therefore has units of $[U]$.\n    The variance, $Var(X) = E[(X-\\mu)^2]$, has units of $[U]^2$. The standard deviation, $\\sigma = \\sqrt{Var(X)}$, therefore has units of $\\sqrt{[U]^2} = [U]$.\n    The standardized variable $Z$ is the ratio of $(X - \\mu)$ to $\\sigma$. The units of $Z$ are the ratio of the units of the numerator to the units of the denominator:\n    $$ \\text{Units of } Z = \\frac{\\text{Units of } (X-\\mu)}{\\text{Units of } \\sigma} = \\frac{[U]}{[U]} = 1 $$\n    A quantity with units of $1$ is, by definition, dimensionless. The transformation effectively removes the original units of measurement.\n\n2.  **Mean of $Z$**:\n    We compute the expected value of $Z$ using the linearity property of the expectation operator, which states that for any constants $a$ and $b$, $E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b$.\n    $$ E[Z] = E\\left[ \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right] $$\n    We can rewrite the expression for $Z$ as $Z = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}X - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$. Since $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are constants for the distribution of $X$, the terms $\\frac{1}{\\sigma}$ and $\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$ are also constants.\n    Applying the linearity property with $a = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}$ and $b = -\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$:\n    $$ E[Z] = E\\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sigma}X - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}E[X] - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} $$\n    By definition, $E[X] = \\mu$. Substituting this into the equation:\n    $$ E[Z] = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}(\\mu) - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} = 0 $$\n    Thus, the mean of the standardized variable $Z$ is $0$. This relies on $\\mu$ being finite and $\\sigma$ being finite and non-zero.\n\n3.  **Variance of $Z$**:\n    We compute the variance of $Z$ using the property of variance that for any constants $a$ and $b$, $Var(aX + b) = a^2 Var(X)$.\n    $$ Var(Z) = Var\\left( \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) = Var\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma}X - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) $$\n    Applying the variance property with $a = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}$ and $b = -\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$:\n    $$ Var(Z) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\right)^2 Var(X) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} Var(X) $$\n    By definition, the variance of $X$ is $Var(X) = \\sigma^2$. Substituting this into the equation:\n    $$ Var(Z) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} (\\sigma^2) = 1 $$\n    Thus, the variance of the standardized variable $Z$ is $1$. This derivation also relies on $\\sigma$ being finite and strictly positive. The standard deviation of $Z$ is $\\sqrt{Var(Z)} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Subject-Specific Standardized Values**\n\nThe problem provides the reference population parameters $\\mu_{\\text{ref}} = 130$ mg/dL and $\\sigma_{\\text{ref}} = 25$ mg/dL. The individual measurements are $x_{1} = 190$ mg/dL, $x_{2} = 100$ mg/dL, and $x_{3} = 120$ mg/dL. We calculate the subject-specific standardized value, or z-score, $z_i$, for each subject $i$ using the formula:\n$$ z_i = \\frac{x_i - \\mu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{ref}}} $$\n\nFor subject $1$:\n$$ z_1 = \\frac{x_1 - \\mu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{190 - 130}{25} = \\frac{60}{25} = 2.4 $$\n\nFor subject $2$:\n$$ z_2 = \\frac{x_2 - \\mu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{100 - 130}{25} = \\frac{-30}{25} = -1.2 $$\n\nFor subject $3$:\n$$ z_3 = \\frac{x_3 - \\mu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{120 - 130}{25} = \\frac{-10}{25} = -0.4 $$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Mean Standardized Value**\n\nThe final step is to compute the arithmetic mean, $\\bar{z}$, of the three standardized values $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$.\n$$ \\bar{z} = \\frac{z_1 + z_2 + z_3}{3} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ \\bar{z} = \\frac{2.4 + (-1.2) + (-0.4)}{3} = \\frac{2.4 - 1.2 - 0.4}{3} = \\frac{0.8}{3} $$\nThis fraction is a repeating decimal:\n$$ \\bar{z} = 0.266666... $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final mean standardized value to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $6$, $6$, $6$. The fifth digit is a $6$, so we round the fourth digit up.\n$$ \\bar{z} \\approx 0.2667 $$\nThis value is dimensionless, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2667}\n$$", "id": "5025538"}, {"introduction": "While sensitivity and specificity describe a biomarker's performance, they don't directly answer the clinician's question: 'Given this test result, what is the probability my patient has the disease?'

The denominator can be expressed using specificity. The event $T{+}$ given $D{-}$ is the complement of the event $T{-}$ given $D{-}$. Therefore, $\\Pr(T{+}\\mid D{-}) = 1 - \\Pr(T{-}\\mid D{-})$. By definition, $\\Pr(T{-}\\mid D{-}) = \\text{Sp}$. Thus, $\\Pr(T{+}\\mid D{-}) = 1 - \\text{Sp}$. Substituting these into the definition of $\\text{LR}^{+}$ yields:\n$$\n\\text{LR}^{+} = \\frac{\\text{Se}}{1 - \\text{Sp}}\n$$\nThe negative likelihood ratio, $\\text{LR}^{-}$, is defined similarly for a negative test result:\n$$\n\\text{LR}^{-} = \\frac{\\Pr(T{-}\\mid D{+})}{\\Pr(T{-}\\mid D{-})}\n$$\nThe numerator, $\\Pr(T{-}\\mid D{+})$, is the complement of $\\Pr(T{+}\\mid D{+})$, so $\\Pr(T{-}\\mid D{+}) = 1 - \\Pr(T{+}\\mid D{+}) = 1 - \\text{Se}$. The denominator is, by definition, the specificity $\\text{Sp}$. Substituting these yields:\n$$\n\\text{LR}^{-} = \\frac{1 - \\text{Se}}{\\text{Sp}}\n$$\nAs the expressions for both $\\text{LR}^{+}$ and $\\text{LR}^{-}$ are formulated exclusively in terms of $\\text{Se}$ and $\\text{Sp}$, their values are intrinsic to the test itself and are demonstrably invariant to the pre-test probability or prevalence of the disease, $\\Pr(D{+})$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Bayesian Updating and Post-Test Probability**\n\nThe second task is to compute the patient's post-test probability of disease, $\\Pr(D{+}\\mid T{+})$, using the odds form of Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe odds of an event $A$ are given by $\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{\\Pr(A)}{1 - \\Pr(A)}$.\nThe pre-test odds of disease are $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{\\Pr(D{+})}{\\Pr(D{-})}$.\nThe post-test odds of disease, given a positive test result $T{+}$, are $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\Pr(D{+}\\mid T{+})}{\\Pr(D{-}\\mid T{+})}$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we can write the post-test odds as:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\Pr(D{+}\\cap T{+})/\\Pr(T{+})}{\\Pr(D{-}\\cap T{+})/\\Pr(T{+})} = \\frac{\\Pr(D{+}\\cap T{+})}{\\Pr(D{-}\\cap T{+})}\n$$\nApplying the multiplication rule for probability, $\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A\\mid B)\\Pr(B)$:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\Pr(T{+}\\mid D{+})\\Pr(D{+})}{\\Pr(T{+}\\mid D{-})\\Pr(D{-})}\n$$\nThis expression can be factored into two components:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(T{+}\\mid D{+})}{\\Pr(T{+}\\mid D{-})}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(D{+})}{\\Pr(D{-})}\\right)\n$$\nWe recognize the first term as the positive likelihood ratio, $\\text{LR}^{+}$, and the second term as the pre-test odds, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$.
