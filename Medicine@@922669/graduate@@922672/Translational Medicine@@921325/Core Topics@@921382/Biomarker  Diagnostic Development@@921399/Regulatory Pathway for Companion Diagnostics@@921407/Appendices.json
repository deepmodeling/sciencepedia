Core Definitions and Theorems**\n- **Conditional Probability:** For two events $A$ and $B$, $P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, provided $P(B) > 0$. This can be rearranged to $P(A \\cap B) = P(A | B) P(B)$.\n- **Bayes' Theorem:** By symmetry, $P(A \\cap B) = P(B | A) P(A)$. Equating the two expressions for $P(A \\cap B)$ and rearranging gives Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n- **Law of Total Probability:** For any event $A$ and a partition of the sample space $\\{B_i\\}$, $P(A) = \\sum_i P(A \\cap B_i) = \\sum_i P(A | B_i) P(B_i)$. In our case, the patient population is partitioned into responders ($R$) and non-responders ($R^c$). Thus, for an event such as $T^+$, its probability is:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | R) P(R) + P(T^+ | R^c) P(R^c)$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is $P(R | T^+)$. Applying Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(R | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | R) P(R)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we use the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | R) P(R) + P(T^+ | R^c) P(R^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T^+ | R)$ (sensitivity) and $P(R)$ (prevalence). We need $P(T^+ | R^c)$. This is the probability of a positive test in a non-responder, which is $1$ minus the specificity.\n$$P(T^+ | R^c) = 1 - P(T^- | R^c) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | R) P(R) + (1 - P(T^- | R^c)) P(R^c)$$\nFinally, substituting the full expression for $P(T^+)$ into the Bayes' theorem formulation for PPV yields the complete expression:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | R) P(R)}{P(T^+ | R) P(R) + (1 - P(T^- | R^c)) P(R^c)}$$\n\n**3. Derivation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is $P(R^c | T^-)$. Applying Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(R^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^-)$, we use the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | R) P(R) + P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T^- | R^c)$ (specificity) and $P(R^c)$. We need $P(T^- | R)$. This is the probability of a negative test in a responder, which is $1$ minus the sensitivity.\n$$P(T^- | R) = 1 - P(T^+ | R) = 1 - \\text{sensitivity}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P(T^-)$:\n$$P(T^-) = (1 - P(T^+ | R)) P(R) + P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)$$\nFinally, substituting the full expression for $P(T^-)$ into the Bayes' theorem formulation for NPV yields the complete expression:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)}{(1 - P(T^+ | R)) P(R) + P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)}$$\n\n**4. Numerical Computation**\nUsing the given values:\n- $P(R) = 0.30$\n- $P(R^c) = 0.70$\n- $P(T^+ | R) = 0.85$\n- $P(T^- | R^c) = 0.90$\n\nWe can first calculate the terms needed for the denominators:\n- $1 - P(T^- | R^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$\n- $1 - P(T^+ | R) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$\n\n**Computation of PPV:**\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.30)}{(0.85)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.70)} = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + 0.070} = \\frac{0.255}{0.325} \\approx 0.78461538$$\nRounded to $4$ significant figures, $PPV = 0.7846$.\n\n**Computation of NPV:**\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.70)}{(0.15)(0.30) + (0.90)(0.70)} = \\frac{0.63}{0.045 + 0.63} = \\frac{0.63}{0.675} \\approx 0.93333333$$\nRounded to $4$ significant figures, $NPV = 0.9333$.\n\n**5. Interpretation of Implications**\nThe calculated values provide critical insights into the clinical utility of the test and the proposed treatment strategy.\n- **Positive Predictive Value ($PPV = 0.7846$):** This value indicates that among patients who test positive, there is a $78.46\\%$ probability that they are indeed true responders. While this represents a significant enrichment from the baseline prevalence of $30\\%$, it also implies that $100\\% - 78.46\\% = 21.54\\%$ of test-positive individuals are false positives. Following the label's recommendation to treat all test-positive patients means that approximately $21.54\\%$ of treated patients will be exposed to the therapy's costs and potential toxicities without the likelihood of a clinically meaningful benefit.\n- **Negative Predictive Value ($NPV = 0.9333$):** This value is very high, indicating that among patients who test negative, there is a $93.33\\%$ probability that they are true non-responders. Following the label's recommendation to withhold therapy from test-negative patients means that the vast majority of these patients are correctly spared an ineffective treatment. However, it also implies that $100\\% - 93.33\\% = 6.67\\%$ of test-negative patients are false negatives. These patients, who would have likely benefited from the therapy, will be denied treatment.\n\n**Conclusion:** The test is highly effective for its \"rule-out\" function (a high NPV confidently identifies non-responders), which is valuable for avoiding unnecessary treatment. Its \"rule-in\" function (PPV) is moderately strong, substantially increasing the a priori probability of response but still leading to the treatment of a notable fraction of non-responders. The decision to approve and adopt this strategy depends on a careful assessment of the clinical context, including the severity of the disease, the magnitude of the therapeutic benefit for true responders, and the severity of the treatment's side effects and costs.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7846 & 0.9333 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5056565"}]}
