The terms ICER, NMB, QALY, and willingness-to-pay threshold are well-defined and central to the field. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data ($\\Delta C$, $\\Delta E$, $\\lambda$) are provided to compute the requested quantities. The language is objective and unambiguous.

The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is not ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe analysis proceeds from the foundational definitions of cost-effectiveness analysis. We are given the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, and the incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta E$, of a new therapy compared to a standard of care.\n\n1.  **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**\n    The ICER is a primary metric in cost-effectiveness analysis. It represents the additional cost per unit of additional health outcome gained. By its fundamental definition, it is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness.\n    \n    The expression for the ICER is:\n    $$\n    ICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n    $$\n    Using the provided numerical values:\n    $\\Delta C = 12000$ (in dollars)\n    $\\Delta E = 0.4$ (in QALYs)\n    \n    The numerical value of the ICER is calculated as:\n    $$\n    ICER = \\frac{12000}{0.4} = \\frac{120000}{4} = 30000\n    $$\n    The units of the ICER are dollars per QALY, or $\\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$.\n\n2.  **Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)**\n    The NMB is an alternative metric that quantifies the value of an intervention in monetary terms. It is derived by first monetizing the incremental health gain using the societal willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$, and then subtracting the incremental cost. The value $\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E$ represents the monetary worth of the health gain, and $\\Delta C$ is its cost. The net benefit is the difference.\n    \n    The expression for the NMB is:\n    $$\n    NMB = (\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n    $$\n    An intervention is considered cost-effective if its NMB is positive ($NMB > 0$), meaning the monetized value of the health gain exceeds the cost.\n    \n    Using the provided numerical values:\n    $\\lambda = 30000$ (in dollars per QALY)\n    $\\Delta E = 0.4$ (in QALYs)\n    $\\Delta C = 12000$ (in dollars)\n    \n    The numerical value of the NMB is calculated as:\n    $$\n    NMB = (30000 \\cdot 0.4) - 12000 = 12000 - 12000 = 0\n    $$\n    The unit of the NMB is dollars ($\\$$). An NMB of $0$ indicates that the monetized health gain is exactly equal to the cost of the intervention.\n\n3.  **Decision Indicator (D)**\n    The decision indicator $D$ is to be formalized based on the NMB and the specified decision rules. The intervention is:\n    - Cost-effective if $NMB > 0$.\n    - Indifferent if $NMB = 0$.\n    - Not cost-effective if $NMB  0$.\n    \n    The indicator $D$ is defined with the values $1$, $0$, and $-1$ corresponding to these three cases. This structure formally corresponds to the signum function, denoted $\\text{sgn}(x)$, which extracts the sign of a real number.\n    \n    Therefore, the decision indicator $D$ can be formalized as:\n    $$\n    D = \\text{sgn}(NMB) = \\text{sgn}((\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E) - \\Delta C)\n    $$\n    where the signum function is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\text{sgn}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ -1  \\text{if } x  0 \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    We have already calculated that $NMB = 0$. Therefore, the value of the decision indicator is:\n    $$\n    D = \\text{sgn}(0) = 0\n    $$\n    A value of $D=0$ signifies that the therapy is exactly on the cusp of cost-effectiveness at the given willingness-to-pay threshold. This is consistent with the finding that the $ICER = \\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$, which is equal to the threshold $\\lambda = \\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$.\n\n**Summary of Computations**\n- ICER: $30000$ ($\\$/\\text{QALY}$)\n- NMB: $0$ ($\\$$)\n- Decision Indicator $D$: $0$\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix $[\\text{ICER}, \\text{NMB}, D]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 30000  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5003623"}, {"introduction": "While the ICER is a widely used metric, its interpretation can be misleading, particularly when it yields a negative value. This practice presents a hypothetical yet powerful scenario to demonstrate this ambiguity, where a highly desirable (dominant) intervention and a highly undesirable (dominated) one produce the same negative ICER.

The ICER is defined as $\\mathrm{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}$, where $\\Delta C$ is the incremental cost and $\\Delta E$ is the incremental effect. A negative ICER arises in two distinct scenarios:\n$1$. When $\\Delta C  0$ and $\\Delta E  0$: The new intervention is more costly and less effective (harmful). It is \"dominated\" by the comparator and should never be adopted.\n$2$. When $\\Delta C  0$ and $\\Delta E  0$: The new intervention is less costly (cost-saving) and more effective. It is \"dominant\" over the comparator and should always be adopted.\n\nThe provided data for Program A and Program B illustrate this ambiguity.\nFor Program A: $\\Delta C_A = -200$ and $\\Delta E_A = 0.01$. The ICER is $\\mathrm{ICER}_A = \\frac{-200}{0.01} = -20,000$. This program is dominant.\nFor Program B: $\\Delta C_B = 200$ and $\\Delta E_B = -0.01$. The ICER is $\\mathrm{ICER}_B = \\frac{200}{-0.01} = -20,000$. This program is dominated.\nThe identical negative ICER obfuscates the fact that Program A is highly desirable while Program B is highly undesirable.\n\nTo derive a universally applicable criterion from first principles, we start with the societal objective to maximize net health value. The societal willingness-to-pay, $\\lambda$, represents the monetary value society places on one unit of health effect (one QALY).\n\nThe value of the incremental health effect, $\\Delta E$, can be expressed in monetary terms by multiplying it by $\\lambda$. This gives the monetized value of the health gain: $\\lambda \\Delta E$.\n\nThe net benefit of an intervention is the difference between the value it produces and the cost it incurs. We define the Incremental Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) as the monetized value of the incremental health effect minus the incremental cost.\n\nThe algebraic expression for the NMB is:\n$$ \\mathrm{NMB} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E) - \\Delta C $$\n\nThis expression serves as the decision criterion. An intervention is considered cost-effective and desirable if its NMB is greater than zero:\n$$ \\mathrm{NMB}  0 \\implies \\lambda \\Delta E - \\Delta C  0 $$\nA positive NMB signifies that the monetary value of the health benefit surpasses the cost required to achieve it. This criterion is robust and resolves the ambiguity of the ICER because it does not involve division and its interpretation is independent of the signs of $\\Delta C$ and $\\Delta E$.\n\nNow, we apply this derived criterion to the two programs using the given willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda = 50,000$ dollars per QALY.\n\nFor Program A:\nThe incremental cost is $\\Delta C_A = -200$ dollars.\nThe incremental effect is $\\Delta E_A = 0.01$ QALYs.\nThe incremental net monetary benefit for Program A is:\n$$ \\mathrm{NMB}_A = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E_A) - \\Delta C_A = (50,000 \\times 0.01) - (-200) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{NMB}_A = 500 + 200 = 700 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{NMB}_A = 700  0$, Program A is deemed cost-effective, which is consistent with it being a dominant intervention.\n\nFor Program B:\nThe incremental cost is $\\Delta C_B = 200$ dollars.\nThe incremental effect is $\\Delta E_B = -0.01$ QALYs.\nThe incremental net monetary benefit for Program B is:\n$$ \\mathrm{NMB}_B = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E_B) - \\Delta C_B = (50,000 \\times -0.01) - (200) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{NMB}_B = -500 - 200 = -700 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{NMB}_B = -700  0$, Program B is not cost-effective, which is consistent with it being a dominated intervention.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the absolute difference between the two incremental net monetary benefits.\n$$ \\text{Absolute Difference} = |\\mathrm{NMB}_A - \\mathrm{NMB}_B| $$\n$$ \\text{Absolute Difference} = |700 - (-700)| = |700 + 700| = |1400| = 1400 $$\nThe resulting value is $1400$ dollars.
