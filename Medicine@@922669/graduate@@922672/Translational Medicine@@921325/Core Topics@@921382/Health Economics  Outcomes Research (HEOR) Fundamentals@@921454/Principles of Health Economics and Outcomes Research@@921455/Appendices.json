The concepts of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), health utility (with values between $0$ and $1$), and discounting of future health outcomes are foundational to cost-effectiveness analysis.

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem formulation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution is provided below.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a measure of health outcome that combines the quantity of life (survival) with its quality (utility). For a discrete time period $t$ with cycle length $L$, the QALYs accrued during that period are given by the product of the utility $u(t)$ and the duration of survival in that period. With a survival probability $S(t-1)$ of entering period $t$ and surviving through it, the expected QALYs for period $t$ are $u(t) \\times L \\times S(t)$. The problem states the survival probability is $1$ throughout, meaning the individual is certain to live all $8$ years. The cycle length is $L=1$ year. Thus, the QALYs accrued in any given year $t$ are simply equal to the utility value for that year, $u(t)$.\n\n**1. Total Undiscounted QALYs**\n\nThe total undiscounted QALYs, denoted $Q_{\\text{undiscounted}}$, are the simple arithmetic sum of the health utility experienced in each year over the entire time horizon. The expression is derived by summing the utility values for each time period.\n\nLet $u(t)$ be the utility in year $t$. The total undiscounted QALYs are:\n$$Q_{\\text{undiscounted}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} u(t)$$\nGiven the problem specifics, the utility is $u_1 = 0.8$ for $t=1, \\dots, 5$ and $u_2 = 0.6$ for $t=6, \\dots, 8$. The expression can be written as:\n$$Q_{\\text{undiscounted}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{5} u_1 + \\sum_{t=6}^{8} u_2$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$Q_{\\text{undiscounted}} = (5 \\times u_1) + (3 \\times u_2)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Q_{\\text{undiscounted}} = (5 \\times 0.8) + (3 \\times 0.6) = 4.0 + 1.8 = 5.8$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the result is $5.800$ QALYs.\n\n**2. Total Discounted QALYs**\n\nDiscounting is applied in economic evaluations to reflect time preference, the principle that benefits received in the future are valued less than the same benefits received today. With a constant annual discount rate $r$, the value of a benefit received at the end of year $t$ is reduced by a discount factor of $\\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$. The problem specifies an \"end-of-year accrual\" convention, meaning the utility gained during year $t$ is valued as if it were received at the end of year $t$.\n\nThe total discounted QALYs, denoted $Q_{\\text{discounted}}$, are calculated by summing the discounted utility for each year. The expression is:\n$$Q_{\\text{discounted}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{u(t)}{(1+r)^t}$$\nSplitting this sum based on the two utility periods:\n$$Q_{\\text{discounted}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{5} \\frac{u_1}{(1+r)^t} + \\sum_{t=6}^{8} \\frac{u_2}{(1+r)^t}$$\nWe can factor out the constant utility values:\n$$Q_{\\text{discounted}} = u_1 \\sum_{t=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t} + u_2 \\sum_{t=6}^{8} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThis is the required discrete-time expression. Now we compute the value with $r=0.03$, $u_1=0.8$, and $u_2=0.6$.\n\n$$Q_{\\text{discounted}} = 0.8 \\left( \\frac{1}{1.03^1} + \\frac{1}{1.03^2} + \\frac{1}{1.03^3} + \\frac{1}{1.03^4} + \\frac{1}{1.03^5} \\right) + 0.6 \\left( \\frac{1}{1.03^6} + \\frac{1}{1.03^7} + \\frac{1}{1.03^8} \\right)$$\nThe sums are finite geometric series. The sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} a^k$ can be calculated with the formula for the present value of an annuity, $\\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}$.\nFor the first part:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{(1.03)^t} = \\frac{1-(1.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \\approx \\frac{1-0.86260878}{0.03} \\approx \\frac{0.13739122}{0.03} \\approx 4.579707 $$\nFor the second part:\n$$ \\sum_{t=6}^{8} \\frac{1}{(1.03)^t} = \\sum_{t=1}^{8} \\frac{1}{(1.03)^t} - \\sum_{t=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{(1.03)^t} $$\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{8} \\frac{1}{(1.03)^t} = \\frac{1-(1.03)^{-8}}{0.03} \\approx \\frac{1-0.78940923}{0.03} \\approx \\frac{0.21059077}{0.03} \\approx 7.019692 $$\nSo,\n$$ \\sum_{t=6}^{8} \\frac{1}{(1.03)^t} \\approx 7.019692 - 4.579707 \\approx 2.439985 $$\nNow, substitute these sums back into the expression for $Q_{\\text{discounted}}$:\n$$Q_{\\text{discounted}} \\approx (0.8 \\times 4.579707) + (0.6 \\times 2.439985)$$\n$$Q_{\\text{discounted}} \\approx 3.6637656 + 1.463991$$\n$$Q_{\\text{discounted}} \\approx 5.1277566$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $5.128$ QALYs.\n\n### Summary of Results\n-   The total undiscounted QALYs are calculated to be $5.800$.\n-   The total discounted QALYs at a $3\\%$ annual rate are calculated to be $5.128$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5.800  5.128\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5051454"}, {"introduction": "Once health outcomes are quantified, the next step is to compare the costs and benefits of different interventions to make efficient resource allocation decisions.

We first check for strict dominance, then for extended dominance.\n\n**Strict Dominance:** A strategy is strictly dominated if another strategy is both more effective and less costly.\nLet us examine the ordered list. When moving from Strategy $\\mathcal{C}$ to Strategy $\\mathcal{B}$, we observe that Strategy $\\mathcal{B}$ is more effective than Strategy $\\mathcal{C}$ ($E_{\\mathcal{B}} = 3.45  E_{\\mathcal{C}} = 3.40$) and is also less costly ($C_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\$42{,}000  C_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\$46{,}000$). Therefore, Strategy $\\mathcal{C}$ is strictly dominated by Strategy $\\mathcal{B}$. Any rational decision-maker would prefer $\\mathcal{B}$ over $\\mathcal{C}$, so $\\mathcal{C}$ is removed from further consideration.\n\nAfter removing the strictly dominated strategy $\\mathcal{C}$, the remaining strategies, ordered by effectiveness, are:\n1. Strategy $\\mathcal{A}$: $C = \\$35{,}000$, $E = 3.20$\n2. Strategy $\\mathcal{B}$: $C = \\$42{,}000$, $E = 3.45$\n3. Strategy $\\mathcal{D}$: $C = \\$54{,}000$, $E = 3.60$\nIn this reduced set, both cost and effectiveness increase monotonically.\n\n**Extended Dominance:** A strategy is subject to extended dominance (or is indirectly dominated) if the ICER associated with moving to it from the previous non-dominated strategy is greater than the ICER of moving from it to the next non-dominated strategy. This implies that the strategy lies above the line segment connecting its neighbors on the cost-effectiveness plane, making it an inefficient choice. The ICER between two strategies, $X$ and $Y$ (where $Y$ is more effective), is defined as:\n$$ \\text{ICER}_{X \\to Y} = \\frac{C_Y - C_X}{E_Y - E_X} $$\n\nWe calculate the ICER for each adjacent pair in the sequence $\\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathcal{D}$.\n\nFirst, the ICER for moving from $\\mathcal{A}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$:\n$$ \\text{ICER}_{\\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{B}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathcal{B}} - C_{\\mathcal{A}}}{E_{\\mathcal{B}} - E_{\\mathcal{A}}} = \\frac{\\$42{,}000 - \\$35{,}000}{3.45 - 3.20} = \\frac{\\$7{,}000}{0.25} = \\$28{,}000 \\text{ per QALY} $$\n\nNext, the ICER for moving from $\\mathcal{B}$ to $\\mathcal{D}$:\n$$ \\text{ICER}_{\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathcal{D}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathcal{D}} - C_{\\mathcal{B}}}{E_{\\mathcal{D}} - E_{\\mathcal{B}}} = \\frac{\\$54{,}000 - \\$42{,}000}{3.60 - 3.45} = \\frac{\\$12{,}000}{0.15} = \\$80{,}000 \\text{ per QALY} $$\n\nTo check for extended dominance of strategy $\\mathcal{B}$, we compare these two ICERs. A strategy is not extendedly dominated if the ICERs are increasing.\nWe have $\\text{ICER}_{\\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{B}} = \\$28{,}000$ and $\\text{ICER}_{\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathcal{D}} = \\$80{,}000$. Since $\\$28{,}000  \\$80{,}000$, the ICER is increasing. This indicates that Strategy $\\mathcal{B}$ is not extendedly dominated and lies on the convex cost-effectiveness frontier.\n\n**Step 3: Report the ICERs on the Cost-Effectiveness Frontier**\nThe cost-effectiveness frontier consists of the set of non-dominated strategies, which are $\\mathcal{A}$, $\\mathcal{B}$, and $\\mathcal{D}$. The path along this frontier progresses from the status quo ($\\mathcal{A}$) to $\\mathcal{B}$, and then to $\\mathcal{D}$. The ICERs on the frontier are the incremental ratios between these adjacent non-dominated strategies.\n\nThe ICERs are the values we have just calculated:\n1. The ICER for choosing Strategy $\\mathcal{B}$ over Strategy $\\mathcal{A}$ is $\\$28{,}000$ per QALY.\n2. The ICER for choosing Strategy $\\mathcal{D}$ over Strategy $\\mathcal{B}$ is $\\$80{,}000$ per QALY.\n\nThe problem requires the results to be rounded to four significant figures. Both $28{,}000$ and $80{,}000$ are exact integers calculated from the data. Written as $2.800 \\times 10^4$ and $8.000 \\times 10^4$, they have four significant figures.
