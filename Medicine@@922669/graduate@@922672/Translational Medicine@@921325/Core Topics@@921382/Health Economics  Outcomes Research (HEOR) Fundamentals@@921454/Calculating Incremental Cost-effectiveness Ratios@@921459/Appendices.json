It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the marginal Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for the first step on the efficient frontier of diagnostic strategies, after applying standard dominance rules. The strategies are evaluated based on their associated lifetime costs and health benefits, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).\n\nFirst, we list the given data for the four strategies: Standard Clinical Assessment (S), Biomarker-Guided Therapy (B), Broad Genomic Panel (G), and Whole-Genome plus Transcriptome sequencing (W). Let $C$ denote the cost and $E$ denote the effectiveness in QALYs.\n\n- Strategy S: $C_S = \\$40,000$, $E_S = 3.40$ QALYs\n- Strategy B: $C_B = \\$55,000$, $E_B = 3.75$ QALYs\n- Strategy G: $C_G = \\$62,000$, $E_G = 3.95$ QALYs\n- Strategy W: $C_W = \\$88,000$, $E_W = 4.10$ QALYs\n\nThe procedure involves three main steps as outlined in the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and remove any strictly dominated strategies.**\nA strategy is strictly dominated if another strategy is both less costly and more effective. We must order the strategies by their effectiveness (QALYs) to facilitate comparison. The order of increasing effectiveness is S, B, G, W.\n\n- $E_S  E_B  E_G  E_W$ ($3.40  3.75  3.95  4.10$)\n- $C_S  C_B  C_G  C_W$ ($\\$40,000  \\$55,000  \\$62,000  \\$88,000$)\n\nSince both cost and effectiveness increase for each subsequent strategy in the ordered list, no strategy is strictly dominated. For any pair of strategies, the one with higher effectiveness also has a higher cost.\n\n**Step 2: Assess and remove any extendedly dominated strategies.**\nExtended dominance occurs when a strategy is less cost-effective than a more effective strategy or a combination of other strategies. A practical method to identify extended dominance is to calculate the sequential ICERs for strategies ordered by effectiveness. If the sequence of ICERs is not monotonically increasing, extended dominance is present.\n\nThe ICER is defined as the change in cost divided by the change in effect:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_{\\text{new}} - C_{\\text{current}}}{E_{\\text{new}} - E_{\\text{current}}}\n$$\n\nLet's compute the ICERs for the ordered sequence S $\\rightarrow$ B $\\rightarrow$ G $\\rightarrow$ W.\n\n- ICER for B relative to S:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{\\text{B vs. S}} = \\frac{C_B - C_S}{E_B - E_S} = \\frac{\\$55,000 - \\$40,000}{3.75 - 3.40} = \\frac{\\$15,000}{0.35 \\text{ QALYs}} \\approx \\$42,857.14 \\text{ / QALY}\n$$\n\n- ICER for G relative to B:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{\\text{G vs. B}} = \\frac{C_G - C_B}{E_G - E_B} = \\frac{\\$62,000 - \\$55,000}{3.95 - 3.75} = \\frac{\\$7,000}{0.20 \\text{ QALYs}} = \\$35,000 \\text{ / QALY}\n$$\n\nWe observe that $\\text{ICER}_{\\text{B vs. S}}  \\text{ICER}_{\\text{G vs. B}}$ ($\\$42,857.14  \\$35,000$). This indicates that the incremental step from B to G is more cost-effective than the step from S to B. This is the condition for extended dominance of strategy B.\n\nTo confirm, we calculate the ICER of G relative to S, bypassing B:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{\\text{G vs. S}} = \\frac{C_G - C_S}{E_G - E_S} = \\frac{\\$62,000 - \\$40,000}{3.95 - 3.40} = \\frac{\\$22,000}{0.55 \\text{ QALYs}} = \\$40,000 \\text{ / QALY}\n$$\nSince $\\text{ICER}_{\\text{G vs. S}}  \\text{ICER}_{\\text{B vs. S}}$, it is more efficient to move directly from strategy S to strategy G than it is to adopt strategy B. Geometrically, on a cost-effectiveness plane, point B lies above the line segment connecting points S and G. Therefore, strategy B is extendedly dominated and must be removed from consideration.\n\nThe remaining strategies, which form the new efficiency frontier, are S, G, and W. We must check again for extended dominance in this reduced set.\n\n- ICER for G relative to S:\n$\\text{ICER}_{\\text{G vs. S}} = \\$40,000$ / QALY (calculated above).\n\n- ICER for W relative to G:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{\\text{W vs. G}} = \\frac{C_W - C_G}{E_W - E_G} = \\frac{\\$88,000 - \\$62,000}{4.10 - 3.95} = \\frac{\\$26,000}{0.15 \\text{ QALYs}} \\approx \\$173,333.33 \\text{ / QALY}\n$$\nThe sequence of ICERs for the efficient frontier (S $\\rightarrow$ G $\\rightarrow$ W) is now monotonically increasing ($\\$40,000  \\$173,333.33$).

The first movement along this frontier from the baseline strategy S is the transition to the next strategy on the frontier, which is G.\n\nThe marginal ICER for this movement is $\\text{ICER}_{\\text{G vs. S}}$.
