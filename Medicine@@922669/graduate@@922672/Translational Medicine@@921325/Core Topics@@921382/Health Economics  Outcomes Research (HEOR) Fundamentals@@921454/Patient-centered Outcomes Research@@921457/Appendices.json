We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe internal consistency of a scale is quantified by Cronbach's alpha, $\\alpha$. Its general definition is given in terms of the number of items, $k$, the variance of the individual items, $\\sigma_{X_i}^2$, and the variance of the total score, $\\sigma_S^2$. The total score $S$ is the sum of the individual item scores, $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} X_i$.\n\nThe formula for Cronbach's alpha is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_{X_i}^2}{\\sigma_S^2} \\right) $$\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the total score variance, $\\sigma_S^2$. The variance of a sum of variables is the sum of their individual variances plus twice the sum of all unique pairwise covariances:\n$$ \\sigma_S^2 = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{Var}(X_i) + 2 \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) $$\n\nThe problem states that the item variances are equal. Let us denote this common variance as $\\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2$.\n$$ \\text{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\} $$\nConsequently, the sum of item variances is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_{X_i}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 = k \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 $$\n\nNext, we express the covariance in terms of correlation. The correlation $\\rho_{ij}$ between items $X_i$ and $X_j$ is defined as:\n$$ \\rho_{ij} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X_i)\\text{Var}(X_j)}} $$\nGiven the assumption of equal item variances, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\rho_{ij} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)}{\\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2} \\implies \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\rho_{ij} \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 $$\n\nThe problem provides the average inter-item correlation, $\\bar{r}$. The total number of distinct item pairs is $\\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$. The average correlation is the sum of all unique pairwise correlations divided by this number:\n$$ \\bar{r} = \\frac{\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} \\rho_{ij}}{\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} $$\nThus, the sum of correlations is $\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} \\rho_{ij} = \\bar{r} \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$.\n\nNow we can express the sum of all unique pairwise covariances in terms of $\\bar{r}$:\n$$ \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} (\\rho_{ij} \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2) = \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} \\rho_{ij} $$\nSubstituting the sum of correlations:\n$$ \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 \\left( \\bar{r} \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \\right) $$\n\nWe can now substitute our terms for the sum of variances and the sum of covariances back into the expression for the total score variance $\\sigma_S^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_S^2 = k \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 + 2 \\left[ \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 \\left( \\bar{r} \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_S^2 = k \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 + k(k-1)\\bar{r} \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 $$\nFactoring out the common terms $k$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_S^2 = k \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 (1 + (k-1)\\bar{r}) $$\n\nWith this expression for $\\sigma_S^2$, we return to the definition of Cronbach's alpha:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_{X_i}^2}{\\sigma_S^2} \\right) = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{k \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2}{k \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2 (1 + (k-1)\\bar{r})} \\right) $$\nThe term $k \\sigma_{\\text{item}}^2$ cancels out, demonstrating that alpha is independent of the specific item variance as long as it is constant across items:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + (k-1)\\bar{r}} \\right) $$\nCombining the terms inside the parentheses:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( \\frac{1 + (k-1)\\bar{r} - 1}{1 + (k-1)\\bar{r}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( \\frac{(k-1)\\bar{r}}{1 + (k-1)\\bar{r}} \\right) $$\nThe $(k-1)$ terms cancel, yielding the final closed-form expression for Cronbach's alpha in terms of the number of items $k$ and the average inter-item correlation $\\bar{r}$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k\\bar{r}}{1 + (k-1)\\bar{r}} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $k=5$ items and an average inter-item correlation of $\\bar{r}=0.6$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{5 \\times 0.6}{1 + (5-1) \\times 0.6} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{3.0}{1 + 4 \\times 0.6} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{3}{1 + 2.4} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{3}{3.4} $$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $10$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{30}{34} $$\nReducing the fraction by dividing both parts by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{15}{17} $$\n\nFinally, we address whether this value is acceptable. The calculated value is $\\alpha = \\frac{15}{17} \\approx 0.882$. In psychometric research, particularly in the context of patient-reported outcomes, a commonly cited threshold for acceptable internal consistency for group-level comparisons is $\\alpha \\ge 0.70$. An alpha value greater than $0.80$ is typically considered \"good,\" and a value approaching $0.90$ is considered \"excellent.\" Therefore, a value of approximately $0.88$ indicates excellent internal consistency and is highly acceptable for group-level decision-making in patient-centered outcomes research.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{15}{17}} $$", "id": "5039324"}, {"introduction": "A central tenet of PCOR is ensuring that research findings are relevant to patients' lives.
