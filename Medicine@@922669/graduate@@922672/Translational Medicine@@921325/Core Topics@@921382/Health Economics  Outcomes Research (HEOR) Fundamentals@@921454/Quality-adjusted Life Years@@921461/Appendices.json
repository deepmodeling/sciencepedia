To evaluate the integral, we must split it at the point of discontinuity, $t_1$:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{t_1} u(t) \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{T} u(t) \\, dt $$\nSubstituting the constant values of $u(t)$ into the respective intervals yields:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{t_1} u_1 \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{T} u_2 \\, dt $$\nSince $u_1$ and $u_2$ are constants with respect to the integration variable $t$, they can be factored out of the integrals:\n$$ Q = u_1 \\int_{0}^{t_1} dt + u_2 \\int_{t_1}^{T} dt $$\nPerforming the integrations gives:\n$$ Q = u_1 [t]_{0}^{t_1} + u_2 [t]_{t_1}^{T} $$\n$$ Q = u_1 (t_1 - 0) + u_2 (T - t_1) $$\nThis leads to the final derived expression for the total QALYs for this piecewise-constant trajectory:\n$$ Q = u_1 t_1 + u_2 (T - t_1) $$\n**Interpretation**\nThis expression has a clear geometric interpretation as the area under the curve of the utility function $u(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$. It is the sum of the areas of two rectangles:\n1.  The first rectangle has a height of $u_1$ and a width of $t_1$. Its area is $u_1 t_1$, representing the QALYs accrued during the first, higher-utility phase.\n2.  The second rectangle has a height of $u_2$ and a width of $(T - t_1)$. Its area is $u_2(T - t_1)$, representing the QALYs accrued during the second, lower-utility phase.\nThus, the total QALYs are the sum of the utility values for each health state, each weighted by the duration of time spent in that state.

The calculated value of $1.465$ already consists of four significant figures ($1$, $4$, $6$, $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe total QALYs accrued by the patient over the $2$-year horizon is $1.465$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.465}\n$$", "id": "5053286"}, {"introduction": "Real-world medical interventions often create a trade-off between extending life and maintaining its quality, and their benefits unfold over many years.

The calculation must account for a baseline disease state with a time-varying utility and an adverse event (AE) that occurs for a specific duration. The core of the task is to select the correct method for adjusting the health utility for the AE, adhering strictly to the principle of not double-counting symptom effects.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the QALY calculation. The total evaluation horizon is $T=1$ year, which is equivalent to $52$ weeks. The QALY is defined as the integral of the utility function $u(t)$ over this period:\n$$Q = \\int_0^T u(t)\\,dt$$\nSince the utility is given as a piecewise constant function on a weekly basis, the integral can be calculated as a sum, where the time unit is years. For a period of $N$ weeks with constant utility $u$, the contribution to the total QALY is $u \\times \\frac{N}{52}$.\n$$Q = \\sum_{i} u_i \\cdot \\frac{N_i}{52}$$\nwhere $u_i$ is the constant utility over a period of $N_i$ weeks, and $\\sum_i N_i = 52$.\n\nLet's first establish the baseline annual QALY from the disease state utility, $u_D(t)$, without considering the AE.\nThe disease utility is given in three segments:\n1.  Weeks $1$–$12$ ($N_1 = 12$ weeks): $u_D(t) = 0.72$\n2.  Weeks $13$–$24$ ($N_2 = 12$ weeks): $u_D(t) = 0.78$\n3.  Weeks $25$–$52$ ($N_3 = 28$ weeks): $u_D(t) = 0.80$\n\nThe total annual QALY for the disease state alone, $Q_D$, would be:\n$$Q_D = \\frac{1}{52} \\left[ (12 \\times 0.72) + (12 \\times 0.78) + (28 \\times 0.80) \\right]$$\n$$Q_D = \\frac{1}{52} \\left[ 8.64 + 9.36 + 22.4 \\right] = \\frac{40.4}{52} \\approx 0.776923$$\n\nNext, we must account for the adverse event (AE). The AE occurs from week $9$ to week $20$, a total duration of $20 - 9 + 1 = 12$ weeks. This AE introduces nausea and worsens fatigue. The critical step is to determine the correct utility decrement to apply during this period.\n\nThe problem provides two sets of disutility values:\n1.  **MAUI within-instrument decrements:** $\\Delta u_F = 0.03$ for the worsening of fatigue and $\\Delta u_N = 0.05$ for the introduction of nausea. These values represent the change in utility as measured by the same instrument used to determine the baseline disease utility, $u_D(t)$.\n2.  **Population-based disutilities:** $0.04$ for fatigue and $0.06$ for nausea, from a separate publication and estimated in \"otherwise healthy individuals.\"\n\nThe guiding principle is to avoid \"double counting.\" The baseline disease utility, $u_D(t)$, was measured with the MAUI, which already includes fatigue as a domain. Therefore, the baseline utility score already reflects the disutility of having moderate fatigue due to the disease. To apply an external, population-based disutility for \"fatigue\" (value of $0.04$) on top of this would be incorrect, as it would count the impact of fatigue twice: once in the baseline $u_D(t)$ and again as a separate decrement.\n\nThe correct approach is to use the within-instrument decrements provided by the MAUI. These values are designed to measure the *incremental* change in health state. $\\Delta u_F = 0.03$ is the specific utility loss from the fatigue worsening from \"moderate\" to \"severe.\" $\\Delta u_N = 0.05$ is the utility loss from \"none\" to \"moderate\" nausea. These are additive because they affect different health domains (or are specified as separate decrements). The total weekly utility decrement during the AE is:\n$$\\Delta u_{AE} = \\Delta u_F + \\Delta u_N = 0.03 + 0.05 = 0.08$$\n\nNow we apply this decrement to the utility function during the AE period (weeks $9$–$20$). This period spans two different baseline utility segments:\n-   **Weeks $9$–$12$ (4 weeks):** The baseline utility is $u_D(t) = 0.72$. The adjusted utility is $u(t) = 0.72 - 0.08 = 0.64$.\n-   **Weeks $13$–$20$ (8 weeks):** The baseline utility is $u_D(t) = 0.78$. The adjusted utility is $u(t) = 0.78 - 0.08 = 0.70$.\n\nWe can now calculate the final annual QALY by constructing the complete piecewise utility function for the year:\n-   Weeks $1$–$8$ ($8$ weeks): $u(t) = 0.72$\n-   Weeks $9$–$12$ ($4$ weeks): $u(t) = 0.64$\n-   Weeks $13$–$20$ ($8$ weeks): $u(t) = 0.70$\n-   Weeks $21$–$24$ ($4$ weeks): $u(t) = 0.78$\n-   Weeks $25$–$52$ ($28$ weeks): $u(t) = 0.80$\n\nThe total QALY is:\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{52} \\left[ (8 \\times 0.72) + (4 \\times 0.64) + (8 \\times 0.70) + (4 \\times 0.78) + (28 \\times 0.80) \\right]$$\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{52} \\left[ 5.76 + 2.56 + 5.60 + 3.12 + 22.40 \\right]$$\n$$Q = \\frac{39.44}{52} \\approx 0.7584615...$$\nRounding to four decimal places gives $0.7585$ QALYs.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. $0.7538$ QALYs, computed by subtracting the published AE disutilities $0.04$ (fatigue) and $0.06$ (nausea) from the disease utility during weeks $9$–$20$.**\nThis option uses the population-based disutilities.

The method is conceptually sound as it measures the *incremental* impact of the AE using decrements from the same measurement system (MAUI), thereby avoiding double counting. This aligns perfectly with best practices in health utility assessment and the explicit instructions of the problem.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. $0.7654$ QALYs, computed by only subtracting $\\Delta u_N = 0.05$ for nausea during weeks $9$–$20$ and leaving fatigue unchanged, because fatigue is already part of the disease utility.**\nThis option attempts to avoid double counting by completely ignoring the change in fatigue. The decrement used is only $\\Delta u = \\Delta u_N = 0.05$.\n-   Weeks $9$–$12$: $u(t) = 0.72 - 0.05 = 0.67$.\n-   Weeks $13$–$20$: $u(t) = 0.78 - 0.05 = 0.73$.\nThe total QALY calculation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{52} \\left[ (8 \\times 0.72) + (4 \\times 0.67) + (8 \\times 0.73) + (4 \\times 0.78) + (28 \\times 0.80) \\right]$$\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{52} \\left[ 5.76 + 2.68 + 5.84 + 3.12 + 22.40 \\right] = \\frac{39.8}{52} \\approx 0.76538...$$\nThe calculation is numerically correct for the stated method. However, the reasoning is incorrect. While fatigue is part of the disease, the AE *worsens* it. The MAUI decrement $\\Delta u_F = 0.03$ correctly quantifies the utility loss associated with this *worsening*, not with having fatigue in the first place. Ignoring this change understates the negative impact of the AE. It is a misapplication of the double-counting principle.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. $0.7629$ QALYs, computed by applying a multiplicative $8\\%$ proportional reduction to disease utility during weeks $9$–$20$ to reflect the combined AE disutility.**\nThis option proposes a multiplicative model. The $8\\%$ reduction likely comes from $\\Delta u_F + \\Delta u_N = 0.03 + 0.05 = 0.08$. The utility is multiplied by $(1-0.08) = 0.92$.\n-   Weeks $9$–$12$: $u(t) = 0.72 \\times 0.92 = 0.6624$.\n-   Weeks $13$–$20$: $u(t) = 0.78 \\times 0.92 = 0.7176$.\nThe total QALY calculation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{52} \\left[ (8 \\times 0.72) + (4 \\times 0.6624) + (8 \\times 0.7176) + (4 \\times 0.78) + (28 \\times 0.80) \\right]$$\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{52} \\left[ 5.76 + 2.6496 + 5.7408 + 3.12 + 22.40 \\right] = \\frac{39.6704}{52} \\approx 0.76289...$$\nThe calculation is numerically correct for the stated method. However, the method itself is not standard unless specified by the utility instrument's properties. Multi-attribute utility instruments are typically based on an additive model where decrements are subtracted. Applying a multiplicative model is an ad-hoc choice that assumes the disutility of an AE is proportional to the baseline health state, which is a different theoretical assumption. The standard and most direct interpretation of utility decrements is additive subtraction.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5053247"}]}
