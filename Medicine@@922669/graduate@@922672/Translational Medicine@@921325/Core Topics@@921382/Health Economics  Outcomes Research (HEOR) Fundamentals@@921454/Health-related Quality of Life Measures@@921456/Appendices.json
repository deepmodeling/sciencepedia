The instrument consists of $10$ items, each scored on a $5$-category Likert scale from $0$ (worst functioning) to $4$ (best functioning). Items are intended to measure a single physical functioning construct but were developed to cover two content subdomains: mobility (items $1$–$5$) and self-care (items $6$–$10$). From a large baseline cohort ($N \\gg 1000$), the team computed the item-level variances and covariances using Pearson moments on the raw scores. Assume these are stable population estimates and that missing data are negligible.\n\nThe estimated item variances are:\n- item $1$: $1.1$\n- item $2$: $0.9$\n- item $3$: $1.0$\n- item $4$: $1.2$\n- item $5$: $0.8$\n- item $6$: $1.1$\n- item $7$: $1.0$\n- item $8$: $0.9$\n- item $9$: $1.3$\n- item $10$: $1.0$\n\nThe estimated pairwise covariances follow a simple, content-structured pattern that is consistent with the instrument design:\n- For any pair of items within the same subdomain (both in $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ or both in $\\{6,7,8,9,10\\}$), the covariance is $0.35$.\n- For any pair of items across different subdomains (one in $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and one in $\\{6,7,8,9,10\\}$), the covariance is $0.20$.\n\nUsing only these item-level variances and covariances, compute the internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) for the $10$-item total score.

Do not include any unit. For interpretation, treat values $\\ge 0.70$ as adequate.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in psychometric theory, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the internal consistency of a $10$-item scale using Cronbach's alpha, denoted by $\\alpha$. The formula for Cronbach's alpha is given by:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i^2}{\\sigma_T^2} \\right) $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of items, $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i^2$ is the sum of the individual item variances, and $\\sigma_T^2$ is the variance of the total score.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the number of items is $k=10$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the item variances, $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i^2$. The variances for the $10$ items are given as $1.1$, $0.9$, $1.0$, $1.2$, $0.8$, $1.1$, $1.0$, $0.9$, $1.3$, and $1.0$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sigma_i^2 = 1.1 + 0.9 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 0.8 + 1.1 + 1.0 + 0.9 + 1.3 + 1.0 = 10.3 $$\n\nNext, we must compute the variance of the total score, $\\sigma_T^2$. The total score, $T$, is the sum of the scores of the individual items, $X_i$, such that $T = \\sum_{i=1}^k X_i$. The variance of this sum is the sum of all elements in the $k \\times k$ covariance matrix of the items. This can be expressed as the sum of the variances (the diagonal elements of the matrix) and the sum of all covariances (the off-diagonal elements):\n$$ \\sigma_T^2 = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i^2 + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\sigma_{ij} $$\nThe sum of covariances $\\sum_{i \\neq j} \\sigma_{ij}$ includes each pair twice (i.e., $\\sigma_{ij}$ and $\\sigma_{ji}$). Since $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$, this is equivalent to $2 \\sum_{i < j} \\sigma_{ij}$.\n\nTo calculate this sum, we must count the number of covariance pairs according to the specified subdomain structure. The instrument has two subdomains of $5$ items each: mobility (items $1$–$5$) and self-care (items $6$–$10$).\n\n1.  Number of pairs within the mobility subdomain: The number of unique pairs from a set of $5$ items is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{2}$.\n    $$ \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10 $$\n    The covariance for each of these pairs is given as $0.35$. The sum of these covariances is $10 \\times 0.35 = 3.5$.\n\n2.  Number of pairs within the self-care subdomain: Similarly, for the $5$ items in this subdomain, there are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ unique pairs.\n    The covariance for each pair is also $0.35$. The sum of these covariances is $10 \\times 0.35 = 3.5$.\n\n3.  Number of pairs across different subdomains: This is the number of pairs formed by selecting one item from the $5$ mobility items and one from the $5$ self-care items.\n    The number of such pairs is $5 \\times 5 = 25$.\n    The covariance for each of these pairs is given as $0.20$. The sum of these covariances is $25 \\times 0.20 = 5.0$.\n\nThe total sum of all unique pairwise covariances, $\\sum_{i < j} \\sigma_{ij}$, is the sum of the amounts from these three cases:\n$$ \\sum_{i < j} \\sigma_{ij} = 3.5 + 3.5 + 5.0 = 12.0 $$\nThe sum of all off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix is therefore:\n$$ \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\sigma_{ij} = 2 \\sum_{i < j} \\sigma_{ij} = 2 \\times 12.0 = 24.0 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the total score variance, $\\sigma_T^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_T^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sigma_i^2 + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\sigma_{ij} = 10.3 + 24.0 = 34.3 $$\n\nWith all components determined, we substitute them into the formula for Cronbach's alpha:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i^2}{\\sigma_T^2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{10}{10-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{10.3}{34.3} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{10}{9} \\left( \\frac{34.3 - 10.3}{34.3} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{10}{9} \\left( \\frac{24.0}{34.3} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{240}{308.7} \\approx 0.777453838... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 0.7775 $$\n\nFinally, we must assess whether the internal consistency is adequate based on the provided criterion of $\\alpha \\ge 0.70$. Since our calculated value is $\\alpha \\approx 0.7775$, which is greater than $0.70$, the scale's internal consistency is deemed adequate for its intended use in group-level research.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7775}$$", "id": "5019612"}, {"introduction": "Once an instrument's reliability is confirmed, the next step is to translate its descriptive output into a quantitative value for analysis.

Following the structure described:\n1.  If the state is not $1$-$1$-$1$-$1$-$1$, the intercept decrement $d_{0}$ is applied.\n2.  For each dimension $i$ with a level $\\ell_i > 1$, the corresponding decrement $d_{i}^{(\\ell_i)}$ is added.\n3.  If any dimension is at level $3$, the penalty $\\pi$ is applied.\n\nLet's formalize this. Let $\\mathbf{1}$ be the vector $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$ representing full health. Let $I(\\cdot)$ be the indicator function, which is $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise. The total decrement for a state $\\ell$ is:\n$$D(\\ell) = d_{0} \\cdot I(\\ell \\ne \\mathbf{1}) + \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\text{MO,SC,UA,PD,AD}\\}} d_{i}^{(\\ell_i)} \\cdot I(\\ell_i > 1) + \\pi \\cdot I(\\exists i: \\ell_i = 3)$$\nNote that the problem defines decrements only for levels $2$ and $3$, which is consistent with the term $I(\\ell_i > 1)$, as the implicit decrement for level $1$ is $0$.\n\nThe specific health state to be evaluated is $1$-$2$-$3$-$2$-$1$.

Therefore, the intercept decrement $d_{0}$ applies.\n-   **Dimension/Level Decrements**: We sum the decrements for each dimension where the level is greater than $1$:\n    -   Mobility (MO) is at level $1$: decrement is $0$.\n    -   Self-Care (SC) is at level $2$: decrement is $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)}$.\n    -   Usual Activities (UA) is at level $3$: decrement is $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)}$.\n    -   Pain/Discomfort (PD) is at level $2$: decrement is $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)}$.\n    -   Anxiety/Depression (AD) is at level $1$: decrement is $0$.\n-   **Penalty**: The state vector contains a level $3$ (for Usual Activities, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{UA}}=3$). Therefore, the penalty $\\pi$ applies.\n\nThe total decrement $D(\\ell^{*})$ is the sum of these components:\n$$D(\\ell^{*}) = d_{0} + d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)} + d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)} + d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)} + \\pi$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the coefficients:\n-   $d_{0} = 0.081$\n-   $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)} = 0.104$\n-   $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)} = 0.094$\n-   $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)} = 0.123$\n-   $\\pi = 0.269$\n\nSumming these values:\n$$D(\\ell^{*}) = 0.081 + 0.104 + 0.094 + 0.123 + 0.269$$\n$$D(\\ell^{*}) = 0.671$$\nThe utility $U(\\ell^{*})$ is then calculated as:\n$$U(\\ell^{*}) = 1 - D(\\ell^{*}) = 1 - 0.671 = 0.329$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.329$ has three significant figures. To express it with four, we append a zero.\n$$U(\\ell^{*}) \\approx 0.3290$$\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation if the result is negative. Since the calculated utility of $0.3290$ is positive, it falls between dead ($U=0$) and full health ($U=1$). This means the health state $1$-$2$-$3$-$2$-$1$ is considered better than being dead.

Interpret Cost-Effectiveness:**\nAn intervention is considered cost-effective if its ICER is less than or equal to the decision-maker's willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold.\n\n- **At a WTP threshold of $\\$50,000$ per QALY:**\nSince $\\text{ICER} = \\$80,000 > WTP = \\$50,000$, the New Intervention would **not** be considered cost-effective at this threshold. The cost to gain one QALY is higher than what the system is willing to pay.\n\n- **At a WTP threshold of $\\$100,000$ per QALY:**\nSince $\\text{ICER} = \\$80,000 \\le WTP = \\$100,000$, the New Intervention **would** be considered cost-effective at this threshold. The cost to gain one QALY is within the acceptable range.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the ICER rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $80,000$. To represent this quantity unambiguously with three significant figures, scientific notation is appropriate.\n$$ 80,000 = 8.00 \\times 10^4 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.00 \\times 10^4}$$", "id": "5019538"}]}
