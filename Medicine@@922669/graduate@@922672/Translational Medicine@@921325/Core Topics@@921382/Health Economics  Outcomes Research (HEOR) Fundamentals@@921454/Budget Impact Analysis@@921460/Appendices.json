It presents a standard epidemiological cascade model used in health technology assessment, specifically for budget impact analysis. The variables are defined as conditional probabilities, which is a standard and rigorous approach. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a straightforward application of probability theory to a real-world scenario in translational medicine.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the expected number, $N$, of patients who are both diagnosed and eligible for the new therapy. According to the principle provided in the problem statement, this can be expressed as:\n$$\nN = Pop \\times P(\\text{Eligible and Diagnosed})\n$$\nWe need to determine the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population is both eligible and diagnosed. Let us define the sequence of events for a randomly selected individual:\n\n1.  Event $D$: The individual has the disease.\n2.  Event $Dx$: The individual is correctly diagnosed with the disease.\n3.  Event $E$: The individual is eligible for the therapy.\n\nThe given parameters can be formally expressed as probabilities:\n-   The probability of having the disease is the prevalence: $P(D) = Prev$.\n-   The probability of being diagnosed, given that one has the disease, is $dx$: $P(Dx | D) = dx$.\n-   The probability of being eligible, given that one has been diagnosed, is $elig$. Since the model assumes correct diagnosis, a diagnosed individual must have the disease. Therefore, the conditioning event is \"diagnosed and has the disease\", which is $Dx \\cap D$. Thus, $P(E | Dx \\cap D) = elig$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of patients who are eligible and diagnosed. In this model's cascade ($D \\to Dx \\to E$), an eligible patient must have been diagnosed, and a diagnosed patient must have the disease. Therefore, the target group consists of individuals for whom events $D$, $Dx$, and $E$ have all occurred. The probability we seek is the joint probability $P(D \\cap Dx \\cap E)$.\n\nUsing the chain rule of probability, we can write:\n$$\nP(D \\cap Dx \\cap E) = P(E | D \\cap Dx) \\times P(D \\cap Dx)\n$$\nWe can further expand the term $P(D \\cap Dx)$ using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\nP(D \\cap Dx) = P(Dx | D) \\times P(D)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the first equation, we get the full expression for the joint probability:\n$$\nP(D \\cap Dx \\cap E) = P(E | D \\cap Dx) \\times P(Dx | D) \\times P(D)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the problem's variable definitions into this formal expression:\n-   $P(D) = Prev$\n-   $P(Dx | D) = dx$\n-   $P(E | D \\cap Dx) = elig$\n\nThis yields the probability that a randomly selected individual belongs to the target patient group:\n$$\nP(\\text{Eligible and Diagnosed}) = P(D \\cap Dx \\cap E) = Prev \\times dx \\times elig\n$$\nThe expected number of such patients, $N$, in a population of size $Pop$ is then given by:\n$$\nN = Pop \\times Prev \\times dx \\times elig\n$$\nThis is the general expression for $N$.\n\n### Calculation\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n-   $Pop = 2,000,000$\n-   $Prev = 0.02$\n-   $dx = 0.6$\n-   $elig = 0.5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nN = 2,000,000 \\times 0.02 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.5\n$$\nWe can perform the multiplication step-by-step to represent the patient cascade:\nThe expected number of diseased individuals in the population is:\n$$\nN_{D} = Pop \\times Prev = 2,000,000 \\times 0.02 = 40,000\n$$\nAmong these diseased individuals, the expected number who are correctly diagnosed is:\n$$\nN_{Dx} = N_{D} \\times dx = 40,000 \\times 0.6 = 24,000\n$$\nFinally, among these diagnosed individuals, the expected number who are eligible for the therapy is:\n$$\nN = N_{Dx} \\times elig = 24,000 \\times 0.5 = 12,000\n$$\nThis confirms the result of the combined formula:\n$$\nN = 2,000,000 \\times (0.02 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.5) = 2,000,000 \\times (0.02 \\times 0.3) = 2,000,000 \\times 0.006 = 12,000\n$$\nThe expected number of eligible, diagnosed patients is $12,000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12,000}$$", "id": "4995740"}, {"introduction": "The introduction of a new diagnostic test requires an analysis that goes beyond its purchase price, focusing instead on the economic consequences of its performance.
