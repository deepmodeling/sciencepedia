The field of pharmacokinetics (PK) provides the tools to describe this macroscopic journey, and a key metric is the steady-state area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC_{\\tau,ss}$). This value represents the total drug exposure over a dosing interval and is fundamental for designing dosing regimens that balance efficacy and toxicity. This practice [@problem_id:5030026] will guide you through deriving this crucial PK parameter from the first principle of mass balance, applying it to a clinically relevant ADC scenario.", "problem": "A biotechnology team is developing an Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC), where ADC refers to an antibody covalently linked to a cytotoxic payload. The ADC has an average Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR) of $4$ at release. In a first-in-human study, the ADC is administered by intravenous infusion with complete bioavailability ($F=1$), using a dosing regimen of $3 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ every three weeks ($q3w$) to a $70 \\,\\mathrm{kg}$ patient. The systemic clearance of the conjugated antibody (measured as total antibody) is determined to be $0.3 \\,\\mathrm{L/day}$ under conditions where pharmacokinetics are linear and time-invariant.\n\nStarting from fundamental pharmacokinetic mass balance and the definition of clearance, derive the steady-state area under the plasma concentration–time curve over one dosing interval for the conjugated antibody, and compute its value. Express your final answer in $\\mathrm{mg\\cdot day/L}$ and round to four significant figures. Do not include units in the final boxed answer. Clearly state any assumptions used, and briefly justify whether the DAR value enters the steady-state area under the curve calculation under the stated conditions.", "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in fundamental pharmacokinetic principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the steady-state area under the plasma concentration–time curve over one dosing interval ($AUC_{\\tau,ss}$). The derivation starts from the principle of mass balance for a drug administered in a multiple-dose regimen at steady state.\n\nAt steady state, the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination when averaged over one dosing interval, $\\tau$. This means the total amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation during one interval is equal to the total amount of drug eliminated from the body over that same interval.\n\nThe amount of drug administered and becoming systemically available in one interval is given by the product of the bioavailability, $F$, and the dose, $D$.\n$$ \\text{Amount Administered} = F \\cdot D $$\nThe problem states that the drug is administered via intravenous infusion with complete bioavailability, so $F=1$. Therefore, the amount entering the systemic circulation is simply the dose, $D$.\n\nThe instantaneous rate of elimination of a drug from the body is defined by the product of its systemic clearance, $CL$, and its plasma concentration, $C(t)$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) = CL \\cdot C(t) $$\nThe total amount of drug eliminated over one dosing interval at steady state is the integral of this rate from the beginning to the end of the interval (e.g., from time $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$ within a steady-state cycle).\n$$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} CL \\cdot C_{ss}(t) \\, dt $$\nThe problem specifies that the pharmacokinetics are linear, which implies that the clearance, $CL$, is a constant and does not depend on the drug concentration. Thus, $CL$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = CL \\cdot \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) \\, dt $$\nThe integral term, $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) \\, dt$, is the definition of the area under the concentration-time curve over one dosing interval at steady state, denoted as $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$.\n$$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = CL \\cdot AUC_{\\tau,ss} $$\nBy equating the amount administered to the amount eliminated at steady state:\n$$ F \\cdot D = CL \\cdot AUC_{\\tau,ss} $$\nWith $F=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ D = CL \\cdot AUC_{\\tau,ss} $$\nSolving for $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$, we obtain the fundamental equation for its calculation:\n$$ AUC_{\\tau,ss} = \\frac{D}{CL} $$\nNext, we calculate the values for $D$ and $CL$ from the problem statement.\n\nThe dose, $D$, is based on a dosing regimen of $3 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ for a patient with a weight, $W$, of $70 \\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$ D = 3 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 70 \\,\\mathrm{kg} = 210 \\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe systemic clearance, $CL$, of the conjugated antibody is given as:\n$$ CL = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{L/day} $$\nIt is assumed that both the dose and the clearance parameter refer to the same molecular species, which is the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) as a whole.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the derived equation to compute $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$:\n$$ AUC_{\\tau,ss} = \\frac{210 \\,\\mathrm{mg}}{0.3 \\,\\mathrm{L/day}} = 700 \\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot day/L} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $700$ with four significant figures, we write it as $700.0$.\n$$ AUC_{\\tau,ss} = 700.0 \\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot day/L} $$\nFinally, we must address whether the Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR) of $4$ enters the calculation.\n\nUnder the stated conditions, the calculation of $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$ is based on the ratio of the total administered dose, $D$, to the systemic clearance, $CL$. The dose ($210 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$) and clearance ($0.3 \\,\\mathrm{L/day}$) are provided as bulk properties of the ADC as a whole. Consequently, the DAR value does not appear as an explicit variable in the final calculation formula, $AUC_{\\tau,ss} = D/CL$.\n\nHowever, the DAR is a critical molecular attribute that influences the ADC's physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity, size, charge), which in turn directly impact its pharmacokinetic behavior, including its rate of clearance. The provided value of $CL = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{L/day}$ is specific to this particular ADC with an average DAR of $4$. An ADC with a different DAR would likely exhibit a different clearance value. Therefore, the DAR is implicitly accounted for within the given numerical value of $CL$, but it is not an independent variable required for the calculation itself when $D$ and $CL$ are given.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{700.0}$$", "id": "5030026"}, {"introduction": "Systemic drug exposure, as quantified by metrics like $AUC$, is only the first part of the story. For an ADC to be effective, it must reach its target on tumor cells and engage it sufficiently. This exercise bridges the gap between pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug) and pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) by focusing on Receptor Occupancy (RO).

Assume that antibody-receptor binding kinetics are fast relative to the dosing interval so that quasi-equilibrium holds at trough, and that the total receptor concentration in the tumor interstitium is much smaller than the free antibody concentration, consistent with some tumor receptor densities (for example, $10^{5}$ receptors per cell and $10^{6}$ cells per $\\mathrm{mL}$ correspond to approximately $0.17\\,\\mathrm{nM}$), thereby justifying the approximation that free antibody concentration is well-approximated by the measured $C_{\\text{trough}}$ at trough. A translational pharmacology model indicates that a minimum trough Receptor Occupancy of $0.70$ is required to achieve efficacy.\n\nStarting only from the Law of Mass Action and conservation of receptors, derive an expression for the Receptor Occupancy at trough as a function of free antibody concentration and $K_{D}$ under the stated assumptions.

The translational efficacy threshold is $0.70$, and $0.8000 > 0.70$, so the calculated trough Receptor Occupancy meets the stated minimum requirement for efficacy.\n\nJustification of approximations: The derivation assumes (i) rapid binding kinetics relative to the dosing interval so that quasi-equilibrium holds at trough. For typical immunoglobulin G interactions, the association rate constant $k_{\\text{on}}$ and dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$ satisfy $K_{D} = k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$, yielding binding/unbinding half-times on the order of minutes to hours, which are much shorter than the three-week interval, supporting equilibrium at trough. (ii) The free antibody concentration is approximated by the measured $C_{\\text{trough}}$. This approximation holds because the total receptor concentration in the tumor interstitium is assumed to be small relative to the free antibody concentration, minimizing \"ligand depletion.\" As the problem's example illustrates, a receptor concentration of approximately $0.17\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ is negligible compared to the $2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ antibody trough concentration, so ligand depletion is minimal and the approximation $[A] \\approx C_{\\text{trough}}$ holds.
