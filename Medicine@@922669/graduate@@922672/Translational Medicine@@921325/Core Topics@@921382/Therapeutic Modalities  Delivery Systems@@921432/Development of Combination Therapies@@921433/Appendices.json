The experimental setup described is a standard microdilution checkerboard assay, a fundamental technique in microbiology and pharmacology. The appropriate index is the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index, commonly denoted as FICI.\n\nFirst, we must define the terms based on the provided information.\nThe Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of a drug is its lowest concentration that prevents visible growth.\nLet $\\mathrm{MIC_A}$ be the MIC of drug A when used alone.\nLet $\\mathrm{MIC_B}$ be the MIC of drug B when used alone.\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$\\mathrm{MIC_A} = 1 \\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n$\\mathrm{MIC_B} = 2 \\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n\nWhen used in combination, a different set of concentrations achieves the same inhibitory endpoint.\nLet $\\mathrm{C_A}$ be the concentration of drug A in the combination that results in inhibition.\nLet $\\mathrm{C_B}$ be the concentration of drug B in the combination that results in inhibition.\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$\\mathrm{C_A} = 0.25 \\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n$\\mathrm{C_B} = 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n\nThe Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) for each drug represents the fraction of its own MIC that is present in the inhibitory combination.

Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is a binary event at the patient level. Let $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},A}$ denote the monotherapy probability of DLT for drug $A$, and let $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},B}$ denote the monotherapy probability of DLT for drug $B$.

No rounding is required and no units should be used.", "solution": "The task is divided into three parts. We will address each in sequence.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the expected probability of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) for the combination of drugs $A$ and $B$ under the assumption of independence, denoted as $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}}$.\n\nLet $E_A$ be the event that a patient experiences DLT from drug $A$. The probability of this event is given as $P(E_A) = p_{\\mathrm{DLT},A}$.\nLet $E_B$ be the event that a patient experiences DLT from drug $B$. The probability of this event is given as $P(E_B) = p_{\\mathrm{DLT},B}$.\n\nA DLT for the combination therapy occurs if a patient experiences a DLT from drug $A$, or from drug $B$, or from both. This corresponds to the union of the events $E_A$ and $E_B$. Thus, the probability we seek to derive is $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}} = P(E_A \\cup E_B)$.\n\nFrom the fundamental axioms of probability, specifically the inclusion-exclusion principle for two events, we have:\n$$P(E_A \\cup E_B) = P(E_A) + P(E_B) - P(E_A \\cap E_B)$$\nHere, $P(E_A \\cap E_B)$ is the probability that a patient experiences DLT from both drug $A$ and drug $B$.\n\nThe problem states that the mechanisms by which drugs $A$ and $B$ cause DLT are independent. By the definition of statistical independence for two events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(E_A \\cap E_B) = P(E_A) \\times P(E_B)$$\n\nSubstituting the independence condition into the inclusion-exclusion principle gives the desired expression for $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}} = P(E_A \\cup E_B) = P(E_A) + P(E_B) - P(E_A)P(E_B)$$\nIn the notation of the problem statement, this is:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}} = p_{\\mathrm{DLT},A} + p_{\\mathrm{DLT},B} - p_{\\mathrm{DLT},A} p_{\\mathrm{DLT},B}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical value of $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}}$ using the given monotherapy probabilities.\nWe are given:\n$p_{\\mathrm{DLT},A} = 0.2$\n$p_{\\mathrm{DLT},B} = 0.25$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}} = 0.2 + 0.25 - (0.2)(0.25)$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}} = 0.45 - 0.05$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}} = 0.4$$\nThus, the expected probability of DLT for the combination, assuming independent toxicity mechanisms, is $0.4$.\n\nThird, we compute the Bliss Independence (BI) interaction excess for toxicity, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Bliss}}$, and provide a clinical interpretation.\n\nThe value $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Bliss}}$ is defined as the difference between the observed combination DLT probability, $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{obs}}$, and the expected probability under independence, $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}}$:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}}$$\nWe are given $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.5$ and we have calculated $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}} = 0.4$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1$$\n\nThe clinical interpretation of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Bliss}}$ depends on its sign and magnitude.\n1.  Sign: In this case, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = 0.1$ is positive. A positive value implies that $p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{obs}} > p_{\\mathrm{DLT},AB}^{\\mathrm{ind}}$. The observed toxicity of the combination is greater than the toxicity predicted if the two drugs acted independently. This phenomenon is termed supra-additivity or synergistic toxicity. The assumption of independent toxicity mechanisms is invalidated by the clinical data.\n2.  Magnitude: The magnitude of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = 0.1$ indicates that the combination therapy results in DLTs in an additional $10\\%$ of the patient population compared to the expectation from independence. This is a clinically significant increase in toxicity.\n3.  Mechanistic Reasoning: From a mechanistic standpoint, supra-additive toxicity suggests a detrimental drug-drug interaction. This could occur through various biological mechanisms, such as:\n    *   Pharmacokinetic interaction: One drug may inhibit the metabolism or clearance of the other, leading to increased exposure and consequently greater toxicity.\n    *   Pharmacodynamic interaction: The drugs may target different nodes in a critical cellular pathway (e.g., cell survival or apoptosis). The damage caused by one drug may sensitize the cells or organism to the toxic effects of the second drug, leading to a combined effect that is greater than the sum of the parts.\nIn the context of combination therapy development, a finding of significant supra-additive toxicity is a major safety signal that can limit further dose escalation and may jeopardize the viability of the combination regimen.\n\nIn summary, the calculated value $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = 0.1$ indicates a clinically meaningful supra-additive toxic interaction between drugs $A$ and $B$, which contradicts the initial hypothesis of independent toxicity mechanisms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1}$$", "id": "5008734"}]}
