The given values are realistic and all necessary information is provided. The problem is valid.\n\n### Derivations\nLet $N(t)$ represent the number of radiopharmaceutical molecules within the tumor at time $t$. The problem states that the change in $N(t)$ is governed by two independent, first-order processes: physical decay and biological clearance.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Effective Decay Constant ($\\lambda_{\\text{eff}}$)**\n\nThe fundamental definition of a first-order process is that the rate of change of the quantity is directly proportional to the quantity itself.\n\nThe rate of change of $N(t)$ due to physical radioactive decay is:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt}_{\\text{phys}} = -\\lambda_{\\text{phys}} N(t) $$\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\text{phys}}$ is the physical decay constant.\n\nThe rate of change of $N(t)$ due to biological clearance is:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt}_{\\text{bio}} = -\\lambda_{\\text{bio}} N(t) $$\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\text{bio}}$ is the biological clearance constant.\n\nSince the two processes are independent, their rates are additive. The total rate of change of $N(t)$ is the sum of the rates of the individual processes:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{dN}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{phys}} + \\left(\\frac{dN}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{bio}} = -\\lambda_{\\text{phys}} N(t) - \\lambda_{\\text{bio}} N(t) $$\nFactoring out $N(t)$, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -(\\lambda_{\\text{phys}} + \\lambda_{\\text{bio}}) N(t) $$\nThis equation has the form of a single first-order decay process, $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda_{\\text{eff}} N(t)$.
