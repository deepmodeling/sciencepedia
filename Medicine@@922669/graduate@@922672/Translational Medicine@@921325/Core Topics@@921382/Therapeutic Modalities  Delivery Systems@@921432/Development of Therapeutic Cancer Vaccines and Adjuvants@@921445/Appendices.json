Use the following foundational constructs: the tumor purity $p$ is the fraction of cancer-derived cells in the sample, the normal compartment has diploid copy number $C_{n} = 2$, each locus in the tumor has a locus-specific total copy number $C_{t}$, and a given mutation is present on $m$ of the $C_{t}$ tumor copies in a fraction $f$ of cancer cells, where $f$ is the cancer cell fraction (CCF). The Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) is the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the mutation at that locus.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the assumption of proportional sampling of chromosomal copies from a tumor-normal mixture, derive a formula for the expected VAF in terms of $p$, $C_{t}$, $C_{n}$, $m$, and $f$, and then invert it to obtain an estimator for $f$ based on an observed $VAF$.\n\nYou are given the following patient-specific parameters and locus-level measurements:\n- Tumor purity $p = 0.70$ and average tumor ploidy $\\Pi = 3.0$ (the average ploidy is provided for context; use the locus-specific copy numbers $C_{t}$ for calculations).\n- Four somatic mutations, each accompanied by a predicted vaccine neoepitope with binding weight $w_{i}$ (a dimensionless quantity proportional to predicted T-cell priming probability in the absence of adjuvant).
