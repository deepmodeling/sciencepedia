The dynamics of the bacterial population, $\\dot{N}(t) = \\frac{dN}{dt}$, are determined by two processes: growth and phage-induced lysis.\n\n1.  Bacterial Growth: In the absence of phages, the bacterial population grows exponentially. The per-capita growth rate is given as $r$. This contributes a positive term to the rate of change, proportional to the current bacterial density $N(t)$. The growth term is thus $+rN(t)$.\n\n2.  Bacterial Loss due to Phage Adsorption: Phage adsorption to bacteria is assumed to follow mass-action kinetics. The rate of interactions between phages and bacteria is proportional to the product of their densities, $N(t)P(t)$. The proportionality constant is the adsorption rate constant, $\\phi$. Each adsorption event leads to the lysis and death of the bacterium. This contributes a negative term to the rate of change. The loss term is thus $-\\phi N(t)P(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for the bacterial density is:\n$$ \\dot{N}(t) = rN(t) - \\phi N(t)P(t) $$\n\nThe dynamics of the free phage population, $\\dot{P}(t) = \\frac{dP}{dt}$, are determined by phage replication from bacterial lysis and natural clearance or inactivation.\n\n1.  Phage Production: Each successful adsorption event, occurring at a rate of $\\phi N(t)P(t)$, results in a net contribution of $\\beta$ new phage particles. This means that for every interaction, the phage population increases by $\\beta$ particles. This contributes a positive term to the rate of change. The production term is thus $+\\beta \\phi N(t)P(t)$. The wording \"net contribution\" implies that the loss of the single phage particle that initiated the infection is already accounted for in the parameter $\\beta$.\n\n2.  Phage Clearance: Free phages are cleared from the system or become inactive at a per-capita rate $d$. This contributes a negative term proportional to the current phage density $P(t)$. The clearance term is thus $-dP(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for the free phage density is:\n$$ \\dot{P}(t) = \\beta \\phi N(t)P(t) - dP(t) $$\n\nTherefore, the minimal mass-action dynamical system is:\n$$ \\dot{N}(t) = N(t)(r - \\phi P(t)) $$\n$$ \\dot{P}(t) = P(t)(\\beta \\phi N(t) - d) $$\n\n(b) Derivation of the instantaneous bacterial clearance threshold, $P_c$.\n\nThe instantaneous bacterial clearance threshold, $P_c$, is defined as the minimal initial free phage density, which we denote as $P(0)$, such that the initial net rate of change of the bacterial population is negative. The initial conditions are given as $N(0) = N_0$, where $N_0 > 0$.\n\nThe condition for the bacterial population to begin decreasing at time $t=0$ is:\n$$ \\dot{N}(0) < 0 $$\n\nUsing the equation for $\\dot{N}(t)$ derived in part (a), we evaluate it at $t=0$:\n$$ \\dot{N}(0) = rN(0) - \\phi N(0)P(0) $$\n\nSubstituting the initial condition $N(0) = N_0$:\n$$ \\dot{N}(0) = rN_0 - \\phi N_0 P(0) $$\n\nNow, we apply the inequality for initial bacterial clearance:\n$$ rN_0 - \\phi N_0 P(0) < 0 $$\n\nWe need to solve this inequality for $P(0)$.\n$$ rN_0 < \\phi N_0 P(0) $$\n\nSince the problem states $N_0 > 0$, and the adsorption rate constant $\\phi$ must be positive for any interaction to occur, we can divide both sides of the inequality by the positive quantity $\\phi N_0$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$ \\frac{rN_0}{\\phi N_0} < P(0) $$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ P(0) > \\frac{r}{\\phi} $$\n\nThis inequality specifies the condition on the initial phage density $P(0)$ for the bacterial population to begin to decline. The threshold $P_c$ is the minimal value that serves as the boundary for this condition. The set of values for $P(0)$ satisfying the condition is the interval $(\\frac{r}{\\phi}, \\infty)$. The infimum, or greatest lower bound, of this set is $\\frac{r}{\\phi}$. Therefore, the bacterial clearance threshold $P_c$ is given by this value.\n\n$$ P_c = \\frac{r}{\\phi} $$\n\nThe units of this expression are consistent. The per-capita bacterial growth rate $r$ has units of $\\text{time}^{-1}$, and the adsorption rate constant $\\phi$ has units of $\\text{volume}\\cdot\\text{time}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{number}^{-1}$. Thus, the units of $P_c$ are:\n$$ \\frac{[\\text{time}^{-1}]}{[\\text{volume}\\cdot\\text{time}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{number}^{-1}]} = \\frac{\\text{number}}{\\text{volume}} $$\nThis corresponds to a number density, as required for $P_c$. The derived expression is in terms of the parameters $r$ and $\\phi$, as requested.

The goal is to maximize the fraction of the pathogen population that is susceptible to at least one of the phages in the cocktail. Each phage in the cocktail binds a distinct cell-surface receptor: capsule K-antigen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core, outer membrane porin OmpK35, Type 1 fimbriae, and an O-acetylated exopolysaccharide. Single-cell phenotyping and multi-omics profiling in the intended clinical milieu indicate that the receptor phenotypes are orthogonal in their regulation and expression, and thus can be modeled as independent at the single-cell level. The measured prevalence of each receptor phenotype in the bacterial population is $p_1 = 0.62$, $p_2 = 0.41$, $p_3 = 0.27$, $p_4 = 0.33$, and $p_5 = 0.15$. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) is maintained sufficiently high so that a bacterium expressing any one of the targeted receptors is effectively killed by at least one cognate phage, and there is no cross-interference among phages.\n\nStarting from the foundational rules of probability (definitions of event independence, union, and complement), derive an expression for the expected coverage of the pathogen population by the cocktail, defined as the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium expresses at least one of the targeted receptors. Then compute its numerical value using the given receptor prevalences.

The problem provides the prevalences of these receptor phenotypes, which correspond to the probabilities of these events: $P(E_1) = p_1 = 0.62$, $P(E_2) = p_2 = 0.41$, $P(E_3) = p_3 = 0.27$, $P(E_4) = p_4 = 0.33$, and $P(E_5) = p_5 = 0.15$.\n\nThe \"expected coverage\" is the probability that a bacterium expresses at least one of the receptors. This is the probability of the union of the events, $P(E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3 \\cup E_4 \\cup E_5)$. A direct calculation using the principle of inclusion-exclusion is cumbersome. A more efficient approach is to use the complement rule.\n\nLet $R$ be the complement event, where a bacterium expresses *none* of the five receptors (i.e., it is resistant to the entire cocktail). The probability of coverage is then $1 - P(R)$. The event $R$ is the intersection of the complement events $E'_i$: $R = E'_1 \\cap E'_2 \\cap E'_3 \\cap E'_4 \\cap E'_5$.\n\nAs the events $E_i$ are independent, their complements $E'_i$ are also independent. Therefore, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(R) = \\prod_{i=1}^{5} P(E'_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^{5} (1 - p_i)$$\nThe general expression for coverage is therefore:\n$$\\text{Coverage} = 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^{5} (1 - p_i)$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

This will be accomplished by following the principles of conservation of mass and the definition of multiplicity of infection (MOI) within a single-compartment model.\n\nFirst, we must determine the target phage concentration, $C^{*}$, required in the central compartment immediately after infusion and clearance.

The problem states that a fraction $f$ of the total infused dose $D$ is cleared immediately. Therefore, the fraction of the dose that remains to establish the therapeutic concentration is $(1-f)$. The number of effective phage particles, $N_{\\text{eff}}$, is this remaining fraction of the total dose $D$:\n$$\nN_{\\text{eff}} = D \\cdot (1 - f)\n$$\n\nNow, we can derive the symbolic expression for $D$ by equating the two expressions for $N_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\nD \\cdot (1 - f) = \\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot B \\cdot V\n$$\nSolving for the total infused dose $D$, we obtain the final analytical expression:\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot B \\cdot V}{1 - f}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $D$ using the provided data:\n- $\\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 12$ (dimensionless)\n- $B = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}~\\text{CFU/mL}$\n- $V = 3.0~\\mathrm{L}$\n- $f = 0.55$ (dimensionless)\n\nIt is critical to ensure consistency of units.
