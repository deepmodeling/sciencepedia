Exon $7$ is the terminal exon. The canonical isoform includes exon $5$ (length $90$ nucleotides) and preserves the reading frame. A disease-associated splicing defect activates a cryptic $3^{\\prime}$ splice acceptor within intron $4$, creating inclusion of a pseudoexon of length $70$ nucleotides between exon $4$ and exon $5$. Inclusion of this pseudoexon causes a frameshift that places a premature termination codon (PTC) within exon $6$, located $120$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $6$–exon $7$ junction.

The ASO chemistry does not recruit Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) and does not overlap the canonical exon $5$ acceptor or its polypyrimidine tract. At a pharmacologically active concentration, nuclear occupancy of the target site is near-complete.\n\nUsing as fundamental bases the Central Dogma of molecular biology (DNA to RNA to protein), the definition of pre-messenger RNA splicing (removal of introns and ligation of exons by the spliceosome), the deposition of Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs) ~20–24 nucleotides upstream of exon–exon junctions, and the well-established rule that Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) is typically triggered when a PTC lies more than $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction, select the most accurate prediction for how the ASO will change isoform ratios and which isoforms will be subject to NMD at steady state.\n\nA.

Exon $7$ is the terminal exon.\n- **Canonical isoform**: Includes exon $5$. Exon $5$ length is $90$ nucleotides. Splicing is in-frame.\n- **Aberrant isoform (pseudoexon-included)**: A cryptic $3^{\\prime}$ splice acceptor in intron $4$ leads to inclusion of a $70$ nucleotide pseudoexon between exon $4$ and exon $5$. This causes a frameshift and a premature termination codon (PTC) in exon $6$, located $120$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $6$–exon $7$ junction.\n- **Skipped isoform**: Exon $5$ is skipped (exon $4$ spliced to exon $6$). Since exon $5$ is $90$ nt, this is an in-frame skipping event.\n- **Baseline isoform fractions**: Pseudoexon-included: $60\\%$; Canonical: $30\\%$; Exon $5$-skipped: $10\\%$.\n- **ASO characteristics**:\n    - Type: Steric-blocking.\n    - Target: Cryptic $3^{\\prime}$ acceptor and polypyrimidine tract in intron $4$.\n    - Chemistry: Does not recruit Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1).\n    - Specificity: Does not overlap the canonical exon $5$ acceptor or its polypyrimidine tract.\n    - Efficacy: Near-complete nuclear occupancy of the target site.\n- **Fundamental principles for analysis**:\n    - Central Dogma (DNA $\\to$ RNA $\\to$ protein).\n    - Pre-mRNA splicing.\n    - Exon Junction Complex (EJC) deposition: $\\sim 20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions.\n    - NMD rule: Triggered if a PTC is $> 50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The scenario is a classic and realistic application of ASO technology for treating splicing-associated genetic diseases. All concepts—alternative splicing, cryptic splice sites, frameshift mutations, PTCs, steric-blocking ASOs, and NMD (including the \"50-55 nt rule\")—are fundamental and accurately described principles of molecular biology. The numerical values (exon lengths, PTC position) are internally consistent and plausible. For example, an exon of length $90$ nt ($30 \\times 3$) is in-frame, while a pseudoexon of length $70$ nt ($23 \\times 3 + 1$) is not.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides sufficient information to derive a logical conclusion. The initial state is quantified, the intervention (ASO) is precisely defined in its mechanism and target, and the rules for analysis (NMD) are explicitly stated. A unique, meaningful prediction can be made.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is technical and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\n**1. Analysis of ASO Effect on Splicing Ratios**\nThe ASO is a steric-blocking oligonucleotide. Its function is to bind to a specific RNA sequence and physically prevent the binding of other factors, in this case, the spliceosome machinery.\n- **Target**: The ASO targets the cryptic $3^{\\prime}$ splice acceptor in intron $4$.\n- **Efficacy**: \"near-complete\" occupancy implies that the ASO will be highly effective at blocking this cryptic site.\n- **Consequence**: The production of the isoform that depends on this cryptic site—the pseudoexon-included isoform—will be strongly inhibited.\n\nAt baseline, $60\\%$ of transcripts are spliced to include the pseudoexon. With the ASO blocking this pathway, this $60\\%$ of pre-mRNA flux must be redirected to the other available splicing pathways: canonical inclusion of exon $5$ or skipping of exon $5$.\n\nThe problem states the ASO *does not* overlap the canonical sites for exon $5$. This implies that the ASO's primary mechanism is specific to the cryptic site and it does not directly promote or inhibit the other splicing events. The baseline fractions of canonical ($30\\%$) versus skipped ($10\\%$) transcripts suggest an inherent $3:1$ preference for exon $5$ inclusion over skipping by the spliceosome. It is logical to assume that this intrinsic preference will be maintained for the $60\\%$ of transcripts re-routed by the ASO.\n\nWe can estimate the new steady-state isoform fractions:\n- **Pseudoexon-included**: The ASO is highly effective, so this fraction should drop to a very low level, for instance, below $5\\%$.\n- **Canonical (Exon $5$-included)**: The original $30\\%$ plus a major share of the redirected $60\\%$. Estimated share: $\\frac{30}{30+10} \\times 60\\% = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60\\% = 45\\%$. New total: $30\\% + 45\\% = 75\\%$.\n- **Exon $5$-skipped**: The original $10\\%$ plus a minor share of the redirected $60\\%$. Estimated share: $\\frac{10}{30+10} \\times 60\\% = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60\\% = 15\\%$. New total: $10\\% + 15\\% = 25\\%$.\n\nTherefore, the predicted outcome is a strong reduction in pseudoexon inclusion, a substantial increase in the canonical isoform (to the $\\approx 75\\%$ range), and a modest increase in the exon $5$-skipped isoform (to the $\\approx 25\\%$ range).\n\n**2. Analysis of NMD Susceptibility**\nThe NMD rule states that a transcript is targeted for degradation if it contains a PTC located more than $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction. The final exon is exon $7$. Thus, in all isoforms containing exon $6$, the final junction is the exon $6$–exon $7$ junction.\n\n- **Pseudoexon-included isoform**:\n    - Contains a PTC in exon $6$.\n    - Position of PTC: $120$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $6$–exon $7$ junction.\n    - NMD check: $120 \\text{ nt} > 50\\text{–}55 \\text{ nt}$.\n    - Conclusion: This isoform is a substrate for NMD.\n\n- **Canonical isoform**:\n    - The problem states it preserves the reading frame. It does not contain a PTC.\n    - Conclusion: This isoform is stable and escapes NMD.\n\n- **Exon $5$-skipped isoform**:\n    - The problem states that skipping exon $5$ (length $90$ nt, a multiple of $3$) is an in-frame event.\n    - Therefore, the reading frame is maintained, and the transcript does not contain a PTC. It will be translated to produce a protein variant lacking the amino acids coded by exon $5$.\n    - Conclusion: This isoform is stable and escapes NMD.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n1.  **Isoform Ratios after ASO**: Pseudoexon isoform $\\to <5\\%$. Canonical isoform $\\to \\approx 70-85\\%$. Exon $5$-skipped isoform $\\to \\approx 10-25\\%$.\n2.  **NMD Status**: The pseudoexon-included isoform is subject to NMD. The canonical and exon $5$-skipped isoforms are not.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. After ASO, pseudoexon inclusion is strongly reduced (to below $5\\%$), the canonical exon $5$-included isoform increases substantially (to between $70\\%$ and $85\\%$), and the exon $5$-skipped isoform modestly increases (to between $10\\%$ and $25\\%$). The pseudoexon-included isoform remains subject to NMD because its PTC lies $120$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $6$–exon $7$ junction (greater than $50$–$55$ nucleotides), whereas both the canonical and exon $5$-skipped isoforms escape NMD.**\n- This option's prediction of isoform ratio changes aligns perfectly with the logical redistribution of splicing flux. The numerical ranges are consistent with our estimates.\n- Its analysis of NMD susceptibility is correct for all three isoforms, based on the provided rules. The PTC-containing isoform is correctly identified as an NMD target, and the two in-frame isoforms are correctly identified as escaping NMD.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. After ASO, pseudoexon inclusion is largely unchanged because steric-blocking ASOs do not affect splice-site recognition, but RNase H1-mediated degradation reduces all isoforms, increasing the apparent fraction of NMD-targeted transcripts.**\n- This option contains two fundamental errors based on the problem statement. First, the primary function of a steric-blocking ASO is precisely to affect splice-site recognition by blocking it. Second, the problem explicitly states the ASO does *not* recruit RNase H1.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. After ASO, cryptic pseudoexon inclusion is eliminated; however, because the target region is in intron $4$, spliceosome assembly at the canonical exon $5$ acceptor is broadly impaired, making exon $5$ skipping the dominant outcome (exceeding $70\\%$). The exon $5$-skipped isoform is out-of-frame and is therefore targeted by NMD, while the canonical isoform escapes NMD.**\n- This option makes an unsubstantiated claim of off-target steric hindrance, contradicting the problem's statement of ASO specificity (\"does not overlap the canonical exon $5$ acceptor\"). It also incorrectly claims the exon $5$-skipped isoform is out-of-frame, which is false since the skipped exon is $90$ nt (a multiple of $3$).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. After ASO, pseudoexon inclusion decreases, the canonical isoform decreases due to steric hindrance near exon $5$, and the exon $5$-skipped isoform increases moderately. Any isoform containing a PTC, regardless of its position relative to the last exon–exon junction, is equally subject to NMD, so both pseudoexon-included and exon $5$-skipped isoforms are degraded by NMD, but the canonical isoform is not.**\n- This option presents an incorrect model for NMD, stating it is position-independent. This directly contradicts the explicit rule given in the problem statement ($> 50$–$55$ nt rule). It also incorrectly suggests steric hindrance at the canonical site and incorrectly implies the skipped isoform has a PTC.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the principles and information provided, option A is the only one that accurately predicts both the splicing outcome and the NMD fate of the transcripts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5030905"}, {"introduction": "A central challenge in translational medicine is bridging the gap between molecular mechanism and clinical application.

We have $K_{p,uu} = 5.0$ and $f_{u,p} = 0.10$.\nWe can now solve for $C_{\\mathrm{plasma,avg,ss}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma,avg,ss}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tissue},u,\\mathrm{req}}}{K_{p,uu} \\times f_{u,p}} = \\frac{35 \\text{ nM}}{5.0 \\times 0.10} = \\frac{35 \\text{ nM}}{0.50} = 70 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the required weekly dose in moles.\nFor a one-compartment linear PK model at steady state, the average concentration is related to the dosing rate and clearance ($CL$):\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma,avg,ss}} = \\frac{\\text{Dosing Rate}}{CL}$$\nThe effective dosing rate is the administered subcutaneous dose ($D$) multiplied by the bioavailability ($F$) and divided by the dosing interval ($\\tau$).\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma,avg,ss}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{CL \\times \\tau}$$\nWe solve for the dose, $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{plasma,avg,ss}} \\times CL \\times \\tau}{F}$$\nBefore substituting values, we must ensure consistent units.\n$C_{\\mathrm{plasma,avg,ss}} = 70 \\text{ nM} = 70 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$\n$CL = 0.50 \\text{ L h}^{-1}$\n$\\tau = 168 \\text{ h}$\n$F = 0.80$ (unitless)\n$$D = \\frac{(70 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}) \\times (0.50 \\text{ L h}^{-1}) \\times (168 \\text{ h})}{0.80}$$\n$$D = \\frac{5880 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol}}{0.80} = 7350 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol} = 7.35 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol}$$\n\nStep 6: Convert the molar dose to mass in milligrams.\nThe mass dose ($D_{\\text{mass}}$) is the molar dose ($D$) multiplied by the molecular weight ($MW$).\n$MW = 8000 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$.\n$$D_{\\text{mass}} = (7.35 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol}) \\times (8000 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}) = 58.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ g} = 0.0588 \\text{ g}$$\nTo convert to milligrams, we multiply by $1000$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{mg}} = 0.0588 \\text{ g} \\times 1000 \\text{ mg g}^{-1} = 58.8 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe result is requested to three significant figures, which is $58.8 \\text{ mg}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{58.8}$$", "id": "5030876"}]}
