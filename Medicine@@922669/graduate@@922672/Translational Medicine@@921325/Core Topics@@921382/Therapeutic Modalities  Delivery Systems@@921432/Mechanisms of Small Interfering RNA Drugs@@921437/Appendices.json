In the context of translational medicine, designing an siRNA to reliably silence a target gene requires that the antisense strand (the guide) is preferentially loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whose core catalytic component is an AGO protein. The loading process involves the separation of the siRNA duplex's two strands. AGO is thought to initiate this unwinding at one of the duplex ends. An end with lower thermodynamic stability (i.e., a less negative or more positive free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$) requires less energy to \"fray\" or melt. Consequently, AGO preferentially engages with the less stable end of the duplex. The strand whose $5'$ end resides at this less stable terminus is then preferentially loaded as the guide strand, while the other strand (the passenger strand) is cleaved and ejected from the complex. Therefore, by designing the siRNA molecule such that the intended guide strand has a relatively unstable $5'$ end, one can bias the loading process to ensure the correct strand is active, thereby maximizing on-target efficacy and minimizing off-target effects.\n\nThe second task is to compute the guide-strand selection probability, $P_{\\text{guide}}$. This is modeled based on the thermodynamic stability of the two ends of the duplex. The end-instability metrics are defined as the sum of the first two stacking terms at each end.\nFor the candidate guide strand's $5'$ end:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{end,guide}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{1} + \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{2} = -1.1\\ \\text{kcal mol}^{-1} + (-1.0\\ \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}) = -2.1\\ \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\nFor the opposite end (candidate passenger strand's $5'$ end):\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{end,pass}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{17} + \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{18} = -2.6\\ \\text{kcal mol}^{-1} + (-2.4\\ \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}) = -5.0\\ \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\nAs expected, $\\Delta G_{\\text{end,guide}} > \\Delta G_{\\text{end,pass}}$, indicating the guide end is thermodynamically less stable.
