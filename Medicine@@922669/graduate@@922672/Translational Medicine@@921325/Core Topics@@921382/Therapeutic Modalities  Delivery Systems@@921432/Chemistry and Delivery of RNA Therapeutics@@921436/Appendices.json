A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the fraction of the lipid that is protonated, $\\alpha$, as a function of $pH$ and $pK_{a}$. The definition of $\\alpha$ is given as:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] + [\\mathrm{B}]}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we must relate the concentrations $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$ and $[\\mathrm{B}]$. The acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is defined as:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the concentration of the neutral base, $[\\mathrm{B}]$, in terms of the concentration of the conjugate acid, $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$, and the proton concentration, $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{B}] = K_{a} \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{B}]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] + K_{a} \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}}\n$$\nThe term $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$ appears in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator, so it can be factored out and cancelled:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] \\cdot 1}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{K_a}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_a}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}}\n$$\nThis expression relates $\\alpha$ to $K_a$ and $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$. We are asked to express it as a function of $pK_a$ and $pH$. Using the provided definitions $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10} K_{a}$ and $pH = -\\log_{10} [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, we can write:\n$$\nK_a = 10^{-pK_a}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = 10^{-pH}\n$$\nSubstituting these exponential forms into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-pK_a}}{10^{-pH}}}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}$, the ratio becomes:\n$$\n\\alpha(pH, pK_a) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-pK_a - (-pH)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the protonated fraction $\\alpha$ as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$. This is a form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\alpha$ for the given conditions. The lipid has a $pK_{a} = 6.5$.\n\nIn blood plasma, the $pH$ is $7.4$. The fraction of protonated lipid, $\\alpha(7.4)$, is:\n$$\n\\alpha(pH = 7.4) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.4 - 6.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.9}}\n$$\n\nIn the early endosome, the $pH$ is $5.5$. The fraction of protonated lipid, $\\alpha(5.5)$, is:\n$$\n\\alpha(pH = 5.5) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{5.5 - 6.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-1.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{1}{1.1}\n$$\n\nThe fold-increase in protonation, $R$, is the ratio of the protonated fraction in the endosome to that in the plasma:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\alpha(pH = 5.5)}{\\alpha(pH = 7.4)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-1.0}}}{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.9}}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{0.9}}{1 + 10^{-1.0}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{0.9}}{1.1}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n10^{0.9} \\approx 7.9432823\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx \\frac{1 + 7.9432823}{1.1} = \\frac{8.9432823}{1.1} \\approx 8.1302566\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $R = 8.130$.\n\nFinally, the brief explanation of the impact of this protonation shift is as follows. The sharp, pH-triggered increase in protonation is a critical design feature for effective RNA delivery by LNPs.\nIn the bloodstream at a physiological $pH$ of $7.4$, which is above the lipid's $pK_a$ of $6.5$, the ionizable lipid is predominantly in its neutral form, $\\mathrm{B}$. This near-neutral surface charge minimizes non-specific electrostatic interactions with negatively charged blood components (like serum proteins and cell surfaces), thereby increasing circulation time and reducing premature clearance of the LNP.\nUpon cellular uptake via endocytosis, the LNP is trafficked into an endosome, where the internal environment is acidic, with a $pH$ dropping to approximately $5.5$. As this $pH$ is below the lipid's $pK_a$, the basic amine group of the lipid becomes heavily protonated, transitioning to its cationic form, $\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$. Our calculation of an approximately $8$-fold increase in protonation quantifies this switch.\nThe resulting highly positive surface charge of the LNP facilitates strong electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged inner leaflet of the endosomal membrane (which is rich in anionic lipids). This interaction is thought to destabilize the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion and/or pore formation. This process allows the LNP to disrupt the endosomal vesicle and release its RNA cargo into the cell's cytoplasm, an event known as \"endosomal escape.\" Without this pH-dependent protonation and subsequent membrane disruption, the RNA payload would remain trapped in the endosome and eventually be degraded, rendering the therapeutic ineffective.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.130}\n$$", "id": "4997399"}, {"introduction": "Moving from molecular design to a finished product requires rigorous quality control.

It is a valid problem in the field of pharmaceutical sciences and biophysical chemistry. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe fundamental principle of the RiboGreen assay, when operated in its linear range, is that the measured fluorescence is directly proportional to the mass of accessible ribonucleic acid (RNA). Let $m_{\\text{accessible}}$ be the mass of RNA accessible to the dye. The background-corrected fluorescence, $F'$, is given by:\n$$F' = k \\cdot m_{\\text{accessible}}$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the assay conditions (e.g., dye concentration, instrument settings).\n\nFirst, we must define the relevant quantities. Let $m_{\\text{total}}$ be the total mass of mRNA in the sample, $m_{\\text{free}}$ be the mass of free (non-encapsulated) mRNA, and $m_{\\text{encap}}$ be the mass of encapsulated mRNA. By definition, these quantities are related by the mass balance equation:\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = m_{\\text{free}} + m_{\\text{encap}}$$\nThe encapsulation efficiency, denoted as $EE$, is defined as the fraction of the total RNA that is encapsulated:\n$$EE = \\frac{m_{\\text{encap}}}{m_{\\text{total}}}$$\nUsing the mass balance equation, we can rewrite $EE$ in terms of the free and total RNA masses:\n$$EE = \\frac{m_{\\text{total}} - m_{\\text{free}}}{m_{\\text{total}}} = 1 - \\frac{m_{\\text{free}}}{m_{\\text{total}}}$$\nOur goal is to determine the ratio $\\frac{m_{\\text{free}}}{m_{\\text{total}}}$ from the provided fluorescence measurements.\n\nAll raw fluorescence measurements must first be corrected by subtracting the background fluorescence from the blank dye solution, $F_{\\text{blank}}$. Let the background-corrected fluorescence for the sample without detergent be $F'_{-}$ and for the sample with detergent be $F'_{+}$.\n$$F'_{-} = F_{-} - F_{\\text{blank}}$$\n$$F'_{+} = F_{+} - F_{\\text{blank}}$$\n\nNext, we model the accessible RNA mass for each condition.\n\n1.  **Sample with detergent ($F_{+}$):** The detergent solubilizes the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), making all RNA in the sample accessible to the RiboGreen dye. Thus, $m_{\\text{accessible}} = m_{\\text{total}}$. The measurement is taken in a solution where the LNP structure is destroyed, so we assume no matrix-specific optical quenching. The corresponding background-corrected fluorescence is:\n    $$F'_{+} = k \\cdot m_{\\text{total}}$$\n\n2.  **Sample without detergent ($F_{-}$):** In the absence of detergent, only the free, non-encapsulated RNA is accessible to the dye. Thus, $m_{\\text{accessible}} = m_{\\text{free}}$. However, this measurement is made in the presence of intact LNPs, which cause optical effects (quenching and scattering). The problem states that these effects reduce the fluorescence response to a fraction $q$ of its ideal value. The ideal fluorescence from the free RNA would be $k \\cdot m_{\\text{free}}$. Therefore, the measured background-corrected fluorescence is:\n    $$F'_{-} = q \\cdot (k \\cdot m_{\\text{free}})$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations relating the measured fluorescence to the RNA masses:\n$$F'_{+} = k \\cdot m_{\\text{total}} \\quad (1)$$\n$$F'_{-} = q \\cdot k \\cdot m_{\\text{free}} \\quad (2)$$\nFrom these equations, we can express the masses in terms of the fluorescence values:\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{F'_{+}}{k}$$\n$$m_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{F'_{-}}{q \\cdot k}$$\nWe can now compute the ratio $\\frac{m_{\\text{free}}}{m_{\\text{total}}}$ needed to find the encapsulation efficiency:\n$$\\frac{m_{\\text{free}}}{m_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{F'_{-} / (q \\cdot k)}{F'_{+} / k} = \\frac{F'_{-}}{q \\cdot F'_{+}}$$\nSubstituting this ratio into our expression for $EE$:\n$$EE = 1 - \\frac{F'_{-}}{q \\cdot F'_{+}}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the background-corrected fluorescence values to obtain the closed-form expression in terms of the raw measurements:\n$$EE = 1 - \\frac{F_{-} - F_{\\text{blank}}}{q \\cdot (F_{+} - F_{\\text{blank}})}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nPhysically, the encapsulation efficiency $EE$ is a mass fraction, so its value must be constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$. A value of $EE=1$ implies perfect encapsulation ($m_{\\text{free}}=0$), while a value of $EE=0$ implies no encapsulation ($m_{\\text{encap}}=0$). For a therapeutic LNP-mRNA formulation to be viable for translational medicine, a very high encapsulation efficiency is required, typically greater than $90\\%$ and often targeting over $95\\%$. This is because free mRNA is rapidly degraded by nucleases in vivo and does not contribute to the therapeutic effect, while potentially causing immunogenic side effects.\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value for the given data:\n- $F_{\\text{blank}} = 1.8 \\times 10^{4}$ $\\mathrm{RFU}$\n- $F_{-} = 3.2 \\times 10^{5}$ $\\mathrm{RFU}$\n- $F_{+} = 8.9 \\times 10^{5}$ $\\mathrm{RFU}$\n- $q = 0.90$\n\nFirst, calculate the background-corrected fluorescence values:\n$$F'_{-} = F_{-} - F_{\\text{blank}} = (3.2 \\times 10^{5}) - (1.8 \\times 10^{4}) = 320000 - 18000 = 302000 = 3.02 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ RFU}$$\n$$F'_{+} = F_{+} - F_{\\text{blank}} = (8.9 \\times 10^{5}) - (1.8 \\times 10^{4}) = 890000 - 18000 = 872000 = 8.72 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ RFU}$$\nNow, substitute these values into the derived expression for $EE$:\n$$EE = 1 - \\frac{3.02 \\times 10^{5}}{0.90 \\cdot (8.72 \\times 10^{5})}$$\n$$EE = 1 - \\frac{3.02}{0.90 \\times 8.72}$$\n$$EE = 1 - \\frac{3.02}{7.848}$$\n$$EE = 1 - 0.384811417...$$\n$$EE \\approx 0.615188583...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$EE \\approx 0.6152$$\nThis value indicates that approximately $61.52\\%$ of the mRNA is encapsulated, which, as noted, would be considered suboptimal for a clinical-stage formulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6152}$$", "id": "4997427"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the value of a therapeutic is measured by its effect in a living system.

The derived dose-effect relation can now be written in its final, standard form:\n$$E(D) = \\frac{E_{\\max} D}{ED_{50} + D}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Knockdown at a Specific Dose**\n\nWe are asked to compute the expected knockdown $E$ for a dose $D = 0.25 \\, \\mathrm{mg/kg}$, using the provided calibrated parameters $E_{\\max} = 0.90$ and $ED_{50} = 0.10 \\, \\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\nUsing the standard dose-response equation derived above:\n$$E(D) = \\frac{E_{\\max} D}{ED_{50} + D}$$\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$E(0.25) = \\frac{0.90 \\times 0.25}{0.10 + 0.25}$$\n$$E(0.25) = \\frac{0.225}{0.35}$$\nTo perform the calculation without a calculator, we can express the numbers as fractions:\n$$E(0.25) = \\frac{225/1000}{35/100} = \\frac{225}{1000} \\times \\frac{100}{35} = \\frac{225}{350}$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by common factors:\n$$E(0.25) = \\frac{225 \\div 25}{350 \\div 25} = \\frac{9}{14}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$E = \\frac{9}{14} \\approx 0.64285714...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$E \\approx 0.6429$$\nThe expected fractional knockdown at a dose of $0.25 \\, \\mathrm{mg/kg}$ is $0.6429$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6429}\n$$", "id": "4997418"}]}
