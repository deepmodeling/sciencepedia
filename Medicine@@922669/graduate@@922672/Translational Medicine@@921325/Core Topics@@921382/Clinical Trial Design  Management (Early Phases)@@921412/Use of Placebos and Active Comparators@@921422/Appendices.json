The trial is planned with one-sided hypothesis tests, consistent with conventional practice for superiority and noninferiority. The acceptable clinical noninferiority margin on the absolute scale is prespecified as $\\Delta_{RD} > 0$, and the corresponding margin on the relative scale is $M_{RR} > 1$. Assume the event is undesirable, so smaller $p_T$ is favorable. In noninferiority design based on an active comparator, margin anchoring draws upon historical placebo-controlled evidence and requires assay sensitivity (AS) and the constancy assumption (CA), and margin translation across scales must be justified using the expected control event rate under contemporary standard-of-care.

Extraction of Givens:**\n- A randomized clinical trial compares a new therapy (T) to an active comparator (C).\n- The endpoint is a clinically undesirable binary event.\n- $p_T$ is the event probability in the treatment arm.\n- $p_C$ is the event probability in the control arm.\n- Risk Difference ($RD$) is defined as $RD = p_T - p_C$.\n- Risk Ratio ($RR$) is defined as $RR = \\frac{p_T}{p_C}$.\n- Hypothesis tests are one-sided.\n- For an undesirable event, a smaller $p_T$ is favorable.\n- The noninferiority margin on the absolute scale is $\\Delta_{RD} > 0$.\n- The noninferiority margin on the relative scale is $M_{RR} > 1$.\n- Noninferiority design context: margin anchoring, assay sensitivity (AS), constancy assumption (CA), and margin translation are mentioned as requirements.\n- Target reference control risk for margin translation: $p_C^{\\ast} = 0.20$.\n- Prespecified absolute margin: $\\Delta_{RD} = 0.03$.\n\n**2. Validation of Givens:**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of biostatistics and clinical trial design. The definitions of risk difference, risk ratio, superiority, noninferiority, and the framework for hypothesis testing are standard. The concepts of assay sensitivity, constancy assumption, and margin anchoring are central to the methodology of active-control noninferiority trials, as detailed in regulatory guidelines (e.g., from the FDA and EMA).\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides clear, unambiguous definitions and numerical values, and asks for an evaluation of statements based on these premises. A unique evaluation is possible for each statement.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is formal, precise, and objective, using standard terminology from the field of clinical trials.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The provided information is internally consistent and sufficient to evaluate all the statements. For example, the data required for margin translation ($p_C^{\\ast}$ and $\\Delta_{RD}$) are provided.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question on the topic of hypothesis testing and margin specification in clinical trials. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Principles:**\n\nFor an undesirable event, a better outcome corresponds to a lower event probability. Thus, the new therapy is superior to the control if $p_T  p_C$. It is noninferior if it is not unacceptably worse, meaning the increase in risk is limited by a prespecified margin.\n\n**1. Superiority Hypotheses:**\nThe objective is to establish that the new therapy is superior, i.e., $p_T  p_C$. This is the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$). The null hypothesis ($H_0$) represents the absence of superiority.\n- **Risk Difference ($RD$) scale:** $H_1: p_T  p_C \\Leftrightarrow p_T - p_C  0 \\Leftrightarrow RD  0$. The corresponding null hypothesis is $H_0: RD \\ge 0$.\n- **Risk Ratio ($RR$) scale:** $H_1: p_T  p_C \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{p_T}{p_C}  1 \\Leftrightarrow RR  1$ (assuming $p_C > 0$). The corresponding null hypothesis is $H_0: RR \\ge 1$.\n\n**2. Noninferiority Hypotheses:**\nThe objective is to establish that the new therapy is not unacceptably worse than the control. \"Unacceptably worse\" is defined by the margin.\n- **Risk Difference ($RD$) scale:** We want to show that the excess risk $p_T - p_C$ is less than the margin $\\Delta_{RD}$. Thus, $H_1: p_T - p_C  \\Delta_{RD} \\Leftrightarrow RD  \\Delta_{RD}$. The null hypothesis, representing inferiority, is $H_0: RD \\ge \\Delta_{RD}$.\n- **Risk Ratio ($RR$) scale:** We want to show that the relative increase in risk $\\frac{p_T}{p_C}$ is less than the margin $M_{RR}$. Thus, $H_1: \\frac{p_T}{p_C}  M_{RR} \\Leftrightarrow RR  M_{RR}$. The null hypothesis, representing inferiority, is $H_0: RR \\ge M_{RR}$.\n\n**3. Margin Translation:**\nA noninferiority margin on the absolute scale, $\\Delta_{RD}$, implies an upper limit on the treatment event rate of $p_T = p_C + \\Delta_{RD}$. To translate this to a relative margin, $M_{RR}$, this relationship is evaluated at the reference control risk, $p_C^{\\ast}$.\n$$M_{RR} = \\frac{p_{T, \\text{limit}}}{p_{C, \\text{ref}}} = \\frac{p_C^{\\ast} + \\Delta_{RD}}{p_C^{\\ast}} = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta_{RD}}{p_C^{\\ast}}$$\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. For superiority on the risk difference scale with an undesirable event, the one-sided null and alternative hypotheses are $H_0: RD \\ge 0$ versus $H_1: RD  0$.**\nAs derived above, to demonstrate superiority for an undesirable event, one must show that the risk in the treatment arm is lower than in the control arm, i.e., $p_T  p_C$. This is equivalent to $p_T - p_C  0$, or $RD  0$. This constitutes the alternative hypothesis, $H_1$. The null hypothesis is the complement, $H_0: RD \\ge 0$. The statement is consistent with this derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For superiority on the risk ratio scale with an undesirable event, the one-sided null and alternative hypotheses are $H_0: RR \\ge 1$ versus $H_1: RR  1$.**\nSimilarly, superiority ($p_T  p_C$) on the risk ratio scale is equivalent to $p_T / p_C  1$, or $RR  1$. This is the alternative hypothesis, $H_1$. The null hypothesis is the complement, $H_0: RR \\ge 1$. The statement is consistent with this derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For noninferiority on the risk difference scale with margin $\\Delta_{RD}$, the one-sided null and alternative hypotheses are $H_0: RD \\ge \\Delta_{RD}$ versus $H_1: RD  \\Delta_{RD}$.**\nTo demonstrate noninferiority, one must show that the treatment is not unacceptably worse than the control. On the risk difference scale, this means the true difference $p_T - p_C$ must be less than the margin $\\Delta_{RD}$. This is the alternative hypothesis: $H_1: RD  \\Delta_{RD}$. The null hypothesis, which states that the treatment is inferior, is therefore $H_0: RD \\ge \\Delta_{RD}$. The statement is consistent with this derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For noninferiority on the risk ratio scale with margin $M_{RR}$, the one-sided null and alternative hypotheses are $H_0: RR \\ge M_{RR}$ versus $H_1: RR  M_{RR}$.**\nOn the risk ratio scale, noninferiority means the true ratio $p_T / p_C$ must be less than the margin $M_{RR}$. This is the alternative hypothesis: $H_1: RR  M_{RR}$. The null hypothesis, which states that the treatment is inferior, is therefore $H_0: RR \\ge M_{RR}$. The statement is consistent with this derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. With $p_C^{\\ast} = 0.20$ and $\\Delta_{RD} = 0.03$, a consistent multiplicative margin is $M_{RR} = 1.15$.**\nUsing the margin translation formula derived above:\n$$M_{RR} = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta_{RD}}{p_C^{\\ast}} = 1 + \\frac{0.03}{0.20} = 1 + 0.15 = 1.15$$\nAlternatively, $M_{RR} = \\frac{p_C^{\\ast} + \\Delta_{RD}}{p_C^{\\ast}} = \\frac{0.20 + 0.03}{0.20} = \\frac{0.23}{0.20} = 1.15$.\nThe calculation is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. The multiplicative margin corresponding to a fixed $\\Delta_{RD}$ is invariant to the actual control risk $p_C$ observed in the trial, so a single $M_{RR}$ derived once provides identical protection across all baseline risks.**\nThe formula for the multiplicative margin corresponding to an absolute margin $\\Delta_{RD}$ at a given control risk $p_C$ is $M_{RR}(p_C) = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta_{RD}}{p_C}$. This formula explicitly shows that $M_{RR}$ is a function of $p_C$. For a fixed $\\Delta_{RD}$, if $p_C$ decreases, $M_{RR}$ increases, and if $p_C$ increases, $M_{RR}$ decreases. Therefore, the multiplicative margin is not invariant to the control risk. The statement is factually incorrect and misrepresents a critical issue in the design of noninferiority trials.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**G. When translating an absolute margin to a relative margin for an active-comparator noninferiority trial, a reference $p_C^{\\ast}$ reflecting contemporary standard-of-care must be specified, because absolute differences are not transportable across shifts in baseline risk, whereas ratio-based effects are approximately transportable under the constancy assumption; margin translation should therefore be anchored to $p_C^{\\ast}$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the standard rationale in noninferiority trial design. The \"constancy assumption\" often implies that the effect of a treatment, particularly when measured on a relative scale (like a risk ratio or odds ratio), remains relatively stable across populations with varying baseline risks. In contrast, an absolute effect measure, like the risk difference, will typically vary with baseline risk. Because of this, translating a clinically derived absolute margin ($\\Delta_{RD}$) to a relative margin ($M_{RR}$), or interpreting the clinical meaning of a result on one scale based on a margin defined on the other, requires anchoring the conversion to a specific, clinically relevant, and anticipated control group risk, $p_C^{\\ast}$. The statement's reasoning is sound and reflects established regulatory and statistical principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**H. Because the use of placebo is unethical when there is established effective therapy, noninferiority hypotheses must always be specified on the risk ratio scale and never on the risk difference scale.**\nThe premise that using a placebo is often unethical when an effective therapy exists is correct and is the primary justification for noninferiority trials. However, the conclusion is an unsubstantiated and false absolute. Regulatory agencies and statistical guidelines permit the specification of noninferiority margins on either the risk difference scale or the risk ratio scale. The choice of scale is a subject of considerable debate and depends on the specific clinical context, but there is no mandate to \"always\" use the risk ratio scale or a prohibition to \"never\" use the risk difference scale. Many trials are successfully designed and conducted using a risk difference margin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCDEG}$$", "id": "5074707"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most critical aspect of a non-inferiority trial is setting the margin, a value that defines the boundary of \"not unacceptably worse.\" This margin isn't arbitrary; it must be rigorously justified to ensure a new therapy preserves a meaningful portion of the active comparator's established effect over placebo. This practice guides you through the gold-standard method of deriving a margin from historical data, a crucial skill in translational medicine that bridges past evidence with future research. [@problem_id:5074743]", "problem": "A translational medicine team is planning a noninferiority trial comparing a new therapy to an established active comparator. To set margins grounded in historical evidence and clinical relevance, they rely on a meta-analytic synthesis of rigorously conducted, placebo-controlled trials of the active comparator. The meta-analysis yields an estimated mean true effect of the active comparator relative to placebo of $\\Delta_{H} = 2.0$ (in the same continuous outcome units as the primary endpoint of the planned trial), and a between-study standard deviation of true effects (heterogeneity) of $s_{H} = 0.5$. Assume that trial-level true effects for the active comparator against placebo are well approximated by a normal distribution centered at $\\Delta_{H}$ with dispersion $s_{H}$, and that the historical and planned trial contexts satisfy the constancy assumptions (including assay sensitivity, measurement invariance, and alignment of patient populations, endpoints, and care standards) needed to transport evidence.\n\nStarting from core definitions of noninferiority and using well-tested principles of meta-analysis and probability, derive a conservative historical margin $M_{1}$ representing the smallest plausible true effect of the active comparator versus placebo across the distribution of trial contexts that match the planned trial, and then construct a conservative noninferiority margin $M_{2}$ that preserves a fraction $p = 0.5$ of that effect. Provide a clear justification of the assumptions required for these constructions, including why the chosen bound for $M_{1}$ is appropriate for assay sensitivity and transportability, and how preserving a fraction of $M_{1}$ protects against dilution of efficacy.\n\nCompute and report numerical values for $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. Round both values to three significant figures. Express $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ in the same outcome units as $\\Delta_{H}$. Write your final numerical answers as two entries in a single row matrix.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of two noninferiority margins, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, based on a meta-analytic synthesis of historical data for an active comparator. This process is a cornerstone of modern clinical trial design, particularly for establishing noninferiority in a manner that ensures the new therapy retains a clinically meaningful effect. The derivation proceeds in two steps, as outlined in regulatory guidance such as ICH E10.\n\nFirst, we determine the historical margin, $M_{1}$. This margin represents a conservative estimate of the effect of the active comparator relative to placebo. The problem states that the true effects of the active comparator from placebo-controlled trials are well-approximated by a normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(\\Delta_{H}, s_{H}^2)$, where the mean effect is $\\Delta_{H} = 2.0$ and the between-study standard deviation (heterogeneity) is $s_{H} = 0.5$. This distribution models our knowledge about the comparator's effect across a range of trial contexts.\n\nThe task is to find the \"smallest plausible true effect\" of the comparator. In this statistical framework, this corresponds to a lower-bound of a prediction interval for the true effect in a future trial. A prediction interval is appropriate because it accounts for both the uncertainty in the estimation of the mean effect $\\Delta_{H}$ (which is assumed to be negligible here, as $\\Delta_H$ is given as a point estimate) and, critically, the random, trial-to-trial variability represented by $s_{H}$.\n\nTo ensure a conservative margin, which is paramount for patient safety and assuring efficacy, we select a high confidence level for this lower bound. A standard and appropriately conservative choice in regulatory science is a one-sided $97.5\\%$ confidence level. This corresponds to the lower limit of a two-sided $95\\%$ interval and ensures that there is only a $2.5\\%$ chance that the true effect of the comparator in the new trial is less than $M_{1}$. The critical value from the standard normal distribution for a cumulative probability of $1 - 0.025 = 0.975$ is $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.960$.\n\nThus, the historical margin $M_{1}$ is calculated as:\n$$M_{1} = \\Delta_{H} - z_{0.025} \\cdot s_{H}$$\nThis formulation is justified because it establishes a floor for the comparator's effect with high confidence. The satisfaction of the \"constancy assumption\" is critical here; it posits that the historical trial contexts are sufficiently similar to the planned trial's context, making the predictive distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\Delta_{H}, s_{H}^2)$ applicable. By using this lower bound $M_{1}$, we ensure assay sensitivity: if $M_{1}  0$, we are confident that the active comparator is effective in the planned trial's setting, which is a prerequisite for a noninferiority comparison.\n\nSecond, we construct the noninferiority margin, $M_{2}$. This margin is the largest acceptable loss of efficacy for the new therapy compared to the active comparator. The guiding principle is that the new therapy must preserve a pre-specified fraction, $p$, of the active comparator's effect, $M_{1}$. Let $\\Delta_{T}$ be the effect of the new therapy versus placebo and $\\Delta_{A}$ be the effect of the active comparator versus placebo. We require that the new therapy's effect is at least a fraction $p$ of the comparator's effect:\n$$\\Delta_{T} \\ge p \\cdot \\Delta_{A}$$\nThe noninferiority hypothesis is tested on the difference in effects, $\\delta = \\Delta_{A} - \\Delta_{T}$. Rearranging the preservation requirement, we get:\n$$\\Delta_{A} - \\delta \\ge p \\cdot \\Delta_{A}$$\n$$\\delta \\le \\Delta_{A} (1-p)$$\nTo be conservative, we must base this on the smallest plausible effect of the comparator, which is $M_{1}$. Therefore, the noninferiority margin $M_{2}$ is set as:\n$$M_{2} = M_{1} (1-p)$$\nThe problem specifies that a fraction $p=0.5$ of the effect must be preserved. This practice protects against \"bio-creep\" or the dilution of efficacy, where a new drug that is non-inferior to a weakly effective comparator might itself have little to no clinically relevant effect over placebo. By requiring the new therapy to preserve at least $50\\%$ of the comparator's minimal plausible effect, we ensure it is demonstrably efficacious.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values.\nGiven:\nMean historical effect, $\\Delta_{H} = 2.0$.\nHeterogeneity standard deviation, $s_{H} = 0.5$.\nFraction to preserve, $p = 0.5$.\nChosen critical value, $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.960$.\n\nCalculation of $M_{1}$:\n$$M_{1} = 2.0 - 1.960 \\times 0.5 = 2.0 - 0.98 = 1.02$$\n\nCalculation of $M_{2}$:\n$$M_{2} = M_{1} (1 - 0.5) = 1.02 \\times 0.5 = 0.51$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures.\n$M_{1} = 1.02$ is already stated with three significant figures.\n$M_{2} = 0.51$ needs to be expressed with three significant figures, which is $0.510$.\n\nSo, the conservative historical margin is $M_{1} = 1.02$, and the conservative noninferiority margin is $M_{2} = 0.510$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.02  0.510\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5074743"}, {"introduction": "A well-justified non-inferiority margin, $\\Delta_{NI}$, must satisfy two distinct criteria: it must meet statistical requirements for effect preservation and it must be small enough to be clinically irrelevant to patients.

This integrated assessment is essential for ensuring that a \"non-inferior\" finding truly means the new therapy is a worthwhile alternative for patients.

You are asked to evaluate whether $\\Delta_{NI}=1.0$ unit is clinically and regulatorily acceptable by mapping observed changes to patient-important differences and effect preservation expectations.\n\nFundamental base and context:\n\n- In a non-inferiority design with a beneficial endpoint, the null hypothesis can be stated as $H_{0}: \\mu_{\\text{new}} - \\mu_{\\text{active}} \\le -\\Delta_{NI}$ versus $H_{A}: \\mu_{\\text{new}} - \\mu_{\\text{active}}  -\\Delta_{NI}$, where $\\mu_{\\text{new}}$ and $\\mu_{\\text{active}}$ are the mean changes from baseline under the new treatment and the active comparator, respectively.

Evaluation via Effect Preservation Principle**\n\nThis principle ensures that the new treatment preserves a substantial fraction of the active comparator's known effect over a placebo. The most conservative, credible estimate of the active comparator's effect is the lower bound of its confidence interval from historical trials.\n- The lower bound of the $95\\%$ confidence interval for the active comparator's effect over placebo is given as $L = 1.4$ units.\n- The regulatory guidance mandates preserving a fraction of at least $f=0.5$ of this effect.\n- The problem explicitly states the rule for calculating the maximum acceptable margin: \"the acceptable margin should not exceed $f$ times the lower confidence bound on the historical effect.\"\n\nLet $\\Delta_{NI, \\text{max-EP}}$ be the maximum acceptable margin based on effect preservation. According to the stated rule:\n$$ \\Delta_{NI, \\text{max-EP}} = f \\times L $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta_{NI, \\text{max-EP}} = 0.5 \\times 1.4 = 0.7 \\text{ units} $$\nThe proposed margin is $\\Delta_{NI} = 1.0$ unit. We compare the proposed margin to the maximum acceptable margin:\n$$ 1.0 > 0.7 $$\nThe proposed margin of $1.0$ unit exceeds the maximum margin of $0.7$ units permitted by the effect preservation criterion. Therefore, based on this principle, the proposed margin is unacceptable.\n\n**2. Evaluation via Patient-Important Difference (PID) Principle**\n\nThis principle dictates that the margin $\\Delta_{NI}$ should not be so large as to represent a clinically meaningful decrement in outcome for the patient. If the new treatment is declared non-inferior, the true difference between the new treatment and the active comparator could be as large as $\\Delta_{NI}$. This potential loss of efficacy must be clinically acceptable.\n- The primary anchor-based estimate for the minimal clinically important improvement is given as $\\theta_{PID} = 0.9$ units. A change of this magnitude is considered the smallest difference that is meaningful to a patient.\n- The margin $\\Delta_{NI}$ represents the largest tolerable loss of effect. For a margin to be considered acceptable, it should ideally be smaller than the minimal clinically important difference. If $\\Delta_{NI} \\ge \\theta_{PID}$, it means that a new drug could be declared non-inferior even if it is worse than the active comparator by an amount that is clinically meaningful to patients.\n\nWe compare the proposed margin to the PID:\n$$ \\Delta_{NI} = 1.0 \\text{ unit} $$\n$$ \\theta_{PID} = 0.9 \\text{ units} $$\nHere, we see that:\n$$ 1.0 > 0.9 $$\nThe proposed margin of $1.0$ unit is greater than the minimal clinically important difference of $0.9$ units. This means the trial is designed to potentially allow a loss of efficacy that patients would perceive as significant. Therefore, based on this principle, the proposed margin is also unacceptable.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**\nThe proposed non-inferiority margin $\\Delta_{NI}=1.0$ unit is unacceptable on two separate grounds: it fails the quantitative regulatory requirement for effect preservation and it represents a potential loss of effect that is larger than what is considered clinically important to patients.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\Delta_{NI}=1.0$ unit is acceptable because it is smaller than the historical mean effect of $2.0$ units and is close to the patient-important threshold of $\\theta_{PID}=0.9$ units, thus preserving clinical benefit.**\n- The justification for a non-inferiority margin relies on preserving a fraction of the *conservatively estimated* effect (the lower bound of the CI, $L=1.4$), not the point estimate of the mean effect ($\\hat{\\delta}_{AC-PB}=2.0$). This part of the reasoning is flawed.\n- A margin being \"close to\" the patient-important difference is not sufficient for acceptability. In fact, a margin that is equal to or greater than the PID ($\\Delta_{NI} \\ge \\theta_{PID}$) is generally unacceptable because it allows for a clinically meaningful loss of benefit. Here, $1.0 > 0.9$.\n- The overall conclusion that the margin is \"acceptable\" is incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $\\Delta_{NI}=1.0$ unit is not acceptable because it exceeds the effect-preservation requirement $f \\times 1.4$ units and would allow loss equal to or greater than the anchor-based patient-important difference $\\theta_{PID}$.**\n- The effect-preservation requirement sets a maximum margin of $f \\times L = 0.5 \\times 1.4 = 0.7$ units. The proposed margin of $1.0$ unit does indeed exceed this value. This statement is correct.\n- The anchor-based patient-important difference is $\\theta_{PID} = 0.9$ units. The proposed margin of $1.0$ unit is greater than this value, meaning the trial would allow a loss of efficacy that is clinically meaningful. This statement is also correct.\n- The conclusion that the margin is \"not acceptable\" is correctly derived from these two valid points. This option accurately reflects the dual failure of the proposed margin.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. $\\Delta_{NI}=1.0$ unit is acceptable provided the trial demonstrates assay sensitivity via high placebo response, since placebo responses can reach $\\ge 1.0$ unit and the margin is conservative relative to that.**\n- Assay sensitivity (the ability of a trial to detect a true effect) is a prerequisite for interpreting any non-inferiority trial but does not justify the magnitude of the margin.\n- The margin is not evaluated relative to the placebo response, but relative to the effect of the active comparator *over* placebo. A high placebo response can actually diminish the observed active-vs-placebo effect, making it more difficult to justify any non-inferiority margin. The reasoning is fundamentally flawed.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\Delta_{NI}=1.0$ unit is acceptable only if the primary analysis is restricted to the per-protocol population; otherwise, the intention-to-treat analysis biases toward non-inferiority and requires a larger margin.**\n- The choice of margin is independent of the analysis population (Intention-to-Treat vs. Per-Protocol). The margin must be clinically and statistically justified a priori. While both analyses are important for non-inferiority trials (with the PP analysis often considered primary or co-primary for efficacy assessment), this does not make an otherwise unacceptable margin acceptable.\n- The statement that an ITT analysis \"requires a larger margin\" is backward. Because ITT analysis tends to bias results toward the null (i.e., finding no difference), it can increase the risk of wrongly declaring non-inferiority. This argues for a *smaller*, more conservative margin, not a larger one.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $\\Delta_{NI}=1.0$ unit is not acceptable unless the constancy assumption is shown to be invalid; if the constancy assumption fails, a larger margin is needed to account for differences across trials.**\n- The constancy assumption (that the active comparator's effect is stable over time and across trials) is the very foundation upon which the historical estimate $L=1.4$ is used. If this assumption is invalid, the entire framework for calculating the margin collapses. One cannot simply use a \"larger margin.\" The failure of this assumption invalidates the non-inferiority trial design itself, or at least the justification for the margin based on historical data.\n- Furthermore, if the constancy assumption were to fail, the increased uncertainty would necessitate a *more* conservative (i.e., smaller) margin, not a larger one, to protect against an erroneous conclusion of non-inferiority. The logic presented is incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5074655"}]}
