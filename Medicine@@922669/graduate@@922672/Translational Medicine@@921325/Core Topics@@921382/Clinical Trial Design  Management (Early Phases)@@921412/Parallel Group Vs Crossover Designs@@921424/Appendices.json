The total number of subjects is $N = 2n$.\n- Sequence 1 ($j=1$): Treatment $A$ in period 1, Treatment $B$ in period 2.\n- Sequence 2 ($j=2$): Treatment $B$ in period 1, Treatment $A$ in period 2.\n\nThe statistical model for the observation, assuming no sequence effect, is:\n$Y_{ijk} = \\mu + S_{ij} + P_k + T_{t(j,k)} + \\epsilon_{ijk}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the overall mean, $S_{ij}$ is the random effect of subject $i$ in sequence $j$, $P_k$ is the fixed effect of period $k$, $T_{t(j,k)}$ is the fixed effect of the treatment administered in sequence $j$ and period $k$, and $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the within-subject random error. We are given that the errors are i.i.d. with $E[\\epsilon_{ijk}]=0$ and $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_{ijk}) = \\sigma_{w}^{2}$.\n\nThe primary analysis of a crossover trial utilizes the within-subject difference to eliminate the between-subject variability $S_{ij}$.\nFor a subject $i$ in Sequence 1 ($A \\rightarrow B$), the within-subject difference is:\n$D_{i1} = Y_{i12} - Y_{i11} = (P_2 - P_1) + (T_B - T_A) + (\\epsilon_{i12} - \\epsilon_{i11})$\nFor a subject $i$ in Sequence 2 ($B \\rightarrow A$), the difference is:\n$D_{i2} = Y_{i22} - Y_{i21} = (P_2 - P_1) + (T_A - T_B) + (\\epsilon_{i22} - \\epsilon_{i21})$\n\nThe problem states to assume negligible period effects, so $P_1 = P_2$.

We measure time $t$ starting from the point at which the peak concentration, $C_{peak}$, is achieved. The concentration at any subsequent time $t$ is given by:\n$$C(t) = C_{peak} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe elimination rate constant $k_e$ is related to the drug's terminal half-life, $t_{1/2}$.
