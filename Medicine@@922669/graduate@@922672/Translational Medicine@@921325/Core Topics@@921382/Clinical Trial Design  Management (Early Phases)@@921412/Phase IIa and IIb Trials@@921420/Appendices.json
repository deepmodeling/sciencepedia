It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of givens and foundational principles for deriving the required sample size formula. The problem is a standard, fundamental exercise in biostatistics and clinical trial design.\n\nLet the true mean change from baseline for the investigational agent be $\\mu_I$ and for the placebo be $\\mu_P$. The per-arm sample size is $n$, and the common standard deviation of individual observations is $\\sigma$. The null and alternative hypotheses for the two-sided test are:\n$$H_0: \\mu_I - \\mu_P = 0$$\n$$H_A: \\mu_I - \\mu_P \\neq 0$$\nLet $\\bar{X}_I$ and $\\bar{X}_P$ denote the sample means of the change-from-baseline values for the investigational and placebo arms, respectively. The test statistic is based on the difference of these sample means, $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P$.\n\nAccording to the first foundational element (Central Limit Theorem), the sampling distributions of the sample means are approximately normal:\n$$\\bar{X}_I \\sim N\\left(\\mu_I, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)$$\n$$\\bar{X}_P \\sim N\\left(\\mu_P, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)$$\nwhere $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ denotes a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n\nThe two arms are independent. Using the second foundational element, the variance of the difference of the sample means is the sum of their individual variances:\n$$\\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_I) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_P) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}$$\nThe standard error of the difference is the square root of this variance, $\\text{SE}(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$.\nSince $\\bar{X}_I$ and $\\bar{X}_P$ are approximately normally distributed, their difference is also approximately normally distributed:\n$$\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P \\sim N\\left(\\mu_I - \\mu_P, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)$$\n\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, $\\mu_I - \\mu_P = 0$, so the distribution of the difference in sample means is centered at $0$:\n$$\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P \\sim N\\left(0, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)$$\nThe standardized test statistic under $H_0$ is:\n$$Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P) - 0}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} \\sim N(0, 1)$$\n\nFor a two-sided test at a type I error level of $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if the test statistic falls in the extreme tails of the standard normal distribution. Based on the third foundational element, the critical values are $\\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2}$. The null hypothesis is rejected if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, which is equivalent to:\n$$|\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$$\nLet the upper boundary of this rejection region be denoted by $C = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$. We reject $H_0$ if $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P > C$ or $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P < -C$.\n\nNext, we impose the condition for statistical power. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the alternative hypothesis is true. The problem specifies a target power of $1-\\beta$ to detect a specific mean difference $\\Delta > 0$. We therefore consider the specific alternative hypothesis $H_A': \\mu_I - \\mu_P = \\Delta$.\nUnder $H_A'$, the sampling distribution of the difference is:\n$$\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P \\sim N\\left(\\Delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)$$\nPower is the probability of the observed difference falling into the rejection region, given that the true difference is $\\Delta$:\n$$\\text{Power} = P\\left(|\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P| > C \\mid \\mu_I - \\mu_P = \\Delta \\right) = 1-\\beta$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$P\\left(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P > C \\mid \\mu_I - \\mu_P = \\Delta\\right) + P\\left(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P < -C \\mid \\mu_I - \\mu_P = \\Delta\\right) = 1-\\beta$$\nSince $\\Delta > 0$ and $C > 0$, the mean of the distribution under the alternative hypothesis is shifted to the right. The probability of observing $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P < -C$ is negligible for typical power levels, so the power is dominated by the first term. Thus, we can approximate the power as:\n$$P\\left(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P > C \\mid \\mu_I - \\mu_P = \\Delta\\right) \\approx 1-\\beta$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the variable $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P$ using its distribution under $H_A'$:\n$$P\\left( \\frac{(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_P) - \\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} > \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} \\right) \\approx 1-\\beta$$\nThe random variable on the left is a standard normal variable, $Z' \\sim N(0,1)$. The condition becomes $P\\left(Z' > \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}\\right) \\approx 1-\\beta$.\nBy definition of the standard normal quantile function, the value that has an area of $1-\\beta$ to its right is $z_{1-\\beta}$. However, by symmetry of the normal distribution, the value that has an area of $\\beta$ to its right is $z_{1-\\beta}$, so the value that has an area of $\\beta$ to its left must be $-z_{1-\\beta}$. Therefore, for the probability of being greater than a value to be $1-\\beta$, that value must be $-z_{1-\\beta}$.\n$$\\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} = -z_{1-\\beta}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the critical value $C = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$ into this equation:\n$$\\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} - \\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} = -z_{1-\\beta}$$\nDividing the terms on the left side yields:\n$$z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} = -z_{1-\\beta}$$\nRearranging to solve for the term containing $n$:\n$$z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}$$\nNow, we isolate $\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{2} (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{\\Delta}$$\nFinally, we square both sides to obtain the expression for the required sample size per arm, $n$:\n$$n = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{2} (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{\\Delta}\\right)^2$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final closed-form solution:\n$$n = \\frac{2\\sigma^2(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2}$$\nThis expression can also be written as $n = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\Delta} \\right)^2 (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sigma^2(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2}}$$", "id": "5044167"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical calculations provide an ideal starting point, but robust trial planning requires anticipating real-world challenges.
