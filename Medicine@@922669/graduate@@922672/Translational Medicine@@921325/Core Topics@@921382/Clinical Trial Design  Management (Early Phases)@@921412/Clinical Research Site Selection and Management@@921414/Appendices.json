Mastering this calculation is essential for creating realistic recruitment forecasts and making data-driven decisions during site selection.

Let the total metro population be $P=3{,}000{,}000$. The sponsor wishes to estimate, from first principles, the expected number of eligible patients who will be accessible to the site within the catchment area during a one-year enrollment window. Use the following operational definitions grounded in standard epidemiology and clinical operations:\n\n- Disease prevalence is defined as the proportion of the population with the target condition at a point in time. Let the prevalence be $0.012$ (equivalently $1.2\\%$).\n- The care-access fraction is defined as the proportion of individuals with the condition who will present for care in the site’s catchment network during the enrollment window. Let this fraction be $0.6$.\n- The eligibility fraction is the proportion of individuals with the condition who meet all protocol inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Let this fraction be $0.25$.\n- The competing trial fraction is the proportion of otherwise eligible, care-accessing patients who are unavailable because they enroll in a competing trial in the same area and time window. Let this fraction be $0.1$.\n\nAssume independence of these filters across individuals and across stages (disease status, care access, eligibility determination, and competing enrollment), and model each individual’s pathway as a sequence of Bernoulli trials with these stage-specific probabilities.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in applied probability and statistics, using standard concepts from epidemiology and clinical trial operations to estimate an expected patient count. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe task is to derive from first principles the expected number of eligible patients accessible to a clinical research site. This can be modeled by considering the total population as a set of individuals, each undergoing a sequence of probabilistic filters. The expected number of individuals who pass all filters is the product of the initial population size and the combined probability of passing through each successive filter.\n\nLet $P$ represent the total metropolitan population. The value is given as $P = 3,000,000$.\n\nWe are given a sequence of fractions, which can be interpreted as probabilities for a randomly selected individual's pathway. Let us define these probabilities formally:\n- $p_{dis}$: The prevalence of the disease, which is the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population has the condition.\n  $p_{dis} = 0.012$.\n- $p_{care}$: The care-access fraction. This is the conditional probability that an individual with the condition accesses the relevant care network.\n  $p_{care} = 0.6$.\n- $p_{elig}$: The eligibility fraction. This is the conditional probability that an individual with the condition who has accessed care also meets the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n  $p_{elig} = 0.25$.\n- $p_{comp}$: The competing trial fraction. This is the conditional probability that an individual who is otherwise eligible and has accessed care is lost to a competing study.\n  $p_{comp} = 0.1$.\n\nThe problem states to assume independence between these stages. Therefore, we can find the overall probability of an individual becoming an accessible patient for this study by multiplying the probabilities of successfully passing each stage.\n\nLet $p_{accessible}$ be the probability that a single, randomly chosen individual from the total population becomes an eligible patient accessible to the site. This requires the individual to:\n1.  Have the disease (with probability $p_{dis}$).\n2.  Access care, given they have the disease (with probability $p_{care}$).\n3.  Be eligible, given they have the disease and access care (with probability $p_{elig}$).\n4.  Not enroll in a competing trial, given they are otherwise eligible and accessing care. The probability of enrolling in a competing trial is $p_{comp}$, so the probability of *not* enrolling is $(1 - p_{comp})$.\n\nDue to the assumed independence of these filtering stages, the overall probability is the product:\n$$p_{accessible} = p_{dis} \\times p_{care} \\times p_{elig} \\times (1 - p_{comp})$$\n\nThe expected number of accessible patients, $E[N]$, from a total population $P$ is found by applying the principle of linearity of expectation. If we define an indicator variable $X_i$ for each person $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., P\\}$, where $X_i = 1$ if person $i$ is an accessible eligible patient and $X_i = 0$ otherwise, then the expected value of $X_i$ is $E[X_i] = P(X_i=1) = p_{accessible}$. The total number of patients is $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{P} X_i$. The expected total number is:\n$$E[N] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{P} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{P} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{P} p_{accessible} = P \\times p_{accessible}$$\n\nSo, the expression for the expected number of patients is:\n$$E[N] = P \\cdot p_{dis} \\cdot p_{care} \\cdot p_{elig} \\cdot (1 - p_{comp})$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n- $P = 3,000,000$\n- $p_{dis} = 0.012$\n- $p_{care} = 0.6$\n- $p_{elig} = 0.25$\n- $p_{comp} = 0.1$\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of not being lost to a competing trial:\n$$1 - p_{comp} = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$$\n\nNext, calculate the overall probability, $p_{accessible}$:\n$$p_{accessible} = 0.012 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.9$$\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n$$0.012 \\times 0.6 = 0.0072$$\n$$0.0072 \\times 0.25 = 0.0072 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.0018$$\n$$0.0018 \\times 0.9 = 0.00162$$\nSo, $p_{accessible} = 0.00162$.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected number of patients, $E[N]$:\n$$E[N] = P \\times p_{accessible} = 3,000,000 \\times 0.00162$$\n$$E[N] = 3 \\times 10^6 \\times 1.62 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$E[N] = 3 \\times 1.62 \\times 10^{6-3}$$\n$$E[N] = 4.86 \\times 10^3$$\n$$E[N] = 4860$$\n\nThe problem requires an exact integer count, and our calculation results in the integer $4860$.

It presents a standard, formalizable scenario in translational medicine and clinical research operations.\n\nWe begin by defining the events and translating the given parameters into the language of probability.\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual from the catchment population has the disease.\nLet $D^c$ be the event that an individual does not have the disease.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the EHR prescreening algorithm returns a positive result (flags the individual).\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the algorithm returns a negative result.\n\nThe givens can be stated as:\nThe prevalence of the disease is $P(D) = 0.02$.\nThe sensitivity of the algorithm, which is the true positive rate, is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(T^+|D) = 0.85$.\nThe specificity of the algorithm, which is the true negative rate, is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.9$.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive two additional probabilities:\nThe probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\nThe false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent. Since the test can only be positive or negative, $P(T^+|D^c) + P(T^-|D^c) = 1$. Therefore, the false positive rate is $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that an individual truly has the disease given that the algorithm has flagged them as positive. In probabilistic terms, this is $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nWe start from the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be rewritten using the definition of conditional probability as $P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D)$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of testing positive. We can expand this term using the Law of Total Probability, considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur: the individual has the disease, or the individual does not have the disease.\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) $$\nAgain, applying the definition of conditional probability to each term:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nThis denominator represents the overall screen-positive rate of the algorithm.\n\nSubstituting these expanded forms back into the expression for $P(D|T^+)$ gives us the formula for PPV based on Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the PPV. It is often written in terms of sensitivity ($\\text{Sens}$), specificity ($\\text{Spec}$), and prevalence ($\\text{Prev}$):\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\text{Sens} \\cdot \\text{Prev}}{\\text{Sens} \\cdot \\text{Prev} + (1 - \\text{Spec}) \\cdot (1 - \\text{Prev})} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.02}{0.85 \\cdot 0.02 + (1 - 0.9) \\cdot (1 - 0.02)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.017}{0.017 + 0.1 \\cdot 0.98} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.017}{0.017 + 0.098} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.017}{0.115} \\approx 0.147826... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.1478$.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we analyze the interaction between PPV and the overall screen-positive rate to model the workload for clinical research coordinators.\nThe total workload is determined by the total number of positive alerts that require manual review. For a prescreened cohort of size $N$, the expected number of flagged individuals is $N \\times P(T^+)$. The probability $P(T^+)$ is the overall screen-positive rate, which we calculated as the denominator of the PPV expression:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.115 $$\nThis means $11.5\\%$ of the entire EHR cohort screened by the algorithm will be flagged for manual review, defining the total volume of work.\n\nThis workload consists of two distinct components:\n1.  **True Positives (TP)**: These are individuals who actually have the disease and are correctly flagged. The expected number of true positives in a cohort of size $N$ is:\n    $$ E[\\text{TP}] = N \\times P(D \\cap T^+) = N \\times P(T^+|D)P(D) = N \\times 0.85 \\times 0.02 = 0.017N $$\n    These cases represent the \"valuable\" work, as they are potentially eligible for the trial.\n\n2.  **False Positives (FP)**: These are individuals who do not have the disease but are incorrectly flagged. The expected number of false positives in a cohort of size $N$ is:\n    $$ E[\\text{FP}] = N \\times P(D^c \\cap T^+) = N \\times P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) = N \\times (1 - 0.9) \\times (1 - 0.02) = N \\times 0.1 \\times 0.98 = 0.098N $$\n    These cases represent wasted effort, as coordinators must review these charts only to find the patients are ineligible.\n\nThe PPV is the ratio of true positives to all positives: $\\text{PPV} = \\frac{E[\\text{TP}]}{E[\\text{TP}] + E[\\text{FP}]}$. A low PPV, such as the $0.1478$ calculated here, signifies that the overwhelming majority of the workload ($1 - \\text{PPV} \\approx 85.22\\%$) consists of reviewing false positives. For every $\\approx 100$ charts reviewed, only about $15$ will be for patients who actually have the disease.\n\nDuring clinical research site selection and management, this analysis is critical for staffing and resource allocation.\nThe **overall screen-positive rate** ($P(T^+) = 0.115$) dictates the **total volume** of review work. A site with a catchment population $N = 100,000$ would generate an expected $11,500$ charts for manual review.\nThe **PPV** ($0.1478$) dictates the **efficiency** of this work. Of the $11,500$ charts, only $11,500 \\times 0.1478 \\approx 1,700$ would be true positives, while the remaining $\\approx 9,800$ would be false positives.\nTherefore, when selecting a site, managers must not only consider the size of the patient population but also the expected workload generated by the screening algorithm. An algorithm with low specificity ($0.9$ is modest) applied to a population with low disease prevalence ($0.02$) characteristically results in a low PPV. This leads to a high volume of false positives, which can overwhelm site staff. Staffing decisions must account for the large amount of time coordinators will spend ruling out ineligible patients.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information and definitions for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the givens from the problem statement:\n- Number of identical infusion chairs, $C = 6$.\n- Average infusion time per patient (processing time), $T_{infusion} = 2$ hours.\n- Chair turnover interval (setup time), $T_{turnover} = 0.5$ hours.\n- Daily operating hours, $H_{day} = 8$ hours.\n- Weekly operating days, $D_{week} = 5$ days.\n\nThe problem provides explicit definitions that must be followed. The service cycle time for a single server (an infusion chair) is defined as the sum of the processing time and the turnover time. Let $T_{cycle}$ represent this service cycle time.\n$$T_{cycle} = T_{infusion} + T_{turnover}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_{cycle} = 2 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 2.5 \\text{ hours}$$\nThis means that to complete one infusion and prepare the chair for the next patient, a total of $2.5$ hours are required.\n\nNext, the problem defines the maximum number of complete jobs per server within a finite horizon as the integer count of full cycles that fit within the available time. This is a crucial instruction, as it implies that a full cycle (infusion plus turnover) must be completed within the operating hours for it to be counted, and that partial cycles are not permitted. We can calculate the maximum number of infusions per chair per day, denoted as $N_{chair, day}$, by finding how many full $T_{cycle}$ periods fit into the daily operating hours, $H_{day}$. This is mathematically equivalent to applying the floor function.\n$$N_{chair, day} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{H_{day}}{T_{cycle}} \\right\\rfloor$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$N_{chair, day} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{8 \\text{ hours}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 3.2 \\rfloor = 3$$\nThus, a single infusion chair can accommodate a maximum of $3$ complete patient infusions per day. For example, cycles could run from hour $0$ to $2.5$, $2.5$ to $5.0$, and $5.0$ to $7.5$. A fourth infusion could not be completed as it requires the chair until hour $9.5$ ($7.5 + 2$), which is beyond the $8$-hour operating day.\n\nThe total daily capacity of the unit is the capacity per chair multiplied by the number of chairs, as they operate independently and in parallel.
