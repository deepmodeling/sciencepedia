The one-compartment model with first-order elimination is a fundamental and widely used model in pharmacokinetics, especially for initial approximations in early-phase clinical development. The concepts of half-life, washout period, and residual drug concentration are standard in clinical pharmacology. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective and a quantifiable criterion ($ 0.05$ residual fraction). The language is objective and precise. The provided data and assumptions are self-contained, consistent, and do not violate scientific principles. The half-life value of $11.7$ hours is realistic for a therapeutic molecule. The structure of the problem, requiring a derivation from first principles followed by a specific calculation, is logical.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe elimination of the drug is described by first-order kinetics. Let $C(t)$ be the plasma concentration of the drug at time $t$, and let $k$ be the first-order elimination rate constant. The governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t) $$\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can solve it by integrating, given the initial condition that at time $t=0$, the concentration is the post-distribution peak concentration, which we denote as $C_0$.\n$$ \\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{dC'}{C'} = -k \\int_0^t d\\tau $$\nSolving the integrals gives:\n$$ \\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -kt $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the equation for first-order decay:\n$$ C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease to one-half of its initial value. At $t = t_{1/2}$, we have $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{C_0}{2}$. Substituting this into the decay equation:\n$$ \\frac{C_0}{2} = C_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for $k$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} $$\nThis gives the relationship between the elimination rate constant and the half-life:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nThe problem requires a washout period, $t_w$, such that the residual concentration fraction is less than $0.05$. The residual fraction at time $t_w$ is $\\frac{C(t_w)}{C_0}$. The criterion is:\n$$ \\frac{C(t_w)}{C_0}  0.05 $$\nUsing the decay equation, this is equivalent to:\n$$ \\exp(-kt_w)  0.05 $$\nThe problem asks to determine the smallest integer number of half-lives, $n$, that satisfies this criterion. We set the washout period $t_w$ to be an integer multiple of the half-life: $t_w = n \\times t_{1/2}$. Substituting this and the expression for $k$ into the inequality:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} \\cdot n \\cdot t_{1/2}\\right)  0.05 $$\n$$ \\exp(-n \\ln(2))  0.05 $$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\exp(-n \\ln(2)) = \\exp(\\ln(2^{-n})) = 2^{-n}$, the inequality becomes:\n$$ 2^{-n}  0.05 $$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since the natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$ \\ln(2^{-n})  \\ln(0.05) $$\n$$ -n \\ln(2)  \\ln(0.05) $$\nTo isolate $n$, we divide by $-\\ln(2)$. Since $\\ln(2)$ is positive, $-\\ln(2)$ is negative, so we must reverse the inequality sign:\n$$ n  -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nWe can simplify the logarithmic term: $\\ln(0.05) = \\ln(\\frac{1}{20}) = -\\ln(20)$.\n$$ n  \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of this ratio:\n$$ n  \\frac{2.99573227...}{0.69314718...} \\approx 4.321928... $$\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality is $n=5$. This fulfills the first two objectives of the problem.\n\nThe final objective is to compute the specific washout period in hours for a drug with $t_{1/2} = 11.7$ hours, using the integer number of half-lives, $n=5$.\nThe washout period is calculated as:\n$$ t_w = n \\times t_{1/2} $$\n$$ t_w = 5 \\times 11.7 \\text{ hours} $$\n$$ t_w = 58.5 \\text{ hours} $$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $58.5$ has three significant figures. To express this with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$ t_w = 58.50 \\text{ hours} $$\nThis washout period ensures the criterion is met. After $5$ half-lives, the remaining fraction of the drug is $(1/2)^5 = 1/32 = 0.03125$, which is indeed less than the required threshold of $0.05$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{58.50}$$", "id": "5043762"}, {"introduction": "Following the characterization of single-dose safety and pharmacokinetics, trials typically progress to a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) phase to understand the drug's behavior under a regimen more like its intended therapeutic use.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the accumulation factor based on first principles and its subsequent use to predict steady-state exposure.\n\n**Derivation of the Accumulation Factor ($R$)**\n\nThe assumption of linear pharmacokinetics implies that the system is linear and time-invariant (LTI). Therefore, the principle of superposition applies. The concentration of the drug in plasma at any time under a multiple-dosing regimen is the sum of the concentrations remaining from all previous doses.\n\nFor a single dose with negligible absorption time, the concentration-time profile, $C_1(t)$, follows first-order exponential decay:\n$$C_1(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the initial concentration at $t=0$ and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nUnder a multiple-dosing regimen where the same dose is given every $\\tau$ hours, the concentration at a time $t'$ within any dosing interval at steady state is the sum of the contributions from the current dose and all preceding doses:\n$C_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t') = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_1(t' + n\\tau) \\quad \\text{for } t' \\in [0, \\tau)$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_1(t)$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t') = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_0 \\exp(-k_e(t' + n\\tau)) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t') \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-k_e n\\tau)$$\nThe summation is a geometric series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} r^n$ with the ratio $r = \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$.

For concentration, it is the ratio of the steady-state concentration to the single-dose concentration at the same time $t'$ within the dosing interval:\n$$R = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t')}{C_1(t')} = \\frac{C_0 \\exp(-k_e t') \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} \\right)}{C_0 \\exp(-k_e t')} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the accumulation factor.\n\n**Prediction of Steady-State AUC ($\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}}$)**\n\nThe problem asks to use this accumulation factor to predict the area under the concentration-time curve over one dosing interval at steady state, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}}$.\nThe $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}}$ is the integral of the steady-state concentration over one dosing interval, from $t'=0$ to $t'=\\tau$:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t') dt'$$\nUsing the derived expression for $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t')$:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} \\right) C_0 \\exp(-k_e t') dt'$$\nThe term representing the accumulation factor is a constant with respect to the integration variable $t'$:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} \\right) \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_1(t') dt'$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_1(t') dt'$ is, by definition, the area under the curve for a single dose from time $0$ to $\\tau$, i.e., $\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\text{–}\\tau}$.\nTherefore, we arrive at the predictive relationship:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}} = R \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\text{–}\\tau} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\text{–}\\tau}}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nThis equation allows the prediction of steady-state exposure from single-dose data.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the elimination rate constant $k_e$ from the given half-life $t_{1/2} = 10$ h:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10} \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\nThe dosing interval is $\\tau = 12$ h.
