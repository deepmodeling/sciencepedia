The pre-consent screening step applies four objective eligibility criteria to referred patients: biomarker positivity, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status $0$–$1$, adequate organ function, and absence of untreated brain metastases. The following design inputs, based on registry data and a feasibility pilot, are adopted for the protocol:\n\n- Biomarker positivity among referred patients occurs with probability $P(B)=0.30$.\n- ECOG $0$–$1$ occurs with probability $P(E)=0.75$.\n- Adequate organ function $A$ is correlated with ECOG: $P(A\\mid E)=0.93$ and $P(A\\mid E^{c})=0.60$.\n- Absence of untreated brain metastases $M$ occurs with probability $P(M)=0.85$.\n- Independence assumptions for protocol planning: the pair $(B,M)$ is independent of the pair $(E,A)$, and $B$ is independent of $M$. The correlation between $E$ and $A$ is as given above and is the only dependence among criteria.\n\nA referred patient is screen-eligible if and only if $B \\cap E \\cap A \\cap M$ holds. Patients who are screen-eligible are approached for consent; among those approached, $0.90$ provide informed consent. Among consented patients, $0.95$ pass central confirmation of eligibility without additional failure. Randomization occurs immediately after central confirmation.\n\nThe trial targets $N=120$ randomized patients. For feasibility oversight, after the first $m=60$ completed pre-consent screenings, the sponsor will trigger a feasibility review if the observed number of screening failures is “too high” relative to the protocol plan under the screening-failure probability implied by the inputs above. Specifically, under a binomial model for the number of failures among the first $m$ screens with failure probability equal to the planned value, define the one-sided upper monitoring threshold $k^{\\ast}$ as the smallest integer such that the binomial right-tail probability is at most $\\alpha=0.10$.

It is scientifically grounded in probability theory and its application to clinical trial design, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of givens, and expressed in objective, formal language. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part calculation:\n1) Derivation of the pre-consent screening-failure probability, $p_{\\mathrm{fail}}$.\n2) Derivation and calculation of the expected number of patients to be referred to achieve $N=120$ randomizations.\n3) Determination of the feasibility monitoring threshold, $k^{\\ast}$.\n\n**Part 1: Pre-consent Screening-Failure Probability ($p_{\\mathrm{fail}}$)**\n\nA referred patient is screen-eligible if they satisfy all four criteria simultaneously. Let $S_{succ}$ denote the event of a successful pre-consent screening. This event is the intersection of the four individual criteria events: biomarker positivity ($B$), ECOG performance status $0$–$1$ ($E$), adequate organ function ($A$), and absence of untreated brain metastases ($M$).\n$$S_{succ} = B \\cap E \\cap A \\cap M$$\nThe probability of this event, $p_{succ} = P(S_{succ})$, is the probability of a patient being screen-eligible. The problem states that the pair of events $(B,M)$ is independent of the pair $(E,A)$. Therefore, the joint probability can be factored as:\n$$p_{succ} = P(B \\cap M \\cap E \\cap A) = P(B \\cap M) P(E \\cap A)$$\nThe problem further states that $B$ and $M$ are independent events. Thus, their joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(B \\cap M) = P(B) P(M)$$\nThe problem specifies the dependence between $E$ and $A$ via the conditional probability $P(A \\mid E)$. The joint probability of $E$ and $A$ is given by the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(E \\cap A) = P(A \\mid E) P(E)$$\nNote that for a patient to be eligible, they must satisfy criterion $E$. The information regarding $P(A \\mid E^c)$ is not required for calculating the success probability, as any patient in the state $E^c$ has already failed the screening.\n\nCombining these expressions, the probability of a successful screening is:\n$$p_{succ} = P(B) P(M) P(A \\mid E) P(E)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$P(B) = 0.30$\n$P(M) = 0.85$\n$P(E) = 0.75$\n$P(A \\mid E) = 0.93$\n$$p_{succ} = (0.30) \\times (0.85) \\times (0.93) \\times (0.75)$$\n$$p_{succ} = (0.255) \\times (0.6975) = 0.1778625$$\nThe pre-consent screening-failure probability, $p_{\\mathrm{fail}}$, is the complement of the success probability:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{fail}} = 1 - p_{succ} = 1 - 0.1778625 = 0.8221375$$\n\n**Part 2: Expected Number of Referred Patients**\n\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{rand}}$ be the overall probability that a single referred patient is eventually randomized. A patient must pass three sequential hurdles: pre-consent screening (eligibility), informed consent, and central confirmation.\nThe probability of passing pre-consent screening is $p_{succ} = 0.1778625$.\nThe probability of a screen-eligible patient providing consent is $P(\\text{Consent} \\mid S_{succ}) = 0.90$.\nThe probability of a consented patient passing central confirmation is $P(\\text{Confirm} \\mid \\text{Consent}) = 0.95$.\n\nThe probability of a referred patient being randomized is the product of these probabilities:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{rand}} = P(S_{succ}) \\times P(\\text{Consent} \\mid S_{succ}) \\times P(\\text{Confirm} \\mid \\text{Consent})$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{rand}} = 0.1778625 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.95$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{rand}} = 0.1778625 \\times 0.855 = 0.1520724375$$\nThe process of finding randomized patients can be modeled as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, where success is randomizing a patient with probability $p_{\\mathrm{rand}}$. The number of trials (referred patients), $K$, required to obtain a fixed number of successes, $N$, follows a negative binomial distribution. The expected value of $K$ is given by:\n$$E[K] = \\frac{N}{p_{\\mathrm{rand}}}$$\nWith the target $N=120$ randomized patients:\n$$E[K] = \\frac{120}{0.1520724375} \\approx 789.1118$$\nSo, the expected number of patients that must be referred to the study to randomize $120$ is approximately $789.11$.\n\n**Part 3: Feasibility Review Threshold ($k^{\\ast}$)**\n\nThe feasibility review is based on the number of screening failures, $X$, in the first $m=60$ screenings. This process is modeled as a binomial experiment, $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(m, p_{\\mathrm{fail}})$, where the number of trials is $m=60$ and the probability of failure on any trial is $p_{\\mathrm{fail}} = 0.8221375$.\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer threshold $k^{\\ast}$ such that the probability of observing $k^{\\ast}$ or more failures is at most $\\alpha=0.10$.\n$$P(X \\ge k^{\\ast}) \\le 0.10$$\nThe problem permits the use of a normal approximation to the binomial distribution, with a continuity correction. First, we compute the mean ($\\mu$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of the binomial distribution:\n$$\\mu = m \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{fail}} = 60 \\times 0.8221375 = 49.32825$$\n$$\\sigma^2 = m \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{fail}} (1 - p_{\\mathrm{fail}}) = 60 \\times 0.8221375 \\times (1 - 0.8221375) = 49.32825 \\times 0.1778625 \\approx 8.77353$$\n$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2} \\approx 2.9619806$$\nThe condition $m \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{fail}} \\approx 49.3 > 5$ and $m(1-p_{\\mathrm{fail}}) \\approx 10.7 > 5$ confirms that the normal approximation is appropriate.\n\nApplying the continuity correction, the probability $P(X \\ge k^{\\ast})$ is approximated by $P(Y \\ge k^{\\ast} - 0.5)$, where $Y \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. We standardize this to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$:\n$$P\\left(Z \\ge \\frac{(k^{\\ast} - 0.5) - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\le 0.10$$\nThe critical value $z_{0.10}$ from the standard normal distribution, for which $P(Z \\ge z_{0.10}) = 0.10$, is approximately $z_{0.10} \\approx 1.28155$.\nThus, we must have:\n$$\\frac{(k^{\\ast} - 0.5) - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\ge z_{0.10}$$\nSolving for $k^{\\ast}$:\n$$k^{\\ast} - 0.5 \\ge \\mu + z_{0.10} \\sigma$$\n$$k^{\\ast} \\ge \\mu + 0.5 + z_{0.10} \\sigma$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$k^{\\ast} \\ge 49.32825 + 0.5 + (1.28155)(2.9619806)$$\n$$k^{\\ast} \\ge 49.82825 + 3.79580$$\n$$k^{\\ast} \\ge 53.62405$$\nSince $k^{\\ast}$ must be an integer, the smallest integer satisfying this inequality is $k^{\\ast}=54$.\n\nTo verify, we can check the approximate probabilities for $k=53$ and $k=54$:\nFor $k^{\\ast}=54$, we test $P(X \\ge 54) \\approx P(Y \\ge 53.5)$:\n$$z = \\frac{53.5 - 49.32825}{2.9619806} = \\frac{4.17175}{2.9619806} \\approx 1.4084$$\n$P(Z \\ge 1.4084) \\approx 0.0795$, which is less than $0.10$.\n\nFor $k=53$, we test $P(X \\ge 53) \\approx P(Y \\ge 52.5)$:\n$$z = \\frac{52.5 - 49.32825}{2.9619806} = \\frac{3.17175}{2.9619806} \\approx 1.0708$$\n$P(Z \\ge 1.0708) \\approx 0.1421$, which is greater than $0.10$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer number of failures that would trigger the review is $54$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{54}$$", "id": "4998783"}, {"introduction": "Modern clinical trials must precisely define the scientific question being answered through a formal estimand, especially when events like treatment switching are anticipated.

The scientific question is framed using the intention-to-treat (ITT) treatment policy estimand in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9 addendum (R1) terms: the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) up to a fixed horizon between groups defined by randomization, regardless of intercurrent events such as treatment switching. Let the time horizon be $H=12$ months.\n\nSuppose that survival times are well approximated by exponential models with constant hazards by assigned arm. Specifically, participants randomized to experimental therapy have hazard $\\lambda_{E}=0.05 \\text{ month}^{-1}$, and those randomized to control have hazard $\\lambda_{C}=0.10 \\text{ month}^{-1}$, up to administrative censoring at $H$. In the control arm, a protocol-permitted treatment switch occurs at calendar time $s=6$ months: among those alive and under observation at $t=s$, an independent Bernoulli draw with probability $p=0.40$ assigns a participant to switch permanently to the experimental therapy. After switching, the hazard for a switcher instantaneously changes to $\\lambda_{E}$ for $t\\ge s$; non-switchers remain at hazard $\\lambda_{C}$ for all $t$. Assume that, conditional on being alive at $t=s$ and randomized arm, the switching probability $p$ is independent of the potential failure time processes.\n\nAn analyst, mistakenly believing that censoring at switching is compatible with the ITT estimand, censors control-arm participants at the switching time $s$ if they switch, and then computes the control-arm RMST using the Kaplan–Meier estimator under the independent censoring model.

Correct ITT Control-Arm Survival Function and RMST**\n\nThe intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, in the context of the treatment-policy estimand, requires that participant outcomes are attributed to their randomized arm, regardless of intercurrent events like treatment switching. The switching event is part of the treatment policy for the control arm.\n\nThe survival function for the control arm, $S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(t)$, must be derived piecewise.\n-   For the time interval $t \\in [0, s)$, all participants in the control arm are subject to the hazard $\\lambda_{C}$. Thus, the survival function is:\n    $$S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} t), \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t < s$$\n-   At time $t=s=6$ months, for the cohort of patients who have survived to this point (with probability $S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(s) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s)$), a fraction $p$ switches to the experimental therapy (hazard $\\lambda_{E}$) and a fraction $1-p$ remains on control (hazard $\\lambda_{C}$).\n-   For the time interval $t \\in [s, H]$, the survival probability $S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(t)$ is the probability of surviving to $s$ multiplied by the conditional probability of surviving from $s$ to $t$. The latter is a mixture of the survival probabilities of the two subgroups (switchers and non-switchers).\n    $$P(\\text{survival time} > t | \\text{survival time} > s) = p \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) + (1-p) \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s))$$\n    Therefore, for $t \\ge s$:\n    $$S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(t) = S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(s) \\cdot \\left[ p \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) + (1-p) \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) \\right]$$\n    $$S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ p \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) + (1-p)\\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) \\right], \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge s$$\nThe corresponding correct RMST, $\\mathrm{RMST}_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(H)$, is the integral of this piecewise function from $0$ to $H$:\n$$\\mathrm{RMST}_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(H) = \\int_0^s \\exp(-\\lambda_C t) dt + \\int_s^H \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ p \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) + (1-p)\\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) \\right] dt$$\nThe first integral is $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_C}[1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_C s)]$.\nThe second integral is:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ p \\int_s^H \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) dt + (1-p) \\int_s^H \\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) dt \\right]$$\n$$= \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ \\frac{p}{\\lambda_E} [1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_E(H-s))] + \\frac{1-p}{\\lambda_C} [1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_C(H-s))] \\right]$$\nThus,\n$$\\mathrm{RMST}_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(H) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_C s)}{\\lambda_C} + \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left( \\frac{p}{\\lambda_E} [1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_E(H-s))] + \\frac{1-p}{\\lambda_C} [1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_C(H-s))] \\right)$$\n\n**2. Analyst's Naive Control-Arm Survival Function and RMST**\n\nThe analyst's error is to censor switchers at time $s$ and proceed with a Kaplan-Meier analysis under the assumption of independent censoring. In this parametric model, this procedure implicitly targets a survival function for a hypothetical population that is *always* subject to the hazard $\\lambda_{C}$, as if no one ever switched. The dependent nature of the censoring (switching changes the hazard, so it is related to the future failure time process) is ignored. The survival function estimated by this naive method is:\n$$S_{C}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} t), \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le H$$\nThe corresponding naive RMST is the integral of this function:\n$$\\mathrm{RMST}_{C}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(H) = \\int_0^H \\exp(-\\lambda_C t) dt = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_C} [1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_C H)]$$\n\n**3. Bias Calculation**\n\nThe bias is defined as $\\mathrm{RMST}_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(H) - \\mathrm{RMST}_{C}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(H)$. We can compute this by taking the difference of the integrals. The integrals from $t=0$ to $t=s$ are identical for both the true and naive calculations, so they cancel. The bias arises entirely from the difference in the survival functions over the interval $[s, H]$.\n$$\\text{Bias} = \\int_s^H \\left( S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(t) - S_{C}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(t) \\right) dt$$\nThe difference inside the integral is:\n$$S_{C}^{\\mathrm{true}}(t) - S_{C}^{\\mathrm{naive}}(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ p \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) + (1-p)\\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) \\right] - \\exp(-\\lambda_C t)$$\n$$= \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ p \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) + (1-p)\\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) - \\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) \\right]$$\n$$= \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ p \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) - p\\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) \\right]$$\n$$= p \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) - \\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) \\right]$$\nNow, we integrate this difference from $s$ to $H$:\n$$\\text{Bias} = \\int_s^H p \\exp(-\\lambda_{C} s) \\left[ \\exp(-\\lambda_{E}(t-s)) - \\exp(-\\lambda_{C}(t-s)) \\right] dt$$\nLet $u=t-s$, so $du=dt$.

An appropriate method is inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). For a control-arm patient $i$ who does not switch at time $s$ (and is thus not censored), their data for $t \\ge s$ would be up-weighted to account for the $p=0.40$ portion of the risk set that was \"censored\" by switching. The stabilized weight $W_i(t)$ for a non-switcher would be:\n$$W_i(t) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } t < s \\\\ \\frac{1}{1-p} & \\text{if } t \\ge s \\end{cases}$$\nThe weight is $1$ before the intercurrent event and becomes $1/(1-0.40) = 1.667$ for those who remain on control after $s$. These weights are then used in a weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator or a weighted Cox model. The numerator of the stabilized weight is $1$ as there are no covariates in the model to stabilize over.\n\n**Correct Analysis for the ITT Treatment-Policy Estimand:** To correctly analyze the study for the specified ITT treatment-policy estimand, no special methods like IPCW are needed. The intercurrent event of switching is part of the defined treatment strategy for the control arm. The correct analysis is to follow all patients as randomized until the event of interest (death) or administrative censoring at $H=12$ months, **without censoring at the time of treatment switch**. The resulting survival data for the control arm will reflect the mixture of experiences (some switch, some do not), and a standard unweighted Kaplan-Meier estimator applied to this data will provide a consistent estimate of $S_C^{\\mathrm{true}}(t)$. The difference in RMSTs calculated from the standard, unweighted Kaplan-Meier curves for each arm yields a valid estimate of the ITT treatment effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1475}$$", "id": "4998718"}, {"introduction": "Adaptive designs allow for pre-planned modifications to a trial based on accumulating data, enhancing efficiency and ethical conduct. A key tool in this process is conditional power, which assesses the probability of future success given the results observed at an interim analysis [@problem_id:4998728]. This exercise will guide you through the derivation and calculation of conditional power, providing insight into how Data Monitoring Committees make crucial decisions about continuing, stopping, or modifying a trial.", "problem": "A translational medicine Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is evaluating a biomarker-guided therapy on a continuous primary endpoint, assumed approximately normally distributed with a common variance across arms. The confirmatory analysis is a two-sided superiority test at type I error rate $\\alpha = 0.05$, with superiority declared for a benefit in the positive direction. Equal allocation is used. The planned maximum sample size is $N_{\\text{final}} = 200$ per arm. An interim analysis is scheduled after $N_{1} = 80$ per arm. The pooled sample variance estimate at interim is $s^{2} = 225$ and is assumed stable for planning. The observed interim mean difference (treatment minus control) is $\\hat{d}_{1} = 3.0$ (in the endpoint’s native units).\n\nAssume the large-sample normal approximation for the difference in means and the additivity of Fisher information. Treat the observed interim effect as the working alternative for predictive assessment; that is, assume the true mean difference $\\delta$ equals the observed interim estimate $\\hat{d}_{1}$. Using only these assumptions, derive from first principles the conditional distribution of the final $Z$-statistic given the interim data, and from it, the conditional power to reject the null hypothesis at the planned final analysis. Use the two-sided normal-theory critical value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ for the final boundary. Compute the numerical value of this conditional power.\n\nThe Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will apply the following thresholds for adaptation: if the conditional power is less than $0.2$, consider non-binding futility stopping; if it lies in $[0.2, 0.8)$, consider sample size re-estimation targeting conditional power $0.9$; if it is at least $0.8$, continue as planned. However, for this question, only report the conditional power value.\n\nExpress the conditional power as a decimal (not a percentage) and round to four significant figures. Do not report any decision; report only the computed conditional power.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard statistical theory for clinical trials, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is stated objectively.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the conditional distribution of the final test statistic given the interim results, and then computing the conditional power for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nLet $\\delta$ be the true mean difference between the treatment and control arms. The endpoint is a continuous variable assumed to be normally distributed with a common variance $\\sigma^2$ in both arms. The problem supplies a pooled sample variance estimate $s^2 = 225$, which we will use as the true population variance $\\sigma^2$ for planning purposes, so $\\sigma^2 = 225$.\n\nLet $N_1$ be the sample size per arm at the interim analysis and $N_{\\text{final}}$ be the total planned sample size per arm. We are given $N_1 = 80$ and $N_{\\text{final}} = 200$.\n\nThe estimate of the mean difference at the interim analysis is $\\hat{d}_1$. Under the large-sample approximation, $\\hat{d}_1$ is normally distributed:\n$$ \\hat{d}_1 \\sim N\\left(\\delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N_1}\\right) $$\nThe corresponding $Z$-statistic at the interim analysis, $Z_1$, is given by:\n$$ Z_1 = \\frac{\\hat{d}_1}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2 / N_1}} \\sim N\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2 / N_1}}, 1\\right) $$\nThe final estimate of the mean difference, $\\hat{d}_{\\text{final}}$, based on $N_{\\text{final}}$ subjects per arm, is also normally distributed:\n$$ \\hat{d}_{\\text{final}} \\sim N\\left(\\delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N_{\\text{final}}}\\right) $$\nThe final $Z$-statistic, $Z_{\\text{final}}$, is:\n$$ Z_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{\\hat{d}_{\\text{final}}}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2 / N_{\\text{final}}}} \\sim N\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2 / N_{\\text{final}}}}, 1\\right) $$\nDue to the sequential nature of data collection, with the data at the final analysis including the data from the interim analysis, the statistics $Z_1$ and $Z_{\\text{final}}$ are not independent. Their joint distribution is approximately bivariate normal. The covariance between them is:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(Z_1, Z_{\\text{final}}) = \\text{Cov}\\left(\\frac{\\hat{d}_1}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/N_1}}, \\frac{\\hat{d}_{\\text{final}}}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/N_{\\text{final}}}}\\right) $$\nSince $\\hat{d}_{\\text{final}}$ is the average difference over all $N_{\\text{final}}$ subjects, and $\\hat{d}_1$ is the average over the first $N_1$ subjects, we can write $\\hat{d}_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{N_1 \\hat{d}_1 + (N_{\\text{final}}-N_1)\\hat{d}_2}{N_{\\text{final}}}$, where $\\hat{d}_2$ is the estimate from the new subjects enrolled after the interim analysis. As $\\hat{d}_1$ and $\\hat{d}_2$ are independent, $\\text{Cov}(\\hat{d}_1, \\hat{d}_{\\text{final}}) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{d}_1)\\frac{N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N_1}\\frac{N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N_{\\text{final}}}$.\nSubstituting this into the covariance for the $Z$-statistics:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(Z_1, Z_{\\text{final}}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/N_1}\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/N_{\\text{final}}}}\\text{Cov}(\\hat{d}_1, \\hat{d}_{\\text{final}}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_1 N_{\\text{final}}}}{2\\sigma^2} \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N_{\\text{final}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}}} $$\nSince the variances are both $1$, this is also their correlation, $\\rho = \\sqrt{N_1/N_{\\text{final}}}$.\nSo, $(Z_1, Z_{\\text{final}})$ follow a bivariate normal distribution:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} Z_1 \\\\ Z_{\\text{final}} \\end{pmatrix} \\sim N\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta\\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{2\\sigma^2}} \\\\ \\delta\\sqrt{\\frac{N_{\\text{final}}}{2\\sigma^2}} \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}}} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\nFrom the properties of the bivariate normal distribution, the conditional distribution of $Z_{\\text{final}}$ given the observed value $Z_1 = z_1$ is also normal. The parameters of this conditional distribution are:\nConditional Mean: $E[Z_{\\text{final}}|Z_1=z_1] = E[Z_{\\text{final}}] + \\rho(z_1 - E[Z_1])$\n$$ E[Z_{\\text{final}}|Z_1=z_1] = \\delta\\sqrt{\\frac{N_{\\text{final}}}{2\\sigma^2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}}}\\left(z_1 - \\delta\\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{2\\sigma^2}}\\right) $$\nConditional Variance: $\\text{Var}(Z_{\\text{final}}|Z_1=z_1) = \\text{Var}(Z_{\\text{final}})(1 - \\rho^2)$\n$$ \\text{Var}(Z_{\\text{final}}|Z_1=z_1) = 1 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}}\\right) = \\frac{N_{\\text{final}}-N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}} $$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nThe problem states that for predictive assessment, we must assume the true mean difference $\\delta$ is equal to the observed interim estimate $\\hat{d}_1$. Given $\\hat{d}_1 = 3.0$, we set $\\delta = 3.0$.\nUnder this assumption, the expected value of $Z_1$, $E[Z_1]$, becomes numerically equal to the observed value $z_1$:\n$$ E[Z_1] = \\delta\\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{2\\sigma^2}} = \\hat{d}_1\\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{2\\sigma^2}} = \\frac{\\hat{d}_1}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/N_1}} = z_1 $$\nSubstituting this result ($E[Z_1] = z_1$) into the formula for the conditional mean simplifies it significantly:\n$$ E[Z_{\\text{final}}|Z_1=z_1, \\delta=\\hat{d}_1] = \\delta\\sqrt{\\frac{N_{\\text{final}}}{2\\sigma^2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}}}(z_1 - z_1) = \\delta\\sqrt{\\frac{N_{\\text{final}}}{2\\sigma^2}} = \\hat{d}_1\\sqrt{\\frac{N_{\\text{final}}}{2\\sigma^2}} $$\nThus, the conditional distribution of $Z_{\\text{final}}$ given the interim data and the assumption $\\delta = \\hat{d}_1$ is:\n$$ Z_{\\text{final}} | (\\text{data at interim}) \\sim N\\left(\\hat{d}_1\\sqrt{\\frac{N_{\\text{final}}}{2\\sigma^2}}, \\frac{N_{\\text{final}}-N_1}{N_{\\text{final}}}\\right) $$\nConditional power (CP) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0: \\delta=0$ at the final analysis, given this conditional distribution. For a two-sided test at significance level $\\alpha=0.05$, rejection occurs if $|Z_{\\text{final}}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$. As the observed effect is positive ($\\hat{d}_1 = 3.0$), we are interested in the probability of rejecting in the positive direction, $Z_{\\text{final}} > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\n$$ \\text{CP} = P(Z_{\\text{final}} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} | \\text{interim data}, \\delta=\\hat{d}_1) $$\nLet $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ be the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
