The formulas for these are well-established in medicine and biostatistics. The provided physiological data (height, weight, age, serum creatinine) are within realistic human ranges. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mostly well-posed. The \"standard operational definition\" of BMI is unambiguous. The phrase \"a widely used, well-tested clinical estimation for creatinine clearance applicable to adult males\" is slightly ambiguous, as several such equations exist (e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, MDRD, CKD-EPI). However, the Cockcroft-Gault equation is the most classic and direct estimator of creatinine clearance ($C_{Cr}$) in $\\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min}$, fitting the description and the required units perfectly. The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations primarily estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), often normalized to body surface area. Given the context of a specified \"computational definition\" in an EDC system and the required units, it is a reasonable and necessary assumption that the Cockcroft-Gault equation is the intended formula. The presence of two different weights ($72\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ and $80\\,\\mathrm{kg}$) for the same participant is not a contradiction; it is plausible that these measurements were taken at different times during the study, and the appropriate weight for each calculation is specified.

Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculation**\n\nThe standard operational definition of BMI is the weight of a person in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters.

Creatinine Clearance ($C_{Cr}$) Calculation**\n\nAs established during validation, the most appropriate formula for \"a widely used, well-tested clinical estimation for creatinine clearance applicable to adult males\" is the Cockcroft-Gault equation. For males, the formula is:\n$$\nC_{Cr}\\,(\\mathrm{mL/min}) = \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{weight (kg)}}{72 \\times \\text{serum creatinine (mg/dL)}}\n$$\nwhere age is in years.\n\nUsing the provided data for the participant:\n- Age = $62$ years\n- Weight = $80\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Serum creatinine = $1.1\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\nC_{Cr} = \\frac{(140 - 62) \\times 80}{72 \\times 1.1}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n(140 - 62) \\times 80 = 78 \\times 80 = 6240\n$$\n$$\n72 \\times 1.1 = 79.2\n$$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$\nC_{Cr} = \\frac{6240}{79.2} \\approx 78.7878...\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$\nC_{Cr} \\approx 78.79\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}\n$$\n\nThe two computed values, rounded to four significant figures as required, are $25.51$ for BMI and $78.79$ for creatinine clearance.

A total of $200$ subjects will be recruited across $10$ sites. Assume the following operational model is scientifically valid and holds exactly for this study.\n\n1. Enrollment begins at calendar day $0$ and proceeds uniformly at a constant total rate until $200$ subjects are enrolled by calendar day $200$. Thus, the aggregate enrollment rate is $200/200$ subjects per day.\n2. Each subject has $8$ protocol-defined visits scheduled over a fixed on-study follow-up horizon of $196$ days after that subject’s enrollment, and, to first approximation, visit times are uniformly distributed across this follow-up window.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to estimate the expected number of open queries at calendar day $t^*=60$. The problem specifies that this should be derived using the principle of flow conservation, which for a queuing system in steady-state is embodied by Little's Law. The \"local stationarity\" assumption allows us to apply this law using the instantaneous rates at $t^*=60$.\n\nLittle's Law states that the average number of items in a stationary system, $L$, is the product of the average arrival rate, $\\lambda$, and the average time an item spends in the system, $W$.\n$$L = \\lambda W$$\nIn our context:\n-   $L$ is the expected number of open queries, $E[Q(t^*)]$.\n-   $\\lambda$ is the total query arrival rate at time $t^*$, denoted $\\Lambda(t^*)$.\n-   $W$ is the mean query resolution time, $T_{res}$.\n\nThus, we must find $\\Lambda(t^*) = \\Lambda(60)$. The total query arrival rate is the product of the total visit rate at that time, $R_{visit}(t^*)$, and the mean number of queries per visit, $\\mu_q$.\n$$\\Lambda(t) = R_{visit}(t) \\cdot \\mu_q$$\n\nFirst, we derive the total visit rate, $R_{visit}(t)$, at a general calendar time $t$. A visit can occur at time $t$ only for subjects who have been enrolled and are within their follow-up period. A subject enrolled at time $\\tau$ has been on study for a duration $s = t - \\tau$. This subject contributes to the visit rate at time $t$ only if $s \\in [0, T_{follow}]$, which means $0 \\le t - \\tau \\le T_{follow}$, or $t - T_{follow} \\le \\tau \\le t$.\n\nThe total visit rate at time $t$ is the sum of contributions from all subjects enrolled over time. This is calculated by integrating the enrollment rate, $R_e(\\tau)$, multiplied by the per-subject visit intensity, $\\lambda_v$, over the relevant enrollment period.\nThe enrollment rate is $R_e = 1$ subject/day for $\\tau \\in [0, T_{enroll}]$, where $T_{enroll}=200$ days. The per-subject visit intensity is $\\lambda_v = \\frac{8}{196}$ visits/(subject $\\cdot$ day) for a subject whose time-on-study $s \\in [0, T_{follow}]$, where $T_{follow} = 196$ days.\n\nThe total visit rate is the convolution of the enrollment function and the per-subject visit function:\n$$R_{visit}(t) = \\int_0^t R_e(\\tau) \\cdot \\lambda_v(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau$$\nThe integrand is non-zero only if both conditions are met:\n1.  $0 \\le \\tau \\le T_{enroll}$\n2.  $0 \\le t-\\tau \\le T_{follow} \\implies t-T_{follow} \\le \\tau \\le t$\n\nCombining these, the integration is over $\\tau \\in [\\max(0, t-T_{follow}), \\min(t, T_{enroll})]$. Over this interval, the integrand is the constant value $R_e \\cdot \\lambda_v$.\n$$R_{visit}(t) = (R_e \\cdot \\lambda_v) \\left[ \\min(t, T_{enroll}) - \\max(0, t-T_{follow}) \\right]$$\n\nNow, we specialize this for the target time $t^* = 60$ days. The parameters are $R_e = 1$, $\\lambda_v = \\frac{8}{196}$, $T_{enroll} = 200$, and $T_{follow} = 196$.\nFor $t^*=60$:\n-   $\\min(t^*, T_{enroll}) = \\min(60, 200) = 60$.\n-   $\\max(0, t^*-T_{follow}) = \\max(0, 60-196) = \\max(0, -136) = 0$.\n\nThe duration over which enrolled subjects contribute to visits at $t^*=60$ is $60 - 0 = 60$ days.\nThe visit rate at $t^*=60$ is:\n$$R_{visit}(60) = \\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{8}{196}\\right) \\cdot (60 - 0) = \\frac{480}{196} \\text{ visits/day}$$\n\nNext, we find the total query arrival rate $\\Lambda(60)$ by multiplying the visit rate by the mean number of queries per visit, $\\mu_q = 3$.\n$$\\Lambda(60) = R_{visit}(60) \\cdot \\mu_q = \\frac{480}{196} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{1440}{196} \\text{ queries/day}$$\nSimplifying the fraction: $\\Lambda(60) = \\frac{360 \\times 4}{49 \\times 4} = \\frac{360}{49}$ queries/day.\n\nFinally, we apply Little's Law to estimate the expected number of open queries, $E[Q(60)]$, using the mean resolution time $T_{res} = 5$ days.\n$$E[Q(60)] = \\Lambda(60) \\cdot T_{res}$$\n$$E[Q(60)] = \\frac{1440}{196} \\cdot 5 = \\frac{7200}{196}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$E[Q(60)] = \\frac{1800 \\times 4}{49 \\times 4} = \\frac{1800}{49}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$E[Q(60)] = \\frac{1800}{49} \\approx 36.7346938...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.\n$$E[Q(60)] \\approx 36.73$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{36.73}$$", "id": "4998005"}]}
