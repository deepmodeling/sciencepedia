Three ascending dose levels $d_{1}  d_{2}  d_{3}$ were each tested in cohorts of size $n_{i} = 6$, yielding observed DLT counts $x_{1} = 1$, $x_{2} = 0$, and $x_{3} = 2$.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- At dose $d_{i}$, the DLT count $x_{i}$ follows a binomial model with probability $p(d_{i})$, that is $x_{i} \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n_{i}, p(d_{i}))$.\n- The non-decreasing order restriction $p(d_{1}) \\leq p(d_{2}) \\leq p(d_{3})$ embodies the monotonic dose-toxicity assumption.\n- The nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the ordered probabilities under this monotonicity constraint is obtained by the pooled adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA), which replaces any adjacent violations of the order constraint by pooling and weighting by cohort sizes.\n\nTake the target toxicity rate to be $\\theta = 0.25$.

Identify the MTD dose index.\n- **Formatting**: Round probabilities to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the statistical methods used for Phase I oncology trials. The binomial model for binary outcomes, the monotonicity assumption for dose-toxicity, and the use of isotonic regression (specifically PAVA) are standard and well-established practices in this field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated, providing all necessary data ($x_i, n_i$), parameters ($\\theta$), and a specific algorithm (PAVA) to compute the required quantities. The objective is unambiguous, leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise terminology from biostatistics and clinical trial design, devoid of any subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to first estimate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) probabilities for three dose levels, subject to a non-decreasing order constraint, and then to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) based on these estimates.\n\nThe initial, unconstrained maximum likelihood estimates of the DLT probabilities $p(d_i)$ are the empirical proportions of DLTs observed at each dose level. Let's denote these empirical rates as $p'_{i} = x_{i}/n_{i}$.\n\nFor dose level $d_1$:\n$$ p'_{1} = \\frac{x_{1}}{n_{1}} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\n\nFor dose level $d_2$:\n$$ p'_{2} = \\frac{x_{2}}{n_{2}} = \\frac{0}{6} = 0 $$\n\nFor dose level $d_3$:\n$$ p'_{3} = \\frac{x_{3}}{n_{3}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nThe sequence of these empirical rates is $(p'_{1}, p'_{2}, p'_{3}) = (\\frac{1}{6}, 0, \\frac{1}{3})$. The monotonicity assumption requires that the estimated probabilities be non-decreasing, i.e., $\\hat{p}(d_1) \\leq \\hat{p}(d_2) \\leq \\hat{p}(d_3)$. We check if the empirical rates satisfy this condition.\n\nComparing $p'_{1}$ and $p'_{2}$:\n$$ p'_{1} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p'_{2} = 0 $$\nSince $p'_{1} > p'_{2}$, the monotonicity constraint is violated.\n\nThe Pooled Adjacent Violators Algorithm (PAVA) is used to correct this violation and produce the isotonic estimates $\\hat{p}(d_i)$. PAVA identifies adjacent pairs that violate the order and replaces them with their weighted average until no violations remain. The weights are the cohort sizes $n_i$.\n\nThe violation occurs between dose levels $d_1$ and $d_2$. We must pool the data from these two levels and compute a single new estimate for this block. The pooled estimate is the total number of DLTs in the block divided by the total number of patients in the block.\n\nPooled estimate for the block $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$:\n$$ \\hat{p}_{\\{1,2\\}} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \\frac{1 + 0}{6 + 6} = \\frac{1}{12} $$\n\nThis pooled value replaces the individual estimates for $d_1$ and $d_2$. The working sequence of estimates becomes $(\\frac{1}{12}, \\frac{1}{12}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n\nWe now check this new sequence for monotonicity:\n$$ \\frac{1}{12} \\leq \\frac{1}{12} \\leq \\frac{1}{3} $$\nNumerically, this is approximately $0.0833 \\leq 0.0833 \\leq 0.3333$, which is true. Since there are no more violations, the algorithm terminates.\n\nThe final isotonic estimates for the DLT probabilities are:\n$$ \\hat{p}(d_1) = \\frac{1}{12} $$\n$$ \\hat{p}(d_2) = \\frac{1}{12} $$\n$$ \\hat{p}(d_3) = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding these probabilities to four significant figures.\n$$ \\hat{p}(d_1) = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.083333... \\rightarrow 0.08333 $$\n$$ \\hat{p}(d_2) = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.083333... \\rightarrow 0.08333 $$\n$$ \\hat{p}(d_3) = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333333... \\rightarrow 0.3333 $$\n\nNext, we identify the MTD. The MTD is defined as the highest dose $d_i$ for which the estimated DLT probability $\\hat{p}(d_i)$ is less than or equal to the target toxicity rate $\\theta = 0.25$.\n\nWe check this condition for each dose level:\n- For $d_1$: $\\hat{p}(d_1) = 0.08333$. Since $0.08333 \\leq 0.25$, dose $d_1$ is considered acceptable.\n- For $d_2$: $\\hat{p}(d_2) = 0.08333$. Since $0.08333 \\leq 0.25$, dose $d_2$ is also considered acceptable.\n- For $d_3$: $\\hat{p}(d_3) = 0.3333$. Since $0.3333 > 0.25$, dose $d_3$ is considered unacceptably toxic.\n\nThe set of acceptable doses is $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$. The MTD is the highest dose in this set, which is $d_2$. The problem asks for the MTD dose index, which is $2$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the three estimated probabilities and the MTD index.\nThe values are $\\hat{p}(d_1) = 0.08333$, $\\hat{p}(d_2) = 0.08333$, $\\hat{p}(d_3) = 0.3333$, and the MTD index is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.08333  0.08333  0.3333  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5029471"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple adjustments, modern dose-finding relies on robust statistical models to guide decisions.

The criterion for optimality is to select the dose $d$ for which the posterior mean dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) probability, $\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(d,a,r) | \\mathrm{data}]$, is closest to the target DLT probability $p^{\\ast} = 0.25$.\n\nThe DLT probability for a patient with age $a$ and estimated glomerular filtration rate $r$ receiving dose $d$ is given by the probit model:\n$$\n\\pi(d,a,r) = \\Phi(\\eta(d,a,r))\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), and the linear predictor $\\eta(d,a,r)$ is\n$$\n\\eta(d,a,r) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\,\\ln(d/40) + \\gamma_{a}\\,\\frac{a-60}{10} + \\gamma_{k}\\,\\frac{60-r}{15}\n$$\nThe parameter vector $\\theta = (\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, \\gamma_{a}, \\gamma_{k})^{\\top}$ is treated as a random variable. Its posterior distribution, given the data from previously treated patients, is approximated by a multivariate normal distribution $\\theta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)$, with mean vector $\\mu$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ given as:\n$$\n\\mu = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.85 \\\\ 0.60 \\\\ 0.20 \\\\ 0.40 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\Sigma = \\mathrm{diag}(0.09, 0.04, 0.0225, 0.0225)\n$$\nFor a new patient, the covariates $a$ and $r$, and the dose $d$ are fixed. The linear predictor $\\eta(d,a,r)$ can be written as a linear transformation of the parameter vector $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\eta(d,a,r) = X(d,a,r)^{\\top}\\theta\n$$\nwhere $X(d,a,r)$ is a vector of covariates:\n$$\nX(d,a,r) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\ln(d/40) \\\\ \\frac{a-60}{10} \\\\ \\frac{60-r}{15} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\theta$ is normally distributed, the linear predictor $\\eta(d,a,r)$ is also normally distributed. Its posterior distribution is $\\eta(d,a,r) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\eta}, \\sigma_{\\eta}^2)$, with mean and variance given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\eta}(d,a,r) = \\mathbb{E}[X(d,a,r)^{\\top}\\theta] = X(d,a,r)^{\\top}\\mu\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(d,a,r) = \\mathrm{Var}(X(d,a,r)^{\\top}\\theta) = X(d,a,r)^{\\top}\\Sigma X(d,a,r)\n$$\nThe task is to compute the posterior mean DLT probability, which is the expectation of $\\Phi(\\eta(d,a,r))$ over the posterior distribution of $\\eta(d,a,r)$. Let $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_Z, \\sigma_Z^2)$. We need to calculate $\\mathbb{E}[\\Phi(Z)]$. This expectation can be found by introducing an independent standard normal variable $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Phi(Z)] = \\mathbb{E}[P(Y \\le Z | Z)] = P(Y \\le Z) = P(Y - Z \\le 0)\n$$\nThe variable $W = Y - Z$ is a linear combination of independent normal variables, so it is also normal. Its mean is $\\mathbb{E}[W] = \\mathbb{E}[Y] - \\mathbb{E}[Z] = 0 - \\mu_Z = -\\mu_Z$. Its variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(W) = \\mathrm{Var}(Y) + \\mathrm{Var}(-Z) = \\mathrm{Var}(Y) + \\mathrm{Var}(Z) = 1 + \\sigma_Z^2$. Thus, $W \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-\\mu_Z, 1 + \\sigma_Z^2)$. The desired probability is:\n$$\nP(W \\le 0) = P\\left(\\frac{W - (-\\mu_Z)}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma_Z^2}} \\le \\frac{0 - (-\\mu_Z)}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma_Z^2}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_Z}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma_Z^2}}\\right)\n$$\nApplying this result, the posterior mean DLT probability is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(d,a,r) | \\mathrm{data}] = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\eta}(d,a,r)}{\\sqrt{1+\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(d,a,r)}}\\right)\n$$\nFor the new patient, $a = 68$ and $r = 45$. The patient-specific covariate terms are:\n$$\n\\frac{a-60}{10} = \\frac{68-60}{10} = 0.8 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{60-r}{15} = \\frac{60-45}{15} = 1\n$$\nWe compute $\\mu_{\\eta}$ and $\\sigma_{\\eta}^2$ for this patient as a function of dose $d$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\eta}(d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\ln(d/40)  0.8  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.85 \\\\ 0.60 \\\\ 0.20 \\\\ 0.40 \\end{pmatrix} = -0.85 + 0.60\\ln(d/40) + 0.20(0.8) + 0.40(1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\eta}(d) = -0.85 + 0.16 + 0.40 + 0.60\\ln(d/40) = -0.29 + 0.60\\ln(d/40)\n$$\nSince $\\Sigma$ is diagonal, the variance calculation simplifies:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(d) = (1)^2\\sigma_{\\beta_0}^2 + (\\ln(d/40))^2\\sigma_{\\beta_1}^2 + (0.8)^2\\sigma_{\\gamma_a}^2 + (1)^2\\sigma_{\\gamma_k}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(d) = 0.09 + 0.04(\\ln(d/40))^2 + (0.64)(0.0225) + (1)(0.0225)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(d) = 0.09 + 0.0144 + 0.0225 + 0.04(\\ln(d/40))^2 = 0.1269 + 0.04(\\ln(d/40))^2\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the posterior mean DLT probability for each dose $d \\in \\mathcal{D}$ and find its absolute difference from $p^{\\ast} = 0.25$.\n\nFor $d=20$:\n$\\ln(20/40) = -\\ln(2) \\approx -0.6931$\n$\\mu_{\\eta}(20) = -0.29 + 0.60(-\\ln(2)) \\approx -0.7059$\n$\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(20) = 0.1269 + 0.04(-\\ln(2))^2 \\approx 0.1461$\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(20)] = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-0.7059}{\\sqrt{1+0.1461}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-0.7059}{1.0706}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(-0.6594) \\approx 0.2548$\n$|\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(20)] - 0.25| = |0.2548 - 0.25| = 0.0048$\n\nFor $d=30$:\n$\\ln(30/40) = \\ln(0.75) \\approx -0.2877$\n$\\mu_{\\eta}(30) = -0.29 + 0.60(\\ln(0.75)) \\approx -0.4626$\n$\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(30) = 0.1269 + 0.04(\\ln(0.75))^2 \\approx 0.1302$\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(30)] = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-0.4626}{\\sqrt{1+0.1302}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-0.4626}{1.0631}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(-0.4351) \\approx 0.3318$\n$|\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(30)] - 0.25| = |0.3318 - 0.25| = 0.0818$\n\nFor $d=40$:\n$\\ln(40/40) = \\ln(1) = 0$\n$\\mu_{\\eta}(40) = -0.29$\n$\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(40) = 0.1269$\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(40)] = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-0.29}{\\sqrt{1+0.1269}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-0.29}{1.0616}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(-0.2732) \\approx 0.3924$\n$|\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(40)] - 0.25| = |0.3924 - 0.25| = 0.1424$\n\nFor $d=60$:\n$\\ln(60/40) = \\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.4055$\n$\\mu_{\\eta}(60) = -0.29 + 0.60(\\ln(1.5)) \\approx -0.0467$\n$\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(60) = 0.1269 + 0.04(\\ln(1.5))^2 \\approx 0.1335$\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(60)] = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-0.0467}{\\sqrt{1+0.1335}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-0.0467}{1.0646}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(-0.0439) \\approx 0.4825$\n$|\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(60)] - 0.25| = |0.4825 - 0.25| = 0.2325$\n\nFor $d=80$:\n$\\ln(80/40) = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$\n$\\mu_{\\eta}(80) = -0.29 + 0.60(\\ln(2)) \\approx 0.1259$\n$\\sigma_{\\eta}^2(80) = 0.1269 + 0.04(\\ln(2))^2 \\approx 0.1461$\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(80)] = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0.1259}{\\sqrt{1+0.1461}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0.1259}{1.0706}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(0.1176) \\approx 0.5468$\n$|\\mathbb{E}[\\pi(80)] - 0.25| = |0.5468 - 0.25| = 0.2968$\n\nComparing the absolute differences:\n- Dose $20$ mg: $0.0048$\n- Dose $30$ mg: $0.0818$\n- Dose $40$ mg: $0.1424$\n- Dose $60$ mg: $0.2325$\n- Dose $80$ mg: $0.2968$\n\nThe minimum absolute difference is $0.0048$, which corresponds to the dose of $20$ mg.
