Allocation concealment is compromised because recruiters use open envelopes that reveal the block size and allow inference from previously assigned allocations within the current block. Assume the following scientifically plausible framework: blocks are generated uniformly at random from all balanced permutations, the recruiter knows the block size $m$, the fixed per-block quotas, and observes the allocations already assigned in the current block, but cannot see into future envelopes. At each enrollment within a block, indexed by position $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, the recruiter attempts to predict the next allocation once. The recruiter uses an optimal strategy: choose the arm with the larger remaining per-block quota; if the remaining quotas are equal, the recruiter guesses randomly between arms $A$ and $B$. Assume the position $k$ at which the recruiter makes the prediction is uniformly distributed over $\\{1,\\ldots,6\\}$.\n\nStarting only from the definition of permuted-block randomization, the concept of sampling without replacement, and basic combinatorics, derive the expected probability that the recruiter correctly predicts the next allocation, averaged over the random position $k$ and the random balanced block sequence. Express the final probability as a single exact fraction. No units are required, and rounding is not permitted.\n\nThen, briefly justify two scientifically grounded mitigation strategies within translational medicine practice that would reduce this predictability: one addressing allocation concealment (for example, sealed sequentially numbered opaque envelopes) and one addressing the randomization structure (for example, randomly varying block sizes unknown to recruiters).

The flaw in the problem is that the recruiter can observe past allocations within the block. A proper concealment mechanism ensures that the recruiter is blind to all previous assignments. By opening envelopes in strict sequence (enforced by numbering) or by receiving the allocation from a remote system, the recruiter gains no information about the block's composition or their position within it. This intervention directly breaks the feedback loop that enables prediction. The recruiter's forecast for any given subject would revert to a random guess between arm $A$ and arm $B$, reducing the probability of a correct prediction to the ideal value of $\\frac{1}{2}$, assuming no other biases are present.\n\nSecond, to address the predictability inherent in the randomization structure itself, one can use randomly varying block sizes. The recruiter's ability to predict future allocations, especially towards the end of a block, relies on knowing the fixed block size ($m=6$) and the fixed allocation ratio ($3$:$3$). By using a mix of different block sizes (e.g., blocks of size $2$, $4$, and $6$) chosen randomly for each successive block, the recruiter can no longer be certain when a block is nearing its end. For example, after observing allocations $A, A, B$, the recruiter does not know if the next allocation must be $B$ (to complete a block of size $4$ with a $2$:$2$ ratio) or if they are in the middle of a larger block where the next allocation is not as constrained. This uncertainty about the block's boundary obfuscates the \"card-counting\" process, reducing the forcing of allocations and thus decreasing the predictability below the calculated $\\frac{41}{60}$. The block sizes must remain unknown to the site personnel for this method to be effective.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{41}{60}}\n$$", "id": "5053984"}, {"introduction": "After randomizing a participant, maintaining the blind is paramount to prevent bias in outcome reporting and assessment.

No numerical rounding is required and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard biostatistical problem concerning the impact of covariate adjustment on the precision of treatment effect estimation in a randomized controlled trial. All necessary parameters, models, and definitions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is valid.\n\nWe will address the three parts of the problem in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Analysis of biomarker differences $D_Z$ and $D_Z^{(z)}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the expectation of the overall standardized difference in the biomarker, $D_Z = \\frac{\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}$. The sample means $\\bar{Z}_T$ and $\\bar{Z}_C$ are the averages of the biomarker $Z_i$ over the $n_T = n/2$ subjects in the treatment arm and $n_C = n/2$ subjects in the control arm, respectively.\nBy the assumption of complete randomization, treatment assignment $A_i$ is independent of the biomarker status $Z_i$. The variables $Z_i$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) as $\\operatorname{Bernoulli}(p)$. Therefore, the expected value of $Z_i$ for any subject, regardless of treatment assignment, is $\\mathbb{E}[Z_i] = p$.\nUsing the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{Z}_T] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{n_T} \\sum_{i: A_i=1} Z_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{n_T} \\sum_{i: A_i=1} \\mathbb{E}[Z_i] = \\frac{1}{n_T} (n_T p) = p.\n$$\nSimilarly, $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{Z}_C] = p$.\nThe expectation of $D_Z$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[D_Z] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{Z}_T] - \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{Z}_C]}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}} = \\frac{p-p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}} = 0.\n$$\n\nNext, we compute $\\mathbb{E}[D_Z^2]$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[D_Z] = 0$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[D_Z^2] = \\operatorname{Var}(D_Z)$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(D_Z) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{p(1-p)} \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C).\n$$\nThe subjects in the treatment and control arms are distinct, and the $Z_i$ values are i.i.d. Therefore, $\\bar{Z}_T$ and $\\bar{Z}_C$ are independent, and $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\bar{Z}_T, \\bar{Z}_C) = 0$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_T) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_C).\n$$\nThe variance of a single $Z_i \\sim \\operatorname{Bernoulli}(p)$ is $\\operatorname{Var}(Z_i) = p(1-p)$. The variance of the sample mean of $n_T$ such i.i.d. variables is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_T) = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(Z_i)}{n_T} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n_T}.\n$$\nSimilarly, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_C) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n_C}$.\nWith equal allocation $n_T = n_C = n/2$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n/2} + \\frac{p(1-p)}{n/2} = \\frac{2p(1-p)}{n} + \\frac{2p(1-p)}{n} = \\frac{4p(1-p)}{n}.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[D_Z^2]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[D_Z^2] = \\frac{1}{p(1-p)} \\left(\\frac{4p(1-p)}{n}\\right) = \\frac{4}{n}.\n$$\nThis is the first-order result in $1/n$.\n\nFinally, we compute the within-stratum standardized difference $D_Z^{(z)}$ for $z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe term $\\bar{Z}_{T \\mid Z=z}$ is the sample mean of the biomarker $Z$ among participants in the treatment group who have $Z=z$. By definition, for every such participant $i$, $Z_i=z$. Therefore, the sample mean must be $z$:\n$$\n\\bar{Z}_{T \\mid Z=z} = z.\n$$\nThis holds as long as the stratum is not empty in the treatment arm. Similarly, for the control arm:\n$$\n\\bar{Z}_{C \\mid Z=z} = z.\n$$\nThus, for both strata:\n$$\nD_Z^{(z)} = \\frac{z - z}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}} = 0.\n$$\nSo, $D_Z^{(0)} = 0$ and $D_Z^{(1)} = 0$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of estimator variances.\n\nFirst, we derive $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{unadj}})$, where $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{unadj}} = \\bar{Y}_T - \\bar{Y}_C$. The sample means of the outcome are:\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_T = \\frac{1}{n_T}\\sum_{i: A_i=1} Y_i = \\frac{1}{n_T}\\sum_{i: A_i=1} (\\tau \\cdot 1 + \\beta Z_i + \\varepsilon_i) = \\tau + \\beta \\bar{Z}_T + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_T.\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_C = \\frac{1}{n_C}\\sum_{i: A_i=0} Y_i = \\frac{1}{n_C}\\sum_{i: A_i=0} (\\tau \\cdot 0 + \\beta Z_i + \\varepsilon_i) = \\beta \\bar{Z}_C + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C.\n$$\nThe unadjusted estimator can be written as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{unadj}} = (\\tau + \\beta \\bar{Z}_T + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_T) - (\\beta \\bar{Z}_C + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C) = \\tau + \\beta(\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C) + (\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C).\n$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C]=0$, the estimator is unbiased, $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{unadj}}] = \\tau$. Its variance is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{unadj}}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\beta(\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C) + (\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C)).\n$$\nThe variables $Z_i$ and $\\varepsilon_j$ are independent for all $i, j$. Therefore, the term $(\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C)$ is independent of $(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C)$, and their variances add:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{unadj}}) = \\beta^2 \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C).\n$$\nWe already found $\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Z}_T - \\bar{Z}_C) = \\frac{4p(1-p)}{n}$.\nThe variance of the error term difference is $\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_C)$. Since $\\varepsilon_i$ are i.i.d. with variance $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_T} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n/2} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}.\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_C) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_C} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n/2} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}.\n$$\nSo, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_T - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_C) = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{n}$.\nCombining the terms, the variance of the unadjusted estimator is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{unadj}}) = \\beta^2 \\left(\\frac{4p(1-p)}{n}\\right) + \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2 + 4\\beta^2 p(1-p)}{n}.\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{4\\beta^2 p(1-p)}{n}$ is the contribution from the chance imbalance in the prognostic biomarker $Z$ between the treatment and control arms.\n\nNext, we derive $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}})$. The estimator is $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}} = p \\hat{\\tau}_1 + (1-p) \\hat{\\tau}_0$, where $\\hat{\\tau}_z = \\bar{Y}_{T \\mid Z=z} - \\bar{Y}_{C \\mid Z=z}$.\nWithin stratum $Z=z$, the outcome model for a subject $i$ is $Y_i = \\tau A_i + \\beta z + \\varepsilon_i$.\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{T \\mid Z=z} = \\frac{1}{n_{T,z}}\\sum_{i:A_i=1,Z_i=z}(\\tau + \\beta z + \\varepsilon_i) = \\tau + \\beta z + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{T,z}.\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{C \\mid Z=z} = \\frac{1}{n_{C,z}}\\sum_{i:A_i=0,Z_i=z}(\\beta z + \\varepsilon_i) = \\beta z + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{C,z}.\n$$\nThe within-stratum difference is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_z = (\\tau + \\beta z + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{T,z}) - (\\beta z + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{C,z}) = \\tau + (\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{T,z} - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{C,z}).\n$$\nThe post-stratified estimator becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}} = p(\\tau + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{T,1} - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{C,1}) + (1-p)(\\tau + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{T,0} - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{C,0}) = \\tau + p(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{T,1} - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{C,1}) + (1-p)(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{T,0} - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{C,0}).\n$$\nThe terms involving $\\beta$ and $Z$ have been removed by the stratification process. This explains why the extra variance term due to $Z$ imbalance vanishes for $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}}$.\nThe estimators $\\hat{\\tau}_1$ and $\\hat{\\tau}_0$ are computed on disjoint subsets of the data (subjects with $Z=1$ vs $Z=0$) and are therefore independent.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}}) = p^2 \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_1) + (1-p)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_0).\n$$\nWe need $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_z) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{T,z} - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{C,z})$. The stratum sample sizes $n_{T,z}$ and $n_{C,z}$ are random. We use the law of total variance, conditioning on these sizes.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_z) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_z | n_{T,z}, n_{C,z})] + \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\tau}_z | n_{T,z}, n_{C,z}]).\n$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\tau}_z | n_{T,z}, n_{C,z}] = \\tau$, the second term is $\\operatorname{Var}(\\tau)=0$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_z) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n_{T,z}} + \\frac{1}{n_{C,z}}\\right)\\right] = \\sigma^2 \\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{n_{T,z}}\\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{n_{C,z}}\\right]\\right).\n$$\nTo first order in $1/n$, we use the approximation $\\mathbb{E}[1/X] \\approx 1/\\mathbb{E}[X]$.\nThe expected sample sizes are $\\mathbb{E}[n_{T,1}] = n_T \\Pr(Z=1) = (n/2)p$, and $\\mathbb{E}[n_{C,1}] = n_C \\Pr(Z=1) = (n/2)p$.\nThus, for stratum $z=1$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{n_{T,1}}\\right] \\approx \\frac{1}{np/2} = \\frac{2}{np}, \\quad \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{n_{C,1}}\\right] \\approx \\frac{1}{np/2} = \\frac{2}{np}.\n$$\nSo, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_1) \\approx \\sigma^2(\\frac{2}{np} + \\frac{2}{np}) = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{np}$.\nSimilarly, for stratum $z=0$, we replace $p$ with $(1-p)$: $\\mathbb{E}[n_{T,0}] = n(1-p)/2$ and $\\mathbb{E}[n_{C,0}] = n(1-p)/2$.\nSo, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_0) \\approx \\sigma^2(\\frac{2}{n(1-p)} + \\frac{2}{n(1-p)}) = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{n(1-p)}$.\nSubstituting these into the variance expression for $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}}) \\approx p^2\\left(\\frac{4\\sigma^2}{np}\\right) + (1-p)^2\\left(\\frac{4\\sigma^2}{n(1-p)}\\right) = \\frac{4p\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{4(1-p)\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{n}(p + 1 - p) = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{n}.\n$$\nAs derived, the component of variance related to $\\beta$ is absent in $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}})$.\n\nPart 3: Variance ratio $R(p,\\beta,\\sigma^2)$.\n\nWe compute the ratio of the two variances to the first order in $1/n$:\n$$\nR(p,\\beta,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{unadj}})}{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{post}})} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\sigma^2 + 4\\beta^2 p(1-p)}{n}}{\\frac{4\\sigma^2}{n}}.\n$$\n$$\nR(p,\\beta,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{4\\sigma^2 + 4\\beta^2 p(1-p)}{4\\sigma^2} = 1 + \\frac{4\\beta^2 p(1-p)}{4\\sigma^2}.\n$$\n$$\nR(p,\\beta,\\sigma^2) = 1 + \\frac{\\beta^2 p(1-p)}{\\sigma^2}.\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the variance ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 + \\frac{\\beta^2 p(1-p)}{\\sigma^2}}\n$$", "id": "5054035"}]}
