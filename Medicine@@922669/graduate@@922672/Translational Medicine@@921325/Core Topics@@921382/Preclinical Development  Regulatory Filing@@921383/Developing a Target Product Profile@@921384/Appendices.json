The process involves interspecies dose scaling using an allometric relationship and the application of a safety factor. The solution will proceed by first deriving the general formula for scaling a dose per unit body mass between species, and then applying this formula with the given parameters to compute the final absolute dose.\n\nThe fundamental principle for interspecies scaling is to achieve equivalent systemic exposure of the drug, which is often quantified by the Area Under the plasma concentration-time Curve (AUC). The AUC is determined by the total dose administered and the drug's clearance (CL) from the body:\n$$\n\\text{AUC} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{total}}}{\\text{CL}}\n$$\nTo achieve equivalent exposure in the human as observed at the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) dose in the animal model (dog), we set their AUCs to be equal:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\text{human}} = \\text{AUC}_{\\text{dog}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{total, human}}}{\\text{CL}_{\\text{human}}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{total, dog}}}{\\text{CL}_{\\text{dog}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that physiological processes like clearance scale allometrically with body mass ($W$) according to the relationship $Y \\propto W^{b}$, with the exponent given as $b = 0.75$.

The effect of a therapy relative to a comparator is given by the natural logarithm of the hazard ratio, $\\ln(HR)$. A more effective therapy has a lower hazard rate, so its $HR$ is less than $1$ and its $\\ln(HR)$ is negative.

A higher HR indicates lower efficacy. The least favorable plausible value for $HR_{S:P}$ is therefore the upper bound of its $95\\%$ confidence interval.

The benefit of the SoC, based on the conservative assumption, is $B_S = -\\ln(HR_{S:P, \\text{upper}})$.
