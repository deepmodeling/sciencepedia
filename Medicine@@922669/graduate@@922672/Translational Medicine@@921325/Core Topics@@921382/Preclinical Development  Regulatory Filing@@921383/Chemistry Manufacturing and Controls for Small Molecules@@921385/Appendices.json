Dynamic similarity is defined in the problem as maintaining an equal Reynolds number ($Re$). For an agitated tank with impeller diameter $D$ and agitation speed $N$, the impeller Reynolds number is defined as:\n$$Re = \\frac{\\rho N D^2}{\\mu}$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. For the Reynolds number to be dimensionless, the agitation speed $N$ must be in units of revolutions per unit time, such as $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe condition for scale-up is $Re_1 = Re_2$.\n$$\\frac{\\rho_1 N_1 D_1^2}{\\mu_1} = \\frac{\\rho_2 N_2 D_2^2}{\\mu_2}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown pilot-scale agitation speed, $N_2$.\n$$N_2 = N_1 \\left( \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_2}{\\mu_1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{D_1}{D_2} \\right)^2$$\nSince $N_1$ and $N_2$ appear as a ratio, we can perform the calculation using $N_1$ in revolutions per minute ($\\mathrm{rpm}$), and the resulting $N_2$ will also be in $\\mathrm{rpm}$.

The power input, $P$, to an agitated vessel is related to the fluid properties and operating conditions through the dimensionless Power number, $N_p$:\n$$N_p = \\frac{P}{\\rho N^3 D^5}$$\nFor baffled tanks operating in the turbulent flow regime (typically $Re > 10^4$), the Power number is approximately constant for a given geometry.

The dissolution of a solid drug from a dosage form into a liquid medium is governed by kinetic laws, the simplest of which is described by the Noyes–Whitney equation or its refinements. In a conceptual framework, the rate of dissolution, $\\frac{dM}{dt}$, where $M$ is the mass dissolved at time $t$, is proportional to the available surface area of the drug, $A$, and the concentration gradient across a stagnant boundary layer:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = k A (C_s - C_b(t)) $$\nHere, $k$ is the mass transfer coefficient, $C_s$ is the saturation solubility of the drug in the medium, and $C_b(t)$ is the concentration of the drug in the bulk medium at time $t$. The concentration is related to the mass dissolved by $C_b(t) = M(t)/V$, where $V$ is the volume of the dissolution medium ($900$ mL in this case).\n\nA manufacturing change, such as switching a lubricant supplier, can alter the physicochemical properties of the formulation. A change in the lubricant's particle size distribution can affect the hydrophobicity of the tablet matrix, tablet disintegration time, and the deaggregation of drug particles. These changes directly influence the effective surface area, $A$, available for dissolution as a function of time. Consequently, the dissolution profile, typically reported as the percentage of drug dissolved over time, serves as a sensitive and scientifically relevant in vitro surrogate for assessing the potential in vivo impact of such manufacturing changes.\n\nTo quantify the difference between a reference profile, $R_t$, and a test profile, $T_t$, a similarity metric is necessary. Such a metric must distill the differences across multiple sampling times into a single, interpretable value.\n\nWe will now derive a metric, which we denote as $f$, that satisfies the four specific criteria given in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Metric based on squared deviations:** A robust method for quantifying the total difference between two profiles is to sum the squared differences at each common time point, $t_i$. To make this measure an average, we divide by the number of time points, $n$. This gives the Mean Squared Difference (MSD), which we denote as $M$:\n    $$ M = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (R_{t_i} - T_{t_i})^2 $$\n    The problem asks for a metric based on the root-mean-square difference (RMSD), where $\\text{RMSD} = \\sqrt{M}$. Since $M = (\\text{RMSD})^2$, a metric based on $M$ is functionally based on the RMSD. Using $M$ is mathematically more convenient.\n\n2.  **Logarithmic compression and monotonic decrease:** The problem requires a base-$10$ logarithmic transform to compress the dynamic range and that the metric, $f$, must decrease as the squared deviations (and thus $M$) grow. A suitable functional form that satisfies these properties is:\n    $$ f(M) = C_1 - C_2 \\log_{10}(1 + M) $$\n    where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are positive constants. The addition of $1$ inside the logarithm ensures that the argument is always greater than or equal to $1$ (since $M \\ge 0$), making the logarithm non-negative and well-defined. As $M$ increases, $\\log_{10}(1+M)$ increases, causing $f(M)$ to decrease, satisfying the monotonicity requirement.\n\n3.  **Mapping identical profiles to $100$:** If the profiles are identical, $R_{t_i} = T_{t_i}$ for all $i$, which means the difference is $0$ at all points. In this case, $M=0$. The metric should evaluate to $100$.\n    $$ f(0) = C_1 - C_2 \\log_{10}(1 + 0) = C_1 - C_2 \\log_{10}(1) = C_1 - 0 = C_1 $$\n    Therefore, we must have $C_1 = 100$. The metric now has the form:\n    $$ f(M) = 100 - C_2 \\log_{10}(1 + M) $$\n\n4.  **Consistency with regulatory conventions:** The final constant, $C_2$, is determined by regulatory convention. The standard for similarity (e.g., used by the FDA and EMA) sets a threshold value for the metric. A value of $50$ is conventionally considered the lower limit for concluding similarity. This threshold is associated with a maximum tolerated average difference between profiles. The convention holds that an average absolute difference of $10$ percentage points at each time point is the largest difference for which two profiles can still be considered similar.\n    Let's apply this condition: if $|R_{t_i} - T_{t_i}| = 10$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$, then $M$ becomes:\n    $$ M = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (10)^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 100 = \\frac{1}{n} (n \\times 100) = 100 $$\n    We set $f(100) = 50$ to solve for $C_2$:\n    $$ 50 = 100 - C_2 \\log_{10}(1 + 100) $$\n    $$ 50 = C_2 \\log_{10}(101) $$\n    $$ C_2 = \\frac{50}{\\log_{10}(101)} $$\n    For practical and historical reasons in regulatory science, $\\log_{10}(101)$ is approximated as $\\log_{10}(100) = 2$. This simplification leads to:\n    $$ C_2 \\approx \\frac{50}{2} = 25 $$\n    Substituting the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ into our derived form gives the final expression for the similarity metric, commonly known as the $f_2$ factor:\n    $$ f_2 = 100 - 25 \\log_{10} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (R_{t_i} - T_{t_i})^2 \\right) $$\nThis expression fulfills all the requirements laid out in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Similarity Metric**\n\nWe now use the derived formula to compute the similarity value for the provided data.\nThe given data are:\n- Number of time points, $n = 6$.\n- Time points, $t$: $\\{5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45\\}$ minutes.\n- Reference profile, $R_t$: $\\{20, 40, 60, 75, 88, 95\\}$.\n- Test profile, $T_t$: $\\{15, 35, 55, 70, 83, 90\\}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the squared differences, $(R_{t_i} - T_{t_i})^2$, at each time point.\n- At $t=5$ min: $(20 - 15)^2 = 5^2 = 25$.\n- At $t=10$ min: $(40 - 35)^2 = 5^2 = 25$.\n- At $t=15$ min: $(60 - 55)^2 = 5^2 = 25$.\n- At $t=20$ min: $(75 - 70)^2 = 5^2 = 25$.\n- At $t=30$ min: $(88 - 83)^2 = 5^2 = 25$.\n- At $t=45$ min: $(95 - 90)^2 = 5^2 = 25$.\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of these squared differences:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (R_{t_i} - T_{t_i})^2 = 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 6 \\times 25 = 150 $$\n\nNow, we calculate the Mean Squared Difference, $M$:\n$$ M = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (R_{t_i} - T_{t_i})^2 = \\frac{150}{6} = 25 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this value of $M$ into the similarity metric formula:\n$$ f_2 = 100 - 25 \\log_{10}(1 + M) $$\n$$ f_2 = 100 - 25 \\log_{10}(1 + 25) $$\n$$ f_2 = 100 - 25 \\log_{10}(26) $$\n\nUsing a calculator for the value of the logarithm:\n$$ \\log_{10}(26) \\approx 1.414973348 $$\n$$ f_2 \\approx 100 - 25 \\times 1.414973348 $$\n$$ f_2 \\approx 100 - 35.3743337 $$\n$$ f_2 \\approx 64.6256663 $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$ f_2 \\approx 64.63 $$\nThe resulting value is a dimensionless number.
