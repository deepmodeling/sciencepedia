The provided information is sufficient and consistent for deriving the requested quantities. The problem will be solved in two parts as requested.\n\nThe fundamental assumptions are first-order elimination kinetics and dose superposition. First-order elimination implies that the rate of drug elimination is proportional to the drug concentration $C$, described by the differential equation $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$, where $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.

We will derive this using the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) over one dosing interval, $\\tau$.\n\nLet us assume, without loss of generality, that each dose is administered as an intravenous bolus, resulting in an initial concentration increase of $C_0$. After a single dose, the concentration at time $t$ is $C_1(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$. The AUC over the first dosing interval, from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$, is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-\\tau, \\text{single dose}} = \\int_0^\\tau C_1(t) dt = \\int_0^\\tau C_0 \\exp(-kt) dt = C_0 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-kt) \\right]_0^\\tau = \\frac{C_0}{k} (1 - \\exp(-k\\tau))\n$$\nAt steady state ($ss$), the concentration profile is periodic. The principle of superposition states that the concentration at steady state is the sum of concentrations remaining from an infinite series of previous doses. The concentration just before a dose at steady state (trough concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{min},ss}$) is the sum of the residual concentrations from all prior doses:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{min},ss} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_0 \\exp(-nk\\tau)\n$$\nThis is a geometric series with first term $a = C_0 \\exp(-k\\tau)$ and common ratio $r = \\exp(-k\\tau)$.

We analyze the accumulation of drug concentration at a specific point in the dosing interval, for instance, the peak concentration immediately after dosing. The peak concentration after the $n$-th dose, $C_{\\mathrm{max},n}$, is the sum of concentrations from the current dose and all previous doses:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{max},n} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_0 \\exp(-ik\\tau) = C_0 \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\exp(-k\\tau))^i\n$$\nThis is a finite geometric series with $n$ terms, first term $a=C_0$, and ratio $r=\\exp(-k\\tau)$. The sum is $S_n = a \\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{max},n} = C_0 \\frac{1 - \\exp(-nk\\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}\n$$\nWe know that $C_{\\mathrm{max},ss} = \\frac{C_0}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}$. Therefore, we can write $C_{\\mathrm{max},n}$ in terms of $C_{\\mathrm{max},ss}$:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{max},n} = C_{\\mathrm{max},ss} (1 - \\exp(-nk\\tau))\n$$\nThe fraction of the steady-state level achieved after the $n$-th dose is $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{max},n}}{C_{\\mathrm{max},ss}} = 1 - \\exp(-nk\\tau)$.\nThe problem defines $t_f$ as the time at which this fraction is $f$. The time of the $n$-th dose is $t_n = (n-1)\\tau$. While the concentration evolves in discrete steps, the envelope of accumulation follows a continuous first-order process. The time course of accumulation towards steady state is governed by the term $1 - \\exp(-kt)$. We can therefore set $t_f$ as the time in this continuous model where the fraction $f$ of the final value is reached.\n$$\nf = 1 - \\exp(-kt_f)\n$$\nThis approach is valid because the time constant for accumulation is determined solely by the elimination rate constant $k$, not by the dosing interval $\\tau$.
