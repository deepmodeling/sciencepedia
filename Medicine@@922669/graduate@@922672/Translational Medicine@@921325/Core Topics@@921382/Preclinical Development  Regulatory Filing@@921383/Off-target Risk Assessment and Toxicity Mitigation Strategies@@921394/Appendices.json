In translational medicine, off-target occupancy is used to set exposure limits to mitigate toxicity risk. Consider the reversible binding reaction between free drug and the off-target binding site, where the drug concentration is much larger than the binding site concentration so that drug depletion by binding is negligible. Assume thermodynamic equilibrium and apply the law of mass action to derive an expression for the equilibrium fraction of off-target sites occupied by the drug (the occupancy) as a function of the free drug concentration and the dissociation constant. Then link this relationship to a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model under constant-rate intravenous infusion at steady state to compute an exposure threshold.\n\nStarting assumptions and definitions:\n- The reversible binding reaction is $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$, where $R$ is the unbound off-target binding site, $L$ is the free drug, and $RL$ is the bound complex. The equilibrium dissociation constant is defined by $K_d \\equiv \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$.\n- The total off-target binding site concentration is $R_T \\equiv [R] + [RL]$.\n- Occupancy is defined as the fraction of sites occupied by drug, $\\mathrm{Occ} \\equiv \\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$.\n- At steady state during constant-rate intravenous infusion with rate $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, in a one-compartment model with linear clearance $CL$, the total plasma concentration equals $C_{\\mathrm{tot,ss}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in}}}{CL}$.\n- The free fraction of drug in plasma is $f_u$ (dimensionless), so the steady-state free concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{free,ss}} = f_u \\, C_{\\mathrm{tot,ss}}$.\n- A predefined safety limit on off-target occupancy is a decimal fraction $S$, such that toxicity mitigation requires $\\mathrm{Occ} \\leq S$ at steady state.\n\nTasks:\n1.

It is based on standard principles of receptor pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, contains no contradictions, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three specified tasks in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Derive an expression for occupancy ($\\mathrm{Occ}$) as a function of free drug concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{free}}$) and the dissociation constant ($K_d$).\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definitions provided. The reversible binding reaction at equilibrium is described by the dissociation constant $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of the unbound off-target site, $[L]$ is the concentration of the free drug, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the drug-receptor complex. The problem states that the free drug concentration $[L]$ is equivalent to $C_{\\mathrm{free}}$.\n\nThe total concentration of off-target binding sites, $R_T$, is the sum of unbound and bound sites:\n$$R_T = [R] + [RL]$$\nFrom this conservation equation, we can express the unbound receptor concentration as $[R] = R_T - [RL]$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{(R_T - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nOur objective is to find an expression for the occupancy, $\\mathrm{Occ}$, which is defined as:\n$$\\mathrm{Occ} \\equiv \\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$$\nTo do this, we first solve the modified $K_d$ equation for the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $[RL]$ in terms of $R_T$, $[L]$, and $K_d$.\n$$K_d [RL] = (R_T - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_d [RL] = R_T [L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_d [RL] + [RL][L] = R_T [L]$$\n$$[RL](K_d + [L]) = R_T [L]$$\nDividing both sides by $R_T$ gives:\n$$\\frac{[RL]}{R_T}(K_d + [L]) = [L]$$\nRecognizing that $\\mathrm{Occ} = \\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$, we have:\n$$\\mathrm{Occ} (K_d + [L]) = [L]$$\nFinally, solving for $\\mathrm{Occ}$ and replacing $[L]$ with $C_{\\mathrm{free}}$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\\mathrm{Occ} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_d + C_{\\mathrm{free}}}$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation, which describes the fraction of occupied sites as a function of ligand concentration.\n\nTask 2: Obtain the maximum allowable steady-state free concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies a safety limit on occupancy, $S$, such that $\\mathrm{Occ} \\leq S$. The maximum allowable steady-state free concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$, is the concentration at which the occupancy is exactly equal to this safety limit, i.e., $\\mathrm{Occ} = S$.\n\nUsing the expression derived in Task 1, we set $\\mathrm{Occ} = S$ and $C_{\\mathrm{free}} = C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$:\n$$S = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}}{K_d + C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$:\n$$S(K_d + C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}) = C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$$\n$$S K_d + S C_{\\mathrm{free,max}} = C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$$\n$$S K_d = C_{\\mathrm{free,max}} - S C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$$\n$$S K_d = C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}(1 - S)$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{free,max}} = \\frac{S K_d}{1 - S}$$\n\nTask 3: Compute the maximum allowable infusion rate, $R_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$.\n\nThe problem provides the pharmacokinetic relationships for a one-compartment model at steady state under constant-rate intravenous infusion. The steady-state free drug concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{free,ss}}$, is related to the infusion rate, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, by:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{free,ss}} = f_u C_{\\mathrm{tot,ss}} = f_u \\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in}}}{CL}\\right)$$\nwhere $f_u$ is the free fraction of the drug in plasma and $CL$ is the clearance.\n\nThe maximum allowable infusion rate, $R_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$, is the rate that results in the maximum allowable steady-state free concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{free,max}} = \\frac{f_u R_{\\mathrm{in,max}}}{CL}$$\nSolving for $R_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{free,max}} CL}{f_u}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$ from Task 2 into this equation gives the final symbolic formula for $R_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = \\left(\\frac{S K_d}{1 - S}\\right) \\frac{CL}{f_u}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the final answer.\nThe parameters are:\n- $K_d = 20 \\ \\mathrm{nM} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{nmol/L}$\n- $f_u = 0.10$\n- $CL = 5 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}$\n- $S = 0.10$\n\nFirst, we calculate $C_{\\mathrm{free,max}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{free,max}} = \\frac{0.10 \\times (20 \\ \\mathrm{nmol/L})}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{2 \\ \\mathrm{nmol/L}}{0.90} = \\frac{20}{9} \\ \\mathrm{nmol/L}$$\nNext, we calculate $R_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{free,max}} CL}{f_u} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{20}{9} \\ \\mathrm{nmol/L}\\right) \\times (5 \\ \\mathrm{L/h})}{0.10}$$\nThe units are consistent: $(\\mathrm{nmol/L}) \\times (\\mathrm{L/h}) = \\mathrm{nmol/h}$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = \\frac{\\frac{100}{9} \\ \\mathrm{nmol/h}}{0.10} = \\frac{1000}{9} \\ \\mathrm{nmol/h}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in,max}} \\approx 111.111... \\ \\mathrm{nmol/h}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = 111 \\ \\mathrm{nmol/h}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{111}$$", "id": "5036557"}, {"introduction": "While linear pharmacokinetics provide a useful approximation, many therapeutics exhibit more complex, dose-dependent elimination.
