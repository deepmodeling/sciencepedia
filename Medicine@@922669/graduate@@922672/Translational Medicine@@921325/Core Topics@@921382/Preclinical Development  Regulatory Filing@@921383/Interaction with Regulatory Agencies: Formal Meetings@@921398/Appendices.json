The team’s draft question is “Is our Phase 2 design acceptable?” and they seek to reformulate it into a structured, answerable ask. The goal is to phrase the ask so the Agency can provide clear advice on pre-specified elements, consistent with first principles of effective regulatory interactions: questions should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART); focused on decision-enabling content; and grounded in established regulatory science frameworks such as the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9(R1) estimand framework for defining treatment effects in the presence of intercurrent events, and Good Meeting Management Practices (GMMP) for scoping and clarity. In formal meetings, Agencies provide scientific and regulatory advice rather than approvals, using a benefit-risk framework guided by clearly articulated endpoints, analyses, and thresholds. A structured ask should therefore contain the essential design elements (population, intervention, comparator, endpoints, estimand, analysis plan, sample size, error rates), explicit success criteria that are both clinically meaningful and statistically evaluable, and clearly enumerated aspects for which concurrence is sought.\n\nWhich option best reformulates the draft question into a structured, answerable ask that includes the design elements, success criteria, and specific aspects for which agreement is sought?\n\nA.

Questions should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).\n    2.  Questions should be focused on decision-enabling content.\n    3.  Questions must be grounded in established regulatory science frameworks (e.g., ICH E9(R1) estimand framework, Good Meeting Management Practices (GMMP)).\n    4.  The purpose of formal meetings is to receive scientific and regulatory advice, not approvals.\n    5.  Advice is provided within a benefit-risk framework.\n- **Required Components of a Structured Ask:**\n    1.  Essential design elements: population, intervention, comparator, endpoints, estimand, analysis plan, sample size, error rates.\n    2.  Explicit success criteria: clinically meaningful and statistically evaluable.\n    3.  Clearly enumerated aspects for which concurrence is sought.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established practices of pharmaceutical drug development and regulatory science. All concepts mentioned—Phase 2 trials, Type B meetings, FDA, ICH E9(R1), estimands, power calculations, MMRM, etc.—are standard and factually correct within the field of translational medicine. The problem is relevant to the specified topic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of criteria for what constitutes a \"structured, answerable ask\" and then asks to select the option that best meets these criteria. This structure allows for a unique, best solution to be determined through logical evaluation.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is objective, using precise, technical language. The criteria for evaluation are explicitly stated and are based on established professional and regulatory standards (GMMP, ICH guidances), not subjective opinion.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution will proceed by evaluating each option against the specified criteria.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will evaluate each option against the three core requirements for a structured question as stipulated in the problem statement: (1) inclusion of essential design elements, (2) definition of explicit success criteria, and (3) enumeration of specific aspects for which concurrence is sought. The evaluation will also consider adherence to the general principles of effective regulatory interaction.\n\n**A. Evaluation of Option A**\n\nThis option proposes the following question: \"Does the Agency concur that, for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in adults with moderate-to-severe disease defined by baseline Disease Activity Index (DAI) $\\,\\ge\\,6$, our proposed design—total sample size $n=180$, $2:1$ randomization to investigational biologic at a fixed dose versus placebo, $12$-week treatment, primary endpoint change from baseline in DAI at week $12$, estimand defined using the treatment policy strategy per ICH E9(R1), primary analysis via mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for baseline DAI and stratification factors, two-sided type I error $\\alpha=0.05$, power $1-\\beta=0.90$ to detect a mean difference $\\Delta=2.0$ points—with success declared if the observed mean difference is $\\ge \\Delta$ and the $95\\%$ confidence interval excludes $0$, and safety success defined as no increase in serious adverse events with a relative risk $>1.5$—is acceptable for the following specific aspects: (i) acceptability of the primary endpoint and estimand; (ii) handling of intercurrent events (rescue medication and treatment discontinuation) under a treatment policy strategy; (iii) control of familywise type I error at $\\alpha=0.05$ across key secondary endpoints using Hochberg procedures; (iv) an interim futility boundary triggered at conditional power $<0.20$ without unblinding by treatment arm; and (v) use of exposure–response analysis to justify Phase 3 dose selection contingent on observing effect size $\\Delta$?\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** This option is comprehensive. It specifies the Population (adults, moderate-to-severe disease, DAI $\\,\\ge\\,6$), Intervention (biologic), Comparator (placebo), Endpoint (change in DAI at week $12$), Estimand (treatment policy), Analysis plan (MMRM), and Sample size/statistical parameters ($n=180$, $2:1$ ratio, $\\alpha=0.05$, $1-\\beta=0.90$, $\\Delta=2.0$). It covers all required components.\n2.  **Success Criteria:** It provides explicit, statistically evaluable success criteria for both efficacy (observed mean difference $\\ge \\Delta$ and $95\\%$ CI excludes $0$) and safety (relative risk of serious adverse events $\\le 1.5$).\n3.  **Specific Aspects for Concurrence:** It breaks the general request for acceptability into five discrete, technically specific, and decision-relevant questions. This aligns perfectly with GMMP and enables the agency to provide targeted, actionable advice.\n\nThis option fully adheres to all principles outlined in the problem statement. It transforms the vague initial question into a precise, multi-part query suitable for a formal regulatory meeting.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Evaluation of Option B**\n\nThis option proposes: \"Is our Phase 2 design acceptable, and will FDA approve the drug if the trial meets its endpoints?\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** None are specified. The question is generic.\n2.  **Success Criteria:** None are specified.\n3.  **Specific Aspects for Concurrence:** None are enumerated.\n4.  **Regulatory Principles:** This question has two critical flaws. First, \"Is our Phase 2 design acceptable?\" is the exact vague question the problem seeks to improve. Second, asking for a pre-commitment to approval (\"will FDA approve the drug...\") is inappropriate for any formal meeting, especially at the End-of-Phase 2 stage. The agency provides advice, not guarantees of future approval.\n\nThis option fails on all criteria for a structured ask.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Evaluation of Option C**\n\nThis option proposes: \"Please confirm our overall development program is adequate, including our Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) strategy, nonclinical toxicology package, clinical pharmacology, labeling goals, Phase 2 study design, budget, and timelines, and that our proposed dose will be commercially viable.\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** While it mentions \"Phase 2 study design\", it provides no details.\n2.  **Regulatory Principles:** This question is excessively broad and violates the principle of focused questions (GMMP). A single Type B meeting is not the forum to review an entire development program spanning CMC, nonclinical, and clinical. Furthermore, it asks for feedback on non-regulatory items such as \"budget,\" \"timelines,\" and \"commercial viability,\" which are outside the FDA's purview.\n\nThis option is improperly scoped and includes inappropriate topics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Evaluation of Option D**\n\nThis option proposes: \"Does the Agency agree that any positive change in DAI at week $12$ is clinically meaningful and that per-protocol analysis without adjustment for multiplicity is sufficient, given our planned $n=90$, single-arm Phase 2 study with $\\alpha=0.10$ one-sided and $1-\\beta=0.70$?\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** It specifies some elements ($n=90$, single-arm design, $\\alpha=0.10$, $1-\\beta=0.70$) but these describe a scientifically weak design. For a well-characterized disease, a single-arm study lacks a concurrent control and is generally insufficient for robust efficacy evaluation. A per-protocol analysis as the primary approach is disfavored due to bias. The statistical parameters ($\\alpha=0.10$, $1-\\beta=0.70$) are lax.\n2.  **Regulatory Principles:** This option asks for agreement on a flawed scientific approach. A sponsor should propose a robust, defensible plan, not a minimal one. The claim that \"any positive change...is clinically meaningful\" is also a weak assertion that requires substantial justification. This question represents a poor regulatory strategy, not an effective one.\n\nThis option proposes a scientifically questionable design and analysis plan, which is contrary to the goal of seeking advice on a robust program.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Evaluation of Option E**\n\nThis option proposes: \"Does the Agency concur with our plan to randomize $n=150$ participants $1:1$ to drug versus placebo with a $16$-week treatment period and DAI change at week $16$ as the primary endpoint, analyzed by analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline DAI, and that we will collect safety and pharmacokinetic data as exploratory measures?\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** It provides some key elements (Population is implied, Intervention, Comparator, Endpoint, some Analysis details, Sample size). However, it is critically incomplete.\n2.  **Missing Components:** It fails to specify the estimand and how intercurrent events will be handled, which is a key component of modern trial design per ICH E9(R1). It omits the target effect size, power ($1-\\beta$), and type I error rate ($\\alpha$).\n3.  **Success Criteria:** No explicit criteria for trial success are defined.\n4.  **Specific Aspects for Concurrence:** The question is a single, monolithic request for concurrence on a partial plan rather than an enumerated list of specific points for discussion.\n\nThis option is an improvement over B, C, and D, but it is substantially less complete and structured than option A. It omits several key components required by the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A is the only choice that comprehensively and correctly incorporates all the required components of a structured, answerable question for a formal regulatory meeting as described in the problem statement. It presents a complete and robust clinical trial design, defines clear success criteria, and enumerates specific, decision-relevant points for which agency concurrence is sought, demonstrating a high level of regulatory and scientific acumen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5025107"}, {"introduction": "Once your strategic questions are defined, you must support them with evidence and argumentation in the briefing package.

The use of \"approximately $60$ minutes\" is a common feature in such problems and is conventionally interpreted as exactly $60$ minutes for the purpose of calculation.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using clear, objective language. The complexity scores are provided as data points, not as subjective values to be determined.\n\nThe problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, and is not metaphorical. It is a well-defined, formalizable problem with a clear and unique solution path. It is neither trivial nor ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to determine the page count allocated to each of five questions in a briefing package, based on a total page budget and the relative complexity of each question.\n\nFirst, we determine the total page budget ($P_{total}$) for the briefing package. This budget is equivalent to the agency's expected pre-meeting review capacity. The problem provides the review rate ($R$) and the total review time ($T$).\n\nThe given rate is $R = 50$ pages per hour.\nThe given time is $T = 60$ minutes.\n\nTo maintain consistent units, we convert the time from minutes to hours.\n$$T = 60 \\text{ min} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ min}} = 1 \\text{ hour}$$\n\nThe total page capacity is the product of the rate and the time, as per the definition of a constant rate.\n$$P_{total} = R \\times T$$\n$$P_{total} = \\left(50 \\frac{\\text{pages}}{\\text{hour}}\\right) \\times (1 \\text{ hour}) = 50 \\text{ pages}$$\nThe total briefing package page budget is therefore $50$ pages.\n\nNext, we must distribute this total page count among the five questions according to their assigned complexity scores. This is a proportional allocation problem. Let the complexity scores for the five questions be denoted by $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4,$ and $s_5$.\n-   $s_1 = 3$\n-   $s_2 = 2$\n-   $s_3 = 2$\n-   $s_4 = 1$\n-   $s_5 = 2$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of all complexity scores, $S_{total}$.\n$$S_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} s_i = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 + s_5$$\n$$S_{total} = 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10$$\n\nThe fraction of the total page budget allocated to question $i$ is the ratio of its complexity score $s_i$ to the total complexity score $S_{total}$. The page count for question $i$, denoted as $P_i$, is then this fraction multiplied by the total page budget $P_{total}$.\n$$P_i = P_{total} \\times \\frac{s_i}{S_{total}}$$\n\nWe apply this formula for each of the five questions:\n\nFor Question 1 ($s_1=3$):\n$$P_1 = 50 \\times \\frac{3}{10} = 15 \\text{ pages}$$\n\nFor Question 2 ($s_2=2$):\n$$P_2 = 50 \\times \\frac{2}{10} = 10 \\text{ pages}$$\n\nFor Question 3 ($s_3=2$):\n$$P_3 = 50 \\times \\frac{2}{10} = 10 \\text{ pages}$$\n\nFor Question 4 ($s_4=1$):\n$$P_4 = 50 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 5 \\text{ pages}$$\n\nFor Question 5 ($s_5=2$):\n$$P_5 = 50 \\times \\frac{2}{10} = 10 \\text{ pages}$$\n\nTo verify the calculation, the sum of the individual page counts must equal the total page budget:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{5} P_i = 15 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 10 = 50$$\nThis matches the calculated $P_{total}$.\n\nThe final answer is the set of page counts $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5\\}$, expressed as a single row vector.\nThe page counts are $15$, $10$, $10$, $5$, and $10$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n15 & 10 & 10 & 5 & 10\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5025196"}, {"introduction": "Effective interaction with regulatory agencies is not only about what you ask, but also *when* you ask it.

The solution is derived by constructing a timeline based on the provided constraints and applying the stated optimization criterion.\n\nLet us define the relevant variables and parameters based on the problem statement.\n- Let $M$ denote a calendar month, represented by an integer from $1$ (January) to $12$ (December).\n- The calendar quarters are defined as $Q1 = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $Q2 = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$, $Q3 = \\{7, 8, 9\\}$, and $Q4 = \\{10, 11, 12\\}$.\n- Let $M_{tox}$ be the month when the final Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology study results become available. According to the problem, this occurs in \"mid-$Q2$\", which is specified as month $5$. Thus, $M_{tox} = 5$.\n- Let $T_{prep}$ be the duration of the internal drafting and quality-control cycle required to finalize the meeting materials. This is given as $30$ days, which is modeled as $1$ calendar month. So, $T_{prep} = 1$ month.\n- Let $T_{FDA}$ be the FDA's scheduling goal for a Type B meeting. This is given as $60$ days, which is modeled as $2$ calendar months. So, $T_{FDA} = 2$ months.\n- Let $M_{submit}$ be the calendar month in which the sponsor submits the meeting request. This is the value we are tasked to determine.\n- Let $M_{meeting}$ be the calendar month in which the pre-IND meeting is held.\n\nThe logical sequence of events is governed by several constraints.\n\nFirst Constraint: Package Readiness. The meeting request requires a complete briefing package. The preparation of this package takes $T_{prep} = 1$ month and commences once the GLP tox results are available. The results are available in month $M_{tox} = 5$. The preparation work is therefore completed during the subsequent month. This implies that the earliest the complete package is ready for submission is at the beginning of month $6$. Let $M_{ready}$ be the first month in which submission is possible.\n$$M_{ready} = M_{tox} + T_{prep} = 5 + 1 = 6$$\nTherefore, any valid submission month $M_{submit}$ must satisfy the condition:\n$$M_{submit} \\ge 6$$\n\nSecond Constraint: FDA Scheduling Timeline. The problem states that Type B meetings are scheduled to occur within $60$ days, modeled as $T_{FDA} = 2$ months, of the receipt of the request. The relationship between the meeting month and the submission month can be written as:\n$$M_{meeting} = M_{submit} + T_{FDA} = M_{submit} + 2$$\n\nThird Constraint: Target Meeting Quarter. The sponsor aims to hold the meeting in the third quarter, $Q3$, to maximize preparedness for the $Q4$ study start. The months in $Q3$ are $\\{7, 8, 9\\}$. This imposes a constraint on the meeting month:\n$$M_{meeting} \\in \\{7, 8, 9\\}$$\n\nWe can now combine these constraints to determine the set of permissible submission months. By substituting the expression for $M_{meeting}$ from the second constraint into the third constraint, we obtain:\n$$M_{submit} + 2 \\in \\{7, 8, 9\\}$$\nSolving for $M_{submit}$ by subtracting $2$ from each element in the set gives the possible range for the submission month based on the desired meeting quarter:\n$$M_{submit} \\in \\{7-2, 8-2, 9-2\\}$$\n$$M_{submit} \\in \\{5, 6, 7\\}$$\n\nThis set of potential submission months must also satisfy the first constraint, which is that the briefing package must be ready ($M_{submit} \\ge 6$). We find the intersection of the two conditions for $M_{submit}$:\n$$M_{submit} \\in \\{5, 6, 7\\} \\cap \\{M \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid M \\ge 6\\}$$\nThe resulting set of valid submission months is:\n$$M_{submit} \\in \\{6, 7\\}$$\n\nThis indicates two possible scenarios:\n- If the sponsor submits in $M_{submit} = 6$, the meeting will occur in $M_{meeting} = 6 + 2 = 8$. Month $8$ is in $Q3$.\n- If the sponsor submits in $M_{submit} = 7$, the meeting will occur in $M_{meeting} = 7 + 2 = 9$. Month $9$ is in $Q3$.\n\nThe final step is to apply the optimization criterion: \"to maximize the buffer to incorporate FDA feedback before the planned first-in-human start in $Q4$.\" A larger buffer is achieved by holding the meeting as early as possible. A meeting in month $8$ provides a larger buffer before $Q4$ (which begins in month $10$) than a meeting in month $9$. The earlier meeting in month $8$ results from the earlier submission in month $6$.\n\nTherefore, the optimal calendar month for the sponsor to submit the pre-IND meeting request is month $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "5025187"}]}
