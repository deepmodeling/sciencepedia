Conventionally, the numerical value of $RR$ in seconds is used in the formula, and the resulting index $Q$ is expressed in milliseconds (ms).\n\n### Step 2: Calculation and Statistical Analysis of Corrected QT (Q)\nFor each treatment group, we first compute the individual corrected QT values, $Q_i$, for each data pair $(RR_i, QT_i)$. Subsequently, we calculate the mean ($\\bar{x}$) and sample standard deviation ($s$) for the set of $Q_i$ values in each group.\n\nThe formulas for the mean and sample standard deviation for a set of $n$ values $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$ are:\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\n\nThe calculations for each treatment group are as follows, with $n=8$ for all groups.\n\n**Treatment: Vehicle**\nThe data are pairs of $(RR, QT)$. The calculated $Q_i = QT_i / RR_i^{1/3}$ values are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $Q_1 = 221.3 / (0.80)^{1/3} \\approx 238.381$ ms\n    \\item $Q_2 = 223.3 / (0.78)^{1/3} \\approx 242.768$ ms\n    \\item $Q_3 = 221.2 / (0.82)^{1/3} \\approx 236.347$ ms\n    \\item $Q_4 = 220.3 / (0.76)^{1/3} \\approx 241.317$ ms\n    \\item $Q_5 = 226.4 / (0.84)^{1/3} \\approx 240.002$ ms\n    \\item $Q_6 = 220.1 / (0.79)^{1/3} \\approx 238.188$ ms\n    \\item $Q_7 = 224.9 / (0.81)^{1/3} \\approx 241.282$ ms\n    \\item $Q_8 = 219.6 / (0.77)^{1/3} \\approx 239.532$ ms\n\\end{itemize}\nMean: $\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{veh}} \\approx 239.727$ ms\nSample Standard Deviation: $s_{\\mathrm{veh}} \\approx 2.066$ ms\nRounded to one decimal place: $\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{veh}} \\approx 239.7$ ms, $s_{\\mathrm{veh}} \\approx 2.1$ ms.\n\n**Treatment: LowDose**\nThe calculated $Q_i$ values are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $Q_1 = 220.35 / (0.70)^{1/3} \\approx 248.163$ ms\n    \\item $Q_2 = 219.60 / (0.72)^{1/3} \\approx 245.011$ ms\n    \\item $Q_3 = 224.56 / (0.74)^{1/3} \\approx 248.272$ ms\n    \\item $Q_4 = 214.83 / (0.68)^{1/3} \\approx 244.301$ ms\n    \\item $Q_5 = 223.99 / (0.75)^{1/3} \\approx 246.523$ ms\n    \\item $Q_6 = 221.52 / (0.73)^{1/3} \\approx 246.024$ ms\n    \\item $Q_7 = 215.39 / (0.69)^{1/3} \\approx 243.759$ ms\n    \\item $Q_8 = 220.90 / (0.71)^{1/3} \\approx 247.619$ ms\n\\end{itemize}\nMean: $\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{low}} \\approx 246.209$ ms\nSample Standard Deviation: $s_{\\mathrm{low}} \\approx 1.749$ ms\nRounded to one decimal place: $\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{low}} \\approx 246.2$ ms, $s_{\\mathrm{low}} \\approx 1.7$ ms.\n\n**Treatment: HighDose**\nThe calculated $Q_i$ values are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $Q_1 = 247.24 / (0.90)^{1/3} \\approx 256.077$ ms\n    \\item $Q_2 = 248.21 / (0.95)^{1/3} \\approx 252.503$ ms\n    \\item $Q_3 = 248.05 / (0.92)^{1/3} \\approx 255.064$ ms\n    \\item $Q_4 = 254.00 / (1.00)^{1/3} = 254.000$ ms\n    \\item $Q_5 = 245.01 / (0.88)^{1/3} \\approx 255.666$ ms\n    \\item $Q_6 = 248.99 / (0.96)^{1/3} \\approx 252.394$ ms\n    \\item $Q_7 = 246.63 / (0.91)^{1/3} \\approx 254.520$ ms\n    \\item $Q_8 = 243.35 / (0.89)^{1/3} \\approx 252.993$ ms\n\\end{itemize}\nMean: $\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{high}} \\approx 254.152$ ms\nSample Standard Deviation: $s_{\\mathrm{high}} \\approx 1.470$ ms\nRounded to one decimal place: $\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{high}} \\approx 254.2$ ms, $s_{\\mathrm{high}} \\approx 1.5$ ms.\n\n\n### Step 3: Assessment of Treatment Effect\nWe compute the difference in mean corrected QT, $\\Delta_d = \\bar{x}_d - \\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{veh}}$, for each drug-treated group $d$ and compare it to the assay sensitivity threshold $S = 7.0$ ms.
