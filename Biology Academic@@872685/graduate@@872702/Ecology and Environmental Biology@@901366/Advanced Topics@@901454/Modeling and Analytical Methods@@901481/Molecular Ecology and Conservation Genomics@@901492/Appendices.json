Assume discrete generations, symmetric migration, and no selection or mutation. Each island (deme) has the same effective population size ($N_e$), and in each generation, a fraction $m$ of individuals in each deme are migrants drawn at random from the entire metapopulation. Let $p_i$ denote the allele frequency in deme $i$, and let $\\bar{p}$ denote the metapopulation mean frequency, which remains approximately constant over time at the scale considered.

It is a standard problem in theoretical population genetics, based on the foundational Wright-Fisher model and the infinite-island model of migration. All parameters and definitions are provided and are consistent with established theory. The problem is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an approximate expression for the equilibrium fixation index, $F_{ST}$, under a balance between genetic drift and migration, and then to calculate its value for the given parameters. The derivation proceeds from the dynamics of allele frequencies over one generation.\n\nLet $p_{i,t}$ be the frequency of an allele in deme $i$ at generation $t$. The metapopulation average frequency is $\\bar{p}$, which is constant under the assumption of symmetric migration and no selection or mutation on a global scale. The among-deme variance in allele frequency at generation $t$ is $V_t = \\mathrm{Var}(p_t) = \\mathrm{E}[(p_{i,t} - \\bar{p})^2]$, where the expectation is over all demes.\n\nOne generation cycle consists of two sequential processes: migration followed by genetic drift.\n\n1.  **Migration**: After migration, the allele frequency in deme $i$, denoted $p'_{i,t}$, is a convex combination of the local frequency and the metapopulation mean frequency:\n    $$p'_{i,t} = (1-m)p_{i,t} + m\\bar{p}$$\n    where $m$ is the migration rate.\n\n2.  **Genetic Drift**: The new generation is formed by random sampling of $2N_e$ gametes from the post-migration gene pool of each deme. This is the Wright-Fisher sampling process. For a given $p'_{i,t}$, the allele frequency in the next generation, $p_{i,t+1}$, is a random variable with conditional expectation and variance:\n    $$\\mathrm{E}[p_{i,t+1} | p'_{i,t}] = p'_{i,t}$$\n    $$\\mathrm{Var}(p_{i,t+1} | p'_{i,t}) = \\frac{p'_{i,t}(1-p'_{i,t})}{2N_e}$$\n\nWe need to find the recursion for the among-deme variance, $V_{t+1} = \\mathrm{Var}(p_{t+1})$.

Let us consider a large initial pool of $K$ total reads from the true heterozygous sites. By assumption (iv) and (ii), these consist of $\\frac{K}{2}$ reference-allele reads and $\\frac{K}{2}$ alternate-allele reads.\nAccording to assumption (iii):\n- Number of mapped reference-allele reads: $R_{\\text{map}} = \\frac{K}{2}$.\n- Number of mapped alternate-allele reads: $A_{\\text{map}} = (1-c)\\frac{K}{2}$.\nThe total number of mapped reads is $D_{\\text{map}} = R_{\\text{map}} + A_{\\text{map}} = \\frac{K}{2} + (1-c)\\frac{K}{2} = \\frac{K}{2}(2-c)$.\nThe allele balance $b$ is the ratio of mapped alternate reads to total mapped reads:\n$$b = \\frac{A_{\\text{map}}}{D_{\\text{map}}} = \\frac{(1-c)\\frac{K}{2}}{\\frac{K}{2}(2-c)} = \\frac{1-c}{2-c}$$\nTo express $c$ in terms of $b$, we solve this equation for $c$:\n$$b(2-c) = 1-c$$\n$$2b - bc = 1-c$$\n$$c - bc = 1-2b$$\n$$c(1-b) = 1-2b$$\n$$c = \\frac{1-2b}{1-b}$$\nWe can now compute the MLE for $c$, denoted $\\hat{c}$, by substituting $\\hat{b}$:\n$$\\hat{c} = \\frac{1-2\\hat{b}}{1-\\hat{b}} = \\frac{1-2(0.37)}{1-0.37} = \\frac{1-0.74}{0.63} = \\frac{0.26}{0.63} = \\frac{26}{63}$$\n\nPart 2: Prediction of the post-mitigation expected allele balance $b'$.\n\nThe mitigation strategy recovers a fraction $r=0.65$ of the previously lost alternate-allele reads. The number of reference-allele reads remains unchanged.\nThe number of alternate-allele reads lost before mitigation was $c\\frac{K}{2}$.\nThe number of alternate-allele reads recovered by the mitigation is $r \\left( c\\frac{K}{2} \\right)$.\nThe new number of mapped alternate-allele reads, $A'_{\\text{map}}$, is the sum of those originally mapped and those recovered:\n$$A'_{\\text{map}} = A_{\\text{map}} + r c \\frac{K}{2} = (1-c)\\frac{K}{2} + rc\\frac{K}{2} = (1-c+rc)\\frac{K}{2} = (1-c(1-r))\\frac{K}{2}$$\nThe new total number of mapped reads, $D'_{\\text{map}}$, is the sum of mapped reference reads and the new number of mapped alternate reads:\n$$D'_{\\text{map}} = R_{\\text{map}} + A'_{\\text{map}} = \\frac{K}{2} + (1-c(1-r))\\frac{K}{2} = \\frac{K}{2}(1 + 1-c(1-r)) = \\frac{K}{2}(2-c(1-r))$$\nThe post-mitigation expected allele balance, $b'$, is the ratio of $A'_{\\text{map}}$ to $D'_{\\text{map}}$:\n$$b' = \\frac{A'_{\\text{map}}}{D'_{\\text{map}}} = \\frac{(1-c(1-r))\\frac{K}{2}}{\\frac{K}{2}(2-c(1-r))} = \\frac{1-c(1-r)}{2-c(1-r)}$$\nWe substitute the estimated value $\\hat{c} = \\frac{26}{63}$ and the given recovery fraction $r = 0.65$:\nFirst, we compute the term $c(1-r)$:\n$$\\hat{c}(1-r) = \\frac{26}{63} (1-0.65) = \\frac{26}{63} (0.35) = \\frac{26}{63} \\times \\frac{35}{100} = \\frac{26}{63} \\times \\frac{7}{20} = \\frac{26 \\times 7}{9 \\times 7 \\times 20} = \\frac{26}{180} = \\frac{13}{90}$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $b'$:\n$$b' = \\frac{1 - \\frac{13}{90}}{2 - \\frac{13}{90}} = \\frac{\\frac{90-13}{90}}{\\frac{180-13}{90}} = \\frac{77}{167}$$\nTo provide the final numerical answer, we compute the decimal value and round to four significant figures:\n$$b' = \\frac{77}{167} \\approx 0.4610778...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4611$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4611}$$", "id": "2510246"}]}
