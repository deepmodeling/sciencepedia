The analysis proceeds by first establishing the conditions for the existence of a strictly positive equilibrium, and second, determining the conditions for the local asymptotic stability of that equilibrium.\n\nLet the species abundances be denoted by the vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)^{\\top}$. The Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) system is given by\n$$\n\\frac{dx_{i}}{dt} = x_{i} \\left(r_{i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{ij} x_{j}\\right), \\quad i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n$$\nwith parameters $r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{3}=r0$ and the interaction matrix\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-d  m  0 \\\\\nm  -d  m \\\\\n0  m  -d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $d0$ and $m \\ge 0$.\n\nAn equilibrium solution, $\\mathbf{x}^* = (x_1^*, x_2^*, x_3^*)^{\\top}$, is found by setting $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0}$. We seek a strictly positive equilibrium, where $x_i^*  0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. For such an equilibrium, the condition simplifies to the linear system:\n$$\nr_{i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{ij} x_{j}^* = 0, \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n$$\nIn matrix form, this is $A \\mathbf{x}^* = -\\mathbf{r}$, where $\\mathbf{r} = (r, r, r)^{\\top}$. The system of equations is:\n\\begin{align*}\n-d x_1^* + m x_2^* \\quad = -r \\quad (1) \\\\\nm x_1^* - d x_2^* + m x_3^* = -r \\quad (2) \\\\\nm x_2^* - d x_3^* = -r \\quad (3)\n\\end{align*}\nFrom equations $(1)$ and $(3)$, we have $d x_1^* - r = m x_2^* = d x_3^* - r$, which implies $d x_1^* = d x_3^*$. Since $d0$, we must have $x_1^* = x_3^*$. This symmetry is expected from the structure of the interaction matrix $A$.\n\nSubstituting $x_3^* = x_1^*$ into equation $(2)$ yields $2m x_1^* - d x_2^* = -r$. We now have a system of two linear equations for $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$:\n\\begin{align*}\n-d x_1^* + m x_2^* = -r \\\\\n2m x_1^* - d x_2^* = -r\n\\end{align*}\nSolving this system, for instance by multiplying the first equation by $d$ and the second by $m$ and adding them, gives $(-d^2 + 2m^2)x_1^* = -dr - mr = -r(d+m)$. This yields:\n$$\nx_1^* = \\frac{-r(d+m)}{2m^2 - d^2} = \\frac{r(d+m)}{d^2 - 2m^2}\n$$\nFrom $x_1^* = x_3^*$, we have $x_3^* = \\frac{r(d+m)}{d^2 - 2m^2}$. Now, we solve for $x_2^*$. From equation $(1)$, $m x_2^* = d x_1^* - r$.\n$$\nm x_2^* = d \\left( \\frac{r(d+m)}{d^2 - 2m^2} \\right) - r = r \\left( \\frac{d(d+m)}{d^2 - 2m^2} - 1 \\right) = r \\left( \\frac{d^2+md - (d^2 - 2m^2)}{d^2 - 2m^2} \\right) = r \\frac{md+2m^2}{d^2 - 2m^2} = r \\frac{m(d+2m)}{d^2 - 2m^2}\n$$\nFor $m0$, we can divide by $m$ to get $x_2^* = \\frac{r(d+2m)}{d^2 - 2m^2}$. If $m=0$, the system decouples and one finds $x_i^*=r/d  0$. The derived formulae are consistent with this limit.\n\nFor the equilibrium to be strictly positive ($x_i^*  0$), given that $r0$, $d0$, and $m \\ge 0$, the numerators $r(d+m)$ and $r(d+2m)$ are strictly positive. Thus, the condition for positivity rests entirely on the sign of the common denominator:\n$$\nd^2 - 2m^2  0 \\implies d^2  2m^2\n$$\nSince $d$ and $m$ are non-negative, this is equivalent to $d  \\sqrt{2} m$, or $m  d/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the local asymptotic stability of this equilibrium. The stability is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$ evaluated at the equilibrium $\\mathbf{x}^*$. The elements of the Jacobian are:\n$$\nJ_{ik}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_i}{\\partial x_k} = \\delta_{ik}\\left(r_{i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{ij} x_{j}\\right) + x_{i} a_{ik}\n$$\nAt equilibrium $\\mathbf{x}^*$, the term in parentheses is zero, so the Jacobian is $J^* = J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ with elements $J_{ik}^* = x_i^* a_{ik}$. This can be written in matrix form as $J^* = D_x A$, where $D_x = \\text{diag}(x_1^*, x_2^*, x_3^*)$ is a diagonal matrix with positive entries.\n\nThe equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues of $J^*$ have negative real parts. To analyze the eigenvalues of $J^* = D_x A$, we perform a similarity transformation, which preserves eigenvalues. Let $D_x^{1/2} = \\text{diag}(\\sqrt{x_1^*}, \\sqrt{x_2^*}, \\sqrt{x_3^*})$. Consider the matrix $S$:\n$$\nS = D_x^{1/2} A D_x^{1/2}\n$$\nThe Jacobian $J^*$ is similar to $S$ because $S = D_x^{-1/2} J^* D_x^{1/2}$. Since $A$ is a real symmetric matrix and $D_x^{1/2}$ is real and diagonal (hence symmetric), the matrix $S$ is also real and symmetric:\n$$\nS^{\\top} = (D_x^{1/2} A D_x^{1/2})^{\\top} = (D_x^{1/2})^{\\top} A^{\\top} (D_x^{1/2})^{\\top} = D_x^{1/2} A D_x^{1/2} = S\n$$\nA real symmetric matrix has only real eigenvalues. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $S$, and thus of $J^*$, are all real. For asymptotic stability, all eigenvalues must be strictly negative. This is equivalent to the condition that $S$ is a negative definite matrix.\n\nA matrix $S$ is negative definite if and only if $\\mathbf{z}^{\\top} S \\mathbf{z}  0$ for all non-zero vectors $\\mathbf{z}$. Substituting the definition of $S$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{z}^{\\top} (D_x^{1/2} A D_x^{1/2}) \\mathbf{z}  0\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{y} = D_x^{1/2} \\mathbf{z}$. Since $D_x^{1/2}$ is invertible, $\\mathbf{y}$ is a non-zero vector if and only if $\\mathbf{z}$ is a non-zero vector. The condition becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}^{\\top} A \\mathbf{y}  0\n$$\nfor all non-zero vectors $\\mathbf{y}$. This is precisely the definition of the matrix $A$ being negative definite.\n\nTo determine when the symmetric matrix $A$ is negative definite, we apply Sylvester's criterion to the matrix $-A$. The matrix $-A$ must be positive definite, which means all of its leading principal minors must be strictly positive.\n$$\n-A = \\begin{pmatrix}\nd  -m  0 \\\\\n-m  d  -m \\\\\n0  -m  d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first leading principal minor is $\\Delta_1 = d$. The condition is $\\Delta_1  0$, which is given as $d0$.\nThe second leading principal minor is:\n$$\n\\Delta_2 = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} d  -m \\\\ -m  d \\end{pmatrix} = d^2 - m^2\n$$\nThe condition is $\\Delta_2  0$, which implies $d^2  m^2$, or $d  m$ since $d, m \\ge 0$.\nThe third leading principal minor is $\\Delta_3 = \\det(-A)$:\n$$\n\\Delta_3 = d(d^2 - m^2) - (-m)(-md) = d^3 - dm^2 - dm^2 = d^3 - 2dm^2 = d(d^2 - 2m^2)\n$$\nThe condition is $\\Delta_3  0$. Since $d0$, this simplifies to $d^2 - 2m^2  0$, which is $d  \\sqrt{2} m$.\n\nThe set of conditions for stability is $\\{d0, dm, d\\sqrt{2} m\\}$. Since $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414  1$, the condition $d  \\sqrt{2} m$ is the most restrictive and implies $dm$. Thus, the condition for local asymptotic stability is $m  d/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nRemarkably, the condition for the existence of a strictly positive equilibrium ($m  d/\\sqrt{2}$) is identical to the condition for its local asymptotic stability. Therefore, the system admits a strictly positive, locally asymptotically stable equilibrium if and only if $0 \\le m  d/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest value $m_{\\max}$ such that for every $m$ in the interval $0 \\le m  m_{\\max}$, the desired equilibrium exists and is stable. From our derived condition $0 \\le m  d/\\sqrt{2}$, we can directly identify $m_{\\max}$.\n$$\nm_{\\max} = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}}}$$", "id": "2510887"}, {"introduction": "Building on the analysis of simple systems, we now turn to the influence of network architecture on stability.

Let $F(N,P) = aN/(1+ahN+cP)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial N} = r\\left(1-\\frac{2N}{K}\\right) - P \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N}, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial P} = -F - P \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial P}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial N} = eP \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N}, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial P} = eF - m + eP\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial P}\n$$\nAt equilibrium $(N^{\\ast}, P^{\\ast})$, we have $eF(N^{\\ast},P^{\\ast}) - m = 0$. So, the Jacobian elements become:\n$$\nJ_{11} = r\\left(1-\\frac{2N^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - P^{\\ast} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N}\\bigg|_{(N^{\\ast},P^{\\ast})}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{22} = eP^{\\ast}\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial P}\\bigg|_{(N^{\\ast},P^{\\ast})}\n$$\nThe trace is $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = J_{11} + J_{22}$. The Hopf bifurcation occurs when $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = 0$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = r\\left(1-\\frac{2N^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - P^{\\ast}\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N}\\bigg|_{(N^{\\ast},P^{\\ast})} + eP^{\\ast}\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial P}\\bigg|_{(N^{\\ast},P^{\\ast})} = 0\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $F$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N} = \\frac{a(1+cP)}{D^2}, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial P} = \\frac{-acN}{D^2}\n$$\nThe trace condition becomes:\n$$\nr\\left(1-\\frac{2N^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - P^{\\ast}\\frac{a(1+cP^{\\ast})}{(D^{\\ast})^2} + eP^{\\ast}\\frac{-acN^{\\ast}}{(D^{\\ast})^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nr\\left(1-\\frac{2N^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) = \\frac{aP^{\\ast}}{(D^{\\ast})^2} (1+cP^{\\ast}+ecN^{\\ast})\n$$\nSubstitute $D^{\\ast} = eaN^{\\ast}/m$:\n$$\nr\\left(1-\\frac{2N^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) = \\frac{aP^{\\ast}}{(eaN^{\\ast}/m)^2} (1+cP^{\\ast}+ecN^{\\ast}) = \\frac{m^2 P^{\\ast}}{e^2 a^2(N^{\\ast})^2} (1+cP^{\\ast}+ecN^{\\ast})\n$$\nFrom the prey nullcline, $r(1-N^{\\ast}/K) = mP^{\\ast}/(eN^{\\ast})$. We can write the LHS of the trace condition as $r(1-N^{\\ast}/K) - rN^{\\ast}/K = mP^{\\ast}/(eN^{\\ast}) - rN^{\\ast}/K$. So the condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{mP^{\\ast}}{eN^{\\ast}} - \\frac{rN^{\\ast}}{K} = \\frac{m^2 P^{\\ast}}{e^2 a (N^{\\ast})^2} (1+cP^{\\ast}+ecN^{\\ast})\n$$\nDividing by $mP^{\\ast}/(eN^{\\ast})$ (since $P^{\\ast}0, N^{\\ast}0, m0, e0$):\n$$\n1 - \\frac{r e (N^{\\ast})^2}{K m P^{\\ast}} = \\frac{m}{eaN^{\\ast}}(1+cP^{\\ast}+ecN^{\\ast})\n$$\nFrom the prey nullcline again, $r/P^{\\ast} = m/(eN^{\\ast}(1-N^{\\ast}/K))$. Substituting this:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{e(N^{\\ast})^2}{K m} \\frac{m}{eN^{\\ast}(1-N^{\\ast}/K)} = 1 - \\frac{N^{\\ast}/K}{1-N^{\\ast}/K} = \\frac{1-2N^{\\ast}/K}{1-N^{\\ast}/K}\n$$\nTherefore, we have an equation for $N^{\\ast}$ at the bifurcation point, let's call it $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, which is independent of $r$ and $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1-2N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K}{1-N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K} = \\frac{m}{eaN_{\\mathrm{crit}}}(1+cP^{\\ast}+ecN_{\\mathrm{crit}})\n$$\nTo eliminate $P^{\\ast}$, we use the predator isocline: $cP^{\\ast} = (eaN^{\\ast}/m) - 1 - ahN^{\\ast} = aN^{\\ast}(e/m - h) - 1$.\nThe term $1+cP^{\\ast}$ becomes $aN^{\\ast}(e/m-h)$.\nSo, $1+cP^{\\ast}+ecN^{\\ast} = aN^{\\ast}(e/m-h) + ecN^{\\ast} = N^{\\ast}(ae/m - ah + ec)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1-2N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K}{1-N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K} = \\frac{m}{eaN_{\\mathrm{crit}}} \\left[ N_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\left(\\frac{ae}{m} - ah + ec\\right) \\right] = \\frac{m}{ea}\\left(\\frac{ae}{m} - ah + ec\\right) = 1 - \\frac{mh}{e} + \\frac{mc}{a}\n$$\nLet $x = N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K$. The equation is $\\frac{1-2x}{1-x} = 1 - \\frac{mh}{e} + \\frac{mc}{a}$.\nLet $C = 1 - \\frac{mh}{e} + \\frac{mc}{a}$. Then $1-2x = C(1-x) = C-Cx$. This gives $1-C = x(2-C)$, so:\n$$\nx = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{K} = \\frac{1-C}{2-C} = \\frac{mh/e - mc/a}{1+mh/e-mc/a} = \\frac{m(ah-ce)/ae}{1+m(ah-ce)/ae} = \\frac{m(ah-ce)}{ae+m(ah-ce)}\n$$\nFor a biologically meaningful (positive) $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, we must have $ah-ce  0$.\n\nNow we find $r_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ using the equilibrium relations. From the prey nullcline:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{m P_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{e N_{\\mathrm{crit}}(1-N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K)}\n$$\nWe express $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ using the predator nullcline: $P_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{1}{c}(aN_{\\mathrm{crit}}(e/m-h)-1)$.\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{m}{e c N_{\\mathrm{crit}}(1-N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K)} \\left[ aN_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\left(\\frac{e}{m}-h\\right) - 1\\right] = \\frac{m}{ec(1-N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K)} \\left[ a\\left(\\frac{e}{m}-h\\right) - \\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{crit}}} \\right]\n$$\nWe have expressions for $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K$ and $1-N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K$:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{K} = \\frac{m(ah-ce)}{ae+m(ah-ce)}, \\qquad 1-\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{K} = \\frac{ae}{ae+m(ah-ce)}\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{crit}}} = \\frac{ae+m(ah-ce)}{K m(ah-ce)}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $r_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{m}{ec \\frac{ae}{ae+m(ah-ce)}} \\left[ \\frac{a(e-mh)}{m} - \\frac{ae+m(ah-ce)}{K m(ah-ce)} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{m(ae+m(ah-ce))}{ace^2} \\left[ \\frac{a(e-mh)K(ah-ce) - (ae+m(ah-ce))}{Km(ah-ce)} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{ae+m(ah-ce)}{ace^2 K (ah-ce)} \\left[ aK(ah-ce)(e-mh) - (ae+m(ah-ce)) \\right]\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the critical growth rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{ae+m(ah-ce)}{ace^2K(ah-ce)} \\left[ aK(ah-ce)(e-mh) - ae - m(ah-ce) \\right]}\n$$", "id": "2510894"}]}
