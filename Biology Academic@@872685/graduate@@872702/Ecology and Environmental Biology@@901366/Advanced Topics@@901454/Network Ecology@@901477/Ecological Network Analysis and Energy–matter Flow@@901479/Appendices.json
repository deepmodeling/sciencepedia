A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe analysis is based on the principle of mass conservation for each compartment. The rate of change of the stock of nitrogen in a compartment, $\\dot{X}_i$, is equal to the sum of all inflows minus the sum of all outflows.\n\nThe general mass balance equation for compartment $i$ is:\n$$ \\dot{X}_i = (\\text{Total Inflow to } i) - (\\text{Total Outflow from } i) $$\nTotal inflow consists of external inputs ($z_i$) and internal flows from other compartments ($\\sum_{j \\neq i} f_{ji}$). Total outflow consists of external outputs ($y_i$) and internal flows to other compartments ($\\sum_{j \\neq i} f_{ij}$).\nThus, the equation for the net accumulation rate for compartment $i$ is:\n$$ \\dot{X}_i = \\left( z_i + \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{3} f_{ji} \\right) - \\left( y_i + \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{3} f_{ij} \\right) $$\n\nWe apply this equation to each of the three compartments.\n\nFor compartment $i=1$ (Primary Producer):\nThe inflows are the external input $z_1$ and the internal flow from compartment $3$, $f_{31}$. The outflows are the external output $y_1$ and the internal flows to compartments $2$ and $3$, $f_{12}$ and $f_{13}$.\n$$ \\dot{X}_1 = (z_1 + f_{31}) - (y_1 + f_{12} + f_{13}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\dot{X}_1 = (5 + 15) - (18 + 40 + 20) = 20 - 78 = -58 $$\n\nFor compartment $i=2$ (Consumer):\nThe inflows are the external input $z_2$ and the internal flows from compartments $1$ and $3$, $f_{12}$ and $f_{32}$. The outflows are the external output $y_2$ and the internal flow to compartment $3$, $f_{23}$. The flows $f_{21}$ and $z_2$ are given as $0$.\n$$ \\dot{X}_2 = (z_2 + f_{12} + f_{32}) - (y_2 + f_{23}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\dot{X}_2 = (0 + 40 + 8) - (20 + 25) = 48 - 45 = 3 $$\n\nFor compartment $i=3$ (Detritus):\nThe inflows are the external input $z_3$ and the internal flows from compartments $1$ and $2$, $f_{13}$ and $f_{23}$. The outflows are the external output $y_3$ and the internal flows to compartments $1$ and $2$, $f_{31}$ and $f_{32}$.\n$$ \\dot{X}_3 = (z_3 + f_{13} + f_{23}) - (y_3 + f_{31} + f_{32}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\dot{X}_3 = (10 + 20 + 25) - (12 + 15 + 8) = 55 - 35 = 20 $$\n\nA compartment is at steady state if its net accumulation rate is zero ($\\dot{X}_i = 0$). Here, $\\dot{X}_1 = -58$, $\\dot{X}_2 = 3$, and $\\dot{X}_3 = 20$. As none of these values are zero, no single compartment is at steady state.\n\nThe system as a whole is at steady state if the sum of all external inputs equals the sum of all external outputs, which implies the net accumulation rate of the whole system is zero ($\\sum_{i} \\dot{X}_i = 0$).\nTotal external input: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} z_i = 5 + 0 + 10 = 15$.\nTotal external output: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} y_i = 18 + 20 + 12 = 50$.\nSince the total external input ($15$) does not equal the total external output ($50$), the system is not at steady state. This is confirmed by summing the compartment-level accumulation rates:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\dot{X}_i = \\dot{X}_1 + \\dot{X}_2 + \\dot{X}_3 = -58 + 3 + 20 = -35 $$\nThis non-zero sum, which must equal $\\sum z_i - \\sum y_i = 15 - 50 = -35$, demonstrates that the system as a whole is losing nitrogen at a rate of $35$ g N m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem requires the net accumulation rates for each compartment, reported as the row vector $(\\dot{X}_1, \\dot{X}_2, \\dot{X}_3)$.\nThe calculated values are:\n$\\dot{X}_1 = -58$ g N m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$\n$\\dot{X}_2 = 3$ g N m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$\n$\\dot{X}_3 = 20$ g N m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$\n\nThe result is the vector $(-58, 3, 20)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-58 & 3 & 20\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2483621"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of mass balance, we can construct dynamic models to describe how ecosystems change over time.
