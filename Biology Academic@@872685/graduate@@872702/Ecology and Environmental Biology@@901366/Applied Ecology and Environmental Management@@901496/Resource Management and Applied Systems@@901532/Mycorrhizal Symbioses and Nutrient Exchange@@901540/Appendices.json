Assume that transport across the hyphal plasma membrane is catalyzed by a saturable transporter that follows the standard enzyme–substrate mass-action scheme with a quasi–steady-state complex and a conserved transporter pool, yielding an area-specific uptake rate that depends on the external phosphate concentration and two kinetic parameters: a maximum area-specific uptake capacity and a half-saturation concentration. The hypha has radius $r$, and the external phosphate concentration in the soil solution far from the hyphal surface is $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$.

It is a well-posed problem in quantitative biology, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The physical parameters are realistic for microbial systems. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity are found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the derivation of the area-specific uptake rate from the provided reaction scheme. The transporter protein is denoted by $E$, the substrate (phosphate) by $S$, and the transporter-substrate complex by $ES$. The elementary reaction steps with their associated rate constants are:\n$$ E + S \\xrightarrow{k_1} ES $$\n$$ ES \\xrightarrow{k_{-1}} E + S $$\n$$ ES \\xrightarrow{k_2} E + P $$\nwhere $P$ represents the transported phosphate. The net rate of formation of the $ES$ complex is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_2[ES] = k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe problem states the quasi-steady-state assumption for the complex $ES$, which implies that its concentration changes much more slowly than the concentrations of the substrate and product. We set its rate of change to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0 $$\nThis yields:\n$$ k_1 [E][S] \\approx (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe total concentration of transporter, $[E]_T$, is conserved:\n$$ [E]_T = [E] + [ES] \\implies [E] = [E]_T - [ES] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$ k_1 ([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 [E]_T [S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\n$$ k_1 [E]_T [S] = [ES] (k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2) $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_T [S]}{k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2} = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$. Substituting this definition:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe uptake rate, or velocity $V$, is the rate of product formation, which is proportional to the concentration of the complex: $V = k_2 [ES]$.\n$$ V = \\frac{k_2 [E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe maximum velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the transporter is saturated with substrate ($[S] \\to \\infty$), meaning $[ES] \\to [E]_T$. Thus, $V_{\\max} = k_2 [E]_T$.\nThis yields the familiar Michaelis-Menten equation. In this problem, the velocity $V$ is an area-specific uptake rate, which we denote $J_A$. The substrate concentration $[S]$ is the external concentration at the hyphal surface, which is given as $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ due to the assumption of negligible diffusion limitation. The maximum uptake capacity is given as $V_{\\max}$. The equation for the area-specific uptake rate is therefore:\n$$ J_A = \\frac{V_{\\max} C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}} $$\nThis completes the requested derivation of the kinetic form.\n\nNext, we express the uptake rate per unit hyphal length, denoted $J_L$. This is the product of the area-specific uptake rate $J_A$ and the surface area per unit length, $A_L$. For a cylinder of radius $r$, the surface area is $2\\pi r L$ for a length $L$. The area per unit length is $A_L = 2\\pi r$.\n$$ J_L = J_A \\cdot A_L = \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max} C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}} \\right) (2\\pi r) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n-   $r = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $V_{\\max} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $K_{m} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe units for $K_m$ and $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ are the same, so the ratio $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}$ is dimensionless:\n$$ \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}} = \\frac{0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{0.4}{2.4} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nSubstituting the values into the expression for $J_L$:\n$$ J_L = (2\\pi) (2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\left( \\frac{(1.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} \\right) $$\n$$ J_L = (5\\pi \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\left( (1.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ J_L = \\frac{5 \\pi \\times 1.6}{6} \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ J_L = \\frac{8 \\pi}{6} \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in femtomoles per second per meter ($ \\mathrm{fmol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} $). We use the conversion $1 \\ \\mathrm{fmol} = 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{mol}$.\n$$ J_L = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\ \\mathrm{fmol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ J_L \\approx 4.18879... \\ \\mathrm{fmol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, the result is $4.19 \\ \\mathrm{fmol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we address the interpretation of the Michaelis constant $K_m$. In the limit where the external concentration is much lower than the half-saturation concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\ll K_m$, the denominator of the uptake rate equation simplifies: $K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\approx K_m$. The area-specific uptake rate becomes approximately linear with respect to the substrate concentration:\n$$ J_A \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max} C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m} = \\left(\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}\\right) C_{\\mathrm{bulk}} $$\nThe term $\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}$ represents the initial slope of the uptake curve and is called the specific affinity or catalytic efficiency of the transporter for the substrate at low concentrations. It quantifies the transporter's ability to scavenge substrate from a dilute solution. To maximize uptake in a nutrient-poor environment, an organism must possess transporters with a high value of $\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}$. Since $K_m$ is in the denominator of this efficiency term, a smaller $K_m$ value signifies a higher affinity of the transporter for its substrate. This allows for efficient substrate capture even at very low ambient concentrations, which is a critical adaptation for organisms like fungi living in oligotrophic soil environments.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.19}\n$$", "id": "2511492"}, {"introduction": "Once a nutrient is taken up, it must be biochemically assimilated into the organism's metabolism, a process with significant energetic costs.

We begin by isolating the term containing $s^{\\ast}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\n(1 - s^{\\ast})(\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R) = \\alpha + \\beta P_R - k P_R + k \\theta P_R\n$$\nNext, we divide both sides by the term $(\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R)$, which is guaranteed to be positive since $\\alpha > 0$ and all other parameters are non-negative.\n$$\n1 - s^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta P_R - k P_R + k \\theta P_R}{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R}\n$$\nSolving for $s^{\\ast}$ yields:\n$$\ns^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta P_R - k P_R + k \\theta P_R}{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we combine the terms on the right-hand side under a common denominator:\n$$\ns^{\\ast} = \\frac{(\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R) - (\\alpha + \\beta P_R - k P_R + k \\theta P_R)}{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R}\n$$\nWe then expand the numerator and collect like terms. The $\\alpha$ terms cancel out:\n$$\ns^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R - \\alpha - \\beta P_R + k P_R - k \\theta P_R}{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R}\n$$\n$$\ns^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta \\theta P_R - \\beta P_R + k P_R - k \\theta P_R}{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R}\n$$\nFactoring common terms in the numerator, specifically $P_R$ and $(k-\\beta)$ and $(1-\\theta)$, provides a more compact form.\nFirst, factoring $P_R$:\n$$\ns^{\\ast} = \\frac{P_R(\\beta \\theta - \\beta + k - k \\theta)}{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R}\n$$\nThen, factoring within the parenthesis:\n$$\ns^{\\ast} = \\frac{P_R(k(1 - \\theta) - \\beta(1 - \\theta))}{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R}\n$$\nThis leads to the final analytical expression for the invasion threshold:\n$$\ns^{\\ast} = \\frac{P_R(k - \\beta)(1 - \\theta)}{\\alpha + \\beta \\theta P_R}\n$$\nThis $s^{\\ast}$ is the minimum sanction strength, $s_{\\min}$, required to prevent invasion. If $s < s^{\\ast}$, the cheater invades ($W_C > W_R$). If $s \\ge s^{\\ast}$, invasion is prevented ($W_C \\le W_R$).\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of $s_{\\min}$ using the given parameters: $\\alpha = 2$, $\\beta = 2$, $k = 3$, $P_R = 1$, and $\\theta = 0.4$. We substitute these values into our derived expression:\n$$\ns_{\\min} = \\frac{(1)(3 - 2)(1 - 0.4)}{2 + (2)(0.4)(1)}\n$$\nWe evaluate the components of the expression:\n- The numerator is $(1)(1)(0.6) = 0.6$.\n- The denominator is $2 + (2)(0.4) = 2 + 0.8 = 2.8$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $s_{\\min}$ is:\n$$\ns_{\\min} = \\frac{0.6}{2.8} = \\frac{6}{28} = \\frac{3}{14}\n$$\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to $4$ significant figures as instructed.\n$$\ns_{\\min} = \\frac{3}{14} \\approx 0.2142857...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.2143$. This is the minimum sanction strength required for the plant to prevent the cheater strain from successfully invading the resident mutualist population.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2143}\n$$", "id": "2511548"}]}
