A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Outgoing Nitrate Concentration $N(T)$**\n\nWe begin with the principle of mass conservation for nitrate concentration, $N$, within the Lagrangian water parcel. The problem states that the only sink for nitrate is phytoplankton assimilation, and other sources are negligible after the parcel's formation. The rate of change of nitrate is therefore equal to the negative of the uptake rate, $U_N(t)$.\n\nThe governing ordinary differential equation for $N(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -U_{N}(t) = -V_{\\max}^{*} B_{N} \\frac{N(t)}{K_{s} + N(t)}\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation.

The time $t$ runs from $0$ to the residence time $T$, and the nitrate concentration $N(t)$ decreases from its initial value $N(0) = N_{0}$ to its final value $N(T)$. The parameters $V_{\\max}^{*}$, $B_{N}$, and $K_{s}$ are constant.\n$$\n\\int_{N_{0}}^{N(T)} \\left(\\frac{K_{s}}{N} + 1\\right) dN = \\int_{0}^{T} -V_{\\max}^{*} B_{N} dt\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n\\left[ K_{s} \\ln(N) + N \\right]_{N_{0}}^{N(T)} = -V_{\\max}^{*} B_{N} [t]_{0}^{T}\n$$\n$$\n(K_{s} \\ln(N(T)) + N(T)) - (K_{s} \\ln(N_{0}) + N_{0}) = -V_{\\max}^{*} B_{N} T\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the final implicit closed-form expression for $N(T)$:\n$$\nK_{s} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(T)}{N_{0}}\\right) + N(T) - N_{0} = -V_{\\max}^{*} B_{N} T\n$$\nThis equation defines the outgoing nitrate concentration $N(T)$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\n**Derivation of Areal New Primary Production $J_{C}$**\n\nNew primary production is the synthesis of organic matter fueled by \"new\" nutrient inputs to the euphotic zone. In this system, the new nutrient is the nitrate supplied by upwelling. The daily areal rate of new production, $J_{C}$, corresponds to the net rate of nitrate consumption within the upwelling system, converted to carbon units.\n\nAssuming the upwelling system is in a steady state, the rate of new production must balance the net flux of new nutrients. The vertical upwelling velocity $w$ represents a volumetric flux per unit horizontal area.\nThe areal flux of new nitrate into the mixed layer is:\n$$\nJ_{N, \\text{supply}} = w N_{0}\n$$\nAfter a residence time $T$, a water parcel is exported offshore with a remaining nitrate concentration of $N(T)$. The areal flux of unused nitrate exported from the system is:\n$$\nJ_{N, \\text{export}} = w N(T)\n$$\nThe net rate of nitrate assimilation per unit area, $J_{N}$, which defines the new production in nitrogen terms, is the difference between the supply and export fluxes:\n$$\nJ_{N} = J_{N, \\text{supply}} - J_{N, \\text{export}} = w N_{0} - w N(T) = w(N_{0} - N(T))\n$$\nTo find the rate of new primary production in terms of carbon fixation, $J_{C}$, we convert from nitrogen using the specified Redfield molar ratio $R_{C:N} = \\frac{106}{16}$:\n$$\nJ_{C} = J_{N} \\cdot R_{C:N} = w(N_{0} - N(T)) \\frac{106}{16}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for $J_C$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of $J_{C}$**\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $w = 5 \\, \\text{m d}^{-1}$\n- $N_{0} = 14 \\, \\text{mmol N m}^{-3}$\n- $K_{s} = 0.5 \\, \\text{mmol N m}^{-3}$\n- $V_{\\max} = 2.0 \\, \\text{d}^{-1}$\n- $\\bar{\\phi} = 0.6$\n- $B_{N} = 0.8 \\, \\text{mmol N m}^{-3}$\n- $T = 10 \\, \\text{d}$\n- $R_{C:N} = 106/16 = 6.625$\n\nFirst, we calculate the light-limited maximum specific uptake rate, $V_{\\max}^{*}$:\n$$\nV_{\\max}^{*} = \\bar{\\phi} V_{\\max} = 0.6 \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{d}^{-1} = 1.2 \\, \\text{d}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we must solve for $N(T)$ using the implicit equation.

It is stated that the euphotic layer nitrate budget is in a statistical steady state, where the supply of new nitrate is balanced by biological uptake. The supply is composed of two vertical fluxes across the base of the euphotic layer: an advective flux, $F_{adv}$, due to wind-driven upwelling, and a diffusive flux, $F_{diff}$, due to turbulent mixing. In situ nitrification and lateral transport are considered negligible. Therefore, the total vertical nitrate flux, $F_{N}$, supplying the euphotic layer is given by:\n$$ F_{N} = F_{adv} + F_{diff} $$\nThis total flux is then converted to carbon production using the Redfield ratio. We will calculate each flux component based on the provided physical parameters.\n\nFirst, we determine the advective flux, $F_{adv}$. The alongshore wind stress, $\\tau$, drives an offshore Ekman transport perpendicular to the coast. The vertically integrated Ekman mass transport per unit length of coastline, $M_{Ek}$, is given by:\n$$ M_{Ek} = \\frac{\\tau}{f} $$\nwhere $f$ is the Coriolis parameter.

This flux is governed by Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$ F_{diff} = -K_z \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial z} $$\nwhere $K_z$ is the vertical eddy diffusivity and $\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial z}$ is the vertical gradient of nitrate concentration. The vertical coordinate $z$ increases upward, so the given negative gradient $\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial z}$ results in a positive (upward) flux. The eddy diffusivity $K_z$ is determined using the Osborn model, a standard turbulence closure that relates $K_z$ to the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate per unit mass, $\\varepsilon$, and the buoyancy frequency, $N_b$:\n$$ K_z = \\Gamma \\frac{\\varepsilon}{N_b^2} $$\nHere, $\\Gamma$ is the mixing efficiency, representing the fraction of turbulent kinetic energy that does work against the stable density stratification.

The problem assumes all supplied nitrate is assimilated into organic carbon according to the Redfield molar ratio $R_{C:N} = \\frac{106}{16}$. The carbon fixation rate, $P_C$, is then:\n$$ P_C\\ [\\mathrm{mmol\\ C\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}] = F_{N}\\ [\\mathrm{mmol\\ N\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}] \\times R_{C:N} $$\nTo obtain the final answer in units of grams of carbon per square meter per day ($\\mathrm{g\\ C\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$), we multiply by the molar mass of carbon, $M_C = 12\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$, and the number of seconds in a day, $S_d = 86400\\ \\mathrm{s\\ d^{-1}}$. We must also include a conversion factor from $\\mathrm{mmol}$ to $\\mathrm{mol}$.\n$$ NPP = P_C \\times \\frac{M_C}{1000\\ \\mathrm{mmol\\ mol^{-1}}} \\times S_d $$\nCombining all expressions into a single equation for $NPP$:\n$$ NPP = \\left( \\frac{\\tau N_{d}}{\\rho f W} - \\Gamma \\frac{\\varepsilon}{N_b^2} \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial z} \\right) \\times R_{C:N} \\times \\frac{M_C S_d}{1000} $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\tau = 0.12\\ \\mathrm{N\\ m^{-2}}$\n$\\rho = 1025\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-3}}$\n$f = 8.3 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$W = 2.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$N_{d} = 12\\ \\mathrm{mmol\\ m^{-3}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial z} = -0.08\\ \\mathrm{mmol\\ m^{-4}}$\n$\\Gamma = 0.20$\n$\\varepsilon = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-3}}$\n$N_b = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$R_{C:N} = \\frac{106}{16} = 6.625$\n$M_C = 12\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$S_d = 86400\\ \\mathrm{s\\ d^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the flux components:\n$$ F_{adv} = \\frac{0.12 \\times 12}{1025 \\times (8.3 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{4})} = \\frac{1.44}{1701.5} \\approx 8.4631 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mmol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\n$$ F_{diff} = - (0.20) \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{(1.5 \\times 10^{-3})^2} (-0.08) = 0.20 \\times \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{2.25 \\times 10^{-6}} \\times 0.08 \\approx 1.4222 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mmol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\nTotal nitrate flux:\n$$ F_{N} = (8.4631 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.4222 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx 9.8853 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mmol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\nNow, calculate the final $NPP$:\n$$ NPP = (9.8853 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times \\frac{106}{16} \\times \\frac{12 \\times 86400}{1000} $$\n$$ NPP \\approx (9.8853 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 6.625 \\times 1036.8 \\approx 6.7901\\ \\mathrm{g\\ C\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the final result is $6.79\\ \\mathrm{g\\ C\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6.79}\n$$", "id": "2476351"}]}
