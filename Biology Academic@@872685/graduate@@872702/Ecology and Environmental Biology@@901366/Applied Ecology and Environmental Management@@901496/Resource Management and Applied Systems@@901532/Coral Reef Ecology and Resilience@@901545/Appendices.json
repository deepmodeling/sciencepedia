The problem is valid and can be solved as follows.\n\nFirst, we derive the system of differential equations governing the dynamics of coral cover, $C(t)$, and macroalgal cover, $A(t)$. The rate of change for each population is determined by the balance of growth and loss processes.\n\nFor coral cover, $C(t)$, growth is proportional to the existing coral cover, $C$, the intrinsic rate of recruitment and growth, $r_{C}$, and the effective bare space available, which is defined as $1 - C - \\alpha A$. The loss is due to natural mortality at a rate $m_{C}$ proportional to the existing cover. Combining these processes gives the first differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = r_{C}C(1 - C - \\alpha A) - m_{C}C $$\nThis can be rewritten by factoring out $C$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = C \\left[ r_{C}(1 - C - \\alpha A) - m_{C} \\right] = C \\left( r_{C} - m_{C} - r_{C}C - r_{C}\\alpha A \\right) $$\n\nFor macroalgal cover, $A(t)$, the dynamics are analogous. Growth is proportional to the existing algal cover, $A$, the intrinsic rate of recruitment and growth, $r_{A}$, and the effective bare space available to algae, $1 - A - \\beta C$. Losses occur from both natural mortality at a rate $m_{A}$ and herbivory at a rate $g$. Both loss terms are linear, meaning they are proportional to the algal cover $A$. The total loss rate for algae is thus $(m_{A} + g)A$. The differential equation for macroalgae is:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = r_{A}A(1 - A - \\beta C) - m_{A}A - gA $$\nFactoring out $A$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = A \\left[ r_{A}(1 - A - \\beta C) - (m_{A} + g) \\right] = A \\left( r_{A} - m_{A} - g - r_{A}A - r_{A}\\beta C \\right) $$\nThese two equations constitute the requested Lotka-Volterra competition system with herbivory.\n\nNext, we determine the system's equilibria by setting $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$.

The algae-only equilibrium, where $\\hat{C}=0$ and $\\hat{A}  0$. From the second equation, $r_{A} - m_{A} - g - r_{A}\\hat{A} = 0$, which gives $\\hat{A} = \\frac{r_{A} - m_{A} - g}{r_{A}} = 1 - \\frac{m_{A} + g}{r_{A}}$. This equilibrium, $E_{A}$, is meaningful if $r_{A}  m_{A} + g$.\n4.  The coexistence equilibrium, $E_{CA} = (\\hat{C}^{*}, \\hat{A}^{*})$, where $\\hat{C}^{*}  0$ and $\\hat{A}^{*}  0$.

This involves assessing the stability of $E_{C}$. The local stability of an equilibrium is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at that point. Let $f(C,A) = \\frac{dC}{dt}$ and $h(C,A) = \\frac{dA}{dt}$. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ J(C, A) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial C}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial A} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial C}  \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial A} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r_{C} - m_{C} - 2r_{C}C - r_{C}\\alpha A  -r_{C}\\alpha C \\\\ -r_{A}\\beta A  r_{A} - m_{A} - g - 2r_{A}A - r_{A}\\beta C \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the coral-only equilibrium, $E_{C} = (\\hat{C}_{C}, 0)$, where $\\hat{C}_{C} = 1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}}$.\n$$ J(E_{C}) = \\begin{pmatrix} r_{C} - m_{C} - 2r_{C}(1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}})  -r_{C}\\alpha (1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}}) \\\\ 0  r_{A} - m_{A} - g - r_{A}\\beta (1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ J(E_{C}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -(r_{C} - m_{C})  -\\alpha(r_{C} - m_{C}) \\\\ 0  r_{A} - m_{A} - g - r_{A}\\beta (1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince the Jacobian is an upper triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries:\n$$ \\lambda_{1} = -(r_{C} - m_{C}) $$\n$$ \\lambda_{2} = r_{A} - m_{A} - g - r_{A}\\beta \\left(1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}}\\right) $$\nFor $E_{C}$ to be a biologically meaningful equilibrium, we must have $r_{C}  m_{C}$, which ensures that $\\hat{C}_{C}  0$. This condition also ensures that the first eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{1}$, is negative. Thus, the stability of the coral-only equilibrium depends entirely on the sign of the second eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{2}$.\nThe term $\\lambda_{2}$ represents the initial growth rate of the algal population when it is introduced at a very low density into a system where coral is at its carrying capacity. If $\\lambda_{2}  0$, the algal population will decline, meaning it cannot invade the coral-dominated state. In this case, $E_{C}$ is a stable equilibrium. If $\\lambda_{2}  0$, the algal population will grow from a low density, meaning it can successfully invade. In this case, $E_{C}$ is an unstable equilibrium (specifically, a saddle point).\n\nA transcritical bifurcation occurs when two equilibria collide and exchange stability. In this context, the coral-only equilibrium $E_{C}$ exchanges stability with the coexistence equilibrium $E_{CA}$. This event happens when the stability of $E_{C}$ changes, which occurs precisely when $\\lambda_{2} = 0$. At this point, the coexistence equilibrium $E_{CA}$ emerges from or merges with the boundary equilibrium $E_{C}$ (i.e., $\\hat{A}^{*} = 0$).\n\nThe critical grazing pressure, denoted $g^{\\dagger}$, is the value of $g$ for which this bifurcation occurs. We find it by setting $\\lambda_{2} = 0$:\n$$ r_{A} - m_{A} - g^{\\dagger} - r_{A}\\beta \\left(1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}}\\right) = 0 $$\nSolving for $g^{\\dagger}$ yields the expression:\n$$ g^{\\dagger} = r_{A} - m_{A} - r_{A}\\beta \\left(1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}}\\right) $$\nEcologically, $g^{\\dagger}$ is the minimum grazing pressure required to prevent macroalgae from invading and establishing a persistent population on a reef dominated by corals. If the actual grazing pressure $g$ falls below this critical threshold $g^{\\dagger}$, the coral-dominated state becomes unstable, and the system shifts towards a state of coral-algal coexistence. Conversely, if $g  g^{\\dagger}$, grazing is sufficient to maintain the stability of the coral-dominated state. This critical value thus defines a tipping point for the reef ecosystem's resilience. The units of $g^{\\dagger}$ are inverse time, consistent with the units of the rate parameters $r_{A}$, $m_{A}$, etc. If these parameters are supplied in units of $\\text{year}^{-1}$, then $g^{\\dagger}$ will also be in $\\text{year}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{r_{A} - m_{A} - r_{A} \\beta \\left(1 - \\frac{m_{C}}{r_{C}}\\right)} $$", "id": "2479293"}]}
