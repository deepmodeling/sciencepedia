Here, $r  0$ is the intrinsic growth rate, $K  0$ is the carrying capacity, and $H \\geq 0$ is the constant harvest quota. Let the right-hand side of the equation be denoted by $f(B) = rB - \\frac{r}{K}B^2 - H$.\n\nFirst, we derive the equilibrium biomasses, denoted by $B^{\\ast}$, by solving the equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$. This condition yields a quadratic equation for $B^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nrB^{\\ast}\\left(1 - \\frac{B^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - H = 0\n$$\nRearranging this into standard form, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{K}(B^{\\ast})^2 - rB^{\\ast} + H = 0\n$$\nApplying the quadratic formula to solve for $B^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nB^{\\ast} = \\frac{-(-r) \\pm \\sqrt{(-r)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{r}{K}\\right)H}}{2\\left(\\frac{r}{K}\\right)} = \\frac{r \\pm \\sqrt{r^2 - \\frac{4rH}{K}}}{\\frac{2r}{K}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the two potential equilibrium solutions:\n$$\nB^{\\ast} = \\frac{K}{2r} \\left( r \\pm r \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\right) = \\frac{K}{2} \\left( 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\right)\n$$\nFor these equilibria to be real-valued, the discriminant must be non-negative, which imposes a condition on the harvest quota $H$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{4H}{rK} \\geq 0 \\implies H \\leq \\frac{rK}{4}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that an equilibrium must be biologically feasible, meaning $B^{\\ast} \\geq 0$. Given that $K  0$ and for $H$ in the range $0 \\leq H \\leq \\frac{rK}{4}$, the term under the square root is between $0$ and $1$. Consequently, $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\leq 1$.\nThe two equilibria, which we will denote $B_{+}^{\\ast}$ and $B_{-}^{\\ast}$, are:\n$$\nB_{+}^{\\ast} = \\frac{K}{2} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nB_{-}^{\\ast} = \\frac{K}{2} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\right)\n$$\nFor both solutions, the term in the parentheses is non-negative. Therefore, both $B_{+}^{\\ast}$ and $B_{-}^{\\ast}$ are biologically feasible (i.e., $B^{\\ast} \\geq 0$) for all $H$ such that $0 \\leq H \\leq \\frac{rK}{4}$. If $H  \\frac{rK}{4}$, no real equilibria exist.\n\nNext, we analyze the local stability of these equilibria using linearization. The stability of an equilibrium $B^{\\ast}$ is determined by the sign of the derivative $f'(B) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}B}$ evaluated at $B^{\\ast}$. An equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if $f'(B^{\\ast})  0$ and unstable if $f'(B^{\\ast})  0$. The derivative of $f(B)$ is:\n$$\nf'(B) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}B} \\left( rB - \\frac{r}{K}B^2 - H \\right) = r - \\frac{2r}{K}B\n$$\nWe evaluate this derivative at each equilibrium for $0 \\leq H  \\frac{rK}{4}$.\nFor the larger equilibrium, $B_{+}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nf'(B_{+}^{\\ast}) = r - \\frac{2r}{K} B_{+}^{\\ast} = r - \\frac{2r}{K} \\left[ \\frac{K}{2} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\right) \\right] = r - r \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\right) = -r \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}}\n$$\nSince $r  0$ and the term under the square root is positive for $H  \\frac{rK}{4}$, we have $f'(B_{+}^{\\ast})  0$. Thus, the equilibrium $B_{+}^{\\ast}$ is locally asymptotically stable.\n\nFor the smaller equilibrium, $B_{-}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nf'(B_{-}^{\\ast}) = r - \\frac{2r}{K} B_{-}^{\\ast} = r - \\frac{2r}{K} \\left[ \\frac{K}{2} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\right) \\right] = r - r \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}} \\right) = r \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4H}{rK}}\n$$\nFor $0 \\leq H  \\frac{rK}{4}$, this derivative is positive, $f'(B_{-}^{\\ast})  0$. Thus, the equilibrium $B_{-}^{\\ast}$ is unstable.\n\nFrom this stability analysis, we can state the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of at least one positive, locally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Such an equilibrium, $B_{+}^{\\ast}$, exists and is stable if and only if $0 \\leq H  \\frac{rK}{4}$. The equilibrium $B_{+}^{\\ast}$ is always positive when it exists. For $H=0$, $B_{+}^{\\ast} = K  0$. For $H  0$, $B_{+}^{\\ast} > \\frac{K}{2} > 0$. The condition is therefore $0 \\leq H  \\frac{rK}{4}$. A critical qualitative change in the system's dynamics occurs at the threshold $H_{crit} = \\frac{rK}{4}$. As $H$ increases towards this value, the stable equilibrium $B_{+}^{\\ast}$ and the unstable equilibrium $B_{-}^{\\ast}$ approach each other, coalescing at $B^{\\ast} = \\frac{K}{2}$ when $H = \\frac{rK}{4}$. This event is a saddle-node bifurcation. For any harvest quota $H  \\frac{rK}{4}$, no equilibria exist, and the population biomass $B(t)$ will inevitably decline to zero, as the harvest rate exceeds the population's maximum possible growth rate.\n\nFinally, we determine the supremum quota $H_{\\mathrm{sup}}$. This is defined as the least upper bound of all constant quotas $H$ for which there exists at least one positive, locally asymptotically stable equilibrium. The set of such quotas is the interval $[0, \\frac{rK}{4})$. The supremum of this set is the value at its upper boundary.\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{sup}} = \\sup \\left[ 0, \\frac{rK}{4} \\right) = \\frac{rK}{4}\n$$\nThis value, $H_{\\mathrm{sup}}$, is the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) under a constant-quota harvesting policy. It represents the maximum rate of biomass extraction that the population can sustain indefinitely. This maximum yield corresponds to holding the population at the equilibrium biomass $B^{\\ast} = \\frac{K}{2}$, which is the level that generates the highest natural growth rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{rK}{4}}\n$$", "id": "2506172"}, {"introduction": "While the $MSY$ framework [@problem_id:2506172] identifies a biological optimum, real-world harvesting is driven by economic incentives.

The premises are scientifically grounded, mathematically consistent, and the problem is well-posed. The a priori validation confirms the problem is valid, and a solution may be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the steady-state biomass under open-access conditions, denoted as $B_{\\text{OA}}$. An open-access fishery equilibrium is characterized by two simultaneous conditions:\n$1.$ The biological population is at a steady state, meaning its net rate of change is zero.\n$2.$ The economic profit from the fishery is zero, as free entry and exit of participants (effort) will continue until no supernormal profits can be made.\n\nThe dynamics of the biomass $B$ are given by the logistic growth model with a harvest term $H$:\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = r B \\left(1 - \\frac{B}{K}\\right) - H\n$$\nThe biological steady-state condition is $\\frac{dB}{dt} = 0$, which implies that the harvest rate must equal the natural growth rate of the population:\n$$\nH = r B \\left(1 - \\frac{B}{K}\\right)\n$$\nThe harvest $H$ is also defined by the production function $H = q E B$, where $E$ is the fishing effort and $q$ is the catchability coefficient.\n\nThe second condition is the economic equilibrium under open access, where long-run economic profit $\\pi$ is zero. The profit is given as the difference between total revenue ($p H$) and total cost ($c E$):\n$$\n\\pi = p H - c E\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for harvest $H = q E B$, the profit equation becomes:\n$$\n\\pi = p (q E B) - c E = p q B E - c E\n$$\nSetting the profit to zero for the open-access equilibrium:\n$$\np q B E - c E = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out the effort $E$:\n$$\nE (p q B - c) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we must find an interior solution where effort and harvest are strictly positive. For harvest $H = q E B$ to be positive, both effort $E$ and biomass $B$ must be positive (as $q$ is a positive constant). The condition $E  0$ implies that the other term in the factored equation must be equal to zero for the product to be zero.\n$$\np q B - c = 0\n$$\nThis fundamental equation of the open-access model states that effort will adjust until the biomass is driven down to a level, $B_{\\text{OA}}$, where the revenue generated per unit of effort, $p q B_{\\text{OA}}$, is exactly equal to the cost per unit of effort, $c$. This is the \"bionomic\" equilibrium condition.\n\nSolving this equation for the steady-state biomass $B$, which we denote as $B_{\\text{OA}}$, yields the required expression:\n$$\np q B_{\\text{OA}} = c\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\text{OA}} = \\frac{c}{p q}\n$$\nThis expression is the closed-form solution for the open-access steady-state biomass in terms of the price $p$, the cost of effort $c$, and the catchability coefficient $q$. The units of this expression are tonnes, consistent with the definition of biomass $B$.\n\nThe second part of the question asks whether $B_{\\text{OA}}$ depends on the biological parameters $r$ (intrinsic growth rate) and $K$ (carrying capacity). Upon inspection of the derived expression $B_{\\text{OA}} = \\frac{c}{p q}$, it is unequivocally clear that this expression contains only economic and technological parameters ($p$, $c$, $q$). The biological parameters $r$ and $K$ are absent.\n\nTherefore, under the assumptions of the Gordon-Schaefer model for an open-access fishery, the steady-state biomass level $B_{\\text{OA}}$ is determined entirely by economics and technology and is independent of the biological growth characteristics of the fish stock. The logic is that effort will enter or exit the fishery until the revenues per unit of effort match the costs per unit of effort, a condition which, in this model formulation, depends only on the biomass level and not on how quickly the stock can replenish itself. The biological parameters $r$ and $K$ are not irrelevant to the system as a whole; they determine the sustainable level of effort $E_{\\text{OA}}$ that can be exerted at this specific biomass level $B_{\\text{OA}}$ by satisfying the biological steady-state condition $r B_{\\text{OA}}(1 - B_{\\text{OA}}/K) - q E_{\\text{OA}} B_{\\text{OA}} = 0$.

It requires the comparison of three fundamental harvest control rules under conditions of environmental stochasticity. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all parameters and conditions are specified unambiguously. Therefore, it is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the inherent trade-off between maximizing economic or social benefits from a renewable resource (yield) and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the resource population (conservation). This trade-off is evaluated through a Monte Carlo simulation framework.\n\n**1. Population and Harvest Dynamics Model**\n\nThe population dynamics are described by a discrete-time stochastic Ricker model. The pre-harvest biomass in year $t+1$, denoted $X_{t+1}$, is a function of the post-harvest biomass (escapement) from the previous year, $E_t$:\n$$\nX_{t+1} = E_t \\exp\\left( r \\left( 1 - \\frac{E_t}{K} \\right) + \\varepsilon_t \\right)\n$$\nHere, $r$ represents the intrinsic growth rate of the population, and $K$ is the environmental carrying capacity. The term $\\varepsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-\\sigma^2/2, \\sigma^2)$ introduces environmental stochasticity, representing unpredictable fluctuations in factors affecting recruitment success. The specific parameterization of the normal distribution ensures that the stochastic multiplier $\\exp(\\varepsilon_t)$ has an expected value of $1$, meaning the noise does not introduce a systematic bias into the population's long-term average productivity.\n\nThe escapement $E_t$ is the biomass remaining after harvest $H_t$ is removed from the pre-harvest stock $X_t$, i.e., $E_t = X_t - H_t$. The problem specifies three distinct harvest control rules (HCRs):\n\n- **Constant Quota (Index $0$)**: $H_t = \\min\\{q, X_t\\}$. A fixed amount $q$ is targeted for harvest each year, but the harvest cannot exceed the available biomass. This rule is simple to implement but can lead to over-exploitation and collapse if the stock size $X_t$ falls below the quota $q$ for extended periods.\n\n- **Constant Exploitation Fraction (Index $1$)**: $H_t = u X_t$. A fixed proportion $u$ of the pre-harvest biomass is harvested. This rule is responsive to changes in stock size but may not provide sufficient protection at very low biomass levels, as harvest declines but does not cease.\n\n- **Constant Escapement (Index $2$)**: $H_t = \\max\\{0, X_t - S\\}$. The harvest is the surplus biomass above a predefined escapement target $S$. This rule is inherently conservative, as it prioritizes leaving a fixed biomass $E_t = S$ (when $X_t  S$) for reproduction, protecting the stock at low abundance.\n\n**2. Simulation and Performance Evaluation**\n\nTo compare these HCRs, we employ a Monte Carlo simulation. For each parameter set, we simulate $M$ independent population trajectories over $T$ years. To ensure a fair comparison, all three HCRs are subjected to the same sequence of environmental shocks ($\\varepsilon_t$) for each replicate trajectory. This is achieved using the common random numbers technique. An initial burn-in period of $B$ years is discarded to allow the system to reach a statistical steady state, ensuring that the performance metrics are not biased by the initial condition $X_0$.\n\nThe performance of each HCR is judged by two metrics calculated over the evaluation window from year $B$ to $T-1$:\n\n1.  **Mean Yield ($\\bar{Y}$)**: This metric quantifies the average annual harvest, representing the economic output of the fishery. It is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{M(T-B)} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\sum_{t=B}^{T-1} H_t^{(m)}\n    $$\n2.  **Quasi-Extinction Probability ($p_{\\mathrm{qe}}$)**: This metric quantifies the conservation risk. It is the proportion of simulated trajectories where the biomass $X_t$ falls below a critical threshold $x_{\\mathrm{th}}$ at least once during the evaluation period.\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathrm{qe}} = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\mathbb{I}\\left\\{ \\min_{t \\in \\{B,\\dots,T-1\\}} X_t^{(m)}  x_{\\mathrm{th}} \\right\\}\n    $$\n\n**3. Decision Algorithm for Policy Selection**\n\nThe optimal policy is selected based on a lexicographical decision rule that prioritizes safety over yield.\n\n1.  **Identify Safe Policies**: First, we identify the subset of policies for which the risk of quasi-extinction does not exceed a specified tolerance level $\\alpha$. A policy $i$ is considered \"safe\" if its $p_{\\mathrm{qe}}^{(i)} \\le \\alpha$.\n\n2.  **Select from Safe Policies**: If one or more safe policies exist, we select the one that provides the highest mean yield, $\\bar{Y}$. Any ties in yield are broken by choosing the policy with the smaller index ($0, 1,$ or $2$).\n\n3.  **Select from Unsafe Policies**: If no policy meets the safety criterion (i.e., $p_{\\mathrm{qe}}^{(i)}  \\alpha$ for all $i$), the objective shifts to minimizing risk. We select the policy with the lowest quasi-extinction probability, $p_{\\mathrm{qe}}$. Ties are broken first by selecting the policy with the higher mean yield, $\\bar{Y}$, and then by the smaller policy index.\n\n**4. Computational Implementation**\n\nThe solution is implemented as a Python script. For each test case:\n1.  A pseudo-random number generator is initialized with a fixed seed for reproducibility.\n2.  A matrix of $T \\times M$ environmental noise values ($\\varepsilon_t$) is generated once.\n3.  For each of the three policies, a simulation is run for $T$ years across $M$ replicates. The biomass $X_t$ and harvest $H_t$ are stored at each time step.\n4.  After the simulations, the performance metrics $\\bar{Y}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{qe}}$ are calculated for each policy using the trajectory data from the evaluation window.\n5.  The structured decision algorithm is applied to the calculated metrics to determine the winning policy index.\n6.  This process is repeated for all four test cases, and the resulting indices are collected and formatted for the final output.
