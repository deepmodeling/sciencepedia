The problem is scientifically grounded in the established methodology of ecological footprint analysis, using standard definitions for global hectares, equivalence factors, and yield factors.

The assumptions of additivity and homogeneity are explicitly stated to properly constrain the problem. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression that maps a physical area in hectares to global hectares (gha) for a given land-use class $\\ell$ in a region $r$.\nLet $A_{r,\\ell}$ be the physical area in hectares (ha).\nThe equivalence factor, $eqf_{\\ell}$, is a dimensionless scaling factor that converts the area of a specific land-use type $\\ell$ with its world-average productivity into a biologically productive equivalent area with world-average productivity across all land types.\nThe yield factor, $yf_{r,\\ell}$, is another dimensionless scaling factor that accounts for the difference between the local productivity of a land type in region $r$ and the world-average productivity of that same land type.\n\nThe ecological footprint, $EF_{r,\\ell}$, in global hectares, is a measure of this productivity-weighted area. To calculate it, we must multiply the physical area by both scaling factors. The product $yf_{r,\\ell} \\times eqf_{\\ell}$ represents the total conversion factor from a physical hectare of land type $\\ell$ in region $r$ to global hectares.\nThus, the derived expression is:\n$$EF_{r,\\ell} = A_{r,\\ell} \\times yf_{r,\\ell} \\times eqf_{\\ell}$$\nwhere $A_{r,\\ell}$ is in units of hectares, and $EF_{r,\\ell}$ is in units of global hectares.\n\nThe second task is to apply this formula to compute the total ecological footprint for the two specified land-use classes in region $r$. We are given the physical areas in kilohectares (kha), which must first be converted to hectares (ha) using the provided identity $1\\ \\text{kha} = 10^{3}\\ \\text{ha}$.\n\nThe physical areas are:\n$A_{r,\\text{forest}} = 500\\ \\text{kha} = 500 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{ha} = 5 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{ha}$\n$A_{r,\\text{cropland}} = 200\\ \\text{kha} = 200 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{ha} = 2 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{ha}$\n\nThe given factors are:\n$eqf_{\\text{forest}} = 1.3$\n$yf_{r,\\text{forest}} = 0.8$\n$eqf_{\\text{cropland}} = 2.4$\n$yf_{r,\\text{cropland}} = 1.2$\n\nNow, we calculate the ecological footprint for each land-use class.\nFor the closed-canopy forest:\n$EF_{r,\\text{forest}} = A_{r,\\text{forest}} \\times yf_{r,\\text{forest}} \\times eqf_{\\text{forest}}$\n$EF_{r,\\text{forest}} = (5 \\times 10^{5}) \\times 0.8 \\times 1.3 = (5 \\times 10^{5}) \\times 1.04 = 5.2 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{gha}$\n\nFor the intensively managed cropland:\n$EF_{r,\\text{cropland}} = A_{r,\\text{cropland}} \\times yf_{r,\\text{cropland}} \\times eqf_{\\text{cropland}}$\n$EF_{r,\\text{cropland}} = (2 \\times 10^{5}) \\times 1.2 \\times 2.4 = (2 \\times 10^{5}) \\times 2.88 = 5.76 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{gha}$\n\nThe problem states that global hectares are additive.

All provided data are self-consistent and scientifically grounded within the established framework of Ecological Footprint Accounting. The definitions are standard for this field of study. Specifically, the provided values for domestic production ($P_w$), imports ($M_w$), and exports ($X_w$) correctly sum to the stated domestic consumption ($C_w$) according to the provided identity: $P_w + M_w - X_w = (7 \\times 10^{5}) + (4 \\times 10^{5}) - (1 \\times 10^{5}) = 10 \\times 10^{5} = 10^{6}\\ \\text{t}$, which matches $C_w$. The problem is well-posed and contains no contradictions. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Ecological Footprint of wheat consumption in units of global hectares (gha). This requires a step-by-step conversion from the mass of consumed wheat to the corresponding bioproductive area, adjusted for productivity differences.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the expression.\n\nThe total mass of wheat consumed by the nation, $C_w$, represents the total demand that must be supplied by cropland. The problem provides this value as $C_w = 10^{6}$ t.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, the bioproductive cropland area required to supply this physical flow is the flow divided by the agronomic yield. Let $A_n$ be this area in national hectares (ha), and let $Y$ be the national wheat yield.\n$$A_n = \\frac{C_w}{Y}$$\nThis area represents the physical extent of cropland, with national average productivity, required to produce the consumed wheat.\n\nNext, this area in national hectares must be converted to an equivalent area in world-average hectares. The yield factor, $yf_r$, is the ratio of the national average yield of a given crop to the world average yield of the same crop. Thus, it scales the national area to a globally comparable area. An area of land in a country with a higher-than-world-average yield ($yf_r > 1$) corresponds to a larger area of world-average-yield land. The area in world-average hectares, $A_w$, is given by:\n$$A_w = A_n \\times yf_r$$\n\nFinally, this area in world-average cropland hectares must be converted to global hectares (gha). A global hectare is a unit representing one hectare of land with world-average bioproductivity across all land types (cropland, forest, pasture, etc.). The equivalence factor, $eqf_{\\text{cropland}}$, converts the area of a specific land type (cropland) with world-average productivity to the universal unit of global hectares. It reflects the productivity of that specific land type relative to the global average of all productive land types. The final Ecological Footprint, $EF_{\\text{cropland}}$, in global hectares is:\n$$EF_{\\text{cropland}} = A_w \\times eqf_{\\text{cropland}}$$\n\nCombining these steps, the complete expression for the cropland footprint for wheat consumption is:\n$$EF_{\\text{cropland}} = \\left( \\frac{C_w}{Y} \\right) \\times yf_r \\times eqf_{\\text{cropland}}$$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nTask 2: Computation of the footprint.\n\nWe now substitute the provided data into the derived expression:\n- $C_w = 10^{6}\\ \\text{t}$\n- $Y = 4\\ \\text{t/ha}$\n- $yf_r = 1.2$\n- $eqf_{\\text{cropland}} = 2.5$\n\n$$EF_{\\text{cropland}} = \\left( \\frac{10^{6} \\text{ t}}{4 \\text{ t/ha}} \\right) \\times 1.2 \\times 2.5$$\n\nFirst, calculate the area in national hectares:\n$$A_n = \\frac{10^{6}}{4}\\ \\text{ha} = 250,000\\ \\text{ha}$$\n\nNext, convert to world-average hectares:\n$$A_w = 250,000\\ \\text{ha} \\times 1.2 = 300,000\\ \\text{world-average ha}$$\n\nFinally, convert to global hectares:\n$$EF_{\\text{cropland}} = 300,000\\ \\text{world-average ha} \\times 2.5 = 750,000\\ \\text{gha}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $750,000$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it in scientific notation as $7.500 \\times 10^5$.\n\nTask 3: Interpretation of the result.\n\nThe computed cropland footprint of $750,000$ global hectares means that the nation's annual consumption of wheat requires an area equivalent to $750,000$ hectares of land with world-average bioproductivity to be set aside exclusively for this purpose.
