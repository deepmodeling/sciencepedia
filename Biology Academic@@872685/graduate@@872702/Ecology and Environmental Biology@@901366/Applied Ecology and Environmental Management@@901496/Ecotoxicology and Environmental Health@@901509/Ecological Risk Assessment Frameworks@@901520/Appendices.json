We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe statistical model for an individual measurement $Y_{g,s,t,q}$ (density in quadrat $q$ at site $s$ of group $g$ at time $t$) is given by:\n$$Y_{g,s,t,q} = \\mu + \\gamma_{g} + \\lambda_{t} + \\theta_{g t} + b_{g,s} + \\varepsilon_{g,s,t,q}$$\nwhere $g \\in \\{\\mathrm{I}, \\mathrm{C}\\}$, $t \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, $s \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, and $q \\in \\{1, \\dots, r\\}$. The random site effects $b_{g,s}$ are distributed as $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\tau_{s}^{2})$, and the residual errors $\\varepsilon_{g,s,t,q}$ are distributed as $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2})$. These random terms are all mutually independent.\n\nThe parameter of interest is the BACI interaction contrast:\n$$\\Delta = \\theta_{\\mathrm{I},1} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{I},0} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{C},1} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{C},0}$$\nThis parameter represents the change in the difference between impacted and control groups from the pre-discharge to the post-discharge period. A negative value for $\\Delta$ indicates an adverse impact.\n\nTo estimate $\\Delta$, we use the corresponding sample means. Let $\\bar{Y}_{g,t}$ be the sample mean density for group $g$ at time $t$, averaged over all $k$ sites and $r$ quadrats per site.\n$$\\bar{Y}_{g,t} = \\frac{1}{k \\cdot r} \\sum_{s=1}^{k} \\sum_{q=1}^{r} Y_{g,s,t,q}$$\nThe natural estimator for $\\Delta$ is:\n$$\\hat{\\Delta} = (\\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{I},1} - \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{I},0}) - (\\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C},1} - \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C},0})$$\nThe expected value of the estimator is:\n$$E[\\hat{\\Delta}] = (E[\\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{I},1}] - E[\\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{I},0}]) - (E[\\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C},1}] - E[\\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C},0}])$$\nThe expected value of a single observation is $E[Y_{g,s,t,q}] = \\mu + \\gamma_{g} + \\lambda_{t} + \\theta_{g t}$. Thus, $E[\\bar{Y}_{g,t}] = \\mu + \\gamma_{g} + \\lambda_{t} + \\theta_{g t}$. Substituting these into the expression for $E[\\hat{\\Delta}]$ yields:\n$$E[\\hat{\\Delta}] = ((\\mu+\\gamma_{\\mathrm{I}}+\\lambda_1+\\theta_{\\mathrm{I}1}) - (\\mu+\\gamma_{\\mathrm{I}}+\\lambda_0+\\theta_{\\mathrm{I}0})) - ((\\mu+\\gamma_{\\mathrm{C}}+\\lambda_1+\\theta_{\\mathrm{C}1}) - (\\mu+\\gamma_{\\mathrm{C}}+\\lambda_0+\\theta_{\\mathrm{C}0}))$$\n$$E[\\hat{\\Delta}] = (\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_0 + \\theta_{\\mathrm{I}1} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{I}0}) - (\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_0 + \\theta_{\\mathrm{C}1} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{C}0}) = \\theta_{\\mathrm{I}1} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{I}0} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{C}1} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{C}0} = \\Delta$$\nThe estimator $\\hat{\\Delta}$ is unbiased.\n\nNext, we derive the variance of $\\hat{\\Delta}$. Let $\\bar{Y}_{g,s,t} = \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{q=1}^r Y_{g,s,t,q}$ be the mean for a specific site. Then $\\bar{Y}_{g,t} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{s=1}^k \\bar{Y}_{g,s,t}$.\n$$\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{I},1} - \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{I},0} - \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C},1} + \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C},0}$$\nDue to independence of observations between control and impact groups, the variance is additive:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{I},1} - \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{I},0}) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C},1} - \\bar{Y}_{\\mathrm{C},0})$$\nLet's compute the variance of the difference for one group, say group $g$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,1} - \\bar{Y}_{g,0}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,1}) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,0}) - 2 \\mathrm{Cov}(\\bar{Y}_{g,1}, \\bar{Y}_{g,0})$$\nThe observations at different sites are independent. The variance of the mean over $k$ sites is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,t}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{s=1}^{k} \\bar{Y}_{g,s,t}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k^2} \\sum_{s=1}^{k} \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,s,t}) = \\frac{1}{k} \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,s,t})$$\nThe variance of a site-period mean $\\bar{Y}_{g,s,t}$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,s,t}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\mu + \\gamma_{g} + \\lambda_{t} + \\theta_{g t} + b_{g,s} + \\frac{1}{r}\\sum_q \\varepsilon_{g,s,t,q}\\right) = \\mathrm{Var}(b_{g,s}) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\sum_q\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{g,s,t,q}) = \\tau_s^2 + \\frac{r\\sigma^2}{r^2} = \\tau_s^2 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{r}$$\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,t}) = \\frac{1}{k} (\\tau_s^2 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{r})$.\n\nThe covariance term arises from the time-invariant site effect $b_{g,s}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(\\bar{Y}_{g,1}, \\bar{Y}_{g,0}) = \\mathrm{Cov}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_s \\bar{Y}_{g,s,1}, \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_s \\bar{Y}_{g,s,0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k^2} \\sum_s \\mathrm{Cov}(\\bar{Y}_{g,s,1}, \\bar{Y}_{g,s,0})$$\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(\\bar{Y}_{g,s,1}, \\bar{Y}_{g,s,0}) = \\mathrm{Cov}(b_{g,s} + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{g,s,1}, b_{g,s} + \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{g,s,0}) = \\mathrm{Var}(b_{g,s}) = \\tau_s^2$$\nThe covariance is therefore $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\bar{Y}_{g,1}, \\bar{Y}_{g,0}) = \\frac{1}{k^2} k \\tau_s^2 = \\frac{\\tau_s^2}{k}$.\n\nCombining these results:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{g,1} - \\bar{Y}_{g,0}) = \\left(\\frac{\\tau_s^2}{k} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{kr}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\tau_s^2}{k} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{kr}\\right) - 2 \\left(\\frac{\\tau_s^2}{k}\\right) = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{kr}$$\nThe variance contribution from the site effects, $\\tau_s^2$, cancels out due to the differencing of before and after measurements at the same sites. This is a key advantage of the BACI design.\nThe total variance for $\\hat{\\Delta}$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{kr} + \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{kr} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{kr}$$\nThe problem posits a test for a decrease in density, which corresponds to $\\Delta  0$. The hypotheses are:\n$$H_0: \\Delta = 0 \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad H_A: \\Delta  0$$\nUnder the large-sample approximation, the test statistic under $H_0$ is:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\hat{\\Delta} - 0}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\Delta}}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2 / (kr)}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$\nWe reject $H_0$ at significance level $\\alpha$ if $Z  z_\\alpha$, where $z_\\alpha$ is the $\\alpha$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. For $\\alpha = 0.05$, $z_{0.05} \\approx -1.64485$.\n\nPower is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true. We want power of at least $1-\\beta = 0.9$ to detect a true effect of $\\Delta = -\\delta$, where $\\delta = 40$.\n$$\\text{Power} = P(\\text{Reject } H_0 | \\Delta = -\\delta) = P\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\Delta}}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/(kr)}}  z_\\alpha \\Big| \\Delta = -\\delta \\right) = 1-\\beta$$\nUnder the alternative hypothesis $\\Delta = -\\delta$, the estimator $\\hat{\\Delta}$ is distributed as $\\mathcal{N}(-\\delta, 4\\sigma^2/(kr))$. We standardize the variable $\\hat{\\Delta}$ under $H_A$:\n$$\\text{Power} = P\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\Delta} - (-\\delta)}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/(kr)}}  \\frac{z_\\alpha \\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/(kr)} - (-\\delta)}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/(kr)}} \\right)$$\n$$\\text{Power} = \\Phi\\left(z_\\alpha + \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/(kr)}}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\nWe require this probability to be at least $1-\\beta = 0.9$. This implies:\n$$z_\\alpha + \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/(kr)}} \\geq z_{1-\\beta}$$\nwhere $z_{1-\\beta}$ is the $(1-\\beta)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. For $1-\\beta = 0.9$, $z_{0.9} \\approx 1.28155$.\n\nRearranging the inequality to solve for $r$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/(kr)}} \\geq z_{1-\\beta} - z_\\alpha$$\n$$\\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{kr}}{2\\sigma} \\geq z_{1-\\beta} - z_\\alpha$$\n$$\\sqrt{r} \\geq \\frac{2\\sigma (z_{1-\\beta} - z_\\alpha)}{\\delta \\sqrt{k}}$$\n$$r \\geq \\left( \\frac{2\\sigma (z_{1-\\beta} - z_\\alpha)}{\\delta \\sqrt{k}} \\right)^2$$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$k = 5$\n$\\sigma^2 = 1600 \\implies \\sigma = \\sqrt{1600} = 40$\n$\\delta = 40$\n$\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_\\alpha \\approx -1.64485$\n$1-\\beta = 0.9 \\implies z_{1-\\beta} \\approx 1.28155$\n\n$$z_{1-\\beta} - z_\\alpha \\approx 1.28155 - (-1.64485) = 2.9264$$\nSubstituting these into the inequality for $r$:\n$$r \\geq \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 40 \\times (2.9264)}{40 \\times \\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2$$\n$$r \\geq \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 2.9264}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{5.8528}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2$$\n$$r \\geq \\frac{5.8528^2}{5} = \\frac{34.25527}{5} \\approx 6.851$$\nSince $r$ must be an integer representing the number of quadrats, we must take the smallest integer value that satisfies this condition. Therefore, we must round up.\n$$r = 7$$\nThe required number of quadrats per site per period is $7$. The given value of $\\tau_s^2 = 900$ is relevant for the overall variance structure but is not needed for the final calculation of $r$ because it cancels out in the BACI contrast.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "2484069"}]}
