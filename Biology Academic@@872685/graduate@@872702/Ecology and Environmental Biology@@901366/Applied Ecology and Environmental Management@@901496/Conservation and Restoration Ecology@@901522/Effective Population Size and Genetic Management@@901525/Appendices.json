Treat the population as hermaphroditic with nonoverlapping generations and assume random mating.

It is a standard problem in population genetics. All necessary parameters are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe effective population size, $N_e$, can be defined based on the rate of increase of inbreeding (the inbreeding effective size) or the variance in allele frequency change (the variance effective size). For an ideal population, these definitions are equivalent. The problem provides the variance definition: in an ideal Wright–Fisher diploid population of size $N_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$, the one-generation variance in the frequency of a neutral allele, $p$, is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta p) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{2N_{\\mathrm{ideal}}} $$\nWe can define the effective size $N_e$ of any population by equating its variance in allele frequency change to this ideal value:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta p)_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{2N_e} $$\nTo find $N_e$, we must derive an expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta p)$ in a population with variable gamete contribution.
