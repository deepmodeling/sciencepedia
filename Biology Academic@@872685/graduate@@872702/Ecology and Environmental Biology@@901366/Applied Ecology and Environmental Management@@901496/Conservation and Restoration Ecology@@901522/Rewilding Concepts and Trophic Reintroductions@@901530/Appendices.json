This practice challenges you to build the classic Holling Type II and Type III functional responses from the ground up, starting from a predator's basic time budget. By comparing the predictions of these two models under a scenario of increasing prey availability, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how predator behaviors like learning or prey-switching can fundamentally alter the dynamics of a food web following a reintroduction [@problem_id:2529170].", "problem": "A rewilding project reintroduces a solitary apex predator into a fenced savanna reserve where medium-sized ungulate prey are present. The management team wants to anticipate how the predator’s per capita predation rate changes if the prey density doubles during the first year following reintroduction. Assume a single predator and a single focal prey, homogeneous mixing, and that the functional response emerges from a time-budget of the predator’s foraging.\n\nUse the following fundamental base and assumptions:\n- The predator alternates between searching and handling, with a constant handling time per prey of $h$.\n- While searching, encounters that lead to successful attacks occur at a rate proportional to prey density $N$ with coefficient $a$.\n- For a saturating response (Type II), treat the encounter coefficient as constant in $N$.\n- For an accelerating-at-low-density response (Type III), assume that attack efficiency increases linearly with $N$ near low density so that the effective encounter coefficient is proportional to $N$.\n\nStarting only from these principles and the definition that the per capita intake rate is the number of prey consumed per predator per unit time, derive the per capita intake rate as a function of $N$ for both the Type II and Type III cases.

The problem is scientifically grounded in established ecological theory and is well-posed. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nLet $T$ be the total time available for foraging. This time is partitioned into time spent searching for prey, $T_s$, and time spent handling prey, $T_h$. The time budget is thus given by the equation:\n$$T = T_s + T_h$$\nThe total number of prey items consumed during this time, $N_e$, is by definition related to the per capita intake rate, $f(N)$, by $N_e = f(N)T$. The total handling time is the product of the number of prey consumed and the handling time per prey item, $h$:\n$$T_h = N_e h = f(N) T h$$\nSubstituting this into the time budget equation allows us to express the search time as:\n$$T = T_s + f(N) T h \\implies T_s = T(1 - f(N)h)$$\nThe number of prey consumed, $N_e$, must also equal the number of successful encounters that occur during the search time, $T_s$. The rate of these encounters per unit of search time, which we denote as the attack rate $\\mathcal{A}(N)$, is a function of the prey density $N$. Thus:\n$$N_e = \\mathcal{A}(N) T_s$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $N_e$, we have:\n$$f(N)T = \\mathcal{A}(N) T_s$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_s$:\n$$f(N)T = \\mathcal{A}(N) T(1 - f(N)h)$$\nAssuming $T > 0$, we can divide by $T$ to obtain a general relationship between the intake rate $f(N)$ and the attack rate $\\mathcal{A}(N)$:\n$$f(N) = \\mathcal{A}(N) (1 - f(N)h) = \\mathcal{A}(N) - \\mathcal{A}(N) f(N) h$$\nSolving for $f(N)$:\n$$f(N) (1 + \\mathcal{A}(N)h) = \\mathcal{A}(N) \\implies f(N) = \\frac{\\mathcal{A}(N)}{1 + h\\mathcal{A}(N)}$$\nWe now apply this general formula to the two specified cases.\n\nFor the Type II functional response, the problem states that successful attacks during search occur at a rate proportional to prey density $N$ with a constant coefficient $a$. This corresponds to an attack rate per unit search time of:\n$$\\mathcal{A}(N) = aN$$\nSubstituting this into the general formula for $f(N)$ yields the Holling Type II functional response:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{II}}(N) = \\frac{aN}{1 + ahN}$$\n\nFor the Type III functional response, the problem states that the effective encounter coefficient is proportional to $N$. In our framework, the attack rate is $\\mathcal{A}(N) = a_{\\mathrm{eff}}(N) \\cdot N$, where $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}(N)$ is the encounter coefficient. The condition is that $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}(N)$ is proportional to $N$, so we write $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}(N) = cN$ for some constant of proportionality $c$. This leads to an attack rate per unit search time with quadratic dependence on $N$:\n$$\\mathcal{A}(N) = cN^2$$\nSubstituting this into the general formula for $f(N)$ yields the Holling Type III functional response:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{III}}(N) = \\frac{cN^2}{1 + chN^2}$$\nThe problem provides a value for the parameter $a$ but not for $c$. To make the two models comparable and the problem well-defined, we must establish a relationship between $c$ and $a$. A logical assumption is to calibrate the Type III model such that at the initial, reference prey density $N_0$, the effective encounter coefficient $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}(N_0)$ is equal to the constant coefficient $a$ from the Type II model.\n$$a_{\\mathrm{eff}}(N_0) = cN_0 = a \\implies c = \\frac{a}{N_0}$$\nThis sets the attack efficiency of the two models to be equivalent at the initial density. Substituting this expression for $c$ into the Type III equation gives:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{III}}(N) = \\frac{(a/N_0)N^2}{1 + (a/N_0)hN^2}$$\nNow we compute the fold-change $F \\equiv \\frac{f(2N_0)}{f(N_0)}$ for both cases.\n\nFor the Type II response:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{II}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{II}}(2N_0)}{f_{\\mathrm{II}}(N_0)} = \\frac{\\frac{a(2N_0)}{1 + ah(2N_0)}} {\\frac{aN_0}{1 + ahN_0}} = \\frac{2aN_0}{1 + 2ahN_0} \\cdot \\frac{1 + ahN_0}{aN_0} = 2 \\frac{1 + ahN_0}{1 + 2ahN_0}$$\n\nFor the Type III response:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{III}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{III}}(2N_0)}{f_{\\mathrm{III}}(N_0)} = \\frac{\\frac{c(2N_0)^2}{1 + ch(2N_0)^2}} {\\frac{c(N_0)^2}{1 + ch(N_0)^2}} = \\frac{4cN_0^2}{1 + 4chN_0^2} \\cdot \\frac{1 + chN_0^2}{cN_0^2} = 4 \\frac{1 + chN_0^2}{1 + 4chN_0^2}$$\nNow, we substitute $c=a/N_0$ into the expression for $F_{\\mathrm{III}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{III}} = 4 \\frac{1 + (a/N_0)hN_0^2}{1 + 4(a/N_0)hN_0^2} = 4 \\frac{1 + ahN_0}{1 + 4ahN_0}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{II}}}{F_{\\mathrm{III}}}$:\n$$R = \\frac{2 \\frac{1 + ahN_0}{1 + 2ahN_0}}{4 \\frac{1 + ahN_0}{1 + 4ahN_0}} = \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1 + ahN_0}{1 + 2ahN_0} \\cdot \\frac{1 + 4ahN_0}{1 + ahN_0}$$\nThe term $(1 + ahN_0)$ cancels out:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1 + 4ahN_0}{1 + 2ahN_0}$$\nThis is the general symbolic expression for the required ratio.

Calculate the proportion:\n    $P = \\frac{510}{1590} = \\frac{17}{53} \\approx 0.3207547...$\n    Rounded to six decimal places, the result is $0.320755$.\n\nThe same procedure is applied to all test cases to generate the final output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the rewilding decomposition problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test suite: each case is (N_pre, v_pre, b_pre, N_post, v_post, b_post)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: (N_pre, v_pre, b_pre, N_post, v_post, b_post)\n        (30, 0.1, 120, 20, 0.25, 110),\n        # Case B\n        (40, 0.2, 100, 25, 0.2, 100),\n        # Case C\n        (30, 0.05, 130, 30, 0.3, 120),\n        # Case D\n        (20, 0.1, 100, 25, 0.05, 95),\n        # Case E\n        (50, 0.1, 150, 40, 0.3, 170),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        n_pre, v_pre, b_pre, n_post, v_post, b_post = case\n\n        # Calculate effective per-capita browsing rates\n        # I = (1 - v) * b\n        i_pre = (1.0 - v_pre) * b_pre\n        i_post = (1.0 - v_post) * b_post\n\n        # Calculate total browsing pressures\n        # B = N * I\n        b_pre_total = n_pre * i_pre\n        b_post_total = n_post * i_post\n\n        # Calculate total reduction in browsing pressure (proportional to total recovery)\n        # delta_B_total = B_pre - B_post\n        delta_b_total = b_pre_total - b_post_total\n\n        # If total recovery is zero or negative, proportion is 0\n        if delta_b_total <= 0:\n            proportion = 0.0\n        else:\n            # Calculate the density-only counterfactual browsing pressure\n            # B_dens = N_post * I_pre\n            b_dens_counterfactual = n_post * i_pre\n\n            # Calculate the behaviorally mediated reduction in browsing pressure\n            # delta_B_behavior = B_dens - B_post\n            delta_b_behavior = b_dens_counterfactual - b_post_total\n\n            # Calculate the proportion of recovery attributable to behavior\n            # P = delta_B_behavior / delta_B_total\n            proportion = delta_b_behavior / delta_b_total\n        \n        # Format the result to six decimal places.\n        results.append(f\"{proportion:.6f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "2529126"}]}
