It explicitly requires conversion, resolving any potential ambiguity. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Percent Loss of hydraulic Conductivity, $PLC$, at two different xylem water potentials, $\\Psi$, using the provided logistic function. The given function is:\n$$\nPLC(\\Psi) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp(a(\\Psi - \\Psi_{50}))}\n$$\nThe parameters are given as $a = 5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$ and the water potential at $50\\%$ loss of conductivity, $\\Psi_{50} = -2\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $PLC$ for a water potential of $\\Psi = -1\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. This value represents a state of mild water stress, as the water potential is less negative (higher) than the critical midpoint $\\Psi_{50}$.\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n$$\nPLC(-1) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp\\big(5 \\cdot (-1 - (-2))\\big)}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential function is simplified:\n$$\n5 \\cdot (-1 + 2) = 5 \\cdot (1) = 5\n$$\nThus, the expression for $PLC(-1)$ becomes:\n$$\nPLC(-1) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp(5)}\n$$\nThis gives the value in percent. As per the problem specifications, we must convert this to a unitless decimal fraction by dividing by $100$:\n$$\nPLC_{\\text{fraction}}(-1) = \\frac{1}{100} \\cdot PLC(-1) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(5)}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nPLC_{\\text{fraction}}(-1) \\approx \\frac{1}{1+148.413159} = \\frac{1}{149.413159} \\approx 0.00669285\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we obtain $0.006693$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the $PLC$ for a water potential of $\\Psi = -3\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. This value represents severe water stress, as the water potential is more negative (lower) than the critical midpoint $\\Psi_{50}$.\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n$$\nPLC(-3) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp\\big(5 \\cdot (-3 - (-2))\\big)}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential function is simplified:\n$$\n5 \\cdot (-3 + 2) = 5 \\cdot (-1) = -5\n$$\nThus, the expression for $PLC(-3)$ becomes:\n$$\nPLC(-3) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp(-5)}\n$$\nConverting this to a unitless decimal fraction by dividing by $100$:\n$$\nPLC_{\\text{fraction}}(-3) = \\frac{1}{100} \\cdot PLC(-3) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-5)}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nPLC_{\\text{fraction}}(-3) \\approx \\frac{1}{1+0.0067379} = \\frac{1}{1.0067379} \\approx 0.993307\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we obtain $0.9933$.\n\nFor the ecological interpretation:\nAt $\\Psi = -1\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, the loss of conductivity is less than $1\\%$. This corresponds to mild drought conditions under which the plant's water transport system remains almost entirely functional. The water potential is well above the threshold for catastrophic failure, $\\Psi_{50}$.\nAt $\\Psi = -3\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, the loss of conductivity is over $99\\%$. This indicates catastrophic hydraulic failure due to widespread xylem cavitation. The water potential is far below the $\\Psi_{50}$ threshold, pushing the plant into a state where it can no longer effectively transport water, leading to wilting and likely death if the stress is not alleviated. The high value of the slope parameter, $a=5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$, signifies a very steep transition from a functional to a non-functional state around the midpoint of $\\Psi_{50} = -2\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, indicating a narrow hydraulic safety margin for this species. A small change in water potential from $-1.5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ to $-2.5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ would cause a rapid shift from low to high levels of embolism.\n\nThe final answer requires the two unitless decimal fractions in a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.006693 & 0.9933 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2468200"}, {"introduction": "To understand adaptation at the organismal level, we must consider the integrated response to environmental challenges.
