The tasks—deriving a known analytical solution and performing a standard sensitivity analysis—are mathematically well-posed and scientifically relevant. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first objective is to find a closed-form expression for the time, $t$, for a population to grow from an initial density $N_0$ to a target density $N_T$. The governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) $$\nThis is a separable ODE. We rearrange the terms to separate variables $N$ and $t$:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)} = r \\, dt \\implies \\frac{K \\, dN}{N(K-N)} = r \\, dt $$\nThe left-hand side is integrated using partial fraction decomposition. We set $\\frac{K}{N(K-N)} = \\frac{A}{N} + \\frac{B}{K-N}$. Multiplying by $N(K-N)$ yields $K = A(K-N) + BN$. Setting $N=0$ gives $K=AK$, so $A=1$. Setting $N=K$ gives $K=BK$, so $B=1$.

The non-trivial solution is found by setting the other factor to zero:\n$$\n1 - \\bar{p}_{C} - (\\hat{\\mu}_{C}+\\hat{\\delta}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\bar{p}_{C}$ gives the equilibrium occupancy of the colonizer:\n$$\n\\bar{p}_{C} = 1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\delta}\n$$\nThus, the colonizer-only equilibrium is $(\\bar{p}_{C}, \\bar{p}_{R}) = (1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\delta}, 0)$. The problem states to assume feasibility, which means we proceed under the condition that $0 < \\bar{p}_{C} < 1$.\n\nNow, we must determine the condition for the resident species ($R$) to invade this colonizer-only equilibrium. The invasion growth rate, which we denote $\\lambda_{R}$, is the per capita growth rate of the resident population when it is infinitesimally rare, evaluated at the colonizer-only equilibrium.\nThe per capita growth rate of the resident is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p_{R}}\\frac{dp_{R}}{dt} = \\hat{c}_{R}(1 - p_{C} - p_{R}) + \\hat{\\gamma}\\,p_{C} - (\\hat{\\mu}_{R}+\\hat{\\delta})\n$$\nWe evaluate this expression at the equilibrium state $(p_{C}, p_{R}) = (\\bar{p}_{C}, 0) = (1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\delta}, 0)$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{R} = \\hat{c}_{R}(1 - \\bar{p}_{C} - 0) + \\hat{\\gamma}\\,\\bar{p}_{C} - (\\hat{\\mu}_{R}+\\hat{\\delta})\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\bar{p}_{C}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{R} = \\hat{c}_{R}(1 - (1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\delta})) + \\hat{\\gamma}(1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\delta}) - (\\hat{\\mu}_{R}+\\hat{\\delta})\n$$\nSimplifying the first term gives:\n$$\n\\lambda_{R} = \\hat{c}_{R}(\\hat{\\mu}_{C} + \\hat{\\delta}) + \\hat{\\gamma}(1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\delta}) - (\\hat{\\mu}_{R}+\\hat{\\delta})\n$$\nThe resident can invade if $\\lambda_{R} > 0$ and cannot if $\\lambda_{R} < 0$. The critical condition for invasion is when the growth rate is exactly zero, $\\lambda_{R} = 0$.\n\nThe final step is to find the critical disturbance rate, $\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}$, that satisfies $\\lambda_{R} = 0$. We set the expression for the invasion growth rate to zero, replacing $\\hat{\\delta}$ with $\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}$:\n$$\n0 = \\hat{c}_{R}(\\hat{\\mu}_{C} + \\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}) + \\hat{\\gamma}(1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}) - (\\hat{\\mu}_{R}+\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star})\n$$\nWe must now solve this linear equation for $\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}$. We expand and collect all terms involving $\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}$:\n$$\n0 = \\hat{c}_{R}\\hat{\\mu}_{C} + \\hat{c}_{R}\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star} + \\hat{\\gamma} - \\hat{\\gamma}\\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\gamma}\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star} - \\hat{\\mu}_{R} - \\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}\n$$\nGroup terms containing $\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}$ on one side and constant terms on the other:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma}\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star} + \\hat{\\delta}^{\\star} - \\hat{c}_{R}\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star} = \\hat{c}_{R}\\hat{\\mu}_{C} + \\hat{\\gamma} - \\hat{\\gamma}\\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\mu}_{R}\n$$\nFactor out $\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}(\\hat{\\gamma} + 1 - \\hat{c}_{R}) = \\hat{c}_{R}\\hat{\\mu}_{C} + \\hat{\\gamma}(1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C}) - \\hat{\\mu}_{R}\n$$\nIsolating $\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star}$ yields the final closed-form expression for the critical disturbance rate:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\hat{c}_{R}\\hat{\\mu}_{C} + \\hat{\\gamma}(1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C}) - \\hat{\\mu}_{R}}{1 + \\hat{\\gamma} - \\hat{c}_{R}}\n$$\nThis expression defines the precise threshold disturbance level. Above this level, the fast colonizer can exclude the superior competitor; below this level, the competitor can successfully invade.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{\\hat{c}_{R}\\hat{\\mu}_{C} + \\hat{\\gamma}(1 - \\hat{\\mu}_{C}) - \\hat{\\mu}_{R}}{1 + \\hat{\\gamma} - \\hat{c}_{R}} } $$", "id": "2526959"}]}
