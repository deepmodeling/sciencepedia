Such a setup is a valid premise for a problem designed to test the application of a model.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe gross rate of CO2 assimilation, denoted as $A$, is determined by the minimum of the potential rates imposed by different biophysical and biochemical constraints. In this problem, we consider limitation by Rubisco activity ($W_c$) and by the rate of electron transport ($W_j$). The gross assimilation rate is thus $A = \\min(W_c, W_j)$. The net assimilation rate is $A_n = A - R_d$. The factor limiting $A$ also limits $A_n$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Rubisco-limited rate of carboxylation, $W_c$. The carboxylation reaction catalyzed by Rubisco follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Oxygen, $O_2$, acts as a competitive inhibitor to carbon dioxide, $CO_2$, at the enzyme's active site. The rate equation for enzyme kinetics with a competitive inhibitor is $v = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{max}}[S]}{[S] + K_m (1 + [I]/K_i)}$, where $[S]$ is the substrate concentration and $[I]$ is the inhibitor concentration. Applying this to Rubisco, the substrate is $CO_2$ at intercellular concentration $C_i$, the inhibitor is $O_2$ at concentration $O$, the maximum velocity is $V_{\\mathrm{cmax}}$, the Michaelis-Menten constant for $CO_2$ is $K_c$, and the constant for $O_2$ is $K_o$. Therefore, the Rubisco-limited potential carboxylation rate is:\n$$W_c = V_{\\mathrm{cmax}} \\frac{C_i}{C_i + K_c \\left(1 + \\frac{O}{K_o}\\right)}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the electron-transport-limited rate of carboxylation, $W_j$. When the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the light-dependent reactions, it is constrained by the rate of electron transport, $J$, which provides ATP and NADPH for the regeneration of RuBP in the Calvin-Benson cycle. The total electron flow supports both carboxylation (rate $v_c$) and the competing oxygenation reaction (rate $v_o$). The standard stoichiometric model requires $4$ electrons for each RuBP molecule that is turned over, whether by carboxylation or oxygenation. Thus, the total electron flux is $J = 4(v_c + v_o)$. The ratio of oxygenation to carboxylation, $\\phi = v_o/v_c$, can be related to the photorespiratory compensation point $\\Gamma^\\ast$. By definition, at $C_i = \\Gamma^\\ast$, the gross rate of carboxylation is half the rate of oxygenation ($v_c = 0.5 v_o$), which results in zero net carbon gain from photosynthesis and photorespiration. The ratio of reaction rates is also determined by competitive kinetics, $\\phi = \\frac{v_o}{v_c} = (\\frac{V_{omax} K_c}{V_{cmax} K_o}) \\frac{O}{C_i}$, and using the definition of $\\Gamma^\\ast$, this simplifies to $\\phi = \\frac{2\\Gamma^\\ast}{C_i}$. Substituting this into the electron flux equation gives $J = 4(v_c + v_c \\frac{2\\Gamma^\\ast}{C_i}) = 4v_c(1 + \\frac{2\\Gamma^\\ast}{C_i})$. Solving for $v_c$ gives the potential carboxylation rate determined by electron transport. Since PAR is saturating, we use the maximum rate $J_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$W_j = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{max}}}{4\\left(1 + \\frac{2\\Gamma^\\ast}{C_i}\\right)} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{max}}}{4} \\frac{C_i}{C_i + 2\\Gamma^\\ast}$$\n\nNow, we compute the values of $W_c$ and $W_j$ using the provided parameters:\n$V_{\\mathrm{cmax}}=60$, $J_{\\mathrm{max}}=120$, $C_i=250$, $\\Gamma^\\ast=40$, $K_c=404$, $K_o=278$, $O=21000$.\n\nCalculation of $W_c$:\n$$W_c = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 404 \\left(1 + \\frac{21000}{278}\\right)}$$\n$$W_c = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 404 \\left(\\frac{278 + 21000}{278}\\right)} = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 404 \\left(\\frac{21278}{278}\\right)}$$\n$$W_c = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + \\frac{8596312}{278}} = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250 \\cdot 278}{250 \\cdot 278 + 8596312}$$\n$$W_c = \\frac{15000 \\cdot 278}{69500 + 8596312} = \\frac{4170000}{8665812} \\approx 0.4812$$\n\nCalculation of $W_j$:\n$$W_j = \\frac{120}{4} \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 2(40)} = 30 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 80} = 30 \\cdot \\frac{250}{330}$$\n$$W_j = 30 \\cdot \\frac{25}{33} = \\frac{750}{33} = \\frac{250}{11} \\approx 22.727$$\n\nComparing the two potential rates:\n$$W_c \\approx 0.4812$$\n$$W_j \\approx 22.727$$\nSince $W_c  W_j$, the gross assimilation rate $A$ is limited by the capacity of Rubisco.\n$$A = \\min(W_c, W_j) = W_c$$\nThe net assimilation rate $A_n$ is therefore also Rubisco-limited.

NPP is defined as the difference between Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Autotrophic Respiration ($R_a$).\n\nFirst, we must formulate the expression for $NPP$ as a function of $L$.\nAccording to the problem, Gross Primary Production, $GPP$, is proportional to the amount of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR). The incident PAR is given as $I_0$. The fraction of light absorbed by the canopy is $1 - \\exp(-k L)$, where $k$ is the light extinction coefficient and $L$ is the Leaf Area Index.\n\nTherefore, the amount of absorbed PAR is $APAR(L) = I_0 (1 - \\exp(-k L))$.\nThe problem states that by a suitable choice of units, the proportionality constant between GPP and APAR is $1$.
