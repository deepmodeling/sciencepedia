This practice explores the critical link between aqueous chemistry and microbial kinetics, focusing on how pH, a master environmental variable, dictates the speciation of ammonia.

Express your final concentration in mg-N L$^{-1}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem as stated is chemically and mathematically well-posed and can be solved from fundamental principles. We will proceed with its analysis.\n\nThe system is governed by two primary relationships: the mass balance for total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and the acid-base equilibrium of the ammonium-ammonia pair.\n\nFirst, we define the total ammonia nitrogen, $C_T$, as the sum of the nitrogen concentrations from the un-ionized ammonia species, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, and the ionized ammonium species, $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$. The problem specifies that concentrations are expressed on a nitrogen basis (e.g., mg-N L$^{-1}$), which implies a $1:1$ stoichiometric relationship. Therefore, the mass balance equation is:\n$$ C_T = [\\mathrm{NH_3}\\text{-N}] + [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}\\text{-N}] $$\nFor simplicity in notation, let $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$ and $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]$ represent these concentrations on a nitrogen basis.\n$$ C_T = [\\mathrm{NH_3}] + [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}] \\quad (1) $$\n\nSecond, we consider the acid dissociation equilibrium for the ammonium ion:\n$$ \\mathrm{NH_4^+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{NH_3} + \\mathrm{H^+} $$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this reaction is defined, assuming ideal behavior where activities are equal to concentrations, as:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[\\mathrm{NH_3}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]} $$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of the ammonium ion in terms of free ammonia:\n$$ [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{NH_3}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a} \\quad (2) $$\n\nTo derive the relationship between the species and $pH$, we substitute equation $(2)$ into the mass balance equation $(1)$:\n$$ C_T = [\\mathrm{NH_3}] + \\frac{[\\mathrm{NH_3}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a} $$\nFactoring out the term $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$ gives:\n$$ C_T = [\\mathrm{NH_3}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a} \\right) $$\n\nThis expression can be formulated in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$ using their fundamental definitions:\n$$ pH = -\\log_{10}[\\mathrm{H^+}] \\implies [\\mathrm{H^+}] = 10^{-pH} $$\n$$ pK_a = -\\log_{10}K_a \\implies K_a = 10^{-pK_a} $$\nThe ratio of concentrations can now be written as:\n$$ \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a} = \\frac{10^{-pH}}{10^{-pK_a}} = 10^{pK_a - pH} $$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $C_T$:\n$$ C_T = [\\mathrm{NH_3}] \\left( 1 + 10^{pK_a - pH} \\right) $$\nFrom this, we can solve for the concentration of free ammonia, $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{NH_3}] = \\frac{C_T}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}} $$\nThe fraction of TAN present as free ammonia, which we shall denote $f_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$, is therefore:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{NH_3}]}{C_T} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}} $$\nThis derived expression demonstrates from first principles how the fraction of free ammonia is controlled by the difference between $pK_a$ and $pH$.\n\nQualitatively, the dual role of $pH$ on ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) activity is now clear. According to Le Châtelier's principle applied to the equilibrium $\\mathrm{NH_4^+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{NH_3} + \\mathrm{H^+}$, an increase in $pH$ corresponds to a decrease in $[\\mathrm{H^+}]$. The equilibrium will shift to the right to counteract this change, resulting in the conversion of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ to $\\mathrm{NH_3}$. This is reflected in the derived formula for $f_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$: as $pH$ increases, the exponent $(pK_a - pH)$ decreases, causing the term $10^{pK_a - pH}$ to decrease, and thus the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ increases. An increase in the concentration of free ammonia, $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$, makes more substrate available to the AMO enzyme, which can enhance the rate of nitrification. However, because high concentrations of free ammonia are inhibitory, a continued increase in $pH$ will eventually raise $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$ above the inhibition threshold, $K_{i,\\mathrm{FA}}$, leading to a decrease in enzyme activity. Therefore, pH exerts a dual control, governing both substrate availability and potential for inhibition.\n\nNow, we will calculate the free ammonia concentration for the given conditions:\nTotal ammonia nitrogen, $C_T = 7.50$ mg-N L$^{-1}$.\nSolution $pH = 8.10$.\nAcid dissociation constant, $pK_a = 9.25$.\n\nUsing the derived formula for $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{NH_3}\\text{-N}] = \\frac{C_T}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}} $$\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$ [\\mathrm{NH_3}\\text{-N}] = \\frac{7.50}{1 + 10^{9.25 - 8.10}} $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{NH_3}\\text{-N}] = \\frac{7.50}{1 + 10^{1.15}} $$\nWe evaluate the denominator:\n$$ 10^{1.15} \\approx 14.125375 $$\n$$ 1 + 14.125375 = 15.125375 $$\nSo, the concentration is:\n$$ [\\mathrm{NH_3}\\text{-N}] = \\frac{7.50}{15.125375} \\approx 0.495856 \\text{ mg-N L}^{-1} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$ [\\mathrm{NH_3}\\text{-N}] = 0.496 \\text{ mg-N L}^{-1} $$\nThis value is below the contextual inhibition constant of $K_{i,\\mathrm{FA}} = 0.80$ mg-N L$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the system operating under conditions where free ammonia serves primarily as a substrate.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.496} $$", "id": "2512618"}, {"introduction": "Just as pH regulates nitrification, oxygen availability is the primary controller of denitrification.
