By applying the Shannon index, $H$, to a hypothetical community with extreme unevenness, we can develop a strong intuition for how this measure quantifies the uncertainty associated with species identity.

From a large, random sample of individuals, the estimated relative abundances are $p=(0.99,\\,0.01)$. Consider the class of diversity functionals on discrete communities that satisfy the following widely accepted requirements: continuity in each $p_i$, symmetry with respect to species labels, expansibility (adding a species with $p_i=0$ leaves the value unchanged), and recursivity (decomposability) under probabilistic partitions of the community. These axioms uniquely specify the functional form up to a positive multiplicative constant and a choice of logarithm base. Adopt the convention that the multiplicative constant equals $1$ and that the logarithm is the natural logarithm $\\ln$.\n\nUsing these premises, do the following:\n\n1. For the given community with $p=(0.99,\\,0.01)$, compute the diversity value $H$.\n2. For a perfectly even community with species richness $S=2$ (that is, $p=(0.5,\\,0.5)$), compute the corresponding diversity value, denoted $H_{\\mathrm{even}}$.\n3.

The axioms listed—continuity, symmetry, expansibility, and recursivity—are the Khinchin axioms (or a closely related set) which uniquely define the Shannon entropy. This is a cornerstone concept and its application as a diversity index is standard practice. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary information. The axioms and conventions uniquely determine the diversity functional to be used. The community compositions are explicitly defined. The tasks are clear and lead to a single, unambiguous numerical result. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity. It is a valid, formalizable problem in quantitative ecology. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe axioms provided uniquely define the functional form for the diversity index as the Shannon entropy, $H$. Given the specified conventions (multiplicative constant of $1$ and the natural logarithm), the formula is:\n$$ H = - \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i) $$\nwhere $S$ is the number of species (species richness) and $p_i$ is the proportional abundance of the $i$-th species.\n\nFirst, we compute the diversity $H$ for the given community with $S=2$ and abundances $p_1=0.99$ and $p_2=0.01$.\n$$ H = - \\left( p_1 \\ln(p_1) + p_2 \\ln(p_2) \\right) $$\n$$ H = - \\left( 0.99 \\ln(0.99) + 0.01 \\ln(0.01) \\right) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can evaluate this expression.\n$$ H \\approx - \\left( 0.99 \\times (-0.0100503) + 0.01 \\times (-4.6051702) \\right) $$\n$$ H \\approx - \\left( -0.0099498 + -0.0460517 \\right) $$\n$$ H \\approx -(-0.0560015) $$\n$$ H \\approx 0.0560015 $$\n\nNext, we compute the diversity $H_{\\mathrm{even}}$ for a perfectly even community with $S=2$.

This ratio is a measure of evenness or equitability, which quantifies how close the diversity of the observed community is to the maximum possible diversity for the same number of species.\n$$ R = \\frac{H}{H_{\\mathrm{even}}} = \\frac{- \\left( 0.99 \\ln(0.99) + 0.01 \\ln(0.01) \\right)}{\\ln(2)} $$\n$$ R \\approx \\frac{0.0560015}{0.6931472} \\approx 0.0807934 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 0.08079 $$\n\nThe numerical values illustrate a key property of the Shannon index. The maximum diversity for $S=2$ is $H_{\\mathrm{even}} = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$. The given community is extremely uneven, resulting in a much lower diversity value of $H \\approx 0.056$. The ratio $R \\approx 0.08079$ indicates that the community's diversity is only about $8.1\\%$ of the theoretical maximum for two species. This reflects the low uncertainty in identifying a randomly sampled individual, as it will almost certainly belong to the dominant species.\n\nHowever, it is instructive to examine the individual contributions of each species to the total diversity. The contribution of a species is given by the term $-p_i \\ln(p_i)$.\nFor the dominant species ($p_1=0.99$): $-0.99 \\ln(0.99) \\approx 0.010$.\nFor the rare species ($p_2=0.01$): $-0.01 \\ln(0.01) \\approx 0.046$.\nIt is a crucial feature of this index that the rare species, with only $1\\%$ abundance, contributes approximately $4.6$ times more to the value of $H$ than the dominant species with $99\\%$ abundance. This is because the function $f(p) = -p \\ln(p)$ peaks at $p = 1/e \\approx 0.368$. Both very rare ($p \\to 0$) and very dominant ($p \\to 1$) species make small contributions, but the index is particularly sensitive to the presence of rare species, as their inclusion prevents the diversity value from collapsing to zero and their contribution is disproportionately large relative to their abundance.

Assume the usual conventions of probability theory and real analysis (limits, continuity) without adopting any ad hoc rule unless it can be justified from those conventions.\n\nEvaluate the following statements about this scenario and select all that are correct.\n\nA. Under the standard entropy-based diversity, explicitly listing species with $p_i=0$ does not change the computed diversity, because the contribution of any such species is defined by continuity to be $0$ via the limit $\\lim_{p\\to 0^+} p\\log p=0$.\n\nB.

The convention $0\\log 0=0$ is arbitrary and destroys continuity: as a species’ abundance decreases to a very small positive number, its contribution should remain nonzero rather than abruptly becoming $0$ at $p=0$, so this convention should not be used if continuity in $\\mathbf{p}$ is desired.\n\nF. After adopting the convention $0\\log 0=0$, the derivative of $f(p)=p\\log p$ at $p=0$ equals $0$, which provides the mathematical justification for the convention.\n\nG. In measure-theoretic terms, entropy is an expectation of the form $\\mathbb{E}[-\\log P(X)]$ under the distribution $P$ on species labels; events of probability $0$ form a $P$-null set and contribute zero to the expectation, which is consistent with defining $0\\log 0=0$.", "solution": "We begin from core definitions and standard analytical facts:\n\n1. A relative abundance vector $\\mathbf{p}=(p_1,\\dots,p_S)$ satisfies $p_i\\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i=1$. The entropy-based diversity of Shannon is $H(\\mathbf{p})=-\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i \\log p_i$, where $\\log$ denotes a logarithm with a fixed base, typically the natural logarithm. The associated Hill effective number of species of order $1$ is ${}^1D=\\exp(H)$ when $\\log$ is the natural logarithm, and more generally ${}^1D=b^{H_b}$ when $\\log_b$ is used.\n\n2. The quadratic concentration (Simpson concentration) is $\\lambda(\\mathbf{p})=\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i^2$. The Gini–Simpson diversity is $1-\\lambda(\\mathbf{p})$, and the inverse-concentration effective number of species (Hill number of order $2$) is ${}^2D=1/\\lambda(\\mathbf{p})$.\n\n3. The behavior at zero is governed by the limit $\\lim_{p\\to 0^+} p\\log p=0$ for any logarithm base $b>1$, since $\\log_b p=(\\ln p)/(\\ln b)$ and $\\lim_{p\\to 0^+} p\\ln p=0$.

Draw a random subsample of $n$ individuals without replacement from the initial collection of $N$ individuals.\n2. Draw a random pair of individuals without replacement from this subsample of size $n$.\n\nThis two-stage process is probabilistically equivalent to a single-stage experiment:\n- Draw a random pair of individuals without replacement directly from the initial collection of $N$ individuals.\n\nThe equivalence holds because every possible pair of individuals from the original sample of $N$ has an equal probability of being selected in the end. The probability of any specific pair $\\{a, b\\}$ from the original collection being the chosen pair is the probability that both $a$ and $b$ are included in the rarefied sample of size $n$, multiplied by the probability of then selecting that specific pair from the $n$ individuals.
