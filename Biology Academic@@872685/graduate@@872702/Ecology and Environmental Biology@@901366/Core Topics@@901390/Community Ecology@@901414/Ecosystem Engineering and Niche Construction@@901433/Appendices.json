Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the selection gradient, $S(z)$, which is defined as the total derivative of the fitness function $w(z,E)$ with respect to the trait $z$, under the condition that the environmental state $E$ is itself a function of the resident trait $z$. We are given the fitness function for a mutant with trait $z$ in an environment $E$:\n$$\nw(z,E) = a z - b z^{2} + c E\n$$\nand the environmental response function, which links the environment to the resident trait value, here also denoted $z$:\n$$\nE(z) = d z\n$$\nThe constants $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real, with the constraint $b > 0$. The assumption of timescale separation in adaptive dynamics implies that when a rare mutant appears, the environment is at a quasi-equilibrium determined by the established resident population.
