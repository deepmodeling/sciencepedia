The solution hinges on the crucial principle of indifference: for an individual to rationally mix strategies, the expected payoffs from each available pure strategy must be identical when played against the equilibrium strategy of the opponent. Completing this derivation from first principles, rather than simply applying a pre-existing formula, is essential for building a deep and flexible understanding of the logic that underpins mixed evolutionarily stable strategies.

It represents a standard a problem in evolutionary game theory. All necessary information is provided. We shall proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the mixed symmetric Nash Equilibrium (NE) of a two-player symmetric game. Let the two pure strategies be $S_1$ and $S_2$. The payoff matrix for the row player is given by\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nA mixed strategy for a player is defined by the probability with which they choose strategy $S_1$. Let this probability be $p \\in [0, 1]$. Consequently, strategy $S_2$ is chosen with probability $1-p$. The strategy can be represented by the vector $(p, 1-p)$.\n\nWe are searching for a symmetric Nash Equilibrium, which is a strategy profile $(\\sigma^*, \\sigma^*)$ where $\\sigma^*$ is a best response to itself. In our context, this means both players adopt the same mixed strategy, defined by a probability $p^*$. We are interested in an interior equilibrium, where $0  p^*  1$.\n\nFor a player to be willing to randomize between their two pure strategies, they must be indifferent between them. That is, the expected payoff for playing $S_1$ must equal the expected payoff for playing $S_2$, given that the opponent is playing the equilibrium strategy $p^*$.\n\nLet $E(S_i, p^*)$ denote the expected payoff for a player using pure strategy $S_i$ against an opponent using the mixed strategy $p^*$.\n\nThe expected payoff of playing $S_1$ against an opponent playing $S_1$ with probability $p^*$ and $S_2$ with probability $1-p^*$ is:\n$$ E(S_1, p^*) = a \\cdot p^* + b \\cdot (1-p^*) $$\n\nThe expected payoff of playing $S_2$ against the same opponent is:\n$$ E(S_2, p^*) = c \\cdot p^* + d \\cdot (1-p^*) $$\n\nThe indifference condition for the mixed strategy NE is $E(S_1, p^*) = E(S_2, p^*)$.\n$$ a p^* + b (1-p^*) = c p^* + d (1-p^*) $$\nWe solve this equation for $p^*$:\n$$ a p^* + b - b p^* = c p^* + d - d p^* $$\n$$ p^* (a - b) + b = p^* (c - d) + d $$\n$$ p^* (a - b - c + d) = d - b $$\nProvided that the coefficient of $p^*$ is non-zero, we can isolate $p^*$:\n$$ p^* = \\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d} $$\n\nThis is the expression for the probability of playing strategy $S_1$ in the mixed symmetric Nash Equilibrium.\n\nNext, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for this equilibrium to be in the interior, meaning $0  p^*  1$. This requires two inequalities to hold simultaneously.\n\nFirst, the condition $p^*  0$:\n$$ \\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d}  0 $$\nThis inequality holds if and only if the numerator, $d-b$, and the denominator, $a-b-c+d$, have the same sign.\n\nSecond, the condition $p^*  1$, which is equivalent to $1 - p^*  0$:\n$$ 1 - p^* = 1 - \\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d} = \\frac{(a-b-c+d) - (d-b)}{a-b-c+d} = \\frac{a-c}{a-b-c+d} $$\nSo, for $p^*  1$, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{a-c}{a-b-c+d}  0 $$\nThis inequality holds if and only if the numerator, $a-c$, and the denominator, $a-b-c+d$, have the same sign.\n\nFor both conditions to be met, the three terms $(d-b)$, $(a-c)$, and $(a-b-c+d)$ must all have the same sign.\nLet us examine the denominator: $a-b-c+d = (a-c) + (d-b)$. It is the sum of the two numerators.\nIf $(a-c)$ and $(d-b)$ have the same sign (and are non-zero), their sum $(a-b-c+d)$ must also have that same sign. Conversely, if the three terms have the same sign, then in particular $(a-c)$ and $(d-b)$ must have the same sign.\nTherefore, the two conditions $p^*  0$ and $p^*  1$ are simultaneously satisfied if and only if $(a-c)$ and $(d-b)$ are non-zero and have the same sign.\n\nThis leads to two distinct cases for the existence of an interior mixed symmetric Nash Equilibrium:\n1.  $a-c  0$ and $d-b  0$. This is equivalent to $a  c$ and $d  b$. In this scenario, both pure strategies are also Nash equilibria, corresponding to a coordination game.\n2.  $a-c  0$ and $d-b  0$. This is equivalent to $a  c$ and $d  b$. In this scenario, neither pure strategy is a Nash equilibrium, corresponding to an anti-coordination game (such as Hawk-Dove).\n\nThe problem requires the mixed equilibrium strategy profile, which in a symmetric game is $(p^*, p^*)$, where each component is the probability that the respective player assigns to strategy $S_1$.\nThe derived probability is $p^* = \\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d}$.\nThe strategy profile is therefore $\\left( \\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d}, \\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d} \\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d}  \\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2490158"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond two-strategy systems, this practice explores the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, a model for intransitive or cyclical dynamics found in many ecological communities.

It presents a standard exercise in evolutionary game theory, providing all necessary definitions, data, and constraints to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution. The terminology, while slightly unconventional in its application to a polymorphic resident state that includes the \"invading\" morph, is rendered unambiguous by the explicit definition of \"invasion fitness\" provided within the problem.

Since this value is negative, the frequency of the Rock morph will decrease from its current value of $0.2$.

Integrating term-by-term with absolute values in the logarithms yields the antiderivative\n$$\nI(x) = \\frac{1}{V} \\ln x - \\frac{1}{V - C} \\ln (1 - x) + \\frac{C}{V (V - C)} \\ln \\lvert V - C x \\rvert.\n$$\nThus, for $|x_0 - x^\\star|  \\epsilon$,\n$$\n\\frac{w}{2} T_\\epsilon(x_0; V, C, w) = I\\!\\left(x_{\\text{target}}\\right) - I(x_0),\n\\quad \\text{so} \\quad\nT_\\epsilon(x_0; V, C, w) = \\frac{2}{w} \\left[ I\\!\\left(x_{\\text{target}}\\right) - I(x_0) \\right].\n$$\nThis expression is finite for any $x_0, x_{\\text{target}} \\in (0,1)$ with $x_{\\text{target}} \\ne x^\\star$ and $x_0 \\ne x^\\star$, and it correctly diverges as $x_{\\text{target}} \\to x^\\star$, reflecting the asymptotic approach to $x^\\star$.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Given $(V, C, w, \\epsilon, x_0)$, compute $x^\\star = V/C$.\n- If $\\lvert x_0 - x^\\star \\rvert \\le \\epsilon$, return $0$.\n- Else set $x_{\\text{target}} = x^\\star - \\epsilon$ if $x_0  x^\\star$, or $x_{\\text{target}} = x^\\star + \\epsilon$ if $x_0  x^\\star$.\n- Evaluate $I(x)$ using the explicit formula with absolute value inside the logarithm $\\ln \\lvert V - C x \\rvert$.\n- Return $T_\\epsilon = \\dfrac{2}{w} \\big( I(x_{\\text{target}}) - I(x_0) \\big)$.\n- Round to $6$ decimal places.\n\nSanity checks:\n- Scaling in $w$: because $w$ multiplies the right-hand side of the ODE, time rescales as $T_\\epsilon \\propto 1/w$, consistent with the factor $2/w$ in the formula.\n- Symmetry about $x^\\star$ for $(V, C) = (1, 2)$: due to the specific simplification $I(x) = \\ln \\left( \\dfrac{x(1 - x)}{(1 - 2x)^2} \\right)$, initial conditions equidistant from $x^\\star = 1/2$ yield equal times to symmetric neighborhood boundaries.\n\nComputed results for the test suite (rounded to $6$ decimals):\n- Case $1$: $(V, C, w, \\epsilon, x_0) = (\\,1,\\,2,\\,0.8,\\,0.05,\\,0.1\\,)$ gives $T_\\epsilon \\approx 12.926210$.\n- Case $2$: $(V, C, w, \\epsilon, x_0) = (\\,1,\\,2,\\,0.8,\\,0.05,\\,0.9\\,)$ gives $T_\\epsilon \\approx 12.926210$.\n- Case $3$: $(V, C, w, \\epsilon, x_0) = (\\,1,\\,2,\\,0.4,\\,0.05,\\,0.1\\,)$ gives $T_\\epsilon \\approx 25.852420$.\n- Case $4$: $(V, C, w, \\epsilon, x_0) = (\\,3,\\,10,\\,1.2,\\,0.02,\\,0.31\\,)$ has $\\lvert x_0 - x^\\star \\rvert = \\lvert 0.31 - 0.3 \\rvert = 0.01 \\le 0.02$, so $T_\\epsilon = 0.000000$.\n- Case $5$: $(V, C, w, \\epsilon, x_0) = (\\,2,\\,5,\\,0.6,\\,0.01,\\,0.0001\\,)$ gives $T_\\epsilon \\approx 23.478306$.\n\nThe program below implements this procedure exactly and prints the five values as a single list on one line, with each value rounded to $6$ decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef time_to_epsilon(V, C, w, eps, x0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the first-hitting time T_epsilon to reach the epsilon-neighborhood\n    of the mixed ESS x* = V/C under the replicator dynamics:\n        dx/dt = (w/2) * x * (1 - x) * (V - C x)\n    using the exact separation-of-variables integral.\n\n    Parameters:\n        V, C, w, eps, x0: floats with 0  V  C, w  0, eps  0, x0 in (0,1)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: T_epsilon rounded later by caller.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compute mixed ESS\n    x_star = V / C\n\n    # If already within epsilon neighborhood, time is zero\n    if abs(x0 - x_star) = eps:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Determine monotone target boundary\n    target = (x_star - eps) if (x0  x_star) else (x_star + eps)\n\n    # Coefficients for the antiderivative I(x)\n    A = 1.0 / V\n    B = 1.0 / (V - C)\n    coef_ln = C / (V * (V - C))  # coefficient of ln|V - C x|\n\n    def I(x):\n        # Ensure domain safety: x in (0,1), avoid endpoints\n        if x = 0.0 or x = 1.0:\n            raise ValueError(\"x must be in (0,1) for the integral to be finite.\")\n        term1 = A * np.log(x)\n        term2 = -B * np.log(1.0 - x)\n        term3 = coef_ln * np.log(abs(V - C * x))\n        return term1 + term2 + term3\n\n    diff = I(target) - I(x0)\n    T = (2.0 / w) * diff\n    # Numerical guard: times should be non-negative\n    return max(T, 0.0)\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple: (V, C, w, epsilon, x0)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 2.0, 0.8, 0.05, 0.1),      # Case 1\n        (1.0, 2.0, 0.8, 0.05, 0.9),      # Case 2\n        (1.0, 2.0, 0.4, 0.05, 0.1),      # Case 3\n        (3.0, 10.0, 1.2, 0.02, 0.31),    # Case 4\n        (2.0, 5.0, 0.6, 0.01, 0.0001),   # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for V, C, w, eps, x0 in test_cases:\n        t = time_to_epsilon(V, C, w, eps, x0)\n        # Round to 6 decimal places as required\n        results.append(f\"{t:.6f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2490176"}]}
