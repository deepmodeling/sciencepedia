Assume a classical parent–offspring conflict framework in which the parent maximizes inclusive fitness $W_P(I) = r B(I) - C(I)$ and the offspring’s preferred provisioning level corresponds to the level that would maximize $W_O(I) = B(I) - C(I)$ if it could unilaterally determine $I$, where $r$ is the diploid parent–offspring relatedness.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides two well-defined, continuous, and twice-differentiable objective functions, $W_P(I)$ and $W_O(I)$, to be maximized over the domain $I \\ge 0$. The structure guarantees that a unique maximum exists for each case.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise mathematical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is self-contained, consistent, and grounded in established scientific and mathematical principles. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe methodology is optimization using differential calculus. We seek to find the values of $I$ that maximize the parent's inclusive fitness, $W_P(I)$, and the offspring's fitness, $W_O(I)$, respectively. These are denoted $I_P$ and $I_O$.\n\nFirst, we determine the parent-preferred investment, $I_P$.\nThe parent's inclusive fitness function is:\n$$W_P(I) = r B(I) - C(I) = \\frac{1}{2} b_0 \\ln(1 + a I) - c I$$\nTo find the maximum, we compute the first derivative with respect to $I$ and set it to zero. This is the first-order condition for an interior optimum.\n$$\\frac{dW_P}{dI} = \\frac{d}{dI} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} b_0 \\ln(1 + a I) - c I \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} b_0 \\frac{a}{1 + a I} - c$$\nSetting the derivative to zero yields:\n$$\\frac{a b_0}{2(1 + a I)} - c = 0$$\n$$\\frac{a b_0}{2c} = 1 + a I$$\n$$a I = \\frac{a b_0}{2c} - 1$$\n$$I_P = \\frac{1}{a} \\left( \\frac{a b_0}{2c} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{b_0}{2c} - \\frac{1}{a}$$\nThis is the candidate for the interior optimum. To confirm it is a maximum, we check the second-order condition. The second derivative must be negative.\n$$\\frac{d^2W_P}{dI^2} = \\frac{d}{dI} \\left( \\frac{a b_0}{2} (1 + a I)^{-1} - c \\right) = -\\frac{a b_0}{2} (1 + a I)^{-2} (a) = -\\frac{a^2 b_0}{2(1 + a I)^2}$$\nGiven that $a > 0$ and $b_0 > 0$, the numerator $a^2 b_0$ is positive. The denominator $2(1+aI)^2$ is also positive for $I \\ge 0$. Therefore, $\\frac{d^2W_P}{dI^2}  0$, which confirms that the critical point is a local maximum.\nThe problem requires an interior optimum, which means $I_P > 0$. The condition for this is:\n$$\\frac{b_0}{2c} - \\frac{1}{a} > 0 \\implies \\frac{b_0}{2c} > \\frac{1}{a} \\implies a b_0 > 2c$$\nIf $a b_0 \\le 2c$, the marginal benefit at $I=0$ is non-positive, and the optimal investment is the corner solution $I_P=0$. The problem asks for the interior optimum, which is the expression derived above under the condition it is positive.\n\nNext, we determine the offspring-preferred investment, $I_O$.\nThe offspring's fitness function is:\n$$W_O(I) = B(I) - C(I) = b_0 \\ln(1 + a I) - c I$$\nNote that the cost $C(I)$ is the cost to the parent, measured as a loss of future offspring (who would be siblings of the focal offspring). In a standard inclusive fitness model based on the theory presented in the main text, the offspring would devalue this cost by its relatedness to those siblings, maximizing a function like $B(I) - r_{os} C(I)$, where $r_{os}$ is typically 0.5. However, the problem explicitly defines the offspring's objective function as $W_O(I) = B(I) - C(I)$. This simplification represents a scenario of maximum conflict, where the offspring's strategy is modeled as if it does not devalue the cost to its potential siblings at all.\nWe find the first derivative with respect to $I$:\n$$\\frac{dW_O}{dI} = \\frac{d}{dI} \\left( b_0 \\ln(1 + a I) - c I \\right) = b_0 \\frac{a}{1 + a I} - c$$\nSetting the derivative to zero for the first-order condition:\n$$\\frac{a b_0}{1 + a I} - c = 0$$\n$$\\frac{a b_0}{c} = 1 + a I$$\n$$a I = \\frac{a b_0}{c} - 1$$\n$$I_O = \\frac{1}{a} \\left( \\frac{a b_0}{c} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{b_0}{c} - \\frac{1}{a}$$\nWe check the second-order condition:\n$$\\frac{d^2W_O}{dI^2} = \\frac{d}{dI} \\left( a b_0 (1 + a I)^{-1} - c \\right) = -a b_0 (1 + a I)^{-2} (a) = -\\frac{a^2 b_0}{(1 + a I)^2}$$\nSince $a > 0$ and $b_0 > 0$, we have $\\frac{d^2W_O}{dI^2}  0$, confirming a local maximum.\nThe condition for an interior optimum, $I_O > 0$, is:\n$$\\frac{b_0}{c} - \\frac{1}{a} > 0 \\implies \\frac{b_0}{c} > \\frac{1}{a} \\implies a b_0 > c$$\nThe problem asks for the closed-form expressions for the positive interior optima. Thus, the expressions for $I_P$ and $I_O$ are valid when the respective conditions ($a b_0 > 2c$ and $a b_0 > c$) are met. The condition for $I_P>0$ is stricter than for $I_O>0$. When an interior optimum exists for the parent, one must also exist for the offspring.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(I_P, I_O)$.\n$$I_P = \\frac{b_0}{2c} - \\frac{1}{a}$$\n$$I_O = \\frac{b_0}{c} - \\frac{1}{a}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{b_0}{2c} - \\frac{1}{a}  \\frac{b_0}{c} - \\frac{1}{a}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2517971"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of optimal investment, this exercise explores how a parent should allocate a fixed budget of care among multiple offspring when their relatedness varies, a common scenario due to extra-pair paternity.

The male’s inclusive fitness return from care invested in nestling $i$ is the product of a genetic relatedness coefficient $r_i$ and a diminishing-returns benefit function $B_i(I_i)$. Assume that the fundamental quantities follow these definitions:\n- Inclusive fitness is the sum across recipients of genetic relatedness times recipient fitness effects.\n- Genetic relatedness of a sire to a nestling equals one-half times the sire’s paternity probability for that nestling.\n- Parental care returns are concave in effort due to diminishing returns.\n\nSuppose mixed paternity yields paternity probabilities $p_1 = 1$, $p_2 = 0.6$, and $p_3 = 0.2$.

It is scientifically sound and internally consistent. We shall therefore proceed to its solution.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the male's total inclusive fitness, $F$, which is the sum of the fitness returns from each of the three nestlings. The fitness return for nestling $i$ is the product of the genetic relatedness, $r_i$, and the benefit function, $B_i(I_i)$. The total inclusive fitness is:\n$$ F(I_1, I_2, I_3) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} r_i B_i(I_i) $$\nThe investment of care time, $I_i$, must be non-negative, $I_i \\ge 0$, and is subject to a total budget constraint:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} I_i = I $$\nGiven the specific forms of the functions and parameters:\n- Paternity probabilities: $p_1 = 1$, $p_2 = 0.6$, $p_3 = 0.2$.\n- Relatedness coefficients: $r_i = \\frac{1}{2} p_i$, so $r_1 = 0.5$, $r_2 = 0.3$, $r_3 = 0.1$.\n- Benefit functions: $B_i(I_i) = s_i \\sqrt{I_i}$.\n- Efficiency multipliers: $s_1 = 1.0$, $s_2 = 0.8$, $s_3 = 1.2$.\n- Total budget: $I = 120$.\n\nThe objective function becomes:\n$$ F(I_1, I_2, I_3) = r_1 s_1 \\sqrt{I_1} + r_2 s_2 \\sqrt{I_2} + r_3 s_3 \\sqrt{I_3} $$\nThis is a problem of maximizing a function subject to an equality constraint and non-negativity constraints. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function, $\\mathcal{L}$, is constructed as:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(I_1, I_2, I_3, \\lambda) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} r_i s_i \\sqrt{I_i} \\right) - \\lambda \\left( \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} I_i \\right) - I \\right) $$\nThe non-negativity constraints $I_i \\ge 0$ must also be considered. The full Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions would be required if a boundary solution ($I_i=0$ for some $i$) were possible. However, the marginal benefit for nestling $i$ is $\\frac{\\partial (r_i B_i)}{\\partial I_i} = \\frac{r_i s_i}{2\\sqrt{I_i}}$. As $I_i \\to 0^+$, this marginal benefit approaches infinity for any nestling with $r_i s_i > 0$. In this problem, all products $r_i s_i$ are positive:\n- $r_1 s_1 = (0.5)(1.0) = 0.5$\n- $r_2 s_2 = (0.3)(0.8) = 0.24$\n- $r_3 s_3 = (0.1)(1.2) = 0.12$\nSince the marginal return is infinite at zero investment, any optimal allocation must have $I_i^{\\ast} > 0$ for all $i$. Thus, the non-negativity constraints are not binding, and we can find the optimum by setting the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to each $I_i$ to zero.\n\nThe first-order conditions for a maximum are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial I_i} = \\frac{r_i s_i}{2\\sqrt{I_i}} - \\lambda = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = I - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} I_i = 0 $$\nFrom the first condition, we find that at the optimum, the marginal inclusive fitness return from investing in each nestling must be equal to a constant, $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\frac{r_i s_i}{2\\sqrt{I_i}} = \\lambda $$\nSolving for $I_i$ yields its value in terms of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\sqrt{I_i} = \\frac{r_i s_i}{2\\lambda} \\implies I_i = \\left(\\frac{r_i s_i}{2\\lambda}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(r_i s_i)^2}{4\\lambda^2} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $I_i$ into the budget constraint to find $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} I_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{(r_i s_i)^2}{4\\lambda^2} = I $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{4\\lambda^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (r_i s_i)^2 = I $$\n$$ 4\\lambda^2 = \\frac{1}{I} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} (r_j s_j)^2 $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $I_i$, we derive the optimal allocation $I_i^{\\ast}$ for each nestling:\n$$ I_i^{\\ast} = \\frac{(r_i s_i)^2}{ \\frac{1}{I} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} (r_j s_j)^2 } = I \\cdot \\frac{(r_i s_i)^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} (r_j s_j)^2} $$\nThis is the general solution. It shows that the optimal investment in nestling $i$ is proportional to the total budget $I$ and to the square of its effective quality, $(r_i s_i)^2$, relative to the sum of squares for all nestlings.\n\nWe now compute the numerical values for the specific mixed-paternity case. First, calculate the squared effective qualities:\n- $(r_1 s_1)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n- $(r_2 s_2)^2 = (0.24)^2 = 0.0576$\n- $(r_3 s_3)^2 = (0.12)^2 = 0.0144$\nThe sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{3} (r_j s_j)^2 = 0.25 + 0.0576 + 0.0144 = 0.322 $$\nWith a total budget of $I=120$ hours, the optimal allocations are:\n$$ I_1^{\\ast} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{0.25}{0.322} \\approx 93.1677 \\text{ hours} $$\n$$ I_2^{\\ast} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{0.0576}{0.322} \\approx 21.4658 \\text{ hours} $$\n$$ I_3^{\\ast} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{0.0144}{0.322} \\approx 5.3665 \\text{ hours} $$\nFinally, we analyze the effect of mixed paternity by comparing this allocation to the hypothetical case of full paternity, where $p_i = 1$ and thus $r_i = 0.5$ for all $i$.\nIn the full paternity scenario, the effective qualities are:\n- $r_1 s_1 = (0.5)(1.0) = 0.5$\n- $r_2 s_2 = (0.5)(0.8) = 0.4$\n- $r_3 s_3 = (0.5)(1.2) = 0.6$\nThe squared effective qualities are:\n- $(r_1 s_1)^2 = 0.25$\n- $(r_2 s_2)^2 = 0.16$\n- $(r_3 s_3)^2 = 0.36$\nThe sum is $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} (r_j s_j)^2 = 0.25 + 0.16 + 0.36 = 0.77$.\nThe optimal allocations under full paternity would be:\n$$ I_{1, \\text{full}}^{\\ast} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{0.25}{0.77} \\approx 38.96 \\text{ hours} $$\n$$ I_{2, \\text{full}}^{\\ast} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{0.16}{0.77} \\approx 24.94 \\text{ hours} $$\n$$ I_{3, \\text{full}}^{\\ast} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{0.36}{0.77} \\approx 56.10 \\text{ hours} $$\nComparing the allocations:\n- Mixed Paternity: $(I_1^{\\ast}, I_2^{\\ast}, I_3^{\\ast}) \\approx (93.17, 21.47, 5.367)$\n- Full Paternity: $(I_{1, \\text{full}}^{\\ast}, I_{2, \\text{full}}^{\\ast}, I_{3, \\text{full}}^{\\ast}) \\approx (38.96, 24.94, 56.10)$\nThe analysis is clear. The uncertainty of paternity for nestlings $2$ and $3$ causes a dramatic reallocation of parental care. Investment in the nestling of certain paternity ($I_1^{\\ast}$) more than doubles, increasing from approximately $39$ hours to $93$ hours. Conversely, investment in the nestlings of uncertain paternity plummets. Investment in nestling $3$ (lowest paternity) decreases by a factor of ten, from $56$ hours to just over $5$ hours. Investment in nestling $2$ (intermediate paternity) also decreases. The male bird concentrates his limited resources on the offspring that provides the highest inclusive fitness return, which is determined by the combined effect of genetic relatedness ($r_i$) and conversion efficiency ($s_i$). Reduced paternity sharply devalues a nestling in the male's fitness calculation, causing a rational shift of investment toward his own genetic issue.\n\nRounding the results for the mixed-paternity case to four significant figures as required:\n$$ I_1^{\\ast} = 93.17 $$\n$$ I_2^{\\ast} = 21.47 $$\n$$ I_3^{\\ast} = 5.366 $$\nThe sum is $93.17 + 21.47 + 5.366 = 120.006$, which is consistent with the total budget $I=120$ within rounding precision.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 93.17  21.47  5.366 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2517949"}, {"introduction": "Parental care often involves making high-stakes decisions with incomplete information.

Because $\\mu_{P} > \\mu_{H}$ and both conditional distributions are normal with equal variances, the likelihood ratio $\\frac{f_{P}(\\tau)}{f_{H}(\\tau)}$ is a strictly increasing function of $\\tau$ (its logarithm is linear in $\\tau$). Consequently, the equation $\\frac{f_{P}(\\tau)}{f_{H}(\\tau)} = \\frac{(1-p)c_{r}}{p c_{a}}$ has a unique solution, establishing uniqueness of the critical point.
