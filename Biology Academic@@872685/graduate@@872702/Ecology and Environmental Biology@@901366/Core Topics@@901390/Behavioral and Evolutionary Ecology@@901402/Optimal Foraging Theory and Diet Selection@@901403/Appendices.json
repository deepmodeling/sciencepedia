On encounter with prey $i$, the forager can either accept it (always successful capture) or reject it. If accepted, prey $i$ yields energetic reward $E_i$ (kilojoules) and requires handling time $h_i$ (minutes), during which no searching occurs. Assume that recognition and decision-making are instantaneous, there is no interference among prey, and the environment is stationary so that rates and rewards are constant. The forager’s objective under Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) is to maximize the long-run average energy intake rate.\n\nStarting from first principles, namely: (i) Poisson encounter processes and their linearity of expectations, and (ii) the renewal-reward logic that the long-run average intake rate equals expected energetic reward per renewal divided by expected time per renewal, derive an expression for the long-run average intake rate of any fixed acceptance set and use it to characterize when adding a prey type to the diet increases the long-run average intake rate. Then apply this characterization (the zero-one rule) to determine the optimal diet when the prey parameters are $(E_A,h_A,\\lambda_A)=(10,1,0.3)$ and $(E_B,h_B,\\lambda_B)=(5,0.6,0.7)$. Here $E_i$ is in kilojoules, $h_i$ is in minutes, and $\\lambda_i$ is in encounters per minute.\n\nCompute the resulting optimal long-run average energy intake rate, denoted $R^{\\ast}$, for the optimal diet implied by your analysis.

Each prey type $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$ is encountered during search as a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_i$ (per minute). Upon encounter, if prey $i$ is accepted, it yields energy $E_i$ (kilojoules) and requires handling time $h_i$ (minutes), during which searching is suspended. Let $a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote the acceptance decision, with $a_i=1$ meaning prey $i$ is always accepted and $a_i=0$ meaning it is always rejected. The aim is to choose $(a_A,a_B)$ to maximize the long-run average energy intake rate.\n\nWe begin from renewal-reward logic. Consider a renewal anchored on one unit of search time. During one unit of search time, the expected number of encounters of type $i$ is $\\lambda_i$ by properties of a Poisson process. If prey $i$ is accepted, the expected energetic reward accrued per unit search time from type $i$ is therefore $\\lambda_i a_i E_i$, and the expected handling time accrued per unit search time from type $i$ is $\\lambda_i a_i h_i$.

You will derive the critical threshold at which the ranking of foraging options can reverse, highlighting the importance of correctly defining the full time-cost component of rate maximization.", "problem": "A central-place forager repeatedly chooses among alternative prey-processing bouts. For option $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, a bout consists of a dedicated foraging time $T_i$ during which an energetic gain $E_i$ is accrued, and an overhead time $T_0$ (e.g., outbound and inbound travel, preparation, or setup) that is identical across options within a decision episode. The long-run energy intake rate when consistently choosing option $i$ is defined as the ratio of energy to total time, namely $E_i/(T_i+T_0)$. In some analyses, the overhead time is treated as negligible and the “within-bout” currency $E_i/T_i$ is used instead.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of rate as energy per unit time and without invoking any pre-derived foraging rules, address the following:\n\n1.

We are given two options, $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, each characterized by an energetic gain $E_i$ and a dedicated foraging time $T_i$. The long-run energy intake rate, which is the correct currency for optimization, is $R_i(T_0) = \\frac{E_i}{T_i + T_0}$. A simplified, \"within-bout\" rate is defined as $r_i = \\frac{E_i}{T_i}$. We must analyze the relationship between the rankings produced by these two metrics.\n\nFirst, we address the case where the overhead time $T_0$ is negligible. The condition $T_0/T_i \\to 0$ is formally interpreted as the limit $T_0 \\to 0^+$. The rate function $R_i(T_0)$ is a rational function of $T_0$. Since the problem implies physically meaningful parameters, we must have $T_i  0$, and therefore the denominator $T_i + T_0$ is never zero for $T_0 \\ge 0$. This ensures that $R_i(T_0)$ is continuous on the domain $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nBy the property of continuity, the limit of $R_i(T_0)$ as $T_0$ approaches $0$ can be evaluated by direct substitution:\n$$ \\lim_{T_0 \\to 0^+} R_i(T_0) = \\frac{E_i}{T_i + 0} = \\frac{E_i}{T_i} = r_i $$\nThe problem states that we must have $E_1/T_1 \\neq E_2/T_2$, which means $r_1 \\neq r_2$. Without loss of generality, let us assume $r_1  r_2$. We wish to show that for sufficiently small positive $T_0$, it is also true that $R_1(T_0)  R_2(T_0)$. To do this, we examine the difference function $\\Delta R(T_0) = R_1(T_0) - R_2(T_0)$. As the difference of two continuous functions, $\\Delta R(T_0)$ is itself continuous for $T_0 \\ge 0$. Its limit as $T_0 \\to 0^+$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{T_0 \\to 0^+} \\Delta R(T_0) = \\lim_{T_0 \\to 0^+} R_1(T_0) - \\lim_{T_0 \\to 0^+} R_2(T_0) = r_1 - r_2 $$\nGiven our assumption $r_1  r_2$, the limit $r_1 - r_2$ is a positive constant. By the definition of a limit and the properties of continuous functions, if a function approaches a positive limit at a point, there must exist a neighborhood around that point where the function itself is positive. Therefore, there exists a value $\\delta  0$ such that for all $T_0 \\in (0, \\delta)$, we have $\\Delta R(T_0)  0$, which implies $R_1(T_0)  R_2(T_0)$. This confirms that for a negligible overhead time, the strict ordering of options based on the long-run rate $R_i$ is identical to the ordering based on the within-bout rate $r_i$.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that this ordering can reverse for a sufficiently large $T_0$ and derive the specific time $T_0^{\\ast}$ at which the rates are equal. Let us examine the behavior of $R_i(T_0)$ as $T_0 \\to \\infty$. We can write $R_i(T_0) = \\frac{E_i}{T_0(1+T_i/T_0)}$. For very large $T_0$, the term $T_i/T_0$ becomes negligible, and the rate is approximated by $R_i(T_0) \\approx \\frac{E_i}{T_0}$. In this regime, a comparison between $R_1(T_0)$ and $R_2(T_0)$ is approximately a comparison between $\\frac{E_1}{T_0}$ and $\\frac{E_2}{T_0}$, which simplifies to a comparison between $E_1$ and $E_2$.\nA reversal of ranking is thus possible if the ordering by $r_i$ is contrary to the ordering by $E_i$. For instance, if $r_1  r_2$ but $E_1  E_2$, then option $1$ is superior for small $T_0$, while option $2$ becomes superior for large $T_0$. Due to the continuity of the rate functions, there must be an intermediate point $T_0^{\\ast}$ where the preferences are equal.\nThis critical overhead time, $T_0^{\\ast}$, is defined by the equality $R_1(T_0^{\\ast}) = R_2(T_0^{\\ast})$. We solve this equation from first principles:\n$$ \\frac{E_1}{T_1 + T_0^{\\ast}} = \\frac{E_2}{T_2 + T_0^{\\ast}} $$\nProvided that the denominators are non-zero, which they are for $T_0^{\\ast} \\ge 0$, we can cross-multiply:\n$$ E_1(T_2 + T_0^{\\ast}) = E_2(T_1 + T_0^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ E_1 T_2 + E_1 T_0^{\\ast} = E_2 T_1 + E_2 T_0^{\\ast} $$\nWe rearrange the equation to isolate $T_0^{\\ast}$:\n$$ E_1 T_2 - E_2 T_1 = E_2 T_0^{\\ast} - E_1 T_0^{\\ast} $$\n$$ E_1 T_2 - E_2 T_1 = T_0^{\\ast} (E_2 - E_1) $$\nAssuming $E_1 \\neq E_2$, we can solve for $T_0^{\\ast}$:\n$$ T_0^{\\ast} = \\frac{E_1 T_2 - E_2 T_1}{E_2 - E_1} $$\nA physically meaningful reversal point requires $T_0^{\\ast}  0$. This condition is met if the numerator and denominator have the same sign. This is equivalent to requiring $(\\frac{E_1}{T_1}  \\frac{E_2}{T_2} \\text{ and } E_1  E_2)$ or $(\\frac{E_1}{T_1}  \\frac{E_2}{T_2} \\text{ and } E_1  E_2)$, which confirms our earlier reasoning that a reversal occurs if and only if the option with the higher within-bout rate has the lower absolute energy gain.\n\nFinally, we apply this formula to the provided numerical case: $E_1=100\\,\\text{kJ}$, $T_1=1\\,\\text{h}$, $E_2=140\\,\\text{kJ}$, and $T_2=2\\,\\text{h}$.\nFirst, we calculate the within-bout rates:\n$$ r_1 = \\frac{E_1}{T_1} = \\frac{100}{1} = 100\\,\\text{kJ/h} $$\n$$ r_2 = \\frac{E_2}{T_2} = \\frac{140}{2} = 70\\,\\text{kJ/h} $$\nWe observe that $r_1  r_2$.\nNext, we compare the total energy gains:\n$$ E_1 = 100\\,\\text{kJ}  E_2 = 140\\,\\text{kJ} $$\nThe condition for rank reversal is met. We can now compute the critical overhead time $T_0^{\\ast}$ using our derived expression.

Current reserves are $R$. Survival to the next period requires that post-foraging reserves satisfy $R + G \\ge c$, where $G$ is the total energetic gain obtained within the window. Encounters are sequential, handling is exclusive (no searching during handling), and the time to the next encounter of any given prey type is exponentially distributed, consistent with a Poisson search process. The predator’s objective is to maximize expected fitness defined as the probability of survival to the next period times the continuation value, and when the state is near the survival threshold (i.e., $R$ is close to $c$), survival dominates the continuation value. The dynamic decision problem can be written with a value function $V(R,t)$ over remaining time $t$, with a terminal condition $V(R,0) = \\mathbf{1}\\{R \\ge c\\}$, where $\\mathbf{1}\\{\\cdot\\}$ is the indicator function.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the predator has just encountered a single prey item of type $L$ (low profitability) with energy content $e_L$ and handling time $h_L$.

A solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\nThe predator's objective is to maximize the probability of survival. The survival condition is $R + G \\ge c$. With $R=9$ and $c=10$, this simplifies to needing a total energy gain $G \\ge c - R = 10 - 9 = 1$. The predator encounters prey $L$ and must decide whether to accept it or reject it and search for prey $H$.\n\n**Decision 1: Accept prey $L$.**\nIf the predator accepts prey $L$, its energy gain is $G = e_L = 2$.\nThe final reserves will be $R + e_L = 9 + 2 = 11$.\nThe survival condition is met, as $11 \\ge 10$.\nThis action is feasible because the handling time $h_L = 2\\,\\mathrm{min}$ is less than or equal to the foraging window $\\tau = 3\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\nTherefore, accepting prey $L$ guarantees survival. The probability of survival is $1$.\n$$P(\\text{Survival} \\,|\\, \\text{Accept } L) = 1$$\n\n**Decision 2: Reject prey $L$ and search for prey $H$.**\nIf the predator rejects $L$, it must find and consume an $H$ prey to survive. Successfully catching an $H$ prey yields a gain of $G = e_H = 5$, which satisfies the survival requirement ($5 \\ge 1$). If no $H$ prey is caught, $G=0$, and the predator does not survive.\nThus, the probability of survival is the probability of successfully finding and handling an $H$ prey within the time window $\\tau$.\nThe total time to find and handle an $H$ prey is $T_{search} + h_H$, where $T_{search}$ is the time to find the prey. This total time cannot exceed the window $\\tau$.\n$$T_{search} + h_H \\le \\tau$$\nThis implies that the prey must be found within a time $T_{search} \\le \\tau - h_H$.\nGiven the parameters, the search must be successful within $\\tau - h_H = 3\\,\\mathrm{min} - 2\\,\\mathrm{min} = 1\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\nThe time to the next encounter, $T_{search}$, is exponentially distributed with rate $\\lambda_H = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. The probability of an encounter within time $t$ is $P(T_{search} \\le t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_H t)$.\nThe probability of survival is therefore:\n$$P(\\text{Survival} \\,|\\, \\text{Reject } L) = P(T_{search} \\le \\tau - h_H) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_H (\\tau - h_H))$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(\\text{Survival} \\,|\\, \\text{Reject } L) = 1 - \\exp(-0.5 \\times (3 - 2)) = 1 - \\exp(-0.5)$$\nUsing the approximation $e^{-0.5} \\approx 0.6065$, we find:\n$$P(\\text{Survival} \\,|\\, \\text{Reject } L) \\approx 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935$$\n\n**Optimal Decision (State-Dependent Model)**\nComparing the survival probabilities:\n-   Accept L: $P(\\text{Survival}) = 1$.\n-   Reject L: $P(\\text{Survival}) \\approx 0.3935$.\nSince $1  0.3935$, the state-dependent model predicts that the predator should **accept** prey $L$.\n\n**Prediction of the Classic Zero-One Rule**\nThe classic model compares the profitability of prey items, defined as the ratio of energy content to handling time, $e_i/h_i$.\n-   Profitability of prey $L$: $\\pi_L = \\frac{e_L}{h_L} = \\frac{2}{2\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{energy/min}$.\n-   Profitability of prey $H$: $\\pi_H = \\frac{e_H}{h_H} = \\frac{5}{2\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{energy/min}$.\nSince $\\pi_L  \\pi_H$, the classic long-term rate-maximizing model would classify prey $L$ as suboptimal. The optimal strategy under this model is to specialize on the more profitable prey $H$, meaning prey $L$ should be **rejected**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe state-dependent model, which prioritizes immediate survival when reserves are low, predicts that the diet breadth should expand to include the less profitable prey $L$. This is because accepting $L$ provides a certain survival outcome, whereas rejecting it in favor of the riskier but more profitable prey $H$ carries a substantial risk of death ($1 - 0.3935 \\approx 0.6065$). The classic model, blind to the predator's state, would always reject $L$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. For these parameters, the state-dependent model prescribes accepting $L$ at $t=0$ because acceptance yields survival with probability $1$ (since $R + e_L = 11 \\ge c$ and $h_L \\le \\tau$), whereas rejecting $L$ and waiting for $H$ yields survival probability $1 - \\exp\\!\\big(-\\lambda_H(\\tau - h_H)\\big) = 1 - \\exp(-0.5 \\times 1) \\approx 0.393  1$. Thus, near the survival threshold, the state-dependent model expands diet breadth to include $L$, while the classic zero–one rule would exclude $L$ because $e_L/h_L = 1  e_H/h_H = 2.5$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the predictions of both models. The calculation for the survival probability when rejecting $L$ is correct: $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_H(\\tau-h_H)) \\approx 0.393$. The comparison of probabilities ($1  0.393$) leads to the correct decision to accept $L$ in the state-dependent model. The analysis of the classic model based on profitabilities ($e_L/h_L=1  e_H/h_H=2.5$) is also correct. The overall conclusion that the state-dependent model expands the diet is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both models reject $L$ because its profitability is lower than that of $H$, and reserves do not alter optimal diet breadth under any optimality principle.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As derived, the state-dependent model prescribes accepting $L$. The claim that reserves do not alter optimal diet breadth is fundamentally false and contradicts the principles of state-dependent foraging theory.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The state-dependent model rejects $L$ here because waiting for $H$ strictly increases expected energy intake and the survival probabilities are equal whenever $\\tau  h_H$.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the state-dependent model accepts, not rejects, $L$. Second, the expected energy intake from waiting for $H$ is $e_H \\times P(\\text{success}) = 5 \\times (1 - e^{-0.5}) \\approx 5 \\times 0.3935 = 1.9675$, which is less than the gain from accepting $L$ ($e_L = 2$). Third, the claim that survival probabilities are equal is false; the survival probability from rejecting $L$ is a function of multiple parameters and is not generally equal to the probability from accepting $L$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. One should reject $L$ because the probability of encountering $H$ in the remaining window is $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_H \\tau) \\approx 0.776$, which is sufficiently high that the safer choice is to wait; therefore, low reserves do not justify accepting lower-profitability prey.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The calculation $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_H \\tau)$ represents the probability of encountering $H$ within the full window $\\tau$, but it fails to account for the time $h_H$ needed for handling. The correct calculation uses the search window $\\tau - h_H$. Furthermore, the conclusion that waiting is \"safer\" is wrong; waiting has a survival probability of $\\approx 0.393$, while accepting has a survival probability of $1$. Accepting is the safer choice. The final claim that low reserves do not justify accepting suboptimal prey is the opposite of the correct theoretical conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2515987"}]}
