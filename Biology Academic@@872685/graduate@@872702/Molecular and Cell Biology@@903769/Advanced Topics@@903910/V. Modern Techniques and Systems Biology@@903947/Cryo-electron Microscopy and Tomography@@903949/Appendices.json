You will (i) choose a pixel size $p$ that satisfies the sampling requirement based on the Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem, and (ii) determine a box size in pixels large enough to contain the particle plus padding that suppresses wrap-around artifacts when applying Fourier-domain band-limiting at spatial frequency $1/d$ using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n\nUse only the following fundamental bases to justify your choices:\n\n- Sampling: The Shannon–Nyquist theorem states that a band-limited signal with maximum spatial frequency $k_{\\max}$ can be represented without aliasing if the sampling frequency $k_{s}$ satisfies $k_{s} \\ge 2 k_{\\max}$. In real-space imaging with pixel size $p$, the sampling frequency is $k_{s} = 1/p$ and the Nyquist frequency is $k_{N} = 1/(2p)$. A real-space resolution $d$ corresponds to a spatial frequency cutoff $k_{\\max} = 1/d$.\n\n- Wrap-around suppression under DFT: The DFT implements circular convolution. If you band-limit in Fourier space with a separable rectangular passband of half-width $k_{\\max}$ along each Cartesian axis (corresponding to a real-space impulse response that is a product of one-dimensional sinc functions), then the main lobe of the real-space kernel extends from the origin to its first zero at a distance that can be computed from the Fourier pair. To avoid overlap of the main lobe with periodic images of the object, require a real-space padding margin equal to at least the distance to the first zero of this kernel on each side of the particle.\n\nAssume the band-limit is an ideal separable rectangular low-pass with cutoff $k_{\\max} = 1/d$ along each axis, and that edge apodization in practice suppresses contributions beyond the first zero sufficiently for this margin criterion to be considered “sufficient” in the sense above.

It is a standard preliminary calculation in the field of cryo-electron microscopy. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the minimum integer box size, in pixels, for imaging a protein particle. This calculation proceeds in two stages: first, the selection of an appropriate pixel size based on the target resolution, and second, the calculation of the total box dimension in real space, accounting for padding, which is then converted to pixels.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the Pixel Size, $p$.\n\nThe Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem provides the fundamental constraint on the pixel size. The theorem states that to unambiguously represent a signal with a maximum spatial frequency $k_{\\max}$, the sampling frequency $k_s$ must satisfy the condition:\n$$k_s \\ge 2 k_{\\max}$$\nThe problem provides the definitions for these quantities in the context of imaging. The target resolution $d$ corresponds to a maximum spatial frequency $k_{\\max} = 1/d$. The sampling is performed with pixels of size $p$, leading to a sampling frequency of $k_s = 1/p$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the sampling theorem yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{p} \\ge \\frac{2}{d}$$\nSolving for the pixel size $p$, we find:\n$$p \\le \\frac{d}{2}$$\nThis establishes an upper bound on the pixel size to avoid aliasing artifacts and achieve the target resolution $d = 3.2\\,\\text{\\AA}$. The problem instructs us to choose the largest possible pixel size that satisfies this condition, thereby minimizing the total number of pixels in the image. This choice corresponds to the equality:\n$$p = \\frac{d}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $d$:\n$$p = \\frac{3.2\\,\\text{\\AA}}{2} = 1.6\\,\\text{\\AA}$$\nThis is the pixel size that will be used for the remainder of the calculation.\n\nPart 2: Determination of the Box Size, $N$.\n\nThe box must be large enough to contain the particle and sufficient padding to mitigate wrap-around artifacts during Fourier processing. These artifacts arise because the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) implicitly assumes the signal is periodic, leading to circular convolution when a filter is applied in Fourier space.\n\nThe problem specifies the padding requirement. Band-limiting is performed using an ideal separable rectangular low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of $k_{\\max} = 1/d$ along each axis. The inverse Fourier transform of such a rectangular function in frequency space is a sinc-like function in real space. For one dimension, the filter is a rectangular pulse of width $2k_{\\max}$. Its inverse Fourier transform, which represents the impulse response or point-spread function (PSF) of the filtering operation, is proportional to $\\text{sinc}(2k_{\\max}x)$, where the normalized sinc function is defined as $\\text{sinc}(u) = \\sin(\\pi u)/(\\pi u)$.\n\nThe first zero of this sinc function (for $x>0$) occurs when its argument is unity:\n$$2k_{\\max}x_{\\text{zero}} = 1$$\nSolving for $x_{\\text{zero}}$ gives the extent of the PSF's main lobe:\n$$x_{\\text{zero}} = \\frac{1}{2k_{\\max}}$$\nSubstituting $k_{\\max} = 1/d$, we find the required padding margin:\n$$\\text{padding margin} = \\frac{1}{2(1/d)} = \\frac{d}{2}$$\nThis padding must be applied to each side of the particle. The total required side length of the box in real space, $L$, is the sum of the particle's diameter, $D$, and the padding on two opposite sides:\n$$L = D + 2 \\times (\\text{padding margin}) = D + 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right) = D + d$$\nUsing the given values $D = 220\\,\\text{\\AA}$ and $d = 3.2\\,\\text{\\AA}$:\n$$L = 220\\,\\text{\\AA} + 3.2\\,\\text{\\AA} = 223.2\\,\\text{\\AA}$$\nThis is the minimum real-space dimension of the box.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n(a) Derivation of the inelastic scattering fraction $p_{\\text{inel}}$\n\nThe Beer–Lambert law describes the attenuation of a beam of particles as it passes through a medium. Let $N(x)$ be the number of electrons that have not undergone an inelastic scattering event after traveling a distance $x$ into the specimen. The rate of change of $N(x)$ with respect to distance $x$ is proportional to $N(x)$ itself:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(x)}{dx} = - \\mu N(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient for inelastic scattering. The inelastic mean free path, $\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}$, is defined as the average distance an electron travels before an inelastic collision, and it is the reciprocal of the attenuation coefficient:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the differential equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}} N(x)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it by separation of variables, integrating from the incident surface ($x=0$) to a depth $t$. Let $N_0$ be the initial number of electrons at $x=0$.\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{dN}{N} = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}} dx\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\n$$\nThe fraction of electrons that have *not* been inelastically scattered (the \"zero-loss\" fraction), which we denote $p_0$, is given by:\n$$\np_0 = \\frac{N(t)}{N_0} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the survival probability. The fraction of electrons that have suffered at least one inelastic scattering event, $p_{\\text{inel}}$, is the complement of the survival probability. This is because any given electron has either been scattered or it has not.\n$$\np_{\\text{inel}} + p_0 = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the expression for $p_{\\text{inel}}$ is:\n$$\np_{\\text{inel}} = 1 - p_0 = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)\n$$\n\n(b) Numerical computation of $p_{\\text{inel}}$\n\nWe are given the values $t = 150$ nm and $\\lambda_{\\text{inel}} = 350$ nm. We substitute these into the derived expression for $p_{\\text{inel}}$. The ratio $t/\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n$$\n\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}} = \\frac{150}{350} = \\frac{15}{35} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nNow, we compute $p_{\\text{inel}}$:\n$$\np_{\\text{inel}} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{7}\\right)\n$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4285714\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{7}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-0.4285714) \\approx 0.651415\n$$\n$$\np_{\\text{inel}} \\approx 1 - 0.651415 = 0.348585\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$\np_{\\text{inel}} \\approx 0.3486\n$$\n\n(c) Influence on SNR and derivation of SNR improvement factor\n\nThe quantity $p_{\\text{inel}}$ represents the fraction of electrons that are inelastically scattered. According to the problem's simplifying assumptions, these electrons contribute to the noise but not to the useful signal, which is carried exclusively by the zero-loss electrons. A higher value of $p_{\\text{inel}}$ means that a larger portion of the incident electron dose is converted into background noise without contributing to image contrast. This directly degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as the signal component (from zero-loss electrons) becomes weaker relative to the total noise (from all detected electrons).\n\nNow, we derive the SNR improvement factor. Let $N_0$ be the total incident electron fluence.\nThe number of zero-loss (signal-carrying) electrons is $N_{ZL}$:\n$$\nN_{ZL} = N_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe signal, $S$, is proportional to the number of signal-carrying electrons. We can state that $S$ is a modulation of $N_{ZL}$. However, for analyzing the basic SNR dependency, we can consider the \"signal strength\" to be proportional to $N_{ZL}$.\nThe noise is assumed to be Poisson shot noise, which is equal to the square root of the number of detected electrons.\n\nCase 1: Unfiltered Image\nAll electrons are detected. The total number of detected electrons is $N_{total, unf} = N_0$.\nThe noise is $\\sigma_{unf} = \\sqrt{N_{total, unf}} = \\sqrt{N_0}$.\nThe SNR is the ratio of signal strength to noise:\n$$\nSNR_{unf} \\propto \\frac{N_{ZL}}{\\sigma_{unf}} = \\frac{N_0 \\exp(-t/\\lambda_{\\text{inel}})}{\\sqrt{N_0}} = \\sqrt{N_0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)\n$$\n\nCase 2: Filtered Image\nAn ideal energy filter removes all inelastically scattered electrons. Only zero-loss electrons are detected.\nThe total number of detected electrons is $N_{total, fil} = N_{ZL} = N_0 \\exp(-t/\\lambda_{\\text{inel}})$.\nThe noise is $\\sigma_{fil} = \\sqrt{N_{total, fil}} = \\sqrt{N_0 \\exp(-t/\\lambda_{\\text{inel}})}$.\nThe signal strength is still proportional to $N_{ZL}$, as the same electrons carry the signal.\nThe SNR is:\n$$\nSNR_{fil} \\propto \\frac{N_{ZL}}{\\sigma_{fil}} = \\frac{N_0 \\exp(-t/\\lambda_{\\text{inel}})}{\\sqrt{N_0 \\exp(-t/\\lambda_{\\text{inel}})}} = \\sqrt{N_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)} = \\sqrt{N_0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{2\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe SNR improvement factor is the ratio of the filtered SNR to the unfiltered SNR:\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{SNR_{fil}}{SNR_{unf}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_0} \\exp(-t/(2\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}))}{\\sqrt{N_0} \\exp(-t/\\lambda_{\\text{inel}})}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{2\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}} - \\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{2\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}} + \\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{2\\lambda_{\\text{inel}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis factor represents the improvement in SNR gained by using an ideal energy filter to remove the noise contribution from inelastically scattered electrons.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3486}\n$$", "id": "2940169"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful strategies in cryo-EM is the computational enforcement of molecular symmetry, which can dramatically increase the effective amount of data and push reconstructions to high resolution.

An analysis of the problem statement and its foundational principles confirms its validity. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Fourier optics and group theory as applied to structural biology, is well-posed, and is presented in an objective, formal manner. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the number of asymmetric units for an object with proper rotational icosahedral symmetry. The problem defines this as the number of distinct regions mapped onto each other by the symmetry operations. In the language of group theory, this corresponds to the order of the point group, which is the total number of symmetry operations in the group. The specified group is the proper rotational icosahedral group, denoted as $I$.\n\nTo find the order of the group $I$, denoted $|I|$, we can apply the orbit-stabilizer theorem. This theorem states that for a group $G$ acting on a set $X$, the size of the group is the product of the size of the orbit of an element $x \\in X$ and the size of the stabilizer subgroup of that same element: $|G| = |\\mathrm{Orb}_G(x)| \\cdot |\\mathrm{Stab}_G(x)|$.\n\nLet the group $I$ act on the set of vertices of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has $V=12$ vertices. The group action is transitive on the set of vertices, meaning any vertex can be transformed into any other vertex by some rotation in the group. Therefore, the size of the orbit of any vertex is the total number of vertices, $|\\mathrm{Orb}_I(\\text{vertex})| = 12$.\n\nNext, we must determine the stabilizer of a single vertex. The stabilizer, $\\mathrm{Stab}_I(\\text{vertex})$, consists of all rotations in $I$ that leave the chosen vertex fixed. For a regular icosahedron, a $5$-fold rotational axis passes through each vertex and its antipodal partner. The rotations about this axis by angles of $2\\pi j/5$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ are elements of the group. These are $5$ distinct rotational operations (including the identity for $j=0$) that fix the vertex. Hence, the size of the stabilizer subgroup is $|\\mathrm{Stab}_I(\\text{vertex})| = 5$.\n\nApplying the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the order of the group $I$ is:\n$$|I| = |\\mathrm{Orb}_I(\\text{vertex})| \\cdot |\\mathrm{Stab}_I(\\text{vertex})| = 12 \\times 5 = 60$$\nThis result can be confirmed by considering the group action on the faces or edges. An icosahedron has $F=20$ triangular faces. A $3$-fold axis passes through the center of each face. The orbit size is $20$ and the stabilizer size is $3$, giving $|I| = 20 \\times 3 = 60$. It also has $E=30$ edges. A $2$-fold axis passes through the midpoint of each edge. The orbit size is $30$ and the stabilizer size is $2$, giving $|I| = 30 \\times 2 = 60$. All calculations are consistent.\nThe number of asymmetric units is therefore $60$.\n\nThe second task is to derive the effective number of independent particle contributions, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k)$, after symmetry averaging. We are given $N$ particle images with a uniform orientation distribution over $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$. According to the central slice theorem, the $2$D Fourier transform of each projection image corresponds to a central slice through the $3$D Fourier transform of the object's Coulomb potential, which we denote $F(\\mathbf{k})$.\n\nThe reconstruction process aims to estimate $F(\\mathbf{k})$ from these $N$ slices. The measured value on a slice contains signal and noise. Let the estimate of the Fourier coefficient at a point $\\mathbf{k}$ from the available data be $\\hat{F}(\\mathbf{k})$. This estimate is an average of measurements from particles whose orientations cause their corresponding central slices to pass through the neighborhood of $\\mathbf{k}$. For a large number of particles $N$ with uniform orientation, the number of samples contributing to this local average is proportional to $N$. The variance of the estimate is inversely proportional to the number of samples, so $\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{F}(\\mathbf{k})] \\propto 1/N$.\n\nThe key step is the enforcement of symmetry. The a priori knowledge that the object has icosahedral symmetry implies that the true Fourier coefficients are identical for all symmetry-related points. For a centrosymmetric object potential in real space, its Fourier transform is real and respects the symmetry, so $F(\\mathbf{k}) = F(g\\mathbf{k})$ for any $g \\in I$.\n\nTherefore, to estimate the value of the Fourier coefficient for a given structural feature, one can average the measurements not only from the neighborhood of $\\mathbf{k}$ but also from the neighborhoods of all points in its orbit, $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\{g\\mathbf{k} \\mid g \\in I\\}$. Let us denote the symmetry-averaged estimate by $\\hat{F}_{\\text{sym}}(\\mathbf{k})$. This estimate is conceptually an average of the estimates from each point in the orbit:\n$$\\hat{F}_{\\text{sym}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbf{k})|} \\sum_{g\\mathbf{k}' \\in \\mathcal{O}(\\mathbf{k})} \\hat{F}(\\mathbf{k}')$$\nThe problem states that we can neglect points $\\mathbf{k}$ lying on symmetry axes, as they constitute a set of measure zero on any Fourier shell. For any generic point $\\mathbf{k}$ not on a symmetry axis, its stabilizer is trivial (contains only the identity element), so the size of its orbit is equal to the order of the group, $|\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbf{k})| = |I| = 60$.\n\nThe noise in the measured Fourier coefficients is independent and identically distributed. Because the particle orientations are independent and uniformly distributed, the sets of particles contributing to measurements at distinct, non-overlapping regions on a Fourier shell are also independent. The regions around the $60$ symmetry-related points $g\\mathbf{k}$ are distinct for a generic $\\mathbf{k}$. Therefore, the estimates $\\hat{F}(g\\mathbf{k})$ for different $g$ can be treated as independent random variables.\n\nLet the variance of an estimate at any single point on the shell be $\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{F}(\\mathbf{k})] = \\sigma^2_{\\text{est}}$. Due to the uniform sampling, this variance is constant across the shell. The variance of the symmetry-averaged estimate is then:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{F}_{\\text{sym}}(\\mathbf{k})] = \\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\frac{1}{|I|} \\sum_{g \\in I} \\hat{F}(g\\mathbf{k})\\right] = \\frac{1}{|I|^2} \\sum_{g \\in I} \\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{F}(g\\mathbf{k})]$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{F}(g\\mathbf{k})] = \\sigma^2_{\\text{est}}$ for all $g \\in I$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{F}_{\\text{sym}}(\\mathbf{k})] = \\frac{1}{|I|^2} \\cdot |I| \\cdot \\sigma^2_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{1}{|I|} \\sigma^2_{\\text{est}}$$\nThe variance of the estimate is reduced by a factor of $|I| = 60$.\n\nThe effective number of particles, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k)$, is defined as the number of particles that would be required to achieve the same variance reduction in a non-symmetrized reconstruction. Since variance is inversely proportional to the number of particles, a reduction in variance by a factor of $|I|$ is equivalent to an increase in the number of particles by the same factor.\nIf $\\mathrm{Var}[\\text{no sym}] \\propto 1/N$ and $\\mathrm{Var}[\\text{with sym}] \\propto 1/N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, then:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[\\text{with sym}]}{\\mathrm{Var}[\\text{no sym}]} = \\frac{N}{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nWe found that $\\mathrm{Var}[\\text{with sym}] = \\frac{1}{|I|} \\mathrm{Var}[\\text{no sym}]$. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{1}{|I|} = \\frac{N}{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nThis yields $N_{\\mathrm{eff}} = |I| \\cdot N$. Since $|I|=60$, we have $N_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 60N$. The result is independent of the spatial frequency shell radius $k$ under the given assumptions, particularly the negligibility of points on symmetry axes and the flat Ewald sphere.\n\nThus, we have derived the two required quantities.
