It is a standard problem in the quantitative modeling of genome-wide CRISPR screens. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the initial number of cells, $N$, required to achieve a specified post-selection library coverage, $c$. The derivation will proceed from first principles based on the provided probabilistic model.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters given in the problem statement:\n- Size of the single guide RNA (sgRNA) library: $L = 120,000$.\n- Desired post-selection coverage: $c = 300$.\n- Multiplicity of infection (MOI): $\\lambda = 0.3$.\n- Transduction efficiency (probability of integration per virion): $\\eta = 0.20$.\n- Survival probability for cells with at least one integration: $s = 0.80$.\n\nThe model states that the number of successful integrations per cell, let us denote this by the random variable $K$, follows a Poisson distribution. The mean of this distribution, $\\mu$, is the product of the mean number of virions delivered per cell ($\\lambda$) and the probability that any single virion successfully integrates ($\\eta$). This is based on the principle of Poisson thinning.\n$$ \\mu = E[K] = \\lambda \\eta $$\nThe probability mass function for $K$ is therefore:\n$$ P(K=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu) \\mu^k}{k!} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n\nThe goal is to find the total number of starting cells, $N$. The linkage between $N$ and the desired coverage $c$ is the expected total number of surviving integrated sgRNA constructs. Let us denote this quantity by $E_{total}$. The problem defines coverage as:\n$$ c = \\frac{E_{total}}{L} $$\nThis implies $E_{total} = c L$.\n\nThe total expectation $E_{total}$ is the sum of the expected contributions from each of the $N$ independent and identically distributed starting cells. Let $E_C$ be the expected number of surviving integrated constructs from a single starting cell. Then, by linearity of expectation:\n$$ E_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E_C = N E_C $$\n\nOur central task is to derive an expression for $E_C$. Let $K_S$ be the random variable representing the number of surviving integrated constructs from one cell. A construct survives if and only if the cell it integrated into survives the selection process.\nAccording to the problem:\n1. If a cell has $K=0$ integrations, it is eliminated by antibiotic selection. Thus, the number of surviving constructs is $0$.\n2. If a cell has $K=k \\ge 1$ integrations, it survives the second selection step with probability $s$. If it survives, all $k$ of its integrated constructs survive. If it does not survive (with probability $1-s$), the number of surviving constructs is $0$.\n\nWe can calculate $E_C = E[K_S]$ using the law of total expectation, conditioning on the number of initial integrations, $K$.\n$$ E_C = E[K_S] = E[E[K_S | K]] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} E[K_S | K=k] P(K=k) $$\n\nWe evaluate the conditional expectation $E[K_S | K=k]$ for each possible value of $k$:\n- For $k=0$, the cell is eliminated. So, $E[K_S | K=0] = 0$.\n- For $k \\ge 1$, the cell survives with probability $s$, in which case it contributes $k$ constructs. It is eliminated with probability $1-s$, contributing $0$ constructs. The expected number of surviving constructs, given $k$ initial integrations, is therefore $E[K_S | K=k] = k \\cdot s + 0 \\cdot (1-s) = ks$.\n\nSubstituting these into the sum for $E_C$:\n$$ E_C = E[K_S | K=0] P(K=0) + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} E[K_S | K=k] P(K=k) $$\n$$ E_C = 0 \\cdot P(K=0) + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (ks) P(K=k) $$\n$$ E_C = s \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k P(K=k) $$\n\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k P(K=k)$ is related to the expectation of the Poisson-distributed random variable $K$. The expectation of $K$ is:\n$$ E[K] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k P(K=k) = 0 \\cdot P(K=0) + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k P(K=k) $$\nSince $E[K] = \\mu$, we have:\n$$ E_C = s \\cdot E[K] = s \\mu $$\n\nNow we can relate the total number of cells $N$ to the coverage $c$.\nWe have $E_{total} = N E_C = N s \\mu$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of coverage:\n$$ c = \\frac{N s \\mu}{L} $$\nSolving for $N$, we obtain the general expression:\n$$ N = \\frac{c L}{s \\mu} $$\nFinally, substituting $\\mu = \\lambda \\eta$:\n$$ N = \\frac{c L}{s \\lambda \\eta} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $N$ using the provided parameters:\n$c = 300$\n$L = 120,000$\n$s = 0.80$\n$\\lambda = 0.3$\n$\\eta = 0.20$\n\n$$ N = \\frac{300 \\times 120,000}{0.80 \\times 0.3 \\times 0.20} $$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$ 300 \\times 120,000 = 36,000,000 $$\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n$$ 0.80 \\times 0.3 \\times 0.20 = 0.80 \\times 0.06 = 0.048 $$\nNow, perform the division:\n$$ N = \\frac{36,000,000}{0.048} = \\frac{36 \\times 10^6}{48 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{36}{48} \\times 10^{9} $$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{36}{48} = \\frac{3 \\times 12}{4 \\times 12} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 $$\nThus,\n$$ N = 0.75 \\times 10^9 = 750,000,000 $$\nThe required number of starting cells is $750,000,000$.

This is especially true in genetically complex systems like cancer cells, where phenomena such as gene amplification can create significant artifacts. This exercise [@problem_id:2946920] challenges you to compare CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens, dissecting why one may be preferable to the other for avoiding copy-number-related toxicity and how even CRISPRi can have its own subtle, context-dependent confounders.", "problem": "A pooled genome-scale screen is performed in a human cancer cell line that harbors a focal amplification of a chromosome segment containing an oncogene, here denoted $G^\\*$, present at copy number $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$ with $C_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\approx 20$, while most of the genome is near $2$ copies. Two screening modalities are run in parallel using the same single-guide Ribonucleic Acid (sgRNA) library: a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 nuclease knockout screen and a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen using deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused to Krüppel-associated box (KRAB). The cell line is wild-type for tumor protein p53 (TP53).\n\nThe following observations are made: in the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease screen, many sgRNAs mapping anywhere within the amplified segment (including intergenic regions) produce strong negative viability scores that correlate with $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$. In contrast, in the CRISPR interference screen, strong negative viability scores are observed for sgRNAs targeting the transcription start site region of $G^\\*$ and for a subset of sgRNAs targeting nearby noncoding regulatory elements within a few kilobases, but not for sgRNAs targeting distant intergenic sites within the amplicon.\n\nUsing only fundamental principles and core definitions, argue when CRISPR interference avoids copy-number–mediated double-strand break toxicity and identify scenarios under which CRISPR interference could still be confounded by transcriptional dependencies in amplified regions. Base your reasoning on the following widely accepted facts: CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at DNA targets, DSB load activates DNA damage responses including p53-dependent checkpoints, CRISPR interference uses dCas9-KRAB to repress transcription without introducing DSBs, copy-number amplification increases the number of matching DNA target sites, and KRAB-mediated repression acts through chromatin modification that can influence nearby regulatory DNA on the kilobase scale.\n\nWhich of the following statements are most consistent with these principles and the observations? Select all that apply.\n\nA. CRISPR interference avoids copy-number–mediated toxicity observed in CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease screens because dCas9-KRAB does not introduce DSBs; therefore the viability effect linked to the DNA damage response does not scale with the number of DNA target copies $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$.\n\nB. Despite avoiding DSBs, CRISPR interference can still yield apparent amplicon-linked dependencies if targeting a promoter within a tandemly duplicated region deposits KRAB-linked repressive chromatin that spreads over adjacent regulatory DNA (for example, enhancers located within a few kilobases), thereby reducing $G^\\*$ expression and producing a dependency that correlates with $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$.\n\nC. CRISPR interference is immune to copy-number–related artifacts because dCas9-KRAB binding is governed by messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) abundance rather than Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) template abundance; thus $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$ cannot influence guide occupancy.\n\nD. In extremely high-copy amplicons with repetitive promoter sequences (for example, extrachromosomal DNA where $C_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\gg 10$), a single CRISPR interference sgRNA matching that promoter can bind many identical promoter copies, reducing the total transcript output from the amplicon in proportion to $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$ and yielding an apparent copy-number–correlated dependency even if each individual gene copy would not be essential at baseline copy number.\n\nE. The only way CRISPR interference can be confounded in amplified regions is via off-target cleavage at mismatched loci, which is eliminated by using a nuclease-dead Cas9; therefore no copy-number–related confounders remain.\n\nF. CRISPR interference sgRNAs that target duplicated noncoding elements co-amplified within the segment (for example, a high-output enhancer sequence driving $G^\\*$ that has been tandemly duplicated) can silence that enhancer, causing an amplicon enhancer dependency whose magnitude tracks $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$, even when the intended on-target gene adjacent to the guide is not itself causal for fitness.\n\nAnswer choices have been written to include plausible but incorrect reasoning. Your task is to select the statements that best capture when CRISPR interference avoids copy-number–mediated DSB toxicity and when it could still be confounded by transcriptional dependencies in amplified regions.", "solution": "The user has provided a problem statement regarding the interpretation of genome-wide CRISPR screens in a cancer cell line with a focal gene amplification. The problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and based on established principles of molecular biology and functional genomics. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the differential effects of two CRISPR-based technologies—CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease knockout and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)—in the context of a high copy number amplification ($C_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\approx 20$). The cell line is wild-type for TP53, which is a critical detail.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease screen. The Cas9 nuclease is programmed by a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) to create a double-strand break (DSB) at a specific DNA target. In a region amplified $\\approx 20$-fold, an sgRNA targeting any sequence within that amplicon will generate $\\approx 20$ DSBs simultaneously. In a TP53-proficient background, a high DSB load robustly activates the DNA Damage Response (DDR), leading to p53-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This results in a strong negative viability phenotype (cell depletion) that is independent of the function of the targeted DNA sequence. The effect is a direct consequence of the massively increased DNA damage, and its magnitude correlates with the copy number, $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$. This explains the observation that \"many sgRNAs mapping anywhere within the amplified segment (including intergenic regions) produce strong negative viability scores\". This phenomenon is a well-known artifact in CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens.\n\nNext, we analyze the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen. This technology uses a nuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a transcriptional repressor domain, typically Krüppel-associated box (KRAB). dCas9-KRAB binds to target DNA as directed by the sgRNA but does not cleave it. Thus, it does not generate DSBs. Its function is to recruit cellular machinery that establishes repressive heterochromatin, thereby silencing transcription at and near the target locus. This mechanism inherently avoids the DSB-dependent toxicity observed with Cas9 nuclease. The observed negative viability scores are therefore expected to result from the transcriptional repression of genes or regulatory elements that are essential for cell survival. The observation that hits are confined to the transcription start site (TSS) of the oncogene $G^\\*$ and nearby regulatory elements, but not distant intergenic sites, is consistent with this mechanism. The cell's viability depends on the expression of $G^\\*$, an example of oncogene addiction.\n\nThe question asks when CRISPRi avoids this DSB toxicity and when it can still be confounded.\n1.  **Avoiding Toxicity**: CRISPRi avoids the copy-number-mediated DSB toxicity precisely because dCas9 does not create DSBs.\n2.  **Potential Confounders**: Despite avoiding DSB toxicity, CRISPRi is not free from artifacts, especially in complex genomic regions like amplicons. These can include:\n    *   **Context-Dependent Essentiality**: A gene like $G^\\*$ may not be essential at diploid copy number ($2$) but becomes essential when amplified to $C_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\approx 20$, as the cell becomes \"addicted\" to its high expression. Repressing such a gene causes a viability loss that correlates with $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$. This is a true biological dependency but can confound the search for universally essential genes.\n    *   **Chromatin Spreading**: The repressive chromatin established by dCas9-KRAB can spread several kilobases from the initial binding site. An sgRNA targeting a non-essential gene or inert region could cause a phenotype if the repression spreads to a nearby essential gene (like $G^\\*$) or a critical regulatory element.\n    *   **Misattribution of Noncoding Hits**: An sgRNA might target a functional noncoding element, such as an enhancer for $G^\\*$. The resulting viability phenotype is real, but screen analysis pipelines often annotate sgRNAs to the nearest gene, leading to the misattribution of the effect to a potentially non-causal \"target\" gene. If such an enhancer is co-amplified, the effect will be stronger.\n\nBased on these principles, I will evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. CRISPR interference avoids copy-number–mediated toxicity observed in CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease screens because dCas9-KRAB does not introduce DSBs; therefore the viability effect linked to the DNA damage response does not scale with the number of DNA target copies $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$.**\n*   **Analysis**: This statement is fundamentally correct. The absence of nuclease activity in dCas9 is the key reason why CRISPRi is not subject to the massive DSB-induced, p53-dependent cell death that plagues Cas9 nuclease screens in amplified regions. Because no DSBs are formed, the DDR is not activated in a copy-number-dependent manner. This directly addresses the first part of the problem's query.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Despite avoiding DSBs, CRISPR interference can still yield apparent amplicon-linked dependencies if targeting a promoter within a tandemly duplicated region deposits KRAB-linked repressive chromatin that spreads over adjacent regulatory DNA (for example, enhancers located within a few kilobases), thereby reducing $G^\\*$ expression and producing a dependency that correlates with $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$.**\n*   **Analysis**: This describes a valid confounding mechanism based on a known property of KRAB-mediated repression: the spreading of heterochromatin. If an sgRNA targets a sequence near a critical element for $G^\\*$ expression, such as an enhancer, the local chromatin repression can spread to that element, silencing it indirectly. This would create a viability phenotype that is not due to the repression of the intended sgRNA target. This is a plausible scenario for a confounding hit in a CRISPRi screen.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. CRISPR interference is immune to copy-number–related artifacts because dCas9-KRAB binding is governed by messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) abundance rather than Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) template abundance; thus $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$ cannot influence guide occupancy.**\n*   **Analysis**: This statement contains a critical factual error. The CRISPR system, including dCas9-KRAB, targets DNA, not mRNA. The binding of the dCas9-sgRNA complex is determined by the presence of a matching sequence in the genomic DNA. Therefore, the number of available binding sites is directly proportional to the DNA copy number, $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$. The premise is false, and so is the conclusion.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In extremely high-copy amplicons with repetitive promoter sequences (for example, extrachromosomal DNA where $C_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\gg 10$), a single CRISPR interference sgRNA matching that promoter can bind many identical promoter copies, reducing the total transcript output from the amplicon in proportion to $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$ and yielding an apparent copy-number–correlated dependency even if each individual gene copy would not be essential at baseline copy number.**\n*   **Analysis**: This statement accurately describes the phenomenon of context-dependent essentiality driven by gene amplification. Cells can become addicted to the high level of an oncoprotein produced from an amplicon. While the gene might be non-essential at a normal copy number of $2$, the cellular state becomes dependent on its overexpression from $C_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\approx 20$ copies. CRISPRi-mediated repression of this gene would cause a significant drop in its product, leading to a viability defect. The strength of this \"dependency\" is linked to the high copy number itself, making it a \"copy-number-correlated dependency\". This is a key concept in interpreting screens in cancer cells and represents a type of confounder when searching for general vulnerabilities.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**E. The only way CRISPR interference can be confounded in amplified regions is via off-target cleavage at mismatched loci, which is eliminated by using a nuclease-dead Cas9; therefore no copy-number–related confounders remain.**\n*   **Analysis**: This statement is incorrect on multiple counts. First, the claim that off-target cleavage is the *only* confounder is false; we have already identified valid confounders in options B, D, and F. Second, while dCas9 eliminates off-target *cleavage*, it can still bind to off-target sites and cause transcriptional repression, which is itself a potential source of confounding effects. The conclusion that \"no copy-number–related confounders remain\" is demonstrably false.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. CRISPR interference sgRNAs that target duplicated noncoding elements co-amplified within the segment (for example, a high-output enhancer sequence driving $G^\\*$ that has been tandemly duplicated) can silence that enhancer, causing an amplicon enhancer dependency whose magnitude tracks $C_{\\mathrm{amp}}$, even when the intended on-target gene adjacent to the guide is not itself causal for fitness.**\n*   **Analysis**: This describes another valid and important confounding scenario in the interpretation of CRISPRi screens, particularly those targeting the noncoding genome. An sgRNA may physically target a noncoding element, but standard analysis pipelines attribute its effect to the nearest annotated gene. If the targeted noncoding element is a crucial enhancer for a distant driver oncogene (like $G^\\*$), silencing it will produce a strong viability phenotype. This effect is then incorrectly blamed on the \"intended on-target gene,\" which may be a non-functional passenger. This is a potent confounder that directly addresses the observation of hits in \"noncoding regulatory elements.\"\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDF}$$", "id": "2946920"}, {"introduction": "Once a CRISPR screen yields raw sequencing counts, the next challenge is to distinguish true biological signals from statistical noise.

Comparing this with $\\mu + \\phi\\mu^2$, we find $r = \\frac{1}{\\phi}$.\nGiven $\\phi = 0.5$, the size parameter is constant for all guides: $r = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$.\nThe probability parameter $p_i$ for each guide $i$ depends on its null mean $\\mu_i$: $p_i = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5 \\mu_i}$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a negative binomial random variable $X$ with parameters $r=2$ and $p$ is given by:\n$\\mathbb{P}(X=k) = \\binom{k+r-1}{k} p^r (1-p)^k = \\binom{k+1}{k} p^2 (1-p)^k = (k+1) p^2 (1-p)^k$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe raw $p$-value for a one-sided depletion test is the cumulative probability $p_i = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq y_i)$, where $y_i$ is the observed count.\n\nWe now compute the raw $p$-values for each of the $6$ guides.\n\n- **Guide $1$**: $(\\mu_1, y_1) = (24, 0)$\n$p_1 = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5 \\times 24} = \\frac{1}{1+12} = \\frac{1}{13}$.\n$p_{val,1} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 0) = \\mathbb{P}(X=0) = (0+1) p_1^2 (1-p_1)^0 = (\\frac{1}{13})^2 = \\frac{1}{169}$.\n\n- **Guide $2$**: $(\\mu_2, y_2) = (6, 0)$\n$p_2 = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5 \\times 6} = \\frac{1}{1+3} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n$p_{val,2} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 0) = \\mathbb{P}(X=0) = (\\frac{1}{4})^2 = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n- **Guide $3$**: $(\\mu_3, y_3) = (4, 0)$\n$p_3 = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5 \\times 4} = \\frac{1}{1+2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n$p_{val,3} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 0) = \\mathbb{P}(X=0) = (\\frac{1}{3})^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\n- **Guide $4$**: $(\\mu_4, y_4) = (5, 1)$\n$p_4 = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5 \\times 5} = \\frac{1}{1+2.5} = \\frac{1}{3.5} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n$p_{val,4} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 1) = \\mathbb{P}(X=0) + \\mathbb{P}(X=1)$.\n$\\mathbb{P}(X=0) = (\\frac{2}{7})^2 = \\frac{4}{49}$.\n$\\mathbb{P}(X=1) = (1+1)(\\frac{2}{7})^2 (1-\\frac{2}{7})^1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{49} \\cdot \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{40}{343}$.\n$p_{val,4} = \\frac{4}{49} + \\frac{40}{343} = \\frac{28}{343} + \\frac{40}{343} = \\frac{68}{343}$.\n\n- **Guide $5$**: $(\\mu_5, y_5) = (1, 0)$\n$p_5 = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5 \\times 1} = \\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$p_{val,5} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 0) = \\mathbb{P}(X=0) = (\\frac{2}{3})^2 = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\n- **Guide $6$**: $(\\mu_6, y_6) = (3, 2)$\n$p_6 = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{1+1.5} = \\frac{1}{2.5} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n$p_{val,6} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 2) = \\mathbb{P}(X=0) + \\mathbb{P}(X=1) + \\mathbb{P}(X=2)$.\n$\\mathbb{P}(X=0) = (\\frac{2}{5})^2 = \\frac{4}{25}$.\n$\\mathbb{P}(X=1) = 2(\\frac{2}{5})^2(1-\\frac{2}{5})^1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{25} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{24}{125}$.\n$\\mathbb{P}(X=2) = 3(\\frac{2}{5})^2(1-\\frac{2}{5})^2 = 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{25} \\cdot (\\frac{3}{5})^2 = \\frac{12}{25} \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{108}{625}$.\n$p_{val,6} = \\frac{4}{25} + \\frac{24}{125} + \\frac{108}{625} = \\frac{100}{625} + \\frac{120}{625} + \\frac{108}{625} = \\frac{328}{625}$.\n\nThe set of raw $p$-values is $\\{\\frac{1}{169}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{68}{343}, \\frac{4}{9}, \\frac{328}{625}\\}$.\nIn decimal form, this is approximately $\\{0.0059, 0.0625, 0.1111, 0.1983, 0.4444, 0.5248\\}$.\n\nNext, we apply the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at level $\\alpha = 0.05$.\nLet $m=6$ be the number of tests. We sort the $p$-values in ascending order, $p_{(1)} \\leq p_{(2)} \\leq \\dots \\leq p_{(6)}$:\n$p_{(1)} = \\frac{1}{169} \\approx 0.005917$\n$p_{(2)} = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$\n$p_{(3)} = \\frac{1}{9} \\approx 0.111111$\n$p_{(4)} = \\frac{68}{343} \\approx 0.198251$\n$p_{(5)} = \\frac{4}{9} \\approx 0.444444$\n$p_{(6)} = \\frac{328}{625} = 0.5248$\n\nThe BH procedure finds the largest integer $k$ such that $p_{(k)} \\leq \\frac{k}{m} \\alpha$. For $i=1, \\dots, k$, the corresponding null hypotheses are rejected.\n\nWe test this condition for $i=1, 2, \\dots, 6$ with $m=6$ and $\\alpha=0.05$:\n- For $i=1$: Is $p_{(1)} \\leq \\frac{1}{6} \\times 0.05$?\n$\\frac{1}{169} \\leq \\frac{0.05}{6} \\implies 0.005917 \\dots \\leq 0.008333 \\dots$. The condition holds.\n\n- For $i=2$: Is $p_{(2)} \\leq \\frac{2}{6} \\times 0.05$?\n$\\frac{1}{16} \\leq \\frac{0.10}{6} \\implies 0.0625 \\leq 0.016666 \\dots$. The condition does not hold.\n\nSince the condition fails for $i=2$, it will also fail for all subsequent values of $i$ because the $p$-values $p_{(i)}$ increase more rapidly than the linear threshold $\\frac{i}{m} \\alpha$.\nThe largest value of $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k=1$.\n\nTherefore, according to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, we reject the null hypothesis only for the guide corresponding to the smallest $p$-value, $p_{(1)}$. The total number of guides called significant at an FDR of $0.05$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2946969"}]}
