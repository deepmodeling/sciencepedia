The parameters are realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The phrasing \"Boltzmann weight of its end instability\" implies that the probability of selection increases with higher free energy ($\\Delta G$), which is a known feature of guide strand selection. This can be modeled by defining the effective \"energy\" of the selection state as being inversely proportional to the thermodynamic stability of the duplex end. Thus, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the local free energy of base-pairing for the $5^{\\prime}$ end of each strand, then calculating the difference, and finally using this difference in a Boltzmann-derived probability model.\n\nFirst, we determine the free energy of the sense strand's $5^{\\prime}$ end, $\\Delta G_{\\text{sense }5^{\\prime}\\text{ end}}$.

This means the probability of selection, $P_i$, is an increasing function of its associated end energy, $\\Delta G_i$. The model specifies that this probability is proportional to the Boltzmann weight of its \"instability\".

The assumption of rapid, irreversible product release simplifies the model by ignoring product inhibition, which is reasonable given that cleaved mRNA fragments have low affinity for the guide RNA.\n\nWe can analyze two informative limiting regimes:\n\nFirst, consider the chemistry-limited regime, where the chemical cleavage step is much slower than the conformational transitions: $k_{c} \\ll k_{a}$ and $k_{c} \\ll k_{-a}$.

In this scenario, the rate-limiting step for turnover at saturation is the forward conformational change, $k_{a}$. Once the RISC complex adopts the active conformation $ES^{\\ast}$, it proceeds to catalysis almost instantaneously.

In metazoans, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-like perfect pairing between a guide RNA and its messenger RNA (mRNA) target allows Ago2-dependent endonucleolytic cleavage (“slicing”), whereas GW182 mediates recruitment of the CCR4–NOT deadenylase, PAN2–PAN3, the DCP1–DCP2 decapping complex, and associated translational repression factors such as DEAD-box helicase DDX6 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E homolog protein (4EHP). Consider a perfectly complementary target site placed in the 3' untranslated region of a reporter mRNA. You engineer an Ago2 variant with a catalytic center mutation that abolishes slicing but preserves GW182-binding and allosteric activation of the CCR4–NOT axis. The guide RNA is unchanged and maintains perfect complementarity to the target.\n\nFrom first principles, use the Central Dogma (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ protein), the definition of RISC-mediated repression, and the standard fate of polyadenylated mRNA under deadenylation–decapping pathways to predict the repression phenotype. Assume the following kinetic abstraction: in wild type, the mRNA can be removed via two parallel processes, Ago2 slicing with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{slice}}$ and GW182-dependent deadenylation–decapping–exonucleolysis with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$. The overall first-order removal rate is $k_{\\mathrm{tot}}=k_{\\mathrm{slice}}+k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$, with mRNA half-life $t_{1/2}=\\ln(2)/k_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.

However, its ability to recruit the scaffold protein GW182 and its downstream effectors is preserved. We must predict the resulting phenotype based on first principles of molecular biology and the provided kinetic model.\n\nThe Central Dogma states that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. RNA interference (RNAi) acts at the post-transcriptional level, targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) for translational repression and/or degradation, thereby reducing protein output.\n\nIn the wild-type (WT) metazoan system with a perfectly complementary target, two major repressive mechanisms operate in parallel after the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) binds the mRNA:\n1. **Slicing:** Ago2 itself is a catalytic enzyme (an RNase H-like endonuclease) that cleaves the phosphodiester backbone of the target mRNA between target nucleotides 10 and 11 relative to the 5' end of the guide RNA. This act is termed \"slicing\" and generates a 5' fragment and a 3' fragment. These uncapped and non-polyadenylated fragments are rapidly degraded by cellular exonucleases. For perfectly complementary targets, this is typically the dominant and most rapid mode of mRNA clearance. The rate of this process is given by the constant $k_{\\mathrm{slice}}$.\n2. **GW182-mediated repression:** Ago2 recruits a GW182 protein (TNRC6 family). GW182 acts as a platform to recruit multiple effector complexes. As stated in the problem, these include:\n    - Deadenylase complexes (CCR4–NOT, PAN2–PAN3), which shorten the 3' poly(A) tail of the mRNA. Deadenylation is often the first and rate-limiting step in the major mRNA decay pathway in eukaryotes.\n    - The decapping complex (DCP1–DCP2), which removes the 5' $m^7G$ cap, exposing the mRNA to 5' → 3' exonucleolytic degradation by enzymes like XRN1.\n    - Translational repressors (DDX6, 4EHP), which interfere with translation initiation or promote mRNA storage in processing bodies (P-bodies). This leads to the dissociation of ribosomes from the mRNA.\nThe combined effect of these GW182-mediated activities is mRNA destabilization and translational silencing. The rate of this entire pathway is represented by the constant $k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$.\n\nThe problem defines a kinetic model where the total rate of mRNA removal in the WT system is the sum of the rates of these two parallel processes:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{tot, WT}} = k_{\\mathrm{slice}} + k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$$\nThe corresponding mRNA half-life is $t_{1/2, \\text{WT}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\mathrm{tot, WT}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\mathrm{slice}} + k_{\\mathrm{GW}}}$.\n\nNow, let us analyze the engineered mutant system. The Ago2 variant has a catalytic mutation, meaning it cannot slice the mRNA. Thus, for the mutant system, $k_{\\mathrm{slice}} = 0$. The problem explicitly states that GW182 recruitment and function are preserved, so $k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$ remains unchanged.\n\nThe new total removal rate for the mutant system is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{tot, mutant}} = 0 + k_{\\mathrm{GW}} = k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$$\nThe new half-life is:\n$$t_{1/2, \\text{mutant}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\mathrm{tot, mutant}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\mathrm{GW}}}$$\n\nWe can now predict the phenotype of the mutant system by comparing it to the WT:\n\n1. **Endonucleolytic cleavage fragments:** Slicing is abolished ($k_{\\mathrm{slice}} = 0$). Therefore, the specific 5' and 3' cleavage products characteristic of Ago2 activity will be absent. The mRNA will remain full-length until it is degraded by the alternative pathway.\n\n2. **Poly(A) tail status:** The only remaining degradation pathway is the one mediated by GW182, which initiates with the recruitment of deadenylases (CCR4–NOT). Thus, the full-length reporter mRNA population will undergo progressive shortening of its poly(A) tail prior to its ultimate decay.\n\n3. **mRNA decay kinetics:** Since slicing is a potent mechanism, it is safe to assume $k_{\\mathrm{slice}} > 0$ in the WT case. By comparing the rate constants, $k_{\\mathrm{tot, mutant}} = k_{\\mathrm{GW}}  k_{\\mathrm{slice}} + k_{\\mathrm{GW}} = k_{\\mathrm{tot, WT}}$. A smaller decay rate constant implies a longer half-life. Therefore, $t_{1/2, \\text{mutant}} > t_{1/2, \\text{WT}}$. mRNA decay will be slower in the mutant system compared to wild type.\n\n4. **Polysome association:** The GW182 platform is intact and recruits translational repressors like DDX6 and 4EHP. These factors inhibit translation initiation, causing the mRNA to shift from heavily translating polysomes (multiple ribosomes) to lighter fractions, such as monosomes (single ribosomes) or ribosome-free mRNP particles.\n\n5. **Protein output:** Repression is not abolished; it is merely rerouted through a different, and generally slower, mechanism. The combination of translational repression and slower mRNA decay will still lead to a reduction in protein output compared to a non-targeted control. However, because the fast slicing pathway is eliminated, the overall repression will be less potent, and the decline in protein level will be slower than in the WT system.\n\nBased on this step-by-step derivation, we can evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Endonucleolytic cleavage fragments (5'/3') will be absent; the reporter mRNA will accumulate as full-length but progressively deadenylated species; decay will proceed via GW182-dependent deadenylation–decapping with $k_{\\mathrm{tot}}=k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$ so that $t_{1/2}$ increases relative to wild type; polysome association will shift toward lighter fractions due to translational repression mediated by CCR4–NOT/DDX6/4EHP; protein output will be reduced, but more slowly and to a lesser extent than in wild type where slicing dominates.**\nThis statement accurately describes every predicted consequence. The absence of cleavage fragments is correct. The switch to a deadenylation-initiated pathway is correct. The kinetic analysis ($k_{\\mathrm{tot}}=k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$, $t_{1/2}$ increases) is correct. The effect on polysome association is correct. The final conclusion about a still-present but attenuated repression of protein output is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Repression will be abolished because perfect complementarity requires slicing; mRNA and protein levels will be indistinguishable from a non-targeted control, with no change in poly(A) tail length, no change in $t_{1/2}$, and unchanged polysome association.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Its premise that perfect complementarity *requires* slicing for any repression to occur is false. The GW182-dependent pathway remains functional as specified in the problem, so repression is not abolished. Consequently, mRNA and protein levels will be lower than a non-targeted control, the poly(A) tail will be shortened, the half-life will be altered, and polysome association will change.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Repression will be stronger and faster than wild type because GW182-dependent decay will compensate and add to slicing-independent nucleases; both endonucleolytic cleavage fragments and deadenylated species will be detected; $k_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ will exceed the wild-type value and protein output will decline more rapidly.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Removing a parallel decay pathway ($k_{\\mathrm{slice}}$) cannot result in a faster overall decay rate ($k_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ cannot exceed $k_{\\mathrm{slice}} + k_{\\mathrm{GW}}$). The prediction of stronger and faster repression is wrong. The claim that cleavage fragments will be detected is also wrong, as Ago2 catalysis is ablated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. GW182 recruitment will restore slicing-like decay by recruiting an RNase that substitutes for Ago2 catalysis; cleavage fragments will remain detectable and repression kinetics (including $t_{1/2}$ and protein decline) will be indistinguishable from wild type.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It postulates a hypothetical compensatory mechanism that is not part of the established RNAi model described in the problem. There is no basis to assume GW182 recruits a substitute endonuclease. Therefore, cleavage fragments will not be detectable, and the kinetics of repression will demonstrably change because a major kinetic component ($k_{\\mathrm{slice}}$) has been removed from the system.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that aligns with a rigorous application of the provided principles and information is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2771681"}]}
