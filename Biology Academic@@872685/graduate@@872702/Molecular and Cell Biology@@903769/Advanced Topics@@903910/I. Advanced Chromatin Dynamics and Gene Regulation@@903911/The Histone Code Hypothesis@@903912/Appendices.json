Bromodomains are prototypical readers of acetyl-lysine, often using a conserved tyrosine in the pocket to engage the acetyl-lysine carbonyl via hydrogen bonding and a structured water network while also providing aromatic hydrophobic contacts to the acetyl methyl group. Consider a bromodomain in which the pocket tyrosine is mutated to phenylalanine (a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation), removing the hydroxyl group but retaining the aromatic ring. High-resolution structures indicate that the shape of the hydrophobic cavity and van der Waals contacts to the acetyl-lysine methyl group are preserved, but the hydrogen bond donor capability of the tyrosine hydroxyl and an associated bridging water are lost.

This interaction involves:\n    1. A hydrogen bond from the tyrosine's hydroxyl group to the acetyl-lysine's carbonyl oxygen.\n    2. A structured water network.\n    3. Aromatic hydrophobic contacts between the tyrosine's ring and the acetyl-lysine's methyl group.\n- **Mutation**: The pocket tyrosine is mutated to a phenylalanine (Phe).

The roles of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and solvent reorganization in determining binding thermodynamics are fundamental principles. The Y-to-F mutation is a classic tool to probe the function of the tyrosine hydroxyl group. The described system and its properties are scientifically accurate and realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. It defines the system (WT), the specific perturbation (Y-to-F mutation), and the parameters to be evaluated. The provided structural information is sufficient to allow for a reasoned prediction based on first principles. A unique and meaningful solution is derivable.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective bias.\n\nThe problem statement has no scientific or factual unsoundness, is not non-formalizable, is complete and consistent, is realistic, well-posed, and non-trivial. It is therefore determined to be a valid scientific problem.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution. We will analyze the consequences of the Y-to-F mutation by dissecting its effects on the binding energetics and kinetics from first principles.\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy of binding is given by the relation $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$. The dissociation constant $K_D$ is related to $\\Delta G$ by $\\Delta G = RT \\ln K_D$, and to the kinetic rates by $K_D = k_{\\mathrm{off}} / k_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n\n1.  **Effect on Binding Enthalpy ($\\Delta H$)**:\n    The problem states that the hydrogen bond between the tyrosine hydroxyl and the acetyl-lysine carbonyl is lost. Hydrogen bonds are highly favorable enthalpic interactions, characterized by a negative contribution to $\\Delta H$. The formation of a hydrogen bond releases heat. Consequently, the loss of this interaction upon mutation removes a significant favorable contribution to the binding enthalpy. This means the overall $\\Delta H$ of binding for the mutant will be less negative (less favorable) compared to the wild-type. Therefore, the change in enthalpy is unfavorable.\n\n2.  **Effect on Binding Entropy ($\\Delta S$)**:\n    The problem states that an \"associated bridging water\" and a \"structured water network\" are lost. In the WT complex, water molecules can be ordered at the protein-ligand interface. The Y-to-F mutation, by removing a polar hydroxyl group that organizes these waters, leads to their release into the bulk solvent. The transition of water molecules from a constrained, ordered state to a disordered state in the bulk increases the entropy of the system. This contributes a positive (favorable) term to the overall change in entropy of binding, $\\Delta S$. Thus, the binding process for the mutant is associated with a more favorable (more positive) entropy change compared to the wild-type.\n\n3.  **Effect on Gibbs Free Energy ($\\Delta G$) and Dissociation Constant ($K_D$)**:\n    We have an unfavorable change in enthalpy (less negative $\\Delta H$) and a favorable change in entropy (more positive $\\Delta S$). This phenomenon is known as enthalpy-entropy compensation. The net effect on the Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, depends on the magnitude of these two opposing effects. The loss of a specific, strong hydrogen bond in a pre-organized binding site typically results in an energetic penalty of several kJ/mol, which often outweighs the entropic gain from releasing one or two water molecules. Therefore, it is most probable that the overall change in $\\Delta G$ will be unfavorable (i.e., $\\Delta G_{\\text{mutant}}$ will be less negative than $\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}}$).\n    Since $\\Delta G = RT \\ln K_D$, a less negative (less favorable) $\\Delta G$ directly corresponds to a larger value for $K_D$. An increase in $K_D$ signifies weaker binding (lower affinity).\n\n4.  **Effect on Kinetic Parameters ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$)**:\n    The dissociation constant is the ratio of the off-rate to the on-rate, $K_D = k_{\\mathrm{off}} / k_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The increase in $K_D$ (weaker binding) must result from an increase in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and/or a decrease in $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n    -   The off-rate, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, is a measure of the stability of the bound complex. The hydrogen bond provided by the tyrosine hydroxyl is a key stabilizing interaction. Removing it lowers the activation energy barrier for dissociation, making it easier for the ligand to unbind. This leads to a faster dissociation rate, meaning $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ will increase.\n    -   The on-rate, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is related to the rate of initial association, which is often governed by diffusion and long-range interactions that steer the ligand into the binding site. The problem states that the overall shape of the binding pocket is preserved. The mutation is a localized change. Thus, the factors governing the initial encounter are not expected to change dramatically. It is reasonable to assume that $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ will be approximately preserved or change much less significantly than $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n    -   Therefore, the increase in $K_D$ is primarily driven by an increase in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n\n5.  **Effect on Selectivity**:\n    Selectivity is the preferential binding of acetyl-lysine (AcK) over unmodified lysine (K). The wild-type bromodomain achieves this through specific recognition of the acetyl group: hydrophobic contacts for the methyl group and an H-bond for the carbonyl group. Unmodified lysine, with its positively charged and polar $-\\text{NH}_3^+$ group, is a poor ligand for the hydrophobic pocket.\n    The Y-to-F mutation weakens the binding to AcK, as shown above. However, the pocket remains hydrophobic due to the phenylalanine ring, and is still a poor environment for the charged side chain of unmodified lysine. The binding to unmodified lysine will remain very weak. The core feature for selectivity—the hydrophobic pocket that recognizes the acetyl methyl group—is preserved. Thus, while the *strength* of binding to AcK is reduced, the *preference* for AcK over K is likely retained. The magnitude of selectivity, which can be quantified as the ratio of binding constants or the difference in free energies ($\\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\text{AcK}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{K}}$), will decrease, but significant selectivity will persist.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Loss of the hydrogen bond donor weakens enthalpic stabilization, making $\\,\\Delta H\\,$ less favorable (less negative), while release of a structured water and reduced polar ordering produce a modestly more favorable $\\,\\Delta S\\,$ (more positive). The net $\\,\\Delta G\\,$ becomes less favorable (less negative), so $\\,K_D\\,$ increases (weaker binding), driven mainly by an increased $\\,k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,$ with $\\,k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,$ approximately preserved, and selectivity for acetyl-lysine is reduced in magnitude but largely retained due to conserved hydrophobic contacts.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with all points of the derivation. It correctly identifies the enthalpic penalty from the lost H-bond, the entropic gain from water release, the net effect of weaker binding (less negative $\\Delta G$, increased $K_D$), the kinetic mechanism (increased $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$), and the effect on selectivity (reduced magnitude but retained preference).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Removing the hydroxyl eliminates a desolvation penalty, rendering $\\,\\Delta H\\,$ more favorable (more negative) and $\\,\\Delta S\\,$ less favorable (more negative), with a net more favorable $\\,\\Delta G\\,$ and decreased $\\,K_D\\,$ (tighter binding), mediated mainly by a decreased $\\,k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,$; acetyl-lysine selectivity increases.**\nThis option incorrectly claims $\\Delta H$ becomes more favorable. The dominant effect is the loss of the stabilizing H-bond, which is an enthalpic penalty. Subsequent conclusions of tighter binding and increased selectivity are therefore incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Hydrophobic contacts dominate the energetics so $\\,\\Delta H\\,$ is unchanged, but the mutation reduces pocket flexibility, making $\\,\\Delta S\\,$ less favorable (more negative); the net $\\,\\Delta G\\,$ becomes less favorable and $\\,K_D\\,$ increases, driven by a reduced $\\,k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,$ while $\\,k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,$ remains similar; selectivity is unchanged.**\nThis option incorrectly assumes $\\Delta H$ is unchanged, ignoring the loss of a significant H-bond. Its prediction for a less favorable $\\Delta S$ is contrary to the principle of solvent release. Its kinetic argument (reduced $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) is less likely than an increased $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The claim of unchanged selectivity is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Removal of a polar group strengthens the hydrophobic effect and displaces water, yielding a more favorable $\\,\\Delta S\\,$ (more positive) with negligible change to $\\,\\Delta H\\,$, making $\\,\\Delta G\\,$ more favorable and decreasing $\\,K_D\\,$; both $\\,k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,$ and $\\,k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,$ increase, and binding becomes more promiscuous, including stronger binding to unmodified lysine.**\nThis option incorrectly states a negligible change to $\\Delta H$ and a net more favorable $\\Delta G$ (tighter binding). Critically, it makes the false claim of stronger binding to unmodified lysine. A more hydrophobic pocket would repel the charged lysine side chain even more strongly.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Binding is abolished because cation–$\\pi$ interactions require tyrosine; replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine removes aromatic stabilization, causing $\\,K_D\\,$ to diverge and both $\\,k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,$ and $\\,k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,$ to approach zero; selectivity becomes meaningless due to loss of binding.**\nThis option makes several incorrect assertions. Phenylalanine can also participate in cation–$\\pi$ interactions. More importantly, the primary ligand is acetyl-lysine, which is neutral, so cation–$\\pi$ is not the main interaction. The prediction that $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ approaches zero contradicts the notion of abolished binding and a diverging $K_D$. Binding is weakened, not necessarily abolished.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2965955"}, {"introduction": "Just as important as reading the histone code is the process of writing it, which is carried out by a suite of enzymes whose activity is a critical cellular control point.

Once a seed exists, further spreading at zero temperature proceeds by flipping boundary spins, whose energy change is $\\Delta E_{\\text{edge}} = -2h$, which is favorable for any $h>0$, consistent with directional spreading from a nucleation site. The threshold derived above thus formalizes the condition for domain formation in this minimal Ising-like model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2J}{m}}$$", "id": "2965946"}]}
