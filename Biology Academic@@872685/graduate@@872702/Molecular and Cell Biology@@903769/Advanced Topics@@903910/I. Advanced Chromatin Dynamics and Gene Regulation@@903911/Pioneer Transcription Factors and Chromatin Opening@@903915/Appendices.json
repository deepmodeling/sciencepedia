It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We may proceed.\n\nThe task is to estimate the fraction of time a specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) motif on a nucleosome is exposed. This is a problem in equilibrium statistical mechanics. The fraction of time the system spends in a given macrostate is equivalent to the probability of finding the system in that macrostate at thermal equilibrium. This probability is determined by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the system as a two-state equilibrium between a \"not fully exposed\" macrostate and an \"exposed-by-at-least $\\ell$\" macrostate. This is a partition of the total configuration space. Let us first define the microscopic states. A microscopic state is defined by the number of base pairs, $n$, unwrapped from the DNA entry-exit point. We assume the free energy of unwrapping is a linear function of this length: $\\Delta G(n) = k_G n$, where $n$ is the number of unwrapped base pairs and $k_G$ is the free energy cost per base pair. The ground state, with $n=0$ (fully wrapped), has a reference free energy of $0$.\n\nThe problem states that the free energy cost is $\\Delta G_u = 2.5\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$ per $10\\,\\text{bp}$. From this, we determine the constant $k_G$:\n$$k_G = \\frac{2.5\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}}{10\\,\\text{bp}} = 0.25\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\text{bp}^{-1}$$\nThe probability of a given microscopic state $n$ is proportional to its Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-\\Delta G(n) / (RT))$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Note that $R$ must be used instead of the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ because the energy units are per mole.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum unwrapping length, $\\ell$, required for the transcription factor (TF) to bind. The motif has a length of $w = 15\\,\\text{bp}$ and its center is located at a distance $d = 30\\,\\text{bp}$ from the DNA entry-exit point. Assuming the motif is a linear segment, it occupies the region from $(d - w/2)$ to $(d + w/2)$. The problem states that full exposure requires unwrapping to the inner edge of the motif, which is the edge farther from the entry-exit point.\n$$\\ell = d + \\frac{w}{2} = 30\\,\\text{bp} + \\frac{15\\,\\text{bp}}{2} = 30\\,\\text{bp} + 7.5\\,\\text{bp} = 37.5\\,\\text{bp}$$\n\nThe free energy cost to expose the motif, which we denote $\\Delta G_{\\text{expose}}(\\ell)$, corresponds to the energy required to unwrap this length $\\ell$:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{expose}}(\\ell) = k_G \\times \\ell = (0.25\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\text{bp}^{-1}) \\times (37.5\\,\\text{bp}) = 9.375\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we must correctly formulate the fraction of time the motif is exposed. This corresponds to the probability that the system is in any state $n$ where $n \\ge \\ell$. The \"exposed-by-at-least $\\ell$\" macrostate is the set of all microscopic states $\\{n | n \\ge \\ell\\}$. The \"not fully exposed\" macrostate is the set of all states $\\{n | 0 \\le n < \\ell\\}$.

The sum is $\\sum_{k=a}^{b} r^k = \\frac{r^a - r^{b+1}}{1-r}$.\n$$Z_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1 - x^{N+1}}{1-x}$$\n$$Z_{\\text{exposed}} = \\frac{x^{\\ell} - x^{N+1}}{1-x}$$\nTherefore,\n$$f_{\\text{exposed}} = \\frac{x^{\\ell} - x^{N+1}}{1 - x^{N+1}}$$\nWe must make an assumption about $N$. A typical nucleosome wraps approximately $147\\,\\text{bp}$, so the maximum unwrapping from one end is $N \\approx 73\\,\\text{bp}$. We will see that $x < 1$, and thus for large $N$, the term $x^{N+1}$ becomes negligible. It is a standard and reasonable assumption in such models to treat the sum as if $N \\to \\infty$. In this limit, $x^{N+1} \\to 0$ (since $x<1$). The expression for the fraction simplifies considerably:\n$$f_{\\text{exposed}} \\approx \\frac{x^{\\ell}}{1} = x^{\\ell} = \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_G}{RT}\\right)\\right)^{\\ell} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_G \\ell}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{expose}}(\\ell)}{RT}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

Two such mechanisms are:\n\n$1$. **Nucleosome Occlusion**: The model assumes that motifs not bound by the TF are in a single \"unbound\" and accessible state. However, a fraction of these TF-unbound motifs may be occluded by nucleosomes. Nucleosomes strongly protect DNA from transposase cleavage. This protection in the core of TF-unbound motifs would lower the measured $\\lambda_c^{\\text{obs}}$, which the model would misinterpret as protection due to TF binding, thus inflating the estimated fraction $p$.\n\n$2$. **Intrinsic Transposase Sequence Aversion**: The model uses a single multiplicative factor, $\\beta$, to account for sequence bias, measured on naked DNA. The Tn$5$ transposase has complex sequence preferences. If the specific sequence of the motif core is intrinsically highly disfavored for cleavage, creating a \"cold spot\" that is deeper than what is captured by the average factor $\\beta$, the observed $\\lambda_c^{\\text{obs}}$ will be lower than expected for the unbound state. This intrinsic lack of cutting is again misattributed to TF-mediated protection, leading to an overestimation of $p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.500}\n$$", "id": "2959373"}]}
