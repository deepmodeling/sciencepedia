This practice focuses on the critical first step: designing a robust quantitative experiment.

You will include synthetic ribonucleic acid (RNA) spike-ins with known m6A stoichiometry to calibrate immunoprecipitation (IP) efficiency and correct batch effects. Start from the following foundational bases: (i) the Central Dogma of molecular biology (DNA to RNA to protein), (ii) immunochemical binding is governed by mass action such that capture depends on epitope abundance, and (iii) in high-throughput sequencing, read counts for a species are, to first order, proportional to the number of molecules entering the library multiplied by step-specific capture efficiencies and library size factors.

Then convert these normalized ratios to transcripts per million (TPM) to address length effects before cross-batch comparison.\n\nSelect the best option.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically valid. It presents a well-defined and critical problem in the quantitative analysis of epitranscriptomic data derived from methylated ribonucleic acid immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq). The goal is to establish a robust methodology for calibrating immunoprecipitation (IP) efficiency and correcting for batch effects to allow for comparable estimates of $N^6$-methyladenosine ($m^6A$) stoichiometry across different experiments. The provided assumptions—non-saturating antibody binding, non-specific background, and processing variability—are realistic and central to the challenge. The foundational principles are correct and relevant.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the stoichiometry, $f_g$, for an endogenous transcript $g$. This is the fraction of molecules of transcript $g$ that are methylated. The signal measured in a MeRIP-seq experiment for a given transcript depends on both its total abundance, $T_g$, and its stoichiometry, $f_g$. A robust method must deconvolve these two factors and also account for experimental artifacts.\n\nLet $C_{g, \\text{input}}$ and $C_{g, \\text{IP}}$ be the normalized read counts for transcript $g$ in the input and IP libraries, respectively. The input count is proportional to the total abundance of the transcript:\n$$C_{g, \\text{input}} \\propto T_g$$\nThe IP count is proportional to the amount of transcript pulled down. Under the assumption of non-saturating binding and modest non-specific background, the amount of captured transcript $g$ is a linear function of its stoichiometry $f_g$. The capture is a sum of specific binding to methylated molecules (proportional to $f_g T_g$) and non-specific binding to all molecules (proportional to $T_g$). Thus:\n$$C_{g, \\text{IP}} \\propto \\beta_b (f_g T_g) + \\alpha_b T_g = T_g(\\alpha_b + \\beta_b f_g)$$\nwhere $\\beta_b$ is the batch-specific efficiency of specific capture by the antibody and $\\alpha_b$ is the batch-specific efficiency of non-specific background binding.\n\nTo isolate the effect of methylation from that of abundance, we compute the enrichment ratio, $E_g^{(b)}$:\n$$E_g^{(b)} = \\frac{C_{g, \\text{IP}}^{(b)}}{C_{g, \\text{input}}^{(b)}} \\propto \\frac{T_g(\\alpha_b + \\beta_b f_g)}{T_g} = \\alpha_b + \\beta_b f_g$$\nThis equation shows that the measured enrichment for a transcript is linearly dependent on its true stoichiometry. The challenge is that $\\alpha_b$ and $\\beta_b$ are unknown and vary by batch $b$. To solve for the stoichiometry of an endogenous transcript, $f_g$, one must first determine the parameters $\\alpha_b$ and $\\beta_b$ for that specific batch. This requires a calibration curve using standards with known stoichiometries.\n\nA robust calibration strategy must:\n1.  Use multiple standards (spike-ins) with known stoichiometries, $f_i$, to allow for the fitting of a line and determination of the two parameters $\\alpha_b$ and $\\beta_b$.\n2.  Have these standards span a wide range of stoichiometries (e.g., from $0$ to $1.0$).\n3.  Ensure the standards are processed identically to the endogenous RNA by adding them to the total RNA pool before any enzymatic or physical processing (e.g., fragmentation, IP).\n4.  Calculate the IP-over-input enrichment ratio to normalize for transcript abundance.\n5.  Use the derived calibration curve, $E^{(b)} = \\alpha_b + \\beta_b f$, to convert the measured enrichment of an endogenous transcript, $E_g^{(b)}$, into an estimate of its absolute stoichiometry, $\\hat{f}_g^{(b)} = (E_g^{(b)} - \\alpha_b) / \\beta_b$. These absolute stoichiometry values are then directly comparable across all batches.\n\nWith these principles, we evaluate the options.\n\nA. Add a single fully methylated synthetic RNA spike-in to each IP reaction at a fixed amount, and normalize all IP read counts by the IP read count of this spike-in. Use the resulting scaled IP counts directly to compare methylation across batches.\nThis strategy is invalid. First, it uses only a single spike-in with stoichiometry $f=1.0$. This provides only one point on the calibration curve, making it impossible to solve for both the intercept $\\alpha_b$ (non-specific binding) and the slope $\\beta_b$ (specific IP efficiency). Second, it normalizes IP counts by another IP count, failing to use an input control. This means the resulting \"scaled IP counts\" are confounded by the initial abundance of the transcript, $T_g$. It cannot distinguish a highly abundant, lowly methylated transcript from a lowly abundant, highly methylated one.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. Add a panel of synthetic RNAs that are sequence- and length-matched but differ only in their known $m^6A$ stoichiometry spanning values such as $0$, $0.25$, $0.5$, and $1.0$ ... Introduce the same equimolar mixture into the total RNA before any processing, then split the sample to generate input and IP libraries ... For each batch $b$, compute for each spike-in $i$ the enrichment ratio $E_{i}^{(b)}$ ... fit a linear calibration $E_{i}^{(b)}=\\alpha_{b}+\\beta_{b} f_{i}$ ... and invert this relationship to estimate per-transcript stoichiometry $\\hat{f}_{g}^{(b)}=(E_{g}^{(b)}-\\alpha_{b})/\\beta_{b}$.\nThis strategy is excellent and directly follows the principles for a robust experiment outlined above. It uses a panel of spike-ins with a range of stoichiometries, including $0$, which is critical for estimating the non-specific binding intercept $\\alpha_b$. Adding the spike-ins to the total RNA before processing ensures they serve as true tracers for the entire workflow. It correctly uses the IP/input enrichment ratio to control for abundance. Finally, it uses the resulting calibration curve to calculate an absolute stoichiometry, $\\hat{f}_{g}^{(b)}$, for each endogenous transcript. These absolute values are inherently comparable across batches, directly solving the problem.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Add double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligonucleotide spike-ins carrying N6-methyladenine modifications at varying fractions into the IP reaction immediately before antibody incubation, and use their recovery to model RNA IP efficiency.\nThis strategy is fundamentally flawed. The calibrant must be chemically and physically as similar to the analyte as possible. Here, double-stranded DNA is proposed as a calibrant for an experiment measuring modified single-stranded RNA. An antibody raised against $m^6A$ in RNA will likely have different binding characteristics (affinity, specificity) for N6-methyladenine in DNA, especially double-stranded DNA where the base is internal to a helix. Furthermore, adding the spike-in immediately before IP bypasses critical upstream steps like fragmentation, whose efficiencies can also introduce batch variability. The calibrant must trace the entire process.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Add unmethylated External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) RNA spike-ins to each sample after immunoprecipitation but before library preparation to control for sequencing depth, and normalize IP read counts by ERCC counts for cross-batch comparison.\nThis strategy is inadequate. First, the spike-ins are unmethylated. They cannot be used to calibrate the efficiency of the methylation-specific immunoprecipitation. They can, at best, provide information about non-specific binding, but not the specific capture efficiency $\\beta_b$. Second, they are added *after* the IP step. Therefore, they cannot be used to normalize for variability in IP efficiency, which is the primary source of batch effects the problem seeks to correct. They only control for downstream steps like library preparation and sequencing.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Add a single $0.5$ stoichiometry synthetic RNA spike-in to total RNA and normalize all IP to input ratios for endogenous transcripts by the spike-in’s IP to input ratio. Then convert these normalized ratios to transcripts per million (TPM) to address length effects before cross-batch comparison.\nThis strategy is an improvement over A but still insufficient. It correctly adds the spike-in to total RNA and uses the IP/input ratio. However, like option A, it relies on a single-point calibration (a spike-in with $f=0.5$). With only one point, it is impossible to uniquely determine both $\\alpha_b$ and $\\beta_b$. Normalizing the enrichment of all genes by the enrichment of this single spike-in, i.e., calculating $E_g / E_{\\text{spike}}$, does not yield a value directly proportional to stoichiometry if the non-specific binding term $\\alpha_b$ is non-zero, as stated in the problem. The method implicitly assumes $\\alpha_b = 0$, which is an invalid assumption. The mention of TPM is a distraction from this central flaw.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2943761"}, {"introduction": "The N6-methyladenosine ($m^6A$) modification often has complex effects, simultaneously influencing both the stability of an mRNA and the rate at which it is translated into protein.

You should explicitly orthogonalize the decay process using a $3'$ untranslated region ($3'$ UTR) module so that any remaining difference in protein yield per mRNA reflects translation rather than stability.\n\nYou build two otherwise identical reporters that differ only in the presence or absence of m6A consensus sites in the coding sequence: a wild-type reporter with intact RRACH motifs that can be methylated when the methyltransferase-like $3$ (METTL$3$) writer is present, and a mutant reporter in which RRACH motifs are silently mutated to prevent methylation without altering the encoded protein.

It is based on the central dogma of molecular biology and steady-state kinetic models, which are standard frameworks for analyzing gene expression. The experimental design utilizes the MS2-CP tethering system, a well-established technique for manipulating mRNA fate, to create an orthogonal control over decay. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient data and explicit assumptions ($\\alpha_{WT} = \\alpha_{MUT}$, $d_{P,WT} = d_{P,MUT}$) to allow for a unique, logical solution. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no internal contradictions, unrealistic premises, or fallacies. The problem is a valid and rigorous exercise in experimental design and data interpretation in molecular biology.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Analysis\nThe objective is to separate the effect of m6A on the translation rate constant, $k_{TL}$, from its effect on the mRNA decay rate constant, $d_M$.\n\nFrom the steady-state protein abundance equation $P = (k_{TL}/d_P) \\times M$, we can derive a metric for translation efficiency. By rearranging, we get:\n$$ \\frac{P}{M} = \\frac{k_{TL}}{d_P} $$\nSince the problem states that the protein degradation rate, $d_P$, is identical for both reporters, the ratio of protein to mRNA abundance ($P/M$) is directly proportional to the translation rate constant, $k_{TL}$.\n$$ \\frac{P}{M} \\propto k_{TL} $$\nTherefore, by calculating and comparing this ratio for the m6A-capable and m6A-deficient reporters, we can directly compare their relative translation efficiencies.\n\nFrom the steady-state mRNA abundance equation $M = \\alpha/d_M$, and given that the transcription rate, $\\alpha$, is identical for both reporters, mRNA abundance is inversely proportional to the mRNA decay rate.\n$$ M \\propto \\frac{1}{d_M} $$\nTherefore, a lower steady-state mRNA level implies a higher decay rate (i.e., lower stability).\n\nLet us analyze the provided data for each condition:\n\n**Condition 1: Baseline (MS2-CP only, METTL$3$ present)**\nThis condition reflects the combined, unperturbed effects of m6A.\n- For the m6A-capable (WT) reporter: $M_{WT} = 80$, $P_{WT} = 3600$. The protein-per-mRNA ratio is $(P/M)_{WT} = 3600 / 80 = 45$ a.u.\n- For the m6A-deficient (MUT) reporter: $M_{MUT} = 120$, $P_{MUT} = 4200$. The protein-per-mRNA ratio is $(P/M)_{MUT} = 4200 / 120 = 35$ a.u.\n- **Stability Analysis:** We observe $M_{WT} < M_{MUT}$ ($80 < 120$). Since $\\alpha$ is constant, this implies $d_{M,WT} > d_{M,MUT}$. This indicates that the presence of m6A-competent sites leads to mRNA destabilization.\n- **Translation Analysis:** We observe $(P/M)_{WT} > (P/M)_{MUT}$ ($45 > 35$). This suggests that m6A enhances the translation efficiency.\n\n**Condition 2: Forced Decay (MS2-CP-CNOT$7$, METTL$3$ present)**\nThis is the key experimental condition designed to isolate the effect on translation. By tethering the CNOT$7$ deadenylase to the $3'$ UTR of both reporters, a dominant and matched decay pathway is imposed, effectively \"clamping\" the decay rates to be equal: $d_{M,WT} \\approx d_{M,MUT}$.\n- The data shows that indeed, $M_{WT} = M_{MUT} = 50$ a.u., confirming that the mRNA decay rates have been successfully equalized.\n- Now, we compare the protein output under these decay-controlled conditions.\n- For WT: $M_{WT} = 50$, $P_{WT} = 2250$. The protein-per-mRNA ratio is $(P/M)_{WT} = 2250 / 50 = 45$ a.u.\n- For MUT: $M_{MUT} = 50$, $P_{MUT} = 1750$. The protein-per-mRNA ratio is $(P/M)_{MUT} = 1750 / 50 = 35$ a.u.\n- **Translation Analysis:** With stability effects neutralized, we still observe $(P/M)_{WT} > (P/M)_{MUT}$ ($45 > 35$). This provides unambiguous evidence that m6A enhances translation efficiency, independent of its effect on mRNA stability. The ratio of the translation rates is $k_{TL,WT}/k_{TL,MUT} = 45/35 \\approx 1.286$.\n\n**Condition 3: Negative Control (MS2-CP-CNOT$7$, METTL$3$ knockdown)**\nThis condition serves to confirm that the observed effects are dependent on m6A methylation. Knockdown of the writer enzyme METTL$3$ should prevent m6A formation, making the WT reporter functionally equivalent to the MUT reporter.\n- For WT: $M_{WT} = 50$, $P_{WT} = 1750$. The ratio is $(P/M)_{WT} = 1750 / 50 = 35$ a.u.\n- For MUT: $M_{MUT} = 50$, $P_{MUT}= 1750$. The ratio is $(P/M)_{MUT} = 1750 / 50 = 35$ a.u.\n- **Analysis:** Upon METTL$3$ knockdown, $(P/M)_{WT} = (P/M)_{MUT}$. The translational advantage of the WT reporter is abolished. This confirms that the enhanced translation observed in Condition $2$ is indeed mediated by m6A.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n1.  m6A decreases mRNA stability (promotes decay), as shown by lower mRNA levels in Condition $1$.\n2.  m6A increases translation efficiency, as shown by a higher protein-per-mRNA ratio in Condition $2$, where stability is controlled.\n3.  These effects are m6A-dependent, as confirmed by their loss upon METTL$3$ knockdown in Condition $3$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Use $12\\times$ MS2 hairpins in the shared $3'$ UTR of both reporters and co-express MS2-CP–CNOT$7$ to impose a matched, dominant decay. Compute protein per mRNA for each reporter as a proxy for translation. Because protein per mRNA is higher for the m6A-capable reporter under decay control (for METTL$3$ present, $2250/50$ versus $1750/50$), conclude that m6A increases translation efficiency, while the reduced mRNA at baseline without forced decay (m6A-capable $80$ versus m6A-deficient $120$) indicates a concurrent destabilizing effect. Loss of the translation advantage upon METTL$3$ knockdown confirms m6A dependence.**\nThis option correctly describes the experimental design for orthogonal decay control. It correctly identifies the protein-per-mRNA ratio as the proper metric for translation. It correctly computes this ratio from the Condition $2$ data ($45$ vs. $35$). It correctly concludes that m6A enhances translation. It also correctly interprets the Condition $1$ data ($M=80$ vs. $M=120$) as evidence for m6A-mediated destabilization. Finally, it correctly uses the METTL$3$ knockdown data from Condition $3$ to confirm m6A dependence. This statement aligns perfectly with our rigorous derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Insert AU-rich elements only in the m6A-deficient reporter to equalize decay, then compare total protein output between reporters. Because the m6A-capable reporter produces less protein without any normalization, conclude that m6A primarily represses translation.**\nThis option proposes a flawed experimental design. Using AU-rich elements is not a reliable method for matching decay rates precisely and dominantly. Furthermore, comparing total protein output ($P$) without normalizing to mRNA levels ($M$) conflates stability and translation effects, defeating the purpose of the experiment. The conclusion that m6A represses translation is incorrect; it is based on total protein output ($3600 < 4200$), which is dominated by the stability effect, and ignores the higher translation efficiency ($45 > 35$) evident from the protein-per-mRNA ratio.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Equalize translation by tethering a $5'$ UTR repressor (eIF$4$E-binding protein) to both reporters, then quantify mRNA half-lives after transcriptional shutoff with actinomycin D. Because the m6A-capable reporter shows a longer half-life under these conditions, conclude that m6A stabilizes mRNA and has no effect on translation.**\nThis option describes an experiment to measure stability, not translation. The premise that one should equalize translation to measure stability is valid in principle, but the conclusions drawn are factually wrong based on the provided data. The assertion that the m6A-capable reporter shows a *longer* half-life (is more stable) contradicts the data from Condition $1$ ($M_{WT} < M_{MUT}$), which implies a *shorter* half-life. The conclusion that m6A has no effect on translation is also directly contradicted by our analysis of the $P/M$ ratios.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Use different promoters to match steady-state mRNA abundances between reporters, then quantify protein per total RNA in the cell. Because protein per total RNA is similar across conditions, conclude that m6A has negligible effects on both translation and stability.**\nThis is a fundamentally flawed experimental design. Using different promoters violates the critical assumption of matched transcription rates ($\\alpha_{WT} \\neq \\alpha_{MUT}$), making any subsequent comparison of protein levels uninterpretable. Normalizing reporter protein to total cellular RNA is an inappropriate and noisy metric. The conclusion that m6A has negligible effects is demonstrably false according to our analysis of the provided data, which clearly show significant, opposing effects on stability and translation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2943715"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of many molecular biology studies is to move beyond correlation and establish a direct causal link between a molecular feature and a biological phenotype.

Include controls: MCP alone, MCP–catalytically dead METTL$3$ (DPPW $\\to$ APPA), hairpin-deleted transcript, and tethering to an unrelated transcript; perform all rescues in a METTL$3$ knockout background to keep global methylation low. Assess rescue of site-specific m$6$A (SELECT) and proliferation phenotype, and verify that global m$6$A levels remain unchanged.\n\nB. Introduce a synonymous mutation that leaves the DRACH motif intact but alters a neighboring nucleotide outside the $5$-mer, then globally overexpress full-length METTL$3$ and METTL$14$ to elevate m$6$A. Confirm increased total cellular m$6$A by dot blot, and measure proliferation. Do not use any tethering system; assume that global upregulation will restore methylation at the site of interest.\n\nC. Eliminate the site by mutating the methyl-acceptor adenosine to guanosine in the coding sequence, then rescue the phenotype by tethering reader protein YT$521$-B homology domain family protein $1$ (YTHDF$1$) via MS$2$ hairpins placed in the $5^{\\prime}$ UTR. Confirm restored proliferation and interpret this as specific evidence that the original m$6$A site was causal.\n\nD. Use a luciferase reporter bearing the wild-type $3^{\\prime}$ UTR of transcript T to observe a proliferation-associated readout in transfected cells. Disrupt the DRACH motif in the reporter by nonsynonymous mutation to remove the adenosine, and attempt rescue by co-expressing excess full-length METTL$3$ without any tether or site-specific validation. Verify only bulk m$6$A and conclude site specificity from changes in reporter signal.\n\nE. Create an endogenous synonymous DRACH-disrupting edit in transcript T and validate specific loss of m$6$A by SELECT. For rescue, insert MS$2$ hairpins $> 500$ nucleotides away from the site and tether catalytically dead METTL$3$; interpret any observed partial phenotypic normalization as methylation-independent scaffold rescue and attribute causality to the original site.\n\nChoose the best option.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most rigorous experimental design to establish a causal link between a single N$6$-methyladenosine (m$6$A) site on a specific transcript, T, and a cell proliferation phenotype. The strategy must be a \"loss-and-rescue\" experiment that isolates the effect of this single modification from global m$6$A changes and other potential confounders.\n\nBefore evaluating the options, a correct experimental design must be established based on the provided principles.\n1.  **Loss of Function**: The m$6$A site must be eliminated without altering the protein product of transcript T. The problem states the site is within the coding sequence (CDS) and resides in a DRACH motif (D=A/G/U, R=A/G, A=methylated base, C, H=A/C/U). The principle of codon degeneracy allows for a synonymous mutation. This mutation should change a nucleotide in the DRACH motif (i.e., the D, R, or H position) to a non-consensus base, thereby ablating the recognition site for the endogenous METTL$3$–METTL$14$ methyltransferase complex. This must be performed at the endogenous genomic locus to maintain native gene expression context. It is also critical to verify that the protein level remains unchanged and that the mutation does not significantly alter the local mRNA secondary structure, which could be a confounder.\n2.  **Rescue of Function**: Methylation must be restored specifically at the target site. Since the endogenous recognition motif is disrupted, the writer complex must be artificially recruited. A common and effective method is the MS$2$-MCP tethering system. This involves inserting MS$2$ stem-loop hairpins into the target transcript (T) near the site of the original modification. A fusion protein consisting of the MS$2$ coat protein (MCP) and the catalytically active domain of the m$6$A writer (METTL$3$, often with METTL$14$ for stability and activity) is then expressed. This fusion protein binds to the MS$2$ hairpins, bringing the methyltransferase into close proximity to the target adenosine, leading to its methylation.\n3.  **Controls and Background**: The entire experiment must be performed in a genetic background where the endogenous writer complex is inactive (e.g., a METTL$3$ knockout or knockdown cell line). This ensures that any observed rescue is due solely to the tethered enzyme and not the residual activity of the endogenous machinery. A comprehensive set of controls is mandatory:\n    *   **Catalytic Activity Control**: Tethering a catalytically dead version of the writer (e.g., METTL$3$ with a DPPW $\\to$ APPA mutation) to distinguish between effects of methylation and non-specific effects of protein binding (scaffolding).\n    *   **Tethering System Control**: Expressing MCP alone (without the fused enzyme) to control for effects of tethering a protein to the mRNA.\n    *   **Hairpin Control**: Using the edited transcript without the MS$2$ hairpins to control for any effects of the hairpins themselves.\n4.  **Validation**: Every step must be meticulously verified.\n    *   The genomic edit must be confirmed by sequencing.\n    *   The loss and subsequent rescue of site-specific m$6$A must be quantified using a single-nucleotide resolution method, such as SELECT (single-base elongation- and ligation-based quantitative PCR) or miCLIP. Bulk methods like dot blots are insufficient.\n    *   Global m$6$A levels should be measured to confirm they are not altered by the site-specific rescue.\n    *   The cellular phenotype (proliferation) must be quantified in all conditions.\n\nWith these criteria for a rigorous design, we will evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A: Evaluation**\nThis option proposes a design that aligns perfectly with the established criteria.\n*   **Loss of Function**: It uses a CRISPR cytidine base editor for a synonymous mutation to disrupt the DRACH motif at the endogenous locus. This is a precise and modern technique. It correctly prioritizes preserving the amino acid sequence and checking for minimal impact on local RNA structure.\n*   **Validation of Loss**: It specifies using SELECT and meRIP-qPCR to validate the loss of methylation at the specific site, which are appropriate and quantitative methods.\n*   **Rescue of Function**: It employs the MS$2$-MCP tethering system. The hairpins are placed in the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR near the site, a standard and effective location. The fusion protein is correctly designed: MCP fused to the catalytically active METTL$3$ domain and METTL$14$ dimerization interface, ensuring a functional writer complex is recruited.\n*   **Controls and Background**: The design is exemplary in its inclusion of controls. It includes MCP alone, a catalytically dead METTL$3$ fusion (the canonical DPPW $\\to$ APPA mutant), a hairpin-deleted transcript, and a control for off-target effects (tethering to an unrelated transcript). Crucially, it specifies that all rescues are performed in a METTL$3$ knockout background to eliminate confounding variables from endogenous writer activity.\n*   **Validation of Rescue**: It includes assessment of site-specific m$6$A restoration (SELECT), the proliferation phenotype, and global m$6$A levels.\n\nThis design is comprehensive, rigorous, and directly addresses the scientific question with the necessary specificity and controls.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: Evaluation**\nThis option has several fundamental flaws.\n*   **Loss of Function**: It proposes a synonymous mutation *outside* the $5$-mer DRACH motif. This is unlikely to disrupt methylation efficiently, if at all. The very premise of the loss-of-function step is flawed.\n*   **Rescue of Function**: It suggests global overexpression of full-length METTL$3$ and METTL$14$. This is a non-specific approach that would increase m$6$A levels on thousands of transcripts, making it impossible to attribute any change in proliferation to the single site on transcript T. This directly contradicts the goal of the experiment.\n*   **Validation**: It relies on a dot blot, which measures total cellular m$6$A and provides no site-specific information.\n\nThis experimental design is poorly conceived and cannot answer the question of single-site causality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C: Evaluation**\nThis option is based on profound misunderstandings of the biological system.\n*   **Loss of Function**: It proposes mutating the methyl-acceptor adenosine (A) to a guanosine (G). This is a *non-synonymous* mutation that will alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Any resulting phenotypic change cannot be unambiguously attributed to the loss of m$6$A, as it could be caused by the altered protein function. This is a critical experimental confounder.\n*   **Rescue of Function**: It proposes tethering YTHDF$1$, which is an m$6$A *reader* protein, not a *writer*. A reader protein binds to m$6$A but cannot create it. Tethering a reader to a site where the methylatable adenosine has been removed (A$\\to$G) is a nonsensical rescue strategy.\n\nThis design is flawed at both the loss-of-function and rescue steps.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D: Evaluation**\nThis option is flawed in its setup, execution, and validation.\n*   **Experimental System**: It uses a luciferase reporter containing only the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR of transcript T. The problem states the m$6$A site is in the *coding sequence* (CDS). Therefore, this reporter system is entirely irrelevant to the site in question.\n*   **Loss of Function**: It proposes a *nonsynonymous* mutation, introducing the same protein-level confounder as in option C.\n*   **Rescue of Function**: It uses global overexpression of METTL$3$, which, as explained for option B, is non-specific and inappropriate for testing single-site causality.\n*   **Validation**: It relies on bulk m$6$A measurement and reporter signal, neither of which provides direct, specific evidence about the endogenous transcript's site.\n\nThis design fails to test the hypothesis in the correct biological context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: Evaluation**\nThis option describes a control experiment, not a complete rescue experiment, and has design flaws.\n*   **Rescue of Function**: It proposes tethering a *catalytically dead* METTL$3$. This is a necessary *control* to show that catalytic activity is required for the phenotype, but it is not a rescue. A proper rescue experiment must use a catalytically *active* enzyme to restore the modification and the phenotype. Interpreting \"partial phenotypic normalization\" from a dead enzyme is speculative and insufficient to prove causality.\n*   **Design Flaw**: It suggests placing the MS$2$ hairpins more than $500$ nucleotides away from the site. The efficiency of tethering-mediated enzymatic activity is highly distance-dependent, and this large separation is very likely to render the system ineffective, leading to a false-negative result.\n\nThis option misinterprets the role of a crucial control and contains a poor design choice that jeopardizes the experiment's success.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A is the only design that is scientifically sound, rigorous, and incorporates all the necessary components for a conclusive loss-and-rescue experiment to test the causality of a single m$6$A site. It correctly uses a synonymous edit, a specific tethering system for rescue in a clean genetic background, a comprehensive set of controls, and appropriate validation methods.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2943638"}]}
