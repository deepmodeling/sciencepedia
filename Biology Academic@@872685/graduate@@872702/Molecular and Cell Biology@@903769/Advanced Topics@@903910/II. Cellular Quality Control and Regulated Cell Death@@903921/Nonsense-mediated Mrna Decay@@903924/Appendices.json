During the first round of translation, ribosomes remove EJCs they physically traverse. If translation terminates at a premature termination codon (PTC) while one or more EJCs remain bound downstream on the mRNA, the mRNA is recognized by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway and degraded. If translation terminates in the last exon (i.e., with no exon–exon junctions downstream), or if the terminating ribosome has already removed the only potential downstream EJC, NMD is typically not triggered in mammalian cells with otherwise typical 3' untranslated region (UTR) architecture.\n\nConsider a human gene, TXR, whose canonical protein-coding transcript comprises $10$ exons and a typical-length 3' UTR. The last exon is exon $10$, and the last exon–exon junction is between exons $9$ and $10$. Assume EJCs are deposited at approximately $24$ nucleotides upstream of junctions and that ribosomes displace EJCs they pass before encountering a stop codon. Four alleles introducing PTCs are identified:\n\n- Allele $1$: A nonsense variant in exon $10$ (the last exon), positioned $400$ nucleotides downstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction within the coding sequence of exon $10$.\n- Allele $2$: A nonsense variant in exon $9$ located $70$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction.\n- Allele $3$: A frameshift in exon $9$ that creates a PTC located $20$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction.\n- Allele $4$: A nonsense variant in exon $2$, far upstream of the last exon–exon junctions.\n\nFrom the mechanistic basis above, reason which alleles are most likely to escape NMD versus be degraded by NMD, and select the option that both correctly classifies the alleles and most appropriately states the high-level implication for variant interpretation in a dosage-sensitive (haploinsufficient) disease gene.\n\nA. Alleles $1$ and $3$ are likely to escape NMD; alleles $2$ and $4$ are likely NMD substrates.

All four alleles escape NMD because any premature termination leads to truncation without decay; dominant-negative mechanisms should be considered for all.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The system is a eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) from a multi-exon gene.\n- Splicing deposits Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs) approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of each exon–exon junction. For the purpose of this problem, the EJC deposition site is assumed to be approximately $24$ nucleotides upstream of a junction.\n- During the first round of translation, ribosomes remove EJCs they traverse.\n- The condition for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is the termination of translation at a premature termination codon (PTC) while one or more EJCs remain bound downstream on the mRNA.\n- The conditions for escaping NMD are: ($1$) translation terminates in the last exon, or ($2$) the terminating ribosome has already removed the only potential downstream EJC.\n- The gene in question, `TXR`, has a canonical transcript with $10$ exons and a typical 3' untranslated region (UTR).\n- The last exon is exon $10$.\n- The last exon–exon junction is between exon $9$ and exon $10$.\n- Four alleles with PTCs are described:\n    - Allele $1$: PTC in exon $10$, located $400$ nucleotides downstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction.\n    - Allele $2$: PTC in exon $9$, located $70$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction.\n    - Allele $3$: PTC in exon $9$, located $20$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction.\n    - Allele $4$: PTC in exon $2$, located far upstream of the last exon–exon junction.\n\nThe task is to determine which alleles are subject to NMD and which escape, and to state the implication for variant interpretation in a haploinsufficient disease gene.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The description of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay mechanism, involving PTCs, EJCs, ribosome clearance, and the specific rules for triggering or evading decay, is a correct and standard representation of this fundamental process in molecular and cell biology. The values provided, such as the EJC position ($\\sim20$-$24$ nucleotides), are consistent with established literature. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem defines a clear set of rules and provides four distinct scenarios (alleles) to apply these rules. The locations of the PTCs and the EJC are specified with sufficient precision to allow for a unique determination of the outcome (NMD or escape) for each allele. The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe central principle is that NMD is triggered if and only if translation terminates at a PTC, leaving at least one EJC downstream on the mRNA. The `TXR` gene has $10$ exons, which means there are $9$ exon-exon junctions and, consequently, $9$ EJCs are deposited during splicing. The final EJC is deposited approximately $24$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction.\n\nWe will analyze each allele based on the provided mechanistic rules.\n\n**Allele 1 Analysis**:\nThe PTC is located in exon $10$. Exon $10$ is the last exon. The problem explicitly states that \"If translation terminates in the last exon... NMD is typically not triggered\". This rule is based on the fact that there are no exon-exon junctions, and thus no EJCs, downstream of the last exon. Therefore, termination in exon $10$ cannot leave a downstream EJC.\n**Conclusion for Allele 1**: Escapes NMD. A truncated protein is produced.\n\n**Allele 2 Analysis**:\nThe PTC is in exon $9$, located $70$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction. The last EJC is deposited approximately $24$ nucleotides upstream of this same junction. The translating ribosome moves along the mRNA. The ribosome will encounter the PTC at position `(Junction site) - 70 nt`. The last EJC is located at position `(Junction site) - 24 nt`. Since the ribosome terminates at a position upstream of the EJC, it does not displace this EJC. This EJC remains on the mRNA, downstream of the PTC. According to the core principle, the presence of a downstream EJC triggers NMD.\n**Conclusion for Allele 2**: Is a substrate for NMD. The mRNA is degraded, and negligible protein is produced.\n\n**Allele 3 Analysis**:\nThe PTC is in exon $9$, located $20$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $9$–$10$ junction. The last EJC is deposited at approximately $24$ nucleotides upstream of this junction. The sequence of events for the ribosome is as follows: it first encounters and displaces the EJC at position `(Junction site) - 24 nt`, and then continues for $4$ more nucleotides before encountering the PTC at position `(Junction site) - 20 nt` and terminating. At the point of termination, the final EJC has already been removed. Since there are no other EJCs further downstream, no EJC remains on the mRNA. This scenario matches the escape condition: \"if the terminating ribosome has already removed the only potential downstream EJC, NMD is typically not triggered\".\n**Conclusion for Allele 3**: Escapes NMD. A truncated protein is produced.\n\n**Allele 4 Analysis**:\nThe PTC is in exon $2$, which is described as \"far upstream of the last exon–exon junctions\". When the ribosome terminates translation in exon $2$, all EJCs associated with the downstream junctions (exon $2$–$3$, exon $3$–$4$, ..., exon $9$–$10$) remain on the mRNA. The presence of multiple downstream EJCs is a potent trigger for NMD.\n**Conclusion for Allele 4**: Is a substrate for NMD. The mRNA is degraded, and negligible protein is produced.\n\n**Summary and Implications for Haploinsufficiency**:\n- **NMD Escape**: Alleles $1$ and $3$. These alleles will produce stable truncated proteins.\n- **NMD Substrates**: Alleles $2$ and $4$. These alleles will lead to mRNA degradation and are effectively null alleles, resulting in a loss of function (LoF).\n\nIn the context of a dosage-sensitive (haploinsufficient) disease gene, a $50\\%$ reduction in protein product is sufficient to cause disease.\n- **Alleles 2 and 4 (NMD substrates)** create null alleles. In a heterozygous state, this leads to a $50\\%$ reduction in the normal protein, which is the classic mechanism for haploinsufficiency. Thus, these variants strongly support a LoF mechanism.\n- **Alleles 1 and 3 (NMD escapees)** produce truncated proteins. While these proteins might be non-functional (also resulting in LoF), their presence means one must also consider other possibilities. The truncated protein could interfere with the function of the wild-type protein from the other allele (a dominant-negative effect) or acquire a new, toxic function (a gain-of-function effect). Therefore, for these alleles, a simple assumption of haploinsufficiency is insufficient; further evaluation is required.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Alleles $1$ and $3$ are likely to escape NMD; alleles $2$ and $4$ are likely NMD substrates. For interpretation, alleles $2$ and $4$ support loss-of-function via haploinsufficiency, whereas alleles $1$ and $3$ warrant evaluation for dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects because truncated protein is expected.**\n- This option's classification of alleles matches our derivation precisely.\n- The interpretation of the consequences for a haploinsufficient gene is also correct. NMD-targeted alleles ($2$, $4$) are classical LoF, while NMD-escaping alleles ($1$, $3$) produce a truncated protein which necessitates considering dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Alleles $1$, $2$, and $3$ are likely to escape NMD; only allele $4$ is an NMD substrate. For interpretation, only allele $4$ supports loss-of-function via haploinsufficiency; the others suggest dominant-negative risk.**\n- This option incorrectly claims that Allele $2$ escapes NMD. As derived, the PTC in Allele $2$ is upstream of the final EJC, which triggers NMD.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Only allele $1$ escapes NMD; alleles $2$, $3$, and $4$ are NMD substrates. For interpretation, alleles $2$–$4$ support loss-of-function via haploinsufficiency, while allele $1$ does not.**\n- This option incorrectly claims that Allele $3$ is an NMD substrate. As derived, the PTC in Allele $3$ is downstream of the final EJC, allowing the ribosome to clear it before termination, thus escaping NMD.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. All four alleles escape NMD because any premature termination leads to truncation without decay; dominant-negative mechanisms should be considered for all.**\n- This option incorrectly claims that Alleles $2$ and $4$ escape NMD. This fundamentally misunderstands the mechanism of NMD.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A is consistent with the principles of NMD laid out in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2957383"}, {"introduction": "While manual inspection is useful for individual genes, modern biology demands high-throughput analysis of entire transcriptomes.

Given a nonnegative threshold $d$, predict NMD by this rule if and only if there exists at least one downstream junction and $\\Delta \\ge d$.\n  2.

It requires the implementation of a deterministic model to classify messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms as NMD-sensitive or not based on a set of precise, formalizable rules. The definitions, constraints, and test cases are self-contained, consistent, and scientifically plausible as a simplified model. We will therefore proceed with a systematic solution.\n\nThe core of the task is to implement a function that evaluates NMD sensitivity for a given transcript. The inputs for each transcript are a list of exon lengths, the start position of the stop codon, and two numerical thresholds. The final prediction is a Boolean value derived from the logical disjunction (an 'OR' operation) of two intermediate rules: the Exon Junction Complex (EJC)-based rule and the long $3^{\\prime}$ UTR rule.\n\nLet us formalize the algorithm step by step for a single transcript, defined by the parameters $(\\text{exon\\_lengths}, s, d, U_{\\text{thr}})$, where $\\text{exon\\_lengths}$ is the list of exon lengths $(\\ell_1, \\ell_2, \\dots, \\ell_n)$, $s$ is the stop codon start position, $d$ is the EJC distance threshold, and $U_{\\text{thr}}$ is the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR length threshold.\n\nFirst, we must compute the necessary transcript features from the given exon lengths.\nThe total length of the spliced transcript, $L$, is the sum of the lengths of all its exons:\n$$L = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell_i$$\nThe locations of the exon-exon junctions, $J_i$, are the cumulative sums of the lengths of the preceding exons. For a transcript with $n$ exons, there are $n-1$ junctions. The position of the $i$-th junction is given by:\n$$J_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{i} \\ell_k \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$$\nIf $n=1$, the set of junctions is empty.\n\nWith these features computed, we evaluate the two NMD-inducing rules.\n\nThe first rule is the EJC-based rule. This rule is predicated on the hypothesis that a stop codon located sufficiently far upstream of an exon-exon junction will leave a downstream EJC, which in turn triggers NMD. The model quantifies this as follows:\n1.  Identify all junctions located downstream of the stop codon start position $s$. This is the set of junctions $\\{J_i \\mid J_i > s\\}$.\n2.  If this set of downstream junctions is empty (which occurs if the stop codon is in the final exon, or if the transcript consists of a single exon), the EJC-based rule is not triggered, and its outcome is false.\n3.  If there is at least one downstream junction, we calculate the distance from the stop codon start $s$ to each of these junctions. We are interested in the closest one. Let $\\Delta$ be the minimum of these distances:\n    $$\\Delta = \\min \\{J_i - s \\mid J_i > s\\}$$\n4.  The EJC-based rule is true if and only if $\\Delta$ is greater than or equal to the given threshold $d$. That is, the condition for this rule is `(Number of downstream junctions > 0) AND ($\\Delta \\ge d$)`.\n\nThe second rule is the long $3^{\\prime}$ UTR rule. This captures the observation that transcripts with unusually long $3^{\\prime}$ untranslated regions are often targeted by NMD.\n1.  First, we calculate the length of the $3^{\\prime}$ UTR, denoted as $U$. The stop codon occupies three nucleotides at positions $s$, $s+1$, and $s+2$. The $3^{\\prime}$ UTR comprises all nucleotides following the stop codon. Its length is therefore the total transcript length minus the coordinate of the final nucleotide of the stop codon:\n    $$U = L - (s + 2)$$\n2.  The long $3^{\\prime}$ UTR rule is true if and only if $U$ is greater than or equal to the specified threshold $U_{\\text{thr}}$. The condition is simply $U \\ge U_{\\text{thr}}$.\n\nFinally, the overall classification of the transcript as NMD-sensitive is determined by the logical disjunction of the outcomes of the two rules. A transcript is predicted to be sensitive to NMD if the EJC-based rule is true, or if the long $3^{\\prime}$ UTR rule is true, or if both are true.\n\nThis complete algorithm will be applied independently to each test case specified in the problem statement to produce the final vector of boolean classifications.

SLAM-Seq marks nascent ribonucleic acid (RNA) by metabolic incorporation of $4$-thiouridine ($4$-sU), followed by alkylation and detection as thymine-to-cytosine conversions during sequencing. The group intends to infer transcript-specific decay constants from the disappearance of labeled molecules after the label is removed. Assume that, over the short time window of the experiment, mRNA decay can be modeled as first-order kinetics with a transcript-specific rate constant, that NMD acts additively on top of basal decay for NMD targets, and that acute UPF1 depletion rapidly reduces the NMD-specific contribution without immediately altering transcription initiation for most genes. The goal is to choose an experimental design and an expected set of kinetic signatures that are jointly consistent with these assumptions and that isolate the effect of NMD on decay.\n\nWhich option best specifies an appropriate SLAM-Seq pulse–chase design and correctly predicts the kinetic signatures for bona fide NMD targets and matched non-targets under control versus acute UPF1 depletion?\n\nA. Use an auxin-inducible degron to acutely deplete UPF1, adding auxin approximately $30$–$60$ $\\mathrm{min}$ before labeling. Pulse-label both control and depleted cells with $4$-sU for $15$–$20$ $\\mathrm{min}$, then chase with excess unlabeled uridine and collect samples at $t = 0, 15, 30, 60,$ and $120$ $\\mathrm{min}$. For each transcript, use the decline of the labeled (thymine-to-cytosine–converted) read fraction over time to fit a first-order decay constant. Expect that bona fide NMD targets show a larger decay constant (shorter half-life) in control and a smaller decay constant (longer half-life) upon UPF1 depletion, consistent with removal of an NMD-specific component, whereas non-targets show no significant change. In this time window, changes in synthesis are negligible, so differences reflect decay.\n\nB. Label continuously with $4$-sU for $24$ $\\mathrm{h}$ without a chase, and at a single endpoint compare the thymine-to-cytosine read fraction between control and UPF1-depleted cells. Expect that under UPF1 depletion, bona fide NMD targets show a lower labeled fraction because stabilization allows unlabeled RNA to dilute the labeled pool, while non-targets are unchanged.\n\nC. Pulse-label for $5$ $\\mathrm{min}$, then add cycloheximide during the chase to arrest translation, thereby preventing cotranslational effects. Expect that NMD kinetics are unaffected by cycloheximide because NMD is translation independent; thus any stabilization observed upon UPF1 depletion directly reports the decay component removed by UPF1, whereas non-targets are unchanged.\n\nD. Omit pulse–chase and instead add actinomycin D to shut off transcription, then perform SLAM-Seq at $t = 0$ and $t = 120$ $\\mathrm{min}$. Expect that upon UPF1 depletion, bona fide NMD targets decay faster because UPF1 loss leads to accumulation of decay intermediates that are rapidly cleared, while non-targets are unchanged.", "solution": "The problem statement shall first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Objective**: Quantify the alteration in decay rates of nonsense-mediated messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) decay (NMD) targets upon acute depletion of Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1).\n- **Technique**: Thiol-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-Seq).\n- **Labeling Method**: Nascent RNA is metabolically labeled with $4$-thiouridine ($4$-sU).\n- **Detection Method**: Alkylated $4$-sU is detected as a thymine-to-cytosine (T>C) conversion during sequencing.\n- **Goal of Analysis**: Infer transcript-specific decay constants from the disappearance of labeled molecules after the label is removed (pulse-chase).\n- **Assumptions**:\n    1.  mRNA decay is modeled as a first-order kinetic process with a transcript-specific rate constant, $k$.\n    2.  NMD acts additively on top of basal decay for NMD targets. The total decay rate constant for an NMD target is $k_{total} = k_{basal} + k_{NMD}$.\n    3.  Acute UPF1 depletion rapidly reduces the NMD-specific contribution ($k_{NMD} \\rightarrow 0$).\n    4.  Acute UPF1 depletion does not immediately alter transcription initiation rates.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in modern molecular and cell biology. NMD is a major eukaryotic mRNA surveillance pathway, UPF1 is its central helicase, and SLAM-Seq is a contemporary and widely used technique for measuring RNA kinetics. The model of first-order decay is a standard and effective approximation for mRNA turnover. The additive model for decay rates ($k_{total} = k_{basal} + k_{NMD}$) is a common and reasonable hypothesis for dissecting pathway contributions.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear theoretical framework (the assumptions) and asks for an experimental design and expected result that are consistent with this framework. The goal to \"isolate the effect of NMD on decay\" is specific and achievable under the given assumptions.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, logically consistent, and well-posed. It directly addresses a valid research question using appropriate concepts and techniques. Therefore, the problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe dynamics of the concentration of a specific mRNA transcript, $M(t)$, are described by the first-order kinetic model:\n$$ \\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = S - kM(t) $$\nwhere $S$ is the zero-order synthesis rate and $k$ is the first-order decay rate constant. The half-life of the transcript is given by $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$.\n\nA pulse-chase experiment is designed to measure $k$ directly.\n1.  **Pulse**: Cells are exposed to a labeled precursor ($4$-sU) for a short duration. Newly synthesized RNA incorporates this label.\n2.  **Chase**: The labeled precursor is removed and replaced with a large excess of the corresponding unlabeled precursor (uridine). This effectively stops the synthesis of new labeled RNA molecules.\n\nDuring the chase phase, the amount of labeled RNA, denoted $M^*(t)$, is no longer being synthesized. Its concentration changes according to:\n$$ \\frac{dM^*(t)}{dt} = -k M^*(t) $$\nThe solution to this differential equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$ M^*(t) = M^*(0) e^{-kt} $$\nwhere $M^*(0)$ is the amount of labeled RNA at the start of the chase ($t=0$).\n\nBy measuring the amount of labeled RNA at various time points $t_i$ during the chase, one can determine $k$. In SLAM-Seq, the fraction of sequencing reads for a transcript that contain T>C conversions is proportional to $M^*(t)$. Therefore, by plotting the natural logarithm of this fraction against time, one obtains a line with a slope of $-k$.\n\nNow, we apply the assumptions about NMD:\n- **Control condition (functional NMD)**:\n    - For a bona fide NMD target: $k_{control} = k_{basal} + k_{NMD}$.\n    - For a non-target: $k_{control} = k_{basal}$.\n- **Acute UPF1 depletion (impaired NMD)**:\n    - For a bona fide NMD target: $k_{depleted} = k_{basal} + 0 = k_{basal}$.\n    - For a non-target: $k_{depleted} = k_{basal}$.\n\n**Predicted Kinetic Signature**:\n- **Bona Fide NMD Target**: Comparing the two conditions, we expect $k_{control} > k_{depleted}$, since $k_{NMD}$ is a positive contribution to decay. A larger decay constant means a shorter half-life. Thus, the NMD target transcript will be more stable (longer half-life, smaller decay constant) upon UPF1 depletion.\n- **Non-Target**: The decay rate is determined by $k_{basal}$ in both conditions. Thus, we expect no significant change in its decay constant: $k_{control} \\approx k_{depleted}$.\n\nAn appropriate experimental design must allow for the acute depletion of UPF1 without confounding secondary effects (like transcriptional adaptation) and employ a pulse-chase regimen to measure decay rates directly.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use an auxin-inducible degron to acutely deplete UPF1, adding auxin approximately $30$–$60$ $\\mathrm{min}$ before labeling. Pulse-label both control and depleted cells with $4$-sU for $15$–$20$ $\\mathrm{min}$, then chase with excess unlabeled uridine and collect samples at $t = 0, 15, 30, 60,$ and $120$ $\\mathrm{min}$. For each transcript, use the decline of the labeled (thymine-to-cytosine–converted) read fraction over time to fit a first-order decay constant. Expect that bona fide NMD targets show a larger decay constant (shorter half-life) in control and a smaller decay constant (longer half-life) upon UPF1 depletion, consistent with removal of an NMD-specific component, whereas non-targets show no significant change. In this time window, changes in synthesis are negligible, so differences reflect decay.**\n\n- **Experimental Design**: The use of an auxin-inducible degron system is an excellent method for achieving acute protein depletion, satisfying the problem's assumption. The SLAM-Seq pulse ($15$–$20$ $\\mathrm{min}$) and chase (up to $120$ $\\mathrm{min}$ with multiple time points) constitute a classic and appropriate design for measuring mRNA decay rates.\n- **Analysis**: Fitting the decline of the labeled fraction to determine a decay constant is the correct analytical procedure for pulse-chase data.\n- **Prediction**: The prediction that NMD targets will show a decreased decay constant (stabilization) upon UPF1 depletion while non-targets remain unchanged is precisely what our derivation concluded. The prediction correctly links a larger $k$ to a shorter half-life and a smaller $k$ to a longer half-life.\n- **Verdict**: This option presents a methodologically sound experiment and a correct prediction based on the provided scientific model. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Label continuously with $4$-sU for $24$ $\\mathrm{h}$ without a chase, and at a single endpoint compare the thymine-to-cytosine read fraction between control and UPF1-depleted cells. Expect that under UPF1 depletion, bona fide NMD targets show a lower labeled fraction because stabilization allows unlabeled RNA to dilute the labeled pool, while non-targets are unchanged.**\n\n- **Experimental Design**: This is a continuous-labeling experiment, not a pulse-chase. It does not directly measure the decay rate constant $k$. It measures a steady-state property that depends on both synthesis ($S$) and decay ($k$). The primary goal of quantifying decay rates is not met by this design.\n- **Prediction**: The prediction is flawed. For an NMD target, UPF1 depletion decreases $k$. In a labeling experiment, the amount of labeled RNA accumulates over time. A slower decay (smaller $k$) would lead to higher accumulation of labeled RNA, not lower. The reasoning about dilution is confused; stabilization increases the total pool size, but it also increases the residence time of labeled molecules, which should increase, not decrease, the labeled fraction at a given time point, all else being equal.\n- **Verdict**: The experimental design is inappropriate for the stated goal, and the prediction is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Pulse-label for $5$ $\\mathrm{min}$, then add cycloheximide during the chase to arrest translation, thereby preventing cotranslational effects. Expect that NMD kinetics are unaffected by cycloheximide because NMD is translation independent; thus any stabilization observed upon UPF1 depletion directly reports the decay component removed by UPF1, whereas non-targets are unchanged.**\n\n- **Scientific Premise**: This option is based on a critical factual error. NMD is intrinsically **translation-dependent**. The surveillance complex recognizes a premature termination codon (PTC) during the pioneer round of translation. By arresting translation with cycloheximide, one blocks the NMD pathway itself.\n- **Experimental Consequence**: Adding cycloheximide would inhibit NMD in both the control and UPF1-depleted cells, masking the specific effect of UPF1 loss. The experiment would fail to isolate the NMD-specific decay component as both conditions would show NMD inhibition.\n- **Verdict**: The fundamental premise that NMD is translation-independent is false, rendering the entire experimental logic invalid. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Omit pulse–chase and instead add actinomycin D to shut off transcription, then perform SLAM-Seq at $t = 0$ and $t = 120$ $\\mathrm{min}$. Expect that upon UPF1 depletion, bona fide NMD targets decay faster because UPF1 loss leads to accumulation of decay intermediates that are rapidly cleared, while non-targets are unchanged.**\n\n- **Experimental Design**: This design is illogical. SLAM-Seq is used to label and track *newly synthesized* RNA. If one first adds actinomycin D to shut off transcription, there will be no new RNA to label via SLAM-Seq. One would use traditional RNA-Seq to measure the decay of the pre-existing pool. The proposed combination of actinomycin D and SLAM-Seq is nonsensical.\n- **Prediction**: The prediction that NMD targets decay *faster* upon UPF1 depletion is the opposite of the known biological effect. UPF1 is required for NMD; its loss *stabilizes* NMD targets, causing them to decay *slower*. The justification provided is speculative and contradicts the standard model of NMD.\n- **Verdict**: The experimental design is a misuse of the specified technology, and the predicted outcome is contrary to established biological principles. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2957387"}]}
