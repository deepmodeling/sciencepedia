This exercise provides practice in the crucial skill of deducing a protein's functional class—anti-apoptotic, effector, or BH3-only—from its domain architecture. Mastering this classification is a foundational task for understanding the logic of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and for interpreting new protein discoveries in this family [@problem_id:2935600].", "problem": "A research team identifies four human proteins (labeled P, Q, R, and S) with sequence features characteristic of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family. For each protein, homology-based motif annotation finds Bcl-2 Homology regions (BH1–BH4), and topology prediction identifies potential transmembrane (TM) segments. The proteins have the following properties:\n\n- Protein P: Contains BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4; has a single predicted C-terminal TM helix of approximately $20$ residues; the N-terminal region is predicted to be flexible.\n- Protein Q: Contains BH1, BH2, and BH3; lacks BH4; has a single predicted C-terminal TM helix of approximately $21$ residues.\n- Protein R: Contains only a BH3 motif; lacks BH1, BH2, and BH4; has no predicted TM segment; the polypeptide is largely intrinsically disordered.\n- Protein S: Contains only a BH3 motif; lacks BH1, BH2, and BH4; has a single predicted C-terminal TM helix of approximately $19$ residues.\n\nUsing only foundational, well-established structure–function relationships for the Bcl-2 family, classify each protein into one of three functional classes: anti-apoptotic, effector, or BH3-only. Then, select the option that both assigns the correct class to each protein and states the minimal, mechanistically grounded criteria that justify these assignments.\n\nA. P is anti-apoptotic; Q is effector; R is BH3-only; S is BH3-only. Justification: Anti-apoptotic members characteristically harbor BH1–BH4 with a single C-terminal TM and form ligand-binding grooves for BH3 helices; effectors (e.g., Bax/Bak) possess BH1–BH3 with a C-terminal TM required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; BH3-only proteins contain only the BH3 motif and can be either soluble (no TM) or tail-anchored (single C-terminal TM), but lack BH1–BH2 and do not form the canonical anti-apoptotic groove.\n\nB. P is effector; Q is anti-apoptotic; R is BH3-only; S is effector.

P is anti-apoptotic; Q is BH3-only; R is effector; S is BH3-only. Justification: Any protein lacking BH4 is BH3-only; any protein with a TM is an effector; anti-apoptotic proteins are those with the largest number of BH motifs.\n\nD. P is BH3-only; Q is effector; R is anti-apoptotic; S is BH3-only. Justification: The BH3 motif is sufficient to confer anti-apoptotic function when present alone; effectors require exactly one TM regardless of BH motif composition; anti-apoptotic proteins need not have a TM.", "solution": "We begin from foundational, widely accepted principles regarding Bcl-2 family organization and function:\n\n- The Bcl-2 family comprises three functional classes that regulate intrinsic apoptosis by controlling mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). These classes are defined by domain architecture and mechanism:\n  - Anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) contain BH1–BH4 and a single C-terminal membrane anchor. They fold into a conserved helical bundle that creates a hydrophobic ligand-binding groove formed by BH1–BH3 to sequester BH3 helices from pro-apoptotic partners. The BH4 region is a hallmark N-terminal regulatory module associated with anti-apoptotic activity.\n  - Effector proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak, Bok) contain BH1–BH3 and a single C-terminal membrane anchor. Upon activation, they undergo conformational changes, expose their BH3 region, oligomerize in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and form pores to drive MOMP. They lack BH4.\n  - BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bid, Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bik, Bmf) contain only the BH3 motif and lack BH1, BH2, and BH4. They function as sentinels or direct activators of effectors. Topology varies: some are soluble (no TM), while several are tail-anchored with a single C-terminal TM. By definition, they do not possess the BH1–BH3 hydrophobic groove of anti-apoptotic proteins and do not share the BH1–BH3 effector fold.\n\nFrom these principles, we derive classification criteria grounded in motif architecture and topology:\n- Presence of BH1–BH4 plus a single C-terminal TM implies anti-apoptotic class.\n- Presence of BH1–BH3 (absence of BH4) plus a single C-terminal TM implies effector class.\n- Presence of only BH3 (absence of BH1, BH2, BH4) implies BH3-only class, with or without a single C-terminal TM.\n\nNow classify each protein:\n\n- Protein P: BH1, BH2, BH3, BH4 present; single C-terminal TM. This matches the anti-apoptotic archetype. Therefore, P is anti-apoptotic.\n- Protein Q: BH1, BH2, BH3 present; BH4 absent; single C-terminal TM. This matches the effector archetype (e.g., Bax/Bak). Therefore, Q is an effector.\n- Protein R: Only BH3 present; no TM; largely disordered. This matches soluble BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bad, Puma). Therefore, R is BH3-only.\n- Protein S: Only BH3 present; single C-terminal TM. This matches tail-anchored BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bik, BimL). Therefore, S is BH3-only.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: Assigns P as anti-apoptotic; Q as effector; R as BH3-only; S as BH3-only. The justification correctly states that anti-apoptotic proteins possess BH1–BH4 plus a C-terminal TM and bind BH3 helices in a groove; that effectors possess BH1–BH3 plus a C-terminal TM to drive MOMP; and that BH3-only proteins contain only BH3 and may be soluble or tail-anchored. This matches the derived criteria. Verdict — Correct.\n- Option B: Assigns P as effector and Q as anti-apoptotic, using “any C-terminal TM implies effector” and “BH4 alone determines anti-apoptotic” as criteria. These are incorrect: many BH3-only members have a C-terminal TM yet are not effectors, and anti-apoptotic identity requires the BH1–BH3 groove plus BH4, not BH4 alone irrespective of the rest. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option C: Assigns Q as BH3-only despite clear BH1–BH3, and R as effector based solely on the presence of a TM (which R lacks). It further conflates “largest number of BH motifs” with anti-apoptotic identity, ignoring the qualitative requirement for BH1–BH3 groove and BH4. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option D: Assigns R as anti-apoptotic despite having only BH3, and P as BH3-only despite containing BH1–BH4. It also claims effectors require exactly one TM “regardless of BH motif composition,” which is false because BH1–BH3 content is essential to effector function. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with established structure–function relationships and the provided annotations is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2935600"}, {"introduction": "Building on the classification of proteins, we now turn to the quantitative nature of their interactions, which ultimately determines whether a cell lives or dies.

It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will now be derived.\n\n## DERIVATION OF SOLUTION\n\nThe solution to this problem requires interpreting the BH3 profiling data based on the known binding specificities of the various BH3-only peptides for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL, etc.).\n\n### First Principles: BH3 Peptide Specificity\nThe BH3 peptides used in the assay have distinct binding profiles for the major anti-apoptotic proteins that function to restrain apoptosis by sequestering pro-apoptotic proteins.\n- **BIM** and **PUMA**: These are considered \"activator\" or promiscuous peptides. They bind with high affinity to all major anti-apoptotic proteins, including MCL-1, BCL-2, and BCL-XL. A strong depolarization response to these peptides indicates the cell is \"primed for apoptosis\"—meaning its mitochondria are being actively restrained by one or more anti-apoptotic proteins and are close to the threshold of undergoing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).\n- **NOXA**: This is a \"sensitizer\" peptide that selectively binds to and antagonizes MCL-1 and its close homolog A1. It does not effectively inhibit BCL-2 or BCL-XL. A strong response to NOXA indicates a dependency on MCL-1 for survival.\n- **BAD**: This sensitizer peptide selectively binds to and antagonizes BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W. It does not effectively inhibit MCL-1. A strong response to BAD indicates a dependency on BCL-2 and/or BCL-XL.\n- **HRK**: This sensitizer peptide selectively binds to and antagonizes BCL-XL. It does not effectively inhibit BCL-2 or MCL-1. A strong response to HRK specifically indicates a dependency on BCL-XL.\n\n### Analysis of Experimental Data\n\n**1. Baseline Condition (Before Inhibitor):**\n- BIM: $60\\%$\n- PUMA: $50\\%$\n- NOXA: $60\\%$\n- BAD: $15\\%$\n- HRK: $5\\%$\n\nThe strong responses to BIM ($60\\%$) and PUMA ($50\\%$) show that the cancer cells are significantly primed for apoptosis. The crucial observation is the very high response to NOXA ($60\\%$), which is equivalent in magnitude to the response to the pan-specific BIM peptide. Since NOXA selectively antagonizes MCL-1, this result signifies that MCL-1 is the primary anti-apoptotic protein restraining apoptosis in these cells. Conversely, the low responses to BAD ($15\\%$) and HRK ($5\\%$) indicate that BCL-2 and BCL-XL play a minimal role in cell survival under baseline conditions.\n**Conclusion at Baseline:** The cells exhibit a strong dependence on MCL-1.\n\n**2. Post-Inhibitor Condition (After MEK Inhibitor):**\n- BIM: $80\\%$\n- PUMA: $75\\%$\n- NOXA: $10\\%$\n- BAD: $55\\%$\n- HRK: $50\\%$\n\nThe responses to BIM and PUMA have increased (from $60\\%$ to $80\\%$ and $50\\%$ to $75\\%$, respectively). This indicates that treatment with the MEK inhibitor has increased the overall mitochondrial priming, pushing the cells closer to the apoptotic threshold. This is a common consequence of targeted therapies that disrupt pro-survival signaling.\n\nThe most informative changes are in the sensitizer peptide responses:\n- The response to NOXA has collapsed from $60\\%$ to $10\\%$. This demonstrates a dramatic loss of MCL-1 dependence. This is consistent with the known biology where MEK/ERK signaling can stabilize MCL-1 protein; inhibiting MEK leads to MCL-1 degradation, thus removing it as a key survival factor.\n- The response to BAD has increased substantially from $15\\%$ to $55\\%$. Since BAD targets BCL-2 and BCL-XL, this indicates a newly acquired dependence on one or both of these proteins.\n- The response to HRK has increased dramatically from $5\\%$ to $50\\%$. Since HRK is selective for BCL-XL, this provides strong, specific evidence that the cells have become critically dependent on BCL-XL for survival. The large increase in the BAD response is consistent with this, as BAD also targets BCL-XL.\n\n**Conclusion after Inhibitor:** The cells have lost their dependence on MCL-1 and have acquired a strong, new dependence on BCL-XL.\n\n**3. Synthesis and Therapeutic Strategy:**\nThe MEK inhibitor induces a shift in anti-apoptotic dependence, moving from a reliance on MCL-1 to a reliance on BCL-XL. This phenomenon, known as \"dependency switching,\" is a common mechanism of acquired resistance but also presents a therapeutic opportunity. A rational combination therapy would pair the MEK inhibitor with a drug that targets the newly acquired vulnerability. In this case, the target should be BCL-XL.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Shift from myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) dependence to B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) dependence; combine MEK inhibitor with venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor).**\nThe initial part, a shift from MCL-1 dependence, is correct. The endpoint, however, is not the most precise description. While the BAD peptide response increase ($15\\% \\to 55\\%$) is consistent with BCL-2 dependence, the dramatic HRK peptide response increase ($5\\% \\to 50\\%$) specifically and strongly implicates BCL-XL. Targeting only BCL-2 with venetoclax would likely be suboptimal. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Shift from myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) dependence to B-cell lymphoma extra-large (BCL-XL) dependence; combine MEK inhibitor with A-1331852 (BCL-XL inhibitor).**\nThis statement accurately describes the observed shift. The loss of MCL-1 dependence is shown by the NOXA data. The gain of BCL-XL dependence is strongly supported by the dramatic increase in response to the BCL-XL-selective peptide HRK. The proposed combination therapy, using a MEK inhibitor with a BCL-XL inhibitor (A-1331852 is a known BCL-XL inhibitor), is a perfectly rational strategy to exploit this acquired vulnerability. **Correct**.\n\n**C. Increased myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) dependence after kinase inhibition; combine MEK inhibitor with S63845 (MCL-1 inhibitor).**\nThis is directly contradicted by the data. The response to the MCL-1-selective peptide NOXA plummeted from $60\\%$ to $10\\%$, indicating a loss, not an increase, of MCL-1 dependence. Combining with an MCL-1 inhibitor (like S63845) would be illogical. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No meaningful change in anti-apoptotic dependence; add a pan-caspase inhibitor to mitigate excessive apoptosis while continuing MEK inhibition.**\nThis statement is false on two counts. First, there was a clear, dramatic, and meaningful shift in anti-apoptotic dependence, as shown by the large changes in the NOXA, BAD, and HRK responses. Second, the therapeutic suggestion is nonsensical. The goal of cancer therapy is to induce apoptosis in malignant cells. Adding a pan-caspase inhibitor would block apoptosis and antagonize the intended effect of the cancer treatment. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2935493"}]}
