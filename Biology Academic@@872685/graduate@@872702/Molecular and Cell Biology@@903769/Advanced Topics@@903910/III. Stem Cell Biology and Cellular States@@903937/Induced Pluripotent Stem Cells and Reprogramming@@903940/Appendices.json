This requires several sequential steps: fitting the dose-response data for each compound to a simplified Hill equation, using these models to predict the single-agent effects at the specified combination doses, and finally applying the Bliss independence model.\n\nFirst, we model the dose-response for each compound. The problem specifies the Hill equation with a Hill coefficient $n=1$, which takes the form:\n$$\nE(d) = E_{0} + \\frac{(E_{\\max} - E_{0})d}{EC_{50} + d}\n$$\nwhere $E(d)$ is the effect (colony count) at dose $d$, $E_{0}$ is the baseline effect at zero dose, $E_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible effect, and $EC_{50}$ is the dose that elicits a half-maximal response.\n\nLet us analyze CHIR99021, which we denote as agent $C$. The provided data are $(d, E) = (0, 10), (0.5, 23), (1.0, 30), (3.0, 40), (10.0, 46)$.\nFollowing the problem's instructions:\n1.  The baseline effect is the count at $d=0$, so $E_{0,C} = 10$.\n2.  We must estimate $E_{\\max,C}$ as the asymptote suggested by the high-dose data. The highest observed effect is $46$ colonies at a dose of $10.0\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$. The response curve appears to be saturating. A reasonable estimate for the asymptote is $E_{\\max,C} = 50$.\n3.  The dose $EC_{50}$ is to be determined where the response is halfway between $E_{0}$ and $E_{\\max}$.

Let $p$ be the probability that a single, randomly selected cell is an undifferentiated iPSC. The selection of each cell for the transplant is modeled as an independent Bernoulli trial.\n\nThe event of a transplant containing \"at least one\" undifferentiated cell is the complement of the event that it contains \"zero\" undifferentiated cells.

This bound is based on the observation that zero positive results were found in a sample of $n$ cells, assayed with a test of sensitivity $\\eta$ and perfect specificity. The confidence level is $1-\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probability of a single cell testing negative as a function of $p$. Let $U$ be the event that a cell is an undifferentiated iPSC ($P(U) = p$), and $D$ be the event that it is a differentiated cell ($P(D) = 1-p$). The test characteristics are:\n- Sensitivity: $P(\\text{Test Positive} | U) = \\eta$. Thus, the probability of a false negative for an undifferentiated cell is $P(\\text{Test Negative} | U) = 1 - \\eta$.\n- Perfect Specificity: $P(\\text{Test Negative} | D) = 1$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall probability of a single cell testing negative is:\n$$P(\\text{Test Negative}) = P(\\text{Test Negative} | U) P(U) + P(\\text{Test Negative} | D) P(D)$$\n$$P(\\text{Test Negative}) = (1-\\eta)p + (1)(1-p) = 1 - \\eta p$$\n\nLet $E$ be the event that all $n$ independent assays return a negative result. The probability of this event, conditioned on the unknown parameter $p$, is:\n$$P(E|p) = [P(\\text{Test Negative})]^n = (1 - \\eta p)^n$$\n\nTo construct a $1-\\alpha$ upper confidence bound, we follow the frequentist principle. The upper bound $p_{\\max}$ is the value of $p$ for which the probability of observing our result (zero positives), or a result even more extreme, is equal to the significance level $\\alpha$.
