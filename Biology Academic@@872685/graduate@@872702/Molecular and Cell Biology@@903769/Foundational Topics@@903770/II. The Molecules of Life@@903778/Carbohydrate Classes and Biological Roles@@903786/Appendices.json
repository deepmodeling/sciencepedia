It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. We may proceed.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis: first, to identify the aldohexose represented by the provided SMILES string, and second, to determine the epimeric relationships between $D$-glucose, $D$-galactose, and $D$-mannose.\n\n**Part 1: Identification of the Monosaccharide from SMILES**\n\nThe given SMILES string is `O=CH[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)CO`.\nThe carbon backbone is numbered according to the provided convention, where the aldehyde carbon is $C_1$ and the terminal primary alcohol carbon is $C_6$. The stereocenters are $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$, and $C_5$.\n\nTo identify the specific aldohexose, we must determine the absolute configuration ($R$ or $S$) at each stereocenter ($C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$, $C_5$) by applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\nThe SMILES format `[C@...](...)` and `[C@@...](...)` specifies stereochemistry. For a standard Fischer projection of a linear sugar, a common convention interprets `[C@H](O)` as the hydroxyl group (`-OH`) being on the right side, and `[C@@H](O)` as it being on the left side. Applying this convention:\n- $C_2$: `[C@H](O)` $\\implies$ `-OH` on the right.\n- $C_3$: `[C@@H](O)` $\\implies$ `-OH` on the left.\n- $C_4$: `[C@H](O)` $\\implies$ `-OH` on the right.\n- $C_5$: `[C@H](O)` $\\implies$ `-OH` on the right.\n\nThis configuration corresponds to the Fischer projection of $D$-glucose:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{CHO} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{HO}-\\text{C}-\\text{H} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}\n\\end{array}\n\\quad\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\leftarrow C_1 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_2 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_3 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_4 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_5 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_6\n\\end{array}\n$$\nTo confirm this identification, we will determine the $R/S$ configuration for each stereocenter from this Fischer projection. In a Fischer projection, horizontal bonds point out of the page and vertical bonds point into the page. If the lowest-priority group (usually `-H`) is on a horizontal bond, the configuration is opposite to the direction of the $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ path.\n\n- **Configuration at $C_2$**:\n  - Priorities: $1$: `-OH`, $2$: `-CHO`, $3$: `-C_3...C_6` chain, $4$: `-H`.\n  - The path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is counter-clockwise.\n  - `-H` is on a horizontal bond, so we reverse the result. The configuration is $R$.\n\n- **Configuration at $C_3$**:\n  - Priorities: $1$: `-OH`, $2$: `-C_1...C_2` chain, $3$: `-C_4...C_6` chain, $4$: `-H`. (The chain above has higher priority due to the C=O group at $C_1$).\n  - The path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is clockwise.\n  - `-H` is on a horizontal bond, so we reverse the result. The configuration is $S$.\n\n- **Configuration at $C_4$**:\n  - Priorities: $1$: `-OH`, $2$: `-C_1...C_3` chain, $3$: `-C_5...C_6` chain, $4$: `-H`. (The chain above has higher priority).\n  - The path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is counter-clockwise.\n  - `-H` is on a horizontal bond, so we reverse the result. The configuration is $R$.\n\n- **Configuration at $C_5$**:\n  - Priorities: $1$: `-OH`, $2$: `-C_1...C_4` chain, $3$: `-CH_2OH` ($C_6$), $4$: `-H`.\n  - The path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is counter-clockwise.\n  - `-H` is on a horizontal bond, so we reverse the result. The configuration is $R$.\n\nThe sequence of configurations is $(C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5) = (R, S, R, R)$. This is the correct stereochemical signature for $D$-glucose. The configuration at $C_5$ is $R$, which, according to the problem's definition, designates it as a $D$-sugar. Thus, the SMILES string encodes $D$-glucose.\n\n**Part 2: Epimeric Relationships**\n\nWe now establish the stereochemistry for the three relevant $D$-aldohexoses. All are $D$-sugars, meaning the configuration at $C_5$ (the highest-numbered stereocenter) is $R$.\n\n- **$D$-Glucose**: As derived above, the configuration is $(C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5) = (R, S, R, R)$.\n- **$D$-Mannose**: By definition, $D$-mannose is the $C_2$ epimer of $D$-glucose. This means it differs from $D$-glucose only in the configuration at $C_2$. Therefore, the configuration of $D$-mannose is $(S, S, R, R)$.\n- **$D$-Galactose**: By definition, $D$-galactose is the $C_4$ epimer of $D$-glucose. This means it differs from $D$-glucose only in the configuration at $C_4$. Therefore, the configuration of $D$-galactose is $(R, S, S, R)$.\n\nNow we analyze the relationships based on these configurations:\n1.  **$D$-Glucose vs. $D$-Mannose**: $(R, S, R, R)$ vs. $(S, S, R, R)$. They differ only at $C_2$. They are $C_2$ epimers.\n2.  **$D$-Glucose vs. $D$-Galactose**: $(R, S, R, R)$ vs. $(R, S, S, R)$. They differ only at $C_4$. They are $C_4$ epimers.\n3.  **$D$-Mannose vs. $D$-Galactose**: $(S, S, R, R)$ vs. $(R, S, S, R)$. They differ at $C_2$ ($S$ vs. $R$) and at $C_4$ ($R$ vs. $S$). Since they differ at more than one stereocenter, they are diastereomers but are not epimers.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Options**\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on our findings.\n\n**A.

It is $D$-glucose.\nAlthough the latter three statements about epimeric relationships are correct, the first premise is false, making the entire option incorrect.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, every component of option A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2937684"}, {"introduction": "Moving from single units to the complex glycans found on cell surfaces requires the coordinated action of highly specific enzymes.

We rearrange it into a standard quadratic form, $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$, where $x = [PL]$.\n$$ K_D [PL] = ([P]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [PL])([L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [PL]) $$\n$$ K_D [PL] = [P]_{\\mathrm{tot}}[L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [P]_{\\mathrm{tot}}[PL] - [L]_{\\mathrm{tot}}[PL] + [PL]^2 $$\n$$ 0 = [PL]^2 - ([P]_{\\mathrm{tot}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_D)[PL] + [P]_{\\mathrm{tot}}[L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $[P]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[L]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_D = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the quadratic equation (we may omit the units for calculation as they are consistent throughout):\n$$ [PL]^2 - (1 + 10 + 1)[PL] + (1)(10) = 0 $$\n$$ [PL]^2 - 12[PL] + 10 = 0 $$\n\nWe solve this equation for $[PL]$ using the quadratic formula, $[PL] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-12$, and $c=10$.\n$$ [PL] = \\frac{-(-12) \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(1)(10)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ [PL] = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 40}}{2} $$\n$$ [PL] = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{104}}{2} $$\n\nThis yields two possible mathematical solutions for $[PL]$:\n$$ [PL]_1 = \\frac{12 + \\sqrt{104}}{2} \\approx \\frac{12 + 10.198}{2} \\approx 11.099\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n$$ [PL]_2 = \\frac{12 - \\sqrt{104}}{2} \\approx \\frac{12 - 10.198}{2} \\approx 0.9010\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n\nWe must select the physically valid solution. The concentration of the complex, $[PL]$, cannot exceed the total concentration of either reactant. Specifically, $[PL] \\le [P]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $[PL] \\le [L]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.
