A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: a derivation followed by two numerical calculations.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Proton Motive Force ($\\Delta p$)**\n\nWe start from the definition of the electrochemical potential difference for a proton ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, designated as $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$. The charge number for a proton is $z=1$.\n\nThe electrochemical potential in the matrix (inside) is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + (1)F\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nThe electrochemical potential in the intermembrane space (outside) is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + (1)F\\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is assumed to be the same in both compartments as the solvent is aqueous in both.\n\nThe difference, as defined in the problem, is $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = (\\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + F\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}}) - (\\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + F\\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = RT (\\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}}) + F (\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{in}}}{a_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right) + F\\Delta\\psi $$\nHere, $a_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{out}}$ are the activities of the hydrogen ion in the respective compartments, and $\\Delta\\psi$ is the given potential difference.\n\nThe relationship between pH and hydrogen ion activity, $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, is definitional: $\\mathrm{pH} \\equiv -\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})$. This can be rearranged to express the natural logarithm of activity in terms of pH. Since $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$, we have:\n$$ \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) = -\\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} $$\nApplying this to the logarithmic term in our expression for $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{in}}}{a_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right) = \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{in}}) - \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{out}}) = (-\\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}}) - (-\\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{in}}}{a_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right) = -\\ln(10) (\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}}) = -\\ln(10) \\Delta\\mathrm{pH} $$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = -RT \\ln(10) \\Delta\\mathrm{pH} + F\\Delta\\psi $$\nThe problem defines the proton motive force, $\\Delta p$, via the relation $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = F\\,\\Delta p$. Therefore, we can find an expression for $\\Delta p$ by dividing by the Faraday constant, $F$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{F} = \\frac{-RT \\ln(10) \\Delta\\mathrm{pH} + F\\Delta\\psi}{F} $$\n$$ \\Delta p = \\Delta\\psi - \\frac{RT \\ln(10)}{F} \\Delta\\mathrm{pH} $$\nThis is the required expression. No approximation was made in this derivation, as the relationship between pH and activity is a formal definition. The implicit assumption is that the activity coefficients are accounted for within the definition of pH.\n\n2.  **Numerical Calculation of $\\Delta p$**\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the derived expression.\n- $\\Delta\\psi = -0.150\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $\\Delta\\mathrm{pH} = 0.5$\n- $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $F = 96485.33212\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the coefficient term $\\frac{RT \\ln(10)}{F}$. The units are $\\frac{(\\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(\\mathrm{K})}{\\mathrm{C}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{C}} = \\mathrm{V}$, which is correct.\n$$ \\frac{RT \\ln(10)}{F} = \\frac{(8.314462618)(310) \\ln(10)}{96485.33212} \\approx 0.061576\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nNow, we calculate $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = -0.150\\ \\mathrm{V} - (0.061576\\ \\mathrm{V})(0.5) $$\n$$ \\Delta p = -0.150\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.030788\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\n$$ \\Delta p = -0.180788\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$ \\Delta p \\approx -0.1808\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of the net force.\n\n3.  **Numerical Calculation of Molar Free Energy Change ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$)**\n\nThe problem defines the molar free energy change for proton influx as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\equiv \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{out}}$, which is precisely $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$.

Use only the following foundational facts as your starting base, which are broadly established by chemiosmotic theory and structural biochemistry:\n\n1. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in its reduced form (NADH) donates electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) at Complex I, leading to the translocation of a total of $10$ protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane per matrix NADH oxidized (Complex I, III, and IV together). Flavin adenine dinucleotide in its reduced form (FADH$_2$) donates electrons downstream of Complex I (e.g., Complex II to ubiquinone), leading to the translocation of $6$ protons per matrix FADH$_2$ oxidized (Complex III and IV).\n2. The F$_\\mathrm{O}$ sector of the F$_1$F$_\\mathrm{O}$-adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATP synthase) contains a $c$-ring with $n_c$ identical $c$-subunits; one full $360^\\circ$ rotation of the $c$-ring requires $n_c$ protons. The F$_1$ sector has three catalytic sites and synthesizes $3$ molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per full $360^\\circ$ rotation.\n3. Transport associated with making usable ATP imposes an additional effective cost of $1$ proton equivalent per ATP exported and phosphate imported across the inner membrane (aggregate of the phosphate–proton symporter and the electrogenic adenine nucleotide antiporter), assumed constant over the physiological range considered.\n4. During complete oxidation of one glucose: glycolysis yields a net of $2$ ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation) and $2$ cytosolic NADH; the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex yields $2$ matrix NADH; the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle yields $6$ matrix NADH, $2$ matrix FADH$_2$, and $2$ guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which you should count as $2$ ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation.\n5. The $2$ cytosolic NADH produced by glycolysis are reoxidized by a mixture of the malate–aspartate shuttle (MAS) and the glycerol–$3$-phosphate (G3P) shuttle. Let a fraction $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ of the cytosolic NADH be carried by MAS, delivering reducing equivalents to Complex I (thus behaving like matrix NADH), and the remaining fraction $1-\\alpha$ be carried by the G3P shuttle, delivering reducing equivalents to ubiquinone (thus behaving like matrix FADH$_2$ with respect to proton translocation).\n\nStarting from these facts and no others, derive an exact closed-form expression $Y(n_c,\\alpha)$ for the total number of ATP molecules synthesized per glucose (counting both substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation), in terms of the $c$-ring subunit number $n_c$ and the shuttle partition parameter $\\alpha$. Express your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression in terms of $n_c$ and $\\alpha$. Do not insert any numerical values for $n_c$ or $\\alpha$, do not round, and do not include units.\n\nYour derivation must make clear how the commonly cited values of $2.5$ ATP per NADH and $1.5$ ATP per FADH$_2$ arise from proton budgets under an appropriate choice of $n_c$ consistent with the above assumptions, but the final answer you report must be only the requested closed-form $Y(n_c,\\alpha)$.", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides a set of axioms from which a unique analytical solution can be derived. No flaws as per the specified criteria are present. The problem is therefore valid, and we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the total yield of adenosine triphosphate, $Y(n_c, \\alpha)$, from the complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose. This total yield is the sum of ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation ($\\text{ATP}_{\\text{SLP}}$) and by oxidative phosphorylation ($\\text{ATP}_{\\text{OxPhos}}$).\n$$Y(n_c, \\alpha) = \\text{ATP}_{\\text{SLP}} + \\text{ATP}_{\\text{OxPhos}}$$\n\nFirst, we account for ATP produced via substrate-level phosphorylation, which occurs independently of the proton motive force.\nAccording to the givens:\n1.  Glycolysis yields a net of $2$ molecules of ATP.\n2.  The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle yields $2$ molecules of GTP, which are energetically equivalent to ATP.\nThus, the total yield from substrate-level phosphorylation is:\n$$\\text{ATP}_{\\text{SLP}} = 2 + 2 = 4$$\n\nNext, we calculate the yield from oxidative phosphorylation. This requires determining the total number of protons translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane and the number of protons required to synthesize and transport one molecule of ATP.\n\nThe proton cost of one usable ATP molecule must be established. The F$_1$F$_\\mathrm{O}$-ATP synthase requires $n_c$ protons to drive a full $360^\\circ$ rotation that produces $3$ ATP molecules. Therefore, the proton cost of synthesis is $\\frac{n_c}{3}$ protons per ATP. Additionally, there is a transport cost of $1$ proton equivalent per ATP molecule exported from the matrix. The total proton cost, $P_{\\text{cost}}$, for producing one usable ATP molecule in the cytosol is the sum of these two costs:\n$$P_{\\text{cost}} = \\frac{n_c}{3} + 1 = \\frac{n_c + 3}{3}$$\n\nNow, we must quantify the total number of protons pumped by the electron transport chain (ETC). This is a function of the number of reduced coenzymes, NADH and FADH$_2$, that are oxidized. We must account for all sources.\n1.  Matrix NADH: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex yields $2$ NADH, and the TCA cycle yields $6$ NADH.\n2.  Matrix FADH$_2$: The TCA cycle yields $2$ FADH$_2$.\n3.  Cytosolic NADH: Glycolysis produces $2$ cytosolic NADH. These reducing equivalents are transferred to the matrix by two different shuttle systems. A fraction $\\alpha$ is handled by the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regenerates NADH inside the matrix. The remaining fraction, $1-\\alpha$, is handled by the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) shuttle, which generates FADH$_2$.\n\nThe total number of matrix NADH equivalents, $N_{\\text{NADH}}$, oxidized by the ETC is:\n$$N_{\\text{NADH}} = \\underbrace{2}_{\\text{PDH}} + \\underbrace{6}_{\\text{TCA}} + \\underbrace{2\\alpha}_{\\text{MAS}} = 8 + 2\\alpha$$\nThe total number of matrix FADH$_2$ equivalents, $N_{\\text{FADH}_2}$, oxidized by the ETC is:\n$$N_{\\text{FADH}_2} = \\underbrace{2}_{\\text{TCA}} + \\underbrace{2(1-\\alpha)}_{\\text{G3P}} = 2 + 2 - 2\\alpha = 4 - 2\\alpha$$\n\nAccording to the givens, each matrix NADH oxidized leads to the translocation of $10$ protons, and each matrix FADH$_2$ leads to $6$ protons. The total number of protons pumped, $H^{+}_{\\text{total}}$, is:\n$$H^{+}_{\\text{total}} = 10 \\cdot N_{\\text{NADH}} + 6 \\cdot N_{\\text{FADH}_2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{\\text{NADH}}$ and $N_{\\text{FADH}_2}$:\n$$H^{+}_{\\text{total}} = 10(8 + 2\\alpha) + 6(4 - 2\\alpha)$$\n$$H^{+}_{\\text{total}} = 80 + 20\\alpha + 24 - 12\\alpha$$\n$$H^{+}_{\\text{total}} = 104 + 8\\alpha$$\n\nThe total yield from oxidative phosphorylation is the total number of protons pumped divided by the proton cost per ATP:\n$$\\text{ATP}_{\\text{OxPhos}} = \\frac{H^{+}_{\\text{total}}}{P_{\\text{cost}}} = \\frac{104 + 8\\alpha}{\\frac{n_c + 3}{3}} = \\frac{3(104 + 8\\alpha)}{n_c + 3} = \\frac{312 + 24\\alpha}{n_c + 3}$$\n\nIt is instructive to use this framework to derive the commonly cited P/O ratios. The ATP yield per NADH is the number of protons it pumps ($10$) divided by $P_{\\text{cost}}$: $\\frac{10}{(n_c+3)/3} = \\frac{30}{n_c+3}$. For this to equal $2.5$, we require $\\frac{30}{n_c+3} = 2.5$, which solves to $n_c=9$. The ATP yield per FADH$_2$ is $\\frac{6}{(n_c+3)/3} = \\frac{18}{n_c+3}$. For this to equal $1.5$, we require $\\frac{18}{n_c+3} = 1.5$, which also gives $n_c=9$. Thus, the values of $2.5$ and $1.5$ are a direct consequence of assuming $n_c=9$ within this theoretical model. The problem, correctly, leaves $n_c$ as a variable.\n\nFinally, we combine the ATP yields from substrate-level and oxidative phosphorylation to obtain the total yield $Y(n_c, \\alpha)$:\n$$Y(n_c, \\alpha) = \\text{ATP}_{\\text{SLP}} + \\text{ATP}_{\\text{OxPhos}} = 4 + \\frac{312 + 24\\alpha}{n_c + 3}$$\nTo express this as a single simplified fraction, we find a common denominator:\n$$Y(n_c, \\alpha) = \\frac{4(n_c + 3)}{n_c + 3} + \\frac{312 + 24\\alpha}{n_c + 3}$$\n$$Y(n_c, \\alpha) = \\frac{4n_c + 12 + 312 + 24\\alpha}{n_c + 3}$$\n$$Y(n_c, \\alpha) = \\frac{4n_c + 324 + 24\\alpha}{n_c + 3}$$\nFactoring the constant $4$ from the numerator gives the final simplified form:\n$$Y(n_c, \\alpha) = \\frac{4(n_c + 81 + 6\\alpha)}{n_c + 3}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the total ATP yield per glucose molecule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4(n_c + 81 + 6\\alpha)}{n_c + 3}}$$", "id": "2954682"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are powerful, but their true test lies in experimental validation.

It is the difference between the maximal respiration rate (induced by FCCP) and the basal respiration rate. Both rates must be corrected for non-mitochondrial OCR.\n    Maximal mitochondrial respiration is $\\overline{\\text{OCR}}_{\\text{FCCP}} - \\text{OCR}_{\\text{non-mito}}$.\n    Basal mitochondrial respiration is $\\overline{\\text{OCR}}_{\\text{basal}} - \\text{OCR}_{\\text{non-mito}}$.\n    Therefore,\n    $$ \\text{Spare Respiratory Capacity} = (\\overline{\\text{OCR}}_{\\text{FCCP}} - \\text{OCR}_{\\text{non-mito}}) - (\\overline{\\text{OCR}}_{\\text{basal}} - \\text{OCR}_{\\text{non-mito}}) $$\n    $$ \\text{Spare Respiratory Capacity} = \\overline{\\text{OCR}}_{\\text{FCCP}} - \\overline{\\text{OCR}}_{\\text{basal}} $$\n    $$ \\text{Spare Respiratory Capacity} = 180 - 115 = 65 $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $65.00$.\n\nThe final calculated values, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- ATP-linked respiration: $57.33$ $\\mathrm{pmol\\ O_{2}\\ min^{-1}}$ per $10^{6}$ cells.\n- Proton leak: $37.67$ $\\mathrm{pmol\\ O_{2}\\ min^{-1}}$ per $10^{6}$ cells.\n- Spare respiratory capacity: $65.00$ $\\mathrm{pmol\\ O_{2}\\ min^{-1}}$ per $10^{6}$ cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 57.33 & 37.67 & 65.00 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2954702"}]}
