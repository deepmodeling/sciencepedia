A standard geometric constraint is that the aggregate cross-sectional area available per molecule must be sufficient to accommodate the hydrocarbon chain volume over the maximum effective chain length, leading to the definition of the critical packing parameter $p$ as the dimensionless ratio\n$$\np \\equiv \\frac{v}{a_0\\,l_c},\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the hydrocarbon volume per molecule, $a_0$ is the effective headgroup area at the aggregate interface, and $l_c$ is the maximum effective hydrocarbon chain length.

The small headgroup area relative to the large hydrocarbon volume creates a distinct conical molecular shape, which packs most efficiently into aggregates with negative interfacial curvature, such as inverted micelles or an inverted hexagonal ($H_{II}$) phase.\n\n**2. Calculation for Lipid B**\n\nGiven the parameters for Lipid B:\n- $v_B = 1130\\ \\text{\\AA}^3$\n- $a_{0,B} = 80\\ \\text{\\AA}^2$\n- $l_{c,B} = 18.0\\ \\text{\\AA}$\n\nThe packing parameter $p_B$ is calculated as:\n$$\np_B = \\frac{v_B}{a_{0,B} l_{c,B}} = \\frac{1130\\ \\text{\\AA}^3}{(80\\ \\text{\\AA}^2)(18.0\\ \\text{\\AA})} = \\frac{1130}{1440} \\approx 0.7847\n$$\nSince $\\frac{1}{2} < p_B \\approx 0.7847 < 1$, Lipid B is predicted to form lamellar bilayers. Its larger headgroup area better balances the hydrocarbon volume, resulting in a truncated cone or nearly cylindrical molecular shape that favors packing into planar structures with zero net curvature.\n\n**3. Calculation for the Mixture**\n\nThe mixture contains a mole fraction $x_A = 0.55$ of Lipid A and, consequently, a mole fraction $x_B = 1 - x_A = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45$ of Lipid B. Based on the assumption of ideal mixing, the average parameters for the mixture are calculated as mole-fraction-weighted averages.\n\nThe effective headgroup area of the mixture, $a_{0,\\mathrm{mix}}$, is:\n$$\na_{0,\\mathrm{mix}} = x_A a_{0,A} + (1-x_A) a_{0,B} = (0.55)(40\\ \\text{\\AA}^2) + (0.45)(80\\ \\text{\\AA}^2) = 22\\ \\text{\\AA}^2 + 36\\ \\text{\\AA}^2 = 58\\ \\text{\\AA}^2\n$$\n\nThe hydrocarbon volume of the mixture, $v_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{mix}} = x_A v_A + (1-x_A) v_B = (0.55)(1090\\ \\text{\\AA}^3) + (0.45)(1130\\ \\text{\\AA}^3) = 599.5\\ \\text{\\AA}^3 + 508.5\\ \\text{\\AA}^3 = 1108\\ \\text{\\AA}^3\n$$\n\nThe effective chain length is constant across the components: $l_{c,\\mathrm{mix}} = l_{c,A} = l_{c,B} = 18.0\\ \\text{\\AA}$.\n\nThe packing parameter of the mixture, $p_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is therefore:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{a_{0,\\mathrm{mix}} l_{c,\\mathrm{mix}}} = \\frac{1108\\ \\text{\\AA}^3}{(58\\ \\text{\\AA}^2)(18.0\\ \\text{\\AA})} = \\frac{1108}{1044} \\approx 1.0613\n$$\nSince $p_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 1.0613 > 1$, the mixture is also predicted to form inverted phases. The presence of a significant mole fraction of the cone-shaped Lipid A increases the average packing parameter of the mixture above unity, destabilizing the lamellar phase favored by pure Lipid B and inducing a transition to a structure with negative curvature. This shows how changes in lipid composition can modulate the phase behavior of a membrane.\n\nIn summary, the computed values for the packing parameters are:\n- $p_A \\approx 1.514$\n- $p_B \\approx 0.7847$\n- $p_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 1.061$\n\nThe final result is requested as a row vector of these three values, rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.514 & 0.7847 & 1.061\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2952489"}, {"introduction": "The fluidity of a membrane is directly tied to the packing efficiency of its constituent lipid tails, with unsaturation playing a key role.
