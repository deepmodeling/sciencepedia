{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before the age of rapid genome sequencing, geneticists ingeniously mapped bacterial genes by observing the timing of their transfer during conjugation. The classic interrupted mating experiments of Jacob and Wollman established that genes are arranged linearly and that the time it takes to transfer a gene is proportional to its physical distance from an origin of transfer, or $oriT$. This exercise challenges you to replicate their logic, using time-of-entry data from a hypothetical Hfr cross to determine gene order, map distances, and pinpoint the location of $oriT$ on the circular chromosome [@problem_id:2945694].", "problem": "An Escherichia coli High Frequency Recombination (Hfr) donor is mated with a Fertility factor-negative (F-) recipient and sampled by interrupted mating. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) conjugative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transfer from an Hfr donor initiates at a single origin of transfer (oriT) and proceeds linearly into the donor chromosome, (ii) along the standard circular chromosome map of length $100$ minutes, map distance in minutes is proportional to DNA length, (iii) under the conditions used here, the effective transfer velocity is $1.00$ map minute per real minute, and (iv) the initiation lag and phenotypic scoring delays have been independently corrected to $0$ minutes so that the observed first-appearance times reflect true entry times. The markers are selectable and non-epistatic for scoring.\n\nIndependent genomic mapping provides the absolute minute positions (on the $0$ to $100$ minute circular reference map) for the following nine markers: \n- $xyl$ at $4$ minutes,\n- $purE$ at $14$ minutes,\n- $leu$ at $25$ minutes,\n- $ton$ at $39$ minutes,\n- $thi$ at $48$ minutes,\n- $lac$ at $60$ minutes,\n- $gal$ at $67$ minutes,\n- $arg$ at $82$ minutes,\n- $met$ at $93$ minutes.\n\nIn an interrupted mating time-of-entry experiment using this Hfr donor, the earliest reproducible detection times (in minutes after mating onset) for these markers are:\n- $lac$ at $1$ minute,\n- $gal$ at $8$ minutes,\n- $arg$ at $23$ minutes,\n- $met$ at $34$ minutes,\n- $xyl$ at $45$ minutes,\n- $purE$ at $55$ minutes,\n- $leu$ at $66$ minutes,\n- $ton$ at $80$ minutes,\n- $thi$ at $89$ minutes.\n\nUsing only the foundational facts above and the provided data, determine the entry order of the nine markers and the relative map distances (in minutes) between adjacent markers in that order. Infer the transfer direction (clockwise or counterclockwise on the $0$ to $100$ minute reference map) by comparing the observed entry order to the known absolute positions. Finally, compute the absolute coordinate of the origin of transfer (oriT) on the $0$ to $100$ minute map.

All premises, such as linear transfer and constant velocity, are standard idealizations for this type of analysis. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a complete and consistent set of data. The number of givens is sufficient to deduce a unique location for the origin of transfer, $oriT$. No essential information is missing, and there are no contradictions in the data.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unambiguous language. It is free from subjective claims or opinions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action.**\nThe problem is deemed valid and well-posed. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe solution is derived through a systematic analysis of the provided experimental data.\n\n**1. Determination of Marker Entry Order and Relative Distances.**\nThe order of gene transfer is directly determined by sorting the markers according to their experimental time of entry. This yields the linear sequence:\n$lac$ ($1$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $gal$ ($8$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $arg$ ($23$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $met$ ($34$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $xyl$ ($45$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $purE$ ($55$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $leu$ ($66$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $ton$ ($80$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $thi$ ($89$ min).\n\nGiven that the transfer velocity is $1.00$ map minute per real minute, the time elapsed between the entry of any two successive markers is numerically equal to the map distance separating them along the chromosome segment being transferred. The relative distances between adjacent markers are calculated as follows:\n- $d(lac, gal) = 8 - 1 = 7$ minutes\n- $d(gal, arg) = 23 - 8 = 15$ minutes\n- $d(arg, met) = 34 - 23 = 11$ minutes\n- $d(met, xyl) = 45 - 34 = 11$ minutes\n- $d(xyl, purE) = 55 - 45 = 10$ minutes\n- $d(purE, leu) = 66 - 55 = 11$ minutes\n- $d(leu, ton) = 80 - 66 = 14$ minutes\n- $d(ton, thi) = 89 - 80 = 9$ minutes\n\n**2. Inference of Transfer Direction.**\nThe direction of DNA transfer is inferred by comparing the experimentally determined gene order with the known absolute positions of these genes on the $0-100$ minute circular reference map.\n- Experimental Order: $lac \\rightarrow gal \\rightarrow arg \\rightarrow met \\rightarrow xyl \\rightarrow purE \\rightarrow leu \\rightarrow ton \\rightarrow thi$\n- Absolute Positions: $60 \\rightarrow 67 \\rightarrow 82 \\rightarrow 93 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 14 \\rightarrow 25 \\rightarrow 39 \\rightarrow 48$\n\nThe progression of map coordinates from $P_{lac}=60$ to $P_{met}=93$ is strictly increasing. The subsequent transfer from $met$ (position $93$) to $xyl$ (position $4$) indicates that the transfer process has crossed the $100/0$ minute boundary of the map. From $xyl$ onwards, the coordinates again increase sequentially. This monotonic increase in map coordinates (modulo $100$) establishes the direction of transfer as **clockwise**.\n\nTo confirm this conclusion, the map distances calculated from the absolute positions must match the time differences from the experiment. For a clockwise transfer:\n- $P_{gal} - P_{lac} = 67 - 60 = 7$. This matches the observed time interval.\n- $P_{arg} - P_{gal} = 82 - 67 = 15$. This matches.\n- $P_{met} - P_{arg} = 93 - 82 = 11$. This matches.\n- $d(met, xyl) = (100 - P_{met}) + P_{xyl} = (100 - 93) + 4 = 11$. This matches.\n- $P_{purE} - P_{xyl} = 14 - 4 = 10$. This matches.\n- The remaining distances consistently align. The data shows perfect internal consistency.\n\n**3. Computation of the $oriT$ Coordinate.**\nThe origin of transfer, $oriT$, is the starting point of DNA transfer. According to the problem statement, the entry time of the first marker is equal to the map distance from $oriT$ to that marker.\n- First marker to enter: $lac$.\n- Absolute position of $lac$: $P_{lac} = 60$ minutes.\n- Time of entry of $lac$: $t_{lac} = 1$ minute.\n- Thus, the distance from $oriT$ to $lac$ is $d(oriT, lac) = 1$ map minute.\n\nSince the transfer is clockwise, $oriT$ must be located upstream of the $lac$ gene, which corresponds to a numerically smaller coordinate on the map. The position of $oriT$ is therefore calculated by subtracting the distance from the position of $lac$.\n$$P_{oriT} = P_{lac} - d(oriT, lac)$$\n$$P_{oriT} = 60 - 1 = 59 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nWe verify this position with another marker, for instance $arg$. The time of entry for $arg$ is $23$ minutes. The clockwise distance from $P_{oriT}=59$ to $P_{arg}=82$ is $82 - 59 = 23$ minutes, which matches the observation. The position is confirmed.\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $59$ is written as $59.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{59.0}$$", "id": "2945694"}, {"introduction": "The cracking of the genetic code by Nirenberg and Khorana is a triumph of biochemical reasoning, where synthetic ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymers were used to program protein synthesis in a cell-free system.

While often taught qualitatively, the system's logic can be described with mathematical precision using biophysical models where transcription rate, $r_j$, is a function of repressor concentration and binding affinity. This exercise advances your understanding by requiring you to apply such a quantitative framework to predict gene expression levels in various merodiploid strains, thereby solidifying the mechanistic basis of gene control [@problem_id:2945675].", "problem": "Jacob–Monod merodiploid logic provides a mechanistic basis to connect genotype to expression in the lactose operon of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Consider partial diploids formed by an episome known as the fertility factor prime (F') carrying lactose operon alleles. The lactose repressor gene $I$ acts in trans, the operator $O$ and promoter $P$ act in cis, and the lactose structural gene $Z$ encodes $\\beta$-galactosidase. Assume a simple occupancy model for transcription regulation, grounded in the law of mass action and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: transcription of each operon occurs at a maximal rate $r_{\\max}$ when its operator is not bound by active repressor, and is fully blocked when bound. For an operator with wild-type sequence $O^{+}$, the probability that the operator is occupied by active repressor is $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}=\\dfrac{R_{a}}{R_{a}+K}$, where $R_{a}$ is the cell-wide concentration of active repressor and $K0$ is an effective dissociation parameter. For a constitutive operator $O^{c}$, $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}=0$. The promoter allele $P^{-}$ has zero activity and $P^{+}$ has unit activity. Thus, for operon $j$, the transcription rate is\n$$\nr_{j}=r_{\\max}\\,s_{P_{j}}\\left(1-p_{\\mathrm{bound},j}\\right),\n$$\nwith $s_{P^{+}}=1$ and $s_{P^{-}}=0$. Assume that $\\beta$-galactosidase synthesis is proportional to transcription and that translation and enzyme stability do not differ between operons, so that $r_{j}$ is proportional to the enzyme synthesis rate.\n\nActive repressor concentration $R_{a}$ depends on $I$-gene alleles present anywhere in the cell. Let each $I^{+}$ or $I^{s}$ allele contribute a concentration $c0$ of repressor subunits that are active in the absence of inducer. An $I^{-}$ allele contributes $0$. Under saturating inducer: $I^{+}$-derived repressor is fully inactivated, while $I^{s}$ (superrepressor) remains fully active. Hence, in the absence of inducer, $R_{a}=c\\,(n_{+}+n_{s})$, and in the presence of saturating inducer, $R_{a}=c\\,n_{s}$, where $n_{+}$ and $n_{s}$ are the copy numbers of $I^{+}$ and $I^{s}$ alleles, respectively, in the merodiploid.\n\nAnalyze the following three Escherichia coli F' merodiploids, each carrying two lactose operons (one chromosomal and one episomal):\n\n- Strain $\\mathrm{A}$: Chromosome $I^{+}O^{+}P^{+}Z^{+}$; F' $I^{-}O^{c}P^{+}Z^{+}$.\n- Strain $\\mathrm{B}$: Chromosome $I^{-}O^{+}P^{+}Z^{+}$; F' $I^{s}O^{+}P^{+}Z^{+}$.\n- Strain $\\mathrm{C}$: Chromosome $I^{+}O^{+}P^{-}Z^{+}$; F' $I^{+}O^{+}P^{+}Z^{+}$.\n\nUsing only the rules and model stated above, determine for each strain whether the $\\beta$-galactosidase locus is expressed with and without saturating inducer, and compute the corresponding expected synthesis rates by evaluating $r_{j}$ for each operon and summing across the two operons in the same cell.\n\nFinally, define the dimensionless fold-change\n$$\nQ \\equiv \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(\\mathrm{A})+R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(\\mathrm{B})+R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(\\mathrm{C})}{R_{\\mathrm{unind}}(\\mathrm{A})+R_{\\mathrm{unind}}(\\mathrm{B})+R_{\\mathrm{unind}}(\\mathrm{C})},\n$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(\\cdot)$ and $R_{\\mathrm{unind}}(\\cdot)$ denote the total $\\beta$-galactosidase synthesis rate in the indicated strain in the presence and absence of saturating inducer, respectively.
