The language is objective and precise, and the model, though simplified, is a standard and appropriate representation for such a system. The problem contains no scientific fallacies, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to establish a mathematical model for the surface density of $\\text{PI(3)P}$, $P(t)$, based on the provided principles. The rate of change of $P(t)$ is given by the balance between its production and removal.\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Production}) - (\\text{Rate of Removal})\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the rate of production is catalyzed by VPS34 and is proportional to its effective catalytic activity, $A_{V}$. The proportionality constant is $k_{p}$. Thus,\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Production} = k_{p} A_{V}\n$$\nThis rate is independent of the product concentration $P(t)$, characteristic of a zero-order process with respect to the product, which is consistent with the assumption that the substrate (phosphatidylinositol) is not limiting.\n\nThe rate of removal is catalyzed by MTM1 and is proportional to both its effective activity, $A_{M}$, and the instantaneous $\\text{PI(3)P}$ density, $P(t)$. The proportionality constant is $k_{d}$. This describes a first-order process with respect to $P(t)$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Removal} = k_{d} A_{M} P(t)\n$$\nCombining these terms, we construct the governing ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k_{p} A_{V} - k_{d} A_{M} P(t)\n$$\nTo find the steady-state density, denoted $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, we impose the condition that the density no longer changes with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the time derivative to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} \\Big|_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to our governing equation yields:\n$$\n0 = k_{p} A_{V} - k_{d} A_{M} P_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\nWe can now solve for $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ as a function of the activities $A_{V}$ and $A_{M}$ and the rate constants $k_{p}$ and $k_{d}$.\n$$\nk_{d} A_{M} P_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{p} A_{V}\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{p} A_{V}}{k_{d} A_{M}}\n$$\nThis expression relates the steady-state $\\text{PI(3)P}$ density to the activities of the synthesizing and degrading enzymes.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the two conditions specified: the baseline state and the new perturbed state.\nThe baseline steady-state density, $P_{\\mathrm{ss,base}}$, corresponds to the case where $A_{V}=1$ and $A_{M}=1$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ss,base}} = \\frac{k_{p} (1)}{k_{d} (1)} = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{d}}\n$$\nThe new steady-state density, $P_{\\mathrm{ss,new}}$, corresponds to the perturbed state. The VPS34 activity decreases by a fractional amount $0.30$, so the new activity multiplier is $A_{V,\\text{new}} = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$. The MTM1 activity increases by a fractional amount $0.20$, so its new multiplier is $A_{M,\\text{new}} = 1 + 0.20 = 1.20$.\nSubstituting these new values into the general expression for $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ss,new}} = \\frac{k_{p} A_{V,\\text{new}}}{k_{d} A_{M,\\text{new}}} = \\frac{k_{p} (0.70)}{k_{d} (1.20)}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fold-change, which is the ratio $P_{\\mathrm{ss,new}} / P_{\\mathrm{ss,base}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{ss,new}}}{P_{\\mathrm{ss,base}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{p} (0.70)}{k_{d} (1.20)}}{\\frac{k_{p}}{k_{d}}}\n$$\nThe constants $k_{p}$ and $k_{d}$ cancel, simplifying the expression significantly.\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{ss,new}}}{P_{\\mathrm{ss,base}}} = \\frac{0.70}{1.20}\n$$\nThis ratio is equivalent to $\\frac{7}{12}$.

By applying principles of competitive binding and probability, you will determine how the length of a ubiquitin chain creates a sharp threshold for capture, a common strategy for increasing specificity in biological signaling [@problem_id:2942795].", "problem": "A transmembrane cargo destined for the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies is tagged with a Lysine-63–linked polyubiquitin chain of length $L$ (number of ubiquitin moieties).

The parameters provided ($K_d$ and concentrations) are within physiologically plausible ranges. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective and a complete set of assumptions and data required to construct a formal mathematical model based on the law of mass action and elementary probability theory. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum integer chain length $L$ such that the probability of capture, $P(\\text{capture})$, is at least $0.9$. The problem defines capture as the event where at least one ubiquitin moiety on the chain is bound. It is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event: that the cargo is *not* captured. This corresponds to the state where *all* $L$ ubiquitin moieties are unbound.\n\nLet $p_{\\text{unbound}}$ be the probability that a single, specific ubiquitin moiety is in an unbound state at steady state. According to Assumptions 1 and 2, the binding states of the $L$ moieties are independent events. Therefore, the probability that all $L$ moieties are simultaneously unbound is the product of their individual probabilities of being unbound:\n$$P(\\text{not captured}) = (p_{\\text{unbound}})^{L}$$\nThe probability of capture is then:\n$$P(\\text{capture}) = 1 - P(\\text{not captured}) = 1 - (p_{\\text{unbound}})^{L}$$\nOur task is to find the smallest integer $L$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$1 - (p_{\\text{unbound}})^{L} \\ge 0.9$$\nFirst, we must determine the value of $p_{\\text{unbound}}$. A single ubiquitin moiety ($U$) can exist in one of three states: unbound ($U$), bound to an ESCRT-0 UBD ($U \\cdot B_{0}$), or bound to an ESCRT-I UBD ($U \\cdot B_{I}$). The probability $p_{\\text{unbound}}$ is the fraction of ubiquitin moieties in the unbound state relative to the total population of states:\n$$p_{\\text{unbound}} = \\frac{[U]}{[U] + [U \\cdot B_{0}] + [U \\cdot B_{I}]}$$\nThe binding processes are governed by the law of mass action for competitive binding, as stated in Assumption 4.

The algebra is easier if we rearrange the inequality differently first:\n$$1 - 0.9 \\ge \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^{L}$$\n$$0.1 \\ge \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^{L}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\left(\\frac{8}{5}\\right)^{L} \\ge \\frac{1}{0.1}$$\n$$\\left(1.6\\right)^{L} \\ge 10$$\nNow, taking the natural logarithm of both sides.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with the analysis in three parts, as requested.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Model\n\nThe model describes the dynamics of the fractions of membrane-associated Rab5 and Rab7, denoted by $m_5(t)$ and $m_7(t)$ respectively. We begin by considering a single Rab species, say Rab5, whose total cellular amount is conserved. This total pool is partitioned into a membrane-associated, active, GTP-bound form and a cytosolic, inactive, GDP-bound form.\n\nLet $R_5^{\\text{mem}}(t)$ be the amount of membrane-associated Rab5 and $R_5^{\\text{cyto}}(t)$ be the amount of cytosolic Rab5. The total amount, $R_5^{\\text{total}}$, is constant: $R_5^{\\text{total}} = R_5^{\\text{mem}}(t) + R_5^{\\text{cyto}}(t)$. The state variable $m_5(t)$ is defined as the fraction of the total Rab5 pool that is on the membrane:\n$$\nm_5(t) = \\frac{R_5^{\\text{mem}}(t)}{R_5^{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nFrom this definition, it follows that the fraction of cytosolic Rab5 is $1 - m_5(t)$.\n\nThe temporal evolution of the amount of membrane-associated Rab5, $\\frac{d R_5^{\\text{mem}}}{dt}$, is governed by the balance of two fluxes: the rate of association from the cytosol to the membrane, $v_{\\text{on},5}$, and the rate of dissociation from the membrane back to the cytosol, $v_{\\text{off},5}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d R_5^{\\text{mem}}}{dt} = v_{\\text{on},5} - v_{\\text{off},5}\n$$\nThe association process is catalyzed by a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) and recruits Rab5 from the cytosolic pool. Thus, its rate is proportional to the amount of available cytosolic Rab5, $R_5^{\\text{cyto}}(t)$. The proportionality factor is an effective association rate function, $A_5(m_5, m_7)$, which encapsulates the regulation of GEF activity.\n$$\nv_{\\text{on},5} = A_5(m_5, m_7) \\cdot R_5^{\\text{cyto}}(t) = A_5(m_5, m_7) \\cdot R_5^{\\text{total}} (1 - m_5(t))\n$$\nThe dissociation process is accelerated by a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) and acts on the membrane-bound Rab5 pool. Its rate is proportional to the amount of membrane-associated Rab5, $R_5^{\\text{mem}}(t)$. The proportionality factor is an effective dissociation rate function, $D_5(m_5, m_7)$, which reflects the regulation of GAP activity.\n$$\nv_{\\text{off},5} = D_5(m_5, m_7) \\cdot R_5^{\\text{mem}}(t) = D_5(m_5, m_7) \\cdot R_5^{\\text{total}} m_5(t)\n$$\nBy substituting the definitions of $m_5(t)$ and the rate laws into the balance equation, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( R_5^{\\text{total}} m_5(t) \\right) = A_5(m_5, m_7) R_5^{\\text{total}} (1 - m_5) - D_5(m_5, m_7) R_5^{\\text{total}} m_5\n$$\nSince $R_5^{\\text{total}}$ is constant, we can divide by it to obtain the rate equation for the fraction $m_5$:\n$$\n\\frac{dm_5}{dt} = A_5(m_5, m_7) (1 - m_5) - D_5(m_5, m_7) m_5\n$$\nAn identical derivation holds for $m_7$, yielding the two-dimensional system structure.\n\nNext, we justify the specific forms of the rate functions $A_i$ and $D_i$. These functions model the regulatory network using Hill-type kinetics.\nFor the **association rate $A_5(m_5, m_7)$**:\nThis rate is proportional to the GEF activity for Rab5. The problem states this activity has a basal component, is auto-activated by membrane-bound Rab5 ($m_5$), and is inhibited by membrane-bound Rab7 ($m_7$).\n-   The total activity is a sum of a basal rate ($b_5$) and a self-activating term. The self-activation by $m_5$ is modeled by a saturating Hill function, $S(m_5;K_{55},n_{55})$, scaled by a coefficient $a_{55}$. This gives the term $\\big(b_5 + a_{55}\\,S(m_5;K_{55},n_{55})\\big)$.\n-   The inhibition by $m_7$ is modeled as a non-competitive inhibitory factor that divides the rate. The activity of the inhibitor is also represented by a Hill function, $S(m_7;K_{57},n_{57})$, scaled by a strength $i_{57}$. This gives the denominator $(1 + i_{57}\\,S(m_7;K_{57},n_{57}))$.\n-   Combining these with an overall rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on},5}$ yields the specified form for $A_5$.\n\nFor the **dissociation rate $D_5(m_7)$**:\nThis rate is proportional to the GAP activity for Rab5. This activity has a basal component and is increased by the antagonist Rab7.\n-   The total activity is the sum of a basal rate ($d_{50}$) and a term representing activation by $m_7$. This activation is described by the Hill function $S(m_7;K^{d}_{57},n^{d}_{57})$ scaled by a coefficient $d_{57}$.\n-   This gives the term $\\big(d_{50} + d_{57}\\,S(m_7;K^{d}_{57},n^{d}_{57})\\big)$, which is multiplied by the overall rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off},5}$ to give $D_5$.\n\nThe functions $A_7$ and $D_7$ are constructed with identical logic, reflecting the symmetric mutual antagonism between Rab5 and Rab7. This completes the derivation from the stated first principles.\n\n### 2. Phase-Plane and Stability Analysis\n\nThe steady states, or fixed points, $(m_5^\\ast, m_7^\\ast)$ of the system are found by setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dm_5}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dm_7}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThese two equations define the nullclines of the system in the $(m_5, m_7)$ phase plane. Steady states are the intersection points of these nullclines.\n\nThe $m_5$-nullcline is given by $A_5(m_5, m_7)(1 - m_5) - D_5(m_7) m_5 = 0$. Solving for $m_5$ gives:\n$$\nm_5 = \\frac{A_5(m_5, m_7)}{A_5(m_5, m_7) + D_5(m_7)}\n$$\nThis equation implicitly defines $m_5$ as a function of $m_7$. Because $A_5$ is a decreasing function of $m_7$ and $D_5$ is an increasing function of $m_7$, the resulting $m_5$ value is a monotonically decreasing function of $m_7$. However, due to the auto-activation term within $A_5$, this function can be S-shaped (sigmoidal) when plotted as a curve in the $(m_5, m_7)$-plane, particularly for high cooperativity $n_{55}$.\n\nSymmetrically, the $m_7$-nullcline is given by $m_7 = \\frac{A_7(m_5, m_7)}{A_7(m_5, m_7) + D_7(m_5)}$. This implicitly defines $m_7$ as a monotonically decreasing function of $m_5$, which can also be S-shaped for high cooperativity $n_{77}$.\n\nThe number of steady states depends on how these two generally decreasing curves intersect in the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n-   **Monostable, Graded Transition**: When cooperativity values ($n_{ii}$) are low (e.g., $n=1$) and feedback strengths are weak, the auto-activation is not strongly nonlinear. The nullclines are simple, non-sigmoidal decreasing curves. Two such curves can intersect at only one point. This single steady state is typically stable, and as parameters are varied, its position moves smoothly, representing a graded transition.\n-   **Bistable Transition**: When cooperativity is high (large $n_{ii}$) and feedback is strong (large $a_{ii}, i_{ij}, d_{ij}$), the positive feedback loop can make the nullclines S-shaped. The intersection of two S-shaped decreasing curves can result in three fixed points. These points typically correspond to two stable states and one unstable saddle point separating them. The stable states represent distinct endosomal identities: one with high $m_5$ and low $m_7$ (early endosome), and another with low $m_5$ and high $m_7$ (late endosome). This configuration permits a switch-like, hysteretic transition between states.\n\nTo determine the **linear stability** of a steady state $\\vec{m}^\\ast = (m_5^\\ast, m_7^\\ast)$, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the system evaluated at that point:\n$$\nJ(\\vec{m}^\\ast) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial (dm_5/dt)}{\\partial m_5} & \\frac{\\partial (dm_5/dt)}{\\partial m_7} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial (dm_7/dt)}{\\partial m_5} & \\frac{\\partial (dm_7/dt)}{\\partial m_7} \\end{pmatrix}_{\\vec{m}=\\vec{m}^\\ast}\n$$\nThe signs of the Jacobian elements are structurally determined:\n-   $J_{12} < 0$ and $J_{21} < 0$, representing mutual inhibition.\n-   $J_{11}$ and $J_{22}$ can be positive or negative, depending on the strength of auto-activation relative to the decay terms.\n\nA steady state is linearly stable if and only if all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J$ have strictly negative real parts. For a $2 \\times 2$ system, this is equivalent to requiring the trace of the Jacobian to be negative and the determinant to be positive:\n$$\n\\text{tr}(J) = J_{11} + J_{22} < 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\det(J) = J_{11}J_{22} - J_{12}J_{21} > 0\n$$\nIn the bistable case with three fixed points, the intersection points alternate in stability. The two outer fixed points are stable nodes ($\\text{tr}(J)<0, \\det(J)>0$), while the middle fixed point is a saddle ($\\det(J)<0$).\n\n### 3. Computational Strategy\n\nTo find and classify the steady states for the given parameter sets, we will implement a numerical algorithm that avoids time integration.\n1.  **System Definition**: For each parameter case, we define the vector function $\\vec{F}(\\vec{m}) = (dm_5/dt, dm_7/dt)^T$ and its Jacobian matrix $J(\\vec{m})$. The derivatives for the Jacobian are computed analytically.\n2.  **Root Finding**: We must find all roots of $\\vec{F}(\\vec{m}) = \\vec{0}$ within the domain $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$. Since numerical root-finding algorithms like Newton's method require an initial guess and converge to a single root, we must employ a multi-start strategy. We will generate a grid of initial guesses spanning the unit square (e.g., a $20 \\times 20$ grid). For each guess, we use the `scipy.optimize.root` function to find a fixed point.\n3.  **Filtering and Uniqueness**: Each result from the root-finder is validated. We accept a solution only if the solver reports success and the resulting point $(m_5^*, m_7^*)$ lies within the domain $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ (with a small tolerance). Valid solutions are stored, and duplicates are filtered out by comparing new solutions to existing ones using a numerical tolerance (e.g., via `numpy.allclose`).\n4.  **Stability Classification**: For each unique fixed point found, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix $J$ at that point. We then compute the eigenvalues of $J$ using `numpy.linalg.eigvals`. A fixed point is classified as linearly stable if the real parts of all its eigenvalues are strictly negative.\n5.  **Counting**: We count the number of distinct fixed points that satisfy the stability criterion. This process is repeated for each of the four parameter cases supplied in the test suite.
