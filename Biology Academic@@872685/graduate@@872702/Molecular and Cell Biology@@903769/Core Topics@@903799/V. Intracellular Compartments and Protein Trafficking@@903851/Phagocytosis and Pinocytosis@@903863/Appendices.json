The derivation shall proceed from the fundamental principles provided: the law of mass action for two-dimensional binding and the conservation of mass for both receptors and ligands.\n\nThe system is governed by the reversible one-to-one binding reaction between receptors, $R$, and ligands, $L$, to form a complex, $RL$:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nAt equilibrium, the relationship between the surface densities of the free and bound species is described by the two-dimensional dissociation constant, $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{\\rho_R^{\\mathrm{free}} \\rho_L^{\\mathrm{free}}}{\\rho_{RL}}$$\nwhere $\\rho_R^{\\mathrm{free}}$ is the density of free receptors, $\\rho_L^{\\mathrm{free}}$ is the density of free ligands, and $\\rho_{RL}$ is the density of the bound receptor-ligand complexes. The units of $K_D$ are molecules per unit area.\n\nThe total number of receptors and ligands within the contact area is conserved.

Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[X] = 0$. Similarly, $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\alpha \\mu \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sin\\phi_{i} = 0$. The mean of the total force vector is zero.\n\nThe variance of $X$ is calculated using the independence of the sectors:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} F_{i} \\cos\\phi_{i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(F_{i} \\cos\\phi_{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\cos^2\\phi_{i} \\mathrm{Var}(F_{i})\n$$\nThe variance of $F_{i}$ is $\\mathrm{Var}(F_{i}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\alpha n_{i}) = \\alpha^2 \\mathrm{Var}(n_{i})$. For a Poisson distribution, the variance equals the mean, so $\\mathrm{Var}(n_{i}) = \\mu$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(F_{i}) = \\alpha^2 \\mu\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(X)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\cos^2\\phi_{i} (\\alpha^2 \\mu) = \\alpha^2 \\mu \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\cos^2\\phi_{i}\n$$\nFor uniformly spaced angles, $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\cos^2\\phi_{i} = N/2$ for $N>2$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_X^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\frac{N \\alpha^2 \\mu}{2}\n$$\nBy identical logic, $\\sigma_Y^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\alpha^2 \\mu \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sin^2\\phi_{i} = \\frac{N \\alpha^2 \\mu}{2}$.\nThe covariance is $\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY] - \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[XY]$. Due to independence between sectors:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Cov}(F_i\\cos\\phi_i, F_i\\sin\\phi_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\cos\\phi_i\\sin\\phi_i \\mathrm{Var}(F_i) = \\alpha^2\\mu \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\phi_i) = 0\n$$\nAs $N$ is large, the central limit theorem implies that $X$ and $Y$ are independent, identically distributed normal random variables with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = N \\alpha^2 \\mu / 2$.\nThe magnitude of the total force, $S = |\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{tot}}| = \\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$, follows a Rayleigh distribution with scale parameter $\\sigma$. The expected value of a Rayleigh-distributed variable is $\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi/2}$.\nThe expected asymmetry is then:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[A] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{S}{N\\alpha\\mu}\\right] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[S]}{N\\alpha\\mu} = \\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi/2}}{N\\alpha\\mu}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma = \\sqrt{N\\alpha^2\\mu/2} = \\alpha\\sqrt{N\\mu/2}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[A] = \\frac{\\alpha\\sqrt{N\\mu/2} \\sqrt{\\pi/2}}{N\\alpha\\mu} = \\frac{\\alpha\\sqrt{N\\mu\\pi}/2}{N\\alpha\\mu} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{N\\mu}}\n$$\nNow, substitute the problem-specific parameters $L=2\\pi R$, $N = L/\\ell_c = 2\\pi R/\\ell_c$, and $\\mu = \\rho_{\\ell} f w \\ell_{c}$.\n$$\nN\\mu = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi R}{\\ell_c}\\right) (\\rho_{\\ell} f w \\ell_{c}) = 2\\pi R \\rho_{\\ell} f w\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[A]$ yields the first required closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[A] = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{2\\pi R \\rho_{\\ell} f w}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2 R \\rho_{\\ell} f w}}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Failure Probability $P_{\\mathrm{fail}}(f)$\n\nFailure is defined by the condition $A > A_c$. The probability of failure is $P_{\\mathrm{fail}}(f) = P(A > A_c)$.\n$$\nA = \\frac{S}{N\\alpha\\mu}\n$$\nThe condition $A > A_c$ is equivalent to $S > N\\alpha\\mu A_c$. The probability is given by the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the Rayleigh distribution. For a random variable $S$ with Rayleigh distribution, $P(S>s) = \\exp(-s^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{fail}}(f) = P(S > N\\alpha\\mu A_c) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(N\\alpha\\mu A_c)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstitute $\\sigma^2 = N\\alpha^2\\mu/2$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{fail}}(f) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{N^2\\alpha^2\\mu^2 A_c^2}{2(N\\alpha^2\\mu/2)}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{N^2\\alpha^2\\mu^2 A_c^2}{N\\alpha^2\\mu}\\right) = \\exp(-N\\mu A_c^2)\n$$\nFinally, substitute $N\\mu = 2\\pi R \\rho_{\\ell} f w$ to obtain the second required closed-form expression:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{fail}}(f) = \\exp(-2\\pi R \\rho_{\\ell} f w A_c^2)\n$$\n\nPart 3: Numerical Evaluation of $P_{\\mathrm{fail}}(f)$\n\nThe problem requires evaluation of $P_{\\mathrm{fail}}(f)$ using the following parameter values:\n- $f = 0.30$\n- $R = 1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $w = 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\rho_{\\ell} = 5.0 \\times 10^2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2} = 500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n- $A_c = 0.15$\n\nThe argument of the exponential function, which is dimensionless, is calculated first:\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = -2\\pi R \\rho_{\\ell} f w A_c^2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = -2\\pi (1.5) (500) (0.30) (0.10) (0.15)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = -2\\pi (1.5 \\times 500 \\times 0.30 \\times 0.10) (0.0225)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = -2\\pi (22.5) (0.0225)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = -2\\pi (0.50625) = -1.0125\\pi\n$$\nUsing the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$, the exponent is approximately:\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} \\approx -1.0125 \\times 3.14159265 \\approx -3.1808604...\n$$\nThe probability of failure is thus:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{fail}}(0.30) = \\exp(-3.1808604...) \\approx 0.04155041...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.04155$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.04155}\n$$", "id": "2958832"}]}
