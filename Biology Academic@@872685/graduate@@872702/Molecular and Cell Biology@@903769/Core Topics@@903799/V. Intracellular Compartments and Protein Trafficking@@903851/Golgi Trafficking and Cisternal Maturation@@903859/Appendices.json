This ensures a clean and computationally performant solution.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a two-compartment model of Golgi cisternal maturation\n    and calculates the time to polarization for different feedback gains.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0]  # Values for feedback gain 'g'\n\n    # Model parameters\n    s = 0.8\n    k_m = 0.08\n    gamma = 1.2\n    d_e = 0.03\n    k_e = 0.05\n    d_l = 0.04\n    k_r = 0.6\n    e_0 = 3.0\n    delta = 0.01\n\n    # Simulation parameters\n    T_max = 300.0\n    dt = 0.01\n    num_steps = int(T_max / dt)\n    \n    # Polarization criteria\n    phi_star = 0.2\n    epsilon = 1e-12\n\n    results = []\n\n    for g in test_cases:\n\n        # Initial conditions\n        e1_0 = e_0 * (1 + delta)\n        e2_0 = e_0 * (1 - delta)\n        l1_0 = 1.0\n        l2_0 = 1.0\n        \n        # State vector: [e1, e2, l1, l2]\n        y = np.array([e1_0, e2_0, l1_0, l2_0], dtype=np.float64)\n        \n        polarization_time = -1.0\n        \n        # COPI recruitment function\n        def f(e, gain, threshold):\n            return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-gain * (e - threshold)))\n\n        for i in range(num_steps):\n            e1, e2, l1, l2 = y\n\n            # Calculate derivatives (RHS of the ODEs)\n            \n            # de/dt\n            de1_dt = s - k_m * (1 + gamma * l1) * e1 - d_e * e1 + k_e * (e2 - e1)\n            de2_dt = s - k_m * (1 + gamma * l2) * e2 - d_e * e2 + k_e * (e1 - e2)\n            \n            # dl/dt\n            f_e1 = f(e1, g, e_0)\n            f_e2 = f(e2, g, e_0)\n            \n            retrieval_flow = k_r * (f_e1 * l1 - f_e2 * l2)\n            \n            dl1_dt = k_m * (1 + gamma * l1) * e1 - d_l * l1 - retrieval_flow\n            dl2_dt = k_m * (1 + gamma * l2) * e2 - d_l * l2 + retrieval_flow\n            \n            derivatives = np.array([de1_dt, de2_dt, dl1_dt, dl2_dt])\n\n            # Update state using Forward Euler method\n            y += derivatives * dt\n            \n            # Check for polarization\n            e1_new, e2_new, l1_new, l2_new = y\n            \n            e_diff = np.abs(e1_new - e2_new)\n            e_sum = e1_new + e2_new\n            l_diff = np.abs(l1_new - l2_new)\n            l_sum = l1_new + l2_new\n            \n            term1 = e_diff / max(e_sum, epsilon)\n            term2 = l_diff / max(l_sum, epsilon)\n            \n            phi = 0.5 * (term1 + term2)\n            \n            if phi >= phi_star:\n                polarization_time = (i + 1) * dt\n                break\n        \n        results.append(polarization_time)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.2f}\" for res in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\n# The function is defined but not called, to conform to the solution structure.\n# To get the answer, one would run:\n# solve()\n```", "answer": "[-1.00,240.24,124.62,64.21]", "id": "2947275"}]}
