The plus end undergoes dynamic instability with two kinetic states: growth at constant speed $v_{g}$ and shrinkage at constant speed $v_{s}$, and stochastic switching between these states. Catastrophes (growth to shrinkage) occur as a Poisson process with frequency $f_{c}$, and rescues (shrinkage to growth) occur as a Poisson process with frequency $f_{r}$. Assume the following:\n- The microtubule plus end position $x(t)\\ge 0$ evolves deterministically within each state with velocities $+v_{g}$ or $-v_{s}$, respectively.\n- Switching between states is memoryless with the above frequencies.\n- When $x(t)$ reaches $0$ while shrinking, the microtubule is instantaneously re-nucleated at $x=0$ in the growing state, maintaining a stationary ensemble (this enforces a constant total probability and avoids extinction).\n- There are no other boundaries; the space is semi-infinite, $x\\in[0,\\infty)$.\n\nStarting only from conservation of probability (continuity equations) and the definition of a continuous-time two-state Markov process, derive the steady-state length distribution for this model, and from it obtain the mean steady-state microtubule length $\\bar{L}$ when a normalizable steady state exists.

It is scientifically grounded in the widely accepted Dogterom-Leibler model of microtubule dynamic instability, is self-contained with all necessary parameters and boundary conditions, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction. We shall therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nLet $p_g(x)$ and $p_s(x)$ be the steady-state probability densities for finding a microtubule with its plus end at position $x$, in the growing and shrinking states, respectively. The total probability density is $p(x) = p_g(x) + p_s(x)$. The dynamics are governed by a set of coupled continuity equations, which express the conservation of probability for each state population.\n\nFor the growing state population, the change in probability density at a given position is determined by the flux of microtubules growing into and out of that position, and the stochastic switching to and from the shrinking state. In the steady state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), the continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} J_g(x) = -f_c p_g(x) + f_r p_s(x) $$\nwhere $J_g(x) = v_g p_g(x)$ is the probability flux for growing microtubules. Thus, we have:\n$$ v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = -f_c p_g(x) + f_r p_s(x) \\quad (1) $$\n\nFor the shrinking state population, the flux is $J_s(x) = -v_s p_s(x)$, and the corresponding steady-state continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} J_s(x) = f_c p_g(x) - f_r p_s(x) $$\nThis gives:\n$$ -v_s \\frac{d p_s}{dx} = f_c p_g(x) - f_r p_s(x) \\quad (2) $$\n\nComparing equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we observe that their right-hand sides are equal and opposite. This leads to:\n$$ v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = - \\left( -v_s \\frac{d p_s}{dx} \\right) \\implies v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} - v_s \\frac{d p_s}{dx} = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( v_g p_g(x) - v_s p_s(x) \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ v_g p_g(x) - v_s p_s(x) = J_0 $$\nwhere $J_0$ is a constant representing the total net probability flux along the length of the microtubule.\n\nFor a normalizable steady-state distribution to exist, the probability densities must vanish at infinity: $p_g(x \\to \\infty) \\to 0$ and $p_s(x \\to \\infty) \\to 0$. This implies that there can be no net flux of microtubules towards infinity. Therefore, the total flux constant $J_0$ must be zero.\n$$ J_0 = v_g p_g(x) - v_s p_s(x) = 0 $$\nThis provides a crucial algebraic relationship between the two probability densities for all $x  0$:\n$$ p_s(x) = \\frac{v_g}{v_s} p_g(x) \\quad (3) $$\n\nThe boundary condition at $x=0$ states that any microtubule shrinking to a length of zero is instantaneously re-nucleated in the growing state. This means the flux of shrinking microtubules arriving at $x=0$, given by $|J_s(0)| = v_s p_s(0)$, must equal the flux of growing microtubules originating from $x=0$, given by $J_g(0) = v_g p_g(0)$. The boundary condition is thus $v_g p_g(0) = v_s p_s(0)$. This is automatically satisfied by the zero-flux condition evaluated at $x=0$.\n\nWe can now solve for the functional form of the distributions. Substitute equation $(3)$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$ v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = -f_c p_g(x) + f_r \\left(\\frac{v_g}{v_s} p_g(x)\\right) $$\n$$ v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{f_r v_g}{v_s} - f_c\\right) p_g(x) $$\n$$ \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{f_r}{v_s} - \\frac{f_c}{v_g}\\right) p_g(x) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, whose solution is an exponential function:\n$$ p_g(x) = A \\exp\\left[ \\left(\\frac{f_r}{v_s} - \\frac{f_c}{v_g}\\right) x \\right] $$\nwhere $A$ is an integration constant. Let us define the decay parameter $\\lambda = \\frac{f_c}{v_g} - \\frac{f_r}{v_s}$. Then the solution becomes $p_g(x) = A \\exp(-\\lambda x)$.\n\nThe total probability density is $p(x) = p_g(x) + p_s(x) = p_g(x) + \\frac{v_g}{v_s} p_g(x) = (1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s})p_g(x)$.\n$$ p(x) = A \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda x) $$\nFor this distribution to be normalizable over the domain $x \\in [0, \\infty)$, the integral $\\int_0^\\infty p(x) dx$ must converge to a finite value. This requires the argument of the exponential to be strictly negative, which means $\\lambda  0$.\nThe condition for the existence of a normalizable steady state is therefore:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{f_c}{v_g} - \\frac{f_r}{v_s}  0 \\iff f_c v_s  f_r v_g $$\nIf this condition holds, we can determine the constant $A$ by normalizing the total probability to $1$:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty p(x) dx = \\int_0^\\infty A \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda x) dx = 1 $$\n$$ A \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\right]_0^\\infty = 1 $$\n$$ A \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\right) = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{\\lambda}{1 + v_g/v_s} $$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the expression for $p(x)$ gives the normalized steady-state length distribution:\n$$ p(x) = \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{1 + v_g/v_s} \\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda x) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) $$\nThis is a simple exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nThe mean steady-state microtubule length, $\\bar{L}$, is the expectation value of $x$ for this distribution:\n$$ \\bar{L} = \\langle x \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty x p(x) dx = \\int_0^\\infty x \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) dx $$\nThe mean of an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$ is $1/\\lambda$.

The problem does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires relating a temporal process, GTP hydrolysis, to a spatial distribution, the fluorescence intensity profile. The link between the time domain and the spatial domain is the constant growth velocity of the microtubule, $v_g$.\n\nLet $P(t)$ be the fraction of tubulin subunits that are in the pre-hydrolytic, GTP-bound state at a time $t$ after their incorporation into the microtubule lattice. According to the problem statement, GTP hydrolysis is a first-order process with rate constant $k_h$. The rate of change of the GTP-tubulin fraction is therefore described by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = -k_h P(t)\n$$\nAt the moment of incorporation into the growing microtubule tip (at $t=0$), all subunits are in the GTP-bound state, so the initial condition is $P(0) = 1$. The solution to this first-order linear ordinary differential equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$\nP(t) = P(0) \\exp(-k_h t) = \\exp(-k_h t)\n$$\nThis equation describes the probability that a tubulin subunit, incorporated at $t=0$, remains in the GTP state at a later time $t$.\n\nThe microtubule plus end grows at a constant speed $v_g$. A segment of the microtubule lattice at a distance $x$ from the growing tip was incorporated at a time $t$ in the past. This time is given by the simple kinematic relation:\n$$\nt = \\frac{x}{v_g}\n$$\nWe can substitute this expression for time into the equation for $P(t)$ to find the fraction of GTP-tubulin as a function of position $x$ from the tip:\n$$\nP(x) = \\exp\\left(-k_h \\frac{x}{v_g}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h}{v_g} x\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the EB protein preferentially binds to the pre-hydrolytic state, and that the measured fluorescence intensity, $I(x)$, is proportional to the EB occupancy.

We equate the coefficients of $x$ in the exponents:\n$$\n\\frac{k_h}{v_g} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSolving for the hydrolysis rate constant $k_h$, we obtain the required expression:\n$$\nk_h = \\frac{v_g}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of $k_h$ using the provided data: $v_g = 0.90\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\lambda = 0.240\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nk_h = \\frac{0.90\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.240\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\nThe units of $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the unit $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is correct for a first-order rate constant.

Let the tip retreat along the lattice from position $x=0$ at time $t=0$ toward increasing $x$, with an approximately constant shrinkage speed $v_{\\mathrm{shrink}}$ over the distances of interest. Consider the following base facts and definitions appropriate to this system: (i) dynamic instability switches (catastrophe and rescue) can be modeled as memoryless events; (ii) in a memoryless model, an event occurring along a coordinate (here, distance traveled by the tip) is described by a hazard per unit coordinate, so that a local rescue propensity can be represented by a spatially dependent hazard $h(x)$ per unit distance traveled; (iii) End-Binding proteins (EBs) preferentially bind to regions of the microtubule lattice with Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP)-like conformation (including Guanosine Diphosphate with inorganic phosphate, $\\text{GDP-P}_i$), and EB occupancy increases monotonically with the local fraction of such GTP-like subunits at subsaturating EB concentrations.\n\nSuppose there is a single “GTP island” in the lattice: an interval $[a,a+w]$ with $0aa+w\\le L$, within which the local lattice maintains a GTP-like geometry.

Under the spatially inhomogeneous hazard model specified above, the probability that at least one rescue occurs before the tip has retracted distance $L$ equals $1-\\exp\\!\\big(-h_0(L-w)-h_1 w\\big)$; therefore, relative to a homogeneous lattice with hazard $h_0$ everywhere, the presence of the island increases the rescue probability when $h_1h_0$.\n\nB.

If the hazard outside the island is reduced from $h_0$ to $h_{\\mathrm{out}}$ such that $h_{\\mathrm{out}}(L-w)+h_1 w=h_0 L$ (holding fixed the length-integrated hazard over $[0,L]$), then the probability of at least one rescue before retraction of distance $L$ is identical to that of a homogeneous lattice with hazard $h_0$ everywhere; in this memoryless model, inhomogeneity by itself does not alter the rescue probability when the line integral $\\int_0^L h(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ is held fixed.\n\nD.

At subsaturating EB concentrations, the local EB occupancy is a monotone increasing function of the local fraction of GTP-like subunits. Thus, a localized GTP island generates a local EB enrichment (a peak in EB fluorescence intensity) over that island.\n\nWe analyze each option:\n\nOption A. The first clause states that EB intensity will show a local maximum over the island because EB binds preferentially to GTP-like lattice. This follows directly from the affinity preference: a region with elevated GTP-like fraction increases EB occupancy locally. For the second clause, with $h(x)=h_0$ outside the island and $h(x)=h_1$ inside $[a,a+w]$, the line integral is\n$$\n\\int_0^L h(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\n= h_0(L-w)+h_1 w,\n$$\nbecause $[a,a+w]$ has length $w$ and the remainder of $[0,L]$ has length $L-w$. Therefore\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{rescue}}(L)\n=1-\\exp\\!\\big(-h_0(L-w)-h_1 w\\big).\n$$\nRelative to a homogeneous lattice with hazard $h_0$ everywhere, whose rescue probability is $1-\\exp(-h_0 L)$, the presence of an island with $h_1h_0$ increases $P_{\\mathrm{rescue}}(L)$ because the exponent becomes more negative: $-h_0(L-w)-h_1 w-h_0 L$. Using the provided numbers, the inhomogeneous integral is $0.03\\times(5.0-0.20)+0.30\\times 0.20=0.144+0.060=0.204$, so $P_{\\mathrm{rescue}}^{\\mathrm{island}}=1-e^{-0.204}\\approx 0.185$. The homogeneous baseline gives $0.03\\times 5.0=0.150$, so $P_{\\mathrm{rescue}}^{\\mathrm{homog}}=1-e^{-0.150}\\approx 0.139$. Hence the island increases the rescue probability under the stated model and parameters. Option A is Correct.\n\nOption B. This asserts that EB binding is spatially uniform because EB recognizes curvature rather than nucleotide state. This contradicts the stated and well-supported molecular recognition: EB proteins prefer GTP-like lattice states (including GDP$\\text{-}\\mathrm{P_i}$) and produce comets at growing ends due to a nucleotide-state gradient; they also mark GTP islands along the lattice. Therefore a GTP island will produce local EB enrichment; the claim of uniformity is false. Option B is Incorrect.\n\nOption C. Here we compare two scenarios with the same line integral of the hazard over $[0,L]$: (i) homogeneous $h_0$ everywhere; (ii) inhomogeneous $h(x)=h_{\\mathrm{out}}$ outside and $h(x)=h_1$ on the island, chosen so that $h_{\\mathrm{out}}(L-w)+h_1 w=h_0 L$. From the survival derivation above,\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{rescue}}(L)=1-\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\int_0^L h(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\\Big)\n$$\ndepends only on the integral, not on how $h(x)$ is distributed spatially along $[0,L]$, because the governing differential equation $S'(x)=-h(x)S(x)$ integrates to the same $S(L)$ for any $h(x)$ sharing the same integral. Thus, by construction, the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases have identical $P_{\\mathrm{rescue}}(L)$. In other words, inhomogeneity per se does not alter the rescue probability if the line integral $\\int_0^L h(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ is held fixed. Option C is Correct.\n\nOption D. The probability that rescue occurs specifically within the island equals the probability of no rescue before $x=a$ times the conditional probability of rescue within the next $w$ micrometers at hazard $h_1$. Using the survival function on $[0,a]$, the probability to reach $x=a$ without rescue is\n$$\nS(a)=\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\int_0^a h(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u\\Big)=\\exp(-h_0 a),\n$$\nsince $h(x)=h_0$ on $[0,a)$. Conditional on arrival at $x=a$, the probability of rescue within $[a,a+w]$ is $1-\\exp(-h_1 w)$, because the survival over width $w$ at constant hazard $h_1$ is $\\exp(-h_1 w)$.

Option D is Correct.\n\nOption E. The statement asserts that EB binding within the island necessarily reduces $v_{\\mathrm{shrink}}$ so dramatically that a distance-based hazard model becomes invalid, precluding capture of island effects without explicit speed modeling. The premises we are allowed to use include that $v_{\\mathrm{shrink}}$ is approximately constant to leading order over the distances of interest and that EB preferentially binds GTP-like lattice; no necessity of large speed changes is implied. Empirically, while EBs and GTP-like patches can modulate dynamics, there is no requirement that EB-induced changes in $v_{\\mathrm{shrink}}$ be so large as to invalidate a distance-based hazard representation; moreover, even if the speed varied, one could equivalently describe the process with a time-hazard $\\lambda(t)$ or retain a distance-hazard $h(x)$ provided the mapping between time and distance is accounted for. Under the stated assumptions, the model remains valid, and the claim of necessary invalidation is incorrect. Option E is Incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the correct statements are A, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2954159"}]}
