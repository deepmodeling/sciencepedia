A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by establishing the kinetic equations for each end of the actin filament and solving for the condition of zero net growth in average filament length.\n\nFirst, we analyze the barbed-end capping dynamics. The barbed end exists in two states: uncapped ($U$) and capped ($C$). The transition between these states is governed by a reversible reaction:\n$$ U + \\text{Cap} \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}]}{\\rightleftharpoons}} C $$\nLet $P_U$ and $P_C$ be the probabilities (or steady-state fractions of time) that the barbed end is uncapped and capped, respectively. At steady state for the capping reaction, the rate of capping must equal the rate of uncapping:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] P_U = k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}} P_C $$\nGiven that the probabilities must sum to unity, $P_U + P_C = 1$, we can write $P_C = 1 - P_U$. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] P_U = k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}} (1 - P_U) $$\nSolving for $P_U$:\n$$ (k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}) P_U = k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}} $$\n$$ P_U = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} $$\nThis expression gives the fraction of time the barbed end is available for growth.\n\nNext, we define the net rates of subunit addition at each end. The rates are given in subunits per second.\nThe net rate of subunit addition at the barbed end, $J_b$, is non-zero only when it is uncapped. When capped, the rate is zero. The time-averaged net rate, $\\langle J_b \\rangle$, is therefore:\n$$ \\langle J_b \\rangle = (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) P_U + (0) P_C = (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) P_U $$\nThe net rate of subunit addition at the pointed end, $J_p$, is independent of the barbed end state. It is given by:\n$$ J_p = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{p,\\mathrm{eff}} $$\nUsing the provided definition for the effective pointed-end dissociation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{p,\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}]$, we have:\n$$ J_p = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] - (k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}]) $$\n\nThe problem defines the treadmilling steady state as the condition where the average filament length is constant. This requires the total net rate of change of length, which is the sum of the rates at both ends, to be zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\langle L \\rangle}{dt} = \\langle J_b \\rangle + J_p = 0 $$\nThis implies that the time-averaged net addition at the barbed end must exactly balance the net loss at the pointed end:\n$$ \\langle J_b \\rangle = -J_p $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\langle J_b \\rangle$ and $J_p$:\n$$ (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) P_U = -(k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] - (k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}])) $$\n$$ (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) P_U = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}] - k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $P_U$:\n$$ (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} \\right) = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}] - k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] $$\nWe must now solve this equation for the unknown capping protein concentration, $[\\mathrm{Cap}]$. Let us define the net uncapped barbed-end growth rate as $\\Delta J_b = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}$ and the net pointed-end loss rate as $\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}} = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}] - k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D]$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta J_b \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} \\right) = \\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $[\\mathrm{Cap}]$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J_b}{\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J_b}{\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}]}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} + 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}]}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} = \\frac{\\Delta J_b}{\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}}} - 1 $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{Cap}] = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta J_b}{\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}}} - 1 \\right) $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for $[\\mathrm{Cap}]$.\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values provided.

The ODE becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{dt} + \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}}F = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}}{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}}(k_{\\mathrm{sf}}rt + \\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}r) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE of the form $\\frac{dF}{dt} + aF = ct+b$, with constants:\n$$ a = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}} \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\tau} $$\n$$ c = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}k_{\\mathrm{sf}}r}{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}} $$\n$$ b = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}r}{2} $$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $F_{h}(t) = C\\exp(-t/\\tau)$ and a particular solution $F_{p}(t)$. We seek a particular solution of the form $F_{p}(t) = K_{1}t + K_{0}$. Substituting into the ODE yields:\n$K_{1} + a(K_{1}t + K_{0}) = ct+b$. Equating coefficients of $t$ gives $aK_{1}=c \\implies K_{1} = c/a = c\\tau$. Equating constant terms gives $K_{1}+aK_{0}=b \\implies K_{0} = (b-K_{1})/a = \\tau(b-c\\tau)$.\nLet's express $K_0$ and $K_1$ using the physical parameters.\n$$ K_{1} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}k_{\\mathrm{sf}}r}{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}} \\cdot \\frac{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}k_{\\mathrm{sf}}r}{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}} $$\n$$ K_{0} = \\tau b - K_{1}\\tau = \\frac{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}} \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}r}{2} - K_1 \\tau = \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}r}{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}} - \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}k_{\\mathrm{sf}}r \\cdot 2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{(K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}})^2} $$\n$$ K_{0} = \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}r(K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}) - 2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}k_{\\mathrm{sf}}r}{(K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}})^2} = \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}K_{\\mathrm{fa}}^{2}L_{0}r}{(K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}})^2} $$\nThe general solution is $F(t) = C\\exp(-t/\\tau) + K_{1}t + K_{0}$.\nApplying the initial condition $F(0)=0$:\n$F(0) = C + K_{0} = 0 \\implies C = -K_{0}$.\nThe complete solution for the force is:\n$$ F(t) = K_{0}(1-\\exp(-t/\\tau)) + K_{1}t $$\nwhere $\\tau = \\frac{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}}$, $K_{0} = \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}}K_{\\mathrm{fa}}^{2}L_{0}r}{(K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}})^2}$, and $K_{1} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}L_{0}k_{\\mathrm{sf}}r}{K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$k_{\\mathrm{sf}} = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n$\\eta_{\\mathrm{sf}} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n$K_{\\mathrm{fa}} = 0.005\\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n$L_{0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$t = 60\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator term:\n$K_{\\mathrm{fa}}+2k_{\\mathrm{sf}} = 0.005 + 2(0.01) = 0.025\\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, calculate the characteristic time $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{2 \\times 1.0}{0.025} = 80\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nNow, calculate the coefficients $K_{0}$ and $K_{1}$:\n$$ K_{0} = \\frac{1.0 \\times (0.005)^2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{(0.025)^2} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 10^{-12}}{6.25 \\times 10^{-4}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\n$$ K_{1} = \\frac{0.005 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 0.01 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{0.025} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-12}}{0.025} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNow we calculate $F(t)$ for $t=60\\ \\mathrm{s}$:\n$$ F(60) = (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})(1 - \\exp(-60/80)) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-10})(60) $$\n$$ F(60) = (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})(1 - \\exp(-0.75)) + 6.0 \\times 10^{-9} $$\n$$ \\exp(-0.75) \\approx 0.47236655 $$\n$$ F(60) \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})(1 - 0.47236655) + 6.0 \\times 10^{-9} $$\n$$ F(60) \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})(0.52763345) + 6.0 \\times 10^{-9} $$\n$$ F(60) \\approx 1.0552669 \\times 10^{-9} + 6.0 \\times 10^{-9} = 7.0552669 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\nThe force is requested in nanonewtons ($1\\ \\mathrm{nN} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{N}$).\n$$ F(60) \\approx 7.0552669\\ \\mathrm{nN} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $7.055\\ \\mathrm{nN}$.\nThe question asks for the magnitude of the force transmitted through each focal adhesion, which is $F(t)$.
