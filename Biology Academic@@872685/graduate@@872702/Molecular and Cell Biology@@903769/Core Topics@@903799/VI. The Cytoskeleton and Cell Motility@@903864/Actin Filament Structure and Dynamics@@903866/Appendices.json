A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the principles of mass-action kinetics to the actin filament ends. The net rate of subunit addition, $J$, at a filament end is given by the difference between the association rate ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}C$) and the dissociation rate ($k_{\\mathrm{off}}$):\n$$J = k_{\\mathrm{on}}C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\nThe critical concentration, $C_c$, is the monomer concentration at which the net rate of subunit addition is zero ($J=0$), which yields:\n$$C_c = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the critical concentrations for the barbed end ($C_{c,b}$) and the pointed end ($C_{c,p}$) using the specified rate constants.\nFor the barbed end (ATP-actin):\n$$C_{c,b} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},b}^{\\mathrm{T}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},b}} = \\frac{1.40 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{11.6 \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.1207 \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nFor the pointed end (ADP-actin):\n$$C_{c,p} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},p}^{\\mathrm{D}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},p}} = \\frac{0.80 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.30 \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.6154 \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe given monomer concentration is $C = 0.30 \\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Comparing this concentration with the critical concentrations, we find:\n$$C_{c,b} \\approx 0.1207 \\mu\\mathrm{M}  C = 0.30 \\mu\\mathrm{M}  C_{c,p} \\approx 0.6154 \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nAccording to the explicit convention provided in the problem statement, \"treadmill if $C_{c,b}  C  C_{c,p}$\", the dynamic regime is classified as treadmilling. This is because the concentration of free monomers is sufficient to drive net polymerization at the barbed end ($C  C_{c,b}$) but insufficient to prevent net depolymerization at the pointed end ($C  C_{c,p}$).\n\nNext, we compute the net rate of change in filament length. This requires calculating the net rate of subunit addition at each end.\nThe net rate of subunit addition at the barbed end, $J_b$, is:\n$$J_b = k_{\\mathrm{on},b}C - k_{\\mathrm{off},b}^{\\mathrm{T}} = (11.6 \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.30 \\mu\\mathrm{M}) - 1.40 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$J_b = 3.48 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 1.40 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 2.08 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe net rate of subunit addition at the pointed end, $J_p$, is:\n$$J_p = k_{\\mathrm{on},p}C - k_{\\mathrm{off},p}^{\\mathrm{D}} = (1.30 \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.30 \\mu\\mathrm{M}) - 0.80 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$J_p = 0.39 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 0.80 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = -0.41 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe total net rate of change in the number of subunits in the filament, $J_{\\mathrm{net}}$, is the sum of the rates at both ends:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{net}} = J_b + J_p = 2.08 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 0.41 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 1.67 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThis positive value indicates a net increase in the total number of subunits in the filament per second.\nFinally, the rate of change of the filament's length, $\\frac{dL}{dt}$, is obtained by multiplying the net subunit addition rate by the axial length per subunit, $d = 2.70 \\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$\\frac{dL}{dt} = J_{\\mathrm{net}} \\times d = (1.67 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.70 \\mathrm{nm})$$\n$$\\frac{dL}{dt} = 4.509 \\mathrm{nm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $4.509$ already has four significant figures.

Since binding is at rapid equilibrium, the probability of a site being occupied is given by the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$ p(\\text{bind} | S) = \\frac{C}{C + K_D^S} $$\nwhere $S$ is the nucleotide state. The given dissociation constants are $K_D^{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\gamma K_0$, $K_D^{\\mathrm{ADP\\cdot Pi}} = \\beta K_0$, and $K_D^{\\mathrm{ADP}} = K_0$. The conditional probabilities are:\n$$ p(\\text{bind} | \\text{ATP}) = \\frac{C}{C + \\gamma K_0} $$\n$$ p(\\text{bind} | \\text{ADP}\\cdot\\text{Pi}) = \\frac{C}{C + \\beta K_0} $$\n$$ p(\\text{bind} | \\text{ADP}) = \\frac{C}{C + K_0} $$\nThe total probability of finding a subunit at time $t$ bound to cofilin, $p_{\\mathrm{bind}}(t)$, is given by the law of total probability:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{bind}}(t) = P_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(t)p(\\text{bind} | \\text{ATP}) + P_{\\mathrm{ADP\\cdot Pi}}(t)p(\\text{bind} | \\text{ADP}\\cdot\\text{Pi}) + P_{\\mathrm{ADP}}(t)p(\\text{bind} | \\text{ADP}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{bind}}(t) = \\exp(-k_h t) \\left( \\frac{C}{C + \\gamma K_0} \\right) + \\frac{k_h}{k_r - k_h} \\left(\\exp(-k_h t) - \\exp(-k_r t)\\right) \\left( \\frac{C}{C + \\beta K_0} \\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{k_r}{k_r - k_h}\\exp(-k_h t) + \\frac{k_h}{k_r - k_h}\\exp(-k_r t)\\right) \\left( \\frac{C}{C + K_0} \\right) $$\nTo obtain the desired position-dependent probability $p_{\\mathrm{bind}}(x)$, we substitute $t = x/v$:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{bind}}(x) = \\frac{C}{C + K_0} + \\left( \\frac{C}{C + \\gamma K_0} \\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h x}{v}\\right) + \\frac{Ck_h}{(k_r - k_h)(C + \\beta K_0)} \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h x}{v}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_r x}{v}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{Ck_r}{(k_r - k_h)(C + K_0)}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h x}{v}\\right) + \\frac{Ck_h}{(k_r - k_h)(C + K_0)}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_r x}{v}\\right) $$\nWe group the terms by the constant and the two exponentials, $\\exp(-k_h x/v)$ and $\\exp(-k_r x/v)$.\nThe constant term is $\\frac{C}{C + K_0}$.\nThe coefficient of $\\exp(-k_h x/v)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{C}{C + \\gamma K_0} + \\frac{Ck_h}{(k_r - k_h)(C + \\beta K_0)} - \\frac{Ck_r}{(k_r - k_h)(C + K_0)} $$\nThe coefficient of $\\exp(-k_r x/v)$ is:\n$$ -\\frac{Ck_h}{(k_r - k_h)(C + \\beta K_0)} + \\frac{Ck_h}{(k_r - k_h)(C + K_0)} = \\frac{Ck_h}{k_r - k_h}\\left(\\frac{1}{C + K_0} - \\frac{1}{C + \\beta K_0}\\right) $$\nCombining these gives the final expression for the position-dependent binding probability.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{bind}}(x) = \\frac{C}{C+K_0} + \\left(\\frac{C}{C+\\gamma K_0} + \\frac{C}{k_r-k_h}\\left(\\frac{k_h}{C+\\beta K_0} - \\frac{k_r}{C+K_0}\\right)\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h x}{v}\\right) + \\frac{Ck_h}{k_r-k_h}\\left(\\frac{1}{C+K_0} - \\frac{1}{C+\\beta K_0}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_r x}{v}\\right) $$\nThis is the explicit, closed-form analytical expression required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p_{\\mathrm{bind}}(x) = \\frac{C}{C+K_0} + \\left[\\frac{C}{C+\\gamma K_0} + \\frac{C}{k_r-k_h}\\left(\\frac{k_h}{C+\\beta K_0} - \\frac{k_r}{C+K_0}\\right)\\right]\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h x}{v}\\right) + \\left[\\frac{Ck_h}{k_r-k_h}\\left(\\frac{1}{C+K_0} - \\frac{1}{C+\\beta K_0}\\right)\\right]\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_r x}{v}\\right)}$$", "id": "2930641"}]}
