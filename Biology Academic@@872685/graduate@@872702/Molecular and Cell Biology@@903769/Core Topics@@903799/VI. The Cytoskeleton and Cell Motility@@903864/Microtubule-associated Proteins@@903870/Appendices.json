It guides the solver by first asking for the derivation of the basic comet length $L$ before introducing the modification by the MAP. The definitions are unambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically valid, objective, and well-posed. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem rests on translating the temporal description of a biochemical process (hydrolysis) into a spatial distribution along a structure growing at a constant velocity.\n\nFirst, we establish the probability, $P(x)$, that a tubulin subunit at a distance $x$ from the growing microtubule tip remains in the EB-competent state. The problem states that the age, $t$, of a subunit at distance $x$ from the tip is given by:\n$$\nt = \\frac{x}{v_g}\n$$\nThis relation holds because the microtubule is assumed to grow at a constant velocity $v_g$.\n\nThe problem also states that the hydrolysis of the EB-competent state is a first-order, memoryless process. The probability that a subunit survives in this state for a duration $t$ is given by the survival function for a Poisson process:\n$$\nP_{survival}(t) = \\exp(-k_h t)\n$$\nwhere $k_h$ is the rate constant of hydrolysis.\n\nTo find the probability $P(x)$ as a function of distance, we substitute the expression for age $t(x)$ into the survival probability function:\n$$\nP(x) = \\exp\\left(-k_h \\frac{x}{v_g}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation gives the probability profile of the EB-competent state along the microtubule lattice, decaying exponentially from the tip.\n\nThe comet length, $L$, is operationally defined as the mean spatial extent of this EB-competent region, calculated by integrating this probability distribution over all possible distances $x$ from the tip ($x \\ge 0$):\n$$\nL = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} P(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h}{v_g} x\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nThis is a standard exponential integral. The solution is:\n$$\nL = \\left[ -\\frac{v_g}{k_h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h}{v_g} x\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\nEvaluating the integral at its limits:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{v_g}{k_h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h}{v_g} x\\right)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{v_g}{k_h} \\exp(0)\\right)\n$$\nSince $k_h > 0$ and $v_g > 0$, the exponential term approaches $0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nL = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{v_g}{k_h}\\right) = \\frac{v_g}{k_h}\n$$\nThe problem requests an interpretation of this result in terms of a GTP-cap lifetime, $\\tau$. For a first-order decay process with rate constant $k_h$, the mean lifetime of the state is its reciprocal, $\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_h}$. Substituting this into the expression for $L$ yields $L = v_g \\tau$. This has a clear physical interpretation: the average length of the comet is the distance the microtubule tip grows during the average lifetime of one EB-competent (GTP) subunit.\n\nNow, we consider the effect of the MAP. The MAP modifies the hydrolysis rate to $k_h' = \\alpha k_h$, while the growth velocity $v_g$ remains unchanged. We are asked to find the new comet length, $L'$. The derivation follows precisely the same logic as before, but with the rate constant $k_h$ replaced by $k_h'$.\n\nThe new probability distribution is:\n$$\nP'(x) = \\exp\\left(-k_h' \\frac{x}{v_g}\\right)\n$$\nThe new comet length $L'$ is the integral of this new probability distribution:\n$$\nL' = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h'}{v_g} x\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nSolving this integral in the same manner yields:\n$$\nL' = \\frac{v_g}{k_h'}\n$$\nFinally, we must express $L'$ in terms of the original parameters $v_g$, $k_h$, and the dimensionless factor $\\alpha$. We substitute the given relation $k_h' = \\alpha k_h$:\n$$\nL' = \\frac{v_g}{\\alpha k_h}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the modified comet length. If $\\alpha > 1$, the MAP is a hydrolysis-accelerating factor, which shortens the comet. If $0  \\alpha  1$, the MAP is a hydrolysis-inhibiting factor, which lengthens the comet. The result is dimensionally correct, as $v_g/k_h$ has units of length and $\\alpha$ is dimensionless.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{v_g}{\\alpha k_h}}\n$$", "id": "2954405"}, {"introduction": "Quantitative cell biology relies on our ability to translate microscopic images into precise molecular numbers.

This means that the graph of $v_g(L)$ must be steeper than the graph of $u(L)$ at their intersection point, ensuring that $v_g(L)$ crosses $u(L)$ from above.\n\nThe condition can be stated as:\n$$\\dfrac{v_{g0}\\gamma \\lambda}{(1 + \\gamma \\lambda L^{\\ast})^2}  \\dfrac{F_{m}\\xi \\lambda}{(\\xi_{0} + \\xi \\lambda L^{\\ast})^2}$$\nTo eliminate $L^{\\ast}$ and find a condition purely on the parameters, we can rearrange this inequality and use the steady-state condition $v_g(L^{\\ast}) = u(L^{\\ast})$.\n$$\\dfrac{v_{g0}\\gamma}{F_m\\xi}  \\left(\\dfrac{1 + \\gamma \\lambda L^{\\ast}}{\\xi_{0} + \\xi \\lambda L^{\\ast}}\\right)^2$$\nFrom the steady-state condition, we have $\\dfrac{v_{g0}}{F_m} = \\dfrac{1 + \\gamma \\lambda L^{\\ast}}{\\xi_{0} + \\xi \\lambda L^{\\ast}}$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$\\dfrac{v_{g0}\\gamma}{F_m\\xi}  \\left(\\dfrac{v_{g0}}{F_m}\\right)^2$$\nAssuming $v_{g0}0$ and $F_m0$, we can multiply by $F_m/v_{g0}$:\n$$\\dfrac{\\gamma}{\\xi}  \\dfrac{v_{g0}}{F_m}$$\nRearranging provides the final sign condition for stability:\n$$v_{g0}\\xi  F_{m}\\gamma$$\nThis condition ensures that at large overlap lengths, the sliding speed $u(L)$ decreases more slowly than the growth speed $v_g(L)$, which provides the necessary negative feedback to stabilize the overlap length.\n\n3. Numerical computation of $L^{\\ast}$.\n\nUsing the derived expression for $L^{\\ast}$ and the given parameter values:\n$v_{g0} = 0.5$ $\\mu \\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{min}$\n$F_{m} = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{pN}$\n$\\xi_{0} = 2.4$ $\\mathrm{pN}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}/\\mu \\mathrm{m}$\n$\\xi = 1.1$ $\\mathrm{pN}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}/(\\mu \\mathrm{m}\\cdot \\mathrm{complex})$\n$\\lambda = 5$ $\\mathrm{complex}/\\mu \\mathrm{m}$\n$\\gamma = 0.56$ $\\mathrm{complex}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we compute the numerator, $F_{m} - v_{g0}\\xi_{0}$:\n$$1.0 - (0.5)(2.4) = 1.0 - 1.2 = -0.2$$\nNext, we compute the term in the denominator, $v_{g0}\\xi - F_{m}\\gamma$:\n$$(0.5)(1.1) - (1.0)(0.56) = 0.55 - 0.56 = -0.01$$\nThe full denominator is $\\lambda(v_{g0}\\xi - F_{m}\\gamma)$:\n$$5(-0.01) = -0.05$$\nNow we can compute $L^{\\ast}$:\n$$L^{\\ast} = \\dfrac{-0.2}{-0.05} = 4$$\nThe units are consistent, resulting in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The problem requests the answer rounded to three significant figures, which is $4.00$. Both the numerator and denominator are negative, satisfying the condition for $L^{\\ast}0$. The stability condition $v_{g0}\\xi  F_{m}\\gamma$ is also satisfied ($0.55  0.56$).\n\nFinal answers are collected into a single matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\dfrac{F_{m} - v_{g0}\\xi_{0}}{\\lambda (v_{g0}\\xi - F_{m}\\gamma)}  v_{g0}\\xi  F_{m}\\gamma  4.00 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2954444"}]}
