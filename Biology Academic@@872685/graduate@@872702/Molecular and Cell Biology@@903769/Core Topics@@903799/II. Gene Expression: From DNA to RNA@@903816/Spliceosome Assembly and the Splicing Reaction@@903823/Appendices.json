Under these conditions, the principle of detailed balance applies. This implies that the steady-state distribution of the system across its microstates is a thermodynamic equilibrium distribution. The probability of finding the system in any given state is proportional to its statistical weight.\n\nLet us define the statistical weight, $w$, of each state relative to the unbound state $(0,0,0)$, for which we set the weight $w_{000} = 1$.
