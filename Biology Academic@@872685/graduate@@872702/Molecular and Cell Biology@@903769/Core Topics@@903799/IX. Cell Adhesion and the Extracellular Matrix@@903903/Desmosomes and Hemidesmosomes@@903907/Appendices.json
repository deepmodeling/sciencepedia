To achieve this, we must first calculate the equilibrium concentration of the desmoplakin-keratin complex, denoted as $[DK]$.\n\nThe system is defined by three fundamental equations:\n1.  The definition of the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n    $$K_d = \\frac{[D][K]}{[DK]}$$\n2.  The conservation of total desmoplakin concentration, $D_T$:\n    $$D_T = [D] + [DK]$$\n3.  The conservation of total keratin concentration, $K_T$:\n    $$K_T = [K] + [DK]$$\n\nFrom the conservation equations, we can express the free concentrations, $[D]$ and $[K]$, in terms of the total concentrations and the complex concentration, $[DK]$.

The numerator would be $(D_T + K_T + K_d) + \\sqrt{(D_T + K_T + K_d)^2 - 4 D_T K_T}$.

We are interested in the probability density of the rupture force, $p(f)$. Using the change of variables rule for probabilities, $p(f)df = p(t)dt$, and since $f = rt$, we have $dt/df = 1/r$.

This value is comparable in magnitude to the rupture forces reported for other strong cell adhesion molecules, including the integrin-based bonds found in hemidesmosomes (e.g., $\\alpha_6\\beta_4$ integrin-laminin), which typically range from tens to over $100\\,\\mathrm{pN}$ depending on the loading rate. The result implies that the fundamental building block of desmosomal adhesion is intrinsically robust. However, the exceptional mechanical resilience of entire desmosomes and hemidesmosomes in maintaining tissue integrity arises not solely from the strength of individual bonds but crucially from their collective organization. In desmosomes, hundreds of cadherin molecules are clustered into a dense plaque, allowing for force distribution and cooperative binding (avidity), which makes the overall junction tremendously strong. Similarly, hemidesmosomes achieve their anchoring strength through the clustering of integrins and their stable linkage to the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton. Therefore, while the single-molecule strength of DSG2 is a critical determinant, the emergent, system-level properties of the complete junctional complex are what ultimately dictate the robustness of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion under dynamic physiological loads.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{61.7}\n$$", "id": "2940859"}, {"introduction": "A true understanding of a biological system lies in our ability to predict the consequences of its perturbation.

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and objective. A solution can be derived from the provided information and principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the problem is the specific molecular defect: a C-terminal truncation of desmoplakin that eliminates its ability to bind to the keratin intermediate filament network. All other components of the desmosomal plaque (N-terminal interactions, cadherin clustering) and the hemidesmosomes are stated to be intact.\n\n1.  **Effect on Keratin Network Organization**:\n    - According to Principle 1, desmosomes anchor the keratin network at cell-cell junctions. The specified mutation breaks this anchor.\n    - A cytoskeletal network that loses its peripheral anchoring points cannot maintain its extended, cell-spanning architecture. The keratin filaments, no longer tethered to the cell-cell borders, will lose tensional integrity and tend to retract from the periphery, collapsing around the nucleus. This is a well-documented phenomenon.\n    - Consequently, this leads to a \"perinuclear retraction\" of the keratin cytoskeleton and a significant \"depletion\" of keratin filaments in the perijunctional region (the area near the cell-cell border). The \"percolation\" or mechanical continuity of the keratin network across the tissue is therefore severely compromised.\n\n2.  **Effect on Stress Distribution (Load Sharing)**:\n    - According to Principle 2, tissue stress is partitioned among parallel load-bearing subsystems. In keratinocytes, these include the desmosome-keratin system, the adherens junction-actin system, and the hemidesmosome-keratin system.\n    - In wild-type cells, the desmosome-keratin network is a primary contributor to intercellular strength and stiffness, efficiently transmitting forces from cell to cell.\n    - In the mutant cells, this link is severed. Although desmosomal plaques are present, they are not connected to the main stress-bearing keratin scaffold. Their contribution to bearing intercellular tensile load becomes negligible.\n    - The applied load must be redistributed to the remaining intact structures. Intercellular forces are now borne almost exclusively by the actin-based adherens junctions. Cell-substrate forces are still handled by the intact hemidesmosomes. The load is thus \"shifted\" from the keratin system to the actin system at cell-cell junctions.\n\n3.  **Prediction of Mechanical Failure**:\n    - According to Principle 3, failure initiates at the weakest link. By disabling the strong desmosome-keratin coupling, the intercellular adherens junctions become the primary mediators of cell-cell cohesion under stretch.\n    - While adherens junctions contribute to cohesion, the integrated desmosome-keratin system is architecturally designed for superior mechanical resilience against high tensile forces. Shifting the entire intercellular load onto the adherens junctions overloads them. They become the \"weakest link\" in the context of intercellular adhesion.\n    - Therefore, when the monolayer is subjected to a $20\\%$ uniaxial stretch, failure is expected to initiate at these overloaded intercellular borders, causing cells to pull apart from each other.\n    - Because the monolayer now relies on a mechanically inferior system for cell-cell adhesion, it will be weaker than the wild-type monolayer. It will fail at a lower overall stress, and given the constant rate of stretch, this corresponds to a lower failure strain.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Loss of keratin binding at desmosomes triggers compensatory actomyosin reinforcement at adherens junctions that increases intercellular stiffness; cortical keratin density near desmosomes is unchanged, and the monolayer fails at higher strain than wild type due to improved load sharing.**\n- This option incorrectly claims cortical keratin density is unchanged, which contradicts the consequence of losing keratin anchorage. It also incorrectly claims an increase in stiffness and failure strain. While some compensation may occur, it is biologically implausible for it to overcompensate for the loss of the primary load-bearing keratin network to a degree that makes the tissue stronger.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Keratin fails to anchor at desmosomes, leading to perijunctional depletion and perinuclear retraction of keratin bundles with reduced network percolation across cell-cell borders; load shifts toward actin-based adherens junctions and cell-matrix anchorage, but intercellular borders become the limiting elements and open first under uniaxial stretch, decreasing failure strain compared to wild type.**\n- This option correctly describes the predicted collapse of the keratin network (\"perijunctional depletion and perinuclear retraction\"). It correctly identifies the load shift to adherens junctions and cell-matrix anchorage. It correctly identifies the intercellular borders as the new weakest link (\"limiting elements\") and correctly concludes that the failure strain will be decreased compared to the wild type. Each point follows logically from the givens and principles.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Because hemidesmosomes redundantly anchor keratin, detachment from desmosomes has little effect on keratin organization at cell-cell borders; the monolayer exhibits unchanged failure strain under uniaxial stretch.**\n- This option is founded on a flawed premise. Hemidesmosomes and desmosomes have distinct, non-redundant functions. Hemidesmosomes anchor the cell to the substrate (ECM), while desmosomes anchor cells to each other. Losing intercellular anchorage (at desmosomes) cannot be compensated by substrate anchorage (at hemidesmosomes) in terms of maintaining cell-cell cohesion or keratin organization at cell borders. The conclusion of unchanged failure strain is therefore also incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The truncation increases the affinity of desmoplakin for keratin, causing hyperbundling of keratin at desmosomes and a thicker perijunctional keratin ring; the augmented crosslink density raises the failure strain compared to wild type.**\n- This option directly contradicts the problem statement. The problem explicitly states that the truncation \"removes the plakin repeat domains required for intermediate filament binding,\" which means affinity is lost, not increased. The entire chain of reasoning in this option is based on a false premise.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2940886"}]}
