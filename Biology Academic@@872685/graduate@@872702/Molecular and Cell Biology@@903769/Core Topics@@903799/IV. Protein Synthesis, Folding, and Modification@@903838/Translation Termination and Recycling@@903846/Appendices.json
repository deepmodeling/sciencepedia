Assume that, under the assay conditions described below, the steady-state rate of peptide release as a function of eRF1 concentration obeys Michaelis–Menten kinetics with respect to eRF1. In a fully reconstituted in vitro system with ribosomes programmed with a cognate stop codon, the following steady-state kinetic parameters for eRF1 were measured by varying eRF1 concentration at saturating GTP and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA):\n\n- Condition A (eRF1 alone): $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 0.25$ s$^{-1}$ and $K_M = 2.00$ $\\mu$M.\n- Condition B (eRF1 with eRF3·GTP): $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 3.00$ s$^{-1}$ and $K_M = 0.500$ $\\mu$M.\n\nUsing only well-established enzyme kinetic principles applicable to Michaelis–Menten systems, compute the fold-change in catalytic efficiency upon addition of eRF3·GTP (Condition B relative to Condition A).

It is based on the established Michaelis–Menten model of enzyme kinetics and applies it to a well-characterized biological system, the termination of eukaryotic protein synthesis. All data required for the calculation are provided, and the terms used are standard in the field of biochemistry and molecular biology. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be presented.\n\nThe central concept required to solve this problem is catalytic efficiency, a measure of an enzyme's effectiveness at converting substrate to product. For an enzyme that follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics, the catalytic efficiency, denoted here by $\\eta$, is defined as the ratio of the turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, to the Michaelis constant, $K_M$.\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\n$$\nThis quantity represents the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction between the enzyme and its substrate at low substrate concentrations.\n\nThe problem provides kinetic parameters for the release factor eRF1 under two different conditions.\n\nFor Condition A (eRF1 alone), the parameters are:\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cat, A}} = 0.25 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n- $K_{\\mathrm{M, A}} = 2.00 \\text{ }\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe catalytic efficiency for Condition A is therefore:\n$$\n\\eta_A = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat, A}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M, A}}} = \\frac{0.25 \\mathrm{ s}^{-1}}{2.00 \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 0.125 \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFor Condition B (eRF1 with eRF3·GTP), the parameters are:\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cat, B}} = 3.00 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n- $K_{\\mathrm{M, B}} = 0.500 \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe catalytic efficiency for Condition B is:\n$$\n\\eta_B = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat, B}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M, B}}} = \\frac{3.00 \\mathrm{ s}^{-1}}{0.500 \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 6.00 \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in catalytic efficiency upon addition of eRF3·GTP, which is the ratio of the efficiency in Condition B to that in Condition A.\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\eta_B}{\\eta_A} = \\frac{6.00 \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.125 \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\n$$\nCalculating this ratio gives:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = 48.0\n$$\nThe problem also requires a mechanistic inference based on the numerical values. To do this, we must examine the individual contributions of $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and $K_M$ to the overall change in efficiency. The total fold-change can be dissected as follows:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta_B}{\\eta_A} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat, B}}/K_{\\mathrm{M, B}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat, A}}/K_{\\mathrm{M, A}}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat, B}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat, A}}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{M, A}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M, B}}}\\right)\n$$\nLet us compute the fold-change for each parameter.\nThe fold-change in the turnover number ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) is:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat, B}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat, A}}} = \\frac{3.00 \\mathrm{ s}^{-1}}{0.25 \\mathrm{ s}^{-1}} = 12\n$$\nThis $12$-fold increase in $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ signifies that eRF3·GTP substantially accelerates the catalytic step of peptide hydrolysis once the eRF1-ribosome complex is formed.\nThe fold-change in the Michaelis constant ($K_M$) is:\n$$\n\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{M, B}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M, A}}} = \\frac{0.500 \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{2.00 \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 0.25\n$$\nThis represents a $4$-fold decrease in $K_M$. In the Michaelis–Menten model, $K_M$ reflects the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half-maximal. A decrease in $K_M$ indicates an increase in the apparent affinity of eRF1 for the ribosomal complex. Thus, eRF3·GTP enhances the binding or recognition of the stop codon complex by eRF1.\n\nThe overall fold-change in catalytic efficiency ($48$) is the product of the enhancement from the increased catalytic rate (a factor of $12$) and the enhancement from the increased apparent affinity (a factor of $4$, since efficiency is inversely proportional to $K_M$).\n$$\n12 \\times 4 = 48\n$$\nMechanistically, eRF3·GTP acts as a potent activator by improving *both* the binding of eRF1 to the ribosome (reflected in the lower $K_M$) and the rate of the chemical reaction it catalyzes (reflected in the higher $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$). Both factors contribute significantly to the large increase in catalytic efficiency.\n\nThe final answer requested is the fold-change in catalytic efficiency, rounded to three significant figures.

Your task is to infer, from first principles of translational GTPase regulation and peptidyl transferase chemistry, the most likely order of molecular events that leads to insertion of the eRF1 glycine-glycine-glutamine (GGQ) loop into the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Use only widely accepted base facts: the ribosome decodes stop codons in the aminoacyl site, translational GTPases undergo guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis to enable accommodation-like rearrangements, eRF1 recognizes stop codons via its N domain and catalyzes ester hydrolysis via its M-domain GGQ when that loop is placed in the PTC, and eRF3 is a GTPase that binds eRF1 and the GTPase-activating elements of the large subunit.\n\nThe three classes are summarized by the following imaging and biochemical features:\n\nClass $A$:\n- Density consistent with intact GTP in eRF3; ordered switch regions contacting the sarcin-ricin loop and factor-binding elements of the large subunit.\n- eRF1 N domain’s conserved NIKS motif engages the stop codon in the decoding center; the M-domain GGQ loop is displaced from the PTC by approximately $15\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n- eRF1 C domain makes contacts with eRF3 that appear to restrain the eRF1 M domain.\n- The small subunit head adopts a decoding-like conformation; no density for peptide release factors other than eRF1/eRF3 is observed.\n\nClass $B$:\n- eRF3 remains bound with GTP-like density present; the switch regions remain ordered and engaged with the GTPase-activating center.\n- eRF1 N domain continues to base-read the stop codon; the M-domain GGQ loop approaches the PTC to within approximately $8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ but does not occupy the catalytic site; contacts between eRF1 C domain and eRF3 persist.\n- The peptidyl transferase center remains unoccupied by GGQ; no clear catalytic water is observed.\n\nClass $C$:\n- No density for eRF3 is detected at the factor-binding site; no gamma-phosphate density is present anywhere consistent with eRF3 GTP hydrolysis having occurred and the factor having dissociated.\n- eRF1 adopts an extended conformation; the M-domain GGQ loop now sits in the PTC within approximately $3\\,\\text{\\AA}$ of the scissile ester of the peptidyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), with density consistent with a bound catalytic water molecule.\n- The eRF1 N domain continues to engage the stop codon in the decoding center.\n\nAdditional constraints:\n- In the presence of a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, only Class $A$ is observed under otherwise identical conditions.\n- With a GTPase-deficient variant of eRF3, Classes $A$ and $B$ accumulate, whereas Class $C$ is not detected.\n\nBased on these data and the fundamental principles stated above, which sequence best represents the order of events leading to GGQ loop insertion into the PTC?\n\nA. eRF1 N-domain stop-codon recognition, followed by partial eRF1 accommodation toward the PTC, then GGQ insertion into the PTC while eRF3-GTP remains bound; eRF3 hydrolysis and dissociation occur after GGQ insertion.\n\nB. eRF1 N-domain stop-codon recognition, followed by eRF3 GTP hydrolysis, eRF3 dissociation, and subsequent eRF1 accommodation culminating in GGQ insertion into the PTC.\n\nC. eRF3 GTP hydrolysis occurs before stop-codon recognition; hydrolysis triggers eRF1 N-domain engagement with the codon and then GGQ insertion.\n\nD.

Recruitment of adenosine triphosphatases associated with diverse cellular activities 1 (ABCE1) to the ribosome precedes eRF3 GTP hydrolysis and is required to drive GGQ insertion while eRF3 remains bound.", "solution": "The problem requires deducing the temporal order of molecular events during eukaryotic translation termination from a set of static cryo-electron microscopy structures and biochemical constraints. The process begins with the binding of the eRF1-eRF3-GTP complex to a ribosome displaying a stop codon in the A-site and ends with the insertion of the eRF1 GGQ motif into the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) to catalyze peptide release.\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **System:** Eukaryotic pre-termination complex.\n- **Components:** Ribosome with a stop codon in the A-site, eukaryotic Release Factor 1 (eRF1), eukaryotic Release Factor 3 (eRF3) bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP).\n- **Core Principles:**\n    1. The ribosome decodes stop codons in the A-site.\n    2.

With a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, only Class A is observed.\n    2. With a GTPase-deficient eRF3 mutant, Classes A and B accumulate, but Class C is not observed.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. The described components, interactions, and mechanisms (e.g., role of GTP hydrolysis, function of eRF1/eRF3, structure of the termination complex) are consistent with established principles of molecular and cell biology. The experimental design, using cryo-EM snapshots combined with biochemical constraints from GTP analogs and mutants, is a standard and powerful approach in structural biology to infer dynamic mechanisms. The data are self-consistent and sufficient to deduce a logical sequence of events. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Molecular Pathway**\n\nThe objective is to order the three structural classes (A, B, C) into a chronological sequence based on the provided data and fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Identification of the Initial State:** The first constraint states that in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, the system is trapped exclusively in **Class A**. Non-hydrolyzable analogs lock GTPases in their \"on\" state, preventing progression through their functional cycle. This unambiguously identifies Class A as the initial, pre-hydrolysis state, representing the successful recognition of the stop codon by the eRF1-eRF3-GTP complex. The pathway must start with the events described in Class A.\n\n2.  **The Role of GTP Hydrolysis:** The second constraint states that a GTPase-deficient eRF3 mutant prevents the formation of **Class C**, while allowing for the accumulation of **Classes A and B**. This is a critical piece of information. It demonstrates that the transition to Class C is strictly dependent on the chemical step of GTP hydrolysis. Since the mutant can bind GTP but not hydrolyze it, the pathway is blocked just before the hydrolysis-dependent step.\n\n3.  **Ordering the Intermediates:** Since the GTPase-deficient mutant accumulates both A and B, it implies that the transition from A to B does not require GTP hydrolysis. Class B, where the GGQ motif has moved closer to the PTC, represents a conformational intermediate state that is accessible pre-hydrolysis. The pathway thus proceeds from A to B. This transition from A ($\\approx 15\\,\\text{\\AA}$ displacement) to B ($\\approx 8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ displacement) represents a partial accommodation of eRF1 that occurs while eRF3-GTP is still bound.\n\n4.  **The Final Step:** Class C is characterized by two key features that occur concurrently: the absence of eRF3 and the full insertion of the eRF1 GGQ loop into the PTC. The constraint on the GTPase-deficient mutant proves that GTP hydrolysis is the necessary trigger for reaching Class C. The generally accepted model for translational GTPases, including eRF3, is that GTP hydrolysis to GDP causes a conformational change that dramatically lowers the factor's affinity for the ribosome and its binding partners, leading to its dissociation. The description of Class A mentions that eRF3 restrains eRF1. Therefore, the sequence of events is: GTP hydrolysis triggers the dissociation of eRF3, which in turn releases the M-domain of eRF1, allowing it to undergo a final, large-scale accommodation to insert the GGQ motif into the PTC.\n\n**Summary of the Deduced Pathway:**\n1.  **State A:** eRF1-eRF3-GTP binds the ribosome and the eRF1 N-domain recognizes the stop codon.\n2.  **State B:** The complex undergoes partial accommodation, bringing the GGQ loop closer to the PTC, but GTP is not yet hydrolyzed.\n3.  **GTP Hydrolysis:** eRF3 hydrolyzes GTP, triggered by interaction with the ribosome's GTPase-activating center.\n4.  **eRF3 Dissociation:** Following hydrolysis, eRF3-GDP dissociates from eRF1 and the ribosome.\n5.  **State C:** Released from the restraint of eRF3, eRF1 fully accommodates, inserting its GGQ loop into the PTC to prime for catalysis.\n\nThe sequence of key events is: Codon Recognition $\\rightarrow$ (Partial Accommodation) $\\rightarrow$ GTP Hydrolysis $\\rightarrow$ eRF3 Dissociation $\\rightarrow$ Full Accommodation/GGQ Insertion.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. eRF1 N-domain stop-codon recognition, followed by partial eRF1 accommodation toward the PTC, then GGQ insertion into the PTC while eRF3-GTP remains bound; eRF3 hydrolysis and dissociation occur after GGQ insertion.**\n    This option correctly identifies the initial recognition and partial accommodation. However, it incorrectly states that full GGQ insertion (Class C) occurs *while eRF3-GTP remains bound*. This contradicts the data from the GTPase-deficient mutant, which shows that GGQ insertion (formation of Class C) requires GTP hydrolysis. It also reverses the cause and effect; hydrolysis enables insertion, not the other way around.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. eRF1 N-domain stop-codon recognition, followed by eRF3 GTP hydrolysis, eRF3 dissociation, and subsequent eRF1 accommodation culminating in GGQ insertion into the PTC.**\n    This option lays out the major causal checkpoints in the correct order. It starts with stop-codon recognition (Class A and B are pre-hydrolysis recognition states). It then correctly places GTP hydrolysis and the resulting eRF3 dissociation as the events that *precede* and *enable* the final accommodation of eRF1 and GGQ insertion (Class C). While it simplifies the process by not explicitly detailing the A $\\rightarrow$ B partial accommodation, it correctly captures the essential sequence of irreversible events.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. eRF3 GTP hydrolysis occurs before stop-codon recognition; hydrolysis triggers eRF1 N-domain engagement with the codon and then GGQ insertion.**\n    This is incorrect. GTP hydrolysis is a proofreading step that occurs *after* the initial recognition of the correct substrate (in this case, a stop codon). Class A clearly shows stop codon recognition occurs with intact GTP. Hydrolysis before recognition would be a futile cycle.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. GGQ insertion into the PTC precedes both stop-codon recognition and any eRF3 GTPase activity; subsequent recognition and hydrolysis act only as fidelity checkpoints after catalysis has been primed.**\n    This reverses the entire process. The data show that GGQ insertion is the final step, dependent on prior recognition and hydrolysis. Class A shows recognition occurs when the GGQ is $\\approx 15\\,\\text{\\AA}$ away from the PTC.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Recruitment of adenosine triphosphatases associated with diverse cellular activities 1 (ABCE1) to the ribosome precedes eRF3 GTP hydrolysis and is required to drive GGQ insertion while eRF3 remains bound.**\n    This statement is directly contradicted by the problem's given data: \"no density for peptide release factors other than eRF1/eRF3 is observed.\" Therefore, a mechanism involving ABCE1 at this stage is inconsistent with the provided experimental observations.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of the provided structural and biochemical data, Option B provides the most accurate description of the sequence of events leading to the insertion of the eRF1 GGQ loop into the peptidyl transferase center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2967332"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a molecular mechanism is powerful, but its ultimate test lies in predicting how perturbations affect the entire system.
