The derivation will be built upon the three principles stipulated: the law of mass action, the Michaelis–Menten rate law, and the definition of velocity as expected displacement per unit time.\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the enzyme-nucleosome complex, $[EN]$, at equilibrium. The binding reaction is $E + N \\rightleftharpoons EN$. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[E][N]}{[EN]}$$\nHere, $[E]$ and $[N]$ are the free concentrations of the enzyme and nucleosome, respectively.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of transition-state theory and statistical mechanics as applied to molecular motors, a standard and well-understood topic in biophysics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary physical constants, data, and constraints to derive a model and perform a numerical fit for the unknown parameters. The definitions and assumptions are explicit and self-consistent. We therefore proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we must derive the relationship between the translocation velocity $v(F)$ and the opposing force $F$. The foundation of this derivation is transition-state theory, which posits that the rate of a chemical reaction is limited by the height of an activation free energy barrier, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$. The rate constant, $k$, for crossing this barrier is given by the Arrhenius-Eyring equation:\n\n$$ k = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\n\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $h$ is the Planck constant. For our purposes, we can absorb the pre-exponential factor into a single constant, $A$, as the precise attempt frequency is not of interest.\n\n$$ k \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\n\nThe velocity of the motor, $v$, is directly proportional to the rate of the rate-limiting catalytic step. The problem states that the chemical-mechanical step size is absorbed into an effective velocity parameter, so we can write the velocity as being directly proportional to the rate constant $k$:\n\n$$ v \\propto k $$\n\nThus, the velocity is a function of the activation energy:\n\n$$ v = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\n\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nNext, we incorporate the effect of the external resisting force, $F$. According to assumption (ii), the force couples linearly to the reaction coordinate. This means that as the enzyme progresses from its ground state to the transition state over a projected distance $d$ along the direction of the force, it must perform work against this force. The work done, $W$, is $Fd$. The problem's sign convention dictates that this resisting force decreases the forward rate, which physically means the force increases the height of the activation barrier. Therefore, the new force-dependent activation energy, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger(F)$, is the sum of the intrinsic zero-force barrier, $\\Delta G_0^\\ddagger$, and the work done against the force:\n\n$$ \\Delta G^\\ddagger(F) = \\Delta G_0^\\ddagger + Fd $$\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation for velocity gives the force-dependent velocity, $v(F)$:\n\n$$ v(F) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_0^\\ddagger + Fd}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\n\nBy the properties of exponents, this can be rewritten as:\n\n$$ v(F) = \\left(C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_0^\\ddagger}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Fd}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\n\nWe recognize the term in parentheses as the velocity in the absence of any opposing force ($F=0$).

To estimate the parameters $v_0$ and $d$ for each test case, we must perform a nonlinear least-squares regression. This involves finding the values of $v_0$ and $d$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the measured velocities, $v_i^{\\text{meas}}$, and the velocities predicted by the model at the corresponding forces, $F_i$:\n\n$$ \\text{SSR}(v_0, d) = \\sum_i \\left( v_i^{\\text{meas}} - v_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F_i d}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) \\right)^2 $$\n\nFor numerical implementation, we must use a consistent set of units. The force $F$ is in piconewtons (pN), and the distance $d$ is sought in nanometers (nm). The energy unit is therefore pN$\\cdot$nm. We are given the Boltzmann constant as $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$ and the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{pN}\\cdot\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J}$. We must convert $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ to units of $\\mathrm{pN}\\cdot\\mathrm{nm/K}$:\n\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{K}} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{pN}\\cdot\\mathrm{nm}}{10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{pN}\\cdot\\mathrm{nm}}{\\mathrm{K}} $$\n\nThe term $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ in the exponent thus has units of pN$\\cdot$nm, and the argument of the exponential, $-\\frac{Fd}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}$, is correctly dimensionless. The problem requires that $d$ be constrained to be non-negative, which is a physically necessary condition. The velocity $v_0$ must also be non-negative. These constraints will be applied during the numerical optimization procedure for each of the three test cases. The final fitted parameters will be reported to three decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and applies a mechanochemical model to fit force-velocity data\n    for an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define physical constants and conversion factors.\n    K_B_J_PER_K = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    J_PER_PN_NM = 1e-21          # Conversion from J to pN*nm\n    K_B_PN_NM_PER_K = K_B_J_PER_K / J_PER_PN_NM\n\n    # Test cases: (Temperature, Forces, Measured Velocities)\n    test_cases = [\n        (\n            298,\n            np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]),\n            np.array([12.000, 8.964, 6.696, 4.992, 3.744, 2.796])\n        ),\n        (\n            310,\n            np.array([0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0]),\n            np.array([15.000, 9.840, 6.466, 4.260, 2.794])\n        ),\n        (\n            293,\n            np.array([0.0, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0]),\n            np.array([8.000, 6.403, 4.101, 2.104, 1.080])\n        )\n    ]\n\n    # The model function v(F) = v0 * exp(-F*d / (k_B*T))\n    def velocity_model(F, v0, d, kBT_pnnm):\n        \"\"\"\n        Force-velocity model based on transition-state theory.\n        Args:\n            F (float or np.ndarray): Opposing force in pN.\n            v0 (float): Zero-load velocity in bp/s.\n            d (float): Distance to transition state in nm.\n            kBT_pnnm (float): Thermal energy in pN*nm.\n        Returns:\n            float or np.ndarray: Predicted velocity in bp/s.\n        \"\"\"\n        return v0 * np.exp(-F * d / kBT_pnnm)\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for T, F_data, v_data in test_cases:\n        # Calculate thermal energy for the current temperature\n        kBT_pnnm = K_B_PN_NM_PER_K * T\n\n        # Create a model function with a signature compatible with curve_fit\n        # This lambda function \"closes over\" the kBT_pnnm value for the current case.\n        fit_function = lambda F, v0, d: velocity_model(F, v0, d, kBT_pnnm)\n\n        # Set bounds for parameters: v0 >= 0, d >= 0\n        bounds = ([0, 0], [np.inf, np.inf])\n        \n        # Provide an initial guess for the parameters [v0, d]\n        # v0 is typically close to the velocity at zero force.\n        # d is a distance on the order of nanometers.\n        initial_guess = [v_data[0], 1.0]\n\n        # Perform the nonlinear least-squares fit\n        popt, _ = curve_fit(\n            fit_function,\n            F_data,\n            v_data,\n            p0=initial_guess,\n            bounds=bounds\n        )\n\n        v0_fit, d_fit = popt\n        results.extend([v0_fit, d_fit])\n\n    # Format the results to three decimal places and create the output string\n    formatted_results = [f\"{val:.3f}\" for val in results]\n    output_string = f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\"\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(output_string)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2933235"}]}
