By predicting the phenotypes of various genetic combinations, you will solidify your grasp of concepts like dominance and epistasis, which are essential for dissecting any regulatory pathway.", "problem": "A core model for gene regulation in bacteria combines the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is translated to protein) with the concepts of cis-acting DNA sequences and trans-acting regulatory proteins. In the lactose (lac) system of Escherichia coli (E. coli), transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) from the lac promoter is negatively regulated by the Lac repressor protein, which is encoded by the lacI gene. The repressor binds specific operator DNA sequences adjacent to the promoter, sterically and energetically antagonizing RNAP binding and productive initiation. Allosteric binding of an inducer such as allolactose or the gratuitous inducer isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) shifts the conformational equilibrium of the repressor toward a state with reduced affinity for operator DNA, thereby permitting transcription.\n\nMutations can alter either the trans-acting repressor or the cis-acting operator. For example, repressor variants can change their inducer responsiveness without abolishing DNA binding, and operator variants can reduce repressor binding affinity without changing the protein. Because the repressor protein diffuses, repressor alleles exhibit dominance in trans across operon copies within the same cell, whereas operator alleles affect only the linked operon in cis.\n\nConsider the following genotypes and environmental conditions, each evaluated for expression of the lacZ structural gene (β-galactosidase) as the readout of lac operon transcription:\n\n- Haploid strain A: $lacI^s\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$.\n- Haploid strain B: $lacI^+\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$.\n- Haploid strain C: $lacI^s\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$.\n- Merodiploid strain D (partial diploid carrying an $F'$ episome with a second lac region): chromosomal copy $lacI^s\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$; episomal copy $lacI^+\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$; the cell has a single cytoplasm in which repressor proteins can diffuse.\n\nEach strain is tested in the absence of inducer and in the presence of saturating IPTG. Assume that $lacI^s$ repressor, if bound to an operator, will not dissociate in response to IPTG, and that $lacO^c$ operator, if mutated, cannot be bound by any repressor variant. Assume also that transcription from $lacO^+$ requires relief of repression by repressor dissociation and that $lacO^c$ does not alter RNAP’s intrinsic ability to initiate when unimpeded by repressor.\n\nWhich option correctly defines and distinguishes the $lacI^s$ (superrepressor) and $lacO^c$ (operator constitutive) alleles, and correctly states their epistatic relationship for lac expression in the presence and absence of inducer across the strains above?\n\nA. $lacI^s$ encodes a repressor that cannot bind operator DNA, making it recessive; $lacO^c$ encodes a diffusible activator that acts in trans. Therefore, strain A is inducible by IPTG, strain B is inducible only in the presence of IPTG, strain C is off without IPTG and on with IPTG, and in strain D both copies are off without IPTG but both become on with IPTG. $lacI^s$ is epistatic to $lacO^c$ because repressors dominate over operators.\n\nB. $lacI^s$ encodes a repressor that binds operator DNA but cannot bind inducer, making it dominant in trans over $lacI^+$; $lacO^c$ is a cis-acting operator allele that reduces or abolishes repressor binding to the linked operon. Therefore, strain A is off without IPTG and remains off with IPTG (uninducible), strain B is on without IPTG and remains on with IPTG (constitutive), strain C is on without IPTG and remains on with IPTG (constitutive), and in strain D the $lacO^c$-linked $lacZ^+$ is on in both conditions while the $lacO^+$-linked $lacZ^+$ is off in both conditions; for the linked operon, $lacO^c$ is epistatic to $lacI^s$ in both absence and presence of inducer.\n\nC. $lacI^s$ encodes a repressor that binds inducer too tightly and thus dissociates from operator even without IPTG; $lacO^c$ strengthens repressor binding and acts only in cis. Therefore, strain A is on without IPTG and off with IPTG, strain B is off in both conditions, strain C is off without IPTG and off with IPTG, and in strain D both copies are off regardless of IPTG. $lacO^c$ is recessive to $lacI^s$ because operator sequences do not determine expression.\n\nD. $lacI^s$ encodes a repressor that cannot bind inducer and remains operator-bound; $lacO^c$ is cis-acting and prevents repressor binding to its operator. However, high concentrations of IPTG titrate $lacI^s$ away. Therefore, strain A is off without IPTG but on with IPTG, strain B is on without IPTG and remains on with IPTG, strain C is off without IPTG but on with IPTG, and in strain D both copies are off without IPTG but both become on with IPTG. $lacI^s$ is epistatic to $lacO^c$ in the absence of IPTG, but IPTG reverses this epistasis.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n- **System**: Bacterial gene regulation, specifically the lactose (*lac*) operon of *Escherichia coli*.\n- **Core Principle**: DNA $\\rightarrow$ mRNA $\\rightarrow$ Protein.

The alleles described ($lacI^s$, $lacO^c$) are classic mutations used to elucidate this model. The problem is well-posed; it provides a set of genotypes and explicit, non-contradictory assumptions about allele function. The question is objective and requires a logical deduction of phenotypes and genetic interactions based on the provided framework. No scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions are present in the problem setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Phenotypes and Genetic Relationships**\n\nWe will analyze the expression of the $lacZ^+$ gene for each strain in the absence ($-$IPTG) and presence ($+$IPTG) of the inducer. Expression is \"on\" if transcription occurs and \"off\" if it is blocked.\n\n1.  **Strain A: $lacI^s\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$**\n    - The cell produces the superrepressor protein ($lacI^s$), which binds to the wild-type operator ($lacO^+$).\n    - **Condition ($-$IPTG)**: The $lacI^s$ repressor binds to $lacO^+$, blocking RNAP. Transcription is **off**.\n    - **Condition ($+$IPTG)**: The $lacI^s$ repressor cannot bind IPTG and remains bound to $lacO^+$. Transcription remains **off**.\n    - **Phenotype**: Uninducible (always off).\n\n2.  **Strain B: $lacI^+\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$**\n    - The cell produces wild-type repressor ($lacI^+$).\n    - The operator is constitutive ($lacO^c$), meaning it cannot be bound by any repressor.\n    - **Condition ($-$IPTG)**: Although active $lacI^+$ repressor is present, it cannot bind to the $lacO^c$ operator. RNAP is not blocked. Transcription is **on**.\n    - **Condition ($+$IPTG)**: The presence of inducer is irrelevant as the operator is already unable to bind repressor. Transcription remains **on**.\n    - **Phenotype**: Constitutive (always on).\n\n3.  **Strain C: $lacI^s\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$**\n    - The cell produces superrepressor ($lacI^s$).\n    - The operator is constitutive ($lacO^c$) and cannot be bound by the $lacI^s$ repressor.\n    - **Condition ($-$IPTG)**: The $lacI^s$ repressor cannot bind to the $lacO^c$ operator. RNAP is not blocked. Transcription is **on**.\n    - **Condition ($+$IPTG)**: The situation is unchanged. Repressor cannot bind the operator. Transcription remains **on**.\n    - **Phenotype**: Constitutive (always on).\n    - **Epistasis**: This strain contains an allele for an \"always off\" phenotype ($lacI^s$) and an allele for an \"always on\" phenotype ($lacO^c$). The resulting phenotype is \"always on.\" This demonstrates that the $lacO^c$ mutation is epistatic to the $lacI^s$ mutation because the operator mutation prevents the repressor protein from exerting its effect on the linked operon. This is a classic example where a *cis*-acting element's function dictates the outcome over a *trans*-acting factor.\n\n4.  **Strain D: Merodiploid $lacI^s\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+ / F' lacI^+\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$**\n    - This cell contains two sets of *lac* genes and produces two types of repressor proteins: $lacI^s$ (superrepressor) and $lacI^+$ (wild-type). Both proteins are diffusible (*trans*-acting). We analyze each operon separately.\n    - **Chromosomal operon ($lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$)**: This operon has a wild-type operator, $lacO^+$. In the cytoplasm, both $lacI^s$ and $lacI^+$ repressors are present. The $lacI^s$ protein is dominant over $lacI^+$ because it will remain bound to $lacO^+$ even if IPTG causes $lacI^+$ to dissociate. Therefore, the $lacO^+$ operator will always be occupied by the $lacI^s$ protein. Transcription is **off** under both ($-$IPTG) and ($+$IPTG) conditions.\n    - **Episomal operon ($lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$)**: This operon has a constitutive operator, $lacO^c$. By definition, this operator cannot be bound by *either* the $lacI^s$ or the $lacI^+$ repressor. Thus, RNAP is never blocked from this operon. Transcription is **on** under both ($-$IPTG) and ($+$IPTG) conditions.\n    - **Overall Phenotype**: Expression is measured for the entire cell. The chromosomal $lacZ^+$ is always off. The episomal $lacZ^+$ is always on. The cell will therefore produce $\\beta$-galactosidase constitutively from the episomal copy.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **Option A**: States that $lacI^s$ cannot bind operator DNA and that $lacO^c$ encodes a diffusible activator. Both statements are fundamentally incorrect. The descriptions of $lacI^s$ and $lacO^c$ are wrong. The resulting phenotype predictions are consequently incorrect. For example, it predicts strain A is inducible, whereas it is uninducible. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option B**:\n    - Defines $lacI^s$ as a repressor that binds the operator but not the inducer, making it dominant in *trans*. **Correct**.\n    - Defines $lacO^c$ as a *cis*-acting operator that abolishes repressor binding. **Correct**.\n    - Predicts strain A is off/off (uninducible). **Correct**.\n    - Predicts strain B is on/on (constitutive). **Correct**.\n    - Predicts strain C is on/on (constitutive). **Correct**.\n    - Predicts that in strain D, the $lacO^c$-linked gene is on/on while the $lacO^+$-linked gene is off/off. **Correct**.\n    - States that for the linked operon, $lacO^c$ is epistatic to $lacI^s$. As demonstrated in the analysis of Strain C, this is **Correct**.\n    - All parts of this option are consistent with the principles of molecular biology and the logical deductions from the problem statement. **Correct**.\n\n-   **Option C**: States that $lacI^s$ binds inducer too tightly and that $lacO^c$ strengthens repressor binding. Both definitions are the opposite of the correct functions and contradict the problem statement's assumptions. The phenotype predictions are therefore invalid. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option D**: Correctly defines the basic functions of $lacI^s$ and $lacO^c$. However, it introduces a new assumption that \"high concentrations of IPTG titrate $lacI^s$ away.\" This directly contradicts the explicit premise of the problem: \"$lacI^s$ repressor, if bound to an operator, will not dissociate in response to IPTG.\" The subsequent predictions, such as strain A being inducible by IPTG, are based on this false premise and are therefore incorrect according to the rules of the problem. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2934108"}, {"introduction": "While genetic analysis reveals the components and logic of a circuit, quantitative modeling provides a deeper, predictive understanding of its behavior.

This substitution results in a less negative (i.e., higher) $\\Delta G$ for the mutant antiterminator, indicating that it is thermodynamically destabilized relative to the wild-type structure. The attenuation switch relies on the efficient and rapid formation of the $2$–$3$ antiterminator upon ribosome stalling. A destabilized antiterminator forms less favorably, shifting the kinetic equilibrium. This increases the probability that region $3$ will remain single-stranded long enough for region $4$ to be transcribed and to form the competing, thermodynamically stable $3$–$4$ terminator hairpin. The formation of this terminator hairpin, even under low-tryptophan conditions, causes premature transcription termination. Thus, by weakening the antiterminator hairpin, the synonymous mutations disrupt the attenuation mechanism, leading to aberrant repression of the *trp* operon.\n\nTo quantify this effect, we compute the change in antiterminator stability, $\\Delta\\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{wt}}$. The Gibbs free energy of hairpin formation is calculated using the provided additive model:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\left( \\sum_{\\text{pairs}} \\Delta G_{\\text{pair}} \\right) + \\Delta G_{\\text{loop}} $$\nThe given contributions at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ are $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{G-C}} = -3.4\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{A-U}} = -2.1\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{G-U}} = -0.9\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and $\\Delta G_{\\text{loop}} = +5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ for a $5$-nucleotide loop.\n\nFor the wild-type ($wt$) hairpin with $3$ $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$ pairs, $2$ $\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$ pairs, and $1$ $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$ pair:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{wt}} = [3(-3.4) + 2(-2.1) + 1(-0.9)]\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} + 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{wt}} = [-10.2 - 4.2 - 0.9]\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} + 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{wt}} = -15.3\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} + 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = -10.3\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n\nFor the mutant ($mut$) hairpin with $1$ $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$ pair, $2$ $\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$ pairs, and $3$ $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$ pairs:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} = [1(-3.4) + 2(-2.1) + 3(-0.9)]\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} + 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} = [-3.4 - 4.2 - 2.7]\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} + 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} = -10.3\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} + 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = -5.3\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n\nThe change in stability, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, is the difference between these values:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{wt}} = (-5.3\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) - (-10.3\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\nThis calculation can be verified by considering only the changed pairs: a substitution of two $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$ pairs for two $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$ pairs.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = [2 \\times (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{G-U}})] - [2 \\times (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{G-C}})] = 2(-0.9) - 2(-3.4) = -1.8 + 6.8 = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\nThe positive value of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ confirms that the mutant antiterminator is destabilized.
