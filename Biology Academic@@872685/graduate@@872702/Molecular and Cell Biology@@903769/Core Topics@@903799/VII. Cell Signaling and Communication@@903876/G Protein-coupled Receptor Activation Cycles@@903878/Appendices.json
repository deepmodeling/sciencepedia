It is free from any of the specified invalidating flaws.\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will address the two components of GDP exchange: the basal rate and the agonist-stimulated rate.\n\n**1. Basal GDP Exchange Rate**\nThe basal, or receptor-independent, GDP exchange occurs spontaneously. The problem states that this process is characterized by a first-order rate constant $k_0$. The rate of basal exchange, $v_{basal}$, is therefore:\n$$v_{basal} = k_0 [\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]$$\nIn the absence of an agonist-activated receptor ($R^\\ast$), no complex is formed, so $[\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}] = G_T$, the total G protein concentration.\n$$v_{basal} = k_0 G_T$$\nThe problem explicitly states that the mutation does not alter $k_0$ or the intrinsic nucleotide-binding properties of G$\\alpha$. Consequently, the basal exchange rate for the mutant G protein, $v'_{basal}$, is:\n$$v'_{basal} = k_0 G_T = v_{basal}$$\nThe basal exchange rate remains unchanged.\n\n**2. Agonist-Stimulated GDP Exchange Rate**\nThe agonist-stimulated pathway proceeds via the given two-step mechanism. The overall rate of GDP release, $v_{stim}$, is determined by the rate of the catalytic step:\n$$v_{stim} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}} [R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]$$\nTo find the concentration of the complex, $[R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]$, we use the rapid pre-equilibrium assumption. The relevant species are governed by the conservation equations:\n$$R_T = [R^\\ast] + [R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]$$\n$$G_T = [\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}] + [R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]$$\nThe problem states that the experiment is conducted with fixed total concentrations $R_T$ and $G_T$. The concentration of the complex is given by the equilibrium expression:\n$$[R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}] = \\frac{[R^\\ast][\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]}{K_d}$$\nThis system is analogous to enzyme-substrate binding. A common and useful simplification is to assume that one component is in excess. Typically, G proteins are more abundant than receptors in a cell, so it is reasonable to assume $G_T > R_T$, which implies that the concentration of free G protein is not significantly depleted by receptor binding, i.e., $[\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}] \\approx G_T$. Under this condition, the fraction of receptors bound to G protein is:\n$$\\frac{[R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]}{R_T} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]} \\approx \\frac{G_T}{K_d + G_T}$$\nThus, the concentration of the complex is:\n$$[R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}] \\approx R_T \\frac{G_T}{K_d + G_T}$$\nSubstituting this into the rate equation gives:\n$$v_{stim} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{ex}} R_T \\frac{G_T}{K_d + G_T}$$\nThe mutation increases the dissociation constant from $K_d$ to $K_d' = r K_d$, with $r > 1$. The new stimulated rate, $v'_{stim}$, will be:\n$$v'_{stim} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{ex}} R_T \\frac{G_T}{K_d' + G_T} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}} R_T \\frac{G_T}{r K_d + G_T}$$\nSince $r > 1$, the denominator $(r K_d + G_T)$ is greater than $(K_d + G_T)$. Therefore, $v'_{stim} < v_{stim}$. The agonist-stimulated initial exchange rate decreases.\n\nThe \"common pre-equilibrium limit\" mentioned in option A refers to the condition where the concentration of the free \"substrate\" (here, the G protein) is much less than the dissociation constant, i.e., $G_T \\ll K_d$. In this limit:\n$$v_{stim} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{ex}} R_T \\frac{G_T}{K_d} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ex}}}{K_d}\\right) R_T G_T$$\nThe new rate under this limit is:\n$$v'_{stim} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{ex}} R_T \\frac{G_T}{K_d'} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}} R_T \\frac{G_T}{r K_d} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( k_{\\mathrm{ex}} R_T \\frac{G_T}{K_d} \\right) = \\frac{1}{r} v_{stim}$$\nIn this limit, the rate decreases by a factor of $r$, which is inversely proportional to the fold increase in $K_d$ (or directly proportional to the fold decrease in affinity).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The agonist-stimulated initial exchange rate decreases approximately in proportion to the fold-decrease in receptor–G protein affinity (i.e., scales as $1/r$ in the common pre-equilibrium limit), whereas the basal exchange rate (in the absence of agonist) remains essentially unchanged.**\nOur derivation shows that the basal rate, $v_{basal} = k_0 G_T$, is unchanged because $k_0$ is unchanged. Our derivation also shows that the stimulated rate, $v_{stim}$, decreases because the concentration of the catalytically competent complex $[R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]$ is reduced due to the increased $K_d$. The statement that the rate scales as $1/r$ is rigorously true in the pre-equilibrium limit ($G_T \\ll K_d$). This option accurately captures both effects.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The agonist-stimulated initial exchange rate is unchanged because the catalytic GDP-release step depends only on $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ once the complex forms, and $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is unaffected.**\nThis reasoning is flawed. The overall rate is $v_{stim} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}} [R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]$. Although $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is unchanged, the concentration of the complex, $[R^\\ast\\!:\\!\\mathrm{G}\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\!\\cdot\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{GDP}]$, is a function of $K_d$. Since the mutation increases $K_d$, it shifts the binding equilibrium away from the complex, reducing its concentration and thus decreasing the overall rate. This statement ignores the law of mass action on the pre-equilibrium step.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both basal and agonist-stimulated exchange rates increase because weakening the $\\alpha 5$ helix reduces GDP affinity, promoting spontaneous nucleotide exchange independently of the receptor.**\nThis statement makes several incorrect claims. First, it asserts that the basal rate increases, which contradicts the problem's explicit condition that the basal rate constant $k_0$ and intrinsic nucleotide-binding properties are unchanged. Second, it incorrectly equates weakening the receptor interface (on the $\\alpha 5$ helix) with reducing the G protein's own affinity for GDP. The problem clearly separates these two properties. Third, as derived, the agonist-stimulated rate decreases, not increases.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The mutation primarily causes a rightward shift in agonist potency (increased $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$) without changing the maximal agonist-stimulated exchange rate at saturation, since $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is unaltered.**\nThis statement conflates different experimental conditions. The \"maximal agonist-stimulated exchange rate at saturation\" can be interpreted as the rate at saturating concentrations of G protein ($G_T \\to \\infty$), which is $V_{max} = k_{ex} R_T$. This $V_{max}$ is indeed unchanged. However, the experiment is conducted at a *fixed* $G_T$, not a saturating one. At a fixed, non-saturating $G_T$, the measured rate *will* decrease, as shown in the derivation. Furthermore, while a rightward shift in agonist potency (increased $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$) is a predicted consequence within the ternary complex model, the experiment described is performed at saturating agonist, so a change in $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is not what is being measured. The statement misrepresents the primary measured effect under the given conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The mutation induces constitutive activation by promoting $\\mathrm{G}\\beta\\gamma$ dissociation, thereby increasing exchange independently of receptor occupancy.**\nConstitutive activation implies an increase in the basal, receptor-independent rate of exchange. This is directly contradicted by the given information that the basal rate constant $k_0$ is unchanged. The statement proposes a mechanism (promoting G$\\beta\\gamma$ dissociation) that is not supported by or deducible from the problem statement, which specifies the mutation's effect is on receptor affinity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2945903"}, {"introduction": "Cellular signaling is a dynamic equilibrium, where the activation of signaling components is constantly opposed by their deactivation.

The enzyme is the receptor with concentration $[R_{T}]$, and the substrate is the inactive Gα with concentration $[G_{inactive}]$. The maximal velocity is $V_{max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[R_{T}]$.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem is analyzed within the framework of mass-action binding and the operational model of agonism.\n\n**1. Binding Model**\nAccording to the law of mass action for a simple bimolecular interaction between an agonist ($A$) and a receptor ($R$), the fraction of occupied receptors at equilibrium, $p_A$, is given by:\n$$ p_A = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_A} $$\nwhere $[A]$ is the free agonist concentration and $K_A$ is the agonist's equilibrium dissociation constant. The total concentration of bound ligand, $B$, is proportional to the total receptor concentration, $R_T$, and the fractional occupancy:\n$$ B = B_{\\max} \\cdot p_A = B_{\\max} \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_A} $$\nThe maximal binding capacity, $B_{\\max}$, is a direct measure of the total number of receptors, so $B_{\\max} \\propto R_T$. The concentration of agonist required for half-maximal binding is the equilibrium dissociation constant, which we can denote as $K_d = K_A$.\n\n**2. Signaling Model (Operational Model)**\nThe operational model links receptor occupancy to the functional response. The \"stimulus,\" $S$, generated by the agonist is proportional to the concentration of agonist-receptor complexes, which depends on the total receptor density $R_T$ and an efficacy parameter $\\tau$:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\tau \\cdot R_T \\cdot [A]}{[A] + K_A} $$\nThe parameter $\\tau$ represents the intrinsic ability of an agonist-bound receptor to generate a stimulus. The final response, $E$, is a function of this stimulus, typically represented by a hyperbolic relationship:\n$$ E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{S}{S + K_E} $$\nwhere $E_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible response of the system and $K_E$ is the stimulus value that produces a half-maximal response. Substituting the expression for $S$:\n$$ E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\frac{\\tau R_T [A]}{[A] + K_A}}{\\frac{\\tau R_T [A]}{[A] + K_A} + K_E} $$\nThis can be rearranged into a standard hyperbolic concentration-response form:\n$$ E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau R_T [A]}{(\\tau R_T + K_E)[A] + K_A K_E} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\frac{\\tau R_T}{\\tau R_T + K_E} [A]}{[A] + \\frac{K_A K_E}{\\tau R_T + K_E}} $$\nThe agonist concentration that produces a half-maximal response, $EC_{50}$, is given by:\n$$ EC_{50} = \\frac{K_A K_E}{\\tau R_T + K_E} $$\nThe observed maximal response for the agonist is $E'_{\\max} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau R_T}{\\tau R_T + K_E}$.\n\n**3. Analysis of Observations**\nThe problem states that the maximal response, $E_{\\max}$ (interpreted as the observed maximum $E'_{\\max}$), is unchanged. This implies that the system has significant \"receptor reserve,\" meaning the maximal stimulus $\\tau R_T$ is much larger than $K_E$. In this regime ($\\tau R_T \\gg K_E$):\n- The observed maximal response $E'_{\\max} \\approx E_{\\max}$, which is consistent with the observation.\n- The $EC_{50}$ expression simplifies to:\n$$ EC_{50} \\approx \\frac{K_A K_E}{\\tau R_T} $$\n\nNow, we analyze the perturbation. Let control parameters be $K_A$, $R_T$, $\\tau$ and perturbed parameters be $K'_A$, $R'_T$, $\\tau'$.\n- **Binding Observation**: The binding curve is shifted right by a factor $\\alpha > 1$. This means the half-maximal binding concentration has increased: $K'_d = \\alpha \\cdot K_d$. Since $K_d = K_A$, we have $K'_A = \\alpha \\cdot K_A$. The observation that $B_{\\max}$ is unchanged implies that the total receptor number is unchanged, so $R'_T = R_T$.\n- **Signaling Observation**: The response curve is shifted right by the same factor $\\alpha$. This means the $EC_{50}$ has increased by this factor: $EC'_{50} = \\alpha \\cdot EC_{50}$.\n\nWe seek a single parameter change that satisfies these conditions. Let us examine the ratio of the perturbed $EC_{50}$ to the control $EC_{50}$:\n$$ \\frac{EC'_{50}}{EC_{50}} = \\frac{K'_A / (\\tau' R'_T)}{K_A / (\\tau R_T)} = \\left(\\frac{K'_A}{K_A}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau'}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R_T}{R'_T}\\right) $$\nFrom the observations, we know:\n$$ \\frac{EC'_{50}}{EC_{50}} \\approx \\alpha $$\n$$ \\frac{K'_A}{K_A} = \\alpha $$\n$$ \\frac{R'_T}{R_T} = 1 \\implies \\frac{R_T}{R'_T} = 1 $$\nSubstituting these knowns into the ratio equation:\n$$ \\alpha \\approx (\\alpha) \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau'}\\right) (1) $$\nThis equation is satisfied if and only if:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau'} \\approx 1 \\implies \\tau' \\approx \\tau $$\nThus, the combined observations are explained by an increase in the agonist's dissociation constant $K_A$ by a factor $\\alpha$, with no change in receptor density $R_T$ or efficacy $\\tau$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. An increase in the agonist’s equilibrium dissociation constant $K_A$ (decreased affinity), with receptor density $R_T$ and efficacy parameter $\\tau$ unchanged.**\n-   **Effect on Binding**: Increasing $K_A$ to $K'_A = \\alpha K_A$ will increase the half-maximal binding concentration $K_d$ by the same factor $\\alpha$, causing a rightward shift of the binding curve. With $R_T$ unchanged, $B_{\\max}$ is unchanged. This perfectly matches the first observation.\n-   **Effect on Signaling**: With $K_A$ increased by $\\alpha$ and both $\\tau$ and $R_T$ unchanged, the $EC_{50} \\approx \\frac{K_A K_E}{\\tau R_T}$ will also increase by the factor $\\alpha$. As long as the initial receptor reserve is sufficiently large, the maximal response will remain unchanged. This perfectly matches the second observation.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. A decrease in the efficacy parameter $\\tau$ (weaker receptor–effector coupling) with $K_A$ and $R_T$ unchanged.**\n-   **Effect on Binding**: In the standard model used here, the binding constant $K_A$ is an intrinsic property of the agonist-receptor pair and is independent of the downstream coupling parameter $\\tau$. Thus, a change in $\\tau$ would not affect the binding curve. This contradicts the observation of a rightward shift in binding.\n-   **Effect on Signaling**: A decrease in $\\tau$ would increase $EC_{50}$, causing a rightward shift. However, a significant decrease in $\\tau$ would reduce the maximal stimulus $\\tau R_T$, potentially causing a decrease in the observed maximal response, which is not seen. The primary failure is its inability to explain the binding data.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A decrease in receptor density $R_T$ with $K_A$ and $\\tau$ unchanged.**\n-   **Effect on Binding**: A decrease in receptor density $R_T$ would cause a proportional decrease in the maximal binding capacity $B_{\\max}$. The problem explicitly states that $B_{\\max}$ is unchanged. This is a direct contradiction.\n-   **Effect on Signaling**: A decrease in $R_T$ would increase $EC_{50}$, causing a rightward shift. Similar to option B, it could also decrease the maximal response. The critical flaw is the contradiction with the binding data.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Introduction of a noncompetitive antagonist that reduces the transduction efficiency of the receptor–effector step without altering the agonist’s binding affinity.**\n-   **Effect on Binding**: By definition, such an antagonist would not alter the agonist's binding curve. This contradicts the observed rightward shift in binding. A noncompetitive antagonist is pharmacologically equivalent to a reduction in the effective value of $\\tau$. This option is thus a mechanistic restatement of option B.\n-   **Effect on Signaling**: This would cause a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve and/or a depression of the maximum, depending on the degree of antagonism and receptor reserve.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. An increase in available heterotrimeric G protein concentration that enhances coupling efficiency between the receptor and G protein.**\n-   **Effect on Binding**: This corresponds to an *increase* in the effective efficacy parameter $\\tau$. In the simple model, this has no effect on binding. In more complex ternary complex models, this would stabilize the high-affinity agonist-bound state, causing a *leftward* shift in the binding curve, which is the opposite of the observation.\n-   **Effect on Signaling**: An increase in $\\tau$ would cause a *decrease* in $EC_{50} \\approx \\frac{K_A K_E}{\\tau R_T}$, corresponding to a *leftward* shift in the concentration-response curve. This is the opposite of the observed rightward shift.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2945834"}]}
