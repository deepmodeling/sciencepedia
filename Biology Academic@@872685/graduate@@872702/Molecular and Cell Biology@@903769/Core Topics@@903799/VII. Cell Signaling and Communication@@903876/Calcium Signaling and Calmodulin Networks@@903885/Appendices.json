It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysical chemistry, specifically the statistical mechanics of ligand binding to macromolecules. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing all necessary parameters and definitions for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by deriving the general expression for the fractional saturation of a single lobe. A lobe has two identical binding sites for calcium ions, denoted as $L$. Let the lobe be $P$. The system can exist in three states: the apo-state $P$ (no ligands bound), the singly-liganded state $PL$, and the doubly-liganded state $PL_2$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action at equilibrium, we can describe the system using a binding polynomial, $Z$, which is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states. The statistical weight of the apo-state $P$ is defined as $1$.\n\nThe binding of a ligand to a single site is characterized by the microscopic dissociation constant $K_D$, where $K_D = \\frac{[P_{\\text{site, free}}][L]}{[P_{\\text{site, bound}}]}$. The ratio $\\frac{[L]}{K_D}$ is the statistical weight for a single site to be occupied. Let the free calcium ion concentration be denoted by $[L] \\equiv [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$.\n\nFor the singly-liganded state $PL$, a ligand can bind to either of the two identical sites. Therefore, the statistical weight of this state is the sum of the weights for each possibility, which is $2 \\cdot \\frac{[L]}{K_D}$.\n\nFor the doubly-liganded state $PL_2$, both sites are occupied. In the absence of cooperativity, the statistical weight would be the product of the individual site occupancy weights, $(\\frac{[L]}{K_D})^2$. The problem states that a cooperativity factor $c$ multiplies this weight. Thus, the statistical weight of the state $PL_2$ is $c \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right)^2$.\n\nThe binding polynomial $Z$ is the sum of these weights:\n$$\nZ = 1 + 2 \\frac{[L]}{K_D} + c \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nThe average number of ligands bound per lobe, $\\langle \\nu \\rangle$, is the ratio of the sum of the number of ligands in each state multiplied by the state's statistical weight, to the binding polynomial:\n$$\n\\langle \\nu \\rangle = \\frac{(0 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 2 \\frac{[L]}{K_D}) + (2 \\cdot c (\\frac{[L]}{K_D})^2)}{Z} = \\frac{2 \\frac{[L]}{K_D} + 2c \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right)^2}{1 + 2 \\frac{[L]}{K_D} + c \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right)^2}\n$$\n\nThe fractional saturation, $\\theta$, is defined as the average number of bound ligands divided by the total number of binding sites per lobe, which is $2$.\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\langle \\nu \\rangle}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{2 \\frac{[L]}{K_D} + 2c \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right)^2}{1 + 2 \\frac{[L]}{K_D} + c \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right)^2} \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final equation for fractional saturation:\n$$\n\\theta([L], K_D, c) = \\frac{\\frac{[L]}{K_D} + c \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right)^2}{1 + 2 \\frac{[L]}{K_D} + c \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right)^2}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nWe now evaluate the fractional saturation for the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes at the specified calcium concentrations.

Converting the radius to micrometers: $r = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.03\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe diffusive escape time is given by the formula $t_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\sim r^2/(2D)$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\sim \\frac{(0.03\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times 220\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2}{440\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 2.05 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 2.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThis is the timescale on which a calcium ion released into the nanodomain will either bind to its target or escape a volume of this size by diffusion. For a buffer to be effective at suppressing the local calcium peak, it must capture calcium on a timescale comparable to or faster than $t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the characteristic binding time, $t_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, for each buffer. The formula provided is $t_{\\mathrm{bind}} \\sim 1/\\left(k_{\\mathrm{on}}[\\mathrm{B}]\\right)$, where $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the association rate constant and $[\\mathrm{B}]$ is the buffer concentration. The concentration is given as $[\\mathrm{B}] = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ for both buffers.\n\nFor BAPTA, the association rate constant is $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\sim 4\\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The characteristic binding time is:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\sim \\frac{1}{(4\\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{1}{4\\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nFor EGTA, the association rate constant is $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\sim 1\\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The characteristic binding time is:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\sim \\frac{1}{(1\\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{1}{1\\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nNow, we compare the timescales:\n- Diffusive escape time: $t_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx 2.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$\n- BAPTA binding time: $t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$\n- EGTA binding time: $t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe comparison is clear:\n- $t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$. BAPTA acts on a timescale very much comparable to the diffusive lifetime of calcium within the nanodomain. It is kinetically competent to compete with diffusion and the synaptic vesicle sensor for free calcium ions. Thus, BAPTA will effectively buffer the calcium concentration within the nanodomain and strongly suppress fast, synchronous exocytosis.\n\n- $t_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\gg t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$. The binding time for EGTA ($100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$) is approximately $50$ times longer than the diffusive escape time ($2.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$). Before an EGTA molecule has a high probability of capturing a calcium ion, that ion has long since diffused out of the nanodomain. Therefore, EGTA is a poor buffer for the rapid, local dynamics within the nanodomain and will have little effect on synchronous exocytosis. It can, however, affect processes that rely on the build-up of calcium over larger volumes (microdomains) and longer durations, where diffusive escape is slower and EGTA has sufficient time to act.\n\nThe fact that the equilibrium dissociation constants ($K_D$) are similar is a distractor. $K_D$ describes the system at equilibrium, whereas the triggering of exocytosis is a profoundly non-equilibrium event driven by kinetics. The initial rate of calcium capture ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) is the critical parameter, not the final equilibrium affinity ($K_D$).\n\nWith this rigorous analysis, we evaluate the provided options.\n\nA. BAPTA will strongly suppress synchronous nanodomain-mediated exocytosis, whereas EGTA will have little effect on synchronous release but can reduce slower, microdomain-dependent processes; this is because BAPTA’s calcium capture time is comparable to or faster than the nanodomain diffusive escape time, whereas EGTA’s is much slower.\nThis statement is a precise and accurate description of our findings. The reasoning provided is exactly correct, based on the comparison of the calculated timescales. This option is **Correct**.\n\nB. BAPTA and EGTA will suppress synchronous nanodomain-mediated exocytosis to a similar degree because they have similar $K_D$ values; initial binding kinetics are irrelevant for a brief calcium pulse.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly prioritizes equilibrium affinity ($K_D$) over binding kinetics ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) for a rapid, transient process. As demonstrated, the kinetics are vastly different and are the determining factor. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. EGTA will suppress synchronous nanodomain-mediated exocytosis more effectively than BAPTA because EGTA’s lower $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ (implied by similar $K_D$ and lower $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) sequesters calcium for longer near channels.\nThis statement is incorrect. The premise that EGTA is more effective is contrary to our calculations. The reasoning is also flawed; while a lower $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ means tighter binding, this is irrelevant if the initial capture (governed by $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) is too slow to occur before the calcium diffuses away. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Neither BAPTA nor EGTA at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ will significantly affect synchronous nanodomain-mediated exocytosis because diffusive escape from the nanodomain is much faster than any buffer can bind calcium.\nThis statement is partially correct in its assessment of EGTA, but it is definitively wrong about BAPTA. Our calculation shows that BAPTA's binding time is of the same order of magnitude as the diffusive escape time, meaning BAPTA is indeed fast enough to act as a significant buffer in the nanodomain. Therefore, the sweeping conclusion that neither buffer is effective is false. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option consistent with a rigorous, first-principles analysis is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2936682"}]}
