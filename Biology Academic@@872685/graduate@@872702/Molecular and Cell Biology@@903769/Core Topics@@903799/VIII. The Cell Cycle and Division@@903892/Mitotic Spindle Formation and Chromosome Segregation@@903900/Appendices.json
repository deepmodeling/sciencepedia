By treating the centromeric linkage as a simple linear spring, you can directly calculate the physical stretch caused by microtubule pulling forces, providing a tangible sense of the physical state that the cell monitors to ensure proper bipolar attachment [@problem_id:2955398].", "problem": "A single bivalent chromosome at metaphase is modeled as two sister kinetochores connected by an effective inter-kinetochore elastic linkage arising from centromeric chromatin and cohesin complexes. Assume this linkage behaves as a linear elastic element characterized by an effective stiffness $k$. Each sister kinetochore attaches to a kinetochore microtubule bundle (kinetochore fiber, abbreviated as k-fiber) that generates a steady poleward pulling force of magnitude $F_p$ directed toward its spindle pole. The system is symmetric, with identical forces applied to each sister kinetochore in opposite directions, and the configuration is at steady-state without acceleration.\n\nUsing only force balance at steady state and the linearity of the elastic response of the inter-kinetochore linkage, derive the steady-state increase in sister kinetochore separation $\\Delta x$ relative to the zero-tension separation of the linkage, and then compute its numerical value for $k = 10$ pN per micrometer and $F_p = 5$ pN. Express your final numerical result for $\\Delta x$ in micrometers and round to $3$ significant figures.\n\nBriefly comment, in your reasoning, on whether the magnitude of the predicted $\\Delta x$ is physiologically plausible compared to typical metaphase inter-kinetochore distances reported in human cells (on the order of $1.0$ to $1.5$ micrometers), but note that only the numerical value of $\\Delta x$ will be graded.", "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the increase in sister kinetochore separation, $\\Delta x$, under the influence of poleward pulling forces. The system is described as being at steady-state, which implies that the net force on each component is zero. Let us consider one of the sister kinetochores.\n\nTwo forces act on this kinetochore along the axis connecting the spindle poles:\n$1$. The poleward pulling force, $F_p$, exerted by the kinetochore microtubule bundle (k-fiber). Its magnitude is given as $F_p$.\n$2$. The elastic restoring force, $F_e$, exerted by the inter-kinetochore linkage. This force opposes the stretch and pulls the kinetochore toward its sister.\n\nAccording to Newton's first law, for a body in equilibrium (steady-state with zero acceleration), the vector sum of all forces acting on it must be zero. Considering the magnitudes of the forces along the pole-to-pole axis, the pulling force and the restoring force must be equal in magnitude:\n$$F_p = F_e$$\n\nThe problem states that the inter-kinetochore linkage behaves as a linear elastic element. This is an application of Hooke's Law, which relates the force exerted by an elastic element to its extension. The force is directly proportional to the amount of stretch from its equilibrium, or zero-tension, length. The constant of proportionality is the stiffness, $k$.\nThe increase in sister kinetochore separation relative to the zero-tension separation is precisely the extension of this elastic linkage, which the problem defines as $\\Delta x$. Therefore, the magnitude of the elastic restoring force is given by:\n$$F_e = k \\Delta x$$\n\nBy substituting this expression for $F_e$ into the force balance equation, we obtain:\n$$F_p = k \\Delta x$$\n\nOur objective is to find $\\Delta x$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the extension:\n$$\\Delta x = \\frac{F_p}{k}$$\nThis expression is the derived steady-state increase in sister kinetochore separation.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n- The magnitude of the poleward pulling force, $F_p = 5 \\text{ pN}$.\n- The effective stiffness of the linkage, $k = 10 \\text{ pN per micrometer}$, which is equivalent to $k = 10 \\frac{\\text{pN}}{\\mu\\text{m}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\\Delta x = \\frac{5 \\text{ pN}}{10 \\frac{\\text{pN}}{\\mu\\text{m}}}$$\nThe units of piconewtons ($\\text{pN}$) cancel, leaving the result in micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$), as required.\n$$\\Delta x = 0.5 \\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. To express $0.5$ with three significant figures, we write it as $0.500$.\n$$\\Delta x = 0.500 \\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nFinally, a comment on the physiological plausibility is required. The calculated increase in separation is $\\Delta x = 0.5 \\mu\\text{m}$. Experimental observations in human cells report total metaphase inter-kinetochore distances in the range of $1.0$ to $1.5 \\mu\\text{m}$. The total distance is the sum of the zero-tension separation ($d_0$) and the stretch ($\\Delta x$). Thus, our result implies a zero-tension separation of $d_0 = (1.0 \\ldots 1.5) \\mu\\text{m} - 0.5 \\mu\\text{m} = (0.5 \\ldots 1.0) \\mu\\text{m}$. A stretch of $0.5 \\mu\\text{m}$ represents a substantial strain (relative extension) of $50\\%-100\\%$ on the linkage. While this is a large deformation, it is not outside the realm of plausibility for complex biological structures like centromeric chromatin under tension. The linear elastic model is a simplification, and nonlinear stiffening could occur at such large strains. However, for a first-order model, the calculated value is of the correct order of magnitude and is therefore considered physiologically plausible within the context of this simplified model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.500}$$", "id": "2955398"}, {"introduction": "The metaphase spindle, while appearing stable, is a highly dynamic structure maintained by a constant flow of microtubule subunits known as poleward flux.

The stripe moves a distance $\\Delta x = 1.5 \\, \\mu m$ toward the pole over a time interval of $\\Delta t=180 \\, s$. The speed is the magnitude of the displacement divided by the time interval.\n\n$$v_{\\text{flux}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$$v_{\\text{flux}} = \\frac{1.5 \\, \\mu m}{180 \\, s} = 0.008333... \\, \\frac{\\mu m}{s}$$\n\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we express this in scientific notation:\n\n$$v_{\\text{flux}} \\approx 8.33 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mu m}{s}$$\n\n**Part 2: Inference of Minus-End Depolymerization Speed, $v_{-}$**\n\nWe must analyze the dynamics of the k-fiber under the specified steady-state conditions. Let us establish a one-dimensional coordinate system with its origin ($x=0$) at the spindle pole and the positive direction pointing towards the metaphase plate (and the kinetochore).\n\nThe k-fiber's minus end is at position $x_{m}(t)$, and its plus end is at position $x_{p}(t)$. Its length is $L(t) = x_{p}(t) - x_{m}(t)$.\nThe problem states that the k-fiber length is constant, which means $\\frac{dL}{dt} = 0$. This implies:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x_{p}(t) - x_{m}(t) \\right) = \\frac{dx_{p}}{dt} - \\frac{dx_{m}}{dt} = 0$$\n$$\\implies \\frac{dx_{p}}{dt} = \\frac{dx_{m}}{dt}$$\n\nThis equation signifies that the velocities of the plus and minus ends of the k-fiber in the laboratory frame of reference are identical.\n\nFurthermore, the problem states that the chromosome remains stationary at the metaphase plate. Since the plus end of the k-fiber is attached to the kinetochore on the chromosome, the plus end must also be stationary. Therefore, its velocity is zero:\n\n$$\\frac{dx_{p}}{dt} = 0$$\n\nCombining these results, we find that the minus end of the k-fiber must also be stationary:\n\n$$\\frac{dx_{m}}{dt} = 0$$\n\nNow, we relate these macroscopic conditions to the underlying molecular processes. The velocity of any point on the microtubule lattice is given by the poleward flux, which moves material towards the pole (in the negative $x$ direction). Thus, the lattice velocity is $-v_{\\text{flux}}$.\n\nThe velocity of the minus end, $\\frac{dx_{m}}{dt}$, is the sum of two contributions: the velocity of the lattice itself ($-v_{\\text{flux}}$) and the velocity of the end relative to the lattice due to depolymerization. The problem defines $v_{-}$ as a positive scalar for subunit loss at the minus end. This loss \"eats into\" the filament, causing the end position $x_{m}$ to move in the positive $x$ direction relative to the lattice at a speed of $v_{-}$.\n\nTherefore, the net velocity of the minus end is:\n\n$$\\frac{dx_{m}}{dt} = (\\text{velocity from depolymerization}) + (\\text{velocity from flux})$$\n$$\\frac{dx_{m}}{dt} = v_{-} - v_{\\text{flux}}$$\n\nAs we have already established that $\\frac{dx_{m}}{dt} = 0$ for the minus end to remain stationary, we arrive at the central relationship:\n\n$$0 = v_{-} - v_{\\text{flux}}$$\n$$\\implies v_{-} = v_{\\text{flux}}$$\n\nThis result shows that, for the spindle to be in the described steady state (constant k-fiber length with a stationary chromosome), the rate of microtubule depolymerization at the minus end must exactly balance the rate of poleward flux. This phenomenon is a key feature of microtubule treadmilling in the metaphase spindle.\n\nThus, the value of $v_{-}$ is identical to the value of $v_{\\text{flux}}$:\n\n$$v_{-} = v_{\\text{flux}} \\approx 8.33 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mu m}{s}$$\n\nThe results for both velocities, rounded to $3$ significant figures, are $v_{\\text{flux}} = 8.33 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mu m}{s}$ and $v_{-} = 8.33 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mu m}{s}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8.33 \\times 10^{-3} & 8.33 \\times 10^{-3} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2955436"}, {"introduction": "Accurate chromosome segregation is ensured by a sophisticated surveillance mechanism, the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC).

The problem states that each of the $n_u(t)$ kinetochores attaches to the spindle independently with a constant rate $k_a$. This describes a first-order decay process. The rate of change of $n_u(t)$ is therefore the negative of the attachment rate multiplied by the current number of unattached kinetochores. This gives the following ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dn_u}{dt} = -k_a n_u(t) $$\nwith the initial condition $n_u(0) = N$.\n\nNext, we formulate the equation for the MCC concentration, $M(t)$. The rate of change of $M(t)$ is the sum of its production rate and its degradation rate.\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Production}) - (\\text{Rate of Degradation}) $$\nThe production of MCC is catalyzed by the $n_u(t)$ unattached kinetochores. Assuming the total production rate is proportional to the number of active catalytic sites, this rate is given by $k_{Mps1} n_u(t)$.\nThe degradation of MCC follows first-order kinetics with a rate constant $k_d$. This rate is given by $k_d M(t)$.\nCombining these terms yields the second ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = k_{Mps1} n_u(t) - k_d M(t) $$\nwith the initial condition $M(0) = 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Solution of the Coupled System**\n\nWe have a system of two coupled linear ordinary differential equations.

Its solution is an exponential decay function:\n$$ n_u(t) = n_u(0) \\exp(-k_a t) $$\nApplying the initial condition $n_u(0) = N$, we obtain:\n$$ n_u(t) = N \\exp(-k_a t) $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $n_u(t)$ into the equation for $M(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = k_{Mps1} (N \\exp(-k_a t)) - k_d M(t) $$\nThis can be rewritten in the standard form for a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} + k_d M(t) = N k_{Mps1} \\exp(-k_a t) $$\nTo solve this equation, we use the method of integrating factors.
