Consider a single unordered, non-additive, binary morphological character with observed states: $A:0$, $B:1$, $C:1$, $D:0$. External evidence independently polarizes the character so that state $0$ is ancestral (plesiomorphic) and state $1$ is derived (apomorphic). Using the principle of Maximum Parsimony (MP), compute the following parsimony indices for this single character on the specified tree: the minimum possible number of steps for this character on any tree $m$, the number of steps on the given tree $s$, the Consistency Index (CI), and the Retention Index (RI). Then, interpret these values to explain the homoplasy signal: state clearly whether the observed similarity of the derived state between $B$ and $C$ represents homology or homoplasy on this tree, and, given the polarity, what kind of homoplasy is implied by the mapping.\n\nProvide exact values; no rounding is required. Express the final answer as the ordered quadruple $\\left(m, s, CI, RI\\right)$.", "solution": "We begin from the core definitions in phylogenetic systematics. A character is a heritable trait with discrete character states. Character polarity identifies which state is ancestral (plesiomorphic) and which is derived (apomorphic), typically established by external evidence such as outgroup comparison. Under Maximum Parsimony (MP), the optimal mapping of a character onto a fixed tree minimizes the number of inferred state changes (steps). The minimum number of steps possible for a character across all trees, denoted $m$, is determined by the character’s distribution alone, not by any particular topology. For unordered characters with $r$ observed states, the well-known lower bound is $m = r - 1$. The number of steps on a given tree, denoted $s$, is the minimum count of changes needed to reconcile the observed states with that tree, obtained by algorithms such as the Fitch algorithm. To quantify fit and homoplasy, the Consistency Index (CI) is defined as $CI = \\frac{m}{s}$, and the Retention Index (RI) is defined as $RI = \\frac{g - s}{g - m}$, where $g$ is the maximum possible number of steps for the character across all trees consistent with the observed tip states.\n\nStep 1: Determine $m$ from the character distribution.\nThe character is binary with two observed states, $0$ and $1$; hence $r = 2$, and the general lower bound for unordered characters gives\n$$\nm = r - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\n$$\n\nStep 2: Compute $s$ on the specified tree $((A,B),(C,D))$ using the Fitch set method.\nAssign tip states: $A:0$, $B:1$, $C:1$, $D:0$. For the internal node joining $A$ and $B$, the descendant sets are $\\{0\\}$ and $\\{1\\}$; their intersection is empty, so the node set becomes $\\{0,1\\}$ and we incur $1$ step. Similarly, for the internal node joining $C$ and $D$, the descendant sets are $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{0\\}$; the intersection is empty, we assign $\\{0,1\\}$ and incur another $1$ step. For the central edge connecting the two internal nodes, the sets are $\\{0,1\\}$ and $\\{0,1\\}$; the intersection is nonempty, so no additional step is required. Therefore,\n$$\ns = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n$$\n\nStep 3: Compute $CI$.\nBy definition,\n$$\nCI = \\frac{m}{s} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nStep 4: Determine $g$ and compute $RI$.\nFor a binary unordered character with observed counts $n_{0}$ and $n_{1}$ of states $0$ and $1$ among $n$ taxa, the maximum parsimony steps across all trees equals\n$$\ng = \\min\\{n_{0}, n_{1}\\},\n$$\nbecause, at most, the number of steps can be forced to equal the number of instances of the minority state when arranged to maximize changes (and this bound is attainable on appropriate trees). Here, $n_{0} = 2$ and $n_{1} = 2$, so\n$$\ng = \\min\\{2,2\\} = 2.\n$$\nThe Retention Index (RI) is defined as\n$$\nRI = \\frac{g - s}{g - m} = \\frac{2 - 2}{2 - 1} = 0.\n$$\n\nStep 5: Interpret the homoplasy signal with polarity.\nWith state $0$ polarized as ancestral and state $1$ as derived, the mapping of this character onto the given tree requires $s = 2$ changes, exceeding the minimum $m = 1$. Because $CI = \\frac{1}{2} < 1$ and $RI = 0$, the character exhibits homoplasy on this topology, and, relative to its homoplasy potential, it retains none of the expected synapomorphic signal (a zero Retention Index). Specifically, on this tree, the two occurrences of state $1$ in $B$ and $C$ are not explained by a single homologous origin uniting them as sister lineages; instead, the polarized mapping implies either two independent gains of the derived state (convergent evolution, a form of analogy) or a gain followed by a reversal elsewhere. Either explanation constitutes homoplasy, and the value $RI = 0$ indicates that the character displays the maximum number of steps it can possibly have given its distribution ($g = 2$), leaving no retained synapomorphy for the derived state on this topology.\n\nIn summary, the computed indices are\n$$\nm = 1,\\quad s = 2,\\quad CI = \\frac{1}{2},\\quad RI = 0,\n$$\nand the character is homoplastic on the specified tree, with the polarization indicating a scenario of convergence or reversal rather than a single homologous apomorphy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & \\frac{1}{2} & 0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2553250"}, {"introduction": "An inference of homoplasy depends critically on our hypothesis of character polarity—that is, which state is ancestral and which is derived.

It presents a standard exercise in phylogenetic character analysis based on the principle of maximum parsimony. All data and definitions required for a unique solution are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe given information is as follows:\n- Taxa: Five taxa, comprising two outgroups $\\{O1, O2\\}$ and three ingroup taxa $\\{A, B, C\\}$.\n- Character states: A single unordered binary character with observed states $O1:0$, $O2:0$, $A:1$, $B:1$, and $C:0$.\n- Unrooted Topology: The tree structure is specified as $( (O1, O2), (C, (A,B)) )$. This topology indicates that the taxa are partitioned into three groups connected to a central node: the clade $\\{O1, O2\\}$, the taxon $C$, and the clade $\\{A,B\\}$.\n\nThe task is to compute a scalar summary $S$ derived from the number of character state changes (steps) under different rooting scenarios and ancestral state assumptions. The number of steps is determined by applying the Fitch algorithm for unordered characters on a rooted tree for a fixed root state assignment.\n\nPart 1: Standard Outgroup Rooting\nThe root is placed on the branch separating the outgroup clade $\\{O1,O2\\}$ from the ingroup clade $\\{A,B,C\\}$. The resulting rooted topology is $( (O1,O2), (C,(A,B)) )$. We must compute the number of steps required for two alternative ancestral state assignments at this root.\n\nCase 1: Ancestral state is $0$.\nThe states of the outgroups $O1$ and $O2$ are both $0$. The outgroup criterion suggests that $0$ is the plesiomorphic (ancestral) state for the ingroup. Assigning state $0$ to the root is thus the most parsimonious hypothesis.\n- The state at the root is $0$.\n- The branch leading to the outgroup clade $\\{O1,O2\\}$ requires no change, as the shared ancestral state of $O1$ and $O2$ is unambiguously $0$.\n- Within the ingroup, taxon $C$ has state $0$, consistent with the ancestral state at the ingroup root. No change is required on the branch to $C$.\n- The clade $\\{A,B\\}$ has state $1$. To explain this, a single state change from $0 \\to 1$ must be postulated on the branch leading to the common ancestor of $A$ and $B$. This is a synapomorphy for the clade $\\{A,B\\}$. The shared state $1$ in $A$ and $B$ is thus interpreted as homologous.\nThe total number of steps is $1$.\nSo, $\\text{steps}(0) = 1$.\n\nCase 2: Ancestral state is $1$.\n- The state at the root is $1$.\n- The branch leading to the outgroup clade $\\{O1,O2\\}$, where the state is $0$, requires a state change $1 \\to 0$. This is one step.\n- Within the ingroup, the branch leading to taxon $C$, which has state $0$, requires another state change $1 \\to 0$. This is a second step.\n- The branch leading to clade $\\{A,B\\}$, where the state is $1$, requires no change.\nThis reconstruction postulates two independent reversals from state $1$ to state $0$.

Here, the taxa are partitioned into two monophyletic groups according to their character state: $\\{A,B\\}$ with state $1$ and $\\{C,O1,O2\\}$ with state $0$.\n\nCase 2.1.1: Ancestral state is $0$.\n- Starting with state $0$ at the root, no change is needed for the lineage leading to $\\{C,O1,O2\\}$.\n- A single change $0 \\to 1$ is required on the branch leading to the clade $\\{A,B\\}$.\nThe total number of steps is $1$.

It is a self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed problem in phylogenetics. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe primary task is to determine the most parsimonious reconstructions of character evolution on the given topology and to compare the results under ACCTRAN and DELTRAN optimizations.\n\nFirst, we establish the nodal relationships and label the internal nodes of the tree for clarity. The topology, rooted by the outgroup $O$, is:\n$N_R = \\text{MRCA}(O, \\text{Ingroup})$\n$N_1 = \\text{MRCA}(A,B,C,D,E,F)$\n$N_2 = \\text{MRCA}(A,B,C)$\n$N_3 = \\text{MRCA}(A,B)$\n$N_4 = \\text{MRCA}(D,E,F)$\n$N_5 = \\text{MRCA}(E,F)$\n\nThe states at the tips are: $X(A)=1, X(B)=0, X(C)=1, X(D)=0, X(E)=0, X(F)=0$, and $X(O)=0$.\n\n**1. Parsimony Score Calculation (Fitch's Algorithm, Down-pass)**\n\nWe calculate the minimum number of character state changes (the parsimony score or length, $L$) required to explain the observed distribution of states. This is done via a post-order traversal (down-pass) of the tree, assigning a set of possible states to each internal node.\n- At $N_3 = \\text{MRCA}(A,B)$: State sets are $\\{1\\}$ for $A$ and $\\{0\\}$ for $B$. Their intersection is empty. The union is $\\{0,1\\}$. This step adds $1$ to the score. $S(N_3) = \\{0,1\\}$, $L \\gets 1$.\n- At $N_5 = \\text{MRCA}(E,F)$: State sets are $\\{0\\}$ for $E$ and $\\{0\\}$ for $F$. Their intersection is $\\{0\\}$. $S(N_5) = \\{0\\}$.\n- At $N_2 = \\text{MRCA}(N_3,C)$: State sets are $S(N_3)=\\{0,1\\}$ and $S(C)=\\{1\\}$. Their intersection is $\\{1\\}$. $S(N_2) = \\{1\\}$.\n- At $N_4 = \\text{MRCA}(D,N_5)$: State sets are $S(D)=\\{0\\}$ and $S(N_5)=\\{0\\}$. Their intersection is $\\{0\\}$. $S(N_4) = \\{0\\}$.\n- At $N_1 = \\text{MRCA}(N_2,N_4)$: State sets are $S(N_2)=\\{1\\}$ and $S(N_4)=\\{0\\}$. Their intersection is empty. The union is $\\{0,1\\}$. This step adds another $1$ to the score. $S(N_1) = \\{0,1\\}$, $L \\gets 1+1=2$.\n- At the root $N_R = \\text{MRCA}(O, N_1)$: State sets are $S(O)=\\{0\\}$ and $S(N_1)=\\{0,1\\}$. Their intersection is $\\{0\\}$. $S(N_R) = \\{0\\}$.\n\nThe total parsimony score for this character on this tree is $L=2$. This means a minimum of $2$ state changes are required. The existence of multiple nodes where the down-pass required a union operation (here, $N_3$ and $N_1$) indicates ambiguity in an unordered parsimony framework, leading to multiple Most Parsimonious Reconstructions (MPRs). ACCTRAN and DELTRAN are two alternative conventions for resolving this ambiguity.\n\n**2. ACCTRAN (Accelerated Transformation) Optimization**\n\nACCTRAN resolves ambiguity by favoring transformations earlier (closer to the root) on the tree. This tends to create single origins followed by reversals, rather than multiple parallel origins.\n- The root state is $0$.\n- Following the principle of placing changes early, a single gain ($0 \\to 1$) is hypothesized on the branch leading to $N_2 = \\text{MRCA}(A,B,C)$, as this is the earliest point that can explain the states in that clade. Thus, $X(N_2)=1$.\n- The state $1$ is inherited by $C$ and by $N_3 = \\text{MRCA}(A,B)$. So, $X(N_3)=1$.\n- Taxon $A$ inherits state $1$.\n- Taxon $B$ has state $0$. This requires a reversal ($1 \\to 0$) on the branch leading to $B$.\n- The clade $(D,(E,F))$ retains the ancestral state $0$ throughout.\n- Under this reconstruction:\n  - There is $1$ gain ($0 \\to 1$) on the branch leading to $N_2$.\n  - There is $1$ reversal ($1 \\to 0$) on the branch leading to $B$.\n- The total number of steps is $1+1=2$, which is consistent with the parsimony score.\n- **Homology**: The state $1$ in taxa $A$ and $C$ is derived from their most recent common ancestor, $N_2$, which is reconstructed with state $1$. The state is therefore inferred to be **homologous** under ACCTRAN.\n\n**3. DELTRAN (Delayed Transformation) Optimization**\n\nDELTRAN resolves ambiguity by favoring transformations later (closer to the tips) on the tree. This tends to minimize reversals at the expense of inferring parallel gains (homoplasy).\n- The root state is $0$.\n- To delay changes, the ancestral state $0$ is assumed to be retained as far down the tree as possible.\n- The nodes $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$ are all reconstructed with state $0$.\n- The observed state $1$ in taxon $A$ is explained by a gain ($0 \\to 1$) on the terminal branch leading to $A$.\n- The observed state $1$ in taxon $C$ is explained by a separate, independent gain ($0 \\to 1$) on the terminal branch leading to $C$.\n- All other taxa have state $0$, which is consistent with their ancestors having state $0$. No reversals are necessary.\n- Under this reconstruction:\n  - There are $2$ gains ($0 \\to 1$): one on the branch to $A$ and one on the branch to $C$.\n  - There are $0$ reversals.\n- The total number of steps is $2+0=2$, also consistent with the parsimony score.\n- **Homology**: The state $1$ in taxa $A$ and $C$ arose independently. Their most recent common ancestor, $N_2$, is reconstructed with state $0$. The state is therefore inferred to be **analogous (homoplastic)** under DELTRAN.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. Under ACCTRAN there are $1$ gain and $1$ reversal; under DELTRAN there are $2$ gains and $0$ reversals; $A$ and $C$ share homologous state $1$ under ACCTRAN but analogous (homoplastic) state $1$ under DELTRAN.**\n  - This statement precisely matches the derived results for both ACCTRAN and DELTRAN, including the number of gains/reversals and the resulting homology assessment.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B.
