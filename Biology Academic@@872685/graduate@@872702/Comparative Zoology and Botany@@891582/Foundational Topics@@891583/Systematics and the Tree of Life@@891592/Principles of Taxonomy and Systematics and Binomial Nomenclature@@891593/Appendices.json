It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) as described by the Multispecies Coalescent model for a three-taxon case. For a species tree with the topology $((A, B), C)$, there are three possible rooted gene tree topologies for a sample of one lineage from each species: the concordant topology $((A, B), C)$, and two discordant topologies, $((A, C), B)$ and $((B, C), A)$.\n\nThe probability of obtaining a discordant gene tree is a direct function of the length of the internal branch of the species tree, measured in coalescent units. The probability that two gene lineages, sampled from sister species A and B, fail to coalesce in their common ancestral population is given by $\\exp(-T)$, where $T$ is the duration of that ancestral population (the internal branch) in coalescent units. If they fail to coalesce, all three lineages (from A, B, and C) enter the deeper ancestral population. Under neutrality, any pair of these three lineages is then equally likely to coalesce first, with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ for each pairing. The gene tree topology will be concordant, i.e., $((A, B), C)$, only if lineages A and B coalesce first. The other two pairings, (A, C) and (B, C), result in discordant topologies.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of obtaining a discordant gene tree is the probability of non-coalescence on the internal branch multiplied by the probability of a discordant coalescence event in the deep ancestor:\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{discordant}) = \\exp(-T) \\times \\left( \\Pr(A,C \\text{ coalesce first}) + \\Pr(B,C \\text{ coalesce first}) \\right) = \\exp(-T) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-T)\n$$\n\nThe length of the internal branch in generations, $\\tau$, is the time between the two speciation events:\n$$\n\\tau = t_{ABC} - t_{AB} = (3.2 \\times 10^{5}) - (2.0 \\times 10^{5}) = 1.2 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ generations}\n$$\nThe length of this branch in coalescent units, $T$, depends on the effective population size $N_e$ and the ploidy of the locus. The rate of coalescence for two lineages is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$ for a diploid locus and $\\frac{1}{N_e}$ for a haploid locus. The branch length $T$ is the product of the time in generations and the coalescence rate.\n\nFirst, we calculate $T$ for the diploid nuclear locus, $T_{\\text{nuc}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\text{nuc}} = \\frac{\\tau}{2 N_{e}^{\\text{nuc}}} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{5}}{2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{5})} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{5}}{5.0 \\times 10^{5}} = 0.24\n$$\nThe probability of a discordant nuclear gene tree, $\\Pr(\\text{nuc discordant})$, is:\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{nuc discordant}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-T_{\\text{nuc}}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-0.24)\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate $T$ for the haploid cpDNA locus, $T_{\\text{cp}}$. The effective population size for a maternally inherited haploid organelle is typically one-quarter that of a biparentally inherited diploid nuclear gene, assuming equal sex ratio and variance in reproductive success. The given values $N_{e}^{\\text{cp}} = 6.25 \\times 10^4$ and $N_{e}^{\\text{nuc}} = 2.5 \\times 10^5$ are consistent with this expectation, as $\\frac{N_{e}^{\\text{nuc}}}{4} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^5}{4} = 6.25 \\times 10^4 = N_{e}^{\\text{cp}}$.\n$$\nT_{\\text{cp}} = \\frac{\\tau}{N_{e}^{\\text{cp}}} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{5}}{6.25 \\times 10^{4}} = 1.92\n$$\nThe probability of a discordant cpDNA gene tree, $\\Pr(\\text{cpDNA discordant})$, is:\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{cpDNA discordant}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-T_{\\text{cp}}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-1.92)\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio, $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Pr(\\text{nuc discordant})}{\\Pr(\\text{cpDNA discordant})} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-T_{\\text{nuc}})}{\\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-T_{\\text{cp}})} = \\frac{\\exp(-0.24)}{\\exp(-1.92)}\n$$\nUsing the properties of exponents, this simplifies to:\n$$\nR = \\exp(-0.24 - (-1.92)) = \\exp(1.92 - 0.24) = \\exp(1.68)\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\nR \\approx 5.365555...\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 5.366\n$$\nThe result indicates that a nuclear gene tree is substantially more likely to be discordant with the species tree than a cpDNA gene tree under these conditions.

Let $x$ be the distance variable.\nFor the intraspecific (conspecific) class $\\omega_w$, the distribution is $N(\\mu_w, \\sigma_w^2)$, with probability density function:\n$$p(x | \\omega_w) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_w} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_w)^2}{2\\sigma_w^2}\\right)$$\nFor the interspecific (heterospecific) class $\\omega_b$, the distribution is $N(\\mu_b, \\sigma_b^2)$, with probability density function:\n$$p(x | \\omega_b) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_b)^2}{2\\sigma_b^2}\\right)$$\nThe prior probabilities are given as $P(\\omega_w) = \\pi_w$ and $P(\\omega_b) = \\pi_b$.\n\nSubstituting these into the decision boundary equation at $x=\\tau$:\n$$\\frac{\\pi_w}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_w} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\tau - \\mu_w)^2}{2\\sigma_w^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi_b}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\tau - \\mu_b)^2}{2\\sigma_b^2}\\right)$$\n\nTo solve for $\\tau$, we first take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_w}{\\sigma_w}\\right) - \\frac{(\\tau - \\mu_w)^2}{2\\sigma_w^2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_b}{\\sigma_b}\\right) - \\frac{(\\tau - \\mu_b)^2}{2\\sigma_b^2}$$\nRearranging the terms to group those involving $\\tau$:\n$$\\frac{(\\tau - \\mu_b)^2}{2\\sigma_b^2} - \\frac{(\\tau - \\mu_w)^2}{2\\sigma_w^2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_b}{\\sigma_b}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_w}{\\sigma_w}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_b \\sigma_w}{\\pi_w \\sigma_b}\\right)$$\nMultiply by $2$ and expand the quadratic terms:\n$$\\frac{\\tau^2 - 2\\tau\\mu_b + \\mu_b^2}{\\sigma_b^2} - \\frac{\\tau^2 - 2\\tau\\mu_w + \\mu_w^2}{\\sigma_w^2} = 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_b \\sigma_w}{\\pi_w \\sigma_b}\\right)$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\tau$ of the form $A\\tau^2 + B\\tau + C = 0$. We collect the coefficients of $\\tau^2$, $\\tau$, and the constant terms:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_b^2} - \\frac{1}{\\sigma_w^2}$$\n$$B = -2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_b}{\\sigma_b^2} - \\frac{\\mu_w}{\\sigma_w^2}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_w}{\\sigma_w^2} - \\frac{\\mu_b}{\\sigma_b^2}\\right)$$\n$$C = \\frac{\\mu_b^2}{\\sigma_b^2} - \\frac{\\mu_w^2}{\\sigma_w^2} - 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_b \\sigma_w}{\\pi_w \\sigma_b}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\mu_{w} = 0.007$, $\\sigma_{w} = 0.003$\n$\\mu_{b} = 0.12$, $\\sigma_{b} = 0.04$\n$\\pi_{w} = 0.65$, $\\pi_{b} = 0.35$\n\nWe compute the variances:\n$\\sigma_w^2 = (0.003)^2 = 9 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$\\sigma_b^2 = (0.04)^2 = 1.6 \\times 10^{-3}$\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{1.6 \\times 10^{-3}} - \\frac{1}{9 \\times 10^{-6}} = 625 - 111111.\\overline{1} = -110486.\\overline{1}$$\n$$B = 2\\left(\\frac{0.007}{9 \\times 10^{-6}} - \\frac{0.12}{1.6 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right) = 2(777.\\overline{7} - 75) = 2(702.\\overline{7}) = 1405.\\overline{5}$$\nFor coefficient $C$:\n$$C = \\left(\\frac{(0.12)^2}{1.6 \\times 10^{-3}} - \\frac{(0.007)^2}{9 \\times 10^{-6}}\\right) - 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.35 \\times 0.003}{0.65 \\times 0.04}\\right)$$\n$$C = \\left(9 - 5.\\overline{4}\\right) - 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.00105}{0.026}\\right) = 3.\\overline{5} - 2\\ln(0.0403846...)$$\n$$C \\approx 3.5555... - 2(-3.2093) = 3.5555... + 6.4186... \\approx 9.974163$$\n\nThe quadratic equation for $\\tau$ is:\n$$-110486.11 \\tau^2 + 1405.56 \\tau + 9.974163 = 0$$\nWe solve using the quadratic formula, $\\tau = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{-1405.56 \\pm \\sqrt{(1405.56)^2 - 4(-110486.11)(9.974163)}}{2(-110486.11)}$$\n$$\\tau = \\frac{-1405.56 \\pm \\sqrt{1975580.2 + 4408119.5}}{-220972.22}$$\n$$\\tau = \\frac{-1405.56 \\pm \\sqrt{6383699.7}}{-220972.22} \\approx \\frac{-1405.56 \\pm 2526.60}{-220972.22}$$\n\nThis yields two possible solutions for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau_1 = \\frac{-1405.56 - 2526.60}{-220972.22} = \\frac{-3932.16}{-220972.22} \\approx 0.017795...$$\n$$\\tau_2 = \\frac{-1405.56 + 2526.60}{-220972.22} = \\frac{1121.04}{-220972.22} \\approx -0.005073$$\n\nThe K2P distance $X$ is, by definition, a non-negative quantity.
