This exercise explores the physical consequences of this size disparity by examining the efficiency of intracellular transport. By applying the principles of diffusion, you will perform a calculation that reveals why the simple passive movement of molecules, sufficient for a small bacterium, becomes critically limiting in a larger eukaryotic cell, thereby necessitating the evolution of complex, active transport networks like the cytoskeleton [@problem_id:2605930].", "problem": "Consider intracellular transport constrained by thermal diffusion of a protein-sized tracer in a homogeneous cytosol. Starting from the diffusion equation and the one-dimensional mean-squared displacement for Brownian motion, $\\langle x^{2}(t)\\rangle=2 D t$, derive an order-of-magnitude estimate for the characteristic time $t$ required for a molecule to explore a linear extent $L$ along a single Cartesian axis.

It is based on the fundamental principles of Fickian diffusion and provides realistic physical parameters. Therefore, I will proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the characteristic time, $t$, for a molecule to traverse a linear distance, $L$, by diffusion. The starting point is the one-dimensional mean-squared displacement (MSD) for a particle undergoing Brownian motion:\n$$\n\\langle x^{2}(t)\\rangle = 2 D t\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the translational diffusion coefficient, $t$ is time, and $\\langle x^{2}(t)\\rangle$ is the average of the square of the displacement along a single Cartesian axis, $x$.\n\nThe characteristic time to explore a linear extent $L$ can be defined as the time at which the root-mean-squared displacement (RMSD), $\\sqrt{\\langle x^{2}(t)\\rangle}$, becomes comparable to the distance $L$. This is a standard and physically meaningful convention for an order-of-magnitude estimate. Setting the RMSD equal to $L$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\langle x^{2}(t)\\rangle} = L\n$$\nSquaring both sides yields:\n$$\n\\langle x^{2}(t)\\rangle = L^{2}\n$$\nBy substituting this into the MSD equation, we can solve for the characteristic time $t$:\n$$\nL^{2} = 2 D t\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{L^{2}}{2D}\n$$\nThis equation reveals that the characteristic diffusion time scales quadratically with the distance and inversely with the diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe use of a one-dimensional projection to estimate the time to cross a cell's diameter is justified by the nature of diffusion. In three dimensions, the total displacement vector is $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j} + z\\hat{k}$. The squared displacement is $r^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}$. For an isotropic medium, the diffusive motions along the orthogonal axes $x$, $y$, and $z$ are statistically independent. Consequently, the mean-squared displacement in three dimensions is the sum of the one-dimensional components:\n$$\n\\langle r^{2}(t) \\rangle = \\langle x^{2}(t) \\rangle + \\langle y^{2}(t) \\rangle + \\langle z^{2}(t) \\rangle\n$$\nDue to isotropy, $\\langle x^{2}(t) \\rangle = \\langle y^{2}(t) \\rangle = \\langle z^{2}(t) \\rangle$. Thus, the motion along any single pre-defined axis (e.g., the diameter of the cell) can be considered independently. To cross the cell, a molecule must achieve a net displacement of approximately $L$ along the axis defined by the diameter. The random movements in the directions perpendicular to this axis do not contribute to this crossing. Therefore, the time required for the mean-squared displacement *along this one specific axis* to equal $L^2$ provides the correct scaling and order-of-magnitude estimate for the transit time.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values. First, all units must be made consistent. The diffusion coefficient is given in $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$, so we convert the lengths from micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) to centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$).\nGiven $1~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm}$:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{bact}} = 1.00~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{euk}} = 20.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 20.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nThe diffusion coefficient is $D = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nWe can now calculate the characteristic time for the bacterial cell, $t_{\\mathrm{bact}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{bact}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{bact}}^{2}}{2D} = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm})^{2}}{2 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{2.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}} = 0.05~\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the characteristic time for the eukaryotic cell, $t_{\\mathrm{euk}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{euk}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{euk}}^{2}}{2D} = \\frac{(2.00 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm})^{2}}{2 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{4.00 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{2.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}} = 20~\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R \\equiv t_{\\mathrm{euk}}/t_{\\mathrm{bact}}$. This can be done either from the derived formula or the calculated values. Using the formula:\n$$\nR = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{euk}}}{t_{\\mathrm{bact}}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{euk}}^{2}/(2D)}{L_{\\mathrm{bact}}^{2}/(2D)} = \\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{euk}}}{L_{\\mathrm{bact}}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given lengths:\n$$\nR = \\left(\\frac{20.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1.00~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^{2} = (20.0)^{2} = 400\n$$\nUsing the calculated times confirms this result:\n$$\nR = \\frac{20~\\mathrm{s}}{0.05~\\mathrm{s}} = 400\n$$\n\nThe scaling $t \\propto L^{2}$ has a profound biological implication. For a small prokaryotic cell with a diameter of approximately $1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the diffusion time of a protein is on the order of milliseconds ($50~\\mathrm{ms}$), which is sufficiently rapid for most cellular functions. Thus, passive diffusion is an effective mechanism for intracellular transport. However, in a eukaryotic cell that is $20$ times larger in diameter, the diffusion time increases by a factor of $20^{2} = 400$, resulting in a time of $20~\\mathrm{s}$. This timescale is often too slow for processes that require the rapid and targeted delivery of molecular components, such as signaling cascades or metabolic regulation. The inefficiency of diffusion over these larger distances created an evolutionary pressure for the development of active, directed transport systems. Consequently, eukaryotic cells evolved a sophisticated cytoskeleton (microtubules and actin filaments) and associated motor proteins (kinesins, dyneins, myosins) to transport cargo far more quickly and efficiently than diffusion alone could ever permit. This is a fundamental distinction in the organizational strategy of eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{400}\n$$", "id": "2605930"}, {"introduction": "Beyond physical constraints, the genetic organization of eukaryotes introduces additional layers of complexity, such as the presence of non-coding introns within genes that must be removed from messenger RNA before translation.

To assist in its phylogenetic classification, they have sequenced its genomic DNA (gDNA) and identified a gene of interest, which they have named `thermo-α`.

First, they isolate total RNA from the organism and synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from the mature mRNA population. Then, they perform two separate Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) experiments using a single set of primers: one with the organism's gDNA as a template, and the other with the newly synthesized cDNA as a template.\n\nThe forward primer is designed to bind to the sequence starting at position 51 of the gene, and the reverse primer is designed to bind to the complementary strand at a sequence ending at position 2450.\n\nAssuming the bioinformatic prediction is correct and that the `thermo-α` gene is actively transcribed and its pre-mRNA is spliced to remove all introns, calculate the expected sizes of the amplified DNA fragments from both PCR reactions.

The forward primer binds starting at position 51 on the sense strand; the reverse primer binds to the complementary strand with its binding site ending at position 2450. The PCR amplicon spans from the start of the forward primer to the end of the reverse primer, inclusive. Therefore, the length between coordinates $a$ and $b$ inclusive is computed as $b-a+1$.\n\nFor the gDNA template, all exons and introns between positions 51 and 2450 are present.

The cDNA is the concatenation of Exon 1 (length $300$), Exon 2 (length $400$), and Exon 3 (length $500$). The forward primer site at genomic position $51$ lies in Exon 1, so its cDNA coordinate is $51$. The reverse primer site at genomic position $2450$ lies in Exon 3; within Exon 3 its position is $2450-2001+1=450$.

The foundational principles are cornerstones of modern evolutionary cell biology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

It is free from ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The provided information is internally consistent. The absence of cristae, OXPHOS genes, and a mitochondrial genome logically corresponds with the loss of respiration. The presence of ATP importers is a logical consequence of an organelle that performs metabolically expensive tasks (like ISC assembly) but cannot generate its own ATP. The information is sufficient to deduce the answer.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question in evolutionary cell biology. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to identify the single indispensable function that justifies the continued existence of the mitosome, despite its loss of canonical mitochondrial roles. We must reason from the provided evidence and foundational principles.\n\n1.  The mitosome has lost its ability to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. This is explicitly stated by the absence of genes for the TCA cycle and OXPHOS complexes, the lack of cristae (the site of electron transport), and the absence of a mitochondrial genome (which in typical mitochondria encodes key OXPHOS subunits).\n2.  The organelle is not merely a vestigial remnant; it is actively maintained. This is evidenced by the retention of a protein import apparatus (TOM and TIM complexes). The cell expends resources to import nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitosome, implying these proteins perform a vital function within the organelle.\n3.  The mitosome is an energy-dependent organelle. It imports ATP from the cytosol via nucleotide transporters. This energy input must power the essential function for which the organelle is retained.\n4.  The provided list of retained nuclear-encoded genes offers the most direct clue to this function. The genome contains a complete toolkit for Iron-Sulfur Cluster (ISC) biogenesis, and these proteins are localized to the mitosome. Concurrently, the cell maintains the Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur protein Assembly (CIA) pathway.\n5.  A foundational principle states that the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur proteins is a universal and essential process in eukaryotes. These Fe-S proteins are critical for many cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair, and protein translation.\n6.  The standard model of Fe-S protein maturation in eukaryotes involves two stages. The ISC machinery inside the mitochondrion assembles the Fe-S cluster and exports an unknown precursor to the cytosol. The CIA machinery then uses this precursor to deliver the cluster to target apoproteins in the cytosol and nucleus.\n7.  Synthesizing these points leads to a single, parsimonious conclusion: The mitosome is retained because it houses the ISC pathway, which is indispensable for the cell. This pathway's ancestral location is the mitochondrion, and in this lineage, it has not been functionally relocated to the cytosol. Therefore, the cell must maintain the entire organelle, including its import machinery and energy supply, solely to support the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters, which are subsequently required by the essential CIA pathway for the rest of the cell.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. Oxidative phosphorylation and the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle for organelle-local ATP production.**\n  This option is in direct contradiction with the problem statement, which explicitly mentions the absence of genes for OXPHOS and the TCA cycle. The lack of cristae and the presence of ATP importers further falsify this claim.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **B. Iron–sulfur cluster biosynthesis within the mitosome to supply precursors required for the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear iron–sulfur proteins via the Cytosolic Iron–Sulfur protein Assembly pathway.**\n  This option perfectly synthesizes the provided evidence. The presence of the mitosome-localized ISC toolkit and the cytosolic CIA pathway, combined with the foundational principle of the indispensability of Fe-S protein maturation, provides a complete and parsimonious explanation for the retention of the mitosome. All data points support this conclusion.\n  **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **C. Fatty acid $\\beta$-oxidation in the mitosome to provide acetyl coenzyme A for glycolysis-driven ATP production.**\n  This option is flawed on two counts. First, the problem states that genes for canonical fatty acid $\\beta$-oxidation are absent. Second, the biochemical logic is incorrect; acetyl-CoA is a product of $\\beta$-oxidation that can feed into the TCA cycle, it is not a substrate that \"provides for\" glycolysis.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Retention of a mitochondrial genome encoding core respiratory subunits to preserve organelle identity and support minimal respiration.**\n  This option is directly falsified by the problem statement that \"no DNA is detected within these organelles.\" The absence of a mitochondrial genome makes this proposition impossible.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Heme biosynthesis in the mitosome to ensure production of cytochromes for endoplasmic reticulum-associated metabolism.**\n  While heme synthesis is another ancestral mitochondrial function that can be retained in some MROs, the problem provides no evidence for it. In contrast, it provides explicit evidence for the retention of the ISC machinery. Based on the principle of parsimony and the given data, ISC biosynthesis is the documented and supported reason for the organelle's retention, making this option speculative and less likely.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2605891"}]}
