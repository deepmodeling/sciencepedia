This exercise challenges you to apply these fundamental definitions to a detailed, non-trivial scenario involving a prolonged dikaryotic ($n+n$) phase, a common feature in fungi. By carefully parsing the sequence of nuclear events, you can practice distinguishing the essential features that define a life cycle from variations that do not alter its fundamental classification [@problem_id:2561534].", "problem": "A eukaryotic filamentous organism is isolated from soil and cultured axenically. The investigator documents its nuclear cycle with time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry of nuclear DNA content. The following sequence is unambiguous and reproducible in mating-compatible pairings under nutrient-replete conditions.\n\n1) The dominant vegetative thallus is composed of cells whose nuclei each have a haploid complement ($n$). Specialized gametangia arise directly from this thallus, and gametes differentiate by mitotic divisions of $n$ nuclei; there is no reduction division associated with gametogenesis.\n\n2) Upon gamete fusion between compatible mating types, cytoplasmic fusion (plasmogamy) precedes nuclear fusion. The two haploid nuclei coexist and divide synchronously within the same cytoplasm for an extended period, producing a persistent binucleate ($n+n$) dikaryotic mycelium during which ordinary vegetative growth occurs by mitoses of the haploid nuclei. No $2n$ nuclei are observed during this phase.\n\n3) Nuclear fusion (karyogamy) occurs only in a short-lived terminal cell type. Immediately after karyogamy, a single transient diploid nucleus ($2n$) is formed and undergoes a single round of meiosis. The first meiotic division follows directly on karyogamy without any intervening mitosis. After completion of meiosis, $4$ haploid nuclei are partitioned into dispersal spores that germinate to regenerate the haploid vegetative thallus described in step $1$.\n\n4) There is no evidence for any multicellular phase in which the majority of somatic nuclei are $2n$. All mitotic proliferation occurs in either the $n$ or the $n+n$ condition; the $2n$ condition is confined to the brief post-karyogamy, pre-meiotic nucleus, which does not undergo mitosis.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of syngamy (plasmogamy plus karyogamy), meiosis, and the canonical life cycle modes defined by the relative positions of karyogamy and meiosis in the ploidy cycle, identify which type of meiosis this organism exhibits and deduce the corresponding life cycle mode.\n\nChoose the single best option.\n\nA) Gametic meiosis; diplontic life cycle\n\nB) Zygotic meiosis; haplontic life cycle (with a prolonged dikaryotic interlude)\n\nC) Sporic meiosis; haplodiplontic life cycle\n\nD) Zygotic meiosis; diplontic life cycle", "solution": "Foundational definitions and principles:\n\n- Ploidy is the number of complete chromosome sets per nucleus. A haploid nucleus has ploidy $n$; a diploid nucleus has ploidy $2n$.\n\n- Syngamy is the union of gametes and comprises two steps: plasmogamy (cytoplasmic fusion) and karyogamy (nuclear fusion). Only after karyogamy does a $2n$ nucleus exist.\n\n- Meiosis is a reductional division in which a $2n$ nucleus yields haploid ($n$) nuclei after one round of DNA replication and two successive divisions.\n\n- The relative timing of meiosis with respect to syngamy defines three canonical patterns:\n  (i) Zygotic meiosis: karyogamy produces a $2n$ zygotic nucleus that immediately undergoes meiosis; there is no mitotic proliferation of $2n$ cells. This pattern is characteristic of haplontic life cycles, in which the organism’s free-living multicellular phase is haploid and the diploid stage is confined to the zygotic nucleus.\n  (ii) Gametic meiosis: the multicellular phase is $2n$ and meiosis occurs during gametogenesis to produce haploid gametes; there is no multicellular haploid phase. This aligns with diplontic life cycles (typical of animals), where $n$ is confined to gametes.\n  (iii) Sporic meiosis: a multicellular $2n$ sporophyte undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores that grow by mitosis into a multicellular $n$ gametophyte; both $n$ and $2n$ phases have mitotic proliferation. This aligns with haplodiplontic life cycles (alternation of generations in many plants and some algae).\n\nApplication to the described organism:\n\n- From step $1$, gametes arise by mitosis from an $n$ thallus; there is explicitly no reduction division during gametogenesis. This rules out gametic meiosis, which would require meiosis to occur in the $2n$ phase during gamete formation.\n\n- Step $2$ indicates a prolonged $n+n$ dikaryotic phase. Importantly, during this phase there is no $2n$ nucleus; the two $n$ nuclei merely share cytoplasm and divide in synchrony. While this $n+n$ phase is functionally distinctive (as in many fungi), it does not constitute a $2n$ mitotic phase.\n\n- Step $3$ states that karyogamy occurs only in a terminal cell type and is followed immediately by meiosis, with no intervening mitoses of the $2n$ nucleus. The $2n$ condition is therefore transient and confined to the zygotic nucleus before reduction. This is the defining feature of zygotic meiosis.\n\n- Step $4$ confirms there is no multicellular $2n$ phase undergoing mitosis. The multicellular phases with mitosis are $n$ and $n+n$; the latter does not change ploidy. Thus, there is no diplontic dominance, and there is no multicellular $2n$ sporophyte as required for sporic meiosis.\n\nFrom these observations, the organism exhibits zygotic meiosis and, correspondingly, a haplontic life cycle. The prolonged dikaryotic ($n+n$) interlude is a well-known variant in some fungal lineages but does not alter the core classification: the $2n$ nucleus does not proliferate mitotically, and the free-living multicellular condition with mitosis is haploid.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA) Gametic meiosis; diplontic life cycle. Incorrect. Gametic meiosis would require a multicellular $2n$ phase with meiosis during gametogenesis to produce $n$ gametes. Here, gametes are produced by mitosis from an $n$ thallus, and there is no multicellular $2n$ phase.\n\nB) Zygotic meiosis; haplontic life cycle (with a prolonged dikaryotic interlude). Correct. Karyogamy produces a transient $2n$ nucleus that immediately undergoes meiosis (zygotic meiosis), and the free-living, mitotically proliferating phase is haploid, making the life cycle haplontic. The $n+n$ phase is a prolonged pre-karyogamy condition and does not involve $2n$ mitoses.\n\nC) Sporic meiosis; haplodiplontic life cycle. Incorrect. Sporic meiosis requires a multicellular $2n$ sporophyte that undergoes meiosis to produce spores, and a multicellular $n$ gametophyte; both $n$ and $2n$ phases undergo mitosis. The scenario lacks any mitotically proliferating $2n$ phase.\n\nD) Zygotic meiosis; diplontic life cycle. Incorrect. Zygotic meiosis and a diplontic life cycle are incompatible by definition: zygotic meiosis implies no mitotic proliferation of $2n$ cells, whereas a diplontic life cycle requires an extended mitotic $2n$ phase with $n$ restricted to gametes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2561534"}, {"introduction": "In nature, different life cycle stages are not always morphologically distinct, a phenomenon known as isomorphy. This presents a practical challenge: how can we determine the life cycle of an organism if its haploid and diploid forms look identical? This problem asks you to step into the role of an experimental biologist and design a definitive genetic assay, moving beyond simple observation to leverage the power of molecular markers and controlled crosses to reveal the underlying ploidy changes that define an alternation of generations [@problem_id:2561531].", "problem": "A coastal green alga shows morphological isomorphy: blade-like thalli collected from the same site are indistinguishable by gross morphology, yet field ecologists hypothesize that they represent alternate generations in a haplodiplontic life cycle in which a haploid gametophyte of ploidy $n$ alternates with a diploid sporophyte of ploidy $2n$. You are asked to design a genetic marker assay that can reveal alternation of generations despite morphological isomorphy and assign ploidy to each thallus class. Assume that you can culture isolates clonally, induce reproduction under laboratory conditions, and perform controlled crosses.\n\nUse only the following as your fundamental base: (i) by definition, meiosis reduces chromosome number by a factor of $1/2$ and produces haploid products that segregate alleles according to Mendel’s laws (for a single locus with alleles $A$ and $a$ in a diploid $A/a$, meiosis yields a $1:1$ ratio of $A$ to $a$ haploid products); (ii) fertilization (syngamy) fuses two haploid gametes to restore the diploid state $2n$; (iii) codominant nuclear markers resolve individual alleles within a single locus, so a haploid carries exactly one allele per locus while a diploid can carry up to two different alleles at a locus.\n\nYou have access to nuclear markers that are single-copy and polymorphic in the population, and you can genotype any isolate at $k$ loci, where $k \\geq 10$.

Predict that one class of thalli will be strictly monoallelic at every locus with $H_o \\approx 0$, consistent with ploidy $n$, while another class will show $H_o > 0$ at a subset of loci, consistent with ploidy $2n$. Induce putative diploid thalli that are $A/a$ at a locus to undergo meiosis and score the resulting haploid offspring; predict a $1:1$ ratio of $A$ to $a$. Cross haploid $A$ and $a$ thalli; predict diploid $A/a$ zygotes restoring heterozygosity. These results together identify the $n$ and $2n$ phases and demonstrate alternation.\n\nB.

For a diploid locus $A/a$, meiosis yields haploid products $A$ and $a$ in a $1:1$ ratio.\n    - (ii) Fertilization (syngamy) is the fusion of two haploid gametes to form a diploid ($2n$) zygote.\n    - (iii) Codominant nuclear markers reveal individual alleles.

It presents a classic question in phycology and genetics: how to elucidate a life cycle in an isomorphic organism. The provided principles of meiosis, fertilization, and codominant markers are cornerstones of genetics. The experimental capabilities and available tools are standard for modern biological research. The problem is not flawed by any of the listed criteria for invalidity; it is a valid, solvable problem in experimental design.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived by evaluating the options against the provided fundamental principles.\n\nThe central task is twofold: first, to distinguish haploid individuals from diploid individuals, and second, to demonstrate the ordered transition between these ploidy levels as predicted by a haplodiplontic life cycle.\n\nA robust solution must leverage the provided genetic principles.\n1.  **Ploidy Discrimination:** According to principle (iii), a haploid organism ($n$) has a single set of chromosomes and thus can carry only one allele at any given single-copy locus. Its observed heterozygosity ($H_o$) must therefore be identically $0$. A diploid organism ($2n$), having two sets of chromosomes, can be heterozygous (e.g., $A/a$) at any locus for which the population is polymorphic. By screening individuals at multiple polymorphic loci ($k \\geq 10$), diploid individuals are expected to exhibit heterozygosity at some fraction of these loci, resulting in an observed heterozygosity $H_o > 0$. Therefore, a survey of the field population with codominant markers should partition the individuals into two distinct classes: one with $H_o = 0$ (putative haploids) and one with $H_o > 0$ (putative diploids).\n2.  **Demonstration of Alternation:** Simply identifying two ploidy classes is insufficient. One must demonstrate the life cycle transitions.\n    - **Meiosis ($2n \\to n$):** A putative diploid individual, identified by its heterozygosity (e.g., $A/a$) at a specific locus, must be induced to reproduce. In a haplodiplontic cycle, the sporophyte ($2n$) undergoes meiosis to produce spores ($n$). According to principle (i), its progeny (grown from these spores) must be haploid (verifiable as having $H_o=0$) and must show segregation of the parental alleles in a $1:1$ ratio (half the progeny are type $A$, half are type $a$).\n    - **Fertilization ($n + n \\to 2n$):** Two putative haploid individuals, identified by their lack of heterozygosity ($H_o=0$), must be crossed. If they carry different alleles at a locus (e.g., one parent is type $A$, the other is type $a$), their fusion via fertilization (principle (ii)) must produce a diploid ($2n$) zygote. The resulting organism grown from this zygote must be heterozygous ($A/a$) at that locus, thereby restoring the diploid, heterozygous state.\n\nAn experimental design that incorporates all these elements provides the most direct and unambiguous proof of the proposed life cycle.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Develop a panel of $k \\geq 12$ single-copy codominant nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), genotype field thalli and their clonal replicates, and perform controlled matings. Predict that one class of thalli will be strictly monoallelic at every locus with $H_o \\approx 0$, consistent with ploidy $n$, while another class will show $H_o > 0$ at a subset of loci, consistent with ploidy $2n$. Induce putative diploid thalli that are $A/a$ at a locus to undergo meiosis and score the resulting haploid offspring; predict a $1:1$ ratio of $A$ to $a$. Cross haploid $A$ and $a$ thalli; predict diploid $A/a$ zygotes restoring heterozygosity. These results together identify the $n$ and $2n$ phases and demonstrate alternation.**\n\nThis option is a complete and rigorous experimental plan. It correctly uses codominant nuclear markers to distinguish putative ploidy levels based on heterozygosity. Critically, it includes the two essential validation steps: demonstrating Mendelian segregation ($1:1$) from a heterozygous diploid via meiosis, and demonstrating the restoration of heterozygosity through a controlled cross of haploids. This design directly tests every component of the haplodiplontic life cycle according to the provided fundamental principles. The term $H_o \\approx 0$ is a slight imprecision for what should be $H_o = 0$ in a haploid, but in the context of a comprehensive and otherwise correct design, this is a minor point.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Sequence a chloroplast barcode locus from each thallus and infer ploidy from fragment length. Predict that haploids will carry barcode fragments exactly half the length of those in diploids, revealing two classes that correspond to $n$ and $2n$, thus demonstrating alternation.**\n\nThis option is founded on incorrect biological principles. Ploidy refers to the number of sets of *nuclear* chromosomes. The chloroplast genome is an organellar genome and does not become diploid. Furthermore, there is no known biological mechanism whereby the length of a DNA fragment would be halved in a haploid relative to a diploid. Gene dosage changes, but not molecule length. This proposition is scientifically unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Use quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to measure template dosage at single-copy nuclear loci, expecting a cycle threshold shift of $\\Delta C_t \\approx 1$ between haploid and diploid DNA extractions due to a $2$-fold difference in template abundance. Assign ploidy from dosage classes and thereby infer alternation of generations.**\n\nThis method attempts to infer ploidy from the quantity of nuclear DNA. While a $2$-fold difference in single-copy gene template between diploid and haploid cells is expected in principle, and qPCR can detect this ($\\Delta C_t \\approx \\log_2(2) = 1$), this method is indirect and fraught with potential for error. Precise normalization of starting cell counts or tissue mass is difficult, and variations in cell size or DNA extraction efficiency can easily confound the results. More importantly, this experiment, even if successful, only allows for a putative assignment of ploidy. It provides no demonstration of the life cycle processes themselves—meiosis and fertilization. It fails to \"unambiguously reveal alternation of generations.\"\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Genotype dominant Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers and count the presence or absence of bands per individual. Predict that diploids will display approximately twice as many bands as haploids due to having $2$ copies of each locus, allowing ploidy assignment and inference of alternation.**\n\nThis option suffers from two major flaws. First, it proposes using dominant markers (AFLPs). With dominant markers, one cannot distinguish a heterozygote from a dominant homozygote, making a direct calculation of heterozygosity ($H_o$) impossible. This fundamentally limits their power for this task compared to codominant markers. Second, the prediction that diploids will have \"approximately twice as many bands\" is a misunderstanding of how dominant markers work. A diploid will have more bands than a haploid on average (if heterozygous at some loci), but the ratio is not $2:1$. It depends on the number of heterozygous loci. Lastly, like option C, this approach is an indirect and flawed way to infer ploidy and completely fails to test the transitions (meiosis and fertilization) that define the life cycle.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2561531"}, {"introduction": "The structure of an organism's life cycle has profound evolutionary consequences, as natural selection can act differently on haploid and diploid stages.

Random Union of Gametes (Syngamy)**\nThese selected haploid gametes fuse randomly to form diploid zygotes. According to the principle of random union (Hardy-Weinberg proportions), the genotype frequencies of the zygotes will be:\n- Frequency of $AA$ zygotes: $f(AA)_{zygote} = (p_H)^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$ zygotes: $f(Aa)_{zygote} = 2 p_H q_H$\n- Frequency of $aa$ zygotes: $f(aa)_{zygote} = (q_H)^2$\n\n**3.
