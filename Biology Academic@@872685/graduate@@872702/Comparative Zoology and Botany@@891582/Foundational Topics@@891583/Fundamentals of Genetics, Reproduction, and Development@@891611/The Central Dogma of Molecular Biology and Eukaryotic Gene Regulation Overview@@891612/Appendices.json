By analyzing a hypothetical perturbation, you will discover how changes in mRNA stability and translation efficiency can interact, sometimes leading to non-intuitive compensatory outcomes.", "problem": "A comparative zoology and botany lab studies an orthologous gene expressed in a mammalian hepatocyte and an angiosperm leaf mesophyll cell. In both cell types, the gene is constitutively transcribed and translated under steady-state conditions with the following general features of the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is degraded with first-order kinetics, and mRNA is translated into protein, which is also degraded with first-order kinetics (including dilution by growth). Assume that translation initiation is rate-limiting for protein synthesis and that ribosome availability and elongation speeds are not limiting or changing.\n\nLet the transcription initiation rate be $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ (mRNA molecules per unit time per gene), the mRNA degradation rate constant be $\\delta_{m}$ (per unit time), the translation initiation rate per mRNA be $k_{\\mathrm{tl}}$ (proteins initiated per mRNA per unit time), and the protein degradation rate constant be $\\delta_{p}$ (per unit time).

No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is a standard exercise in modeling biochemical reaction networks, specifically the central dogma of molecular biology, using ordinary differential equations under a steady-state assumption. We will now proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nLet $m(t)$ represent the abundance of mRNA molecules and $p(t)$ represent the abundance of protein molecules at time $t$. The problem describes the dynamics with the following assumptions: transcription occurs at a constant rate, while mRNA and protein degradation follow first-order kinetics. Translation is proportional to the amount of mRNA. This system can be described by a set of two coupled ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe rate of change of mRNA abundance is the rate of transcription minus the rate of mRNA degradation:\n$$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} - \\delta_{m} m $$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ is the transcription initiation rate and $\\delta_{m}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant for mRNA.\n\nThe rate of change of protein abundance is the rate of translation minus the rate of protein degradation:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m - \\delta_{p} p $$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{tl}}$ is the translation initiation rate per mRNA molecule and $\\delta_{p}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant for the protein.\n\nWe are asked to find the steady-state abundance of the protein. At steady state, the concentrations of all species are constant, which implies that their time derivatives are zero.\n$$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dp}{dt} = 0 $$\n\nFirst, we solve for the pre-perturbation steady state. Let us denote the initial parameters with the subscript $1$: $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$, $\\delta_{m,1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}$, and $\\delta_{p}$. The steady-state abundances are $m_{ss,1}$ and $p_{ss,1}$.\n\nFrom the mRNA dynamics equation at steady state:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} - \\delta_{m,1} m_{ss,1} $$\nSolving for the steady-state mRNA abundance, $m_{ss,1}$:\n$$ m_{ss,1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}}}{\\delta_{m,1}} $$\n\nNow, using the protein dynamics equation at steady state:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{tl},1} m_{ss,1} - \\delta_{p} p_{ss,1} $$\nSolving for the steady-state protein abundance, $p_{ss,1}$, and substituting the expression for $m_{ss,1}$:\n$$ p_{ss,1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl},1} m_{ss,1}}{\\delta_{p}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{p}} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}}}{\\delta_{m,1}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}} $$\nThis is the expression for the protein abundance before the perturbation.\n\nNext, we analyze the system after the regulatory perturbation. Let the new parameters be denoted with a subscript $2$. The problem states:\n$1$. The transcription rate $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ is constant, so $k_{\\mathrm{tx},2} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$.\n$2$. The protein degradation rate $\\delta_{p}$ is constant, so $\\delta_{p,2} = \\delta_{p}$.\n$3$. The translation initiation rate is halved, so $k_{\\mathrm{tl},2} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{2}$.\n$4$. The mRNA half-life is doubled. The initial half-life is $\\tau_{m,1} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,1}}$. The new half-life is $\\tau_{m,2} = 2\\tau_{m,1}$.\n\nWe must find the new mRNA degradation rate constant, $\\delta_{m,2}$, from the new half-life:\n$$ \\tau_{m,2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,2}} $$\nSubstituting the relation $\\tau_{m,2} = 2\\tau_{m,1}$:\n$$ 2\\tau_{m,1} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,2}} $$\n$$ 2 \\left( \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,1}} \\right) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{2}{\\delta_{m,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\delta_{m,2}} $$\n$$ \\delta_{m,2} = \\frac{\\delta_{m,1}}{2} $$\nThus, doubling the mRNA half-life corresponds to halving its degradation rate constant.\n\nNow, we solve for the post-perturbation steady-state protein abundance, $p_{ss,2}$. The form of the steady-state solution is the same, but with the new parameters:\n$$ p_{ss,2} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx},2} k_{\\mathrm{tl},2}}{\\delta_{m,2} \\delta_{p,2}} $$\nSubstituting the post-perturbation parameter values:\n$$ p_{ss,2} = \\frac{(k_{\\mathrm{tx}}) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{2} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\delta_{m,1}}{2} \\right) (\\delta_{p})} $$\nThe factors of $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n$$ p_{ss,2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}} $$\nComparing this result to the pre-perturbation abundance, we find:\n$$ p_{ss,2} = p_{ss,1} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in steady-state protein output, which is defined as the ratio $\\frac{p_{ss,2}}{p_{ss,1}}$.\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{p_{ss,2}}{p_{ss,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}}}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}}} $$\nSince the numerator and the denominator are identical, their ratio is $1$. The halving of the translation rate per mRNA molecule is perfectly compensated by the doubling of the steady-state mRNA abundance, which results from the halving of the mRNA degradation rate. Therefore, the total rate of protein synthesis remains unchanged, and because the protein degradation rate is also constant, the steady-state protein abundance does not change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2616411"}, {"introduction": "Gene expression is rarely constant; it is precisely regulated in response to internal and external signals, often exhibiting switch-like, all-or-none behavior.

In both systems, a single transcription factor (TF) is titrated, and a fluorescent reporter controlled by the respective regulatory element is measured. Assume the following fundamental base: according to the central dogma, regulation of transcription modulates the rate of messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) synthesis, and under quasi-equilibrium conditions of TF binding at the regulatory element, the mean transcriptional output is proportional to the probability that the regulatory element is in a TF-bound transcriptionally competent state. Further assume a standard equilibrium occupancy model with cooperative homotropic binding to equivalent DNA sites that can be summarized by a single effective cooperativity parameter, without providing the explicit functional form.\n\nFor each regulatory element, the reporter signal has been background-subtracted and normalized by the empirically determined saturating value at very high TF concentration, so the reported activity is a dimensionless fraction in the closed interval $[0, 1]$. The TF concentration is reported in nanomolar. The following quantitative observations were obtained:\n\nArthropod enhancer (animal):\n- At TF concentration $C = 50~\\mathrm{nM}$, the normalized reporter activity is $0.5$.\n- At TF concentration $C = 100~\\mathrm{nM}$, the normalized reporter activity is $0.8$.\n\nPlant regulatory element (plant):\n- At TF concentration $C = 100~\\mathrm{nM}$, the normalized reporter activity is $0.5$.\n- At TF concentration $C = 200~\\mathrm{nM}$, the normalized reporter activity is $\\dfrac{2}{3}$.\n\nStarting from the equilibrium occupancy reasoning and the definition of the Hill-type effective description implied by cooperative binding, fit an appropriate Hill function separately to each dataset to infer, for each regulatory element, the effective cooperativity (Hill coefficient) $n$ and the effective threshold concentration $K$ (the concentration at which half-maximal activity is achieved).

The normalized activity $A$ is given by:\n$$A(C) = \\frac{C^n}{K^n + C^n}$$\nIn this equation, $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which quantifies the degree of cooperativity in the binding process. $K$ is the effective threshold concentration, defined as the concentration of the transcription factor at which the activity is half of its maximal value. Since the activity is normalized to a maximum of $1$, $K$ is the concentration where $A = 0.5$.\n\nWe will now analyze each system separately to determine the parameters $K$ and $n$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the arthropod enhancer.

A is negative, so $\\lambda_1 = -1 - |A|$, which is always negative. $\\lambda_2 = -1 - A = -1 + |A|$. Ah, the original text has it as $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ in a different order. Let me fix my scratchpad. Let's call them $\\lambda_+$ and $\\lambda_-$. $\\lambda = -1 \\pm A$. Since A is negative, let $A = -|A|$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda = -1 \\pm (-|A|) = -1 - |A|$ and $-1 + |A|$. The first one is always negative. The second one, $-1 + |A|$, can become positive. The fixed point becomes unstable when $-1 + |A| \\ge 0$.\nSo the instability happens when $\\lambda_2$ in the solution (I'll call it $\\lambda_+$) becomes $\\ge 0$.\n$\\lambda_+ = -1 - \\left(-\\frac{n(x^*)^n}{1+(x^*)^n}\\right) = -1 + \\frac{n(x^*)^n}{1+(x^*)^n}$.\nThe fixed point is stable if $\\lambda_+ < 0$. It loses stability when $\\lambda_+ \\ge 0$. The onset of bistability corresponds to a pitchfork bifurcation, which occurs precisely when the symmetric fixed point becomes unstable. The critical condition is $\\lambda_+=0$.\n$$ -1 + \\frac{n(x^*)^n}{1+(x^*)^n} = 0 \\implies n(x^*)^n = 1+(x^*)^n $$\n$$ (n-1)(x^*)^n = 1 $$\nThis gives the value of $x^*$ at the bifurcation point, which we denote as $x^*_c$:\n$$ (x^*_c)^n = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\implies x^*_c = \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} $$\nThis result is only meaningful for $n>1$. For $n=1$, no such finite $x^*_c$ exists, implying the system is always monostable, a known result.\nNow, we find the critical value of the synthesis parameter, $\\alpha_c$, by substituting $x^*_c$ back into the steady-state equation $\\alpha = x^*(1+(x^*)^n)$:\n$$ \\alpha_c = x^*_c \\left(1 + (x^*_c)^n\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n-1}\\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\left(\\frac{n-1+1}{n-1}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\left(\\frac{n}{n-1}\\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1} (n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}} = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1+\\frac{1}{n}}} $$\nSimplifying the exponent gives the final expression for the minimal dimensionless synthesis parameter $\\alpha$ at which bistability appears.\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{\\frac{n+1}{n}}} $$\nThe logic in the solution is sound, but it labels the eigenvalues differently. The crucial one is $-1+|A|$, which it calls $\\lambda_2$. This is a cosmetic difference. The derivation is correct. So I'll keep the solution as is.\nThe removal of `($2$)` is a good call for clarity.\nFinal check on the solution text. The derivation is perfect. The text is clear.
