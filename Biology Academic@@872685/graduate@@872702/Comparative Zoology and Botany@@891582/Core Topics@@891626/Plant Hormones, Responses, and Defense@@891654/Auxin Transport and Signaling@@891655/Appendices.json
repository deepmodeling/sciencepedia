Our mass-balance solution shows the opposite under $\\alpha \\ll 1$ with $\\delta < 1$: $N_{\\mathrm{PM}}$ decreases despite slowed sorting because recycling is the dominant return route to the surface. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option C: Predicts inversion of polarity to the apical surface with little change in total surface abundance and reversal of flux direction. The model does not include apical relocalization; experimentally, BFA primarily causes endosomal trapping and plasma membrane depletion rather than polarity inversion on this time scale.
