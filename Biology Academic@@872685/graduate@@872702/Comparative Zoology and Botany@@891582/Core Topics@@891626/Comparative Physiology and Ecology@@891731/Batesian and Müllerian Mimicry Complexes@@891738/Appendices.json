Alkaloids are the dominant deterrent mediating unprofitability.\n    2. The shared color pattern is the primary cue used by predators.\n    3. The chemical assay captures the relevant deterrent class for this system.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic scenario in evolutionary ecology concerning chemical defense and mimicry. The concepts of Batesian and Müllerian mimicry, aposematism, alkaloids as chemical defenses, and predator learning are all fundamental principles in this field. The numerical values provided are biologically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient data (alkaloid concentrations, attack probabilities) and explicit assumptions to allow for a logical deduction of the mimicry system in place. The question asks for the \"most consistent\" interpretation, which is appropriate for a problem in biology.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and devoid of subjectivity.\n\nThe problem statement exhibits no flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or otherwise invalid. It presents a clear, formalizable question based on standard ecological principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe theoretical framework for this problem rests upon the definitions of aposematism and mimicry. Aposematism is the association of a warning signal (here, the conspicuous color pattern) with a defense that makes the organism unprofitable to a predator (here, alkaloids). Mimicry involves the convergence of signals among different species or morphs.\n\n1.  **Characterize Morph $X$:** This morph possesses a mean alkaloid concentration of $5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$. According to the provided assumptions, alkaloids are the dominant deterrent, making morph $X$ unprofitable to predators. It displays a conspicuous color pattern and experiences a low attack probability of $0.10$. This combination of a warning signal, unprofitability, and learned avoidance by predators defines morph $X$ as an aposematic **model**.\n\n2.  **Characterize Morph $Y$:** This morph has an alkaloid concentration of $0\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$. Based on the assumption that alkaloids are the primary defense and the assay is comprehensive, morph $Y$ is undefended and therefore **palatable**. It shares the same warning signal as morph $X$ but suffers a much higher attack probability of $0.50$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Mimicry System:** The system involves a palatable organism (morph $Y$) that has evolved to share the warning signal of an unprofitable, aposematic organism (morph $X$). This is the precise definition of **Batesian mimicry**. In this parasitic relationship, the mimic ($Y$) benefits from the predator's learned aversion to the model ($X$), while the model is potentially harmed because encounters with the palatable mimic can dilute or retard the learning process. The significant disparity in attack probabilities ($0.10$ for the model, $0.50$ for the mimic) is a classic signature of a Batesian system, especially when mimics are not rare (as implied by \"similar frequencies\"), because predators are more likely to attack and consume the palatable mimics, thereby weakening the signal's protective value for all bearers.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Batesian mimicry: morph $X$ is an unprofitable model and morph $Y$ is a palatable mimic; predator learning reduces attacks on $X$ to $0.10$ while $Y$ suffers higher attacks near $0.50$, especially when mimics are not rare.**\nThis statement correctly identifies morph $X$ as the unprofitable model and morph $Y$ as the palatable mimic, based on their respective alkaloid concentrations of $5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$ and $0\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$. It accurately describes the dynamic where the model is well-protected ($0.10$ attack rate) while the mimic is attacked more frequently ($0.50$ attack rate). The reference to mimic frequency (\"especially when mimics are not rare\") correctly reflects a key principle of Batesian mimicry dynamics, which is consistent with the experimental condition of \"similar frequencies.\" This interpretation aligns perfectly with the data and established theory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Müllerian mimicry: both morphs are unprofitable co-mimics; the observed difference between $0.10$ and $0.50$ is expected because more toxic co-mimics always have lower attack rates than less toxic co-mimics.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Müllerian mimicry requires that *all* participating members be unprofitable. Morph $Y$ has an alkaloid concentration of $0\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$ and is therefore palatable, not unprofitable. The premise of this option is factually incorrect based on the problem's data. Therefore, the system cannot be one of Müllerian mimicry.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No mimicry: the color pattern is not functioning as a warning signal; the attack-rate disparity between $0.10$ and $0.50$ is better explained by unmeasured habitat-use differences and alkaloid concentration is irrelevant.**\nThis option directly violates the explicit assumptions of the problem. The problem states that \"the shared color pattern is the primary cue used by predators\" and \"alkaloids are the dominant deterrent.\" This option dismisses both, claiming the pattern is not a warning signal and the alkaloids are irrelevant. It invokes speculative, \"unmeasured\" factors, which is an invalid approach when the problem provides a self-contained set of conditions. The extremely low attack rate ($0.10$) on the defended morph $X$ is strong evidence that the color pattern *is* functioning as an effective warning signal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Müllerian complex with quasi-Batesian dynamics: morph $Y$ is weakly defended and thus still a co-mimic; large attack-rate differences such as $0.10$ versus $0.50$ are typical outcomes even when one co-mimic has $0\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$ alkaloids.**\nThis option is a mischaracterization. The concept of a \"quasi-Batesian\" dynamic applies to the spectrum of unprofitability within a Müllerian complex, where a less-defended co-mimic acts parasitically on a more-defended one. However, this still requires the mimic to be, at minimum, \"weakly defended\" or unprofitable to some degree. The data show morph $Y$ has an alkaloid concentration of $0\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$. Given the problem's assumptions, this signifies a complete lack of the relevant defense, rendering morph $Y$ palatable, not weakly defended. A palatable organism is a Batesian mimic, not a Müllerian co-mimic. The assertion that a co-mimic can have $0\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$ defense is a contradiction in terms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2549469"}, {"introduction": "Warning signals are only effective if predators can learn to associate them with unprofitability.

The constraint that $p(t)$ must remain in $[0,1]$ is naturally satisfied by the structure of the replicator equation, and a robust numerical solver will respect these boundaries.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the replicator dynamics for Batesian mimicry and evaluates invasion success.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Fixed parameters for all simulations ---\n    p0 = 0.01          # Initial mimic frequency\n    p_thr = 0.10       # Invasion success threshold\n    T_horizon = 500.0  # Simulation time horizon\n    b_m = 1.0          # Baseline fecundity of mimic\n    b_M = 1.0          # Baseline fecundity of model\n\n    # --- Test suite of parameter sets ---\n    # Each tuple is (A0, k, c_pred_m, rho, c_def, c_morph)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.8, 3.0, 0.8, 0.1, 0.12, 0.01),    # Test 1\n        (0.8, 0.0, 0.6, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01),    # Test 2\n        (0.8, 3.0, 0.8, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02133), # Test 3\n        (0.8, 3.0, 0.8, 0.1, 0.12, 0.20),    # Test 4\n        (1.0, 6.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.20, 0.00),    # Test 5\n    ]\n\n    def replicator_rhs(t, p, A0, k, c_pred_m, rho, c_def, c_morph):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the right-hand side of the replicator ODE: dp/dt.\n        \n        Args:\n            t (float): Time variable (unused, for compatibility with solve_ivp).\n            p (list or np.ndarray): State variable, p[0] is the mimic frequency.\n            A0 (float): Baseline attack probability.\n            k (float): Predator learning rate.\n            c_pred_m (float): Per-attack fitness loss for the mimic.\n            rho (float): Reduction factor for model's predation cost.\n            c_def (float): Cost of defense for the model.\n            c_morph (float): Cost of resemblance for the mimic.\n            \n        Returns:\n            list: The derivative [dp/dt].\n        \"\"\"\n        p_val = p[0]\n\n        # The p(1-p) term naturally enforces the [0,1] boundary, but as a\n        # safeguard for numerical stability, we can explicitly return 0 at the boundaries.\n        if not (0  p_val  1):\n            return [0.0]\n\n        # Fraction of defended signalers (models)\n        f_def = 1.0 - p_val\n        \n        # Predator's attack probability\n        attack_prob = A0 * np.exp(-k * f_def)\n        \n        # Malthusian fitness of mimic and model\n        W_m = b_m - c_morph - c_pred_m * attack_prob\n        W_M = b_M - c_def - rho * c_pred_m * attack_prob\n        \n        # Replicator equation: dp/dt = p(1-p)(W_m - W_M)\n        dpdt = p_val * (1.0 - p_val) * (W_m - W_M)\n        \n        return [dpdt]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case_params in test_cases:\n        # Solve the ODE for the current parameter set\n        solution = solve_ivp(\n            fun=replicator_rhs,\n            t_span=(0, T_horizon),\n            y0=[p0],\n            method='RK45',\n            args=case_params,\n            dense_output=False # We only need the max value from the returned points\n        )\n        \n        # Determine if invasion was successful\n        if solution.status == 0:  # Check if integration was successful\n            max_p = np.max(solution.y[0])\n            invasion_success = max_p = p_thr\n        else:\n            # If solver fails, assume invasion fails for this case\n            invasion_success = False\n\n        results.append(invasion_success)\n        \n    # Format and print the final output exactly as required\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2549335"}]}
