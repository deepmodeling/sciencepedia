The provided physiological parameters are plausible for a freshwater vertebrate. The problem is well-posed, containing all necessary information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, precise language. There are no contradictions or logical flaws. The unit analysis confirms consistency after appropriate conversion. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the renal handling of any substance is the conservation of mass. The rate of excretion of a substance is equal to the rate at which it is filtered, plus the rate at which it is secreted, minus the rate at which it is reabsorbed. Let $E_x$ be the excretion rate of a substance $x$, $L_{\\text{filt}, x}$ be its filtered load, $S_x$ be its secretion rate, and $R_x$ be its reabsorption rate. All quantities are expressed per unit body mass. The mass balance equation is:\n$$E_x = L_{\\text{filt}, x} - R_x + S_x$$\nFor sodium ions ($\\mathrm{Na}^+$), the problem provides information on filtration and reabsorption. It makes no mention of tubular secretion, so we correctly assume it is negligible, a standard assumption for sodium handling in this context. Thus, $S_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} \\approx 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = L_{\\text{filt}, \\mathrm{Na}^+} - R_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$$\nWe must now define each term on the right-hand side.\n\nThe filtered load of sodium, $L_{\\text{filt}, \\mathrm{Na}^+}$, is the mass of sodium filtered from the plasma into the Bowman's capsule per unit time, per unit body mass. It is calculated as the product of the glomerular filtration rate ($\\text{GFR}$), the plasma concentration of sodium ($[\\mathrm{Na}^+]_p$), and the glomerular sieving coefficient ($S_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$), which accounts for the filterability of the substance.\n$$L_{\\text{filt}, \\mathrm{Na}^+} = \\text{GFR} \\times [\\mathrm{Na}^+]_p \\times S_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$$\nThe problem states that sodium is freely filterable, meaning its concentration in the glomerular ultrafiltrate is the same as in plasma water. This corresponds to a sieving coefficient $S_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = 1$.\n\nThe rate of tubular reabsorption of sodium, $R_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$, represents the mass of sodium transported back into the blood from the tubular fluid per unit time, per unit body mass. The problem states that the fraction of the filtered sodium load that is reabsorbed is $F_R$. Therefore, the reabsorption rate is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = F_R \\times L_{\\text{filt}, \\mathrm{Na}^+} = F_R \\times (\\text{GFR} \\times [\\mathrm{Na}^+]_p \\times S_{\\mathrm{Na}^+})$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $L_{\\text{filt}, \\mathrm{Na}^+}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$ into the mass balance equation gives the expression for the excretion rate, $E_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = (\\text{GFR} \\times [\\mathrm{Na}^+]_p \\times S_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}) - (F_R \\times \\text{GFR} \\times [\\mathrm{Na}^+]_p \\times S_{\\mathrm{Na}^+})$$\nFactoring out the common terms, we arrive at the final derived expression for the sodium excretion rate per unit body mass:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = (1 - F_R) \\times \\text{GFR} \\times [\\mathrm{Na}^+]_p \\times S_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$$\nThis equation correctly represents that the excreted amount is the fraction of the filtered load that is *not* reabsorbed.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.
