In the outer medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL), transepithelial sodium chloride reabsorption is mediated predominantly by the apical Sodium-Potassium-2-Chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) with stoichiometry $1\\,\\mathrm{Na}^{+}\\!:\\!1\\,\\mathrm{K}^{+}\\!:\\!2\\,\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and is supported by the apical Renal Outer Medullary Potassium channel (ROMK), which recycles potassium into the lumen and contributes to a lumen-positive transepithelial voltage that drives paracellular cation flux. The TAL is effectively water-impermeable, so salt reabsorption elevates interstitial osmolality without diluting it, enabling countercurrent multiplication. The inner medullary collecting duct equilibrates water with the surrounding interstitium in the presence of ADH. Consider two selective interventions limited to the TAL: (i) a potent ROMK inhibitor that reduces ROMK conductance by approximately $90\\%$ without altering NKCC2 protein abundance or basolateral exit pathways, and (ii) a potent NKCC2 inhibitor that reduces NKCC2 turnover by approximately $90\\%$ without directly affecting ROMK. Assume, for the time scale of the experiment, that urea handling, medullary blood flow, and collecting-duct water permeability are unchanged by either intervention, and that luminal potassium concentration remains finite due to delivery from upstream segments and possible minor alternative apical potassium pathways. Using only core principles—mass conservation, osmosis, epithelial permeability, and transporter coupling—predict how each intervention changes the steady-state corticomedullary interstitial osmolality and the maximal urine osmolality, and identify which intervention produces the larger decrement. Which option best captures the correct qualitative comparison and the mechanistic justification?\n\nA. Both interventions reduce interstitial osmolality and maximal urine osmolality, but NKCC2 inhibition causes a larger fall because it directly abrogates the main transcellular sodium chloride entry that generates the TAL “single effect,” whereas ROMK inhibition limits NKCC2 indirectly by reducing luminal potassium availability and the lumen-positive voltage, leaving some residual NKCC2-mediated and paracellular sodium chloride reabsorption.\n\nB. Both interventions reduce interstitial osmolality and maximal urine osmolality, but ROMK inhibition causes a larger fall because NKCC2 function is completely dependent on ROMK; without ROMK there is no luminal potassium, NKCC2 flux falls to zero everywhere, and there is no alternative pathway to sustain sodium chloride reabsorption.\n\nC. NKCC2 inhibition lowers interstitial osmolality and maximal urine osmolality, but ROMK inhibition does not change interstitial osmolality because it only affects divalent cation handling via the lumen-positive voltage and leaves sodium chloride reabsorption intact.\n\nD. Neither intervention changes interstitial osmolality because the water-impermeable TAL determines dilution, whereas medullary interstitial osmolality is determined solely by urea; therefore, maximal urine osmolality is unchanged.", "solution": "Begin with core definitions and laws. The TAL generates the corticomedullary sodium chloride gradient via active transcellular salt transport while remaining water-impermeable. This creates a local interstitial–tubular “single effect,” whose repetition along opposing limbs and the vasa recta yields a corticomedullary interstitial osmolality gradient by countercurrent multiplication. In the presence of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), the collecting duct permeability to water is high, so maximal urine osmolality approaches the interstitial osmolality at the papillary tip. Thus, any reduction in the TAL single effect that lowers medullary interstitial sodium chloride will reduce both interstitial osmolality and maximal urine osmolality.\n\nThe dominant apical entry pathway for sodium chloride in the outer medullary TAL is NKCC2 with stoichiometry $1\\,\\mathrm{Na}^{+}\\!:\\!1\\,\\mathrm{K}^{+}\\!:\\!2\\,\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. This cotransporter requires luminal potassium to cycle. Because luminal potassium delivery can be limiting, the apical potassium conductance through ROMK recycles intracellular potassium back into the lumen, maintaining a sufficient luminal potassium concentration for continued NKCC2 turnover. ROMK-mediated potassium recycling, together with basolateral chloride exit, contributes to a lumen-positive transepithelial voltage that drives paracellular cation reabsorption, including sodium. Therefore, NKCC2 and ROMK are functionally coupled: NKCC2 mediates transcellular sodium chloride uptake directly, and ROMK sustains NKCC2 flux and supports the paracellular component by setting the voltage.\n\nConsider the two selective interventions:\n\n1. NKCC2 inhibition by approximately $90\\%$: This directly reduces the primary transcellular sodium chloride flux that establishes the single effect. With NKCC2 turnover reduced, both transcellular sodium chloride reabsorption and the generation of the lumen-positive voltage decline, decreasing paracellular cation reabsorption. The net effect is a marked reduction in outer medullary sodium chloride accumulation. Because the TAL is water-impermeable, this directly shrinks the corticomedullary interstitial osmolality gradient. With ADH unchanged, maximal urine osmolality falls in proportion to the reduced interstitial osmolality.\n\n2. ROMK inhibition by approximately $90\\%$: This limits potassium recycling into the lumen, thereby lowering luminal potassium and attenuating NKCC2 activity indirectly via substrate limitation and altered apical membrane potential. ROMK inhibition also diminishes the lumen-positive voltage, impairing paracellular cation reabsorption. However, the premise specifies that luminal potassium remains finite due to upstream delivery and possible minor alternative apical potassium pathways, so NKCC2 flux does not fall to zero; rather, it persists at a reduced level. Consequently, the TAL single effect decreases but is not abolished, and the corticomedullary interstitial gradient and maximal urine osmolality both decline, albeit less than with direct NKCC2 inhibition.\n\nThus, both interventions reduce interstitial osmolality and the ability to produce hyperosmotic urine, with a larger decrement expected for direct NKCC2 inhibition because it removes the principal transcellular sodium chloride transport step regardless of luminal potassium availability, whereas ROMK inhibition reduces that step indirectly and incompletely.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option states that both interventions reduce interstitial and urine osmolality, and that NKCC2 inhibition produces a larger fall because it directly disables the main transcellular sodium chloride entry (“single effect”) while ROMK inhibition compromises it indirectly by limiting luminal potassium and voltage, leaving residual NKCC2 and paracellular flux. This aligns with transporter coupling: NKCC2 is the central mover; ROMK sustains NKCC2 but is not the sole source of luminal potassium. With finite luminal potassium remaining, NKCC2 flux persists at a reduced rate. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This option claims ROMK inhibition is larger in effect because NKCC2 is completely dependent on ROMK and there is no alternative pathway. This overstates the dependence: while ROMK is important, luminal potassium does not fall to zero, and other apical potassium pathways and upstream delivery sustain some NKCC2 turnover. Moreover, even if ROMK inhibition markedly reduces voltage, some transcellular and paracellular sodium chloride transport persists. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option asserts ROMK inhibition does not change interstitial osmolality and only affects divalent cations. In fact, ROMK inhibition reduces NKCC2 activity by limiting luminal potassium and reduces the lumen-positive voltage that drives paracellular sodium; both effects decrease sodium chloride reabsorption, lowering interstitial osmolality. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option claims neither intervention changes interstitial osmolality because urea solely determines it. In mammals, both sodium chloride (from TAL) and urea (from inner medullary collecting duct) contribute substantially to interstitial osmolality. Reducing TAL sodium chloride reabsorption lowers the sodium chloride component of the gradient and, acutely, maximal urine osmolality.

The cortical interstitium is isosmotic with plasma at $C_{\\mathrm{cortex}}$, and urea recycling and vasa recta washout are negligible.

The system is described as a series of $N$ discrete axial steps. Let $i$ be the index for each step, from $i=1$ at the corticomedullary junction to $i=N$ at the papilla. The interstitium at the cortex (level $i=0$) has an osmolality of $C_{\\mathrm{cortex}}$. Let $C_I(i)$ be the interstitial osmolality at step $i$.\n\nThe problem states that the descending limb is highly water-permeable and equilibrates with the local interstitium. Therefore, the fluid in the descending limb at step $i$, denoted $C_D(i)$, has an osmolality equal to that of the local interstitium:\n$$ C_D(i) = C_I(i) $$\nThe ascending limb actively transports salt out, creating a uniform transverse osmolality difference, the \"single effect\" $\\Delta C$, between its fluid and the interstitium. The ascending limb fluid is thus hyposmotic relative to the interstitium. Let $C_A(i)$ be the osmolality of the fluid in the ascending limb at step $i$. The relationship is:\n$$ C_I(i) = C_A(i) + \\Delta C $$\nCombining these two relations gives:\n$$ C_D(i) = C_A(i) + \\Delta C $$\nThe countercurrent multiplication mechanism amplifies this single effect along the axis of the medulla. In the simplest, standard discrete model of this process, the increase in interstitial osmolality from one step to the next, $C_I(i) - C_I(i-1)$, is equal to the single effect, $\\Delta C$. This creates an arithmetic progression for the interstitial osmolality along the medulla.\nThe interstitial osmolality at step $i$ can be expressed as:\n$$ C_I(i) = C_I(0) + i \\cdot \\Delta C $$\nwhere $C_I(0) = C_{\\mathrm{cortex}}$.\nThe maximum osmolality occurs at the deepest point of the medulla, the papilla, which corresponds to step $N$. The problem states that the maximal urine osmolality, $U_{\\max}$, equals the papillary interstitium osmolality, which is $C_I(N)$.\nTherefore, the expression for maximal urine osmolality is:\n$$ U_{\\max} = C_{\\mathrm{cortex}} + N \\cdot \\Delta C $$\n\nNext, we analyze the conditions before and after the administration of the loop diuretic.\n\nState 1: Before diuretic administration (baseline).\nThe single effect is given as $\\Delta C_0 = 120\\,\\mathrm{mOsm\\,kg^{-1}}$.\nThe maximal urine osmolality before the diuretic is:\n$$ U_{\\max}^{(\\mathrm{before})} = C_{\\mathrm{cortex}} + N \\cdot \\Delta C_0 $$\n\nState 2: After diuretic administration.\nThe diuretic reduces the activity of the NKCC2 transporter by $80\\%$.

A reduction of $80\\%$ means the new activity is $100\\% - 80\\% = 20\\%$ of the baseline activity.\nThe new single effect, $\\Delta C'$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta C' = (1 - 0.80) \\cdot \\Delta C_0 = 0.20 \\cdot \\Delta C_0 $$\nThe maximal urine osmolality after the diuretic is:\n$$ U_{\\max}^{(\\mathrm{after})} = C_{\\mathrm{cortex}} + N \\cdot \\Delta C' = C_{\\mathrm{cortex}} + N \\cdot (0.20 \\cdot \\Delta C_0) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the change in maximal urine osmolality, defined as $\\Delta U_{\\max} = U_{\\max}^{(\\mathrm{after})} - U_{\\max}^{(\\mathrm{before})}$.\nWe can now derive the expression for this change:\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = (C_{\\mathrm{cortex}} + 0.20 \\cdot N \\cdot \\Delta C_0) - (C_{\\mathrm{cortex}} + N \\cdot \\Delta C_0) $$\nThe term $C_{\\mathrm{cortex}}$ cancels out:\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = 0.20 \\cdot N \\cdot \\Delta C_0 - N \\cdot \\Delta C_0 $$\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = (0.20 - 1) \\cdot N \\cdot \\Delta C_0 $$\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = -0.80 \\cdot N \\cdot \\Delta C_0 $$\nThis is the derived expression for the change in maximal urine osmolality.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value using the given parameters: $N = 12$ and $\\Delta C_0 = 120\\,\\mathrm{mOsm\\,kg^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = -0.80 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 120 $$\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = -0.80 \\cdot 1440 $$\n$$ \\Delta U_{\\max} = -1152\\,\\mathrm{mOsm\\,kg^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nRounding $-1152$ to three significant figures gives $-1150$.\n\nThe change in maximal urine osmolality is $-1150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm\\,kg^{-1}}$.
