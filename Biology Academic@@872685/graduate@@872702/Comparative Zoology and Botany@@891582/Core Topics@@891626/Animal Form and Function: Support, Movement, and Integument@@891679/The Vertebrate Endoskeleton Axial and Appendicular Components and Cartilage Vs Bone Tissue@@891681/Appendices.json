We will first derive the necessary relationships from the principles of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Stress and Strain Expressions**\nFor a simply supported rectangular beam of span $L$, width $b$, and depth $d$, subjected to a central point load $F$, the maximum bending moment $M$ occurs at the midspan and is given by:\n$$\nM = \\frac{F L}{4}\n$$\nThe second moment of area, $I$, for the rectangular cross-section is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{b d^3}{12}\n$$\nThe normal stress $\\sigma$ due to bending is given by the flexure formula, $\\sigma = \\frac{My}{I}$, where $y$ is the distance from the neutral axis. The maximum stress occurs at the outer fibers, where $y = \\pm d/2$. We are concerned with the magnitude, so we take $y = d/2$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{M (d/2)}{I} = \\frac{(FL/4)(d/2)}{bd^3/12}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the formula for the outer-fiber stress at midspan:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{FLd}{8} \\cdot \\frac{12}{bd^3} = \\frac{3FL}{2bd^2}\n$$\nThis equation converts the applied load $F$ into the corresponding outer-fiber stress $\\sigma$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the outer-fiber strain $\\varepsilon$. The strain at the outer fiber is $\\varepsilon = \\frac{y}{\\rho} = \\frac{d/2}{\\rho}$, where $\\rho$ is the radius of curvature. Within the framework of linear elastic beam theory, the maximum deflection $\\delta$ at the midspan is given by:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{FL^3}{48EI}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus. Also from beam theory, we know that $\\frac{1}{\\rho} = \\frac{M}{EI}$.

At steady state, $\\frac{dB}{dt} = 0$, which implies a balance between bone formation and resorption:\n$$\nf(S, B^\\ast, \\varphi) = g(O, B^\\ast)\n$$\nSubstituting the provided constitutive relations for the formation rate $f(S,B,\\varphi)$ and resorption rate $g(O,B)$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S)\\,(1-B^\\ast) = k_{\\text{resorb}}\\,O\\,B^\\ast\n$$\nHere, $k_{\\text{form}}$ and $k_{\\text{resorb}}$ are rate constants, and $F(S)$ is the mechanosensory response function. To find the steady-state bone volume fraction $B^\\ast$, we must solve this algebraic equation for $B^\\ast$. Expanding the left side yields:\n$$\nk_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S) - k_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S)\\,B^\\ast = k_{\\text{resorb}}\\,O\\,B^\\ast\n$$\nWe collect all terms containing $B^\\ast$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\nk_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S) = B^\\ast \\left( k_{\\text{resorb}}\\,O + k_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S) \\right)\n$$\nIsolating $B^\\ast$ gives the general expression for the steady-state BV/TV:\n$$\nB^\\ast = \\frac{k_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S)}{k_{\\text{resorb}}\\,O + k_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S)}\n$$\nThis can be expressed more compactly by dividing the numerator and denominator by $k_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S)$:\n$$\nB^\\ast = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{k_{\\text{resorb}}\\,O}{k_{\\text{form}}\\,(1-\\varphi)\\,F(S)}}\n$$\nThis derived formula is the cornerstone of the solution. It is a function of the input variables $S$, $O$, and $\\varphi$, and the model parameters. The mechanosensory response $F(S)$ is given by the sigmoid function:\n$$\nF(S) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{S - S_{\\text{set}}}{s_{\\text{slope}}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe computational procedure involves applying this formula to each compartment and test case, using the specified parameters.\n\nThe parameters are:\n- $k_{\\text{form}} = 0.04$\n- $k_{\\text{resorb}} = 0.05$\n- $S_{\\text{set}} = 1200$ microstrain\n- $s_{\\text{slope}} = 300$ microstrain\n- $O_{\\text{base}} = 1.0$\n\nCompartment-specific properties are:\n- Axial: $S_{\\text{ax,base}} = 1400$ microstrain, $\\varphi_{\\text{ax}} = 0.02$\n- Appendicular: $S_{\\text{ap,base}} = 1800$ microstrain, $\\varphi_{\\text{ap}} = 0.05$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Test Case 1 (Baseline):** Here, $r_{\\text{ax}} = 1.0$, $r_{\\text{ap}} = 1.0$, and $m = 1.0$.\n    - For the axial skeleton, $S = 1.0 \\times 1400 = 1400$, $O = 1.0 \\times 1.0 = 1.0$, and $\\varphi = 0.02$. We compute $B_{\\text{ax,base}}^\\ast$.\n    - For the appendicular skeleton, $S = 1.0 \\times 1800 = 1800$, $O = 1.0 \\times 1.0 = 1.0$, and $\\varphi = 0.05$. We compute $B_{\\text{ap,base}}^\\ast$.\n\n2.  **Test Case 2 (Moderate Disuse):** Here, $r_{\\text{ax}} = 0.9$, $r_{\\text{ap}} = 0.7$, and $m = 1.2$.\n    - For the axial skeleton, $S = 0.9 \\times 1400 = 1260$, $O = 1.2 \\times 1.0 = 1.2$, $\\varphi = 0.02$. We compute $B_{\\text{ax},2}^\\ast$ and the change $\\Delta B_{\\text{ax},2}^\\ast = B_{\\text{ax},2}^\\ast - B_{\\text{ax,base}}^\\ast$.\n    - For the appendicular skeleton, $S = 0.7 \\times 1800 = 1260$, $O = 1.2 \\times 1.0 = 1.2$, $\\varphi = 0.05$. We compute $B_{\\text{ap},2}^\\ast$ and the change $\\Delta B_{\\text{ap},2}^\\ast = B_{\\text{ap},2}^\\ast - B_{\\text{ap,base}}^\\ast$.\n\n3.  **Test Case 3 (Severe Disuse):** Here, $r_{\\text{ax}} = 0.6$, $r_{\\text{ap}} = 0.3$, and $m = 1.5$.\n    - For the axial skeleton, $S = 0.6 \\times 1400 = 840$, $O = 1.5 \\times 1.0 = 1.5$, $\\varphi = 0.02$. We compute $B_{\\text{ax},3}^\\ast$ and the change $\\Delta B_{\\text{ax},3}^\\ast = B_{\\text{ax},3}^\\ast - B_{\\text{ax,base}}^\\ast$.\n    - For the appendicular skeleton, $S = 0.3 \\times 1800 = 540$, $O = 1.5 \\times 1.0 = 1.5$, $\\varphi = 0.05$. We compute $B_{\\text{ap},3}^\\ast$ and the change $\\Delta B_{\\text{ap},3}^\\ast = B_{\\text{ap},3}^\\ast - B_{\\text{ap,base}}^\\ast$.\n\nThe final results are the six values: $B_{\\text{ax,base}}^\\ast$, $B_{\\text{ap,base}}^\\ast$, $\\Delta B_{\\text{ax},2}^\\ast$, $\\Delta B_{\\text{ap},2}^\\ast$, $\\Delta B_{\\text{ax},3}^\\ast$, and $\\Delta B_{\\text{ap},3}^\\ast$, formatted as required.
