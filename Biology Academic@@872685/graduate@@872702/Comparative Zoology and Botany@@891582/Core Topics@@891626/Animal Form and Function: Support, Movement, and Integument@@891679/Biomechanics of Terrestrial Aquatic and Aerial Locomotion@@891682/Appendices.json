The fluid has density $\\rho$. The animal maintains neutral vertical acceleration by balancing its weight $mg$ with the sum of buoyancy and hydrodynamic lift, and wave-making effects are negligible at the chosen depth. Assume the Reynolds number (Re) is sufficiently large that inertial effects dominate over viscous diffusion, and that the steady hydrodynamic drag on the body can be characterized by a shape-dependent drag coefficient $C_{D}$ referred to a wetted reference area $A$. Neglect added-mass and unsteady inertial contributions over a stroke cycle so that their time-average is zero. Using only first principles for force balance and standard definitions from high Reynolds number external flow, derive the closed-form analytic expression for the time-averaged propulsive thrust required to maintain the constant speed $v$, expressed in terms of $m$, $v$, $\\rho$, $C_{D}$, and $A$. Express your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the given parameters. Use International System of Units (SI) conventions (newtons) if you compute a numerical value; no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the time-averaged propulsive thrust for an aquatic vertebrate to maintain a constant horizontal speed $v$. Let this thrust be denoted by $T$.\n\nAccording to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object moving with a constant velocity experiences zero net force. The vertebrate is swimming at a constant speed $v$ in a straight line (horizontally), thus its velocity is constant. Therefore, the vector sum of all external forces acting upon it must be zero. We analyze the forces in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe horizontal forces acting on the animal are the forward propulsive thrust, $T$, and the backward-acting hydrodynamic drag force, $F_D$. The problem statement permits neglecting unsteady inertial contributions over a stroke cycle, which allows us to work with time-averaged quantities. For motion at a constant velocity, the time-averaged net force in the direction of motion must be zero:\n$$ T - F_D = 0 $$\nThis provides the fundamental relationship that the required thrust must be equal in magnitude to the drag force:\n$$ T = F_D $$\n\nThe problem specifies that the flow regime is characterized by a \"sufficiently large\" Reynolds number, which signifies that inertial forces are dominant over viscous forces. In this high-Reynolds-number regime, the drag force on a submerged body is described by the drag equation:\n$$ F_D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^{2} C_{D} A $$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid (seawater), $v$ is the swimming speed, $A$ is the wetted reference area, and $C_{D}$ is the dimensionless drag coefficient, which is a function of the body's shape.\n\nBy substituting this expression for the drag force into the force balance equation, we arrive at the expression for the required propulsive thrust:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^{2} C_{D} A $$\n\nIt is important to note that the mass of the animal, $m$, is provided in the problem statement. This parameter is relevant to the vertical force balance, where the animal's weight, $mg$, is counteracted by the sum of buoyant force and any hydrodynamic lift generated by its body or fins. The problem states that neutral vertical acceleration is maintained, meaning these vertical forces are also in equilibrium. However, because the horizontal motion is decoupled from the vertical force balance under these assumptions, the mass $m$ is not a parameter in the final expression for the horizontal thrust.\n\nThe final expression for the propulsive thrust is therefore determined exclusively by the parameters governing hydrodynamic drag.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^{2} C_{D} A}\n$$", "id": "2551033"}, {"introduction": "Having established the cost of drag, we now turn to how animals efficiently generate thrust.

In the spring–pendulum framework of locomotion, walking is modeled as an inverted pendulum vault of the center of mass (COM) over a relatively stiff leg, whereas running is modeled as a spring–mass bounce with appreciable leg compression. Starting from Newton’s second law and the kinematics of circular motion, derive the natural dimensionless group that compares the inertial demand to the gravitational restoring influence for the COM when the stance leg is approximated as a rigid link of length $L$. Explain why this group controls the breakdown of the inverted-pendulum walking mechanism and motivates the spring–mass running mechanism.

In the inverted-pendulum picture of walking, the stance leg is treated as a rigid link of length $L$ about which the center of mass (COM) vaults during stance. The COM trajectory is approximately circular about the foot contact point near mid-stance. For circular motion of radius $L$ with speed $v$, the COM experiences a centripetal acceleration of magnitude\n$$\na_{c} = \\frac{v^{2}}{L}.\n$$\nNewton’s second law applied to the COM in the radial direction during mid-stance involves the ground reaction force (GRF), which must supply the centripetal acceleration in addition to balancing weight so that the foot does not detach and the leg does not go slack. A natural non-dimensionalization compares the inertial term $a_{c}$ to the gravitational acceleration $g$:\n$$\nFr \\equiv \\frac{a_{c}}{g} = \\frac{v^{2}}{g L}.\n$$\nThis is the Froude number (Fr), a dimensionless parameter widely used in comparative biomechanics to express dynamic similarity across size scales.\n\nWhy does $Fr$ control the breakdown of the inverted-pendulum mechanism? In an ideal inverted pendulum with a stiff leg and no aerial phase, the COM must be supported throughout stance with a ground reaction force that remains non-negative. At the apex of the vault (mid-stance), the radial force requirement is set by $m a_{c} = m v^{2}/L$. The weight $m g$ acts downward (away from the pivot in the inverted geometry), and the leg must provide sufficient compressive or tensile force to keep the COM on the curved path. If $v^{2}/L$ becomes large relative to $g$, the configuration approaches a limit where the required centripetal acceleration cannot be provided by a purely vaulting, stiff-leg mechanism without introducing significant leg compression and elastic storage. In other words, as $Fr$ increases, the inverted-pendulum energy exchange becomes less feasible and less economical, and the spring–mass bouncing solution (running) emerges as dynamically appropriate.\n\nIn comparative biped data, the empirically supported transition between dynamically appropriate walking and running occurs near\n$$\nFr_{c} = 0.5.\n$$\nWe will therefore use this threshold as a criterion: if $Fr < Fr_{c}$, walking is dynamically appropriate; if $Fr \\ge Fr_{c}$, running is dynamically appropriate.\n\nNow compute $Fr$ for the given organism:\n- Given $L = 0.95 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $v = 2.30 \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-1}}$, with $g = 9.81 \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-2}}$,\n$$\nFr = \\frac{v^{2}}{g L} = \\frac{(2.30)^{2}}{(9.81)(0.95)} = \\frac{5.29}{9.3195}.\n$$\nEvaluate the ratio symbolically as the quotient above and then numerically:\n$$\nFr \\approx 0.5674\\ldots\n$$\nNow apply the threshold $Fr_{c} = 0.5$.
