This first practice challenges you to think like an experimental embryologist by designing a robust set of criteria to distinguish between determinate and indeterminate development. By evaluating different experimental protocols involving blastomere ablation, isolation, and transplantation, you will learn to identify what constitutes a scientifically rigorous functional assay for assessing cell fate and potency in early embryos [@problem_id:2554641].", "problem": "You are tasked with developing operational, falsifiable criteria to score cleavage as determinate versus indeterminate in a newly discovered marine metazoan with unknown phylogenetic position and unknown cleavage geometry. You have a micromanipulation rig allowing precise blastomere ablation, isolation, and transplantation, and a fluorescence cell-tracking setup. You can stage embryos reliably at the $2$-, $4$-, and $8$-cell stages. Your goal is to choose a criterion set that would validly distinguish determinate from indeterminate cleavage using only functional assays of blastomere autonomy versus regulative capacity.\n\nAs foundational bases, you may assume the following well-tested definitions and facts:\n- Under autonomous specification (mosaic development), early blastomeres possess cell-autonomous determinants such that removal or isolation of a blastomere tends to yield stereotyped losses, while transplanted blastomeres tend to retain donor-like fates irrespective of position.\n- Under conditional specification (regulative development), early blastomeres are equipotent within constraints of global axes and intercellular signaling such that removal or isolation tends to be compensated, and transplanted blastomeres tend to adopt fates according to their new position.\n- In many taxa, spiral cleavage correlates with more determinate (autonomous) early development and radial cleavage correlates with more indeterminate (regulative) early development, but this correlation is not absolute and must not substitute for functional evidence of specification mode.\n- Blastomere potency and fate at the $2$- to $8$-cell stages can be probed by ablation, isolation, and transplantation, provided that appropriate controls for manipulation-induced damage, dye labeling, and staging are included.\n\nSelect the option that presents a scientifically sound, operational set of criteria using ablation, isolation, and transplantation that would allow you to score the novel species as determinate or indeterminate at early cleavage, with appropriate controls, stage specificity, replication, and quantitative thresholds that support statistical inference.\n\nA. Define early cleaving indeterminate versus determinate by the concurrence of at least two of three functional assays performed at the $2$- to $8$-cell stages, each with quantitative thresholds and controls. Use the following operational rules:\n- Isolation: Isolate single blastomeres from $2$- and $4$-cell embryos (both animal and vegetal when distinguishable) and culture individually. Score as indeterminate if a proportion $p_{\\text{whole}}$ of isolates forming complete albeit smaller larvae with correct anterior–posterior and dorsal–ventral axes is $\\geq 0.6$ at the $2$-cell stage and $\\geq 0.4$ at the $4$-cell stage, with $n \\geq 20$ isolates per stage, sham-manipulated intact controls, and axis marker validation; score as determinate if $p_{\\text{whole}} \\leq 0.1$ at both stages and the remaining isolates show stereotyped partial structures. Perform binomial tests at $\\alpha=0.05$ with confidence intervals to assess whether $p_{\\text{whole}}$ exceeds or falls below thresholds.\n- Ablation: Ablate one identified blastomere at the $4$-cell stage using a pulsed laser; score as indeterminate if a majority $p_{\\text{reg}} \\geq 0.5$ of embryos regulate to near-normal larval pattern with size reduction and restored axes, versus determinate if $p_{\\text{reg}} \\leq 0.2$ and ablations yield stereotyped, fate map-consistent losses. Use $n \\geq 20$ per ablation site with sham ablation and off-target laser controls.\n- Transplantation: Transplant fate-labeled donor blastomeres between non-equivalent positions at the $8$-cell stage. Score as indeterminate if a majority $p_{\\text{pos}} \\geq 0.7$ adopt host-appropriate fates by lineage tracing, whereas determinate if a majority $p_{\\text{ret}} \\geq 0.7$ retain donor-specified fates irrespective of position. Include orthotopic transplants and dye-only controls. Require that at least two assays concur for final classification to guard against stage-specific mixed modes.\nAdditionally, record but do not use cleavage geometry (radial versus spiral) as a deciding criterion, to avoid circular inference.\n\nB. Define indeterminate cleavage if the cleavage planes are orthogonal and symmetrical (radial) through the $8$-cell stage and define determinate if the planes are oblique and helical (spiral) through the $8$-cell stage. Do not perform ablation, isolation, or transplantation because cleavage geometry correlates with specification mode and suffices for classification. Use $n \\geq 5$ embryos per observation and no further statistics.\n\nC. Define indeterminate cleavage if ablation of one-quarter of the blastula epithelium at the late blastula or early gastrula stage leads to re-formation of a complete larva in $\\geq 50\\%$ of cases; define determinate if such ablation yields consistent pattern defects in $\\geq 50\\%$. Do not perform earlier manipulations to avoid interfering with cleavage. Validate outcomes by whole-mount gene expression at $24$ hours. A sample size of $n=8$ per condition is sufficient if differences are visually apparent.\n\nD. Define indeterminate cleavage if any single isolated blastomere from the $8$-cell stage can form a complete larva in culture; define determinate otherwise. Supplement with transplantation of unlabeled blastomeres at the $8$-cell stage and score success by embryo survival to gastrulation ($\\geq 70\\%$ survival indicates indeterminate). Controls are unnecessary if operator skill is high. Replicate each condition $n=3$ times to conserve animals.", "solution": "To evaluate which option provides valid operational criteria, start from foundational definitions of autonomous versus conditional specification and principles of functional assays.\n\nUnder autonomous specification (mosaic development), early blastomeres have restricted potency due to localized determinants. The predictions are: (i) isolation of a single early blastomere yields partial embryos or non-viable tissue, (ii) ablation creates stereotyped losses with little compensation, and (iii) transplantation results in donor cells retaining their original fate irrespective of new position. Under conditional specification (regulative development), early blastomeres are equipotent to a degree, so (i) isolated cells can form complete albeit smaller embryos at very early stages, (ii) ablated embryos can regulate and restore pattern, and (iii) transplanted cells adopt host positional fates.\n\nThe assays must be staged at early cleavage (e.g., $2$–$8$ cells), include appropriate controls for manipulation-induced artifacts (e.g., sham ablations, dye-only controls), and be replicated sufficiently for statistical inference. While cleavage geometry (radial versus spiral) is informative at a comparative level, it is correlated but not determinative of specification mode and thus cannot replace functional tests.\n\nNow assess each option:\n\nOption A: This proposes three independent functional assays—blastomere isolation at $2$- and $4$-cell stages, ablation at the $4$-cell stage, and transplantation at the $8$-cell stage—with explicit quantitative thresholds and replication. It incorporates:\n- Stage-appropriate manipulations: early cleavage stages ($2$–$8$ cells) where determinacy versus indeterminacy is classically assayed.\n- Isolation: The thresholds $p_{\\text{whole}} \\geq 0.6$ (at $2$-cell) and $\\geq 0.4$ (at $4$-cell) for complete miniature larvae are consistent with regulative potential, and $p_{\\text{whole}} \\leq 0.1$ indicates failure to produce whole larvae consistent with mosaic development. Using $n \\geq 20$ and binomial tests at $\\alpha=0.05$ allows statistical confidence.\n- Ablation: The prediction that $p_{\\text{reg}} \\geq 0.5$ indicates regulation versus $p_{\\text{reg}} \\leq 0.2$ indicating stereotyped defects aligns with conditional versus autonomous specification. Controls (sham and off-target) reduce confounds.\n- Transplantation: Majority adoption of host fate ($p_{\\text{pos}} \\geq 0.7$) versus fate retention ($p_{\\text{ret}} \\geq 0.7$) is a standard operationalization of conditional versus autonomous specification, respectively. Including orthotopic transplants and dye-only controls addresses labeling and handling artifacts.\n- Requiring at least two assays to concur recognizes that some species can show mixed modes across stages or axes. Recording but not using cleavage geometry avoids circular inference.\nThese criteria are falsifiable, operational, and grounded in well-tested developmental biology principles. Therefore, Option A is scientifically sound.\n\nVerdict for A: Correct.\n\nOption B: This bases classification solely on cleavage geometry through the $8$-cell stage, with minimal replication and no functional assays. While spiral cleavage often correlates with more determinate development and radial cleavage with more indeterminate development across metazoans, this correlation is not absolute; exceptions and mixed modes exist. Using geometry alone does not operationally test cell autonomy versus regulative capacity and risks misclassification. The small sample size $n \\geq 5$ with no inferential statistics further weakens reliability.\n\nVerdict for B: Incorrect.\n\nOption C: This uses ablations at late blastula or early gastrula stages and scores regeneration at $24$ hours. At these later stages, cell fates are more restricted and involve tissue-level morphogenetic processes; the assay does not probe cleavage-stage specification. Late regulation or lack thereof cannot be attributed specifically to cleavage determinacy. The threshold $\\geq 50\\%$ without proper early-stage controls and the small sample size $n=8$ are insufficient. This conflates later regenerative capacity with early cleavage mode.\n\nVerdict for C: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: This uses a single isolation assay at the $8$-cell stage with an “any success implies indeterminate” rule, which is not robust; some species may lose regulative capacity by the $8$-cell stage even if earlier stages are indeterminate, and a single success among few trials ($n=3$) could be an artifact. The transplantation component lacks fate mapping and uses survival to gastrulation as a proxy for fate adoption, which is not an appropriate endpoint to distinguish autonomy versus regulation. Absence of controls makes the design vulnerable to confounds.\n\nVerdict for D: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2554641"}, {"introduction": "With a solid experimental definition in hand, we now probe the fundamental causal differences between mosaic (determinate) and regulative (indeterminate) systems.

Species S exhibits stereotyped spiral cleavage and early determinate (mosaic) development; Species R exhibits stereotyped radial cleavage and early indeterminate (regulative) development. A small-molecule perturbation is applied from the zygote stage that randomizes mitotic spindle orientation at each early division (so cleavage planes are randomly oriented in three dimensions) while leaving cortical polarity, animal–vegetal axis cues, and the subcellular localization, chemical identity, and stability of known cytoplasmic determinants intact. The perturbation does not alter the timing of cytokinesis, cell–cell adhesion, or short-range signaling; it only randomizes spindle orientation. You observe embryos through the $8$–$16$-cell stages and then allow development to proceed.\n\nStarting from core definitions that distinguish intrinsic determinant-based specification from position- and interaction-based specification, and the empirical link between spindle orientation and cleavage-plane geometry, predict the most likely fate and morphological outcomes in Species S versus Species R under this perturbation.

The experimental design is a hypothetical but logically coherent \"thought experiment\" used to probe these principles.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is clearly defined. The perturbation is specific, and the variables held constant are explicitly listed. This allows for a deductive prediction based on the differing developmental strategies of the two species. A unique, logically derivable outcome exists.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information about the initial systems (S and R) and the nature of the experimental intervention. There are no internal contradictions. The statement that cytoplasmic determinant localization is intact, but spindle orientation is random, is the key non-contradictory premise: determinants are in their correct sub-cellular locations, but the plane of division that segregates them is now randomly oriented.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe analysis must consider the distinct developmental strategies of Species S and Species R.\n\n**Analysis of Species S (Mosaic Development)**\n- **Fundamental Principle**: In mosaic development, cell fate is specified intrinsically by the inheritance of cytoplasmic determinants. These determinants are asymmetrically localized in the egg and are partitioned to specific daughter blastomeres during a stereotyped sequence of cleavages. The identity of a cell is determined by its lineage, i.e., which determinants it inherits.\n- **Role of Spiral Cleavage**: The stereotyped, oblique orientation of the mitotic spindles in spiral cleavage is the mechanism that ensures the precise and reproducible partitioning of these localized determinants. For example, a determinant localized at the vegetal pole of a zygote is reliably passed to a specific lineage of cells (e.g., the $4d$ mesentoblast).\n- **Effect of Perturbation**: The perturbation randomizes mitotic spindle orientation. Consequently, the cleavage plane, which forms perpendicular to the spindle, is also randomized. While the determinants remain localized within a given cell's cytoplasm before division, their segregation to the two daughter cells becomes a stochastic event. A determinant may be inherited by one daughter cell, the other, both (if the cleavage plane happens to bisect the determinant's location), or neither (if the plane segregates the determinant-containing cytoplasm to only one daughter, which then has it).\n- **Predicted Outcome for S**: The predictable, orderly segregation of fate determinants is destroyed. Blastomeres will inherit random combinations of determinants. Because the developmental program is determinate, a blastomere that stochastically inherits a \"muscle\" determinant will attempt to form muscle tissue, regardless of its position in the disorganized cell mass. This leads to a chaotic embryo with ectopic tissues (structures in the wrong place), missing structures (if no cell inherits the necessary determinant), and a complete failure to form a coherent body plan. The system lacks the ability to regulate or compensate for these errors because cell fate is intrinsically fixed early on. An ablation of a cell would lead to a specific defect, and this perturbation is mechanistically analogous to a random reassignment of cell contents, which the system cannot correct.\n\n**Analysis of Species R (Regulative Development)**\n- **Fundamental Principle**: In regulative development, cell fate is specified extrinsically by positional information and cell-to-cell interactions (conditional specification). Early blastomeres are totipotent or pluripotent, meaning their developmental potential is greater than their normal fate. Their ultimate identity depends on signals received from their neighbors and their position within the embryo. Cytoplasmic determinants for early fate specification are either absent or distributed homogeneously.\n- **Role of Radial Cleavage**: The simple, orthogonal cleavage planes of radial cleavage create a geometrically regular array of cells. This organization facilitates the establishment of signaling gradients and defined neighbor-neighbor contacts that are crucial for conditional specification.\n- **Effect of Perturbation**: The perturbation randomizes cleavage planes, creating a geometrically disordered clump of cells instead of a regular morula or blastula. The normal spatial relationships between blastomeres are lost.\n- **Predicted Outcome for R**: Although the geometry is disrupted, the fundamental mechanism of fate specification is not. The problem explicitly states that cell-cell adhesion and short-range signaling are intact. The blastomeres themselves remain intrinsically equivalent and pluripotent. In the disordered mass, cells still contact other cells and exist at different positions relative to the conserved animal-vegetal axis. These cells can therefore still signal to each other, sense their new positions, and adopt appropriate fates. The embryo's powerful regulative capacity will work to overcome the initial geometric noise. While development might be delayed or exhibit minor abnormalities, it is expected to largely correct itself, resulting in a mostly normal organism. The ability of an early isolated blastomere to form a near-complete larva is the hallmark of regulation, and this internal potential of each cell remains unchanged.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. Species S: Blastomeres that stochastically inherit localized determinants execute their committed fates regardless of position; misallocation relative to the body axes yields frequent ectopic or missing structures, and ablations are not compensated. Species R: Early blastomeres remain functionally equivalent; despite geometric noise, cell–cell interactions and positional cues re-establish pattern, yielding largely normal morphogenesis and high regulative capacity (e.g., isolated $2$-cell blastomeres can each form near-complete larvae).**\n  - This option precisely matches the derived predictions for both species. It correctly identifies stochastic determinant segregation and autonomous fate execution in S, leading to chaos. It correctly identifies the overriding power of regulative mechanisms (signaling, positional cues) over geometric noise in R because blastomeres remain equivalent.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Species S: Minimal impact, because determinant presence alone ensures equal partitioning at each division; development remains normal. Species R: Randomized spindles abolish regulative ability by scrambling neighbor contacts, causing severe, non-compensated defects and loss of axis formation.**\n  - The premise for Species S is false. Determinants are localized; random cleavage planes will cause random, not equal, partitioning. The impact will be catastrophic, not minimal.\n  - The premise for Species R is false. While neighbor contacts are scrambled, the mechanisms for signaling and regulation are intact. Regulative ability is robust to such perturbations; it is not abolished.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Both species convert to mosaic outcomes because randomized spindles universally bias asymmetric segregation of determinants, locking in early fates independent of original developmental mode.**\n  - This is incorrect because Species R does not rely on fate determinants for early specification. One cannot induce a mosaic outcome by segregating determinants that are not functionally relevant for this process in the first place. The option incorrectly generalizes the mechanism of Species S to Species R.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Species S: Randomized spindles force symmetric segregation of determinants to all blastomeres, erasing mosaicism and producing regulative behavior. Species R: The perturbation induces premature asymmetric segregation of determinants, converting development to mosaic and causing lineage-specific losses that cannot be rescued.**\n  - The premise for Species S is false. Random orientation does not \"force\" symmetry; it randomizes the outcome, which can be symmetric or asymmetric on a case-by-case basis. It introduces noise, it does not create a new regulative system.\n  - The premise for Species R is false, for the same reason as option C. It incorrectly assumes the presence and function of mosaic-style determinants in a regulative system.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal conclusion points to Option A as the only one that correctly applies the fundamental principles of development to the given experimental setup.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2554644"}, {"introduction": "Modern developmental biology increasingly relies on quantitative data to describe and classify complex patterns.

At $\\theta=3\\pi/4$, $\\cos(4\\cdot3\\pi/4)=\\cos(3\\pi)=-1$.\n    The term $\\cos(4\\theta)$ naturally distinguishes between the two classes. We can therefore set the phase $\\mu=0$ and model the two classes by varying the concentration parameter $k$. The probability density function is of the form:\n    $$f(\\theta; k) = C(k) \\exp(k \\cos(4\\theta))$$\n    where $C(k)$ is a normalization constant. For the radial class ($H_R$), we require high probability where $\\cos(4\\theta)=1$, which implies $k > 0$. For the spiral class ($H_S$), we require high probability where $\\cos(4\\theta)=-1$, which implies $k < 0$. The minimal and symmetric choice is to set $k=k_0$ for radial and $k=-k_0$ for spiral, for some constant $k_0>0$. We can, without loss of generality, take $k_0=1$.\n    -   $H_R: f_R(\\theta) = C(1) \\exp(\\cos(4\\theta))$\n    -   $H_S: f_S(\\theta) = C(-1) \\exp(-\\cos(4\\theta))$\n    The normalization constant is $C(k) = \\left(\\int_0^\\pi \\exp(k\\cos(4\\theta)) d\\theta\\right)^{-1}$. The integral evaluates to $\\pi I_0(k)$, where $I_0$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. Since $I_0(k) = I_0(-k)$, the normalization constants are equal: $C(1)=C(-1)$.\n\n4.  **Bayes Decision Rule**: We are given a set of i.i.d. samples $\\{\\theta_i\\}_{i=1}^n$. With equal priors $P(H_R) = P(H_S) = 1/2$, the Bayes-optimal rule is to choose the class with the maximum likelihood.\n    -   Likelihood for Radial: $L_R = \\prod_{i=1}^n f_R(\\theta_i) = (C(1))^n \\exp\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i)\\right)$\n    -   Likelihood for Spiral: $L_S = \\prod_{i=1}^n f_S(\\theta_i) = (C(-1))^n \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i)\\right)$\n    We classify as radial if $L_R \\ge L_S$ (with ties broken for radial). Since $C(1)=C(-1)$, this simplifies to:\n    $$\\exp\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i)\\right) \\ge \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i)\\right)$$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, which is a monotonic function:\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i) \\ge -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i)$$\n    $$2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i) \\ge 0 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i) \\ge 0$$\n\n5.  **Sufficient Statistic and Threshold**: The problem asks for a sample statistic $S$. A natural choice is the sample mean of the quantity in the summation:\n    $$S = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i)$$\n    The decision rule then becomes:\n    $$\\text{Predict Radial if } S \\ge 0, \\text{ otherwise predict Spiral.}$$\n    This provides the required statistic $S$ and the threshold $T$.\n    -   **Statistic**: $S = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(4\\theta_i)$\n    -   **Threshold**: $T = 0$\n\n**Task 2 & 3: Application to Test Data**\n\nWe now apply this derived classifier to each dataset. For each angle $\\theta_i$ in degrees, we compute $\\cos(4\\theta_i)$, where the argument to the cosine function is in radians. The statistic $S$ is the average of these values. A label of $R=1$ is assigned for radial if $S \\ge 0$, and $R=0$ for spiral if $S < 0$. The indeterminate label $I$ is set equal to $R$.\n\n-   **Dataset A**: $n=10$. Angles: $\\{-5, 2, 1, 0, 89, 92, 88, 91, -2, 93\\}$.\n    The values of $\\cos(4\\theta_i)$ are highly positive as the angles are clustered near $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$.\n    $S_A = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum \\cos(4\\theta_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{10}(9.8618) = 0.98618$.\n    $S_A \\approx 0.9862$. Since $S_A > 0$, we classify as Radial ($R_A=1$) and Indeterminate ($I_A=1$).\n    Triple: $[0.9862, 1, 1]$.\n\n-   **Dataset B**: $n=8$. Angles: $\\{45, 46, 44, 135, 134, 136, 45, 135\\}$.\n    The values of $\\cos(4\\theta_i)$ are highly negative as the angles are clustered near $45^\\circ$ and $135^\\circ$.\n    $S_B = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum \\cos(4\\theta_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{8}(-7.9904) = -0.9988$.\n    $S_B = -0.9988$. Since $S_B < 0$, we classify as Spiral ($R_B=0$) and Determinate ($I_B=0$).\n    Triple: $[-0.9988, 0, 0]$.\n\n-   **Dataset C**: $n=4$. Angles: $\\{0, 45, 90, 135\\}$.\n    The values of $\\cos(4\\theta_i)$ are $\\{1, -1, 1, -1\\}$.\n    $S_C = \\frac{1}{4}(1 - 1 + 1 - 1) = 0$.\n    $S_C = 0.0000$. Since $S_C = T=0$, the tie-breaking rule applies. We classify as Radial ($R_C=1$) and Indeterminate ($I_C=1$).\n    Triple: $[0.0000, 1, 1]$.\n\n-   **Dataset D**: $n=9$. Angles: $\\{0, 5, 10, 80, 95, 90, 40, 50, 140\\}$.\n    This is a noisy radial dataset. The axial angles contribute positive terms, while the oblique contaminants contribute negative terms.\n    $S_D = \\frac{1}{9} \\sum \\cos(4\\theta_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{9}(1.0 + 0.9397 + 0.7660 + 0.7660 + 0.9397 + 1.0 - 0.9397 - 0.9397 - 0.9397) = \\frac{1.5923}{9} \\approx 0.17692$.\n    $S_D \\approx 0.1769$. Since $S_D > 0$, we classify as Radial ($R_D=1$) and Indeterminate ($I_D=1$).\n    Triple: $[0.1769, 1, 1]$.\n\n-   **Dataset E**: $n=8$. Angles: $\\{45, 50, 40, 135, 130, 140, 0, 90\\}$.\n    This is a noisy spiral dataset. The diagonal angles contribute negative terms, while the axial contaminants contribute positive terms.\n    $S_E = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum \\cos(4\\theta_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{8}(-1.0 - 0.9397 - 0.9397 - 1.0 - 0.9397 - 0.9397 + 1.0 + 1.0) = \\frac{-2.7588}{8} \\approx -0.34485$.\n    $S_E \\approx -0.3449$. Since $S_E < 0$, we classify as Spiral ($R_E=0$) and Determinate ($I_E=0$).\n    Triple: $[-0.3449, 0, 0]$.\n\nThese calculations lead to the final implementation and output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the cleavage pattern classification problem based on first principles.\n\n    The solution is derived by modeling the two classes (radial vs. spiral)\n    using a minimal circular exponential family consistent with 90-degree\n    rotational symmetry.
