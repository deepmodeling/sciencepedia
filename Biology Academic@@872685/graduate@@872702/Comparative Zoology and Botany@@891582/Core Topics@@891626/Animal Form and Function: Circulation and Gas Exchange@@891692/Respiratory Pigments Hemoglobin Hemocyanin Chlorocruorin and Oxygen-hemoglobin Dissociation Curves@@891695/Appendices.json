Hemoglobin and hemocyanin are well-known respiratory pigments. The concepts of the oxygen dissociation curve (ODC), half-saturation pressure ($P_{50}$), and cooperativity (steepness of the ODC) are fundamental. The given ranges for environmental and tissue $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ are realistic for aquatic organisms in an estuary.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, consistent information to allow a logical deduction about the functional consequences of differing cooperativity, given a shared $P_{50}$. The question is specific and a unique, meaningful answer can be derived from the premises.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using objective, quantitative terms ($P_{50}$, $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ ranges) and standard physiological concepts (\"steeper\" vs. \"shallower\" curve, cooperativity). There is no subjective or ambiguous language that would prevent a rigorous analysis.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The assumptions to ignore the Bohr effect and concentration differences are standard for isolating a specific variable—in this case, the effect of cooperativity. This does not render the problem incomplete but rather focuses the scope of the required analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe shape of the oxygen dissociation curve, which relates the percent saturation of the pigment ($S$) to the partial pressure of oxygen ($p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$), is described by its sigmoidal nature. This shape is governed by two key parameters: the half-saturation pressure, $P_{50}$, and the cooperativity, often quantified by the Hill coefficient, $n_H$.\n\nThe problem states that both pigments have the same $P_{50} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. By definition, this means that at $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, both pigments are exactly $50\\%$ saturated.\n$$ S_{\\text{Hb}}(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}=30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}) = S_{\\text{Hc}}(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}=30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}) = 50\\% $$\n\nThe problem also states that the hemoglobin (Hb) curve is \"markedly steeper\" and the hemocyanin (Hc) curve is \"shallower\". In the context of ODCs, a steeper curve corresponds to higher cooperativity, which is represented by a larger Hill coefficient, $n_H$. Therefore, we have $n_{H,\\text{Hb}} > n_{H,\\text{Hc}}$.\n\nWe must analyze the saturation behavior for two general cases relative to $P_{50}$:\n1.  When $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} > P_{50}$: A pigment with higher cooperativity (steeper curve) will exhibit a more rapid increase in saturation as $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ rises above $P_{50}$. Consequently, for any given $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} > P_{50}$, the pigment with the steeper curve will have a higher saturation.\n    $$ \\text{For } p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} > 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}, S_{\\text{Hb}}(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}) > S_{\\text{Hc}}(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}) $$\n2.  When $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} < P_{50}$: A pigment with higher cooperativity will exhibit a more rapid decrease in saturation as $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ falls below $P_{50}$. Consequently, for any given $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} < P_{50}$, the pigment with the steeper curve will have a lower saturation.\n    $$ \\text{For } p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} < 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}, S_{\\text{Hb}}(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}) < S_{\\text{Hc}}(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}) $$\n\nNow, we apply these principles to the conditions specified in the problem.\n\n**Oxygen Loading at the Gills:**\nThe $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}}$ fluctuates between $25\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ and $120\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. \"Superior loading\" means achieving a higher percentage of saturation at a given $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$.\n-   In the high-oxygen part of the cycle ($p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}} > 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, up to $120\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$), hemoglobin's higher cooperativity ensures it reaches a higher saturation than hemocyanin. This constitutes superior loading performance.\n-   In the low-oxygen part of the cycle ($p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$), which is a condition where $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} < P_{50}$, hemoglobin will have a lower saturation than hemocyanin. In this specific hypoxic scenario, hemocyanin provides superior loading.\n\n**Oxygen Unloading in the Tissues:**\nThe $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{tissue}}$ ranges from $10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ to $30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. \"Superior unloading\" means releasing a larger fraction of bound oxygen, which corresponds to achieving a lower saturation level at the tissue $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$.\n- The entire working range of tissue $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ during activity ($10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\le p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{tissue}} < 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) is below the $P_{50}$. In this range, hemoglobin's higher cooperativity causes its saturation to be lower than that of hemocyanin. This lower saturation at the tissues signifies that more oxygen has been released. Therefore, hemoglobin provides superior unloading to active tissues.\n- At rest, when $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{tissue}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = P_{50}$, both pigments have equal saturation ($50\\%$) and thus their performance at this specific point is identical.\n\n**Summary of Performance:**\n-   **Loading:** Hemoglobin is superior when $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}} > P_{50}$. Hemocyanin is superior when $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}} < P_{50}$.\n-   **Unloading:** Hemoglobin is superior when $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{tissue}} < P_{50}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Hemoglobin, by virtue of its steeper slope, provides superior loading at the gills whenever $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}} > P_{50}$ and superior unloading in tissues whenever $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{tissue}} < P_{50}$; hemocyanin surpasses hemoglobin in loading only when $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}} < P_{50}$.**\nThis statement accurately reflects our derivation. It correctly identifies that hemoglobin's higher cooperativity is advantageous for loading at high $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ (above $P_{50}$) and for unloading at low $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ (below $P_{50}$). It also correctly notes the specific condition ($p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}} < P_{50}$) under which the shallower hemocyanin curve provides a loading advantage.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Hemocyanin, because of its shallower slope, provides superior loading at the gills whenever $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{gill}} > P_{50}$ by maintaining higher saturation over a wider $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ range, and also superior unloading in tissues when $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{tissue}} < P_{50}$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. For $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} > P_{50}$, the steeper curve (hemoglobin) achieves higher saturation, not the shallower one. Furthermore, for $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{tissue}} < P_{50}$, hemocyanin's higher saturation indicates poorer unloading, as it retains oxygen more strongly than hemoglobin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. With identical $P_{50}$ at $15^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, hemoglobin and hemocyanin necessarily have identical loading and unloading performance at all $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ values.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly assumes that $P_{50}$ is the sole determinant of ODC performance. It ignores the crucial role of cooperativity (the slope or shape of the curve), which was explicitly stated to be different. Performance is identical only at the exact point where $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = P_{50}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Hemoglobin’s higher cooperativity impairs both loading and unloading across all $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ values because it overly stabilizes the high-affinity conformation, making the shallower hemocyanin universally superior under the stated conditions.**\nThis statement is incorrect and demonstrates a misunderstanding of cooperativity. High cooperativity enhances, not impairs, loading at high $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ and unloading at low $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$. It describes the efficiency of the transition between low- and high-affinity states. The claim that hemocyanin is \"universally superior\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2607614"}, {"introduction": "While the oxygen dissociation curve describes the *fractional* saturation of a respiratory pigment, the ultimate measure of respiratory performance is the *total* amount of oxygen transported by the blood.

The numerical values provided are physiologically realistic for arterial blood in a healthy vertebrate. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe derivation and solution proceed.\n\nThe total oxygen content in whole blood, denoted as $C_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, is the sum of two distinct components: the oxygen chemically bound to the respiratory pigment (hemoglobin) and the oxygen physically dissolved in the blood plasma. We can express this fundamental relationship as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2} + C_{\\text{dissolved O}_2}$$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2}$ is the concentration of hemoglobin-bound oxygen and $C_{\\text{dissolved O}_2}$ is the concentration of dissolved oxygen. We shall derive an expression for each component from the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, consider the hemoglobin-bound oxygen, $C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2}$. The maximum amount of oxygen that can be bound by hemoglobin per unit volume of blood is defined as the oxygen-carrying capacity. This capacity is the product of the hemoglobin concentration, $[\\mathrm{Hb}]$, and the maximal amount of oxygen that one gram of hemoglobin can bind, which is the Hüfner constant, $H$.\n$$\\text{Maximal O}_2\\text{ capacity} = [\\mathrm{Hb}] \\times H$$\nA dimensional analysis confirms the correctness of this expression for a concentration:\n$$\\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL\\ O}_2}{\\mathrm{g}} \\right] = \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL\\ O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\right]$$\nThe actual amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is this maximal capacity multiplied by the fractional saturation, $Y$. The fractional saturation $Y$ represents the proportion of available oxygen-binding sites on the hemoglobin molecules that are actually occupied by oxygen.\nTherefore, the concentration of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2} = H \\times [\\mathrm{Hb}] \\times Y$$\n\nSecond, we consider the physically dissolved oxygen, $C_{\\text{dissolved O}_2}$. According to Henry’s law, the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in the gaseous phase in equilibrium with the liquid. The constant of proportionality is the solubility coefficient, $\\alpha$.\nThus, for oxygen dissolved in blood, the relationship is:\n$$C_{\\text{dissolved O}_2} = \\alpha \\times p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$$\nA dimensional analysis again confirms the validity of this expression:\n$$\\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL\\ O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL} \\cdot \\mathrm{mmHg}} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\mathrm{mmHg} \\right] = \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL\\ O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\right]$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the two components back into the initial equation, we obtain the complete expression for the total whole-blood oxygen content, $C_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = (H \\times [\\mathrm{Hb}] \\times Y) + (\\alpha \\times p_{\\mathrm{O}_2})$$\nThis is the required expression derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical evaluation using the given values:\n- $H = 1.34 \\mathrm{mL\\ O_2\\ g^{-1}}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Hb}] = 15 \\mathrm{g\\ dL^{-1}}$\n- $Y = 0.95$\n- $\\alpha = 0.0031 \\mathrm{mL\\ O_2\\ dL^{-1}\\ mmHg^{-1}}$\n- $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 100 \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived equation:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = (1.34 \\times 15 \\times 0.95) + (0.0031 \\times 100)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of hemoglobin-bound oxygen:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2} = 1.34 \\times 15 \\times 0.95 = 20.1 \\times 0.95 = 19.095 \\mathrm{mL\\ O_2\\ dL^{-1}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the concentration of dissolved oxygen:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{dissolved O}_2} = 0.0031 \\times 100 = 0.31 \\mathrm{mL\\ O_2\\ dL^{-1}}$$\n\nFinally, we sum these two components to find the total oxygen content:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 19.095 + 0.31 = 19.405 \\mathrm{mL\\ O_2\\ dL^{-1}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
