Since flow is from source ($x=0$) to sink ($x=L$), the flow rate $Q(x)$ must be positive for any $x$ where transport is occurring. Given that both $Q(x)$ and $K(x)$ are positive, the equation requires that the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP(x)}{dx}$ must be negative. Therefore, a fundamental, falsifiable prediction of the Münch model is that hydrostatic (turgor) pressure must decrease monotonically along the transport pathway from source to sink.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this prediction:\n\n**A.** This option correctly identifies the prediction of a monotonically declining hydrostatic pressure ($P(x)$) from source to sink. It also correctly specifies the gold-standard experimental method for testing this: in vivo turgor measurements using an aphid stylet coupled to a pressure probe at multiple points along the phloem path. This is a direct test of the model's central mechanism.\n\n**B.** This option predicts a monotonic decrease in sucrose concentration, $C(x)$. This is not a required prediction. Under the assumption of no solute leakage, the solute flux $Q(x)C(x)$ is constant. If water enters the phloem from the xylem along the path, $Q(x)$ increases, which would cause $C(x)$ to decrease. However, if water exits, $Q(x)$ would decrease, causing $C(x)$ to increase. Therefore, a monotonic decrease in concentration is not a necessary condition. Also, the question asks for a prediction about hydrostatic pressure.\n\n**C.** This option incorrectly predicts that phloem pressure becomes negative (tension). Phloem consists of living cells that maintain positive turgor pressure; they cannot sustain tension and would collapse. The proposed measurement technique (Scholander chamber) measures xylem water potential, not phloem turgor.\n\n**D.** This option predicts a uniform hydrostatic pressure, which contradicts the model. A uniform pressure means a zero pressure gradient ($\\frac{dP}{dx} = 0$), which would result in zero flow according to the Hagen-Poiseuille law. The model is explicitly a \"pressure-flow\" mechanism.\n\n**E.** This option makes a prediction about the total water potential, $\\Psi(x)$, not the hydrostatic pressure, $P(x)$. Furthermore, the prediction that $\\frac{d\\Psi}{dx}=0$ is generally incorrect. Since phloem and xylem are hydraulically coupled, one would expect the phloem water potential gradient to mirror the xylem's, which is typically negative in a transpiring plant.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that presents a correct, core prediction about the hydrostatic pressure profile and pairs it with an appropriate experimental test.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2603246"}]}
