It presents a standard, albeit simplified, biophysical model of root growth kinetics that is based on fundamental principles of cell population dynamics. The provided parameters are within a biologically plausible range, and the problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. Therefore, a formal solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the primary root elongation rate, which we shall denote by $R$. This rate is determined by the collective contribution of new cells that are produced in the Root Apical Meristem (RAM), pass through the elongation zone, and reach their final mature length. At steady state, the macroscopic elongation rate is the product of the flux of cells exiting the proliferative zone, which we denote as $F$, and the mean final length contributed by each cell, $L_c$.\n\nThe fundamental relationship is thus:\n$$R = F \\cdot L_c$$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to determining the cell flux, $F$. We are given that the system is at a steady state. This implies that the number of cells in the proliferative population, $N_p$, remains constant over time. This constancy is maintained by a dynamic equilibrium: the rate of new cell production via mitosis within the proliferative zone must be exactly balanced by the rate at which cells exit this zone to enter the zone of elongation. Therefore, the cell flux $F$ is equal to the total cell production rate within the RAM.\n\nTo determine the cell production rate, we employ the specified framework of exponential cell-cycle kinetics. In such a model, the rate of increase of a cell population is proportional to its current size. If we were to consider the population in isolation (without cell exit), its size $N(t)$ at time $t$ would be governed by the differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k N(t)$$\nwhere $k$ is the specific growth rate constant. The solution to this is $N(t) = N(0) \\exp(kt)$.\n\nThe problem states that the mean cell cycle time, $T_c$, is equivalent to the doubling time of the population. The doubling time, by definition, is the time required for the population to double in size, i.e., $N(T_c) = 2N(0)$. Substituting this into the solution of the differential equation yields:\n$$2N(0) = N(0) \\exp(k T_c)$$\n$$2 = \\exp(k T_c)$$\nSolving for the specific growth rate $k$ gives:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_c}$$\n\nThe total cell production rate at any instant is given by the term $\\frac{dN}{dt} = k N_p$. At steady state, with a constant proliferative population of size $N_p$, this production rate is constant and is given by:\n$$\\text{Production Rate} = k N_p = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_c} N_p$$\n\nAs established by the steady-state condition, this production rate must equal the flux $F$ of cells exiting the meristem.\n$$F = \\frac{\\ln(2) N_p}{T_c}$$\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for the flux $F$ back into our original equation for the root elongation rate $R$:\n$$R = \\left( \\frac{\\ln(2) N_p}{T_c} \\right) L_c$$\n\nThis is the general analytical expression for the root elongation rate under the given assumptions.

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-consistent problem in quantitative biology. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nFirst, we establish the functional dependency of lateral root density ($D$) on the primary input variables, PLT level ($P$) and PIN level ($N$).\nBy substituting the given equations, we have:\n$$D(P, N) = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{LR}}(N)}{v(M(P))} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{LR}}(N)}{k_{v}M(P)}$$\nSubstituting the Hill-type functions for $M(P)$ and $R_{\\mathrm{LR}}(N)$:\n$$D(P, N) = \\frac{R_{\\max}\\,\\frac{N^{m}}{K_{R}^{m} + N^{m}}}{k_{v} \\left( M_{\\max}\\,\\frac{P^{n}}{K_{M}^{n} + P^{n}} \\right)}$$\n$$D(P, N) = \\left( \\frac{R_{\\max}}{k_{v}M_{\\max}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{N^{m}}{K_{R}^{m} + N^{m}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_{M}^{n} + P^{n}}{P^{n}} \\right)$$\nThis final expression reveals that lateral root density ($D$) is an increasing function of PIN level ($N$) and a decreasing function of PLT level ($P$).
