The primordia are modeled as points in the plane in polar coordinates, where the $n$-th primordium has angle $\\theta_n$ and radius $r_n$. The divergence angle is a constant $\\alpha$ specified in degrees, and the plastochron ratio is a constant $\\rho > 1$ (dimensionless) such that each successive radius scales by $\\rho$. Use the following foundational definitions and empirically supported facts:\n\n- The $n$-th primordium is placed at polar coordinates $(r_n, \\theta_n)$ with\n  $$r_n = r_0 \\,\\rho^n \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\theta_n = n\\,\\alpha,$$\n  where $r_0 > 0$ is an arbitrary reference radius. You must take $r_0 = 1$ for all computations because only relative distances matter in the criterion below.\n- Angles used for any trigonometric computation must be in radians. The divergence angle $\\alpha$ is provided in degrees and must be converted to radians internally as $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\alpha \\cdot \\pi/180$.\n- For any two primordia separated by an index offset $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, define the principal angular difference $\\Delta\\theta_k \\in [0,\\pi]$ via wrapping to the interval $[-\\pi,\\pi]$:\n  $$\\Delta\\theta_k = \\min\\left(\\left| \\left(k\\,\\alpha_{\\mathrm{rad}} + \\pi \\right) \\bmod 2\\pi - \\pi \\right|, \\, \\pi \\right).$$\n- In Euclidean geometry in the plane, the squared distance between two points $(r_1,\\theta_1)$ and $(r_2,\\theta_2)$ is\n  $$d^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2 r_1 r_2 \\cos(\\theta_2 - \\theta_1).$$\n\nFrom these fundamentals, it follows that the Euclidean distance between primordia $n$ and $n+k$ can be written in the normalized, dimensionless form (independent of $n$)\n$$\\delta_k = \\sqrt{1 + \\rho^{2k} - 2 \\rho^k \\cos(\\Delta\\theta_k)},$$\nwhich is the distance scaled by $r_n$ due to the logarithmic scaling of radii by $\\rho$.\n\nDefine the dominant parastichy pair as the pair of coprime positive integers $(k_1,k_2)$, with $1 \\le k_1 < k_2 \\le K_{\\max}$, that minimize the product $\\delta_{k_1}\\,\\delta_{k_2}$.

Prefer the pair with smaller $\\max(k_1,k_2)$.\n2. If still tied, prefer the pair with smaller $k_2$.\n3. If still tied, prefer the pair with smaller $k_1$.\n\nYou must simulate the first $N$ primordia implicitly via the model above, but the computation of the dominant parastichy pair must use the normalized distance criterion.

It is scientifically grounded in established models of phyllotaxis, mathematically well-posed with a clear objective function and constraints, and free of ambiguity or contradiction. It represents a formal computational task derived from principles of developmental botany and geometry. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe solution is designed as a deterministic algorithm that implements the specified criteria for identifying the dominant parastichy pair. The methodology is structured into three main phases: parameter initialization, pre-computation of normalized distances, and a systematic search for the optimal pair.\n\n**1. Parameter Initialization and Constants**\n\nFor each given test case, defined by the tuple $(\\alpha, \\rho, N)$, we begin by setting up the necessary parameters for calculation.\n- The divergence angle $\\alpha$, provided in degrees, must be converted to radians for use in trigonometric functions. The conversion is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\alpha \\cdot \\pi / 180$.\n- The maximum separation index, $K_{\\max}$, must be determined according to the problem specification. It is defined as $K_{\\max} = \\min(N-1, 60)$, where $N$ is the number of primordia. This caps the search space to a computationally manageable size. For all test cases, $N \\ge 8$, which guarantees $K_{\\max} \\ge 7$ and allows for the formation of pairs $(k_1, k_2)$ with $1 \\le k_1 < k_2$.\n\n**2. Pre-computation of Normalized Distances $\\delta_k$**\n\nThe optimization criterion depends on the normalized distances $\\delta_k$. To avoid redundant calculations, we pre-compute and store these values for all relevant separation indices $k$, from $k=1$ to $k=K_{\\max}$. For each integer $k$ in this range, the value of $\\delta_k$ is calculated as follows:\n\n- First, the principal angular difference $\\Delta\\theta_k$ is computed. The total angle for a separation of $k$ primordia is $k\\,\\alpha_{\\mathrm{rad}}$. This angle is wrapped to the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ to find the shortest angle between the vectors. The given formula is $\\left(k\\,\\alpha_{\\mathrm{rad}} + \\pi \\right) \\bmod 2\\pi - \\pi$, which correctly maps the angle to $[-\\pi, \\pi)$. Let this wrapped angle be $\\phi_k$. The principal angular difference is then the magnitude $\\Delta\\theta_k = |\\phi_k| \\in [0, \\pi]$.\n- Second, with $\\Delta\\theta_k$ known, we compute the normalized distance $\\delta_k$ using the provided formula, which is derived from the law of cosines in a logarithmically growing spiral:\n$$\n\\delta_k = \\sqrt{1 + \\rho^{2k} - 2 \\rho^k \\cos(\\Delta\\theta_k)}\n$$\nThese values are stored in an array for efficient lookup during the search phase.\n\n**3. Systematic Search for the Dominant Parastichy Pair**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a specific pair of integers $(k_1, k_2)$ that satisfies a set of hierarchical criteria. The pair must consist of a coprime pair of integers, $k_1$ and $k_2$, such that $1 \\le k_1 < k_2 \\le K_{\\max}$. The search for the optimal pair proceeds by systematically checking all valid candidate pairs.\n\n- We iterate through all possible values of $k_2$ from $2$ to $K_{\\max}$, and for each $k_2$, we iterate through all possible values of $k_1$ from $1$ to $k_2-1$.\n- For each pair $(k_1, k_2)$, we perform a coprimality test. This is achieved by computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $k_1$ and $k_2$. If $\\text{gcd}(k_1, k_2) = 1$, the pair is a valid candidate.\n- For each valid candidate pair, we evaluate its \"quality\" based on the specified criteria. The primary criterion is to minimize the product of the normalized distances, $P = \\delta_{k_1} \\delta_{k_2}$. The secondary and tertiary criteria are tie-breaking rules: if products are equal, prefer the pair with smaller $\\max(k_1, k_2)$ (which is equivalent to smaller $k_2$), and then smaller $k_1$.\n- This hierarchical optimization problem can be elegantly solved by finding the minimum of a tuple. For each candidate pair $(k_1, k_2)$, we form a tuple $(P, k_2, k_1)$. We maintain a \"best\" tuple found so far and update it whenever a new candidate pair yields a lexicographically smaller tuple. Lexicographical comparison of $(P, k_2, k_1)$ naturally enforces the primary minimization of $P$, followed by minimization of $k_2$, and finally minimization of $k_1$.\n\nThe algorithm begins with an initial \"best\" tuple set to $(\\infty, \\infty, \\infty)$. After checking all valid pairs, the pair $(k_1, k_2)$ corresponding to the final \"best\" tuple is the dominant parastichy pair. This procedure is performed for each test case, and the results are aggregated into the specified output format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef compute_dominant_parastichy(alpha_deg, rho, N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dominant parastichy pair (k1, k2) for a given phyllotactic model.\n\n    Args:\n        alpha_deg (float): The divergence angle in degrees.\n        rho (float): The plastochron ratio.\n        N (int): The number of primordia.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of two integers [k1, k2] representing the dominant pair.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

The problem is a standard exercise in differential geometry and its application to a biological model. It passes all criteria for validity.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nLet the cone be situated in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with its apex at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ and its axis of symmetry aligned with the positive $z$-axis. The half-angle of the cone, the angle between the $z$-axis and any generatrix, is $\\alpha = \\beta/2$.\n\nA point on the surface of the cone at a slant height $\\ell$ from the apex has cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the $z$-axis and $\\theta$ is the azimuthal angle. These coordinates are related to $\\ell$ and $\\alpha$ by:\n$$r = \\ell \\sin(\\alpha)$$\n$$z = \\ell \\cos(\\alpha)$$\nThe circumference of the circular cross-section of the cone at this slant height $\\ell$ is $C = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi \\ell \\sin(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe cone is a developable surface. It can be cut along a generatrix and unrolled onto a plane without stretching or tearing, a process known as isometric development. The resulting planar figure is a sector of a circle. The radius of this circular sector, which we denote $R_{\\text{sector}}$, is equal to the slant height $\\ell$ of the cone. The arc length of this sector, $S_{\\text{sector}}$, must be equal to the circumference $C$ of the cone's base from which it was unrolled. The angle of the sector, which we denote $\\Theta_{\\text{total}}$, is related to its radius and arc length by $S_{\\text{sector}} = R_{\\text{sector}} \\Theta_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nBy preservation of arc length, we have:\n$$S_{\\text{sector}} = C$$\n$$\\ell \\Theta_{\\text{total}} = 2\\pi \\ell \\sin(\\alpha)$$\nSolving for the total angle of the sector gives:\n$$\\Theta_{\\text{total}} = 2\\pi \\sin(\\alpha)$$\nThis fundamental relation establishes the mapping between the geometry of the cone and its planar development. A full revolution in azimuth on the cone, corresponding to an angle of $2\\pi$ radians, maps to an angle of $\\Theta_{\\text{total}} = 2\\pi \\sin(\\alpha)$ radians in the unfolded sector.\n\nThe problem states that the intrinsic divergence increment between two consecutive primordia, $P_n$ and $P_{n+1}$, is a constant angle $\\phi$ when measured in the unfolded plane. Let the angular separation of the primordia in the unfolded plane be $\\Delta\\varphi = \\phi$.\n\nThe effective divergence angle, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the corresponding angular separation in azimuth, $\\Delta\\theta$, on the three-dimensional cone. Due to the linear nature of the isometric mapping between the cone and the planar sector, the ratio of any angular interval in the unfolded plane to the corresponding azimuthal interval on the cone is constant. This ratio is equal to the ratio of the total angles:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{\\Delta\\varphi} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Theta_{\\text{total}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta\\theta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, $\\Delta\\varphi = \\phi$, and $\\Theta_{\\text{total}} = 2\\pi \\sin(\\alpha)$, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{\\delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\phi} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi \\sin(\\alpha)} = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\alpha)}$$\nFrom this, we derive the expression for the effective divergence angle:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\sin(\\alpha)}$$\n\nThe problem specifies the input in terms of the apex angle $\\beta$, where $\\alpha = \\beta/2$. Substituting this into our expression yields:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\sin(\\beta/2)}$$\n\nThe final requirement is to provide the principal value of this angle, which must lie in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. The calculated value of $\\delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ can exceed $2\\pi$, as $\\phi \\in (0, 2\\pi)$ and $\\sin(\\beta/2) \\in (0, 1)$ for $\\beta \\in (0, \\pi)$. To find the principal value, we must compute the result modulo $2\\pi$. For any real number $x$, its value modulo $2\\pi$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ is given by the expression $x - 2\\pi k$, where $k$ is an integer chosen such that $0 \\le x - 2\\pi k < 2\\pi$. This integer is $k = \\lfloor x / (2\\pi) \\rfloor$, where $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ denotes the floor function.\n\nApplying this to our expression for $\\delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we let $x = \\frac{\\phi}{\\sin(\\beta/2)}$.

Retaining leading terms yields\n$$\n\\Delta \\sum_j I''(\\theta_0-\\psi_j) \\approx \\varepsilon \\, e \\left[ 2 \\sin\\!\\big(2(\\theta_0-\\phi)\\big)\\,\\sum_j I(\\theta_0-\\psi_j) \\right].\n$$\nThus\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx \\varepsilon \\, e \\, G \\, \\sin\\!\\big(2(\\theta_0-\\phi)\\big),\n$$\nwith a constant $G = \\frac{2\\sum_j I(\\theta_0-\\psi_j)}{\\sum_j I''(\\theta_0-\\psi_j)}$ determined by the kernel shape and the current phyllotactic state. For sequences dominated by the nearest previous primordium at $\\psi_{j}=\\theta_{\\text{prev}}$, $\\theta_0 - \\psi_j \\approx \\delta_0$, and the dependence on the anisotropy axis enters through the relative angle $\\theta_{\\text{prev}} - \\phi$. Up to a phase shift between sine and cosine determined by $G$ and the expansion point, this predicts that the first-order shift of the divergence angle from its isotropic value is proportional to a quadrupolar function of the misalignment with the anisotropy axis:\n$$\n\\delta - \\delta_0 = \\Delta \\approx \\beta \\, e \\, \\cos\\!\\big(2(\\theta_{\\text{prev}}-\\phi)\\big),\n$$\nfor some coefficient $\\beta$ (absorbing $G$ and the phase). This provides a testable directional signature: deviations should covary with $e$ and with the order-$2$ angular contrast between $\\theta_{\\text{prev}}$ and $\\phi$.\n\nA statistically principled test should therefore:\n- Link deviations of $\\delta_i$ from a baseline angle $\\alpha$ to the measured anisotropy $e_i$ and axis $\\phi_i$ through the predicted quadrupolar coupling to $\\theta_{i-1}$.\n- Account for the circular nature of angular errors (periodicity) using an appropriate noise model such as the von Mises (circular normal) distribution with concentration $\\kappa$.\n- Compare a nested isotropic baseline (no anisotropy coupling) to an anisotropic alternative using a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT), a standard frequentist device for nested models.\n\nConcretely, define a generative model for $\\delta_i$:\n$$\n\\delta_i \\sim \\text{von Mises}\\!\\left(\\mu_i, \\kappa\\right), \\quad \\mu_i = \\alpha + \\beta \\, e_i \\cos\\!\\big(2(\\theta_{i-1}-\\phi_i)\\big) + \\mathbf{z}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\gamma},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the baseline divergence (near the golden angle but estimated from data), $\\beta$ encodes the anisotropy effect predicted above, and $\\mathbf{z}_i$ includes covariates such as meristem radius and plastochron to control for confounds with coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$. The isotropic null sets $\\beta=0$; the anisotropic alternative estimates $\\beta$ freely. The log-likelihood under the von Mises density $f(\\delta \\mid \\mu,\\kappa) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi I_0(\\kappa)} \\exp\\!\\big(\\kappa \\cos(\\delta-\\mu)\\big)$, where $I_0(\\cdot)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order $0$, is\n$$\n\\ell(\\alpha,\\beta,\\boldsymbol{\\gamma},\\kappa) = \\sum_i \\left[ -\\log\\!\\big(2\\pi I_0(\\kappa)\\big) + \\kappa \\cos\\!\\big(\\delta_i - \\mu_i\\big) \\right].\n$$\nMaximization yields $\\hat{\\ell}_{\\text{iso}}$ at $\\beta=0$ and $\\hat{\\ell}_{\\text{aniso}}$ at unconstrained $\\beta$. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) statistic\n$$\n\\Lambda = 2\\big(\\hat{\\ell}_{\\text{aniso}} - \\hat{\\ell}_{\\text{iso}}\\big)\n$$\nis asymptotically $\\chi^2$-distributed with $\\,$$1$ degree of freedom under the null, permitting a significance decision. A sign-consistency check on $\\hat{\\beta}$ relative to the predicted mapping between $e$ and divergence shift provides mechanistic validation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nOption A: This option proposes exactly the mechanistically justified quadrupolar coupling $\\propto e_i \\cos\\!\\big(2(\\theta_{i-1}-\\phi_i)\\big)$ derived above, uses an appropriate circular error model (von Mises), performs a nested maximum-likelihood comparison between an isotropic baseline and an anisotropic alternative via a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT), and controls for covariates such as meristem radius and plastochron. It also requires that the estimated anisotropy coefficient’s sign matches the mechanistic prediction. This directly operationalizes the first-principles derivation and furnishes a rigorous quantitative decision. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: A one-sample $t$-test of the mean divergence angle against $137.5^\\circ$ ignores the directional signature of anisotropy, the dependence on $\\theta_{i-1}$ and $\\phi_i$, the measured ellipticity $e_i$, and the circular nature of the data. A significant difference from the golden angle could arise from multiple causes (e.g., changes in organ size, growth kinetics, or non-anisotropic alterations of the inhibition kernel), and failure to reject does not rule out anisotropy. This does not test the anisotropy mechanism. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: The Rayleigh test checks for non-uniformity of angular data around the circle but, applied to residuals about $137.5^\\circ$, it does not incorporate the predicted order-$2$ coupling to the anisotropy axis or the measured ellipticity. Non-uniform residuals could reflect other structured deviations; uniform residuals do not exclude anisotropy if effects cancel across orientations. This is not a targeted, mechanistically informed test. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Rotating the plant by $90^\\circ$ relative to gravity is a perturbation experiment, but it does not, by itself, quantify the coupling between divergence deviations and the intrinsic anisotropy axis $\\phi$ of the apical dome or distinguish inhibitory field anisotropy from other gravity-dependent processes (e.g., differential growth via gravitropism). Without parametric modeling tied to $\\phi_i$ and $e_i$, this is neither specific nor rigorous as a test of inhibitory field anisotropy explaining the deviation.
