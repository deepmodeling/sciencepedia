It presents a simplified but valid physical model for estimating neural conduction delay, a fundamental concept in neurobiology. The provided parameters for axonal length and conduction velocity are biologically plausible for the vertebrate central nervous system. We will therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation and calculation.\n\nThe task requires us to first derive the general expression for conduction time, or time-of-flight, from the kinematic definition of instantaneous velocity. Let the axonal path be parameterized by the arc length $s$, starting from $s=0$ and ending at a total path length of $s=L$. The instantaneous conduction velocity at any point $s$ along the path is given by $v(s)$. By definition, velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time, $t$. Thus, we can write:\n$$v(s) = \\frac{ds}{dt}$$\nOur goal is to find the total time $T$ required to traverse the entire path. We can rearrange the differential equation to solve for the infinitesimal time element $dt$ required to traverse an infinitesimal path element $ds$:\n$$dt = \\frac{ds}{v(s)}$$\nTo find the total time $T$, we must integrate this expression over the entire path, from the starting point $s=0$ to the end point $s=L$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all terms are defined with sufficient precision to permit a unique analytical solution. The model, while a simplification, is based on standard principles of receptor kinetics and established neurobiology of the basal ganglia.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we state the given definitions for dopamine receptor occupancy, $O(D)$, and action vigor, $V(D)$. The fraction of occupied receptors at a dopamine concentration $D$ is given by the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$\nO(D) = \\frac{D}{D+K}\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the dissociation constant. Action vigor $V(D)$ is directly proportional to this occupancy, with a proportionality constant $k$:\n$$\nV(D) = k \\cdot O(D) = k \\frac{D}{D+K}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the ratio $R$ of the vigor after a dopamine lesion to the baseline vigor. The baseline dopamine concentration is $D_{0}$, and the corresponding baseline vigor is $V(D_{0})$:\n$$\nV(D_{0}) = k \\frac{D_0}{D_0+K}\n$$\n\nAfter the lesion, the dopamine concentration is reduced to a fraction $q = \\frac{2}{5}$ of the baseline, resulting in a new concentration $q D_{0}$.

To achieve this, we divide both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction in the expression for $R$ by the dissociation constant $K$:\n$$\nR = q \\frac{\\frac{D_0+K}{K}}{\\frac{q D_0 + K}{K}} = q \\frac{\\frac{D_0}{K} + \\frac{K}{K}}{q\\frac{D_0}{K} + \\frac{K}{K}}\n$$\nSubstituting $r=\\frac{D_0}{K}$, this becomes:\n$$\nR(r) = q \\frac{r+1}{qr+1}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical value for the reduction factor, $q = \\frac{2}{5}$:\n$$\nR(r) = \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{r+1}{\\frac{2}{5} r + 1}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression into a single rational function, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $5$:\n$$\nR(r) = \\frac{2(r+1)}{5 \\left( \\frac{2}{5} r + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{2(r+1)}{2r+5}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the normalized vigor $R$ as a function of the dimensionless operating point $r$.\n\nThe relevance of this mapping to hypokinesia, the reduction in movement vigor characteristic of Parkinson's disease, is profound. The basal ganglia circuit and its dopaminergic modulation are deeply conserved across vertebrates. This model, though simple, captures the essential non-linear relationship between dopamine concentration and its effect on circuit output. The expression for $R(r)$ demonstrates that the behavioral consequence of a fixed fractional drop in dopamine ($q=\\frac{2}{5}$) is not uniform; it critically depends on the baseline operating point $r = D_0/K$. If the system operates at low receptor occupancy ($r \\ll 1$, i.e., $D_0 \\ll K$), then $R(r) \\approx \\frac{2(1)}{5} = \\frac{2}{5} = q$. In this regime, vigor decreases almost proportionally to the drop in dopamine. Conversely, if the system operates near saturation ($r \\gg 1$, i.e., $D_0 \\gg K$), then $R(r) \\approx \\frac{2r}{2r} = 1$. In this case, the system is robust, and the same fractional drop in dopamine has a much smaller effect on vigor. This non-linearity, where the functional impact of dopamine loss depends on the baseline state, is a fundamental property that explains the variable presentation of motor symptoms. Because the underlying circuit is conserved, this principle provides a quantitative and generalizable basis for understanding hypokinesia across different vertebrate species.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2(r+1)}{2r+5}}\n$$", "id": "2559525"}]}
