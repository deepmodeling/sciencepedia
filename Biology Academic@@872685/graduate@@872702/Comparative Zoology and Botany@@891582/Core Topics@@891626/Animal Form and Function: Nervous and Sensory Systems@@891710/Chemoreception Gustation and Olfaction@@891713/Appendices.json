This rapid response time, on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, indicates that the chemosensory system is well-equipped to detect and track fast fluctuations in ligand concentration. For an olfactory neuron, this allows for the resolution of concentration changes within a turbulent odor plume, which is critical for source localization.

The dissociation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, dictates that the average lifetime of a receptor-ligand complex is $1$ second. This permits the signal to terminate quickly once the stimulus is removed, preventing signal saturation and allowing the system to reset promptly for subsequent detection events.
