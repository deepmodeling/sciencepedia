This exercise explores the fundamental electrical response of a vertebrate photoreceptor, which, unlike its arthropod counterpart, hyperpolarizes in response to light.

Consider a vertebrate rod photoreceptor in darkness held near an intracellular potential of $-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ by a steady inward “dark current” carried through Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated (CNG) channels. Upon a steady light step, CNG channels close so that the inward current is reduced by $20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$. Assume that over this operating range the cell behaves as a passive element with a constant input resistance and that steady-state changes obey the definition of input resistance.\n\nStarting from the definition of input resistance as the ratio of steady-state change in membrane potential to the change in membrane current, and using the intracellular potential convention $V_{m} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ with inward current defined as positive (positive charge entering the cell), determine the change in membrane potential $\\Delta V_{m}$ for an input resistance of $200\\ \\mathrm{M}\\Omega$. Express your final answer for $\\Delta V_{m}$ in $\\mathrm{mV}$ and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_{m}$, for a vertebrate rod photoreceptor upon exposure to light. The solution must be derived from the stated definition of input resistance and adhere to the given sign conventions.\n\nThe problem states that input resistance, $R_{in}$, is defined as the ratio of the steady-state change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_{m}$, to the change in membrane current, $\\Delta I_{m}$. This relationship is mathematically expressed as:\n$$R_{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{m}}{\\Delta I_{m}}$$\nThis is a form of Ohm's Law. To find the change in membrane potential, we rearrange this equation:\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = R_{in} \\cdot \\Delta I_{m}$$\nWe are provided with the following values:\nThe input resistance is $R_{in} = 200\\ \\mathrm{M}\\Omega$.\nThe light stimulus causes the inward current to be reduced by $20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nWe must carefully determine the sign of the change in current, $\\Delta I_{m}$, based on the provided conventions. The problem specifies that inward current, which corresponds to positive charge entering the cell, is defined as positive.\nLet $I_{dark}$ be the steady-state inward current in darkness. According to the convention, $I_{dark}$ is a positive value.\nUpon illumination, this inward current is reduced. Let the new steady-state current in the light be $I_{light}$. The reduction is given as $20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$. Therefore:\n$$I_{light} = I_{dark} - 20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$$\nThe change in membrane current, $\\Delta I_{m}$, is the final current minus the initial current:\n$$\\Delta I_{m} = I_{light} - I_{dark}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{light}$:\n$$\\Delta I_{m} = (I_{dark} - 20\\ \\mathrm{pA}) - I_{dark} = -20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$$\nThus, the change in current is $\\Delta I_{m} = -20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$. This negative sign indicates a decrease in the inward (positive) current, which is consistent with the problem description.\n\nNow we can calculate $\\Delta V_{m}$. It is imperative to use SI units for a consistent calculation. We convert the given values:\nInput resistance: $R_{in} = 200\\ \\mathrm{M}\\Omega = 200 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\Omega$.\nChange in current: $\\Delta I_{m} = -20\\ \\mathrm{pA} = -20 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the rearranged Ohm's Law:\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = (200 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\Omega) \\times (-20 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A})$$\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -(200 \\times 20) \\times (10^{6} \\times 10^{-12})\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -4000 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$). Since $1\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, we have:\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -4.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{mV} = -4.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe problem also specifies that the final answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $-4.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ must be written as $-4.00\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ to satisfy this requirement.\n\nThis result is physiologically consistent. The initial membrane potential is given as near $-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. A change of $-4.00\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ results in a final potential of approximately $-44\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. This decrease in potential (becoming more negative) is termed hyperpolarization, which is the characteristic response of vertebrate photoreceptors to light.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-4.00}$$", "id": "2596532"}, {"introduction": "A high-resolution camera-type eye, whether in a cephalopod or a vertebrate, must efficiently match its optics to its sensor array.

Report $R$ as a pure number (dimensionless) and round your answer to three significant figures.\n\nBackground context: In comparative zoology and botany, camera-type eyes differ from the compound eyes of arthropods in that retinal sampling and optics interact through image formation and sampling on a continuous image plane, rather than through many individual ommatidia. Here you will quantify which stage is the tighter limit under the given parameters by comparing sampling and optical cutoffs without converting to angular units.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the analysis. The task is to compute the ratio $R$ of the retinal sampling Nyquist spatial frequency, $\\nu_{\\text{Nyquist}}$, to the optical Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) cutoff spatial frequency, $\\nu_{\\text{cutoff}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Nyquist spatial frequency, $\\nu_{\\text{Nyquist}}$, of the photoreceptor mosaic. The sampling theorem dictates that the Nyquist frequency is one-half of the sampling rate. For a discrete spatial sampling system, the sampling rate is the reciprocal of the sampling interval. Here, the sampling interval is the foveal cone inner-center spacing, given as $s$.\n\nThe sampling interval is $s = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We must express this in millimeters to obtain the final frequency in cycles per millimeter as requested.\n$$s = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe Nyquist frequency is therefore given by the formula:\n$$\\nu_{\\text{Nyquist}} = \\frac{1}{2s}$$\nSubstituting the value of $s$:\n$$\\nu_{\\text{Nyquist}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm})} = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 200\\,\\text{cycles/mm}$$\n\nNext, we determine the optical cutoff frequency, $\\nu_{\\text{cutoff}}$, for a diffraction-limited system with a circular pupil. According to scalar diffraction theory, the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of such a system becomes zero at a specific cutoff spatial frequency. This frequency, expressed in the image plane (the retina), depends on the pupil diameter $D$, the wavelength of light $\\lambda$, and the effective focal length of the optical system $f$.\n\nThe formula for the spatial cutoff frequency in the image plane is:\n$$\\nu_{\\text{cutoff}} = \\frac{D}{\\lambda f}$$\nWe are given the following parameters:\nPupil diameter, $D = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nDominant wavelength, $\\lambda = 550\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nEffective focal length, $f = 17\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nWe must ensure all units are consistent.
