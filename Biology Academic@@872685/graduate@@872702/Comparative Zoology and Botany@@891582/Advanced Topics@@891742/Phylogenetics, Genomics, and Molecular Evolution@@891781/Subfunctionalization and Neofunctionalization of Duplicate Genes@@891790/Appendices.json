The team is tempted to infer neofunctionalization whenever one paralog shows elevated $d_N/d_S$ and large expression divergence relative to its sister copy, pooling evidence across both lineages to seek convergent trends in animals and plants.\n\nFrom first principles, recall that: (i) under the neutral theory of molecular evolution, synonymous sites are approximately neutral so that $d_S$ reflects the neutral substitution rate, whereas $d_N$ is constrained by purifying selection and can be accelerated by positive selection; (ii) positive selection on protein function can produce $d_N/d_S  1$, while relaxed purifying selection can cause $d_N/d_S$ to increase toward $1$ without exceeding it; (iii) gene expression levels are products of regulatory sequences and trans-acting factors under selection for cellular function, and reductions in functional constraint (e.g., duplicate genes sharing ancestral tasks or dosage-sharing) can increase expression divergence without requiring acquisition of a new function. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA to RNA to protein) implies that changes at the sequence level and changes at the expression level can both impact organismal function, but the mapping from genotype to phenotype is many-to-one and context dependent.\n\nConsider the risk of circular reasoning when using both $d_N/d_S$ and expression divergence simultaneously to diagnose neofunctionalization, given that both statistics can respond to the same underlying change in selective constraint after duplication.

Point out that selecting foreground branches for branch-site tests of $d_N/d_S$ based on large $1 - \\rho$ violates independence and inflates false positives because both measures can reflect relaxed constraint; then validate neofunctionalization by combining a McDonald–Kreitman (MK) style test that compares nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism and divergence within the focal species to detect an excess of fixed adaptive changes after duplication, together with reciprocal hemizygosity or CRISPR knockout assays across environments to test for a novel, nonredundant phenotype unique to one paralog.\n\nB. Argue that elevated $d_N/d_S$ and large $1 - \\rho$ are independent by definition because one concerns coding sequence and the other regulatory sequence, so combining them is conservative; then validate by showing that the codon adaptation index increases in the putative neofunctionalized paralog, indicating selection on translation efficiency.\n\nC. Note that inability of the two paralogs to cross-rescue each other’s loss-of-function in a heterologous species implies neofunctionalization independent of $d_N/d_S$ or expression; therefore, first screen for pairs with high $d_N/d_S$ and large $1 - \\rho$, and then perform cross-species complementation as validation.\n\nD.

The core issue is the use of two correlated statistics, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates ($d_N/d_S$) and expression divergence ($1-\\rho$), to infer neofunctionalization of duplicate genes.\n\nThe logical flaw in the proposed method lies in a confounding variable: relaxed purifying selection. After gene duplication, redundancy can lead to a relaxation of purifying selection, which can simultaneously cause an increase in the $d_N/d_S$ ratio (towards 1) and an increase in expression divergence ($1-\\rho$). Therefore, observing both signals is not independent evidence of *positive selection* for a new function (neofunctionalization); it could simply be two correlated consequences of relaxed constraint. Using one to corroborate the other is a form of circular reasoning. A valid, orthogonal validation strategy must test for a consequence of positive selection that is not expected under relaxed constraint alone.\n\n**Option A:** This option correctly identifies the circularity: selecting on high $1 - \\rho$ inflates false positives because \"both measures can reflect relaxed constraint.\" It then proposes a two-pronged validation. First, a McDonald–Kreitman (MK) style test, which can distinguish recurrent positive selection from relaxed constraint by comparing within-species polymorphism to between-species divergence. Second, it suggests \"reciprocal hemizygosity or CRISPR knockout assays,\" which are direct functional tests at the organismal level. Demonstrating a novel, non-redundant phenotype is the gold standard for proving neofunctionalization.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Option B:** This option incorrectly claims independence. While the metrics concern different parts of the gene, they are not independent from an evolutionary perspective as they can both be driven by the same change in selective pressure. The proposed validation, an increase in the codon adaptation index (CAI), indicates selection on translational efficiency, not necessarily a novel protein function.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** This option fails to critique the flawed initial screening method. Its validation, \"cross-rescue\" in a \"heterologous species,\" is problematic. Failure to rescue may be due to artifacts of the foreign cellular environment (e.g., improper folding, missing co-factors) rather than true functional divergence.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** This option provides a very precise diagnosis of the logical flaw, describing it as \"'double-dipping' on a common latent variable (functional constraint).\" It proposes a two-part orthogonal validation. First, biochemical assays (measuring substrate specificity or new interaction partners) provide a direct test of novel function at the molecular level. Second, it suggests a sophisticated, polymorphism-aware test (e.g., the extended MK framework) to robustly distinguish positive selection from relaxed constraint by modeling demography. Crucially, it recommends applying these tests without pre-selecting based on expression divergence, which directly avoids the circular reasoning.
