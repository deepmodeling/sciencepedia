A simple regression of Trait B against Trait A across 30 different species shows a strong positive correlation, suggesting that species with longer hindlimbs tend to use wider perches.\n\nHowever, the biologist recognizes that these species are not independent data points due to their shared evolutionary history. To correctly test for an evolutionary association, the biologist employs the method of Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts (PIC). This method calculates a set of statistically independent values representing the magnitude and direction of evolutionary changes for each trait throughout the phylogeny.\n\nAfter calculating the standardized contrasts for both traits based on a well-resolved molecular phylogeny, the biologist plots the contrasts of Trait B against the contrasts of Trait A. The resulting scatter plot shows a cloud of points randomly scattered around the origin (0,0). A formal linear regression analysis of these contrasts yields a correlation coefficient of $r = 0.05$ with a p-value of $p = 0.79$.\n\nBased on this result from the Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts analysis, what is the most appropriate conclusion about the evolutionary relationship between hindlimb length and perch diameter in this group of lizards?\n\nA. The two traits are evolving independently of each other.\n\nB.

All necessary data, including the phylogeny, branch lengths, and trait values, are provided, and the computational procedure is specified unambiguously. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the slope of a regression through the origin between the phylogenetic independent contrasts of two traits, $Y$ and $X$. The method, developed by Felsenstein, transforms species data into a set of independent values, accounting for their shared evolutionary history as described by a phylogeny. The process is executed recursively from the tips of the tree to the root.\n\nThe phylogeny is given by the Newick string $((A:0.5,B:0.5):0.6,(C:0.4,D:0.4):0.6)$. Let us denote the internal nodes as follows: $N_1$ is the most recent common ancestor of taxa $A$ and $B$, $N_2$ is the most recent common ancestor of taxa $C$ and $D$, and $R$ is the root of the tree, the ancestor of $N_1$ and $N_2$.\nThe branch lengths are: $v_A = 0.5$, $v_B = 0.5$, $v_{N_1} = 0.6$ (leading from $R$ to $N_1$), $v_C = 0.4$, $v_D = 0.4$, and $v_{N_2} = 0.6$ (leading from $R$ to $N_2$).\nThe trait values are:\n$X_A=2.3$, $X_B=2.0$, $X_C=1.5$, $X_D=1.7$\n$Y_A=1.8$, $Y_B=1.6$, $Y_C=1.2$, $Y_D=1.35$\n\nWe proceed by calculating a standardized contrast at each of the $n-1=3$ internal nodes, for both traits $X$ and $Y$.\n\n**Step 1: Contrast at Node $N_1$ (ancestor of A and B)**\nThe contrast is defined as the difference between the trait values of the two descendant lineages, standardized by the expected variance of this difference, which is the sum of their branch lengths. The orientation is specified as left-minus-right, so $A$ minus $B$.\n\nFor trait $X$:\nThe raw contrast is $C_{X,1} = X_A - X_B = 2.3 - 2.0 = 0.3$.\nThe variance is $v_A + v_B = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0$.\nThe standardized contrast is $PIC_{X,1} = \\frac{C_{X,1}}{\\sqrt{v_A + v_B}} = \\frac{0.3}{\\sqrt{1.0}} = 0.3 = \\frac{3}{10}$.\n\nFor trait $Y$:\nThe raw contrast is $C_{Y,1} = Y_A - Y_B = 1.8 - 1.6 = 0.2$.\nThe variance is $v_A + v_B = 1.0$.\nThe standardized contrast is $PIC_{Y,1} = \\frac{C_{Y,1}}{\\sqrt{v_A + v_B}} = \\frac{0.2}{\\sqrt{1.0}} = 0.2 = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nNext, we estimate the trait values at node $N_1$ using an inverse-variance weighted average. The weight for a descendant is the inverse of its branch length.\n$X_{N_1} = \\frac{X_A/v_A + X_B/v_B}{1/v_A + 1/v_B} = \\frac{2.3/0.5 + 2.0/0.5}{1/0.5 + 1/0.5} = \\frac{4.6 + 4.0}{2.0 + 2.0} = \\frac{8.6}{4.0} = 2.15 = \\frac{43}{20}$.\n$Y_{N_1} = \\frac{Y_A/v_A + Y_B/v_B}{1/v_A + 1/v_B} = \\frac{1.8/0.5 + 1.6/0.5}{1/0.5 + 1/0.5} = \\frac{3.6 + 3.2}{4.0} = \\frac{6.8}{4.0} = 1.7 = \\frac{17}{10}$.\n\nThe branch length for node $N_1$ is updated by adding the variance of its estimated state. This variance is $\\frac{v_A v_B}{v_A + v_B} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 0.5}{0.5+0.5} = 0.25$.\nThe new, effective branch length for $N_1$ is $v'_{N_1} = v_{N_1} + \\frac{v_A v_B}{v_A+v_B} = 0.6 + 0.25 = 0.85 = \\frac{17}{20}$.\n\n**Step 2: Contrast at Node $N_2$ (ancestor of C and D)**\nSimilarly, for the node connecting $C$ and $D$. The orientation is $C$ minus $D$.\n\nFor trait $X$:\n$C_{X,2} = X_C - X_D = 1.5 - 1.7 = -0.2$.\n$v_C + v_D = 0.4 + 0.4 = 0.8$.\n$PIC_{X,2} = \\frac{-0.2}{\\sqrt{0.8}} = \\frac{-0.2}{\\sqrt{4/5}} = \\frac{-0.2 \\sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.1\\sqrt{5} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{10}$.\n\nFor trait $Y$:\n$C_{Y,2} = Y_C - Y_D = 1.2 - 1.35 = -0.15$.\n$PIC_{Y,2} = \\frac{-0.15}{\\sqrt{0.8}} = \\frac{-0.15 \\sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.075\\sqrt{5} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{40}$.\n\nThe state estimates at node $N_2$:\n$X_{N_2} = \\frac{X_C/v_C + X_D/v_D}{1/v_C + 1/v_D} = \\frac{1.5/0.4 + 1.7/0.4}{1/0.4 + 1/0.4} = \\frac{1.5+1.7}{2} = 1.6 = \\frac{8}{5}$.\n$Y_{N_2} = \\frac{Y_C/v_C + Y_D/v_D}{1/v_C + 1/v_D} = \\frac{1.2/0.4 + 1.35/0.4}{1/0.4 + 1/0.4} = \\frac{1.2+1.35}{2} = \\frac{2.55}{2} = 1.275 = \\frac{51}{40}$.\n\nThe new branch length for $N_2$ is $v'_{N_2} = v_{N_2} + \\frac{v_C v_D}{v_C+v_D} = 0.6 + \\frac{0.4 \\times 0.4}{0.4+0.4} = 0.6 + \\frac{0.16}{0.8} = 0.6 + 0.2 = 0.8 = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n**Step 3: Contrast at the Root Node $R$ (ancestor of $N_1$ and $N_2$)**\nThe final contrast is calculated between the estimated states at nodes $N_1$ and $N_2$, using their updated branch lengths $v'_{N_1}$ and $v'_{N_2}$. The orientation is clade $(A,B)$ left of $(C,D)$, so $N_1$ minus $N_2$.\n\nFor trait $X$:\n$C_{X,3} = X_{N_1} - X_{N_2} = 2.15 - 1.6 = 0.55 = \\frac{11}{20}$.\nThe variance is $v'_{N_1} + v'_{N_2} = 0.85 + 0.8 = 1.65 = \\frac{33}{20}$.\n$PIC_{X,3} = \\frac{0.55}{\\sqrt{1.65}} = \\frac{11/20}{\\sqrt{33/20}}$.\n\nFor trait $Y$:\n$C_{Y,3} = Y_{N_1} - Y_{N_2} = 1.7 - 1.275 = 0.425 = \\frac{17}{40}$.\n$PIC_{Y,3} = \\frac{0.425}{\\sqrt{1.65}} = \\frac{17/40}{\\sqrt{33/20}}$.\n\n**Step 4: Regression through the Origin**\nWe have three pairs of standardized contrasts $(c_{X,i}, c_{Y,i})$ for $i=1, 2, 3$:\n1. $(c_{X,1}, c_{Y,1}) = (\\frac{3}{10}, \\frac{1}{5})$\n2. $(c_{X,2}, c_{Y,2}) = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{10}, -\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{40})$\n3. $(c_{X,3}, c_{Y,3}) = (\\frac{11/20}{\\sqrt{33/20}}, \\frac{17/40}{\\sqrt{33/20}})$\n\nThe slope $\\beta$ of a regression of $Y$ on $X$ through the origin is given by the formula:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_{X,i} c_{Y,i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_{X,i}^2} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the products $\\sum c_{X,i} c_{Y,i}$:\n$c_{X,1} c_{Y,1} = (\\frac{3}{10})(\\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{3}{50}$.\n$c_{X,2} c_{Y,2} = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{10})(-\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{40}) = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{400} = \\frac{15}{400} = \\frac{3}{80}$.\n$c_{X,3} c_{Y,3} = \\frac{(11/20)(17/40)}{(\\sqrt{33/20})^2} = \\frac{11 \\times 17}{20 \\times 40} \\times \\frac{20}{33} = \\frac{11 \\times 17}{40 \\times 33} = \\frac{17}{40 \\times 3} = \\frac{17}{120}$.\n$\\sum c_{X,i} c_{Y,i} = \\frac{3}{50} + \\frac{3}{80} + \\frac{17}{120} = \\frac{72}{1200} + \\frac{45}{1200} + \\frac{170}{1200} = \\frac{287}{1200}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of squares $\\sum c_{X,i}^2$:\n$c_{X,1}^2 = (\\frac{3}{10})^2 = \\frac{9}{100}$.\n$c_{X,2}^2 = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{10})^2 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$.\n$c_{X,3}^2 = \\frac{(11/20)^2}{33/20} = \\frac{121/400}{33/20} = \\frac{121}{400} \\times \\frac{20}{33} = \\frac{11}{20 \\times 3} = \\frac{11}{60}$.\n$\\sum c_{X,i}^2 = \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{11}{60} = \\frac{27}{300} + \\frac{15}{300} + \\frac{55}{300} = \\frac{97}{300}$.\n\nFinally, the estimated slope $\\beta$ is the ratio of these two sums:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{287/1200}{97/300} = \\frac{287}{1200} \\times \\frac{300}{97} = \\frac{287}{4 \\times 97} = \\frac{287}{388} $$\nThe number $97$ is prime.

The framework is the Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution.\n\nFirst, let us state the fundamental principles. Under a simple Brownian motion model of trait evolution with a diffusion rate of $\\sigma^2$, the values of a trait at the tips of a phylogeny are not statistically independent. The method of Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts (PIC) transforms these tip data into a set of standardized, independent variables. For any pair of sister lineages, $i$ and $j$, descending from a common node with respective branch lengths $v_i$ and $v_j$, the standardized contrast is given by:\n$$ C_{ij} = \\frac{x_i - x_j}{\\sqrt{v_i + v_j}} $$\nThe expectation of the variance of this contrast is $E[Var(C_{ij})] = \\sigma^2$. This standardization ensures that all contrasts are drawn from the same distribution (a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$), which is a prerequisite for subsequent statistical analyses like regression.\n\nThe problem arises when $v_i + v_j = 0$, as in the case presented where $v_A = 0$ and $v_B = 0$. The standard formula denominator becomes zero, rendering the calculation undefined. A statistically rigorous solution must resolve this issue without resorting to arbitrary modifications.\n\nThe problem statement provides the key: \"sampling or measurement error at the tips contributes additively to the variance of observed tip values.\" Let the observed trait mean for species $i$ be $x_i$, the \"true\" but unknown evolutionary value of the trait be $\\mu_i$, and the sampling error be $e_i$. The model for the observed data is:\n$$ x_i = \\mu_i + e_i $$\nThe error term $e_i$ is a random variable with mean $E[e_i] = 0$ and variance $Var(e_i) = s_i^2$, where $s_i^2$ is the given within-species sampling variance. The evolutionary values $\\mu_A$ and $\\mu_B$ evolve according to the BM process.\n\nWe are interested in the variance of the difference between the observed trait values, $x_A - x_B$.\n$$ x_A - x_B = (\\mu_A + e_A) - (\\mu_B + e_B) = (\\mu_A - \\mu_B) + (e_A - e_B) $$\nAs the evolutionary process and sampling error are independent, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$ Var(x_A - x_B) = Var(\\mu_A - \\mu_B) + Var(e_A - e_B) $$\nThe first term is the variance of the difference in the true evolutionary values. Under BM, this is $Var(\\mu_A - \\mu_B) = \\sigma^2(v_A + v_B)$.\nThe second term is the variance of the difference in sampling errors. Assuming the sampling errors for different species are independent, this is $Var(e_A - e_B) = Var(e_A) + Var(e_B) = s_A^2 + s_B^2$.\n\nCombining these, the total variance of the observed difference is:\n$$ Var(x_A - x_B) = \\sigma^2(v_A + v_B) + s_A^2 + s_B^2 $$\nNow we apply the specific conditions of the problem: $v_A = 0$ and $v_B = 0$.\n$$ Var(x_A - x_B) = \\sigma^2(0 + 0) + s_A^2 + s_B^2 = s_A^2 + s_B^2 $$\nThis result is crucial. It demonstrates that when there is no evolutionary divergence between two lineages ($v_A+v_B = 0$), the entire variance of the difference between their measured traits is due to sampling error.\n\nTo \"standardize\" the difference $x_A - x_B$, one must divide it by its standard deviation. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\text{SD}(x_A - x_B) = \\sqrt{s_A^2 + s_B^2} $$\nTherefore, the correctly formulated standardized value, which accounts for all sources of variation provided in the problem, is:\n$$ \\frac{x_A - x_B}{\\sqrt{s_A^2 + s_B^2}} $$\nThis quantity is a random variable with an expected mean of $0$ and a variance of exactly $1$. While other contrasts from the tree will have a variance of $\\sigma^2$, this particular value is correctly standardized according to its own variance structure. Any subsequent analysis, such as a regression, would need to account for this heterogeneity of variances (e.g., using weighted least squares), but the calculation of the contrast itself is statistically sound.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. Add a small constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ to every zero or near-zero branch, then compute the standardized contrast for $\\{A,B\\}$ as $\\dfrac{x_{A} - x_{B}}{\\sqrt{2\\varepsilon}}$.\nThis is an ad-hoc, arbitrary fix. The choice of $\\varepsilon$ is subjective and will influence the value of the contrast and any subsequent analyses. More importantly, this method completely ignores the known information about the sampling variances $s_A^2$ and $s_B^2$, which provide a non-arbitrary, statistical basis for the variance calculation. Throwing away known data in favor of an arbitrary constant is not a statistically justified procedure.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. Incorporate tip-specific observation error by augmenting the terminal variances, leaving $v_{A} = 0$ and $v_{B} = 0$ unchanged; the standardized contrast for $\\{A,B\\}$ is $\\dfrac{x_{A} - x_{B}}{\\sqrt{s_{A}^{2} + s_{B}^{2}}}$.\nThis option's method and result are in exact agreement with our derivation from first principles. It correctly identifies that the total variance of the difference $x_A - x_B$ is composed solely of the sampling variances when the phylogenetic branch lengths are zero. The division by the standard deviation $\\sqrt{s_A^2 + s_B^2}$ is the correct procedure for standardization. The phrase \"augmenting the terminal variances\" correctly describes the conceptual step of adding the sampling variance to the phylogenetic variance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Assign small negative branch lengths $-\\delta$ with $\\delta > 0$ to replace zero branches so that denominators are nonzero; the standardized contrast for $\\{A,B\\}$ is $\\dfrac{x_{A} - x_{B}}{\\sqrt{-2\\delta}}$.\nThis suggestion is scientifically and mathematically nonsensical. In the context of Brownian motion, branch lengths are proportional to time and variance. Neither can be negative. A negative variance is an undefined concept. Furthermore, this would require taking the square root of a negative number, $\\sqrt{-2\\delta}$, yielding an imaginary number which has no meaningful interpretation in this statistical context.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Prune one of the two tips $\\{A,B\\}$ at random to eliminate the zero-length terminal branch and proceed with PIC on the reduced tree; the contrast for $\\{A,B\\}$ is unnecessary because only a single descendant remains.\nThis approach involves the willful destruction of data. The measurements $x_A$ and $x_B$ and their associated variances $s_A^2$ and $s_B^2$ contain valid information. Discarding one of the tips is statistically inefficient and unjustifiable. The pair $\\{A, B\\}$, despite zero evolutionary divergence, provides an independent data point reflecting non-phylogenetic variation, which can and should be incorporated into the analysis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE.

First, the Pagel's $\\lambda$ model is a method for testing for phylogenetic signal; it is not a tool designed for fixing computational problems arising from zero branch lengths. Second, the $\\lambda$ transformation does not alter the fact that $v_A=0$ and $v_B=0$. Therefore, the denominator $\\sqrt{v_A+v_B}$ remains $\\sqrt{0}=0$, and the expression is not \"well-defined\" as claimed.
