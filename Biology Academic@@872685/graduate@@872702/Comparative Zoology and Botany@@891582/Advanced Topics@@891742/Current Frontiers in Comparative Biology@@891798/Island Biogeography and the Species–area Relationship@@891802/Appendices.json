It is necessary to ensure the divisor is non-zero. Since $I_{0}$, $M$, and $e_{1}$ are rates or pool sizes, they are non-negative. The given values confirm they are strictly positive, so the divisor is positive.\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{I_{0} - e_{0}}{\\frac{I_{0}}{M} + e_{1}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $M$:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{M(I_{0} - e_{0})}{M\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{M} + e_{1}\\right)} = \\frac{M(I_{0} - e_{0})}{I_{0} + Me_{1}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the equilibrium species richness $S^{\\ast}$.\n\n(b) Evaluation of $S^{\\ast}$ for the given parameters.\nThe given parameter values are $I_{0}=30$, $M=200$, $e_{0}=1$, and $e_{1}=0.1$.

Derive an expression for the expected fraction of species committed to extinction as a function of the cleared fraction $p$ by integrating over the range-size distribution.

If $O  p$, containment is impossible and the extinction probability is $0$. If $O \\leq p$, containment occurs when the start point of the species’ range lies within a sub-arc of the cleared arc of length $p - O$, so the extinction probability is $p - O$.

That is a measure of local richness reduction, not of global extinctions. By contrast, the endemics–area framework counts only species whose entire contiguous ranges are fully contained within the cleared area, which is a stricter criterion. Because many species with ranges intersecting both the cleared and retained areas will still persist globally (even though they may be absent from the specific retained sample if it is small), it follows that the SAR-based projection generally exceeds the endemics-based extinction probability. In our geometric model, this is captured by the fact that $\\Pr\\{\\text{extinction} \\mid O\\} \\leq p$ for all $O$, and the integral against $f_{O}$ yields $\\mathrm{EAR}(p)$ that grows like $p^{3}$ for small $p$, whereas the SAR loss grows like $z p$ for small $p$, so for sufficiently small $p$ one has $F(p;z) \\sim (z p)/(p^{3})$ which is large, and more generally $F(p;z) \\geq 1$ across a broad range of $p$ for moderate $z$ under this contiguous-range model.\n\nFinally, evaluate at $p = \\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $z = 0.25$:\n- The endemics–area extinction fraction is\n$$\n\\mathrm{EAR}\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{3}{32} = 0.09375.\n$$\n- The SAR loss fraction is\n$$\n\\mathrm{SAR\\_loss}\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{0.25} = 1 - 2^{-1/4} \\approx 1 - 0.8408964153 = 0.1591035847.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nF\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}; 0.25\\right) = \\frac{1 - 2^{-1/4}}{3/32} = \\frac{32}{3}\\left(1 - 2^{-1/4}\\right) \\approx 1.69710490396.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the overestimation factor is $1.697$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.697}$$", "id": "2583879"}]}
