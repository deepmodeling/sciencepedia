All concepts, such as effective population size, deep coalescence, and reciprocal monophyly, are standard and well-defined within the field. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary parameters ($T$, $N_{e}$, $n_{A}$, $n_{B}$) and clear definitions required to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and technical. The given values are physically plausible within a theoretical context. The problem is a standard application of coalescent theory and is neither trivial nor self-contradictory.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Expected Number of Deep Coalescences**\n\nWe are considering a single neutral locus in a diploid population. According to the standard neutral coalescent model, the time to coalescence for a pair of lineages ($k=2$) follows an exponential distribution. The rate of coalescence for $k$ lineages is $\\lambda_k = \\frac{\\binom{k}{2}}{2N_e}$. For $k=2$ lineages, this rate is $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{\\binom{2}{2}}{2N_e} = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. The time to coalescence, $t_{coal}$, is therefore a random variable with distribution $t_{coal} \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\frac{1}{2N_e})$.\n\nA \"deep coalescence\" for a given species is defined as the event that the sampled lineages fail to coalesce within the time interval $[0, T]$, which means the coalescence time $t_{coal}$ is greater than $T$.\n\nConsider species A, from which $n_{A}=2$ lineages are sampled. The population size is $N_e$. The probability of a deep coalescence in species A, denoted $P(D_{A})$, is the probability that the two lineages do not coalesce by time $T$:\n$$ P(D_{A}) = P(t_{coal, A} > T) $$\nFor an exponentially distributed random variable with rate $\\lambda$, the survival function is $P(X > x) = \\exp(-\\lambda x)$. Here, $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$ and $x = T$.\n$$ P(D_{A}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right) $$\nLet $D_A$ be an indicator random variable that is $1$ if a deep coalescence occurs in species A and $0$ otherwise. The expected value of this indicator variable is simply the probability of the event:\n$$ E[D_A] = 1 \\cdot P(D_A=1) + 0 \\cdot P(D_A=0) = P(D_A=1) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right) $$\nThe situation for species B is identical, with $n_B=2$ and population size $N_e$. Therefore, the expected number of deep coalescences for species B is:\n$$ E[D_B] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right) $$\nThe total number of deep coalescences is the sum of the deep coalescences in each species, $D_{total} = D_A + D_B$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of deep coalescences is:\n$$ E[D_{total}] = E[D_A + D_B] = E[D_A] + E[D_B] = 2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right) $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Probability of Reciprocal Monophyly**\n\nReciprocal monophyly within the time window $[0, T]$ is the event where the lineages within species A coalesce before time $T$, AND the lineages within species B coalesce before time $T$. This is equivalent to the event of having zero deep coalescences.\n\nLet $M_A$ be the event that the lineages in species A are monophyletic within $[0, T]$. This occurs if their coalescence time $t_{coal, A}$ is less than or equal to $T$. This is the complement of a deep coalescence event.\n$$ P(M_A) = P(t_{coal, A} \\le T) = 1 - P(t_{coal, A} > T) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right) $$\nSimilarly, for species B, the probability of monophyly within $[0, T]$ is:\n$$ P(M_B) = P(t_{coal, B} \\le T) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right) $$\nThe problem states there has been no gene flow since divergence. This means the coalescent processes in the two descendant populations are independent events. The probability of reciprocal monophyly, $P(RM)$, is the probability that both events $M_A$ and $M_B$ occur.\n$$ P(RM) = P(M_A \\text{ and } M_B) = P(M_A) \\times P(M_B) $$\n$$ P(RM) = \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right)\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right)\\right) = \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2N_e}\\right)\\right)^2 $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $T = 4.0 \\times 10^5$ and $N_e = 1.0 \\times 10^5$. The time is measured in coalescent units, which is generations divided by $2N_e$.\n$$ \\frac{T}{2N_e} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^5}{2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^5)} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^5}{2.0 \\times 10^5} = 2 $$\nThe dimensionless time is $2$. We substitute this into our expression for the probability of reciprocal monophyly.\n$$ P(RM) = \\left(1 - \\exp(-2)\\right)^2 $$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\exp(-2) \\approx 0.13533528... $$\n$$ 1 - \\exp(-2) \\approx 1 - 0.13533528 = 0.86466471... $$\n$$ P(RM) \\approx (0.86466471...)^2 \\approx 0.747643... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final probability is $0.7476$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7476}$$", "id": "2611208"}, {"introduction": "Building on the theoretical probabilities of lineage sorting, this exercise turns to quantifying genealogical patterns from empirical data.

The focal candidate cluster, denoted $X$, consists of $n=5$ sampled individuals embedded in a broader sample of $N=20$ individuals on each rooted gene tree. The species tree is consistent across loci and has branch lengths in coalescent units: the stem branch subtending $X$ from its sister lineage $Y$ is $t_{XY}=1.1$, and the ancestral branch from the $X\\!+\\!Y$ ancestor to the next outgroup $Z$ is $t_{(XY)Z}=0.3$. These values are provided as biological context for incomplete lineage sorting expectations but are not to be directly substituted into any calculation.\n\nYou are to quantify the degree of genealogical exclusivity of $X$ on each rooted gene tree using the Genealogical Sorting Index (gsi). For a given gene tree, let $s$ denote the number of tips in the smallest clade that contains all $n$ members of $X$ (the minimum enclosing clade size). The gsi for $X$ must satisfy the following conceptual constraints derived from core definitions of monophyly and exclusivity:\n- If $X$ is strictly monophyletic on a gene tree, then $s=n$ and the index must attain its maximum value.\n- If $X$ is completely nonexclusive such that the entire tree is required to enclose all members, then $s=N$ and the index must attain its minimum value.\n- The index should vary linearly with exclusivity as $s$ ranges between $n$ and $N$ so that equal increments in loss of exclusivity produce equal decrements in the index.\n\nUsing only these constraints, first derive an explicit expression for the gsi as a function of $s$, $n$, and $N$.\n\nAcross $5$ independent gene trees (loci), the observed minimum enclosing clade sizes for $X$ are:\n- Locus $1$: $s_{1}=5$\n- Locus $2$: $s_{2}=6$\n- Locus $3$: $s_{3}=7$\n- Locus $4$: $s_{4}=20$\n- Locus $5$: $s_{5}=5$\n\nCompute the across-locus mean gsi for $X$ by averaging the per-locus gsi values you derive.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of phylogenetic and population genetic theory, specifically the Multi-Species Coalescent model and the Genealogical Sorting Index ($gsi$). The problem is well-posed, with sufficient constraints to derive the required function and complete data for the subsequent calculation. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the Genealogical Sorting Index, $gsi$, as a function of the minimum enclosing clade size $s$, the number of individuals in the focal group $n$, and the total number of individuals in the sample $N$. The problem specifies three constraints:\n1. The index must be at a maximum value when the focal group $X$ is strictly monophyletic, which corresponds to $s=n$.\n2. The index must be at a minimum value when the group is completely nonexclusive, meaning the smallest enclosing clade is the entire tree, corresponding to $s=N$.\n3. The index must vary linearly as $s$ ranges from $n$ to $N$.\n\nA linear relationship between $gsi$ and $s$ can be expressed as $gsi(s) = as + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. By convention, indices of this nature are normalized to the interval $[0, 1]$. We will set the maximum value for perfect exclusivity to $1$ and the minimum value for complete lack of exclusivity to $0$.\n\nThis establishes a system of two linear equations based on the boundary conditions:\n1. For $s=n$ (monophyly): $gsi(n) = an + b = 1$\n2. For $s=N$ (complete non-exclusivity): $gsi(N) = aN + b = 0$\n\nWe can solve this system for the constants $a$ and $b$. From the second equation, we find $b = -aN$. Substituting this expression for $b$ into the first equation yields:\n$an - aN = 1$\n$a(n - N) = 1$\n$a = \\frac{1}{n-N}$\n\nNow, we solve for $b$:\n$b = -aN = -N \\left( \\frac{1}{n-N} \\right) = \\frac{-N}{n-N} = \\frac{N}{N-n}$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $a$ and $b$ back into the linear function $gsi(s) = as + b$, we obtain the general formula for the index:\n$gsi(s) = \\left( \\frac{1}{n-N} \\right) s + \\frac{N}{N-n} = \\frac{s - N}{n-N}$\nThis is more conventionally written as:\n$$gsi(s, n, N) = \\frac{N-s}{N-n}$$\nThis derived expression correctly satisfies all three initial constraints.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to the provided data. The parameters are $n=5$ and $N=20$. The specific formula for this study is:\n$$gsi(s) = \\frac{20-s}{20-5} = \\frac{20-s}{15}$$\n\nWe now compute the $gsi$ value for each of the $5$ loci using their observed minimum enclosing clade sizes ($s_i$):\n- Locus $1$ ($s_1=5$): $gsi_1 = \\frac{20-5}{15} = \\frac{15}{15} = 1$\n- Locus $2$ ($s_2=6$): $gsi_2 = \\frac{20-6}{15} = \\frac{14}{15}$\n- Locus $3$ ($s_3=7$): $gsi_3 = \\frac{20-7}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}$\n- Locus $4$ ($s_4=20$): $gsi_4 = \\frac{20-20}{15} = \\frac{0}{15} = 0$\n- Locus $5$ ($s_5=5$): $gsi_5 = \\frac{20-5}{15} = \\frac{15}{15} = 1$\n\nThe across-locus mean $gsi$, denoted $\\overline{gsi}$, is the arithmetic average of these individual values:\n$$\\overline{gsi} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} gsi_i = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( 1 + \\frac{14}{15} + \\frac{13}{15} + 0 + 1 \\right)$$\nTo compute this, we convert all terms to a common denominator of $15$:\n$$\\overline{gsi} = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{15}{15} + \\frac{14}{15} + \\frac{13}{15} + \\frac{0}{15} + \\frac{15}{15} \\right) = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{15+14+13+0+15}{15} \\right)$$\n$$\\overline{gsi} = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{57}{15} \\right) = \\frac{57}{75}$$\nDividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, $3$, we simplify the fraction:\n$$\\overline{gsi} = \\frac{19}{25} = 0.76$$\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result. A mean $gsi$ of $0.76$ indicates a strong, but not absolute, signal of genealogical exclusivity for the candidate species $X$. The Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC) emphasizes diagnosable exclusivity. The observed pattern of two loci showing perfect monophyly ($gsi=1$), two showing near-monophyly, and one showing complete non-exclusivity ($gsi=0$) is informative.\nUnder the Multi-Species Coalescent (MSC) model, the probability of obtaining a monophyletic gene tree for a species is a function of the length of its stem branch in coalescent units. Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is expected to prevent monophyly on some proportion of gene trees, and this proportion decreases as the stem branch length increases. The probability for two lineages to fail to coalesce in a branch of length $t$ (in coalescent units) is $\\exp(-t)$. For the given stem branch length $t_{XY}=1.1$, the probability of ILS between groups $X$ and $Y$ is $\\exp(-1.1) \\approx 0.33$. This suggests that roughly one-third of gene trees are expected to show non-monophyly. Our empirical result of observing non-monophyly in $3$ out of $5$ loci (with varying degrees) is consistent with this theoretical expectation. The complete failure of sorting at Locus $4$ ($s=20$, $gsi=0$) indicates deep ILS, where lineages from $X$ fail to coalesce even on the ancestral branch of length $t_{(XY)Z}=0.3$. The probability of such deep coalescence is $\\exp(-(t_{XY}+t_{(XY)Z})) = \\exp(-1.4) \\approx 0.25$. Observing one such event in five trials is not improbable.\nIn summary, the high mean $gsi$ of $0.76$, along with the specific pattern of sorting across loci, is fully consistent with the predictions of the MSC for a recently diverged lineage with a stem branch length of $t_{XY}=1.1$. This provides strong quantitative support for recognizing $X$ as a distinct species under the PSC.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the across-locus mean $gsi$, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$\\overline{gsi} = 0.7600$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7600}$$", "id": "2611143"}, {"introduction": "While single-locus measures provide valuable insight, modern species delimitation often relies on synthesizing information across the entire genome to assess population-level differentiation.

To calculate the total gene diversity, $H_{T\\ell}$, we first compute the pooled allele frequency, $p_{T\\ell}$, across both populations:\n    $$ p_{T\\ell} = \\frac{A_{1\\ell} + A_{2\\ell}}{n_{1\\ell} + n_{2\\ell}} $$\n    The total gene diversity is then the expected heterozygosity in the pooled population:\n    $$ H_{T\\ell} = 2 p_{T\\ell} (1 - p_{T\\ell}) $$\n\nNext, we aggregate these statistics across all loci to obtain the genome-wide estimate $\\widehat{F}_{ST}$. The estimator is a ratio of sums, not a sum of ratios. We only consider informative loci, defined as those where $H_{T\\ell} > 0$. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of indices for these informative loci. The point estimate is:\n$$ \\widehat{F}_{ST} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\ell \\in \\mathcal{I}} (H_{T\\ell} - H_{S\\ell})}{\\sum_{\\ell \\in \\mathcal{I}} H_{T\\ell}} $$\nIf the denominator is zero (i.e., no loci are polymorphic in the pooled sample), $\\widehat{F}_{ST}$ is defined as $0$.\n\nTo assess the statistical uncertainty of $\\widehat{F}_{ST}$, we employ a non-parametric bootstrap procedure.\n1.  A pseudorandom number generator is seeded with $1729$ for reproducibility.\n2.  We perform $B = 5000$ bootstrap replicates. In each replicate, we create a new dataset of $L$ loci by sampling with replacement from the original set of $L$ loci.\n3.  For each bootstrap dataset, we recalculate the genome-wide $F_{ST}$ value using the pre-computed per-locus components $(H_{T\\ell} - H_{S\\ell})$ and $H_{T\\ell}$. If the denominator of the $F_{ST}$ calculation for a bootstrap replicate is zero, its value is set to $0$.\n4.  This process yields a distribution of $5000$ bootstrap estimates of $F_{ST}$.\n\nFrom this bootstrap distribution, we construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval using the percentile method. The lower bound, $\\text{CI\\_low}$, is the $2.5$-th percentile (the empirical quantile at $0.025$), and the upper bound, $\\text{CI\\_high}$, is the $97.5$-th percentile (the empirical quantile at $0.975$) of the sorted bootstrap values.\n\nFinally, a decision is made regarding whether the observed genetic differentiation supports recognizing the populations as distinct species. This decision is based on a pre-defined threshold, $\\tau = 0.25$.\n-   The decision is `True` if the lower bound of the confidence interval is strictly greater than the threshold: $\\text{CI\\_low} > \\tau$.\n-   Otherwise, the decision is `False`.\n\nThis procedure is applied independently to each of the four provided datasets. The final numerical results ($\\widehat{F}_{ST}$, $\\text{CI\\_low}$, $\\text{CI\\_high}$) are rounded to six decimal places for reporting.", "answer": "```\n[[0.260870,0.117284,0.407945,False],[0.569474,0.222222,0.857143,False],[0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,False],[0.741026,0.592593,0.875000,True]]\n```", "id": "2611128"}]}
