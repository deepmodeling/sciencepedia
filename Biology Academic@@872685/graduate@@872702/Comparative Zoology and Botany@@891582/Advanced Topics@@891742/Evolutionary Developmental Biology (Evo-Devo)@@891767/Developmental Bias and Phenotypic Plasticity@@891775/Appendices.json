Understanding which confounding variables each design controls is the first and most critical step toward generating meaningful data on how organisms respond to their environments.", "problem": "A comparative biologist aims to disentangle developmental bias and phenotypic plasticity across lineages of amphibians and annual grasses that inhabit paired cool-wet versus warm-dry valleys. The target phenotypes include larval limb length and leaf thickness. The investigator adopts the quantitative genetic decomposition in which the observed phenotype $P$ is represented as a function of genotype $G$, environment $E$, genotype-by-environment interaction (G×E), parental or maternal effects $M$, and residual error $\\epsilon$, so that $P = G + E + G \\times E + M + \\epsilon$. The overarching goal is to choose experimental designs that remove or explicitly estimate subsets of these components to isolate plasticity and assess developmental bias.\n\nSelect all options that correctly define each experimental design (common garden, reciprocal transplant, split-brood) and accurately state which confounders each design controls in the context of plasticity studies.\n\nA. Common garden: collect multiple genotypes from different source populations and rear them through early development in the same standardized environment. This design controls environmental heterogeneity at the time of measurement (standardizing $E$ and site-of-test effects) and allows differences in $P$ to be attributed to $G$ and any persistent $M$. By itself, it does not eliminate $M$ carried from the field in the founding generation and cannot estimate $G \\times E$ unless replicated across distinct environments.\n\nB. Reciprocal transplant: at the same life stage and time, move individuals or families from each population into both their home habitat and the alternate habitat, measuring performance and form in each site. This design controls confounding between genotype-of-origin and site-of-test by symmetrical placement across environments, enables estimation of plasticity and local adaptation via reaction norms across native environments (i.e., it can estimate $G \\times E$), but does not, on its own, remove parental $M$ or handling-induced transplant shock unless additional controls are implemented.\n\nC. Split-brood: partition full-sibling or clonal offspring from the same parents across contrasting environments, randomizing siblings among treatments and rearing them in parallel. This design controls among-family genetic and maternal provisioning confounders by using within-family contrasts, directly estimates environmental effects on $P$ (plasticity), and can test for $G \\times E$ at the family or genotype level; it does not remove shared pre-split rearing influences if the split occurs after early development.\n\nD. Common garden: because the maternal environment no longer differs at the time of measurement, this design eliminates $M$ even when field-collected embryos or seeds are used and reared briefly before measurement; any remaining variation must therefore be $G$.\n\nE. Reciprocal transplant: because transplants are performed in both directions, handling effects and transplant shock automatically cancel, so this design controls both $E$ and $M$ without additional procedures, leaving only $G$ and $G \\times E$ to be estimated.\n\nF. Split-brood: by distributing siblings across environments, this design eliminates genetic variance, so any observed differences in $P$ must be purely environmental and plastic; it therefore cannot be used to estimate $G \\times E$.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Research Topic**: Disentangling developmental bias and phenotypic plasticity.\n- **Study Organisms**: Lineages of amphibians and annual grasses.\n- **Environments**: Paired cool-wet versus warm-dry valleys.\n- **Phenotypes of Interest**: Larval limb length and leaf thickness.\n- **Quantitative Genetic Model**: The phenotype $P$ is a sum of effects: $P = G + E + G \\times E + M + \\epsilon$.\n    - $P$: Observed phenotype.\n    - $G$: Genotypic effect.\n    - $E$: Environmental effect.\n    - $G \\times E$: Genotype-by-environment interaction.\n    - $M$: Parental or maternal effects.\n    - $\\epsilon$: Residual error.\n- **Objective**: To select correct descriptions of experimental designs (common garden, reciprocal transplant, split-brood) and their capacity to control for confounding variables in studies of plasticity.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is grounded in the foundational principles of quantitative genetics and experimental design in evolutionary ecology. The model $P = G + E + G \\times E + M + \\epsilon$ is a standard linear model used to partition phenotypic variance. The experimental designs listed are canonical methods in the field. The biological context is realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for an evaluation of several statements against established scientific definitions and principles. A definite set of correct and incorrect statements exists based on the theory of experimental design.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard terminology from the field of evolutionary biology. There is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question on the topic of experimental design in quantitative genetics. I will proceed with the analysis of each option.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\nThe fundamental goal is to partition the phenotypic variance, $\\text{Var}(P)$, into its causal components: $\\text{Var}(G)$, $\\text{Var}(E)$, $\\text{Var}(G \\times E)$, $\\text{Var}(M)$, and $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)$, along with covariance terms. An experimental design is a specific way to structure an experiment to make certain components zero or to allow for their estimation. Phenotypic plasticity is the phenomenon where a genotype ($G$) produces different phenotypes ($P$) in different environments ($E$). This is captured by the $E$ term (for the average plastic response) and the $G \\times E$ term (for variation in plasticity among genotypes).\n\n**Option A: Common garden**\nThe statement defines a common garden experiment as rearing multiple genotypes from different origins in a single, standardized environment. This is a correct definition. By design, the environment ($E$) is held constant for all individuals in the experiment. Therefore, any observed variation in the phenotype ($P$) cannot be due to variation in the current environment. The variation must arise from factors that differ among the individuals, which are their genotype ($G$) and any parental or maternal effects ($M$) they carry from their source environment or parents. The statement correctly identifies that this design, on its own, does not eliminate these carried-over maternal effects ($M$). Furthermore, because all individuals are in a single environment, it is impossible to measure how genotypes would respond to *different* environments, so the genotype-by-environment interaction ($G \\times E$) cannot be estimated. This requires replication of the genotypes across at least two distinct environments. The statement is entirely accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: Reciprocal transplant**\nThis design involves moving organisms from each source population into all other source populations' habitats, creating a fully crossed design of genotype source and destination environment. This accurately describes a reciprocal transplant. Such a design does not hold $E$ constant but rather manipulates it factorially along with $G$. This allows for the separate estimation of the main effect of genotype ($G$), the main effect of environment ($E$), and their interaction ($G \\times E$). The $G \\times E$ term is the statistical signature of local adaptation if the \"home\" genotypes outperform \"away\" genotypes. The statement correctly notes that this design does not, by itself, remove parental effects ($M$) or the physiological shock of being transplanted. These are well-known confounders that require additional controls, such as transplanting organisms within their home site to estimate handling effects. The statement is accurate in its description and its assessment of limitations.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option C: Split-brood**\nThis design involves taking offspring from a single set of parents (a family or brood, which can be full-siblings or clones) and distributing them across different experimental environments. This is a correct definition. The key feature is that, within a family, comparisons are made between genetically related individuals (identical in the case of clones, or with an average relatedness of $0.5$ for full-sibs). This controls for genetic differences that exist *between* families and also for maternal effects ($M$) that are common to all offspring from the same mother (e.g., yolk provisioning). The difference in phenotype between siblings in different environments is a direct estimate of plasticity for that specific family (genotype). By replicating this for multiple families, one can compare the plastic responses among families. If the response differs, this is evidence for a $G \\times E$ interaction at the family level. The caveat that shared environmental effects prior to the split are not controlled is also an important and correct point. The statement is accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option D: Common garden**\nThis statement claims that a common garden design eliminates maternal effects ($M$) because the maternal environment is no longer different at the time of measurement. This is a fundamental misunderstanding. Maternal effects are, by definition, effects of the parent's phenotype or environment on the offspring's phenotype. These effects are established *before* the experiment begins (e.g., seed provisioning, egg quality, maternal hormones). Rearing offspring in a common environment does not erase these pre-existing differences. Consequently, the assertion that any remaining variation must be purely genetic ($G$) is also false; it is a combination of $G$ and $M$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: Reciprocal transplant**\nThis statement claims that transplant shock effects \"automatically cancel\" because transplants are bidirectional. There is no physical or biological principle that guarantees this. The stress of moving from a cold to a warm environment may be physiologically very different from the stress of moving from warm to cold. The effects are not necessarily symmetric and will not cancel. The statement further claims the design controls for $E$ and $M$. It does not control for $E$; it purposefully varies $E$. As established, it also does not control for $M$. The conclusion that only $G$ and $G \\times E$ remain to be estimated is therefore incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option F: Split-brood**\nThis statement claims that a split-brood design \"eliminates genetic variance\". This is imprecise and leads to a false conclusion. The design works by controlling for genetic variance *between families* when making *within-family* comparisons. Genetic variance absolutely still exists in the total experimental population (across all families) and is, in fact, necessary to estimate $G \\times E$. The claim that the design *cannot* be used to estimate $G \\times E$ is the direct opposite of the truth. Comparing the plastic responses of different families (i.e., different genotypes) is precisely how $G \\times E$ is detected with this design.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, options A, B, and C provide correct definitions and interpretations of the experimental designs, while options D, E, and F contain significant conceptual errors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2565334"}, {"introduction": "Once an experiment is complete, the challenge shifts to interpretation: what do the data tell us about the interplay of genes and environment? This problem [@problem_id:2565345] provides a realistic dataset and statistical output from a common garden experiment, asking you to translate these quantitative results into a biological narrative. By analyzing the reaction norms for stomatal density, you will practice identifying phenotypic plasticity, genetic differentiation, and the subtle but important signature of a potential developmental bias.", "problem": "A plant ecologist compares stomatal density across an elevation gradient to disentangle phenotypic plasticity from genetic differentiation. Seeds were collected from two populations of the same species: a low-elevation origin ($L$) and a high-elevation origin ($H$). From each origin, $n = 10$ maternal families were sampled and grown in a split-brood design in two controlled common-garden environments that simulate low elevation ($E_L$: higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide, warmer, higher vapor pressure deficit) and high elevation ($E_H$: lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide, cooler, lower vapor pressure deficit). Each family contributed $2$ clonally propagated individuals per environment. Stomatal density (stomata per $\\mathrm{mm}^2$) was measured on fully expanded leaves after maturity.\n\nAs a foundational base, recall the following core definitions. A reaction norm is a mapping from environment to phenotype for a given genotype. Phenotypic plasticity is the change in phenotype of a genotype across environments, typically reflected by the slope of its reaction norm. Genetic differentiation among populations is present when genotypes from different origins differ in phenotype when measured in a common environment. A genotype-by-environment interaction is present when the effect of the environment on phenotype differs among genotypes or origins, typically reflected by non-parallel reaction norms. Developmental bias refers to the tendency of developmental processes to preferentially produce certain phenotypic changes over others across genotypes and environments, predicting aligned or constrained reaction norm directions when bias is shared.\n\nThe study reports the following grand means (mean across families; mean $\\pm$ standard error) for stomatal density:\n- Origin $L$: in $E_L$, $155 \\pm 5$; in $E_H$, $222 \\pm 6$.\n- Origin $H$: in $E_L$, $165 \\pm 5$; in $E_H$, $232 \\pm 6$.\n\nA linear mixed model with fixed effects of environment ($E$), origin ($O$), and their interaction ($E \\times O$), and random family nested within origin, yields:\n- Environment main effect: $F_{1,36} = 128.4$, $p < 0.0001$.\n- Origin main effect: $F_{1,18} = 5.6$, $p = 0.028$.\n- Interaction $E \\times O$: $F_{1,36} = 0.31$, $p = 0.58$.\n\nBased on these results and the foundational definitions above, which interpretation is most strongly supported?\n\nA. The pattern is explained by phenotypic plasticity alone; there is no evidence of genetic differentiation or of a shared developmental bias aligning response directions.\n\nB. The pattern is explained by genetic differentiation alone; there is no evidence of phenotypic plasticity across environments.\n\nC. Both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation are present; reaction norms are effectively parallel across origins (no genotype-by-environment interaction), consistent with a shared developmental bias that channels the response toward higher stomatal density in high-elevation conditions.\n\nD.

The concepts of phenotypic plasticity, genetic differentiation, genotype-by-environment interaction, and developmental bias are central tenets of this field. The use of a linear mixed model is appropriate for the hierarchical data structure (clones within families within origins). The observed trend—higher stomatal density in high-elevation conditions (lower $pCO_2$)—is consistent with established plant ecophysiology.\n*   **Well-Posed and Objective:** The problem provides clear definitions, quantitative data, and formal statistical results, asking for the most supported interpretation. The question is objective and has a unique, derivable answer based on the provided information.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The provided statistical results are consistent with the mean values and the experimental design. The degrees of freedom for the $F$-tests are plausible for such a model. No contradictions or missing critical information are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution can be formulated.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to interpret the provided statistical results and mean values in the context of the given definitions.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Phenotypic Plasticity:** Phenotypic plasticity is the change in phenotype across environments. Evidence for this is provided by the main effect of Environment ($E$). The statistical result is $F_{1,36} = 128.4$ with $p < 0.0001$. This highly significant result indicates that, on average, stomatal density differs between the two environments, $E_L$ and $E_H$. For both origins, moving from $E_L$ to $E_H$ causes a substantial increase in stomatal density ($155 \\to 222$ for origin $L$; $165 \\to 232$ for origin $H$). Therefore, there is strong evidence for phenotypic plasticity.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Genetic Differentiation:** Genetic differentiation is present if genotypes from different origins differ in phenotype within a common environment. Evidence for this is provided by the main effect of Origin ($O$). The statistical result is $F_{1,18} = 5.6$ with $p = 0.028$. This significant result indicates that, averaging across environments, plants from origin $L$ and origin $H$ have different mean stomatal densities. Examining the means within each environment confirms this: in $E_L$, the mean density is $155$ for origin $L$ and $165$ for origin $H$; in $E_H$, the mean density is $222$ for origin $L$ and $232$ for origin $H$. In both cases, the high-elevation origin ($H$) has a higher stomatal density than the low-elevation origin ($L$). This demonstrates genetic differentiation for the trait.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Genotype-by-Environment Interaction ($G \\times E$):** A $G \\times E$ interaction occurs when the reaction norms of different genotypes are not parallel. This is tested by the interaction term $E \\times O$. The statistical result is $F_{1,36} = 0.31$ with $p = 0.58$. This high $p$-value indicates a lack of statistical evidence for an interaction. The reaction norms are, therefore, considered parallel. We can verify this by calculating the slope of the reaction norms from the mean values.\n    *   Slope for origin $L$: $\\Delta(\\text{density})_L = 222 - 155 = 67$.\n    *   Slope for origin $H$: $\\Delta(\\text{density})_H = 232 - 165 = 67$.\n    The slopes are identical, perfectly matching the non-significant interaction term. This means the magnitude of the plastic response to the environment is the same for both origins.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Developmental Bias:** Developmental bias is defined as a tendency for developmental processes to produce certain phenotypic outcomes preferentially. The observation that reaction norms for both origins are not only aligned (both have positive slopes) but are also parallel is strong evidence consistent with a shared developmental bias. It implies that the developmental system of this species is constrained or \"channeled\" to respond to the environmental shift from $E_L$ to $E_H$ in a highly specific and consistent manner, irrespective of genetic origin.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. The pattern is explained by phenotypic plasticity alone; there is no evidence of genetic differentiation or of a shared developmental bias aligning response directions.**\n    This statement is **Incorrect**. There is significant evidence for genetic differentiation (main effect of Origin, $p = 0.028$). The parallel reaction norms are, in fact, consistent with a shared developmental bias, not a lack of it.\n\n*   **B. The pattern is explained by genetic differentiation alone; there is no evidence of phenotypic plasticity across environments.**\n    This statement is **Incorrect**. There is extremely strong evidence for phenotypic plasticity (main effect of Environment, $p < 0.0001$).\n\n*   **C. Both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation are present; reaction norms are effectively parallel across origins (no genotype-by-environment interaction), consistent with a shared developmental bias that channels the response toward higher stomatal density in high-elevation conditions.**\n    This statement is **Correct**. It accurately synthesizes all pieces of evidence:\n    1.  Both plasticity (significant $E$ effect) and genetic differentiation (significant $O$ effect) are present.\n    2.  The reaction norms are parallel (non-significant $E \\times O$ interaction).\n    3.  This pattern of parallel reaction norms is a textbook example of a phenomenon that is consistent with the operation of a shared developmental bias.\n\n*   **D. There is strong genotype-by-environment interaction with crossing reaction norms; plasticity varies markedly among origins, contradicting the idea of a shared developmental bias.**\n    This statement is **Incorrect**. The statistical test shows no genotype-by-environment interaction ($p = 0.58$), not a strong one. The reaction norms are parallel, not crossing (origin $H$ always has a higher density than origin $L$). Plasticity does not vary among origins; the change in phenotype is identical ($67$ units).

The external perturbation $u(t)$ must be correctly evaluated within this function based on the value of $t$ relative to $t_0$ and $t_1$.\n\nThe overall procedure is as follows:\n1.  Define the RHS function, which takes as arguments time $t$, state vector $\\vec{z}=[x, y]$, and all model parameters ($s_1, s_2, d_1, d_2, K_1, K_2, n, A, t_0, t_1$).\n2.  Iterate through the four specified test cases.\n3.  For each case, establish the initial state vector $\\vec{z_0} = [x_0, y_0]$ and the time interval for integration, $[0, T]$.\n4.  Invoke the numerical ODE solver (`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`) with the RHS function, time interval, initial state, and the set of parameters for the current case. The solver computes the trajectory $\\vec{z}(t)$ over the interval.\n5.  Extract the final state of the system, $\\vec{z}(T) = [x(T), y(T)]$, from the solver's output.\n6.  Apply the phenotype classifier $\\phi$ by computing the difference $x(T) - y(T)$ and comparing it against the tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-3}$. The result is an integer: $+1$ ($x$-dominant), $-1$ ($y$-dominant), or $0$ (symmetric).\n7.  Collect the classification results for all four cases and format them as a single comma-separated list enclosed in brackets.\n\nThe four test cases are designed to probe distinct behaviors of the toggle switch:\n- Case $1$: The system parameters ($s_1, s_2, d_1, d_2, K_1, K_2$) are perfectly symmetric, and the Hill coefficient $n=2.0$ ensures bistability. The initial state has a minute bias toward $y$ ($y_0 = x_0 + 10^{-4}$). In a symmetric bistable system, a small initial asymmetry is typically amplified, driving the system to the corresponding stable state. Thus, a $y$-dominant outcome ($\\phi = -1$) is expected.\n- Case $2$: An asymmetry is introduced in the synthesis rates, with $s_1 = 8.0$ and $s_2 = 6.0$, creating an intrinsic bias toward the $x$-dominant state. This bias competes with the initial condition, which still slightly favors $y$. The question is whether the stronger synthesis of $x$ can overcome the initial advantage of $y$. A substantial difference in synthesis rates should be sufficient to force the system into the $x$-dominant state ($\\phi = +1$). This illustrates how genetic parameters can create a developmental bias.\n- Case $3$: Asymmetry is introduced in the decay rates, with $d_1 = 2.0$ and $d_2 = 1.0$. A higher decay rate for $x$ penalizes its accumulation, creating an intrinsic bias toward the $y$-dominant state. This competes with an initial condition that now favors $x$. The two-fold higher decay rate is a strong disadvantage, and the system is expected to resolve to the $y$-dominant state ($\\phi = -1$).\n- Case $4$: The Hill coefficient is reduced to $n=1.0$. For a mutual repression toggle switch, bistability is lost for low cooperativity ($n \\le 1.5 - 2$, depending on other parameters). With $n=1.0$, the system possesses a single, globally stable steady state. Given the symmetric parameters and perfectly symmetric initial conditions ($x_0 = y_0$), the trajectory must remain on the line $x(t) = y(t)$ for all time $t \\ge 0$. The final state will be $x(T) = y(T)$, leading to a symmetric classification ($\\phi = 0$).", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the gene toggle switch ODE model for four test cases and\n    classifies the phenotypic outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: symmetric toggle, slight initial bias toward y\n        {'s1': 6.0, 's2': 6.0, 'd1': 1.0, 'd2': 1.0, 'K1': 1.0, 'K2': 1.0, 'n': 2.0,\n         'x0': 0.2, 'y0': 0.2001, 'A': 0.5, 't0': 5.0, 't1': 10.0, 'T': 50.0, 'tau': 1e-3},\n        # Case 2: asymmetric synthesis favoring x, same initial bias toward y\n        {'s1': 8.0, 's2': 6.0, 'd1': 1.0, 'd2': 1.0, 'K1': 1.0, 'K2': 1.0, 'n': 2.0,\n         'x0': 0.2, 'y0': 0.2001, 'A': 0.5, 't0': 5.0, 't1': 10.0, 'T': 50.0, 'tau': 1e-3},\n        # Case 3: asymmetric decay penalizing x, initial bias toward x\n        {'s1': 6.0, 's2': 6.0, 'd1': 2.0, 'd2': 1.0, 'K1': 1.0, 'K2': 1.0, 'n': 2.0,\n         'x0': 0.2001, 'y0': 0.2, 'A': 0.5, 't0': 5.0, 't1': 10.0, 'T': 50.0, 'tau': 1e-3},\n        # Case 4: low cooperativity, symmetric, identical initial condition\n        {'s1': 6.0, 's2': 6.0, 'd1': 1.0, 'd2': 1.0, 'K1': 1.0, 'K2': 1.0, 'n': 1.0,\n         'x0': 0.2, 'y0': 0.2, 'A': 0.5, 't0': 5.0, 't1': 10.0, 'T': 50.0, 'tau': 1e-3},\n    ]\n\n    def toggle_switch_rhs(t, z, s1, s2, d1, d2, K1, K2, n, A, t0, t1):\n        \"\"\"\n        Right-hand side of the ODE system for the toggle switch.\n        \n        Args:\n            t (float): Current time.\n            z (list or np.ndarray): State vector [x, y].\n            All other args are model parameters.\n        \n        Returns:\n            list: The derivatives [dx/dt, dy/dt].\n        \"\"\"\n        x, y = z\n        \n        # Environmental input u(t)\n        u_t = A if t0 <= t <= t1 else 0.0\n        \n        # Hill repression terms\n        repression_of_x = 1.0 + (y / K1)**n\n        repression_of_y = 1.0 + (x / K2)**n\n        \n        # ODEs\n        dxdt = (s1 / repression_of_x) - d1 * x + u_t\n        dydt = (s2 / repression_of_y) - d2 * y + u_t\n        \n        return [dxdt, dydt]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Initial conditions\n        z0 = [case['x0'], case['y0']]\n        \n        # Time span for integration\n        t_span = (0, case['T'])\n        \n        # Pack parameters for the solver\n        params = (case['s1'], case['s2'], case['d1'], case['d2'], \n                  case['K1'], case['K2'], case['n'], \n                  case['A'], case['t0'], case['t1'])\n        \n        # Solve the ODE\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=toggle_switch_rhs,\n            t_span=t_span,\n            y0=z0,\n            method='LSODA',  # Robust for stiff and non-stiff problems\n            args=params,\n            dense_output=False,\n            vectorized=False\n        )\n        \n        # Get final state\n        x_T, y_T = sol.y[:, -1]\n        \n        # Phenotype classification\n        diff = x_T - y_T\n        tau = case['tau']\n        \n        if diff > tau:\n            phi = 1\n        elif diff < -tau:\n            phi = -1\n        else:\n            phi = 0\n            \n        results.append(phi)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "2565363"}]}
