For a balanced design, the observed mean squares are estimators of linear combinations of the underlying variance components. The model for a phenotypic measurement $y_{ij}$ on the $j$-th offspring in the $i$-th family is $y_{ij} = \\mu + f_i + e_{ij}$, where $\\mu$ is the population mean, $f_i$ is the random effect of the $i$-th family, and $e_{ij}$ is the within-family residual error.

You will design a decisive experiment to untangle the causal relationship between auxin signaling and vascular patterning, two key processes in leaf morphogenesis. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2569355] hones the critical skill of formulating testable hypotheses and choosing the right molecular and imaging tools to probe cause and effect in developmental systems.", "problem": "You are investigating whether hydathode-associated veins in a developing dicot leaf are a cause or a consequence of local auxin maxima at the leaf margin. Hydathodes are specialized structures at serration tips or margins that exude xylem sap and are consistently contiguous with a major vein. You have access to standard auxin reporters and vascular identity markers, as well as chemical and genetic tools to perturb auxin transport and procambial differentiation. Assume the following well-tested facts as a base: auxin response reporters such as DR5 (a synthetic promoter driving a fluorescent protein) increase fluorescence with increased nuclear auxin signaling; the DII-VENUS sensor (an Aux/IAA domain II fused to the VENUS fluorophore) is degraded more rapidly at higher auxin, so its fluorescence is inversely related to auxin; polar auxin transport depends on PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) polarity; the early procambial identity marker ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX8 (ATHB8) labels pre-vascular strands; and the polar auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) reduces canalization of auxin flow. Causality in development can be probed by temporal precedence (a cause must precede an effect) and tests of necessity and sufficiency using targeted perturbations.\n\nWhich experimental design (including time-resolved imaging and targeted perturbations) would most cleanly distinguish whether hydathode-associated veins are a cause or a consequence of local auxin maxima, and also specifies interpretable outcomes that decide between the two hypotheses?\n\nA. Use a dual-reporter Arabidopsis line expressing DR5rev::nuclear VENUS for auxin response and ATHB8::GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) for procambial identity. Perform laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) time-lapse imaging of early leaf primordia encompassing the hydathode region at the margin, acquiring images every $10$ minutes over $6$ hours to extract the onset times $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ of DR5 and ATHB8 signals, respectively. Execute two perturbations with proper controls: (i) a micro-applied lanolin bead containing indole-3-acetic acid at the hydathode tip to test sufficiency, and (ii) a narrow NPA-containing agarose strip crossing the margin proximal to the hydathode to transiently block polar auxin transport and a procambial-specific, inducible stabilization of the auxin response inhibitor BODENLOS (BDL; stabilized IAA12) using an ATHB8-driver activated just before $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ to test necessity. Interpretations: if veins cause auxin maxima, then $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$, ATHB8 induction is necessary for the DR5 maximum (inducible BDL prevents the DR5 increase), and local auxin addition does not create ATHB8 strands without pre-existing vein cues. If auxin maxima cause veins, then $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$, inducible BDL blocks ATHB8 but leaves the early DR5 maximum intact, the NPA strip prevents ATHB8 canalization but not the initial DR5 increase at the hydathode, and the auxin bead is sufficient to induce an ectopic ATHB8 strand oriented toward the bead.\n\nB. Image a PIN1::GFP line by LSCM at a single late time point when hydathodes are morphologically visible, after a whole-seedling NPA treatment, to assess whether PIN1 polarity aligns with hydathode-associated veins. If PIN1 polarity is altered by NPA, infer that auxin maxima are a consequence of veins.\n\nC. Perform laser ablation of hydathode epithem cells and then collect whole-leaf tissue for bulk liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry quantification of free indole-3-acetic acid at $2$ and $24$ hours post-ablation. If auxin levels decrease after ablation, infer that veins cause auxin maxima; if they do not, infer the opposite.\n\nD. Use the DII-VENUS auxin sensor for time-lapse imaging at $30$-minute intervals over $12$ hours, but impose a global exogenous auxin spray just after ATHB8 becomes detectable in unperturbed controls. If the DII-VENUS signal decreases everywhere and ATHB8 expands, infer that auxin maxima are sufficient and therefore primary causes of vein formation.\n\nE. Profile single-nucleus transcriptomes of hydathode-adjacent cells and interior mesophyll at a single developmental stage to reconstruct pseudotime trajectories of procambial differentiation. If auxin-responsive genes are enriched before vascular genes along pseudotime, infer that auxin maxima cause hydathode-associated vein formation.\n\nSelect the option that provides a decisive, causally interpretable design with appropriate temporal resolution and perturbations, and that states clear outcome criteria discriminating between the two hypotheses.", "solution": "The goal is to determine whether hydathode-associated veins are a cause or a consequence of local auxin maxima at the leaf margin. From first principles about causality in developmental systems, three criteria are central: temporal precedence (the cause must occur before the effect), necessity (blocking the putative cause eliminates the effect), and sufficiency (artificially imposing the putative cause generates the effect). From well-tested auxin canalization theory, local auxin maxima at the margin drive PIN1 polarity and preprocambial strand formation; conversely, established veins could conceivably influence auxin accumulation via transport sinks. The experimental design must therefore jointly (i) measure the onset times $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ in the same tissue with sufficient temporal resolution, and (ii) implement spatially and temporally precise perturbations that test necessity and sufficiency without confounding global effects.\n\nOption A proposes a dual-reporter line combining DR5rev::nuclear VENUS and ATHB8::GFP, enabling simultaneous readout of auxin response and procambial identity. Time-lapse imaging every $10$ minutes over $6$ hours ensures that the temporal ordering of reporter onsets can be resolved, allowing a direct comparison of $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ in the hydathode region. The two perturbations are appropriately targeted: a local auxin source (lanolin bead with indole-3-acetic acid) tests sufficiency by assessing whether an imposed auxin maximum can induce an ectopic ATHB8-positive preprocambial strand oriented toward the source, consistent with canalization; the narrow NPA strip interrupts polar transport locally, which should disrupt canalization and prevent reinforcement of strands without necessarily eliminating an initial auxin maximum at the hydathode, and the procambial-specific, inducible expression of stabilized BODENLOS (IAA12) tests necessity of auxin response in procambial cells. Critically, the design specifies interpretable outcomes in terms of inequalities between onset times and the presence or absence of DR5 or ATHB8 signals under perturbations. If veins cause auxin maxima, one would expect $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and that blocking procambial differentiation (via inducible BDL in the ATHB8 domain) would prevent the DR5 maximum, demonstrating necessity of veins for the auxin maximum; conversely, if auxin maxima cause veins, one expects $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$, no effect of procambial inhibition on the early DR5 maximum (necessity of auxin response for vein formation but not for the auxin maximum itself), and sufficiency of local auxin to induce ectopic ATHB8 strands. This option thus meets the temporal, necessity, and sufficiency criteria with localized and time-controlled manipulations and specifies clear decision rules.\n\nOption B uses only a static, late time point of PIN1::GFP after a global NPA treatment. This lacks temporal precedence information between auxin maxima and vein identity because no auxin reporter is included and imaging is not time-resolved. Global NPA further introduces systemic alterations that confound local interpretations at hydathodes. Inferring causality from altered PIN1 polarity at a late stage is insufficient; it tests neither necessity nor sufficiency and cannot establish $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ versus $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$. Therefore, it is inadequate. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C employs laser ablation of hydathode epithem followed by bulk auxin quantification at $2$ and $24$ hours. While ablation is a perturbation, bulk liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry lacks spatial resolution and cannot distinguish auxin changes at the hydathode margin versus the rest of the leaf. Moreover, two coarse time points cannot resolve onset ordering, and ablation damages tissue, introducing wound responses that alter auxin levels independently. This design does not implement reporter-based time-resolved readouts nor controlled tests of necessity or sufficiency in procambial cells. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D uses DII-VENUS time-lapse but imposes a global auxin spray after ATHB8 becomes detectable in controls. The temporal manipulation is misplaced: altering auxin after $t_{\\mathrmvein}$ eliminates the ability to test temporal precedence. A global auxin increase confounds local causality and saturates the system, precluding interpretation of necessity or sufficiency at hydathodes. Additionally, global elevation of auxin cannot distinguish whether hydathode-associated veins arose due to an antecedent local maximum. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption E suggests single-nucleus transcriptomics at a single stage with computational pseudotime. Although pseudotime can order cell states, it is inferred and not a direct measurement of real time, and a single-stage snapshot cannot establish actual onset times $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ in vivo. Furthermore, it lacks targeted perturbations testing necessity and sufficiency. While enrichment of auxin-responsive genes before vascular genes along pseudotime might correlate with a model, it does not provide direct causal discrimination at the hydathode margin. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A integrates simultaneous, high-temporal-resolution imaging of auxin response and procambial identity with spatially and temporally precise perturbations that test both necessity and sufficiency, and it articulates clear, falsifiable outcome criteria distinguishing whether hydathode-associated veins are a cause or a consequence of local auxin maxima.
