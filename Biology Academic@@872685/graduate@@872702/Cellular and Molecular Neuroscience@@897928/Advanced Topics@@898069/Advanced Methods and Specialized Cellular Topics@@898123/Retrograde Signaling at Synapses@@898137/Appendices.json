I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is a kinetic competition. For DSI/DSE to occur, a $Ca^{2+}$ ion entering through a VGCC must diffuse to and activate DAGL before it is captured by the exogenous buffer (BAPTA or EGTA). We must, therefore, compare the characteristic time for diffusion, $t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, to the characteristic time for binding by each buffer, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time required for a $Ca^{2+}$ ion to diffuse the distance $x = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ from the VGCC pore to the DAGL catalytic site. We must work in consistent SI units.\nThe distance is $x = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe diffusion constant is $D \\approx 220\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 220 \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nUsing the provided formula for diffusion time:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\sim \\frac{x^2}{2D} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times (2.2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2}{4.4 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 5.68 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 5.68\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\nThis is the timescale on which the $Ca^{2+}$ signal must act.\n\nNext, we calculate the pseudo–first-order binding time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, for each buffer at the given concentration $[B] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFor BAPTA:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 4\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}}[B]} = \\frac{1}{(4\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{1}{4 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nFor EGTA:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 1.5\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}}[B]} = \\frac{1}{(1.5\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{1}{1.5 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 6.67 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 66.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNow we compare the timescales for each buffer:\n-   **BAPTA**: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 0.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx 5.68\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. Here, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\ll t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$. The time to capture a $Ca^{2+}$ ion is much shorter than the time required for it to diffuse to its target. BAPTA will intercept the vast majority of $Ca^{2+}$ ions before they can reach DAGL. Consequently, loading the cell with $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA should strongly suppress or abolish DSI/DSE.\n\n-   **EGTA**: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 66.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx 5.68\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. Here, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\gg t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$. The time required for EGTA to capture a $Ca^{2+}$ ion is much longer than the diffusion time to the target. A significant fraction of $Ca^{2+}$ ions will therefore reach and activate DAGL before being chelated by EGTA. Loading the cell with $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA should have a much weaker effect on DSI/DSE, likely sparing it.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that the critical parameter governing the efficacy of a buffer in a signaling nanodomain is its association rate constant ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$), not its equilibrium affinity ($K_d$). BAPTA is a \"fast\" buffer, while EGTA is a \"slow\" buffer.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A. DSI/DSE are abolished by $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA but spared by $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA, because BAPTA’s fast $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ intercepts $Ca^{2+}$ within nanodomains ($\\sim 10$–$100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) before diffusion to DAGL, whereas EGTA’s slower $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ cannot compete on this timescale.**\nThis option correctly predicts that BAPTA will abolish the effect while EGTA will spare it. The reasoning is based on the difference in their association rate constants ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) and how this kinetic property relates to the rapid spatiotemporal dynamics within the $Ca^{2+}$ nanodomain (a relevant distance scale of $50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is given). This aligns perfectly with our calculations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. DSI/DSE are equally abolished by $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA and $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA, because both buffers have similar equilibrium affinity ($K_{d}$), so both equally reduce peak local $[Ca^{2+}]$ in nanodomains.**\nThe prediction that the effects are equal is incorrect, as demonstrated by our kinetic analysis. The reasoning is also fundamentally flawed. For rapid, localized signaling events within nanodomains, the binding kinetics ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) are the dominant factor, not the equilibrium affinity ($K_d$). The statement that both buffers equally reduce peak local $[Ca^{2+}]$ is false on the microsecond timescale relevant here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. DSI/DSE are more strongly reduced by $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA than by $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA, because EGTA has higher selectivity for $Ca^{2+}$ over magnesium ion ($Mg^{2+}$), making it the more effective chelator in nanodomains.**\nThe prediction that EGTA is more effective is the opposite of our conclusion. The reasoning is a distraction. While the selectivity of EGTA for $Ca^{2+}$ over $Mg^{2+}$ is a known property, it is not the relevant parameter for this problem, which is designed to test the understanding of reaction-diffusion kinetics. The binding speed ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) is the critical determinant of effectiveness in buffering rapid, local signals.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Neither $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA nor $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA affects DSI/DSE, because endocannabinoid production during DSI/DSE is driven by membrane depolarization per se rather than by $Ca^{2+}$ signals.**\nThis option contradicts a premise given directly in the problem statement: \"the prevailing model is that $2$-AG production during DSI/DSE is initiated by a local rise in postsynaptic calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) concentration\". Within the logical framework of the problem, this statement must be accepted as true. Therefore, this option is invalid as it denies the very mechanism we are asked to analyze.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2747106"}, {"introduction": "Once a retrograde messenger like an endocannabinoid reaches the presynaptic terminal, it modulates neurotransmitter release, often by reducing calcium influx.

The $25\\%$ increase in EPSC amplitude with AM251, the decrease in PPR from $1.9$ to $1.5$, the unchanged mEPSC amplitude, and increased mEPSC frequency together indicate an increase in presynaptic release probability $p$ (consistent with blockade of presynaptic CB$_1$ receptors), while constant $R_s$ and $R_{in}$ argue against artifactual changes in driving force or space clamp; thus postsynaptic receptor efficacy $q$ is unlikely to be the primary locus.\n\nB. The $25\\%$ increase in EPSC amplitude with AM251 is best explained by postsynaptic potentiation of $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, because an increase in $q$ would reduce PPR from $1.9$ to $1.5$ and increase mEPSC frequency without affecting $p$, which aligns with the observations.\n\nC.

It is a valid problem that can be solved using the principles of synaptic physiology. I will proceed with the analysis.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe goal is to determine if the observed effects of the CB$_1$ antagonist AM251 are primarily presynaptic or postsynaptic. We use the quantal model of synaptic transmission, where the average evoked EPSC amplitude is given by $\\langle I \\rangle = N p q$. Here, $N$ is the number of available synaptic release sites, $p$ is the probability of vesicular release at a given site, and $q$ is the postsynaptic current produced by a single quantum (a single vesicle of neurotransmitter), known as the quantal size. For short-term plasticity and acute drug effects, $N$ is typically assumed to be constant. Therefore, a change in $\\langle I \\rangle$ must be due to a change in $p$ (a presynaptic change) or a change in $q$ (a postsynaptic change).\n\nWe will analyze each piece of experimental evidence:\n\n1.  **EPSC Amplitude Increase ($25\\%$):** The application of AM251 causes $\\langle I \\rangle$ to increase. This could be due to an increase in $p$ or an increase in $q$. AM251 is a CB$_1$ antagonist/inverse agonist. According to the background information, activation of CB$_1$ receptors *suppresses* glutamate release. Therefore, blocking these receptors should relieve this suppression, leading to an *increase* in glutamate release. This implies an increase in the presynaptic release probability, $p$. The observation is consistent with this presynaptic hypothesis.\n\n2.  **Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR) Decrease (from $1.9$ to $1.5$):** PPR is known to be inversely correlated with the release probability $p$. When $p$ is high, the first stimulus depletes a significant fraction of the readily releasable pool of vesicles, leaving fewer vesicles available for the second stimulus, resulting in a low PPR (paired-pulse depression). Conversely, a low $p$ results in a high PPR. The observed decrease in PPR from $1.9$ (a value indicating paired-pulse facilitation, typical of low-$p$ synapses) to $1.5$ is strong evidence for an increase in the presynaptic release probability $p$. This observation strongly supports a presynaptic locus of action for AM251.\n\n3.  **mEPSC Amplitude Unchanged (within $\\pm 2\\%$):** Miniature EPSCs reflect the postsynaptic response to the spontaneous, stochastic release of single quanta of neurotransmitter. The amplitude of mEPSCs provides a direct measurement of the quantal size, $q$. The fact that mEPSC amplitude remains unchanged indicates that $q$ is constant. This is powerful evidence *against* a postsynaptic locus of action, which would involve a change in the number or function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, thereby altering $q$.\n\n4.  **mEPSC Frequency Increase (by $\\approx 20\\%$):** The frequency of mEPSCs is related to the probability of spontaneous vesicular fusion, which is a presynaptic process. Changes in the presynaptic release machinery that increase the evoked release probability $p$ also often lead to an increase in the spontaneous release frequency. The observed $\\approx 20\\%$ increase in mEPSC frequency is therefore consistent with a presynaptic enhancement of the release process and aligns well with the increase in evoked EPSC amplitude and the decrease in PPR.\n\n5.  **Stable $R_s$ and $R_{in}$:** The stability of the series resistance ($R_s$) and input resistance ($R_{in}$) is a critical experimental control. It rules out the possibility that the observed increase in EPSC amplitude is an artifact of improved voltage clamp (e.g., lower $R_s$) or a change in the overall membrane properties of the postsynaptic neuron. This technical stability lends confidence to the biological interpretation of the other data.\n\n6.  **Unchanged Reversal Potential:** Stability of the EPSC reversal potential indicates that the ionic permeability and selectivity of the underlying postsynaptic glutamate receptors have not been altered by the drug. This further supports the conclusion that the primary drug effect is not on the postsynaptic receptors' fundamental properties.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe combined evidence points unequivocally to a presynaptic mechanism. The decrease in PPR and the increase in mEPSC frequency are classic signatures of an increase in presynaptic release probability, $p$. The unchanged mEPSC amplitude is the classic signature of a stable postsynaptic quantal size, $q$. The stability of passive electrical properties rules out major experimental artifacts. Therefore, AM251 acts by blocking presynaptic CB$_1$ receptors, which disinhibits transmitter release, causing an increase in $p$. This leads to larger evoked EPSCs, a lower PPR, and a higher mEPSC frequency, all while mEPSC amplitude remains constant. This confirms the presynaptic role of CB$_1$ receptors in mediating retrograde signaling.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The $25\\%$ increase in EPSC amplitude with AM251, the decrease in PPR from $1.9$ to $1.5$, the unchanged mEPSC amplitude, and increased mEPSC frequency together indicate an increase in presynaptic release probability $p$ (consistent with blockade of presynaptic CB$_1$ receptors), while constant $R_s$ and $R_{in}$ argue against artifactual changes in driving force or space clamp; thus postsynaptic receptor efficacy $q$ is unlikely to be the primary locus.**\nThis statement correctly integrates all lines of evidence. It correctly links decreased PPR and increased mEPSC frequency to increased $p$. It correctly links unchanged mEPSC amplitude to unchanged $q$. It correctly interprets the role of stable $R_s$ and $R_{in}$. The conclusion that the locus is presynaptic and postsynaptic changes are unlikely is rigorously supported by the data and first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The $25\\%$ increase in EPSC amplitude with AM251 is best explained by postsynaptic potentiation of $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, because an increase in $q$ would reduce PPR from $1.9$ to $1.5$ and increase mEPSC frequency without affecting $p$, which aligns with the observations.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. An increase in $q$ (postsynaptic potentiation) would cause an *increase* in mEPSC amplitude, which directly contradicts the observation that mEPSC amplitude was unchanged. Furthermore, a change in postsynaptic $q$ does not cause changes in the presynaptically determined PPR or mEPSC frequency. The assertion that increased $q$ reduces PPR and increases mEPSC frequency is incorrect based on the provided background and fundamental synaptic physiology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Stability of $R_s$ and $R_{in}$ alone proves that the effect of AM251 is presynaptic; therefore no additional analyses (PPR or mEPSCs) are necessary to rule out postsynaptic receptor changes.**\nThis statement oversimplifies the interpretation. Stable $R_s$ and $R_{in}$ rule out certain *technical artifacts* but do not, by themselves, distinguish between a presynaptic biological mechanism (change in $p$) and a postsynaptic biological mechanism (change in $q$). A change in postsynaptic receptor efficacy could occur without altering the cell's overall input resistance. The analyses of PPR and mEPSCs are absolutely essential for making this distinction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The most parsimonious explanation is that AM251 improves space clamp quality, effectively increasing the postsynaptic driving force for glutamatergic currents by approximately $25\\%$, which would increase the EPSC amplitude and decrease PPR even if transmitter release were unchanged; thus the data do not support a presynaptic CB$_1$ mechanism.**\nThis statement is contradicted by the evidence. Firstly, the problem explicitly states that $R_s$ is stable, which argues against a significant change in space clamp quality. Secondly, and more decisively, an increase in driving force would scale all currents proportionally, including the quantal current. This would lead to an *increase* in mEPSC amplitude, which was not observed. The data show mEPSC amplitude was stable. Finally, a postsynaptic artifact would not explain the a increase in mEPSC frequency, a presynaptic phenomenon.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2747168"}]}
