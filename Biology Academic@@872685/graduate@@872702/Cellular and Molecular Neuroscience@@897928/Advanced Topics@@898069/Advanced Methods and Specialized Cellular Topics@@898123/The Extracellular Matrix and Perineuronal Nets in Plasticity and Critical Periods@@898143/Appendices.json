In mechanistic terms, PNNs are dense extracellular matrix structures whose integrity relies on the cross-linking of the hyaluronan backbone by proteoglycans like aggrecan. The value of $f_{B}$ serves as a quantitative metric for the extent of PNN formation and stability. A higher $f_{B}$ implies a more densely cross-linked and structurally rigid PNN.\n\nPNNs are known to appear at the end of developmental critical periods, stabilizing established synaptic connections and restricting further large-scale plasticity. Therefore, a fractional occupancy of $0.3469$ signifies a moderately stable PNN, consistent with a mature neuronal circuit where plasticity is significantly dampened but not completely eliminated. The unoccupied sites ($1 - f_{B} \\approx 65.3\\%$) represent a potential reservoir for further stabilization if, for example, aggrecan expression increases, or a vulnerability to degradation if enzymatic activity (e.g., from matrix metalloproteinases) increases.

We only consider fixed points $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$ for which both coordinates lie in the interval $[0,1]$. A robust method to find all roots is to define a function $H(x^{\\ast})$ as the difference between the two sides of the equation and scan the interval $[0,1]$ for sign changes, using a precise root-finding algorithm such as Brent's method in each sub-interval where a root is bracketed.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis of Fixed Points**\n\nThe linear stability of each fixed point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$ is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$, which is the matrix of first partial derivatives of the system functions evaluated at that point:\n$$J(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe partial derivatives are calculated as follows:\n$$f(x,y) = r [x_b + sy - (x_b+d)x - (s-d)xy]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = r [-(x_b+d) - (s-d)y] = r[(d-s)y - (x_b+d)]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = r [s - (s-d)x] = r[s+(d-s)x]$$\n$$g(x,y) = k \\frac{x^n}{\\theta^n + x^n} - \\lambda y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = k \\frac{n \\theta^n x^{n-1}}{(\\theta^n + x^n)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -\\lambda$$\nFor a $2$-dimensional system, a fixed point is linearly stable if and only if the trace of the Jacobian is strictly negative and its determinant is strictly positive. These are the Routh-Hurwitz stability criteria.\n$$ \\text{tr}(J) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} < 0 $$\n$$ \\det(J) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} > 0 $$\nThese conditions ensure that the real parts of both eigenvalues of the Jacobian are negative.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Procedure**\n\nFor each given parameter set, we execute the following steps:\n1.  Define the function $H(x) = \\frac{k}{\\lambda} \\frac{x^n}{\\theta^n+x^n} - \\frac{(d+x_b)x-x_b}{s+(d-s)x}$.\n2.  Numerically find all roots $x^{\\ast}$ of $H(x) = 0$ in the interval $[0,1]$.\n3.  For each root $x^{\\ast}$, compute the corresponding $y^{\\ast}$ and retain the pair $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$ if it lies within the domain $[0,1]^2$.\n4.  For each valid fixed point, compute the Jacobian matrix $J(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$.\n5.  Evaluate the trace and determinant of $J$. If $\\text{tr}(J) < 0$ and $\\det(J) > 0$, the fixed point is classified as stable.\n6.  Count the number of stable fixed points, $m$. If $m \\ge 2$, the system is declared bistable.\n7.  Collect the $y^{\\ast}$ coordinates of all stable fixed points and determine the minimum ($y_{\\min}$) and maximum ($y_{\\max}$) values, rounding them to three decimal places. If only one stable fixed point exists, $y_{\\min} = y_{\\max}$.\n8.  Assemble the required output: the bistability indicator ($1$ for bistable, $0$ otherwise), the count $m$, and the values $y_{\\min}$ and $y_{\\max}$.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef analyze_system(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dynamical system for a given set of parameters.\n\n    This function finds fixed points, classifies their stability, and determines\n    if the system is bistable.\n\n    Args:\n        params (tuple): A tuple of parameters (r, xb, s, d, k, theta, n, lam).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing [bistability_indicator, num_stable_points,\n               min_stable_y, max_stable_y].\n    \"\"\"\n    r, xb, s, d, k, theta, n, lam = params\n\n    # Nullcline definitions\n    # y-nullcline from dy/dt = 0: y = (k/lam) * x^n / (theta^n + x^n)\n    def y_nullcline(x):\n        if x == 0:\n            return 0.0\n        return (k / lam) * (x**n) / (theta**n + x**n)\n\n    # x-nullcline from dx/dt = 0: y = ((d+xb)*x - xb) / (s + (d-s)*x)\n    def x_nullcline_y(x):\n        # Denominator is always positive for x in [0,1] as s,d > 0\n        return ((d + xb) * x - xb) / (s + (d-s)*x)\n\n    # Function whose roots are the x-coordinates of the fixed points\n    def root_func(x):\n        # Find x where y_nullcline(x) == x_nullcline_y(x)\n        if x < 0 or x > 1:\n            return 1e12  # Penalize searching outside domain\n        return y_nullcline(x) - x_nullcline_y(x)\n\n    # Find all roots of H(x) = 0 in [0, 1] by scanning and using brentq\n    roots = []\n    # Using a 10001-point grid (10000 intervals) is robust for these functions\n    grid_points = np.linspace(0, 1, 10001)\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid_points) - 1):\n        x1, x2 = grid_points[i], grid_points[i+1]\n        try:\n            val1 = root_func(x1)\n            val2 = root_func(x2)\n            if np.sign(val1) != np.sign(val2):\n                root = brentq(root_func, x1, x2)\n                # Add root if it's not a duplicate of a previously found one\n                if not any(np.isclose(root, r) for r in roots):\n                    roots.append(root)\n        except ValueError:\n            # Can occur if a root is exactly on a grid point; continue\n            continue\n    \n    # Process found roots to get valid fixed points in [0,1]^2\n    fixed_points = []\n    for x_star in sorted(roots):\n        y_star = y_nullcline(x_star)\n        if 0.0 <= x_star <= 1.0 and 0.0 <= y_star <= 1.0:\n            fixed_points.append((x_star, y_star))\n            \n    # Stability analysis for each valid fixed point\n    stable_points_y_coords = []\n    for x_star, y_star in fixed_points:\n        # Jacobian elements at (x_star, y_star)\n        # J_11 = df/dx, J_12 = df/dy, J_21 = dg/dx, J_22 = dg/dy\n        \n        j11 = r * ((d - s) * y_star - (xb + d))\n        j12 = r * (s + (d - s) * x_star)\n        if x_star == 0.0:\n            j21 = 0.0 if n > 1 else k * n * theta**n / (theta**n + x_star**n)**2\n        else:\n            j21 = (k * n * theta**n * x_star**(n - 1.0)) / (theta**n + x_star**n)**2.0\n        j22 = -lam\n\n        # Stability criteria for 2D systems: tr(J) < 0 and det(J) > 0\n        trace = j11 + j22\n        determinant = j11 * j22 - j12 * j21\n        \n        if trace < 0 and determinant > 0:\n            stable_points_y_coords.append(y_star)\n\n    num_stable = len(stable_points_y_coords)\n    is_bistable = 1 if num_stable >= 2 else 0\n\n    if num_stable > 0:\n        y_min = min(stable_points_y_coords)\n        y_max = max(stable_points_y_coords)\n    else:\n        # Fallback if no stable points found, though not expected for these systems\n        y_min = 0.0\n        y_max = 0.0\n\n    return [is_bistable, num_stable, round(y_min, 3), round(y_max, 3)]\n\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run all test cases and print the final output.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (general, potentially bistable)\n        (1.0, 0.02, 2.2, 0.8, 0.9, 0.45, 6, 0.9),\n        # Case 2 (weak PNN feedback)\n        (1.0, 0.02, 0.2, 0.8, 0.7, 0.45, 6, 0.9),\n        # Case 3 (high net clearance)\n        (1.0, 0.02, 2.2, 0.8, 0.4, 0.45, 6, 1.2),\n        # Case 4 (strong feedback and steeper Hill)\n        (1.0, 0.02, 3.0, 0.6, 0.9, 0.35, 8, 0.9),\n        # Case 5 (shifted activation threshold)\n        (1.0, 0.02, 1.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.50, 10, 0.9),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        result = analyze_system(params)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "answer": "[[1, 2, 0.045, 0.899],[0, 1, 0.024, 0.024],[0, 1, 0.025, 0.025],[1, 2, 0.038, 0.899],[1, 2, 0.021, 0.899]]", "id": "2763166"}]}
