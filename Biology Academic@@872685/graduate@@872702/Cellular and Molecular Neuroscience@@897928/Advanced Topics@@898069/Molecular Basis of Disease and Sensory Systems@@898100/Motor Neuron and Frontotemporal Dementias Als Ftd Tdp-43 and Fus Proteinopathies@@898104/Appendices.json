The concepts of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), UCST behavior, the virial expansion of osmotic pressure, and their connection to proteinopathies like ALS and FTD are all well-established and subjects of active research in biophysics and molecular neuroscience. The specified values for $B_2$ are physically plausible for protein solutions under conditions favoring self-association.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for a qualitative prediction of a change in a phase diagram based on a specified change in a key thermodynamic parameter, $B_2$. The provided theoretical bases are sufficient to deduce a unique qualitative answer.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The information is self-contained and sufficient for the required qualitative analysis. There are no internal contradictions. The change in $B_2$ is clearly defined, and the type of phase behavior (UCST) is specified.\n5.  **Realism**: The scenario described—a point mutation altering protein-protein interactions and thus the propensity for phase separation—is a central mechanism in the study of FUS and TDP-$43$ proteinopathies.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that requires the application of fundamental principles of physical chemistry to a relevant biological system. We may proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core of the problem is to relate a change in a microscopic interaction parameter, the second virial coefficient $B_2$, to a macroscopic change in the phase diagram, specifically the binodal curve and the saturation concentration $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Change in $B_2$**: The problem states that the second virial coefficient $B_2$ changes from $-1\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$ to $-2\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$. According to the provided basis (ii), a negative $B_2$ indicates net attractive interactions between the protein molecules. The change from $-1$ to $-2\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$ signifies that $B_2$ has become more negative. This implies that the net attractive forces between the protein molecules have become stronger as a result of the mutation.\n\n2.  **Effect on Phase Separation Propensity**: Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a thermodynamic process driven by a balance between enthalpic gains from favorable molecular interactions and entropic losses from demixing. Stronger attractive interactions favor phase separation. Therefore, the mutation, by increasing the net attraction, makes the system more prone to demixing and phase separation. This means that the two-phase coexistence region in the system's phase diagram must expand.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the UCST Phase Diagram**: The problem specifies that the system exhibits Upper Critical Solution Temperature (UCST) behavior. In a UCST phase diagram, temperature ($T$) is plotted against concentration ($c$). The system exists as a single, homogeneous phase at temperatures *above* the binodal curve and separates into two coexisting phases (a protein-dilute phase and a protein-dense phase) at temperatures *below* the binodal curve. The binodal curve itself is typically U-shaped, with its peak defining the critical point ($T_c$, $c_c$).\n\n4.  **Shifting of the Binodal Curve**: Since the mutation makes phase separation more favorable, the system will now phase-separate over a wider range of conditions.\n    -   **Temperature Shift**: For a UCST system, enhanced attraction means that phase separation will persist up to higher temperatures. The thermal energy required to overcome the attractive forces and homogenize the solution is now greater. Consequently, the critical temperature $T_c$ must increase, and the entire binodal curve shifts upwards to higher temperatures.\n    -   **Concentration Shift**: The increased propensity for phase separation also means that demixing will occur at lower concentrations. The saturation concentration, $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, is the concentration of the dilute phase at equilibrium, which corresponds to the left-hand branch of the binodal curve. As the two-phase region expands, this left branch must shift to the left, i.e., toward lower concentrations. Symmetrically, the right-hand branch (representing the dense phase) shifts to the right, toward higher concentrations. The overall effect is a widening of the binodal curve.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$**: A direct consequence of the binodal curve shifting up and widening is that, for any given temperature $T$ within the original two-phase region, the new saturation concentration $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ will be lower than the original one. The system now requires a smaller concentration of protein in the dilute phase to become saturated and initiate phase separation.\n\nIn summary, the mutation that makes $B_2$ more negative leads to an **expansion of the two-phase region**. For a UCST system, this manifests as a shift of the binodal curve to **higher temperatures** and a **widening** of the concentration range for phase separation. This widening entails a shift of the dilute branch to **lower concentrations**, meaning that **$c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ decreases** at a fixed temperature.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The binodal shifts toward lower protein concentrations and higher temperatures (expanded two-phase region for a UCST system), and $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ decreases at fixed temperature.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement correctly identifies that the binodal shifts to higher temperatures. It correctly notes that the boundary shifts toward lower protein concentrations, which accurately describes the change in the saturation concentration of the dilute phase ($c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$). It correctly identifies this as an expansion of the two-phase region for a UCST system. Finally, it correctly concludes that $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ decreases at a fixed temperature. All parts of this statement are consistent with our derivation.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The binodal shifts toward higher protein concentrations and lower temperatures (contracted two-phase region), and $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ increases at fixed temperature.**\n- **Analysis**: This describes a contraction of the two-phase region. The shifts in both temperature (lower) and concentration (higher $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$) are the opposite of what is expected for increased molecular attraction.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The binodal shifts toward higher protein concentrations and higher temperatures, and $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ increases at fixed temperature.**\n- **Analysis**: While the shift to higher temperatures is correct, the claim that the binodal shifts toward higher protein concentrations (implying an increase in $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$) is incorrect. Increased attraction lowers the saturation concentration.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The binodal remains essentially unchanged because $B_2$ was already negative, so $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ is unchanged.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement is based on a flawed premise. The *magnitude* of the interaction energy, not just its sign, determines the boundaries of the phase diagram. A change in $B_2$ from $-1$ to $-2\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$ is a significant strengthening of attraction that must alter the phase boundary.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The binodal shifts toward lower temperatures and lower protein concentrations, and $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ decreases at fixed temperature.**\n- **Analysis**: The shift toward lower temperatures is incorrect for a UCST system; this would describe the behavior for a system with a Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) where stronger attractions also expand the two-phase region (which is at high T for LCST). Although the conclusion about $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ is correct, the temperature shift is wrong.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2732070"}, {"introduction": "One of the defining pathological hallmarks of ALS and FTD is the depletion of TDP-43 from the nucleus and its accumulation in the cytoplasm, a mislocalization that disrupts numerous critical cellular functions.
