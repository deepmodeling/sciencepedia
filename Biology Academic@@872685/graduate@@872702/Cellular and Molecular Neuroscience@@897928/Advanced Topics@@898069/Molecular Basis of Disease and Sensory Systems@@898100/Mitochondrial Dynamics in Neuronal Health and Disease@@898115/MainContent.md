## Introduction
Neurons are the most energetically demanding cells in the body, requiring a constant and precisely distributed supply of ATP to power information processing across vast and complex cellular architectures. This immense [metabolic burden](@entry_id:155212) is shouldered by mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses. However, their role extends far beyond simple energy production. Mitochondria form a highly dynamic network that is constantly reshaped by fusion and fission, actively transported to locations of need, and subjected to rigorous quality control to remove damaged components. Understanding this intricate system of [mitochondrial dynamics](@entry_id:148071) is fundamental to comprehending neuronal function.

This article addresses the critical knowledge gap between the molecular machinery of [mitochondrial dynamics](@entry_id:148071) and its system-level consequences for neuronal health and disease. It seeks to explain how the life cycle of a mitochondrion—from its [biogenesis](@entry_id:177915) and transport to its eventual removal—is uniquely adapted to the challenges of the nervous system and how a breakdown in this system becomes a central feature in the [pathology](@entry_id:193640) of devastating [neurodegenerative disorders](@entry_id:183807).

To provide a comprehensive overview, this article is structured into three chapters. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** will delve into the core molecular machinery, exploring the biophysics of mitochondrial architecture, the proteins that drive fission and fusion, the motor-adaptor complexes of [axonal transport](@entry_id:154150), and the pathways of [biogenesis](@entry_id:177915) and quality control. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** will apply these fundamental principles to explain how [mitochondrial dynamics](@entry_id:148071) support synaptic function and how their failure contributes to the progression of diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Finally, **"Hands-On Practices"** will offer a series of challenges to solidify your understanding through quantitative modeling and [experimental design](@entry_id:142447).

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Energetic Imperative in Neurons

Neurons are among the most energetically demanding cells in the body, a consequence of their unique roles in information processing and transmission. The maintenance of steep [ion gradients](@entry_id:185265) across vast membrane surfaces and the dynamic processes of synaptic communication impose a continuous and substantial requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Understanding the scale of this demand is fundamental to appreciating the central role of [mitochondrial function](@entry_id:141000) in neuronal health.

A quantitative model of a typical cortical neuron can illuminate the allocation of its energy budget [@problem_id:2726794]. The total ATP demand can be deconstructed into three primary components: maintaining the resting [membrane potential](@entry_id:150996), propagating action potentials, and supporting synaptic activity.

1.  **Maintenance of Resting Potential:** Even at rest, neurons continuously expend energy to counteract the passive leak of ions across their membranes, primarily through the action of the $\mathrm{Na^+/K^+}$ ATPase. For a typical pyramidal neuron with a soma-dendritic membrane area of $2.0 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ and a resting sodium leak [current density](@entry_id:190690) of $0.02\,\mu\mathrm{A/cm^2}$, the pump must extrude approximately $2.5 \times 10^8$ $\mathrm{Na^+}$ ions per second. Given the stoichiometry of $3\,\mathrm{Na^+}$ ions per ATP hydrolyzed, this basal maintenance consumes roughly $8.3 \times 10^7$ ATP molecules per second.

2.  **Action Potential Propagation:** Each action potential involves a massive, transient influx of $\mathrm{Na^+}$ ions down their electrochemical gradient. To restore the gradient, these ions must be pumped back out. For an [unmyelinated axon](@entry_id:172364) of $1\,\mathrm{cm}$ length and $0.5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ diameter, firing at a modest $10\,\mathrm{Hz}$, the ATP cost is staggering. The minimal charge required to depolarize the membrane by $100\,\mathrm{mV}$ is compounded by the overlap of $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{K^+}$ currents during the spike, resulting in a four-fold greater effective $\mathrm{Na^+}$ entry. Restoring the ionic balance after each spike requires the hydrolysis of approximately $1.3 \times 10^8$ ATP molecules. At a $10\,\mathrm{Hz}$ [firing rate](@entry_id:275859), this translates to an ATP demand of $1.3 \times 10^9$ ATP/s.

3.  **Synaptic Transmission:** The cycle of neurotransmitter release—involving [vesicle fusion](@entry_id:163232), endocytosis, and re-acidification—is also energetically costly. For a neuron with $10^4$ presynaptic terminals, each firing with a probability of $0.1$ per action potential, a $10\,\mathrm{Hz}$ spike train triggers the cycling of $10^4$ vesicles per second. If each cycle consumes about $800$ ATP molecules, this activity adds another $8.0 \times 10^6$ ATP/s to the total demand.

Summing these components, a single neuron under moderate activity can consume approximately $1.4 \times 10^9$ ATP molecules per second [@problem_id:2726794]. The majority of this demand, over $90\%$ in this model, is driven by the costs of [action potential propagation](@entry_id:154135). This immense energy requirement is met primarily by mitochondrial **[oxidative phosphorylation](@entry_id:140461) (OXPHOS)**, a highly efficient process that can generate up to 30-36 ATP per molecule of glucose. Cytosolic **glycolysis**, which produces only 2 ATP per glucose, serves as a rapid, but far less efficient, supplementary source. In our model neuron, with typical metabolic capacities, OXPHOS would run at its maximum rate, supplying approximately $1.2 \times 10^9$ ATP/s (about $86\%$), with glycolysis providing the remaining $14\%$. This heavy reliance on [mitochondrial respiration](@entry_id:151925) underscores why mitochondrial health, number, and distribution are paramount for sustaining neuronal function.

### Mitochondrial Architecture: From Internal Cristae to External Contacts

#### Cristae Structure and Diffusion Barriers

The mitochondrion's ability to perform its bioenergetic and signaling functions is intimately linked to its intricate internal architecture. The **[inner mitochondrial membrane](@entry_id:175557) (IMM)** is not a simple sac but is elaborately folded into structures called **cristae**, which house the components of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. These [cristae](@entry_id:168373) are connected to the peripheral region of the IMM, known as the inner boundary membrane, via narrow, highly curved tubular structures called **cristae junctions** [@problem_id:2726781].

The shape and stability of these junctions are actively maintained by specific [protein complexes](@entry_id:269238). The **Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS)** is a large IMM complex that acts as a scaffold, organizing the IMM into [cristae](@entry_id:168373) and anchoring them to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Depletion of MICOS components leads to profound disruption of [cristae](@entry_id:168373) architecture, often resulting in detached, lamellar [cristae](@entry_id:168373) and a loss of defined junctions. Another key player is **Optic Atrophy protein 1 (OPA1)**, a [dynamin](@entry_id:153881)-related GTPase in the IMM whose oligomerization is critical for constricting [cristae](@entry_id:168373) junctions and maintaining their narrow diameter [@problem_id:2726776] [@problem_id:2726781].

This specific architecture has profound biophysical consequences.
- **Diffusion Barrier for Solutes:** The narrow [cristae](@entry_id:168373) junctions act as a significant [diffusion barrier](@entry_id:148409), partially sequestering the contents of the cristae lumen from the bulk intermembrane space (IMS). This is particularly important for the pro-apoptotic factor **cytochrome c**. Under normal conditions, [cytochrome c](@entry_id:137384) is confined within the cristae. The time constant for its equilibration with the IMS is inversely proportional to the square of the junction radius ($r_j$), i.e., $\tau \propto 1/r_j^2$. The widening of these junctions, for instance through stress-induced cleavage of OPA1, dramatically speeds the release of [cytochrome c](@entry_id:137384) into the cytosol, a critical step in initiating apoptosis [@problem_id:2726781].
- **Confinement of Protein Complexes:** The high [membrane curvature](@entry_id:173843) at the cristae rims is preferentially occupied by **ATP synthase dimers**, which themselves induce and stabilize this curvature. The saddle-shaped negative curvature at the [cristae](@entry_id:168373) junction imposes a significant energetic penalty for these large protein assemblies to traverse it. The probability of crossing is suppressed by a Boltzmann factor, $\exp(-\Delta E / k_B T)$, effectively confining the ATP synthase dimer rows within the cristae and away from the inner boundary membrane. This organization optimizes the [proton gradient](@entry_id:154755) for ATP synthesis.

#### Mitochondria-Associated ER Membranes (MAMs)

In addition to their internal structure, mitochondria form extensive physical contacts with other [organelles](@entry_id:154570), most notably the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These regions of close apposition, known as **mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)**, are not sites of [membrane fusion](@entry_id:152357) but rather nanoscale platforms (10–30 nm separation) that facilitate inter-organellar communication and [metabolic channeling](@entry_id:170331) [@problem_id:2726788]. It is crucial to distinguish between the **structural tethers** that create these contacts and the **functional conduits** that mediate molecular transfer.

- **Structural Tethers:** These are [protein complexes](@entry_id:269238) that physically bridge the two [organelles](@entry_id:154570). Examples in neurons include **PDZ domain-containing protein 8 (PDZD8)**, an ER-resident protein that tethers mitochondria, and the **VAPB–PTPIP51** complex, where VAPB on the ER binds to PTPIP51 on the OMM. The primary role of these tethers is architectural: to establish and maintain the proximity and surface area of the ER-mitochondria interface.

- **Functional Conduits:** These are molecular assemblies that exploit the proximity established by tethers to mediate efficient transfer of molecules.
    - **Calcium ($\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$) Transfer:** MAMs create cytosolic microdomains where $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ released from the ER can reach very high concentrations (tens of micromolars). This is achieved by the [colocalization](@entry_id:187613) of ER $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ release channels, such as the **Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)**, with OMM channels like the **Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC)**. This functional conduit is often physically coupled by the chaperone **GRP75**, forming an **IP3R–GRP75–VDAC** triad that efficiently funnels $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ from the ER lumen to the mitochondrial intermembrane space [@problem_id:2726788].
    - **Lipid Transfer:** MAMs are also hotspots for non-vesicular [lipid transport](@entry_id:169769). For example, **[phosphatidylserine](@entry_id:172518) (PS)** is synthesized in the ER, transferred across the MAM interface to the mitochondrion, where it is decarboxylated by an enzyme on the IMM to form **phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)**.

These contact sites are thus critical hubs that integrate [mitochondrial function](@entry_id:141000) with [cellular signaling](@entry_id:152199) and metabolism, and as we will see, they also serve as initiation sites for [mitochondrial fission](@entry_id:160102).

### The Dynamic Mitochondrial Network: Fission, Fusion, and Transport

Mitochondria are not static, isolated [organelles](@entry_id:154570) but exist as a highly dynamic and interconnected network that is constantly remodeled by the opposing processes of fusion and fission. This dynamism, coupled with active transport, allows the cell to adapt the mitochondrial population's [morphology](@entry_id:273085), number, and position to meet local metabolic demands and to maintain organellar quality.

#### Mitochondrial Fusion: Maintaining Network Integrity

Mitochondrial fusion is a two-step process that allows for the merging of two distinct mitochondria, enabling the exchange of matrix contents, mtDNA, and membrane components. This process is crucial for buffering against functional defects, as a healthy mitochondrion can complement a damaged one, restoring its function.

1.  **Outer Membrane Fusion:** This step is mediated by the [dynamin](@entry_id:153881)-related GTPases **Mitofusin 1 (MFN1)** and **Mitofusin 2 (MFN2)**. These proteins are anchored in the OMM of adjacent mitochondria and engage in *trans* to form a tethering complex. Subsequent GTP hydrolysis drives conformational changes that bring the two outer membranes into close proximity and catalyze their merger [@problem_id:2726776].

2.  **Inner Membrane Fusion:** Following OMM fusion, the inner membranes are fused by **Optic Atrophy protein 1 (OPA1)**. OPA1 is a [dynamin](@entry_id:153881)-related GTPase anchored to the IMM. Its function is tightly regulated by proteolytic processing. OPA1 exists in both long, membrane-anchored forms (L-OPA1) and short, soluble forms (S-OPA1) in the IMS. Efficient IMM fusion requires a precise, balanced ratio of L-OPA1 and S-OPA1. Under homeostatic conditions, the i-AAA protease **YME1L** performs constitutive processing of L-OPA1 to generate the necessary pool of S-OPA1. However, upon cellular stress that leads to the collapse of the [mitochondrial membrane potential](@entry_id:174191) ($\Delta \Psi_m$), the stress-activated metalloprotease **OMA1** is activated. OMA1 rapidly cleaves L-OPA1, disrupting the L-OPA1/S-OPA1 balance. This shift not only potently inhibits inner [membrane fusion](@entry_id:152357), leading to mitochondrial fragmentation, but also dismantles the OPA1 oligomers that maintain tight cristae junctions, facilitating the release of cytochrome c and promoting apoptosis [@problem_id:2726776].

#### Mitochondrial Fission: Enabling Distribution and Segregation

Mitochondrial fission is the process by which a single mitochondrion divides into two. Fission is essential for generating smaller mitochondrial units that can be transported into distal processes like axons, for segregating damaged mitochondrial components for subsequent removal, and for facilitating cell division. In neurons, fission is a sophisticated, multi-step process [@problem_id:2726773].

1.  **Pre-constriction at ER-Mitochondria Contacts:** Fission events are often initiated at MAMs. ER tubules wrap around the mitochondrion and, in conjunction with localized [actin polymerization](@entry_id:156489) nucleated by **Inverted Formin 2 (INF2)**, apply a compressive force. This creates an initial constriction on the mitochondrion, lowering the energetic barrier for the subsequent steps.

2.  **DRP1 Recruitment and Assembly:** The central player in fission is **Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP1)**, a large cytosolic GTPase. Upon receiving a signal, DRP1 is recruited from the cytosol to the OMM at the pre-constricted site. Here, it oligomerizes into a ring or spiral around the mitochondrial tubule.

3.  **Scission:** The DRP1 ring constricts the mitochondrion in a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent manner, providing the mechanical force to sever both the outer and inner membranes, completing the division process.

The recruitment of DRP1 to the OMM is a critical regulatory step governed by several receptor proteins. In mammals, **Mitochondrial Fission Factor (MFF)** is considered the principal receptor for recruiting DRP1 and promoting the assembly of productive, fission-competent rings. Other receptors, such as **Mitochondrial Dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49/51)**, can also recruit DRP1, but their overexpression can lead to the formation of non-productive puncta without increasing the fission rate, suggesting they may act as modulators or sequester DRP1 in certain contexts. The protein **FIS1**, once thought to be a primary DRP1 receptor, is now understood to play a more prominent role in stress-induced fission and [mitophagy](@entry_id:151568) rather than in basal homeostatic fission [@problem_id:2726773].

#### Axonal Transport: Positioning Mitochondria in a Polarized Cell

The extreme polarity of neurons, with [axons](@entry_id:193329) that can extend for meters, presents a formidable logistical challenge for distributing mitochondria. Active transport along the [axonal cytoskeleton](@entry_id:181497) is essential to deliver mitochondria to sites of high energy demand, such as nodes of Ranvier, growth cones, and presynaptic terminals.

The core transport machinery consists of [microtubule](@entry_id:165292) tracks and [motor proteins](@entry_id:140902) [@problem_id:2726811]. Axonal microtubules are uniformly polarized, with their plus ($+$) ends pointing distally toward the axon terminal and their minus ($-$) ends toward the soma.
- **Anterograde transport** (soma to terminal) is driven by the motor protein **kinesin-1** (also known as KIF5), which walks toward the [microtubule](@entry_id:165292)'s $+$ end.
- **Retrograde transport** (terminal to soma) is driven by the motor protein **[cytoplasmic dynein](@entry_id:185004)**, which moves toward the $-$ end.

Mitochondria do not bind directly to these motors. Instead, they utilize a specialized adaptor complex. The central components are the **Miro1/2** proteins (Mitochondrial Rho GTPases), which are anchored in the OMM. Miro, in turn, binds to the **trafficking kinesin protein (TRAK)** adaptors, **TRAK1** and **TRAK2**. These TRAK proteins act as scaffolds, simultaneously binding to Miro on the mitochondrion and to the [motor proteins](@entry_id:140902). While both TRAKs can bind both motor types, evidence suggests a degree of specialization: TRAK1 appears to preferentially support [anterograde transport](@entry_id:163289) by functionally coupling to kinesin-1, while TRAK2 shows a bias towards [dynein](@entry_id:163710)-mediated retrograde motility [@problem_id:2726811]. The net direction of movement emerges from a dynamic "tug-of-war" regulated by the engagement and activity of these opposing motors.

#### Regulation of Transport by Calcium: The "Activity-Dependent Brake"

Axonal [mitochondrial transport](@entry_id:170964) is not constitutive; it is exquisitely regulated by local neuronal activity. A key mechanism for this regulation is the "calcium brake," which ensures that mitochondria pause at sites of high metabolic demand [@problem_id:2726811].

The Miro protein is the key sensor in this process. Its cytosolic domain contains two **EF-hand motifs**, which are canonical $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-binding structures. During periods of high neuronal activity, such as at a presynaptic terminal during a spike train, local influx of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ through [voltage-gated channels](@entry_id:143901) creates a microdomain of high calcium concentration (reaching several micromolars). When the local $[\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]$ exceeds the [dissociation constant](@entry_id:265737) ($K_d$) of Miro's EF-hands (typically $\sim 1\,\mu\mathrm{M}$), $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binding induces a [conformational change](@entry_id:185671) in Miro. This change is propagated through the adaptor complex, leading to the detachment of the [kinesin](@entry_id:164343) motor from the microtubule, thereby arresting mitochondrial motility.

This mechanism ensures that motile mitochondria passing through a zone of high activity are captured and immobilized precisely where their products—ATP and $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ [buffering capacity](@entry_id:167128)—are most needed. The spatial extent of this arrest zone is determined by the reaction-diffusion dynamics of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ in the axon. The steady-state concentration profile of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ decays exponentially from its source, creating a localized domain of arrest whose size depends on the diffusion coefficient of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, the rate of its removal by pumps and [buffers](@entry_id:137243), and the strength of the source [@problem_id:2726789].

### Integrated Systems of Biogenesis and Quality Control

The maintenance of a healthy and responsive mitochondrial network requires not only dynamic remodeling and transport but also sophisticated systems for creating new [organelles](@entry_id:154570) ([biogenesis](@entry_id:177915)) and removing old or damaged ones (quality control).

#### Mitochondrial Biogenesis: Coordinating Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genomes

Mitochondrial [biogenesis](@entry_id:177915) is the process by which new mitochondria are generated. It requires the coordinated expression of over 1,000 proteins. While the mitochondrion has its own small circular genome (mtDNA) that encodes 13 essential subunits of the OXPHOS complexes, the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes, and subsequently imported into the organelle.

The master regulator of this process is the transcriptional coactivator **Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1$\alpha$)**. In response to signals such as exercise, low temperature, or increased metabolic demand, PGC-1$\alpha$ activity is induced in the nucleus. It then partners with transcription factors, notably **Nuclear Respiratory Factors 1 and 2 (NRF1/2)**, to drive the expression of a broad suite of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes [@problem_id:2726766].

A crucial target of this pathway is **Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM)**. TFAM is synthesized in the cytosol, imported into the [mitochondrial matrix](@entry_id:152264), and is essential for both the replication and transcription of mtDNA. The PGC-1$\alpha$–NRF–TFAM axis thus provides a mechanism to coordinate the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.

In the polarized neuron, this coordination presents a logistical challenge. The assembly of functional OXPHOS complexes in a distal axon requires the stoichiometric matching of subunits arriving from two distinct sources: nuclear-encoded subunits delivered via [anterograde transport](@entry_id:163289) from the soma (or synthesized locally in the axon from transported mRNAs) and mitochondrially-encoded subunits synthesized *in situ*. As modeled in [@problem_id:2726766], the final assembly rate of new complexes is limited by the component in shortest supply. Upregulating somatic production via PGC-1$\alpha$ can boost the delivery of both nuclear-encoded subunits and TFAM (which in turn can increase local mtDNA copy number and expression), but the system remains constrained by whichever supply stream is limiting, highlighting the exquisite coordination required to maintain [mitochondrial function](@entry_id:141000) throughout the neuron.

#### The Mitochondrion as a Calcium Signaling Hub

As discussed, mitochondria are strategically positioned at MAMs to take up $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ released from the ER. This function is mediated by a dedicated set of [transport proteins](@entry_id:176617) on the IMM that allow the mitochondrion to act as a powerful local $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ buffer, shaping the amplitude and [spatiotemporal dynamics](@entry_id:201628) of cellular $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signals [@problem_id:2726807].

- **Calcium Uptake:** The primary pathway for rapid $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ influx into the [mitochondrial matrix](@entry_id:152264) is the **Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU)** complex. This is not a simple pore but a sophisticated, multi-subunit channel. **MCU** itself forms the $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-selective pore. Its activity is dependent on **EMRE**, an essential regulatory subunit in higher eukaryotes. Critically, the channel is regulated by the IMS-facing proteins **MICU1** and **MICU2**. These proteins are EF-hand-containing gatekeepers that sense the $[\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]$ in the intermembrane space. At low, resting cytosolic $[\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]$ ($\sim100\,\mathrm{nM}$), MICU1 keeps the MCU channel closed, preventing a futile and toxic influx of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ down its steep electrochemical gradient ($\Delta \Psi_m \approx -180\,\mathrm{mV}$). When local $[\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]$ rises into the micromolar range, as occurs at MAMs during signaling events, $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binding to MICU1 triggers a [conformational change](@entry_id:185671) that opens the MCU pore, allowing for rapid $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ sequestration. Loss of MICU1 leads to a "leaky" channel that takes up $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ even at low concentrations.

- **Calcium Efflux:** To maintain [homeostasis](@entry_id:142720), matrix $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ must be extruded. In neurons and other excitable cells, the primary efflux pathway is the **mitochondrial Sodium/Calcium/Lithium exchanger (NCLX)**. This [antiporter](@entry_id:138442) uses the electrochemical gradient of $\mathrm{Na^+}$ to drive the export of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ from the matrix.

This cycle of rapid, high-threshold uptake and slower efflux allows mitochondria to effectively buffer large, transient $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ loads, preventing cytosolic overload while also using the matrix $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signal to stimulate ATP synthesis by activating key dehydrogenases in the Krebs cycle.

#### Mitophagy: Selective Removal of Damaged Organelles

Mitochondria can be damaged by [oxidative stress](@entry_id:149102), leading to a loss of $\Delta \Psi_m$, impaired ATP production, and the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To maintain cellular health, these dysfunctional mitochondria must be selectively identified and eliminated. This process, known as **[mitophagy](@entry_id:151568)**, is a specialized form of autophagy. Two major, mechanistically distinct pathways mediate [mitophagy](@entry_id:151568) in neurons [@problem_id:2726780].

1.  **The PINK1-Parkin Pathway:** This is the best-characterized quality control pathway, triggered by a loss of [mitochondrial membrane potential](@entry_id:174191).
    - **Sensing Damage:** The kinase **PTEN Induced Putative Kinase 1 (PINK1)** is normally imported into healthy mitochondria and rapidly degraded. However, when $\Delta \Psi_m$ is lost, import is stalled, and full-length PINK1 accumulates on the OMM.
    - **Signal Amplification:** Stabilized PINK1 on the OMM acts as a beacon. It phosphorylates both the E3 ubiquitin [ligase](@entry_id:139297) **Parkin** and existing [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) molecules on the OMM at Ser65. This phosphorylation event activates Parkin, which then robustly ubiquitinates a wide range of OMM proteins, effectively "painting" the damaged mitochondrion with ubiquitin chains.
    - **Recruitment of Autophagy Machinery:** These ubiquitin chains are recognized by [selective autophagy](@entry_id:163896) receptors, primarily **Optineurin (OPTN)** and **NDP52**. These receptors bind to both ubiquitin on the mitochondrion and to **LC3** on the nascent [autophagosome](@entry_id:170259) (phagophore), thereby tethering the damaged organelle for engulfment and subsequent degradation in [lysosomes](@entry_id:168205).

2.  **Receptor-Mediated Mitophagy:** Other cellular stresses, such as hypoxia, can trigger [mitophagy](@entry_id:151568) through a pathway that is independent of PINK1 and Parkin.
    - **Induction of Receptors:** Hypoxia, via the transcription factor **HIF-1**, induces the expression of several proteins on the OMM that can function as direct [mitophagy](@entry_id:151568) receptors. These include **BNIP3**, **NIX**, and **FUNDC1**.
    - **Direct Recruitment:** These receptors all possess a conserved motif known as an **LC3-interacting region (LIR)**. The LIR allows them to bind directly to LC3 on the [autophagosome](@entry_id:170259), bypassing the need for a [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) signal. The activity of these receptors is often regulated by phosphorylation. For example, under [hypoxia](@entry_id:153785), FUNDC1 is activated by [dephosphorylation](@entry_id:175330), enabling its LIR to engage LC3 and initiate [mitophagy](@entry_id:151568).

These distinct pathways provide the neuron with a versatile toolkit to clear damaged mitochondria under different physiological and pathological conditions, forming the final step in the life cycle of [mitochondrial quality control](@entry_id:163671).
