A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is broken down into three parts: first, derive the production rate $v_{\\text{prod}}$; second, formulate the governing differential equation for $I(t)$; and third, solve this equation for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we determine the production rate of $\\text{IP}_{3}$, denoted $v_{\\text{prod}}$. The problem states that this rate is proportional to the receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, with a proportionality constant $k_{\\text{PLC}}$.\n$$v_{\\text{prod}} = k_{\\text{PLC}} \\theta$$\nFor time $t \\ge 0$, the ligand concentration is constant at $L = L_{0}$.

The rate of change of $I(t)$ is the difference between the production rate and the degradation rate. The production rate has been established. The degradation is a first-order process, so the degradation rate, $v_{\\text{deg}}$, is proportional to the current concentration $I(t)$:\n$$v_{\\text{deg}} = k_{\\text{deg}} I(t)$$\nThe net rate of change is thus:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = v_{\\text{prod}} - v_{\\text{deg}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = k_{\\text{PLC}} \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{D} + L_{0}} - k_{\\text{deg}} I(t)$$\nThis is the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $I(t)$. To solve it, we can rearrange the equation into standard form:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} + k_{\\text{deg}} I(t) = k_{\\text{PLC}} \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{D} + L_{0}}$$\nThis equation is of the general form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + P(t)y = Q(t)$, where $P(t) = k_{\\text{deg}}$ and $Q(t) = k_{\\text{PLC}} \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{D} + L_{0}}$ are both constants.\n\nThe solution can be found using an integrating factor, $\\mu(t)$, defined as:\n$$\\mu(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k_{\\text{deg}} \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t)$$\nMultiplying the differential equation by $\\mu(t)$:\n$$\\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t) \\frac{dI}{dt} + k_{\\text{deg}} \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t) I(t) = \\left(k_{\\text{PLC}} \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{D} + L_{0}}\\right) \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t)$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product $I(t)\\mu(t)$ by the product rule:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(I(t) \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t)\\right) = \\left(k_{\\text{PLC}} \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{D} + L_{0}}\\right) \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t)$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$I(t) \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t) = \\int \\left(k_{\\text{PLC}} \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{D} + L_{0}}\\right) \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t) \\, dt$$\n$$I(t) \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t) = \\left(k_{\\text{PLC}} \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{D} + L_{0}}\\right) \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{deg}}} \\exp(k_{\\text{deg}} t) + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.

The dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is given by the law of mass action:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{c [I]}{[I_{b}]}$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentrations of the indicator species as functions of $c$. Substituting $[I] = [I]_{T} - [I_{b}]$ into the equilibrium equation gives $K_{d} = c([I]_{T} - [I_{b}])/[I_{b}]$, which rearranges to $[I_{b}] = [I]_{T} \\frac{c}{c + K_{d}}$. Consequently, the fraction of unbound indicator is $[I] = [I]_{T} - [I_{b}] = [I]_{T} \\frac{K_{d}}{c + K_{d}}$.\n\nThe total measured fluorescence, $F(t)$, is a linear combination of the fluorescence from each species:\n$$F(t) = S_{f}[I] + S_{b}[I_{b}]$$\nwhere $S_{f}$ and $S_{b}$ are the molar fluorescence coefficients of the free and bound forms, respectively. The minimum fluorescence, $F_{\\min}$, occurs at $c=0$, where $[I]=[I]_T$ and $[I_b]=0$, so $F_{\\min} = S_{f}[I]_{T}$. The maximum fluorescence, $F_{\\max}$, occurs at saturating calcium concentration ($c \\to \\infty$), where $[I]=0$ and $[I_b]=[I]_T$, so $F_{\\max} = S_{b}[I]_{T}$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $[I]$, $[I_{b}]$, $S_{f}$, and $S_{b}$ into the equation for $F(t)$ yields:\n$$F(t) = \\frac{F_{\\min}}{[I]_{T}}\\left([I]_{T} \\frac{K_{d}}{c + K_{d}}\\right) + \\frac{F_{\\max}}{[I]_{T}}\\left([I]_{T} \\frac{c}{c + K_{d}}\\right) = \\frac{F_{\\min} K_{d} + F_{\\max} c}{c + K_{d}}$$\nTo find the calcium concentration $c(t)$ from the fluorescence $F(t)$, we must algebraically invert this equation:\n$$F(t)(c + K_{d}) = F_{\\min} K_{d} + F_{\\max} c$$\n$$c(F(t) - F_{\\max}) = F_{\\min} K_{d} - F(t) K_{d}$$\n$$c(t) = K_{d} \\frac{F_{\\min} - F(t)}{F(t) - F_{\\max}} = K_{d} \\frac{F(t) - F_{\\min}}{F_{\\max} - F(t)}$$\nThis is the Grynkiewicz equation. The problem requires this to be expressed in terms of the relative fluorescence change $\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t) = \\frac{F(t) - F_{0}}{F_{0}}$, the dynamic range $R_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{F_{\\min}}$, the baseline calcium $c_{0}$, and $K_{d}$.\nFrom the definition, $F(t) = F_{0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t)\\right)$. Substituting this into the equation for $c(t)$:\n$$c(t) = K_{d} \\frac{F_{0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t)\\right) - F_{\\min}}{F_{\\max} - F_{0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t)\\right)}$$\nTo eliminate the absolute fluorescence terms $F_{0}$, $F_{\\min}$, and $F_{\\max}$, we form ratios. We divide the numerator and denominator by $F_{\\min}$:\n$$c(t) = K_{d} \\frac{\\frac{F_{0}}{F_{\\min}} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t)\\right) - 1}{\\frac{F_{\\max}}{F_{\\min}} - \\frac{F_{0}}{F_{\\min}} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t)\\right)}$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{F_{0}}{F_{\\min}}$ can be found by evaluating the expression for $F(c)$ at the baseline condition $c=c_{0}$:\n$$F_{0} = \\frac{F_{\\min} K_{d} + F_{\\max} c_{0}}{c_{0} + K_{d}} \\implies \\frac{F_{0}}{F_{\\min}} = \\frac{K_{d} + \\frac{F_{\\max}}{F_{\\min}} c_{0}}{c_{0} + K_{d}} = \\frac{K_{d} + R_{\\mathrm{f}} c_{0}}{c_{0} + K_{d}}$$\nSubstituting this and $R_{\\mathrm{f}}$ into the equation for $c(t)$ gives the first required result, a general closed-form relationship:\n$$c(t) = K_{d} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{K_{d} + R_{\\mathrm{f}} c_{0}}{c_{0} + K_{d}}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t)\\right) - 1}{R_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\left(\\frac{K_{d} + R_{\\mathrm{f}} c_{0}}{c_{0} + K_{d}}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t)\\right)}$$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we apply this formula to the provided values: $K_{d} = 300\\,$nM, $R_{\\mathrm{f}} = 6$, $c_{0} = 80\\,$nM, and $\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t) = 1.5\\,\\exp(-t/2)$. Let us denote $y(t) = \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{0}}(t)$.\nFirst, we compute the constant ratio $\\frac{F_0}{F_{\\min}}$:\n$$\\frac{F_{0}}{F_{\\min}} = \\frac{300 + 6 \\cdot 80}{80 + 300} = \\frac{300 + 480}{380} = \\frac{780}{380} = \\frac{39}{19}$$\nSubstituting this into the simplified expression for $c(t)$:\n$$c(t) = K_{d} \\frac{\\frac{F_{0}}{F_{\\min}}(1+y(t)) - 1}{R_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\frac{F_{0}}{F_{\\min}}(1+y(t))} = 300 \\frac{\\frac{39}{19}(1+y(t)) - 1}{6 - \\frac{39}{19}(1+y(t))}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator of the main fraction by $19$:\n$$c(t) = 300 \\frac{39(1+y(t)) - 19}{19 \\cdot 6 - 39(1+y(t))} = 300 \\frac{39+39y(t) - 19}{114 - 39 - 39y(t)} = 300 \\frac{20 + 39y(t)}{75 - 39y(t)}$$\nNow, substitute the given function $y(t) = 1.5\\,\\exp(-t/2) = \\frac{3}{2}\\exp(-t/2)$:\n$$c(t) = 300 \\frac{20 + 39\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\exp(-t/2)\\right)}{75 - 39\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\exp(-t/2)\\right)} = 300 \\frac{20 + \\frac{117}{2}\\exp(-t/2)}{75 - \\frac{117}{2}\\exp(-t/2)}$$\nTo clear the fractions of $2$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $2$:\n$$c(t) = 300 \\frac{40 + 117\\exp(-t/2)}{150 - 117\\exp(-t/2)}$$\nThe coefficients in the denominator, $150$ and $117$, share a common factor of $3$. Factoring this out gives the final simplified expression:\n$$c(t) = 300 \\frac{40 + 117\\exp(-t/2)}{3(50 - 39\\exp(-t/2))} = 100 \\frac{40 + 117\\exp(-t/2)}{50 - 39\\exp(-t/2)}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for $c(t)$ in units of nM.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{100 \\frac{40 + 117 \\exp(-t/2)}{50 - 39 \\exp(-t/2)}}\n$$", "id": "2714423"}]}
