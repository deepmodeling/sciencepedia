We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $N_i(t)$ be the amount of neuroligin (NLGN) in the intracellular pool and $N_s(t)$ be the amount on the cell surface at time $t$. The dynamics of this $2$-compartment system are described by a system of ordinary differential equations based on the stated assumptions.\n\nThe rate of change for the intracellular pool, $\\frac{dN_i}{dt}$, is the rate of synthesis minus the rate of exocytosis. Synthesis occurs at a constant rate $k_s$. Exocytosis is a first-order process dependent on the intracellular amount, with rate $k_{exo} N_i(t)$.

The construct retains the native signal peptide, a single-pass transmembrane segment, and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of neuroligin-2.

Its ectodomain, derived from NLGN1, will face the synaptic cleft, while its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, derived from NLGN2, will span the membrane and extend into the neuron's cytoplasm.\n\n2.  **Trans-synaptic Adhesion**: According to the \"Cell Adhesion Logic\", the extracellular domain determines the binding to presynaptic partners. The chimera possesses the NLGN1 ectodomain. This domain binds to presynaptic neurexins, which are present on both glutamatergic and GABAergic axon terminals. Therefore, the chimeric protein will be capable of forming adhesive contacts with both types of presynaptic terminals available in the culture, initiating the first step of synaptogenesis at these locations.\n\n3.  **Postsynaptic Scaffolding**: According to the \"Scaffold Recruitment Logic\", the intracellular cytoplasmic tail determines the identity of the postsynaptic specialization. The chimera possesses the NLGN2 cytoplasmic tail. This principle explicitly states that the NLGN2 tail \"preferentially couples to inhibitory scaffolds such as gephyrin ... to assemble GABAergic postsynaptic specializations\". Consequently, wherever the chimera forms an adhesive contact, its NLGN2 tail will recruit the inhibitory scaffolding machinery. It will not recruit the excitatory scaffold PSD-95.\n\n4.  **Predicted Outcome**: The chimera acts as a molecular device where the extracellular part (NLGN1 ectodomain) establishes a physical link with presynaptic terminals, and the intracellular part (NLGN2 tail) instructs the assembly of an inhibitory postsynaptic density. This will lead to the selective formation and/or stabilization of inhibitory synapses.
