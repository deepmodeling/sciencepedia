The problem specifies a model based on mass-action kinetics.\n\nThe rate of association, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is the number of tubulin dimers added to the microtubule end per unit time. This is a second-order reaction, as it depends on both the presence of the microtubule end and the concentration of free tubulin dimers, $[T]$. According to the law of mass action, this rate is given by:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{on}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} [T]\n$$\nHere, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the second-order association rate constant. The units of $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ are $(\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, representing events per second.\n\nThe rate of dissociation, $R_{\\mathrm{off}}$, is the number of tubulin dimers lost from the microtubule end per unit time. This is a first-order process, as it depends only on the state of the end itself. The rate is given by the first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}\n$$\nThe units of $R_{\\mathrm{off}}$ are $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, also representing events per second.\n\nThe net rate of subunit addition, which we will denote as $J$, is the difference between the association and dissociation rates:\n$$\nJ = R_{\\mathrm{on}} - R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} [T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}\n$$\nA positive value of $J$ signifies net polymerization (growth), while a negative value signifies net depolymerization (shrinkage). The condition for growth is $J > 0$, which is equivalent to $k_{\\mathrm{on}} [T] > k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n\nThe net growth velocity, $v_{+}$, is the net rate of subunit addition, $J$, multiplied by the increment in length, $d$, for each subunit added. Therefore, the expression for the net plus-end growth velocity is:\n$$\nv_{+} = J \\cdot d = (k_{\\mathrm{on}} [T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}) d\n$$\nThis is the required expression derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we will evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values. First, we determine if growth is expected under these conditions by comparing the association and dissociation rates.\n- Association rate: $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} [T] = (4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Dissociation rate: $R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSince $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} > R_{\\mathrm{off}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the rate of subunit addition exceeds the rate of subunit loss. Therefore, **growth is expected under these conditions**.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the growth velocity, $v_{+}$.\n$$\nv_{+} = (20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (8\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = (10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (8\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = 80\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{nm}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of micrometers per minute ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{min}$). We perform the unit conversion:\n$$\nv_{+} = 80\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{nm}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{nm}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{min}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nv_{+} = \\frac{80 \\times 60}{1000}\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{4800}{1000}\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{min}} = 4.8\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{min}}\n$$\nFinally, rounding the result to three significant figures as specified gives:\n$$\nv_{+} = 4.80\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{min}}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.80}$$", "id": "2726111"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic model of polymer growth, a crucial concept emerges when we ask: at what tubulin concentration does net growth cease?

Let $[T]$ denote the concentration of free, assembly-competent tubulin in solution.

A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the stall concentration $[T]_{s}$, where the net growth velocity $v_{+}$ is zero.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of association of tubulin subunits to the microtubule end, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is a bimolecular process. It is proportional to the concentration of free tubulin, $[T]$, and the number of available binding sites. For a single protofilament end, the rate of association events (in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) is given by:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{on}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} [T]$$\nThe rate of dissociation, $R_{\\mathrm{off}}$, is given as a first-order process, meaning it depends only on the presence of a terminal subunit and is independent of the free tubulin concentration. The rate of dissociation events is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\nThe net rate of subunit incorporation, $J$, is the difference between the association and dissociation rates:\n$$J = R_{\\mathrm{on}} - R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\nThe mean growth velocity, $v_{+}$, is defined as the product of the length increment per subunit, $\\delta$, and the net incorporation rate, $J$.\n$$v_{+} = \\delta \\cdot J = \\delta (k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}})$$\nGrowth is stalled when $v_{+} = 0$. The tubulin concentration at which this occurs is denoted $[T]_{s}$. We set the expression for $v_{+}$ to zero:\n$$0 = \\delta (k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T]_{s} - k_{\\mathrm{off}})$$\nGiven that the length increment $\\delta$ is a non-zero physical constant, the term in parentheses must be equal to zero for the equation to hold:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T]_{s} - k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 0$$\nSolving for $[T]_{s}$ yields the analytical expression for the stall concentration:\n$$[T]_{s} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nNow, we evaluate $[T]_{s}$ numerically using the provided values: $k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 3\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$[T]_{s} = \\frac{6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{3\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $2$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $2$, which can be written as $2.0$ to indicate two significant figures. The units are $\\mu \\mathrm{M}$, as required.\n\n**Physical Interpretation of $[T]_{s}$**\nThe concentration $[T]_{s}$ represents the **critical concentration** for polymerization at the microtubule plus end. At this specific concentration of free tubulin, the rate of subunit addition ($R_{\\mathrm{on}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T]_{s}$) is precisely balanced by the rate of subunit loss ($R_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}$). Consequently, there is no net change in the length of the microtubule, and the mean growth velocity is zero.\n\nIf the ambient tubulin concentration $[T]$ is greater than $[T]_{s}$, the rate of association will exceed the rate of dissociation ($R_{\\mathrm{on}} > R_{\\mathrm{off}}$), resulting in net polymerization ($v_{+} > 0$). Conversely, if $[T]$ is less than $[T]_{s}$, the rate of dissociation will be greater than the rate of association ($R_{\\mathrm{off}} > R_{\\mathrm{on}}$), leading to net depolymerization ($v_{+} < 0$).\n\nThe expression $[T]_{s} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ quantitatively demonstrates how this critical concentration is determined by the intrinsic kinetics of the system. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) function by modulating these rate constants. For example, a stabilizing MAP (e.g., Tau, MAP2) would typically decrease the dissociation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, thereby lowering the critical concentration $[T]_{s}$ and promoting microtubule assembly or stability at lower tubulin concentrations. Conversely, a destabilizing protein (e.g., a kinesin from the Kinesin-13 family) might increase $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, raising $[T]_{s}$ and favoring disassembly. Therefore, $[T]_{s}$ is not a fixed universal constant but rather a dynamic parameter reflecting the specific cellular environment, including the local activities of various MAPs that influence the fundamental on- and off-rates at the microtubule end.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.0}$$", "id": "2726118"}, {"introduction": "In a living cell, microtubule dynamics are not governed by tubulin alone; they are actively tuned by a host of Microtubule-Associated Proteins (MAPs).

This is based on the stated assumption of independent processes.\n$$v = v_{0} + v_{X}$$\nThe velocity contribution from XMAP215, $v_X$, is determined by the rate at which XMAP215 adds tubulin dimers. This rate is the product of the intrinsic catalytic turnover rate of a single bound XMAP215 molecule, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ (in units of turnovers per second, or dimers per second), the probability that the single binding site at the plus-end is occupied by an XMAP215 molecule, $P_{\\mathrm{occ}}$, and the length added per catalytic event, $d$.\n$$v_{X} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{occ}} \\cdot d$$\nThe problem specifies that the binding and unbinding of XMAP215 is fast, justifying a quasi-steady-state assumption for the occupancy of the single binding site.
