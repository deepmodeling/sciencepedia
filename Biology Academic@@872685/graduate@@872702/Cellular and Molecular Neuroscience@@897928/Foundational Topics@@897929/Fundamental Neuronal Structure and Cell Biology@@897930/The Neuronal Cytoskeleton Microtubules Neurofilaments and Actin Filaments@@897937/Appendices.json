The problem is therefore deemed valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the new growth velocity under nocodazole treatment and the time for complete depolymerization after a catastrophe.\n\nFirst, we determine the new plus-end growth velocity, $v_g$. The velocity of the microtubule tip is the net rate of length change, which is the difference between the rate of addition and the rate of loss of tubulin dimers, multiplied by the length change per dimer, $\\delta$. The rate of addition is given by the product of the association rate constant $k_{\\text{on}}^{+}$ and the free tubulin concentration $C$. The rate of loss from a growing tip is given by the dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}^{+}$. The growth velocity is thus expressed as:\n$$v_g = ( (k_{\\text{on}}^{+} \\times C) - k_{\\text{off}}^{+} ) \\times \\delta$$\nThe problem specifies the following baseline parameters: $k_{\\text{on}}^{+} = 1.5\\,\\mu\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, baseline $k_{\\text{off}}^{+} = 3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $C = 10\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, and $\\delta = 8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\nThe nocodazole treatment doubles the plus-end dissociation rate at a growing tip. Therefore, the new dissociation rate, which we denote as $k_{\\text{off, new}}^{+}$, is:\n$$k_{\\text{off, new}}^{+} = 2 \\times (\\text{baseline } k_{\\text{off}}^{+}) = 2 \\times 3\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 6\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe association rate constant and concentration remain unchanged. We now calculate the new growth velocity, $v_g$, using the modified dissociation rate:\n$$v_g = ( (1.5\\,\\mu\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\times 10\\,\\mu\\text{M}) - 6\\,\\text{s}^{-1} ) \\times 8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\nFirst, compute the net rate of dimer addition in units of $\\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$(15\\,\\text{s}^{-1} - 6\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 9\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nNow, multiply by the step size $\\delta$ to obtain the velocity in $\\mu\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$v_g = 9\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\times 8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.072\\,\\mu\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the growth velocity is $0.0720\\,\\mu\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the time, $t$, required to completely depolymerize a microtubule of length $L = 10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ after a catastrophe.

It is scientifically grounded, employing a standard model of microtubule dynamic instability from cellular biophysics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($f_c$ and $f_r$) to uniquely determine the stationary probabilities of the two-state system. The language is objective and precise. The numerical values are physically realistic for microtubules. The inclusion of velocities $v_g$ and $v_s$ does not invalidate the problem; they are simply not required for the specific question of determining the time fractions, which depend only on the transition rates. The problem requires a standard derivation from first principles, which is a legitimate and non-trivial task.\n\nThe solution proceeds.\n\nLet the two states of the system be denoted by $G$ (growth) and $S$ (shrinkage). Let $p_g(t)$ and $p_s(t)$ be the probabilities of finding the microtubule end in state $G$ and state $S$ at time $t$, respectively.

The system is closed, so the total probability is conserved: $p_g(t) + p_s(t) = 1$ for all $t$. Taking the a derivative with respect to time gives $\\frac{d}{dt}(p_g(t) + p_s(t)) = \\frac{dp_g(t)}{dt} + \\frac{dp_s(t)}{dt} = (p_s(t) f_r - p_g(t) f_c) + (p_g(t) f_c - p_s(t) f_r) = 0$, which is consistent.\n\nThe problem states that the process is ergodic and reaches a stationary regime. In this steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their time derivatives are zero. Let $p_g$ and $p_s$ be the stationary probabilities.\n$$\n\\frac{dp_g}{dt} = 0 \\implies p_s f_r - p_g f_c = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp_s}{dt} = 0 \\implies p_g f_c - p_s f_r = 0\n$$\nBoth equations are identical and yield the condition of detailed balance:\n$$\np_g f_c = p_s f_r\n$$\nThis equation signifies that in the steady state, the total probability flux from the growth state to the shrinkage state is exactly balanced by the total probability flux from the shrinkage state to the growth state.\n\nTo solve for the individual probabilities $p_g$ and $p_s$, we use this detailed balance equation in conjunction with the normalization condition:\n$$\np_g + p_s = 1\n$$\nFrom the normalization condition, we express one probability in terms of the other, for instance, $p_s = 1 - p_g$. Substituting this into the detailed balance equation:\n$$\np_g f_c = (1 - p_g) f_r\n$$\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n$$\np_g f_c = f_r - p_g f_r\n$$\nCollecting terms containing $p_g$:\n$$\np_g f_c + p_g f_r = f_r\n$$\n$$\np_g (f_c + f_r) = f_r\n$$\nSolving for $p_g$:\n$$\np_g = \\frac{f_r}{f_c + f_r}\n$$\nNow, we find $p_s$ using $p_s = 1 - p_g$:\n$$\np_s = 1 - \\frac{f_r}{f_c + f_r} = \\frac{(f_c + f_r) - f_r}{f_c + f_r} = \\frac{f_c}{f_c + f_r}\n$$\nThese are the steady-state probabilities for the growth and shrinkage states, respectively. As stated in the problem, these probabilities are equal to the fraction of time the microtubule end spends in each state. It is important to note that these fractions depend only on the catastrophe and rescue frequencies, $f_c$ and $f_r$, and not on the velocities $v_g$ and $v_s$.\n\nNow we evaluate these expressions using the given numerical values: $f_c = 0.02\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $f_r = 0.01\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThe sum of the frequencies is $f_c + f_r = 0.02\\,\\text{s}^{-1} + 0.01\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.03\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe steady-state time fraction in the growth state is:\n$$\np_g = \\frac{0.01\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{0.03\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe steady-state time fraction in the shrinkage state is:\n$$\np_s = \\frac{0.02\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{0.03\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe sum $p_g + p_s = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = 1$, confirming the correctness of the calculation.\n\nThe final result is to be expressed as a row matrix $(p_g\\; p_s)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2765307"}, {"introduction": "This final practice shifts the focus from the dynamics of a single polymer to the collective transport of cytoskeletal cargo along the axon.
