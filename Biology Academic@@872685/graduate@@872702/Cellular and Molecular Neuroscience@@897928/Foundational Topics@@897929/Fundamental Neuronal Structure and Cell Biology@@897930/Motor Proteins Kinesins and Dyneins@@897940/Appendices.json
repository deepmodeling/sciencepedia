A polystyrene bead with refractive index greater than the surrounding aqueous medium is attached to a single motor protein that walks on a microtubule immobilized on a glass coverslip. A high numerical aperture objective is used for trapping and for forming the evanescent field. Bead position is reported as a voltage from a Quadrant Photodiode (QPD), and you must report motor-generated force as a function of displacement, while simultaneously imaging with TIRF to localize the motor near the surface and reduce background.\n\nWhich option correctly states the physical principles that enable optical trapping and TIRF in this context and outlines a scientifically sound calibration workflow to convert the QPD voltage signal to force on the bead?\n\nA. Optical trapping works because radiation pressure from scattering pushes the bead into the intensity maximum; trap stiffness depends primarily on bead charge.

TIRF relies on total internal reflection, and the evanescent field intensity increases with distance from the interface, allowing deeper structures to be illuminated more strongly.", "solution": "**Derivation of Principles and Calibration**\n\nFirst, we analyze the physical principles of the two techniques.\n\n**Optical Trapping**:\nAn optical trap uses a tightly focused laser beam to exert forces on a microscopic dielectric particle. For a particle with refractive index $n_{p}$ suspended in a medium of refractive index $n_{m}$, where $n_{p} > n_{m}$ (as stated in the problem), two forces are relevant:\n1.  **Scattering Force**: This arises from the momentum of photons being transferred to the particle upon reflection and refraction. It pushes the particle along the direction of beam propagation.\n2.  **Gradient Force**: The intense, non-uniform electric field of the focused beam induces a dipole in the dielectric particle. This dipole is then pulled towards the region of highest field intensity. For a high-NA objective creating a steep intensity gradient, this force is directed towards the focal point.\nA stable three-dimensional trap is achieved when the axial gradient force is strong enough to overcome the scattering force. Near the center of the trap, the restoring force on the bead is, to a good approximation, linear with displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position. This is described by Hooke's Law:\n$$F_{trap} = -\\kappa x$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the trap stiffness. The trap thus creates an approximately harmonic potential well $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa x^2$.\n\n**Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy**:\nTIRF is a technique used to selectively excite fluorophores in a thin region near a surface. It is based on the phenomenon of total internal reflection, which occurs when light propagates from a medium of higher refractive index ($n_1$, e.g., the glass coverslip) to a medium of lower refractive index ($n_2$, e.g., the aqueous buffer). According to Snell's Law, $n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)$, where $\\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence and $\\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction.\nIf $\\theta_1$ exceeds a critical angle, $\\theta_c$, given by:\n$$\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)$$\nthe light is totally internally reflected at the interface. However, an electromagnetic field, called the **evanescent wave**, penetrates a short distance into the lower-index medium. The intensity $I$ of this field decays exponentially with perpendicular distance $z$ from the interface:\n$$I(z) = I_0 e^{-z/d}$$\nThe characteristic penetration depth, $d$, is typically on the order of $50-100$ nm. This selective, near-surface illumination dramatically reduces background fluorescence from molecules in the bulk solution, providing a very high signal-to-noise ratio for events occurring at or near the surface, such as a motor protein walking on an immobilized track.\n\n**Calibration Workflow (QPD Voltage to Force)**\nTo convert the raw voltage signal from the QPD into a force measurement in piconewtons ($pN$), a two-step calibration is required.\n1.  **Displacement Calibration**: The QPD output voltage, $V$, must be related to the bead's physical displacement, $x$. This is achieved by determining the detector sensitivity, $\\beta$ (in units of $V/m$). A standard method is to hold a bead in the trap and move the entire sample stage with a calibrated piezo-actuator over a known distance, sweeping the static bead through the laser beam. The slope of the linear portion of the recorded $V$ vs. position curve gives $\\beta$. Thus, displacement is $x = V/\\beta$.\n2.  **Stiffness Calibration**: The trap stiffness, $\\kappa$ (in units of $N/m$), must be determined. This allows conversion from displacement to force via $F = \\kappa x$. Several standard methods exist:\n    *   **Power Spectrum Analysis**: The Brownian motion of the trapped bead is recorded as a time series of its position. The power spectral density (PSD) of this motion is computed. For a particle in a harmonic potential, the PSD has a characteristic Lorentzian shape. The corner frequency $f_c$ of this Lorentzian is related to the stiffness $\\kappa$ and the hydrodynamic drag coefficient $\\gamma$ by $f_c = \\kappa / (2\\pi\\gamma)$. The drag coefficient $\\gamma$ for a sphere of radius $r$ in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta$ is given by the Stokes formula, $\\gamma = 6\\pi\\eta r$, but this must be corrected for proximity to the surface. By fitting the experimental PSD to the theoretical Lorentzian, $\\kappa$ can be accurately determined.\n    *   **Equipartition Method**: The equipartition theorem states that for a system in thermal equilibrium, each quadratic degree of freedom has an average energy of $\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For a bead in a 1D harmonic trap, $\\langle U \\rangle = \\langle \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T$. By measuring the variance of the bead's position, $\\sigma_x^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, the stiffness is calculated as $\\kappa = k_B T / \\sigma_x^2$.\n    *   **Stokes' Drag Method**: A known external force is applied, and the resulting bead displacement is measured. The force is typically a viscous drag force, $F_{drag} = \\gamma v$, created by moving the fluid with a known velocity $v$. At steady state, the trap force balances the drag force, so $\\kappa x = \\gamma v$. Thus, $\\kappa = (\\gamma v) / x$.\nAs the experiment is performed near a surface, it is critical that any calibration method that relies on the drag coefficient $\\gamma$ (i.e., power spectrum and Stokes' drag methods) incorporates the well-known hydrodynamic corrections for an object moving near a wall.\n\nWith both $\\beta$ and $\\kappa$ determined, the force is calculated from the QPD voltage as $F = \\kappa x = \\kappa (V/\\beta)$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Optical trapping works because radiation pressure from scattering pushes the bead into the intensity maximum; trap stiffness depends primarily on bead charge.

Trap stiffness depends on laser power and refractive index mismatch, not primarily bead charge. The proposed calibration method is nonsensical and unphysical.

Optical trapping reads out force directly from laser power because the momentum flux uniquely determines force without any additional information. No calibration is required if laser power is known. TIRF operates by driving fluorophores into saturation so that only those bound to the surface remain fluorescent.**\n    - This is incorrect. Force is the product of stiffness and displacement, $F = \\kappa x$. Laser power sets $\\kappa$, but displacement $x$ must be measured. Claiming that no calibration is required is a grave misunderstanding of quantitative force spectroscopy. The description of TIRF is also wrong; it confuses the principle of TIRF (selective excitation) with phenomena like photobleaching or principles behind certain super-resolution techniques.\n    - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D.

The primary trapping mechanism for dielectric beads is the gradient force, not photothermal effects (photophoresis). The description of calibration is vague and imprecise. The description of TIRF is completely incorrect; it describes the working principle of a **confocal microscope**, which uses a pinhole to reject out-of-focus light, not TIRF, which uses an evanescent wave.\n    - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E.
