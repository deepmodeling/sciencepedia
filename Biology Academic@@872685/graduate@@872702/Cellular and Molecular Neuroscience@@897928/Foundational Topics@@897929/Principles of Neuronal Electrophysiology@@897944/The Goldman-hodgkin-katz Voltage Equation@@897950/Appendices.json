It is a standard, well-posed problem in biophysics, grounded in established physical chemistry principles (the Nernst-Planck equation). All necessary data are provided, and the values are physiologically realistic. The problem is self-contained, objective, and requires rigorous derivation and calculation, which is appropriate for scientific inquiry.\n\nWe will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the Nernst–Planck equation for the flux of an ionic species $i$ across a one-dimensional membrane:\n$$\nJ_{i}(x) = -D_{i}\\left(\\frac{d C_{i}}{dx} + \\frac{z_{i} F}{R T}\\,C_{i}\\,\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $J_{i}$ is the flux (moles per unit area per unit time), $D_{i}$ is the diffusion coefficient, $C_{i}(x)$ is the concentration at position $x$ within the membrane, $z_{i}$ is the ionic valence, $F$ is Faraday's constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\phi(x)$ is the electric potential. The spatial coordinate $x$ ranges from $x=0$ (outside) to $x=d$ (inside).\n\nThe constant-field approximation assumes the electric field $E = -d\\phi/dx$ is uniform across the membrane. Thus, $d\\phi/dx = (\\phi(d) - \\phi(0))/d = (V_{\\text{inside}} - V_{\\text{outside}})/d = V_{m}/d$.\nSubstituting this into the Nernst-Planck equation:\n$$\nJ_{i} = -D_{i}\\left(\\frac{d C_{i}}{dx} + \\frac{z_{i} F V_{m}}{R T d}\\,C_{i}\\right)\n$$\nAt steady state, the flux $J_{i}$ must be constant with respect to $x$. We can rearrange this into a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $C_{i}(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d C_{i}}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{z_{i} F V_{m}}{R T d}\\right) C_{i} = -\\frac{J_{i}}{D_{i}}\n$$\nThis equation is solved by integrating across the membrane from $x=0$ to $x=d$, with boundary conditions $C_{i}(0) = [C_{i}]_{o}$ and $C_{i}(d) = [C_{i}]_{i}$. The solution for the steady-state flux $J_i$ is found to be:\n$$\nJ_i = - \\frac{P_i z_i F V_m}{RT} \\frac{[C_i]_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_i F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [C_i]_o}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{z_i F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1}\n$$\nwhere the permeability $P_i$ is defined as $P_i = D_i/d$.\n\nThe reversal potential, $V_{\\text{rev}}$, is the membrane potential $V_m$ at which the total electric current density, $I_{\\text{total}}$, is zero. The current density carried by ion $i$ is $I_i = z_i F J_i$. The zero-net-current condition is:\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i} I_i = \\sum_{i} z_i F J_i = 0\n$$\nSince $F \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $\\sum_{i} z_i J_i = 0$. For the given system with $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$:\n$$\nz_{\\text{Na}} J_{\\text{Na}} + z_{\\text{Cl}} J_{\\text{Cl}} = 0\n$$\nThe total current density is:\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}} = -P_{\\text{Na}} \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\text{Na}]_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [\\text{Na}]_o}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1} - P_{\\text{Cl}} \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\text{Cl}]_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [\\text{Cl}]_o}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1} = 0\n$$\nwhere we have substituted $z_{\\text{Na}}=+1$ and $z_{\\text{Cl}}=-1$, and noted that $z_i^2 = 1$ for both ions. For $V_m \\neq 0$, we can cancel the common factor $-\\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT}$.\n\nA critical step is to handle the term for the anion, $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. We manipulate its term to create a common denominator with the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ term. Let $u = \\frac{F V_m}{RT}$. The $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ term is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{Cl}} \\frac{[\\text{Cl}]_i \\exp(-u) - [\\text{Cl}]_o}{\\exp(-u) - 1} = P_{\\text{Cl}} \\frac{[\\text{Cl}]_i \\exp(-u) - [\\text{Cl}]_o}{-\\exp(-u)(\\exp(u) - 1)} = P_{\\text{Cl}} \\frac{[\\text{Cl}]_o \\exp(u) - [\\text{Cl}]_i}{\\exp(u) - 1}\n$$\nThis manipulation explicitly shows the consequence of the negative valence $z_{\\text{Cl}}=-1$. It effectively swaps the roles of the intracellular and extracellular concentrations in the numerator, compared to a cation.\n\nSetting the sum of the numerators to zero at $V_m = V_{\\text{rev}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{Na}} \\left([\\text{Na}]_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_{\\text{rev}}}{RT}\\right) - [\\text{Na}]_o\\right) + P_{\\text{Cl}} \\left([\\text{Cl}]_o \\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_{\\text{rev}}}{RT}\\right) - [\\text{Cl}]_i\\right) = 0\n$$\nWe group terms containing $\\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_{\\text{rev}}}{RT}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{F V_{\\text{rev}}}{RT}\\right) (P_{\\text{Na}}[\\text{Na}]_i + P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}]_o) = P_{\\text{Na}}[\\text{Na}]_o + P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}]_i\n$$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{rev}}$ gives the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation for this system:\n$$\nV_{\\text{rev}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o} + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{i}}{P_{\\text{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i} + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{o}} \\right)\n$$\nAs justified in the derivation, the negative valence of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ results in its intracellular concentration $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{i}$ appearing in the numerator of the logarithm's argument and its extracellular concentration $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{o}$ in the denominator, which is the inverse of the arrangement for the cation $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically. First, we calculate the prefactor $\\frac{RT}{F}$:\n$$\n\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.0267134\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the argument of the logarithm, using the given permeabilities and concentrations. The concentration units (mM) cancel out.\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\text{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o} + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{i}}{P_{\\text{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i} + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{o}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 145) + (0.20 \\times 10)}{(1.0 \\times 15) + (0.20 \\times 120)} = \\frac{145 + 2}{15 + 24} = \\frac{147}{39} = \\frac{49}{13}\n$$\nNow, we calculate $V_{\\text{rev}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{rev}} = (0.0267134\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{49}{13}\\right) \\approx (0.0267134\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times 1.32680 \\approx 0.035445\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nConverting to millivolts and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\nV_{\\text{rev}} \\approx 35.45\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the sign of the net current at $V_{m} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. At $V_m = 0$, the electrical driving force vanishes, and the flux is purely diffusive. The GHK current equation is indeterminate ($0/0$) at $V_m=0$ and requires using L'Hôpital's rule. The limit of the GHK flux equation as $V_m \\to 0$ gives $J_i(0) = P_i ([C_i]_o - [C_i]_i)$.\nHere, a positive flux corresponds to an influx.\nFor $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{Na}}(0) = P_{\\text{Na}} ([\\text{Na}]_o - [\\text{Na}]_i) = 1.0 \\times (145 - 15) = 130 \\text{ (in proportional units)}\n$$\nSince $J_{\\text{Na}}(0) > 0$, the sodium flux is inward.\nFor $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{Cl}}(0) = P_{\\text{Cl}} ([\\text{Cl}]_o - [\\text{Cl}]_i) = 0.20 \\times (120 - 10) = 22 \\text{ (in proportional units)}\n$$\nSince $J_{\\text{Cl}}(0) > 0$, the chloride flux is also inward.\n\nThe net current is $I_{\\text{net}} = I_{\\text{Na}} + I_{\\text{Cl}} = z_{\\text{Na}} F J_{\\text{Na}} + z_{\\text{Cl}} F J_{\\text{Cl}}$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{net}}(0) = (+1)F(J_{\\text{Na}}) + (-1)F(J_{\\text{Cl}}) = F(130 - 22) = 108F\n$$\nSince $F > 0$, the net current $I_{\\text{net}}(0)$ has a positive sign. This corresponds to a net inward flow of positive charge (or a net outward flow of negative charge).\n\nThe negative valence of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ is critical. For both $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the concentration is higher outside, so diffusion drives both species into the cell (influx). The influx of positive $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions contributes an inward current component. The influx of negative $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ ions is equivalent to an outward current of positive charge. Thus, the $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ current opposes the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current. The negative valence $z_{\\text{Cl}} = -1$ flips the sign of the current contribution from the chloride flux relative to the sodium flux. The net current is the sum of a large inward $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ component and a smaller outward $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ component, resulting in a net inward current of positive charge (positive sign in our physical derivation).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{35.45}\n$$", "id": "2763559"}, {"introduction": "While the standard GHK voltage equation provides an elegant logarithmic solution, it is only applicable when all permeant ions share the same absolute valence.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of parameters for a non-trivial problem in electrophysiology. It requires the derivation and application of fundamental principles, specifically the Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion model under the constant-field assumption.\n\nWe begin by deriving the current-voltage relationship for a single ionic species, which is the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation. The starting point is the Nernst-Planck equation, which describes the flux $J_i(x)$ of an ionic species $i$ at position $x$ across the membrane:\n$$J_i(x) = -D_i \\left( \\frac{dC_i(x)}{dx} + \\frac{z_i F}{RT} C_i(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} \\right)$$\nHere, $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient, $C_i(x)$ is the concentration, $z_i$ is the valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\phi(x)$ is the electric potential.\n\nWe impose two key assumptions:\n1.  **Steady State**: The system is in a steady state, meaning the flux $J_i$ is constant for all $x$ within the membrane, i.e., $dJ_i/dx = 0$.\n2.  **Constant Field**: The electric field $E = -d\\phi/dx$ is constant across the membrane thickness $L$. If the potential difference across the membrane is $V_m = \\phi_{in} - \\phi_{out}$, then $E = -V_m/L$. Consequently, $d\\phi/dx = V_m/L$.\n\nSubstituting the constant field assumption into the Nernst-Planck equation yields a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $C_i(x)$:\n$$\\frac{dC_i}{dx} + \\frac{z_i F V_m}{RT L} C_i(x) = -\\frac{J_i}{D_i}$$\nThis equation is solved subject to the boundary conditions at the outer ($x=0$) and inner ($x=L$) surfaces of the membrane: $C_i(0) = [i]_o$ and $C_i(L) = [i]_i$. The solution for the constant flux $J_i$ is:\n$$J_i = P_i \\frac{z_i F V_m}{RT} \\frac{[i]_i - [i]_o e^{-z_i F V_m / (RT)}}{1 - e^{-z_i F V_m / (RT)}}$$\nwhere the permeability $P_i$ is defined as $D_i/L$. The ionic current density $j_i$ is then $z_i F J_i$. The total current for a membrane area $A$ is $I_i = j_i A$. Customarily, permeability $P_i$ is defined to absorb geometric factors such that the current $I_i$ is written as:\n$$I_i(V_m) = P_i \\frac{z_i^2 F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[i]_i - [i]_o e^{-z_i F V_m / (RT)}}{1 - e^{-z_i F V_m / (RT)}}$$\nThis is the GHK current equation. A positive current corresponds to a net outward flow of positive charge.\n\nThe reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the membrane potential $V_m$ at which the total current across the membrane is zero. For the given system permeable to sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}^+$) and calcium ($\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$), this condition is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{total}}(E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) = I_{\\mathrm{Na}}(E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) + I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) = 0$$\nFor a non-zero reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\ne 0$), the common factor $F^2 E_{\\mathrm{rev}} / RT$ can be divided out, yielding:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{Na}} z_{\\mathrm{Na}}^2 \\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}]_i - [\\mathrm{Na}]_o e^{-z_{\\mathrm{Na}} u}}{1 - e^{-z_{\\mathrm{Na}} u}} + P_{\\mathrm{Ca}} z_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^2 \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_o e^{-z_{\\mathrm{Ca}} u}}{1 - e^{-z_{\\mathrm{Ca}} u}} = 0$$\nwhere $u = F E_{\\mathrm{rev}} / (RT)$. Substituting the given valences $z_{\\mathrm{Na}}=+1$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Ca}}=+2$, and dividing by $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ (which is non-zero), we obtain an equation in terms of the permeability ratio $r = P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$:\n$$(1)^2 \\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}]_i - [\\mathrm{Na}]_o e^{-u}}{1 - e^{-u}} + r (2)^2 \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_o e^{-2u}}{1 - e^{-2u}} = 0$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for the unknown $u$, and thus for $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. Although the problem requires a numerical root-finding algorithm, it must be noted that this specific equation, due to the valences being $1$ and $2$, can be algebraically simplified. By letting $y = e^{-u}$ and using the identity $1-e^{-2u} = 1-y^2 = (1-y)(1+y)$, the equation transforms into a quadratic equation for $y$:\n$$([\\mathrm{Na}]_o + 4r[\\mathrm{Ca}]_o) y^2 + ([\\mathrm{Na}]_o - [\\mathrm{Na}]_i) y - ([\\mathrm{Na}]_i + 4r[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i) = 0$$\nSolving this provides an analytical solution for $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -\\frac{RT}{F}\\ln(y)$. This is the more elegant and direct method. However, to adhere to the problem's explicit instruction, we will proceed with a numerical root-finding approach. The analytical solution serves as an excellent means of verification.\n\nTo implement the numerical solution, we define a function $f(V_m, r)$ representing the sum of the GHK flux terms, whose root we seek:\n$$f(V_m, r) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}]_i - [\\mathrm{Na}]_o e^{-z_{\\mathrm{Na}} V_m F / RT}}{1 - e^{-z_{\\mathrm{Na}} V_m F / RT}} + 4r \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_o e^{-z_{\\mathrm{Ca}} V_m F / RT}}{1 - e^{-z_{\\mathrm{Ca}} V_m F / RT}}$$\nThe parameters are given as:\n$T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$F = 96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$z_{\\mathrm{Na}} = +1$, $z_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = +2$\n$[\\mathrm{Na}]_o = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Na}]_i = 12\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n$[\\mathrm{Ca}]_o = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.0001\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n\nA robust numerical search requires bracketing the root.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The language is precise and quantitative. The given values are physiologically realistic. The problem is valid.\n\n**Derivation of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) Voltage Equation**\nThe steady-state flux density $j_s$ of an ionic species $s$ across a membrane is described by the Nernst-Planck equation:\n$$\nj_s = -D_s \\left( \\frac{dC_s}{dx} + \\frac{z_s F}{RT} C_s \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $D_s$ is the diffusion coefficient of the ion in the membrane, $C_s(x)$ is its concentration at position $x$ within the membrane, $z_s$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\phi(x)$ is the electric potential.\n\nThe constant-field assumption states that the electric field $E = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$ is constant across the membrane of thickness $L$. Thus, $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{\\phi_i - \\phi_o}{L} = \\frac{V_m}{L}$, where $V_m$ is the membrane potential.\n\nSubstituting the constant field into the Nernst-Planck equation, we obtain a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $C_s(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_s}{dx} + \\frac{z_s F V_m}{RT L} C_s = -\\frac{j_s}{D_s}\n$$\nUnder steady-state conditions, $j_s$ must be constant across the membrane. This equation can be solved by integrating across the membrane from $x=0$ (outside, concentration $[s]_o$) to $x=L$ (inside, concentration $[s]_i$). The solution for the flux density $j_s$ is:\n$$\nj_s = -P_s \\frac{z_s F V_m}{RT} \\left( \\frac{[s]_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_s F V_m}{RT}\\right) - [s]_o}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{z_s F V_m}{RT}\\right) - 1} \\right)\n$$\nwhere the permeability $P_s$ is related to the diffusion coefficient by $P_s = D_s/L$ (assuming partition coefficients are unity, which is implicit in this model).\n\nThe electric current density carried by ion $s$ is $J_s = z_s F j_s$. Let $u = \\frac{F V_m}{RT}$.\n$$\nJ_s = -z_s^2 F^2 P_s \\frac{V_m}{RT} \\left( \\frac{[s]_i \\exp(z_s u) - [s]_o}{\\exp(z_s u) - 1} \\right)\n$$\nThe steady-state condition is that the total ionic current across the membrane is zero: $\\sum_s J_s = 0$.
