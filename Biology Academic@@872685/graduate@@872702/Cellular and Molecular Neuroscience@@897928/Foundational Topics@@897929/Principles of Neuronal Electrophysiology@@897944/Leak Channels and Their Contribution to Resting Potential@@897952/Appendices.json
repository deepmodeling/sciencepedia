We expand the terms:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{K}} V_{\\text{rest}} - g_{\\mathrm{K}} E_{\\mathrm{K}} + g_{\\mathrm{Na}} V_{\\text{rest}} - g_{\\mathrm{Na}} E_{\\mathrm{Na}} + g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} V_{\\text{rest}} - g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = 0$$\nGroup the terms containing $V_{\\text{rest}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{rest}}(g_{\\mathrm{K}} + g_{\\mathrm{Na}} + g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}) = g_{\\mathrm{K}} E_{\\mathrm{K}} + g_{\\mathrm{Na}} E_{\\mathrm{Na}} + g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$$\nIsolating $V_{\\text{rest}}$ yields the expression for the resting potential, which is a weighted average of the reversal potentials where the conductances serve as the weights:\n$$V_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{K}} E_{\\mathrm{K}} + g_{\\mathrm{Na}} E_{\\mathrm{Na}} + g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}}{g_{\\mathrm{K}} + g_{\\mathrm{Na}} + g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}}$$\nThis equation shows the explicit dependence of $V_{\\text{rest}}$ on $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\n\nTo demonstrate that increasing $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ moves $V_{\\text{rest}}$ toward $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, we analyze the rate of change of $V_{\\text{rest}}$ with respect to $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$. We compute the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial V_{\\text{rest}}}{\\partial g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}}$, treating all other parameters ($g_{\\mathrm{K}}$, $g_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$) as constants.

Therefore, the sign of the derivative is determined by the sign of the term $(E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} - V_{\\text{rest}})$.\n- If $V_{\\text{rest}}  E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, then $(E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} - V_{\\text{rest}})  0$, so $\\frac{\\partial V_{\\text{rest}}}{\\partial g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}}  0$. An increase in $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ leads to an increase in $V_{\\text{rest}}$, moving it toward $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\n- If $V_{\\text{rest}}  E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, then $(E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} - V_{\\text{rest}})  0$, so $\\frac{\\partial V_{\\text{rest}}}{\\partial g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}}  0$. An increase in $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ leads to a decrease in $V_{\\text{rest}}$, also moving it toward $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\n- If $V_{\\text{rest}} = E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, then $\\frac{\\partial V_{\\text{rest}}}{\\partial g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}} = 0$, and the system is at equilibrium with respect to chloride.\n\nThis analysis rigorously demonstrates that increasing the chloride leak conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, invariably moves the resting potential $V_{\\text{rest}}$ closer to the chloride reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the change in resting potential, $\\Delta V_{\\text{rest}}$, when $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ is doubled.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The model is a standard, simplified representation used in cellular biophysics to illustrate fundamental principles of membrane potential and ion transport. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two currents under steady-state conditions: the sodium leak current, $I_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}}$, and the compensatory current from the sodium-potassium pump, $I_{\\mathrm{pump}}$.\n\nFirst, we address the sodium leak current, $I_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}}$. The problem states that the sodium leak pathway, mediated by the NALCN channel, behaves as an ohmic conductor. In cellular electrophysiology, the current ($I$) flowing through an ohmic ion channel is described by a form of Ohm's law, which relates the current to the channel's conductance ($g$) and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential ($V$) and the ion's reversal potential ($E_{\\text{rev}}$).\n\nThe formula is given by:\n$$I = g (V - E_{\\text{rev}})$$\n\nFor the specific case of the sodium leak channel, this becomes:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}} = g_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}} (V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}})$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Sodium leak conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}$.\n-   Membrane potential, $V = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -65 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n-   Sodium reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = +60\\,\\mathrm{mV} = +60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe sign convention is given as positive current corresponding to a net outward flow of positive charge. Our formula is consistent with this convention: if $V > E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, the driving force $(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}})$ is positive, driving an outward current of $\\text{Na}^+$ ions, resulting in $I > 0$. Conversely, if $V  E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, the driving force is negative, driving an inward current of $\\text{Na}^+$ ions, resulting in $I  0$.\n\nWe substitute the given values into the equation for $I_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}} = (2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times ((-65 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) - (60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}))$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}} = (2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (-125 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V})$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}} = -250 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in picoamperes ($\\mathrm{pA}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{pA} = 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$. Therefore:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Na,leak}} = -250\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\nThis negative sign correctly indicates an inward current, or an influx of positive sodium ions, as expected when the membrane potential is substantially more negative than the sodium reversal potential.\n\nSecond, we calculate the compensatory pump current, $I_{\\mathrm{pump}}$. The problem specifies that the system is at steady state. A fundamental condition for steady state in a membrane patch is that the net transmembrane current must be zero. This is a direct application of Kirchhoff's current law.\n$$I_{\\text{net}} = \\sum_{k} I_k = 0$$\n\nThe problem states that the only two electrogenic pathways present are the sodium leak channel and the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase pump.
