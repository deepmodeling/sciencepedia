We begin by establishing the governing differential equation from first principles.\n\nLet $\\Delta V(t) = V(t) - V_{\\text{rest}}$ be the deflection of the membrane potential from its resting value. For simplicity, we shall denote this deflection by $V(t)$. The injected current, $I_{0}$, for $t \\ge 0$, is distributed between the resistive (ionic leak) pathway and the capacitive pathway of the membrane. The principle of charge conservation, equivalent to Kirchhoff's Current Law, states that the total injected current must equal the sum of the resistive current, $I_{R}$, and the capacitive current, $I_{C}$.\n$$I_{0} = I_{R}(t) + I_{C}(t)$$\nThe problem specifies subthreshold linearization about rest. This implies that the total ionic leak current is linearly proportional to the voltage deflection. This relationship is described by Ohm's law, where the constant of proportionality is the input resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\n$$I_{R}(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nThe capacitive current is proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the membrane capacitance, $C$.\n$$I_{C}(t) = C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\nCombining these expressions gives the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the voltage deflection $V(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$I_{0} = \\frac{V(t)}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}} + C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\n\n1) Computation of Input Resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\nThe input resistance is determined from the steady-state response. As time approaches infinity ($t \\to \\infty$), the membrane potential reaches a new constant value, the steady-state deflection $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, which we denote as $V_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. In this steady-state condition, the voltage is no longer changing, so the time derivative of the voltage is zero:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = 0$$\nAt this point, the capacitive current $I_{C}$ becomes zero, and the entire injected current $I_{0}$ flows through the resistive pathway. The governing equation simplifies to:\n$$I_{0} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nThis is the definition of the input resistance. We are given $I_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ and $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. We solve for $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{I_{0}} = \\frac{4 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}}{20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\Omega = 200 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega$$\nThus, the input resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{in}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{M\\Omega}$.\n\n2) Computation of Membrane Capacitance, $C$:\nThe membrane capacitance is determined from the initial response immediately after the current step is applied at $t=0$. The initial condition is that the membrane is at its resting potential, so the voltage deflection at $t=0$ is $V(0) = 0$. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously. Therefore, the voltage deflection immediately after the current injection, at $t=0^{+}$, is still zero: $V(0^{+}) = 0$.\nEvaluating the governing differential equation at $t=0^{+}$:\n$$I_{0} = \\frac{V(0^{+})}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}} + C \\left.\\frac{dV}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}$$\nSubstituting $V(0^{+}) = 0$, the resistive current term vanishes:\n$$I_{0} = C \\left.\\frac{dV}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}$$\nAt this instant, the entire injected current serves to charge the membrane capacitance. We are given $I_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ and the initial slope $\\left.\\frac{dV}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mV/ms}$. Before computing $C$, we must ensure consistent units.\n$$\\left.\\frac{dV}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}} = 0.10 \\frac{\\mathrm{mV}}{\\mathrm{ms}} = 0.10 \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{V/s}$$\nNow we solve for $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{I_{0}}{\\left.\\frac{dV}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{0.10\\,\\mathrm{V/s}} = 200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\nThus, the membrane capacitance is $C = 200\\,\\mathrm{pF}$.\n\n3) Computation and Justification of Membrane Time Constant, $\\tau_{m}$:\nTo justify the use of $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ in the expression for the time constant, we rearrange the governing differential equation into its standard form.\n$$I_{0} = \\frac{V(t)}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}} + C \\frac{dV}{dt}$$\nMultiplying by $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ yields:\n$$I_{0}R_{\\mathrm{in}} = V(t) + R_{\\mathrm{in}}C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\nReordering the terms gives:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in}}C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} + V(t) = I_{0}R_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\nThis equation is a canonical first-order linear ordinary differential equation of the form $\\tau \\frac{dy}{dt} + y = f(t)$, where the coefficient of the derivative term, $\\tau$, is the time constant of the system. By direct comparison, the membrane time constant $\\tau_{m}$ is precisely the product of the input resistance and the membrane capacitance:\n$$\\tau_{m} = R_{\\mathrm{in}}C$$\nThis a priori justification confirms that the input resistance $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, which characterizes the passive steady-state leak, is the correct resistance to use. It is this resistance which, in parallel with the capacitance $C$, governs the temporal dynamics of the voltage response in the subthreshold regime.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of $\\tau_{m}$ using the previously determined values for $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $C$:\n$$\\tau_{m} = (200 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega) \\times (200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}) = 40000 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 4 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$).\n$$\\tau_{m} = 4 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{ms}}{1\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nFinally, we round this result to three significant figures as instructed:\n$$\\tau_{m} = 40.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{40.0}$$", "id": "2737086"}, {"introduction": "Real neurons have complex spatial structures, like long axons, where voltage signals decay with distance.
