It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cellular electrophysiology, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the derivation from first principles, followed by the numerical calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for a relationship between the input resistance, $R_{in}$, the specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, and the total surface area, $A$, of an isopotential soma. We are instructed to use only Ohm's law and the definition of specific membrane resistance.\n\nFirst, we define the input resistance, $R_{in}$, for the entire soma. By Ohm's law, this is the ratio of the steady-state change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_m$, to the total injected current, $I$:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_m}{I}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that a direct current $I$ is injected and the system reaches a steady state, at which point the capacitive current is zero. All injected current must therefore exit the cell as ionic leak current through the membrane.\n\nSecond, we consider the local properties of the membrane. The specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, is defined as the resistance of a unit area of the membrane. It relates the local membrane potential change, $\\Delta V_m$, to the density of the current, $J_m$, flowing across that unit area. This relationship is a form of Ohm's law applied per unit area:\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = J_m \\cdot R_m\n$$\nNote the units: if $\\Delta V_m$ is in Volts ($V$), and $J_m$ is in Amperes per square meter ($A/m^2$), then $R_m$ must be in Ohm-square meters ($\\Omega \\cdot m^2$). The problem states the soma is isopotential, which means $\\Delta V_m$ is uniform across the entire surface. Consequently, the current density $J_m$ must also be uniform across the entire membrane area $A$.\n\nThird, we relate the total current $I$ to the current density $J_m$. Since the current density is uniform over the total surface area $A$, the total current leaving the cell is the product of the current density and the area:\n$$\nI = J_m \\cdot A\n$$\nWe now have a system of three equations. Our objective is to find an expression for $R_{in}$ in terms of $R_m$ and $A$.\n\nFrom the equation for total current, we can express the current density as:\n$$\nJ_m = \\frac{I}{A}\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $J_m$ into the equation for the specific membrane resistance:\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\left(\\frac{I}{A}\\right) \\cdot R_m\n$$\nThis equation links the membrane potential change to the injected current and the cell's physical properties. Now, we substitute this expression for $\\Delta V_m$ into the definition of input resistance:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_m}{I} = \\frac{\\frac{I \\cdot R_m}{A}}{I}\n$$\nThe total current $I$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the desired relationship:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{R_m}{A}\n$$\nThis result is fundamental. It shows that the input resistance of an isopotential cell is inversely proportional to its surface area. A larger cell has a lower input resistance.\n\nNext, we are required to compute the numerical value of $R_{in}$ using the provided data:\n$R_m = 20\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$\n$A = 1{,}200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nTo perform this calculation, the units must be consistent.

The analysis must proceed from first principles.\n\nThe electrical circuit model is composed of a membrane resistance $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$ in parallel with a membrane capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This parallel group is in series with an access resistance $R_{s}$. A current source injects a step current of amplitude $I$ at time $t=0$.

The recorded voltage at the pipette, $V_{\\mathrm{rec}}(t)$, is the sum of these two potentials, relative to ground. The resting potential of the cell is assumed to be $0$ V for simplicity, so all calculated voltages represent changes from rest.\n\nFrom Kirchhoff's Voltage Law applied to the circuit, we have:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{rec}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{m}}(t) + V_{s}(t)\n$$\nThe total injected current $I$ flows through the series resistor $R_{s}$, so by Ohm's law, the voltage drop across it is constant for $t>0$:\n$$\nV_{s}(t) = I R_{s}\n$$\nThus, the recorded voltage is:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{rec}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{m}}(t) + I R_{s}\n$$\nThe injected current $I$, after passing through $R_{s}$, splits into a resistive current $I_{R}$ flowing through $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and a capacitive current $I_{C}$ flowing through $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$.

The solution to this differential equation is the sum of a homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation has a solution of the form $A \\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})$, where the membrane time constant is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = R_{\\mathrm{m}} C_{\\mathrm{m}}$.

Thus, $V_{\\mathrm{m}}(0^{+}) = V_{\\mathrm{m}}(0^{-}) = 0$. The recorded voltage makes an instantaneous jump:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{0} = V_{\\mathrm{rec}}(0^{+}) = V_{\\mathrm{m}}(0^{+}) + I R_{s} = 0 + I R_{s} = I R_{s}\n$$\nFrom this, it is immediately obvious how to determine the series resistance from the initial voltage jump $\\Delta V_{0}$ and the current amplitude $I$:\n$$\nR_{s} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{0}}{I}\n$$\nAs time approaches infinity ($t \\to \\infty$), the circuit reaches a steady state. The capacitor is fully charged and acts as an open circuit ($dV_{\\mathrm{m}}/dt \\to 0$, so $I_{C} \\to 0$). All injected current $I$ flows through the membrane resistor $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$.

The results will be converted from Ohms ($\\Omega$) to Megaohms (M$\\Omega$) and rounded as required.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the input resistance of a passive cylindrical neurite for a suite of test cases.\n\n    The solution is based on the analytical derivation from the one-dimensional, \n    steady-state passive cable equation for a finite cable with a sealed end.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases as a list of tuples.\n    # Each tuple contains (Rm, Ri, a, L) in units (Ohm.m^2, Ohm.m, m, m).\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (baseline)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-3),\n        # Case 2 (increase Rm)\n        (2.0, 1.0, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-3),\n        # Case 3 (increase Ri)\n        (1.0, 2.0, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-3),\n        # Case 4 (increase a)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 2.0e-6, 1.0e-3),\n        # Case 5 (short cable limit)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6),\n        # Case 6 (long cable limit)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-2),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        Rm, Ri, a, L = case\n        \n        # Calculate resistance per unit length for membrane (r_m) and axoplasm (r_a).\n        # r_m has units Ohm.m\n        # r_a has units Ohm/m\n        r_a = Ri / (np.pi * a**2)\n        r_m = Rm / (2 * np.pi * a)\n        \n        # Calculate the space constant (lambda) and the characteristic resistance (R_inf).\n        # R_inf is the input resistance of an infinitely long cable.\n        lambda_const = np.sqrt(r_m / r_a)\n        R_inf = np.sqrt(r_a * r_m)\n        \n        # Calculate the dimensionless length of the cable.\n        L_norm = L / lambda_const\n        \n        # Calculate the input resistance (R_in) in Ohms.\n        # The formula for a finite cable with a sealed end is R_in = R_inf * coth(L/lambda).\n        # numpy.coth does not exist, so we use 1 / numpy.tanh.\n        R_in_ohms = R_inf * (1 / np.tanh(L_norm))\n        \n        # Convert the result from Ohms to Megaohms (1 MOhm = 1e6 Ohm).\n        R_in_megaohms = R_in_ohms / 1e6\n        \n        results.append(R_in_megaohms)\n\n    # Format each result to six decimal places and join into a single string.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    \n    # Print the final output in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2724489"}]}
