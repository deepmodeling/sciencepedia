This first practice establishes a direct link between this microscopic time window and a macroscopic functional property: the maximum firing rate. By performing this straightforward calculation, you will develop a tangible understanding of how biophysical constraints shape the information processing capabilities of neural circuits [@problem_id:2326075].", "problem": "In computational neuroscience, the firing rate of a neuron is a fundamental variable for encoding information. The biophysical properties of the neuron's membrane impose a physical limit on how fast it can fire. Following an action potential, there is a span of time called the absolute refractory period, during which the voltage-gated sodium channels are inactivated, making it impossible to trigger a subsequent action potential, regardless of the stimulus strength. For a particular interneuron being modeled, this absolute refractory period is measured to be 2.5 milliseconds. Based on this property, calculate the theoretical maximum rate at which this neuron can transmit information via action potentials. Express your answer for this maximum frequency in Hertz (Hz).", "solution": "The absolute refractory period sets the minimum possible interspike interval because no new action potential can occur during this time. Therefore, the theoretical maximum firing rate is the reciprocal of the absolute refractory period.\n\nLet $T_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ denote the absolute refractory period. Then the maximum firing frequency is\n$$\nf_{\\max}=\\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{abs}}}.\n$$\nGiven $T_{\\mathrm{abs}}=2.5\\ \\mathrm{ms}=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$, we compute\n$$\nf_{\\max}=\\frac{1}{2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}}=\\frac{1}{2.5}\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}=0.4\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}=400\\ \\mathrm{Hz}.\n$$\nThus, the theoretical maximum firing rate is $400$ Hz.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{400}$$", "id": "2326075"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the functional consequences of the absolute refractory period, we now investigate its underlying biophysical mechanism: the inactivation and subsequent recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels. This exercise simulates a classic two-pulse voltage-clamp protocol, a cornerstone experimental technique in neurophysiology for studying ion channel kinetics. By analyzing the hypothetical data, you will quantify the time-dependent recovery of sodium channels, providing a clear view of the molecular events that govern the termination of the absolute refractory period [@problem_id:2326030].", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is studying the properties of voltage-gated sodium channels in a squid giant axon using a two-pulse voltage-clamp protocol. The axon is initially held at a membrane potential of -80 mV, where most sodium channels are in a closed, resting state.\n\nThe experimental protocol consists of two identical, square voltage pulses.\n1.  A first depolarizing pulse to 0 mV is applied for a duration of 5 ms. This pulse elicits a peak inward current with a magnitude of 1.80 nA.\n2.  The membrane potential is then returned to the holding potential of -80 mV for a brief inter-pulse interval of 3.0 ms.\n3.  A second, identical depolarizing pulse to 0 mV is applied. This pulse elicits a peak inward current with a magnitude of 0.72 nA.\n\nAssume that the magnitude of the peak inward sodium current is directly proportional to the number of sodium channels available to open at the onset of the depolarization. Based on these experimental results, calculate the fraction of the voltage-gated sodium channels that were available to open at the start of the second pulse, relative to the number that were available at the start of the first pulse.
