Each gap junction channel is formed by the docking of two hemichannels (connexons), each composed of six connexin subunits, and at small transjunctional voltages behaves approximately as an ohmic conductor.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution. The data provided are physiologically realistic for the specified context of neuronal gap junctions. The problem is a direct application of fundamental electrical principles to a biological system.\n\nThe core of this problem rests on two fundamental principles of electricity applied to the context of ion channels. First is Ohm's law, which in terms of electrical conductance $G$ is stated as:\n$$G = \\frac{I}{V}$$\nwhere $I$ is the current flowing through a conductor and $V$ is the voltage drop across it.\n\nSecond is the rule for combining conductances in parallel. If a set of $N$ independent conductors are arranged in parallel, the total conductance $G_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of their individual conductances $g_i$:\n$$G_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i$$\nThe problem specifies that the gap junction is comprised of identical channels operating in parallel. If each of these $N$ channels has the same unitary conductance, which we denote by $\\gamma$, the total junctional conductance $G_j$ is simply:\n$$G_j = N \\gamma$$\n\nWe are given the macroscopic experimental data: a steady transjunctional voltage $V_j = 15 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and the corresponding steady junctional current $I_j = 13.5 \\ \\mathrm{pA}$. Using Ohm's law, we can compute the total macroscopic conductance of the gap junction, $G_j$:\n$$G_j = \\frac{I_j}{V_j}$$\n\nWe can now equate the macroscopic characterization of the junctional conductance with its microscopic composition:\n$$N \\gamma = \\frac{I_j}{V_j}$$\nOur objective is to solve for $N$, the number of open channels:\n$$N = \\frac{I_j}{V_j \\gamma}$$\n\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure consistency in units. The standard SI units are Volts ($V$), Amperes ($A$), and Siemens ($S$).\nThe given values are:\n$V_j = 15 \\ \\mathrm{mV} = 15 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n$I_j = 13.5 \\ \\mathrm{pA} = 13.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{A}$\n$\\gamma = 15 \\ \\mathrm{pS} = 15 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{S}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{13.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{A}}{(15 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{V}) \\times (15 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{S})}$$\nThe units correctly cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity as required for a count. We proceed with the arithmetic:\n$$N = \\frac{13.5 \\times 10^{-12}}{225 \\times 10^{-15}}$$\n$$N = \\frac{13.5}{225 \\times 10^{-3}}$$\n$$N = \\frac{13500}{225}$$\n$$N = 60$$\n\nThis calculation yields an exact integer, as specified in the problem statement. This integer, $60$, represents the number of open channels.\n\nThe validity of this estimate is contingent upon several key assumptions:\n$1$. The entire measured junctional current $I_j$ flows exclusively through the connexin$36$ gap junction channels. This model neglects any other potential conductive pathways between the two cells, such as other types of ion channels in the junctional membrane or non-specific electrical leakage.\n$2$. The system behaves as a population of identical and independent channels, each contributing $\\gamma$ to the total conductance when open.\n$3$. The channels are ohmic conductors, meaning their conductance $\\gamma$ is constant and independent of the transjunctional voltage $V_j$ in the range considered. The problem states this is an approximation for small voltages.\n$4$. The measurement is taken at steady-state, implying that the number of open channels $N$ is stable during the measurement period.\n\nThe result $N=60$ represents the *minimum* number of open channels for a specific reason. The calculation assumes that every channel contributing to the current is in its *fully open state*, exhibiting the maximal unitary conductance $\\gamma = 15 \\ \\mathrm{pS}$. In reality, many ion channels, including connexins, can exhibit sub-conductance states, where a channel is partially open and has an effective conductance less than $\\gamma$. If some of the channels were in such sub-conductance states, a larger total number of channels would be required to produce the same macroscopic conductance $G_j$. Therefore, by assuming all channels are fully open, we calculate the smallest possible population of channels that can account for the observed current.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{60}\n$$", "id": "2755014"}, {"introduction": "The functional strength of an electrical synapse is not determined solely by the properties of the gap junction itself, but also by how it interacts with the neurons it connects.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved using fundamental principles of circuit analysis. I will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system can be modeled as an electrical circuit with two nodes, representing neuron 1 and neuron 2. The voltages at these nodes relative to ground are $\\Delta V_1$ and $\\Delta V_2$.\n\n- Neuron 1 is a node connected to ground via its input resistance $R_1$.\n- Neuron 2 is a node connected to ground via its input resistance $R_2$.\n- A junctional resistor $R_j$ connects neuron 1 and neuron 2.\n- A current source injects a steady current $I$ into neuron 1.\n\nWe apply Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL), which states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node is zero.\n\nFor node 1, the injected current $I$ must equal the sum of the currents leaving the node:\n1.

Let's compare it to the correct one. If this were equal to option A, then $R_2/(R_2+R_j) = R_1 R_2 / (R_1 R_2 + R_j(R_1+R_2))$. Cross-multiplying gives $R_2(R_1 R_2 + R_j R_1 + R_j R_2) = R_1 R_2(R_2+R_j)$, which simplifies to $R_j R_2^2 = 0$. This is only true if $R_j = 0$ or $R_2 = 0$, which is not generally the case.

I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe task is to identify which experimental controls can convincingly distinguish gap junction-mediated transfer from transfer via cytoplasmic bridges or a leak through undocked hemichannels. Each option must be evaluated against the provided foundational bases.\n\n**Option A: Use neurons lacking connexin-$36$ (connexin, abbreviated Cx, isoform $36$) and show that both dye spread and junctional conductance $G_j$ are abolished, and that re-expression of Cx$36$ restores both phenotypes.**\n- **Analysis:** This experiment tests for molecular necessity and sufficiency. According to basis (v), connexin proteins are required to form gap junctions. Cx$36$ is the primary gap junction protein in most mature neurons. If dye transfer is mediated by Cx$36$ gap junctions, then removing the Cx$36$ gene (knockout) must eliminate the transfer. Re-expressing the gene should rescue the phenotype. This control directly links the specific molecule (Cx$36$) to the function (dye transfer). Furthermore, it links dye transfer to electrical coupling ($G_j$), a hallmark of gap junctions (basis iv). Cytoplasmic bridges are not made of connexins, so their function would be unaffected by Cx$36$ knockout. While hemichannels are made of connexins, this experiment demonstrates that not only dye transfer but also the *junctional conductance* $G_j$ is dependent on Cx$36$. A hemichannel leak mechanism does not establish a junctional conductance between two cells. Therefore, the coupled loss and restoration of both dye spread and $G_j$ is exceptionally strong evidence for gap junctions.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option B: Co-load the injected neuron with a small tracer plus a fluorescent dextran of $\\geq 10 \\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, and verify that only the small tracer spreads to neighbors while the large dextran and fluorescent proteins remain confined to the injected cell.**\n- **Analysis:** This experiment tests the size selectivity of the pathway. According to basis (iv), gap junctions impose a size cutoff of approximately $1 \\,\\mathrm{kDa}$. A dextran of $10 \\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ is significantly larger and should not pass. In contrast, basis (iii) states that cytoplasmic bridges provide continuous cytoplasm with minimal size cutoff, which would readily allow passage of a $10 \\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ molecule. Therefore, observing that the large dextran is retained in the injected cell while the small tracer passes is strong evidence *against* the presence of cytoplasmic bridges. It is consistent with transfer through a size-selective pore like a gap junction. While this test alone does not distinguish gap junctions from hemichannels (which also have a size limit), it is a critical control for ruling out cytoplasmic bridges.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option C: Demonstrate that bath application of the small tracer under normal extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ produces no cellular uptake, whereas lowering extracellular divalent cations triggers dye entry from the bath; then perform all coupling measurements under normal divalent conditions and confirm that only intracellular loading produces intercellular spread.**\n- **Analysis:** This experiment is designed to specifically test and rule out the hemichannel leak hypothesis. The leak mechanism requires two steps: (1) dye efflux from the injected cell via hemichannels into the extracellular space, and (2) dye influx into the adjacent cell via its hemichannels. Basis (ii) states that hemichannel opening is strongly inhibited by physiological extracellular divalent cation concentrations. The proposed control first verifies this principle: it shows that cells only take up dye from the external medium (influx step) when divalent cations are lowered, i.e., when hemichannels are forced open. Then, the actual coupling experiment is performed under normal physiological conditions where, as just demonstrated, hemichannel-mediated uptake is inhibited. If dye spread between cells still occurs under these conditions, it cannot be explained by the leak-and-uptake mechanism via hemichannels. This elegantly isolates the intercellular transfer from a potential artifact involving hemichannels and the extracellular space.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option D: Correlate dye coupling with the ultrastructural presence of gap junction plaques at contacting membranes using freeze-fracture electron microscopy, and absence of any membrane continuities consistent with cytoplasmic bridges between the coupled cells.**\n- **Analysis:** This is an anatomical approach to provide direct structural evidence. According to basis (i), gap junctions are specific structures visible with electron microscopy as plaques of intramembrane particles. Basis (iii) describes cytoplasmic bridges as direct continuities of the cytoplasm and membrane. This experiment proposes to use a powerful imaging technique to look for the presence of the candidate structure (gap junction plaques) and the absence of the alternative structure (cytoplasmic bridges) specifically at the interface between cells that are shown to be coupled. A strong correlation—where coupled cell pairs consistently show gap junction plaques and no bridges, while uncoupled pairs lack such plaques—provides compelling evidence that the observed function is mediated by the observed structure.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option E: Chelate extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ during the assay to minimize hemichannel opening and thereby prevent hemichannel-mediated dye movement.**\n- **Analysis:** This proposal is based on a flawed premise. Basis (ii) states that the open probability of undocked hemichannels is strongly *reduced* by physiological extracellular divalent cations. This implies that *removing* or chelating extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ would *increase* their open probability. Therefore, the proposed action would exacerbate, not minimize, potential hemichannel-mediated leak. This control would not support the desired conclusion; in fact, it would confound the interpretation.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option F: Block voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels with tetrodotoxin to exclude action potential–dependent influences on dye spread, interpreting persistence of spread as evidence for gap junction mediation.**\n- **Analysis:** This control tests whether the dye transfer requires action potentials. Passive diffusion of a small molecule down its concentration gradient through a pre-existing pore (gap junction) or bridge (cytoplasmic bridge) does not require action potentials. A simple hemichannel leak mechanism is also primarily a passive process. Showing that dye transfer persists after blocking action potentials confirms that the mechanism is independent of sodium-channel-mediated neuronal firing. However, this finding is consistent with all three possibilities (gap junctions, cytoplasmic bridges, and hemichannel leak). It therefore lacks the discriminatory power to distinguish between them. It rules out a different, unrelated hypothesis, but does not help resolve the central question.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, options A, B, C, and D each provide a powerful and distinct line of evidence—molecular, biophysical, pharmacological, and anatomical, respectively—that supports the conclusion of gap junction-mediated transfer while helping to rule out the specified alternatives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2754927"}]}
