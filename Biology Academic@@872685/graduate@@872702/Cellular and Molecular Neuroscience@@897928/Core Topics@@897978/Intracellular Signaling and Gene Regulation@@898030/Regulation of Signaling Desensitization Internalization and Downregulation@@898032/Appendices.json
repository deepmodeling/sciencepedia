This practice employs a foundational technique in molecular biology—site-directed mutagenesis—to probe the \"phosphorylation code\" that governs G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization. By replacing key phospho-acceptor sites with either a non-phosphorylatable residue (alanine) or a residue that electrostatically mimics phosphorylation (aspartate), you can deconstruct the specific contribution of this post-translational modification to both basal and agonist-induced receptor regulation [@problem_id:2746773].", "problem": "A laboratory is dissecting the mechanisms of receptor desensitization in a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In wild-type receptors, agonist binding stabilizes an active conformation that is recognized by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRKs phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on the receptor cytoplasmic domains, and the added negative charge drives high-affinity recruitment of β-arrestins. β-arrestins uncouple the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins (acute desensitization) and scaffold clathrin-mediated endocytosis (internalization), which can lead to longer-term receptor downregulation. To decouple basal from agonist-induced processes, the lab generates two mutants in which all GRK-targeted serine and threonine residues in the receptor tail are replaced either with alanine or with aspartate. Alanine cannot be phosphorylated and does not carry a negative charge; aspartate cannot be phosphorylated at those positions but does carry a constitutive negative charge that can mimic a phosphate electrostatically.\n\nAssume the following well-tested facts: GRKs preferentially act on the active receptor conformation stabilized by agonist; receptor phosphorylation promotes β-arrestin engagement; β-arrestin recruitment reduces G protein signaling and promotes internalization; alanine substitution of phosphoacceptor sites prevents phosphorylation; aspartate substitution can partially mimic the negative charge of phosphorylation and thereby promote arrestin engagement even without phosphorylation.

This active conformation is recognized by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRKs phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on the receptor's cytoplasmic domains. The resulting negative charge from phosphate groups drives high-affinity recruitment of β-arrestins. β-arrestins perform two functions: (a) uncouple the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins (acute desensitization) and (b) scaffold clathrin-mediated endocytosis, leading to internalization and potential downregulation.\n2.  **Mutants**: Two mutants are generated where all GRK-targeted serine and threonine residues are replaced.\n    *   **Alanine Mutant**: All sites are replaced with alanine.\n    *   **Aspartate Mutant**: All sites are replaced with aspartate.\n3.  **Properties of Amino Acid Substitutions**:\n    *   **Alanine**: Cannot be phosphorylated and does not carry a charge. It is a phosphonull substitution.\n    *   **Aspartate**: Cannot be phosphorylated at these sites but carries a constitutive negative charge, acting as a phosphomimetic substitution.\n4.  **Governing Assumptions**:\n    *   GRKs preferentially act on the active, agonist-bound receptor conformation.\n    *   Receptor phosphorylation is the trigger that promotes β-arrestin engagement.\n    *   β-arrestin recruitment causes G protein uncoupling (desensitization) and promotes receptor internalization.\n    *   Alanine substitution prevents phosphorylation.\n    *   Aspartate substitution's negative charge promotes β-arrestin engagement without phosphorylation.\n    *   No other signaling pathways are altered.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria.\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in the established principles of cellular and molecular neuroscience, specifically G protein-coupled receptor signaling. The described desensitization pathway involving GRKs and β-arrestins is a canonical mechanism. The experimental strategy of using phosphonull (alanine) and phosphomimetic (aspartate) mutations is a standard, valid technique used to investigate the functional role of phosphorylation events in signal transduction. All premises are factually sound and scientifically accepted.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured. It provides a set of initial conditions (wild-type mechanism, mutant properties) and asks for a logical prediction of the system's behavior. The question is unambiguous and a unique solution can be derived from the provided information.\n*   **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or biased statements. It describes a hypothetical but realistic experimental scenario.\n*   The problem does not suffer from any of the specified flaws. It is not based on false premises, it is directly relevant to the topic, it provides a complete set of rules, the conditions are plausible, and it requires substantive reasoning based on the provided principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution will now be derived.\n\nDerivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires a systematic analysis of how each mutation alters the canonical desensitization pathway compared to the wild-type receptor. We must consider both the basal (agonist-absent) and agonist-induced states.\n\n**Analysis of the Alanine Mutant**\nThe alanine mutant replaces all target serine and threonine residues with alanine. Alanine cannot be phosphorylated by GRKs and its side chain is uncharged.\n1.  **Effect on Phosphorylation**: The primary molecular event required for β-arrestin recruitment—phosphorylation of the receptor tail by GRKs—is completely abolished in this mutant.\n2.  **Basal State**: In the wild-type system, there is a low level of basal receptor activity and corresponding GRK-mediated phosphorylation, which leads to a basal level of desensitization and internalization. Since the alanine mutant receptor cannot be phosphorylated, this basal phosphorylation-dependent desensitization is eliminated. Consequently, the alanine mutant will exhibit **reduced basal desensitization** compared to the wild-type receptor. Without the braking mechanism, the receptor should remain more coupled to G proteins in the basal state.\n3.  **Agonist-Induced State**: Upon agonist stimulation, the wild-type receptor is robustly phosphorylated by GRKs, leading to strong recruitment of β-arrestin, rapid G protein uncoupling (desensitization), and subsequent internalization. In the alanine mutant, agonist binding still activates the receptor, but the critical downstream step of phosphorylation cannot occur. Without the addition of negative charges, β-arrestin cannot be recruited with high affinity. As a result, agonist-induced desensitization will be **markedly blunted and slower**. Because β-arrestin also mediates endocytosis, **internalization will be severely impaired**.\n\n**Analysis of the Aspartate Mutant**\nThe aspartate mutant replaces all target serine and threonine residues with aspartate. Aspartate carries a constitutive negative charge that mimics the electrostatic properties of a phosphate group.\n1.  **Effect on Phosphorylation**: The receptor is constitutively \"phosphorylated\" in an electrostatic sense, but can no longer be dynamically regulated by GRKs at these sites.\n2.  **Basal State**: The constitutive negative charges on the receptor's cytoplasmic domains will promote the binding of β-arrestin even in the absence of agonist stimulation. This pre-recruitment of β-arrestin will lead to G protein uncoupling and receptor internalization without the need for an agonist. Therefore, the aspartate mutant will exhibit **elevated basal desensitization** and **constitutive internalization**, far exceeding the levels seen in the wild-type receptor.\n3.  **Agonist-Induced State**: The receptor is already in a highly desensitized and internalized state due to constitutive β-arrestin binding. When an agonist is added, the receptor conformation will change to the active state. While GRKs preferentially recognize this active state, the substrate sites for phosphorylation are absent. The primary signal for enhanced β-arrestin recruitment (the accumulation of negative charge) is already present and fixed. Therefore, the addition of an agonist will produce **little additional agonist-induced desensitization or internalization** beyond the already high basal state. The system is essentially locked in a desensitized state.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Alanine mutant: reduced basal desensitization, markedly blunted and slower agonist-induced desensitization, and impaired internalization; Aspartate mutant: elevated basal desensitization with constitutive internalization and little additional agonist-induced desensitization beyond the basal state.**\n    This option precisely matches the derived conclusions for both the alanine mutant (abolished phosphorylation leads to reduced desensitization) and the aspartate mutant (constitutive negative charge leads to high basal desensitization with little further inducibility).\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Alanine mutant: increased basal desensitization due to enhanced GRK access and faster agonist-induced desensitization; Aspartate mutant: decreased basal and agonist-induced desensitization because the sites can no longer be phosphorylated.**\n    This option is incorrect. For the alanine mutant, desensitization is reduced, not increased, because the mechanism for desensitization (phosphorylation) is removed. For the aspartate mutant, desensitization is increased, not decreased, because it constitutively mimics the phosphorylated state.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Alanine mutant: unchanged basal desensitization with enhanced agonist-induced desensitization because alanine increases GRK binding dynamics; Aspartate mutant: no change in either basal or agonist-induced desensitization relative to wild-type.**\n    This option is incorrect. For the alanine mutant, basal desensitization is reduced and agonist-induced desensitization is blunted, not enhanced. The claim about alanine's effect on GRK binding is unsubstantiated and contrary to the given principles. For the aspartate mutant, the constitutive charge profoundly alters desensitization profiles; they are not unchanged.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Alanine mutant: reduced basal desensitization but largely normal agonist-induced desensitization due to compensation by protein kinase A (PKA); Aspartate mutant: normal basal desensitization but enhanced agonist-induced desensitization owing to improved GRK recognition of negatively charged sites.**\n    This option is incorrect. For the alanine mutant, invoking compensation by PKA violates the problem's constraint that \"No other pathways are altered.\" Furthermore, the loss of the primary GRK-mediated pathway would not result in \"largely normal\" desensitization. For the aspartate mutant, basal desensitization would be elevated, not normal, and the agonist-induced effect would be minimal, not enhanced.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2746773"}, {"introduction": "Complex cellular processes are often dissected using specific pharmacological inhibitors that act as molecular scalpels.

The roles of GPCRs, agonists, β-arrestin, dynamin, endocytosis, and second messengers in signal transduction and its regulation are canonical concepts. Dynasore is a well-characterized pharmacological inhibitor of dynamin, and its use in such an experiment is standard practice.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem presents a clear, logical experimental design aimed at distinguishing between two well-defined, mutually exclusive (for the purpose of the primary mechanism) hypotheses.

There are no contradictions, missing information, or logical fallacies. The premises are factually correct within the domain of cell biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe core of the problem is to devise a logical test to differentiate between two mechanisms for signal desensitization: ($1$) receptor uncoupling at the cell surface and ($2$) physical removal of the receptor from the cell surface via endocytosis. The experiment leverages a specific inhibitor, dynasore, to achieve this separation.\n\nLet $S(t)$ represent the second messenger signal at time $t$, and let $R_{surf}(t)$ represent the abundance of receptors on the cell surface at time $t$. Under sustained agonist exposure, desensitization is observed, which means $S(t)$ decreases over time.\n\nThe two hypotheses can be formalized:\n1.  **Endocytosis-Dependent Desensitization:** The decrease in $S(t)$ is predominantly caused by the decrease in $R_{surf}(t)$. The process is: Agonist $\\rightarrow$ Endocytosis $\\uparrow$ $\\rightarrow$ $R_{surf}(t)$ $\\downarrow$ $\\rightarrow$ $S(t)$ $\\downarrow$. This pathway is dependent on the function of dynamin.\n2.  **Endocytosis-Independent Desensitization (Surface Uncoupling):** The decrease in $S(t)$ is due to receptors becoming unable to signal despite remaining on the surface. The process is: Agonist $\\rightarrow$ Receptor Phosphorylation $\\rightarrow$ β-arrestin Binding $\\rightarrow$ G protein uncoupling $\\rightarrow$ $S(t)$ $\\downarrow$. This pathway is independent of dynamin and endocytosis. $R_{surf}(t)$ may or may not decrease concurrently, but its decrease is not the primary cause of the signal loss.\n\nThe experiment uses dynasore to inhibit dynamin. Therefore, the primary effect of dynasore is to block endocytosis.\nLet's predict the outcome for each hypothesis when dynasore is applied.\n\n- **If desensitization is endocytosis-dependent:**\n  - Inhibiting dynamin with dynasore will block endocytosis.\n  - Therefore, $R_{surf}(t)$ will not decrease (or decrease much less).\n  - Since the signal $S(t)$ is dependent on $R_{surf}(t)$, preserving surface receptors will preserve the signal.\n  - **Prediction:** Dynasore treatment will prevent the decrease in both $R_{surf}(t)$ and $S(t)$.\n\n- **If desensitization is endocytosis-independent:**\n  - Inhibiting dynamin with dynasore will block endocytosis, so $R_{surf}(t)$ will be maintained on the surface.\n  - However, the desensitization mechanism (β-arrestin-mediated uncoupling) does not require endocytosis. It will proceed unabated.\n  - Therefore, even though $R_{surf}(t)$ remains high, $S(t)$ will still decrease.\n  - **Prediction:** Dynasore treatment will prevent the decrease in $R_{surf}(t)$ but will *not* prevent the decrease in $S(t)$.\n\nThe question asks for the outcome that demonstrates desensitization *does not require* endocytosis. This corresponds to the second prediction: a dissociation between the receptor surface level and the signaling output. The signal is lost even when the receptors are pharmacologically trapped on the cell surface.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Dynasore prevents detectable receptor internalization by the surface assay, yet the time-dependent decline in the second messenger signal persists with similar kinetics and magnitude as in control.**\n- **Analysis:** This outcome matches our prediction for endocytosis-independent desensitization precisely.\n  - \"Dynasore prevents detectable receptor internalization\" confirms that the experimental manipulation (blocking endocytosis) was successful.\n  - \"the time-dependent decline in the second messenger signal persists\" demonstrates that signal loss occurs even in the absence of receptor internalization.\n  - This result is a direct demonstration that endocytosis is not necessary for the observed desensitization, and it is fully compatible with a mechanism like β-arrestin-mediated uncoupling at the plasma membrane.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Dynasore prevents detectable receptor internalization and largely preserves the second messenger signal over time.**\n- **Analysis:** This outcome matches our prediction for endocytosis-dependent desensitization. It shows that blocking internalization also blocks signal loss. This would prove that desensitization *does* require endocytosis, which is the opposite of the conclusion the question asks to support.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Dynasore accelerates the loss of the second messenger signal and increases receptor internalization, suggesting that dynamin activity restrains desensitization.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is logically and factually flawed. Dynasore is an *inhibitor* of dynamin. Inhibiting dynamin *prevents* clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, dynasore should *prevent* or *reduce* receptor internalization, not increase it. This option describes an effect that is the opposite of the known function of the drug.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Dynasore has no effect on receptor internalization by the surface assay but rescues the second messenger signal, suggesting endocytosis-independent desensitization.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement contains multiple logical flaws.\n  - If dynasore has \"no effect on receptor internalization\", it implies the drug is ineffective or that this receptor's endocytosis is dynamin-independent. In either case, the experimental tool is not working as intended to test the hypothesis about dynamin-dependent endocytosis.\n  - If the signal is \"rescued\" (i.e., desensitization is prevented) by a drug that is not affecting internalization, it points to an off-target effect of dynasore, confounding any interpretation. There is no basis to link this outcome to endocytosis-independent desensitization. In fact, if desensitization were independent of endocytosis, a molecule targeting endocytosis should not rescue the signal.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2746740"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative models provide an essential framework, a quantitative understanding requires translating our biological knowledge into the language of mathematics.

The states are: resting receptor ($R$), active receptor ($R^\\*$), phosphorylated receptor ($R_p$), arrestin-bound receptor ($RA$), and internalized receptor ($I$).\n\nThe kinetic scheme is described by the following transitions:\n$R \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{\\mathrm{off}}]{k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0} R^\\* \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}} R_p \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{\\mathrm{unarr}}]{k_{\\mathrm{arr}}} RA \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{int}}} I$\nAdditionally, there are feedback and degradation pathways:\n$R_p \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{dephos}}} R$\n$I \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} R$\n$I \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}} \\varnothing$ (degradation)\n\nThe agonist concentration $A$ is assumed to be constant at a value $A_0$, making the activation step $R \\rightarrow R^\\*$ a pseudo-first-order reaction with rate constant $k_{\\text{eff}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0$.\n\nFrom the law of mass action, the rate of change for the concentration of each species is the sum of the rates of all reactions producing it (influx) minus the sum of the rates of all reactions consuming it (outflux). This yields the following system of $5$ coupled linear first-order ODEs.\n\n$1$. Rate of change for resting receptor, $R(t)$:\n$R$ is produced by deactivation of $R^\\*$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}} R^\\*$), dephosphorylation of $R_p$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{dephos}} R_p$), and recycling of $I$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{rec}} I$). It is consumed by activation to $R^\\*$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0 R$). By problem statement, synthesis is absent ($k_{\\mathrm{syn}} = 0$).\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{off}} R^\\* + k_{\\mathrm{dephos}} R_p + k_{\\mathrm{rec}} I - k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0 R\n$$\n\n$2$. Rate of change for active receptor, $R^\\*(t)$:\n$R^\\*$ is produced by activation of $R$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0 R$). It is consumed by deactivation to $R$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}} R^\\*$) and phosphorylation to $R_p$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{phos}} R^\\*$).\n$$\n\\frac{dR^\\*}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} A_0 R - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{phos}}) R^\\*\n$$\n\n$3$. Rate of change for phosphorylated receptor, $R_p(t)$:\n$R_p$ is produced by phosphorylation of $R^\\*$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{phos}} R^\\*$) and unbinding of arrestin from $RA$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{unarr}} RA$). It is consumed by dephosphorylation to $R$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{dephos}} R_p$) and arrestin binding to form $RA$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{arr}} R_p$).\n$$\n\\frac{dR_p}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{phos}} R^\\* + k_{\\mathrm{unarr}} RA - (k_{\\mathrm{dephos}} + k_{\\mathrm{arr}}) R_p\n$$\n\n$4$. Rate of change for arrestin-bound receptor, $RA(t)$:\n$RA$ is produced by arrestin binding to $R_p$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{arr}} R_p$). It is consumed by arrestin unbinding to form $R_p$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{unarr}} RA$) and internalization into the endosomal compartment (rate $k_{\\mathrm{int}} RA$).\n$$\n\\frac{dRA}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{arr}} R_p - (k_{\\mathrm{unarr}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}) RA\n$$\n\n$5$. Rate of change for internalized receptor, $I(t)$:\n$I$ is produced by internalization of $RA$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{int}} RA$). It is consumed by recycling to $R$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{rec}} I$) and degradation (rate $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} I$).\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{int}} RA - (k_{\\mathrm{rec}} + k_{\\mathrm{deg}}) I\n$$\n\nThis system of ODEs, along with the initial conditions $R(0) = R_0$ and $R^\\*(0) = R_p(0) = RA(0) = I(0) = 0$, defines an initial value problem (IVP). We can confirm the internal consistency of the model by examining the rate of change of the total receptor population, $R_{total}(t) = R(t) + R^\\*(t) + R_p(t) + RA(t) + I(t)$. Summing all $5$ ODEs, we observe that all internal flux terms cancel out, leaving only the degradation term:\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{total}}{dt} = \\frac{dR}{dt} + \\frac{dR^\\*}{dt} + \\frac{dR_p}{dt} + \\frac{dRA}{dt} + \\frac{dI}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{deg}} I\n$$\nThis confirms that the total number of receptors is conserved except for the loss due to degradation from the internalized pool, as expected.\n\nTo solve this IVP numerically for the given parameter sets, we will use a standard numerical integration method. A robust choice is the `solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library in Python, which implements several adaptive-stepsize algorithms suitable for such systems. We will define a function that computes the vector of derivatives for a given state vector $y = [R, R^\\*, R_p, RA, I]$ and integrate from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\mathrm{end}}$ for each test case. The final metric $f = I(T_{\\mathrm{end}}) / R_0$ is then computed from the integration result.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives, solves, and analyzes a kinetic model of receptor regulation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains:\n    # A0, kon, koff, kphos, kdephos, karr, kunarr, kint, krec, kdeg, T_end\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (happy path)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.3, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.005, 200.0),\n        # Case 2 (boundary, no agonist)\n        (0.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.3, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.005, 200.0),\n        # Case 3 (fast desensitization/internalization, slow recycling, high degradation)\n        (10.0, 1.0, 0.1, 1.0, 0.05, 1.0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.005, 0.02, 300.0),\n        # Case 4 (no arrestin binding, internalization disabled)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.005, 200.0),\n        # Case 5 (high dephosphorylation counteracts desensitization)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 2.0, 0.3, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.005, 200.0),\n    ]\n\n    R0 = 1.0  # Initial total receptor concentration in uM\n\n    def model(t, y, params):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the system of ordinary differential equations for receptor dynamics.\n        \n        Args:\n            t (float): Time.\n            y (list): State vector [R, R*, R_p, RA, I].\n            params (tuple): Kinetic parameters.\n            \n        Returns:\n            list: The derivatives [dR/dt, dR*/dt, dR_p/dt, dRA/dt, dI/dt].\n        \"\"\"\n        R, R_star, R_p, RA, I = y\n        A0, kon, koff, kphos, kdephos, karr, kunarr, kint, krec, kdeg = params\n\n        # Effective first-order activation rate\n        k_eff_on = kon * A0\n\n        # Rate equations\n        dR_dt = koff * R_star + kdephos * R_p + krec * I - k_eff_on * R\n        dR_star_dt = k_eff_on * R - (koff + kphos) * R_star\n        dR_p_dt = kphos * R_star + kunarr * RA - (kdephos + karr) * R_p\n        dRA_dt = karr * R_p - (kunarr + kint) * RA\n        dI_dt = kint * RA - (krec + kdeg) * I\n        \n        return [dR_dt, dR_star_dt, dR_p_dt, dRA_dt, dI_dt]\n\n    results = []\n    for i, case_params in enumerate(test_cases):\n        # Unpack parameters for the current case\n        A0, kon, koff, kphos, kdephos, karr, kunarr, kint, krec, kdeg, T_end = case_params\n        params_tuple = (A0, kon, koff, kphos, kdephos, karr, kunarr, kint, krec, kdeg)\n\n        # Initial conditions: R(0) = R0, all other states are 0\n        y0 = [R0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n        \n        # Time span for integration\n        t_span = (0, T_end)\n        \n        # We only need the solution at the final time T_end for efficiency\n        t_eval = [T_end]\n\n        # Numerically integrate the ODE system\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=model,\n            t_span=t_span,\n            y0=y0,\n            args=(params_tuple,),\n            t_eval=t_eval,\n            method='RK45',  # Standard Runge-Kutta method\n            dense_output=False\n        )\n        \n        # Extract the final concentration of the internalized receptor\n        I_final = sol.y[4, -1]\n        \n        # Calculate the metric f = I(T_end) / R0\n        f_metric = I_final / R0\n        \n        # Format to 6 decimal places and store the result\n        results.append(f\"{f_metric:.6f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2746776"}]}
