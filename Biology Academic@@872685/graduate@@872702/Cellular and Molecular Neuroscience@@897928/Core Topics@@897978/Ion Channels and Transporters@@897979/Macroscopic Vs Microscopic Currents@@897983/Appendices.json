It is a standard problem in the biophysics of ion channels, based on the fundamental principles of stochastic processes. I will therefore proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the basic properties of a time-homogeneous Markov process. The defining characteristic of such a process is its memorylessness: the probability of a state transition in any infinitesimal time interval $dt$ is constant and independent of the time the system has already spent in the current state.\n\n**1. Derivation of Dwell Time Probability Density Functions**\n\nLet us first consider a channel in the open state, $O$. The constant transition rate to the closed state, $C$, is given as $k_{OC}$. The probability of the channel closing in any infinitesimally small time interval $dt$ is $k_{OC} dt$.\n\nLet $S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$ be the survival probability, defined as the probability that a channel that entered the open state at time $t=0$ is still open at a later time $t$. For the channel to be open at time $t+dt$, it must have been open at time $t$ and must not have closed in the interval $[t, t+dt]$. The probability of not closing in this interval is $(1 - k_{OC} dt)$.\n\nThus, we can write:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t+dt) = S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) (1 - k_{OC} dt) $$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t+dt) - S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)}{dt} = -k_{OC} S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) $$\nTaking the limit as $dt \\rightarrow 0$, we obtain the differential equation for the survival probability:\n$$ \\frac{dS_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)}{dt} = -k_{OC} S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) $$\nThe initial condition is $S_{\\mathrm{O}}(0) = 1$, as the channel is certainly open at the moment it enters the open state. The solution to this first-order linear ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) = \\exp(-k_{OC} t) $$\nThe probability density function, $f_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$, for the duration of an open event is the probability per unit time that the event terminates at time $t$. This is the product of the probability of surviving until time $t$, $S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$, and the instantaneous rate of closing, $k_{OC}$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) = k_{OC} S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$, we find the functional form of the probability density for the open time duration:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) = k_{OC} \\exp(-k_{OC} t) $$\nThis is an exponential distribution.\n\nBy identical reasoning, we can derive the probability density function for the closed time duration, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}(t)$. The rate of transition from the closed state, $C$, to the open state, $O$, is $k_{CO}$. The survival probability in the closed state, $S_{\\mathrm{C}}(t)$, is governed by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dS_{\\mathrm{C}}(t)}{dt} = -k_{CO} S_{\\mathrm{C}}(t) $$\nWith the initial condition $S_{\\mathrm{C}}(0) = 1$, the solution is:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{C}}(t) = \\exp(-k_{CO} t) $$\nThe corresponding probability density function for the closed time duration is:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{C}}(t) = k_{CO} S_{\\mathrm{C}}(t) = k_{CO} \\exp(-k_{CO} t) $$\n\n**2. Computation of Mean Open and Closed Times**\n\nThe mean open time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{o}}$, is the expectation value of the open time duration, which is calculated by integrating $t$ over its probability density function $f_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t f_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\, k_{OC} \\exp(-k_{OC} t) dt $$\nWe solve this integral using integration by parts, $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$. Let $u = t$ and $dv = k_{OC} \\exp(-k_{OC} t) dt$. Then $du = dt$ and $v = -\\exp(-k_{OC} t)$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\left[ -t \\exp(-k_{OC} t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (-\\exp(-k_{OC} t)) dt $$\nThe first term evaluates to $0$ at both limits: $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} -t \\exp(-k_{OC} t) = 0$ for $k_{OC}  0$, and at $t=0$, the term is $0$. We are left with the integral:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-k_{OC} t) dt = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k_{OC}} \\exp(-k_{OC} t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{o}} = (0) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{k_{OC}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k_{OC}} $$\nThe mean open time is the reciprocal of the rate constant for leaving the open state.\n\nAnalogously, the mean closed time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{c}}$, is the expectation value of the closed time duration:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t f_{\\mathrm{C}}(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\, k_{CO} \\exp(-k_{CO} t) dt $$\nThe calculation is identical in form to the one for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{o}}$, with $k_{OC}$ replaced by $k_{CO}$. The result is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{1}{k_{CO}} $$\n\n**3. Macroscopic Current Relaxation**\n\nThe macroscopic current $I(t)$ is proportional to the probability that a channel is open, $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$. To understand its relaxation, we must analyze the dynamics of $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$ using the master equation. The rate of change of $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$ is the difference between the flux of channels entering the open state and the flux of channels leaving it.\n$$ \\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)}{dt} = (\\text{rate of } C \\to O) - (\\text{rate of } O \\to C) $$\nThe rate of $C \\to O$ transitions is the product of the probability of being in state $C$, $P_{\\mathrm{C}}(t)$, and the rate constant $k_{CO}$. The rate of $O \\to C$ transitions is $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) k_{OC}$.\n$$ \\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)}{dt} = P_{\\mathrm{C}}(t) k_{CO} - P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) k_{OC} $$\nSince a channel must be in either the closed or open state, we have $P_{\\mathrm{C}}(t) + P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) = 1$, which implies $P_{\\mathrm{C}}(t) = 1 - P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$. Substituting this into the master equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)}{dt} = (1 - P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)) k_{CO} - P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) k_{OC} $$\nRearranging this equation yields a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)}{dt} + (k_{CO} + k_{OC}) P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) = k_{CO} $$\nThe system relaxes towards a new steady state, $P_{\\mathrm{O,ss}}$, where $\\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dt} = 0$. This steady-state open probability is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{O,ss}} = \\frac{k_{CO}}{k_{CO} + k_{OC}} $$\nThe general solution to the differential equation is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) = P_{\\mathrm{O,ss}} + \\left( P_{\\mathrm{O}}(0) - P_{\\mathrm{O,ss}} \\right) \\exp\\left(-(k_{CO} + k_{OC})t\\right) $$\nwhere $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(0)$ is the open probability at $t=0$, i.e., at the moment the voltage is changed. This equation describes an exponential relaxation from the initial probability $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(0)$ to the final steady-state probability $P_{\\mathrm{O,ss}}$.\nThe relaxation process is governed by the exponential term. The time constant of this relaxation, let us call it $\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}$, is the reciprocal of the coefficient of $t$ in the exponent:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}} = \\frac{1}{k_{CO} + k_{OC}} $$\nSince $I(t) = N i P_{\\mathrm{O}}(t)$, and $N$ and $i$ are constant under the voltage clamp, the macroscopic current $I(t)$ relaxes exponentially to its new steady-state value with the same time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}$. It is crucial to note that this macroscopic relaxation time constant is distinct from the mean dwell times $\\tau_{\\mathrm{o}}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{c}}$ derived earlier. It is related to them by $\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{c}}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{o}}}\\right)^{-1}$.\n\nThe final answer required is the ordered pair $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{o}},\\ \\tau_{\\mathrm{c}})$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{k_{OC}}  \\frac{1}{k_{CO}} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2721705"}, {"introduction": "With a theoretical foundation in place, we can now turn to the practical interpretation of experimental data.

The slope conductance is defined as the derivative of the current $I$ with respect to the voltage $V$:\n$$\ng_s = \\frac{dI}{dV}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of a symmetric two-point (central difference) approximation to estimate this derivative.

Rounding to three significant figures as requested, we obtain $g_s = 70.1\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n\nSecond, we address the origin of the non-linearity in the macroscopic current-voltage ($I$-$V$) relationship. The macroscopic current $I$ through an ensemble of $N$ identical channels is given by the product of the number of channels, the probability that a single channel is open ($P_o$), and the current flowing through a single open channel ($i$):\n$$\nI(V) = N \\cdot P_o(V) \\cdot i(V)\n$$\nThe problem states that the single-channel recordings show a linear current-voltage relation, consistent with an ohmic pore and a constant unitary conductance $\\gamma = 12\\,\\mathrm{pS}$. This means the single-channel current $i(V)$ follows Ohm's law and is given by:\n$$\ni(V) = \\gamma (V - E_K)\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is constant and does not depend on voltage. The absence of voltage dependence in $\\gamma$ signifies that there is no intrinsic pore rectification.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $i(V)$ into the equation for the macroscopic current $I(V)$:\n$$\nI(V) = N \\cdot P_o(V) \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot (V - E_K)\n$$\nIn this expression, $N$, $\\gamma$, and $E_K$ are constants. The driving force term $(V - E_K)$ is linear with respect to voltage $V$. The macroscopic $I$-$V$ data clearly show a strong non-linear relationship (e.g., the current increases more than $15$-fold for a $10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ depolarization from $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, while the driving force $(V-E_K)$ only increases from $40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). Since the single-channel current $i(V)$ is linear, the pronounced non-linearity of the macroscopic current $I(V)$ must originate from the voltage dependence of the open probability, $P_o(V)$. For these voltage-gated channels, $P_o$ increases steeply with depolarization, causing the total current to grow much more rapidly than the driving force alone would predict.\n\nTherefore, the observed deviation from linearity in the macroscopic $I$-$V$ relation arises from voltage-dependent gating, not from intrinsic pore rectification.

The zero-current crossing of the full steady-state $I\\!-\\!V$ in the presence of fast block remains at $V = E_{K}$ because $f(V)$ scales conductance but does not change the condition for $I=0$.

It does not alter the electrochemical potential difference that drives ion flow, and thus it does not change the reversal potential. The true reversal potential remains the Nernst potential for the permeant ion, $K^+$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Experimentalist's Procedure**\nThe experimentalist performs a linear fit on the macroscopic outward current, for $V \\in [V_1, V_2]$ with $V_1  E_K$.\nThe macroscopic current is $I(V) = G_{eff}(V) (V - E_K)$, where the effective conductance is $G_{eff}(V) = G_{\\max}f(V)$.\nBased on the Woodhull model for an intracellular cationic blocker, $f(V)$ is a decreasing function of $V$ for $V0$. Therefore, for $V  E_K$, the $I-V$ relationship is a product of a linearly increasing term $(V - E_K)$ and a decreasing term $f(V)$. The result is a non-linear curve. The slope of this curve, $\\frac{dI}{dV}$, decreases as $V$ increases, and can even become negative at large depolarizations. This means the $I-V$ curve for the outward limb is concave down (it bends towards the voltage axis).\nWhen a linear function is fitted (via least squares) to a segment of a concave-down curve, the resulting line will be shallower than the curve's initial tangent and will intersect the x-axis at a point to the right of the curve's true x-intercept. Therefore, the \"apparent reversal potential\" obtained by extrapolating this linear fit will be more positive (depolarized) than the true reversal potential, $E_K$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because $f(V)$ decreases with depolarization for intracellular cationic block, the outward limb $I(V)$ is downward-curved for $V  E_{K}$; therefore, a linear fit over $[V_{1},V_{2}]$ yields an apparent intercept that is more depolarized than $E_{K}$. The true $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ remains equal to the Nernst value and can be recovered by fitting $I(V)$ to $I(V) = G_{\\max}\\,\\frac{V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{\\mathrm{d}}(0)}\\exp\\!\\left(z_{\\mathrm{B}}\\,\\delta\\,\\frac{F V}{R T}\\right)}}$ with $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ as a fit parameter, or equivalently by dividing the measured $I(V)$ by $f(V)$ inferred from the Woodhull model to reconstruct the underlying linear $I\\!-\\!V$ and reading its zero crossing.**\nThis option presents a complete and correct analysis.\n1.  It correctly identifies that the outward limb is downward-curved (concave down).\n2.  It correctly deduces that the linear fit artifactually shifts the apparent reversal potential to a more depolarized value.\n3.  It correctly states that the true reversal potential is unchanged and equals the Nernst potential.\n4.  It proposes two principled and valid methods for recovering the true $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ based on the correct biophysical model: a direct non-linear fit to the model equation, and a linearization of the data using the model for the block.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The apparent reversal potential is more hyperpolarized than $E_{K}$ because inward current is reduced by rectification. The true $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ can be obtained by fitting only the inward limb linearly and taking its intercept.**\nThis option is incorrect.\n1.  The deviation is in the wrong direction. The apparent reversal potential is more depolarized, not hyperpolarized.\n2.  The reasoning is confused. \"Inward rectification\" means outward current is preferentially reduced, not inward current. The block is strongest for outward currents at depolarized potentials.\n3.  While fitting the inward limb might yield a reasonable estimate (as block is weaker at negative potentials), the premise of the option is fundamentally flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The zero-current crossing of the full steady-state $I\\!-\\!V$ in the presence of fast block remains at $V = E_{K}$ because $f(V)$ scales conductance but does not change the condition for $I=0$. Thus, any apparent shift arises from linear extrapolation over a nonlinear outward limb. The true $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ can be extracted without removing the blocker by using instantaneous tail-current reversal: from a voltage that relieves block, step to a series of test voltages and determine the test voltage at which the initial (sub-millisecond) tail current changes sign; alternatively, vary $[B]$ and extrapolate the fitted $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ to $[B] \\to 0$.**\nThis option presents an alternative, but equally correct and fundamental, analysis.\n1.  It provides the correct biophysical reason why the true reversal potential is unchanged: the blocker scales conductance without affecting the driving force.\n2.  It correctly identifies the flawed extrapolation as the source of the apparent shift.\n3.  It proposes two standard, powerful, and principled *experimental* methods to determine $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ that circumvent the issue of voltage-dependent block: instantaneous tail-current analysis and extrapolation to zero blocker concentration. Both methods are mainstays of rigorous electrophysiological practice.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Voltage-dependent block genuinely shifts $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ because the blocker contributes an electrogenic step to permeation; the shift is $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}' = E_{K} + \\frac{R T}{F}\\ln\\!\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{\\mathrm{d}}(V)}\\right)$. Therefore, the outward-limb intercept estimated by linear fit gives the correct $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}'$ in the presence of block.**\nThis option is fundamentally incorrect.\n1.  It falsely claims that an occluding blocker shifts the reversal potential. This contradicts the basic model where the blocker modulates conductance, not the ionic driving force.\n2.  The provided formula for the shifted reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}'$ is nonsensical, as it defines the \"reversal potential\" as a function of the membrane voltage $V$ itself.\n3.  It incorrectly legitimizes a flawed data analysis procedure (linear fit of a non-linear curve).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBoth options A and C provide correct characterizations of the deviation and propose valid, principled methods for recovering the true reversal potential. Option A focuses on mathematical analysis of the measured curve, while Option C focuses on alternative experimental designs to measure the reversal potential more directly.
