Local domain formation and buffer kinetics: When a VGCC opens, a steep, localized intracellular $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ microdomain forms within tens of nanometers of the pore on a submillisecond timescale. The ability of a cytosolic buffer to intercept this microdomain depends primarily on its association rate constant $k_{\\text{on}}$ relative to the rate of ion accumulation in the domain. BAPTA has a fast $k_{\\text{on}}$ (on the order of $10^{8}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$), while EGTA has a slower $k_{\\text{on}}$ (on the order of $10^{6}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$), despite broadly similar equilibrium affinities under physiological conditions. Consequently, BAPTA effectively clamps local $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ rises near the channel, whereas EGTA primarily buffers slower, more global $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ changes and is ineffective against microdomain peaks.\n\n2. Distinct inactivation mechanisms: Calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) is driven by local $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ binding to preassociated calmodulin (CaM) on the channel, while voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) depends on channel-intrinsic voltage sensor conformational changes and proceeds in the absence of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx. Barium ions ($\\text{Ba}^{2+}$) permeate VGCCs but do not effectively trigger CDI via CaM, so currents carried by $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ predominantly report VDI.\n\nThese principles imply the following predictions:\n\n- With external $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ as the charge carrier, CDI contributes a fast inactivation component because local $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ at the channel mouth rises rapidly. EGTA, with its slower $k_{\\text{on}}$, fails to significantly reduce the local microdomain and thus has little effect on CDI; $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$ remains fast and similar to the no-buffer case. In contrast, BAPTA, with a fast $k_{\\text{on}}$, suppresses the local rise in $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ near the channel and thereby suppresses CDI, leaving predominantly VDI; hence $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$ becomes slower (larger).\n\n- With external $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ as the charge carrier, CDI is largely absent regardless of buffer; inactivation predominantly reflects VDI. Therefore, $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$ should be slow and broadly similar whether the internal solution contains EGTA or BAPTA.\n\nA convenient kinetic framing is that the observed inactivation rate reflects contributions from parallel, approximately independent pathways:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{obs}}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{VDI}}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{CDI}}}.\n$$\nWith BAPTA under external $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, suppression of CDI corresponds to $\\tau_{\\text{CDI}} \\to \\infty$, hence $1/\\tau_{\\text{CDI}} \\to 0$ and $\\tau_{\\text{obs}} \\to \\tau_{\\text{VDI}}$, increasing the observed time constant.

The predictions correctly capture that EGTA leaves CDI largely intact (fast $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$ similar to no buffer), while BAPTA suppresses CDI (slow $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$ reflecting VDI), and that with $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$, $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$ is slow and similar regardless of the buffer. The stated ordering and example values are consistent with the principles. Verdict — Correct.\n\n- Option B: This asserts that EGTA, being a “stronger” buffer, eliminates CDI and thus yields the slowest $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$, whereas BAPTA leaves CDI intact. This inverts the critical kinetic distinction. Although EGTA has high affinity, its slower $k_{\\text{on}}$ cannot intercept the submillisecond microdomain, so it does not eliminate CDI. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: This claims BAPTA accelerates CDI (faster $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$) because it “speeds” $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ binding. In reality, BAPTA reduces local free $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ at the channel mouth and thereby suppresses CaM activation and CDI; it does not accelerate CDI. Furthermore, testing only with internal BAPTA and varying external ion can show the absence of CDI with $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$, but the prediction that $\\tau_{\\text{Ca,BAPTA}} \\ll \\tau_{\\text{Ba,BAPTA}}$ is opposite to expectation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: This states that inactivation is purely voltage-dependent with external $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and chelators do not alter $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$. That ignores CDI, which is robust for L-type channels with $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx. Suppressing CDI with BAPTA is expected to increase $\\tau_{\\text{inact}}$.
