It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and requires the derivation of a fundamental relationship from first principles.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the maximum gating charge, $Q_{max}$, displaced during the full activation of a single voltage-gated ion channel. The givens are the number of contributing basic residues, $n$; the elementary charge, $q$; and the effective fraction of the transmembrane electric field traversed by each charge, $\\delta$.\n\nThe gating current, $I_g(t)$, measured in an external circuit arises from the movement of charges within the transmembrane electric field. To a first approximation, the cell membrane can be modeled as a parallel-plate capacitor. From electrostatics, the movement of a point charge $q_i$ by a distance $\\Delta x_i$ perpendicular to the capacitor plates (of separation $d$) induces a charge flow, $\\Delta Q_i$, in the external circuit given by:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_i = q_i \\frac{\\Delta x_i}{d}\n$$\nThis induced charge is the quantity measured experimentally as gating charge.\n\nThe problem defines $\\delta$ as the \"effective fraction of the transmembrane electric field traversed\" by each charge. In the context of a constant electric field across the membrane, this is equivalent to the fraction of the membrane's physical thickness, $d$, that each charge effectively traverses. Thus, we can write the average displacement fraction for each charge as $\\frac{\\Delta x}{d} = \\delta$.\n\nThe voltage sensor contains $n$ basic residues, each carrying an elementary charge $+q$. We assume that upon a saturating depolarization, which causes the channel to move from its fully resting state to its fully activated state, all $n$ of these residues contribute to the gating charge.\n\nFor a single one of these residues, its contribution to the total measured gating charge, let us call it $Q_{i}$, is:\n$$\nQ_i = q \\cdot \\delta\n$$\nThis assumes that each contributing charge is monovalent (charge of $1q$) and traverses the same effective fraction $\\delta$ of the field.\n\nThe total gating charge, $Q_{max}$, is the sum of the contributions from all $n$ independent charges. Since a \"saturating\" step is applied to \"fully activate\" the sensor, we are measuring the charge movement corresponding to the complete conformational change. Therefore, we sum the contributions from all $n$ residues:\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q \\delta)\n$$\nAs $q$ and $\\delta$ are treated as constants for all contributing charges in this model, the summation simplifies to:\n$$\nQ_{max} = n \\delta q\n$$\nThis is the compact expression for the total gating charge displacement. The definition provided in the problem, $Q_{max} = \\int I_g(t) dt$, establishes the connection between this theoretical quantity and the experimentally measured value. This derivation directly links the microscopic charge movements to the macroscopic measurement.\n\nThis derivation relies on several minimal biophysical assumptions:\n$1$. The $n$ contributing S4 segment charges move independently of each other. Electrostatic interactions between the charges are neglected.\n$2$. Each of the $n$ charges is identical and carries a single elementary charge, $+q$.\n$3$. The movement of each charge during activation results in the same average effective displacement, characterized by the parameter $\\delta$.\n$4$. The gating process can be modeled as a two-state transition between a fully resting and a fully activated conformation, and the measurement captures the charge movement for this complete transition.\n$5$. The membrane acts as a simple capacitor with a uniform electric field, allowing the charge displacement to be linearly proportional to the fractional distance moved.\n\nRegarding the influence of auxiliary subunits: These are proteins that co-assemble with the main pore-forming subunit and modulate its function.\n-   Effect on $n$: The number of gating charges, $n$, is determined by the primary amino acid sequence of the S4 segment in the pore-forming subunit. It is a fixed, genetically encoded integer. Auxiliary subunits do not alter the primary structure of the pore-forming subunit and therefore are **not expected to change $n$**.\n-   Effect on $\\delta$: The effective displacement, $\\delta$, is a measure of the extent and geometry of the S4 segment's conformational change relative to the electric field. This physical movement occurs within a complex protein environment. Auxiliary subunits can bind to the voltage-sensing domains and alter their stability, structure, or the pathway of their conformational change. By modifying the protein landscape, an auxiliary subunit can change the start and end points of the S4 movement or its orientation, thereby **altering the value of $\\delta$**.

It describes a canonical model of voltage-gated ion channel function, where activation proceeds through a sequence of voltage-dependent conformational changes in the VSDs, which are then coupled to the opening of the pore. The concepts of gating charge ($Q$), gating current ($I_{\\mathrm{g}}$), conductance ($G$), and their voltage dependencies ($Q$–$V$ and $G$–$V$ curves) are central to the field of cellular electrophysiology and biophysics. The experimental paradigm described—using a point mutation to dissect the contributions of specific transitions to the overall gating process—is a standard and powerful technique. The problem is well-posed, as the effects of the specified mutation are qualitatively predictable within this established framework. The language is objective and employs standard terminology. The setup is self-contained and sufficient for a qualitative deduction. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full derivation of the solution will now be performed.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe activation of the voltage-gated channel can be represented by a sequential kinetic scheme. A simplified model consistent with the problem statement is a sequence of closed states leading to a final open state:\n$$\nC_1 \\leftrightarrow C_2 \\leftrightarrow \\dots \\leftrightarrow C_{\\mathrm{pre-open}} \\stackrel{K_{\\mathrm{final}}(V)}{\\longleftrightarrow} O\n$$\nHere, the transitions between early closed states ($C_1, C_2, \\dots$) represent the \"early VSD transitions,\" and the final transition from the last closed state ($C_{\\mathrm{pre-open}}$) to the open state ($O$) represents the \"last VSD transition\" which is coupled to pore opening. Each transition is voltage-dependent, driven by the movement of gating charges.\n\n1.  **Effect on the Conductance–Voltage ($G$–$V$) Curve:**\n    The macroscopic conductance $G(V)$ is directly proportional to the steady-state open probability, $G(V) \\propto P_{\\mathrm{o}}(V)$. The population of the open state $O$ depends on all preceding equilibria, but it is critically dependent on the final opening step, $C_{\\mathrm{pre-open}} \\leftrightarrow O$. The problem states that the mutation shifts *only* this last transition to more depolarized voltages. This means the equilibrium constant for this step, $K_{\\mathrm{final}}(V)$, is decreased at any given voltage $V$, making it more difficult for the channel to open. To achieve the same open probability $P_{\\mathrm{o}}$ as the wild-type channel, a significantly more depolarized membrane voltage is required. Consequently, the entire $G$–$V$ curve, which plots $G(V)$ versus $V$, will undergo a substantial shift to the right, towards more depolarized potentials.\n\n2.  **Effect on the Charge–Voltage ($Q$–$V$) Curve:**\n    The total gating charge $Q(V)$ at steady state is the voltage-dependent sum of charges moved across all transitions. Let $q_{\\mathrm{early}}$ be the total charge moved during the early transitions ($C_1 \\leftrightarrow \\dots \\leftrightarrow C_{\\mathrm{pre-open}}$) and $q_{\\mathrm{final}}$ be the charge moved during the final transition ($C_{\\mathrm{pre-open}} \\leftrightarrow O$). The total charge at a given voltage $V$ is a weighted average reflecting the population of states.\n    $$\n    Q(V) = Q_{\\mathrm{early}}(V) + q_{\\mathrm{final}} \\cdot P(\\text{states after final transition}, V)\n    $$\n    The problem states that the early VSD transitions are unaltered. This means the voltage dependence of the movement of $q_{\\mathrm{early}}$ is unchanged. Only the final charge movement, $q_{\\mathrm{final}}$, associated with the last transition, is shifted to more depolarized potentials. Since the $Q$–$V$ curve reflects the cumulative charge from *all* transitions, and since a significant fraction of the charge ($q_{\\mathrm{early}}$) moves during the unaffected early steps, the overall $Q$–$V$ curve will shift much less than the $G$–$V$ curve. The shift in the $Q$–$V$ curve is a weighted average of the shifts of all charge-moving components; because only the last component is shifted, the overall shift will be minor.\n\n3.  **Relative Separation of $Q$–$V$ and $G$–$V$ Curves:**\n    The $G$–$V$ curve shifts significantly to more depolarized potentials, while the $Q$–$V$ curve shifts only slightly in the same direction. Therefore, the separation between the midpoints of the two curves on the voltage axis will increase. The $G$–$V$ curve will lie further to the right of the $Q$–$V$ curve in the mutant channel compared to the wild-type.\n\n4.  **Effect on the Gating Current ($I_{\\mathrm{g}}$):**\n    The gating current $I_{\\mathrm{g}}(t,V) = dQ(t,V)/dt$ measures the rate of charge movement. Its time course reflects the kinetics of the underlying conformational transitions. In the wild-type channel, if the transitions are kinetically similar, $I_{\\mathrm{g}}$ may decay approximately monophasically. If one step is slower than the others, multi-phasic decay is observed. The mutation \"selectively stabilizes the pre-open VSD conformation,\" which implies that the forward rate constant of the final transition is reduced, making this step kinetically slower and energetically less favorable at a given $V$. The early transitions remain kinetically unaltered.\n    Upon a depolarizing voltage step, the population will rapidly move through the early states, corresponding to the movement of $q_{\\mathrm{early}}$. This gives rise to a fast initial component of the gating current. The population then accumulates in the $C_{\\mathrm{pre-open}}$ state before slowly transitioning to the open state, corresponding to the movement of $q_{\\mathrm{final}}$. This creates a second, slower component in the gating current. This kinetic separation between the fast early charge movement and the slow late charge movement will cause the gating current to exhibit a more pronounced \"shoulder\" or a distinct slow phase in its decay. This slow component, representing the difficult final opening step, will be most apparent at the more depolarized voltages required to drive this transition at a measurable rate.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. $G$–$V$ shifts to more depolarized $V$ with little change in $Q$–$V$, increasing their separation; the gating current develops a more pronounced late shoulder reflecting a separated slow charge component at higher $V$.**\n    This statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. The $G$–$V$ curve shifts rightward significantly more than the $Q$–$V$ curve, increasing their separation. Slowing the kinetics of the final transition relative to the unchanged early ones will create a more prominent slow component (late shoulder) in the gating current.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $Q$–$V$ and $G$–$V$ both shift equally to more depolarized $V$, leaving their separation unchanged; the gating current shoulder is diminished because late charge merges with early components.**\n    This is incorrect. The shifts are not equal; the $G$–$V$ shift is much larger. Therefore, the separation does not remain unchanged. The gating current shoulder is enhanced, not diminished, because the kinetics of the late and early charge movements become more separated, not merged.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. $Q$–$V$ shifts more than $G$–$V$, decreasing their separation; the gating current becomes more monophasic with the shoulder disappearing.**\n    This is incorrect. The $G$–$V$ curve shifts more than the $Q$–$V$ curve, increasing their separation. The gating current becomes more complex (bi- or multi-phasic), not more monophasic, due to the introduced kinetic bottleneck.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. $G$–$V$ shifts to more hyperpolarized $V$ while $Q$–$V$ is unchanged, reversing their usual order; the gating current acquires a new early shoulder at less depolarized $V$.**\n    This is incorrect. Stabilizing a pre-open state makes opening more difficult, requiring *depolarization*, not hyperpolarization. The shift is to the right, not the left. The affected kinetic component is the *last* step, so any prominent feature would be a *late* shoulder, not an early one. Reversing the order of the $Q$–$V$ and $G$–$V$ curves is physically inconsistent with the model.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2731445"}]}
