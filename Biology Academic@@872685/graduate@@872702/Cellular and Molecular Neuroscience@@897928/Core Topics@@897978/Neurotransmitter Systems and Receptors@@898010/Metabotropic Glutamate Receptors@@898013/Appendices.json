This chimeric receptor is engineered by fusing the extracellular Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD) of mGluR2 with the Transmembrane Domains (TMD) and the intracellular C-terminal Domain (CTD) of mGluR1. The cell line is then treated with a selective agonist known to specifically activate Group II mGluRs (the group to which mGluR2 belongs).\n\nFor context, mGluRs are G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with distinct signaling pathways based on their subtype. Group II mGluRs (mGluR2, mGluR3) normally couple to $G_{i/o}$ proteins, leading to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Group I mGluRs (mGluR1, mGluR5) normally couple to $G_q$ proteins, leading to activation of Phospholipase C (PLC).\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and primary intracellular signaling event that will occur in the cells expressing this chimeric receptor upon application of the selective Group II mGluR agonist?\n\nA. Activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nB. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nC. Activation of Phospholipase C (PLC), leading to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\mathrm{IP}_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nD. Direct gating of an associated cation-selective ion channel, leading to membrane depolarization.\n\nE. No significant change in intracellular second messenger levels, as the agonist-receptor domain pairing is non-functional.", "solution": "We apply the general principles of G-protein coupled receptor function. For class C GPCRs such as mGluRs, ligand specificity is primarily determined by the extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD), while G protein coupling specificity is determined by the transmembrane domains (TMDs), intracellular loops, and C-terminal domain (CTD).\n\nStep 1: Ligand recognition. The chimeric receptor contains the LBD of mGluR2. Therefore, a selective Group II mGluR agonist will bind and activate the receptor, because the agonist recognition is dictated by the mGluR2-derived LBD.\n\nStep 2: G protein coupling specificity. The intracellular signaling pathway engaged upon activation is determined by the TMDs and CTD, which in this chimera are derived from mGluR1 (a Group I mGluR). Group I mGluRs characteristically couple to $G_{q}$ proteins, not to $G_{i/o}$.\n\nStep 3: Immediate signaling cascade. Activation of $G_{q}$ leads to activation of Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyzes membrane $\\mathrm{PIP}_2$ into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\mathrm{IP}_3$) and diacylglycerol ($\\mathrm{DAG}$), i.e.,\n$$G_{q} \\Rightarrow \\text{PLC activation} \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{PIP}_2 \\to \\mathrm{IP}_3 + \\mathrm{DAG}.$$\nThus, the most immediate and primary intracellular event is PLC activation with production of $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ and $\\mathrm{DAG}$.\n\nStep 4: Exclusion of alternatives. Options A and B involve modulation of adenylyl cyclase via $G_{s}$ or $G_{i/o}$; however, the intracellular domains are from mGluR1, which preferentially couples to $G_{q}$, not $G_{i/o}$. Option D describes ionotropic channel gating, which is not a mechanism of GPCRs. Option E is not expected because the LBD-agonist pairing is functional, and downstream signaling machinery is present in the cell line.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is activation of PLC with generation of $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ and $\\mathrm{DAG}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342484"}, {"introduction": "Having established the principles of mGluR signaling, we now apply them to a classic neurophysiological context. A key skill for a neuroscientist is to deduce the site of synaptic modulation—whether it is presynaptic or postsynaptic. This problem challenges you to predict how activating presynaptic Group III mGluRs affects spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), forcing a distinction between changes in neurotransmitter release frequency and postsynaptic receptor response [@problem_id:2342483].", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is investigating synaptic transmission in a high-density primary culture of cortical neurons. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, they record postsynaptic currents from a pyramidal neuron. To isolate miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which result from the spontaneous release of single vesicles of glutamate, the bath solution contains tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block action potentials and picrotoxin to block GABA-A receptor-mediated inhibitory currents.\n\nAfter establishing a stable baseline recording of mEPSCs, the researcher bath-applies L-2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4), a selective agonist for Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Group III mGluRs are known to be coupled to $G_{i/o}$-family G-proteins and are predominantly expressed on presynaptic terminals.\n\nBased on the canonical signaling pathway of these receptors, what are the predicted effects of L-AP4 application on the frequency and amplitude of the mEPSCs recorded from the pyramidal neuron?\n\nA. mEPSC frequency will increase, and mEPSC amplitude will increase.\n\nB. mEPSC frequency will decrease, and mEPSC amplitude will decrease.\n\nC. mEPSC frequency will decrease, and mEPSC amplitude will show no change.\n\nD. mEPSC frequency will show no change, and mEPSC amplitude will decrease.\n\nE. mEPSC frequency will increase, and mEPSC amplitude will show no change.", "solution": "The experimental configuration isolates miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs): tetrodotoxin blocks action potentials, so events are spontaneous, and picrotoxin blocks GABA-A receptors, so recorded events are glutamatergic. Thus, the recorded mEPSCs reflect quantal release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals onto postsynaptic AMPA-type receptors.\n\nL-AP4 is a selective agonist of Group III mGluRs, which are predominantly presynaptic and coupled to $G_{i/o}$ G-proteins. The canonical $G_{i/o}$ signaling produces:\n- Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase: $G_{i/o} \\to \\downarrow AC \\to \\downarrow cAMP \\to \\downarrow PKA$-dependent phosphorylation of release machinery.\n- Modulation via $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ subunits: inhibition of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and activation of GIRK channels, leading to reduced presynaptic calcium entry and hyperpolarization of the terminal.\n\nSynaptic vesicle fusion probability depends on presynaptic calcium. Denote the release probability by $P_{r}$ and the number of functional release sites by $N$. The rate (frequency) of spontaneous vesicle fusion events scales as\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}} \\propto N P_{r}.\n$$\nBecause L-AP4 via $G_{i/o}$ signaling reduces presynaptic calcium influx and cAMP/PKA signaling, it decreases $P_{r}$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}}  0.\n$$\n\nThe mEPSC amplitude reflects the quantal size and postsynaptic receptor responsiveness, not the presynaptic release probability. A standard representation of the peak mEPSC amplitude is\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}} \\propto q \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{post}}.\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the quantal size (vesicular glutamate content and cleft glutamate transient) and $R_{\\mathrm{post}}$ summarizes postsynaptic AMPA receptor number/conductance and the driving force.

You will predict how activating mGluR2 alters not just the amplitude of synaptic currents but also their short-term dynamics, as measured by the paired-pulse ratio, and their statistical properties, measured by the coefficient of variation. Furthermore, the use of pertussis toxin (PTX) tests your detailed knowledge of the $G_{i/o}$ signaling pathway and its critical role in mediating mGluR-dependent synaptic depression [@problem_id:2724915].", "problem": "You are performing paired whole-cell recordings between a presynaptic cortical pyramidal neuron and a postsynaptic interneuron in an acute brain slice. You evoke two action potentials in the presynaptic neuron separated by $\\Delta t = 50$ ms to measure the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), defined as $\\mathrm{PPR} = A_2/A_1$, where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the mean amplitudes of the first and second excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), respectively. At baseline, you measure $A_1 = 200$ pA and $A_2 = 240$ pA, giving $\\mathrm{PPR} = 1.2$.

In a separate series of experiments, slices are preincubated for $T = 16$ h with pertussis toxin (PTX) at $500$ ng/mL, which catalyzes adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation of inhibitory heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) $\\alpha$ subunits of the $G_{i/o}$ family and thereby prevents receptor coupling to $G_{i/o}$.\n\nUsing the following foundational facts as your starting point, predict the pattern of changes you should observe with mGluR2 activation and how PTX pretreatment alters those changes.\n\nFoundational facts:\n- mGluR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that couples to $G_{i/o}$, whose activation reduces adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and $3',5'$-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), decreases protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, and via $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ inhibits presynaptic voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels ($Ca_V$), thereby lowering presynaptic release probability $p$ without directly changing quantal size $q$ or the number of readily releasable vesicles $N$ over short timescales.\n- In a simple quantal (binomial) model of synaptic transmission, the mean EPSC is $\\mu = N p q$, and, when quantal variance is negligible on the relevant timescale, the variance is $\\sigma^2 \\approx N p (1-p) q^2$, so that $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\sigma^2/\\mu^2 \\approx (1-p)/(N p)$.\n- If a manipulation reduces $p$ with $N$ and $q$ unchanged, then $\\mu$ decreases, $\\mathrm{PPR}$ typically increases, failure rate increases, and $\\mathrm{CV}$ increases (equivalently, $\\mathrm{CV}^{-2}$ decreases) in a manner correlated with the decrease in $\\mu$.\n\nWhich option best matches the expected empirical pattern under mGluR2 agonist application and its sensitivity to PTX pretreatment?\n\nA. With agonist: $A_1$ decreases to $120$ pA (approximately $40\\%$ reduction), $A_2$ decreases to $192$ pA so that $\\mathrm{PPR}$ increases to $1.6$, failure rate rises to $0.25$, and $\\mathrm{CV}$ increases to $0.40$.

With agonist: $A_1$ decreases to $120$ pA, but $A_2$ decreases more to $108$ pA, so $\\mathrm{PPR}$ decreases to $0.9$, failure rate falls to $0.01$, and $\\mathrm{CV}$ decreases to $0.15$.

With agonist: mean EPSCs are unchanged, but mEPSC amplitude decreases by approximately $40\\%$ with no change in mEPSC frequency; $\\mathrm{PPR}$ and $\\mathrm{CV}$ are unchanged.

With PTX pretreatment: the agonist still decreases $A_1$ and increases $\\mathrm{PPR}$ because $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$-mediated inhibition of $Ca_V$ channels is insensitive to PTX.", "solution": "We begin from the foundational mechanistic principles of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype $2$ (mGluR2) signaling. Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype $2$ is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that couples to inhibitory G-proteins $G_{i/o}$. Upon activation by agonist, the receptor catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on the $G_{i/o}$ heterotrimer, allowing $G_{\\alpha i/o}$ and $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ to signal. Two presynaptic consequences follow that reduce release probability $p$: (i) $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ directly inhibits presynaptic $Ca_V$ channels, reducing presynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry that gates vesicle fusion; (ii) $G_{\\alpha i}$ inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC), lowering $3',5'$-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, which typically supports a higher release probability and readily releasable pool priming state. These mechanisms decrease $p$ on the short timescale, without directly changing the number of release sites $N$ or the postsynaptic quantal size $q$.\n\nPertussis toxin (PTX) catalyzes adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation of $G_{\\alpha i/o}$ at a critical cysteine near the carboxyl terminus, preventing productive coupling of $G_{i/o}$ to GPCRs. As a result, agonist-bound mGluR2 cannot activate $G_{i/o}$, which eliminates both $G_{\\alpha i}$ and $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ signaling from this receptor.\n\nWe now formalize the expected changes using the quantal (binomial) model of synaptic transmission. The mean EPSC amplitude is\n$$\n\\mu = N p q,\n$$\nand, neglecting quantal variance on the timescale of these experiments, the variance is approximately\n$$\n\\sigma^2 \\approx N p (1-p) q^2.\n$$\nThus, the coefficient of variation satisfies\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2} \\approx \\frac{1-p}{N p}.\n$$\nUnder a pure presynaptic decrease in $p$ with $N$ and $q$ unchanged:\n- $\\mu$ decreases because it is proportional to $p$.\n- $\\mathrm{CV}^2$ increases (equivalently, $\\mathrm{CV}$ increases and $\\mathrm{CV}^{-2}$ decreases), because the numerator $1-p$ increases and the denominator $N p$ decreases.\n- The failure rate increases, because lower $p$ reduces the chance that any vesicle is released during a stimulus.\n- The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) increases, because the first pulse is more strongly affected by a decrease in $p$ than the second, and residual presynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can partially offset the lowered $p$ on the second pulse, increasing $A_2/A_1$.\n- Miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency decreases (fewer spontaneous release events as $p$ falls), whereas mEPSC amplitude, a proxy for quantal size $q$, remains unchanged if postsynaptic receptors and vesicular glutamate content are not affected on this timescale.\n\nWith PTX pretreatment, mGluR2 cannot couple to $G_{i/o}$; therefore, neither $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$-mediated $Ca_V$ inhibition nor $G_{\\alpha i}$-mediated AC inhibition occurs. Consequently, the agonist should produce no effect on $p$ and thus no change in $\\mu$, $\\mathrm{PPR}$, failure rate, or $\\mathrm{CV}$. Likewise, mEPSC frequency and amplitude should remain at baseline.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these predictions:\n\nOption A: With agonist, $A_1$ decreases from $200$ pA to $120$ pA (approximately $40\\%$ reduction), $A_2$ decreases to $192$ pA so that $\\mathrm{PPR}$ increases from $1.2$ to $1.6$; failure rate rises from $0.05$ to $0.25$; and $\\mathrm{CV}$ increases from $0.25$ to $0.40$. mEPSC frequency decreases by approximately $50\\%$ while mEPSC amplitude is unchanged. All of these changes are exactly those expected from a decrease in $p$ with unchanged $N$ and $q$. With PTX pretreatment, all agonist effects are abolished, which matches the block of $G_{i/o}$ coupling and consequent loss of both $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ and $G_{\\alpha i}$ signaling. This option is fully consistent with the mechanistic and quantal predictions.\n\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nOption B: With agonist, $A_1$ decreases but $A_2$ decreases even more, yielding a lower $\\mathrm{PPR}$ ($0.9$). Failure rate and $\\mathrm{CV}$ both decrease. A reduction in $\\mathrm{PPR}$ is inconsistent with a presynaptic reduction in $p$; similarly, decreases in failure rate and $\\mathrm{CV}$ contradict the binomial prediction $\\mathrm{CV}^2 \\approx (1-p)/(N p)$ for lowered $p$. Furthermore, a residual effect after PTX would imply PTX-insensitive coupling, which contradicts the well-established PTX sensitivity of $G_{i/o}$-coupled mGluR2. \n\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C: Mean evoked EPSCs are unchanged, but mEPSC amplitude decreases by approximately $40\\%$ with no change in frequency; $\\mathrm{PPR}$ and $\\mathrm{CV}$ are unchanged; PTX has no effect. This pattern indicates a postsynaptic change in quantal size $q$ with no presynaptic change in $p$, which is not the canonical outcome of acute mGluR2 activation. The lack of PTX sensitivity further contradicts the $G_{i/o}$ coupling requirement for mGluR2 effects.\n\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: With agonist, $A_1$ decreases but $\\mathrm{PPR}$, failure rate, and $\\mathrm{CV}$ are unchanged, which contradicts the expected effects of a pure presynaptic change in $p$. After PTX, the option claims the agonist still decreases $A_1$ and increases $\\mathrm{PPR}$ because $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$-mediated $Ca_V$ inhibition is PTX-insensitive. This is mechanistically incorrect: $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ release requires receptor-mediated activation of the $G_{i/o}$ heterotrimer, which PTX prevents by blocking receptor–$G_{i/o}$ coupling; thus $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$-dependent effects are also PTX-sensitive.\n\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A accords with the first-principles mechanistic and quantal predictions for mGluR2 activation and its blockade by PTX.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2724915"}]}
