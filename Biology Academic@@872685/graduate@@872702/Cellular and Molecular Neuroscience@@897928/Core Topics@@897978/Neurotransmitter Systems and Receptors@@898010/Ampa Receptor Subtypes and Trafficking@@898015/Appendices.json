According to Ohm's law for ion channels, the macroscopic current is given by the total macroscopic conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{macro}}$, multiplied by the driving force, $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}} = G_{\\mathrm{macro}} (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nThe macroscopic conductance is the sum of the conductances of all individual channels present at the synapse, weighted by their open probability.\n$$G_{\\mathrm{macro}} = \\sum_{k} N_{k}^{\\mathrm{syn}} P_{o,k} \\gamma_k$$\nHere, $N_k^{\\mathrm{syn}}$ is the number of synaptic receptors of type $k$, $P_{o,k}$ is their open probability during the glutamate transient, and $\\gamma_k$ is their single-channel conductance.\n\nSince the driving force $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ is constant before and after plasticity, the multiplicative increase (fold-change) in EPSC amplitude is equivalent to the fold-change in the total macroscopic conductance.\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{I_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{G_{\\mathrm{base}}}$$\nOur task is thus to calculate the total macroscopic conductance before ($G_{\\mathrm{base}}$) and after ($G_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$) the plasticity induction.\n\nThe number of synaptic receptors, $N^{\\mathrm{syn}}$, is determined by the steady-state balance of receptor insertion and removal from the synapse. For a two-compartment model with total receptors $N^{\\mathrm{tot}} = N^{\\mathrm{syn}} + N^{\\mathrm{extra}}$, the steady-state condition is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}} N^{\\mathrm{extra}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}} N^{\\mathrm{syn}}$$\nSubstituting $N^{\\mathrm{extra}} = N^{\\mathrm{tot}} - N^{\\mathrm{syn}}$ gives:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}} (N^{\\mathrm{tot}} - N^{\\mathrm{syn}}) = k_{\\mathrm{off}} N^{\\mathrm{syn}}$$\nSolving for $N^{\\mathrm{syn}}$ yields the number of receptors at the synapse:\n$$N^{\\mathrm{syn}} = N^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$$\n\nWe must apply this framework to the two populations of AMPA receptors: GluA1-containing (type $1$) and GluA1-lacking (type $2$).\n\n**1. Baseline Conductance ($G_{\\mathrm{base}}$)**\n\nAt baseline, we have two distinct receptor populations contributing to the total conductance.\nThe contribution from GluA1-containing receptors (type $1$) is:\n$$G_{1}^{\\mathrm{base}} = N_{1, \\mathrm{base}}^{\\mathrm{syn}} P_{o,0} \\gamma_1 = \\left(N_{1}^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},1} + k_{\\mathrm{off},1}}\\right) P_{o,0} \\gamma_1$$\nThe contribution from GluA1-lacking receptors (type $2$) is:\n$$G_{2}^{\\mathrm{base}} = N_{2, \\mathrm{base}}^{\\mathrm{syn}} P_{o,0} \\gamma_2 = \\left(N_{2}^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},2}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},2} + k_{\\mathrm{off},2}}\\right) P_{o,0} \\gamma_2$$\nThe total baseline conductance is the sum of these two components:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{base}} = G_{1}^{\\mathrm{base}} + G_{2}^{\\mathrm{base}}$$\n\nLet us substitute the given values:\n$N_{1}^{\\mathrm{tot}}=80$, $k_{\\mathrm{on},1}=0.04\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{off},1}=0.06\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\gamma_{1}=15\\,\\mathrm{pS}$, $P_{o,0}=0.20$.\n$N_{2}^{\\mathrm{tot}}=40$, $k_{\\mathrm{on},2}=0.03\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{off},2}=0.06\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\gamma_{2}=12\\,\\mathrm{pS}$.\nUsing exact fractions for precision: $P_{o,0} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nThe synaptic fraction for type $1$ receptors is $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},1} + k_{\\mathrm{off},1}} = \\frac{0.04}{0.04+0.06} = \\frac{0.04}{0.10} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\nThe synaptic fraction for type $2$ receptors is $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},2}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},2} + k_{\\mathrm{off},2}} = \\frac{0.03}{0.03+0.06} = \\frac{0.03}{0.09} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n$$G_{1}^{\\mathrm{base}} = 80 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 15\\,\\mathrm{pS} = 32 \\cdot 3\\,\\mathrm{pS} = 96\\,\\mathrm{pS}$$\n$$G_{2}^{\\mathrm{base}} = 40 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{pS} = 40 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{12}{5}\\,\\mathrm{pS} = 8 \\cdot 4\\,\\mathrm{pS} = 32\\,\\mathrm{pS}$$\n$$G_{\\mathrm{base}} = 96\\,\\mathrm{pS} + 32\\,\\mathrm{pS} = 128\\,\\mathrm{pS}$$\n\n**2. Potentiated Conductance ($G_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$)**\n\nAfter plasticity, GluA1-lacking receptors (type $2$) are unaffected. Their contribution to conductance remains $G_{2}^{\\mathrm{LTP}} = G_{2}^{\\mathrm{base}} = 32\\,\\mathrm{pS}$.\n\nThe GluA1-containing receptor population (type $1$) becomes heterogeneous due to phosphorylation at S831 and S845. As these events are independent, the total pool of $N_{1}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$ receptors can be divided into four subpopulations:\n1.  Unphosphorylated (U): Fraction $(1-p_{831})(1-p_{845})$\n2.  S831-phosphorylated only (P831): Fraction $p_{831}(1-p_{845})$\n3.  S845-phosphorylated only (P845): Fraction $(1-p_{831})p_{845}$\n4.  Doubly phosphorylated (DP): Fraction $p_{831}p_{845}$\n\nThe total conductance from the type 1 population after potentiation, $G_1^{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, is the sum of contributions from these four subpopulations. Due to independence, this can be factored.\nThe conductance of a given GluA1 receptor depends on its S831 state. The trafficking and open probability depend on its S845 state.\nWe can express the total conductance as the sum of contributions from the S845-unphosphorylated and S845-phosphorylated fractions, each averaged over the S831 states.\n\nLet's calculate the average conductance of a GluA1-containing receptor, which only depends on S831 phosphorylation:\n$\\langle\\gamma_1\\rangle_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = (1-p_{831})\\gamma_1 + p_{831}(\\sigma_{831}\\gamma_1) = \\gamma_1(1-p_{831}+p_{831}\\sigma_{831})$\n$\\langle\\gamma_1\\rangle_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = 15 \\left(1-0.6 + 0.6 \\cdot 1.5\\right) = 15 \\left(0.4+0.9\\right) = 15 \\cdot 1.3 = 19.5\\,\\mathrm{pS}$\n\nThe total conductance from the GluA1-containing pool is the sum of contributions from the S845-unphosphorylated fraction and the S845-phosphorylated fraction.\nThe S845-unphosphorylated fraction ($1-p_{845}=0.5$) has baseline trafficking and open probability. Its contribution is:\n$G_{1,\\text{no-P845}} = (1-p_{845}) N_1^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},1}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}}\\right) P_{o,0} \\langle\\gamma_1\\rangle_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$\n$G_{1,\\text{no-P845}} = 0.5 \\cdot 80 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.04}{0.10}\\right) \\cdot 0.20 \\cdot 19.5 = 40 \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot 19.5 = 3.2 \\cdot 19.5 = 62.4\\,\\mathrm{pS}$\n\nThe S845-phosphorylated fraction ($p_{845}=0.5$) has potentiated trafficking and open probability. Its contribution is:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on},1,\\text{LTP}} = \\beta_{845} k_{\\mathrm{on},1} = 2 \\cdot 0.04 = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$P_{o,\\text{LTP}} = \\delta_{845} P_{o,0} = 1.25 \\cdot 0.20 = 0.25$\nThe synaptic fraction for these receptors is $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},1,\\text{LTP}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},1,\\text{LTP}}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08+0.06} = \\frac{0.08}{0.14} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n$G_{1,\\text{P845}} = p_{845} N_1^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on},1,\\text{LTP}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},1,\\text{LTP}}+k_{\\mathrm{off},1}}\\right) P_{o,\\text{LTP}} \\langle\\gamma_1\\rangle_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$\n$G_{1,\\text{P845}} = 0.5 \\cdot 80 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right) \\cdot 0.25 \\cdot 19.5 = 40 \\cdot \\frac{4}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 19.5 = \\frac{40}{7} \\cdot 19.5 = \\frac{780}{7} \\approx 111.428...\\,\\mathrm{pS}$\n\n$G_1^{\\mathrm{LTP}} = G_{1,\\text{no-P845}} + G_{1,\\text{P845}} = 62.4 + \\frac{780}{7} = \\frac{312}{5} + \\frac{780}{7} = \\frac{2184+3900}{35} = \\frac{6084}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS}$. This confirms the calculation in the provided solution using a slightly different but equivalent method.\n\nTotal potentiated conductance:\n$G_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = G_{1}^{\\mathrm{LTP}} + G_{2}^{\\mathrm{LTP}} = \\frac{6084}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS} + 32\\,\\mathrm{pS} = \\frac{6084 + 32 \\cdot 35}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS} = \\frac{6084 + 1120}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS} = \\frac{7204}{35}\\,\\mathrm{pS}$\n\nFinally, the fold-change is:\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{G_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{7204/35 \\,\\mathrm{pS}}{128 \\,\\mathrm{pS}} = \\frac{7204}{35 \\cdot 128}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we note that $7204 = 4 \\cdot 1801$ and $128 = 4 \\cdot 32$.\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{1801}{35 \\cdot 32} = \\frac{1801}{1120}$$\nThe numerator $1801$ is a prime number, so this fraction is in its simplest form.
