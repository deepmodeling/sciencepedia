In this chimera, the extracellular and transmembrane regions come from the human $\\beta_2$-adrenergic receptor, so isoproterenol, a $\\beta$-adrenergic agonist, will bind and activate the receptor. However, the intracellular portions are from the human $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptor, which canonically couples to the G$_{q/11}$ family rather than G$_s$.\n\nUpon agonist binding, the conformational change in the receptor is transmitted to its intracellular domains, which dictate coupling to G$_q$. Activated G$_q$ stimulates phospholipase C beta, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. The most immediate and primary change in second messengers is therefore a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate also acutely elevates cytosolic calcium by release from intracellular stores.\n\nBy contrast, an increase in cAMP would require coupling to G$_s$ (typical of $\\beta_2$ with native intracellular domains), which this chimera lacks; a decrease in cAMP would require G$_i$ coupling (typical of $\\alpha_2$), which is also absent. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a hallmark of receptor tyrosine kinases, not GPCRs. Given proper expression and folding and the presence of downstream components, no change is implausible because the receptor will both bind ligand and couple to G$_q$.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary second messenger change is an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326649"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative predictions, this practice introduces a quantitative framework for describing agonist action.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires three parts: expressing the concentration-response function $E([A])$ in terms of key parameters, determining the relationship for $EC_{50}$, and analyzing the effect of reducing receptor density.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Concentration-Response Function and $EC_{50}$**\n\nThe concentration of the agonist-receptor complex, $[AR]$, is the product of the total receptor concentration, $R_T$, and the fractional occupancy:\n$$[AR] = R_T \\cdot \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}$$\nThe stimulus, $S$, is given as $S = e [AR]$. Substituting the expression for $[AR]$:\n$$S = e R_T \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}$$\nThe response, $E$, is a hyperbolic function of the stimulus $S$:\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\frac{S}{K_E + S}$$\nSubstitute the expression for $S$ into the equation for $E$:\n$$E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{e R_T \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}}{K_E + e R_T \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}}$$\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator of the main fraction by $(K_A + [A])$:\n$$E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{e R_T [A]}{K_E(K_A + [A]) + e R_T [A]}$$\nTo introduce the operational efficacy $\\tau = e R_T / K_E$, we divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $K_E$:\n$$E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\frac{e R_T}{K_E} [A]}{(K_A + [A]) + \\frac{e R_T}{K_E} [A]}$$\nSubstituting $\\tau$ yields the final form of the concentration-response function:\n$$E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau [A]}{K_A + [A] + \\tau [A]} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau [A]}{K_A + (1+\\tau)[A]}$$\nThis is the required expression for $E([A])$.\n\nNext, we find the expression for $EC_{50}$. $EC_{50}$ is the concentration $[A]$ that elicits $50\\%$ of the agonist's own maximal response, which we denote $E'_{max}$. The value of $E'_{max}$ is the limit of $E([A])$ as $[A] \\to \\infty$:\n$$E'_{max} = \\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} E([A]) = \\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau [A]}{K_A + (1+\\tau)[A]} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}$$\nNow, we set $E([A])$ equal to $\\frac{1}{2} E'_{max}$ and solve for $[A] = EC_{50}$:\n$$E(EC_{50}) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau EC_{50}}{K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50}} = \\frac{1}{2} E'_{max} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max} \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}$$\nAssuming $E_{\\max} \\ne 0$ and $\\tau \\ne 0$, we can cancel these terms:\n$$\\frac{EC_{50}}{K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50}} = \\frac{1}{2(1+\\tau)}$$\nCross-multiplication gives:\n$$2(1+\\tau)EC_{50} = K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50}$$\nRearranging to solve for $EC_{50}$:\n$$2(1+\\tau)EC_{50} - (1+\\tau)EC_{50} = K_A$$\n$$(1+\\tau)EC_{50} = K_A$$\n$$EC_{50} = \\frac{K_A}{1+\\tau}$$\nThis equation shows that for an agonist with $\\tau > 0$, the $EC_{50}$ is less than the dissociation constant $K_A$. This represents a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve relative to the binding curve, a hallmark of systems with \"receptor reserve\" or signal amplification.\n\n**Part 2: Effect of Reducing Receptor Density**\n\nReducing the receptor density to a fraction $\\alpha$ of its baseline value means the new total receptor concentration is $\\alpha R_T$. According to the problem statement, this scales $\\tau$ proportionally. Let the baseline transducer ratio be $\\tau_{base} = e R_T / K_E$. The new transducer ratio, $\\tau_{new}$, is:\n$$\\tau_{new} = \\frac{e (\\alpha R_T)}{K_E} = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{e R_T}{K_E}\\right) = \\alpha \\tau_{base}$$\nThe new $EC_{50}$, denoted $EC_{50, new}$, is found by substituting $\\tau_{new}$ into the general expression for $EC_{50}$:\n$$EC_{50, new} = \\frac{K_A}{1+\\tau_{new}} = \\frac{K_A}{1+\\alpha \\tau_{base}}$$\nSince $\\alpha < 1$ for receptor reduction and $\\tau_{base} > 0$ for an agonist, it follows that $1+\\alpha \\tau_{base} < 1+\\tau_{base}$. Therefore, $EC_{50, new} > EC_{50, base}$. This means reducing receptor density increases the $EC_{50}$, causing a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve (a decrease in potency). As $\\alpha \\to 0$, $EC_{50, new} \\to K_A$. Thus, reducing receptor reserve shifts the $EC_{50}$ rightward towards the value of $K_A$.\n\n**Part 3: Specific Calculation**\n\nGiven a baseline $\\tau_{base} = 9$ and a reduction factor $\\alpha = 0.1$.\nThe baseline $EC_{50}$ is:\n$$EC_{50, base} = \\frac{K_A}{1 + \\tau_{base}} = \\frac{K_A}{1+9} = \\frac{K_A}{10}$$\nThe new transducer ratio is $\\tau_{new} = \\alpha \\tau_{base} = 0.1 \\times 9 = 0.9$.\nThe new $EC_{50}$ is:\n$$EC_{50, new} = \\frac{K_A}{1 + \\tau_{new}} = \\frac{K_A}{1+0.9} = \\frac{K_A}{1.9}$$\nThe fold-change in $EC_{50}$ is the ratio $EC_{50, new} / EC_{50, base}$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{K_A/1.9}{K_A/10} = \\frac{10}{1.9} \\approx 5.263$$\nThe $EC_{50}$ increases by approximately $5.3$-fold.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a system with receptor reserve ($\\tau>0$), the observed $EC_{50}$ is shifted leftward from $K_A$ such that $EC_{50} = K_A/(1+\\tau)$. Reducing receptor density scales $\\tau$ and shifts $EC_{50}$ rightward toward $K_A$; with baseline $\\tau=9$ and $\\alpha=0.1$, $EC_{50}$ increases by approximately $5.3$-fold.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with the derivations. The formula $EC_{50} = K_A/(1+\\tau)$ is correct. The qualitative description of the rightward shift of $EC_{50}$ toward $K_A$ upon receptor density reduction is correct. The quantitative calculation of the $\\approx 5.3$-fold increase in $EC_{50}$ is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Receptor reserve does not affect $EC_{50}$, which always equals $K_A$; therefore, reducing receptor density has no effect on phenylephrine potency.**\nThis is incorrect. The derivation shows $EC_{50} = K_A/(1+\\tau)$, which depends on $\\tau$ (a measure of receptor reserve). It only equals $K_A$ if $\\tau=0$. Consequently, reducing receptor density, which alters $\\tau$, does affect potency.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Receptor reserve ($\\tau>0$) decreases apparent affinity so that $EC_{50} > K_A$. Reducing receptor density increases apparent affinity, shifting $EC_{50}$ leftward.**\nThis statement reverses the correct relationships. Receptor reserve increases apparent potency, meaning $EC_{50} < K_A$. Reducing receptor density decreases apparent potency, increasing $EC_{50}$ and shifting it rightward.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The fold-shift in $EC_{50}$ after reducing receptor density to a fraction $\\alpha$ depends only on $\\alpha$ and equals $1/\\alpha$; for $\\alpha=0.1$, $EC_{50}$ increases $10$-fold regardless of $\\tau$.**\nThis is incorrect. The derived fold-change is $(1+\\tau)/(1+\\alpha\\tau)$, which depends on both $\\alpha$ and $\\tau$. The statement that the shift is $1/\\alpha$ is an approximation valid only for very large $\\tau$. For the given values, the change is $\\approx5.3$-fold, not $10$-fold.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If phenylephrine has limited intrinsic efficacy, reducing receptor density can decrease $EC_{50}$ because fewer receptors sequester agonist, increasing free $[A]$ at the remaining receptors.**\nThis is incorrect. First, within the provided model, reducing receptor density always increases $EC_{50}$ (or leaves it unchanged if $\\tau=0$); it never decreases it. Second, the reasoning invokes agonist sequestration or \"buffering,\" a phenomenon not included in the standard mass-action model provided, which assumes $[A]$ is not depleted by binding.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2697624"}, {"introduction": "The number of receptors on a cell's surface is not static; it is dynamically regulated by a constant cycle of trafficking.
