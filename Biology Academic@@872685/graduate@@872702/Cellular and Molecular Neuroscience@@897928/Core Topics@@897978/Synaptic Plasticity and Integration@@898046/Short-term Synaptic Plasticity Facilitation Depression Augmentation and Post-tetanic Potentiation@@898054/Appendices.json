The dynamics are governed by a single-compartment model with first-order clearance. This physical situation is described by a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe rate of change of the calcium concentration, $\\frac{d}{dt}[Ca]_{\\text{res}}(t)$, is proportional to the concentration itself, with a negative constant of proportionality.

Let $R(t)$ denote the fraction of release-ready resources available at time $t$, normalized by the maximal pool size $R_{\\max}$. The synapse obeys the following well-tested facts and core definitions:\n- At each presynaptic action potential, an expected fraction $p$ of the currently available resources is released, producing an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC, excitatory postsynaptic current) amplitude proportional to the released fraction.\n- Immediately after a spike at time $t_{n}$, the available fraction jumps from the pre-spike value $R(t_{n}^{-})$ to the post-spike value $R(t_{n}^{+}) = R(t_{n}^{-})(1 - p)$.\n- Between spikes, resources recover exponentially toward $R_{\\max}$ with a time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, implementing $\\,\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{R_{\\max} - R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\,$ for $t \\in (t_{n}, t_{n+1})$.\n\nAssume there is no facilitation, augmentation, or post-tetanic potentiation; that is, the release probability $p$ is constant, and only depletion and recovery shape the responses.

The problem describes a canonical model of short-term synaptic depression (the Tsodyks-Markram model in its simplified form for depression only), which is a fundamental concept in cellular and molecular neuroscience. The model is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There is a slight imprecision in the problem statement regarding the variable $R(t)$. It is defined as a normalized fraction, yet the differential equation $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{R_{\\max} - R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}$ suggests $R$ has the same units as $R_{\\max}$. However, this ambiguity is resolved by interpreting $R(t)$ as the absolute quantity of resources and $R_{\\max}$ as the maximum quantity. The subsequent request to use $R_{\\max}=1$ makes this interpretation fully consistent with a normalized model where $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{1 - R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}$. With this standard interpretation, the problem is internally consistent and solvable. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. We seek the steady-state normalized EPSC amplitude, $A_{\\infty}(f)$. By definition, this is the amount of resource released at steady state, $p R_{\\infty}^{-}$, divided by the maximal pool size $R_{\\max}$. Thus, $A_{\\infty}(f) = \\frac{p R_{\\infty}^{-}}{R_{\\max}}$, where $R_{\\infty}^{-}$ is the resource level just before a spike in the steady state.\n\nStep 1: Solve the recovery dynamics between spikes.\nThe recovery of resources between spike $n$ at time $t_n$ and spike $n+1$ at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta$ is described by the linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{R_{\\max} - R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\n$$\nThis equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\int_{R(t_n^+)}^{R(t_{n+1}^-)} \\frac{dR}{R_{\\max} - R} = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{dt}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\n$$\nThe initial condition for this interval is the post-spike resource level $R(t_n^+)$.

This invariance demonstrates that the $\\mathrm{PPR}$ isolates the presynaptic component of synaptic transmission, specifically the dynamics of release probability. Consequently, an experimentally observed change in $\\mathrm{PPR}$ is strong evidence for a presynaptic locus of modulation, while the absence of a change in $\\mathrm{PPR}$ in conjunction with an amplitude change points towards a postsynaptic locus.
