The copy numbers are within physiologically realistic ranges. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a stoichiometric calculation (a classic limiting reactant problem). The inclusion of Shank is a non-conflicting distractor, as the problem constrains the system to only the PSD-95–GKAP interaction. The problem is objective and uses precise scientific language. It does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the maximum possible number of product molecules formed from two reactants with given initial quantities. This is a problem of stoichiometry and identification of the limiting reactant.\n\nLet the molecular species be denoted as follows:\n- $P$: PSD-95\n- $G$: GKAP\n- $C$: The binary complex formed by PSD-95 and GKAP.\n\nThe initial copy numbers of the reactants are given as:\n- $N_{P, \\text{initial}} = 300$\n- $N_{G, \\text{initial}} = 200$\n\nThe problem states that the copy number for Shank ($N_{\\text{Shank}} = 150$) is also provided. However, the system is explicitly constrained to the binary interaction between PSD-95 and GKAP, with the condition that \"no other reactions deplete these pools.\" Therefore, the information about Shank is irrelevant to the calculation and must be disregarded.\n\nThe formation of the binary complex occurs with a strict $1:1$ stoichiometry. The reaction can be written as:\n$$ P + G \\longrightarrow C $$\nThis equation indicates that one molecule of $P$ reacts with one molecule of $G$ to produce one molecule of $C$.\n\nThe theoretical maximum number of complexes, $N_{C, \\text{max}}$, is limited by the reactant that is available in the smallest quantity relative to the stoichiometric requirement. Since the stoichiometric ratio is $1:1$, the maximum number of complexes is directly limited by the reactant with the lower initial copy number.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of complexes formed. To form $x$ complexes, $x$ molecules of $P$ and $x$ molecules of $G$ must be consumed. The number of complexes is therefore constrained by the initial availability of each reactant:\n$$ x \\le N_{P, \\text{initial}} \\implies x \\le 300 $$\n$$ x \\le N_{G, \\text{initial}} \\implies x \\le 200 $$\n\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, $x$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of the two initial amounts. The maximum possible value for $x$ is thus:\n$$ N_{C, \\text{max}} = \\min(N_{P, \\text{initial}}, N_{G, \\text{initial}}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ N_{C, \\text{max}} = \\min(300, 200) = 200 $$\n\nThe theoretical maximum number of PSD-95–GKAP binary complexes that can form is $200$.\n\nThe second part of the query is to identify the limiting component. The limiting component (or limiting reactant) is the reactant that is completely consumed when the reaction proceeds to its maximum extent. In this case, forming $200$ complexes will consume $200$ molecules of GKAP, exhausting its entire initial pool ($200$ out of $200$). In contrast, only $200$ molecules of PSD-95 will be consumed, leaving a surplus of $300 - 200 = 100$ molecules of PSD-95.\n\nBecause the pool of GKAP is depleted first, GKAP is the limiting component for the formation of the binary complex.\n\nThe question asks for the final answer to be the maximum number of complexes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{200}$$", "id": "2739105"}, {"introduction": "While stoichiometry sets the upper limit on complex formation, the stability of these complexes is governed by equilibrium binding dynamics.

It is a straightforward application of equilibrium binding theory. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $P$ represent the PDZ$3$ binding site on DLG4 and $L$ represent the TARP ligand. The binding reaction is a reversible process governed by the law of mass action:\n$$ P + L \\rightleftharpoons PL $$\nwhere $PL$ is the complex of PDZ$3$ bound to TARP.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[P][L]}{[PL]} $$\nwhere $[P]$, $[L]$, and $[PL]$ are the molar concentrations of free PDZ$3$, free TARP, and the bound complex at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of total PDZ$3$ sites that are occupied by TARP. It is defined as:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PL]}{[P]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[PL]}{[P] + [PL]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_D$ to solve for $[P]$:\n$$ [P] = \\frac{K_D [PL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PL]}{\\frac{K_D [PL]}{[L]} + [PL]} = \\frac{[PL]}{[PL] \\left(\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1} $$\nThis simplifies to the Hill-Langmuir equation for one-to-one binding:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]} $$\nThe problem states that the free TARP concentration, which corresponds to $[L]$, is constant and equal to $5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}$, where $K_D^{\\text{WT}}$ is the dissociation constant for the wild-type protein.\n\nFor the wild-type (WT) case:\nThe dissociation constant is $K_D^{\\text{WT}}$. The ligand concentration is $[L] = 5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}$. The fractional occupancy, $\\theta_{\\text{WT}}$, is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{WT}} = \\frac{5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}}{K_D^{\\text{WT}} + 5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}}{6 K_D^{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\nFor the mutant (MUT) case:\nThe dissociation constant is increased by a factor of $10$, so $K_D^{\\text{MUT}} = 10 K_D^{\\text{WT}}$. The ligand concentration remains the same, $[L] = 5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}$. The fractional occupancy, $\\theta_{\\text{MUT}}$, is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{MUT}} = \\frac{5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}}{K_D^{\\text{MUT}} + 5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}}{10 K_D^{\\text{WT}} + 5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{5 K_D^{\\text{WT}}}{15 K_D^{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nAMPAR anchoring, let us denote it by $A$, is stated to scale linearly with the fractional occupancy $\\theta$. This implies $A = c \\cdot \\theta$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\nThus, for the wild-type and mutant:\n$$ A_{\\text{WT}} = c \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{WT}} $$\n$$ A_{\\text{MUT}} = c \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{MUT}} $$\n\nThe fractional decrease in AMPAR anchoring in the mutant relative to wild-type is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Decrease} = \\frac{A_{\\text{WT}} - A_{\\text{MUT}}}{A_{\\text{WT}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A$:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Decrease} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{WT}} - c \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{MUT}}}{c \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{WT}} - \\theta_{\\text{MUT}}}{\\theta_{\\text{WT}}} = 1 - \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{MUT}}}{\\theta_{\\text{WT}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the calculated values for $\\theta_{\\text{WT}}$ and $\\theta_{\\text{MUT}}$:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Decrease} = 1 - \\frac{1/3}{5/6} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{6}{5}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{6}{15} = 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.6$.

A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe fluorescence recovery process is dictated by the kinetics of the mobile fraction of scaffold proteins. The problem states that recovery is a single-exponential process and is \"dominated by reversible binding,\" with diffusion being comparatively fast. This is the definition of the reaction-limited regime.\n\nIn this regime, the rate-limiting step for the recovery of fluorescence in the bleached spot is the dissociation of photobleached molecules from their binding sites. The concentration of available unbleached (fluorescent) protein in the surrounding pool is assumed to be constant and its transport to the binding site is not rate-limiting. Therefore, as soon as a bleached molecule dissociates from a site, a fluorescent molecule from the reservoir immediately occupies it.\n\nLet $[B_b](t)$ be the concentration of bleached protein bound to synaptic sites at time $t$ after the photobleaching event. The dissociation of these molecules is a first-order process governed by the dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ \\frac{d[B_b](t)}{dt} = -k_{\\text{off}} [B_b](t) $$\nThe solution to this differential equation is an exponential decay:\n$$ [B_b](t) = [B_b](0) \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}} t) $$\nwhere $[B_b](0)$ is the concentration of bound bleached molecules immediately after bleaching at $t=0$.\n\nThe fluorescence intensity in the bleached region, $F(t)$, is proportional to the concentration of fluorescent bound molecules, $[B_f](t)$. The recovery of fluorescence occurs as bleached molecules dissociate and are replaced by fluorescent ones. The total concentration of binding sites within the mobile pool is constant. Thus, the increase in fluorescent bound molecules must mirror the decrease in bleached bound molecules.\nThe fluorescence signal $F(t)$ will recover from its initial post-bleach value, $F(0)$, to a final plateau value, $F_{\\infty}$, according to:\n$$ F(t) = F_{\\infty} - (F_{\\infty} - F(0)) \\exp(-k_{obs} t) $$\nThe problem states this recovery is a single-exponential process. Based on our analysis of the rate-limiting step, the observed rate constant, $k_{obs}$, must be the microscopic dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}$. This is because the overall rate of recovery is dictated by the slowest step in the sequence, which is the unbinding of bleached molecules.\nTherefore, $k_{obs} = k_{\\text{off}}$.\n\nThe half-time of recovery, $t_{1/2}$, is the time at which the fluorescence has recovered halfway to its plateau. For a first-order process, it is related to the rate constant by:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{obs}} $$\nSubstituting $k_{obs} = k_{\\text{off}}$, we obtain the direct relationship between the experimental observable $t_{1/2}$ and the microscopic rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{off}}} $$\nFrom this, we can derive the expression for $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we use the provided value $t_{1/2} = 60\\ \\text{s}$ to estimate $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{60\\ \\text{s}} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$, we compute:\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{60}\\ \\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 0.01155245\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} \\approx 1.16 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe mobile fraction of $0.4$ indicates that only $40\\%$ of the total protein population is involved in these dynamics, while the other $60\\%$ is immobile on this timescale. This information is contextual and does not enter the calculation of $k_{\\text{off}}$ for the mobile population itself.\n\nFinally, we address the qualitative reasoning. We consider the effect of increasing the density of ligand binding sites, $L$, within the PSD.\n(a) Effect on apparent mobile fraction: The mobile fraction can be viewed as the fraction of protein molecules in the unbound, diffusive state at equilibrium. The binding reaction is $P + S \\rightleftharpoons PS$. According to the law of mass action, increasing the concentration of one reactant (the binding sites $S$, whose density is $L$) will shift the equilibrium to the right, favoring the formation of the product ($PS$). This means a larger proportion of the protein population will exist in the bound state at any given moment, and a smaller proportion will be in the free state. Consequently, the apparent mobile fraction, interpreted as the instantaneously free population, is expected to decrease.\n\n(b) Effect on recovery half-time $t_{1/2}$: As established, in the binding-limited regime, the recovery half-time is determined by $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k_{\\text{off}}$. The dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$ is an intrinsic property of the bond between the scaffold protein and its ligand site. It reflects the stability of the complex and is independent of the concentration of free proteins or available sites. Therefore, increasing the site density $L$ does not alter $k_{\\text{off}}$. As a result, the recovery half-time $t_{1/2}$ is expected to remain unchanged.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.16 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "2739138"}]}
