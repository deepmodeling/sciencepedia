It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to predict the effect of a high concentration ($10$ mM) of the fast $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ chelator BAPTA on two distinct forms of LTD: NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD. The analysis must be based on the provided first principles, specifically the differential requirements for $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signaling.\n\n**1. Analysis of NMDAR-LTD**\n\nNMDAR-LTD is induced by low-frequency stimulation, which causes a modest but prolonged influx of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ through NMDAR channels into the postsynaptic spine. According to principle (b), the induction of NMDAR-LTD is gated by the activation of the $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-dependent enzymes calmodulin (CaM) and protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B, or calcineurin). These enzymes, particularly PP2B, require a sustained elevation of cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ to a level of several hundred nanomolar to low micromolar. This $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signal must be spatially distributed throughout a significant portion of the spine cytoplasm to effectively engage the phosphatase cascade. It is not a highly localized \"nanodomain\" signal, but rather a more diffuse \"microdomain\" signal.\n\nWe are given that the internal solution contains $10$ mM BAPTA, which is a very high concentration. Principle (a) dictates how such a buffer affects $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ dynamics. As a fast ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is large), high-affinity ($K_d = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is small) chelator present at high concentration, BAPTA will rapidly bind any free $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ions that enter the spine. The high buffer concentration ensures a large sink for $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, effectively preventing the free cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ concentration from rising significantly above resting levels and collapsing its spatial spread. Consequently, the diffuse, spine-wide $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signal required to activate CaM and PP2B will not be established. Without the activation of this phosphatase cascade, the downstream events leading to LTD will not occur.\n\nTherefore, the prediction is that $10$ mM BAPTA will abolish NMDAR-LTD.\n\n**2. Analysis of mGluR-LTD**\n\nmGluR-LTD is induced by activation of Gq-coupled group I mGluRs. According to principle (c), this activation initiates a signaling cascade via PLC$\\beta$, leading to the production of the second messengers $IP_3$ and DAG. This pathway is explicitly stated to drive a form of LTD that is protein synthesis-dependent and does *not* require a *large* postsynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ elevation.\n\nThe primary signaling mechanism is chemical, not ionic. The key effectors are downstream of PLC$\\beta$. For example, DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), and the pathway as a whole triggers rapid, local protein synthesis, which is a hallmark of this form of LTD. While $IP_3$ can act on $IP_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum to release $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, principle (c) emphasizes that a large cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ increase is not a prerequisite for the induction of mGluR-LTD. The core machinery can proceed via the G-protein/PLC$\\beta$/DAG/PKC/protein-synthesis axis.\n\nIn the presence of $10$ mM BAPTA, any $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ released from internal stores would be rapidly chelated. However, since the induction mechanism is not critically dependent on this $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ rise, its buffering by BAPTA should not prevent the LTD. The primary G-protein signaling pathway remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the prediction is that $10$ mM BAPTA will spare (i.e., not block) mGluR-LTD.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe analysis indicates that NMDAR-LTD will be abolished due to its strict dependence on a diffuse cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signal, which is suppressed by BAPTA. In contrast, mGluR-LTD will be spared because its primary induction mechanism is a G-protein-coupled pathway that does not require a large elevation in cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. $10$ mM BAPTA abolishes NMDAR-LTD but spares mGluR-LTD; fast buffering collapses the diffuse, spine-wide $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signal needed to activate CaM/PP2B for NMDAR-LTD, whereas mGluR-LTD initiation proceeds primarily through G protein–PLC signaling and local translation with minimal dependence on cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ rise.**\nThis statement perfectly aligns with the derived conclusion. It correctly predicts the divergent outcomes for the two LTD forms and provides the correct biophysical and biochemical reasoning based on the provided principles. The distinction between the diffuse $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signal for NMDAR-LTD sensitivity and the G-protein-centric mechanism for mGluR-LTD is accurately captured. **Correct**.\n\n**B. $10$ mM BAPTA blocks mGluR-LTD but not NMDAR-LTD; NMDAR-LTD depends on nanodomain $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signals tightly coupled to NMDAR pores that are resistant to buffering, whereas mGluR-LTD requires diffuse $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ elevations that BAPTA suppresses.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It inverts the $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-dependency of the two pathways. The prolonged, modest $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signal for NMDAR-LTD is susceptible to a high concentration of a fast buffer. The assertion that this signal is a \"nanodomain\" resistant to buffering is typically associated with sensors very close to the channel pore, such as those for LTP, not the phosphatase activation for LTD. It also incorrectly posits a strong $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ requirement for mGluR-LTD, contrary to principle (c). **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $10$ mM BAPTA enhances NMDAR-LTD by lowering $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ to favor phosphatase over kinase activation, and has no effect on mGluR-LTD; the reduced $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ level selectively biases signaling toward depression.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While it is true that lower $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ levels favor phosphatases over kinases (the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro or \"BCM\" theory), a concentration of $10$ mM BAPTA will not simply \"lower\" the signal into an optimal range for LTD. It will clamp the $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ concentration near rest, abolishing the signal required for phosphatase activation altogether. Buffering is not enhancement in this case; it is elimination. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Both NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD are abolished by $10$ mM BAPTA; all LTD induction mechanisms in CA1 require substantial increases in cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ that are prevented by fast buffering.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The assertion that *all* LTD mechanisms require substantial $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ increases is a false generalization. It directly contradicts principle (c), which specifies that mGluR-LTD can proceed without a large postsynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ elevation. Therefore, while it correctly predicts the blockade of NMDAR-LTD, it is wrong about mGluR-LTD. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. NMDAR-LTD is unaffected, whereas mGluR-LTD is enhanced by $10$ mM BAPTA; chelation relieves $IP_3$ receptor auto-inhibition by $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, promoting mGluR-LTD while leaving NMDAR-driven LTD intact.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It wrongly claims NMDAR-LTD is unaffected; as derived, it is highly sensitive to BAPTA. The proposed mechanism for enhancement of mGluR-LTD (relieving $IP_3$R autoinhibition) is a real but secondary effect; it does not represent the primary outcome, and more importantly, the premise concerning NMDAR-LTD is fundamentally flawed. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2722030"}, {"introduction": "Once an LTD-inducing signal is triggered, a primary expression mechanism involves the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane.
