Conductivity is the reciprocal of resistivity, $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation yields:\n$$\n\\vec{E} = \\rho \\vec{J}\n$$\nWe consider a cylindrical geometry with length $L$ and constant cross-sectional area $A$. For a steady-state, uniform axial current, both the electric field $\\vec{E}$ and the current density $\\vec{J}$ are constant in magnitude and directed along the axis of the cylinder. Let this axis be the $x$-axis. The magnitudes are $E = |\\vec{E}|$ and $J = |\\vec{J}|$.\n\nThe total potential difference, $\\Delta V$, across the length $L$ of the cylinder is the integral of the electric field along its length. For a uniform field, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta V = E L\n$$\nThe total current, $I$, flowing through the cylinder is the integral of the current density over the cross-sectional area. For a uniform current density perpendicular to the cross-section, this simplifies to:\n$$\nI = J A\n$$\nThe electrical resistance, $R$, is defined by the macroscopic Ohm's law as the ratio of the potential difference to the total current:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Delta V}{I}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta V$ and $I$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{E L}{J A}\n$$\nFrom the microscopic Ohm's law, we have the relation $E = \\rho J$.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the peak rise in free calcium concentration, $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\text{peak}}$, and then to evaluate it numerically.\n\nFirst, we derive the analytical expression starting from fundamental principles.\n\nThe total current, $I_{\\text{total}}$, entering the spine head is the sum of currents from all $N$ open N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), each passing a current $i$.\n$$ I_{\\text{total}} = N \\cdot i $$\n\nThis current flows for a duration $\\tau$.

Therefore, the added calcium is distributed between two states: free ions, with concentration change $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Ca}]$, and buffer-bound ions, with concentration change $\\Delta[\\mathrm{CaB}]$.

It is a standard, non-trivial exercise in biophysical reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to determine the consequences of increasing the spine neck radius $r_{\\mathrm{n}}$ to $r_{\\mathrm{n}}^{\\prime} = 1.5\\,r_{\\mathrm{n}}$. We must trace the cascade of effects through the system's electrical and chemical properties.\n\nLet the initial neck radius be $r_{\\mathrm{n},1}$ and the initial cross-sectional area be $A_1 = \\pi r_{\\mathrm{n},1}^{2}$.\nThe new radius is $r_{\\mathrm{n},2} = 1.5\\,r_{\\mathrm{n},1}$.\nThe new cross-sectional area is $A_2 = \\pi r_{\\mathrm{n},2}^{2} = \\pi (1.5\\,r_{\\mathrm{n},1})^{2} = 2.25\\,\\pi r_{\\mathrm{n},1}^{2} = 2.25\\,A_1$. The area increases by a factor of $2.25$.\n\n**1. Effect on Electrical Properties and Calcium Influx (Transient Amplitude)**\nThe electrical resistance of the spine neck is given as $R_{\\mathrm{neck}} \\propto L_{\\mathrm{n}}/A$.\nSince $L_{\\mathrm{n}}$ is constant and $A$ increases to $2.25\\,A_1$, the neck resistance must decrease:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{neck},2} \\propto \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{n}}}{A_2} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{n}}}{2.25\\,A_1} = \\frac{1}{2.25} R_{\\mathrm{neck},1}$$\nA lower neck resistance implies that the spine head is less electrically isolated from the parent dendrite. Consequently, for a given synaptic current, the resulting local depolarization in the spine head, $V_{\\mathrm{head}}$, will be smaller because charge dissipates more rapidly into the dendrite (which acts as an electrical sink).\nThe problem states that the calcium current through NMDA receptors is dependent on $V_{\\mathrm{head}}$ to relieve the magnesium block. A smaller $V_{\\mathrm{head}}$ leads to less relief of this block and thus a smaller calcium influx.\nA smaller calcium influx results in a lower peak concentration of calcium in the spine head volume $V_{\\mathrm{h}}$.\nTherefore, the amplitude of the calcium transient decreases.\n\n**2. Effect on Calcium Clearance (Transient Duration)**\nThe problem specifies that when diffusion dominates, the decay of the calcium transient is described by a time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\propto V_{\\mathrm{h}}\\,L_{\\mathrm{n}}/A$.\nThe parameters $V_{\\mathrm{h}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{n}}$ are held constant, while the area $A$ increases to $2.25\\,A_1$. The new time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff},2}$, will be:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff},2} \\propto \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{h}}\\,L_{\\mathrm{n}}}{A_2} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{h}}\\,L_{\\mathrm{n}}}{2.25\\,A_1} = \\frac{1}{2.25} \\tau_{\\mathrm{diff},1}$$\nThe time constant decreases. A smaller time constant signifies a faster decay process. Physically, this is because the wider neck provides a larger pathway for calcium ions to diffuse out of the limited volume of the spine head into the much larger volume of the dendrite.\nTherefore, the duration of the calcium transient decreases.\n\n**3. Effect on Synaptic Plasticity**\nWe have concluded that widening the spine neck leads to a calcium transient with both a smaller amplitude and a shorter duration.\nThe rule for plasticity states: LTP is favored by \"larger and briefer\" transients that exceed a high threshold, while LTD is favored by \"smaller, more modest\" calcium rises.\nThe resulting calcium signal is now smaller. This makes it less likely to cross the high threshold required for the induction of LTP. Instead, it falls into the regime described as \"smaller, more modest,\" which is associated with LTD or no potentiation.\nThe combined effect is a shift away from the conditions that induce LTP.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n- Calcium transient amplitude: Decreases.\n- Calcium transient duration: Decreases.\n- Plasticity: Shifts away from LTP, toward LTD or no change.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. The calcium transient amplitude increases and its duration increases; plasticity shifts toward long-term potentiation (LTP).**\nThis is incorrect. The amplitude decreases, and the duration decreases.
