An increase in $CV^{-2}$ (from $0.8$ to $2.4$) is consistent with an increase in either $N$ or $P_r$.\n    - The observation that mEPSC amplitude is unchanged suggests that the quantal size ($q$), which reflects the postsynaptic response to a single vesicle of neurotransmitter, has not changed. This argues against postsynaptic potentiation mechanisms that involve increased receptor conductance or density at already-existing synapses.\n    - The increase in mEPSC frequency (from $1.0$ Hz to $1.8$ Hz) is often interpreted as evidence for a presynaptic change, possibly reflecting an increased basal probability of vesicle fusion.\n\n    The data set is internally consistent and points strongly toward a presynaptic locus of expression for LTP, specifically an increase in $P_r$, because the PPR decreased. A purely postsynaptic change would not alter PPR. The unsilencing of silent synapses (a postsynaptic change that increases $N$) would increase mean amplitude and decrease failure rate but is not expected to alter the intrinsic PPR of individual sites. Therefore, the data strongly favors a presynaptic change in $P_r$ over postsynaptic unsilencing, although a mixed mechanism cannot be ruled out a priori. The problem is well-constructed to force a critical distinction between these possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a valid and non-trivial challenge based on established principles of synaptic physiology. Therefore, a full analysis is warranted.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two stages: first, an interpretation of the provided data, and second, an evaluation of each option's proposed interpretation and control experiments.\n\n**Data Interpretation**\nThe central question in LTP expression is whether the potentiation is caused by presynaptic changes (releasing more neurotransmitter) or postsynaptic changes (responding more strongly to the same amount of neurotransmitter).\n\n1.  **Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR)**: The PPR decreased from $\\approx 1.9$ to $\\approx 1.2$. PPR is inversely related to the initial release probability, $P_r$. A high $P_r$ leads to depletion of readily-releasable vesicles after the first stimulus, resulting in a smaller response to the second stimulus (paired-pulse depression, PPR $< 1$). A low $P_r$ results in residual calcium accumulation dominating over depletion, leading to a larger response to the second stimulus (paired-pulse facilitation, PPR $> 1$). The observed change from facilitation (PPR $> 1$) to a value closer to $1$ is a canonical signature of an increase in $P_r$. This strongly supports a **presynaptic** expression mechanism.\n\n2.  **Failure Rate and $CV^{-2}$**: The failure rate decreased significantly (from $0.45$ to $0.15$), and $CV^{-2}$ increased (from $0.8$ to $2.4$). Both changes are consistent with an increase in release probability ($P_r$) and/or an increase in the number of release sites ($N$). These parameters alone cannot distinguish between a presynaptic $P_r$ change and the postsynaptic unsilencing of synapses (which effectively increases $N$).\n\n3.  **Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs)**: The mean mEPSC amplitude, which is a measure of the quantal size ($q$), remained unchanged. This indicates that the postsynaptic response to a quantum of neurotransmitter has not been altered, arguing against postsynaptic mechanisms like an increase in AMPAR single-channel conductance or an increase in the number of receptors at synapses that were already functional. The increase in mEPSC frequency is also consistent with a presynaptic enhancement.\n\n**Conclusion from Data**: The decrease in PPR is the most decisive piece of evidence. It strongly indicates that the LTP observed has a significant, if not dominant, **presynaptic** component mediated by an increase in release probability, $P_r$. The main alternative hypothesis to explain the reduced failure rate is the unsilencing of synapses that previously contained only NMDARs (and no AMPARs). The problem requires proposing experiments to distinguish these two possibilities.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Predominantly presynaptic LTP via increased release probability; controls: (i) measure the use-dependent block of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) during low-frequency stimulation before and after LTP; prediction: a faster block after LTP indicates higher release probability; (ii) compare minimal-stimulation failure rates at $-70$ mV (AMPAR) and $+40$ mV (NMDAR) before and after LTP; prediction: a presynaptic change reduces failures at both voltages, whereas unsilencing reduces failures mainly at $-70$ mV.**\n\n-   **Interpretation**: \"Predominantly presynaptic LTP via increased release probability\". This interpretation is strongly supported by the data, particularly the reduced PPR.\n-   **Control (i)**: MK-801 is an open-channel blocker of NMDARs. The rate of block during low-frequency stimulation depends directly on how often the channel opens, which is proportional to the presynaptic release probability, $P_r$. If LTP increases $P_r$, glutamate will be released more reliably, NMDAR channels will open more frequently, and the block by MK-801 will proceed more rapidly. This is a classic and robust assay for changes in $P_r$. The prediction is correct.\n-   **Control (ii)**: This experiment directly tests the silent synapse hypothesis. A silent synapse, by definition, has NMDARs but lacks functional AMPARs. Before LTP, stimulation of such a synapse would yield a \"failure\" at $-70$ mV (no AMPAR current) but a \"success\" at $+40$ mV (NMDAR current is present). If LTP involves a presynaptic increase in $P_r$, then failures of release decrease, which should be reflected in the failure rates of *both* AMPAR and NMDAR currents. If LTP involves unsilencing, new AMPARs are inserted into previously silent synapses. This would specifically decrease the failure rate at $-70$ mV, with little or no change to the failure rate at $+40$ mV (since those synapses were not \"failures\" at $+40$ mV to begin with). The prediction is correct and the experiment is elegantly designed to distinguish the hypotheses.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. The interpretation is consistent with the data, and the two proposed controls are independent, mechanistically sound, and provide a clear, falsifiable test to distinguish a change in presynaptic release probability from the unsilencing of postsynaptic sites.\n\n**B. Predominantly postsynaptic LTP via alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor insertion; controls: (i) show an increase in miniature EPSC frequency; (ii) demonstrate inward rectification of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor currents indicating GluA$2$-lacking receptor insertion; prediction: these establish postsynaptic expression and exclude unsilencing.**\n\n-   **Interpretation**: \"Predominantly postsynaptic LTP...\". This contradicts the strong evidence from the decreased PPR indicating a presynaptic change.\n-   **Control (i)**: An increase in mEPSC frequency is part of the initial data provided in the problem statement; it is not a *proposed future control*. It is also more commonly associated with presynaptic, not postsynaptic, changes.\n-   **Control (ii)**: Demonstrating insertion of GluA$2$-lacking (and thus inwardly rectifying) AMPARs is a valid way to test for a specific postsynaptic mechanism. However, the prediction that this \"exclude[s] unsilencing\" is false. In fact, the insertion of GluA$2$-lacking AMPARs is widely considered to be a key mechanism *of* unsilencing. This experiment does not arbitrate between the central hypotheses.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The initial interpretation is inconsistent with key data, one \"control\" is a given fact, and the logic of the second control's prediction is flawed.\n\n**C. Mixed pre- and postsynaptic LTP; controls: (i) vary extracellular calcium $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_o$ to construct a variance–mean plot and fit a parabola to extract quantal size; prediction: an increase in quantal size confirms postsynaptic change; (ii) load postsynaptic neurons with $20$ mM 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) to block postsynaptic calcium; prediction: persistence of LTP with BAPTA confirms presynaptic dominance and excludes unsilencing.**\n\n-   **Interpretation**: \"Mixed pre- and postsynaptic LTP\". While plausible in general, the data strongly favors a presynaptic component.\n-   **Control (i)**: Non-stationary fluctuation analysis by varying $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_o$ is a valid, though laborious, method to estimate quantal parameters. The prediction that an increase in quantal size ($q$) confirms a postsynaptic change is correct. However, the provided mEPSC data (unchanged amplitude) already strongly suggests that $q$ has not changed, making this a confirmatory experiment at best.\n-   **Control (ii)**: Loading the postsynaptic cell with the fast calcium chelator BAPTA is a standard method to block the *induction* of NMDAR-dependent LTP. The prediction that \"persistence of LTP with BAPTA confirms presynaptic dominance\" is problematic. It confounds induction with expression. If LTP induction persists despite postsynaptic BAPTA, it suggests a presynaptic *induction* mechanism, not necessarily a presynaptic *expression* dominance. Furthermore, the claim that it \"excludes unsilencing\" is incorrect. Unsilencing is a postsynaptic expression mechanism typically triggered by a postsynaptic Ca$^{2+}$ signal via NMDARs. Therefore, postsynaptic BAPTA should *prevent* the induction of LTP expressed via unsilencing. The logic is flawed.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The interpretation is not the most direct one. More importantly, the logic explaining the outcome of the second control experiment is scientifically unsound.\n\n**D. Predominantly presynaptic LTP via recruitment of additional release sites; controls: (i) show an increased alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor current ratio; prediction: a higher ratio indicates more functional release sites and rules out unsilencing; (ii) apply cyclothiazide to block alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor desensitization; prediction: elimination of failures after cyclothiazide excludes silent synapses and confirms presynaptic expression.**\n\n-   **Interpretation**: \"Predominantly presynaptic LTP via recruitment of additional release sites\". This implies an increase in $N$, not $P_r$. An increase in $N$ alone would not cause the observed decrease in PPR. Therefore, this interpretation is inconsistent with the data.\n-   **Control (i)**: An increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio is the canonical signature of postsynaptic LTP via AMPAR insertion or unsilencing. The prediction that this \"rules out unsilencing\" is diametrically opposite to the established understanding; it would, in fact, provide strong evidence *for* unsilencing.\n-   **Control (ii)**: Applying cyclothiazide (CTZ) to potentiate AMPARs is a technique, but its ability to definitively \"exclude silent synapses\" is weak. True silent synapses have no AMPARs, so CTZ would have no target. If it uncovers previously sub-threshold responses, it does not rigorously distinguish between very low $P_r$ and a very small number of postsynaptic receptors. The prediction is not robust.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The interpretation contradicts the PPR data, and the prediction for the first control experiment is factually incorrect and logically reversed.\n\nFinal evaluation confirms that Option A provides the most accurate interpretation of the data and proposes two distinct, powerful, and correctly interpreted experiments to resolve the precise mechanistic ambiguity highlighted in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2722378"}]}
