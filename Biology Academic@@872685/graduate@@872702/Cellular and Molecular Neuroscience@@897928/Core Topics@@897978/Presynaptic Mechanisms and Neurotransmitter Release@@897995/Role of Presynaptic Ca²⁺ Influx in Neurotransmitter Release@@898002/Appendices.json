It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. The task is to derive the Nernst potential for a specific ion, Ca$^{2+}$, and then to calculate its value under given physiological conditions.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the equilibrium potential. The fundamental principle is that at equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane. This condition is met when the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$, for an ionic species in a solution is the sum of its chemical potential, $\\mu$, and the electrical potential energy per mole.\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu} = \\mu + zFV $$\nHere, $z$ is the valence (charge) of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant ($96485.33212$ C mol$^{-1}$), and $V$ is the electrical potential.\n\nThe chemical potential, $\\mu$, for an ideal dilute solution is given by:\n$$ \\mu = \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln[C] $$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant ($8.314462618$ J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$), $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and $[C]$ is the molar concentration of the ion.\n\nFor equilibrium to exist for an ion across a membrane, its electrochemical potential must be the same in the intracellular fluid and the extracellular fluid.

A positive change indicates that the driving force has become less negative (i.e., it has increased algebraically, moving closer to zero).\n\n**Part (ii): Ratio of Calcium Currents**\n\nThe calcium current, $I_{Ca}$, is given by the linear relation $I_{Ca} = g_{Ca}(V - E_{Ca})$. We must compute the ratio of the current at $V_{\\text{final}} = 0 \\text{ mV}$ to the current at $V_{\\text{initial}} = -10 \\text{ mV}$.\n\nThe initial current, $I_{Ca}(-10 \\text{ mV})$, is:\n$$\nI_{Ca}(-10 \\text{ mV}) = g_{Ca} (V_{\\text{initial}} - E_{Ca}) = g_{Ca} (-10 \\text{ mV} - 120 \\text{ mV}) = g_{Ca} (-130 \\text{ mV})\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates an inward current (influx of positive $Ca^{2+}$ ions), as expected for a membrane potential far below the calcium reversal potential.\n\nThe final current, $I_{Ca}(0 \\text{ mV})$, is:\n$$\nI_{Ca}(0 \\text{ mV}) = g_{Ca} (V_{\\text{final}} - E_{Ca}) = g_{Ca} (0 \\text{ mV} - 120 \\text{ mV}) = g_{Ca} (-120 \\text{ mV})\n$$\nThe problem stipulates that $g_{Ca}$ is constant across these two voltages.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The specified distances are physiologically realistic for synaptic active zones.\n\nWe shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the instantaneous vesicle fusion rate be denoted by $R$ and the local calcium concentration by $C(r)$, where $r$ is the distance from the calcium channel.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have two fundamental proportionalities. First, the calcium concentration is inversely proportional to the distance from the channel:\n$$C(r) \\propto \\frac{1}{r}$$\nThis can be written as an equation with a constant of proportionality, $k_1$:\n$$C(r) = \\frac{k_1}{r}$$\n\nSecond, the vesicle fusion rate is proportional to the $n$-th power of the local calcium concentration:\n$$R \\propto [C(r)]^n$$\nThis can be written with another constant of proportionality, $k_2$:\n$$R(r) = k_2 [C(r)]^n$$\n\nWe are given that the cooperativity exponent is $n=4$. Substituting this value:\n$$R(r) = k_2 [C(r)]^4$$\n\nNow, we can combine these two relationships by substituting the expression for $C(r)$ into the equation for $R(r)$:\n$$R(r) = k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_1}{r}\\right)^4 = \\frac{k_2 k_1^4}{r^4}$$\nThe term $k_2 k_1^4$ is a constant. Let us define a new composite constant $K = k_2 k_1^4$. The relationship between the fusion rate and distance is thus:\n$$R(r) = \\frac{K}{r^4}$$\nThis demonstrates that the vesicle fusion rate is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance from the calcium source. This is a profound result, indicating extreme sensitivity of synaptic release to the precise spatial arrangement of channels and vesicles.\n\nWe are asked to compute the fold-change in the rate when the distance is changed from $r_1 = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $r_2 = 40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.
