It describes a classical model of quantal neurotransmitter release at a chemical synapse, a fundamental concept in cellular and molecular neuroscience. The parameters and assumptions given are standard and sufficient for a unique solution. I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\n1) Derivation of the expected Excitatory Postsynaptic Current (EPSC) amplitude.\n\nThe problem states that the presynaptic active zone has $N$ independent release sites. The release of a vesicle at any given site $i$ (for $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$) is a random event. We can model this with a set of random variables. Let $X_i$ be the random variable for release at site $i$, such that:\n$$\nX_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if a vesicle is released} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if no vesicle is released} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that these events are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials with a success probability of $p$. Therefore, the probability mass function for each $X_i$ is $P(X_i=1) = p$ and $P(X_i=0) = 1-p$.\n\nThe current generated by a single release event is $q$. Thus, the current contributed by site $i$ is $q \\cdot X_i$. The total EPSC amplitude, which we shall denote as $I$, is the linear sum of the currents from all $N$ sites:\n$$\nI = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} q \\cdot X_i\n$$\nWe are asked to find the expected EPSC amplitude, $E[I]$. Using the expression for $I$:\n$$\nE[I] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} q \\cdot X_i\\right]\n$$\nSince $q$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\nE[I] = q \\cdot E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right]\n$$\nThe problem explicitly requires the use of the linearity of expectation. This property states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations, regardless of whether they are independent. Applying this property:\n$$\nE[I] = q \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]\n$$\nNow, we must find the expectation of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$. By definition, the expected value is:\n$$\nE[X_i] = (1) \\cdot P(X_i=1) + (0) \\cdot P(X_i=0) = (1) \\cdot p + (0) \\cdot (1-p) = p\n$$\nSince the release events are identically distributed, the expectation $E[X_i]$ is equal to $p$ for all sites from $i=1$ to $N$. Substituting this result back into the sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p = Np\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this sum back into the expression for the expected total current, $E[I]$:\n$$\nE[I] = q \\cdot (Np) = Npq\n$$\nThis is the expression for the expected EPSC amplitude based on the given assumptions and derived using the linearity of expectation.\n\n2) Calculation of the fold-change and interpretation.\n\nThe baseline expected EPSC amplitude, which we denote $E_{base}$, is given by the expression derived above:\n$$\nE_{base} = Npq\n$$\nAn experimental manipulation alters the number of release sites and the per-site release probability.

The synapse has $N$ independent and identical functional release sites.\n$2$. Upon arrival of an action potential, each site releases a single synaptic vesicle with probability $p$. No site releases more than one vesicle (univesicular release).\n$3$. The number of released vesicles, $k$, in a given trial follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim B(N, p)$.\n$4$. Each vesicle release contributes a quantal current of size $q$ to the total postsynaptic current, $I$.\n$5$.

The total observed variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(I)$, is the sum of these two, as they are independent:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(I) = \\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) + \\sigma_{b}^{2} $$\nThe synaptic variance is related to the variance of $k$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) = \\mathrm{Var}(k \\cdot q) = q^2 \\mathrm{Var}(k) = q^2 Np(1-p) $$\n\nTo perform mean-variance analysis, we must express the synaptic variance as a function of the mean current. We can rearrange the synaptic variance equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) = q(Npq) - q^2 Np^2 = q(Npq) - \\frac{(Npq)^2}{N} $$\nSubstituting $\\langle I \\rangle = Npq$, we obtain the parabolic relationship:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) = q\\langle I \\rangle - \\frac{\\langle I \\rangle^2}{N} $$\nThis equation describes a parabola opening downwards for a plot of $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I)$ versus $\\langle I \\rangle$. The parameters $N$ and $q$ are constant across different extracellular calcium concentrations, whereas $p$, and consequently $\\langle I \\rangle$ and $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I)$, vary.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- Quantal size: $q = 10~\\mathrm{pA}$.\n- Baseline noise variance: $\\sigma_{b}^{2} = 100~\\mathrm{pA}^{2}$.\n- Experimental measurements at three calcium concentrations:\n  $1$.

At $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{o} = 2~\\mathrm{mM}$: $\\langle I_2 \\rangle = 100~\\mathrm{pA}$, $\\mathrm{Var}(I_2) = 700~\\mathrm{pA}^{2}$.\n  $3$. At $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{o} = 4~\\mathrm{mM}$: $\\langle I_3 \\rangle = 175~\\mathrm{pA}$, $\\mathrm{Var}(I_3) = 625~\\mathrm{pA}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the synaptic variance for each condition by subtracting the background noise:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) = \\mathrm{Var}(I) - \\sigma_{b}^{2} $$\n- For condition $1$: $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I_1) = 500 - 100 = 400~\\mathrm{pA}^{2}$.\n- For condition $2$: $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I_2) = 700 - 100 = 600~\\mathrm{pA}^{2}$.\n- For condition $3$: $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I_3) = 625 - 100 = 525~\\mathrm{pA}^{2}$.\n\nWe now have three points $(\\langle I \\rangle, \\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I))$ that must lie on the parabola defined by $q$ and $N$: $(50, 400)$, $(100, 600)$, and $(175, 525)$. We are given $q=10~\\mathrm{pA}$. We can use any data point to solve for $N$. Let us use the first point:\n$$ 400 = (10)(50) - \\frac{(50)^2}{N} $$\n$$ 400 = 500 - \\frac{2500}{N} $$\n$$ \\frac{2500}{N} = 500 - 400 = 100 $$\n$$ N = \\frac{2500}{100} = 25 $$\nThe number of functional release sites is $N=25$. To ensure correctness, we must verify this result using the other data points.\nFor the second point $(\\langle I_2 \\rangle = 100)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I_2) = (10)(100) - \\frac{(100)^2}{25} = 1000 - \\frac{10000}{25} = 1000 - 400 = 600~\\mathrm{pA}^{2}$$\nThis matches the experimental data.\nFor the third point $(\\langle I_3 \\rangle = 175)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I_3) = (10)(175) - \\frac{(175)^2}{25} = 1750 - \\frac{30625}{25} = 1750 - 1225 = 525~\\mathrm{pA}^{2}$$\nThis also matches the experimental data. The data are internally consistent with the binomial model for $N=25$ and $q=10~\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nThe problem next asks for the release probability $p$ at $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{o} = 4~\\mathrm{mM}$. This corresponds to the third condition, where $\\langle I_3 \\rangle = 175~\\mathrm{pA}$. We use the equation for the mean current:\n$$ \\langle I_3 \\rangle = N p_3 q $$\n$$ 175 = (25) \\cdot p_3 \\cdot (10) $$\n$$ 175 = 250 \\cdot p_3 $$\n$$ p_3 = \\frac{175}{250} = \\frac{7}{10} = 0.7 $$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. Thus, $N=25.0$ and $p=0.700$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for a qualitative explanation of how structural heterogeneity would bias these estimates. The assumed model is homogeneous, with uniform quantal size $q$ and release probability $p$ across all $N$ sites.\n\n$1$. **Heterogeneity in release probability ($p_i$)**: If release probabilities vary across sites (e.g., due to different coupling distances between release sites and calcium channels), while quantal size remains uniform, the synaptic variance for a given mean current is reduced. The variance for a heterogeneous set of probabilities $\\{p_i\\}$ is $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) = q^2 N(\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) - \\sigma_p^2)$, where $\\bar{p}$ is the mean probability and $\\sigma_p^2$ is its variance. This is lower than the variance for a homogeneous synapse with probability $\\bar{p}$. The mean-variance parabola is shifted downwards. When fitting this reduced-variance data to a homogeneous model, the curvature of the parabola appears less pronounced than it should for the true number of sites. This leads to an **underestimation of the number of sites $N$**.\n\n$2$. **Heterogeneity in quantal size ($q_i$)**: If quantal sizes vary across sites (e.g., due to differences in vesicle-filling or postsynaptic receptor density), while release probability $p$ is uniform, the effective quantal size and the variance are both inflated. The mean-variance relationship becomes $\\mathrm{Var}_{syn}(I) \\approx \\bar{q}(1+CV_q^2)\\langle I \\rangle - \\frac{(1+CV_q^2)}{N}\\langle I \\rangle^2$, where $\\bar{q}$ is the mean quantal size and $CV_q$ is its coefficient of variation. The analysis would estimate an apparent quantal size $q_{est} = \\bar{q}(1+CV_q^2)$ from the initial slope, which is an overestimation of the true mean $\\bar{q}$. Simultaneously, it would estimate the number of sites as $N_{est} = N/(1+CV_q^2)$, which is an **underestimation of the true number of sites $N$**.\n\nIn summary, both forms of heterogeneity described would lead to an underestimation of the number of functional release sites $N$ when analyzed with a simple, homogeneous binomial model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n25.0 & 0.700\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2739534"}, {"introduction": "The release probability ($p$) is not merely an abstract value; it is critically dependent on the precise nanoscale architecture of the active zone, specifically the coupling distance between voltage-gated Ca$^{2+}$ channels and the Ca$^{2+}$ sensors on synaptic vesicles.

The assumptions provided (negligible endogenous buffering) are standard simplifications for creating a tractable \"first-principles\" model of this phenomenon. The problem is solvable and not trivial, requiring an understanding of the competition between diffusion and chemical reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem describes a competition between two processes for a single $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion after it enters the presynaptic terminal through a channel:\n1.  Diffusion over a distance $r$ to bind to the release sensor (e.g., Synaptotagmin-1).\n2.  Capture by a mobile exogenous buffer (chelator) present in the cytoplasm.\n\nThe effectiveness of a chelator in suppressing release depends on its ability to intercept the $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion before it reaches the sensor. This can be analyzed by comparing the characteristic time for diffusion, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, to the characteristic time for capture by the buffer, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{capture}}$.\n\nThe diffusion time for a particle to travel a distance $r$ in three dimensions can be approximated as $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx r^2 / (6D_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}})$, although the precise numerical factor is not critical for this estimation. What matters is the scaling, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\propto r^2$.\n\nThe capture of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by a buffer $B$ is a second-order reaction. Given that the buffer concentration $[B]$ is high and relatively constant, the reaction behaves as a pseudo-first-order process with a rate constant $k' = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[B]$. The characteristic time for a $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion to be captured is the inverse of this rate:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{capture}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[B]} $$\n\nA more rigorous approach, which combines these two concepts, is to calculate the characteristic buffering length, $\\lambda$. This length scale represents the average distance a $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion diffuses before being captured by the buffer. It is derived from the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation and is given by:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[B]}} $$\nIf the channel-sensor distance $r$ is much smaller than $\\lambda$ ($r \\ll \\lambda$), the $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion is highly likely to reach the sensor before being captured, and the buffer will be ineffective. If $r$ is much larger than $\\lambda$ ($r \\gg \\lambda$), the ion is likely to be captured before reaching the sensor, and the buffer will be effective.\n\nLet us calculate $\\lambda$ for both EGTA and BAPTA using the provided data.

This implies that the coupling distance $r$ must be significantly smaller than the characteristic buffering length of EGTA.\n    $$ r \\ll \\lambda_{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\implies r \\ll 148\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\n2.  **BAPTA ($5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) causes a massive $85\\%$ decrease in release.** This indicates that BAPTA is highly effective at intercepting $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions. This implies that the coupling distance $r$ must be comparable to, or larger than, the characteristic buffering length of BAPTA. A strong block suggests $r > \\lambda_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}}$.\n    $$ r \\gtrsim \\lambda_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\implies r \\gtrsim 10.5\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\n\nCombining these two conditions gives us the estimated range for the coupling distance $r$:\n$$ 10.5\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\lesssim r \\ll 148\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nThe distance must be greater than approximately $10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ but substantially less than $150\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This coupling arrangement, where the sensor is located tens of nanometers from the channel mouth, is known as a **nanodomain** signaling regime.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this derived range.\n\n**A. Tight nanodomain coupling with $r \\approx 20$–$50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, implying channel–sensor colocalization within a single vesicle release site scaffold.**\nThis range, $r \\in [20, 50]\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, satisfies our derived conditions perfectly. A distance of $20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is much less than $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 148\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, explaining why EGTA is ineffective. It is also greater than $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 10.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, explaining why BAPTA is very effective. This is the definition of tight nanodomain coupling.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Loose microdomain coupling with $r \\approx 150$–$250\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, implying release driven by the summed Ca$^{2+}$ microdomain of multiple channels.**\nIf $r$ were in this range, for example $r = 150\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, then $r$ would be comparable to $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 148\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. In this scenario, EGTA should have been a potent blocker of release, contrary to the observation of only a $5\\%$ reduction. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Ultra-tight coupling with $r \\lesssim 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, implying that even fast chelators cannot intercept Ca$^{2+}$ before it reaches the sensor.**\nIf $r$ were less than or approximately equal to $10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, it would be comparable to or smaller than $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 10.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. In this case, BAPTA would not be able to effectively intercept the $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions, and the observed block of release ($85\\%$) would be much smaller. The strong effect of BAPTA rules out this ultra-tight coupling distance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Spatially averaged regime with $r \\gtrsim 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, implying release depends on global Ca$^{2+}$ elevations rather than local domains.**\nA distance of $r \\gtrsim 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is much larger than both $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 148\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 10.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. In such a regime, both chelators would be extremely effective at buffering $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ before it reaches the sensor. The fact that $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA has almost no effect completely falsifies this hypothesis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option consistent with a first-principles analysis of reaction-diffusion competition is A.
