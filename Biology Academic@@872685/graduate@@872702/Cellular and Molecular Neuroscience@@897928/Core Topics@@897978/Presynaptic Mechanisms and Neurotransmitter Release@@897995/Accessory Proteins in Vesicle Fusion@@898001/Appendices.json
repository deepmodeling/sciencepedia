The principle of mass conservation provides two additional equations:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [R] + [RL]$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [L] + [RL]$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, defined as:\n$$\\theta \\equiv \\frac{[RL]}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\n\nTo solve for $[RL]$, we first express the concentrations of the free species, $[R]$ and $[L]$, in terms of the total concentrations and the concentration of the complex, $[RL]$. From the conservation equations, we have:\n$$[R] = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL]$$\n$$[L] = L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL]$$\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions for $[R]$ and $[L]$ into the equation for the dissociation constant:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL])(L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL])}{[RL]}$$\n\nThis equation must be solved for $[RL]$. We rearrange it into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where the variable $x$ is $[RL]$.\n$$K_{d}[RL] = (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL])(L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RL])$$\n$$K_{d}[RL] = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}} - R_{\\mathrm{tot}}[RL] - L_{\\mathrm{tot}}[RL] + [RL]^2$$\n$$0 = [RL]^2 - (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})[RL] + R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $[RL]$. The solution is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nwith coefficients $a=1$, $b = -(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})$, and $c = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nSubstituting these coefficients, we get:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d}) \\pm \\sqrt{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})^2 - 4R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}}}{2}$$\n\nThis equation yields two mathematical solutions. We must select the one that is physically meaningful. The concentration of the complex, $[RL]$, cannot exceed the total concentration of either of its constituents, i.e., $[RL] \\leq R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $[RL] \\leq L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. Let us examine the value of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 - (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})x + R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ at $x = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$f(R_{\\mathrm{tot}}) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 - (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_{d})R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n$$f(R_{\\mathrm{tot}}) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 - R_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 - L_{\\mathrm{tot}}R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - K_{d}R_{\\mathrm{tot}} + R_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = -K_{d}R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\nSince $K_{d} > 0$ and $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} > 0$, $f(R_{\\mathrm{tot}})  0$.

Because $f(R_{\\mathrm{tot}})$ is negative, one root of the quadratic equation must be less than $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and the other must be greater than $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The larger root is therefore physically impossible, as it would imply creating more complex than the total amount of available reactant.

This is mathematically expressed as:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dom}} = \\max(\\tau_1, \\tau_2) = \\max\\left(\\frac{1}{k_u}, \\frac{1}{k_f}\\right)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to taking the reciprocal of the smaller of the two rate constants, which represents the rate-limiting step in the sequence.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dom}} = \\frac{1}{\\min(k_u, k_f)}\n$$\nWe will now apply this formula to each of the five specified parameter sets. The given rates $k_u$ and $k_f$ are in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, so $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ will be calculated in seconds. The result must then be converted to milliseconds ($1 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n\nCase 1: $(k_u, k_f) = (2000, 5000) \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nThe minimum rate is $\\min(2000, 5000) = 2000 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dom}} = \\frac{1}{2000} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.0005 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $0.500 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nCase 2: $(k_u, k_f) = (8000, 5000) \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nThe minimum rate is $\\min(8000, 5000) = 5000 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dom}} = \\frac{1}{5000} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.0002 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.2 \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $0.200 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nCase 3: $(k_u, k_f) = (500, 5000) \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nThe minimum rate is $\\min(500, 5000) = 500 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dom}} = \\frac{1}{500} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.002 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 2.0 \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $2.00 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nCase 4: $(k_u, k_f) = (10000, 1000) \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nThe minimum rate is $\\min(10000, 1000) = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dom}} = \\frac{1}{1000} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.001 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $1.00 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nCase 5: $(k_u, k_f) = (4000, 4000) \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nThe rates are equal, so the minimum rate is $4000 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dom}} = \\frac{1}{4000} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.00025 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.25 \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $0.250 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe sequence of results for the five cases is therefore $0.500$, $0.200$, $2.00$, $1.00$, and $0.250$, all in milliseconds.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dominant time constant for a vesicle fusion model\n    for a series of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains (k_u, k_f) in units of s^-1.\n    test_cases = [\n        (2000, 5000),  # Case 1\n        (8000, 5000),  # Case 2\n        (500, 5000),   # Case 3\n        (10000, 1000), # Case 4\n        (4000, 4000),  # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    def format_to_sf(value, sf):\n        \"\"\"\n        Formats a number to a specified number of significant figures,\n        preserving trailing zeros, which is crucial for scientific representation.\n        \"\"\"\n        if value == 0:\n            return f\"{0:.{sf-1}f}\"\n        \n        # Calculate the order of magnitude to determine the decimal places needed for formatting.\n        order_of_magnitude = math.floor(math.log10(abs(value)))\n        # The number of decimal places for the format specifier is derived from\n        # the desired significant figures and the number's magnitude.\n        decimal_places = sf - 1 - order_of_magnitude\n        \n        # Ensure decimal_places is not negative for the f-string format specifier.\n        if decimal_places  0:\n             # This handles cases where rounding occurs to the left of the decimal point,\n             # although not expected for this problem's data range.\n             # We scale, round to integer, then un-scale.\n             scale = 10**(-decimal_places)\n             rounded_value = int(round(value / scale) * scale)\n             return f\"{rounded_value}\"\n        else:\n             return f\"{value:.{decimal_places}f}\"\n\n    results = []\n    for k_u, k_f in test_cases:\n        # The dominant time constant is the inverse of the minimum rate (the rate-limiting step).\n        # Rates are in s^-1, so the result is in seconds.\n        min_rate = np.min([k_u, k_f])\n        tau_dom_s = 1.0 / min_rate\n\n        # Convert the time constant from seconds to milliseconds.\n        tau_dom_ms = tau_dom_s * 1000\n\n        # Format the result to three significant figures.\n        formatted_result = format_to_sf(tau_dom_ms, 3)\n        results.append(formatted_result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2695631"}]}
