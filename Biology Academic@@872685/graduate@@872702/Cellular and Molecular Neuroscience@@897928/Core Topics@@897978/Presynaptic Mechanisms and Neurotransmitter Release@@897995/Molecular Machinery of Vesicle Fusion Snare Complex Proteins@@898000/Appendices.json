A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe rate constant for vesicle fusion is given by the expression $k(T) = k_0 \\exp(-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/(RT))$. We must consider two cases: fusion in the absence of SNARE catalysis ($k_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}$) and fusion in its presence ($k_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}$).\n\nLet $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}$ be the molar Gibbs free energy of activation for uncatalyzed membrane fusion, and let $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}$ be the corresponding quantity for SNARE-catalyzed fusion. The respective rate constants are:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}} = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}}{RT}\\right) $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{SNARE}} = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nThe prefactor $k_0$ is stated to be the same in both cases.\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in the fusion rate, which is the ratio $k_{\\mathrm{SNARE}} / k_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}$. We can write this ratio as:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{k_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}} = \\frac{k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{RT}\\right)}{k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThe prefactor $k_0$ cancels. Using the property of exponents $\\exp(a)/\\exp(b) = \\exp(a-b)$, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{k_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nThe term $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}$ represents the reduction in the molar activation energy due to SNARE catalysis. Let us denote this reduction as $\\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger})$.\n\nThe problem states that the SNARE complex lowers the activation barrier by an amount equal to $10\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ *per fusing vesicle–target membrane pair*. This is the reduction in the activation free energy on a single-particle (or single-event) level. Let this be $\\delta\\varepsilon^{\\ddagger}$.\n$$ \\delta\\varepsilon^{\\ddagger} = 10\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}} T $$\nThe molar Gibbs free energy of activation, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, is the per-particle energy, $\\varepsilon^{\\ddagger}$, multiplied by Avogadro's constant, $N_A$. Therefore, the reduction in the molar activation energy is:\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}) = N_A \\cdot \\delta\\varepsilon^{\\ddagger} = N_A \\cdot (10\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}} T) $$\nNow, we substitute this expression back into the exponent of our ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{k_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{N_A \\cdot 10\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{R T}\\right) $$\nThe universal gas constant $R$ is, by definition, the product of the Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and Avogadro's constant $N_A$:\n$$ R = N_A k_{\\mathrm{B}} $$\nSubstituting this fundamental relation into our expression:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{k_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{10 \\cdot (N_A k_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\cdot T}{(N_A k_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\cdot T}\\right) $$\nAll terms in the exponent cancel out except for the dimensionless factor of $10$:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{SNARE}}}{k_{\\mathrm{no\\;SNARE}}} = \\exp(10) $$\nIt is important to note that the temperature $T$ cancels from the final expression. Thus, the specific value of $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is redundant information, included perhaps to test for conceptual clarity over rote substitution of values. The fold-change is independent of temperature under the assumptions given.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\exp(10) \\approx 22026.46579... $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant digits are $2$, $2$, and $0$. The fourth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe value is $22000$.

A defining architectural feature is the central $0$-layer, which in the wild type consists of one positively charged arginine from the R-SNARE (VAMP2) and three glutamines from the Q-SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25), forming a polar hydrogen-bonding network within an otherwise hydrophobic core.

A rigorous, principle-based approach is required.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of protein biophysics and cellular neuroscience. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests on understanding the biophysical properties of the SNARE complex's central $0$-layer. This layer is situated within the hydrophobic interior of the $4$-helix bundle.\n\n**1. Analysis of SNARE Complex Stability ($\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$)**\n\nThe equilibrium stability of the protein complex is quantified by the Gibbs free energy of folding and association, $\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$. A more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$ corresponds to a more stable complex.\n\n- **Wild-Type ($3$Q:$1$R) Complex:** The wild-type $0$-layer consists of three glutamine (Q) residues and one arginine (R) residue. Arginine is a large amino acid with a positively charged guanidinium group. Glutamine is polar but uncharged. Placing a formal charge, like that of arginine, into a low-dielectric, hydrophobic environment incurs a significant electrostatic energy penalty (a desolvation penalty). While this penalty is partially mitigated by the formation of hydrogen bonds with the three surrounding polar glutamine residues, an unfavorable electrostatic interaction remains. In fact, this so-called \"ionic layer\" is a point of structural strain and electrostatic frustration, and it *destabilizes* the complex relative to a hypothetical purely hydrophobic layer. It is a key functional feature, not an optimal one for stability alone.\n\n- **Mutant ($4$Q) Complex:** The R$\\to$Q mutation replaces the single charged arginine with a fourth glutamine. The resulting $4$Q layer is composed entirely of polar, uncharged residues. This configuration eliminates the large energetic penalty associated with burying an uncompensated charge in the hydrophobic core. The four glutamine side chains can arrange into a highly favorable, planar, and symmetric hydrogen-bonding network. This arrangement is significantly more stable from an electrostatic and steric perspective than the asymmetric and charged $3$Q:$1$R configuration.\n\n- **Conclusion on Stability:** By replacing the electrostatically unfavorable arginine with a neutral glutamine, the mutation relieves the inherent strain in the $0$-layer. This leads to a thermodynamically more stable complex. Therefore, the $\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$ for the $4$Q mutant is more negative than that of the wild-type $3$Q:$1$R complex. In other words, the mutation **increases** the stability of the SNARE complex.\n\n**2. Analysis of NSF/$\\alpha$-SNAP-Mediated Disassembly Rate**\n\nThe disassembly of the post-fusion *cis*-SNARE complex is an active process catalyzed by the AAA+ ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and its cofactor, $\\alpha$-SNAP. This machinery uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to apply mechanical force to the N-termini of the SNARE helices, processively unzippering the complex.\n\n- **Relationship between Stability and Disassembly Rate:** The rate of any chemical or biochemical process, including protein unfolding, is governed by the height of the activation energy barrier ($\\Delta G^\\ddagger$). The stability of the initial state (the folded *cis*-SNARE complex, with free energy $\\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}$) is a primary contributor to this barrier. A more stable complex has a lower ground-state free energy, which, all else being equal, increases the energy required to reach the transition state for unfolding.\n\n- **Effect of the Mutation:** As established in the first part of our analysis, the $4$Q mutant complex is significantly more stable than the wild-type complex. This increased thermodynamic stability translates directly into increased kinetic resistance to forced unfolding. The NSF/$\\alpha$-SNAP machinery must expend more energy or time to disrupt the highly stable, symmetric hydrogen bond network of the $4$Q layer compared to the strained, less stable $3$Q:$1$R layer of the wild-type complex.\n\n- **Conclusion on Disassembly Rate:** Because the $4$Q mutant complex is more stable, it presents a higher activation energy barrier for disassembly by NSF/$\\alpha$-SNAP. Consequently, the rate of disassembly will be **slower** for the mutant complex compared to the wild-type.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n1.  SNARE complex stability: **Increases**.\n2.  NSF/$\\alpha$-SNAP-mediated disassembly rate: **Decreases (slows)**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against our derived conclusions.\n\n**A.
