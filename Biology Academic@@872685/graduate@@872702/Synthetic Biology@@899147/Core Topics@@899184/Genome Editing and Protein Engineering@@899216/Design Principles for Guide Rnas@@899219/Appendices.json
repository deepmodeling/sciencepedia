It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of biophysical chemistry, specifically the nearest-neighbor model for nucleic acid thermodynamics. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique, rigorous derivation. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present. We shall therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the total standard-state hybridization free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyb}}$, of an RNA-DNA duplex of length $L$. The derivation must begin from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nThe first principle is the relationship between the standard free energy change $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ and the equilibrium constant $K$ for a reaction:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = - R T \\ln K $$\nHere, $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For the hybridization reaction between the RNA spacer and the DNA target, this becomes $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = - R T \\ln K_{\\mathrm{hyb}}$, where $K_{\\mathrm{hyb}}$ is the equilibrium constant for duplex formation.\n\nThe second principle is the nearest-neighbor additivity, which, in a statistical mechanical framework, implies that the partition function of the duplex state, $Z_{\\mathrm{duplex}}$, is factorizable into local, independent contributions. The formation of a duplex of length $L$ can be conceptualized as a sequence of events: an initial nucleation or initiation step to form the first base pair, followed by $L-1$ propagation or stacking steps to form the complete duplex.\n\nLet the equilibrium constant for the initiation step be $K_{\\mathrm{init}}$. Let the equilibrium constant for the stacking at step $k$, which involves the dinucleotide from position $k$ to $k+1$, be $K_{\\mathrm{stack},k}$. Based on the assumption of independent nearest-neighbor interactions, the total equilibrium constant for hybridization is the product of the equilibrium constants for each of these sequential steps:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = K_{\\mathrm{init}} \\times \\prod_{k=1}^{L-1} K_{\\mathrm{stack},k} $$\nThis factorization is the direct consequence of the assumed factorizability of the partition function.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $K_{\\mathrm{hyb}}$ into the thermodynamic equation for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyb}}$ yields:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = - R T \\ln \\left( K_{\\mathrm{init}} \\times \\prod_{k=1}^{L-1} K_{\\mathrm{stack},k} \\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(a^n) = n\\ln(a)$, we can expand this expression into a sum of free-energy terms:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = - R T \\ln(K_{\\mathrm{init}}) - R T \\ln \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{L-1} K_{\\mathrm{stack},k} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = - R T \\ln(K_{\\mathrm{init}}) - R T \\sum_{k=1}^{L-1} \\ln(K_{\\mathrm{stack},k}) $$\nWe now define the free energy contribution of each step. The initiation free energy is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{init}} = - R T \\ln(K_{\\mathrm{init}})$. The stacking free energy for the step at position $k$ is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{stack},k} = - R T \\ln(K_{\\mathrm{stack},k})$. With these definitions, the total hybridization free energy becomes an additive sum:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{init}} + \\sum_{k=1}^{L-1} \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{stack},k} $$\nThis equation is the formal statement of free energy additivity in the nearest-neighbor model.\n\nThe final step is to express $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{stack},k}$ in terms of the specific parameters given in the problem. The model provides a library of dinucleotide-step free energy parameters, $\\Delta G_{ij}$, where the index $i$ corresponds to the RNA dinucleotide category and $j$ to the DNA dinucleotide category for a given step. The identity of the step at position $k$ is given by the indicator variables $x_{ij}^{(k)}$, which is defined to be $1$ if the step at $k$ is of category $(i,j)$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nFor any given step $k$, only one specific pair of dinucleotide categories $(i,j)$ will be present. Therefore, the stacking free energy for that step, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{stack},k}$, is precisely the value $\\Delta G_{ij}$ corresponding to that specific category pair. We can write this selection process formally as a weighted sum over all possible categories. Since for each $k$, exactly one $x_{ij}^{(k)}$ is $1$ and all others are $0$ (guaranteed by the constraint $\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} x_{ij}^{(k)} = 1$), this sum correctly isolates the single relevant term:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{stack},k} = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} x_{ij}^{(k)} \\Delta G_{ij} $$\nThis expression holds for each stacking step $k$ from $1$ to $L-1$.\n\nBy substituting this expression for the stacking free energy of a single step back into the equation for the total hybridization free energy, we arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{init}} + \\sum_{k=1}^{L-1} \\left( \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} x_{ij}^{(k)} \\Delta G_{ij} \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the total standard-state hybridization free energy as the sum of a constant initiation term and the sum of stacking free energies over all $L-1$ dinucleotide steps, where each step's contribution is determined by the specific RNA and DNA dinucleotides involved.
