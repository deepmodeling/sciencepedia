In steady-state exponential growth, the fraction of time that the promoter is occupied by the dCas9–sgRNA complex can be approximated by the equilibrium fractional occupancy of the binding site by the complex. Assume one-to-one binding between the dCas9–sgRNA complex and the target site, negligible sequestration by off-target sites, and that time-averaged occupancy equals equilibrium occupancy.\n\nYou perform a Western blot with a purified dCas9 standard, obtaining a linear calibration between band intensity and mass of dCas9: intensity $I$ (arbitrary units) equals slope $\\beta$ times mass $m$ (in ng), that is $I = \\beta\\, m$.

The problem will be addressed by first validating its premises and then proceeding with a systematic solution.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium (the law of mass action) and standard techniques in molecular and quantitative biology (Western blotting, CRISPRi). The provided data are dimensionally consistent and physically plausible for a bacterial system. The simplifying assumption that the free concentration of the dCas9-sgRNA complex is approximately equal to its total concentration is explicitly stated and is a standard, justifiable approximation in systems where the ligand (dCas9 complex) is in vast excess of the receptor (promoter target site). The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the equilibrium fractional occupancy, $\\theta$. The binding of the dCas9-sgRNA complex, which we will denote as $C$, to the promoter target site, $P$, can be represented by the reversible reaction:\n$$ P + C \\rightleftharpoons PC $$\nwhere $PC$ is the bound state of the promoter and the complex.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[P]_{\\text{free}} [C]_{\\text{free}}}{[PC]} $$\nwhere $[P]_{\\text{free}}$, $[C]_{\\text{free}}$, and $[PC]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the free promoter, free complex, and bound promoter, respectively.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total promoter sites that are occupied by the complex:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PC]}{[P]_{\\text{total}}} $$\nThe total concentration of the promoter, $[P]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of its free and bound forms:\n$$ [P]_{\\text{total}} = [P]_{\\text{free}} + [PC] $$\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we can express $[P]_{\\text{free}}$ as:\n$$ [P]_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{K_d [PC]}{[C]_{\\text{free}}} $$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation for the promoter gives:\n$$ [P]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{K_d [PC]}{[C]_{\\text{free}}} + [PC] = [PC] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[C]_{\\text{free}}} + 1 \\right) = [PC] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [C]_{\\text{free}}}{[C]_{\\text{free}}} \\right) $$\nNow, substituting this expression for $[P]_{\\text{total}}$ into the definition of $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PC]}{[PC] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [C]_{\\text{free}}}{[C]_{\\text{free}}} \\right)} = \\frac{[C]_{\\text{free}}}{[C]_{\\text{free}} + K_d} $$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy.\n\nNext, we must calculate the value of $[C]_{\\text{free}}$ from the experimental data. The problem states that we can assume $[C]_{\\text{free}}$ is approximately the total concentration of the loaded (active) dCas9-sgRNA complex, $[C]_{\\text{total, loaded}}$. This assumption is justified because the target promoter exists as a single copy per cell, meaning its concentration is extremely low compared to the typical expression levels of the dCas9 protein. The concentration of total promoter sites is $[P]_{\\text{total}} = (1 \\text{ site/cell}) / (N_A V_{\\text{cell}}) \\approx 1.66 \\times 10^{-9}$ M, which is orders of magnitude smaller than the dCas9 concentration we will calculate.\n\nWe proceed to calculate $[C]_{\\text{total, loaded}}$.\n1.

Calculate the average concentration of active dCas9-sgRNA complex within a single cell. This can be done by first finding the average moles of active complex per cell and then dividing by the cell volume.\n    The total mass $m_{\\text{dCas9}}$ was obtained from a lysate of $N_{\\text{cells}}$ cells. The average mass of dCas9 per cell is:\n    $$ m_{\\text{per cell}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{dCas9}}}{N_{\\text{cells}}} = \\frac{5.314 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ g}}{1.00 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ cells}} $$\n    The average moles of dCas9 per cell is this mass divided by the molar mass $M$:\n    $$ n_{\\text{per cell}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{per cell}}}{M} = \\frac{m_{\\text{dCas9}}}{M \\times N_{\\text{cells}}} = \\frac{5.314 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ g}}{(1.60 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ g/mol}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{7})} $$\n    Only a fraction, $f_{\\text{load}}$, of these dCas9 molecules are loaded with sgRNA and are active. So, the average moles of active complex per cell is:\n    $$ n_{\\text{complex, per cell}} = n_{\\text{per cell}} \\times f_{\\text{load}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{dCas9}} \\times f_{\\text{load}}}{M \\times N_{\\text{cells}}} $$\n    The concentration of this active complex, $[C]_{\\text{total, loaded}}$, is the number of moles per cell divided by the volume per cell, $V_{\\text{cell}}$:\n    $$ [C]_{\\text{total, loaded}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{complex, per cell}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{dCas9}} \\times f_{\\text{load}}}{M \\times N_{\\text{cells}} \\times V_{\\text{cell}}} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ [C]_{\\text{total, loaded}} = \\frac{(5.314 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ g}) \\times 0.80}{(1.60 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ g/mol}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{7}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ L})} $$\n    $$ [C]_{\\text{total, loaded}} = \\frac{4.2512 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ g}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ g} \\cdot \\text{L} / \\text{mol}} = 2.657 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ mol/L} $$\n    So, $[C]_{\\text{free}} \\approx 2.657 \\times 10^{-5}$ M.\n\n3.
