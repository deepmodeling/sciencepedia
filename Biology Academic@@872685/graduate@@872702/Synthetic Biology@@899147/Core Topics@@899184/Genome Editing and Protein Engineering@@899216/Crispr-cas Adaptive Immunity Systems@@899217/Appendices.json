This exercise explores the fundamental probabilistic constraints that govern self- versus non-self recognition in CRISPR-Cas systems. By building a model from first principles, you will derive the probability of a \"false positive\" self-targeting event, gaining a quantitative understanding of how factors like spacer length and Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) specificity are fine-tuned by evolution to minimize autoimmunity [@problem_id:2725171].", "problem": "A bacterial host uses Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) nuclease adaptive immunity that recognizes foreign DNA by exact complementarity to a spacer of length $L$ and requires a neighboring Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) of length $m$. To avoid autoimmunity, the host must not contain any genomic loci that both exactly match a spacer and possess a valid PAM. Consider a single circular chromosome of length $N$ nucleotides modeled as an independent and identically distributed sequence with nucleotide frequencies $\\mathbf{p}=(p_{\\mathrm{A}},p_{\\mathrm{C}},p_{\\mathrm{G}},p_{\\mathrm{T}})$, where $\\sum_{b \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{T}\\}} p_b = 1$. A newly acquired spacer is drawn independently from the same nucleotide distribution $\\mathbf{p}$. A PAM is defined position-specifically by a degeneracy pattern: for each PAM position $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,m\\}$, a set $S_i \\subseteq \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{T}\\}$ specifies the allowed nucleotides at that position. A genomic window of length $L+m$ is called self-targeting if its first $L$ nucleotides exactly match the spacer sequence and its next $m$ nucleotides satisfy the PAM degeneracy, that is, the $i$-th PAM position lies in $S_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,m\\}$.

The nuclease recognizes only the PAM downstream of the protospacer.\n    2. Distinct length-$L+m$ windows are treated as approximately independent trials.\n    3. The system is in a rare-event regime, justifying the Poisson approximation.\n- Objective: Derive a closed-form analytic expression for the false self-targeting rate, defined as the probability of at least one self-targeting window in the genome.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, representing a standard and simplified probabilistic model of CRISPR-Cas9 target recognition, a fundamental topic in synthetic biology. It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters ($N$, $L$, $m$, $\\mathbf{p}$, $\\{S_i\\}$) and modeling assumptions clearly defined. The language is objective and formal. The problem avoids all forms of invalidity: it is not factually unsound, is formalizable and relevant, is complete, is scientifically plausible under the given idealizations, and is well-structured.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A formal solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\nThe objective is to find the probability of at least one self-targeting site occurring in the genome. We will denote this probability as $P(\\text{self-target})$. This corresponds to $P(X \\ge 1)$, where $X$ is the random variable representing the total number of self-targeting sites in the genome.\n\nThe problem specifies using the Poisson approximation for rare events. According to this framework, if we have $K$ independent or weakly dependent trials, each with a small probability of success $p$, then the total number of successes can be modeled by a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = Kp$. The probability of observing at least one success is then $1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probability, let us call it $p_{st}$, that a single, randomly chosen genomic window of length $L+m$ is a self-targeting site. A window is self-targeting if two independent conditions are met:\n1.  Its first $L$ nucleotides (the protospacer) must exactly match the sequence of a newly acquired spacer.\n2.  Its next $m$ nucleotides must satisfy the PAM recognition criteria.\n\nLet us calculate the probability for each condition.\n\n**1. Probability of Spacer Match ($P_{\\text{spacer}}$)**\nThe spacer sequence and the genomic sequence are both drawn as i.i.d. sequences from the same nucleotide distribution $\\mathbf{p} = (p_{\\mathrm{A}}, p_{\\mathrm{C}}, p_{\\mathrm{G}}, p_{\\mathrm{T}})$. We need to find the probability that a specific $L$-mer in the genome matches a specific $L$-mer spacer. Consider a single position. A nucleotide in the genome matches a nucleotide in the spacer if they are both 'A', or both 'C', etc. Since the draws for the spacer and genome are independent, the probability of a match at a single position is:\n$$ P(\\text{match at 1 position}) = p_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{A}} + p_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{C}} + p_{\\mathrm{G}} \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{G}} + p_{\\mathrm{T}} \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{T}} = \\sum_{b \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{T}\\}} p_b^2 $$\nSince all $L$ positions in the protospacer-spacer alignment are independent trials, the probability that the entire $L$-nucleotide protospacer in the genomic window matches the spacer is:\n$$ P_{\\text{spacer}} = \\left( \\sum_{b \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{T}\\}} p_b^2 \\right)^L $$\n\n**2. Probability of a Valid PAM ($P_{\\text{PAM}}$)**\nThe PAM is of a fixed length $m$ and is defined by a position-specific degeneracy pattern $\\{S_i\\}_{i=1}^m$. For each position $i$ in the PAM sequence of the genomic window, the nucleotide must belong to the set $S_i$. The probability that a nucleotide at a given genomic position satisfies the constraint for PAM position $i$ is the sum of the frequencies of the allowed nucleotides:\n$$ P(\\text{valid nucleotide at PAM position } i) = \\sum_{b \\in S_i} p_b $$\nSince the nucleotides at each of the $m$ positions in the PAM are independent, the total probability of a randomly selected $m$-mer satisfying the PAM definition is the product of the probabilities for each position:\n$$ P_{\\text{PAM}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{b \\in S_i} p_b \\right) $$\n\n**3. Probability of a Single Self-Targeting Window ($p_{st}$)**\nThe protospacer region and the PAM region of the genomic window are adjacent and their sequences are determined by independent nucleotide draws. Therefore, the events of a spacer match and a PAM match are independent. The total probability $p_{st}$ for a single window to be self-targeting is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$ p_{st} = P_{\\text{spacer}} \\times P_{\\text{PAM}} = \\left( \\sum_{b \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{T}\\}} p_b^2 \\right)^L \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{b \\in S_i} p_b \\right) $$\n\n**4. Applying the Poisson Approximation**\nThe bacterial chromosome is circular with length $N$. There are $N$ possible starting positions for a window of length $L+m$. We treat these $N$ windows as $N$ approximately independent trials. The expected number of self-targeting windows in the entire genome, $\\lambda$, is the number of trials multiplied by the probability of success in a single trial:\n$$ \\lambda = N \\cdot p_{st} = N \\left( \\sum_{b \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{T}\\}} p_b^2 \\right)^L \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{b \\in S_i} p_b \\right) $$\nThe number of self-targeting windows $X$ is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$, i.e., $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$.\n\nThe false self-targeting rate is the probability of finding at least one such window, which is $P(X \\ge 1)$. This is complementary to finding zero such windows, $P(X=0)$. For a Poisson distribution, $P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$.\n$$ P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nTherefore, the false self-targeting rate is:\n$$ P(\\text{self-target}) = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nSubstituting the full expression for $\\lambda$, we arrive at the final closed-form expression for the false self-targeting rate.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 - \\exp\\left( -N \\left( \\sum_{b \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{T}\\}} p_b^2 \\right)^L \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{b \\in S_i} p_b \\right) \\right)} $$", "id": "2725171"}, {"introduction": "Beyond avoiding autoimmunity, the efficacy of a CRISPR-Cas system, whether natural or engineered, hinges on its specificity.

Consider a genome modeled as a random independent and identically distributed sequence over the four nucleotides with each nucleotide occurring with probability $1/4$, and ignore protospacer adjacent motif constraints and position-specific mismatch effects. Assume the genome has length $G$ nucleotides, so that there are exactly $G-n+1$ distinct length-$n$ windows (candidate protospacers) per strand; to simplify double-strandedness bookkeeping, take $G-n+1$ to denote the total number of independent candidate windows already accounting for both strands.\n\nStarting only from first principles of probability for independent Bernoulli trials and the definition of Hamming distance, derive a closed-form expression for the expected number of off-target sites as a function of $n$, $m$, and $G$ under the assumptions above.

Our goal is to derive a closed-form expression for the expected value of $X$, denoted $E[X]$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the total number of independent candidate protospacer windows to consider is $N = G - n + 1$. We can model the occurrence of an off-target site at each window using a set of indicator random variables.

This implies that the probability of any given window being an off-target site is the same for all windows. Let us denote this constant probability as $p_{ot} = P(X_i=1)$. The expression for the expected value simplifies to:\n$$\nE[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{ot} = N \\cdot p_{ot} = (G-n+1) p_{ot}\n$$\nThe central part of the problem is to determine the probability $p_{ot}$. An off-target site is defined as a protospacer of length $n$ whose sequence has a Hamming distance of at most $m$ from the ideal target sequence. The ideal target is the DNA sequence perfectly complementary to the guide RNA.\n\nWe model the process of checking for mismatches as a series of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, one for each nucleotide position in the potential protospacer. According to the model, the genome is a random sequence where each of the four nucleotides appears with an equal probability of $1/4$.
