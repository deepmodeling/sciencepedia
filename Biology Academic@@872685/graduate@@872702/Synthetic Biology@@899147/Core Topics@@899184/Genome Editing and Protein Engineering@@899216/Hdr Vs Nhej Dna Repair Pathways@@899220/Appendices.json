It is a standard, formalizable problem in chemical kinetics applied to molecular biology. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the System of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the rates of the two competing repair processes. The rate of change for each population is described as follows:\n\nThe population of unrepaired DSBs, $D(t)$, decreases as DSBs are repaired by either NHEJ or HDR. Since each repair event is a first-order process, the rate of repair is proportional to the number of available DSBs. The total rate of depletion of $D(t)$ is the sum of the rates of the two pathways.\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt} = - (\\text{rate of NHEJ}) - (\\text{rate of HDR}) = -k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}D(t) - k_{\\mathrm{HDR}}D(t)\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt} = -(k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} + k_{\\mathrm{HDR}})D(t)\n$$\nThe cumulative number of DSBs repaired by NHEJ, $N(t)$, increases at the rate that NHEJ events occur.\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}D(t)\n$$\nSimilarly, the cumulative number of DSBs repaired by HDR, $H(t)$, increases at the rate that HDR events occur.\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{HDR}}D(t)\n$$\nThus, we have the system of three linear first-order ODEs with initial conditions $D(0)=D_0$, $N(0)=0$, and $H(0)=0$.\n\n**Solution of the ODEs**\n\nFirst, we solve for $D(t)$. The equation for $D(t)$ is a simple exponential decay equation.

The initial DSB has \"blunt ends\", which are substrates that can be directly ligated by the NHEJ machinery (specifically, the DNA Ligase IV/XRCC$4$/XLF complex). The most minimal processing is therefore zero processing, leading to precise re-ligation and a deletion of $0$ base pairs. However, the NHEJ process is known to be error-prone in vivo, and slight degradation by nucleases or non-templated addition by polymerases can occur, frequently resulting in small insertions or deletions (indels) of $1$ to a few base pairs. Thus, a predominant outcome of very small indels, such as $1$–$2$ bp deletions, is a scientifically accurate representation of NHEJ repair of a blunt-ended break.\n\nNext, the dominant MMEJ pathway is determined by calculating the net free energy change, $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$, for each candidate pair of microhomology tracts. The pathway with the most negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$ will be the most favorable and thus dominant.\n\nThe total free energy change is the sum of the stabilizing energy from base pair annealing, $\\Delta G_{\\text{anneal}}$, and the destabilizing cost of resection, $\\Delta G_{\\text{resect}}$.\nLet $L$ be the length of the microhomology, $G$ be the number of GC pairs, and $A$ be the number of AT pairs, where $A = L - G$.

The number of AT pairs is $A = 6 - 5 = 1$.\n$$ \\Delta G_4 = (1)(-1.4) + (5)(-2.0) + (14)(0.5) = -1.4 - 10.0 + 7.0 = -4.4\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T $$\nThe associated deletion size is $14$ bp.\n\nComparing the total free energy changes:\n$\\Delta G_1 = -2.8\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$\n$\\Delta G_2 = -3.3\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$\n$\\Delta G_3 = -2.8\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$\n$\\Delta G_4 = -4.4\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$\n\nThe most negative free energy change is $\\Delta G_4 = -4.4\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$. Therefore, the MMEJ pathway is predicted to predominantly use Pair $4$. This pathway results in a deletion of size $R=14$ base pairs.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. NHEJ predominantly yields $1$–$2$ base-pair deletions; MMEJ predominantly yields a $14$ base-pair deletion by using Pair $4$ because its GC-rich $6$-base microhomology provides sufficient annealing free energy to outweigh the longer resection.\n- **NHEJ prediction**: The statement that NHEJ yields $1$–$2$ bp deletions is a biologically realistic outcome for the error-prone repair of a blunt DSB, consistent with the principle of \"minimizing\" processing.\n- **MMEJ prediction**: The prediction of a $14$ bp deletion by using Pair $4$ is correct, as my calculation shows that this pathway is the most energetically favorable ($\\Delta G_4 = -4.4\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$).\n- **Justification**: The justification is sound. The annealing energy of Pair $4$ is $\\Delta G_{\\text{anneal}} = -11.4\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, which is substantially more stabilizing than its resection cost of $\\Delta G_{\\text{resect}} = +7.0\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$. This net stabilization is greater than that of any other pair, confirming that the strong annealing energy outweighs the cost of a longer resection.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\nB. NHEJ predominantly yields $6$–$12$ base-pair deletions; MMEJ predominantly yields a $4$ base-pair deletion by using Pair $1$ because the shortest resection always dominates over longer, more stable microhomologies.\n- **NHEJ prediction**: Deletions of size $6$–$12$ bp are not characteristic of NHEJ, which minimizes end processing. Such large deletions are more typical of MMEJ. This part is incorrect.\n- **MMEJ prediction**: The prediction of a $4$ bp deletion via Pair $1$ is incorrect. My calculation shows Pair $1$ ($\\Delta G_1 = -2.8\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$) is less favorable than Pair $2$ and Pair $4$.\n- **Justification**: The assertion that the shortest resection \"always dominates\" is a false premise. The calculation explicitly shows that this is not the case; the trade-off with annealing energy is critical.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. NHEJ predominantly yields precise re-ligation with $0$ base-pair deletion; MMEJ predominantly yields a $12$ base-pair deletion by using Pair $3$ because annealing free energy saturates beyond $5$ base pairs, so longer microhomologies confer no additional benefit.\n- **NHEJ prediction**: A $0$ bp deletion is the ideal minimal-processing outcome and is a plausible interpretation of the problem statement. This part is reasonable on its own.\n- **MMEJ prediction**: The prediction of a $12$ bp deletion via Pair $3$ is incorrect. Pair $3$ ($\\Delta G_3 = -2.8\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$) is not the most favorable pathway.\n- **Justification**: The claim that \"annealing free energy saturates beyond $5$ base pairs\" is an unsubstantiated assumption introduced from outside the problem statement. The provided model is strictly additive and contains no saturation term.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. NHEJ predominantly yields $3$ base-pair deletions due to codon-phase biases; MMEJ predominantly yields a $7$ base-pair deletion by using Pair $2$ because GC content is irrelevant relative to distance.\n- **NHEJ prediction**: While codon-phase pressure exists for edits in coding sequences, it is a selective pressure on cell populations, not a fundamental mechanistic feature of the NHEJ machinery itself. It does not explain why NHEJ would *predominantly* yield $3$ bp deletions as a primary repair event across all contexts.\n- **MMEJ prediction**: The prediction of a $7$ bp deletion via Pair $2$ is incorrect, as Pair $4$ is more favorable.\n- **Justification**: The claim that \"GC content is irrelevant relative to distance\" directly contradicts the provided energetic model, which explicitly assigns a higher stabilization energy to GC pairs ($-2.0\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$) than to AT pairs ($-1.4\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2743123"}]}
