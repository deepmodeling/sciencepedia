The operator consists of two adjacent palindromic half-sites that together overlap the core promoter, such that any occupancy by the repressor excludes ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP) and blocks transcription initiation. Initially, the repressor is monomeric and can bind each half-site independently with the same binding free energy per half-site, denoted by $\\epsilon_{h}$, measured in units of $k_{B} T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The effective availability of the repressor in the cell is captured by the standard thermodynamic model with a nonspecific DNA reservoir of size $N_{ns}$ and a total number of repressor molecules $R$, such that the dimensionless concentration parameter is $\\rho \\equiv R/N_{ns}$. Assume $R \\ll N_{ns}$ so that $\\rho$ is small but finite. In the monomeric state, the operator can be in three types of repressor-bound configurations that exclude RNAP: left half-site occupied, right half-site occupied, or both half-sites occupied. \n\nYou then convert the repressor to a dimer by fusing a dimerization domain with dimerization free energy $\\Delta \\epsilon_{dim}$ (in units of $k_{B} T$). In the engineered dimeric design, repression occurs predominantly by a dimer that spans and binds both half-sites simultaneously; single-monomer binding to a half-site in this engineered design is negligible. Within the equilibrium statistical mechanics framework of transcriptional regulation, assume that the dimeric binding state to the two half-sites is equivalent to the two-monomer double-occupancy state acquiring an additional interaction free energy $\\Delta \\epsilon_{dim}$ when both subunits are present at the operator, so that the total binding free energy of the dimeric bound state is $2 \\epsilon_{h} + \\Delta \\epsilon_{dim}$.\n\nDefine the repression factor $\\mathcal{R}$ as the inverse of the fold-change in expression relative to the no-repressor reference, i.e., $\\mathcal{R} \\equiv 1/\\text{fold-change}$, which for a simple repression architecture equals $1$ plus the sum of the statistical weights of all repressor-bound states that exclude RNAP.
