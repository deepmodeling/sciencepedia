This corresponds to the probability that the random variable $K$ takes the value $1$. We can find this by substituting $k=1$ into the Poisson PMF:\n$$ f_{1}(\\lambda) = P(K=1) = \\frac{\\lambda^{1} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1!} $$\nSince $1! = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ f_{1}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nThis is the desired expression for the fraction of cells with a single integration event as a function of the MOI, $\\lambda$.\n\nPart 2: Determine $\\lambda^{\\star}$ and the maximal fraction $f_{1}(\\lambda^{\\star})$.\nTo find the value of $\\lambda$ that maximizes $f_{1}(\\lambda)$ for $\\lambda \\ge 0$, we must use differential calculus.

By linearity, the compensated vector for a double-positive cell $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\end{pmatrix}$ is the sum of the compensated signals from its constituent parts, $\\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ B \\end{pmatrix}$.\nLet $\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}}(A)$ be the compensated signal for $\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{pmatrix}A \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}}(B)$ be for $\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ B\\end{pmatrix}$.\nThen $\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}}(A) + \\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}}(B)$.\nFrom the single-stain controls, we have the relations:\n$(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_B = m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}} (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_A$\n$(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_A = m'_{\\mathrm{B}\\text{-only}} (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_B$\nThe total compensated signal is $\\begin{pmatrix} z_A \\\\ z_B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_A + (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_A \\\\ (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_B + (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_A + m'_{\\mathrm{B}\\text{-only}} (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_B \\\\ m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}} (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_A + (\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_B \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe quantities $(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_A$ and $(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_B$ are the \"unmixed\" components of the compensated signal.

We can solve for these quantities:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_A = \\frac{z_A - m'_{\\mathrm{B}\\text{-only}} z_B}{1 - m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}}m'_{\\mathrm{B}\\text{-only}}}\n$$\n$$\n(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_B = \\frac{z_B - m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}} z_A}{1 - m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}}m'_{\\mathrm{B}\\text{-only}}}\n$$\nThe ratio of these unmixed components, let's call it $K_{bio}$, is proportional to the true biological co-expression ratio $B/A$.\n$$\nK_{bio} = \\frac{(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{B}})_B}{(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathrm{A}})_A} = \\frac{z_B - m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}} z_A}{z_A - m'_{\\mathrm{B}\\text{-only}} z_B}\n$$\nThis leads to the following diagnostic criteria:\n1.  **Presence of mis-compensation**: Mis-compensation exists if the slopes measured from single-stained controls are non-zero. That is, $m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}} \\neq 0$ or $m'_{\\mathrm{B}\\text{-only}} \\neq 0$.\n2.  **Evidence of true biological co-expression**: For a given population of cells appearing in the double-positive quadrant $(z_A > 0, z_B > 0)$, one must calculate $K_{bio}$ for each cell using the slopes derived from single-stained controls. If this population represents true biological co-expression from a single genetic construct, the value of $K_{bio}$ should be positive and approximately constant across the population. $K_{bio} > 0$ indicates that after correcting for known compensation artifacts, there is still a positive correlation between the fluorophores.\n3.  **Apparent correlation as artifact**: If a population appears correlated in the $(z_A, z_B)$ plane but for which $K_{bio} \\approx 0$, it is an artifact caused by the mis-compensated A-only population being tilted into the positive quadrant (i.e., its B-component is entirely explained by the artifact slope $m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}}$). Conversely, if $1/K_{bio} \\approx 0$, it is an artifact of the mis-compensated B-only population.\n\n**4) Calculation of $\\hat{s}_{21}$**\n\nWe are given the following values: $s_{12} = 0.18$, $s_{21} = 0.09$, $\\hat{s}_{12} = 0.20$, and $m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}} = -0.05$.\nWe use the expression derived in part $1$:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}} = \\frac{s_{21} - \\hat{s}_{21}}{1 - \\hat{s}_{12}s_{21}}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\n-0.05 = \\frac{0.09 - \\hat{s}_{21}}{1 - (0.20)(0.09)}\n$$\n$$\n-0.05 = \\frac{0.09 - \\hat{s}_{21}}{1 - 0.018}\n$$\n$$\n-0.05 = \\frac{0.09 - \\hat{s}_{21}}{0.982}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $\\hat{s}_{21}$:\n$$\n-0.05 \\times 0.982 = 0.09 - \\hat{s}_{21}\n$$\n$$\n-0.0491 = 0.09 - \\hat{s}_{21}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{s}_{21} = 0.09 + 0.0491\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{s}_{21} = 0.1391\n$$\nThe observation that $m_{\\mathrm{A}\\text{-only}} < 0$ indicates overcompensation, which is consistent with our result that the estimated value $\\hat{s}_{21} = 0.1391$ is greater than the true value $s_{21} = 0.09$.

The variance of the transformed estimator is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln(\\hat{p})) \\approx [f'(p)]^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)^2 \\frac{p(1-p)}{n} = \\frac{1-p}{np} $$\nThe variance is estimated by substituting the MLE $\\hat{p}$ for $p$:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\ln(\\hat{p})) = \\frac{1-\\hat{p}}{n\\hat{p}} = \\frac{1-x/n}{n(x/n)} = \\frac{n-x}{nx} $$\nIn this problem, the observed proportions $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 10^{-4}$ and $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{post}} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}$ are very small. Thus, the terms $(1-\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{pre}})$ and $(1-\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{post}})$ are both very close to $1$. We can therefore make the well-justified approximation that $1-p \\approx 1$. This simplifies the estimated variance:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\ln(\\hat{p})) \\approx \\frac{1}{n\\hat{p}} = \\frac{1}{x} $$\nThis approximation is standard and robust for low-frequency count data, as is common in sequencing experiments.\n\nThe pre-sort and post-sort sequencing are independent experiments. Therefore, the random variables $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ and $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{post}}$ are independent. Consequently, their transformations $\\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{pre}})$ and $\\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{post}})$ are also independent. The variance of the difference $\\hat{\\theta} = \\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{post}}) - \\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{pre}})$ is the sum of the individual variances:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{post}})) + \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{pre}})) \\approx \\frac{1}{x_{\\mathrm{post}}} + \\frac{1}{x_{\\mathrm{pre}}} $$\nThe standard error (SE) of $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the square root of this variance:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x_{\\mathrm{post}}} + \\frac{1}{x_{\\mathrm{pre}}}} $$\nBy the Central Limit Theorem and the delta method, $\\hat{\\theta}$ is approximately normally distributed. A two-sided $0.95$ confidence interval for $\\theta = \\ln(E)$ is given by:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta} \\pm z_{1-0.05/2} \\cdot \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat{\\theta}) $$\nwhere $z_{0.975}$ is the $0.975$ quantile of the standard normal distribution, which is approximately $1.96$.\n\nLet's compute the numerical values:\nThe point estimate for the log-enrichment factor is:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta} = \\ln(\\hat{E}) = \\ln(20) \\approx 2.9957 $$\nThe standard error is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{50}} = \\sqrt{0.0025 + 0.02} = \\sqrt{0.0225} = 0.15 $$\nThe margin of error for the $0.95$ confidence interval is:\n$$ ME = 1.96 \\times 0.15 = 0.294 $$\nThe $0.95$ confidence interval for $\\theta = \\ln(E)$ is:\n$$ 2.9957 \\pm 0.294 $$\nThis gives the interval $[2.7017, 3.2897]$.\n\nTo obtain the confidence interval for the enrichment factor $E$, we exponentiate the endpoints of the interval for $\\ln(E)$:\n$$ \\text{Lower bound for } E = \\exp(2.7017) \\approx 14.906 $$\n$$ \\text{Upper bound for } E = \\exp(3.2897) \\approx 26.835 $$\nAlternatively, we can express the interval for $E$ as:\n$$ \\hat{E} \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\pm z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x_{\\mathrm{pre}}} + \\frac{1}{x_{\\mathrm{post}}}}\\right) $$\n$$ 20 \\cdot \\exp(\\pm 0.294) $$\nLower bound: $20 \\cdot \\exp(-0.294) \\approx 20 \\times 0.74528 = 14.906$.\nUpper bound: $20 \\cdot \\exp(0.294) \\approx 20 \\times 1.34177 = 26.835$.\n\nThe required final result is a row matrix containing the point estimate $\\hat{E}$, the lower confidence bound, and the upper confidence bound, with each value rounded to three significant figures.\n$\\hat{E} = 20 \\to 20.0$\nLower bound $= 14.906 \\to 14.9$\nUpper bound $= 26.835 \\to 26.8$\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 20.0 & 14.9 & 26.8 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 20.0 & 14.9 & 26.8 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2743984"}]}
