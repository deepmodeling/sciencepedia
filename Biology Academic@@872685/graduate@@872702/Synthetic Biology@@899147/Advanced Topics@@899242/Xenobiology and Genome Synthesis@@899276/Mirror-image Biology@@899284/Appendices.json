It provides a sound mathematical framework for analyzing the effects of a mirror reflection on a chiral center, a fundamental concept in stereochemistry and mirror-image biology. We may therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must derive the matrix representation of a mirror reflection. Second, we must use this result to determine how the signed chirality measure $S$ transforms under such a reflection.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Reflection Matrix $R(\\mathbf{n})$\n\nWe are given that any vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be uniquely decomposed into a component parallel to the plane $\\Pi$, denoted $\\mathbf{x}_{\\parallel}$, and a component perpendicular to $\\Pi$, denoted $\\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}$. Thus, we have $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}_{\\parallel} + \\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}$.\n\nThe plane $\\Pi$ is defined as passing through the origin with a unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$. The component of $\\mathbf{x}$ perpendicular to the plane $\\Pi$ is its orthogonal projection onto the direction of the normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$. Since $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector (i.e., $|\\mathbf{n}|=1$), this projection is given by the dot product of $\\mathbf{x}$ with $\\mathbf{n}$, multiplied by the vector $\\mathbf{n}$ itself:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{\\perp} = (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\mathbf{n}\n$$\nThe component parallel to the plane is then found by subtracting the perpendicular component from the original vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{\\parallel} = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_{\\perp} = \\mathbf{x} - (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\mathbf{n}\n$$\nThe second foundational principle states that a mirror reflection across $\\Pi$ maps a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ to a new vector $\\mathbf{x}'$ by reversing the perpendicular component while leaving the parallel component unchanged:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x}_{\\parallel} - \\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mathbf{x}_{\\parallel}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}' = \\left(\\mathbf{x} - (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\mathbf{n}\\right) - \\left((\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\mathbf{n}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - 2(\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\mathbf{n}\n$$\nTo find the matrix $R(\\mathbf{n})$ such that $\\mathbf{x}' = R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{x}$, we express the transformation in matrix notation. The dot product $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ can be written as $\\mathbf{n}^{T}\\mathbf{x}$. The term $(\\mathbf{n}^{T}\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{n}$ can be rewritten using the outer product of $\\mathbf{n}$ with itself, denoted $\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{n}^{T}$, which is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix. The action of this outer product matrix on $\\mathbf{x}$ is $(\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{n}^{T})\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{n}^{T}\\mathbf{x})=(\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{n}$.\nThus, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - 2(\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{n}^{T})\\mathbf{x} = (I - 2\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{n}^{T})\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. By inspection, the reflection matrix is:\n$$\nR(\\mathbf{n}) = I - 2\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{n}^{T}\n$$\nThis is the well-known Householder transformation matrix for a reflection.\n\nPart 2: Transformation of the Chirality Measure $S$\n\nThe initial signed chirality measure is given by the determinant of a matrix whose columns are the vectors connecting substituent $A$ to the other substituents:\n$$\nS = \\det\\!\\big[\\mathbf{r}_{B}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}\\;\\;\\mathbf{r}_{C}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}\\;\\;\\mathbf{r}_{D}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}\\big]\n$$\nLet us define the vectors $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{r}_{B}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}$, $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{r}_{C}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}$, and $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{r}_{D}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}$. Then $S = \\det[\\mathbf{u} \\;\\; \\mathbf{v} \\;\\; \\mathbf{w}]$.\n\nAfter reflection, each position vector $\\mathbf{r}_{i}$ is transformed into $\\mathbf{r}_{i}' = R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{r}_{i}$. Due to the linearity of the transformation $R(\\mathbf{n})$, the new vectors defining the reflected tetrahedron's edges are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{r}_{B}'-\\mathbf{r}_{A}' = R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{r}_{B} - R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{r}_{A} = R(\\mathbf{n})(\\mathbf{r}_{B}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}) = R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{u}\n$$\nSimilarly, $\\mathbf{v}' = R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}' = R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{w}$.\n\nThe new chirality measure, $S'$, is the determinant of the matrix with these new column vectors:\n$$\nS' = \\det[\\mathbf{u}' \\;\\; \\mathbf{v}' \\;\\; \\mathbf{w}'] = \\det[R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{u} \\;\\; R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{v} \\;\\; R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{w}]\n$$\nLet $M = [\\mathbf{u} \\;\\; \\mathbf{v} \\;\\; \\mathbf{w}]$ be the matrix whose determinant is $S$. The matrix for $S'$ is the product of the matrix $R(\\mathbf{n})$ and the matrix $M$.\n$$\n[R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{u} \\;\\; R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{v} \\;\\; R(\\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{w}] = R(\\mathbf{n})M\n$$\nTherefore, $S' = \\det(R(\\mathbf{n})M)$. A fundamental property of determinants states that $\\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B)$. Applying this rule:\n$$\nS' = \\det(R(\\mathbf{n})) \\det(M) = \\det(R(\\mathbf{n})) S\n$$\nThe problem now reduces to finding the determinant of the reflection matrix $R(\\mathbf{n})$. We can find this by analyzing the eigenvalues of the transformation. A reflection across a plane in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ has the following geometric properties:\n1. Any vector lying within the plane of reflection is unchanged. The plane is a two-dimensional eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +1$. Thus, we have two eigenvalues, $\\lambda_{1} = 1$ and $\\lambda_{2} = 1$.\n2. Any vector perpendicular to the plane of reflection (i.e., parallel to $\\mathbf{n}$) is inverted. The normal direction is a one-dimensional eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -1$. Thus, the third eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{3} = -1$.\n\nThe determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues.\n$$\n\\det(R(\\mathbf{n})) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = (1)(1)(-1) = -1\n$$\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for $S'$:\n$$\nS' = (-1) S = -S\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $S'/S$.\n$$\n\\frac{S'}{S} = -1\n$$\nThis result confirms the geometric intuition that a mirror reflection is an orientation-reversing transformation.

The assumptions are clearly stated and support the required derivation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A rigorous solution will now be presented.\n\nThe initial velocity, $v_0$, of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is the turnover number, $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant, $[E]_T$ is the total enzyme concentration, and $[S]$ is the substrate concentration.\n\nWe are given that the measurements are taken in the low-substrate regime, which is mathematically expressed as $[S] \\ll K_M$. Under this approximation, the denominator of the Michaelis-Menten equation simplifies:\n$$K_M + [S] \\approx K_M$$\nThe equation for the initial velocity thus becomes:\n$$v_0 \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_M} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right) [E]_T [S]$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}$ is the specificity constant, which represents the second-order rate constant for the reaction between the enzyme and the substrate at low substrate concentrations.\n\nWe can write the specific velocity expressions for the L- and D-enantiomers under this condition:\n$$v_{0,\\text{L}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat,L}}}{K_{M,\\text{L}}}\\right) [E]_T [S]_{\\text{L}}$$\n$$v_{0,\\text{D}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat,D}}}{K_{M,\\text{D}}}\\right) [E]_T [S]_{\\text{D}}$$\n\nThe enantioselectivity factor, which we will denote as $E$, is defined as the ratio of the reaction rates for the two enantiomers under identical conditions. The problem states that the enzyme and substrate concentrations are identical, i.e., $[S]_{\\text{L}} = [S]_{\\text{D}} = [S]$ and $[E]_T$ is the same for both experiments. Therefore, we can express $E$ as the ratio of the initial velocities:\n$$E = \\frac{v_{0,\\text{L}}}{v_{0,\\text{D}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the velocities in the low-substrate limit:\n$$E = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat,L}}}{K_{M,\\text{L}}}\\right) [E]_T [S]}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat,D}}}{K_{M,\\text{D}}}\\right) [E]_T [S]}$$\nThe terms $[E]_T$ and $[S]$ cancel, yielding the expression for the enantioselectivity factor in terms of the measurable kinetic parameters:\n$$E = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat,L}}/K_{M,\\text{L}}}{k_{\\text{cat,D}}/K_{M,\\text{D}}}$$\nThis demonstrates that the enantioselectivity is the ratio of the specificity constants for the two enantiomers.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $E$ using the provided data.

The result is a dimensionless number as the units of the specificity constants cancel.\n\nQualitative explanation:\nThe extremely large calculated value of the enantioselectivity factor, $E=3.750 \\times 10^4$, indicates a profound preference of the enzyme for the L-enantiomer over the D-enantiomer. This kinetic outcome is entirely consistent with the provided structural information. For the L-enantiomer, the \"preorganized bidentate salt bridge\" and \"2 backbone hydrogen bonds\" signify a highly complementary and stable interaction with the active site. Such precise binding ($K_{M,\\text{L}}$ is low) and optimal orientation for catalysis ($k_{\\text{cat,L}}$ is high) lead to a very high specificity constant $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M)_{\\text{L}}$. Conversely, for the D-enantiomer, the \"inverted\" geometry results in the \"loss of these hydrogen bonds,\" leading to much weaker binding (a three-orders-of-magnitude larger $K_{M,\\text{D}}$), and a \"steric clash\" that impedes proper positioning for the chemical step, causing a drastically reduced turnover number ($k_{\\text{cat,D}}$ is over $100$-fold smaller). The combined effect of poor binding and inefficient catalysis for the D-enantiomer results in a minuscule specificity constant $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M)_{\\text{D}}$. The ratio of these two efficiencies, one very large and one very small, naturally produces the substantial enantioselectivity factor computed.

In mirror-image biology, this presents a unique challenge: how do you distinguish and quantify enantiomers, which are identical in mass and most other physical properties?

The team suggests that mass spectrometry can directly resolve the L- and D-alanine enantiomers without any special treatment. You are asked to evaluate this claim from first principles and, if incorrect, to design a derivatization strategy that yields resolvable signals and that includes explicit predictions of mass differences and proper controls.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions, an enantiomer is one of a pair of non-superimposable mirror-image molecules that are identical in all scalar physical properties in an achiral environment. A mass spectrometer measures mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, and standard analyzers create electric or magnetic fields that, to very high accuracy, are achiral. Consider electrospray ionization to generate singly protonated ions $(z = +1)$, and assume normal organic isotopic distributions and typical high-resolution liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nWhich option best justifies why direct mass spectrometry cannot resolve enantiomers and proposes a scientifically sound diastereomer-forming derivatization strategy for D- versus L-alanine, including expected $m/z$ differences and essential controls? Choose the single best option.\n\nA. Direct mass spectrometry cannot resolve enantiomers because in an achiral instrument both enantiomers have identical mass $m$ and charge $z$, hence identical $m/z$, and the fields do not discriminate handedness. To resolve them, split the sample into two aliquots and derivatize each with an enantiopure chiral reagent to form diastereomers. To mass-encode the pairs, use an isotope-coded tag pair: for example, react aliquot $1$ with L-Marfery-type tag $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (light) and aliquot $2$ with D-Marfery-type tag $T_{\\mathrm{D}}^{*}$ (heavy), where $T^{*}$ differs by ${}^{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5}$ so the net mass offset is $\\Delta m \\approx 5 \\times 1.0063\\,\\mathrm{Da} \\approx 5.03\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. After mixing, the sample is analyzed by LC-MS. The chromatographic or ion-mobility separation of diastereomers, combined with the mass doublets created by the isotope tags, allows for assignment and quantification. For example, pseudo-enantiomeric pairs (e.g., L-analyte with $T_L$ and D-analyte with $T_D^*$) will co-elute and can be distinguished by their mass difference, forming a doublet separated by $\\Delta m/z$. Essential controls include a reagent blank (no analyte) to account for background; enantiopure $L$ and $D$ alanine standards derivatized in both channels to verify diastereomer resolution; a racemic standard to validate coelution patterns and doublet spacing; and a racemization control by varying derivatization conditions and confirming that cross-channel coelution patterns and doublet ratios remain constant. The observed $m/z$ separation scales as $\\Delta m / z$ for other charge states.\n\nB. Direct mass spectrometry can resolve enantiomers if the mass analyzer has sufficient resolving power (for example, $R \\approx 200{,}000$) because L- and D-forms have slightly different rotational constants and therefore different exact masses at the parts-per-million level. Therefore, no derivatization or chiral separation is necessary. Controls are limited to a mass-calibration standard to maintain $< 1$ parts per million accuracy.\n\nC. Introduce a chiral mobile-phase modifier in the electrospray plume so that the quadrupole filters ions differently by handedness, yielding distinct $m/z$ for L- and D-alanine directly. A single-aliquot derivatization with an achiral reagent $T$ is sufficient, because the different three-dimensional orientations of the enantiomers will cause a small intrinsic mass difference of approximately $0.003\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. Controls include running the method with and without the chiral modifier to demonstrate an $m/z$ shift.\n\nD. Form a noncovalent complex between the enantiomer and a chiral crown ether and analyze by mass spectrometry. Because the complexes are enantiomer-specific, the L-complex and D-complex will differ by $+1\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ in mass if the crown ether is left-handed versus right-handed. Controls are unnecessary because the noncovalent complex enforces chirality recognition.\n\nE. Perform a single derivatization of the mixture with an enantiopure chiral reagent $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ to make diastereomers. The two diastereomers will have different exact masses because one retains the leaving group more strongly than the other, producing a predictable $\\Delta m$ of approximately $1.0\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ that is visible at $z=+1$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and free from ambiguity or contradiction. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nFirst, the initial claim must be evaluated. The claim is that a standard mass spectrometer can directly resolve enantiomers such as L-alanine and D-alanine.\nAccording to the provided definition, enantiomers possess identical scalar physical properties in an achiral environment. Molecular mass, $m$, is a scalar property, determined by the sum of the masses of the constituent atoms according to the molecule's chemical formula. L-alanine and D-alanine share the identical chemical formula, $\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_7\\text{NO}_2$. Therefore, their molecular masses are strictly identical.\n$$m_{\\text{L-alanine}} = m_{\\text{D-alanine}}$$\nDuring electrospray ionization to form singly protonated ions, each enantiomer acquires a single proton, resulting in an identical charge, $z = +1$.\n$$z_{\\text{L-alanine}} = z_{\\text{D-alanine}} = +1$$\nA mass spectrometer separates ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$. Since both $m$ and $z$ are identical for the protonated enantiomers, their $m/z$ values are also identical.\n$$\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{\\text{L-alanine}} = \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{\\text{D-alanine}}$$\nFurthermore, the electric and magnetic fields within a standard mass analyzer are achiral. They interact with ions based on properties like momentum and trajectory as determined by $m/z$, but not based on molecular handedness (chirality).\nTherefore, direct analysis by mass spectrometry cannot distinguish between enantiomers. The initial claim is false.\n\nNext, a strategy must be devised to resolve the enantiomers. Since an achiral instrument cannot distinguish enantiomers, the enantiomers must be converted into a form that is distinguishable. The standard chemical method is to convert the pair of enantiomers into a pair of diastereomers. A diastereomer is a stereoisomer that is not a mirror image. Diastereomers have different physical properties (e.g., solubility, melting point, chromatographic retention time) even in an achiral environment.\nThis is achieved by reacting the enantiomeric mixture with a single, enantiopure chiral derivatizing agent, let us call it $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{L-alanine} + T_{\\mathrm{L}} &\\rightarrow (\\text{L-alanine})-T_{\\mathrm{L}} \\\\\n\\text{D-alanine} + T_{\\mathrm{L}} &\\rightarrow (\\text{D-alanine})-T_{\\mathrm{L}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThe products, $(\\text{L-alanine})-T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $(\\text{D-alanine})-T_{\\mathrm{L}}$, are diastereomers. However, they are formed from components with the same mass and thus have identical chemical formulas and identical masses. A mass spectrometer alone still cannot distinguish them. They can, however, be separated by chromatography (LC) prior to MS detection.\n\nTo create a resolvable signal directly within the mass spectrometer, a mass difference must be introduced. This can be accomplished using an isotope-labeling strategy. A superior method involves using two enantiomeric forms of a chiral derivatizing agent, where one is isotopically labeled (heavy) and the other is not (light). Let the light L-tag be $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and the heavy D-tag be $T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*$. The sample is split into two aliquots.\n- **Aliquot 1:** The analyte mixture (L-Ala, D-Ala) is reacted with $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$. Products: $(\\text{L-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $(\\text{D-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n- **Aliquot 2:** The analyte mixture (L-Ala, D-Ala) is reacted with $T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*$. Products: $(\\text{L-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*$ and $(\\text{D-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*$.\n\nThe aliquots are then combined and analyzed by LC-MS. The key insight is to consider which pairs are enantiomers. The pair $((\\text{L-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{L}})$ and $((\\text{D-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{D}})$ are enantiomers. Since $T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*$ is an isotopologue of $T_{\\mathrm{D}}$, the pair $((\\text{L-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{L}})$ and $((\\text{D-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*)$ will co-elute on an achiral chromatographic column. However, they have different masses. If the mass difference between the light and heavy tags is $\\Delta m$, we will observe a mass doublet at a single retention time: one signal at $m/z$ from $(\\text{L-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and another at $(m+\\Delta m)/z$ from $(\\text{D-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*$. The ratio of their intensities gives the ratio $[\\text{L-Ala}]/[\\text{D-Ala}]$.\n\nSimilarly, the pair $((\\text{D-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{L}})$ and $((\\text{L-Ala})-T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*)$ are enantiomers (one being an isotopologue) and will co-elute at a different retention time. This provides a second, independent measurement of the enantiomeric ratio, where the intensity ratio corresponds to $[\\text{D-Ala}]/[\\text{L-Ala}]$. This is a robust and elegant analytical strategy.\n\nRigorous validation requires a comprehensive set of controls: a reagent blank, enantiopure standards of both L- and D-alanine, a racemic standard, and checks for racemization during the derivatization reaction.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** This option correctly states that direct mass spectrometry cannot resolve enantiomers due to their identical $m/z$. It proposes a sophisticated and scientifically sound derivatization strategy using a pair of isotope-coded chiral tags ($T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{D}}^*$) applied to split aliquots. This method is designed to produce mass-differentiated signals for the enantiomers that can be resolved by the mass spectrometer. The calculation of the mass offset for a ${}^{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5}$ tag is correct: $\\Delta m = 5 \\times (\\text{mass}({}^2\\text{H}) - \\text{mass}({}^1\\text{H})) \\approx 5 \\times (2.0141\\,\\mathrm{Da} - 1.0078\\,\\mathrm{Da}) \\approx 5.03\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. The description of the analytical outcome is scientifically correct, explaining that diastereomers can be separated while pseudo-enantiomeric pairs co-elute and are distinguished by mass. Most importantly, it proposes a comprehensive and scientifically necessary set of controls, demonstrating a rigorous analytical approach. This option is scientifically robust. **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This option claims that enantiomers have different exact masses due to different rotational constants. This is fundamentally false. Mass is an intrinsic, scalar property of a molecule determined by its atomic composition, not its three-dimensional structure or rotational dynamics. Enantiomers have identical atomic compositions and therefore identical masses. High resolving power cannot separate two species with the same $m/z$. This statement violates the first principles of chemistry and physics. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This option proposes two scientifically invalid concepts. First, it claims a chiral mobile-phase modifier can cause a quadrupole to filter ions by handedness, creating distinct $m/z$ values. A quadrupole filters based on $m/z$ trajectories in an achiral field; a chiral modifier would at best form non-covalent diastereomers of identical mass. Second, it claims that different 3D orientations cause an \"intrinsic mass difference,\" which is physically impossible. Mass is not a function of orientation. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option correctly identifies that forming non-covalent complexes with a chiral host (like a crown ether) is a valid approach to creating diastereomers. However, it then makes the unsupported claim that this will result in a mass difference of $+1\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. Diastereomers, whether covalent or non-covalent, have identical chemical formulas and therefore identical masses. The assertion that they differ in mass by a specific amount is baseless. Furthermore, the claim that \"controls are unnecessary\" is a sign of extremely poor scientific practice and is fundamentally wrong for any analytical method. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.** This option correctly proposes derivatization with an enantiopure chiral reagent to create diastereomers. However, it then falsely claims that these diastereomers will have different exact masses. The products $(\\text{L-alanine})-T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $(\\text{D-alanine})-T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. The reasoning about retaining a leaving group is irrelevant to the mass of the final product. The suggestion of a $\\Delta m \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ is arbitrary. Finally, stating that a reagent blank is the only necessary control is scientifically irresponsible and inadequate for method validation. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the problem based on first principles, proposes a scientifically valid and sophisticated solution, and includes the rigorous controls essential for a reliable analytical method.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2751484"}]}
