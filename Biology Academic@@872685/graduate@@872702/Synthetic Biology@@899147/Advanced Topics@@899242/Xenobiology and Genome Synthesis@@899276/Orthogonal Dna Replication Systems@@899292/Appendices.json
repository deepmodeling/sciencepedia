In such a system, the orthogonal polymerase encounters two classes of nucleotides: a chemically matched “right” orthogonal deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) and a host “wrong” deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) that can be misincorporated at a low rate. Assume a minimal two-state binding-and-catalysis mechanism for each nucleotide class, with the polymerase free state and its nucleotide-bound state as the only kinetically relevant states before chemistry.

It describes a standard scenario in enzyme kinetics—the competition of two substrates for a single active site—applied to the relevant context of synthetic biology. Therefore, it is a valid problem.\n\nWe begin by establishing the kinetic model. The orthogonal DNA polymerase, which we denote as the enzyme $E$, encounters two substrates: the right orthogonal nucleotide, $S_r$, and the wrong host nucleotide, $S_w$. The concentrations are $[S_r] = [dNTP]_r$ and $[S_w] = [dNTP]_w$. Under the steady-state Michaelis-Menten framework for two competing substrates, the individual reaction velocities for the formation of the right product ($v_r$) and the wrong product ($v_w$) are given by:\n\n$$ v_r = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat},r} [E]_0 [S_r]}{K_{M,r} \\left(1 + \\frac{[S_w]}{K_{M,w}}\\right) + [S_r]} $$\n$$ v_w = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat},w} [E]_0 [S_w]}{K_{M,w} \\left(1 + \\frac{[S_r]}{K_{M,r}}\\right) + [S_w]} $$\n\nwhere $[E]_0$ is the total enzyme concentration, $k_{\\text{cat},i}$ is the catalytic rate constant for substrate $i$, and $K_{M,i}$ is the Michaelis constant for substrate $i$. An equivalent and more useful formulation is obtained by rearranging the denominator:\n\n$$ v_r = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat},r} \\frac{[S_r]}{K_{M,r}} [E]_0}{1 + \\frac{[S_r]}{K_{M,r}} + \\frac{[S_w]}{K_{M,w}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_r [S_r] [E]_0}{1 + \\frac{[S_r]}{K_{M,r}} + \\frac{[S_w]}{K_{M,w}}} $$\n$$ v_w = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_w [S_w] [E]_0}{1 + \\frac{[S_r]}{K_{M,r}} + \\frac{[S_w]}{K_{M,w}}} $$\n\nThe problem specifies two key approximations.\n\n**Approximation 1: Dilute nucleotide conditions relative to the Michaelis constant.**\nThis condition implies that $[S_r] \\ll K_{M,r}$ and $[S_w] \\ll K_{M,w}$. Consequently, the terms $\\frac{[S_r]}{K_{M,r}}$ and $\\frac{[S_w]}{K_{M,w}}$ are both much smaller than $1$. The denominator in the rate equations can therefore be approximated as:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{[S_r]}{K_{M,r}} + \\frac{[S_w]}{K_{M,w}} \\approx 1 $$\nUnder this approximation, the reaction velocities simplify to being directly proportional to the catalytic efficiency, $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M)$, and the substrate concentration.\n$$ v_r \\approx \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_r [S_r] [E]_0 $$\n$$ v_w \\approx \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_w [S_w] [E]_0 $$\n\nThe wrong-incorporation error fraction, which we denote as $f_{\\text{error}}$, is defined as the rate of wrong incorporation divided by the total rate of incorporation:\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} = \\frac{v_w}{v_r + v_w} $$\nSubstituting the simplified rate expressions, we get:\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_w [S_w] [E]_0}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_r [S_r] [E]_0 + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_w [S_w] [E]_0} $$\nThe total enzyme concentration $[E]_0$ cancels, yielding:\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_w [S_w]}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_r [S_r] + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_w [S_w]} $$\n\n**Approximation 2: Wrong incorporation is rare compared to right incorporation.**\nThis condition implies that $v_w \\ll v_r$. The denominator of the error fraction, $v_r + v_w$, can thus be approximated as simply $v_r$. This leads to a further simplification of the expression for $f_{\\text{error}}$:\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} \\approx \\frac{v_w}{v_r} $$\nSubstituting the rate expressions derived from Approximation 1:\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_w [S_w] [E]_0}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_r [S_r] [E]_0} $$\nThis gives the final derived expression for the error fraction under the specified conditions:\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_w [S_w]}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_r [S_r]} $$\nThis expression shows that the error fraction is determined by the ratio of the catalytic efficiencies weighted by the concentrations of the respective nucleotide substrates.\n\nQualitatively, system fidelity, which is the inverse of the error fraction ($1/f_{\\text{error}}$), can be tuned by altering nucleotide concentrations. Based on the derived formula, fidelity can be increased (i.e., $f_{\\text{error}}$ can be decreased) by:\n$1$. Increasing the concentration of the right substrate, $[S_r] = [dNTP]_r$. This increases the denominator, thus decreasing the overall fraction.\n$2$. Decreasing the concentration of the wrong substrate, $[S_w] = [dNTP]_w$. This decreases the numerator, thus decreasing the overall fraction.\nTherefore, modulating the ratio $[dNTP]_r/[dNTP]_w$ provides a direct mechanism for controlling the fidelity of the orthogonal replication system, supplementing the intrinsic discrimination provided by the polymerase's catalytic efficiencies.\n\nWe now proceed to the numerical calculation. The given values are:\nCatalytic efficiency for right dNTP, $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M)_r = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nCatalytic efficiency for wrong dNTP, $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M)_w = 1.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nConcentration of right dNTP, $[S_r] = [dNTP]_r = 50\\ \\mu\\text{M} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{M}$.\nConcentration of wrong dNTP, $[S_w] = [dNTP]_w = 1.0\\ \\mu\\text{M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $f_{\\text{error}}$:\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} \\approx \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M})}{(2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{M})} $$\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} \\approx \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{2}} $$\n$$ f_{\\text{error}} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

It is a well-defined exercise in applying fundamental principles of probability theory to a problem in synthetic biology. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the expected number of heritable substitutions in a gene of length $L$ after a single round of replication. The process of substitution at each nucleotide site can be modeled as a stochastic event.\n\nAccording to the givens, a substitution occurs at a given nucleotide position if a misincorporation event happens during replication. Condition (i) states that the probability of such an event is a constant, $\\epsilon$. This describes a process with two discrete outcomes: substitution or no substitution. Such a trial is a Bernoulli trial.\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable, $X_i$, for each nucleotide position $i$ in the gene, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $L$. We define the variable such that:\n- $X_i = 1$ if a heritable substitution occurs at position $i$.\n- $X_i = 0$ if no substitution occurs at position $i$.\n\nFrom condition (i), the probability of a substitution is $P(X_i = 1) = \\epsilon$. Consequently, the probability of no substitution is $P(X_i = 0) = 1 - \\epsilon$.\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is, by definition, the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i=0))$$\nSubstituting the given probability, we find:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot \\epsilon) + (0 \\cdot (1-\\epsilon)) = \\epsilon$$\nThe expected value for a substitution at any single site $i$ is therefore equal to the probability of misincorporation, $\\epsilon$. This is constant for all sites.\n\nThe total number of heritable substitutions in the entire gene, which we denote as the random variable $S$, is the sum of the substitutions occurring at each of the $L$ nucleotide positions. Thus, $S$ is the sum of the individual indicator variables:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} X_i$$\nThe problem asks for the expected number of substitutions, which is the expectation of $S$, denoted $E[S]$.\n\nThe problem statement explicitly requires the use of the linearity of expectation. This fundamental property of expectation states that the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values. This holds true whether the variables are independent or not, although condition (ii) does state independence in this case.\nApplying this principle:\n$$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{L} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[X_i]$$\nWe have already determined that $E[X_i] = \\epsilon$ for every site $i$ from $1$ to $L$. We can substitute this constant value into the summation:\n$$E[S] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\epsilon$$\nThis is the sum of a constant, $\\epsilon$, over $L$ terms. The result of this summation is simply the constant multiplied by the number of terms:\n$$E[S] = L \\epsilon$$\nThis is the final, closed-form analytic expression for the expected number of heritable base substitutions introduced into the gene per cell generation, expressed in terms of the given parameters $L$ and $\\epsilon$.

For each plasmid, there are two possible outcomes: it segregates to daughter cell 1 (let's call this \"success\") or to daughter cell 2 (\"failure\"). The problem states that the probability of segregating to either daughter cell is equal, so the probability of success for each trial is $p = 1/2$.\n\nLet $k$ be the random variable representing the number of plasmids that segregate to daughter cell 1.
