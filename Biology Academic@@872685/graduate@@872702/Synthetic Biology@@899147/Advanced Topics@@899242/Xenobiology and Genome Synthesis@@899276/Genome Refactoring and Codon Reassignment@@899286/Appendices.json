Let $T_{f} \\sim \\text{Exp}(r_{f})$ be the waiting time to forward elongation and $T_{s} \\sim \\text{Exp}(r_{s})$ the waiting time to frameshift. The memoryless property of exponential distributions is a fundamental fact from stochastic kinetics consistent with single-step, rate-limiting transitions in translation elongation.\n\nThe probability that frameshift occurs before forward elongation is\n$$\nP = \\Pr(T_{s} < T_{f}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Pr(T_{f} > t)\\, f_{T_{s}}(t)\\, dt \n= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-r_{f} t)\\, r_{s} \\exp(-r_{s} t)\\, dt \n= r_{s} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(r_{s}+r_{f}) t)\\, dt \n= \\frac{r_{s}}{r_{s}+r_{f}}.\n$$\nThus, for motif $m$ with baseline rates $r_{s,m}$ and $r_{f,m}$, the baseline frameshift probability is\n$$\nP_{\\text{old},m} = \\frac{r_{s,m}}{r_{s,m} + r_{f,m}}.\n$$\nCodon reassignment modifies local decoding and scales the forward rate by $\\gamma_{m}$, leaving $r_{s,m}$ unchanged, so the new frameshift probability is\n$$\nP_{\\text{new},m} = \\frac{r_{s,m}}{r_{s,m} + \\gamma_{m} r_{f,m}}.\n$$\n\nThe transcriptome-weighted expectations are\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[P_{\\text{old}}] = \\sum_{m=1}^{3} w_{m} P_{\\text{old},m}, \\quad\n\\mathbb{E}[P_{\\text{new}}] = \\sum_{m=1}^{3} w_{m} P_{\\text{new},m},\n$$\nand the change is $\\Delta = \\mathbb{E}[P_{\\text{new}}] - \\mathbb{E}[P_{\\text{old}}]$.\n\nWe compute each term motif-by-motif.\n\nMotif $1$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{old},1} = \\frac{0.05}{0.05+0.20} = \\frac{0.05}{0.25} = 0.2,\n\\quad\nP_{\\text{new},1} = \\frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6 \\times 0.20} = \\frac{0.05}{0.05+0.12} = \\frac{0.05}{0.17} = \\frac{5}{17} \\approx 0.2941176471.\n$$\n\nMotif $2$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{old},2} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08+0.16} = \\frac{0.08}{0.24} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333333333,\n\\quad\nP_{\\text{new},2} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08 + 1.5 \\times 0.16} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08+0.24} = \\frac{0.08}{0.32} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25.\n$$\n\nMotif $3$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{old},3} = \\frac{0.03}{0.03+0.12} = \\frac{0.03}{0.15} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2,\n\\quad\nP_{\\text{new},3} = \\frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.9 \\times 0.12} = \\frac{0.03}{0.03+0.108} = \\frac{0.03}{0.138} = \\frac{30}{138} = \\frac{5}{23} \\approx 0.2173913043.\n$$\n\nWeight the contributions:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[P_{\\text{old}}] = 0.5 \\times 0.2 + 0.3 \\times \\frac{1}{3} + 0.2 \\times 0.2 \n= 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.04 = 0.24 = \\frac{6}{25}.\n$$\nFor the new expectation,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[P_{\\text{new}}] = 0.5 \\times \\frac{5}{17} + 0.3 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 0.2 \\times \\frac{5}{23}\n= \\frac{5}{34} + \\frac{3}{40} + \\frac{1}{23}.\n$$\nPut over a common denominator.
