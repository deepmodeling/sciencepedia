Let $F_1$ be the event of failure for safeguard $A$ with probability $P(F_1) = p_1$, and $F_2$ be the event of failure for safeguard $B$ with probability $P(F_2) = p_2$. The events $F_1$ and $F_2$ are stipulated to be independent.\n\nFirst, we analyze the **series-layered containment** architecture. The problem states that escape requires the \"simultaneous failure of both safeguards.\" In the language of set theory and probability, this corresponds to the intersection of the two failure events, $F_1 \\cap F_2$. The probability of escape for this architecture is thus $P_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,series}} = P(F_1 \\cap F_2)$. By the definition of statistical independence, the probability of the intersection of two independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,series}} = P(F_1 \\cap F_2) = P(F_1) P(F_2) = p_1 p_2.\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the **parallel-vulnerability containment** architecture. The problem states that escape occurs if \"either safeguard fails.\" This corresponds to the union of the two failure events, $F_1 \\cup F_2$. The probability of escape for this architecture is $P_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,parallel}} = P(F_1 \\cup F_2)$. To calculate this, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle for two events:\n$$\nP(F_1 \\cup F_2) = P(F_1) + P(F_2) - P(F_1 \\cap F_2).\n$$\nSubstituting the known probabilities and applying the independence rule for the intersection term, we find:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,parallel}} = p_1 + p_2 - P(F_1) P(F_2) = p_1 + p_2 - p_1 p_2.\n$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the fold-reduction, $\\rho$, defined as the ratio of the escape probability in the series architecture to that in the parallel architecture.\n$$\n\\rho \\equiv \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,series}}}{P_{\\mathrm{escape,\\,parallel}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{p_1 p_2}{p_1 + p_2 - p_1 p_2}.\n$$\nThe problem constraints $0 < p_1 < 1$ and $0 < p_2 < 1$ ensure that the denominator is strictly positive, as $p_1 + p_2 - p_1 p_2 = p_1(1-p_2) + p_2 > 0$.

All necessary parameters ($N$, $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_2$) and definitions are provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of the Escape Probability**\n\nLet $P(\\text{Escape})$ be the probability of the escape event. This event occurs if at least one double-revertant cell is produced from the $N$ initial cells. A direct calculation of this probability would involve summing the probabilities of producing exactly $1$, exactly $2$, ..., up to $N$ double revertants. It is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is the non-occurrence of an escape, and subtract this from $1$. The complementary event, \"No Escape,\" corresponds to zero double-revertant cells being produced.\n\n$$P(\\text{Escape}) = 1 - P(\\text{No Escape})$$\n\nLet us first consider a single cell from the initial population of $N$ cells. This cell attempts one division. A double-revertant progeny is produced if, during this division, a reversion occurs at the locus for $M_1$ AND a reversion occurs at the locus for $M_2$.\n\nThe problem states that these two reversion events are independent.\n- The probability of reversion for $M_1$ is $\\mu_1$.\n- The probability of reversion for $M_2$ is $\\mu_2$.\n\nTherefore, the probability, let us call it $p$, that a single given cell's division attempt results in a double-revertant progeny is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$p = P(\\text{reversion}_1 \\cap \\text{reversion}_2) = P(\\text{reversion}_1) \\times P(\\text{reversion}_2) = \\mu_1 \\mu_2$$\n\nThis outcome, the production of a double revertant from a single cell's division, can be considered a \"success\" in a Bernoulli trial. The probability of \"failure\" for a single trial (i.e., the cell division does not produce a double revertant) is:\n$$1 - p = 1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2$$\n\nNow, we consider the entire population of $N$ cells. Each of the $N$ cells attempts one division. Since the reversion events are independent across cells, we have a series of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials. The \"No Escape\" event occurs if and only if all $N$ of these independent trials result in failure.\n\nThe probability that all $N$ trials fail is the product of their individual failure probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{No Escape}) = (1 - p)^N = (1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)^N$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $P(\\text{Escape})$, we obtain the exact closed-form expression for the escape probability:\n$$P(\\text{Escape}) = 1 - (1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)^N$$\n\nThis is the exact solution based on the binomial model.\n\nThe problem also requests the asymptotic Poisson approximation. This approximation is valid in the limit of rare events, where the number of trials $N$ is very large and the probability of success per trial $p = \\mu_1 \\mu_2$ is very small, such that their product $\\lambda = Np = N \\mu_1 \\mu_2$ is a finite, moderate value. The number of successes in this limit follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$.\n\nThe probability of an escape event is the probability of observing one or more successes, $P(K \\ge 1)$, where $K$ is the random variable for the number of double revertants.\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - P(K = 0)$$\nIn the Poisson approximation, the probability of zero successes is given by:\n$$P(K = 0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda) = \\exp(-N \\mu_1 \\mu_2)$$\nTherefore, the Poisson approximation for the escape probability is:\n$$P(\\text{Escape}) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-N \\mu_1 \\mu_2)$$\nThis result is consistent with the Taylor series expansion of the exact solution for small $p=\\mu_1\\mu_2$:\n$$(1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)^N = \\exp(N \\ln(1 - \\mu_1 \\mu_2)) \\approx \\exp(N(-\\mu_1 \\mu_2)) = \\exp(-N \\mu_1 \\mu_2)$$\n\nThe problem, however, requires the exact closed-form expression for the final answer.

It is a well-posed question in the field of dynamical systems theory applied to a standard model from synthetic biology. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.

Fixed points can therefore be classified as symmetric, where $x^*=y^*$, or they can exist in asymmetric pairs.\n\nA symmetric fixed point $(x_s, x_s)$ must lie on the line $y=x$. Substituting $y=x$ into either nullcline equation gives the condition for such a point:\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x_s^{n}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as $x_s(1+x_s^n) = \\alpha$, or $f(x_s) = x_s^{n+1} + x_s = \\alpha$. For physically meaningful concentrations, we consider $x_s > 0$. The derivative of the function $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = (n+1)x^n + 1$. Since $n > 1$ and $x > 0$, we have $f'(x) > 0$. This means $f(x)$ is strictly monotonically increasing for $x > 0$. Consequently, for any given $\\alpha > 0$, there exists exactly one positive solution $x_s$. Therefore, the system always has exactly one symmetric fixed point.\n\nBistability requires the existence of three fixed points. Since there is always one symmetric fixed point, bistability is achieved when two additional, asymmetric fixed points emerge. This transition from a single fixed point to three fixed points occurs at a bifurcation. Given the symmetry of the system, this is a pitchfork bifurcation, where the central symmetric fixed point loses stability and gives rise to two new stable fixed points.\n\nThe stability of a fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at that point.

The Jacobian is $J_s = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & j_s \\\\ j_s & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the solutions to the characteristic equation $\\det(J_s - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n(-1-\\lambda)^2 - j_s^2 = 0 \\implies 1+\\lambda = \\pm j_s \\implies \\lambda = -1 \\pm j_s\n$$\nThe two eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -1 - \\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_2 = -1 + \\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n}\n$$\nSince $n>1$ and $x_s>0$, the term $\\frac{n x_s^n}{1+x_s^n}$ is always positive.
