The liquid film on the surface is thin and well mixed, and the disinfectant is present in large excess such that its bulk concentration remains effectively constant during the relevant time window. Let $N(t)$ denote the number of viable organisms (for example, in Colony Forming Units (CFU)) at time $t$, and let $N(0)=N_{0}$.

The assumptions (constant concentration, well-mixed, no organic load) are standard simplifications to achieve a first-order kinetic model. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of physical assumptions and asks for a derivation and a subsequent calculation. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for both parts. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language without subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem states that the instantaneous inactivation rate is proportional to the number of viable organisms, $N(t)$, and the disinfectant concentration, $C$. The inactivation rate is the rate of decrease of $N(t)$, which is expressed mathematically as $-\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$. The proportionality can be written as an equation by introducing a proportionality constant, which we will call $k'$.\n\n$$-\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k' N(t) C$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the concentration of the disinfectant, $C$, is constant because it is present in large excess. This allows us to treat the product $k'C$ as a single constant. The equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables.\n\n$$\\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} = -k' C dt$$\n\nTo find the number of organisms $N(t)$ at any time $t$, we integrate both sides of the equation. We integrate the left side from the initial number of organisms $N_{0}$ at time $t=0$ to $N(t)$ at time $t$.\n\n$$\\int_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_{0}^{t} -k' C dt$$\n\nThe integration yields:\n\n$$[\\ln(N)]_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} = -k' C [t]_{0}^{t}$$\n\n$$\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_{0}) = -k' C (t-0)$$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k' C t \\quad (*)$$\n\nThis equation represents the first-order decay process in terms of the natural logarithm ($\\ln$). The problem requires a derivation of a base-$10$ log-linear relationship. To convert from the natural logarithm ($\\ln$, base $e$) to the common logarithm ($\\log_{10}$, base $10$), we use the change of base formula: $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\cdot \\log_{10}(x)$.\n\nApplying this transformation to our equation $(*)$:\n\n$$\\ln(10) \\cdot \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k' C t$$\n\nNow, we isolate the base-$10$ logarithm term to obtain the form consistent with classical Chick-Watson kinetics:\n\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}\\right) C t$$\n\nThis is the desired base-$10$ log-linear relationship. The problem asks to explicitly identify the constant of proportionality that appears in this base-$10$ formulation. Let us define this new constant as $k$.\n\n$$k = \\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}$$\n\nSo the final form of the equation is:\n\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k C t$$\n\nThe constant $k$ is the Chick-Watson rate constant for a base-$10$ formulation. To determine its units, we analyze the dimensions of the original rate equation $-\\frac{dN}{dt} = k' N C$. The number of organisms $N$ is treated as a dimensionless quantity (or in units of CFU, which cancel from both sides). The term $\\frac{dN}{dt}$ has units of inverse time, $[\\text{time}]^{-1}$. The concentration $C$ has units of mass per volume, $[\\text{mass}][\\text{volume}]^{-1}$.\n\n$$[\\text{time}]^{-1} = [k'] \\cdot [\\text{concentration}]$$\n$$[k'] = \\frac{1}{[\\text{time}] \\cdot [\\text{concentration}]}$$\n\nGiven the units in the problem, time is in minutes ($\\mathrm{min}$) and concentration is in milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$). Thus, the units for $k'$ are $(\\mathrm{min} \\cdot \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})^{-1}$, which is $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Since $k = \\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}$ and $\\ln(10)$ is a dimensionless number, the constant $k$ has the exact same units as $k'$: $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. This is consistent with the value provided in the second part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must calculate the contact time $t$ required to achieve a $6$-log reduction. A $6$-log reduction means that the ratio of final to initial organisms is $N(t)/N_{0} = 10^{-6}$.\n\nWe use the derived relationship:\n\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k C t$$\n\nSubstitute the value for a $6$-log reduction:\n\n$$\\log_{10}(10^{-6}) = -k C t$$\n\nThe base-$10$ logarithm of $10^{-6}$ is simply $-6$:\n\n$$-6 = -k C t$$\n\nNow we solve for the required time $t$:\n\n$$t = \\frac{6}{k C}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$C = 500\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n$k = 1.2\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product $kC$:\n\n$$kC = (1.2\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}) \\times (500\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})$$\n$$kC = 1.2\\times 10^{-3} \\times 5 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n$$kC = 6 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1} = 0.6 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the expression for $t$:\n\n$$t = \\frac{6}{0.6 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}}$$\n$$t = 10 \\, \\mathrm{min}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

It provides a standard engineering model for contaminant clearance in a ventilated enclosure. The model for bulk clearance, $dC/dt = -kC$, is a classical representation of a well-mixed volume with a constant purge rate.

This product represents the joint failure probability under the ideal assumption of independence ($r=0$).\n\nThe second term, $r \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)p_2(1-p_2)}$, quantifies the effect of correlation. Since probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$ are between $0$ and $1$, the term $\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)p_2(1-p_2)}$ is a non-negative real number.\n\nWhen a positive correlation exists ($r  0$), it implies that the failure of one barrier makes the failure of the other more likely. Such correlation can arise from common-mode failures, such as a power outage, seismic event, or a systemic human error affecting both barriers. In this case, the term $r \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)p_2(1-p_2)}$ is positive.\n\nConsequently, for any $r  0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(X=1, Y=1) = p_1 p_2 + (\\text{a positive value})  p_1 p_2\n$$\nThis demonstrates unequivocally that a positive correlation increases the joint failure probability above the baseline calculated for independent systems. The multiplicative safety benefit is compromised because the total risk is no longer just the product of the individual risks but is increased by an additive term proportional to the correlation coefficient. The stronger the correlation, the larger the increase in risk, and the less effective the secondary barrier becomes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p_{1}p_{2} + r\\sqrt{p_{1}(1-p_{1})p_{2}(1-p_{2})}}\n$$", "id": "2717114"}]}
