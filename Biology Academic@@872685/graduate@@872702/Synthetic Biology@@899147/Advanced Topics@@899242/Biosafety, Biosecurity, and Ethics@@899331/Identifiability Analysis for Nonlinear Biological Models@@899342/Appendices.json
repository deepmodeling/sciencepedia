It contains no logical or factual flaws. Therefore, the problem is **valid** and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis commences by solving the differential equation for an arbitrary parameter set $\\theta = (\\alpha, \\delta, x(0))$. The state equation is a linear first-order non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\delta x = \\alpha\n$$\nThe solution to this equation is found using an integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp(\\int \\delta \\, dt) = \\exp(\\delta t)$. The solution for $x(t)$, which is identical to the output $y(t)$, is:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta} + \\left(x(0) - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}\\right) \\exp(-\\delta t)\n$$\nThus, the output trajectory is given by:\n$$\ny(t; \\alpha, \\delta, x(0)) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta} + \\left(x(0) - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}\\right) \\exp(-\\delta t)\n$$\nAccording to the definition of structural identifiability, the parameter triple $(\\alpha, \\delta, x(0))$ is globally identifiable if, for any two distinct parameter triples $\\theta_1 = (\\alpha_1, \\delta_1, x_1(0))$ and $\\theta_2 = (\\alpha_2, \\delta_2, x_2(0))$, their corresponding outputs are distinct, i.e., $y(t; \\theta_1) \\neq y(t; \\theta_2)$ for some $t \\ge 0$. Equivalently, we test if the condition $y(t; \\theta_1) = y(t; \\theta_2)$ for all $t \\ge 0$ necessarily implies $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$.\n\nLet us assume two parameter triples $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ yield the same output trajectory for all $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\delta_1} + \\left(x_1(0) - \\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\delta_1}\\right) \\exp(-\\delta_1 t) = \\frac{\\alpha_2}{\\delta_2} + \\left(x_2(0) - \\frac{\\alpha_2}{\\delta_2}\\right) \\exp(-\\delta_2 t)\n$$\nThis equation is an identity in $t$. It can be written in the form $C_1 + K_1 \\exp(-\\delta_1 t) = C_2 + K_2 \\exp(-\\delta_2 t)$, where $C_i = \\alpha_i/\\delta_i$ and $K_i = x_i(0) - \\alpha_i/\\delta_i$.\nFor this equality to hold for all $t \\ge 0$, the functions on both sides must be identical.\n\nA generic experimental condition is one where the system is not at steady state, which means $x(0) \\neq \\alpha/\\delta$. In this case, the coefficient of the exponential term is non-zero, i.e., $K_i \\neq 0$. The functional form $C + K \\exp(-\\delta t)$ with $K \\neq 0$ and $\\delta > 0$ is unique. Two such functions are identical if and only if their corresponding coefficients are equal. We can determine the coefficients by examining the behavior of $y(t)$ and its derivatives. For instance, $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = C_i$, and $y(0) = C_i+K_i$. The time constant $\\delta_i$ can be found from the dynamics.\nTherefore, for the identity to hold, we must have:\n1. $\\delta_1 = \\delta_2$ (from the time constant of the exponential term).\n2. $C_1 = C_2 \\implies \\alpha_1/\\delta_1 = \\alpha_2/\\delta_2$.\n3. $K_1 = K_2 \\implies x_1(0) - \\alpha_1/\\delta_1 = x_2(0) - \\alpha_2/\\delta_2$.\n\nFrom condition 1, we have $\\delta_1 = \\delta_2$. Let us call this value $\\delta$.\nSubstituting this into condition 2 gives $\\alpha_1/\\delta = \\alpha_2/\\delta$, which implies $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2$. Let us call this value $\\alpha$.\nSubstituting these results into condition 3 gives $x_1(0) - \\alpha/\\delta = x_2(0) - \\alpha/\\delta$, which implies $x_1(0) = x_2(0)$.\nThus, $(\\alpha_1, \\delta_1, x_1(0)) = (\\alpha_2, \\delta_2, x_2(0))$. The parameter triple is structurally identifiable under generic conditions.\n\nNow, consider the nongeneric experimental condition under which identifiability fails. This occurs when the analysis above breaks down. The uniqueness of the functional form $C + K \\exp(-\\delta t)$ depends on $K \\neq 0$. If $K = 0$, the output is a constant.\nThe condition $K = 0$ corresponds to $x(0) - \\alpha/\\delta = 0$, or $x(0) = \\alpha/\\delta$. This is the specific case where the initial condition is precisely the steady-state value of the system.\nIn this situation, the output trajectory becomes $y(t) = \\alpha/\\delta$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The measurement yields a single constant value, $y_{ss}$. From the data, we only have one piece of information:\n$$\ny_{ss} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}\n$$\nAny parameter triple $(\\alpha, \\delta, x(0))$ that satisfies $x(0) = \\alpha/\\delta = y_{ss}$ will produce this same constant trajectory. This constitutes an infinite set of indistinguishable triples. Let the observed constant output be $y_c$. The set of indistinguishable parameter triples is $\\{(\\alpha, \\delta, x(0)) \\mid \\alpha = k y_c, \\delta = k, x(0) = y_c, \\text{ for any } k > 0\\}$. In this case, neither $\\alpha$, nor $\\delta$, nor $x(0)$ is individually identifiable. Only the ratio $\\alpha/\\delta$ is identifiable.\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, the experiment must be modified to perturb the system from its steady state, thereby generating dynamics. A scientifically plausible minimal modification is to perform a stop-synthesis experiment. Assume the system is initially at steady state, with $x(0) = \\alpha/\\delta$. The output $y(t) = x(0)$ is constant. At a time $t_1 > 0$, an agent (e.g., a transcriptional or translational inhibitor like rifampicin or tetracycline) is added that instantaneously forces the synthesis rate to zero.\nFor $t \\ge t_1$, the model becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = -\\delta x, \\quad x(t_1) = x(0) = \\alpha/\\delta\n$$\nThe solution for $t \\ge t_1$ is:\n$$\nx(t) = x(t_1) \\exp(-\\delta(t-t_1)) = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}\\right) \\exp(-\\delta(t-t_1))\n$$\nThe output $y(t)$ for $t \\ge t_1$ is an exponential decay curve. From this curve, one can unambiguously determine two parameters by fitting to the form $A \\exp(-b(t-t_1))$:\n1. The amplitude $A = y(t_1) = \\alpha/\\delta$.\n2. The decay rate $b = \\delta$.\nFrom a fit to the post-perturbation data, we directly obtain $\\delta$. Since we also obtain the value of the ratio $\\alpha/\\delta$ from the amplitude (or from the pre-perturbation steady-state measurement), we can calculate $\\alpha = \\delta \\cdot (\\alpha/\\delta)$. The initial condition $x(0)$ is also determined since it is equal to the ratio $\\alpha/\\delta$.\nTherefore, this modified experiment renders the triple $(\\alpha, \\delta, x(0))$ structurally identifiable even from a steady-state initial condition.\n\nFinally, for the check, under the nongeneric, uninformative initial condition, the output trajectory is constant in time, $y(t) = y_c$. The only relationship that can be extracted from this observation is that the system is at steady state, where $\\dot{x}=0$. This implies $\\alpha - \\delta x = 0$, or $x = \\alpha/\\delta$. Since $y=x$, the observed constant value is $y_c = \\alpha/\\delta$. The single structurally identifiable parameter combination is this ratio. The expression for this combination in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ is simply $\\alpha/\\delta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}}$$", "id": "2745423"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the single-state model, we now consider a two-stage process of gene expression, a common motif in synthetic circuits.

A parameter is structurally identifiable if its value can be uniquely determined from the measured outputs $y(t)$ and known inputs $u(t)$ over a given time interval, assuming perfect, noise-free measurements. The fundamental principle is to establish an algebraic relationship between the unknown parameter and the known/measurable quantities.\n\nThe measured output is $y(t) = h(x(t)) = x(t)$. Since $y(t)$ is assumed to be sufficiently smooth, we can differentiate it with respect to time $t$.

However, the output equation $y(t) = x(t)$ allows us to replace the state variable $x(t)$ with the measured output $y(t)$.\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = \\theta y(t)^{2} + u(t)\n$$\nThis equation provides a direct algebraic relationship between the unknown parameter $\\theta$ and the quantities that are known or can be measured: the input $u(t)$, the output $y(t)$, and the time derivative of the output $\\dot{y}(t)$. We can now solve for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta y(t)^{2} = \\dot{y}(t) - u(t)\n$$\nTo isolate $\\theta$, we must divide by $y(t)^{2}$. This operation is valid only under a specific regularity condition.\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\dot{y}(t) - u(t)}{y(t)^{2}}\n$$\nThe expression for $\\theta$ is valid at any time $t$ for which $y(t)^{2} \\neq 0$, which is equivalent to $y(t) \\neq 0$. For the parameter $\\theta$ to be identifiable, it is necessary that the system is excited in such a way that the output $y(t)$ is not identically zero over the measurement interval. If $y(t)$ were identically zero, the equation would become $0 = 0$, yielding no information about $\\theta$.\n\nSince a unique expression for $\\theta$ can be derived from the input-output data (provided the regularity condition holds), the parameter $\\theta$ is structurally locally identifiable. In fact, because the solution is unique and does not depend on a local approximation, it is structurally globally identifiable.\n\nThe required regularity condition is that the output $y(t)$ must not be zero.
