The rate of change of the complex concentration $x(t)$ is given by the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{on} a(t)b(t) - k_{off} x(t) $$\nFrom the conservation of mass, we have:\n$$ a(t) = A_0 - x(t) $$\n$$ b(t) = B_0 - x(t) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the rate equation gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $x(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{on} (A_0 - x)(B_0 - x) - k_{off} x $$\nExpanding the terms, we obtain a quadratic form:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{on} (A_0 B_0 - (A_0 + B_0)x + x^2) - k_{off} x $$\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{on} x^2 - (k_{on}(A_0 + B_0) + k_{off}) x + k_{on} A_0 B_0 $$\nThis is a first-order nonlinear ODE that can be solved by separation of variables.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the closed-form expression for $x(t)$**\n\nTo solve the ODE, we first find the roots of the quadratic polynomial on the right-hand side, which correspond to the steady-state concentrations ($dx/dt = 0$):\n$$ k_{on} x^2 - (k_{on}(A_0 + B_0) + k_{off}) x + k_{on} A_0 B_0 = 0 $$\nDividing by $k_{on}$ and defining the dissociation constant $K_D = k_{off}/k_{on}$, the equation becomes:\n$$ x^2 - (A_0 + B_0 + K_D) x + A_0 B_0 = 0 $$\nThe two roots, which we will denote $x_+$ and $x_-$, are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ x_{\\pm} = \\frac{(A_0 + B_0 + K_D) \\pm \\sqrt{(A_0 + B_0 + K_D)^2 - 4A_0 B_0}}{2} $$\nThe physically meaningful steady-state concentration, $x_{\\infty}$, must be less than both $A_0$ and $B_0$. This corresponds to the smaller root, $x_-$. The other root, $x_+$, is physically inaccessible. So, $x_{\\infty} = x_-$.\n\nThe ODE can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{k_{on}(x - x_+)(x - x_-)} = dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from $t=0$ to $t$ (corresponding to $x(0)=0$ to $x(t)$), using partial fraction decomposition:\n$$ \\int_0^{x(t)} \\frac{1}{(x' - x_+)(x' - x_-)} dx' = \\int_0^t k_{on} dt' $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{x_+ - x_-} \\int_0^{x(t)} \\left( \\frac{1}{x' - x_+} - \\frac{1}{x' - x_-} \\right) dx' = k_{on} t $$\nSince $0 \\le x(t) < x_- < x_+$, we have $|x'-x_-| = x_--x'$ and $|x'-x_+| = x_+-x'$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x_+ - x_-} \\left[ \\ln(x_+ - x') - \\ln(x_- - x') \\right]_0^{x(t)} = k_{on} t $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{x_+ - x_-} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_+ - x'}{x_- - x'}\\right) \\right]_0^{x(t)} = k_{on} t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_+ - x(t)}{x_- - x(t)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_+}{x_-}\\right) = k_{on} (x_+ - x_-) t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left( \\frac{x_-(x_+ - x(t))}{x_+(x_- - x(t))} \\right) = k_{on} (x_+ - x_-) t $$\nExponentiating both sides and solving for $x(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{x_-(x_+ - x(t))}{x_+(x_- - x(t))} = \\exp(k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t) $$\n$$ x_- x_+ - x_- x(t) = (x_+ x_- - x_+ x(t)) \\exp(k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t) $$\n$$ x(t) (x_+ \\exp(k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t) - x_-) = x_+ x_- (\\exp(k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t) - 1) $$\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{x_+ x_- (1 - \\exp(-k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t))}{x_+ - x_- \\exp(-k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t)} $$\nwhere $x_{\\pm}$ are defined as above. This is the closed-form expression for $x(t)$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the steady-state fraction $f_{\\infty}$**\n\nThe steady-state fraction of CRY2 in complex is $f_{\\infty} = x_{\\infty}/A_0$, where $x_{\\infty}$ is the steady-state concentration of the complex. As derived, $x_{\\infty}$ is the smaller root, $x_-$, of the quadratic equation $x^2 - (A_0 + B_0 + K_D) x + A_0 B_0 = 0$.\n\nFirst, we must work with consistent units.

The parameters provided are physically realistic. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $C(t)$ represent the normalized population of the membrane-localized complex at time $t$. The problem states that between input pulses, the population decays according to first-order kinetics. This process is described by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k_{off} C(t) $$\nwhere $k_{off}$ is the first-order off-rate constant, given as $k_{off} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the system's response to an input can be described as the convolution of the input signal with the system's impulse response, $h(t)$. The impulse response is the system's behavior following a single, instantaneous input pulse at time $t=0$. The problem states that such a pulse causes a \"normalized unit increment\" in the complex. This establishes the initial condition $C(0^+) = 1$.\n\nThe solution to the first-order decay equation, with the initial condition $C(0^+) = 1$, is:\n$$ C(t) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(-k_{off} t) $$\nTherefore, the impulse response of the system for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$ h(t) = \\exp(-k_{off} t) $$\n\nThe input is a periodic pulse train with period $T$. In the LTI framework, such an input, $x(t)$, can be modeled as an infinite series of Dirac delta functions:\n$$ x(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\delta(t - nT) $$\nThe problem requires us to find the total residual membrane-localized fraction in the steady state, immediately before a pulse. Let us evaluate the concentration at time $t=kT^-$ for a large integer $k$, which represents the moment just before the pulse at time $kT$. The concentration at this time is the superposition of the decaying responses from all previous pulses that occurred at times $0, T, 2T, \\dots, (k-1)T$.\n\nThe response from a single pulse at time $nT$ is given by $h(t - nT)$. The total concentration at time $t=kT^-$ from all prior pulses is the sum:\n$$ C(kT^-) = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} h(kT - nT) = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} \\exp(-k_{off}(kT - nT)) $$\nBy changing the index of summation to $m = k - n - 1$ (so that $n = k - 1 - m$), the sum can be re-indexed. When $n=0$, $m=k-1$. When $n=k-1$, $m=0$. The term in the exponent is $k_{off}(k - n)T = k_{off}(m+1)T$. The sum becomes:\n$$ C(kT^-) = \\sum_{m=0}^{k-1} \\exp(-k_{off}(m+1)T) $$\nIn the steady state, we consider the limit as $k \\to \\infty$.

Since $k_{off} > 0$ and $T > 0$, we have $0 < r < 1$, and the series converges to $\\frac{1}{1-r}$.\n$$ C_{residual} = \\exp(-k_{off}T) \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_{off}T)} \\right) = \\frac{\\exp(-k_{off}T)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{off}T)} $$\nThe \"no overlap\" criterion states that this residual fraction must be less than or equal to a specified value $\\epsilon = 0.05$. The peak response to a single pulse is unity, so the condition is:\n$$ C_{residual} \\le \\epsilon $$\n$$ \\frac{\\exp(-k_{off}T)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{off}T)} \\le \\epsilon $$\nWe must now solve this inequality for the period $T$. Since the denominator $1 - \\exp(-k_{off}T)$ is positive for $T > 0$, we can multiply both sides by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\exp(-k_{off}T) \\le \\epsilon \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{off}T)\\right) $$\n$$ \\exp(-k_{off}T) \\le \\epsilon - \\epsilon \\exp(-k_{off}T) $$\n$$ \\exp(-k_{off}T) + \\epsilon \\exp(-k_{off}T) \\le \\epsilon $$\n$$ (1 + \\epsilon)\\exp(-k_{off}T) \\le \\epsilon $$\n$$ \\exp(-k_{off}T) \\le \\frac{\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -k_{off}T \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}\\right) $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ k_{off}T \\ge -\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}\\right) $$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $-\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(b/a)$:\n$$ k_{off}T \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nFinally, the inequality that $T$ must satisfy is:\n$$ T \\ge \\frac{1}{k_{off}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nTo find the maximal stimulation frequency, $f_{max}$, we must find the minimum allowed period, $T_{min}$. This occurs when the inequality is an equality:\n$$ T_{min} = \\frac{1}{k_{off}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nThe frequency is $f = 1/T$. The maximal frequency is therefore $f_{max} = 1/T_{min}$:\n$$ f_{max} = \\frac{k_{off}}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\right)} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values, $k_{off} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $\\epsilon = 0.05$:\n$$ f_{max} = \\frac{0.02}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + 0.05}{0.05}\\right)} = \\frac{0.02}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1.05}{0.05}\\right)} = \\frac{0.02}{\\ln(21)} $$\nCalculating the value:\n$$ \\ln(21) \\approx 3.0445224377 $$\n$$ f_{max} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{3.0445224377} \\approx 0.00656911\\ \\mathrm{Hz} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement:\n$$ f_{max} \\approx 0.006569\\ \\mathrm{Hz} $$\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation as $6.569 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.569 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "2755570"}]}
