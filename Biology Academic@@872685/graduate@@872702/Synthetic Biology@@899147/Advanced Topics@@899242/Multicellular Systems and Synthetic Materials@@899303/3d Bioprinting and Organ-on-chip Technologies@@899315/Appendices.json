The problem is therefore deemed valid, and a complete solution will be presented.\n\nThe problem requires two primary tasks: first, to derive an expression connecting the experimentally measured rheological properties to the predicted die swell ratio, and second, to compute the final width of the printed hydrogel filament.\n\nFirst, we must verify that the provided rheological data are consistent with the single-mode Maxwell model, which is the linear viscoelastic basis for the non-linear Upper-Convected Maxwell (UCM) model used to describe the flow. The problem provides the following relations for the storage modulus $G'$ and loss modulus $G''$ for a single-mode Maxwell fluid:\n$$G'(\\omega) = G_{0}\\frac{\\omega^{2}\\lambda^{2}}{1+\\omega^{2}\\lambda^{2}}$$\n$$G''(\\omega) = G_{0}\\frac{\\omega\\lambda}{1+\\omega^{2}\\lambda^{2}}$$\nHere, $G_{0}$ is the plateau modulus, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\lambda$ is the relaxation time.

This consistency confirms that the single-mode Maxwell model is an appropriate description for the bioink's rheological behavior under these conditions, which in turn justifies the use of the UCM model for the steady shear extrusion process.\n\nNow we proceed to derive the expression for the die swell ratio, $B$. We begin with the provided Tanner–Barus relation:\n$$B = 1 + c_{B}\\frac{N_{1w}}{2\\tau_{w}}$$\nwhere $N_{1w}$ is the first normal stress difference at the nozzle wall, $\\tau_{w}$ is the shear stress at the wall, and $c_{B} = 1.5$ is a given empirical constant. The ratio $\\frac{N_{1w}}{2\\tau_{w}}$ represents the recoverable shear strain at the wall.\n\nFor a UCM fluid in steady shear, the constitutive relations for $N_{1}$ and shear stress $\\tau$ are given as:\n$$N_{1} = 2\\eta_{0}\\lambda\\,\\dot{\\gamma}^{2}$$\n$$\\tau = \\eta_{0}\\,\\dot{\\gamma}$$\nwhere $\\eta_0$ is the zero-shear viscosity and $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the shear rate. At the wall, these become $N_{1w} = 2\\eta_{0}\\lambda\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{w}^{2}$ and $\\tau_{w} = \\eta_{0}\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{w}$. Substituting these into the Tanner–Barus relation:\n$$B = 1 + c_{B}\\frac{2\\eta_{0}\\lambda\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{w}^{2}}{2(\\eta_{0}\\dot{\\gamma}_{w})} = 1 + c_{B}\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}_{w}$$\nThis equation provides a direct relationship between the die swell ratio $B$, the material's relaxation time $\\lambda$, and the shear rate at the wall $\\dot{\\gamma}_{w}$.\n\nThe wall shear rate for a Newtonian-like fluid in a circular capillary is given as:\n$$\\dot{\\gamma}_{w} = \\frac{4Q}{\\pi R^{3}}$$\nwhere $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate and $R$ is the nozzle radius. Substituting this into our expression for $B$:\n$$B = 1 + c_{B}\\lambda\\frac{4Q}{\\pi R^{3}}$$\nThis is the final derived expression that connects the material property $\\lambda$ (validated by $G'$ and $G''$ measurements) and the process parameters ($Q$, $R$) to the die swell ratio $B$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the printed feature width $W$.

The constraints are self-consistent and sufficient.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, quantitative, and free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as dictated.\n\n1. Derivation of Interstitial Velocity, $u$.\nDarcy's law for one-dimensional flow relates the superficial velocity $u$ to the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ through the medium's permeability $k$ and the fluid's dynamic viscosity $\\mu$:\n$$ u = - \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nFor a homogeneous porous slab of length $L$ with a steady pressure drop $\\Delta p$ across it, the pressure gradient is assumed to be constant. The flow is driven from a region of high pressure to low pressure, so the gradient is negative with respect to the direction of flow. We can approximate the gradient as:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} $$\nSubstituting this into Darcy's law yields the expression for the interstitial velocity:\n$$ u = - \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} \\right) = \\frac{k \\Delta p}{\\mu L} $$\n\n2. Derivation of Shear Stress, $\\tau$.\nThe problem specifies that the local shear stress $\\tau$ experienced by cells scales with the viscosity $\\mu$ and a characteristic shear rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}$. The shear rate is estimated as the ratio of a characteristic velocity to a characteristic length scale. For flow in a porous medium, the appropriate velocity scale is the superficial velocity $u$, and the length scale is the characteristic pore size $a$. Therefore, the shear rate is estimated as:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma} \\sim \\frac{u}{a} $$\nThe shear stress is the product of viscosity and shear rate. Adopting this scaling relation as an equality for estimation purposes gives:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{\\mu u}{a} $$\n\n3. Derivation of Drift Speed, $v_b$.\nThe problem states that the cellular drift speed $v_b$ due to mechanotaxis is directly proportional to the local shear stress $\\tau$. The constant of proportionality is the mechanosensitivity coefficient $s$. The relationship is thus:\n$$ v_b = s \\tau $$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $\\tau$:\n$$ v_b = s \\left( \\frac{\\mu u}{a} \\right) $$\nAnd further substituting the expression for $u$:\n$$ v_b = s \\frac{\\mu}{a} \\left( \\frac{k \\Delta p}{\\mu L} \\right) = \\frac{s k \\Delta p}{a L} $$\n\n4. Derivation of Migration Bias Index, $B$.\nThe one-dimensional displacement $X(T)$ of a cell after an observation time $T$ is modeled by an advection-diffusion process. This process corresponds to a biased random walk. For constant drift velocity $v_b$ and constant diffusivity $D_c$, the probability distribution of the displacement $X(T)$ is a Gaussian distribution, $X(T) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_X, \\sigma_X^2)$, with mean and variance given by:\n$$ \\mu_X = v_b T $$\n$$ \\sigma_X^2 = 2 D_c T $$\nThe probability of a positive net displacement, $P_{\\text{down}}$, is $P(X(T)  0)$. To compute this, we standardize the variable $X(T)$. Let $Z = \\frac{X(T) - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}$ be the standard normal variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$$ P(X(T)  0) = P\\left( \\frac{X(T) - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}  \\frac{0 - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\right) = P\\left( Z  -\\frac{\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\right) $$\nBy the symmetry property of the standard normal distribution, $P(Z  -z) = P(Z  z) = \\Phi(z)$, where $\\Phi(z)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. In our case, $z = \\frac{\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} = \\frac{v_b T}{\\sqrt{2 D_c T}} = \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{\\sqrt{2 D_c}} $$\nTherefore, $P_{\\text{down}} = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{\\sqrt{2 D_c}}\\right)$. The CDF $\\Phi(z)$ is related to the error function, $\\text{erf}(x)$, by the identity $\\Phi(z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[1 + \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right]$. Applying this identity:\n$$ P_{\\text{down}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{\\sqrt{2 D_c}} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{2 \\sqrt{D_c}} \\right) \\right] $$\nThe migration bias index $B$ is defined as $B = 2 P_{\\text{down}} - 1$. Substituting the expression for $P_{\\text{down}}$:\n$$ B = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{2 \\sqrt{D_c}} \\right) \\right] \\right) - 1 $$\n$$ B = \\left( 1 + \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{2 \\sqrt{D_c}} \\right) \\right) - 1 $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the bias index:\n$$ B = \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{v_b \\sqrt{T}}{2 \\sqrt{D_c}} \\right) $$\nThe computational implementation will be a direct translation of these derived analytical expressions.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import erf\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of calculating interstitial velocity, shear stress,\n    and cell migration bias index in a bioprinted hydrogel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains: (k, mu, delta_p, L, a, s, Dc, T) in SI units.\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0e-14, 1.0e-3, 100, 1.0e-3, 5.0e-6, 1.0e-5, 1.0e-12, 3600),\n        (1.0e-14, 1.0e-3, 0, 1.0e-3, 5.0e-6, 1.0e-5, 1.0e-12, 3600),\n        (1.0e-15, 1.5e-3, 200, 1.5e-3, 3.0e-6, 2.0e-5, 5.0e-13, 7200),\n        (2.0e-14, 3.0e-3, 300, 2.0e-3, 6.0e-6, 0.5e-5, 1.5e-12, 5400),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        k, mu, delta_p, L, a, s, Dc, T = case\n\n        # 1.
