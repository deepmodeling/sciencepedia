In this case, the domain for $k_{\\text{off}}$ is $[0, \\infty)$, and the leftmost point is $k_{\\text{off}} = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the activation probability $P_{\\text{act}}(k_{\\text{off}})$ is maximized at the minimum possible value of $k_{\\text{off}}$. The value that maximizes $P_{\\text{act}}$ is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nPhysically, this result is intuitive. The activation probability represents the success of cleavage against the competing process of dissociation. By setting the dissociation rate $k_{\\text{off}}$ to $0$, we eliminate the competing pathway. With the assumption that eventual cleavage is certain if the bond persists ($\\int_{0}^{\\infty} h_{c}(t)\\,dt = \\infty$), the probability of activation becomes unity when dissociation is impossible.
