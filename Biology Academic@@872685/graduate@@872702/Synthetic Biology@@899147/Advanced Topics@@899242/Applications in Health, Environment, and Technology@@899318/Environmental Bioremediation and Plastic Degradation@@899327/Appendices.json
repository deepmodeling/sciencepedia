It describes a classic surface erosion phenomenon based on mass conservation, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique solution. The scenario is a direct application of enzyme kinetics to materials science, a valid interdisciplinary problem. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the film thinning rate, $v$, based on the principle of mass conservation at the receding PET-water interface. Let us consider a small, representative planar area $A$ of the PET film. The mass of a differential layer of thickness $dL$ over this area is given by $dm$:\n$$dm = \\rho \\cdot dV = \\rho \\cdot A \\cdot dL$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density of the solid PET. The rate of change of mass of the film due to erosion is therefore:\n$$\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\rho A \\frac{dL}{dt}$$\nThis rate of mass loss must be equal to the rate at which mass is removed from the surface by the enzymatic action of the biofilm. The problem provides the surface molar flux of PET repeat units, $k_{s}$, with units of $\\text{mol}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. To convert this molar flux to a mass flux, $J_{m}$, we must multiply by the molar mass of the repeat unit, $M_{\\text{rep}}$:\n$$J_{m} = k_{s} \\cdot M_{\\text{rep}}$$\nThe total mass of PET removed from the area $A$ per unit time is the mass flux multiplied by the area:\n$$\\text{Rate of mass removal} = J_{m} \\cdot A = (k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}) A$$\nBy conservation of mass, the rate of mass loss from the film, which is $-\\frac{dm}{dt}$ (the negative sign indicates a decrease in mass), must equal the rate of mass removal from the surface.\n$$-\\frac{dm}{dt} = (k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}) A$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{dm}{dt}$:\n$$-\\left(\\rho A \\frac{dL}{dt}\\right) = k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}} A$$\nThe area $A$ is a common factor on both sides and cancels, which is expected for a process of uniform erosion over a large sheet:\n$$-\\rho \\frac{dL}{dt} = k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}$$\nThe problem defines the thinning rate as $v = -\\frac{dL}{dt}$. Substituting this definition into our equation yields:\n$$\\rho v = k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}$$\nSolving for the thinning rate $v$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$v = \\frac{k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}}{\\rho}$$\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically.

We will use grams ($g$), meters ($m$), and seconds ($s$).\nFirst, convert the density $\\rho$ to units of $\\text{g}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}$:\n$$\\rho = 1.38\\ \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{cm}^{3}} = 1.38\\ \\frac{\\text{g}}{(10^{-2}\\ \\text{m})^{3}} = 1.38\\ \\frac{\\text{g}}{10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}^{3}} = 1.38 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{g}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}$$\nNow substitute the values into the derived expression for $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{mol}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (192.17\\ \\text{g}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1})}{1.38 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{g}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}}$$\nThe numerator evaluates to the mass flux $J_{m}$:\n$$J_{m} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\cdot 192.17 \\approx 2.88255 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{g}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nNow compute $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{2.88255 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{g}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{1.38 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{g}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}} \\approx 2.0888 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{m}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of micrometers per day ($\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{day}$).

Our derived expression is $v = \\frac{k_{s} M_{\\text{rep}}}{\\rho}$. The molar mass $M_{\\text{rep}}$ and density $\\rho$ are intrinsic material properties, assumed constant. Therefore, the thinning rate $v$ is constant if and only if the surface molar flux $k_{s}$ is constant. The problem statement specifies that the system is under \"saturating substrate conditions.\" In the context of enzyme kinetics, which governs this system, this corresponds to the regime where the substrate concentration is much greater than the Michaelis-Menten constant, $K_{M}$. For a surface reaction, the \"substrate\" is the available surface area of PET. Saturation implies that the enzymatic depolymerization rate per unit area does not depend on the amount of material remaining (i.e., the thickness $L$), but is proceeding at its maximum possible velocity, $V_{\\text{max}}$. Under these conditions, the rate of monomer release per unit area, $k_{s}$, is constant. This leads to a constant thinning velocity $v$, corresponding to a zero-order dependence on film thickness, described by the differential equation $\\frac{dL}{dt} = -v$. This approximation is valid as long as the surface remains saturated, the biofilm's enzymatic activity is steady, and there are no significant changes to the surface morphology or chemistry that would inhibit the reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.805}$$", "id": "2737045"}, {"introduction": "Once depolymerization releases monomers like terephthalic acid (TPA) into the environment, the engineered microbes must efficiently catabolize them.

Assume steady state, no storage or biomass formation, and that TPA catabolism proceeds to complete mineralization (that is, all carbon is released as $CO_{2}$ and all hydrogen ends as $H_{2}O$). The culture’s substrate uptake is constrained by the reactor feed to exactly $1.00$ mmol TPA per gram dry weight per hour ($1.00$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$). Oxygen is supplied in excess relative to gas–liquid transfer, so the intracellular oxygen uptake rate (oxygen uptake rate (OUR)) is the potential bottleneck.\n\nStarting from elemental conservation and the requirement that complete oxidation of $C_{8}H_{6}O_{4}$ yields only $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$, derive the stoichiometric coefficient of $O_{2}$ needed per mole of TPA oxidized.

It is a standard problem in metabolic engineering and stoichiometry. We will therefore proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe first task is to determine the stoichiometric coefficient for the complete aerobic mineralization of terephthalic acid (TPA), which has the chemical formula $C_{8}H_{6}O_{4}$. The problem specifies that the only products are carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$) and water ($H_{2}O$). We can write the unbalanced chemical reaction as:\n$$C_{8}H_{6}O_{4} + \\nu_{O_{2}} O_{2} \\rightarrow \\nu_{CO_{2}} CO_{2} + \\nu_{H_{2}O} H_{2}O$$\nwhere $\\nu_{i}$ represents the stoichiometric coefficient for species $i$.\n\nWe balance this equation by conserving the number of atoms for each element on both sides of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Carbon (C) conservation**: There are $8$ atoms of carbon in one molecule of TPA. To conserve carbon, all $8$ atoms must be converted to $CO_{2}$. Therefore:\n    $$\\nu_{CO_{2}} = 8$$\n\n2.  **Hydrogen (H) conservation**: There are $6$ atoms of hydrogen in one molecule of TPA. These are converted to water ($H_{2}O$), which contains $2$ hydrogen atoms per molecule. Thus:\n    $$6 = 2 \\cdot \\nu_{H_{2}O}$$\n    $$\\nu_{H_{2}O} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$$\n\n3.  **Oxygen (O) conservation**: Now we balance the oxygen atoms. On the reactant side, we have $4$ atoms from TPA and $2 \\cdot \\nu_{O_{2}}$ atoms from molecular oxygen. On the product side, we have $2 \\cdot \\nu_{CO_{2}}$ atoms from carbon dioxide and $1 \\cdot \\nu_{H_{2}O}$ atoms from water. The balance is:\n    $$4 + 2 \\cdot \\nu_{O_{2}} = 2 \\cdot \\nu_{CO_{2}} + \\nu_{H_{2}O}$$\n    Substituting the values for $\\nu_{CO_{2}}$ and $\\nu_{H_{2}O}$ we just found:\n    $$4 + 2 \\cdot \\nu_{O_{2}} = 2 \\cdot (8) + 3$$\n    $$4 + 2 \\cdot \\nu_{O_{2}} = 16 + 3$$\n    $$4 + 2 \\cdot \\nu_{O_{2}} = 19$$\n    $$2 \\cdot \\nu_{O_{2}} = 19 - 4 = 15$$\n    $$\\nu_{O_{2}} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5$$\n\nThe stoichiometric coefficient of $O_{2}$ required per mole of TPA is $7.5$. The fully balanced equation is:\n$$C_{8}H_{6}O_{4} + 7.5 O_{2} \\rightarrow 8 CO_{2} + 3 H_{2}O$$\n\nThe second task is to calculate the maximum oxygen uptake rate ($v_{O_{2}}$) required to sustain complete mineralization given a TPA uptake rate ($v_{TPA}$) of $1.00$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$. The problem states no biomass is formed and there is no intracellular storage, so all consumed TPA is catabolized. The required oxygen uptake rate is stoichiometrically linked to the TPA uptake rate.\n\nThe relationship is:\n$$v_{O_{2}} = v_{TPA} \\times \\nu_{O_{2}}$$\nGiven:\n$$v_{TPA} = 1.00 \\text{ mmol gDW}^{-1} \\text{h}^{-1}$$\nUsing the derived stoichiometric coefficient $\\nu_{O_{2}} = 7.5$:\n$$v_{O_{2}} = (1.00 \\text{ mmol gDW}^{-1} \\text{h}^{-1}) \\times 7.5$$\n$$v_{O_{2}} = 7.50 \\text{ mmol gDW}^{-1} \\text{h}^{-1}$$\nThe input value $1.00$ has three significant figures, and the stoichiometric coefficient is an exact number. Therefore, the result must be reported to three significant figures.\n\nThe final task is a qualitative justification based on first principles. Flux balance analysis (FBA) operates on the principle of a steady state, where the production and consumption of each internal metabolite are balanced. This is expressed by the matrix equation $S \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\vec{0}$, where $S$ is the stoichiometric matrix and $\\vec{v}$ is the vector of metabolic fluxes.\nComplete oxidation of an organic substrate such as TPA is the most energetically favorable catabolic process. It involves the transfer of electrons from the substrate to an electron transport chain, with $O_{2}$ acting as the terminal electron acceptor. This process regenerates oxidized cofactors (e.g., $NAD^{+}$, $FAD$) from their reduced forms (e.g., $NADH$, $FADH_{2}$), which are essential for the catabolic pathways (e.g., Krebs cycle) to continue operating.\n\nIf the oxygen uptake rate is bounded, $v_{O_{2}}  7.50$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$, while the TPA uptake remains fixed at $v_{TPA} = 1.00$ mmol gDW$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$, the cell faces a critical problem: a redox imbalance. There is insufficient $O_{2}$ to accept all electrons liberated from the complete oxidation of the consumed TPA. Consequently, the electron transport chain cannot re-oxidize all the $NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$ produced. The cellular pool of oxidized cofactors ($NAD^{+}$, $FAD$) would be depleted, while the pool of reduced cofactors ($NADH$, $FADH_{2}$) would accumulate. This would inhibit cofactor-dependent dehydrogenases in central metabolism, halting catabolism and violating the steady-state assumption.\n\nTo maintain a steady state ($S \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\vec{0}$), the metabolic network must re-route fluxes to alternative pathways that consume reducing equivalents without using oxygen. This is the fundamental principle of fermentation or overflow metabolism. The optimal flux distribution, as would be predicted by FBA, would exhibit the following adaptations:\n1.  **Incomplete Oxidation**: Flux through the full Krebs cycle and terminal oxidative phosphorylation would decrease. Carbon skeletons derived from TPA would not be fully oxidized to $CO_{2}$.\n2.  **Secretion of Byproducts**: To dispose of excess carbon and electrons, the cell will synthesize and secrete partially oxidized fermentation products. Common byproducts include acetate, lactate, succinate, or ethanol. The synthesis of these compounds from intermediates of central metabolism (e.g., pyruvate, acetyl-CoA) requires the consumption of $NADH$, thereby regenerating the $NAD^{+}$ necessary to sustain glycolysis and other upstream catabolic reactions.\n3.  **Redox Cofactor Balance**: The overall flux distribution will shift to ensure the net production rate of reduced cofactors is exactly balanced by their consumption rate through both the limited aerobic respiration and the newly activated anaerobic (fermentative) pathways. The result is a less efficient metabolism, as the carbon and energy stored in the secreted byproducts are lost to the cell.\n\nIn summary, an oxygen uptake constraint below the stoichiometric requirement forces a metabolic shift away from complete mineralization. The system sacrifices carbon efficiency to maintain redox homeostasis, a non-negotiable requirement for sustained metabolic activity at steady state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.50}\n$$", "id": "2737084"}, {"introduction": "A powerful synthetic biology design is only viable if it is evolutionarily stable, especially in systems involving cooperative behaviors like the secretion of public goods.

The problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive, from first principles, the equilibrium frequency of a non-secreting mutant allele in a population of secreting wild-type organisms. Let $q$ denote the frequency of the non-secreting mutant allele and $p$ denote the frequency of the secreting wild-type allele. Since there are only two alleles in the model, their frequencies must sum to one: $p + q = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that the wild type has a relative fitness of $w_{wt} = 1$, and the non-secreting mutant has a relative fitness of $w_{mut} = 1 - s$, where $s = 0.02$ is the selection coefficient against the mutant. The population reproduces in discrete, non-overlapping generations. The evolution of the allele frequency within one generation can be modeled as a sequence of two processes: selection and mutation.\n\nFirst, we apply selection. The frequency of each allele in the pool of successful reproducers is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness. The frequency of the mutant allele after selection, which we will call $q^*$, is given by its proportional contribution to the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$.\n$$ \\bar{w} = p \\cdot w_{wt} + q \\cdot w_{mut} = (1-q)(1) + q(1-s) = 1 - q + q - qs = 1 - qs $$\nThe frequency of the mutant allele after selection is:\n$$ q^* = \\frac{q \\cdot w_{mut}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{q(1-s)}{1-qs} $$\nThe frequency of the wild-type allele after selection is similarly:\n$$ p^* = \\frac{p \\cdot w_{wt}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{1-q}{1-qs} $$\n\nNext, we apply mutation. The wild-type allele mutates to the mutant allele at a rate of $\\mu = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ per generation. The problem specifies to ignore back mutation. Therefore, a fraction $\\mu$ of the post-selection wild-type frequency $p^*$ is converted to the mutant type.
