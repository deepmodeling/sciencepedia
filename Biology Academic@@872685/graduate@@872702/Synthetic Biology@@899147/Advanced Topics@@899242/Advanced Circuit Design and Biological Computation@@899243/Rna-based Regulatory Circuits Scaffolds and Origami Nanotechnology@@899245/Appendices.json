Specifically, $[G]_{0} = 500\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $[T]_{0} = 5.00\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of $T$ changes significantly, while the concentration of $G$ changes by at most $5.00\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, which is only $1\\%$ of its initial value.

Under this condition, the amount of trigger bound to the scaffold is negligible compared to the total amount of trigger. Therefore, the free concentration of each trigger is approximately equal to its total concentration: $[T_k]_{\\text{free}} \\approx c$ for $k=1, 2, 3$.\n\nSubstituting $[T_k]_{\\text{free}} = c$ and the expression for $K_{A, ij}$:\n$$ \\pi_{i \\leftarrow j} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{c^{\\circ}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{ij}^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right)\\right) c}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{c^{\\circ}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{kj}^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right)\\right) c\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{c}{c^{\\circ}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{ij}^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right)}{1 + \\frac{c}{c^{\\circ}} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{kj}^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThis is the final expression for the occupancy probability.
