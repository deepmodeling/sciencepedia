To achieve this, we must eliminate the terms for the concentrations of free sites, $[S]$, and bound complexes, $[TS]$, from the definition of $\\theta$ by using the relationship provided by the definition of $K_{d}$.\n\nWe begin with the definition of occupancy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[TS]}{[S] + [TS]}$$\n\nTo make $\\theta$ independent of the absolute concentrations $[S]$ and $[TS]$, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $[TS]$.

Assume the specific end presents $L$ identical and independent microscopic binding positions for transposase monomers. Productive transposition requires exactly $n$ monomers ($n \\leq L$) to be bound at the end in a particular configuration; if more than $n$ monomers occupy the end, the complex is nonproductive due to steric occlusion and kinetic trapping.

The rate is given as being proportional to $P_n$, the probability of having exactly $n$ monomers bound to a specific end.\nThe problem is a chain of dependencies: the rate depends on $P_n$, which depends on the specific-site occupancy probability $p$. The probability $p$ depends on the free transposase concentration $[T]_{\\mathrm{free}}$, which in turn is related to the total transposase concentration $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ through a mass conservation law.\n\nThe overall strategy is to first find the optimal probability, $p^{\\ast}$, that maximizes $P_n$.

The binomial coefficient $\\binom{L}{n}$ is a positive constant, so we need only maximize the function $f(p) = p^{n} (1 - p)^{L - n}$ for $p \\in [0, 1]$.

Biophysical measurements indicate that the transposase can still bind, albeit weakly, when the seed matches within a Hamming distance of at most $t = 1$ (that is, up to $1$ mismatch within the $s$-mer). Assume a simple null model in which the cargo sequence is an independent and identically distributed random string with uniform base composition, and assume the following: (i) a hybrid synapse between one authentic TIR end and one internal seed-like site can form regardless of distance along the cargo; (ii) an internal–internal synapse can form if two seed-like sites occur in inverted orientation with linear separation $d$ in the range $20 \\le d \\le 500 \\,\\mathrm{bp}$; and (iii) the synaptic complex requires two inverted seed-like sites (either one authentic plus one internal, or two internal) to nucleate aberrant cleavage.\n\nGround your reasoning in the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA to RNA to protein), the definition of DNA sequence recognition by DNA-binding proteins, the cut-and-paste transposition mechanism requiring two inverted repeats to assemble a synaptic complex, and the well-tested probabilistic fact that, under a uniform independent base model, the probability that a specific $k$-mer occurs at a given position is approximately $4^{-k}$ and that expected counts are obtained by multiplying per-position probabilities by the number of positions.\n\nWhich option best (i) predicts the dominant class(es) of aberrant transposition events caused by internal TIR-like sequences under this model and (ii) proposes a sequence-design rule that, with quantitative justification, reduces the expected number of such events per cargo below $0.01$?\n\nA. Internal seed-like sites can pair with an authentic TIR to form hybrid synapses that yield truncated transposon insertions; two internal seed-like sites in inverted orientation and separated by $20 \\le d \\le 500 \\,\\mathrm{bp}$ can synapse to excise or mobilize internal fragments. To minimize these, recode the cargo (via synonymous substitutions and non-coding sequence redesign) to eliminate every internal $s$-mer within Hamming distance $\\le 1$ of the TIR seed across the entire cargo and additionally enforce an “inverted-pair exclusion” so that no two such motifs exist in reverse-complement orientation with $20 \\le d \\le 500 \\,\\mathrm{bp}$.

The transposase assembles a synaptic complex by binding two inverted repeat elements, one at each end of the transposon. Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) provide high-specificity anchors; however, the protein’s DNA-binding interface often recognizes a shorter “seed” within the TIR. If the transposase can engage sites with up to a small number of mismatches in that seed, then internal seed-like sequences can misdirect synapsis. Two general aberrant geometries follow from the requirement of two inverted sites: (i) a hybrid synapse between one authentic TIR and one internal seed-like site can generate truncated transposon insertions; and (ii) two internal seed-like sites in inverted orientation and within a synapsis-permissive spacing can synapse and mobilize or delete internal fragments. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology allows synonymous recoding of coding regions (altering DNA sequence while preserving protein sequence), which is a core method to remove undesired DNA motifs without changing function.\n\nUnder a uniform independent base model, the probability that a specific $k$-mer occurs at a given position is $4^{-k}$.

Its design rule eliminates every internal $s$-mer within Hamming distance $\\le 1$ of the seed. Under the stated model, that sets $p_{\\le 1}' = 0$, hence $E_{\\mathrm{int}}' = L \\, p_{\\le 1}' = 0$, which collapses the expected number of hybrid synapses to $0$. Because $E_{\\mathrm{pairs}}'$ scales with $N'^2$ and $N' = L \\, p_{\\le 1}' = 0$, it also yields $E_{\\mathrm{pairs}}' = 0$. The inverted-pair exclusion is an additional conservative constraint that protects against any residual weaker recognition beyond the assumed tolerance and against model deviations, but under the given model it is not even needed to satisfy the $< 0.01$ target. The mechanism-anchored prediction and the quantitatively justified design rule together meet the requirement. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: Adding high-affinity decoy seed motifs increases the expected internal count $N$ by design. Because both $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{pairs}}$ are non-decreasing functions of $N$ (indeed, $E_{\\mathrm{pairs}} \\propto N^2$), this strategy increases, rather than decreases, the expected number of aberrant synapses. It directly contradicts the goal of reducing events below $0.01$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: A global increase in guanine–cytosine content does not guarantee a reduction in the probability of near-matches to an arbitrary seed. The per-position probability depends on the seed composition; without matching the base frequencies to the actual seed, uniform shifts can leave $p_{\\le 1}$ almost unchanged or even increase it for guanine–cytosine-rich seeds. Moreover, reducing $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ from $\\approx 1.28$ to $< 0.01$ requires a reduction factor $> 100$, which cannot be generally achieved by modest base-composition shifts while preserving coding and regulatory function. This lacks quantitative guarantee under the given model. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Transcriptional terminators and insulators act at the RNA or transcriptional level and do not alter the DNA sequence features that the transposase recognizes to assemble synaptic complexes. They do not change $p_{\\le 1}$, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$, or $E_{\\mathrm{pairs}}$ under the stated model. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption E: Removing only exact matches eliminates the $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^9$ term but leaves the much larger one-mismatch contribution. With exact matches removed, the residual probability is\n$$\np_{\\text{resid}} = \\binom{9}{1} \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^8 \\approx 1.030 \\times 10^{-4},\n$$\nand the expected number of internal sites is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{int,resid}} \\approx L \\, p_{\\text{resid}} \\approx (1.2 \\times 10^4) \\times (1.030 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx 1.24,\n$$\nwhich still far exceeds $0.01$. Internal–internal expectations remain on the order of $10^{-2}$ as well. Thus, this rule is quantitatively insufficient. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A both correctly predicts the aberrant mechanisms and supplies a quantitatively justified design rule that reduces the expected count below the required threshold under the stated assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2751811"}]}
