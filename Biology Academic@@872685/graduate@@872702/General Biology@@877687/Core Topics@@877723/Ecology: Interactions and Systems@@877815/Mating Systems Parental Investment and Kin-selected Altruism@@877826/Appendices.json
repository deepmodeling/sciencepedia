The coefficient of relatedness between two individuals, denoted by $r(A,B)$, is the probability that a randomly chosen allele at a randomly chosen autosomal locus in individual $A$ is IBD to a randomly chosen allele at the same locus in individual $B$. Assume the following foundational principles: (i) Mendelian segregation, such that each meiosis transmits each autosomal allele with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$; (ii) the founders are outbred and mutually unrelated, so that the inbreeding coefficient of any founding ancestor is $F=0$; and (iii) independent assortment across loci and no sex-specific transmission bias for autosomes.\n\nUsing only these principles, and the logic that any IBD sharing between two non-inbred individuals must be traceable through paths connecting them via shared ancestors, compute $r$ by enumerating and summing the contributions of all distinct minimal genealogical paths between the focal pair, where each meiosis along a path contributes a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nCompute $r$ for the following three relationships under the stated assumptions:\n- full siblings (shared mother and father),\n- half siblings (shared mother only; fathers unrelated to each other and to the mother),\n- first cousins (their parents are full siblings; no other shared ancestry, that is, not double cousins).\n\nExpress your final answer as exact rational numbers, in the order [full siblings, half siblings, first cousins], as a single row matrix.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Mendelian genetics, is well-posed with a clear and mathematically tractable objective, and provides all necessary assumptions, such as diploidy, autosomal inheritance, and an outbred, unrelated founder population. The methodology is explicitly prescribed. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the coefficient of relatedness, $r$, between pairs of individuals. The calculation must follow the method of path analysis. For two non-inbred individuals, $X$ and $Y$, with non-inbred common ancestors, the coefficient of relatedness $r(X,Y)$ is the sum of probabilities over all possible genealogical paths connecting them. Each path must proceed from one individual, say $X$, up to a common ancestor, $A$, and then down to the other individual, $Y$. The contribution of each such path is given by $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$, where $n$ is the total number of meiotic steps in the path.

A rare, heritable behavioral variant allows an actor to incur a direct fitness cost of magnitude $c0$ to inflict a harm of magnitude $b0$ on a single, specific competitor. By experimental design, recipients of this harm are drawn from a pool that systematically excludes the actor’s close kin (for example, immigrants that displace the actor’s neighbors), such that the genetic relatedness between actor and harmed recipient (the regression coefficient of recipient genotype on actor genotype) is negative, $r0$. Assume effects are additive on expected reproductive output and that the only direct effects of the act are the actor’s own cost and the primary recipient’s decrement.\n\nUsing the inclusive fitness framework in which the change in an actor’s inclusive fitness equals the relatedness-weighted sum of the actor’s effects on others plus the actor’s own direct effect, determine which option correctly states the condition under which this spiteful act is favored by natural selection and provides a numerically consistent, biologically plausible example.

The recipient's fitness change is explicitly defined as $-b$.\n-   Relatedness: The genetic relatedness between the actor and the harmed recipient is negative, $r  0$. $r$ is the regression coefficient of recipient genotype on actor genotype.\n-   Framework: Inclusive fitness. The change in inclusive fitness ($\\Delta W_{IF}$) is the sum of the actor's own direct effect and the relatedness-weighted sum of the actor's effects on others.\n-   Assumption: Fitness effects are additive. The only direct effects are the cost to the actor ($-c$) and the harm to the recipient ($-b$).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is well-defined within the theoretical framework of social evolution and inclusive fitness. The concept of spite, defined as an action that is costly to the actor ($c0$) and detrimental to the recipient (effect is $-b$ where $b0$), is a standard topic. The evolution of such a trait requires special conditions, which the problem asks us to identify. The condition of negative relatedness ($r0$) is the key mechanism by which spite can be favored by natural selection. This arises in structured populations with local competition, where harming a competitor who is less related to the actor than the population average can indirectly free up resources for the actor's relatives. The problem statement is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and provides all necessary variables and definitions to proceed. It is a valid problem.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Condition for Selection**\nThe problem directs us to use the inclusive fitness framework. The change in an actor's inclusive fitness, $\\Delta W_{IF}$, is the sum of the fitness effect on the actor, weighted by its relatedness to itself (which is $1$), plus the fitness effects on other individuals, each weighted by the actor's relatedness to them.\n\nThe problem simplifies this to: \"the change in an actor’s inclusive fitness equals the relatedness-weighted sum of the actor’s effects on others plus the actor’s own direct effect.\"\n\nThe direct effect on the actor's fitness is the cost incurred, which is $-c$.\nThere is a single recipient of the action. The effect on this recipient's fitness is $-b$.\nThe relatedness of the actor to this recipient is $r$.\n\nFollowing the provided definition, the change in the actor's inclusive fitness is:\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = (\\text{direct effect on actor}) + r \\times (\\text{effect on recipient}) $$\nSubstituting the given terms:\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -c + r(-b) $$\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -c - rb $$\nNatural selection favors this spiteful behavior if and only if the change in inclusive fitness is positive:\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF}  0 $$\n$$ -c - rb  0 $$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to state the condition under which the benefit of the action outweighs its cost:\n$$ -rb  c $$\nThis is the correct formulation of Hamilton's rule for a spiteful act. For this inequality to be satisfied, given that $b  0$ and $c  0$, the relatedness $r$ must be negative ($r  0$), which is consistent with the problem's premises. The term $-rb$ represents the indirect fitness benefit gained by harming a negatively related competitor.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The act is favored when $rb - c  0$ because the actor’s harm to a negatively related recipient is discounted; for example, with $r=-0.25$, $b=3$, and $c=0.2$, the condition holds.**\n\nThe proposed condition is $rb - c  0$. This is fundamentally incorrect. Our derivation from first principles yields $-rb - c  0$, or $-rb  c$. The sign of the benefit term is inverted.\nLet us examine the provided numerical example: $r=-0.25$, $b=3$, $c=0.2$.\nAccording to the condition stated in this option, $rb - c  0$:\n$$ (-0.25)(3) - 0.2 = -0.75 - 0.2 = -0.95 $$\nThe result $-0.95$ is not greater than $0$. The numerical example contradicts the very condition it purports to satisfy.\nFurthermore, if we test these numbers with the *correct* condition, $-rb  c$:\n$$ -(-0.25)(3)  0.2 \\implies 0.75  0.2 $$\nThis is true. The numbers describe a scenario where spite would be favored, but the condition provided in the option is wrong, and the example is inconsistent with that wrong condition.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. The act is favored when $-r b  c$ because the relatedness-weighted effect on the recipient is $r(-b)$; for example, with $r=-0.15$, $b=8$, and $c=0.9$, the condition holds.**\n\nThe proposed condition is $-rb  c$. This precisely matches our derivation.\nThe justification, \"because the relatedness-weighted effect on the recipient is $r(-b)$,\" correctly identifies the component of the inclusive fitness calculation that provides the indirect benefit. The full logic is that this indirect benefit, $r(-b) = -rb$, must exceed the direct cost, $c$. The reasoning is sound.\nLet us examine the numerical example: $r=-0.15$, $b=8$, $c=0.9$.\nAccording to the condition $-rb  c$:\n$$ -(-0.15)(8)  0.9 $$\n$$ (0.15)(8)  0.9 $$\n$$ 1.2  0.9 $$\nThis inequality is true. The numerical example is consistent with the correct condition. The values are also biologically plausible for a scenario of spite evolution.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. The act is favored when $r b  c$ if $b0$ is taken to represent harm; for example, with $r=-0.15$, $b=-8$, and $c=0.9$, the condition holds.**\n\nThis option attempts to solve the problem by redefining the given parameters. The problem statement is explicit and unambiguous: \"$b$ denotes the absolute magnitude of the fitness decrement\" and \"$b0$\". This option proposes instead that \"if $b0$ is taken to represent harm.\" A solution cannot be based on violating the premises of the problem. Such an approach demonstrates a failure to adhere to the given constraints.\nEven if we were to entertain this flawed redefinition, the logic would be as follows: Fitness effect on recipient is $b$, where $b0$. The condition for $\\Delta W_{IF} = -c + rb  0$ becomes $rb  c$. With $r=-0.15$ and $b=-8$, we get $(-0.15)(-8) = 1.2$, and $1.2  0.9$, so it is arithmetically consistent under the redefined terms. However, the redefinition itself makes the option invalid.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The act is never favored in inclusive fitness terms because both $b0$ for the recipient and $c0$ for the actor, so the inclusive fitness effect must be negative regardless of $r$; hence, no numerical example can satisfy the condition.**\n\nThis option exhibits a fundamental misunderstanding of inclusive fitness theory. It claims the inclusive fitness effect, $\\Delta W_{IF} = -c + r(-b)$, \"must be negative regardless of $r$.\" This is false.\nThe term $r(-b)$ is the product of two negative numbers, since $r0$ and $-b0$ (as $b0$). The product of two negative numbers is a positive number.\n$$ r(-b) = -rb  0 $$\nTherefore, the inclusive fitness change is the sum of a negative term ($-c$) and a positive term ($-rb$).\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -c - rb $$\nWhether this sum is positive or negative depends on the relative magnitudes of the cost $c$ and the indirect benefit $-rb$. If $|-rb|  |c|$, which is simply $-rb  c$, then $\\Delta W_{IF}$ will be positive. As demonstrated in the analysis of option B, such conditions are possible. The assertion that the act can never be favored is patently false and ignores the entire theoretical basis for the evolution of spite.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2813919"}, {"introduction": "Many social interactions, including parental care, are not unilateral decisions but complex strategic games where each individual's best move depends on the actions of others.

Thus, the first-order condition is sufficient for a unique maximum. Assuming an interior solution where $I_{m}^{\\ast}  0$, the first-order condition (FOC) is found by setting the partial derivative with respect to $I_m$ equal to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U_{m}}{\\partial I_{m}} = r S'(I_{m}+I_{f}) - C_{m}'(I_{m}) = 0$$\nThis equation implicitly defines the male's best-response function, $I_{m}^{\\ast}(I_{f})$.\n\nSimilarly, for the female, her best-response function $I_{f}^{\\ast}(I_{m})$ is implicitly defined by her FOC, assuming $I_{f}^{\\ast}  0$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U_{f}}{\\partial I_{f}} = r S'(I_{m}+I_{f}) - C_{f}'(I_{f}) = 0$$\nA Nash equilibrium $(I_{m}^{\\ast}, I_{f}^{\\ast})$ is a pair of efforts that simultaneously satisfies both first-order conditions.\n\nNext, we derive the comparative static $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}}$, which is the slope of the male's best-response function.

Thus, we have proven $-1  \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}}  0$.\n\nThe biological meaning of this result is that parental efforts are strategic substitutes. The inequality $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}}  0$ means that if the female increases her investment, the male's optimal response is to decrease his. This is a form of free-riding, as the male benefits from the female's increased effort without paying the cost. However, the compensation is only partial, as shown by $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}}  -1$. This means that for every unit of effort the female adds, the male reduces his effort by less than one unit. Consequently, the total investment in care, $I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}$, increases when one parent invests more. To see this, consider the total change in effort as $I_f$ changes: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f})}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{m}^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}I_{f}} + 1  0$. This ensures that total parental care is not undermined by the strategic substitution.\n\nPart 2: Quantitative Solution\n\nWe are given the specific functional forms:\n$$S(x) = 1 - \\exp(-kx), \\quad k0$$\n$$C_{m}(I_{m}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\alpha I_{m}^{2}, \\quad \\alpha0$$\n$$C_{f}(I_{f}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta I_{f}^{2}, \\quad \\beta0$$\nThe derivatives required for the FOCs are:\n$$S'(x) = k \\exp(-kx)$$\n$$C_{m}'(I_{m}) = \\alpha I_{m}$$\n$$C_{f}'(I_{f}) = \\beta I_{f}$$\nSubstituting these into the FOCs from Part 1, we obtain the system of equations for the Nash equilibrium $(I_{m}^{\\ast}, I_{f}^{\\ast})$:\n$$r k \\exp(-k(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}^{\\ast})) - \\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n$$r k \\exp(-k(I_{m}^{\\ast}+I_{f}^{\\ast})) - \\beta I_{f}^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad (2)$$\nFrom these two equations, we see that the left-hand sides are equal for the shared term:\n$$\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = \\beta I_{f}^{\\ast}$$\nThis yields a linear relationship between the optimal efforts:\n$$I_{f}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} I_{m}^{\\ast}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $I_{f}^{\\ast}$ back into equation ($1$):\n$$\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = r k \\exp\\left(-k\\left(I_{m}^{\\ast} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}I_{m}^{\\ast}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = r k \\exp\\left(-k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast} = r k \\exp\\left(-k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{\\beta+\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\\right)$$\nTo solve this transcendental equation for $I_{m}^{\\ast}$, we rearrange it into the form $z \\exp(z) = y$, whose solution is given by the Lambert W function, $z = W(y)$.\n$$\\frac{\\alpha I_{m}^{\\ast}}{r k} = \\exp\\left(-k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\beta}\\right)$$\n$$I_{m}^{\\ast} \\exp\\left(k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{r k}{\\alpha}$$\nLet $z = k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\beta}$.

Substituting this:\n$$\\left(z \\frac{\\beta}{k(\\alpha+\\beta)}\\right) \\exp(z) = \\frac{r k}{\\alpha}$$\n$$z \\exp(z) = \\frac{r k}{\\alpha} \\cdot \\frac{k(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{r k^{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha\\beta}$$\nThe solution for $z$ is:\n$$z = W\\left(\\frac{r k^{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)$$\nSubstituting back $z = k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\beta}$:\n$$k I_{m}^{\\ast} \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\beta} = W\\left(\\frac{r k^{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)$$\n$$I_{m}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta}{k(\\alpha+\\beta)} W\\left(\\frac{r k^{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)$$\nNow we find $I_{f}^{\\ast}$ using the relation $I_{f}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} I_{m}^{\\ast}$:\n$$I_{f}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\left[ \\frac{\\beta}{k(\\alpha+\\beta)} W\\left(\\frac{r k^{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha\\beta}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$I_{f}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{k(\\alpha+\\beta)} W\\left(\\frac{r k^{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)$$\nSince all parameters $r, k, \\alpha, \\beta$ are positive, the argument of the Lambert W function is positive. For a positive argument $x0$, $W(x)0$. Thus, $I_m^{\\ast}$ and $I_f^{\\ast}$ are positive, confirming our assumption of an interior solution.\n\nThe final equilibrium pair is $(I_{m}^{\\ast}, I_{f}^{\\ast})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{k(\\alpha+\\beta)} W\\left(\\frac{r k^{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)  \\frac{\\alpha}{k(\\alpha+\\beta)} W\\left(\\frac{r k^{2}(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2814003"}]}
