It is a standard exercise in mathematical biology that tests the understanding of equilibrium binding, mass conservation, and cooperative signaling. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Fractional Receptor Occupancy, $\\theta$**\n\nWe are given the equilibrium relationship and the conservation of total receptors:\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\n$$R_{T} = [R] + [RL]$$\nThe objective is to find an expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$.\n\nFrom the receptor conservation equation, we express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, in terms of the total concentration, $R_{T}$, and the concentration of bound receptors, $[RL]$:\n$$[R] = R_{T} - [RL]$$\nSubstitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the dissociation constant $K_{D}$:\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{(R_{T} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nOur goal is to solve for $[RL]$. We rearrange the equation:\n$$K_{D} [RL] = (R_{T} - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_{D} [RL] = R_{T}[L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_{D} [RL] + [RL][L] = R_{T}[L]$$\nFactor out $[RL]$ from the left-hand side:\n$$[RL] (K_{D} + [L]) = R_{T}[L]$$\nIsolate $[RL]$:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{R_{T}[L]}{K_{D} + [L]}$$\nNow, we can compute the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ by dividing by the total receptor concentration $R_{T}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}} = \\frac{1}{R_{T}} \\left( \\frac{R_{T}[L]}{K_{D} + [L]} \\right)$$\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D} + [L]}$$\nThis is the well-known Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding (Hill coefficient of $1$).\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Active Adaptor Fraction, $f_{A}$, and Explanation of Ultrasensitivity**\n\nWe are given the relationships for the downstream signaling module:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[A]}{[X]\\; s^{n}}$$\n$$[X]_{T} = [X] + [A]$$\nWe are also told to identify $s$ with $\\theta$, so $s=\\theta$. The objective is to derive the active fraction $f_{A} = \\frac{[A]}{[X]_{T}}$ as a function of $\\theta$, $n$, and $K_{a}$.\n\nFrom the adaptor conservation equation, we express the concentration of free adaptor $[X]$:\n$$[X] = [X]_{T} - [A]$$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $K_{a}$, replacing $s$ with $\\theta$:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[A]}{([X]_{T} - [A])\\; \\theta^{n}}$$\nNow, we solve for the concentration of active adaptor, $[A]$:\n$$K_{a} ([X]_{T} - [A]) \\theta^{n} = [A]$$\n$$K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n} - K_{a} [A] \\theta^{n} = [A]$$\n$$K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n} = [A] + K_{a} [A] \\theta^{n}$$\nFactor out $[A]$ from the right-hand side:\n$$K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n} = [A] (1 + K_{a} \\theta^{n})$$\nIsolate $[A]$:\n$$[A] = \\frac{K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n}}{1 + K_{a} \\theta^{n}}$$\nFinally, we compute the active fraction $f_{A}$ by dividing by the total adaptor concentration $[X]_{T}$:\n$$f_{A} = \\frac{[A]}{[X]_{T}} = \\frac{1}{[X]_{T}} \\left( \\frac{K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n}}{1 + K_{a} \\theta^{n}} \\right)$$\n$$f_{A} = \\frac{K_{a} \\theta^{n}}{1 + K_{a} \\theta^{n}}$$\nThis is a Hill equation with Hill coefficient $n$, relating the output $f_A$ to the input $\\theta$.\n\nExplanation of ultrasensitivity:\nThe fractional receptor occupancy $\\theta$ is a hyperbolic function of the ligand concentration $[L]$, representing a graded, smooth response. However, the derived expression for the active adaptor fraction, $f_{A}$, has the input $\\theta$ raised to the power of $n$. For $n>1$, this function exhibits a sigmoidal, switch-like behavior. This is known as ultrasensitivity. The response $f_{A}$ is very low for small values of $\\theta$, but it increases sharply over a narrow range of $\\theta$ values. This is because the activation of $X$ requires the cooperative assembly of $n$ ligand-bound receptors. The probability of forming such an $n$-mer complex is proportional to $\\theta^{n}$. If $n$ is large, this term remains close to zero until $\\theta$ approaches a critical threshold, at which point it rises steeply. This non-linear amplification transforms the smooth input signal ($\\theta$) into a sharp, threshold-like output signal ($f_{A}$), allowing the cell to make a more decisive, \"all-or-none\" response to a change in ligand concentration. The steepness of this switch is controlled by the cooperativity parameter $n$.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of Ligand Concentration $[L]_{p}$**\n\nThe objective is to solve for the ligand concentration $[L]_{p}$ that results in a specified active fraction $f_{A} = p$, where $p \\in (0,1)$. This requires a two-step inversion.\n\nFirst, we find the receptor occupancy $\\theta_{p}$ that yields $f_{A} = p$. We set the expression from Part 2 equal to $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}}{1 + K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}}$$\nWe solve for $\\theta_{p}$:\n$$p(1 + K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}) = K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}$$\n$$p + p K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n} = K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}$$\n$$p = K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n} - p K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}$$\n$$p = K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n} (1 - p)$$\n$$\\theta_{p}^{n} = \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)}$$\nTaking the $n$-th root gives $\\theta_{p}$:\n$$\\theta_{p} = \\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}$$\nSecond, we find the ligand concentration $[L]_{p}$ that produces this occupancy $\\theta_{p}$. We use the expression from Part 1, setting $\\theta = \\theta_{p}$ and $[L] = [L]_{p}$:\n$$\\theta_{p} = \\frac{[L]_{p}}{K_{D} + [L]_{p}}$$\nWe solve for $[L]_{p}$:\n$$\\theta_{p} (K_{D} + [L]_{p}) = [L]_{p}$$\n$$\\theta_{p} K_{D} + \\theta_{p} [L]_{p} = [L]_{p}$$\n$$\\theta_{p} K_{D} = [L]_{p} - \\theta_{p} [L]_{p}$$\n$$\\theta_{p} K_{D} = [L]_{p} (1 - \\theta_{p})$$\n$$[L]_{p} = K_{D} \\frac{\\theta_{p}}{1 - \\theta_{p}}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\theta_{p}$ into this equation to obtain the final answer in terms of the given parameters:\n$$[L]_{p} = K_{D} \\frac{\\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}}{1 - \\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}}$$\nThis formula provides the required ligand concentration $[L]_{p}$ to achieve an activation level $p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\nK_{D} \\frac{\\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}}{1 - \\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}}\n}\n$$", "id": "2809547"}, {"introduction": "Once a pathogen is engulfed by a phagocyte, it faces a multi-pronged attack from an arsenal of killing mechanisms. A key challenge for immunologists is to determine the relative importance of each weapon and how they might work together. This practice puts you in the role of an experimentalist, asking you to design a robust strategy to quantitatively dissect the contributions of two major killing pathways: reactive oxygen species and phagosome acidification [@problem_id:2809413]. Solving this requires an understanding of factorial experimental design, a cornerstone of modern biological research.", "problem": "Innate immune phagocytes deploy multiple, partially overlapping mechanisms to kill ingested bacteria, prominently including reactive oxygen species (ROS; chemically reactive oxygen-containing molecules generated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, often abbreviated as NADPH oxidase) and phagosome acidification driven by the vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). A common modeling assumption for parallel lethal processes acting on a well-mixed bacterial population inside phagosomes is that each mechanism contributes an additive hazard (instantaneous killing rate), so that the total hazard experienced by the population is the sum of contributions from each active mechanism. Assume you can measure viable intracellular bacteria over time as colony-forming units (CFU) and convert them to a survival fraction $S(t)$ relative to the initial intracellular CFU at time $t=0$. You may use small-molecule inhibitors with established primary targets and orthogonal readouts to confirm target engagement.\n\nWhich option outlines an experimental and modeling strategy that can disentangle ROS-dependent from acidification-dependent killing and detect any interaction between them in a scientifically sound and identifiable manner?\n\nA. Use $4$ treatment conditions in otherwise identical phagocyte cultures infected at the same multiplicity of infection: untreated control, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor such as diphenyleneiodonium (DPI; inhibits ROS production), a V-ATPase inhibitor such as bafilomycin A1 (blocks phagosome acidification), and the combination of both inhibitors. At multiple post-phagocytosis time points ($t$ spanning a window where net intracellular bacterial replication is negligible), quantify $S(t)$ by CFU, verify on-target effects by measuring the oxidative burst (for example, luminol chemiluminescence) and phagosomal pH (for example, using a pH-sensitive probe such as pHrodo), and fit each $S(t)$ curve to an exponential-kill model with a constant hazard $h$ so that $\\ln S(t)$ versus $t$ is approximately linear. Interpret the fitted hazards across the $4$ conditions as follows: the baseline hazard $k_{0}$ is measured when both pathways are inhibited, the ROS-specific hazard $k_{\\mathrm{ROS}}$ is the excess hazard present when acidification is inhibited, the acidification-specific hazard $k_{\\mathrm{pH}}$ is the excess hazard present when ROS is inhibited, and an interaction term $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is present only when both pathways are active. Test independence by checking whether the control hazard equals $k_{0}+k_{\\mathrm{ROS}}+k_{\\mathrm{pH}}$ within error; a deviation indicates interaction.\n\nB. Treat infected phagocytes with DPI alone and, at a single late time point $t$, compare CFU to untreated controls to estimate the ROS contribution. Attribute any remaining difference between initial CFU and the DPI condition at that time to acidification, without additional inhibitors. Model $S(t)$ using a logistic growth equation constrained to a common carrying capacity across conditions.\n\nC. To isolate acidification effects, add ammonium chloride to the medium to neutralize extracytoplasmic pH and treat cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine to scavenge ROS. Measure bacterial fluorescence intensity at one time point $t$ rather than CFU and fit a Michaelis–Menten curve to fluorescence versus time to infer rate constants for each pathway.\n\nD. Infect wild-type and NADPH oxidase–deficient phagocytes and add a bacteriostatic antibiotic to prevent extracellular growth. Measure CFU at a single intermediate time point $t$ and compute the difference between genotypes to estimate the ROS contribution; assume the remainder is due to acidification. Do not perturb acidification or measure phagosomal pH to avoid complicating factors.\n\nE. Label bacteria with a pH-sensitive dye and load phagocytes with a ROS-sensitive dye, acquire live-cell imaging without inhibitors, and compute the correlation between ROS signal and pH signal across phagosomes. Use this correlation to partition killing between ROS and acidification, assuming higher signal implies higher killing, obviating the need for CFU measurements or time-course modeling.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **System:** Innate immune phagocytes killing ingested bacteria.\n- **Killing Mechanisms:** Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidase, and phagosome acidification driven by V-ATPase.\n- **Modeling Framework:** A common assumption is that parallel lethal processes contribute an additive hazard (instantaneous killing rate), such that the total hazard is the sum of individual hazards.\n- **Observable:** The survival fraction $S(t)$ of intracellular bacteria, determined from colony-forming units (CFU) relative to the initial count at $t=0$.\n- **Experimental Perturbations:** Small-molecule inhibitors with established targets are available.\n- **Experimental Verification:** Orthogonal readouts can confirm target engagement.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The subject matter—phagocytic killing mechanisms—is a cornerstone of immunology. The described components (NADPH oxidase, V-ATPase), inhibitors (DPI, bafilomycin), and measurement techniques (CFU, ROS/pH probes) are standard and factually correct. The additive hazard model is a common and appropriate quantitative framework for survival analysis in this context.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem asks for a strategy to deconvolve the contributions of two processes and their interaction, a clear and solvable objective in systems biology.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is technical and precise, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides a sufficient conceptual basis to evaluate the proposed strategies. The assumption of negligible bacterial replication over the experimental window is a necessary and standard simplification for modeling killing kinetics. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived by analyzing the proposed options.\n\nThe objective is to find a strategy that can rigorously and quantitatively separate the killing contributions of ROS ($k_{\\mathrm{ROS}}$) and acidification ($k_{\\mathrm{pH}}$), measure any baseline killing independent of these two mechanisms ($k_0$), and quantify any interaction between them ($k_{\\mathrm{int}}$). The total hazard, $h$, determines the survival fraction via the equation $S(t) = e^{-ht}$, assuming a constant hazard. This implies that the logarithm of the survival fraction is linear with time: $\\ln S(t) = -ht$. The hazard $h$ can thus be determined from the slope of a plot of $\\ln S(t)$ versus $t$.\n\nA sound strategy must employ a design that allows for the estimation of a full factorial model:\n$h = k_{0} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{ROS}} k_{\\mathrm{ROS}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{pH}} k_{\\mathrm{pH}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{ROS}}\\delta_{\\mathrm{pH}} k_{\\mathrm{int}}$\nwhere $\\delta_{\\mathrm{ROS}}$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{pH}}$ are indicator variables equal to $1$ if the respective pathway is active and $0$ if it is inhibited. This requires measuring the hazard under four conditions:\n1.  Control ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{ROS}}=1$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{pH}}=1$): $h_{\\mathrm{control}} = k_0 + k_{\\mathrm{ROS}} + k_{\\mathrm{pH}} + k_{\\mathrm{int}}$\n2.  ROS inhibited, Acidification active ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{ROS}}=0$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{pH}}=1$): $h_{\\mathrm{DPI}} = k_0 + k_{\\mathrm{pH}}$\n3.  ROS active, Acidification inhibited ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{ROS}}=1$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{pH}}=0$): $h_{\\mathrm{Baf}} = k_0 + k_{\\mathrm{ROS}}$\n4.  Both inhibited ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{ROS}}=0$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{pH}}=0$): $h_{\\mathrm{DPI+Baf}} = k_0$\n\nFrom these four experimentally measured hazards, all four parameters ($k_0$, $k_{\\mathrm{ROS}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{pH}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$) can be uniquely determined:\n- $k_0 = h_{\\mathrm{DPI+Baf}}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{ROS}} = h_{\\mathrm{Baf}} - h_{\\mathrm{DPI+Baf}}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{pH}} = h_{\\mathrm{DPI}} - h_{\\mathrm{DPI+Baf}}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{int}} = h_{\\mathrm{control}} - (k_0 + k_{\\mathrm{ROS}} + k_{\\mathrm{pH}}) = h_{\\mathrm{control}} - h_{\\mathrm{Baf}} - h_{\\mathrm{DPI}} + h_{\\mathrm{DPI+Baf}}$\n\nAn interaction exists if $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is statistically significantly different from zero.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Use $4$ treatment conditions...**\nThis option proposes a complete $2 \\times 2$ factorial experimental design using untreated cells, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor (DPI), a V-ATPase inhibitor (bafilomycin A1), and the combination of both.\n- **Experimental Design:** This is the correct design to probe two factors and their interaction. It directly maps to the four conditions required to solve for the four parameters of the model.\n- **Measurements:** It correctly specifies measuring the survival fraction $S(t)$ via CFU counts at multiple time points, which is essential for determining the rate (hazard, $h$) by fitting $\\ln S(t)$ vs. $t$. It also laudably includes verification of on-target inhibitor effects using orthogonal readouts for ROS and pH, which is a requirement for rigorous science.\n- **Modeling and Interpretation:** The strategy correctly proposes fitting an exponential-kill model to obtain the hazard $h$ for each condition. The interpretation of the hazards to find the baseline ($k_{0}$), specific ($k_{\\mathrm{ROS}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{pH}}$), and interaction ($k_{\\mathrm{int}}$) terms is logically sound and follows the framework outlined above. The test for independence (i.e., no interaction) by checking if the control hazard equals the sum of the components is correct.\nThis option describes a complete, rigorous, and logically coherent strategy. **Correct.**\n\n**B. Treat infected phagocytes with DPI alone...**\nThis option proposes an incomplete experiment. It uses only two conditions (control and DPI) and measures CFU at a single late time point.\n- **Experimental Design:** An incomplete factorial design. It lacks the conditions with acidification inhibited (bafilomycin A1) and both pathways inhibited. Without these, it is impossible to isolate the effect of acidification from the baseline or to test for an interaction.\n- **Measurements:** A single time point measurement is insufficient. It provides a measure of cumulative death, not a rate of death (hazard). The dynamics of the process are lost.\n- **Modeling:** Suggesting a logistic growth model is inappropriate given the problem statement that net replication is negligible, for which a pure-kill model is more suitable.\nThis strategy is fundamentally flawed and inadequate for the stated goal. **Incorrect.**\n\n**C. To isolate acidification effects, add ammonium chloride...**\nThis option proposes alternative inhibitors and a different measurement technique.\n- **Experimental Design:** While using ammonium chloride and N-acetylcysteine to modulate pH and ROS is a plausible alternative, the overall strategy is poor. It is not specified if a full factorial design is used.\n- **Measurements:** The use of bacterial fluorescence intensity as a proxy for viability is a critical error. A dead bacterium may still be fluorescent. CFU is the gold standard for viability, and deviating from it requires extensive validation not mentioned here. Again, measurement at a single time point precludes the calculation of a rate.\n- **Modeling:** Proposing to fit a Michaelis-Menten curve is nonsensical. Michaelis-Menten kinetics describe enzyme rates as a function of substrate concentration, which has no logical connection to a time-course of bacterial survival.\nThis strategy is based on faulty measurement principles and an irrelevant mathematical model. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Infect wild-type and NADPH oxidase–deficient phagocytes...**\nThis option uses a genetic approach instead of a pharmacological one.\n- **Experimental Design:** Using a genetic knockout of NADPH oxidase is an elegant way to ablate ROS production. However, the design is still an incomplete factorial experiment, equivalent to option B. It compares a system with both pathways active (wild-type) to a system with only acidification active (knockout). It does not perturb the acidification pathway, making it impossible to measure the baseline killing rate or test for interaction.\n- **Measurements:** The reliance on a single time point measurement is a recurring and fatal flaw, as it does not allow for rate determination.\n- **Scientific Rationale:** Explicitly stating to \"not perturb acidification or measure phagosomal pH to avoid complicating factors\" is the opposite of good scientific practice. Proper experimental design requires controlling and measuring all relevant variables.\nThis strategy is an incomplete design and promotes poor scientific methodology. **Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Label bacteria with a pH-sensitive dye and load phagocytes with a ROS-sensitive dye...**\nThis option proposes a purely observational strategy based on live-cell imaging.\n- **Experimental Design:** This is not an experimental manipulation designed to test causality. It is purely correlational. No inhibitors are used, so no effects can be isolated.\n- **Measurements and Interpretation:** The core assumption that \"higher signal implies higher killing\" is unsubstantiated and likely false. The relationship between the concentration of a killing agent and its bactericidal efficacy is complex and non-linear. Furthermore, a correlation between ROS and pH signals does not quantify their respective contributions to the killing outcome.\n- **Omission of Viability:** The explicit decision to obviate CFU measurements is a critical error. A strategy to study killing must, by definition, measure viability.\nThis approach confuses correlation with causation and fails to measure the primary outcome of interest (bacterial death). **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly option A presents a scientifically rigorous, comprehensive, and quantitative strategy that is capable of achieving the stated objectives. It correctly combines a full factorial experimental design with appropriate time-course measurements, a suitable mathematical model, and necessary verification steps.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2809413"}, {"introduction": "Mounting an effective immune defense comes at a significant physiological price, diverting resources from other essential functions like growth and reproduction.

Each incorporation consumes one NTP, which is counted as $1$ ATP equivalent. The cost is therefore $1 \\cdot L_{\\text{nt}} = L_{\\text{nt}}$.\n$2$. $5^{\\prime}$ Capping: Each mRNA molecule is modified with a $5^{\\prime}$ cap, a process that consumes one GTP molecule, counted as $1$ ATP equivalent.\n$3$. Polyadenylation: A poly(A) tail of length $A$ is added to the $3^{\\prime}$ end. This involves the polymerization of $A$ adenosine monophosphates from $A$ ATP molecules, costing $A$ ATP equivalents.\nSumming these components, the total ATP cost per mRNA molecule is:\n$$E_{\\text{mRNA}} = L_{\\text{nt}} + 1 + A$$\n\nNext, we derive the energy cost to synthesize a single protein molecule, which we denote as $E_{\\text{protein}}$. The protein has a length of $L_{\\text{aa}}$ amino acids. The problem specifies two major costs:\n$1$. Aminoacyl-tRNA Charging: Before an amino acid can be incorporated into a polypeptide, it must be attached to its corresponding tRNA. This activation step consumes one ATP, which is hydrolyzed to AMP and pyrophosphate, a reaction counted as $2$ ATP equivalents. For a protein of $L_{\\text{aa}}$ amino acids, this must be done for each amino acid. The total charging cost is $2 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}$.\n$2$. Translation Elongation: The problem states that the incorporation of each amino acid during elongation consumes two GTP molecules, counted as $2$ ATP equivalents per amino acid. For a protein of $L_{\\text{aa}}$ amino acids, the total elongation cost is $2 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}$.\nSumming these two components, the total ATP cost per protein molecule is:\n$$E_{\\text{protein}} = (2 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}) + (2 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}) = 4 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the total energy expenditure per cell, $E_{\\text{total}}$, by scaling these single-molecule costs to the entire ISG program. The program consists of $N_{\\text{ISG}}$ genes, each induced to a steady-state level of $c$ mRNA copies.\nThe total number of mRNA molecules synthesized, $N_{\\text{mRNA\\_total}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{mRNA\\_total}} = N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c$$\nThe total cost of transcription for the entire program, $E_{\\text{transcription\\_total}}$, is the product of the number of mRNA molecules and the cost per molecule:\n$$E_{\\text{transcription\\_total}} = N_{\\text{mRNA\\_total}} \\cdot E_{\\text{mRNA}} = (N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c) \\cdot (L_{\\text{nt}} + A + 1)$$\n\nEach of these mRNA molecules is translated an average of $r$ times. Therefore, the total number of protein molecules synthesized, $N_{\\text{protein\\_total}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{protein\\_total}} = N_{\\text{mRNA\\_total}} \\cdot r = N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot r$$\nThe total cost of translation for the entire program, $E_{\\text{translation\\_total}}$, is the product of the number of protein molecules and the cost per molecule:\n$$E_{\\text{translation\\_total}} = N_{\\text{protein\\_total}} \\cdot E_{\\text{protein}} = (N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot r) \\cdot (4 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}})$$\n\nThe total ATP expenditure per cell is the sum of the total transcription and translation costs:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{transcription\\_total}} + E_{\\text{translation\\_total}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot (L_{\\text{nt}} + A + 1)) + (N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot r \\cdot 4 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}})$$\nFactoring out the common term $N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c$, we arrive at the general expression for the total ATP equivalents expended per cell:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot [(L_{\\text{nt}} + A + 1) + 4 \\cdot r \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}]$$\n\nThis expression completes the first part of the task. For the second part, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $N_{\\text{ISG}} = 150$\n- $c = 40$\n- $L_{\\text{nt}} = 1500$\n- $A = 200$\n- $L_{\\text{aa}} = 400$\n- $r = 300$\n\nWe calculate the terms within the brackets first.\nThe transcription-related cost per gene copy:\n$$L_{\\text{nt}} + A + 1 = 1500 + 200 + 1 = 1701$$\nThe translation-related cost per gene copy:\n$$4 \\cdot r \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}} = 4 \\cdot 300 \\cdot 400 = 1200 \\cdot 400 = 480000$$\nThe total cost per gene copy is the sum:\n$$1701 + 480000 = 481701$$\nNow, we multiply by the number of copies per gene, $c$, and the number of genes, $N_{\\text{ISG}}$:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (150 \\cdot 40) \\cdot 481701$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 6000 \\cdot 481701$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 2890206000$$\nThis is the total number of ATP equivalents expended per cell. The problem requires the answer to be expressed in scientific notation rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 2.890206 \\times 10^9 \\approx 2.89 \\times 10^9$$\nThis is the final numerical answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.89 \\times 10^{9}}$$", "id": "2809560"}]}
