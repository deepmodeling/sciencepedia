The mathematical formulation, including the diffusive approximation for early-time voltage spread, is a legitimate and recognized simplification.

We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$ R \\, dR = \\frac{a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k} r \\exp(-\\alpha r) dr $$\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n$$ \\int R \\, dR = \\int \\frac{a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k} r \\exp(-\\alpha r) dr $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}R(r)^2 = \\frac{a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k} \\int r \\exp(-\\alpha r) dr $$\nThe integral on the right-hand side is solved using integration by parts, $\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du$. Let $u=r$ and $dv = \\exp(-\\alpha r)dr$. Then $du=dr$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha r)$.\n$$ \\int r \\exp(-\\alpha r) dr = r \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha r)\\right) - \\int \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha r)\\right) dr $$\n$$ = -\\frac{r}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha r) + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\int \\exp(-\\alpha r) dr $$\n$$ = -\\frac{r}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha r) - \\frac{1}{\\alpha^{2}}\\exp(-\\alpha r) = -\\frac{\\exp(-\\alpha r)}{\\alpha^2}(1+\\alpha r) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for $R(r)^2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}R(r)^2 = \\frac{a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k} \\left[ -\\frac{\\exp(-\\alpha r)}{\\alpha^2}(1+\\alpha r) \\right] + C' $$\nwhere $C'$ is the constant of integration.\n$$ R(r)^2 = -\\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2}(1+\\alpha r)\\exp(-\\alpha r) + C $$\nWe use the boundary condition $R(0)=0$ to determine the constant $C = 2C'$.\n$$ R(0)^2 = 0 = -\\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2}(1+0)\\exp(0) + C $$\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2} + C \\implies C = \\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2} $$\nSubstituting $C$ back, we obtain the expression for $R(r)^2$:\n$$ R(r)^2 = \\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2} - \\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2}(1+\\alpha r)\\exp(-\\alpha r) $$\n$$ R(r)^2 = \\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2} \\left[ 1 - (1+\\alpha r)\\exp(-\\alpha r) \\right] $$\nTaking the positive square root for the radial distance gives the mapping function $R(r)$:\n$$ R(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2} \\left[ 1 - (1+\\alpha r)\\exp(-\\alpha r) \\right]} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\rho_{0} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}$, $\\alpha = 0.20$, $k = 50$, $a_{c} = 0.050$.\nFirst, we compute the constant pre-factor:\n$$ \\frac{2 a_{c}\\rho_{0}}{k \\alpha^2} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.050 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{4})}{50 \\times (0.20)^2} = \\frac{3000}{50 \\times 0.04} = \\frac{3000}{2} = 1500\\ \\text{mm}^2 $$\nSo, the mapping equation is:\n$$ R(r) = \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - (1+0.20 r)\\exp(-0.20 r) \\right]}\\ \\text{mm} $$\nWe need to calculate $R(r_{1})$ for $r_{1}=2.0\\ \\text{deg}$ and $R(r_{2})$ for $r_{2}=10.0\\ \\text{deg}$.\n\nFor $r_{1} = 2.0$:\n$$ \\alpha r_{1} = 0.20 \\times 2.0 = 0.40 $$\n$$ R(2.0) = \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - (1+0.40)\\exp(-0.40) \\right]} = \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - 1.4 \\exp(-0.40) \\right]} $$\n$$ R(2.0) \\approx \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - 1.4 \\times 0.670320 \\right]} = \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - 0.938448 \\right]} $$\n$$ R(2.0) \\approx \\sqrt{1500 \\times 0.061552} = \\sqrt{92.328} \\approx 9.6087\\ \\text{mm} $$\n\nFor $r_{2} = 10.0$:\n$$ \\alpha r_{2} = 0.20 \\times 10.0 = 2.0 $$\n$$ R(10.0) = \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - (1+2.0)\\exp(-2.0) \\right]} = \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - 3.0 \\exp(-2.0) \\right]} $$\n$$ R(10.0) \\approx \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - 3.0 \\times 0.135335 \\right]} = \\sqrt{1500 \\left[ 1 - 0.406005 \\right]} $$\n$$ R(10.0) \\approx \\sqrt{1500 \\times 0.593995} = \\sqrt{890.9925} \\approx 29.8495\\ \\text{mm} $$\n\nThe cortical distance $\\Delta R$ is the difference $R(r_{2}) - R(r_{1})$:\n$$ \\Delta R = R(10.0) - R(2.0) \\approx 29.8495 - 9.6087 = 20.2408\\ \\text{mm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $20.24\\ \\text{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20.24}$$", "id": "2784143"}]}
