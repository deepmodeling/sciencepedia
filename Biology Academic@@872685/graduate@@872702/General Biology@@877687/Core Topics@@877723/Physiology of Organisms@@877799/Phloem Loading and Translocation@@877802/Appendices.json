It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics and physical chemistry, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete set of assumptions and definitions necessary to derive a unique, meaningful solution based on the Münch pressure-flow hypothesis for phloem transport. No scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction is found. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. Part A requires the derivation of the axial pressure gradient, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x}$, for viscous flow in a tube. Part B uses this result to find the minimum sucrose concentration difference, $\\Delta C_s$, required to drive this flow osmotically.\n\nPart A: Derivation of the Axial Pressure Gradient\n\nWe begin with the momentum conservation equation for a viscous, incompressible Newtonian fluid in cylindrical coordinates. The problem states to assume steady, axisymmetric, fully developed flow with negligible inertia (low Reynolds number). Let $u(r')$ be the axial velocity at a radial position $r'$, where $0 \\leq r' \\leq r$, and $r$ is the lumen radius. The axial component of the Navier-Stokes equation under these simplifying assumptions reduces to the Stokes flow equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\eta}{r'} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r'} \\left( r' \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}r'} \\right) $$\nHere, $P(x)$ is the hydrostatic pressure, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity. Since $u$ depends only on $r'$ and $P$ depends only on $x$, we use total derivatives. The term $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is constant for a fully developed flow in a uniform tube.\n\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to the radial coordinate $r'$ to find the velocity profile $u(r')$.\nFirst integration:\n$$ \\int r' \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\, \\mathrm{d}r' = \\int \\eta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r'} \\left( r' \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}r'} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}r' $$\n$$ \\frac{r'^2}{2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\eta r' \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}r'} + C_1 $$\nBy axisymmetry, the velocity gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}r'}$ must be zero at the centerline ($r'=0$) to ensure the velocity profile is smooth. This implies that the integration constant $C_1 = 0$.\nRearranging for the velocity gradient:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}r'} = \\frac{r'}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\nSecond integration:\n$$ \\int \\mathrm{d}u = \\int \\frac{r'}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\, \\mathrm{d}r' $$\n$$ u(r') = \\frac{r'^2}{4\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} + C_2 $$\nThe constant $C_2$ is determined by the no-slip boundary condition at the wall, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at $r' = r$.\n$$ u(r) = 0 = \\frac{r^2}{4\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{r^2}{4\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the expression for $u(r')$, we obtain the parabolic velocity profile characteristic of Poiseuille flow:\n$$ u(r') = \\frac{1}{4\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} (r'^2 - r^2) = -\\frac{1}{4\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} (r^2 - r'^2) $$\nFor flow to occur in the positive $x$ direction, the pressure must decrease, meaning $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} < 0$. This gives a positive velocity $u(r')$.\n\nThe total volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is found by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the tube:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{r} u(r') \\, 2\\pi r' \\, \\mathrm{d}r' $$\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{r} \\left(-\\frac{1}{4\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} (r^2 - r'^2)\\right) 2\\pi r' \\, \\mathrm{d}r' $$\nWe can factor out the constants:\n$$ Q = -\\frac{2\\pi}{4\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\int_{0}^{r} (r^2 r' - r'^3) \\, \\mathrm{d}r' $$\n$$ Q = -\\frac{\\pi}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left[ \\frac{r^2 r'^2}{2} - \\frac{r'^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{r} $$\n$$ Q = -\\frac{\\pi}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis yields the Hagen-Poiseuille equation relating flow rate to the pressure gradient:\n$$ Q = -\\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\nSolving for the axial pressure gradient, we find the result for Part A:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} = -\\frac{8 \\eta Q}{\\pi r^4} $$\n\nPart B: Derivation of the Sucrose Concentration Difference\n\nThe result from Part A shows that the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is constant along the axial length $L$ of the sieve tube. The total hydrostatic pressure drop along the tube, $\\Delta P$, from the source (at $x=0$) to the sink (at $x=L$), is given by the integral of the pressure gradient. Let $\\Delta P = P(0) - P(L)$. Flow occurs from high to low pressure, so $\\Delta P$ is a positive quantity.\n$$ P(L) - P(0) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x} L $$\nTherefore, $\\Delta P = -(P(L) - P(0)) = -L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x}$.\nSubstituting our expression for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}x}$:\n$$ \\Delta P = -L \\left(-\\frac{8 \\eta Q}{\\pi r^4}\\right) = \\frac{8 \\eta Q L}{\\pi r^4} $$\nAccording to the problem statement, this hydrodynamic pressure drop is created by an osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\pi$, between the source and the sink. The problem specifies that other resistances are negligible, so we can set the hydrostatic pressure drop equal to the osmotic pressure difference:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\Delta \\pi $$\nThe problem also provides the van 't Hoff equation for the osmotic pressure difference generated by the sucrose concentration difference, $\\Delta C_s$:\n$$ \\Delta \\pi = R T \\Delta C_s $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nBy equating the expressions for the hydrodynamic pressure drop and the osmotic pressure difference, we have:\n$$ \\frac{8 \\eta Q L}{\\pi r^4} = R T \\Delta C_s $$\nFinally, we solve for the minimum required sucrose concentration difference, $\\Delta C_s$:\n$$ \\Delta C_s = \\frac{8 \\eta Q L}{\\pi r^4 R T} $$\nThis expression represents the minimum concentration difference needed to sustain the volumetric flow rate $Q$ through the sieve tube of length $L$ and radius $r$, according to the Münch pressure-flow model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8 \\eta Q L}{\\pi r^{4} R T}}$$", "id": "2822623"}, {"introduction": "The pressure-flow model is driven by a high concentration of sucrose at the source, but how do plant cells achieve this energetically demanding state?

This is a problem in chemical thermodynamics applied to a biological transport process.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the process. The problem describes the cotransport of one proton ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) and one molecule of sucrose ($S$) from the apoplast (outside, subscript $o$) into the sieve element (inside, subscript $i$). The stoichiometry is given as $1\\ \\mathrm{H}^{+}:1\\ \\mathrm{sucrose}$. The net reaction for this coupled transport is:\n$$ \\mathrm{S}_{o} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}_{o} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{S}_{i} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}_{i} $$\nThe total change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_{total}$, for transporting one mole of each species across the membrane is the sum of the changes in their respective electrochemical potentials ($\\tilde{\\mu}$).\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} + \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\tilde{\\mu}_{j,i} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{j,o}$ represents the change in electrochemical potential for species $j$ moving from outside to inside.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum $\\Delta p$ required to maintain the concentration gradient. This minimum condition corresponds to the reversible limit, or thermodynamic equilibrium, where the net flux is zero. At equilibrium, the total change in Gibbs free energy for the process is zero.\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = 0 $$\nTherefore, the equilibrium condition is:\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} + \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = -\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} $$\nThis equation shows that at equilibrium, the energy released by the favorable movement of protons down their electrochemical gradient exactly balances the energy required to move sucrose against its concentration gradient.\n\nNext, we must express each term. The electrochemical potential for a species $j$ is given by $\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^{\\circ} + RT\\ln(C_j) + z_j F \\psi$, where $\\mu_j^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $C_j$ is the molar concentration, $z_j$ is the charge number, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the electrical potential.\n\nFor sucrose ($S$), which is an uncharged molecule, its charge $z_{S}$ is $0$. Therefore, its electrochemical potential is simply its chemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} = \\mu_{S}$. The change in chemical potential for sucrose moving from outside to inside is:\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} = \\mu_{S,i} - \\mu_{S,o} = (\\mu_{S}^{\\circ} + RT\\ln C_{SE}) - (\\mu_{S}^{\\circ} + RT\\ln C_{apo}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{SE}}{C_{apo}}\\right) $$\nHere, we use the given notation $C_{SE}$ for the inside concentration and $C_{apo}$ for the outside concentration.\n\nFor the proton ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$), its charge $z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is $+1$.

It states that the available work per mole of protons moving from outside to inside is $F\\Delta p$. Work made available by a process is the negative of the change in Gibbs free energy of that process. The process is the movement of one mole of protons from $o$ to $i$, for which the Gibbs free energy change is $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},i} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},o}$.\nThus, the available work is $-\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$.\n$$ F\\Delta p = -\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = -F\\Delta p $$\nThis definition means that when proton movement from outside to inside is energetically favorable ($\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} < 0$), the value of $\\Delta p$ is positive, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S}$ and $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ into the equilibrium equation $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = -\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{S}$:\n$$ -F\\Delta p = - \\left( RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{SE}}{C_{apo}}\\right) \\right) $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ gives:\n$$ F\\Delta p = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{SE}}{C_{apo}}\\right) $$\nFinally, we solve for $\\Delta p$ by dividing by the Faraday constant, $F$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{SE}}{C_{apo}}\\right) $$\nThis expression gives the minimum proton motive force, in volts, required to achieve the specified sucrose concentration ratio $C_{SE}/C_{apo}$ at the reversible limit. To actively accumulate sucrose (i.e., for $C_{SE} > C_{apo}$), the logarithm is positive, requiring a positive $\\Delta p$, which corresponds to an inwardly directed electrochemical driving force for protons.

The role of the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase, SUT symporters, and the generation of turgor pressure are all core, accepted concepts in plant physiology.

The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for the prediction of a sequence of events following a specific and well-defined perturbation. The initial state is defined (active phloem loading), the perturbation is defined (inhibition of $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase), and the variables to be tracked are specified. Based on the provided physical and biological principles, a unique and logical sequence of consequences can be derived.

It is free of ambiguity, subjective claims, or opinion.\n\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information and foundational principles required to deduce the answer. No critical information is missing.\n\n5.  **No Other Flaws**: The problem is not trivial, metaphorical, or outside the scope of scientific verification.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a standard, textbook-level question in plant physiology that tests the understanding of coupled transport processes in phloem loading. I will now proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe analysis must proceed from the primary effect of the inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate.\n\n1.  **Primary Event: Inhibition of the $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$-ATPase**. Sodium orthovanadate inhibits the P-type plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$-ATPase in companion cells. This pump's function is to actively extrude protons ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) from the cytosol into the apoplast. The immediate consequence is the cessation of this active $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ pumping.\n\n2.  **Immediate Effects (seconds to a few minutes)**:\n    *   **Apoplastic pH**: The primary flux of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ into the apoplast is halted. Protons continue to be removed from the apoplast via co-transport with sucrose (by SUTs) and by diffusion away from the site. This imbalance leads to a rapid decrease in the apoplastic $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, which corresponds to an **increase in apoplastic pH** (alkalinization).\n    *   **Companion Cell Membrane Potential ($\\Delta \\psi$)**: The $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$-ATPase is an electrogenic pump, moving net positive charge out of the cell. This action creates a large negative membrane potential inside the cell (e.g., $-120\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-150\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). When the pump is inhibited, this outward current of positive charge stops. The membrane potential will rapidly decay towards the diffusion potential, which is much less negative. This is a **depolarization** of the membrane (i.e., $\\Delta \\psi$ becomes less negative, moving closer to $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$).\n    *   **Net Sucrose Uptake**: Sucrose uptake into the SE-CC complex is powered by the proton motive force (PMF), which is the sum of the chemical potential gradient of protons ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$) and the electrical potential gradient ($\\Delta \\psi$). Both of these components are collapsing: the pH gradient is decreasing (apoplast becoming less acidic), and the membrane potential is depolarizing. The driving force for the SUT $\\mathrm{H}^{+}/$sucrose symporters is thus drastically reduced. Consequently, the **net sucrose uptake will sharply decrease**.\n    *   **Sieve Element Turgor Pressure ($\\Psi_p$)**: Turgor pressure is generated by the osmotic influx of water following solute (sucrose) accumulation. This process has capacitance. At the moment of inhibition, the sieve elements already contain a high concentration of sucrose. While further loading ceases, the existing sucrose concentration will maintain a low (negative) osmotic potential ($\\Psi_s$) and thus high turgor pressure ($\\Psi_p$) for a short period. Bulk flow continues to move this sucrose away, but the immediate effect on turgor is negligible. Therefore, sieve element turgor will **remain approximately unchanged initially**.\n\n3.  **Longer-Term Effects (tens of minutes to hours)**:\n    *   **Apoplastic pH and Membrane Potential**: With the $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$-ATPase remaining inhibited, the cell cannot re-establish the proton gradient or the negative membrane potential. The apoplastic pH will **remain elevated** and the membrane will **remain depolarized** relative to the pre-inhibition state.\n    *   **Net Sucrose Uptake**: As the PMF remains collapsed, sucrose loading via SUTs will **remain suppressed** at a very low level.\n    *   **Sieve Element Turgor Pressure ($\\Psi_p$)**: Over this longer timescale, the lack of new sucrose loading becomes dominant. The sucrose already in the source-leaf sieve elements is translocated away to sink tissues. Since it is not being replaced, the solute concentration in the source sieve elements drops. This causes the osmotic potential ($\\Psi_s$) to become less negative (increase). The reduced osmotic gradient for water entry from the xylem leads to a **decrease in sieve element turgor pressure ($\\Psi_p$)**. According to the pressure-flow hypothesis, the rate of bulk flow is proportional to the pressure gradient between source and sink; thus, a decrease in source turgor will **slow or stop bulk flow**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. Immediate: apoplastic pH increases (alkalinization); membrane depolarizes (less negative $\\Delta \\psi$); net sucrose uptake sharply decreases; sieve element turgor remains approximately unchanged initially. Longer-term: apoplastic pH remains elevated relative to control; membrane potential collapses further toward $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$; sucrose uptake remains suppressed; sieve element turgor decreases, slowing bulk flow.**\n    This option perfectly matches the derived sequence of events for both immediate and longer-term effects. Every prediction is consistent with the established principles of phloem loading.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Immediate: apoplastic pH decreases (acidification); membrane hyperpolarizes (more negative $\\Delta \\psi$); net sucrose uptake increases; sieve element turgor increases rapidly. Longer-term: sustained enhancement of all four processes relative to control.**\n    This option describes the effects of stimulating the $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$-ATPase, not inhibiting it. Every prediction is the opposite of the correct outcome.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Immediate: apoplastic pH increases; membrane depolarizes; net sucrose uptake transiently increases due to reduced competition for carriers; sieve element turgor increases transiently. Longer-term: all variables return to baseline as secondary transport compensates for the inhibited pump.**\n    The prediction of a transient increase in sucrose uptake is baseless; the driving force is collapsing, which is the limiting factor, not carrier availability. The long-term prediction of a return to baseline is also incorrect, as there is no specified mechanism that could fully compensate for the primary energy source for loading.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Immediate: apoplastic pH and membrane potential show little or no change due to buffering and channel compensation; net sucrose uptake slowly decreases; sieve element turgor increases as sucrose accumulates in the phloem sap. Longer-term: apoplastic pH decreases below control and membrane hyperpolarizes as $\\mathrm{K}^+$ channels sustain charge separation.**\n    The primary electrogenic pump of the cell membrane is a major determinant of membrane potential and local pH. Its inhibition will cause a rapid, not negligible, change. The long-term predictions are physiologically backward; inhibition of an acid-extruding pump cannot lead to acidification.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Immediate: apoplastic pH increases; membrane depolarizes; net sucrose uptake decreases; sieve element turgor decreases promptly. Longer-term: apoplastic pH returns to acidic values via cell wall acidification; membrane potential hyperpolarizes via $\\mathrm{K}^+$ channel activity; sucrose uptake partially recovers; turgor is restored to near-control values.**\n    The immediate effect on turgor is mischaracterized. A \"prompt\" decrease is less plausible than an initial maintenance of pressure, as explained by osmotic capacitance. The long-term predictions about recovery are physiologically unsupported. While other ion fluxes exist, they cannot substitute for the specific function of the $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$-ATPase in energizing sucrose symport.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that presents a scientifically and logically consistent sequence of events is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2822698"}]}
