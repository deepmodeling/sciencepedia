This first exercise grounds your understanding in the core equation derived from Fick's law, which relates the $CO_2$ assimilation rate ($A$) to stomatal conductance ($g_s$) and the $CO_2$ concentration gradient ($C_a - C_i$). By applying this relationship to a realistic scenario [@problem_id:2838878], you will not only solve for the intercellular $CO_2$ concentration but also explore a simple but powerful model of how stomata might regulate this concentration to optimize photosynthetic function.", "problem": "A broadleaf operating under steady-state gas exchange is illuminated and well-watered. Let the net carbon dioxide assimilation rate be $A$ (molar $CO_2$ uptake per unit leaf area per unit time), the stomatal conductance to carbon dioxide be $g_s$ (molar conductance per unit leaf area), the ambient (boundary-layer external) carbon dioxide mole fraction be $C_a$, and the intercellular airspace carbon dioxide mole fraction be $C_i$. Starting from Fick’s first law applied across the stomatal pathway, the diffusive molar flux equals conductance times the driving gradient. Thus, for carbon dioxide across stomata one has the constitutive relation $A = g_s \\left(C_a - C_i\\right)$, where $A$ is in $\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$, $g_s$ is in $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$, and $C_a$ and $C_i$ are in $\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,mol^{-1}}$.

The units are consistent.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is formulated with precise, objective, and scientific terminology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It is a valid problem in quantitative biology. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first objective is to compute the intercellular $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ mole fraction, $C_i$. We begin with the provided constitutive relation for gas exchange:\n$$A = g_s \\left(C_a - C_i\\right)$$\nWe must algebraically rearrange this equation to solve for $C_i$:\n$$\\frac{A}{g_s} = C_a - C_i$$\n$$C_i = C_a - \\frac{A}{g_s}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $A = 15\\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$, $g_s = 0.3\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$, and $C_a = 400\\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$C_i = 400 - \\frac{15}{0.3}$$\nThe ratio is calculated as:\n$$\\frac{15}{0.3} = \\frac{150}{3} = 50$$\nThe units of this ratio are $(\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}) / (\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}) = \\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,mol^{-1}}$, consistent with the units of $C_a$ and $C_i$.\nSubstituting this result back, we find the value of $C_i$:\n$$C_i = 400 - 50 = 350\\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nThe second objective is to compute the tendency variable, $s$. This requires comparing the computed $C_i$ with the reference value, $C_{i,\\mathrm{ref}}$.

According to the problem's definition for the tendency variable $s$, if $C_i > C_{i,\\mathrm{ref}}$, then $s$ must equal $-1$. This indicates that the stomata should tend to close to reduce the intercellular $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentration toward its target value.\nTherefore, $s = -1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be reported as a two-entry row vector $[C_i, s]$.

The molar flux of water vapor from the leaf to the atmosphere, known as the transpiration flux $E$, is driven by a difference in the mole fraction of water vapor and is proportional to the conductance of the pathway. The relationship is given by the conductance form of Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$E = g_{w} \\cdot \\Delta W$$\nwhere $g_{w}$ is the molar conductance to water vapor per unit leaf area, and $\\Delta W$ is the difference in the mole fraction of water vapor between the intercellular airspaces of the leaf ($W_i$) and the bulk atmosphere ($W_a$).\n$$\\Delta W = W_i - W_a$$\nFor an ideal gas mixture, the mole fraction of a component gas (water vapor, subscript $w$) is defined as the ratio of its partial pressure, $p_w$, to the total pressure of the mixture, $P_{\\mathrm{atm}}$.\n$$W = \\frac{p_w}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}}$$\nThe problem states that the air inside the leaf is saturated with water vapor at the leaf temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{leaf}}$. Under the specified isothermal condition, the leaf temperature is equal to the air temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{leaf}} = T_{\\mathrm{air}} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Therefore, the partial pressure of water vapor inside the leaf, $p_{w,i}$, is the saturation vapor pressure at $25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, which we denote as $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C})$.\n$$p_{w,i} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C})$$\nThe mole fraction of water vapor inside the leaf is thus:\n$$W_i = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C})}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}}$$\nThe water vapor content of the ambient air is given in terms of the Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), which is defined as the difference between the saturation vapor pressure at air temperature and the actual vapor pressure of the air, $p_{w,a}$.\n$$\\mathrm{VPD} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{air}}) - p_{w,a}$$\nGiven that $T_{\\mathrm{air}} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, we can solve for $p_{w,a}$:\n$$p_{w,a} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) - \\mathrm{VPD}$$\nThe mole fraction of water vapor in the ambient air is then:\n$$W_a = \\frac{p_{w,a}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) - \\mathrm{VPD}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}}$$\nNow, we can derive the expression for the mole fraction difference, $\\Delta W$:\n$$\\Delta W = W_i - W_a = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C})}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}} - \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) - \\mathrm{VPD}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}}$$\n$$\\Delta W = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) + \\mathrm{VPD}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{VPD}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}}$$\nThis elegant result shows that the mole fraction driving force for transpiration is directly proportional to the VPD and inversely proportional to the total atmospheric pressure.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the primary equation for flux:\n$$E = g_{w} \\frac{\\mathrm{VPD}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$g_{w} = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$\\mathrm{VPD} = 2\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$\n$P_{\\mathrm{atm}} = 101.325\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$E = (0.5\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times \\frac{2\\ \\mathrm{kPa}}{101.325\\ \\mathrm{kPa}}$$\n$$E \\approx 0.5 \\times 0.0197384\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 0.0098692\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{mmol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$.

Stomatal conductance $g_s$ is a monotonically increasing function of mean stomatal aperture, so any process that increases guard cell turgor will increase $g_s$, whereas processes that decrease guard cell turgor will decrease $g_s$. At the level of first principles, two coupled components govern the dominant short-term dynamics: (i) membrane transport that sets ionic content and membrane potential, and (ii) water flux driven by the resulting osmotic gradients. Blue light triggers stomatal opening via phototropin receptors through activation of plasma membrane H$^+$-ATPases, which hyperpolarize the guard cell membrane and favor uptake of $\\mathrm{K}^+$ and anions, increasing osmotic content. Abscisic acid (ABA), elevated external $\\mathrm{CO}_2$, darkness, and increases in Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) promote closure by activating anion efflux and reducing inward cation fluxes, which depolarizes the membrane and drives $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux; the combined loss of anions and $\\mathrm{K}^+$ lowers guard cell osmotic content and turgor. The Slow Anion Channel 1 (SLAC1) is a major S-type anion efflux pathway in guard cells, Open Stomata 1 (OST1) is a protein kinase required to activate anion efflux in ABA and $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ signaling, Guard cell Outward-Rectifying K$^+$ channel (GORK) is the principal $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux channel during closure, and phototropin1/phototropin2 (*phot1 phot2*) are the blue-light receptors required for blue-light-specific activation of the H$^+$-ATPase.\n\nConsider a set of experiments in which $g_s(t)$ is recorded from epidermal peels or intact leaves subjected to a sequence of environmental and hormonal perturbations: a transition from darkness to red light, the addition of a low-intensity blue-light component on top of red light, application of ABA to the apoplast, washout of ABA, a step increase in external $\\mathrm{CO}_2$, an increase in VPD, and finally a return to darkness.

It is a rigorous test of logical deduction from a given set of scientific principles. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Evaluation\nWe will now evaluate each statement by applying the provided principles to the specified genetic background. The core principle for closure is the combined efflux of anions (e.g., via SLAC1) and cations (e.g., via GORK) to reduce guard cell osmotic potential and turgor. The core principle for blue-light-induced opening is the activation of the H$^+$-ATPase by phototropins, which drives ion uptake.\n\n**A. In *slac1*, steady-state $g_s$ under light is elevated relative to wild type due to impaired closure capacity, ABA-induced and darkness-induced decreases in $g_s$ are strongly blunted and slow, but the blue-light-induced increment of $g_s$ on top of red light remains near normal.**\n- **Analysis**: The *slac1* mutant lacks the major anion efflux pathway. According to the problem, anion efflux is a critical step in closure induced by ABA, darkness, and other stimuli.\n    - Impairment of closure means that the stomata will be less responsive to closing signals. Under light, where opening signals are active, this impairment of the opposing closure pathways will shift the steady-state aperture to a more open state. Therefore, `steady-state $g_s$ under light is elevated` is a correct prediction.\n    - Because SLAC1 is the major anion efflux channel, its absence will severely compromise ABA- and darkness-induced closure. The statement `ABA-induced and darkness-induced decreases in $g_s$ are strongly blunted and slow` is correct.\n    - The blue-light-induced opening is mediated by *phot1 phot2* receptors and the H$^+$-ATPase, leading to ion *uptake*. This pathway is distinct from the SLAC1-mediated *efflux* pathway. Therefore, the specific response to blue light should not be primarily affected in a *slac1* mutant. The claim that `the blue-light-induced increment of $g_s$ on top of red light remains near normal` is also correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In *ost1*, both ABA-induced and elevated-$\\mathrm{CO}_2$-induced decreases in $g_s$ are strongly impaired, steady-state $g_s$ in the light is elevated, and blue-light-induced opening on top of red light remains largely intact.**\n- **Analysis**: The *ost1* mutant lacks the protein kinase required to activate anion efflux specifically in response to ABA and $\\mathrm{CO}_2$.\n    - Without OST1, the signaling cascade from ABA and $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ to the anion efflux channels is broken. Therefore, `both ABA-induced and elevated-CO2-induced decreases in $g_s$ are strongly impaired`. This is a direct consequence of the definition of OST1's role.\n    - As in the *slac1* mutant, the impairment of major closure pathways (here, those for ABA and $\\mathrm{CO}_2$) will lead to a higher steady-state stomatal aperture under conditions that promote opening. The prediction that `steady-state $g_s$ in the light is elevated` is correct.\n    - The blue-light opening pathway is independent of the OST1-dependent closure pathway. Therefore, the statement that `blue-light-induced opening on top of red light remains largely intact` is correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. In *gork*, ABA-induced and darkness-induced decreases in $g_s$ are essentially normal because anion channels dominate closure, so steady-state $g_s$ and closure kinetics are comparable to wild type across the protocol.**\n- **Analysis**: The *gork* mutant lacks the principal $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux channel. The problem states that closure is driven by the *combined loss of anions and $\\mathrm{K}^+$*. Removing the principal pathway for $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux must therefore have a significant impact. Anion efflux through channels like SLAC1 causes membrane depolarization, which in turn creates the electrochemical driving force for $\\mathrm{K}^+$ to exit through outward-rectifying channels like GORK. Without GORK, $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux is severely restricted. This will limit the total loss of solutes and thus the extent and rate of turgor reduction. The claim that the decreases in $g_s$ are `essentially normal` directly contradicts this fundamental principle. The premise that `anion channels dominate closure` to the point of making cation efflux irrelevant is a flawed oversimplification.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In *phot1 phot2*, the blue-light-induced increment in $g_s$ on top of red light is abolished, but ABA-induced and elevated-$\\mathrm{CO}_2$-induced decreases in $g_s$ remain largely intact.**\n- **Analysis**: The *phot1 phot2* double mutant lacks the blue-light receptors.\n    - The problem explicitly states that *phot1 phot2* are `required for blue-light-specific activation of the H+-ATPase`. Without these receptors, the stomatal opening response specifically triggered by blue light will be absent. Thus, `the blue-light-induced increment in $g_s$ on top of red light is abolished`. This is correct. (Note: A basal opening in response to red light via photosynthesis is expected to persist, but the specific blue light effect is gone).\n    - The closure pathways responding to ABA and elevated $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ are functionally separate from the blue-light perception pathway. They rely on components like OST1 and SLAC1. Therefore, these closure responses should be unaffected by the loss of phototropins. The statement that they `remain largely intact` is correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**E. In *slac1*, a step increase in external $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ still elicits a robust and rapid decrease in $g_s$ via phototropin signaling, even though ABA-induced closure is impaired.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement contains two fundamental errors.\n    - First, the *slac1* mutant lacks the major anion efflux channel. The problem states that $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ signaling activates anion efflux. Therefore, in a *slac1* mutant, the $\\mathrm{CO}_2$-induced closure response should be strongly impaired, not `robust and rapid`.\n    - Second, it claims this closure occurs `via phototropin signaling`. Phototropin signaling is responsible for light-induced *opening*, not $\\mathrm{CO}_2$-induced *closure*. These are distinct and opposing pathways. This attribution is factually incorrect based on the provided principles.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. In *gork*, ABA-induced decreases in $g_s$ occur with slower kinetics and reduced amplitude because $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux is limited; some residual closure persists due to anion efflux and consequent osmotic water loss.**\n- **Analysis**: This provides a more accurate analysis of the *gork* phenotype than statement C.\n    - In the *gork* mutant, the principal pathway for $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux is eliminated. While anion efflux can still be initiated by an ABA signal, the inability of the major cation, $\\mathrm{K}^+$, to leave the cell will limit the total reduction in osmotic potential. The continued efflux of anions without a counterbalancing charge movement would rapidly hyperpolarize the membrane back towards the anion Nernst potential, which would oppose further anion efflux. Thus, the overall turgor loss will be smaller and slower. The prediction that `decreases in $g_s$ occur with slower kinetics and reduced amplitude` is correct.\n    - The reason provided, `because K+ efflux is limited`, is also correct.\n    - The initial efflux of anions alone will still cause some loss of solute and thus some osmotic water loss, leading to a partial stomatal closure. The claim that `some residual closure persists` is a correct and nuanced observation.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDF}$$", "id": "2838831"}]}
