We will first derive the general condition for a locally favored allele to increase in frequency when rare, and then use the provided empirical values to compute $\\alpha_{\\min}$.\n\nLet us focus on the microhabitat where allele $A$ is locally adapted. The relative viability of individuals carrying allele $A$ is $1+s$, while the viability of individuals with only allele $a$ is $1$. Let $p$ be the frequency of allele $A$. The frequency of allele $a$ is $1-p$.\nThe frequency of allele $A$ after selection, $p^*$, is determined by the ratio of the total fitness of allele $A$ to the mean fitness of the population.

The post-selection frequency is then approximately linear in $p$:\n$$p^* \\approx p(1+s)$$\nFollowing selection, migration occurs. A fraction $m_{\\mathrm{e}}$ of the population is replaced by immigrants from the other microhabitat, where allele $A$ is maladapted and effectively absent (its frequency is $0$).
