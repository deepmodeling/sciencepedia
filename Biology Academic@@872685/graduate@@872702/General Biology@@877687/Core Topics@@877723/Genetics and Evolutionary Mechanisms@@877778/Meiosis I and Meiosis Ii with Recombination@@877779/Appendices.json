It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided data is self-contained and consistent for determining the genetic interference between linked loci. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must establish the total number of progeny, $N_{total}$, from the testcross. This is the sum of all phenotypic classes observed.\nThe provided counts are:\nParental types: $753$ ($ABC$) and $755$ ($abc$). Total parentals = $753 + 755 = 1508$.\nSingle Crossover (SCO) in region $A$-$B$: $120$ ($Abc$) and $132$ ($aBC$).

The recombination fraction is the proportion of progeny resulting from a meiotic crossover event in that interval. It is critical to recognize that double crossover events involve a crossover in *both* intervals.\n\nThe recombination fraction for the interval $A$-$B$, denoted $RF_{A-B}$, is the sum of the frequencies of single crossovers in region $A$-$B$ and double crossovers, as both contribute to the pool of recombinant chromatids for this interval.\n$$RF_{A-B} = \\frac{\\text{Number of } SCO_{A-B} + \\text{Number of } DCO}{N_{total}}$$\n$$RF_{A-B} = \\frac{252 + 28}{2000} = \\frac{280}{2000} = 0.14$$\n\nSimilarly, the recombination fraction for the interval $B$-$C$, denoted $RF_{B-C}$, is the sum of the frequencies of single crossovers in region $B$-$C$ and double crossovers.\n$$RF_{B-C} = \\frac{\\text{Number of } SCO_{B-C} + \\text{Number of } DCO}{N_{total}}$$\n$$RF_{B-C} = \\frac{212 + 28}{2000} = \\frac{240}{2000} = 0.12$$\n\nThe problem then asks for the expected number of double crossover progeny under the null hypothesis of no crossover interference. If crossovers in adjacent intervals are independent events, the expected frequency of double crossovers ($Freq_{DCO, exp}$) is the product of the individual recombination fractions of the two intervals.\n$$Freq_{DCO, exp} = RF_{A-B} \\times RF_{B-C}$$\n$$Freq_{DCO, exp} = 0.14 \\times 0.12 = 0.0168$$\nThe expected number of double crossover progeny, $N_{DCO, exp}$, is this frequency multiplied by the total number of progeny.\n$$N_{DCO, exp} = Freq_{DCO, exp} \\times N_{total}$$\n$$N_{DCO, exp} = 0.0168 \\times 2000 = 33.6$$\n\nNow, we compute the coefficient of coincidence, $C$. This coefficient is foundationally defined as the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossovers to the expected frequency of double crossovers.\nThe observed frequency of double crossovers, $Freq_{DCO, obs}$, is:\n$$Freq_{DCO, obs} = \\frac{N_{DCO, obs}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{28}{2000} = 0.014$$\nThus, the coefficient of coincidence is:\n$$C = \\frac{Freq_{DCO, obs}}{Freq_{DCO, exp}} = \\frac{0.014}{0.0168}$$\nSimplifying this fraction:\n$$C = \\frac{14}{16.8} = \\frac{140}{168} = \\frac{5 \\times 28}{6 \\times 28} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\nFinally, crossover interference, $I$, is defined as the complement of the coefficient of coincidence. It measures the degree to which a crossover in one interval inhibits the formation of a crossover in the adjacent interval.\n$$I = 1 - C$$\n$$I = 1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.16666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $I \\approx 0.1667$.

Use the following foundational facts to construct a mechanistic probability model for meiosis I (first meiotic division) segregation grounded in first principles.\n\n- Homologous recombination creates crossovers (chiasmata) that, together with arm cohesin, establish physical links between homologs. Let the number of crossovers on the focal homolog pair be a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda$, so that the probability of zero crossovers is $\\exp(-\\lambda)$.\n- A bivalent with at least one chiasma produces tension across homolog kinetochores, enabling robust reductional segregation at meiosis I provided centromeric cohesin (the meiotic kleisin Rec8) is protected. Achiasmate homologs (no chiasma) form two univalents that attach independently to the spindle and segregate at meiosis I as a random partition, yielding a probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ that both homologs move to the same pole (meiosis I nondisjunction).\n- Centromeric Rec8 protection at meiosis I requires Shugoshin-mediated recruitment of Protein Phosphatase $2A$ (PP2A), which prevents premature cleavage of centromeric cohesin until meiosis II. In wild type, conditional on at least one chiasma, residual attachment errors still cause a small meiosis I nondisjunction probability $\\epsilon$ for bivalents. In mutants lacking Shugoshin or centromeric Rec8 protection, sister kinetochores fail to co-orient at meiosis I, and homologs behave effectively as univalents even if a crossover occurred; thus the homolog pair partitions randomly at meiosis I with meiosis I nondisjunction probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ regardless of $X$.\n\nTasks:\n- From these principles, derive an expression for the meiosis I nondisjunction probability per homolog pair in wild type, $P_{\\mathrm{WT}}(\\lambda,\\epsilon)$, and in the mutant lacking Shugoshin or centromeric Rec8 protection, $P_{\\mathrm{mut}}(\\lambda)$.\n- Using $\\lambda = 3$ and $\\epsilon = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, compute the fold-increase in meiosis I nondisjunction, defined as $F = \\dfrac{P_{\\mathrm{mut}}(\\lambda)}{P_{\\mathrm{WT}}(\\lambda,\\epsilon)}$.\n\nReport the final result for $F$ as a pure number with no units.

For a bivalent, which has at least one chiasma ($X \\geq 1$), the nondisjunction probability due to residual errors is $P(NDJ | X \\geq 1) = \\epsilon$.\n\nBy the law of total probability, the total probability of nondisjunction in the wild type, $P_{\\mathrm{WT}}(\\lambda, \\epsilon)$, is the sum of the probabilities of nondisjunction over this partition:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{WT}}(\\lambda, \\epsilon) = P(NDJ | X=0) P(X=0) + P(NDJ | X \\geq 1) P(X \\geq 1)$$\nSubstituting the defined probabilities and expressions:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{WT}}(\\lambda, \\epsilon) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda) + \\epsilon \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)\\right)$$\nThis expression can be algebraically rearranged to consolidate terms involving $\\exp(-\\lambda)$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{WT}}(\\lambda, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-\\lambda) - \\epsilon \\exp(-\\lambda) = \\epsilon + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the nondisjunction probability in the mutant lacking centromeric Rec8 protection, $P_{\\mathrm{mut}}(\\lambda)$. The problem states that in this mutant, homolog segregation is random irrespective of the number of crossovers. The probability of nondisjunction is given as a constant value, $\\frac{1}{2}$.

The classifier predicts a window to be a DSB hotspot if it shows co-occurrence of PRDM9 and H3K4me3 peaks.\n\nFirst, we must define the components of the confusion matrix: True Positives ($TP$), False Positives ($FP$), False Negatives ($FN$), and True Negatives ($TN$).\n\n- **Positive Condition**: The window is a DSB hotspot (DSB-positive).\n- **Negative Condition**: The window is not a DSB hotspot (DSB-negative).\n- **Classifier Predicts Positive**: The window has co-occurrence of PRDM9 and H3K4me3 peaks.\n- **Classifier Predicts Negative**: The window lacks co-occurrence of PRDM9 and H3K4me3 peaks.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can categorize the windows:\n- **True Positives ($TP$)**: The classifier predicts positive, and the condition is positive. These are windows with PRDM9 and H3K4me3 co-occurrence that are DSB-positive.\n- **False Positives ($FP$)**: The classifier predicts positive, but the condition is negative.

These are windows *lacking* PRDM9 and H3K4me3 co-occurrence that are DSB-positive.\n- **True Negatives ($TN$)**: The classifier predicts negative, and the condition is negative. These are windows *lacking* PRDM9 and H3K4me3 co-occurrence that are DSB-negative.\n\nNext, we tabulate the initial counts from the given data:\n- $TP_{initial}$: From the co-occurrence group, the count of DSB-positive windows is $510$.\n$$ TP_{initial} = 510 $$\n- $FP_{initial}$: From the co-occurrence group, the count of DSB-negative windows is $90$.\n$$ FP_{initial} = 90 $$\n- $FN_{initial}$: These are DSB-positive windows from all groups *without* co-occurrence.\n  - PRDM9 only: $60$\n  - H3K4me3 only: $120$\n  - Neither: $60$\n$$ FN_{initial} = 60 + 120 + 60 = 240 $$\n- $TN_{initial}$: These are DSB-negative windows from all groups *without* co-occurrence.\n  - PRDM9 only: $140$\n  - H3K4me3 only: $180$\n  - Neither: $6840$\n$$ TN_{initial} = 140 + 180 + 6840 = 7160 $$\n\nThe problem specifies that certain outliers must be excluded from the analysis.
