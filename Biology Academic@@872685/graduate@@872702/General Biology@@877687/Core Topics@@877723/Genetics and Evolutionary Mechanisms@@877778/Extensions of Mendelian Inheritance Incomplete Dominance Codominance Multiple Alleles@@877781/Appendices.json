It presents a standard problem in population genetics based on the Hardy-Weinberg principle for multiple alleles. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or logical flaws. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected frequencies of $9$ ordered genotype classes in the $F_2$ generation, given a large, randomly mating population with no mutation, migration, or selection. This set of conditions defines a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The core principles are Mendelian segregation and the random union of gametes.\n\nLet the frequencies of the alleles $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ in the population's total gamete pool be $p$, $q$, and $r$, respectively, with the constraint $p + q + r = 1$. Due to the assumption of a large, randomly mating population, the allele frequencies are identical in the male (paternal) and female (maternal) gamete pools.\n-   Frequency of $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$ in maternal gametes: $p, q, r$.\n-   Frequency of $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$ in paternal gametes: $p, q, r$.\n\nThe formation of a zygote involves the random union of one maternal gamete and one paternal gamete. Because the union is random, the event of receiving a particular allele from the mother is statistically independent of the event of receiving a particular allele from the father. The frequency of an ordered genotype $A_i|A_j$, where $A_i$ is the maternal allele and $A_j$ is the paternal allele, is the product of the probabilities of these two independent events.\n$$ \\Pr(A_i|A_j) = \\Pr(\\text{maternal allele is } A_i) \\times \\Pr(\\text{paternal allele is } A_j) $$\nThese probabilities are equivalent to the allele frequencies in the respective gamete pools. Thus, these are the expected genotype frequencies for the zygotes of the next generation (let us call this the $F_1$ generation).\n\nTo find the frequencies in the $F_2$ generation, we must first determine the allele frequencies in the gamete pool produced by the $F_1$ generation. The conditions of no selection, mutation, etc., ensure that allele frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next. We can demonstrate this explicitly.\n\nThe frequencies of the six *unordered* genotypes in the $F_1$ generation are:\n-   $\\Pr(A_1A_1) = \\Pr(A_1|A_1) = p \\times p = p^2$\n-   $\\Pr(A_2A_2) = \\Pr(A_2|A_2) = q \\times q = q^2$\n-   $\\Pr(A_3A_3) = \\Pr(A_3|A_3) = r \\times r = r^2$\n-   $\\Pr(A_1A_2) = \\Pr(A_1|A_2) + \\Pr(A_2|A_1) = pq + qp = 2pq$\n-   $\\Pr(A_1A_3) = \\Pr(A_1|A_3) + \\Pr(A_3|A_1) = pr + rp = 2pr$\n-   $\\Pr(A_2A_3) = \\Pr(A_2|A_3) + \\Pr(A_3|A_2) = qr + rq = 2qr$\n\nThe frequency of allele $A_1$ in the gamete pool produced by the $F_1$ generation, denoted $p'$, is calculated from these genotype frequencies according to the principle of Mendelian segregation. Homozygotes $A_1A_1$ produce only $A_1$ gametes, while heterozygotes $A_1A_k$ produce $A_1$ gametes with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$ p' = \\Pr(A_1A_1) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Pr(A_1A_2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Pr(A_1A_3) $$\n$$ p' = p^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(2pq) + \\frac{1}{2}(2pr) = p^2 + pq + pr = p(p+q+r) $$\nSince $p+q+r=1$, we have $p' = p$.\n\nSimilarly, the frequencies of alleles $A_2$ and $A_3$ in the next gamete pool, $q'$ and $r'$, are:\n$$ q' = \\Pr(A_2A_2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Pr(A_1A_2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Pr(A_2A_3) = q^2 + pq + qr = q(q+p+r) = q $$\n$$ r' = \\Pr(A_3A_3) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Pr(A_1A_3) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Pr(A_2A_3) = r^2 + pr + qr = r(r+p+q) = r $$\n\nThe allele frequencies in the gamete pool that forms the $F_2$ generation are identical to the initial frequencies ($p, q, r$). Therefore, the expected frequencies of the ordered genotypes in the $F_2$ generation are determined by the same random union of gametes and will be identical to the frequencies in the $F_1$ generation.\n\nWe now calculate the frequency for each of the $9$ specific ordered genotypes:\n1.  $\\Pr(A_1|A_1) = p \\times p = p^2$\n2.  $\\Pr(A_1|A_2) = p \\times q = pq$\n3.  $\\Pr(A_1|A_3) = p \\times r = pr$\n4.  $\\Pr(A_2|A_1) = q \\times p = qp = pq$\n5.  $\\Pr(A_2|A_2) = q \\times q = q^2$\n6.  $\\Pr(A_2|A_3) = q \\times r = qr$\n7.  $\\Pr(A_3|A_1) = r \\times p = rp = pr$\n8.  $\\Pr(A_3|A_2) = r \\times q = rq = qr$\n9.  $\\Pr(A_3|A_3) = r \\times r = r^2$\n\nThese frequencies are arranged into a single row vector in the specified order:\n$[A_1|A_1, A_1|A_2, A_1|A_3, A_2|A_1, A_2|A_2, A_2|A_3, A_3|A_1, A_3|A_2, A_3|A_3]$\n\nThe corresponding vector of frequencies is:\n$[p^2, pq, pr, pq, q^2, qr, pr, qr, r^2]$\nThis is the final result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\np^2  pq  pr  pq  q^2  qr  pr  qr  r^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2798833"}, {"introduction": "With the principles of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for multiple alleles established, we can now apply them to a classic case in human genetics: the ABO blood group system.

It is a standard application of the Hardy-Weinberg principle to a multi-allelic locus, a fundamental topic in population genetics. The givens are complete, consistent, and scientifically realistic. The problem violates no validation criteria and is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe assumptions provided—a large, randomly mating population with no evolutionarily relevant forces acting upon it—are the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For a locus with multiple alleles, the principle states that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. The equilibrium genotype frequencies can be predicted from the allele frequencies.\n\nUnder the assumption of random mating, the formation of diploid genotypes can be modeled as the random union of gametes from a common gene pool.

Homozygous for allele $A$ (genotype $AA$): The probability of a gamete carrying $A$ uniting with another gamete carrying $A$ is $p_A \\times p_A$. Thus, $f(AA) = p_A^2$.\n2.  Homozygous for allele $B$ (genotype $BB$): By the same logic, $f(BB) = p_B^2$.\n3.  Homozygous for allele $O$ (genotype $OO$): Similarly, $f(OO) = p_O^2$.\n4.  Heterozygous with alleles $A$ and $B$ (genotype $AB$): This can be formed in two ways: an $A$ sperm fertilizing a $B$ egg (frequency $p_A p_B$), or a $B$ sperm fertilizing an $A$ egg (frequency $p_B p_A$). The total frequency is the sum: $f(AB) = p_A p_B + p_B p_A = 2 p_A p_B$.\n5.  Heterozygous with alleles $A$ and $O$ (genotype $AO$): Formed from an $A$ gamete and an $O$ gamete.

The locus also determines a quantitative pigment intensity trait. The trait exhibits incomplete dominance at the organismal level, but the usual $F_2$ categorical scoring by three classes (dark, intermediate, light) yields an apparent $1:2:1$ ratio that does not reveal which allele is partially dominant because the intermediate class is phenotypically distinct and collapses all heterozygotes.\n\nYou perform the following crosses and measurements, using large sample sizes so that sample means equal their expectations:\n- Parental line $A_1A_1$ has mean pigment intensity $30$ (arbitrary units).\n- Parental line $A_2A_2$ has mean pigment intensity $60$.\n- A single confirmed $A_1A_2$ heterozygote (verified by the codominant enzyme phenotype) is backcrossed to each parental homozygote, yielding two backcross families.
