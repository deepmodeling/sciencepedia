The karyotype of a biologically male individual is represented as 46,XY. During spermatogenesis, this diploid cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid gametes.\n\nConsider a specific error in meiosis where nondisjunction of chromosome 13 occurs during Meiosis I in a primary spermatocyte of a human male. Nondisjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate properly. Assume that all other chromosomes, including the sex chromosomes, segregate normally.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the standard karyotypes of the four sperm cells that would result from this single meiotic event?\n\nA. One gamete with karyotype 24,X,+13; one gamete with 22,X,-13; and two gametes with 23,Y.\n\nB. Two gametes with karyotype 23,X; and two gametes with 23,Y.\n\nC.

Nondisjunction of chromosome $13$ in Meiosis I means the homologous pair of chromosome $13$ fails to separate at Anaphase I, so both homologs migrate to the same pole, while all other homologous pairs, including $X$ versus $Y$, segregate normally.\n\nTherefore, at the end of Meiosis I, two secondary spermatocytes form:\n- One is disomic for chromosome $13$ (carries both homologs) and carries one sex chromosome (say $X$); denote this cell as $+13,+13;X$.\n- The other is nullisomic for chromosome $13$ (carries no copy of $13$) and carries the other sex chromosome ($Y$); denote this cell as $-13,-13;Y$.\n\nIn Meiosis II, sister chromatids separate:\n- The disomic secondary spermatocyte ($+13,+13;X$) contains two homologs of chromosome $13$ (each with sister chromatids prior to division). After Meiosis II, each of its two sperm receives one chromatid from each homolog, resulting in gametes that each have one copy of chromosome $13$ from each homolog, i.e., an extra copy relative to haploid: two gametes with karyotype $24,X,+13$.\n- The nullisomic secondary spermatocyte ($-13,-13;Y$) lacks chromosome $13$, so after Meiosis II both resulting sperm still lack chromosome $13$: two gametes with karyotype $22,Y,-13$.\n\nAll four gametes are aneuploid after a Meiosis I nondisjunction event; there are no normal $23$-chromosome gametes in this scenario.

This practice ([@problem_id:2785862]) explores the powerful molecular techniques used to pinpoint the origin of a trisomy by analyzing patterns of genetic markers. Differentiating between a meiosis I and meiosis II error by observing centromere-proximal heterozygosity is not just an academic puzzle; it has profound implications for understanding risk factors and recurrence patterns of aneuploid conditions.", "problem": "A laboratory investigates the stage of origin of an autosomal trisomy by genotyping a dense panel of short tandem repeat (STR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers spanning a chromosome, including multiple markers lying within a very small recombination fraction ($1\\%$) from the centromere. It is known from parental genotypes and allele-dosage that the extra copy is maternal. The lab wants to use centromere-proximal genotype patterns to distinguish meiosis I from meiosis II nondisjunction in the mother. Which statements correctly capture how centromere-proximal heterozygosity informs this distinction under standard meiotic biology?\n\nChoose all that apply.\n\nA. If, at markers tightly linked to the centromere, the trisomic individual carries two different maternal alleles (maternal heterodisomy) in addition to the paternal allele (e.g., three-allele profiles or a 1:1:1 dosage pattern when all alleles differ), this most parsimoniously indicates a meiosis I nondisjunction in the mother.\n\nB. If, at markers tightly linked to the centromere, the trisomic individual carries two identical maternal alleles (maternal isodisomy) plus a paternal allele (e.g., two-allele profiles with a 2:1 dosage skew favoring one maternal allele), this most parsimoniously indicates a meiosis II nondisjunction in the mother.\n\nC.

Because recombination can occur anywhere, including very near the centromere with non-negligible probability, centromere-proximal heterozygosity cannot meaningfully distinguish meiosis I from meiosis II nondisjunction.\n\nE. In the presence of one or more crossovers distal to the centromere, a meiosis I nondisjunction often produces a transition from centromere-proximal maternal heterodisomy to telomeric maternal isodisomy, whereas meiosis II nondisjunction typically shows the opposite pattern (centromere-proximal maternal isodisomy with possible distal heterodisomy if a crossover occurred between the centromere and the telomere).", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It describes a standard scenario in human genetics for determining the meiotic stage of a nondisjunction event using DNA markers. The premises are scientifically sound and the question is well-posed, asking for a correct description of the underlying biological principles.\n\nLet us begin with a formal analysis based on the principles of meiosis. A maternal primary oocyte contains a pair of homologous chromosomes for the autosome in question. Let us denote the maternally-inherited homolog as $M_{p}$ and the paternally-inherited homolog as $M_{f}$. We assume the mother is heterozygous for a genetic marker tightly linked to the centromere, carrying allele $A_{1}$ on $M_{p}$ and allele $A_{2}$ on $M_{f}$.\n\nBefore meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs during the S phase. The chromosome pair now consists of two replicated homologous chromosomes. $M_{p}$ is composed of two identical sister chromatids, both carrying allele $A_{1}$. $M_{f}$ is composed of two identical sister chromatids, both carrying allele $A_{2}$. The structure is a bivalent containing four chromatids.\n\nThe problem specifies markers are \"tightly linked to the centromere\" with a recombination fraction of $1\\%$. This means crossing over between the marker locus and the centromere is a rare event. For the most parsimonious explanation, we assume no crossover occurs in this centromere-proximal region.\n\nCase 1: Meiosis I Nondisjunction\nIn meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are supposed to segregate. A nondisjunction event at this stage means the entire bivalent, containing both the $M_{p}$ and $M_{f}$ replicated homologs, moves to the secondary oocyte. The first polar body receives no chromosome of this type. Meiosis II then proceeds normally, separating the sister chromatids. The resulting gamete (ovum) will contain one unreplicated chromosome derived from $M_{p}$ and one unreplicated chromosome derived from $M_{f}$. Consequently, the ovum is disomic, carrying both alleles $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$. Upon fertilization by a normal paternal gamete carrying allele $A_{3}$, the resulting trisomic zygote will have the genotype $A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}$. The presence of two different maternal alleles ($A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$) is termed **maternal heterodisomy**. This is the characteristic signature of a meiosis I error for centromere-proximal markers.\n\nCase 2: Meiosis II Nondisjunction\nIn this scenario, meiosis I proceeds correctly. The homologous chromosomes $M_{p}$ and $M_{f}$ segregate. The secondary oocyte receives one replicated homolog (e.g., $M_{p}$ containing two sister chromatids both with allele $A_{1}$), while the first polar body receives the other ($M_{f}$). Nondisjunction then occurs during meiosis II, where the sister chromatids fail to separate. The resulting ovum receives both sister chromatids from the $M_{p}$ homolog. The ovum is thus disomic and carries two identical copies of allele $A_{1}$. Upon fertilization by a normal paternal gamete carrying allele $A_{3}$, the trisomic zygote will have the genotype $A_{1}A_{1}A_{3}$. The presence of two identical maternal alleles ($A_{1}$ and $A_{1}$) is termed **maternal isodisomy**. This is the characteristic signature of a meiosis II error for centromere-proximal markers.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\nA. If, at markers tightly linked to the centromere, the trisomic individual carries two different maternal alleles (maternal heterodisomy) in addition to the paternal allele (e.g., three-allele profiles or a 1:1:1 dosage pattern when all alleles differ), this most parsimoniously indicates a meiosis I nondisjunction in the mother.\nThis statement is a precise summary of our derivation for Case 1. The failure of homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis I results in a gamete containing both homologs, leading to heterodisomy for any heterozygous loci. The term \"most parsimoniously\" correctly accounts for the assumption that a single nondisjunction event is the cause, rather than more complex scenarios.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. If, at markers tightly linked to the centromere, the trisomic individual carries two identical maternal alleles (maternal isodisomy) plus a paternal allele (e.g., two-allele profiles with a 2:1 dosage skew favoring one maternal allele), this most parsimoniously indicates a meiosis II nondisjunction in the mother.\nThis statement is a precise summary of our derivation for Case 2. The failure of sister chromatids to separate in meiosis II results in a gamete containing two identical chromosome copies, leading to isodisomy. The dosage skew of 2:1 is the expected quantitative result from genotyping.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Centromere-proximal heterozygosity in the duplicated maternal contribution is the hallmark of meiosis II nondisjunction, whereas centromere-proximal homozygosity is the hallmark of meiosis I nondisjunction, because crossing over in meiosis I makes sisters non-identical near the centromere.\nThis statement is factually inverted. As derived above, centromere-proximal heterozygosity (heterodisomy) is the hallmark of a meiosis I error, and homozygosity (isodisomy) is the hallmark of a meiosis II error. The provided reasoning is also flawed. Crossing over occurs between *non-sister* chromatids, and for regions tightly linked to the centromere, it is a rare event that does not define the standard outcome. In the absence of such a rare crossover, sister chromatids remain identical.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Because recombination can occur anywhere, including very near the centromere with non-negligible probability, centromere-proximal heterozygosity cannot meaningfully distinguish meiosis I from meiosis II nondisjunction.\nThis statement is an invalid generalization. While recombination is possible near the centromere, its frequency is significantly suppressed (a phenomenon known as centromere interference). The problem itself defines the region with a recombination fraction $1\\%$. This low probability means the distinction is statistically powerful and highly meaningful. A meiosis II error can only produce apparent heterodisomy if a crossover occurs between the centromere and the marker locus. For a marker with $1\\%$ recombination, this will be the explanation in fewer than $1\\%$ of meiosis II error cases. Therefore, the method is indeed meaningful.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In the presence of one or more crossovers distal to the centromere, a meiosis I nondisjunction often produces a transition from centromere-proximal maternal heterodisomy to telomeric maternal isodisomy, whereas meiosis II nondisjunction typically shows the opposite pattern (centromere-proximal maternal isodisomy with possible distal heterodisomy if a crossover occurred between the centromere and the telomere).\nLet us analyze this with a distal crossover. Let the maternal homologs be $C_{1}T_{1}$ and $C_{2}T_{2}$, where $C$ is the centromeric marker and $T$ is the telomeric marker. After replication and a single crossover between non-sister chromatids, the four chromatids in the bivalent are $C_{1}T_{1}$, $C_{1}T_{2}$, $C_{2}T_{1}$, and $C_{2}T_{2}$.\n- For a meiosis I error, the gamete receives a chromosome derived from the $C_1$ centromere and one from the $C_2$ centromere. The segregation of chromatids in meiosis II can result in a gamete containing, for example, the chromatids $C_{1}T_{1}$ and $C_{2}T_{1}$. This represents centromeric heterodisomy ($C_{1}C_{2}$) and telomeric isodisomy ($T_{1}T_{1}$). The statement is correct for meiosis I.\n- For a meiosis II error, meiosis I segregates homologs correctly. The secondary oocyte might receive the replicated homolog with chromatids $C_{1}T_{1}$ and $C_{1}T_{2}$. If these sister chromatids fail to separate, the gamete contains both. This represents centromeric isodisomy ($C_{1}C_{1}$) and telomeric heterodisomy ($T_{1}T_{2}$). The statement is also correct for meiosis II.\nThis describes the powerful technique of mapping the transition point from isodisomy to heterodisomy to locate the position of meiotic crossovers.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2785862"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the biology of nondisjunction is crucial for interpreting modern diagnostic tools, which are rarely perfect.
