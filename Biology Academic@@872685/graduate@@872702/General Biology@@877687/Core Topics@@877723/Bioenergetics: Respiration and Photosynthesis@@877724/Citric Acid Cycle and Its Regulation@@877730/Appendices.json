Under the initial baseline condition, there is no citrate export to the cytosol, and $\\mathrm{OAA}$ concentration is maintained constant by the existing network fluxes.\n\nNow impose a lipogenic condition in which a fraction $f = 0.30$ of the mitochondrial citrate produced is diverted to the cytosol, where it is cleaved by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase into cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (used for fatty acid synthesis) and cytosolic $\\mathrm{OAA}$.

The derivation must be based on the first principles of mass conservation.\n\nThe central principle for this problem is the maintenance of a steady state for the total pool of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates within the mitochondrion. At steady state, the concentration of any intermediate, and thus the total pool size, remains constant over time. This implies that the total rate of influx of carbon skeletons into the cycle (anaplerosis) must exactly balance the total rate of efflux of carbon skeletons from the cycle (cataplerosis). Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum v_{\\text{anaplerosis}} = \\sum v_{\\text{cataplerosis}}\n$$\n\nWe will analyze the system under two conditions: the initial baseline state and the subsequent lipogenic state.\n\n**Condition 1: Baseline Steady State**\n\nIn the initial state, the TCA cycle is operating at a steady state. The flux through citrate synthase is given as $v_{\\mathrm{CS},1} = 12.0$ nmol·min$^{-1}$·mg$^{-1}$ protein. The problem explicitly states that there is no citrate export to the cytosol. The export of TCA cycle intermediates is a form of cataplerosis.

Assuming it is the only significant anaplerotic flux under consideration, we have:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{PC},1} = 0\n$$\nThis result is logical: in a closed cycle with no leakage of intermediates, no compensating influx is required to maintain the pool.\n\n**Condition 2: Lipogenic Steady State**\n\nA new lipogenic condition is imposed. A fraction $f = 0.30$ of the citrate produced by citrate synthase is diverted from the mitochondrion to the cytosol. The citrate synthase flux, $v_{\\mathrm{CS}}$, which represents the rate of citrate production, is given as a baseline value of $v_{\\mathrm{CS}} = 12.0$ nmol·min$^{-1}$·mg$^{-1}$ protein. The problem asks what change is needed to maintain a constant mitochondrial $\\mathrm{OAA}$ concentration, which implies a new steady state must be achieved for the TCA cycle intermediate pool, with this same rate of citrate synthesis.\n\nThe export of citrate constitutes a cataplerotic flux, as it removes carbon skeletons from the mitochondrial TCA cycle pool. The rate of this cataplerotic flux, $v_{\\text{export}}$, is directly proportional to the citrate synthase flux and the fraction exported:\n$$\nv_{\\text{export}} = f \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{CS}}\n$$\nEach molecule of citrate exported represents the net loss of the carbon skeleton of one molecule of $\\mathrm{OAA}$ from the mitochondrial pool. The problem states that the carbons from the resulting cytosolic $\\mathrm{OAA}$ do not re-enter the mitochondrial $\\mathrm{OAA}$ pool, confirming this is a true cataplerotic loss.\n\nThe total cataplerotic flux in the lipogenic state is therefore:\n$$\n\\sum v_{\\text{cataplerosis},2} = v_{\\text{export}} = f \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{CS}}\n$$\nTo achieve the new steady state and maintain the constancy of the TCA cycle intermediate pool, the anaplerotic flux must increase to precisely match this new cataplerotic efflux.
