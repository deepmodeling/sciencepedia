The rate of change of concentration in a well-mixed compartment is the sum of all production rates minus the sum of all consumption and export rates.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations**\n\nLet $x_{p}(t)$ be the concentration of $\\mathrm{H_{2}O_{2}}$ in the peroxisome and $x_{c}(t)$ be the concentration in the cytosol. We construct the differential equations based on the provided reaction and transport rates.\n\nFor the peroxisomal compartment (volume $V_{p}$), the concentration $x_{p}$ changes due to three processes:\n1.  Production by Acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX). The problem specifies this rate as $v_{\\mathrm{ACOX}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{A} E_{A} \\frac{S}{K_{M}^{A} + S}$. Since the parameters $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{A}$, $E_{A}$, $S$, and $K_{M}^{A}$ are constants, this production rate is a constant, which we shall denote as $v_{prod}$.\n    $$v_{prod} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{A} E_{A} \\frac{S}{K_{M}^{A} + S}$$\n2.  Consumption by catalase. This follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to $x_{p}$, given by the rate $v_{\\mathrm{cat}}(x_{p}) = V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{x_{p}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}}$.\n3.  Diffusion to the cytosol. The net rate of loss from the peroxisome is given as a term proportional to the concentration difference, $k(x_{p} - x_{c})$, where $k$ is a first-order rate constant.\n\nCombining these terms, the mass balance equation for $x_{p}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dx_{p}}{dt} = v_{prod} - V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{x_{p}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}} - k(x_{p} - x_{c}) $$\n\nFor the cytosolic compartment (volume $V_{c}$), the concentration $x_{c}$ changes due to:\n1.  Diffusion from the peroxisome. The problem states this gain term is $\\alpha(x_{p} - x_{c})$, where $\\alpha = k \\frac{V_{p}}{V_{c}}$. This relation ensures conservation of mass, as the total number of moles leaving the peroxisome per unit time, $V_{p} \\cdot k(x_{p} - x_{c})$, must equal the total number of moles entering the cytosol, $V_{c} \\cdot \\alpha(x_{p} - x_{c})$.\n2.  Other cytosolic processes, which are explicitly to be neglected.\n\nThus, the mass balance equation for $x_{c}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dx_{c}}{dt} = \\alpha(x_{p} - x_{c}) $$\n\nThe complete system of coupled ordinary differential equations is:\n$$ \\begin{cases} \\frac{dx_{p}}{dt} = v_{prod} - V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{x_{p}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}} - k(x_{p} - x_{c}) \\\\ \\frac{dx_{c}}{dt} = \\alpha(x_{p} - x_{c}) \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $v_{prod}$ is the constant production rate defined above.\n\n**2. Steady-State Analysis and Stability**\n\nTo find the steady state(s) $(x_{p}^{\\ast}, x_{c}^{\\ast})$, we set the time derivatives to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dx_{p}}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dx_{c}}{dt} = 0 $$\nFrom the second equation, $\\alpha(x_{p}^{\\ast} - x_{c}^{\\ast}) = 0$. Since $\\alpha = k \\frac{V_{p}}{V_{c}} > 0$, this requires that $x_{p}^{\\ast} = x_{c}^{\\ast}$. This is logical: in the absence of any consumption mechanism in the cytosol, the concentration must equilibrate with the peroxisome at steady state to achieve zero net flux.\n\nSubstituting $x_{c}^{\\ast} = x_{p}^{\\ast}$ into the first equation gives:\n$$ 0 = v_{prod} - V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{x_{p}^{\\ast}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast}} - k(x_{p}^{\\ast} - x_{p}^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ v_{prod} = V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{x_{p}^{\\ast}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast}} $$\nThis equation is to be solved for $x_{p}^{\\ast}$. Rearranging the terms:\n$$ v_{prod} (K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast}) = V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} x_{p}^{\\ast} $$\n$$ v_{prod} K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + v_{prod} x_{p}^{\\ast} = V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} x_{p}^{\\ast} $$\n$$ v_{prod} K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} = (V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} - v_{prod}) x_{p}^{\\ast} $$\nProvided that $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\neq v_{prod}$, we obtain the unique steady-state concentration:\n$$ x_{p}^{\\ast} = \\frac{v_{prod} K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}}{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} - v_{prod}} $$\nSince $x_{c}^{\\ast} = x_{p}^{\\ast}$, the complete steady state is $(x_{p}^{\\ast}, x_{p}^{\\ast})$. For a physically meaningful non-negative concentration, we must have $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} > v_{prod}$. This condition implies that the maximal catalytic removal capacity must exceed the production rate.\n\nTo determine local stability, we linearize the system around the steady state by computing the Jacobian matrix $J$:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{p}} (\\frac{dx_{p}}{dt}) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{c}} (\\frac{dx_{p}}{dt}) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{p}} (\\frac{dx_{c}}{dt}) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{c}} (\\frac{dx_{c}}{dt}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{p}} (\\frac{dx_{p}}{dt}) = -V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}}{(K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p})^2} - k $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{c}} (\\frac{dx_{p}}{dt}) = k $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{p}} (\\frac{dx_{c}}{dt}) = \\alpha $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{c}} (\\frac{dx_{c}}{dt}) = -\\alpha $$\nEvaluating the Jacobian at the steady state $(x_{p}^{\\ast}, x_{c}^{\\ast}) = (x_{p}^{\\ast}, x_{p}^{\\ast})$:\n$$ J^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} -V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}}{(K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast})^2} - k & k \\\\ \\alpha & -\\alpha \\end{pmatrix} $$\nStability is determined by the eigenvalues of $J^{\\ast}$. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, the steady state is locally stable if and only if the trace is negative ($\\mathrm{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) < 0$) and the determinant is positive ($\\det(J^{\\ast}) > 0$).\nThe trace is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) = -V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}}{(K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast})^2} - k - \\alpha $$\nSince all parameters ($V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}}$, $K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}$, $k$, $\\alpha$) are positive, and $(K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast})^2$ is positive, each term is negative. Thus, $\\mathrm{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) < 0$.\nThe determinant is:\n$$ \\det(J^{\\ast}) = \\left( -V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}}{(K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast})^2} - k \\right) (-\\alpha) - (k)(\\alpha) $$\n$$ \\det(J^{\\ast}) = \\alpha V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}}{(K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast})^2} + k\\alpha - k\\alpha = \\alpha V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}}{(K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} + x_{p}^{\\ast})^2} $$\nAs all parameters are positive, $\\det(J^{\\ast}) > 0$.\nSince both stability conditions are met, the unique steady state is always locally asymptotically stable, provided it exists ($V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} > v_{prod}$).\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given parameter values to compute $x_{p}^{\\ast}$.\nFirst, calculate the constant production rate $v_{prod}$:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{A} = 40\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $E_{A} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $S = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $K_{M}^{A} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$ v_{prod} = (40) (0.4) \\frac{30}{20 + 30} = 16 \\frac{30}{50} = 16 \\times 0.6 = 9.6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nThe remaining parameters are:\n$V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} = 12000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}} = 10000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe existence condition $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} > v_{prod}$ is satisfied, as $12000 > 9.6$.\n\nNow we calculate $x_{p}^{\\ast}$ using the derived formula:\n$$ x_{p}^{\\ast} = \\frac{v_{prod} K_{M}^{\\mathrm{cat}}}{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{cat}} - v_{prod}} = \\frac{(9.6) (10000)}{12000 - 9.6} $$\n$$ x_{p}^{\\ast} = \\frac{96000}{11990.4} \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M} \\approx 8.006405 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the peroxisomal steady-state concentration is:\n$$ x_{p}^{\\ast} \\approx 8.006 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.006}\n$$", "id": "2822285"}]}
