This exercise builds crucial skills in data synthesis, linking specific molecular signatures to a protein's progression through the distinct functional compartments of the Golgi apparatus.", "problem": "A secreted mammalian glycoprotein (GPX) contains $3$ predicted Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs and is synthesized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. You immunoprecipitate GPX from cells under four genetic or pharmacologic conditions and analyze its N-glycan processing by: (i) endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) immunoblotting for GPX, and (ii) lectin blotting with concanavalin A (ConA), Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (L-PHA), and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA). Use the following well-tested facts as your fundamental base: (a) N-linked glycans are transferred in the ER as $\\text{Glc}_{3}\\text{Man}_{9}\\text{GlcNAc}_{2}$ and trimmed to high-mannose forms; (b) cis/medial Golgi mannosidase I and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (MGAT1) initiate conversion toward complex-type glycans, with subsequent medial/trans Golgi processing (mannosidase II, MGAT2, MGAT5, galactosyltransferases, sialyltransferases); (c) Endo H cleaves high-mannose (and certain hybrid) N-glycans, but not mature complex-type; PNGase F removes nearly all N-glycans from mammalian glycoproteins; (d) ConA binds high-mannose; L-PHA preferentially binds $\\beta 1,6$-branched complex N-glycans (MGAT5 product); SNA binds $\\alpha 2,6$-linked sialic acid on complex N-glycans.\n\nObserved datasets for GPX under four conditions (all bands are detected by anti-GPX antibody unless indicated otherwise):\n- Wild type: Untreated lane shows a diffuse band centered at approximately $135$ kilodalton (kDa). Endo H leaves the major band unchanged, with a minor faster shoulder disappearing. PNGase F collapses the signal to a sharp $95$ kDa band. Lectin blots on the immunoprecipitated GPX show strong L-PHA and SNA signals, and minimal ConA signal.\n- MGAT1 knockout: Untreated lane shows a band at approximately $118$ kDa. Endo H collapses the band to $95$ kDa. PNGase F also yields a $95$ kDa band. Lectin blots show strong ConA, no L-PHA, and no SNA.\n- Kifunensine treatment (class I $\\alpha$-mannosidase inhibitor): Untreated lane shows a band at approximately $120$ kDa.

Lectin blots show strong ConA, no L-PHA, and no SNA.\n- ST6GAL1 knockout (loss of $\\alpha 2,6$-sialyltransferase): Untreated lane shows a diffuse band centered near $127$ kDa. Endo H leaves the band unchanged. PNGase F collapses it to $95$ kDa. Lectin blots show strong L-PHA, no SNA, and minimal ConA.\n\nWhich option best integrates these data to assign the predominant N-glycan class and the furthest Golgi processing stage reached by GPX in each condition?\n\nA. Wild type: complex-type, $\\beta 1,6$-branched and $\\alpha 2,6$-sialylated (Endo H resistant), indicating progression through medial to trans Golgi; MGAT1 knockout: high-mannose (Endo H sensitive), pre-medial Golgi processing state; Kifunensine: high-mannose (Endo H sensitive), pre-medial Golgi processing state; ST6GAL1 knockout: complex-type, $\\beta 1,6$-branched but asialo (Endo H resistant), indicating post-medial Golgi maturation without $\\alpha 2,6$ sialylation.\n\nB. Wild type: complex-type but asialo (Endo H resistant), indicating arrest before trans Golgi; MGAT1 knockout: hybrid/complex (Endo H resistant) due to bypass of MGAT1; Kifunensine: complex-type (Endo H resistant) because mannosidase inhibition preserves complex structures; ST6GAL1 knockout: high-mannose (Endo H sensitive) due to failed sialylation.\n\nC.

All provided information is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and sufficient for reaching a logical conclusion. The experimental design and the associated data are realistic and adhere to established principles of N-linked glycosylation. Therefore, the problem is valid, and I will proceed with a full analysis.\n\nThe analysis is predicated on decoding the state of N-glycans on the glycoprotein GPX under different conditions. The reference point for molecular weight is the polypeptide backbone, which is revealed by peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion. PNGase F cleaves nearly all N-glycans, producing a sharp band at $95$ kilodaltons (kDa). This is the mass of the GPX protein without any N-glycans. The protein has $3$ potential N-glycosylation sites. The analysis proceeds by interpreting the shifts in molecular weight on SDS-PAGE and the results of lectin blotting and endoglycosidase H (Endo H) digestion for each of the four conditions.\n\n**1. Wild Type (WT) Condition**\n\n*   **SDS-PAGE and Digestion:** The untreated protein runs as a diffuse band at approximately $135$ kDa. The diffuseness reflects heterogeneity in glycan structures (glycoforms). Upon treatment with Endo H, the major band at $135$ kDa remains, indicating it is **Endo H resistant**. This is the defining characteristic of mature, **complex-type** N-glycans. The disappearance of a minor, faster-migrating shoulder indicates a small population of Endo H-sensitive high-mannose or hybrid precursors, which is expected in steady-state synthesis. The mass contribution of the mature glycans is approximately $135 \\text{ kDa} - 95 \\text{ kDa} = 40 \\text{ kDa}$.\n*   **Lectin Blotting:** The minimal signal from concanavalin A (ConA), which binds high-mannose structures, confirms that the predominant glycoforms are not of the high-mannose type. The strong signal from *Phaseolus vulgaris* leucoagglutinin (L-PHA) indicates the presence of **$\\beta 1,6$-branched** complex N-glycans, which are synthesized by the medial/trans-Golgi enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5). The strong signal from *Sambucus nigra* agglutinin (SNA) indicates the presence of terminal **$\\alpha 2,6$-linked sialic acid**, a modification added by sialyltransferases in the trans-Golgi.\n*   **Conclusion:** In wild-type cells, GPX is processed through the entire Golgi apparatus to acquire mature, complex-type N-glycans that are $\\beta 1,6$-branched and terminally sialylated.\n\n**2. MGAT1 Knockout (KO) Condition**\n\n*   **SDS-PAGE and Digestion:** The untreated protein runs as a band at approximately $118$ kDa. Crucially, treatment with Endo H causes this band to collapse to $95$ kDa, the size of the polypeptide backbone. This demonstrates complete **Endo H sensitivity**, which is the hallmark of **high-mannose** type N-glycans. The enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (MGAT1) is located in the cis/medial-Golgi and is required to initiate the conversion of high-mannose glycans to hybrid and complex types. Its absence traps the glycans in a high-mannose state. The glycan mass is approximately $118 \\text{ kDa} - 95 \\text{ kDa} = 23 \\text{ kDa}$.\n*   **Lectin Blotting:** The strong ConA signal confirms the high-mannose nature of the glycans. The absence of L-PHA and SNA signals is expected, as the structures they recognize are only formed on complex glycans, a pathway that is blocked by the MGAT1 knockout.\n*   **Conclusion:** In MGAT1 knockout cells, GPX glycosylation is arrested at the high-mannose stage, indicating a failure to progress past the cis/medial-Golgi checkpoint for complex glycan synthesis.\n\n**3. Kifunensine Treatment Condition**\n\n*   **SDS-PAGE and Digestion:** Kifunensine is a specific inhibitor of class I $\\alpha$-mannosidases, including Golgi mannosidase I. This enzyme is required to trim high-mannose structures (e.g., $\\text{Man}_{9}\\text{GlcNAc}_{2}$) to create the substrate for MGAT1. Inhibiting mannosidase I therefore prevents the formation of complex glycans. The untreated protein is at approximately $120$ kDa and, like in the MGAT1 KO, collapses to $95$ kDa upon Endo H digestion. This indicates the glycans are fully **Endo H sensitive** and thus of the **high-mannose** type. The glycan mass is approximately $120 \\text{ kDa} - 95 \\text{ kDa} = 25 \\text{ kDa}$. This is slightly larger than in the MGAT1 KO, consistent with trapping at an earlier mannose-trimming step ($\\text{Man}_{9}$ vs. $\\text{Man}_{5}$).\n*   **Lectin Blotting:** The results mirror the MGAT1 KO: strong ConA signal and no L-PHA or SNA signal. This confirms the presence of high-mannose glycans and the block in processing prior to complex glycan formation.\n*   **Conclusion:** Kifunensine treatment phenocopies the MGAT1 knockout by blocking the glycosylation pathway at an early Golgi stage, resulting in GPX decorated with high-mannose N-glycans.\n\n**4. ST6GAL1 Knockout (KO) Condition**\n\n*   **SDS-PAGE and Digestion:** ST6GAL1 is a major $\\alpha 2,6$-sialyltransferase. The untreated protein is a diffuse band at approximately $127$ kDa. This band is **Endo H resistant**, which confirms the glycans are of the **complex-type**. The molecular weight is less than in wild-type cells ($127$ kDa vs. $135$ kDa), consistent with the loss of terminal sialic acid residues. The glycan mass is approximately $127 \\text{ kDa} - 95 \\text{ kDa} = 32 \\text{ kDa}$.\n*   **Lectin Blotting:** Minimal ConA signal confirms the absence of high-mannose glycans. A strong L-PHA signal indicates the glycans are **$\\beta 1,6$-branched**, meaning they have been processed by MGAT5 in the medial/trans-Golgi. The complete absence of an SNA signal confirms the lack of $\\alpha 2,6$-linked sialic acid, which is the direct consequence of the ST6GAL1 knockout.\n*   **Conclusion:** In ST6GAL1 knockout cells, GPX is processed to complex, branched N-glycans but lacks the terminal $\\alpha 2,6$-sialylation. Processing proceeds through the medial and trans-Golgi but fails at a specific terminal modification step.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Wild type: complex-type, $\\beta 1,6$-branched and $\\alpha 2,6$-sialylated (Endo H resistant), indicating progression through medial to trans Golgi; MGAT1 knockout: high-mannose (Endo H sensitive), pre-medial Golgi processing state; Kifunensine: high-mannose (Endo H sensitive), pre-medial Golgi processing state; ST6GAL1 knockout: complex-type, $\\beta 1,6$-branched but asialo (Endo H resistant), indicating post-medial Golgi maturation without $\\alpha 2,6$ sialylation.**\n    This option accurately summarizes the conclusions derived from the data for all four conditions. Each statement is consistent with the SDS-PAGE, enzyme digestion, and lectin blotting results.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Wild type: complex-type but asialo (Endo H resistant), indicating arrest before trans Golgi; ...**\n    This is incorrect. The strong SNA signal in the wild-type condition demonstrates the presence of sialic acid, a trans-Golgi modification.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Wild type: high-mannose (Endo H sensitive) with extensive sialylation detected by SNA; ...**\n    This is incorrect. The wild-type protein is Endo H resistant. Furthermore, sialylation occurs on complex, not high-mannose, glycans.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Wild type: high-mannose (ConA positive) but Endo H resistant due to O-glycans; ...**\n    This is incorrect. The wild-type protein shows minimal ConA signal, contradicting the \"high-mannose\" claim. The explanation of Endo H resistance due to O-glycans is speculative and irrelevant to the N-glycan analysis central to the problem.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that correctly integrates all experimental data is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2803156"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of sequential modification, this problem explores the temporal dimension of Golgi function.

This integrated analysis will allow you to determine the rate-limiting step for protein maturation, revealing whether it is governed by the pace of intracellular transport or the kinetics of enzymatic reactions.", "problem": "A newly synthesized type I membrane glycoprotein, Protein P, carries two N-linked glycans. In a pulse-chase experiment in a single mammalian cell type, cells are pulsed with radiolabeled amino acid and chased at $0$, $10$, $20$, $40$, and $80$ min. Immunoprecipitates of Protein P from each time point are split and subjected to digestion with either endoglycosidase H (Endo H; endoglycosidase H) or peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; peptide N-glycosidase F), followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In parallel, live-cell imaging measures compartmental transit of Protein P by colocalization with compartment markers.\n\nUse only the following foundational facts to reason about the data:\n- In the secretory pathway, proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) co-translationally, receive high-mannose N-linked glycans, exit the ER, and traverse the cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi, where N-glycans can be remodeled to complex forms. These complex N-glycans are typically resistant to Endo H.\n- Endo H cleaves high-mannose and some hybrid N-glycans but does not cleave fully processed complex N-glycans; PNGase F removes virtually all classes of N-glycans regardless of processing state.\n- Acquisition of Endo H resistance is generally taken to indicate passage through the medial-Golgi where N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (MGAT1) and subsequent enzymes act to initiate complex N-glycan formation.\n\nExperimental observations:\n- At $0$ and $10$ min, essentially all Protein P is Endo H sensitive (complete band shift upon Endo H; PNGase F causes an identical shift at all times), consistent with high-mannose glycans in the ER and early compartments.\n- At $20$ min, approximately $50\\%$ of Protein P is Endo H resistant (half the signal remains unshifted by Endo H), while PNGase F still fully removes glycans from both species.\n- At $40$ min, approximately $85\\%$ is Endo H resistant; at $80$ min, greater than $95\\%$ is Endo H resistant.\n- Live-cell imaging shows that the median time to ER exit is $8$ min, colocalization with a cis-Golgi marker peaks at $12$ min, with a medial-Golgi marker (MGAT1) at $16$ min, and with a trans-Golgi marker at $24$ min.\n\nAssuming no global perturbations to trafficking or enzyme expression beyond what is inherent to this cell type, which interpretation best explains whether glycan maturation per se accounts for the timing of N-glycan trimming evidenced by the Endo H sensitivity-to-resistance transition in this cell type?\n\nA. The timing of Endo H resistance is dominated by transit to the medial-Golgi; once Protein P reaches the medial-Golgi, maturation is rapid. Therefore, trafficking, not maturation kinetics, explains the observed Endo H resistance profile.\n\nB. The Endo H resistance profile indicates that glycan-processing enzymes act unusually slowly in this cell type; maturation, not compartmental transit, is the major determinant of the timing.\n\nC. Loss of Endo H sensitivity before arrival at the medial-Golgi shows that Endo H resistance is acquired in the ER during the calnexin cycle; trimming occurs primarily in the ER.\n\nD. Because PNGase F sensitivity persists at all time points, Protein P never matures; the observed Endo H resistance is likely an artifact unrelated to Golgi processing.", "solution": "The task is to analyze experimental data from a pulse-chase and a live-cell imaging experiment to determine whether protein trafficking or enzymatic reaction kinetics is the rate-limiting step for the acquisition of endoglycosidase H (Endo H) resistance by a glycoprotein, Protein P.\n\nFirst, a rigorous validation of the problem statement is performed.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Protein**: A type I membrane glycoprotein, Protein P, with two N-linked glycans.\n- **Experiment Type**: Pulse-chase with radiolabeled amino acid in a mammalian cell type, with chase times of $0$, $10$, $20$, $40$, and $80$ minutes.\n- **Analysis**: Immunoprecipitated Protein P is treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.\n- **Parallel Experiment**: Live-cell imaging to measure compartmental transit of Protein P.\n- **Foundational Facts**:\n    1.

Acquisition of Endo H resistance is a marker for passage through the medial-Golgi, where enzymes like N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (MGAT1) initiate complex glycan formation.\n- **Experimental Observations (Pulse-Chase)**:\n    - At $t=0$ and $t=10$ min: Protein P is \"essentially all\" Endo H sensitive.\n    - At $t=20$ min: Approximately $50\\%$ of Protein P is Endo H resistant.\n    - At $t=40$ min: Approximately $85\\%$ of Protein P is Endo H resistant.\n    - At $t=80$ min: Greater than $95\\%$ of Protein P is Endo H resistant.\n    - At all times, PNGase F digestion results in a full band shift, indicating complete removal of glycans.\n- **Experimental Observations (Live-cell imaging)**:\n    - Median time to ER exit: $8$ min.\n    - Peak colocalization with cis-Golgi marker: $12$ min.\n    - Peak colocalization with medial-Golgi marker (MGAT1): $16$ min.\n    - Peak colocalization with trans-Golgi marker: $24$ min.\n- **Question**: Is the timing of Endo H resistance acquisition determined by glycan maturation kinetics (*per se*) or by compartmental transit?\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a classic experimental paradigm in cell biology to dissect protein trafficking and post-translational modification. The principles of N-linked glycosylation, the secretory pathway, and the specific actions of Endo H and PNGase F are all factually correct and fundamental to the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides two distinct but complementary datasets (kinetic data on modification state and kinetic data on spatial location) and asks for a unifying interpretation. The question is clear, and the data allow for a logical deduction.\n- **Objective**: The data are presented quantitatively (percentages, times) and the language is technical and unbiased.\n\nThe problem is free of scientific unsoundness, vagueness, contradictions, or other flaws. The setup is realistic and represents a standard problem in biological data interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to resolve which of two sequential processes is rate-limiting:\n1.  **Transport**: The movement of Protein P from its site of synthesis to the medial-Golgi, where the relevant modifying enzymes reside.\n2.  **Maturation**: The enzymatic conversion of high-mannose glycans to complex glycans by enzymes such as MGAT1 within the medial-Golgi, which confers Endo H resistance.\n\nThe total time to acquire Endo H resistance is the sum of the time taken for transport and the time taken for maturation. The overall rate of the process is dictated by the slower step (the rate-limiting step).\n\nFrom the live-cell imaging data, we can construct a timeline for the transit of a typical Protein P molecule:\n- Median ER exit occurs at $t = 8$ min.\n- The population of molecules peaks in the cis-Golgi at $t = 12$ min.\n- The population of molecules peaks in the medial-Golgi (the site of modification) at $t = 16$ min.\n\nThis means that at $t=16$ min, the bulk of the newly synthesized Protein P population has arrived at the compartment where Endo H resistance can be acquired.\n\nFrom the pulse-chase experiment, we have the kinetics of the modification itself across the entire population of labeled proteins:\n- The half-time ($t_{1/2}$) for acquisition of Endo H resistance is approximately $20$ min, as this is the time point where $50\\%$ of the protein population has become resistant.\n\nNow, we compare the timing of arrival at the medial-Golgi with the timing of the modification.\n- Peak arrival at the site of modification (medial-Golgi): $t \\approx 16$ min.\n- Half-completion of the modification reaction: $t \\approx 20$ min.\n\nThe difference between these two characteristic times is $20 \\text{ min} - 16 \\text{ min} = 4$ min. This short duration indicates that once the bulk of the protein population reaches the medial-Golgi, it is rapidly converted to the Endo H-resistant form. The half-life of the enzymatic reaction itself (the time it takes for half the proteins *currently in the medial-Golgi* to be modified) must be on the order of these few minutes.\n\nIn contrast, the time required for transport to the medial-Golgi is significantly longer (on the order of $16$ min). Since the transport time ($ \\approx 16$ min) is much greater than the time for the reaction to proceed once the substrate has arrived ($ \\approx 4$ min for the next major fraction of the population), the rate-limiting step for the overall acquisition of Endo H resistance is the transport of Protein P to the medial-Golgi. The observed kinetics of resistance acquisition largely reflect the kinetics of protein trafficking.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The timing of Endo H resistance is dominated by transit to the medial-Golgi; once Protein P reaches the medial-Golgi, maturation is rapid. Therefore, trafficking, not maturation kinetics, explains the observed Endo H resistance profile.**\n- **Justification**: This conclusion is directly supported by the analysis above. The time required for transport to the medial-Golgi ($t \\approx 16$ min) is the major component of the overall time to acquire Endo H resistance ($t_{1/2} \\approx 20$ min). The small difference between these times implies that the enzymatic maturation step is fast.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The Endo H resistance profile indicates that glycan-processing enzymes act unusually slowly in this cell type; maturation, not compartmental transit, is the major determinant of the timing.**\n- **Justification**: This is contrary to the experimental evidence. If maturation were the slow, rate-limiting step, there would be a significant lag between the arrival of Protein P in the medial-Golgi ($t \\approx 16$ min) and the half-time of resistance acquisition. For example, if $t_{1/2}$ were $40$ min or longer, this would suggest that proteins accumulate in the medial-Golgi for an extended period before being modified. The data show only a short delay.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Loss of Endo H sensitivity before arrival at the medial-Golgi shows that Endo H resistance is acquired in the ER during the calnexin cycle; trimming occurs primarily in the ER.**\n- **Justification**: This statement contradicts the foundational facts provided. The acquisition of Endo H resistance is a hallmark of processing in the medial-Golgi, not the ER. Furthermore, the data show that at $t=10$ min, when Protein P has exited the ER but has not yet peaked in the medial-Golgi, it is still \"essentially all\" Endo H sensitive. Significant resistance only appears after the protein population reaches the medial-Golgi.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because PNGase F sensitivity persists at all time points, Protein P never matures; the observed Endo H resistance is likely an artifact unrelated to Golgi processing.**\n- **Justification**: This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the role of PNGase F. PNGase F removes N-linked glycans regardless of their maturation state (high-mannose or complex). Its continued ability to remove the glycans is the expected result and serves as a positive control, confirming that the changes in molecular weight are due to N-glycans. The persistence of PNGase F sensitivity does not imply a lack of maturation. The acquisition of Endo H resistance is the specific signal for maturation through the medial-Golgi.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2803158"}, {"introduction": "The enzymatic processes within the Golgi rely on a precisely regulated luminal environment, particularly its acidic $pH$.

Substituting this expression for $J_{\\text{leak}}$ into the dynamic equation gives the complete ordinary differential equation for $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}(t)$:\n$$\n\\beta \\,\\frac{d\\,\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}}{dt} \\;=\\; g_H \\,\\big( \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{cyt}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}} \\big) - J_{\\text{pump}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state luminal $\\mathrm{pH}$, denoted $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}^{\\ast}$. At steady state, the system variables are constant in time. This implies that the time derivative of the luminal $\\mathrm{pH}$ must be zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\,\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}}{dt} \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to the governing differential equation, we obtain an algebraic equation for the steady-state value $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; g_H \\,\\big( \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{cyt}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}^{\\ast} \\big) - J_{\\text{pump}}\n$$\nThis equation expresses the physical principle that at steady state, the rate of protons pumped into the lumen must be exactly balanced by the rate of protons leaking out: $J_{\\text{pump}} = J_{\\text{leak}}^{\\ast}$. Note that the buffering capacity $\\beta$ influences the time required to reach steady state, but not the value of the steady-state $\\mathrm{pH}$ itself.\n\nTo find $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}^{\\ast}$, we rearrange the steady-state equation:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{pump}} \\;=\\; g_H \\,\\big( \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{cyt}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}^{\\ast} \\big)\n$$\nDividing by the conductance $g_H$:\n$$\n\\frac{J_{\\text{pump}}}{g_H} \\;=\\; \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{cyt}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}^{\\ast}\n$$\nFinally, solving for $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}^{\\ast}$ gives the desired closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{lum}}^{\\ast} \\;=\\; \\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{cyt}} - \\frac{J_{\\text{pump}}}{g_H}\n$$\nThis result is in terms of the specified parameters $J_{\\text{pump}}$, $g_H$, and $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{cyt}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{cyt}} - \\frac{J_{\\text{pump}}}{g_H}}$$", "id": "2803169"}]}
