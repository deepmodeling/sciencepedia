It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cell population kinetics, is internally consistent, and is well-posed. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe fundamental premise is that the cell population grows exponentially in a steady state, characterized by a stable age distribution. The probability density function $p(a)$ for a cell to have an age $a$ within the cell cycle of duration $T_c$ is given as proportional to $\\exp(-\\lambda a)$, where $\\lambda$ is the population growth rate.\nLet $N_{total}$ be the total number of cells in the population. The number of cells with age between $a$ and $a+da$ is $dN = K \\exp(-\\lambda a) da$ for some normalization constant $K$.\nThe total number of cells is the integral over the entire cell cycle duration, $T_c$:\n$$N_{total} = \\int_{0}^{T_c} K \\exp(-\\lambda a) da = K \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda a) \\right]_{0}^{T_c} = \\frac{K}{\\lambda} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda T_c))$$\nFrom the provided assumptions, the cell cycle time $T_c$ equals the population doubling time $T_d$, and the growth rate is $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln 2}{T_d}$. Thus, the exponent $\\lambda T_c = \\frac{\\ln 2}{T_d} T_d = \\ln 2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $N_{total}$:\n$$N_{total} = \\frac{K}{\\lambda} (1 - \\exp(-\\ln 2)) = \\frac{K}{\\lambda} (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{K}{2\\lambda}$$\nThe number of cells $N_i$ in a specific phase $i$ that starts at age $a_{start}$ and ends at age $a_{end}$ is given by:\n$$N_i = \\int_{a_{start}}^{a_{end}} K \\exp(-\\lambda a) da = \\frac{K}{\\lambda} (\\exp(-\\lambda a_{start}) - \\exp(-\\lambda a_{end}))$$\nThe fraction of cells in phase $i$, denoted $f_i$, is the ratio $N_i / N_{total}$:\n$$f_i = \\frac{\\frac{K}{\\lambda} (\\exp(-\\lambda a_{start}) - \\exp(-\\lambda a_{end}))}{\\frac{K}{2\\lambda}} = 2 (\\exp(-\\lambda a_{start}) - \\exp(-\\lambda a_{end}))$$\nThis is the general relation between the fraction of cells in a phase and the start and end ages of that phase.\n\nWe can simplify this for any phase or sequence of phases that terminates at cell division (age $a_{end} = T_c$).

According to the problem statement, there are two mutually exclusive outcomes for a given end, each with a specified probability.\n\n1.  **Leading-strand synthesis:** The DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strand continuously in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction, proceeding all the way to the end of the template strand. In this idealized case, there is no loss of sequence. The shortening is $0$. The probability of this event is given as $1/2$.\n\n2.  **Lagging-strand synthesis:** The synthesis is discontinuous, using Okazaki fragments initiated by RNA primers. At the very end of the chromosome, the final RNA primer, of length $p$, is removed. The resulting single-stranded gap at the $5'$ end of the new strand cannot be filled by DNA polymerase because there is no pre-existing $3'$-hydroxyl group upstream. This results in the loss of $p$ nucleotides from the daughter chromosome after replication. The shortening is $p$. The probability of this event is given as $1/2$.\n\nThe expected shortening per division, $\\Delta L$, is the weighted average of the outcomes, where the weights are the probabilities of each event.\nLet $S$ be the random variable representing the shortening at a single end. Its expected value, $E[S]$, is $\\Delta L$.\n$$\n\\Delta L = (\\text{shortening if leading}) \\times P(\\text{leading}) + (\\text{shortening if lagging}) \\times P(\\text{lagging})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta L = (0) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (p) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta L = 0 + \\frac{p}{2} = \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nThe expected shortening at a single chromosomal end per cell division is $\\frac{p}{2}$ nucleotides. The parameter $s$, the mean length of Okazaki fragments, is irrelevant for this calculation, as the shortening is determined only by the length of the final, unreplaced primer.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Replicative Lifespan ($N^{\\star}$)**\nThe initial telomere length is $L_0$. The telomere shortens by an expected length of $\\Delta L = \\frac{p}{2}$ with each cell division. The problem assumes this expected loss occurs at each division. The telomere length after $N$ divisions, $L(N)$, can therefore be modeled as:\n$$\nL(N) = L_0 - N \\cdot \\Delta L = L_0 - N \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nThe replicative lifespan, $N^{\\star}$, is defined as the maximum number of full cell divisions that can occur before the telomere length falls strictly below the critical length $L_c$. This is equivalent to finding the largest integer $N$ for which the telomere length is greater than or equal to $L_c$. We therefore seek the maximum integer $N^{\\star}$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$\nL(N^{\\star}) \\ge L_c\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L(N^{\\star})$:\n$$\nL_0 - N^{\\star} \\frac{p}{2} \\ge L_c\n$$\nWe now solve this inequality for $N^{\\star}$.
