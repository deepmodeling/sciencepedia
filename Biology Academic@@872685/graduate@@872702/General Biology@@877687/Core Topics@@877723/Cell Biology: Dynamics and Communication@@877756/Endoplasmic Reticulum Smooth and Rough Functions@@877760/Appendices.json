The goal is to predict which polypeptides will be cotranslationally targeted to the rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) via Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and, for those that insert into the ER membrane, to predict their final topology. Use foundational facts that (i) SRP binds emerging hydrophobic signal sequences on ribosomes to direct cotranslational targeting to the ER, (ii) sufficiently long and hydrophobic segments often function as signal peptides or signal-anchor transmembrane domains, (iii) cleavage by the ER signal peptidase requires an accessible cleavage site with small residues at positions $-1$ and $-3$ relative to the scissile bond, and (iv) charge asymmetry across a hydrophobic segment biases topology such that the side with more positive charge tends to remain cytosolic (the “positive-inside” rule). Assume a typical transmembrane span has length approximately $18$–$25$ residues with an average hydropathy index $\\bar{H}$ sufficiently positive to partition into the lipid bilayer.\n\nThe four polypeptides are described as follows (from the N-terminus to the C-terminus):\n\n- Polypeptide P1: An N-terminal hydrophobic segment of length $22$ residues with average hydropathy $\\bar{H} = +2.1$, preceded by an N-region containing $+2$ net positive charge, followed immediately by a segment that includes a canonical signal peptidase motif with small residues at positions $-1$ and $-3$ (for example, Ala–X–Ala). Downstream of this region, there are no additional hydrophobic stretches longer than $10$ residues with $\\bar{H} > +1.0$.\n- Polypeptide P2: The first $34$ residues are moderately polar and include $+4$ net positive charge. Beginning at residue $35$ there is a hydrophobic segment of length $20$ residues with $\\bar{H} = +2.3$ and no credible signal peptidase motif near its C-terminal end. The $20$ residues immediately following this hydrophobic segment contain $+1$ net positive charge and are otherwise polar.\n- Polypeptide P3: Residues $5$–$25$ form a hydrophobic segment of length $21$ residues with $\\bar{H} = +2.2$ and no credible signal peptidase motif near its C-terminal end. Residues $1$–$4$ carry $+0$ net positive charge, whereas residues $26$–$45$ carry $+4$ net positive charge.\n- Polypeptide P4: Contains a hydrophobic stretch of length $12$ residues with $\\bar{H} = +0.7$ embedded within otherwise polar sequence. There is no signal peptidase motif and no clear clustering of positive charges on either side of this stretch (both flanks have $+0$ to $+1$ net positive charge).\n\nWhich option best classifies SRP recognition and the final topology for each polypeptide? Use the following topology terms: “soluble in ER lumen” (no transmembrane span after signal peptide cleavage), “type II” (single-pass with N-terminus in cytosol, C-terminus in ER lumen), and “type III” (single-pass with N-terminus in ER lumen, C-terminus in cytosol).\n\nA.

Followed by a canonical signal peptidase motif. No other significant downstream hydrophobic segments are present.\n- **Polypeptide P2**: Begins with $34$ polar residues containing a net charge of $+4$. Following this, a hydrophobic segment (residues $35$ to $54$) of length $20$, $\\bar{H} = +2.3$, with no signal peptidase motif. The subsequent $20$ residues have a net charge of $+1$.\n- **Polypeptide P3**: A hydrophobic segment from residue $5$ to $25$ (length $21$), $\\bar{H} = +2.2$, with no signal peptidase motif. Flanking charges are $+0$ for residues $1$–$4$ and $+4$ for residues $26$–$45$.\n- **Polypeptide P4**: A hydrophobic stretch of length $12$ residues, $\\bar{H} = +0.7$. No signal peptidase motif and flanking net charges are between $+0$ and $+1$.\n- **Topology definitions**: \"soluble in ER lumen\"; \"type II\" (N-terminus cytosolic, C-terminus lumenal); \"type III\" (N-terminus lumenal, C-terminus cytosolic).\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, testing established principles of protein translocation and membrane protein biogenesis. The data provided for each polypeptide—segment length, hydropathy, charge distribution, and presence/absence of cleavage sites—are specific, internally consistent, and sufficient for applying the given rules. The problem is well-posed, objective, and does not contain any factual errors, contradictions, or ambiguities. All values and descriptions are biologically plausible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is declared **valid**. A rigorous solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe fate of each polypeptide is determined by applying the given biophysical and biochemical rules.\n\n**Analysis of Polypeptide P1:**\n1.  **SRP Recognition**: The N-terminal segment has a length of $22$ residues and a high average hydropathy, $\\bar{H} = +2.1$. These characteristics are archetypal for a signal sequence that is recognized by the SRP (Facts (i) and (ii)). Thus, $P1$ will be targeted to the ER translocon.\n2.  **Translocation and Fate**: The presence of a canonical signal peptidase motif immediately following the hydrophobic segment indicates that it is a cleavable signal peptide (Fact (iii)). Upon translocation, this N-terminal signal sequence will be inserted into the translocon, threading the N-terminus into the ER lumen. The signal peptidase, an ER-lumenal enzyme, will cleave the polypeptide at this motif. The problem states there are no additional significant hydrophobic segments downstream. Therefore, after cleavage, the remainder of the polypeptide will be fully translocated into the ER lumen, becoming a soluble protein within that compartment.\n3.  **Conclusion for P1**: Recognized by SRP, signal peptide is cleaved, and the mature protein is soluble in the ER lumen.\n\n**Analysis of Polypeptide P2:**\n1.  **SRP Recognition**: This polypeptide possesses an internal hydrophobic segment of length $20$ residues with $\\bar{H} = +2.3$. This is sufficient for SRP recognition and to function as a signal-anchor sequence (Facts (i) and (ii)).\n2.  **Topology Determination**: The segment lacks a signal peptidase motif and will therefore permanently anchor the protein in the membrane. Its orientation is determined by the \"positive-inside\" rule (Fact (iv)). The N-terminal flank (residues $1$–$34$) has a net charge of $+4$. The C-terminal flank has a net charge of $+1$. Since the charge on the N-terminal side is significantly more positive ($+4 > +1$), this flank will be retained in the cytosol. Consequently, the N-terminus remains in the cytosol while the C-terminus is translocated into the ER lumen. This defines a **Type II** membrane protein.\n3.  **Conclusion for P2**: Recognized by SRP and integrated as a Type II transmembrane protein.\n\n**Analysis of Polypeptide P3:**\n1.  **SRP Recognition**: The polypeptide contains a hydrophobic segment (residues $5$–$25$) of length $21$ with $\\bar{H} = +2.2$. This qualifies as a signal-anchor sequence for SRP recognition and membrane insertion.\n2.  **Topology Determination**: Lacking a cleavage site, this segment will serve as a permanent transmembrane domain. We apply the \"positive-inside\" rule (Fact (iv)). The N-terminal flank (residues $1$–$4$) has a net charge of $+0$. The C-terminal flank (residues $26$–$45$) has a net charge of $+4$. The C-terminal side is overwhelmingly more positive ($+4 > +0$), so it will be retained in the cytosol. This orientation results in the N-terminus being translocated into the ER lumen and the C-terminus remaining in the cytosol. This defines a **Type III** membrane protein.\n3.  **Conclusion for P3**: Recognized by SRP and integrated as a Type III transmembrane protein.\n\n**Analysis of Polypeptide P4:**\n1.  **SRP Recognition**: The hydrophobic stretch is only $12$ residues long, which is substantially shorter than the typical $18$–$25$ residues required for stable membrane insertion and robust SRP binding. Furthermore, its average hydropathy, $\\bar{H} = +0.7$, is marginal. These characteristics make it a poor substrate for SRP.\n2.  **Fate**: It is highly improbable that SRP will efficiently recognize this polypeptide. Translation will complete on a free ribosome, and the resulting protein will remain in the cytosol.\n3.  **Conclusion for P4**: Not recognized by SRP and remains a cytosolic protein.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n- **Option A**: This option states: P1 becomes soluble in the ER lumen; P2 becomes type II; P3 becomes type III; P4 remains cytosolic. This sequence of outcomes is in perfect agreement with the step-by-step derivation above. Each prediction is correct based on the established principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **Option B**: This option claims P1 becomes type I. This is incorrect. A type I protein possesses a C-terminal transmembrane domain in addition to a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence; P1 lacks this. The option then incorrectly identifies P2 as type III and P3 as type II, reversing the correct topologies dictated by the \"positive-inside\" rule. Finally, it incorrectly claims P4 is recognized by SRP, contradicting the known requirements for SRP substrate recognition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option C**: This option correctly identifies the fates of P1 and P4. However, it incorrectly assigns P2 as type III and P3 as type II. This demonstrates a failure to correctly apply the \"positive-inside\" rule to the charge distributions provided for these two polypeptides.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option D**: This option incorrectly claims P1 is not cleaved, despite the presence of a canonical peptidase motif. It also incorrectly asserts that P2 and P3 both become type II \"regardless of charge distribution,\" a statement that directly violates Fact (iv), a fundamental rule of topology determination.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on rigorous application of the stated principles, only option A accurately describes the fate of all four polypeptides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2795690"}, {"introduction": "Entry into the ER lumen is only the first step; ensuring that proteins achieve their correct three-dimensional structure is a critical function of the organelle's quality control machinery.

The rate constant $k_{u}$ describes the kinetics of re-entry into the cycle for a non-native protein, but the problem's assumption that \"non-native clients are effectively always reglucosylated and re-enter the cycle\" simplifies the model such that the exact value of $k_{u}$ does not affect the *number* of cycles, only the time spent between them. This does not constitute a flaw but rather a test of understanding the core probabilistic event. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of binding cycles a glycoprotein undergoes before it successfully folds and exits the ER. This can be modeled as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial corresponds to one binding cycle.\n\nA binding cycle begins when the glycoprotein binds to calnexin. While bound, two independent, competing first-order processes occur:\n1.  **Folding:** The protein transitions from a non-native to a native state. This is a Poisson process with rate constant $k_{f}$.\n2.  **Release:** The terminal glucose is cleaved, and the protein is released from calnexin. This is a Poisson process with rate constant $k_{g}$.\n\nA \"successful\" cycle is one in which the protein folds into its native state *before* it is released from calnexin. If the protein folds first, its state becomes \"bound and native\". Subsequently, the release event (which must occur with rate $k_{g}$) will transition it to an \"unbound and native\" state. According to the problem statement, a native protein is not a substrate for UGGT and exits the ER. Thus, folding before release guarantees exit from the cycle.\n\nThe probability of success in a single trial, which we denote as $p$, is the probability that the folding event occurs before the release event. For two independent competing Poisson processes with rates $k_{f}$ and $k_{g}$, the probability that the event with rate $k_{f}$ occurs first is given by:\n$$p = \\frac{k_{f}}{k_{f} + k_{g}}$$\n\nAn \"unsuccessful\" cycle occurs if the protein is released from calnexin *before* it has folded. The probability of this event is $1 - p$. In this case, the protein is in an \"unbound and non-native\" state. The problem states that such proteins are recognized by UGGT, reglucosylated, and re-enter the binding cycle. The assumption that folding is negligible in the unbound state and that non-native clients are always recycled means that an unsuccessful cycle inevitably leads to a new binding trial.\n\nThe process continues until the first successful cycle occurs. The number of trials, $N$, required to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials follows a geometric distribution with success probability $p$. The expected value of a geometrically distributed random variable $N$ (where $N$ counts the number of trials) is:\n$$E[N] = \\frac{1}{p}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p$, we find the expected number of cycles:\n$$E[N] = \\frac{k_{f} + k_{g}}{k_{f}} = 1 + \\frac{k_{g}}{k_{f}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the rate constants:\n$k_{f} = 0.010\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{g} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe expected number of cycles is:\n$$E[N] = 1 + \\frac{0.10}{0.010} = 1 + 10 = 11$$\n\nThe rate constant for reglucosylation, $k_{u} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, is not needed for this calculation, as it only affects the duration of the unbound phase between unsuccessful cycles, not the probability of success within a cycle or the total number of cycles.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
