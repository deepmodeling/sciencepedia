It presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of transcription initiation, a task appropriate for this analysis. We proceed with a solution derived from first principles.\n\nThe central premise is that promoter strength, which we denote by $P$, is proportional to the probability of forming the functional pre-initiation complex. The model specifies this complex requires both TATA-binding protein (TBP) and Transcription Factor IIB (TFIIB) to be simultaneously bound to their respective DNA motifs. In the framework of statistical thermodynamics, this probability is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, or statistical weight, of the doubly bound state. The promoter strength is therefore given by:\n$$P \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{total}}$ is the total free energy of the doubly bound state relative to a reference state of unbound components, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe total energy $E_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of three distinct contributions: the binding free energy of TBP ($E_{\\text{TBP}}$), the binding free energy of TFIIB ($E_{\\text{TFIIB}}$), and the energetic penalty due to a non-optimal promoter architecture ($\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{arch}}$). The problem states that TBP and TFIIB bind independently, so their binding energies are additive:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{TBP}} + E_{\\text{TFIIB}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{arch}}$$\n\nWe are given the relationships between binding free energy $E$, the equilibrium association constant $K$, and the Position Weight Matrix (PWM) score $S$:\n1. $E = -RT \\ln K$\n2. $S = \\ln K$\n\nFrom these two relations, we can express the binding free energy directly in terms of the PWM score:\n$$E = -RT S$$\nThus, for the two transcription factors:\n$$E_{\\text{TBP}} = -RT S_{\\text{TBP}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{TFIIB}} = -RT S_{\\text{TFIIB}}$$\n\nThe architectural penalty is modeled as a harmonic potential:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{arch}} = \\frac{1}{2}k(d-d_{0})^{2}$$\nwhere $k$ is a stiffness constant, $d$ is the center-to-center spacing of the motifs, and $d_{0}$ is the optimal spacing.\n\nSubstituting these energy components into the expression for $E_{\\text{total}}$ yields:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = -RT S_{\\text{TBP}} - RT S_{\\text{TFIIB}} + \\frac{1}{2}k(d-d_{0})^{2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this total energy into the expression for promoter strength $P$:\n$$P \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-RT S_{\\text{TBP}} - RT S_{\\text{TFIIB}} + \\frac{1}{2}k(d-d_{0})^{2}}{RT}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression within the exponent gives:\n$$P \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{RT(S_{\\text{TBP}} + S_{\\text{TFIIB}})}{RT} - \\frac{k(d-d_{0})^{2}}{2RT}\\right)$$\n$$P \\propto \\exp\\left(S_{\\text{TBP}} + S_{\\text{TFIIB}} - \\frac{k(d-d_{0})^{2}}{2RT}\\right)$$\n\nLet the constant of proportionality be $C$.
