While not fully saturated (which would imply occupancy greater than $90\\%$), it is significantly beyond a merely moderate response. Therefore, it is best classified as a response approaching saturation or simply a strong response.\n\nRegarding the direction of modulation, activation of GPR43 on neutrophils by short-chain fatty acids like acetate has been shown to modulate inflammatory responses, including chemotaxis. While context-dependent, a primary role of GPR43 activation is to prime neutrophils and potentiate their chemotactic response to other inflammatory cues, such as bacterial peptides or chemokines.
