## Introduction
Cellular metabolism is no longer viewed as a mere housekeeping function providing energy and building blocks. It has emerged as a central and dynamic regulator of immune cell fate and function, a concept at the heart of the rapidly evolving field of [immunometabolism](@entry_id:155926). This discipline bridges the once-separate domains of immunology and biochemistry, revealing that the metabolic state of an immune cell is inextricably linked to its ability to fight pathogens, tolerate self-antigens, or contribute to chronic disease. The central knowledge gap this article addresses is how, precisely, this metabolic control is executed and how it can be leveraged for therapeutic benefit. To build a comprehensive understanding, we will first delve into the foundational **Principles and Mechanisms**, dissecting the metabolic toolkit of immune cells, the signaling pathways that orchestrate [metabolic reprogramming](@entry_id:167260), and the direct link between metabolites and epigenetic control. Following this, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will demonstrate the power of this framework to understand disease, design new therapies, and forge connections with fields like [microbiology](@entry_id:172967) and epigenetics. Finally, a series of **Hands-On Practices** will provide an opportunity to apply these concepts in a quantitative and analytical context, solidifying the theoretical knowledge gained.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delineates the core principles and molecular mechanisms that govern the [metabolic control of immunity](@entry_id:155179). We will dissect the fundamental [metabolic pathways](@entry_id:139344) utilized by immune cells, explore the [signaling networks](@entry_id:754820) that orchestrate [metabolic reprogramming](@entry_id:167260), and examine how these metabolic states are tailored to the specific functions of diverse immune cell lineages. Finally, we will investigate the profound connection between cellular metabolism and the epigenetic control of gene expression.

### The Metabolic Toolkit of the Immune Cell

Immune cells, like all cells, rely on a conserved set of [metabolic pathways](@entry_id:139344) to generate energy, synthesize biomass, and maintain [redox homeostasis](@entry_id:163390). However, the degree to which each pathway is utilized is dynamically regulated to meet the specific demands of [immune activation](@entry_id:203456), differentiation, and function. Understanding these core pathways is the first step toward appreciating the logic of [immunometabolism](@entry_id:155926). The seven major pathways are summarized below [@problem_id:2808678].

**Glycolysis** is a cytosolic pathway that catabolizes one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This process generates a net of two molecules of adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$) through **[substrate-level phosphorylation](@entry_id:141112)** and produces two molecules of the reducing equivalent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($NADH$). The committed and principal [rate-limiting step](@entry_id:150742) of glycolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme **[phosphofructokinase-1](@entry_id:143155) (PFK-1)**. Glycolysis serves as a rapid source of $ATP$ and provides crucial metabolic intermediates for other pathways.

The **Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP)** is a cytosolic pathway that branches from glycolysis at the level of glucose-6-phosphate. Its primary functions are anabolic and protective. The rate-limiting enzyme, **[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase](@entry_id:171482) (G6PD)**, initiates the oxidative branch, which produces the five-carbon sugar **[ribose-5-phosphate](@entry_id:173590)**—an essential precursor for [nucleotide synthesis](@entry_id:178562)—and the reducing equivalent **nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)**. NADPH is the principal reductant for biosynthetic reactions, such as [fatty acid synthesis](@entry_id:171770), and for [antioxidant defense](@entry_id:148909) systems that combat reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The **Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle**, also known as the Krebs cycle, occurs in the **mitochondrial matrix**. It is the central hub of [cellular metabolism](@entry_id:144671), oxidizing **acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)**, which is derived from [pyruvate](@entry_id:146431) (via the [pyruvate dehydrogenase complex](@entry_id:150942)), [fatty acids](@entry_id:145414), or amino acids. For each acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle, the outputs are carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), three molecules of $NADH$, one molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide ($FADH_2$), and one molecule of [guanosine triphosphate](@entry_id:177590) ($GTP$, an energetic equivalent of $ATP$). A key regulatory point is the enzyme **isocitrate [dehydrogenase](@entry_id:185854) (IDH)**. The TCA cycle not only generates the majority of the cell's reducing equivalents but also provides precursors for biosynthesis, a process known as **[anaplerosis](@entry_id:153445)** when intermediates are replenished, and **[cataplerosis](@entry_id:150753)** when they are withdrawn.

**Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS)** is the process by which the energy stored in $NADH$ and $FADH_2$ is converted into $ATP$. It takes place on the **[inner mitochondrial membrane](@entry_id:175557)**, which houses the **electron transport chain (ETC)**. $NADH$ and $FADH_2$ donate electrons to the ETC, which are passed through a series of [protein complexes](@entry_id:269238) (Complexes I-IV) to the [terminal electron acceptor](@entry_id:151870), molecular oxygen ($O_2$), forming water ($H_2O$). This electron flow pumps protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space, generating a **proton motive force**. The flow of protons back into the matrix through the **$F_1F_0$-ATP synthase** (Complex V) drives the synthesis of large quantities of $ATP$ from [adenosine](@entry_id:186491) diphosphate ($ADP$) and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$). OXPHOS is the most efficient pathway for $ATP$ production.

**Fatty Acid Synthesis (FAS)** is a cytosolic anabolic process that builds [fatty acids](@entry_id:145414), primarily the 16-carbon saturated [fatty acid](@entry_id:153334) palmitate. The building block is cytosolic acetyl-CoA, which is typically generated from mitochondrial citrate exported to the cytosol and then cleaved by the enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). The synthesis requires significant inputs of both $ATP$ and the NADPH provided by the PPP. The rate-limiting enzyme is **acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)**, which converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the substrate for the **[fatty acid synthase](@entry_id:177530) (FASN)** complex.

**Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO)**, also known as $\beta$-oxidation, is the catabolic process of breaking down fatty acids to produce energy. Long-chain fatty acids are first activated and then imported into the mitochondrial matrix via the **[carnitine palmitoyltransferase](@entry_id:163453) 1 (CPT1)** shuttle, which represents the key control point of the pathway. Inside the matrix, fatty acids are sequentially cleaved to produce acetyl-CoA, $NADH$, and $FADH_2$. These products then directly fuel the TCA cycle and OXPHOS, making FAO a highly efficient, oxygen-dependent pathway for generating $ATP$.

**Glutaminolysis** is a catabolic pathway that utilizes the amino acid glutamine. The enzyme **glutaminase (GLS)**, predominantly located in the mitochondria, converts glutamine to glutamate. Glutamate can then be further converted to the TCA cycle intermediate **$\alpha$-ketoglutarate ($\alpha$-KG)**. This process is a major anaplerotic pathway, meaning it replenishes TCA cycle intermediates that may have been withdrawn for [biosynthesis](@entry_id:174272). It is thus critical for maintaining TCA cycle function in highly proliferative cells.

### The Central Trade-Off: Rate vs. Yield and the Logic of Aerobic Glycolysis

A central paradox in [immunometabolism](@entry_id:155926) is why rapidly proliferating cells, such as activated T lymphocytes, preferentially engage in **[aerobic glycolysis](@entry_id:155064)**—a state of high glycolytic flux and lactate secretion, even in the presence of ample oxygen. This phenomenon, first observed in cancer cells by Otto Warburg, appears energetically wasteful, as it forgoes the much larger ATP yield of OXPHOS. However, this metabolic choice is driven by a compelling logic rooted in the fundamental constraints of rapid cell growth [@problem_id:2808674].

First, cellular proliferation is limited by the **rate of ATP production**, not just the efficiency of substrate use. While OXPHOS yields approximately 30 molecules of $ATP$ per glucose, it is a complex process constrained by mitochondrial surface area and the finite capacity of ETC components. In contrast, the enzymes of cytosolic glycolysis can be massively upregulated to achieve an extremely high flux. Consequently, the rate of ATP generation ($\text{moles of ATP} \cdot \text{time}^{-1}$) via glycolysis can exceed the maximum rate achievable by a saturated OXPHOS system. For a T cell needing to double its mass and divide every few hours, the speed of energy delivery is paramount.

Second, a high glycolytic rate presents a **[redox](@entry_id:138446) challenge**. The [glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase](@entry_id:174304) (GAPDH) step requires a continuous supply of oxidized $NAD^{+}$. The $NADH$ produced must be re-oxidized to $NAD^{+}$ to sustain flux. While mitochondrial shuttles can transport these reducing equivalents to the ETC, their capacity is limited. At high glycolytic rates, these shuttles become a bottleneck. The conversion of pyruvate to lactate, catalyzed by **[lactate dehydrogenase](@entry_id:166273) (LDH)**, provides a rapid, high-capacity cytosolic mechanism to regenerate $NAD^{+}$ from $NADH$, thereby uncoupling glycolytic rate from mitochondrial capacity and preventing a [redox](@entry_id:138446)-induced stall in the pathway.

Third, rapid proliferation demands a massive supply of **biosynthetic precursors**. A cell is more than just $ATP$; it is built of nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. High glycolytic flux is essential for shunting glucose-derived carbons into anabolic branch pathways. As discussed, the PPP diverts glucose-6-phosphate to produce ribose for nucleotides and NADPH for [lipid synthesis](@entry_id:165832). Furthermore, the TCA cycle is repurposed into an anabolic hub. Citrate is exported from the mitochondria to provide the carbon backbone for [fatty acid synthesis](@entry_id:171770). To sustain this withdrawal of intermediates, the cycle must be replenished via [anaplerosis](@entry_id:153445), primarily from glutamine. In this context, [aerobic glycolysis](@entry_id:155064) allows the cell to process a large volume of glucose, feeding [biosynthetic pathways](@entry_id:176750) while the "excess" pyruvate, not needed for the anabolic TCA cycle, is converted to lactate. This strategy effectively prioritizes [biosynthesis](@entry_id:174272) and rapid ATP generation over maximal energy extraction from each glucose molecule.

### Metabolic Reprogramming: Sensing the Environment to Fuel a Response

Immune cells do not operate in a static metabolic state. They must constantly sense and integrate environmental cues—such as growth factors, nutrient availability, and oxygen levels—to mount an appropriate metabolic response. This reprogramming is orchestrated by a sophisticated network of [signaling pathways](@entry_id:275545).

#### The mTOR Pathway: The Master Growth Controller

The **mechanistic target of [rapamycin](@entry_id:198475) (mTOR)** is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a central node for regulating cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. It exists in two distinct [protein complexes](@entry_id:269238), **mTORC1** and **mTORC2**, each with unique compositions, regulatory inputs, and downstream targets [@problem_id:2808648].

**mTORC1** is the primary driver of anabolic metabolism. It is defined by its core scaffold protein, **regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor)**. mTORC1 acts as a [coincidence detector](@entry_id:169622), integrating signals of growth factor availability and nutrient sufficiency. Growth factor signaling, for example from the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28, activates the PI3K-Akt pathway, which inhibits the **tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2)**. Inhibition of the TSC complex allows the small GTPase **Rheb** to accumulate in its active, GTP-bound state on the surface of [lysosomes](@entry_id:168205). In parallel, mTORC1 senses amino acid sufficiency, which directs its recruitment to the lysosomal surface. Only when both signals are present—Rheb-GTP on the [lysosome](@entry_id:174899) and mTORC1 recruited to the [lysosome](@entry_id:174899)—can mTORC1 become fully activated. Downstream, active mTORC1 phosphorylates targets like **S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)** and **4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1)** to promote [protein translation](@entry_id:203248). It also powerfully drives the glycolytic and anabolic phenotype by upregulating the expression of **[hypoxia](@entry_id:153785)-inducible factor-1$\alpha$ (HIF-1$\alpha$)** and c-Myc, and by activating **[sterol](@entry_id:173187) regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)** to promote [lipid synthesis](@entry_id:165832).

**mTORC2**, defined by its scaffold protein **[rapamycin](@entry_id:198475)-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor)**, functions primarily as part of the [growth factor](@entry_id:634572) [signaling cascade](@entry_id:175148). It is activated downstream of PI3K signaling at the plasma membrane and is a key upstream kinase for the full activation of Akt. By phosphorylating Akt at a critical residue (Serine 473), mTORC2 enhances cell survival, glucose uptake, and cytoskeletal organization, all of which are essential for immune cell function.

#### Amino Acid Sensing: A Closer Look at mTORC1 Gating

The requirement for amino acid sufficiency to activate mTORC1 provides a critical checkpoint, ensuring that cells only commit to anabolic growth when the necessary building blocks are available. The sensing mechanism is exquisitely complex and provides a beautiful example of spatial regulation in signaling [@problem_id:2808701]. The **Rag GTPases** act as the direct recruiters of mTORC1 to the lysosome. They function as heterodimers (e.g., RagA/B with RagC/D). For mTORC1 recruitment to occur, RagA/B must be in a GTP-bound state and RagC/D in a GDP-[bound state](@entry_id:136872). The nucleotide status of RagA/B is controlled by a balance of GEF (guanine [nucleotide exchange factor](@entry_id:199424)) and GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity.

Specifically, cytosolic sensors detect the levels of key amino acids. **Sestrin2** binds to leucine, and **CASTOR1** binds to arginine. In the absence of their respective amino acids, these sensors bind to and activate the **GATOR2** complex, which in turn inhibits the **GATOR1** complex. GATOR1 is a GAP for RagA/B. Therefore, amino acid scarcity leads to active GATOR1, which keeps RagA/B in an inactive, GDP-bound state, preventing mTORC1 recruitment. When leucine and arginine are plentiful, they bind Sestrin2 and CASTOR1, respectively, relieving the inhibition on GATOR1 and allowing RagA/B to become GTP-loaded. This complex mechanism effectively functions as an **AND gate**: full mTORC1 activation requires the simultaneous input of growth factors (to activate Rheb) AND sufficient amino acids (to recruit mTORC1 to Rheb).

#### The AMPK Pathway: The Guardian of Cellular Energy

As a counterbalance to the growth-promoting mTOR pathway, **AMP-activated [protein kinase](@entry_id:146851) (AMPK)** functions as the cell's primary energy sensor, orchestrating a switch from anabolism to [catabolism](@entry_id:141081) during times of energy stress [@problem_id:2808680]. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic $\alpha$ subunit, a scaffolding $\beta$ subunit, and a regulatory $\gamma$ subunit. The $\gamma$ subunit contains binding sites that competitively bind ATP, ADP, and AMP.

When cellular energy charge is low—indicated by rising ratios of AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP—AMP and ADP bind to the $\gamma$ subunit. This triggers a multi-pronged activation of AMPK: it causes a direct allosteric activation of the kinase, promotes its activating phosphorylation on Threonine-172 of the $\alpha$ subunit by upstream kinases like **LKB1**, and protects this phosphorylation site from being dephosphorylated. Activated AMPK then works to restore [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) by phosphorylating key metabolic enzymes. It inhibits anabolic processes by directly phosphorylating Raptor to inhibit mTORC1 and by activating TSC2 to further suppress Rheb. Concurrently, it promotes catabolism by phosphorylating and inhibiting ACC, the rate-limiting enzyme for [fatty acid synthesis](@entry_id:171770). Inhibiting ACC lowers the level of its product, malonyl-CoA, which in turn relieves the inhibition on CPT1, thereby unleashing [fatty acid oxidation](@entry_id:153280) to generate ATP.

#### The HIF-1$\alpha$ Pathway: Responding to Hypoxia and Metabolic Stress

**Hypoxia-inducible factor-1$\alpha$ (HIF-1$\alpha$)** is a master transcriptional regulator that is pivotal in driving the switch to glycolysis. Under normal oxygen conditions (normoxia), HIF-1$\alpha$ is continuously synthesized but immediately targeted for degradation. This process is mediated by **[prolyl hydroxylase](@entry_id:164417) domain (PHD)** enzymes. PHDs are dioxygenases that use molecular oxygen ($O_2$), iron ($Fe^{2+}$), and the metabolite **$\alpha$-ketoglutarate ($\alpha$-KG)** as co-substrates to hydroxylate specific [proline](@entry_id:166601) residues on HIF-1$\alpha$. This hydroxylation creates a binding site for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) [ligase](@entry_id:139297), leading to HIF-1$\alpha$'s proteasomal destruction [@problem_id:2808716].

PHD activity can be inhibited in two major ways, both of which lead to the stabilization and activation of HIF-1$\alpha$. The first is **[hypoxia](@entry_id:153785)**, or low oxygen. As $O_2$ is a required substrate, its scarcity directly reduces PHD enzyme velocity. The second, and profoundly important for [immunometabolism](@entry_id:155926), is **metabolic inhibition**. Succinate, the product of the PHD reaction, is also a competitive inhibitor with respect to the co-substrate $\alpha$-KG. Therefore, an accumulation of intracellular succinate can potently inhibit PHD activity even in the presence of oxygen (a phenomenon called **pseudohypoxia**). Once stabilized, HIF-1$\alpha$ translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes with HIF-1$\beta$, and drives the transcription of a battery of genes that enforce a glycolytic and pro-inflammatory phenotype. Key targets include the glucose transporter *SLC2A1* (GLUT1), glycolytic enzymes like *PDK1* and *LDHA*, and potent [inflammatory mediators](@entry_id:194567) such as *IL1B* (Interleukin-1$\beta$).

### Metabolic Phenotypes of Immune Cells: Function Dictates Fuel

The [signaling pathways](@entry_id:275545) described above allow different immune cells to adopt distinct metabolic profiles that are precisely tailored to their specific functions.

#### Macrophage Polarization: The M1/M2 Dichotomy

Macrophages exhibit remarkable plasticity, adopting different phenotypes in response to environmental cues. The two extremes of this spectrum are the classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, which have starkly contrasting metabolic programs [@problem_id:2808690].

**M1 [macrophages](@entry_id:172082)**, polarized by stimuli like [lipopolysaccharide](@entry_id:188695) (LPS) and interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$), are pro-inflammatory and microbicidal. Their function requires rapid production of [inflammatory mediators](@entry_id:194567) and reactive molecules. To support this, M1 cells engage in **[aerobic glycolysis](@entry_id:155064)**. They exhibit a high extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) due to lactate production and a suppressed oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Their TCA cycle is intentionally "broken" at two key points. An early break after citrate allows for the accumulation and export of citrate for purposes such as the production of **itaconate**, an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory metabolite. A second break occurs at [succinate dehydrogenase](@entry_id:148474) (SDH), which is inhibited by itaconate. This leads to the massive accumulation of **succinate**, which, as discussed, stabilizes HIF-1$\alpha$ and reinforces the glycolytic, pro-inflammatory state. Furthermore, M1 cells produce high levels of nitric oxide (NO), which inhibits ETC Complex IV, further suppressing OXPHOS.

**M2 [macrophages](@entry_id:172082)**, polarized by [cytokines](@entry_id:156485) like interleukin-4 (IL-4), are involved in anti-inflammatory responses and [tissue repair](@entry_id:189995). These are long-term functions that require sustained and efficient energy production. Accordingly, M2 cells rely on an intact, fully functional TCA cycle fueled primarily by **[fatty acid oxidation](@entry_id:153280)**. They exhibit a high OCR, indicating robust OXPHOS, and have a high spare respiratory capacity, reflecting healthy and abundant mitochondria. Their metabolism is sensitive to FAO inhibitors like etomoxir but resistant to glycolysis inhibitors. This oxidative state maintains a high ratio of $\alpha$-KG to succinate, which has important epigenetic consequences for promoting the M2 gene expression program.

#### T Cell Differentiation: A Spectrum of Metabolic States

Similar to [macrophages](@entry_id:172082), T [lymphocytes](@entry_id:185166) adopt diverse metabolic programs depending on their lineage and functional status [@problem_id:2808652].

**Effector T cells (Teff)**, such as Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, which are responsible for clearing pathogens, must undergo massive [clonal expansion](@entry_id:194125) and produce large quantities of cytokines. They are therefore highly anabolic and mirror the M1 macrophage phenotype by engaging in [aerobic glycolysis](@entry_id:155064), glutaminolysis, and de novo [lipid synthesis](@entry_id:165832). Inhibition of glycolysis severely cripples the function of pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells. Th17 cells, in particular, are exquisitely dependent on all three of these anabolic pathways, highlighting their high metabolic activity.

In stark contrast, **longevity-oriented T cells**, namely **memory T cells (Tmem)** and **regulatory T cells (Treg)**, prioritize survival, efficiency, and sustained function over rapid growth [@problem_id:2808722]. Both lineages rely on catabolic pathways like FAO coupled to OXPHOS. This efficient metabolism allows them to persist for long periods, often in nutrient-poor peripheral tissues. A key feature of Tmem cells is their high **spare respiratory capacity (SRC)**, which is the difference between their maximal and basal respiration rate. This high SRC indicates a state of mitochondrial fitness, allowing them to operate at a low basal level (minimizing ROS production and cumulative damage) while retaining the capacity to rapidly ramp up energy production upon secondary antigen encounter [@problem_id:2808654]. Tregs also utilize an [oxidative metabolism](@entry_id:151256) to support their sustained suppressive function, a state promoted by AMPK signaling.

Other T cell subsets exhibit unique metabolic dependencies. For example, **T follicular helper (Tfh) cells**, which are crucial for germinal center responses, show relatively low glycolytic activity but have a distinct requirement for the [cholesterol biosynthesis](@entry_id:167854) pathway for their differentiation and function [@problem_id:2808652].

### The Metabolic-Epigenetic Axis: Metabolites as Signaling Molecules

Perhaps the most profound insight in modern [immunometabolism](@entry_id:155926) is the realization that metabolites are not merely fuel sources or building blocks, but also act as critical co-substrates and inhibitors for the enzymes that regulate the epigenome. This creates a direct feedback loop where the metabolic state of a cell directly shapes its gene expression programs by altering the chromatin landscape [@problem_id:2808677].

The activity of **[histone](@entry_id:177488) acetyltransferases (HATs)**, which place activating acetyl marks on [histones](@entry_id:164675), is directly dependent on the availability of their sole substrate, **acetyl-CoA**. The nucleocytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA is primarily generated by ACLY from mitochondrially-derived citrate. Thus, pathways that control citrate and ACLY activity directly influence [histone acetylation](@entry_id:152527) and gene activation.

Similarly, the activity of [histone](@entry_id:177488) and DNA methyltransferases depends on the availability of the universal methyl donor, **S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)**. The ratio of SAM to its byproduct, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), sets the "methylation potential" of the cell.

Conversely, the removal of methyl marks from [histones](@entry_id:164675) and DNA is often catalyzed by **$\alpha$-KG-dependent dioxygenases**, which include the **JmjC-domain histone demethylases** and the **TET DNA demethylases**. The activity of these enzymes is directly proportional to the intracellular concentration of their co-substrate, **$\alpha$-KG**. Therefore, pathways that generate $\alpha$-KG, such as glutaminolysis, promote active demethylation.

Crucially, these dioxygenases can be competitively inhibited by metabolites that are structurally similar to $\alpha$-KG. As we have seen, the [oncometabolite](@entry_id:166955) **2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)**, produced by mutant IDH enzymes, and the TCA cycle intermediates **succinate** and **fumarate** are all potent inhibitors of TET and JmjC enzymes. The accumulation of these metabolites, as seen in M1 macrophages or certain cancers, leads to widespread DNA and [histone](@entry_id:177488) hypermethylation, profoundly altering cell fate and function. This metabolic-epigenetic axis represents a fundamental mechanism by which a cell's metabolic environment is translated into a durable cellular identity.
