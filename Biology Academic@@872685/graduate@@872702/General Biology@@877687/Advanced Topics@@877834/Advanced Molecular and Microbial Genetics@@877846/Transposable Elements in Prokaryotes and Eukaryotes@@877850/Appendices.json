By definition of LTR retrotransposon biology, the two flanking Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) sequences are synthesized by reverse transcription as identical copies at the moment of insertion. After insertion, the two LTRs diverge independently under mutation and drift. A carefully curated pairwise alignment of the two LTRs is constructed as follows: to minimize context-dependent rate heterogeneity, all positions that are or were part of cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) dinucleotides are masked, and only the remaining non-CpG sites are retained. The resulting alignment length is $L = 3600$ sites, with $N_{\\mathrm{ts}} = 81$ observed transitions and $N_{\\mathrm{tv}} = 27$ observed transversions between the two LTRs.\n\nAssume the following well-tested facts and definitions:\n- By the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the neutral substitution rate per site per generation equals the neutral mutation rate per site per generation. If the generation time is $g$ years, the neutral substitution rate per site per year is $r = f u / g$, where $u$ is the mutation rate per site per generation and $f$ is the fraction of mutations that are effectively neutral at the analyzed sites.\n- For two independently evolving sequences that were identical at time of insertion, the expected number of substitutions per site separating them (the evolutionary distance) accumulates at rate $2 r$ under stationarity and time-homogeneous conditions.\n- Under the Kimura two-parameter (K80) model, transitions and transversions occur as independent Poisson processes with distinct rates, and multiple hits at the same site are possible.\n\nUse the Kimura two-parameter framework to correct for multiple hits based on the observed transition and transversion fractions, and then estimate the time since insertion.

It is a standard, solvable problem in theoretical population genetics. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles by constructing a recurrence relation for the frequency of the insertion allele, $a$, from one generation to the next. Let $p_t$ be the frequency of allele $a$ at the start of generation $t$ (before selection). The frequency of allele $A$ is thus $1 - p_t$.\n\nThe life cycle consists of two sequential steps: selection and mutation.\n\n**1. Viability Selection:**\nThe fitness of allele $A$ is $w_A = 1$, and the fitness of allele $a$ is $w_a = 1 - s$. The mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the average of the allele fitness values weighted by their frequencies:\n$$ \\bar{w} = (1 - p_t)w_A + p_t w_a $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = (1 - p_t)(1) + p_t(1 - s) = 1 - p_t + p_t - sp_t = 1 - sp_t $$\nAfter selection, the frequency of allele $a$, denoted $p_s$, is its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness:\n$$ p_s = \\frac{p_t w_a}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p_t(1 - s)}{1 - sp_t} $$\nThe frequency of allele $A$ after selection is correspondingly:\n$$ 1 - p_s = \\frac{(1 - p_t)w_A}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{1 - p_t}{1 - sp_t} $$\n\n**2. Reversible Mutation:**\nFollowing selection, mutation occurs. Allele $A$ mutates to $a$ at a rate $u$, and allele $a$ mutates to $A$ at a rate $e$. The frequency of allele $a$ at the start of the next generation, $p_{t+1}$, is determined by the frequencies after selection ($p_s$ and $1 - p_s$). Allele $a$ is constituted by the fraction of $a$ alleles that do not mutate away ($1-e$) and the fraction of $A$ alleles that mutate into $a$ ($u$).\n$$ p_{t+1} = p_s(1 - e) + (1 - p_s)u $$\n$$ p_{t+1} = p_s - ep_s + u - up_s = p_s(1 - e - u) + u $$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_s$:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\left(\\frac{p_t(1 - s)}{1 - sp_t}\\right)(1 - e - u) + u $$\nThis equation is the complete recurrence relation for the frequency of allele $a$.\n\n**3.

It describes a classic scenario of competition for a shared resource, in this case, the host's limited capacity for TE activity, which is regulated by a finite pool of silencing complexes. We will proceed with a deterministic analysis based on mass-action principles.\n\nFirst, we derive the continuous-time deterministic equations for the expected copy numbers, $n_A(t)$ and $n_B(t)$. The rate of change for the copy number of family $i$, where $i \\in \\{A, B\\}$, is given by the total rate of copy generation (birth) minus the total rate of copy loss (death).\n\nThe total birth rate for family $i$ is the product of the number of copies, $n_i$, the baseline per-copy transposition rate, $\\mu_i$, and the repression factor, $S(n)$. The repression factor $S(n) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\kappa n}$ depends on the total copy number $n = n_A + n_B$. Thus, the total birth rate is $n_i \\mu_i S(n) = \\frac{n_i \\mu_i}{1 + \\kappa(n_A + n_B)}$.\n\nThe total death rate for family $i$ is the product of the number of copies, $n_i$, and the per-copy loss rate, $\\delta_i$. This gives a total death rate of $n_i \\delta_i$.\n\nCombining the birth and death rates, the dynamical equation for the copy number of family $i$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\text{Births} - \\text{Deaths} = \\frac{n_i \\mu_i}{1 + \\kappa(n_A + n_B)} - n_i \\delta_i\n$$\nWe can factor out $n_i$ to express this in terms of the per-capita growth rate:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = n_i \\left( \\frac{\\mu_i}{1 + \\kappa(n_A + n_B)} - \\delta_i \\right)\n$$\nThis gives us the system of two coupled ordinary differential equations for $n_A(t)$ and $n_B(t)$.\n\nAt a steady state, by definition, $\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = 0$ for all families $i$. For any family $i$ that persists at a non-zero copy number (i.e., $n_i^* > 0$, where the asterisk denotes a steady-state value), its per-capita growth rate must be zero.

For coexistence to occur, we must have both $n_A^* > 0$ and $n_B^* > 0$. If this is the case, the steady-state condition must hold for both families simultaneously:\n$$\n1 + \\kappa n^* = \\frac{\\mu_A}{\\delta_A} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1 + \\kappa n^* = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\delta_B}\n$$\nThis implies that we must have $\\frac{\\mu_A}{\\delta_A} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\delta_B}$.

Coexistence is only possible under the non-generic condition that both families have exactly the same intrinsic reproductive number. For any generic set of parameters where $R_A \\neq R_B$, coexistence is not possible. This is an instance of the principle of competitive exclusion.\n\nThe family that persists is the one that can survive under the strongest repression. The steady-state condition can be written as $S(n^*) = \\delta_i / \\mu_i = 1/R_i$. The system will stabilize at a total copy number $n^*$ that satisfies the zero-growth condition for one of the families. The competitor that can tolerate the lowest value of $S(n^*)$ (i.e., the highest level of repression) will win. A lower value of $S(n^*) = 1/R_i$ corresponds to a higher value of $R_i$. Therefore, the family with the higher intrinsic reproductive number $R_i = \\mu_i/\\delta_i$ will outcompete and exclude the other.\nAssuming $\\mu_i > \\delta_i$ (or $R_i > 1$) for at least one family, the winning family, which we denote with subscript $W$, is the one for which $R_W = \\max(R_A, R_B)$.

Family B will be eliminated from the genome. The steady state will consist only of family A copies.\n\nThe total steady-state copy number $n^*$ is found using the parameters for family A:\n$$\nn^* = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_A}{\\delta_A} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{0.035} (10 - 1) = \\frac{9}{0.035}\n$$\n$$\nn^* = \\frac{9000}{35} = \\frac{1800}{7} \\approx 257.1428...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
