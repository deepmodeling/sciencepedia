While these matings are noted for efficiently transferring chromosomal genes, the recipient cell rarely becomes a donor itself. This practice problem [@problem_id:2071003] challenges you to explain this classic observation by analyzing the mechanics of DNA transfer from an integrated F factor.", "problem": "In a microbiology laboratory, a conjugation experiment is conducted using a High-frequency of recombination (Hfr) strain of *Escherichia coli* as the donor and an F⁻ strain as the recipient. In an Hfr cell, the F (fertility) factor plasmid has integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Conjugation is initiated, and DNA transfer proceeds from the donor to the recipient. The process is allowed to run for a standard duration (e.g., 30 minutes) before the mating pairs are mechanically disrupted. Subsequent analysis reveals that while many recipient cells have incorporated new chromosomal genes from the donor, very few of them have been converted into F⁺ or Hfr cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains this observation?\n\nA. The F⁻ recipient cells possess specialized restriction enzymes that specifically target and degrade the F factor DNA upon entry, while leaving chromosomal DNA intact.\n\nB. The Hfr donor cell is programmed to die after transferring its chromosomal DNA, a process which occurs before the F factor itself can be transferred.\n\nC. The F factor is integrated in such a way that the entire donor chromosome must be transferred to the recipient for a complete F factor to be received, an event which is rarely completed due to the physical instability of the mating connection.\n\nD. The F factor in Hfr cells is a defective version that lacks the genes necessary for replication, so even if transferred, it cannot establish itself in the recipient cell.\n\nE. During Hfr conjugation, only chromosomal DNA is transferred; the integrated F factor is excised from the chromosome just before transfer begins and is retained by the donor cell.", "solution": "To determine the correct explanation, we must analyze the mechanism of conjugation involving an Hfr donor and an F- recipient.\n\n1.  **State of the F factor in an Hfr cell:** In an Hfr strain, the F factor is not an independent plasmid. Instead, it has integrated itself into the host's circular chromosome. The point of integration is specific for a given Hfr strain, but the orientation can vary.\n\n2.  **Initiation of DNA Transfer:** Conjugation begins when a protein complex nicks one strand of the DNA at a specific site within the integrated F factor called the origin of transfer, or `oriT`. This nicked strand begins to unwind and is transferred linearly into the F- recipient cell.\n\n3.  **The Order of Transfer:** Because the transfer starts from `oriT` within the integrated F factor, the sequence of DNA transferred is as follows: first, a portion of the F factor DNA enters the recipient, followed by the donor's chromosomal genes in a linear sequence, and finally, the remaining portion of the F factor DNA is transferred last. To receive the complete F factor, the F- cell must receive the entire, unbroken strand of the donor's chromosome plus the initial part of the F factor.\n\n4.  **The Limiting Factor - Time and Stability:** The transfer of the entire *E. coli* chromosome takes approximately 100 minutes under ideal conditions. However, the physical connection between the donor and recipient, known as the conjugation pilus or mating bridge, is fragile. Random thermal motion, fluid shear, and other physical disturbances typically cause this bridge to break long before the 100-minute mark. In a typical experiment, mating is deliberately stopped after a much shorter time (e.g., 30 minutes) to map gene locations.\n\n5.  **Outcome for the Recipient Cell:** Due to the premature breakage of the mating bridge, the recipient cell usually receives the initial part of the F factor and a segment of the donor's chromosomal DNA, but not the final segment of the F factor. For a cell to become F+ (with a free F plasmid) or Hfr (with an integrated F factor), it must possess the *entire* F factor genetic sequence. Since the recipient rarely receives the complete sequence, it remains F-. However, the chromosomal genes that were successfully transferred can be incorporated into the recipient's chromosome via homologous recombination, making the recipient a recombinant F- cell. This is why Hfr strains are named for \"High-frequency of recombination\" of chromosomal genes, not for high-frequency conversion of F- cells to F+.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\n\n*   **A:** Incorrect. While cells have restriction-modification systems, there isn't one that specifically targets only F factor DNA while ignoring chromosomal DNA from the same donor. The F- cell is, by definition, receptive to conjugation.\n*   **B:** Incorrect. The donor Hfr cell does not die as a result of conjugation. It retains a copy of its chromosome and continues to live and replicate. The process is not suicidal for the donor.\n*   **C:** Correct. This statement accurately describes the core reason. The F factor is split during transfer, with one part leading and the other part trailing the entire chromosome. Transfer of the entire chromosome is required to transfer the full F factor, and this process is almost always interrupted by the breaking of the physical mating connection.\n*   **D:** Incorrect. The F factor in an Hfr cell is fully functional. If it were to be excised cleanly from the chromosome (a process that creates an F' plasmid), it could replicate independently. The issue is not the viability of the F factor's genes but the incompleteness of its transfer.\n*   **E:** Incorrect. This misrepresents the process. The integrated F factor is the engine driving the transfer and is part of the DNA that is transferred. It is not excised and retained. The process that involves excision of the F factor leads to the formation of F' (F-prime) cells, which is a different phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that the physical connection is too unstable to allow for the transfer of the entire chromosome, which is a prerequisite for transferring the complete F factor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2071003"}, {"introduction": "The defining application of Hfr strains is the mapping of bacterial chromosomes.

Transfer initiates at a single origin of transfer (oriT) and proceeds unidirectionally into the chromosome at approximately constant speed. In interrupted-mating time-of-entry mapping, the earliest time at which a chromosomal marker is recovered in recombinants is proportional to its linear distance from oriT along the direction of transfer. The canonical Escherichia coli linkage map uses minutes as a unit proportional to transfer time under a fixed transfer velocity, so that equal time differences correspond to equal map distances in minutes.\n\nAn Hfr strain is used in an interrupted-mating series, with transfer initiated at time $t=0$ at oriT. The earliest reproducible entry times (first appearance in recombinants) for three markers are observed as follows: galactose utilization ($\\mathrm{gal}$) at $8$ minutes, biotin synthesis ($\\mathrm{bio}$) at $16$ minutes, and methionine synthesis ($\\mathrm{met}$) at $25$ minutes. Assume a single oriT, unidirectional transfer without reversal, constant transfer speed, and that all three markers lie on the same side of oriT within the transferred segment (i.e., no wrap-around across the chromosomal completion point is involved).\n\nBased only on these time-of-entry data and the assumptions above:\n- Infer the linear order of the markers relative to oriT along the transfer path.\n- Compute the relative map distances in minutes between consecutive features along the transfer path starting at oriT.\n\nReport only the three inter-feature distances, in order, as a row matrix $\\left(d_{\\mathrm{oriT}\\to 1},\\,d_{1\\to 2},\\,d_{2\\to 3}\\right)$, where $1$, $2$, and $3$ denote the first, second, and third markers encountered from oriT along the transfer direction.

The problem has been validated and is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle of time-of-entry mapping, as stated in the problem, is that the map distance of a gene from the origin of transfer, $\\mathrm{oriT}$, is directly proportional to its time of entry. The problem specifies that the map unit is minutes, which simplifies this relationship to a direct equality: the map distance from $\\mathrm{oriT}$ to a marker is numerically equal to the marker's time of entry.\n\nLet $t_{marker}$ denote the time of entry for a specific marker, and let $d_{\\mathrm{oriT} \\to marker}$ be the corresponding map distance from $\\mathrm{oriT}$. The governing relationship is:\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{oriT} \\to marker} = t_{marker}\n$$\nThe provided entry times are:\n-   For the galactose utilization marker ($\\mathrm{gal}$): $t_{\\mathrm{gal}} = 8$ minutes.\n-   For the biotin synthesis marker ($\\mathrm{bio}$): $t_{\\mathrm{bio}} = 16$ minutes.\n-   For the methionine synthesis marker ($\\mathrm{met}$): $t_{\\mathrm{met}} = 25$ minutes.\n\nThe problem assumptions state that transfer is unidirectional from a single $\\mathrm{oriT}$ and all three markers lie on the same side of the origin.
