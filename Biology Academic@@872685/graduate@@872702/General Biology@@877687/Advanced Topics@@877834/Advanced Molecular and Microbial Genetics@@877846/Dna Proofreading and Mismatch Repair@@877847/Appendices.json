This first practice problem employs a classic genetic thought experiment involving a temperature-sensitive mutation to functionally remove a single enzyme, DNA ligase, from the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway in *Escherichia coli*. By predicting the state of the DNA after the rest of the repair system has acted, you will reinforce your understanding of the precise sequence of events—from recognition to ligation—that defines this critical fidelity mechanism [@problem_id:2313125].", "problem": "A researcher is studying a specific strain of *Escherichia coli* that possesses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding DNA ligase. When this strain is grown at a non-permissive temperature, the DNA ligase enzyme is rendered non-functional. However, all other components of the cell's DNA replication and mismatch repair (MMR) systems, including Dam methylase, the MutS, MutL, and MutH proteins, DNA Polymerase III, and relevant exonucleases, are fully functional.\n\nDuring DNA replication at this non-permissive temperature, a biosynthetic error leads to the incorporation of a thymine (T) opposite a guanine (G) on the parental strand, creating a G-T mismatch. The MMR system is subsequently activated to correct this error on the newly synthesized, unmethylated strand.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the DNA molecule at this specific locus after the MMR process has proceeded as far as it can under these conditions?\n\nA. The mismatch is corrected to a proper G-C pair, but a nick remains in the phosphodiester backbone of the repaired strand.\n\nB. The mismatch is excised by an exonuclease, but the resulting single-stranded gap is not filled in.\n\nC. The mismatch is recognized by the MutS protein, but the incorrect nucleotide is not removed from the newly synthesized strand.\n\nD. The mismatch remains completely uncorrected, as if the repair system never recognized it, and both DNA strands remain covalently intact.\n\nE. The repair system incorrectly alters the parental strand, changing the original guanine (G) to an adenine (A), thus permanently establishing a T-A pair in the genome.", "solution": "The bacterial mismatch repair pathway in Escherichia coli proceeds as follows on a hemimethylated duplex produced immediately after replication. First, the mismatch is recognized by MutS, which recruits MutL. MutL activates MutH, an endonuclease that incises the unmethylated daughter strand at a nearby hemimethylated GATC site, generating a nick that marks the daughter strand for repair. Helicase II (UvrD) unwinds from this nick past the mismatch, and an appropriate polarity exonuclease degrades the daughter-strand DNA segment containing the mismatch, producing a single-stranded gap that spans beyond the original G-T mispair. DNA Polymerase III then fills in this gap using the parental (methylated) strand as the template, thereby restoring correct Watson-Crick base pairing; specifically, the erroneous thymine on the daughter strand is replaced with cytosine to pair properly with the parental guanine, yielding a G-C pair. Under normal conditions, the final step is sealing of the remaining nick in the phosphodiester backbone by DNA ligase.\n\nIn the scenario given, the DNA ligase is non-functional at the non-permissive temperature, whereas MutS, MutL, MutH, Dam methylase, helicase, the relevant exonucleases, and DNA Polymerase III are fully functional. Therefore, all steps up to and including resynthesis by DNA Polymerase III proceed, correcting the mismatch on the unmethylated daughter strand. However, the final ligation step cannot occur, leaving a nick in the repaired strand.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states that the mismatch is corrected to G-C, but a nick remains due to inactive ligase.\n- B is incorrect because DNA Polymerase III is functional and fills the gap.\n- C is incorrect because the incorrect nucleotide is removed by the MutH/UvrD/exonuclease-mediated excision.\n- D is incorrect because the system recognizes and processes the mismatch.\n- E is incorrect because strand discrimination via hemimethylation targets the unmethylated daughter, not the parental strand.\n\nThus, the most accurate description is that the mismatch is corrected but a nick remains in the repaired strand.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2313125"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental challenge for mismatch repair is distinguishing the original template strand from the newly synthesized, and potentially erroneous, one. This problem delves into the elegant logic of strand discrimination in *E. coli*, which relies on patterns of DNA methylation. You are asked to consider a hypothetical scenario where this system is disrupted by a hyperactive methylase, forcing a deep consideration of how the repair machinery uses chemical tags to make the correct decision and avoid introducing permanent mutations [@problem_id:2313103].", "problem": "In *Escherichia coli*, the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system serves as a critical quality control mechanism, correcting base pair mismatches that are missed by the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase during replication. This system relies on a set of proteins, including MutS, MutL, and MutH, to identify and repair errors. Crucially, the system must be able to distinguish the newly synthesized (and potentially erroneous) strand from the original template strand. This discrimination is achieved through DNA methylation. The enzyme Dam methylase methylates the adenine base within GATC sequences. For a brief period following replication, the template strand is methylated while the newly synthesized strand is not, creating a \"hemimethylated\" state. The MutH protein recognizes these hemimethylated GATC sites and specifically nicks the unmethylated new strand, initiating the repair process.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant strain of *E. coli* that expresses a hyperactive form of the Dam methylase enzyme. This hyperactivity causes the enzyme to methylate the GATC sequences on the newly synthesized DNA strand almost instantaneously after its synthesis, thereby eliminating the transient hemimethylated state.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the most immediate and significant consequence for this mutant cell?\n\nA. The Mismatch Repair system would fail to initiate because MutS requires a hemimethylated GATC site to recognize the mismatch.\n\nB. The cell would become unable to repair DNA damage caused by external mutagens like ultraviolet light.\n\nC. The overall rate of DNA replication would significantly slow down because the replication machinery would stall at the now fully methylated GATC sites.\n\nD. The Mismatch Repair system would randomly correct either the template strand or the newly synthesized strand, causing approximately half of the replication errors to become permanent mutations.\n\nE. The proofreading (3'-5' exonuclease) activity of DNA polymerase would be directly inhibited by the aberrant methylation, leading to a massive increase in errors during initial DNA synthesis.", "solution": "The normal methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli proceeds as follows: MutS recognizes a mismatched base pair independently of methylation status, MutL couples MutS to the endonuclease MutH, and MutH identifies hemimethylated GATC sites to incise specifically the unmethylated, newly synthesized strand. The strand discrimination signal is the transient hemimethylated state produced because Dam methylase methylates the template strand before the nascent strand; only after a delay is the nascent strand methylated.\n\nIn the mutant with hyperactive Dam methylase, the nascent strand is methylated almost immediately, eliminating the hemimethylated window. Consequently, MutH cannot find hemimethylated GATC sites and therefore cannot direct a strand-specific nick. MutS can still bind mismatches and recruit MutL, but the critical strand discrimination step is lost. Without the methylation asymmetry, mismatch repair either fails to initiate excision or proceeds without directionality when incidental discontinuities are present, leading to random correction of one strand or the other. This loss of directionality means that, on average, approximately half of attempted repairs will remove the correct template base rather than the incorrect newly synthesized base, converting mismatches into permanent mutations, while the other half would correct the error.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because MutS does not require hemimethylation; the methylation signal is required by MutH for strand discrimination.\n- B is incorrect because repair of UV damage is primarily via nucleotide excision repair and is not directly dependent on Dam-mediated strand discrimination.\n- C is incorrect because DNA methylation at GATC sites does not cause replication stalling.\n- D correctly captures the immediate consequence: loss of strand discrimination in MMR leads to random correction, fixing approximately one-half of replication errors as mutations.\n- E is incorrect because DNA polymerase proofreading is independent of Dam methylation.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2313103"}, {"introduction": "In eukaryotes, DNA repair does not occur on naked DNA but within the complex and dynamic environment of chromatin. This exercise transitions to the eukaryotic context, asking you to apply quantitative reasoning to a biophysical model of DNA accessibility. By calculating how a nucleosome impacts the kinetics of mismatch repair, you will explore the crucial relationship between chromatin structure and the efficiency of maintaining genomic integrity, bridging the gap between biochemistry and the physical reality of the nucleus [@problem_id:2313118].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms can be significantly influenced by the local chromatin environment. Consider the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system, which corrects base-base mismatches that arise during DNA replication. We wish to model the difference in repair efficiency for a single G-T mismatch located in two distinct genomic contexts: (1) within the easily accessible linker DNA region connecting two nucleosomes, and (2) wrapped within a stable nucleosome core particle.\n\nWe can model the repair process using first-order kinetics. For a mismatch in the linker DNA, the site is always accessible, and the repair is limited by the intrinsic rate of the MMR machinery. For a mismatch within a nucleosome, the DNA must transiently unwrap from the histone octamer for the repair machinery to access the site. This unwrapping and re-wrapping process can be described by two rate constants: the rate of site exposure, $k_{open}$, and the rate of site concealment, $k_{close}$. Assume that once the site is exposed, the repair proceeds with the same intrinsic rate as in the linker DNA.\n\nBased on single-molecule biophysical experiments, the rate constants for a typical mismatch site within a nucleosome are determined to be $k_{open} = 0.22 \\text{ s}^{-1}$ and $k_{close} = 9.5 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the half-life of a mismatch within the nucleosome core particle ($t_{1/2, \\text{nuc}}$) to the half-life of a mismatch in the linker DNA ($t_{1/2, \\text{linker}}$).
