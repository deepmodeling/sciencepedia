In this context, the \"reaction\" is the successful transfer of a plasmid from a donor cell to a recipient cell, thereby creating a new transconjugant cell. Let $T$ represent the density of transconjugant cells (in cells $\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$). The problem asks for the instantaneous production rate of this density, which is mathematically expressed as the derivative $\\frac{dT}{dt}$.\n\nThe law of mass action states that the rate of a process involving two interacting entities is directly proportional to the product of their respective concentrations or densities. Here, the interacting entities are the donor cells and the recipient cells. The rate of encounters between donors and recipients in a well-mixed system is therefore proportional to the product of their densities, $D \\cdot R$.\n\nThe problem provides the proportionality constant, which it defines as the effective conjugation mass-action transfer coefficient, $\\beta$. This coefficient consolidates the probability of an encounter leading to a successful plasmid transfer into a single parameter.\n\nThus, the instantaneous production rate of transconjugant density, $\\frac{dT}{dt}$, is given by the product of the transfer coefficient and the densities of the two interacting populations:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\beta \\cdot D \\cdot R\n$$\nThis equation is the formal expression for the rate as a function of $D$, $R$, and $\\beta$.\n\nA dimensional analysis confirms the correctness of this expression.

The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and technical, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find an expression for the fractional reduction in transduction success, $R$, defined as:\n$$\nR = 1 - \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{with}}}{P_{\\mathrm{no}}}\n$$\nThe term $P_{\\mathrm{no}}$ represents the probability of successful transduction (encompassing all necessary steps like adsorption, injection, and recombination) under the condition that the incoming DNA is not subject to restriction. The term $P_{\\mathrm{with}}$ represents the probability of successful transduction when the restriction system is active.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the only difference between these two scenarios is the potential for the donor DNA fragment to be cleaved by the recipient's restriction endonuclease. Therefore, the probability of success in the presence of restriction, $P_{\\mathrm{with}}$, can be expressed as the product of two probabilities: the probability that the donor DNA fragment survives restriction (i.e., remains intact), and the probability of successful transduction given that the fragment has survived.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{with}} = P(\\text{success} | \\text{fragment survives}) \\times P(\\text{fragment survives})\n$$\nThe problem states that if restriction is the only differing factor, then the probability of successful transduction, given the fragment is intact, is simply $P_{\\mathrm{no}}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{with}} = P_{\\mathrm{no}} \\times P(\\text{fragment survives})\n$$\nNow, we must determine the probability that the DNA fragment survives. The fragment contains $s$ recognition sites for the restriction enzyme. The probability of cleavage at any single site is given as $c$. It follows that the probability of a single site *not* being cleaved is $1 - c$.\n\nThe problem specifies that cleavage events at each site are independent. For the entire fragment to survive intact, it is necessary that *all* $s$ sites escape cleavage. The probability of this compound event is the product of the individual probabilities for each site.\n$$\nP(\\text{fragment survives}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{s} P(\\text{site } i \\text{ is not cleaved})\n$$\nSince the probability of any site not being cleaved is $1 - c$, this expression becomes:\n$$\nP(\\text{fragment survives}) = (1 - c)^{s}\n$$\nThis also correctly handles the case where $s=0$. If there are no restriction sites, the probability of survival is $(1-c)^0 = 1$, which is logically correct.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{with}}$ yields:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{with}} = P_{\\mathrm{no}} (1 - c)^{s}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $P_{\\mathrm{with}}$ into the definition of $R$:\n$$\nR = 1 - \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{no}} (1 - c)^{s}}{P_{\\mathrm{no}}}\n$$\nAssuming $P_{\\mathrm{no}} \\neq 0$ (a trivial requirement, as without it transduction is impossible and the question is meaningless), the $P_{\\mathrm{no}}$ terms cancel:\n$$\nR = 1 - (1 - c)^{s}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the fractional reduction in transduction success as a function of the number of sites, $s$, and the per-site cleavage probability, $c$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - (1 - c)^{s}}\n$$", "id": "2805620"}, {"introduction": "Successful horizontal gene transfer culminates not just in DNA delivery, but in its stable establishment and inheritance in a new host lineage.

Over a window of $24$ hours, suppose the following are empirically well supported and apply in this system.\n\n- Conjugation: donor–recipient encounters occur as a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_{\\text{enc}} = 0.3$ per cell per $24$ hours, and each encounter yields a completed plasmid transfer with probability $\\pi_{\\text{cj}} = 0.4$.\n- Generalized transduction: adsorption of phage particles to the focal cell is a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_{\\text{ads}} = 0.7$ per $24$ hours, and a fraction $f_{\\text{td}} = 0.01$ of adsorbing particles are transducing carriers of the plasmid.\n- Natural transformation: competence bursts occur as a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_{\\text{tf}} = 0.05$ per $24$ hours, and, conditional on a burst, the probability that an intact plasmid is taken up and delivered to the cytoplasm is $\\pi_{\\text{pl}} = 0.2$.\n\nAssume that these three routes produce successful plasmid delivery attempts as independent Poisson processes, and that establishment within the $24$-hour window requires all of the following, assumed independent conditional on prior steps: (i) at least one successful plasmid delivery by any route within the window, (ii) initiation of plasmid replication in the new host, and (iii) survival of the initial plasmid-bearing lineage to the census at $24$ hours under immediate selection. Replication initiation succeeds if and only if the plasmid’s origin of replication is recognized by the host with probability $p_{\\text{ori}} = 0.65$, the plasmid evades host restriction–modification with probability $p_{\\text{rm}} = 0.60$, and it is not targeted by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) immunity with probability $p_{\\text{cr}} = 0.90$. The selection component is defined by relative Malthusian fitness: if the plasmid-free host has exponential growth rate $r_0$ and the plasmid-bearing host has exponential growth rate $r_p$, then the survival factor is $1 - s = r_p/r_0$. You may assume exponential growth with $r = \\ln 2 / T$, where $T$ is the doubling time.

The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and provides all necessary quantitative information. Therefore, a solution can be derived from first principles.\n\nThe overall probability of establishment, which we denote as $P_{\\text{est}}$, is contingent upon a sequence of independent events. As specified, establishment requires: ($1$) at least one successful plasmid delivery, ($2$) successful initiation of plasmid replication, and ($3$) survival of the new plasmid-bearing lineage. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of these three independent compound events:\n$$P_{\\text{est}} = P_{\\text{delivery}} \\times P_{\\text{initiation}} \\times P_{\\text{survival}}$$\n\nWe will now derive an expression for each of these probabilities.\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of at least one successful plasmid delivery, $P_{\\text{delivery}}$, within the $T = 24$ hour window. The problem states that plasmid delivery occurs via three independent routes, each modeled as a Poisson process.\n\nFor conjugation, donor-recipient encounters occur at a rate $\\lambda_{\\text{enc}} = 0.3$ per $24$ hours, with each encounter leading to a transfer with probability $\\pi_{\\text{cj}} = 0.4$. The process of successful conjugation events is therefore a \"thinned\" Poisson process with an effective rate $\\lambda_{\\text{conj}}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{conj}} = \\lambda_{\\text{enc}} \\times \\pi_{\\text{cj}} = 0.3 \\times 0.4 = 0.12 \\text{ per } 24 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nFor generalized transduction, phage adsorption occurs at a rate $\\lambda_{\\text{ads}} = 0.7$ per $24$ hours. A fraction $f_{\\text{td}} = 0.01$ of these phages carry the plasmid. The process of successful transducing particle delivery is also a thinned Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_{\\text{transd}}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{transd}} = \\lambda_{\\text{ads}} \\times f_{\\text{td}} = 0.7 \\times 0.01 = 0.007 \\text{ per } 24 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nFor natural transformation, competence bursts occur at a rate $\\lambda_{\\text{tf}} = 0.05$ per $24$ hours, and a successful uptake occurs with probability $\\pi_{\\text{pl}} = 0.2$ conditional on a burst. The rate of successful transformation events, $\\lambda_{\\text{transf}}$, is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{transf}} = \\lambda_{\\text{tf}} \\times \\pi_{\\text{pl}} = 0.05 \\times 0.2 = 0.01 \\text{ per } 24 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nSince these three processes are independent, the total process of successful plasmid delivery is also a Poisson process. Its rate, $\\lambda_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the individual rates:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{total}} = \\lambda_{\\text{conj}} + \\lambda_{\\text{transd}} + \\lambda_{\\text{transf}} = 0.12 + 0.007 + 0.01 = 0.137 \\text{ per } 24 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe number of successful delivery events, $N$, in the $24$-hour window follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = \\lambda_{\\text{total}} \\times T = 0.137 \\times 1 = 0.137$. The probability of at least one delivery event is $P(N \\ge 1)$, which is complementary to the probability of zero events, $P(N=0)$.\n$$P_{\\text{delivery}} = P(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N=0) = 1 - \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu) \\mu^0}{0!} = 1 - \\exp(-\\mu)$$\nSubstituting the value for $\\mu$:\n$$P_{\\text{delivery}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.137)$$\n\nSecond, we determine the probability of replication initiation, $P_{\\text{initiation}}$. This event requires the simultaneous satisfaction of three independent conditions: recognition of the origin of replication ($p_{\\text{ori}} = 0.65$), evasion of host restriction-modification systems ($p_{\\text{rm}} = 0.60$), and avoidance of CRISPR-Cas immunity ($p_{\\text{cr}} = 0.90$).

This is given by the relative Malthusian fitness, $1 - s = r_p / r_0$, where $r_p$ and $r_0$ are the exponential growth rates of the plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free hosts, respectively. The growth rate $r$ is related to the doubling time $T$ by $r = \\ln(2) / T$.\nThe growth rate for the plasmid-free host is $r_0 = \\ln(2) / T_0$, with $T_0 = 50$ minutes.\nThe growth rate for the plasmid-bearing host is $r_p = \\ln(2) / T_p$, with $T_p = 55$ minutes.\nThe survival probability is therefore the ratio of these growth rates:\n$$P_{\\text{survival}} = \\frac{r_p}{r_0} = \\frac{\\ln(2) / T_p}{\\ln(2) / T_0} = \\frac{T_0}{T_p}$$\nSubstituting the given doubling times:\n$$P_{\\text{survival}} = \\frac{50}{55} = \\frac{10}{11}$$\n\nFinally, we combine these three probabilities to find the total probability of establishment, $P_{\\text{est}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{est}} = P_{\\text{delivery}} \\times P_{\\text{initiation}} \\times P_{\\text{survival}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{est}} = \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.137)\\right) \\times (0.351) \\times \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically.\n$$1 - \\exp(-0.137) \\approx 1 - 0.871970 = 0.128030$$\n$$\\frac{10}{11} \\approx 0.909091$$\n$$P_{\\text{est}} \\approx 0.128030 \\times 0.351 \\times 0.909091$$\n$$P_{\\text{est}} \\approx 0.0449385 \\times 0.909091 \\approx 0.0408532$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.04085$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.04085}\n$$", "id": "2805632"}]}
