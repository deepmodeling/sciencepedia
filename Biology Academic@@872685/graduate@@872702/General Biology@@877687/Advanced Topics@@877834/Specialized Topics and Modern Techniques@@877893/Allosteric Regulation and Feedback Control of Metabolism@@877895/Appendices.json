A solution will be provided.\n\nThe model describes a two-state system for the enzyme $E$: an active state, $E_A$, and an inactive state, $E_I$. The total enzyme concentration, $E_T$, is conserved:\n$$ E_T = [E_A] + [E_I] $$\nThe transition to the inactive state is caused by the concerted binding of $n$ molecules of the inhibitor $P$:\n$$ E_A + nP \\rightleftharpoons E_I $$\nUnder the assumption of rapid binding equilibrium, we can write the mass-action expression for this process. The problem defines $K_I$ as the apparent dissociation constant. In the context of the Hill model, this implies a relationship of the form:\n$$ [E_I] = [E_A] \\frac{[P]^n}{K_I^n} $$\nThis formulation is consistent with defining $K_I$ as the concentration of $P$ at which $[E_A] = [E_I]$ (i.e., half-inhibition). Substituting this into the conservation equation for the enzyme:\n$$ E_T = [E_A] + [E_A] \\frac{[P]^n}{K_I^n} = [E_A] \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{[P]}{K_I}\\right)^n \\right) $$\nThe fraction of enzyme in the active state, $f_A$, is $\\frac{[E_A]}{E_T}$:\n$$ f_A = \\frac{[E_A]}{[E_A] \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{[P]}{K_I}\\right)^n \\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{P}{K_I}\\right)^n} $$\nwhere we now use $P$ to denote its concentration $[P]$. The flux $J$ is proportional to the concentration of active enzyme: $J = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E_A]$. Since $J_0 = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_T$, we can write the flux as:\n$$ J(P) = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} ([E_A]) = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} (f_A \\cdot E_T) = f_A \\cdot (k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_T) = J_0 \\cdot f_A $$\nTherefore, the functional dependence $J(P)$ is derived:\n$$ J(P) = J_0 \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{P}{K_I}\\right)^n} $$\nNext, we derive the expression for the ultrasensitivity response, $R(P) \\equiv \\left|\\frac{d \\ln J}{d \\ln P}\\right|$.

The result $R(K_I) = n/2$ demonstrates that at the half-inhibition point, the sensitivity of the system is directly proportional to the Hill coefficient $n$. A larger $n$, which corresponds to stronger positive cooperativity in inhibitor binding, results in a higher sensitivity. This is the definition of ultrasensitivity: a small relative change in the inhibitor concentration around $K_I$ can elicit a much larger relative change in the metabolic flux. For $n \\gt 2$, the response is ultrasensitive since $R(K_I) \\gt 1$.\n\nFinally, we address the third task. The baseline condition is at an end-product concentration of $P_0 = K_I$. The corresponding flux, $J_{baseline}$, is:\n$$ J_{baseline} = J(K_I) = J_0 \\frac{1}{1 + (K_I/K_I)^n} = \\frac{J_0}{2} $$\nA perturbation doubles the inhibitor concentration to $P_{new} = 2 P_0 = 2 K_I$. The new flux, $J_{new}$, is:\n$$ J_{new} = J(2 K_I) = J_0 \\frac{1}{1 + (2K_I/K_I)^n} = J_0 \\frac{1}{1 + 2^n} $$\nThe problem states that this perturbation causes the flux to decrease by a factor of $5$, which means $J_{new} = \\frac{1}{5} J_{baseline}$. We set up the equation:\n$$ J_0 \\frac{1}{1 + 2^n} = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{J_0}{2} \\right) $$\nThe $J_0$ terms cancel:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1 + 2^n} = \\frac{1}{10} $$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$ 1 + 2^n = 10 $$\n$$ 2^n = 9 $$\nTo find $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(2^n) = \\ln(9) $$\n$$ n \\ln(2) = \\ln(3^2) $$\n$$ n \\ln(2) = 2 \\ln(3) $$\nIsolating $n$ gives the final analytical expression:\n$$ n = \\frac{2 \\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2 \\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}} $$", "id": "2774288"}]}
