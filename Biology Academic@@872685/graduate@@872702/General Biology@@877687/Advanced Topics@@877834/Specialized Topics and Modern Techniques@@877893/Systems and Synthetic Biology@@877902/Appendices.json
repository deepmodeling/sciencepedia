It is grounded in established biophysical principles and is mathematically well-posed. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the definition of the dissociation constant and fractional occupancy. Let $[A]$ represent the concentration of the free aptamer, $[L]$ represent the concentration of the free ligand, and $[AL]$ represent the concentration of the ligand-aptamer complex. The binding equilibrium is given by:\n$$ A + L \\rightleftharpoons AL $$\nBy definition, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, for this reaction at equilibrium is:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[A][L]}{[AL]} $$\nThe problem states that the gene expression level is proportional to the fraction of riboswitches in the ligand-bound state.

Let $u = \\frac{x}{K}$, $v = \\frac{y}{K}$, and $\\tau = \\gamma t$. This implies $t = \\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma}$, $x=Ku$, and $y=Kv$. Substituting these into the first ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d(Ku)}{d(\\tau/\\gamma)} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+v^n} - \\gamma (Ku) \\implies \\gamma K \\frac{du}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+v^n} - \\gamma K u\n$$\nDividing by $\\gamma K$ gives the dimensionless form:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma K} \\frac{1}{1+v^n} - u\n$$\nLet us define the dimensionless synthesis rate $\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma K}$. The full dimensionless system is:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta}{1+v^n} - u\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta}{1+u^n} - v\n$$\nThe nullclines in this dimensionless plane are $u = \\frac{\\beta}{1+v^n}$ and $v = \\frac{\\beta}{1+u^n}$. The fixed points are the intersections of these two curves. Due to the symmetry of the equations, one fixed point always lies on the line $u=v$. The appearance of additional fixed points (from one to three) occurs at a saddle-node bifurcation. Geometrically, this bifurcation point is where the two nullcline curves become tangent to each other.\n\nLet the function defining the nullclines be $f(z) = \\frac{\\beta}{1+z^n}$. The nullclines are $u = f(v)$ and $v = f(u)$. The slope of the first nullcline in the $(u,v)$-plane is found by differentiating with respect to $u$: $1 = f'(v) \\frac{dv}{du}$, so $\\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{1}{f'(v)}$. The slope of the second nullcline is $\\frac{dv}{du} = f'(u)$.\n\nAt the point of tangency $(u_c, v_c)$, the slopes must be equal:\n$$\nf'(u_c) = \\frac{1}{f'(v_c)}\n$$\nBecause of the system's symmetry, the tangency that creates the new pair of fixed points occurs on the diagonal line $u=v$. Therefore, $u_c = v_c$. The condition becomes:\n$$\nf'(u_c) = \\frac{1}{f'(u_c)} \\implies (f'(u_c))^2 = 1\n$$\nThe derivative of $f(u)$ with respect to $u$ is:\n$$\nf'(u) = \\frac{d}{du}\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{1+u^n}\\right) = -\\frac{\\beta n u^{n-1}}{\\left(1+u^n\\right)^2}\n$$\nSince protein concentrations $u$ are non-negative, and all parameters $\\beta, n$ are positive, $f'(u)$ is always negative for $u0$. Thus, the tangency condition must be:\n$$\nf'(u_c) = -1\n$$\nThis gives our first equation for the critical point. The second equation is that the point $(u_c, u_c)$ must lie on the nullcline itself:\n$$\nu_c = f(u_c) = \\frac{\\beta_c}{1+u_c^n}\n$$\nHere, $\\beta_c$ is the critical value of $\\beta$ at which the bifurcation occurs. We now solve this system of two equations for the two unknowns $u_c$ and $\\beta_c$.\n\nFrom $f'(u_c) = -1$:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\beta_c n u_c^{n-1}}{(1+u_c^n)^2} = -1 \\implies \\beta_c n u_c^{n-1} = (1+u_c^n)^2\n$$\nFrom the nullcline equation, we have $\\beta_c = u_c(1+u_c^n)$. Substituting this into the slope equation:\n$$\n\\left(u_c(1+u_c^n)\\right) n u_c^{n-1} = (1+u_c^n)^2\n$$\nAssuming $1+u_c^n \\neq 0$, which is always true for non-negative $u_c$, we can divide by $(1+u_c^n)$:\n$$\nn u_c^n = 1+u_c^n\n$$\n$$\n(n-1)u_c^n = 1 \\implies u_c^n = \\frac{1}{n-1}\n$$\nFor a real, positive solution for $u_c$ to exist, we must have $\\frac{1}{n-1}  0$, which imposes a necessary condition on the Hill cooperativity:\n$$\nn  1\n$$\nIf $n \\le 1$, the cooperativity is insufficient to produce the required switching behavior, and only one fixed point will ever exist.\n\nNow, we solve for the critical dimensionless synthesis rate, $\\beta_c$. From $u_c^n = \\frac{1}{n-1}$, we get $u_c = \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{1/n} = (n-1)^{-1/n}$. Substituting this and $u_c^n$ back into the nullcline equation for $\\beta_c$:\n$$\n\\beta_c = u_c(1+u_c^n) = (n-1)^{-1/n} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_c = (n-1)^{-1/n} \\left(\\frac{n-1+1}{n-1}\\right) = (n-1)^{-1/n} \\left(\\frac{n}{n-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_c = n \\cdot (n-1)^{-1} \\cdot (n-1)^{-1/n} = n (n-1)^{-(1 + 1/n)} = n (n-1)^{-(n+1)/n}\n$$\nThis is the dimensionless critical synthesis rate. To find the final answer $\\alpha_c$, we re-dimensionalize:\n$$\n\\beta_c = \\frac{\\alpha_c}{\\gamma K} \\implies \\alpha_c = \\beta_c \\gamma K\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\beta_c$:\n$$\n\\alpha_c = \\gamma K n (n-1)^{-(n+1)/n}\n$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$\n\\alpha_c = \\frac{\\gamma K n}{(n-1)^{(n+1)/n}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the minimal synthesis rate $\\alpha_c$ required for the system to have three fixed points, contingent on the condition that the Hill coefficient $n1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\gamma K n}{(n-1)^{(n+1)/n}}}$$", "id": "2840929"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are only as powerful as their connection to experimental reality.
