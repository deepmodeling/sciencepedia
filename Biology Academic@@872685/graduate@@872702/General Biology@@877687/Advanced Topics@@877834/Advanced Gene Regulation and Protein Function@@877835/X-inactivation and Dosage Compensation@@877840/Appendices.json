Assume the following foundational facts:\n- In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by X-chromosome inactivation such that exactly $1$ X chromosome per somatic cell remains transcriptionally active (denoted $\\mathrm{X_a}$), while all additional X chromosomes are largely inactive (denoted $\\mathrm{X_i}$).\n- For the gene under study, the per-active-copy steady-state expression is $E$ (that is, one active allele on $\\mathrm{X_a}$ produces $E$ units at steady state).\n- On an inactive X chromosome $\\mathrm{X_i}$, this gene escapes inactivation to a constant fraction $p \\in [0, 1]$ of the active expression level, producing $pE$ from that allele.\n- Expression from different alleles is additive.\n- The gene has no homolog on the Y chromosome, so karyotype $\\mathrm{XY}$ carries only one allele on the X chromosome.\n- X-inactivation is random and may be mosaic across cells, but exactly $1$ X chromosome is active per cell in $\\mathrm{XX}$ and $\\mathrm{XXX}$ karyotypes.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA to RNA to protein) together with the additivity of allele-specific expression at steady state, compute the expected steady-state total expression per cell of this gene for each of the three karyotypes: $\\mathrm{XY}$, $\\mathrm{XX}$, and $\\mathrm{XXX}$.

It requires the application of explicitly stated rules of gene expression under X-chromosome inactivation to different karyotypes. The solution will be derived by a systematic analysis of each case.\n\nThe fundamental principle, as stated, is that the total steady-state expression of the gene within a single cell is the arithmetic sum of the expression from each allele on every X chromosome present in that cell. We are given the following definitions for per-allele expression:\n-   An allele on an active X chromosome ($\\mathrm{X_a}$) produces an expression level of $E$.\n-   An allele on an inactive X chromosome ($\\mathrm{X_i}$) produces an expression level of $pE$, where $p$ is the escape fraction, $p \\in [0,1]$.\n\nWe will now compute the total expression for each specified karyotype.\n\nCase 1: Karyotype $\\mathrm{XY}$\nA somatic cell with an $\\mathrm{XY}$ karyotype contains one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. The problem specifies that the gene is X-linked and has no Y-chromosome homolog. Therefore, the cell contains exactly one allele of this gene. With only one X chromosome, the process of X-inactivation does not occur, and this chromosome is, by definition, active ($\\mathrm{X_a}$).\nThe total expression is thus the contribution from the single allele on this active X chromosome.\n$$ \\text{Expression}_{\\mathrm{XY}} = E $$\n\nCase 2: Karyotype $\\mathrm{XX}$\nA somatic cell with an $\\mathrm{XX}$ karyotype contains two X chromosomes. According to the rules of dosage compensation, exactly one X chromosome is active ($\\mathrm{X_a}$) and the other is inactivated ($\\mathrm{X_i}$). While the choice of which chromosome to inactivate is random on a tissue-wide level, every individual cell will contain one $\\mathrm{X_a}$ and one $\\mathrm{X_i}$.\nThe total expression in a single cell is the sum of contributions from the allele on the active chromosome and the allele on the inactive chromosome.\nThe contribution from the allele on $\\mathrm{X_a}$ is $E$.\nThe contribution from the allele on $\\mathrm{X_i}$ is $pE$.\nApplying the principle of additivity, the total expression is:\n$$ \\text{Expression}_{\\mathrm{XX}} = (\\text{Expression from } \\mathrm{X_a}) + (\\text{Expression from } \\mathrm{X_i}) $$\n$$ \\text{Expression}_{\\mathrm{XX}} = E + pE = (1+p)E $$\nThe expected expression per cell is therefore $(1+p)E$.\n\nCase 3: Karyotype $\\mathrm{XXX}$\nA somatic cell with an $\\mathrm{XXX}$ karyotype contains three X chromosomes.

Xist repeat A binds the corepressor SPEN. SPEN recruits SMRT/NCoR and Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). This promotes transcriptional repression by deacetylation and RNA polymerase repression.\n-   **Wild Type Pathway (ii):** Xist repeats B/C recruit Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK). This leads to Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) installation of H2A K119 ubiquitination. This subsequently leads to Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) deposition of H3K27me3 across the Xi.\n-   **Engineered Mutation:** A precise mutation within Xist repeat A that abolishes SPEN binding, while the rest of Xist, including repeats B/C and their protein interactors, remains intact.\n-   **Post-Induction Assessment:** On the Xi, the following are assessed: nascent transcription, global levels of active histone acetylation (e.g., H3K27ac), and the accumulation of the heterochromatin mark H3K27me3.\n-   **Question:** Based on principles of chromatin acetylation's relation to transcription and the separability of the SPEN/HDAC3 and Polycomb recruitment pathways, what is the most consistent qualitative outcome?\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria.\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established molecular biology of X-chromosome inactivation. The roles of Xist lncRNA, its specific repeat domains (A, B/C), and their respective binding partners (SPEN, hnRNPK) are consistent with contemporary research. The downstream effector complexes (SMRT/NCoR-HDAC3, PRC1, PRC2) and their associated chromatin modifications (deacetylation, H2AK119ub1, H3K27me3) represent the canonical model of this process. The premise is factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It describes a defined biological system, introduces a specific and clean perturbation (abolishing the SPEN-Xist interaction), and asks for a predictable outcome on a set of well-defined molecular readouts. A logical, unique solution can be derived from the provided information.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and objective. It describes molecular entities and processes without resorting to subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n4.  **Completeness & Consistency:** The setup is self-contained. It explicitly describes two parallel pathways and specifies that the mutation only disrupts one of them. This is sufficient information to deduce the consequences. There are no internal contradictions.\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The described experiment is a standard approach in molecular genetics, using targeted mutations (e.g., via CRISPR/Cas9) to dissect protein-RNA interaction networks. It is entirely feasible.\n6.  **Ill-Posed or Trivial:** The problem is neither. It requires a substantive understanding of gene regulation, involving the distinct contributions of histone deacetylation and Polycomb-mediated repression to gene silencing. It is not a tautology or a simple memory-recall question.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides sufficient information for a rigorous analysis. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe problem asks for the predicted molecular phenotype on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) when the Xist-SPEN interaction is specifically disrupted. We must analyze the consequences based on the two separate pathways provided.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Disrupted Pathway (Pathway i):**\n    The engineered mutation abolishes the binding of SPEN to Xist repeat A. According to the problem statement, SPEN is responsible for recruiting the SMRT/NCoR-HDAC3 complex. HDAC3 is a histone deacetylase. Its function is to remove acetyl groups from histone tails. Histone acetylation, for example at H3K27 (H3K27ac), is a canonical mark of active chromatin and is strongly correlated with active transcription.\n    -   **Consequence on Histone Acetylation:** Since HDAC3 is not recruited to the Xi, the removal of acetyl groups will be impaired. Therefore, global levels of histone acetylation (e.g., H3K27ac) on the Xi should remain high, or \"elevated,\" relative to a wild-type Xi where these marks would be erased.\n    -   **Consequence on Transcription:** Pathway (i) is stated to promote \"transcriptional repression.\" The loss of this pathway implies that this mode of repression will fail. As a result, nascent transcription from many X-linked genes will not be efficiently silenced and will therefore \"persist.\"\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Intact Pathway (Pathway ii):**\n    The problem explicitly states that repeats B/C of Xist and their interactors (hnRNPK) are intact. This pathway leads to the recruitment of PRC1 and subsequently PRC2. PRC2's key function is to methylate histone H3 at lysine 27, creating the repressive mark H3K27me3.\n    -   **Consequence on H3K27me3:** Since this pathway is structurally intact, PRC1 and PRC2 will be recruited to the Xi. This will lead to the deposition of H3K27me3 across the chromosome. Thus, H3K27me3 is expected to accumulate.\n    -   **Interplay between Pathways:** A fundamental principle in chromatin biology is the antagonism between active and repressive marks. Active transcription and its associated mark H3K27ac can oppose the deposition and maintenance of the repressive mark H3K27me3. Since we predict that transcription and H3K27ac will persist at many gene loci on the mutant Xi, it is logical to conclude that the deposition of H3K27me3 will be less efficient or \"reduced\" specifically at these actively transcribed regions (e.g., promoters and gene bodies), even if it accumulates elsewhere on the chromosome.\n\n3.  **Summary of Predicted Outcome:**\n    -   **Nascent Transcription:** Not silenced efficiently; persists at many X-linked genes.\n    -   **Histone Acetylation (H3K27ac):** Remains high/elevated.\n    -   **H3K27me3:** Accumulates across the Xi, but with reduced enrichment at the specific loci that remain transcriptionally active.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Nascent transcription on Xi is efficiently silenced, histone acetylation on Xi decreases strongly, and H3K27me3 accumulates Xi-wide to near wild type levels.**\n-   `Nascent transcription on Xi is efficiently silenced`: Incorrect. The SPEN-HDAC3 pathway, a key component of transcriptional repression, is explicitly disabled.\n-   `histone acetylation on Xi decreases strongly`: Incorrect. The responsible histone deacetylase, HDAC3, is not recruited to the Xi. Acetylation should remain high.\n-   `H3K27me3 accumulates...`: This part is plausible on its own, but the first two premises are incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Nascent transcription on Xi persists at many X-linked genes, histone acetylation on Xi remains elevated relative to wild type, and H3K27me3 still accumulates across Xi via Polycomb pathways but shows reduced enrichment specifically at persistently transcribed promoters.**\n-   `Nascent transcription on Xi persists at many X-linked genes`: Correct. This is the direct consequence of disabling the SPEN-mediated transcriptional repression pathway.\n-   `histone acetylation on Xi remains elevated relative to wild type`: Correct. This is the direct consequence of the failure to recruit HDAC3.\n-   `H3K27me3 still accumulates ... but shows reduced enrichment specifically at persistently transcribed promoters`: Correct. This accurately describes the function of the intact Polycomb pathway and accounts for the known antagonism between active transcription and Polycomb-mediated repression.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Nascent transcription on Xi persists, histone acetylation on Xi decreases due to compensatory pathways, and H3K27me3 is largely absent because Polycomb recruitment depends on SPEN.**\n-   `Nascent transcription on Xi persists`: Correct.\n-   `histone acetylation on Xi decreases due to compensatory pathways`: Incorrect. This is speculative and contradicts the most direct consequence of losing HDAC3 recruitment. The problem asks for the outcome based on the given principles, not unstated compensatory mechanisms.\n-   `H3K27me3 is largely absent because Polycomb recruitment depends on SPEN`: Incorrect. The problem explicitly defines the Polycomb recruitment pathway (via repeats B/C and hnRNPK) as separate and independent from the SPEN-binding pathway (repeat A).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Nascent transcription on Xi is efficiently silenced, histone acetylation on Xi remains high, and H3K27me3 fails to accumulate due to ongoing transcription.**\n-   `Nascent transcription on Xi is efficiently silenced`: Incorrect. This is the primary error, as in option A.\n-   `histone acetylation on Xi remains high`: Correct.\n-   The statement contains an internal contradiction: it claims silencing is efficient, but then posits that \"ongoing transcription\" prevents H3K27me3 accumulation. These two conditions cannot both be true.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Nascent transcription on Xi persists, histone acetylation on Xi remains high, and H3K27me3 is globally absent across Xi because SPEN is required for PRC2 recruitment.**\n-   `Nascent transcription on Xi persists`: Correct.\n-   `histone acetylation on Xi remains high`: Correct.\n-   `H3K27me3 is globally absent across Xi because SPEN is required for PRC2 recruitment`: Incorrect. This makes the same error as option C, incorrectly linking the SPEN pathway to Polycomb recruitment, in direct contradiction to the problem's definition of two separate pathways.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the provided principles, option B is the only statement that correctly describes all three molecular consequences of the specified mutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2848715"}, {"introduction": "The process of choosing which X chromosome to inactivate is not deterministic but fundamentally stochastic.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on established principles of molecular biology and stochastic modeling. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem describes a competition between two independent stochastic events. The time until stable Xist upregulation on the wild-type X chromosome, let us call this random variable $T_{\\mathrm{WT}}$, follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $r_{\\mathrm{WT}}$. Similarly, the time until upregulation on the Tsix-truncated X chromosome, $T_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}$, follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}$.\n\nThe probability density functions (PDFs) are:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{WT}}(t) = r_{\\mathrm{WT}} e^{-r_{\\mathrm{WT}}t} \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0$$\n$$f_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}(t) = r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} e^{-r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}t} \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0$$\n\nThe Tsix-truncated X chromosome becomes the inactive X (Xi) if it is the first to upregulate Xist. This corresponds to the event $T_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} < T_{\\mathrm{WT}}$. We must calculate the probability of this event, $P(T_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} < T_{\\mathrm{WT}})$.\n\nFor two independent exponential random variables $T_1$ with rate $\\lambda_1$ and $T_2$ with rate $\\lambda_2$, the probability that $T_1$ occurs before $T_2$ is a standard result from probability theory:\n$$P(T_1 < T_2) = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2}$$\n\nThis result arises intuitively from the fact that the two processes are \"racing\", and the probability of winning is proportional to one's rate. Formally, it is calculated by integrating the joint PDF over the appropriate region:\n$$P(T_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} < T_{\\mathrm{WT}}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}(t) \\cdot P(T_{\\mathrm{WT}} > t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} e^{-r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}t}) \\cdot (e^{-r_{\\mathrm{WT}}t}) \\, dt$$\n$$= r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} + r_{\\mathrm{WT}})t} \\, dt = r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} \\left[ \\frac{-1}{r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} + r_{\\mathrm{WT}}} e^{-(r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} + r_{\\mathrm{WT}})t} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$$\n$$= \\frac{r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}}{r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} + r_{\\mathrm{WT}}} (-(0-1)) = \\frac{r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}}{r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} + r_{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\n\nWe are given the relationship $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} = \\alpha \\, r_{\\mathrm{WT}}$. Substituting this into the probability expression:\n$$P(\\text{Tsix-truncated X becomes Xi}) = \\frac{\\alpha \\, r_{\\mathrm{WT}}}{\\alpha \\, r_{\\mathrm{WT}} + r_{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\, r_{\\mathrm{WT}}}{(\\alpha + 1) r_{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\nThe rate $r_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ cancels out, showing the result depends only on the relative rates:\n$$P(\\text{Tsix-truncated X becomes Xi}) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + 1}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value for $\\alpha$, which is $\\alpha = 3$.\n$$P(\\text{Tsix-truncated X becomes Xi}) = \\frac{3}{3 + 1} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$\nThe probability that the Tsix-truncated X chromosome becomes the Xi is $0.75$. The specific value of $r_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ is consistent but not required for the final calculation, as long as $\\alpha$ is known.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $0.25$**\nThis value would represent the probability that the wild-type X chromosome becomes the Xi. This is calculated as $P(T_{\\mathrm{WT}} < T_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}}) = 1 - P(T_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} < T_{\\mathrm{WT}}) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$. The question asks for the probability that the *Tsix-truncated* X becomes the Xi. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $0.50$**\nA probability of $0.50$ would imply that both X chromosomes have an equal chance of being inactivated. This would only occur if their rates of Xist upregulation were identical, i.e., $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{Tsix}} = r_{\\mathrm{WT}}$, which means $\\alpha = 1$. The problem statement explicitly gives $\\alpha = 3$, indicating a biased choice. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $0.75$**\nThis value matches the derived probability of $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+1} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$. The higher rate of Xist upregulation on the Tsix-truncated chromosome makes it more likely to be chosen for inactivation, and the calculated probability is precisely $0.75$. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\n**D. Approximately $1.00$ (i.e., very close to certainty)**\nThis would imply that the inactivation of the Tsix-truncated chromosome is nearly deterministic. This would require $\\alpha \\to \\infty$. With $\\alpha=3$, the probability is exactly $0.75$, which is significantly different from $1.00$. The choice is skewed, but far from certain.
