A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nLet $[U]$ and $[M]$ represent the number of molecules in the unfolded and misfolded states, respectively. The dynamics of these populations are described by the following system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d[U]}{dt} = s - k_f [U] - k_m [U]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]}{dt} = k_m [U] - k_d [M]\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the system is at steady state. At steady state, the concentrations of the transient intermediates, $[U]$ and $[M]$, are constant. Therefore, their time derivatives are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d[U]_{ss}}{dt} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]_{ss}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nHere, the subscript $ss$ denotes the steady-state value.\n\nApplying this condition to the first equation:\n$$\ns - k_f [U]_{ss} - k_m [U]_{ss} = 0\n$$\n$$\ns = (k_f + k_m) [U]_{ss}\n$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the steady-state concentration of unfolded proteins:\n$$\n[U]_{ss} = \\frac{s}{k_f + k_m}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ultimate fractions of proteins that are correctly folded or degraded. These fractions are determined by the partitioning of the total flux at the branch points of the network. The total influx of new proteins is $s$. This flux is partitioned at state $U$ into a folding flux, $J_N$, and a misfolding flux, $J_M$.\n\nThe flux of proteins towards the native state $N$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_N = k_f [U]_{ss}\n$$\nThe flux of proteins towards the misfolded state $M$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_M = k_m [U]_{ss}\n$$\nAccording to the model, all proteins that enter state $M$ are committed to degradation, as it is the only exit path from $M$. Therefore, the flux of degraded proteins, $J_D$, must equal the flux into the misfolded state at steady state, $J_M$. This is also confirmed by the steady-state equation for $[M]$: $k_m [U]_{ss} = k_d [M]_{ss} = J_D$.\n\nThe fraction of total synthesized protein flux ($s$) that is directed to the native state, $f_N$, is the ratio of the folding flux $J_N$ to the total synthesis rate $s$:\n$$\nf_N = \\frac{J_N}{s} = \\frac{k_f [U]_{ss}}{s}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[U]_{ss}$:\n$$\nf_N = \\frac{k_f}{s} \\left( \\frac{s}{k_f + k_m} \\right) = \\frac{k_f}{k_f + k_m}\n$$\nSimilarly, the fraction of total synthesized protein flux that is ultimately degraded, $f_D$, is the ratio of the degradation flux $J_D$ to the total synthesis rate $s$. As established, $J_D = J_M = k_m [U]_{ss}$.\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{J_D}{s} = \\frac{k_m [U]_{ss}}{s}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[U]_{ss}$:\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{k_m}{s} \\left( \\frac{s}{k_f + k_m} \\right) = \\frac{k_m}{k_f + k_m}\n$$\nThese fractions represent the probabilistic outcome for any given protein entering the unfolded pool $U$. The probability of folding is the ratio of its specific rate constant ($k_f$) to the sum of all rate constants for pathways exiting $U$ ($k_f + k_m$). The probability of misfolding (and subsequent degradation) is the ratio of its rate constant ($k_m$) to the same total exit rate.\n\nNote that the rate constant for degradation, $k_d$, and the synthesis rate, $s$, do not appear in the final expressions for the fractions. The rate $k_d$ determines the steady-state level of misfolded protein, $[M]_{ss}$, but not the fraction of flux that is channeled into the degradation pathway. The synthesis rate $s$ cancels out, as we are concerned with fractions of the total flux, not the absolute magnitude of the fluxes.\n\nAs a check for consistency, the sum of the fractions must equal $1$, as folding and degradation are the only two possible fates:\n$$\nf_N + f_D = \\frac{k_f}{k_f + k_m} + \\frac{k_m}{k_f + k_m} = \\frac{k_f + k_m}{k_f + k_m} = 1\n$$\nThe logic is sound and the results are consistent. The final answer is the row vector of these two fractions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k_f}{k_f + k_m}  \\frac{k_m}{k_f + k_m} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2828959"}, {"introduction": "To be effective, cellular stress responses must often convert a continuous, graded input into a decisive, switch-like output.

The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) sensor Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1) oligomerizes and activates an endoribonuclease that splices X-box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1) messenger RNA (mRNA). At steady state, the fraction of XBP1 mRNA in the spliced form is measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and normalized between $0$ (baseline with no stressor) and $1$ (saturating stressor). Assume that, at steady state, the spliced fraction is proportional to the fraction of active IRE1 complexes and that activation follows a cooperative equilibrium mechanism.\n\nYou are given the following dataset of ER stressor concentration $S$ and corresponding normalized XBP1 splicing fraction $f$:\n- $S = 2 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$, $f = \\frac{1}{26}$\n- $S = 5 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$, $f = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- $S = 10 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$, $f = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $S = 20 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$, $f = \\frac{4}{5}$\n- $S = 50 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$, $f = \\frac{25}{26}$\n\nStarting from mass-action and the definition of cooperative activation, justify the use of a Hill-type model with zero baseline and unit maximum for $f(S)$, derive an appropriate linearization that permits estimation of the apparent Hill coefficient (cooperativity) of IRE1 activation from these data, and compute its numerical value. Report the apparent Hill coefficient as a pure number; if needed, round to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem as presented is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem asks to model the fraction of spliced XBP1 mRNA, denoted $f$, as a function of the ER stressor concentration, $S$. We are given that the activation of the IRE1 enzyme, which catalyzes this splicing, follows a cooperative equilibrium mechanism. We can model this by considering the equilibrium between an inactive state of the enzyme and an active state, which is formed by the cooperative binding of $n$ molecules of the stressor $S$. Let $E_{inactive}$ be the inactive form and $E_{active}$ be the active form of the enzyme. The overall reaction can be simplified as:\n$$ E_{inactive} + nS \\rightleftharpoons E_{active} $$\nwhere $n$ is the Hill coefficient, representing the degree of cooperativity.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, for this reaction is given by:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[E_{inactive}][S]^n}{[E_{active}]} $$\nThe total concentration of the enzyme is $[E]_{total} = [E_{inactive}] + [E_{active}]$. The fraction of active enzyme, which we will call $\\theta$, is given by:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[E_{active}]}{[E]_{total}} = \\frac{[E_{active}]}{[E_{inactive}] + [E_{active}]} $$\nFrom the expression for $K_d$, we can write $[E_{inactive}]$ as:\n$$ [E_{inactive}] = \\frac{K_d [E_{active}]}{[S]^n} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[E_{active}]}{\\frac{K_d [E_{active}]}{[S]^n} + [E_{active}]} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[S]^n} + 1} = \\frac{[S]^n}{K_d + [S]^n} $$\nThis is the general form of the Hill equation. It is common to define a constant $K_A$ as the concentration of ligand $S$ that yields half-maximal activation, i.e., $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ when $[S] = K_A$. Substituting this condition:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K_A^n}{K_d + K_A^n} \\implies K_d + K_A^n = 2K_A^n \\implies K_d = K_A^n $$\nTherefore, the Hill equation can be written in its standard form:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[S]^n}{K_A^n + [S]^n} $$\nThe problem states that the measured spliced fraction $f$ is proportional to the fraction of active IRE1 complexes ($\\theta$) and is normalized between $0$ and $1$. This allows us to directly equate $f$ with $\\theta$, so the model for our system is:\n$$ f(S) = \\frac{S^n}{K_A^n + S^n} $$\nThis justifies the use of a Hill-type model for the given data.\n\nTo estimate the Hill coefficient $n$ from the experimental data, we must linearize this equation.

Therefore, the total amount of protein that successfully matures is given by the intensity of band C at $t=120$ min, which we denote as $C_{final}$. The total amount of protein that is ultimately degraded is the initial amount minus the amount that successfully matures, $D_{total} = I_0 - C_{final}$.\n\n**Task 1: Compute the \"fraction rescued\"**\n\nFirst, we determine the final outcomes for the vehicle and chaperone conditions.\nLet the subscripts 'veh' and 'chap' denote the vehicle and chaperone conditions, respectively.\n\nFor the **vehicle condition**:\nThe amount of successfully matured CFTR is the band C intensity at $t=120$ min.\n$$C_{veh, final} = C_{veh}(120) = 1800 \\text{ cpm}$$\nThe total amount of CFTR lost to ERAD is the initial amount minus this matured amount.\n$$D_{veh, total} = I_0 - C_{veh, final} = 10000 - 1800 = 8200 \\text{ cpm}$$\n\nFor the **chemical chaperone condition**:\nThe amount of successfully matured CFTR is:\n$$C_{chap, final} = C_{chap}(120) = 3700 \\text{ cpm}$$\n\nThe definition of \"fraction rescued\", $F_{rescued}$, is the number of molecules that are rescued from degradation (and thus appear as band C under chaperone treatment) divided by the number of molecules that would have been degraded under vehicle treatment.\nThe number of molecules rescued is the increase in the matured population due to the chaperone.\n$$\\text{Rescued amount} = C_{chap, final} - C_{veh, final} = 3700 - 1800 = 1900 \\text{ cpm}$$\nThese $1900$ cpm worth of protein would have been degraded in the vehicle condition.

The fraction of proteins that are degraded under the chaperone condition, $f_{d, chap}$, can be calculated.\nThe total amount of protein degraded is the initial amount minus the final matured amount.\n$$D_{chap, total} = I_0 - C_{chap, final} = 10000 - 3700 = 6300 \\text{ cpm}$$\nThe fraction of the cohort that is degraded is:\n$$f_{d, chap} = \\frac{D_{chap, total}}{I_0} = \\frac{6300}{10000} = 0.63$$\nThis fraction, $f_{d, chap}$, represents the probability that any newly synthesized CFTR molecule will be degraded.\nAt steady state, the ERAD load, $L_{ERAD}$, is the rate of synthesis multiplied by the fraction of molecules that are degraded.\n$$L_{ERAD} = s \\times f_{d, chap}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{ERAD} = (1.2 \\times 10^5 \\text{ molecules/min}) \\times 0.63 = 75600 \\text{ molecules/min}$$\nExpressing this result in scientific notation and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$L_{ERAD} = 7.560 \\times 10^4 \\text{ molecules/min}$$\n\nThe two requested values are the fraction rescued ($0.2317$) and the ERAD load ($7.560 \\times 10^4$ molecules/min).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2317  7.560 \\times 10^{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2828907"}]}
