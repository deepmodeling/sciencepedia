## Introduction
The integrity of a cell hinges on the proper functioning of its proteome, the vast collection of proteins that execute nearly all cellular tasks. This [proteome](@entry_id:150306) exists in a fragile, dynamic balance known as [proteostasis](@entry_id:155284), a state maintained by a sophisticated network of pathways responsible for protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation. However, errors in these processes are inevitable, leading to the accumulation of misfolded or non-functional proteins. Such [proteotoxic stress](@entry_id:152245) poses a grave threat to cellular health and is a root cause of numerous human diseases, from neurodegeneration to cancer. This article delves into the core machinery that cells deploy to manage this constant challenge: the [protein quality control](@entry_id:154781) (PQC) network.

To navigate this complex topic, the article is structured into three distinct chapters. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, lays the theoretical groundwork by dissecting the key pathways of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). It explains how cells sense [protein misfolding](@entry_id:156137) stress in the endoplasmic reticulum and execute a precise, multi-pronged response to either restore balance or initiate [cell death](@entry_id:169213). The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, moves from mechanism to consequence, illustrating how these PQC pathways function in the context of human genetic diseases, [infectious disease](@entry_id:182324), aging, and cancer, highlighting their role as both a cause of pathology and a target for therapy. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter provides an opportunity to apply these concepts through quantitative problems, connecting theoretical models to experimental data analysis. Together, these sections offer a comprehensive journey into the world of [protein quality control](@entry_id:154781), from fundamental biochemistry to its profound impact on human health.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Concept of Proteostasis: A Dynamic Balancing Act

The functional identity of a cell is defined by its [proteome](@entry_id:150306)—the complete set of proteins expressed at a given time. This [proteome](@entry_id:150306), however, is not a static collection of molecules. It exists in a state of [dynamic equilibrium](@entry_id:136767), known as **[proteostasis](@entry_id:155284)**, which encompasses the continuous processes of protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation. Maintaining this balance is a fundamental challenge for all living organisms, as the failure to do so can lead to the accumulation of non-functional or toxic protein species, a hallmark of numerous diseases.

To understand the challenges of [proteostasis](@entry_id:155284), we can consider a simplified kinetic model of a protein's life cycle. Following synthesis on the ribosome, a [polypeptide chain](@entry_id:144902) exists in a largely **unfolded state** ($U$). From this state, it must navigate a complex free-energy landscape to attain its unique, functional three-dimensional structure, the **native state** ($N$). However, the folding process is fraught with peril. The polypeptide may become trapped in a kinetically stable, non-functional conformation, entering a **misfolded soluble state** ($M_s$). These misfolded species often expose hydrophobic amino acid residues that are normally buried within the protein's core. In the highly crowded environment of the cell, these "sticky" hydrophobic patches can promote off-pathway self-association, leading to the formation of potentially toxic, insoluble **aggregates** ($A$).

The cell has evolved a sophisticated network of [protein quality control](@entry_id:154781) (PQC) systems to manage these different protein states and prevent the deleterious consequences of misfolding and aggregation [@problem_id:2828856]. This network can be broadly divided into two arms: a proactive, salvage-oriented arm and a terminal, degradative arm.

The first line of defense is a vast array of molecular **chaperones**. These proteins, such as the Heat Shock Protein (Hsp) families (e.g., Hsp70, Hsp90), act as folding facilitators. They recognize and bind to the exposed [hydrophobic surfaces](@entry_id:148780) of unfolded or [misfolded proteins](@entry_id:192457) ($M_s$), preventing their aggregation. By coupling cycles of ATP hydrolysis to [substrate binding](@entry_id:201127) and release, chaperones can facilitate the correct folding of nascent chains, promote the refolding of misfolded intermediates back to the native state ($N$), and, if a protein is deemed terminally misfolded, direct it towards degradation.

When a protein cannot be salvaged, it must be eliminated. The cell employs two major degradative pathways that are largely specialized for different types of substrates. The **[ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387)–[proteasome](@entry_id:172113) system (UPS)** is the primary pathway for the degradation of most short-lived regulatory proteins and misfolded soluble proteins ($M_s$). As we will explore, its mechanism requires the substrate to be threaded through a narrow channel, a process limited to soluble, loosely folded polypeptides. In contrast, large structures such as protein aggregates ($A$) or even entire [organelles](@entry_id:154570) are inaccessible to the proteasome. Their clearance is managed by **autophagy**, a process in which a double-membraned vesicle, the autophagosome, engulfs bulk cytosolic cargo and delivers it to the lysosome for degradation. Thus, under basal conditions, chaperones, the UPS, and [autophagy](@entry_id:146607) work in a coordinated, non-redundant fashion to survey the [proteome](@entry_id:150306) and maintain the delicate balance of [proteostasis](@entry_id:155284).

### The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS): The Primary Pathway for Selective Protein Degradation

The targeted destruction of specific proteins is not a random process; it is a highly regulated mechanism essential for countless cellular functions, from cell cycle progression to [signal transduction](@entry_id:144613) and the elimination of damaged proteins. The UPS achieves this specificity through a molecular "tagging" system, where the small protein **[ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387)** is covalently attached to substrates destined for destruction.

#### The Ubiquitin Tag: A Molecular Signal for Destruction

Ubiquitin is a highly conserved, 76-amino-acid protein. Its attachment to a substrate protein, a process known as **[ubiquitination](@entry_id:147203)**, is accomplished through a three-enzyme hierarchical cascade: an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and an E3 [ligase](@entry_id:139297) [@problem_id:2828882]. This cascade functions to activate the C-terminal carboxylate of ubiquitin and facilitate its transfer to a nucleophilic lysine residue on the substrate.

The process begins with the **E1 [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387)-activating enzyme**. In an ATP-dependent reaction, E1 first adenylates the C-terminal [glycine](@entry_id:176531) (Gly76) of [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387), forming a high-energy ubiquitin-AMP intermediate and releasing pyrophosphate ($PP_i$). The activated [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) is then transferred to the thiol group of a cysteine residue in the E1 active site, forming a covalent [thioester bond](@entry_id:173810) (E1~Ub) and releasing AMP. This two-step activation primes [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) for the next step.

The activated [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) is then passed to an **E2 [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387)-conjugating enzyme**. This occurs via a trans-thioesterification reaction, where an active-site cysteine on the E2 enzyme attacks the E1~Ub [thioester bond](@entry_id:173810), resulting in the formation of a new [thioester](@entry_id:199403)-linked conjugate (E2~Ub) and the release of the E1 enzyme. While there are only a few E1 enzymes in most eukaryotes, there are dozens of E2s, providing an initial layer of specificity.

The final and most critical step for [substrate specificity](@entry_id:136373) is mediated by an **E3 ubiquitin [ligase](@entry_id:139297)**. There are hundreds of different E3 ligases in the human genome, each evolved to recognize specific substrates or classes of substrates. The E3 [ligase](@entry_id:139297) acts as a scaffold, simultaneously binding to both the E2~Ub conjugate and the target protein. By bringing the reactive components into close proximity, the E3 facilitates the [nucleophilic attack](@entry_id:151896) by the $\varepsilon$-amino group of a lysine side chain on the substrate onto the [thioester bond](@entry_id:173810) of the E2~Ub complex. This results in the formation of a stable **[isopeptide bond](@entry_id:167736)** between the C-terminal [glycine](@entry_id:176531) of [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) and the substrate's lysine residue. E3 ligases can be broadly classified by their mechanism. **RING** (Really Interesting New Gene) finger E3s act as scaffolds that catalyze the direct transfer of [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) from E2 to the substrate. In contrast, **HECT** (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) and **RBR** (RING-between-RING) E3s first accept the [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) from the E2 onto an active-site [cysteine](@entry_id:186378) of their own, forming an E3~Ub [thioester](@entry_id:199403) intermediate before transferring it to the substrate.

This process can be repeated, adding further ubiquitin moieties to lysines on the previously attached ubiquitin, forming a polyubiquitin chain. The type of linkage between [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) molecules (e.g., on Lysine 48 or Lysine 63 of ubiquitin) creates a "[ubiquitin code](@entry_id:178249)" that dictates the substrate's fate. Chains linked via Lysine 48 ($K48$) are the canonical signal for degradation by the proteasome.

#### The 26S Proteasome: The Cellular Executioner

Once a protein is tagged with a $K48$-linked polyubiquitin chain, it is recognized and degraded by the **26S proteasome**, a massive, ATP-dependent [protease](@entry_id:204646) complex. The architecture of the [proteasome](@entry_id:172113) is a marvel of [molecular engineering](@entry_id:188946), elegantly designed to solve the fundamental problems of targeted degradation: specificity, [processivity](@entry_id:274928), and the prevention of collateral damage [@problem_id:2828820].

The proteasome is composed of two main subcomplexes: a central **20S core particle (CP)** and one or two **19S regulatory particles (RP)** that cap the ends of the core.

The **20S core particle** is the catalytic engine of the proteasome. It is a barrel-shaped structure composed of four stacked heptameric rings, arranged in an $\alpha_7\beta_7\beta_7\alpha_7$ configuration. This structure creates an enclosed central chamber, sequestering the proteolytic active sites from the rest of the cell and thus preventing indiscriminate [protein degradation](@entry_id:187883). The outer $\alpha$-rings form a gated channel that controls entry into the chamber. The inner two $\beta$-rings contain the proteolytic [active sites](@entry_id:152165). These are not typical serine or [cysteine](@entry_id:186378) proteases; rather, they are **N-terminal threonine proteases**, located on specific $\beta$ subunits ($\beta1$, $\beta2$, and $\beta5$ in mammals), each with a different substrate preference (caspase-like, [trypsin](@entry_id:167497)-like, and [chymotrypsin](@entry_id:162618)-like, respectively).

The **19S regulatory particle** acts as the gatekeeper, recognizing ubiquitinated substrates and preparing them for degradation. It is itself composed of two subcomplexes: a base and a lid. The **base** sits directly atop the $\alpha$-ring of the 20S core. It contains a ring of six distinct **AAA$^{+}$ ATPases** (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) that form a powerful molecular motor. This motor performs several crucial functions: it recognizes the polyubiquitin tag (often with the help of intrinsic [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) receptors), unfolds the doomed substrate protein—a necessary step for it to pass through the narrow channel of the 20S core—and then translocates the linearized polypeptide into the catalytic chamber. The **lid** sits atop the base and contains additional [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) receptors as well as **deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs)**. These DUBs cleave the polyubiquitin chain from the substrate just before it is committed to degradation, allowing the ubiquitin monomers to be recycled for future use. This intricate, axially coupled machine ensures that once a substrate is engaged, it is processively unfolded, deubiquitinated, translocated, and destroyed without the chance of escape.

### The Endoplasmic Reticulum: A Unique Environment for Protein Quality Control

While the principles of [proteostasis](@entry_id:155284) apply throughout the cell, the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** presents a unique and formidable [protein quality control](@entry_id:154781) challenge. The ER is the entry point for the secretory pathway, responsible for the synthesis, folding, and modification of roughly one-third of the cellular [proteome](@entry_id:150306), including all secreted, transmembrane, and organellar proteins. This massive flux of proteins enters a unique biochemical environment characterized by an oxidizing lumen that facilitates [disulfide bond formation](@entry_id:183070), high concentrations of calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) required for chaperone function, and the machinery for N-linked glycosylation, a modification critical for the folding of many proteins.

The balance between the load of proteins entering the ER and the ER's folding capacity is precarious. Any condition that disrupts this balance—by increasing the protein folding load or by impairing the folding environment—leads to an accumulation of unfolded or [misfolded proteins](@entry_id:192457) in the ER lumen. This state is known as **ER stress** [@problem_id:2828956]. A wide variety of perturbations can induce ER stress, including:
-   **Inhibition of N-linked [glycosylation](@entry_id:163537)** (e.g., by the drug tunicamycin).
-   **Depletion of ER $Ca^{2+}$ stores** (e.g., by the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin).
-   **Disruption of the oxidizing environment** required for disulfide bonds (e.g., by the reducing agent dithiothreitol).
-   **Massive overexpression of a secretory protein**, which simply overwhelms the folding machinery.
-   **Perturbations to the ER [membrane composition](@entry_id:173244)**, known as bilayer stress.

To cope with ER stress, cells have evolved a sophisticated signaling network called the **Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)**. The UPR is a homeostatic program that senses the level of misfolded proteins in the ER and transmits this information to the cytosol and nucleus, initiating a transcriptional and translational program designed to restore ER [proteostasis](@entry_id:155284).

### The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR): Sensing and Responding to ER Stress

In metazoans, the UPR is initiated by three ER-resident transmembrane sensor proteins: **inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)**, **PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)**, and **activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)**. Under basal conditions, these sensors are typically kept in an inactive state through their association with the abundant ER-lumenal chaperone **BiP** (also known as GRP78). When unfolded proteins accumulate, BiP is titrated away as it is recruited to assist in folding these clients. This release, in combination with direct binding of unfolded polypeptides to the sensors' lumenal domains, triggers their activation.

#### The IRE1 Pathway: Splicing for Survival

IRE1 is the most evolutionarily conserved UPR sensor. It is a type I [transmembrane protein](@entry_id:176217) with an N-terminal lumenal sensor domain and a C-terminal cytosolic region containing both a serine/threonine kinase domain and an endoribonuclease (RNase) domain [@problem_id:2828971]. Upon activation by ER stress, IRE1 molecules dimerize and oligomerize in the plane of the ER membrane. This clustering allows the cytosolic kinase domains to **trans-autophosphorylate** one another, an event which serves as an allosteric switch to activate the adjacent RNase domain.

The activated IRE1 RNase has a highly specific function: it performs an unconventional [splicing](@entry_id:261283) of the mRNA encoding the transcription factor **X-box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1)**. IRE1 precisely excises a 26-nucleotide intron from the XBP1 mRNA. This splicing event causes a frameshift during translation, producing a more stable and potent version of the transcription factor, known as spliced XBP1 (XBP1s). XBP1s translocates to the nucleus and drives the expression of a broad set of UPR target genes, including those encoding ER chaperones, folding enzymes, and components of the ER degradation machinery. This response aims to increase the ER's folding and clearance capacity. Under prolonged stress, the IRE1 RNase can also engage in **Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD)**, a process that degrades certain ER-targeted mRNAs to reduce the protein load entering the ER.

#### The PERK Pathway: Pausing and Adapting

PERK is structurally similar to IRE1, with a lumenal stress-sensing domain and a cytosolic kinase domain. Like IRE1, PERK activates via dimerization and [trans-autophosphorylation](@entry_id:172524) in response to ER stress. However, its primary substrate is not itself, but rather the $\alpha$ subunit of **[eukaryotic translation initiation](@entry_id:180943) factor 2 (eIF2$\alpha$)** [@problem_id:2828970].

The eIF2 complex is responsible for delivering the initiator methionyl-tRNA to the ribosome to start translation. Its activity is dependent on a GTP/GDP cycle, which is regulated by the guanine [nucleotide exchange factor](@entry_id:199424) (GEF) eIF2B. When PERK phosphorylates eIF2$\alpha$ on serine 51, it converts the eIF2 complex into a [competitive inhibitor](@entry_id:177514) of eIF2B. This severely curtails the recycling of active, GTP-bound eIF2, leading to a drastic reduction in the availability of the [ternary complex](@entry_id:174329) (eIF2-GTP-tRNAi) required for initiation. The immediate consequence is a global **attenuation of [protein synthesis](@entry_id:147414)**, which rapidly reduces the influx of new proteins into the stressed ER.

Paradoxically, this global shutdown of translation is accompanied by the selective upregulation of certain stress-response proteins, most notably the transcription factor **Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4)**. The ATF4 mRNA contains several short **upstream open reading frames (uORFs)** in its 5' untranslated region that regulate its translation. Under normal conditions (high [ternary complex](@entry_id:174329) levels), ribosomes translate an inhibitory uORF and fail to initiate at the main ATF4 coding sequence. However, under stress conditions (low [ternary complex](@entry_id:174329) levels), scanning ribosomes are more likely to bypass the inhibitory uORF start codon due to the delay in acquiring a [ternary complex](@entry_id:174329). This "[leaky scanning](@entry_id:168845)" allows them to reach and initiate at the main ATF4 start codon, leading to robust ATF4 synthesis. ATF4 then drives the expression of genes involved in [amino acid metabolism](@entry_id:174041), antioxidant responses, and, as we will see, apoptosis.

#### The ATF6 Pathway: A Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis Cascade

ATF6 is a type II [transmembrane protein](@entry_id:176217) that also resides in the ER and is regulated by BiP binding. Upon ER stress and its release from BiP, ATF6 is no longer retained in the ER and translocates to the Golgi apparatus. There, it is sequentially cleaved by **Site-1 Protease (S1P)** and **Site-2 Protease (S2P)**, the same proteases that regulate [cholesterol metabolism](@entry_id:166659). This [regulated intramembrane proteolysis](@entry_id:190230) liberates the N-terminal cytosolic domain of ATF6 (ATF6n), which is a potent transcription factor. ATF6n moves to the nucleus to induce the expression of genes encoding ER chaperones like BiP and components of the ER degradation machinery, complementing the transcriptional programs of XBP1s and ATF4 [@problem_id:2828956] [@problem_id:2828878].

### Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation (ERAD): Linking the UPR to the UPS

While the UPR aims to improve the folding environment, some proteins will inevitably fail to fold correctly. These terminally misfolded proteins must be eliminated from the ER to prevent their toxic accumulation. This is the role of **Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation (ERAD)**, a quality control pathway that recognizes, retro-translocates, ubiquitinates, and delivers misfolded ER proteins to the cytosolic proteasome for degradation [@problem_id:2828995]. ERAD is thus the critical link that couples the state of the ER lumen to the cytosolic UPS.

#### Substrate Recognition and the Glycan Code

A key challenge for ERAD is to distinguish terminally [misfolded proteins](@entry_id:192457), which must be destroyed, from transient folding intermediates, which should be given more time to fold. For many [glycoproteins](@entry_id:171189), this distinction is achieved through a sophisticated "[glycan code](@entry_id:185982)" that functions as a molecular timer [@problem_id:2828983].

Most proteins entering the ER are co-translationally modified with a pre-assembled oligosaccharide, $Glc_3Man_9GlcNAc_2$. Rapid trimming of the glucose residues by glucosidases generates a monoglucosylated glycan ($Glc_1Man_9GlcNAc_2$) that is recognized by the lectin chaperones **calnexin** and **[calreticulin](@entry_id:203302)**. These chaperones retain the glycoprotein in the ER and assist its folding. If the protein fails to fold, it is re-glucosylated by the enzyme UGGT1, which acts as a folding sensor, allowing it to re-enter the calnexin/[calreticulin](@entry_id:203302) cycle for another attempt.

This folding cycle competes with a slower, [irreversible process](@entry_id:144335): the trimming of mannose residues by ER mannosidases, such as **ERManI** and the **EDEM** family proteins. If a glycoprotein remains unfolded for a prolonged period, these enzymes will sequentially cleave specific $\alpha1,2$-linked mannose residues from the glycan. This trimming event eventually exposes an underlying $\alpha1,6$-linked mannose on the C-arm of the glycan tree. This specific structure serves as a terminal degradation signal, recognized with high affinity by ERAD-lectin adaptors such as **OS-9** and **XTP3-B**. These adaptors then deliver the condemned substrate to the core ERAD machinery.

#### Topological Specificity of ERAD

ERAD must be able to handle misfolded lesions regardless of their location within a protein. To achieve this, the machinery is organized into distinct branches that are specialized for the topology of the misfolded domain [@problem_id:2828995].

-   **ERAD-L** targets proteins with lesions in the ER **[lumen](@entry_id:173725)**. This pathway relies on lumenal recognition factors, such as the OS-9 lectin system described above, which link substrates to the core ERAD E3 ligase complex, centered on **Hrd1**.
-   **ERAD-M** targets proteins with lesions within their trans**membrane** domains. Here, the transmembrane helices of the Hrd1 E3 ligase itself and associated membrane proteins like the **Derlins** act as sensors, recognizing aberrant membrane helices and initiating their degradation.
-   **ERAD-C** targets ER-resident proteins with lesions in their **cytosolic** domains. In this case, recognition is handled by cytosolic quality control factors and dedicated ER-membrane-anchored E3 ligases, such as **Doa10** in yeast and its ortholog **MARCH6** in mammals.

#### The Extraction Step: The Role of p97/VCP

Regardless of the recognition mechanism, all ERAD substrates must ultimately be moved from the ER lumen or membrane into the cytosol to access the [proteasome](@entry_id:172113). This extraction of a polypeptide from a lipid bilayer is an energetically demanding process. The central player in this step is the cytosolic AAA$^{+}$ ATPase **p97** (also known as Valosin-Containing Protein, or VCP) [@problem_id:2828921].

After an ERAD E3 [ligase](@entry_id:139297) polyubiquitinates a substrate, the p97 complex is recruited to the ER membrane. Using its ubiquitin-binding cofactors, such as the **Ufd1-Npl4** heterodimer, p97 recognizes and binds to the ubiquitinated substrate. The hexameric p97 ring then harnesses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to exert a powerful mechanical force on the polypeptide, threading it through the central pore of the p97 ring and pulling it out of the ER membrane. This "segregase" activity effectively extracts the substrate into the cytosol. Once extracted, the unfolded polypeptide is handed off to the 26S [proteasome](@entry_id:172113), a process often facilitated by **UBL-UBA domain shuttle factors** (e.g., ubiquilins) that can simultaneously bind both ubiquitin and the proteasome. This intricate hand-off is further regulated by p97-associated DUBs, which can trim the [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) chain to promote release from p97 and efficient engagement with the proteasome.

### The Cell Fate Decision: Adaptation versus Apoptosis

The Unfolded Protein Response is fundamentally a pro-survival program. By attenuating protein synthesis and transcriptionally upregulating the machinery for protein folding and degradation, the UPR aims to restore ER [proteostasis](@entry_id:155284) and allow the cell to adapt to stress. This is the **adaptive phase** of the UPR.

However, if the ER stress is too severe or prolonged, these adaptive mechanisms may be insufficient to resolve the protein folding crisis. In this scenario, the UPR switches from a pro-survival to a pro-apoptotic program, initiating the **terminal phase** of the UPR and committing the cell to programmed cell death, or apoptosis [@problem_id:2828878]. This decision to live or die is a critical checkpoint in [cellular quality control](@entry_id:171073).

The switch to apoptosis is mediated by the sustained activation of specific UPR signaling outputs.
-   **Sustained PERK signaling** leads to high and prolonged expression of the transcription factor ATF4, which in turn drives the expression of **CHOP** (C/EBP homologous protein). CHOP is a key pro-apoptotic transcription factor that is thought to promote [cell death](@entry_id:169213) by downregulating the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and upregulating pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, tipping the balance of the BCL-2 family toward [cell death](@entry_id:169213).
-   **Sustained IRE1 signaling** can also become pro-apoptotic. Under chronic stress, the RNase activity may shift from adaptive XBP1 [splicing](@entry_id:261283) toward maladaptive RIDD, and IRE1 can also recruit signaling adaptors that lead to the activation of the **JNK** (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) stress pathway, which further promotes apoptosis.

Ultimately, these signals converge on the mitochondria, leading to [mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization](@entry_id:198355) (MOMP), the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of the caspase cascade that executes the apoptotic program. The commitment to apoptosis can thus be viewed as the cell's final quality control measure: when the internal damage caused by [proteostasis collapse](@entry_id:753826) is deemed irreparable, the organism is protected by the orderly elimination of the malfunctioning cell.
