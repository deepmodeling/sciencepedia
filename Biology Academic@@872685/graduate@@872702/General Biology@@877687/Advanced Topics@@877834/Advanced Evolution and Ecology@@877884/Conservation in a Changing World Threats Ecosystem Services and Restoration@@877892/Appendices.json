This exercise introduces the critical concepts of climate velocity and dispersal limitation, which are used to quantify the \"lag\" between environmental change and a species' ability to track it. By calculating this lag distance, we can gain insight into a population's vulnerability and the potential for an \"extinction debt\"—a future extinction that is already locked in by current demographic failures [@problem_id:2788830].", "problem": "A species must track a shifting climatic niche along a roughly linear elevational gradient. The rate of climatic shift along this gradient, known as climate velocity, is $20$ km per decade. The species’ dispersal along the same gradient can be summarized by a per-decade dispersal kernel with mean displacement $5$ km in the direction of the climatic shift. Assume decadal dispersal increments are independent and identically distributed with the same mean, and that over the time horizon considered the gradient is unidirectional and approximately linear so that expected displacements add across decades. Define lag distance after $50$ years as the difference between how far the climatic niche has shifted and the expected centroid displacement of the population due to dispersal over the same interval. Starting from the definitions of climate velocity and the linearity of expectation for sums of independent increments, compute this lag distance. Then, briefly explain how a persistent positive lag can generate extinction debt in long-lived populations under continued climatic shift and limited recruitment. Express the lag distance in kilometers as an exact value (no rounding).", "solution": "Let $V_c$ be the climate velocity. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$V_c = 20 \\text{ km/decade}$$\nLet $\\mu_d$ be the mean displacement of the species per decade due to dispersal. We are given:\n$$\\mu_d = 5 \\text{ km/decade}$$\nThe total time interval is $T = 50$ years. Since the rates are given per decade, we must convert the time interval to decades. Let $N$ be the number of decades.\n$$N = \\frac{50 \\text{ years}}{10 \\text{ years/decade}} = 5 \\text{ decades}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total distance the climatic niche has shifted over the interval of $N$ decades. The problem specifies a linear gradient and constant velocity, so the total shift, denoted $D_c$, is the product of the velocity and the time interval.\n$$D_c = V_c \\times N$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_c = (20 \\text{ km/decade}) \\times (5 \\text{ decades}) = 100 \\text{ km}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected total displacement of the population's centroid over the same interval. Let $X_i$ be the random variable representing the displacement of the population centroid during the $i$-th decade, for $i = 1, 2, ..., N$. The problem states that these increments are independent and identically distributed, with a mean $\\mu_d$.\n$$E[X_i] = \\mu_d = 5 \\text{ km}$$\nThe total displacement over $N$ decades is the sum of these individual displacements, $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$. We are asked for the expected total displacement, which we denote $D_p$. By the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations:\n$$D_p = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince the increments are identically distributed, $E[X_i]$ is the same for all $i$.\n$$D_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mu_d = N \\times \\mu_d$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_p = 5 \\text{ decades} \\times (5 \\text{ km/decade}) = 25 \\text{ km}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the lag distance, $L$, as defined in the problem statement: the difference between the niche shift and the expected population displacement.\n$$L = D_c - D_p$$\n$$L = 100 \\text{ km} - 25 \\text{ km} = 75 \\text{ km}$$\nThis is the lag distance after $50$ years.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an explanation of how a persistent positive lag generates extinction debt. A persistent positive lag, as calculated here, signifies that the population is consistently failing to track its shifting climatic niche. The core of the population remains in a location that is becoming increasingly unsuitable climatically.\n\nFor long-lived species, such as trees or large vertebrates, adult individuals can often survive for extended periods under suboptimal conditions. This persistence of adults can mask an underlying demographic failure. While the adult population appears stable, the deteriorating environmental conditions may entirely prevent successful reproduction or the survival of juvenile stages (recruitment failure). For example, a warming climate might prevent the chilling period required for seeds to germinate, or it might create conditions too dry for seedlings to establish, even while mature trees survive.\n\nThis situation creates an \"extinction debt.\" The debt is the future extinction of the population that is already demographically inevitable due to the lack of recruitment, even though the population currently persists. The present-day observation of a seemingly viable population of adults is misleading. Unless the lag can be closed—for instance, through a halt in climate change, human-assisted migration, or an unforeseen acceleration in natural dispersal—the population is fated to go extinct as the existing adult cohort senesces and dies without replacement. The final extinction is the \"payment\" of this debt, which was incurred decades or even centuries earlier when recruitment first failed due to the climate-dispersal lag.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{75}$$", "id": "2788830"}, {"introduction": "Beyond tracking large-scale climate shifts, species must navigate landscapes fragmented by human activity.

This problem delves into the stochastic nature of population dynamics using a continuous-time birth-death process, a fundamental model for assessing extinction risk when population sizes are low. By deriving the extinction probability from first principles, you will see how the simple balance between per capita birth ($\\lambda$) and death ($\\mu$) rates determines the ultimate success or failure of a conservation intervention [@problem_id:2788833].", "problem": "A conservation team reintroduces a threatened insect pollinator into a restored riparian corridor. Due to ongoing climatic stressors and habitat edge effects, the population dynamics at low density are well-approximated by a linear birth–death Markov branching process in continuous time: each individual independently produces a single new individual (birth) at per capita rate $\\lambda$ and dies at per capita rate $\\mu$, with no density dependence and no immigration. Let $N(t)$ denote the population size at time $t$, and suppose the process starts with $N(0)=N_0$ individuals.\n\nStarting only from foundational definitions for continuous-time Markov branching processes (independent and identically distributed individual life histories, the Markov property, and the branching property), derive the ultimate extinction probability as a function of $\\lambda$, $\\mu$, and $N_0$. Then evaluate it for $\\lambda=0.9$, $\\mu=1.1$, and $N_0=10$. Express the final probability as a pure number (no units). Provide an exact value; do not round.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the ultimate extinction probability for a continuous-time linear birth-death process starting with $N_0$ individuals. The derivation must originate from foundational principles.\n\nLet $N(t)$ denote the population size at time $t$. The process starts with $N(0)=N_0$ individuals. Each individual acts independently. For a single individual, a birth event occurs at rate $\\lambda$, increasing the population by one, and a death event occurs at rate $\\mu$, decreasing the population by one. The total time until the next event for a single individual is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate $\\lambda+\\mu$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the **branching property**: the lineages descending from the initial $N_0$ individuals are independent and statistically identical. Therefore, if we find the ultimate extinction probability, let us call it $q_{ext}$, for a process starting with a single individual ($N_0=1$), then the extinction probability for a process starting with $N_0$ individuals will be $(q_{ext})^{N_0}$. Our first objective is to compute $q_{ext}$.\n\nLet us consider a single lineage starting with $N(0)=1$. The first event will be either a birth or a death. The probability that the event is a birth is $p_{birth} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+\\mu}$. If a birth occurs, the population size becomes $2$. The probability that the event is a death is $p_{death} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda+\\mu}$. If a death occurs, the population size becomes $0$, and the lineage is extinct.\n\nThis formulation allows us to consider the embedded discrete-time generation process. Let $g(s)$ be the probability generating function (PGF) of the number of \"offspring\" after one event. An \"offspring\" count of $2$ occurs with probability $p_{birth}$, and an \"offspring\" count of $0$ occurs with probability $p_{death}$.\nThe PGF is therefore given by:\n$$ g(s) = p_{death} \\cdot s^0 + p_{birth} \\cdot s^2 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda+\\mu} + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+\\mu} s^2 = \\frac{\\mu + \\lambda s^2}{\\lambda+\\mu} $$\n\nA foundational result in branching process theory states that the ultimate extinction probability, $q_{ext}$, is the smallest non-negative root of the equation $g(s) = s$. Let us solve this equation for our process:\n$$ s = \\frac{\\mu + \\lambda s^2}{\\lambda+\\mu} $$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation for $s$:\n$$ s(\\lambda+\\mu) = \\mu + \\lambda s^2 $$\n$$ \\lambda s^2 - (\\lambda+\\mu)s + \\mu = 0 $$\n\nWe can find the roots of this quadratic equation. We observe that $s=1$ is always a root:\n$$ \\lambda (1)^2 - (\\lambda+\\mu)(1) + \\mu = \\lambda - \\lambda - \\mu + \\mu = 0 $$\nSince $s=1$ is a root, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of the polynomial. We can perform polynomial division or factor by inspection:\n$$ \\lambda s^2 - \\lambda s - \\mu s + \\mu = \\lambda s (s-1) - \\mu(s-1) = (\\lambda s - \\mu)(s-1) = 0 $$\nThe two roots of the equation $g(s)=s$ are therefore $s_1=1$ and $s_2=\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$.\n\nThe ultimate extinction probability $q_{ext}$ is the smallest non-negative root. We must compare the two roots, $1$ and $\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$.\n\nCase 1: Subcritical or critical process ($\\mu \\ge \\lambda$).\nIn this case, $\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} \\ge 1$. The smallest non-negative root is $s=1$. Thus, the extinction probability for a single lineage is $q_{ext}=1$. Extinction is certain.\n\nCase 2: Supercritical process ($\\mu < \\lambda$).\nIn this case, $0 < \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} < 1$. The smallest non-negative root is $s=\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$. Thus, the extinction probability for a single lineage is $q_{ext}=\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$. Extinction is not certain; there is a non-zero probability of survival.\n\nWe can combine these two cases into a single expression for the extinction probability of a single lineage:\n$$ q_{ext} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we return to the initial problem with $N(0)=N_0$ individuals. Because of the branching property asserting independence of lineages, the entire population goes extinct if and only if all $N_0$ independent lineages started by each of the initial individuals go extinct. The probability of this compound event is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ \\pi_{ext}(\\lambda, \\mu, N_0) = (q_{ext})^{N_0} = \\left( \\min\\left(1, \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right)^{N_0} $$\nThis is the general formula for the ultimate extinction probability.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression for the given parameters: $\\lambda=0.9$, $\\mu=1.1$, and $N_0=10$.\nFirst, we compare the rates $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$:\n$$ \\lambda = 0.9, \\quad \\mu = 1.1 $$\nSince $1.1 > 0.9$, we have $\\mu > \\lambda$. The process is subcritical.\nWe calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1.1}{0.9} = \\frac{11}{9} $$\nSince $\\frac{11}{9} > 1$, the extinction probability for a single lineage is:\n$$ q_{ext} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{11}{9}\\right) = 1 $$\nThe total extinction probability for the population starting with $N_0=10$ individuals is:\n$$ \\pi_{ext} = (q_{ext})^{N_0} = (1)^{10} = 1 $$\nThe probability of ultimate extinction for this population is exactly $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2788833"}]}
