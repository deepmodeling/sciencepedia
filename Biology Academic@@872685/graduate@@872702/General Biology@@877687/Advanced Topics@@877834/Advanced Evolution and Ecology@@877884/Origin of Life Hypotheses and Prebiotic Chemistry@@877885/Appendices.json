The values provided for the Gibbs free energy changes are realistic for peptide bond formation and the hydrolysis of a high-energy acyl compound. The scenario describes chemical coupling, a core concept in bioenergetics and prebiotic chemistry. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It asks for a standard calculation and a conceptual explanation based on established scientific principles. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem asks for two items: the calculation of the net standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{net}}$) for a coupled process, and a fundamental explanation of why such coupling is mechanistically necessary.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{net}}$. The overall process described is the synthesis of a dipeptide, $\\mathrm{GlyGly}$, from two molecules of glycine ($\\mathrm{Gly}$), driven by the concomitant hydrolysis of a high-energy compound, $\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}X}$. We can represent the overall transformation by constructing a net chemical equation from the two given reactions.\n\nThe reaction for dipeptide formation is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Gly} + \\mathrm{Gly} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{GlyGly} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\quad (\\mathrm{Reaction\\ A}) $$\nThis reaction is endergonic, with $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}} = +15\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nThe reaction for the hydrolysis of the energy-donating compound is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}X} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Acid} + \\mathrm{XH} \\quad (\\mathrm{Reaction\\ B}) $$\nThis reaction is exergonic, with $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{B}} = -30\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nThe coupled process involves both reactions occurring in a stoichiometric ratio of $1:1$. To find the net reaction, we sum the reactant and product sides of Reaction A and Reaction B:\n$$ (\\mathrm{Gly} + \\mathrm{Gly}) + (\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}X} + \\mathrm{H_2O}) \\rightleftharpoons (\\mathrm{GlyGly} + \\mathrm{H_2O}) + (\\mathrm{Acid} + \\mathrm{XH}) $$\nThe molecule $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ is a product of Reaction A but a reactant in Reaction B. In the net equation, it appears on both sides and can be canceled. This yields the net equation for the coupled process:\n$$ \\mathrm{Gly} + \\mathrm{Gly} + \\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}X} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{GlyGly} + \\mathrm{Acid} + \\mathrm{XH} $$\nGibbs free energy is a state function. This property allows us to apply Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy or free energy change for a reaction is the sum of the changes for the individual steps into which the reaction can be divided. Therefore, the net standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{net}}$, is the algebraic sum of the standard Gibbs free energy changes of the constituent reactions:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{B}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{net}} = (+15\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) + (-30\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{net}} = -15\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $-15\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $-15.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nSecond, we address the necessity of mechanistic coupling. The fact that the overall $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{net}}$ is negative ($-15.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$) indicates that the total process is thermodynamically favorable under standard conditions. However, this favorability does not manifest if the two reactions, A and B, merely coexist in the same solution without a specific mechanism linking them.\n\nIf uncoupled, Reaction A, with its positive $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}}$ of $+15\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, is non-spontaneous. The equilibrium constant $K_{eq} = \\exp(-\\Delta G^\\circ / (RT))$ for this reaction is much less than $1$, meaning the equilibrium strongly favors the reactants ($\\mathrm{Gly}$). The reaction will not proceed to any significant extent in the forward direction. Simultaneously, Reaction B, with its negative $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{B}}$ of $-30\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, is spontaneous and will proceed in the forward direction, releasing energy. In the absence of a coupling mechanism, this released energy is simply dissipated into the surrounding medium as heat, raising the temperature of the system. This thermal energy is disordered and cannot be specifically channeled to overcome the thermodynamic barrier of Reaction A.\n\nTrue thermodynamic driving requires a **mechanistic coupling**, which conserves the chemical potential energy from the exergonic reaction and applies it to the endergonic one. This is achieved by altering the reaction pathway through the formation of a **common, high-energy intermediate**. The problem statement alludes to such a mechanism where an activated acyl intermediate is formed. A plausible two-step pathway is:\n\n1.  **Activation:** The acyl group from $\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}X}$ is transferred to a reactive site, such as the amino group of a glycine molecule, forming an activated intermediate. For example: $\\mathrm{Gly} + \\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}X} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}Gly} + \\mathrm{XH}$. This step effectively captures the high energy of the $\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}X}$ bond in the new $\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}Gly}$ intermediate.\n2.  **Condensation:** The activated intermediate, $\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}Gly}$, reacts with a second glycine molecule to form the peptide bond: $\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}Gly} + \\mathrm{Gly} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{GlyGly} + \\mathrm{Acid}$.\n\nIn this new pathway, the original endergonic reaction (direct condensation of two glycine molecules) does not occur. Instead, it is replaced by a sequence of two different, more favorable reactions. The free energy from the hydrolysis of $\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}X}$ is not lost as heat but is conserved in the chemical bonds of the shared intermediate ($\\mathrm{Acyl\\text{-}Gly}$), making the subsequent formation of the peptide bond thermodynamically accessible. In essence, coupling does not involve the \"pushing\" of an unfavorable reaction; it involves replacing an unfavorable reaction with an entirely different, favorable reaction pathway that leads to the same net result. The additivity of Gibbs free energies according to Hess's law is a thermodynamic accounting tool that is only physically realized if there is a mechanistic pathway that connects the beginning and end states as a single, overall process.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-15.0} $$", "id": "2821335"}, {"introduction": "For life to begin, the replication of informational molecules must be sufficiently accurate to prevent the rapid degradation of function, a phenomenon known as an \"error catastrophe.\" This practice provides a quantitative link between fundamental thermodynamics and the fidelity of template-based copying.

A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe dynamics of a reacting species in one dimension are described by the reaction-diffusion equation, which combines Fick's second law with a reaction rate term. For reactant $A$, the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial [A]}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 [A]}{\\partial x^2} - R $$\nwhere $[A]$ is the concentration of $A$, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate across the film thickness, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $R$ is the rate of reaction.

We denote this common concentration as $c(x,t)$. The reaction term simplifies to $R = k c^2$. The governing partial differential equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - k c^2 $$\nTo non-dimensionalize this equation, we introduce the following dimensionless variables:\n- Dimensionless concentration: $\\theta = \\frac{c}{C}$, where $C$ is the initial concentration.\n- Dimensionless length: $\\xi = \\frac{x}{L}$, where $L$ is the film thickness.\n- Dimensionless time: $\\tau = \\frac{t}{\\tau_{char}}$, where $\\tau_{char}$ is a characteristic time.
