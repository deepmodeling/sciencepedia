It is a standard application of fundamental principles of transport phenomena. I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the steady-state flux, $J$, of a neutral solute across a membrane. The starting point is Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension, which we take along the $x$-axis, perpendicular to the membrane surface.\n$$J(x) = -D_{m} \\frac{dC_{m}(x)}{dx}$$\nIn this equation, $D_{m}$ is the diffusion coefficient of the solute within the membrane, and $C_{m}(x)$ is the concentration of the solute within the membrane at position $x$. We set the boundaries of the membrane at $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n\nThe condition of \"steady state\" implies that the flux $J$ is constant with respect to both time and position within the membrane. Therefore, $J(x)$ is a constant, which we shall simply call $J$.\n$$J = -D_{m} \\frac{dC_{m}}{dx}$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $C_{m}(x)$. We can solve for $J$ by separating variables and integrating across the entire thickness of the membrane, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The corresponding concentrations at these boundaries are $C_{m}(0)$ and $C_{m}(L)$.\n$$J \\int_{0}^{L} dx = -D_{m} \\int_{C_{m}(0)}^{C_{m}(L)} dC_{m}$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$J \\cdot L = -D_{m} [C_{m}(L) - C_{m}(0)]$$\n$$J = \\frac{D_{m}}{L} [C_{m}(0) - C_{m}(L)]$$\nThis expression gives the flux in terms of the solute concentrations just inside the membrane at the interfaces. The problem provides aqueous concentrations, not membrane concentrations.\n\nThe assumption of \"instantaneous partition equilibrium\" provides the connection. The partition coefficient, $K$, relates the concentration of the solute just inside the membrane, $C_m$, to the concentration in the adjacent aqueous phase, $c_{aq}$.\n$$K = \\frac{C_m(\\text{interface})}{c_{aq}(\\text{interface})}$$\nLet the high concentration side be at $x=0$ and the low concentration side at $x=L$.

As $c_{\\text{high}}  c_{\\text{low}}$, $\\Delta c  0$, and all other parameters ($K, D_m, L$) are positive, our derived flux $J$ is indeed positive, which is consistent.\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value for $J$.

It presents a standard exercise in modeling carrier-mediated membrane transport kinetics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the net flux density, $J$, based on a four-state, symmetric, alternating-access model for a uniporter.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the flux equation.\n\nLet the four states of the carrier be: $E_o$ (empty, facing out), $E_i$ (empty, facing in), $ES_o$ (substrate-bound, facing out), and $ES_i$ (substrate-bound, facing in). Let their respective concentrations per unit membrane area be $[E_o]$, $[E_i]$, $[ES_o]$, and $[ES_i]$. The total carrier concentration, $C_T$, is conserved:\n$$C_T = [E_o] + [E_i] + [ES_o] + [ES_i]$$\nThe kinetic scheme, incorporating the symmetry assumption where corresponding rate constants are equal, is:\n1. Substrate binding/unbinding on the outside: $E_o + S_o \\underset{k_{off}}{\\stackrel{k_{on}c_o}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES_o$\n2. Loaded carrier translocation: $ES_o \\underset{k_p}{\\stackrel{k_p}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES_i$\n3. Substrate binding/unbinding on the inside: $E_i + S_i \\underset{k_{on}c_i}{\\stackrel{k_{off}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES_i$\n4. Empty carrier translocation: $E_i \\underset{k_e}{\\stackrel{k_e}{\\rightleftharpoons}} E_o$\n\nHere, $k_{on}$ is the second-order association rate constant, $k_{off}$ is the first-order dissociation rate constant, and $k_p$ and $k_e$ are the first-order rate constants for the translocation of the loaded and empty carrier, respectively. The substrate dissociation constant is $K_d = k_{off}/k_{on}$.\n\nThe steady-state rate equations for the concentrations of the four states are:\n$$\\frac{d[E_o]}{dt} = k_{off}[ES_o] + k_e[E_i] - (k_{on}c_o + k_e)[E_o] = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d[E_i]}{dt} = k_{off}[ES_i] + k_e[E_o] - (k_{on}c_i + k_e)[E_i] = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d[ES_o]}{dt} = k_{on}c_o[E_o] + k_p[ES_i] - (k_{off} + k_p)[ES_o] = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d[ES_i]}{dt} = k_{on}c_i[E_i] + k_p[ES_o] - (k_{off} + k_p)[ES_i] = 0$$\n\nThe net influx of substrate, $J$, is the net rate of translocation of the loaded carrier from outside to inside:\n$$J = k_p[ES_o] - k_p[ES_i]$$\nAt steady state, the net translocation of carriers across the membrane must be zero. The total number of carriers moving from out to in must equal the total number moving from in to out:\n$$k_e[E_o] + k_p[ES_o] = k_e[E_i] + k_p[ES_i]$$\nRearranging this gives $k_p([ES_o] - [ES_i]) = k_e([E_i] - [E_o])$, which implies:\n$$J = k_e([E_i] - [E_o])$$\n\nSolving the full system of equations is algebraically intensive. However, the structure of the data provided in Task 3 suggests a simplified form of the rate law, which arises from specific limiting assumptions that are physically plausible. Specifically, the data perfectly fit a linear model that is derived from the case where translocation of the empty carrier is very fast compared to other steps ($k_e \\to \\infty$) and the binding/unbinding reactions are in rapid equilibrium ($k_{on}, k_{off} \\gg k_p, k_e$). I shall proceed with the derivation under these assumptions, as it is the only way to reconcile the theoretical model with the provided data.\n\nAssumption 1: Fast empty carrier reorientation ($k_e \\to \\infty$).\nFor the flux $J = k_e([E_i] - [E_o])$ to remain finite, the term $([E_i] - [E_o])$ must approach zero. Thus, this assumption implies that the empty carrier states are always in equilibrium across the membrane:\n$$[E_i] = [E_o]$$\n\nAssumption 2: Rapid binding/unbinding equilibrium.\nThis assumption implies that the binding/unbinding steps are much faster than the translocation steps. The substrate-bound carrier concentrations are thus determined by a quasi-equilibrium condition with the unbound forms:\n$$[ES_o] = \\frac{k_{on}c_o}{k_{off}}[E_o] = \\frac{c_o}{K_d}[E_o]$$\n$$[ES_i] = \\frac{k_{on}c_i}{k_{off}}[E_i] = \\frac{c_i}{K_d}[E_i]$$\nwhere $K_d = k_{off}/k_{on}$ is the substrate dissociation constant.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for flux $J$ under these conditions. The flux is governed by the rate-limiting translocation of the loaded carrier:\n$$J = k_p([ES_o] - [ES_i])$$\nSubstituting the equilibrium relations and $[E_i] = [E_o]$:\n$$J = k_p \\left( \\frac{c_o}{K_d}[E_o] - \\frac{c_i}{K_d}[E_i] \\right) = \\frac{k_p}{K_d}(c_o - c_i)[E_o]$$\nTo find $[E_o]$, we use the conservation of total carrier concentration, $C_T$:\n$$C_T = [E_o] + [E_i] + [ES_o] + [ES_i]$$\nSubstituting the simplified relations:\n$$C_T = [E_o] + [E_o] + \\frac{c_o}{K_d}[E_o] + \\frac{c_i}{K_d}[E_o] = [E_o] \\left( 2 + \\frac{c_o+c_i}{K_d} \\right)$$\nSolving for $[E_o]$:\n$$[E_o] = \\frac{C_T}{2 + \\frac{c_o+c_i}{K_d}}$$\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $J$:\n$$J = \\frac{k_p}{K_d}(c_o-c_i) \\frac{C_T}{2 + \\frac{c_o+c_i}{K_d}} = \\frac{C_T k_p (c_o-c_i)}{2K_d + c_o + c_i}$$\nThis expression must be formulated in terms of a maximal flux, $V_{\\max}$, and a Michaelis constant, $K_m$. We define $V_{\\max}$ as the saturating unidirectional flux (e.g., when $c_i=0$ and $c_o \\to \\infty$):\n$$V_{\\max} = \\lim_{c_o \\to \\infty} J(c_o, 0) = \\lim_{c_o \\to \\infty} \\frac{C_T k_p c_o}{2K_d + c_o} = C_T k_p$$\nThe Michaelis constant $K_m$ is typically defined as the substrate concentration at which the unidirectional flux is half-maximal.\n$$J(K_m, 0) = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{2} \\implies \\frac{C_T k_p K_m}{2K_d + K_m} = \\frac{C_T k_p}{2}$$\n$$2K_m = 2K_d + K_m \\implies K_m = 2K_d$$\nSubstituting $V_{\\max}$ and $K_m$ into the derived flux equation yields the final form for Task 1:\n$$J = \\frac{V_{\\max}(c_o - c_i)}{K_m + c_o + c_i}$$\n\nStep 2: Derivation of a linear relationship.\n\nTo determine the parameters $V_{\\max}$ and $K_m$ from experimental data, we rearrange the flux equation into a linear form.\n$$J(K_m + c_o + c_i) = V_{\\max}(c_o - c_i)$$\nDividing by $J \\cdot V_{\\max}$:\n$$\\frac{K_m + c_o + c_i}{V_{\\max}} = \\frac{c_o - c_i}{J}$$\nRearranging to match the form $y = mx+c$:\n$$\\frac{c_o - c_i}{J} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}(c_o + c_i) + \\frac{K_m}{V_{\\max}}$$\nThis equation is linear. If we define $Y = \\frac{c_o - c_i}{J}$ and $X = c_o + c_i$, we have the linear relationship $Y = mX + c$, where the slope is $m = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}$ and the Y-intercept is $c = \\frac{K_m}{V_{\\max}}$. The kinetic parameters can be determined from the slope and intercept of a linear fit to the data:\n$$V_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{m}$$\n$$K_m = \\frac{c}{m} = c \\cdot V_{\\max}$$\n\nStep 3: Estimation of parameters and analysis of symmetry.\n\nWe transform the given data points $(c_i, c_o; J)$ into $(X, Y)$ coordinates, where $X=c_o+c_i$ and $Y=(c_o-c_i)/J$.\n1.

The transformed points are $(4.0, 6.0)$, $(6.0, 8.0)$, $(7.0, 9.0)$. These points also lie perfectly on the line $Y=X+2$.

Thus, for this subset, $m=1$ and $c=2$, yielding $V_{\\max}=1.0$ and $K_m=2.0$.\n\nThe kinetic parameters estimated from the influx and efflux data subsets are identical.
