A narrow rectangular strip of width $w$ along the spindle axis is bleached across many parallel kinetochore fibers. The measured FRAP recovery curve, averaged over the bleached strip, is well fit by a single-exponential approach to a plateau with half-time $t_{1/2}$. An independent speckle-based measurement of spindle poleward flux gives a mean lattice advection speed $v_{f}$ toward the spindle poles along microtubules. The mobile fraction is $f_{m}$, but you may assume that the mobile fraction affects only the recovery amplitude and not the recovery rate constant.\n\nAdopt the following assumptions, which are standard for this system:\n- Cytosolic unpolymerized tubulin is well mixed on the time scale of the observed recovery, so the recovery kinetics are limited by microtubule lattice turnover and lattice advection, not by diffusion.\n- Two independent first-order processes contribute to FRAP recovery within the bleached strip: (i) molecular exchange at microtubule ends that replaces bleached lattice with newly polymerized fluorescent lattice with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, and (ii) advective replacement due to poleward flux that sweeps bleached lattice out of the strip with an effective first-order rate constant equal to the rate at which advection traverses the strip width.\n- Photobleach depth is homogeneous across the strip, photodamage is negligible, and microtubule density is approximately uniform within the strip.\n\nStarting only from these premises and basic first-order kinetics, derive a compact expression for the molecular exchange rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ in terms of the measured half-time $t_{1/2}$, the strip width $w$, and the poleward flux speed $v_{f}$, and then compute its numerical value for\n- $t_{1/2} = 14.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$,\n- $w = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$,\n- $v_{f} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m\\,min^{-1}}$.\n\nExpress your final numerical answer for $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n\nIn addition, in your reasoning, make clear how the exchange rate constant you compute conceptually relates to poleward flux and to the standard two-state dynamic instability parameters at microtubule plus-ends (growth velocity $v_{g}$, shrinkage velocity $v_{s}$, catastrophe frequency $f_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, and rescue frequency $f_{\\mathrm{res}}$).

The provided numerical values are physically realistic for mammalian cell spindles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid**. A solution will be furnished.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem states that the fluorescence recovery within the bleached strip is governed by two independent, first-order processes. In kinetics, when multiple independent first-order processes contribute to an overall rate, the total observed rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of the individual rate constants.\n\nLet the two processes be:\n1.  Molecular exchange, characterized by the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.\n2.  Advective replacement due to poleward flux, characterized by the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{adv}}$.\n\nThus, the total rate constant is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{total}} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}} + k_{\\mathrm{adv}}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the advective replacement has an \"effective first-order rate constant equal to the rate at which advection traverses the strip width.\" A rate is the inverse of a characteristic time. The characteristic time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{adv}}$, for the lattice moving at speed $v_{f}$ to completely traverse the strip of width $w$ is given by:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{adv}} = \\frac{w}{v_{f}}$$\nTherefore, the corresponding first-order rate constant for advection is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{adv}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{adv}}} = \\frac{v_{f}}{w}$$\n\nThe total recovery process is observed to follow a single-exponential time course with a half-time $t_{1/2}$. The relationship between the rate constant of a first-order process and its half-time is fundamental:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for $k_{\\mathrm{total}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{adv}}$ into the summation equation, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}} + \\frac{v_{f}}{w}$$\n\nWe are tasked with deriving an expression for the molecular exchange rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. Rearranging the equation yields the desired expression:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} - \\frac{v_{f}}{w}$$\n\nThis equation separates the contribution of intrinsic microtubule turnover ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) from the contribution of bulk lattice movement ($k_{\\mathrm{adv}}$) to the overall measured FRAP kinetics.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ using the provided data:\n-   $t_{1/2} = 14.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n-   $w = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n-   $v_{f} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m\\,min^{-1}}$\n\nTo maintain consistent units for a result in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, the poleward flux speed $v_{f}$ must be converted from $\\mathrm{\\mu m\\,min^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{\\mu m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n$$v_{f} = 1.5\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{min}}{60\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the two terms in the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$:\nThe total rate constant from the FRAP half-time is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{14.0\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\approx \\frac{0.69315}{14.0}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 0.04951\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe advective rate constant is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{adv}} = \\frac{v_{f}}{w} = \\frac{0.025\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m\\,s^{-1}}}{1.8\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}} \\approx 0.01389\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_{\\mathrm{total}} - k_{\\mathrm{adv}} \\approx (0.04951 - 0.01389)\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.03562\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx 0.0356\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\n**Conceptual Relationship to Dynamic Instability**\n\nThe analysis correctly separates the macroscopic observables into two components: advection ($v_f$) and molecular exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$).\n- **Poleward Flux ($v_f$)**: This is the coherent, directional movement of the entire microtubule polymer lattice toward the spindle poles. It is a bulk transport phenomenon. The rate $k_{\\mathrm{adv}} = v_f/w$ represents fluorescence recovery simply because bleached polymer is physically swept out of the observation zone and replaced by fluorescent polymer that was previously outside the zone.\n- **Molecular Exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$)**: This constant represents the intrinsic turnover of tubulin subunits *within* a stationary segment of the microtubule lattice. It reflects the process by which a bleached tubulin dimer, incorporated into the polymer, is eventually lost from the lattice and replaced by a new, fluorescent tubulin dimer from the soluble pool.\n\nThe physical mechanism underlying this molecular exchange is **dynamic instability** at the microtubule plus-ends (the ends distal to the spindle pole). Dynamic instability is the stochastic switching between phases of polymerization (growth) and depolymerization (shrinkage). This process is characterized by four primary parameters:\n-   Growth velocity ($v_g$)\n-   Shrinkage velocity ($v_s$)\n-   Catastrophe frequency ($f_{\\mathrm{cat}}$: the rate of switching from growth to shrinkage)\n-   Rescue frequency ($f_{\\mathrm{res}}$: the rate of switching from shrinkage to growth)\n\nThe constant $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is the macroscopic rate constant that emerges from these microscopic, stochastic events. A bleached subunit at a certain position in the lattice is replaced when the microtubule end depolymerizes past that position and subsequently re-grows through it. The characteristic time for this turnover to occur, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, is therefore a function of the dynamic instability parameters. A higher shrinkage velocity ($v_s$) or a higher catastrophe frequency ($f_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) would lead to more frequent and extensive depolymerization events, accelerating the replacement of subunits and thus increasing $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. Conversely, a higher rescue frequency ($f_{\\mathrm{res}}$) would curtail shrinkage events, stabilizing the lattice, leading to slower turnover and a smaller $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.\n\nIn summary, the FRAP experiment measures a total kinetic rate, $k_{\\mathrm{total}}$. By independently measuring the contribution from bulk transport ($k_{\\mathrm{adv}}$), one can isolate $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, which is a direct measure of the rate of polymer renewal driven by the dynamic instability of microtubule ends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0356}$$", "id": "2817955"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its structural dynamics, the spindle's primary function is to generate and respond to forces that segregate chromosomes.

It is deemed **valid**.

We shall analyze the forces acting on the contractile ring of instantaneous radius $R$. The direction of constriction, radially inward, is taken as positive.\n\nFirst, we identify the driving force. The actomyosin ring possesses a line tension $\\lambda$, which has units of force. This tension generates an inward contractile force. A rigorous way to determine this force is to consider the work done during constriction. If the radius of the ring changes by an infinitesimal amount $dR$, the circumference $L = 2\\pi R$ changes by $dL = 2\\pi dR$. The work done by the line tension is given by $dW_{ring} = \\lambda(-dL) = \\lambda(-2\\pi dR)$, where the negative sign indicates that a decrease in length (constriction) corresponds to positive work done by the tension. By definition, work is also $dW_{ring} = F_{ring}(-dR)$. Comparing the two expressions for work, we identify the total inward-directed driving force as:\n$$\nF_{drive} = 2\\pi\\lambda\n$$\nThis driving force is constant, independent of the radius $R$.\n\nNext, we identify the resistive forces that oppose a decrease in $R$.\n\n1.  Membrane Tension Resistance, $F_{mem}$: The plasma membrane has an effective in-plane tension $\\gamma$, with units of force per length. This tension opposes the deformation caused by the constricting ring. This resistive force can be modeled as acting along the entire circumference of the furrow, pulling radially outward. The total magnitude of this force is the tension $\\gamma$ multiplied by the circumference $2\\pi R$:\n    $$\n    F_{mem} = \\gamma (2\\pi R) = 2\\pi\\gamma R\n    $$\n\n2.  Viscous Shear Resistance, $F_{visc}$: The cytoplasm is a Newtonian fluid of viscosity $\\eta$. As the ring constricts at speed $v = -dR/dt$, it shears the adjacent cytoplasm. The problem states that the dominant viscous dissipation arises from shearing an annular area proportional to the ring circumference. The viscous drag force in a low Reynolds number regime is generally proportional to the viscosity, the velocity, and a characteristic length scale of the object. Here, the object is the ring, with characteristic length being its radius $R$ or circumference $2\\pi R$. Therefore, the viscous force must be of the form $F_{visc} \\propto \\eta v R$.

We examine the ratio of the two resistive forces:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{visc}}{F_{mem}} = \\frac{k \\eta v R}{2\\pi\\gamma R} = \\frac{k \\eta v}{2\\pi\\gamma}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v(R)$:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{visc}}{F_{mem}} = \\frac{k \\eta}{2\\pi\\gamma} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi(\\lambda - \\gamma R)}{k \\eta R} \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda - \\gamma R}{\\gamma R} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\gamma R} - 1\n$$\nUsing our result for the critical radius, we can write $\\lambda = 2\\gamma R_c$. Substituting this into the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{visc}}{F_{mem}} = \\frac{2\\gamma R_c}{\\gamma R} - 1 = \\frac{2R_c}{R} - 1\n$$\nNow we analyze the limiting cases:\n-   For $R \\ll R_c$, the ratio $R_c/R$ becomes very large. Thus, $F_{visc}/F_{mem} \\gg 1$. In this regime, the viscous shear resistance is the dominant opposing force.\n-   For $R \\gg R_c$ (specifically, in the range $R_c < R < 2R_c$ where constriction still occurs), the ratio $R_c/R$ is less than $1$. As $R$ approaches the stall radius $2R_c$, the ratio approaches $0$. Thus, $F_{visc}/F_{mem} < 1$. In this regime, the membrane tension resistance is the dominant opposing force.\n\nThe problem requires a single analytic expression for $R_c$ as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\gamma}}$$", "id": "2817907"}]}
