Using only foundational definitions from the central dogma and macromolecular enzymology, derive from first principles an exact expression for the total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed by this single round, under the following explicit assumptions that reflect well-established biochemical steps:\n\n- Aminoacylation (charging) of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases consumes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) plus inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which corresponds to $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents per amino acid charged.\n- Translational elongation on the ribosome consumes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for each elongation cycle: $1$ GTP for aminoacyl-tRNA delivery and $1$ GTP for translocation per peptide bond formed, for a total of $2$ GTP per peptide bond. Count each GTP hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) as $1$ high-energy phosphate equivalent.\n- Transcription by RNA polymerase consumes one nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) per phosphodiester bond formed. For an RNA of length $m$ nucleotides, there are $m-1$ such bonds; for each bond, cleavage of the incoming NTP to nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) plus PPi breaks one phosphoanhydride bond, and subsequent hydrolysis of PPi to two inorganic phosphates breaks a second high-energy bond. Thus, count $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents per phosphodiester bond formed.\n- Ignore all costs of initiation, termination, proofreading, quality control, mRNA processing (such as capping and polyadenylation), degradation, ribosome assembly, and any other overhead not explicitly listed above.\n\nCompute the total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed to produce exactly one $3000$-nucleotide mRNA and one $1000$-amino-acid protein from it.

It provides a set of clear, explicit assumptions and sufficient data to derive a unique, exact solution from first principles of molecular biology and biochemistry. The problem reduces to a straightforward calculation based on the provided bioenergetic costs for transcription and translation. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed, which we will denote as $E_{total}$, is the sum of the energy consumed during transcription ($E_{transcription}$) and translation ($E_{translation}$).\n$$E_{total} = E_{transcription} + E_{translation}$$\n\nFirst, we will calculate the energy cost of transcription.\nThe synthesis of a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule of length $m$ nucleotides requires the formation of $m-1$ phosphodiester bonds. The problem specifies that the length of the mRNA is $m = 3000$ nucleotides. Therefore, the number of phosphodiester bonds formed is $3000 - 1 = 2999$.\nAccording to the provided assumptions, the formation of each phosphodiester bond consumes $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents. This accounts for the cleavage of a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to a nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), followed by the hydrolysis of PPi.\nThe total energy cost for transcription is therefore:\n$$E_{transcription} = (m-1) \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $m=3000$:\n$$E_{transcription} = (3000 - 1) \\times 2 = 2999 \\times 2 = 5998$$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy cost of translation, $E_{translation}$. This process, under the given constraints, consists of two distinct energetic costs: the charging of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules (aminoacylation), and the elongation of the polypeptide chain on the ribosome.\n$$E_{translation} = E_{aminoacylation} + E_{elongation}$$\n\nThe cost of aminoacylation, $E_{aminoacylation}$, is the energy required to attach each amino acid to its corresponding tRNA. The protein to be synthesized has a length of $n = 1000$ amino acids. Each of these $1000$ amino acids must be \"charged\" or activated. The problem states that charging one tRNA molecule consumes ATP, yielding AMP and PPi, which is equivalent to the hydrolysis of two phosphoanhydride bonds, or $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents per amino acid.\nThe total cost for aminoacylation is:\n$$E_{aminoacylation} = n \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $n=1000$:\n$$E_{aminoacylation} = 1000 \\times 2 = 2000$$\n\nThe cost of elongation, $E_{elongation}$, is associated with the formation of peptide bonds. A protein of length $n$ amino acids contains $n-1$ peptide bonds. For a protein of $1000$ amino acids, this is $1000 - 1 = 999$ peptide bonds.\nThe problem states that each elongation cycle, which forms one peptide bond, consumes $2$ molecules of GTP. One GTP is used for the delivery of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome, and a second GTP is used for the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA. Each GTP hydrolyzed to GDP is counted as $1$ high-energy phosphate equivalent. Thus, the formation of one peptide bond costs $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents.\nThe total cost for elongation is:\n$$E_{elongation} = (n-1) \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $n=1000$:\n$$E_{elongation} = (1000 - 1) \\times 2 = 999 \\times 2 = 1998$$\n\nFinally, we sum these individual costs to find the total energy consumption for this single round of gene expression.\n$$E_{total} = E_{transcription} + E_{aminoacylation} + E_{elongation}$$\n$$E_{total} = 5998 + 2000 + 1998$$\n$$E_{total} = 7998 + 1998 = 9996$$\n\nAlternatively, we can construct a general formula from the symbolic expressions:\n$$E_{total} = 2(m-1) + 2n + 2(n-1)$$\n$$E_{total} = 2m - 2 + 2n + 2n - 2$$\n$$E_{total} = 2m + 4n - 4$$\nSubstituting the given values $m=3000$ and $n=1000$:\n$$E_{total} = 2(3000) + 4(1000) - 4$$\n$$E_{total} = 6000 + 4000 - 4$$\n$$E_{total} = 10000 - 4 = 9996$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed is $9996$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9996}$$", "id": "2842316"}, {"introduction": "Gene expression is not merely a fixed pipeline but a dynamically regulated process that allows cells to respond to their environment.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the exact steady-state probability distribution $p(k)$ for the copy number $k$ of a protein, described by a one-step birth-death process. The state of the system is the integer protein count $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The transitions between states are governed by the following propensities:\n- Birth: A transition from state $k$ to $k+1$ occurs with rate $b_k = \\frac{r_{\\max}}{1 + (k/K)^n}$.
