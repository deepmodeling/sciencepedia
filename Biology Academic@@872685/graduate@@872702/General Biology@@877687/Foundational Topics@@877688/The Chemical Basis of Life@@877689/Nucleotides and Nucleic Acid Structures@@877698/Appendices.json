If a DNA polymerase encounters a template base in its rare tautomeric form during replication, it may mistakenly incorporate a non-complementary nucleotide, leading to a point mutation. The fraction $f_{\\text{rare}}$ represents the proportion of bases that exist in this miscoding state at any given moment due to thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus, $f_{\\text{rare}} \\approx 10^{-5}$ sets a fundamental thermodynamic upper bound on the error frequency for DNA replication driven solely by base tautomerism. The fact that the observed mutation rates in living organisms are many orders of magnitude lower (e.g., $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-10}$ per base pair) demonstrates that biological systems have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to overcome this thermodynamic limit. These mechanisms include kinetic discrimination by the DNA polymerase active site, which can reject mismatched pairs, and post-replicative mismatch repair systems that identify and correct errors after the polymerase has moved on.
