The effective molarity of $PI(4,5)P_2$ is $10.22\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, which is in the millimolar range. The fractional occupancy of the PH domain by $PI(4,5)P_2$ is $\\approx 0.9997$, which is essentially unity. The conclusion correctly follows from these facts.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Because $K_d^{\\mathrm{PH\\text{-}IP3}}$ is smaller than $K_d^{\\mathrm{PH\\text{-}PIP2}}$, at $[\\text{IP}_3] = 0.50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ the PH domain will preferentially bind IP3 over $PI(4,5)P_2$ and act as the primary cytosolic IP3 sensor.\n- This reasoning is flawed. While $K_d^{\\mathrm{PH\\text{-}IP3}} (0.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})$ is indeed smaller than $K_d^{\\mathrm{PH\\text{-}PIP2}} (1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})$, binding preference depends on the ratio $[L]/K_d$, not on $K_d$ alone. The immense effective concentration of $PI(4,5)P_2$ makes the term $([\\text{PI}(4,5)\\text{P}_2]_{\\text{eff}})/K_d^{\\mathrm{PH\\text{-}PIP2}} \\approx 10220$, which vastly exceeds the term $([\\text{IP}_3])/K_d^{\\mathrm{PH\\text{-}IP3}} = 2.5$. The PH domain overwhelmingly prefers $PI(4,5)P_2$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. The two-dimensional nature of $PI(4,5)P_2$ reduces its effective concentration below $1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, so most PH domains are cytosolic at rest and will rapidly bind IP3 when it is produced.\n- This statement is factually wrong. Confinement to a 2D surface, when converted to an effective 3D concentration in an adjacent thin layer, *increases* the effective concentration dramatically. Our calculation shows it is $\\approx 10.22\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, many orders of magnitude greater than $1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. Consequently, PH domains are membrane-bound at rest, not cytosolic.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. IP3 is hydrophobic and membrane-confined, so it does not reach the ER to bind IP3R efficiently; therefore PH domains at the plasma membrane are better positioned to sense IP3.\n- This statement rests on a false premise. $IP_3$ (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) is a small, polyanionic, highly water-soluble sugar phosphate. It is the diacylglycerol (DAG) produced alongside $IP_3$ that is hydrophobic and remains in the membrane. $IP_3$ diffuses freely through the aqueous cytosol to reach its receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. The preference of PH domains for $PI(4,5)P_2$ over IP3 in cells arises from high effective $PI(4,5)P_2$ concentration and dimensionality-reduced search at the membrane, whereas IP3R samples three-dimensional cytosolic IP3 and, with submicromolar $K_d$, achieves high occupancy during physiological IP3 spikes; this explains why IP3R, not PH domains, is the operative IP3 sensor for calcium release signaling.\n- This statement provides a comprehensive and accurate conceptual summary. It correctly identifies the high effective concentration of $PI(4,5)P_2$ as the key factor for PH domain preference. It correctly characterizes the IP3R as a sensor that has a suitably low (submicromolar) $K_d$ to respond potently to cytosolic $IP_3$ transients. The mention of \"dimensionality-reduced search\" is a valid kinetic concept that further reinforces the strong membrane localization of the PH domain, although the conclusion can be reached from equilibrium arguments alone. The overall explanation is sound and consistent with our quantitative analysis.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2586225"}]}
