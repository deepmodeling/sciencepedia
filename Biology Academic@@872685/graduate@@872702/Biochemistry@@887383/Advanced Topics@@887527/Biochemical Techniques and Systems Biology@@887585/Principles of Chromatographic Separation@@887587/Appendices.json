The definitions for plate height, $H$, and plate number, $N$, are standard. The use of a Gaussian model for peak shape is a common and valid approximation. The linear relationship $x = u\\,t$ is a correct assumption for ideal chromatography. A minor imprecision exists in the descriptive text for baseline width (\"width between the points where the Gaussian returns to baseline\"), as a true Gaussian function only asymptotically approaches the baseline. However, the problem immediately rectifies this by providing the explicit, quantitative definition $w_{b} = 4\\,\\sigma_{t}$, which is the standard convention in the field. This makes the problem well-posed and unambiguous. The provided data are complete, consistent, and physically realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to find the plate number, $N$. We begin with the provided definitions:\n$$N = \\frac{L}{H}$$\n$$H = \\frac{\\sigma_{x}^{2}}{L}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H$ into the expression for $N$ yields an alternative formula for the plate number in terms of the column length $L$ and the spatial variance $\\sigma_{x}^{2}$:\n$$N = \\frac{L}{(\\sigma_{x}^{2}/L)} = \\frac{L^{2}}{\\sigma_{x}^{2}}$$\nThis equation expresses $N$ using variance in the spatial domain (units of length squared). The measured quantity, $w_{b}$, is in the time domain. A transformation between these domains is required. The problem states the relationship between the spatial coordinate $x$ and the time coordinate $t$ is linear:\n$$x = u\\,t$$\nwhere $u$ is the constant linear velocity. For a distribution described by a random variable, this linear transformation relates the variances in the two domains as follows:\n$$\\sigma_{x}^{2} = \\mathrm{Var}(x) = \\mathrm{Var}(u\\,t) = u^{2}\\mathrm{Var}(t) = u^{2}\\sigma_{t}^{2}$$\nNow, we must relate the temporal variance, $\\sigma_{t}^{2}$, to the given observable, $w_{b}$. The problem specifies the relationship for a Gaussian peak:\n$$w_{b} = 4\\,\\sigma_{t}$$\nFrom this, we solve for the temporal standard deviation, $\\sigma_{t}$, and the temporal variance, $\\sigma_{t}^{2}$:\n$$\\sigma_{t} = \\frac{w_{b}}{4}$$\n$$\\sigma_{t}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{w_{b}}{4}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{w_{b}^{2}}{16}$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $\\sigma_{t}^{2}$ into our equation relating spatial and temporal variances:\n$$\\sigma_{x}^{2} = u^{2} \\left(\\frac{w_{b}^{2}}{16}\\right) = \\frac{u^{2}w_{b}^{2}}{16}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the spatial variance $\\sigma_{x}^{2}$ into our equation for the plate number $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{L^{2}}{\\sigma_{x}^{2}} = \\frac{L^{2}}{(u^{2}w_{b}^{2}/16)}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the desired relationship for $N$ in terms of $L$, $u$, and $w_{b}$:\n$$N = 16\\left(\\frac{L}{u w_{b}}\\right)^{2}$$\nThis completes the derivation of the symbolic expression.\n\nThe next step is to compute the numerical value of $N$ using the provided data:\n$L = 0.1000\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$u = 0.002000\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$w_{b} = 5.000\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we compute the product $u w_{b}$:\n$$u w_{b} = (0.002000\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (5.000\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 0.01000\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe units correctly result in meters, which matches the units of $L$.\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived expression for $N$:\n$$N = 16\\left(\\frac{0.1000\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.01000\\ \\mathrm{m}}\\right)^{2}$$\nThe ratio inside the parentheses is dimensionless:\n$$\\frac{0.1000}{0.01000} = 10.00$$\nContinuing the calculation for $N$:\n$$N = 16 \\times (10.00)^{2} = 16 \\times 100.0 = 1600$$\nThe input values $L$, $u$, and $w_{b}$ are all given to four significant figures.

A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n1) Derivation of the resolution expression.\nWe begin with the provided definition of chromatographic resolution, $R_{s}$:\n$$R_{s} = \\dfrac{t_{R,2} - t_{R,1}}{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(w_{b,1} + w_{b,2}\\right)}$$\nThe numerator represents the separation of peak maxima. Using the given relation $t_{R,i} = t_{0}\\,(1 + k_{i})$, the numerator becomes:\n$$t_{R,2} - t_{R,1} = t_{0}(1+k_{2}) - t_{0}(1+k_{1}) = t_{0}(k_{2} - k_{1})$$\nThe denominator represents the average peak width. First, we must express the baseline width, $w_{b,i}$, in terms of the plate count, $N_i$. From the definition $N_{i} = (t_{R,i}/\\sigma_{i})^{2}$, we find the standard deviation $\\sigma_{i} = t_{R,i}/\\sqrt{N_{i}}$. Substituting this into the expression for baseline width, $w_{b,i} = 4\\sigma_{i}$, yields:\n$$w_{b,i} = \\frac{4t_{R,i}}{\\sqrt{N_{i}}}$$\nNow, we use this expression in the denominator of the resolution equation, applying the stated assumption that $N_{1} = N_{2} = N$:\n$$\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(w_{b,1} + w_{b,2}\\right) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4t_{R,1}}{\\sqrt{N}} + \\frac{4t_{R,2}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N}}(t_{R,1} + t_{R,2})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the resolution equation gives:\n$$R_{s} = \\dfrac{t_{0}(k_{2} - k_{1})}{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N}}(t_{R,1} + t_{R,2})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{t_{0}(k_{2} - k_{1})}{t_{R,1} + t_{R,2}}$$\nTo express $R_{s}$ solely in terms of $N$, $k_1$, and $\\alpha$, we substitute $t_{R,i} = t_{0}(1+k_i)$ into the denominator of this intermediate expression:\n$$t_{R,1} + t_{R,2} = t_{0}(1+k_{1}) + t_{0}(1+k_{2}) = t_{0}(2 + k_{1} + k_{2})$$\nThis leads to:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{t_{0}(k_{2} - k_{1})}{t_{0}(2 + k_{1} + k_{2})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{2} - k_{1}}{2 + k_{1} + k_{2}}$$\nFinally, we introduce the selectivity factor $\\alpha = k_{2}/k_{1}$, which means $k_{2} = \\alpha k_{1}$. Substituting this into the equation yields the final expression:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{\\alpha k_{1} - k_{1}}{2 + k_{1} + \\alpha k_{1}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{1}(\\alpha-1)}{2 + k_{1}(1+\\alpha)}$$\nThis is the required expression for $R_{s}$ derived strictly from the provided definitions.\n\n2) Explanation of the primacy of selectivity, $\\alpha$.\nThe derived expression for resolution is a product of terms related to column efficiency ($N$), analyte retention ($k_1$), and selectivity ($\\alpha$):\n$$R_{s} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{2 + k_{1}(1+\\alpha)}\\right) \\left(\\alpha-1\\right)$$\nCoelution, by definition, means the analytes have identical retention times, and therefore identical capacity factors: $k_{1} = k_{2}$. The selectivity factor $\\alpha = k_{2}/k_{1}$ is thus precisely equal to $1$.\nIf we substitute $\\alpha=1$ into the derived expression for resolution:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{1}(1-1)}{2 + k_{1}(1+1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{1} \\cdot 0}{2 + 2k_{1}} = 0$$\nThis result is definitive. The resolution is zero regardless of the values of the plate count $N$ or the capacity factor $k_1$, as long as they are finite. The term $(\\alpha-1)$ acts as a multiplicative switch for separation. If $\\alpha=1$, this term is zero, forcing the entire product, $R_s$, to be zero. One can imagine infinitely efficient columns ($N \\to \\infty$) producing infinitesimally narrow peaks, but if there is no selectivity ($\\alpha=1$), these peaks will still be perfectly superimposed, resulting in zero resolution. Therefore, to achieve any separation at all (i.e., to make $R_{s}  0$), it is an absolute necessity to make $\\alpha \\neq 1$. Increasing $N$ or optimizing $k$ are secondary adjustments that improve an existing separation; they are powerless to create separation from a state of complete coelution. The establishment of selectivity ($\\alpha  1$) is the fundamental prerequisite.\n\n3) Quantitative evaluation of resolution.\nWe use the derived expression from part (1) and substitute the provided numerical values: $N = 16000$, $k_{1} = 2.00$, and the new selectivity factor $\\alpha = 1.05$.\nThe expression is:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{1}(\\alpha-1)}{2 + k_{1}(1+\\alpha)}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16000}}{2} \\frac{2.00(1.05-1)}{2 + 2.00(1+1.05)}$$\nWe calculate the terms separately. The square root of the plate count is:\n$$\\sqrt{16000} = \\sqrt{1600 \\times 10} = 40\\sqrt{10} \\approx 126.4911$$\nThe numerator of the fractional term is:\n$$2.00(1.05-1) = 2.00(0.05) = 0.100$$\nThe denominator of the fractional term is:\n$$2 + 2.00(1+1.05) = 2 + 2.00(2.05) = 2 + 4.10 = 6.10$$\nCombining these results:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{126.4911}{2} \\left(\\frac{0.100}{6.10}\\right) \\approx 63.24555 \\times 0.01639344 \\approx 1.03669$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required, we obtain the final numerical answer for the resolution.\n$$R_s \\approx 1.037$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.037}$$", "id": "2589559"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models provide a powerful framework, but practical chromatography often presents non-ideal behaviors that require sharp diagnostic skills.

The retention factor $k$ connects to the partition coefficient and the phase ratio via a proportionality that depends on how much of the bonded phase is actually wetted and accessible to the mobile phase. Consider interfacial thermodynamics of wetting: the sign of $\\cos\\theta$ in Young’s equation for a liquid in a hydrophobic capillary determines whether capillary pressure draws liquid into pores or expels it, and the liquid–vapor surface tension decreases when a small fraction of organic solvent is added to water. Use these fundamentals to reason from first principles about stationary phase wetting versus dewetting in nearly pure water.\n\nWhich option best explains the quantitative changes in $k$ implied by the observations, mechanistically attributes them to stationary phase dewetting (also called phase collapse), and proposes effective remedies that specifically address the wetting mechanism (including the use of polar-embedded phases)? Choose the single best option.\n\nA. The sharp drop in $t_R$ upon exposure to $0\\%$ acetonitrile corresponds to a decrease of $k$ toward $0$ because water does not wet the hydrophobic C18 environment; $\\cos\\theta$ becomes negative, capillary pressure expels water from pores, and only a small fraction of bonded chains remains accessible, reducing both the effective phase ratio and the partition coefficient. Adding a small amount of organic (for example, maintaining $\\geq 5\\%$ acetonitrile), using a polar-embedded bonded phase that maintains a low contact angle with water, or periodically flushing with strong organic followed by re-equilibration, all restore wetting and increase $k$.\n\nB. The hydrophobic effect is maximized in pure water, so $k$ should increase when acetonitrile is removed; the observed drop in $t_R$ must therefore arise from changes in $t_0$. To enhance retention, further decrease acetonitrile to $0\\%$ and increase salt concentration to raise water surface tension and amplify hydrophobic interactions.\n\nC. The loss of retention at $0\\%$ acetonitrile arises from reduced residence time due to lower viscosity, which decreases the effective column dead volume; to remedy this, decrease particle size and increase flow to offset diffusional limitations, because wetting is not a controlling factor.

It is not ambiguous, contradictory, or trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe fundamental relationship between retention time ($t_R$), dead time ($t_0$), and the retention factor ($k$) is given by:\n$$ k = \\frac{t_R - t_0}{t_0} $$\nThe retention factor is a measure of how much longer an analyte takes to elute compared to an unretained compound.

After flush and re-equilibration at $5\\%$ acetonitrile:\n    $k_3 = \\frac{3.40\\,\\mathrm{min} - 1.00\\,\\mathrm{min}}{1.00\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 2.40$\n4.  At $2\\%$ acetonitrile:\n    $k_4 = \\frac{2.80\\,\\mathrm{min} - 1.00\\,\\mathrm{min}}{1.00\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 1.80$\n5.  On a polar-embedded C18 phase at $0\\%$ acetonitrile:\n    $k_5 = \\frac{3.30\\,\\mathrm{min} - 1.00\\,\\mathrm{min}}{1.00\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 2.30$\n\nThe most striking observation is the precipitous drop in the retention factor from $k_1 = 2.50$ to $k_2 = 0.20$ upon switching from a $5\\%$ acetonitrile mobile phase to a $0\\%$ acetonitrile ($100\\%$ aqueous) mobile phase.\n\nThe retention factor is also defined by the analyte's partitioning equilibrium:\n$$ k = K_p \\cdot \\frac{V_S}{V_M} = K_p \\cdot \\Phi $$\nwhere $K_p$ is the partition coefficient of the analyte between the stationary and mobile phases, $V_S$ is the volume of the stationary phase, $V_M$ is the volume of the mobile phase within the column, and $\\Phi$ is the phase ratio. Since $t_0$ is constant, the mobile phase volume $V_M$ is constant. The dramatic decrease in $k$ must therefore be due to a decrease in either $K_p$ or the effective $V_S$.\n\nIn reversed-phase chromatography, retention of a hydrophobic analyte is driven by the hydrophobic effect. A more polar mobile phase, such as pure water compared to a water-acetonitrile mixture, should increase the hydrophobic partitioning of the analyte into the nonpolar C18 stationary phase, which would *increase* $K_p$ and thus increase $k$. This is the opposite of what is observed. Therefore, the simple partitioning model based on bulk properties is insufficient.\n\nThe problem guides us to consider the interfacial thermodynamics of wetting. The C18 stationary phase consists of porous silica particles with hydrophobic C18 alkyl chains bonded to the surface. These pores behave as a network of hydrophobic capillaries. The ability of the mobile phase to enter and fill these pores is governed by its wetting properties. According to the Young-Laplace equation for capillary pressure, the pressure difference across the curved liquid-vapor meniscus in a capillary is $\\Delta P = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}$, where $\\gamma$ is the liquid's surface tension, $\\theta$ is the contact angle with the capillary wall, and $r$ is the pore radius.\n\nFor a liquid to spontaneously wet and fill a capillary (capillary action), the contact angle must be acute ($\\theta  90^\\circ$), making $\\cos\\theta  0$, which results in a positive pressure drawing liquid in. Pure water is a liquid with very high surface tension ($\\gamma \\approx 72\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$ at room temperature) and it exhibits a large contact angle on highly hydrophobic surfaces like C18 ($\\theta  90^\\circ$). This leads to a negative value for $\\cos\\theta$. Consequently, the capillary pressure $\\Delta P$ becomes negative, creating a force that actively *expels* the aqueous mobile phase from the pores. This phenomenon is termed stationary phase **dewetting** or **phase collapse**.\n\nWhen dewetting occurs, the mobile phase is pushed out of the pores, which then contain vapor or are effectively empty. The analyte, dissolved in the mobile phase, cannot access the C18 ligands inside the pores. This drastically reduces the effective volume of the stationary phase accessible for partitioning, $V_{S, \\text{eff}}$. The effective phase ratio $\\Phi_{\\text{eff}} = V_{S, \\text{eff}}/V_M$ plummets, causing the retention factor $k = K_p \\Phi_{\\text{eff}}$ to drop towards zero. This perfectly explains the observed collapse in retention from $k=2.50$ to $k=0.20$.\n\nThe other observations are consistent with this model:\n-   The presence of even a small amount of organic modifier like acetonitrile ($2\\%-5\\%$) significantly reduces the surface tension of the mobile phase and its contact angle on the C18 surface. This is sufficient to allow wetting and maintain a high effective phase ratio, thus ensuring retention.\n-   The reversibility of the phenomenon is demonstrated by flushing with a high percentage of organic solvent ($50\\%$ ACN). This strong solvent readily wets the C18 phase, forces its way back into the pores, and restores the fully wetted state. Subsequent re-equilibration at $5\\%$ ACN maintains this state, and retention is restored ($k_3 = 2.40 \\approx k_1$).\n-   The polar-embedded C18 phase contains polar functional groups (e.g., amide) near the base of the alkyl chains. These groups interact favorably with water, creating a permanent hydrated layer at the stationary phase surface. This layer effectively shields the bulk mobile phase from the most hydrophobic part of the stationary phase, ensuring a low contact angle and maintaining wettability even in $100\\%$ aqueous conditions. This explains why high retention ($k_5 = 2.30$) is observed on this column at $0\\%$ acetonitrile.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The sharp drop in $t_R$ upon exposure to $0\\%$ acetonitrile corresponds to a decrease of $k$ toward $0$ because water does not wet the hydrophobic C18 environment; $\\cos\\theta$ becomes negative, capillary pressure expels water from pores, and only a small fraction of bonded chains remains accessible, reducing both the effective phase ratio and the partition coefficient. Adding a small amount of organic (for example, maintaining $\\geq 5\\%$ acetonitrile), using a polar-embedded bonded phase that maintains a low contact angle with water, or periodically flushing with strong organic followed by re-equilibration, all restore wetting and increase $k$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the decrease in $k$. It accurately describes the dewetting mechanism based on non-wetting ($\\cos\\theta  0$), capillary pressure, and the resulting reduction in accessible stationary phase volume (effective phase ratio). It correctly lists all three effective remedies that are validated by the experimental data provided: maintaining a minimum organic percentage, using a polar-embedded phase, and re-wetting with a strong solvent. This option is a complete and correct explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The hydrophobic effect is maximized in pure water, so $k$ should increase when acetonitrile is removed; the observed drop in $t_R$ must therefore arise from changes in $t_0$. To enhance retention, further decrease acetonitrile to $0\\%$ and increase salt concentration to raise water surface tension and amplify hydrophobic interactions.**\nThis option starts with a correct but incomplete premise about the hydrophobic effect and reaches a false conclusion. The assertion that the drop in $t_R$ must arise from changes in $t_0$ is directly contradicted by the problem statement that \"$t_0$ ... is observed to remain constant\". The proposed remedies are counterproductive: decreasing acetonitrile to $0\\%$ is what causes the problem, and increasing surface tension (by adding salt) would worsen dewetting.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The loss of retention at $0\\%$ acetonitrile arises from reduced residence time due to lower viscosity, which decreases the effective column dead volume; to remedy this, decrease particle size and increase flow to offset diffusional limitations, because wetting is not a controlling factor. Polar-embedded phases would not help because they do not increase hydrophobic surface area.**\nThis option presents a cascade of errors. Viscosity changes are not the cause, and they do not directly alter the dead volume. The claim that this decreases the dead volume is false, and again, contradicts the given that $t_0$ is constant. The central claim that \"wetting is not a controlling factor\" is precisely the opposite of the true mechanism. The proposed remedies address column efficiency, not retention, and are irrelevant to the problem. The final claim that polar-embedded phases would not help is factually wrong and disproven by the data in the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The behavior indicates that the method should switch to Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC) while maintaining water at $\\geq 95\\%$, since polar analyte–stationary phase interactions increase in water. Polar-embedded phases would make dewetting worse by increasing the preference for organic solvent at the surface, thereby reducing $k$ under aqueous conditions.**\nThis option is fundamentally confused. HILIC is for polar analytes, but the problem specifies a hydrophobic analyte. HILIC operates with high organic mobile phases, not high aqueous phases. The assertion that a polar-embedded phase would make dewetting worse is directly refuted by both theory and the experimental data provided ($k_5 = 2.30$ at $0\\%$ ACN). The reasoning for why they would fail is also incorrect; they improve wetting by increasing affinity for water, not organic solvent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, option A is the only one that provides a scientifically correct and comprehensive explanation consistent with all provided data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2589539"}]}
