You are asked to evaluate mechanistic causes for this IEF-specific streaking and to propose quantitative tests capable of confirming or refuting each cause.\n\nBase your reasoning on first principles: in IEF, proteins migrate under an electric field until reaching their isoelectric point (pI) where net charge is zero; stable focusing arises from a balance between electrophoretic drift and diffusion in a fixed pH gradient.

The observation of horizontal streaking specifically in the isoelectric focusing (IEF) dimension, while the second dimension (SDS-PAGE) separation is effective, correctly localizes the issue to the first-dimension separation. The problem requires an evaluation of potential causes based on fundamental biochemical principles. We will now proceed to analyze each option.\n\nThe core phenomenon to explain is the failure of proteins to focus at discrete isoelectric points ($\\mathrm{pI}$) during IEF, leading to a smear or streak across a range of $\\mathrm{pH}$ values. This indicates a disruption of the equilibrium between electrophoretic migration and diffusion that defines the focusing process.\n\nA. This option posits that high ionic strength from residual salts disrupts focusing. Mechanistically, this is sound. According to Ohm's Law, a high concentration of mobile ions in the sample leads to high conductivity. When a voltage is applied across the immobilized $\\mathrm{pH}$ gradient (IPG) strip, this high conductivity results in a large initial current. Power supplies for IEF are current-limited to prevent excessive Joule heating, which would damage the gel and denature the proteins. Upon reaching the current limit, the power supply reduces the applied voltage. The resulting weak an electric field causes slow protein migration and inefficient focusing, yielding horizontal streaks. The proposed quantitative test is appropriate: measuring sample conductivity before IEF and monitoring the current during the run. The stated values are realistic: a conductivity above $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mS\\,cm^{-1}}$ is indeed problematic for IEF, and an initial current exceeding $200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ on a standard $18\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ strip at $1000\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is a clear symptom of excess salt. The proposed remedy—desalting the sample to achieve a conductivity below $0.2\\,\\mathrm{mS\\,cm^{-1}}$ and a corresponding current below $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$—is standard laboratory practice for resolving this issue. The diagnosis, mechanism, and test are all coherent and correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. This option suggests that proteins precipitate at their isoelectric point. This is a very common cause of IEF artifacts. At its $\\mathrm{pI}$, a protein has no net electrical charge. This minimizes electrostatic repulsion between molecules, which can significantly reduce the protein's solubility, leading to aggregation and precipitation. A precipitated protein ceases to migrate in the electric field. It may intermittently redissolve and migrate again, but this stop-and-go movement results in a horizontal smear centered around its $\\mathrm{pI}$. The proposed test—a microplate-based solubility assay across the relevant $\\mathrm{pH}$ range of $4$–$7$—is a direct and valid method to confirm this diagnosis. Turbidity measurement at $340\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is a standard technique for quantifying aggregation, and analysis of the soluble fraction after high-speed ultracentrifugation (e.g., $100{,}000 \\times g$) provides definitive quantification. A finding that more than $30\\%$ of a protein becomes insoluble is a strong indicator of a problem. The proposed solution, increasing the concentration of solubilizing agents such as the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) to $4\\%$ and the chaotrope thiourea to $2\\,\\mathrm{M}$, is a standard and effective strategy to combat aggregation in IEF. This option presents a valid cause and an appropriate experimental validation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. This option attributes the streaking to contamination with the anionic detergent Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS). This is a well-understood mechanism for IEF failure. SDS binds avidly to proteins, imparting a large, uniform negative charge that overwhelms the protein's intrinsic charge. An SDS-protein complex does not have an isoelectric point in the typical $\\mathrm{pH}$ range of IEF; it will remain strongly negatively charged regardless of the $\\mathrm{pH}$. Consequently, instead of focusing, the complex will migrate continuously toward the anode (the positive electrode at the acidic end of the strip), creating a long horizontal streak. The proposed quantitative test, the methylene blue active substances (MBAS) assay, is a classic colorimetric method specifically designed to quantify anionic surfactants like SDS. A concentration of SDS above $0.02\\%\\,(\\mathrm{w/v})$ is known to be sufficient to cause the described artifacts. The suggested corrective action, using a commercial detergent-removal resin to lower the SDS concentration below $0.002\\%\\,(\\mathrm{w/v})$, is the correct procedure to rescue the experiment. The option correctly links cause, mechanism, and a valid quantitative test.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. This option suggests that an under-crosslinked second-dimension polyacrylamide gel is the cause. This is fundamentally incorrect. The two dimensions of this electrophoretic separation are orthogonal and sequential. The first dimension (IEF) is completed first, establishing the horizontal position of the proteins. Only then is the IPG strip transferred to the second-dimension gel (SDS-PAGE) for separation based on molecular weight in the vertical direction. Any defect in the second-dimension gel, such as an improper total acrylamide concentration (e.g., below $7.5\\%\\,(\\mathrm{w/v})$), would affect the vertical separation, potentially causing vertical streaking, band broadening, or poor resolution by size. It could not, by any physical mechanism, cause horizontal streaking in the already-completed first dimension. Furthermore, the problem explicitly states that the \"second dimension bands appear vertically well-resolved,\" directly contradicting the premise of this option.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. This option identifies protein carbamylation by cyanate in aged urea solutions as the cause. This is a known and critical artifact in proteomics. Urea, used as a denaturant in IEF sample buffers, exists in equilibrium with ammonium cyanate. The cyanate ion can covalently modify primary amine groups on proteins (the N-terminus and the side chain of lysine). This reaction, carbamylation, neutralizes a positive charge, thereby making the protein more acidic and lowering its $\\mathrm{pI}$. A single protein can be modified at multiple sites, creating a population of charge isoforms, each with a slightly different, more acidic $\\mathrm{pI}$. On a 2D gel, this appears as a characteristic 'train' of spots or a horizontal streak extending toward the acidic end. The proposed test is definitive: incubating a lysine-rich standard peptide in the urea solution and using mass spectrometry to detect the characteristic mass addition of carbamylation ($+43\\,\\mathrm{Da}$). If a significant portion of the peptide ($10\\%$) is modified, it confirms the urea solution is reactive. The remedy, using fresh, high-purity, deionized urea, often with a cyanate scavenger like an ammonium salt, is the correct preventative measure.
