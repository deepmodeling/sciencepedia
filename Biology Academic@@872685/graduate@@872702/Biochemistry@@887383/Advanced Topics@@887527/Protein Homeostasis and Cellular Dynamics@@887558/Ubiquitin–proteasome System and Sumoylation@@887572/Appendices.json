The fundamental base for your reasoning is as follows: Ubiquitin (Ub) is conjugated to substrates via a cascade of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E$1$), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E$2$), and ubiquitin ligase (E$3$). Polyubiquitin chains are extended by forming isopeptide bonds between the C-terminus of an incoming ubiquitin and the $\\varepsilon$-amino group of a lysine residue on the previously attached ubiquitin. Substituting a lysine with arginine abolishes isopeptide formation at that position because arginine lacks a primary amine. Different linkages encode distinct fates: K$48$- and K$11$-linked chains are classical degradation signals recognized by receptors on the 26S proteasome, while K$63$-linked chains often mediate non-proteolytic signaling. Efficient proteasomal degradation typically requires a chain of at least $4$ ubiquitins in a proteasome-competent linkage.

Ub-K$0$ supports proteasomal degradation in both conditions via linear (M$1$) head-to-tail chains; Ub-K$48$R has no effect in Condition $1$ because mixed-linkage chains suffice; Ub-K$63$-only supports rapid degradation in Condition $2$, which is insensitive to MG$132$.\n\nB. Ub-WT yields proteasomal degradation in both conditions; Ub-K$48$-only blocks degradation in Condition $1$ due to lack of chain heterogeneity; Ub-K$63$-only supports degradation in Condition $1$ because any polyubiquitin chain of length $\\geq 4$ is proteasome-competent; Ub-K$0$ gives mono-ubiquitination but degradation proceeds slowly.\n\nC.

Ub-WT shows no degradation in Condition $1$ because CHIP requires branched K$11$/K$48$ chains that cannot form in vitro; Ub-K$48$-only and Ub-K$63$-only both abolish polyubiquitin chain formation because single-lysine-only ubiquitin cannot be activated by E$1$; Ub-K$48$R and Ub-K$0$ both produce short K$63$ chains that efficiently trigger proteasomal degradation in Condition $2$.", "solution": "Derivation of Expected Outcomes\n\nLet us analyze each condition with each ubiquitin variant based on the provided principles.\n\nAnalysis of Condition $1$: E$3$ CHIP + E$2$ UbcH$5$a (favors K$48$ chains)\nThis system is primed for proteasomal degradation of the misfolded substrate S.\n*   **With Ub-WT**: CHIP/UbcH$5$a will efficiently build polyubiquitin chains on S. Since the system favors K$48$ linkage, the chains will be predominantly K$48$-linked. These chains, being of sufficient length ($\\ge 4$), will be recognized by the 26S proteasome, leading to degradation of S. This degradation will be sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor MG$132$.\n*   **With Ub-K$0$**: The first ubiquitin molecule can be attached to a lysine on substrate S (mono-ubiquitination). However, since Ub-K$0$ has no internal lysines, no further ubiquitins can be attached. Polyubiquitin chains cannot form. Without a polyubiquitin signal, S will not be degraded.\n*   **With Ub-K$48$R**: The preferred lysine for chain extension, K$48$, is absent. While UbcH$5$a might be able to utilize other lysines (e.g., K$11$, K$63$), the formation of degradation-competent chains will be severely impaired. According to the problem's emphasis on K$48$ as a classical degradation signal, its removal is expected to abolish or drastically reduce degradation. No K$48$-linked chains will be detected.\n*   **With Ub-K$48$-only**: This variant forces the system to build exclusively K$48$-linked chains. Since this is the favored linkage for CHIP/UbcH$5$a, this reaction will be highly efficient. It will produce pure K$48$-linked chains, which are potent degradation signals. Robust degradation of S will occur, and it will be sensitive to MG$132$.\n*   **With Ub-K$63$-only**: The system is forced to use K$63$. UbcH$5$a can catalyze K$63$ chain formation, so a polyubiquitin ladder will be observed. However, the problem states that K$63$-linked chains are non-proteolytic signals. Therefore, despite the presence of polyubiquitination, S will not be efficiently degraded by the proteasome.\n\nAnalysis of Condition $2$: E$3$ TRAF$6$ + E$2$ Ubc$13$/Mms$2$ (K$63$-specific)\nThis system is designed to generate K$63$-linked chains for signaling purposes.\n*   **With Ub-WT**: The highly specific E$2$ complex Ubc$13$/Mms$2$ will selectively use the K$63$ residue on WT ubiquitin to build K$63$-linked chains. These are non-degradative signals, so no degradation of S will occur.\n*   **With Ub-K$0$**: As in Condition $1$, only mono-ubiquitination of S is possible. No chains, no degradation.\n*   **With Ub-K$48$R**: The mutation of K$48$ is irrelevant for this E$2$/E$3$ pair, which requires K$63$. Since K$63$ is present, K$63$-linked chains will be formed efficiently, same as with Ub-WT. No degradation will occur.\n*   **With Ub-K$48$-only**: This variant lacks K$63$. Since the Ubc$13$/Mms$2$ complex is strictly specific for K$63$, it cannot catalyze chain elongation. Only mono-ubiquitination of S will be possible. No polyubiquitin chains, no degradation.\n*   **With Ub-K$63$-only**: This is the ideal ubiquitin for this system. Pure K$63$-linked chains will be robustly synthesized. As these are non-degradative signals, no degradation will occur.\n\nEvaluation of Options\n\nA. Ub-K$0$ supports proteasomal degradation via linear (M$1$) chains. **Incorrect**. Ub-K$0$ cannot form any polyubiquitin chains. Linear chains are also irrelevant to the specified enzymes. Ub-K$48$R has no effect in Condition $1$. **Incorrect**. Abolishing the primary site for a preferred degradative linkage must have a significant negative effect. Ub-K$63$-only supports rapid degradation in Condition $2$, insensitive to MG$132$. **Incorrect**. K$63$ chains are non-degradative, and any proteasomal degradation would be sensitive to MG$132$.\n\nB. Ub-WT yields proteasomal degradation in both conditions. **Incorrect**. It only yields degradation in Condition $1$ because Condition $2$ produces non-degradative K$63$ chains. Ub-K$48$-only blocks degradation in Condition $1$. **Incorrect**. It should robustly promote degradation by forming pure K$48$ chains. Ub-K$63$-only supports degradation in Condition $1$. **Incorrect**. K$63$ chains are specified as non-proteolytic signals.\n\nC. This option provides a detailed summary of outcomes. Let's verify each point against our derivation.\n- Ub-WT: K$48$ chains and degradation in Cond. $1$; K$63$ chains and no degradation in Cond. $2$. **Correct**.\n- Ub-K$0$: Mono-ubiquitination, no degradation in both. **Correct**.\n- Ub-K$48$R: Abolishes degradation in Cond. $1$; permits K$63$ chains without degradation in Cond. $2$. **Correct**.\n- Ub-K$48$-only: Restores degradation in Cond. $1$; prevents chain assembly in Cond. $2$. **Correct**.\n- Ub-K$63$-only: Poor/no degradation in Cond. $1$; K$63$ chains without degradation in Cond. $2$. **Correct**.\n- MG$132$: Blocks degradation but not ubiquitination. **Correct**.\nEvery statement in this option aligns perfectly with the logical deductions from the problem's premises.\n\nD. Ub-WT shows no degradation in Condition $1$ because of a requirement for branched chains. **Incorrect**. The premise is that K$48$ chains are degradation signals, and this system favors their formation. The claim about branched chains is an unsubstantiated and complicating assertion. Ub-K$48$-only and Ub-K$63$-only abolish chain formation because they cannot be activated by E$1$. **Incorrect**. This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding. E$1$ activation occurs at the C-terminus of ubiquitin, independent of its internal lysines. Ub-K$48$R and Ub-K$0$ produce chains that trigger degradation in Condition $2$. **Incorrect**. Ub-K$0$ cannot form chains, and K$63$ chains do not trigger proteasomal degradation.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, Option C is the only one that is entirely consistent with the provided biochemical principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2614825"}]}
