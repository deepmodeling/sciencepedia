Consider a minimal two-state model in which the transitions are driven by three effective first-order processes: activation by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), deactivation by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and intrinsic GTP hydrolysis. Let the total KRAS concentration be conserved and denote by $f$ the steady-state fraction of KRAS in the GTP-bound state. Assume mass-action kinetics in which GEF-mediated activation occurs at an effective rate $k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}]$ acting on GDP-bound KRAS, GAP-stimulated hydrolysis occurs at an effective rate $k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}]$ acting on GTP-bound KRAS, and intrinsic hydrolysis occurs at rate $k_{\\text{hyd}}$ acting on GTP-bound KRAS.\n\nA glycine-to-aspartate substitution at position $12$ (G12D) in KRAS is known to perturb the active site geometry.

The GTPase activity of KRAS, which is the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), is fundamental to its function as a molecular switch. This reaction can occur intrinsically or be greatly accelerated by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP).\n\nIn wild-type KRAS, the active site is precisely configured to facilitate this hydrolysis. A key event is the nucleophilic attack on the $\\gamma$-phosphate of GTP by a catalytic water molecule. This process is supported by residues within the KRAS protein, notably Gln61, and the flexible P-loop (phosphate-binding loop), where residue Gly12 is located. The small size of the glycine residue at position $12$ imparts local conformational flexibility to the P-loop, which is essential for correctly positioning the substrate and catalytic machinery.\n\nA GAP enhances this reaction by inserting a conserved \"arginine finger\" (e.g., Arg789 from p120GAP) into the KRAS active site. This arginine residue plays a critical role in stabilizing the negative charge that develops on the oxygen atoms of the $\\gamma$-phosphate during the reaction's transition state. It also helps to correctly orient the Gln61 side chain, which in turn positions the catalytic water molecule for optimal nucleophilic attack.\n\nThe glycine-to-aspartate substitution at position $12$ (G12D) severely perturbs this finely tuned mechanism.\n$1$. The aspartate residue is significantly bulkier than glycine. Its side chain ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH}$) introduces steric hindrance within the confined space of the P-loop. This disruption alters the conformation of the active site, misaligning the $\\gamma$-phosphate of GTP and the catalytic water molecule. Consequently, the rate of *intrinsic* GTP hydrolysis is reduced.\n$2$. The G12D mutation has an even more profound effect on GAP-stimulated hydrolysis. The bulky and negatively charged aspartate side chain at position $12$ creates a steric and electrostatic barrier that prevents the GAP's positively charged arginine finger from properly docking into the catalytic site. Without the stabilization provided by the arginine finger, the transition state for hydrolysis is not efficiently formed, and the catalytic contribution of the GAP is almost completely abrogated.\n\nThe combined effect is a drastic reduction in both intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, trapping KRAS G12D in its active, GTP-bound state. This leads to constitutive, unregulated signaling through downstream pathways, which is a primary driver of oncogenesis.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the steady-state fraction of GTP-bound KRAS, denoted by $f$. Let $[\\text{R}_{\\text{D}}]$ and $[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]$ be the concentrations of KRAS-GDP and KRAS-GTP, respectively. The total concentration, $[\\text{KRAS}]_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{R}_{\\text{D}}] + [\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]$, is conserved.\n\nThe system is described by the following reaction scheme based on the problem statement:\n$$ \\text{KRAS-GDP} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}]} \\text{KRAS-GTP} $$\n$$ \\text{KRAS-GTP} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}] + k_{\\text{hyd}}} \\text{KRAS-GDP} $$\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of KRAS-GTP is given by the mass-action rate law:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]}{dt} = (k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}])[\\text{R}_{\\text{D}}] - (k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}] + k_{\\text{hyd}})[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}] $$\n\nAt steady state, the net rate of change is zero, $\\frac{d[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]}{dt} = 0$. This leads to the balance equation:\n$$ (k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}])[\\text{R}_{\\text{D}}]_{\\text{ss}} = (k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}] + k_{\\text{hyd}})[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}} $$\nwhere the subscript 'ss' denotes steady-state concentrations.\n\nUsing the conservation relation, we can express $[\\text{R}_{\\text{D}}]_{\\text{ss}}$ as $[\\text{KRAS}]_{\\text{total}} - [\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}}$. Substituting this into the balance equation gives:\n$$ (k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}])([\\text{KRAS}]_{\\text{total}} - [\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}}) = (k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}] + k_{\\text{hyd}})[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}} $$\n\nWe rearrange the terms to solve for $[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$ (k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}])[\\text{KRAS}]_{\\text{total}} = (k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}])[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}} + (k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}] + k_{\\text{hyd}})[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}} $$\n$$ (k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}])[\\text{KRAS}]_{\\text{total}} = (k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}] + k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}] + k_{\\text{hyd}})[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}} $$\n\nThe steady-state fraction of KRAS-GTP is defined as $f = \\frac{[\\text{R}_{\\text{T}}]_{\\text{ss}}}{[\\text{KRAS}]_{\\text{total}}}$. Dividing the rearranged equation by $[\\text{KRAS}]_{\\text{total}}$ and the term in parentheses yields the desired expression for $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}]}{k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}] + k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}] + k_{\\text{hyd}}} $$\n\nNow, we compute the value of $f$ for the KRAS G12D mutant using the provided parameters.\nLet us denote the wild-type (WT) and G12D-mutant effective rates as follows:\n-   Effective activation rate: $k_{\\text{act}} = k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{GEF}]$\n-   Effective GAP-stimulated hydrolysis rate: $k_{\\text{gap}} = k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{GAP}]$\n-   Intrinsic hydrolysis rate: $k_{\\text{int}} = k_{\\text{hyd}}$\n\nThe wild-type baseline parameters are:\n-   $k_{\\text{act,WT}} = 0.050\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{\\text{gap,WT}} = 0.400\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{\\text{int,WT}} = 3.3 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nFor the G12D mutant, the changes are:\n-   $k_{\\text{act,G12D}} = k_{\\text{act,WT}} = 0.050\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{\\text{gap,G12D}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{gap,WT}}}{50} = \\frac{0.400\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{50} = 0.008\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{\\text{int,G12D}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{int,WT}}}{3} = \\frac{3.3 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{3} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these G12D-specific rates into the expression for $f$:\n$$ f_{\\text{G12D}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{act,G12D}}}{k_{\\text{act,G12D}} + k_{\\text{gap,G12D}} + k_{\\text{int,G12D}}} $$\n$$ f_{\\text{G12D}} = \\frac{0.050}{0.050 + 0.008 + 1.1 \\times 10^{-4}} $$\n$$ f_{\\text{G12D}} = \\frac{0.050}{0.058 + 0.00011} $$\n$$ f_{\\text{G12D}} = \\frac{0.050}{0.05811} $$\n$$ f_{\\text{G12D}} \\approx 0.86043709... $$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.8604$.
