We may proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must derive the general formula for the buoyant density, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, of a composite particle, which in this context is a lipoprotein. Let the particle have a total mass $M_{\\mathrm{total}}$. The particle is composed of $n$ different components. Let the mass fraction of component $i$ be $w_i$, and its intrinsic density be $\\rho_i$.\n\nBy definition, the mass of component $i$ is $m_i = w_i M_{\\mathrm{total}}$. The total mass is conserved, so $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1$.\n\nThe volume of component $i$ is given by $v_i = \\frac{m_i}{\\rho_i}$. Substituting the expression for $m_i$, we get $v_i = \\frac{w_i M_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\rho_i}$.\n\nThe problem states to assume ideal mixing with additive partial volumes. Therefore, the total volume of the lipoprotein particle, $V_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of the volumes of its components:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{w_i M_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\rho_i} $$\nWe can factor out the constant total mass $M_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{total}} = M_{\\mathrm{total}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{w_i}{\\rho_i} $$\nThe buoyant density of the mixture, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is defined as the total mass divided by the total volume:\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_{\\mathrm{total}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{total}}$ yields:\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{total}}}{M_{\\mathrm{total}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{w_i}{\\rho_i}} $$\nThe term $M_{\\mathrm{total}}$ cancels, leading to the general formula for the buoyant density of a mixture:\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{w_i}{\\rho_i}} $$\nThis formula shows that the overall density is the reciprocal of the mass-fraction-weighted sum of the specific volumes (reciprocal of densities).\n\nNext, we apply this formula to calculate the buoyant densities of VLDL ($\\rho_{\\mathrm{VLDL}}$) and LDL ($\\rho_{\\mathrm{LDL}}$) using the provided data.

The ranking is $\\rho_{\\mathrm{LDL}} > \\rho_{\\mathrm{VLDL}}$. This is biochemically justified. Lipoproteins are classified by their buoyant density, which is primarily determined by the ratio of lipid to protein. Lipids are less dense than water, while proteins are denser.\nVLDL is composed of $90\\%$ lipid by mass (with $60\\%$ being triglyceride, the least dense component, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{TG}} = 0.90\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$) and only $10\\%$ protein ($\\rho_{\\mathrm{P}} = 1.35\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$). This high lipid-to-protein ratio results in a very low density, below that of water.\nLDL has a lower lipid content ($80\\%$) and a higher protein content ($20\\%$). Critically, its major lipid is cholesteryl ester ($42\\%$), which is denser than triglyceride. This shift in composition from a triglyceride-rich core (VLDL) to a cholesteryl ester-rich core (LDL), coupled with a doubling of the relative protein content, results in a significantly higher density for LDL.\nThis compositional difference reflects their metabolic roles. VLDL transports triglycerides from the liver. As triglycerides are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase, the particle remodels, losing its low-density lipid core and becoming progressively smaller and denser, transitioning through IDL to form LDL. LDL's primary role is to transport cholesterol, and its higher density is a direct consequence of this metabolic processing and functional specialization. It is taken up by cells via the LDL receptor, a process critical for cholesterol homeostasis.\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $\\rho_{\\mathrm{LDL}}/\\rho_{\\mathrm{VLDL}}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{LDL}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{VLDL}}} \\approx \\frac{1.056027}{0.966826} \\approx 1.092260 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $1.092$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.092}$$", "id": "2574152"}, {"introduction": "Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a cornerstone of cellular cholesterol homeostasis, and the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway is the canonical example.

We now evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A**: \"$H$ increases by $+150\\%$ and $L$ decreases by $-30\\%$; the paradox arises because a larger HDL cholesteryl ester pool does not guarantee higher reverse cholesterol transport flux: blocking CETP removes the apoB/LDLR route for delivering cholesteryl ester to the liver, shifting reliance to SR-BI. If hepatic SR-BI capacity is not upregulated, total hepatic cholesterol delivery may not rise. Moreover, large, cholesteryl-ester–rich HDL can be less effective acceptors for macrophage cholesterol via ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and low-density lipoprotein particle number (apoB) may not fall in proportion to LDL-C mass, yielding variable atherosclerosis risk.\"\n\n- **Numerical evaluation**: The calculated percentage changes, $+150\\%$ for $H$ and $-30\\%$ for $L$, are in exact agreement with this option.\n- **Mechanistic evaluation**: The rationale is scientifically sound. Let us examine the total flux of cholesteryl ester out of the HDL pool, $F_{RCT} = (k_{\\mathrm{CETP}} + k_{\\mathrm{SRBI}})H$. From the steady-state equation for $H$, we see that this total flux is always equal to $J_{\\mathrm{LCAT}}$. Since $J_{\\mathrm{LCAT}}$ is constant, the total reverse cholesterol transport flux through the HDL pool does not change in this model. The block in CETP simply reroutes the flux from the CETP/LDL/LDLR pathway to the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) pathway. The rationale correctly states that the total delivery to the liver may not rise, which is consistent with our model's prediction of constant flux. The explanation astutely introduces concepts beyond the simplified model to explain the clinical paradox: (i) large, CE-rich HDL particles, which accumulate in CETP deficiency, are poor substrates for ABCA1, impairing the initial step of cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells; and (ii) LDL-C (mass) is a less reliable risk marker than LDL particle number (apoB concentration). Reduced CE transfer via CETP can lead to cholesterol-depleted LDL particles, causing a drop in LDL-C without a proportional drop in atherogenic LDL particle number. This is a comprehensive and accurate explanation.\n\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B**: \"$H$ increases by $+50\\%$ and $L$ increases by $+30\\%$; the paradox is explained because impaired CETP elevates hepatocyte cholesterol, downregulating LDLR and driving LDL accumulation, while high HDL-C per se is always protective.\"\n\n- **Numerical evaluation**: The calculated percentage changes for both $H$ ($+150\\%$) and $L$ ($-30\\%$) are incorrect.\n- **Mechanistic evaluation**: The reasoning is flawed. The model predicts LDL ($L$) decreases, contradicting the claim of \"LDL accumulation\". The total rate of cholesterol delivery to the liver via both SR-BI and LDL receptor (LDLR) pathways is $F_{liver} = k_{\\mathrm{SRBI}}H + k_{\\mathrm{LDLR}}L$. Before the mutation, $F_{liver,0} = (0.5)(\\frac{200}{3}) + (2.0)(\\frac{250}{3}) = \\frac{100}{3} + \\frac{500}{3} = \\frac{600}{3} = 200$. After the mutation, $F_{liver,1} = (0.5)(\\frac{500}{3}) + (2.0)(\\frac{175}{3}) = \\frac{250}{3} + \\frac{350}{3} = \\frac{600}{3} = 200$. The total hepatic cholesterol uptake is unchanged, contradicting the premise that CETP inhibition \"elevates hepatocyte cholesterol\". The assertion that \"high HDL-C per se is always protective\" is a naive oversimplification that the problem's paradox is built upon refuting.\n\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C**: \"$H$ increases by $+150\\%$ and $L$ shows approximately $0\\%$ change; the paradox is explained because HDL-C concentration is the causal anti-atherogenic factor regardless of particle function or hepatic uptake pathways, and SR-BI is irrelevant when CETP is low.\"\n\n- **Numerical evaluation**: The value for $H$ is correct, but the \"approximately $0\\%$ change\" for $L$ is incorrect. Our calculation shows a significant decrease of $-30\\%$.\n- **Mechanistic evaluation**: The rationale is fundamentally wrong. It claims SR-BI is irrelevant, but our calculations of flux show that the SR-BI pathway becomes dominant. The flux via SR-BI, $F_{\\mathrm{SRBI}} = k_{\\mathrm{SRBI}}H$, increases from $0.5 \\times \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 33.3$ to $0.5 \\times \\frac{500}{3} \\approx 83.3$. The rationale also ignores HDL particle function, a critical factor in understanding the paradox.\n\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**: \"$H$ decreases by $-60\\%$ and $L$ decreases by $-30\\%$; the paradox is explained because CETP deficiency accelerates SR-BI–mediated HDL clearance and stimulates LDLR-independent remnant uptake via LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), uniformly lowering risk.\"\n\n- **Numerical evaluation**: The value for $L$ is correct, but the change in $H$ is incorrect in both magnitude and direction. $H$ increases by $+150\\%$, it does not decrease.\n- **Mechanistic evaluation**: The primary numerical prediction for $H$ is incorrect. While the flux through SR-BI does increase, claiming this \"accelerates...clearance\" is ambiguous; the fractional clearance rate ($k_{\\mathrm{SRBI}}$) is constant. The invoking of LRP1 is external to the model, which explicitly assumes non-LDLR clearance is negligible. The claim of \"uniformly lowering risk\" contradicts the clinical trial evidence that motivates the paradox.\n\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation and evaluation, only Option A provides both the correct quantitative predictions and a mechanistically sound rationale.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2574223"}]}
