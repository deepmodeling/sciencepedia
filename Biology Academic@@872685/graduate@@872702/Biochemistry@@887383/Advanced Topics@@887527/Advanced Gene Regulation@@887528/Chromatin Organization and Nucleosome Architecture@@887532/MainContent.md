## Introduction
The eukaryotic genome, spanning meters in length, must be compacted thousands of times over to fit within the confines of the cell nucleus. This remarkable feat is achieved by organizing DNA into a complex and dynamic nucleoprotein structure called chromatin. Far from being inert packaging, [chromatin architecture](@entry_id:263459) is a critical regulatory layer that governs access to the genetic blueprint, orchestrating fundamental processes from gene expression to DNA repair and replication. This article addresses the fundamental question of how this intricate organization is established, maintained, and dynamically regulated to control cellular function and identity.

To unravel this complexity, we will embark on a structured exploration of chromatin biology. The journey begins in the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter, where we will dissect the fundamental building block—the [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162)—examining its precise architecture, the [thermodynamic forces](@entry_id:161907) driving its assembly, and the models describing its folding into higher-order structures. Next, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will illuminate how our understanding of chromatin is applied, exploring the experimental techniques used to probe its structure, its critical role as a substrate in transcription and replication, and the functional consequences of the [histone code](@entry_id:137887) and [epigenetic memory](@entry_id:271480). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will provide an opportunity to engage with the quantitative aspects of chromatin [biophysics](@entry_id:154938) through targeted problems, solidifying the core concepts discussed.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Nucleosome Core Particle: The Fundamental Unit of Chromatin

The eukaryotic genome is not a naked polymer of DNA; rather, it is extensively compacted and organized into a dynamic nucleoprotein complex known as chromatin. The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the **nucleosome**. A comprehensive understanding of chromatin biology must, therefore, begin with a rigorous description of the [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162)'s architecture and the principles governing its assembly.

#### Architectural Blueprint of the Nucleosome

The modern definition of the nucleosome's core structure is derived from a confluence of biophysical and biochemical experiments, including nuclease [digestion](@entry_id:147945), site-specific [cross-linking](@entry_id:182032), and high-resolution structural methods like X-ray crystallography and [cryo-electron microscopy](@entry_id:150624). When chromatin is subjected to limited digestion with **micrococcal nuclease (MNase)**, an enzyme that preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes, a characteristic pattern of protected DNA fragments emerges. The most stable and well-defined of these is a fragment of approximately **147 base pairs (bp)**. This fragment is associated with the most fundamental [chromatin structure](@entry_id:197308): the **nucleosome core particle (NCP)** [@problem_id:2550425].

The NCP consists of this 147 bp segment of DNA wrapped around a protein core. Quantitative mass spectrometry reveals this core to be a **histone octamer**, composed of two copies each of the four core histones: **H2A, H2B, H3, and H4**. The DNA follows a left-handed superhelical path around this octamer, completing approximately **1.65 to 1.7 turns**. A key feature of the NCP is its [internal symmetry](@entry_id:168727). Both the histone octamer and the path of the wrapped DNA possess an approximate two-fold [rotational symmetry](@entry_id:137077). The axis of this symmetry is known as the **dyad axis**, which passes through the center of the particle and bisects the 147 bp DNA segment. This symmetry means that the interactions and structure of one half of the NCP are a near-perfect mirror image of the other half [@problem_id:2550425].

During nucleosome assembly or disassembly, or under conditions of partial MNase digestion, stable subnucleosomal particles can be observed. These intermediates lack the full octameric composition and protect shorter DNA fragments. The most prominent of these are the **tetrasome**, consisting of the central $(\text{H3}-\text{H4})_2$ tetramer and approximately 80 bp of DNA, and the **hexasome**, comprising the tetrasome plus a single H2A-H2B dimer, protecting around 120–130 bp of DNA. The existence of these stable intermediates provides crucial insight into the stepwise nature of nucleosome assembly [@problem_id:2550425].

#### The Histone Fold and Stepwise Assembly of the Octamer

The intricate architecture of the histone octamer is built upon a simple yet elegant structural motif shared by all core [histones](@entry_id:164675): the **[histone](@entry_id:177488) fold**. This motif consists of three $\alpha$-helices ($\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, and $\alpha_3$) connected by two loops (L1 and L2), arranged in a $\alpha_1-\mathrm{L1}-\alpha_2-\mathrm{L2}-\alpha_3$ topology [@problem_id:2550430].

Histone assembly does not occur through random aggregation but follows a highly ordered, hierarchical pathway. The first step is the formation of specific heterodimers through a **"handshake" interaction** between two [histone](@entry_id:177488) folds. In this arrangement, the long $\alpha_2$ helices of two histone monomers pack against each other in an antiparallel fashion, stabilized primarily by hydrophobic interactions. This handshake motif pairs H3 with H4 to form an H3-H4 heterodimer, and H2A with H2B to form an H2A-H2B heterodimer.

The next crucial step in building the octameric core is the formation of the **$(\text{H3}-\text{H4})_2$ tetramer**. Two H3-H4 heterodimers associate via a strong, symmetric interface between the two H3 subunits. This interface forms a stable **four-helix bundle** involving helices from both H3 [histone](@entry_id:177488) folds. This interaction is so robust that the $(\text{H3}-\text{H4})_2$ tetramer is stable even in high-salt solutions (e.g., $2\,\mathrm{M NaCl}$) that dissociate the complete [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162). The formation of this tetramer is the key event that establishes the dyad symmetry axis of the future [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162).

The final stage of octamer assembly involves the docking of two H2A-H2B dimers, one onto each face of the $(\text{H3}-\text{H4})_2$ tetramer-DNA complex. This process is highly dependent on [ionic strength](@entry_id:152038). *In vitro*, [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) reconstitution is typically achieved by mixing histones and DNA in high salt and slowly dialyzing to physiological salt concentrations. At high salt, the hydrophobically stabilized $(\text{H3}-\text{H4})_2$ tetramer is the predominant species. As the salt concentration is lowered, [charge screening](@entry_id:139450) is reduced, allowing the positively charged tetramer to bind to the negatively charged DNA. This initial complex then serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of the two H2A-H2B dimers, whose association is more sensitive to salt and involves a combination of protein-protein and protein-DNA electrostatic interactions [@problem_id:2550430].

#### The Energetics of Ordered Assembly

The ordered, stepwise assembly pathway—tetramer first, followed by two dimers—is not arbitrary but is dictated by fundamental thermodynamic principles. We can understand this by considering the free energy changes ($\Delta G$) associated with the process, which involve a trade-off between the energetic cost of bending DNA and the favorable energy gained from histone-DNA contacts [@problem_id:2550404].

Wrapping DNA into the tight superhelix of the [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) requires significant bending, which carries a large energetic penalty. Let's consider a simplified thermodynamic model. The binding of the $(\text{H3}-\text{H4})_2$ tetramer to the central ~60-80 bp of DNA involves a substantial DNA bending cost (e.g., a hypothetical penalty of $+6 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$), but this is more than compensated for by the extensive and highly favorable [histone](@entry_id:177488)-DNA contacts made by the tetramer (e.g., $-12 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$). The net free energy change is therefore strongly negative ($\Delta G_{\mathrm{tet,naked}} = -6 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$), making this initial binding event spontaneous and stable.

In contrast, if a single H2A-H2B dimer were to attempt to bind naked DNA, it would also incur a large bending penalty (e.g., $+6 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$), but it makes far fewer contacts with the DNA (e.g., only $-4 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$ of favorable energy). The net free energy change for this hypothetical event would be positive ($\Delta G_{\mathrm{dimer,naked}} = +2 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$), indicating it is thermodynamically unfavorable. The [equilibrium probability](@entry_id:187870) of two states is exponentially related to their free energy difference, $p_{\mathrm{tet}}/p_{\mathrm{dimer}} = \exp(-(\Delta G_{\mathrm{tet,naked}} - \Delta G_{\mathrm{dimer,naked}})/k_{\mathrm{B}}T)$. Using our model values, this ratio is $\exp(8) \approx 3000$, overwhelmingly favoring the tetramer as the initial nucleating particle.

This illustrates the principle of **[cooperativity](@entry_id:147884)**. Once the tetramer has bound and established the initial DNA bend, the subsequent binding of the H2A-H2B dimers becomes much easier. The pre-existing curvature dramatically reduces the additional bending penalty (e.g., from $+6 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$ to just $+1 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$). Furthermore, favorable protein-protein contacts form between the incoming dimer and the bound tetramer (e.g., $-2 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$). Combined with the dimer's own DNA contacts ($-4 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$), the net free energy for adding a dimer to the tetramer-DNA complex is highly favorable ($\Delta G_{\mathrm{dimer|tet}} = -5 \, k_{\mathrm{B}}T$). Thus, the strong binding of the central tetramer not only provides a stable nucleus but also pays the energetic cost of DNA bending upfront, paving the way for the facile completion of the nucleosome [@problem_id:2550404].

### The Path of DNA on the Histone Surface

The precise path of DNA on the [histone](@entry_id:177488) octamer surface is critical for its function, dictating which parts of the sequence are accessible and how the DNA is topologically constrained.

#### Superhelical Locations and the DNA-Histone Interface

To describe the DNA path with precision, a coordinate system known as **Superhelical Locations (SHLs)** is used. The dyad axis, which passes through the central base pair of the 147 bp segment (bp 74), is designated as SHL 0. As one moves away from the dyad along the DNA, the SHL index increases or decreases by one for each full helical turn of the DNA around the [histone](@entry_id:177488) core [@problem_id:2550475].

High-resolution structures reveal a repeating pattern of histone-DNA interactions. A striking feature is that the orientation of the DNA's minor and major grooves relative to the histone surface is not random. At the dyad (SHL 0), the minor groove faces outward, away from the octamer. A half-turn of DNA along its superhelical path corresponds to a change of $\pm 0.5$ in SHL and rotates the DNA duplex by approximately $180^{\circ}$. Consequently, at SHL $\pm 0.5$, the minor groove now faces inward, making intimate contact with the [histone](@entry_id:177488) surface.

These inward-facing minor grooves are the sites of the most critical histone-DNA contacts, often involving the insertion of arginine side chains into the narrow minor groove. These contacts recur every full helical turn of the DNA. Therefore, the primary sites of minor groove compression and strong histone interaction occur at the half-integer superhelical locations: **SHL $\pm 0.5, \pm 1.5, \pm 2.5, \pm 3.5, \pm 4.5, \pm 5.5, \text{ and } \pm 6.5$**. There are 14 such major contact points across the NCP.

The distance between these successive contact points is approximately 10 bp. This periodicity arises because the intrinsic helical repeat of B-form DNA is about 10-10.5 bp per turn. By organizing its contacts to match this natural [periodicity](@entry_id:152486), the histone octamer can wrap the DNA without imposing excessive torsional stress (or "elastic frustration"), thereby minimizing the overall energy of the complex [@problem_id:2550475].

#### DNA Sequence as a Positioning Signal

While any DNA sequence can, in principle, be wrapped into a [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162), the energetic cost of doing so is sequence-dependent. This leads to the phenomenon of **[nucleosome positioning](@entry_id:165577)**, where histone octamers show a preference for binding to certain DNA sequences over others. Nucleosome positioning has two components: **translational positioning**, which specifies the linear register of the DNA relative to the [histone](@entry_id:177488) octamer (i.e., which base pair is at the dyad), and **rotational positioning**, which specifies the rotational orientation of the DNA helix with respect to the histone surface [@problem_id:2550402].

The biophysical basis for positioning lies in the **anisotropic flexibility** of the DNA double helix. The energy required to bend DNA is not uniform but depends on the specific base-pair step and the direction of bending. A/T-rich dinucleotide steps, such as AA, TT, and TA, are intrinsically more flexible and prefer to bend by rolling into their own minor groove. This narrows the minor groove, a conformation that is precisely required at the half-integer SHLs where the DNA minor groove faces the [histone](@entry_id:177488) core.

Therefore, DNA sequences that have a periodic arrangement of A/T-rich motifs with a spacing of approximately 10 bp have a high affinity for [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) formation. This is because such a sequence can align its intrinsically flexible, minor-groove-compressible steps with the 14 positions on the [histone](@entry_id:177488) octamer that demand such a deformation. This alignment constitutes a strong **rotational positioning signal**, as it fixes the orientation of the DNA grooves relative to the histone surface to minimize the elastic bending energy. While this enforces a strong rotational preference, it does not necessarily fix a unique translational position. A shift of the DNA by 10 bp would bring the next set of A/T-rich motifs into register with the histone contact points, resulting in an equally stable configuration. Thus, a 10 bp periodic signal creates a series of preferred translational frames separated by 10 bp [@problem_id:2550402].

#### The Topological Consequences of DNA Wrapping: The Linking Number Paradox

When a segment of a covalently closed circular DNA molecule is wrapped into a [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162), the topology of the circle is altered. This change is described by the **Călugăreanu–White–Fuller theorem**, which states that the **linking number ($Lk$)**—a [topological invariant](@entry_id:142028) that counts the number of times the two DNA strands are wound around each other—is the sum of two geometric properties: the **twist ($Tw$)** and the **writhe ($Wr$)**.

$$Lk = Tw + Wr$$

Twist is the number of helical turns of the DNA duplex about its own axis. Writhe is a measure of the coiling of the duplex axis in three-dimensional space. By convention, a left-handed superhelical path, like that of DNA in a nucleosome, contributes negative writhe.

Experimentally, the formation of a single nucleosome on relaxed, closed circular DNA changes the [linking number](@entry_id:268210) by approximately $\Delta Lk \approx -1.2$ [@problem_id:2550406]. This observation initially seemed paradoxical. Since the DNA wraps around the [histone](@entry_id:177488) octamer in approximately 1.7 left-handed turns, one might expect a writhe change of $\Delta Wr \approx -1.7$, and if twist were unchanged, a [linking number](@entry_id:268210) change of the same value. The discrepancy between the observed $\Delta Lk \approx -1.2$ and the expected $\Delta Wr \approx -1.7$ is known as the **[linking number paradox](@entry_id:172109)**.

The resolution to this paradox lies in the fact that the twist of DNA is not constant. In solution, relaxed B-form DNA has a helical repeat ($h_0$) of about 10.5 bp/turn. However, high-resolution structures show that DNA on the [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) surface is slightly **overwound**, with an average helical repeat ($h_n$) of about 10.2 bp/turn. The twist of a DNA segment of length $L$ is given by $Tw = L/h$. For the $L \approx 147$ bp segment, the change in twist is:

$$\Delta Tw = Tw_{\text{nucleosomal}} - Tw_{\text{relaxed}} = \frac{147}{10.2} - \frac{147}{10.5} \approx 14.41 - 14.0 = +0.41$$

The overwinding of the DNA (a smaller repeat value) leads to a positive change in twist. Now, applying the CWF theorem to the changes:

$$\Delta Lk = \Delta Tw + \Delta Wr$$

$$-1.2 \approx +0.41 + \Delta Wr$$

Solving for $\Delta Wr$ gives $\Delta Wr \approx -1.61$. This value is in excellent agreement with the writhe expected from ~1.6-1.7 left-handed superhelical turns. Thus, the [topological change](@entry_id:174432) induced by the [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) is a combination of large negative writhe from supercoiling and a smaller, opposing positive twist from DNA overwinding [@problem_id:2550406].

### Higher-Order Chromatin Structure and Dynamics

Nucleosome core particles are connected by stretches of linker DNA, forming a "[beads-on-a-string](@entry_id:261179)" fiber. This structure is further compacted into more complex, higher-order architectures, a process mediated by additional proteins and the [intrinsic geometry](@entry_id:158788) of the [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) array.

#### The Chromatosome and the Role of Linker Histone H1

The next level of organization above the NCP involves the binding of a **linker histone**, typically **H1**. The complex of an NCP plus one molecule of H1 is called a **chromatosome**. H1 binding increases the amount of DNA protected from MNase [digestion](@entry_id:147945) from ~147 bp to ~166 bp, indicating that it associates with the DNA as it enters and exits the NCP.

In the most widely accepted "on-dyad" model, the structured globular domain of H1 binds asymmetrically at the [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) dyad, making simultaneous contact with the central gyre of the nucleosomal DNA and with both the entry and exit DNA linkers. The highly basic, unstructured C-terminal domain (CTD) of H1 further extends along the linker DNAs, neutralizing their negative charge and stabilizing a more compact conformation [@problem_id:2550397].

This binding has a profound effect on the geometry of the linker DNA. In the absence of H1, the entry and exit linkers emerge from the nucleosome at a relatively wide angle. H1 acts as a bridge, pulling the two linkers closer together. This reduces the **external separation angle ($\phi$)** between the linkers and, consequently, increases the internal **entry-exit opening angle ($\theta = \pi - \phi$)**. This "sealing" of the entry/exit DNA makes the wrapped DNA less prone to spontaneous unwrapping or "breathing," thus stabilizing the chromatosome. From a thermodynamic perspective, the favorable electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions provided by H1 binding shift the free energy minimum of the system to a state with a smaller linker separation angle, creating a more stable, less dynamic particle [@problem_id:2550397].

#### Models of the Chromatin Fiber

The arrangement of chromatosomes into a compact fiber has been the subject of extensive study, leading to several idealized models. The geometry of the fiber can be described by two key parameters: the **entry-exit angle ($\alpha$)** set by the chromatosome, and the **rotational setting ($\beta$)** between adjacent nucleosomes, which is determined by the length of the linker DNA [@problem_id:2550459]. Because DNA has a helical repeat of ~10.5 bp, the length of the linker DNA dictates the relative rotation of successive nucleosomes around the fiber axis.

Two classic models emerge from this geometric framework:

1.  **The Solenoid (1-start) Model:** This model proposes that the nucleosome array coils into a simple helix, with each [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) in direct contact with its immediate neighbors. This continuous, helical ramp geometry is only feasible if the linker DNA length is an integer multiple of the DNA helical repeat (e.g., 21 bp, 32 bp, etc.). This results in a rotational setting of $\beta \approx 0^{\circ}$, meaning successive nucleosomes are "in-phase." The linker DNA must be significantly bent to follow the solenoidal path [@problem_id:2550459].

2.  **The Zig-Zag (2-start) Model:** This model proposes that the "[beads-on-a-string](@entry_id:261179)" fiber folds back on itself, with the linker DNA passing through the central axis of the fiber. This creates an architecture where nucleosome *i* is primarily in contact with nucleosomes *i-2* and *i+2*, forming two distinct stacks of nucleosomes that interdigitate. This geometry is favored when the linker DNA length is a half-integer multiple of the DNA helical repeat (e.g., 26 bp, 37 bp, etc.), resulting in a rotational setting of $\beta \approx 180^{\circ}$. In this "out-of-phase" arrangement, the linker DNA segments are relatively straight.

It is crucial to recognize that the [solenoid](@entry_id:261182) and zig-zag models represent idealized states. They are the specific outcomes for rotational settings near $\beta \approx 0^{\circ}$ and $\beta \approx 180^{\circ}$, respectively. For intermediate linker lengths that produce other values of $\beta$, neither geometry is stable, and the fiber is predicted to adopt more irregular, splayed, or polymorphic conformations [@problem_id:2550459]. In all these models, the entry-exit angle $\alpha$ acts as a secondary parameter that modulates the fiber's diameter and [compaction](@entry_id:267261) level.

### Regulation Through Chromatin Dynamics and Modification

Chromatin is not a static structure but a highly dynamic platform whose architecture is constantly reshaped to regulate DNA-templated processes like transcription, replication, and repair. This regulation is achieved through two major, interconnected mechanisms: [covalent modification](@entry_id:171348) of [histone proteins](@entry_id:196283) and the action of ATP-dependent [chromatin remodeling](@entry_id:136789) enzymes.

#### Covalent Modification of Histone Tails

The unstructured N-terminal and C-terminal "tails" of the core [histones](@entry_id:164675) extend from the nucleosome core and are subject to a vast array of **[post-translational modifications](@entry_id:138431) (PTMs)**. These modifications act as a complex signaling network, altering the biophysical properties of chromatin and creating docking sites for various effector proteins. The chemical nature of these modifications directly dictates their functional consequence [@problem_id:2550435]. At a physiological pH of ~7.4, the key modifications have the following effects:

-   **Lysine Acetylation:** The $\varepsilon$-amino group of a lysine residue, which is positively charged ($+1$) at physiological pH ($pK_a \approx 10.5$), is converted into a neutral [amide](@entry_id:184165) by the addition of an acetyl group. This modification directly **neutralizes the positive charge** of the lysine side chain, weakening the electrostatic interactions between the histone tail and the negatively charged DNA backbone. This generally leads to a more "open" and accessible chromatin conformation.

-   **Lysine and Arginine Methylation:** In contrast to acetylation, methylation of lysine or arginine residues **preserves the positive charge ($+1$)** of the side chain. Mono- and di-methylated lysines remain basic and are protonated, while tri-methyllysine exists as a permanently charged quaternary ammonium ion. Similarly, the guanidinium group of arginine ($pK_a \approx 12.5$) remains protonated after methylation. The primary effect of methylation is therefore not charge alteration, but the addition of bulky, hydrophobic methyl groups that serve as specific recognition motifs for a wide range of "reader" proteins.

-   **Serine/Threonine/Tyrosine Phosphorylation:** The addition of a phosphate group to the hydroxyl side chain of these residues introduces a significant negative charge. A phosphomonoester has two acidic protons; with a second $pK_a$ in the range of 6.0-7.2, the phosphate group will be almost fully deprotonated at pH 7.4. This results in the introduction of a **local charge of approximately -2**, which can induce [electrostatic repulsion](@entry_id:162128) with the DNA backbone or mediate [protein-protein interactions](@entry_id:271521).

-   **Lysine Ubiquitination:** A lysine's $\varepsilon$-amino group can form an [isopeptide bond](@entry_id:167736) with the C-terminal carboxylate of the small protein [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387). This process consumes both the positive charge of the lysine and the negative charge of the [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) carboxylate to form a neutral [amide linkage](@entry_id:178475). Thus, [ubiquitination](@entry_id:147203) **neutralizes the local positive charge** of the lysine. Its most dramatic effect, however, is the attachment of a large, structured protein domain ([ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) itself is ~8.5 kDa), which can sterically alter [chromatin structure](@entry_id:197308) or recruit other large [protein complexes](@entry_id:269238) [@problem_id:2550435].

#### ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling

While [histone](@entry_id:177488) PTMs provide a rich regulatory grammar, the physical restructuring of chromatin is carried out by large, multi-subunit enzyme complexes known as **ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers**. These enzymes all contain a DNA translocase motor domain that couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work on the nucleosome, resulting in three principal outcomes [@problem_id:2550436]:

1.  **Nucleosome Sliding:** Remodelers can reposition a [histone](@entry_id:177488) octamer along the DNA without dissociating it. This "sliding" activity is evident experimentally by the sharpening of MNase [digestion](@entry_id:147945) ladders, as [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162) arrays become more regularly spaced. This function is a hallmark of the **ISWI** (Imitation Switch) and **CHD** (Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA-binding) families of remodelers, which often act as "spacing engines."

2.  **Nucleosome Eviction/Disruption:** Some remodelers can destabilize [histone](@entry_id:177488)-DNA contacts so extensively that they cause the partial or complete removal (eviction) of the [histone](@entry_id:177488) octamer. This creates **nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs)**, dramatically increasing the accessibility of the underlying DNA to other factors like transcription machinery. This disruptive activity is characteristic of the **SWI/SNF** (Switch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) family.

3.  **Histone Dimer Exchange:** A third class of remodelers specializes in catalyzing the exchange of histone components within a [nucleosome](@entry_id:153162). A prominent example is the replacement of a canonical H2A-H2B dimer with a dimer containing a [histone variant](@entry_id:184573), such as H2A.Z-H2B. This alters the stability and functional properties of the nucleosome without changing its overall occupancy or position. This activity is characteristic of the **INO80** and **SWR1** families of remodelers.

These distinct activities can be experimentally distinguished. For instance, sliding changes the [periodicity](@entry_id:152486) of MNase fragments, eviction reduces the overall amount of histone associated with DNA (detectable by [sedimentation](@entry_id:264456) or [immunoblotting](@entry_id:192741)), and dimer exchange can be precisely monitored using techniques like Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) or [mass spectrometry](@entry_id:147216) that track the composition of individual particles [@problem_id:2550436]. Together, these dynamic processes ensure that [chromatin structure](@entry_id:197308) can be tailored in response to cellular needs.
