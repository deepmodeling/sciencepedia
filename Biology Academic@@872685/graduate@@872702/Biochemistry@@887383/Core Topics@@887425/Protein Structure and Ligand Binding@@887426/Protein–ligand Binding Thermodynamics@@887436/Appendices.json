You plan an Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) experiment in a $200~\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ cell to estimate the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{d}$ from integrated heats. The $K_{d}$ is a priori uncertain over three orders of magnitude, plausibly in the interval $[K_{d,\\min}, K_{d,\\max}] = [0.1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}, 100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}]$. The total protein concentration in the cell is $P_{t}$, which you control, and the dimensionless $c$-value is given by the standard definition $c = n P_{t}/K_{d}$.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysical chemistry, specifically ITC experiment design. It is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship $c(K_{d}) = \\frac{n P_{t}}{K_{d}}$. For a fixed $P_{t}$ and $n$, the value of $c$ is inversely proportional to $K_{d}$. This establishes a monotonically decreasing function $c(K_{d})$. The problem requires that as $K_{d}$ varies over the interval $[K_{d,\\min}, K_{d,\\max}]$, the resulting $c$-values must span the interval $[c_{\\min}, c_{\\max}]$. Due to the monotonic nature of the relationship, the minimum value of $K_{d}$ must correspond to the maximum value of $c$, and the maximum value of $K_{d}$ must correspond to the minimum value of $c$.\n\nThis leads to a system of two equations for the single unknown, $P_{t}$:\n$1.$ $c_{\\max} = \\frac{n P_{t}}{K_{d,\\min}}$\n$2.$ $c_{\\min} = \\frac{n P_{t}}{K_{d,\\max}}$\n\nWe must check for consistency. A unique solution for $P_{t}$ exists if and only if the value of $P_t$ derived from both equations is identical. This requires that $c_{\\max} K_{d,\\min} = c_{\\min} K_{d,\\max}$. Let us substitute the given values:\n$c_{\\max} K_{d,\\min} = (1000) \\times (0.1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$c_{\\min} K_{d,\\max} = (1) \\times (100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe condition is satisfied, confirming the problem is well-posed. We can now solve for $P_{t}$ using either equation. Using the second equation and substituting the values $c_{\\min}=1$, $K_{d,\\max}=100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $n=1$:\n$P_{t} = \\frac{c_{\\min} K_{d,\\max}}{n} = \\frac{1 \\times 100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1} = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThis result must be validated against the experimental constraint on protein solubility, $P_{t} \\le 150~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Since $100~\\mu\\mathrm{M} \\le 150~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the calculated concentration is physically achievable.\n\nNext, we compute the central $c$-value, $c^{\\star}$. This requires first calculating the geometric mean of the dissociation constant, $K_{d,\\mathrm{geo}}$:\n$K_{d,\\mathrm{geo}} = \\sqrt{K_{d,\\min} K_{d,\\max}} = \\sqrt{(0.1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\times (100~\\mu\\mathrm{M})} = \\sqrt{10~(\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{2}} = \\sqrt{10}~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nNow, we calculate $c^{\\star}$ using our determined $P_{t}$ and the value for $K_{d,\\mathrm{geo}}$:\n$c^{\\star} = \\frac{n P_{t}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{geo}}} = \\frac{1 \\times 100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{\\sqrt{10}~\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{10}} = 10 \\sqrt{10}$.\nThe numerical value is $c^{\\star} \\approx 31.6227766...$.\n\nThe problem demands the final answers be reported to four significant figures.\n$P_{t} = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ is written as $100.0~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$c^{\\star} \\approx 31.6227766...$ rounds to $31.62$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of these two values.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 100.0  31.62 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2594612"}, {"introduction": "Raw data from an ITC instrument reflects all heat-producing events in the sample cell, not just the binding interaction of interest.
