Constraint 1: All intermediate symbolic expressions must use radians for angles.\n8.  Constraint 2: The final numerical value of $p$ must be in Ångström (Å) and rounded to three significant figures.\n\nValidation proceeds. The problem is scientifically grounded, describing the standard mathematical model of an idealized helix, a fundamental concept in structural biology. The parameters and values ($100^{\\circ}$ rotation, $1.5$ Å rise) are physically realistic for an $\\alpha$-helix. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information and clear definitions to derive a unique solution without ambiguity or contradiction. It is objective and devoid of non-scientific claims. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution process commences. The objective is to derive an expression for the helical pitch, $p$, using the provided parameters and facts. Let $N$ be the number of residues required to complete one full turn of the helix.\n\nAccording to fact (i), angular rotations add linearly. The total rotation for $N$ residues is the product of the number of residues and the rotation per residue, $\\theta$. This total rotation must equal one full turn. As per fact (ii), a full turn is $2\\pi$ radians. Therefore, we establish the relation:\n$$N \\cdot \\theta = 2\\pi$$\nHere, $\\theta$ must be expressed in radians, as stipulated by the problem constraints for symbolic expressions. Solving for $N$, we find the number of residues per turn:\n$$N = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\theta}$$\nNote that $N$ is not required to be an integer for an idealized helix.\n\nAccording to fact (iii), axial rises also add linearly. The pitch, $p$, is defined as the total axial distance advanced in one full turn. This distance is the sum of the axial rises of the $N$ residues that constitute that turn. Therefore, $p$ is the product of the number of residues per turn, $N$, and the axial rise per residue, $d$:\n$$p = N \\cdot d$$\n\nTo obtain the final analytic expression for $p$ in terms of $\\theta$ and $d$, we substitute the expression for $N$ into the equation for $p$:\n$$p = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\theta} \\right) d$$\nThis rearranges to the final symbolic form, where $\\theta$ is in radians:\n$$p = \\frac{2\\pi d}{\\theta}$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate $p$ for the given numerical values: $\\theta_{given} = 100^{\\circ}$ and $d = 1.5$ Å. The formula requires the angle $\\theta$ to be in radians. We must convert the given angle from degrees to radians. The conversion factor is $\\pi$ radians per $180^{\\circ}$.\n$$\\theta_{rad} = 100^{\\circ} \\times \\frac{\\pi \\text{ rad}}{180^{\\circ}} = \\frac{100\\pi}{180} = \\frac{5\\pi}{9} \\text{ radians}$$\n\nNow, we substitute $\\theta_{rad} = \\frac{5\\pi}{9}$ and $d = 1.5$ Å into our derived expression for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{2\\pi d}{\\theta_{rad}} = \\frac{2\\pi (1.5 \\text{ Å})}{\\frac{5\\pi}{9}}$$\nWe proceed with the calculation. The numerical value of $1.5$ is equivalent to the fraction $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n$$p = \\frac{2\\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{5\\pi}{9}} = \\frac{3\\pi}{\\frac{5\\pi}{9}}$$\nTo simplify the complex fraction, we multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$p = 3\\pi \\times \\frac{9}{5\\pi}$$\nThe factor of $\\pi$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n$$p = \\frac{3 \\times 9}{5} = \\frac{27}{5} = 5.4 \\text{ Å}$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The total number of residues, $N = 18$.\n2.  The rise per residue along the helix axis, $h = 1.5$ Å.\n3.  The mean number of residues per helical turn, $n_r = 3.6$.\n4.  The hydrogen bonding pattern is between the carbonyl group of residue $i$ and the amide group of residue $i+4$.\n5.  A residue $i$ is defined as \"fully intrahelically hydrogen-bonded\" if its backbone amide N-H group participates as a donor in a hydrogen bond to residue $i-4$, and its backbone carbonyl C=O group participates as an acceptor in a hydrogen bond from residue $i+4$.\n\nWe are asked to determine three quantities: the axial length $L$, the total number of turns $T$, and the number of residues $m$ at each terminus that are not fully intrahelically hydrogen-bonded.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of the axial length $L$.\nThe axial length of the helix is the total distance it spans along its central axis.

Let the residues be indexed from $i=1$ at the N-terminus to $i=N=18$ at the C-terminus.\nAccording to the definition, for a residue $i$ to be fully bonded:\n1.  Its amide group (N-H) must donate a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group (C=O) of residue $i-4$. This requires that residue $i-4$ exists within the helix, i.e., $i-4 \\ge 1$, which implies $i \\ge 5$.\n2.  Its carbonyl group (C=O) must accept a hydrogen bond from the amide group (N-H) of residue $i+4$. This requires that residue $i+4$ exists within the helix, i.e., $i+4 \\le N$. Given $N=18$, this means $i+4 \\le 18$, which implies $i \\le 14$.\n\nFor a residue $i$ to be fully intrahelically hydrogen-bonded, both conditions must be met simultaneously. Therefore, a residue $i$ must be in the range $5 \\le i \\le 14$. The residues that are not fully bonded are those for which these conditions are not met.\n\nLet us identify these residues at each terminus:\n-   At the N-terminus: Residues $i=1, 2, 3, 4$ fail the condition $i \\ge 5$. Their amide groups cannot form the requisite $i \\to i-4$ hydrogen bonds because the partner residue would be outside the N-terminus of the chain. Thus, there are $4$ residues at the N-terminus that are not fully bonded.\n-   At the C-terminus: Residues $i=15, 16, 17, 18$ fail the condition $i \\le 14$. Their carbonyl groups cannot form the requisite $i \\to i+4$ hydrogen bonds because the partner residue would be outside the C-terminus of the chain. Thus, there are $4$ residues at the C-terminus that are not fully bonded.\n\nThe number of residues at each terminus that are not fully intrahelically hydrogen-bonded, denoted by $m$, is therefore $4$.\n\nIn summary:\n-   The axial length is $L = 27$ Å.\n-   The total number of turns is $T = 5$.\n-   The number of non-fully-bonded residues at each terminus is $m = 4$.\nThe requested output is the triplet $(L, T, m)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n27  5  4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2616114"}, {"introduction": "A protein's structure is not static but exists in a dynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states, governed by thermodynamics.
