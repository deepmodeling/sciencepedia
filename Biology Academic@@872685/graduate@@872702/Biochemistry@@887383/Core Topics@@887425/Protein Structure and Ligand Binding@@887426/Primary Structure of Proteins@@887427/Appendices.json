This practice [@problem_id:2064548] immerses you in the classic method of protein sequencing by enzymatic digestion. By using the known specificities of proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin, you can generate overlapping peptide fragments and piece them together, much like solving a logic puzzle, to reveal the complete primary sequence.", "problem": "A biochemist isolates a pure sample of a hexapeptide involved in a novel signaling pathway. Amino acid analysis reveals its composition to be one residue each of Alanine (A), Glycine (G), Leucine (L), Phenylalanine (F), Lysine (K), and Valine (V). To determine its primary structure, two separate enzymatic digestion experiments are performed.\n\n**Experiment 1: Trypsin Digestion**\nThe hexapeptide is treated with trypsin. Trypsin is a protease that specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of positively charged residues, namely Lysine (K) and Arginine (R), provided the following residue is not Proline. This digestion results in the formation of two smaller peptide fragments: a dipeptide and a tetrapeptide. The sequences of these fragments are determined to be Ala-Leu and Val-Gly-Phe-Lys.\n\n**Experiment 2: Chymotrypsin Digestion**\nA separate sample of the original hexapeptide is treated with chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin is a protease that cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of large aromatic residues, such as Phenylalanine (F), Tryptophan (W), and Tyrosine (Y), provided the following residue is not Proline. This digestion also yields two fragments, both of which are tripeptides. Their sequences are determined to be Val-Gly-Phe and Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nBased on these results, deduce the complete primary sequence of the original hexapeptide. Express your answer as a continuous string of one-letter amino acid codes, representing the sequence from the N-terminus to the C-terminus.", "solution": "We are given a hexapeptide containing the residues A, G, L, F, K, and V, one each. The trypsin digestion produces two peptides: a dipeptide Ala-Leu and a tetrapeptide Val-Gly-Phe-Lys. Since trypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Lys, the fragment that ends in Lys must be the N-terminal fragment containing the Lys at its C-terminus. Therefore, the tetrapeptide Val-Gly-Phe-Lys must be the N-terminal portion. The remaining dipeptide Ala-Leu must be the C-terminal portion that follows the cleavage site. Hence, the intact sequence consistent with trypsin cleavage is\nVal-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nTo confirm, we use the chymotrypsin result. Chymotrypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Phe. In the sequence Val-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu, cleavage after Phe yields two tripeptides: Val-Gly-Phe and Lys-Ala-Leu, which exactly match the observed fragments. This consistency confirms that the unique primary sequence is Val-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nExpressed in one-letter codes from N-terminus to C-terminus, the sequence is VGFKAL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{VGFKAL}$$", "id": "2064548"}, {"introduction": "Real-world biochemical analysis often presents unexpected results that require deep mechanistic understanding to interpret. This exercise [@problem_id:2064559] presents a classic case of experimental troubleshooting, where the Edman degradation sequencing reaction mysteriously halts. Solving this puzzle requires you to move beyond the canonical amino acid sequence and consider the world of post-translational modifications, demonstrating how a \"failed\" experiment can yield crucial information about a peptide's true chemical nature.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a novel hexapeptide, \"Cryopeptin,\" isolated from the muscle tissue of an Antarctic icefish. To determine its primary structure, two experiments are conducted.\n\nFirst, complete acid hydrolysis of Cryopeptin followed by amino acid analysis reveals that the peptide is composed of one residue each of Alanine (Ala), Glycine (Gly), Lysine (Lys), Methionine (Met), Phenylalanine (Phe), and Valine (Val).\n\nSecond, the intact Cryopeptin is subjected to sequential Edman degradation using Phenylisothiocyanate (PITC). The first three cycles proceed without issue, identifying the N-terminal sequence as Met-Ala-Val. However, the fourth cycle fails to yield any identifiable Phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid derivative, and all subsequent attempts also fail. This indicates a complete block in the sequencing reaction occurred when attempting to identify the fourth residue.\n\nWhich of the following potential post-translational modifications provides the most chemically sound explanation for the observed results?\n\nA. The N-terminus of the original peptide is acetylated.\n\nB. The fourth amino acid is proline, which forms a rigid pyrrolidine ring.\n\nC. The fourth amino acid is lysine, and its side-chain ε-amino group is acetylated.\n\nD. The peptide bond between residue 3 and residue 4 is N-methylated.\n\nE. The fourth amino acid participates in a disulfide bond with another residue.", "solution": "We begin by extracting the experimental constraints. Complete acid hydrolysis followed by amino acid analysis shows the hexapeptide contains exactly one each of Ala, Gly, Lys, Met, Phe, and Val. No other amino acids are present. Sequential Edman degradation on the intact peptide identifies the first three N-terminal residues as Met-Ala-Val. The fourth cycle fails to yield any PTH-amino acid, and all subsequent cycles also fail, indicating a complete block occurring when attempting to identify residue 4.\n\nThe Edman degradation mechanism requires a free N-terminal alpha-amino group to react with PITC under mildly basic conditions to form a phenylthiocarbamyl (PTC) derivative, which then cyclizes under acid to release the N-terminal residue as a PTH-amino acid and generates a new N-terminus for the next cycle. Critically, efficient Edman coupling requires a primary alpha-amino group at the N-terminus. If the N-terminus becomes a secondary amine (for example, an N-methylated alpha-amino group), PITC coupling is strongly disfavored and the sequencing reaction is essentially blocked.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. If the N-terminus of the original peptide were acetylated, the very first Edman cycle would fail because the alpha-amino group would be blocked and unable to form the PTC derivative. This contradicts the observation that three cycles proceeded successfully, so A is inconsistent.\n\nB. Proline would introduce a secondary amine in the backbone, which can reduce coupling efficiency, but the amino acid analysis shows no proline in the peptide (only Ala, Gly, Lys, Met, Phe, Val). Therefore B is incompatible with the composition.\n\nC. Acetylation of the lysine side-chain epsilon-amino group does not affect the alpha-amino group at the N-terminus required for Edman coupling. If anything, it reduces side reactions with PITC and would not cause a complete block precisely at cycle 4. Hence C does not explain the observed failure.\n\nD. N-methylation of the peptide bond between residue 3 and residue 4 means the backbone nitrogen of residue 4 is methylated. During cycle 3, the bond between residue 3 and residue 4 is cleaved to release PTH-Val, which is observed, so cycle 3 proceeds. However, after this cleavage, residue 4 becomes the new N-terminus but bears a secondary amine of the form $-NHCH_3$ (rather than a primary $-NH_2$). PITC coupling in Edman degradation requires a primary alpha-amino group; secondary amines do not react to form the necessary PTC derivative efficiently, leading to a complete block from cycle 4 onward. This precisely matches the observation.\n\nE. A disulfide bond involves cysteine residues, but cysteine is absent from the peptide composition, so E is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the most chemically sound explanation consistent with both the composition and the specific failure beginning at the fourth cycle is that the peptide bond between residues 3 and 4 is N-methylated, producing a secondary alpha-amino group at residue 4 after cycle 3 that cannot undergo Edman coupling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2064559"}]}
