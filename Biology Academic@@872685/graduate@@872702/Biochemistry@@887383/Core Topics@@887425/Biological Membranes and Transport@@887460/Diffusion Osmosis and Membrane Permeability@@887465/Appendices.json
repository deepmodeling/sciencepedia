It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The problem requires the derivation of the translational self-diffusion coefficient from fundamental principles and a subsequent numerical evaluation. We shall proceed.\n\nThe motion of a solute particle in a fluid, known as Brownian motion, is described by the Langevin equation. This equation models the particle's dynamics under the influence of two opposing forces: a systematic frictional drag force from the viscous medium and a random, fluctuating force from the thermal motion of the surrounding solvent molecules. For a particle of mass $m$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$, the Langevin equation is:\n$$m \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{drag}}(t) + \\vec{F}_{\\text{random}}(t)$$\nThe system is an isothermal, Newtonian aqueous environment with no-slip boundary conditions. For a spherical solute of effective hydrodynamic radius $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the drag force is given by Stokes' law:\n$$\\vec{F}_{\\text{drag}}(t) = -\\gamma \\vec{v}(t)$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient. For a sphere, Stokes' law provides the explicit form for this coefficient:\n$$\\gamma = 6 \\pi \\eta r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\nHere, $\\eta$ is the dynamic shear viscosity of the solvent. The random force $\\vec{F}_{\\text{random}}(t)$ arises from the incessant, chaotic collisions of solvent molecules with the solute. It has a time average of zero, $\\langle \\vec{F}_{\\text{random}}(t) \\rangle = 0$, but its magnitude is linked to the temperature of the system.\n\nThe core physical principle connecting the dissipative drag force to the stochastic thermal force is the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. For a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, this theorem states that the same microscopic interactions causing friction (dissipation) also drive the thermal fluctuations. A key consequence of this theorem is the Einstein relation, which connects the translational diffusion coefficient $D$ to the friction coefficient $\\gamma$ and the thermal energy scale $k_{B}T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant:\n$$D = \\frac{k_{B}T}{\\gamma}$$\nThis relation can be derived by considering a system of non-interacting particles in a gravitational or other external potential field. At equilibrium, the downward drift flux caused by the external force must be precisely balanced by the upward diffusion flux driven by the resulting concentration gradient. Equating these fluxes yields the Einstein relation.\n\nBy substituting the expression for the friction coefficient $\\gamma$ from Stokes' law into the Einstein relation, we arrive at the desired expression for the self-diffusion coefficient of a spherical particle. This is the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n$$D = \\frac{k_{B}T}{6 \\pi \\eta r_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nThis equation expresses the diffusion coefficient $D$ in terms of the temperature $T$, solvent viscosity $\\eta$, the effective hydrodynamic radius $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and the universal constants $k_{B}$ and $\\pi$, as requested by the problem.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical evaluation.

The short-circuit condition imposes $V=0$, but directly substituting $V=0$ into the above yields an indeterminate form. Taking the limit $V \\to 0$ via a Taylor expansion (or equivalently applying L'Hôpital's rule) gives the zero-voltage limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{V \\to 0} I_i(V) \\;=\\; P_i\\,z_i\\,F\\,\\big(C_{i,i} - C_{i,o}\\big).\n$$\nThis expression can also be obtained by linearizing the GHK current about $V=0$, where the purely concentration-driven term remains and the voltage-proportional term vanishes in the limit.\n\nThe measured short-circuit current density, denoted $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$, is the sum over all permeant ions:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sc}} \\;=\\; \\sum_i I_i(V\\!=\\!0) \\;=\\; \\sum_i P_i\\,z_i\\,F\\,\\big(C_{i,i} - C_{i,o}\\big).\n$$\nWe solve this equation for the unknown $P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ with $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{Na},\\mathrm{K},\\mathrm{Cl}\\}$:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sc}} \\;=\\; F\\Big[ P_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\,z_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\big([\\mathrm{Na}]_i - [\\mathrm{Na}]_o\\big) \\;+\\; P_{\\mathrm{K}}\\,z_{\\mathrm{K}}\\big([\\mathrm{K}]_i - [\\mathrm{K}]_o\\big) \\;+\\; P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\,z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\big([\\mathrm{Cl}]_i - [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o\\big) \\Big].\n$$\nRearranging for $P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\;=\\; \\frac{ \\dfrac{I_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{F} \\;-\\; P_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\,z_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\big([\\mathrm{Na}]_i - [\\mathrm{Na}]_o\\big) \\;-\\; P_{\\mathrm{K}}\\,z_{\\mathrm{K}}\\big([\\mathrm{K}]_i - [\\mathrm{K}]_o\\big) }{ z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\big([\\mathrm{Cl}]_i - [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o\\big) }.\n$$\nInsert the given data symbolically before numerical evaluation:\n- $z_{\\mathrm{Na}} = +1$, $[\\mathrm{Na}]_i - [\\mathrm{Na}]_o = 50 - 150 = -100$,\n- $z_{\\mathrm{K}} = +1$, $[\\mathrm{K}]_i - [\\mathrm{K}]_o = 100 - 5 = 95$,\n- $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -1$, $[\\mathrm{Cl}]_i - [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o = 150 - 155 = -5$.\n\nThus,\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\;=\\; \\frac{ \\dfrac{I_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{F} \\;-\\; P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\cdot (-100) \\;-\\; P_{\\mathrm{K}} \\cdot 95 }{ (-1)\\cdot(-5) } \\;=\\; \\frac{ \\dfrac{I_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{F} \\;+\\; 100\\,P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\;-\\; 95\\,P_{\\mathrm{K}} }{ 5 }.\n$$\nNow evaluate numerically at the final step.
