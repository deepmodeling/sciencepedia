We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Generalized Polarization (GP) for two membrane domains, liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld), and the difference between them.

The Laurdan molecule's emission spectrum is sensitive to the polarity and dynamics of its local environment. Specifically, the energy of its excited state is lowered by the reorientation of neighboring polar solvent molecules (primarily water) in a process called solvent relaxation.\n\nIn the liquid-disordered (Ld) domain, the unsaturated phospholipid acyl chains are loosely packed. This allows for significant water penetration into the membrane bilayer. The high concentration and mobility of water molecules facilitate rapid solvent relaxation around the excited Laurdan probe. This process lowers the energy of the excited state before fluorescence emission, resulting in a pronounced red-shift in the emission spectrum. Consequently, the emission intensity is higher at the longer wavelength ($I_{490} > I_{440}$), yielding a negative GP value ($GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = -0.3$).\n\nConversely, in the liquid-ordered (Lo) domain, the saturated sphingolipids and cholesterol are tightly packed in an ordered arrangement. This dense packing sterically hinders water penetration and reduces the motional freedom of any water molecules that are present. The environment around the Laurdan probe is therefore more rigid and less polar. Solvent relaxation is significantly restricted on the timescale of the fluorescence lifetime. The excited state remains at a higher energy level, leading to emission that is predominantly blue-shifted. Consequently, the emission intensity is higher at the shorter wavelength ($I_{440} > I_{490}$), yielding a positive GP value ($GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 0.4$).\n\nThe difference, $\\Delta GP = 0.7$, is a quantitative measure of the contrast in packing density and hydration between the two phases. A positive value for $GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}$ is expected, as GP values correlate directly with membrane order.
