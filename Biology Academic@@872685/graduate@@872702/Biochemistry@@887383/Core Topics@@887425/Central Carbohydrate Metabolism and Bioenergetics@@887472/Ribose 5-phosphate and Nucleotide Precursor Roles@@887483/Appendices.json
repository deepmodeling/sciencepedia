It is a well-constructed question in clinical biochemistry that requires a systematic analysis of metabolic pathways. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe patient's symptoms of gout and nephrolithiasis due to elevated serum urate indicate an overproduction of purine nucleotides, leading to excess catabolism into uric acid. The biochemical data from fibroblasts must be analyzed to pinpoint the defect in purine metabolism.\n\nFirst, let us review the relevant pathways. Purine nucleotides are synthesized via two routes: the de novo pathway and the salvage pathway.\n$1$. **De Novo Synthesis:** Synthesizes purines from simpler precursors.\nThe pathway begins with ribose-$5$-phosphate ($R5P$), which is converted to $5$-phosphoribosyl-$1$-pyrophosphate ($PRPP$) by the enzyme $PRPP$ synthetase ($PRPS$).\n$$ R5P + ATP \\xrightarrow{PRPS} PRPP + AMP $$\nThe committed step is catalyzed by phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase ($PPAT$), which is allosterically activated by its substrate $PRPP$ and inhibited by purine nucleotides ($IMP$, $AMP$, $GMP$).\n$$ PRPP + \\text{Glutamine} \\xrightarrow{PPAT} \\text{5-Phosphoribosylamine} + \\dots \\rightarrow IMP $$\nGlycine is incorporated into the growing purine ring during this multi-step process. Therefore, the rate of $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$-glycine incorporation is a direct measure of de novo synthesis flux.\n\n$2$. **Salvage Pathway:** Recycles free purine bases.\nThe key enzyme is hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ($HPRT$), which catalyzes:\n$$ \\text{Hypoxanthine} + PRPP \\xrightarrow{HPRT} IMP + PPi $$\n$$ \\text{Guanine} + PRPP \\xrightarrow{HPRT} GMP + PPi $$\nThis pathway is critical for two reasons: it is energetically less costly than de novo synthesis, and by consuming $PRPP$ and producing inhibitory nucleotides ($IMP$, $GMP$), it plays a major role in downregulating de novo synthesis.\n\nNow, we evaluate the patient's data:\n- **Observation 2 (Elevated $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$-glycine incorporation):** This indicates that de novo purine synthesis is significantly upregulated. This is the direct cause of purine overproduction and hyperuricemia.\n- **Observation 1 (Increased $PRPP$):** An elevated concentration of $PRPP$ ($3$-fold) would act as a powerful feed-forward activator of $PPAT$, driving the high rate of de novo synthesis. The question is what causes the $PRPP$ to accumulate.\n- **Observation 5 (Normal $R5P$):** The concentration of the precursor to $PRPP$ is normal, suggesting that the problem is not in the production of $R5P$ via the pentose phosphate pathway. This points to a defect either in the synthesis of $PRPP$ from $R5P$ or in the utilization of $PRPP$.\n- **Observation 4 (No incorporation of $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$-hypoxanthine):** This is a crucial finding. It demonstrates directly that the patient's cells cannot convert hypoxanthine into its corresponding nucleotide, $IMP$. This indicates a profound defect in the salvage pathway, specifically in the activity of the $HPRT$ enzyme.\n- **Observation 3 (No suppression by hypoxanthine):** In normal cells, adding hypoxanthine would fuel the $HPRT$-catalyzed salvage reaction. This consumes $PRPP$ and produces $IMP$, both of which inhibit de novo synthesis (the latter by feedback on $PPAT$). The lack of suppression in patient cells confirms that the salvage pathway is non-functional; externally added hypoxanthine cannot be utilized to generate the inhibitory signals.\n\nCombining these points: The inability to salvage hypoxanthine (Observation $4$) prevents both the consumption of $PRPP$ by the salvage pathway and the generation of feedback inhibitors from it. This dual failure leads to a large increase in the cellular $PRPP$ pool (Observation $1$) and removes a major brake on de novo synthesis. The high $PRPP$ level then drives excessive de novo synthesis (Observation $2$), leading to purine overproduction and gout. This narrative provides a single, coherent explanation for all observations.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Gain-of-function in phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase $1$ ($PRPS1$ superactivity)**\nA superactive $PRPS1$ would convert normal levels of $R5P$ into excess $PRPP$. This would explain the high $PRPP$ (Observation $1$) and the resulting increase in de novo synthesis (Observation $2$). However, the $HPRT$ enzyme itself would be normal. Therefore, the patient's cells should be fully capable of incorporating $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$-hypoxanthine into nucleotides, and adding hypoxanthine should suppress de novo synthesis. This contradicts Observations $3$ and $4$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Loss-of-function in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; encoded by HPRT$1$)**\nA deficiency in $HPRT$ directly explains the inability to incorporate $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$-hypoxanthine (Observation $4$) and the failure of external hypoxanthine to suppress de novo synthesis (Observation $3$). As the salvage pathway is blocked, $PRPP$ is not consumed by this route, causing it to accumulate (Observation $1$). The accumulation of $PRPP$ (a substrate and activator) and the lack of inhibitory nucleotides from the salvage pathway lead to uninhibited, high-flux de novo synthesis (Observation $2$). This results in purine overproduction and the clinical symptoms. This single defect explains all findings. The male patient presentation is also classic for this X-linked disorder (Lesch-Nyhan or Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Loss-of-function in ribose-$5$-phosphate isomerase A ($RPIA$ deficiency)**\n$RPIA$ is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that produces $R5P$. A deficiency would lead to *decreased* $R5P$ levels, which in turn would lead to *decreased* $PRPP$ synthesis and *reduced* de novo purine synthesis. This contradicts Observation $1$ (high $PRPP$), Observation $2$ (high glycine incorporation), and the clinical picture of purine overproduction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Loss-of-function in phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase ($PPAT$ deficiency)**\n$PPAT$ catalyzes the committed step of de novo synthesis. A loss-of-function would *block* this pathway, leading to *decreased* incorporation of $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$-glycine and purine deficiency, not overproduction. While the substrate $PRPP$ might accumulate due to the block, the overall phenotype would be the opposite of what is observed. This contradicts Observation $2$ and the clinical presentation of gout.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2602943"}]}
