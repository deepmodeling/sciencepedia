The mutation has not only reduced the efficiency for the cognate substrate by a factor of $0.0160$ (a reduction of over $60$-fold), but it has also inverted the preference of the enzyme. Therefore, the mutation catastrophically **decreases** the enzyme’s effective preference for the cognate tRNA over the near-cognate tRNA, which would lead to a loss of translational fidelity in vivo. The discriminator base $N73$ is thus confirmed to be a critical identity element.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0160}$$", "id": "2614128"}]}
