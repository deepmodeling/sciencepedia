The repair of $O^{6}$-methylguanine is performed by $O^{6}$-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a direct-reversal, single-turnover or “suicide” repair protein that transfers the methyl group to an active-site cysteine and is irreversibly inactivated after one repair event. Consider the following experimentally controlled regime: immediately after the TMZ pulse, each cell contains exactly $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$ $O^6$-methylguanine lesions distributed uniformly throughout the nuclear genome. Two isogenic cell lines differ only in the number of nuclear MGMT molecules available at the start of the pulse: the high-MGMT line has $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}$ molecules per nucleus, and the low-MGMT line has $M_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2}$ molecules per nucleus. Assume the following idealizations, each justified over the short post-pulse window considered: (i) the MGMT reaction is effectively instantaneous relative to enzyme resynthesis and turnover; (ii) each MGMT molecule performs at most one repair event; (iii) all $O^{6}$-methylguanine lesions are equally accessible to MGMT; and (iv) no other repair pathways act on $O^{6}$-methylguanine during this window.\n\nUsing only conservation of molecules and the single-turnover stoichiometry of MGMT, compute the fraction of $O^{6}$-methylguanine lesions that persist after MGMT has reacted to completion in the high- and low-MGMT lines.

It is scientifically grounded in the established biochemistry of DNA repair by $O^{6}$-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), well-posed with sufficient data, and objectively formulated. The solution proceeds.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fraction of persistent $O^{6}$-methylguanine lesions in two cell lines with different initial concentrations of the repair protein MGMT. The fundamental principle governing this system is the stoichiometry of the repair reaction.\n\nLet $L$ be the initial number of $O^{6}$-methylguanine lesions per cell nucleus. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$L = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$$\nLet $M$ be the initial number of MGMT molecules per cell nucleus. The problem defines two cell lines: a high-MGMT line and a low-MGMT line.\nFor the high-MGMT line, the number of MGMT molecules is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}$$\nFor the low-MGMT line, the number of MGMT molecules is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2}$$\n\nThe problem states that MGMT is a \"single-turnover\" or \"suicide\" enzyme. This means that one molecule of MGMT can repair exactly one $O^{6}$-methylguanine lesion before it is irreversibly inactivated. This establishes a strict one-to-one ($1:1$) stoichiometry for the reaction:\n$$1\\ \\mathrm{MGMT} + 1\\ O^{6}\\text{-methylguanine} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{inactivated MGMT} + 1\\ \\text{repaired guanine}$$\n\nThe total number of lesions that can be repaired, denoted $L_{\\mathrm{repaired}}$, is therefore limited by the number of available MGMT molecules. The reaction proceeds until one of the reactants, either the lesions or the MGMT molecules, is completely consumed. Thus, the number of repaired lesions is the minimum of the initial number of lesions and the initial number of MGMT molecules.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{repaired}} = \\min(L, M)$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the fraction of lesions that persist after the reaction has gone to completion. The number of persistent lesions, $L_{\\mathrm{persist}}$, is the initial number of lesions minus the number of repaired lesions:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{persist}} = L - L_{\\mathrm{repaired}} = L - \\min(L, M)$$\n\nThe fraction of persistent lesions, $f_{\\mathrm{persist}}$, is the number of persistent lesions divided by the initial number of lesions:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{persist}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{persist}}}{L} = \\frac{L - \\min(L, M)}{L} = 1 - \\frac{\\min(L, M)}{L}$$\n\nNow, we apply this general formula to each cell line.\n\nCase 1: High-MGMT Line\nThe initial numbers are $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}$.\nWe compare $L$ and $M_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$8.0 \\times 10^{3} < 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$$\nTherefore, $M_{\\mathrm{H}} < L$.

The MGMT enzyme is the limiting reactant. The number of repaired lesions is equal to the initial number of MGMT molecules.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{repaired, L}} = \\min(L, M_{\\mathrm{L}}) = M_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2}$$\nThe number of persistent lesions is:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{persist, L}} = L - M_{\\mathrm{L}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{4}) - (5.0 \\times 10^{2}) = 10000 - 500 = 9500 = 9.5 \\times 10^{3}$$\nThe fraction of persistent lesions for the low-MGMT line, $f_{\\mathrm{persist, L}}$, is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{persist, L}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{persist, L}}}{L} = \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^{3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{4}} = 0.95$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.950$.\n\nThe final answers are the fractions of persistent lesions for the high-MGMT and low-MGMT lines, respectively, reported as decimal fractions rounded to three significant figures.\nThe values are $0.200$ for the high-MGMT line and $0.950$ for the low-MGMT line.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.200 & 0.950 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2556236"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to suicide enzymes, DNA photolyases are truly catalytic direct repair enzymes, but their activity is governed by the principles of photochemistry.

By analyzing the specific interactions that confer MGMT's preference for $O^{6}$-methylguanine, you will devise a strategy to shift its specificity toward a different lesion, $O^{4}$-methylthymine, and predict the kinetic consequences [@problem_id:2556212]. This practice moves from analysis to synthesis, honing the skills needed for predictive protein engineering.", "problem": "A direct DNA repair protein, $\\mathrm{O}^{6}$-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), removes alkyl groups from DNA by transferring them in a single step to an active-site cysteine, in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N2$) reaction that dealkylates the base and yields an irreversibly alkylated enzyme. In crystallographic and biochemical studies of MGMT-family enzymes, three features are consistently observed: (i) a catalytic cysteine thiolate positioned for in-line attack on the alkyl group; (ii) a basic side chain that donates hydrogen bonds into the Watson–Crick edge of the flipped-out base and helps orient the reactive $\\mathrm{O}$-alkyl group; and (iii) a hydrophobic subsite abutting the base’s major-groove face. The natural substrate preference of the wild-type enzyme is toward $\\mathrm{O}^{6}$-methylguanine over $\\mathrm{O}^{4}$-methylthymine.\n\nYou are asked to rationally reengineer the active-site pocket to shift substrate preference from $\\mathrm{O}^{6}$-methylguanine to $\\mathrm{O}^{4}$-methylthymine and to predict qualitative kinetic consequences for each substrate. Your reasoning should begin from the following well-tested principles and definitions:\n\n- Hydrogen-bonding patterns at the Watson–Crick edge differ: guanine presents $N7$ and $O6$ as acceptors (and $N1$ as a hydrogen-bond donor in base pairing), whereas thymine presents $O4$ and $O2$ (and $N3$) as acceptors, with a $C5$ methyl that favors hydrophobic contacts.\n- In an $S_N2$ reaction, $k_{\\text{chem}}$ (the intrinsic chemical step) is increased by better in-line alignment and stabilization of charge development in the transition state; inappropriate orientation reduces $k_{\\text{chem}}$.\n- In a Michaelis–Menten framework, the initial velocity $v$ is $v = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_M + [S]}$, with $V_{\\max} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_T$. Decreases in $K_M$ reflect improved ground-state complementarity (tighter binding and/or more favorable formation of the catalytically competent complex), while increases in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ (or $k_{\\text{chem}}$ for single-turnover, stoichiometric enzymes) reflect improved transition-state complementarity and reaction path alignment.\n\nConsider the following hypothetical residue-level descriptions of the MGMT active site and proposed mutations. The wild type contains: an arginine that makes bidentate hydrogen bonds tailored to the guanine $O6/N7$ geometry (the “guanine clamp”), a phenylalanine that faces the lesion oxygen but does not donate a hydrogen bond, a small serine that lies adjacent to the base’s $C5$ position, and the catalytic cysteine (unchanged unless specified). Choose the option that most plausibly shifts specificity toward $\\mathrm{O}^{4}$-methylthymine and predict the qualitative kinetic trends for both substrates relative to wild type. Trends should be stated as directional changes in $K_M$ and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ (interpreted here as $k_{\\text{chem}}$ under single-turnover conditions) for each substrate.\n\nA. Mutate the guanine clamp arginine to glutamine (Arg$\\rightarrow$Gln), mutate the phenylalanine facing the lesion oxygen to tyrosine (Phe$\\rightarrow$Tyr), and mutate the serine adjacent to $\\mathrm{C5}$ to valine (Ser$\\rightarrow$Val). Predicted kinetics: for $\\mathrm{O}^{4}$-methylthymine, $K_M$ decreases and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ increases; for $\\mathrm{O}^{6}$-methylguanine, $K_M$ increases and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ decreases.\n\nB. Mutate the guanine clamp arginine to lysine (Arg$\\rightarrow$Lys), mutate the phenylalanine to phenylalanine (no change), and mutate the serine adjacent to $\\mathrm{C5}$ to serine (no change). Predicted kinetics: for $\\mathrm{O}^{4}$-methylthymine, $K_M$ decreases slightly and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ increases; for $\\mathrm{O}^{6}$-methylguanine, minimal changes in $K_M$ and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.\n\nC. Enlarge the base pocket by mutating the serine adjacent to $\\mathrm{C5}$ to glycine (Ser$\\rightarrow$Gly) and the phenylalanine to tryptophan (Phe$\\rightarrow$Trp), leaving the arginine clamp unchanged.

Answer by choosing a single option.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It provides a clear objective, a set of verifiable biochemical principles, and a hypothetical but plausible description of an enzyme active site. It is a valid problem for which a solution can be derived.\n\nThe objective is to rationally reengineer the active site of $\\mathrm{O}^{6}$-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) to shift its substrate preference from $\\mathrm{O}^{6}$-methylguanine ($\\mathrm{O6MeG}$) to $\\mathrm{O}^{4}$-methylthymine ($\\mathrm{O4MeT}$). This requires a set of mutations that simultaneously diminish the enzyme's affinity for and/or reactivity toward $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$ while enhancing its affinity for and/or reactivity toward $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$. We must evaluate each option against the provided principles.\n\nThe wild-type (WT) active site is optimized for $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$. Its key features are:\n1.  An arginine \"guanine clamp\" that forms bidentate hydrogen bonds with the $O6$ and $N7$ atoms of guanine. This interaction is highly specific and is a primary determinant of the enzyme's preference for guanine-based substrates.\n2.  A small serine residue adjacent to the $C5$ position of the base. This accommodates the hydrogen atom at the $C5$ position of guanine.\n3.  A phenylalanine facing the lesion oxygen, providing a nonpolar environment.\n4.  The catalytic cysteine, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\nFor the non-preferred substrate, $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$, this WT active site is suboptimal:\n1.  The arginine clamp is geometrically mismatched for the hydrogen bond acceptors on thymine ($O4$ and $O2$).\n2.  The small serine pocket provides poor van der Waals contacts and a possible steric clash with the bulky $C5$-methyl group of thymine.\n3.  The lack of an H-bond donor to the leaving group oxygen ($O4$) results in a less stabilized transition state and thus a lower $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n\nA successful reengineering strategy must address these points by: (i) breaking the guanine clamp, (ii) creating a hydrophobic pocket for the thymine $C5$-methyl group, and (iii) introducing interactions that stabilize the transition state for $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$ demethylation.\n\nLet us analyze each option:\n\n**A. Mutate the guanine clamp arginine to glutamine (Arg$\\rightarrow$Gln), mutate the phenylalanine facing the lesion oxygen to tyrosine (Phe$\\rightarrow$Tyr), and mutate the serine adjacent to $\\mathrm{C5}$ to valine (Ser$\\rightarrow$Val).**\n\n*   **Arg$\\rightarrow$Gln:** The guanidinium group of arginine is replaced by the amide group of glutamine. This disrupts the specific bidentate hydrogen-bonding clamp for guanine's $O6/N7$ pair, which will significantly weaken the binding of $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$, leading to an increase in its $K_M$. This loss of precise anchoring will also lead to misalignment for the reaction, decreasing $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n*   **Ser$\\rightarrow$Val:** The small, polar serine is replaced by a larger, hydrophobic valine. This creates a favorable hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate the $C5$-methyl group of thymine. This mutation specifically improves the binding of $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$, leading to a decrease in its $K_M$.\n*   **Phe$\\rightarrow$Tyr:** The nonpolar phenylalanine is replaced by tyrosine, which has a hydroxyl group. This hydroxyl group can act as a hydrogen bond donor to the oxygen atom of the leaving group ($O4$ of thymine). According to the provided principles, this stabilizes the charge development in the $S_N2$ transition state, thereby increasing the chemical rate, $k_{\\text{chem}}$, and thus $k_{\\text{cat}}$ for $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$ demethylation.\n\n*   **Kinetic predictions vs. analysis:**\n    *   For $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$: The mutations synergistically improve binding (Ser$\\rightarrow$Val) and catalysis (Phe$\\rightarrow$Tyr). Thus, $K_M$ should decrease and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ should increase. This matches the option's prediction.\n    *   For $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$: The Arg$\\rightarrow$Gln mutation severely impairs binding and orientation. Thus, $K_M$ should increase and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ should decrease. This also matches the option's prediction.\n\nThis set of mutations represents a coherent and rational strategy to switch substrate specificity, and the predicted kinetic consequences are consistent with the provided principles.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Mutate the guanine clamp arginine to lysine (Arg$\\rightarrow$Lys), mutate the phenylalanine to phenylalanine (no change), and mutate the serine adjacent to $\\mathrm{C5}$ to serine (no change).**\n\n*   **Arg$\\rightarrow$Lys:** Lysine's primary ammonium group is a hydrogen bond donor but cannot replicate the specific bidentate geometry of arginine's guanidinium group required for the \"guanine clamp\". This would weaken binding to $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$ ($K_M$ increases) and likely worsen its orientation ($k_{\\text{cat}}$ decreases). The prediction of \"minimal changes\" for $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$ is therefore incorrect.\n*   **No change to Phe and Ser:** The active site remains unfavorable for $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$. The steric clash at $C5$ persists, and there is no new H-bond to stabilize the transition state. Therefore, there is no reason to expect that $K_M$ for $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$ would decrease or that $k_{\\text{cat}}$ would increase. The option's prediction for $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$ is unsubstantiated.\n*   This is a poor engineering strategy as it only weakens the interaction with the original substrate without introducing significant favorable interactions for the new target.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Enlarge the base pocket by mutating the serine adjacent to $\\mathrm{C5}$ to glycine (Ser$\\rightarrow$Gly) and the phenylalanine to tryptophan (Phe$\\rightarrow$Trp), leaving the arginine clamp unchanged.**\n\n*   **Leaving Arg unchanged:** By retaining the arginine clamp, the enzyme maintains its primary and most powerful specificity determinant for $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$. This strategy is fundamentally flawed if the goal is to shift preference *away* from guanine.\n*   **Ser$\\rightarrow$Gly:** Replacing serine with the smaller glycine might alleviate the steric clash with thymine's $C5$-methyl, but it creates a non-optimal void. It may not significantly improve binding.\n*   **Phe$\\rightarrow$Trp:** Tryptophan is much bulkier than phenylalanine. This mutation is likely to cause significant steric clashes within the active site for both substrates, impairing binding and catalysis.\n*   **Kinetic predictions vs. analysis:** The prediction that both $K_M$ and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ would improve for both substrates is highly improbable given the mutations. Retaining the Arg clamp means the enzyme will still strongly prefer $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$. The assertion that $K_M$ would decrease for $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$ is questionable, as the other mutations are not specifically designed to improve its binding.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Mutate the catalytic cysteine to serine (Cys$\\rightarrow$Ser) and the guanine clamp arginine to glutamate (Arg$\\rightarrow$Glu), leaving the hydrophobic subsite unchanged.**\n\n*   **Cys$\\rightarrow$Ser:** The catalytic nucleophile is a cysteine thiolate ($\\mathrm{S}^{-}$). A serine's hydroxyl group is much less acidic (higher $\\mathrm{p}K_a$) and its conjugate base, the alkoxide ($\\mathrm{O}^{-}$), is a much poorer nucleophile than thiolate in an $S_N2$ reaction. This mutation would drastically reduce $k_{\\text{cat}}$ for any substrate, effectively inactivating the enzyme. The prediction that $k_{\\text{cat}}$ increases for $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$ is chemically impossible.\n*   **Arg$\\rightarrow$Glu:** This mutation replaces a positively charged H-bond donor with a negatively charged H-bond acceptor. This would create electrostatic repulsion with the electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms of both $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$ and $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$, catastrophically impairing substrate binding for both. This would cause a massive increase in $K_M$ for both substrates. The prediction that $K_M$ decreases for $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$ is directly contradicted by fundamental principles of electrostatics and hydrogen bonding.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only option A describes a rational and consistent protein engineering strategy where all proposed mutations work in concert to achieve the stated goal of switching substrate specificity from $\\mathrm{O6MeG}$ to $\\mathrm{O4MeT}$, with kinetic predictions that are fully supported by the provided biochemical principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2556212"}]}
