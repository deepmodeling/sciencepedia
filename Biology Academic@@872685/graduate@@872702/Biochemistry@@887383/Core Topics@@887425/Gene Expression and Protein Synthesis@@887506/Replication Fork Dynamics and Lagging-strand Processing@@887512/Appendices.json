This first-principles exercise guides you through developing a simple but powerful biophysical model.

On the lagging-strand template, the primase initiates Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) primers stochastically.

Define an Okazaki fragment as the stretch of lagging-strand template replicated between two successive primer initiation events.

It provides a clear, formalizable model based on established principles of stochastic processes applied to molecular biology. The assumptions are explicitly stated, and the question is unambiguous. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the mean Okazaki fragment length, which we will denote as $\\langle L_{\\text{OF}} \\rangle$, based on a simple biophysical model. The cornerstone of this model is the description of primer initiation on the lagging-strand template. This process is posited to be a time-homogeneous Poisson process with a constant rate, or hazard, of $\\lambda$. The replication fork progresses at a constant velocity $v_f$.\n\nA fundamental property of a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ is that the time intervals between successive events are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. These inter-event times follow an exponential distribution. Let $T$ be the random variable representing the time elapsed between two consecutive primer initiation events in the reference frame co-moving with the replication fork. The probability density function (PDF) for $T$, denoted $p(t)$, is given by the exponential distribution:\n$$\np(t) = \\begin{cases} \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)  \\text{for } t \\ge 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{for } t  0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the *mean* Okazaki fragment length. First, we must find the mean time between successive primer initiations, which is the expected value of the random variable $T$, denoted $\\langle T \\rangle$ or $E[T]$. We calculate this by integrating the product of the variable $t$ and its PDF $p(t)$ over all possible values of $t$.\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = E[T] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\cdot p(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\, dt\n$$\nThis integral can be solved using integration by parts, where $\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du$. Let us choose:\n$u = t$, which implies $du = dt$.\n$dv = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\, dt$, which implies $v = \\int \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\, dt = -\\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integration by parts formula yields:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = \\left[ t \\cdot (-\\exp(-\\lambda t)) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (-\\exp(-\\lambda t)) \\, dt\n$$\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = \\left[ -t \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\, dt\n$$\nWe evaluate the first term at the limits of integration. As $t \\to \\infty$, the term $-t \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ approaches $0$ because the exponential decay is faster than the linear growth. At $t=0$, the term is $0$. Thus, the first term is $0$.\n$$\n\\left[ -t \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (-t \\exp(-\\lambda t)) - (-0 \\cdot \\exp(0)) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nNow we evaluate the remaining integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\, dt = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda t)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(0)\\right) = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n$$\nTherefore, the mean time between successive primer initiations is:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe length of an Okazaki fragment, $L$, is defined as the stretch of lagging-strand template replicated between two successive primer initiations. In the time interval $T$ between two initiations, the replication fork moves a distance $v_f T$. This distance corresponds to the length of the unwound single-stranded template that becomes an Okazaki fragment. Thus, the length $L$ is a random variable directly proportional to the time interval $T$:\n$$\nL = v_f T\n$$\nThe problem requests the mean Okazaki fragment length, which is the expected value of $L$, denoted here as $L_{\\text{OF}}$ as per the problem's notation (interpreting $L_{\\text{OF}}$ as the mean value). Using the property of linearity of expectation, we find:\n$$\nL_{\\text{OF}} = \\langle L \\rangle = E[L] = E[v_f T]\n$$\nSince $v_f$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\nL_{\\text{OF}} = v_f E[T] = v_f \\langle T \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\langle T \\rangle$:\n$$\nL_{\\text{OF}} = v_f \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{v_f}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the mean Okazaki fragment length, derived from first principles as required. It shows that the mean length is directly proportional to the fork velocity and inversely proportional to the primer initiation rate, which is a logically consistent and intuitive result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{v_f}{\\lambda}}$$", "id": "2600549"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models gain their power when tested against real-world data.
