This exercise uses the classic biochemical technique of isotopic labeling to trace the journey of nitrogen atoms into urea. By considering a hypothetical scenario where aspartate is labeled with $^{15}N$, you can deduce the distinct origins of the two nitrogen atoms in the final urea molecule, reinforcing the core mechanism of the cycle [@problem_id:2085207].", "problem": "The urea cycle is a critical metabolic pathway in terrestrial vertebrates for the detoxification and excretion of excess nitrogen, primarily derived from amino acid catabolism. The final product, urea, has the chemical formula CO(NH$_{2}$)$_{2}$ and contains two nitrogen atoms. One of these nitrogen atoms is sourced from free ammonia (in the form of carbamoyl phosphate), while the other is supplied by the alpha-amino group of the amino acid aspartate.\n\nConsider a metabolic tracing experiment in which a culture of liver cells is supplied with a specially synthesized batch of aspartate. In this batch, the nitrogen atom of the alpha-amino group has been isotopically labeled with $^{15}$N, while all other atoms in the system, including the nitrogen in free ammonia, are the common $^{14}$N isotope. After allowing the urea cycle to proceed, a sample of the newly synthesized urea is isolated and analyzed. Which of the following statements correctly describes the labeling pattern observed in the resulting urea molecules?\n\nA. The nitrogen atom derived from free ammonia will be labeled with $^{15}$N.\n\nB. The nitrogen atom derived from the aspartate molecule will be labeled with $^{15}$N.\n\nC. Both nitrogen atoms in the urea molecule will be equally labeled with $^{15}$N.\n\nD. The labeling will be randomly distributed, with a 50% chance for either nitrogen atom to be labeled.\n\nE. Neither nitrogen atom in the urea molecule will be labeled, as the labeled group is lost before incorporation.", "solution": "We must identify which nitrogen in urea originates from which precursor in the urea cycle and then apply the isotopic labeling described.\n\nThe urea cycle incorporates two nitrogen atoms into urea. One nitrogen comes from free ammonia via carbamoyl phosphate, and the other comes from the alpha-amino group of aspartate. In the experiment, only the alpha-amino nitrogen of aspartate is labeled as ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$; the ammonia pool and all other atoms are ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$.\n\nStep-by-step tracing:\n1) Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I reaction:\n$${}^{14}\\mathrm{NH_{3}} + \\mathrm{HCO_{3}^{-}} + 2\\ \\mathrm{ATP} \\to \\text{carbamoyl phosphate with }{}^{14}\\mathrm{N}.$$\nThus, the nitrogen of carbamoyl phosphate is ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n2) Ornithine transcarbamylase:\nCarbamoyl phosphate transfers its carbamoyl group to ornithine to form citrulline. The ureido group nitrogen in citrulline remains the one from free ammonia and is ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n3) Argininosuccinate synthetase:\nCitrulline condenses with aspartate, incorporating the alpha-amino nitrogen of aspartate into the guanidino group of argininosuccinate. Since the alpha-amino nitrogen of aspartate is ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, this newly incorporated nitrogen is ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n4) Argininosuccinate lyase:\nArgininosuccinate is cleaved to arginine and fumarate. The arginine guanidino group now contains two nitrogens: one ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ from the original carbamoyl phosphate (via citrulline) and one ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ from aspartate.\n\n5) Arginase:\nArginine is hydrolyzed to urea and ornithine. The urea inherits both guanidino nitrogens from arginine: one ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ (derived from ammonia) and one ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ (derived from aspartate). There is no scrambling step in the cycle that would randomize or exchange these nitrogens under the described conditions.\n\nTherefore, in the isolated urea, the nitrogen derived from aspartate will be labeled with ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, while the nitrogen derived from free ammonia will remain ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$.

When presented with severe hyperammonemia, a clinician must distinguish between various potential defects. This practice challenges you to predict the distinct metabolic fingerprints of a deficiency in the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I ($CPS1$) versus its obligatory activator, $N$-acetylglutamate synthase ($NAGS$), highlighting how understanding regulation is key to differential diagnosis [@problem_id:2612848].", "problem": "A hepatology laboratory receives samples from two neonates with severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy, each suspected of having a single-enzyme defect in ammonium detoxification. Investigators can assay three readouts: plasma ammonia, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate in liver homogenate, and urinary orotic acid. One neonate has a confirmed isolated deficiency of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1), and the other has a confirmed isolated deficiency of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS). You are asked to predict, for each disorder, the qualitative direction of change of the three readouts relative to normal and provide a mechanistic rationale.\n\nUse only the following foundational bases that are well established:\n- In hepatocytes, the urea cycle initiates in mitochondria where carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from free ammonia and bicarbonate, but this reaction requires the obligatory allosteric activator N-acetylglutamate (NAG), which is synthesized by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) from glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A.\n- Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) condenses mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate with ornithine to form citrulline. Failure downstream of CPS1 can lead to mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate accumulation that may leak into the cytosol.\n- De novo pyrimidine synthesis occurs in the cytosol and employs carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPS2), which is a distinct enzyme from CPS1 and does not use free ammonia; cytosolic carbamoyl phosphate is the precursor to orotic acid.\n- Orotic acid in urine primarily reflects flux of carbamoyl phosphate into the cytosolic pyrimidine pathway; mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate only contributes if it accumulates and escapes the mitochondrion.\n\nWhich option best predicts the metabolic phenotypes and gives a correct mechanistic justification?\n\nA. CPS1 deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate decreased, urinary orotic acid normal to decreased. NAGS deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate decreased, urinary orotic acid normal to decreased. Mechanism: in CPS1 deficiency the catalytic capacity to form mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate is impaired; in NAGS deficiency CPS1 lacks its obligatory activator and is effectively inactive.

CPS1 deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate increased, urinary orotic acid increased.

Mechanism: CPS1 deficiency causes substrate accumulation that drives carbamoyl phosphate formation via CPS2 and leaks back to mitochondria, raising orotic acid; NAGS deficiency reduces CPS1 flux only.\n\nC. CPS1 deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate decreased, urinary orotic acid increased due to compensatory upregulation of cytosolic pyrimidine synthesis.

NAGS deficiency: ammonia increased with normal mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate and normal urinary orotic acid. Mechanism: CPS1 can be activated by alternative effectors, whereas NAGS deficiency does not alter carbamoyl phosphate availability.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The problem requires a prediction of the metabolic consequences of two distinct enzymatic defects, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) deficiency and N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency, based on a set of foundational biochemical principles. The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions or missing data that would invalidate the premise. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe urea cycle is the primary pathway for detoxification of ammonia, which is neurotoxic at high concentrations. The initial steps of this cycle occur within the mitochondrial matrix of hepatocytes. The provided principles establish the following sequence of events under normal conditions:\n\n$1$. N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) synthesizes N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A.\n$$ \\text{Glutamate} + \\text{Acetyl-CoA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{NAGS}} \\text{N-acetylglutamate (NAG)} $$\n$2$. NAG functions as an obligatory allosteric activator for carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1).\n$3$. Activated CPS1 catalyzes the condensation of ammonia ($NH_4^+$) and bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) to form carbamoyl phosphate (CP). This is the first committed step of the urea cycle.\n$$ NH_4^+ + HCO_3^- + 2ATP \\xrightarrow{\\text{CPS1 (activated by NAG)}} \\text{Carbamoyl Phosphate} + 2ADP + \\mathrm{P_i} $$\n$4$. Mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate is then consumed by ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) to form citrulline.\n$$ \\text{Carbamoyl Phosphate} + \\text{Ornithine} \\xrightarrow{\\text{OTC}} \\text{Citrulline} $$\n$5$. A separate, cytosolic pathway for pyrimidine synthesis utilizes a different enzyme, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPS2), which does not use free ammonia. Accumulation of mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate can lead to its leakage into the cytosol, where it enters the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, resulting in increased production and excretion of orotic acid.\n\nWe will now analyze the two pathological conditions.\n\n**Case 1: Isolated Deficiency of Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I (CPS1)**\n\nA deficiency in the CPS1 enzyme means that the protein itself is non-functional or has severely reduced catalytic capacity.\n*   **Plasma Ammonia**: CPS1 catalyzes the first entry point of free ammonia into the urea cycle. A defect in this enzyme directly blocks ammonia detoxification. Consequently, ammonia derived from amino acid catabolism accumulates in the blood, leading to severe hyperammonemia. The prediction is that plasma ammonia will be **increased**.\n*   **Mitochondrial Carbamoyl Phosphate**: CPS1 is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate. If the enzyme is deficient, the rate of synthesis of its product will be drastically reduced, regardless of the availability of substrates ($NH_4^+$, $HCO_3^-$) or the activator (NAG). Thus, the mitochondrial concentration of carbamoyl phosphate will be **decreased**.\n*   **Urinary Orotic Acid**: Increased urinary orotic acid in the context of urea cycle defects arises from the accumulation of mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate, its subsequent leakage into the cytosol, and its entry into the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. In CPS1 deficiency, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate levels are low, not high. Therefore, there is no spillover to the cytosol. Urinary orotic acid levels are expected to be **normal to decreased**.\n\n**Case 2: Isolated Deficiency of N-acetylglutamate Synthase (NAGS)**\n\nA deficiency in NAGS prevents the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate (NAG).\n*   **Plasma Ammonia**: The problem explicitly states that NAG is an *obligatory* allosteric activator of CPS1. Without NAG, the CPS1 enzyme, although structurally normal, is functionally inactive. The metabolic block is functionally identical to a primary CPS1 deficiency: ammonia cannot be incorporated into the urea cycle. This will lead to severe hyperammonemia. The prediction is that plasma ammonia will be **increased**.\n*   **Mitochondrial Carbamoyl Phosphate**: With CPS1 being inactive due to the absence of its activator, the synthesis of mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate is blocked. The result is the same as in CPS1 deficiency: the concentration of mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate will be **decreased**.\n*   **Urinary Orotic Acid**: As in CPS1 deficiency, the level of mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate is low. There is no accumulation and thus no leakage into the cytosol to drive orotic acid synthesis. Urinary orotic acid levels are expected to be **normal to decreased**.\n\nIn summary, both CPS1 deficiency and NAGS deficiency result in an identical metabolic profile for the three measured variables: increased plasma ammonia, decreased mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate, and normal to decreased urinary orotic acid.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options:\n\n**A. CPS1 deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate decreased, urinary orotic acid normal to decreased. NAGS deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate decreased, urinary orotic acid normal to decreased. Mechanism: in CPS1 deficiency the catalytic capacity to form mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate is impaired; in NAGS deficiency CPS1 lacks its obligatory activator and is effectively inactive. In neither case does mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate accumulate to feed cytosolic pyrimidine synthesis, and cytosolic CPS2 is compartmentally separate.**\n\nThis option's predictions for both disorders are identical to my derived results. The mechanistic explanation is precise and accurate. It correctly identifies that CPS1 deficiency is a lack of the enzyme itself, while NAGS deficiency leads to a lack of the enzyme's activator. It correctly concludes that both scenarios lead to a failure to produce mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate, thereby preventing orotic aciduria. This statement is fully consistent with the provided principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. CPS1 deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate increased, urinary orotic acid increased. NAGS deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate decreased, urinary orotic acid decreased. Mechanism: CPS1 deficiency causes substrate accumulation that drives carbamoyl phosphate formation via CPS2 and leaks back to mitochondria, raising orotic acid; NAGS deficiency reduces CPS1 flux only.**\n\nThis option incorrectly predicts that mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate and urinary orotic acid are increased in CPS1 deficiency. A defect in an enzyme that *produces* a compound leads to a decrease, not an increase, of that compound. The mechanism proposed is also flawed; CPS2 does not use free ammonia and the concept of carbamoyl phosphate leaking from cytosol to mitochondria to cause orotic aciduria is biochemically nonsensical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. CPS1 deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate decreased, urinary orotic acid increased due to compensatory upregulation of cytosolic pyrimidine synthesis. NAGS deficiency: ammonia increased, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate increased, urinary orotic acid increased because lack of NAG causes carbamoyl phosphate to divert to cytosol.**\n\nThis option incorrectly predicts increased urinary orotic acid in CPS1 deficiency, attributing it to a vague \"compensatory upregulation\" for which no basis is provided. For NAGS deficiency, it incorrectly predicts that mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate would be increased; the lack of the activator NAG *prevents* its synthesis. The premise that lack of NAG causes diversion is illogical, as there is no carbamoyl phosphate to divert.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. CPS1 deficiency: ammonia near normal due to activation by residual NAG; mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate normal; urinary orotic acid decreased. NAGS deficiency: ammonia increased with normal mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate and normal urinary orotic acid. Mechanism: CPS1 can be activated by alternative effectors, whereas NAGS deficiency does not alter carbamoyl phosphate availability.**\n\nThis option incorrectly suggests that ammonia would be near normal in CPS1 deficiency, which contradicts the given clinical context of \"severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy.\" It also incorrectly states that mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate is normal in both conditions. The mechanism contradicts the provided principles by suggesting \"alternative effectors\" for an \"obligatory\" activator and by incorrectly claiming that NAGS deficiency does not alter carbamoyl phosphate synthesis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nTherefore, only option A accurately describes the metabolic phenotypes and their underlying mechanisms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2612848"}, {"introduction": "Metabolic pathways are not isolated systems; they are deeply integrated into the cell's overall energy economy.

Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I in the mitochondrial matrix uses bicarbonate and free ammonium to form carbamoyl phosphate.

It provides all necessary information to compute a unique, meaningful solution. We shall proceed with the calculation of the net energetic cost of urea synthesis under the specified conditions.\n\nThe objective is to determine the net expenditure of adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$) equivalents per molecule of urea synthesized. This requires a careful accounting of all steps that consume $ATP$ and all interconnected steps that regenerate $ATP$. The net cost is the difference between the total $ATP$ equivalents consumed and the total $ATP$ equivalents produced.\n\nLet us first quantify the consumption of $ATP$ equivalents during one turn of the urea cycle. The cycle involves two enzymatic steps that require direct energy input from $ATP$.\n\n1. The reaction catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) in the mitochondrial matrix. The problem states that this reaction consumes two molecules of ATP. This corresponds to the cleavage of two high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.\nCost from CPS1 = 2 ATP equivalents.\n\n2.

The problem correctly defines the total process ($ATP \\rightarrow AMP + 2\\,\\mathrm{P_i}$) as being equivalent to the hydrolysis of two high-energy bonds. Thus, this step costs $2$ $ATP$ equivalents.\nCost from argininosuccinate synthetase = 2 ATP equivalents.\n\nThe total gross expenditure of $ATP$ equivalents per turn of the urea cycle is the sum of the costs from these two steps.\n$$ \\text{Total Gross Cost} = 2 + 2 = 4 \\text{ ATP equivalents} $$\n\nNext, we must account for the regeneration of $ATP$ that is coupled to the urea cycle. The cycle releases the carbon skeleton of aspartate as fumarate.\n$$ \\text{Argininosuccinate} \\rightarrow \\text{Arginine} + \\text{Fumarate} $$\nThis fumarate molecule provides a direct link to the citric acid cycle and cellular respiration, allowing for energy recovery.\n\n1.

The problem provides the energetic yield for this process: each cytosolic $NADH$ produces $2.5$ $ATP$ equivalents.\n\nTherefore, the amount of $ATP$ regenerated per molecule of urea synthesized is:\n$$ \\text{Total ATP Regenerated} = 1 \\text{ molecule of NADH} \\times \\frac{2.5 \\text{ ATP equivalents}}{1 \\text{ molecule of NADH}} = 2.5 \\text{ ATP equivalents} $$\n\nFinally, the net ATP expenditure is the total gross cost minus the total $ATP$ regenerated.\n$$ \\text{Net ATP Expenditure} = \\text{Total Gross Cost} - \\text{Total ATP Regenerated} $$\n$$ \\text{Net ATP Expenditure} = 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 \\text{ ATP equivalents} $$\n\nThus, for each molecule of urea synthesized, there is a net cost of $1.5$ $ATP$ equivalents when the energetic recovery from fumarate is taken into account.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.5}$$", "id": "2612861"}]}
