This will be accomplished in three steps as requested.\n\na) Derivation of the balanced stoichiometric equations for the GS and GOGAT reactions.\n\nFirst, we consider the Glutamine Synthetase (GS) reaction. The problem states that GS catalyzes the $\\text{ATP}$-dependent amidation of L-glutamate using ammonium ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$) to produce L-glutamine, with $\\text{ADP}$ and inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$) as byproducts.

The conversion of the carboxylate group of L-glutamate to the neutral amide group of L-glutamine, starting from $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$, results in the net release of a proton. The reaction is properly balanced as:\n$$ \\text{L-glutamate} + \\mathrm{NH_4^+} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{L-glutamine} + \\text{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_i} + \\mathrm{H^+} $$\nThis equation is balanced for all atoms and for net charge.\n\nSecond, we consider the Glutamate Synthase (GOGAT) reaction.

The problem specifies that one of the L-glutamate molecules produced by GOGAT is used as the substrate for the GS reaction, making it an intermediate in the cycle.

Under carbon- and energy-limited steady-state biosynthesis, assume the cell executes the following coarse-grained modules and stoichiometries, which aggregate elementary steps into well-tested net conversions:\n\n- Central carbon modules:\n  - Glycolysis-to-phosphoenolpyruvate module: one mole of glucose is converted to two moles of phosphoenolpyruvate ($\\text{PEP}$) with net adenosine triphosphate ($\\text{ATP}$) production equal to zero and production of two moles of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($\\text{NADH}$). Formally, write this as a bookkeeping identity: one mole of glucose supplies two moles of PEP at zero net ATP.

Assume glucose uptake and phosphorylation have no net ATP cost and do not consume PEP, and that the non-oxidative PPP can rearrange the pentose pool into the required erythrose-4-phosphate ($\\text{E4P}$) with no ATP or NADPH cost, returning any excess carbon to the glycolytic intermediate pool.\n\n- Shikimate and aromatic branch modules:\n  - From E4P and PEP to chorismate: one mole of E4P and two moles of PEP yield one mole of chorismate, consuming one mole of ATP (at shikimate kinase) and two moles of NADPH (one at shikimate dehydrogenase and one to reduce flavin mononucleotide for chorismate synthase). No net carbon is lost in this segment.\n  - From chorismate to phenylalanine: the chorismate-to-phenylalanine branch loses one mole of carbon dioxide at the prephenate dehydratase step to phenylpyruvate, then incorporates one amino nitrogen into phenylalanine by transamination. Assume ammonium is assimilated via glutamate dehydrogenase; the net reductant cost to install the single amino group on phenylpyruvate is one mole of NADPH and zero ATP. There are no additional ATP costs in the branch to phenylalanine.\n\nAdditional global simplifications:\n- All reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) must be supplied by the oxidative PPP; there is no nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) transhydrogenation.\n- All non-oxidative PPP rearrangements and carbon interconversions among sugar phosphates are ATP- and NAD(P)H-neutral.\n- Ignore maintenance energy and any ATP or PEP costs of glucose uptake; ignore the fate of NADH (assume it is reoxidized without ATP consequences).\n- Phenylalanine has nine carbons.

Downstream, the first committed enzyme of the lysine branch, dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), is inhibited by lysine; the homoserine branch leading to threonine and methionine is regulated by threonine inhibiting homoserine dehydrogenase and by S-adenosylmethionine ($\\text{SAM}$) inhibiting homoserine O-succinyltransferase. Assume no substrate channeling and that both AK isoenzymes draw from the same aspartate pool.\n\nLet the common-node flux through AK be $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$, and the branch fluxes to lysine, threonine, and methionine be $J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$, $J_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$, and $J_{\\mathrm{Met}}$, respectively, so that the steady-state mass balance is\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{AK}} = J_{\\mathrm{Lys}} + J_{\\mathrm{Thr}} + J_{\\mathrm{Met}}.\n$$\nDefine the branch fractions as $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}} = J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}/J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$, $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}} = J_{\\mathrm{Thr}}/J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$, and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}} = J_{\\mathrm{Met}}/J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$.\n\nConsider a mutant in which AK$_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ is deleted, leaving only AK$_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$.

The steady-state mass balance is given as $J_{\\mathrm{AK}} = J_{\\mathrm{Lys}} + J_{\\mathrm{Thr}} + J_{\\mathrm{Met}}$. The branch fractions are defined as $f_i = J_i / J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$.\n\nWe must compare the response of two systems to a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of lysine:\n1.  **Wild Type (WT):** Possesses two AK isoenzymes. AK$_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ is inhibited by lysine, and AK$_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ is inhibited by threonine. The total flux is $J_{\\mathrm{AK}} = J_{\\mathrm{AK,Lys}} + J_{\\mathrm{AK,Thr}}$. Additionally, the first enzyme of the lysine branch, DHDPS, is inhibited by lysine.\n2.  **Mutant:** The gene for AK$_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ is deleted. Only AK$_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ is present. The total flux is $J_{\\mathrm{AK}} = J_{\\mathrm{AK,Thr}}$. DHDPS is still inhibited by lysine.\n\nLet us analyze the response of each system to a transient elevation in lysine concentration.\n\n**Analysis of the Wild Type (WT) System:**\nWhen the concentration of lysine rises, two key enzymes are inhibited:\n1.  **AK$_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$:** As an allosteric inhibitor, lysine reduces the activity of AK$_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$. This directly reduces its contribution to the total flux, $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$.\n2.  **DHDPS:** Lysine inhibits the first committed step of its own branch. This directly reduces the flux into the lysine branch, $J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$.\n\nThe combined effect is a coordinated downregulation. The total flux $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ decreases because one of its contributing isoenzymes is inhibited. The specific branch flux $J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ also decreases due to inhibition of DHDPS. The flux fraction to lysine, $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}} = J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}/J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$, will decrease. Although both numerator and denominator decrease, the dual inhibition (at the common node and branch point) ensures a strong reduction in flux towards lysine relative to the other branches. Consequently, to satisfy the conservation of fractions ($\\sum f_i = 1$), the fractions for the other branches, $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}}$, must increase. This is an efficient regulatory mechanism where an excess of one product reduces both the total pathway input and its own branch's draw on the common pool.\n\n**Analysis of the Mutant System:**\nThe mutant lacks AK$_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$. The common-node flux is produced solely by AK$_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$, which is insensitive to lysine.\nWhen the concentration of lysine rises:\n1.  **AK$_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$:** The activity of the only AK enzyme present is **not** affected by the elevated lysine.\n2.  **DHDPS:** Lysine still inhibits DHDPS, reducing the flux into the lysine branch, $J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$.\n\nThe critical difference lies in the response of the total flux, $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$. In the mutant, the feedback loop from lysine to the common node is broken. As lysine levels rise, $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ is not immediately downregulated. However, $J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ is still repressed due to DHDPS inhibition.\nThis creates a metabolic imbalance: the common-node enzyme continues to produce aspartyl phosphate at a high rate, while the \"exit\" to the lysine branch is being constricted.\nThe consequences are:\n*   **Total Flux, $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$:** Relative to the WT, where $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ would decrease, the mutant's $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ remains high. This lack of downregulation can be considered a dysregulation, leading to an inappropriately high flux for the given metabolic state.\n*   **Flux Partitioning:**\n    *   The flux to lysine, $J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$, decreases due to DHDPS inhibition.\n    *   The flux fraction to lysine, $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}} = J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}/J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$, decreases significantly because the numerator ($J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$) drops while the denominator ($J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$) remains high.\n    *   Due to mass balance ($J_{\\mathrm{AK}} = J_{\\mathrm{Lys}} + J_{\\mathrm{Thr}} + J_{\\mathrm{Met}}$), the undiminished total flux $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ must be diverted elsewhere as $J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ falls. This \"spillover\" flux is channeled into the homoserine branch, causing $J_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ and $J_{\\mathrm{Met}}$ to increase.\n    *   Consequently, the branch fractions $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}}$ must increase to compensate for the decrease in $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$.\n\nThis spillover will eventually lead to an accumulation of threonine and/or methionine (via SAM), which will then provide feedback inhibition to downregulate AK$_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ and other enzymes in the homoserine branch. However, the initial, primary effect of the mutation during a lysine spike is the diversion of an inappropriately high total flux into the non-lysine branches.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A. $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ decreases while $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}}$ increase; $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ increases because lysine can no longer inhibit the common node through AK, so excess common-node flux is diverted into the homoserine branch until threonine or methionine feedbacks engage.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n-   **Partitioning:** \"$f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ decreases while $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}}$ increase\" is correct.\n-   **Total Flux:** The phrase \"$J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ increases\" is a reasonable, albeit slightly imprecise, way to describe the failure of the flux to be downregulated as it would be in the wild type. It represents a relative increase compared to the regulated state. The reason given—\"lysine can no longer inhibit the common node\"—is precisely the correct mechanism.\n-   **Diversion:** The description of \"excess common-node flux is diverted into the homoserine branch\" is also correct.\nThis option provides the most accurate and complete qualitative description.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ increases while $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}}$ decrease; $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ decreases because total AK capacity is reduced by the deletion and lysine no longer restrains its own branch at the common node.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple points.\n-   **Partitioning:** \"$f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ increases\" is incorrect. High lysine inhibits an enzyme in the lysine branch (DHDPS), which must decrease $J_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ and thus $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$.\n-   **Total Flux:** \"$J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ decreases\" because of reduced capacity is a statement about the baseline state, not the dynamic response to the lysine perturbation. The critical feature of the mutant's response is the *lack* of a decrease in $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ due to high lysine.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$, $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$, and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}}$ are unchanged; only $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ decreases because fewer AK molecules are present, and downstream feedbacks fully preserve partitioning.**\nThis statement is incorrect.\n-   **Partitioning:** The claim that fractions are \"unchanged\" is false. Inhibition of DHDPS by lysine necessarily alters the flux distribution, causing partitioning to change.\n-   **Total Flux:** The reasoning for a decrease in $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ is flawed, as explained for option B.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ increases and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}}$ decreases due to altered regulation of the homoserine branch, $f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ unchanged; $J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ is unchanged by homeostatic compensation at downstream steps.**\nThis statement is incorrect.\n-   **Partitioning:** The claim \"$f_{\\mathrm{Lys}}$ unchanged\" is false, as DHDPS inhibition by lysine directly affects this branch. The claim that $f_{\\mathrm{Thr}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{Met}}$ move in opposite directions is a level of detail not supported by the primary effect, which is a diversion of flux into the entire homoserine branch.\n-   **Total Flux:** While \"$J_{\\mathrm{AK}}$ is unchanged\" is partially correct regarding the initial response to lysine, the reasoning is vague, and the incorrect claims about partitioning make the option invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of feedback inhibition principles, Option A provides the correct qualitative prediction of the mutant system's behavior.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2547127"}]}
