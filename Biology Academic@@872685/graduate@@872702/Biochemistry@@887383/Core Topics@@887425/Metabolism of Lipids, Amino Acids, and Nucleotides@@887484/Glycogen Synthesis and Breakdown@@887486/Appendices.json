The roles of glycogenin as a primer, glycogen synthase in elongation, and branching enzyme are fundamental concepts. The experimental design, involving a catalytically inactive mutant and a glycogen depletion/repletion protocol, is a standard and valid method for studying *de novo* synthesis pathways in cell biology.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The initial state (glycogen-depleted), the specific genetic perturbation (catalytically dead glycogenin), and the controlled environment (ample substrate, normal downstream enzymes) are clearly defined. This allows for a unique, qualitative prediction based on established principles.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is precise and technical, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe synthesis of glycogen occurs in distinct stages, starting with initiation, followed by elongation and branching. The problem centers on the initiation step, which is a prerequisite for all subsequent processes.\n\n$1$. **Initiation of Glycogen Synthesis:** *De novo* synthesis of a glycogen particle is initiated by the protein glycogenin. Glycogenin is a dimeric protein that functions as a glycosyltransferase. The process begins with the autocatalyzed glucosylation of a specific tyrosine residue (Tyr-194) within each glycogenin subunit. Glycogenin catalyzes the transfer of a glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group of this tyrosine residue. It then proceeds to extend this initial glucose by adding approximately 7-11 more glucose residues in $\\alpha(1 \\rightarrow 4)$ linkages, forming a short oligosaccharide primer that remains covalently attached to the protein. Each such primed glycogenin molecule serves as the nucleus for a new glycogen particle. Therefore, the number of glycogen particles in a cell is fundamentally determined by the number of functional, primer-synthesizing glycogenin molecules.\n\n$2$. **Elongation and Branching:** Once the primer is formed by glycogenin, glycogen synthase takes over the process of elongation. Glycogen synthase requires a pre-existing primer of at least 4 glucose residues; it is incapable of initiating a new chain *de novo*. It extends the glycogen chain by adding glucose units from UDP-glucose via $\\alpha(1 \\rightarrow 4)$ glycosidic bonds. Concurrently, the glycogen branching enzyme (amylo-($1,4 \\rightarrow 1,6$)-transglycosylase) acts on the growing linear chains, transferring segments of about 7 glucose residues to form $\\alpha(1 \\rightarrow 6)$ branch points.\n\n$3$. **Analysis of the Mutant:** The problem states that the engineered cells express a catalytically dead mutant of glycogenin that \"cannot autoglucosylate its active-site tyrosine.\" This mutation strikes at the heart of the initiation process. Without the initial autocatalyzed glucosylation, glycogenin cannot create the oligosaccharide primer. The experimental protocol ensures this defect is critical by first depleting all pre-existing glycogen, which might otherwise provide alternative primers, and conducting the refeeding in a \"primer-free medium.\" The downstream machinery, glycogen synthase and branching enzyme, along with the substrate UDP-glucose, are all present and normal. However, in the complete absence of a primer, this machinery is inert. Glycogen synthase has no glucose chain to extend.\n\n$4$. **Predicted Outcome:** Given that the formation of the primer is completely blocked, *de novo* synthesis of glycogen cannot start.\n- **Particle Number:** Since each particle requires a primed glycogenin core, and no such cores can be formed, the number of new glycogen particles will be near-zero.\n- **Glycogen Content:** As no particles are initiated, there are no chains for glycogen synthase to elongate or for branching enzyme to act upon. Consequently, there can be no significant accumulation of polysaccharide. The total glycogen content of the cell will be near-abolished.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Near-abolished glycogen content and a near-zero particle number, because glycogen synthase and branching enzyme cannot initiate de novo polymerization without a primer.**\nThis statement is a correct and precise description of the predicted outcome. The catalytically dead glycogenin fails to provide the primer, and because glycogen synthase cannot initiate synthesis *de novo*, the entire pathway is halted at its first step. This leads to a near-complete absence of both glycogen particles and total glycogen mass.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Roughly normal total glycogen content but a reduced particle number with compensatory enlargement of the remaining particles.**\nThis is incorrect. The premise of the experiment is the study of *de novo* synthesis after depletion of pre-existing glycogen. There should be no \"remaining particles\" to enlarge. Even if the depletion were imperfect, the central defect—an inability to initiate *new* particles—would prevent the synthesis of a \"roughly normal total glycogen content.\" This outcome would require functional initiation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Increased particle number and total glycogen content, because accumulation of nonfunctional glycogenin nucleates additional initiation sites.**\nThis is scientifically unsound. A nonfunctional, catalytically dead protein cannot nucleate a biochemical process for which it provides the essential catalytic first step. The accumulation of inactive glycogenin does not create initiation sites; on the contrary, its inactivity prevents their formation. This would lead to a decrease, not an increase, in particle number and content.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Reduced total glycogen content but an unchanged particle number, because glycogen synthase can initiate chains de novo in the absence of a protein primer while branching enzyme determines particle count.**\nThis statement contains two major factual errors in biochemistry. First, glycogen synthase absolutely cannot initiate chains *de novo*; its requirement for a primer is one of its defining characteristics. Second, the glycogen branching enzyme does not determine particle number; it modifies the structure of existing particles. The number of particles is determined by glycogenin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2567955"}, {"introduction": "Once initiated, the rate of glycogen synthesis is tightly controlled to match the cell's metabolic state.
