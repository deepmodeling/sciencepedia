This means its rate of change is approximately zero:\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1[E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[ES] = 0$$\nwhere $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ are the rate constants for substrate binding, dissociation, and catalysis, respectively.

The problem specifies that $S_{f} = 0.9 S_{0}$.\nThus, $\\Delta P = S_{0} - 0.9 S_{0} = 0.1 S_{0}$.\nThe expression for the estimated rate becomes:\n$$\\hat{v}_{0} = \\frac{0.1 S_{0}}{\\Delta t}$$\n\nTo find $\\Delta t$, we must integrate the Michaelis–Menten differential rate equation. We rearrange the equation to separate the variables $S$ and $t$:\n$$-\\frac{K_{M} + [S]}{[S]} d[S] = V_{\\max} dt$$\n$$-\\left(\\frac{K_{M}}{[S]} + 1\\right) d[S] = V_{\\max} dt$$\nWe integrate both sides over the time interval from $t=0$ to $t=\\Delta t$, during which the substrate concentration changes from $S_{0}$ to $S_{f}$:\n$$\\int_{S_{0}}^{S_{f}} -\\left(\\frac{K_{M}}{[S]} + 1\\right) d[S] = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} V_{\\max} dt$$\nTo remove the negative sign, we can reverse the limits of integration on the left side:\n$$\\int_{S_{f}}^{S_{0}} \\left(\\frac{K_{M}}{[S]} + 1\\right) d[S] = V_{\\max} \\Delta t$$\nPerforming the integration gives the progress curve equation:\n$$[K_{M} \\ln([S]) + [S]]_{S_{f}}^{S_{0}} = V_{\\max} \\Delta t$$\n$$(K_{M} \\ln(S_{0}) + S_{0}) - (K_{M} \\ln(S_{f}) + S_{f}) = V_{\\max} \\Delta t$$\n$$K_{M} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{0}}{S_{f}}\\right) + (S_{0} - S_{f}) = V_{\\max} \\Delta t$$\nFrom this, we can express $\\Delta t$ as:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ K_{M} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{0}}{S_{f}}\\right) + S_{0} - S_{f} \\right]$$\nNow, we substitute the specific conditions of the problem: $S_{0} = K_{M}$ and $S_{f} = 0.9 S_{0}$.\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ K_{M} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{0}}{0.9 S_{0}}\\right) + S_{0} - 0.9 S_{0} \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ K_{M} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.9}\\right) + 0.1 S_{0} \\right]$$\nSince $S_{0} = K_{M}$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ K_{M} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.9}\\right) + 0.1 K_{M} \\right] = \\frac{K_{M}}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.9}\\right) + 0.1 \\right]$$\n\nNow we can calculate $\\hat{v}_{0}$ by substituting this expression for $\\Delta t$ and using $S_{0} = K_{M}$:\n$$\\hat{v}_{0} = \\frac{0.1 S_{0}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{0.1 K_{M}}{\\frac{K_{M}}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.9}\\right) + 0.1 \\right]}$$\n$$\\hat{v}_{0} = \\frac{0.1 V_{\\max}}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.9}\\right) + 0.1}$$\n\nFinally, we derive the expression for the relative error, $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\\varepsilon \\equiv \\frac{\\hat{v}_{0} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{\\hat{v}_{0}}{v_{0}} - 1$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\hat{v}_{0}$ and $v_{0}$:\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\frac{0.1 V_{\\max}}{\\ln(1/0.9) + 0.1}}{\\frac{V_{\\max}}{2}} - 1$$\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{2 \\times 0.1 V_{\\max}}{V_{\\max} (\\ln(1/0.9) + 0.1)} - 1$$\nThe $V_{\\max}$ terms cancel, leading to a dimensionless expression for the error, as expected:\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{0.2}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.9}\\right) + 0.1} - 1$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we evaluate this expression. Note that $\\ln(1/0.9) = \\ln(10/9)$.\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right) \\approx 0.10536051565$$\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{0.2}{0.10536051565 + 0.1} - 1 = \\frac{0.2}{0.20536051565} - 1$$\n$$\\varepsilon \\approx 0.9738960007 - 1 = -0.0261039993$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\varepsilon \\approx -0.02610$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the estimated rate is an underestimate of the true initial rate, which is physically correct because the rate decreases as the substrate is depleted.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.02610}$$", "id": "2607486"}]}
