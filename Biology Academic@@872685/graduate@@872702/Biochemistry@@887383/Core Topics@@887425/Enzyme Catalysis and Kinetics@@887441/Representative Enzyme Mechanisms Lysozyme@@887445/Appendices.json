It presents a standard, solvable problem in biochemistry concerning enzyme kinetics and acid-base chemistry. All necessary data and assumptions are provided. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part answer: first, a derivation of the fraction of the protonated form of a monoprotic acid; second, a calculation of this fraction for the Glu35 side chain at a specific pH; and third, a mechanistic explanation of this result in the context of the enzyme's optimal activity.\n\nLet the protonated form of the glutamic acid side chain be denoted as $HA$ and the deprotonated (conjugate base) form as $A^{-}$. The acid dissociation equilibrium is:\n$$HA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-}$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, is defined by the equilibrium expression:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$$\nwhere $[H^{+}]$, $[A^{-}]$, and $[HA]$ represent the molar concentrations of the protons, the deprotonated species, and the protonated species, respectively. The problem states to assume ideal behavior, so activities are equal to concentrations.\n\nThe total concentration of the Glu35 side chains, $[A]_{total}$, is the sum of the concentrations of the protonated and deprotonated forms:\n$$[A]_{total} = [HA] + [A^{-}]$$\nThe fraction of Glu35 that is in the protonated form, which we will denote as $\\alpha_{HA}$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the protonated form to the total concentration:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{[HA]}{[A]_{total}} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}$$\nTo express this fraction as a function of $[H^{+}]$ and $K_{a}$, we first rearrange the $K_{a}$ expression to solve for $[A^{-}]$:\n$$[A^{-}] = K_{a} \\frac{[HA]}{[H^{+}]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[A^{-}]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\alpha_{HA}$:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + K_{a} \\frac{[HA]}{[H^{+}]}}$$\nThe term $[HA]$ is common to all terms in the expression and can be factored out from the denominator and cancelled:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_{a}}{[H^{+}]} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_{a}}{[H^{+}]}}$$\nTo eliminate the compound fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[H^{+}]$:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{[H^{+}]}{[H^{+}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_{a}}{[H^{+}]} \\right)} = \\frac{[H^{+}]}{[H^{+}] + K_{a}}$$\nThis expression gives the fraction of the acid in its protonated form as a function of $[H^{+}]$ and $K_{a}$. The problem requires the expression in terms of pH and $\\text{p}K_a$. We use the definitions:\n$$\\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}]) \\implies [H^{+}] = 10^{-\\text{pH}}$$\n$$\\text{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_{a}) \\implies K_{a} = 10^{-\\text{p}K_a}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\alpha_{HA}$:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{10^{-\\text{pH}}}{10^{-\\text{pH}} + 10^{-\\text{p}K_a}}$$\nTo obtain a more conventional form, which is also derivable from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by $10^{-\\text{pH}}$:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-\\text{p}K_a}}{10^{-\\text{pH}}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\text{pH} - \\text{p}K_a}}$$\nThis is the required derived expression for the fraction of Glu35 in the protonated form as a function of pH and $\\text{p}K_a$.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this fraction for Glu35 at pH 5.2. The problem provides the $\\text{p}K_a$ of the Glu35 side chain as $6.2$.\nSubstituting the given values into our derived expression:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{5.2 - 6.2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-1.0}}$$\nSince $10^{-1.0} = 0.1$, the calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{1}{1.1}$$\nPerforming the division and rounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} \\approx 0.909090... \\approx 0.9091$$\nThus, at pH 5.2, approximately $90.91\\%$ of the Glu35 side chains are in the catalytically active, protonated form.\n\nFinally, we must explain the consistency of this result with the observed pH optimum of HEWL, which is approximately pH 5.2. The catalytic mechanism of lysozyme, as proposed by Phillips, involves two critical carboxylate-containing residues: Glu35 and Asp52. For catalysis to occur:\n1. Glu35 must be protonated ($HA$ form) to act as a general acid, donating a proton to the glycosidic oxygen, which facilitates cleavage of the C-O bond.\n2. Asp52 must be deprotonated ($A^{-}$ form) to act as a nucleophile (or to stabilize the resulting oxocarbenium ion intermediate via electrostatic interaction).\n\nThe overall rate of catalysis is therefore proportional to the product of the probabilities that each residue is in its required ionization state:\n$$v \\propto \\alpha_{Glu35, HA} \\times \\alpha_{Asp52, A^{-}}$$\nOur calculation shows that at pH 5.2, the fraction of protonated Glu35 ($\\alpha_{Glu35, HA}$) is high ($0.9091$). The $\\text{p}K_a$ of an aspartic acid side chain in a typical aqueous environment is approximately $3.9$. At pH 5.2, which is significantly above its $\\text{p}K_a$, the Asp52 residue will be almost completely deprotonated. The fraction of deprotonated Asp52, $\\alpha_{Asp52, A^{-}}$, is given by $1 - \\alpha_{Asp52, HA} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\text{pH} - \\text{p}K_a}} = \\frac{10^{\\text{pH} - \\text{p}K_a}}{1 + 10^{\\text{pH} - \\text{p}K_a}}$. At pH 5.2, with $\\text{p}K_{a, Asp52} \\approx 3.9$, this fraction is very close to $1$.\n\nThe pH optimum of $5.2$ represents a compromise. If the pH were to decrease significantly, the fraction of protonated Glu35 would approach $1$, but the fraction of deprotonated Asp52 would decrease, inactivating the enzyme. If the pH were to increase significantly, Asp52 would remain deprotonated, but Glu35 would lose its proton ($\\alpha_{Glu35, HA}$ would decrease sharply as pH exceeds its $\\text{p}K_a$ of $6.2$), ceasing its function as a general acid. The fact that the enzyme's pH optimum is near pH 5.2, a value at which a very large fraction ($> 90\\%$) of the general acid catalyst (Glu35) is in its required active state, is fully consistent with the established catalytic mechanism. The optimum is located in a region where the concentration of the catalytically competent species (protonated Glu35 and deprotonated Asp52) is maximized.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9091}$$", "id": "2601185"}, {"introduction": "While analyzing a single residue is insightful, enzyme catalysis is often a concerted effort.

The use of solvent isotope effects (SIEs) is a standard and powerful tool in physical organic chemistry and enzymology for probing reaction mechanisms, particularly the involvement of proton transfers in transition states. The described mechanism of lysozyme, involving Glu$35$ and Asp$52$, and the two-step process of glycosylation/deglycosylation, is canonical textbook material. The experimental strategy of using substrates with different leaving group abilities to shift the rate-determining step is a classic approach in mechanistic enzymology. The data presented are realistic for such an experiment. The problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posedness and Objectivity**: The problem provides a clear conceptual framework and sufficient quantitative data to arrive at a logical conclusion. The terms are defined precisely (e.g., what $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ report on). The question is specific and answerable based on the provided information. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n*   **Other Flaws**: The problem is not metaphorical, trivial, contradictory, or incomplete. It addresses a core concept in biochemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived from the given information.\n\n**Derivation and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe catalytic cycle of lysozyme can be represented by the following scheme:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_2 \\text{ (glycosylation)}} E\\text{-}S' + P_1 \\xrightarrow{k_3 \\text{ (deglycosylation)}} E + P_2 $$\nHere, $E\\text{-}S'$ is the covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, $P_1$ is the leaving group portion of the substrate, and $P_2$ is the sugar released after hydrolysis. The overall kinetic parameters are given by:\n$$ k_{\\text{cat}} = \\frac{k_2 k_3}{k_2 + k_3} $$\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M} = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2} $$\nThe parameter $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ reports on the free energy barrier from $E+S$ to the first irreversible transition state, which is the TS for the glycosylation step ($k_2$). $k_{\\text{cat}}$ reports on the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle once the substrate is bound.\n\n**Analysis of Regime A: Good Leaving Group**\n\n*   **Conditions**: Glycosylation is fast, deglycosylation is the RDS. This means $k_2 \\gg k_3$.\n*   **Analysis of $k_{\\text{cat}}$**: Since $k_3$ is the slow step, the expression for $k_{\\text{cat}}$ simplifies to $k_{\\text{cat}} \\approx k_3$. The measured SIE is $k_{\\text{cat}}^{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}/k_{\\text{cat}}^{\\text{D}_2\\text{O}} \\approx 3.0$. This large, normal SIE indicates that a proton transfer from a solvent-exchangeable site is involved in the transition state for the rate-determining step. As $k_{\\text{cat}}$ reflects deglycosylation ($k_3$), this means the activation of a water molecule by the general base Glu$35$ occurs in the TS for hydrolysis of the $E\\text{-}S'$ intermediate.\n*   **Analysis of $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$**: This parameter reports on the glycosylation step ($k_2$). The measured SIE is $\\left(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M\\right)^{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}/\\left(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M\\right)^{\\text{D}_2\\text{O}} \\approx 1.0$. A unity SIE indicates that there is no proton in flight in the transition state of the step being probed. Therefore, in the glycosylation step with a good leaving group, the transition state for C–O bond scission does not involve significant, rate-contributing proton transfer from the general acid Glu$35$. This implies a dissociative mechanism where C–O bond cleavage precedes proton donation, likely forming an oxocarbenium-ion-like transition state stabilized by Asp$52$.\n\n**Analysis of Regime B: Poor Leaving Group**\n\n*   **Conditions**: Glycosylation is the RDS, deglycosylation is fast. This means $k_3 \\gg k_2$.\n*   **Analysis of $k_{\\text{cat}}$**: Since $k_2$ is the slow step, the expression for $k_{\\text{cat}}$ simplifies to $k_{\\text{cat}} \\approx k_2$. The measured SIE is $k_{\\text{cat}}^{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}/k_{\\text{cat}}^{\\text{D}_2\\text{O}} \\approx 2.5$. This large, normal SIE demonstrates that proton transfer is involved in the transition state of the rate-determining step, which is glycosylation.\n*   **Analysis of $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$**: This parameter also reports on the glycosylation step ($k_2$). The measured SIE is $\\left(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M\\right)^{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}/\\left(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M\\right)^{\\text{D}_2\\text{O}} \\approx 2.6$. The fact that this SIE is large and nearly identical to the SIE on $k_{\\text{cat}}$ provides strong confirmation that glycosylation is indeed the fully rate-limiting step and that its transition state involves proton transfer. This indicates that for a poor leaving group, proton donation from Glu$35$ is concerted with (i.e., coincident with) the cleavage of the C–O glycosidic bond to assist the departure of the leaving group.\n\n**Conclusion from Analysis**\nThe timing of proton transfer relative to bond cleavage is substrate-dependent.\n*   For a good leaving group (Regime A), glycosylation proceeds through a dissociative, oxocarbenium-ion-like TS where bond cleavage precedes proton transfer. Deglycosylation involves proton transfer in its TS.\n*   For a poor leaving group (Regime B), glycosylation proceeds through a concerted TS where proton donation and C–O bond cleavage are synchronous.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. In Regime A, the large SIE on $k_{\\text{cat}}$ but unity on $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ shows that proton transfer occurs in the RDS of deglycosylation (water activation by the general base), after glycosidic bond cleavage; in Regime B, large SIEs on both parameters show that proton donation by the general acid is coincident with C–O bond cleavage in the glycosylation TS.**\n    This statement accurately summarizes the conclusions derived from the data. The Regime A interpretation correctly identifies the large SIE on $k_{\\text{cat}}$ with the deglycosylation step and correctly interprets the unity SIE on $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ (which probes glycosylation). The phrase \"after glycosidic bond cleavage\" correctly places the deglycosylation step as occurring subsequent to the glycosylation step in the overall reaction sequence. The Regime B interpretation correctly identifies that the large SIEs on both parameters indicate a concerted mechanism where proton transfer is coincident with C–O bond cleavage in the glycosylation TS. This option is fully consistent with our analysis. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. In Regime A, the pattern indicates that proton transfer precedes glycosidic bond cleavage as a rapid pre-equilibrium in glycosylation; in Regime B, the absence of differential sensitivity implies that neither step involves proton transfers in their TSs.**\n    The first part is incorrect; a rapid pre-equilibrium proton transfer would typically produce a small equilibrium isotope effect, often inverse ($k_H/k_D < 1$), not unity ($\\approx 1.0$). The second part is factually false; Regime B shows large SIEs ($\\approx 2.5$), indicating significant proton transfer, not its absence. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. In Regime A, both steps share a common, slow pre-equilibrium proton transfer before any bond reorganization; in Regime B, the observed SIEs arise solely from equilibrium isotope effects on enzyme protonation that do not report on bond cleavage.**\n    The first part is nonsensical; it does not explain the differential SIEs on $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$. A single \"slow pre-equilibrium\" cannot account for two different observations. The second part is a poor explanation; it fails to account for why the SIE on $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ is $1.0$ in Regime A but $2.6$ in Regime B. An equilibrium effect on the free enzyme would not manifest so differently and would not be so large. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. In Regime A, an inverse SIE on $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ would be expected if deglycosylation were RDS; in Regime B, a normal SIE on $k_{\\text{cat}}$ alone implies diffusion control rather than chemical proton transfer.**\n    The first part is flawed. $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ reports on glycosylation, regardless of whether deglycosylation is the RDS for the overall cycle. The SIE on $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ reports on the TS of glycosylation. The condition of the subsequent step is irrelevant. The second part is a direct contradiction of fundamental principles. A large normal SIE is the definitive signature of a rate-limiting chemical step involving proton transfer, which is the antithesis of diffusion control (which would have an SIE near $1.0$). Furthermore, the SIE is not on \"$k_{\\text{cat}}$ alone\". **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2601249"}]}
