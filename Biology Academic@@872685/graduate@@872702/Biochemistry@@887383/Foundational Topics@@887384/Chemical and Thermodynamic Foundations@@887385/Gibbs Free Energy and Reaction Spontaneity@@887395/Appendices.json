This is consistent with the calculated ratios of rate constants. The data is fully self-consistent and adheres to fundamental laws of chemistry. The problem is well-posed and without flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full analysis will be performed.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe spontaneity and equilibrium position of a reaction at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ are governed by the Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta_r G$. The standard Gibbs free energy change under biochemical conditions ($pH\\ 7$), $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'}$, is related to the equilibrium constant $K'_{eq}$ by the equation:\n$$\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'} = -RT \\ln K'_{eq}$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant. A catalyst, by definition, does not alter the energies of the initial (substrate, $\\mathrm{S}$) and final (product, $\\mathrm{P}$) states of a reaction. Its function is to provide an alternative reaction pathway with a different transition state. Since $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'}$ is a state function—dependent only on the initial and final states—it must be independent of the reaction path. Therefore, a true catalyst cannot change $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'}$ and, consequently, cannot change the equilibrium constant $K'_{eq}$ or the equilibrium position of the reaction.\n\nThe rate of a reaction is governed by the activation free energy barrier, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$. According to transition state theory, the rate constant $k$ is related to this barrier by:\n$$k = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $h$ is the Planck constant. A catalyst accelerates a reaction by lowering the activation free energy barrier $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$. For a reversible reaction $\\mathrm{S} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{P}$, there is a forward barrier, $\\Delta G_f^\\ddagger$, and a reverse barrier, $\\Delta G_r^\\ddagger$. The standard Gibbs free energy of the reaction is the difference between these two barriers:\n$$\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'} = \\Delta G_f^\\ddagger - \\Delta G_r^\\ddagger$$\nBecause an enzyme does not change $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'}$, any change in $\\Delta G_f^\\ddagger$ must be accompanied by an equal change in $\\Delta G_r^\\ddagger$. That is, the enzyme must lower the activation barriers for both the forward and reverse reactions by the same amount of free energy. This ensures that the ratio of rate constants, $k_f/k_r$, remains equal to the unchanged equilibrium constant $K'_{eq}$.\n\n**Application to Provided Data**\n1.  **Effect on $\\Delta_r G$**: The problem states that the equilibrium composition is $[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\infty}=20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $[\\mathrm{P}]_{\\infty}=80\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ in both the presence and absence of enzyme $\\mathrm{E}$. This directly demonstrates that $K'_{eq}=4.0$ is unchanged. Since $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'} = -RT \\ln K'_{eq}$, the fact that $K'_{eq}$ is constant proves experimentally that the enzyme does not alter $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ'}$.\n\n2.  **Effect on $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$**: The enzyme increases the forward rate constant from $k_f^{\\mathrm{uncat}}=1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $k_f^{\\mathrm{cat}}=5.0\\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, a factor of $5 \\times 10^5$. It also increases the reverse rate constant from $k_r^{\\mathrm{uncat}}=2.5\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $k_r^{\\mathrm{cat}}=1.25\\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, also a factor of $5 \\times 10^5$. This massive increase in both rate constants indicates a significant lowering of both activation barriers, $\\Delta G_f^\\ddagger$ and $\\Delta G_r^\\ddagger$. The reduction in the barrier, $\\delta(\\Delta G^\\ddagger)$, can be calculated:\n$$\\delta(\\Delta G^\\ddagger) = -RT \\ln(\\text{rate enhancement factor})$$\n$$\\delta(\\Delta G^\\ddagger) = -(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\ln(5 \\times 10^5) \\approx -32.4\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\nBoth $\\Delta G_f^\\ddagger$ and $\\Delta G_r^\\ddagger$ are lowered by approximately $32.4\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, confirming the theoretical principles.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. A catalyst supplies an alternative microscopic pathway that lowers the transition-state free energy for both directions while leaving the free energies of the initial and final states unchanged; therefore $\\Delta_r G$ is path independent and unaffected by the enzyme, whereas $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ decreases markedly in both directions. Experimentally, identical equilibrium compositions with and without enzyme imply the same equilibrium constant and the same $\\Delta_r G$. Simultaneously, the large increases in both $k_f$ and $k_r$ with an unchanged ratio indicate that the barrier has been lowered without shifting equilibrium; activation free energies can be quantified from the rate constants to show the barrier reduction.**\n    This statement is a complete and accurate summary of the principles of catalysis. The mechanistic part is correct: catalysts lower $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ symmetrically for forward and reverse reactions without affecting the state functions of the endpoints, thus leaving $\\Delta_r G$ unchanged. The experimental plan correctly links the provided data to these principles: the constant equilibrium composition confirms the constant $\\Delta_r G$, and the large, proportional increases in $k_f$ and $k_r$ confirm the lowering of $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ without altering the equilibrium. This option aligns perfectly with both theory and the given data.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. An enzyme stabilizes the product relative to the substrate, thereby decreasing $\\Delta_r G$ and shifting equilibrium toward product while also lowering the forward barrier only. Experimentally, adding enzyme should increase the product mole fraction at equilibrium in proportion to enzyme concentration; the forward rate constant increases but the reverse rate constant is unchanged.**\n    This statement is fundamentally incorrect. If an enzyme stabilized the product relative to the substrate, it would change $\\Delta_r G$ and thus alter the equilibrium constant, which contradicts its role as a catalyst. The claim that only the forward barrier is lowered violates the principle of detailed balance and is factually contradicted by the data, which shows $k_r$ increases significantly. The experimental prediction that equilibrium composition changes is also directly refuted by the problem statement.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. To conserve thermodynamics, an enzyme must lower the forward barrier while raising the reverse barrier so that the equilibrium constant remains fixed. Detection would consist of a faster forward rate, a slower reverse rate, and the same equilibrium composition, implying that $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ changes with opposite sign in the two directions.**\n    This statement is nonsensical. Lowering the forward barrier (increasing $k_f$) while raising the reverse barrier (decreasing $k_r$) would drastically *increase* the equilibrium constant $K'_{eq} = k_f/k_r$. The premise that this \"conserves thermodynamics\" is false. The experimental prediction is internally contradictory: a change in the ratio $k_f/k_r$ cannot result in the \"same equilibrium composition.\" Furthermore, the data shows that both rates increase, not one increasing and one decreasing.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. An enzyme cannot alter $\\Delta_r G$ but can alter the barrier asymmetrically so that the ratio $k_f/k_r$ differs from the equilibrium constant while the macroscopic equilibrium composition remains the same; detection would consist of observing $k_f/k_r \\neq [\\mathrm{P}]_{\\infty}/[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\infty}$, demonstrating kinetic control in the presence of the enzyme.**\n    This statement proposes a violation of the principle of detailed balance (microscopic reversibility), a fundamental law of physics. At equilibrium, the relationship $K'_{eq} = k_f/k_r$ must hold. An enzyme cannot suspend this law. The idea of \"kinetic control\" relates to competing reaction pathways to different products, not a simple reversible equilibrium. The experimental test proposed ($k_f/k_r \\neq [\\mathrm{P}]_{\\infty}/[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\infty}$) is falsified by the provided data, where both sides of the expression equal $4.0$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that is consistent with both the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and kinetics and the experimental data provided in the problem is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2566414"}, {"introduction": "Many essential steps in biosynthesis are endergonic, meaning they require an energy input to proceed.

The smallest integer that satisfies this condition is $1$.\n\nThus, coupling the synthesis reaction to the hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule is sufficient to make the overall process spontaneous under standard transformed conditions. The net Gibbs energy change would be $\\Delta_{r} G^{\\circ\\prime}_{\\mathrm{total}} = 15 - 30.5 = -15.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, which is negative, confirming spontaneity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2566428"}]}
