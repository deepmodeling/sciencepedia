We will address each part in sequence with the required logical rigor. The problem as stated is scientifically sound and well-posed, and therefore warrants a complete solution.\n\nFirst, we address part one: the derivation of an expression for the temperature derivative of the natural logarithm of the apparent equilibrium constant, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln K'(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T}$.\n\nWe are given two starting points:\n$1$) The definition of the standard transformed Gibbs energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T)$, in terms of the apparent equilibrium constant, $K'(T)$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T) = -R\\,T\\,\\ln K'(T)\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n$2$) The fundamental thermodynamic relation for the differential of Gibbs free energy, $G$, at constant composition:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}G = -S\\,\\mathrm{d}T + V\\,\\mathrm{d}P\n$$\nwhere $S$ is entropy, $V$ is volume, and $P$ is pressure.\n\nOur objective is to find $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln K'(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T}$. We begin by isolating $\\ln K'(T)$ from the first given equation:\n$$\n\\ln K'(T) = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T)}{R\\,T}\n$$\nWe now differentiate this expression with respect to temperature $T$. The pressure $P$ is held constant as specified in the problem, so the temperature derivative is a total derivative. Applying the quotient rule for differentiation to the right-hand side yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln K'(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T} = -\\frac{1}{R} \\left[ \\frac{T \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T} \\right) - \\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}T}}{T^2} \\right] = -\\frac{1}{R} \\left[ \\frac{T \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T} - \\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T)}{T^2} \\right]\n$$\nTo proceed, we must evaluate the derivative $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T}$. From the second given relation, $\\mathrm{d}G = -S\\,\\mathrm{d}T + V\\,\\mathrm{d}P$, we can see that at constant pressure ($\\mathrm{d}P=0$), the partial derivative of Gibbs energy with respect to temperature is the negative of entropy:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = -S\n$$\nThis relation, known as a Maxwell relation or the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation precursor, applies to the change in Gibbs energy for a reaction as well. For the standard transformed state, we have:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\Delta G^{\\circ'}}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = -\\Delta S^{\\circ'}\n$$\nSince pressure is constant, this partial derivative is equivalent to the total derivative with respect to $T$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln K'(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln K'(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T} = -\\frac{1}{R T^2} \\left[ T (-\\Delta S^{\\circ'}(T)) - \\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T) \\right] = \\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T) + T \\Delta S^{\\circ'}(T)}{R T^2}\n$$\nFinally, we use the fundamental definition of the Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$. For the transformed biochemical standard state, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T) = \\Delta H^{\\circ'}(T) - T \\Delta S^{\\circ'}(T)\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives $\\Delta H^{\\circ'}(T) = \\Delta G^{\\circ'}(T) + T \\Delta S^{\\circ'}(T)$. We see that the numerator in our derived expression is precisely the standard transformed enthalpy change, $\\Delta H^{\\circ'}(T)$. Therefore, the final expression is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln K'(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T} = \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ'}(T)}{R T^2}\n$$\nThis is the van 't Hoff equation as it applies to transformed equilibrium constants.\n\nSecond, we state the assumptions under which this relationship is valid.\n$1$) The conditions defining the transformed standard state must be held strictly constant as temperature is varied. In this problem, this means that the $\\text{pH}$ (fixed at $7.00$), ionic strength $I$ (fixed at $0.25\\,\\text{M}$), and free magnesium ion activity $a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}$ (fixed at $1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$) do not change with temperature. This is a crucial and often experimentally challenging condition, as buffer $\\text{p}K_a$ values are themselves temperature-dependent.\n$2$) The quantity $\\Delta H^{\\circ'}$ represents the *standard transformed enthalpy of reaction*. It is not the same as the chemical standard enthalpy change. $\\Delta H^{\\circ'}$ is a weighted average that includes the enthalpy changes of all coupled protonation and ion-binding equilibria that occur as the system equilibrates to the fixed $\\text{pH}$ and fixed ion activities. The derivation assumes that this composite enthalpy term accurately reflects the total heat exchange under the specified constraints.\n$3$) The use of an apparent equilibrium constant $K'$, which is typically defined in terms of the total concentrations of reactant and product species, presupposes that the ratio of activity coefficients for the products and reactants is constant over the temperature range of interest. While holding ionic strength $I$ constant helps to stabilize activity coefficients, any residual temperature dependence is ignored.\n$4$) To integrate this equation, as required in the third part of the problem, one must know the temperature dependence of $\\Delta H^{\\circ'}(T)$. The assumption that $\\Delta H^{\\circ'}(T)$ is constant between $T_1$ and $T_2$ is equivalent to assuming that the standard transformed heat capacity change, $\\Delta C_p^{\\circ'} = (\\partial \\Delta H^{\\circ'} / \\partial T)_P$, is zero over that temperature interval. This is a common but not always accurate simplifying assumption.\n\nThird, we compute the value of $K'(T_2)$ at $T_2 = 310.15\\,\\text{K}$.\nWe start with the derived van 't Hoff equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\ln K' = \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ'}}{R T^2} \\mathrm{d}T\n$$\nGiven the assumption that $\\Delta H^{\\circ'}$ is constant over the temperature range from $T_1 = 298.15\\,\\text{K}$ to $T_2 = 310.15\\,\\text{K}$, we can integrate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\int_{K'(T_1)}^{K'(T_2)} \\mathrm{d}\\ln K' = \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ'}}{R T^2} \\mathrm{d}T\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(K'(T_2)) - \\ln(K'(T_1)) = \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ'}}{R} \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} T^{-2} \\mathrm{d}T\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{K'(T_2)}{K'(T_1)} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ'}}{R} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{T} \\right]_{T_1}^{T_2} = \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ'}}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\Delta H^{\\circ'} = -45.0\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = -45000\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$\n$R = 8.314462618\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$T_1 = 298.15\\,\\text{K}$\n$T_2 = 310.15\\,\\text{K}$\n$K'(T_1) = 1.30 \\times 10^{3}$\n\nPlugging these values into the integrated equation:\n$$\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{K'(T_2)}{1.30 \\times 10^{3}} \\right) = \\frac{-45000\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}}{8.314462618\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}} \\left( \\frac{1}{298.15\\,\\text{K}} - \\frac{1}{310.15\\,\\text{K}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{K'(T_2)}{1.30 \\times 10^{3}} \\right) \\approx -5412.4534 \\left( 0.003354020 - 0.003224246 \\right)\\,\\text{K}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{K}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{K'(T_2)}{1.30 \\times 10^{3}} \\right) \\approx -5412.4534 \\times 0.000129774 \\approx -0.702431\n$$\nTo find $K'(T_2)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{K'(T_2)}{1.30 \\times 10^{3}} = \\exp(-0.702431) \\approx 0.495372\n$$\n$$\nK'(T_2) = (1.30 \\times 10^{3}) \\times 0.495372 \\approx 643.984\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as requested gives $644.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{644.0}$$", "id": "2607148"}, {"introduction": "Metabolic pathways are intricate networks of interconnected reactions, and the thermodynamic data describing them must be internally consistent.

This is mathematically consistent, since the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction is the reciprocal of that for the forward reaction, $K_{\\text{rev}}^{\\prime} = 1/K_{\\text{fwd}}^{\\prime}$, which leads to:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{rev}}^{\\circ \\prime} = -RT \\ln(K_{\\text{rev}}^{\\prime}) = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{\\text{fwd}}^{\\prime}}\\right) = RT \\ln(K_{\\text{fwd}}^{\\prime}) = -(-RT \\ln(K_{\\text{fwd}}^{\\prime})) = -\\Delta G_{\\text{fwd}}^{\\circ \\prime} $$\nWe will now compute the oriented loop sum of standard transformed Gibbs energy changes, $\\sum \\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}$, for the three specified closed loops using the provided data: $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, and the given $K^{\\prime}$ values.\n\nFirst, the value of the product $RT$ is:\n$$ RT = (8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2478.92\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\nLoop $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$ consists of reactions $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$ all in the forward direction.
