A rigorous solution will be developed from first principles as required.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution must be derived from three fundamental principles: the acid dissociation equilibrium, the mass balance for the acid species, and the principle of electroneutrality for the final solution.\n\n1.  **Acid Dissociation Equilibrium**: The dissociation of the weak acid $HA$ in water is described by the equilibrium:\n    $$HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$$\n    The acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is defined as:\n    $$K_a = \\frac{[H^+][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$$\n    The problem states that the activity coefficients of $HA$ and $A^-$ are equal, justifying the use of concentrations instead of activities. Rearranging this expression gives the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid:\n    $$\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \\frac{K_a}{[H^+]}$$\n    We are given $pH = 7.20$ and $pK_a = 7.20$. By definition, $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^+])$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. Therefore, $[H^+] = 10^{-7.20}$ M and $K_a = 10^{-7.20}$. Substituting these into the ratio expression:\n    $$\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \\frac{10^{-7.20}}{10^{-7.20}} = 1$$\n    This demonstrates from first principles that for the target pH to be achieved, the concentrations of the weak acid and its conjugate base must be equal: $[A^{-}] = [HA]$.\n\n2.  **Mass Balance**: The total analytical concentration of the buffer components, $C_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of the undissociated acid and its conjugate base.\n    $$C_T = [HA] + [A^{-}]$$\n    Given $C_T = 50$ mM $= 0.050$ M. As per the validation, to meet the output precision requirement, we take this as $C_T = 0.05000$ M.\n    Substituting the result from the equilibrium analysis, $[HA] = [A^{-}]$, into the mass balance equation:\n    $$C_T = [A^{-}] + [A^{-}] = 2[A^{-}]$$\n    Solving for the required concentration of the conjugate base, $[A^{-}]$:\n    $$[A^{-}] = \\frac{C_T}{2} = \\frac{0.05000 \\text{ M}}{2} = 0.02500 \\text{ M}$$\n\n3.  **Electroneutrality and Stoichiometry**: The principle of electroneutrality requires that the total positive charge concentration in the solution equals the total negative charge concentration. The ions present in the solution are $Na^+$ (from $\\mathrm{NaOH}$), $H^+$ (from acid and water), $A^-$ (from acid dissociation), and $OH^-$ (from water). The charge balance equation is:\n    $$[Na^+] + [H^+] = [A^{-}] + [OH^-]$$\n    The problem permits neglecting the autoprotolysis of water. At $pH = 7.20$, we have $[H^+] = 10^{-7.20}$ M $\\approx 6.31 \\times 10^{-8}$ M and $[OH^-] = 10^{-(14.00 - 7.20)}$ M $= 10^{-6.80}$ M $\\approx 1.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Both of these concentrations are orders of magnitude smaller than the target buffer species concentration of $0.02500$ M. The approximation is therefore justified. The charge balance equation simplifies to:\n    $$[Na^+] \\approx [A^{-}]$$\n    The sodium ions in the final solution come exclusively from the volume of $\\mathrm{NaOH}$ solution added, $V_{NaOH}$. The total moles of $Na^+$ are $n_{Na^+} = C_{NaOH} \\times V_{NaOH}$. The concentration in the final volume $V_f$ is:\n    $$[Na^+] = \\frac{C_{NaOH} V_{NaOH}}{V_f}$$\n    Combining this with the simplified charge balance and the required concentration of $[A^{-}]$:\n    $$[A^{-}] = \\frac{C_{NaOH} V_{NaOH}}{V_f}$$\n    This equation links the required concentration of the conjugate base to the volume of strong base that must be added. We can now solve for $V_{NaOH}$:\n    $$V_{NaOH} = \\frac{[A^{-}] V_f}{C_{NaOH}}$$\n    Substituting the known values:\n    $$V_{NaOH} = \\frac{(0.02500 \\text{ M})(1.000 \\text{ L})}{0.1000 \\text{ M}}$$\n    $$V_{NaOH} = \\frac{0.02500}{0.1000} \\text{ L} = 0.2500 \\text{ L}$$\n    The problem asks for the answer in milliliters. To convert liters to milliliters, we multiply by $1000$:\n    $$V_{NaOH} = 0.2500 \\text{ L} \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{L}} = 250.0 \\text{ mL}$$\n    This result has four significant figures, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{250.0}$$", "id": "2611463"}, {"introduction": "A buffer's primary role is to resist changes in $pH$ upon the addition of an acid or base.

Substituting the expression for $\\alpha_0$:\n$$\n\\alpha_2 = \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}] + K_{a1}K_{a2}} \\right) = \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}] + K_{a1}K_{a2}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the approximate fraction $\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}}$.\n\nThe approximation treats the system as a simple monoprotic buffer involving only $\\mathrm{H_2A}$ and $\\mathrm{HA^-}$. This is equivalent to assuming that the second deprotonation does not occur, i.e., $[\\mathrm{A^{2-}}] \\approx 0$. Under this assumption, the total concentration of the acid is approximated as $C'_{\\mathrm{T}} = [\\mathrm{H_2A}] + [\\mathrm{HA^-}]$. The fraction of $\\mathrm{HA^-}$ within this two-species system, which we define as $\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}}$, is:\n$$\n\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HA^-}]}{[\\mathrm{H_2A}] + [\\mathrm{HA^-}]}\n$$\nUsing equation $(1)$ to express $[\\mathrm{H_2A}]$ as $[\\mathrm{H_2A}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{HA^-}]}{K_{a1}}$, we substitute into the denominator:\n$$\n\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HA^-}]}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{HA^-}]}{K_{a1}} + [\\mathrm{HA^-}]}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[\\mathrm{HA^-}]$ (which is non-zero unless $\\mathrm{pH}$ is extremely low) yields:\n$$\n\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_{a1}} + 1} = \\frac{K_{a1}}{[H^+] + K_{a1}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the approximate fraction.\n\nPart 3: Derivation and analysis of the relative error $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe relative error $\\varepsilon$ is defined as $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}} - \\alpha_1}{\\alpha_1} = \\frac{\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}}}{\\alpha_1} - 1$.\nWe compute the ratio $\\frac{\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}}}{\\alpha_1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}}}{\\alpha_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{a1}}{[H^+] + K_{a1}}\\right) \\div \\left(\\frac{K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}] + K_{a1}K_{a2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}}}{\\alpha_1} = \\frac{K_{a1}}{[H^+] + K_{a1}} \\times \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}] + K_{a1}K_{a2}}{K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}]}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}}}{\\alpha_1} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}] + K_{a1}K_{a2}}{([H^+] + K_{a1})[\\mathrm{H^+}]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}] + K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}]}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1^{\\mathrm{HH}}}{\\alpha_1} = \\frac{([\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}]) + K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}]} = 1 + \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}]}\n$$\nThe relative error $\\varepsilon$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\left(1 + \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}]}\\right) - 1 = \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}]}\n$$\nTo express $\\varepsilon$ in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$, $\\mathrm{p}K_{a1}$, and $\\mathrm{p}K_{a2}$, we substitute $[H^+] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$, $K_{a1} = 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}$, and $K_{a2} = 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_{a1}} 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}}{(10^{-\\mathrm{pH}})^2 + 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_{a1}} 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}} = \\frac{10^{-(\\mathrm{p}K_{a1}+\\mathrm{p}K_{a2})}}{10^{-2\\mathrm{pH}} + 10^{-(\\mathrm{p}K_{a1}+\\mathrm{pH})}}\n$$\nMultiply numerator and denominator by $10^{2\\mathrm{pH}}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{10^{2\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}}\n$$\nNow, we analyze the case where $\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}  2$. This implies $10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}  10^2 = 100$. In this regime, the denominator can be approximated as $1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}} \\approx 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}$.\nThe error becomes:\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\approx \\frac{10^{2\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}}{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}} = 10^{(2\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}) - (\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1})} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}\n$$\nThis simple form demonstrates that when $\\mathrm{pH}$ is significantly higher than $\\mathrm{p}K_{a1}$, the error becomes large. For example, if $\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}$, the relative error is approximately $\\varepsilon \\approx 10^0 = 1$, which corresponds to a $100\\%$ error. If $\\mathrm{pH}  \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}$, the error exceeds $100\\%$. This large error arises because the Henderson-Hasselbalch approximation for the first equilibrium improperly neglects the significant conversion of $\\mathrm{HA^-}$ to $\\mathrm{A^{2-}}$ (redistribution), which becomes the dominant process at $\\mathrm{pH}$ values near and above $\\mathrm{p}K_{a2}$.\n\nPart 4: Numerical evaluation of $\\varepsilon$.\n\nWe must evaluate $\\varepsilon$ for $\\mathrm{p}K_{a1}=6.3$, $\\mathrm{p}K_{a2}=9.5$, and $\\mathrm{pH}=11.0$. We shall use the exact derived expression for $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{10^{2\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the exponents:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} = 11.0 - 6.3 = 4.7\n$$\n$$\n2\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2} = 2(11.0) - 6.3 - 9.5 = 22.0 - 15.8 = 6.2\n$$\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{10^{6.2}}{1 + 10^{4.7}}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can rearrange the formula to avoid large numbers in the intermediate steps.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{10^{2\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}} = \\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}} \\cdot 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}}\n$$\nNo, that is incorrect. Let's use another equivalent form derived from $\\varepsilon = \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[H^+]^2 + K_{a1}[H^+]}$. Divide numerator and denominator by $[H^+]^2$:\n$\\varepsilon = \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}/[H^+]^2}{1 + K_{a1}/[H^+]} = \\frac{10^{2\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}}}$.\nThis is correct. An alternative form is obtained by dividing by $K_{a1}[H^+]$:\n$\\varepsilon = \\frac{K_{a2}/[H^+]}{[H^+]/K_{a1} + 1} = \\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}}{10^{-(\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1})} + 1} = \\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}}}{1 + 10^{-(\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1})}}$.\nThis formulation is better for calculation when $\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1}$ is large and positive.\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2} = 11.0 - 9.5 = 1.5\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a1} = 11.0 - 6.3 = 4.7\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{10^{1.5}}{1 + 10^{-4.7}}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical values:\n$$\n10^{1.5} = 10 \\sqrt{10} \\approx 31.6227766\n$$\n$$\n10^{-4.7} \\approx 0.0000199526\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{31.6227766}{1 + 0.0000199526} = \\frac{31.6227766}{1.0000199526} \\approx 31.6221458\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $31.62$.\nThe condition $\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a1} = 4.7  2$ is satisfied, so our approximation $\\varepsilon \\approx 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}} = 10^{1.5} \\approx 31.6228$ is indeed very close to the exact value, confirming the analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31.62}$$", "id": "2611450"}]}
