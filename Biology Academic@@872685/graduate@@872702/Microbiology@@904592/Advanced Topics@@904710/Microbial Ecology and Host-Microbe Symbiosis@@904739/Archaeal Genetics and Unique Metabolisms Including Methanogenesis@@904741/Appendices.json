The MCR enzyme, its F430 cofactor, the $\\text{Ni(I)}/\\text{Ni(II)}$ redox couple, and the process of methanogenesis are all well-documented subjects of scientific research. The use of LFT and the Nernst equation is standard practice. The provided numerical values are realistic for such a system.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and relationships to derive a unique, quantitative answer. The question is unambiguous. The consistency check, where $E^\\circ_{\\text{wt}} = E_{\\text{env}}$ correctly yields $50\\%$ of each redox state, confirms the internal consistency of the provided data.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjective or speculative claims. The effects of the mutation are stated as givens for the purpose of the calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution is derived in three parts: qualitative analysis, quantitative calculation, and evaluation of catalytic consequences.\n\n**1. Qualitative Analysis of the Mutation's Effect**\nThe problem describes a mutation that introduces a carboxylate group near the nickel center. This has two primary effects on the metal ion's electronic environment:\n- **Increased Ligand Field Strength:** The problem states the new carboxylate ligand increases the ligand field strength. The provided LFT principle states that an increased ligand field splitting energy preferentially stabilizes the higher oxidation state. In the $\\text{Ni(II)}/\\text{Ni(I)}$ couple, $\\text{Ni(II)}$ ($d^8$ configuration) is the higher oxidation state compared to $\\text{Ni(I)}$ ($d^9$ configuration). Therefore, LFT predicts that the $\\text{Ni(II)}$ state will be stabilized relative to the $\\text{Ni(I)}$ state.\n- **Electrostatic Interaction:** The carboxylate group carries a formal negative charge. This localized negative charge will have a more favorable electrostatic interaction with the more highly charged metal cation. Since $\\text{Ni(II)}$ has a $+2$ charge and $\\text{Ni(I)}$ has a $+1$ charge, the $\\text{Ni(II)}$ state is stabilized to a greater extent by the proximity of the negative charge.\n\nBoth effects work in the same direction: they lower the free energy of the $\\text{Ni(II)}$ state more than that of the $\\text{Ni(I)}$ state. This makes the reduction of $\\text{Ni(II)}$ to $\\text{Ni(I)}$ thermodynamically less favorable. Consequently, the standard reduction potential, $E^\\circ$, for the $\\text{Ni(II)} + e^- \\to \\text{Ni(I)}$ reaction must become more negative.\n\n**2. Quantitative Calculation of the Shift in $E^\\circ$**\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change for the reduction half-reaction is given by $\\Delta G^\\circ = G^\\circ(\\text{products}) - G^\\circ(\\text{reactants}) = G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)}) - G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})$.\nThe problem states that the mutation lowers the free energy of the $\\text{Ni(II)}$ state by $5.0\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$ and has a negligible effect on the $\\text{Ni(I)}$ state. Let's denote the wild-type and mutant states with subscripts 'wt' and 'mut'.\n$$G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})_{\\text{mut}} = G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})_{\\text{wt}} - 5.0\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$$\n$$G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)})_{\\text{mut}} \\approx G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)})_{\\text{wt}}$$\nThe change in the standard Gibbs free energy for the reaction due to the mutation is:\n$$\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ) = \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{wt}}$$\n$$\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ) = (G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)})_{\\text{mut}} - G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})_{\\text{mut}}) - (G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)})_{\\text{wt}} - G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})_{\\text{wt}})$$\n$$\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ) \\approx (G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)})_{\\text{wt}} - [G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})_{\\text{wt}} - 5.0\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}]) - (G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)})_{\\text{wt}} - G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})_{\\text{wt}})$$\n$$\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ) \\approx G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)})_{\\text{wt}} - G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})_{\\text{wt}} + 5.0\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} - G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(I)})_{\\text{wt}} + G^\\circ(\\text{Ni(II)})_{\\text{wt}}$$\n$$\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ) = +5.0\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$$\nThe relationship between the change in Gibbs free energy and the change in standard potential is $\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ) = -nF\\Delta E^\\circ$. The shift in the standard reduction potential, $\\Delta E^\\circ = E^\\circ_{\\text{mut}} - E^\\circ_{\\text{wt}}$, is therefore:\n$$\\Delta E^\\circ = -\\frac{\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ)}{nF} = -\\frac{+5.0\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}}{(1) \\cdot (96.485\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1})}$$\n$$\\Delta E^\\circ \\approx -0.0518\\,\\text{V}$$\nThus, the mutation makes the standard reduction potential more negative by approximately $0.05\\,\\text{V}$. The new standard potential is $E^\\circ_{\\text{mut}} \\approx -0.60\\,\\text{V} - 0.05\\,\\text{V} = -0.65\\,\\text{V}$.\n\n**3. Consequence for Catalysis**\nThe catalytically competent state is specified as $\\text{Ni(I)}$. The rate of methane production will depend on the concentration (or population) of this active state. We must determine the effect of the potential shift on the equilibrium between $\\text{Ni(I)}$ and $\\text{Ni(II)}$ at the fixed ambient potential $E_{\\text{env}} = -0.60\\,\\text{V}$.\nWe use the Nernst equation for the mutant:\n$$E_{\\text{env}} = E^\\circ_{\\text{mut}} + \\frac{RT}{nF}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Ni(II)}]}{[\\text{Ni(I)}]}\\right)$$\n$$-0.60\\,\\text{V} = -0.65\\,\\text{V} + \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Ni(II)}]}{[\\text{Ni(I)}]}\\right)$$\n$$0.05\\,\\text{V} = \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Ni(II)}]}{[\\text{Ni(I)}]}\\right)$$\nUsing the provided constants, $\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{2.478\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}}{96.485\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.0257\\,\\text{V}$.\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Ni(II)}]}{[\\text{Ni(I)}]}\\right) = \\frac{0.05\\,\\text{V}}{0.0257\\,\\text{V}} \\approx 1.95$$\n$$\\frac{[\\text{Ni(II)}]}{[\\text{Ni(I)}]} = e^{1.95} \\approx 7.0$$\nIn the wild-type enzyme, with $E_{\\text{env}} = E^\\circ_{\\text{wt}} = -0.60\\,\\text{V}$, the ratio $\\frac{[\\text{Ni(II)}]}{[\\text{Ni(I)}]} = 1$. The population of active $\\text{Ni(I)}$ was $50\\%$.\nIn the mutant enzyme, the ratio is approximately $7:1$. The fraction of active $\\text{Ni(I)}$ is now $\\frac{1}{1+7} = \\frac{1}{8} = 12.5\\%$.\nThe mutation significantly decreases the population of the catalytically active $\\text{Ni(I)}$ state. Consequently, the rate of methane production will be substantially reduced.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The mutation makes $E^\\circ$ for $\\text{Ni(II)} + e^- \\to \\text{Ni(I)}$ more positive by approximately $+0.05\\,\\text{V}$ by stabilizing Ni($\\text{I}$), thereby increasing the Ni($\\text{I}$) population and accelerating methane production.**\nThis statement is incorrect on all points. The potential shift is in the wrong direction (it becomes more negative, not more positive). The mutation stabilizes $\\text{Ni(II)}$, not $\\text{Ni(I)}$. This leads to a decrease, not an increase, in the $\\text{Ni(I)}$ population and thus slows, not accelerates, catalysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The mutation makes $E^\\circ$ for $\\text{Ni(II)} + e^- \\to \\text{Ni(I)}$ more negative by approximately $-0.05\\,\\text{V}$ by stabilizing Ni($\\text{II}$) through increased ligand field strength and a local negative charge, thereby decreasing the Ni($\\text{I}$) population and slowing methane production.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivation. The calculated potential shift is approximately $-0.05\\,\\text{V}$. The reasoning, stabilization of $\\text{Ni(II)}$ via LFT and electrostatics, is correct. The consequence, a decrease in the active $\\text{Ni(I)}$ population leading to slower catalysis, is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The mutation has negligible effect on $E^\\circ$ because the macrocyclic F430 field dominates the metal electronics; the Ni($\\text{I}$) population and catalysis remain unchanged.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem explicitly provides a non-negligible stabilization energy of $-5.0\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$, which must be used for the calculation. Our calculation shows this energy corresponds to a significant potential shift of approximately $-50\\,\\text{mV}$, which in turn dramatically alters the populations of the redox states.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The mutation makes $E^\\circ$ more negative by about $-0.05\\,\\text{V}$, but it increases the rate because Ni($\\text{II}$) is the reactive state that binds methyl-coenzyme M for methane formation.**\nThe first part of this statement, regarding the shift in $E^\\circ$, is correct. However, the second part is factually incorrect according to the problem statement itself, which explicitly defines the $\\text{Ni(I)}$ state as \"the catalytically competent state\". Therefore, the conclusion that the rate increases is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2474290"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the single-enzyme level to a population of cells, a key task in microbiology is to quantify metabolic activity.
