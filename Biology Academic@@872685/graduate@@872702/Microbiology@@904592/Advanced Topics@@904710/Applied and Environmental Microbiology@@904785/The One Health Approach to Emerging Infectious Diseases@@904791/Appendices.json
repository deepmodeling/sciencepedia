Do not include any intermediate steps in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in probabilistic modeling applied to quantitative microbial risk assessment. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary components for a rigorous derivation are provided. We proceed to solve it.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the one-time spillover probability, which we denote as $P_{\\text{spillover}}$. This is the probability that at least one infection occurs over the observation horizon of length $T$. It is computationally more direct to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, that is, the probability of zero infections occurring over the interval, which we denote $P_{\\text{no infection}}$. The spillover probability is then given by:\n$$ P_{\\text{spillover}} = 1 - P_{\\text{no infection}} $$\nThe probability of no infection must be calculated by averaging over all sources of randomness in the system: the number of contacts $N$, the host susceptibility factor $\\Theta$, and the sequences of exposure doses $\\{D_i\\}$ and viability factors $\\{V_i\\}$. We use the law of total expectation, conditioning sequentially on these random variables.\n\nLet us first determine the probability of no infection for a single contact event, conditional on a realized host susceptibility $\\Theta = \\theta$. The effective viable dose for a contact is the product $x = D V$, where $D$ is the exposure dose and $V$ is the viability factor for that contact. The probability of infection, conditional on an effective dose $x$ and susceptibility $\\theta$, is given by the exponential dose-response model: $1 - \\exp(-k \\theta x)$.\nConsequently, the probability of *no infection* for a single contact, given an effective viable dose $x$ and susceptibility $\\theta$, is $\\exp(-k \\theta x)$.\n\nTo find the probability of no infection for a single contact conditional only on $\\Theta = \\theta$, we must average over the random variables $D$ and $V$. Since $D$ and $V$ are independent, we can write this expectation as:\n$$ p_{\\text{no-inf}}(\\theta) \\equiv P(\\text{no infection at one contact} \\mid \\Theta=\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{D,V}[\\exp(-k \\theta D V)] $$\nWe can evaluate this using iterated expectations, first over $D$ and then over $V$:\n$$ p_{\\text{no-inf}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_V \\left[ \\mathbb{E}_D[\\exp(-k \\theta V D) \\mid V] \\right] $$\nThe inner expectation, $\\mathbb{E}_D[\\exp(-(k \\theta V)D)]$, is the definition of the Laplace transform of the dose distribution $f_D(d)$, which is $L_D(s) \\equiv \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-sD)]$, evaluated at the point $s = k \\theta V$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}_D[\\exp(-(k \\theta V)D) \\mid V] = L_D(k \\theta V) $$\nSubstituting this back, the single-contact probability of no infection conditional on $\\theta$ becomes an expectation over the viability factor $V$:\n$$ p_{\\text{no-inf}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_V[L_D(k \\theta V)] $$\nNow, we consider the total number of contacts $N$ over the interval of length $T$, which follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = \\lambda T$. Let us find the probability of no infections over all $N$ contacts, still conditional on $\\Theta = \\theta$. Assuming $N=n$ contacts, and since the outcomes of contacts are independent conditional on $\\theta$ (as $\\{D_i, V_i\\}$ are i.i.d.), the probability of no infections in $n$ contacts is the product of the single-contact probabilities:\n$$ P(\\text{no infection} \\mid N=n, \\Theta=\\theta) = [p_{\\text{no-inf}}(\\theta)]^n = \\left(\\mathbb{E}_V[L_D(k \\theta V)]\\right)^n $$\nTo remove the conditioning on $N$, we average over its Poisson distribution:\n$$ P(\\text{no infection} \\mid \\Theta=\\theta) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P(\\text{no infection} \\mid N=n, \\Theta=\\theta) P(N=n) $$\n$$ P(\\text{no infection} \\mid \\Theta=\\theta) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\mathbb{E}_V[L_D(k \\theta V)]\\right)^n \\frac{\\mu^n e^{-\\mu}}{n!} $$\nThis sum is a known series. It is the probability generating function of a Poisson($\\mu$) random variable, $G_N(z) = \\mathbb{E}[z^N] = \\exp(\\mu(z-1))$, evaluated at $z = p_{\\text{no-inf}}(\\theta)$.\n$$ P(\\text{no infection} \\mid \\Theta=\\theta) = \\exp\\left(\\mu \\left(p_{\\text{no-inf}}(\\theta) - 1\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\mu \\left(\\mathbb{E}_V[L_D(k \\theta V)] - 1\\right)\\right) $$\nThis expression can be rewritten as:\n$$ P(\\text{no infection} \\mid \\Theta=\\theta) = \\exp\\left(-\\mu \\left(1 - \\mathbb{E}_V[L_D(k \\theta V)]\\right)\\right) $$\nFinally, to obtain the total, unconditional probability of no infection, we must average this result over the distribution of the host susceptibility factor $\\Theta$:\n$$ P_{\\text{no infection}} = \\mathbb{E}_{\\Theta}[P(\\text{no infection} \\mid \\Theta)] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\Theta}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\mu\\left(1 - \\mathbb{E}_V[L_D(k \\Theta V)]\\right)\\right)\\right] $$\nThe desired one-time spillover probability is $1$ minus this expression. This provides the final analytical result in terms of the specified parameters and expectations.\n$$ P_{\\text{spillover}} = 1 - \\mathbb{E}_{\\Theta}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\mu\\left(1 - \\mathbb{E}_V[L_D(k \\Theta V)]\\right)\\right)\\right] $$\nThis expression correctly integrates the contributions from the frequency of contact ($\\mu$), host heterogeneity ($\\Theta$), pathogen infectivity ($k$), dose variability ($L_D$), and environmental persistence ($V$) to the overall risk of zoonotic spillover.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 - \\mathbb{E}_{\\Theta} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\mu\\left(1 - \\mathbb{E}_V[L_D(k \\Theta V)]\\right)\\right) \\right]} $$", "id": "2539131"}]}
