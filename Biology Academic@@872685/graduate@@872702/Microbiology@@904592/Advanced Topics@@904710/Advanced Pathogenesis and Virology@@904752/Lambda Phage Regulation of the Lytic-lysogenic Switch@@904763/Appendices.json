Comparison and Interpretation:**\nThe mutation causes a significant decrease in Cro occupancy at $O_{R}3$ (from $\\approx 83\\%$ to $50\\%$). The total probability of repression at $O_{R}3$ decreases (from $\\approx 92\\%$ to $75\\%$). Correspondingly, the probability that $P_{RM}$ is active (not repressed by $O_R3$) increases from $1/12$ to $1/4$. This constitutes a relief of repression on the $P_{RM}$ promoter.\n\nIncreased activity of $P_{RM}$ leads to increased transcription of the $cI$ gene, which codes for the CI repressor. An early increase in CI concentration biases the system toward lysogeny. A higher level of CI promotes its own synthesis by binding to $O_{R}1$ and $O_{R}2$ (activating $P_{RM}$) and simultaneously represses the lytic pathway by shutting down the $P_{R}$ promoter. The mutation thus shifts the balance in the competition between CI and Cro in favor of CI, making lysogeny a more probable outcome.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. It biases the decision toward lysogeny by reducing Cro occupancy at $O_R3$, thereby relieving repression of $P_{RM}$, increasing $cI$ transcription early, and promoting CI accumulation that further represses $P_R$ via $O_R1$ and $O_R2$.**\nThis statement presents a correct causal chain. Our derivation shows that Cro occupancy at $O_R3$ is reduced, which leads to a net relief of repression at $P_{RM}$. This relief boosts early $cI$ transcription. The resulting accumulation of CI protein is the key event for establishing lysogeny, which involves repression of $P_R$ via CI binding at $O_{R}1$ and $O_{R}2$. The reasoning is entirely consistent with our analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. It biases the decision toward lysis because increased CI occupancy at $O_R3$ strengthens negative autoregulation of $P_{RM}$, lowering CI levels below the threshold needed to repress $P_R$.**\nThis option correctly notes that CI occupancy at $O_{R}3$ increases (from $1/12$ to $1/4$). However, it incorrectly concludes that this \"strengthens negative autoregulation.\" The overall effect on $P_{RM}$ is determined by the total probability of occupancy at $O_{R}3$, which our calculation showed has decreased. The net effect is relief of repression, not strengthening of it. The premise of the argument is flawed, leading to an incorrect conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. It has no appreciable effect on the decision because $O_R3$ is involved only in maintenance of the lysogenic state and not in the initial decision.**\nThis premise is factually incorrect within the context of the established lambda switch model. The binding of Cro to $O_{R}3$ to repress $P_{RM}$ is a critical step in a successful lytic takeover. Therefore, $O_{R}3$ is fundamentally involved in the initial lytic-lysogenic decision, not just the maintenance of a pre-existing state. The problem itself is framed around the \"early post-infection conditions\" and the \"initial decision,\" directly contradicting this option's claim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. It destroys bistability by making $P_{RM}$ constitutively active, yielding a monostable lysogenic state regardless of multiplicity of infection or other conditions.**\nThis option makes an extreme claim. The calculation shows that repression of $P_{RM}$ is relieved, not eliminated. In the mutant, there is still a $75\\%$ probability of repression at $O_{R}3$. Hence, $P_{RM}$ is not \"constitutively active.\" The mutation shifts the balance of the bistable switch, making the basin of attraction for the lysogenic state larger, but it does not necessarily \"destroy\" bistability entirely, and certainly not \"regardless of other conditions.\" The statement is an over-extrapolation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2503958"}]}
