It is therefore valid. The solution will be derived by a direct logical deduction from the \"foundational facts\" provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the total number of capsid protein subunits, which we will denote as $N_{total}$, for an icosahedral virus with a triangulation number $T$. We are then asked to compute this value for the specific case where $T=7$.\n\nThe foundational facts provide the complete logical framework for this derivation. Let us proceed step-by-step.\n\nFact 3 states: \"The total number of capsid protein subunits equals the number of occupied quasi-equivalent lattice positions.\" This establishes a direct equality. If we let $N_{positions}$ be the total number of quasi-equivalent lattice positions on the entire capsid surface, then:\n$$N_{total} = N_{positions}$$\nThus, the problem is reduced to calculating the total number of these lattice positions.\n\nFact 1 states: \"An icosahedral object has $60$ proper rotational symmetries, and the icosahedral asymmetric unit is the minimal surface region that tiles the entire surface under these $60$ rotations.\" This means the entire surface of the icosahedral capsid is perfectly constructed from exactly $60$ copies of a single, fundamental region called the asymmetric unit. If we know the number of lattice positions within one asymmetric unit, the total number of positions on the entire surface will be $60$ times that value.\n\nFact 2 provides the final piece of information: \"In the Caspar–Klug construction, the triangulation number $T$ counts the number of quasi-equivalent lattice positions per icosahedral asymmetric unit...\" This directly defines $T$ as the quantity we need. The number of quasi-equivalent lattice positions per asymmetric unit is precisely $T$.\n\nCombining these facts, we can construct the general formula. The total number of lattice positions, $N_{positions}$, is the product of the number of asymmetric units that form the capsid and the number of lattice positions within each asymmetric unit.\n\nThe number of asymmetric units is $60$.\nThe number of lattice positions per asymmetric unit is $T$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positions is:\n$$N_{positions} = 60 \\times T$$\n\nFrom our first step, we know that $N_{total} = N_{positions}$. Substituting this, we arrive at the general expression for the total number of subunits as a function of the triangulation number $T$:\n$$N_{total}(T) = 60T$$\nThis is the general expression required by the problem statement.\n\nThe problem then requires the evaluation of this expression for a capsid with a triangulation number of $T=7$. We substitute this value into our derived formula:\n$$N_{total}(7) = 60 \\times 7$$\nThe calculation is elementary:\n$$N_{total}(7) = 420$$\n\nThus, a capsid with a triangulation number of $T=7$ is composed of $420$ protein subunits, under the stated assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{420}$$", "id": "2544627"}, {"introduction": "Viral assembly must be both efficient and accurate, a challenge that many viruses solve by using transient scaffolding proteins to guide the process. This exercise delves into the kinetic and thermodynamic principles that govern scaffold-mediated assembly, exploring how a virus can become trapped in a non-productive state [@problem_id:2544639]. By analyzing the role of regulated proteolysis, you will uncover the elegant molecular logic that allows a virus to use a strong interaction for assembly and then switch it off for maturation.", "problem": "A non-enveloped double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus uses an internal scaffold protein to nucleate and template assembly of a closed procapsid. The scaffold (denoted $S$) binds transiently at multiple, quasi-independent sites on the coat protein lattice (denoted $C$). After shell closure, a virally encoded protease is activated and cleaves $S$ into smaller fragments, after which the scaffold is released and the capsid undergoes maturation. Consider a point mutation in $S$ that leaves the diffusion-limited association rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ effectively unchanged but reduces the dissociation rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ by a factor of $100$ at temperature $T \\approx 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Assume standard relationships between binding kinetics, equilibrium constants, and free energies hold, and that within the assembled procapsid the effective scaffold concentration is sufficiently high that rebinding is possible once $S$ dissociates.\n\nUsing only first principles of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics for reversible binding, select the single option that most accurately explains, in one coherent chain of reasoning, both (i) how the reduced $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ can stall assembly/maturation by creating a kinetic trap and (ii) a thermodynamic rationale for why regulated scaffold cleavage is an advantageous design for the virus.\n\nA. The $100$-fold reduction in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ increases the mean residence time $\\tau$ of $S$ on $C$ by $100$-fold (since $\\tau \\approx 1/k_{\\mathrm{off}}$), promoting near-irreversible occupancy of scaffold sites and kinetically trapping the procapsid so that lattice rearrangements and expansion cannot proceed. Because $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is unchanged, detailed balance implies $K_D = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ shrinks commensurately, so rebinding is favored when $S$ is abundant inside the shell. Proteolytic cleavage after shell closure raises the standard free energy of binding of the resulting fragments (less interface, greater conformational entropy), increasing $K_D$ and thereby $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ via $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D$. To counteract a $100$-fold kinetic stabilization, cleavage must increase the binding free energy by roughly $\\Delta \\Delta G \\approx R T \\ln 100 \\approx 11$ to $12\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, which drives scaffold exit and releases the kinetic trap only when the shell is correctly assembled.\n\nB. The $100$-fold reduction in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ accelerates assembly by ensuring $S$ remains bound long enough to recruit more $C$, and proteolysis after closure further reduces the entropy of the bound state, tightening $S$–$C$ binding to stabilize the mature capsid against premature disassembly.\n\nC. If $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is diffusion-limited, the exact value of $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ does not materially affect assembly because binding is always near instantaneous; proteolysis is nevertheless required to supply the free energy from peptide bond hydrolysis to mechanically power shell expansion, which would otherwise be endergonic.\n\nD. Any decrease in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ can be compensated by increasing the concentration of $S$ during assembly to maintain dynamic turnover; regulated proteolysis then reduces the association constant $K_A$ after closure to keep detailed balance unchanged while still releasing $S$.\n\nE. Cleavage primarily lowers the activation barrier $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for dissociation without altering the binding free energy $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, so $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ increases but $K_D$ remains fixed; this avoids the need to change equilibrium thermodynamics even in the presence of high scaffold concentrations inside the procapsid.", "solution": "The problem asks for an explanation of how a substantial reduction in the dissociation rate constant ($k_{\\mathrm{off}}$) for a viral scaffold protein ($S$) can stall capsid assembly by creating a kinetic trap, and for a thermodynamic justification for the strategy of regulated proteolytic cleavage of this scaffold. The problem is to be analyzed using first principles of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics.\n\nFirst, let us establish the fundamental principles governing the reversible binding of the scaffold protein $S$ to the coat protein lattice $C$:\n$$S + C \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} S \\cdot C$$\n\nThe kinetics of this process are described by the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The thermodynamics are described by the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, which is related to the standard Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{bind}}$. These quantities are linked by the principle of detailed balance at equilibrium:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[S][C]}{[S \\cdot C]} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nAnd the relationship to free energy is:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -RT \\ln(K_A) = RT \\ln(K_D)$$\nwhere $K_A = 1/K_D$ is the association constant.\n\nThe problem states that a point mutation in $S$ reduces $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ by a factor of $100$ while leaving the diffusion-limited $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ unchanged.\n\nPart (i): The Kinetic Trap and Stalled Assembly\nThe mean residence time, $\\tau$, which is the average time a scaffold protein remains bound to the coat lattice, is the reciprocal of the dissociation rate constant:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$$\nA $100$-fold reduction in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ ($k'_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/100$) results in a $100$-fold increase in the residence time:\n$$\\tau' = \\frac{1}{k'_{\\mathrm{off}}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}/100} = 100 \\tau$$\nViral capsid assembly is a highly dynamic process that requires not only the association of components but also their dissociation to allow for error correction, annealing of the lattice into a lower energy state, and conformational changes required for maturation, such as shell expansion. By increasing the residence time so dramatically, the mutant scaffold binds to the coat lattice in a nearly irreversible manner on the timescale relevant for assembly. This locks the procapsid into a specific, potentially non-productive, conformation. The system becomes trapped in a long-lived intermediate state from which it cannot escape to proceed along the productive assembly pathway. This is precisely the definition of a kinetic trap. The inability of the scaffold to dissociate prevents the necessary structural rearrangements, thereby stalling the maturation process.\n\nPart (ii): Thermodynamic Rationale for Scaffold Cleavage\nThe assembly of the procapsid requires the scaffold to bind with sufficient affinity to overcome the entropic cost of organizing the coat proteins and to template their correct geometry. This implies a reasonably strong binding affinity (a small $K_D$ and negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{bind}}$). However, once the procapsid shell is complete, the scaffold must be removed to allow for DNA packaging and final maturation. The problem states that the scaffold concentration inside the closed shell is high, meaning that even if a scaffold molecule dissociates, it is likely to rebind if its affinity remains high.\n\nThis presents a paradox: the scaffold must bind strongly for assembly but weakly for removal. The virus resolves this through regulated proteolysis. A virally encoded protease is activated *after* shell closure and cleaves the scaffold protein $S$ into smaller fragments. This modification fundamentally alters the thermodynamics of the scaffold-capsid interaction. The binding of the fragments is much weaker than that of the intact scaffold for two main reasons:\n$1$. The binding interface is disrupted. A large protein often achieves high affinity through multiple, cooperative contact points (avidity). Cleavage separates these contact points, so each fragment binds with a much smaller interaction surface, resulting in a dramatic loss of binding energy.\n$2$. The entropy of the unbound state increases. A single large protein ($S$) becomes multiple smaller fragments ($\\sum S_{frag}$), which have greater translational and rotational entropy. This change favors the dissociated state.\n\nBoth effects lead to a significantly less negative (higher) standard free energy of binding, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, for the fragments compared to the intact protein. From $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{bind}} = RT \\ln K_D$, a large increase in $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{bind}}$ corresponds to a large increase in $K_D$.\nApplying the detailed balance equation, $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D$. Since $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is diffusion-limited and depends primarily on the size and charge of the molecules (which may not change drastically for a fragment versus the whole protein), the large increase in $K_D$ directly causes a large increase in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. This drastically shortens the residence time of the fragments on the capsid wall, ensuring that they spend most of their time in the unbound state and can be efficiently cleared from the procapsid.\n\nTo quantify the change, to overcome a $100$-fold stabilization (i.e., to increase $K_D$ by a factor of $100$), the change in free energy must be:\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{bind}} = RT \\ln(100)$$\nAt $T \\approx 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, with $R \\approx 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$:\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{bind}} \\approx (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(300\\,\\mathrm{K})(\\ln 100) \\approx (2494\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})(4.605) \\approx 11485\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} \\approx 11.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThis is a reasonable energetic cost for disrupting a protein-protein interface.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This option correctly states that a $100$-fold reduction in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ increases residence time $\\tau$ by $100$-fold, leading to a kinetic trap that stalls rearrangements. It correctly uses detailed balance ($K_D = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$) to show that $K_D$ decreases. It correctly identifies that cleavage weakens binding by raising the standard free energy of binding due to less interface and greater entropy. It correctly links the resulting increase in $K_D$ to an increase in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ via $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D$. Finally, it correctly calculates the required change in free energy ($\\approx 11-12\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) to counteract a $100$-fold stabilization. This explanation is complete, internally consistent, and correct from first principles.\n\nB. This option claims the reduction in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ *accelerates* assembly, which contradicts the premise that it can *stall* the process by creating a trap. It also incorrectly claims proteolysis *tightens* binding, whereas the biological requirement is to *weaken* binding to allow scaffold removal. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option incorrectly claims that the value of $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is immaterial if $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is diffusion-limited. This is a fundamental error; the residence time $\\tau = 1/k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is critical for the dynamics of any binding system. It also mischaracterizes the role of proteolysis as a power source for mechanical work, rather than a thermodynamic switch to alter binding affinity. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option incorrectly suggests that increasing the concentration of $S$ can compensate for a decrease in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. Increasing concentration would increase the occupancy of the bound state, making the kinetic trap worse, not better. Dynamic turnover depends on dissociation, which is governed by $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, an intrinsic property independent of concentration. The statement about \"keeping detailed balance unchanged\" is nonsensical, as detailed balance is a fundamental principle, not a variable to be controlled. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. This option incorrectly equates the effect of proteolysis with that of a catalyst, claiming it lowers the activation barrier for dissociation without altering the binding free energy ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$) or the equilibrium constant ($K_D$). Proteolysis is an irreversible covalent modification that changes the chemical nature of the scaffold, thereby fundamentally changing both $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$ and $K_D$. **Incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that provides a scientifically correct and comprehensive explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2544639"}, {"introduction": "Once assembled, viral complexes must traverse the dense and complex cytoplasm to reach sites of egress at the plasma membrane.
