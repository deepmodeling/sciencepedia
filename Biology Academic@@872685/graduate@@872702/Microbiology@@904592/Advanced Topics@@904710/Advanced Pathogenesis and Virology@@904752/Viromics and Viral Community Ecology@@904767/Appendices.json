We seek the equilibrium points and the conditions for their existence and stability.\n\n**1. Derivation of Equilibria**\n\nAn equilibrium point $(S^{\\ast}, V^{\\ast})$ is a state where the population densities do not change over time, meaning $\\dot{S} = 0$ and $\\dot{V} = 0$. The system of equations for the equilibria is:\n$$\nrS^{\\ast}\\left(1 - \\frac{S^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - \\phi S^{\\ast}V^{\\ast} = 0 \\label{eq:1}\\tag{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta\\phi S^{\\ast}V^{\\ast} - mV^{\\ast} = 0 \\label{eq:2}\\tag{2}\n$$\nWe can factor these equations to analyze the conditions:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} \\left[ r\\left(1 - \\frac{S^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - \\phi V^{\\ast} \\right] = 0 \\label{eq:3}\\tag{3}\n$$\n$$\nV^{\\ast} (\\beta\\phi S^{\\ast} - m) = 0 \\label{eq:4}\\tag{4}\n$$\nFrom equation $(\\ref{eq:4})$, we have two possibilities for an equilibrium: either $V^{\\ast} = 0$ or $\\beta\\phi S^{\\ast} - m = 0$.\n\n**Case 1: Virus-free equilibrium ($V^{\\ast} = 0$)**\nSubstituting $V^{\\ast}=0$ into equation $(\\ref{eq:3})$ yields:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} \\left[ r\\left(1 - \\frac{S^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nThis gives two possible solutions for $S^{\\ast}$: either $S^{\\ast}=0$ or $r(1 - S^{\\ast}/K) = 0$, which implies $S^{\\ast}=K$ (since $r>0$).\nThis case yields two biologically feasible equilibria:\n- The **trivial equilibrium**: $(S^{\\ast}, V^{\\ast}) = (0, 0)$. This represents the extinction of both populations.\n- The **virus-free equilibrium**: $(S^{\\ast}, V^{\\ast}) = (K, 0)$. This represents the host population at its carrying capacity in the absence of the virus.\n\n**Case 2: Coexistence equilibrium ($V^{\\ast} > 0$)**\nFor $V^{\\ast}$ to be nonzero, the second factor in equation $(\\ref{eq:4})$ must be zero:\n$$\n\\beta\\phi S^{\\ast} - m = 0\n$$\nSolving for $S^{\\ast}$, we obtain the host density at the coexistence equilibrium:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi}\n$$\nSince all parameters $m$, $\\beta$, and $\\phi$ are defined as positive, $S^{\\ast}$ is always positive. We can substitute this value of $S^{\\ast}$ into equation $(\\ref{eq:3})$. Since we assume coexistence, we must have $S^{\\ast} > 0$, so we can divide by $S^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nr\\left(1 - \\frac{S^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - \\phi V^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for the virus density $V^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\phi V^{\\ast} = r\\left(1 - \\frac{S^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV^{\\ast} = \\frac{r}{\\phi}\\left(1 - \\frac{S^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S^{\\ast} = m/(\\beta\\phi)$:\n$$\nV^{\\ast} = \\frac{r}{\\phi}\\left(1 - \\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi K}\\right)\n$$\nThus, the **coexistence equilibrium** is $(S^{\\ast}, V^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi}, \\frac{r}{\\phi}\\left(1 - \\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi K}\\right)\\right)$.\n\n**2. Existence Condition for the Coexistence Equilibrium**\n\nFor this coexistence equilibrium to be biologically feasible, both densities must be positive: $S^{\\ast} > 0$ and $V^{\\ast} > 0$.\n- The condition $S^{\\ast} = m/(\\beta\\phi) > 0$ is always met since $m, \\beta, \\phi > 0$.\n- The condition $V^{\\ast} > 0$ requires that:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{\\phi}\\left(1 - \\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi K}\\right) > 0\n$$\nSince $r > 0$ and $\\phi > 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi K} > 0\n$$\n$$\n1 > \\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi K}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta\\phi K > m\n$$\nThis inequality is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the coexistence equilibrium.\n\n**3. Justification via Linearization and Invasion Analysis**\n\nThe transition from viral extinction to coexistence is determined by the stability of the virus-free equilibrium $(K, 0)$. A virus population can establish itself in the host population (i.e., coexist) if and only if it can invade a stable, uninfected host population at its carrying capacity. This corresponds to the virus-free equilibrium $(K, 0)$ being unstable to the introduction of the virus.\n\nWe analyze the stability by linearizing the system around the equilibrium $(K, 0)$. The Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n$$\nJ(S, V) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{S}}{\\partial S} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{S}}{\\partial V} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{V}}{\\partial S} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{V}}{\\partial V} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r - \\frac{2rS}{K} - \\phi V & -\\phi S \\\\ \\beta\\phi V & \\beta\\phi S - m \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEvaluating this matrix at the virus-free equilibrium $(S^{\\ast}, V^{\\ast}) = (K, 0)$:\n$$\nJ(K, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - \\frac{2rK}{K} - \\phi(0) & -\\phi K \\\\ \\beta\\phi (0) & \\beta\\phi K - m \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -r & -\\phi K \\\\ 0 & \\beta\\phi K - m \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is an upper triangular matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = -r$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\beta\\phi K - m$.\nFor the equilibrium $(K, 0)$ to be stable, all eigenvalues must have negative real parts.\n- $\\lambda_1 = -r$ is always negative, since $r > 0$. This indicates that the host population is stable at its carrying capacity in the S-direction (in the absence of V).\n- The stability with respect to the introduction of viruses depends on the sign of $\\lambda_2$.\n\nIf $\\lambda_2 < 0$, i.e., $\\beta\\phi K - m < 0 \\iff \\beta\\phi K < m$, then both eigenvalues are negative. The equilibrium $(K, 0)$ is stable. Any small introduction of viruses will decay to zero. This is the **viral extinction** regime.\n\nIf $\\lambda_2 > 0$, i.e., $\\beta\\phi K - m > 0 \\iff \\beta\\phi K > m$, then one eigenvalue is positive. The equilibrium $(K, 0)$ is a saddle point and is unstable. A small introduction of viruses will lead to exponential growth of the virus population, causing the system to move away from the virus-free state. This is the condition for a successful viral invasion, which leads to the **coexistence** state.\n\nThis stability analysis confirms that the parameter regime for coexistence is precisely $\\beta\\phi K > m$, which is the same condition derived for the biological feasibility ($V^{\\ast} > 0$) of the coexistence equilibrium.\n\nThe problem asks for the symbolic expression for the coexistence host density $S^{\\ast}$. From our derivation in part 1:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi}\n$$\nThis expression gives the host density required to sustain a stable virus population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m}{\\beta\\phi}}$$", "id": "2545274"}, {"introduction": "Beyond direct interactions with hosts, a virus's success depends on its ability to survive in the environment as a free particle.

The $i$-th component of the transformed vector, $\\text{clr}(\\mathbf{z})$, is given by:\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{z})_i = \\ln\\left(\\frac{z_i}{g(\\mathbf{z})}\\right) = \\ln(z_i) - \\ln(g(\\mathbf{z})) $$\nwhere $g(\\mathbf{z})$ is the geometric mean of the components of $\\mathbf{z}$:\n$$ g(\\mathbf{z}) = \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{D} z_j \\right)^{1/D} $$\nThe term $\\ln(g(\\mathbf{z}))$ can be computed as the arithmetic mean of the log-transformed components:\n$$ \\ln(g(\\mathbf{z})) = \\frac{1}{D} \\sum_{j=1}^{D} \\ln(z_j) $$\n\nFirst, we compute the clr transformation for Sample A ($\\mathbf{x}$).\nThe log-transformed components are:\n$$ \\ln(x_1) = \\ln(1200) \\approx 7.090077 $$\n$$ \\ln(x_2) = \\ln(300) \\approx 5.703782 $$\n$$ \\ln(x_3) = \\ln(150) \\approx 5.010635 $$\n$$ \\ln(x_4) = \\ln(90) \\approx 4.499810 $$\n$$ \\ln(x_5) = \\ln(60) \\approx 4.094345 $$\nThe mean of these log-values is:\n$$ \\ln(g(\\mathbf{x})) = \\frac{1}{5} (7.090077 + 5.703782 + 5.010635 + 4.499810 + 4.094345) \\approx \\frac{26.398649}{5} \\approx 5.279730 $$\nThe clr-transformed vector $\\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x})$ is:\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x})_1 = 7.090077 - 5.279730 = 1.810347 $$\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x})_2 = 5.703782 - 5.279730 = 0.424052 $$\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x})_3 = 5.010635 - 5.279730 = -0.269095 $$\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x})_4 = 4.499810 - 5.279730 = -0.779920 $$\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x})_5 = 4.094345 - 5.279730 = -1.185385 $$\n\nNext, we compute the clr transformation for Sample B ($\\mathbf{y}$).\nThe log-transformed components are:\n$$ \\ln(y_1) = \\ln(800) \\approx 6.684612 $$\n$$ \\ln(y_2) = \\ln(600) \\approx 6.396930 $$\n$$ \\ln(y_3) = \\ln(100) \\approx 4.605170 $$\n$$ \\ln(y_4) = \\ln(80) \\approx 4.382027 $$\n$$ \\ln(y_5) = \\ln(20) \\approx 2.995732 $$\nThe mean of these log-values is:\n$$ \\ln(g(\\mathbf{y})) = \\frac{1}{5} (6.684612 + 6.396930 + 4.605170 + 4.382027 + 2.995732) \\approx \\frac{25.064471}{5} \\approx 5.012894 $$\nThe clr-transformed vector $\\text{clr}(\\mathbf{y})$ is:\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{y})_1 = 6.684612 - 5.012894 = 1.671718 $$\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{y})_2 = 6.396930 - 5.012894 = 1.384036 $$\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{y})_3 = 4.605170 - 5.012894 = -0.407724 $$\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{y})_4 = 4.382027 - 5.012894 = -0.630867 $$\n$$ \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{y})_5 = 2.995732 - 5.012894 = -2.017162 $$\n\nThe Aitchison distance, $d_A(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$, is the Euclidean distance between $\\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x})$ and $\\text{clr}(\\mathbf{y})$:\n$$ d_A(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^{D} (\\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x})_i - \\text{clr}(\\mathbf{y})_i)^2 } $$\nWe compute the squared differences for each component:\n$$ (1.810347 - 1.671718)^2 = (0.138629)^2 \\approx 0.019218 $$\n$$ (0.424052 - 1.384036)^2 = (-0.959984)^2 \\approx 0.921569 $$\n$$ (-0.269095 - (-0.407724))^2 = (0.138629)^2 \\approx 0.019218 $$\n$$ (-0.779920 - (-0.630867))^2 = (-0.149053)^2 \\approx 0.022217 $$\n$$ (-1.185385 - (-2.017162))^2 = (0.831777)^2 \\approx 0.691853 $$\nThe sum of these squared differences is:\n$$ d_A(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})^2 \\approx 0.019218 + 0.921569 + 0.019218 + 0.022217 + 0.691853 = 1.674075 $$\nThe Aitchison distance is the square root of this sum:\n$$ d_A(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\sqrt{1.674075} \\approx 1.2938599 $$\nThis distance is a single-value summary of the total dissimilarity between the relative abundance structures of the two viral communities. In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on clr-transformed data, this distance represents the separation of the two samples in the full Euclidean space, the variance of which is partitioned by the principal components. A larger distance indicates a greater overall difference in the log-ratios of component abundances, signifying more substantial compositional change between the samples.\n\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures provides the final answer.\n$$ 1.2938599 \\approx 1.294 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.294}$$", "id": "2545257"}]}
