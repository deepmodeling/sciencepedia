It is a standard exercise in biophysical chemistry and chemical reaction engineering, grounded in correct physical and mathematical principles. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Fraction of AHL remaining after a specified time**\n\nFor a first-order process, the concentration $C(t)$ of a substance at time $t$ is given by the rate law:\n$$C(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $C(0)$ is the initial concentration and $k$ is the first-order rate constant. The half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is the time required for the concentration to decrease to half of its initial value, $C(t_{1/2}) = C(0)/2$. Substituting this into the rate law gives:\n$$\\frac{C(0)}{2} = C(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}$$\nThus, the relationship between the rate constant and half-life for a first-order process is:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nThe fraction of AHL remaining, $f(t)$, is the ratio $C(t)/C(0)$:\n$$f(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{C(0)} = \\exp(-kt)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$:\n$$f(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}t\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-t/t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right) = 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}$$\nWe compute this fraction for each AHL at $t = 2.0$ hours.\n\nFor AHL-A, with $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{A}} = 0.80$ hours:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{A}}(2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}) = 2^{-2.0/0.80} = 2^{-2.5} \\approx 0.1768$$\nFor AHL-B, with $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{B}} = 5.0$ hours:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{B}}(2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}) = 2^{-2.0/5.0} = 2^{-0.4} \\approx 0.7579$$\nThese values indicate that AHL-A degrades significantly faster than AHL-B in a well-mixed environment.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the characteristic communication length $L$**\n\nWe must solve the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation for the concentration profile $c(x)$:\n$$D \\frac{d^{2}c}{dx^{2}} - kc = 0$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n$$Dr^2 - k = 0$$\nThe roots are $r = \\pm\\sqrt{k/D}$. The general solution is therefore:\n$$c(x) = A_{1} \\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right) + A_{2} \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right)$$\nwhere $A_1$ and $A_2$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions.\nThe first boundary condition is $c(0) = c_0$:\n$$c_0 = A_{1}\\exp(0) + A_{2}\\exp(0) = A_1 + A_2$$\nThe second boundary condition is that $c(x)$ must be bounded as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. To satisfy the boundary condition, its coefficient must be zero, so $A_1 = 0$.\nFrom the first condition, we then have $A_2 = c_0$. The specific solution for the concentration profile is:\n$$c(x) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right)$$\nThe characteristic communication length $L$ is defined as the distance $x$ at which the concentration has decayed to $c_0/\\exp(1)$. We set $x=L$ and $c(L) = c_0 \\exp(-1)$:\n$$c_0 \\exp(-1) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}L\\right)$$\nEquating the exponents:\n$$-1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}L$$\nSolving for $L$ gives the expression for the characteristic length:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k/D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}$$\nThis length scale represents the distance over which a signaling molecule can diffuse before it is effectively removed by reaction.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the ratio of characteristic lengths $L_{\\mathrm{A}}/L_{\\mathrm{B}}$**\n\nUsing the derived expression for $L$, the ratio $L_{\\mathrm{A}}/L_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{A}}}{L_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{A}}/k_{\\mathrm{A}}}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{B}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\cdot \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{D_{\\mathrm{B}}}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{A}}}{D_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right)}$$\nWe substitute the relationship $k = \\ln(2)/t_{1/2}$ into the ratio of the rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{k_{\\mathrm{A}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)/t_{1/2,\\mathrm{B}}}{\\ln(2)/t_{1/2,\\mathrm{A}}} = \\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{A}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{B}}}$$\nThe expression for the ratio of lengths becomes:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{A}}}{L_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{A}}}{D_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{A}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{B}}}\\right)}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$D_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-10}$ $\\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}$\n$D_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-10}$ $\\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}$\n$t_{1/2,\\mathrm{A}} = 0.80$ hours\n$t_{1/2,\\mathrm{B}} = 5.0$ hours\n\nThe units for $D$ and $t_{1/2}$ cancel in the ratios, so no conversion is necessary.\n$$\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{A}}}{D_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{-10}}{0.8 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{1.2}{0.8} = 1.5$$\n$$\\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{A}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{0.80}{5.0} = 0.16$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the ratio of lengths:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{A}}}{L_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\sqrt{1.5 \\times 0.16} = \\sqrt{0.24}$$\nCalculating the numerical value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{A}}}{L_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\approx 0.4898979... \\approx 0.4899$$\nThe ratio being less than $1$ indicates that the characteristic communication length for AHL-A is significantly shorter than for AHL-B. This is a direct consequence of the much faster hydrolysis of AHL-A (a shorter half-life), which outweighs its slightly faster diffusion. Therefore, in an alkaline biofilm, AHL-A acts as a short-range signal, while AHL-B is capable of mediating communication over longer distances.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4899}$$", "id": "2481839"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple decay, the chemical environment of the biofilm's extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) can actively modulate signal availability through binding and sequestration.

Our goal is to find an expression for the free autoinducer concentration, $[A]$, in terms of the total concentrations $A_T$ and $E_T$, and the dissociation constant $K_d$.

For an interior grid point $i$ (where $1 \\le i \\le N-2$), a second-order central difference stencil is used for the second derivative:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d^2 A}{dx^2}\\right|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{A_{i-1} - 2 A_i + A_{i+1}}{\\Delta x^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the governing equation yields a linear algebraic equation for each interior point:\n$$\nD \\frac{A_{i-1} - 2 A_i + A_{i+1}}{\\Delta x^2} - \\mu A_i + q s_i = 0.\n$$\nFor the boundary points $i=0$ and $i=N-1$, the zero-flux condition is enforced using the specified second-order accurate stencils, which arise from eliminating a \"ghost point\" outside the domain:\nFor $i=0$:\n$$\nD \\frac{2(A_1 - A_0)}{\\Delta x^2} - \\mu A_0 + q s_0 = 0.\n$$\nFor $i=N-1$:\n$$\nD \\frac{2(A_{N-2} - A_{N-1})}{\\Delta x^2} - \\mu A_{N-1} + q s_{N-1} = 0.\n$$\nThis set of $N$ linear equations can be expressed in matrix form, $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{A} = [A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{N-1}]^T$ is the vector of unknown concentrations, $\\mathbf{M}$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix of coefficients, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is an $N \\times 1$ source vector.\n\nBy rearranging the discretized equations, we can construct the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}$:\nThe general form of the $i$-th equation is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{D}{\\Delta x^2}\\right) A_{i-1} - \\left(\\frac{2D}{\\Delta x^2} + \\mu\\right) A_i + \\left(\\frac{D}{\\Delta x^2}\\right) A_{i+1} = -q s_i, \\quad \\text{for } 1 \\le i \\le N-2.\n$$\nThe boundary equations are:\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{2D}{\\Delta x^2} + \\mu\\right) A_0 + \\left(\\frac{2D}{\\Delta x^2}\\right) A_1 = -q s_0, \\quad \\text{for } i=0.\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2D}{\\Delta x^2}\\right) A_{N-2} - \\left(\\frac{2D}{\\Delta x^2} + \\mu\\right) A_{N-1} = -q s_{N-1}, \\quad \\text{for } i=N-1.\n$$\nFrom these expressions, the tridiagonal matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ has the following non-zero elements:\n- Main diagonal: $M_{i,i} = -(\\frac{2D}{\\Delta x^2} + \\mu)$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n- Upper diagonal: $M_{i,i+1} = \\frac{D}{\\Delta x^2}$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-2\\}$, with a special boundary term $M_{0,1} = \\frac{2D}{\\Delta x^2}$.\n- Lower diagonal: $M_{i,i-1} = \\frac{D}{\\Delta x^2}$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-2\\}$, with a special boundary term $M_{N-1,N-2} = \\frac{2D}{\\Delta x^2}$.\nThe source vector $\\mathbf{b}$ has elements $b_i = -q s_i$, where $s_i = 1$ if $|x_i| \\le \\frac{w}{2}$ and $s_i = 0$ otherwise. The system $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{b}$ is solved for the vector $\\mathbf{A}$ using a standard linear solver.\n\nOnce the steady-state concentration profile $\\mathbf{A}$ is obtained, we determine the response of the receiver strain. A receiver is \"on\" at position $x_i$ if two conditions are met simultaneously: $H_{\\text{on}}(A_i) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$ and $H_{\\text{off}}(A_i) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. The Hill function threshold condition with $\\tau = \\frac{1}{2}$ simplifies significantly. For an activating Hill function $H_{\\text{on}}(A) = \\frac{A^{n_{\\text{on}}}}{K_{\\text{on}}^{n_{\\text{on}}} + A^{n_{\\text{on}}}}$, the condition $H_{\\text{on}}(A) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$ is equivalent to $A \\ge K_{\\text{on}}$. Similarly, for a repressing Hill function used here in an \"off\" logic $H_{\\text{off}}(A) = \\frac{A^{n_{\\text{off}}}}{K_{\\text{off}}^{n_{\\text{off}}} + A^{n_{\\text{off}}}}$, the condition $H_{\\text{off}}(A) \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ is equivalent to $A \\le K_{\\text{off}}$. Thus, the receiver is \"on\" if and only if the concentration $A_i$ falls within the band-pass window $[K_{\\text{on}}, K_{\\text{off}}]$. The specific values of the Hill coefficients $n_{\\text{on}}$ and $n_{\\text{off}}$ do not influence the thresholds, only the steepness of the response.\n\nA \"stripe\" is defined as a contiguous region where the receiver is \"on\" *and* which is located outside the sender band, i.e., where $|x_i| > \\frac{w}{2}$. To count the number of stripes, we first construct a boolean mask for the grid points, which is true if $K_{\\text{on}} \\le A_i \\le K_{\\text{off}}$ and $|x_i| > \\frac{w}{2}$. Then, we count the number of disjoint, contiguous blocks of true values in this mask. This is algorithmically achieved by finding the number of times the mask transitions from false to true along the spatial axis. By padding the mask with an initial false value, this count can be robustly computed by summing the occurrences where the difference between consecutive elements is $1$.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each parameter set provided in the test suite to compute the final integer count of stripes.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 1D reaction-diffusion problem for biofilm stripe formation\n    for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test cases: (D, mu, L, w, q, K_on, K_off, n_on, n_off)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.2, 0.6, 2.0, 2.0),\n        (1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 2.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.6, 2.0, 2.0),\n        (1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.2, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0),\n        (0.5, 1.0, 10.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.2, 0.6, 2.0, 2.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Numerical parameters specified in the problem\n    N = 2001\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        D, mu, L, w, q, K_on, K_off, n_on, n_off = case\n\n        # 1.
