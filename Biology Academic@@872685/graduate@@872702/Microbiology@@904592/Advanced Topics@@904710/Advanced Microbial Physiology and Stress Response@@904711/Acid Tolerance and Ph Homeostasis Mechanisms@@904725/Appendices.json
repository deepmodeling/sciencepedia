The problem gives the added strong acid equivalents as $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, so we identify $\\Delta C_A = \\Delta C_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$. The change in pH is defined as the final pH, $\\mathrm{pH}_{i,f}$, minus the initial pH, $\\mathrm{pH}_{i,0}$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_i = \\mathrm{pH}_{i,f} - \\mathrm{pH}_{i,0}\n$$\nThe first task is to derive the relation connecting the acid addition to the pH change. By rearranging the approximate equation for buffer capacity, we obtain this relation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_i \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{\\beta}\n$$\nThis is the required relationship. It demonstrates that the change in pH is directly and negatively proportional to the concentration of added acid and inversely proportional to the buffer capacity of the medium.\n\nThe second task is to compute the new intracellular pH.

The problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed, permitting a solution from first principles.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental principles of passive transport across a biological membrane and weak acid dissociation equilibria.\n\nThe rate-limiting step is stated to be passive entry of the neutral acid species, $\\mathrm{HA}$, across the phospholipid bilayer. According to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux $J$ (amount of substance per unit area per unit time) of the species $\\mathrm{HA}$ across the membrane is proportional to the concentration gradient. Given the assumption that intracellular deprotonation is rapid and irreversible, the internal concentration of the neutral form $[\\mathrm{HA}]_{\\text{in}}$ is effectively zero. The flux is therefore driven by the external concentration of the neutral species, $[\\mathrm{HA}]_{\\text{ext}}$.\n\nThe flux $J$ can be expressed as:\n$$ J = P_{\\text{mem}} [\\mathrm{HA}]_{\\text{ext}} $$\nwhere $P_{\\text{mem}}$ is the membrane permeability coefficient for the neutral acid.

Substituting this into the equation for $C_T$:\n$$ C_T = [\\mathrm{HA}] + K_a \\frac{[\\mathrm{HA}]}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]} = [\\mathrm{HA}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_a}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]} \\right) $$\nSolving for $[\\mathrm{HA}]$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{HA}] = \\frac{C_T}{1 + \\frac{K_a}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}} $$\nUsing the definitions $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$, the ratio $\\frac{K_a}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}$ can be expressed as $10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}$.
