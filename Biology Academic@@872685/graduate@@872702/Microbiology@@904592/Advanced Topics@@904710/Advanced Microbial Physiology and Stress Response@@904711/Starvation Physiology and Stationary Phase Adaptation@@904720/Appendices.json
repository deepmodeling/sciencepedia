By analyzing hypothetical time-series data, you will quantify the fundamental rates of death and lysis, gaining a deeper appreciation for the population dynamics at play in a non-growing culture.", "problem": "A glucose-exhausted batch culture of a Gram-negative bacterium is shifted to a carbon-free buffer and maintained under strictly aerobic conditions at constant temperature. The culture immediately enters stationary phase. Over the next $24$ hours, the measured Optical Density at $600$ nm ($OD_{600}$) remains constant at $0.800$ for all recorded time points, while Colony-Forming Units (CFU) decline. You will model starvation physiology using a two-compartment framework in which $OD_{600}$ tracks total intact cellular biomass (viable plus dead-intact), whereas CFU tracks only viable cells.\n\nAssumptions and model specification:\n- Viable cells form CFU and have abundance $N(t)$ (CFU per mL). Dead-intact cells have abundance $Z(t)$ (intact but non-viable carcasses per mL).\n- There is no cell division and no net de novo biomass synthesis under starvation. Death converts viable cells to dead-intact at a first-order per-capita rate $k_d$ (units $\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$). Dead-intact cells lyse (lose optical visibility) at a first-order per-capita rate $k_l$ (units $\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n- $OD_{600}$ is proportional to the total number of intact scattering particles $X(t) \\propto N(t)+Z(t)$; lysed material does not contribute to OD.

The use of a two-compartment model (viable, dead-intact) with first-order kinetics for death and lysis is a common approach in quantitative microbiology. The data for CFU decline are internally consistent with the proposed first-order decay model. The key assumption is that the Optical Density, $OD$, is exactly constant. While this is an idealization, the problem explicitly instructs to treat it as such to deduce a parameter of the model. This makes it a well-posed problem in mathematical modeling, designed to test the logical consequences of a given assumption within a defined framework. The problem is self-contained, objective, and does not violate any fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for the determination of the death rate, $k_d$, and the lysis rate, $k_l$, based on the provided two-compartment model and experimental data.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of expressions and determination of $k_l$**\n\nThe dynamics of the viable cell population, $N(t)$, and the dead-intact cell population, $Z(t)$, are described by a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. Given that there is no cell division, the rate of change for $N(t)$ is solely due to cell death:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = -k_d N(t)\n$$\nThe population of dead-intact cells, $Z(t)$, increases as viable cells die and decreases as dead-intact cells lyse:\n$$\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = k_d N(t) - k_l Z(t)\n$$\nThe total number of intact cells, $X(t)$, is the sum of the viable and dead-intact populations:\n$$\nX(t) = N(t) + Z(t)\n$$\nThe time derivative of the total intact pool, $X(t)$, is found by summing the derivatives of its components:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\frac{dN}{dt} + \\frac{dZ}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the derivatives of $N(t)$ and $Z(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = (-k_d N(t)) + (k_d N(t) - k_l Z(t))\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = -k_l Z(t)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the time derivative of the intact pool $X(t)$.\n\nThe problem states that the $OD_{600}$ is measured to be constant over the $24$-hour interval. Since $OD_{600}$ is proportional to the total number of intact scattering particles, $X(t)$, the constancy of OD implies that $X(t)$ must also be constant. If $X(t)$ is constant, its time derivative must be zero for all $t$ in the observation interval:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = 0\n$$\nCombining this with our derived expression for $\\frac{dX}{dt}$ yields:\n$$\n-k_l Z(t) = 0\n$$\nThis equation must hold for all $t \\in [0, 24]$. We must analyze the term $Z(t)$. The initial condition is $Z(0)=0$. For $t>0$, viable cells are dying (as evidenced by the decline in CFU) and thus contributing to the population of dead-intact cells. The rate of this influx is $k_d N(t)$. Since $N(t)>0$ for the duration of the experiment and the CFU data implies $k_d>0$, the population $Z(t)$ will be non-zero for $t>0$. Therefore, for the equation $-k_l Z(t) = 0$ to be true for all $t$ where $Z(t) \\neq 0$, the constant parameter $k_l$ must be zero.\n$$\nk_l = 0 \\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the value of the lysis rate implied by the constancy of OD within this model.\n\nThe expressions for $N(t)$ and $Z(t)$ can now be fully determined. The solution to $\\frac{dN}{dt} = -k_d N(t)$ with initial condition $N(0)$ is:\n$$\nN(t) = N(0) \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nWith $k_l=0$, the equation for $Z(t)$ becomes $\\frac{dZ}{dt} = k_d N(t) = k_d N(0) \\exp(-k_d t)$. Integrating this from $0$ to $t$ with the initial condition $Z(0)=0$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dZ}{d\\tau} d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} k_d N(0) \\exp(-k_d \\tau) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\nZ(t) - Z(0) = k_d N(0) \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k_d} \\exp(-k_d \\tau) \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\nZ(t) = -N(0) (\\exp(-k_d t) - \\exp(0)) = N(0) (1 - \\exp(-k_d t))\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the death rate $k_d$**\n\nThe death rate $k_d$ is determined from the CFU data using the first-order death model $N(t) = N(0) \\exp(-k_d t)$. We are given:\n- $N(0) = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}$\n- $N(12) = 5.0 \\times 10^{8}$\n- $N(24) = 2.5 \\times 10^{8}$\n\nUsing the data point at $t=12$ hours:\n$$\nN(12) = N(0) \\exp(-k_d \\cdot 12)\n$$\n$$\n5.0 \\times 10^{8} = (1.0 \\times 10^{9}) \\exp(-12 k_d)\n$$\nDividing by $N(0)$ gives:\n$$\n0.5 = \\exp(-12 k_d)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(0.5) = -12 k_d\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(0.5) = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -12 k_d\n$$\nSolving for $k_d$:\n$$\nk_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{12} \\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nWe can verify this result using the data point at $t=24$ hours:\n$N(24) = N(0) \\exp(-k_d \\cdot 24) = (1.0 \\times 10^9) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12} \\cdot 24\\right) = (1.0 \\times 10^9) \\exp(-2\\ln(2)) = (1.0 \\times 10^9) \\exp(\\ln(2^{-2})) = (1.0 \\times 10^9) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 2.5 \\times 10^8$.

These rates depend on the net ATP available for maintenance, $\\mathrm{ATP}_{\\mathrm{avail}}$, for each genotype. $\\mathrm{ATP}_{\\mathrm{avail}}$ is determined by balancing the supply and consumption of acetyl-CoA.

Assume the following well-tested facts as your starting point: (i) first-order degradation of a protein with half-life $t_{1/2}$ implies a degradation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} = \\ln(2)/t_{1/2}$; (ii) exponential growth with doubling time $T_{d}$ dilutes intracellular protein at rate $\\mu = \\ln(2)/T_{d}$; and (iii) at steady state, the mass balance of a well-mixed intracellular species equates synthesis to total first-order loss.\n\nYou measure the RpoS protein synthesis rate per cell as a zero-order flux $\\alpha$ (molecules per cell per minute), the ClpXP-RssB mediated first-order degradation via the half-life $t_{1/2}$ (minutes), and the growth dilution via the doubling time $T_{d}$ (minutes) or the growth rate constant $\\mu$ (per minute), in two conditions:\n\n- Before carbon starvation (balanced exponential growth at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 40$ molecules $\\mathrm{cell}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{pre}} = 2.31\\,\\mathrm{min}$, and $T_{d,\\mathrm{pre}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n- After a shift to carbon starvation (entry into stationary phase, same temperature): $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}} = 100$ molecules $\\mathrm{cell}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{post}} = 13.9\\,\\mathrm{min}$, and a residual growth rate $\\mu_{\\mathrm{post}} = 0.0010\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\nAssume that RpoS-dependent promoter output is proportional to the occupancy by RpoS-holoenzyme and follows a Hill-type dependence on the steady-state RpoS level $S^{\\ast}$ (molecules per cell),\n$$f(S^{\\ast}) = \\frac{(S^{\\ast})^{n}}{K^{n} + (S^{\\ast})^{n}},$$\nwith Hill coefficient $n = 2$ and half-saturation constant $K = 500$ molecules per cell.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe dynamics of the intracellular RpoS protein level, denoted by $S(t)$, are governed by a mass balance equation. The rate of change of $S$ is the difference between the synthesis rate and the total loss rate.\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = \\text{synthesis} - \\text{degradation} - \\text{dilution} $$\nThe synthesis rate is given as a constant flux $\\alpha$. The degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$, contributing a loss term of $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}S$. The dilution due to cell growth is also a first-order process with rate constant $\\mu$, contributing a loss term of $\\mu S$. The complete differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = \\alpha - (k_{\\mathrm{deg}} + \\mu)S $$\nAt steady state, the concentration does not change, so $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$. This yields:\n$$ 0 = \\alpha - (k_{\\mathrm{deg}} + \\mu)S^{\\ast} $$\nSolving for the steady-state RpoS level, $S^{\\ast}$, provides the expression requested by the problem:\n$$ S^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}} + \\mu} $$\nThis expression will be evaluated for the two specified conditions.\n\n**Condition 1: Pre-starvation (Balanced Exponential Growth)**\nThe parameters are:\n$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{molecules}\\,\\mathrm{cell}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n$t_{1/2,\\mathrm{pre}} = 2.31\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n$T_{d,\\mathrm{pre}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the first-order rate constants for degradation and dilution:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{deg, pre}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{pre}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{2.31\\,\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 0.30006\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{d,\\mathrm{pre}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{30\\,\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 0.02310\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} $$\nNow, we calculate the steady-state RpoS level, $S^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{pre}}$:\n$$ S^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg, pre}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{pre}}} = \\frac{40}{0.30006 + 0.02310} = \\frac{40}{0.32316}\\,\\mathrm{molecules} \\approx 123.78\\,\\mathrm{molecules} $$\nThe transcriptional activity, $f_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, is calculated using the Hill function with $n=2$ and $K=500$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\frac{(S^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{pre}})^{2}}{K^{2} + (S^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{pre}})^{2}} = \\frac{(123.78)^{2}}{(500)^{2} + (123.78)^{2}} = \\frac{15321.4}{250000 + 15321.4} \\approx 0.05775 $$\n\n**Condition 2: Post-starvation (Stationary Phase)**\nThe parameters are:\n$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{molecules}\\,\\mathrm{cell}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n$t_{1/2,\\mathrm{post}} = 13.9\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n$\\mu_{\\mathrm{post}} = 0.0010\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n\nThe degradation rate constant is:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{deg, post}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{post}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{13.9\\,\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 0.04987\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} $$\nThe steady-state RpoS level, $S^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{post}}$, is:\n$$ S^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg, post}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{post}}} = \\frac{100}{0.04987 + 0.0010} = \\frac{100}{0.05087}\\,\\mathrm{molecules} \\approx 1965.8\\,\\mathrm{molecules} $$\nThe transcriptional activity, $f_{\\mathrm{post}}$, is:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\frac{(S^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{post}})^{2}}{K^{2} + (S^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{post}})^{2}} = \\frac{(1965.8)^{2}}{(500)^{2} + (1965.8)^{2}} = \\frac{3864369}{250000 + 3864369} \\approx 0.9392 $$\n\n**Final Calculation: Fold-change**\nThe fold-change in RpoS-dependent transcription is the ratio $f_{\\mathrm{post}}/f_{\\mathrm{pre}}$:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{post}}}{f_{\\mathrm{pre}}} = \\frac{0.9392}{0.05775} \\approx 16.263 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} \\approx 16.3 $$\nThis result demonstrates a strong upregulation of RpoS-dependent genes upon entry into stationary phase, driven by a combination of increased synthesis ($\\alpha$) and drastically reduced degradation (longer $t_{1/2}$), which together cause a substantial accumulation of the RpoS protein, pushing the transcriptional switch into a nearly fully \"on\" state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16.3}$$", "id": "2534404"}]}
