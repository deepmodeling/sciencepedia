Let us analyze the system upon HD-GYP deletion ($\\Delta$HD-GYP).\n\nIn the $\\Delta$HD-GYP mutant, the enzyme is absent, so its corresponding reaction fluxes are zero. That is, $v_3 = 0$ and $v_4 = 0$. Let the new steady-state concentrations be denoted by $C'$, $P'$, and $M'$, and the fluxes by $v'_i$.\n\nThe metabolic network in the $\\Delta$HD-GYP mutant is simplified as follows:\n- c-di-GMP synthesis: GGDEF, flux $v'_1$.\n- c-di-GMP degradation: EAL, flux $v'_2$.\n- pGpG degradation: Oligoribonuclease, flux $v'_5$.\n\nThe steady-state equations for the $\\Delta$HD-GYP mutant are:\n- For c-di-GMP ($C'$): $dC'/dt = v'_1 - v'_2 = 0 \\implies v'_1 = v'_2$.\n- For pGpG ($P'$): $dP'/dt = v'_2 - v'_5 = 0 \\implies v'_2 = v'_5$.\n\nWe can now predict the changes in metabolite concentrations by comparing the wild-type (WT) system to the $\\Delta$HD-GYP system.\n\n1.  **Analysis of c-di-GMP Concentration ($C$):**\n    In the WT strain, two enzymes, EAL and HD-GYP, contribute to the degradation of c-di-GMP with a total flux of $v_2 + v_3$. In the $\\Delta$HD-GYP mutant, only EAL is active, with degradation flux $v'_2$. The deletion removes a significant pathway for c-di-GMP clearance ($v_3$). Assuming the synthesis flux $v_1$ does not perfectly and instantaneously adapt to compensate, the reduction in total degradation capacity will lead to an accumulation of the substrate.\n    Therefore, the concentration of c-di-GMP is predicted to increase: $C' > C$.\n\n2.  **Analysis of pGpG Concentration ($P$):**\n    In the WT strain, pGpG is degraded by two enzymes, HD-GYP ($v_4$) and the oligoribonuclease ($v_5$). In the $\\Delta$HD-GYP mutant, the degradation pathway catalyzed by HD-GYP ($v_4$) is eliminated. pGpG is now degraded solely by the oligoribonuclease ($v'_5$). The removal of a key degradation enzyme for pGpG will cause its concentration to rise significantly, as the remaining clearance pathway ($v'_5$) may not be sufficient to handle the flux at the previous steady-state concentration.\n    Therefore, the concentration of pGpG is predicted to increase markedly: $P' > P$.\n\n3.  **Analysis of GMP Concentration ($M$):**\n    In the WT strain, GMP is produced from pGpG by both HD-GYP ($v_4$) and the oligoribonuclease ($v_5$). In the $\\Delta$HD-GYP mutant, the flux $v_4$ is zero. Production of GMP from pGpG now occurs only via the oligoribonuclease ($v'_5$). The loss of one of the two production pathways for GMP from this network reduces the total flux towards GMP. Assuming constant consumption of GMP by other cellular processes, a decrease in its production flux from the c-di-GMP pathway will lead to a lower steady-state concentration.\n    Therefore, the concentration of GMP is predicted to decrease: $M' < M$.\n\n**Methodological Approach:**\nThe most rigorous method to quantify the contributions of EAL and HD-GYP involves measuring the system's response to their selective removal. This is precisely what a knockout experiment achieves. Using isotope-dilution LC-MS provides the necessary absolute quantification of metabolite pools ($C$, $P$, $M$). By comparing the metabolite profiles across the wild-type, $\\Delta$EAL, and $\\Delta$HD-GYP strains, and applying the principles of mass balance (as captured by the steady-state equations), one can infer the relative importance of the deleted enzymatic pathways. For instance, a very large increase in $C$ upon EAL deletion would imply EAL is the dominant phosphodiesterase. Comparing product ratios like $P:M$ is also informative, as this ratio is sensitive to the relative activities of the enzymes that consume $P$ (HD-GYP and oligoribonuclease).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Use isotope-dilution LC–MS to quantify $C$, $P$, and $M$ in wild type, EAL deletion, and HD-GYP deletion strains at steady state.

Predict no substantial change in $P$ upon HD-GYP deletion.**\n- **Methodology:** The question is explicitly about c-di-GMP turnover. Shifting the analysis to c-di-AMP is irrelevant to the stated problem.\n- **Predictions:** The prediction of \"no substantial change in $P$\" is incorrect. We derived that $P$ should increase markedly due to the removal of a major degradation enzyme (HD-GYP).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

Isotope-dilution internal standards are required. The assumption that $C$ is buffered constant is a strong, unsupported assumption that would prevent observation of the primary effect of PDE deletion.\n- **Predictions:** The prediction that $P$ decreases is incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nThus, Option A provides both a rigorous methodological plan and a correct set of predictions based on the provided model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2531709"}]}
