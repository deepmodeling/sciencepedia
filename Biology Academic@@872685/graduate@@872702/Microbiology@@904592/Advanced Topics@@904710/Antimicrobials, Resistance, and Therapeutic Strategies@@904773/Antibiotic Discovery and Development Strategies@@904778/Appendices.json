It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of microbiology, specifically concerning the quantitative assessment of drug interactions. All necessary data for a unique solution are provided, and no inconsistencies or ambiguities are present. We shall proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe central concept is the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index, or $FICI$. This index is a quantitative measure used to determine the nature of the interaction between two antimicrobial agents. An interaction can be classified as synergistic, additive, indifferent, or antagonistic based on the value of the $FICI$. The problem requires the calculation of this index from the provided experimental data.\n\nThe definition of the $FICI$ is the sum of the Fractional Inhibitory Concentrations ($FIC$) for each drug in the combination. For a two-drug system involving drug $A$ and drug $B$, the formula is:\n$$FICI = FIC_A + FIC_B$$\nThe $FIC$ for each drug is the ratio of its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ($MIC$) when used in combination to its $MIC$ when used alone.\nLet $MIC_A$ be the $MIC$ of drug $A$ alone.\nLet $MIC_B$ be the $MIC$ of drug $B$ alone.\nLet $MIC_{A,comb}$ be the $MIC$ of drug $A$ in the presence of drug $B$.\nLet $MIC_{B,comb}$ be the $MIC$ of drug $B$ in the presence of drug $A$.\n\nThe individual $FIC$ values are thus defined as:\n$$FIC_A = \\frac{MIC_{A,comb}}{MIC_A}$$\n$$FIC_B = \\frac{MIC_{B,comb}}{MIC_B}$$\n\nCombining these definitions, the full expression for the $FICI$ is:\n$$FICI = \\frac{MIC_{A,comb}}{MIC_A} + \\frac{MIC_{B,comb}}{MIC_B}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values from the problem statement into this formula.

The scenario of a trade-off between binding affinity and accumulation is a realistic problem in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe first task is to determine how the $MIC$ scales with the association constant $K_a$ and the accumulation factor $A$.
