The solution must be derived strictly from conservation principles as stated. We will deconstruct the overall metabolic process into its two major stages: the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, also known as glycolysis, and the subsequent fermentation of pyruvate to lactate.\n\nFirst, we analyze the stoichiometry of the EMP pathway for the catabolism of $1$ mole of glucose ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6$) to $2$ moles of pyruvate ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_4\\text{O}_3$). This pathway is divided into an energy-investment phase and an energy-payoff phase.\n\nIn the preparatory, or energy-investment, phase, $2$ moles of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are consumed per mole of glucose.\n1. The phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by hexokinase, consumes $1$ mole of ATP.\n2. The phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, catalyzed by phosphofructokinase, consumes another mole of ATP.\nThus, the total ATP investment is $2$ moles.\n\nIn the payoff phase, the $6$-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two $3$-carbon molecules. All subsequent reactions, therefore, occur twice for each initial molecule of glucose.\n1. The oxidation of $2$ moles of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to $2$ moles of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate results in the reduction of $2$ moles of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($\\text{NAD}^+$) to $2$ moles of $\\text{NADH}$. This is the sole redox reaction in glycolysis producing reducing equivalents.\n2. The conversion of $2$ moles of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to $2$ moles of 3-phosphoglycerate, a substrate-level phosphorylation step, generates $2$ moles of ATP.\n3. The conversion of $2$ moles of phosphoenolpyruvate to $2$ moles of pyruvate, another substrate-level phosphorylation step, generates an additional $2$ moles of ATP.\nThe total ATP produced in the payoff phase is therefore $2 + 2 = 4$ moles.\n\nThe net ATP yield from glycolysis is the total ATP produced minus the total ATP consumed:\n$$ \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{glycolysis}} = (4 \\, \\text{moles}) - (2 \\, \\text{moles}) = 2 \\, \\text{moles} $$\nThe net production of NADH from glycolysis is:\n$$ \\text{Net NADH}_{\\text{glycolysis}} = 2 \\, \\text{moles} $$\nThe net reaction for glycolysis is:\n$$ \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 + 2 \\, \\text{ADP} + 2 \\, \\text{P}_i + 2 \\, \\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_4\\text{O}_3 + 2 \\, \\text{ATP} + 2 \\, \\text{NADH} + 2 \\, \\text{H}^+ + 2 \\, \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\n\nSecond, we analyze the fermentation step. Under anoxic conditions, the $2$ moles of $\\text{NADH}$ produced during glycolysis must be reoxidized to $\\text{NAD}^+$ to sustain the glycolytic flux. The problem specifies homolactic fermentation, where pyruvate acts as the terminal electron acceptor. The reaction, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase, is:\n$$ \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{Lactate} + \\text{NAD}^+ $$\nSince $2$ moles of pyruvate are produced from $1$ mole of glucose, this reaction consumes $2$ moles of $\\text{NADH}$:\n$$ 2 \\, \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_4\\text{O}_3 + 2 \\, \\text{NADH} + 2 \\, \\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_6\\text{O}_3 + 2 \\, \\text{NAD}^+ $$\nThis step does not involve any ATP consumption or production. Therefore, the ATP change during fermentation is $0$. The NADH consumed is $2$ moles.\n\nFinally, we determine the net yields for the complete process of converting $1$ mole of glucose to $2$ moles of lactate. We sum the changes from both stages.\n\nThe overall net ATP yield is the sum of the net ATP from glycolysis and the ATP change from fermentation:\n$$ \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{total}} = \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{glycolysis}} + \\text{ATP}_{\\text{fermentation}} = (2 \\, \\text{moles}) + (0 \\, \\text{moles}) = 2 \\, \\text{moles} $$\n\nThe net change in cytosolic NADH is the amount produced in glycolysis minus the amount consumed in fermentation:\n$$ \\Delta\\text{NADH}_{\\text{total}} = (\\text{NADH produced}) - (\\text{NADH consumed}) = (2 \\, \\text{moles}) - (2 \\, \\text{moles}) = 0 \\, \\text{moles} $$\nThis result of zero net change for the redox cofactor is a requisite for any sustainable anaerobic fermentation process, as the internal pool of $\\text{NAD}^+$/$\\text{NADH}$ must be regenerated. It is a direct consequence of redox balance. The overall reaction is:\n$$ \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 + 2 \\, \\text{ADP} + 2 \\, \\text{P}_i \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{C}_3\\text{H}_6\\text{O}_3 + 2 \\, \\text{ATP} + 2 \\, \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\nThis confirms mass conservation and demonstrates that the process is redox-neutral with no external electron acceptor.\n\nThe requested quantities are the net ATP yield ($2$ mol/mol glucose) and the net change in cytosolic NADH ($0$ mol/mol glucose).

The stoichiometry of the EMP pathway for one mole of glucose is as follows:\n\n1.  Energy Investment Phase: Two kinase reactions consume ATP.\n    - Hexokinase: $\\text{Glucose} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ADP}$.

This consumes $1$ mole of ATP.\n    - Total ATP investment is $2$ moles per mole of glucose.\n\n2.  Energy Payoff Phase: Substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) generates ATP. The pathway splits the $6$-carbon sugar into two $3$-carbon units, so the following reactions occur twice per mole of glucose.\n    - Phosphoglycerate kinase: $2 \\times (\\text{1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{3-Phosphoglycerate} + \\text{ATP})$. This generates $2$ moles of ATP.\n    - Pyruvate kinase: $2 \\times (\\text{Phosphoenolpyruvate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{ATP})$. This generates $2$ moles of ATP.\n    - Total gross ATP production from SLP is $2 + 2 = 4$ moles per mole of glucose.\n\n3.  Redox Balance: During glycolysis, the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate produces $2$ moles of $\\text{NADH}$.

This step does not involve transmembrane proton translocation and thus does not contribute to oxidative phosphorylation. It serves only to regenerate the $\\text{NAD}^+$ required for glycolysis to continue.\n    $$ 2 \\text{ Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{ NADH} + 2 \\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ Lactate} + 2 \\text{ NAD}^+ $$\n    Since there is no further energy capture, the total net yield for homolactic fermentation is solely from the SLP in glycolysis.\n\n    $$ Y_{\\mathrm{ferm}} = (\\text{ATP produced by SLP}) - (\\text{ATP invested}) = 4 - 2 = 2 $$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of ATP Yield for Anaerobic Respiration with Nitrate ($Y_{\\mathrm{nitrate}}$)\n\nThis process involves the complete oxidation of glucose to $\\text{CO}_2$ coupled with an electron transport chain that uses nitrate as the terminal acceptor.\n\n1.  Yield of Energy Carriers: The problem statement provides the total yield from the complete oxidation of one mole of glucose via glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.\n    - ATP from SLP: $2$ ATP from glycolysis plus $2$ GTP (counted as $2$ ATP) from the TCA cycle.
