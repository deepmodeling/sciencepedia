Microbial cells are modeled as rigid, non-overlapping circular disks of fixed radius $r$ whose centers form a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process with intensity $\\lambda$ (mean number of centers per unit area equal to $\\lambda$). The standard unbiased counting-frame rule is used: two adjacent edges of the square are designated as inclusion edges, and the opposite two edges are designated as exclusion edges; a disk is counted if and only if it lies entirely within the frame or intersects an inclusion edge and does not intersect an exclusion edge. Consider an incorrect practice in which an observer ignores every disk that touches any boundary line (that is, the observer counts only disks that are strictly fully contained within the square at a distance at least $r$ from all four edges).

It is based on standard principles of spatial statistics and quantitative microscopy, specifically the modeling of object distributions with a homogeneous Poisson point process. The definitions and parameters provided are clear and consistent, allowing for a rigorous mathematical derivation. The problem is declared valid.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining the effective sampling area under the specified incorrect counting rule. The number of objects counted in a region is a random variable, and for a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process, its expected value is the product of the process intensity, $\\lambda$, and the area of the region from which the objects' centers are sampled.\n\nLet the counting frame be a square in the $xy$-plane defined by $0 \\le x \\le L$ and $0 \\le y \\le L$. The total area of this frame is $A_{\\text{frame}} = L^2$. Microbial cells are modeled as circular disks of radius $r$. The centers of these disks are distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process with intensity $\\lambda$.\n\nThe density estimator is defined as $\\hat{\\lambda} = N/L^2$, where $N$ is the number of counted cells. The expected value of this estimator is $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}] = \\mathbb{E}[N]/L^2$.\n\nThe problem describes an incorrect counting practice, which we denote by the subscript \"ignore\". According to this rule, a disk is counted only if it is strictly fully contained within the square frame. For a circular disk of radius $r$ with center at $(x_c, y_c)$ to be fully contained within the square defined by $0 \\le x \\le L$ and $0 \\le y \\le L$, its center must satisfy the conditions:\n$$\nr \\le x_c \\le L-r\n$$\n$$\nr \\le y_c \\le L-r\n$$\nThese inequalities define a smaller, concentric square region within which the center of a counted disk must lie. The side length of this inner square is $(L-r) - r = L-2r$. This region represents the effective sampling area for the cell centers under the \"ignore\" rule. Let us denote this area as $A_{\\text{ignore}}$.\n$$\nA_{\\text{ignore}} = (L-2r)^{2}\n$$\nThe number of cells counted using this incorrect rule, $N_{\\text{ignore}}$, corresponds to the number of points of the Poisson process that fall within this effective area $A_{\\text{ignore}}$. The expected value of $N_{\\text{ignore}}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\text{ignore}}] = \\lambda \\cdot A_{\\text{ignore}} = \\lambda(L-2r)^{2}\n$$\nThe expected value of the corresponding density estimator, $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{ignore}}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{ignore}}] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\text{ignore}}]}{L^2} = \\frac{\\lambda(L-2r)^{2}}{L^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the relative bias, $b$, defined as $b \\equiv \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{ignore}}]}{\\lambda} - 1$. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{ignore}}]$:\n$$\nb = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda(L-2r)^{2}}{L^2} \\right) - 1\n$$\nThe intensity $\\lambda$ cancels out, yielding the general expression for the relative bias in terms of the geometric parameters $L$ and $r$:\n$$\nb = \\frac{(L-2r)^{2}}{L^2} - 1 = \\left( \\frac{L-2r}{L} \\right)^{2} - 1 = \\left( 1 - \\frac{2r}{L} \\right)^{2} - 1\n$$\nThis expression shows that the bias is negative, since $2r/L > 0$ (for non-zero cell size) and we assume $L > 2r$ for any counting to be possible. A negative bias signifies a systematic underestimation of the true density $\\lambda$, which is logical as the incorrect rule discards all cells that touch the boundary.\n\nNext, we specialize this result to the given numerical values.

The microbial cells have a diameter of $1\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, which means the radius is $r = 0.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\nThe dimensionless ratio $\\frac{2r}{L}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{2r}{L} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{50\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{1\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{50\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{1}{50} = 0.02\n$$\nSubstituting this value into our derived expression for the relative bias $b$:\n$$\nb = (1 - 0.02)^{2} - 1 = (0.98)^{2} - 1\n$$\nWe compute the value of $(0.98)^{2}$:\n$$\n(0.98)^{2} = 0.9604\n$$\nTherefore, the relative bias is:\n$$\nb = 0.9604 - 1 = -0.0396\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.
