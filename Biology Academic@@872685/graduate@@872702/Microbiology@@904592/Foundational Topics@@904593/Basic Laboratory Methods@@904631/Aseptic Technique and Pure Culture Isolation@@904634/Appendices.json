It is a solvable problem in applied probability and spatial statistics, relevant to the field of microbiology.\n\nThe objective is to find the dilution factor $d^{\\ast}$ that maximizes the expected number of non-overlapping colonies, subject to a constraint on the mean number of colonies plated, $\\lambda$. The problem is defined by the following parameters:\n- Initial bacterial concentration: $C = 1.0 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ CFU mL}^{-1}$\n- Plated volume: $V = 0.100\\,\\text{mL}$\n- Plate diameter: $D_{plate} = 100\\,\\text{mm}$\n- Colony diameter: $D = 3.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n- Constraint on mean count $\\lambda$: $N_{\\min} \\le \\lambda \\le N_{\\max}$, where $N_{\\min} = 30$ and $N_{\\max} = 300$.\n\nThe mean number of colony-forming units (CFUs) plated is $\\lambda = \\frac{CV}{d}$. The problem is to maximize the expected number of isolated colonies, $E[N_{iso}]$, by choosing $d$. This is equivalent to choosing an optimal $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ within the given range and then calculating the corresponding $d^{\\ast}$.\n\nAccording to the provided assumptions, the colony centers form a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) on the circular agar plate, which we denote as the disk $S$. The area of the plate is $A = \\pi (\\frac{D_{plate}}{2})^2$. The intensity of the HPPP is $\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{A}$.\n\nThe non-overlap condition states that two colonies with centers $c_i$ and $c_j$ do not overlap if the distance $|c_i - c_j|$ exceeds twice their radius, $2r = D$. Therefore, a colony with center $c_i$ is considered \"isolated\" if no other colony center $c_j$ ($j \\neq i$) lies within the disk of radius $D$ centered at $c_i$. The area of this exclusion disk is $A_{ex} = \\pi D^2$.\n\nThe expected number of isolated colonies can be found using the thinning property of a Poisson process. For each point of the HPPP, we determine if it is isolated. This results in a new point process of isolated colonies. The probability that a given point is retained (i.e., is isolated) depends on its location on the plate due to edge effects. A point near the edge of the plate has a larger probability of being isolated because a portion of its exclusion disk lies outside the plate, where no other centers can exist.\n\nCalculating the exact expectation requires integrating the position-dependent isolation probability over the plate area, which is analytically intractable. However, the problem can be solved under the standard and reasonable assumption that edge effects are negligible. This assumption is justified when the exclusion radius ($D = 3.0\\,\\text{mm}$) is much smaller than the plate radius ($R_{plate} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\\,\\text{mm}$). The ratio $\\frac{D}{R_{plate}} = \\frac{3}{50} = 0.06$, which is small.\n\nUnder the assumption of negligible edge effects, we can approximate the isolation probability as being uniform for all colonies across the plate. This probability, $p_{iso}$, is the probability that no other points of the process fall into the exclusion disk of area $A_{ex}$. For a HPPP, this void probability is given by:\n$$p_{iso} = \\exp(-\\rho A_{ex})$$\nThe process of isolated colonies is then a thinned Poisson process with a new intensity $\\rho_{iso} = \\rho \\cdot p_{iso}$.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $C_i$ be the random variable representing the total number of colony-forming units (CFU) observed in sector $i$. This total is the sum of two independent components: the number of CFUs from the target organism, which we denote as $N_i'$, and the number of CFUs from environmental contamination, denoted as $N_i''$.\n$$C_i = N_i' + N_i''$$\nDue to the independence of these processes, the expectation of the total count is the sum of the individual expectations, a property known as linearity of expectation:\n$$E[C_i] = E[N_i'] + E[N_i'']$$\nWe will now derive an expression for each term.\n\nFirst, we analyze the contamination component, $N_i''$. The problem states that contamination is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process along the streak path of length $L_i$ in sector $i$, with a rate of $\\mu$ CFUs per centimeter.

In graph-theoretic terms, represent the operator’s hands as a source node and the target sterile substrate as a sink node. A feasible contamination route is any directed path from the source to the sink.

From $G$, paths can proceed to $I_{\\ell}$, $I_{p}$, or $I_{f}$. From these instrument nodes, paths proceed to the access-point nodes $E$ or $R$.

The subset in $\\mathcal{V}_{\\text{ctrl}}$ is $V_{\\text{ctrl}}(P_{4}) = \\{I_{f}, E\\}$.\n\nTo determine the minimum cardinality of the cut set, we will establish a lower bound and an upper bound.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nThe minimum size of a vertex separator is related to the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths. Given the constraint that the separator must be a subset of $\\mathcal{V}_{\\text{ctrl}}$, we must find the maximum number of paths from $H$ to $S$ that are disjoint with respect to their vertices from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\text{ctrl}}$.\nLet's examine paths $P_{3}$ and $P_{4}$.\n-   The eligible control points on path $P_{3}$ are $V_{\\text{ctrl}}(P_{3}) = \\{I_{p}, R\\}$.\n-   The eligible control points on path $P_{4}$ are $V_{\\text{ctrl}}(P_{4}) = \\{I_{f}, E\\}$.\nThe intersection of these two sets is $V_{\\text{ctrl}}(P_{3}) \\cap V_{\\text{ctrl}}(P_{4}) = \\{I_{p}, R\\} \\cap \\{I_{f}, E\\} = \\emptyset$.\nThis means that paths $P_{3}$ and $P_{4}$ are disjoint in terms of the nodes that can be removed. A cut set $C$ must sever both paths. To sever $P_{3}$, $C$ must contain at least one node from $\\{I_{p}, R\\}$. To sever $P_{4}$, $C$ must contain at least one node from $\\{I_{f}, E\\}$. Since these two sets of nodes are disjoint, any cut set $C$ must contain at least one element from the first set and one element from the second set. Therefore, the cardinality of any valid cut set $C$ must be at least $2$.\n$$|C| \\ge 2$$\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nNow we must demonstrate that a cut set of cardinality $2$ exists. Consider the set of access-point nodes $C' = \\{E, R\\}$.\n1.  Cardinality: The size of this set is $|C'| = 2$.\n2.

Separator property: We must verify that removing nodes $E$ and $R$ disconnects all paths from $H$ to $S$. By inspecting the edge set $\\mathcal{E}$, the only edges that lead to the sink node $S$ are $(E,S)$ and $(R,S)$. This implies that any path from $H$ to $S$ must contain either the vertex $E$ or the vertex $R$ as its penultimate node. By removing both $E$ and $R$, we remove all possible immediate predecessors of $S$, making it impossible for any path to reach $S$. Thus, $C' = \\{E, R\\}$ is a valid $H$-$S$ vertex separator.\n\nSince we have established a lower bound of $2$ for the cardinality of any valid cut set and have constructed a valid cut set of cardinality $2$, the minimum cardinality of such a set must be exactly $2$.\n\nThis corresponds to the practical principle in microbiology that controlling contamination requires blocking multiple, independent pathways. In this model, controlling both the plate exposure area ($E$) and the tube opening area ($R$) is one minimal strategy to ensure sterility of the target substrate $S$ from hand-borne contaminants channeled through instruments.\nThe minimum cardinality is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2475086"}]}
