A reviewer flags potential problems with tautonyms, rank-specific suffixes, and gender agreement of adjectival species epithets. You are asked to diagnose and correct the issues in a way that is fully compliant with the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP).\n\nFoundational definitions and facts:\n- Under the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP), a species name is a Latinized binomen whose specific epithet can be an adjective, a noun in the genitive case, or a noun in apposition. If it is an adjective, it must agree in grammatical gender with the generic name.\n- Tautonyms (the generic name and the specific epithet being identical strings) are not permitted for prokaryotes.\n- Names of families are formed from the stem of the type genus name plus the suffix -aceae. Names of orders are formed from the stem of the type genus name plus the suffix -ales. The stem is typically obtained by removing the nominative singular ending of the type genus and applying standard Latin stem formation.\n\nConsider the following author-proposed names and intents:\n- $1$) *Nitrosopumilus marina*, where the author states the epithet is intended as an adjective meaning “marine” and the generic name *Nitrosopumilus* is to be treated as masculine.\n- $2$) A new family for the type genus *Methanococcus* is proposed as “Methanococcusidae.”\n- $3$) A new order for the taxon typified by the genus *Spirochaeta* is proposed as “Spirochaetaceae.”\n- $4$) A new species “*Bacillus bacillus*” is proposed; the epithet was intended as a descriptive reference to rod shape but results in a tautonym.\n\nWhich one of the following options lists a set of corrections that are each fully compliant with the ICNP, simultaneously addressing proper adjectival gender agreement (where explicitly intended by the author), correct rank-forming suffixes from the appropriate type genus stems, and elimination of tautonyms by a valid, Latinized alternative?\n\nA. \n- $1$) *Nitrosopumilus marinus*\n- $2$) Methanococcaceae\n- $3$) Spirochaetales\n- $4$) *Bacillus bacilliformis*\n\nB. \n- $1$) *Nitrosopumilus maris*\n- $2$) Methanococcidae\n- $3$) Spirochaetales\n- $4$) *Bacillus bacillus*\n\nC. \n- $1$) *Nitrosopumilus maritima*\n- $2$) Methanococcaceae\n- $3$) Spirochaetales\n- $4$) *Bacillus bacilli*\n\nD. \n- $1$) *Nitrosopumilus marinus*\n- $2$) Methanococcaceae\n- $3$) Spirochaetaceae\n- $4$) *Bacillus bacilliforme*", "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to a rigorous validation procedure before any attempt at a solution is made.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following definitions, facts, and proposed names:\n\n*   **Rule $1$**: A species name is a Latinized binomen. The specific epithet can be an adjective, a noun in the genitive case, or a noun in apposition. Adjectival epithets must agree in grammatical gender with the generic name.\n*   **Rule $2$**: Tautonyms (generic name and specific epithet are identical) are not permitted for prokaryotes under the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP).\n*   **Rule $3$**: Family names are formed from the stem of the type genus name plus the suffix `-aceae`.\n*   **Rule $4$**: Order names are formed from the stem of the type genus name plus the suffix `-ales`.\n*   **Proposed Item $1$**: The name *Nitrosopumilus marina*, where the epithet is intended as an adjective meaning \"marine\" and the generic name *Nitrosopumilus* is to be treated as masculine.\n*   **Proposed Item $2$**: A new family for the type genus *Methanococcus* is proposed as \"Methanococcusidae\".\n*   **Proposed Item $3$**: A new order for the taxon typified by the genus *Spirochaeta* is proposed as \"Spirochaetaceae\".\n*   **Proposed Item $4$**: A new species \"*Bacillus bacillus*\" is proposed, with the intent of a descriptive reference to rod shape.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based entirely on the established principles of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP). The rules cited for gender agreement, tautonyms, and rank-specific suffixes are factually correct representations of the Code.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a set of specific nomenclatural errors and asks for their correction based on a provided, consistent set of rules. This structure leads to a unique and verifiable set of correct names.\n*   **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of ambiguity or subjective claims. The task is a direct application of formal rules.\n*   **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information to derive the solution, including the proposed names, the intended meanings, the grammatical gender of a generic name, the type genera for higher taxa, and the relevant ICNP rules.\n\nThere are no scientific or logical flaws, inconsistencies, or ambiguities. The problem is a straightforward and formal exercise in applying established nomenclatural rules.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to correct four proposed prokaryotic names in accordance with the ICNP. Each item is analyzed independently.\n\n**Analysis of Item $1$**: *Nitrosopumilus marina*\n*   **Given**: The generic name *Nitrosopumilus* is masculine. The specific epithet *marina* is intended as an adjective.\n*   **Principle**: An adjectival specific epithet must agree in gender with the generic name.\n*   **Derivation**: The Latin adjective for \"marine\" is *marinus* (masculine), *marina* (feminine), and *marinum* (neuter). Since *Nitrosopumilus* is a masculine genus, the masculine form of the adjective, *marinus*, must be used.\n*   **Correction**: The correct name is *Nitrosopumilus marinus*.\n\n**Analysis of Item $2$**: Family proposed as \"Methanococcusidae\"\n*   **Given**: The type genus for the family is *Methanococcus*.\n*   **Principle**: The name of a family is formed by adding the suffix `-aceae` to the stem of the name of the type genus.\n*   **Derivation**: The genus name is *Methanococcus*. The stem is obtained by removing the case ending (`-us`) from the nominative singular, yielding `Methanococc-`. Appending the correct family suffix `-aceae` results in the name Methanococcaceae. The proposed suffix `-idae` is the standard suffix for family names in zoology, not prokaryotic nomenclature.\n*   **Correction**: The correct family name is Methanococcaceae.\n\n**Analysis of Item $3$**: Order proposed as \"Spirochaetaceae\"\n*   **Given**: A new order is typified by the genus *Spirochaeta*.\n*   **Principle**: The name of an order is formed by adding the suffix `-ales` to the stem of the name of the type genus.\n*   **Derivation**: The proposed name `Spirochaetaceae` uses the suffix for a family (`-aceae`), which is incorrect for the rank of order. The type genus is *Spirochaeta*. Its stem is `Spirochaet-`. Appending the correct suffix for an order, `-ales`, gives the name Spirochaetales.\n*   **Correction**: The correct order name is Spirochaetales.\n\n**Analysis of Item $4$**: Species proposed as \"*Bacillus bacillus*\"\n*   **Given**: The proposed name is a binomen where the generic name and specific epithet are identical.\n*   **Principle**: Tautonyms are not permitted in prokaryotic nomenclature.\n*   **Derivation**: The proposed name *Bacillus bacillus* is a clear tautonym and is therefore invalid. A new epithet must be chosen. The problem asks for a valid, Latinized alternative that respects the author's intent (\"descriptive reference to rod shape\"). A common method for this is to form a compound adjective. The name *bacilliformis* (meaning \"rod-shaped\" or \"in the form of a small rod\") is a correctly formed Latin adjective. *Bacillus* is a masculine noun, and the adjective *bacilliformis* is a third-declension adjective of two terminations (`-is` for masculine/feminine, `-e` for neuter), so *bacilliformis* correctly agrees in gender with *Bacillus*. This is a valid and appropriate correction.\n*   **Correction**: A valid correction is *Bacillus bacilliformis*.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe correct set of corrections is:\n$1$) *Nitrosopumilus marinus*\n$2$) Methanococcaceae\n$3$) Spirochaetales\n$4$) *Bacillus bacilliformis*\n\nWe now evaluate each option against this reference set.\n\n**Option A**:\n*   $1$) *Nitrosopumilus marinus* - **Correct**. Matches our derived correction for gender agreement.\n*   $2$) Methanococcaceae - **Correct**. Matches our derived correction for the family suffix.\n*   $3$) Spirochaetales - **Correct**. Matches our derived correction for the order suffix.\n*   $4$) *Bacillus bacilliformis* - **Correct**. Provides a valid and grammatically correct replacement for the tautonym.\nAll four corrections in this option are fully compliant with the ICNP.\n\n**Verdict for Option A: Correct**\n\n**Option B**:\n*   $1$) *Nitrosopumilus maris* - Incorrect. While *maris* (genitive singular of *mare*, \"of the sea\") would form a valid name, it is a noun in the genitive case. The problem explicitly states the author's intent was to use an adjective, and the task is to correct the error based on that intent, which means correcting the gender of the adjective.\n*   $2$) Methanococcidae - Incorrect. This uses the zoological suffix for a family, not the prokaryotic suffix `-aceae`.\n*   $3$) Spirochaetales - Correct.\n*   $4$) *Bacillus bacillus* - Incorrect. This is the original invalid tautonym.\nThis option contains multiple errors.\n\n**Verdict for Option B: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C**:\n*   $1$) *Nitrosopumilus maritima* - Incorrect. This uses a different adjective (*maritimus*) and its feminine form (*maritima*), which does not agree with the masculine genus *Nitrosopumilus*.\n*   $2$) Methanococcaceae - Correct.\n*   $3$) Spirochaetales - Correct.\n*   $4$) *Bacillus bacilli* - This is a grammatically valid correction, using a noun in the genitive singular (\"of a small rod\") to avoid the tautonym. However, option A provides a list where *all* items are correct, whereas this option (C) has an error in item $1$. Therefore, regardless of the validity of this specific item, the option as a whole is incorrect.\n\n**Verdict for Option C: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D**:\n*   $1$) *Nitrosopumilus marinus* - Correct.\n*   $2$) Methanococcaceae - Correct.\n*   $3$) Spirochaetaceae - Incorrect. This is the original error, using a family suffix for an order.\n*   $4$) *Bacillus bacilliforme* - Incorrect. This is the neuter form of the adjective *bacilliformis*. The generic name *Bacillus* is masculine, so this is a gender agreement error.\nThis option contains multiple errors.\n\n**Verdict for Option D: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, only Option A presents a set of corrections where every item is valid and compliant with the ICNP rules stated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2512746"}, {"introduction": "While nomenclatural rules provide a framework for creating new names, taxonomy also involves curating the historical record.

Working through this scenario will teach you the formal procedures under the ICNP for resolving such issues to preserve nomenclatural stability, a critical skill for maintaining the integrity of our classification systems.", "problem": "A species was validly published in $1954$ under the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) with a designated type strain, deposited in $2$ public culture collections in different countries, and widely used in the literature. Decades later, a polyphasic reevaluation using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH)—in conjunction with classical phenotypes—reveals that the historical type strain material currently distributed by both collections is a stable mixture composed of two separable components, named component $\\mathrm{A}$ and component $\\mathrm{B}$ for this analysis.\n\nEvidence includes: the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence of the historical mixed culture shows double chromatogram peaks at diagnostic sites; single-colony isolates from the same ampoule yield pure cultures $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ whose genomes share $ANI=86.4\\%$ and $dDDH=28.7\\%$, indicating they are different species by modern thresholds (for example, $ANI\\approx 95\\%$ and $dDDH\\approx 70\\%$ for conspecificity); phylogenomic placement shows $\\mathrm{A}$ belongs to the genus originally assigned in the protologue, whereas $\\mathrm{B}$ falls into a different, though related, genus. The original protologue reports alginate utilization and growth at $10$–$35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ in $3\\%$ sodium chloride; component $\\mathrm{A}$ exhibits these traits, while component $\\mathrm{B}$ does not utilize alginate and grows at $15$–$42\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ in $1\\%$ sodium chloride. The original freeze-dried ampoules are nearly exhausted, but the two components can be stably purified from the extant mixed holdings. There is extensive, prevailing usage of the name in the literature referring to organisms matching component $\\mathrm{A}$’s characteristics.\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions and rules of the ICNP—specifically, that the name of a species is permanently attached to its nomenclatural type (the type strain), that names are governed by the principle of priority and by valid publication requirements including deposition of the type in at least $2$ public service culture collections in different countries, and that when a type strain is lost, unsuitable, or cannot be unambiguously defined a neotype may be designated subject to the procedures and oversight of the Judicial Commission of the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP)—select the option that most correctly outlines the scientifically and nomenclaturally sound sequence of corrective actions to resolve this case under the ICNP. Your choice should clearly distinguish taxonomic circumscription from nomenclatural acts, maintain nomenclatural stability when possible, and respect required venues and procedures for formal acts.\n\nA. Document the mixture with multiple independent lines of evidence; separate and purify components $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$; test against the protologue to identify which component best matches the original description and prevailing usage. Restrict the application of the existing name to the matching component by proposing, with full evidentiary support, the designation of a neotype (or the fixation of the purified derivative as the nomenclatural type if demonstrably traceable) for the species, ensuring deposition of the selected type in at least $2$ recognized public culture collections in different countries. Publish an emended species description and the neotype designation in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM), allowing for the period of objection and, if necessary, submitting a Request for an Opinion to the Judicial Commission to fix the application of the name. For the non-matching component, undertake a separate taxonomic study and either assign it to an existing species or validly publish it as a new species with its own type strain and deposition, clarifying any resulting heterotypic synonyms and new combinations.\n\nB. Because the original type strain material is a mixture, immediately suppress the historical name as invalid and coin two entirely new species names for components $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$, without reference to the protologue, without engaging the Judicial Commission, and without emending any descriptions or considering prevailing usage, thereby avoiding the complexity of neotype designation.\n\nC. Retain the mixed culture as the type to preserve historical continuity, but divide the species into two biovars corresponding to components $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$, each anchored by a separate reference genome.

Choose the higher-quality genome assembly (either $\\mathrm{A}$ or $\\mathrm{B}$) as the sequence type and register the name under a genome-sequence code of nomenclature, thereby fixing the name by genome alone without the need for viable cultures, deposits in culture collections, or engagement with the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM) or the Judicial Commission, which are unnecessary if a genome is available.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- A species was validly published in $1954$ under the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP).\n- A type strain was designated and deposited in $2$ public culture collections in different countries.\n- The species name is in wide use.\n- Reevaluation shows the type strain material is a stable mixture of two components, `A` and `B`.\n- Evidence of mixture:\n    - Double chromatogram peaks in the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence.\n    - Pure cultures `A` and `B` can be isolated.\n    - Genomic data: Average Nucleotide Identity ($ANI$) between `A` and `B` is $86.4\\%$; digital DNA–DNA hybridization ($dDDH$) is $28.7\\%$.\n    - These values are below the species thresholds of $ANI \\approx 95\\%$ and $dDDH \\approx 70\\%$, confirming `A` and `B` are different species.\n    - Component `A` belongs to the originally assigned genus; component `B` belongs to a different genus.\n- Comparison with original description (protologue):\n    - Protologue: Alginate utilization; growth at $10$–$35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; growth in $3\\%$ sodium chloride.\n    - Component `A`: Matches these characteristics.\n    - Component `B`: Does not utilize alginate; grows at $15$–$42\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; grows in $1\\%$ sodium chloride.\n- Original material is nearly exhausted, but components are culturable.\n- Prevailing usage of the name in the literature corresponds to organisms with the characteristics of component `A`.\n- Stated ICNP principles: a name is attached to its nomenclatural type (type strain); names are governed by priority and valid publication rules (including deposition); a neotype may be designated if the original type is unsuitable or cannot be unambiguously defined, following procedures involving the Judicial Commission (JC) of the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The scenario of a contaminated or mixed type strain is a known issue in historical microbiology. The analytical techniques cited (16S rRNA sequencing, WGS, $ANI$, $dDDH$) are standard methods in modern prokaryotic systematics. The specified $ANI$ and $dDDH$ values and their interpretation against accepted thresholds are correct. The stated principles of the ICNP are accurate summaries of the Code's rules. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient, consistent, and relevant information to determine a correct course of action under the ICNP. It is an objective problem directly related to microbial systematics, devoid of speculation or ambiguity. It is not trivial, as it requires detailed knowledge of nomenclatural rules and procedures.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe central issue is the nature of the nomenclatural type. According to the ICNP, the name of a species is permanently attached to its type strain. In this case, the type strain is a mixture of two distinct species, rendering it unsuitable as a stable and unambiguous point of reference. The primary goal of the ICNP in such cases is to promote nomenclatural stability while ensuring scientific accuracy. This means a solution should be sought that preserves the historical name, if possible, rather than discarding it.\n\n$1$. **Assessment of the Type Material**: The current type strain, being a mixture of two species from different genera ($ANI=86.4\\%$, $dDDH=28.7\\%$), is \"unsuitable\" for the purposes of nomenclature under the ICNP. A type must be a pure culture of a single prokaryotic taxon.\n\n$2$. **Fixing the Application of the Name**: To maintain nomenclatural stability, the widely used name from $1954$ should be conserved and its application fixed to one of the components. The evidence provided overwhelmingly supports choosing component `A`:\n    - Component `A` matches the phenotypic description in the original protologue (alginate use, temperature/salinity range).\n    - Prevailing usage of the name in the scientific literature refers to organisms with the properties of component `A`.\n    - Component `A` belongs to the same genus as originally described, whereas `B` does not.\nAttaching the name to component `A` causes the least disruption to the existing body of scientific work.\n\n$3$. **Formal Nomenclatural Action**: The ICNP provides a mechanism for replacing an unsuitable type. Rule 18 of the ICNP addresses this situation.\n    - **Lectotypification**: Rule 18a states, \"If a species was originally described from a culture which was not pure, a type may be chosen from the isolates which were obtained from this culture.\" Designating the purified culture of component `A` as the lectotype would be the most precise action, as it is selected from the original type material.\n    - **Neotypification**: If for any reason a lectotype cannot be designated (e.g., if the link to the original deposit is considered broken), Rule 18c allows for the designation of a neotype when the original type is \"for any reason no longer in existence\" or is deemed unsuitable. A purified culture of component `A` would be proposed as the neotype.\nIn either case, the outcome is the same: a pure culture of component `A` becomes the new nomenclatural type.\n\n$4$. **Procedural Requirements**: Such a significant nomenclatural act must follow strict procedures.\n    - The proposal for a lectotype or neotype, with all supporting evidence, must be validly published. For nomenclatural matters to be validly published, they must appear in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM).\n    - The new type strain (the pure culture of component `A`) must be deposited in at least two public service culture collections in different countries, and evidence of this deposition must be provided (Rule 30).\n    - An emended description of the species, based on the detailed characteristics of component `A` (including genomic data), must be published to accurately circumscribe the taxon to which the name now unambiguously applies.\n    - Because this is a complex case that corrects a long-standing error, it is subject to review. The ICNP allows for a period for objections to be filed. If objections arise, or to ensure a final and binding resolution, the matter may be submitted as a Request for an Opinion to the Judicial Commission of the ICSP.\n\n$5$. **Resolution of Component `B`**: Component `B` is a distinct species in a different genus that was a contaminant in the original type. Its taxonomic status must be resolved. A separate study is required to characterize it fully. Based on this study, it should either be identified as a member of a pre-existing species or, if it is novel, be formally described as a new species with its own name and type strain, following all ICNP rules for valid publication.\n\nThis comprehensive set of actions ensures scientific rigor, adheres to the established rules of nomenclature, and prioritizes the stability of the name in the scientific community.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Document the mixture with multiple independent lines of evidence; separate and purify components $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$; test against the protologue to identify which component best matches the original description and prevailing usage. Restrict the application of the existing name to the matching component by proposing, with full evidentiary support, the designation of a neotype (or the fixation of the purified derivative as the nomenclatural type if demonstrably traceable) for the species, ensuring deposition of the selected type in at least $2$ recognized public culture collections in different countries. Publish an emended species description and the neotype designation in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM), allowing for the period of objection and, if necessary, submitting a Request for an Opinion to the Judicial Commission to fix the application of the name. For the non-matching component, undertake a separate taxonomic study and either assign it to an existing species or validly publish it as a new species with its own type strain and deposition, clarifying any resulting heterotypic synonyms and new combinations.**\nThis option meticulously follows the logical and procedural steps derived above. It correctly identifies the need to prove the mixture, select the appropriate component based on evidence (protologue and usage), use the correct nomenclatural mechanism (lectotype/neotype), follow the ICNP rules for publication (IJSEM) and deposition, engage the Judicial Commission if needed, and taxonomically resolve the status of the second component. This is a complete and correct procedure.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because the original type strain material is a mixture, immediately suppress the historical name as invalid and coin two entirely new species names for components $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$, without reference to the protologue, without engaging the Judicial Commission, and without emending any descriptions or considering prevailing usage, thereby avoiding the complexity of neotype designation.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. A name validly published is not \"invalid\" just because its type is later found to be impure. Suppression of a name (*nomen rejiciendum*) is an extreme measure taken only by the Judicial Commission to resolve confusion, not a default action. This proposal violates the Principle of Priority and the goal of nomenclatural stability by discarding a widely used name. Creating two new names would cause maximum confusion in the literature.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Retain the mixed culture as the type to preserve historical continuity, but divide the species into two biovars corresponding to components $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$, each anchored by a separate reference genome. Keep the original mixed culture as the nomenclatural type while adding the two reference genomes as supplemental types, and publish the change in any peer-reviewed journal since the code does not require a specific venue.**\nThis option displays a profound misunderstanding of both nomenclature and taxonomy. A mixed culture cannot serve as a functional type because it is ambiguous. The rank of \"biovar\" has no formal standing and is wholly inappropriate for two organisms that are members of different species and genera. The ICNP recognizes one and only one nomenclatural type for a species; the concept of \"supplemental types\" in this context does not exist. Finally, nomenclatural proposals must be published in the IJSEM to be effective, not just any journal.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Choose the higher-quality genome assembly (either $\\mathrm{A}$ or $\\mathrm{B}$) as the sequence type and register the name under a genome-sequence code of nomenclature, thereby fixing the name by genome alone without the need for viable cultures, deposits in culture collections, or engagement with the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM) or the Judicial Commission, which are unnecessary if a genome is available.**\nThis option attempts to apply rules from a different, parallel system of nomenclature (the SeqCode) to a problem governed by the ICNP. The ICNP, under which the species was named, is based on type strains, which must be viable cultures deposited in collections. It does not recognize genome sequences alone as types for species with validly published names. Abandoning the ICNP framework and its procedural requirements (IJSEM, JC, deposition) is not a valid way to resolve a problem *within* the ICNP.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2512749"}, {"introduction": "Modern systematics is an inherently statistical science, where evolutionary relationships are inferred from molecular data using explicit models of sequence evolution.

Note that the BIC penalty for complexity, $k \\ln(n)$, is more severe than the AIC penalty, $2k$, when $\\ln(n)  2$, which is the case here as $\\ln(4200) \\approx 8.3428$.\n\nThe data provided are:\nSample size: $n = 4200$.\nThe natural logarithm of the sample size is $\\ln(4200) \\approx 8.3428$.\n\nFor Model $1$ (Poisson$+G$):\nMaximized log-likelihood $\\ln L_1 = -23350.2$.\nNumber of free parameters $k_1 = 1$.\n\nFor Model $2$ (JTT$+G$):\nMaximized log-likelihood $\\ln L_2 = -22045.7$.\nNumber of free parameters $k_2 = 1$.\n\nFor Model $3$ (WAG$+G+F$):\nMaximized log-likelihood $\\ln L_3 = -21880.4$.\nNumber of free parameters $k_3 = 20$.\n\nFor Model $4$ (LG$+G+I+F$):\nMaximized log-likelihood $\\ln L_4 = -21820.9$.\nNumber of free parameters $k_4 = 21$.\n\nWe now compute the AIC and BIC for each of the four models.\n\nModel $1$:\n$AIC_1 = 2k_1 - 2\\ln L_1 = 2(1) - 2(-23350.2) = 2 + 46700.4 = 46702.4$.\n$BIC_1 = k_1 \\ln(n) - 2\\ln L_1 \\approx 1(8.3428) - 2(-23350.2) = 8.3428 + 46700.4 = 46708.7428$.\n\nModel $2$:\n$AIC_2 = 2k_2 - 2\\ln L_2 = 2(1) - 2(-22045.7) = 2 + 44091.4 = 44093.4$.\n$BIC_2 = k_2 \\ln(n) - 2\\ln L_2 \\approx 1(8.3428) - 2(-22045.7) = 8.3428 + 44091.4 = 44099.7428$.\n\nModel $3$:\n$AIC_3 = 2k_3 - 2\\ln L_3 = 2(20) - 2(-21880.4) = 40 + 43760.8 = 43800.8$.\n$BIC_3 = k_3 \\ln(n) - 2\\ln L_3 \\approx 20(8.3428) - 2(-21880.4) = 166.856 + 43760.8 = 43927.656$.\n\nModel $4$:\n$AIC_4 = 2k_4 - 2\\ln L_4 = 2(21) - 2(-21820.9) = 42 + 43641.8 = 43683.8$.\n$BIC_4 = k_4 \\ln(n) - 2\\ln L_4 \\approx 21(8.3428) - 2(-21820.9) = 175.1988 + 43641.8 = 43816.9988$.\n\nSummarizing the results:\n- Model $1$: $AIC_1 = 46702.4$, $BIC_1 \\approx 46708.7$\n- Model $2$: $AIC_2 = 44093.4$, $BIC_2 \\approx 44099.7$\n- Model $3$: $AIC_3 = 43800.8$, $BIC_3 \\approx 43927.7$\n- Model $4$: $AIC_4 = 43683.8$, $BIC_4 \\approx 43817.0$\n\nThe problem specifies that selection must be based on the Bayesian Information Criterion. Comparing the BIC values, we seek the minimum value:\n$BIC_1 \\approx 46708.7$\n$BIC_2 \\approx 44099.7$\n$BIC_3 \\approx 43927.7$\n$BIC_4 \\approx 43817.0$\n\nThe minimum BIC value is approximately $43817.0$, which corresponds to Model $4$.\n\nThe justification for this selection lies in the trade-off analysis. As we move from simpler to more complex models (from Model $1$ to Model $4$), the log-likelihood consistently improves, indicating a better fit to the data. \n- Model $1$ (Poisson) is clearly inadequate, as its log-likelihood is substantially lower than others.\n- Model $2$ (JTT), an empirical model, provides a massive improvement over Poisson ($\\Delta \\ln L \\approx 1304.5$).\n- Model $3$ (WAG with empirical frequencies $+F$) further improves the fit over JTT by using frequencies estimated from the data, at the cost of $19$ additional parameters. The BIC for Model $3$ is lower than for Model $2$, justifying this increase in complexity.\n- The critical comparison is between Model $3$ and Model $4$. Model $4$ adds one parameter to Model $3$: the proportion of invariant sites ($+I$). This single parameter increases the log-likelihood by $\\Delta \\ln L = \\ln L_4 - \\ln L_3 = -21820.9 - (-21880.4) = 59.5$.\n\nTo determine if this improvement justifies the additional parameter under the BIC framework, we can examine the change in BIC:\n$\\Delta BIC = BIC_4 - BIC_3 = (k_4 - k_3) \\ln(n) - 2(\\ln L_4 - \\ln L_3)$\n$\\Delta BIC \\approx (21 - 20) \\times 8.3428 - 2(59.5) = 8.3428 - 119 = -110.6572$.\n\nSince $\\Delta BIC$ is substantially less than zero, the BIC strongly supports the inclusion of the additional parameter. The substantial improvement in model fit far outweighs the penalty for added complexity, even under the stringent BIC criterion. Therefore, Model $4$ (LG$+G+I+F$) represents the most parsimonious and best-fitting model for this dataset concerning the evolution of ribosomal proteins across the three domains of life. It explicitly accounts for site-specific rate heterogeneity with both a gamma distribution and a class of invariant sites, and it uses amino acid frequencies empirically derived from the data, which is crucial for deep evolutionary analyses.\n\nThe selected model is Model $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2512682"}]}
