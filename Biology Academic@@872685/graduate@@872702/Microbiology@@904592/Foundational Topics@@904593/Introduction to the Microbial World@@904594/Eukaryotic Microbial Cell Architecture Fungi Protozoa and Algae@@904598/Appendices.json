It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the scaling relationship between the characteristic time for diffusion and the length scale over which it occurs. The starting point, as correctly stated in the problem, is the fundamental relation for one-dimensional diffusion, which describes the mean-squared displacement, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, of a particle undergoing Brownian motion. This is the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation. For diffusion in a single dimension, this relation is precisely given by:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle = 2Dt\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $t$ is the elapsed time.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"characteristic time\" required for a metabolite to explore a certain distance $L$. A physically meaningful and standard definition for this characteristic time, which we shall denote as $t_{\\text{char}}$, is the time at which the root-mean-square (RMS) displacement is equal to the distance $L$. The RMS displacement is defined as $\\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle}$. Therefore, we set:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle} = L\n$$\nSquaring both sides of this equation yields:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle = L^2\n$$\nBy equating this with the Einstein relation, we can solve for the characteristic time, $t_{\\text{char}}$:\n$$\nL^2 = 2Dt_{\\text{char}}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{\\text{char}}$ gives the general expression for the characteristic diffusion time over a distance $L$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{char}} = \\frac{L^2}{2D}\n$$\nThis equation reveals a crucial principle: the characteristic time for diffusion scales with the square of the distance. This is a non-intuitive and fundamental result of the random walk nature of diffusion.\n\nWe are given two cases with different characteristic intracellular distances, $L_1$ and $L_2$, but the same diffusion coefficient $D$.\nFor the first case, a compact protozoan with distance $L_1 = 1\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, the characteristic equilibration time, $t_1$, is:\n$$\nt_1 = \\frac{L_1^2}{2D}\n$$\nFor the second case, a larger algal or fungal compartment with distance $L_2 = 10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, the characteristic equilibration time, $t_2$, is:\n$$\nt_2 = \\frac{L_2^2}{2D}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fold-increase $R$ in the characteristic diffusion time when the distance is increased from $L_1$ to $L_2$. This is simply the ratio of the two times, $R = \\frac{t_2}{t_1}$.\nWe can now compute this ratio using the expressions derived above:\n$$\nR = \\frac{t_2}{t_1} = \\frac{\\frac{L_2^2}{2D}}{\\frac{L_1^2}{2D}}\n$$\nThe terms $2D$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, which demonstrates that the final ratio is independent of both the diffusion coefficient and the specific constant of proportionality (which is $2$ for one-dimensional diffusion). This leaves a simple relationship based only on the length scales:\n$$\nR = \\frac{L_2^2}{L_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^2\n$$\nWe are given the values $L_1 = 1\\ \\mu\\text{m}$ and $L_2 = 10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$. Substituting these into our expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\left(\\frac{10\\ \\mu\\text{m}}{1\\ \\mu\\text{m}}\\right)^2 = (10)^2\n$$\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$\nR = 100\n$$\nThis means that increasing the characteristic distance by a factor of $10$ results in a $100$-fold increase in the time required for a metabolite to equilibrate via diffusion.

I will proceed with the full solution.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe task is to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{T_{\\text{diff}}}{T_{\\text{active}}}$, where $T_{\\text{diff}}$ is the mean first passage time for diffusion and $T_{\\text{active}}$ is the time for active transport.\n\nPart 1: Mean First Passage Time for Diffusion ($T_{\\text{diff}}$)\nThe dynamics of the mean first passage time (MFPT), $T(x)$, for a particle starting at position $x$ is governed by the backward Fokker-Planck equation. For a one-dimensional system with diffusion coefficient $D$ and no drift, this equation simplifies to:\n$$ D \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -1 $$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation for $T(x)$ on the domain $x \\in [0, L]$. To solve it, we must apply the specified boundary conditions.\n\n1.  Absorbing boundary at $x=L$: If the particle starts at the absorbing boundary, the time to be captured is zero. Therefore, $T(L) = 0$.\n2.  Reflecting boundary at $x=0$: A reflecting boundary implies zero flux. For the MFPT, this corresponds to a zero gradient. Therefore, $\\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0$.\n\nWe now solve the boundary value problem.\nFirst, integrate the differential equation with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{D} + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.\nApplying the reflecting boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx}(0) = -\\frac{0}{D} + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0 $$\nThe expression for the gradient simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{D} $$\nIntegrate a second time with respect to $x$:\n$$ T(x) = \\int \\left(-\\frac{x}{D}\\right) dx = -\\frac{x^2}{2D} + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration.\nApply the absorbing boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$ T(L) = -\\frac{L^2}{2D} + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{L^2}{2D} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the expression for $T(x)$ gives the general solution for the MFPT from any starting point $x$:\n$$ T(x) = \\frac{L^2 - x^2}{2D} $$\nThe problem states the protein is synthesized and released at $x=0$. Therefore, the specific mean first passage time we require is $T(0)$:\n$$ T_{\\text{diff}} = T(0) = \\frac{L^2 - 0^2}{2D} = \\frac{L^2}{2D} $$\n\nPart 2: Time for Active Transport ($T_{\\text{active}}$)\nThe active transport is modeled as movement with a constant speed $v$ over a distance $L$. This is a simple kinematic calculation. The time taken is:\n$$ T_{\\text{active}} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{L}{v} $$\n\nPart 3: The Ratio $R$\nThe final step is to compute the ratio $R$ of the two transport times.\n$$ R = \\frac{T_{\\text{diff}}}{T_{\\text{active}}} = \\frac{\\frac{L^2}{2D}}{\\frac{L}{v}} $$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$ R = \\frac{L^2}{2D} \\cdot \\frac{v}{L} = \\frac{Lv}{2D} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- $L = 100\\ \\mu\\text{m}$\n- $v = 1\\ \\mu\\text{m/s}$\n- $D = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$\n\n$$ R = \\frac{(100\\ \\mu\\text{m}) \\cdot (1\\ \\mu\\text{m/s})}{2 \\cdot (20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{100}{40} = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5 $$\nThe units are $(\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{m/s}) / (\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s})$, which correctly results in a dimensionless quantity.

First, a mechanical relationship between the internal pressure and the stress in the cell wall must be established. Second, a physicochemical relationship between the intracellular osmolarity and the osmotic pressure must be stated. Combining these two will yield the desired expression for the critical osmolarity.\n\nWe begin with the mechanical analysis of the cell wall, modeled as a thin spherical pressure vessel of radius $R$ and thickness $h$. The cell experiences a turgor pressure, $\\Delta P$, which is the difference between the internal and external pressures. This pressure creates a tensile stress in the wall. To find the relationship, we perform a force balance on a hemisphere of the cell. The force exerted by the pressure on the projected circular area of the hemisphere is $F_{pressure} = \\Delta P \\cdot (\\pi R^2)$. This force must be balanced by the total tensile force in the material of the wall along the equatorial cut, $F_{wall}$. This force is the product of the circumferential stress, $\\sigma$, and the cross-sectional area of the wall material, which for a thin shell is approximately $A_{wall} = 2 \\pi R h$. Thus, $F_{wall} = \\sigma \\cdot (2 \\pi R h)$.\n\nEquating the forces for mechanical equilibrium:\n$$F_{pressure} = F_{wall}$$\n$$\\Delta P (\\pi R^2) = \\sigma (2 \\pi R h)$$\nSolving for the circumferential stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta P R}{2 h}$$\nThe problem states that the wall fails when this stress reaches the ultimate tensile strength, $\\sigma_{c}$. Therefore, the critical pressure difference, $\\Delta P_{crit}$, that causes failure is related to $\\sigma_{c}$ by:\n$$\\sigma_{c} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{crit} R}{2 h}$$\nFrom which we can express the critical pressure:\n$$\\Delta P_{crit} = \\frac{2 h \\sigma_{c}}{R}$$\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between pressure and osmolarity. The osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, of an ideal dilute solution is given by the van 't Hoff equation:\n$$\\Pi = C R_{g} T$$\nwhere $C$ is the total osmolarity of the solution (in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ if using SI units for $R_g$), $R_g$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The turgor pressure, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the internal osmotic pressure, $\\Pi_{in}$, and the external osmotic pressure, $\\Pi_{out}$.\n$$\\Delta P = \\Pi_{in} - \\Pi_{out}$$\nThe problem states that the cell is transferred to a medium of negligible osmolarity, so we can set $\\Pi_{out} \\approx 0$. The intracellular osmolarity at the point of failure is the critical osmolarity, $C_{crit}$. The turgor pressure at this point is therefore:\n$$\\Delta P_{crit} = \\Pi_{in} = C_{crit} R_{g} T$$\n\nNow, we equate the mechanical and physicochemical expressions for the critical pressure $\\Delta P_{crit}$:\n$$C_{crit} R_{g} T = \\frac{2 h \\sigma_{c}}{R}$$\nSolving for the critical intracellular osmolarity, $C_{crit}$, gives the final derived expression:\n$$C_{crit} = \\frac{2 h \\sigma_{c}}{R R_{g} T}$$\n\nNow we compute the numerical value.
