## Introduction
MHC-mediated [antigen presentation](@entry_id:138578) is a cornerstone of [adaptive immunity](@entry_id:137519), serving as the critical surveillance system that allows T cells to detect and respond to infected or malignant cells. This process involves a series of intricate molecular steps that select representative peptide fragments from the vast cellular proteome and display them on the cell surface. Understanding how this selection occurs—deciphering the rules that govern which peptides are chosen and how they are loaded onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules—is fundamental to immunology. This article addresses the knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive overview of this elegant and complex system.

Across the following chapters, you will gain a deep understanding of this vital immune process. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** dissects the core molecular machinery, detailing the distinct MHC class I and class II pathways from gene to protein to peptide-MHC complex. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** explores the profound impact of these mechanisms on human health, linking MHC genetics to disease, host-pathogen conflicts, and the rational design of new therapies. Finally, **"Hands-On Practices"** will allow you to apply these concepts to solve quantitative problems in [immunoinformatics](@entry_id:167703) and [vaccine design](@entry_id:191068), solidifying your grasp of the material.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The adaptive immune system's capacity to recognize and eliminate pathogens or aberrant cells hinges on the presentation of antigenic peptides by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. This chapter delineates the core principles and molecular mechanisms that govern this intricate process, from the genetic blueprint encoding the presentation machinery to the biophysical rules that select which fragments of the proteome are ultimately displayed to T cells. We will dissect the two major pathways of [antigen presentation](@entry_id:138578)—the MHC class I pathway for endogenous antigens and the MHC class II pathway for [exogenous antigens](@entry_id:204790)—and explore the complex cellular machinery and regulatory checks that ensure their fidelity and efficiency.

### The Genetic Foundation: The Major Histocompatibility Complex Locus

The core components of the [antigen presentation](@entry_id:138578) system are encoded in a dense, polymorphic, and tightly linked cluster of genes known as the **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)**. In humans, this locus is called the **Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex** and resides on the short arm of chromosome 6. The genomic architecture of the HLA complex is a testament to the principle of functional co-localization, where genes whose products collaborate in a common pathway are physically grouped together. The human MHC is organized into three principal regions, which, from the telomeric to the centromeric end, are the Class I, Class III, and Class II regions [@problem_id:2507759].

The **Class I region** contains the classical, highly polymorphic genes `HLA-A`, `HLA-B`, and `HLA-C`. These genes encode the heavy chains of MHC class I molecules, which are responsible for presenting peptides from intracellular sources to CD8$^{+}$ cytotoxic T [lymphocytes](@entry_id:185166). This region also harbors genes for non-classical MHC class I molecules like `HLA-E`, `HLA-F`, and `HLA-G`, and MHC class I-related genes such as `MICA` and `MICB`, which play specialized roles, often in the context of natural killer (NK) [cell recognition](@entry_id:146097).

The **Class II region**, located at the centromeric end, is arguably the most striking example of functional clustering. It contains the genes for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains of the classical MHC class II molecules `HLA-DP`, `HLA-DQ`, and `HLA-DR`, which present peptides from extracellular sources to CD4$^{+}$ helper T cells. Remarkably, this region also houses a suite of genes essential for processing antigens for the *class I* pathway. These include `TAP1` and `TAP2`, which encode the two subunits of the **Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP)**, and `PSMB8` (LMP7) and `PSMB9` (LMP2), which encode catalytic subunits of the [immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772). Furthermore, it contains genes for molecules that regulate peptide loading onto class II molecules themselves, namely `HLA-DM` and `HLA-DO`. This co-localization ensures coordinate regulation and inheritance of these critical immune functions [@problem_id:2507759].

Sandwiched between these two regions is the **Class III region**. It is the most gene-dense segment of the MHC but does not encode peptide-presenting molecules. Instead, its products are functionally diverse, including components of the complement system (e.g., C2, C4, Factor B), inflammatory [cytokines](@entry_id:156485) such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), and other immune-related proteins.

### Structural Basis of Peptide Presentation: The MHC Molecules

The function of MHC molecules is dictated by their three-dimensional architecture. While both class I and class II molecules perform the same fundamental task of binding and presenting peptides, their structures are distinct, leading to different sources of peptides and interactions with different T cell subsets.

#### MHC Class I Molecules: A Closed System for Endogenous Peptides

An MHC class I molecule is a heterodimer composed of a long, polymorphic **heavy chain** encoded within the MHC and a smaller, non-polymorphic light chain called **$\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\beta_2$m)**, whose gene is located on a different chromosome (chromosome 15 in humans). The heavy chain folds into three extracellular domains: $\alpha1$, $\alpha2$, and $\alpha3$. The peptide-binding platform is formed by the juxtaposition of the $\alpha1$ and $\alpha2$ domains. This platform consists of a floor made of an eight-stranded anti-parallel $\beta$-sheet, flanked by two long, overarching $\alpha$-helices that form the walls of the [peptide-binding groove](@entry_id:198529) [@problem_id:2507756].

A defining feature of the class I groove is that its ends are **closed**. This structural constraint imposes a strict length limitation on the peptides that can bind, typically restricting them to 8 to 10 amino acids. From a biophysical perspective, this closure acts as a thermodynamic filter. The groove imposes a fixed [end-to-end distance](@entry_id:175986), $d$, on the bound peptide. A peptide that is too short must stretch to bridge this distance, incurring a severe entropic penalty. Conversely, a peptide that is too long cannot extend beyond the groove's ends and must bulge out, which is energetically unfavorable due to [steric hindrance](@entry_id:156748) and loss of stabilizing contacts. Thus, only peptides within a narrow length range can bind with high affinity by minimizing their Gibbs free energy [@problem_id:2507798]. The conserved pockets at the ends of the groove engage the N- and C-termini of the peptide, while internal pockets, known as anchor pockets, accommodate specific side chains (e.g., at positions P2 and P$\Omega$), dictating the [peptide binding motif](@entry_id:194869) for a given MHC allele.

The membrane-proximal $\alpha3$ domain adopts a stable immunoglobulin-like fold and serves as the docking site for the **CD8 co-receptor** on cytotoxic T cells. The non-covalent association with $\beta_2$m is indispensable; it provides [cooperative folding](@entry_id:162765) energy to stabilize the entire heavy chain, particularly the peptide-receptive conformation of the $\alpha1/\alpha2$ platform. In the absence of $\beta_2$m, the heavy chain is unstable and is retained and degraded in the [endoplasmic reticulum](@entry_id:142323). Therefore, stable cell-surface expression requires the formation of a [ternary complex](@entry_id:174329) of heavy chain, $\beta_2$m, and a high-affinity peptide [@problem_id:2507756].

#### MHC Class II Molecules: An Open Platform for Exogenous Peptides

In contrast, an MHC class II molecule is a heterodimer of two transmembrane chains, an **$\alpha$ chain** and a **$\beta$ chain**, both encoded within the MHC locus. Each chain has two extracellular domains: $\alpha1$ and $\alpha2$ for the $\alpha$ chain, and $\beta1$ and $\beta2$ for the $\beta$ chain. The [peptide-binding groove](@entry_id:198529) is formed by the pairing of the membrane-distal $\alpha1$ and $\beta1$ domains, which adopt a structure homologous to the class I platform: a $\beta$-sheet floor and two $\alpha$-helical walls [@problem_id:2507742].

The critical difference lies in the topology of the groove. The MHC class II groove is **open at both ends**. This lack of terminal capping structures removes the strict length constraint seen in MHC class I. Peptides bind in an extended conformation, anchored by interactions along the length of the groove, but their N- and C-terminal ends are free to extend beyond the groove's confines. This allows MHC class II molecules to accommodate a more heterogeneous pool of peptides, typically ranging from 13 to 25 amino acids in length, or even longer. Similar to class I, the membrane-proximal domains ($\alpha2$ and $\beta2$) have [immunoglobulin](@entry_id:203467)-like folds, and they contribute to the binding site for the **CD4 co-receptor** on helper T cells.

### The MHC Class I Pathway: Presentation of Endogenous Antigens

The class I pathway is a surveillance system for the internal state of a cell, displaying samples of proteins synthesized within the cytosol, such as viral proteins in an infected cell or mutated proteins in a cancer cell.

#### Peptide Generation: The Role of the Immunoproteasome

The first step is the degradation of cytosolic proteins into peptide fragments. This is primarily carried out by the **proteasome**, a large, multi-catalytic [protease](@entry_id:204646) complex. Under basal conditions, the **constitutive proteasome** performs this function. However, upon exposure to inflammatory cytokines like Interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$), cells upregulate the expression of alternative catalytic subunits: **LMP2 ($\beta1i$), MECL-1 ($\beta2i$), and LMP7 ($\beta5i$)**. These subunits replace their constitutive counterparts ($\beta1, \beta2, \beta5$) to form the **[immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772)** [@problem_id:2507792].

This substitution remodels the substrate-binding pockets of the catalytic sites, fundamentally altering the [proteasome](@entry_id:172113)'s cleavage preferences. Specifically, the [immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772) shows reduced caspase-like activity (cleavage after acidic residues) and enhanced [chymotrypsin](@entry_id:162618)-like (cleavage after hydrophobic residues) and trypsin-like (cleavage after basic residues) activities. This shift is critically important because most MHC class I alleles preferentially bind peptides with hydrophobic or basic C-terminal [anchor residues](@entry_id:204433). Thus, the [immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772) enriches the pool of cytosolic peptides for those that are optimal precursors for MHC class I loading. Additionally, IFN-$\gamma$ induces the **PA28 (11S) regulator**, which binds to the [proteasome](@entry_id:172113) core and increases the rate of substrate entry and product release, further enhancing the supply of appropriately sized peptides for the class I pathway [@problem_id:2507792].

#### Peptide Loading and Editing in the Endoplasmic Reticulum

Peptides generated in the cytosol must be transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where new MHC class I molecules are synthesized. This transport is mediated by **TAP**, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that pumps peptides across the ER membrane.

Inside the ER, the nascent, unstable MHC class I molecule is chaperoned and loaded with a peptide by a large, transient multi-[protein assembly](@entry_id:173563) known as the **Peptide-Loading Complex (PLC)** [@problem_id:2507768]. The PLC orchestrates a sophisticated quality control process. Its key components include:
*   **Calnexin and Calreticulin**: These are lectin chaperones that bind to N-linked glycans on the folding MHC I heavy chain, promoting its proper conformation and association with $\beta_2$m. Calnexin, a membrane protein, typically engages the heavy chain early, while [calreticulin](@entry_id:203302), a soluble protein, is part of the final PLC.
*   **ERp57**: A thiol oxidoreductase that associates with the lectin chaperones and forms a disulfide bond with [tapasin](@entry_id:192386), contributing to the structural integrity of the complex.
*   **Tapasin**: A dedicated chaperone that acts as the central scaffold of the PLC. It forms a physical bridge between the MHC class I molecule and the TAP transporter, positioning the empty MHC molecule to receive peptides.
*   **TAP**: The peptide transporter, which delivers the cargo of peptides from the cytosol.

Crucially, [tapasin](@entry_id:192386) is not merely a bridge; it is a **peptide editor**. It stabilizes the [peptide-binding groove](@entry_id:198529) of the MHC class I molecule in an open, receptive conformation, which paradoxically accelerates the dissociation of low-affinity peptides. This editing function is a form of **[kinetic proofreading](@entry_id:138778)** [@problem_id:2507740]. Tapasin does not consume ATP itself; rather, it acts as a catalyst, accelerating both the on-rate and off-rate of peptides. In the non-equilibrium environment of the ER, where stably folded peptide-MHC complexes are continuously removed for export to the cell surface (an irreversible "sink"), this catalysis has a profound effect. Complexes with low-affinity peptides (high $k_{\text{off}}$) are quickly disassembled by [tapasin](@entry_id:192386), allowing the MHC molecule to sample another peptide. In contrast, complexes with high-affinity peptides (low $k_{\text{off}}$) have a longer [residence time](@entry_id:177781) and are more likely to dissociate from [tapasin](@entry_id:192386) and be exported before their peptide dissociates. This elegant mechanism ensures that the cell surface is populated primarily with highly stable peptide-MHC I complexes, which are most effective at stimulating T cells, without requiring direct energy input for the editing step itself [@problem_id:2507740].

### The MHC Class II Pathway: Presentation of Exogenous Antigens

The class II pathway samples the extracellular environment, presenting peptides derived from proteins that have been internalized by [professional antigen-presenting cells](@entry_id:201215) (APCs), such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells.

#### Assembly, Trafficking, and the Invariant Chain

MHC class II $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains are synthesized and translocated into the ER, where they assemble. To prevent them from prematurely binding the abundant endogenous peptides destined for class I molecules, their groove is immediately occupied by a dedicated chaperone, the **[invariant chain](@entry_id:181395) (Ii)** [@problem_id:2507802]. Ii serves two critical functions. First, as a placeholder, it ensures that the class II groove is reserved for its proper cargo. Second, Ii contains sorting motifs in its cytosolic tail, most notably a dileucine-based motif. In the trans-Golgi network, this motif is recognized by the cellular sorting machinery, which diverts the MHC class II-Ii complex away from the default secretory pathway (to the plasma membrane) and targets it to the [endocytic pathway](@entry_id:183264). If this sorting signal is mutated, the MHC class II-Ii complex fails to be routed to endosomes and is instead transported directly to the cell surface, preventing its exposure to [exogenous antigens](@entry_id:204790) [@problem_id:2507802].

#### Peptide Loading and Editing in Endosomes

Within the progressively acidic environment of the endosomes and lysosomes, internalized antigens are degraded by proteases like cathepsins. Simultaneously, the Ii chain is sequentially cleaved, leaving a small remnant called the **Class II-associated Invariant chain Peptide (CLIP)** still bound in the MHC class II groove.

The release of CLIP and the loading of antigenic peptides is catalyzed by a non-classical MHC class II-like molecule called **HLA-DM** in humans [@problem_id:2507813]. HLA-DM acts as a peptide editor, analogous to [tapasin](@entry_id:192386) in the class I pathway. It binds to the MHC class II molecule, induces a conformational change, and lowers the activation energy for the dissociation of CLIP and other weakly bound peptides. This opens the groove, allowing it to sample the peptide repertoire present in the endosome. By selectively accelerating the off-rate of low-stability peptides, HLA-DM ensures that the MHC class II molecules that reach the cell surface are predominantly loaded with high-affinity, stably bound peptides. This catalytic process is pH-dependent, being most active in the acidic milieu of late endosomes.

In certain cell types, particularly B cells and thymic epithelial cells, the activity of HLA-DM is modulated by another molecule, **HLA-DO**. HLA-DO binds to HLA-DM and acts as a pH-dependent inhibitor. At the milder pH of early endosomes, HLA-DO strongly inhibits HLA-DM, preventing premature [peptide editing](@entry_id:187762). As the endosome acidifies, this inhibition is relieved, allowing robust HLA-DM-mediated editing to occur in the late endosomal compartments where the peptide concentration is highest. This regulatory layer provides a mechanism to fine-tune [antigen presentation](@entry_id:138578) in specific cellular contexts [@problem_id:2507813].

### Exceptions and Complexities: Cross-Presentation

While the segregation of endogenous antigens to class I and [exogenous antigens](@entry_id:204790) to class II is a central paradigm, a critical exception exists. Certain [dendritic cells](@entry_id:172287) possess the ability to take up [exogenous antigens](@entry_id:204790) and present them on MHC class I molecules to CD8$^{+}$ T cells, a process known as **[cross-presentation](@entry_id:152512)**. This is vital for initiating cytotoxic T cell responses against viruses that do not infect APCs or against tumors. Two main pathways for [cross-presentation](@entry_id:152512) have been described [@problem_id:2507805].

The **cytosolic pathway** involves the [translocation](@entry_id:145848) of internalized antigen from the [phagosome](@entry_id:192839) or endosome into the cytosol. This export process appears to co-opt machinery related to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, such as the Sec61 [translocon](@entry_id:176480) and the p97/VCP AAA-ATPase. Once in the cytosol, the antigen is processed by the [proteasome](@entry_id:172113) and its peptides are transported by TAP into the ER for loading onto MHC class I molecules, following the conventional pathway. This route is therefore sensitive to inhibitors of the [proteasome](@entry_id:172113), TAP, Sec61, and p97.

The **vacuolar pathway** is a TAP- and proteasome-independent route. In this model, the internalized antigen is degraded by endosomal proteases like cathepsins. MHC class I molecules are then recruited from an intracellular reservoir to these endosomal/phagosomal compartments, where they are loaded with the generated peptides. This pathway is sensitive to inhibitors of endosomal acidification (like bafilomycin A1) and endosomal proteases but is resistant to proteasome or TAP inhibitors. Trimming of peptides in this compartment can be performed by aminopeptidases such as Insulin-Regulated Aminopeptidase (IRAP) [@problem_id:2507805].

### Synthesis: The Determinants of Immunodominance

When the immune system encounters a complex pathogen, the resulting T cell response is not uniformly distributed against all possible [epitopes](@entry_id:175897). Instead, it is highly focused on a small subset of peptides, creating a hierarchy of **[immunodominance](@entry_id:152449)**. This hierarchy is not random but is the cumulative outcome of the multi-step biochemical filter that is the [antigen processing and presentation](@entry_id:178409) pathway [@problem_id:2507769].

Each step in the pathway contributes to the final density of a given peptide-MHC complex on the cell surface, which in turn dictates the magnitude of the T cell response. For **MHC class I presentation**, the key determinants include:
1.  **Source Protein Abundance**: More abundant proteins yield more peptide precursors.
2.  **Proteasomal Processing**: The efficiency and specificity of the [immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772) in liberating a particular peptide from its parent protein.
3.  **TAP Transport**: The affinity of a peptide for the TAP transporter determines its efficiency of entry into the ER.
4.  **ER Trimming**: The activity of ER aminopeptidases can either create or destroy an epitope.
5.  **MHC Binding and Editing**: The intrinsic affinity and [kinetic stability](@entry_id:150175) of the peptide for the MHC class I molecule, which is tested and selected through [tapasin](@entry_id:192386)-mediated editing.

For **MHC class II presentation**, an analogous series of filters applies:
1.  **Antigen Abundance**: The amount of antigen internalized into endosomes.
2.  **Endosomal Processing**: The efficiency of cleavage by endo-lysosomal proteases to generate a particular peptide.
3.  **MHC Binding and Editing**: The competitive ability of a peptide to bind MHC class II in the face of HLA-DM-mediated editing.

Ultimately, [immunodominance](@entry_id:152449) is a quantitative, systems-level property that emerges from the complex interplay of protein expression, enzymatic processing, [intracellular transport](@entry_id:171096), and the fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular competition.
