Before proceeding to a solution, it is mandatory to validate the problem statement for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity.\n\nThe givens are extracted verbatim as follows:\n1.

Assumption: All $\\mathrm{O_2^-}$ produced undergoes the specified dismutation reaction.\n7.  Assumption: No other side reactions or sinks exist.\n8.  The task is to determine two quantities: the moles of $\\mathrm{O_2^-}$ produced per mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$ consumed, and the moles of $\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ ultimately formed per mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$ consumed.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The role of NADPH oxidase, the function of NADPH as a two-electron donor, and the reactions for superoxide generation and its subsequent dismutation to hydrogen peroxide are fundamental and well-established concepts in biochemistry and immunology. The assumptions provided serve to create an idealized, closed system, which is a standard and valid approach for a problem of this nature, allowing for a focused analysis of the core stoichiometry. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution is derived by tracking the flow of electrons from the initial donor ($\\mathrm{NADPH}$) to the final stable product ($\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$) via the intermediate ($\\mathrm{O_2^-}$). Let us consider the consumption of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the moles of superoxide ($\\mathrm{O_2^-}$) produced.\nAccording to the problem statement, the oxidation of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$ yields $2$ moles of electrons.\n$$\nn_{e^-} = 2 \\times n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}\n$$\nThese electrons are used to reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide. The stoichiometry for this reaction is given as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{O_2} + e^- \\to \\mathrm{O_2^-}\n$$\nThis reaction shows a $1:1$ molar ratio between electrons consumed and superoxide anions produced. Therefore, the moles of $\\mathrm{O_2^-}$ formed, $n_{\\mathrm{O_2^-}}$, must equal the moles of electrons liberated from $\\mathrm{NADPH}$.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{O_2^-}} = n_{e^-} = 2 \\times n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}\n$$\nThe first quantity to be determined is the ratio of moles of $\\mathrm{O_2^-}$ produced per mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$ consumed.\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{O_2^-}}}{n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}} = \\frac{2 \\times n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}}{n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}} = 2\n$$\nThus, for every $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$ consumed, $2$ moles of $\\mathrm{O_2^-}$ are generated.\n\nSecond, we determine the moles of hydrogen peroxide ($\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$) formed.\nThe problem states that all of the generated superoxide undergoes quantitative dismutation according to the reaction:\n$$\n2\\,\\mathrm{O_2^-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H^+} \\to \\mathrm{H_2O_2} + \\mathrm{O_2}\n$$\nFrom the stoichiometry of this reaction, $2$ moles of $\\mathrm{O_2^-}$ produce $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$. This gives a stoichiometric ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{H_2O_2}}}{n_{\\mathrm{O_2^-}}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the moles of $\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ produced, $n_{\\mathrm{H_2O_2}}$, can be expressed in terms of the moles of $\\mathrm{O_2^-}$ consumed:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H_2O_2}} = \\frac{1}{2} n_{\\mathrm{O_2^-}}\n$$\nWe have already established that $n_{\\mathrm{O_2^-}} = 2 \\times n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $n_{\\mathrm{H_2O_2}}$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H_2O_2}} = \\frac{1}{2} (2 \\times n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}) = n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}\n$$\nThe second quantity to be determined is the ratio of moles of $\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ formed per mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$ consumed.\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{H_2O_2}}}{n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}}{n_{\\mathrm{NADPH}}} = 1\n$$\nThus, for every $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$ consumed, $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ is ultimately formed.\n\nThe two calculated stoichiometric yields are $2$ for superoxide and $1$ for hydrogen peroxide. The question requires the answer as a two-entry row vector $\\big[ n_{\\mathrm{O_2^-}},\\, n_{\\mathrm{H_2O_2}} \\big]$, where each entry represents the moles of product per mole of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$.

Consider activation of the Alternative Pathway (AP) of the Complement System (CS) on its outer membrane. In the AP, C3b binds Factor B (FB) to form C3bB, which is cleaved by Factor D (FD), a serine protease, to form the surface-bound C3 convertase C3bBb. Properdin (factor P) stabilizes C3bBb, increasing its half-life. C3bBb cleaves C3 to generate more C3b, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies surface opsonization and can drive formation of the C5 convertase C3bBbC3b and subsequent Membrane Attack Complex (MAC).\n\nA patient carries a point mutation in FD that decreases its catalytic efficiency for cleaving C3bB.

Assume that the rate of C3bBb formation on the bacterial surface is approximately proportional to $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$ for FD and to the concentrations of FD and C3bB, while the loss of C3bBb is governed by a first-order decay with effective rate constant $k_{\\text{decay}}$ that includes dissociation and inactivation.\n\nBased on these constraints and starting from the definitions of catalytic efficiency and positive feedback amplification, which prediction best describes the effect of the FD mutation on AP amplification on the bacterial surface?\n\nA.

The loss of C3bBb is governed by a first-order decay with an effective rate constant $k_{\\text{decay}}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The description of the Alternative Pathway, its components (C3, FB, FD, P), its regulation (FH, FI), and its mechanism (tickover, amplification loop, convertase formation) is factually correct and consistent with established principles of immunology. The concept of catalytic efficiency ($k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$) is a cornerstone of enzyme kinetics. The scenario of a partial loss-of-function mutation in a complement factor is clinically relevant and biologically plausible.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It defines a specific perturbation (reduced FD efficiency) within a defined system (AP on a non-self surface) and asks for a qualitative prediction of the outcome. The provided assumptions are sufficient to construct a logical, qualitative model of the system's dynamics.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and scientific language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, logically consistent, and well-posed. It is a valid problem for analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the Alternative Pathway's function is the amplification loop. We can model the dynamics of the surface-bound C3 convertase, C3bBb. Let its surface concentration be $[C3bBb]$. The rate of change of $[C3bBb]$ is the difference between its rate of formation and its rate of decay.\n\n$$ \\frac{d[C3bBb]}{dt} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{formation}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{decay}} $$\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n1.  The rate of formation is proportional to the catalytic efficiency of FD, $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M)_{\\text{FD}}$, and the concentrations of the enzyme, $[FD]$, and the substrate, $[C3bB]$.\n    $$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{formation}} = k_{1} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M} \\right)_{\\text{FD}} [FD][C3bB] $$\n    where $k_{1}$ is a proportionality constant. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics for this step, $v = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E][S]}{K_M + [S]}$, simplify to $v \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}[E][S]$ when the substrate concentration $[S]$ is much smaller than $K_M$. This is a valid assumption for the early stages of complement activation, making the reaction rate directly proportional to the catalytic efficiency.\n\n2.  The rate of decay is a first-order process.\n    $$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{decay}} = k_{\\text{decay}}[C3bBb] $$\n    The constant $k_{\\text{decay}}$ accounts for both intrinsic dissociation of the C3bBb complex and proteolytic inactivation by factors like FI. Since the bacterium cannot recruit FH, the FI-mediated inactivation is limited to what can occur without this cofactor, and properdin acts to decrease $k_{\\text{decay}}$.\n\nThe full rate equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d[C3bBb]}{dt} = k_{1} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M} \\right)_{\\text{FD}} [FD][C3bB] - k_{\\text{decay}}[C3bBb] $$\n\nThe positive feedback arises because $[C3bBb]$ generates C3b, which in turn generates the substrate $[C3bB]$. The rate of C3b generation is:\n$$ \\frac{d[C3b]_{\\text{new}}}{dt} = k_{\\text{amp}}[C3bBb][C3] $$\nThis new C3b quickly binds FB to form C3bB, thus $[C3bB]$ is dependent on the amount of active convertase, $[C3bBb]$. A higher $[C3bBb]$ leads to a higher $[C3bB]$, which in turn fuels a higher rate of $[C3bBb]$ formation, provided the FD enzyme is efficient.\n\nThe mutation reduces $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M)_{\\text{FD}}$ by a factor of $5$. This directly impacts the formation rate of C3bBb. Let's compare the normal (WT) and mutant (MUT) systems.\n$$ (\\text{Rate}_{\\text{formation}})_{\\text{MUT}} = k_{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_{\\text{WT}} \\right) [FD][C3bB] = \\frac{1}{5} (\\text{Rate}_{\\text{formation}})_{\\text{WT}} $$\n\nThe efficiency of converting the substrate C3bB into the active enzyme C3bBb is severely compromised. This acts as a bottleneck in the positive feedback loop. Even if C3bBb cleaves C3 to C3b effectively, the subsequent conversion of the resulting C3bB into new C3bBb is five times slower. Consequently, the amplification cannot \"take off\" with the same vigor as in the normal system.\n\nAt steady state ($\\frac{d[C3bBb]}{dt} = 0$), the rates of formation and decay are equal:\n$$ k_{1} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M} \\right)_{\\text{FD}} [FD][C3bB]_{\\text{ss}} = k_{\\text{decay}}[C3bBb]_{\\text{ss}} $$\n$$ [C3bBb]_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{k_{1} [FD]}{k_{\\text{decay}}} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M} \\right)_{\\text{FD}} [C3bB]_{\\text{ss}} $$\n\nBecause $[C3bB]_{\\text{ss}}$ itself is generated by the action of $[C3bBb]_{\\text{ss}}$, we see a system where a reduction in $(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M)_{\\text{FD}}$ will lead to a lower self-sustaining steady state. The system will equilibrate at a much lower density of $[C3bBb]_{\\text{ss}}$ and, consequently, a lower density of total deposited C3b.\n\nLower C3b density leads directly to reduced opsonization for phagocytosis (opsonophagocytosis).\nLower C3b and C3bBb density reduces the probability of forming the C5 convertase, C3bBbC3b. This, in turn, reduces C5 cleavage and subsequent MAC formation.\n\nTherefore, the mutation leads to attenuated positive feedback, resulting in lower steady-state levels of C3 convertase and C3b on the bacterial surface, with diminished downstream effector functions.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. A lower steady-state density of C3b and C3bBb on the bacterial surface, attenuated positive feedback, and consequently reduced opsonophagocytosis and MAC deposition.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement accurately reflects the consequences derived from first principles. A 5-fold reduction in the catalytic efficiency of FD, a critical enzyme in the amplification loop, directly weakens the positive feedback. This leads to a lower equilibrium concentration of the convertase (C3bBb) and its product (C3b). The downstream consequences—reduced opsonization and MAC formation—are correctly inferred.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. No significant change in amplification because properdin stabilizes existing C3 convertase and the classical and lectin pathways fully compensate on naive bacterial surfaces.**\n- **Analysis:** This option is flawed. Properdin's stabilization of C3bBb affects its decay rate ($k_{\\text{decay}}$), but it cannot compensate for a drastic 5-fold reduction in the formation rate. The steady-state level depends on the ratio of formation to decay. Furthermore, the problem is explicitly about the Alternative Pathway. Invoking compensation from other pathways is speculative and ignores the focus of the question. The classical pathway requires specific antibodies, which are not guaranteed to be present, and \"full compensation\" is a very strong, unsubstantiated claim.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Increased amplification because slower cleavage of FB allows C3bB to accumulate, producing a burst of C3 convertase formation that offsets the reduced catalytic efficiency.**\n- **Analysis:** This reasoning is kinetically unsound. The rate of product formation is limited by the enzyme's efficiency, not just the availability of substrate. Accumulating substrate (C3bB) does not make a slow enzyme work faster. The overall flux through the C3bB $\\rightarrow$ C3bBb step is reduced, which means the rate of amplification is reduced. There is no physical basis for a \"burst\" that would offset the catalytic defect; rather, the system's response will be slower and weaker.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A selective defect in AP initiation (tickover) but near-normal amplification once any C3 convertase forms, because FD activity is not rate-limiting for sustained C3 cleavage on bacterial surfaces.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement contains two errors. First, the defect is not selective to initiation. FD is essential for both fluid-phase initiation (cleaving C3(H$_2$O)B) and surface amplification (cleaving C3bB). The impact on amplification is arguably more significant. Second, the claim that FD activity is not rate-limiting for amplification is false. The conversion of C3bB to C3bBb is the very step that constitutes the positive feedback. Making this step less efficient directly makes it more rate-limiting for the amplification cycle. Therefore, amplification cannot be \"near-normal.\"\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2502642"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical models to practical measurement is a key skill in immunology.

The premises are factually sound, and the task is a direct application of data analysis techniques common in biological sciences. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as specified by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we compute the fraction of hemolysis, $h$, for each serum dilution. The governing equation is\n$$\nh = \\frac{\\mathrm{OD}_{\\text{sample}} - \\mathrm{OD}_{0}}{\\mathrm{OD}_{100} - \\mathrm{OD}_{0}}\n$$\nGiven the control values $\\mathrm{OD}_{0} = 0.060$ and $\\mathrm{OD}_{100} = 0.980$, the denominator is a constant:\n$$\n\\mathrm{OD}_{100} - \\mathrm{OD}_{0} = 0.980 - 0.060 = 0.920\n$$\nWe now calculate $h$ for each sample OD at its corresponding reciprocal dilution $D$:\n- For $D = 4$, $\\mathrm{OD} = 0.906$:\n  $h = \\frac{0.906 - 0.060}{0.920} = \\frac{0.846}{0.920} \\approx 0.9196$\n- For $D = 8$, $\\mathrm{OD} = 0.704$:\n  $h = \\frac{0.704 - 0.060}{0.920} = \\frac{0.644}{0.920} = 0.700$\n- For $D = 16$, $\\mathrm{OD} = 0.428$:\n  $h = \\frac{0.428 - 0.060}{0.920} = \\frac{0.368}{0.920} = 0.400$\n- For $D = 32$, $\\mathrm{OD} = 0.244$:\n  $h = \\frac{0.244 - 0.060}{0.920} = \\frac{0.184}{0.920} = 0.200$\n- For $D = 64$, $\\mathrm{OD} = 0.152$:\n  $h = \\frac{0.152 - 0.060}{0.920} = \\frac{0.092}{0.920} = 0.100$\n\nSecond, we determine the reciprocal dilution $D_{50}$ that corresponds to $50\\%$ lysis ($h = 0.5$). From the calculated values, we see that $h = 0.5$ is bracketed by the results for $D = 8$ ($h = 0.7$) and $D = 16$ ($h = 0.4$). The problem states to assume a linear relationship between $h$ and $\\log_{10}(D)$ in this range.\nLet $y = h$ and $x = \\log_{10}(D)$.

The CH50 value is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\text{CH50 (U/mL)} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot D}{V}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the reciprocal dilution yielding $50\\%$ lysis ($D_{50}$) and $V$ is the volume of diluted serum in $\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. We are given $V = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ and we have calculated $D_{50} = 2^{11/3}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\text{CH50} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 2^{11/3}}{100} = 10 \\cdot 2^{11/3}\n$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we calculate the value of this expression:\n$$\n2^{11/3} = 2^{3.666...} \\approx 12.699208\n$$\n$$\n\\text{CH50} \\approx 10 \\cdot 12.699208 = 126.99208\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $9$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\text{CH50} \\approx 127.0\n$$\nThe trailing zero is significant and must be included to indicate precision to four figures. The final answer is $127.0$ CH50 units per milliliter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{127.0}$$", "id": "2502590"}]}
