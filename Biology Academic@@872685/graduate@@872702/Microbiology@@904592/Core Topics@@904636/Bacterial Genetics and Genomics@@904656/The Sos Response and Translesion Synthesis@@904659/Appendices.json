Consider a promoter with a single SOS box site. LexA binds DNA as a pre-formed dimer. Let the free concentration of LexA dimer be denoted by $L$, and the dissociation constant for dimer binding to the SOS box be denoted by $K_d$, defined by the equilibrium relation $K_d = \\frac{[D][L]}{[DL]}$, where $[D]$ is the concentration of unbound promoter and $[DL]$ is the concentration of promoter bound by the LexA dimer.

In other words, transcription occurs only from the unbound state, and the intrinsic transcriptional capacity of the unbound promoter is unchanged by LexA.\n\nExpress both $f_{\\text{bound}}$ and $F$ as simplified analytic functions of $K_d$ and $L$. Report your final answer as dimensionless expressions. No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard equilibrium binding model for gene repression, a fundamental concept in molecular biophysics. All necessary assumptions and definitions are provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is valid. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system considers the reversible binding of a LexA dimer, $L$, to a single DNA operator site, the SOS box, denoted as $D$. The binding reaction is:\n$$D + L \\rightleftharpoons DL$$\nwhere $DL$ is the complex of the LexA dimer bound to the DNA.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is given by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[D][L]}{[DL]}$$\nHere, $[D]$ is the concentration of free, unbound promoter sites, $[L]$ is the concentration of free LexA dimers, and $[DL]$ is the concentration of promoter sites bound by LexA. The problem states that $[L]$ can be treated as a constant, which we denote simply as $L$. Thus,\n$$K_d = \\frac{[D]L}{[DL]}$$\n\nThe first objective is to find the fractional occupancy, $f_{\\text{bound}}$. This is defined as the fraction of total promoter sites that are bound by the repressor at any given time.\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of bound sites}}{\\text{Total concentration of sites}}$$\nLet the total concentration of promoter sites be $[D]_{\\text{total}}$. The total number of sites is the sum of the unbound sites and the bound sites:\n$$[D]_{\\text{total}} = [D] + [DL]$$\nTherefore, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[DL]}{[D] + [DL]}$$\nTo express this in terms of $L$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate the concentration terms $[D]$ and $[DL]$. We can do this by using the equilibrium relationship. From the definition of $K_d$, we can express $[D]$ in terms of $[DL]$:\n$$[D] = \\frac{K_d [DL]}{L}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[D]$ into the equation for $f_{\\text{bound}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[DL]}{\\left( \\frac{K_d [DL]}{L} \\right) + [DL]}$$\nThe term $[DL]$ appears in the numerator and in each term of the denominator, so it can be factored out and canceled:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[DL] \\cdot 1}{[DL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{L} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{L} + 1}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $L$:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d + L}{L}} = \\frac{L}{K_d + L}$$\nThis is the final expression for the fractional occupancy. It is a dimensionless quantity, as required.\n\nThe second objective is to derive the transcription fold-change, $F$. This is defined as the ratio of the basal transcription rate (in the presence of LexA) to the transcription rate in the fully unrepressed limit (no LexA).\n$$F = \\frac{R_{\\text{basal}}}{R_{\\text{unrepressed}}}$$\nThe problem states that transcription occurs *only* from the unbound state of the promoter. Therefore, the transcription rate must be proportional to the concentration of unbound promoters, $[D]$. Let $k_{txn}$ be the intrinsic rate constant of transcription from an unbound promoter.\n$$R_{\\text{basal}} = k_{txn} [D]$$\nIn the fully unrepressed limit, there is no LexA, so all promoter sites are unbound. The concentration of available promoters is the total concentration, $[D]_{\\text{total}}$. The maximum possible transcription rate is thus:\n$$R_{\\text{unrepressed}} = k_{txn} [D]_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{k_{txn} [D]}{k_{txn} [D]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[D]}{[D]_{\\text{total}}}$$\nThis ratio, $\\frac{[D]}{[D]_{\\text{total}}}$, is precisely the fraction of promoters that are *unbound*, which we can denote as $f_{\\text{unbound}}$.\n$$F = f_{\\text{unbound}}$$\nThe sum of the fraction of bound sites and the fraction of unbound sites must be equal to $1$:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} + f_{\\text{unbound}} = 1$$\nTherefore, we can express $F$ in terms of the fractional occupancy $f_{\\text{bound}}$ which we have already derived:\n$$F = 1 - f_{\\text{bound}}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $f_{\\text{bound}}$:\n$$F = 1 - \\frac{L}{K_d + L}$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$F = \\frac{K_d + L}{K_d + L} - \\frac{L}{K_d + L} = \\frac{(K_d + L) - L}{K_d + L}$$\n$$F = \\frac{K_d}{K_d + L}$$\nThis is the final expression for the fold-change.

The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt} = -k[L]\n$$\nWith the initial condition $[L](t=0) = [L]_0$, integration yields the concentration of active LexA as a function of time:\n$$\n[L](t) = [L]_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta_i$, of the operator site for a given promoter $P_i$ is described by the single-site mass-action binding model, also known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single site:\n$$\n\\theta_i = \\frac{[L](t)}{[L](t) + K_{d,i}}\n$$\nwhere $K_{d,i}$ is the promoter-specific dissociation constant.\n\nThe problem defines \"$50\\%$ derepression\" as the state where half of the operator sites are unoccupied. The fraction of unoccupied sites is $1 - \\theta_i$. Therefore, at the time $t_{50,i}$, we have:\n$$\n1 - \\theta_i(t_{50,i}) = 0.5\n$$\nThis implies that the fractional occupancy $\\theta_i$ must be $0.5$:\n$$\n\\theta_i(t_{50,i}) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n$$\nWe substitute this condition into the binding equation to find the required LexA concentration, which we denote $[L]_{50,i}$:\n$$\n0.5 = \\frac{[L]_{50,i}}{[L]_{50,i} + K_{d,i}}\n$$\nSolving for $[L]_{50,i}$:\n$$\n0.5 \\left( [L]_{50,i} + K_{d,i} \\right) = [L]_{50,i}\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K_{d,i} = 0.5 [L]_{50,i}\n$$\n$$\n[L]_{50,i} = K_{d,i}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the definition of the dissociation constant $K_d$ as the ligand concentration that yields half-maximal occupancy.

It is scientifically grounded in the well-understood principles of the SOS response in *Escherichia coli*, is self-contained, and poses a well-defined question that can be answered through logical deduction from the provided information and established principles of molecular genetics.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving the expected phenotype for each mutant strain based on the provided principles and comparing these predictions to the options. The wild-type response serves as the baseline.\n\nIn a wild-type cell, ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces DNA lesions that stall replication. This generates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which binds the RecA protein. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), this forms an activated nucleoprotein filament, RecA*. RecA* has two critical co-protease functions: 1) it stimulates the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor, leading to the derepression of the SOS regulon genes, and 2) it promotes the proteolytic processing of the UmuD protein to its active form, UmuD'. The induction of the SOS response increases the cellular levels of proteins involved in DNA repair, such as those for nucleotide excision repair (NER), and translesion synthesis (TLS). The primary TLS polymerase for bypassing UV lesions is DNA polymerase V (Pol V), a complex of $UmuD'_2C$. RecA* also acts as an accessory factor to activate Pol V at the lesion site. This bypass is error-prone and is the main source of UV-induced mutagenesis. The combined action of enhanced NER and TLS by Pol V ensures substantial cell survival, albeit at the cost of increased mutation frequency.\n\nWe now analyze each genetic variant:\n\n1.  Strain `` `lexA(Ind⁻)` ``: This strain expresses a non-cleavable LexA repressor. Consequently, even in the presence of DNA damage and abundant RecA* filaments, the SOS regulon remains repressed.\n    -   Survival: The cells are unable to induce the expression of SOS genes, including key NER genes and, critically, the `umuDC` operon encoding Pol V. Without the ability to upregulate repair or to bypass the UV lesions, replication forks remain stalled, leading to replication collapse, double-strand breaks, and cell death. Therefore, survival will be low.\n    -   Mutagenesis: UV-induced mutagenesis is primarily mediated by Pol V. Since the `umuDC` genes are not induced, there is an insufficient amount of Pol V to perform TLS. Thus, UV-induced mutagenesis will be very low or absent.\n\n2.  Strain `` `recA(G108A)` ``: This allele specifies a RecA protein with \"markedly reduced co-protease activity\" but intact homologous recombination activity.\n    -   Survival: The reduced co-protease function means this RecA variant is deficient in stimulating both LexA cleavage and UmuD processing. The failure to cleave LexA prevents efficient SOS induction, similar to the `` `lexA(Ind⁻)` `` strain. The failure to process UmuD to UmuD' prevents the formation of active Pol V. The result is a severe defect in TLS. Stalled replication forks will lead to cell death. The retained recombination activity might help repair some of the resulting double-strand breaks, providing a marginal survival advantage over a strain completely lacking any SOS or recombination function, but overall survival will still be low compared to wild-type. The description \"intermediate to low\" is appropriate.\n    -   Mutagenesis: The lack of UmuD processing means no active Pol V can be formed. Without Pol V, there is no mechanism for error-prone bypass of UV lesions. Therefore, UV-induced mutagenesis will be very low.\n\n3.  Strain `` `umuC` knockout ``: This strain has a deletion of the `umuC` gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of Pol V.\n    -   Survival: The rest of the SOS system is functional. Upon UV irradiation, LexA is cleaved and the SOS regulon is induced. This includes NER genes. However, the cell cannot produce functional Pol V. According to principle (c), Pol V is the principal TLS polymerase for UV lesions. Without it, replication forks that encounter lesions that have not been repaired by NER will remain stalled. The inability to bypass lesions will lead to a significant decrease in viability compared to wild-type. Therefore, survival will be reduced.\n    -   Mutagenesis: Since Pol V is the primary source of errors during the bypass of UV lesions, its absence will eliminate this pathway of mutagenesis. Thus, UV-induced mutagenesis will be very low or abolished.\n\n4.  Strain `` `dinB` overexpression ``: This strain constitutively overexpresses DinB, which is DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV).\n    -   Survival: According to principle (d), Pol IV is inefficient at bypassing UV photoproducts. Therefore, its overexpression will not provide an effective alternative bypass pathway. The overproduced Pol IV might compete with the replicative polymerase (Pol III) or with the dedicated UV-lesion bypass polymerase (Pol V), or non-productively bind to stalled forks, potentially interfering with proper repair. This would lead to survival that is unchanged or even slightly decreased compared to wild-type.\n    -   Mutagenesis: Pol IV is an inherently error-prone polymerase. Overexpressing it increases the overall mutation frequency, likely by gaining access to the replication fork more often and introducing errors. The cellular environment after UV damage, with an active SOS response and many stalled forks, provides ample opportunity for the excess, error-prone Pol IV to act, leading to a higher overall mutation rate. Thus, mutagenesis is predicted to be increased.\n\nOption-by-Option Analysis:\n\nA. The predictions for all four strains are consistent with our analysis.\n- `` `lexA(Ind⁻)` ``: Low survival and low mutagenesis due to lack of SOS induction.
