Consider an ensemble of long RecA filaments on ssDNA at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, where nucleation is rare relative to extension so that changes in filament length are dominated by monomer addition and loss at the two filament ends. Use the following fundamental base:\n- Chemical kinetics under mass action: a bimolecular association step at an end has a rate $r_{\\text{on}} = k_{\\text{on}} c$, where $k_{\\text{on}}$ is an association rate constant and $c$ is the free monomer concentration; a first-order dissociation step has a rate $r_{\\text{off}} = k_{\\text{off}}$, where $k_{\\text{off}}$ is a dissociation rate constant.\n- The instantaneous net change in filament length (in subunits per unit time) is the sum of net addition rates at the two ends.\n- The critical concentration $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is defined as the free monomer concentration $c$ at which the net change in filament length is zero.\n\nAt $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, single-molecule measurements of end kinetics for RecA filament extension on ssDNA in ATP yield the following rate constants for the two polar ends:\n- For the $+$ end: $k_{\\text{on}}^{+} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}^{+} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- For the $-$ end: $k_{\\text{on}}^{-} = 0.50 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}^{-} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n1.

We may proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and computation of the critical concentration, $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$.\n\nThe problem defines the kinetics of monomer addition and loss at the two distinct ends of a RecA filament, denoted as the $+$ end and the $-$ end. According to the principle of mass action kinetics provided, the rates of association ($r_{\\text{on}}$) and dissociation ($r_{\\text{off}}$) at each end depend on the free monomer concentration, $c$, and the respective rate constants.\n\nThe net rate of change of filament length, measured in subunits per unit time, at the $+$ end is the difference between the association rate and the dissociation rate at that end. Let this net rate be $J^{+}$.\n$$J^{+} = r_{\\text{on}}^{+} - r_{\\text{off}}^{+} = k_{\\text{on}}^{+}c - k_{\\text{off}}^{+}$$\nSimilarly, the net rate of change at the $-$ end, $J^{-}$, is:\n$$J^{-} = r_{\\text{on}}^{-} - r_{\\text{off}}^{-} = k_{\\text{on}}^{-}c - k_{\\text{off}}^{-}$$\n\nThe total instantaneous net change in filament length, $J_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the net rates at both ends, assuming both ends are exposed and active.\n$$J_{\\text{total}}(c) = J^{+} + J^{-} = (k_{\\text{on}}^{+}c - k_{\\text{off}}^{+}) + (k_{\\text{on}}^{-}c - k_{\\text{off}}^{-})$$\nWe can group terms by their dependence on the concentration $c$:\n$$J_{\\text{total}}(c) = (k_{\\text{on}}^{+} + k_{\\text{on}}^{-})c - (k_{\\text{off}}^{+} + k_{\\text{off}}^{-})$$\nThe critical concentration, $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$, is defined as the specific concentration $c$ at which the net change in filament length is zero, i.e., $J_{\\text{total}}(c_{\\mathrm{c}}) = 0$. This represents the equilibrium condition where, on average, the filament length does not change because total monomer addition is balanced by total monomer dissociation.\nSetting the expression for $J_{\\text{total}}$ to zero, we solve for $c = c_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$0 = (k_{\\text{on}}^{+} + k_{\\text{on}}^{-})c_{\\mathrm{c}} - (k_{\\text{off}}^{+} + k_{\\text{off}}^{-})$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ yields the formal expression:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{+} + k_{\\text{off}}^{-}}{k_{\\text{on}}^{+} + k_{\\text{on}}^{-}}$$\nThis is the required expression for the critical concentration for a filament with two distinct, active ends.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ using the provided rate constants at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- $k_{\\text{on}}^{+} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{off}}^{+} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{on}}^{-} = 0.50 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{off}}^{-} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{0.30\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) + (0.50 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}$$\n$$c_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{0.40\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.50 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.16 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\nAs requested, we express this intermediate result in micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), where $1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n$$c_{\\mathrm{c}} = 0.16\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nPart 2: Effect of RecFOR mediator proteins.\n\nThe mediator proteins RecFOR modify the kinetic rate constants.

A lower $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ signifies that net polymerization can be achieved at a lower concentration of free monomers, thus favoring filament assembly. The RecFOR mediator complex influences the kinetics to promote assembly. It does so by:\n1.  Increasing the association rate constants ($k_{\\text{on}}^{+}$ and $k_{\\text{on}}^{-}$). This increases the denominator of the $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ expression, thereby lowering its value. Mechanistically, this means that at any given monomer concentration, RecA monomers add to the filament ends more rapidly.\n2.  Decreasing the dissociation rate constants ($k_{\\text{off}}^{+}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}^{-}$). This decreases the numerator of the $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ expression, which also lowers its value. Mechanistically, monomers that have bound to the filament ends are less likely to dissociate, making the filament more stable.\n\nBoth of these effects, accelerating monomer addition and decelerating monomer loss, act synergistically to lower the threshold concentration of free RecA required for net filament growth. The calculation confirms this, as the fold-change $f$ is less than $1$, indicating a significant drop in the critical concentration in the presence of RecFOR.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.492}$$", "id": "2500232"}, {"introduction": "The active RecA filament is a remarkable molecular machine with two distinct jobs: catalyzing DNA strand exchange and activating the SOS DNA damage response by acting as a coprotease. This practice challenges you to think like a molecular geneticist and devise how to experimentally separate these two functions. By analyzing an experiment using separation-of-function alleles [@problem_id:2500183], you will learn to predict complex cellular phenotypes from specific molecular defects, bridging the gap between protein structure and biological function.", "problem": "You are investigating how the bacterial recombinase RecA separates its roles in homologous recombination from its role as a coprotease that stimulates autocleavage of the SOS repressor LexA and the DNA polymerase V subunit UmuD. You have an Escherichia coli strain with a deletion of the recA gene, and you can complement with plasmids expressing RecA variants. Use fundamental definitions: RecA binds single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form an active filament (commonly denoted RecA*) that catalyzes homologous pairing and strand exchange by capturing a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) partner. The same RecA* stimulates autocleavage of LexA, derepressing the SOS regulon, and promotes UmuD to UmuD′ processing that enables translesion synthesis. The dsDNA capture during strand exchange is mediated by a distinct secondary DNA-binding interface, often called site II, whereas ssDNA binding during filament formation is mediated by site I.\n\nYou must design an experiment that decouples the recombination function from the coprotease function and predict the resulting cellular phenotypes. The assays available are: a transcriptional SOS reporter (a PsulA-lacZ fusion for beta-galactosidase activity or a PrecA-green fluorescent protein reporter), a conjugational recombination or P1 transduction assay for homologous recombination frequency, an ultraviolet irradiation survival curve, an immunoblot detecting UmuD to UmuD′ processing, and microscopy to assess SulA-dependent filamentation. You can express RecA variants from native-strength promoters on low-copy plasmids. Choose the option that both proposes a sound design for separation-of-function and provides correct, mechanistically justified predictions for each genotype across the assays.\n\nA. Complement the recA deletion with four plasmids: wild-type RecA; a site II mutant that disrupts dsDNA capture but retains ssDNA filament formation (RecA-siteII); a surface-interface mutant that specifically abolishes LexA and UmuD engagement without perturbing strand exchange (RecA-LexAint); and empty vector. Predictions: wild-type shows robust SOS induction after DNA damage (reporter increases by approximately $10$–$20$-fold), high homologous recombination frequency, efficient UmuD′ production, SulA-dependent filamentation after ultraviolet irradiation, and the highest survival. RecA-siteII shows strong SOS induction and UmuD′ production comparable to wild-type after damage (because RecA* still forms on ssDNA), but exhibits a markedly reduced recombination frequency and poor survival similar to the vector under recombinational stress; cells filament due to SOS induction. RecA-LexAint shows near wild-type recombination frequency and survival that is intermediate (benefiting from recombination but lacking inducible SOS), minimal SOS reporter induction and no UmuD′ production, and no SulA-dependent filamentation. Empty vector shows no SOS induction, no recombination, no UmuD′, no filamentation, and extreme sensitivity.\n\nB. Complement with wild-type RecA; an ATPase-dead Walker A mutant that cannot bind ATP (RecA-ATP0); a C-terminal truncation that enhances DNA binding (RecA-ΔC); and empty vector. Predictions: RecA-ATP0 supports normal LexA and UmuD cleavage because ssDNA binding is sufficient, but cannot carry out recombination; RecA-ΔC is recombination-deficient yet SOS-constitutive due to hyperstabilized filaments; wild-type and vector behave as in option A.\n\nC. Complement with wild-type RecA and empty vector in cells carrying either a non-cleavable LexA allele (lexA Ind⁻) or a constitutively active LexA allele (lexA Ind⁺). Predictions: in lexA Ind⁻, SOS never induces so coprotease is functionally absent while recombination proceeds normally; in lexA Ind⁺, SOS is high constitutively and recombination is elevated independent of RecA filament status.\n\nD. Complement with wild-type RecA; a mutant in site I that weakens ssDNA binding (RecA-siteIweak); and a mutant that impairs interaction with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) (RecA-SSBint). Predictions: RecA-siteIweak retains coprotease function because RecA can assemble on dsDNA instead, but loses recombination; RecA-SSBint is recombination-proficient but coprotease-deficient because SSB displacement is only needed for recombination, not for LexA cleavage.\n\nWhich option is most appropriate? Select one.", "solution": "The problem requires designing an experiment to decouple the two primary functions of the *Escherichia coli* RecA protein: its role in homologous recombination and its role as a coprotease in the SOS response. The design must involve complementing a `recA` deletion strain with plasmids expressing various RecA mutants. The task is to select the option that proposes a sound experimental design and provides correct, mechanistically justified predictions for the resulting cellular phenotypes.\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n*   **Organism:** *Escherichia coli* strain with a deletion of the `recA` gene (`ΔrecA`).\n*   **Methodology:** Complementation with plasmids expressing RecA variants from native-strength promoters on low-copy plasmids.\n*   **RecA Function Definitions:**\n    *   RecA binds single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form an active filament, RecA*.\n    *   The RecA* filament catalyzes homologous recombination by capturing a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) partner. The dsDNA capture depends on a secondary DNA-binding interface, \"site II\".\n    *   The RecA* filament catalyzes autocleavage of the LexA repressor (inducing the SOS response) and the UmuD protein (to form UmuD′, required for translesion synthesis). This is the coprotease function.\n    *   The primary ssDNA binding during filament formation occurs at \"site I\".\n*   **Available Assays:**\n    *   SOS transcriptional reporter (e.g., `PsulA-lacZ`).\n    *   Homologous recombination frequency assay (conjugation or transduction).\n    *   Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation survival curve.\n    *   Immunoblot for UmuD to UmuD′ processing.\n    *   Microscopy for SulA-dependent filamentation (a consequence of SOS induction).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement describes a classic problem in molecular genetics: the dissection of a protein with multiple functions using separation-of-function mutations.\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of RecA biology, including its dependence on ssDNA and ATP for filament formation (RecA*), its dual roles in recombination and SOS coprotease activity, the existence of distinct DNA binding sites (site I and site II), and the nature of the SOS response (LexA cleavage, UmuD processing, SulA expression) are all factually correct and represent canonical knowledge in the field of bacterial DNA repair and recombination.\n*   **Well-Posed and Objective:** The goal is clearly stated. The definitions provided are precise and standard. The available assays are appropriate for measuring the predicted outcomes. The problem is objective and requires application of established principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-constructed question that tests fundamental understanding of molecular mechanisms. I will proceed to analyze the proposed options.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\nThe central premise for decoupling the functions is that the active RecA* filament (RecA-ssDNA-ATP) is the necessary intermediate for *both* recombination and coprotease activity. To separate the functions, a mutation must affect a step *downstream* of RecA* formation that is specific to one function but not the other.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\n*   **Experimental Design:** This option proposes a set of four strains: `ΔrecA` complemented with empty vector (negative control), wild-type `recA` (positive control), `recA-siteII` (mutant defective in dsDNA capture), and `recA-LexAint` (mutant defective in protein-protein interaction with LexA/UmuD). This is an excellent design. The two mutant forms are archetypal separation-of-function alleles.\n    *   The `recA-siteII` mutant is designed to be **recombination-deficient but coprotease-proficient**. It should form a normal RecA* filament but fail to engage the dsDNA partner for strand exchange.\n    *   The `recA-LexAint` mutant is designed to be **recombination-proficient but coprotease-deficient**. It should execute strand exchange but fail to stimulate cleavage of LexA and UmuD.\n*   **Prediction Analysis:**\n    *   **Wild-type `RecA`:** Predictions are correct. It is the baseline for full activity in all assays. The predicted $10$–$20$-fold SOS induction is a realistic value.\n    *   **`RecA-siteII`:** The prediction is that it shows strong SOS induction and UmuD′ processing but has very low recombination frequency. This is mechanistically correct. Formation of the RecA* filament on ssDNA from UV damage is sufficient for coprotease activity. The lack of dsDNA capture (site II function) specifically abrogates recombination. The resulting phenotype of poor survival is also correct, as homologous recombination is a major DNA repair pathway. SulA-dependent filamentation is a direct, correct consequence of SOS induction.\n    *   **`RecA-LexAint`:** The prediction is that it shows near wild-type recombination frequency but minimal SOS induction and no UmuD′ production. This is also mechanistically correct. The core strand exchange machinery is intact, allowing for recombination. The specific defect in the coprotease interface prevents SOS induction. The resulting \"intermediate\" survival is a logical consequence: the cell benefits from recombination repair but lacks the benefits of the full SOS response (e.g., translesion synthesis via UmuD'). The absence of SOS induction correctly predicts no SulA-dependent filamentation.\n    *   **Empty vector:** Predictions are correct. The `ΔrecA` null strain is deficient in all RecA-dependent activities.\n*   **Verdict for A:** This option proposes a sound experimental design with mechanistically correct and consistent predictions. It successfully decouples the two functions using specific alleles. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\n*   **Experimental Design:** Proposes using an ATPase-dead Walker A mutant (`RecA-ATP0`) and a C-terminal truncation (`RecA-ΔC`).\n*   **Prediction Analysis:** The prediction for `RecA-ATP0` is that it \"supports normal LexA and UmuD cleavage because ssDNA binding is sufficient\". This is fundamentally **incorrect**. The binding of ATP to RecA monomers is an absolute requirement for the conformational change that allows stable polymerization on ssDNA to form the active RecA* filament. A mutant that cannot bind ATP (`RecA-ATP0`) is catalytically dead for *both* recombination and coprotease activity. The premise is flawed.\n*   **Verdict for B:** This option is based on a critical scientific error regarding the role of ATP binding. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\n*   **Experimental Design:** This manipulates the host genetic background (`lexA` alleles) rather than using `recA` variants to probe RecA function. This does not address the core task of designing an experiment to decouple the *functions of the RecA protein itself*.\n*   **Prediction Analysis:** The prediction for the `lexA Ind⁺` background that \"recombination is elevated independent of RecA filament status\" is **incorrect**. Homologous recombination is absolutely dependent on the formation of an active RecA filament to perform strand search and exchange. The status of the SOS system does not bypass this requirement.\n*   **Verdict for C:** The experimental design deviates from the stated goal, and it includes a fundamentally incorrect prediction. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\n*   **Experimental Design:** Proposes a site I weak-binding mutant (`RecA-siteIweak`) and a mutant that impairs interaction with single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) (`RecA-SSBint`).\n*   **Prediction Analysis:**\n    *   The prediction for `RecA-siteIweak` is that it \"retains coprotease function because RecA can assemble on dsDNA instead\". This is **incorrect**. The active state for coprotease function is the ssDNA-bound filament. RecA binding to dsDNA does not produce this active conformation and does not trigger SOS induction. A defect in site I (ssDNA binding) would compromise the formation of the RecA* filament and thus impair *both* recombination and coprotease activity.\n    *   The prediction for `RecA-SSBint` is that it is \"coprotease-deficient because SSB displacement is only needed for recombination\". This is also **incorrect**. In vivo, ssDNA gaps and tails are coated by SSB. RecA must displace SSB to form a filament. This process is necessary to generate the RecA* filament, which is required for both recombination and coprotease activity. Therefore, a defect in the RecA-SSB interaction would negatively affect both functions.\n*   **Verdict for D:** This option contains multiple predictions based on flawed molecular reasoning. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A provides the only correct and complete answer. It proposes an elegant experimental design using precise separation-of-function mutants and accurately predicts the outcomes for all assays based on established molecular principles. The chosen mutants (`RecA-siteII` and `RecA-LexAint`) correctly isolate and separate the two key downstream activities of the RecA* filament.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2500183"}, {"introduction": "Homologous recombination is a powerful engine for evolution, but its activity between non-identical DNA sequences is policed by the cell's quality-control machinery.
