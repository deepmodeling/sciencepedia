It describes a standard biochemical redox reaction fundamental to chemolithotrophy. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with its solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the balanced chemical equation for the complete oxidation of thiosulfate ($S_2O_3^{2-}$) to sulfate ($SO_4^{2-}$) by molecular oxygen ($O_2$) in an acidic medium and to determine the number of electrons transferred per mole of thiosulfate. We will use the half-reaction method, which relies on the principles of mass and charge conservation.\n\nFirst, we establish the two half-reactions: the oxidation of thiosulfate and the reduction of oxygen.\n\n**1. Oxidation Half-Reaction**\n\nThe oxidation of thiosulfate ($S_2O_3^{2-}$) yields sulfate ($SO_4^{2-}$).\n$$\nS_2O_3^{2-} \\rightarrow SO_4^{2-}\n$$\nTo balance this half-reaction, we follow a systematic procedure:\n\na. Balance atoms other than oxygen ($O$) and hydrogen ($H$). In this case, we balance the sulfur ($S$) atoms. There are $2$ sulfur atoms on the left, so we require $2$ molecules of sulfate on the right.\n$$\nS_2O_3^{2-} \\rightarrow 2SO_4^{2-}\n$$\n\nb. Balance the oxygen atoms by adding water ($H_2O$) molecules. The left side has $3$ oxygen atoms, and the right side has $2 \\times 4 = 8$ oxygen atoms. We add $5$ molecules of $H_2O$ to the left side to balance the oxygen.\n$$\n5H_2O + S_2O_3^{2-} \\rightarrow 2SO_4^{2-}\n$$\n\nc. Balance the hydrogen atoms by adding hydrogen ions ($H^+$), as the reaction occurs in an acidic solution. The left side has $5 \\times 2 = 10$ hydrogen atoms. We add $10$ hydrogen ions to the right side.\n$$\n5H_2O + S_2O_3^{2-} \\rightarrow 2SO_4^{2-} + 10H^+\n$$\n\nd. Balance the net charge by adding electrons ($e^-$). The total charge on the left side is $-2$. The total charge on the right side is $2(-2) + 10(+1) = -4 + 10 = +6$. To equalize the charge, we must add $8$ electrons to the right side, as $(+6) + (-8) = -2$.\n$$\n5H_2O + S_2O_3^{2-} \\rightarrow 2SO_4^{2-} + 10H^+ + 8e^-\n$$\nThis is the balanced oxidation half-reaction. It explicitly shows that for each mole of thiosulfate oxidized, $8$ moles of electrons are released. This number is the quantity we are asked to find.\n\nFor completeness, we also balance the reduction half-reaction and derive the full equation.\n\n**2. Reduction Half-Reaction**\n\nMolecular oxygen ($O_2$) is reduced to water ($H_2O$).\n$$\nO_2 \\rightarrow H_2O\n$$\na. Balance oxygen atoms. We place a coefficient of $2$ in front of $H_2O$.\n$$\nO_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O\n$$\nb. Balance hydrogen atoms using $H^+$. There are $4$ hydrogen atoms on the right, so we add $4$ $H^+$ ions to the left.\n$$\n4H^+ + O_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O\n$$\nc. Balance the net charge using electrons ($e^-$). The charge on the left is $+4$, and on the right is $0$. We add $4$ electrons to the left side.\n$$\n4H^+ + O_2 + 4e^- \\rightarrow 2H_2O\n$$\nThis is the balanced reduction half-reaction.\n\n**3. Combining the Half-Reactions**\n\nThe oxidation half-reaction produces $8$ electrons, while the reduction half-reaction consumes $4$ electrons. To balance the electron transfer, we must multiply the reduction half-reaction by a factor of $2$.\n$$\n2 \\times (4H^+ + O_2 + 4e^- \\rightarrow 2H_2O) \\implies 8H^+ + 2O_2 + 8e^- \\rightarrow 4H_2O\n$$\nNow, we add the balanced oxidation half-reaction and the scaled reduction half-reaction:\n$$\n(5H_2O + S_2O_3^{2-}) + (8H^+ + 2O_2 + 8e^-) \\rightarrow (2SO_4^{2-} + 10H^+) + (4H_2O) + 8e^-\n$$\nWe cancel species that appear on both sides of the equation: $8e^-$, $8H^+$, and $4H_2O$.\n$$\nS_2O_3^{2-} + 2O_2 + H_2O \\rightarrow 2SO_4^{2-} + 2H^+\n$$\nThis is the fully balanced overall reaction for the complete oxidation of thiosulfate in an acidic environment. The equation is balanced for mass (S: $2$, O: $8$, H: $2$) and charge ($-2$).\n\n**4. Determination of Electrons Transferred**\n\nThe question asks for the number of electrons transferred to $O_2$ per mole of thiosulfate oxidized. As derived from the balanced oxidation half-reaction:\n$$\n5H_2O + S_2O_3^{2-} \\rightarrow 2SO_4^{2-} + 10H^+ + 8e^-\n$$\nThe stoichiometry clearly indicates that the oxidation of $1$ mole of $S_2O_3^{2-}$ releases exactly $8$ moles of electrons. These are the electrons that are subsequently accepted by the terminal electron acceptor, $O_2$.\n\nThis result can be verified by analyzing the change in oxidation states. In $S_2O_3^{2-}$, the average oxidation state of a sulfur atom is $+2$. In $SO_4^{2-}$, the oxidation state of the sulfur atom is $+6$. For one molecule of $S_2O_3^{2-}$, two sulfur atoms are oxidized from an average state of $+2$ to a state of $+6$. The total change in oxidation number is $2 \\times ((+6) - (+2)) = 2 \\times 4 = 8$. Thus, $8$ electrons are transferred per molecule (or mole) of thiosulfate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8}\n$$", "id": "2483398"}, {"introduction": "The energy available to a chemolithotroph is not a fixed value but is dictated by the specific environmental conditions of its niche.
