{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding any biosynthetic pathway begins with a fundamental accounting of its energetic and material costs. This practice invites you to deconstruct the assembly of the lipopolysaccharide anchor, Kdo$_2$-lipid A, and tally the precise consumption of high-energy molecules like $ATP$ and $UTP$. By working through the established enzymatic steps of the Raetz pathway [@problem_id:2504610], you will develop a rigorous, first-principles understanding of the metabolic investment required to build this essential component of the Gram-negative outer membrane.", "problem": "A lipopolysaccharide lipid A molecule in enteric bacteria is assembled by the Raetz pathway, beginning from uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and proceeding through a series of acyltransfer, deacetylation, glycosyltransfer, phosphorylation, and keto-deoxyoctulosonate (Kdo) transfer steps to produce Kdo$_2$-lipid A. Starting from the following well-established biochemical facts, derive the net stoichiometry of uridine triphosphate (UTP) consumption, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption, and pyrophosphate ($PP_i$) release required to synthesize exactly one molecule of Kdo$_2$-lipid A. Your derivation must be based on first principles of enzyme mechanism and mass balance, not on any precompiled stoichiometry.\n\nUse only the following as your fundamental base:\n- Uridyltransferase (GlmU) converts N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate to UDP-GlcNAc using UTP and releases $PP_i$; glycosyl donors activated as UDP-sugars are formed via this reaction class. \n- The early Raetz enzymes LpxA and LpxD are acyltransferases that use acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) thioesters and do not consume ATP or UTP; LpxC is a deacetylase with no nucleotide hydrolysis; LpxH (or the functional equivalent LpxI/LpxG) hydrolyzes the pyrophosphate linkage of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to produce lipid X and uridine monophosphate (UMP), with no ATP or UTP consumption; LpxB is a glycosyltransferase that uses a UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine donor to form the disaccharide-1-phosphate and releases UMP, with no ATP or UTP consumption.\n- LpxK is an ATP-dependent kinase that phosphorylates the disaccharide-1-phosphate at the $4^{\\prime}$-position, hydrolyzing ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$).\n- Kdo transferase (WaaA/KdtA) transfers exactly $2$ Kdo residues to the lipid A disaccharide backbone, using cytidine monophosphate-activated Kdo (CMP-Kdo) as the donor; CMP-Kdo is formed by CMP-Kdo synthetase (KdsB) from Kdo and cytidine triphosphate (CTP), releasing $PP_i$; Kdo transfer releases CMP, not $PP_i$.\n- Late acyltransferases (for example, LpxL and LpxM) use acyl-ACP donors and do not consume ATP or UTP.\n\nAssumptions and boundaries:\n- Count only direct UTP and ATP hydrolyses within the pathway and the formation of the requisite activated sugar nucleotides (UDP-GlcNAc and CMP-Kdo). Exclude the energetic costs of central carbon metabolism, amino sugar formation, fatty acid biosynthesis, and any salvage or recycling steps.\n- Exactly $2$ glucosamine units (each originating from UDP-GlcNAc) constitute the lipid A disaccharide backbone, and exactly $2$ Kdo residues are installed to obtain Kdo$_2$-lipid A.\n- Ignore any regulatory or accessory phosphorylation events beyond the single LpxK-catalyzed phosphorylation required to produce the diphosphoryl lipid A backbone prior to Kdo addition.\n\nTask: Derive the total counts of UTP molecules consumed, ATP molecules consumed, and $PP_i$ molecules released to produce exactly $1$ molecule of Kdo$_2$-lipid A. Express your final answer as a row matrix $\\left( \\text{UTP}, \\text{ATP}, \\mathrm{PP_i} \\right)$ using integers. No units. No rounding is necessary, and none should be performed.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the net stoichiometry for the consumption of uridine triphosphate ($UTP$) and adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$), and the release of pyrophosphate ($PP_{i}$), for the synthesis of one molecule of Kdo$_2$-Lipid A from its precursors, following the Raetz pathway. The derivation will be performed by systematically analyzing the energetic costs associated with the assembly of the constituent parts of the target molecule, based on the provided enzymatic reaction data.\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the final molecule, Kdo$_2$-Lipid A, into its fundamental building blocks as specified by the problem. It consists of a diglucosamine backbone, which is phosphorylated, and to which two keto-deoxyoctulosonate ($Kdo$) residues are attached. We will account for the nucleotide and pyrophosphate budget for each stage of assembly.\n\n1.  **Synthesis of the Diglucosamine Backbone Precursors**\n    The lipid A disaccharide backbone is composed of two glucosamine units. The problem states that each of these units originates from uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine ($UDP-GlcNAc$). Therefore, the synthesis of one molecule of the disaccharide requires two molecules of $UDP-GlcNAc$.\n    The formation of $UDP-GlcNAc$ is catalyzed by the uridyltransferase $GlmU$ according to the reaction:\n    $$N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate + UTP \\rightarrow UDP-GlcNAc + PP_{i}$$\n    For each molecule of $UDP-GlcNAc$ synthesized, one molecule of $UTP$ is consumed and one molecule of $PP_{i}$ is released. To provide the two glucosamine units for the lipid A backbone, this reaction must occur twice.\n    The costs for this stage are therefore:\n    - $UTP$ consumed: $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n    - $ATP$ consumed: $0$\n    - $PP_{i}$ released: $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n\n    The subsequent enzymatic steps in the early Raetz pathway ($LpxA$, $LpxC$, $LpxD$, $LpxH$, $LpxB$) are responsible for acylating, deacetylating, and joining the two glucosamine units. The problem explicitly states that $LpxA$, $LpxC$, and $LpxD$ do not consume $ATP$ or $UTP$. The enzymes $LpxH$ and $LpxB$ mediate the release of the uridine nucleotide carrier as uridine monophosphate ($UMP$), not as part of a cycle of $UTP$ consumption or $PP_{i}$ release germane to this accounting. Thus, these steps contribute no net cost to our tally.\n\n2.  **Phosphorylation of the Disaccharide Backbone**\n    After the disaccharide is formed, it is phosphorylated at the $4^{\\prime}$-position by the kinase $LpxK$. A kinase is an enzyme that transfers a phosphate group from a high-energy phosphate-donating molecule, typically $ATP$, to a specific substrate. The reaction is given as an $ATP$-dependent phosphorylation:\n    $$disaccharide-1-phosphate + ATP \\rightarrow disaccharide-1,4^{\\prime}-bisphosphate + ADP + P_{i}$$\n    This reaction hydrolyzes one molecule of $ATP$ to adenosine diphosphate ($ADP$) and inorganic phosphate ($P_{i}$). It does not produce pyrophosphate ($PP_{i}$). For the synthesis of one molecule of lipid A, this phosphorylation event occurs once.\n    The costs for this stage are:\n    - $UTP$ consumed: $0$\n    - $ATP$ consumed: $1$\n    - $PP_{i}$ released: $0$\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Transfer of Kdo Residues**\n    The final product, Kdo$_2$-Lipid A, contains two $Kdo$ residues. These are transferred from an activated sugar donor, cytidine monophosphate-activated $Kdo$ ($CMP-Kdo$). Therefore, two molecules of $CMP-Kdo$ are required.\n    The synthesis of $CMP-Kdo$ is catalyzed by $CMP-Kdo$ synthetase ($KdsB$). The reaction is:\n    $$Kdo + CTP \\rightarrow CMP-Kdo + PP_{i}$$\n    For each molecule of $CMP-Kdo$ formed, one molecule of cytidine triphosphate ($CTP$) is consumed and one molecule of $PP_{i}$ is released. To provide the two $Kdo$ residues, this reaction must occur twice.\n    The costs for activating the two $Kdo$ residues are:\n    - $CTP$ consumed: $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n    - $PP_{i}$ released: $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n\n    The problem requires accounting for $UTP$ and $ATP$ consumption only. The boundary condition states, \"Count only direct $UTP$ and $ATP$ hydrolyses\". The $KdsB$ reaction directly consumes $CTP$, not $UTP$ or $ATP$. While $CTP$ is synthesized from $UTP$ in the cell, this upstream process is part of nucleotide metabolism, which the problem boundaries explicitly exclude. Therefore, the consumption of $2$ $CTP$ does not add to the tally of $UTP$ or $ATP$. However, the problem *does* require accounting for all $PP_{i}$ released. The $KdsB$ reaction is a source of $PP_{i}$, so its contribution must be included.\n    The transferase step itself, catalyzed by $WaaA$, uses $CMP-Kdo$ as a donor and releases $CMP$. This reaction does not involve $UTP$, $ATP$, or $PP_{i}$.\n    The costs for this stage relevant to our tally are:\n    - $UTP$ consumed: $0$\n    - $ATP$ consumed: $0$\n    - $PP_{i}$ released: $2$\n\n4.  **Final Acylations and Total Stoichiometry**\n    The late acyltransferases like $LpxL$ and $LpxM$ use acyl-$ACP$ donors and, as stated, do not consume $ATP$ or $UTP$. They do not contribute to the final count.\n\n    We now sum the contributions from all stages to find the net stoichiometry for the synthesis of one molecule of Kdo$_2$-Lipid A.\n    - **Total $UTP$ consumed** = (from GlcNAc activation) $2$ + (from phosphorylation) $0$ + (from Kdo activation) $0$ = $2$.\n    - **Total $ATP$ consumed** = (from GlcNAc activation) $0$ + (from phosphorylation) $1$ + (from Kdo activation) $0$ = $1$.\n    - **Total $PP_{i}$ released** = (from GlcNAc activation) $2$ + (from phosphorylation) $0$ + (from Kdo activation) $2$ = $4$.\n\nThe derived net stoichiometry for the synthesis of one molecule of Kdo$_2$-Lipid A is the consumption of $2$ molecules of $UTP$, the consumption of $1$ molecule of $ATP$, and the release of $4$ molecules of $PP_{i}$. This is represented by the triplet $(2, 1, 4)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2504610"}, {"introduction": "Genetic perturbations are powerful tools for dissecting the logic of biological pathways.

KdsB catalyzes the activation of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) with cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to form cytidine monophosphate-KDO (CMP-KDO), the essential donor substrate for the KDO transferase WaaA (also known as KdtA), which attaches KDO to the lipid A moiety as the first step of inner-core assembly in lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is then transported to the outer membrane by the lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) system. At a permissive temperature $T_p$ (for example, $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), the mutant grows normally. Upon shift to a restrictive temperature $T_r$ (for example, $42^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), the temperature-sensitive KdsB rapidly loses activity.\n\nUsing only fundamental principles of enzyme-mediated biosynthetic pathways and known checkpoints in LPS assembly and export—namely, that glycosyltransfer to lipid A requires an activated donor and that the Lpt system recognizes a minimal core-lipid A structure—predict the most likely structural intermediate(s) that accumulate, the effect on LPS export, and the envelope phenotype that will emerge within a short time (for example, within $1$ to $2$ generations) after the temperature shift. Which of the following outcomes is most consistent with these principles?\n\nA. Rapid depletion of surface LPS with accumulation of KDO-deficient lipid A species (for example, lipid $\\mathrm{IV_A}$) in the inner membrane; failure of O-antigen ligation; impeded recognition by the Lpt system; envelope stress and increased permeability leading to heightened sensitivity to large antibiotics (for example, vancomycin); a deep-rough phenotype.\n\nB. Accumulation of CMP-KDO and accelerated KDO transfer, yielding hyper-elongated inner cores and enhanced barrier function; decreased sensitivity to detergents and hydrophobic antibiotics.\n\nC. Persistence of normal LPS export because KdsA supplies KDO directly to WaaA without prior activation; only minor growth effects at $T_r$.\n\nD. Replacement of KDO by heptose through substrate specificity switching in WaaA, producing a heptose-initiated core that is sufficiently recognized by the Lpt system; moderate outer membrane defects but overall viability.\n\nE.

Let's deduce the consequences step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Primary Biochemical Block**: The enzyme KdsB catalyzes the synthesis of cytidine monophosphate-KDO (CMP-KDO) from 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP).\n    $$ \\text{KDO} + \\text{CTP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{KdsB}} \\text{CMP-KDO} + PP_i $$\n    Upon inactivation of KdsB at $T_r$, the synthesis of CMP-KDO ceases. The cellular pool of this essential substrate will be rapidly depleted.\n\n2.  **Effect on Core Biosynthesis**: CMP-KDO is the essential activated sugar donor for the KDO transferase WaaA, which attaches the first KDO residues to the lipid A precursor to initiate core assembly.\n    $$ \\text{Lipid A precursor} + n(\\text{CMP-KDO}) \\xrightarrow{\\text{WaaA}} \\text{KDO}_n\\text{-Lipid A precursor} + n(\\text{CMP}) $$\n    Without the donor substrate CMP-KDO, the WaaA-catalyzed reaction is blocked. No KDO can be attached to lipid A.\n\n3.  **Accumulation of Intermediates**: The substrate for the blocked reaction, the lipid A precursor, will accumulate. In *Escherichia coli*, this precursor is typically lipid $\\mathrm{IV_A}$ (a tetra-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine phosphate). Therefore, KDO-deficient lipid A species will build up in the inner membrane, where their synthesis occurs.\n\n4.  **Consequences for Downstream LPS Assembly**: The synthesis of a complete LPS molecule is halted. The entire core polysaccharide cannot be assembled, and O-antigen ligation by WaaL, which requires a complete core as an acceptor, also fails.\n\n5.  **Effect on LPS Transport**: The lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) system recognizes a minimal core-lipid A structure for export (e.g., KDO$_2$-lipid A in *E. coli*). The accumulating KDO-deficient lipid A precursor is not a substrate for the Lpt system. Consequently, the transport of LPS to the outer membrane stops.\n\n6.  **Envelope Phenotype**: As the cell grows, the existing LPS in the outer membrane is diluted without replacement, leading to a progressive loss of the outer membrane's barrier function. This defect, known as a deep-rough phenotype, dramatically increases permeability to hydrophobic compounds and large hydrophilic antibiotics (like vancomycin) that are normally excluded. The accumulation of toxic lipid precursors and the catastrophic failure of the outer membrane barrier trigger severe envelope stress and are ultimately lethal.\n\nBased on this derivation, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n*   **A**: This option correctly predicts the rapid depletion of surface LPS, accumulation of KDO-deficient lipid A (like lipid $\\mathrm{IV_A}$) in the inner membrane, failure of downstream steps (O-antigen ligation, Lpt transport), and the resulting deep-rough phenotype characterized by envelope stress and hypersensitivity to antibiotics. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n\n*   **B**: This is incorrect. Inactivation of KdsB causes depletion, not accumulation, of CMP-KDO.\n\n*   **C**: This is incorrect. It violates the principle that glycosyltransferases like WaaA require activated sugar-nucleotide donors. The block in LPS synthesis is lethal, not a cause of minor growth defects.\n\n*   **D**: This is incorrect. It proposes an improbable substrate-switching event. The essentiality of the `kdsB` gene demonstrates that such a bypass mechanism is not viable.\n\n*   **E**: This is incorrect. The Lpt system does not export KDO-less lipid A, WaaL cannot ligate O-antigen to an incomplete core, and the loss of LPS causes a severe, not negligible, permeability defect.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the most accurate and comprehensive description of the expected outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2504653"}, {"introduction": "The synthesis of a complete lipopolysaccharide molecule is only half the battle; it must then be transported across the periplasm and inserted into the outer membrane. This final, essential step is performed by the Lpt translocon, a remarkable molecular machine with a proposed 'lateral gate' mechanism for inserting LPS into the outer leaflet. This practice asks you to analyze the functional consequences of engineered mutations that trap this gate in either a locked or open state [@problem_id:2504668], providing a deep, mechanistic insight into outer membrane biogenesis and integrity.", "problem": "A Gram-negative bacterium maintains an asymmetric outer membrane in which the outer leaflet is enriched in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the inner leaflet is composed primarily of phospholipids. The barrier function of this asymmetric bilayer excludes both large hydrophilic antibiotics and many hydrophobic compounds, unless the outer membrane is compromised. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is transported from the inner membrane to the outer membrane by the Lpt pathway, in which the LptBFGC complex extracts LPS from the inner membrane, the periplasmic protein LptA bridges the periplasm, and the outer membrane translocon LptDE inserts LPS into the outer leaflet. Structural and genetic evidence indicate that LptD forms a $\\beta$-barrel with a lateral gate between its first and last $\\beta$-strands, and that LPS partitions into the outer leaflet via transient opening of this lateral gate rather than by passage through a closed lumen. LptE sits within the LptD barrel and stabilizes the translocon.\n\nConsider two engineered alleles of the outer membrane translocon component LptD, expressed at wild-type levels in otherwise isogenic cells:\n- lptD-lock: a covalent cross-link between the first and last $\\beta$-strands that prevents lateral gate opening under physiological conditions.\n- lptD-open: substitutions that destabilize interactions at the lateral gate, biasing it toward spontaneous opening.\n\nAssume that in both alleles the remainder of the Lpt pathway is intact and that the cells are viable under the assay conditions. You examine the following phenotypes: (i) accumulation of LPS on the periplasmic side of the outer membrane translocon, (ii) activation of the envelope stress extracytoplasmic function sigma factor $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ (RpoE), (iii) evidence for phospholipid exposure in the outer leaflet as inferred by increased activity of the palmitoyl transferase PagP, and (iv) susceptibility to the large hydrophilic glycopeptide vancomycin and to the hydrophobic antibiotic rifampin.\n\nWhich option best predicts the pattern of phenotypes for these two alleles based on the definitions above and the mechanism of LPS insertion?\n\nA. lptD-lock: LPS accumulates at the periplasmic face of LptDE; strong $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation; no PagP activation; pronounced hypersensitivity to both vancomycin and rifampin. lptD-open: no periplasmic LPS accumulation; moderate $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation; clear PagP activation; hypersensitivity to vancomycin and rifampin that is less severe than lptD-lock.\n\nB. lptD-lock: no periplasmic LPS accumulation; weak $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation; strong PagP activation; unchanged susceptibility to vancomycin and rifampin. lptD-open: LPS accumulates periplasmically; strong $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation; no PagP activation; hypersensitivity only to rifampin.\n\nC. lptD-lock: barrier is tightened by a permanently closed gate, leading to decreased susceptibility to both vancomycin and rifampin and reduced $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation; no PagP activation; no periplasmic LPS accumulation. lptD-open: increased vancomycin resistance due to faster LPS insertion; no change in rifampin susceptibility; no change in PagP.\n\nD. lptD-lock: LPS accumulates periplasmically; strong $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation; strong PagP activation; hypersensitivity only to vancomycin but not to rifampin. lptD-open: no periplasmic LPS accumulation; weak $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation; no PagP activation; unchanged susceptibility to vancomycin but hypersensitivity to rifampin.", "solution": "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the predicted phenotypes for two engineered mutants of the LptD outer membrane protein, based on the provided lateral gate mechanism for LPS insertion.\n\n**Analysis of the `lptD-lock` Allele**\nThe lateral gate of the LptD protein is locked shut, preventing LPS from exiting the translocon into the outer leaflet.\n1.  **LPS Accumulation:** Because LPS transport across the periplasm is intact but the final insertion step is blocked, LPS molecules will accumulate at the periplasmic face of the LptDE complex, unable to proceed.\n2.  **$\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ Activation:** A complete blockage of outer membrane biogenesis is a potent trigger for the $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ envelope stress response. The cell detects the failure to assemble its surface and the accumulation of unassembled components. Strong $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation is expected.\n3.  **PagP Activation:** The enzyme PagP is activated by phospholipids in the outer leaflet. The primary defect in the `lptD-lock` mutant is a blockage of LPS insertion, not a structural breach that promotes phospholipid flipping. Therefore, direct activation of PagP is not the primary consequence, although chronic failure to insert LPS may secondarily disrupt asymmetry.\n4.  **Antibiotic Susceptibility:** A failure to replenish the outer leaflet with new LPS molecules during growth leads to a catastrophic loss of the outer membrane's barrier function. The resulting leaky membrane allows entry of both large hydrophilic antibiotics (vancomycin) and hydrophobic antibiotics (rifampin) that are normally excluded. This results in pronounced hypersensitivity to both.\n\n**Analysis of the `lptD-open` Allele**\nThe lateral gate is unstable and prone to spontaneous opening, creating a persistent or frequent disruption in the translocon structure.\n1.  **LPS Accumulation:** The gate is open, so LPS is not blocked from being inserted into the outer leaflet. No accumulation of LPS on the periplasmic side is expected.\n2.  **$\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ Activation:** The leaky, compromised structure of the LptDE translocon disrupts outer membrane integrity and lipid asymmetry, which are forms of envelope stress. This will trigger the $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ response. However, since LPS transport is not completely halted, the stress may be less severe than in the `lptD-lock` mutant. Moderate activation is a reasonable prediction.\n3.  **PagP Activation:** The unstable, open gate provides a direct pathway for phospholipids from the inner leaflet to mislocalize to the outer leaflet, which is the specific trigger for PagP activation. Clear PagP activation is expected.\n4.  **Antibiotic Susceptibility:** The perpetually leaky gate at each LptDE complex compromises the overall barrier function of the outer membrane, increasing permeability. This leads to hypersensitivity to both vancomycin and rifampin. However, since LPS insertion is still occurring, the global barrier defect may be less severe than in the `lptD-lock` mutant, where LPS replenishment is completely stopped.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n*   **A:** This option's predictions for both alleles match our analysis perfectly. For `lptD-lock`, it correctly identifies LPS accumulation, strong $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ stress, no primary PagP activation, and broad hypersensitivity. For `lptD-open`, it correctly notes no LPS accumulation, moderate stress, clear PagP activation (the key distinction), and broad but less severe hypersensitivity.\n*   **B:** This option incorrectly states that `lptD-lock` has no LPS accumulation and that `lptD-open` does. It also misassigns PagP activation.\n*   **C:** This option is based on the false premise that a non-functional transporter strengthens the barrier. It fundamentally misunderstands the biology.\n*   **D:** This option incorrectly predicts selective antibiotic sensitivity. A general barrier defect should affect both classes of antibiotics.
