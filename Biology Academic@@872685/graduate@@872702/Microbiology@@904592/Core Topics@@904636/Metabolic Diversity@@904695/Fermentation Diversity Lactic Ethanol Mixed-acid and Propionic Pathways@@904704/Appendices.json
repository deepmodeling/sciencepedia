The solution must be derived from fundamental biochemical principles of conservation: mass (carbon precursor), energy (ATP), and redox potential (NADH).\n\nFirst, we must formalize the constraints given in the problem statement into a system of algebraic equations. Let $a$, $e$, $s$, and $l$ be the molar yields of acetate, ethanol, succinate, and lactate, respectively, per mole of glucose consumed.\n\n1.  **$C_3$ Precursor Balance:**\n    Glycolysis of one mole of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) produces two moles of $C_3$ precursors at the level of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate. These precursors are the entry points for all subsequent fermentation pathways.\n    -   The succinate branch consumes one PEP ($C_3$) per mole of succinate produced. Thus, a yield of $s$ consumes $s$ moles of $C_3$ precursor.\n    -   The lactate branch consumes one pyruvate ($C_3$) per mole of lactate. A yield of $l$ consumes $l$ moles of $C_3$ precursor.\n    -   The acetate and ethanol branches both originate from acetyl-CoA, which is formed from pyruvate via the pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) reaction. One mole of pyruvate yields one mole of acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA pool is then partitioned into acetate and ethanol. Therefore, total production of $a$ moles of acetate and $e$ moles of ethanol requires $a+e$ moles of pyruvate.\n    The total consumption of $C_3$ precursors must equal the total production from one mole of glucose, which is $2$.

ATP is produced during glycolysis ($2$ moles per mole of glucose) and in the acetate branch ($1$ mole per mole of acetate). The ATP generated is assumed to exactly meet the demand without overproduction.\n    $$2 + a = A = 2.7$$\n    This directly determines the acetate yield for both the wild type and the mutant:\n    $$a = 0.7 \\quad (2)$$\n    This is a critical constraint, indicating that acetate flux is fixed by the cell's energy requirement.\n\n3.  **NADH Redox Balance:**\n    Under anaerobic conditions, the cell must maintain redox balance by reoxidizing all NADH produced during glycolysis.\n    -   NADH production from one mole of glucose is $2$ moles.\n    -   NADH is consumed by three pathways:\n        -   Lactate formation: $1$ mole NADH per mole of lactate ($l$).\n        -   Ethanol formation: $2$ moles NADH per mole of ethanol ($2e$).\n        -   Succinate formation: $1$ mole NADH per mole of succinate ($s$).\n    For redox neutrality, NADH production must equal consumption:\n    $$l + 2e + s = 2 \\quad (3)$$\n\nNow, we apply this system of equations to solve for the product yields in both the wild type (WT) and the mutant ($\\Delta ldhA$) strains.\n\n**Wild Type (WT) Analysis:**\nThe problem provides measured yields for the wild type: $l_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.4$ and $s_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.2$.\nFrom the ATP balance (Equation 2), we have $a_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.7$.\nWe can use Equation (1) to find the ethanol yield, $e_{\\mathrm{WT}}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{WT}} + l_{\\mathrm{WT}} + a_{\\mathrm{WT}} + e_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 2$$\n$$0.2 + 0.4 + 0.7 + e_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 2$$\n$$1.3 + e_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 2 \\implies e_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.7$$\nTo confirm consistency, we must verify these yields satisfy the redox balance (Equation 3):\n$$l_{\\mathrm{WT}} + 2e_{\\mathrm{WT}} + s_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.4 + 2(0.7) + 0.2 = 0.4 + 1.4 + 0.2 = 2.0$$\nThe redox balance holds.
