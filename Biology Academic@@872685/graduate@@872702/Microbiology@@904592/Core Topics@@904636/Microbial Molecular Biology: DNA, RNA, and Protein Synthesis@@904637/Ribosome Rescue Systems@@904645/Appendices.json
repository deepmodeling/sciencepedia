Assume a well-mixed cytosolic environment at steady state with no depletion of components. In this regime, each pathway is described by a time-to-event (waiting time) that is exponential and memoryless, consistent with a first-order hazard arising from the law of mass action applied to an initial bimolecular association step that limits the overall rate.

The time-to-event for each pathway is described as an exponential random variable, which is a standard and appropriate model for a memoryless, first-order kinetic process.\n\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically well-posed. We proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the waiting times for the four rescue pathways be denoted by the independent random variables $T_{\\mathrm{tm}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $T_{\\mathrm{R}}$, corresponding to the tmRNA-SmpB, ArfA:RF2, ArfB, and spontaneous restart pathways, respectively.

This is the probability that the waiting time $T_{\\mathrm{tm}}$ is shorter than the waiting times of all other pathways: $P(T_{\\mathrm{tm}} < T_{\\mathrm{A}} \\text{ and } T_{\\mathrm{tm}} < T_{\\mathrm{B}} \\text{ and } T_{\\mathrm{tm}} < T_{\\mathrm{R}})$.\n\nTo derive this probability, we can integrate over all possible values of $T_{\\mathrm{tm}}$. Let $t$ be a specific value for the waiting time of the tmRNA pathway. The probability that $T_{\\mathrm{tm}}$ falls into an infinitesimal interval $[t, t+dt]$ is $f_{\\mathrm{tm}}(t)dt = k_{\\mathrm{tm}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{tm}} t) dt$.

We set up the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[1 + f(T_{1/2})]^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $f(T_{1/2})$:\n$$\n[1 + f(T_{1/2})]^2 = 2\n$$\nSince $f(T) \\ge 0$ for all $T \\ge 0$, the term $1 + f(T_{1/2})$ must be positive. Taking the positive square root of both sides:\n$$\n1 + f(T_{1/2}) = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n$$\nf(T_{1/2}) = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n$$\nNow, we substitute the definition of $f(T)$:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{1/2}^{n}}{K^{n} + T_{1/2}^{n}} = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n$$\nTo solve for $T_{1/2}$, we first solve for $T_{1/2}^{n}$. Let $X = T_{1/2}^{n}$.\n$$\n\\frac{X}{K^{n} + X} = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n$$\n$$\nX = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)(K^{n} + X) = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)K^{n} + (\\sqrt{2} - 1)X\n$$\nGroup terms containing $X$:\n$$\nX - (\\sqrt{2} - 1)X = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)K^{n}\n$$\n$$\nX(1 - \\sqrt{2} + 1) = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)K^{n}\n$$\n$$\nX(2 - \\sqrt{2}) = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)K^{n}\n$$\n$$\nX = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{2 - \\sqrt{2}} K^{n}\n$$\nThe fractional coefficient can be simplified by factoring $\\sqrt{2}$ from the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{2 - \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2} - 1)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2^{-1/2}\n$$\nTherefore, the expression for $X$ becomes:\n$$\nX = T_{1/2}^{n} = 2^{-1/2} K^{n}\n$$\nFinally, we take the $n$-th root of both sides to find $T_{1/2}$:\n$$\nT_{1/2} = (2^{-1/2} K^{n})^{\\frac{1}{n}} = (2^{-1/2})^{\\frac{1}{n}} (K^{n})^{\\frac{1}{n}} = K \\cdot 2^{-\\frac{1}{2n}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for $T_{1/2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{K 2^{-\\frac{1}{2n}}}\n$$", "id": "2530800"}]}
