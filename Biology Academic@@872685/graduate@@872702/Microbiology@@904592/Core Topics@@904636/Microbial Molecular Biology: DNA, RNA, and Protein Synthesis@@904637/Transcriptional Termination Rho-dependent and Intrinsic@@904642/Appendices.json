In this assay, ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase (RNAP) encounters a single candidate termination site during elongation. Each transcription event yields exactly one of two mutually exclusive RNA products: a terminated transcript that ends at the candidate site, counted as $T$, or a readthrough transcript that extends into the downstream region, counted as $R$. The experiment is performed under conditions in which detection efficiencies for the two RNA species are equal and there are no alternative processing pathways or cryptic terminators.

The model of transcription termination as a stochastic competition between two outcomes (termination vs. elongation) is a cornerstone of the field. The experimental setup described is a standard in-vivo or in-vitro reporter assay used in molecular biology. The provided principles are fundamental axioms of probability theory applied to a large ensemble of stochastic events, which is a correct physical and statistical abstraction for this biological process. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective. It provides all necessary conditions—such as equal detection efficiency and absence of confounding pathways—to permit a formal derivation. The data are numerically plausible. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific law.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nSolution Derivation:\nLet $E_T$ be the event that an RNAP molecule terminates at the candidate site, and $E_R$ be the event that it reads through. According to the problem statement, these are the only two possible and mutually exclusive outcomes for any given RNAP that reaches the site. Let $P(E_T)$ and $P(E_R)$ denote the probabilities of these respective events.\n\nFrom foundational principle (ii), the sum of probabilities of all mutually exclusive outcomes must be unity. Therefore:\n$$P(E_T) + P(E_R) = 1$$\n\nThe Termination Efficiency, $TE$, is defined as the probability that RNAP terminates at the site. Thus, by definition:\n$$TE = P(E_T)$$\n\nThe problem states that an experiment is performed in which a large number of transcription events are observed. The counts of terminated transcripts, $T$, and readthrough transcripts, $R$, are measured. The total number of observed events, $N_{total}$, is therefore the sum of these counts:\n$$N_{total} = T + R$$\n\nAccording to foundational principle (iii), for a large number of events, the observed counts are proportional to the underlying probabilities. The problem simplifies this by stating that detection efficiencies for both species are equal. This crucial condition implies that the ratio of observed counts is a direct and unbiased estimator of the ratio of the underlying probabilities. The observed frequency of termination is the number of termination events divided by the total number of events. This frequency serves as the maximum likelihood estimator for the probability $P(E_T)$.\n$$P(E_T) = \\frac{T}{T + R}$$\n\nCombining the definition of $TE$ with this result gives the required expression:\n$$TE = \\frac{T}{T + R}$$\n\nNumerical Calculation:\nThe problem provides the experimental data: $T = 600$ and $R = 400$. We substitute these values into the derived expression for $TE$.\n$$TE = \\frac{600}{600 + 400} = \\frac{600}{1000} = 0.6$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.6$ is exact. To express this with four significant figures, we write:\n$$TE = 0.6000$$\n\nConceptual Interpretation:\nA termination efficiency of $TE = 0.6000$, or $60\\%$, indicates that the terminator is moderately strong under the given experimental conditions. It effectively halts $60\\%$ of elongating RNAP molecules that encounter it, while $40\\%$ are permitted to read through.\n\nThe experiment was conducted with a saturating concentration of Rho factor. Bacterial transcription termination occurs via two primary mechanisms: intrinsic termination and Rho-dependent termination. Intrinsic termination relies solely on specific sequences in the nascent RNA, typically a stable hairpin structure followed by a U-rich tract, which destabilize the elongation complex. Rho-dependent termination requires the Rho protein, an ATP-dependent helicase, to bind a specific recognition site (a \"rut\" site) on the nascent RNA and translocate along it to dislodge RNAP.\n\nThe measured $TE$ of $0.6000$ represents the *total* termination efficiency, which is a composite of any intrinsic activity of the DNA/RNA element and the action of the Rho factor. From this single experiment, one cannot de-convolute the two contributions. The terminator in question might be:\n1.  A purely Rho-dependent terminator that has zero intrinsic activity.\n2.  A purely intrinsic terminator whose efficiency is coincidentally $60\\%$ and is unaffected by Rho.\n3.  A composite terminator possessing both a basal level of intrinsic termination and a sequence that allows for additional Rho-dependent termination. In this case, the total measured efficiency is the result of both pathways acting.\n\nTo distinguish between these possibilities, a parallel control experiment in the absence of Rho activity (e.g., using a Rho inhibitor like bicyclomycin, or a Rho-deficient genetic background) would be necessary. The efficiency measured in such a control experiment would isolate the intrinsic component, $TE_{intrinsic}$. The contribution from Rho could then be inferred by comparing $TE_{intrinsic}$ with the total efficiency measured here. Without such a control, we can only conclude that the terminator element, in concert with a saturating amount of Rho factor, achieves an overall termination efficiency of $60\\%$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6000}$$", "id": "2541500"}, {"introduction": "Intrinsic termination relies on the precise architecture of the nascent RNA transcript itself, without the help of protein factors. One of its two key features is a stable hairpin structure that forms and disrupts the transcribing RNA polymerase.

It provides the necessary information—the nature of the mutation and the components that remain unchanged—to construct a logical argument.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe solution requires analysis of two interconnected effects: the thermodynamic stability of the RNA hairpin and the kinetic efficiency of the termination process.\n\n**1. Analysis of the change in hairpin folding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$**\n\nThe stability of an RNA secondary structure, such as a hairpin, is quantified by the standard free energy of folding, $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$. A more stable structure corresponds to a more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$. The primary contributions to this stability are the hydrogen bonds within base pairs and, more significantly, the free energy changes associated with the stacking of adjacent base pairs.\n\nGuanine–cytosine ($GC$) base pairs are stabilized by three hydrogen bonds, whereas adenine–uridine ($AU$) pairs have two. Consequently, $GC$ pairs are intrinsically more stable. Furthermore, the stacking interactions involving $GC$ pairs (e.g., a $\\mathrm{GC}$ pair stacked on a $\\mathrm{CG}$ pair) are thermodynamically more favorable (i.e., contribute a more negative $\\Delta G$) than stacks involving only $AU$ pairs.\n\nThe problem states that two $GC$ base pairs are removed from the hairpin stem. This perturbation has two consequences:\n- It eliminates the hydrogen bonds of two $GC$ pairs.\n- It eliminates the favorable stacking interactions associated with these pairs.\n\nBoth effects reduce the overall stability of the hairpin. A reduction in stability means the folded state is less energetically favorable relative to the unfolded state. Therefore, the value of $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ must become less negative, which is to say it must increase.\n\nTo estimate the magnitude of this change, we refer to the nearest-neighbor model of RNA thermodynamics. The free energy contribution of adding a single $GC$ base pair to a growing helix depends on the identity of its neighbor but is typically in the range of $-2$ to $-3.5~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ at $37~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Removing two $GC$ pairs, therefore, results in a positive (destabilizing) change in $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$. The total change is approximately twice the stabilizing energy of a single $GC$ pair's contribution, so a change of roughly $2 \\times (+2~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})$ to $2 \\times (+3~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})$ is expected. This leads to a total change in $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ of approximately $+4$ to $+6~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the change in termination efficiency, $\\mathrm{TE}$**\n\nThe mechanism of intrinsic termination is a synergistic process involving two critical events:\n- **Hairpin Formation:** As the nascent RNA emerges from the RNA polymerase (RNAP) exit channel, the terminator sequence folds into a stable hairpin. This structure is thought to invade the RNAP, disrupt crucial interactions holding the transcription complex together, and induce pausing of the polymerase.\n- **U-tract Instability:** The pausing induced by the hairpin occurs while the RNAP is transcribing the $U$-tract. The RNA-DNA hybrid in this region consists of a run of rU-dA base pairs, which is the least stable of all possible nucleic acid duplexes.\n\nThe efficiency of termination ($\\mathrm{TE}$) depends critically on the stability of the hairpin. A more stable hairpin (more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$) forms more rapidly and/or is more mechanically robust, making it more effective at disrupting the RNAP complex and inducing a sufficiently long pause. This pause provides the kinetic window of opportunity for the inherently weak rU-dA hybrid to dissociate, releasing the transcript.\n\nConversely, a less stable hairpin, as produced by the described mutation, is a less effective terminator. Its formation is thermodynamically disfavored, meaning it will form less frequently or exist for a shorter time. It will be less capable of disrupting the RNAP, leading to a shorter pause or no pause at all. If the pause is too brief, the RNAP will transcribe past the $U$-tract before the weak hybrid has time to dissociate, resulting in read-through of the terminator.\n\nSince the mutations make the hairpin less stable ($\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes less negative), the efficiency of the termination process must decrease.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mutations that remove $2$ $GC$ base pairs will make $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ less negative (an increase of approximately $+4$ to $+6~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$) and will cause a decrease in termination efficiency, $\\mathrm{TE}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes less negative by approximately $+4 \\text{ to } +6~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and $\\mathrm{TE}$ decreases.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation from first principles. The direction and magnitude of the change in $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ are correct, as is the predicted effect on $\\mathrm{TE}$. **Correct**.\n\n- **B. $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes more negative by approximately $-4 \\text{ to } -6~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and $\\mathrm{TE}$ increases.**\nThis is incorrect. Removing stabilizing $GC$ pairs must destabilize the hairpin, making $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ *less* negative, not more. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ remains approximately unchanged due to compensation by flanking AU pairs, and $\\mathrm{TE}$ remains essentially the same.**\nThis is incorrect. The removal of two highly stable $GC$ pairs is a significant perturbation. There is no physical basis for \"compensation\" by flanking pairs without structural rearrangement, and the problem states no such compensatory pairs are formed. A significant change in hairpin stability must lead to a change in $\\mathrm{TE}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes less negative, but $\\mathrm{TE}$ increases because a shorter hairpin releases the RNA more readily from RNAP.**\nThe premise that $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes less negative is correct. However, the reasoning and conclusion regarding $\\mathrm{TE}$ are fundamentally flawed. The hairpin's role is to disrupt the polymerase, not to \"release itself\". A weaker, shorter hairpin is less effective at this role, which leads to a decrease, not an increase, in $\\mathrm{TE}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. Only Rho-dependent termination is affected; intrinsic $\\mathrm{TE}$ is unchanged because the uridine tract is intact.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem concerns an intrinsic terminator, not a Rho-dependent one. Furthermore, intrinsic termination depends on *both* the hairpin and the $U$-tract.

The assumptions ($[\\mathrm{Rho}]$, $v_R$, $v_P$, $\\tau_p$ are constant) are crucial for isolating the effects of the mutation on Rho loading, making the problem solvable. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem asks for the effect of a specific mutation on Rho binding affinity ($K_d$) and overall termination probability ($P_T$). We must analyze the consequences of the mutation as described.\n\n1.  **Effect on Rho Binding:**\n    The problem states that the wild-type rut site is \"cytidine-rich\" and \"largely unstructured,\" which are the preferred characteristics for Rho binding. The mutation introduces two changes, both of which are disfavorable to Rho according to Fact (ii):\n    a.  **Compositional change:** The cytidine fraction ($f_C$) decreases while the guanosine fraction ($f_G$) increases. Rho \"disfavors guanosine-rich content.\"\n    b.  **Structural change:** The mutant RNA forms a \"more stable local secondary structure\" with $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} \\approx -3~\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. Rho requires \"single-stranded\" RNA for binding and \"disfavors ... stable secondary structure.\"\n\n    Both of these changes make the mutant rut site a poorer substrate for Rho. A poorer substrate leads to weaker binding. Binding affinity is inversely proportional to the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. Therefore, a decrease in binding affinity corresponds to an **increase in $K_d$**.\n\n2.  **Effect on Binding Kinetics:**\n    The equilibrium constant $K_d$ is a ratio of rate constants, $K_d = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The initial loading of Rho onto the RNA is governed by the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$. This process requires Rho to find and bind to an accessible, single-stranded, C-rich region.\n    - The increased secondary structure in the mutant reduces the population of accessible single-stranded RNA molecules, thereby decreasing the effective concentration of valid binding sites. This will lower the OBSERVED rate of association.\n    - The change in composition to be less C-rich and more G-rich makes the site intrinsically less attractive to Rho.\n    - Both effects will lead to a **decrease in the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$**. A decrease in $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ contributes to the increase in $K_d$.\n\n3.  **Effect on Termination Probability ($P_T$):**\n    Fact (iv) states that \"the termination probability $P_T$ increases with the probability of timely loading within a pause window of duration $\\tau_p$.\" The rate of loading is a function of the Rho concentration, $[\\mathrm{Rho}]$, and the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$. Since $[\\mathrm{Rho}]$ is assumed to be constant, a decrease in $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ directly implies a slower rate of Rho loading onto the nascent transcript.\n    - With a slower loading rate, it is less likely that Rho will successfully load onto the rut site during the finite time window $\\tau_p$ when the RNA polymerase is paused.\n    - If Rho fails to load in time, the polymerase will resume elongation, and the opportunity for termination at that pause site is lost.\n    - The problem specifies that other factors affecting termination ($v_R$, $v_P$, $\\tau_p$) are unchanged. Thus, the decrease in loading probability is the dominant effect.\n    - Consequently, the overall Rho-dependent termination probability, **$P_T$, must decrease**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mutation will cause $K_d$ to increase, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ to decrease, and $P_T$ to decrease.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $K_d$ increases (binding affinity decreases), $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ decreases due to reduced accessible cytidine-rich single-stranded RNA, and $P_T$ decreases because timely loading within $\\tau_p$ is less likely while $v_R$ and $v_P$ are unchanged.**\nThis statement correctly identifies that $K_d$ increases, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ decreases, and $P_T$ decreases. The reasoning provided for each change—reduced accessibility of the binding site impacting $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the subsequent impact of slower loading on $P_T$—is fully consistent with the derivation from first principles. The mention of \"reduced accessible ... single-stranded RNA\" correctly captures the consequence of a more stable secondary structure.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $K_d$ decreases (binding affinity increases), $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ increases due to enhanced base stacking on guanosine-rich RNA, and $P_T$ increases because Rho loads faster and more tightly.**\nThis option claims $K_d$ decreases (affinity increases), which is the opposite of the derived effect. The mutation makes the site *less* favorable for Rho. The reasoning that \"enhanced base stacking on guanosine-rich RNA\" would increase $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is incorrect, as Rho \"disfavors guanosine-rich content.\" All conclusions are incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $K_d$ and $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ remain approximately unchanged because Rho recognizes any single-stranded RNA non-specifically, but $P_T$ decreases because enhanced hairpin formation physically blocks Rho translocation after loading.**\nThis option's premise that $K_d$ and $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ are unchanged is flawed. It contradicts Fact (ii), which specifies Rho's preference for C-rich and G-poor sequences, indicating that its binding is not entirely non-specific. While stable secondary structure can indeed block translocation (a valid mechanism), the primary and most direct effect of the mutation as described is on the initial binding/loading step, which this option wrongly claims is unaffected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $K_d$ increases (binding affinity decreases) and $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ decreases, but $P_T$ increases because Rho translocates faster on guanosine-rich RNA even if loading is impaired.**\nThis option correctly states that $K_d$ increases and $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ decreases. However, it claims $P_T$ increases. The reasoning, \"Rho translocates faster on guanosine-rich RNA,\" is an unfounded assertion and, more importantly, it directly contradicts the problem's explicit assumption that the translocation velocity $v_R$ is unchanged.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $K_d$ increases (binding affinity decreases) while $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ increases due to faster nucleation on guanosine tracts, leading to a net decrease in $P_T$ because dissociation dominates.**\nThis option correctly states that $K_d$ increases, but incorrectly claims that $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ increases. The reasoning \"faster nucleation on guanosine tracts\" is contrary to the stated properties of Rho, which disfavors G-rich sequences for binding. The internal logic of the option is confused and relies on an incorrect premise for the change in $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2541504"}]}
