Because B-form Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) has a helical twist of approximately $10.5$ base pairs per turn, the relative rotational orientation of these sites depends on the spacer length $L$ (in base pairs) between the centers of the $-35$ and $-10$ elements. Assume that each additional base pair rotates the downstream site by a fixed angle relative to the upstream site. Further assume that the sigma factor makes strongest simultaneous contact when the relative rotational orientation matches a required geometry, and that small deviations from this required orientation incur a harmonic energetic penalty.\n\nStarting from the following foundational facts:\n- Central Dogma context: transcription initiation requires recognition of promoter elements by RNAP and sigma factor.\n- B-form DNA twist: $10.5$ base pairs per turn (constant helical twist over the spacer).\n- Small-angle energetic cost: for a misalignment angle $\\Delta\\theta$ (in radians), the penalty is $E=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa\\,\\Delta\\theta^{2}$, where $\\kappa$ is an effective torsional coupling constant in units of $k_{B}T$ per radian squared.\n\nDo the following:\n1.

The angular increment per base pair, denoted by $\\alpha$, is therefore the total angle of a turn divided by the number of base pairs per turn.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi \\text{ rad}}{10.5 \\text{ bp}} $$\nThe relative angle between two points on the DNA helix separated by a spacer of length $L$ base pairs is the product of the length $L$ and the angular increment per base pair $\\alpha$. Let us denote this total angle as $\\theta(L)$.\n$$ \\theta(L) = \\alpha L = \\frac{2\\pi L}{10.5} $$\nThe \"rotational orientation\" or \"phasing\" of the $-10$ site relative to the $-35$ site is determined by this angle $\\theta(L)$. Because a rotation by any integer multiple of $2\\pi$ results in an identical orientation, the effective phasing is determined by $\\theta(L)$ modulo $2\\pi$. Therefore, the relative orientation between the $-35$ and $-10$ sites depends linearly on the spacer length $L$, with a periodicity dictated by the helical twist of the DNA.\n\n**Part 2: Smallest misalignment angle.**\nThe problem states that the promoter is optimally phased at a reference spacer length $L_0 = 17$. This implies that the angle $\\theta(L_0) = \\alpha L_0$ represents the ideal geometry for the sigma factor to bind both sites simultaneously. At any other spacer length $L$, the orientation is $\\theta(L) = \\alpha L$. The angular deviation from the optimal orientation is $\\theta(L) - \\theta(L_0) = \\alpha(L-L_0)$.\n\nHowever, the protein-DNA interaction is insensitive to full rotations of the DNA helix. An angular deviation of $\\alpha(L-L_0)$ is functionally equivalent to a deviation of $\\alpha(L-L_0) - 2\\pi n$ for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The energetic penalty is associated with the torsional stress required to achieve proper alignment. This stress corresponds to the smallest possible rotation needed to restore the optimal phasing. Thus, the relevant misalignment angle, $\\Delta\\theta(L)$, is the absolute value of the angular deviation minimized over all possible full turns. This corresponds precisely to the expression given in the problem statement:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta(L) = \\min_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\left| \\alpha(L-L_0) - 2\\pi n \\right| $$\nThe units for this angle, and for all angular measures in this derivation, are radians.
