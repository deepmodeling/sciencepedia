The fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is the probability that a riboswitch is in the ligand-bound conformation. The overall regulatory output of the gene controlled by the riboswitch is a population-weighted average of the expression levels corresponding to the unbound and bound states.\n\nFor a repressing riboswitch, ligand binding reduces or abolishes gene expression (e.g., by forming a transcription terminator). The unbound state is \"ON,\" and the bound state is \"OFF.\" The overall expression level is proportional to $(1-\\theta)$, the fraction of riboswitches in the active, unbound state. As ligand concentration increases, $\\theta$ increases from $0$ to $1$, causing the expression level to decrease. A higher $\\theta$ therefore corresponds to stronger repression.\n\nFor an activating riboswitch, ligand binding promotes gene expression (e.g., by resolving a terminator stem into an anti-terminator). The unbound state is \"OFF,\" and the bound state is \"ON.\" The overall expression level is directly proportional to $\\theta$, the fraction of riboswitches in the active, bound state. As ligand concentration increases, $\\theta$ increases, causing the expression level to increase. A higher $\\theta$ therefore corresponds to stronger activation.\n\nIn both scenarios, $\\theta$ acts as a transfer function that converts the input signal (ligand concentration) into the proportion of macromolecular switches that have changed state, which in turn dictates the magnitude of the downstream regulatory response.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.833}\n$$", "id": "2771122"}, {"introduction": "While the dissociation constant ($K_d$) quantitatively describes binding affinity, it is the underlying chemical interactions that dictate its value and confer specificity for the correct ligand.

As a result, $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ for the $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{C}$ variant is relatively large (weak binding) and selectivity against guanine is modest, because $\\mathrm{G}$ is favored by $\\mathrm{C}$ in a canonical $\\mathrm{G}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{C}$ pattern and can compete if steric or electrostatic exclusion is not perfect elsewhere in the pocket.\n\nTwo mutations to the pairing residue are proposed, each intended to probe the physical basis of specificity and affinity while leaving the rest of the pocket unchanged:\n\n- Mutation $1$: $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{U}$ (uridine), to allow a canonical $\\mathrm{A}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{U}$-like pattern on the Watson–Crick edge without requiring adenine protonation, typically providing two direct hydrogen bonds under neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n\n- Mutation $2$: $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow i\\!:\\!X$, where $X$ is an isosteric uridine analog such as $2$-pyridone that preserves the size and shape of a pyrimidine and the position of the $\\mathrm{O}2$ acceptor but lacks the $\\mathrm{N}3\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ donor; this maintains geometric complementarity while weakening hydrogen-bonding to $\\mathrm{A}$ (only one direct hydrogen bond instead of two), thereby probing whether shape complementarity alone can sustain selectivity and affinity.\n\nAssume the aptamer scaffold and solvent exposure remain unchanged across variants and that enthalpic contributions from hydrogen bonds and the protonation penalty are the dominant differences in $\\Delta G$ among these three cases.\n\nWhich option best predicts the qualitative effects of these two mutations on both adenine selectivity $S$ and adenine dissociation constant $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$, relative to the original $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{C}$ variant?\n\nA. $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{U}$: $S$ increases; $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ decreases. $i\\!:\\!X$: $S$ decreases; $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ increases.\n\nB. $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{U}$: $S$ decreases; $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ increases. $i\\!:\\!X$: $S$ increases; $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ decreases.\n\nC. $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{U}$: $S$ increases; $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ increases. $i\\!:\\!X$: $S$ unchanged; $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ decreases.\n\nD. $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{U}$: $S$ unchanged; $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ decreases. $i\\!:\\!X$: $S$ increases; $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ unchanged.", "solution": "To determine the effects of the mutations, we analyze how each change alters the chemical interactions for binding adenine (A) and guanine (G) relative to the original $i\\!:\\!\\mathrm{C}$ variant.

Eliminating the large energetic penalty significantly strengthens adenine binding.

This net loss of favorable interaction energy leads to weaker binding. Therefore, $K_d(\\mathrm{A})$ **increases**.\n- **Selectivity:** By removing a key hydrogen-bonding feature (the N3-H donor), the pocket's chemical pattern becomes less distinct and less capable of discriminating between the Watson-Crick edges of adenine and guanine. This loss of specificity reduces the aptamer's ability to preferentially bind adenine over guanine.
