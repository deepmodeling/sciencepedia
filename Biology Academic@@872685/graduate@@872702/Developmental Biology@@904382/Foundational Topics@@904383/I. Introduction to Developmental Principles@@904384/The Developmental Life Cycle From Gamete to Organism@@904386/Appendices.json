The provided parameters are biologically plausible. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, constants, and relationships to derive a unique integer solution. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires non-trivial reasoning to translate the biological model into a mathematical framework and solve it.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe objective is to find the smallest integer cleavage cycle number, denoted $c^{\\ast}$, at which the concentration of free histone octamers, $H_{\\mathrm{free}}(c)$, falls below a specified threshold, $H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$. The condition is given by the inequality:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{free}}(c) \\leq H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$$\n\nThe pool of free histones at cycle $c$, $H_{\\mathrm{free}}(c)$, is the total initial pool, $H_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, minus the amount bound to the newly synthesized DNA, $H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c)$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{free}}(c) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c)$$\n\nWe must first derive an expression for $H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c)$. The number of histone octamer-equivalents required to package one haploid genome of length $L$ is the number of nucleosomes, which is given as $L/b$.\nAt any given cleavage cycle $c$, the total number of haploid genome equivalents in the embryo is $G(c)$. The total number of histone octamers bound to DNA is therefore the number of histones per haploid genome multiplied by the total number of haploid genome equivalents.\n$$H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c) = G(c) \\cdot \\frac{L}{b}$$\n\nThe problem states that the number of haploid genome equivalents doubles with each cycle from an initial state $G_{0}$. This is expressed as:\n$$G(c) = G_{0} \\cdot 2^{c}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c)$ gives:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c) = \\frac{G_{0} \\cdot L \\cdot 2^{c}}{b}$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c)$ back into the inequality for transcriptional onset:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - \\frac{G_{0} \\cdot L \\cdot 2^{c}}{b} \\leq H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$$\n\nWe must now solve this inequality for $c$. Rearranging the terms to isolate the exponential term:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\leq \\frac{G_{0} \\cdot L \\cdot 2^{c}}{b}$$\n$$2^{c} \\geq \\frac{b \\cdot (H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{thr}})}{G_{0} \\cdot L}$$\n\nTo solve for $c$, we take the logarithm base $2$ of both sides. As the base $2$ is greater than $1$, the inequality direction is preserved.\n$$c \\geq \\log_{2}\\left( \\frac{b \\cdot (H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{thr}})}{G_{0} \\cdot L} \\right)$$\nUsing the change of base formula, $\\log_{a}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(a)}$, this is equivalent to:\n$$c \\geq \\frac{\\ln\\left( \\frac{b \\cdot (H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{thr}})}{G_{0} \\cdot L} \\right)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nThe problem defines $c^{\\ast}$ as the smallest integer $c$ that satisfies this condition. Therefore, $c^{\\ast}$ is the ceiling of the expression on the right-hand side. The explicit expression for $c^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\left\\lceil \\log_{2}\\left( \\frac{b \\cdot (H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{thr}})}{G_{0} \\cdot L} \\right) \\right\\rceil$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n$H_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 7.0 \\times 10^{10}$\n$H_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{9} = 0.5 \\times 10^{10}$\n$L = 1.5 \\times 10^{9}$\n$b = 200 = 2 \\times 10^{2}$\n$G_{0} = 2$\n\nFirst, calculate the terms within the argument of the logarithm:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 7.0 \\times 10^{10} - 0.5 \\times 10^{10} = 6.5 \\times 10^{10}$$\n$$G_{0} \\cdot L = 2 \\cdot (1.5 \\times 10^{9}) = 3.0 \\times 10^{9}$$\n\nNow, substitute these into the argument:\n$$\\frac{b \\cdot (H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{thr}})}{G_{0} \\cdot L} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{2}) \\cdot (6.5 \\times 10^{10})}{3.0 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{13 \\times 10^{12}}{3 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{13}{3} \\times 10^{3} = \\frac{13000}{3}$$\nThe value of the argument is approximately $4333.33$.\n\nWe must find the smallest integer $c$ such that $2^{c} \\geq \\frac{13000}{3}$. We test integer values of $c$:\nFor $c=12$:\n$$2^{12} = 4096$$\nWe check if $4096 \\geq \\frac{13000}{3}$. This is equivalent to checking if $3 \\cdot 4096 \\geq 13000$, which is $12288 \\geq 13000$. This is false.\n\nFor $c=13$:\n$$2^{13} = 8192$$\nWe check if $8192 \\geq \\frac{13000}{3}$. This is equivalent to checking if $3 \\cdot 8192 \\geq 13000$, which is $24576 \\geq 13000$. This is true.\n\nSince the condition is not met for $c=12$ but is met for $c=13$, the smallest integer value for the cleavage cycle number for transcriptional onset is $13$.\nTherefore, $c^{\\ast} = 13$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{13}$$", "id": "2680001"}, {"introduction": "The formation of repeating structures, such as the somites that give rise to our vertebrae, is a hallmark of animal development.

A somite is defined as the segment of tissue formed between two successive boundary-formation events.\n\nLet us denote the time of formation of the $n$-th somite boundary as $t_n$ and the position of this boundary as $x_n$. The formation of the next, $(n+1)$-th, boundary occurs at time $t_{n+1}$ and position $x_{n+1}$.\n\nAccording to assumption (i), boundary formation is dictated by the cellular oscillator. Assumption (iii) states this oscillator has a constant period $T$. The time interval between two consecutive segmentation events must therefore be equal to one period of the oscillator. Thus, the time elapsed during the formation of a single somite is:\n$$\n\\Delta t = t_{n+1} - t_n = T\n$$\n\nDuring this time interval $\\Delta t$, the determination front propagates through the presomitic mesoderm. According to assumption (ii), the front moves at a constant speed $v$.\n\nThe anteroposterior length of the newly formed somite, $S$, is precisely the distance the determination front travels during the time interval $\\Delta t = T$.\n\nUsing the fundamental kinematic relation provided—that distance is the product of speed and time—we can express the length $S$ as:\n$$\nS = v \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta t$, we arrive at the required expression for the somite length from first principles:\n$$\nS = vT\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically for the given parameters.\nGiven:\nWavefront speed, $v = 0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{min}$.\nOscillation period, $T = 90\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n\nThe units of $v$ and $T$ are compatible, yielding a length in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\n$$\nS = (0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{min}) \\times (90\\,\\mathrm{min}) = 72\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as instructed, the result is $S = 72.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFinally, we predict the new segment length, which we denote as $S'$, when the wavefront velocity is reduced twofold while the period remains constant.\nThe new velocity is $v' = \\frac{v}{2}$.\nThe period $T$ is unchanged.\n\nThe new segment length is given by the same derived formula:\n$$\nS' = v'T = \\left(\\frac{v}{2}\\right)T\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nv' = \\frac{0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{min}}{2} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{min}\n$$\n$$\nT = 90\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nSo, the new length is:\n$$\nS' = (0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{min}) \\times (90\\,\\mathrm{min}) = 36\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $S' = 36.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe two numerical values to be reported are the original somite length, $72.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and the new length under reduced velocity, $36.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 72.0 & 36.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2680037"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, morphogenesis is executed by the coordinated movement of individual cells.
