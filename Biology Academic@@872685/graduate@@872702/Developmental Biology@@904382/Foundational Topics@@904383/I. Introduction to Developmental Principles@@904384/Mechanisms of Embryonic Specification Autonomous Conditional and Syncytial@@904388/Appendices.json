The problem is valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the minimum injected volume, $v_{\\min}$, required to ensure the free concentration of a cytoplasmic determinant, $C_{\\text{free}}$, remains at or above a threshold, $T$, for a duration $\\tau$ after injection.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial condition at time $t=0$. The total amount of determinant introduced into the recipient region is the product of the injected volume, $v$, and the donor concentration, $C_{d}$. This amount is instantaneously mixed into the recipient volume, $V$. Since the problem states $v \\ll V$, the total volume is approximately constant at $V$. The initial total concentration of the determinant, $C_{\\text{tot}}(0)$, is therefore:\n$$C_{\\text{tot}}(0) = \\frac{v C_{d}}{V}$$\n\nNext, we model the change in the total determinant concentration over time. The problem states that the total determinant (both free and bound) degrades via a first-order process with rate constant $k$. This is described by the differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dC_{\\text{tot}}(t)}{dt} = -k C_{\\text{tot}}(t)$$\nThe solution to this first-order linear ordinary differential equation, with the initial condition $C_{\\text{tot}}(0)$, is:\n$$C_{\\text{tot}}(t) = C_{\\text{tot}}(0) \\exp(-kt) = \\frac{v C_{d}}{V} \\exp(-kt)$$\n\nThe bioactive determinant is the free form, $C_{\\text{free}}$. Its concentration is related to the total concentration, $C_{\\text{tot}}$, through a rapid binding equilibrium with a binding partner. Let $C$, $B$, and $CB$ represent the free determinant, free binding partner, and the complex, respectively. Their concentrations are denoted $C_{\\text{free}}$, $B_{\\text{free}}$, and $[CB]$. The equilibrium is governed by the law of mass action with dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{C_{\\text{free}} B_{\\text{free}}}{[CB]}$$\nConservation of mass for the determinant and its binding partner gives two additional equations:\n$$C_{\\text{tot}} = C_{\\text{free}} + [CB]$$\n$$B_{\\text{tot}} = B_{\\text{free}} + [CB]$$\nwhere $B_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total concentration of the binding partner.\n\nWe can solve this system of three equations to relate $C_{\\text{tot}}$ to $C_{\\text{free}}$.

Therefore, the condition $C_{\\text{free}}(t) \\ge T$ is most difficult to satisfy at the end of the time interval, $t=\\tau$. The requirement simplifies to satisfying the inequality at this single time point:\n$$C_{\\text{free}}(\\tau) \\ge T$$\n\nThe minimum injected volume, $v_{\\min}$, corresponds to the boundary case where the equality holds:\n$$C_{\\text{free}}(\\tau) = T$$\nWe can find the corresponding total concentration at time $\\tau$, which we will call $C_{\\text{tot}}^{*}$, by substituting $C_{\\text{free}} = T$ into our derived relationship:\n$$C_{\\text{tot}}^{*} = T \\frac{T + B_{\\text{tot}} + K_{d}}{T + K_{d}}$$\nThis is the minimum total concentration that must be present at time $t=\\tau$ to meet the specification criterion. Now, we relate this back to the injected volume $v$. The total concentration at time $\\tau$ is given by the degradation kinetics:\n$$C_{\\text{tot}}(\\tau) = \\frac{v C_{d}}{V} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\nFor the minimal volume $v_{\\min}$, we set $C_{\\text{tot}}(\\tau) = C_{\\text{tot}}^{*}$:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\min} C_{d}}{V} \\exp(-k\\tau) = T \\frac{T + B_{\\text{tot}} + K_{d}}{T + K_{d}}$$\nFinally, we solve for $v_{\\min}$:\n$$v_{\\min} C_{d} = V T \\frac{T + B_{\\text{tot}} + K_{d}}{T + K_{d}} \\exp(k\\tau)$$\n$$v_{\\min} = \\frac{V}{C_{d}} T \\frac{T + B_{\\text{tot}} + K_{d}}{T + K_{d}} \\exp(k\\tau)$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the minimal injected volume.

We derive each term separately.\n\nFirst, we find the variance of the positional estimate. The nucleus reduces measurement noise by averaging information over both time and space. The number of effective independent samples, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the product of the number of independent temporal samples, $N_t$, and the number of independent spatial samples, $N_s$.\nThe number of independent temporal samples collected over a duration $T$ with correlation time $\\tau_c$ is given as $N_t = T/\\tau_c$.\nThe number of independent spatial samples from neighboring regions is given as $N_s = S = 1 + 2 \\lambda/a$.\nThus, the total number of effective independent samples is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{eff}} = N_t N_s = S \\frac{T}{\\tau_c}$$\nThe variance of a single concentration measurement is $\\sigma_0^2$. The variance of an average of $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ independent measurements, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{avg}}^2$, is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{avg}}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{S T/\\tau_c} = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{S T}$$\nThe problem states that the position is inferred by inverting the linear concentration-position relationship, $c(x) \\approx c_0 + g x$. Therefore, the variance of the positional estimate, $\\mathrm{Var}(x)$, is related to the variance of the concentration estimate by:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{avg}}^2}{g^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{g^2 S T}$$\nThis is the variance term of the error, which decreases as the averaging time $T$ increases.\n\nNext, we address the bias term. The morphogen profile drifts at a speed $u$. Averaging over a time window $T$ while the profile moves results in a systematic error. The problem states this positional bias has a magnitude proportional to $uT/2$. For a linear gradient, this is an exact relationship, not merely a proportionality. The bias is the average displacement over the window, so the magnitude of the positional bias is $|b(T)| = uT/2$. The squared bias is:\n$$[\\mathrm{Bias}(x)]^2 = \\left(\\frac{uT}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{u^2 T^2}{4}$$\nThis term grows with the averaging time $T$.\n\nThe total mean-squared positional error $E(T)$ is the sum of the variance and the squared bias:\n$$E(T) = \\mathrm{Var}(x) + [\\mathrm{Bias}(x)]^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{g^2 S T} + \\frac{u^2 T^2}{4}$$\n\nTo find the optimal integration time $T^{\\ast}$ that minimizes $E(T)$, we compute the derivative of $E(T)$ with respect to $T$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{g^2 S} T^{-1} + \\frac{u^2}{4} T^2 \\right) = -\\frac{\\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{g^2 S} T^{-2} + \\frac{u^2}{2} T$$\nSetting $\\frac{dE}{dT} = 0$ at $T = T^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\frac{u^2 T^{\\ast}}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{g^2 S (T^{\\ast})^2}$$\nSolving for $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$(T^{\\ast})^3 = \\frac{2 \\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{g^2 S u^2}$$\n$$T^{\\ast} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{g^2 S u^2} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nThe second derivative, $\\frac{d^2E}{dT^2} = \\frac{2\\sigma_0^2 \\tau_c}{g^2 S T^3} + \\frac{u^2}{2}$, is strictly positive for $T > 0$, confirming that $T^{\\ast}$ corresponds to a minimum.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of spatially-averaged neighborhoods $S$:\n$$S = 1 + \\frac{2\\lambda}{a} = 1 + \\frac{2 \\times 12\\,\\text{µm}}{8\\,\\text{µm}} = 1 + \\frac{24}{8} = 1 + 3 = 4$$\nNext, we calculate the optimal averaging time $T^{\\ast}$ using the given parameter values:\n- $\\sigma_0^2 = (0.10\\,\\text{nM})^2 = 0.01\\,\\text{nM}^2$\n- $\\tau_c = 10\\,\\text{s}$\n- $g^2 = (0.02\\,\\text{nM/µm})^2 = 0.0004\\,\\text{nM}^2/\\text{µm}^2 = 4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{nM}^2/\\text{µm}^2$\n- $u^2 = (0.005\\,\\text{µm/s})^2 = 0.000025\\,\\text{µm}^2/\\text{s}^2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{µm}^2/\\text{s}^2$\n- $S = 4$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$T^{\\ast} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\times (0.01\\,\\text{nM}^2) \\times (10\\,\\text{s})}{(4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{nM}^2/\\text{µm}^2) \\times 4 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{µm}^2/\\text{s}^2)} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n$$T^{\\ast} = \\left( \\frac{0.2}{ (16 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-9})} \\right)^{1/3} \\text{s} = \\left( \\frac{0.2}{40 \\times 10^{-9}} \\right)^{1/3} \\text{s} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-1}}{4 \\times 10^{-8}} \\right)^{1/3} \\text{s}$$\n$$T^{\\ast} = (0.5 \\times 10^7)^{1/3} \\text{s} = (5 \\times 10^6)^{1/3} \\text{s} \\approx 170.9976\\,\\text{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $T^{\\ast} \\approx 171\\,\\text{s}$.\n\nNow, we determine the achievable optimal time $T_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ for each nuclear cycle, defined as $T_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\min\\{T^{\\ast},\\, T_{\\mathrm{NC}}\\}$.\n\nFor Nuclear Cycle 12 (NC12), $T_{\\mathrm{NC,12}} = 150\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{opt,12}} = \\min\\{170.9976\\,\\text{s}, 150\\,\\text{s}\\} = 150\\,\\text{s}$$\nThe system is limited by the short duration of the interphase.\n\nFor Nuclear Cycle 13 (NC13), $T_{\\mathrm{NC,13}} = 600\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{opt,13}} = \\min\\{170.9976\\,\\text{s}, 600\\,\\text{s}\\} = 170.9976\\,\\text{s}$$\nThe interphase duration is long enough to achieve the true optimum.
