A conditional null allele is used, denoted here as $k$. The wild-type allele is denoted as $K$.\n- An intercross of two heterozygous mice ($Kk \\times Kk$) is performed.\n- Under Mendel’s law of segregation, an intercross of two heterozygotes yields genotype frequencies of $1:2:1$ for $KK:Kk:kk$ among viable progeny.\n- The phenotype of interest is situs inversus.\n- Progeny with genotype $KK$ (wild-type homozygote) or $Kk$ (heterozygote) have a probability of situs inversus stated to be negligible, effectively $0$.\n- Progeny with genotype $kk$ (homozygous mutant) are viable.\n- The penetrance of situs inversus in homozygous mutants ($kk$) is $0.60$. Penetrance is defined as the conditional probability of expressing a phenotype given a genotype.\n- It is assumed there is equal fertility and no transmission ratio distortion.\n- The task is to compute the expected frequency of progeny exhibiting situs inversus in the total live-born litter and express it as a decimal fraction.\n\nStep 2: Validation of the Problem Statement.\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of Mendelian genetics and developmental biology. The gene *Kif3a* is indeed critical for cilia function, and its disruption is a well-documented cause of laterality defects, including situs inversus, in mouse models. The concepts of conditional alleles, Cre-Lox recombination (implied by \"Cre-driver background\"), penetrance, and Mendelian ratios are fundamental to modern genetics. The problem is scientifically sound and realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information to arrive at a unique solution. The genotypes of the parents are given ($Kk \\times Kk$), the expected genotype frequencies of progeny are defined ($1:2:1$), and the penetrance for each genotype is specified ($0$ for $KK$ and $Kk$, $0.60$ for $kk$). The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language without ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, completely specified, and objective.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the law of total probability. The overall expected frequency of a phenotype in a population is the sum of the conditional probabilities of that phenotype for each genotype, weighted by the frequency of each genotype.\n\nLet $SI$ represent the event that a progeny mouse exhibits situs inversus. The possible genotypes for the progeny of a $Kk \\times Kk$ intercross are $KK$, $Kk$, and $kk$. The expected frequency of situs inversus, denoted $P(SI)$, is given by the formula:\n$$P(SI) = P(SI | KK) \\cdot P(KK) + P(SI | Kk) \\cdot P(Kk) + P(SI | kk) \\cdot P(kk)$$\n\nFirst, we establish the probabilities of each genotype, $P(KK)$, $P(Kk)$, and $P(kk)$. According to the problem statement, a $Kk \\times Kk$ intercross yields progeny in a $1:2:1$ ratio for genotypes $KK:Kk:kk$. The total number of parts in this ratio is $1+2+1 = 4$. Therefore, the probabilities for each genotype are:\n$$P(KK) = \\frac{1}{1+2+1} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\n$$P(Kk) = \\frac{2}{1+2+1} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5$$\n$$P(kk) = \\frac{1}{1+2+1} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\n\nNext, we establish the conditional probabilities of situs inversus given each genotype. These are the penetrance values provided in the problem.\n- For wild-type homozygotes ($KK$): $P(SI | KK) = 0$.\n- For heterozygotes ($Kk$): $P(SI | Kk) = 0$.\n- For homozygous mutants ($kk$): $P(SI | kk) = 0.60$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the law of total probability:\n$$P(SI) = (0) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{4}) + (0) \\cdot (\\frac{2}{4}) + (0.60) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{4})$$\n\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$P(SI) = 0 + 0 + 0.60 \\cdot 0.25$$\n$$P(SI) = 0.15$$\n\nThus, the expected frequency of progeny exhibiting situs inversus in the total live-born litter is $0.15$.

The probability of a live-born founder being non-edited, $P(W | S)$.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is assessed for validity.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is set in a realistic context of developmental biology and genetic engineering in a model organism (*Mus musculus*).

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, complete, and mathematically solvable using foundational principles as requested.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires a solution based on first principles of probability and expectation.\n\nLet $N = 40$ be the total number of injected embryos. For each embryo, let $S$ denote the event of survival to term, and $M$ denote the event of being a mosaic founder.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected number of mosaic founders.\nLet $X_{mosaic}$ be the random variable representing the total number of mosaic founders in the cohort of $N$ embryos. We can express $X_{mosaic}$ as a sum of indicator random variables. For each embryo $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, let $I_i$ be an indicator variable such that:\n$$\nI_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if embryo } i \\text{ becomes a mosaic founder} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of mosaic founders is the sum of these indicators:\n$$X_{mosaic} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected number of mosaic founders is the sum of the expectations of the individual indicator variables:\n$$E[X_{mosaic}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[I_i]$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[I_i] = P(I_i = 1)$.\nThe event $I_i = 1$ occurs if and only if embryo $i$ survives to term AND is mosaic. This is the intersection of events $S_i$ and $M_i$. Using the definition of conditional probability, we can find the probability of this joint event:\n$$P(I_i = 1) = P(S_i \\cap M_i) = P(M_i | S_i) \\cdot P(S_i)$$\nWe are given the values $P(S_i) = 0.6$ and $P(M_i | S_i) = 0.5$. Since the outcomes are identical for all embryos, this probability is the same for all $i$.\n$$P(I_i = 1) = 0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.3$$\nTherefore, the expectation of each indicator is $E[I_i] = 0.3$.\nSince all embryos are subject to the same probabilities, $E[I_1] = E[I_2] = \\dots = E[I_N] = 0.3$.\nThe expected total number of mosaic founders is:\n$$E[X_{mosaic}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{40} E[I_i] = N \\cdot E[I_1] = 40 \\times 0.3 = 12$$\n\nSecond, we compute the genotype distribution among live-born founders. This requires calculating conditional probabilities, where the condition is that a founder is \"live-born\" (i.e., has survived to term).\nThe first required probability is the probability of being mosaic, given that the founder is live-born. This is precisely the conditional probability $P(M | S)$. The problem statement explicitly provides this value:\n$$P(\\text{mosaic} \\mid \\text{live-born}) = P(M | S) = 0.5$$\nThe second required probability is for the founder to be non-edited (wild-type, $W$), given that it is live-born. This is $P(W | S)$. The problem states that conditional on survival, a founder is either mosaic or non-edited. These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories for the set of live-born founders. Therefore, the sum of their conditional probabilities must be $1$:\n$$P(M | S) + P(W | S) = 1$$\nWe can solve for $P(W | S)$:\n$$P(W | S) = 1 - P(M | S) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\nThus, the genotype distribution among live-born founders is $50\\%$ mosaic-edited and $50\\%$ non-edited.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a single row vector containing the three computed values in the specified order: $[E(\\text{mosaic founders}), P(\\text{mosaic}\\mid \\text{live-born}), P(\\text{non-edited}\\mid \\text{live-born})]$.\nThe values are $12$, $0.5$, and $0.5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2655565"}, {"introduction": "The formation of complex tissues is often orchestrated by morphogen gradients that provide positional information to cells.

In a one-dimensional reduction along coordinate $x$, assume steady state and that the tissue extends effectively to infinity in both directions. Let the concentration of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) be $C(x)$, the effective diffusion coefficient be $D$, the first-order clearance rate be $k$, and a localized point source at $x=0$ inject a net source strength $S$. Starting from Fick’s law of diffusion and conservation of mass, the steady-state equation for $C(x)$ is:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}} - k\\, C + S\\, \\delta(x) = 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta distribution.

It is a standard-form reaction-diffusion problem used to model morphogen gradients, a fundamental concept in developmental biology. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nFirst, we address the justification of the model components and the physical interpretation of the parameters, as requested. The problem describes the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$ of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a morphogen, in a one-dimensional tissue.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}} - k\\, C + S\\, \\delta(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThe terms are justified as follows:\n1.  **Diffusion term**: The term $D \\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}}$ originates from Fick's second law of diffusion. It models the passive transport of Shh molecules through the extracellular space, driven by concentration gradients. The constant $D$ is the effective diffusion coefficient.\n2.  **Clearance term**: The term $-kC$ represents the removal of Shh from the system. It is modeled as a first-order process, meaning the rate of removal is directly proportional to the local concentration $C(x)$. Physiologically, this corresponds to mechanisms such as receptor-mediated endocytosis by target cells or enzymatic degradation. The constant $k$ is the first-order rate constant for clearance.\n3.  **Source term**: The term $S\\delta(x)$ models the localized production of Shh at the organizing center, located at $x=0$. The Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta(x)$, is a mathematical idealization for a source that is infinitesimally small in space. The constant $S$ is the source strength, representing the total rate at which Shh is injected into the system.\n\nThe physical dimensions of the parameters in this 1D model are determined by ensuring dimensional homogeneity in the governing equation. Let $[L]$ be length, $[T]$ be time, and $[M]$ be the amount of substance.\n-   Concentration $C(x)$ is amount per unit length: $[C] = [M][L]^{-1}$.\n-   The term $D \\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}}$ must have dimensions of concentration change per time, $[M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-1}$. Therefore, $[D] \\frac{[M][L]^{-1}}{[L]^2} = [M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-1}$, which gives the dimensions of the diffusion coefficient as $[D] = [L]^2[T]^{-1}$.\n-   The term $kC$ must also have dimensions of concentration change per time. Thus, $[k][M][L]^{-1} = [M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-1}$, which means the clearance rate constant has dimensions $[k] = [T]^{-1}$.\n-   The term $S\\delta(x)$ must also have dimensions $[M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-1}$. Since the Dirac delta $\\delta(x)$ has dimensions of inverse length, $[L]^{-1}$, the source strength must have dimensions $[S] = [M][T]^{-1}$, which represents an amount per unit time (a flux).\n\nNow, we solve the differential equation. For any position $x \\neq 0$, the source term is zero, and the equation becomes a homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}} - kC = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{k}{D} C = 0\n$$\nLet us define a characteristic length scale $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} C = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 - 1/\\lambda^2 = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm 1/\\lambda$. The general solution for $x \\neq 0$ is a linear combination of exponential functions:\n$$\nC(x) = A_1 e^{x/\\lambda} + A_2 e^{-x/\\lambda}\n$$\nWe must apply the boundary conditions, $C(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. This requires us to consider the regions $x > 0$ and $x < 0$ separately.\n-   For $x > 0$, as $x \\to \\infty$, the term $e^{x/\\lambda}$ diverges. For the solution to vanish, its coefficient must be zero, so $A_1 = 0$. The solution for $x > 0$ is $C(x) = C_+ e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n-   For $x < 0$, as $x \\to -\\infty$, the term $e^{-x/\\lambda}$ diverges. For the solution to vanish, its coefficient must be zero, so $A_2 = 0$. The solution for $x < 0$ is $C(x) = C_- e^{x/\\lambda}$.\n\nSo, the solution has the form:\n$$\nC(x) = \\begin{cases}\nC_- e^{x/\\lambda} & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\\nC_+ e^{-x/\\lambda} & \\text{if } x > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe concentration profile must be continuous at the origin, $x=0$. Thus, $C(0^-) = C(0^+)$, which implies $C_- e^0 = C_+ e^0$, or $C_- = C_+$. Let us denote this common constant by $A$. The solution can then be written more compactly using the absolute value function:\n$$\nC(x) = A e^{-|x|/\\lambda}\n$$\nTo determine the constant $A$, we integrate the full governing equation over an infinitesimal interval $[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon]$ around the origin and take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\left( D \\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}} - kC + S\\delta(x) \\right) dx = 0\n$$\n$$\nD \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^{2} C}{dx^{2}} dx - k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx + S \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x) dx = 0\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\nD \\left[ \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right]_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} - k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx + S \\cdot 1 = 0\n$$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the integral $\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx \\to 0$ because $C(x)$ is continuous and bounded. The first term represents a jump in the derivative of $C(x)$ at $x=0$. This leads to the jump condition:\n$$\nD \\left( \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^+} - \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^-} \\right) + S = 0\n$$\nWe compute the derivatives from our solution $C(x) = A e^{-|x|/\\lambda}$:\n-   For $x > 0$, $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{A}{\\lambda} e^{-x/\\lambda}$, so $\\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^+} = -\\frac{A}{\\lambda}$.\n-   For $x < 0$, $\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{A}{\\lambda} e^{x/\\lambda}$, so $\\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^-} = \\frac{A}{\\lambda}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the jump condition:\n$$\nD \\left( -\\frac{A}{\\lambda} - \\frac{A}{\\lambda} \\right) + S = 0\n$$\n$$\nD \\left( -\\frac{2A}{\\lambda} \\right) + S = 0 \\implies S = \\frac{2AD}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSolving for $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{S\\lambda}{2D}\n$$\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{S}{2D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} = \\frac{S \\sqrt{D}}{2D \\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $A$ and the definition of $\\lambda$ back into the solution $C(x) = A e^{-|x|/\\lambda}$:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\sqrt{D/k}}\\right) = \\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-|x|\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the steady-state concentration profile of Shh.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-|x|\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2655564"}]}
