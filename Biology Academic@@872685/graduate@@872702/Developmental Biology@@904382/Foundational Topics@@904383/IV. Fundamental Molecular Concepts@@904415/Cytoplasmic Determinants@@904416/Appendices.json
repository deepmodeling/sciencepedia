We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficient of variation, $\\text{CV}_X$, of the random variable $X$, which represents the number of cytoplasmic determinant molecules inherited by a specific daughter cell, Daughter A. The total number of molecules is $N$. Each of the $N$ molecules enters Daughter A independently with a probability $p$.\n\nLet us first model the random variable $X$. We can define $N$ independent indicator random variables, $X_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, where each $X_i$ corresponds to the fate of the $i$-th molecule.\nLet $X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th molecule enters Daughter A, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise.\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability of a \"success\" (the molecule entering Daughter A) is $P(X_i = 1) = p$. Consequently, the probability of \"failure\" is $P(X_i = 0) = 1-p$.\nThese are Bernoulli trials.\n\nThe total number of molecules in Daughter A, $X$, is the sum of these individual indicator variables:\n$$X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nThis formulation correctly identifies $X$ as a binomially distributed random variable, $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$.
