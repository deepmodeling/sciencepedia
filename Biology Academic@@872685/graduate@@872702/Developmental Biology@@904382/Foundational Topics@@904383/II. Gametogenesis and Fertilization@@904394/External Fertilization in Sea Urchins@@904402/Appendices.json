The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, and contains no subjective or ambiguous language. It is a self-contained, solvable problem in applied probability theory, requiring a derivation from first principles rather than the recall of a standard formula. The numerical values provided are physically plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the probability of at least one event occurring in the interval $[0, t]$ for a process governed by the specified axioms. This is a classic derivation for a Poisson process. Let $N(t)$ be the random variable representing the number of sperm arrivals in the time interval $(0, t]$. The probability of $k$ arrivals in this interval is denoted by $P_k(t) = \\Pr\\{N(t)=k\\}$.\n\nThe goal is to find $\\Pr\\{N(t) \\ge 1\\}$. It is more direct to first compute the probability of zero arrivals, $P_0(t) = \\Pr\\{N(t)=0\\}$, and then use the complement rule: $\\Pr\\{N(t) \\ge 1\\} = 1 - P_0(t)$.\n\nWe will derive a differential equation for $P_0(t)$. Consider the probability of no arrivals in the interval $(0, t+\\Delta t]$, which is $P_0(t+\\Delta t)$. For the event $\\{N(t+\\Delta t) = 0\\}$ to occur, there must be zero arrivals in the interval $(0, t]$ AND zero arrivals in the interval $(t, t+\\Delta t]$.\n\nDue to the property of independent increments, we can write:\n$$P_0(t+\\Delta t) = \\Pr\\{N(t)=0 \\text{ and } N(t+\\Delta t) - N(t) = 0\\} = \\Pr\\{N(t)=0\\} \\times \\Pr\\{N(t+\\Delta t) - N(t) = 0\\}$$\n\nDue to the property of stationary increments, the probability of zero arrivals in the interval $(t, t+\\Delta t]$ of length $\\Delta t$ is the same as the probability of zero arrivals in any interval of length $\\Delta t$, including $(0, \\Delta t]$. Therefore:\n$$\\Pr\\{N(t+\\Delta t) - N(t) = 0\\} = \\Pr\\{N(\\Delta t)=0\\} = P_0(\\Delta t)$$\n\nCombining these results, we get the relationship:\n$$P_0(t+\\Delta t) = P_0(t) P_0(\\Delta t)$$\n\nNext, we use the sparsity property to express $P_0(\\Delta t)$. The sum of probabilities for all possible numbers of arrivals in $(0, \\Delta t]$ must be $1$:\n$$\\Pr\\{N(\\Delta t)=0\\} + \\Pr\\{N(\\Delta t)=1\\} + \\Pr\\{N(\\Delta t) \\ge 2\\} = 1$$\nSubstituting the given infinitesimal probabilities:\n$$P_0(\\Delta t) + (\\lambda \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)) + o(\\Delta t) = 1$$\nSolving for $P_0(\\Delta t)$:\n$$P_0(\\Delta t) = 1 - \\lambda \\Delta t - o(\\Delta t)$$\nThe two $o(\\Delta t)$ terms are combined, as any sum of terms that are of smaller order than $\\Delta t$ is itself $o(\\Delta t)$.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $P_0(\\Delta t)$ back into our equation for $P_0(t+\\Delta t)$:\n$$P_0(t+\\Delta t) = P_0(t) (1 - \\lambda \\Delta t - o(\\Delta t))$$\nRearranging this equation to form a difference quotient:\n$$P_0(t+\\Delta t) - P_0(t) = -P_0(t) \\lambda \\Delta t - P_0(t) o(\\Delta t)$$\n$$\\frac{P_0(t+\\Delta t) - P_0(t)}{\\Delta t} = -\\lambda P_0(t) - P_0(t) \\frac{o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, the left side becomes the derivative $\\frac{d P_0(t)}{dt}$. By the definition of little-o notation, $\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t} = 0$. The equation thus becomes a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{d P_0(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda P_0(t)$$\n\nThis is a standard separable differential equation. The general solution is of the form $P_0(t) = C \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration. To find $C$, we must use an initial condition. At time $t=0$, the duration of the observation interval is zero, so the number of arrivals must be zero. Thus, the probability of zero arrivals at $t=0$ is $1$.\n$$P_0(0) = 1$$\nSubstituting this into the general solution:\n$$1 = C \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0) = C \\exp(0) = C \\cdot 1$$\nSo, the constant is $C=1$. The specific solution for the probability of zero arrivals by time $t$ is:\n$$P_0(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\n\nThe probability of at least one arrival, $\\Pr\\{N(t) \\ge 1\\}$, is the complement of zero arrivals:\n$$\\Pr\\{N(t) \\ge 1\\} = 1 - P_0(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis concludes the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe final step is to evaluate this expression for the provided parameters: sperm arrival rate $\\lambda = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and exposure duration $t = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe argument of the exponential function is the dimensionless quantity $\\lambda t$:\n$$\\lambda t = (0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 2$$\nSubstituting this value into the derived probability expression:\n$$\\Pr\\{\\text{at least one arrival}\\} = 1 - \\exp(-2)$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the probability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - \\exp(-2)}\n$$", "id": "2637467"}, {"introduction": "Upon successful fusion with a single sperm, the egg is in a race against time to prevent polyspermy—a lethal condition caused by multiple fertilizations.

Consider an experiment in which unfertilized eggs are microinjected with 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), a fast $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelator, at a concentration sufficient to delay the rise of free cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ but not to prevent the first sperm–egg fusion.

The analysis must be grounded in the provided biological principles and quantitative model.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in calculating the probability of an event occurring within a specific time window, governed by a Poisson process. The probability of polyspermy is defined as the probability that at least one additional sperm-egg fusion event occurs in the interval between the end of the fast electrical block and the establishment of the slow mechanical block. Let $t=0$ be the time of the first sperm-egg fusion.\n\nThe fast block to polyspermy lasts for a duration $t_{\\mathrm{fast}}$. Therefore, it ends at time $t = t_{\\mathrm{fast}}$.\nThe slow block to polyspermy is established at the time of fertilization envelope elevation, which we will denote as $T_{\\mathrm{block}}$.\nThe \"window of vulnerability\" to polyspermy is the time interval $[t_{\\mathrm{fast}}, T_{\\mathrm{block}}]$, and its duration is $\\Delta t = T_{\\mathrm{block}} - t_{\\mathrm{fast}}$.\n\nAccording to foundational basis (iv), the arrival of additional sperm capable of fusing during this window is a Poisson process with a constant rate $r$. The expected number of fusion events, $\\lambda$, in the time interval $\\Delta t$ is given by $\\lambda = r \\cdot \\Delta t$.\nThe probability of observing $k$ events in this interval is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!}$$\nPolyspermy occurs if the number of additional fusions, $N$, is at least one ($N \\ge 1$). The probability of this is:\n$$P(\\text{polyspermy}) = P(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N=0)$$\nUsing the Poisson distribution, $P(N=0) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^0}{0!} = e^{-\\lambda}$.\nTherefore, the probability of polyspermy is:\n$$P(\\text{polyspermy}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda} = 1 - e^{-r \\cdot (T_{\\mathrm{block}} - t_{\\mathrm{fast}})}$$\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the two specified conditions: control and BAPTA-injected.\n\n**1.

BAPTA-Injected Condition:**\nBAPTA is a $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelator that delays the cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ rise by $\\tau = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The problem states that envelope elevation is triggered by this rise. Therefore, the new time of envelope elevation is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} = T_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} + \\tau = 30\\,\\mathrm{s} + 20\\,\\mathrm{s} = 50\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe fast block is unaffected by intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (Basis (iii)), so $t_{\\mathrm{fast}}$ remains $1\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The sperm fusion rate $r$ is also stated to be independent of intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (Basis (iv)), so it remains $0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe duration of the vulnerability window in the presence of BAPTA is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} = T_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} - t_{\\mathrm{fast}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{s} - 1\\,\\mathrm{s} = 49\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe expected number of fusion events is $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} = r \\cdot \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\cdot 49\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.98$.\nThe probability of polyspermy in the BAPTA-injected case is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} = 1 - e^{-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}}} = 1 - e^{-0.98} \\approx 1 - 0.3753 = 0.6247$$\nThis value is approximately $0.63$.\n\nThe injection of BAPTA delays the slow block, extending the window of vulnerability from $29\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to $49\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and thereby increases the probability of polyspermy from approximately $0.44$ to $0.63$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. BAPTA prevents envelope elevation altogether, but polyspermy remains rare because the fast electrical block suffices to exclude additional sperm; therefore the probability of polyspermy is unchanged from control.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The problem explicitly states that BAPTA delays, not prevents, envelope elevation: \"$T_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} = T_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} + \\tau$\". Furthermore, the fast block is very short-lived ($t_{\\mathrm{fast}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$) and our calculation shows it does not suffice to prevent polyspermy. The probability of polyspermy is shown to increase, not remain unchanged. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. BAPTA delays envelope elevation by approximately $\\tau$, leaving the fast electrical block intact; consequently, the probability of polyspermy increases from approximately $1 - e^{-r\\,(T_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} - t_{\\mathrm{fast}})} \\approx 0.44$ in control to approximately $1 - e^{-r\\,(T_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} - t_{\\mathrm{fast}})} \\approx 0.63$ after BAPTA.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivation. BAPTA delays elevation by $\\tau$ (from $30\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to $50\\,\\mathrm{s}$), and the fast block is intact. The calculated probabilities for control ($P_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} \\approx 0.44$) and BAPTA ($P_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 0.63$) match the values provided in the option. All parts of this statement are consistent with the problem's givens and our logical-mathematical derivation. **Correct**.\n\n**C. BAPTA accelerates envelope elevation because $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ buffering prevents store-dependent delays, thereby reducing the probability of polyspermy from approximately $0.44$ to approximately $0.10$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The problem states that BAPTA, by chelating $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, *delays* the calcium rise and thus *delays* envelope elevation. It does not accelerate it. The premise of this option contradicts the given information. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. BAPTA delays envelope elevation, but because intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ buffering reduces sperm–egg fusion rate $r$, the probability of polyspermy decreases relative to control despite the delay in envelope elevation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While it correctly states that BAPTA delays envelope elevation, it incorrectly claims that $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ buffering reduces the fusion rate $r$. Foundational basis (iv) explicitly states that the sperm fusion rate $r$ is \"independent of the egg’s intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$\".

This yields a system of two non-linear, transcendental equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nf(t_1) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta - \\alpha} \\left( e^{-\\alpha c_s t_1} - e^{-\\beta c_s t_1} \\right) \\\\\nf(t_2) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta - \\alpha} \\left( e^{-\\alpha c_s t_2} - e^{-\\beta c_s t_2} \\right)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nDue to the non-linearity, an analytical solution is not feasible. We must employ a numerical root-finding algorithm. To enforce the constraint $\\beta > \\alpha > 0$ and improve numerical stability, we perform a change of variables: let $u = \\alpha$ and $v = \\beta - \\alpha$. The constraints then become $u > 0$ and $v > 0$. The system in terms of $u$ and $v$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nF_1(u, v) = \\frac{u+v}{v} \\left( e^{-u c_s t_1} - e^{-(u+v) c_s t_1} \\right) - f(t_1) = 0 \\\\\nF_2(u, v) = \\frac{u+v}{v} \\left( e^{-u c_s t_2} - e^{-(u+v) c_s t_2} \\right) - f(t_2) = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis system can be solved for $(u, v)$ using a numerical solver, such as `scipy.optimize.root`. A good initial guess is crucial for convergence. We can deduce approximate values for the parameters by analyzing the properties of the function $f(t)$ and the given data for each case. Once the solver finds a valid solution $(u^*, v^*)$, we transform back to the original parameters: $\\alpha = u^*$ and $\\beta = u^* + v^*$. The final values are then rounded to six significant digits as required.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a Python script that iterates through each test case, sets up the system of equations with the specific parameters, solves for $(u, v)$ using an informed initial guess, converts the results back to $(\\beta, \\alpha)$, rounds them appropriately, and formats the collected results into the specified output string.", "answer": "[[1.63457e-05,1.34568e-06],[1.60000e-05,8.00000e-07],[6.30000e-06,4.50000e-06]]", "id": "2637472"}]}
