It is therefore valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, which consists of two tasks.\n\nFirst, we compute the total amount of protease, in moles, released into the perivitelline space upon cortical granule exocytosis.\nThe given data are:\nNumber of cortical granules per egg, $N_{CG} = 1.5 \\times 10^{4}$.\nProtease content per granule, $n_{CG} = 0.1 \\, \\text{fmol} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{mol}$.\n\nThe total number of moles of protease, $N_{total}$, is the product of the number of granules and the moles per granule:\n$$N_{total} = N_{CG} \\times n_{CG}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{total} = (1.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (0.1 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{mol}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{mol}$$\n\nSecond, we derive a dimensionless group that compares the rate of surface reaction to the rate of diffusive supply and compute its value.

Let $C_0$ be the characteristic concentration of protease at the source of diffusion (the egg plasma membrane at $x=0$).\n\nThe characteristic rate of diffusive supply, $J_{diff, char}$, is the maximum possible flux across the layer of thickness $L$. This maximum flux occurs under the steepest possible concentration gradient, which happens when the reaction is infinitely fast, consuming all protease upon arrival, such that $C(L)=0$. The gradient is then approximately $\\frac{\\Delta C}{L} = \\frac{C_0 - 0}{L} = \\frac{C_0}{L}$. The characteristic diffusive flux is:\n$$J_{diff, char} = D \\frac{C_0}{L}$$\n\nThe characteristic rate of surface reaction, $J_{rxn, char}$, is the maximum possible reaction rate. This occurs when diffusion is infinitely fast, such that there is no concentration depletion at the reactive surface, i.e., $C(L) = C_0$. The characteristic reactive flux is:\n$$J_{rxn, char} = k C_0$$\n\nThe dimensionless group, which we denote by $\\Phi$, is the ratio of the characteristic reaction rate to the characteristic diffusion rate:\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{J_{rxn, char}}{J_{diff, char}} = \\frac{k C_0}{D \\frac{C_0}{L}} = \\frac{kL}{D}$$\nThis number, a form of the Damköhler number, compares the timescale of diffusion ($\\tau_{diff} \\sim L^2/D$) to the timescale of reaction ($\\tau_{rxn} \\sim L/k$).\n\nThe criterion for determining the rate-limiting step is based on the magnitude of $\\Phi$:\n- If $\\Phi \\gg 1$, the characteristic reaction rate is much greater than the characteristic diffusion rate.

Patch-clamp recordings of fertilization potentials show that control eggs depolarize from a resting potential of approximately $-70 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to a peak of approximately $+20 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ within approximately $1 \\,\\mathrm{s}$ of the first sperm-egg fusion. In an experimental condition, the fertilization potential exhibits a reduced peak amplitude of approximately $+8 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ with similar kinetics.

The depolarization reduction indicates a primary failure of the slow block, while the electrical fast block remains effective; therefore early polyspermy probability is unchanged, but a late increase occurs after $T_{\\mathrm{slow}}$ because the electrical block eventually dissipates.\n\nC. The reduced fertilization potential diminishes the intracellular calcium wave driving cortical granule exocytosis; even if photometry appears normal, the slow block is functionally delayed, and the increased polyspermy is due to slow block failure rather than any electrical mechanism.\n\nD.

It provides a self-contained and consistent description of a biological phenomenon and poses a formalizable question. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to quantify the risk of polyspermy, which is the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm. This risk is determined by the duration of a \"vulnerable window\" during which additional sperm can fuse with the egg. The problem describes two mechanisms that close this window: the fast block and the slow block.\n\nThe probability of polyspermy is the probability of at least one additional sperm arrival and fusion during this vulnerable window. Sperm arrivals are modeled as a Poisson process with a constant rate $\\lambda = 0.1 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. For a vulnerable window of duration $\\Delta t$, the number of arriving sperm $N$ follows a Poisson distribution. The probability of zero sperm arrivals is $P(N=0) = e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t}$. The probability of at least one arrival, and thus polyspermy, is $P_{\\text{poly}} = P(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N=0) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t}$.\n\nWe must determine the duration of the vulnerable window, $\\Delta t$, for both the control and experimental conditions. The window begins at $t=0$ with the first sperm fusion and ends when a block to polyspermy becomes effective.\n\n**Control Condition Analysis:**\nIn the control case, the egg membrane potential depolarizes from a resting potential of approximately $-70 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to a peak of approximately $+20 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The fast block to polyspermy is established when the membrane potential, $V_m$, exceeds a threshold of $V_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx +13 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Since the peak potential ($+20 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is greater than the threshold ($+13 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the fast block is successful. The problem states that the peak is reached at approximately $t=1 \\,\\mathrm{s}$. The time to cross the threshold, $T_{\\mathrm{th}}$, will be slightly less than or approximately equal to $1 \\,\\mathrm{s}$. We can thus approximate the vulnerable window as $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{control}} \\approx T_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 1 \\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe probability of polyspermy in the control case is:\n$$P_{\\text{poly, control}} = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{control}}} \\approx 1 - e^{-(0.1 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1 \\,\\mathrm{s})} = 1 - e^{-0.1}$$\n$$P_{\\text{poly, control}} \\approx 1 - 0.9048 = 0.0952$$\n\n**Experimental Condition Analysis:**\nIn the experimental condition, the fertilization potential reaches a reduced peak of only $+8 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This peak potential is less than the required threshold for the fast block, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx +13 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Consequently, the condition $V_m > V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is never met, and the electrical fast block fails entirely.\nIn the absence of a functional fast block, the only remaining protection is the slow block. The problem states that photometric assays show the slow block begins at approximately $20 \\,\\mathrm{s}$ and is \"substantially completed by approximately $45 \\,\\mathrm{s}$\". The vulnerable window, therefore, extends from $t=0$ until the slow block becomes effective, a time we denote as $T_{\\mathrm{slow}}$. The duration of the vulnerable window is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{exp}} = T_{\\mathrm{slow}}$.\nThe probability of polyspermy in the experimental case is:\n$$P_{\\text{poly, exp}} = 1 - e^{-\\lambda T_{\\mathrm{slow}}}$$\nThe exact value of $T_{\\mathrm{slow}}$ is not specified but is given as a process occurring between $20 \\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $45 \\,\\mathrm{s}$. We will now evaluate the provided options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A.** This option states that the reduced potential ($+8 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is below the threshold ($+13 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$), causing the fast block to fail entirely. This is correct. It states that the vulnerable window expands from $T_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 1 \\,\\mathrm{s}$ in the control to $T_{\\mathrm{slow}}$ in the experiment. This is also correct. It then assumes a value of $T_{\\mathrm{slow}} \\approx 25 \\,\\mathrm{s}$, which is a plausible time for the slow block to become effective, given it starts at $20 \\,\\mathrm{s}$. Based on these premises, it calculates the probabilities of polyspermy.\nFor control: $P_{\\text{poly, control}} \\approx 1 - e^{-(0.1)(1)} = 1 - e^{-0.1} \\approx 0.095$. This calculation is correct.\nFor experimental: $P_{\\text{poly, exp}} \\approx 1 - e^{-(0.1)(25)} = 1 - e^{-2.5} \\approx 0.918$. This calculation is also correct.\nThe concluding statement that the mechanism is a selective failure of the fast block with an intact slow block is a correct interpretation of the problem statement. Every part of this option's reasoning is logically and mathematically sound based on the givens and its own explicit assumption for $T_{\\mathrm{slow}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option claims the depolarization reduction indicates a failure of the slow block and that the fast block remains effective. This is a fundamental misinterpretation. The depolarization *is* the fast block mechanism. A reduced depolarization indicates a failure of the fast block, not the slow block. Furthermore, the data clearly show the fast block is not effective ($+8 \\,\\mathrm{mV} < +13 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$), and the slow block's kinetics are normal. This statement contradicts the problem's premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option speculates that the slow block is \"functionally delayed\" despite photometric data showing it is normal. While the initial depolarization is linked to the calcium wave that triggers the slow block, the problem provides direct observational evidence that the slow block is *not* delayed. One must base the solution on the data provided, not on contradicting it with hypotheses about underlying mechanisms. The problem asks for the contribution of the *fast block impairment*; this option incorrectly attributes the increased risk to a slow block failure, which is contrary to the supplied evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option claims that because the potential exceeds $0 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the fast block should be effective. This is false. The effectiveness of the block is determined by whether the potential exceeds the specific, given threshold of $V_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx +13 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The value of $0 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is arbitrary and irrelevant to the specified biological mechanism. Since $+8 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is less than $+13 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the fast block fails. The conclusion that the probability of fusions remains similar to control is therefore baseless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.** This option mischaracterizes the fast block as a mechanism that reduces sperm *binding* rather than *fusion*. The fast block prevents the fusion of the sperm and egg plasma membranes. This is the standard textbook understanding and is implied by the problem's description of rendering the egg \"refractory to additional sperm fusion.\" Based on this faulty premise, the option incorrectly concludes that the probability of fusions would not change substantially.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only option A provides a correct qualitative and quantitative analysis consistent with the problem statement. It correctly identifies the failure of the fast block, the resulting expansion of the vulnerable window, and performs the correct probability calculations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2682618"}]}
