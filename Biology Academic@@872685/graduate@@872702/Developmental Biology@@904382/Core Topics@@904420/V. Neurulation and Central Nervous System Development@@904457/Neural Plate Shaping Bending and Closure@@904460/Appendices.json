Consider a straight row of identical, columnar cells that collectively form a continuous epithelial strip of thickness $t$ (apico-basal direction) and unit extent along the longitudinal axis of the row (so all quantities are per unit length along the row). The average cell height is $h$, which sets the geometric scale relating apical shape change to apico-basal gradients.

It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics applied to biological tissues, and objective in its formulation. We will proceed to derive the expression for the bending moment based solely on the provided assumptions.\n\nThe objective is to derive the bending moment per unit length, $M$, generated by apical constriction. The problem defines $M$ as \"the first moment across the thickness of the in-plane force resultant\". This is interpreted as the moment generated by the active forces that drive the biophysical process. The unit of bending moment per unit length is force, which is correctly stated as Newtons ($N$).\n\nThe driving force for the bending is the active tension generated by the actomyosin cortex at the apical surface of the neuroepithelial cells. Let us denote this active tension, which is a force per unit length along the longitudinal axis of the cell row, as $T_a$. According to the problem statement, this tension is proportional to the apical in-plane strain, $\\varepsilon_a$. The relationship is given by:\n$$T_a = \\sigma_a \\varepsilon_a$$\nwhere $\\sigma_a$ is the effective apical contractility per unit strain, a given material parameter with units of force per unit length.\n\nThe apical in-plane strain, $\\varepsilon_a$, is defined as the fractional shortening of the apical surface relative to the basal surface. For small deformations, this is given by the approximation:\n$$\\varepsilon_a \\approx \\frac{\\Delta r}{h}$$\nHere, $\\Delta r$ represents the decrease in the apical half-width, and $h$ is the average cell height, which sets the geometric scale for the strain.\n\nBy substituting the expression for strain into the equation for tension, we obtain the magnitude of the active force per unit longitudinal length:\n$$T_a = \\sigma_a \\frac{\\Delta r}{h}$$\nThis force is generated by the contractile actomyosin cortex and is therefore localized at the apical surface of the epithelial strip.\n\nThe problem specifies a coordinate system for the calculation of the moment. The neutral axis of bending is located at $z=0$. The apical surface is located at $z = +\\frac{t}{2}$, where $t$ is the total thickness of the tissue. The basal surface is located at $z = -\\frac{t}{2}$. The problem also states that \"The basal surface bears no active pre-stress,\" which confirms that the active force generation is asymmetric and confined to the apical region.\n\nThe bending moment $M$ is the first moment of this active force about the designated neutral axis ($z=0$). The active force $T_a$ is applied at the apical surface, so its point of application is $z = +\\frac{t}{2}$. The lever arm for this force with respect to the neutral axis is therefore the distance from $z=0$ to $z=+\\frac{t}{2}$, which is $\\frac{t}{2}$.\n\nThe bending moment per unit length is the product of the force per unit length and the corresponding lever arm:\n$$M = T_a \\times \\left( \\frac{t}{2} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $T_a$:\n$$M = \\left( \\sigma_a \\frac{\\Delta r}{h} \\right) \\frac{t}{2}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to give the final closed-form result for the bending moment per unit length in terms of all the specified parameters: $\\sigma_a$, $\\Delta r$, $h$, and $t$.\n$$M = \\frac{\\sigma_a t \\Delta r}{2h}$$\nWe verify the physical units of the expression.

The structure is modeled as two piecewise-straight segments. The first segment, of projected length $x_d$, has a slope of $\\phi_{\\mathrm{M}}$.

It applies fundamental principles of classical mechanics—specifically, the Euler-Bernoulli theory for elastic bending—to a simplified yet informative model of a biological process, namely neural tube closure. All parameters and objectives are clearly defined. Therefore, we may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the equilibrium state of a stylized neural tissue flap and assess its closure potential. The state is defined by the tissue's curvature, $k$.\n\nFirst, we must find the equilibrium curvature $k$ by solving the provided nonlinear equation, which arises from the principle of static moment balance. The total bending moment $M$ at the hinge point is the sum of an intrinsic, configuration-independent moment $M_0$ and a moment $M_T$ generated by the horizontal traction force $T$ applied at the distal tip of the tissue. The elastic restoring moment of the tissue is given by the Euler-Bernoulli relation, $M_{elastic} = B\\,k$, where $B$ is the bending stiffness. At equilibrium, the sum of moments is zero. We are given the equilibrium as $M_{elastic} = M_0 + M_T$.\n\nThe moment from traction, $M_T$, is the product of the force $T$ and its lever arm, which is the vertical distance to the tip, $y_{\\mathrm{tip}}$. For a circular arc of radius $R = 1/k$ and length $L$, the tip's vertical position is $y_{\\mathrm{tip}} = R(1 - \\cos(kL))$. Thus, $M_T = T \\cdot \\frac{1}{k}(1 - \\cos(kL))$. Substituting this into the balance equation gives:\n$$\nB\\,k = M_0 + T\\,\\frac{1 - \\cos(k\\,L)}{k}\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $k$. To solve for $k$, we must employ a numerical root-finding algorithm. We can define a function $f(k)$ whose roots correspond to the equilibrium curvature:\n$$\nf(k) = B\\,k - M_0 - T\\,\\frac{1 - \\cos(k\\,L)}{k} = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we seek a non-trivial solution $k>0$ within the principal bending branch, $0 < k\\,L < \\pi$. Let us analyze the function $f(k)$ in this domain. For $k \\to 0$, using the Taylor series expansion $1 - \\cos(kL) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(kL)^2$, the final term behaves as $T \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(kL)^2 = T\\frac{L^2}{2}k$. Thus, $f(k) \\approx (B - T\\frac{L^2}{2})k - M_0$. As $k \\to 0$, $f(k) \\to -M_0$. Since all test cases have $M_0 \\ge 0$, we have $f(0^+) \\le 0$. At the upper end of the domain, $k = \\pi/L$, we have $f(\\pi/L) = B\\frac{\\pi}{L} - M_0 - T\\frac{1 - \\cos(\\pi)}{\\pi/L} = B\\frac{\\pi}{L} - M_0 - T\\frac{2L}{\\pi}$. For all given test cases, this value is positive. Since $f(k)$ is continuous on $(0, \\pi/L)$ and changes sign from non-positive near $0$ to positive at $\\pi/L$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one root. For the given physical parameters, the solution is unique in this interval. A robust numerical method, such as Brent's method, is an appropriate choice to find the root, as it combines the speed of interpolation methods with the reliability of the bisection method. We will use a search bracket such as $[10^{-10}, \\pi/L - 10^{-10}]$ to safely contain the root. A special case exists when $T=0$, where the equation becomes linear, $B\\,k = M_0$, yielding the analytic solution $k = M_0/B$.\n\nOnce the equilibrium curvature $k$ is computed for a given parameter set $(B, M_0, L, d_0, T)$, we proceed to the second stage of the analysis:\n\n1.  **Compute the closure margin, $m$, and indicator, $c$**:\n    The horizontal projection of the tissue flap (its chord length) is given by $x_{\\mathrm{tip}} = R\\sin(kL) = \\frac{\\sin(kL)}{k}$.\n    Closure is successful if this length reaches the midline, a distance $d_0$ from the hinge. The closure margin is defined as $m = \\frac{\\sin(kL)}{k} - d_0$. The closure indicator, $c$, is then determined: $c=1$ if $m \\ge 0$ and $c=0$ otherwise. For numerical stability, the term $\\frac{\\sin(kL)}{k}$ must be handled carefully for small $k$. Its limit as $k \\to 0$ is $L$. This can be robustly implemented using the sinc function, where $\\frac{\\sin(u)}{u}$ is computed.\n\n2.  **Compute the traction effect index, $e$**:\n    This requires comparison to a baseline case with no traction ($T=0$). For this baseline, the curvature is $k_0 = M_0/B$. The corresponding baseline closure margin is $m_0 = \\frac{\\sin(k_0 L)}{k_0} - d_0$. The effect index $e$ quantifies whether the traction $T$ helps ($e=1$), hinders ($e=-1$), or has a negligible effect ($e=0$) on the closure margin, compared to the baseline. This is determined by the sign of the difference $m - m_0$ relative to a small tolerance $\\varepsilon=10^{-8}$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for each test case is as follows:\n- Read the parameters $B, M_0, L, d_0, T$.\n- Solve for the equilibrium curvature $k$.
