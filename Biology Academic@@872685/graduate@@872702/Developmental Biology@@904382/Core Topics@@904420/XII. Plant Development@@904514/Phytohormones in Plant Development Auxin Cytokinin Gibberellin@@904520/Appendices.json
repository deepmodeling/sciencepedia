The problem is self-contained, formalizable, and does not violate any fundamental principles. It is a standard problem in quantitative biology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as specified by the task.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the receptor occupancy, $\\theta$.\nWe begin with the two fundamental equations provided: the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, and the conservation of total receptor sites, $R_T$.\n\nThe definition of the dissociation constant is:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} \\quad (1)$$\n\nThe conservation of receptor sites is:\n$$R_{T} = [R] + [RL] \\quad (2)$$\n\nFrom equation $(2)$, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, in terms of the total receptor concentration, $R_{T}$, and the occupied receptor concentration, $[RL]$:\n$$[R] = R_{T} - [RL] \\quad (3)$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ from equation $(3)$ into the definition of $K_{d}$ in equation $(1)$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(R_{T} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\n\nOur objective is to find an expression for the receptor occupancy, $\\theta \\equiv \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$. To achieve this, we must first solve for $[RL]$. We rearrange the equation algebraically:\n$$K_{d}[RL] = (R_{T} - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_{d}[RL] = R_{T}[L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_{d}[RL] + [RL][L] = R_{T}[L]$$\n$$[RL](K_{d} + [L]) = R_{T}[L]$$\n\nSolving for the concentration of the occupied receptor, $[RL]$, yields:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{R_{T}[L]}{K_{d} + [L]} \\quad (4)$$\n\nFinally, we use the definition of receptor occupancy, $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$, and substitute the expression for $[RL]$ from equation $(4)$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{R_{T}} \\left( \\frac{R_{T}[L]}{K_{d} + [L]} \\right)$$\n\nThe $R_{T}$ terms cancel, resulting in the final expression for receptor occupancy as a function of the free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$\\theta([L], K_{d}) = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nThis completes the derivation for the first part. This is the Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding.\n\nPart 2: Computation of $\\theta$ for specific concentrations.\nWe are given $K_{d} = 100$ nM. We will now compute $\\theta$ for the three specified concentrations of IAA, where $[L] = [\\mathrm{IAA}]$.\n\nCase (a): $[\\mathrm{IAA}] = 20$ nM.\nLet this occupancy be $\\theta_{1}$.\n$$\\theta_{1} = \\frac{20 \\text{ nM}}{100 \\text{ nM} + 20 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{20}{120} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nCase (b): $[\\mathrm{IAA}] = 100$ nM.\nLet this occupancy be $\\theta_{2}$.\n$$\\theta_{2} = \\frac{100 \\text{ nM}}{100 \\text{ nM} + 100 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{100}{200} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAs expected, when the ligand concentration is equal to the dissociation constant, the receptor is half-saturated.\n\nCase (c): $[\\mathrm{IAA}] = 500$ nM.\nLet this occupancy be $\\theta_{3}$.\n$$\\theta_{3} = \\frac{500 \\text{ nM}}{100 \\text{ nM} + 500 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{500}{600} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the fold-change in ARF activity.\nThe problem states that ARF activity, $A$, is proportional to the receptor occupancy, $\\theta$. This can be written as:\n$$A = c \\cdot \\theta$$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nWe need to find the fold-change in activity when $[\\mathrm{IAA}]$ increases from $20$ nM to $500$ nM. Let $A_{\\text{initial}}$ be the activity at $[\\mathrm{IAA}] = 20$ nM and $A_{\\text{final}}$ be the activity at $[\\mathrm{IAA}] = 500$ nM.\n\nThe initial activity is:\n$$A_{\\text{initial}} = c \\cdot \\theta_{1} = c \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nThe final activity is:\n$$A_{\\text{final}} = c \\cdot \\theta_{3} = c \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\nThe fold-change is defined as the ratio of the final activity to the initial activity:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{A_{\\text{final}}}{A_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\theta_{3}}{c \\cdot \\theta_{1}} = \\frac{\\theta_{3}}{\\theta_{1}}$$\n\nSubstituting the values calculated in Part 2:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{5/6}{1/6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{6}{1} = 5$$\n\nThe fold-change in ARF activity is $5$.

The Skoog–Miller model is a fundamental principle in plant tissue culture. The canonical two-component cytokinin signaling pathway, wherein Type-B ARRs act as primary positive regulators of transcriptional output, is a well-established fact in plant molecular biology. The *arr1 arr12* double mutant is a standard genetic tool used to study this pathway, and its phenotype of reduced cytokinin sensitivity is well-documented. The experimental setup described is a classic protocol for in vitro shoot regeneration. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and guiding principles to deduce a logical conclusion. There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution may be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires predicting the phenotype of an *arr1 arr12* mutant based on two core principles: the hormonal ratio effect (Skoog-Miller) and the molecular mechanism of cytokinin signal transduction.\n\n1.  According to the Skoog-Miller principle, the shift from a high auxin:cytokinin ratio ($10\\!:\\!1$) to a low one ($1\\!:\\!10$) provides the hormonal cue for shoot organogenesis. In a wild-type system, the high external cytokinin concentration is perceived by receptors at the cell surface.\n\n2.  This perception initiates the canonical two-component signaling phosphorelay cascade. The signal is transduced to the nucleus, leading to the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Type-B Arabidopsis Response Regulators (ARRs).\n\n3.  The problem explicitly states that Type-B ARRs, such as *ARR1* and *ARR12*, are **positive transcription factors**. Once activated, they bind to the promoters of cytokinin-responsive genes and drive their expression. These target genes include critical regulators of shoot apical meristem identity and formation, such as *WUSCHEL* (*WUS*).\n\n4.  In the *arr1 arr12* double mutant, two of the major positive regulators of the cytokinin response are absent or non-functional due to loss-of-function mutations.\n\n5.  Therefore, even when the callus is placed on a high-cytokinin medium ($1\\!:\\!10$ auxin:cytokinin), the signal cannot be effectively transduced into the required transcriptional output. The cellular machinery responsible for activating shoot-promoting genes is broken. The problem itself confirms this by stating that in this mutant, \"cytokinin transcriptional output is reduced\".\n\n6.  Consequently, the cells are functionally insensitive or, at best, strongly hyposensitive to the high-cytokinin signal. They fail to execute the developmental program for shoot formation. The most probable outcome is that the callus tissue will not undergo efficient shoot organogenesis. It is likely to either remain in an undifferentiated state or, given the blunted cytokinin response, the relative effect of the auxin still present in the medium might promote the alternative fate, which is rooting.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Robust and frequent de novo shoot formation comparable to wild type, because high cytokinin dominates regardless of signaling fidelity.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A biological signal is only effective if it can be perceived and transduced by a functional signaling pathway. High external hormone concentration is meaningless if the downstream machinery to interpret it is compromised. Signaling fidelity is not optional; it is essential. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Greatly reduced shoot regeneration; callus remains largely undifferentiated or adopts a rooty fate with occasional adventitious roots due to residual auxin, reflecting blunted cytokinin transcriptional output in the *arr1 arr12* mutant.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derived conclusion. The loss of *ARR1* and *ARR12* impairs the cytokinin transcriptional response, as stated. This \"blunted cytokinin transcriptional output\" directly leads to a failure in shoot regeneration. The subsequent possibilities—remaining as undifferentiated callus or forming roots due to the now relatively stronger influence of auxin—are the logical consequences of a blocked shoot-promoting signal. This option provides a correct and complete description of the expected phenotype. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\n**C. Hypersensitivity to cytokinin leading to supernumerary shoots, because removing *ARR1* and *ARR12* eliminates negative feedback on cytokinin signaling.**\nThis option confuses the roles of different classes of ARRs. Type-B ARRs are **positive regulators**. Their removal causes insensitivity (hyposensitivity), not hypersensitivity. Negative feedback in the cytokinin pathway is primarily mediated by Type-A ARRs, which are induced by Type-B ARRs. Removing the positive regulators (*ARR1* and *ARR12*) would prevent the induction of negative regulators, but the primary effect is the loss of the positive signal itself. The premise of this option is incorrect. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Rescue of shoot regeneration by endogenous gibberellin compensating for the loss of *ARR1* and *ARR12*, restoring near-normal shoot induction on 1:10 medium.**\nThe problem specifies that GA levels are constant and non-limiting, positioning GA as a controlled variable, not a compensating agent. While hormonal pathways exhibit cross-talk, there is no established principle suggesting that GA can functionally replace the core transcription factors of the cytokinin pathway in this direct manner. This is unsubstantiated speculation outside the framework provided. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Conversion to somatic embryogenesis upon the 1:10 shift, because shoot fate can be specified independently of type-B Arabidopsis Response Regulators when cytokinin is high.**\nSomatic embryogenesis is a different developmental path, typically induced under different hormonal regimes (often involving high auxin stress). The claim that shoot fate can be specified independently of Type-B ARRs directly contradicts the provided principle and extensive experimental evidence. The *arr1 arr12* mutant is known specifically for its severe defects in shoot regeneration from callus, demonstrating the essential role of these regulators.

Consider two genotypes: *ga1*, a loss-of-function mutation in a gibberellin biosynthetic enzyme leading to very low endogenous gibberellin levels, and *gai-1*, a dominant mutation in a DELLA protein that renders it non-degradable in response to gibberellin perception. Seedlings from both lines are germinated and grown under long-day conditions and sprayed daily with exogenous gibberellin ($GA_3$) at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for $7$ days, then maintained under the same treatment for an additional $7$ days ($14$ days total).

Both *ga1* and *gai-1* exhibit strong elongation and earlier flowering because exogenous gibberellin bypasses all upstream and downstream defects in the pathway.\n\nC. *ga1* remains dwarfed under exogenous gibberellin due to feedback suppression of gibberellin receptors, while *gai-1* elongates because stabilized DELLA proteins amplify gibberellin signaling.\n\nD. *ga1* shows only modest rescue of germination but no shoot elongation because elongation primarily requires cytokinin rather than gibberellin, whereas *gai-1* hyper-elongates due to elevated endogenous gibberellin caused by DELLA stabilization.\n\nE. Both *ga1* and *gai-1* fail to elongate under exogenous gibberellin because gibberellin broadly antagonizes auxin transport, leading to reduced growth even when the hormone is supplied externally.", "solution": "The reasoning must begin with core definitions and well-tested mechanisms of plant hormone action. Gibberellins (GA) promote cell elongation and developmental transitions such as stem elongation and flowering. The canonical mechanism in Arabidopsis involves GA binding to the GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor, which creates a complex with DELLA proteins (growth repressors). This binding enables recognition by the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (for example, $SCF^{SLY1/GID2}$), resulting in polyubiquitylation of DELLA proteins and their degradation by the $26\\mathrm{S}$ proteasome. Degradation of DELLA proteins derepresses GA-responsive gene expression and growth. Thus, the operational principle is that GA relieves DELLA-mediated repression; the biosynthesis of GA generates the ligand, and intact perception and proteolysis machinery transduce the signal.\n\nIn the *ga1* mutant, the lesion is in a gibberellin biosynthetic step (in Arabidopsis, *GA1* encodes ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase), so endogenous GA levels are very low. In the absence of ligand, DELLA proteins persist and repress growth, producing dwarfism, dark-green leaves, and delayed flowering. Because the signaling hardware (GID1 receptor, SCF complex, proteasome) remains intact, supplying exogenous GA (for example, $GA_3$ at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) restores ligand-receptor binding, leading to DELLA degradation and rescue of GA-dependent phenotypes, including stem elongation, leaf expansion, and promotion of flowering.\n\nIn contrast, *gai-1* is a dominant allele of a DELLA protein (*GAI*) with an N-terminal alteration that prevents GA-induced interaction with the GID1 receptor or subsequent recognition by the SCF complex. Functionally, *gai-1* DELLA is non-degradable in the presence of GA and therefore continues to repress GA-responsive growth. As a consequence, increasing extracellular GA cannot relieve repression because the defect lies downstream of ligand availability at the level of signal transduction and proteolysis. Thus, *gai-1* is GA-insensitive for elongation and related GA responses.\n\nApplying these principles to the experimental conditions (daily exogenous $GA_3$ at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for $14$ days), we predict that *ga1* plants will show robust rescue toward wild-type phenotypes: elongation of internodes, increased leaf expansion, and normalization or advancement of flowering time compared to untreated *ga1* controls. By contrast, *gai-1* plants will remain largely dwarfed with minimal changes in elongation or flowering, because the stabilized DELLA continues to repress growth irrespective of the applied GA.\n\nNow evaluate each option:\n\nA. This states that exogenous GA rescues *ga1* but not *gai-1*, with *gai-1* remaining dwarfed due to persistent DELLA repression. This aligns directly with the mechanism: *ga1* is a biosynthesis defect that is bypassed by supplying ligand; *gai-1* is a signaling defect at the DELLA degradation step that is not bypassed by ligand. Correct.\n\nB. This claims exogenous GA bypasses all defects, rescuing both mutants. This is incorrect because a non-degradable DELLA represents a downstream block that cannot be overcome by increased ligand; the core requirement for DELLA degradation is not met in *gai-1*. Incorrect.\n\nC. This proposes that exogenous GA suppresses receptors and that stabilized DELLA amplifies signaling, leading to *gai-1* elongation but not *ga1*. Both claims contradict established mechanisms. GID1 receptor levels are not acutely suppressed in a way that blocks *ga1* rescue, and stabilized DELLA represses rather than amplifies GA responses. Incorrect.\n\nD. This suggests elongation primarily requires cytokinin rather than GA and that *gai-1* hyper-elongates due to elevated endogenous GA caused by DELLA stabilization. Cytokinin and GA have distinct and sometimes opposing roles; GA is a principal driver of internode elongation, and DELLA stabilization does not elevate endogenous GA in a way that causes hyper-elongation. *gai-1* is classically GA-insensitive and dwarfed. Incorrect.\n\nE. This claims GA broadly antagonizes auxin transport to reduce growth even with external GA. While hormone crosstalk exists, GA application generally promotes elongation by removing DELLA-mediated repression and often synergizes with auxin for growth; there is no general rule that exogenous GA inhibits elongation via auxin antagonism across genotypes, nor would this explain the differential outcomes between *ga1* and *gai-1*. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the mechanistically supported outcome is that *ga1* is rescued by exogenous GA, whereas *gai-1* remains dwarfed and GA-insensitive under the same treatment.\n\nVerdict: Option A is correct; Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2661786"}]}
