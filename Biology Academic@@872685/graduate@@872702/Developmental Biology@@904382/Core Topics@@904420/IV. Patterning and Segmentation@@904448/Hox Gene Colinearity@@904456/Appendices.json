This practice provides an opportunity to move from qualitative description to quantitative analysis. Using a set of realistic, albeit hypothetical, expression boundary data for the *HoxA* cluster, you will apply a standard statistical method to measure the strength of the colinear relationship and appreciate how to formalize a key developmental concept [@problem_id:2644129].", "problem": "Hox genes in the A cluster (Hoxa1 through Hoxa13) exhibit spatial colinearity, whereby the genomic order of genes along the cluster correlates with the anterior-posterior (AP) positioning of their expression domains in the embryo. In an ideal case of perfect colinearity, the anterior expression boundary of each successive gene would shift strictly posteriorly along the AP axis as genomic index increases. Assume that in situ hybridization measurements in the mouse embryo yield the following anterior boundary coordinates along the AP axis, expressed as a dimensionless fraction $x$ of embryo length measured from the anterior tip ($x=0$) to the posterior tip ($x=1$):\nHoxa1: $x=0.12$, Hoxa2: $x=0.16$, Hoxa3: $x=0.23$, Hoxa4: $x=0.29$, Hoxa5: $x=0.34$, Hoxa6: $x=0.36$, Hoxa7: $x=0.35$, Hoxa8: $x=0.44$, Hoxa9: $x=0.52$, Hoxa10: $x=0.57$, Hoxa11: $x=0.56$, Hoxa12: $x=0.66$, Hoxa13: $x=0.74$.\nUsing only foundational definitions from the Central Dogma of molecular biology (Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) to Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to protein) and the concept that spatial colinearity is reflected by monotonic ordering of anterior boundaries with genomic index, formalize a rank-based, unitless monotonicity metric by treating genomic order ($i=1,\\dots,13$ for Hoxa1 to Hoxa13) and anterior boundary position ($x$) as two paired variables and taking the Pearson correlation of their rank transforms (that is, the Spearman rank correlation). Compute this monotonicity metric for the given data. There are no ties in the ranks. Express your final answer as an exact fraction. Do not include units.", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of developmental biology, specifically the phenomenon of Hox gene colinearity. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of data for the required calculation. The task is to formalize and compute a specific, well-defined statistical metric, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, to quantify the degree of colinearity.\n\nThe central concept is spatial colinearity, which posits a direct relationship between the linear sequence of Hox genes on a chromosome and their expression domains along the anterior-posterior axis of an embryo. In an ideal system, the anterior boundary of expression for the gene at genomic position $i$ would be strictly posterior to that of the gene at position $i-1$. This implies that a plot of the anterior boundary position, $x$, against the genomic index, $i$, should yield a monotonically increasing function. The given experimental data, however, may show deviations from this ideal.\n\nThe problem requires a formal, rank-based metric to quantify the degree of this monotonicity. The Central Dogma, from Deoxyribonucleic Acid ($DNA$) to Ribonucleic Acid ($RNA$) to protein, provides the fundamental mechanism by which gene sequence information is translated into functional products that establish these expression patterns, but the quantification of the pattern itself is a statistical question. The specified metric is the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, denoted by $\\rho$. This coefficient measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two ranked variables. For a dataset of $n$ paired observations $(i_k, x_k)$ where $k$ ranges from $1$ to $n$, the ranks of the $i$ values are denoted $R_{i,k}$ and the ranks of the $x$ values are denoted $R_{x,k}$. The Spearman correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient applied to these ranks.\n\nThe problem states there are no ties in the ranks. We verify this. The genomic indices $i$ are the integers from $1$ to $13$, which are naturally ordered with no ties. The anterior boundary coordinates $x_k$ are all distinct values, so their ranks will also have no ties. Given the absence of ties, a simplified formula for $\\rho$ is applicable:\n$$ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum_{k=1}^{n} d_k^2}{n(n^2 - 1)} $$\nHere, $n$ is the number of data pairs, and $d_k = R_{i,k} - R_{x,k}$ is the difference in ranks for the $k$-th pair.\n\nThe number of Hox genes is $n=13$.

Along the anteroposterior axis, boundaries are recorded as somite indices $S$ (counted from the most anterior somite, with $S=1$ at the first somite). The genes are ordered by their genomic position from $3'$ to $5'$ as Hoxb$1$, Hoxb$2$, Hoxb$3$, Hoxb$4$, Hoxb$5$, Hoxb$6$.

Hoxb$4$ violates colinearity because its anterior boundary at $S=8.0$ lies anterior to Hoxb$3$ at $S=9.0$. This can be explained by a gene-specific anterior Retinoic Acid–responsive enhancer that drives Hoxb$4$ transcription despite its $5'$ position, and, in the region of overlap, posterior prevalence allows Hoxb$4$ protein to repress Hoxb$3$, pushing Hoxb$3$’s anterior boundary posterior to that of Hoxb$4$.\n\nB.

It presents a standard dataset from developmental biology concerning *Hox* gene expression, a cornerstone of the field. The provided principles of spatial colinearity and posterior prevalence are fundamental concepts. The data values are biologically realistic for the specified developmental stage in the mouse. The question asks for a logical deduction based on the integration of empirical data and established theory, which is a standard scientific task. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies in the setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe principle of spatial colinearity dictates that the anterior expression boundary, denoted by somite index $S$, should be a non-decreasing function of the gene's position along the chromosome from $3'$ to $5'$. Let us denote the boundary for *Hoxb*`k` as $S_k$. The expected relationship is:\n$$S_1 \\le S_2 \\le S_3 \\le S_4 \\le S_5 \\le S_6$$\n\nLet us examine the provided mean values:\n-   $S_1 = 4.0$\n-   $S_2 = 6.0$\n-   $S_3 = 9.0$\n-   $S_4 = 8.0$\n-   $S_5 = 12.0$\n-   $S_6 = 15.0$\n\nComparing adjacent genes:\n-   $S_1 = 4.0  S_2 = 6.0$: Colinearity holds.\n-   $S_2 = 6.0  S_3 = 9.0$: Colinearity holds.\n-   $S_3 = 9.0  S_4 = 8.0$: **Colinearity is violated.** The gene *Hoxb4*, which is more $5'$ than *Hoxb3*, has an anterior boundary that is more anterior (smaller $S$) than *Hoxb3*.\n-   $S_4 = 8.0  S_5 = 12.0$: Colinearity holds.\n-   $S_5 = 12.0  S_6 = 15.0$: Colinearity holds.\n\nThe data clearly indicate a local inversion in the expression boundaries of *Hoxb3* and *Hoxb4*. We must determine if this observation is statistically robust or an artifact of measurement variability. The difference in means is $\\Delta S = S_3 - S_4 = 9.0 - 8.0 = 1.0$. The standard deviation for both measurements is $\\sigma = 0.5$ with a sample size of $n=4$. The standard error of the mean (SEM) for each is $SEM = \\sigma / \\sqrt{n} = 0.5 / \\sqrt{4} = 0.25$. The difference in means is $1.0 / 0.25 = 4$ times the SEM, suggesting the difference is not due to random chance. A formal two-sample t-test confirms this. The t-statistic is $t = (\\bar{x}_3 - \\bar{x}_4) / \\sqrt{s_3^2/n_3 + s_4^2/n_4} = (9.0 - 8.0) / \\sqrt{0.5^2/4 + 0.5^2/4} = 1.0 / \\sqrt{2 \\times 0.0625} = 1.0 / \\sqrt{0.125} \\approx 1.0 / 0.3535 \\approx 2.828$.

Hoxb$4$ violates colinearity because its anterior boundary at $S=8.0$ lies anterior to Hoxb$3$ at $S=9.0$. This can be explained by a gene-specific anterior Retinoic Acid–responsive enhancer that drives Hoxb$4$ transcription despite its $5'$ position, and, in the region of overlap, posterior prevalence allows Hoxb$4$ protein to repress Hoxb$3$, pushing Hoxb$3$’s anterior boundary posterior to that of Hoxb$4$.**\n-   **Violation Identification**: Correctly identifies that *Hoxb4* violates colinearity relative to *Hoxb3*.\n-   **Mechanistic Explanation**: This option proposes a two-part mechanism.\n    1.  *Hoxb4* is activated more anteriorly than expected due to a specific enhancer (e.g., one highly responsive to the anterior RA gradient). This is consistent with the foundational principle that enhancer regulation modulates transcriptional output. This would establish the *Hoxb4* boundary at $S=8$.\n    2.  The principle of posterior prevalence is then invoked. *Hoxb4* is a more $5'$ gene than *Hoxb3*. Therefore, where *Hoxb4* protein is present (from $S=8$ and posterior), it will repress the transcription of the more $3'$ *Hoxb3* gene. This repression would ensure that the anterior boundary of *Hoxb3* expression is established posterior to the *Hoxb4* boundary, at $S=9$. The two parts of the mechanism are synergistic and consistent with all provided foundational facts. This is, in fact, the accepted explanation for this well-known \"hiccup\" in *Hox* gene colinearity in the mouse.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B.

The difference in means is significant. The appeal to \"somitogenesis dynamics\" is a vague dismissal without quantitative basis.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Hoxb$2$ violates colinearity, and this is best explained by microRNA-mediated degradation of Hoxb$2$ messenger RNA in posterior tissues, causing its anterior boundary to shift posteriorly relative to Hoxb$1$.**\n-   **Violation Identification**: Incorrectly identifies *Hoxb2* as the violating gene. The data clearly show $S_1 = 4.0  S_2 = 6.0  S_3 = 9.0$. *Hoxb2* adheres to colinearity with respect to its neighbors.\n-   **Mechanistic Explanation**: As the premise is false, the explanation is irrelevant to the problem at hand.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Hoxb$4$ violates colinearity, and the correct explanation is anterior prevalence: more $3'$ Hox genes repress more $5'$ genes in anterior domains, forcing Hoxb$4$ anteriorly and leaving Hoxb$3$ posterior. This regulatory hierarchy accounts for the inversion at E$9.5$.**\n-   **Violation Identification**: Correctly identifies that *Hoxb4* violates colinearity.\n-   **Mechanistic Explanation**: This option invokes a principle of \"anterior prevalence\" (*3'* genes repress *5'* genes). This is in direct contradiction to the foundational principle of \"posterior prevalence\" explicitly given in the problem statement (*5'* genes repress *3'* genes). An explanation that violates a stated foundational principle of the system is invalid. While complex feedback loops exist in biology, posterior prevalence is the dominant paradigm for *Hox* cross-regulation along the anteroposterior axis.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the statistically significant violation of colinearity and provides a mechanistic explanation that is fully consistent with the provided foundational principles of developmental biology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2644090"}, {"introduction": "A true test of mechanistic understanding is the ability to predict the consequences of novel perturbations. This thought experiment asks you to act as a developmental geneticist, forecasting the impact of a specific genomic inversion on both spatial and temporal colinearity. By applying a sophisticated model of chromatin-based regulation, you will see how the physical position of genes relative to regulatory domains dictates their expression, a fundamental concept in modern genomics [@problem_id:2644099].", "problem": "In vertebrates, clustered Homeobox (Hox) genes exhibit spatial and temporal colinearity: genes nearer the $3'$ end of a cluster are activated earlier (temporal colinearity) and specify more anterior domains (spatial colinearity) than those nearer the $5'$ end. A widely accepted mechanistic base is that large regulatory landscapes on either side of the cluster, organized as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), engage the cluster in a position-dependent manner. The telomeric regulatory domain (T-DOM) on the $3'$ side harbors early enhancers, including Retinoic Acid (RA)-responsive elements, that first contact and open chromatin at the $3'$-proximal part of the cluster, with activation then progressing toward the $5'$ side. This process is coupled to chromatin state transitions (for example, decreased H3K27me3 and increased H3K27ac) and changes in promoter–enhancer contact frequency measurable by Chromosome Conformation Capture techniques. Assume the following engineered allele in the mouse HoxA cluster: an in-place inversion of the $3'$-proximal block spanning Hoxa1–Hoxa4, with precisely located breakpoints that do not move the block away from the $3'$ border, do not delete enhancers, and do not alter the TAD boundaries flanking the cluster. Thus, only the linear order of Hoxa1–Hoxa4 within the cluster is reversed relative to the $3'$ regulatory landscape; all other HoxA genes remain in their native order and position.\n\nBased on first principles above, predict how this inversion would alter spatial and temporal colinearity within the inverted block and state which experimental readouts would most sensitively detect the predicted anterior boundary shifts and activation timing changes. Choose the single best option.\n\nA. The inversion will reverse the relative temporal and spatial order among Hoxa1–Hoxa4 within the block because the gene now closest to the $3'$ border (Hoxa4 after inversion) will experience earlier contact with the $3'$ enhancers in the T-DOM. Consequently, Hoxa4 will activate earlier than Hoxa1 and its anterior expression boundary will shift anteriorly relative to wild type, whereas Hoxa1 will activate later and shift posteriorly; genes outside the block will retain their native colinearity. Appropriate readouts include stage-matched whole-mount in situ hybridization at defined somite counts (for example, $8$–$10$, $12$–$14$, $16$–$18$) to map anterior boundaries, time-resolved nascent transcription assays (for example, Global Run-On sequencing or metabolic labeling) to quantify activation timing, and promoter-anchored Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture (for example, 4C-seq) from each Hoxa promoter to measure increased contact frequency with $3'$ enhancers for the gene nearest $3'$; dynamic Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K27ac/H3K27me3 at these promoters would corroborate timing.\n\nB. The inversion will abolish colinearity cluster-wide, driving uniform anteriorization and earlier activation of all HoxA genes, because the polarity of transcription is disrupted. Appropriate readouts are a single bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) time point from whole embryos and immunostaining for HOXA proteins without somite-stage matching, since the effect is global.\n\nC. The inversion will have no effect on spatial or temporal colinearity because colinearity depends on transcriptional orientation rather than linear genomic position within the cluster. Appropriate readouts focus on strand-specific RNA-seq to verify transcriptional direction and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to assess accessibility, without the need to map expression boundaries.\n\nD. The inversion will delay activation of all four genes and shift all their anterior boundaries posteriorly because the inversion insulates the block from the $3'$ regulatory domain by creating a new TAD boundary. Appropriate readouts include low-resolution Hi-C (for example, 1 megabase bins) to verify the boundary and Western blot for HOXA proteins to quantify reduced abundance.\n\nE. The inversion will primarily cause ectopic activation of posterior Hox genes (for example, Hoxa9–Hoxa13) due to enhancer hijacking from the $3'$ side, with minimal effect on Hoxa1–Hoxa4.

All other HoxA genes ($Hoxa5$ and posterior) remain in their native order and position.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to validation against established criteria.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes the canonical model of Hox gene regulation, which is a cornerstone of developmental biology. This model, involving progressive activation from a $3'$ regulatory center, chromatin state dynamics, and TADs, is strongly supported by decades of experimental evidence. The concepts of RA signaling, histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K27ac), and Chromosome Conformation Capture techniques are all standard and factual within the field.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem defines a precise genetic perturbation (an inversion of a specific gene block) and provides a clear mechanistic framework within which to predict the outcome. The constraints on the inversion (no change in TAD boundaries, no deletion of enhancers) serve to isolate the variable of interest—the linear order of genes—making the problem well-posed for a unique, logical deduction.\n- **Objectivity**: The description is entirely technical and objective, based on established biological terminology and models, free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria: it is scientifically sound, formalizable, self-contained, and poses a non-trivial question whose predictions are experimentally verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe central principle given is that the activation of the Hox cluster is initiated by enhancers in the $3'$ T-DOM, and this activation proceeds sequentially through the cluster, with the gene physically closest to the $3'$ end being activated first. This establishes a direct causal link between linear genomic position relative to the $3'$ regulatory domain and the timing of gene activation.\n\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT) State**: In the normal HoxA cluster, the gene order from $3'$ to $5'$ is Hoxa1, Hoxa2, Hoxa3, Hoxa4, etc. According to the model, Hoxa1 is physically closest to the $3'$ T-DOM. Therefore, it is the first to be contacted by the early enhancers, to have its chromatin opened, and to be transcribed. This early activation corresponds to its function in specifying the most anterior domain among this group. Activation then progresses to Hoxa2, Hoxa3, and Hoxa4 in sequence.\n\n2.  **Engineered (Inverted) State**: The problem states an in-place inversion of the Hoxa1–Hoxa4 block. The original sequence within the block was $3'$-Hoxa1-Hoxa2-Hoxa3-Hoxa4-$5'$. The inverted sequence is $3'$-Hoxa4-Hoxa3-Hoxa2-Hoxa1-$5'$. Importantly, the entire block remains at the $3'$ border of the cluster.\n\n3.  **Prediction**: Applying the principle of proximity-driven activation, the gene now physically closest to the $3'$ T-DOM is Hoxa4. Therefore, Hoxa4 is predicted to be the first gene in the cluster to be activated. Following Hoxa4, the activation front will encounter Hoxa3, then Hoxa2, and finally Hoxa1. Consequently, the temporal order of activation for this block will be reversed from $1-2-3-4$ to $4-3-2-1$. According to the principle of spatial colinearity, where earlier activation dictates a more anterior expression boundary, this reversal in timing will lead to a corresponding reversal in spatial expression domains. Hoxa4 will now have the most anterior boundary (a significant anterior shift relative to WT), while Hoxa1 will have the most posterior boundary within this block (a posterior shift relative to WT). The genes outside the inverted block, such as Hoxa5, remain in their original position relative to the block as a whole and should maintain their colinear relationship with respect to the now-reordered Hoxa1-Hoxa4 unit.\n\n4.  **Experimental Verification**: To rigorously test this prediction, one must employ methods that can precisely measure:\n    - **Spatial Expression Boundaries**: This requires visualizing mRNA transcripts within the spatial context of the embryo. Stage-matched embryos are essential for comparison. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) for each of the four genes in embryos at precisely defined somite stages is the definitive assay for mapping anterior boundaries.\n    - **Temporal Activation Timing**: This requires measuring the onset of transcription, not just steady-state mRNA levels. Assays for nascent transcripts, such as Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) or metabolic labeling of RNA, provide the necessary temporal resolution.\n    - **Mechanistic Changes**: The model posits changes in promoter-enhancer contacts and chromatin state. These can be measured directly. Promoter-anchored Chromosome Conformation Capture (e.g., 4C-seq) using the promoters of Hoxa1 and Hoxa4 as viewpoints would test the prediction that Hoxa4 now shows increased contact frequency with the $3'$ T-DOM at early stages. Time-resolved Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for active (H3K27ac) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks at the promoters would confirm the predicted timing of chromatin state transition.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The inversion will reverse the relative temporal and spatial order among Hoxa1–Hoxa4 within the block because the gene now closest to the $3'$ border (Hoxa4 after inversion) will experience earlier contact with the $3'$ enhancers in the T-DOM. Consequently, Hoxa4 will activate earlier than Hoxa1 and its anterior expression boundary will shift anteriorly relative to wild type, whereas Hoxa1 will activate later and shift posteriorly; genes outside the block will retain their native colinearity. Appropriate readouts include stage-matched whole-mount in situ hybridization at defined somite counts (for example, $8$–$10$, $12$–$14$, $16$–$18$) to map anterior boundaries, time-resolved nascent transcription assays (for example, Global Run-On sequencing or metabolic labeling) to quantify activation timing, and promoter-anchored Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture (for example, 4C-seq) from each Hoxa promoter to measure increased contact frequency with $3'$ enhancers for the gene nearest $3'$; dynamic Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K27ac/H3K27me3 at these promoters would corroborate timing.**\nThis option presents a biological prediction that is a direct logical consequence of the mechanistic model provided in the problem statement. The description of Hoxa4 activation becoming earlier and more anterior, and Hoxa1 activation becoming later and more posterior, is precisely correct. The proposed experimental readouts are not only appropriate but represent the state-of-the-art, high-resolution methods required to rigorously test every aspect of the prediction: spatial mapping (stage-matched WISH), temporal dynamics (nascent transcriptomics), and underlying mechanism (4C-seq, dynamic ChIP-seq). The entire statement is coherent and scientifically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The inversion will abolish colinearity cluster-wide, driving uniform anteriorization and earlier activation of all HoxA genes, because the polarity of transcription is disrupted. Appropriate readouts are a single bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) time point from whole embryos and immunostaining for HOXA proteins without somite-stage matching, since the effect is global.**\nThis prediction is incorrect. The model does not depend on the \"polarity of transcription\" of the entire block, but on the linear proximity of individual gene promoters to the $3'$ regulatory domain. An effect localized to the inverted block is expected, not a global abolition of colinearity. The proposed experimental methods are grossly inadequate; a single, non-staged time point cannot resolve temporal or spatial changes, and bulk RNA-seq is a poor measure of activation onset.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The inversion will have no effect on spatial or temporal colinearity because colinearity depends on transcriptional orientation rather than linear genomic position within the cluster. Appropriate readouts focus on strand-specific RNA-seq to verify transcriptional direction and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to assess accessibility, without the need to map expression boundaries.**\nThis option's premise—that colinearity depends on transcriptional orientation and not linear position—directly contradicts the mechanistic basis provided in the problem statement (\"genes nearer the $3'$ end... are activated earlier\"). Therefore, the prediction of \"no effect\" is invalid within the context of the problem. Furthermore, suggesting there is \"no need to map expression boundaries\" is a fatal flaw when the core topic is spatial colinearity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The inversion will delay activation of all four genes and shift all their anterior boundaries posteriorly because the inversion insulates the block from the $3'$ regulatory domain by creating a new TAD boundary. Appropriate readouts include low-resolution Hi-C (for example, 1 megabase bins) to verify the boundary and Western blot for HOXA proteins to quantify reduced abundance.**\nThis prediction is based on an assumption that is explicitly excluded by the problem statement: \"do not alter the TAD boundaries flanking the cluster.\" An inversion within a domain does not necessarily create a new boundary. The prediction is therefore unfounded. The proposed readouts are also\npoorly suited: 1 megabase resolution Hi-C is far too coarse to analyze a gene cluster of approximately $100$ kilobases, and Western blot lacks the spatial and temporal resolution required.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The inversion will primarily cause ectopic activation of posterior Hox genes (for example, Hoxa9–Hoxa13) due to enhancer hijacking from the $3'$ side, with minimal effect on Hoxa1–Hoxa4. Appropriate readouts are static ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 at posterior genes and no need for temporal or boundary analyses within the inverted block.**\nThis prediction is less plausible than A. While complex regulatory re-wirings can occur, the primary effect of moving genes relative to a proximal regulatory element, as per the given model, would be on those moved genes themselves. To suggest \"minimal effect\" on the very genes that were rearranged is illogical. The proposal to ignore the inverted block experimentally is a non-scientific approach to the question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2644099"}]}
