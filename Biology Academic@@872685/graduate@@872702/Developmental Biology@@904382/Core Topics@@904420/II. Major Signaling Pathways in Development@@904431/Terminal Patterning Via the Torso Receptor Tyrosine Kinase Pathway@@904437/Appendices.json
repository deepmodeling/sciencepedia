This is a classic reaction-diffusion problem.\n\nLet $C(x, t)$ be the concentration of dpERK at position $x$ and time $t$. The dynamics of this system are described by the reaction-diffusion equation. The change in concentration over time, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$, is the sum of contributions from diffusion and reaction.\n\nThe principle of mass conservation in one dimension is stated by the continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $J(x, t)$ is the flux of the substance.

As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp\\left(x\\sqrt{k/D}\\right)$ grows without bound. To ensure a finite concentration, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, we set $c_1 = 0$.

This is described by the property that the intensity decreases by a constant factor over distance increments of size $\\lambda$.\n- The transcription factor *tailless* (*tll*) is activated when the local dpERK intensity reaches a threshold.\n- The activation threshold is a fixed fraction, $f$, of the anterior peak intensity.\n- Numerical values provided are: $\\lambda = 35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $f = 0.4$.\n- The task is to derive an expression for the activation position $x^{\\ast}$ in terms of $\\lambda$ and $f$, evaluate it numerically, and analyze the sensitivity of $x^{\\ast}$ to variations in $\\lambda$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in developmental biology. The description of terminal patterning in *Drosophila* via the Torso pathway, the resulting graded distribution of dpERK, and the threshold-based activation of a target gene like *tailless* are established and fundamental concepts in the field. The use of an exponential decay model is a standard, empirically supported approximation for such morphogen gradients.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

The description of exponential decay, while phrased in terms of a property (\"decreases by a constant factor over distance increments of size $\\lambda$\"), is a defining characteristic of the standard exponential function $I(x) = I_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda')$. For a distance increment of $\\lambda$, the intensity becomes $I(x+\\lambda) = I(x) \\exp(-\\lambda/\\lambda')$, a constant factor. The most direct interpretation, consistent with standard practice, is that the parameter $\\lambda$ in the problem is the characteristic length in the exponent, i.e., $I(x) = I_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nLet $x$ represent the distance from the anterior pole of the embryo, so that $x=0$ corresponds to the pole itself. Let $I(x)$ be the concentration or intensity of dpERK at position $x$. The peak intensity occurs at the anterior pole, which we denote as $I_0 = I(0)$.\n\nThe problem states that the dpERK intensity profile follows an exponential decay with a characteristic length scale $\\lambda$. This is mathematically expressed as:\n$$I(x) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThis functional form exhibits the property described in the problem: for any fixed distance increment $\\Delta x$, the ratio $I(x+\\Delta x)/I(x) = \\exp(-\\Delta x/\\lambda)$ is a constant, independent of $x$.\n\nThe transcription factor *tailless* (*tll*) is activated at a specific position, which we will call $x^{\\ast}$, where the local dpERK intensity $I(x^{\\ast})$ is equal to a fraction $f$ of the peak intensity $I_0$. This defines the activation threshold condition:\n$$I(x^{\\ast}) = f \\cdot I_0$$\nBy substituting the expression for $I(x)$, we obtain an equation for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = f \\cdot I_0$$\nThe peak intensity $I_0$ is a non-zero quantity, so it can be cancelled from both sides of the equation. This is a crucial step, as it shows the position of the boundary is independent of the absolute magnitude of the signal, a property known as scaling.\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = f$$\nTo solve for $x^{\\ast}$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) = \\ln(f)$$\nUsing the property that $\\ln(\\exp(y)) = y$, we have:\n$$-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(f)$$\nFinally, we solve for $x^{\\ast}$ by multiplying both sides by $-\\lambda$:\n$$x^{\\ast} = -\\lambda \\ln(f)$$\nSince $f$ is a fraction such that $0 < f < 1$, its natural logarithm $\\ln(f)$ is negative. Therefore, the product $-\\lambda \\ln(f)$ is a positive quantity, which is physically required for a distance. The expression can also be written as $x^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln(1/f)$, which makes the positivity explicit. This is the general expression for the activation position.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the values $\\lambda = 35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $f = 0.4$. We substitute these into our derived expression:\n$$x^{\\ast} = -(35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\ln(0.4)$$\nThe value of $\\ln(0.4)$ is approximately $-0.91629$.\n$$x^{\\ast} \\approx -(35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\times (-0.91629) \\approx 32.07015\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$x^{\\ast} \\approx 32.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**Qualitative Sensitivity Analysis**\nThe derived expression is $x^{\\ast} = -\\lambda \\ln(f)$. We are asked to analyze the sensitivity of $x^{\\ast}$ to variation in $\\lambda$ and how this sensitivity depends on $f$.\n\nFirst, we examine the relationship between $x^{\\ast}$ and $\\lambda$. The expression shows that $x^{\\ast}$ is directly proportional to $\\lambda$. The constant of proportionality is $-\\ln(f)$. This means that a percentage change in $\\lambda$ will result in the same percentage change in $x^{\\ast}$. For example, if $\\lambda$ increases by $10\\%$, $x^{\\ast}$ will also increase by $10\\%$. Therefore, the position of the activation boundary $x^{\\ast}$ is indeed sensitive to variations in the gradient length scale $\\lambda$.\n\nSecond, we analyze how this sensitivity depends on the threshold value $f$. The sensitivity of $x^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\lambda$ can be formally defined by the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial x^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\lambda}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\left[ -\\lambda \\ln(f) \\right] = -\\ln(f)$$\nThis sensitivity, $-\\ln(f)$, is not a constant; it is a function of the threshold fraction $f$.\nLet us examine the behavior of this sensitivity term for different values of $f$ within its allowed range $0 < f < 1$.\n\n- When $f$ is close to $1$ (e.g., $f=0.9$), the activation threshold is very high, and the boundary forms close to the source at $x=0$. In this case, $\\ln(f)$ is a small negative number, so the sensitivity $-\\ln(f)$ is a small positive number. As $f \\to 1^{-}$, $\\ln(f) \\to 0$, and the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial x^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\lambda} \\to 0$. This means that for high activation thresholds, the boundary position is very robust and insensitive to fluctuations in the length scale $\\lambda$.\n\n- When $f$ is small (e.g., $f=0.1$), the activation threshold is low, and the boundary forms far from the source. In this case, $\\ln(f)$ is a large negative number, so the sensitivity $-\\ln(f)$ is a large positive number. As $f \\to 0^{+}$, $\\ln(f) \\to -\\infty$, and the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial x^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\lambda} \\to +\\infty$. This means that for low activation thresholds, the boundary position is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the length scale $\\lambda$.\n\nIn summary, the position $x^{\\ast}$ is linearly sensitive to changes in $\\lambda$. This sensitivity is not uniform but is modulated by the threshold fraction $f$. The system is robust to changes in $\\lambda$ for high thresholds (large $f$) and highly sensitive to changes in $\\lambda$ for low thresholds (small $f$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{32.1}$$", "id": "2676692"}]}
