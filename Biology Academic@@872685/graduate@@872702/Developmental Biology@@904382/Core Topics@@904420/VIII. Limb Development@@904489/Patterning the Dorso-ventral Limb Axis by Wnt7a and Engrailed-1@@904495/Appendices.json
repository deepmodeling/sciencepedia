Mastering this logic is essential for dissecting any signaling cascade.", "problem": "In vertebrate limb development, signals from the ectoderm instruct mesenchymal cell fates along the dorsal-ventral axis. A canonical and well-tested set of observations forms the foundational base: a secreted ligand from dorsal ectoderm, Wingless/Integrated family member Wnt7a (*Wnt7a*), induces a dorsal mesenchymal transcriptional program; the LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta (LMX1B, encoded by *Lmx1b*) is required cell-autonomously in dorsal mesenchyme for dorsal identity; and the ventral ectoderm transcription factor Engrailed-1 (*En1*) restricts dorsal signals to dorsal territory by repressing their ectopic ventral expression. By the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, secreted ligands activate intracellular signaling that modifies transcriptional programs, and by the core definition of genetic epistasis in a linear pathway, if gene *X* activates gene *Y* to produce process *P*, then in loss-of-function double mutants *X*;*Y* the phenotype for process *P* is dominated by the loss of the downstream gene *Y*, and constitutive activation of *Y* can bypass the loss of *X*, whereas activation of *X* cannot bypass the loss of *Y*.\n\nYou are given null alleles of *Wnt7a* and *Lmx1b*, and tools to drive ectopic gene expression in tissue-restricted domains (for example, mesenchymal *Prx1*-driven *Lmx1b* and ectodermal *keratin-14*-driven *Wnt7a*). You seek to design and interpret an epistasis test to place *Lmx1b* downstream of *Wnt7a* specifically in the dorsalization pathway. For the purpose of this question, focus only on dorsal-ventral identity of limb surfaces and dorsal mesenchyme, and ignore anterior-posterior effects or other roles of Wnt signaling.\n\nWhich option best specifies both a valid experimental design and the dominant phenotype prediction that would support the conclusion that *Lmx1b* acts downstream of *Wnt7a* in a linear dorsalization pathway?\n\nA.

The *Wnt7a*;*Lmx1b* double-null shows a dorsalized limb because ventral repression is released in the absence of *En1* activity.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the canonical principles of developmental biology, specifically vertebrate limb axis patterning. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear definition of genetic epistasis and sufficient information to design and interpret the required thought experiment. The terminology is precise and objective, and the experimental tools described (*Wnt7a* and *Lmx1b* null alleles, tissue-specific misexpression systems) are standard in the field. Therefore, a rigorous derivation of the solution is possible.\n\nThe objective is to devise an epistasis test to validate the hypothesis that the secreted ligand *Wnt7a* acts upstream of the transcription factor *Lmx1b* in a linear pathway to specify dorsal cell fate in the limb mesenchyme. The proposed pathway is:\n\n$$Wnt7a \\rightarrow \\text{Signal Transduction} \\rightarrow Lmx1b \\rightarrow \\text{Dorsal Identity}$$\n\nTo test this model, we must apply the principles of genetic epistasis as explicitly defined in the problem statement. Let *X* represent the upstream gene (*Wnt7a*) and *Y* represent the downstream gene (*Lmx1b*). The process *P* is dorsalization.\n\n1.  **Loss-of-Function Double Mutant Analysis:** The rule states that the phenotype of the *X*;*Y* double mutant is dominated by the loss of the downstream gene, *Y*.\n    *   The loss-of-function phenotype for *Wnt7a* is a failure of dorsalization, resulting in a limb with two ventral sides.\n    *   The loss-of-function phenotype for *Lmx1b* is also a failure of dorsalization, resulting in a limb with two ventral sides, as LMX1B is required cell-autonomously for dorsal identity.\n    *   Therefore, in a *Wnt7a*;*Lmx1b* double-null mutant, the phenotype must match that of the *Lmx1b* single-null mutant. Both single mutants and the double mutant will exhibit a ventralized limb phenotype, characterized by the absence of dorsal mesenchymal markers.\n\n2.  **Epistatic Rescue or \"Bypass\" Experiments:**\n    *   **Test 1 (Rescue of Upstream Mutant):** The rule states that constitutive activation of *Y* can bypass the loss of *X*. In our model, this means that providing *Lmx1b* function should rescue the dorsalization defect in a *Wnt7a*-null background. Experimentally, this involves forcing the expression of *Lmx1b* in the dorsal mesenchyme (e.g., using a *Prx1* driver) of a *Wnt7a* mutant. The predicted outcome is the restoration of dorsal identity, as the requirement for the upstream signal (*Wnt7a*) is circumvented by directly activating the downstream effector (*Lmx1b*).\n    *   **Test 2 (Rescue of Downstream Mutant):** The rule states that activation of *X* cannot bypass the loss of *Y*. This means that providing more *Wnt7a* signal cannot rescue the dorsalization defect in an *Lmx1b*-null background. Experimentally, one would ectopically express *Wnt7a* in the ectoderm (e.g., using a *keratin-14* driver) of an *Lmx1b* mutant. The predicted outcome is a failure to rescue dorsal identity. The *Wnt7a* signal is present, but the pathway is broken because the essential downstream component, *Lmx1b*, is absent.\n\nBased on this derivation, a successful epistasis test supporting the *Wnt7a* $\\rightarrow$ *Lmx1b* model must satisfy all three of these predictions. We will now evaluate each option against this logical framework.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n**A. In *Wnt7a*;*Lmx1b* double-null limbs, dorsal mesenchymal markers are absent and both limb surfaces adopt ventral identity, matching the *Lmx1b* single-null with respect to dorsal-ventral patterning. Forced mesenchymal *Lmx1b* expression rescues dorsal markers and dorsal morphology in a *Wnt7a*-null background, whereas ectodermal *Wnt7a* expression fails to rescue dorsal mesenchymal identity in an *Lmx1b*-null background.**\nThis option presents a set of results that perfectly aligns with our derived predictions.\n*   The double-mutant phenotype is correctly described as matching the downstream *Lmx1b*-null phenotype (Prediction 1).\n*   Forced *Lmx1b* expression correctly rescues the *Wnt7a*-null phenotype (Prediction 2, Test 1).\n*   Ectodermal *Wnt7a* expression correctly fails to rescue the *Lmx1b*-null phenotype (Prediction 2, Test 2).\nTherefore, this option describes the precise experimental design and outcomes that would rigorously support the conclusion that *Lmx1b* acts downstream of *Wnt7a*.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In *Wnt7a*;*Lmx1b* double-null limbs, dorsal mesenchymal markers are absent and both limb surfaces adopt ventral identity, matching the *Wnt7a* single-null with respect to dorsal-ventral patterning. Ectodermal *Wnt7a* expression rescues dorsal mesenchymal identity in an *Lmx1b*-null background, whereas mesenchymal *Lmx1b* expression fails to rescue dorsalization in a *Wnt7a*-null background.**\nThis option is flawed. While the double-mutant phenotype is correctly described in its appearance, stating it matches the *Wnt7a* single-null is less precise than matching the downstream *Lmx1b*-null, although in this case they are identical. The critical flaw lies in the rescue experiments. It states that *Wnt7a* expression rescues the *Lmx1b*-null, and that *Lmx1b* expression fails to rescue the *Wnt7a*-null. This is the reverse of the correct epistatic logic for the proposed pathway and would instead support a model where *Wnt7a* is downstream of *Lmx1b*.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In *Wnt7a*;*Lmx1b* double-null limbs, dorsal mesenchymal identity is partially retained, consistent with parallel and redundant pathways. Both ectodermal *Wnt7a* and mesenchymal *Lmx1b* misexpression rescue dorsalization in either single-null background.**\nThis option describes results that would refute, not support, a simple linear pathway model. Partial retention of phenotype in a double mutant is a hallmark of genetic redundancy or parallel pathways. Furthermore, the ability of *Wnt7a* to rescue an *Lmx1b*-null would violate the fundamental rule of epistasis in a linear pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Overexpressing *En1* in dorsal ectoderm rescues dorsalization in *Lmx1b*-null and *Wnt7a*;*Lmx1b* double-null limbs by restoring polarity. The *Wnt7a*;*Lmx1b* double-null shows a dorsalized limb because ventral repression is released in the absence of *En1* activity.**\nThis option is based on faulty biological reasoning. The problem statement establishes *En1* as a ventral repressor of dorsal signals. Overexpressing *En1* dorsally would be expected to antagonize, not rescue, dorsalization. The second sentence presents a non-sequitur, incorrectly linking the *Wnt7a*;*Lmx1b* double-mutant to a hypothetical loss of *En1* activity and wrongly predicting a dorsalized phenotype, whereas the loss of *Wnt7a* and *Lmx1b* causes ventralization.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, only option A correctly specifies the experimental design and the set of outcomes required to demonstrate, by the principles of genetic epistasis, that *Lmx1b* functions downstream of *Wnt7a* in the dorsalization of the vertebrate limb.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2661091"}, {"introduction": "Once a signaling pathway is identified, the next step is often to understand how its activity is spatially restricted to generate a pattern.

Use the following well-established facts as the starting point for your reasoning. First, the dorsal ectoderm expresses Wnt family member 7A (*Wnt7a*), which signals to the dorsal mesenchyme to induce LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta (*Lmx1b*), a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for dorsal mesenchymal identity. Second, the ventral ectoderm expresses Engrailed-1 (*En1*), a transcriptional repressor that prevents *Wnt7a* expression in the ventral ectoderm, thereby restricting dorsalizing signal to the dorsal side. Third, when *En1* function is lost, *Wnt7a* is derepressed in ventral ectoderm, producing ectopic dorsalizing signal and dorsalization of ventral mesenchyme. Fourth, when *Wnt7a* function is lost, dorsal fate is not induced in the mesenchyme, and dorsal structures fail to form.\n\nConsider a double mutant embryo that is null for both *En1* and *Wnt7a*. In this genetic context, *En1* loss would normally derepress *Wnt7a* ventrally, but *Wnt7a* is genetically absent. Based on the above principles—signal restriction by repression, requirement of a dorsalizing ligand for induction of a downstream transcription factor, and genetic epistasis in linear pathways—predict the most likely dorsal–ventral patterning outcome in the limb and interpret what this reveals about the necessity and epistasis relationship of *Wnt7a* in specifying dorsal fate.\n\nWhich option best matches the expected phenotype and the correct interpretation?\n\nA.

Dorsal ectoderm expresses Wnt family member 7A (*Wnt7a*).\n2.  *Wnt7a* signals to dorsal mesenchyme to induce LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta (*Lmx1b*).\n3.  *Lmx1b* is a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for dorsal mesenchymal identity.\n4.

Loss of *Wnt7a* function leads to failure of dorsal fate induction, and dorsal structures do not form.\n8.  The problem considers a double mutant embryo that is null for both *En1* and *Wnt7a*.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement describes a well-characterized genetic regulatory network in vertebrate limb development.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The roles of *Wnt7a*, *En1*, and *Lmx1b* in dorsal-ventral axis patterning of the limb are foundational concepts in developmental biology, supported by extensive experimental evidence. The described single-mutant phenotypes are factually correct. The problem is firmly based on established scientific principles.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem asks to predict the phenotype of a double mutant based on the logic of a given genetic pathway. This is a standard problem in genetics, specifically in epistasis analysis. A unique, logical solution can be derived from the premises.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Self-Contained and Consistent:** The provided facts are sufficient to construct the genetic pathway and deduce the outcome. There are no internal contradictions. Fact 5 establishes *En1* as a repressor of *Wnt7a*. Fact 2 establishes *Wnt7a* as an inducer of *Lmx1b*. This forms a simple, linear regulatory cascade: *En1* $\\dashv$ *Wnt7a* $\\rightarrow$ *Lmx1b*. The logic is sound.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard exercise in genetic logic and epistasis. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem describes a genetic pathway governing dorsal fate specification in the developing limb. This pathway can be represented as a linear sequence of events:\n1.  In the ventral ectoderm, the transcription factor *En1* is normally expressed.\n2.  *En1* functions to repress the expression of the *Wnt7a* gene. This is denoted as *En1* $\\dashv$ *Wnt7a*.\n3.  In the dorsal ectoderm, *En1* is absent, so *Wnt7a* is expressed.\n4.  The secreted Wnt7a protein acts as a signal (a ligand) that binds to receptors on the underlying dorsal mesenchyme.\n5.  This signaling event induces the expression of the transcription factor *Lmx1b* in the dorsal mesenchyme.\n6.  *Lmx1b* then directs the cells to adopt a dorsal fate.\nThe complete pathway for dorsal specification is thus: *En1* $\\dashv$ *Wnt7a* $\\rightarrow$ *Lmx1b* $\\rightarrow$ Dorsal Fate.\n\nWe are asked to predict the phenotype of a double mutant, where both *En1* and *Wnt7a* are non-functional (null mutants). Let us analyze this situation using the principles of epistasis. Epistasis refers to a phenomenon where the phenotypic effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. In a linear pathway, a mutation in a downstream gene is typically epistatic to a mutation in an upstream gene.\n\nLet's consider the state of the pathway in the double mutant:\n-   **Effect of *En1* loss:** The gene for *En1* is non-functional. Therefore, the repressor En1 is not produced. In a normal context, this would lead to the derepression of the *Wnt7a* gene in the ventral ectoderm. The genetic \"stop\" signal is removed.\n-   **Effect of *Wnt7a* loss:** The gene for *Wnt7a* is also non-functional. This means that even if the repressor (*En1*) is absent and the *Wnt7a* gene is \"turned on\" transcriptionally, no functional Wnt7a protein can be produced.\n-   **Combined effect:** The absence of the *En1* repressor is rendered irrelevant by the absence of a functional *Wnt7a* gene to be expressed. There will be no Wnt7a protein secreted from either the dorsal or the ventral ectoderm.\n-   **Downstream consequence:** Since *Wnt7a* is the required signaling ligand to induce *Lmx1b* (as stated in given fact 7), and no Wnt7a is present, *Lmx1b* will not be induced in the mesenchyme.\n-   **Final phenotype:** Without *Lmx1b* expression, dorsal fate cannot be specified. The entire limb mesenchyme, both dorsal and ventral, will fail to acquire dorsal identity. This results in a limb that is \"ventralized,\" meaning it has ventral characteristics on all sides. This phenotype is identical to that of the *Wnt7a* single mutant, as described in given fact 4.\n\n**Epistasis analysis:** Since the phenotype of the double mutant (*En1*-null; *Wnt7a*-null) is identical to the phenotype of the *Wnt7a*-null single mutant, we conclude that the *Wnt7a* gene is epistatic to the *En1* gene. This is expected, as *Wnt7a* acts downstream of *En1* in the control of dorsal fate. The necessity of *Wnt7a* is demonstrated by the fact that in its absence, the state of its upstream regulator (*En1*) does not matter; dorsal fate is not specified regardless.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Circumferential dorsalization of the limb ectoderm and mesenchyme (“double dorsal”), with dorsal structures surrounding the limb, indicating that *En1* is necessary and epistatic to *Wnt7a* for dorsal fate.**\nThe predicted phenotype, \"double dorsal,\" is the phenotype of an *En1* single mutant, not the double mutant. The reasoning fails to account for the absence of *Wnt7a*. The interpretation of epistasis is incorrect; *Wnt7a* is epistatic to *En1*, not the other way around.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Loss of dorsal fate with ventral structures encircling the limb (“ventralized” limb resembling a *Wnt7a* single mutant), indicating that *Wnt7a* is necessary and epistatic to *En1* for dorsal fate.**\nThe predicted phenotype, a \"ventralized\" limb, matches our derivation. This phenotype is indeed that of a *Wnt7a* single mutant. The interpretation that *Wnt7a* is necessary for dorsal fate and epistatic to *En1* is correct, as the loss of the downstream component (*Wnt7a*) determines the final outcome, masking the effect of the loss of the upstream regulator (*En1*).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Near-normal dorsal–ventral patterning due to compensation by Wnt family member 7B (*Wnt7b*) and autoactivation of LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta (*Lmx1b*), indicating that *Wnt7a* is sufficient but not necessary for dorsal fate.**\nThis option introduces mechanisms (*Wnt7b* compensation, *Lmx1b* autoactivation) that are not included in the problem statement's given facts. Reasoning must be confined to the provided information. Furthermore, the conclusion that *Wnt7a* is not necessary directly contradicts given fact 7, which states that its loss prevents the formation of dorsal structures.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A mixed pattern with dorsal identity restricted to the anterior side and ventral identity to the posterior side due to crosstalk with Sonic hedgehog (*Shh*), indicating that neither gene is epistatic and that dorsal–ventral patterning is primarily determined by anterior–posterior cues.**\nThis option incorrectly mixes the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis with the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. It introduces the A-P signaling molecule *Shh*, which is outside the scope of the problem as defined. The conclusion that neither gene is epistatic is a direct contradiction of the result from a standard epistasis test on this linear pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2661122"}, {"introduction": "Qualitative genetic pathways provide a blueprint, but mathematical modeling allows us to understand the dynamics of how patterns form.

This pre-pattern biases the system, favoring $W$ production dorsally and $E$ production ventrally. The parameters $\\alpha_W$ and $\\alpha_E$ control the strength of this bias. A balanced bias ($\\alpha_W \\approx \\alpha_E$) is expected to pin the boundary between the two domains, while an imbalanced bias will cause the boundary to drift, creating a traveling front.\n\nTo solve this system computationally, we employ the method of lines, which involves discretizing the spatial domain first.\n\n**Spatial Discretization:**\nThe domain $x \\in [0, L]$ is discretized into $N_x$ equidistant points $x_i = i \\cdot \\Delta x$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N_x-1$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L / (N_x-1)$. The second spatial derivative (the Laplacian) is approximated using a second-order central difference formula:\n$$\n\\partial_{xx} C(x_i) \\approx \\frac{C(x_{i+1}) - 2C(x_i) + C(x_{i-1})}{(\\Delta x)^2} = \\frac{C_{i+1} - 2C_i + C_{i-1}}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nThe no-flux boundary conditions, $\\partial_x C = 0$ at $x=0$ and $x=L$, are enforced by introducing \"ghost points\" such that $C_{-1} = C_1$ and $C_{N_x} = C_{N_x-2}$. This leads to modified formulas for the Laplacian at the boundaries:\n$$\n\\text{at } i=0: \\quad \\partial_{xx} C_0 \\approx \\frac{2(C_1 - C_0)}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{at } i=N_x-1: \\quad \\partial_{xx} C_{N_x-1} \\approx \\frac{2(C_{N_x-2} - C_{N_x-1})}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\n\n**Temporal Discretization:**\nWith space discretized, the system of PDEs is converted into a large system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), one for each species at each grid point. We integrate this system in time using an explicit Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS) method. For a generic concentration $C_i$ at time $t$, its value at the next time step $t+\\Delta t$ is given by:\n$$\nC_i(t+\\Delta t) = C_i(t) + \\Delta t \\left( D \\cdot (\\text{Laplacian}_i) + \\text{Reaction}_i \\right)\n$$\nThe explicit nature of this method imposes a stability constraint on the time step $\\Delta t$, known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. For the diffusion part, this condition is $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D}$. To ensure stability for the entire system, we choose a time step based on the largest diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\text{max}} = \\max(D_W, D_E)$, with a safety factor:\n$$\n\\Delta t = 0.45 \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{D_{\\text{max}}}\n$$\nThis ensures the numerical scheme remains stable throughout the simulation. For the case where the maximum diffusion coefficient is zero, a small, fixed time step is chosen that is known to be stable for the reaction kinetics alone.\n\n**Interface Position and Classification:**\nThe interface between the dorsal ($W$-dominant) and ventral ($E$-dominant) domains is defined as the unique spatial location $x_{\\text{if}}$ where the concentrations are equal, i.e., $W(x_{\\text{if}}, t) = E(x_{\\text{if}}, t)$, or equivalently, where the difference $f(x,t) = W(x,t) - E(x,t)$ crosses zero. On our discrete grid, we locate the index $i$ where the sign of $f_i$ changes (i.e., $f_i \\cdot f_{i+1} < 0$). We then use linear interpolation between points $(x_i, f_i)$ and $(x_{i+1}, f_{i+1})$ to find a more precise, sub-grid estimate of the zero-crossing. If no such sign change exists, the interface has been lost, typically because one species has outcompeted the other across the entire domain.\n\nTo classify the boundary's stability, we measure its velocity at late times. We calculate the interface position at $t_1 = 0.9T$ and at the final time $t_2=T$. The average speed over this interval is $v = (x_{\\text{if}}(t_2) - x_{\\text{if}}(t_1))/(t_2 - t_1)$.\n- If the interface is found at both times and its speed magnitude $|v|$ is less than a tolerance $\\varepsilon_x$, the boundary is classified as \"stable boundary\" (True).\n- If $|v| \\ge \\varepsilon_x$ or if the interface is lost at either $t_1$ or $t_2$, it is classified as a \"traveling front\" (False).\n\nThe provided test cases explore the effect of production biases and diffusion.\n- **Case A** $(\\alpha_W=0.8, \\alpha_E=0.8, D_E=10^{-5})$: Symmetrical biases should pin the front, leading to a stable boundary.\n- **Case B** $(\\alpha_W=0.9, \\alpha_E=0.7, D_E=10^{-5})$: A stronger bias for $W$ should cause the front to travel towards the ventral side ($x > 0.5$).\n- **Case C** $(\\alpha_W=0.6, \\alpha_E=0.9, D_E=10^{-5})$: A stronger bias for $E$ should cause the front to travel towards the dorsal side ($x < 0.5$).\n- **Case D** $(\\alpha_W=0.8, \\alpha_E=0.8, D_E=0)$: Symmetrical biases but with an immobile repressor $E$. The lack of diffusion for $E$ will sharpen its profile, but the balanced production bias is expected to maintain a stable boundary.\nThe program will implement this full numerical procedure for each test case and report the classification.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the reaction-diffusion system for dorso-ventral limb patterning\n    and classifies boundary stability for several parameter sets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Fixed Parameters ---\n    L = 1.0          # Domain length\n    x0 = 0.5         # Center of pre-pattern\n    lam = 0.02       # Width of pre-pattern transition\n    Nx = 256         # Number of spatial grid points\n    DW = 1e-3        # Diffusion coefficient for Wnt7a\n    n = 2.0          # Hill exponent for E repression\n    m = 2.0          # Hill exponent for W repression\n    KE = 0.5         # Half-repression threshold for E\n    KW = 0.5         # Half-repression threshold for W\n    muW = 1.0        # Degradation rate for W\n    muE = 1.0        # Degradation rate for E\n    rhoW0 = 2.0      # Basal production amplitude for W\n    rhoE0 = 2.0      # Basal production amplitude for E\n    Whi = 1.8        # Initial high concentration for W\n    Wlo = 0.1        # Initial low concentration for W\n    Ehi = 1.8        # Initial high concentration for E\n    Elo = 0.1        # Initial low concentration for E\n    T = 10.0         # Total simulation time\n    epsilon_x = 0.002 # Speed tolerance for stability classification\n\n    # --- Spatial Discretization ---\n    x = np.linspace(0, L, Nx)\n    dx = L / (Nx -
