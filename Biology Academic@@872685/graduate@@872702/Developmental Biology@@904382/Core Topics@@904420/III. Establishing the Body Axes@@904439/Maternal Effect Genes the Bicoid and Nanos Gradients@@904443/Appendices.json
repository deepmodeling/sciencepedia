This can be rewritten as $\\frac{e^{x_T/\\lambda}}{\\langle A \\rangle V\\tau \\lambda^2}(x_T^2 - 2\\lambda x_T + 2\\lambda^2)$. The quadratic term $(x_T-\\lambda)^2+\\lambda^2$ is always positive. Therefore, the first term is positive for all $\\lambda > 0$. The second term, $2\\eta_A^2$, is also positive. So, $g'(\\lambda) > 0$ for all $\\lambda > 0$.\nThis means that $g(\\lambda)$ is a monotonically increasing function. Since $g(x_T/2) > 0$ and the function is increasing, the root $\\lambda^{**}$ where $g(\\lambda^{**}) = 0$ must be less than $x_T/2$.\nThus, adding extrinsic noise shifts the optimal $\\lambda$ to a smaller value.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D.
