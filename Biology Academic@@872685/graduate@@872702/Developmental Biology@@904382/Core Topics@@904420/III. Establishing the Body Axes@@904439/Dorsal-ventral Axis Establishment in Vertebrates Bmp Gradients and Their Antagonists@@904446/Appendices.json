It describes a standard competitive binding equilibrium, which can be solved using the law of mass action and conservation principles. The problem is valid.\n\nWe begin by establishing the mathematical framework for the competitive binding of two ligands, Bone Morphogenetic Protein $2$ (BMP$2$) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein $4$ (BMP$4$), to a single antagonist, Chordin ($C$). Let the ligands be denoted as $L_1 \\equiv \\mathrm{BMP2}$ and $L_2 \\equiv \\mathrm{BMP4}$. All concentrations are denoted by square brackets, e.g., $[L_1]$ for the free concentration of $L_1$. Total concentrations are indicated with a subscript $T$.\n\nThe system is governed by two sets of equations: the law of mass action at equilibrium and the conservation of mass.\n\nThe dissociation constants are given as:\n$$K_{d,1} = \\frac{[L_1][C]}{[L_1C]} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K_{d,2} = \\frac{[L_2][C]}{[L_2C]}$$\nThe problem states that $K_{d,1} = K_{d,2} = K_d$. Thus, we can write the concentrations of the bound complexes as:\n$$[L_1C] = \\frac{[L_1][C]}{K_d}$$\n$$[L_2C] = \\frac{[L_2][C]}{K_d}$$\n\nThe conservation of mass for each species is:\n$$[L_1]_T = [L_1] + [L_1C]$$\n$$[L_2]_T = [L_2] + [L_2C]$$\n$$[C]_T = [C] + [L_1C] + [L_2C]$$\n\nOur goal is to find the sum of free ligand concentrations, $S \\equiv [L_1] + [L_2]$, as a function of the total concentrations and $K_d$. The central unknown linking these equations is the free Chordin concentration, $[C]$.\n\nFirst, we express the free ligand concentrations in terms of $[C]$. From the conservation of $L_1$:\n$$[L_1]_T = [L_1] + \\frac{[L_1][C]}{K_d} = [L_1] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[C]}{K_d} \\right) = [L_1] \\frac{K_d + [C]}{K_d}$$\nSolving for $[L_1]$ yields:\n$$[L_1] = \\frac{K_d [L_1]_T}{K_d + [C]}$$\nSimilarly for $L_2$:\n$$[L_2] = \\frac{K_d [L_2]_T}{K_d + [C]}$$\n\nNext, we derive an equation for $[C]$ by substituting expressions for the bound complexes into the Chordin conservation equation.

Applying the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, with $x=[C]$, $a=1$, $b = K_d + L_T - [C]_T$, and $c = -K_d [C]_T$, we take the positive root:\n$$[C] = \\frac{-(K_d + L_T - [C]_T) + \\sqrt{(K_d + L_T - [C]_T)^2 + 4 K_d [C]_T}}{2}$$\n\nThe sum of free ligands is:\n$$S = [L_1] + [L_2] = \\frac{K_d [L_1]_T}{K_d + [C]} + \\frac{K_d [L_2]_T}{K_d + [C]} = \\frac{K_d ([L_1]_T + [L_2]_T)}{K_d + [C]} = \\frac{K_d L_T}{K_d + [C]}$$\n\nWe now apply this general solution to the specific conditions at the dorsal and ventral positions.\nThe given parameters are:\n$K_d = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$[L_1]_T = [\\mathrm{BMP2}]_T = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$[L_2]_T = [\\mathrm{BMP4}]_T = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\nThus, the total ligand concentration is $L_T = [L_1]_T + [L_2]_T = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 3.0\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nCase 1: Dorsal position\nTotal Chordin: $[C]_T^{\\mathrm{dorsal}} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\nThe coefficient $b$ for the quadratic equation is $b = 1.0 + 5.0 - 10.0 = -4.0$.\nThe quadratic equation for $[C]^{\\mathrm{dorsal}}$ is:\n$([C]^{\\mathrm{dorsal}})^2 - 4.0 [C]^{\\mathrm{dorsal}} - (1.0)(10.0) = 0 \\implies ([C]^{\\mathrm{dorsal}})^2 - 4.0 [C]^{\\mathrm{dorsal}} - 10.0 = 0$.\nSolving for $[C]^{\\mathrm{dorsal}}$:\n$$[C]^{\\mathrm{dorsal}} = \\frac{4.0 + \\sqrt{(-4.0)^2 - 4(1)(-10.0)}}{2} = \\frac{4.0 + \\sqrt{16.0 + 40.0}}{2} = \\frac{4.0 + \\sqrt{56.0}}{2} = 2.0 + \\sqrt{14.0}$$\nThe sum of free ligands at the dorsal position is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{dorsal}} = \\frac{K_d L_T}{K_d + [C]^{\\mathrm{dorsal}}} = \\frac{(1.0)(5.0)}{1.0 + (2.0 + \\sqrt{14.0})} = \\frac{5.0}{3.0 + \\sqrt{14.0}}$$\n\nCase 2: Ventral position\nTotal Chordin: $[C]_T^{\\mathrm{ventral}} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\nThe coefficient $b$ for the quadratic equation is $b = 1.0 + 5.0 - 0.50 = 5.5$.\nThe quadratic equation for $[C]^{\\mathrm{ventral}}$ is:\n$([C]^{\\mathrm{ventral}})^2 + 5.5 [C]^{\\mathrm{ventral}} - (1.0)(0.50) = 0 \\implies ([C]^{\\mathrm{ventral}})^2 + 5.5 [C]^{\\mathrm{ventral}} - 0.50 = 0$.\nSolving for $[C]^{\\mathrm{ventral}}$:\n$$[C]^{\\mathrm{ventral}} = \\frac{-5.5 + \\sqrt{(5.5)^2 - 4(1)(-0.50)}}{2} = \\frac{-5.5 + \\sqrt{30.25 + 2.0}}{2} = \\frac{-5.5 + \\sqrt{32.25}}{2}$$\nThe sum of free ligands at the ventral position is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ventral}} = \\frac{K_d L_T}{K_d + [C]^{\\mathrm{ventral}}} = \\frac{(1.0)(5.0)}{1.0 + \\frac{-5.5 + \\sqrt{32.25}}{2}} = \\frac{5.0}{\\frac{2.0 - 5.5 + \\sqrt{32.25}}{2}} = \\frac{10.0}{\\sqrt{32.25} - 3.5}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{dorsal}}}{S_{\\mathrm{ventral}}} = \\frac{\\frac{5.0}{3.0 + \\sqrt{14.0}}}{\\frac{10.0}{\\sqrt{32.25} - 3.5}} = \\frac{5.0}{10.0} \\frac{\\sqrt{32.25} - 3.5}{3.0 + \\sqrt{14.0}}$$\n$$R = 0.5 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{32.25} - 3.5}{3.0 + \\sqrt{14.0}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$\\sqrt{14.0} \\approx 3.741657$\n$\\sqrt{32.25} \\approx 5.678908$\n$$R \\approx 0.5 \\times \\frac{5.678908 - 3.5}{3.0 + 3.741657} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{2.178908}{6.741657} \\approx 0.5 \\times 0.323194 \\approx 0.161597$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.1616$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.1616} $$", "id": "2632017"}, {"introduction": "Moving from simple binding to a dynamic biological context, this practice explores the logic of a complex regulatory network. In a living embryo, the core BMP-Chordin interaction is modulated by other factors that form feedback loops, such as the Tolloid protease and its inhibitor, Sizzled.

This extracellular gradient is shaped by secreted antagonists such as Chordin and Noggin, and by proteolysis: Tolloid-family metalloproteases cleave Chordin to release active BMPs. In zebrafish, Sizzled is a secreted Frizzled-related protein (sFRP) expressed ventrally in response to BMP signaling and is known, in vertebrates, to bind and inhibit Tolloid proteases, thereby stabilizing Chordin.

The roles of BMP, pSmad, Chordin, Tolloid, and Sizzled are accurately represented as per the established scientific literature. The system forms a coherent and well-studied regulatory network.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem defines all necessary components and their interactions, establishing a clear regulatory logic. It poses a question about the effect of a specific perturbation (loss-of-function) on this system. The initial state is defined, and the perturbation is precise, allowing for a unique, logical deduction.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem uses standard, precise terminology from genetics and developmental biology. It is free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, permitting a rigorous, principle-based solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a deduction based on the provided regulatory network. We must first understand the role of Sizzled in the wild-type embryo.\n\n1.  **Establish the Core Axis:** The fundamental D-V axis is established by opposing gradients. The dorsal organizer secretes BMP antagonists, primarily Chordin. This creates a low-BMP/low-pSmad1/5 environment dorsally, specifying dorsal fates (e.g., neural plate, notochord). Conversely, the ventral side has high BMP activity and high pSmad1/5 levels, specifying ventral fates (e.g., epidermis, blood progenitors).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Tolloid-Chordin Interaction:** Tolloid is a protease that degrades Chordin. By degrading Chordin, Tolloid effectively promotes BMP signaling because it removes an inhibitor of BMP. Therefore, Tolloid activity expands the domain of high BMP signaling.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Role of Sizzled:** Sizzled is expressed ventrally, where BMP signaling is highest. The problem states that Sizzled inhibits Tolloid. By inhibiting Tolloid, Sizzled prevents the degradation of Chordin. This means Sizzled activity helps to protect and stabilize Chordin.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Full Regulatory Loop:** A negative feedback loop exists. High BMP signaling (ventral) $\\rightarrow$ induces *sizzled* expression $\\rightarrow$ Sizzled protein inhibits Tolloid $\\rightarrow$ Tolloid cannot degrade Chordin efficiently $\\rightarrow$ stable Chordin can diffuse and inhibit BMP signaling. This feedback mechanism serves to sharpen and maintain the boundary of the BMP gradient. It prevents the high-BMP ventral domain from encroaching too far into the dorsal territory. Sizzled essentially \"dampens\" the pro-BMP effect of Tolloid on the ventral side, thereby reinforcing the low-BMP state more dorsally.\n\n5.  **Predict the Consequence of *sizzled* Loss-of-Function (LOF):**\n    - In a *sizzled* LOF mutant, the Sizzled protein is absent or non-functional.\n    - The inhibition on Tolloid is removed.\n    - Tolloid proteases become hyperactive throughout their expression/activity domain.\n    - This hyperactivity leads to increased and more widespread degradation of the BMP antagonist, Chordin.\n    - With less functional Chordin, BMP signaling is less inhibited.\n    - Consequently, the overall level of BMP activity in the embryo will increase. The gradient of pSmad1/5 will shift. Specifically, the region of high pSmad1/5 will expand from the ventral side towards the dorsal side. The dorsal domain, characterized by low pSmad1/5, will shrink.\n\n6.  **Predict the Phenotypic Outcome:**\n    - Dorsal-ventral fates are specified by the level of BMP signaling. High BMP specifies ventral fates; low BMP specifies dorsal fates.\n    - An expansion and elevation of the pSmad1/5 gradient signifies that many cells that would normally be in a low- or intermediate-BMP environment will now experience high BMP signaling.\n    - This will cause a respecification of cell fates. Dorsal and lateral fates will be lost in favor of ventral fates.\n    - The resulting embryonic phenotype is known as **ventralization**: an expansion of ventral structures (like tail fin and blood) at the expense of dorsal structures (like the head, eyes, and notochord).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. pSmad1/5 levels are elevated and broadened toward the dorsal side, shrinking the low-BMP dorsal domain; embryos are ventralized with expansion of ventral fates and loss of dorsal organizer derivatives.**\n- This statement accurately describes the deduced molecular and phenotypic consequences. Loss of Sizzled leads to hyperactive Tolloid, increased Chordin degradation, elevated and expanded BMP/pSmad1/5 signaling, and consequently, a ventralized phenotype.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. pSmad1/5 levels are reduced and restricted to a narrower ventral domain, enlarging the low-BMP dorsal territory; embryos are dorsalized with expansion of organizer derivatives and loss of ventral structures.**\n- This describes the opposite outcome. A reduction in pSmad1/5 would result from increased Chordin stability, which would occur in a *sizzled* gain-of-function or *tolloid* loss-of-function scenario. This describes a dorsalized phenotype.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. pSmad1/5 distribution is unchanged due to complete compensation by other antagonists (Noggin and Follistatin), yielding essentially wild-type D–V patterning.**\n- While biological systems exhibit redundancy, assuming \"complete compensation\" to yield a wild-type phenotype is contrary to the premise of a problem that asks for the effect of a specific gene's loss. The provided regulatory pathway implies a significant role for Sizzled. Experimental data confirms that *sizzled* mutants are not wild-type. Therefore, this option is based on an unsupported assumption.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. pSmad1/5 becomes highest at the dorsal organizer while remaining high ventrally, creating a bimodal profile; embryos retain both dorsal and ventral structures but lose intermediate (lateral) fates due to a split peak in BMP signaling.**\n- The described mechanism does not support the creation of a new, ectopic peak of BMP signaling at the dorsal organizer. The organizer is the source of BMP antagonists (Chordin). The loss of Sizzled enhances the degradation of these antagonists, causing the ventral high-BMP zone to expand, not creating a new dorsal peak.

A morphogen gradient is not just a static pattern; it must be established and maintained reliably, often in tissues of varying sizes—a property known as scaling.

Consider a simplified one-dimensional steady-state model for the BMP concentration $c(x)$ along the dorsal-ventral axis of an embryo of length $L$, with $x$ measured from the ventral side ($x=0$) to the dorsal side ($x=L$). Assume BMP diffuses with diffusion coefficient $D$ and is removed by first-order processes with rate constant $k$, and that there is a constant net BMP influx at the ventral boundary. A minimal steady-state description is\n$$0 = D \\frac{d^{2}c}{dx^{2}} - k\\,c \\quad \\text{for } 0  x  L,$$\nwith boundary conditions representing a fixed ventral influx and a dorsal no-flux condition:\n$$-D\\,\\left.\\frac{dc}{dx}\\right|_{x=0} = J, \\quad \\left.\\frac{dc}{dx}\\right|_{x=L} = 0,$$\nwhere $J0$ is the constant BMP influx at $x=0$.

Which statement best describes what is expected in this model, and whether proportionate scaling of the gradient with embryo size should occur in the absence of additional feedback mechanisms?\n\nA. With fixed $D$ and $k$, the steady-state gradient has a characteristic length that does not depend on $L$, so doubling $L$ leaves $c(x)$ versus $x$ essentially unchanged near the source but compresses the profile when plotted versus $x/L$; therefore, proportionate scaling is not expected without additional feedback.\n\nB. Doubling $L$ doubles the gradient’s characteristic length because the diffusion distance increases, so the profile stretches proportionally and scales with the embryo even without feedback.\n\nC. When $L$ is doubled, the peak concentration $c(0)$ doubles because a larger domain accumulates more BMP, and the shape versus $x/L$ remains identical, implying autonomous scaling.\n\nD. Without feedback, the dorsal boundary at $x=L$ enforces a conserved total BMP amount that keeps $c(x)$ invariant in $x/L$, so perfect scaling is expected upon doubling $L$.\n\nE.

Let $C(\\xi) = c(x=\\xi L)$.\n$$ C(\\xi) = \\frac{J\\lambda}{D} \\frac{\\cosh((L-\\xi L)/\\lambda)}{\\sinh(L/\\lambda)} = \\frac{J\\lambda}{D} \\frac{\\cosh((1-\\xi)L/\\lambda)}{\\sinh(L/\\lambda)} $$\nThe shape of this normalized profile $C(\\xi)$ depends explicitly on the ratio $L/\\lambda$. If we change $L$ to $2L$, the new profile, as a function of relative position, will be different. Therefore, this model does not exhibit proportionate scaling.\n\nNow, consider the effect of doubling $L$ to $2L$ on the absolute profile $c(x)$. The new profile is $c_{new}(x) = \\frac{J\\lambda}{D} \\frac{\\cosh((2L-x)/\\lambda)}{\\sinh(2L/\\lambda)}$.\nIn the common biological regime where the embryo is much larger than the decay length ($L \\gg \\lambda$), we can approximate the hyperbolic functions for large arguments. For $L/\\lambda \\gg 1$, $\\sinh(L/\\lambda) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}e^{L/\\lambda}$. Also, $\\cosh((L-x)/\\lambda) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}e^{(L-x)/\\lambda}$.\n$$ c(x) \\approx \\frac{J\\lambda}{D} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}e^{(L-x)/\\lambda}}{\\frac{1}{2}e^{L/\\lambda}} = \\frac{J\\lambda}{D} e^{-x/\\lambda} $$\nThis is a simple exponential decay from the source. When $L$ is doubled to $2L$ (and $2L \\gg \\lambda$), the profile near the source ($x \\ll 2L$) is also approximately $c_{new}(x) \\approx \\frac{J\\lambda}{D} e^{-x/\\lambda}$. Thus, for positions $x$ not too close to the dorsal boundary, the concentration profile $c(x)$ as a function of absolute distance $x$ is essentially unchanged.\n\nWhen this fixed-shape profile is plotted against the relative coordinate $x/L$, the decay that occurs over the absolute distance $\\lambda$ now occupies a smaller fraction of the total length ($x/L$ becomes $x/(2L)$). This results in a profile that appears compressed towards the source at $x=0$ on the normalized axis.\n\n**Option-by-Option Evaluation**\n\n**A. With fixed $D$ and $k$, the steady-state gradient has a characteristic length that does not depend on $L$, so doubling $L$ leaves $c(x)$ versus $x$ essentially unchanged near the source but compresses the profile when plotted versus $x/L$; therefore, proportionate scaling is not expected without additional feedback.**\nThis statement is a perfect summary of our findings. The characteristic length is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$, independent of $L$. The profile $c(x)$ versus $x$ is robust to changes in $L$ near the source. The profile plotted versus $x/L$ is not invariant (it compresses), meaning proportionate scaling fails. The need for additional mechanisms for scaling is a correct implication.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Doubling $L$ doubles the gradient’s characteristic length because the diffusion distance increases, so the profile stretches proportionally and scales with the embryo even without feedback.**\nThis is incorrect. The characteristic length $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ is determined by reaction and diffusion parameters, not the domain size $L$. Consequently, the profile does not stretch proportionally, and the system fails to scale.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. When $L$ is doubled, the peak concentration $c(0)$ doubles because a larger domain accumulates more BMP, and the shape versus $x/L$ remains identical, implying autonomous scaling.**\nThis is incorrect on two counts. First, the peak concentration $c(0) = \\frac{J\\lambda}{D}\\coth(L/\\lambda)$ *decreases* when $L$ is doubled, as $\\coth(z)$ is a decreasing function for $z0$. A larger domain offers more volume for degradation, lowering the steady-state concentration for a fixed influx. Second, the shape versus $x/L$ is not identical, as shown in the derivation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Without feedback, the dorsal boundary at $x=L$ enforces a conserved total BMP amount that keeps $c(x)$ invariant in $x/L$, so perfect scaling is expected upon doubling $L$.**\nThe premise that the total BMP amount is conserved is surprisingly correct. Integrating the governing equation from $0$ to $L$ gives $\\int_0^L k c(x) dx = \\int_0^L D c''(x) dx = D[c'(L) - c'(0)] = D[0 - (-J/D)] = J$. The total amount is $\\int_0^L c(x) dx = J/k$, which is a constant independent of $L$. However, the conclusion is flawed. Having a constant amount of morphogen in a domain of increasing size is precisely the reason for the *failure* to scale. For scaling to occur, the profile shape in relative coordinates must be constant, which would imply the total amount scales proportionally with $L$. This statement draws the wrong conclusion from a correct (but subtle) premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Introducing BMP antagonists like Chordin without any feedback control automatically adjusts the effective transport to make the profile scale perfectly with embryo size for any parameter values.**\nThis option speculates about mechanisms (antagonists) not included in the specified model. The question is about the behavior *of the given model*. Furthermore, the claim that antagonists \"automatically\" and \"for any parameter values\" ensure perfect scaling is a vast oversimplification and is generally not true. While certain antagonist-based models can achieve scaling, it is not a universal or automatic property.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2632022"}]}
