The evolution of the surface concentration field of PAR proteins, $c(x,t)$, along a one-dimensional cortical coordinate $x$ is described by the advection-diffusion equation. For a conserved scalar quantity, the continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the total flux of the protein. The flux consists of two components: an advective flux due to the cortical flow, $J_{\\text{adv}} = vc$, and a diffusive flux due to random thermal motion, $J_{\\text{diff}} = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$, as given by Fick's first law. The speed of the uniform cortical flow is $v$ and the diffusion coefficient is $D$.\n\nThe total flux is $J = vc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$. Substituting this into the continuity equation, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( vc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right) = 0\n$$\nAssuming the flow speed $v$ and diffusion coefficient $D$ are constant in space, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental advection-diffusion equation for the system.\n\nTo identify the dimensionless control parameter, we nondimensionalize this equation. We introduce dimensionless variables for space, time, and concentration. Let $c_0$ be a characteristic concentration. Following the problem statement, we define the dimensionless spatial coordinate $\\tilde{x}$ using the characteristic half-length $L$:\n$$\n\\tilde{x} = \\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, should reflect advective transport across the half-length $L$. This time scale is naturally $\\tau = \\frac{L}{v}$. We define the dimensionless time $\\tilde{t}$ as:\n$$\n\\tilde{t} = \\frac{t}{\\tau} = \\frac{t}{L/v} = \\frac{vt}{L}\n$$\nLet us also define a dimensionless concentration $\\tilde{c}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{c} = \\frac{c}{c_0}\n$$\nNow, we transform the derivatives using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\frac{v}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{t}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{x}}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the advection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{v}{L} \\frac{\\partial (c_0 \\tilde{c})}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + v \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial (c_0 \\tilde{c})}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = D \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 (c_0 \\tilde{c})}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nSince $c_0$ is a constant, it can be factored out:\n$$\nc_0 \\frac{v}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + c_0 \\frac{v}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = c_0 \\frac{D}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nWe can divide the entire equation by the factor $c_0 \\frac{v}{L}$ to make it dimensionless:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = \\left(\\frac{D}{L^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{v}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficient of the second derivative term gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = \\left(\\frac{D}{vL}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nIn this dimensionless form, the coefficients of the terms are pure numbers. The parameter comparing advective to diffusive transport is the ratio of their respective term strengths. In our chosen scaling, the strength of the advective transport term is normalized to $1$. The strength of the diffusive transport is given by the coefficient $\\frac{D}{vL}$. The single dimensionless parameter that compares advection to diffusion is the inverse of this coefficient, known as the Péclet number, $Pe$:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{vL}{D}\n$$\nThis parameter represents the ratio of the rate of advective transport to the rate of diffusive transport. A large $Pe$ indicates that advection dominates, while a small $Pe$ indicates that diffusion dominates. This can also be seen by comparing the characteristic time scales for diffusion over length $L$, $t_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{L^2}{D}$, and for advection over the same length, $t_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{L}{v}$. Their ratio is $Pe = \\frac{t_{\\text{diff}}}{t_{\\text{adv}}}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the Péclet number using the provided data:\n- Cortical flow speed: $v = 0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Characteristic half-length: $L = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- PAR protein cortical diffusion coefficient: $D = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the Péclet number:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{(0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})}{0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nThe units cancel out as expected: $\\frac{(\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}) \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}} = 1$.\nThe numerical value is:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{0.3 \\times 25}{0.1} = \\frac{7.5}{0.1} = 75\n$$\nThe Péclet number for this system is $75$. This large value indicates that advective transport by cortical flow is strongly dominant over diffusion in the segregation of PAR proteins along the anterior-posterior axis of the *C. elegans* embryo.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{75}\n$$", "id": "2621443"}, {"introduction": "Having established that PAR protein segregation is an advection-dominated process, a key skill for a developmental biologist is interpreting experimental data that visualizes these dynamics.

A common way to quantify cortical dynamics is a kymograph constructed along the embryo cortex, where the slope of features reports cortical velocity and fluorescence intensity reports local abundance of tagged proteins.\n\nYou acquire simultaneous time-lapse imaging of Non-Muscle Myosin II (NMY-2)::mKate to measure cortical flows and green fluorescent protein (GFP)::PAR-2 to monitor posterior domain formation.

Advection (flow) transports already-bound proteins but cannot increase the total amount if recruitment is the rate-limiting step.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in established concepts of developmental biology and biophysics, it is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to determine a solution. The core task is to identify perturbations that cause a \"defect in recruitment rather than a defect in flow,\" which is consistent with the observations of normal flow velocity ($v$) but delayed PAR-2 accumulation. The delay in accumulation is directly related to the net rate of membrane binding, which is governed by the reaction term, $k_{\\mathrm{on}} C_{\\mathrm{cyto}} - k_{\\mathrm{off}} I$. A defect in recruitment implies a reduction in the effective on-rate, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, or an increase in the effective off-rate, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. A defect in flow would manifest as a change in the advection term, primarily through the velocity $v$.\n\nThe experimental observations are key: $v$ is normal, but PAR-2 accumulation is slow. This strongly indicates that the advection term, $v\\,\\partial I/\\partial x$, is functioning normally, while the reaction term, representing recruitment, is impaired. We must now evaluate each option against this conclusion.\n\n**Option A: A point mutation that neutralizes the basic membrane-binding patch of PAR-2, reducing its affinity for acidic phospholipids and lowering $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ without altering actomyosin contractility.**\nThis perturbation directly targets the a priori membrane binding capability of the PAR-2 protein itself. A reduced affinity for the membrane is modeled as a reduction in the on-rate for membrane association, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$. According to the governing equation, a lower $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ will slow down the rate of increase of cortical concentration $I$, leading to a delay in accumulation, which is precisely the observation of an increased time to half-maximum intensity ($\\Delta t \\approx 90\\,\\mathrm{s}$). The option explicitly states that actomyosin contractility is unaltered, which is consistent with the observed unchanged flow velocity $v$. Therefore, this describes a pure recruitment defect with normal flow.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B: Partial depletion of Non-Muscle Myosin II (NMY-2) that reduces acto-myosin contractility, halving cortical flow speed to $v \\approx 0.17\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.**\nThis option describes a direct perturbation to the motor protein NMY-2, which generates the cortical flow. This is a classic \"defect in flow.\" The predicted outcome is a halved flow speed ($v \\approx 0.17\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). This directly contradicts the experimental observation that \"cortical flow velocity is unchanged, with measured slope corresponding to a speed of $v \\approx 0.35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\"\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: Depletion of the B55 regulatory subunit SUR-6 of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), causing sustained PKC-3–dependent phosphorylation of PAR-2 and thereby decreasing the fraction competent for membrane binding at the posterior.**\nThis perturbation affects the signaling pathway that regulates PAR-2 activity. PP2A is a phosphatase, and its depletion would lead to hyperphosphorylation of its substrates. The problem states that PKC-3 phosphorylates PAR-2, and the foundational base implies this phosphorylation inhibits membrane binding. By removing a phosphatase that would normally counteract PKC-3, PAR-2 remains phosphorylated and thus less able to bind to the membrane. This is equivalent to reducing the effective on-rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ or increasing the off-rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. This is a recruitment defect. Since the perturbation targets a signaling component upstream of membrane binding, and not the actomyosin cortex itself, it is expected that the cortical flow velocity $v$ would be unaffected. This scenario is consistent with the observations of delayed PAR-2 accumulation and normal flow velocity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option D: Reduction of centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin that delays posterior astral microtubule growth, transiently impairing the microtubule-dependent protection of PAR-2 from PKC-3 at the posterior cortex during the onset of polarity.**\nThis perturbation affects microtubule dynamics. The foundational base explicitly states that posterior microtubules promote PAR-2 membrane association by antagonizing PKC-3. A delay in the growth of these microtubules would thus delay this protective effect. Consequently, PAR-2 would be transiently hyperphosphorylated by PKC-3, impairing its ability to bind the membrane. This impairment corresponds to a transient decrease in the effective $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ or increase in $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, leading to a delay in PAR-2 accumulation. As the microtubules eventually grow, the protection is established, and PAR-2 can accumulate, consistent with the observation that the final boundary is normal. The perturbation affects microtubules, which are not the direct drivers of cortical flow (actomyosin is). Thus, it is expected that the flow velocity $v$ is unchanged. This describes a recruitment defect consistent with all observations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option E: A twofold increase in cortical viscosity that leaves measured $v$ unchanged in the kymograph but is expected to slow advection-dominated segregation and thus delay PAR-2 accumulation even if recruitment kinetics are normal.**\nThis option contains a physical contradiction. Cortical flow is governed by a force balance, where the velocity $v$ is proportional to the driving force (from actomyosin) and inversely proportional to the viscosity. If viscosity doubles, $v$ must be halved unless the driving force also doubles, an unstated and highly specific condition. The statement \"leaves measured $v$ unchanged\" is a premise, but the subsequent claim that this \"is expected to slow advection-dominated segregation\" is logically false, as the speed of advection *is* $v$. Even if we disregard this contradiction and accept the premise of unchanged $v$ with increased viscosity, this perturbation is fundamentally a modification of the physical properties of the cortex, i.e., the medium of the flow. It is therefore categorized as a flow-related property change, not a defect in the biochemical process of recruitment (i.e., kinetics described by $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$). The problem specifically asks for a defect \"in recruitment rather than a defect in flow.\"\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, options A, C, and D describe perturbations that specifically impair the recruitment of PAR-2 to the membrane without affecting the cortical flow machinery, consistent with the experimental evidence of normal flow velocity but delayed PAR-2 accumulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2621525"}, {"introduction": "The previous practice highlighted the critical distinction between transport and recruitment.

The algorithm for each test case $(t_{1/2}, M, A_\\mathrm{slow})$ is:\n1.  Calculate the observed rate $k_\\mathrm{obs} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}$.\n2.  Calculate the equilibrium bound fraction $f_b = \\frac{A_\\mathrm{slow}}{M}$.\n3.  Calculate the on-rate $k_\\mathrm{on} = f_b \\cdot k_\\mathrm{obs}$.\n4.  Calculate the off-rate $k_\\mathrm{off} = (1 - f_b) \\cdot k_\\mathrm{obs}$.\n5.  Round the results for $k_\\mathrm{on}$ and $k_\\mathrm{off}$ to $6$ decimal places.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented to solve the given test suite.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Infers the on-rate (k_on) and off-rate (k_off) of protein binding\n    from FRAP data using a two-state kinetic model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (t_half_in_seconds, mobile_fraction_M, slow_amplitude_A_slow)\n    test_cases = [\n        (8.0, 0.85, 0.51),    # Case 1: Control-like\n        (16.0, 0.92, 0.736),   # Case 2: PKC-3 inhibited\n        (3.0, 0.95, 0.095),    # Case 3: Fast exchange with weak binding\n        (10.0, 0.40, 0.20),    # Case 4: High immobile fraction, balanced exchange\n        (20.0, 1.00, 0.90),    # Case 5: Nearly fully mobile, strong binding\n    ]\n\n    ln_2 = np.log(2)\n    results = []\n\n    for t_half, M, A_slow in test_cases:\n        # The problem guarantees M > 0 and t_half > 0.\n\n        # Calculate the observed rate constant (k_obs) from the half-time.\n        # k_obs = ln(2) / t_half\n        k_obs = ln_2 / t_half\n\n        # Calculate the exchangeable bound fraction at steady state (f_b).\n        # f_b = A_slow / M\n        f_b = A_slow / M\n\n        # Calculate the on-rate (k_on) and off-rate (k_off).\n        # k_on = f_b * k_obs\n        # k_off = (1 - f_b) * k_obs\n        k_on = k_obs * f_b\n        k_off = k_obs * (1 - f_b)\n\n        results.append([k_on, k_off])\n\n    # Format the results into the required string format.\n    # Each inner list [k_on, k_off] is formatted as a string with numbers\n    # rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    formatted_results = [f\"[{r[0]:.6f},{r[1]:.6f}]\" for r in results]\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The output is a single string that represents a list of lists.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "2621447"}]}
