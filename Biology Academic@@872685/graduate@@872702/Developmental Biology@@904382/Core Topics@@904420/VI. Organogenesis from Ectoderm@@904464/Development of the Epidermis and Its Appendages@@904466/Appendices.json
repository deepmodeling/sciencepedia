This is represented as $-\\kappa r$.\n\nCombining these terms, the equation for $a(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{da}{dt} = \\alpha a - \\beta a^3 - \\eta B a - \\kappa r $$\nThis can be rearranged by grouping the linear terms in $a$:\n$$ \\frac{da}{dt} = (\\alpha - \\eta B)a - \\beta a^3 - \\kappa r $$\n\nFor the regression activity $r(t)$:\n-   It is induced in proportion to the anagen activity $a(t)$. This is a production term $+\\sigma a$.\n-   It undergoes first-order decay with rate constant $\\delta$. This is a removal term $-\\delta r$.\n\nCombining these terms, the equation for $r(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\sigma a - \\delta r $$\nThe complete two-dimensional system is thus:\n$$ \\frac{da}{dt} = (\\alpha - \\eta B)a - \\beta a^3 - \\kappa r $$\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\sigma a - \\delta r $$\n\nStep $2$: Calculation of the non-zero steady state.\n\nThe steady state of the system, denoted as $(a^{\\ast}, r^{\\ast})$, is found by setting the time derivatives to zero: $\\frac{da}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 0$.\nFrom the second equation:\n$$ \\sigma a^{\\ast} - \\delta r^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies r^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta} a^{\\ast} $$\nWe substitute this expression for $r^{\\ast}$ into the first equation set to zero:\n$$ (\\alpha - \\eta B)a^{\\ast} - \\beta (a^{\\ast})^3 - \\kappa \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta} a^{\\ast} \\right) = 0 $$\nThe problem asks for a non-zero steady state, so we may assume $a^{\\ast} \\neq 0$ and divide the equation by $a^{\\ast}$:\n$$ (\\alpha - \\eta B) - \\beta (a^{\\ast})^2 - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} = 0 $$\nWe now solve for $(a^{\\ast})^2$:\n$$ \\beta (a^{\\ast})^2 = \\alpha - \\eta B - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} $$\n$$ (a^{\\ast})^2 = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( \\alpha - \\eta B - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} \\right) $$\nFor a physically meaningful steady state, we require $a^{\\ast}$ to be a positive real number, which means $(a^{\\ast})^2 > 0$. This implies the condition $\\alpha - \\eta B - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} > 0$. The steady state values are:\n$$ a^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( \\alpha - \\eta B - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} \\right)} $$\n$$ r^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( \\alpha - \\eta B - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} \\right)} $$\n\nStep $3$: Linearization and Hopf bifurcation analysis.\n\nTo analyze the stability of the steady state $(a^{\\ast}, r^{\\ast})$, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J$, evaluated at this point.\nLet $f(a, r) = (\\alpha - \\eta B)a - \\beta a^3 - \\kappa r$ and $g(a, r) = \\sigma a - \\delta r$. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial a} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial r} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha - \\eta B - 3\\beta a^2 & -\\kappa \\\\ \\sigma & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the steady state $(a^{\\ast}, r^{\\ast})$. We use the expression for $(a^{\\ast})^2$ found in Step $2$:\n$$ \\beta (a^{\\ast})^2 = \\alpha - \\eta B - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} $$\nThe top-left element of the Jacobian at the steady state, $J_{11}^{\\ast}$, is:\n$$ J_{11}^{\\ast} = \\alpha - \\eta B - 3\\beta (a^{\\ast})^2 = (\\alpha - \\eta B) - 3\\left(\\alpha - \\eta B - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta}\\right) $$\n$$ J_{11}^{\\ast} = -2(\\alpha - \\eta B) + \\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} $$\nThe Jacobian matrix evaluated at $(a^{\\ast}, r^{\\ast})$ is therefore:\n$$ J^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2(\\alpha - \\eta B) + \\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} & -\\kappa \\\\ \\sigma & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nA Hopf bifurcation occurs when the eigenvalues of $J^{\\ast}$ are purely imaginary. For a two-dimensional system, this corresponds to two conditions on the trace ($\\text{Tr}$) and determinant ($\\det$) of the Jacobian:\n$1$. $\\text{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) = 0$\n$2$. $\\det(J^{\\ast}) > 0$\n\nThe trace of $J^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$ \\text{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) = J_{11}^{\\ast} + J_{22}^{\\ast} = \\left(-2(\\alpha - \\eta B) + \\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta}\\right) - \\delta $$\nWe set the trace to zero to find the critical BMP level, $B_{\\ast}$:\n$$ -2(\\alpha - \\eta B_{\\ast}) + \\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} - \\delta = 0 $$\nSolving for $B_{\\ast}$:\n$$ 2(\\alpha - \\eta B_{\\ast}) = \\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{\\delta} - \\delta $$\n$$ \\alpha - \\eta B_{\\ast} = \\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{2\\delta} - \\frac{\\delta}{2} $$\n$$ \\eta B_{\\ast} = \\alpha - \\left(\\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{2\\delta} - \\frac{\\delta}{2}\\right) = \\alpha - \\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{2\\delta} + \\frac{\\delta}{2} $$\n$$ B_{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\left( \\alpha + \\frac{\\delta}{2} - \\frac{3\\kappa \\sigma}{2\\delta} \\right) $$\nThis expression can be written with a common denominator:\n$$ B_{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2\\eta\\delta} (2\\alpha\\delta + \\delta^2 - 3\\kappa\\sigma) $$\nNow, we must check the second condition, $\\det(J^{\\ast}) > 0$. The determinant is:\n$$ \\det(J^{\\ast}) = (J_{11}^{\\ast})(-\\delta) - (-\\kappa)(\\sigma) = -\\delta J_{11}^{\\ast} + \\kappa\\sigma $$\nFrom the zero-trace condition, we have $J_{11}^{\\ast} - \\delta = 0$, which implies $J_{11}^{\\ast} = \\delta$. Substituting this into the determinant expression at the bifurcation point:\n$$ \\det(J^{\\ast}) = -\\delta(\\delta) + \\kappa\\sigma = \\kappa\\sigma - \\delta^2 $$\nThus, the condition for a Hopf bifurcation to occur is $\\kappa\\sigma - \\delta^2 > 0$. We assume the system parameters satisfy this condition.\n\nStep $4$: Final expression for the critical BMP level.\n\nThe final result is the analytical expression for the critical BMP level $B_{\\ast}$ at which the Hopf bifurcation occurs, inducing a limit cycle.\nThe expression derived is:\n$$ B_{\\ast} = \\frac{2\\alpha\\delta + \\delta^2 - 3\\kappa\\sigma}{2\\eta\\delta} $$\nThis is the required closed-form solution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\alpha\\delta + \\delta^2 - 3\\kappa\\sigma}{2\\eta\\delta}}\n$$", "id": "2628398"}]}
