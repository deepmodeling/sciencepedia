Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed to its solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the thickness of a tissue domain where a specific gene, Forkhead box F1 (Foxf1), is expressed above a certain threshold. The expression of this gene is controlled by the concentration of a signaling molecule, Sonic hedgehog (Shh). The spatial distribution of Shh is, in turn, governed by a reaction-diffusion process. We will solve this problem in three steps: First, determine the steady-state concentration profile of Shh, $c(x)$. Second, determine the critical concentration of Shh, $c^{\\ast}$, that corresponds to the threshold level of Foxf1 expression, $F^{\\ast}$. Third, use the concentration profile to find the position $T$ where the concentration equals this critical value.\n\nStep 1: Determine the steady-state concentration profile of Shh, $c(x)$.\nThe process is modeled in one dimension, with the splanchnic mesoderm occupying the semi-infinite domain $x > 0$. The steady-state concentration $c(x)$ of Shh is described by the diffusion equation with a first-order degradation term:\n$$ D \\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} - k c = 0 $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $k$ is the degradation rate constant. This is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution is of the form $c(x) = A \\exp(\\lambda x) + B \\exp(-\\lambda x)$, where $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$. It is more convenient to define a characteristic length scale $\\lambda_L = \\sqrt{D/k}$, so the general solution can be written as:\n$$ c(x) = A \\exp(x/\\lambda_L) + B \\exp(-x/\\lambda_L) $$\nWe apply the two boundary conditions given in the problem statement:\n1.  The concentration vanishes far from the source: $c(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. For this condition to hold, the coefficient of the exponentially growing term, $A$, must be zero. If $A \\neq 0$, the term $A \\exp(x/\\lambda_L)$ would diverge as $x \\to \\infty$. Thus, $A=0$.\n2.  The concentration at the boundary with the endoderm is fixed: $c(0) = c_0$. Applying this to the remaining solution, $c(x) = B \\exp(-x/\\lambda_L)$, we get $c(0) = B \\exp(0) = B$. Thus, $B = c_0$.\n\nCombining these results, the steady-state concentration profile for Shh is an exponential decay:\n$$ c(x) = c_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda_L) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) $$\n\nStep 2: Determine the critical Shh concentration, $c^{\\ast}$.\nThe expression of Foxf1, $F(c)$, is given by a Hill-type function:\n$$ F(c) = F_{\\max} \\frac{c^n}{K^n + c^n} $$\nSmooth muscle differentiation occurs where $F(c) \\ge F^{\\ast}$.

Negligible external load at the lateral edge: $\\sigma(L) = 0$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, $v(0)=0$:\n$$\nv(0) = C_{1} \\cosh(0) + C_{2} \\sinh(0) - \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} = C_{1} - \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} = 0\n$$\nThis gives $C_{1} = \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi}$. The solution becomes:\n$$\nv(x) = \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\cosh(\\lambda x) + C_{2} \\sinh(\\lambda x) - \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} = \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi}(\\cosh(\\lambda x) - 1) + C_{2} \\sinh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is $\\sigma(L)=0$. From the constitutive relation, this is $\\eta \\frac{dv}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} + T_{a} = 0$.\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $v(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda x) + C_{2} \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nApplying the condition at $x=L$:\n$$\n\\eta \\left( \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda L) + C_{2} \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) \\right) + T_{a} = 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for $C_{2}$:\n$$\n\\eta C_{2} \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) = -T_{a} - \\eta \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda L)\n$$\n$$\nC_{2} = -\\frac{T_{a}}{\\eta \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L)} - \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = -\\frac{T_{a}}{\\eta \\lambda} \\operatorname{sech}(\\lambda L) - \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\tanh(\\lambda L)\n$$\nNow we have the full solution for $v(x)$. The problem asks for the velocity at the lateral edge, $v(L)$. We substitute $x=L$ and the expressions for $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ into the general solution:\n$$\nv(L) = \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi}(\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1) + \\left( -\\frac{T_{a}}{\\eta \\lambda} \\operatorname{sech}(\\lambda L) - \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\tanh(\\lambda L) \\right) \\sinh(\\lambda L)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nv(L) = \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi}(\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1) - \\frac{T_{a}}{\\eta \\lambda} \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} - \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\frac{\\sinh^{2}(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)}\n$$\n$$\nv(L) = - \\frac{T_{a}}{\\eta \\lambda} \\tanh(\\lambda L) + \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\left( \\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1 - \\frac{\\sinh^{2}(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\right)\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is simplified using the identity $\\cosh^{2}(z) - \\sinh^{2}(z) = 1$:\n$$\n\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1 - \\frac{\\sinh^{2}(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = \\frac{\\cosh^{2}(\\lambda L) - \\cosh(\\lambda L) - \\sinh^{2}(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = \\frac{1 - \\cosh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = \\operatorname{sech}(\\lambda L) - 1\n$$\nSo, the expression for $v(L)$ becomes:\n$$\nv(L) = \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} (\\operatorname{sech}(\\lambda L) - 1) - \\frac{T_{a}}{\\eta \\lambda} \\tanh(\\lambda L)\n$$\nSubstitute $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\xi/\\eta}$, so that $\\eta\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\eta\\xi}$:\n$$\nv(L) = \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} \\left(\\operatorname{sech}\\left(L\\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{\\eta}}\\right) - 1\\right) - \\frac{T_{a}}{\\sqrt{\\eta\\xi}} \\tanh\\left(L\\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{\\eta}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the lateral-edge velocity $v(L)$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe provided parameter values are:\n$L=3.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}$\n$\\eta=5.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1}$\n$\\xi=5.0\\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$T_{a}=5.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1}$\n$f_{m}=50\\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-2}$\n\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless argument of the hyperbolic functions, $\\lambda L$:\n$$\n\\lambda L = L\\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{\\eta}} = (3.0\\times 10^{-4}) \\sqrt{\\frac{5.0\\times 10^{9}}{5.0\\times 10^{-3}}} = (3.0\\times 10^{-4}) \\sqrt{10^{12}} = (3.0\\times 10^{-4})(10^{6}) = 300\n$$\nThe value of the argument, $300$, is large. For large $z$, the hyperbolic functions can be approximated as:\n$\\tanh(z) \\approx 1$\n$\\operatorname{sech}(z) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(z)} = \\frac{2}{\\exp(z) + \\exp(-z)} \\approx 2\\exp(-z) \\approx 0$\nWith $\\lambda L = 300$, these approximations are extremely accurate.\n$\\tanh(300) \\approx 1$\n$\\operatorname{sech}(300) \\approx 0$\nSubstituting these approximations into the expression for $v(L)$ yields a simplified form suitable for the given parameter regime:\n$$\nv(L) \\approx \\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} (0 - 1) - \\frac{T_{a}}{\\sqrt{\\eta\\xi}} (1) = -\\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} - \\frac{T_{a}}{\\sqrt{\\eta\\xi}}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical values of each term:\n$$\n\\frac{f_{m}}{\\xi} = \\frac{50}{5.0\\times 10^{9}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\eta\\xi} = \\sqrt{(5.0\\times 10^{-3})(5.0\\times 10^{9})} = \\sqrt{25\\times 10^{6}} = 5.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{T_{a}}{\\sqrt{\\eta\\xi}} = \\frac{5.0\\times 10^{-4}}{5.0\\times 10^{3}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe velocity is therefore:\n$$\nv(L) \\approx -1.0\\times 10^{-8} - 1.0\\times 10^{-7} = -0.1\\times 10^{-7} - 1.0\\times 10^{-7} = -1.1\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates medial convergence, which is consistent with the problem setup.
