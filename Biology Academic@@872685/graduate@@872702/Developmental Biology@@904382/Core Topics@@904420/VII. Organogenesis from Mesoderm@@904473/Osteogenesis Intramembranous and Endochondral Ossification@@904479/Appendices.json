This condition means that the maximum possible synthesis of Runx2, $\\alpha_R/\\delta_R$, must be greater than the repression threshold $K_{RS}$ for the osteogenic state to be achievable at any Wnt level. The value $W_c$ represents the minimum Wnt signal required to cross this threshold and enable the existence of the osteogenic state.
