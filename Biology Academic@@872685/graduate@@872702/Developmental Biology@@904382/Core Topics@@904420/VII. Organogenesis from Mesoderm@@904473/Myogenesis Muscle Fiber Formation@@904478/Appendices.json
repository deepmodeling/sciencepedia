The concept of the myonuclear domain is a central and well-established principle in muscle physiology and developmental biology. The use of a uniform partitioning assumption is a standard simplifying model used to establish first-order relationships. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and quantities ($V$, $N$, and their changes) to arrive at a unique, stable, and meaningful solution for the fold-change. The language is objective and precise. The problem is mathematically and biologically consistent, self-contained, and formalizable. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires us to formalize the relationship between total fiber volume, the number of myonuclei, and the myonuclear domain size. Let the myonuclear domain size, which is a volume, be denoted by $D$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition (ii), the total fiber volume $V$ is the sum of identically sized domains, with one domain contributed by each of the $N$ myonuclei. This can be expressed as a simple product: the total volume is equal to the number of nuclei multiplied by the volume of a single domain.\n$$V = N \\cdot D$$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for an expression for the myonuclear domain size $D$ in terms of $V$ and $N$. By algebraically rearranging the above equation, we find:\n$$D = \\frac{V}{N}$$\nThis is the expression for the myonuclear domain size at baseline.\n\nNext, we consider the state of the fiber after the hypertrophic episode. We will denote the new total volume, new number of myonuclei, and new myonuclear domain size with a prime symbol: $V'$, $N'$, and $D'$, respectively.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the new volume is double the original volume:\n$$V' = 2V$$\nThe new number of myonuclei is $1.3$ times the original number:\n$$N' = 1.3N$$\n\nThe same fundamental relationship between total volume, number of nuclei, and domain size holds true for the hypertrophied state, as the uniform partitioning assumption is to be maintained. Therefore:\n$$V' = N' \\cdot D'$$\n\nWe can now derive an expression for the new myonuclear domain size, $D'$, by substituting the expressions for $V'$ and $N'$ into this equation:\n$$D' = \\frac{V'}{N'} = \\frac{2V}{1.3N}$$\n\nThe final objective is to determine the fold-change in myonuclear domain size. The fold-change is the ratio of the new domain size ($D'$) to the original, baseline domain size ($D$).\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{D'}{D}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $D'$ and $D$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\frac{2V}{1.3N}}{\\frac{V}{N}}$$\n\nThis is a compound fraction that can be simplified. The variables $V$ and $N$ cancel out, which is expected as a fold-change is a dimensionless ratio.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{2V}{1.3N} \\cdot \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{2}{1.3}$$\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of this fraction.\n$$\\frac{2}{1.3} \\approx 1.538461538...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $5$, $3$, and $8$. The fifth significant digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate).\n$$\\text{Fold-change} \\approx 1.538$$\n\nThus, the myonuclear domain size has increased by a factor of approximately $1.538$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.538}$$", "id": "2656888"}, {"introduction": "The commitment of a myoblast to terminal differentiation is a critical decision orchestrated by master transcription factors like Myogenic Differentiation 1 (MyoD).

It presents a standard problem in biochemical kinetics using the Hill model for cooperative binding, a widely accepted framework for describing such phenomena in developmental biology and other fields. All data and conditions are provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. We will therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the concerted binding of $n$ molecules of the transcription factor MyoD, denoted as $M$, to a single promoter site, the E-box, denoted as $P$. This process can be represented by the chemical equilibrium:\n$$ n M + P \\rightleftharpoons M_n P $$\nwhere $M_n P$ is the complex of the promoter bound by $n$ MyoD molecules.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the effective dissociation constant for this concerted reaction, which we shall denote $K_{D,eff}$, is given by:\n$$ K_{D,eff} = \\frac{[M]^n [P]}{[M_n P]} $$\nHere, $[M]$ is the concentration of free MyoD, $[P]$ is the concentration of the free promoter, and $[M_n P]$ is the concentration of the occupied promoter.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total promoter sites that are bound by MyoD.

That is, when $[M] = K_d$, $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$. We use this definition to relate $K_{D,eff}$ to the provided parameter $K_d$. Substituting these values into the derived Hill equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K_d^n}{K_{D,eff} + K_d^n} $$\nSolving for $K_{D,eff}$:\n$$ K_{D,eff} + K_d^n = 2 K_d^n $$\n$$ K_{D,eff} = K_d^n $$\nNow we substitute this result back into our general Hill equation to obtain the expression in terms of the given parameters $[M]$, $n$, and $K_d$:\n$$ \\theta([M]) = \\frac{[M]^n}{K_d^n + [M]^n} $$\nThe problem states that the reporter output, which we can call $R$, is proportional to the promoter occupancy $\\theta$, and basal activity is negligible.
