Second, we introduce the two competing hypotheses for the A-B interfacial tension. Third, we enforce the condition that both hypotheses yield the same geometry to find the specific value of the work of adhesion, $W_{\\ast}$, that satisfies this equivalence.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the contact angle geometry from force balance.\n\nThe system consists of three interfaces meeting at a common contact line: the A-Medium interface with surface tension $ \\tau_{A} $, the B-Medium interface with surface tension $ \\tau_{B} $, and the A-B cell-cell interface with surface tension $ \\tau_{AB} $. At mechanical equilibrium, the vector sum of the tension forces acting on the contact line must be zero. Let the vectors representing these tensions be $ \\vec{\\tau}_{A} $, $ \\vec{\\tau}_{B} $, and $ \\vec{\\tau}_{AB} $. Each vector is tangent to its respective interface at the contact line. The condition for equilibrium is:\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B} + \\vec{\\tau}_{AB} = \\vec{0} $$\nThis implies that the three vectors form a closed triangle, known as the Neumann triangle. The magnitudes of the vectors are the surface tensions, so the side lengths of this triangle are $ \\tau_{A} $, $ \\tau_{B} $, and $ \\tau_{AB} $.\n\nThe angle $ \\beta $ is defined as the wedge angle of the medium between the free surfaces of cell A and cell B. This is the angle between the tangent to the A-Medium interface and the tangent to the B-Medium interface. In the force vector diagram, this corresponds to the angle between the vectors $ \\vec{\\tau}_{A} $ and $ \\vec{\\tau}_{B} $.\n\nWe can rearrange the vector sum as $ \\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B} = - \\vec{\\tau}_{AB} $. To relate the magnitudes and the angle $ \\beta $, we apply the Law of Cosines. The magnitude squared of the resultant vector $ \\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B} $ is:\n$$ |\\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B}|^2 = (\\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B}) \\cdot (\\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B}) = |\\vec{\\tau}_{A}|^2 + |\\vec{\\tau}_{B}|^2 + 2 \\vec{\\tau}_{A} \\cdot \\vec{\\tau}_{B} $$\nSubstituting the magnitudes and the definition of the dot product:\n$$ |\\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B}|^2 = \\tau_{A}^{2} + \\tau_{B}^{2} + 2 \\tau_{A} \\tau_{B} \\cos\\beta $$\nSince $ \\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B} = - \\vec{\\tau}_{AB} $, their magnitudes are equal: $ |\\vec{\\tau}_{A} + \\vec{\\tau}_{B}| = |-\\vec{\\tau}_{AB}| = \\tau_{AB} $.

This means that for the same set of cortical tensions $ \\tau_{A} $ and $ \\tau_{B} $, the predicted angle $ \\beta $ must be the same.\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{DAH}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{DITH}} $$\nThis implies that their cosines must be equal:\n$$ \\cos(\\beta_{\\mathrm{DAH}}) = \\cos(\\beta_{\\mathrm{DITH}}) $$\nUsing the expression for $ \\cos\\beta $ derived in Step 1, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{(\\tau_{AB}^{\\mathrm{DAH}})^{2} - \\tau_{A}^{2} - \\tau_{B}^{2}}{2 \\tau_{A} \\tau_{B}} = \\frac{(\\tau_{AB}^{\\mathrm{DITH}})^{2} - \\tau_{A}^{2} - \\tau_{B}^{2}}{2 \\tau_{A} \\tau_{B}} $$\nAssuming $ \\tau_{A} > 0 $ and $ \\tau_{B} > 0 $, the denominator is non-zero, so we can simplify by equating the numerators:\n$$ (\\tau_{AB}^{\\mathrm{DAH}})^{2} - \\tau_{A}^{2} - \\tau_{B}^{2} = (\\tau_{AB}^{\\mathrm{DITH}})^{2} - \\tau_{A}^{2} - \\tau_{B}^{2} $$\n$$ (\\tau_{AB}^{\\mathrm{DAH}})^{2} = (\\tau_{AB}^{\\mathrm{DITH}})^{2} $$\nSince surface tensions are physically non-negative quantities ($ \\tau_{AB} \\ge 0 $), we can take the positive square root of both sides, leading to the condition that the interfacial tensions themselves must be equal:\n$$ \\tau_{AB}^{\\mathrm{DAH}} = \\tau_{AB}^{\\mathrm{DITH}} $$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $ \\tau_{AB} $ from each hypothesis.

The Langmuir isotherm is a standard model for saturable binding. The vertex model, with its balance of cortical tension and cell-cell adhesion, is a cornerstone of computational developmental biology. The linear relationship for the coherence index is a simple, plausible phenomenological model. All components are scientifically sound for the purpose of a formal problem.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters and a set of explicit, non-contradictory formulas. The calculation for each test case leads to a unique, deterministic result.\n-   **Objective:** The language is formal and quantitative, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. All variables are defined, and their units are consistent, leading to a final energy/tension in piconewtons, as required. There are no contradictions.\n-   **Realism:** The parameter values are within physically plausible ranges for cellular biophysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\n\nThe task is to compute several biophysical quantities based on a provided vertex model framework. The solution requires a methodical application of the given formulas for each test case.\n\nThe fundamental relationship for the adhesion energy per unit length, $ W $, is derived by combining the concepts of fractional occupancy and energy contribution per bond. Given a surface density of E-cadherin $ \\rho $, the occupancy is $ \\theta(\\rho) = \\frac{\\rho}{K_d + \\rho} $. The adhesion energy per unit length is then given as $ W = \\varepsilon_b \\delta \\rho \\theta(\\rho) $. We can substitute the expression for $ \\theta(\\rho) $ to obtain a single equation for $ W $ as a function of $ \\rho $:\n$$\nW(\\rho) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_b \\delta \\rho^2}{K_d + \\rho}\n$$\nThis quantity, $ W $, represents the adhesion-mediated reduction in effective line tension, $ \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} $, which is defined as:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Lambda - W(\\rho)\n$$\nwhere $ \\Lambda $ is the cortical contractility. The tissue's collective migration coherence, represented by the index $ \\Phi $, is modeled as a function of this effective tension. For $ \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} > 0 $, the junction is under net tension, and coherence decreases linearly from a maximum of $ 1 $. If adhesion is strong enough to make $ \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\le 0 $, the junction is under net adhesion, and coherence is maximal ($ \\Phi=1 $). This is captured by the piecewise function:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\le 0 \\\\\n\\max\\!\\left(0,\\, 1 - \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right), & \\text{if } \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows, adhering strictly to the definitions:\n\n1.  **Define Densities:** Given the initial E-cadherin surface density, $ \\rho_0 $, the reduced density, $ \\rho_1 $, is calculated using the reduction factor $ r = 0.5 $:\n    $$\n    \\rho_1 = r \\cdot \\rho_0 = 0.5 \\cdot \\rho_0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Compute Adhesion Energies:** The baseline adhesion energy, $ W_0 $, and the reduced adhesion energy, $ W_1 $, are computed using the formula for $ W(\\rho) $ with densities $ \\rho_0 $ and $ \\rho_1 $, respectively:\n    $$\n    W_0 = \\frac{\\varepsilon_b \\delta \\rho_0^2}{K_d + \\rho_0}\n    $$\n    $$\n    W_1 = \\frac{\\varepsilon_b \\delta \\rho_1^2}{K_d + \\rho_1}\n    $$\n    The change in adhesion energy is their difference:\n    $$\n    \\Delta W = W_1 - W_0\n    $$\n\n3.  **Compute Effective Line Tensions:** The corresponding effective line tensions, $ \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},0} $ and $ \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},1} $, are calculated using the constant contractility $ \\Lambda $:\n    $$\n    \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},0} = \\Lambda - W_0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},1} = \\Lambda - W_1\n    $$\n\n4.  **Compute Coherence Indices:** The coherence indices, $ \\Phi_0 $ and $ \\Phi_1 $, are computed by applying the piecewise function $ \\Phi(\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}) $ to $ \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},0} $ and $ \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},1} $, respectively. The change in the coherence index is then:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\Phi = \\Phi_1 - \\Phi_0\n    $$\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for all provided test cases. The output for each case will be a list of six floating-point numbers: $ [W_0, W_1, \\Delta W, \\Phi_0, \\Phi_1, \\Delta \\Phi] $, with each value rounded to six decimal places. The final program will aggregate these results into a single list of lists.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes adhesion energies and coherence indices for epithelial tissue\n    based on a vertex model framework for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: (rho_0, K_d, delta, epsilon_b, Lambda, tau_th)\n        (1000.0, 800.0, 0.02, 2.25, 50.0, 30.0),\n        # Case B: (rho_0, K_d, delta, epsilon_b, Lambda, tau_th)\n        (10000.0, 500.0, 0.02, 2.25, 50.0, 30.0),\n        # Case C: (rho_0, K_d, delta, epsilon_b, Lambda, tau_th)\n        (100.0, 800.0, 0.02, 2.25, 5.0, 10.0),\n    ]\n\n    r = 0.5  # Reduction factor for E-cadherin density\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        rho_0, K_d, delta, epsilon_b, Lambda, tau_th = case\n\n        # Step 1: Compute adhesion energy W\n        def calculate_W(rho, K_d, delta, epsilon_b):\n            \"\"\"Computes adhesion energy per unit length (W).\"\"\"\n            # Fractional occupancy theta = rho / (K_d + rho)\n            # W = epsilon_b * delta * rho * theta\n            # W = epsilon_b * delta * rho^2 / (K_d + rho)\n            if K_d + rho == 0:\n                # Avoid division by zero, although not expected with given parameters\n                return 0.0\n            return (epsilon_b * delta * rho**2) / (K_d + rho)\n\n        # Step 2: Compute coherence index Phi\n        def calculate_Phi(tau_eff, tau_th):\n            \"\"\"Computes the coherence index (Phi).\"\"\"\n            if tau_eff = 0:\n                return 1.0\n            else:\n                phi = 1.0 - (tau_eff / tau_th)\n                return max(0.0, phi)\n\n        # Calculations for initial state (rho_0)\n        W_0 = calculate_W(rho_0, K_d, delta, epsilon_b)\n        tau_eff_0 = Lambda - W_0\n        Phi_0 = calculate_Phi(tau_eff_0, tau_th)\n\n        # Calculations for reduced density state (rho_1)\n        rho_1 = r * rho_0\n        W_1 = calculate_W(rho_1, K_d, delta, epsilon_b)\n        tau_eff_1 = Lambda - W_1\n        Phi_1 = calculate_Phi(tau_eff_1, tau_th)\n        \n        # Calculate changes\n        delta_W = W_1 - W_0\n        delta_Phi = Phi_1 - Phi_0\n\n        # Store results for the current case\n        case_results = [W_0, W_1, delta_W, Phi_0, Phi_1, delta_Phi]\n        all_results.append(case_results)\n\n    # Format the final output string as a JSON-like list of lists\n    # Each number must be formatted to six decimal places.\n    formatted_cases = []\n    for case_result in all_results:\n        formatted_nums = [f\"{num:.6f}\" for num in case_result]\n        formatted_cases.append(f\"[{','.join(formatted_nums)}]\")\n    \n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(formatted_cases)}]\"\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2623686"}]}
