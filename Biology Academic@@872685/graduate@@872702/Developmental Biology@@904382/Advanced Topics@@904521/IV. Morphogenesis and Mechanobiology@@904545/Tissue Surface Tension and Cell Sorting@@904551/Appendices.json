The CPM interaction energy (Hamiltonian) includes a contact term that penalizes unlike contacts and favors like contacts, with symmetric pair interaction energies $J_{AA}$, $J_{BB}$, and $J_{AB}$. Assume the following:\n\n- The aggregate is approximately spherical, incompressible, and isotropic at the tissue scale.\n- Both cell types share identical target volume and boundary constraints; contributions from volume and boundary constraints are the same between the two macrostates and can be neglected when comparing them.\n- Cell–medium interactions are equal for A and B or are otherwise constrained to be the same across the two macrostates, so that any cell–medium contributions cancel in the energy difference.\n- The relative abundances are fixed, with volume fractions $\\phi_{A}$ and $\\phi_{B} = 1 - \\phi_{A}$.\n- In the continuum limit, the aggregate radius is $R$, so that a core of volume fraction $\\phi$ has radius $R\\,\\phi^{1/3}$, and hence area $4\\pi R^{2}\\phi^{2/3}$.\n\nStarting from the CPM contact Hamiltonian and basic interfacial counting arguments, derive the energy difference $\\Delta H = H_{\\text{A core}} - H_{\\text{B core}}$ between the two macrostates in terms of $J_{AA}$, $J_{BB}$, $J_{AB}$, and $\\phi_{A}$, up to a common positive geometric prefactor that cancels when determining which macrostate has lower energy.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics as applied to developmental biology via the Cellular Potts Model (CPM). The assumptions provided are clear, internally consistent, and sufficient for the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is well-posed and objective. We shall now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental quantity is the CPM contact Hamiltonian, $H$, which assigns an energy to a configuration of cells on a lattice. It is a sum over all neighboring lattice sites of pair-wise interaction energies:\n$$H = \\sum_{\\langle \\vec{i}, \\vec{j} \\rangle} J_{\\sigma(\\vec{i})\\sigma(\\vec{j})}$$\nwhere $\\sigma(\\vec{i})$ is the identity (cell type A or B) of the cell occupying lattice site $\\vec{i}$, and the sum is over all unique pairs of adjacent lattice sites. The parameters $J_{XY}$ are the contact energies between cells of type X and Y.\n\nIn the continuum limit, for a large number of cells, this discrete sum can be approximated by a continuous energy functional dependent on the interfacial areas between different populations. The total energy $H$ of a configuration can be expressed as the sum of bulk energies and interfacial energies. As the volumes of the cell populations, $\\phi_A$ and $\\phi_B$, are fixed, the bulk energy terms are constant for all configurations and can be excluded when comparing the energies of different sorted macrostates. The change in energy is therefore dominated by the changes in the total interfacial energy. The energy of an interface is the product of its area, $A_{XY}$, and its corresponding interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{XY}$. Thus, the relevant part of the Hamiltonian is:\n$$H \\approx \\gamma_{AB}A_{AB} + \\gamma_{AM}A_{AM} + \\gamma_{BM}A_{BM}$$\nwhere $M$ denotes the surrounding medium.\n\nWe are asked to compare two macrostates:\n1.  **A core / B shell**: In this configuration, there is an interface between cell type A and cell type B, and an interface between cell type B and the medium. There is no A-medium interface, so $A_{AM} = 0$.\n    The volume of the A-core is $V_A = \\phi_A V_{total}$. For a spherical aggregate of radius $R$, the radius of the A-core is $r_A = R\\phi_A^{1/3}$.\n    The area of the A-B interface is the surface area of this core: $A_{AB}^{(1)} = 4\\pi r_A^2 = 4\\pi R^2 \\phi_A^{2/3}$.\n    The area of the B-medium interface is the surface area of the entire aggregate: $A_{BM}^{(1)} = 4\\pi R^2$.\n    The energy of this macrostate, $H_{\\text{A core}}$, is:\n    $$H_{\\text{A core}} = \\gamma_{AB} (4\\pi R^2 \\phi_A^{2/3}) + \\gamma_{BM} (4\\pi R^2)$$\n\n2.  **B core / A shell**: In this configuration, there is an interface between B and A, and an interface between A and the medium. There is no B-medium interface, $A_{BM} = 0$.\n    The volume of the B-core is $V_B = \\phi_B V_{total} = (1 - \\phi_A)V_{total}$. The radius of the B-core is $r_B = R\\phi_B^{1/3} = R(1 - \\phi_A)^{1/3}$.\n    The area of the B-A interface, with $\\gamma_{BA} = \\gamma_{AB}$, is: $A_{AB}^{(2)} = 4\\pi r_B^2 = 4\\pi R^2 (1 - \\phi_A)^{2/3}$.\n    The area of the A-medium interface is the surface area of the entire aggregate: $A_{AM}^{(2)} = 4\\pi R^2$.\n    The energy of this macrostate, $H_{\\text{B core}}$, is:\n    $$H_{\\text{B core}} = \\gamma_{AB} (4\\pi R^2 (1 - \\phi_A)^{2/3}) + \\gamma_{AM} (4\\pi R^2)$$\n\nWe are to calculate the energy difference $\\Delta H = H_{\\text{A core}} - H_{\\text{B core}}$:\n$$\\Delta H = \\left[ \\gamma_{AB} (4\\pi R^2 \\phi_A^{2/3}) + \\gamma_{BM} (4\\pi R^2) \\right] - \\left[ \\gamma_{AB} (4\\pi R^2 (1 - \\phi_A)^{2/3}) + \\gamma_{AM} (4\\pi R^2) \\right]$$\nThe problem states that \"cell–medium contributions cancel in the energy difference\". This is a precise constraint which implies that the total energy contribution from the cell-medium interface is identical in both macrostates. Given that the total external surface area is the same in both cases ($4\\pi R^2$), this simplifies to the condition $\\gamma_{BM} = \\gamma_{AM}$. Applying this condition, the terms involving the medium cancel out:\n$$\\Delta H = \\gamma_{AB} (4\\pi R^2 \\phi_A^{2/3}) - \\gamma_{AB} (4\\pi R^2 (1 - \\phi_A)^{2/3})$$\n$$\\Delta H = 4\\pi R^2 \\gamma_{AB} \\left( \\phi_A^{2/3} - (1 - \\phi_A)^{2/3} \\right)$$\nThe next step is to relate the phenomenological interfacial tension $\\gamma_{AB}$ to the microscopic contact energies $J_{XY}$. From \"interfacial counting arguments\" based on rearranging the Hamiltonian, the energy can be shown to depend on the number of non-like contacts, $N_{AB}$. The change in energy is proportional to the change in $N_{AB}$ with a coefficient related to the \"exchange energy\":\n$$H = N_{AB} \\left( J_{AB} - \\frac{J_{AA} + J_{BB}}{2} \\right) + \\text{constant bulk terms}$$\nSince $N_{AB}$ is proportional to the interfacial area $A_{AB}$ in the continuum limit, the interfacial tension $\\gamma_{AB}$ must be proportional to this exchange energy. Let $\\alpha$ be a positive constant of proportionality related to the lattice geometry. Then:\n$$\\gamma_{AB} = \\alpha \\left( J_{AB} - \\frac{1}{2}(J_{AA} + J_{BB}) \\right)$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\Delta H$:\n$$\\Delta H = 4\\pi R^2 \\alpha \\left( J_{AB} - \\frac{1}{2}(J_{AA} + J_{BB}) \\right) \\left( \\phi_A^{2/3} - (1 - \\phi_A)^{2/3} \\right)$$\nThe problem asks for the derivation \"up to a common positive geometric prefactor\". The term $4\\pi R^2 \\alpha$ is such a prefactor; it is positive and depends on the geometry of the system and the underlying lattice but not on the configuration choice (A-core vs. B-core). The sign of $\\Delta H$, which determines the thermodynamically favored state, is independent of this prefactor. Therefore, the essential expression for the energy difference, which encapsulates all the dependencies on the problem's variables, is the remaining part.\n\nThe criterion for which macrostate has lower energy is determined by the sign of $\\Delta H$:\n- If $\\Delta H  0$, then $H_{\\text{A core}}  H_{\\text{B core}}$, and the configuration with cell type A forming the core is energetically favorable.\n- If $\\Delta H  0$, then $H_{\\text{A core}}  H_{\\text{B core}}$, and the configuration with cell type B forming the core is energetically favorable.\n- If $\\Delta H = 0$, the two states are energetically degenerate. This occurs trivially if $\\phi_A = 0.5$.\n\nFinally, the role of the temperature-like parameter $T$ in the Metropolis algorithm must be addressed. The equilibrium state of a system is, by definition, the state of minimum free energy. In this athermal model, this corresponds to the state of minimum Hamiltonian energy, $H$. The identity of this lowest-energy macrostate is determined solely by the parameters $J_{XY}$ and $\\phi_A$, as shown above. The parameter $T$ does not appear in the expression for $\\Delta H$ and therefore does not alter which state is the global energy minimum. Instead, $T$ controls the kinetics of the sorting process. The simulation proceeds via elementary steps (e.g., a pixel copy attempt) which cause a local change in energy, $\\delta H_{step}$. A step is accepted with probability $p = \\min\\{1, \\exp(-\\delta H_{step}/T)\\}$.\n- If $T \\to 0$, only energy-decreasing steps ($\\delta H_{step} \\le 0$) are accepted. The system quickly falls into the nearest local energy minimum and can become trapped, leading to extremely slow or arrested sorting dynamics.\n- If $T \\to \\infty$, all steps are accepted regardless of energy change ($p \\to 1$). The system explores all configurations randomly, and no ordered structure emerges. This corresponds to high thermal agitation overcoming the adhesive forces.\n- For an optimal, intermediate $T  0$, the system is able to accept some energetically unfavorable steps, allowing it to escape local energy minima and explore the configuration space more effectively, while still maintaining a strong probabilistic bias towards the global minimum. Thus, $T$ modulates the rate at which the system approaches the equilibrium sorted state, but not the identity of that state itself.\n\nBased on the prompt, the final answer for $\\Delta H$ is the expression without the unknown positive prefactor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left( J_{AB} - \\frac{1}{2}(J_{AA} + J_{BB}) \\right) \\left( \\phi_{A}^{2/3} - (1 - \\phi_{A})^{2/3} \\right)}$$", "id": "2685775"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are only as good as their ability to predict measurable phenomena, and this practice transitions from theory to the laboratory by focusing on how we quantify the effective surface tension, $\\gamma$, of a whole cell aggregate.

The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing physical principles. At steady state, the aggregate behaves as an incompressible liquid drop. This implies two conditions: conservation of total volume, and mechanical equilibrium governed by Laplace's law at the curved interfaces.\n\nLet us begin with the pressure balance. We denote the pressure in the external medium as $P_{\\mathrm{out}}$, the pressure inside the pipette as $P_{\\mathrm{pip}}$, and the uniform pressure inside the aggregate as $P_{\\mathrm{agg}}$. The applied suction pressure is defined as $\\Delta P = P_{\\mathrm{out}} - P_{\\mathrm{pip}}$.\nThere are two curved interfaces. The first is the external portion of the aggregate, which is assumed to be a sphere of radius $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$. The pressure jump across this interface is given by Laplace's law:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{agg}} - P_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}$$\nThe second interface is the cap of the aspirated tongue inside the pipette. It is described as a \"smoothly rounded cap that is locally spherical and matches the pipette radius\". This implies it is a spherical cap with a radius of curvature equal to the pipette inner radius, $R_{p}$. The pressure jump across this cap is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{agg}} - P_{\\mathrm{pip}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_{p}}$$\nThis second equation assumes a zero contact angle between the aggregate and the pipette wall, resulting in a hemispherical cap.\nTo find an expression for the applied suction $\\Delta P$, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n$$(P_{\\mathrm{agg}} - P_{\\mathrm{pip}}) - (P_{\\mathrm{agg}} - P_{\\mathrm{out}}) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_{p}} - \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{out}} - P_{\\mathrm{pip}} = \\Delta P = 2\\gamma \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{p}} - \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right)$$\nThis is the required relationship between $\\Delta P$, $\\gamma$, $R_{p}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\nNext, we must relate $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$ to the aspirated length $L$ using the principle of volume conservation. The initial volume of the spherical aggregate is $V_{0} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{0}^{3}$.\nAfter aspiration, this volume is partitioned into the volume inside the pipette, $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and the volume of the external spherical part, $V_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3}$.\nThe volume inside the pipette, $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is composed of a right circular cylinder and a spherical cap. The problem states that the aspirated tongue has length $L$. For $L \\ge R_{p}$, the tongue consists of a cylindrical section of radius $R_{p}$ and length $L-R_{p}$, and a hemispherical cap of radius $R_{p}$. The volume is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{in}} = V_{\\mathrm{cylinder}} + V_{\\mathrm{cap}} = \\pi R_{p}^{2}(L - R_{p}) + \\frac{2}{3}\\pi R_{p}^{3}$$\nThis is valid for all data points provided, as $L_{1}=R_{p}$, $L_{2}R_{p}$, and $L_{3}R_{p}$.\nBy conservation of volume, $V_{0} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} + V_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{0}^{3} = \\left( \\pi R_{p}^{2}(L - R_{p}) + \\frac{2}{3}\\pi R_{p}^{3} \\right) + \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3}$$\nDividing by $\\pi$ and rearranging to solve for $R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3}$:\n$$\\frac{4}{3}R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3} = \\frac{4}{3}R_{0}^{3} - R_{p}^{2}(L-R_{p}) - \\frac{2}{3}R_{p}^{3}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3} = R_{0}^{3} - \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{2}(L-R_{p}) - \\frac{1}{2}R_{p}^{3}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3} = R_{0}^{3} - \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{2}L + \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{3} - \\frac{1}{2}R_{p}^{3} = R_{0}^{3} - \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{2}L + \\frac{1}{4}R_{p}^{3}$$\nThus, $R_{\\mathrm{out}}(L)$ is given by:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{out}}(L) = \\left( R_{0}^{3} - \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{2}L + \\frac{1}{4}R_{p}^{3} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nNow we proceed to calculate $\\gamma$ from the experimental data.

The pure liquid-drop model is then an oversimplification. A viscoelastic material resists deformation not only through surface tension but also through internal viscous dissipation and elastic stresses. The equilibrium pressure required for a given deformation would depend on the material's elastic modulus $E$. The Laplace equation would need to be augmented with an elastic term, fundamentally changing the relationship. The apparent surface tension calculated using the simple liquid model would likely be an overestimate of the true thermodynamic surface tension, as it would lump elastic contributions into the 'tension' term. Furthermore, the approach to steady state would be governed by a relaxation time $\\tau$, and the measurement would be valid only for observation times much longer than $\\tau$.\n\nIf the liquid-glass contact angle $\\theta_{c}$ at the inner pipette wall is not zero, the assumption of a hemispherical cap is incorrect. The radius of curvature of the cap, $R_{\\text{cap}}$, would be related to the pipette radius by $R_{p} = R_{\\text{cap}} \\cos(\\theta_{c})$. The pressure jump across the cap would become $2\\gamma / R_{\\text{cap}} = 2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta_{c}) / R_{p}$. The suction pressure equation would be modified to $\\Delta P = 2\\gamma (\\frac{\\cos(\\theta_{c})}{R_{p}} - \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{out}}})$. Since $\\cos(\\theta_{c})  1$ for $\\theta_{c}  0$, the term in parenthesis is smaller for a given geometry. To generate the same measured $\\Delta P$, the true value of $\\gamma$ must be larger than the one calculated assuming $\\theta_{c}=0$. Therefore, ignoring a non-zero contact angle leads to an underestimation of the surface tension. The volume of the cap would also be a spherical segment, not a hemisphere, which would slightly alter the volume conservation calculation for $R_{\\mathrm{out}}(L)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00}$$", "id": "2685772"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of both the theory and measurement of tissue tension, we can address a central question in developmental biology: what is the molecular origin of this tension?

Prediction: $v_{0}$ correlates with $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}$ but not with $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ at baseline; equalizing $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ does not change $v_{0}$ differences between junction classes nor $X\\mbox{-}Y$ segregation, whereas ROCK inhibition abolishes both $v_{0}$ differences and $X\\mbox{-}Y$ segregation.

Prediction: a strong positive $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0}/\\ell,I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$ that persists after ROCK inhibition but is eliminated by equalizing $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$.

The system seeks to minimize interfacial free energy.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is subjected to rigorous evaluation.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in fundamental concepts of developmental biology and biophysics. Cell sorting is a classical problem, and the DAH and DITH are the principal competing theories. The experimental methods described—laser ablation to measure tension, fluorescence microscopy to quantify protein levels, and specific molecular perturbations (ROCK inhibition, genetic modification of cadherin levels)—are standard, state-of-the-art techniques in the field. The biophysical assumption relating recoil velocity to tension, $v_{0,j}\\propto T_{j}$, is a common and accepted simplification for modeling the initial viscoelastic response of the cell cortex. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The task is to identify an experimental strategy and a predicted outcome that can distinguish between two well-defined scientific hypotheses. The structure is clear, and a unique answer based on the provided theoretical framework is expected.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information: the system, the hypotheses, the measurements, the perturbations, and the core theoretical assumptions required to link them. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and internally consistent. It poses a rigorous question about experimental design and interpretation in modern quantitative cell biology. I will therefore proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe core task is to distinguish between the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH) and the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH). We must first establish the specific, testable predictions of each hypothesis based on the provided experimental framework.\n\nThe provided assumption is that the initial recoil velocity $v_{0,j}$ is directly proportional to the junctional tension $T_j$. Thus, measuring $v_{0,j}$ is equivalent to measuring $T_j$ up to a constant factor.\n\n**1. Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH)**\nThe DAH, proposed by Steinberg, posits that tissue surface tension and cell sorting are driven by differences in the adhesive free energy between cells. The total free energy is minimized when the sum of bond energies is maximized. Junctional tension $T_j$ in this framework is inversely related to the work of adhesion $W_j$. A stronger adhesive interface (higher $W_j$) is more energetically favorable, corresponding to a *lower* interfacial tension.\n-   $T_j \\propto -W_j$.\n-   Since $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$ is a proxy for adhesion strength, we predict $T_j$ will be anti-correlated with $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$.\n-   Therefore, the key prediction for DAH is: $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0}, I^{\\mathrm{cad}})  0$.\n-   Sorting occurs if heterotypic adhesion is weaker than the average of homotypic adhesions. This implies $T_{XY}$ would be higher than $T_{XX}$ and $T_{YY}$ because of lower $X\\mbox{-}Y$ adhesion.\n-   A causal test for DAH would involve equalizing E-cadherin levels. If differential adhesion is the sole driver, this perturbation should abolish differential tension and, consequently, cell sorting.\n\n**2. Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH)**\nThe DITH is a more general model where junctional tension arises from two opposing contributions: active actomyosin contractility ($\\gamma_j$), which increases tension, and cell-cell adhesion ($w_j$), which decreases it. A simplified form is $T_j \\approx \\gamma_j - w_j$. DITH proposes that differential sorting is primarily driven by differences in cortical contractility ($\\gamma_j$) between junction types, rather than adhesion.\n-   In this case, tension $T_j$ is primarily determined by the contractility term $\\gamma_j$.\n-   Since $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}_{j}$ is a proxy for actomyosin contractility, we predict $T_j$ will be positively correlated with $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}_{j}$.\n-   Therefore, the key prediction for DITH is: $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0}, I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}})  0$.\n-   The role of adhesion is secondary. While adhesion levels might vary, they are not the primary determinant of *differential* tension.\n-   A causal test for DITH would involve inhibiting contractility. Using a ROCK inhibitor should decrease or abolish differential contractility, which in turn should eliminate differential tension and stop cell sorting. Conversely, manipulating adhesion levels (e.g., equalizing cadherin) should have little to no effect on differential tension or sorting.\n\nThe question asks for the strategy and outcome that would support DITH and falsify DAH. We are looking for an option that describes:\n1.  A strong positive correlation between tension ($v_0$) and contractility ($I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}$).\n2.  A weak or non-existent correlation between tension and adhesion ($I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$) once the effect of contractility is accounted for.\n3.  Abolition of differential tension and sorting upon inhibiting contractility (ROCKi).\n4.  Persistence of differential tension and sorting upon equalizing adhesion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Measure $v_{0,j}$ and $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$ across all junction classes, compute the correlation $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0},I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$, then equalize $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ between $X$ and $Y$ and reassess. Prediction: a strong negative $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0},I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$ at baseline that disappears when $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ is equalized; ROCK inhibition reduces $v_{0}$ uniformly without abolishing $X\\mbox{-}Y$ sorting. Conclusion: adhesion differences set $T$; DITH is not required.**\n\nThis option describes a scenario that is perfectly consistent with the DAH. A strong negative correlation between tension ($v_0$) and adhesion ($I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$) is the central prediction of DAH. The disappearance of this effect upon equalizing cadherin levels would be strong causal evidence for DAH. The described outcome falsifies DITH, rather than supporting it. Therefore, this option is incorrect as an answer to the posed question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Measure $v_{0,j}$, $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$, and $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}_{j}$, compute partial correlations $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0},I^{\\mathrm{cad}}\\mid I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}})$ and $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0},I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}\\mid I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$, then perform both perturbations. Prediction: $v_{0}$ correlates with $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}$ but not with $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ at baseline; equalizing $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ does not change $v_{0}$ differences between junction classes nor $X\\mbox{-}Y$ segregation, whereas ROCK inhibition abolishes both $v_{0}$ differences and $X\\mbox{-}Y$ segregation. Conclusion: cortical contractility sets $T$ independent of adhesion abundance; supports DITH over DAH.**\n\nThis option outlines a rigorous experimental and analytical plan. The use of partial correlation is critical; it allows one to disentangle the respective contributions of adhesion and contractility to tension. The predicted outcome aligns precisely with the DITH:\n-   `v_0` (tension) correlates with `I_pMLC` (contractility), but not with `I_cad` (adhesion) after controlling for the other variable. This points to contractility as the primary driver.\n-   The perturbation experiments provide causal evidence. Equalizing adhesion has no effect, falsifying its role as the primary driver. Inhibiting contractility abolishes differential tension and sorting, confirming its causal role.\nThis entire suite of results provides decisive evidence for DITH while falsifying DAH.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Measure $v_{0,j}$ and $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$ and normalize $v_{0}$ by junction length to obtain $v_{0}/\\ell$. Prediction: a strong positive $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0}/\\ell,I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$ that persists after ROCK inhibition but is eliminated by equalizing $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$. Conclusion: higher adhesion increases interfacial tension; supports DITH because adhesion strengthens contractile cables.**\n\nThis option is flawed in multiple respects.\n-   The normalization $v_0/\\ell$ is not justified by the provided biophysical model ($v_0 \\propto T$), where $T$ is the force.\n-   The core prediction is a positive correlation between tension and adhesion. While biologically possible under certain complex models where adhesion scaffolds the cytoskeleton, it contradicts the classical DAH and is not the primary tenet of DITH.\n-   The predicted outcome of the perturbation is contradictory. If the correlation \"persists after ROCK inhibition,\" it implies that differential contractility is *not* responsible for the differential tension, which directly falsifies the DITH. Yet, the conclusion claims to support DITH. This is logically inconsistent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Measure $v_{0,j}$, $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$, and $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}_{j}$ and fit a multiple regression $v_{0}=\\alpha+\\beta_{\\mathrm{cad}}I^{\\mathrm{cad}}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{pMLC}}I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}+\\epsilon$. Prediction: neither coefficient is significant at baseline, and neither ROCK inhibition nor cadherin equalization changes junction-class differences in $v_{0}$ or sorting. Conclusion: both DAH and DITH are consistent, so neither can be falsified.**\n\nThis option describes a null result. A failure to find any correlation or causal link means the experiment is inconclusive. It does not mean \"both DAH and DITH are consistent\". On the contrary, such a result would fail to support *either* hypothesis. The task is to find a strategy that *decisively discriminates* between the hypotheses, not one that fails to do so. Therefore, this option describes an unsuccessful experiment and is not the correct answer.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2685777"}]}
