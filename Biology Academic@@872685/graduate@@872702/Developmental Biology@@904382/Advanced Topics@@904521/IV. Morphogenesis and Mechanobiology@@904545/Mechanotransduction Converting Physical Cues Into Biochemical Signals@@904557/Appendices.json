The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem is divided into three tasks. We will address them in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the force-indentation relationship.\n\nThis is the classical Hertzian contact problem. The derivation relies on relating the indentation depth $\\delta$, contact radius $a$, and applied force $F$. For a spherical indenter of radius $R$ on an elastic half-space, these relationships are:\n1.  Geometric compatibility (for small indentations): $\\delta = a^2/R$.\n2.  Force-indentation relation from elasticity theory: $F = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\frac{a^3}{R}$.\n\nThe reduced modulus $E^*$ for a rigid indenter on an elastic sample is defined as:\n$$E^* = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}$$\nTo derive the final force-indentation law, we express the contact radius $a$ in terms of the indentation depth $\\delta$ from the first relation: $a = \\sqrt{R\\delta}$. Then we substitute this into the second relation:\n$$F = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\frac{(\\sqrt{R\\delta})^3}{R} = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\frac{R^{3/2}\\delta^{3/2}}{R} = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R} \\delta^{3/2}$$\nThis is the celebrated Hertz model equation. The functional dependence is $F \\propto \\delta^{3/2}$, and the proportionality constant is $\\frac{4}{3}E^*\\sqrt{R}$.\n\nTask 2: Linearization of data to extract $E$.\n\nThe derived relationship is $F = \\left(\\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R}\\right) \\delta^{3/2}$.\nThe problem states that a linear fit is performed on a plot of $F$ (as the dependent variable) versus $\\delta^{3/2}$ (as the independent variable). The equation is in the form $y = m x$, where $y = F$, $x = \\delta^{3/2}$, and the slope is $m = S$.\nBy comparing the forms, we identify the slope $S$ with the proportionality constant:\n$$S = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R}$$\nThe goal is to express Young's modulus $E$ in terms of $S$, $R$, and $\\nu$. We start by isolating the reduced modulus $E^*$:\n$$E^* = \\frac{3S}{4\\sqrt{R}}$$\nNext, we substitute the definition of the reduced modulus, $E^* = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}$:\n$$\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} = \\frac{3S}{4\\sqrt{R}}$$\nFinally, we solve for $E$:\n$$E = \\frac{3S(1-\\nu^2)}{4\\sqrt{R}}$$\nThis equation allows for the calculation of the sample's Young's modulus from the slope of the linearized force-indentation data.\n\nTask 3: Numerical calculation of $E$.\n\nThe provided experimental values are:\nIndenter radius, $R = 5.00 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nPoisson's ratio of the sample, $\\nu = 0.49$.\nSlope from linear fit, $S = 12.0 \\ \\mathrm{nN} \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-3/2}$.\n\nWe use the formula derived in Task $2$:\n$$E = \\frac{3S(1-\\nu^2)}{4\\sqrt{R}}$$\nIt is critical to maintain consistent units.

According to Transition State Theory in the high-friction limit, the rate of dissociation, $k_{\\text{off}}$, is given by an Arrhenius-like expression:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, or attempt frequency, which depends on the vibrational frequencies in the bound state and the shape of the barrier. $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the activation free energy, which is the difference in free energy between the transition state and the bound state minimum.\n\nAt zero applied force, $F=0$, the off-rate is denoted $k_0$. The activation free energy is $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)$. The expression for the rate is:\n$$\nk_0 = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that in the regime of interest, the pre-factor $A$ can be considered independent of the force $F$.\n\nWhen an external tensile force $F$ is applied, the free energy landscape is altered. The new, force-dependent free energy profile is given as $U_F(q) = U_0(q) - F q$. We must calculate the new activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)$. This is the energy difference between the transition state and the bound state in the presence of the force.\n\nThe energy of the bound state, located at $q=0$, is:\n$$\nU_F(0) = U_0(0) - F(0) = U_0(0)\n$$\nThe problem states that for small forces, the location of the transition state is not appreciably altered and remains at $q=x_b$. The energy of the transition state is therefore:\n$$\nU_F(x_b) = U_0(x_b) - F x_b\n$$\nThe force-dependent activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)$, is the difference between these two energy levels:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F) = U_F(x_b) - U_F(0) = (U_0(x_b) - F x_b) - U_0(0)\n$$\nBy rearranging the terms, we can separate the zero-force component from the force-dependent component:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F) = [U_0(x_b) - U_0(0)] - F x_b\n$$\nWe identify the term in the brackets as the activation free energy in the absence of force, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) = U_0(x_b) - U_0(0)$. Thus, the new activation energy is lowered by an amount equal to the work done by the force to move the system to the transition state:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F) = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) - F x_b\n$$\nNow, we can write the expression for the force-dependent off-rate, $k_{\\text{off}}(F)$, using this new activation energy:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}(F) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)}{k_B T}\\right) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) - F x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of the exponential function, we can split the expression into two factors:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}(F) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe first part of this expression, $A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_B T}\\right)$, is identical to the expression for the zero-force off-rate, $k_0$. Substituting $k_0$ into the equation yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}(F) = k_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Bell model expression for the force-dependent dissociation rate.\n\nJustification of the physical range of validity:\nThis expression rests on several key assumptions, which define its range of applicability in mechanotransduction contexts.\n1.  **Small Force and Rigid Landscape**: The derivation assumes that the force $F$ does not significantly alter the geometry of the reaction pathway, specifically the location of the transition state $x_b$ and the curvatures of the potential well and barrier (which define the pre-factor $A$). This approximation is valid when the mechanical work done on the bond, $F x_b$, is much smaller than the intrinsic activation energy barrier height, i.e., $F x_b \\ll \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)$. For typical biological bonds, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)$ is on the order of $10-25$ $k_B T$, and $x_b$ is on the order of angstroms to a few nanometers ($10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ m). This implies the model is valid for forces typically up to tens of piconewtons ($10^{-12}$ N), which is a relevant range for many cellular processes. At higher forces, the landscape itself deforms, and $x_b$ becomes a function of $F$.\n2.  **Overdamped Dynamics and Timescale Separation**: The use of TST in the high-friction (overdamped) regime assumes that inertial effects are negligible and that the system's motion is dominated by viscous drag from the cellular environment. This is an excellent assumption for macromolecules in aqueous solution at physiological temperatures, where the Reynolds number is very small. It also implicitly assumes a separation of timescales: the thermal equilibration of the molecule within the potential well must be much faster than the rate of escape over the barrier. This condition is generally met for barriers that are several $k_B T$ high, ensuring that the bond state is well-defined.\n3.  **One-Dimensional Reaction Coordinate**: The model simplifies a complex, multi-dimensional unbinding process into motion along a single coordinate $q$. This is a reasonable approximation if there exists a dominant, low-energy dissociation pathway and the applied force vector is aligned with this pathway. Its validity diminishes if unbinding can occur via multiple distinct pathways or if the force pulls the system in a direction orthogonal to the natural unbinding coordinate.\n4.  **Slip Bonds Only**: The model inherently describes what are known as \"slip bonds\", where the lifetime of the bond ($1/k_{\\text{off}}$) decreases monotonically with applied tensile force. This is because $x_b$ is defined as a positive constant. The model does not apply to \"catch bonds\", which are specialized bonds that strengthen (i.e., their off-rate decreases) over an intermediate range of forces. Catch bonds require more complex energy landscapes with multiple states and pathways that are differentially affected by force. The derived expression is therefore valid only for systems that do not exhibit catch-bond behavior.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B} T}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2651871"}, {"introduction": "To fully appreciate mechanotransduction, we must integrate molecular events into a coherent, system-level pathway that connects an external mechanical input to a functional cellular output.
