The assumptions, such as constant thickness and no cell proliferation, are standard simplifications used to model this phenomenon over specific timescales. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of information to derive a unique solution. The connection between mass conservation and area conservation is explicitly justified by the premises of constant density and constant thickness. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of mass. The problem states that the tissue can be modeled as a continuum with constant mass density $\\rho$ and constant thickness $h$.

Outside this core region, the contribution to the shear increment is zero. The problem also states that all events are oriented in the same direction, so their contributions to the shear add up constructively. The assumption of dilute events allows us to use linear superposition, meaning we can neglect the spatial overlap of the core regions of events occurring within the same time interval $dt$.\n\nLet the set of T1 events that occur in the tissue during the interval from $t$ to $t+dt$ be indexed by $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N$, where $N$ is the total number of events in area $A$.

Data Representation and Preprocessing**\n\nThe state of the cell sheet at discrete time points $t_k$ is represented by a symmetric binary adjacency matrix $A_k$ of size $N \\times N$, where $N$ is the number of cells. An entry $A_k(i, j) = 1$ signifies that cells $i$ and $j$ are neighbors at time $t_k$, and $A_k(i, j) = 0$ otherwise. By convention, the diagonal entries $A_k(i, i)$ are zero. These matrices are constructed from the provided sets of unordered pairs of neighboring cells (edges). For each time point $t_k$, an $N \\times N$ matrix is initialized with zeros. For each edge $(u, v)$ in the given set, the entries corresponding to that pair, $A_k(u, v)$ and $A_k(v, u)$, are set to $1$.\n\n**2. Quantification of Cell Rearrangement Rate**\n\nA neighbor exchange event, or T1 transition, manifests as a change in the adjacency relationships between cells. Over a time interval $[t_k, t_{k+1}]$, the number of such changes is quantified by comparing the adjacency matrices $A_k$ and $A_{k+1}$.\n\nThe number of toggled unordered cell pairs, $\\text{toggles}_k$, is the count of pairs $(i, j)$ with $i < j$ for which the adjacency status has changed. This is computed by taking the element-wise difference between the two matrices, $D_k = A_{k+1} - A_k$, and summing the absolute values of the entries in the upper triangle:\n$$\n\\text{toggles}_k = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{N-1} |A_{k+1}(i, j) - A_k(i, j)|\n$$\nEach completed neighbor exchange event is assumed to rewire two edges (i.e., cause two toggles in the upper triangle, one connection lost and one gained). Thus, the estimated number of events $E_k$ in the interval is:\n$$\nE_k = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{toggles}_k\n$$\nThe rate of neighbor exchanges per cell per minute, $r_k$, is then calculated by normalizing $E_k$ by the number of cells $N$ and the duration of the interval $\\Delta t_k$ (in seconds), and converting to a per-minute basis by multiplying by $60$:\n$$\nr_k = \\frac{E_k}{N} \\cdot \\frac{60}{\\Delta t_k}\n$$\n\n**3. Quantification of Tissue Strain Rate**\n\nThe tissue strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$, is defined in continuum mechanics as $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{1}{L(t)} \\frac{dL}{dt}$, where $L(t)$ is the tissue length. Over a discrete interval $[t_k, t_{k+1}]$, this can be approximated by integrating the definition, which yields the logarithmic strain rate (or true strain rate):\n$$\n\\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) dt = \\int_{L(t_k)}^{L(t_{k+1})} \\frac{dL}{L} = \\ln(L(t_{k+1})) - \\ln(L(t_k))\n$$\nAssuming a constant strain rate $s_k$ over the interval of duration $\\Delta t_k$, we get $s_k \\cdot \\Delta t_k = \\ln(L_{k+1}) - \\ln(L_k)$. We solve for $s_k$ and convert to units of per minute:\n$$\ns_k = \\left(\\frac{\\ln L_{k+1} - \\ln L_k}{\\Delta t_k}\\right) \\cdot 60\n$$\n\n**4. Statistical Analysis and Summary**\n\nAfter computing the time series $\\{r_k\\}_{k=0}^{T-1}$ and $\\{s_k\\}_{k=0}^{T-1}$ for $T$ intervals, two summary statistics are calculated for each test case.\n\nFirst, the mean neighbor exchange rate, $\\bar{r}$, is calculated as the arithmetic average of the rates over all intervals:\n$$\n\\bar{r} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=0}^{T-1} r_k\n$$\nSecond, the relationship between the two series is quantified using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). For two series $X = \\{x_i\\}$ and $Y = \\{y_i\\}$ of length $T$, the PCC is defined as:\n$$\n\\rho_{X,Y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the means of the respective series. If the variance of either series is zero (i.e., all elements are identical), the denominator becomes zero. As per the problem specification, the correlation coefficient is defined to be $0$ in such cases. Computationally, this will be handled using `numpy.corrcoef`, which correctly handles this scenario by producing `NaN` that can be mapped to $0$, or by explicitly checking for zero variance before the calculation.\n\nThe final implementation will process each test case from the provided suite, executing these steps to produce the required pair of values: $\\bar{r}$ and the PCC, rounded to six decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the convergent extension problem for the given test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test 1 (happy path, variable neighbor exchanges and positive strain)\n        {\n            \"N\": 4,\n            \"dt\": 60,\n            \"edges\": [\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)},\n            ],\n            \"lengths\": [100.0, 101.0, 101.5, 104.0],\n        },\n        # Test 2 (edge case with no rewiring and no strain)\n        {\n            \"N\": 4,\n            \"dt\": 60,\n            \"edges\": [\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)},\n            ],\n            \"lengths\": [120.0, 120.0, 120.0, 120.0],\n        },\n        # Test 3 (negative correlation scenario: high neighbor exchange when strain is negative)\n        {\n            \"N\": 4,\n            \"dt\": 60,\n            \"edges\": [\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)},\n            ],\n            \"lengths\": [150.0, 147.0, 147.0, 146.0],\n        },\n    ]\n\n    final_results = []\n\n    def build_adjacency_matrix(N, edges):\n        \"\"\"Constructs a symmetric binary adjacency matrix from an edge set.\"\"\"\n        adj_matrix = np.zeros((N, N), dtype=int)\n        for u, v in edges:\n            adj_matrix[u, v] = 1\n            adj_matrix[v, u] = 1\n        return adj_matrix\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[\"N\"]\n        dt = case[\"dt\"]\n        edge_sets = case[\"edges\"]\n        lengths = case[\"lengths\"]\n\n        num_time_points = len(edge_sets)\n        adj_matrices = [build_adjacency_matrix(N, edges) for edges in edge_sets]\n\n        rates_r = []\n        strains_s = []\n\n        for k in range(num_time_points - 1):\n            A_k = adj_matrices[k]\n            A_k_plus_1 = adj_matrices[k+1]\n\n            # 1.
