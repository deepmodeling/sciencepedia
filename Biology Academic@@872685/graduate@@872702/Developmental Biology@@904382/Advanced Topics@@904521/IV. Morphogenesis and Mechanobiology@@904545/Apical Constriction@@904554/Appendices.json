We shall proceed directly to the derivation and solution.\n\n### Task A: Derivation of the Coupled ODE System\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by fundamental principles of biochemical kinetics.\n\nThe rate of change of the active RhoA fraction, $R(t)$, is determined by the balance between activation and inactivation.\nThe activation process, driven by GEFs, converts inactive RhoA, with fraction $1 - R(t)$, to active RhoA at a rate proportional to this inactive pool. The rate of increase of $R(t)$ due to activation is thus $k_{\\text{on}}(1 - R(t))$.\nThe inactivation process, driven by GAPs, converts active RhoA back to its inactive state. This contributes to a decrease in $R(t)$ at a rate proportional to the active fraction, giving a term $-k_{\\text{off}}R(t)$.\nCombining these terms gives the ordinary differential equation for $R(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}(1 - R(t)) - k_{\\text{off}}R(t) $$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form of a linear first-order ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} + (k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}})R(t) = k_{\\text{on}} $$\n\nThe dimensionless myosin activation level, $M(t)$, is linearly driven by the active RhoA fraction, $R(t)$, with a gain of $k_m$. This corresponds to a production term $k_m R(t)$. Myosin activation also relaxes, or decays, with a rate constant $\\delta_m$, contributing a term $-\\delta_m M(t)$. The resulting ODE for $M(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = k_m R(t) - \\delta_m M(t) $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} + \\delta_m M(t) = k_m R(t) $$\n\nThe complete coupled ODE system, with specified initial conditions, is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}} - (k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}})R(t),  R(0) = R_0 \\\\\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_m R(t) - \\delta_m M(t),  M(0) = M_0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n### Task B: Analytical Solution\n\nThe system is a set of linear ODEs which can be solved sequentially.\n\n**Solution for $R(t)$:**\nThe equation for $R(t)$ is an uncoupled, first-order, linear, non-homogeneous ODE. Let $k_{\\text{tot}} = k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}}$. The equation is $\\frac{dR}{dt} + k_{\\text{tot}} R = k_{\\text{on}}$.\nThe integrating factor is $I(t) = e^{\\int k_{\\text{tot}} dt} = e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t}$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$ yields:\n$$ e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t} \\frac{dR}{dt} + k_{\\text{tot}} e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t} R(t) = k_{\\text{on}} e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t} $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(R(t) e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t}\\right) = k_{\\text{on}} e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t} $$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$, assuming $k_{\\text{tot}}  0$:\n$$ R(t) e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{tot}}} e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t} + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the constant of integration. Dividing by $e^{k_{\\text{tot}} t}$ gives the general solution:\n$$ R(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{tot}}} + C_1 e^{-k_{\\text{tot}} t} $$\nApplying the initial condition $R(0) = R_0$:\n$$ R_0 = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{tot}}} + C_1 \\implies C_1 = R_0 - \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{tot}}} $$\nThe steady-state value $R^*$ is found by taking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$. Assuming $k_{\\text{tot}}  0$ (which is true for all test cases as $k_{\\text{on}}, k_{\\text{off}}$ are non-negative and not simultaneously zero), the exponential term decays to zero:\n$$ R^* = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} R(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}}} $$\nThe particular solution for $R(t)$ is thus:\n$$ R(t) = R^* + (R_0 - R^*) e^{-k_{\\text{tot}} t} $$\n\n**Solution for $M(t)$:**\nSubstituting the solution for $R(t)$ into the equation for $M(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} + \\delta_m M(t) = k_m \\left[ R^* + (R_0 - R^*) e^{-k_{\\text{tot}} t} \\right] $$\nThis is another first-order linear ODE.

The integration becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(M(t) e^{\\delta_m t}\\right) = k_m R^* e^{\\delta_m t} + k_m (R_0 - R^*) $$\n$$ M(t) e^{\\delta_m t} = \\frac{k_m R^*}{\\delta_m} e^{\\delta_m t} + k_m (R_0 - R^*) t + C_3 $$\nGeneral solution:\n$$ M(t) = \\frac{k_m R^*}{\\delta_m} + k_m (R_0 - R^*) t e^{-\\delta_m t} + C_3 e^{-\\delta_m t} $$\nAs before, $M^* = \\frac{k_m R^*}{\\delta_m}$. Applying $M(0) = M_0$:\n$$ M_0 = M^* + 0 + C_3 \\implies C_3 = M_0 - M^* $$\nThe particular solution is:\n$$ M(t) = M^* + (M_0 - M^*) e^{-\\delta_m t} + k_m (R_0 - R^*) t e^{-\\delta_m t} $$\n\n**Steady States:**\nThe steady-state values $(R^*, M^*)$ are obtained by setting the time derivatives to zero, assuming the required rate constants ($k_{\\text{tot}}$ and $\\delta_m$) are positive.\n$$ 0 = k_{\\text{on}} - (k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}})R^* \\implies R^* = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}}} $$\n$$ 0 = k_m R^* - \\delta_m M^* \\implies M^* = \\frac{k_m}{\\delta_m} R^* = \\frac{k_m}{\\delta_m} \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}}} $$\nThese expressions are valid for all test cases provided.\n\n### Task C: Implementation\n\nThe analytical solutions derived are implemented in a program.

Treat the sheet as a thin plate with bending stiffness $B$ given by $B = \\dfrac{E h^3}{12 \\left(1 - \\nu^2\\right)}$. In the small-slope regime and prior to any geometric nonlinearities, the onset of buckling under in-plane compression can be analyzed by linear stability of the out-of-plane deflection $w(x)$.\n\nUsing fundamental linear elasticity and stability arguments (force balance or energy minimization) appropriate for a thin plate undergoing one-dimensional bending, derive the critical value of the uniform contractile surface tension $\\tau_c$ (equal to the compressive membrane force per unit length at buckling) required to buckle this clamped segment. Express your final answer as a single closed-form symbolic expression in terms of $E$, $h$, $\\nu$, and $L$. Express the critical contractile tension in Newtons per meter (N/m). No numerical evaluation is required; do not round.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a classical stability problem in continuum mechanics—specifically, the Euler buckling of a clamped-clamped elastic plate strip under uniform axial compression. The modeling of an epithelial sheet as an elastic plate and actomyosin tension as a compressive force are standard and valid simplifying assumptions in the field of biophysics and developmental biology. All necessary parameters and boundary conditions are provided, and no contradictions are present. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe system is a thin elastic plate of thickness $h$, Young's modulus $E$, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, experiencing a uniform contractile surface tension $\\tau$ which acts as a compressive force per unit length. The geometry is a long rectangular patch of length $L$ that is clamped at its ends, $x=0$ and $x=L$. Due to the large width, the problem reduces to one-dimensional bending, where the out-of-plane deflection $w$ is a function of $x$ only, i.e., $w(x)$.\n\nThe governing equation for the linear stability of a thin plate strip under an in-plane compressive force per unit width, $N_x$, is given by the balance of bending and compressive forces:\n$$\nB \\frac{d^4 w}{dx^4} + N_x \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nIn this problem, the bending stiffness per unit width for plane strain is given as $B = \\dfrac{E h^3}{12 (1 - \\nu^2)}$, and the compressive force per unit width $N_x$ is equal to the contractile tension $\\tau$. The governing equation for the deflection $w(x)$ is therefore:\n$$\nB \\frac{d^4 w}{dx^4} + \\tau \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nTo find the critical tension $\\tau_c$ at which the plate buckles, we seek the smallest non-zero value of $\\tau$ for which a non-trivial solution $w(x) \\neq 0$ exists that satisfies the boundary conditions.\n\nLet us define a parameter $k^2 = \\dfrac{\\tau}{B}$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^4 w}{dx^4} + k^2 \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a fourth-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The characteristic equation is $r^4 + k^2 r^2 = 0$, or $r^2(r^2 + k^2) = 0$. The roots are $r_1=r_2=0$, $r_3 = ik$, and $r_4 = -ik$. The general solution for $w(x)$ is:\n$$\nw(x) = C_1 \\sin(kx) + C_2 \\cos(kx) + C_3 x + C_4\n$$\nwhere $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$ are constants of integration. These constants are determined by the boundary conditions. The plate is clamped at both ends, $x=0$ and $x=L$. Clamped boundary conditions mean that both the deflection and the slope of the deflection are zero.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n$1$. At $x=0$, $w(0) = 0$.\n$2$. At $x=0$, $w'(0) = 0$.\n$3$. At $x=L$, $w(L) = 0$.\n$4$. At $x=L$, $w'(L) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the general solution:\n$$\nw'(x) = C_1 k \\cos(kx) - C_2 k \\sin(kx) + C_3\n$$\nApplying the conditions at $x=0$:\nFrom $w(0)=0$: $C_1 \\sin(0) + C_2 \\cos(0) + C_3(0) + C_4 = 0 \\implies C_2 + C_4 = 0 \\implies C_4 = -C_2$.\nFrom $w'(0)=0$: $C_1 k \\cos(0) - C_2 k \\sin(0) + C_3 = 0 \\implies C_1 k + C_3 = 0 \\implies C_3 = -C_1 k$.\n\nSubstituting $C_3$ and $C_4$ back into the solution and its derivative:\n$$\nw(x) = C_1 \\sin(kx) + C_2 \\cos(kx) - C_1 kx - C_2 = C_1(\\sin(kx) - kx) + C_2(\\cos(kx) - 1)\n$$\n$$\nw'(x) = C_1 k \\cos(kx) - C_2 k \\sin(kx) - C_1 k = C_1 k (\\cos(kx) - 1) - C_2 k \\sin(kx)\n$$\nNow, we apply the conditions at $x=L$:\nFrom $w(L)=0$:\n$$\nC_1(\\sin(kL) - kL) + C_2(\\cos(kL) - 1) = 0\n$$\nFrom $w'(L)=0$:\n$$\nC_1 k (\\cos(kL) - 1) - C_2 k \\sin(kL) = 0\n$$\nAssuming $k \\neq 0$ (since we are looking for a non-zero buckling load), we can divide the second equation by $k$:\n$$\nC_1(\\cos(kL) - 1) - C_2 \\sin(kL) = 0\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear homogeneous equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$. For a non-trivial solution (i.e., for buckling to occur, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin(kL) - kL  \\cos(kL) - 1 \\\\ \\cos(kL) - 1  -\\sin(kL) \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-(\\sin(kL) - kL)\\sin(kL) - (\\cos(kL) - 1)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\sin^2(kL) + kL\\sin(kL) - (\\cos^2(kL) - 2\\cos(kL) + 1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-(\\sin^2(kL) + \\cos^2(kL)) + kL\\sin(kL) + 2\\cos(kL) - 1 = 0\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$:\n$$\n-1 + kL\\sin(kL) + 2\\cos(kL) - 1 = 0\n$$\n$$\nkL\\sin(kL) + 2\\cos(kL) - 2 = 0\n$$\nThis is the transcendental characteristic equation for the buckling modes. We solve for the smallest positive value of $kL$ that satisfies this equation. Using half-angle identities $\\sin(z) = 2\\sin(z/2)\\cos(z/2)$ and $\\cos(z)=1-2\\sin^2(z/2)$, with $z=kL$:\n$$\n(kL)\\left(2\\sin\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right)\\right) + 2\\left(1 - 2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right)\\right) - 2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n2kL\\sin\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) - 4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\sin\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) \\left[ kL\\cos\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) - 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nThis equation provides two sets of possible solutions:\n$1$. $\\sin\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) = 0$. This implies $\\frac{kL}{2} = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. The smallest positive non-zero solution is for $n=1$, which gives $kL = 2\\pi$.\n$2$. $kL\\cos\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) - 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) = 0$. This can be written as $\\tan\\left(\\frac{kL}{2}\\right) = \\frac{kL}{2}$. Let $\\beta = \\frac{kL}{2}$. The equation is $\\tan(\\beta) = \\beta$. The smallest positive root of this equation is approximately $\\beta \\approx 4.4934$, which corresponds to $kL \\approx 8.9868$.\n\nThe critical buckling condition corresponds to the lowest possible energy state, which is achieved at the smallest value of the compressive load $\\tau$. Since $\\tau = B k^2 = B (kL)^2 / L^2$, the minimum $\\tau$ corresponds to the minimum positive value of $kL$. Comparing the two possible solutions, $2\\pi \\approx 6.2832$ and $8.9868$, the smallest value is $kL = 2\\pi$.\n\nThus, the critical condition for buckling is:\n$$\n(kL)_c = 2\\pi\n$$\nSubstituting $k_c^2 = \\tau_c/B$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_c}{B} L^2 = (2\\pi)^2 = 4\\pi^2\n$$\nSolving for the critical contractile tension $\\tau_c$:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{4\\pi^2 B}{L^2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the provided expression for the bending stiffness $B = \\dfrac{E h^3}{12 (1 - \\nu^2)}$:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} \\left( \\frac{E h^3}{12 (1 - \\nu^2)} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the numerical factors gives the final expression:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{\\pi^2 E h^3}{3 L^2 (1 - \\nu^2)}\n$$\nThis is the critical contractile surface tension required to induce buckling in the clamped epithelial sheet.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^2 E h^3}{3 L^2 (1 - \\nu^2)}}\n$$", "id": "2620202"}]}
