It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system involves two reversible binding reactions in equilibrium, which share a common reactant, the integrin receptor $R$.\nThe first reaction is the binding of the receptor $R$ to its natural ligand, fibronectin $L$:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nThe equilibrium for this reaction is described by the dissociation constant $K_d$, defined according to the Law of Mass Action:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free ligand, and receptor-ligand complex, respectively.\n\nThe second reaction is the competitive binding of the receptor $R$ to a soluble inhibitor $I$ (the RGD peptide):\n$$R + I \\rightleftharpoons RI$$\nThe equilibrium for this reaction is described by the inhibitory constant $K_i$, which is a dissociation constant for the receptor-inhibitor complex:\n$$K_i = \\frac{[R][I]}{[RI]}$$\nwhere $[I]$ and $[RI]$ are the concentrations of the free inhibitor and the receptor-inhibitor complex, respectively.\n\nThe total concentration of the receptor, $R_T$, is conserved. Assuming $1:1$ stoichiometry for all complexes, the total receptor concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the free receptor, the ligand-bound receptor, and the inhibitor-bound receptor:\n$$R_T = [R] + [RL] + [RI]$$\n\nThe objective is to find a relationship for the fractional occupancy $\\theta = [RL]/R_T$ in terms of the inhibitor concentration $[I]$. To achieve this, we must express each term in the mass balance equation for $R_T$ as a function of $[RL]$ and the known constants and concentrations.\n\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we can express the free receptor concentration $[R]$ in terms of $[RL]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}$$\n\nFrom the definition of $K_i$, we can express the receptor-inhibitor complex concentration $[RI]$:\n$$[RI] = \\frac{[R][I]}{K_i}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $[R]$ into the expression for $[RI]$:\n$$[RI] = \\left( \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} \\right) \\frac{[I]}{K_i} = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d [I]}{K_i [L]} \\right)$$\n\nWe now substitute the expressions for $[R]$ and $[RI]$ into the receptor conservation equation:\n$$R_T = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL] + [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d [I]}{K_i [L]} \\right)$$\nTo simplify, we factor out the term $[RL]$:\n$$R_T = [RL] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + \\frac{K_d [I]}{K_i [L]} \\right)$$\nThe fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is defined as $\\theta = [RL]/R_T$. Rearranging the above equation gives the inverse of $\\theta$:\n$$\\frac{R_T}{[RL]} = \\frac{1}{\\theta} = 1 + \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + \\frac{K_d [I]}{K_i [L]}$$\nThis can be rewritten to express $\\theta$ directly:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_d}{[L]} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ yields a more convenient form:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nThis equation provides the derived relationship between the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ and the inhibitor concentration $[I]$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to solve for $[I]$ given specific values for the other parameters. We must rearrange the derived relationship to isolate $[I]$.\nStarting from $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)}$:\n$$[L] + K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right) = \\frac{[L]}{\\theta}$$\n$$K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right) = \\frac{[L]}{\\theta} - [L] = [L] \\left( \\frac{1}{\\theta} - 1 \\right) = [L] \\left( \\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta} \\right)$$\n$$1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d} \\left( \\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{[I]}{K_i} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d} \\left( \\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta} \\right) - 1$$\nFinally, we obtain the expression for $[I]$:\n$$[I] = K_i \\left[ \\frac{[L]}{K_d} \\left( \\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta} \\right) - 1 \\right]$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this equation:\n$[L] = 50\\ \\text{nM}$\n$K_d = 10\\ \\text{nM}$\n$K_i = 200\\ \\text{nM}$\n$\\theta = 0.20$\n\nThe dimensionless ratio of ligand concentration to its dissociation constant is:\n$$\\frac{[L]}{K_d} = \\frac{50\\ \\text{nM}}{10\\ \\text{nM}} = 5$$\nThe dimensionless ratio related to occupancy is:\n$$\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta} = \\frac{1 - 0.20}{0.20} = \\frac{0.80}{0.20} = 4$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $[I]$:\n$$[I] = 200\\ \\text{nM} \\left[ (5)(4) - 1 \\right]$$\n$$[I] = 200\\ \\text{nM} \\left[ 20 - 1 \\right]$$\n$$[I] = 200\\ \\text{nM} \\times 19$$\n$$[I] = 3800\\ \\text{nM}$$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
