## Introduction
Organoids—three-dimensional tissues grown in a dish from stem cells—have emerged as a transformative technology in biology and medicine. By recapitulating key aspects of organ development and function, they provide an unprecedented window into human [organogenesis](@entry_id:145155), a process that has long been inaccessible to direct experimental study. These complex models bridge the critical gap between simplified two-dimensional cell cultures and whole-organism studies, offering a more physiologically relevant platform to investigate human health and disease. This article addresses the fundamental question of how these intricate structures form and how they can be harnessed for scientific discovery.

This article will guide you through the multifaceted world of [organoid](@entry_id:163459) biology. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will delve into the core concept of stem cell-driven [self-organization](@entry_id:186805), exploring the signaling pathways and physical forces that orchestrate [tissue architecture](@entry_id:146183). The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will showcase how these principles are applied to model development, unravel disease [pathophysiology](@entry_id:162871), and advance translational medicine. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will offer an opportunity to engage with the quantitative aspects of [organoid](@entry_id:163459) biology through guided problem-solving. We begin by exploring the foundational principles that allow a small cluster of stem cells to build an organ.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Core Principles of Organoid Self-Organization

Organoid biology is founded upon the principle of **[self-organization](@entry_id:186805)**: the intrinsic capacity of stem cells to undergo differentiation and [morphogenesis](@entry_id:154405) in a three-dimensional environment to form structures that recapitulate aspects of their in vivo counterparts. This process is not a random aggregation of cells but a carefully orchestrated developmental program, driven by the same [gene regulatory networks](@entry_id:150976) and [cell-cell communication](@entry_id:185547) that shape organs in an embryo. Understanding these mechanisms allows us to both interpret the complex behaviors of organoid systems and rationally engineer them for specific scientific purposes.

#### What is an Organoid? The Principle of Stem Cell-Driven Self-Organization

While the term "organoid" is sometimes used broadly, in a rigorous developmental context it refers to a specific class of three-dimensional ($3\text{D}$) multicellular structures. A defining feature is that they are derived from either **pluripotent stem cells** (PSCs), such as embryonic or [induced pluripotent stem cells](@entry_id:264991), or from tissue-resident **[adult stem cells](@entry_id:142438)** or progenitors. These founding cells possess the potency to generate multiple lineages characteristic of a given organ. Crucially, an organoid undergoes **[self-organization](@entry_id:186805)** and **morphogenesis** to create an organotypic architecture and achieve some degree of realistic function. This process is driven by the intrinsic developmental programs encoded within the cells' genomes, which unfold in a permissive extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold supplemented with a minimal set of soluble cues. The system relies on cell-autonomous gene regulation and emergent cell-cell signaling to break symmetry and establish pattern, rather than on external geometric templating or [microfabrication](@entry_id:192662) to impose a shape [@problem_id:2622467].

This definition distinguishes organoids from other $3\text{D}$ culture systems. **Spheroids**, for example, are simpler cellular aggregates, often formed from cancer cell lines or a single differentiated cell type. While they are three-dimensional, they typically lack the stable developmental axes, diverse lineage hierarchies, and complex [morphogenesis](@entry_id:154405) seen in [organoids](@entry_id:153002). **Organ-on-chip** systems, on the other hand, are microphysiological platforms that often employ microfluidics to impose specific geometries, fluid flows, and mechanical stimuli on cells. They are powerful tools for studying physiological function, but they generally rely on pre-specified cell types assembled through engineering, rather than the stem cell-driven recapitulation of [organogenesis](@entry_id:145155) that defines organoids [@problem_id:2622467].

In essence, an organoid is an in vitro model of in vivo [organogenesis](@entry_id:145155), capturing its key features: **lineage diversification** (the generation of multiple cell types), **[tissue morphogenesis](@entry_id:270100)** (the spatial arrangement of these cells into recognizable structures like layers or lumens), and **functional maturation** (the acquisition of measurable, organ-specific functions, such as barrier transport in an intestinal [organoid](@entry_id:163459) or synchronized firing in a brain [organoid](@entry_id:163459)).

#### The Pluripotent State: Competency and Developmental Potential

The success of any [organoid](@entry_id:163459) protocol beginning from PSCs depends critically on the starting state of the cells. Pluripotent stem cells can exist in distinct states that reflect different stages of early embryonic development, most notably the **naive** and **primed** states. The naive state mirrors the pre-implantation epiblast, representing a "ground state" of [pluripotency](@entry_id:139300) with minimal lineage bias. These cells are typically maintained in culture by inhibiting differentiation pathways, such as the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)/Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) pathway, and are characterized by a unique epigenetic landscape with globally reduced DNA methylation. In contrast, the primed state resembles the post-implantation epiblast, a stage poised for [gastrulation](@entry_id:145188) and lineage specification. These cells are dependent on FGF and Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β)/Activin signaling for their maintenance and have a distinct epigenetic signature, with key developmental gene [enhancers](@entry_id:140199) held in a "bivalent" or poised state, ready for activation [@problem_id:2622559].

This distinction has profound practical consequences for organoid formation. A cell's ability to respond to a differentiation signal—its **competency**—depends on its expression of appropriate receptors and the accessibility of its downstream genetic programs. Primed cells, having been maintained in FGF and Activin, are already competent and can respond robustly and immediately to standard protocols for inducing [germ layers](@entry_id:147032), such as dual SMAD inhibition for [neuroectoderm](@entry_id:195622) or high Activin/WNT for [definitive endoderm](@entry_id:200451). Naive cells, however, must first transition to a state of competency. Because they are maintained with suppressed FGF/ERK signaling, they must be guided through a transitional, or **formative**, state by brief exposure to FGF and Activin. This "primes" them for differentiation by upregulating the necessary signaling machinery and remodeling chromatin to make lineage-specific enhancers accessible. This requirement for a transitional step is a crucial consideration when standardizing protocols across cell lines maintained in different pluripotent states [@problem_id:2622559].

#### Symmetry Breaking: The Engine of Pattern Formation

A fundamental challenge in development is **symmetry breaking**: the process by which a seemingly uniform and symmetric system, such as an early embryo or an initial [organoid](@entry_id:163459) aggregate, generates asymmetry and pattern. This transition from a state of higher symmetry to one of lower symmetry is the first step in establishing body axes and organizing tissues. Symmetry breaking in [organoids](@entry_id:153002) can occur through two primary modes: spontaneous and instructed [@problem_id:2622577].

**Spontaneous [symmetry breaking](@entry_id:143062)** occurs when the system's environment is isotropic (uniform in all directions), but its intrinsic dynamics amplify minute, random fluctuations (noise) to establish a stable, patterned state. The choice of the pattern's orientation (e.g., the exact location of a developing bud) is stochastic. A classic example in [organoid](@entry_id:163459) culture is the formation of a central **[lumen](@entry_id:173725)** in an epithelial cyst grown in a uniform matrix. Driven by the establishment of apico-basal polarity and directed ion transport, cells collectively create a fluid-filled cavity, breaking the initial [spherical symmetry](@entry_id:272852) of the solid aggregate. Because the environment lacks any directional cue, the internal polarity of each cell aligns with its neighbors but the overall orientation is random with respect to the lab frame [@problem_id:2622577].

**Instructed [symmetry breaking](@entry_id:143062)**, by contrast, occurs when an external anisotropy or pre-existing cue in the environment dictates the orientation of the resulting pattern. A powerful experimental demonstration of this is the application of a defined [morphogen gradient](@entry_id:156409) across an [organoid](@entry_id:163459) using a microfluidic device. For example, if a stable gradient of a WNT ligand is imposed, the boundary between developing tissue domains will reproducibly align itself relative to the [gradient vector](@entry_id:141180). Reversing the gradient's direction predictably reverses the pattern's orientation. This demonstrates that the external signal is instructing the axis of [symmetry breaking](@entry_id:143062), removing the [stochasticity](@entry_id:202258) observed in [spontaneous processes](@entry_id:137544) [@problem_id:2622577].

#### Mechanisms of Spontaneous Patterning: Reaction-Diffusion and Self-Assembly

How can a symmetric environment give rise to a stable, non-uniform pattern? A powerful explanatory framework was first proposed by Alan Turing, who showed that a system of interacting and diffusing chemical substances—a **reaction-diffusion** system—can spontaneously form patterns. The canonical Turing mechanism involves a short-range **activator** that positively regulates its own production and that of a long-range **inhibitor**. For a pattern to emerge from a near-homogeneous state, two conditions are crucial: (1) the inhibitor must diffuse significantly faster than the activator, and (2) the system must be stable to uniform perturbations but unstable to spatial perturbations of a specific wavelength.

This principle directly applies to [organoid self-organization](@entry_id:197175). Consider an aggregate of cells where each cell produces a secreted activator molecule ($u$) and a secreted inhibitor molecule ($v$). The activator promotes its own synthesis via a [positive feedback loop](@entry_id:139630) within the cell's [gene regulatory network](@entry_id:152540) (GRN), while also stimulating production of the inhibitor. If the inhibitor diffuses much more rapidly through the tissue than the activator ($D_v \gg D_u$), any small, random peak in activator concentration will be reinforced locally but suppressed at a distance. This "local activation, [long-range inhibition](@entry_id:200556)" dynamic amplifies initial fluctuations into stable peaks and troughs of morphogen concentration, establishing a chemical pre-pattern [@problem_id:2622587].

The physical parameters of the system determine the feasibility and scale of such patterns. For instance, with realistic diffusion coefficients for a small protein activator ($D_u \approx 1\,\mu\text{m}^2/\text{s}$) and a more mobile inhibitor ($D_v \approx 100\,\mu\text{m}^2/\text{s}$), and a typical decay rate ($\mu \approx 10^{-3}\,\text{s}^{-1}$), we can estimate the characteristic [diffusion length](@entry_id:172761) scales as $L \sim \sqrt{D/\mu}$. This yields a short activation range ($L_u \approx 32\,\mu\text{m}$) and a long inhibition range ($L_v \approx 316\,\mu\text{m}$). The emergent pattern will have a characteristic wavelength ($\lambda^*$) on the order of a few hundred microns, a scale that fits within a typical [organoid](@entry_id:163459) ($R \approx 400\,\mu\text{m}$). This allows for the spontaneous division of the [organoid](@entry_id:163459) into distinct fate domains without any external instruction [@problem_id:2622587].

This chemical pattern is then interpreted by cells, which differentiate accordingly and engage in physical [self-assembly](@entry_id:143388). Differences in cell identity lead to [differential expression](@entry_id:748396) of adhesion molecules like **cadherins**, resulting in variations in cell surface tension. Cells then sort themselves to minimize the [interfacial energy](@entry_id:198323) of the system, a process that can drive tissue segregation, layering, and lumen formation. Finally, [juxtacrine signaling](@entry_id:154394) mechanisms like **Notch–Delta** signaling act at the boundaries between these sorted domains to refine fate decisions at the single-cell level, creating sharp and stable borders. Thus, [organogenesis](@entry_id:145155) emerges from an integrated system of chemical signaling (reaction-diffusion), genetic programs (GRNs), and physical mechanics ([differential adhesion](@entry_id:276481)) [@problem_id:2622587].

### Engineering Organogenesis: Applying Developmental Logic in a Dish

The principles of self-organization can be harnessed to guide [organoid](@entry_id:163459) development toward specific outcomes. By providing key morphogens at defined times and concentrations, researchers can mimic the signaling centers of the embryo and instruct [organoids](@entry_id:153002) to adopt specific regional identities.

#### Patterning the Neural Axes: Combinatorial Morphogen Logic in Brain Organoids

The vertebrate nervous system is patterned along two primary axes: the **anterior-posterior (A-P)** axis (rostral-to-caudal) and the **dorsal-ventral (D-V)** axis (roof plate-to-floor plate). In the embryo, these axes are established by orthogonal gradients of signaling molecules. This logic can be recapitulated in brain [organoid](@entry_id:163459) cultures to generate specific brain regions [@problem_id:2622533].

The A-P axis is largely governed by WNT, FGF, and [retinoic acid](@entry_id:275773) signals originating from posterior sources. High levels of WNT and FGF signaling "posteriorize" neural tissue, inducing hindbrain and spinal cord fates. Conversely, the default state for neural tissue in the absence of these signals, or in the presence of their inhibitors, is anterior, leading to forebrain (telencephalic) identity.

The D-V axis is patterned by opposing gradients of BMPs from the dorsal midline (roof plate) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) from the ventral midline (floor plate). High BMP signaling specifies dorsal fates (e.g., cortical plate), while high SHH signaling specifies ventral fates (e.g., ganglionic eminences, floor plate).

By combining these signals, one can program regional identity. For example:
*   **Dorsal Forebrain (Cortex):** Achieved by inhibiting WNT and BMP pathways early in differentiation (a strategy known as dual SMAD inhibition), which promotes an anterior-dorsal fate [@problem_id:2622533].
*   **Ventral Forebrain:** An anteriorized [organoid](@entry_id:163459) (low WNT/FGF) can be "ventralized" by the addition of SHH, promoting the generation of interneuron progenitors.
*   **Ventral Midbrain:** A more posterior identity can first be induced with moderate WNT and FGF, followed by ventralization with SHH, a strategy used to generate dopaminergic neurons [@problem_id:2622533].

This combinatorial and context-dependent action of morphogens is a cornerstone of developmental engineering, allowing for the [directed differentiation](@entry_id:204773) of organoids into a diverse array of specific brain regions.

#### Recapitulating Corticogenesis: Lamination and Lineage in Brain Organoids

Dorsal forebrain organoids provide a remarkable model of human [cortical development](@entry_id:166660). They can recapitulate the complex **lineage hierarchy** and **inside-out lamination** characteristic of the neocortex. In this process, [neural stem cells](@entry_id:172194) called **apical radial glia (aRGs)** reside in a [ventricular zone](@entry_id:169365) (VZ)-like structure. These primary progenitors, marked by transcription factors *PAX6* and *SOX2*, divide to self-renew and to produce either neurons directly or, more commonly, other progenitor types [@problem_id:2622597].

These secondary progenitors include **intermediate progenitors (IPs)**, marked by *TBR2* (EOMES), which populate a [subventricular zone](@entry_id:189890) (SVZ) and divide to amplify the number of neurons produced. In primate development, aRGs also generate **outer radial glia (oRGs)**, marked by *HOPX*, which are crucial for the massive expansion of the cortex.

The neurons generated from this hierarchy assemble the cortical plate in a characteristic "inside-out" sequence. Neurons born earliest migrate a short distance to form the deep layers (layers V and VI). Subsequently born neurons migrate past these established cells to settle in progressively more superficial layers (layers IV, III, and II). This intricate migration is guided in part by signals like **Reelin (RELN)**, secreted from Cajal-Retzius cells in the outermost marginal zone [@problem_id:2622597].

Pulse-chase birthdating experiments in [organoids](@entry_id:153002) beautifully confirm this sequence. Cells labeled with a thymidine analog at an early time point (e.g., day 40) are later found in deep positions, expressing markers of deep-layer neurons like *TBR1* (layer VI) and *CTIP2* (layer V). Cells labeled at a later time (e.g., day 60) are found in superficial positions, expressing upper-layer markers like *SATB2* and *CUX1* (layers II-IV). The ability of [brain organoids](@entry_id:202810) to recapitulate this complex choreography of cell birth, migration, and layering makes them an invaluable model for studying human [cortical development](@entry_id:166660) and disease [@problem_id:2622597].

#### Patterning the Gut Axis: The Crypt-Villus Unit in Intestinal Organoids

Intestinal [organoids](@entry_id:153002), derived from either PSCs or adult [intestinal stem cells](@entry_id:268270), self-organize to form structures that mimic the functional unit of the intestinal epithelium: the **crypt-villus axis**. This axis is also patterned by opposing [morphogen gradients](@entry_id:154137). High **WNT** signaling is the defining feature of the crypt base, the niche that maintains the [intestinal stem cells](@entry_id:268270). Conversely, high **BMP** signaling is found at the villus tip, where it drives terminal differentiation [@problem_id:2622428].

In engineered systems, imposing a high WNT/low BMP environment at one pole ($x \approx 0$) and a low WNT/high BMP environment at the other ($x \approx 1$) robustly orients the crypt-villus axis. This allows for clear identification of the different cellular compartments based on their position and [molecular markers](@entry_id:172354):
*   **Crypt Base ($x \approx 0$):** This region contains the rapidly cycling [intestinal stem cells](@entry_id:268270), marked by *LGR5* and its target gene *OLFM4*. Interspersed among the stem cells are **Paneth cells**, supportive niche cells that express [antimicrobial peptides](@entry_id:189946) like *Lysozyme (LYZ)*.
*   **Transit-Amplifying (TA) Zone (e.g., $x \in [0.1, 0.3]$):** Adjacent to the crypt base is a zone of highly proliferative progenitors, marked by *MKI67*. These TA cells have downregulated LGR5 and are committed to differentiation.
*   **Villus ($x \approx 1$):** As cells migrate away from the crypt and toward the high-BMP region, they differentiate into the mature cell types of the villus. These include absorptive **[enterocytes](@entry_id:149717)**, marked by *Alkaline Phosphatase (ALPI)* and *Villin 1 (VIL1)*, and secretory **goblet cells**, which produce *Mucin 2 (MUC2)* [@problem_id:2622428].

The balance between absorptive and secretory fates is further refined by **Notch signaling**, which mediates [lateral inhibition](@entry_id:154817) among progenitor cells to ensure the correct proportions of each cell type are generated.

#### Dissecting the Niche: The Intestinal Stem Cell Environment

Organoids provide an ideal system for dissecting the precise molecular components of a [stem cell niche](@entry_id:153620). The standard culture medium for [intestinal organoids](@entry_id:189834), first formulated by the laboratory of Hans Clevers, contains a cocktail of factors that mimic the in vivo niche signals. Analysis of their individual and combined effects reveals their distinct mechanistic roles [@problem_id:2622439]:

*   **WNT:** WNT ligands (e.g., Wnt3a) provide the essential **instructive** signal for stemness. By binding to Frizzled/LRP receptors, they initiate the canonical pathway leading to the stabilization of $\beta$-catenin and the activation of stem cell target genes like *Axin2* and *Lgr5*. In the absence of a WNT ligand, the stem cell program is not initiated.
*   **R-spondin:** This factor is a critical **potentiator** of WNT signaling. R-spondin itself does not activate the pathway. Instead, it binds to LGR5 on stem cells and to the membrane-bound E3 [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) ligases RNF43 and ZNRF3. These ligases normally act as a negative feedback mechanism by targeting Frizzled receptors for degradation. By neutralizing RNF43/ZNRF3, R-spondin stabilizes WNT receptors on the cell surface, dramatically amplifying the cell's sensitivity to low levels of WNT ligand.
*   **EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor):** EGF provides a general **mitogenic** or proliferative signal by activating the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway. It is essential for driving the cell division of both stem cells and transit-amplifying progenitors, but it cannot substitute for WNT in maintaining stem cell identity.
*   **Noggin:** This factor is a BMP **antagonist**. It binds directly to BMP ligands, preventing them from engaging their receptors and activating the pro-differentiative SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway. By actively inhibiting this differentiation signal, Noggin helps to maintain cells in an undifferentiated, stem-like state.

Together, these four factors create a synthetic niche that supports robust [self-renewal](@entry_id:156504) and expansion of [intestinal stem cells](@entry_id:268270) in vitro, demonstrating the power of organoids as a reductionist tool for [developmental biology](@entry_id:141862) [@problem_id:2622439].

### Practical Considerations and Limitations

While [organoids](@entry_id:153002) are powerful models, their complexity presents challenges related to reproducibility and physiological fidelity. Acknowledging and addressing these issues is critical for rigorous research.

#### The Challenge of Variability: Experimental Design and Reproducibility

Organoid cultures are subject to significant variability, which can confound experimental results if not properly controlled. Key sources of variability include [@problem_id:2622437]:
*   **Donor Genetics:** iPSC lines derived from different individuals carry distinct genetic backgrounds, which can profoundly influence differentiation propensities and cellular phenotypes.
*   **iPSC Passage Number:** As iPSCs are cultured over time, they can accumulate epigenetic changes and [chromosomal abnormalities](@entry_id:145491) (e.g., copy-number variants) that alter their developmental potential. This is often correlated with passage number.
*   **Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Variability:** Commercially available basement membrane extracts (e.g., Matrigel) are biologically derived and exhibit significant lot-to-lot differences in protein composition and [growth factor](@entry_id:634572) concentration, which can impact [organoid](@entry_id:163459) development.
*   **Handling and Culture Conditions:** Subtle variations in technician handling, seeding density, culture media, and physical culture parameters (e.g., orbital shaker speed) can lead to differences in [organoid](@entry_id:163459) size, nutrient access, and developmental outcomes.

To obtain robust and generalizable results, a rigorous [experimental design](@entry_id:142447) is paramount. Best practices include:
1.  **Replication and Generalization:** Using multiple, genetically distinct donor lines ($n \ge 3$) is essential to ensure that an observed effect is not specific to one genetic background. For studying specific genetic variants, isogenic pairs (where a mutation is introduced into a control line via CRISPR) are the gold standard.
2.  **Control of Confounders:** Passage number should be carefully tracked and matched between experimental and control groups. Critical quality control, such as [karyotyping](@entry_id:266411), should be performed regularly.
3.  **Randomization and Blocking:** To manage [batch effects](@entry_id:265859) from ECM lots or technicians, randomization is key. In a **randomized block design**, samples from all experimental conditions are distributed across different ECM lots or handled by different technicians. This allows the variance associated with the batch to be statistically isolated from the [treatment effect](@entry_id:636010). Assigning one condition to one batch and another condition to a different batch creates a fatal [confounding variable](@entry_id:261683).
4.  **Standardization:** Wherever possible, protocols should be standardized, including cell seeding densities and physical culture parameters, to minimize technical noise [@problem_id:2622437].

By implementing these principles of experimental design and using appropriate statistical models (such as linear mixed-effects models that account for variance from donors and batches), the impact of variability can be managed, leading to more reproducible and reliable scientific conclusions.

#### Physical and Metabolic Constraints: The Hypoxic Core Problem

As organoids grow, they face a fundamental physical limitation common to all avascular tissues: the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients. Cells in the [organoid](@entry_id:163459)'s interior are dependent on molecules diffusing from the surrounding medium. This can lead to the formation of a **hypoxic core** when the organoid exceeds a critical size [@problem_id:2622488].

We can model this using a steady-state reaction-diffusion analysis for oxygen in a spherical organoid of radius $R$. Assuming a constant oxygen consumption rate ($q$) by the tissue and a diffusion coefficient ($D$), the oxygen concentration inside the [organoid](@entry_id:163459), $C(r)$, drops quadratically from the surface ($r=R$) to the center ($r=0$). The concentration at the center is given by:
$$ C(0) = C_s - \frac{q R^2}{6D} $$
where $C_s$ is the oxygen concentration at the surface. A hypoxic core forms when $C(0)$ falls below a critical threshold. The critical radius ($R^*$) at which this occurs scales as $R^* \propto \sqrt{D/q}$. This means larger organoids are more susceptible to hypoxia, as are those with higher oxygen consumption rates or lower tissue diffusivity [@problem_id:2622488].

This has direct implications for organoid biology. For example, during neuronal maturation, cells often shift from a more **glycolytic** metabolism to more efficient but oxygen-hungry **[oxidative phosphorylation](@entry_id:140461)**. This increases the tissue's overall oxygen consumption rate ($q$), which in turn *decreases* the [critical radius](@entry_id:142431) and makes the formation of a necrotic core more likely at a given size. Conversely, conditions that promote glycolysis can help larger organoids remain viable. Furthermore, this analysis highlights why different [organoid](@entry_id:163459) architectures have different limitations. A solid brain [organoid](@entry_id:163459) is limited by its full radius $R$, whereas a hollow intestinal [organoid](@entry_id:163459) is only limited by the diffusion distance across its thin epithelial wall ($h$). This allows [intestinal organoids](@entry_id:189834) to reach large overall diameters while avoiding hypoxia in the cellular layer [@problem_id:2622488].

The simple model of constant consumption can be refined using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, where the consumption rate decreases as the local oxygen concentration falls. This creates a [negative feedback](@entry_id:138619) that lessens the oxygen sink near the core, slightly increasing the maximum viable size compared to the zero-order model. Nonetheless, the fundamental [diffusion limit](@entry_id:168181) remains a major challenge in [organoid technology](@entry_id:181726), motivating the development of vascularized or perfused organoid systems to better mimic in vivo physiology [@problem_id:2622488].
