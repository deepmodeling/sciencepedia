The biological context is Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs), reprogrammed by the exogenous expression of Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), SRY-box 2 (SOX2), Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and cellular MYC (c-Myc), collectively referred to as OSKM. The fundamental bases to use are: (i) the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA to RNA to protein) establishing that transcription factors regulate each other’s expression by binding to regulatory elements; (ii) the widely accepted notion that cell fates correspond to attractors in gene regulatory networks; and (iii) the well-tested approximation that, at the timescale of cell state transitions, gene activity may be coarse-grained as Boolean variables, with synchronous update dynamics representing regulatory logic. To ensure scientific realism, use only monotone (activating) interactions consistent with OSKM’s roles: OCT4 and SOX2 form a core positive circuit, KLF4 supports core maintenance and is induced by the OCT4–SOX2 complex, and c-Myc primarily amplifies and is sustained by pluripotency activity.\n\nAdopt the following explicit network formalization derived from these bases. Let the endogenous state at discrete time $t$ be a vector $(O_t,S_t,K_t,M_t)\\in\\{0,1\\}^4$, corresponding to OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-Myc, respectively.

Cell fates are identified with attractors (fixed points in this context).\n- **State Representation**: The endogenous state of the four genes at discrete time $t$ is a Boolean vector $x_t = (O_t, S_t, K_t, M_t) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$.\n- **Input Representation**: Exogenous gene expression is represented by a Boolean vector $E = (E_O, E_S, E_K, E_M) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$.\n- **Update Logic**: The synchronous update function $F_E: \\{0, 1\\}^4 \\to \\{0, 1\\}^4$ is defined by the following coordinate functions:\n  $$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  O_{t+1} &= E_O \\lor \\left(S_t \\land (K_t \\lor O_t)\\right) \\\\\n  S_{t+1} &= E_S \\lor \\left(O_t \\land (K_t \\lor S_t)\\right) \\\\\n  K_{t+1} &= E_K \\lor \\left(O_t \\land S_t\\right) \\\\\n  M_{t+1} &= E_M \\lor \\left(O_t \\lor S_t \\lor K_t\\right)\n  \\end{aligned}\n  $$\n- **Attractor Definition**: A state $x$ is a fixed-point attractor if it satisfies the condition $F_E(x) = x$.\n- **State Encoding**: A state $x = (O, S, K, M)$ is mapped to an integer code $c(x) = 8O + 4S + 2K + M$.\n- **Task**: For a given test suite of $10$ different exogenous input vectors $E$, find all fixed points $x$ for each $E$. The output for each case must be the sorted list of the integer codes $c(x)$ of these fixed points.\n- **Test Suite**: A list of $10$ tuples for $(E_O, E_S, E_K, E_M)$: $(0,0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, $(0,0,0,1)$, $(1,1,0,0)$, $(1,0,1,0)$, $(0,1,1,0)$, $(1,1,1,0)$, $(1,1,1,1)$.\n\n### Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles in developmental and systems biology. The use of Boolean networks to model gene regulation is a standard, albeit simplified, approach in the field. The specific interactions encoded in the Boolean functions—such as the mutual activation of the OCT4-SOX2 core, their induction of KLF4, and the general amplification role of c-Myc—are consistent with experimental literature on pluripotency maintenance and induction. The problem is therefore scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically unambiguous. The state space is finite, containing $2^4 = 16$ states. The update rules are deterministic functions. A fixed point is clearly defined. For any given input vector $E$, the set of fixed points is unique and can be found by exhaustive search. Thus, the problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is articulated using precise, formal mathematical language (Boolean algebra). It is free from subjectivity, ambiguity, and non-scientific claims. It is objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined computational task grounded in an accepted scientific modeling paradigm. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to identify all states $x = (O, S, K, M)$ that are fixed points of the update map $F_E$ for a given exogenous input $E = (E_O, E_S, E_K, E_M)$. A state $x$ is a fixed point if and only if it is a solution to the system of simultaneous Boolean equations:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nO &= E_O \\lor \\left(S \\land (K \\lor O)\\right) \\\\\nS &= E_S \\lor \\left(O \\land (K \\lor S)\\right) \\\\\nK &= E_K \\lor \\left(O \\land S\\right) \\\\\nM &= E_M \\lor \\left(O \\lor S \\lor K\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe state space of the system is the set $\\{0, 1\\}^4$, which contains only $2^4 = 16$ distinct states. Given this small, finite number of states, the most direct and reliable method to find all fixed points is an exhaustive search. This method guarantees that all solutions are found without any possibility of error, provided the logic is implemented correctly.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each of the $10$ specified exogenous input vectors $E$, we perform an independent search for fixed points.\n2. The search iterates through every possible state $x = (O, S, K, M)$ in the state space. We can represent these $16$ states by an integer $i$ from $0$ to $15$. The individual gene activities $(O, S, K, M)$ can be recovered from the binary representation of $i$. Specifically, for an integer code $i$, the state is given by $O = (i \\gg 3) \\land 1$, $S = (i \\gg 2) \\land 1$, $K = (i \\gg 1) \\land 1$, and $M = i \\land 1$.\n3. For each state $x_t = (O, S, K, M)$, we compute the next state $x_{t+1} = (O', S', K', M')$ using the provided update equations.\n4. We then check if the state is a fixed point by comparing the current state with the next state. That is, we test if $x_t = x_{t+1}$, which is equivalent to checking if $O = O'$, $S = S'$, $K = K'$, and $M = M'$. Alternatively, one can compute the integer code of the next state, $c(x_{t+1})$, and check if it equals the integer code of the current state, $c(x_t) = i$.\n5. If a state is identified as a fixed point, its integer code $i$ is recorded.\n6. After iterating through all $16$ states for a given $E$, the collected list of fixed-point codes is sorted in ascending order as required. The iteration from $i=0$ to $15$ naturally produces sorted results, but adhering to the sorting step ensures correctness.\n7. This process is repeated for all $10$ test cases, and the final results are compiled into the specified output format.\n\nThis systematic procedure guarantees the complete and correct enumeration of all fixed-point attractors for the given model under each specified condition.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Boolean gene regulatory network problem by finding all fixed points\n    for a series of exogenous input conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0, 0, 0, 0),  # Case 1\n        (1, 0, 0, 0),  # Case 2\n        (0, 1, 0, 0),  # Case 3\n        (0, 0, 1, 0),  # Case 4\n        (0, 0, 0, 1),  # Case 5\n        (1, 1, 0, 0),  # Case 6\n        (1, 0, 1, 0),  # Case 7\n        (0, 1, 1, 0),  # Case 8\n        (1, 1, 1, 0),  # Case 9\n        (1, 1, 1, 1),  # Case 10\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    # There are 2^4 = 16 possible states for the vector (O, S, K, M).\n    num_states = 16\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        E_O, E_S, E_K, E_M = case\n        fixed_point_codes = []\n\n        # Iterate through every possible state, encoded as an integer from 0 to 15.\n        for i in range(num_states):\n            # Decode the integer 'i' into the Boolean state vector (O, S, K, M).\n            # O is the most significant bit, M is the least significant.\n            O = (i >> 3) & 1\n            S = (i >> 2) & 1\n            K = (i >> 1) & 1\n            M = (i >> 0) & 1\n\n            # Apply the synchronous Boolean update rules to find the next state.\n            # Python's 'or' and 'and' operators work correctly for 0/1 integers.\n            O_next = E_O or (S and (K or O))\n            S_next = E_S or (O and (K or S))\n            K_next = E_K or (O and S)\n            M_next = E_M or (O or S or K)\n\n            # Encode the next state vector into its integer code.\n            next_state_code = (O_next << 3) | (S_next << 2) | (K_next << 1) | M_next\n\n            # A state is a fixed point if it maps to itself.\n            if i == next_state_code:\n                fixed_point_codes.append(i)\n\n        # The problem requires sorting, although iterating from 0 to 15\n        # naturally produces a sorted list.\n        fixed_point_codes.sort()\n        \n        # Format the result for this case as a string, e.g., \"[0,15]\"\n        case_result_str = f\"[{','.join(map(str, fixed_point_codes))}]\"\n        all_results.append(case_result_str)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # e.g., \"[[0,15],[9,15],...]\"\n    print(f\"[{','.join(all_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2644841"}, {"introduction": "While Boolean networks describe the discrete logic of gene interactions, a more global perspective can be gained by envisioning cell fates as valleys in a \"Waddington landscape.\" This problem abstracts the complex gene network into a continuous potential energy function, $U(x)$, where stable cell states correspond to energy minima.

It is a valid problem of mathematical biology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe stationary points of the potential $U(x)$ are the locations where the force, $F = -dU/dx$, is zero. These are the critical points of the potential, found by solving $dU/dx = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dx} = 4\\alpha x^{3} - 2\\beta x - \\gamma = 0\n$$\nThis is a depressed cubic equation in $x$. For the potential to have two minima (attracting fixed points) and one maximum (repelling fixed point), this cubic equation must have three distinct real roots. Let us denote the function $f(x) = 4\\alpha x^{3} - 2\\beta x$. The roots of our equation are the intersections of the curve $y=f(x)$ with the horizontal line $y=\\gamma$. The function $f(x)$ has local extrema where $f'(x) = 12\\alpha x^{2} - 2\\beta = 0$, which occurs at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{2\\beta / (12\\alpha)} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta / (6\\alpha)}$.\nThe values of $f(x)$ at these extrema are:\n$$\nf\\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{6\\alpha}}\\right) = 4\\alpha \\left(\\pm\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{6\\alpha}\\right)^{3/2}\\right) - 2\\beta \\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{6\\alpha}}\\right) = \\pm\\left( \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta^{3/2}}{6\\sqrt{6}\\alpha^{3/2}} - \\frac{2\\beta^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{6\\alpha}} \\right) = \\pm\\left( \\frac{2\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}} - \\frac{2\\beta^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{6\\alpha}} \\right) = \\mp \\frac{4\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}}\n$$\nFor three distinct real roots to exist, $\\gamma$ must lie strictly between these two extremal values:\n$$\n-\\frac{4\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}} < \\gamma < \\frac{4\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\gamma^2 < \\left(\\frac{4\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}}\\right)^2$, which simplifies to:\n$$\n\\gamma^2 < \\frac{16\\beta^3}{9 \\cdot 6\\alpha} = \\frac{16\\beta^3}{54\\alpha} = \\frac{8\\beta^3}{27\\alpha}\n$$\nThus, the condition for the existence of a two-basin regime is $27\\alpha\\gamma^2 < 8\\beta^3$.\n\nNext, we must find the condition under which the two minima are of equal depth. Let the three roots of $dU/dx = 0$ be $x_p$, $x_b$, and $x_n$, corresponding to the primed minimum, the barrier maximum, and the naive minimum, respectively. The condition for equal potential energy at the minima is $U(x_p) = U(x_n)$.\nThe potential $U(x)$ can be decomposed into an even part, $U_{even}(x) = \\alpha x^4 - \\beta x^2$, and an odd part, $U_{odd}(x) = -\\gamma x$. The even part is symmetric about $x=0$ and, for $\\beta > 0$, possesses two minima of equal depth. The odd part, a linear tilt, raises the potential for $x<0$ and lowers it for $x>0$ (if $\\gamma>0$), or vice versa (if $\\gamma<0$). For the total potential $U(x)$ to have minima of equal depth, this symmetry-breaking tilt must be absent. This occurs precisely when $\\gamma=0$.\n\nWe can prove this formally. If $\\gamma = 0$, the potential becomes $U(x) = \\alpha x^4 - \\beta x^2$. The minima are found from $4\\alpha x^3 - 2\\beta x = 2x(2\\alpha x^2 - \\beta) = 0$.

The potential at these minima is:\n$$\nU(x_{p,n}) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha}\\right)^2 - \\beta \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha} - \\frac{\\beta^2}{2\\alpha} = -\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha}\n$$\nThe depths are equal. Conversely, if the depths are equal, any non-zero $\\gamma$ would break the symmetry of the potential landscape, making one well deeper than the other. The only way for the two wells to have identical energy is for the potential to be perfectly symmetric, which requires $\\gamma=0$.

The energetic barrier height $\\Delta U = U(x_{S})-U(x_{L})$ corresponds to a molecular bottleneck: larger $\\Delta U$ implies a rarer, more bottlenecked transition at fixed $D$.\n\nTest suite (each case is $(h,D)$):\n- Case 1: $(h,D) = (\\,0.2,\\,0.05\\,)$\n- Case 2: $(h,D) = (\\,0.0,\\,0.05\\,)$\n- Case 3: $(h,D) = (\\,0.35,\\,0.05\\,)$\n- Case 4: $(h,D) = (\\,0.2,\\,0.10\\,)$\n\nOutput specification:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing a comma-separated list of the four $S^{\\star}$ values, in the order of the test suite cases above, each rounded to exactly six decimal places, enclosed in square brackets.

The application to a Waddington-like landscape for cellular reprogramming is a standard and scientifically valid approach in theoretical biology. The model is a simplification, but it is not based on false premises or pseudoscience.\n- **Well-Posed**: The potential $U(x)$ is a double-well potential perturbed by a linear term $h x$. For sufficiently small $|h|$, the potential is guaranteed to have two minima and one maximum. The critical points are the roots of the cubic equation $U'(x) = x^3 - x + h = 0$. The discriminant of this cubic is $\\Delta = 4 - 27h^2$. For three distinct real roots, $\\Delta > 0$, implying $|h| < \\sqrt{4/27} \\approx 0.3849$. All provided values of $h$ ($0.0$, $0.2$, $0.35$) satisfy this condition. The calculation of the minimal action for a one-dimensional transition is a standard, well-defined problem with a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical terms, devoid of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nFor a one-dimensional gradient system driven by small noise, the most probable transition path, or instanton, that minimizes the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional involves the system moving from the initial minimum $x_{L}$ to the separating saddle point $x_S$. The optimal path satisfies the equation of motion $\\dot{x}(t) = -f(x(t))$ as it travels from $x_L$ to $x_S$. Substituting this into the action functional yields:\n$$S^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{4D}\\int\\left(\\dot{x}-f(x)\\right)^{2}\\,dt = \\frac{1}{4D}\\int\\left(-f(x)-f(x)\\right)^{2}\\,dt = \\frac{1}{D}\\int f(x)^2 dt$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we change the variable of integration from time $t$ to the state variable $x$. Using $dt = dx / \\dot{x} = dx / (-f(x))$, we get:\n$$S^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{D}\\int_{x_L}^{x_S} f(x)^2 \\left(\\frac{dx}{-f(x)}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{D} \\int_{x_L}^{x_S} f(x) dx$$\nSince the drift is the negative gradient of the potential, $f(x) = -U'(x)$, the action becomes:\n$$S^{\\star} = -\\frac{1}{D} \\int_{x_L}^{x_S} (-U'(x)) dx = \\frac{1}{D} \\int_{x_L}^{x_S} U'(x) dx = \\frac{1}{D} [U(x)]_{x_L}^{x_S}$$\nThus, the formula for the minimal action is the potential energy barrier for the transition, scaled by the noise intensity $D$:\n$$S^{\\star} = \\frac{U(x_S) - U(x_L)}{D}$$\nThis is the potential energy barrier for the transition, scaled by the noise intensity $D$. The procedure is as follows:\n1.  For a given $h$, find the three real roots of the cubic polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - x + h = 0$. These are the critical points.\n2.  Sort the roots in ascending order: $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$.\n3.  Identify the nature of the critical points using the second derivative test, $U''(x) = 3x^2 - 1$.\n    -   For $x_1$ (near $-1$), $U''(x_1) > 0$, so $x_1$ is a minimum. This is $x_L$.\n    -   For $x_2$ (near $0$), $U''(x_2) < 0$, so $x_2$ is a maximum. This is $x_S$.\n    -   For $x_3$ (near $+1$), $U''(x_3) > 0$, so $x_3$ is a minimum. This is $x_R$.\n4.  Calculate the potential difference $\\Delta U = U(x_S) - U(x_L)$ using the function $U(x) = \\frac{1}{4}(x^2-1)^2 + hx$.\n5.  Compute the action $S^{\\star} = \\Delta U / D$.\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each test case.\n\n**Case 1: $(h,D) = (0.2, 0.05)$**\n1.  Solve $x^3 - x + 0.2 = 0$. The roots are approximately $x_1 \\approx -1.094535$, $x_2 \\approx 0.202324$, $x_3 \\approx 0.892211$.\n2.  We identify $x_L = x_1 \\approx -1.094535$ and $x_S = x_2 \\approx 0.202324$.\n3.  Calculate potentials:\n    $U(x_L) = \\frac{1}{4}((-1.094535)^2 - 1)^2 + 0.2(-1.094535) \\approx -0.209141$\n    $U(x_S) = \\frac{1}{4}((0.202324)^2 - 1)^2 + 0.2(0.202324) \\approx 0.270428$\n4.  Compute action:\n    $\\Delta U = U(x_S) - U(x_L) \\approx 0.270428 - (-0.209141) = 0.479569$\n    $S^{\\star} = \\frac{0.479569}{0.05} = 9.59138$\n\n**Case 2: $(h,D) = (0.0, 0.05)$**\n1.  Solve $x^3 - x = x(x-1)(x+1) = 0$. The roots are exactly $x_1 = -1$, $x_2 = 0$, $x_3 = 1$.\n2.  We identify $x_L = -1$ and $x_S = 0$.\n3.  Calculate potentials:\n    $U(x_L) = U(-1) = \\frac{1}{4}((-1)^2 - 1)^2 + 0(-1) = 0$\n    $U(x_S) = U(0) = \\frac{1}{4}((0)^2 - 1)^2 + 0(0) = 0.25$\n4.  Compute action:\n    $\\Delta U = U(x_S) - U(x_L) = 0.25 - 0 = 0.25$\n    $S^{\\star} = \\frac{0.25}{0.05} = 5.0$\n\n**Case 3: $(h,D) = (0.35, 0.05)$**\n1.  Solve $x^3 - x + 0.35 = 0$. The roots are approximately $x_1 \\approx -1.157604$, $x_2 \\approx 0.368832$, $x_3 \\approx 0.788772$.\n2.  We identify $x_L = x_1 \\approx -1.157604$ and $x_S = x_2 \\approx 0.368832$.\n3.  Calculate potentials:\n    $U(x_L) = \\frac{1}{4}((-1.157604)^2-1)^2 + 0.35(-1.157604) \\approx -0.376263$\n    $U(x_S) = \\frac{1}{4}((0.368832)^2-1)^2 + 0.35(0.368832) \\approx 0.315700$\n4.  Compute action:\n    $\\Delta U = U(x_S) - U(x_L) \\approx 0.315700 - (-0.376263) = 0.691963$\n    $S^{\\star} = \\frac{0.691963}{0.05} = 13.83926$\n\n**Case 4: $(h,D) = (0.2, 0.10)$**\n1.  The parameter $h=0.2$ is the same as in Case 1. Therefore, the critical points $x_L$, $x_S$ and the potential barrier $\\Delta U$ are identical to those in Case 1.\n2.  $\\Delta U \\approx 0.479569$.\n3.  The noise intensity is $D = 0.10$.\n4.  Compute action:\n    $S^{\\star} = \\frac{\\Delta U}{D} = \\frac{0.479569}{0.10} = 4.79569$\n\nThe results will be reported to six decimal places as requested.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal action for a stochastic transition in a 1D potential.\n\n    The problem models cellular reprogramming as a noise-induced transition between\n    attractors (minima) of a potential U(x).
