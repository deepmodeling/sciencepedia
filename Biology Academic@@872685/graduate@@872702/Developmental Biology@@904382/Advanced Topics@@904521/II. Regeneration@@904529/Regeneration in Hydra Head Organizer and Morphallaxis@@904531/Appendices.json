By this definition, the uniform steady state in dimensionless variables is $(A,H)=(1,1)$.\n- Time scale: The problem specifies a time scale based on the activator turnover rate, $\\mu_{a}$. The characteristic time is thus $\\tau_{a} = 1/\\mu_{a}$. We define the dimensionless time $\\tau = t/\\tau_{a} = \\mu_{a}t$.\n- Length scale: The problem specifies a length scale based on the balance between activator diffusion and decay. The diffusion term is $D_{a}\\nabla^{2}a$ and the decay term is $-\\mu_{a}a$. A characteristic length $\\ell$ can be found by balancing their magnitudes, i.e., $D_{a}a/\\ell^{2} \\sim \\mu_{a}a$, which yields $\\ell^{2} \\sim D_{a}/\\mu_{a}$.

The original physical domain is $x \\in [0,L]$. The dimensionless coordinate is $y = x/\\ell$. Therefore, the dimensionless domain is $y \\in [0, L/\\ell]$. We define the dimensionless domain size as $\\Lambda = L/\\ell$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\ell$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{D_{a}/\\mu_{a}}} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{a}}{D_{a}}}\n$$\nThe dimensionless system is governed by five independent dimensionless groups:\n$1$. $\\sigma_{a} = \\frac{s_{a}}{\\mu_{a}a_{0}}$: relative activator source strength.\n$2$. $\\sigma_{h} = \\frac{s_{h}}{\\mu_{h}h_{0}}$: relative inhibitor source strength.\n$3$. $\\kappa = \\frac{\\mu_{h}}{\\mu_{a}}$: ratio of inhibitor to activator turnover rates.\n$4$. $d = \\frac{D_{h}}{D_{a}}$: ratio of inhibitor to activator diffusion coefficients.\n$5$. $\\Lambda = L\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{a}}{D_{a}}}$: dimensionless system size.\nThe no-flux boundary conditions $\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial x}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}=0$ transform to $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}=0$ at $y=0$ and $y=\\Lambda$.\n\nThe emergence of spatial patterns is governed by the Turing mechanism. The admissible pattern wavelengths are determined by the range of wavenumbers that are unstable to perturbation. This range is dictated by the condition for Turing instability, which depends crucially on the diffusion ratio $d$ being sufficiently greater than $1$ (long-range inhibition), but also on the local kinetics specified by $\\kappa$, $\\sigma_{a}$, and $\\sigma_{h}$. The characteristic wavelength that grows fastest is a function of all four of these groups.\n\nThe pattern amplitude near the onset of the instability (the Turing bifurcation) is determined by the system's distance from the bifurcation point in parameter space. The bifurcation occurs when a combination of the parameters $\\sigma_{a}, \\sigma_{h}, \\kappa, d$ crosses a critical threshold. The amplitude typically grows as the square root of the deviation of a parameter from its critical value. Therefore, all these kinetic and diffusive parameters collectively control the pattern amplitude.\n\nThe final answer requested is the expression for the dimensionless domain size parameter $\\Lambda$ in terms of only $L$, $D_{a}$, and $\\mu_{a}$.

The problem is well-posed, relying on the standard methods of calculus of variations and algebraic manipulation, and is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires the derivation of the positional value field, $p(x)$, in an intact organism. The second part requires the derivation of the renormalized field, $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x)$, in an excised fragment.\n\nFor the first part, we are tasked with finding the function $p(x)$ that minimizes the functional\n$$\n\\mathcal{J}[p] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(p''(x)\\right)^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nsubject to the boundary conditions $p(0)=0$ and $p(L)=1$. This is a problem in the calculus of variations. The Lagrangian is $F(x, p, p', p'') = (p''(x))^2$. Since the Lagrangian depends on the second derivative of $p(x)$, the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p'}\\right) + \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p''}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFor our specific Lagrangian, we have $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p'} = 0$, and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p''} = 2p''(x)$. Substituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\left(2p''(x)\\right) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad p''''(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a fourth-order ordinary differential equation. The general solution is a cubic polynomial of the form:\n$$\np(x) = C_1 x^3 + C_2 x^2 + C_3 x + C_4\n$$\nwhere $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$ are constants of integration. To determine these constants, we need four boundary conditions. The problem explicitly provides two:\n1.  $p(0) = 0$\n2.  $p(L) = 1$\n\nThe remaining two conditions are the natural boundary conditions that arise from the variational principle when the derivatives of the function are not specified at the boundaries. The first variation of the functional $\\mathcal{J}[p]$ must be zero for any admissible variation $\\delta p(x)$. This requires that the boundary terms resulting from integration by parts vanish. For this functional, the boundary term is $[2p''(x)\\delta p'(x) - 2p'''(x)\\delta p(x)]_0^L$. Since $p(0)$ and $p(L)$ are fixed, any admissible variation must satisfy $\\delta p(0) = 0$ and $\\delta p(L) = 0$. The boundary term thus simplifies to $2p''(L)\\delta p'(L) - 2p''(0)\\delta p'(0)$. Since the variations $\\delta p'(0)$ and $\\delta p'(L)$ are arbitrary, their coefficients must be zero for this expression to vanish. This gives the two natural boundary conditions:\n3.  $p''(0) = 0$\n4.  $p''(L) = 0$\n\nWe now apply these four conditions to the general solution.\nFrom $p(0)=0$, we substitute $x=0$ into the general solution: $p(0) = C_4 = 0$.\nThe second derivative is $p''(x) = 6C_1 x + 2C_2$.\nFrom $p''(0)=0$, we have $p''(0) = 2C_2 = 0$, which implies $C_2=0$.\nFrom $p''(L)=0$, we have $p''(L) = 6C_1 L + 2C_2 = 0$. Since $C_2=0$ and $L>0$, this implies $6C_1 L = 0$, so $C_1=0$.\nWith $C_1=0$, $C_2=0$, and $C_4=0$, the solution simplifies to $p(x) = C_3 x$.\nFinally, we apply the condition $p(L)=1$: $p(L) = C_3 L = 1$, which gives $C_3 = \\frac{1}{L}$.\nThus, the function that minimizes the functional is:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nThis function is strictly increasing, as its derivative $p'(x) = 1/L$ is positive for $L>0$. Furthermore, for this solution, $p''(x)=0$ for all $x \\in [0,L]$, which makes the functional $\\mathcal{J}[p] = \\int_{0}^{L} 0^2 \\, dx = 0$. Since the integrand $(p''(x))^2$ is non-negative, the value $0$ is the absolute minimum possible for $\\mathcal{J}[p]$. This confirms the correctness of the solution for the first part.\n\nFor the second part, we consider a fragment cut from the animal, spanning the interval $[x_1, x_2]$. The new positional field, $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x)$, is assumed to be an affine reparameterization of the original field $p(x)$ on this interval. This means:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x) = A \\cdot p(x) + B\n$$\nfor some constants $A$ and $B$, where $x \\in [x_1, x_2]$. The new field must satisfy the renormalized boundary conditions $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_1)=0$ and $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_2)=1$. We use these conditions to determine $A$ and $B$:\n1.  $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_1) = A \\cdot p(x_1) + B = 0$\n2.  $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_2) = A \\cdot p(x_2) + B = 1$\n\nThis is a system of two linear equations in $A$ and $B$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$$\nA(p(x_2) - p(x_1)) = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, $B = -A \\cdot p(x_1)$. Substituting the expression for $A$:\n$$\nB = -\\frac{p(x_1)}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)}\n$$\nSubstituting $A$ and $B$ back into the expression for $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x)$:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)} - \\frac{p(x_1)}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)} = \\frac{p(x) - p(x_1)}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the explicit form of $p(x) = x/L$ into this general renormalization formula. We have $p(x_1) = x_1/L$ and $p(x_2) = x_2/L$.\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x) = \\frac{\\frac{x}{L} - \\frac{x_1}{L}}{\\frac{x_2}{L} - \\frac{x_1}{L}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{L}(x-x_1)}{\\frac{1}{L}(x_2-x_1)}\n$$\nThe factor of $1/L$ cancels, yielding the final expression for the renormalized field:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x) = \\frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form solutions for both parts of the problem.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{x}{L} & \\frac{x-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2667734"}]}
