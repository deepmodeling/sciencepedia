It presents a simplified but physically and biologically consistent model of tissue growth, based on established principles of cell division and conservation of volume. All necessary parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. We will now proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the minimal integer number of synchronous cell divisions, which we denote by $k$, needed for an initial population of neoblasts, $N_0$, to form a blastema of a given target volume, $V_{\\text{target}}$.\n\nThe givens are:\nThe initial number of neoblasts: $N_0 = 10^5$.\nThe target blastema volume: $V_{\\text{target}} = 0.5~\\mathrm{mm}^3$.\nThe average volume of a single cell: $V_{\\text{cell}} = 1,000~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3$.\n\nThe model is based on several key assumptions:\n1. The extracellular volume fraction is negligible, so the total tissue volume is the sum of the volumes of its constituent cells.\n2. The average cell volume, $V_{\\text{cell}}$, remains constant during the expansion phase.\n3. Mitotic divisions are symmetric and synchronous, meaning the total number of cells doubles with each division cycle.\n\nFirst, we must establish a consistent system of units for volume. The target volume is in cubic millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}^3$) and the cell volume is in cubic micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3$). We convert $V_{\\text{target}}$ to $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3$. The conversion factor between millimeters and micrometers is $1~\\mathrm{mm} = 10^3~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. For volume, this relationship becomes:\n$$1~\\mathrm{mm}^3 = (10^3~\\mu\\mathrm{m})^3 = 10^9~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3$$\nApplying this to the target volume:\n$$V_{\\text{target}} = 0.5~\\mathrm{mm}^3 = 0.5 \\times 10^9~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3$$\nThe cell volume is given as $V_{\\text{cell}} = 1,000~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3 = 10^3~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of cells, $N_{\\text{target}}$, required to constitute the blastema volume. Based on the assumption of negligible extracellular volume:\n$$N_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{target}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$N_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^9~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3}{10^3~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3} = 0.5 \\times 10^{(9-3)} = 0.5 \\times 10^6 = 5 \\times 10^5$$\n\nThe growth of the cell population is governed by the rule of synchronous doubling. Starting with an initial population $N_0$, the number of cells after $k$ divisions, $N_k$, is given by the geometric progression:\n$$N_k = N_0 \\times 2^k$$\n\nWe need to find the minimum integer $k$ for which the cell population $N_k$ is at least equal to the required target number of cells, $N_{\\text{target}}$. This is expressed by the inequality:\n$$N_k \\geq N_{\\text{target}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_k$ and the value for $N_{\\text{target}}$:\n$$ (10^5) \\times 2^k \\geq 5 \\times 10^5$$\n\nTo solve for $k$, we simplify the inequality by dividing both sides by $10^5$:\n$$2^k \\geq 5$$\nTo isolate $k$, we take the logarithm base $2$ of both sides of the inequality. As the logarithm base $2$ is a monotonically increasing function, the inequality direction is preserved:\n$$\\log_2(2^k) \\geq \\log_2(5)$$\n$$k \\geq \\log_2(5)$$\n\nThe value of $\\log_2(5)$ can be evaluated.

The smallest integer greater than or equal to $2.3219...$ is $3$.\nTherefore, the minimal number of synchronous divisions is $k=3$.\n\nWe can verify this result:\n- After $k=2$ divisions: $N_2 = N_0 \\times 2^2 = 10^5 \\times 4 = 4 \\times 10^5$ cells. This is insufficient, as $4 \\times 10^5  5 \\times 10^5$.\n- After $k=3$ divisions: $N_3 = N_0 \\times 2^3 = 10^5 \\times 8 = 8 \\times 10^5$ cells.

EdU incorporates only during deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (S phase). At time $t=0$, EdU is added at saturating concentration and maintained.

Compute the value of $T_c$ in hours.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard cell kinetics experiment (cumulative labeling) applied to a well-established model system (planarian regeneration). The assumptions provided (asynchronous population, steady state, growth fraction of $1$) are standard idealizations used to construct tractable models of cell population dynamics. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient and consistent information to derive the requested relationship and compute the value. It avoids ambiguity by explicitly stating that the data points fall within the linear regime. The problem is a formalizable question in quantitative developmental biology and is not trivial. It is free of scientific flaws, contradictions, and subjective claims.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem demands a derivation from first principles. We begin by defining the key parameters for a population of $N$ cycling cells in a steady state.\n\nLet $T_c$ be the mean cell cycle duration. Since the growth fraction is $1$ and cell loss is negligible during the measurement window, all $N$ cells are actively cycling. In a steady state, the population structure is time-invariant, meaning the number of cells in any given phase of the cycle is constant.\n\nThe flux, $\\Phi$, is the number of cells entering any phase of the cycle per unit time. For a population of size $N$ to completely renew itself over a period $T_c$, the flux must be:\n$$ \\Phi = \\frac{N}{T_c} $$\nThe problem states that the flux into S phase, $\\Phi_S$, is equal to the flux into mitosis, $\\Phi_M$, which is consistent with this steady-state flux, so $\\Phi_S = \\Phi_M = \\Phi = N/T_c$.\n\nThe experiment involves continuous labeling with EdU, which incorporates into the DNA of cells during S phase. Let $LI(t)$ be the labeling index, defined as the fraction of all cells in the population that are labeled at time $t$.\n$$ LI(t) = \\frac{N_{labeled}(t)}{N} $$\nThe rate of increase of the number of labeled cells, $dN_{labeled}/dt$, is equal to the rate at which unlabeled cells enter S phase to become labeled. Since the growth fraction is $1$, all cells entering S phase were previously in G1 and thus unlabeled. Therefore, this rate is simply the flux into S phase, $\\Phi_S$.\n$$ \\frac{dN_{labeled}}{dt} = \\Phi_S = \\frac{N}{T_c} $$\nThe rate of change of the labeling index, $LI(t)$, can now be found:\n$$ \\frac{d(LI)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{N_{labeled}(t)}{N}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN_{labeled}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{N}\\left(\\frac{N}{T_c}\\right) = \\frac{1}{T_c} $$\nThis result establishes that the slope of the total labeling index versus time is the reciprocal of the mean cell cycle time.\n\nNext, we must relate this to the fraction of labeled mitoses, $F_{LM}(t)$. The population of cells in mitosis at-a-glance is a sub-population of the total. In an asynchronous, steady-state population, the properties of the mitotic sub-population reflect the properties of the general population at an earlier time. Specifically, the cells entering mitosis at time $t$ are, on average, those cells that completed S phase and entered G2 phase at time $t - T_{G2}$, where $T_{G2}$ is the mean duration of the G2 phase.\n\nThe fraction of mitoses that are labeled, $F_{LM}(t)$, is determined by the fraction of cells entering mitosis that are labeled. The labeling status of a cell is fixed once it exits S phase. Therefore, the labeled fraction of cells entering mitosis at time $t$ will reflect the overall labeled fraction of the population at the time these cells were traversing the earlier parts of the cycle. A common and effective approximation in this context is that the state of the mitotic population at time $t$ reflects the state of the overall cell population at time $t-T_{G2,avg}$.\n$$ F_{LM}(t) \\approx LI(t-T_{G2}) $$\nThe problem states that $F_{LM}(t)$ increases linearly with time in the regime of interest. Let the slope of this linear portion be $m$.\n$$ m = \\frac{d F_{LM}}{dt} $$\nSubstituting the relationship between $F_{LM}(t)$ and $LI(t)$:\n$$ m \\approx \\frac{d}{dt} \\big( LI(t-T_{G2}) \\big) $$\nLet $u = t - T_{G2}$. The derivative with respect to $t$ is the same as the derivative with respect to $u$, since $du/dt = 1$.\n$$ m = \\frac{d(LI)}{du} \\bigg|_{u=t-T_{G2}} $$\nWe have already shown that the slope of $LI$ with respect to its time argument is $1/T_c$. Therefore:\n$$ m = \\frac{1}{T_c} $$\nThis is the derived relationship: the slope of the linear increase in the fraction of labeled mitoses is equal to the reciprocal of the mean cell cycle length.\n\nWith this relationship, we can compute $T_c$ from the given data. The data points are $(t_1, F_1) = (4 \\text{ h}, 0.30)$ and $(t_2, F_2) = (12 \\text{ h}, 0.70)$.\nThe slope $m$ is calculated as the change in the fraction over the change in time:\n$$ m = \\frac{F_2 - F_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \\frac{0.70 - 0.30}{12 \\text{ h} - 4 \\text{ h}} = \\frac{0.40}{8 \\text{ h}} = 0.05 \\text{ h}^{-1} $$\nUsing the derived relationship $T_c = 1/m$:\n$$ T_c = \\frac{1}{0.05 \\text{ h}^{-1}} = 20 \\text{ h} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures and expressed in scientific notation. The number $20$ has one or two significant figures depending on context; the input data ($0.30$, $0.70$) justifies two.\n\nIn scientific notation with two significant figures, $20$ is written as $2.0 \\times 10^1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.0 \\times 10^{1}}$$", "id": "2662389"}, {"introduction": "Generating a correctly patterned organism requires not only creating cells, but telling them where they are.
