## Introduction
How does a single genome give rise to the vast diversity of cell types that constitute a complex organism? This fundamental question in biology is answered not by changes to the DNA sequence itself, but by the intricate layers of chemical information that control it—the epigenome. At the heart of this regulatory system lies DNA methylation, a powerful and stable mechanism for silencing genes. Understanding this process is key to deciphering how cells establish and maintain their identity, how genomes defend themselves against internal threats, and how these processes go awry in disease.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The capacity of a single genome to direct the development of a multicellular organism with hundreds of distinct cell types is one of the central marvels of biology. This complexity is achieved not by altering the DNA sequence itself, but by establishing and maintaining heritable layers of chemical information superimposed upon it—the [epigenome](@entry_id:272005). Foremost among these epigenetic modifications is DNA methylation, a powerful and versatile mechanism for [gene silencing](@entry_id:138096), genome defense, and the stable propagation of cellular identity. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and molecular machinery that govern the writing, reading, erasing, and interpretation of DNA methylation marks.

### The Chemical Currency of Silencing: [5-methylcytosine](@entry_id:193056) and its Metabolic Origins

In mammals, DNA methylation almost exclusively involves the covalent addition of a methyl group ($-\text{CH}_3$) to the carbon-5 position of the cytosine pyrimidine ring, forming **[5-methylcytosine](@entry_id:193056)** (often denoted as 5mC). While this modification can occur in various sequence contexts, its primary and most functionally understood target is the **CpG dinucleotide**, a sequence where a cytosine is immediately followed by a guanine on the same strand (5'-CG-3'). A key feature of the CpG dinucleotide is its palindromic nature; a CpG on one strand is always paired with a CpG on the complementary strand (5'-...CG...-3' paired with 3'-...GC...-5'). This symmetry is the cornerstone of its heritability, as a methylated CpG on the parental strand can serve as a template to direct methylation on the daughter strand after replication.

The genomic distribution of CpG methylation is far from uniform and is intimately linked to function [@problem_id:2631226]. The bulk of the mammalian genome is heavily methylated at CpG sites. This global methylation is particularly dense within the bodies of actively transcribed genes and across repetitive DNA sequences, such as **transposable elements**. In these contexts, methylation serves as a critical defense mechanism, suppressing the transcriptional and retrotranspositional activity of these potentially mutagenic elements, thereby safeguarding [genome integrity](@entry_id:183755).

In stark contrast, regions of high CpG density, known as **CpG islands**, are typically found at the promoters of approximately 60-70% of mammalian genes, including most constitutively expressed "housekeeping" genes. These promoter-associated CpG islands are paradoxically kept in a largely unmethylated state, which is permissive for transcription. The methylation of a promoter CpG island is a robust and stable signal for long-term [gene silencing](@entry_id:138096).

While CpG methylation is the predominant form, methylation also occurs at non-CpG sites (where H can be A, T, or C), a phenomenon termed **CpH methylation**. In most somatic tissues, CpH methylation is rare. However, it becomes abundant in specific cell types, most notably [pluripotent stem cells](@entry_id:148389) and mature neurons. It is established by a different enzymatic logic than CpG methylation, shows a strong bias for the CpA context, and tends to accumulate within gene bodies while being excluded from active [promoters](@entry_id:149896). Its role is still under intense investigation but is generally associated with [transcriptional regulation](@entry_id:268008) during [neurodevelopment](@entry_id:261793) and in the plastic neuronal state [@problem_id:2631226].

The methyl group appended to cytosine is not synthesized de novo at the site of methylation. Instead, it is supplied by the universal methyl donor, **S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)**. The availability of SAM is directly coupled to the cell's metabolic state through the **one-carbon metabolic pathway** and the **[methionine cycle](@entry_id:173691)** [@problem_id:2631216]. One-carbon units, derived from amino acids like serine and [glycine](@entry_id:176531), are carried by the [cofactor](@entry_id:200224) tetrahydrofolate. Through a series of enzymatic steps involving enzymes like methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), the one-carbon unit is used to remethylate [homocysteine](@entry_id:168970), regenerating the essential amino acid methionine. Methionine is then adenylated by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) to produce the high-energy methyl donor, SAM.

When a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) transfers the methyl group from SAM to a cytosine base, SAM is converted to **S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)**. SAH is a potent product inhibitor of all SAM-dependent methyltransferases, including DNMTs. It binds to the same active site pocket as SAM, acting as a direct **competitive inhibitor**. The cellular methylation potential is therefore exquisitely sensitive to the intracellular ratio of SAM to SAH. For SAH to be cleared and the cycle to continue, it must be hydrolyzed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) into adenosine and [homocysteine](@entry_id:168970). Inhibition of AHCY, for instance, leads to the accumulation of SAH, a decrease in the SAM/SAH ratio, and a subsequent global reduction in DNA methylation activity. For example, in an in vitro system with a DNMT where the Michaelis constant for SAM ($K_m^{\text{SAM}}$) is $5\,\mu\text{M}$ and the [inhibition constant](@entry_id:189001) for SAH ($K_i^{\text{SAH}}$) is $2\,\mu\text{M}$, increasing the SAH concentration from $2\,\mu\text{M}$ to $20\,\mu\text{M}$ at a fixed SAM concentration of $10\,\mu\text{M}$ would decrease the rate of methylation by over threefold, illustrating the powerful regulatory impact of this metabolic feedback [@problem_id:2631216].

### The Writers: Establishing and Perpetuating DNA Methylation Patterns

The enzymes responsible for writing DNA methylation marks are the **DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)**. In mammals, this family is composed of three catalytically active members with a clear [division of labor](@entry_id:190326): DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, along with a catalytically inactive but crucial regulatory partner, DNMT3L.

**Maintenance methylation** is the process of faithfully copying pre-existing methylation patterns onto the daughter DNA strand during S-phase. After semi-conservative DNA replication, each CpG site that was symmetrically methylated on the parent molecule becomes **hemimethylated**—methylated on the parental strand but unmethylated on the newly synthesized strand. This hemimethylated state is the specific substrate for **DNMT1**. The fidelity of this process is paramount for the mitotic [heritability](@entry_id:151095) of cell identity. The maintenance machinery is a marvel of molecular coordination, centered on the replication fork [@problem_id:2631229]. The [sliding clamp](@entry_id:150170) protein **Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA)**, which tethers DNA polymerase to the template, also serves to concentrate DNMT1 at the sites of active DNA synthesis through a direct interaction. However, the key targeting and activation factor is **UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1)**. UHRF1 is a multi-domain protein that acts as a molecular scout. Its **SRA (Set and RING Associated) domain** specifically recognizes and binds to hemimethylated CpG sites, using a remarkable "base-flipping" mechanism to engage the 5mC. Its **Tandem Tudor Domain** can simultaneously recognize repressive histone marks like H3K9me3, further ensuring its localization to regions intended to remain silent. Upon binding, the **RING finger E3 ubiquitin [ligase](@entry_id:139297) domain** of UHRF1 mono-ubiquitylates specific lysines on nearby histone H3 tails. This [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) mark is then read by the **RFTS (Replication Foci Targeting Sequence) domain** of DNMT1, which serves two functions: it recruits DNMT1 to the correct location and relieves an autoinhibitory conformation, allosterically activating DNMT1's catalytic domain. This elegant cascade ensures that DNMT1 activity is spatially and temporally restricted to recently replicated, hemimethylated DNA within the appropriate chromatin context [@problem_id:2941913], [@problem_id:2631229].

In contrast, **de novo methylation** is the process of establishing new methylation patterns on previously unmethylated DNA. This is critical during [embryogenesis](@entry_id:154867), [germline development](@entry_id:183928), and for silencing specific genes during [cellular differentiation](@entry_id:273644). This task is performed by **DNMT3A** and **DNMT3B**. These enzymes do not require a hemimethylated substrate and can methylate both strands of a CpG dinucleotide. Their targeting is intricately linked to the pre-existing chromatin landscape, particularly the state of histone tails [@problem_id:2941913]. Both DNMT3A and DNMT3B, along with their catalytically dead cofactor **DNMT3L**, possess an **ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L) domain**. This domain functions as a [histone](@entry_id:177488) mark "reader" that specifically recognizes the N-terminal tail of [histone](@entry_id:177488) H3 only when it is **unmethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me0)**. Binding to this unmodified H3 tail induces a conformational change that activates the DNMT3 enzyme. Conversely, the presence of H3K4 methylation (H3K4me1/2/3), a hallmark of active or poised promoters, prevents ADD domain binding and thus antagonizes de novo methylation. This provides a direct mechanism to protect active gene [promoters](@entry_id:149896) from inappropriate silencing. Furthermore, the **PWWP domain** of DNMT3A recognizes H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), a mark associated with transcriptional elongation, helping to target de novo methylation to the bodies of transcribed genes.

### The Erasers: Pathways of Active and Passive Demethylation

Just as methylation patterns must be written, they must also be erasable to allow for changes in gene expression and for the global reprogramming of the [epigenome](@entry_id:272005) during development. Demethylation can occur through two distinct routes.

**Passive demethylation** is a replication-dependent process. If the maintenance methylation machinery, primarily DNMT1, fails to act on hemimethylated sites following DNA replication, the methylation mark will be diluted by half with each cell division. A complete loss of methylation at a specific locus requires two rounds of replication without maintenance. This mechanism is employed during early [embryonic development](@entry_id:140647) to partially erase the maternal genome's methylome.

**Active demethylation**, by contrast, is a replication-independent enzymatic process that directly removes the methyl mark or its derivatives from the DNA. This pathway is initiated by the **Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family** of enzymes (TET1, TET2, TET3) [@problem_id:2631240]. TETs are Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that catalyze the iterative oxidation of 5mC. The pathway proceeds as follows:
$$
5\mathrm{mC} \xrightarrow{\text{TET}} 5\mathrm{hmC} \xrightarrow{\text{TET}} 5\mathrm{fC} \xrightarrow{\text{TET}} 5\mathrm{caC}
$$
Here, 5mC is first oxidized to **$5$-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)**, then to **$5$-formylcytosine (5fC)**, and finally to **$5$-carboxylcytosine (5caC)**. While 5hmC can be a stable epigenetic mark in its own right, the further oxidized forms, 5fC and 5caC, are primarily transient intermediates. These modified bases are recognized and excised by the DNA glycosylase **Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG)**, which creates an abasic (AP) site. This initiates the **Base Excision Repair (BER)** pathway. The AP site is cleaved by an AP endonuclease (APE1), the gap is filled with a standard, unmodified cytosine by a DNA polymerase, and the phosphodiester backbone is sealed by a DNA [ligase](@entry_id:139297). This intricate oxidation-and-repair process effectively replaces the methylated cytosine with a naive one, completing the active demethylation process. Experimental inhibition of TET enzymes blocks the entire process, while depletion of TDG leads to the accumulation of 5fC and 5caC, confirming their roles as the specific substrates for base excision in this pathway [@problem_id:2631240].

### The Readers: Translating Methylation into Biological Function

The DNA methylation mark itself does not directly silence transcription. Its function is mediated by a class of proteins known as **"readers,"** which specifically recognize and bind to methylated CpG sites, initiating a cascade of downstream events. The identity of the cytosine modification—5mC versus its oxidized derivatives—is a critical determinant of reader binding [@problem_id:2631201].

The most well-characterized family of 5mC readers are the **Methyl-CpG Binding Domain (MBD) proteins**. This family includes MeCP2, MBD1, and MBD2. The MBD domain uses a combination of base-specific contacts and a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the methyl group of 5mC, allowing for high-affinity binding to methylated CpG dinucleotides. The conversion of 5mC to 5hmC is a pivotal regulatory switch. The addition of a polar hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$) to the methyl group disrupts the favorable hydrophobic interactions within the MBD binding pocket. Consequently, the affinity of MeCP2, MBD1, and MBD2 for 5hmC is drastically reduced, typically by an [order of magnitude](@entry_id:264888) or more, effectively abrogating the silencing signal. MBD3 is an atypical member of this family; due to key amino acid substitutions in its would-be methyl-binding pocket, it binds very weakly to both 5mC and 5hmC and is typically found as part of the NuRD [chromatin remodeling](@entry_id:136789) complex.

Another family of readers are the **Kaiso-like [zinc finger](@entry_id:152628) proteins** (e.g., ZBTB33/Kaiso). These proteins use their [zinc finger](@entry_id:152628) domains to recognize methylated CpG sites, often in a specific sequence context. Similar to MBD proteins, their binding is dependent on hydrophobic contacts with the methyl group and is therefore also strongly disfavored by oxidation to 5hmC.

This differential recognition is a key principle: DNA methylation by DNMTs creates a binding site for silencing readers, while oxidation by TET enzymes erases that binding site, providing a switch to reverse the silencing signal.

### From Reading to Repression: The Mechanisms of Gene Silencing

Once a reader protein such as MeCP2 binds to a methylated promoter, it acts as a molecular scaffold to recruit large **co-repressor complexes**, which are the true effectors of silencing [@problem_id:2631278]. A classic pathway involves MeCP2 recruiting the **NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex**. This complex, in turn, contains or recruits **Histone Deacetylases (HDACs)**, such as HDAC3.

The connection to [histone](@entry_id:177488) state is critical. Histone proteins have N-terminal tails that are rich in positively charged lysine residues, which interact electrostatically with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) acetylate these lysines, neutralizing their positive charge. This weakens the histone-DNA interaction, leading to a more open, "euchromatic" state that is permissive for transcription. Conversely, HDACs remove these acetyl groups, restoring the positive charge on the histone tails. This promotes a stronger interaction with DNA, leading to [chromatin compaction](@entry_id:203333) and a repressive "heterochromatic" state that is inaccessible to the transcription machinery.

By recruiting an HDAC-containing complex, MeCP2 locally increases the rate of [histone deacetylation](@entry_id:181394). This shifts the local steady-state balance towards hypoacetylation, compacting the chromatin at the promoter and physically occluding the binding of [general transcription factors](@entry_id:149307), such as TFIID, which often recognize acetylated histone marks via their bromodomains. Disruption of any link in this chain—MeCP2's ability to bind DNA, its ability to recruit NCoR/SMRT, or the catalytic activity of the recruited HDAC—abolishes the repressive signal. This illustrates a primary mechanism of DNA methylation-dependent silencing: the conversion of a DNA mark into a repressive [histone](@entry_id:177488) state.

### Epigenetic Crosstalk: Self-Reinforcing Loops for Stable Gene States

Epigenetic marks do not function in isolation. They engage in extensive **[crosstalk](@entry_id:136295)**, creating robust feedback loops that stabilize particular gene expression states—either "on" or "off."

The maintenance of unmethylated CpG islands at active promoters is a prime example of a self-reinforcing "on" state [@problem_id:2631224]. The process is initiated by proteins with a **CXXC domain**, which specifically recognize unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. These CXXC proteins (e.g., CFP1) recruit [histone methyltransferase](@entry_id:191547) complexes that deposit the active H3K4me3 mark. As described earlier, H3K4me3 is directly antagonistic to the de novo methylation machinery, as the ADD domains of DNMT3A/B/L are unable to bind H3 tails when lysine 4 is methylated. Thus, a [positive feedback loop](@entry_id:139630) is established: unmethylated DNA recruits factors that lay down an active histone mark (H3K4me3), which in turn repels the enzymes that would methylate the DNA, thereby stably locking in the active, unmethylated state.

Conversely, a powerful reciprocal reinforcement loop maintains silent [heterochromatin](@entry_id:202872) [@problem_id:2941885]. In these regions, DNA methylation and the repressive [histone](@entry_id:177488) mark H3K9me3 are mutually reinforcing. On one hand, H3K9me3 is bound by Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), which recruits H3K9 methyltransferases (like SETDB1), propagating the [histone](@entry_id:177488) mark to neighboring nucleosomes. On the other hand, the presence of H3K9me3 is read by the Tudor domain of UHRF1, which, as part of the maintenance methylation machinery, ensures the faithful propagation of DNA methylation at these sites after replication. The loss of DNA methylation impairs UHRF1 recruitment and can lead to [erosion](@entry_id:187476) of H3K9me3, while the loss of H3K9me3 impairs the full efficiency of the UHRF1-DNMT1 axis. This bidirectional crosstalk creates a highly stable, heritable silent state that is resistant to change.

### Developmental Reprogramming of the Methylome

The mechanisms of writing, reading, and erasing DNA methylation are dynamically deployed during [mammalian development](@entry_id:275907) to reset and re-establish cellular fate. This is most dramatically observed during two major waves of **global demethylation** [@problem_id:2631208].

The first wave occurs in the **zygote and preimplantation embryo**. Following [fertilization](@entry_id:142259), the paternal genome undergoes rapid, TET3-mediated active demethylation. The maternal genome is initially protected and demethylates more slowly and passively across subsequent cell divisions. This global erasure is thought to be essential for establishing [totipotency](@entry_id:137879) in the early embryo. A fascinating exception to this reprogramming is **genomic imprinting**, a phenomenon where certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. The methylation marks at these imprinted control regions (differentially methylated regions, or DMRs) must be protected from the global demethylation wave. This protection is accomplished by the [zinc finger](@entry_id:152628) protein **ZFP57**, which recognizes a specific methylated [sequence motif](@entry_id:169965) within the DMRs. ZFP57, in turn, recruits a complex including **TRIM28 (KAP1)**, which scaffolds the maintenance machinery (DNMT1) and repressive histone methyltransferases to the site, creating a bastion of stable heterochromatin that resists the reprogramming machinery [@problem_id:2631208], [@problem_id:2631224].

The second major wave of demethylation occurs later in development, in the **[primordial germ cells](@entry_id:194555) (PGCs)**. As these cells migrate to the developing gonad, their genomes undergo a near-complete erasure of DNA methylation, involving both active (TET-mediated) and passive mechanisms. Crucially, this wave *erases* the methylation marks at imprinted DMRs. This reset is essential for the germline, as it allows for the subsequent sex-specific re-establishment of imprints during [spermatogenesis](@entry_id:151857) or [oogenesis](@entry_id:152145), ensuring that the next generation inherits the correct parental marks. While most of the genome is wiped clean, some transposable elements are able to "escape" this erasure, again through the recruitment of KRAB-ZFP/TRIM28 complexes that maintain a locally repressive state [@problem_id:2631208]. These dynamic cycles of erasure and rewriting highlight the profound role of DNA methylation machinery in orchestrating the complex choreography of development.
