Consider a simplified one-dimensional model of an oocyte of length $L = 50$ $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ with coordinate $x \\in [0,L]$, where $x=0$ denotes the anterior cortex and $x=L$ denotes the posterior pole. An mRNP is released at time $t=0$ at $x=0$. The posterior pole at $x=L$ acts as an absorbing site (irreversible anchoring), while the anterior cortex at $x=0$ is reflecting (no-flux).

It describes a classical first-passage time problem in one dimension, a standard model in statistical physics applied to a biological context. All parameters, initial conditions, and boundary conditions are clearly specified. The problem is therefore valid and we proceed to its solution.\n\nThe transport of the mRNP complex is a stochastic process governed by the principles of probability conservation. The evolution of the probability density function $P(x,t)$ for the particle's position $x$ at time $t$ is described by the Fokker-Planck equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J(x,t)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $J(x,t)$ is the probability flux. The constitutive relation for the flux, incorporating both drift and diffusion, is:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = v P(x,t) - D \\frac{\\partial P(x,t)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nHere, $v$ is the drift velocity and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. For a spatially uniform environment, $v$ and $D$ are constants. This leads to the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -v \\frac{\\partial P(x,t)}{\\partial x} + D \\frac{\\partial^2 P(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe mean first passage time (MFPT), $T(x_0)$, for a particle starting at an initial position $x_0$ to be absorbed at the boundary of a domain, is governed by the backward Kolmogorov equation. Let $T(x)$ denote the MFPT for a particle starting at position $x \\in [0, L]$. The governing equation for $T(x)$ is:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 T(x)}{dx^2} + v \\frac{d T(x)}{dx} = -1\n$$\nThis is an ordinary differential equation for $T(x)$, subject to boundary conditions determined by the physics at the domain edges $x=0$ and $x=L$. The particle starts at $x=0$. The boundary at $x=L$ is absorbing, which implies that the time to reach this boundary, if starting from it, is zero. Thus, $T(L)=0$. The boundary at $x=0$ is reflecting. For a stochastic process, this implies that any trajectory reaching $x=0$ is immediately returned to the domain. This condition imposes a zero-flux constraint on the probability current in the forward equation. The corresponding boundary condition for the backward equation for MFPT is $\\frac{dT}{dx}(0) = 0$.\n\nWe analyze the two scenarios described in the problem.\n\nScenario 1: Purely motor-driven active transport\nIn this case, diffusion is ignored, so $D=0$. The drift velocity is given as $v > 0$. The governing equation for the MFPT reduces from a second-order to a first-order differential equation:\n$$\nv \\frac{d T(x)}{dx} = -1\n$$\nA first-order equation requires only one boundary condition to determine a unique solution. Since the particle's movement is deterministic towards $x=L$ (as $v>0$), it will never reach the boundary at $x=0$. Therefore, the reflecting boundary condition at $x=0$ is irrelevant, and only the absorbing condition at $x=L$ is physically meaningful.\nIntegrating the equation gives:\n$$\nT(x) = -\\frac{x}{v} + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Applying the boundary condition $T(L)=0$:\n$$\nT(L) = -\\frac{L}{v} + C = 0 \\implies C = \\frac{L}{v}\n$$\nThe MFPT for a particle starting at position $x$ is therefore:\n$$\nT(x) = \\frac{L-x}{v}\n$$\nThe mRNP is released at $x=0$, so its mean first passage time, $T_{\\mathrm{act}}$, is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{act}} = T(0) = \\frac{L}{v}\n$$\nThis result is also obtainable by simple physical reasoning: for a purely deterministic motion with constant speed $v$, the time to travel a distance $L$ is simply $L/v$.\n\nScenario 2: Purely diffusive transport\nIn this case, there is no drift, so $v=0$. The diffusion coefficient is given as $D > 0$. The governing equation for the MFPT becomes a second-order equation:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 T(x)}{dx^2} = -1\n$$\nThis requires two boundary conditions. Both the reflecting condition at $x=0$ and the absorbing condition at $x=L$ are now relevant.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. Absorbing at $x=L$: $T(L)=0$\n2. Reflecting at $x=0$: $\\frac{dT}{dx}(0) = 0$\n\nIntegrating the equation once with respect to $x$:\n$$\nD \\frac{d T(x)}{dx} = -x + C_1\n$$\nApplying the reflecting boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$\nD \\frac{dT}{dx}(0) = -0 + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies the first derivative to $\\frac{d T(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{D}$. Integrating a second time:\n$$\nT(x) = -\\frac{x^2}{2D} + C_2\n$$\nApplying the absorbing boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nT(L) = -\\frac{L^2}{2D} + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{L^2}{2D}\n$$\nThe MFPT for a particle starting at position $x$ is:\n$$\nT(x) = \\frac{L^2 - x^2}{2D}\n$$\nThe mRNP is released at $x=0$, so its mean first passage time, $T_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{diff}} = T(0) = \\frac{L^2}{2D}\n$$\n\nComparison of transport efficiencies\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fold reduction in MFPT, defined as the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{diff}}}{T_{\\mathrm{act}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $T_{\\mathrm{act}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{diff}}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{L^2}{2D}}{\\frac{L}{v}} = \\frac{L^2 v}{2DL} = \\frac{Lv}{2D}\n$$\nThis symbolic expression gives the ratio as a function of the system parameters.

The result shows that for the given parameters, active transport is $175$ times faster than diffusion for localizing the mRNP complex to the posterior pole.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe dynamics of the protein concentration $c(x,t)$ are described by the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation. The change in concentration over time is the sum of the effects of diffusion and reaction:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - \\lambda c\n$$\nHere, $D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}$ is the net diffusive flux into a differential volume element, derived from Fick's second law, and $-\\lambda c$ represents the loss of protein due to first-order degradation.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile, for which the concentration no longer changes in time.
