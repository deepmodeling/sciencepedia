Do not use a percent sign.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the frequency of a specific subset of T lymphocytes, known as T follicular helper ($T_{fh}$) cells, within the total $CD4^+$ T cell population. The analysis is based on a sequential gating strategy from flow cytometry data, which mathematically translates to a chain of conditional probabilities. The problem is well-posed and grounded in correct biological and mathematical principles.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the problem using the language of probability theory. The overarching population is the set of $CD4^+$ T cells, so all probabilities are conditional on a cell being $CD4^+$. We define the following events for a randomly selected cell from this population:\n- Let $E_1$ be the event that the cell is $CXCR5^+$.\n- Let $E_2$ be the event that the cell is $PD-1^{\\text{high}}$.\n- Let $E_3$ be the event that the cell is $ICOS^+$.\n- Let $E_4$ be the event that the cell is $CCR7^{\\text{low}}$.\n\nThe problem operationally defines a $T_{fh}$ cell within the $CD4^+$ gate as a cell satisfying all these criteria. The objective is to compute the probability of the intersection of these events, which we denote as $P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3 \\cap E_4)$.\n\nThe provided experimental data are given as a sequence of conditional frequencies. We translate these into conditional probabilities, noting that the conditioning on $CD4^+$ is implicit in the setup.\n1. The fraction of $CXCR5^+$ cells among $CD4^+$ T cells is $20\\%$. This is the probability of the first event in our sequence:\n$$P(E_1) = 0.20$$\n2. The fraction of $PD-1^{\\text{high}}$ cells among $CXCR5^+ CD4^+$ T cells is $60\\%$. This is a conditional probability, representing the second step in the gating hierarchy:\n$$P(E_2 | E_1) = 0.60$$\n3. The fraction of $ICOS^+$ cells among $PD-1^{\\text{high}} CXCR5^+ CD4^+$ T cells is $75\\%$. This is the next conditional probability in the sequence:\n$$P(E_3 | E_1 \\cap E_2) = 0.75$$\n4. The fraction of $CCR7^{\\text{low}}$ cells among $ICOS^+ PD-1^{\\text{high}} CXCR5^+ CD4^+$ T cells is $80\\%$. This is the final conditional probability:\n$$P(E_4 | E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3) = 0.80$$\n\nThe chain rule of probability is used to find the joint probability of the intersection of these events. The chain rule states:\n$$P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3 \\cap E_4) = P(E_1) \\times P(E_2 | E_1) \\times P(E_3 | E_1 \\cap E_2) \\times P(E_4 | E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3)$$\n\nAttention must be paid to the first given data point: \"Among $CD4^+$ T cells, the fraction that is $CCR7^{\\text{high}}$ is $40\\%$.\" This implies that the marginal probability of a $CD4^+$ cell being $CCR7^{\\text{low}}$ is $P(E_4) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$. This information is extraneous to the calculation required by the sequential gating logic. The sequential model explicitly provides the *conditional* probability $P(E_4 | E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3) = 0.80$, which is the correct value to use in the chain rule. The marginal probability is irrelevant to the specified path of analysis and must be disregarded.\n\nWe now proceed with the calculation by substituting the given conditional probabilities into the chain rule formula:\n$$P(T_{fh} \\text{ among } CD4^{+}) = 0.20 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.75 \\times 0.80$$\n\nTo execute the multiplication in a systematic manner:\nFirst, we compute the product of the first two terms:\n$$0.20 \\times 0.60 = 0.12$$\nNext, we multiply this result by the third term. It is efficient to use fractional representation for $0.75$:\n$$0.12 \\times 0.75 = 0.12 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 0.03 \\times 3 = 0.09$$\nFinally, we multiply this intermediate result by the last term:\n$$0.09 \\times 0.80 = 0.072$$\n\nThus, the expected frequency of the T follicular helper cell gate, as defined by the phenotype $CD4^+ CXCR5^+ PD-1^{\\text{high}} ICOS^+ CCR7^{\\text{low}}$, among the total $CD4^+$ T cell population is $0.072$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.072}\n$$", "id": "2849252"}, {"introduction": "Beyond mere identification, a deep understanding of cell function requires appreciating how context dictates signaling outcomes. This practice presents a classic immunological paradox concerning the receptor PD-$1$, which can mark both functional Tfh cells and exhausted T cells.

You are asked to explain how high PD-$1$ expression can be compatible with effective B cell help in the follicle but associated with dysfunction in the chronic lesion.\n\nUse only the following foundational facts as your starting base:\n\n- PD-$1$ is a coinhibitory receptor whose cytoplasmic tail contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif that recruits Src homology region $2$-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase $2$ (SHP$2$) upon ligand engagement, thereby dampening proximal T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory signaling, including dephosphorylation of CD$28$ and components such as CD$3\\zeta$ and ZAP$70$.\n- PD-L$1$ (CD$274$) is broadly expressed and upregulated by type $1$ interferons and inflammatory cues on myeloid and parenchymal cells; PD-L$2$ (CD$273$) expression is more restricted, found primarily on dendritic cells and activated B cells.\n- T follicular helper (Tfh) cells operate in germinal centers, rely on cognate interactions with B cells and follicular dendritic cells, and deliver help via interleukin $21$ and CD$40$ ligand, supported by costimulation through inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) and CD$28$.\n- T cell exhaustion in chronic antigen exposure is characterized by sustained inhibitory receptor signaling, reduced phosphoinositide $3$-kinase (PI$3$K)–AKT–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, altered transcription factor usage (for example, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) operating with limited activator protein-$1$ (AP-$1$), and induction of thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box (TOX)), and diminished effector function.\n\nWhich option best integrates the ligand landscape, downstream signaling context, and functional outcomes to distinguish high PD-$1$ on Tfh versus high PD-$1$ on exhausted cytotoxic $CD8^{+}$ T cells?\n\nA. In germinal centers, PD-L$2$ on follicular dendritic cells is a co-stimulatory ligand that switches PD-$1$ into an activating receptor to drive PI$3$K–AKT, whereas in chronic infection PD-L$1$ is purely inhibitory by recruiting SHP$2$.\n\nB. In germinal centers, PD-$1$ engagement by PD-L$1$/PD-L$2$ on B cells and follicular dendritic cells is intermittent and occurs amid strong ICOS, CD$40$, and CD$28$ costimulation, so SHP$2$-mediated attenuation preferentially tempers CD$28$ without abolishing TCR-dependent calcium–NFAT signals needed for interleukin $21$ and help; in chronic infection, diffuse and sustained PD-L$1$ engagement on myeloid and parenchymal cells with weak costimulation drives prolonged SHP$2$-dependent dephosphorylation of CD$3\\zeta$, ZAP$70$, and CD$28$, suppresses PI$3$K–AKT–mTOR, and licenses NFAT-driven TOX induction, culminating in exhaustion.\n\nC. The decisive factor is ligand exclusivity: germinal center B cells and follicular dendritic cells lack PD-L$1$ and express only PD-L$2$, which is non-inhibitory for PD-$1$, leaving PD-$1$ functionally silent on Tfh; chronically inflamed tissues express only PD-L$1$, rendering PD-$1$ active on $CD8^{+}$ T cells.\n\nD. High PD-$1$ on Tfh reflects receptor desensitization due to loss of the SHP$2$-binding motif, so PD-$1$ fails to signal even when PD-L$1$ is abundant in follicles; by contrast, exhausted $CD8^{+}$ T cells retain intact PD-$1$ motifs and signal normally.\n\nE. In germinal centers, PD-$1$ ligation directly recruits PI$3$K to its cytoplasmic tail to boost interleukin $21$, whereas in exhausted $CD8^{+}$ T cells PD-$1$ ligation recruits SHP$1$ but not SHP$2$, selectively blocking interferon-$\\gamma$ while sparing other functions.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following observational and foundational information:\n\n**Observational Setup:**\n1.  A comparison is made between two T cell populations, both with high expression of Programmed Cell Death Protein $1$ (PD-$1$).\n2.  Population $1$: Located in the germinal center of a reactive human lymph node. These high PD-$1$ cells are clustered within follicles and form conjugates with B cells and follicular dendritic cells. They are associated with effective B cell help.\n3.  Population $2$: Located in a chronically infected solid organ. These high PD-$1$ cells are dispersed among myeloid and parenchymal cells in an interferon-rich milieu. They are associated with dysfunction.\n\n**Foundational Facts:**\n1.  PD-$1$ is a coinhibitory receptor. Its cytoplasmic tail has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Upon ligand engagement, this motif recruits Src homology region $2$-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase $2$ (SHP$2$). SHP$2$ recruitment dampens proximal T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory signaling, including dephosphorylation of CD$28$ and components such as CD$3\\zeta$ and ZAP$70$.\n2.  PD-L$1$ (CD$274$) is broadly expressed and its expression is upregulated by type $1$ interferons and inflammatory cues on myeloid and parenchymal cells.\n3.  PD-L$2$ (CD$273$) expression is more restricted, found primarily on dendritic cells and activated B cells.\n4.  T follicular helper (Tfh) cells function in germinal centers, relying on cognate interactions with B cells and follicular dendritic cells. They provide help via interleukin $21$ (IL-$21$) and CD$40$ ligand (CD$40$L), supported by costimulation through inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) and CD$28$.\n5.  T cell exhaustion, resulting from chronic antigen exposure, is characterized by: sustained inhibitory receptor signaling, reduced phosphoinositide $3$-kinase (PI$3$K)–AKT–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, altered transcription factor usage (e.g., nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) operating with limited activator protein-$1$ (AP-$1$), and induction of thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box (TOX)), and diminished effector function.\n\n**Question:**\nExplain how high PD-$1$ expression can be compatible with effective B cell help in the follicle but associated with dysfunction in the chronic lesion, by integrating the ligand landscape, downstream signaling context, and functional outcomes to distinguish the two cell types.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria.\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly based on established principles of immunology. The roles of PD-$1$, its ligands PD-L$1$ and PD-L$2$, the function of Tfh cells in germinal centers, and the mechanisms of T cell exhaustion are all standard concepts in the field. The provided \"foundational facts\" are accurate representations of current scientific understanding. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The question asks for a mechanistic explanation distinguishing two observed biological phenomena, based on a provided set of principles. It is structured to have a unique, conceptually-driven answer that synthesizes the given information. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The description of the cellular locations and interactions is objective.\n4.  **Self-Contained and Consistent**: The problem provides sufficient foundational facts to construct a logical explanation. There are no internal contradictions. For instance, the function of PD-$1$ as an inhibitor (Fact $1$) is consistent with the characteristics of T cell exhaustion (Fact $5$).\n5.  **No Other Flaws**: The problem is not metaphorical, trivial, or based on unrealistic premises. It represents a genuine question of biological regulation that is a central topic of study in immunology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically-grounded question that is answerable using the provided foundational facts. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe task is to explain the paradoxical role of high PD-$1$ expression on two T cell populations. The explanation must be built strictly from the provided facts. The core of the problem lies in the context-dependent outcome of PD-$1$ signaling.\n\n**Analysis of the Germinal Center (Tfh) Scenario:**\n-   **Cellular Context**: Tfh cells are in a highly structured microenvironment, the germinal center, where they form cognate interactions with B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (Problem Setup & Fact $4$).\n-   **Activating Signals**: Tfh cell function is supported by a powerful combination of signals: TCR engagement, and strong costimulation via CD$28$ and, critically, ICOS (Fact $4$). The interaction with B cells provides CD$40$-CD$40$L signaling, which is essential for B cell help. This creates a milieu of potent and sustained pro-survival and pro-effector signaling.\n-   **Inhibitory Ligand Context**: The relevant PD-$1$ ligands in the germinal center, expressed on activated B cells, are primarily PD-L$2$ (Fact $3$). PD-L$1$ may also be present. Engagement of PD-$1$ by these ligands is expected to occur during the specific, dynamic cell-cell interactions.\n-   **Signal Integration**: In this context of overwhelming positive stimulation (TCR, CD$28$, ICOS), the inhibitory signal from PD-$1$ does not serve as an 'off' switch. Instead, it acts as a rheostat or a modulator. As described in Fact $1$, PD-$1$ engagement recruits SHP$2$ to dephosphorylate targets like CD$28$, thereby dampening the PI$3$K-AKT pathway which is strongly promoted by CD$28$ and ICOS. This modulation is not absolute; it fine-tunes the T cell response, possibly preventing excessive proliferation or differentiation, and is thought to be critical for the selection of high-affinity B cells. The Tfh cell remains functional, capable of producing IL-$21$ and expressing CD$40$L (Fact $4$), because the foundational activating signals are sufficiently strong and diverse to overcome partial inhibition by PD-$1$.\n\n**Analysis of the Chronic Infection (Exhausted T cell) Scenario:**\n-   **Cellular Context**: T cells are in a disorganized, chronically inflamed tissue, dispersed among myeloid and parenchymal cells (Problem Setup). This environment is described as \"interferon-rich\".\n-   **Activating Signals**: In contrast to the germinal center, this environment is not optimized for T cell activation. Cognate antigen presentation may be present, but the powerful, synergistic costimulation from ICOS and dedicated B cell interactions is absent. Thus, the baseline level of positive signaling is significantly weaker.\n-   **Inhibitory Ligand Context**: Fact $2$ states that PD-L$1$ is broadly expressed and upregulated by interferons on myeloid and parenchymal cells. Therefore, the T cell is constantly bathed in a high concentration of an inhibitory ligand. The engagement of PD-$1$ is not limited to specific, cognate interactions but is diffuse and sustained.\n-   **Signal Integration**: Here, the balance of signals is drastically shifted towards inhibition. The \"sustained inhibitory receptor signaling\" (Fact $5$) from ubiquitous PD-L$1$ engagement leads to chronic and intense recruitment of SHP$2$ (Fact $1$). This overwhelms the weak activating signals, leading to profound dephosphorylation of key signaling nodes like CD$3\\zeta$, ZAP$70$, and CD$28$ (Fact $1$). The consequences, described in Fact $5$, are exactly what one would predict: suppression of the PI$3$K–AKT–mTOR pathway, decoupling of NFAT from AP-$1$ leading to a pro-exhaustion transcriptional program (including TOX induction), and a global loss of effector function. This is T cell exhaustion.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: The functional outcome of high PD-$1$ expression is determined by the balance of concurrent activating signals and the spatiotemporal dynamics of ligand engagement. Strong, localized, and diverse costimulation allows Tfh cells to remain functional despite PD-$1$ expression, whereas weak costimulation combined with chronic, diffuse PD-L$1$ exposure drives T cells into an exhausted state.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n-   **A. In germinal centers, PD-L$2$ on follicular dendritic cells is a co-stimulatory ligand that switches PD-$1$ into an activating receptor to drive PI$3$K–AKT, whereas in chronic infection PD-L$1$ is purely inhibitory by recruiting SHP$2$.**\n    This statement is fundamentally incorrect. Fact $1$ explicitly defines PD-$1$ as a coinhibitory receptor that recruits the phosphatase SHP$2$ to *dampen* signaling. Claiming it can be switched into an activating receptor that drives PI$3$K-AKT directly contradicts the provided foundational principles and established molecular biology. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B. In germinal centers, PD-$1$ engagement by PD-L$1$/PD-L$2$ on B cells and follicular dendritic cells is intermittent and occurs amid strong ICOS, CD$40$, and CD$28$ costimulation, so SHP$2$-mediated attenuation preferentially tempers CD$28$ without abolishing TCR-dependent calcium–NFAT signals needed for interleukin $21$ and help; in chronic infection, diffuse and sustained PD-L$1$ engagement on myeloid and parenchymal cells with weak costimulation drives prolonged SHP$2$-dependent dephosphorylation of CD$3\\zeta$, ZAP$70$, and CD$28$, suppresses PI$3$K–AKT–mTOR, and licenses NFAT-driven TOX induction, culminating in exhaustion.**\n    This option perfectly aligns with the derivation. It correctly identifies the key contextual differences: signal strength (strong costimulation in GC vs. weak in chronic infection) and ligand encounter dynamics (intermittent/localized vs. diffuse/sustained). It accurately applies the signaling mechanisms from Fact $1$ (SHP$2$ recruitment, dephosphorylation of CD$3\\zeta$, ZAP$70$, CD$28$) and the consequences of chronic inhibition from Fact $5$ (suppressed PI$3$K-AKT-mTOR, TOX induction). The description of PD-$1$ modulating the Tfh response while allowing key functions to proceed is mechanistically sound and consistent with all provided facts. **Correct**.\n\n-   **C. The decisive factor is ligand exclusivity: germinal center B cells and follicular dendritic cells lack PD-L$1$ and express only PD-L$2$, which is non-inhibitory for PD-$1$, leaving PD-$1$ functionally silent on Tfh; chronically inflamed tissues express only PD-L$1$, rendering PD-$1$ active on $CD8^{+}$ T cells.**\n    This statement contains multiple factual errors. First, it claims ligand exclusivity, which is an oversimplification not supported by the givens; Fact $2$ says PD-L$1$ is \"broadly expressed\", not absent from lymphoid organs. Second, and more critically, it claims PD-L$2$ is \"non-inhibitory\". This contradicts Fact $1$, which states PD-$1$ is a coinhibitory receptor upon \"ligand engagement\", without specifying that one ligand is inert. Both PD-L$1$ and PD-L$2$ are established inhibitory ligands for PD-$1$. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. High PD-$1$ on Tfh reflects receptor desensitization due to loss of the SHP$2$-binding motif, so PD-$1$ fails to signal even when PD-L$1$ is abundant in follicles; by contrast, exhausted $CD8^{+}$ T cells retain intact PD-$1$ motifs and signal normally.**\n    This is a speculative mechanism not supported by any of the provided facts. Fact $1$ defines the function of PD-$1$ via its SHP$2$-binding motif. To propose that this motif is selectively lost in Tfh cells is an ad hoc hypothesis introduced without any basis in the givens. The problem is about interpreting the function of intact PD-$1$ in different contexts, not about postulating mutations. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **E. In germinal centers, PD-$1$ ligation directly recruits PI$3$K to its cytoplasmic tail to boost interleukin $21$, whereas in exhausted $CD8^{+}$ T cells PD-$1$ ligation recruits SHP$1$ but not SHP$2$, selectively blocking interferon-$\\gamma$ while sparing other functions.**\n    This statement makes two claims that contradict Fact $1$. First, it claims PD-$1$ recruits PI$3$K, an activating kinase, which is the opposite of recruiting SHP$2$, an inhibitory phosphatase. Second, it claims that in exhaustion, PD-$1$ recruits SHP$1$ but not SHP$2$. Fact $1$ explicitly states recruitment of SHP$2$. While SHP$1$ can also be involved in inhibitory signaling, the primary target of the PD-$1$ ITSM is SHP$2$. Thus, this option misrepresents the fundamental signaling pathway described in the problem's own premises. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2849279"}, {"introduction": "The interactions between individual Tfh and B cells culminate in population-level dynamics that drive adaptive immunity.

There are no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The task is to compute a specific metric based on the provided discrete-time dynamical system. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe model describes the evolution of frequencies $p_i(t)$ of $K$ competing B cell clones.

We substitute the expressions for $h_i(t)$ and $F_i(t)$ into the update rule:\n$$\np_i(t+1) = \\frac{p_i(t) \\left( a_i^\\gamma \\left( \\frac{a_i^\\eta p_i(t)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k^\\eta p_k(t)} \\right)^\\delta \\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} p_j(t) \\left( a_j^\\gamma \\left( \\frac{a_j^\\eta p_j(t)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k^\\eta p_k(t)} \\right)^\\delta \\right)}\n$$\nThe term $(\\sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k^\\eta p_k(t))^{-\\delta}$ is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels. This leads to the simplified recurrence:\n$$\np_i(t+1) = \\frac{p_i(t) a_i^\\gamma a_i^{\\eta\\delta} p_i(t)^\\delta}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} p_j(t) a_j^\\gamma a_j^{\\eta\\delta} p_j(t)^\\delta} = \\frac{a_i^{\\gamma + \\eta\\delta} p_i(t)^{1+\\delta}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} a_j^{\\gamma + \\eta\\delta} p_j(t)^{1+\\delta}}\n$$\nThis form connects the frequencies at time $t+1$ directly to the frequencies at time $t$ and the fixed parameters, avoiding the explicit calculation of intermediate quantities $h_i(t)$ and $F_i(t)$ in each step. This is the relation we will implement.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to find the Simpson concentration $S$ for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Initialize the parameters for the specific case: the affinity vector $\\mathbf{a}$, and the exponents $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$. The values $K=4$, $T=5$, and $\\eta=1.0$ are fixed.\n2.  Initialize the frequency vector $p(0)$ as a uniform distribution: $p_i(0) = 1/4$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n3.  Iterate the simplified recurrence relation for $t$ from $0$ to $T-1=4$. In each iteration, the vector $p(t)$ is used to compute $p(t+1)$.\n4.  After $T=5$ rounds, the final frequency distribution $p(T)$ is obtained.\n5.  Compute the Simpson concentration $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i(T)^2$.\n\nAnalysis of special cases provides a verification of the model's logic.\n- Case 5: $(\\gamma, \\delta, \\mathbf{a}) = (0.0, 0.0, \\mathbf{a}^{(1)})$. The exponents in the simplified recurrence become $\\gamma+\\eta\\delta=0$ and $1+\\delta=1$. The update rule is $p_i(t+1) = \\frac{a_i^0 p_i(t)^1}{\\sum_j a_j^0 p_j(t)^1} = \\frac{p_i(t)}{\\sum_j p_j(t)} = p_i(t)$, since $\\sum_j p_j(t)=1$. The frequencies do not change from their initial state. Thus, $p_i(T) = p_i(0) = 1/4$ for all $i$. The Simpson concentration is $S = \\sum_{i=1}^4 (1/4)^2 = 4 \\times (1/16) = 1/4 = 0.25$.\n- Case 6: $(\\gamma, \\delta, \\mathbf{a}) = (1.0, 1.0, \\mathbf{a}^{(2)})$. Here, the affinities are homogeneous: $a_i = 1.0$ for all $i$. The term $a_i^{\\gamma+\\eta\\delta}$ is equal to $1.0^{\\gamma+\\eta\\delta}=1.0$ for all clones and can be factored out of the summation and cancelled. The update rule simplifies to $p_i(t+1) = \\frac{p_i(t)^{1+\\delta}}{\\sum_j p_j(t)^{1+\\delta}}$. Because all clones start with identical frequencies $p_i(0)=1/4$, they will evolve identically. Frequencies remain uniform at $1/4$ throughout the simulation. Therefore, $S = 0.25$ for this case as well.\n\nThese analytical results for cases $5$ and $6$ serve as a baseline against which the results of selection under heterogeneous affinities can be compared. For the remaining cases, the described algorithm will be executed computationally.
