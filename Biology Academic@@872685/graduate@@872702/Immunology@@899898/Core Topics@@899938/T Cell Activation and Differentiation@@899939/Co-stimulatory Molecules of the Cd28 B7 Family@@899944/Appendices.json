The kinetic constants are within a realistic range for this type of transient protein-protein interaction.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe interaction between a soluble analyte, $A$ (CD28), and a surface-immobilized ligand, $L$ (CD86), to form a complex, $C$ (CD28-CD86 complex), can be represented by the single-site reversible reaction:\n$$A + L \\rightleftharpoons C$$\nThis reaction is governed by the law of mass action. The rate of formation of the complex (association) is proportional to the concentrations of the free analyte, $[A]$, and the free ligand, $[L]$. The rate constant for this process is the association rate constant, $k_{\\text{on}}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{association}} = k_{\\text{on}} [A] [L] $$\nThe rate of breakdown of the complex (dissociation) is proportional to the concentration of the complex, $[C]$. The rate constant for this process is the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{dissociation}} = k_{\\text{off}} [C] $$\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of change of the complex concentration is zero. This occurs when the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{association}} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{dissociation}} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} [A]_{\\text{eq}} [L]_{\\text{eq}} = k_{\\text{off}} [C]_{\\text{eq}} $$\nwhere the subscript 'eq' denotes the concentrations at equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{D}$, is defined by the concentrations of the species at equilibrium:\n$$ K_{D} \\equiv \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [L]_{\\text{eq}}}{[C]_{\\text{eq}}} $$\nBy rearranging the equilibrium rate equation, we can express this ratio in terms of the kinetic rate constants:\n$$ \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [L]_{\\text{eq}}}{[C]_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} $$\nTherefore, the derivation concludes that the equilibrium dissociation constant is the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant:\n$$ K_{D} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} $$\n\nThis derivation is valid for the specified SPR experiment because the experiment is designed to be in a **reaction-limited regime**. In SPR, the response signal, $R$, is directly proportional to the mass of analyte bound to the surface, which corresponds to the concentration of the complex, $[C]$. The rate of change of the response is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}} [A] (R_{\\text{max}} - R) - k_{\\text{off}} R $$\nThis model assumes that the analyte concentration at the sensor surface is equal to the bulk analyte concentration, $[A]$, that is being flowed over the chip. This assumption holds only if the rate of mass transport (diffusion and convection) of analyte to the surface is much faster than the rate of its consumption by the binding reaction. If this condition is not met (a mass-transport limited regime), the analyte concentration at the surface would be depleted, and the observed kinetics would be convoluted with diffusion rates, leading to an inaccurate, underestimated $k_{\\text{on}}$. The experimental design explicitly mitigates this by using a low ligand density (approximately 150 RU) to reduce the rate of analyte consumption and a high flow rate (50 $\\mu\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$) to maximize the rate of analyte replenishment at the surface. Under these reaction-limited conditions, the law of mass action applies correctly using the bulk concentration, and the measured $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ represent the intrinsic molecular kinetic parameters. Consequently, the derived relationship $K_{D} = k_{\\text{off}} / k_{\\text{on}}$ accurately reflects the thermodynamic affinity of the molecular interaction.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $K_{D}$ using the provided experimental results:\n-   $k_{\\text{on}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{\\text{off}} = 0.625 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ K_{D} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{0.625 \\; \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.25 \\times 10^{5} \\; \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ K_{D} = \\frac{0.625}{1.25} \\times 10^{-5} \\; \\mathrm{M} $$\n$$ K_{D} = 0.500 \\times 10^{-5} \\; \\mathrm{M} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\; \\mathrm{M} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in nanomolar (nM).

The problem is formalizable and requires non-trivial reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is adjudicated to be **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nTo predict the alteration of the dose–response curve $R(A)$, we must construct a minimal biophysical model consistent with the stated principles.\n\n1.  **Modeling the Signaling Pathways:**\n    - The TCR-dependent pathway (\"signal $1$\") activates NFAT. We model its antigen-dependent activity, $S_1(A)$, as a normalized Hill function, consistent with the problem description:\n      $$S_1(A) = \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h}$$\n      where $h$ is the Hill coefficient of the TCR signaling module and $K_T$ is its half-saturation constant. $S_1(A)$ varies between $0$ and $1$.\n\n    - The AP-$1$/NF-κB activity, which we denote $S_2(A)$, is supplied by two sources: a strong, primary contribution from CD$28$ and a weak contribution from the TCR itself.\n        - The CD$28$ contribution is constant because the B$7$ ligand density is \"fixed, saturating\". Let us denote this constant positive term as $C$.\n        - The weak TCR-dependent contribution to $S_2$ can be modeled as being proportional to the primary TCR signal, $S_1(A)$, with a small proportionality constant $\\epsilon \\ll C$.\n        - Therefore, the total AP-$1$/NF-κB activity is:\n          $$S_2(A) = C + \\epsilon S_1(A) = C + \\epsilon \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h}$$\n\n2.  **Modeling Signal Integration:**\n    - The IL-$2$ promoter logic is described as \"conjunctive promoter logic\" and \"synergistic, AND-like integration\". The simplest mathematical representation of such an AND-gate is a multiplicative model, where the final response $R(A)$ is proportional to the product of the activities of the necessary transcription factor groups (NFAT, driven by $S_1$, and AP-$1$/NF-κB, represented by $S_2$).\n      $$R(A) = k \\cdot S_1(A) \\cdot S_2(A)$$\n      where $k$ is a scaling constant.\n\n3.  **Formulating Response Functions for Both Conditions:**\n    - **Wild-Type (WT):** With intact CD$28$ signaling, $C  0$. The response is:\n      $$R_{\\text{WT}}(A) = k \\left( \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right) \\left( C + \\epsilon \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right)$$\n    - **CD$28$-deficient (-/-):** With CD$28$ signaling removed, the constant contribution $C$ becomes zero. The response is:\n      $$R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) = k \\left( \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right) \\left( 0 + \\epsilon \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right) = k \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{A^h}{K_T^h + A^h} \\right)^2$$\n\n4.  **Comparing Dose-Response Curve Characteristics:**\n    Let us denote the normalized Hill function $S_1(A)$ as $x(A)$ for simplicity.\n    $R_{\\text{WT}}(A) = kC \\cdot x(A) + k\\epsilon \\cdot x(A)^2$\n    $R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) = k\\epsilon \\cdot x(A)^2$\n\n    -   **Maximal Response ($R_{\\text{max}}$):** This is the limit as $A \\to \\infty$, where $x(A) \\to 1$.\n        $R_{\\text{max, WT}} = kC \\cdot 1 + k\\epsilon \\cdot 1^2 = k(C+\\epsilon)$\n        $R_{\\text{max, -/-}} = k\\epsilon \\cdot 1^2 = k\\epsilon$\n        Since $C  0$, it is unambiguous that $R_{\\text{max, -/-}}  R_{\\text{max, WT}}$. The maximal response is reduced.\n\n    -   **Half-Maximal Concentration ($EC_{50}$):** This is the concentration $A$ where the response is $R_{max}/2$.\n        For the -/- case: $R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) = \\frac{1}{2} R_{\\text{max, -/-}} \\implies k\\epsilon \\cdot x(A)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k\\epsilon \\implies x(A) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n        For the WT case: $R_{\\text{WT}}(A) = \\frac{1}{2} R_{\\text{max, WT}} \\implies kC \\cdot x(A) + k\\epsilon \\cdot x(A)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(C+\\epsilon)$. Since $C \\gg \\epsilon$, the $x(A)^2$ term is small compared to the $C \\cdot x(A)$ term around the midpoint. Thus, $kC \\cdot x(A) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}kC$, which implies $x(A) \\approx 1/2$.\n        To reach the half-maximal response, the required TCR signal level is higher in the -/- case ($x(A) = 1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$) than in the WT case ($x(A) \\approx 0.5$). Since $x(A)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $A$, this means $EC_{50, \\text{-/-}}  EC_{50, \\text{WT}}$. The dose-response curve shifts to the right.\n\n    -   **Apparent Hill Slope (Cooperativity):** The slope of the dose-response reflects its cooperativity. We can examine the behavior at low antigen concentrations where $A \\ll K_T$, so $x(A) \\approx (A/K_T)^h$.\n        $R_{\\text{WT}}(A) \\approx kC(A/K_T)^h + k\\epsilon(A/K_T)^{2h}$. As $C \\gg \\epsilon$, the response is dominated by the first term: $R_{\\text{WT}}(A) \\propto A^h$. The apparent cooperativity is close to $h$.\n        $R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) = k\\epsilon \\left( (A/K_T)^h \\right)^2 = k\\epsilon (A/K_T)^{2h}$. Here, $R_{\\text{-/-}}(A) \\propto A^{2h}$. The apparent cooperativity is close to $2h$.\n        Since $2h  h$ (for $h0$), the dose-response curve for the CD$28$-/- condition is more cooperative, meaning it has a steeper apparent Hill slope than the WT curve. The WT response is \"linearized\" by the large, constant CD$28$-dependent signal $C$, which adds a quasi-linear term in $x(A)$ that dominates the response shape. Loss of this term unmasks a higher-order, more cooperative response.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:** Removing CD$28$ signaling causes:\n1.  A decrease in the maximal response.\n2.  An increase in the $EC_{50}$ (a rightward shift).\n3.  An increase in the apparent Hill slope (a steeper curve).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The dose–response shifts rightward (higher $EC_{50}$), the maximal response is reduced, and the apparent Hill slope (cooperativity) becomes steeper due to loss of a CD28-dependent quasi-linear term in the conjunctive promoter drive.**\n    - This option claims a rightward shift, reduced maximum, and steeper slope. This precisely matches all three predictions from our model. The provided reason, \"loss of a CD28-dependent quasi-linear term\", perfectly describes the mechanism in our model, where the $kC \\cdot x(A)$ term is lost upon CD$28$ removal, making the response steeper.\n    - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The dose–response shifts leftward (lower $EC_{50}$) and the maximal response increases because TCR signaling compensates multiplicatively when CD28 is absent.**\n    - This predicts a leftward shift and increased maximum. Both are contrary to our derivation and established immunological findings.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Only vertical rescaling occurs: the maximal response decreases but $EC_{50}$ and slope are unchanged because co-stimulation is a pure gain factor on a fixed TCR curve.**\n    - This describes a model where $R(A) = G \\cdot S_1(A)$. This predicts no change in $EC_{50}$ or slope, which contradicts our model reflecting synergistic AND-like logic.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Only a horizontal shift occurs: $EC_{50}$ increases, but the maximal response and slope are unchanged because co-stimulation alters sensitivity but not efficacy.**\n    - This describes a model where $R(A) \\propto S_1(A, K_{eff})$ with CD$28$ altering $K_{eff}$. This predicts no change in maximum response, which is incorrect.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. The dose–response shifts rightward and the maximal response is reduced, but the apparent Hill slope becomes shallower because the synergistic nonlinearity is lost with CD28 blockade.**\n    - This option correctly identifies the rightward shift and reduced maximum. However, it incorrectly claims the slope becomes shallower. As derived, the slope becomes steeper. The reasoning provided (\"synergistic nonlinearity is lost\") is conceptually flawed within the context of the multiplicative model; the synergy in the WT case makes the response *less* steep (more linear with respect to the transduced signal $x(A)$) than the purely quadratic -/- case.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2841941"}, {"introduction": "Immune responses are not monolithic; they involve the competition and selection of lymphocyte clones.

For each case, specify $n$, $r$, $k$, and $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ as follows:\n- Case 1: $n=2$, $r = [1.0, 1.0]$, $k = [0.5, 0.5]$, $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.5$.\n- Case 2: $n=3$, $r = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]$, $k = [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]$, $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.3$.\n- Case 3: $n=2$, $r = [0.1, 5.0]$, $k = [0.5, 0.5]$, $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2.0$.\n- Case 4: $n=4$, $r = [2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3.0]$, $k = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]$, $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10.0$.\n- Case 5: $n=3$, $r = [1.0, 0.2, 3.0]$, $k = [0.2, 2.0, 0.2]$, $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each case, output a list containing: the dominant clone index $d$ using zero-based indexing, the Gini coefficient $G$ rounded to $6$ decimal places, followed by the $n$ values of $p_i$ each rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n- Aggregate the results from all cases into a single line as a list of these per-case lists, printed exactly in a single line as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n- Example of the final line format (with placeholder numbers): \n$[ [d_1, G_1, p_{1,1}, \\dots, p_{1,n_1}], [d_2, G_2, p_{2,1}, \\dots, p_{2,n_2}], \\dots ]$.\n\nYour program must compute these values from first principles given above and produce the single required output line. No external input is provided; all parameters are embedded in the program.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of physical chemistry and immunology, specifically the Law of Mass Action for receptor-ligand binding. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and constraints for a unique, deterministically computable solution. The language is objective and mathematically precise. We shall therefore proceed with the derivation of the solution from first principles.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the equilibrium state of a system where $n$ different Tfh cell clones compete for a limited pool of a single ligand, ICOSL. The interaction for each clone $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ is governed by its total receptor capacity, $r_i$, and its receptor-ligand dissociation constant, $k_i$. The total amount of ligand is fixed at $L_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nWe begin with the Law of Mass Action for the binding reaction of clone $i$. The dissociation constant $k_i$ is given by the ratio of concentrations at equilibrium:\n$$ k_i = \\frac{[R_i]_{\\text{free}} [L]_{\\text{free}}}{[C_i]} $$\nIn the notation of the problem, $[R_i]_{\\text{free}}$ is the concentration of free receptors on clone $i$, which is $r_i - c_i$, where $c_i$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex. $[L]_{\\text{free}}$ is the concentration of free ligand, denoted $L_{\\text{free}}$. $[C_i]$ is $c_i$. Substituting these gives:\n$$ k_i = \\frac{(r_i - c_i) L_{\\text{free}}}{c_i} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the equilibrium complex concentration $c_i$ as a function of the free ligand concentration $L_{\\text{free}}$:\n$k_i c_i = (r_i - c_i) L_{\\text{free}} \\implies k_i c_i = r_i L_{\\text{free}} - c_i L_{\\text{free}} \\implies c_i(k_i + L_{\\text{free}}) = r_i L_{\\text{free}}$.\nThis yields the binding isotherm for each clone:\n$$ c_i(L_{\\text{free}}) = \\frac{r_i L_{\\text{free}}}{k_i + L_{\\text{free}}} $$\nThis expression shows that the amount of ligand bound by a clone depends on the concentration of free ligand, its receptor capacity, and its binding affinity (inversely related to $k_i$).\n\nThe second fundamental principle is the conservation of mass for the ligand. The total ligand concentration $L_{\\text{tot}}$ must equal the sum of the free ligand and all ligand bound by the different clones:\n$$ L_{\\text{tot}} = L_{\\text{free}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i $$\nBy substituting the expression for $c_i(L_{\\text{free}})$ into this conservation law, we obtain a single equation with a single unknown, $L_{\\text{free}}$:\n$$ L_{\\text{tot}} = L_{\\text{free}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{r_i L_{\\text{free}}}{k_i + L_{\\text{free}}} $$\nTo find the equilibrium state, we must solve for $L_{\\text{free}}$. This is a root-finding problem for the function $f(x) = 0$, where $x = L_{\\text{free}}$:\n$$ f(x) = x + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{r_i x}{k_i + x} - L_{\\text{tot}} = 0 $$\nAs required, we must establish that a unique, physically meaningful solution for $L_{\\text{free}}$ exists. The physical domain for $L_{\\text{free}}$ is $[0, L_{\\text{tot}}]$.\nLet's analyze $f(x)$ on this interval.\nFirst, we evaluate the function at the interval boundaries:\nAt $x=0$, we have $f(0) = 0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{r_i \\cdot 0}{k_i + 0} - L_{\\text{tot}} = -L_{\\text{tot}}$. Given $L_{\\text{tot}} \\ge 0$, we have $f(0) \\le 0$.\nAt $x=L_{\\text{tot}}$, we have $f(L_{\\text{tot}}) = L_{\\text{tot}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{r_i L_{\\text{tot}}}{k_i + L_{\\text{tot}}} - L_{\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{r_i L_{\\text{tot}}}{k_i + L_{\\text{tot}}}$. Since $r_i \\ge 0$, $k_i  0$, and $L_{\\text{tot}} \\ge 0$, this sum is non-negative, so $f(L_{\\text{tot}}) \\ge 0$.\nSince $f(x)$ is continuous on $[0, L_{\\text{tot}}]$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one root in this interval.\n\nTo prove uniqueness, we examine the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{r_i x}{k_i + x} - L_{\\text{tot}} \\right) = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{r_i x}{k_i + x} \\right) $$\nUsing the quotient rule on the term in the sum, we find:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{r_i x}{k_i + x} \\right) = \\frac{r_i(k_i+x) - r_i x(1)}{(k_i+x)^2} = \\frac{r_i k_i}{(k_i+x)^2} $$\nThe full derivative is thus:\n$$ f'(x) = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{r_i k_i}{(k_i+x)^2} $$\nSince $r_i \\ge 0$ and $k_i  0$, every term in the summation is non-negative. Therefore, $f'(x) \\ge 1$ for all $x \\ge 0$. A strictly monotonically increasing function can have at most one root. This proves that there is a unique root for $L_{\\text{free}}$ in the interval $[0, L_{\\text{tot}}]$. This rigorous finding allows us to employ a numerical method like Brent's method to robustly find this unique solution.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, define the function $f(L_{\\text{free}})$ based on the provided parameters $n$, $r$, $k$, and $L_{\\text{tot}}$.\n2.  Solve $f(L_{\\text{free}}) = 0$ numerically for $L_{\\text{free}}$ within the bracket $[0, L_{\\text{tot}}]$. A trivial case is $L_{\\text{tot}}=0$, which directly gives $L_{\\text{free}}=0$.\n3.  Calculate the vector of complex concentrations $c_i$ for all clones using the determined $L_{\\text{free}}$.\n4.  Calculate the signaling outputs $S_i = s_{\\max} \\cdot \\frac{c_i}{s_{1/2} + c_i}$, using the given constants $s_{\\max}=1.0$ and $s_{1/2}=0.3$.\n5.  Compute the fitness values $F_i = S_i^{\\gamma}$, with the nonlinearity parameter $\\gamma=2.0$.\n6.  The dominant clone index $d$ is determined as the smallest zero-based index $i$ corresponding to the maximum value in the fitness vector $F$.\n7.  The normalized clonal expansion weights are calculated as $p_i = \\frac{F_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} F_j}$. In the case where $\\sum F_j = 0$ (e.g., if all $r_i = 0$), we take $p_i = 1/n$ for all clones, reflecting a lack of selection pressure.\n8.  The Gini coefficient $G$ is calculated to quantify the inequality of the distribution of weights $p = (p_1, \\dots, p_n)$:\n    $$ G = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\lvert p_i - p_j \\rvert}{2n \\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\lvert p_i - p_j \\rvert}{2n} $$\n9.  The results ($d$, $G$, and all $p_i$) for each case are collected and formatted according to the output specification.\nThis procedure provides a complete solution derived from the fundamental principles specified in the problem.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes clonal competition dynamics based on a receptor-ligand equilibrium model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Global parameters for all test cases as specified in the problem\n    s_max = 1.0\n    s_half = 0.3\n    gamma = 2.0\n\n    # Test suite defined in the problem statement\n    test_cases = [\n        {'n': 2, 'r': np.array([1.0, 1.0]), 'k': np.array([0.5, 0.5]), 'L_tot': 0.5},\n        {'n': 3, 'r': np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0]), 'k': np.array([0.1, 1.0, 10.0]), 'L_tot': 0.3},\n        {'n': 2, 'r': np.array([0.1, 5.0]), 'k': np.array([0.5, 0.5]), 'L_tot': 2.0},\n        {'n': 4, 'r': np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3.0]), 'k': np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]), 'L_tot': 10.0},\n        {'n': 3, 'r': np.array([1.0, 0.2, 3.0]), 'k': np.array([0.2, 2.0, 0.2]), 'L_tot': 1.0},\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, r, k, L_tot = case['n'], case['r'], case['k'], case['L_tot']\n\n        # Define the root-finding function based on ligand conservation\n        def f_equilibrium(L_free, r_vals, k_vals, L_total):\n            # Sum of bound ligand across all clones\n            # A check for k_vals + L_free being zero is not required as k0, L_free=0\n            bound_ligand = np.sum(r_vals * L_free / (k_vals + L_free))\n            return L_free + bound_ligand - L_total\n\n        # Step 1: Solve for the unique equilibrium free ligand concentration, L_free\n        if L_tot == 0:\n            L_free = 0.0\n        else:\n            # The root is guaranteed to be in [0, L_tot]\n            L_free = brentq(f_equilibrium, 0.0, L_tot, args=(r, k, L_tot))\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate complex concentration c_i for each clone\n        # This calculation is safe as k_i  0 and L_free = 0, so denominator  0\n        c = r * L_free / (k + L_free)\n        c = np.nan_to_num(c) # Robustness for any unexpected floating point issues\n\n        # Step 3: Calculate signaling output S_i for each clone\n        # The denominator s_half + c is  0 since s_half  0 and c = 0\n        S = s_max * c / (s_half + c)\n        S = np.nan_to_num(S)\n\n        # Step 4: Calculate clonal fitness F_i\n        F = S ** gamma\n\n        # Step 5: Identify dominant clone index d (smallest index for max F)\n        d = int(np.argmax(F))\n\n        # Step 6: Calculate normalized expansion weights p_i\n        F_sum = np.sum(F)\n        if F_sum  0:\n            p = F / F_sum\n        else:\n            # Undefined selection, assume uniform distribution\n            p = np.full(n, 1.0 / n)\n            \n        # Step 7: Calculate Gini coefficient G\n        # Using the formula G = sum(|p_i - p_j|) / (2 * n * sum(p_i))\n        p_col_vector = p.reshape(-1, 1)\n        abs_diff_matrix = np.abs(p_col_vector - p)\n        gini_numerator = np.sum(abs_diff_matrix)\n        \n        # sum(p) is 1.0 in theory, but using np.sum(p) is more robust to float errors\n        gini_denominator = 2 * n * np.sum(p)\n        \n        if gini_denominator  0:\n            G = gini_numerator / gini_denominator\n        else:\n            G = 0.0 # No inequality if all weights are zero\n\n        # Step 8: Format results for the current case as specified\n        G_rounded = round(G, 6)\n        p_rounded = [round(val, 6) for val in p]\n        \n        case_result = [d, G_rounded] + p_rounded\n        all_results.append(case_result)\n\n    # Print the aggregated results in the specified single-line format.\n    # The template's print format is used, which renders without extra spaces.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, all_results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2841892"}]}
