Consider these well-tested facts that serve as a base for reasoning: (i) the Complement component $C1$ complex of the classical pathway is composed of $C1q$, $C1r$, and $C1s$, and the association of $C1r$ and $C1s$ with $C1q$ is $Ca^{2+}$-dependent; removal of $Ca^{2+}$ causes $C1r$ and $C1s$ to dissociate from $C1q$; (ii) the lectin pathway is initiated by Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) complexed with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) through $Ca^{2+}$-dependent interactions; (iii) the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase, $C3bBb$, requires $Mg^{2+}$ for factor $B$ binding to $C3b$ and for factor $D$ activity, and does not require $Ca^{2+}$ for assembly; and (iv) Ethylene Glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) is a chelator that binds $Ca^{2+}$ with much higher affinity than $Mg^{2+}$, such that in the presence of EGTA plus excess $Mg^{2+}$, free $Ca^{2+}$ is effectively removed while free $Mg^{2+}$ remains available.\n\nThe researcher treats normal human serum with EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$ and performs hemolytic assays. In antibody-sensitized erythrocyte assays (classical pathway-dependent), lysis drops markedly after EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$ treatment. In assays that selectively read out the alternative pathway, activity persists. The researcher then reintroduces $Ca^{2+}$ to the EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$-treated serum and observes that antibody-sensitized erythrocyte lysis is restored.\n\nBased on the principles stated above, which statement best predicts which pathway(s) remain active under EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$ and correctly explains how reintroducing $Ca^{2+}$ restores classical pathway activity?\n\nA. Under EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$, only the alternative pathway remains active because $C3bBb$ assembly is $Mg^{2+}$-dependent and $Ca^{2+}$-independent; adding back $Ca^{2+}$ saturates EGTA and provides free $Ca^{2+}$ to stabilize the $C1q$–$C1r$–$C1s$ complex, enabling cleavage of $C4$ and $C2$ to form the classical $C3$ convertase $C4b2a$.\n\nB.

Under EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$, all complement pathways are inactivated because EGTA chelates both $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$; adding back $Ca^{2+}$ cannot restore activity because complement proteases are irreversibly inactivated in chelator-treated serum.\n\nE.

Removal of $Ca^{2+}$ leads to the dissociation of $C1r$ and $C1s$ from $C1q$.\n2.  **Fact (ii):** The lectin pathway's initiator complex, Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), requires $Ca^{2+}$.\n3.  **Fact (iii):** The alternative pathway's $C3$ convertase, $C3bBb$, requires $Mg^{2+}$ for its formation and activity and is independent of $Ca^{2+}$.\n4.  **Fact (iv):** Ethylene Glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) is a chelator that selectively sequesters $Ca^{2+}$ with high affinity, leaving $Mg^{2+}$ available when $Mg^{2+}$ is present in excess.\n5.  **Experiment:** Normal human serum is treated with EGTA plus excess $Mg^{2+}$.\n6.  **Observation 1:** In an antibody-sensitized erythrocyte assay (classical pathway-dependent), lysis is markedly reduced.\n7.  **Observation 2:** In an assay selective for the alternative pathway, activity persists.\n8.  **Experiment 2:** $Ca^{2+}$ is added back to the EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$-treated serum.\n9.  **Observation 3:** Lysis in the antibody-sensitized erythrocyte assay is restored.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the givens.\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The facts presented are cornerstones of complement immunology. The cation dependencies of the three pathways are correctly described. The function of EGTA as a specific $Ca^{2+}$ chelator in the presence of $Mg^{2+}$ is accurately stated. The experimental approach (using chelators and specific hemolytic assays to dissect complement pathways) is a standard and valid technique. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness:** The provided facts and observations are mutually consistent. Fact (i) predicts the classical pathway should be inhibited by $Ca^{2+}$ removal. Fact (iv) states EGTA removes $Ca^{2+}$. Observation (1) confirms the classical pathway is inhibited. Fact (iii) predicts the alternative pathway should function with $Mg^{2+}$ and no $Ca^{2+}$. Fact (iv) and the experimental setup ensure these conditions. Observation (2) confirms the alternative pathway is active. The problem is self-contained and logically coherent.\n-   **Clarity and Objectivity:** The language is technical and precise. All terms are standard in the field of immunology. There is no ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. A solution may be derived.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to determine which complement pathways are active in serum treated with EGTA plus excess $Mg^{2+}$, and to explain the mechanism by which adding $Ca^{2+}$ restores classical pathway function.\n\n**Analysis of the EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$ Condition:**\nAccording to fact (iv), treating serum with EGTA plus excess $Mg^{2+}$ creates an environment where the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ is effectively zero, while the concentration of free $Mg^{2+}$ is sufficient for biological reactions. We analyze the status of each pathway under these conditions:\n\n1.  **Classical Pathway:** Fact (i) states that the assembly of the functional $C1$ complex ($C1qrs$) is strictly dependent on $Ca^{2+}$. In the absence of free $Ca^{2+}$, the $C1r_2s_2$ catalytic unit dissociates from the $C1q$ recognition molecule. The pathway cannot be initiated. Therefore, the classical pathway is **inactive**. This is consistent with observation (1).\n2.  **Lectin Pathway:** Fact (ii) states that the association of MASPs with MBL is also $Ca^{2+}$-dependent. By the same logic as the classical pathway, the absence of $Ca^{2+}$ prevents the formation of the functional MBL-MASP initiation complex. Therefore, the lectin pathway is also **inactive**.\n3.  **Alternative Pathway:** Fact (iii) states that the alternative pathway requires $Mg^{2+}$ for the assembly of its $C3$ convertase, $C3bBb$, and is independent of $Ca^{2+}$. Since the experimental medium contains sufficient free $Mg^{2+}$, the alternative pathway can proceed normally. Therefore, the alternative pathway is **active**. This is consistent with observation (2).\n\n**Conclusion for the first part:** In serum treated with EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$, only the alternative pathway remains active.\n\n**Analysis of $Ca^{2+}$ Reintroduction:**\nThe problem states that adding $Ca^{2+}$ back to the treated serum restores classical pathway-mediated lysis (observation 3).\n\n1.  When $Ca^{2+}$ is added, it will first bind to the EGTA. If added in sufficient quantity to overcome the chelation capacity of EGTA, the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ will rise.\n2.  With free $Ca^{2+}$ once again available, the condition for the assembly of the classical pathway's $C1$ complex (fact (i)) is met. The $C1r_2s_2$ unit re-associates with $C1q$.\n3.  Upon binding to an activator (antibody on erythrocytes), the now-functional $C1$ complex initiates the cascade by cleaving its substrates, $C4$ and $C2$.\n4.  The cleavage products $C4b$ and $C2a$ combine to form the classical pathway $C3$ convertase, $C4b2a$. This enzyme then drives the rest of the complement cascade, leading to cell lysis.\n\n**Conclusion for the second part:** Reintroduction of $Ca^{2+}$ restores classical pathway activity by allowing the reformation of the $Ca^{2+}$-dependent $C1$ complex, which is required to form the classical $C3$ convertase $C4b2a$.\n\n**Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Under EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$, only the alternative pathway remains active because $C3bBb$ assembly is $Mg^{2+}$-dependent and $Ca^{2+}$-independent; adding back $Ca^{2+}$ saturates EGTA and provides free $Ca^{2+}$ to stabilize the $C1q$–$C1r$–$C1s$ complex, enabling cleavage of $C4$ and $C2$ to form the classical $C3$ convertase $C4b2a$.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the derived conclusions. The first clause correctly identifies the active pathway and the reason for its activity. The second clause correctly describes the mechanism of classical pathway restoration: overcoming EGTA chelation to provide free $Ca^{2+}$, which enables the assembly of the $C1$ complex and subsequent formation of the $C4b2a$ convertase.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$, only the classical pathway remains active because $Mg^{2+}$ is sufficient for $C1$ function; adding back $Ca^{2+}$ primarily accelerates the alternative pathway by enhancing factor $D$ activity.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The classical pathway is inactive under these conditions, as it requires $Ca^{2+}$, not just $Mg^{2+}$ (contradicts fact (i)). Adding back $Ca^{2+}$ restores the classical pathway, not the alternative pathway, which is $Ca^{2+}$-independent (contradicts fact (iii) and observation (3)).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$, the lectin and alternative pathways remain active because both use $Mg^{2+}$; adding back $Ca^{2+}$ affects coagulation but not complement, so classical pathway activity is unchanged by $Ca^{2+}$ reintroduction.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The lectin pathway is inactive because it is $Ca^{2+}$-dependent (contradicts fact (ii)). The claim that adding back $Ca^{2+}$ does not change classical pathway activity is a direct contradiction of observation (3) and fact (i).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$, all complement pathways are inactivated because EGTA chelates both $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$; adding back $Ca^{2+}$ cannot restore activity because complement proteases are irreversibly inactivated in chelator-treated serum.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The alternative pathway remains active, as stated in the problem (observation 2) and predicted by the conditions (fact (iii) and fact (iv)). The claim that activity cannot be restored is a direct contradiction of observation (3). The dissociation of $C1$ components is a reversible, non-covalent interaction, not an irreversible inactivation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Under EGTA plus $Mg^{2+}$, the classical and lectin pathways remain active whereas the alternative pathway is blocked; adding back $Ca^{2+}$ restores the alternative pathway by promoting factor $B$ binding to $C3b$ to form $C3bB$.**\nThis statement presents a completely inverted scenario. The classical and lectin pathways are blocked, while the alternative pathway is active. Furthermore, restoration by $Ca^{2+}$ applies to the classical pathway, not the alternative pathway. Factor $B$ binding is $Mg^{2+}$-dependent, not $Ca^{2+}$-dependent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on rigorous analysis, only option A is consistent with all provided facts and observations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2897230"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple activation, the efficiency of the classical pathway is governed by subtle molecular details.

Start from the following foundational facts: in the classical complement pathway, the C1 complex binds to immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) on an antigenic surface, C1s cleaves C4 to C4b, and C4b exposes an internal thioester that can form a covalent bond with nearby nucleophiles on the target surface. It is well established that the C4A isotype preferentially forms amide linkages to amino groups, whereas the C4B isotype preferentially forms ester linkages to hydroxyl groups. Red blood cell (RBC) membranes present a glycocalyx rich in carbohydrate hydroxyl groups, along with membrane proteins that display amino groups.

The description of the classical complement pathway activation, the function of C4, the existence and differential reactivity of the C4A and C4B isotypes, the surface chemistry of erythrocytes, and the principle of the $CH_{50}$ assay are all factually correct and represent standard textbook knowledge.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem presents a well-defined comparison between two experimental conditions where a single variable (the C4 isotype) is altered. The initial conditions (equivalent total C4 and downstream components) are clearly stated, allowing for a logical deduction of the outcome based on the provided mechanisms. A unique, meaningful solution is derivable.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or non-scientific speculation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no logical contradictions, missing information, or pseudoscientific elements. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We may proceed to a solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe $CH_{50}$ assay measures the functional capacity of the complete classical complement cascade to induce cell lysis. The terminal event of lysis, mediated by the membrane attack complex (C5b-9), is contingent upon the successful and efficient execution of the initial steps. The critical step in question is the formation of the classical pathway C3 convertase, the enzyme complex C4b2a, on the surface of the target cell, which is here an $IgM$-sensitized sheep $RBC$.\n\nThe formation of the C3 convertase begins with the cleavage of C4 by activated C1s, generating C4b. This C4b fragment must then covalently attach to the target surface via its newly exposed internal thioester group. Without this covalent attachment, the C4b molecule diffuses away and is inactivated, and the cascade halts at this location. The efficiency of C4b deposition is therefore a primary determinant of the overall efficiency of the pathway.\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of C4A and C4B. Their functional difference lies in the reactivity of their thioester groups.\n*   **C4A** preferentially reacts with nucleophilic amino groups (-$NH_2$) to form stable **amide bonds**.\n*   **C4B** preferentially reacts with nucleophilic hydroxyl groups (-$OH$) to form less stable (but still effective) **ester bonds**.\n\nThe target surface is a sheep $RBC$. The problem states its surface chemistry consists of a \"glycocalyx rich in carbohydrate hydroxyl groups\" and \"membrane proteins that display amino groups\". The term \"rich\" indicates a high surface density of hydroxyl groups provided by the sugars of the glycocalyx. In contrast, while amino groups are present on proteins, the hydroxyl groups on carbohydrates are overwhelmingly more abundant on the cell surface.\n\nLet us analyze the two sera:\n\n1.  **Serum Y (containing only C4B):** When C4 is activated, the resulting C4b molecules encounter a surface dense with their preferred ligand, hydroxyl groups. C4B will thus bind efficiently and in large numbers to the $RBC$ glycocalyx, forming ester linkages. This high density of deposited C4b provides numerous stable platforms for the subsequent binding of C2 and formation of the C4b2a (C3 convertase) enzyme.\n\n2.  **Serum X (containing only C4A):** When C4 is activated, the resulting C4b molecules from the C4A isotype will preferentially seek amino groups for amide bond formation. As these are less abundant on the $RBC$ surface compared to the hydroxyl groups, the probability of a productive covalent attachment for any given C4A-derived C4b molecule is lower. Consequently, fewer C4b molecules will successfully opsonize the $RBC$ membrane per unit time.\n\n**Conclusion:** A higher efficiency of C4b deposition leads to a greater number of C3 convertase complexes. This, in turn, amplifies the cascade more robustly, leading to more C5 convertase formation, more membrane attack complex generation, and ultimately, a greater degree of hemolysis for a given concentration of serum. Therefore, Serum Y (C4B) is expected to mediate significantly more effective hemolysis than Serum X (C4A). Serum X will show reduced hemolysis relative to Serum Y.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Serum X will show reduced hemolysis compared to Serum Y, because C4B deposits more efficiently on hydroxyl-rich glycoconjugates via ester formation, favoring robust classical C3 convertase assembly on RBC membranes.**\n    This statement is in complete agreement with the derivation. It correctly predicts that Serum X (C4A) will be less lytic than Serum Y (C4B). The reasoning provided is precisely correct: C4B's preference for the abundant hydroxyl groups on the $RBC$ glycocalyx leads to more efficient deposition and subsequent C3 convertase assembly.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Serum X and Serum Y will show essentially identical hemolysis, because CH50 depends only on total C4 mass and not on C4 isotype composition when downstream components are normal.**\n    This premise is demonstrably false. The efficiency of the complement cascade is not merely a function of protein mass but of reaction kinetics and the probability of stable intermediate formation. The differential chemical reactivity of the C4A and C4B isotypes is a well-established factor that profoundly influences their function on different surfaces. Ignoring this difference is a critical error in reasoning.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Serum X will show increased hemolysis compared to Serum Y, because C4A preferentially reacts with amino groups on IgM or IgG near the activation site, thereby improving proximity-driven convertase formation on the RBC surface.**\n    This argument presents a plausible but less significant mechanism. While C4A can bind to amine groups on proteins, including the activating antibody, this is not the most efficient strategy for lysing the target cell. A convertase formed on the antibody is sterically hindered and further from the target membrane than a convertase formed directly on the cell surface. For effective lysis, the convertase must be anchored to the target membrane itself. The most efficient pathway will exploit the most abundant binding sites on the cell membrane, which are the hydroxyl groups targeted by C4B. This option incorrectly predicts the relative hemolysis.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Both sera will exhibit markedly impaired hemolysis, because C4A and C4B are functionally redundant in the classical pathway while hemolysis in this assay primarily requires Mannan-Binding Lectin-Associated Serine Protease two (MASP two) of the lectin pathway.**\n    This statement contains multiple fundamental errors. First, C4A and C4B are not functionally redundant; their distinct reactivities are the core of this problem. Second, the $CH_{50}$ assay is the canonical assay for the **classical pathway**, which is initiated by the C1 complex (C1q, C1r, C1s), not the lectin pathway. The lectin pathway is initiated by mannan-binding lectin ($MBL$) and its associated serine proteases ($MASPs$, including $MASP-2$). To claim the classical pathway assay requires a lectin pathway enzyme is a gross misunderstanding of complement biology and diagnostics.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2897223"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of the classical pathway is critical for clinical diagnostics.

It provides a classic clinical presentation and a corresponding, internally consistent set of immunological laboratory data. The values provided for $CH50$, $AH50$, $C3$, and $C4$ represent a specific, well-characterized pattern in clinical immunology that points to a narrow differential diagnosis. The task—to interpret the data, localize the defect, and determine the next diagnostic step—is a standard and formalizable exercise in medical reasoning based on established principles of the complement system. The problem contains no scientific fallacies, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to interpret the provided laboratory data according to the fundamental principles of the complement system's organization and function.\n\n1.  The Total Hemolytic Complement assay ($CH50$) measures the functional integrity of the entire classical pathway, from $C1$ to $C9$. A value of $10\\%$ demonstrates a severe defect or deficiency within this cascade.\n2.  The Alternative Pathway Hemolytic assay ($AH50$) measures the functional integrity of the alternative pathway (Factor $B$, Factor $D$, Properdin) and the common terminal pathway ($C5-C9$). A value of $95\\%$ of normal indicates that both the alternative and terminal pathways are intact and functional.\n3.  The combination of a profoundly low $CH50$ and a normal $AH50$ localizes the defect specifically to the early components of the classical pathway which are not shared with the alternative pathway. These components are $C1$ (a complex of $C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$), $C4$, and $C2$.\n4.  The serum $C4$ level is $2\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, which is significantly below the reference range of $10$–$40\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This confirms the involvement of the early classical pathway and indicates either a genetic deficiency of $C4$ or its active consumption.\n5.  The serum $C3$ level is $118\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, which is normal. This finding is critical. $C3$ is the substrate for the classical pathway $C3$-convertase, $C4b2a$. A normal $C3$ level in the presence of an extremely low $C4$ level suggests that the process depleting $C4$ is not leading to sustained, high-level formation of a stable $C3$-convertase, or that the primary pathology lies elsewhere.\n\nBased on these data, two primary hypotheses must be considered:\na) **Chronic consumption of $C4$**: This occurs when there is uncontrolled activation of $C1$. The primary regulator of $C1$ is the $C1$ esterase inhibitor ($C1$-INH). A deficiency in $C1$-INH function leads to spontaneous $C1$ activation, which in turn cleaves and consumes its substrates, $C4$ and $C2$. This results in very low $CH50$ and low $C4$ and $C2$ levels. The $C3$ level often remains normal, especially between attacks, because the primary pathology in $C1$-INH deficiency is driven by the overproduction of bradykinin, a separate pathway also regulated by $C1$-INH. The clinical history of trauma-induced angioedema is pathognomonic for this condition (Hereditary or Acquired Angioedema, HAE/AAE).\nb) **Genetic deficiency of $C4$**: A homozygous or severe partial deficiency of $C4$ genes ($C4A$ and $C4B$) would lead to low or absent $C4$ protein. This would result in a low $CH50$, normal $C3$, and normal $AH50$, which perfectly matches the laboratory profile.\n\nThe most logical next step is to perform tests that can differentiate between these two possibilities. This requires measuring the key proteins involved in the suspected consumption pathway: $C1$-INH level and function, and $C1q$ level. $C1q$ measurement distinguishes between hereditary angioedema (HAE, where $C1q$ is normal) and acquired angioedema (AAE, where $C1q$ is typically consumed and thus low). If these tests are normal, the diagnosis of a primary genetic $C4$ deficiency becomes the leading candidate.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The defect localizes to early classical pathway activation upstream of the $C3$ convertase with selective impact on $C4$; to distinguish consumption from genetic deficiency, measure C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) level and function and $C1q$: low $C1$-INH function with low or normal $C1q$ indicates consumption due to uncontrolled $C1$ activation (acquired: low $C1q$; hereditary: normal $C1q$), whereas normal $C1$-INH and $C1q$ with persistently absent $C4$ supports genetic $C4$ deficiency (optionally confirmed by $C4$ gene copy analysis) with normal $AH50$.**\nThis option correctly localizes the defect based on the lab data. It proposes the correct and most informative diagnostic tests ($C1$-INH level/function and $C1q$). The interpretation of the potential results to distinguish between HAE, AAE, and genetic $C4$ deficiency is comprehensive and accurate. The entire statement is logically and scientifically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The defect localizes to the alternative pathway at the level of factor $B$; confirm by measuring factor $B$ and properdin levels, which will be decreased in consumption but genetically absent in inherited factor $B$ deficiency, with $CH50$ remaining normal.**\nThis is incorrect. The localization to the alternative pathway is contradicted by the normal $AH50$ ($95\\%$ of normal). Furthermore, the problem states the $CH50$ is profoundly low, not normal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The defect localizes to the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC) components $C5$–$C9$; distinguish consumption from genetic deficiency by measuring soluble $C5b-9$ levels (increased if consumption), noting that genetic deficiency presents with normal $CH50$ and reduced $AH50$.**\nThis is incorrect. A defect in the terminal pathway ($C5-C9$) would impair both the classical and alternative pathways, leading to a low $CH50$ and a low $AH50$. The normal $AH50$ in the patient rules this out. The claim that genetic deficiency in this part of the pathway presents with a normal $CH50$ is factually wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The defect localizes to $C2$; confirm a genetic deficiency by finding persistently low $C2$ and low $C4$ with normal $C3$, and a normal $AH50$; consumption would instead lower both $CH50$ and $AH50$ equally.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple points. First, an isolated genetic deficiency of $C2$ does not cause consumption of $C4$; thus, $C4$ levels would be normal, which contradicts the data. Second, the claim that consumption lowers both $CH50$ and $AH50$ equally is a false generalization; the specific consumption mechanism in $C1$-INH deficiency selectively affects the classical pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The defect localizes to $C1q$, $C1r$, or $C1s$; distinguish consumption from genetic deficiency by measuring $C3$ breakdown products (elevated in consumption) because genetic deficiency of these proteins uniquely lowers $C4$ with normal $C3$ and preserves $AH50$.**\nThis is incorrect. The assertion that a genetic deficiency of $C1$ components \"uniquely lowers $C4$\" is fundamentally wrong. Without a functional $C1$ complex, $C4$ cannot be cleaved and would therefore be present at normal or elevated levels. This contradicts the patient's low $C4$ level. The proposed test is also less direct than measuring the components of the $C1$ complex and its inhibitor.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2897212"}]}
