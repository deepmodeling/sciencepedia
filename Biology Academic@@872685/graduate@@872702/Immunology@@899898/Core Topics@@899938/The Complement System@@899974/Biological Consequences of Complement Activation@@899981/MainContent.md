## Introduction
The complement system is a central pillar of [innate immunity](@entry_id:137209), a network of plasma proteins acting as a first line of defense against pathogens and a critical housekeeping system for clearing cellular debris. However, its power is a double-edged sword; while essential for host protection, its potent inflammatory and lytic capabilities can cause catastrophic tissue damage if left unchecked. This article delves into the biological consequences that unfold once this powerful cascade is triggered, addressing the fundamental question: What happens after complement is activated?

Across the following chapters, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the system's diverse effects. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will dissect the core enzymatic machinery that drives the cascade and explore the three cardinal effector pathways it unleashes: [opsonization](@entry_id:165670), inflammation, and cell lysis. "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will shift our focus to the real-world impact of complement, examining its central role in disease [pathogenesis](@entry_id:192966), its emergence as a major therapeutic target, and its surprising functions in fields like neurobiology and materials science. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will challenge you to apply this knowledge to interpret clinical data and devise therapeutic strategies. We begin by exploring the enzymatic engines at the heart of the system and the fundamental outcomes they orchestrate.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Following the initial recognition events that trigger the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways, the complement system converges upon a central enzymatic stage: the generation and amplification of C3 and C5 convertases. These enzymes are the engines that drive the system's diverse biological consequences. This chapter will dissect the principles and mechanisms governing the formation and function of these convertases, the three primary effector pathways they initiate—[opsonization](@entry_id:165670), inflammation, and lysis—and the intricate regulatory networks that focus these potent activities on appropriate targets while protecting the host.

### The Central Enzymatic Hub: C3 Convertases

At the heart of the complement cascade lies the **C3 convertase**, a [serine protease](@entry_id:178803) complex whose formation is the point of convergence for all three activation pathways. While the initiating stimuli differ, the outcome is the assembly of a proteolytic enzyme on a target surface.

The **classical pathway**, initiated by the binding of the C1 complex to clustered antibody Fc domains, and the **[lectin pathway](@entry_id:174287)**, initiated by the binding of [mannose-binding lectin](@entry_id:178609) (MBL) or ficolins to microbial [carbohydrates](@entry_id:146417), both generate the same C3 convertase. The activated proteases of these pathways—C1s and MASP-2, respectively—cleave C4 and C2. The larger C4b fragment covalently attaches to the target surface, where it binds the C2a fragment to form the **classical pathway C3 convertase, C4b2a**. [@problem_id:2836524]

The **alternative pathway** operates through a distinct mechanism. It is initiated by the spontaneous, low-level hydrolysis of C3 in plasma, yielding C3(H₂O), which can form a fluid-phase convertase. More importantly, any C3b generated by any pathway and deposited on a surface can initiate a powerful amplification loop. This surface-bound C3b binds plasma protein Factor B, which is then cleaved by Factor D to form the **alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb**. [@problem_id:2836524]

### The Amplification Engine: Kinetics and Positive Feedback

The biological potency of the complement system derives not simply from initiation, but from massive amplification. This is primarily the function of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, which establishes a powerful **[positive feedback loop](@entry_id:139630)**. The enzyme, C3bBb, has as its substrate C3, and its product is more C3b. Since C3b is a non-catalytic component of the enzyme itself, the production of more C3b leads to the formation of more C3bBb complexes, resulting in an exponential increase in C3 cleavage and C3b deposition on the target surface. [@problem_id:2836559]

The activity of these convertases is governed by their intrinsic stability. The classical convertase, **C4b2a**, is moderately stable, with an intrinsic half-life on a microbial surface of approximately 2 to 5 minutes at $37^{\circ}\text{C}$. In contrast, the alternative pathway convertase, **C3bBb**, is highly labile, with an intrinsic half-life of only 1 to 2 minutes. Its function is dramatically augmented by **[properdin](@entry_id:188527) (Factor P)**, a soluble positive regulator. Properdin binds to and stabilizes the C3bBb complex, extending its half-life by 5- to 10-fold, to approximately 10 minutes or more. This stabilization does not alter the enzyme's intrinsic catalytic rate but vastly increases the total number of C3 molecules it can cleave during its existence. For instance, a convertase cleaving 20 C3 molecules per minute would generate 20 C3b molecules in its 1-minute unsupported lifetime, but 200 C3b molecules when stabilized by [properdin](@entry_id:188527) for 10 minutes. This 10-fold increase in output per initiation event dramatically "steepens" the [positive feedback](@entry_id:173061), ensuring a rapid and overwhelming response on surfaces that permit it. [@problem_id:2836481] [@problem_id:2836559]

### The Primary Effector Functions

The cleavage of C3, and subsequently C5, unleashes the three cardinal biological consequences of [complement activation](@entry_id:197846): [opsonization](@entry_id:165670), inflammation, and lysis.

#### Opsonization and Phagocytic Clearance

**Opsonization** is the process of tagging a target, such as a bacterium, with host molecules (opsonins) to promote its recognition and engulfment by phagocytes. The primary complement opsonins are derivatives of C3. During activation, the nascent **C3b** fragment covalently attaches to microbial surfaces. This surface-bound C3b is itself an opsonin, recognized by **complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35)** on phagocytes.

However, the system features a sophisticated mechanism that couples regulation with a switch in opsonic function. The [serine protease](@entry_id:178803) **Factor I**, in the presence of a [cofactor](@entry_id:200224), cleaves C3b into **inactive C3b (iC3b)**. This single proteolytic event has a crucial dual consequence. First, it serves a regulatory role: iC3b can no longer bind Factor B, and thus cannot participate in forming C3 or C5 convertases. This cleavage permanently halts the amplification loop and prevents progression to the lytic pathway. [@problem_id:2836609]

Simultaneously, this cleavage enhances [opsonization](@entry_id:165670). While losing its convertase-forming ability, the surface-bound iC3b fragment exposes new protein structures (neoepitopes) that are recognized with high affinity by a different class of phagocyte receptors: **complement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18)** and **complement receptor 4 (CR4, CD11c/CD18)**. These integrin-family receptors are abundantly expressed on professional [phagocytes](@entry_id:199861) like [neutrophils](@entry_id:173698) and macrophages and are potent triggers for [phagocytosis](@entry_id:143316). Therefore, the conversion from C3b to iC3b acts as a [molecular switch](@entry_id:270567), turning off the inflammatory and lytic potential of the cascade while creating a superior tag for efficient and silent clearance of the target. [@problem_id:2836583] [@problem_id:2836609]

#### Inflammation and Chemoattraction via Anaphylatoxins

During the cleavage of C3 and C5 by their respective convertases, small soluble fragments are released: **C3a** and **C5a**. These peptides, known as **[anaphylatoxins](@entry_id:183599)**, are potent [inflammatory mediators](@entry_id:194567) that diffuse from the site of activation and act on specific G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) on various cell types. [@problem_id:2836538]

C3a binds to the **C3a receptor (C3aR)**, while C5a binds to two receptors, **C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1, CD88)** and **C5a receptor 2 (C5aR2)**. C5aR1 is the primary signaling receptor, a classic GPCR that, upon binding C5a, triggers potent pro-inflammatory responses. C5aR2, which lacks canonical G-protein coupling motifs, is thought to act as a decoy or modulatory receptor, shaping the C5a response.

The biological effects are profound. **C5a** is one of the most powerful chemoattractants for [neutrophils](@entry_id:173698), guiding them to sites of infection. Engagement of C5aR1 on [neutrophils](@entry_id:173698) triggers integrin activation for firm adhesion to the endothelium, [degranulation](@entry_id:197842) (release of antimicrobial contents), and the generation of a [reactive oxygen species](@entry_id:143670) (ROS) burst. Both C3a and C5a are potent activators of mast cells, causing the release of histamine and other vasoactive mediators that increase vascular permeability and contract smooth muscle. C5a also acts directly on [endothelial cells](@entry_id:262884), promoting the expression of adhesion molecules that facilitate leukocyte recruitment from the blood into tissues. [@problem_id:2836538]

#### Target Cell Lysis via the Membrane Attack Complex

The terminal event of the complement cascade is the formation of the **Membrane Attack Complex (MAC)**, a pore-forming structure that can lead to the osmotic lysis of target cells. This process is initiated when a C3 convertase binds an additional C3b molecule, changing its [substrate specificity](@entry_id:136373) to become a **C5 convertase** (e.g., C4b2a3b or C3bBb3b). The C5 convertase cleaves C5 into the C5a anaphylatoxin and the larger C5b fragment.

The assembly of the MAC is a highly orchestrated, sequential process, the biophysics of which can be understood by considering its reconstitution on a planar lipid bilayer. [@problem_id:2836573]
1.  **Initiation:** The newly generated **C5b** is conformationally unstable but is captured by **C6** to form a soluble, stable **C5b-6** complex.
2.  **Membrane Anchoring:** The C5b-6 complex binds **C7**. This induces a major conformational change in C7, exposing hydrophobic regions that insert into the lipid bilayer of the target membrane. This step firmly anchors the nascent complex to the surface.
3.  **Pore Nucleation:** The membrane-bound C5b-7 complex recruits **C8**. The C8β subunit binds to C5b, while its C8α-γ subunit inserts deeply into the membrane, creating a small, unstable pore. This nascent opening is energetically unfavorable due to the exposure of hydrophobic lipid acyl chains to the aqueous environment at the pore's edge, a phenomenon associated with high **interfacial [line tension](@entry_id:271657)**.
4.  **Pore Completion and Stabilization:** The C5b-8 complex serves as a nucleus for the binding and [polymerization](@entry_id:160290) of multiple (10-16) molecules of **C9**. The C9 monomers polymerize into a ring, forming a large, stable, transmembrane **[β-barrel](@entry_id:167313)**. This protein-lined channel replaces the high-energy lipid edge with a stable, hydrophilic [protein interface](@entry_id:194409), thereby eliminating the [line tension](@entry_id:271657) and creating a robust, water-filled channel with a diameter of approximately $10 \text{ nm}$. This stable pore allows for the unregulated passage of ions and small molecules, disrupting the cell's osmotic balance and leading to lysis. [@problem_id:2836573]

### Protecting the Host: The Regulatory Network

The immense power of the complement system necessitates a sophisticated network of regulatory proteins to prevent its accidental activation on host cells and to terminate the response once a threat is neutralized. These regulators act at every key stage of the cascade. [@problem_id:2836569]

-   **Initiation Control:** **C1 inhibitor (C1-INH)**, a serine [protease inhibitor](@entry_id:203600) (serpin), covalently traps and inactivates the C1r/C1s and MASP proteases, shutting down the classical and lectin pathways at their origin.

-   **C3 Convertase Control:** Host cell membranes display proteins that dismantle the C3 convertases. **Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF, CD55)** is a GPI-anchored protein that accelerates the [dissociation](@entry_id:144265) of both C4b2a and C3bBb by displacing the catalytic C2a or Bb subunits. Other regulators, termed **[cofactors](@entry_id:137503)**, facilitate the permanent inactivation of C3b and C4b by the plasma protease **Factor I**. **Membrane Cofactor Protein (MCP, CD46)** is a [transmembrane protein](@entry_id:176217) that serves as a cofactor for Factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b deposited on host cells.

-   **Alternative Pathway Discrimination:** The soluble regulator **Factor H (FH)** is central to discriminating "self" from "non-self". Host cells are decorated with polyanionic molecules like sialic acids and [glycosaminoglycans](@entry_id:173906). Factor H possesses binding sites for both C3b and these polyanions. This dual recognition allows Factor H to bind with high avidity specifically to host surfaces where C3b has been deposited. Once concentrated on a host surface, Factor H exerts its two regulatory functions: it accelerates the decay of any C3bBb convertase and acts as a [cofactor](@entry_id:200224) for Factor I to permanently inactivate C3b. On a typical microbial surface lacking these polyanions, Factor H binds only weakly to C3b and cannot effectively control amplification. This mechanism elegantly ensures that the powerful alternative pathway loop is directed against microbes while being suppressed on host tissues. [@problem_id:2836577] [@problem_id:2836569]

-   **Terminal Pathway Control:** Host cells express **CD59 (Protectin)**, a GPI-anchored protein that binds to the C5b-8 complex and physically blocks the recruitment and [polymerization](@entry_id:160290) of C9. This directly prevents the formation of the lytic MAC pore, providing a final line of defense against complement-mediated self-damage. [@problem_id:2836569]

### Bridging Innate and Adaptive Immunity

Beyond its direct [effector functions](@entry_id:193819), the [complement system](@entry_id:142643) serves as a critical bridge to the adaptive immune system, particularly in shaping the B cell response. This link is mediated by the final degradation product of C3b, the **C3d** fragment.

Following cleavage of C3b to iC3b, further [proteolysis](@entry_id:163670) can generate C3d, which remains covalently attached to the antigen. B cells express a **co-receptor complex** consisting of **complement receptor 2 (CR2, CD21)**, which is the receptor for C3d, along with the signaling molecule **CD19** and the tetraspanin **CD81**. When a B cell encounters an antigen that has been tagged with C3d, that antigen can simultaneously engage the B cell receptor (BCR) and the CR2 co-receptor. [@problem_id:2836591]

This **co-ligation** dramatically lowers the threshold for B cell activation. The clustering of the co-receptor with the BCR brings CD19 into proximity with the BCR-associated Src-family kinase Lyn. Lyn phosphorylates the cytoplasmic tail of CD19, creating a docking site for [phosphoinositide 3-kinase](@entry_id:202373) (PI3K). The recruited PI3K generates high local concentrations of the lipid second messenger PIP₃, which in turn facilitates the recruitment and activation of downstream kinases like BTK and the enzyme PLCγ2. The result is a much stronger intracellular signal for a given amount of antigen, effectively amplifying the activation signal by orders of magnitude. [@problem_id:2836591]

Furthermore, **Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs)** in lymph node germinal centers use their own surface CR2 to trap and display C3d-tagged antigens. This creates a durable reservoir of antigen that is available for B cells to survey, sustaining the [germinal center reaction](@entry_id:192028) and facilitating the selection of high-affinity B cells. In this way, complement not only flags pathogens for immediate destruction but also ensures a robust and high-quality [adaptive memory](@entry_id:634358) response is generated. [@problem_id:2836591]
