It is a standard exercise in biophysical modeling. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Fractional Receptor Occupancy $\\theta(L)$**\nWe start from the given definitions:\n1.  The dissociation constant: $K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$\n2.  The mass balance for the total receptor: $[R]_T = [R] + [RL]$\n\nFrom the mass balance equation (2), we express the concentration of free receptor $[R]$ as:\n$$ [R] = [R]_T - [RL] $$\nSubstitute this expression for $[R]$ into the definition of the dissociation constant (1), and representing the constant free ligand concentration $[L]$ as $L$:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{([R]_T - [RL]) L}{[RL]} $$\nOur objective is to find an expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta(L) = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$. To achieve this, we must first solve for $[RL]$ in terms of $[R]_T$, $L$, and $K_D$.\n$$ K_D [RL] = ([R]_T - [RL]) L = [R]_T L - [RL] L $$\nRearrange the terms to group all terms containing $[RL]$:\n$$ K_D [RL] + [RL] L = [R]_T L $$\n$$ [RL] (K_D + L) = [R]_T L $$\nSolving for the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex $[RL]$ yields:\n$$ [RL] = \\frac{[R]_T L}{K_D + L} $$\nNow, we can find the fractional occupancy $\\theta(L)$ by dividing by the total receptor concentration $[R]_T$:\n$$ \\theta(L) = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{1}{[R]_T} \\left( \\frac{[R]_T L}{K_D + L} \\right) $$\n$$ \\theta(L) = \\frac{L}{K_D + L} $$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Normalized Activation $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}}$**\nThe normalized activation $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}}$ is stated to follow a Hill-type dependence on $L$. The general form of the Hill equation is:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{L^n}{K_A^n + L^n} $$\nwhere $K_A$ is the ligand concentration that produces a half-maximal response ($\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{2}$) and $n$ is the Hill coefficient.\n\nThe problem specifies that half-maximal activation occurs at the ligand concentration, which we will denote $L_{1/2}$, that yields half-occupancy ($\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$). We use the expression for $\\theta(L)$ derived in Part 1 to find this concentration:\n$$ \\theta(L_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{L_{1/2}}{K_D + L_{1/2}} $$\nSolving for $L_{1/2}$:\n$$ K_D + L_{1/2} = 2 L_{1/2} $$\n$$ K_D = L_{1/2} $$\nThis result shows that the ligand concentration yielding half-occupancy is equal to the dissociation constant $K_D$. According to the problem's assumption, this is also the concentration for half-maximal activation. Therefore, the parameter $K_A$ in the Hill equation is equal to $K_D$.\nSubstituting $K_A = K_D$ into the generic Hill equation gives the specific expression for normalized activation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{L^n}{K_D^n + L^n} $$\nThis is the required expression for normalized activation as a function of $L$, $K_D$, and $n$.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Normalized Activation**\nWe are given the following values:\n- $L = 1.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_D = 0.45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $n = 3$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}}$. The units $(\\mu\\mathrm{M})$ are consistent and will cancel. It is more efficient to first compute the ratio $\\frac{K_D}{L}$ and then substitute it into an equivalent form of the Hill equation.\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{L^n}{K_D^n + L^n} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D^n}{L^n} + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{K_D}{L}\\right)^n + 1} $$\nFirst, calculate the ratio $\\frac{K_D}{L}$ as an exact fraction:\n$$ \\frac{K_D}{L} = \\frac{0.45}{1.2} = \\frac{45}{120} = \\frac{3 \\times 15}{8 \\times 15} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nNow substitute this ratio and $n=3$ into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^3 + 1} $$\nCalculate the cubic term:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^3 = \\frac{3^3}{8^3} = \\frac{27}{512} $$\nSubstitute this result back into the expression:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{27}{512} + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{27}{512} + \\frac{512}{512}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{27 + 512}{512}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{539}{512}} $$\nThe final result for the normalized activation is:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{512}{539} $$\nThe numbers $512=2^9$ and $539=7^2 \\times 11$ share no common prime factors, so this fraction is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{512}{539}}$$", "id": "2906218"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of γδ T cell function is their ability to integrate signals from multiple receptors, not just the T cell receptor (TCR).

A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the frequency (probability estimate, $p_i$) for each clonotype at each time point. The richness, or number of clonotypes, is $S=5$.\n\nFor Day $0$, the total count is $N_0 = 20+18+17+15+10 = 80$. The frequencies are:\n$p_{1,0} = 20/80 = 0.25$\n$p_{2,0} = 18/80 = 0.225$\n$p_{3,0} = 17/80 = 0.2125$\n$p_{4,0} = 15/80 = 0.1875$\n$p_{5,0} = 10/80 = 0.125$\nThe sum is $\\sum p_{i,0} = 1.0$.\n\nFor Day $7$, the total count is $N_7 = 50+10+8+6+6 = 80$. The frequencies are:\n$p_{1,7} = 50/80 = 0.625$\n$p_{2,7} = 10/80 = 0.125$\n$p_{3,7} = 8/80 = 0.1$\n$p_{4,7} = 6/80 = 0.075$\n$p_{5,7} = 6/80 = 0.075$\nThe sum is $\\sum p_{i,7} = 1.0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the required metrics for each time point. We will use the natural logarithm (base $e$) for entropy calculations, as is standard.\n\n**(i) Shannon Entropy and Simpson Concentration**\n\n**Shannon Entropy ($H$)**: The formula is $H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i)$.\nFor Day $0$:\n$$H_0 = -(0.25 \\ln(0.25) + 0.225 \\ln(0.225) + 0.2125 \\ln(0.2125) + 0.1875 \\ln(0.1875) + 0.125 \\ln(0.125))$$\n$$H_0 \\approx -(-0.3466 - 0.3356 - 0.3291 - 0.3139 - 0.2599) \\approx 1.5851$$\nFor Day $7$:\n$$H_7 = -(0.625 \\ln(0.625) + 0.125 \\ln(0.125) + 0.1 \\ln(0.1) + 2 \\times 0.075 \\ln(0.075))$$\n$$H_7 \\approx -(-0.2938 - 0.2599 - 0.2303 - 0.3885) \\approx 1.1725$$\nComparing the two, $H_7 < H_0$.

The maximum entropy $H_{max}$ for richness $S=5$ is $H_{max} = \\ln(S) = \\ln(5) \\approx 1.6094$.\nFor Day $0$:\n$$C_{P,0} = 1 - \\frac{H_0}{H_{max}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1.5851}{1.6094} \\approx 1 - 0.9849 \\approx 0.0151$$\nTo two decimal places, $C_{P,0} \\approx 0.02$.\nFor Day $7$:\n$$C_{P,7} = 1 - \\frac{H_7}{H_{max}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1.1725}{1.6094} \\approx 1 - 0.7285 \\approx 0.2715$$\nTo two decimal places, $C_{P,7} \\approx 0.27$.\nThe Pielou-normalized clonality rises from approximately $0.02$ to $0.27$.\n\n**(iii) Immunological Interpretation**\n\nThe data show that at Day $0$, the top $5$ clonotypes have relatively similar frequencies, resulting in a high Shannon entropy ($H_0 \\approx 1.59$, close to the maximum possible $H_{max} \\approx 1.61$), a low Simpson concentration ($D_0 \\approx 0.21$), and a consequently low clonality ($C_{P,0} \\approx 0.02$). This describes a relatively even or polyclonal repertoire.\n\nBy Day $7$, after the phosphoantigen challenge, the frequency distribution has dramatically shifted. Clonotype $C_1$ has expanded from $25\\%$ to $62.5\\%$ of the population, while all other clonotypes have decreased in relative frequency. This is a classic signature of antigen-driven clonal selection and expansion. This increased dominance of a single clone is quantitatively captured by a decrease in Shannon entropy ($H_7 \\approx 1.17$), an increase in Simpson concentration ($D_7 \\approx 0.43$), and a marked rise in clonality ($C_{P,7} \\approx 0.27$). This response is precisely what is expected for phosphoantigen-responsive V$\\gamma$9V$\\delta$2 T cells.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Shannon entropy decreases; Simpson concentration increases; Pielou-normalized clonality rises from about $0.02$ to about $0.27$.

Interpretation: clonal dominance lessens after challenge because the diversity index is smaller.**\n- The direction of change for entropy and concentration is correct.\n- The stated clonality values are incorrect. They appear to be derived from the Simpson diversity index ($1-D$), which is not the metric defined in the problem. $1-D_0 \\approx 1 - 0.209 = 0.791$ and $1-D_7 \\approx 1 - 0.428 = 0.572$.
