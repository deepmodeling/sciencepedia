It contains no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the fractional occupancy, $f$, as a function of ligand concentration, $L$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{D}$. We begin with the provided definitions.\n\nThe total receptor concentration is given by the conservation equation:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = R + RL$$\nFrom this, we express the free receptor concentration, $R$, in terms of the total and bound receptor concentrations:\n$$R = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - RL$$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant:\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{R \\cdot L}{RL}$$\nSubstitute the expression for $R$ into the $K_{D}$ equation:\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{(R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - RL) \\cdot L}{RL}$$\nOur goal is to solve for the quantity $RL$. We rearrange the equation algebraically.\n$$K_{D} \\cdot RL = (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - RL) \\cdot L$$\n$$K_{D} \\cdot RL = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot L - RL \\cdot L$$\nGroup the terms containing $RL$:\n$$K_{D} \\cdot RL + RL \\cdot L = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot L$$\n$$RL \\cdot (K_{D} + L) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot L$$\nIsolating $RL$ yields the concentration of the bound receptor complex:\n$$RL = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot L}{K_{D} + L}$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are ligand-bound, $f = \\frac{RL}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$. Substituting the expression for $RL$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot L}{K_{D} + L} \\right)$$\nThe $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ terms cancel, giving the final expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$f(L) = \\frac{L}{K_{D} + L}$$\nThis is the standard form of the Langmuir isotherm, also known as the Hill equation with a Hill coefficient of $n=1$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the fractional occupancies in the interstitium ($f_{\\mathrm{int}}$) and the sinus ($f_{\\mathrm{sin}}$), and their difference, $\\Delta f$. We are given $K_{D} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $L_{\\mathrm{int}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, and $L_{\\mathrm{sin}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nThe fractional occupancy in the interstitium is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{int}} = f(L_{\\mathrm{int}}) = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{int}}}{K_{D} + L_{\\mathrm{int}}} = \\frac{2}{5 + 2} = \\frac{2}{7}$$\nThe fractional occupancy in the sinus is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{sin}} = f(L_{\\mathrm{sin}}) = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{sin}}}{K_{D} + L_{\\mathrm{sin}}} = \\frac{200}{5 + 200} = \\frac{200}{205} = \\frac{40}{41}$$\nThe difference in fractional occupancy is therefore:\n$$\\Delta f = f_{\\mathrm{sin}} - f_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{40}{41} - \\frac{2}{7}$$\nTo compute the exact value, we find a common denominator, which is $41 \\times 7 = 287$:\n$$\\Delta f = \\frac{40 \\cdot 7}{41 \\cdot 7} - \\frac{2 \\cdot 41}{7 \\cdot 41} = \\frac{280}{287} - \\frac{82}{287} = \\frac{280 - 82}{287} = \\frac{198}{287}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives approximately $0.68989547...$. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta f \\approx 0.6899$$\n\nThe final task is to assess the biological plausibility of this signal. Chemotaxis, or directed cell migration along a chemical gradient, relies on the cell's ability to sense a spatial difference in chemoattractant concentration across its own dimensions. For a GPCR-based system, this primary signal is the differential in receptor occupancy between the \"front\" and \"back\" of the cell. The calculated $\\Delta f \\approx 0.69$ represents the change in average occupancy upon moving from a low-concentration environment to a high-concentration one. This is a very large change, from about $29\\%$ occupancy ($2/7$) to over $97\\%$ occupancy ($40/41$).\n\nThe sensitivity of a receptor system to changes in ligand concentration is greatest when the ambient concentration is near the $K_{D}$. The interstitial concentration, $L_{\\mathrm{int}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, is near the $K_D$ of $5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, placing the lymphocyte in a highly sensitive regime where small changes in S1P concentration lead to significant changes in receptor occupancy. The transition to the sinus ($L_{\\mathrm{sin}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{nM} \\gg K_D$) drives the system toward saturation. The magnitude of the change in fractional occupancy, $\\Delta f$, is substantial. Biological systems have evolved to detect much smaller differences in receptor occupancy across a cell, often on the order of just a few percent, and then amplify this small initial asymmetry into a robust polarization and migration response. A signal of the magnitude calculated here is therefore overwhelmingly strong and is unquestionably sufficient to drive a powerful and directed chemotactic response, dictating egress into the lymphatic sinus.\n\nThe primary caveats in this simplified analysis, which the problem statement correctly identifies as assumptions, are the neglect of receptor desensitization, internalization, and downstream signal adaptation. These are crucial negative feedback mechanisms that prevent overstimulation and allow cells to reset their sensitivity and respond to subsequent gradients. However, for the initial decision to cross a boundary defined by a $100$-fold concentration change, the initial occupancy signal is the key trigger, and its magnitude as calculated is a valid indicator of a powerful migratory cue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6899}$$", "id": "2891122"}, {"introduction": "A lymphocyte's decision to exit a lymph node is not solely dependent on the external S1P gradient; it is also tightly controlled by the cell's internal state.

Applying this to the governing equation gives:\n$$\n0 = P - k_{e,0} M_{0} - \\delta M_{0}\n$$\nwhere $k_{e,0}$ is the baseline egress rate constant.\nThe egress rate is defined as the flux $E = k_{e} M$.
