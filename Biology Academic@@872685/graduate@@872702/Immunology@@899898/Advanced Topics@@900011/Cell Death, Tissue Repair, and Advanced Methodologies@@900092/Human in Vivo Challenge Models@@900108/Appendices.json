Investigators must synthesize knowledge of pathogen biology, transmission routes, clinical care, and statistical principles to formulate a viable study protocol. This exercise [@problem_id:2854516] simulates this high-level design process, challenging you to select the most appropriate integrated study plan for a comparative trial by evaluating critical factors such as participant screening, pathogen-specific containment measures, and the statistical adequacy of the proposed sample size.", "problem": "A team plans a comparative Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) study to interrogate early innate immune signatures after exposure to two different pathogens: Influenza A virus and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The primary scientific goal is to obtain comparable early-timepoint innate signatures in blood within the first $72$ hours after challenge. The team must satisfy three constraints derived from first principles and well-tested facts:\n\n- For inference on early innate responses, individuals must have similar probabilities of becoming infected after a standardized exposure. The infection outcome under a fixed exposure when volunteers are independent can be modeled as a sequence of Bernoulli trials with a common success probability equal to the attack rate, and the number of infected individuals then follows a binomial distribution.\n\n- For ethical safety and public-health protection, respiratory-aerosol transmissible pathogens require inpatient isolation with engineering controls, whereas strictly fecal–oral pathogens can be managed with strict hygiene and activity restrictions without necessarily requiring respiratory isolation. Rescue therapy must be available and initiated per a prespecified clinical trigger to cap risk and disease duration.\n\n- To enable the primary endpoint, the study must enroll a sufficient number of participants per cohort so that the probability of observing at least $15$ infected individuals in each cohort is at least $0.95$, given the expected attack rates under standardized challenge and appropriate screening for pre-existing immunity. Based on historical challenge data, the team anticipates an attack rate of approximately $0.60$ for Influenza A in seronegative individuals and approximately $0.55$ for Salmonella Typhi in typhoid-naive individuals at the planned challenge doses.\n\nAdditional well-established considerations apply: Influenza A challenge is typically delivered intranasally; Salmonella Typhi challenge is delivered orally in buffer. To standardize immune susceptibility, participants with pre-existing immunity that would substantially lower attack rates (for example, a hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titer of at least $1\\!:\\!40$ for the homologous Influenza A antigen or prior typhoid vaccination within the past few years) should be excluded.\n\nWhich of the following integrated designs best satisfies these scientific and ethical constraints?\n\nA. Enroll only Influenza A seronegative volunteers with HAI titers below $1\\!:\\!40$ and typhoid-naive volunteers; isolate both cohorts as inpatients for $10$ days; use intranasal influenza and oral Salmonella Typhi inocula; plan neuraminidase inhibitor and antibiotic rescue per prespecified triggers; enroll $n = 20$ per cohort.\n\nB. Enroll volunteers regardless of prior influenza or typhoid vaccination; conduct all procedures outpatient without isolation; deliver influenza intranasally and Salmonella Typhi intradermally to reduce gastrointestinal risk; treat only if severe disease occurs; enroll $n = 15$ per cohort.\n\nC. Enroll Influenza A seronegative volunteers with HAI titers below $1\\!:\\!40$ and typhoid-naive volunteers; isolate the influenza cohort in negative-pressure inpatient rooms until shedding cessation criteria or day $10$ while managing the typhoid cohort outpatient with strict hygiene and activity restrictions; deliver influenza intranasally and Salmonella Typhi orally in buffer; initiate neuraminidase inhibitor and antibiotic rescue per prespecified clinical triggers; enroll $n = 32$ for influenza and $n = 36$ for typhoid to ensure at least $15$ infected per cohort with probability at least $0.95$.\n\nD. Enroll volunteers vaccinated against both influenza and typhoid within the past $1$ year to reduce risk; expose the influenza cohort by aerosol in an open-ward environment to mimic natural transmission; deliver Salmonella Typhi orally; defer rescue therapy unless severe criteria are met; enroll $n = 60$ per cohort; allow participants to return home daily between visits.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "We begin from definitions and well-tested facts relevant to controlled human infection studies.\n\nFirst, when volunteers are exposed independently to a standardized inoculum, the infection outcome for each individual can be modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with success probability equal to the attack rate, denoted $p$. Under independence and identical exposure, the number of infected individuals $X$ in a cohort of size $n$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$. The requirement that the probability of observing at least $15$ infected individuals is at least $0.95$ can be written as $\\Pr(X \\ge 15) \\ge 0.95$. This benchmark must be evaluated for each pathogen using its expected attack rate under the planned inclusion criteria and challenge.\n\nSecond, respiratory pathogens such as Influenza A are transmissible via aerosols and droplets, implicating risk to contacts and staff; thus, ethical and public-health safeguards require inpatient isolation with appropriate engineering controls (for example, negative-pressure rooms) until transmission risk is acceptably low (for example, per prespecified shedding cessation criteria or a maximum duration such as day $10$). In contrast, Salmonella Typhi is transmitted via the fecal–oral route; while it requires careful management to prevent environmental contamination and secondary cases, respiratory isolation is not required. Outpatient management with strict hygiene measures, activity restrictions (for example, no food handling), daily monitoring, and prompt antibiotic rescue is the standard risk-mitigation approach.\n\nThird, to harmonize infection risk across individuals and cohorts, volunteers with substantial pre-existing immunity that would reduce the attack rate should be excluded. For Influenza A, a hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titer of at least $1\\!:\\!40$ for the homologous strain is a common threshold associated with reduced risk; thus, including only seronegative or low-titer individuals (HAI below $1\\!:\\!40$) increases the likelihood of infection at a given challenge dose. For Salmonella Typhi, prior typhoid vaccination can reduce susceptibility and alter attack rates; thus, including typhoid-naive participants is appropriate.\n\nWe now determine the minimal sample sizes that meet the probability threshold using the binomial model. For Influenza A with anticipated attack rate $p = 0.60$, we seek $n$ satisfying $\\Pr(X \\ge 15) \\ge 0.95$ for $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, 0.60)$. Using a normal approximation with continuity correction, $X$ is approximated by a normal random variable with mean $\\mu = np$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = \\sqrt{np(1-p)} = \\sqrt{n \\cdot 0.60 \\cdot 0.40} = \\sqrt{0.24 n}$. The condition $\\Pr(X \\ge 15) \\ge 0.95$ is equivalent to $\\Pr(X \\le 14) \\le 0.05$. Applying the continuity correction at $14.5$ and the $5\\%$ lower-tail quantile $z_{0.05} \\approx -1.645$, we require\n$$(14.5 - \\mu)/\\sigma \\le -1.645.$$\nEquivalently,\n$$\\mu - 14.5 \\ge 1.645 \\,\\sigma.$$\nSubstituting $\\mu = 0.60 n$ and $\\sigma = \\sqrt{0.24 n}$ gives\n$$0.60 n - 14.5 \\ge 1.645 \\sqrt{0.24 n}.$$\nLetting $t = \\sqrt{n}$ converts this to a quadratic in $t$:\n$$0.60 t^{2} - 14.5 \\ge 1.645 \\sqrt{0.24}\\, t.$$\nWith $\\sqrt{0.24} \\approx 0.4899$, the right-hand side is approximately $0.8055 \\, t$. Solving $0.60 t^{2} - 0.8055 t - 14.5 = 0$ for $t$ yields the positive root\n$$t = \\frac{0.8055 + \\sqrt{0.8055^{2} + 4 \\cdot 0.60 \\cdot 14.5}}{2 \\cdot 0.60} \\approx \\frac{0.8055 + 5.956}{1.20} \\approx 5.6346,$$\nso $n = t^{2} \\approx 31.7$. Rounding up to the nearest integer yields $n = 32$.\n\nFor Salmonella Typhi with anticipated attack rate $p = 0.55$, we repeat the calculation. Here $\\mu = 0.55 n$ and $\\sigma = \\sqrt{0.55 \\cdot 0.45 \\cdot n} = \\sqrt{0.2475 n}$, and the same inequality with continuity correction becomes\n$$0.55 n - 14.5 \\ge 1.645 \\sqrt{0.2475 n}.$$\nSetting $t = \\sqrt{n}$ again and noting $\\sqrt{0.2475} \\approx 0.4975$ yields\n$$0.55 t^{2} - 14.5 \\ge 1.645 \\cdot 0.4975 \\, t \\approx 0.818 \\, t.$$\nSolving $0.55 t^{2} - 0.818 t - 14.5 = 0$ gives\n$$t = \\frac{0.818 + \\sqrt{0.818^{2} + 4 \\cdot 0.55 \\cdot 14.5}}{2 \\cdot 0.55} \\approx \\frac{0.818 + 5.711}{1.10} \\approx 5.935,$$\nso $n = t^{2} \\approx 35.2$. Rounding up yields $n = 36$.\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nOption A: This option correctly screens for pre-existing immunity (HAI below $1\\!:\\!40$ for influenza and typhoid-naive), uses appropriate inoculation routes (intranasal for influenza, oral for Salmonella Typhi), and includes prespecified rescue therapies. It applies inpatient isolation to both cohorts; while not unsafe, respiratory isolation is unnecessary for strictly fecal–oral Salmonella Typhi, which can be managed with outpatient strict hygiene. Critically, the proposed sample size $n = 20$ per cohort fails the binomial requirement. For influenza with $p = 0.60$, the expected number infected would be $0.60 \\cdot 20 = 12$, making $\\Pr(X \\ge 15)$ substantially below $0.95$. Thus, Option A does not satisfy the required probability constraint. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption B: This option enrolls volunteers regardless of prior vaccination, which undermines the aim of comparable and sufficiently high attack rates; pre-existing immunity would reduce and heterogenize susceptibility. It provides no isolation for a respiratory pathogen, creating undue public-health risk. It proposes intradermal inoculation for Salmonella Typhi, which is not the established oral challenge route. The sample size $n = 15$ is too small to achieve the required probability of at least $15$ infections. Rescue therapy is deferred to severe disease only, which is ethically suboptimal. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C: This option screens for pre-existing immunity appropriately (HAI below $1\\!:\\!40$ and typhoid-naive), applies pathogen-appropriate transmission containment (negative-pressure inpatient isolation for the influenza cohort until shedding cessation or day $10$; outpatient management with strict hygiene and activity restrictions for the typhoid cohort), uses the correct inoculation routes (intranasal for influenza, oral buffered for Salmonella Typhi), and prespecifies timely rescue therapies. The sample sizes $n = 32$ for influenza and $n = 36$ for typhoid are exactly those derived from the binomial requirement to achieve $\\Pr(X \\ge 15) \\ge 0.95$ given the anticipated attack rates of $0.60$ and $0.55$, respectively. This design satisfies all stated scientific and ethical constraints. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption D: Although a larger sample size $n = 60$ might satisfy the binomial requirement, this option intentionally enrolls recently vaccinated volunteers, which will depress attack rates and compromise the primary objective of comparable early innate signatures at a given dose. It proposes aerosol exposure in an open ward for influenza, which is inappropriate and increases transmission risk to the community. It allows participants to leave daily, further increasing risk. Rescue therapy is deferred to severe disease only, which is ethically inferior. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best option is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2854516"}, {"introduction": "The statistical power of a clinical trial is its ability to detect a true effect, and this depends heavily on the sample size.

Let us formalize this.\nThe probability of an event from any cause occurring in the infinitesimal interval $[t, t+\\mathrm{d}t)$, given survival up to time $t$, is $h(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.\nThe probability of an event specifically caused by the challenge agent in the same interval is $h_c(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.\nThe probability of an event specifically caused by the background process in the same interval is $h_b(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.\n\nThe posterior probability of challenge-related causation, which we shall denote as $\\pi_{c}(t)$, given that an event occurred at time $t$, is the ratio of the rate of challenge-caused events to the rate of total events at that instant.\n$$ \\pi_{c}(t) = \\frac{P(\\text{event in } [t, t+\\mathrm{d}t) \\text{ is from cause } c)}{P(\\text{event in } [t, t+\\mathrm{d}t) \\text{ from any cause})} = \\frac{h_{c}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t}{h(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{h_{c}(t)}{h_{c}(t) + h_{b}(t)} $$\nSubstituting the given functional forms for the hazard rates:\n$$ \\pi_{c}(t) = \\frac{\\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t)}{\\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) + \\lambda_{b}} $$\nThe Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) requires this probability to be at least $q$. This gives the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t)}{\\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) + \\lambda_{b}} \\ge q $$\nWe must solve this inequality for $t$. Since all parameters $\\alpha, \\beta, \\lambda_b$ are positive, and the exponential function is positive, the denominator is always positive. We can multiply both sides by the denominator without altering the direction of the inequality.\n$$ \\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\ge q (\\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) + \\lambda_{b}) $$\n$$ \\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\ge q \\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) + q \\lambda_{b} $$\nGroup the terms containing $\\exp(-\\alpha t)$:\n$$ \\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) - q \\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\ge q \\lambda_{b} $$\n$$ (1-q) \\beta \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\ge q \\lambda_{b} $$\nGiven that $0 < q < 1$, the term $(1-q)$ is positive. The parameter $\\beta$ is also positive. We can therefore divide by $(1-q)\\beta$.\n$$ \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\ge \\frac{q \\lambda_{b}}{(1-q)\\beta} $$\nTo solve for $t$, we apply the natural logarithm, which is a monotonically increasing function, to both sides. This preserves the inequality. The argument of the logarithm is positive as all constituent parameters are positive.\n$$ \\ln(\\exp(-\\alpha t)) \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{q \\lambda_{b}}{(1-q)\\beta}\\right) $$\n$$ -\\alpha t \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{q \\lambda_{b}}{(1-q)\\beta}\\right) $$\nFinally, we divide by $-\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, $-\\alpha$ is negative, which requires reversing the direction of the inequality.\n$$ t \\le -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{q \\lambda_{b}}{(1-q)\\beta}\\right) $$\nUsing the property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, this can be written more cleanly as:\n$$ t \\le \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1-q)\\beta}{q \\lambda_{b}}\\right) $$\nThis inequality defines the window of time for which the condition is met. The latest time, $t^{\\ast}$, is the maximum value of $t$ that satisfies this condition.\n$$ t^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1-q)\\beta}{q \\lambda_{b}}\\right) $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $t^{\\ast}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $t^{\\ast}$ using the provided numerical values:\n$\\alpha = 0.05~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$\\beta = 0.05~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$\\lambda_{b} = 0.0005~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$q = 0.9$\n\nFirst, compute the argument of the logarithm:\n$$ \\frac{(1-q)\\beta}{q \\lambda_{b}} = \\frac{(1 - 0.9) \\times 0.05}{0.9 \\times 0.0005} = \\frac{0.1 \\times 0.05}{0.00045} = \\frac{0.005}{0.00045} = \\frac{50}{4.5} = \\frac{100}{9} $$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$ t^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{0.05} \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{9}\\right) $$\n$$ t^{\\ast} = 20 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{9}\\right) $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{9}\\right) \\approx 2.4079456 $$\n$$ t^{\\ast} \\approx 20 \\times 2.4079456 \\approx 48.158912~\\mathrm{h} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ t^{\\ast} \\approx 48.16~\\mathrm{h} $$\nThis is the latest time in hours at which a first febrile event can be observed and still have a posterior probability of being challenge-related of at least $90\\%$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{48.16}$$", "id": "2854504"}]}
