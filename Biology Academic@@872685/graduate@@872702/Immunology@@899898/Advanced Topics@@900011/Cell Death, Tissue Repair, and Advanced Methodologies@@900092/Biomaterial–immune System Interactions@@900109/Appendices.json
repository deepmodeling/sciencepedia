It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of competitive Langmuir adsorption, a fundamental concept in surface science and biomaterial interactions. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective to derive a unique steady-state solution. The language is objective and precise. The physical parameters are realistic. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe kinetics of the adsorption-desorption process for the two competing proteins, $A$ and $B$, on a surface with a fixed number of sites can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Let $\\theta_A(t)$ and $\\theta_B(t)$ be the fractional surface coverages of proteins $A$ and $B$ at time $t$, respectively. The fraction of unoccupied sites is then $\\theta_E(t) = 1 - \\theta_A(t) - \\theta_B(t)$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass-action, the rate of adsorption is proportional to the bulk concentration of the protein and the fraction of available sites. The rate of desorption is proportional to the fraction of sites already occupied by that protein.\n\nFor protein $A$, the rate of change of its fractional coverage is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = (\\text{rate of adsorption of } A) - (\\text{rate of desorption of } A)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = k_{\\text{on},A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{\\text{off},A} \\theta_A\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for protein $B$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = (\\text{rate of adsorption of } B) - (\\text{rate of desorption of } B)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = k_{\\text{on},B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{\\text{off},B} \\theta_B\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state coverages. At steady state, the net rate of change of coverage for each species is zero. This means we set the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nThis yields a system of two algebraic equations:\n1. $k_{\\text{on},A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{\\text{off},A} \\theta_A = 0$\n2. $k_{\\text{on},B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{\\text{off},B} \\theta_B = 0$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ in terms of the fraction of empty sites, $(1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)$:\nFrom (1):\n$$\nk_{\\text{on},A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) = k_{\\text{off},A} \\theta_A \\implies \\theta_A = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\nFrom (2):\n$$\nk_{\\text{on},B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) = k_{\\text{off},B} \\theta_B \\implies \\theta_B = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\n\nIt is convenient to define the equilibrium association constant, $K_{A,i}$, for each protein $i \\in \\{A, B\\}$ as the ratio of its on-rate to its off-rate constant:\n$$\nK_{A,i} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},i}}{k_{\\text{off},i}}\n$$\nThis constant quantifies the binding affinity of the protein for the surface. The equations become:\n$$\n\\theta_A = K_{A,A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = K_{A,B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\n\nThe total fractional coverage is $\\theta_A + \\theta_B$. We can substitute the expressions above:\n$$\n\\theta_A + \\theta_B = K_{A,A} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) + K_{A,B} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_A + \\theta_B = (K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B)(1 - (\\theta_A + \\theta_B))\n$$\n\nLet $S = \\theta_A + \\theta_B$. The equation is $S = (K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B)(1-S)$. Solving for $S$:\n$$\nS(1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B) = K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B\n$$\n$$\nS = \\frac{K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}\n$$\nThis is the total fractional coverage. To find the individual coverages, we substitute the expression for the fraction of empty sites, $1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B = 1 - S$, back into the equations for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$.\n$$\n1 - S = 1 - \\frac{K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}\n$$\nTherefore, the final expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ are:\n$$\n\\theta_A = K_{A,A} C_A (1 - S) = \\frac{K_{A,A} C_A}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = K_{A,B} C_B (1 - S) = \\frac{K_{A,B} C_B}{1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B}\n$$\nExpressed in terms of the original rate constants, these are:\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right) C_A}{1 + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right) C_A + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}}\\right) C_B}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}}\\right) C_B}{1 + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}}\\right) C_A + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}}\\right) C_B}\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate these expressions numerically. First, we compute the dimensionless quantities $K_{A,i}C_i$:\nFor protein $A$:\n$$\nK_{A,A} C_A = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},A}}{k_{\\text{off},A}} C_A = \\frac{10^{5}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}}{10^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = (10^{7}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{M}) = 500\n$$\nFor protein $B$:\n$$\nK_{A,B} C_B = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},B}}{k_{\\text{off},B}} C_B = \\frac{10^{4}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}}{10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = (10^{8}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = 100\n$$\nThe common denominator is:\n$$\nD = 1 + K_{A,A} C_A + K_{A,B} C_B = 1 + 500 + 100 = 601\n$$\nNow, we calculate the fractional coverages:\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\frac{500}{601} \\approx 0.8319467...\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = \\frac{100}{601} \\approx 0.1663893...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required:\n$$\n\\theta_A \\approx 0.832\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B \\approx 0.166\n$$\n\nInterpretation:\nThe numerical results show that $\\theta_A \\approx 0.832$ and $\\theta_B \\approx 0.166$. Since $\\theta_A > \\theta_B$, protein $A$ is the dominant component of the protein corona at steady state. The reason for this dominance is found in the derived quantities that determine surface occupancy. The steady-state partitioning of proteins onto the surface is governed by the competition parameter, which is the product of the protein's association constant (affinity) and its bulk concentration, $K_{A,i}C_i$. We calculated $K_{A,A}C_A = 500$ and $K_{A,B}C_B = 100$. Protein $A$ dominates because its competition parameter is five times larger than that of protein $B$ ($500/100 = 5$). It is instructive to note that protein $B$ has a higher intrinsic affinity for the surface ($K_{A,B} = 10^8\\,\\text{M}^{-1}$) compared to protein $A$ ($K_{A,A} = 10^7\\,\\text{M}^{-1}$). However, the much higher concentration of protein $A$ ($C_A = 50 \\times C_B$) more than compensates for its lower affinity, leading to its prevalence on the surface at equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.832 & 0.166 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2837015"}, {"introduction": "A crucial factor determining the immune response to particulate biomaterials is their physical size, which influences whether they are successfully engulfed by phagocytes or trigger frustrated, pro-inflammatory responses.

The assumptions are explicitly listed.\n\nThe normal distribution model for a physical diameter $D$ implies a non-zero probability for $D < 0$, which is physically impossible. We must check if this idealization is acceptable. The probability of a non-physical diameter is $P(D \\le 0)$. Standardizing, this corresponds to $P(Z \\le \\frac{0 - 15}{5}) = P(Z \\le -3) \\approx 0.00135$. This probability is extremely small, and therefore the normal distribution serves as a valid and computationally convenient approximation for the true (likely truncated) distribution of particle diameters in this regime.

According to the problem statement, this event occurs when a particle's diameter $D$ exceeds the critical length scale $L_c$.
