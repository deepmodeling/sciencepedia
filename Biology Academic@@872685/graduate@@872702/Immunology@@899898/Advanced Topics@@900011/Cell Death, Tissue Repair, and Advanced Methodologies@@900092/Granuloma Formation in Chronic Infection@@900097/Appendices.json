Consider a simplified but mechanistically grounded scenario: due to rare, independent antigen processing and loading events, the number of cognate peptide–MHC complexes displayed on an individual macrophage surface during a brief contact window follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = 10$. A T lymphocyte bearing the appropriate T cell receptor (TCR) is modeled to exhibit a threshold activation response: it activates if and only if it encounters at least $T^{\\ast} = 5$ cognate peptide–MHC complexes on the contacted macrophage during the interaction window. Assume that each T cell–macrophage encounter samples a single macrophage drawn at random from the population, and that the number of cognate complexes per macrophage is independent across cells.\n\nStarting from the definition of the Poisson probability mass function and the indicator model of threshold activation, derive an expression for the expected activation probability of a single T cell upon a single macrophage encounter in this granuloma context, and evaluate it for $\\lambda = 10$ and $T^{\\ast} = 5$.

It is scientifically grounded in immunological modeling, well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and objectively formulated. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or logical flaws. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the probability of T cell activation. Let $N$ be the random variable representing the number of cognate peptide–MHC complexes on the surface of a single macrophage. According to the problem statement, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean value $\\lambda$. The probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer representing the number of events. The problem provides the mean of this distribution as $\\lambda = 10$.\n\nT lymphocyte activation is described by a threshold model. Activation occurs if and only if the number of complexes $N$ encountered by the T cell is at least a threshold value $T^{\\ast}$. The specified threshold is $T^{\\ast} = 5$. Therefore, the T cell activation event corresponds to the condition $N \\ge T^{\\ast}$, which is $N \\ge 5$.\n\nThe expected activation probability is the probability of this event, $P(N \\ge 5)$. It is more convenient to calculate this probability using the complement rule. The complement event is that the number of complexes is less than the threshold, i.e., $N < 5$. The probability of activation is thus:\n$$P(N \\ge 5) = 1 - P(N < 5)$$\nThe probability $P(N < 5)$ is the sum of the probabilities for $N$ taking on the discrete values $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$.\n$$P(N < 5) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} P(N=k) = P(N=0) + P(N=1) + P(N=2) + P(N=3) + P(N=4)$$\nUsing the Poisson PMF with $\\lambda = 10$, we can write this sum as:\n$$P(N < 5) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\frac{10^k \\exp(-10)}{k!} = \\exp(-10) \\left( \\frac{10^0}{0!} + \\frac{10^1}{1!} + \\frac{10^2}{2!} + \\frac{10^3}{3!} + \\frac{10^4}{4!} \\right)$$\nWe evaluate each term in the summation:\n*   For $k=0$: $\\frac{10^0}{0!} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$\n*   For $k=1$: $\\frac{10^1}{1!} = \\frac{10}{1} = 10$\n*   For $k=2$: $\\frac{10^2}{2!} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50$\n*   For $k=3$: $\\frac{10^3}{3!} = \\frac{1000}{6}$\n*   For $k=4$: $\\frac{10^4}{4!} = \\frac{10000}{24} = \\frac{1250}{3}$\nSumming these terms:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\frac{10^k}{k!} = 1 + 10 + 50 + \\frac{1000}{6} + \\frac{10000}{24} = 61 + \\frac{500}{3} + \\frac{1250}{3} = 61 + \\frac{1750}{3} = \\frac{183 + 1750}{3} = \\frac{1933}{3} $$\nNow, we substitute this sum back into the expression for $P(N < 5)$:\n$$P(N < 5) = \\exp(-10) \\left( \\frac{1933}{3} \\right)$$\nNumerically, $\\frac{1933}{3} \\approx 644.3333$.

It provides a specific experimental setup, a set of fundamental principles, and asks for a prediction of the combined outcome across several defined readouts. It is solvable through logical deduction from the provided premises.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or other flaws that would invalidate it. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem asks to predict the outcome of a specific immunological experiment based on fundamental principles. Let us analyze the consequences of the experimental setup step-by-step.\n\n1.  **T Cell Priming**: Naive CD4 T cells are primed primarily by DCs in the lung-draining lymph nodes. The problem states that DCs retain MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$ expression. This is because conventional DCs are derived from both the WT CD$45.1$ donor marrow and the CD$45.2$ donor marrow, and the LysM-Cre driver is inefficient in DCs. Therefore, DCs can effectively take up Mtb antigens, process them, and present peptides on MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$ to prime naive CD4 T cells. The generation and expansion of Mtb-specific effector CD4 T cells are expected to be normal.\n\n2.  **Effector T Cell Function in the Granuloma**: After priming, effector CD4 T cells migrate to the lungs to participate in granuloma formation and control the infection. Inside the granuloma, the macrophage population is a $50$:$50$ mosaic of WT (MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$-sufficient) and knockout (KO, MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$-deficient) cells. Mtb is an intracellular pathogen that primarily resides within macrophages.\n    - **Principle 1 & 2**: According to these principles, effector CD4 T cells exert their function (e.g., IFN-$\\gamma$ delivery) upon recognizing specific Mtb peptides presented on MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$ molecules on the surface of an infected cell.\n    - **Interaction with WT Macrophages**: WT macrophages (CD$45.1^+$) can present Mtb antigens on MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$. Thus, Mtb-specific CD4 T cells will form stable, cognate interactions with infected WT macrophages. This leads to targeted delivery of effector cytokines like IFN-$\\gamma$.\n    - **Interaction with KO Macrophages**: KO macrophages (CD$45.2^+$) are genetically incapable of expressing MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$. Even if infected, they cannot present Mtb antigens to CD4 T cells. Consequently, Mtb-specific CD4 T cells will not form stable cognate interactions with them. This directly impacts readout (ii): the frequency and dwell time of CD4 T cell contacts will be significantly lower for KO macrophages compared to WT macrophages.\n\n3.  **Macrophage Activation and Pathogen Control**:\n    - **Principle 3**: IFN-$\\gamma$ is crucial for activating macrophages to kill intracellular Mtb, partly through the upregulation of iNOS.\n    - **Principle 4**: Cytokine effects are local. The concentration of IFN-$\\gamma$ is highest at the immunological synapse formed between the T cell and its target and decreases with distance.\n    - **iNOS expression (readout iii)**: Due to the stable cognate interaction, WT macrophages receive a high, localized dose of IFN-$\\gamma$ from CD4 T cells, leading to strong iNOS upregulation. KO macrophages, lacking this specific interaction, must rely on \"bystander\" IFN-$\\gamma$ that diffuses from nearby T cells interacting with WT macrophages or DCs. Due to the fall-off in concentration with distance (Principle 4), this bystander signal will be weaker and less reliable. Therefore, iNOS expression will be selectively lower in the KO macrophage population.\n    - **Bacterial Burden (readout iv)**: Since iNOS-dependent killing mechanisms are sub-optimally activated in KO macrophages, their ability to control Mtb replication will be impaired. This predicts that the CFU count per sorted KO macrophage will be higher than in sorted WT macrophages. The failure to control the pathogen in a substantial fraction ($\\sim50\\%$) of the host macrophages will lead to an overall increase in the total bacterial burden in the lungs compared to a control scenario where all macrophages are WT.\n\n4.  **Granuloma Architecture (readout i)**: Granulomas are organized structures that depend on coordinated cellular interactions to contain infection. Productive CD4 T cell-macrophage interactions are central to this organization. The inability of CD4 T cells to properly engage and activate approximately half of the infected macrophages will disrupt this architecture, leading to a more disorganized structure. Increased bacterial load and macrophage death often lead to the development of central necrosis and attract an influx of neutrophils, which can exacerbate tissue damage. A disorganized, less effective immune response is therefore associated with increased pathology, not reduced immunopathology.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Granulomas remain well organized with normal CD4 T cell cuffing because DC priming is intact; bystander IFN-$\\gamma$ fully compensates at the infection site, yielding comparable iNOS, equal CFU between macrophage genotypes, and unchanged total lung CFU.**\nThis option is incorrect. While DC priming is intact, this option erroneously assumes that bystander IFN-$\\gamma$ fully compensates for the lack of cognate interaction at the effector site. This contradicts Principle 2 (need for cognate interaction for effector function) and Principle 4 (cytokine gradients), which together imply that local, directed cytokine delivery is far more efficient than bystander effects. Thus, iNOS and CFU would not be comparable between genotypes, and total lung CFU would be expected to increase due to impaired overall control. **Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Granulomas become more disorganized with reduced CD4 T cell retention around MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$-deficient macrophages; iNOS is selectively lower in MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$-deficient macrophages; CFU are higher in the MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$-deficient macrophage subset and total lung CFU increase relative to fully wild-type controls, with more neutrophil-rich necrotic cores.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our derivation. It correctly predicts: ($1$) reduced CD4 T cell interaction with KO macrophages and resulting granuloma disorganization; ($2$) lower iNOS in KO macrophages due to lack of direct help; ($3$) higher bacterial burden within KO macrophages as a consequence; ($4$) an increase in total lung CFU due to overall reduced host control; and ($5$) a plausible pathological consequence of increased necrosis and neutrophil influx. **Correct.**\n\n**C. Loss of MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$ on macrophages primarily disrupts CD8 T cell cytotoxicity, decreasing tissue damage; reduced immunopathology improves containment, lowering total lung CFU despite unchanged iNOS.**\nThis option is incorrect. It misidentifies the primary T cell population affected. The genetic defect is in MHC class $\\mathrm{II}$, which interacts with CD4 T cells, not MHC class $\\mathrm{I}$, which interacts with CD8 T cells (Principle 5). The premise that disrupting the immune response improves pathogen containment and lowers CFU is counterintuitive and contrary to the principles of host defense. The claim of unchanged iNOS is also incorrect. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Reduced antigen presentation by macrophages decreases local immunopathology, allowing tighter granuloma organization with smaller necrotic cores; bystander IFN-$\\gamma$ from CD4 T cells fully activates macrophages of both genotypes, decreasing CFU in all macrophages and reducing total lung CFU.**\nThis option is incorrect. It incorrectly posits that reduced antigen presentation is beneficial and leads to \"tighter\" organization and better control. Impaired macrophage activation leads to worse, not better, pathogen control and typically more, not less, pathology. Like option A, it relies on the flawed premise that bystander activation is fully compensatory. The predicted outcomes are the opposite of what is logically expected. **Incorrect.**\n\n**E. There is no change in CFU partitioning between macrophage genotypes because DCs compensate; however, enhanced DC antigen presentation skews responses toward T follicular helper cells, increasing B cell aggregates while leaving granuloma structure and total lung CFU unchanged.**\nThis option is incorrect. The premise that DCs can fully compensate for the presentation defect of macrophages *at the effector site* is flawed. DCs and macrophages have distinct primary roles and locations. There is no basis given to assume DC presentation is \"enhanced\" or that the response would specifically skew to T follicular helper cells, which are mainly involved in germinal centers, not granulomas. The prediction of no change in CFU partitioning or total CFU contradicts the expected consequences of impaired macrophage activation. **Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2851355"}, {"introduction": "The granuloma is not merely a static structure but a dynamic battlefield where the pathogen attempts to replicate and spread.

This value is a product of two key quantities: first, the average total number of bacteria released by the primary infected macrophage during its lifetime, and second, the probability that any single one of these bacteria successfully infects a new susceptible macrophage.\n\nLet us formalize this. We define $R_0$ as:\n$$\nR_0 = (\\text{Expected total bacteria released}) \\times (\\text{Probability of a single bacterium causing infection})\n$$\nLet $E[N_B]$ be the expected total number of bacteria released, and let $P_{\\text{infect}}$ be the probability of a single bacterium causing a successful infection. Then, the basic reproduction number is given by:\n$$\nR_0 = E[N_B] \\cdot P_{\\text{infect}}\n$$\nWe must now derive expressions for these two components based on the given parameters.\n\nFirst, we determine $P_{\\text{infect}}$. An extracellular bacterium is subject to two competing, memoryless stochastic events:\n$1$. Uptake by a susceptible macrophage, which is the event that leads to a new infection. This occurs with a rate of $\\beta M$.\n$2$. Extracellular clearance, which removes the bacterium without infection. This occurs with a rate of $\\mu$.\n\nThese competing events can be modeled as two independent exponential \"clocks.\" The time to uptake, $T_{\\text{uptake}}$, is an exponential random variable with rate $\\beta M$. The time to clearance, $T_{\\text{clearance}}$, is an exponential random variable with rate $\\mu$. A new infection occurs if the uptake event happens before the clearance event ($T_{\\text{uptake}} < T_{\\text{clearance}}$). The problem provides the rule for such a scenario: the probability that the event with rate $\\lambda_1$ occurs before the event with rate $\\lambda_2$ is $\\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2}$. Applying this rule with $\\lambda_1 = \\beta M$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\mu$, we find the probability of successful infection for a single bacterium:\n$$\nP_{\\text{infect}} = \\frac{\\beta M}{\\beta M + \\mu}\n$$\nThis term represents the fraction of released bacteria that are expected to successfully cause a new infection.\n\nSecond, we determine $E[N_B]$, the expected total number of bacteria released by the initial infected macrophage. The macrophage's lifetime, $T$, is a random variable following an exponential distribution with a constant death rate $\\delta$, written as $T \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\delta)$. The problem states that the mean of such a distribution is $E[T] = \\frac{1}{\\delta}$.\n\nDuring its lifetime $T$, the macrophage releases bacteria at a constant rate $r$. The problem states that for a random lifetime $T$, this process yields a number of bacteria $N_B$ whose conditioned expectation is $E[N_B | T] = rT$. To find the unconditional expectation $E[N_B]$, we must average this quantity over the distribution of all possible lifetimes $T$. This is accomplished using the law of total expectation:\n$$\nE[N_B] = E[E[N_B|T]] = E[rT]\n$$\nSince expectation is a linear operator, we can write:\n$$\nE[N_B] = r \\cdot E[T]\n$$\nSubstituting the mean lifetime $E[T] = \\frac{1}{\\delta}$, we obtain the expected total number of bacteria released:\n$$\nE[N_B] = r \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\delta} = \\frac{r}{\\delta}\n$$\n\nFinally, we combine the two derived components to obtain the expression for $R_0$:\n$$\nR_0 = E[N_B] \\cdot P_{\\text{infect}} = \\left(\\frac{r}{\\delta}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\beta M}{\\beta M + \\mu}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this product gives the final analytical expression for the basic reproduction number:\n$$\nR_0 = \\frac{r \\beta M}{\\delta (\\beta M + \\mu)}\n$$\nThis formula provides a clear, mechanistic interpretation: $R_0$ is the product of the rate of pathogen production ($r$), the average duration of infectiousness ($1/\\delta$), and the probability that a produced pathogen successfully transmits the infection to a new host cell ($\\frac{\\beta M}{\\beta M + \\mu}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{r \\beta M}{\\delta (\\beta M + \\mu)}}\n$$", "id": "2851354"}]}
