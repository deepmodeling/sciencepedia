It is not trivial, as it requires a derivation from first principles. It is not metaphorical, contradictory, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the fractional occupancy of Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptors from first principles.\n\nThe system describes a reversible, single-site binding equilibrium between a free ligand $L$ (PD-L1), a free receptor $R$ (PD-1), and the ligand-receptor complex $LR$:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons LR\n$$\nThe law of mass action applied to this system at equilibrium gives the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[LR]}\n$$\nHere, $[R]$ and $[L]$ are the concentrations of the free receptor and free ligand at equilibrium, respectively, and $[LR]$ is the concentration of the bound complex.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of free receptors and bound receptors:\n$$\n[R]_T = [R] + [LR]\n$$\nThe objective is to find the fractional occupancy, $f$, defined as:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_T}\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[LR]$ from the equations. First, we rearrange the definition of $K_D$ to express the free receptor concentration $[R]$ in terms of other quantities:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_D [LR]}{[L]}\n$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the total receptor concentration:\n$$\n[R]_T = \\frac{K_D [LR]}{[L]} + [LR]\n$$\nFactoring out the term $[LR]$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n[R]_T = [LR] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1 \\right)\n$$\nTo find the fractional occupancy $f$, we rearrange this equation to form the ratio $\\frac{[LR]}{[R]_T}$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1}\n$$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the fractional occupancy derived from first principles. This is a specific form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site ($n=1$). It is important to note that the problem gives the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, $[L]$. A common scenario involves knowing the total ligand concentration, $[L]_T$. In such cases, one must typically invoke the approximation $[L] \\approx [L]_T$, which is valid if the total receptor concentration is much smaller than the total ligand concentration ($[R]_T \\ll [L]_T$), preventing significant ligand depletion. However, the problem statement provides $[L]$ directly, rendering this approximation unnecessary for the calculation phase.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $f$ using the provided data:\n- $[L] = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $K_D = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nf = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{10}{11}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\nf \\approx 0.909090... \\approx 0.9091\n$$\nThus, approximately $90.91\\%$ of the PD-1 receptors on the T cells are occupied by PD-L1 at steady state.\n\nFinally, a brief interpretation is required. A high receptor occupancy of approximately $91\\%$ ensures potent recruitment of the phosphatase SHP-2 to the phosphorylated ITIM and ITSM domains of PD-1. This recruitment leads to strong dephosphorylation and attenuation of key signaling molecules in the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 pathways, thereby inhibiting T cell activation and promoting an exhausted phenotype.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9091}\n$$", "id": "2903028"}, {"introduction": "Tumors are not monolithic entities but rather heterogeneous populations of cells that evolve under selective pressure from the immune system.

The simplifying assumptions of linear scaling are acceptable for a theoretical model problem. We will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the fold-change in CD8$^{+}$ T-cell recognition efficacy, denoted $E/E_{0}$, for a tumor with intratumoral heterogeneity in B2M expression, relative to a reference tumor that is uniformly B2M-sufficient.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between the HLA-I surface density, $D(f)$, and the fractional B2M level, $f$. The problem states a linear proportionality:\n$$D(f) \\propto f$$\nThis can be expressed as an equation, $D(f) = k f$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. We are given that a fully competent clone, for which $f=1$, has an HLA-I density of $D_0$. We use this to determine the constant $k$:\n$$D(f=1) = D_0 = k \\cdot 1 \\implies k = D_0$$\nTherefore, the model for HLA-I density on a cell with a fractional B2M level $f$ is:\n$$D(f) = D_0 f$$\n\nNext, we must determine the tumor-wide mean HLA-I density per cell, which we shall denote as $\\bar{D}$.

Subclone 3 (biallelic loss): fraction $x_3 = 0.25$, fractional B2M level $f_3 = 0$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for $\\bar{D}$:\n$$\\bar{D} = D_0 \\left( (0.25 \\cdot 1.0) + (0.50 \\cdot 0.40) + (0.25 \\cdot 0) \\right)$$\n$$\\bar{D} = D_0 (0.25 + 0.20 + 0)$$\n$$\\bar{D} = 0.45 D_0$$\n\nThe problem states that the CD8$^{+}$ T-cell recognition efficacy, $E$, is directly proportional to this mean HLA-I density, $\\bar{D}$. So, for the heterogeneous tumor:\n$$E \\propto \\bar{D} \\implies E = C \\cdot \\bar{D} = C (0.45 D_0)$$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nFor the reference case of a uniformly B2M-sufficient tumor, all cells are of the wild-type ($f=1.0$).
