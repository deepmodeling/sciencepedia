All are $\\ge 0.85$. This panel qualifies.\nThe sensitivities are $0.776, 0.64, 0.69375$. The minimum sensitivity is $0.64$.\n**Verdict for D:** This option is a valid candidate.\n\n**Final Comparison and Selection**\nWe must now apply the selection criterion to the qualifying options: B, C, and D.\n\n1. **Specificity $\\ge 0.85$**: All three options (B, C, D) satisfy this condition. Option A is eliminated.\n2. **Maximize Minimum Sensitivity**: We compare the minimum sensitivity for each valid option.\n   - Option B: $\\min(S_{\\text{BC}}, S_{\\text{GBM}}, S_{\\text{NSCLC}}) = \\min(0.544, 0.24, 0.39375) = 0.24$.\n   - Option C: $\\min(S_{\\text{BC}}, S_{\\text{GBM}}, S_{\\text{NSCLC}}) = \\min(0.7, 0.3, 0.6) = 0.3$.\n   - Option D: $\\min(S_{\\text{BC}}, S_{\\text{GBM}}, S_{\\text{NSCLC}}) = \\min(0.776, 0.64, 0.69375) = 0.64$.\n\nThe minimum sensitivities are $0.24$ for B, $0.3$ for C, and $0.64$ for D. Option D has the highest minimum sensitivity ($0.64 > 0.3 > 0.24$).\n\n3. **Tie-breaker**: There is no tie. Option D is unambiguously selected by the second criterion. The number of markers does not need to be considered.\n\nTherefore, Option D provides the best balance of specificity and worst-case sensitivity across the given tumor types according to the specified criteria.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n- Option A is incorrect because its specificity is too low.\n- Option B is incorrect because its minimum sensitivity ($0.24$) is suboptimal.\n- Option C is incorrect because its minimum sensitivity ($0.3$) is suboptimal.\n- Option D is correct because it satisfies the specificity threshold and has the highest minimum sensitivity ($0.64$) among all valid options.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2903567"}]}
