Consider a source population in which T1D has prevalence $K = 0.005$.

The provided data ($K$, $p_{\\text{case}}$, $p_{\\text{control}}$) are within a plausible range for such a genetic association. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient data and standard epidemiological assumptions (HWE, rare disease approximation, multiplicative model) to allow for a unique, computable solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of two quantities: the allelic odds ratio and the population attributable fraction.\n\n**Part 1: Allelic Odds Ratio ($OR_{\\text{allele}}$)**\n\nThe odds of an allele being HLA-DQ8 among cases is the ratio of the frequency of the DQ8 allele to the frequency of non-DQ8 alleles:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{case}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{case}}}{1 - p_{\\text{case}}} $$\nSubstituting the given value $p_{\\text{case}} = 0.45$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{case}} = \\frac{0.45}{1 - 0.45} = \\frac{0.45}{0.55} = \\frac{9}{11} $$\nThe odds of an allele being HLA-DQ8 among controls is:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{control}}}{1 - p_{\\text{control}}} $$\nSubstituting the given value $p_{\\text{control}} = 0.15$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{0.15}{1 - 0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{3}{17} $$\nThe allelic odds ratio, $OR_{\\text{allele}}$, is the ratio of these odds:\n$$ OR_{\\text{allele}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{case}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{control}}} = \\frac{9/11}{3/17} = \\frac{9}{11} \\times \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3 \\times 17}{11} = \\frac{51}{11} $$\nNumerically, this is $OR_{\\text{allele}} \\approx 4.63636...$.\n\n**Part 2: Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)**\n\nThe population attributable fraction (PAF) measures the proportion of disease incidence in a population that is due to a specific exposure. The exposure is defined as carrying at least one HLA-DQ8 allele. We must derive this from first principles.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the HLA-DQ8 allele in the population, which we estimate from the controls: $p = p_{\\text{control}} = 0.15$. The frequency of the non-DQ8 allele is $q = 1 - p = 0.85$.\nUnder the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the population, the genotype frequencies for individuals with $0$, $1$, or $2$ copies of the HLA-DQ8 allele are:\n- $f_0$ (non-carrier, non-DQ8/non-DQ8): $f_0 = q^2 = (0.85)^2 = 0.7225$.\n- $f_1$ (heterozygote, DQ8/non-DQ8): $f_1 = 2pq = 2(0.15)(0.85) = 0.255$.\n- $f_2$ (homozygote, DQ8/DQ8): $f_2 = p^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225$.\n\nLet $R_0$, $R_1$, and $R_2$ be the disease risks (probabilities) for individuals with $0$, $1$, and $2$ DQ8 alleles, respectively. The multiplicative model on log-odds and the rare disease approximation ($OR \\approx RR$) imply the following relationships for risk ratios relative to non-carriers:\n- Risk ratio for heterozygotes: $RR_1 = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} \\approx OR_{\\text{het}} = OR_{\\text{allele}} = \\frac{51}{11}$.\n- Risk ratio for homozygotes: $RR_2 = \\frac{R_2}{R_0} \\approx OR_{\\text{hom}} = (OR_{\\text{allele}})^2 = \\left(\\frac{51}{11}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2601}{121}$.\n\nThe PAF is the fraction of total cases that would be prevented if the exposure (carrying at least one DQ8 allele) were eliminated. The total number of cases in a population of size $N$ is proportional to the overall risk $P(D) = f_0 R_0 + f_1 R_1 + f_2 R_2$. The number of cases attributable to the exposure is proportional to $(R_1 - R_0)f_1 + (R_2 - R_0)f_2$.\nTherefore, the PAF is:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{(R_1 - R_0)f_1 + (R_2 - R_0)f_2}{f_0 R_0 + f_1 R_1 + f_2 R_2} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by the baseline risk $R_0$:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{(\\frac{R_1}{R_0} - 1)f_1 + (\\frac{R_2}{R_0} - 1)f_2}{f_0 + (\\frac{R_1}{R_0})f_1 + (\\frac{R_2}{R_0})f_2} = \\frac{(RR_1 - 1)f_1 + (RR_2 - 1)f_2}{f_0 + RR_1 f_1 + RR_2 f_2} $$\nNow we substitute the numerical values:\n- $f_0 = 0.7225$\n- $f_1 = 0.255$\n- $f_2 = 0.0225$\n- $RR_1 = \\frac{51}{11} \\approx 4.63636$\n- $RR_2 = \\frac{2601}{121} \\approx 21.49587$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$ (RR_1 - 1)f_1 + (RR_2 - 1)f_2 = \\left(\\frac{51}{11} - 1\\right)(0.255) + \\left(\\frac{2601}{121} - 1\\right)(0.0225) $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{40}{11}\\right)(0.255) + \\left(\\frac{2480}{121}\\right)(0.0225) \\approx (3.63636)(0.255) + (20.49587)(0.0225) $$\n$$ \\approx 0.92727 + 0.46116 = 1.38843 $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ f_0 + RR_1 f_1 + RR_2 f_2 = 0.7225 + \\left(\\frac{51}{11}\\right)(0.255) + \\left(\\frac{2601}{121}\\right)(0.0225) $$\n$$ \\approx 0.7225 + (4.63636)(0.255) + (21.49587)(0.0225) $$\n$$ \\approx 0.7225 + 1.18227 + 0.48366 = 2.38843 $$\nFinally, the PAF is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$ PAF \\approx \\frac{1.38843}{2.38843} \\approx 0.58132 $$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\nThe allelic odds ratio is $4.636$.\nThe population attributable fraction is $0.5813$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4.636 & 0.5813 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2879161"}, {"introduction": "While genes may confer risk, the actual activation of an autoreactive T cell is a decisive event governed by a delicate balance of signals.

The solution involves solving for the equilibrium concentration of CD28–CD80/86 complexes, denoted by $x$, in each case.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing equations from fundamental principles as instructed.

We first justify the use of a quasi-steady approximation. The characteristic timescale for diffusion to equilibrate across the islet of thickness $L$ is $\\tau_{D} = \\frac{L^2}{D}$. Using the provided values:\n$$ \\tau_{D} = \\frac{(75\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}} = \\frac{5625}{100}\\,\\mathrm{min} = 56.25\\,\\mathrm{min} $$\nThe observation time is $t = 6\\,\\mathrm{h} = 360\\,\\mathrm{min}$. The ratio of these times is $\\frac{t}{\\tau_{D}} = \\frac{360}{56.25} \\approx 6.4$. Since the observation time is substantially longer than the characteristic diffusion time, the system will be very close to its steady state. We can therefore approximate the density profile $n(x, t=6\\,\\mathrm{h})$ with the steady-state profile $n_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x)$, which is defined by the condition $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n\nFrom the conservation law, $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = 0$ implies that $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0$. This means the steady-state flux, which we denote $J_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x)$, must be a constant with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$. The problem provides a no-flux boundary condition at the islet core, $J(L,t)=0$. Consequently, $J_{\\mathrm{ss}}(L)=0$. Since the flux must be constant throughout the domain $[0,L]$ and is zero at $x=L$, it must be zero everywhere: $J_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,L]$.\n\nThe condition $J_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x) = 0$ translates into a first-order ordinary differential equation for the steady-state density profile $n_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x)$:\n$$ -D \\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{dx} + \\chi n_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\frac{dc}{dx} = 0 $$\nSubstituting $\\frac{dc}{dx} = g$, we have:\n$$ D \\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{dx} = \\chi g n_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nThis equation is separable. We can write it as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{n_{\\mathrm{ss}}} dn_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{\\chi g}{D} dx $$\nIntegrating both sides yields $\\ln(n_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = \\frac{\\chi g}{D} x + C'$, where $C'$ is the constant of integration. Exponentiating gives the general solution:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x) = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\chi g x}{D}\\right) $$\nwhere $C = \\exp(C')$. The constant $C$ is determined by the boundary condition at the interface $x=0$, which is $n(0,t)=n_{\\mathrm{out}}$. At steady state, this becomes $n_{\\mathrm{ss}}(0)=n_{\\mathrm{out}}$. Applying this condition:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{ss}}(0) = C \\exp(0) = C = n_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThus, the steady-state T-cell density profile inside the islet is:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x) = n_{\\mathrm{out}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\chi g x}{D}\\right) $$\nThis profile shows an exponential increase in cell density from the interface to the core, driven by the chemotactic attraction towards higher CXCL10 concentrations.\n\nNow we compute the accumulation factor $A$. Using our steady-state approximation $n(x, t=6\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx n_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x)$:\n$$ A = \\frac{\\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L} n_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x)\\,dx}{n_{\\mathrm{out}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L} n_{\\mathrm{out}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\chi g x}{D}\\right) \\,dx}{n_{\\mathrm{out}}} $$\nThe factor $n_{\\mathrm{out}}$ cancels, leaving:\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\chi g x}{D}\\right) \\,dx $$\nTo simplify, we define the dimensionless Péclet number, $P_e$, which quantifies the ratio of chemotactic transport to diffusive transport:\n$$ P_e = \\frac{\\chi g L}{D} $$\nThe expression for $A$ can be written in terms of $P_e$:\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L} \\exp\\left(\\frac{P_e x}{L}\\right) \\,dx $$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\frac{L}{P_e} \\exp\\left(\\frac{P_e x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{x=0}^{x=L} = \\frac{1}{P_e} \\left( \\exp(P_e) - \\exp(0) \\right) $$\nThis gives the final symbolic expression for the accumulation factor:\n$$ A = \\frac{\\exp(P_e) - 1}{P_e} $$\nWe now substitute the numerical values to calculate $P_e$:\n$$ P_e = \\frac{(30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{nM}^{-1}) (0.02\\,\\mathrm{nM}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) (75\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})}{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}} = \\frac{30 \\times 0.02 \\times 75}{100} = \\frac{45}{100} = 0.45 $$\nThe Péclet number is $0.45$. Finally, we compute the numerical value for $A$:\n$$ A = \\frac{\\exp(0.45) - 1}{0.45} \\approx \\frac{1.568312185 - 1}{0.45} = \\frac{0.568312185}{0.45} \\approx 1.262915967 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain the final answer for the accumulation factor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.263}\n$$", "id": "2879116"}]}
