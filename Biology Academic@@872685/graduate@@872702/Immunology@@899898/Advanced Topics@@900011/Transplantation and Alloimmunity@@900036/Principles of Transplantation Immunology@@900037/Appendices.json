Single antigen bead testing on a Luminex platform shows donor-specific antibodies (DSA; donor-specific anti-human leukocyte antigen, HLA) to class II loci with high mean fluorescence intensity (MFI): anti-HLA-DQ7 at $12000$ and anti-HLA-DQ2 at $8500$. No class I DSA are detected. Complement-binding assessment using a C1q-binding assay (first component of complement, C1q) is negative for all detected DSA. T-cell and B-cell flow cytometric crossmatches are negative. The planned maintenance regimen is tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. There is no living donor exchange option. You are asked to stratify the risk for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and propose a monitoring plan.\n\nStarting from foundational principles:\n- Alloantibody-mediated injury requires binding of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to alloantigen with sufficient avidity and density to recruit effector mechanisms. The classical complement pathway is initiated when C1q binds clustered IgG Fc domains, a process facilitated by high epitope density and IgG subclass properties.\n- HLA class II antigens (e.g., HLA-DQ) are highly expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells and can be upregulated on graft endothelium under inflammatory conditions, and donor-specific anti-HLA-DQ antibodies have been strongly associated with chronic active AMR and transplant glomerulopathy.\n- Luminex MFI is a semi-quantitative surrogate of antibody strength and breadth, influenced by assay conditions (including the possibility of prozone effect), while C1q negativity suggests lower immediate risk of complement-mediated injury but does not exclude pathogenic potential via complement-independent mechanisms (e.g., Fc gamma receptor engagement).\n- Risk assessment must integrate immunobiology with test limitations, and monitoring should aim at early detection of subclinical injury and evolving DSA characteristics.\n\nWhich of the following best reflects an evidence-based risk stratification and monitoring plan for this patient?\n\nA. Low risk for AMR because of negative C1q; proceed without changes to standard care. No further DSA testing until $12$ months post-transplant, no protocol biopsy, and routine renal function monitoring at standard intervals.\n\nB. Intermediate risk for AMR due to high MFI class II (HLA-DQ) DSA despite negative C1q; proceed without desensitization but:\n- Address assay limitations pre-transplant by repeating DSA with serum dilution and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatment to assess for prozone and confirm true MFI; consider immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclassing and C3d-binding assay.\n- Optimize baseline immunosuppression adherence and target tacrolimus troughs in the upper range early post-transplant as per center protocol.\n- Enhanced surveillance: monitor serum creatinine and proteinuria weekly for the first $8$ weeks, then biweekly to $3$ months; repeat DSA at $2$, $4$, $8$, and $12$ weeks and quarterly through year $1$; perform an early protocol biopsy at $3$ months or earlier if DSA rises by a clinically meaningful increment (e.g., $>\\!3000$ MFI) or graft function changes.\n\nC. High risk for AMR requiring desensitization and prophylaxis; treat as incompatible transplant with pre- and post-operative plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and administer a complement C5 inhibitor prophylactically, because the MFI values are $>\\!8000$ even though C1q is negative.\n\nD. No meaningful risk of AMR because C1q is negative; C1q negativity proves the absence of pathogenic DSA. Proceed to transplant with standard immunosuppression and do not perform DSA or biopsy monitoring unless creatinine doubles.", "solution": "An analysis of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a kidney transplant candidate:\n- History: Two prior pregnancies.\n- Pre-transplant antibody testing (Luminex Single Antigen Bead):\n  - Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) to Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class II:\n    - Anti-HLA-DQ$7$ Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) = $12000$.\n    - Anti-HLA-DQ$2$ MFI = $8500$.\n  - No Class I DSA detected.\n- Complement-binding assessment (C1q-binding assay): Negative for all detected DSA.\n- Crossmatch testing (Flow Cytometric): Negative for both T-cell and B-cell.\n- Planned maintenance immunosuppression: Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids.\n- Logistical constraint: No living donor exchange option is available.\n- Task: Stratify the risk for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and propose a monitoring plan.\nThe problem also includes several foundational principles of transplantation immunology regarding alloantibody-mediated injury, the pathogenic role of anti-HLA-DQ antibodies, the interpretation of Luminex MFI and C1q assays, and the goals of risk assessment.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is subjected to rigorous validation.\n1.  **Scientific and Factual Soundness:** The scenario is entirely grounded in established principles of modern transplantation immunology. The presence of high MFI, Class II (specifically DQ) DSA following pregnancy is a classic sensitizing event. The use of Luminex MFI, C1q assays, and flow crossmatching represents the current standard of care for pre-transplant immunological risk assessment. The presented foundational principles are accurate summaries of contemporary understanding. The combination of high MFI, negative C1q, and negative crossmatch is a known and clinically important immunological profile. The problem does not violate any fundamental scientific laws or contain factual inaccuracies.\n2.  **Well-Posed and Objective:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific, coherent set of clinical data and asks for a risk stratification and management plan, a standard and solvable task in clinical medicine. The language is objective and precise, using established terminology and quantitative data (MFI values) without ambiguity or subjective bias.\n3.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The information provided is sufficient and internally consistent. It is immunologically plausible to have high MFI DSA that are non-complement-fixing (C1q negative) and do not result in a positive flow crossmatch. A negative T-cell crossmatch is expected as resting T-cells do not express HLA class II. A negative B-cell crossmatch despite DQ DSA can occur due to factors such as antibody avidity, antigen density on the specific donor B-cells, or assay sensitivity thresholds. This consistency allows for a nuanced, evidence-based risk assessment.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. We will therefore proceed with a full derivation of the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to stratify risk and propose a plan. This requires a synthesis of the patient's immunologic data with the provided foundational principles.\n\n1.  **Risk Stratification:**\n    - The presence of pre-formed donor-specific antibodies (DSA) fundamentally categorizes the patient as being at an increased risk for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) compared to a patient with no DSA.\n    - The MFI values of the anti-HLA-DQ DSA are high ($12000$ and $8500$). While MFI is a semi-quantitative measure, such high values are consistently associated with a greater risk of AMR and allograft loss. In particular, anti-HLA-DQ antibodies are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of late and chronic active AMR, a major cause of graft failure.\n    - However, several factors mitigate this risk. The absence of Class I DSA is favorable, as Class I antibodies are more commonly associated with acute AMR. The C1q-binding assay is negative, indicating these DSA do not fix the first component of the classical complement cascade, C1q, with high avidity *in vitro*. This suggests a lower risk of immediate, fulminant, complement-dependent cytotoxicity. C1q negativity, however, **does not** equate to an absence of pathogenicity. Antibody-mediated injury can proceed via complement-independent pathways, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by natural killer (NK) cells engaging the IgG Fc domain via Fc gamma receptors.\n    - The negative T-cell and B-cell flow cytometric crossmatches are critical. A positive crossmatch would indicate that the recipient’s antibodies are capable of binding to donor lymphocytes *ex vivo*, signifying a very high risk of hyperacute or accelerated acute rejection. The negative crossmatches suggest that the immediate risk of such events is low, and proceeding with transplantation is considered reasonable.\n    - **Conclusion on Risk:** The patient is neither \"low risk\" (due to high MFI DSA) nor \"high risk\" to the point of being a contraindication or requiring mandatory desensitization (due to negative crossmatches and negative C1q). The most accurate classification is **intermediate risk** or **increased risk**. The primary concern is not hyperacute rejection, but rather the development of subacute or chronic AMR post-transplant.\n\n2.  **Management and Monitoring Plan:**\n    - A plan for an intermediate-risk patient should not be standard care, nor should it be the most aggressive protocol. The correct strategy is one of \"watchful waiting\" with enhanced vigilance.\n    - **Pre-transplant/Peri-operative:** Given the negative crossmatches and C1q negativity, aggressive desensitization (e.g., plasmapheresis, high-dose IVIG) is generally not warranted and would impose unnecessary risk and cost. However, it is prudent to confirm the assay results. Luminex MFI can be subject to a \"prozone phenomenon\" where very high antibody titers can cause a false decrease in the signal; serum dilutions can unmask this. IgG subclass analysis could further clarify risk, as IgG1 and IgG3 are potent complement activators, while IgG2 and IgG4 are not.\n    - **Post-transplant Immunosuppression:** The standard triple therapy is appropriate, but it should be optimized. This means ensuring strict patient adherence and often targeting the upper end of the therapeutic range for the calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus) in the early post-transplant period to provide robust immunosuppression.\n    - **Post-transplant Surveillance:** This is the cornerstone of management. The goal is to detect subclinical or early clinical AMR before irreversible damage occurs. An enhanced surveillance protocol must include:\n        - **Frequent renal function monitoring:** More frequent checks of serum creatinine and proteinuria than in a standard-risk patient.\n        - **Frequent DSA monitoring:** Serial measurements of DSA are essential to track their evolution. A significant rise in MFI or the development of *de novo* DSA would be an immediate trigger for further investigation, likely a graft biopsy.\n        - **Protocol Biopsy:** A biopsy performed at a scheduled time (e.g., $3$ months), irrespective of graft function, is a powerful tool to detect subclinical rejection (both AMR and T-cell mediated rejection). For this patient, an early protocol biopsy is strongly indicated.\n\nThis derived strategy—classifying the risk as intermediate and implementing a plan of optimized immunosuppression with enhanced surveillance—is the evidence-based standard of care.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Low risk for AMR because of negative C1q; proceed without changes to standard care. No further DSA testing until $12$ months post-transplant, no protocol biopsy, and routine renal function monitoring at standard intervals.**\nThis option drastically underestimates the risk. It incorrectly equates negative C1q with \"low risk\" and completely ignores the strong predictive power of high-MFI DQ DSA for chronic AMR. The proposed monitoring plan is dangerously inadequate for a sensitized patient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Intermediate risk for AMR due to high MFI class II (HLA-DQ) DSA despite negative C1q; proceed without desensitization but: Address assay limitations pre-transplant by repeating DSA with serum dilution and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatment to assess for prozone and confirm true MFI; consider immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclassing and C3d-binding assay. Optimize baseline immunosuppression adherence and target tacrolimus troughs in the upper range early post-transplant as per center protocol. Enhanced surveillance: monitor serum creatinine and proteinuria weekly for the first $8$ weeks, then biweekly to $3$ months; repeat DSA at $2$, $4$, $8$, and $12$ weeks and quarterly through year $1$; perform an early protocol biopsy at $3$ months or earlier if DSA rises by a clinically meaningful increment (e.g., $>\\!3000$ MFI) or graft function changes.**\nThis option correctly stratifies the risk as \"intermediate\". It accurately balances the risk of the high MFI DSA against the mitigating factors of negative C1q and negative crossmatches. The proposal to proceed without aggressive desensitization but to implement a comprehensive plan of pre-transplant assay validation, optimized immunosuppression, and intensive post-transplant surveillance (frequent labs, frequent DSA monitoring, and an early protocol biopsy) is fully consistent with the derived, evidence-based standard of care.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. High risk for AMR requiring desensitization and prophylaxis; treat as incompatible transplant with pre- and post-operative plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and administer a complement C5 inhibitor prophylactically, because the MFI values are $>\\!8000$ even though C1q is negative.**\nThis option represents over-treatment. While the MFI is high, the negative crossmatches and negative C1q assay results make the risk of hyperacute or severe, early acute AMR low. Aggressive desensitization with plasmapheresis/IVIG is not indicated in the absence of a positive crossmatch. Prophylactic use of a C5 inhibitor is an extreme measure reserved for the highest-risk situations (e.g., ABO-incompatible or positive crossmatch transplants) and is not justified here, especially given the C1q negative status of the DSA. This plan exposes the patient to substantial risks and costs without clear benefit.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No meaningful risk of AMR because C1q is negative; C1q negativity proves the absence of pathogenic DSA. Proceed to transplant with standard immunosuppression and do not perform DSA or biopsy monitoring unless creatinine doubles.**\nThis option is based on a dangerous scientific fallacy. The statement that \"C1q negativity proves the absence of pathogenic DSA\" is fundamentally wrong. Pathogenicity is not solely dependent on the classical complement pathway. Furthermore, the recommendation to wait for creatinine to double before acting represents a neglect of modern transplant principles, which emphasize proactive surveillance to prevent irreversible graft injury.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2884486"}, {"introduction": "Once an organ is transplanted, the recipient's immune system begins the process of \"seeing\" the foreign tissue, a process known as allorecognition.

Polyclonal bystander activation: cytokine-driven, antigen-independent activation of recipient T cells in the graft independent of MHC–T cell receptor recognition", "solution": "The problem statement presents a clinically and immunologically consistent scenario of acute T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) of a kidney allograft. All provided data—the timing, the nature of the allograft, the recipient's immunosuppression status, the clinical presentation, the specific histopathological findings, and the negative serological markers—are coherent and allow for a rigorous analysis based on fundamental principles of transplantation immunology. The problem is valid.\n\nThe central question concerns the predominant pathway of allorecognition responsible for this episode of acute rejection. Allorecognition is the process by which the recipient's immune system recognizes and responds to foreign alloantigens, primarily the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, called human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in humans. The three main pathways for T-cell allorecognition are the direct, indirect, and semi-direct pathways.\n\nThe clinical and pathological features provided are definitive for acute TCMR. The timing of $2$ weeks post-transplant is characteristic for the initial, strong T-cell response. The biopsy reveals a dense interstitial infiltrate of both CD$4^{+}$ and CD$8^{+}$ T cells, which are the primary effector cells in cellular rejection. Tubulitis (invasion of renal tubules by lymphocytes) and endotheliitis (inflammation of the vascular endothelium) are the classic histopathological lesions mediated by these effector T cells. Crucially, the rejection is not antibody-mediated, as evidenced by the negative C4d staining (a marker for classical complement pathway activation, typically associated with antibodies) and the absence of detectable donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). This focuses the analysis strictly on T-cell mediated mechanisms.\n\nLet us analyze the pathways in the context of this problem:\n\n1.  **Direct Pathway of Allorecognition**: In this pathway, recipient T cells directly engage with intact, foreign (donor) MHC molecules on the surface of donor-derived antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These donor APCs, often referred to as \"passenger leukocytes,\" are transported within the vascularized organ graft, egress from the graft, and migrate via lymphatics to the recipient's regional secondary lymphoid tissues (e.g., draining lymph nodes). Here, they present donor peptides on donor MHC molecules to a large population of recipient T cells. The frequency of T cells in a naive individual capable of recognizing an intact foreign MHC molecule is remarkably high (on the order of $1-10\\%$ of the T-cell repertoire), as opposed to the frequency of T cells specific for a single foreign peptide presented by self-MHC (typically less than $0.01\\%$ or $10^{-5}$). This high precursor frequency is the basis for the potent and rapid T-cell activation that characterizes early acute cellular rejection. This pathway robustly activates both CD$4^{+}$ T cells (recognizing donor MHC class II) and CD$8^{+}$ T cells (recognizing donor MHC class I), consistent with the biopsy findings. The activated effector T cells then traffic to the allograft to mediate tissue destruction. Given the $2$-week timeframe and the aggressive T-cell mediated pathology, the direct pathway is the expected predominant mechanism.\n\n2.  **Indirect Pathway of Allorecognition**: In this pathway, recipient APCs endocytose proteins from the donor graft (e.g., shed MHC molecules or cellular debris), process them into peptides, and present these donor-derived peptides on their own self-MHC molecules. This is a conventional T-cell response to a foreign protein. Primarily, this pathway activates CD$4^{+}$ T helper cells, as exogenous antigens are processed through the MHC class II pathway. These CD$4^{+}$ T cells are critical for providing help to B cells, leading to the production of DSAs. The absence of detectable DSAs in this patient argues against the predominance of the indirect pathway at this time. While cross-presentation can activate CD$8^{+}$ T cells, the indirect pathway is generally considered to be less potent than the direct pathway in initiating early acute rejection and is more implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic rejection.\n\n3.  **Semi-direct Pathway of Allorecognition**: This pathway involves the acquisition of intact donor MHC-peptide complexes by recipient APCs, which then display these complexes on their surface. This allows a recipient APC to present a foreign MHC molecule directly to a recipient T cell. This mechanism can contribute to the priming of alloreactive T cells, especially CD$8^{+}$ T cells. However, its quantitative contribution relative to the massive antigen presentation by donor \"passenger leukocytes\" in the early post-transplant period is thought to be smaller. The direct pathway remains the classic and most powerful explanation for the initial storm of acute cellular rejection.\n\nBased on this analysis, the direct pathway of allorecognition is the mechanistic engine driving this early and severe episode of TCMR.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options:\n\nA. Direct allorecognition: recipient T cells recognize intact donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules bearing donor peptides on donor-derived professional antigen-presenting cells that migrated from the graft\nThis option provides an accurate description of the direct pathway. As derived above, this mechanism perfectly explains the timing ($2$ weeks), the cellular players (CD$4^{+}$ and CD$8^{+}$ T cells), the high potency of the response, and the resulting pathological findings in the absence of an antibody response. The donor APCs migrating from the graft are the key initiators.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Indirect allorecognition: recipient T cells recognize donor-derived peptides presented by recipient MHC on recipient antigen-presenting cells\nThis is a correct description of the indirect pathway. However, this pathway is not the *predominant* driver of early acute cellular rejection. Its stronger association is with chronic rejection and the generation of DSAs, which are absent here. Therefore, it is not the most plausible predominant mechanism in this scenario.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Semi-direct allorecognition: recipient antigen-presenting cells acquire intact donor MHC–peptide complexes and present them to recipient T cells\nThis is a correct description of the semi-direct pathway. While it is a valid mechanism of allorecognition that can contribute to the alloresponse, it is not considered the primary driver of the initial, powerful wave of T-cell activation seen in early acute rejection when compared to the direct pathway, which involves a large load of professional donor APCs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Polyclonal bystander activation: cytokine-driven, antigen-independent activation of recipient T cells in the graft independent of MHC–T cell receptor recognition\nThis describes a non-specific inflammatory process. While ischemia-reperfusion injury and the nascent rejection process create a pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu that can cause some bystander activation, this cannot be the predominant mechanism. The pathology of acute cellular rejection, with its characteristic lesions like tubulitis and endotheliitis, reflects a highly specific, antigen-driven attack on graft cells expressing foreign MHC. The question asks for a pathway of *allorecognition*, which by definition is an antigen-specific process mediated by the T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing an MHC-peptide complex. Bystander activation is antigen-independent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2884390"}, {"introduction": "When graft dysfunction is suspected, a biopsy provides the definitive diagnosis by revealing the nature of the immunological assault.

A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe task is to diagnose the cause of allograft dysfunction using the provided clinical and pathological data, based on the Banff classification system for kidney transplant pathology. The core of the problem lies in distinguishing between T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), or other causes.\n\n1.  **Analysis of T Cell-Mediated Rejection (TCMR) Markers:**\n    The diagnosis of acute TCMR is based primarily on the scores for interstitial inflammation ($i$) and tubulitis ($t$). The criteria for different grades are as follows:\n    -   Borderline: Inflammation that does not meet the criteria for TCMR (e.g., $i=2, t=1$).\n    -   Grade IA: Significant interstitial inflammation ($i \\ge 2$) and moderate tubulitis ($t=2$).\n    -   Grade IB: Significant interstitial inflammation ($i \\ge 2$) and severe tubulitis ($t=3$).\n    -   Grade II/III: Involve progressive degrees of intimal arteritis ($v > 0$).\n    The patient's biopsy shows $i=2$ and $t=2$. This combination precisely matches the criteria for **Acute TCMR, Grade IA**. The absence of arteritis ($v=0$) rules out TCMR grades II and III.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Antibody-Mediated Rejection (ABMR) Markers:**\n    The diagnosis of active ABMR requires that all three of the following criteria are met:\n    -   **Criterion 1: Histologic evidence of acute tissue injury.** This can include microvascular inflammation ($g+ptc > 0$), arteritis, or other specific lesions. The patient has $g=1$ and $ptc=1$, their sum is $g+ptc=2$, which constitutes microvascular inflammation. Thus, this criterion is met.\n    -   **Criterion 2: Evidence of antibody interaction with endothelium.** This is typically satisfied by either (a) positive C4d staining, or (b) at least moderate microvascular inflammation ($g+ptc \\ge 2$) in the absence of other causes. The patient's C4d is negative. However, with $g+ptc = 2$, this criterion is met via sub-criterion (b).\n    -   **Criterion 3: Serologic evidence of circulating DSA.** The problem explicitly states that DSA are **undetectable**. Therefore, this criterion is **not met**.\n    Since a diagnosis of active ABMR requires all three criteria to be satisfied, ABMR is ruled out. Even the category of C4d-negative ABMR requires the presence of DSA.\n\n3.  **Pathophysiological Correlation:**\n    The diagnosis is unequivocally Acute TCMR, Grade IA. This process occurs early after transplantation and is classically mediated by the **direct pathway of allorecognition**, where recipient T cells recognize intact donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on donor antigen-presenting cells.\n    -   The tubulitis ($t=2$) is the histologic correlate of donor tubular epithelial cells being attacked by recipient cytotoxic T lymphocytes ($CD8^{+}$ T cells).\n    -   The interstitial inflammation ($i=2$) results from the infiltration of mononuclear cells, orchestrated by cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma) released by activated helper T cells ($CD4^{+}$ T cells).\n    -   The absence of DSA and the consequently negative C4d staining confirm that the rejection process is cell-mediated, not antibody-mediated. The mild microvascular inflammation ($g=1$, $ptc=1$) can be seen as \"bystander\" inflammation in severe TCMR and does not, by itself, indicate ABMR in the absence of DSA.\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Other Diagnoses:**\n    -   **Borderline changes:** The findings ($i=2, t=2$) exceed the threshold for a \"borderline\" diagnosis.\n    -   **Mixed rejection (TCMR + ABMR):** This is ruled out because the criteria for ABMR are not met.\n    -   **Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI):** While IRI causes early graft dysfunction, it is characterized by acute tubular necrosis, not the organized and severe lymphocytic infiltration seen here ($i=2, t=2$). Attributing these specific lesions to nonspecific injury is incorrect.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the only diagnosis that fits the complete dataset is Acute TCMR, Grade IA.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Acute T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), Banff grade IA; driven predominantly by direct allorecognition of donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) by recipient T cells, with CD8$^{+}$ cytotoxic T lymphocyte–mediated tubular epithelial injury and CD4$^{+}$ T helper type $1$ cytokine–driven interstitial inflammation; absent complement-fixing donor-specific antibodies explains C4d negativity.**\nThis option provides the correct diagnosis, **Acute TCMR, Grade IA**, based on the Banff scores $i=2$ and $t=2$. The pathophysiological explanation is fundamentally sound: direct allorecognition drives early rejection, with $CD8^{+}$ T cells causing tubulitis and $CD4^{+}$ T cells orchestrating interstitial inflammation. The statement correctly links the absence of DSA to the negative C4d finding, as C4d is a marker of the classical complement cascade typically initiated by antibodies. Every part of this statement is accurate and consistent with the provided data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Active antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR); driven by donor-specific antibodies causing classical complement activation and endothelial injury, as evidenced by glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis; C4d negativity rules out T cell involvement.**\nThis option is incorrect. The diagnosis of **ABMR** is falsified by the absence of detectable DSA, which is a mandatory criterion. The proposed mechanism of \"classical complement activation\" is contradicted by the negative C4d staining. The final clause, \"C4d negativity rules out T cell involvement,\" is a grave error in immunological reasoning; C4d status is related to humoral immunity, not cellular immunity. TCMR is characteristically C4d-negative.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Borderline changes suspicious for acute TCMR; due to subthreshold T cell activation from inadequate costimulation producing minimal tissue injury without meeting criteria for rejection.**\nThis option is incorrect. The histopathology is not \"subthreshold\" or \"minimal.\" The Banff scores of $i=2$ and $t=2$ are not borderline; they are the definitive criteria for **Acute TCMR, Grade IA**. The statement that the findings do not meet an immunological threshold for rejection is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Mixed rejection (concurrent acute TCMR and ABMR); simultaneous T cell and antibody mechanisms are indicated by tubulitis and microvascular inflammation, and C4d negativity does not affect the diagnosis.**\nThis option is incorrect. A diagnosis of **mixed rejection** requires satisfying the full criteria for both TCMR and ABMR. As established, the criteria for ABMR are not met due to the absence of DSA. The statement \"C4d negativity does not affect the diagnosis\" is misleading; while C4d-negative ABMR exists, it still requires DSA, so the combination of negative C4d and negative DSA is decisive in ruling out ABMR.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Ischemia–reperfusion injury; due to oxidative stress and endothelial activation causing mild microvascular inflammation without adaptive immune involvement; tubulitis reflects nonspecific tubular stress rather than immune-mediated injury.**\nThis option is incorrect. It dismisses the pathognomonic findings of an adaptive immune response. A tubulitis score of $t=2$ represents significant lymphocytic infiltration into tubules and is the hallmark of TCMR, not \"nonspecific tubular stress.\" The degree of organized inflammation ($i=2, t=2$) cannot be explained by IRI, especially at $14$ days post-transplant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2884461"}]}
