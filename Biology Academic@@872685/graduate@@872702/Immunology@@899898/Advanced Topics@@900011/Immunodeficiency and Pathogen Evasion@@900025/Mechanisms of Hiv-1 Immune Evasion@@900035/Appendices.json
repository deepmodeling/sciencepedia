AP-1 is involved in sorting at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. AP-2 is involved in endocytosis from the plasma membrane.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established mechanisms of HIV-1 immunoevasion, specifically the multiple trafficking-related functions of the Nef protein. The experimental data provided are consistent with known literature: wild-type Nef robustly downregulates CD4 and selectively downregulates HLA-A and HLA-B while sparing HLA-C. The phenotype of the unknown mutant—selective loss of HLA-A/B downregulation with preserved CD4 downregulation—is a distinct and mechanistically informative result. The problem provides sufficient information and principles to logically deduce the identity of the mutation from the given options. The problem setup is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or otherwise flawed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Analysis of the Experimental Phenotype**\n\nThe objective is to identify a mutation in Nef that accounts for the observed experimental data. We must first precisely define the phenotype of the unknown mutant relative to the wild-type protein.\n$1$. **Wild-type Nef function:** The data confirm that wild-type Nef performs two primary downregulation functions in this system:\n    -   It strongly downregulates surface CD4 (from $100\\%$ to $28\\%$).\n    -   It selectively downregulates surface HLA-A and HLA-B (to $38\\%$ and $45\\%$, respectively) while largely sparing HLA-C ($96\\%$).\n$2$. **Unknown Mutant Nef function:** The data for the mutant show a dissociation of these two functions:\n    -   The ability to downregulate CD4 is preserved; the surface level is reduced to $30\\%$, a value comparable to the wild-type effect ($28\\%$).\n    -   The ability to downregulate HLA-A and HLA-B is almost completely abolished; surface levels remain high at $92\\%$ and $90\\%$, respectively, which are very near the control level of $100\\%$. HLA-C remains unaffected ($98\\%$), as expected.\n\nTherefore, the causal mutation must be one that specifically abrogates the molecular mechanism responsible for HLA-A/B downregulation while leaving the mechanism for CD4 downregulation functionally intact.\n\n**Mechanistic Basis of Nef-Mediated Downregulation**\n\nThe problem statement directs us to consider the roles of adaptor protein complexes. The mechanisms for CD4 and HLA-I downregulation by Nef are distinct and rely on different motifs within Nef interacting with different adaptor complexes.\n\n-   **CD4 Downregulation:** Nef enhances the endocytosis of CD4 from the cell surface. It acts as a connector, linking the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 to the AP-2 clathrin adaptor complex. This interaction is primarily mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif ($LL$) in the C-terminal flexible loop of Nef. Mutation of this dileucine motif disrupts Nef-AP-2 binding and selectively impairs CD4 downregulation.\n\n-   **HLA-A/B Downregulation:** Nef prevents the transit of newly synthesized HLA-A and HLA-B molecules to the cell surface by re-routing them from the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) to the endo-lysosomal pathway for degradation. Nef connects the cytoplasmic tails of HLA-A/B to the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex at the TGN. This interaction is critically dependent on an acidic cluster motif ($EEEE$) in the N-terminal region of Nef. Mutation of this acidic cluster disrupts Nef-AP-1 binding and selectively impairs HLA-A/B downregulation.\n\n-   **Membrane Association:** For Nef to perform any of its functions involving membrane-bound receptors (CD4, HLA-I) and membrane-associated trafficking machinery (AP-1, AP-2), it must first be anchored to cellular membranes. This is achieved via N-terminal myristoylation at glycine residue 2 (G2).\n\nWith these principles, we can evaluate each option.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. N-terminal myristoylation site mutant $G2A$ (abolishes membrane attachment)**\nThis mutation prevents the attachment of myristate, a lipid anchor. The resulting Nef protein is soluble in the cytosol and cannot associate with the plasma membrane or Golgi membranes. Without membrane localization, Nef cannot access its targets (CD4, HLA-I) or the relevant adaptor complexes. Consequently, a $G2A$ mutant is incompetent for *both* CD4 downregulation and HLA-A/B downregulation. The experimental data show that CD4 downregulation is intact. This option is therefore inconsistent with the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Acidic cluster mutant at residues $62\\text{–}65$ ($EEEE \\rightarrow AAAA$)**\nThis mutation disrupts the AP-1 binding site on Nef. As the Nef-AP-1 interaction is essential for diverting HLA-A and HLA-B from the TGN, this mutant would lose the ability to downregulate these molecules. Surface expression of HLA-A and HLA-B would remain high. However, CD4 downregulation, which depends on the AP-2 adaptor binding to the dileucine motif elsewhere on Nef, would be unaffected. This predicted phenotype—loss of HLA-A/B downregulation with preservation of CD4 downregulation—precisely matches the experimental data ($HLA\\text{-}A/B > 90\\%$, $CD4 \\approx 30\\%$).\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Dileucine sorting motif mutant at residues $164/165$ ($LL \\rightarrow AA$)**\nThis mutation disrupts the AP-2 binding site on Nef. The Nef-AP-2 interaction is required for enhanced endocytosis of CD4. Therefore, this mutant would lose the ability to downregulate CD4. Surface expression of CD4 would remain high. The mechanism for HLA-A/B downregulation, which depends on the acidic cluster and AP-1, would remain intact. This predicts the opposite phenotype to what was observed: preservation of HLA-A/B downregulation and loss of CD4 downregulation. This is inconsistent with the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding proline-rich motif mutant $P72A/P75A$**\nThis proline-rich motif ($PxxP$) mediates interactions with SH3 domains of cellular signaling proteins, such as Src-family tyrosine kinases (e.g., Hck). These interactions are involved in altering T cell activation signaling pathways to promote viral replication but are not directly required for the downregulation of CD4 or HLA-I via clathrin adaptor pathways. A mutation in this domain would primarily affect signaling functions, while the protein trafficking functions would be expected to remain largely intact. The phenotype would approximate that of wild-type Nef in this assay (downregulation of both CD4 and HLA-A/B). This does not match the specific loss of HLA-A/B downregulation seen in the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2867422"}, {"introduction": "While Nef works to hide the infected cell from T cells, the free virus particle itself must evade neutralizing antibodies circulating in the blood.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of glycans on a single Env trimer. This can be solved using the properties of expectation, specifically the linearity of expectation.\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable, $X_{i,j}$, for the event that a glycan is present at a specific site. Let $i$ be the index for the potential glycosylation site on a given protomer, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 28\\}$, and let $j$ be the index for the protomer within the trimer, where $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe variable $X_{i,j}$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_{i,j} = \\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if site } i \\text{ on protomer } j \\text{ is occupied by a glycan} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if site } i \\text{ on protomer } j \\text{ is unoccupied}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem states that the probability of any given site being occupied is $p = 0.85$. Therefore, the probability distribution of $X_{i,j}$ is a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$.\n$$\nP(X_{i,j} = 1) = p = 0.85\n$$\n$$\nP(X_{i,j} = 0) = 1 - p = 0.15\n$$\nThe expected value of a Bernoulli random variable is simply the probability of success. Thus, the expected value of $X_{i,j}$ is:\n$$\nE[X_{i,j}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{i,j} = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_{i,j} = 0) = p = 0.85\n$$\nThe total number of glycans on the Env trimer, which we denote as $N_{trimer}$, is the sum of the occupancies of all possible sites across all three protomers. The total number of potential sites on the trimer is $N_{total} = N_{protomers} \\times N_{sites} = 3 \\times 28 = 84$.\n$$\nN_{trimer} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{28} X_{i,j}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the expected number of glycans per trimer, which is $E[N_{trimer}]$. A fundamental property of expectation is its linearity: the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$\nE[N_{trimer}] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{28} X_{i,j}\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{28} E[X_{i,j}]\n$$\nSince the expected value $E[X_{i,j}]$ is the same for all sites and all protomers ($E[X_{i,j}] = p = 0.85$), we can simplify the sum. The sum consists of $N_{total} = 84$ identical terms.\n$$\nE[N_{trimer}] = \\sum_{k=1}^{84} p = 84 \\cdot p\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nE[N_{trimer}] = 84 \\times 0.85 = 71.4\n$$\nThis value is already given to three significant figures.\n\nMechanistic explanation:\nThe high density of N-linked glycans on the HIV-1 Env trimer forms a physical barrier known as the \"glycan shield.\" These carbohydrate molecules are large and flexible, projecting from the viral protein surface. B cell receptors (BCRs) and the antibodies they produce are also large protein complexes. The glycan shield sterically occludes, or hides, the underlying protein epitopes on the Env surface from recognition and binding by these immune molecules. Because the glycans are synthesized by the host cell's machinery, they are recognized as \"self\" and are non-immunogenic. This allows the virus to camouflage its foreign protein antigens under a cloak of host-like molecules, thus evading the humoral immune response.\n\nCaveats introduced by incomplete occupancy and heterogeneity:\n1.  **Incomplete Occupancy**: The occupancy probability of $p = 0.85$ implies that, on average, $15\\%$ of potential N-linked glycosylation sites are unoccupied. These unoccupied sites create \"holes\" or gaps in the glycan shield, exposing patches of the underlying protein. These exposed regions could potentially serve as epitopes for neutralizing antibodies. However, the high mutation rate of HIV-1 allows the virus to rapidly alter the positions of its glycosylation sites, effectively moving these holes and escaping any antibody response that might develop against them.\n2.  **Site Heterogeneity**: The problem simplifies reality by assuming a uniform glycan type. In fact, N-linked glycans undergo differential processing in the host cell Golgi apparatus, resulting in site-specific microheterogeneity. A single glycosylation site can be occupied by various glycan structures (e.g., high-mannose, complex, or hybrid types), each with different sizes, shapes, and flexibility. This structural diversity makes the glycan shield a non-uniform, heterogeneous surface, further complicating the challenge for B cells to produce broadly effective antibodies that can navigate this landscape to reach conserved protein epitopes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{71.4}\n$$", "id": "2867364"}, {"introduction": "The interplay between HIV-1 and the immune system is a dynamic evolutionary arms race, not a static confrontation.

A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\nThe problem states that the frequency of the escape variant, $f(t)$, follows logistic dynamics under a constant selection coefficient $s$. The differential equation describing this process is:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dt} = s \\cdot f(t) \\cdot (1 - f(t))\n$$\nHere, $f(t)$ is the frequency of the escape mutant and $(1 - f(t))$ is the frequency of the wild-type. The term $f(1-f)$ represents the genetic variance in the population, and $s$ is the selection coefficient that quantifies the fitness advantage of the escape variant.\n\nTo solve for $s$, we must first solve this differential equation. It is a separable equation. We rearrange the terms to separate the variables $f$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{f(1-f)} = s \\cdot dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The left side is integrated between two frequencies $f_1 = f(t_1)$ and $f_2 = f(t_2)$, and the right side is integrated between the corresponding time points $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n$$\n\\int_{f_1}^{f_2} \\frac{1}{f(1-f)} \\,df = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} s \\,dt\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral on the left, we use partial fraction decomposition for the term $\\frac{1}{f(1-f)}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f(1-f)} = \\frac{A}{f} + \\frac{B}{1-f} = \\frac{A(1-f) + Bf}{f(1-f)}\n$$\nThis implies $1 = A(1-f) + Bf$. Setting $f=0$ gives $A=1$. Setting $f=1$ gives $B=1$. Thus, the decomposition is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f(1-f)} = \\frac{1}{f} + \\frac{1}{1-f}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{f_1}^{f_2} \\left( \\frac{1}{f} + \\frac{1}{1-f} \\right) \\,df = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} s \\,dt\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|f| - \\ln|1-f|]_{f_1}^{f_2} = [st]_{t_1}^{t_2}\n$$\nSince frequency $f$ is always between $0$ and $1$, the absolute values are not necessary.\n$$\n(\\ln(f_2) - \\ln(1-f_2)) - (\\ln(f_1) - \\ln(1-f_1)) = s(t_2 - t_1)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{f_2}{1-f_2}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_1}{1-f_1}\\right) = s(t_2 - t_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left( \\frac{f_2/(1-f_2)}{f_1/(1-f_1)} \\right) = s(t_2 - t_1)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\ln\\left( \\frac{f_2(1-f_1)}{f_1(1-f_2)} \\right) = s(t_2 - t_1)\n$$\nFinally, solving for the selection coefficient $s$, we arrive at the desired expression:\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1} \\ln\\left( \\frac{f_2(1-f_1)}{f_1(1-f_2)} \\right)\n$$\nNext, we must identify the time window where the ID50 is approximately constant, justifying the assumption of a constant $s$. The ID50 values are $40$ (week $8$), $200$ (week $12$), $240$ (week $16$), and $250$ (week $20$). The change is most pronounced between week $8$ and week $12$. The values at week $16$ ($240$) and week $20$ ($250$) are very close, indicating a plateau in the neutralization response. Therefore, the most appropriate time window for our calculation is between week $16$ and week $20$.\n\nWe define our time points and calculate the corresponding frequencies:\n- $t_1 =$ week $16 = 16 \\times 7 = 112$ days.\n- $t_2 =$ week $20 = 20 \\times 7 = 140$ days.\n- The duration of the interval is $\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = 140 - 112 = 28$ days.\n\nThe frequencies are calculated from the sequencing data, assuming negligible sampling error:\n- At $t_1$, the frequency is $f_1 = \\frac{12}{60} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$.\n- At $t_2$, the frequency is $f_2 = \\frac{45}{90} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n\nNow we substitute these values into the derived expression for $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{28} \\ln\\left( \\frac{0.5 \\cdot (1-0.2)}{0.2 \\cdot (1-0.5)} \\right)\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{28} \\ln\\left( \\frac{0.5 \\cdot 0.8}{0.2 \\cdot 0.5} \\right)\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{28} \\ln\\left( \\frac{0.4}{0.1} \\right)\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{28} \\ln(4)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$, we can write $\\ln(4) = \\ln(2^2) = 2\\ln(2)$.\n$$\ns = \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{28} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{14} \\text{ day}^{-1}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we use the approximation $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147...$\n$$\ns \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{14} \\approx 0.0495105... \\text{ day}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$\ns \\approx 0.04951 \\text{ day}^{-1}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.04951}\n$$", "id": "2867399"}]}
