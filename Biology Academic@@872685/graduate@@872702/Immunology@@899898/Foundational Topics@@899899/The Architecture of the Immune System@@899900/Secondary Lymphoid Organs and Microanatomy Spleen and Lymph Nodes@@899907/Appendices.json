To begin our quantitative exploration, we first ask a fundamental question: how do antigens arriving in a lymph node actually travel? This exercise introduces the Péclet number, a critical dimensionless group from transport phenomena, which compares the rate of transport by bulk fluid flow (advection) to that by random molecular motion (diffusion). By calculating and interpreting the Péclet number for an antigen in the subcapsular sinus, you will gain a physical intuition for the dominant transport mechanisms that govern the initial stages of an immune response [@problem_id:2888207].", "problem": "Lymph-borne antigens enter the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of a lymph node, where transport occurs by fluid flow along the sinus and molecular diffusion within the lymph. Consider a 20 kilodalton antigen (a small protein) carried by afferent lymph through the SCS, idealized as a one-dimensional conduit of characteristic length scale $L$ along the flow direction. Let the mean lymph velocity be $U$, and let the molecular diffusion coefficient of the antigen in lymph at physiological temperature be $D$.\n\nUsing only conservation of mass and the standard constitutive expressions for advective and diffusive solute fluxes, derive the dimensionless group that compares advection to diffusion from first principles, expressed in terms of $U$, $L$, and $D$. Then, evaluate this dimensionless group for the following physiologically plausible parameters for the SCS:\n- Characteristic length $L = 200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$,\n- Mean velocity $U = 50\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m\\,s^{-1}}$,\n- Diffusion coefficient for a $20\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ protein in lymph $D = 80\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nFinally, based on its magnitude, determine whether advection or diffusion dominates antigen transport along the SCS for these conditions. Round your numerical result to three significant figures. The dimensionless number should be reported without units.", "solution": "The transport of a solute, such as the antigen of concentration $c(x, t)$, in a one-dimensional system is governed by the principle of conservation of mass. This principle is expressed through the advection-diffusion equation. The derivation begins with a mass balance over a differential control volume. In one dimension, this yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nwhere $J$ is the total flux of the antigen along the $x$-direction, and $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}$ is the rate of change of concentration in time. The total flux $J$ is the sum of the advective flux, $J_{adv}$, due to bulk fluid motion, and the diffusive flux, $J_{diff}$, due to random molecular motion.\n\nThe constitutive expressions for these fluxes are:\n1.  Advective flux: $J_{adv} = U c$. This represents the transport of the solute carried by the bulk fluid moving at mean velocity $U$.\n2.  Diffusive flux: $J_{diff} = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$. This is Fick's first law, describing transport down a concentration gradient, where $D$ is the molecular diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe total flux is therefore $J = J_{adv} + J_{diff} = Uc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$. Substituting this expression for the total flux into the conservation equation gives the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( Uc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right) = 0 $$\nAssuming the velocity $U$ and diffusion coefficient $D$ are constant with respect to position $x$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} $$\nThis equation describes the evolution of the antigen concentration. To compare the relative importance of advection and diffusion, we perform a scaling analysis of the terms in this equation at steady state, or for any process where both transport mechanisms are active. We are interested in comparing the magnitude of the advection term, $U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$, to the diffusion term, $D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}$.\n\nLet us estimate the order of magnitude of these terms using the characteristic scales provided. Let $L$ be the characteristic length scale over which the concentration changes significantly. Let $\\Delta c$ be the characteristic change in concentration over this length scale.\nThe first-order spatial derivative can be scaled as:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta c}{L} $$\nThe second-order spatial derivative can be scaled as:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta c/L}{L} = \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2} $$\nNow, we can estimate the magnitudes of the advection and diffusion terms:\n-   Magnitude of advection term: $|U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}| \\sim U \\frac{\\Delta c}{L}$\n-   Magnitude of diffusion term: $|D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}| \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2}$\n\nThe dimensionless group that compares advection to diffusion is the ratio of the magnitudes of these two terms:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Magnitude of Advection}}{\\text{Magnitude of Diffusion}} \\sim \\frac{U \\frac{\\Delta c}{L}}{D \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2}} $$\nSimplifying this expression, we obtain the dimensionless group:\n$$ \\frac{U L}{D} $$\nThis dimensionless number is known as the Péclet number, denoted $\\mathrm{Pe}$. It fundamentally represents the ratio of the rate of advective transport to the rate of diffusive transport.\n\nNext, we evaluate this dimensionless group for the given parameters:\n-   Characteristic length $L = 200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n-   Mean velocity $U = 50\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   Diffusion coefficient $D = 80\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the Péclet number:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D} = \\frac{(50\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m\\,s^{-1}}) (200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m})}{80\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}} $$\nThe units are consistent and cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless number:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{10000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{80\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{1000}{8} = 125 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $125$, which already contains three significant figures.\n\nFinally, we determine which transport mechanism dominates. The Péclet number provides this information:\n-   If $\\mathrm{Pe} \\gg 1$, the advective transport rate is much greater than the diffusive transport rate, and thus advection dominates.\n-   If $\\mathrm{Pe} \\ll 1$, the diffusive transport rate is much greater than the advective transport rate, and thus diffusion dominates.\n-   If $\\mathrm{Pe} \\approx 1$, both mechanisms are of comparable importance.\n\nIn this case, $\\mathrm{Pe} = 125$. Since $125 \\gg 1$, advection is the dominant mode of antigen transport along the subcapsular sinus under these conditions. The bulk flow of lymph is far more effective at transporting the antigen over the length scale of $200\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ than molecular diffusion is.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{125}\n$$", "id": "2888207"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of advection, we now move deeper into the lymph node to quantify the fluid flow that drives it.

By deriving the change in clearance half-life, you will learn to connect organ-specific microanatomy to whole-body dynamics, bridging the gap between cell biology and clinical physiology.", "problem": "Opsonized particles circulating in blood are cleared primarily by macrophages in the liver and spleen, organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). The spleen’s open circulation in the red pulp filters particles that exit the sinuses and traverse the cords, where they are retained and phagocytosed. Consider a simple two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with a central compartment (well-mixed blood) containing amount $A_{b}(t)$ and a splenic compartment (red pulp filter) containing amount $A_{s}(t)$. Particles exchange between blood and spleen with first-order rate constants $k_{bs}$ (blood to spleen) and $k_{sb}$ (spleen to blood). Elimination occurs via hepatic macrophages from blood with rate constant $k_{h}$ and via splenic filtering from the spleen with rate constant $k_{f}$.
