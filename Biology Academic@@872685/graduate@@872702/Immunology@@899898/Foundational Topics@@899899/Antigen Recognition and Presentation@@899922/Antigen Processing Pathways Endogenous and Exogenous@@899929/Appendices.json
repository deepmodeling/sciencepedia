A smaller positive Gibbs free energy of dissociation implies that the dissociation process for the mutant is less non-spontaneous, or energetically less demanding, than for the wild-type.

The stability of this complex is paramount for its transport to the cell surface and for sustained presentation to cytotoxic $\\text{CD8}^+$ T cells. The calculated negative $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{diss}}$ indicates that the mutation destabilizes the complex. A less stable pMHC-I complex is more likely to dissociate either before reaching the cell surface or too quickly upon arrival, leading to inefficient or failed activation of T cells. This could result in immune evasion by a pathogen or cancer cell.\n-   **Exogenous Pathway (MHC Class II)**: Extracellular antigens are processed and loaded onto MHC class II molecules in specialized endosomal compartments of professional antigen-presenting cells. These complexes are presented to helper $\\text{CD4}^+$ T cells. Similarly, a destabilizing mutation, as quantified by the negative $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{diss}}$, would reduce the half-life of the pMHC-II complex on the cell surface. This diminishes the duration and strength of the signal delivered to helper T cells, potentially leading to a weaker adaptive immune response.\n\nIn both pathways, the magnitude of $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{diss}}$ ($-5.935\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$) quantifies a significant loss in binding energy, consistent with a mutation at an important anchor residue that compromises the stability and, consequently, the immunogenicity of the presented peptide.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-5.935}\n$$", "id": "2833563"}, {"introduction": "Once a pMHC complex reaches the cell surface, its lifespan dictates the window of opportunity for T cell recognition.

We can separate the variables $N$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{N} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state at time $t=0$ to a state at an arbitrary time $t>0$.

Thus, we have the expression for $f(t)$:\n$$\nf(t) = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nNext, we must determine the rate constant $k$ from the given half-life, $t_{1/2} = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$. By definition of half-life, at $t = t_{1/2}$, the number of complexes is half the initial number, $N(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{N(0)}{2}$.

The activation of a naive T lymphocyte—either a $\\text{CD8}^+$ cytotoxic T cell recognizing a peptide on MHC-I or a $\\text{CD4}^+$ helper T cell recognizing a peptide on MHC-II—requires the T cell receptor (TCR) to engage a sufficient density of its specific cognate peptide-MHC complex. This engagement must be sustained over a period of time to trigger a full activation signal.\n\nOur calculation shows that after $t=12\\,\\mathrm{h}$, which is two half-lives, only $25\\%$ of the original complexes remain. After $t=24\\,\\mathrm{h}$, or four half-lives, this number drops to a mere $6.25\\%$ ($1/16$) of the initial density. This rapid decay imposes a strict temporal window of opportunity for effective T cell activation. An APC is most potent shortly after it has processed and presented antigen. If a T cell with the correct TCR specificity does not encounter the APC within this timeframe, the density of the relevant peptide-MHC complexes may fall below the threshold required for stable TCR ligation and signal transduction.\n\nThis kinetic constraint is a fundamental regulatory mechanism. It ensures that immune responses are mounted against current, active threats and are not unduly sustained in response to antigens that have already been cleared. The continuous turnover of peptide-MHC complexes forces the immune system to constantly re-sample the antigenic environment, limiting the duration of T cell-APC interactions and preventing chronic, potentially auto-reactive or damaging, inflammatory responses. The half-life of a given peptide-MHC complex is therefore a critical parameter that helps shape the dynamics and magnitude of the adaptive immune response.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{16} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2833531"}]}
