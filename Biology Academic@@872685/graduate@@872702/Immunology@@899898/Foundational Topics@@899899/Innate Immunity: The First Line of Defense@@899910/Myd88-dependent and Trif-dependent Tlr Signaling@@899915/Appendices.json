This specificity is encoded in the molecular details of protein-protein interfaces. This exercise challenges you to apply fundamental principles of structural biology to a model of the TLR4 TIR domain, predicting how a specific mutation impacts adaptor binding and, consequently, signaling outcomes. [@problem_id:2873685]", "problem": "A Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptor engages two signaling branches upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation: a Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent branch from the plasma membrane and a TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-$\\beta$ (TRIF)-dependent branch from endosomes. Sorting adaptors specify these branches by docking their Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains onto the cytosolic TIR domain of TLR4: TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) for the MyD88-dependent branch and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) for the TRIF-dependent branch. A well-supported structural base for TIR–TIR recognition is that the conserved TIR “BB loop” forms a protruding interaction hot spot whose local chemistry and shape strongly influence adaptor binding; protein–protein affinity arises from shape complementarity, electrostatic interactions (e.g., salt bridges), and hydrophobic contacts, with favorable contacts lowering the binding free energy $\\Delta G$.\n\nA computational docking and molecular dynamics analysis of the TLR4–adaptor interfaces proposes the following: in the wild-type receptor, a glutamate ($\\mathrm{Glu}$) side chain within the TLR4 BB loop forms a persistent salt bridge with a lysine ($\\mathrm{Lys}$) in the TIRAP TIR domain, and an adjacent hydrophobic patch on the BB loop packs against a leucine-rich surface of the TRAM TIR domain. You engineer a TLR4 BB-loop point mutation that reverses the charge at this glutamate position, substituting it with lysine (an $\\mathrm{Glu}\\to\\mathrm{Lys}$ change). Assume no changes in receptor trafficking or membrane localization of adaptors (e.g., phosphatidylinositol-$4,5$-bisphosphate, $\\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$, binding by TIRAP and myristoylation by TRAM remain intact); only the TIR–TIR interface is altered by the mutation.\n\nBased solely on the structural interaction model above and first principles of protein–protein recognition (electrostatics, hydrophobic effect, and shape complementarity), which outcome is the most plausible for adaptor recruitment and downstream signaling upon LPS stimulation?\n\nA. The mutation will preferentially impair TIRAP recruitment at the plasma membrane by eliminating the favorable salt bridge and introducing electrostatic repulsion, markedly attenuating MyD88-dependent nuclear factor $\\kappa$B (NF-$\\kappa$B) activation, while TRAM recruitment and TRIF-dependent interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation are relatively preserved.\n\nB. The mutation will preferentially impair TRAM recruitment from endosomes because TRAM depends on a positively charged patch in the TLR4 BB loop; TIRAP recruitment is preserved due to redundancy in salt bridge partners.\n\nC. The mutation will equally abolish recruitment of both TIRAP and TRAM because any BB-loop charge change disrupts the universal BB-loop “kink” necessary for all TIR–TIR interactions.\n\nD. The mutation will suppress TIRAP recruitment but enhance TRAM recruitment because the added positive charge on the BB loop strengthens TRAM binding, yielding reduced NF-$\\kappa$B but superinduced IRF3-dependent gene expression.", "solution": "We begin from the structural principles and core definitions relevant to TIR–TIR interactions.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Toll-like receptor (TLR) cytosolic Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains recruit adaptor TIR domains via interfaces in which the conserved “BB loop” acts as a protruding element that makes key contacts.\n- Protein–protein affinity is governed by shape complementarity, electrostatics (e.g., salt bridges between oppositely charged groups contributing favorably to binding free energy $\\Delta G<0$), and hydrophobic interactions (burying nonpolar surface area, also decreasing $\\Delta G$).\n- Eliminating a salt bridge removes a favorable electrostatic term; introducing a like-charge at the same site creates electrostatic repulsion, both increasing $\\Delta G$ (weakened binding). Altering a residue in or near a hydrophobic patch can weaken packing, but the effect depends on whether the mutated position is directly within the hydrophobic contact surface.\n\nScenario-specific structural model:\n- In wild-type TLR4, the BB loop presents a glutamate ($\\mathrm{Glu}$) that forms a salt bridge with a lysine ($\\mathrm{Lys}$) in TIRAP. This is a direct, specific electrostatic stabilizer of TLR4–TIRAP binding.\n- TRAM binds to a leucine-rich hydrophobic surface that packs against a hydrophobic patch adjacent to the same BB loop. The docking model indicates TRAM’s key stabilization arises from hydrophobic packing rather than the specific glutamate–lysine salt bridge.\n\nEngineered mutation:\n- $\\mathrm{Glu}\\to\\mathrm{Lys}$ at the BB loop reverses the local charge: a negatively charged side chain is replaced by a positively charged one. Consequences:\n  - For TIRAP: the original favorable salt bridge (negative on TLR4 to positive on TIRAP) is lost. Moreover, replacing $\\mathrm{Glu}$ with $\\mathrm{Lys}$ creates a positive group facing the $\\mathrm{Lys}$ on TIRAP, introducing like-charge repulsion. Both removal of a favorable interaction and addition of a repulsive one raise $\\Delta G$ and reduce affinity, possibly substantially.\n  - For TRAM: the principal stabilization is hydrophobic packing against an adjacent patch. Introducing $\\mathrm{Lys}$ at the position formerly occupied by $\\mathrm{Glu}$ changes local polarity and charge. If this side chain is not a dominant contributor to the hydrophobic contact, the effect on TRAM binding is secondary compared to the salt bridge disruption in TIRAP. The hydrophobic patch may remain largely intact; however, the local increase in polarity could slightly reduce packing efficiency or desolvation, moderately weakening TRAM binding at most. Critically, there is no clear mechanism by which a BB-loop positive charge would strengthen the TRAM interface if it is hydrophobically driven.\n\nGiven these principles, a preferential loss of TIRAP recruitment is predicted, with relatively preserved TRAM recruitment, translating into reduced MyD88-dependent NF-$\\kappa$B activation and comparatively intact TRIF-dependent IRF3 signaling after endocytosis.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. States that TIRAP recruitment is preferentially impaired due to loss of the salt bridge and addition of repulsion, blunting MyD88 signaling, while TRAM/TRIF is relatively preserved. This matches the direct application of the structural model and interaction energetics: the TIRAP interface directly depends on the glutamate–lysine salt bridge, whereas TRAM relies on hydrophobic packing adjacent to, but not dominated by, that acidic side chain. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Claims preferential impairment of TRAM because TRAM depends on a positively charged BB loop; this contradicts the given model, which specifies TRAM’s reliance on hydrophobic complementarity, not on a positive charge at that location. It also asserts TIRAP recruitment is preserved by “redundancy in salt bridge partners,” which is speculative and conflicts with the model that emphasizes a specific, persistent salt bridge to TIRAP’s lysine. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Asserts equal abolition of both pathways because any BB-loop charge change disrupts a universal “kink.” The mutation described is a charge reversal ($\\mathrm{Glu}\\to\\mathrm{Lys}$), not a proline substitution that would flatten the BB-loop kink. While the BB loop is structurally important, the specific predicted effect depends on the nature and role of the residue. The model points to a selective electrostatic dependency for TIRAP, not an indiscriminate structural collapse affecting both adaptors equally. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Proposes suppression of TIRAP but enhancement of TRAM via the added positive charge, leading to superinduced TRIF signaling. There is no mechanistic basis in the model for a positive charge to strengthen a hydrophobic, leucine-mediated interface; indeed, adding a polar, charged side chain where hydrophobic packing is beneficial tends to weaken, not strengthen, such interactions. Thus, while the TIRAP suppression component is plausible, the TRAM enhancement is not.

The edited human monocyte-derived macrophages express endogenous levels of all Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway components, including TLR4, CD14, myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-$\\beta$ (TRIF), and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP, also known as Mal). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is applied as a single pulse, and downstream readouts are measured at early and late time points.\n\nFoundational facts:\n- Pattern recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) couples ligand binding to recruitment of cytosolic adaptor proteins that initiate signaling cascades. TLR4 can initiate two branches:\n  - A myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent branch, scaffolded by TIRAP at the plasma membrane, that activates nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-$\\kappa$B) and activator protein 1 (AP-1), inducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).\n  - A Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-$\\beta$ (TRIF)-dependent branch that requires endocytosis of TLR4 and assembly of a TRAM–TRIF complex on endosomal membranes to activate tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), and type I interferons such as interferon-$\\beta$ (IFN-$\\beta$), as well as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as CXCL10.\n- N-terminal glycine myristoylation serves as a membrane-targeting modification that is required for stable association of certain adaptor proteins with the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes.\n\nIn the engineered cells, the following measurements are made after LPS stimulation: early nuclear translocation of NF-$\\kappa$B p65, phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, and mRNA induction of IFN-$\\beta$, CXCL10, and TNF.

Early NF-$\\kappa$B p65 nuclear translocation and TNF induction remain comparable to wild-type, whereas TBK1/IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-$\\beta$/CXCL10 transcripts are markedly reduced.\n\nB. Both NF-$\\kappa$B and IRF3 activation are abolished, with near-complete loss of TNF, IFN-$\\beta$, and CXCL10 due to failure of TLR4 endocytosis.\n\nC. LPS-induced IFN-$\\beta$ and CXCL10 are unchanged because TIRAP compensates for the loss of TRAM myristoylation in recruiting TRIF to TLR4.\n\nD.

The G2A mutation in TRAM prevents this lipid modification, which is essential for anchoring it to cellular membranes. As a result, the mutant TRAM protein becomes a soluble cytosolic protein, unable to localize to the endosomal membrane where the second phase of TLR4 signaling occurs.\n\nThe TRIF-dependent pathway is initiated from endosomes and critically requires TRAM to act as a sorting adaptor, bridging the endocytosed TLR4 receptor to the cytosolic adaptor TRIF. Without membrane-anchored TRAM, this connection is broken. Consequently, TRIF is not recruited, and the entire downstream cascade—including the activation (phosphorylation) of TBK1 and IRF3 and the transcription of IFN-β and CXCL10—is abrogated.\n\nIn contrast, the MyD88-dependent pathway is initiated at the plasma membrane immediately after LPS stimulation. This pathway uses a different sorting adaptor, TIRAP, which is unaffected by the TRAM mutation. Therefore, the early activation of NF-κB (measured by p65 translocation) and the subsequent induction of TNF expression will proceed normally.\n\nThis leads to a specific defect in the TRIF-dependent arm of signaling while leaving the MyD88-dependent arm intact.
