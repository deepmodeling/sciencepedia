It is scientifically grounded, employing the law of mass action for receptor-ligand kinetics and the Hill equation for modeling dose-response phenomena, both of which are standard and fundamental tools in biochemistry and systems biology. The immunological context is sound. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of definitions and parameters that permits the derivation of a unique, physically meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution requires two sequential tasks: first, the derivation of the receptor occupancy fraction $\\theta$, and second, the numerical computation of the inflammatory bias $\\rho$.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for $\\theta$ in terms of the total ligand concentration $L$, total receptor concentration $R_t$, and the dissociation constant $K_d$. We begin with the definition of the dissociation constant:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L_{\\mathrm{free}}]}{[C]}$$\nThe concentrations of free receptor $[R]$ and free ligand $[L_{\\mathrm{free}}]$ are expressed using the conservation laws:\n$$[R] = R_t - [C]$$\n$$[L_{\\mathrm{free}}] = L - [C]$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $K_d$ yields:\n$$K_d = \\frac{(R_t - [C])(L - [C])}{[C]}$$\nThis equation is rearranged into a quadratic equation for the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex $[C]$:\n$$K_d[C] = R_t L - R_t [C] - L[C] + [C]^2$$\n$$[C]^2 - (L + R_t + K_d)[C] + L R_t = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$ with $x = [C]$, $a = 1$, $b = -(L + R_t + K_d)$, and $c = L R_t$. The solution for $[C]$ is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$[C] = \\frac{(L + R_t + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{(L + R_t + K_d)^2 - 4L R_t}}{2}$$\nThe concentration of the complex, $[C]$, cannot exceed the total concentrations of either the receptor, $R_t$, or the ligand, $L$. The root with the plus sign would lead to a non-physical result where $[C] > R_t$ and $[C] > L$. Therefore, we must select the root with the minus sign to ensure a physically meaningful concentration:\n$$[C] = \\frac{(L + R_t + K_d) - \\sqrt{(L + R_t + K_d)^2 - 4L R_t}}{2}$$\nThe receptor occupancy fraction $\\theta$ is defined as $\\theta = \\frac{[C]}{R_t}$. Substituting the expression for $[C]$ gives the final derived form for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{(L + R_t + K_d) - \\sqrt{(L + R_t + K_d)^2 - 4L R_t}}{2R_t}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\rho$. We begin by calculating $\\theta$ using the provided parameter values: $L = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $R_t = 2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, and $K_d = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. For dimensional consistency, we can perform calculations using the numerical values, as all concentrations are given in nM.\n$$[C] = \\frac{(5 + 2 + 1) - \\sqrt{(5 + 2 + 1)^2 - 4(5)(2)}}{2} = \\frac{8 - \\sqrt{64 - 40}}{2} = \\frac{8 - \\sqrt{24}}{2} = 4 - \\sqrt{6}\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nThen, the receptor occupancy fraction $\\theta$ is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[C]}{R_t} = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{6}}{2} = 2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}$$\nNumerically, $\\theta \\approx 0.775255$.\n\nWe now calculate the gene expression levels for TNF and IL-10.\nFor TNF, with parameters $n=3$, $\\theta_{50,\\mathrm{TNF}}=0.4$, $E_{b,\\mathrm{TNF}}=0.05$, $E_{\\max,\\mathrm{TNF}}=1.0$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(\\theta) = 0.05 + (1.0 - 0.05)\\frac{\\theta^3}{\\theta^3 + (0.4)^3} = 0.05 + 0.95 \\frac{(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2})^3}{(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2})^3 + 0.064}$$\nUsing the numerical value of $\\theta$, we find $\\theta^3 \\approx (0.775255)^3 \\approx 0.466033$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{TNF}} \\approx 0.05 + 0.95 \\frac{0.466033}{0.466033 + 0.064} \\approx 0.05 + 0.95 (0.879256) \\approx 0.05 + 0.835293 \\approx 0.885293$$\n\nFor IL-10, with parameters $m=2$, $\\theta_{50,\\mathrm{IL10}}=0.2$, $E_{b,\\mathrm{IL10}}=0.02$, $E_{\\max,\\mathrm{IL10}}=0.8$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{IL10}}(\\theta) = 0.02 + (0.8 - 0.02)\\frac{\\theta^2}{\\theta^2 + (0.2)^2} = 0.02 + 0.78 \\frac{(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2})^2}{(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2})^2 + 0.04}$$\nWe find $\\theta^2 = (2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2})^2 = 4 - 2\\sqrt{6} + \\frac{6}{4} = 5.5 - 2\\sqrt{6} \\approx 0.601021$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{IL10}} \\approx 0.02 + 0.78 \\frac{0.601021}{0.601021 + 0.04} \\approx 0.02 + 0.78 (0.937600) \\approx 0.02 + 0.731328 \\approx 0.751328$$\n\nFinally, we compute the inflammatory bias $\\rho$ as the ratio of the two expression levels:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(\\theta)}{E_{\\mathrm{IL10}}(\\theta)} \\approx \\frac{0.885293}{0.751328} \\approx 1.178298$$\nThe problem requires the answer rounded to four significant figures.
