In a simplified, single-attempt-per-allele model, assume the following well-established features of the recombination mechanism:\n\n1. Recombination requires pairing (synapsis) of recombination signal sequences (RSS). Let the probability that a given allele establishes correct synapsis be $p_{s}$.\n2. Conditional on synapsis, recombination activating gene (RAG) nuclease generates a double-strand break (RSS cleavage). Let the probability that cleavage occurs, given synapsis, be $p_{c}$.\n3. The coding joint, if formed, has a one-in-three chance of being in-frame. Let the frame usage probability be $p_{f} = \\frac{1}{3}$, consistent with equiprobable reading frames.\n\nAssume independence of the above events on a given allele and independence across alleles. Also assume perfect feedback inhibition via the pre-TCR checkpoint: the second allele only attempts recombination if and only if the first allele fails to produce a productive (in-frame) rearrangement. Each allele can be tried at most once.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and the definition of independence in probability theory, derive a closed-form analytical expression for the probability that the cell achieves at least one productive TCR $\\beta$ rearrangement after allowing biallelic attempts with feedback inhibition. Express your final answer as a function of $p_{s}$ and $p_{c}$ with $p_{f} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression with no units.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is deemed valid.\n\nThe givens are as follows:\n- The probability of correct synapsis for a given allele is $p_s$.\n- The probability of RAG nuclease cleavage, conditional on synapsis, is $p_c$.\n- The probability of an in-frame coding joint, conditional on joint formation, is $p_f = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- All events (synapsis, cleavage, framing) are independent on a given allele, in the sense of a sequential process.\n- Recombination events are independent across the two alleles.\n- Biallelic recombination occurs with perfect feedback inhibition: the second allele is attempted if and only if the first allele fails.\n- Each allele is attempted at most once.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular immunology, specifically V(D)J recombination and allelic exclusion. The setup is well-posed, self-contained, and uses objective, formalizable language. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the total probability of achieving at least one productive T cell receptor (TCR) $\\beta$ chain rearrangement.\n\nFirst, let us determine the probability of a productive rearrangement on a single allele. Let this probability be denoted by $P_{success}$. A productive rearrangement requires a sequence of three dependent events to occur: correct synapsis, subsequent cleavage, and finally, the formation of an in-frame coding joint.\n\nLet $E_s$ be the event of correct synapsis. The probability is given as $P(E_s) = p_s$.\nLet $E_c$ be the event of RAG-mediated cleavage. The probability is given as conditional on synapsis: $P(E_c | E_s) = p_c$.\nLet $E_f$ be the event that the resulting joint is in-frame. The formation of a joint requires that both synapsis and cleavage have occurred. The probability of an in-frame joint is given as conditional on its formation: $P(E_f | E_s \\cap E_c) = p_f = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe probability of a successful, productive rearrangement on a single allele, $P_{success}$, is the probability of the intersection of these three events, $P(E_s \\cap E_c \\cap E_f)$. Using the chain rule for probabilities:\n$$P_{success} = P(E_s \\cap E_c \\cap E_f) = P(E_f | E_s \\cap E_c) \\times P(E_c | E_s) \\times P(E_s)$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n$$P_{success} = p_f \\cdot p_c \\cdot p_s$$\nGiven $p_f = \\frac{1}{3}$:\n$$P_{success} = \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c$$\n\nNow, we must consider the process of biallelic recombination with feedback inhibition. The cell has two chances to achieve a productive rearrangement: on the first allele, and if that fails, on the second allele. Let $P_{total}$ be the total probability of success.\n\nThe event of achieving at least one productive rearrangement is the complement of the event where both allelic attempts fail. It is often simpler to calculate the probability of total failure and subtract it from $1$.\n\nLet $F_1$ be the event that the first allele fails to produce a productive rearrangement. The probability of this event is:\n$$P(F_1) = 1 - P_{success} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c$$\n\nAccording to the problem's rule of feedback inhibition, the second allele is attempted only if the first one fails. Let $F_2$ be the event that the second allele fails. The probability of failure for the second allele, given that it is attempted, is the same as for the first, due to the stated independence across alleles:\n$$P(F_2) = 1 - P_{success} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c$$\n\nThe total failure of the thymocyte to produce a productive TCR $\\beta$ chain is the event that the first allele fails AND the second allele fails ($F_1 \\cap F_2$). Since the attempt on the second allele is contingent on the failure of the first, and the intrinsic outcomes are independent, the probability of total failure is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{total failure}) = P(F_1) \\times P(F_2) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right)^2$$\n\nThe probability of at least one success, $P_{total}$, is therefore $1$ minus the probability of total failure:\n$$P_{total} = 1 - P(\\text{total failure}) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right)^2$$\n\nTo obtain the final expression, we expand the squared term:\n$$P_{total} = 1 - \\left(1 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} p_s p_c\\right)^2\\right)$$\n$$P_{total} = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3} p_s p_c + \\frac{1}{9} p_s^2 p_c^2\\right)$$\n$$P_{total} = 1 - 1 + \\frac{2}{3} p_s p_c - \\frac{1}{9} p_s^2 p_c^2$$\n$$P_{total} = \\frac{2}{3} p_s p_c - \\frac{1}{9} p_s^2 p_c^2$$\n\nThis expression represents the probability that the cell achieves at least one productive TCR $\\beta$ rearrangement, derived strictly from the given premises and fundamental principles of probability theory. This can also be factored as $p_s p_c \\left(\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{9} p_s p_c\\right)$.

Prediction: For Pair $X$, the dwell-time model predicts stronger positive selection readouts for APL-$X_2$ than APL-$X_1$, whereas the receptor-occupancy model predicts no difference. For Pair $Y$, the dwell-time model predicts no difference between APL-$Y_1$ and APL-$Y_2$, whereas the receptor-occupancy model predicts stronger readouts for APL-$Y_1$ than APL-$Y_2$. As a control, titrate $[L]$ within each pair to equalize $\\theta$; the receptor-occupancy model predicts convergence of outcomes at matched $\\theta$, whereas the dwell-time model predicts that ranking by $\\tau$ persists despite equalized $\\theta$.**\n\nThis option correctly describes the experimental design. It correctly identifies which parameters are held constant and which are varied in each pair. The predictions stated for both models and both pairs directly match the logical derivations above:\n- Pair X: Dwell-time model predicts $X_2 > X_1$; Receptor-occupancy model predicts $X_2 = X_1$. The option states this correctly.\n- Pair Y: Dwell-time model predicts $Y_1 = Y_2$; Receptor-occupancy model predicts $Y_1 > Y_2$. The option states this correctly.\nThe proposed control experiment of titrating $[L]$ to match $\\theta$ (which would be most relevant when comparing ligands with different $K_D$ values, such as APL-$Y_1$ and APL-$Y_2$) and its predicted outcomes are also logically sound based on the definitions of the models. The entire statement is a correct and complete description of a rigorous experiment to distinguish the hypotheses.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Use Pair $X$ at fixed $[L]$ to hold $K_D$ constant and conclude that neither model predicts differences, because $K_D$ determines both $\\tau$ and $\\theta$. Then use Pair $Y$ and predict that the receptor-occupancy model favors APL-$Y_2$ (higher $K_D$) due to faster $k_{\\text{on}}$, whereas the dwell-time model favors APL-$Y_1$ due to slower $k_{\\text{off}}$.**\n\nThis option contains multiple fundamental errors.\n1. The premise \"$K_D$ determines both $\\tau$ and $\\theta$\" is false. $K_D = k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$ and $\\tau = 1/k_{\\text{off}}$, so $K_D$ does not uniquely determine $\\tau$. Pair $X$ is a direct counterexample where $K_D$ is constant but $\\tau$ differs by an order of magnitude.\n2. The conclusion for Pair X that \"neither model predicts differences\" is false for the dwell-time model, which predicts a strong difference based on $\\tau$.\n3. The prediction for Pair Y that the receptor-occupancy model favors APL-$Y_2$ is false. Higher $K_D$ means lower affinity and thus lower occupancy $\\theta$ at a given $[L]$. The model would favor APL-$Y_1$. Furthermore, the reason given, \"faster $k_{\\text{on}}$,\" is factually incorrect; APL-$Y_2$ has a slower $k_{\\text{on}}$ ($10^{4}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$) than APL-$Y_1$ ($10^{5}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$).\n4. The prediction for Pair Y that the dwell-time model favors APL-$Y_1$ is false. The dwell times are identical for Pair Y, so this model predicts no difference.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Compare any APL with short $\\tau$ to one with long $\\tau$ at very high $[L]$; if positive selection becomes equivalent at high $[L]$, then dwell time is not primary, whereas if differences persist at high $[L]$, dwell time is primary. No control for $K_D$ is needed because increasing $[L]$ can always compensate for kinetic differences.**\n\nThis option describes a scientifically weak approach.\n1. The idea of comparing \"any APL\" without controlling for other parameters like $K_D$ is poor experimental design. The power of the APL system lies in the precise control offered by pairs like $X$ and $Y$.\n2. The statement that \"No control for $K_D$ is needed\" is careless and wrong. A a robust conclusion requires isolating variables.\n3. The justification \"increasing $[L]$ can always compensate for kinetic differences\" is a gross oversimplification. Increasing $[L]$ to saturation ($[L] \\gg K_D$) can equalize occupancy near $\\theta \\approx 1$, but it cannot \"compensate\" for an intrinsic difference in dwell time ($\\tau$). While the logic of testing at saturation has some merit (it tests if differences persist when $\\theta$ is equalized at its maximum), this option dismisses the necessity of controlled comparisons, which is a major flaw. It is an inferior strategy compared to the one outlined in A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Rank APLs solely by $K_D$ regardless of $k_{\\text{on}}$ or $k_{\\text{off}}$, and predict that both models yield the same ordering of positive selection outcomes across all conditions. Therefore, no test that varies $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ independently is necessary or informative.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally misguided.\n1. The a priori assumption that both models yield the same ordering is demonstrably false. For Pair $X$, the $K_D$ values are identical. The receptor-occupancy model predicts equal outcomes ($X_1 = X_2$), while the dwell-time model predicts a strong preference for $X_2$ ($X_2 > X_1$). The orderings are different.\n2. The conclusion that \"no test that varies $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ independently is necessary or informative\" contradicts the entire premise of the problem and the scientific method in this field. Such tests are precisely the tool required to distinguish between hypotheses that depend on different combinations of these rate constants.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nThe only option that proposes a valid experimental design and correctly interprets the predicted outcomes according to the stated hypotheses is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2893354"}, {"introduction": "A central outcome of thymic selection is the commitment of a double-positive thymocyte to either the CD4 helper or CD8 cytotoxic lineage.

Now consider a perturbation that reduces the effective Lck association with CD8 by a multiplicative factor $s = 0.5$ (so that $\\alpha_{8}$ is replaced by $\\alpha_{8}' = s \\alpha_{8}$), without changing $\\alpha_{4}$.\n\nUsing only the assumptions above and general probability laws, derive an expression for the post-perturbation population CD4:CD8 ratio among mature T cells and evaluate it numerically for the provided parameters. Round your final ratio to four significant figures and express it as a unitless decimal.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a straightforward application of probability theory to a simplified biophysical model of T cell development. We will proceed with a formal derivation of the solution.\n\nLet $C_4$ denote the event that a thymocyte commits to the CD4 lineage, and $C_8$ the event of commitment to the CD8 lineage. The decision is based on the continuous signaling duration $T$. The commitment rules are:\n- CD4 commitment: $T \\ge T_{c}$\n- CD8 commitment: $T < T_{c}$\n\nThe thymocyte population consists of two subpopulations: a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{II}}$ that are MHC class II restricted and use the CD4 co-receptor, and a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{I}}$ that are MHC class I restricted and use the CD8 co-receptor. For these populations, the signaling duration $T$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameters $\\lambda_4$ and $\\lambda_8$, respectively.\n\nThe probability density function for an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$ is $p(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$. The corresponding cumulative distribution function is $F(t) = P(T \\le t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, and the survival function is $S(t) = P(T > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. As $T$ is a continuous variable, $P(T \\ge T_c) = P(T > T_c)$.\n\nFor the MHC class II restricted subpopulation, the probabilities of lineage commitment are:\n- Probability of CD4 commitment: $P(C_4 | M_{\\mathrm{II}}) = P(T_4 \\ge T_{c}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_{c})$\n- Probability of CD8 commitment: $P(C_8 | M_{\\mathrm{II}}) = P(T_4 < T_{c}) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_{c})$\n\nFor the MHC class I restricted subpopulation, the probabilities are:\n- Probability of CD4 commitment: $P(C_4 | M_{\\mathrm{I}}) = P(T_8 \\ge T_{c}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_8 T_{c})$\n- Probability of CD8 commitment: $P(C_8 | M_{\\mathrm{I}}) = P(T_8 < T_{c}) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_8 T_{c})$\n\nThe problem introduces a perturbation that modifies the Lck association with CD8 via a factor $s = 0.5$. The parameter $\\alpha_8$ becomes $\\alpha_8' = s \\alpha_8$. The signaling rates are given by $\\lambda_i = \\lambda_0 / \\alpha_i$. Thus, the post-perturbation rates are:\n- $\\lambda_4 = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\alpha_4}$ (unchanged)\n- $\\lambda_8' = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\alpha_8'} = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{s \\alpha_8}$\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall fraction of mature cells in each lineage is the weighted sum of the contributions from each subpopulation. Let $N_{CD4}$ be the number of mature CD4 cells and $N_{CD8}$ be the number of mature CD8 cells from a total population of $N$ selecting thymocytes.\nThe total number of CD4 cells is:\n$$N_{CD4} = N \\times P(C_4) = N \\left( f_{\\mathrm{II}} P(C_4 | M_{\\mathrm{II}}) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} P(C_4 | M_{\\mathrm{I}}) \\right)$$\n$$N_{CD4} = N \\left( f_{\\mathrm{II}} \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_c) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} \\exp(-\\lambda_8' T_c) \\right)$$\nThe total number of CD8 cells is:\n$$N_{CD8} = N \\times P(C_8) = N \\left( f_{\\mathrm{II}} P(C_8 | M_{\\mathrm{II}}) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} P(C_8 | M_{\\mathrm{I}}) \\right)$$\n$$N_{CD8} = N \\left( f_{\\mathrm{II}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_c)) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_8' T_c)) \\right)$$\n\nThe CD4:CD8 ratio, denoted by $R$, is the ratio of the total number of CD4 cells to the total number of CD8 cells. The factor $N$ cancels.\n$$R = \\frac{N_{CD4}}{N_{CD8}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{II}} \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_c) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} \\exp(-\\lambda_8' T_c)}{f_{\\mathrm{II}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_4 T_c)) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_8' T_c))}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates in terms of the given parameters:\n$$R = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{II}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{\\alpha_4}\\right) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{s \\alpha_8}\\right)}{f_{\\mathrm{II}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{\\alpha_4}\\right)\\right) + f_{\\mathrm{I}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{s \\alpha_8}\\right)\\right)}$$\nThis is the general expression for the post-perturbation CD4:CD8 ratio.\n\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values: $f_{\\mathrm{I}} = 0.6$, $f_{\\mathrm{II}} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{0} = 0.6 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}$, $T_{c} = 5.0 \\, \\text{min}$, $\\alpha_{4} = 3.0$, $\\alpha_{8} = 1.0$, and $s = 0.5$.\n\nFirst, we compute the exponents for the exponential functions:\n- For the MHC class II restricted group (using $\\alpha_4$):\n$$-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{\\alpha_4} = -\\frac{0.6 \\times 5.0}{3.0} = -\\frac{3.0}{3.0} = -1.0$$\n- For the MHC class I restricted group (using $\\alpha_8'$):\n$$-\\frac{\\lambda_0 T_c}{s \\alpha_8} = -\\frac{0.6 \\times 5.0}{0.5 \\times 1.0} = -\\frac{3.0}{0.5} = -6.0$$\n\nNext, we substitute these values into the expression for the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{0.4 \\exp(-1.0) + 0.6 \\exp(-6.0)}{0.4 (1 - \\exp(-1.0)) + 0.6 (1 - \\exp(-6.0))}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the expression numerically:\nThe exponential terms are:\n$\\exp(-1.0) \\approx 0.367879$\n$\\exp(-6.0) \\approx 0.002479$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$N_R = (0.4 \\times 0.367879) + (0.6 \\times 0.002479) \\approx 0.147152 + 0.001487 = 0.148639$\n\nThe denominator is:\n$D_R = 0.4 \\times (1 - 0.367879) + 0.6 \\times (1 - 0.002479)$\n$D_R = (0.4 \\times 0.632121) + (0.6 \\times 0.997521) \\approx 0.252848 + 0.598513 = 0.851361$\n\nThe final ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{0.148639}{0.851361} \\approx 0.174599$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $R = 0.1746$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1746}$$", "id": "2893263"}]}
