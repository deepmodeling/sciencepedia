This first practice explores the probabilistic nature of V(D)J recombination, where random nucleotide insertions can disrupt the genetic reading frame. By applying basic probability theory, you will calculate how the strategy of attempting rearrangement on two separate alleles—a process known as allelic exclusion—dramatically enhances the overall probability of a cell successfully producing a functional heavy chain and passing this fundamental checkpoint [@problem_id:2835592].", "problem": "In developing B lymphocytes, immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement proceeds through attempted recombination events that generate a contiguous variable region exon, which will be translated only if the rearranged coding sequence preserves the triplet reading frame. From the Central Dogma (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), translation reads nucleotide triplets, so frameshifted sequences are nonproductive. Empirical observations of random nucleotide addition and deletion at coding joints during V(D)J recombination support modeling the reading frame offset modulo three as approximately uniformly distributed; thus, under random junctional diversity, the probability that a completed heavy chain rearrangement yields an in-frame coding sequence is $1/3$ per attempt.\n\nConsider a simplified, yet biologically realistic, checkpoint model of pro-B cells:\n- Each cell can make at most two independent heavy chain rearrangement attempts, one on each allele, in sequence.\n- If the first attempt is in-frame, allelic exclusion halts further rearrangement; if the first attempt is out-of-frame, the cell proceeds to attempt rearrangement on the second allele.\n- There is no further rescue on an already-attempted allele, and attempts are conditionally independent with identical success probability $1/3$ for being in-frame, reflecting random junctional addition.\n\nStarting from these premises and the probabilistic independence of the two alleles’ attempts, derive the expected proportion of cells that successfully produce at least one in-frame heavy chain rearrangement and thus pass the heavy-chain checkpoint.

The premise that random nucleotide insertions/deletions at the coding joints lead to a $1/3$ probability of an in-frame product is a canonical approximation in immunology. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions specified to calculate a unique probability. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and free of scientific fallacies, logical contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a cell passes the heavy-chain checkpoint. This occurs if at least one of the two possible rearrangement attempts results in an in-frame sequence. Let $p$ denote the probability of a successful in-frame rearrangement for a single attempt. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe probability of a failed (out-of-frame) rearrangement is therefore:\n$$1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nLet $S$ be the event that the cell is successful. According to the model, a cell can achieve success through two mutually exclusive pathways:\n\n1.  The first rearrangement attempt on the first allele is successful. The probability of this event is $p$. Upon this success, the process halts due to allelic exclusion, and no further attempts are made.\n\n2.  The first attempt fails, but the second attempt on the second allele is successful. This is a compound event. The first part is the failure of the first attempt, which has a probability of $1 - p$. The second part is the success of the second attempt, which has a probability of $p$. Since the two attempts are described as independent events, the probability of this entire sequence is the product of their individual probabilities: $(1-p)p$.\n\nThe total probability of success, $P(S)$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two disjoint pathways.\n$$P(S) = (\\text{Probability of success on 1st attempt}) + (\\text{Probability of failure on 1st AND success on 2nd})$$\n$$P(S) = p + (1-p)p$$\nSubstituting the given value of $p = 1/3$ into this expression:\n$$P(S) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$P(S) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$P(S) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $9$.\n$$P(S) = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nAlternatively, we can solve this by calculating the probability of the complementary event: total failure. A cell fails the checkpoint only if both rearrangement attempts are out-of-frame. Let $F$ be the event of total failure.\n$$F = (\\text{Failure on 1st attempt}) \\cap (\\text{Failure on 2nd attempt})$$\nThe probability of this event, due to independence, is:\n$$P(F) = (1-p)(1-p) = (1-p)^2$$\nSubstituting the value of $p$:\n$$P(F) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9}$$\nThe probability of success, $P(S)$, is the complement of the probability of failure.\n$$P(S) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nBoth methods produce the same result, confirming the correctness of the derivation. The expected proportion of cells that successfully pass the checkpoint is equal to this probability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}\n$$", "id": "2835592"}, {"introduction": "Building on the probabilistic outcome of recombination, we now examine the underlying molecular kinetics.
