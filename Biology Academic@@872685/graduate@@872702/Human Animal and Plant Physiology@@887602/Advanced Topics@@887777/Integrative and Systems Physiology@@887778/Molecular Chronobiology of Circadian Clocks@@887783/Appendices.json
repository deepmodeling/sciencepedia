Masking refers to the direct, immediate effects of environmental factors (for example, light intensity and posture) on observed activity, independent of circadian clock phase. Entrainment refers to phase-locking of the endogenous circadian oscillator by periodic zeitgebers (for example, a 24-hour light–dark cycle). In a CR, environmental inputs are held constant and minimal to reduce masking, while the internal oscillator is allowed to free-run. For a sufficiently short CR duration, phase can be treated as unchanged.\n\nDesign a two-condition protocol: (i) a baseline entrained day under a regular 12-hour light–12-hour dark schedule with a fixed sleep–wake schedule and (ii) the first 24 hours of a CR in dim light. Use the following experimental design and modeling assumptions to compute the expected change in 24-hour mean wrist activity attributable to masking removal, assuming no clock phase shift across the 24 hours.\n\nFundamental base and modeling assumptions:\n- The observed activity is modeled as the sum of an endogenous circadian component and additive masking components from light and posture.

Represent light as $L(t)=1$ during lights-on and $L(t)=0$ during lights-off; represent posture/wake as $P(t)=1$ while awake upright and $P(t)=0$ during scheduled sleep.\n- Constant Routine (CR): 24 hours of continuous dim light set to $5\\%$ of the baseline lights-on intensity. Represent this as $L(t)=0.05$ at all times. Participants remain continuously awake in a semi-recumbent position with reduced movement; represent this as $P(t)=0.20$ at all times.

It is scientifically grounded in the known principles of circadian chronobiology and is free of internal contradictions or ambiguities. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in analyzing the dynamics of the Period protein (PER) concentration, which we denote as $P(t)$. The temporal evolution of $P(t)$ is determined by the balance between an input flux, $J(t)$, from transcription and translation, and a first-order removal process. This is expressed by the following ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d P(t)}{dt} = J(t) - k P(t)\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the effective rate constant for PER turnover. The input flux $J(t)$ is a result of a delayed negative feedback loop, meaning it is a functional of the history of $P(t)$.\n\n1) To demonstrate the scaling relationship between the period $T$ and the rate constant $k$, we employ a nondimensionalization argument, as stipulated by the problem. The central premise is that in the specified singular regime, the dynamics are controlled by a single timescale, which is the characteristic time of PER turnover, $1/k$.\n\nLet us define a dimensionless time variable $\\theta$ and a dimensionless concentration $\\tilde{P}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\theta = k t\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{P}(\\theta) = \\frac{P(t)}{P_{\\text{ref}}}\n$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{ref}}$ is a characteristic concentration scale that we will determine.

The problem states that upstream synthesis parameters are unchanged by the mutation affecting $k$. Let us assume the functional form of the feedback, which determines $J$, is independent of $k$ and that $J$ scales with a characteristic synthesis rate, $v_s$. Thus, we can write $J(t)$ as $v_s \\cdot \\mathcal{J}[\\tilde{P}]$, where $\\mathcal{J}$ is a dimensionless functional representing the feedback logic. The equation becomes:\n$$\nk P_{\\text{ref}} \\frac{d\\tilde{P}}{d\\theta} = v_s \\mathcal{J}[\\tilde{P}] - k P_{\\text{ref}} \\tilde{P}\n$$\nDividing by $k P_{\\text{ref}}$ yields the dimensionless dynamical equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{P}}{d\\theta} = \\frac{v_s}{k P_{\\text{ref}}} \\mathcal{J}[\\tilde{P}] - \\tilde{P}\n$$\nThe problem states that \"time can be nondimensionalized by $1/k$ without altering the dimensionless dynamics.\" This requires that the resulting dimensionless equation must be independent of the parameter $k$. For this to hold, the coefficient of the synthesis term, $\\frac{v_s}{k P_{\\text{ref}}}$, must be a constant independent of $k$. We can ensure this by choosing our reference concentration $P_{\\text{ref}}$ to be proportional to $v_s/k$. A natural choice is to set the coefficient to unity, which implies $P_{\\text{ref}} = v_s/k$. This is a physically consistent choice, as it sets the characteristic concentration scale by the balance of production and degradation rates.\n\nWith this choice, the dimensionless equation for the oscillator simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{P}(\\theta)}{d\\theta} = \\mathcal{J}[\\tilde{P}] - \\tilde{P}(\\theta)\n$$\nSince this equation and the functional $\\mathcal{J}$ contain no parameters that depend on $k$, its solution, $\\tilde{P}(\\theta)$, will be a periodic function with a dimensionless period, which we denote as $\\mathcal{T}$, that is a universal constant for this system.\n\nThe dimensional period $T$ is the time it takes for one full oscillation. The corresponding interval in dimensionless time is $\\mathcal{T}$. The relationship between dimensional and dimensionless time is $\\theta = k t$. Therefore, the periods are related by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T} = k T\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\nT = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}}{k}\n$$\nSince $\\mathcal{T}$ is a constant, this demonstrates that the circadian period $T$ is inversely proportional to the effective PER turnover rate constant $k$, i.e., $T \\propto 1/k$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\n2) Now we apply this result to calculate the fractional change in period due to the CK1δ T44A mutation.\nLet the original period and turnover rate be $T$ and $k$, respectively.
