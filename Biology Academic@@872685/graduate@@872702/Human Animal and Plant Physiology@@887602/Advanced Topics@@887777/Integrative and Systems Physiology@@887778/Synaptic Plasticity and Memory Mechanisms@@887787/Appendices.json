A primary mechanism involves increasing the number of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, making the synapse more responsive to glutamate. This exercise challenges you to bridge this molecular change to a measurable electrical outcome by calculating the resulting increase in synaptic conductance and current, grounding the theory of LTP in the fundamental principles of ion channel physics.

During spike-timing dependent long-term potentiation, an additional $10$ GluA1-containing AMPA receptors are inserted into the postsynaptic density at a single synapse. Each inserted receptor has a unitary single-channel conductance of $15$ pS at $-70$ mV and an ensemble-averaged peak open probability of $0.35$ in response to a quantal glutamate transient. Assume the following: (i) AMPA receptor reversal potential is $0$ mV, (ii) inward rectification is negligible at $-70$ mV so that current-voltage behavior is locally ohmic, (iii) channel gating is independent across receptors, (iv) space clamp and series resistance errors are negligible, and (v) the glutamate transient and binding kinetics are unchanged by receptor insertion.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of conductance and current for ligand-gated ion channels and the concept of reversal potential, compute the expected peak increase in ensemble-averaged postsynaptic conductance and the corresponding increase in excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude produced by the insertion of these receptors at $-70$ mV.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of ion channel biophysics and synaptic physiology. The provided data are realistic, and the assumptions serve to create a well-posed problem with a unique, stable solution based on fundamental definitions. The problem is free from ambiguity, contradiction, and factual error. The required calculations are a direct application of first principles.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in conductance and current resulting from the insertion of $N$ new AMPA receptors. This requires calculating the total contribution of these newly added channels.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected peak increase in the ensemble-averaged postsynaptic conductance, denoted as $\\Delta G$. The macroscopic conductance ($G$) of a population of ion channels is the product of the number of channels ($N$), the single-channel conductance ($\\gamma$), and the probability that a channel is in the open state ($P_o$). The assumption of independent gating allows for this simple multiplication. The increase in conductance, $\\Delta G$, is therefore the macroscopic conductance of the newly inserted population of receptors.\n\n$$ \\Delta G = N \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot P_o $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$N = 10$\n$\\gamma = 15 \\text{ pS} = 15 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}$\n$P_o = 0.35$\n\n$$ \\Delta G = 10 \\cdot (15 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\cdot 0.35 $$\n$$ \\Delta G = 150 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S} \\cdot 0.35 $$\n$$ \\Delta G = 52.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S} = 52.5 \\text{ pS} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in nanosiemens (nS). We perform the unit conversion:\n$1 \\text{ nS} = 1000 \\text{ pS}$, so $1 \\text{ pS} = 10^{-3} \\text{ nS}$.\n$$ \\Delta G = 52.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ nS} = 0.0525 \\text{ nS} $$\n\nNext, we compute the corresponding increase in the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude. The current ($I$) flowing through an ensemble of channels is governed by Ohm's law, where the current is the product of the conductance ($G$) and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the reversal potential for the ions passing through the channel ($E_{rev}$).\n\nThe increase in current, $\\Delta I$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta I = \\Delta G \\cdot (V_m - E_{rev}) $$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value for $\\Delta G$ and the given values for the potentials:\n$\\Delta G = 52.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}$\n$V_m = -70 \\text{ mV} = -70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$\n$E_{rev} = 0 \\text{ mV} = 0 \\text{ V}$\n\n$$ \\Delta I = (52.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\cdot (-70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V} - 0 \\text{ V}) $$\n$$ \\Delta I = (52.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\cdot (-70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) $$\n$$ \\Delta I = -3675 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ A} $$\n\nThe result is required in picoamperes (pA).

The problem asks for the \"increase in EPSC amplitude\". In electrophysiology, the amplitude of an inward current is conventionally reported as a positive value representing its magnitude. Therefore, the increase in amplitude is the absolute value of the calculated change in current.\n\nIncrease in EPSC amplitude $= |\\Delta I| = |-3.675 \\text{ pA}| = 3.675 \\text{ pA}$.\n\nThe final step is to round the results to three significant figures as specified.\nThe conductance increase is $\\Delta G = 0.0525 \\text{ nS}$. This value already has three significant figures.\nThe current amplitude increase is $3.675 \\text{ pA}$. Rounded to three significant figures, this becomes $3.68 \\text{ pA}$.\n\nThe final answer is a row vector containing the conductance increase in nS and the current amplitude increase in pA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0525  3.68 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2612697"}, {"introduction": "Synaptic plasticity is not confined to the postsynaptic neuron; changes in presynaptic vesicle release are equally critical.
