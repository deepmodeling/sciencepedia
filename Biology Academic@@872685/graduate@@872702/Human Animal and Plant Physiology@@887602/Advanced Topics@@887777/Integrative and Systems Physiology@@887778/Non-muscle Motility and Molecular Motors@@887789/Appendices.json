This requires the application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics to an isothermal, isobaric process.\n\nThe system under consideration consists of the kinesin motor and one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This system operates in a cellular environment which acts as a heat and pressure reservoir at a constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that the change in the system's internal energy, $d U$, is given by the heat added to the system, $\\delta Q$, and the work done by the system, $\\delta W$:\n$$dU = \\delta Q - \\delta W$$\nThe second law of thermodynamics for a process in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T$ can be expressed as $\\delta Q \\leq T dS$, where $dS$ is the change in the system's entropy. The equality holds for a reversible process, and the inequality for an irreversible one.\n\nCombining the first and second laws, we have $dU + \\delta W \\leq T dS$. The total work done by the system, $\\delta W$, is composed of pressure-volume work, $P dV$, and non-pressure-volume work. In this case, the latter is the mechanical work, $W_{\\text{mech}}$, performed by the motor against an external load. Thus, $\\delta W = P dV + W_{\\text{mech}}$. Substituting this into our inequality yields:\n$$dU + P dV + W_{\\text{mech}} \\leq T dS$$\nRearranging for the mechanical work, we obtain:\n$$W_{\\text{mech}} \\leq T dS - (dU + P dV)$$\nFor a process at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, the change in Gibbs free energy, $dG$, is defined as $dG = dH - T dS$, where $dH = dU + P dV$ is the change in enthalpy. Therefore, $T dS - (dU + P dV) = -dG$. The inequality for the mechanical work becomes:\n$$W_{\\text{mech}} \\leq -dG$$\nFor a finite process, such as one step of the motor fueled by one ATP hydrolysis event, this is written as $W_{\\text{mech}} \\leq -\\Delta G$. This fundamental relationship states that the maximum mechanical work that can be extracted from a process cannot exceed the decrease in the system's Gibbs free energy. This is the criterion for thermodynamic consistency.\n\nFirst, we assess the consistency of the given values.

We place this pivot at the origin $(0,0)$ of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The actin filament lies along the $x$-axis. The position vector $\\vec{r}$ of the distal tip of the lever arm is described in polar coordinates by its length $L$ and its angle $\\theta$ relative to the positive $x$-axis. In Cartesian components, this is:\n$$ \\vec{r}(\\theta) = (L\\cos\\theta, L\\sin\\theta) $$\nThe initial orientation of the lever is given by the angle $\\theta_{0}$. The initial position vector of the tip is thus:\n$$ \\vec{r}_{i} = \\vec{r}(\\theta_{0}) = (L\\cos\\theta_{0}, L\\sin\\theta_{0}) $$\nThe power stroke involves a rotation by an angle $\\Delta\\theta$ toward the positive $x$-direction. For an initial angle $\\theta_0$ in the range $(0, \\pi)$, a rotation toward the positive $x$-axis corresponds to a decrease in the angle $\\theta$. Thus, the final angle $\\theta_{f}$ is given by:\n$$ \\theta_{f} = \\theta_{0} - \\Delta\\theta $$\nThe final position vector of the lever tip is:\n$$ \\vec{r}_{f} = \\vec{r}(\\theta_{f}) = (L\\cos(\\theta_{0} - \\Delta\\theta), L\\sin(\\theta_{0} - \\Delta\\theta)) $$\nThe displacement of the tip during the power stroke is the vector difference $\\vec{s} = \\vec{r}_{f} - \\vec{r}_{i}$.\n$$ \\vec{s} = (L\\cos(\\theta_{0} - \\Delta\\theta) - L\\cos\\theta_{0})\\,\\hat{i} + (L\\sin(\\theta_{0} - \\Delta\\theta) - L\\sin\\theta_{0})\\,\\hat{j} $$\nThe axial displacement, $s_{x}$, is the component of $\\vec{s}$ along the $x$-axis.\n$$ s_{x}(L, \\Delta\\theta, \\theta_{0}) = L\\left( \\cos(\\theta_{0} - \\Delta\\theta) - \\cos\\theta_{0} \\right) $$\nTo obtain a more insightful form, we apply the trigonometric sum-to-product identity: $\\cos A - \\cos B = -2\\sin\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$.

For a given myosin motor, $L$ and $\\Delta\\theta$ are fixed parameters.

The factor $2L\\sin(\\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2})$ is a positive constant.\nMaximization of $s_{x}$ is achieved by maximizing the term $\\sin\\left(\\theta_{0} - \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2}\\right)$. The maximum value of the sine function is $1$, which occurs when its argument is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. We consider the principal value ($k=0$):\n$$ \\theta_{0} - \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nThis gives the optimal initial orientation that yields the maximum stroke:\n$$ \\theta_{0}^{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2} $$\nSubstituting this optimal angle back into the expression for $s_{x}$ gives the maximal axial displacement, $s_{\\max}(L, \\Delta\\theta)$:\n$$ s_{\\max} = 2L\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left( \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2} \\right) = 2L\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\nSince $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ s_{\\max}(L, \\Delta\\theta) = 2L\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2}\\right) $$\nThis expression explicitly shows that the maximal axial displacement, $s_{\\max}$, scales linearly with the lever arm length $L$ and with $\\sin(\\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2})$. The initial orientation that achieves this maximum is $\\theta_{0} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2}$.\n\nPart 3: Calculation for Myosin V and Myosin II\n\nWe are given the lever-arm lengths for Myosin V ($L_{\\mathrm{V}} = 23\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) and Myosin II ($L_{\\mathrm{II}} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), and a common power-stroke angular change of $\\Delta\\theta = 70^{\\circ}$.

A normal, processive hand-over-hand gait requires both heads to cycle through ATP-dependent states of high and low affinity for the microtubule, allowing one head to detach while the other remains anchored.\n\nIn this heterodimer, the wild-type (WT) head can cycle normally, but the CD head is locked in a nucleotide-free, rigor-like state with strong microtubule affinity. For the motor to be processive, the CD head must be able to detach from its binding site to allow the motor to advance.

Under zero load, the intrinsic detachment rate is $k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{0} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which corresponds to a mean waiting time of $1/k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{0} = 1000$ seconds. This is far too slow for any meaningful processive movement.\n\nEven when assisted by force, the rate remains prohibitively low. After one 8 nm step by the WT head, the optical trap exerts a force of $F = k_{\\mathrm{trap}}x = (0.05\\,\\mathrm{pN/nm})(8\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{pN}$.

The force barely accelerates detachment. Even at the theoretical stall force of a single WT head (~7 pN), the detachment time would still be hundreds of seconds.\n\nThis analysis leads to the following conclusions:\n1.  **No Sustained Processivity:** The motor is kinetically trapped by the near-permanent binding of its CD head. Any forward step is transient, as the motor will be stuck for an extremely long time waiting for the CD head to detach.\n2.  **Near-Zero Stall Force:** The motor is incapable of working against any significant load because its own internal kinetics stall its motion after at most one step. The effective stall force is therefore negligible ($\\lesssim 1\\,\\mathrm{pN}$).\n3.  **No Stable Inchworm Gait:** A stable inchworm mechanism still requires the trailing head to detach in a coordinated manner. The inability of the CD head to do so prevents this. The lack of ATP-dependent affinity changes in the CD head breaks the head-head gating necessary for any form of processive movement.\n\nTherefore, the motor will not be processive, any steps will be rare and transient, and the effective stall force will be near zero.
