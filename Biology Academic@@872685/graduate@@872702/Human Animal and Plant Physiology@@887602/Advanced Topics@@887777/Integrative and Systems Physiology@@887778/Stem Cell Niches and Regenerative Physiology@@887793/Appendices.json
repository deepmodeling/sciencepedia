It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We will proceed with the validation and solution.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe given information is as follows:\n- The probability of a specific protein, Yes-associated protein (YAP), localizing to the nucleus, $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E)$, is described as a function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) elastic modulus, $E$.\n- The functional form is a Hill-type equation: $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E) = \\dfrac{E^{n}}{E^{n} + K^{n}}$.\n- The parameter $K$ represents the stiffness at half-maximal activation, given as $K = 5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n- The parameter $n$ is the Hill coefficient, representing cooperativity, given as $n = 3$.\n- The task is to compute $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E)$ for three specific values of stiffness: $E \\in \\{0.5, 5, 50\\}\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n- A subsequent task is to interpret the results in the context of mechanotransduction regimes.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, as the Hill function is a standard model for describing sigmoidal, cooperative processes in biology. The context of mechanotransduction and YAP localization is a well-established area of cell biology research. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and variables defined, leading to a unique set of solutions. The language is objective and precise. There are no violations of scientific principles or logical consistency. We proceed to solve the problem.\n\nThe governing equation is $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E) = \\dfrac{E^{n}}{E^{n} + K^{n}}$.\nSubstituting the given parameters $K=5$ and $n=3$, we obtain the specific form of the function:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E) = \\frac{E^{3}}{E^{3} + 5^{3}} = \\frac{E^{3}}{E^{3} + 125}$$\nWe are required to evaluate this function for three values of $E$.\n\nCase 1: $E = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\nWe substitute $E = 0.5$ into the equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(0.5) = \\frac{(0.5)^{3}}{(0.5)^{3} + 125} = \\frac{0.125}{0.125 + 125} = \\frac{0.125}{125.125}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $1000$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(0.5) = \\frac{125}{125125} = \\frac{125}{125 \\times 1001} = \\frac{1}{1001}$$\n\nCase 2: $E = 5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\nWe substitute $E = 5$ into the equation. This value of $E$ is equal to the parameter $K$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(5) = \\frac{5^{3}}{5^{3} + 5^{3}} = \\frac{125}{125 + 125} = \\frac{125}{250} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAs expected from the definition of $K$, the activation probability is exactly one-half when the stimulus $E$ equals the half-maximal activation constant $K$.\n\nCase 3: $E = 50\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\nWe substitute $E = 50$ into the equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(50) = \\frac{50^{3}}{50^{3} + 125} = \\frac{125000}{125000 + 125} = \\frac{125000}{125125}$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we again factor out $125$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(50) = \\frac{125 \\times 1000}{125 \\times 1001} = \\frac{1000}{1001}$$\n\nNow, we interpret these results in terms of physiological regimes. The behavior of the Hill function is determined by the ratio of the stimulus $E$ to the characteristic stiffness $K$.\n\nRegime 1: Soft-niche. This corresponds to $E \\ll K$.\nOur calculation for $E = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ exemplifies this regime, where $E = 0.1 \\times K$. The resulting probability $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(0.5) = \\frac{1}{1001} \\approx 0.001$. This value is very close to zero, indicating that the YAP mechanotransduction pathway is essentially inactive. In this regime, the system is insensitive to the stimulus.\n\nRegime 2: Transition. This corresponds to $E \\approx K$.\nOur calculation for $E = 5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ lies at the center of this regime, where $E = K$. The probability is $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(5) = \\frac{1}{2}$. The system is in a state of intermediate activation and exhibits the highest sensitivity to fractional changes in stiffness $E$. Small changes in $E$ around $K$ will produce the largest changes in $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}$. The Hill coefficient $n=3$ signifies a steep, switch-like transition from the \"off\" state to the \"on\" state centered at $E=K$.\n\nRegime 3: Stiff-niche. This corresponds to $E \\gg K$.\nOur calculation for $E = 50\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ represents this regime, where $E = 10 \\times K$. The resulting probability is $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(50) = \\frac{1000}{1001} \\approx 0.999$. This value is very close to one, indicating that the YAP pathway is saturated or fully activated. In this regime, the system becomes insensitive to further increases in stiffness, as the response is already maximal.\n\nIn summary, the three evaluated points correspond to the three key operational regimes of a sigmoidal response curve: a basal (off) state for $E \\ll K$, a sensitive transition for $E \\approx K$, and a saturated (on) state for $E \\gg K$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{1001}  \\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1000}{1001}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2609313"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of cellular responses, we now scale up to model an entire tissue-maintaining system.

A division yields symmetric self-renewal with probability $p$ (two stem cells), symmetric differentiation with probability $q$ (two TA cells), or asymmetric division with probability $r$ (one stem and one TA cell), with $p+q+r=1$. Stem cells undergo apoptosis at rate $a_s$ (per cell per day).\n- Each TA cell divides at rate $k_t$ (per cell per day) and undergoes apoptosis at rate $a_t$ (per cell per day). TA cells also leave the TA compartment by upward migration and maturation at rate $m$ (per cell per day), which delivers cells to the differentiated villus compartment.\n- Homeostasis of the epithelium requires that the crypt supplies a constant flux $F$ (cells per day) of differentiated cells to balance villus shedding.

Hence the expected number of TA cells produced per stem division is $2q + r$. The inflow term is $k_s S (2q + r)$. Within the TA pool, each TA cell divides at rate $k_t$, which increases TA number by $+1$ per division event (one cell becomes two, net $+1$), and undergoes apoptosis at rate $a_t$ and upward migration (egress to differentiation) at rate $m$.
