The provided numerical values for pressure, resistance, and heart rate are physiologically realistic for a representative mammal and reptile of similar body mass. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear definitions to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It is a standard application of fundamental physiological principles to a comparative context.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the two fundamental principles stipulated in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the relationship between bulk flow (Cardiac Output, $CO$), driving pressure (Mean Arterial Pressure, $MAP$), and hydraulic resistance (Total Peripheral Resistance, $TPR$) is analogous to Ohm's Law and is given by:\n$$MAP = CO \\times TPR$$\nFrom this, cardiac output can be calculated as:\n$$CO = \\frac{MAP}{TPR}$$\nSecond, cardiac output is defined as the product of heart rate ($HR$) and stroke volume ($SV$):\n$$CO = HR \\times SV$$\nFrom this, stroke volume can be calculated as:\n$$SV = \\frac{CO}{HR}$$\n\nWe will now apply these principles to each species.\n\nFor Species A (endotherm):\nThe given values are $MAP_A = 100 \\text{ mmHg}$, $TPR_A = 0.280 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}$, and $HR_A = 120 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$.\n\nThe cardiac output for Species A, $CO_A$, is calculated as:\n$$CO_A = \\frac{MAP_A}{TPR_A} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mmHg}}{0.280 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}} = \\frac{2500}{7} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1} \\approx 357.14 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$$\nThe stroke volume for Species A, $SV_A$, is then calculated using the computed $CO_A$ and given $HR_A$:\n$$SV_A = \\frac{CO_A}{HR_A} = \\frac{\\frac{2500}{7} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}}{120 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}} = \\frac{2500}{7 \\times 120} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1} = \\frac{250}{84} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1} = \\frac{125}{42} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1} \\approx 2.976 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}$$\n\nFor Species B (ectotherm):\nThe given values are $MAP_B = 40 \\text{ mmHg}$, $TPR_B = 0.800 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}$, and $HR_B = 20 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$.\n\nThe cardiac output for Species B, $CO_B$, is calculated as:\n$$CO_B = \\frac{MAP_B}{TPR_B} = \\frac{40 \\text{ mmHg}}{0.800 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}} = 50 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$$\nThe stroke volume for Species B, $SV_B$, is then calculated using the computed $CO_B$ and given $HR_B$:\n$$SV_B = \\frac{CO_B}{HR_B} = \\frac{50 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}}{20 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}} = 2.5 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}$$\n\nInterpretation of computed values:\nThe endothermic mammal (Species A) has a cardiac output ($CO_A \\approx 357 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$) that is more than seven times greater than that of the ectothermic reptile (Species B) of the same mass ($CO_B = 50 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$). This drastic difference is a direct reflection of the much higher resting metabolic rate of endotherms, which necessitates a significantly higher rate of oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues and removal of metabolic byproducts.\n\nThis high flow rate in the endotherm is achieved through a combination of cardiovascular parameters. Species A maintains a mean arterial pressure ($100 \\text{ mmHg}$) that is $2.5$ times higher than Species B ($40 \\text{ mmHg}$). This high pressure drives blood through a systemic circuit with a significantly lower total peripheral resistance ($TPR_A = 0.280$ vs $TPR_B = 0.800$), which is characteristic of the extensive vascularization required to support high metabolic activity. The most dramatic difference is in heart rate, where the endotherm's heart beats $6$ times faster ($HR_A = 120$ vs $HR_B = 20 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$). In contrast, the stroke volumes are quite similar ($SV_A \\approx 2.98 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}$ vs $SV_B = 2.5 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}$). This demonstrates that the evolutionary adaptation for endothermy involves developing a high-pressure, high-frequency pump and a low-resistance circulatory network, rather than a simple increase in the volume of blood ejected per heartbeat.\n\nFinally, the ratio of the stroke volume of Species A to Species B, $\\frac{SV_A}{SV_B}$, is computed.\n$$ \\frac{SV_A}{SV_B} = \\frac{\\frac{125}{42} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}}{2.5 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\frac{125}{42}}{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{125}{42} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{250}{210} = \\frac{25}{21} $$\nAs a decimal, this ratio is approximately $1.190476...$.

A negative sensitivity means that $\\ln M^{\\ast}$ (and thus $M^{\\ast}$) decreases as temperature $T$ increases. This corresponds to a **Bergmann-like pattern**, where individuals are larger in colder environments. Mechanistically, this occurs because the activation energy for catabolism ($E_{\\beta}$) is greater than that for anabolism ($E_{\\alpha}$), meaning catabolic processes accelerate more strongly with increasing temperature than anabolic processes. This shifts the balance between anabolism and catabolism, leading to a smaller equilibrium size at higher temperatures.\n-   If $E_{\\alpha} > E_{\\beta}$, then $E_{\\alpha} - E_{\\beta} > 0$, which implies $s(T) > 0$. A positive sensitivity means that $M^{\\ast}$ increases as temperature $T$ increases. This corresponds to a **converse Bergmann-like pattern**, where individuals are larger in warmer environments. Mechanistically, anabolism is more sensitive to temperature changes than catabolism.

Use a conductance analogy grounded in two foundational laws: Fick’s law for diffusion of water vapor and Darcy’s law for liquid water flow through porous media. Assume a spatially lumped representation in which soil-to-leaf water movement is captured by an effective hydraulic conductance per unit leaf area, and the air-side pathway is dominated by stomatal conductance (aerodynamic and boundary-layer resistances are negligible).\n\nStart from the following fundamental bases and definitions, without invoking any pre-derived target formulas:\n1. Fick’s law of diffusion for steady flux: the molar flux of a gas-phase species is proportional to a conductance times a concentration difference. For water vapor between leaf internal airspace and ambient air, define a stomatal conductance to water vapor $g_s$ (units: mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). Under the ideal gas approximation at constant atmospheric pressure $P_a$, a vapor pressure difference is proportional to a mole fraction difference, so a leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit $\\mathrm{VPD}$ (units: kPa) corresponds to a dimensionless mole fraction deficit $D = \\mathrm{VPD} / P_a$ if $P_a$ is in kPa. Hence, the demand-side transpiration tendency scales with $g_s$ and $D$.\n2.

Using an effective soil–plant hydraulic conductance per leaf area $K$ (mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ MPa$^{-1}$), and soil and leaf water potentials $\\psi_s$ and $\\psi_\\ell$ (MPa), the supply-side flux is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{supply}} = K \\, (\\psi_s - \\psi_\\ell).\n$$\nHydraulic safety imposes a cavitation threshold $\\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ (MPa) such that sustained steady flow cannot draw the leaf potential below $\\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Thus, the maximum sustainable supply at steady state is obtained by setting $\\psi_\\ell = \\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, yielding\n$$\nE_{\\max} = \\max\\left(0, \\, K \\, (\\psi_s - \\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}})\\right).\n$$\nThe maximization with $0$ enforces the physical non-negativity of steady transpiration; if $\\psi_s \\le \\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the supply limit is non-positive, so the sustainable steady flux is zero.\n\nSteady-state coupling: At steady state, the realized transpiration cannot exceed either the gas-phase demand or the liquid-phase supply limit. Under the assumptions that $g_s$ is fixed over the time scale of interest and air-side resistances besides stomata are negligible, the realized steady transpiration is the minimum of demand and supply capacity:\n$$\nE = \\min\\left(E_{\\mathrm{demand}}, \\, E_{\\max}\\right) = \\min\\left( g_s \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{VPD}}{P_a} , \\, \\max\\left(0, K \\, (\\psi_s - \\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}})\\right) \\right).\n$$\n\nUnits and conversion: The model returns $E$ in mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The required output unit is mmol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, obtained by multiplying by $1000$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{mmol}} = 1000 \\, E.\n$$\nFinally, round $E_{\\mathrm{mmol}}$ to three decimals.\n\nAlgorithm summary for each test case $(g_s, \\mathrm{VPD}, K, \\psi_s, \\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}})$ with $P_a = 101.325$ kPa:\n1. Compute $D = \\mathrm{VPD}/P_a$.\n2. Compute $E_{\\mathrm{demand}} = g_s \\, D$.\n3. Compute $E_{\\max} = \\max\\left(0, \\, K \\, (\\psi_s - \\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}})\\right)$.\n4. Compute $E = \\min\\left(E_{\\mathrm{demand}}, E_{\\max}\\right)$.\n5. Return $E_{\\mathrm{mmol}} = 1000 \\, E$ and round to three decimals.\n\nApplying this to the given test suite:\n- Case $1$: $(0.2, 1.5, 0.002, -0.1, -2.0)$ with $P_a = 101.325$ gives $E_{\\mathrm{demand}} = 0.2 \\times (1.5/101.325) \\approx 0.002961$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, $E_{\\max} = 0.002 \\times ( -0.1 - (-2.0) ) = 0.0038$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Hence $E = 0.002961$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{mmol}} \\approx 2.961$ mmol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.\n- Case $2$: $(0.3, 3.0, 0.002, -0.1, -2.0)$ yields $E_{\\mathrm{demand}} \\approx 0.008882$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, $E_{\\max} = 0.0038$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, so $E_{\\mathrm{mmol}} = 3.800$.\n- Case $3$: $(0.2, 1.5, 0.001, -2.5, -2.0)$ yields $E_{\\max} = 0.001 \\times (-2.5 + 2.0) = -0.0005$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, so $E_{\\max} = 0$ and $E_{\\mathrm{mmol}} = 0.000$.\n- Case $4$: $(0.2, 2.0, 0.002, -0.0261535, -2.0)$ is chosen so that $E_{\\max}$ exactly matches demand: $E_{\\mathrm{demand}} = 0.2 \\times (2.0/101.325) \\approx 0.003948$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$; with $\\psi_s = -0.0261535$, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{crit}} = -2.0$, the potential drop is $1.9738465$ MPa, giving $E_{\\max} = 0.002 \\times 1.9738465 \\approx 0.003948$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Thus $E_{\\mathrm{mmol}} \\approx 3.948$.\n- Case $5$: $(0.2, 0.05, 0.001, -0.5, -2.0)$ gives $E_{\\mathrm{demand}} \\approx 0.0000987$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, $E_{\\max} = 0.001 \\times ( -0.5 - (-2.0) ) = 0.0015$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, so $E_{\\mathrm{mmol}} \\approx 0.099$.\n\nTherefore, the program should output a single line with the list $[2.961,3.800,0.000,3.948,0.099]$, formatted exactly with three decimals for each entry.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef predict_transpiration_mmol(gs, VPD, K, psi_s, psi_crit, P_atm=101.325):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute steady-state transpiration rate per unit leaf area in mmol m^-2 s^-1,\n    based on a minimal soil–plant–atmosphere continuum model.\n\n    Parameters:\n        gs (float): Stomatal conductance to water vapor (mol m^-2 s^-1).\n        VPD (float): Leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (kPa).\n        K (float): Effective soil–plant hydraulic conductance (mol m^-2 s^-1 MPa^-1).\n        psi_s (float): Soil water potential (MPa).\n        psi_crit (float): Leaf cavitation safety threshold potential (MPa).\n        P_atm (float): Atmospheric pressure (kPa).
