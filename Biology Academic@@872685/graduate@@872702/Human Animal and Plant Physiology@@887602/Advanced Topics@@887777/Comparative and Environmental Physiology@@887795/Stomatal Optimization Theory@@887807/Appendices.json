The analysis begins from the provided formulation of Fick's law for diffusive molar flux.\n\nFirst, we will derive and compute the net $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ assimilation rate, $A$. According to Fick's law as stated, the molar flux is the product of the conductance and the gradient in the molar mixing ratio (mole fraction). For $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ uptake, the flux $A$ is driven by the mole fraction difference between the ambient air, $C_a$, and the intercellular airspaces, $C_i$.

In this case, we treat $A$ as being independent of $T_l$, so its dependence on $g_s$ is primarily through $CO_2$ supply (represented by the \"$\\ldots$\" in the problem's notation for $A$).

Thus, $\\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s}  0$. This has a clear physical meaning: increasing stomatal conductance increases transpiration, which is a cooling process, thereby lowering the leaf temperature.\n\nNow, evaluate the product:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s} = (\\text{negative value}) \\times (\\text{negative value}) = \\text{positive value} > 0 $$\nThis positive term represents an additional, indirect benefit of increasing $g_s$: opening stomata leads to cooling, and under hot conditions, this cooling effect increases the rate of photosynthesis by alleviating thermal stress.\n\nLet us compare the marginal benefits and costs. Let $MCG(g_s)$ be the marginal carbon gain from increasing $g_s$, and $MCC(g_s)$ be the marginal carbon cost. The optimum is where $MCG(g_s) = MCC(g_s)$.\n- In the simple model, $MCG_1(g_s) = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s}$.\n- In the full model, $MCG_2(g_s) = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s} + \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s}$.\nSince the new term is positive, $MCG_2(g_s) > MCG_1(g_s)$ for any given $g_s$.\nThe marginal cost in both models is the same: $MCC(g_s) = \\lambda_w k D$.\nThe marginal gain term $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s}$ is a decreasing function of $g_s$ due to substrate limitation for photosynthesis. Since the marginal gain curve for the full model, $MCG_2$, is shifted upwards relative to the curve for the simple model, $MCG_1$, its intersection with the horizontal marginal cost line must occur at a larger value of $g_s$.\nTherefore, including the thermal feedback **increases** the predicted optimal stomatal conductance, $g_s^*$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Including the $T_l$ feedback reduces the optimal $g_s$ under hot, dry conditions because a warmer leaf enhances Rubisco carboxylation, so the marginal carbon gain from closing stomata increases relative to the water cost.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The derivation shows the optimal $g_s$ increases, not reduces. The reasoning is also fundamentally flawed. Under the specified conditions ($T_l \\gtrsim T_{\\mathrm{opt}}$), a warmer leaf does not enhance Rubisco carboxylation; it leads to deactivation and increased photorespiration, hence $\\partial A / \\partial T_l  0$, which is the opposite of what is claimed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B.

It correctly identifies the signs of the key partial derivatives: $\\partial T_l/\\partial g_s  0$ (transpirational cooling) and $\\partial A/\\partial T_l  0$ (thermal stress on photosynthesis). It correctly interprets their product as a positive \"cooling benefit\" that adds to the marginal gain of carbon assimilation, thus favoring a higher degree of stomatal opening.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. The optimal $g_s$ is unchanged by the $T_l$ feedback because $T_l$ is effectively decoupled from $g_s$ when radiation is high and wind is moderate, so $\\partial T_l/\\partial g_s \\approx 0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The derivation shows that optimal $g_s$ does change. The reason provided, $\\partial T_l/\\partial g_s \\approx 0$, is false under the given conditions. From our derivation, $\\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s} = - \\frac{\\Lambda k D}{g_H}$. For this to be approximately zero, one would require either $D \\approx 0$ (which contradicts \"dry spell\") or $g_H \\to \\infty$ (implying infinite wind speed, which contradicts \"moderate wind\"). Transpirational cooling is a thermodynamically essential process, and leaf temperature is strongly coupled to stomatal conductance, especially under high radiation and dry air.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.

The state of the system is not only defined by external environmental drivers like $D(t)$ and $I(t)$, but also by an internal state variable, the leaf water potential $\\Psi_l(t)$. The evolution of this internal state is described by the given differential equation:\n$$C\\,\\dfrac{d\\Psi_l}{dt} = K\\left(\\Psi_s - \\Psi_l\\right) - g_s D$$\nThe objective is to choose the control variable, $g_s(t)$, at each moment in time to maximize a functional, the total photosynthetic gain over the day, $\\int_{t_{start}}^{t_{end}} A(g_s, I) dt$. This maximization is subject to constraints. The \"water-loss penalty\" implies that this is not an unconstrained maximization. In modern formulations of stomatal optimization, this penalty is explicitly linked to the hydraulic state, $\\Psi_l$. A severe drop in $\\Psi_l$ risks hydraulic failure (xylem embolism), which imposes a catastrophic cost on the plant. Therefore, the optimization problem must incorporate a cost or a hard constraint associated with $\\Psi_l$ dropping below a critical threshold.\n\nThe optimal strategy, $g_s^*(t)$, will therefore be a function not just of the instantaneous environmental inputs, but also of the internal state: $g_s^*(t) = f(D(t), I(t), \\Psi_l(t))$.\n\nLet us compare the two times $t_a$ (forenoon) and $t_p$ (afternoon).\nWe are given:\n-   $D(t_a) = D(t_p)$ and $I(t_a) = I(t_p)$.\n-   Photosynthetic capacity is identical, so the function mapping $g_s$ to assimilation, $A(g_s)$, is the same at both times.\n-   $\\Psi_l(t_a) > \\Psi_l(t_p)$. This means the plant is under less hydraulic stress at $t_a$ than at $t_p$.\n\nAn optimal controller, weighing the benefit of carbon gain against the risk of hydraulic damage, would operate as follows:\n-   At $t_a$, the leaf water potential $\\Psi_l(t_a)$ is relatively high (less negative). The plant is far from its hydraulic safety limit. The marginal cost of transpiring more water is low. Thus, the plant can afford to maintain a relatively high stomatal conductance, $g_s(t_a)$, to maximize photosynthetic rate for the given $I(t_a)$.\n-   At $t_p$, the leaf water potential $\\Psi_l(t_p)$ is lower (more negative) due to the accumulated water deficit from the period of high transpiration around noon. The plant is now closer to its hydraulic safety limit. The marginal cost, or risk, of transpiring more water is high. To avoid catastrophic failure, the optimal strategy is to be more conservative and reduce water loss. This is achieved by setting a lower stomatal conductance, $g_s(t_p)$.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy dictates that $g_s(t_a) > g_s(t_p)$. This inequality, for identical values of $D$, is the definition of the observed clockwise hysteresis. The history of the system, encapsulated by the dynamic state variable $\\Psi_l$, determines the optimal response.

It presumes a static optimization where the control variable depends only on external inputs. In any dynamic system with an internal state that influences costs or constraints, the optimal control is necessarily state-dependent.

First, it proposes a mechanism (temperature-driven change in cuticular conductance) to explain a phenomenon about stomatal conductance ($g_s$). While cuticular conductance ($g_{cuticle}$) contributes to total leaf conductance, an increase in this uncontrolled water loss pathway would increase hydraulic risk, forcing an optimal plant to *decrease* its stomatal conductance $g_s$ to compensate.
