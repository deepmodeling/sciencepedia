The problem is well-posed, as it provides sufficient information (two data points) to determine the single unknown parameter $\\Delta H$ under the assumption it is constant over the given temperature range. The problem is objective and uses precise scientific language. No flaws from the checklist are identified.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe binding of an oxygen molecule, $O_2$, to a single binding site on a pigment molecule, $P$, can be represented by the equilibrium:\n$$ P + O_2 \\rightleftharpoons PO_2 $$\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium association constant, $K$, for this reaction is defined in terms of the activities ($a$) of the species involved:\n$$ K = \\frac{a_{PO_2}}{a_P \\cdot a_{O_2}} $$\nAssuming the solution is sufficiently dilute, the activities of the pigment species can be approximated by their molar concentrations, so $a_{PO_2} \\approx [PO_2]$ and $a_P \\approx [P]$. The problem states that the activity of oxygen is proportional to its partial pressure, $P_{O_2}$, scaled by a standard pressure, $p^{\\circ}$. Thus, $a_{O_2} = \\frac{P_{O_2}}{p^{\\circ}}$. The expression for the association constant becomes:\n$$ K = \\frac{[PO_2]}{[P] \\cdot \\frac{P_{O_2}}{p^{\\circ}}} $$\nThe fractional saturation, $Y$, is the fraction of binding sites occupied by oxygen:\n$$ Y = \\frac{[PO_2]}{[P] + [PO_2]} $$\nRearranging the expression for $K$, we have $[PO_2] = K \\cdot [P] \\cdot \\frac{P_{O_2}}{p^{\\circ}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $Y$:\n$$ Y = \\frac{K \\cdot [P] \\cdot \\frac{P_{O_2}}{p^{\\circ}}}{[P] + K \\cdot [P] \\cdot \\frac{P_{O_2}}{p^{\\circ}}} = \\frac{K \\cdot \\frac{P_{O_2}}{p^{\\circ}}}{1 + K \\cdot \\frac{P_{O_2}}{p^{\\circ}}} $$\nThe half-saturation pressure, $P_{50}$, is defined as the partial pressure of oxygen at which the fractional saturation $Y$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$. At $P_{O_2} = P_{50}$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K \\cdot \\frac{P_{50}}{p^{\\circ}}}{1 + K \\cdot \\frac{P_{50}}{p^{\\circ}}} $$\nSolving this equation for $K$ yields a direct relationship between the association constant and $P_{50}$:\n$$ 1 + K \\cdot \\frac{P_{50}}{p^{\\circ}} = 2 \\cdot K \\cdot \\frac{P_{50}}{p^{\\circ}} $$\n$$ 1 = K \\cdot \\frac{P_{50}}{p^{\\circ}} \\implies K = \\frac{p^{\\circ}}{P_{50}} $$\nThis shows that the association constant $K$ is inversely proportional to the half-saturation pressure $P_{50}$. A higher affinity (larger $K$) corresponds to a lower $P_{50}$.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant is described by the van't Hoff equation. Assuming the enthalpy change, $\\Delta H$, is constant over the temperature range of interest, the integrated form of the equation is:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta H}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) $$\nHere, $K_1$ and $K_2$ are the equilibrium constants at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ respectively, and $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe can substitute the expression $K = \\frac{p^{\\circ}}{P_{50}}$ into the van't Hoff equation. The ratio $\\frac{K_2}{K_1}$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{p^{\\circ}/P_{50}(T_2)}{p^{\\circ}/P_{50}(T_1)} = \\frac{P_{50}(T_1)}{P_{50}(T_2)} $$\nNotice that the standard pressure $p^{\\circ}$ cancels out, as do the units of $P_{50}$, provided they are consistent for both measurements.
