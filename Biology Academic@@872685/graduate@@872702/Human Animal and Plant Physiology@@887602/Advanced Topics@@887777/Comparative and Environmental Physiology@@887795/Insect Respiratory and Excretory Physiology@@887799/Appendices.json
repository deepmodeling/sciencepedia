It is well-posed, providing a complete set of consistent data and clear objectives, allowing for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The physical values, while representing a specific scenario, are plausible within the context of insect physiology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe starting point is Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension, which relates the molar flux $J$ (amount of substance flowing per unit area per unit time) to the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that diffusion occurs from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.\n\nThe molar flow rate, which we denote as $\\dot{n}$, is the total amount of substance flowing through the entire cross-section of the tube per unit time. It is obtained by multiplying the flux $J$ by the cross-sectional area $A$ of the tracheal tube:\n$$\\dot{n} = J \\cdot A = -D \\cdot A \\cdot \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nThe problem states that the cross-section is uniform, so $A$ is constant along the length of the tube. The tracheal tube is a cylinder, so its cross-sectional area is given by $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nUnder the assumption of steady-state diffusion, the molar flow rate $\\dot{n}$ is constant along the axial direction $x$. We can integrate the expression for $\\dot{n}$ along the length of the tube from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} \\dot{n}\\,dx = \\int_{C_1}^{C_2} -D \\cdot A\\,dC$$\nSince $\\dot{n}$, $D$, and $A$ are constant, we have:\n$$\\dot{n} \\cdot L = -D \\cdot A \\cdot (C_2 - C_1) = D \\cdot A \\cdot (C_1 - C_2)$$\nHere, $C_1$ is the concentration at the entrance ($x=0$) and $C_2$ is the concentration at the exit ($x=L$). The concentration difference across the segment is $\\Delta C = C_1 - C_2$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\dot{n} \\cdot L = D \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C$$\nSolving for the molar flow rate $\\dot{n}$, we obtain the expression:\n$$\\dot{n} = \\frac{D \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C}{L}$$\nThis is the same result obtained by approximating the gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ as $-\\frac{\\Delta C}{L}$ for a linear concentration profile, which is the exact profile under these steady-state, one-dimensional conditions.\n\nThe problem provides a relationship between the concentration difference $\\Delta C$ and the partial pressure difference $\\Delta P$: $\\Delta C = \\alpha \\Delta P$.

Let's calculate the minimum possible total water loss, $J_{\\mathrm{w,tot}}(D_{\\min}, Q_{\\min})$.\nFirst, calculate the respiratory water loss component with $D = D_{\\min}$.\nThe water conductance is $g_{\\mathrm{w}} = r\\, g_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 1.94 \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}\\,Pa^{-1}}) = 5.82 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}\\,Pa^{-1}}$.\nThe water vapor pressure gradient is $\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{w}} = P_{w,\\mathrm{sat}}(T)\\,(1-\\mathrm{RH}) = (3.17 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (1 - 0.40) = 1.902 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\nRespiratory water loss rate:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{w,resp}} = D_{\\min}\\, g_{\\mathrm{w}}\\, \\Delta P_{\\mathrm{w}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{17}\\right) \\times (5.82 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}\\,Pa^{-1}}) \\times (1.902 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) $$\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{w,resp}} \\approx 0.23529 \\times 1.106964 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 2.6046 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} $$\nNext, calculate the excretory water loss component with $Q = Q_{\\min}$.\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{w,ex}} = Q_{\\min}\\, c_{\\mathrm{w}} = (4.00 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (5.55 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}) = 2.22 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThe minimum total water loss is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{w,tot,min}} = J_{\\mathrm{w,resp}} + J_{\\mathrm{w,ex}} \\approx (2.6046 \\times 10^{-10} + 2.22 \\times 10^{-10})\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} = 4.8246 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} $$\nWe compare this to the maximum allowable water loss:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{w,max}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} $$\nSince $4.8246 \\times 10^{-10} < 1.00 \\times 10^{-9}$, the pair $(D_{\\min}, Q_{\\min})$ is admissible. As this pair provides the absolute minimum possible water loss, it is the solution.\n\nFinally, we report the values of $D$ and $Q$ in the requested formats and units, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\nValue of $D$:\n$$ D = D_{\\min} = \\frac{4}{17} \\approx 0.235294... $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $D = 0.2353$.\n\nValue of $Q$:\n$$ Q = Q_{\\min} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\nTo convert to $\\mathrm{nL\\,s^{-1}}$, we use the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{m^3} = 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{nL}$.\n$$ Q = (4.00 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{nL\\,m^{-3}}) = 4.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{nL\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThis value is $0.00400\\ \\mathrm{nL\\,s^{-1}}$. To express it with $4$ significant figures, we write $0.004000\\ \\mathrm{nL\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe pair $(D, Q)$ that minimizes total water loss under the given constraints is $(0.2353, 0.004000\\ \\mathrm{nL\\,s^{-1}})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2353 & 0.004000\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2575578"}]}
