The problem explicitly states to use an ideal colligative approach, where the water activity is approximated by the mole fraction of water, $x_w$.\n$$ a_w \\approx x_w = \\frac{n_w}{n_{total}} $$\nHere, $n_w$ is the number of moles of the solvent (water), and $n_{total}$ is the total number of moles of all chemical species in the solution.\n\nThe problem specifies that NaCl is completely dissociated into its constituent ions in the aqueous solution:\n$$ \\text{NaCl}_{(s)} \\rightarrow \\text{Na}^{+}_{(aq)} + \\text{Cl}^{-}_{(aq)} $$\nTherefore, the solute particles are the sodium ions, $\\text{Na}^{+}$, and the chloride ions, $\\text{Cl}^{-}$. The total moles of particles, $n_{total}$, is the sum of the moles of water, $n_w$, moles of sodium ions, $n_{\\text{Na}^{+}}$, and moles of chloride ions, $n_{\\text{Cl}^{-}}$.\n$$ n_{total} = n_w + n_{\\text{Na}^{+}} + n_{\\text{Cl}^{-}} $$\nTo calculate the mole fraction, we must determine the number of moles of each component. Let us consider a basis of $1.00$ L of the solution.\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of the solute ions. The concentration of the NaCl solution is given as $c_{NaCl} = 4.00$ M, which is equivalent to $4.00$ moles of NaCl per liter of solution.\nFor $V = 1.00$ L of solution, the moles of NaCl are:\n$$ n_{NaCl} = c_{NaCl} \\times V = 4.00 \\, \\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{L}} \\times 1.00 \\, \\text{L} = 4.00 \\, \\text{mol} $$\nDue to complete dissociation, each mole of NaCl yields one mole of $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and one mole of $\\text{Cl}^{-}$.\n$$ n_{\\text{Na}^{+}} = n_{NaCl} = 4.00 \\, \\text{mol} $$\n$$ n_{\\text{Cl}^{-}} = n_{NaCl} = 4.00 \\, \\text{mol} $$\nThe total moles of solute particles (ions) is:\n$$ n_{solute} = n_{\\text{Na}^{+}} + n_{\\text{Cl}^{-}} = 4.00 \\, \\text{mol} + 4.00 \\, \\text{mol} = 8.00 \\, \\text{mol} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of the solvent, water.

Their lower growth limit is approximately $a_w = 0.75$. The calculated water activity of $0.870$ is well above this limit, so these organisms are expected to grow.\n- **Xerophilic fungi**: These fungi are adapted to grow in environments with very low water availability.

At extremely high salt concentrations (e.g., several molar NaCl), water activity is significantly reduced. Most proteins would aggregate and precipitate under these conditions, a phenomenon known as \"salting out.\" This occurs because the abundant salt ions sequester water molecules for their own hydration, leaving insufficient water to maintain the protein's hydration shell, which is critical for its solubility.\n\nHalophilic proteins have evolved a specific adaptation to counteract this effect: an unusually high density of acidic residues (Aspartate and Glutamate) on their solvent-exposed surfaces. The specified mutations (Lys $\\to$ Glu, Arg $\\to$ Asp) are an engineered example of this natural strategy. At neutral or even moderately acidic $pH$, these residues are deprotonated, conferring a large net negative charge on the protein surface. This high surface charge density enhances solubility at high ionic strength through several complementary physicochemical mechanisms:\n\n1.  **Enhanced Hydration Shell:** The carboxylate groups of Asp and Glu are excellent at coordinating water molecules through strong ion-dipole interactions. This creates a tightly bound, stable hydration layer around the protein. This robust shell is less easily disrupted by the high concentration of bulk salt ions, effectively enabling the protein to \"outcompete\" the salt for necessary solvating water molecules.\n\n2.  **Binding of Hydrated Cations:** The highly negative surface attracts and binds a layer of hydrated cations (e.g., K$^+$, Na$^+$) from the solution. This forms a complex solvation sphere composed of the protein, bound ions, and their associated water molecules. This entire complex is more readily solubilized in the hypersaline medium. Instead of being a liability, the high salt concentration becomes an integral part of the protein's solvation structure.\n\n3.  **Inter-protein Electrostatic Repulsion:** Although electrostatic interactions are heavily screened at high ionic strength (i.e., the Debye length is very short), the sheer magnitude of the negative charge on each protein creates a powerful repulsive force at the very short distances relevant for contact and aggregation. This strong, short-range repulsion provides a kinetic and thermodynamic barrier against the close approach of protein molecules, thereby preventing the hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions that drive aggregation.\n\nIn summary, by increasing the density of negative charge on the protein surface, the engineered mutations enhance the protein's ability to structure a stable solvation environment around itself and maintain strong repulsive forces, thus preventing aggregation in a high-salinity milieu. This is a fundamental principle of proteostasis in extremophiles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.304}$$", "id": "2595415"}]}
