We will now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, in a rectangular microchannel under the parallel-plate approximation ($w \\gg h$). We begin with the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible Newtonian fluid. For steady, fully developed, unidirectional flow in the $x$-direction, the velocity vector is $\\vec{u} = (u_x(y), 0, 0)$. The assumptions lead to a significant simplification of the momentum equation in the $x$-direction:\n\n$\\rho (\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial t} + u_x \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + u_z \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z}) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu (\\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial z^2})$\n\n1.  **Steady flow**: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Unidirectional flow**: $u_y = u_z = 0$.\n3.  **Fully developed flow**: The velocity profile is constant along the flow direction, thus $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = 0$. This also implies the pressure gradient, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, is a constant.\n4.  **Parallel-plate approximation ($w \\gg h$)**: We neglect velocity gradients in the width ($z$) direction, so $\\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial z^2} = 0$. The flow is effectively two-dimensional between two infinite parallel plates.\n\nUnder these conditions, the Navier-Stokes equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation, representing a balance between pressure and viscous forces:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u_x}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\n$$\nThe channel height is $h$, and we set the origin of the $y$-axis at the center of the channel, so the walls are located at $y = \\pm h/2$.\n\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{du_x}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y + C_1\n$$\n$$\nu_x(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2\n$$\n\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined from the no-slip boundary conditions at the walls: $u_x(y = h/2) = 0$ and $u_x(y = -h/2) = 0$.\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_1 \\frac{h}{2} + C_2\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left(-\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 - C_1 \\frac{h}{2} + C_2\n$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first yields $C_1 h = 0$, which implies $C_1 = 0$.

Given the parameters $K_X=1$ and $n_X=2$, the activities simplify to:\n$$\na_W = \\frac{m_W^{2}}{1 + m_W^{2}},\\quad a_N = \\frac{m_N^{2}}{1 + m_N^{2}},\\quad a_B = \\frac{m_B^{2}}{1 + m_B^{2}}\n$$\n\n$2$. Compute intermediate probabilities. Using the calculated activities and the provided constants, we determine the stem cell self-renewal probability $p_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and the secretory differentiation bias $p_{\\mathrm{sec}}$:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\left(\\frac{a_W^{2}}{a_W^{2} + 0.25^{2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.9^{2}}{a_B^{2} + 0.9^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{sec}} = \\frac{0.5^{2}}{a_N^{2} + 0.5^{2}}\n$$\n\n$3$. Construct the transition matrix $T$. The elements of the $3 \\times 3$ matrix $T$ are populated according to its definition using the computed probabilities $p_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{sec}}$ and the given constants $g_{\\mathrm{Se}}=0.6$ and $g_{\\mathrm{Ab}}=0.7$.\n\n$4$. Compute the dominant eigenvector. The power iteration method is employed as stipulated. An initial vector $v^{(0)} = [1, 1, 1]^\\top$ is iteratively multiplied by the matrix $T$. After each multiplication, the resulting vector is normalized by the sum of its components (the $\\ell_1$ norm).\n$$\nv^{(t+1)}_{\\text{unnormalized}} = T v^{(t)}\n$$\n$$\nv^{(t+1)} = \\frac{v^{(t+1)}_{\\text{unnormalized}}}{\\mathbf{1}^\\top v^{(t+1)}_{\\text{unnormalized}}}\n$$\nThis process is repeated for a sufficient number of iterations to ensure convergence to the dominant eigenvector, which represents the steady-state proportions $\\pi$.\n\n$5$. Format the output. The resulting proportion vector $\\pi = [\\pi_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\pi_{\\mathrm{Se}}, \\pi_{\\mathrm{Ab}}]$ for each test case is rounded to three decimal places. The collection of results from all test cases is then formatted into a single string as per the output specification.\nThis constitutes a complete and rigorous procedure for solving the problem.", "answer": "$$\n\\big[ [0.422,0.264,0.314],[0.55,0.17,0.28],[0.269,0.315,0.416],[0.422,0.11,0.468],[0.422,0.472,0.106],[0.174,0.373,0.453],[0.565,0.187,0.248],[0.72,0.21,0.07],[0.0,0.409,0.591] \\big]\n$$", "id": "2589264"}]}
