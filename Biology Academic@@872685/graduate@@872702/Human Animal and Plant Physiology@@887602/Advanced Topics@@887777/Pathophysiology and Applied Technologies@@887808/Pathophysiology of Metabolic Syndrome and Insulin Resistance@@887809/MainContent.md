## Introduction
At the epicenter of the global chronic disease epidemic lies metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions whose pathophysiological core is [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310). This state, in which cells fail to respond appropriately to the hormone insulin, is a precursor to [type 2 diabetes](@entry_id:154880) and a major driver of cardiovascular disease. Understanding its development is paramount, yet the journey from a diet rich in excess nutrients to a full-blown systemic disease is complex, spanning from organelle dysfunction to whole-body hormonal dysregulation. This article bridges this knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive, mechanism-based exploration of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

The following chapters will guide you through this multifaceted topic. The first, **Principles and Mechanisms**, dissects the fundamental biology, from the elegant [feedback loops](@entry_id:265284) governing normal [glucose homeostasis](@entry_id:148694) to the molecular stress pathways that dismantle them. We will explore how cellular insults like [lipotoxicity](@entry_id:156126) and inflammation converge to impair the canonical [insulin signaling](@entry_id:170423) cascade. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, broadens the scope to illustrate how these core mechanisms manifest clinically, influencing everything from cardiovascular health and [reproductive endocrinology](@entry_id:176124) to brain function and [circadian rhythms](@entry_id:153946). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers a chance to solidify your understanding by applying these principles to solve quantitative problems that model real-world physiological and clinical scenarios.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter dissects the core principles governing insulin action and the mechanisms that underlie the development of [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310) and metabolic syndrome. We will begin by constructing a model of normal [glucose homeostasis](@entry_id:148694), from the systemic feedback loops down to the intricate molecular signaling within the cell. Subsequently, we will explore the primary pathological insults—originating from organelle dysfunction, inflammation, and cellular stress—that disrupt this finely tuned system, leading to the state of [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310). Finally, we will examine the systemic consequences of this disruption, including the paradoxical behavior of the liver and the ultimate failure of the pancreatic [beta-cells](@entry_id:155544) that precipitates overt type 2 diabetes.

### Systemic Glucose Homeostasis: A Feedback Control System

The maintenance of plasma glucose concentration within a narrow physiological range, known as **euglycemia**, is a classic example of a biological [negative feedback](@entry_id:138619) system. The system's principal components are the pancreatic islet cells, which act as sensors and controllers, and the major metabolic tissues—liver, [skeletal muscle](@entry_id:147955), and [adipose tissue](@entry_id:172460)—which act as effectors. The primary anabolic hormone, **insulin**, and its main counter-regulatory hormone, **glucagon**, orchestrate this control [@problem_id:2591751].

In the fasting state, a rise in plasma glucose ($G$) is detected by pancreatic [beta-cells](@entry_id:155544), stimulating the secretion of insulin ($I$). Insulin acts on its target tissues to lower plasma glucose through two main actions: it suppresses **hepatic glucose production** ($H$) and stimulates **whole-body glucose disposal** ($U$), primarily into [skeletal muscle](@entry_id:147955) and [adipose tissue](@entry_id:172460). This glucose-lowering effect of insulin then feeds back to the [beta-cells](@entry_id:155544), reducing the stimulus for further insulin secretion. This constitutes the primary **glucose-insulin negative feedback loop**: a rise in $G$ leads to a rise in $I$, which in turn causes a fall in $G$. The mathematical representation of these monotonic relationships, expressed as partial derivatives, confirms the [negative feedback](@entry_id:138619) structure: the sensitivity of insulin secretion to glucose, $\frac{dS}{dG}$, is positive, while the sensitivity of the rate of change of glucose to insulin, which combines insulin's effect on production ($\frac{\partial H}{\partial I}  0$) and disposal ($\frac{\partial U}{\partial I} > 0$), is negative.

A parallel [negative feedback loop](@entry_id:145941) involves glucagon ($A$). A rise in glucose, along with the concomitant rise in insulin, suppresses [glucagon](@entry_id:152418) secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells ($\frac{\partial R}{\partial G}  0$ and $\frac{\partial R}{\partial I}  0$). Since [glucagon](@entry_id:152418)'s primary action is to stimulate hepatic glucose production ($\frac{\partial H}{\partial A} > 0$), its suppression contributes to lowering plasma glucose. This **glucose-glucagon loop** is therefore also a [negative feedback](@entry_id:138619) system. Together, these interlocking feedback loops ensure robust and stable control of glycemia. During hypoglycemia, the reverse occurs: falling glucose and insulin levels disinhibit [glucagon](@entry_id:152418) secretion, leading to a rise in glucagon that stimulates hepatic glucose production and restores euglycemia [@problem_id:2591751].

Insulin resistance fundamentally represents a reduction in the **loop gain** of this control system. If the sensitivity of tissues to insulin is reduced—meaning the magnitudes of $\frac{\partial H}{\partial I}$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial I}$ are diminished—a given concentration of insulin will produce a smaller glucose-lowering effect. To maintain euglycemia under these conditions, the system must compensate by secreting more insulin, leading to the characteristic state of **fasting [hyperinsulinemia](@entry_id:154039)**.

### The Canonical Insulin Signaling Pathway: From Receptor to Response

To understand how insulin executes its function and how this process can fail, we must zoom into the cell. Insulin initiates its effects by binding to the **[insulin receptor](@entry_id:146089) (IR)**, a member of the [receptor tyrosine kinase](@entry_id:153267) (RTK) family. This binding event triggers a conformational change that activates the receptor's intrinsic kinase activity, leading to *trans*-[autophosphorylation](@entry_id:136800) of its intracellular domains on specific tyrosine residues.

These newly created [phosphotyrosine](@entry_id:139963) sites serve as high-affinity docking platforms for [scaffold proteins](@entry_id:148003), most notably **[insulin receptor](@entry_id:146089) substrate 1 (IRS1)** and **[insulin receptor](@entry_id:146089) substrate 2 (IRS2)**. IRS proteins bind to the activated receptor via their **[phosphotyrosine](@entry_id:139963)-binding (PTB) domains** and are then themselves phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues by the receptor kinase. This step serves as a critical amplification and signal diversification node.

The key metabolic actions of insulin are mediated by the recruitment of **[phosphoinositide 3-kinase](@entry_id:202373) (PI3K)** to these [phosphotyrosine](@entry_id:139963) motifs on IRS proteins. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, contains **Src homology 2 (SH2) domains** that specifically recognize and bind to these sites. This interaction recruits the PI3K complex to the [plasma membrane](@entry_id:145486) and activates its catalytic subunit, p110. The activated p110 subunit then catalyzes the phosphorylation of the membrane lipid **phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2)** to generate the crucial [second messenger](@entry_id:149538) **phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3)** [@problem_id:2591770].

PIP3 accumulation in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane serves as a docking site for proteins containing **Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains**. Two key downstream kinases, **3-[phosphoinositide](@entry_id:198851)-dependent [protein kinase](@entry_id:146851)-1 (PDK1)** and **protein kinase B (AKT)**, possess PH domains and are thus recruited to the membrane. This co-localization allows PDK1 to phosphorylate AKT on a key threonine residue (Thr308 in AKT1, Thr309 in AKT2) in its activation loop. Full activation of AKT requires a second phosphorylation on a serine residue (Ser473 in AKT1/2) by the **mechanistic target of [rapamycin](@entry_id:198475) complex 2 (mTORC2)**. While several AKT isoforms exist, the **AKT2** isoform is genetically established as the predominant mediator of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle and [adipose tissue](@entry_id:172460).

In parallel to this metabolic branch, the [insulin receptor](@entry_id:146089) can also initiate signals related to cell growth and proliferation (mitogenic signaling). This typically involves the adaptor protein **Grb2** binding to a receptor or IRS [phosphotyrosine](@entry_id:139963) via its SH2 domain. Grb2 recruits the guanine [nucleotide exchange factor](@entry_id:199424) **SOS**, which in turn activates the small GTPase **Ras**. Ras initiates the well-known **Raf-MEK-ERK** [kinase cascade](@entry_id:138548), which primarily regulates gene expression and cell division. Critically, this mitogenic branch is neither necessary nor sufficient for the acute stimulation of glucose uptake [@problem_id:2591770].

### The Final Step: GLUT4 Transporter Trafficking and Fusion

The culmination of the [metabolic signaling](@entry_id:184827) cascade in [skeletal muscle](@entry_id:147955) and [adipose tissue](@entry_id:172460) is the translocation of the **glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4)** from intracellular storage vesicles to the plasma membrane. This process dramatically increases the cell's capacity for glucose uptake.

The key substrate of AKT2 that links the [signaling cascade](@entry_id:175148) to the trafficking machinery is **Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160)**, also known as **TBC1D4**. AS160 is a **Rab-GTPase activating protein (Rab-GAP)**. Rab proteins are small GTPases that function as molecular switches to control [vesicle trafficking](@entry_id:137322), with the GTP-bound form being active and the GDP-bound form being inactive. GAPs, like AS160, accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thus inactivating Rabs.

In the basal, unstimulated state, AS160 is active and maintains its target Rabs (such as **Rab8A** and **Rab10**) in the inactive, GDP-bound state. This acts as a molecular brake, preventing the GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) from moving to and fusing with the [plasma membrane](@entry_id:145486). Upon insulin stimulation, activated AKT2 phosphorylates AS160. This phosphorylation **inhibits** the GAP activity of AS160. With the brake removed, Rab8A and Rab10 can become loaded with GTP, switching to their active state. Active, GTP-bound Rabs on the GSV surface then recruit effector proteins, including [motor proteins](@entry_id:140902) for transport along the [cytoskeleton](@entry_id:139394) and tethering complexes like the exocyst, which guide the vesicle to the plasma membrane [@problem_id:2591752].

The final step is the physical merger of the vesicle and plasma membranes, a process mediated by **SNARE proteins**. In [skeletal muscle](@entry_id:147955), the vesicle-associated SNARE (**v-SNARE**) is **VAMP2**, located on the GSV. The target membrane SNAREs (**t-SNAREs**) are **Syntaxin-4** and **SNAP23**, located on the plasma membrane. The formation of a stable complex between these three proteins drives [membrane fusion](@entry_id:152357). This process is also tightly regulated. For instance, the protein **Munc18c** binds to Syntaxin-4, acting as an inhibitory "clamp" that prevents its engagement in the SNARE complex. Insulin signaling is thought to relieve this clamp, permitting the final fusion event and the insertion of GLUT4 into the membrane, thereby opening the gates for glucose to enter the cell [@problem_id:2591752].

### Dynamic Control: The Role of Negative Regulators

The [insulin signaling pathway](@entry_id:178355) is not a simple linear chain that remains active indefinitely. Its amplitude and duration are dynamically shaped by a suite of negative regulators, primarily phosphatases, that act at every level of the cascade. Understanding these "off-switches" is as important as understanding the "on-switches," as their dysregulation can profoundly alter cellular responsiveness to insulin.

We can analyze the distinct roles of three key phosphatases using a simplified kinetic framework [@problem_id:2591812]:
1.  **Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B):** This enzyme acts at the very top of the cascade by dephosphorylating and inactivating the [insulin receptor](@entry_id:146089) itself. An increase in PTP1B activity lowers the upstream gain of the system, reducing the number of activated receptors for a given insulin concentration. This directly decreases the peak signal amplitude. Furthermore, by accelerating receptor deactivation, PTP1B shortens the [time constant](@entry_id:267377) of the receptor, leading to a more rapid [signal termination](@entry_id:174294) and thus a shorter signal duration.

2.  **Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN):** This lipid [phosphatase](@entry_id:142277) acts on the second messenger PIP3, converting it back to PIP2 by removing the phosphate at the D3 position of the inositol ring. PTEN acts as a direct sink for the PIP3 signal. Increasing PTEN activity therefore reduces the peak concentration of PIP3 and, consequently, the peak activation of AKT. By accelerating the degradation of PIP3, it also directly shortens the duration of the downstream signal.

3.  **SH2-containing Inositol 5-Phosphatase 2 (SHIP2):** This phosphatase also acts on PIP3, but it removes the phosphate at the D5 position, generating **phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2)**. This action has a more nuanced effect. Like PTEN, SHIP2 depletes PIP3, which reduces the peak signal amplitude because PI(3,4)P2 is a less potent recruiter of AKT than PIP3. However, unlike PTEN's action which terminates the signal, SHIP2's action converts PIP3 into another, albeit weaker, signaling molecule. If this PI(3,4)P2 intermediate is longer-lived than PIP3 itself, its presence can sustain a low level of AKT activation for a longer period. Thus, SHIP2 can decrease the signal's peak while paradoxically prolonging its tail, changing the overall shape and duration of the cellular response [@problem_id:2591812].

### The Pathophysiology of Insulin Resistance

Insulin resistance is a condition in which normal concentrations of insulin produce a subnormal biological response. At the molecular level, this is almost universally characterized by an impairment of the canonical signaling pathway described above. While the ultimate outcome is reduced AKT activation and diminished glucose uptake, the upstream causes are diverse and originate from a confluence of cellular stresses.

#### The Central Lesion: Impairment of IRS-PI3K-AKT Signaling

The convergence point for most forms of cellular insulin resistance is the **[insulin receptor](@entry_id:146089) substrate (IRS)** protein. Rather than a simple failure of expression, the predominant mechanism is the **inhibitory serine/threonine phosphorylation** of IRS proteins. Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, often in proximity to the PTB domain or the PI3K binding sites, can induce a conformational change that (1) prevents the IRS protein from docking with the [insulin receptor](@entry_id:146089), (2) blocks its subsequent [tyrosine phosphorylation](@entry_id:203782), and/or (3) hinders its ability to bind and activate PI3K. This serine phosphorylation can also mark the IRS protein for proteasomal degradation, reducing its total abundance. The net effect is an uncoupling of the [insulin receptor](@entry_id:146089) from its key downstream metabolic effector pathway.

#### Upstream Drivers of Cellular Dysfunction

The kinases responsible for this inhibitory serine phosphorylation are not typically active under normal conditions. Their activation is a hallmark of cellular stress, often stemming from organelle dysfunction driven by chronic nutrient excess.

##### Mitochondrial Dysfunction and the Genesis of Lipotoxicity

In metabolic tissues like skeletal muscle, a crucial hypothesis for the origin of [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310) centers on the mitochondrion. In individuals with metabolic syndrome, [skeletal muscle](@entry_id:147955) often exhibits reduced **oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) capacity**. This means that even with maximal stimulation, the mitochondria have a lower intrinsic ability to oxidize substrates and produce ATP. When this is combined with impaired [fatty acid oxidation](@entry_id:153280) capacity in the face of a normal or elevated influx of fatty acids from the circulation, a fundamental mismatch in substrate handling occurs. Based on the principle of [mass conservation](@entry_id:204015), if the rate of fatty acid uptake ($J_{\mathrm{in}}$) exceeds the rate of [fatty acid oxidation](@entry_id:153280) ($J_{\mathrm{ox}}$), the surplus lipids must be stored within the cell ($dL/dt = J_{\mathrm{in}} - J_{\mathrm{ox}} > 0$) [@problem_id:2591823]. This leads to the accumulation of intramyocellular lipids, not only as inert triglycerides but also as bioactive lipid intermediates such as **[diacylglycerol](@entry_id:169338) (DAG)** and **ceramides**. This process, termed **[lipotoxicity](@entry_id:156126)**, provides the substrate for activating inhibitory kinases.

##### Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and the Unfolded Protein Response

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is responsible for folding and processing the vast number of proteins secreted by or inserted into the membrane of a cell. In metabolic tissues and particularly in the hyper-secreting [beta-cell](@entry_id:167727), chronic nutrient excess places an enormous load on the ER's protein-folding capacity. This can lead to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, a condition known as **ER stress**. The cell responds by initiating the **Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)**, a set of [signaling pathways](@entry_id:275545) designed to alleviate the stress. While initially adaptive, chronic activation of the UPR can trigger inflammatory and stress-activated kinase pathways that contribute to [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310).

#### Molecular Mechanisms of Resistance: A Convergence of Stress Pathways

Multiple stress-activated kinase pathways, triggered by distinct upstream insults, converge on IRS proteins to induce insulin resistance.

##### Lipotoxicity: Direct Activation of Inhibitory Kinases and Phosphatases

The accumulation of specific lipid species directly activates signaling enzymes that antagonize insulin action [@problem_id:2591824].
-   **Diacylglycerol (DAG):** Elevated DAG levels are a direct consequence of the mismatch between fatty acid uptake and oxidation. DAG functions as a potent allosteric activator for **novel protein kinase C (nPKC)** isoforms, such as **PKCε** in the liver and **PKCθ** in skeletal muscle. Once activated at the membrane, these nPKCs phosphorylate IRS proteins on inhibitory serine residues, directly impairing the PI3K-AKT pathway at its inception.
-   **Ceramides:** Accumulation of ceramides, a class of [sphingolipids](@entry_id:171301), initiates a distinct inhibitory pathway. Ceramides can activate **Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A)**. Unlike the PKC pathway that blocks signaling upstream of AKT, PP2A acts directly on AKT itself, dephosphorylating it at its activating Thr308 and Ser473 sites. This mechanism leads to [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310) by actively terminating the AKT signal, even if the upstream cascade is functional [@problem_id:2591824].

##### Metaflammation I: ER Stress and the JNK Pathway

One of the key sensors of the UPR is the ER-[transmembrane protein](@entry_id:176217) **Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1)**. Upon activation by ER stress, IRE1 oligomerizes and activates its cytosolic domain. This activated domain can function as a scaffold to recruit the adaptor protein **TRAF2**, which in turn initiates a [kinase cascade](@entry_id:138548) leading to the activation of **c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)**. JNK is an archetypal stress-activated kinase that, once active, phosphorylates IRS1 on inhibitory serine residues (e.g., Ser307 in rodents), providing a direct mechanistic link between ER stress and the impairment of [insulin signaling](@entry_id:170423) [@problem_id:2591774].

##### Metaflammation II: Innate Immune Signaling via Toll-Like Receptors

Insulin resistance is now widely recognized as a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation, termed **metaflammation**. This involves the ectopic activation of innate [immune signaling pathways](@entry_id:195032) in metabolic tissues. **Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)**, a key pattern recognition receptor of the [innate immune system](@entry_id:201771), can be activated not only by its classical ligand, bacterial [lipopolysaccharide](@entry_id:188695) (LPS), but also by specific [saturated fatty acids](@entry_id:171277) like palmitate.

Activation of TLR4 in a hepatocyte or myocyte recruits the adaptor protein **MyD88**, initiating a [signaling cascade](@entry_id:175148) through **IRAKs** and **TRAF6** that culminates in the activation of the kinase **TAK1**. TAK1 serves as a crucial [branch point](@entry_id:169747), activating both the **IKK** complex and the **JNK** pathway. The IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitor of **NF-κB**, leading to NF-κB's nuclear [translocation](@entry_id:145848) and the transcription of pro-inflammatory [cytokines](@entry_id:156485) (e.g., TNFα, IL-6). Concurrently, the activation of JNK (and to a lesser extent, IKK itself) provides another potent source of inhibitory IRS1 serine phosphorylation [@problem_id:2591804]. This pathway elegantly illustrates how dietary factors ([saturated fats](@entry_id:170451)) can co-opt inflammatory signaling machinery to simultaneously drive inflammation and [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310), highlighting the deep integration of metabolism and immunity.

### Systemic Consequences and the Progression to Type 2 Diabetes

The cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance manifest as profound and often paradoxical changes at the whole-body level, ultimately culminating in the failure of [glucose homeostasis](@entry_id:148694).

#### The Paradox of Selective Hepatic Insulin Resistance

The liver plays a central role in both glucose and [lipid metabolism](@entry_id:167911), and its response to [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310) is particularly complex. A key feature of metabolic syndrome is a state known as **[selective hepatic insulin resistance](@entry_id:167800)**. In this state, the liver becomes resistant to insulin's signal to suppress [gluconeogenesis](@entry_id:155616), yet remains sensitive (or even hypersensitive) to its signal to promote *de novo* [lipogenesis](@entry_id:178687) (the synthesis of new [fatty acids](@entry_id:145414)). This paradox is a major driver of the dual pathologies of [hyperglycemia](@entry_id:153925) and hypertriglyceridemia.

The underlying mechanism appears to lie in pathway-specific desensitization [@problem_id:2591833]. Insulin's suppression of gluconeogenesis is heavily dependent on the **IRS2-PI3K-AKT** axis, which leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor **FOXO1**. In the insulin-resistant liver, this specific branch is preferentially impaired by the mechanisms described above (e.g., lipid-induced activation of PKCε, which degrades IRS2). Consequently, FOXO1 remains active, and [gluconeogenesis](@entry_id:155616) proceeds unchecked even in the presence of high insulin levels.

In contrast, insulin's stimulation of [lipogenesis](@entry_id:178687) is driven by the transcription factor **SREBP-1c**. The activation of SREBP-1c is strongly promoted by the **mTORC1** pathway, which is highly sensitive to nutrient cues like amino acids as well as to chronic [hyperinsulinemia](@entry_id:154039) itself. In a state of overnutrition, the mTORC1-SREBP-1c axis remains robustly active, driving the expression of lipogenic genes (e.g., [fatty acid synthase](@entry_id:177530), acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and flooding the liver and circulation with lipids. This selective resistance explains how [hyperinsulinemia](@entry_id:154039) can fail to control blood sugar while actively exacerbating dyslipidemia [@problem_id:2591833].

#### The Pancreatic Beta-Cell: From Compensation to Decompensation

The development of type 2 diabetes is not an immediate consequence of insulin resistance. It is a story of a prolonged adaptation followed by eventual failure. Initially, as peripheral tissues become resistant to insulin, the pancreatic [beta-cells](@entry_id:155544) compensate by dramatically increasing their output of insulin. To maintain euglycemia in the face of a 50% drop in insulin sensitivity ($S_I$), the [beta-cells](@entry_id:155544) must secrete twice as much insulin to achieve the same glucose-lowering effect [@problem_id:2591795]. This compensatory state, characterized by [hyperinsulinemia](@entry_id:154039) but normal glycemia, is achieved through both increased secretion from individual [beta-cells](@entry_id:155544) and a gradual expansion of total [beta-cell](@entry_id:167727) mass. The relationship can be described by the **disposition index**, an idealized product of insulin sensitivity and [beta-cell](@entry_id:167727) function, which remains constant during compensation.

The transition to type 2 diabetes occurs when this compensation fails. **Beta-cell decompensation** is the phase where the [beta-cells](@entry_id:155544) can no longer sustain the high secretory output required to overcome the peripheral resistance. This failure is not a sudden event but a gradual decline driven by the very factors causing insulin resistance in the first place. Chronic exposure to high levels of glucose (**glucotoxicity**) and free [fatty acids](@entry_id:145414) (**[lipotoxicity](@entry_id:156126)**) is toxic to the [beta-cell](@entry_id:167727). This nutrient overload induces severe ER stress from the demand for massive proinsulin synthesis, [mitochondrial dysfunction](@entry_id:200120), and [oxidative stress](@entry_id:149102). These insults trigger apoptosis ([programmed cell death](@entry_id:145516)) and/or [dedifferentiation](@entry_id:162707) of [beta-cells](@entry_id:155544), leading to a progressive loss of functional [beta-cell](@entry_id:167727) mass.

The hallmarks of this decline include a loss of the rapid, **first-phase insulin release** in response to a glucose challenge, an increase in the ratio of unprocessed **proinsulin to insulin** in the circulation, and, in humans, the deposition of toxic aggregates of **islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP)** within the islets. As functional [beta-cell](@entry_id:167727) mass falls, the disposition index declines below a critical threshold, insulin secretion becomes inadequate, and fasting and post-meal [hyperglycemia](@entry_id:153925) emerge, marking the onset of overt [type 2 diabetes](@entry_id:154880) [@problem_id:2591795] [@problem_id:2591795].
