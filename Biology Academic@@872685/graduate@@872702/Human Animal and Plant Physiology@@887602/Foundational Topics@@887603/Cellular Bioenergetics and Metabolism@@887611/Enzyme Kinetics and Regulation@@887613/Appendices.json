The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, so we may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the Proportionality Constant\n\nThe canonical minimal mechanism for a single-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction is given by the following elementary steps, where $E$ is the enzyme, $S$ is the substrate, $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product:\n$$\nE + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P\n$$\nHere, $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ are the rate constants for substrate binding, substrate dissociation, and catalysis, respectively. The catalytic rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is also denoted as the turnover number. The initial velocity of the reaction, $v_0$, is the initial rate of product formation:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES]\n$$\nTo find an expression for $[ES]$, we apply the steady-state approximation, which assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant over the initial phase of the reaction, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$.\nThe rate of formation of $[ES]$ is $k_1 [E][S]$. The rate of breakdown of $[ES]$ is $(k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})[ES]$. At steady state:\n$$\nk_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is the sum of free enzyme $[E]$ and bound enzyme $[ES]$: $[E]_T = [E] + [ES]$, which implies $[E] = [E]_T - [ES]$. Substituting this into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\nk_1 ([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $[ES]$:\n$$\nk_1 [E]_T [S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\n$$\nk_1 [E]_T [S] = [ES] (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} + k_1 [S])\n$$\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_T [S]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} + k_1 [S]}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1} + [S]}\n$$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}$. Substituting $K_m$ yields the expression for the steady-state concentration of $[ES]$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the rate equation $v_0 = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES]$:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThis is the Michaelis-Menten equation. The problem statement refers to the \"initial rate per active site\", which we interpret as $v_0 / [E]_T$. Let us denote this quantity by $v'$.\n$$\nv' = \\frac{v_0}{[E]_T} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the condition of low substrate concentration, where $[S] \\ll K_m$. Under this condition, the denominator of the rate equation can be approximated as $K_m + [S] \\approx K_m$. The rate equation simplifies to:\n$$\nv' \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}{K_m} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right) [S]\n$$\nThis equation shows that for $[S] \\ll K_m$, the rate per active site $v'$ is directly proportional to the substrate concentration $[S]$. The proportionality constant is therefore the ratio $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}$. This ratio is known as the specificity constant or the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. It represents a second-order rate constant for the reaction between the enzyme and the substrate.\n\nStep 2: Computation for Enzyme A and Enzyme B\n\nWe are given the kinetic parameters for two enzymes, A and B. We will calculate the specificity constant for each, ensuring the units are converted to $\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$. The conversion for the Michaelis constant is $1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFor Enzyme A:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat, A}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$K_{m, A} = 50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\nThe specificity constant for Enzyme A is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_A = \\frac{100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{50 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}\n$$\n\nFor Enzyme B:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat, B}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$K_{m, B} = 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\nThe specificity constant for Enzyme B is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_B = \\frac{20\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{2 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 10 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Discussion of Diffusion Limit and Final Calculation\n\nThe problem states that the diffusion-controlled upper bound for the specificity constant is on the order of $10^8$ to $10^9\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$. An enzyme with a $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}$ value in this range is considered \"catalytically perfect,\" meaning its rate is limited only by how fast the substrate can diffuse to the active site.\n\nComparing our calculated values:\nEnzyme A: $\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_A = 2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$\nEnzyme B: $\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_B = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$\n\nNeither enzyme has a specificity constant that reaches the diffusion-controlled limit of $10^8\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$. Therefore, neither enzyme is diffusion-limited. Their overall catalytic rates are limited by chemical steps on the enzyme surface (e.g., conformational changes, bond breaking/formation, product release) rather than by substrate encounter frequency.\n\nTo determine which is closer to this limit, we compare their magnitudes. The value for Enzyme B, $1.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$, is one order of magnitude below the limit. The value for Enzyme A, $2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$, is closer to two orders of magnitude below the limit. Thus, Enzyme B is significantly more efficient than Enzyme A under substrate-scarce conditions and is closer to being a diffusion-limited enzyme.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the ratio $R$ of the larger constant to the smaller one.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_B}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_A} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}}{2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^6}{2 \\times 10^6} = 5\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, the dimensionless ratio $R$ is $5.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.00}\n$$", "id": "2565934"}, {"introduction": "Characterizing the mechanism of an enzyme inhibitor is a cornerstone of drug discovery and metabolic research.

This is competitively inhibited by an inhibitor, $I$, which binds only to the free enzyme to form an inactive complex, $EI$.\nThe equilibria are:\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\text{cat}}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$$\n$$E + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI$$\n\nThe relevant constants are the Michaelis constant, $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1}$, and the inhibitor dissociation constant, $K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$.\n\nThe total enzyme concentration is conserved:\n$$[E]_t = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$$\nwhere $[E]$, $[ES]$, and $[EI]$ are the concentrations of free enzyme, enzyme-substrate complex, and enzyme-inhibitor complex, respectively.\n\nThe initial velocity of the reaction, $v_i$, is given by $v_i = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]$. The uninhibited velocity, $v_0$ (when $[I]=0$ and thus $[EI]=0$), is given by the standard Michaelis-Menten equation, $v_0 = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$, where $V_{\\text{max}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_t$. This expression for $v_0$ is derived from the steady-state condition on $[ES]$ and accounts for the partitioning of enzyme between $[E]$ and $[ES]$.\n\nA general expression for the inhibited velocity $v_i$ can be derived. The fraction of the total enzyme population that is not sequestered by the inhibitor is $([E]_t - [EI])/[E]_t$. Only this fraction is available to participate in the catalytic cycle with the substrate. Therefore, the velocity in the presence of the inhibitor, $v_i$, relates to the uninhibited velocity, $v_0$, as follows:\n$$v_i = v_0 \\left( \\frac{[E]_t - [EI]}{[E]_t} \\right) = v_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{[EI]}{[E]_t} \\right)$$\nThis relationship holds for any inhibitor that acts by withdrawing free enzyme from the system (i.e., does not bind to the $ES$ complex).\n\nThe problem defines the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ as the total inhibitor concentration, $[I]_t$, at which the initial velocity is halved, i.e., $v_i = \\frac{1}{2} v_0$. Substituting this condition into the equation above:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} v_0 = v_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{[E]_t} \\right)$$\nwhere $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ is the concentration of the $EI$ complex when $[I]_t = \\mathrm{IC}_{50}$. Solving for $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ yields a crucial intermediate result:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = 1 - \\frac{[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{[E]_t} \\implies \\frac{[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{[E]_t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies [EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} = \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nThis demonstrates that at $50\\%$ inhibition, exactly half of the total enzyme is sequestered in the $EI$ complex.\n\nNow, we must relate the total inhibitor concentration, $[I]_t$, to the free inhibitor concentration, $[I]$. The mass balance for the inhibitor is:\n$$[I]_t = [I] + [EI]$$\nAt the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ condition, this becomes:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = [I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} + [EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$$\nwhere $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ is the free inhibitor concentration at the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ point. Substituting our result for $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = [I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} + \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nThis equation links the experimental observable, $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$, to the thermodynamically significant free inhibitor concentration, $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$.\n\nThe next step is to find an expression for $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$. This is the free inhibitor concentration required to halve the reaction rate. The velocity equation for competitive inhibition as a function of free inhibitor concentration $[I]$ is:\n$$v_i = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$$\nSetting $v_i = \\frac{1}{2}v_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\n$$2(K_m + [S]) = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{K_i}\\right) + [S]$$\n$$2K_m + 2[S] = K_m + \\frac{K_m[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{K_i} + [S]$$\n$$K_m + [S] = \\frac{K_m[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{K_i}$$\nSolving for $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ yields the Cheng-Prusoff equation for a competitive inhibitor:\n$$[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} = K_i \\frac{K_m + [S]}{K_m} = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ into our equation for $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nThis is the required relationship, often known as the Morrison equation for a competitive inhibitor. It accurately describes the relationship between $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ and $K_i$ when the enzyme concentration is significant.\n\nTo compute $K_i$, we rearrange this expression:\n$$K_i = \\frac{\\mathrm{IC}_{50} - \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values, ensuring consistent units. Let us use micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$).\n$[S] = 20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$K_m = 50~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$[E]_t = 10~\\mathrm{nM} = 0.010~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = 19~\\mathrm{nM} = 0.019~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\n$$K_i = \\frac{0.019~\\mu\\mathrm{M} - \\frac{1}{2}(0.010~\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{1 + \\frac{20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{50~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{0.019 - 0.005}{1 + 0.4} = \\frac{0.014}{1.4}~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$K_i = 0.010~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nConverting this result to nanomolar (nM) as requested:\n$$K_i = 0.010~\\mu\\mathrm{M} \\times 1000~\\frac{\\mathrm{nM}}{\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 10~\\mathrm{nM}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $K_i = 10.0~\\mathrm{nM}$. This value is of the same magnitude as $[E]_t = 10~\\mathrm{nM}$, confirming that this is indeed a case of tight-binding inhibition.\n\nFinally, we analyze the simplification in the limit of negligible enzyme concentration, $[E]_t \\to 0$.\nStarting from the derived expression:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nIf we assume $[E]_t$ is negligible, we set $[E]_t \\to 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} \\approx K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right)$$\nThis is the commonly used Cheng-Prusoff equation, which approximates $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ (total inhibitor concentration) with what is rigorously an expression for the free inhibitor concentration required for $50\\%$ inhibition.\n\nThis simplification fails for tight-binding inhibitors precisely because the premise ($[E]_t$ is negligible) is violated. The underlying physical assumption of the simplification is that the amount of inhibitor bound to the enzyme, $[EI]$, is a negligible fraction of the total inhibitor concentration, $[I]_t$. That is, $[I] \\approx [I]_t$.\nA tight-binding inhibitor is defined as one for which $K_i$ is close to or smaller than $[E]_t$. Let us examine the full equation: $\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = [I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} + [EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} = K_i(1 + [S]/K_m) + [E]_t/2$.\nFor a very tight binder ($K_i \\to 0$), the first term becomes very small, and the equation approaches its stoichiometric limit:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} \\to \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nThis means the measured $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ is determined not by the inhibitor's affinity ($K_i$) but by the concentration of the enzyme itself. To inhibit half the enzyme, one must add at least a stoichiometric amount of inhibitor equal to half the enzyme concentration.\nThe simplified Cheng-Prusoff equation, however, predicts $\\mathrm{IC}_{50} \\to 0$ as $K_i \\to 0$, which is physically incorrect. The failure occurs because for a tight binder, the condition $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} \\ll \\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ is not met. In fact, since $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} = [E]_t/2$ and $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ approaches $[E]_t/2$, the bound inhibitor can constitute nearly $100\\%$ of the total inhibitor at the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ point.\nIn the given problem, $[E]_t/2 = 5~\\mathrm{nM}$ while $\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = 19~\\mathrm{nM}$. The term $[E]_t/2$ accounts for $5/19 \\approx 26.3\\%$ of the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ value, which is not a negligible contribution. Using the simplified Cheng-Prusoff equation would yield $K_i \\approx \\frac{19~\\mathrm{nM}}{1.4} \\approx 13.6~\\mathrm{nM}$, an error of approximately $36\\%$ compared to the correct value of $10.0~\\mathrm{nM}$. The simplification fails because it ignores the significant sequestration of inhibitor by the enzyme, a cardinal feature of tight-binding interactions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.0}$$", "id": "2565938"}]}
