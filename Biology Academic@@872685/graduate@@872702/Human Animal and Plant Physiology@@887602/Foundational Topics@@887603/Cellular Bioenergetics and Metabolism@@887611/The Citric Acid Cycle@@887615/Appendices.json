Use only the following fundamental, widely accepted facts as your starting base:\n\n- Per mole of acetyl-CoA fully oxidized in the citric acid cycle, the net reduced cofactors and substrate-level phosphorylation generated in the mitochondrial matrix are: $3$ moles of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), $1$ mole of reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide ($FADH_2$), and $1$ mole of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) via substrate-level phosphorylation. In mammalian cells, $1$ mole of GTP is rapidly and reversibly converted to $1$ mole of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by nucleoside diphosphate kinase.\n- The phosphate-to-oxygen (P/O) ratio is defined as the number of moles of ATP synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation per pair of electrons donated by a reduced cofactor to the electron transport chain and transferred to molecular oxygen. Under the specified conditions, take the effective P/O ratios to be $2.5$ for NADH and $1.5$ for $FADH_2$.\n\nAssume that all reduced cofactors produced are reoxidized by the electron transport chain in the same mitochondrion and that transport and exchange processes do not change the stoichiometry stated above.\n\nTask:\n1.

The calculation must be based exclusively on the provided facts.\n\nLet $N_{ATP, total}$ represent the total moles of ATP synthesized per mole of acetyl-CoA oxidized. The total yield is the sum of ATP generated from three sources:\n$1$. Substrate-level phosphorylation.\n$2$. Oxidative phosphorylation driven by the reoxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH).\n$3$. Oxidative phosphorylation driven by the reoxidation of reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide ($FADH_2$).\n\nAccording to the provided information:\n- The moles of NADH produced per mole of acetyl-CoA is $n_{NADH} = 3$.\n- The moles of $FADH_2$ produced per mole of acetyl-CoA is $n_{FADH_2} = 1$.\n- The moles of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) produced via substrate-level phosphorylation per mole of acetyl-CoA is $n_{GTP} = 1$. It is also given that $1$ mole of GTP is equivalent to $1$ mole of ATP.\n\nThe effective P/O ratios are given as:\n- For NADH: $(P/O)_{NADH} = 2.5$ moles of ATP per mole of NADH reoxidized.\n- For $FADH_2$: $(P/O)_{FADH_2} = 1.5$ moles of ATP per mole of $FADH_2$ reoxidized.\n\nThe total ATP yield can be expressed as a linear combination of these contributions:\n$$N_{ATP, total} = (n_{GTP} \\times 1) + (n_{NADH} \\times (P/O)_{NADH}) + (n_{FADH_2} \\times (P/O)_{FADH_2})$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$N_{ATP, total} = (1 \\times 1) + (3 \\times 2.5) + (1 \\times 1.5)$$\n\nFirst, calculate the ATP yield from oxidative phosphorylation for each cofactor:\n- ATP from NADH: $3 \\text{ moles} \\times 2.5 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{mole}} = 7.5 \\text{ moles of ATP}$\n- ATP from $FADH_2$: $1 \\text{ mole} \\times 1.5 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{mole}} = 1.5 \\text{ moles of ATP}$\n\nNow, sum all contributions:\n$$N_{ATP, total} = 1 + 7.5 + 1.5$$\n$$N_{ATP, total} = 10$$\nTherefore, the theoretical yield is exactly $10$ moles of ATP equivalents per mole of acetyl-CoA oxidized under these conditions.\n\nFor the second part of the task, we analyze the influence of the P/O ratios. The derived expression for the total ATP yield, $N_{ATP, total} = n_{GTP} + n_{NADH}(P/O)_{NADH} + n_{FADH_2}(P/O)_{FADH_2}$, clearly shows a direct, linear dependence on the values of $(P/O)_{NADH}$ and $(P/O)_{FADH_2}$.\n\nIf the P/O ratios were to deviate from the stated values of $2.5$ and $1.5$, the total ATP yield would change accordingly. For instance, older textbooks often cite integer values of $3$ and $2$ for NADH and $FADH_2$, respectively. Using these historical values would result in a higher calculated yield:\n$$N_{ATP, total, old} = 1 + (3 \\times 3) + (1 \\times 2) = 1 + 9 + 2 = 12$$\nThis demonstrates that the energy yield is highly sensitive to the efficiency of coupling between the electron transport chain and ATP synthase.\n\nThe P/O ratios are empirical values and are not integers because the process is not perfectly stoichiometric. The proton-motive force generated by the electron transport chain is also used for processes other than ATP synthesis, such as the transport of ions and metabolites ($e.g.$, Pi, ADP, ATP) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, a phenomenon known as \"proton leak\" or \"slip\" occurs, where protons return to the matrix without passing through ATP synthase, dissipating the gradient as heat. Any physiological or pathological condition that increases the rate of proton leak (e.g., the action of uncoupling proteins) would decrease the effective P/O ratios, thereby lowering the ATP yield per mole of acetyl-CoA. Conversely, a state of tighter coupling would raise the P/O ratios towards their theoretical maxima, increasing the energy yield. Thus, the provided values of $2.5$ and $1.5$ represent a realistic, effective yield under typical physiological conditions, not a theoretical maximum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "2787191"}, {"introduction": "The flux through the citric acid cycle is not constant; it is exquisitely regulated to match the cell's metabolic state. This exercise zooms in on a critical control point: the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). You will use the principles of steady-state enzyme kinetics to quantitatively model how $NADH$, a product of the cycle, acts as a competitive inhibitor of IDH, providing a direct feedback mechanism that throttles the pathway when energy and reducing power are abundant [@problem_id:2787155].", "problem": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in the citric acid cycle catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate using Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD$^{+}$) as a co-substrate to produce Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (reduced form) (NADH). Consider mitochondrial conditions in which isocitrate is saturating, so that the reaction rate is effectively governed by NAD$^{+}$ binding and catalysis. Assume the following fundamental base: the Michaelis–Menten steady-state formalism for a single-substrate enzyme without inhibitor, and the classical competitive inhibition scheme in which inhibitor binds to free enzyme, increasing the apparent Michaelis constant but not changing the catalytic turnover capacity. In this system, NADH competitively inhibits IDH with respect to NAD$^{+}$ by binding at the nucleotide site.\n\nUnder these assumptions, let the uninhibited steady-state flux through IDH be determined by the usual Michaelis–Menten dependence on NAD$^{+}$ with Michaelis constant $K_{m}$ for NAD$^{+}$. When NADH is present at concentration $[I]$, it competes with NAD$^{+}$ with inhibition constant $K_{i}$, modifying the effective NAD$^{+}$ affinity. You are given the following experimentally constrained, scientifically plausible parameter values and metabolite concentrations for the mitochondrial matrix:\n- $K_{m}$ for NAD$^{+}$ binding to IDH: $0.10$ mM.\n- $K_{i}$ for NADH (competitive with NAD$^{+}$): $0.050$ mM.\n- Free NAD$^{+}$ concentration $[S]$: $0.30$ mM.\n- Free NADH concentration $[I]$: $0.20$ mM.\n- The catalytic capacity $V_{\\max}$ is unchanged by competitive inhibition.\n\nStarting from the stated steady-state enzyme kinetics base, derive an expression for the ratio of inhibited to uninhibited flux, $r \\equiv v_{\\text{inh}}/v_{0}$, in terms of $K_{m}$, $K_{i}$, $[S]$, and $[I]$, and then evaluate $r$ using the values above.
