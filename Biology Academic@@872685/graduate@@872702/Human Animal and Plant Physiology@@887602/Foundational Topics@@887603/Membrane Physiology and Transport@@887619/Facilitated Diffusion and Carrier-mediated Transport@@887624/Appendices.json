Consider a minimal four-state cycle with outward-facing empty carrier $E_o$, outward-facing glucose-bound $E_oS$, inward-facing glucose-bound $E_iS$, and inward-facing empty $E_i$. Binding and unbinding on each side follow mass-action kinetics with association rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and dissociation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, and glucose-bound carriers undergo conformational translocation at rate $k_t$ in either direction. Empty carriers interconvert at rate $k_e$ in either direction. Assume symmetry of the transporter (identical parameters on both sides), steady state, and that the membrane potential does not affect transport because glucose is uncharged.\n\nLet the total carrier concentration be $E_T$, the extracellular glucose concentration be $C_o$ (expressed in millimolar), and the intracellular free glucose concentration (maintained low by rapid hexokinase activity) be clamped at $C_i$ (millimolar).

It is well-posed and objective. The tasks are mathematically tractable given the framework. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $\\Phi(C_o, C_i; K_m)$\n\nThe kinetic scheme for the symmetric four-state carrier is described by the following reactions:\n1. Outward binding/unbinding: $E_o + S_o \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{\\mathrm{off}}]{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} E_oS$, where the concentration of external substrate $S_o$ is $C_o$.\n2.

Empty carrier translocation: $E_o \\xrightleftharpoons[k_e]{k_e} E_i$.\n\nAt steady state, the net flux $J$ through each step of the cycle must be equal. The net flux is defined as the net rate of substrate moving from the outside ($o$) to the inside ($i$):\n$$J = k_t[E_oS] - k_t[E_iS]$$\nA full derivation from the steady-state equations for all four states is algebraically intensive and yields a complex expression. However, the problem specifies an empirical form $J = J_{\\max}\\Phi(C_o, C_i; K_m)$, which suggests a simpler structure. This simpler structure can be rigorously derived under a set of kinetically reasonable assumptions which are often implicit in textbook treatments of this model. We shall make these assumptions explicit:\n- Assumption 1: Substrate binding and dissociation are very rapid compared to translocation steps. This is the rapid-equilibrium assumption. This means $k_{\\mathrm{on}}, k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\gg k_t, k_e$. This implies that the binding sites are always in equilibrium with the adjacent bulk solution:\n$$ [E_oS] = \\frac{[E_o]C_o}{K_D} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [E_iS] = \\frac{[E_i]C_i}{K_D} $$\nwhere $K_D = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the substrate dissociation constant.\n\n- Assumption 2: The translocation of the empty carrier is very fast compared to the loaded carrier, i.e., $k_e \\gg k_t$. This means the reorientation of the empty carrier is not a rate-limiting step. The steady-state condition on the flux of empty carrier, $J = k_e([E_i] - [E_o])$, implies that for a finite flux $J$, if $k_e \\to \\infty$, then $[E_i] \\approx [E_o]$.\n\nWith these two assumptions, we can derive the flux equation.\nThe net flux is given by:\n$$ J = k_t([E_oS] - [E_iS]) = k_t \\left( \\frac{[E_o]C_o}{K_D} - \\frac{[E_i]C_i}{K_D} \\right) $$\nUsing $[E_i] \\approx [E_o]$, this becomes:\n$$ J = \\frac{k_t}{K_D} [E_o] (C_o - C_i) $$\nNext, we use the conservation of total carrier concentration, $E_T$:\n$$ E_T = [E_o] + [E_i] + [E_oS] + [E_iS] $$\nSubstituting the assumptions:\n$$ E_T \\approx [E_o] + [E_o] + \\frac{[E_o]C_o}{K_D} + \\frac{[E_o]C_i}{K_D} = [E_o] \\left( 2 + \\frac{C_o+C_i}{K_D} \\right) $$\nFrom this, we solve for $[E_o]$:\n$$ [E_o] = \\frac{E_T}{2 + (C_o+C_i)/K_D} $$\nSubstitute this back into the expression for the flux $J$:\n$$ J = \\frac{k_t}{K_D} \\frac{E_T (C_o - C_i)}{2 + (C_o+C_i)/K_D} = \\frac{k_t E_T (C_o - C_i)}{2K_D + C_o + C_i} $$\nThis expression can be matched to the empirical form $J = J_{\\max}\\Phi(C_o, C_i; K_m)$.\nWe find $J_{\\max}$ by taking the limit $C_o \\to \\infty$ at fixed $C_i$:\n$$ J_{\\max} = \\lim_{C_o \\to \\infty} \\frac{k_t E_T (C_o - C_i)}{2K_D + C_o + C_i} = \\lim_{C_o \\to \\infty} \\frac{k_t E_T (1 - C_i/C_o)}{2K_D/C_o + 1 + C_i/C_o} = k_t E_T $$\nBy comparing the derived flux expression with the empirical form, we identify the Michaelis constant $K_m$ and the function $\\Phi$:\n$$ J = \\frac{J_{\\max} (C_o - C_i)}{K_m + C_o + C_i} $$\nwhere we have made the identifications $J_{\\max} = k_t E_T$ and $K_m = 2K_D$.\nThus, the function $\\Phi$ is:\n$$ \\Phi(C_o, C_i; K_m) = \\frac{C_o - C_i}{K_m + C_o + C_i} $$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Net Influx $J$\n\nUsing the derived expression for $J$ and the provided parameters:\n$J_{\\max} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-16}$ mol s$^{-1}$ cell$^{-1}$, $K_m = 3.00$ mM, and $C_i = 0.0500$ mM.\nThe flux equation is:\n$$ J(C_o) = (1.20 \\times 10^{-16}) \\frac{C_o - 0.0500}{3.00 + C_o + 0.0500} = (1.20 \\times 10^{-16}) \\frac{C_o - 0.0500}{3.05 + C_o} $$\n1.

We address each task in sequence.\n\n## Task 1: Derivation of Flux Density Expressions\n\n### Simple Diffusion Flux Density, $J_{\\mathrm{diff}}(\\Delta C)$\nAccording to Fick's first law as applied to membrane transport at steady state, the net flux density due to simple diffusion is directly proportional to the concentration difference across the membrane. The constant of proportionality is the membrane permeability, $P$.\nThe flux is from the region of higher concentration to the region of lower concentration. Given $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$ as the extracellular and intracellular concentrations, respectively, the net flux density into the cell is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{diff}} = P (C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}})$$\nThe problem defines the concentration difference as $\\Delta C \\equiv C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Substituting this definition, we obtain the expression for the simple diffusion flux density as a function of $\\Delta C$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{diff}}(\\Delta C) = P \\Delta C$$\nThis is a linear relationship.\n\n### Carrier-Mediated Flux Density, $J_{\\mathrm{car}}(\\Delta C)$\nThe problem specifies a symmetric, reversible uniporter with rapid equilibrium binding. The net flux density is stated to be proportional to the difference in the fractional occupancies of the carrier's binding sites on the extracellular ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{out}}$) and intracellular ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{in}}$) sides of the membrane. The maximal transport capacity, $J_{\\max}$, serves as the proportionality constant.\n$$J_{\\mathrm{car}} = J_{\\max} (\\theta_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{in}})$$\nThe fractional occupancy at each side follows standard saturation kinetics, analogous to a Michaelis-Menten model, where the dissociation constant is denoted $K_{m}$ (equivalent to $K_{d}$). The occupancies are:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{out}}}{K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{out}}}$$\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{in}}}{K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $J_{\\mathrm{car}}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{car}} = J_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{out}}}{K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{out}}} - \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{in}}}{K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right)$$\nTo find a common denominator and simplify:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{car}} = J_{\\max} \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{out}}(K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{in}}) - C_{\\mathrm{in}}(K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{out}})}{(K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{out}})(K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{in}})}$$\nExpanding the terms in the numerator:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{out}}K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{out}}C_{\\mathrm{in}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}}K_{m} - C_{\\mathrm{in}}C_{\\mathrm{out}} = K_{m}(C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}})$$\nThis simplification yields the general expression for the carrier-mediated flux density:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{car}} = \\frac{J_{\\max} K_{m} (C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}})}{(K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{out}})(K_{m} + C_{\\mathrm{in}})}$$\nThe problem requires this expression as a function of $\\Delta C$, using the given parameters $J_{\\max}$, $K_{m}$, and the clamped intracellular concentration $C_{\\mathrm{in}} = C_{i,0}$.

Let the dissociation constants be $K_o$ for $S$ binding to $E_o$ and $K_i$ for $S$ binding to $E_i$.\n\n- The rate-limiting step for translocation under the conditions considered is the isomerization of the loaded carrier from outside to inside with first-order rate constant $k_{+}$ (for $E_oS \\to E_iS$) and from inside to outside with rate constant $k_{-}$ (for $E_iS \\to E_oS$). For Hypothesis U only, empty-carrier isomerization between $E_o \\leftrightarrow E_i$ occurs with first-order rate constants $h_{+}$ (for $E_o \\to E_i$) and $h_{-}$ (for $E_i \\to E_o$).\n\n- Initial-rate conditions: Substrate concentrations on the two sides are clamped to $[S_o]$ (outside) and $[S_i]$ (inside), and the initial unidirectional influx $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is defined as the time derivative of intracellular $S$ arising from outside-to-inside carrier-mediated transport at $t \\to 0^{+}$ when $[S_o]$ and $[S_i]$ are fixed.\n\nUse these bases to analyze the following two experimental protocols:\n\n- Zero-trans influx: $[S_i] = 0$, $[S_o]$ varied.\n\n- Trans-stimulation: $[S_o]$ fixed at a nonzero value and $[S_i]$ is increased from $0$.\n\nBy constructing and analyzing the kinetic occupancy of $E_oS$ under the rapid-equilibrium binding approximation and the allowed isomerization steps, determine which statements below are necessarily true. Choose all that apply.\n\nA. Under zero-trans influx ($[S_i]=0$), Hypothesis X predicts $J_{\\mathrm{in}} \\equiv 0$ for all $[S_o]  0$.\n\nB. Under zero-trans influx ($[S_i]=0$), Hypothesis U predicts a strictly positive, saturable $J_{\\mathrm{in}}([S_o])$; moreover, an increase in $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ upon raising $[S_i]$ at fixed $[S_o]$ (trans-stimulation) can occur under Hypothesis U and therefore, by itself, does not diagnose obligate exchange.\n\nC. If $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ increases strictly linearly with $[S_i]$ at low $[S_i]$ while $[S_o]$ is fixed, this alone proves that the carrier is an obligate exchanger (Hypothesis X).\n\nD. The combined observation that $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is identically zero at $[S_i]=0$ for all $[S_o]0$ and that $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ increases as $[S_i]$ is raised at fixed $[S_o]$ is sufficient to conclude that the carrier operates as an obligate exchanger (Hypothesis X) under the tested conditions.\n\nE. For Hypothesis U, $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ at fixed $[S_o]$ must be a monotonically decreasing function of $[S_i]$, because inside $S$ only competes with outside $S$ for binding to the carrier and cannot accelerate influx.", "solution": "The problem requires a critical analysis of two kinetic models for carrier-mediated transport: Hypothesis U (reversible uniport) and Hypothesis X (obligate exchange). The analysis must be based on the provided assumptions, primarily the rapid-equilibrium binding approximation. The goal is to determine which of the given statements are necessarily true. The influx, $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is the unidirectional flux from outside to inside, given by $J_{\\mathrm{in}} = k_{+}[E_oS]$.\n\nFirst, we must derive the general expression for the steady-state concentration of the carrier-substrate complex on the outer side, $[E_oS]$, as a function of the external and internal substrate concentrations, $[S_o]$ and $[S_i]$.\n\n**General Framework**\n\nThe total concentration of the carrier is constant:\n$$E_T = [E_o] + [E_i] + [E_oS] + [E_iS]$$\nThe rapid-equilibrium binding approximation gives:\n$$[E_oS] = \\frac{[E_o][S_o]}{K_o}$$\n$$[E_iS] = \\frac{[E_i][S_i]}{K_i}$$\nLet's define the normalized substrate concentrations $\\sigma_o = [S_o]/K_o$ and $\\sigma_i = [S_i]/K_i$. The binding equilibria become $[E_oS] = [E_o]\\sigma_o$ and $[E_iS] = [E_i]\\sigma_i$.\nSubstituting these into the conservation equation yields:\n$$E_T = [E_o](1 + \\sigma_o) + [E_i](1 + \\sigma_i)$$\nAt steady state, the total rate of carrier reorientation from the outside-facing conformations to the inside-facing ones must equal the rate in the reverse direction:\n$$\\text{Rate}(\\text{out} \\to \\text{in}) = h_{+}[E_o] + k_{+}[E_oS]$$\n$$\\text{Rate}(\\text{in} \\to \\text{out}) = h_{-}[E_i] + k_{-}[E_iS]$$\nEquating these rates and using the binding relations:\n$$h_{+}[E_o] + k_{+}[E_o]\\sigma_o = h_{-}[E_i] + k_{-}[E_i]\\sigma_i$$\n$$[E_o](h_{+} + k_{+}\\sigma_o) = [E_i](h_{-} + k_{-}\\sigma_i)$$\nThis provides the second equation needed to solve for $[E_o]$ and $[E_i]$.\n\n**Hypothesis U (Reversible Uniport)**\n\nFor this hypothesis, all rate constants ($h_{+}, h_{-}, k_{+}, k_{-}$) are non-zero. From the steady-state equation:\n$$[E_i] = [E_o] \\frac{h_{+} + k_{+}\\sigma_o}{h_{-} + k_{-}\\sigma_i}$$\nSubstituting this into the conservation equation allows us to solve for $[E_o]$:\n$$E_T = [E_o](1 + \\sigma_o) + [E_o] \\frac{h_{+} + k_{+}\\sigma_o}{h_{-} + k_{-}\\sigma_i} (1+\\sigma_i)$$\n$$[E_o] = \\frac{E_T (h_{-} + k_{-}\\sigma_i)}{(1+\\sigma_o)(h_{-} + k_{-}\\sigma_i) + (1+\\sigma_i)(h_{+} + k_{+}\\sigma_o)}$$\nThe influx is $J_{\\mathrm{in, U}} = k_{+}[E_oS] = k_{+}[E_o]\\sigma_o$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{in, U}} = \\frac{k_{+} E_T \\sigma_o (h_{-} + k_{-}\\sigma_i)}{(1+\\sigma_o)(h_{-} + k_{-}\\sigma_i) + (1+\\sigma_i)(h_{+} + k_{+}\\sigma_o)}$$\n\n**Hypothesis X (Obligate Exchange)**\n\nFor this hypothesis, reorientation of the empty carrier is forbidden, so $h_{+} = 0$ and $h_{-} = 0$. The general uniport equation simplifies by setting these constants to zero:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{in, X}} = \\frac{k_{+} E_T \\sigma_o (k_{-}\\sigma_i)}{(1+\\sigma_o)(k_{-}\\sigma_i) + (1+\\sigma_i)(k_{+}\\sigma_o)}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{in, X}} = \\frac{k_{+} k_{-} E_T \\sigma_o \\sigma_i}{k_{+}\\sigma_o + k_{-}\\sigma_i + (k_{+} + k_{-})\\sigma_o \\sigma_i}$$\nSubstituting back $\\sigma_o = [S_o]/K_o$ and $\\sigma_i = [S_i]/K_i$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{in, X}} = \\frac{ \\frac{k_{+} k_{-} E_T}{K_o K_i} [S_o][S_i] }{ \\frac{k_{+}}{K_o}[S_o] + \\frac{k_{-}}{K_i}[S_i] + \\frac{k_{+}+k_{-}}{K_o K_i}[S_o][S_i] }$$\n\nWith these expressions, we can evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Under zero-trans influx ($[S_i]=0$), Hypothesis X predicts $J_{\\mathrm{in}} \\equiv 0$ for all $[S_o]  0$.**\nTo evaluate this, we set $[S_i]=0$ (and thus $\\sigma_i=0$) in the expression for $J_{\\mathrm{in, X}}$. The numerator contains the term $[S_o][S_i]$, which becomes zero. The denominator, for $[S_o]0$, is non-zero ($k_{+}[S_o]/K_o  0$). Therefore, $J_{\\mathrm{in, X}} = 0$ when $[S_i]=0$ for any $[S_o]0$. This is because after one translocation event ($E_oS \\to E_iS$), the substrate unbinds inside, leaving the carrier as $E_i$. With no internal substrate to exchange and no path for empty carrier reorientation ($E_i \\to E_o$ is forbidden), the carrier is trapped on the inside, and transport ceases.\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under zero-trans influx ($[S_i]=0$), Hypothesis U predicts a strictly positive, saturable $J_{\\mathrm{in}}([S_o])$; moreover, an increase in $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ upon raising $[S_i]$ at fixed $[S_o]$ (trans-stimulation) can occur under Hypothesis U and therefore, by itself, does not diagnose obligate exchange.**\nFor Hypothesis U, setting $[S_i]=0$ ($\\sigma_i=0$) gives the zero-trans influx:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{in, U}}([S_i]=0) = \\frac{k_{+} E_T \\sigma_o h_{-}}{(1+\\sigma_o)h_{-} + (h_{+} + k_{+}\\sigma_o)} = \\frac{k_{+} E_T h_{-} ([S_o]/K_o)}{h_{-} + h_{+} + (h_{-} + k_{+})([S_o]/K_o)}$$\nThis expression has the form of a Michaelis-Menten equation with respect to $[S_o]$. For $[S_o]0$, since all constants ($k_{+}, E_T, h_{-}, K_o, h_{+}$) are positive, $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is strictly positive and saturates at high $[S_o]$. This confirms the first part of the statement.\nFor the second part, we check if trans-stimulation is possible. This requires evaluating the sign of the derivative $\\frac{\\partial J_{\\mathrm{in,U}}}{\\partial [S_i]}$ at $[S_i]=0$. The sign is determined by the sign of $\\frac{\\partial J_{\\mathrm{in,U}}}{\\partial \\sigma_i}$ at $\\sigma_i=0$. The derivative of the numerator of $J_{\\mathrm{in,U}}$ with respect to $\\sigma_i$ is $k_{-}$, while the derivative of the denominator is $k_{-}(1+\\sigma_o) + (h_{+}+k_{+}\\sigma_o)$. Using the quotient rule and evaluating at $\\sigma_i=0$, the sign of the derivative of $J_{\\mathrm{in,U}}$ matches the sign of $(k_{-} - h_{-})$. If the reorientation of the loaded carrier from inside to out ($k_{-}$) is faster than the reorientation of the empty carrier ($h_{-}$), then $\\frac{\\partial J_{\\mathrm{in,U}}}{\\partial [S_i]}  0$. In this case, adding a small amount of substrate on the trans-side accelerates the return of the carrier to the outside, thus stimulating influx. Since trans-stimulation is possible for a uniport, observing it is not, by itself, sufficient proof of an obligate exchange mechanism.\n**Verdict for B: Correct.**\n\n**C. If $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ increases strictly linearly with $[S_i]$ at low $[S_i]$ while $[S_o]$ is fixed, this alone proves that the carrier is an obligate exchanger (Hypothesis X).**\nA function $f(x)$ that \"increases strictly linearly with $x$\" is of the form $f(x)=cx$ where $c$ is a positive constant. For a function of a biological process, this language refers to the behavior at the limit $x \\to 0$, meaning $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=c0$.\nFor Hypothesis U, the zero-trans flux ($[S_i]=0$) is strictly positive, $J_{\\mathrm{in,U}}(0)  0$. Thus, it cannot increase linearly from the origin.\nFor Hypothesis X, $J_{\\mathrm{in,X}}(0) = 0$. The function is $J_{\\mathrm{in, X}}([S_i]) = \\frac{A [S_i]}{B + C[S_i]}$, where $A, B, C$ are positive constants at fixed $[S_o]$. This is not a strictly linear function because its second derivative is non-zero. The term \"strictly linearly\" implies the function itself is a line, not merely approximated by one. A saturating curve is fundamentally non-linear. Therefore, the premise of the statement is not met by either model if interpreted with full mathematical rigor. The language \"strictly linearly\" is too strong for the hyperbolic dependence predicted by the model.\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The combined observation that $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is identically zero at $[S_i]=0$ for all $[S_o]0$ and that $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ increases as $[S_i]$ is raised at fixed $[S_o]$ is sufficient to conclude that the carrier operates as an obligate exchanger (Hypothesis X) under the tested conditions.**\nThis statement presents two experimental findings.\n1. $J_{\\mathrm{in}}([S_i]=0) \\equiv 0$ for all $[S_o]0$. As shown for statement B, for Hypothesis U, $J_{\\mathrm{in}}([S_i]=0)  0$. This observation thus unequivocally rules out Hypothesis U. As shown for statement A, this observation is a defining prediction of Hypothesis X.\n2. At fixed $[S_o]$, $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ increases as $[S_i]$ is raised from $0$. For Hypothesis X, $J_{\\mathrm{in,X}}$ increases from $0$ as $[S_i]$ increases; its derivative with respect to $[S_i]$ at $[S_i]=0$ is positive. This observation confirms the carrier is functional.\nSince the observations are inconsistent with Hypothesis U and fully consistent with Hypothesis X, and the problem restricts the possibilities to these two hypotheses, these findings are sufficient to conclude the mechanism is obligate exchange.\n**Verdict for D: Correct.**\n\n**E. For Hypothesis U, $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ at fixed $[S_o]$ must be a monotonically decreasing function of $[S_i]$, because inside $S$ only competes with outside $S$ for binding to the carrier and cannot accelerate influx.**\nThe reasoning provided in this statement is a common but incorrect intuition. As demonstrated in the analysis of statement B, if the rate constant for the return of the loaded carrier, $k_{-}$, is greater than that for the empty carrier, $h_{-}$, then the addition of internal substrate $[S_i]$ can accelerate the overall transport cycle by shunting the carrier into a faster return pathway. This leads to an increase in influx (trans-stimulation). Therefore, $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is not necessarily a monotonically decreasing function of $[S_i]$; it can increase, at least initially. The provided reasoning is flawed.\n**Verdict for E: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal correct options are A, B, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2567591"}]}
