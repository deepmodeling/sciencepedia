It is well-posed, providing all necessary information and consistent assumptions for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The numerical values provided are physically realistic for a biological membrane system. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nWe begin with Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension, which governs the flux $J$ of the solute within the membrane:\n$$J = -D_{m} \\frac{dC_{m}(x)}{dx}$$\nHere, $C_{m}(x)$ is the concentration of the solute within the membrane at position $x$. At steady state, the flux $J$ must be constant for all $x$ within the membrane ($0 < x < L_{m}$). Since $D_{m}$ is also given as a constant, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC_{m}(x)}{dx}$ must be constant as well. This implies a linear concentration profile for the solute across the membrane.\n\nWe can integrate the equation across the membrane's thickness, from $x=0$ to $x=L_{m}$:\n$$J \\int_{0}^{L_{m}} dx = -D_{m} \\int_{C_{m}(0)}^{C_{m}(L_{m})} dC_{m}$$\nThis yields:\n$$J L_{m} = -D_{m} [C_{m}(L_{m}) - C_{m}(0)]$$\nRearranging for the flux $J$:\n$$J = \\frac{D_{m}}{L_{m}} [C_{m}(0) - C_{m}(L_{m})]$$\nThe problem states that there is rapid local equilibrium at the two water-membrane interfaces. This equilibrium is described by the partition coefficient $K$, defined as $K = C_{m}/C_{w}$. Thus, the concentrations just inside the membrane, $C_{m}(0)$ and $C_{m}(L_{m})$, are related to the concentrations just outside in the aqueous phase, $C_{w,1}$ and $C_{w,2}$:\n$$C_{m}(0) = K \\cdot C_{w,1}$$\n$$C_{m}(L_{m}) = K \\cdot C_{w,2}$$\nA crucial assumption is the absence of significant unstirred boundary layers in the aqueous phases. This allows us to equate the interfacial aqueous concentrations with the bulk aqueous concentrations $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$:\n$$C_{w,1} = C_{1}$$\n$$C_{w,2} = C_{2}$$\nSubstituting these relations into the expressions for the intramembrane concentrations gives:\n$$C_{m}(0) = K \\cdot C_{1}$$\n$$C_{m}(L_{m}) = K \\cdot C_{2}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the equation for the flux $J$:\n$$J = \\frac{D_{m}}{L_{m}} (K \\cdot C_{1} - K \\cdot C_{2}) = \\frac{K D_{m}}{L_{m}} (C_{1} - C_{2})$$\nThe permeability of the membrane, $P$, is phenomenologically defined as the proportionality constant relating the flux to the difference in bulk aqueous concentrations:\n$$J = P (C_{1} - C_{2})$$\nBy comparing this definition with the derived expression for $J$, we identify the analytical expression for the permeability $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{K D_{m}}{L_{m}}$$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate $P$ numerically.

It is a standard problem in transport biophysics. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system consists of three compartments in series: a well-mixed bulk phase with solute concentration $c_{b}$, a quiescent Unstirred Layer (UL) of thickness $\\delta$, and a cell with a fixed internal concentration $c_{i}$. Transport of the solute is one-dimensional and at steady state. Let the coordinate $x$ be normal to the membrane, with $x=0$ at the interface between the bulk solution and the UL, and $x=\\delta$ at the interface between the UL and the outer surface of the plasma membrane. The concentration at $x=0$ is that of the bulk phase, $c(0) = c_{b}$. The concentration at the outer surface of the membrane, at $x=\\delta$, we denote as $c_{m,o}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the permeability of the Unstirred Layer, $P_{\\mathrm{UL}}$.\nThe transport across the UL is governed by Fick's first law in one dimension:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The problem states that the system is at steady state, which means the flux $J$ must be constant for all values of $x$ within the UL. Consequently, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ must also be constant. This implies that the concentration profile $c(x)$ across the UL is linear.\n\nThe constant gradient can therefore be written as the total concentration difference across the layer divided by its thickness:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{c(\\delta) - c(0)}{\\delta - 0} = \\frac{c_{m,o} - c_{b}}{\\delta}$$\nSubstituting this expression for the gradient into Fick's law gives the flux across the UL, which we denote $J_{\\mathrm{UL}}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{UL}} = -D \\left( \\frac{c_{m,o} - c_{b}}{\\delta} \\right) = \\frac{D}{\\delta} (c_{b} - c_{m,o})$$\nThe problem defines permeability, $P$, through the relation $J = P \\Delta c$, where $\\Delta c$ is the concentration difference across the barrier. For the UL, the flux is $J_{\\mathrm{UL}}$ and the concentration difference is $\\Delta c_{\\mathrm{UL}} = c_b - c_{m,o}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{UL}} = P_{\\mathrm{UL}}(c_b - c_{m,o})$$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $J_{\\mathrm{UL}}$, we can directly identify the permeability of the Unstirred Layer:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{UL}} = \\frac{D}{\\delta}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nSecond, we derive the composite permeability, $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, for the UL and the membrane in series.\nThe flux across the membrane, $J_m$, is given by its intrinsic permeability, $P_m$, and the concentration difference across it. This difference is between the outer surface concentration, $c_{m,o}$, and the fixed cytosolic concentration, $c_i$:\n$$J_m = P_m (c_{m,o} - c_i)$$\nAt steady state, the flux must be continuous throughout the system, meaning the flux across the UL must equal the flux across the membrane, and this common flux is the total flux, $J$. So, $J = J_{\\mathrm{UL}} = J_m$.\nWe now have a system of two equations involving the unknown intermediate concentration $c_{m,o}$:\n$$J = P_{\\mathrm{UL}}(c_b - c_{m,o})$$\n$$J = P_m(c_{m,o} - c_i)$$\nWe can rearrange these equations to express the concentration drops across each barrier in terms of the flux:\n$$c_b - c_{m,o} = \\frac{J}{P_{\\mathrm{UL}}}$$\n$$c_{m,o} - c_i = \\frac{J}{P_m}$$\nAdding these two equations eliminates $c_{m,o}$ and gives the total concentration drop across the entire system, $c_b - c_i$:\n$$(c_b - c_{m,o}) + (c_{m,o} - c_i) = \\frac{J}{P_{\\mathrm{UL}}} + \\frac{J}{P_m}$$\n$$c_b - c_i = J \\left( \\frac{1}{P_{\\mathrm{UL}}} + \\frac{1}{P_m} \\right)$$\nThe overall flux $J$ is related to the total permeability, $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, and the total concentration difference, $c_b - c_i$, by the definitional relationship $J = P_{\\mathrm{tot}}(c_b - c_i)$. Comparing this with our derived expression for $J$, we find the relationship for the total permeability:\n$$\\frac{1}{P_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{P_{\\mathrm{UL}}} + \\frac{1}{P_m}$$\nThis demonstrates that the resistances to transport ($R = 1/P$) for barriers in series are additive: $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = R_{\\mathrm{UL}} + R_m$. The composite permeability is explicitly $P_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{UL}}P_m}{P_{\\mathrm{UL}} + P_m}$.\n\nThe Unstirred Layer limits the overall flux when its resistance to transport, $R_{\\mathrm{UL}} = 1/P_{\\mathrm{UL}}$, is the dominant contribution to the total resistance. This occurs when its resistance is greater than the membrane's resistance, $R_m = 1/P_m$. Therefore, the condition for the UL being the flux-limiting barrier is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{UL}} > R_m$$\nSubstituting the permeability definitions, we have:\n$$\\frac{1}{P_{\\mathrm{UL}}} > \\frac{1}{P_m}$$\nSince permeabilities are positive quantities, this inequality is equivalent to:\n$$P_m > P_{\\mathrm{UL}}$$\nThis is the condition under which the Unstirred Layer limits the overall flux. Intuitively, if the membrane is highly permeable ($P_m$ is large), the bottleneck becomes the rate at which the solute can diffuse through the UL to reach the membrane.\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical evaluation of $P_{\\mathrm{UL}}$.\nThe problem provides the parameters $D = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$ and $\\delta = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.

The numerical values are plausible. However, the statement \"each path has the same thickness\" is ambiguous and requires careful interpretation to ensure the problem is well-posed.\n\nLet us define permeability. Starting from Fick's first law for steady-state diffusion across a homogeneous slab of thickness $L$ and diffusion coefficient $D$, the flux $J$ is constant:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} \\implies \\int_0^L J\\,dx = -\\int_{C_{in}}^{C_{out}} D\\,dC$$\nFor constant $D$, this gives $J L = -D (C_{out} - C_{in}) = D (C_{in} - C_{out})$. Defining the concentration difference as $\\Delta C = C_{in} - C_{out}$, we have $J = \\frac{D}{L}\\Delta C$.\nThe permeability $P$ of the slab is defined by the linear relation $J = P \\Delta C$. Therefore, for a slab of thickness $L$, its permeability is $P = D/L$. This shows that permeability is dependent on thickness.\n\nThe given values $P_1$ and $P_2$ must correspond to a specific thickness. The most logical and self-contained interpretation of \"each path has the same thickness\" is that the fundamental building blocks—a layer of Material A and a layer of Material B—both have this same characteristic thickness, which we will denote as $L$.\n-   A layer of Material A of thickness $L$ has permeability $P_1 = D_1/L$.\n-   A layer of Material B of thickness $L$ has permeability $P_2 = D_2/L$.\n\nWith this interpretation, the architectures are defined as:\n-   **Architecture P (parallel):** The barrier consists of Material A and Material B side-by-side, each with thickness $L$. The total barrier thickness is $L$.\n-   **Architecture S (series):** The barrier consists of a layer of Material A (thickness $L$) stacked on a layer of Material B (thickness $L$). The total barrier thickness is $2L$.\n\nThis interpretation makes the problem well-posed and solvable without any external assumptions. Other interpretations, such as assuming equal total barrier thickness, would require knowledge of a reference thickness for the given permeabilities, which is not provided, thus rendering the problem underspecified.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid under the explicit interpretation outlined above. Proceeding to solution.\n\n**Derivation of Effective Permeabilities**\n\n**Architecture P (Parallel)**\nIn the parallel configuration, the barrier has a uniform thickness $L$. It is composed of two sections, one of Material A and one of Material B, with cross-sectional areas $A_1 = A_{total}/2$ and $A_2 = A_{total}/2$. Both sections are subject to the same concentration difference $\\Delta C$.\n\nThe total flow rate of solute, $\\Phi_{total}$, is the sum of the flow rates through each section:\n$$\\Phi_{total} = \\Phi_1 + \\Phi_2$$\nThe flow rate through a section is its flux multiplied by its area, $\\Phi_i = J_i A_i$. The flux through each section is given by $J_1 = P_1 \\Delta C$ and $J_2 = P_2 \\Delta C$.\n$$\\Phi_{total} = (P_1 \\Delta C) A_1 + (P_2 \\Delta C) A_2$$\nSubstituting $A_1 = A_2 = A_{total}/2$:\n$$\\Phi_{total} = (P_1 \\Delta C) \\frac{A_{total}}{2} + (P_2 \\Delta C) \\frac{A_{total}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(P_1 + P_2) \\Delta C A_{total}$$\nThe effective flux for the parallel barrier is $J_{\\mathrm{eff,P}} = \\Phi_{total} / A_{total}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{eff,P}} = \\frac{1}{2}(P_1 + P_2) \\Delta C$$\nThe effective permeability $P_{\\mathrm{eff,P}}$ is defined by $J_{\\mathrm{eff,P}} = P_{\\mathrm{eff,P}} \\Delta C$. Thus, we derive:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{eff,P}} = \\frac{1}{2}(P_1 + P_2)$$\nThis is the area-weighted arithmetic mean of the individual permeabilities.\n\n**Architecture S (Series)**\nIn the series configuration, the solute must pass sequentially through a layer of Material A (thickness $L$, permeability $P_1$) and a layer of Material B (thickness $L$, permeability $P_2$).\n\nIn steady state, the flux $J_S$ is constant throughout the composite barrier. The total concentration difference $\\Delta C$ across the entire barrier ($2L$ thickness) is the sum of the concentration differences across each layer, $\\Delta C_A$ and $\\Delta C_B$:\n$$\\Delta C = \\Delta C_A + \\Delta C_B$$\nThe flux through each layer is related to its respective concentration drop and permeability:\n$$J_S = P_1 \\Delta C_A \\implies \\Delta C_A = \\frac{J_S}{P_1}$$\n$$J_S = P_2 \\Delta C_B \\implies \\Delta C_B = \\frac{J_S}{P_2}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the total concentration drop:\n$$\\Delta C = \\frac{J_S}{P_1} + \\frac{J_S}{P_2} = J_S \\left(\\frac{1}{P_1} + \\frac{1}{P_2}\\right)$$\nThe effective permeability of the series barrier, $P_{\\mathrm{eff,S}}$, is defined by the relation for the overall barrier: $J_S = P_{\\mathrm{eff,S}} \\Delta C$. Rearranging the previous equation to solve for $J_S/\\Delta C$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{eff,S}} = \\frac{J_S}{\\Delta C} = \\left(\\frac{1}{P_1} + \\frac{1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{eff,S}} = \\frac{P_1 P_2}{P_1 + P_2}$$\nThis is related to the harmonic mean of the permeabilities. It is equivalent to adding the transport resistances of the layers, where the resistance of a layer is $R_i = 1/P_i$.\n\n**Ratio and Mechanistic Justification**\nThe ratio $r$ is defined as $r \\equiv P_{\\mathrm{eff,P}} / P_{\\mathrm{eff,S}}$. Substituting the derived expressions:\n$$r = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(P_1 + P_2)}{\\frac{P_1 P_2}{P_1 + P_2}} = \\frac{(P_1 + P_2)^2}{2 P_1 P_2}$$\n\nMechanistically, the parallel architecture always yields a higher effective permeability than the series architecture (for non-equal $P_1, P_2$). This is because transport is analogous to electrical current.\n-   In **series**, resistances ($1/P$) add. The total resistance is dominated by the larger resistance, which corresponds to the layer with the lower permeability ($P_2$). This low-permeability layer acts as a bottleneck, severely limiting the overall flux, regardless of how permeable the other layer is.\n-   In **parallel**, conductances ($P$, weighted by area) add. The solute has multiple pathways. The high-permeability pathway ($P_1$) acts as a low-resistance shunt, allowing a large amount of solute to bypass the low-permeability path. The total transport is high because the high-conductance path contributes significantly.\n\nMathematically, the inequality of arithmetic and harmonic means guarantees that $P_{\\mathrm{eff,P}} > P_{\\mathrm{eff,S}}$ when $P_1 \\neq P_2$. Our derived ratio $r = \\frac{(P_1+P_2)^2}{2P_1P_2} = \\frac{P_1^2+2P_1P_2+P_2^2}{2P_1P_2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2} + \\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right) + 1$. From the AM-GM inequality, $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} + \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\ge 2$, so $r \\ge 2$, with equality only if $P_1 = P_2$. The parallel architecture always leads to greater or equal transport.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given $P_1 = 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and $P_2 = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$. We can write $P_1 = 10 P_2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the ratio $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{(10 P_2 + P_2)^2}{2 (10 P_2) P_2} = \\frac{(11 P_2)^2}{20 P_2^2} = \\frac{121 P_2^2}{20 P_2^2} = \\frac{121}{20}$$\n$$r = 6.05$$\nThe value is already at three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.05}$$", "id": "2568733"}]}
