It is a well-posed problem in linear control theory, grounded in established principles and free from scientific or logical flaws. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three derivations concerning a unity negative feedback control system with a given plant and controller. The plant is a first-order lag with transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{1}{\\tau s + 1}$, where $\\tau  0$. The controller is a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with transfer function $C(s) = K_P + \\frac{K_I}{s} + K_D s$.\n\nFirst, we address Task $1$: the derivation of the closed-loop characteristic polynomial. For a unity negative feedback system, the closed-loop transfer function $T(s)$ is given by $T(s) = \\frac{C(s)G(s)}{1 + C(s)G(s)}$. The characteristic equation of the closed-loop system is defined by setting the denominator of $T(s)$ to zero:\n$$1 + C(s)G(s) = 0$$\nWe must first compute the open-loop transfer function $L(s) = C(s)G(s)$. We express the controller transfer function over a common denominator:\n$$C(s) = K_P + \\frac{K_I}{s} + K_D s = \\frac{K_P s + K_I + K_D s^2}{s} = \\frac{K_D s^2 + K_P s + K_I}{s}$$\nNow, we multiply by the plant transfer function:\n$$L(s) = C(s)G(s) = \\left( \\frac{K_D s^2 + K_P s + K_I}{s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau s + 1} \\right) = \\frac{K_D s^2 + K_P s + K_I}{s(\\tau s + 1)}$$\nSubstituting this into the characteristic equation gives:\n$$1 + \\frac{K_D s^2 + K_P s + K_I}{s(\\tau s + 1)} = 0$$\nTo find the characteristic polynomial, we clear the denominator by multiplying both sides by $s(\\tau s + 1)$:\n$$s(\\tau s + 1) + (K_D s^2 + K_P s + K_I) = 0$$\nExpanding and collecting terms according to powers of $s$:\n$$\\tau s^2 + s + K_D s^2 + K_P s + K_I = 0$$\n$$(\\tau + K_D) s^2 + (1 + K_P) s + K_I = 0$$\nThe closed-loop characteristic polynomial, $P(s)$, is therefore:\n$$P(s) = (\\tau + K_D) s^2 + (1 + K_P) s + K_I$$\nThis completes the first task. It is a second-order polynomial.\n\nNext, for Task $2$, we apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion (RHC) to determine the conditions for asymptotic stability. For a second-order polynomial of the form $a_2 s^2 + a_1 s + a_0 = 0$, the RHC simplifies to the condition that all coefficients $a_2$, $a_1$, and $a_0$ must be non-zero and have the same sign. For a physically meaningful system that is not inherently unstable, we require all coefficients to be strictly positive.\nThe coefficients of our characteristic polynomial are:\n$$a_2 = \\tau + K_D$$\n$$a_1 = 1 + K_P$$\n$$a_0 = K_I$$\nThus, the three conditions for stability are:\n$1$. $a_2  0 \\implies \\tau + K_D  0$. Since $\\tau  0$, this requires $K_D  -\\tau$.\n$2$. $a_1  0 \\implies 1 + K_P  0$, which requires $K_P  -1$.\n$3$. $a_0  0 \\implies K_I  0$.\nThese three inequalities on the controller parameters $K_P$, $K_I$, and $K_D$ represent the conditions for asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.\n\nFinally, for Task $3$, we derive an expression for the damping ratio $\\zeta$. This is achieved by comparing our characteristic polynomial to the standard normalized form of a second-order system characteristic polynomial, which is $s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2 = 0$, where $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio and $\\omega_n$ is the natural frequency.\nStarting with our characteristic equation:\n$$(\\tau + K_D) s^2 + (1 + K_P) s + K_I = 0$$\nWe normalize it by dividing by the leading coefficient, $(\\tau + K_D)$, assuming the stability condition $\\tau + K_D  0$ holds:\n$$s^2 + \\left( \\frac{1 + K_P}{\\tau + K_D} \\right) s + \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\tau + K_D} \\right) = 0$$\nBy comparing this with the standard form $s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2 = 0$, we can equate the coefficients:\n$$\\omega_n^2 = \\frac{K_I}{\\tau + K_D}$$\n$$2\\zeta\\omega_n = \\frac{1 + K_P}{\\tau + K_D}$$\nFrom the first equation, we solve for the natural frequency $\\omega_n$. Assuming stability, the right-hand side is positive, so we can take the positive square root:\n$$\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_I}{\\tau + K_D}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\omega_n$ into the second equation to solve for $\\zeta$:\n$$2\\zeta \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{K_I}{\\tau + K_D}} \\right) = \\frac{1 + K_P}{\\tau + K_D}$$\nIsolating $\\zeta$ yields:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1 + K_P}{\\tau + K_D} \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau + K_D}{K_I}} \\right)$$\nThis can be simplified by manipulating the terms involving square roots:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{1 + K_P}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\tau + K_D}}{(\\tau + K_D) \\sqrt{K_I}}$$\nSince $\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{x} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$ for $x  0$, we have:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{1 + K_P}{2 \\sqrt{K_I (\\tau + K_D)}}$$\nThis is the required single closed-form analytic expression for the damping ratio $\\zeta$ as a function of the system and controller parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1 + K_P}{2 \\sqrt{K_I (\\tau + K_D)}}}$$", "id": "2600401"}, {"introduction": "A key function of homeostasis is to maintain critical physiological variables at a constant setpoint despite persistent external or internal disturbances.
