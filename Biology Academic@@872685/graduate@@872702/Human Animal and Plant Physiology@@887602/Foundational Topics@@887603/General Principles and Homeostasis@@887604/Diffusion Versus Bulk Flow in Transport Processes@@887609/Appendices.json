We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe task is to non-dimensionalize the advection-diffusion equation. We are instructed to use $L$, $U$, and $C_0$ as the characteristic scales for length, velocity, and concentration, respectively. We define the following dimensionless variables, denoted with a prime ($'$):\n\n1. Dimensionless position, $x'$:\n$$x' = \\frac{x}{L}$$\n2. Dimensionless concentration, $C'$: The characteristic concentration is $C_0$, a difference relative to a reference $C_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. Thus, the dimensionless concentration is defined as:\n$$C' = \\frac{C - C_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{C_0}$$\n3. Dimensionless time, $t'$: We must construct a characteristic time scale, $\\tau_c$, from the given fundamental scales $L$ (length) and $U$ (velocity, length/time). The only combination of $L$ and $U$ that yields units of time is $\\tau_c = L/U$.

From the relation for mean squared displacement $\\langle x^2 \\rangle \\sim Dt$, we have $L^2 \\sim D\\tau_{diff}$, which gives $\\tau_{diff} = L^2/D$.\n\nThe Péclet number is the ratio of these two time scales:\n$$ Pe = \\frac{L^2/D}{L/U} = \\frac{\\tau_{diff}}{\\tau_{adv}} $$\n\nWe now justify the dominant transport mechanism in the specified limits from these first principles.\n\n1.  **Limit $Pe \\ll 1$ (e.g., slow flow, small scale, or high diffusivity):**\n    If $Pe \\ll 1$, then $\\tau_{diff} \\ll \\tau_{adv}$. This means that the time required for a substance to diffuse across the characteristic length $L$ is much shorter than the time it takes for the bulk flow to transport it over the same distance. Consequently, the substance spreads out due to molecular motion much faster than it is carried along by the flow. In this limit, **diffusion dominates** the transport process.\n\n2.  **Limit $Pe \\gg 1$ (e.g., fast flow, large scale, or low diffusivity):**\n    If $Pe \\gg 1$, then $\\tau_{diff} \\gg \\tau_{adv}$. This indicates that the time required for bulk flow to transport a substance over the length $L$ is much shorter than the characteristic diffusion time over that same length. The substance is swept downstream by advection long before it can significantly spread out due to diffusion. In this limit, **advection (bulk flow) dominates** the transport process.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the closed-form analytic expression for the identified dimensionless group.

The problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the fundamental principle of mass conservation and well-established constitutive laws for flux (Fick's first law for diffusion and the definition of advective flux). The setup is a standard model in transport phenomena and fluid dynamics. The problem is well-posed: it specifies a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients and provides two boundary conditions (a Dirichlet problem), which is sufficient to guarantee a unique and stable solution. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions, such as one-dimensionality and constant coefficients, are standard idealizations used to make the problem analytically tractable. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of mass conservation for the solute. Consider a differential control volume of length $\\Delta x$ and constant cross-sectional area $A$, located between the axial positions $x$ and $x + \\Delta x$. At steady state, the rate of solute mass entering the control volume must equal the rate of solute mass exiting it. The total mass flux of the solute, $J(x)$, is the sum of the advective flux, $J_{adv}$, and the diffusive flux, $J_{diff}$.\n\nThe advective flux is given by $J_{adv}(x) = v C(x)$.\nThe diffusive flux is given by Fick's first law: $J_{diff}(x) = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$.\n\nThe total flux per unit area along the $x$-axis is therefore:\n$$J(x) = J_{adv}(x) + J_{diff}(x) = v C(x) - D \\frac{dC(x)}{dx}$$\n\nThe mass balance equation for the control volume at steady state is:\n$$A J(x) - A J(x + \\Delta x) = 0$$\nDividing by the volume of the element, $A \\Delta x$, we obtain:\n$$-\\frac{J(x + \\Delta x) - J(x)}{\\Delta x} = 0$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$ gives the differential form of the conservation equation:\n$$-\\frac{dJ(x)}{dx} = 0$$\nThis implies that the total flux $J(x)$ is constant along the conduit. Substituting the expression for $J(x)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( v C(x) - D \\frac{dC(x)}{dx} \\right) = 0$$\nSince $v$ and $D$ are constants, we can perform the differentiation to obtain the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$v \\frac{dC}{dx} - D \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} = 0$$\nIt is conventional to write the highest order derivative with a positive coefficient:\n$$D \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - v \\frac{dC}{dx} = 0$$\nThis is the required ODE for the concentration profile $C(x)$ on the domain $x \\in (0,L)$.

A more rigorous approach is to derive a symbolic expression for $R$ to minimize numerical error from intermediate calculations.\n$$R = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{diff}}}{t_{\\mathrm{drift}}} = \\frac{L^2/(6D)}{L/v} = \\frac{Lv}{6D}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D$ gives:\n$$R = \\frac{Lv}{6 \\left( \\frac{k_{B}T}{6\\pi\\eta a} \\right)} = \\frac{Lv\\pi\\eta a}{k_{B}T}$$\nNow, substituting the given values in SI units:\n$$R = \\frac{(10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m})(10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})\\pi(3 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\,s})(3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})(310\\ \\mathrmK)}$$\n$$R = \\frac{9\\pi \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{4.27999 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J}} \\approx 0.066061$$\nRounding this dimensionless result to $3$ significant figures as specified in the problem statement gives $0.0661$. This value, being significantly less than $1$, indicates that for the given length scale, diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism compared to cytoplasmic streaming.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0661}$$", "id": "2561641"}]}
