Seeds from two species were subjected to multiple dormancy-breaking treatments and germinated under specified temperature and light regimes.

It is scientifically grounded in the fields of plant physiology and statistical inference, is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All necessary data and model parameters for a complete solution are provided. We may therefore proceed.\n\nThe task requires the derivation of a general likelihood expression, the classification of two species based on provided data and models, and a specific calculation of evidence.\n\nFirst, let us address the derivation requested in the first task.\nThe fundamental premise is that each seed germination event is an independent Bernoulli trial. For a given condition $i$, with $n_i$ seeds sown and $k_i$ observed to germinate, the probability of this outcome is described by the binomial probability mass function. This represents the likelihood of the data $(n_i, k_i)$ given a germination probability $p_i$.\nThe likelihood for a single condition $i$ is:\n$$L_i(p_i \\mid k_i, n_i) = \\binom{n_i}{k_i} p_i^{k_i} (1 - p_i)^{n_i - k_i}$$\nwhere $\\binom{n_i}{k_i} = \\frac{n_i!}{k_i!(n_i-k_i)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n\nThe problem states that germination experiments across different conditions are independent. Therefore, the total likelihood for a set of $m$ experimental conditions is the product of the individual likelihoods:\n$$L_{\\text{total}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} L_i = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\binom{n_i}{k_i} p_i^{k_i} (1 - p_i)^{n_i - k_i}$$\nThis is the likelihood of the entire dataset under a model that specifies the set of probabilities $\\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_m\\}$.\n\nWe are asked to compare two alternative models, $\\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\\mathcal{M}_2$, which are defined by two different sets of germination probabilities, $\\{p_{1,i}\\}_{i=1}^m$ and $\\{p_{2,i}\\}_{i=1}^m$, respectively. The likelihood ratio, $LR$, is the ratio of the likelihoods of the data under these two models.\n$$LR = \\frac{L(\\text{data} \\mid \\mathcal{M}_1)}{L(\\text{data} \\mid \\mathcal{M}_2)} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\binom{n_i}{k_i} p_{1,i}^{k_i} (1 - p_{1,i})^{n_i - k_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\binom{n_i}{k_i} p_{2,i}^{k_i} (1 - p_{2,i})^{n_i - k_i}}$$\nThe binomial coefficient terms, $\\binom{n_i}{k_i}$, depend only on the observed data, not the model parameters, and thus cancel from the ratio:\n$$LR = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{p_{1,i}^{k_i} (1 - p_{1,i})^{n_i - k_i}}{p_{2,i}^{k_i} (1 - p_{2,i})^{n_i - k_i}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\frac{p_{1,i}}{p_{2,i}} \\right)^{k_i} \\left( \\frac{1 - p_{1,i}}{1 - p_{2,i}} \\right)^{n_i - k_i}$$\nTo derive the closed-form expression for the logarithm of the likelihood ratio, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of this expression. The logarithm of a product is the sum of logarithms, and the logarithm of a power is the exponent times the logarithm of the base.\n$$\\log_{10}(LR) = \\log_{10} \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\frac{p_{1,i}}{p_{2,i}} \\right)^{k_i} \\left( \\frac{1 - p_{1,i}}{1 - p_{2,i}} \\right)^{n_i - k_i} \\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}(LR) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\log_{10} \\left( \\left( \\frac{p_{1,i}}{p_{2,i}} \\right)^{k_i} \\left( \\frac{1 - p_{1,i}}{1 - p_{2,i}} \\right)^{n_i - k_i} \\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}(LR) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[ k_i \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p_{1,i}}{p_{2,i}}\\right) + (n_i - k_i) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1 - p_{1,i}}{1 - p_{2,i}}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression. It is equivalent to the difference between the log-likelihoods of the two models, $\\log_{10}(L_1) - \\log_{10}(L_2)$.\n\nNext, we address the second task: classifying the dormancy type for Species A and Species B. We will compute the log-likelihood for each dormancy model (PY, PD, ND) for each species. For comparison, it is sufficient to compute the portion of the log-likelihood that depends on the model parameters, which we denote $LL'_{10}$. For a given model $\\mathcal{M}$ with probabilities $\\{p_i\\}$, this is:\n$$LL'_{10}(\\mathcal{M}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[ k_i \\log_{10}(p_i) + (n_i - k_i) \\log_{10}(1 - p_i) \\right]$$\nThe model with the highest (least negative) $LL'_{10}$ is the most likely.\n\nFor Species A, we have $n=20$ for all $m=6$ conditions.

The expression for $a_{\\mathrm{LOF}}$ is therefore:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{LOF}}([A]) = \\frac{k_p([A] + K_d)}{k_p([A] + K_d) + r k_d E_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_d}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of $a_{\\mathrm{WT}}([A]_{\\mathrm{WT}})$ using $[A]_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 3.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and the provided parameters:\n$K_d = 2.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$k_d = 5.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_p = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe numerator term is $k_p([A]_{\\mathrm{WT}} + K_d) = 0.50 \\times (3.0 + 2.0) = 0.50 \\times 5.0 = 2.5$.\nThe second term in the denominator is $k_d E_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_d = 5.0 \\times 0.20 \\times 2.0 = 2.0$.\nSo, for the wild type:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{WT}}(3.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) = \\frac{2.5}{2.5 + 2.0} = \\frac{2.5}{4.5} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nNow, we must find $[A]_{\\mathrm{new}}$ such that $a_{\\mathrm{LOF}}([A]_{\\mathrm{new}}) = \\frac{5}{9}$.\nLet $[A]_{\\mathrm{new}}$ be denoted by $A_{\\mathrm{new}}$. The equation is:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{LOF}}(A_{\\mathrm{new}}) = \\frac{k_p(A_{\\mathrm{new}} + K_d)}{k_p(A_{\\mathrm{new}} + K_d) + r k_d E_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_d} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nWe use the numerical values for the parameters in the LOF context.\nThe numerator is $0.50(A_{\\mathrm{new}} + 2.0)$.\nThe second term in the denominator is $r k_d E_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_d = 0.70 \\times (5.0 \\times 0.20 \\times 2.0) = 0.70 \\times 2.0 = 1.4$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{0.50(A_{\\mathrm{new}} + 2.0)}{0.50(A_{\\mathrm{new}} + 2.0) + 1.4} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nWe now solve for $A_{\\mathrm{new}}$. Let $X = 0.50(A_{\\mathrm{new}} + 2.0)$. The equation is:\n$$\\frac{X}{X + 1.4} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\n$$9X = 5(X + 1.4)$$\n$$9X = 5X + 7.0$$\n$$4X = 7.0$$\n$$X = \\frac{7.0}{4.0} = 1.75$$\nNow we substitute back $X = 0.50(A_{\\mathrm{new}} + 2.0)$:\n$$0.50(A_{\\mathrm{new}} + 2.0) = 1.75$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{new}} + 2.0 = \\frac{1.75}{0.50} = 3.5$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{new}} = 3.5 - 2.0 = 1.5$$\nThe required ABA concentration for the mutant is $[A]_{\\mathrm{new}} = 1.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the characteristic time for diffusion, starting from Fick's second law, which describes the evolution of a concentration field $C$ over time $t$. In its general form, the law is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 C\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. To determine the scaling relationship through dimensional analysis, we examine the dimensions of each term. Let $[X]$ denote the dimension of a physical quantity $X$. The fundamental dimensions are mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T_{dim}$). Concentration $C$ has dimensions of amount per volume, which we can denote as $[C]$. The diffusion coefficient $D$ has dimensions of length squared per time, or $[D] = \\frac{L^2}{T_{dim}}$. The spatial derivatives in the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ contribute dimensions of inverse length squared, or $[\\nabla^2] = \\frac{1}{L^2}$.\n\nThe dimensional form of Fick's second law is:\n$$\n\\frac{[C]}{[t]} \\sim [D] [\\nabla^2] [C]\n$$\nSubstituting the dimensions for the operators yields:\n$$\n\\frac{[C]}{[t]} \\sim \\frac{L^2}{T_{dim}} \\frac{1}{L^2} [C]\n$$\nHere, $[t]$ represents the characteristic time scale for the process, which we can call $\\tau$. The characteristic length scale over which the concentration changes significantly is denoted by $[L]$. The equation for the scaling of these characteristic quantities is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{[C]}{\\tau} \\sim \\frac{D}{L^2} [C]\n$$\nThe concentration dimension $[C]$ cancels from both sides, as it must. Solving for the characteristic time $\\tau$ gives the scaling relationship:\n$$\n\\tau \\sim \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis result is fundamental: the characteristic time for diffusion over a distance $L$ is proportional to the square of that distance and inversely proportional to the diffusivity.\n\nWe now apply this scaling law to the specific problem of the seeds. The characteristic length scale $L$ is given as the seed radius.\nFor water diffusion, the characteristic time is $t_{w}$. Using the derived scaling law, with characteristic length $R$ and diffusivity $D_{w}$:\n$$\nt_{w} = k \\frac{R^2}{D_{w}}\n$$\nFor oxygen diffusion, the characteristic time is $t_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}$. Using characteristic length $R$ and diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}} = k \\frac{R^2}{D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the proportionality constant $k$ is the same for both processes and both seeds, as it depends on geometry and boundary condition definitions which are assumed to be equivalent.\n\nThe total diffusion-limited lag time $T$ is defined as the sum of these two characteristic times:\n$$\nT = t_{w} + t_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}} = k \\frac{R^2}{D_{w}} + k \\frac{R^2}{D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common terms to express $T$ as a function of the radius $R$:\n$$\nT(R) = k R^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{D_{w}} + \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}} \\right)\n$$\nThis equation shows that the total lag time $T$ is proportional to the square of the seed radius.\n\nWe can now compute the total lag times for Seed A (radius $R_A = R$) and Seed B (radius $R_B = 2R$).\nFor Seed A:\n$$\nT_{\\text{Seed A}} = T(R) = k R^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{D_{w}} + \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}} \\right)\n$$\nFor Seed B:\n$$\nT_{\\text{Seed B}} = T(2R) = k (2R)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{D_{w}} + \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}} \\right) = k (4R^2) \\left( \\frac{1}{D_{w}} + \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}} \\right)\n$$\nIt is clear that $T_{\\text{Seed B}} = 4 \\times T_{\\text{Seed A}}$.\n\nThe final task is to compute the fold-change, $F$:\n$$\nF \\equiv \\frac{T_{\\text{Seed B}}}{T_{\\text{Seed A}}} = \\frac{4 k R^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{D_{w}} + \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}} \\right)}{k R^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{D_{w}} + \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}} \\right)}\n$$\nAll terms cancel except for the numerical factor:\n$$\nF = 4\n$$\nAs an interpretive aside, the scaling $t_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}} \\propto R^2$ indicates that the time required to supply oxygen to the seed's interior increases quadratically with its radius. By doubling the radius, the oxygen diffusion time increases by a factor of $4$. A longer delay in oxygen availability, after metabolism has been activated by water imbibition, means the larger seed will spend more time in a state of potential hypoxia. This extended period of low oxygen can impede the efficient production of ATP required for growth and establishment. Therefore, the larger seed is predicted to be substantially more sensitive to hypoxic conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2606927"}]}
