These models are cornerstones of biochemistry and pharmacology. The biological context (ABA signaling) is realistic and relevant. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and relationships provided to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nFirst, we address the monomeric receptor. The fractional occupancy, $f_{\\mathrm{mono}}$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound to the ligand, which is abscisic acid ($A$).\n$$f_{\\mathrm{mono}} = \\frac{[RA]}{R_T}$$\nThe total receptor concentration is given by the conservation relation $R_{T} = [R] + [RA]$. Substituting this into the definition of $f_{\\mathrm{mono}}$ gives:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{mono}} = \\frac{[RA]}{[R] + [RA]}$$\nFrom the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, as $[R] = \\frac{K_{d}[RA]}{[A]}$. We substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $f_{\\mathrm{mono}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{mono}} = \\frac{[RA]}{\\frac{K_{d}[RA]}{[A]} + [RA]}$$\nThe term $[RA]$ is present in both terms of the denominator and in the numerator. It can be factored out and cancelled, provided $[RA] \\neq 0$, which is true for any non-zero concentration of ligand $[A]$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{mono}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[A]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[A]$ yields the final expression for the fractional occupancy of the monomeric receptor:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{mono}} = \\frac{[A]}{K_{d} + [A]}$$\n\nSecond, we address the cooperative dimeric receptor. The problem specifies the use of the Hill–Langmuir model. The fractional occupancy for this model is given by the general formula:\n$$f = \\frac{[A]^n}{K^n + [A]^n}$$\nwhere $n$ is the Hill coefficient and $K$ is the microscopic dissociation constant, which is equivalent to the ligand concentration that produces half-maximal occupancy, here denoted $K_{0.5}$. The problem states that $n=2$. Therefore, the fractional occupancy for the dimeric receptor is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{dimer}} = \\frac{[A]^2}{K_{0.5}^2 + [A]^2}$$\n\nThird, we find the abscisic acid concentration $[A]^{\\ast}$ at which the fractional occupancies of the two receptor types are equal. We set $f_{\\mathrm{mono}} = f_{\\mathrm{dimer}}$:\n$$\\frac{[A]}{K_{d} + [A]} = \\frac{[A]^2}{K_{0.5}^2 + [A]^2}$$\nThis equation has a trivial solution $[A] = 0$, where both occupancies are zero. To find the non-trivial solution, we assume $[A] \\neq 0$ and divide both sides by $[A]$:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_{d} + [A]} = \\frac{[A]}{K_{0.5}^2 + [A]^2}$$\nWe proceed by cross-multiplication:\n$$1 \\cdot (K_{0.5}^2 + [A]^2) = [A] \\cdot (K_{d} + [A])$$\n$$K_{0.5}^2 + [A]^2 = K_{d}[A] + [A]^2$$\nThe $[A]^2$ terms on both sides of the equation cancel:\n$$K_{0.5}^2 = K_{d}[A]$$\nSolving for $[A]$ gives the desired concentration, $[A]^{\\ast}$:\n$$[A]^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_{0.5}^2}{K_{d}}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the provided numerical values, $K_{d} = 0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_{0.5} = 1.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, into the derived expression for $[A]^{\\ast}$:\n$$[A]^{\\ast} = \\frac{(1.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{2}}{0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1.44\\,(\\mu\\mathrm{M})^2}{0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\n$$[A]^{\\ast} = 4.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The biosynthetic influx $v_{b}$ remains constant. The new governing equation for the system for all time $t>0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = v_{b} - (2k_{c})A\n$$\nThe problem asks for the new steady-state concentration, which we will denote as $A_{ss, new}$. After sufficient time has passed, the system will relax to this new equilibrium. At this new steady state, the concentration is again constant, and its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into the new governing equation gives:\n$$\n0 = v_{b} - 2k_{c}A_{ss, new}\n$$\nSolving for the new steady-state concentration, $A_{ss, new}$, we find:\n$$\nA_{ss, new} = \\frac{v_{b}}{2k_{c}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed solely in terms of the initial steady-state concentration, $A_0$. To achieve this, we use the relationship derived from the initial steady state: $v_{b} = k_{c}A_{0}$. We substitute this expression for $v_{b}$ into our equation for $A_{ss, new}$:\n$$\nA_{ss, new} = \\frac{(k_{c}A_{0})}{2k_{c}}\n$$\nAssuming that catabolism occurs, the rate coefficient $k_{c}$ must be non-zero ($k_{c} > 0$). Therefore, we can safely cancel $k_{c}$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\nA_{ss, new} = \\frac{A_{0}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the new steady-state ABA concentration in terms of the initial concentration.

This conceptual exercise asks you to predict the physiological consequences of systematically removing these negative regulators, providing insight into how redundancy confers robustness and how its disruption leads to signal hypersensitivity [@problem_id:2546593].", "problem": "Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in land plants integrates environmental water deficit into physiological outputs such as stomatal closure and stress-responsive gene expression. Core components include the PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE/PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE LIKE/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (PYR/PYL/RCAR) family of receptors, clade A Protein Phosphatase 2C (PP2C) enzymes that act as negative regulators, and SNF1-related protein kinases 2 (SnRK2) that phosphorylate ion channels and transcription factors. In the absence of ABA, PP2C enzymes dephosphorylate and inhibit SnRK2 kinases; in the presence of ABA, PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors bind ABA and allosterically inhibit PP2C enzymes, which permits SnRK2 activation.\n\nConsider a set of three partially redundant clade A PP2C enzymes expressed in guard cells and seedlings. Assume a minimal steady-state balance model in which the active SnRK2 signal $S$ arises from a competition between an effective kinase input rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and a phosphatase removal flux proportional to the pool of active PP2C, $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)$, which decreases monotonically with ABA concentration $A$ due to receptor-mediated inhibition.

You also assess, under non-stress conditions, growth rate and germination fraction on media containing a low ABA dose that minimally affects wild type.\n\nWhich option best justifies how redundancy among PP2C enzymes confers robustness to ABA signaling and predicts the qualitative phenotypic series across single, double, and triple PP2C mutants?\n\nA. Because the PP2C pool is the sum of partially redundant enzymes, removal of one PP2C reduces $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)$ modestly, so $S(A)$ and ABA outputs shift slightly leftward in the ABA dose–response; removal of two PP2Cs reduces $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)$ further, producing a larger left shift; removal of three PP2Cs yields near-constitutive SnRK2 activation even at $A_{\\mathrm{basal}}$. Therefore, under drought, single mutants are mildly ABA-hypersensitive with moderately reduced $g_{s}$, increased RD29B, and somewhat higher $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$; double mutants are strongly hypersensitive with very low $g_{s}$ and high $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$ but incur growth penalties; triple mutants exhibit near-constitutive closure and transcription even without drought, showing strong drought tolerance but severe growth retardation and markedly reduced germination on low ABA.\n\nB. Redundancy makes the network fragile to single hits: removal of one PP2C ablates most dephosphorylation, drastically reducing $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)$ and causing severe ABA hyposensitivity and drought mortality, but removal of two or three PP2Cs triggers compensatory feedback that restores wild-type responses in drought and normal growth and germination.\n\nC. PP2C enzymes are required for propagating the ABA signal from receptors to kinases; hence, loss of PP2Cs decreases $S(A)$. Single mutants show no discernible phenotype, while double and triple mutants are ABA-insensitive with elevated $g_{s}$, low RD29B, low $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$ in drought, and faster germination on low ABA.\n\nD. Single and double PP2C mutants are ABA-hypersensitive under drought due to reduced $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)$, but the triple mutant becomes ABA-insensitive because PP2Cs are necessary to inhibit PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors; thus, triple mutants have open stomata, low RD29B, and poor drought survival, with normal growth and germination on low ABA.", "solution": "The supplied problem statement will first be subjected to a rigorous validation procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Core Signaling Pathway**: Abscisic acid ($\\text{ABA}$) signaling involves $\\text{PYR/PYL/RCAR}$ receptors, clade A Protein Phosphatase $2$C ($\\text{PP2C}$) enzymes (negative regulators), and $\\text{SNF1}$-related protein kinases $2$ ($\\text{SnRK2}$) (positive effectors).\n- **Mechanism of Action**: In the absence of $\\text{ABA}$, $\\text{PP2C}$ enzymes dephosphorylate and inactivate $\\text{SnRK2}$ kinases.

No flaws are detected. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the consequences of removing negative regulators from a signaling pathway. The signal, $S(A)$, is given by:\n$$\nS(A) \\propto \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)}\n$$\nThe term $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)$ represents the total activity of the $\\text{PP2C}$ negative regulators. According to the problem, this pool is additive across the $3$ gene products. Let the activity contribution of each $\\text{PP2C}$ be $p_i(A)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\n1.  **Wild Type (WT)**: All $3$ genes are present.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}(A) = p_1(A) + p_2(A) + p_3(A)$.\n\n2.  **Single Mutant**: One gene is knocked out. Let us say gene $1$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\mathrm{single}}(A) = p_2(A) + p_3(A)$.\n\n3.  **Double Mutant**: Two genes are knocked out. Let us say genes $1$ and $2$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\mathrm{double}}(A) = p_3(A)$.\n\n4.  **Triple Mutant**: All three genes are knocked out.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\mathrm{triple}}(A) = 0$.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that for any given $\\text{ABA}$ concentration $A$, the total active $\\text{PP2C}$ pool decreases with each successive knockout:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}(A) > P_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\mathrm{single}}(A) > P_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\mathrm{double}}(A) > P_{\\mathrm{act}}^{\\mathrm{triple}}(A) = 0\n$$\nSince $S(A)$ is inversely dependent on $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)$, the relationship for the $\\text{SnRK2}$ signal will be inverted:\n$$\nS^{\\mathrm{WT}}(A) < S^{\\mathrm{single}}(A) < S^{\\mathrm{double}}(A) < S^{\\mathrm{triple}}(A)\n$$\nThis means that for any given level of $\\text{ABA}$, the mutant plants will have a stronger signaling output than the wild type, and the strength of this output increases with the number of knocked-out $\\text{PP2C}$ genes. This phenomenon is termed **hypersensitivity**. To reach the activation threshold $S^{\\star}$, a hypersensitive mutant requires a lower concentration of $\\text{ABA}$ than the wild type. In a dose-response plot of $S$ versus $A$, the curve for the mutants will be shifted to the left compared to the wild type, with the magnitude of the shift increasing from single to double to triple mutants.\n\nFor the **triple mutant**, $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A) = 0$. The model simplifies to:\n$$\nS^{\\mathrm{triple}}(A) \\propto \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\cdot 0} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} = 1\n$$\nThis implies that the signal $S$ is maximal and independent of the $\\text{ABA}$ concentration $A$. The signaling pathway is **constitutively active**, even at the low basal $\\text{ABA}$ level, $A_{\\mathrm{basal}}$.\n\nNow, we translate these signaling characteristics into physiological and developmental phenotypes:\n- **High $\\text{ABA}$ signal ($S > S^{\\star}$)**: Promotes stress responses, including stomatal closure (lower $g_s$), expression of stress genes like $\\text{RD29B}$ (higher expression), and consequently, increased drought survival ($P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$). However, $\\text{ABA}$ is also a potent inhibitor of growth and seed germination.\n- **Redundancy**: The presence of $3$ \"partially redundant\" enzymes means that the loss of one has a non-lethal, graded effect. The system is robust to single-gene loss, showing only a mild change in phenotype. The system's response degrades progressively as more components are removed.\n\n**Predicted Phenotypic Series**:\n- **Single mutant**: Mildly hypersensitive. Under drought ($A_{\\mathrm{drought}}$), it will exhibit a stronger response than WT: moderately lower $g_s$, higher $\\text{RD29B}$ expression, and improved $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$. Growth penalties under normal conditions would be minimal.\n- **Double mutant**: Strongly hypersensitive. Under drought, it will show a very strong response: very low $g_s$, high $\\text{RD29B}$, and high $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$. The trade-off will be a more significant growth penalty even under non-stress conditions.\n- **Triple mutant**: Constitutively active signaling. The stress response is \"on\" even without a stress signal ($A_{\\mathrm{basal}}$). This leads to phenotypes like permanently reduced stomatal opening, high basal $\\text{RD29B}$ expression. While this confers extreme drought tolerance, it comes at a severe cost: strong growth retardation and inhibition of germination, especially on media containing a low dose of $\\text{ABA}$ that would not affect the wild type.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option states that removing $\\text{PP2C}$ enzymes progressively reduces $P_{\\mathrm{act}}(A)$, causing leftward shifts in the dose-response curve, culminating in near-constitutive activation for the triple mutant. It then correctly predicts the phenotypic consequences: graded hypersensitivity for single and double mutants (moderately reduced $g_s$ and increased $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$ for single; very low $g_s$, high $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$ but growth penalties for double) and severe developmental defects for the triple mutant (strong drought tolerance but severe growth retardation and poor germination). This description perfectly matches the derivation from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This option claims that redundancy makes the network fragile, which is a contradiction in terms. Robustness is the hallmark of redundant systems. It incorrectly predicts that a single knockout ablates most activity and causes ABA *hyposensitivity* (the opposite of what the model shows) and drought mortality. The suggestion of a 'compensatory feedback' restoring WT phenotype in double/triple mutants is an ad-hoc invention not supported by the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This option fundamentally misinterprets the role of $\\text{PP2C}$ enzymes, stating they are required to *propagate* the signal. They are negative regulators; their removal *enhances* the signal. Consequently, it incorrectly predicts that loss of $\\text{PP2Cs}$ *decreases* $S(A)$ and leads to ABA *insensitivity* (elevated $g_s$, low $\\text{RD29B}$, low $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}$). This is the direct opposite of the correct biological function and the model's prediction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This option correctly identifies single and double mutants as ABA-hypersensitive. However, it then makes an unsupported and biologically incorrect assertion that the triple mutant becomes ABA-insensitive because \"$\\text{PP2Cs}$ are necessary to inhibit $\\text{PYR/PYL/RCAR}$ receptors\". This inverts the known mechanism of action; receptors inhibit $\\text{PP2Cs}$, not the other way around. This false premise leads to incorrect predictions for the triple mutant phenotype (open stomata, poor survival).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2546593"}]}
