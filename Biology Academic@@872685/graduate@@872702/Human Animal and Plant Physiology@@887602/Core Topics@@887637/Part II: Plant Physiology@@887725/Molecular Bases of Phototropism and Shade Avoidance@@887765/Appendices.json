Let primed variables denote the mutant.\n\n1.  **Steady-State Curvature ($\\kappa_{ss}$):**\n    - WT: $\\kappa_{ss, WT} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\left(\\frac{k_a I_0}{k_a I_0 + k_2}\\right)$\n    - Mutant: $\\kappa_{ss, Mut} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\left(\\frac{k_a I_0}{k_a I_0 + k_2/2}\\right)$\n    Since $k_2 > 0$, the denominator $(k_a I_0 + k_2/2)$ is smaller than $(k_a I_0 + k_2)$. Therefore, $\\kappa_{ss, Mut} > \\kappa_{ss, WT}$. The mutant achieves a **larger** steady-state curvature.\n\n2.  **Onset Kinetics (Light On):**\n    The onset of the signaling asymmetry $\\Delta\\rho(t)$ is governed by the rate constant $k_{onset} = k_a I_0 + k_2$.\n    - WT: $k_{onset, WT} = k_a I_0 + k_2$\n    - Mutant: $k_{onset, Mut} = k_a I_0 + k_2/2$\n    Since $k_{onset, Mut} < k_{onset, WT}$, the signaling asymmetry $\\Delta\\rho(t)$ rises **more slowly** in the mutant. The curvature $\\kappa(t)$ is the response of a first-order system (with rate $\\beta$) to this input $\\alpha\\Delta\\rho(t)$. Since the input signal rises more slowly, the output response $\\kappa(t)$ will also rise **more slowly**. The time to reach any given fraction of the final state (e.g., the half-time, $t_{1/2}$) will be **increased** in the mutant.\n\n3.  **Offset Kinetics (Light Off):**\n    Assume the light is turned off after the system reaches steady state. For $t > t_{off}$, we have $I=0$. The equation for $\\rho_L(t)$ becomes $d\\rho_L/dt = -k_2\\rho_L$. The occupancy decays exponentially with rate constant $k_2$.\n    - WT: The decay rate is $k_2$.\n    - Mutant: The decay rate is $k'_2 = k_2/2$.\n    Since the mutant's decay rate is smaller, the signaling asymmetry $\\Delta\\rho(t)$ persists for longer. Consequently, the curvature $\\kappa(t)$ will relax back to zero **more slowly** in the mutant.\n\n4.  **Initial Rate of Change of Curvature:**\n    We evaluate $d\\kappa/dt$ at $t = 0^+$.\n    $$\n    \\left. \\frac{d\\kappa}{dt} \\right|_{t=0^+} = \\alpha[\\rho_L(0^+) - \\rho_D(0^+)] - \\beta\\kappa(0^+)\n    $$\n    From the initial conditions, $\\rho_L(0) = 0$, $\\rho_D(0)=0$, and $\\kappa(0)=0$. By continuity, these values hold at $t=0^+$.\n    $$\n    \\left. \\frac{d\\kappa}{dt} \\right|_{t=0^+} = \\alpha[0 - 0] - \\beta(0) = 0\n    $$\n    The initial rate of change of curvature is exactly $0$ for both the WT and the mutant. It is therefore **unchanged**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Under a sustained unilateral blue-light step at intensity $I_0$, the mutant reaches a larger steady-state curvature magnitude and does so more slowly; after light is turned off, curvature relaxes more slowly back to baseline.**\n    - \"larger steady-state curvature\": Correct, as shown in (1).\n    - \"does so more slowly\": Correct, as shown in (2).\n    - \"curvature relaxes more slowly\": Correct, as shown in (3).\n    This statement is a complete and accurate summary of the mutant's phenotype according to the model.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Under the same stimulus, the mutant’s steady-state curvature magnitude is reduced and both onset and offset kinetics are faster.**\n    - \"magnitude is reduced\": Incorrect. It is increased.\n    - \"kinetics are faster\": Incorrect. Both onset and offset are slower.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The instantaneous initial rate of change of curvature at $t=0^+$ is unchanged by the mutation, but the time required to reach half of the steady-state curvature is increased.**\n    - \"instantaneous initial rate... is unchanged\": Correct, as shown in (4). It is $0$ for both.\n    - \"time required to reach half... is increased\": Correct, as shown in (2). The onset is slower.\n    This statement is also entirely consistent with the model's predictions.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **D. Because the dark side also contains phot$1$ with slowed recovery, the asymmetry cancels and no net curvature develops.**\n    - On the dark side, $I_D=0$, so the rate of activation is $k_a I_D (1-\\rho_D) = 0$. With the initial condition $\\rho_D(0)=0$, the occupancy $\\rho_D(t)$ remains $0$ at all times regardless of the value of $k_2$. No signaling occurs on the dark side, so no cancellation is possible. An asymmetry does develop.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. The mutant exhibits an earlier and larger transient peak in curvature before settling to a lower steady-state value than wild type.**\n    - The dynamics of $\\kappa(t)$ are governed by a sum of exponentials, resulting from the convolution of two first-order processes. The response is monotonically increasing to a steady state; there is no transient peak or overshoot in this model.\n    - Furthermore, the statement claims a *lower* steady-state value, which is contrary to our findings.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBoth options A and C are correct deductions from the provided model. Option A provides a qualitative summary of the entire process (onset, steady-state, offset), while option C focuses on specific quantitative features of the onset kinetics. Both are valid predictions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2584123"}]}
