## Introduction
Strigolactones (SLs) are a crucial class of [plant hormones](@entry_id:143955) that have emerged as master regulators of [plant development](@entry_id:154890) and key mediators of interactions within the soil ecosystem. Their profound influence on everything from a plant's shape to its symbiotic partnerships makes them a subject of intense scientific interest. However, understanding how these relatively simple molecules orchestrate such a diverse array of responses requires a deep dive into their underlying molecular machinery and ecological context. This article bridges that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of [strigolactone signaling](@entry_id:155611). In the following chapters, we will first dissect the core "Principles and Mechanisms," detailing the biosynthesis, perception, and [signal transduction cascade](@entry_id:156085) at the molecular level. Next, we will explore the broader "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," examining how this pathway governs shoot architecture, facilitates crucial symbioses, and is exploited by [parasitic plants](@entry_id:155226). Finally, a series of "Hands-On Practices" will offer conceptual exercises to solidify your understanding of the genetic and biochemical logic that underpins this fascinating signaling system.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Chemical Language of Strigolactones: Structure and Diversity

Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of terpenoid lactones derived from [carotenoids](@entry_id:146880), characterized by a common structural motif essential for their biological activity. A comprehensive understanding of SL signaling begins with an appreciation of their molecular architecture. The archetypal SL molecule consists of a tricyclic [lactone](@entry_id:192272), referred to as the ABC-ring system, which is connected via an enol-ether bridge to a fourth, five-membered butenolide ring known as the D-ring. It is the enol-ether-D-ring moiety that constitutes the primary pharmacophore responsible for [receptor binding](@entry_id:190271) and hydrolysis.

The structural diversity within the SL family is a key determinant of their functional specificity. A primary classification divides them into **canonical** and **non-canonical** [strigolactones](@entry_id:150774) [@problem_id:2610901]. **Canonical [strigolactones](@entry_id:150774)** possess the complete tetracyclic ABCD-ring scaffold. Prominent examples include strigol and orobanchol, along with their numerous naturally occurring derivatives like $5$-deoxystrigol. In contrast, **non-canonical [strigolactones](@entry_id:150774)** are compounds that retain the essential D-ring but lack the intact ABC tricyclic system. The most fundamental non-canonical SL is **carlactone**, which is the biosynthetic precursor to all other SLs and possesses only the C- and D-rings. Other examples include its metabolic derivatives, carlactonoic acid and methyl carlactonoate.

Stereochemistry plays a pivotal role in SL activity. Two stereocenters are particularly critical. The first is at the C-$2'$ carbon of the D-ring; for nearly all natural SLs, biological activity is contingent upon the ($R$)-configuration at this position. The enantiomeric ($S$)-form is typically inactive. The second key feature is the [stereochemistry](@entry_id:166094) at the B-C ring junction within the canonical SLs. This difference defines two major subfamilies: the **strigol-type**, which has a *trans* B-C ring fusion, and the **orobanchol-type**, which has a *cis* B-C fusion [@problem_id:2610901]. As we will see, these subtle variations in three-dimensional shape profoundly influence which receptor proteins a given SL can bind to and activate, forming the basis for specificity in physiological and ecological contexts.

### The Biosynthetic Pathway: From Carotenoids to Carlactone and Beyond

The production of [strigolactones](@entry_id:150774) in plants is a conserved pathway that begins with a common C$_{40}$ carotenoid precursor, all-trans-$\beta$-carotene, found in [plastids](@entry_id:268461). The core pathway consists of a sequence of enzymatic steps that can be conceptually divided into an "upper" pathway, which generates the universal intermediate carlactone, and a "lower" pathway, where carlactone is modified to produce the diverse array of canonical SLs [@problem_id:2610871].

The conversion of all-trans-$\beta$-carotene to carlactone is catalyzed by three key enzymes acting in sequence:

1.  **DWARF27 (D27)**: The pathway is initiated by the action of D27, a $\beta$-carotene isomerase. This enzyme specifically converts all-trans-$\beta$-carotene into its stereoisomer, $9$-cis-$\beta$-carotene. This isomerization is a prerequisite for the subsequent cleavage step.

2.  **CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 7 (CCD7)**: Also known as MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 3 (MAX3) in *Arabidopsis*, CCD7 acts upon $9$-cis-$\beta$-carotene. As a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, it uses molecular oxygen to cleave the C$_{9'}$-C$_{10'}$ double bond of its substrate. This reaction yields two products: a C$_{27}$ apocarotenoid called $9$-cis-$\beta$-apo-$10'$-carotenal and a C$_{13}$ byproduct, $\beta$-ionone.

3.  **CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 8 (CCD8)**: Known as MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 4 (MAX4) in *Arabidopsis*, CCD8 is another dioxygenase that catalyzes the final and most complex step in carlactone synthesis. It takes the $9$-cis-$\beta$-apo-$10'$-carotenal product from the CCD7 reaction and, through a series of oxidative cleavages and intramolecular rearrangements, cyclizes it to form the C$_{19}$ compound **carlactone**. This remarkable transformation establishes the fundamental CD-ring structure linked by the enol-ether bridge.

Following its synthesis, carlactone serves as the substrate for a variety of tailoring enzymes, primarily cytochrome P450 monooxygenases from the **MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 1 (MAX1)** family. These enzymes catalyze hydroxylations and other modifications on the A- and B-rings of the carlactone scaffold, generating the diverse suite of canonical [strigolactones](@entry_id:150774) such as orobanchol and 5-deoxystrigol that are found across different plant species [@problem_id:2610900].

### The Perception Mechanism: A Story of Binding, Hydrolysis, and Conformational Change

Strigolactone perception is a fascinating process that combines features of both classical [receptor-ligand binding](@entry_id:272572) and enzyme-substrate catalysis. The primary receptor for SLs in the context of [shoot branching](@entry_id:153563) is **DWARF14 (D14)**, a member of the $\alpha/\beta$-hydrolase superfamily of enzymes [@problem_id:2610879]. Its activation mechanism is a sophisticated, multi-step process that can be understood through the modern biophysical frameworks of [conformational selection](@entry_id:150437) and [induced fit](@entry_id:136602).

The activation of D14 does not follow a simple [lock-and-key model](@entry_id:271826). Instead, it begins with **[conformational selection](@entry_id:150437)**. In its unbound (apo) state, the D14 protein is not static but exists as an ensemble of conformations in [dynamic equilibrium](@entry_id:136767). A small fraction of the D14 population (approximately $10\%$) pre-exists in a "closed," active-like conformation, even in the absence of any SL ligand. When an SL molecule enters the receptor's hydrophobic binding pocket, it preferentially binds to and stabilizes this "closed" state, thereby shifting the conformational equilibrium towards this active-like form, in accordance with Le Châtelier's principle [@problem_id:2610843].

This initial binding, however, is not sufficient to generate a robust downstream signal. The true genius of the D14 receptor lies in its enzymatic activity. D14 contains a canonical **Ser-His-Asp [catalytic triad](@entry_id:177957)** typical of serine [hydrolases](@entry_id:178373). The SL molecule is not just a ligand but also a substrate. Following the initial non-covalent binding, the catalytic serine, activated by the His-Asp [charge-relay system](@entry_id:173344), performs a [nucleophilic attack](@entry_id:151896) on the D-ring of the SL. This initiates the hydrolysis of the SL molecule, cleaving the bond between the D-ring and the enol-ether bridge. Experiments using non-hydrolyzable SL analogs or catalytically dead D14 mutants (e.g., a Ser$\rightarrow$Ala substitution) demonstrate that while initial binding can still occur, it results in only a weak and transient signaling output [@problem_id:2610879] [@problem_id:2610843].

The crucial event for full receptor activation is the formation of a **[covalent intermediate](@entry_id:163264)**. After the D-ring is cleaved and released, the remaining ABC-ring portion of the SL molecule becomes covalently attached to the catalytic histidine residue within the D14 active site. This [covalent modification](@entry_id:171348) acts as a form of **covalent [induced fit](@entry_id:136602)**, irreversibly "locking" the D14 receptor in a hyper-stabilized, fully active conformation. This final, covalently modified state is the one that possesses a high-affinity interface for interacting with its downstream signaling partners [@problem_id:2610843].

### The Core Signaling Cascade: A Ubiquitin-Dependent Switch

Once D14 is fully activated, it initiates a [signaling cascade](@entry_id:175148) that culminates in changes to gene expression. This cascade is a canonical example of hormone-induced [protein degradation](@entry_id:187883), mediated by the [ubiquitin-proteasome system](@entry_id:153682). The central components are the SCF E3 [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) [ligase](@entry_id:139297) complex, the MAX2 F-box protein, and the SMXL family of [transcriptional repressors](@entry_id:177873).

The core of the degradation machinery is the **Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex**. This multi-protein complex consists of the scaffold protein Cullin 1 (CUL1), the RING-box protein RBX1, the adaptor protein SKP1, and a variable **F-box protein** that provides [substrate specificity](@entry_id:136373). In SL signaling, this F-box protein is **MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2)** [@problem_id:2610898]. The activity of this SCF complex is itself regulated, requiring the covalent attachment of a ubiquitin-like protein called NEDD8 to the cullin subunit—a process that can be experimentally blocked by inhibitors like MLN4924.

The targets of the $\text{SCF}^{\text{MAX2}}$ complex are a family of [transcriptional repressors](@entry_id:177873) known as **SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE (SMXL)** proteins, particularly SMXL6, SMXL7, and SMXL8 (also called D53 in rice). In the absence of SL, these SMXL proteins are stable and actively repress the transcription of downstream target genes, thereby inhibiting processes like bud outgrowth.

The link between the activated D14 receptor and the $\text{SCF}^{\text{MAX2}}$/SMXL system is a masterpiece of [molecular recognition](@entry_id:151970), best described by the **"[molecular glue](@entry_id:193296)" co-receptor model** [@problem_id:2610842]. The activated D14 (covalently modified with the SL remnant) and the MAX2 F-box protein form a complex. This complex does not directly bind the SMXL repressor through a pre-existing interface. Instead, the SL-modified D14 receptor creates a novel composite surface. This newly formed surface specifically recognizes and binds to a short, conserved linear motif on the SMXL protein known as a **[degron](@entry_id:181456)**. The strigolactone molecule thus acts as a [molecular glue](@entry_id:193296), bridging the interaction between D14 and its substrate, SMXL. This mechanism is strikingly analogous to the perception of the [plant hormone](@entry_id:155850) [auxin](@entry_id:144359), where auxin glues together its receptor TIR1 (an F-box protein) and its target Aux/IAA repressors.

By bringing the SMXL substrate into direct physical proximity with the $\text{SCF}^{\text{MAX2}}$ E3 ligase, the ternary D14-SMXL-MAX2 complex ensures the efficient transfer of [ubiquitin](@entry_id:174387) molecules onto the SMXL protein. The polyubiquitinated SMXL is then recognized and degraded by the **26S proteasome**, a large [protein complex](@entry_id:187933) whose function can be blocked by inhibitors like MG132 [@problem_id:2610898]. The destruction of the SMXL repressor lifts the repression on downstream genes, activating the physiological response.

The logic of this pathway has been elegantly dissected through genetic experiments [@problem_id:2610900]. Mutants lacking biosynthetic enzymes (e.g., *d27*, *max1*) have a hyper-branched phenotype due to a lack of SLs, but this can be rescued by applying synthetic SLs (like GR24) externally or by grafting a wild-type rootstock (which produces mobile SLs) onto the mutant shoot. In contrast, mutants in signaling components (e.g., *d14*, *max2*, or mutants with a stabilized, non-degradable SMXL protein) are also hyper-branched but cannot be rescued by external SLs or grafting, as their defect lies in the perception or transduction machinery itself.

### Transducing the Signal: Transcriptional Regulation of Bud Outgrowth

The degradation of SMXL repressors ultimately leads to a change in the plant's developmental program, such as the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth. This final step is mediated by downstream transcription factors. A primary effector at the end of the SL signaling cascade is **BRANCHED1 (BRC1)**, a member of the TCP family of transcription factors [@problem_id:2610903].

In the absence of SL, stable SMXL proteins repress the expression or activity of BRC1. When SL signaling is active, SMXLs are degraded, and BRC1 becomes active. BRC1 functions as a [master regulator](@entry_id:265566) that directly inhibits bud growth. This is evident from the fact that plants overexpressing BRC1 have very few branches, mimicking the effect of high SL levels, while *brc1* null mutants are hyper-branched and largely insensitive to SL treatment.

BRC1 executes its function by regulating a network of downstream genes. Experiments using [chromatin immunoprecipitation](@entry_id:166525) (ChIP-seq) have shown that BRC1 directly binds to the promoter regions of key genes required for cell division and growth. Using [protein synthesis inhibitors](@entry_id:177961) like cycloheximide (CHX), we can distinguish between its direct and indirect targets [@problem_id:2610903].

-   **Direct Targets**: Within minutes of SL application, BRC1 directly represses the transcription of genes essential for [meristem](@entry_id:176123) activation. This response is rapid and insensitive to CHX because it relies only on the pre-existing BRC1 protein. Key direct targets include genes encoding D-type cyclins (**CYCD**), which drive the cell cycle, and **[expansins](@entry_id:151279) (EXP)**, which are enzymes that loosen cell walls to permit growth. By shutting down these genes, BRC1 brings cell proliferation and expansion in the bud to a halt.

-   **Indirect Targets**: The SL signal also leads to later changes in gene expression that are dependent on new protein synthesis (i.e., they are blocked by CHX). For example, the transcription of genes encoding **PIN-FORMED (PIN)** auxin efflux carriers decreases several hours after SL treatment. This suggests that BRC1 directly regulates the expression of an intermediate transcription factor, and the protein product of that gene then goes on to repress *PIN* expression. This secondary wave of regulation helps to consolidate the growth-arresting signal.

### System-Level Control: Feedback and Feedforward Regulation

Like many biological pathways, strigolactone biosynthesis and signaling are subject to sophisticated system-level controls that ensure homeostasis and responsiveness to environmental cues. These can be understood using concepts from control theory, namely negative feedback and [feedforward regulation](@entry_id:152824) [@problem_id:2610856].

**Negative feedback** is a homeostatic mechanism where the output of a pathway inhibits its own production. In the SL system, the strigolactone hormone itself is the output. Experimental data show that when plants are treated with exogenous SLs (e.g., GR24), the transcript levels of the core biosynthetic genes—*D27*, *CCD7*, *CCD8*, and *MAX1*—are significantly reduced. This suppression requires a functional signaling pathway, as it does not occur in *d14* or *max2* mutants. This demonstrates a classic [negative feedback loop](@entry_id:145941): high levels of SLs are perceived by the D14-MAX2 pathway, which in turn signals to downregulate SL biosynthesis, thereby preventing excessive accumulation of the hormone.

**Feedforward control**, in contrast, occurs when an external or upstream signal modulates a pathway to anticipate future needs, often acting independently of the pathway's own feedback loop. The SL pathway is a prime example of this. Environmental cues like low phosphate availability or developmental signals like auxin can strongly induce the expression of SL biosynthetic genes. This induction remains intact even in *d14* and *max2* mutants, proving that it operates through a separate signaling route that bypasses the canonical SL perception machinery. This feedforward logic allows the plant to proactively increase SL production in response to conditions where it is beneficial—for example, to promote root system development and symbiotic interactions to forage for scarce phosphate.

### An Evolutionary Perspective: Divergence of D14 and KAI2

The [strigolactone signaling](@entry_id:155611) module did not arise in a vacuum. It is the product of a fascinating evolutionary history involving gene duplication and [functional divergence](@entry_id:171068). Its story is intertwined with that of a related signaling pathway controlled by the receptor **KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2)** [@problem_id:2610870].

Phylogenetic evidence indicates that KAI2 is the more ancient receptor, present in early land plants like [bryophytes](@entry_id:140840), which lack a true D14 ortholog. The ancestral KAI2 pathway likely regulated fundamental developmental processes, such as seedling germination and [photomorphogenesis](@entry_id:266665), in response to an unknown endogenous karrikin-like ligand.

At the base of the seed plant lineage, approximately 350 million years ago, a crucial **gene duplication** event occurred, giving rise to two distinct lineages: one that would continue as KAI2, and another that would evolve into D14. This duplication provided the raw material for **[neofunctionalization](@entry_id:268563)**. The D14 copy accumulated mutations that reshaped its ligand-binding pocket, making it significantly larger and altering key "gatekeeper" residues. These structural changes adapted D14 to perceive a new class of larger molecules: the canonical [strigolactones](@entry_id:150774), whose own biosynthetic pathway was co-evolving through the diversification of MAX1 enzymes. This new D14-SL pathway was co-opted to regulate novel traits in [seed plants](@entry_id:138051), most notably [shoot branching](@entry_id:153563) architecture.

Meanwhile, the KAI2 lineage maintained its preference for smaller, karrikin-like molecules, including karrikins found in smoke (which promote germination after a fire) and the still-unidentified endogenous "KAI2-ligand" (KL). The structural basis for this specificity is the smaller binding pocket of KAI2, which sterically hinders the entry of larger canonical SLs [@problem_id:2610870] [@problem_id:2610901].

Remarkably, these two parallel pathways maintain their specificity despite sharing the same downstream F-box protein, MAX2. They achieve this by targeting different subfamilies of SMXL repressors: D14 activation leads to the degradation of SMXL6/7/8 to control branching, while KAI2 activation leads to the degradation of SMAX1/SMXL2 to control seedling development. This represents a beautiful example of how [gene duplication](@entry_id:150636) can lead to the evolution of parallel signaling channels that allow an organism to respond to distinct internal and external cues through a shared molecular component. Further diversification of the KAI2/D14 family in [parasitic plants](@entry_id:155226) has given rise to a [clade](@entry_id:171685) of Hyposensitive to Light (HTL) receptors, which have evolved hypersensitivity to host-derived SLs to trigger [germination](@entry_id:164251), highlighting the remarkable evolutionary plasticity of this receptor family [@problem_id:2610901].
