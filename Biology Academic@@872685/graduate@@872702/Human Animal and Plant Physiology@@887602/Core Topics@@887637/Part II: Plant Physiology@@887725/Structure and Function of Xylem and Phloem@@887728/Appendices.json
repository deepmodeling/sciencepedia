It is a standard, well-posed problem in fluid dynamics, known as Hagen-Poiseuille flow, applied to a simplified biological context. It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The numerical values provided are physically realistic. The request for a discussion of limitations acknowledges the idealized nature of the model.\n\nProceeding with solution.\n\nWe begin with the Navier–Stokes equations for an incompressible, Newtonian fluid in cylindrical coordinates $(r', \\theta', z')$, where $z'$ is the axial coordinate. The velocity vector is $\\vec{v} = (v_{r'}, v_{\\theta'}, v_{z'})$.\n\nDue to the stated assumptions, the problem simplifies significantly:\n1.  **Steady flow**: All time derivatives are zero, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Axisymmetric flow**: All derivatives with respect to the azimuthal angle are zero, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta'} = 0$, and the azimuthal velocity component is zero, $v_{\\theta'} = 0$.\n3.  **Fully developed flow**: The velocity profile does not change along the axial direction, which implies $\\frac{\\partial v_{z'}}{\\partial z'} = 0$.\n\nThe continuity equation for an incompressible fluid is $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0$, which in cylindrical coordinates is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r'} \\frac{\\partial (r' v_{r'})}{\\partial r'} + \\frac{1}{r'} \\frac{\\partial v_{\\theta'}}{\\partial \\theta'} + \\frac{\\partial v_{z'}}{\\partial z'} = 0 $$\nApplying the assumptions of axisymmetry and fully developed flow reduces this equation to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r'} \\frac{d(r' v_{r'})}{dr'} = 0 $$\nIntegrating yields $r' v_{r'} = \\mathrm{constant}$. Since the velocity must be finite at the centerline ($r'=0$), the constant must be zero, which means $v_{r'} = 0$. Thus, the only non-zero velocity component is the axial one, $v_{z'}$, which depends only on the radial coordinate, $v_{z'} = v_{z'}(r')$.\n\nNow we consider the $z'$-component of the Navier–Stokes momentum equation:\n$$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_{z'}}{\\partial t} + v_{r'} \\frac{\\partial v_{z'}}{\\partial r'} + \\frac{v_{\\theta'}}{r'} \\frac{\\partial v_{z'}}{\\partial \\theta'} + v_{z'} \\frac{\\partial v_{z'}}{\\partial z'} \\right) = - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z'} + \\eta \\left( \\frac{1}{r'} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r'} \\left( r' \\frac{\\partial v_{z'}}{\\partial r'} \\right) + \\frac{1}{(r')^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 v_{z'}}{\\partial (\\theta')^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_{z'}}{\\partial (z')^2} \\right) $$\nUnder our simplifications, the left-hand side (inertial terms) becomes zero. The equation reduces to a balance between the pressure gradient and viscous forces:\n$$ 0 = - \\frac{d p}{d z'} + \\frac{\\eta}{r'} \\frac{d}{dr'} \\left( r' \\frac{d v_{z'}}{dr'} \\right) $$\nFor fully developed flow in a pipe of constant cross-section, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dz'}$ must be a constant. We can express this constant in terms of the total pressure drop $\\Delta P$ over the length $L$. Since pressure drops in the direction of flow, we write $\\frac{dp}{dz'} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r'} \\frac{d}{dr'} \\left( r' \\frac{d v_{z'}}{dr'} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\frac{dp}{dz'} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\eta L} $$\nWe integrate this ordinary differential equation twice. First integration with respect to $r'$:\n$$ r' \\frac{d v_{z'}}{dr'} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} (r')^2 + C_1 $$\n$$ \\frac{d v_{z'}}{dr'} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} r' + \\frac{C_1}{r'} $$\nSecond integration:\n$$ v_{z'}(r') = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} (r')^2 + C_1 \\ln(r') + C_2 $$\nWe apply boundary conditions to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n1.  The velocity at the centerline ($r'=0$) must be finite. As $\\ln(r') \\to -\\infty$ for $r' \\to 0$, we must have $C_1=0$.\n2.  The no-slip condition at the vessel wall ($r'=r$) requires $v_{z'}(r) = 0$.\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} r^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P r^2}{4 \\eta L} $$\nSubstituting the constants back gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ v_{z'}(r') = \\frac{\\Delta P r^2}{4 \\eta L} - \\frac{\\Delta P (r')^2}{4 \\eta L} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} (r^2 - (r')^2) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is found by integrating this velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the vessel. We use an annular area element $dA = 2 \\pi r' dr'$:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{r} v_{z'}(r') \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} (r^2 - (r')^2) (2 \\pi r' dr') $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{2 \\pi \\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} \\int_{0}^{r} (r^2 r' - (r')^3) dr' = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left[ \\frac{r^2 (r')^2}{2} - \\frac{(r')^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{r} $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis yields the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L} $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given parameters.

These conduits are of finite length and are linked via perforation plates and pits, which add significant hydraulic resistance not captured by the smooth pipe model. Vessel diameters also vary. The overall conductivity of wood depends on this network topology.\n2.  **Phase Change and Embolism**: The model assumes a continuous, single-phase liquid. However, the water in xylem is under substantial tension (negative pressure). This makes the water column metastable and susceptible to cavitation—the spontaneous formation of water vapor bubbles (embolisms) that block flow.
