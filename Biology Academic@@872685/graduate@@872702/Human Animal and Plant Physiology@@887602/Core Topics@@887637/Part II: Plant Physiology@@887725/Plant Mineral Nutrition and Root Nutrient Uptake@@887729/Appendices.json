This is a classic and fundamental problem in soil science and plant physiology. The concept of an effective diffusion coefficient that accounts for soil properties like tortuosity ($\\phi_{\\mathrm{d}}$) and buffering capacity ($b$) is a standard, scientifically sound approach (e.g., the Nye-Tinker model). All concepts are based on established physical laws.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is formulated as a boundary value problem for a second-order ordinary differential equation. The geometry (cylindrical) and boundary conditions (concentration specified at two different radii) are clearly defined. This structure ensures a unique and stable solution for the concentration profile and the resulting flux.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information to derive the symbolic solution and calculate the final requested ratio. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The parameters given are within physically realistic ranges for a soil-plant system. The \"perfect sink\" assumption is a common and useful idealization in cases where uptake kinetics are much faster than diffusion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a valid problem. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem must be solved starting from Fick's first law and the principle of mass conservation at steady state in cylindrical coordinates.\n\nLet $C(r)$ be the phosphate concentration in the soil solution at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the root. Fick's first law gives the radial diffusive flux density, $\\mathcal{F}_{r}$ (amount per unit area per unit time), as:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}_{r} = -D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{dC}{dr} $$\nwhere $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the effective diffusion coefficient in the soil.\n\nFor steady-state mass conservation with only radial diffusion and no sources or sinks in the soil medium itself, the divergence of the flux density must be zero. In cylindrical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}(r \\mathcal{F}_{r}) = 0 $$\nThis implies that the quantity $r \\mathcal{F}_{r}$ is a constant. Let's call this constant $K$:\n$$ r \\mathcal{F}_{r} = r \\left(-D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) = K $$\nThe total influx per unit length of the root, $J$, is the total amount of phosphate crossing a cylindrical surface of radius $r$ and unit length, per unit time. The direction of influx is opposite to the radial unit vector.\n$$ J = - (2\\pi r \\times 1) \\mathcal{F}_{r} = -2\\pi (r \\mathcal{F}_{r}) = -2\\pi K $$\nSince $J$ is the influx, it is a positive quantity, meaning phosphate flows towards the root at $r=0$. The concentration $C(r)$ must therefore increase with $r$, so $\\frac{dC}{dr} > 0$. This implies $\\mathcal{F}_{r}$ is negative, and $K$ is negative. Let's define $J = 2\\pi r D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{dC}{dr}$. Since the influx $J$ is constant at steady state, we can write the governing ordinary differential equation for $C(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\frac{1}{r} $$\nThis equation is separable. We integrate it with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\int dC = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\int \\frac{1}{r} dr $$\nThis yields the general solution for the concentration profile:\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r) + A $$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration.\n\nTo find the specific solution, we apply the two boundary conditions. Let $r_{\\text{abs}}$ be the radius of the absorbing surface.\n1. At the outer boundary, $r=R$, the concentration is $C_{0}$:\n   $$ C(R) = C_{0} = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(R) + A $$\n2. At the absorbing surface, $r=r_{\\text{abs}}$, the concentration is zero (perfect sink):\n   $$ C(r_{\\text{abs}}) = 0 = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}}) + A $$\n\nWe solve this system for the two unknowns, $J$ and $A$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$$ C_{0} - 0 = \\left(\\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(R) + A\\right) - \\left(\\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}}) + A\\right) $$\n$$ C_{0} = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} (\\ln(R) - \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}})) = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{\\text{abs}}}\\right) $$\nSolving for the influx per unit length, $J$:\n$$ J = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\text{abs}})} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the steady diffusive influx per unit root length.\n\nTo find the concentration profile $C(r)$, we first find $A$ from the second boundary condition: $A = -\\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}})$. Substituting this into the general solution:\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r) - \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}}) = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\text{abs}}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $J$ gives the final form for the concentration profile:\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\text{abs}})} \\frac{1}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\text{abs}}}\\right) = C_{0} \\frac{\\ln(r/r_{\\text{abs}})}{\\ln(R/r_{\\text{abs}})} $$\nThese are the general derivations for influx and concentration profile, as requested.\n\nNow, we apply these results to the two genotypes.\nFor the wild type (wt), the absorbing radius is $r_{\\text{abs}} = r_{\\mathrm{wt}} = r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}$. The influx is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{wt}} = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{wt}})} = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/(r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}))} $$\nFor the mutant (mut), the absorbing radius is $r_{\\text{abs}} = r_{\\mathrm{mut}} = r_{\\mathrm{r}}$. The influx is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{mut}} = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{mut}})} = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{r}})} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional reduction in uptake, $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{wt}} - J_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{J_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = 1 - \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{J_{\\mathrm{wt}}} $$\nWe compute the ratio $\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{J_{\\mathrm{wt}}}$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{J_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{r}})}}{\\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/(r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}))}} = \\frac{\\ln(R/(r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}))}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{r}})} $$\nNote that the physical parameters $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ and $C_{0}$ cancel, so the fractional reduction depends only on the geometry of the system.\nSubstituting this ratio back into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = 1 - \\frac{\\ln(R/(r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}))}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{r}})} $$\n\nNow, a numerical calculation is performed using the provided values.

By calculating the respiratory carbon expenditure and the resulting impact on rhizosphere pH for each, you will uncover the profound and contrasting physiological consequences that stem from a plant's \"choice\" of nitrogen source.", "problem": "A hydroponically grown plant assimilates inorganic nitrogen entirely in its roots over a short interval during which exactly $1.000\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$ of nitrogen is taken up and incorporated into amino acids. Two separate cases are considered: uptake and assimilation of nitrate ($\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$) versus uptake and assimilation of ammonium ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$). You will compute, for each case, the respiratory carbon cost and the net rhizosphere hydrogen ion change expressed as a rhizosphere $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$, using the following assumptions that reflect well-tested biochemical and biophysical facts.\n\nAssumptions for nitrogen assimilation stoichiometry in roots:\n1. Nitrate reduction and ammonium assimilation proceed via the canonical cytosolic nitrate reductase and plastidial (or plastid-equivalent) nitrite reductase, followed by the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase (GS/GOGAT) cycle. The net reducing equivalent demand to convert $\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$ to $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ is $8$ electrons per mole of nitrogen. Glutamate synthase consumes $2$ electrons per mole of nitrogen assimilated, and glutamine synthetase consumes $1$ adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per mole of nitrogen assimilated. For ammonium assimilation (without prior nitrate reduction), the GS/GOGAT sequence requires $2$ electrons and $1$ ATP per mole of nitrogen assimilated.\n2. Treat all reducing equivalents in terms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in reduced form (NADH) equivalents; that is, $2$ electrons are supplied by $1$ mole of NAD(P)H, which is met by diverting $1$ mole of respiratory NADH (assume negligible extra cost for transhydrogenation between NADH and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).\n3. Transport energetics and rhizosphere acid-base: The plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase extrudes $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ per mole of ATP hydrolyzed. Nitrate uptake is mediated by 1:1 symport with $\\mathrm{H^+}$, so that for each mole of $\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$ taken up, $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ enters with it and must be re-extruded at the cost of $1$ ATP to maintain the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ electrochemical gradient. Ammonium enters effectively as a cational equivalent (assume electroneutral entry of $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ followed by protonation inside), so electroneutrality requires net extrusion of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ per mole of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ assimilated; this also costs $1$ ATP via the $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase. Neglect any additional co-transport costs or leakage.\n4. Respiratory energy and carbon bookkeeping: Complete mitochondrial oxidation of $1$ mole of glucose to $\\mathrm{6\\,CO_2}$ yields $10$ moles of NADH, $2$ moles of flavin adenine dinucleotide in reduced form ($\\mathrm{FADH_2}$), and $4$ moles of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation yields $2.5$ ATP per NADH and $1.5$ ATP per $\\mathrm{FADH_2}$. Any NADH diverted to assimilation is unavailable for oxidative phosphorylation and thus reduces ATP yield accordingly. Assume that all ATP and reducing equivalents required for assimilation and transport are supplied by respiration, and neglect any additional carbon costs for synthesis of carbon skeletons beyond what is implicit in the ATP/NADH demands.\n5.

The assumptions provided are explicit and based on established principles of plant biochemistry and biophysics. Therefore, the problem is valid and a rigorous solution can be derived. We proceed by analyzing the two cases, assimilation of nitrate ($\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$) and ammonium ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$), separately.\n\nFirst, we establish the general relationship between glucose oxidation and the provision of energy (ATP) and reducing equivalents (NADH). According to assumption 4, the complete oxidation of $g$ moles of glucose ($\\mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6}$) yields $10g$ moles of NADH, $2g$ moles of $\\mathrm{FADH_2}$, and $4g$ moles of ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP). The total ATP yield from oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) is $(2.5 \\times \\text{moles of NADH}) + (1.5 \\times \\text{moles of FADH_2})$.\n\nLet $NADH_{demand}$ and $ATP_{demand}$ be the moles of NADH and ATP required per mole of nitrogen assimilated. The NADH used for assimilation, $NADH_{demand}$, is diverted from respiration and thus does not contribute to ATP synthesis. The amount of glucose oxidized, $g$, must be sufficient to meet both demands.\n\nThe amount of NADH produced from oxidizing $g$ moles of glucose is $10g$. This must be greater than or equal to the demand:\n$$10g \\ge NADH_{demand} \\implies g \\ge \\frac{NADH_{demand}}{10}$$\n\nThe total ATP synthesized when $g$ moles of glucose are oxidized to support an assimilation demand of $NADH_{demand}$ is:\n$$ATP_{produced} = ATP_{SLP} + ATP_{OxPhos}$$\n$$ATP_{produced} = 4g + 2.5 \\times (10g - NADH_{demand}) + 1.5 \\times (2g)$$\n$$ATP_{produced} = 4g + 25g - 2.5 \\times NADH_{demand} + 3g$$\n$$ATP_{produced} = 32g - 2.5 \\times NADH_{demand}$$\nThis amount must be greater than or equal to the ATP demand:\n$$32g - 2.5 \\times NADH_{demand} \\ge ATP_{demand} \\implies g \\ge \\frac{ATP_{demand} + 2.5 \\times NADH_{demand}}{32}$$\n\nThe minimal quantity of glucose, $g_{min}$, required per mole of nitrogen is the amount that satisfies both constraints. It is therefore the maximum of the two lower bounds:\n$$g_{min} = \\max\\left(\\frac{NADH_{demand}}{10}, \\frac{ATP_{demand} + 2.5 \\times NADH_{demand}}{32}\\right)$$\nThe respiratory carbon cost, $C$, is the moles of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ evolved per mole of N assimilated. Since $1$ mole of glucose produces $6$ moles of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, we have $C = 6 \\times g_{min}$. The units $\\mathrm{mol\\ CO_2 / mol\\ N}$ are numerically equivalent to $\\mathrm{mmol\\ CO_2 / mmol\\ N}$.\n\nThe change in rhizosphere pH is given by assumption 5 as $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = -\\frac{\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H^+}}^{\\mathrm{medium}}}{\\beta V}$, where $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H^+}}^{\\mathrm{medium}}$ is the net change in moles of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ in the medium.\n\nNow we apply this framework to each nitrogen source for the assimilation of $1.000 \\,\\mathrm{mmol}$ of N. All calculations will be presented per mole of N.\n\n**Case 1: Nitrate ($\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$) Assimilation**\n\n**a) Carbon Cost ($C_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}}$):**\nFirst, we determine the total NADH and ATP demand per mole of $\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$ assimilated.\n- **Assimilation (Assumption 1):** The reduction of $\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$ to $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ requires $8$ electrons, equivalent to $8/2 = 4$ moles of NADH. The subsequent assimilation of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ via the GS/GOGAT cycle requires $2$ electrons ($1$ mole of NADH) and $1$ mole of ATP. Total assimilation demand is $4+1 = 5$ moles of NADH and $1$ mole of ATP.\n- **Transport (Assumption 3):** Uptake of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$ involves a $1:1$ symport with $\\mathrm{H^+}$. Re-extrusion of this $\\mathrm{H^+}$ to maintain the proton motive force costs $1$ mole of ATP.\n- **Total Demand:**\n$$NADH_{demand, NO_3} = 5 \\,\\mathrm{mol/mol\\ N}$$\n$$ATP_{demand, NO_3} = 1 (\\text{assimilation}) + 1 (\\text{transport}) = 2 \\,\\mathrm{mol/mol\\ N}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the minimal glucose required, $g_{min, NO_3}$:\n$$g_{min, NO_3} = \\max\\left(\\frac{5}{10}, \\frac{2 + 2.5 \\times 5}{32}\\right) = \\max\\left(0.5, \\frac{14.5}{32}\\right) = \\max(0.5, 0.453125) = 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{mol\\ glucose/mol\\ N}$$\nThe process is limited by the NADH requirement.\nThe carbon cost is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}} = 6 \\times g_{min, NO_3} = 6 \\times 0.5 = 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{mol\\ CO_2/mol\\ N}$$\n\n**b) Rhizosphere pH Change ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}}$):**\nFor the plant to maintain electroneutrality while assimilating an anion ($\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$) into a neutral organic form, it must effect a net uptake of one mole of positive charge or efflux of one mole of negative charge from the medium for every mole of $\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$ assimilated. This results in a net consumption of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ from the rhizosphere, or an efflux of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ or $\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$, both of which lead to an increase in pH. For $1.000 \\,\\mathrm{mmol}$ of $\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$ assimilation, the change in moles of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ in the medium is $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H^+}}^{\\mathrm{medium}} = -1.000 \\,\\mathrm{mmol}$.\nUsing the given parameters $V = 1.000\\,\\mathrm{L}$ and $\\beta = 10.00\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\ H^+} \\,\\mathrm{pH^{-1}}\\,\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}} = -\\frac{\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H^+}}^{\\mathrm{medium}}}{\\beta V} = -\\frac{-1.000 \\,\\mathrm{mmol}}{(10.00 \\,\\mathrm{mmol\\ pH^{-1}\\ L^{-1}}) \\times (1.000\\,\\mathrm{L})} = +0.1000$$\n\n**Case 2: Ammonium ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$) Assimilation**\n\n**a) Carbon Cost ($C_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}}$):**\n- **Assimilation (Assumption 1):** Assimilation via GS/GOGAT requires $2$ electrons ($1$ mole of NADH) and $1$ mole of ATP.\n- **Transport (Assumption 3):** To maintain electroneutrality during assimilation of the cation $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$, $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ must be extruded per mole of N, at a cost of $1$ mole of ATP.\n- **Total Demand:**\n$$NADH_{demand, NH_4} = 1 \\,\\mathrm{mol/mol\\ N}$$\n$$ATP_{demand, NH_4} = 1 (\\text{assimilation}) + 1 (\\text{transport}) = 2 \\,\\mathrm{mol/mol\\ N}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the minimal glucose required, $g_{min, NH_4}$:\n$$g_{min, NH_4} = \\max\\left(\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{2 + 2.5 \\times 1}{32}\\right) = \\max\\left(0.1, \\frac{4.5}{32}\\right) = \\max(0.1, 0.140625) = 0.140625 \\,\\mathrm{mol\\ glucose/mol\\ N}$$\nThe process is limited by the ATP requirement.\nThe carbon cost is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} = 6 \\times g_{min, NH_4} = 6 \\times 0.140625 = 0.84375 \\,\\mathrm{mol\\ CO_2/mol\\ N}$$\n\n**b) Rhizosphere pH Change ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}}$):**\nAssumption 3 explicitly states that electroneutrality requires the net extrusion of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ into the medium for each mole of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ assimilated. This acidifies the rhizosphere. For $1.000\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$ of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ assimilation, the change in moles of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ in the medium is $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H^+}}^{\\mathrm{medium}} = +1.000\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$.\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} = -\\frac{\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H^+}}^{\\mathrm{medium}}}{\\beta V} = -\\frac{+1.000\\,\\mathrm{mmol}}{(10.00 \\,\\mathrm{mmol\\ pH^{-1}\\ L^{-1}}) \\times (1.000\\,\\mathrm{L})} = -0.1000$$\n\n**Final Answer Assembly:**\nThe requested values are $[C_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}},\\, \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}},\\, C_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}},\\, \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}}]$.\nThe calculated exact values are $[3.0, 0.1, 0.84375, -0.1]$.\nRounding each to four significant figures gives:\n- $C_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}} = 3.000$\n- $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}} = 0.1000$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} = 0.8438$\n- $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} = -0.1000$\n\nThe final result is presented as a row vector.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3.000 & 0.1000 & 0.8438 & -0.1000\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2598598"}]}
