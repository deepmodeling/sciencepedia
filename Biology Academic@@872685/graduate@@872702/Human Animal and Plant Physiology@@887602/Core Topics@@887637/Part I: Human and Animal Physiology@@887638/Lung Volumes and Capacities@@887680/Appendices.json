The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested. First, the derivation of the expression for alveolar ventilation, $\\dot{V}_{A}$. Second, the numerical evaluation of the ratio for the specified breathing patterns.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Alveolar Ventilation ($\\dot{V}_{A}$)\nBy definition, the tidal volume ($V_{T}$) is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled in a single breath. This volume is partitioned into two components. One part fills the conducting airways, the volume of which is the anatomical dead space ($V_{D}$). This air does not participate in gas exchange. The remaining part of the tidal volume reaches the alveoli and constitutes the alveolar volume ($V_{A,\\text{breath}}$) for that breath.\nBased on the principle of conservation of volume for a single inspiration, we have:\n$$V_{T} = V_{A,\\text{breath}} + V_{D}$$\nFrom this, the volume of fresh gas reaching the alveoli in a single breath is:\n$$V_{A,\\text{breath}} = V_{T} - V_{D}$$\nAlveolar ventilation, $\\dot{V}_{A}$, is defined as the total volume of fresh gas entering the alveoli per unit time. It is the product of the respiratory frequency ($f$) and the alveolar volume per breath ($V_{A,\\text{breath}}$):\n$$\\dot{V}_{A} = f \\times V_{A,\\text{breath}} = f \\times (V_{T} - V_{D})$$\nThe problem requires an expression in terms of minute ventilation ($\\dot{V}_{E}$), tidal volume ($V_{T}$), and dead space volume ($V_{D}$). The minute ventilation is defined as $\\dot{V}_{E} = f \\times V_{T}$. From this definition, we can express the frequency as $f = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{E}}{V_{T}}$.\nSubstituting this expression for $f$ into the equation for $\\dot{V}_{A}$ yields:\n$$\\dot{V}_{A} = \\left(\\frac{\\dot{V}_{E}}{V_{T}}\\right) \\times (V_{T} - V_{D})$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more instructive form:\n$$\\dot{V}_{A} = \\dot{V}_{E} \\left(1 - \\frac{V_{D}}{V_{T}}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression. It demonstrates that for a fixed minute ventilation $\\dot{V}_{E}$, the alveolar ventilation $\\dot{V}_{A}$ is determined by the ratio of dead space to tidal volume. A larger tidal volume diminishes the wasteful effect of the constant dead space.\n\nPart 2: Numerical Evaluation of the Ratio $R$\nWe now apply the fundamental formula $\\dot{V}_{A} = f \\times (V_{T} - V_{D})$ to calculate the alveolar ventilation for each of the two breathing patterns. All volumes are in mL and frequency is in breaths/min, so the resulting ventilation will be in mL/min.\n\nFor the shallow–rapid pattern (subscript S):\n$f_{S} = 30$ min$^{-1}$\n$V_{T,S} = 200$ mL\n$V_{D} = 150$ mL\nThe alveolar ventilation is:\n$$\\dot{V}_{A,S} = f_{S} \\times (V_{T,S} - V_{D}) = 30 \\times (200 - 150) = 30 \\times 50 = 1500 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nFor the deep–slow pattern (subscript D):\n$f_{D} = 10$ min$^{-1}$\n$V_{T,D} = 600$ mL\n$V_{D} = 150$ mL\nThe alveolar ventilation is:\n$$\\dot{V}_{A,D} = f_{D} \\times (V_{T,D} - V_{D}) = 10 \\times (600 - 150) = 10 \\times 450 = 4500 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{A,D}}{\\dot{V}_{A,S}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$R = \\frac{4500}{1500} = 3$$\nThe result is a dimensionless number, confirming the dimensional consistency of the calculation. This result demonstrates that for the same total minute ventilation, the deep, slow breathing pattern is three times more effective at ventilating the alveoli than the shallow, rapid pattern.

The problem requires a standard derivation and calculation, not a trivial exercise.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid. A solution will be produced.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is that the amount of dry gas exhaled from the lungs is conserved when measured by the spirometer. Let $n_{dry}$ be the number of moles of dry gas. We can apply the ideal gas law, $PV=nRT$, to this constant amount of dry gas under two different sets of conditions: Body Temperature and Pressure Saturated (BTPS) and Ambient Temperature and Pressure Saturated (ATPS).\n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure of the gas mixture, which is the barometric pressure $P_B$, is the sum of the partial pressure of the dry gas, $P_{dry}$, and the partial pressure of the water vapor, $P_{H_2O}$. Therefore, the partial pressure of the dry gas is given by:\n$$P_{dry} = P_B - P_{H_2O}$$\n\nWe apply this to the two states.\n\n**State 1: Inside the lungs (BTPS conditions)**\nThe gas is at body temperature, $T_{BTPS}$, and is saturated with water vapor at this temperature. The volume is the true vital capacity, $V_{BTPS}$. The partial pressure of the dry gas is $P_{dry, BTPS} = P_B - P_{H_2O, BTPS}$. The ideal gas law for the dry gas component is:\n$$ (P_B - P_{H_2O, BTPS}) V_{BTPS} = n_{dry} R T_{BTPS} $$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n\n**State 2: Inside the spirometer (ATPS conditions)**\nThe gas has cooled to the ambient temperature, $T_{ATPS}$, and remains saturated with water vapor, but now at this lower temperature. The measured volume is $V_{ATPS}$. The partial pressure of the dry gas is $P_{dry, ATPS} = P_B - P_{H_2O, ATPS}$. The ideal gas law for the dry gas component is:\n$$ (P_B - P_{H_2O, ATPS}) V_{ATPS} = n_{dry} R T_{ATPS} $$\n\nSince $n_{dry}$ and $R$ are constants, we can equate the expressions for $n_{dry}R$ from both states:\n$$ \\frac{(P_B - P_{H_2O, BTPS}) V_{BTPS}}{T_{BTPS}} = \\frac{(P_B - P_{H_2O, ATPS}) V_{ATPS}}{T_{ATPS}} $$\n\nThis equation establishes the relationship between the volumes, pressures, and temperatures in the two states. The task requires deriving the relation for the BTPS-corrected volume, $V_{BTPS}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $V_{BTPS}$:\n$$ V_{BTPS} = V_{ATPS} \\cdot \\frac{P_B - P_{H_2O, ATPS}}{P_B - P_{H_2O, BTPS}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{BTPS}}{T_{ATPS}} $$\nThis is the required general relation for BTPS correction.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. First, all temperatures must be converted to the absolute Kelvin scale using the provided formula $T[\\mathrm{K}]=T[^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}]+273.15$:\n$$ T_{ATPS} = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ T_{BTPS} = 37 + 273.15 = 310.15\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n- $V_{ATPS} = 3.60\\ \\mathrm{L}$\n- $P_B = 748\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{H_2O, ATPS} = 17.5\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{H_2O, BTPS} = 47.0\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $T_{ATPS} = 293.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_{BTPS} = 310.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\n$$ V_{BTPS} = 3.60\\ \\mathrm{L} \\cdot \\frac{748 - 17.5}{748 - 47.0} \\cdot \\frac{310.15}{293.15} $$\n$$ V_{BTPS} = 3.60 \\cdot \\frac{730.5}{701.0} \\cdot \\frac{310.15}{293.15} $$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ V_{BTPS} \\approx 3.60 \\cdot (1.0420827...) \\cdot (1.0580009...) $$\n$$ V_{BTPS} \\approx 3.60 \\cdot (1.102524...) $$\n$$ V_{BTPS} \\approx 3.969086...\\ \\mathrm{L} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ V_{BTPS} \\approx 3.97\\ \\mathrm{L} $$\n\nThe correction factor is significant, as the volume occupied by a given amount of gas increases with temperature and decreases with the partial pressure of dry gas.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass conservation and the ideal gas law, relevant to the field of human physiology, and is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this measurement is the conservation of the amount (moles) of helium, an inert tracer gas, before and after it equilibrates between the spirometer circuit and the subject's lungs. Let $n_{\\text{He,1}}$ be the initial moles of helium and $n_{\\text{He,2}}$ be the final moles of helium. Conservation dictates:\n$$n_{\\text{He,1}} = n_{\\text{He,2}}$$\n\nWe can express the number of moles of a gas component using its mole fraction and the total number of moles of the mixture. Since the problem provides helium mole fractions on a dry gas basis, we will formulate the conservation equation in terms of dry gas volumes and mole fractions. The relationship is $n_{\\text{He}} = F_{\\text{He,dry}} \\times n_{\\text{gas,dry}}$. According to the ideal gas law, for a given pressure $P$ and temperature $T$, the number of moles $n$ is proportional to the volume $V$. Thus, if all volumes are expressed under identical conditions of temperature and pressure, we can write the conservation law in terms of volumes and concentrations:\n$$F_1 V_1 = F_2 V_2$$\nHere, $F_1$ and $F_2$ are the initial and final dry-gas mole fractions of helium, and $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the initial and final total volumes of dry gas through which the helium is distributed, respectively, all measured at a common reference state. We will use the ambient conditions—Ambient Temperature and Pressure, Dry (which we will denote as ATPS for simplicity in this context)—as our reference state.\n\n**Step 1: Calculation of Functional Residual Capacity at ATPS (dry)**\n\nThe initial state (state 1) consists of helium contained within the external circuit only. The volume of this circuit, $V_{\\text{circ}}$, is the sum of the spirometer volume and the apparatus dead space.

The helium has diluted into this larger total volume. The problem states that the dry gas volume in the external circuit is kept constant.
