Assume the system is at steady state during the collection, the infused polysaccharide is inert within the kidney and neither secreted nor reabsorbed, endogenous creatinine is produced at a constant rate with negligible extrarenal clearance, and the plasma concentrations reported are temporally matched to the midpoint of the urine collection.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the conservation of mass. For any substance $X$ cleared by the kidneys, under steady-state conditions, the rate at which the substance is excreted in the urine must equal the net rate at which it is removed from the blood by the kidneys.\n\nThe rate of excretion of a substance $X$ is the product of its concentration in the urine, $U_X$, and the urine flow rate, $\\dot{V}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Excretion} = U_X \\cdot \\dot{V} $$\nThe urine flow rate $\\dot{V}$ is calculated from the total collected urine volume $V_{\\text{total}}$ over the collection duration $t$:\n$$ \\dot{V} = \\frac{V_{\\text{total}}}{t} $$\nUsing the provided data:\n$$ \\dot{V} = \\frac{13.20 \\text{ mL}}{10.0 \\text{ min}} = 1.32 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} $$\n\nThe concept of renal clearance, $C_X$, is defined as the virtual volume of plasma from which a substance $X$ is completely removed per unit time. It is calculated as:\n$$ C_X = \\frac{U_X \\cdot \\dot{V}}{P_X} $$\nwhere $P_X$ is the plasma concentration of the substance.\n\nThe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered from the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time. For an ideal filtration marker that is freely filtered, not reabsorbed, and not secreted (like inulin, as stated in the problem), the amount excreted in the urine equals the amount that was filtered. The rate of filtration is $\\text{GFR} \\cdot P_X$. Thus, for such a substance:\n$$ U_X \\cdot \\dot{V} = \\text{GFR} \\cdot P_X $$\nFrom this, it is evident that the clearance of an ideal substance is equal to the GFR:\n$$ \\text{GFR} = \\frac{U_X \\cdot \\dot{V}}{P_X} = C_X $$\n\nFirst, we compute the GFR using the inulin data, as inulin is stated to behave as this ideal substance.\n$$ \\text{GFR}_{\\text{inulin}} = C_{\\text{inulin}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{inulin}} \\cdot \\dot{V}}{P_{\\text{inulin}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{GFR}_{\\text{inulin}} = \\frac{(49.5 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}) \\cdot (1.32 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}})}{0.450 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}} $$\nThe concentration units $\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}$ cancel out.\n$$ \\text{GFR}_{\\text{inulin}} = \\frac{49.5 \\cdot 1.32}{0.450} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = \\frac{65.34}{0.450} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = 145.2 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} $$\nThis value represents the true GFR under the experimental conditions.\n\nNext, we compute the GFR estimate using the creatinine data. The clearance of creatinine is used as a clinical estimate for GFR. We apply the same clearance formula.\n$$ \\text{GFR}_{\\text{creatinine}} = C_{\\text{creatinine}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{creatinine}} \\cdot \\dot{V}}{P_{\\text{creatinine}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{GFR}_{\\text{creatinine}} = \\frac{(145.2 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}) \\cdot (1.32 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}})}{1.10 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}} $$\n$$ \\text{GFR}_{\\text{creatinine}} = \\frac{145.2 \\cdot 1.32}{1.10} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = \\frac{191.664}{1.10} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = 174.24 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} $$\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\text{GFR}_{\\text{creatinine}}}{\\text{GFR}_{\\text{inulin}}} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{174.24 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}}{145.2 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}} = 1.2 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be reported to four significant figures. The exact calculated value is $1.2$. To express this to four significant figures, we write it as $1.200$.\n\nThe result $R > 1$ is physiologically significant. It demonstrates that the clearance of creatinine overestimates the true GFR (as measured by inulin clearance). This is a known phenomenon in renal physiology and is due to a small but significant amount of creatinine being actively secreted by the renal tubules, in addition to being filtered. This secretion adds creatinine to the tubular fluid beyond what was filtered, increasing the numerator $U_{\\text{creatinine}} \\cdot \\dot{V}$ in the clearance equation and thus artificially inflating the calculated clearance value relative to the true GFR.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.200}$$", "id": "2571880"}, {"introduction": "Knowing the $GFR$ is only part of the story; understanding how it relates to renal perfusion is crucial for a complete picture of kidney function.

At a defined location along a superficial glomerular capillary loop, steady-state pressures are measured as follows: the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure is $50$ mmHg, the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s space is $18$ mmHg, the glomerular capillary plasma oncotic pressure is $32$ mmHg, and the oncotic pressure in Bowman’s space (nonzero due to protein leak) is $4$ mmHg.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of renal physiology, specifically the Starling forces governing glomerular filtration. The provided data are consistent and sufficient to permit a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is well-posed and objective. We will now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe net movement of fluid across the glomerular filtration barrier is governed by the Starling principle. The net filtration pressure, denoted as $P_{net}$, is the algebraic sum of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures across the capillary wall. The general form of the Starling equation for fluid flux, $J_v$, is given by:\n\n$$J_v = K_f [ (P_{gc} - P_{bs}) - \\sigma (\\Pi_{gc} - \\Pi_{bs}) ]$$\n\nwhere $K_f$ is the filtration coefficient (a product of hydraulic conductivity and surface area), $P_{gc}$ is the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{bs}$ is the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space, $\\Pi_{gc}$ is the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure, $\\Pi_{bs}$ is the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space, and $\\sigma$ is the solvent-drag reflection coefficient for the solutes contributing to the oncotic pressure.\n\nThe term within the brackets represents the net filtration pressure, $P_{net}$:\n\n$$P_{net} = (P_{gc} - P_{bs}) - \\sigma (\\Pi_{gc} - \\Pi_{bs})$$\n\nThe problem statement requires deriving this expression from the perspective of forces favoring filtration versus forces opposing it. Let us identify these forces:\n$1$. Forces favoring filtration (movement of fluid from capillary to Bowman's space):\n    - Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure ($P_{gc}$), which pushes fluid out of the capillary.\n    - Oncotic pressure of Bowman's space ($\\Pi_{bs}$), which pulls fluid out of the capillary.\n\n$2$. Forces opposing filtration (retention of fluid in the capillary or movement into it):\n    - Hydrostatic pressure of Bowman's space ($P_{bs}$), which pushes fluid back into the capillary.\n    - Glomerular capillary oncotic pressure ($\\Pi_{gc}$), which pulls fluid into the capillary, effectively opposing its exit.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, the net filtration pressure is the sum of forces favoring filtration minus the sum of forces opposing filtration. Each oncotic pressure's contribution to the net driving force is scaled by the reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$. Thus, the expression is:\n\n$$P_{net} = (P_{gc} + \\sigma \\Pi_{bs}) - (P_{bs} + \\sigma \\Pi_{gc})$$\n\nRearranging this expression gives:\n\n$$P_{net} = P_{gc} - P_{bs} - \\sigma \\Pi_{gc} + \\sigma \\Pi_{bs} = (P_{gc} - P_{bs}) - \\sigma(\\Pi_{gc} - \\Pi_{bs})$$\n\nThis is identical to the standard formulation of the Starling equation for pressure.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $P_{gc} = 50$ mmHg\n- $P_{bs} = 18$ mmHg\n- $\\Pi_{gc} = 32$ mmHg\n- $\\Pi_{bs} = 4$ mmHg\n- The reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, is given to be effectively $1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $P_{net}$ with $\\sigma=1$:\n\n$$P_{net} = P_{gc} - P_{bs} - \\Pi_{gc} + \\Pi_{bs}$$\n$$P_{net} = 50 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 18 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 32 \\, \\text{mmHg} + 4 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\n\nLet us perform the calculation:\n\n$$P_{net} = (50 + 4) \\, \\text{mmHg} - (18 + 32) \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{net} = 54 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 50 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{net} = 4 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\n\nThe sign convention specified is that fluid movement from the capillary lumen into Bowman's space is positive.
