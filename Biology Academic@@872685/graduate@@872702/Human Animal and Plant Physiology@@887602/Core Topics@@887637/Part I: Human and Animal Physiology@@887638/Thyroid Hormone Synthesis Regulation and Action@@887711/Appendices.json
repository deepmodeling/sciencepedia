Three core defects can underlie this: the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS) that traps iodide across the basolateral membrane, Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) that organifies iodide and catalyzes coupling on Thyroglobulin (TG), and Thyroglobulin (TG) itself, the protein substrate that stores iodotyrosines and iodothyronines in the colloid. The perchlorate discharge test assesses organification by displacing non-organified intrathyroidal iodide; organified iodine bound to tyrosyl residues on TG is retained.\n\nA tracer dose of radioiodide is given at time $t=0$, and perchlorate is administered at time $t=t_0$. The following patients present with primary hypothyroidism and normal iodine nutrition:\n\n- Patient A: TSH $115$ mU/L, free thyroxine (T4) $4.0$ pmol/L, serum thyroglobulin (TG) $0.5$ ng/mL, $24$-hour radioiodide uptake $0.75$ (fraction of administered dose).\n- Patient B: TSH $98$ mU/L, free thyroxine (T4) $5.0$ pmol/L, serum thyroglobulin (TG) $110$ ng/mL, $24$-hour radioiodide uptake $0.80$ (fraction of administered dose).\n- Patient C: TSH $92$ mU/L, free thyroxine (T4) $6.0$ pmol/L, serum thyroglobulin (TG) $25$ ng/mL, $24$-hour radioiodide uptake $0.01$ (fraction of administered dose).\n\nAssume thyroid autoantibodies are negative and urinary iodide excretion is normal in all three.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of thyroid physiology and pathology, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and structured to allow for a unique, meaningful solution based on logical deduction and mathematical modeling. The clinical scenarios and kinetic model are standard representations in endocrinology and nuclear medicine.\n\nThe first task is to identify the patient with a Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) defect by analyzing the provided clinical data. The unifying feature of all three patients is primary hypothyroidism, evidenced by a markedly elevated Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level and a low free thyroxine (T4) level. This condition results from the failure of the thyroid gland itself. The high TSH is a compensatory response from the pituitary, which strongly stimulates two key thyroid processes: growth of the gland and uptake of iodide via the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS).\n\nWe analyze each patient's profile in the context of congenital dyshormonogenesis:\n- **Patient C** presents with a very low $24$-hour radioiodide uptake (RAIU) of $0.01$. Despite the intense stimulation by a high TSH ($92$ mU/L), the thyroid gland is unable to trap iodide from the bloodstream. This is the definitive characteristic of a defect in the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS), the protein responsible for iodide trapping.\n- **Patient A** exhibits a very high RAIU ($0.75$), indicating that iodide trapping via NIS is not only functional but hyper-stimulated, which is expected with a TSH of $115$ mU/L. However, the serum thyroglobulin (TG) level is exceptionally low ($0.5$ ng/mL). TG is the protein matrix essential for hormone synthesis. Its near-absence in serum, despite maximal TSH stimulation, points directly to a defect in TG synthesis or secretion.\n- **Patient B** shows a very high RAIU ($0.80$), confirming robust iodide trapping by NIS under high TSH ($98$ mU/L). Unlike Patient A, the serum TG is very high ($110$ ng/mL), indicating that the gland is producing the TG protein scaffold in large amounts. The combination of successful iodide trapping (ruling out NIS defect) and adequate TG substrate (ruling out TG defect) with persistent hypothyroidism (low T4) implies a block in a subsequent step: the incorporation of iodide onto TG (organification) or the coupling of iodotyrosines to form hormones. Both of these steps are catalyzed by Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO). Therefore, Patient B's profile is most consistent with a TPO defect.\n\nThe second task is to calculate the perchlorate discharge fraction, $D$, for Patient B, who is identified as the TPO-defect patient. We are given a two-compartment model for intrathyroidal tracer kinetics before the administration of perchlorate at time $t_0$.\n\nThe dynamics of the inorganic iodide pool, $I(t)$, are described by the differential equation:\n$$ \\dfrac{dI}{dt} = J - (k_2 + k_3)I(t) $$\nwith the initial condition $I(0)=0$. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by rearranging and integrating. Let $k_{sum} = k_2 + k_3$.\n$$ \\dfrac{dI}{dt} + k_{sum}I(t) = J $$\nThe integrating factor is $\\mu(t) = \\exp(\\int k_{sum} dt) = \\exp(k_{sum}t)$. Multiplying the equation by $\\mu(t)$ gives:\n$$ \\exp(k_{sum}t)\\dfrac{dI}{dt} + k_{sum}\\exp(k_{sum}t)I(t) = J\\exp(k_{sum}t) $$\n$$ \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(I(t)\\exp(k_{sum}t)\\right) = J\\exp(k_{sum}t) $$\nIntegrating with respect to time:\n$$ I(t)\\exp(k_{sum}t) = \\int J\\exp(k_{sum}t) dt = \\frac{J}{k_{sum}}\\exp(k_{sum}t) + C $$\nSolving for $I(t)$:\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{J}{k_{sum}} + C\\exp(-k_{sum}t) $$\nUsing the initial condition $I(0)=0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{J}{k_{sum}} + C \\implies C = -\\frac{J}{k_{sum}} $$\nThus, the solution for the inorganic iodide pool is:\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{J}{k_{sum}}\\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{sum}t)\\right) = \\frac{J}{k_2+k_3}\\left(1 - \\exp(-(k_2+k_3)t)\\right) $$\n\nNext, we solve for the organified iodine pool, $O(t)$, governed by:\n$$ \\dfrac{dO}{dt} = k_3 I(t) $$\nwith the initial condition $O(0)=0$.

We can write the relationship as:\n$$P = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{\\eta}$$\nThis implies $P \\propto \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{\\eta}$, since $P_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ is proportional to $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ and the free energy of ATP hydrolysis is assumed constant.\n\nThe new resting metabolic power, $P_{1}$, can be expressed in terms of the baseline power, $P_{0}$, by considering the changes in total ATP demand and mitochondrial efficiency.\nFor the baseline state (subscript $0$):\n$$P_{0} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}}{\\eta_{0}}$$\nFor the new state (subscript $1$):\n$$P_{1} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{ATP},1}}{\\eta_{1}}$$\nDividing these two equations gives the ratio:\n$$\\frac{P_{1}}{P_{0}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{ATP},1}}{P_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}} \\cdot \\frac{\\eta_{0}}{\\eta_{1}}$$\nTherefore, the new power is:\n$$P_{1} = P_{0} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{ATP},1}}{J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\eta_{0}}{\\eta_{1}}\\right)$$\nWe must now determine the two ratios on the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of total ATP hydrolysis fluxes, $\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{ATP},1}}{J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}}$.\nThe total flux is the sum of the flux for the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase and all other fluxes: $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = J_{\\mathrm{NaK}} + J_{\\mathrm{other}}$.\nIn the new state:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{ATP},1} = J_{\\mathrm{NaK},1} + J_{\\mathrm{other},1}$$\nUsing the given relationships: $J_{\\mathrm{NaK},1} = f_{\\mathrm{NK}}J_{\\mathrm{NaK},0}$ and $J_{\\mathrm{other},1} = J_{\\mathrm{other},0}$.\nSubstituting these, and the baseline partitioning $J_{\\mathrm{NaK},0} = \\varphi J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}$ and $J_{\\mathrm{other},0} = (1-\\varphi)J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{ATP},1} = f_{\\mathrm{NK}}(\\varphi J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}) + (1-\\varphi)J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{ATP},1} = J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0} (f_{\\mathrm{NK}}\\varphi + 1 - \\varphi) = J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0} (1 + (f_{\\mathrm{NK}} - 1)\\varphi)$$\nThe ratio of ATP fluxes is therefore:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{ATP},1}}{J_{\\mathrm{ATP},0}} = 1 + (f_{\\mathrm{NK}} - 1)\\varphi$$\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio of efficiencies, $\\frac{\\eta_{0}}{\\eta_{1}}$.\nWe are given the baseline efficiency $\\eta_{0}$ and a formula for the new leak fraction $\\ell_{1}$.

Substituting the expression for $\\ell_{1}$:\n$$\\eta_{1} = 1 - \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\ell_{0}}{(1-\\ell_{0}) + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\ell_{0}} = \\frac{(1-\\ell_{0}) + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\ell_{0} - f_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\ell_{0}}{(1-\\ell_{0}) + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\ell_{0}} = \\frac{1-\\ell_{0}}{(1-\\ell_{0}) + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\ell_{0}}$$\nSubstituting $\\eta_{0} = 1 - \\ell_{0}$:\n$$\\eta_{1} = \\frac{\\eta_{0}}{\\eta_{0} + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}(1-\\eta_{0})}$$\nThe ratio of efficiencies is then:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_{0}}{\\eta_{1}} = \\frac{\\eta_{0}}{\\frac{\\eta_{0}}{\\eta_{0} + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}(1-\\eta_{0})}} = \\eta_{0} + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}(1-\\eta_{0})$$\n\nNow, we combine these two factors to find the final expression for $P_{1}$:\n$$P_{1} = P_{0} \\cdot [1 + (f_{\\mathrm{NK}} - 1)\\varphi] \\cdot [\\eta_{0} + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}(1-\\eta_{0})]$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n$P_{0} = 80$ W\n$\\varphi = 0.35$\n$f_{\\mathrm{NK}} = 1.8$\n$\\eta_{0} = 0.75$\n$f_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 1.6$\n\nFirst, calculate the ATP demand factor:\n$$1 + (f_{\\mathrm{NK}} - 1)\\varphi = 1 + (1.8 - 1) \\times 0.35 = 1 + 0.8 \\times 0.35 = 1 + 0.28 = 1.28$$\nNext, calculate the efficiency factor:\n$$\\eta_{0} + f_{\\mathrm{leak}}(1-\\eta_{0}) = 0.75 + 1.6 \\times (1 - 0.75) = 0.75 + 1.6 \\times 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.4 = 1.15$$\nFinally, calculate the new power $P_{1}$:\n$$P_{1} = 80 \\times 1.28 \\times 1.15$$\n$$P_{1} = 80 \\times 1.472$$\n$$P_{1} = 117.76 \\text{ W}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P_{1} \\approx 117.8 \\text{ W}$$\nThis represents the new resting metabolic power of the patient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{117.8}$$", "id": "2619539"}]}
