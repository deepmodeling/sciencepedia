This current's dynamics are complex, featuring both voltage-dependent gating and a negative feedback loop where influxed Ca²⁺ inactivates the channel, a process known as calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI). This exercise guides you through building a computational model from first principles that integrates Hodgkin-Huxley gating with mass-action kinetics to simulate this crucial interplay, providing a foundational skill in cardiac electrophysiology modeling. [@problem_id:2567141]", "problem": "Construct, from first principles and without relying on prepackaged target formulas, a Hodgkin–Huxley style model for the L-type calcium current with both voltage-dependent inactivation and calcium-dependent inactivation. Begin from a two-state gating interpretation and mass-action kinetics, and use charge conservation to couple calcium influx to a submembrane calcium concentration that drives calcium-dependent inactivation. Your task is to derive the governing differential equations, define the current as an algebraic output of the gating variables and membrane voltage, and implement a numerical solver that simulates a square voltage-clamp protocol for a specified duration starting from a holding potential. The membrane voltage is clamped at a holding potential for initialization of gating variables, and then stepped to a target voltage at time $t=0$ for a fixed duration. The submembrane calcium concentration dynamically evolves due to the calcium current and a first-order removal term. The calcium-dependent inactivation gate is driven by calcium binding to an inactivation site via mass-action kinetics. The final output of your program must be the most negative current during the step (i.e., the minimum value of the current) and the current at the end of the step, for each test case.\n\nUse only the following foundational bases:\n- Two-state gating with forward and backward transitions governed by rates that depend on membrane voltage (for voltage-dependent gates) or on calcium concentration (for calcium-dependent inactivation), and that combine via linear mass-action ordinary differential equations.\n- The Hodgkin–Huxley decomposition of current into a maximal conductance multiplied by products of independent gating variables and a driving force.\n- Charge conservation that connects ionic current to changes in submembrane calcium concentration via Faraday’s constant.\n- Steady-state initialization at the holding potential by equating time derivatives to zero under constant conditions.\n\nYour program must implement the following constraints and parameter values, which are fixed for all test cases unless explicitly varied as part of a test case:\n- Membrane voltage during the holding phase: $V_{\\mathrm{hold}} = -0.08$ volts.\n- Step reversal potential for calcium: $E_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = +0.06$ volts.\n- Valence of calcium: $z = 2$.\n- Faraday’s constant: $F = 96485.33212$ coulombs per mole.\n- Maximal conductance: $g_{\\mathrm{CaL}} = 5\\times 10^{-7}$ siemens.\n- Activation gate exponent: $p = 2$.\n- Voltage-dependent activation gate $m$: use a two-state gate with steady-state value $m_{\\infty}(V)$ and time constant $\\tau_m(V)$, combined as a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. For numerical simulation, use a logistic steady-state $m_{\\infty}(V)$ with half-activation voltage $V_{m,1/2} = -0.01$ volts and slope factor $k_m = 0.006$ volts, and a voltage-independent time constant $\\tau_m = 0.003$ seconds.\n- Voltage-dependent inactivation gate $h$: use a two-state gate with steady-state $h_{\\infty}(V)$ and time constant $\\tau_h(V)$, combined as a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. For numerical simulation, use a logistic steady-state $h_{\\infty}(V)$ with half-inactivation voltage $V_{h,1/2} = -0.04$ volts and slope factor $k_h = 0.006$ volts, and a voltage-independent time constant $\\tau_h = 0.04$ seconds.\n- Calcium-dependent inactivation gate is implemented as an inactivated-bound fraction $b$ obeying mass-action binding with on-rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1.0\\times 10^{8}$ per molar per second and off-rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = K_d \\, k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, with dissociation constant $K_d = 5.0\\times 10^{-7}$ molar.

The calcium concentration obeys a first-order ordinary differential equation that sums the influx driven by the calcium current and the removal term.\n- The L-type calcium current during the step is the algebraic quantity $I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}(t) = g_{\\mathrm{CaL}}\\, m(t)^p\\, h(t)\\, f_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)\\, (V_{\\mathrm{step}} - E_{\\mathrm{Ca}})$, where $V_{\\mathrm{step}}$ is the clamp step voltage.

The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\nThe state of the system is described by four time-dependent variables: the activation gate $m(t)$, the voltage-dependent inactivation gate $h(t)$, the calcium-dependent inactivated fraction $b(t)$, and the submembrane calcium concentration $\\mathrm{Ca}(t)$. The membrane voltage $V(t)$ is externally controlled via a voltage-clamp protocol.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Differential Equations**\n\n**A. Voltage-Dependent Gating Dynamics:**\nThe dynamics of the voltage-dependent gates, activation ($m$) and inactivation ($h$), are described by first-order linear ordinary differential equations. For a generic gating variable $x$, the rate of change is given by the transition between the closed ($1-x$) and open ($x$) states, governed by voltage-dependent rate constants $\\alpha_x(V)$ and $\\beta_x(V)$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha_x(V)(1-x) - \\beta_x(V)x $$\nThis is commonly reformulated using the steady-state value $x_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{\\alpha_x(V)}{\\alpha_x(V) + \\beta_x(V)}$ and the time constant $\\tau_x(V) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_x(V) + \\beta_x(V)}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{x_{\\infty}(V) - x}{\\tau_x(V)} $$\nThe problem provides the steady-state functions and time constants directly.\n\nFor the activation gate $m$:\n$$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = \\frac{m_{\\infty}(V) - m}{\\tau_m} $$\nwhere $m_{\\infty}(V)$ is a logistic function representing the steady-state activation:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\left(1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V - V_{m,1/2}}{k_m}\\right)\\right)^{-1} $$\nThe time constant $\\tau_m$ is given as a constant value.\n\nFor the voltage-dependent inactivation gate $h$:\n$$ \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{h_{\\infty}(V) - h}{\\tau_h} $$\nwhere $h_{\\infty}(V)$ is a logistic function for steady-state inactivation:\n$$ h_{\\infty}(V) = \\left(1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{V - V_{h,1/2}}{k_h}\\right)\\right)^{-1} $$\nThe time constant $\\tau_h$ is also given as a constant.\n\n**B. Calcium-Dependent Inactivation (CDI) Dynamics:**\nCalcium-dependent inactivation is modeled as the binding of calcium ions to an inactivation site on the channel. The fraction of channels in the bound, inactivated state is denoted by $b$. The corresponding available (unbound) fraction is $f_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = 1-b$. The binding reaction is:\n$$ \\text{Site}_\\text{unbound} + \\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Site}_\\text{bound} $$\nThe reaction kinetics are described by mass action, with an on-rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and an off-rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The rate of change of the bound fraction $b$ is:\n$$ \\frac{db}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[\\mathrm{Ca}](1-b) - k_{\\mathrm{off}}b $$\nHere, $[\\mathrm{Ca}]$ is the submembrane calcium concentration, $\\mathrm{Ca}(t)$. The off-rate is defined via the dissociation constant, $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = K_d k_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n\n**C. Submembrane Calcium Concentration Dynamics:**\nThe submembrane calcium concentration changes due to influx through the L-type channels and a first-order removal process.\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of change from influx}) + (\\text{rate of change from removal}) $$\nThe ionic current $I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}$ (in Amperes, C/s) is converted to a molar flux (mol/s) by dividing by the Faraday constant $F$ and the ion valence $z$. An inward current of positive ions is negative by convention and increases the intracellular concentration. Thus, the molar influx is $-\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}}{zF}$. The rate of change in concentration is this flux divided by the submembrane volume $V_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ (in liters).\nThe removal term describes a first-order relaxation to the resting calcium concentration $\\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ with time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$. This term is $-\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}] - \\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}$.\nFinally, an effective buffering factor $\\gamma_B$ scales the net rate of change of free calcium, reflecting rapid binding to intracellular buffers. The problem states this is applied to the entire right-hand side. The complete ODE is:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}]}{dt} = \\gamma_B \\left( -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}}{z F V_{\\mathrm{ss}}} - \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}] - \\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}} \\right) $$\n\n**D. L-Type Calcium Current Equation:**\nThe current $I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}$ is an algebraic output of the system, defined in the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism as the product of the maximal conductance ($g_{\\mathrm{CaL}}$), the gating variables, and the driving force ($V - E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$):\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}(t) = g_{\\mathrm{CaL}} \\, m(t)^p \\, h(t) \\, f_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t) \\, (V(t) - E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}) $$\nSubstituting $f_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t) = 1 - b(t)$ gives:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}(t) = g_{\\mathrm{CaL}} \\, m(t)^p \\, h(t) \\, (1-b(t)) \\, (V(t) - E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}) $$\nThis expression for $I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}$ is substituted into the ODE for $\\mathrm{Ca}(t)$, creating a fully coupled system.\n\n**2. Numerical Simulation Strategy**\n\nThe system of four coupled, non-linear ordinary differential equations is solved numerically.\n\n**A. Initialization:**\nAt time $t  0$, the system is in steady state at the holding potential $V_{\\mathrm{hold}}$ and resting calcium $\\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{rest}}$. The initial conditions for the simulation at $t=0$ are obtained by setting the time derivatives to zero:\n- $m(0) = m_{\\infty}(V_{\\mathrm{hold}})$\n- $h(0) = h_{\\infty}(V_{\\mathrm{hold}})$\n- $\\mathrm{Ca}(0) = \\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{rest}}$\n- $b(0) = b_{\\infty}(\\mathrm{Ca}_{\\mathrm{rest}})$, where the steady-state bound fraction is derived from $\\frac{db}{dt}=0$:\n  $$ b_{\\infty}(\\mathrm{Ca}) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\mathrm{Ca}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\mathrm{Ca} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} $$\n\n**B. Integration:**\nAt $t=0$, the voltage is stepped to $V_{\\mathrm{step}}$. The system of ODEs is then integrated forward in time from $t=0$ to the specified duration $T$. A robust adaptive step-size solver, such as a Runge-Kutta method (e.g., RK45), is appropriate. We use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` for this task, with appropriately small error tolerances to ensure the required numerical precision.\n\n**C. Output Calculation:**\nOnce the simulation is complete, the solution trajectories for $m(t)$, $h(t)$, $b(t)$, and $\\mathrm{Ca}(t)$ are obtained over the interval $[0, T]$. The current $I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}(t)$ is then calculated for all time points. The required outputs are:\n1. The minimum value of the current during the step: $\\min_{t \\in [0, T]} I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}(t)$.\n2. The terminal value of the current at the end of the step: $I_{\\mathrm{CaL}}(T)$.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for each test case defined in the problem.

It presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of calcium dynamics in a cardiac dyad, using established principles of mass conservation and receptor kinetics. All necessary parameters are provided, and the scenario is physiologically relevant. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is determined in two parts: first, the change in peak free calcium concentration, and second, the resulting change in the ryanodine receptor (RyR) open probability.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the fold-change in peak free calcium concentration, $c_{1}/c_{0}$.\n\nThe problem states that a fixed total amount of calcium, let's denote this by the number of moles $n_{\\text{Ca}}$, is injected into the dyadic cleft. This quantity is constant. The geometry of the cleft is a slab with constant apposed area $A$ and variable width $w$. The volume of this cleft is $V = A w$.\n\nUpon injection, these calcium ions are distributed throughout the volume $V$. The total concentration of added calcium, $C_{\\text{total}}$, is given by the ratio of the moles of calcium to the volume:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca}}}{V} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca}}}{A w}$$\nThe problem states that the free calcium concentration, $c$, is linearly reduced by a constant buffer capacity factor $\\beta$. This implies that the free concentration is directly proportional to the total concentration of added calcium. The constant of proportionality, which we will call $k$, depends on the unchanged buffering properties of the system.\n$$c = k \\cdot C_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\text{total}}$, we obtain the relationship between the free calcium concentration $c$ and the cleft width $w$:\n$$c = k \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca}}}{A w}$$\nThe quantities $k$, $n_{\\text{Ca}}$, and $A$ are all constant between the baseline and pathological conditions. We can therefore group them into a single constant, $K = k n_{\\text{Ca}} / A$, which gives the simplified relationship:\n$$c = \\frac{K}{w}$$\nThis shows that the peak free calcium concentration is inversely proportional to the cleft width.\n\nWe can now write this relationship for the baseline state (subscript $0$) and the pathologically remodeled state (subscript $1$):\n$$c_{0} = \\frac{K}{w_{0}}$$\n$$c_{1} = \\frac{K}{w_{1}}$$\nThe fold-change in concentration is the ratio $c_{1}/c_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{0}} = \\frac{K/w_{1}}{K/w_{0}} = \\frac{w_{0}}{w_{1}}$$\nThe problem states that the cleft width increases by $20\\%$, meaning $w_{1} = w_{0} + 0.2 w_{0} = 1.2 w_{0}$. Substituting this into our expression for the fold-change:\n$$\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{0}} = \\frac{w_{0}}{1.2 w_{0}} = \\frac{1}{1.2} = \\frac{1}{6/5} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nThus, the first required quantity is $\\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nPart 2: Determination of the fold-change in RyR open probability, $P_{\\mathrm{open},1}/P_{\\mathrm{open},0}$.\n\nThe RyR channel requires two calcium ions to bind at two identical, independent activation sites. The open probability, $P_{\\text{open}}$, is the probability that both sites are occupied. If $P_{\\text{site}}$ is the probability that a single site is occupied, the independence of the sites implies:\n$$P_{\\text{open}} = (P_{\\text{site}})^{2}$$\nThe probability $P_{\\text{site}}$ is determined by the law of mass action for the binding equilibrium: $\\text{Site} + \\text{Ca}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Site-Ca}^{2+}$. The equilibrium dissociation constant is given as $K_{d}$. The probability of a site being occupied by calcium (concentration $c$) is given by the standard fractional occupancy formula (a Hill equation with coefficient $1$):\n$$P_{\\text{site}} = \\frac{c}{c + K_{d}}$$\nTherefore, the RyR open probability as a function of free calcium concentration is:\n$$P_{\\text{open}}(c) = \\left(\\frac{c}{c + K_{d}}\\right)^{2}$$\nWe are given the baseline concentration $c_{0} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The open probability at baseline is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{open},0} = \\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{c_{0} + K_{d}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{20}{20 + 10}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{20}{30}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{4}{9}$$\nNext, we calculate the concentration in the remodeled state, $c_{1}$:\n$$c_{1} = \\frac{5}{6} c_{0} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = \\frac{100}{6}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = \\frac{50}{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nNow, we calculate the open probability in the remodeled state, $P_{\\mathrm{open},1}$, using this new concentration $c_{1}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{open},1} = \\left(\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{1} + K_{d}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{50/3}{50/3 + 10}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{50/3}{50/3 + 30/3}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{50/3}{80/3}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{50}{80}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{25}{64}$$\nFinally, we compute the required fold-change in open probability, $P_{\\mathrm{open},1}/P_{\\mathrm{open},0}$:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{open},1}}{P_{\\mathrm{open},0}} = \\frac{25/64}{4/9} = \\frac{25}{64} \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{225}{256}$$\nThis is the second required quantity.\n\nTo provide the final answer, we convert these exact fractions to decimal values rounded to four significant figures.\nFold-change in concentration: $\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{0}} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833333... \\approx 0.8333$.\nFold-change in open probability: $\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{open},1}}{P_{\\mathrm{open},0}} = \\frac{225}{256} = 0.87890625 \\approx 0.8789$.\n\nThe two fold-changes are reported as a dimensionless row vector.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8333  0.8789 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2567119"}, {"introduction": "The final step of excitation-contraction coupling is the transduction of the cytosolic Ca²⁺ transient into mechanical force via Ca²⁺ binding to the myofilament protein Troponin C (TnC).

The force–$p\\mathrm{Ca}$ relationship is sigmoidal, and its midpoint and steepness are summarized by two empirical parameters: the effective concentration for half-maximal force (EC50) and the Hill coefficient. Here, EC50 is defined as the free calcium ion concentration at which steady force equals one half of its maximal value, and the Hill coefficient is the effective slope factor at the midpoint.\n\nConsider the regulatory calcium ion binding to Troponin C (TnC) on the thin filament. Use the following fundamental base:\n- Calcium ion binding to the regulatory site obeys the law of mass action, with dissociation constant $K_{d}$, such that the fractional occupancy is $\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] + K_{d}}$ for a single binding site.\n- Macroscopic steady force is a monotonically increasing, saturating function of the regulatory occupancy $\\theta$, with steepness governed by a cooperative coupling along the thin filament that is characterized by an effective Hill coefficient $n_{0}$ in the wild type. The mutation considered below does not alter this cooperative coupling architecture (that is, it does not change $n_{0}$).\n- Assume that half-maximal force coincides with half-occupancy of the regulatory site, so that EC50 is set by the calcium ion concentration that yields $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nA point mutation in TnC halves the affinity of its regulatory site for calcium ions without otherwise affecting thin filament cooperativity.

It presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of muscle activation that is free of contradictions or factual unsoundness. We may therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation of the solution from the specified fundamental principles.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of two quantities: the shift in the midpoint of the force-$p\\mathrm{Ca}$ curve, $\\Delta p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}$, and the Hill coefficient of the mutated protein, $n_{H}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the shift in the midpoint, $\\Delta p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}$. The problem states that the midpoint of the force curve, where force is half-maximal, corresponds to the calcium concentration at which the fractional occupancy of the regulatory site on Troponin C, $\\theta$, is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$. The fractional occupancy for a single binding site is given by the law of mass action:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] + K_{d}}\n$$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ is the free calcium ion concentration and $K_{d}$ is the dissociation constant.\n\nThe calcium concentration for half-maximal activation, denoted $\\mathrm{EC50}$, is, by the problem's assumption, the concentration at which $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$. We set $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ in the equation above and solve for the corresponding concentration, which we denote $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50} + K_{d}}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $2 \\cdot ([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50} + K_{d})$ yields:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50} + K_{d} = 2 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}\n$$\nSolving for $K_{d}$ gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nK_{d} = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that, under the given assumptions, the $\\mathrm{EC50}$ is numerically equal to the dissociation constant.\n\nThis relationship holds for both the wild-type (WT) and mutant (mut) forms:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = K_{d}^{\\mathrm{mut}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the mutation halves the affinity, which corresponds to a doubling of the dissociation constant:\n$$\nK_{d}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = 2 K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equations for $\\mathrm{EC50}$ gives:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = 2 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the shift on the $p\\mathrm{Ca}$ axis, where $p\\mathrm{Ca} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}])$. We can write the midpoints $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$:\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}})\n$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship between the mutant and wild-type $\\mathrm{EC50}$ values into the equation for $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$:\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = -\\log_{10}(2 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$, we get:\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = -(\\log_{10}(2) + \\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}))\n$$\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = -\\log_{10}(2) - \\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\nRecognizing that $-\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}})$ is equal to $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, we have:\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - \\log_{10}(2)\n$$\nThe required shift, $\\Delta p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}$, is defined as $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50} = (p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - \\log_{10}(2)) - p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = -\\log_{10}(2)\n$$\nThis is the first part of the answer. A decrease in calcium affinity (increase in $K_d$) leads to a rightward shift of the force-calcium curve, which corresponds to a decrease on the $p\\mathrm{Ca}$ scale (since $p\\mathrm{Ca}$ is a negative logarithm).\n\nSecond, we determine the mutated Hill coefficient, $n_{H}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$. The problem statement provides a clear separation between the factors determining the curve's position (sensitivity) and its steepness (cooperativity). The macroscopic steepness of the sigmoidal force–$p\\mathrm{Ca}$ curve is quantified by the Hill coefficient, $n_{H}$. The problem states that this steepness is governed by the \"cooperative coupling along the thin filament that is characterized by an effective Hill coefficient $n_{0}$ in the wild type.\" Crucially, it is also stated that \"The mutation considered below does not alter this cooperative coupling architecture (that is, it does not change $n_{0}$).\"\n\nThis implies that the intrinsic cooperativity of the system, which gives rise to the steep sigmoidal response, is an independent parameter that is unaffected by the mutation to the calcium binding site. The Hill coefficient of the force-response curve, $n_H$, is the macroscopic manifestation of this underlying cooperativity, which is parameterized by $n_0$. Therefore, the Hill coefficient for the wild-type is $n_{H}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = n_{0}$. Since the mutation does not affect the cooperative mechanism, the Hill coefficient for the mutant must be the same as for the wild-type.\n$$\nn_{H}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = n_{H}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = n_{0}\n$$\nThe mutation shifts the position of the curve without altering its shape or steepness. Therefore, the mutated Hill coefficient, expressed in terms of the wild-type value $n_0$, is simply $n_0$.\n\nCombining the results, the additive shift in the midpoint is $-\\log_{10}(2)$ and the mutated Hill coefficient is $n_0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\log_{10}(2)  n_{0} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2567167"}]}
