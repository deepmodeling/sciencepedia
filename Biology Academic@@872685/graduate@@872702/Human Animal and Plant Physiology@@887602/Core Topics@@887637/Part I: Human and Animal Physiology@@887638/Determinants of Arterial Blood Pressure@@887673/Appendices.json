The model is an elementary application of fluid dynamics principles, analogous to a simple direct-current electrical circuit.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing steady, incompressible flow through a resistive element is that the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is directly proportional to the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, across the element and inversely proportional to the resistance, $R$. This is expressed as:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$$\nor, rearranged, as:\n$$\\Delta P = Q \\times R$$\nIn the context of the systemic circulation, the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is the Cardiac Output, denoted as $\\text{CO}$. The total resistance of the systemic circuit is the Systemic Vascular Resistance, $\\text{SVR}$. The pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the mean pressure at the inlet of the systemic circuit, which is the Mean Arterial Pressure ($\\text{MAP}$), and the mean pressure at the outlet, which is the Central Venous Pressure ($\\text{CVP}$).\n\nThus, the governing equation for this system is:\n$$\\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP} = \\text{CO} \\times \\text{SVR}$$\nThis is the first principle from which we must work.

The analysis must be grounded in the principles specified: conservation of mass and the hydrodynamic analog of Ohm's law.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship for venous return ($\\text{VR}$). Venous return is the flow of blood from the systemic circulation back to the right atrium. According to the hydrodynamic analog of Ohm's law, flow is equal to the pressure gradient divided by the resistance. The driving pressure for venous return is the difference between the Mean Systemic Filling Pressure ($P_{\\text{msf}}$), which represents the mean pressure in the systemic circulation if the heart were stopped, and the Right Atrial Pressure ($\\text{RAP}$), which is the pressure at the inlet of the heart. The resistance to this flow is the lumped venous resistance, $R_v$. Therefore, the equation for venous return is:\n$$\\text{VR} = \\frac{P_{\\text{msf}} - \\text{RAP}}{R_v}$$\n\nSecond, we apply the principle of conservation of mass for a closed-loop system at steady state.
