The assumptions, such as the one-dimensional approximation for a thin shell and constant diffusivity, are standard and reasonable for a leading-order analysis. All necessary information is provided. We shall therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires solving the diffusion equation subject to the specified boundary conditions. The standard method for this is separation of variables. We postulate a solution of the form $C(y,t) = Y(y)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE yields:\n$$Y(y)\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = D T(t)\\frac{d^2Y(y)}{dy^2}$$\nSeparating the variables, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{1}{D T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^2Y(y)}{dy^2} = -k^2$$\nHere, $-k^2$ is the separation constant. The negative sign is chosen because we expect the concentration profile to decay in time towards a steady state, not grow infinitely. This separation yields two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$1.$ The temporal ODE: $\\frac{dT}{dt} = -Dk^2 T$. The solution is $T(t) = A \\exp(-Dk^2 t)$, where $A$ is a constant.\n$2.$ The spatial ODE: $\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} + k^2 Y = 0$.\n\nWe must now solve the spatial ODE subject to the boundary conditions $\\frac{dY}{dy}(0) = 0$ and $\\frac{dY}{dy}(L) = 0$. The general solution to the spatial ODE is $Y(y) = B\\cos(ky) + F\\sin(ky)$. Its derivative is $\\frac{dY}{dy} = -kB\\sin(ky) + kF\\cos(ky)$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition at $y=0$:\n$$\\frac{dY}{dy}(0) = -kB\\sin(0) + kF\\cos(0) = kF = 0$$\nFor non-trivial solutions where $k \\neq 0$, we must have $F=0$. Thus, the solution form is restricted to $Y(y) = B\\cos(ky)$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition at $y=L$:\n$$\\frac{dY}{dy}(L) = -kB\\sin(kL) = 0$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $B \\neq 0$ and $k \\neq 0$. This forces the condition $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This equality is satisfied when the argument of the sine function is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. Therefore, the allowed values for $k$, the eigenvalues, are given by:\n$$k_n L = n\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$$\n$$k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$$\nThe case $n=0$ corresponds to $k_0 = 0$. For $k=0$, the spatial ODE becomes $\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} = 0$, with solution $Y(y) = c_1 y + c_2$. The boundary conditions $\\frac{dY}{dy}=c_1=0$ imply that $Y_0(y) = c_2$, a constant. This is the non-decaying, steady-state mode, representing the final uniform concentration distribution after infinite time. Total enzyme is conserved due to the no-flux boundaries.\n\nThe general solution for the concentration is a superposition of all these modes:\n$$C(y,t) = C_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-D\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right)$$\nEach mode $n$ decays exponentially with a rate given by $\\lambda_n = D k_n^2 = D\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$. The homogenization of the concentration is governed by the decay of these modes. The slowest-decaying mode is the one that persists the longest, thus setting the overall timescale for the process. This corresponds to the smallest non-zero decay rate, which occurs for the mode with the smallest non-zero $n$, i.e., $n=1$.\n\nThe decay rate of the slowest-decaying mode is:\n$$\\lambda_1 = D\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$$\nThe problem defines the characteristic homogenization timescale, which we denote by $\\tau$, as the inverse of this slowest decay rate:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{1}{D\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2} = \\frac{L^2}{\\pi^2 D}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the characteristic timescale.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression numerically.

The exponent $\\alpha$ is positive ($\\alpha > 0$) because the surface area $A(g)$ of the villous membrane must increase as the fetus grows to accommodate its increasing metabolic needs. The exponent $\\beta$ is positive ($\\beta > 0$) because the diffusion barrier thickness $\\Delta x(g)$ must decrease during gestation to improve transport efficiency. A decreasing function of $g$ of the form $g^{\\gamma}$ requires a negative exponent $\\gamma$. In our case, the exponent is $-\\beta$, so for it to be negative, we must have $\\beta > 0$.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, we analyze the units. Let $[X]$ denote the dimensions of a quantity $X$. The term $\\frac{g}{g_{0}}$ is dimensionless. The exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are dimensionless. Therefore, the dimensions of $J(g)$ are determined by the prefactor. From the initial equation $J = K \\frac{A}{\\Delta x} \\Delta P$, we determine the dimensions of the permeability constant $K$: $[K] = \\frac{[J][\\Delta x]}{[A][\\Delta P]}$. If $[J]$ is moles/time ($\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{T}^{-1}$), $[A]$ is area ($\\text{L}^2$), $[\\Delta x]$ is length ($\\text{L}$), and $[\\Delta P]$ is pressure ($\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{T}^{-2}$), then $[K] = \\frac{(\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{T}^{-1}) \\cdot \\text{L}}{\\text{L}^2 \\cdot (\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{T}^{-2})} = \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{T} \\cdot \\text{M}^{-1}$.\nNow we check the derived expression for $J(g)$.

This operation is valid because the problem states $\\alpha+\\beta \\neq \\eta$, which ensures the exponent's denominator is non-zero.\n$$\\frac{g^{\\ast}}{g_{0}} = \\left( \\frac{D_{0} \\Delta x_{0}}{K A_{0} \\Delta P} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta-\\eta}}$$\nFinally, we obtain the expression for $g^{\\ast}$:\n$$g^{\\ast} = g_{0} \\left( \\frac{D_{0} \\Delta x_{0}}{K A_{0} \\Delta P} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta-\\eta}}$$\nFor a unique solution $g^{\\ast} > g_{0}$ to exist, certain conditions on the parameters are required. The base of the exponentiation, $\\frac{D_{0} \\Delta x_{0}}{K A_{0} \\Delta P}$, must be positive, which is true as all parameters represent physical quantities that must be positive.\nThe condition $g^{\\ast} > g_{0}$ implies $\\frac{g^{\\ast}}{g_{0}} > 1$. Let the constant ratio of reference demand to reference supply be $C = \\frac{D_{0}}{J(g_0)} = \\frac{D_{0} \\Delta x_{0}}{K A_{0} \\Delta P}$. The inequality is $C^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta-\\eta}} > 1$.\nThis leads to two cases:\n1. If $\\alpha+\\beta > \\eta$, the supply exponent is greater than the demand exponent. For the inequality to hold, the base must be greater than $1$: $C > 1$. This means $D_{0} > J(g_0)$, so demand at the reference time $g_0$ exceeds supply. Since supply grows faster, it will meet and surpass demand at a future time $g^{\\ast} > g_0$.\n2. If $\\alpha+\\beta < \\eta$, the demand exponent is greater. For the inequality to hold with a negative exponent, the base must be between $0$ and $1$: $0 < C < 1$. This means $D_{0} < J(g_0)$, so supply at $g_0$ exceeds demand. Since demand grows faster, it will catch up to supply at a future time $g^{\\ast} > g_0$.\nSince the functions are monotonic power laws and their exponents differ, they can intersect at most once for $g > 0$, ensuring the solution is unique when it exists.\n\n**Task 3: Reporting the Final Expression**\n\nThe required final answer is the derived analytic expression for $g^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{g_{0} \\left( \\frac{D_{0} \\Delta x_{0}}{K A_{0} \\Delta P} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta-\\eta}}}$$", "id": "2568327"}, {"introduction": "The onset of labor is marked by the dramatic emergence of powerful, coordinated uterine contractions from previously disorganized activity.

It presents a simplified but valid biophysical model of myometrial cell synchronization based on the established principles of coupled oscillators. All parameters and conditions are clearly defined, permitting a rigorous and unambiguous derivation. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimum external drive amplitude, denoted as $S_c$, required to achieve complete phase-locking of a network of $N$ oscillators. Complete phase-locking, or full synchronization, signifies that all oscillators adopt the frequency $\\Omega$ of the external drive.\n\nThe fundamental condition for an individual oscillator $i$ to be phase-locked to the combined influence of the external drive and the network's mean field is given in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\lvert \\omega_i - \\Omega \\rvert \\leq K_{\\text{eff}} r + S\n$$\nHere, $\\lvert \\omega_i - \\Omega \\rvert$ is the intrinsic frequency detuning of oscillator $i$ from the drive frequency $\\Omega$. The term $K_{\\text{eff}} r + S$ represents the total effective driving amplitude, comprising the mean-field coupling contribution $K_{\\text{eff}} r$ and the external stimulus amplitude $S$. The parameter $r \\in [0, 1]$ is the Kuramoto order parameter, which quantifies the macroscopic coherence of the oscillator population.\n\nFor the entire population to be phase-locked, this condition must hold for every oscillator $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. Consequently, the condition must be satisfied even for the oscillator(s) that are most difficult to entrain. These are the oscillators with the largest magnitude of frequency detuning. The natural frequencies $\\{\\omega_i\\}$ are uniformly distributed over the interval $[\\Omega - \\Delta, \\Omega + \\Delta]$. The maximum possible detuning is therefore:\n$$\n\\max_i \\lvert \\omega_i - \\Omega \\rvert = \\Delta\n$$\nThis maximum is realized by oscillators at the edges of the frequency distribution, with $\\omega_i = \\Omega \\pm \\Delta$.\n\nTo guarantee complete phase-locking of the entire population, the total driving strength must be sufficient to overcome this maximum detuning. This imposes a global condition on the system parameters:\n$$\n\\Delta \\leq K_{\\text{eff}} r + S\n$$\nThe critical stimulus amplitude, $S_c$, is the minimum value of $S$ for which this inequality is satisfied. The threshold condition is met at equality:\n$$\n\\Delta = K_{\\text{eff}} r + S_c\n$$\nFrom this, we can express $S_c$ as:\n$$\nS_c = \\Delta - K_{\\text{eff}} r\n$$\nThe problem requires us to evaluate this expression under the assumption that at the onset of \"fully coordinated contractions\"—which is synonymous with complete phase-locking—the macroscopic coherence is at its locked value. In a fully synchronized state, all oscillators share a common frequency and maintain fixed phase differences. This corresponds to a state of maximum possible coherence, for which the Kuramoto order parameter is $r=1$. Substituting $r=1$ into the expression for $S_c$ yields:\n$$\nS_c = \\Delta - K_{\\text{eff}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the definition of the mean-field effective coupling amplitude as $K_{\\text{eff}} = \\kappa \\rho z$. Substituting this into our expression for $S_c$ gives the explicit dependency on the problem parameters:\n$$\nS_c = \\Delta - \\kappa \\rho z\n$$\nFinally, we must recognize that a stimulus amplitude $S$ is a physical quantity and cannot be negative, so $S_c \\geq 0$. If the internal coupling $K_{\\text{eff}}$ is already strong enough to ensure synchronization (i.e., if $K_{\\text{eff}} \\geq \\Delta$), the required external stimulus is zero. Therefore, the minimal non-negative amplitude $S_c$ is correctly given by:\n$$\nS_c = \\max(0, \\Delta - \\kappa \\rho z)\n$$\nThis is the final derived expression for the minimal external drive amplitude required to guarantee complete phase-locking. We will now use this formula to compute the results for the given test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the minimal external drive amplitude Sc for complete phase-locking\n    of myometrial cell oscillators for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (Delta, kappa, rho, z)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.30, 0.10, 0.50, 4),  # Case 1\n        (0.45, 0.05, 0.00, 6),  # Case 2\n        (0.50, 0.20, 1.00, 4),  # Case 3\n        (0.40, 0.10, 1.00, 4),  # Case 4\n        (0.12, 0.08, 0.60, 2),  # Case 5\n        (0.70, 0.05, 0.90, 8),  # Case 6\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        delta, kappa, rho, z = case\n\n        # Calculate the mean-field effective coupling amplitude.\n        # K_eff = kappa * rho * z\n        k_eff = kappa * rho * z\n\n        # Calculate the critical stimulus amplitude Sc using the derived formula:\n        # Sc = max(0, Delta - K_eff)\n        # The amplitude must be non-negative.\n        s_c = max(0.0, delta - k_eff)\n\n        # Round the result to 4 decimal places as required.\n        rounded_s_c = round(s_c, 4)\n        results.append(rounded_s_c)\n\n    # Format the results into a single comma-separated string within brackets.\n    # The map(str, ...) ensures each number is converted to its string representation.\n    output_string = f\"[{','.join(map(str, ['{:.4f}'.format(r) for r in results]))}]\"\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(output_string)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2568357"}]}
