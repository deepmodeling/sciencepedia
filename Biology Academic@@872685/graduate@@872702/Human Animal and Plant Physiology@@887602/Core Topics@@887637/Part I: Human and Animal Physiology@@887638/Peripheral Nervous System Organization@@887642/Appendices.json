It is scientifically grounded in established principles of neurophysiology, is well-posed, and uses objective, formal language. We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: first, a theoretical motivation for the linear scaling of conduction velocity with fiber diameter; second, the determination of a reasonable proportionality constant from empirical data; and third, the calculation of the conduction velocity for a specific axon.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the linear relationship $v \\approx k d$.\n\nThe conduction velocity, $v$, of an action potential along a myelinated axon is determined by the speed of saltatory conduction, where the signal propagates from one node of Ranvier to the next. The velocity can be defined as the internodal length, $L$, divided by the total time, $\\tau_{total}$, required to traverse this distance.\n$$v = \\frac{L}{\\tau_{total}}$$\nThe total time, $\\tau_{total}$, is the sum of two components: the time required for the electrotonic passive spread of the potential along the myelinated internode, $\\tau_i$, and the time required to depolarize the membrane at the next node of Ranvier to its threshold potential, known as the nodal delay, $\\tau_n$.\n$$\\tau_{total} = \\tau_i + \\tau_n$$\nFor myelinated axons, the internodal axoplasm has low electrical resistance and the myelin sheath provides high insulation (low capacitance), allowing for very rapid electrotonic spread of the action current. In contrast, the nodal delay involves the time-consuming process of opening voltage-gated ion channels. Consequently, the internodal conduction time is negligible compared to the nodal delay, especially in large-diameter fibers at physiological temperature ($37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n$$\\tau_i \\ll \\tau_n$$\nTherefore, the total time can be approximated by the nodal delay alone:\n$$\\tau_{total} \\approx \\tau_n$$\nThe problem states as a premise that for the fibers in question, this nodal delay, $\\tau_n$, is approximately size-invariant, meaning it can be treated as a constant.\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the velocity equation gives:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{L}{\\tau_n}$$\nThe second fundamental principle provided is that the internodal length, $L$, is approximately proportional to the outer fiber diameter, $d$. This is a well-established finding from both theoretical models (e.g., Rushton's analysis) and morphological studies, which show that an optimal ratio of internodal length to diameter maximizes conduction velocity. We can express this proportionality as:\n$$L = c \\cdot d$$\nwhere $c$ is a dimensionless constant of proportionality, empirically found to be in the range of $100-150$ for optimal conduction.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $L$ into our velocity approximation yields:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{c \\cdot d}{\\tau_n}$$\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n$$v \\approx \\left(\\frac{c}{\\tau_n}\\right) d$$\nSince both $c$ and $\\tau_n$ are considered constants under the given conditions (specific fiber type, temperature, and species), their ratio is also a constant. Let us define a new physical constant $K_{phys} = c/\\tau_n$. The units of $K_{phys}$ would be inverse seconds ($s^{-1}$), assuming $d$ is in meters and $v$ in meters per second. The relationship is thus demonstrated to be linear: $v=K_{phys} \\cdot d$.\n\nThe problem uses a conventional mixed-unit formulation, $v \\approx k d$, where $v$ is in units of $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $d$ is in units of $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The constant $k$ absorbs the necessary unit conversion factor of $10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m/\\mu m}$. The linear dependence of $v$ on $d$ is the essential physical result, and the form $v \\approx kd$ is a practical empirical representation of this linearity.\n\nPart 2: Justification and estimation of the constant $k$.\n\nThe numerical value of the proportionality constant $k$ for mammalian myelinated peripheral nerves has been the subject of extensive experimental investigation since the work of Erlanger and Gasser. For large A-alpha (A$\\alpha$) motor fibers at a physiological temperature of $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, a widely cited empirical rule, sometimes known as Hursh's factor, states that the conduction velocity in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ is approximately $6$ times the fiber diameter in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. This corresponds to a value of $k \\approx 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}$.\n\nMore specific studies confirm values in this vicinity. For instance, Boyd & Kalu ($1979$, J. Physiol.) reported a factor of $5.7 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}$ for cat $\\alpha$-motor efferents. Other research on various mammalian species places the value for the largest, fastest-conducting motor fibers in a range. A physiologically reasonable range for $k$, encompassing these well-tested findings, is from $k_{min} = 5.5 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}$ to $k_{max} = 6.5 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the selection of the midpoint of this range as the best estimate, $\\bar{k}$.\n$$\\bar{k} = \\frac{k_{min} + k_{max}}{2} = \\frac{5.5 + 6.5}{2} \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = \\frac{12.0}{2} \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}$$\n$$\\bar{k} = 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}$$\nThis value will be used for the final calculation.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of conduction velocity.\n\nWe are given an A$\\alpha$ motor axon with an outer fiber diameter $d = 12 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We will use our estimated constant $\\bar{k} = 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}$ to calculate the conduction velocity $v$.\n$$v = \\bar{k} \\cdot d$$\n$$v = (6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}}) \\cdot (12 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$v = 72 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to three significant figures.

Each presynaptic action potential engages a set of anatomically defined release sites, with the number of functionally available sites denoted by $n$, and the per-site release probability for acetylcholine (ACh) denoted by $p$. The mean quantal content is $m = n p$. Each quantum produces a postsynaptic endplate depolarization of amplitude $q$ (the quantal size), assumed constant across quanta and fibers. Across identical stimuli, release is modeled as a Poisson process, so that the number of released quanta has mean $m$ and variance $m$. For a given stimulus, the endplate potential amplitude is the sum over released quanta and, for large $m$, its distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian with mean $\\mu = m q$ and variance $\\sigma^{2} = m q^{2}$. A postsynaptic muscle fiber generates an action potential if and only if its endplate potential exceeds a fixed threshold $V_{\\mathrm{thr}}$.
