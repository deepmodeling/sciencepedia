It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical thermodynamics as applied to ion channel biophysics, is well-posed with sufficient data to determine the unknown parameters, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: first, the derivation of the steady-state activation function $m_{\\infty}(V)$; second, the calculation of the half-activation voltage $V_{1/2}$ and the slope factor $k$; and third, the determination of the effective gating charge $z$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Activation Function\n\nWe begin with the premise of a two-state equilibrium between a closed ($C$) and an open ($O$) conformation of the channel's voltage sensor:\n$$ C \\rightleftharpoons O $$\nThe equilibrium constant for this transition, $K_{eq}$, is the ratio of the concentration of open states to closed states:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\frac{[O]}{[C]} $$\nFrom statistical mechanics, the equilibrium constant is related to the change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem states that the free energy difference is voltage-dependent:\n$$ \\Delta G(V) = \\Delta G_{0} - z F V $$\nHere, $\\Delta G_{0}$ is the intrinsic free energy difference at zero membrane potential ($V=0$), $z$ is the effective gating charge, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nThe steady-state activation fraction, $m_{\\infty}(V)$, is equivalent to the probability of finding the channel in the open state, $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(V)$. This probability is the fraction of channels in the open state relative to the total number of channels:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = P_{\\mathrm{O}}(V) = \\frac{[O]}{[C] + [O]} $$\nTo express this in terms of $K_{eq}$, we divide the numerator and denominator by $[C]$:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{[O]/[C]}{[C]/[C] + [O]/[C]} = \\frac{K_{eq}}{1 + K_{eq}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_{eq}$:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\Delta G(V) / (RT))}{1 + \\exp(-\\Delta G(V) / (RT))} $$\nThis can be rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(+\\Delta G(V) / (RT))$:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(+\\Delta G(V) / (RT)) + 1} $$\nNow, we substitute the given expression for $\\Delta G(V)$:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - zFV}{RT}\\right)} $$\nTo match this to the canonical logistic (Boltzmann) form $m_{\\infty}(V) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\exp((V_{1/2} - V)/k)}$, we equate the exponents:\n$$ \\frac{V_{1/2} - V}{k} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - zFV}{RT} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT} - \\frac{zF}{RT}V $$\nBy comparing the coefficients of $V$ and the constant terms, we can identify $V_{1/2}$ and $k$.\nComparing the terms dependent on $V$:\n$$ -\\frac{V}{k} = -\\frac{zF}{RT}V \\implies k = \\frac{RT}{zF} $$\nComparing the constant terms:\n$$ \\frac{V_{1/2}}{k} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT} \\implies V_{1/2} = k \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$ into the expression for $V_{1/2}$:\n$$ V_{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{RT}{zF}\\right) \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{zF} $$\nThe half-activation voltage, $V_{1/2}$, is the voltage at which $m_{\\infty}(V_{1/2}) = 0.5$. At this voltage, the exponent in the Boltzmann function must be zero, which means $\\Delta G(V_{1/2}) = 0$. Thus, $\\Delta G_0 - zFV_{1/2} = 0$, which confirms that $V_{1/2} = \\Delta G_0 / (zF)$.

Derivation of the Reversal Potential ($E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$)**\nThe reversal potential for a channel permeable to multiple ion species is described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i}^{\\text{cations}} P_i [C_i]_o + \\sum_{j}^{\\text{anions}} P_j [A_j]_i}{\\sum_{i}^{\\text{cations}} P_i [C_i]_i + \\sum_{j}^{\\text{anions}} P_j [A_j]_o} \\right) $$\nwhere $P_i$ is the permeability of ion $i$, and $[...]_o$ and $[...]_i$ are the extracellular and intracellular concentrations, respectively. The problem states that the channel is permeable only to $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and impermeable to $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and other ions.

The current balance equation is:\n$$g_{S} v_{S} + g_{C}(v_{S} - v_{D}) = I_{\\mathrm{in}, S}$$\nRearranging gives the first linear equation:\n$$(g_{S} + g_{C})v_{S} - g_{C} v_{D} = I_{\\mathrm{in}, S} \\quad (1)$$\n\nFor the dendrite (node $D$), the currents leaving are the leak current, $g_{D} v_{D}$, and the axial current to the soma, $g_{C}(v_{D} - v_{S})$. The current entering is $I_{\\mathrm{in}, D}$. The balance equation is:\n$$g_{D} v_{D} + g_{C}(v_{D} - v_{S}) = I_{\\mathrm{in}, D}$$\nRearranging gives the second linear equation:\n$$-g_{C} v_{S} + (g_{D} + g_{C})v_{D} = I_{\\mathrm{in}, D} \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two unknown voltages, $v_{S}$ and $v_{D}$. Let us substitute the numerical values of the parameters (in units of nS for conductance, pA for current, and mV for voltage):\n$$g_{S} + g_{C} = 20 + 10 = 30\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\n$$g_{D} + g_{C} = 10 + 10 = 20\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\n$$g_{C} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{in}, S} = 26\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{in}, D} = 325\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n\nThe system of equations becomes:\n$$30 v_{S} - 10 v_{D} = 26$$\n$$-10 v_{S} + 20 v_{D} = 325$$\n\nWe can solve this system. From the first equation, we can express $v_{D}$ in terms of $v_{S}$:\n$$10 v_{D} = 30 v_{S} - 26 \\implies v_{D} = 3 v_{S} - 2.6$$\nSubstitute this expression for $v_{D}$ into the second equation:\n$$-10 v_{S} + 20 (3 v_{S} - 2.6) = 325$$\n$$-10 v_{S} + 60 v_{S} - 52 = 325$$\n$$50 v_{S} = 377$$\n$$v_{S} = \\frac{377}{50} = 7.54\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nNow we can find the dendritic voltage $v_{D}$:\n$$v_{D} = 3 v_{S} - 2.6 = 3 (7.54) - 2.6 = 22.62 - 2.6 = 20.02\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nThus, the somatic depolarization is $v_{S} = 7.54\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and the dendritic depolarization is $v_{D} = 20.02\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThe second task is to determine if a local dendritic spike is generated. The criterion is that the passive dendritic depolarization $v_{D}$ must reach or exceed a threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nOur calculated dendritic depolarization is $v_{D} = 20.02\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Comparing this to the threshold:\n$$v_{D} = 20.02\\,\\mathrm{mV} > V_{\\mathrm{th}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nSince the depolarization in the dendrite exceeds the threshold, a local dendritic spike is expected to be generated.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the somatic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude, $v_{S}$, rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $v_{S} = 7.54\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $7.540\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.540}\n$$", "id": "2587307"}]}
