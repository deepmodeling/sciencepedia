It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains consistent, physically realistic data. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core principle for this analysis is the steady-state energy balance equation, which dictates that for a stable body temperature, the rate of metabolic heat production ($M$) must equal the rate of heat loss to the environment ($H_L$).\n$$M = H_L$$\nThe problem states that heat loss is primarily via dry thermal conduction and convection, and can be modeled as being proportional to the temperature difference between the body ($T_b$) and the ambient environment ($T_a$).
