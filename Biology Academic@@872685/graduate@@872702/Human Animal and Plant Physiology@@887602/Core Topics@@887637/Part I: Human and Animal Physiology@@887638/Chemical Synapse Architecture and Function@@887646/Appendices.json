The provided values for physical constants, concentrations, and reaction rates are standard and widely accepted in the relevant literature.

The diffusion time for a calcium ion to travel from a voltage-gated calcium channel to the synaptic vesicle release sensor.\n2.  The binding time for a calcium ion to be captured by a mobile buffer (EGTA or BAPTA).\n3.  The interpulse interval, which sets the timescale for residual calcium effects.\n\nWe begin by calculating the relevant timescales.\n\n1.  **Calcium Diffusion Time ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}}$)**: The time for a calcium ion to diffuse the distance $L$ can be estimated using the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation for diffusion in one dimension, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle = 2Dt$. A characteristic time is thus $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx L^2 / (2D_{\\mathrm{Ca}})$.\n    Given $L = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 3 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = 220\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n    $$\n    \\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx \\frac{(3 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times (2.2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2}{4.4 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 2.05 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n    $$\n    This is the timescale for calcium to reach the sensor after channel opening.\n\n2.  **Buffer Binding Time ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}$)**: In the presence of a high concentration of buffer, the binding reaction can be treated as a pseudo-first-order process. The characteristic binding time is the inverse of the pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k' = k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\times [\\text{Buffer}]$. So, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}} = 1 / k'$.\n    -   For $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA:\n        $[\\text{EGTA}] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n        $k'_{\\mathrm{EGTA}} = (1 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n        $$\n        \\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} = \\frac{1}{10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n        $$\n    -   For $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA:\n        $[\\text{BAPTA}] = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n        $k'_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} = (5 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n        $$\n        \\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n        $$\n\n3.  **Interpulse Interval ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{interval}}$)**: This is given as $20\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 20,000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nNow, we analyze the effect of each buffer on the paired-pulse response. The paired-pulse ratio is $PPR = P_2 / P_1$, where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the amplitudes of the first and second postsynaptic responses. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) corresponds to $PPR > 1$ and is attributed to the buildup of \"residual calcium\" in the presynaptic terminal.\n\n**Effect on the First Pulse ($P_1$) - The Nanodomain Signal:**\nThe first pulse response, $P_1$, is triggered by the high, local concentration of calcium in the nanodomain. For a buffer to affect $P_1$, its binding time must be comparable to or shorter than the time it takes for calcium to reach and activate the sensor ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}}$).\n- **EGTA**: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ is much longer than $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. Thus, EGTA is too slow to intercept calcium ions as they travel from the channel to the sensor. It will not significantly affect the peak calcium concentration in the nanodomain and therefore will have a negligible effect on $P_1$.\n- **BAPTA**: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ is comparable to $\\tau_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\approx 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. BAPTA is fast enough to compete with the release sensor for calcium ions within the nanodomain. It will effectively buffer the incoming calcium, reduce the peak concentration at the sensor, and substantially decrease the first-pulse release probability, $P_1$.\n\n**Effect on Facilitation ($PPR$) - The Residual Calcium Signal:**\nFacilitation depends on residual calcium that lasts for tens of milliseconds after the first pulse. The interpulse interval is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{interval}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. For a buffer to affect facilitation, its binding time must be significantly shorter than this interval.\n- **EGTA**: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} \\ll 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. EGTA is highly effective at chelating the diffuse, low-concentration residual calcium between pulses. By eliminating the residual calcium, it eliminates the mechanism for facilitation.\n- **BAPTA**: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}^{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} \\ll 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. BAPTA is even more effective than EGTA at clearing residual calcium. It will also abolish facilitation.\n\n**Conclusion on PPR:**\n- **Control**: At many central synapses, the initial release probability is low, and they exhibit facilitation, so $PPR_{\\mathrm{control}} > 1$.\n- **With EGTA**: $P_1$ is largely unaffected. However, facilitation is abolished, meaning the second pulse is not enhanced. Thus, $P_2 \\approx P_1$, and the $PPR_{\\mathrm{EGTA}} \\approx 1$. Since $PPR_{\\mathrm{control}} > 1$, EGTA reduces facilitation (decreases the $PPR$).\n- **With BAPTA**: $P_1$ is significantly reduced. Facilitation is also abolished. Thus, the response to the second pulse will also be un-facilitated and small, such that $P_2 \\approx P_1$. The $PPR_{\\mathrm{BAPTA}} \\approx 1$. Again, this represents a decrease from the control $PPR > 1$.\n\nBoth buffers reduce or abolish facilitation, causing $PPR$ to decrease towards $1$. The key distinction is that BAPTA's fast kinetics allow it to also suppress the initial release itself, whereas slow EGTA cannot.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\nA. **Relative to control, $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA modestly reduces facilitation ($PPR$ decreases), whereas $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA strongly reduces or abolishes facilitation ($PPR$ decreases further), because BAPTA’s fast binding competes on the microsecond scale within the nanodomain and both buffers efficiently clamp residual calcium on the millisecond scale.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation.\n- \"EGTA modestly reduces facilitation ($PPR$ decreases)\": Correct. It brings $PPR$ from a value greater than $1$ down to approximately $1$ by clamping residual calcium.\n- \"BAPTA strongly reduces or abolishes facilitation ($PPR$ decreases further)\": Correct. BAPTA also brings $PPR$ to approximately $1$. The term \"strongly\" is justified as BAPTA affects the release mechanism for both pulses, not just the facilitation between them.\n- \"because BAPTA’s fast binding competes on the microsecond scale within the nanodomain\": Correct. This is why BAPTA affects $P_1$.\n- \"and both buffers efficiently clamp residual calcium on the millisecond scale\": Correct. This is why both buffers abolish the facilitatory component, i.e., reduce $PPR$ toward $1$.\nThe reasoning is comprehensive and accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **$10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA increases facilitation ($PPR$ increases) by lowering the first-pulse release probability, while $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA leaves facilitation unchanged at nanodomain synapses.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. EGTA does not increase facilitation in this context; it is a classic tool to reduce it by buffering residual calcium. Furthermore, EGTA is too slow to lower $P_1$ at a nanodomain synapse. BAPTA is a potent calcium chelator and will absolutely not leave facilitation \"unchanged\"; it will abolish it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Neither $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA nor $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA appreciably affects facilitation at a nanodomain synapse, because diffusion over tens of nanometers outpaces buffer binding on all relevant timescales.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. While diffusion is fast ($\\approx 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$), the binding time for BAPTA is comparably fast ($\\approx 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$), and the binding time for both buffers is much faster than the interpulse interval ($20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$). Therefore, both buffers will profoundly affect calcium signaling, particularly the residual calcium responsible for facilitation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **$10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ EGTA abolishes facilitation by intercepting nanodomain calcium spikes before they reach the sensor, whereas $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA is largely ineffective at the stated concentration due to insufficient capacity.**\nThis statement contains two major errors. First, the reason given for EGTA's effect is wrong; its binding time of $\\approx 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ is far too slow to intercept a nanodomain spike that develops in $\\approx 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. Second, the claim that $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ BAPTA is ineffective is false. This concentration of a fast, high-affinity buffer is extremely potent, both kinetically (as shown by $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}$) and in terms of capacity (it can bind far more calcium than enters during a few action potentials).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2557693"}, {"introduction": "Synapses are not static devices; their efficacy changes dynamically during ongoing activity, a property crucial for information processing.

All provided data are physically consistent and the problem is self-contained. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the discrete-time evolution of the number of vesicles in the readily releasable pool (RRP), $N$, and then find its steady-state value under periodic stimulation. Let us denote the number of vesicles in the RRP immediately before the $k$-th stimulus as $N_k$, for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The stimuli are separated by a constant inter-stimulus interval $\\Delta t = 1/f$.\n\nThe evolution of the system can be decomposed into two distinct phases for each interval between stimuli:\n\n1.  **Instantaneous Depletion:** At the time of a stimulus, a fraction $p$ of the available vesicles is released. The number of vesicles released at the $k$-th stimulus, $R_k$, is given by:\n    $$R_k = p N_k$$\n    Immediately after this release, the number of vesicles in the RRP is reduced to:\n    $$N_k^+ = N_k - R_k = N_k - p N_k = (1 - p) N_k$$\n    Here, $N_k^+$ denotes the pool size immediately after the $k$-th stimulus.\n\n2.  **Continuous Replenishment:** Between stimuli, from time $t_k^+$ (just after stimulus $k$) to time $t_{k+1}^-$ (just before stimulus $k+1$), the RRP replenishes. This process is governed by the first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n    $$\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{N_{\\max} - N}{\\tau}$$\n    This is a linear first-order ODE.

Given that the problem states $N_{\\max} = N_0$, we can write:\n$$N_{k+1} = N_0 + \\left( (1-p)N_k - N_0 \\right) e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}$$\n$$N_{k+1} = N_0(1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}) + N_k (1-p)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}$$\nThis is a linear recurrence of the form $N_{k+1} = a N_k + b$, where the coefficient $a = (1-p)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}$ and the constant term $b = N_0(1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau})$. Since $0 \\le p \\le 1$ and $e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau} > 0$, the coefficient $|a|  1$ (unless $p=0$ and $\\Delta t \\to 0$, which is not a physical scenario considered here), ensuring that the sequence converges to a unique fixed point.\n\nTo find the steady-state number of vesicles, $N_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, we set $N_{k+1} = N_k = N_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ as $k \\to \\infty$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{ss}} = N_0(1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}) + N_{\\mathrm{ss}} (1-p)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}$$\nWe solve for $N_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{ss}} - N_{\\mathrm{ss}} (1-p)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau} = N_0(1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau})$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\left( 1 - (1-p)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau} \\right) = N_0(1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau})$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{N_0(1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau})}{1 - (1-p)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}}$$\nThis is the steady-state number of vesicles in the RRP immediately before each stimulus.\n\nThe question asks for the asymptotic steady-state expected release per stimulus, $R_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. This is simply $p$ times the steady-state pool size $N_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = p N_{\\mathrm{ss}} = p \\frac{N_0(1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau})}{1 - (1-p)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}}$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta t = 1/f$, we obtain the final expression to be computed for each test case:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = p \\frac{N_0(1 - e^{-1/(f\\tau)})}{1 - (1-p)e^{-1/(f\\tau)}}$$\n\nThis formula will be implemented to solve for the given test cases. For the edge case where $p=0$, the formula correctly yields $R_{\\mathrm{ss}}=0$, as no vesicles can be released. For the case $p=1$, the formula simplifies to $R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = N_0(1 - e^{-1/(f\\tau)})$, representing the total amount replenished from an empty pool during the inter-stimulus interval.
