When the head is tilted by an angle $\\theta$ (in degrees) relative to gravity, the weight of the otoconia is opposed by buoyancy, producing a net force that has a component tangential to the macular plane. Assume the following:\n- The otoconia-endolymph system is quasistatic (no acceleration other than gravity), and the only body forces are due to gravity and buoyancy.\n- The otoconial layer contacts and shears uniformly over the macula; thus shear force distributes uniformly as a shear stress across area $A_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n- The hair bundles are uniformly distributed with areal density $n_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and behave as identical linear springs of stiffness $k_{\\mathrm{b}}$ that are perfectly coupled to the otolithic membrane, so that each bundle experiences the local shear displacement.\n- The density difference is $\\Delta \\rho \\equiv \\rho_{\\mathrm{o}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{e}}$.\n\nStarting from Archimedes’ principle and Newton’s laws, derive a general expression for the shear force on the macula, $F_{\\mathrm{shear}}$, as a function of $m_{\\mathrm{o}}$, $\\Delta \\rho$, and $\\theta$.

It is well-posed and objective. The provided parameters are physiologically plausible. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe derivation is performed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the shear force, $F_{\\mathrm{shear}}$.\nThe otoconial mass $m_{\\mathrm{o}}$ is subject to two body forces acting along the vertical direction: the gravitational force $\\vec{F}_{\\mathrm{g}}$ and the buoyant force $\\vec{F}_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\nThe gravitational force has magnitude $F_{\\mathrm{g}} = m_{\\mathrm{o}} g$ and acts downwards.\nThe volume of the otoconia is $V_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{o}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}}$. By Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced endolymph. Its magnitude is $F_{\\mathrm{b}} = V_{\\mathrm{o}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{e}} g = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{o}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{e}} g$, and it acts upwards, opposing gravity.\nThe net force, or effective weight, $\\vec{F}_{\\mathrm{net}}$, is the vector sum of these two forces. Since they are collinear and opposite, its magnitude is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{net}} = F_{\\mathrm{g}} - F_{\\mathrm{b}} = m_{\\mathrm{o}} g - \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{o}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{e}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}} g = m_{\\mathrm{o}} g \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{e}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}}\\right)$$\nThis can be expressed using the provided definition $\\Delta \\rho \\equiv \\rho_{\\mathrm{o}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{e}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{net}} = m_{\\mathrm{o}} g \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{e}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}}\\right) = m_{\\mathrm{o}} g \\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}}$$\nThis net force vector is directed vertically downwards. The macular plane is tilted at an angle $\\theta$ relative to gravity. Assuming $\\theta=0$ corresponds to a horizontal macula, the shear force $F_{\\mathrm{shear}}$ is the component of $\\vec{F}_{\\mathrm{net}}$ tangent to the macular plane. The angle between the vertical net force vector and the macular plane is $90^{\\circ} - \\theta$, but it is more direct to state that the component of a vertical force tangent to a plane tilted at angle $\\theta$ from horizontal is proportional to $\\sin(\\theta)$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{shear}} = F_{\\mathrm{net}} \\sin(\\theta)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{\\mathrm{net}}$ gives the general expression for the shear force:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{shear}} = m_{\\mathrm{o}} g \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{e}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}}\\right) \\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the single hair-bundle deflection, $x$.\nThe total shear force $F_{\\mathrm{shear}}$ is distributed uniformly over the area of the macula $A_{\\mathrm{m}}$, borne by the hair bundles. The total number of hair bundles, $N_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is the product of their areal density $n_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and the area $A_{\\mathrm{m}}$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{b}} = n_{\\mathrm{b}} A_{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nAccording to the assumption of uniform load sharing, the force experienced by a single hair bundle, $f_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is the total shear force divided by the total number of bundles:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{shear}}}{N_{\\mathrm{b}}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{shear}}}{n_{\\mathrm{b}} A_{\\mathrm{m}}}$$\nEach hair bundle is modeled as a linear spring with stiffness $k_{\\mathrm{b}}$. From Hooke's Law, the force on the spring is related to its deflection $x$ by $f_{\\mathrm{b}} = k_{\\mathrm{b}} x$.\nEquating the two expressions for $f_{\\mathrm{b}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{b}} x = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{shear}}}{n_{\\mathrm{b}} A_{\\mathrm{m}}}$$\nSolving for the deflection $x$ gives the desired expression:\n$$x = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{shear}}}{n_{\\mathrm{b}} A_{\\mathrm{m}} k_{\\mathrm{b}}}$$\n\nPart 3: Numerical calculation.\nWe combine the expressions for $F_{\\mathrm{shear}}$ and $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{1}{n_{\\mathrm{b}} A_{\\mathrm{m}} k_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\left[ m_{\\mathrm{o}} g \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{e}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}}\\right) \\sin(\\theta) \\right]$$\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must convert all parameters to a consistent set of SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds).\n- $A_{\\mathrm{m}} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{mm^{2}} = 3.0 \\times (10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})^{2} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}}$\n- $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{mm^{-2}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\times (10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})^{-2} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$\nThe other parameters are already in SI units.

Substituting these values into the equations:\n$$x_L = (1)(0.6)(100) - 0.5 x_R \\implies x_L = 60 - 0.5 x_R$$\n$$x_R = (1)(100) - 0.5 x_L \\implies x_R = 100 - 0.5 x_L$$\nThis is a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $x_L$ and $x_R$. We solve this system. Substitute the second equation into the first:\n$$x_L = 60 - 0.5(100 - 0.5 x_L)$$\n$$x_L = 60 - 50 + 0.25 x_L$$\n$$x_L - 0.25 x_L = 10$$\n$$0.75 x_L = 10$$\n$$x_L = \\frac{10}{0.75} = \\frac{10}{3/4} = \\frac{40}{3}$$\nNow, we find $x_R$ by substituting the value of $x_L$ back into the second equation:\n$$x_R = 100 - 0.5 \\left(\\frac{40}{3}\\right)$$\n$$x_R = 100 - \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{300 - 20}{3} = \\frac{280}{3}$$\nThe imbalance between the two nuclei outputs is the difference $x_R - x_L$:\n$$x_R - x_L = \\frac{280}{3} - \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{240}{3} = 80$$\nThis difference drives both the perceived rotation and the VOR.\n\nThe perceived angular velocity $\\hat{\\omega}$ is given by:\n$$\\hat{\\omega} = k_p (x_R - x_L)$$\nWith $k_p = 0.08\\,^{\\circ}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ per unit of difference:\n$$\\hat{\\omega} = (0.08) \\cdot (80) = 6.4\\,^{\\circ}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nSince $x_R  x_L$, the brain interprets this imbalance as a rotation toward the side with higher activity, which is the right side. The right side is the \"intact\" side, while the left is the pharmacologically \"lesioned\" side. Thus, the perceived rotation is toward the right.\n\nThe VOR slow-phase eye velocity $v_{\\text{slow}}$ is given by:\n$$v_{\\text{slow}} = k_v (x_R - x_L)$$\nWith $k_v = 0.1\\,^{\\circ}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ per unit of difference:\n$$v_{\\text{slow}} = (0.1) \\cdot (80) = 8\\,^{\\circ}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe purpose of the VOR is to stabilize gaze.

However, it incorrectly names the nystagmus direction. A slow phase to the left results in a fast phase to the right, which defines a right-beating nystagmus, not a left-beating one.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. No perceived rotation and no spontaneous nystagmus occur because commissural inhibition equalizes bilateral outputs at steady state.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The asymmetric input ($ \\lambda r_0 $ vs $r_0$) prevents the outputs from being equal. Our calculation shows $x_L = 40/3$ and $x_R = 280/3$, which are not equal. Commissural inhibition reshapes the activities but does not equalize them in the face of asymmetric drive.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to find the value of $\\hat{a}_{x}(T)$. We begin by expressing $\\hat{a}_{x}(t)$ in terms of the fundamental state variables.\nFrom the definition, $\\hat{a}_{x}(t) = \\hat{g}_{x}(t) - o_{x}(t)$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\hat{g}_{x}(t)$ and $o_{x}(t)$:\n$$\n\\hat{a}_{x}(t) = g\\,\\hat{\\theta}(t) - (g_{x}(t) - a_{x}(t))\n$$\nUsing the small-angle approximation $g_{x}(t) \\approx g\\,\\theta(t)$:\n$$\n\\hat{a}_{x}(t) = g\\,\\hat{\\theta}(t) - g\\,\\theta(t) + a_{x}(t) = g(\\hat{\\theta}(t) - \\theta(t)) + a_{x}(t)\n$$\nSince $a_{x}(t) = a_{0}$ for all $t \\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\hat{a}_{x}(T) = g(\\hat{\\theta}(T) - \\theta(T)) + a_{0}\n$$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the true pitch angle $\\theta(T)$ and the estimated pitch angle $\\hat{\\theta}(T)$.\n\n1.  **Solve for the true pitch angle $\\theta(t)$:**\n    The true pitch angle is the integral of the true angular velocity, $\\dot{\\theta}(t) = \\omega(t)$, with the initial condition $\\theta(0)=0$.\n    For $0 \\le t \\le T_{1}$, $\\omega(t) = \\Omega$. Integrating gives $\\theta(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\Omega \\,d\\tau = \\Omega t$.\n    At $t=T_{1}$, the angle is $\\theta(T_{1}) = \\Omega T_{1}$.\n    For $t  T_{1}$, $\\omega(t) = 0$. The angle remains constant: $\\theta(t) = \\theta(T_{1}) = \\Omega T_{1}$.\n    Since the evaluation time is $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $T_{1}=4\\,\\mathrm{s}$, we have $T  T_{1}$.

The equation is homogeneous, $\\tau_{c}\\,\\dot{\\omega}_{c} + \\omega_{c} = 0$. The solution is a decaying exponential from the value at $T_{1}$:\n      $\\omega_{c}(t) = \\omega_{c}(T_{1})\\exp(-(t-T_{1})/\\tau_{c})$ for $t  T_{1}$.\n\n    2b. **Solve for the estimated pitch angle $\\hat{\\theta}(t)$:**\n    The governing equation is $\\dot{\\hat{\\theta}}(t) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{L}}\\hat{\\theta}(t) = \\omega_{c}(t)$ with $\\hat{\\theta}(0)=0$. We must solve this piecewise.\n    - For $0 \\le t \\le T_{1}$: $\\omega_{c}(t) = \\Omega(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_{c}))$. The solution to this ODE with $\\hat{\\theta}(0)=0$ is:\n      $$\n      \\hat{\\theta}(t) = \\Omega \\tau_{L} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_{L})) - \\Omega \\frac{\\tau_c \\tau_L}{\\tau_c - \\tau_L} \\left(\\exp(-t/\\tau_c) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_L)\\right)\n      $$\n      The value at $t=T_1$, which serves as the initial condition for the next phase, is:\n      $$\n      \\hat{\\theta}(T_1) = \\Omega \\tau_{L} (1 - \\exp(-T_1/\\tau_{L})) - \\Omega \\frac{\\tau_c \\tau_L}{\\tau_c - \\tau_L} \\left(\\exp(-T_1/\\tau_c) - \\exp(-T_1/\\tau_L)\\right)\n      $$\n    - For $t  T_{1}$: The equation is $\\dot{\\hat{\\theta}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{L}}\\hat{\\theta} = \\omega_{c}(T_{1})\\exp(-(t-T_{1})/\\tau_{c})$. The solution is the sum of a homogeneous part and a particular solution, satisfying the condition at $t=T_{1}$.\n      The solution for $t  T_{1}$ can be written as:\n      $$\n      \\hat{\\theta}(t) = A_{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-T_{1}}{\\tau_{L}}\\right) + K_{p} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-T_{1}}{\\tau_{c}}\\right)\n      $$\n      where the constants $A_{h}$ and $K_{p}$ are determined by the system parameters and the solution at $T_{1}$. Through algebraic simplification, these constants are found to be:\n      $$\n      A_{h} = \\frac{\\Omega\\tau_L^2}{\\tau_L-\\tau_c}\\left(1 - \\exp(-T_1/\\tau_L)\\right)\n      $$\n      $$\n      K_{p} = \\frac{\\Omega\\tau_c\\tau_L}{\\tau_c-\\tau_L}\\left(1 - \\exp(-T_1/\\tau_c)\\right)\n      $$\n      Therefore, for $t  T_{1}$, the estimated angle is:\n      $$\n      \\hat{\\theta}(t) = \\frac{\\Omega\\tau_L^2}{\\tau_L-\\tau_c}\\left(1 - \\exp(-T_1/\\tau_L)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-T_{1}}{\\tau_{L}}\\right) + \\frac{\\Omega\\tau_c\\tau_L}{\\tau_c-\\tau_L}\\left(1 - \\exp(-T_1/\\tau_c)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-T_{1}}{\\tau_{c}}\\right)\n      $$\n\n3.  **Assemble the final expression and compute the value:**\n    We need to evaluate $\\hat{\\theta}(T)$ using the expression for $t  T_1$.\n    $$\n    \\hat{\\theta}(T) = \\frac{\\Omega\\tau_L^2}{\\tau_L-\\tau_c}\\left(1 - \\exp(-T_1/\\tau_L)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T-T_{1}}{\\tau_{L}}\\right) + \\frac{\\Omega\\tau_c\\tau_L}{\\tau_c-\\tau_L}\\left(1 - \\exp(-T_1/\\tau_c)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T-T_{1}}{\\tau_{c}}\\right)\n    $$\n    And $\\theta(T) = \\Omega T_1$.\n    The complete analytical expression for the estimated acceleration is:\n    $$\n    \\hat{a}_{x}(T) = g\\left[ \\frac{\\Omega\\tau_L^2}{\\tau_L-\\tau_c}\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\frac{T_1}{\\tau_L})\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T-T_1}{\\tau_L}\\right) + \\frac{\\Omega\\tau_c\\tau_L}{\\tau_c-\\tau_L}\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\frac{T_1}{\\tau_c})\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T-T_1}{\\tau_c}\\right) - \\Omega T_1 \\right] + a_0\n    $$\n\n    **Numerical Calculation:**\n    Given parameters:\n    $g = 9.81$, $a_0 = 1.0$, $\\Omega = 0.05$, $T_1 = 4$, $T = 10$, $\\tau_c = 5$, $\\tau_L = 20$.\n\n    - True final angle:\n      $\\theta(T) = \\Omega T_1 = 0.05 \\times 4 = 0.2$ rad.\n\n    - Exponentials needed:\n      $T_1/\\tau_L = 4/20 = 0.2$\n      $T_1/\\tau_c = 4/5 = 0.8$\n      $(T-T_1)/\\tau_L = (10-4)/20 = 6/20 = 0.3$\n      $(T-T_1)/\\tau_c = (10-4)/5 = 6/5 = 1.2$\n\n    - Coefficients:\n      $\\frac{\\Omega\\tau_L^2}{\\tau_L-\\tau_c} = \\frac{0.05 \\times 20^2}{20-5} = \\frac{0.05 \\times 400}{15} = \\frac{20}{15} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n      $\\frac{\\Omega\\tau_c\\tau_L}{\\tau_c-\\tau_L} = \\frac{0.05 \\times 5 \\times 20}{5-20} = \\frac{5}{-15} = -\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    - Estimated angle $\\hat{\\theta}(T)$:\n      $\\hat{\\theta}(T) = \\frac{4}{3}(1 - \\exp(-0.2))\\exp(-0.3) - \\frac{1}{3}(1-\\exp(-0.8))\\exp(-1.2)$\n      $\\hat{\\theta}(T) \\approx \\frac{4}{3}(1 - 0.81873075)(0.74081822) - \\frac{1}{3}(1-0.44932896)(0.30119421)$\n      $\\hat{\\theta}(T) \\approx \\frac{4}{3}(0.18126925)(0.74081822) - \\frac{1}{3}(0.55067104)(0.30119421)$\n      $\\hat{\\theta}(T) \\approx (0.24169233)(0.74081822) - (0.18355701)(0.30119421)$\n      $\\hat{\\theta}(T) \\approx 0.17905874 - 0.05529711 \\approx 0.12376163$ rad.\n\n    - Final estimated acceleration $\\hat{a}_{x}(T)$:\n      $\\hat{a}_{x}(T) = g(\\hat{\\theta}(T) - \\theta(T)) + a_0$\n      $\\hat{a}_{x}(T) \\approx 9.81 \\times (0.12376163 - 0.2) + 1.0$\n      $\\hat{a}_{x}(T) \\approx 9.81 \\times (-0.07623837) + 1.0$\n      $\\hat{a}_{x}(T) \\approx -0.747900 + 1.0 = 0.252100$\n\n    Rounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.2521$.
