The provided parameters are physiologically plausible for a mammalian cell. The problem is self-contained and presents no logical contradictions or ambiguities. It requires a derivation from fundamental principles, which is a rigorous test of understanding. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the net sodium current, $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, begins from the definition of the electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, for an ionic species $j$. This potential is the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy per mole.\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_j) + z_j F V $$\nHere, $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_j$ is the chemical activity of the ion, $z_j$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electric potential.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane. This condition implies that the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal across the two compartments, the cytosol (in) and the mucosal solution (out). For sodium ions ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$), this is expressed as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na, in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na, out}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}}^0 + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Na, in}}) + z_{\\mathrm{Na}} F V_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}}^0 + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Na, out}}) + z_{\\mathrm{Na}} F V_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe standard potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}}^0$ cancels out. Rearranging the terms to find the potential difference across the membrane, $V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}$, yields:\n$$ z_{\\mathrm{Na}} F (V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}) = RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Na, out}}) - RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Na, in}}) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Na, out}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Na, in}}}\\right) $$\nThis specific membrane potential difference at which an ion is in equilibrium is defined as the Nernst potential, $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Na}}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Na, out}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Na, in}}}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that for these dilute solutions, the ratio of activities can be approximated by the ratio of concentrations, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Na}}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) $$\nThis expression gives the reversal potential for sodium ions. When the membrane potential $V_m$ is not equal to $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, there is a net electrochemical driving force on the ions, given by $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Na}})$. This driving force produces a net current, $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, through the available conductive pathways.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law applied to ion channels, the macroscopic ionic current is the product of the macroscopic conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, and the electrochemical driving force.\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = G_{\\mathrm{Na}} (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}) $$\nThe problem defines the macroscopic conductance as the product of the total number of channels, $N$, the probability that a single channel is open, $P_o$, and the conductance of a single open channel, $\\gamma$.\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{Na}} = N \\cdot P_o \\cdot \\gamma $$\nSubstituting this definition into the current equation gives the complete expression for the net sodium current:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = N P_o \\gamma \\left( V_m - \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Na}}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis completes the required derivation.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantitative pharmacology that is scientifically grounded and internally consistent. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages. First, the inhibition constant, $K_i$, of the antagonist probenecid is determined from the competitive binding assay data. Second, this $K_i$ value is used to predict the rightward shift (dose ratio, $r$) of the agonist concentration-response curve in the functional assay.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Inhibition Constant ($K_i$)**\n\nFor a competitive antagonist, the relationship between its half-maximal inhibitory concentration ($IC_{50}$) and its equilibrium inhibition constant ($K_i$) is described by the Cheng-Prusoff equation. This equation accounts for the presence of the labeled agonist (tracer) in the binding assay.\n\nThe Cheng-Prusoff equation is:\n$$K_i = \\frac{IC_{50}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_d}}$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the concentration of the agonist tracer and $K_d$ is its equilibrium dissociation constant.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $IC_{50} = 500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[A] = 4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_d = 8.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$K_i = \\frac{500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1 + \\frac{4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{8.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1 + 0.5} = \\frac{500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1.5}$$\n$$K_i = \\frac{1000}{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThis is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the competitive antagonist, probenecid.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Dose Ratio ($r$)**\n\nThe problem describes a functional assay where the concentration-response curve for the agonist denatonium is measured in the absence and presence of the antagonist probenecid. For a purely competitive antagonist at equilibrium, the effect on the agonist's potency is quantified by the dose ratio, $r$. The value of $r$ depends on the concentration of the antagonist, $[I]$, and its affinity for the receptor, as described by its inhibition constant, $K_i$.\n\nThe relationship is given by the Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$r = 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}$$\nThis equation is directly applicable here due to the assumptions of pure competitive antagonism, equilibrium conditions, and negligible receptor reserve with $n_H = 1$, which together imply that the agonist's functional $EC_{50}$ is directly shifted by receptor competition. The inhibition constant $K_i$ determined from the binding assay is equivalent to the antagonist dissociation constant $K_B$ often used in the Schild analysis.\n\nThe given concentration of the antagonist is $[I] = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. For consistency of units with $K_i$, this must be converted to $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$[I] = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 1.00 \\times 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nNow, substitute the values of $[I]$ and the previously calculated $K_i$ into the Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$r = 1 + \\frac{1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{\\frac{1000}{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\nThe units of $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ cancel out, as expected for the dimensionless dose ratio:\n$$r = 1 + \\frac{1000 \\times 3}{1000} = 1 + 3 = 4$$\nThe calculated dose ratio is exactly $4$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Expressing $4$ with three significant figures gives $4.00$.\n\nTherefore, the presence of $1.00\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ probenecid is predicted to cause a four-fold rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for denatonium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00}$$", "id": "2572704"}, {"introduction": "The final step is to connect the microscopic world of channels and receptors to the macroscopic experience of perception.
