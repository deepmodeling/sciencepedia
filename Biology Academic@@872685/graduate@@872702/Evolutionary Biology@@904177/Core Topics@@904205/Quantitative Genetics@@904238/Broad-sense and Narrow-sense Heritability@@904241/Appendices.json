This initial exercise provides a fundamental workout in this process, allowing you to calculate both broad-sense ($H^2$) and narrow-sense ($h^2$) heritability from their component variances. Mastering this decomposition is the first step toward understanding why only one of these metrics predicts the evolutionary response to selection [@problem_id:2831007].", "problem": "A sexually reproducing, randomly mating population expresses a quantitative trait influenced by many loci. Under the standard decomposition of phenotypic variance into genetic and environmental components, the following variance components have been estimated from a properly designed breeding experiment with no genotype-by-environment interaction and no genotype-environment covariance: additive genetic variance $V_{A} = 0.40$, dominance genetic variance $V_{D} = 0.10$, additive-by-additive epistatic variance $V_{AA} = 0.05$, and environmental variance $V_{E} = 0.45$. Assume linkage equilibrium at the time of estimation and that these components are defined in the usual sense of quantitative genetics for a randomly mating diploid population.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions and results of quantitative genetics (variance decomposition and the meaning of heritabilities as variance proportions), do the following:\n\n1. Derive the total phenotypic variance $V_{P}$ from the given components.\n2. From first principles, define and compute the narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$ and the broad-sense heritability $H^{2}$ for this trait.\n3. Based on the fundamental connection between parent-offspring resemblance and additive genetic variance in sexually reproducing populations, reason which heritability quantity is the appropriate predictor of the immediate response to artificial truncation selection among unrelated individuals and why. Your reasoning should begin from the variance decomposition and proceed through the logic that connects transmitted genetic effects to expected offspring phenotype.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- Provide your final numeric results as a single row matrix containing $h^{2}$ and $H^{2}$ in that order, with no units. No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in quantitative genetics. A validation of its premises confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary data for a unique solution and is free from internal contradictions or logical flaws. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three tasks to be completed based on a given set of variance components for a quantitative trait in a randomly mating population. The components are: additive genetic variance $V_{A} = 0.40$, dominance genetic variance $V_{D} = 0.10$, additive-by-additive epistatic variance $V_{AA} = 0.05$, and environmental variance $V_{E} = 0.45$. It is also stated that there is no genotype-by-environment interaction and no genotype-environment covariance.\n\n1. Derivation of total phenotypic variance, $V_{P}$.\n\nThe total phenotypic variance, $V_{P}$, of a trait is decomposed into its causal components. The fundamental model is:\n$$V_{P} = V_{G} + V_{E} + V_{G \\times E} + 2\\text{Cov}(G, E)$$\nwhere $V_{G}$ is the total genetic variance, $V_{E}$ is the environmental variance, $V_{G \\times E}$ is the variance due to interaction between genotype and environment, and $\\text{Cov}(G, E)$ is the covariance between genotypic and environmental effects.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that $V_{G \\times E} = 0$ and $\\text{Cov}(G, E) = 0$. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$$V_{P} = V_{G} + V_{E}$$\nThe total genetic variance, $V_{G}$, is the sum of the variances of its components. The genotypic value ($G$) is decomposed as $G = A + D + I$, where $A$ is the additive genetic value (breeding value), $D$ is the dominance deviation, and $I$ is the epistatic (interaction) deviation. Assuming these components are uncorrelated, the genetic variance is:\n$$V_{G} = V_{A} + V_{D} + V_{I}$$\nwhere $V_{A}$ is the additive genetic variance, $V_{D}$ is the dominance genetic variance, and $V_{I}$ is the epistatic variance. The epistatic variance can be further decomposed into components such as additive-by-additive ($V_{AA}$), additive-by-dominance ($V_{AD}$), and so on. The problem provides a value for $V_{AA}$ and no other epistatic components. We must assume that other components of $V_{I}$ are zero or negligible, so we take $V_{I} \\approx V_{AA}$.\n\nUsing the given values:\n$V_{A} = 0.40$\n$V_{D} = 0.10$\n$V_{AA} = 0.05$\n\nThe total genetic variance is calculated as:\n$$V_{G} = V_{A} + V_{D} + V_{AA} = 0.40 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.55$$\nNow, we can compute the total phenotypic variance using the given environmental variance, $V_{E} = 0.45$:\n$$V_{P} = V_{G} + V_{E} = 0.55 + 0.45 = 1.00$$\nThe total phenotypic variance is $V_{P} = 1.00$.\n\n2. Definition and computation of heritabilities.\n\nBroad-sense heritability, $H^{2}$, is defined as the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is attributable to all genetic differences among individuals. It is the ratio of the total genetic variance to the total phenotypic variance:\n$$H^{2} = \\frac{V_{G}}{V_{P}}$$\nUsing the values derived above:\n$$H^{2} = \\frac{0.55}{1.00} = 0.55$$\n\nNarrow-sense heritability, $h^{2}$, is defined as the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is attributable only to additive genetic variance. The additive variance is the component of genetic variance responsible for the resemblance between parents and offspring.\n$$h^{2} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}}$$\nUsing the given and derived values:\n$$h^{2} = \\frac{0.40}{1.00} = 0.40$$\n\n3. Reasoning for predictor of selection response.\n\nThe response to selection ($R$) is the change in the mean phenotype of a population from one generation to the next as a result of selection. The magnitude of this response is predicted by the Breeder's Equation, $R = h^{2}S$, where $S$ is the selection differential (the difference between the mean of the selected parents and the mean of the entire parental generation). To understand why $h^{2}$, and not $H^{2}$, is the correct predictor, we must examine the basis of resemblance between relatives from first principles.\n\nIn a sexually reproducing diploid population, each parent passes a random half of its alleles to an offspring. The phenotype of an individual ($P$) is a function of its genotype ($G$) and its environment ($E$), so $P = G + E$. The genotypic value $G$ is itself a sum of the additive or breeding value ($A$), dominance deviation ($D$), and epistatic deviation ($I$).\n\nThe breeding value, $A$, is defined as the sum of the average effects of the alleles an individual carries. Because an individual passes on its alleles, not its full genotype, to its progeny, it is the breeding value that determines the mean genotypic value of its offspring. Specifically, the expected breeding value of an offspring is the average of the parental breeding values: $E[A_{offspring}] = \\frac{1}{2}(A_{parent1} + A_{parent2})$.\n\nDominance deviation, $D$, arises from the interaction between alleles at a single locus. A specific combination of two alleles (e.g., $A_{1}A_{2}$) might produce a certain dominance effect. However, a parent transmits only one allele from this pair to an offspring. The dominance effect in the parent is therefore broken up during meiosis and is not transmitted.\n\nEpistatic deviation, $I$, arises from interactions between alleles at different loci. These non-additive interactions are also disrupted by segregation and recombination during meiosis. Therefore, like dominance effects, epistatic effects are generally not passed on from parent to offspring in a predictable manner under random mating.\n\nThe quantitative measure of parent-offspring resemblance is the covariance of their phenotypes. Let us consider the regression of an offspring's phenotype, $P_O$, on the average phenotype of its two parents (the mid-parent value), $P_{MP} = (P_{1} + P_{2}) / 2$. The slope of this regression is a direct measure of heritability.\n$$b_{O,MP} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(P_{O}, P_{MP})}{\\text{Var}(P_{MP})}$$\nThe covariance term is $\\text{Cov}(A_O + D_O + I_O + E_O, A_{MP} + D_{MP} + I_{MP} + E_{MP})$. Ignoring environmental covariances and covariances with non-additive terms, this simplifies to $\\text{Cov}(A_O, A_{MP})$.\nGiven $A_O = \\frac{1}{2}A_1 + \\frac{1}{2}A_2$, we have $\\text{Cov}(A_O, A_{MP}) = \\text{Cov}(\\frac{1}{2}(A_1+A_2), \\frac{1}{2}(A_1+A_2)) = \\frac{1}{4}\\text{Var}(A_1+A_2)$. If parents are unrelated, $\\text{Var}(A_1+A_2) = V_A + V_A = 2V_A$. So, $\\text{Cov}(A_O, A_{MP}) = \\frac{1}{2}V_A$.\nThe variance of the mid-parent value is $\\text{Var}(P_{MP}) = \\text{Var}(\\frac{P_1+P_2}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\text{Var}(P_1)+\\text{Var}(P_2)) = \\frac{1}{4}(V_P+V_P) = \\frac{1}{2}V_P$.\nTherefore, the regression slope is:\n$$b_{O,MP} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}V_{A}}{\\frac{1}{2}V_{P}} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}} = h^{2}$$\nThis result formally demonstrates that the degree to which an offspring's phenotype resembles its parents' phenotypes is determined by the proportion of phenotypic variance that is additive genetic variance, i.e., the narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$.\n\nSince the response to selection depends directly on the degree to which parental superiority is transmitted to offspring, it is $h^{2}$ that governs the predictable change across generations. Broad-sense heritability, $H^{2}$, includes variance from non-additive genetic effects ($V_D$ and $V_I$) which are not faithfully transmitted from parent to offspring in sexually reproducing populations. Therefore, $H^{2}$ overestimates the potential evolutionary response to selection and is not the appropriate predictive quantity. The correct predictor is the narrow-sense heritability, $h^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.40  0.55 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2831007"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of how heritability is defined, we can move to its most critical application: predicting evolutionary change.

It is a non-trivial problem that illuminates a key concept.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe phenotypic value, $P$, of an individual is given by its genotypic value, $G$, plus an environmental deviation, $E$. The total phenotypic variance, $V_P$, is the sum of the genetic variance, $V_G$, and the environmental variance, $V_E$, assuming no genotype-environment correlation or interaction.\n$V_P = V_G + V_E$\n\nThe problem states that there is no environmental variance, so $V_E=0$. Consequently, all phenotypic variance is genetic: $V_P = V_G$.\n\nThe genetic variance, $V_G$, for a single locus can be partitioned into additive genetic variance, $V_A$, and dominance variance, $V_D$.\n$V_G = V_A + V_D$\n\nBroad-sense heritability, $H^2$, is the proportion of total phenotypic variance due to all genetic factors:\n$H^2 = \\frac{V_G}{V_P}$\n\nNarrow-sense heritability, $h^2$, is the proportion of total phenotypic variance due to additive genetic effects only:\n$h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}$\n\nThe slope of an offspring-on-mid-parent regression is a standard empirical estimator for $h^2$. The observation that this slope is near $0$ is consistent with the report that the estimate of $h^2$ is near $0$. We must now calculate these variance components from first principles using the provided data.\n\nThe genotypic values are $g_{AA}=0$, $g_{Aa}=1$, $g_{aa}=0$. This is a case of pure overdominance, where the heterozygote's value is outside the range of both homozygotes. Let us place these values on a scale and define the standard parameters $a$ and $d$. The origin is the midpoint between the two homozygotes, $(g_{AA} + g_{aa})/2 = (0+0)/2 = 0$.\n-   The additive effect, $a$, is half the difference between homozygotes: $a = \\frac{g_{AA} - g_{aa}}{2} = \\frac{0-0}{2}=0$.\n-   The dominance effect, $d$, is the deviation of the heterozygote from the midpoint of the homozygotes: $d = g_{Aa} - \\frac{g_{AA} + g_{aa}}{2} = 1 - \\frac{0+0}{2} = 1$.\n\nThe population mean genotypic value, $\\mu_G$, is calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg frequencies:\n$\\mu_G = p^2 g_{AA} + 2pq g_{Aa} + q^2 g_{aa}$\nGiven $p=q=0.5$:\n$\\mu_G = (0.5)^2(0) + 2(0.5)(0.5)(1) + (0.5)^2(0) = 0 + 0.5 + 0 = 0.5$\n\nThe total genetic variance, $V_G$, is the expected value of the squared deviations from the mean:\n$V_G = p^2(g_{AA}-\\mu_G)^2 + 2pq(g_{Aa}-\\mu_G)^2 + q^2(g_{aa}-\\mu_G)^2$\n$V_G = (0.25)(0-0.5)^2 + (0.5)(1-0.5)^2 + (0.25)(0-0.5)^2$\n$V_G = (0.25)(-0.5)^2 + (0.5)(0.5)^2 + (0.25)(-0.5)^2$\n$V_G = (0.25)(0.25) + (0.5)(0.25) + (0.25)(0.25) = 0.0625 + 0.125 + 0.0625 = 0.25$\nSince $V_E=0$, we have $V_P = V_G = 0.25$.\n\nNow we calculate the additive genetic variance, $V_A$. The formula is $V_A = 2pq\\alpha^2$, where $\\alpha$ is the average effect of allele substitution.\n$\\alpha = a + d(q-p)$\nUsing our derived values $a=0$, $d=1$, and the given frequencies $p=q=0.5$:\n$\\alpha = 0 + (1)(0.5 - 0.5) = 0$\nThe average effect of an allele substitution is exactly zero. This occurs because, at $p=q=0.5$, replacing an $a$ allele with an $A$ allele is equally likely to occur in an $a$ gamete (forming $Aa$) or an $A$ gamete (forming $AA$). The change in phenotype from the population mean is positive in one case ($Aa$ vs $aa$) and negative in the other ($AA$ vs $Aa$), and these effects cancel out perfectly.\nWith $\\alpha=0$, the additive variance is:\n$V_A = 2(0.5)(0.5)(0)^2 = 0$\n\nThe dominance variance, $V_D$, is given by the formula $V_D = (2pqd)^2$.\n$V_D = (2(0.5)(0.5)(1))^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n\nWe verify that $V_G = V_A + V_D = 0 + 0.25 = 0.25$, which is consistent with our direct calculation of $V_G$.\n\nFinally, we compute the heritabilities:\n$h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} = \\frac{0}{0.25} = 0$\n$H^2 = \\frac{V_G}{V_P} = \\frac{0.25}{0.25} = 1$\n\nThe calculations confirm that for this specific genetic architecture (pure overdominance) and allele frequencies ($p=q=0.5$), the additive genetic variance is zero. Thus, narrow-sense heritability is zero. The existence of a causal genetic effect is reflected in the fact that the total genetic variance $V_G$ is non-zero, leading to a broad-sense heritability of $H^2=1$ (since $V_E=0$). The variance is entirely due to dominance.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. Under pure overdominance at $p=q=0.5$, the average effect of allele substitution is $0$, so the additive genetic variance is $0$ while the total genetic variance is positive; therefore narrow-sense heritability is near $0$ even though broad-sense heritability is high.\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the results derived above. The system is pure overdominance. At $p=q=0.5$, the average effect of substitution $\\alpha$ is $0$. This makes $V_A=0$ and thus $h^2=0$. The total genetic variance $V_G$ is positive ($V_G=0.25$), so broad-sense heritability $H^2=1$ is high. This correctly reconciles the observations.\n**Correct.**\n\nB. Heritability, by definition, captures any causal genetic influence, so any sizable experimental genetic effect implies $h^2$ close to $1$; the near-zero slope must contradict basic population genetics.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It conflates heritability in the broad sense ($H^2$) with narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$). Only $h^2$ relates to parent-offspring resemblance and the response to selection. A sizable genetic effect does not imply a high $h^2_$; it only implies a high $H^2$. The case in the problem, where a large genetic effect from dominance results in $h^2=0$, is a direct counterexample. The near-zero slope is a prediction of, not a contradiction to, population genetics for this scenario.\n**Incorrect.**\n\nC. The low parent–offspring resemblance arises only because environmental variance is large; without environmental variance, heritability from any genetic architecture cannot be near $0$.\nThis statement is false on two counts. First, the problem explicitly states $V_E=0$. The low resemblance is due to genetic architecture, not environment. Second, the assertion that heritability cannot be near zero without environmental variance is proven false by the very calculation performed for this problem, where $h^2=0$ despite $V_E=0$. As long as a trait is genetically determined, $h^2$ can be zero if all genetic variance is non-additive (dominance or epistatic).\n**Incorrect.**\n\nD. Because the trait is binary at the genotype level, the concept of heritability does not apply, so no reconciliation is possible.\nThis statement demonstrates a misunderstanding of the applicability of quantitative genetics. The trait values are $0$ and $1$, which can be treated as measures on a quantitative scale. The entire framework of variance components and heritability can be, and routinely is, applied to such traits. The reconciliation is not only possible but is a standard textbook result, as shown in the derivation.\n**Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2695440"}]}
