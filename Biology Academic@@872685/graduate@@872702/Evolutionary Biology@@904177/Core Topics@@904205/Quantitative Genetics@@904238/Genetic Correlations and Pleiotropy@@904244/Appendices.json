The general definition for the correlation coefficient, $\\rho$, between any two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by their covariance divided by the product of their standard deviations:\n$$ \\rho_{XY} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}} $$\nIn the context of quantitative genetics, the traits $z_1$ and $z_2$ can be decomposed into additive genetic components (breeding values), which we denote as $A_1$ and $A_2$, and other components (dominance, epistasis, environment). The problem specifies that pleiotropy generates genetic covariances, and it is the additive components that are relevant for the response to selection. The genetic correlation $r_G$ is precisely the correlation between the breeding values of the two traits.\n\nThe given parameters are the additive genetic variances and covariance:\n$V_{A1} = \\mathrm{Var}(A_1) = 2.0$\n$V_{A2} = \\mathrm{Var}(A_2) = 1.0$\n$\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) = \\mathrm{Cov}(A_1, A_2) = -0.6$\n\nApplying the general definition of correlation to the breeding values $A_1$ and $A_2$, the genetic correlation $r_G$ is:\n$$ r_G = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(A_1, A_2)}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(A_1)} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(A_2)}} $$\nBy substituting the standard notation from the problem statement, we derive the expression for the genetic correlation:\n$$ r_G = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2)}{\\sqrt{V_{A1} V_{A2}}} $$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $r_G$ using the provided data: $V_{A1} = 2.0$, $V_{A2} = 1.0$, and $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) = -0.6$.\n$$ r_G = \\frac{-0.6}{\\sqrt{2.0 \\times 1.0}} = \\frac{-0.6}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nTo express this in simplest radical form, we convert the decimal to a fraction, $-0.6 = -\\frac{6}{10} = -\\frac{3}{5}$.\n$$ r_G = \\frac{-3/5}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{3}{5\\sqrt{2}} $$\nRationalizing the denominator gives:\n$$ r_G = -\\frac{3 \\times \\sqrt{2}}{5\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{5 \\times 2} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{10} $$\n\nFinally, we explain the consequence of the sign of $r_G$ using the conceptual framework of the multivariate breeder's equation. The equation describes the vector of evolutionary responses, $\\Delta\\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, as the product of the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{G}$, and the selection gradient vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} $$\nFor the two traits $z_1$ and $z_2$, this is written as:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta\\bar{z}_1 \\\\ \\Delta\\bar{z}_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} V_{A1}  \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2)  V_{A2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe problem states that directional selection acts to increase the mean of $z_1$, implying a positive selection gradient $\\beta_1 > 0$. There is no direct selection on $z_2$, which means its selection gradient is zero, $\\beta_2 = 0$. Substituting these conditions into the equation yields the responses for each trait:\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{z}_1 = V_{A1} \\beta_1 + \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\times 0 = V_{A1} \\beta_1 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{z}_2 = \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\beta_1 + V_{A2} \\times 0 = \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\beta_1 $$\nThe response in $z_1$ is the direct response to selection, and since $V_{A1} > 0$ and $\\beta_1 > 0$, $\\Delta\\bar{z}_1$ is positive, as expected. The response in $z_2$ is the correlated response, $\\Delta\\bar{z}_2$, and its direction is determined by the sign of the genetic covariance, $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2)$, as $\\beta_1$ is positive.\n\nFrom our derived formula, $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) = r_G \\sqrt{V_{A1} V_{A2}}$. The term $\\sqrt{V_{A1} V_{A2}}$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the sign of the covariance is identical to the sign of the genetic correlation $r_G$. Consequently, the sign of the correlated response $\\Delta\\bar{z}_2$ is determined by the sign of $r_G$.\nIn our case, $r_G$ is negative ($r_G = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{10}$). This implies that a negative genetic covariance exists between the traits, which is indicative of a genetic trade-off. When selection acts to increase the mean of trait $z_1$ (positive $\\beta_1$), the correlated response in trait $z_2$ will be negative:\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{z}_2 = \\mathrm{Cov}_A(z_1, z_2) \\beta_1  0 $$\nThus, the mean of trait $z_2$ is predicted to decrease.

After the selection on $X$ is abruptly relaxed at generation $t=0$, the correlated response in $Y$ is observed to decline rapidly over subsequent generations in a large, randomly mating population with non-overlapping generations. Assume no further selection, mutation, migration, or genetic drift after $t=0$.\n\nConsider a minimal additive genetic model with two biallelic loci.

Express your answer as a number of generations.", "solution": "A correlated response to selection on a trait $X$ is an evolutionary change in the mean of a second trait, $Y$, which is itself not under direct selection. This phenomenon is mediated by the additive genetic covariance, $C_{XY}$, between the two traits. The fundamental causes for such a covariance are two-fold: pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium.\n\n1.  **Pleiotropy**: This is the case where a single gene has a direct causal influence on multiple, distinct traits. If a gene affects both trait $X$ and trait $Y$, any selection pressure that alters the frequency of alleles at this gene's locus will inevitably cause a change in both traits. The genetic covariance arising from pleiotropy is a direct consequence of the gene's physiological function. It is a \"hard-wired\" property. Upon relaxation of selection on trait $X$, the force driving allele frequency change is removed, and the correlated response ceases. However, the underlying pleiotropic covariance structure itself does not degrade; it remains a static property of the gene, ready to mediate a correlated response should selection resume.\n\n2.  **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)**: This is a statistical, non-random association of alleles at two or more different loci. In the context of this problem, one locus ($\\mathcal{A}$) affects trait $X$ and a separate locus ($\\mathcal{B}$) affects trait $Y$. There is no pleiotropy. A genetic covariance can still exist if there is LD between these loci. For instance, if selection on trait $X$ has favored allele $A_1$, and by historical chance or selection on multi-locus genotypes, $A_1$ is frequently found on the same chromosome as allele $B_1$, then selection for $A_1$ will inadvertently increase the frequency of $B_1$, causing a change in trait $Y$. The LD is the statistical glue binding the evolutionary fates of the two traits.\n\nThe crucial distinction lies in the stability of these two mechanisms. Pleiotropy is a stable, structural property. Linkage disequilibrium, however, is a transient statistical association. In a randomly mating population, the process of recombination acts to break down LD. During meiosis, crossing over between loci shuffles alleles, creating non-parental haplotype combinations. This process systematically reduces the magnitude of LD in each generation. The rate of this decay is governed by the recombination fraction, $r$, between the loci.\n\nWhen selection on trait $X$ is relaxed at generation $t=0$, the force that built up and maintained the LD is removed. Recombination then becomes the dominant evolutionary force acting on the association between the loci. It relentlessly dismantles the LD, causing it to decay exponentially toward zero. As the additive genetic covariance in this model is directly proportional to the LD, $C_{XY}$ also decays. The observation of a \"rapidly disappearing\" correlated response is the macroscopic signature of this underlying microscopic process of recombination eroding the statistical association between the loci. Such a dynamic decay is not expected if the covariance is due to pleiotropy. Therefore, a rapidly decaying correlated response upon relaxation of selection is strong evidence that the genetic correlation was mediated by linkage disequilibrium rather than pleiotropy.\n\nNow, we proceed with the mathematical derivation.\n\nLet the alleles at locus $\\mathcal{A}$ be $A_1, A_2$ with frequencies $p_1, p_2$. Let the alleles at locus $\\mathcal{B}$ be $B_1, B_2$ with frequencies $q_1, q_2$. The four haplotype frequencies are denoted as $x_1$ ($A_1B_1$), $x_2$ ($A_1B_2$), $x_3$ ($A_2B_1$), and $x_4$ ($A_2B_2$). Linkage disequilibrium, $D$, is defined as the deviation of the frequency of the $A_1B_1$ haplotype from its expectation under random association: $D = x_1 - p_1 q_1$.\n\nIn a population with random mating, non-overlapping generations, and no selection, the haplotype frequencies in the next generation (denoted by a prime) are determined by the frequencies in the current generation and the recombination fraction, $r$. The frequency of the $A_1B_1$ haplotype in the next generation, $x'_1$, is the sum of the frequency of non-recombinant $A_1B_1$ gametes and recombinant gametes formed by the union of an $A_1$ allele and a $B_1$ allele from different parental chromosomes.\n$$x'_1 = (1-r)x_1 + r p_1 q_1$$\nThe LD in the next generation, $D'$, is defined as $D' = x'_1 - p'_1 q'_1$. In the absence of selection, allele frequencies are constant, so $p'_1 = p_1$ and $q'_1 = q_1$.\nSubstituting the expression for $x'_1$:\n$$D' = [(1-r)x_1 + r p_1 q_1] - p_1 q_1 = (1-r)x_1 - p_1 q_1 + r p_1 q_1 = (1-r)x_1 - (1-r)p_1 q_1$$\n$$D' = (1-r)(x_1 - p_1 q_1) = (1-r)D$$\nThis is the fundamental recursion for the decay of LD. If $D_t$ is the LD at generation $t$, then $D_t = (1-r)D_{t-1}$. Solving this recursion from an initial state $D_0$ at $t=0$ yields:\n$$D_t = D_0 (1-r)^t$$\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the additive genetic covariance $C_{XY}(t)$ and the linkage disequilibrium $D_t$. The problem states \"additive allelic effect $a$\". We interpret this as the average effect of an allele substitution at that locus, which we denote $\\alpha_X=a$ for trait $X$ at locus $\\mathcal{A}$, and $\\alpha_Y=b$ for trait $Y$ at locus $\\mathcal{B}$. The additive genetic covariance between two traits caused by linkage disequilibrium between two non-pleiotropic loci is given by the product of their substitution effects and the LD coefficient:\n$$C_{XY} = abD$$\nThis confirms that the covariance is directly proportional to the linkage disequilibrium. The time dependence of the covariance is therefore determined by the time dependence of LD:\n$$C_{XY}(t) = abD_t = abD_0(1-r)^t$$\nSince the initial covariance is $C_{XY}(0) = abD_0$, we have the relation:\n$$C_{XY}(t) = C_{XY}(0)(1-r)^t$$\nWe are asked to find the time $t_{0.1}$ required for the covariance to fall to one tenth of its initial value. We must solve the equation:\n$$C_{XY}(t_{0.1}) = 0.1 C_{XY}(0)$$\n$$C_{XY}(0)(1-r)^{t_{0.1}} = 0.1 C_{XY}(0)$$\nAssuming a nonzero initial covariance (i.e., $D_0 \\neq 0$), we divide by $C_{XY}(0)$:\n$$(1-r)^{t_{0.1}} = 0.1$$\nTo solve for $t_{0.1}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$t_{0.1} \\ln(1-r) = \\ln(0.1)$$\n$$t_{0.1} = \\frac{\\ln(0.1)}{\\ln(1-r)}$$\nThis is the general expression for the number of generations required for the LD-based covariance to decay to $10\\%$ of its initial value.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given recombination fraction $r = 0.01$:\n$$t_{0.1} = \\frac{\\ln(0.1)}{\\ln(1 - 0.01)} = \\frac{\\ln(0.1)}{\\ln(0.99)}$$\nUsing computational tools, we find:\n$$t_{0.1} \\approx \\frac{-2.30258509...}{-0.01005033...} \\approx 229.10344$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe number of generations is $229$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{229}\n$$", "id": "2698943"}]}
