Specifically, locus $A$ carries alleles $a_{0}$ (ancestral) and $a_{1}$ (derived), and locus $B$ carries alleles $b_{0}$ (ancestral) and $b_{1}$ (derived). Line $1$ is fixed for genotype $a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{0}b_{0}$ and line $2$ is fixed for genotype $a_{0}a_{0}\\,b_{1}b_{1}$. These lines are crossed to produce the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$, and then $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ individuals are randomly intercrossed to form the $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$.\n\nAssume standard Mendelian segregation, random mating, no segregation distortion, no viability or fertility selection prior to zygote formation, and a recombination fraction $r$ between loci $A$ and $B$, with $0 \\le r \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}$. The Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibility is expressed only in the double-homozygote genotype $a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{1}b_{1}$.\n\nUsing only first principles of Mendelian genetics and the definition of the recombination fraction between two loci, derive the expected $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$ zygotic frequency of the incompatible genotype $a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{1}b_{1}$ that results from an $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ intercross of the above parental lines.

No rounding is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution from first principles of genetics. The problem is therefore deemed valid. The derivation proceeds in three steps: determining the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ genotype, calculating the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ gamete frequencies, and calculating the $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$ zygotic frequency of the incompatible genotype.\n\nStep 1: Determine the Genotype of the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ Generation.\nThe parental cross is between two homozygous lines: Line $1$ with genotype $a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{0}b_{0}$ and Line $2$ with genotype $a_{0}a_{0}\\,b_{1}b_{1}$.\nLine $1$ can only produce gametes of a single type: $a_{1}b_{0}$.\nLine $2$ can only produce gametes of a single type: $a_{0}b_{1}$.\nThe fusion of these gametes produces the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ generation. All individuals in the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ generation are therefore dihybrid, with the genotype $a_{1}a_{0}\\,b_{1}b_{0}$.\nCritically, the alleles are in repulsion (or trans) phase. This means the haplotype inherited from Line $1$ is $a_{1}b_{0}$ and the haplotype inherited from Line $2$ is $a_{0}b_{1}$.\n\nStep 2: Determine Gamete Frequencies from the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ Intercross.\nThe $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ individuals with genotype $a_{1}a_{0}\\,b_{1}b_{0}$ produce four types of gametes. The frequencies of these gametes are determined by the recombination fraction, $r$, between locus $A$ and locus $B$. The recombination fraction is defined as the proportion of gametes that are of recombinant types.\nThe parental (non-recombinant) haplotypes are $a_{1}b_{0}$ and $a_{0}b_{1}$.\nThe recombinant haplotypes, formed by a crossover event between the two loci during meiosis, are $a_{1}b_{1}$ and $a_{0}b_{0}$.\n\nThe total frequency of non-recombinant gametes is $1-r$. By the principle of segregation, the two non-recombinant gamete types are produced in equal numbers. Thus, the frequency of each non-recombinant gamete is:\n$$f(a_{1}b_{0}) = f(a_{0}b_{1}) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$$\n\nThe total frequency of recombinant gametes is $r$. Similarly, the two recombinant gamete types are produced in equal numbers. Thus, the frequency of each recombinant gamete is:\n$$f(a_{1}b_{1}) = f(a_{0}b_{0}) = \\frac{r}{2}$$\nThe sum of all gamete frequencies is $(\\frac{1-r}{2}) + (\\frac{1-r}{2}) + (\\frac{r}{2}) + (\\frac{r}{2}) = (1-r) + r = 1$, as required.\n\nStep 3: Determine the Zygotic Frequency of the Incompatible Genotype in the $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$ Generation.\nThe $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$ generation is formed by the random intercross of $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ individuals. Under the assumption of random mating, this is equivalent to the random union of gametes from the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ gamete pool. The problem asks for the expected zygotic frequency of the incompatible genotype $a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{1}b_{1}$.\n\nThis specific genotype can only be formed by the fusion of an $a_{1}b_{1}$ gamete from one parent and an $a_{1}b_{1}$ gamete from the other parent. The frequency of a zygote is the product of the frequencies of the constituent gametes.\nLet $f(a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{1}b_{1})$ be the frequency of the incompatible zygote.\n$$f(a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{1}b_{1}) = f(a_{1}b_{1}) \\times f(a_{1}b_{1})$$\nSubstituting the frequency for the $a_{1}b_{1}$ gamete derived in Step 2:\n$$f(a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{1}b_{1}) = \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right) = \\frac{r^{2}}{4}$$\nThis expression gives the expected zygotic frequency of the genotype $a_{1}a_{1}\\,b_{1}b_{1}$ in the $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$ generation as a function of the recombination fraction $r$. Note that this frequency is $0$ for completely linked loci ($r=0$) and reaches its maximum of $\\frac{(1/2)^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ for unlinked loci ($r = \\frac{1}{2}$), consistent with expectations from Mendelian genetics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r^{2}}{4}}$$", "id": "2693766"}, {"introduction": "The BDM model is not a monolithic concept; the specific genetic details of an incompatibility profoundly influence its evolutionary consequences.

This final practice moves from the genetics of individual crosses to the dynamics of populations, modeling a scenario where two demes have fixed different adaptive alleles that are incompatible [@problem_id:2693790]. Your challenge is to determine the critical threshold of migration below which the incompatibility is strong enough to maintain divergence, providing a direct link between the strength of an epistatic interaction and its efficacy as a mechanism of reproductive isolation.", "problem": "Two large, randomly mating diploid populations (deme 1 and deme 2) exchange individuals symmetrically at migration rate $m$ per generation. Adaptation occurs at two unlinked loci, $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, each with an ancestral allele ($a$ at $L_{1}$, $b$ at $L_{2}$) and a derived allele ($A$ at $L_{1}$, $B$ at $L_{2}$). Both populations experience identical selection pressures favoring the derived state at each locus. Assume the following fitness scheme:\n- The baseline Wrightian fitness of the double-ancestral genotype $a/a;\\,b/b$ is $1$.\n- The direct effect of each derived allele is codominant and additive across loci: each copy of a derived allele contributes an additive fitness benefit of $s/2$, so that, for example, $A/A;\\,b/b$ has fitness $1+s$, $a/a;\\,B/B$ has fitness $1+s$, and $A/A;\\,B/B$ has fitness $1+2s$ in the absence of epistasis.\n- A Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (BDMI) operates between the derived alleles at $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$: any genotype carrying at least one copy of $A$ and at least one copy of $B$ pays an epistatic fitness cost. This epistatic cost is partially dominant in heterozygotes as follows. Let $d_{1} \\in \\{0,h,1\\}$ denote the contribution of $L_{1}$ to the expression of the BDMI, taking value $0$ if $A$ is absent at $L_{1}$, $h \\in [0,1]$ if the genotype is $A/a$, and $1$ if the genotype is $A/A$. Define $d_{2}$ analogously for $L_{2}$. The BDMI imposes a multiplicative fitness penalty of $\\varepsilon d_{1} d_{2}$, with $\\varepsilon0$.\n- There is free recombination between $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, and linkage disequilibrium can be ignored to first order when an allele is rare.\n\nSuppose a mutational-order divergence has occurred: deme $1$ is fixed for $A$ at $L_{1}$ and $b$ at $L_{2}$, while deme $2$ is fixed for $a$ at $L_{1}$ and $B$ at $L_{2}$. Because both demes face the same selection pressures, the direct selective advantage of $A$ and $B$ is identical ($s$), and the divergent fixation arose by historical contingency rather than environmental differences.\n\nTreating migration as weak and working to first order in the frequency of the rare immigrant allele in each deme, derive the maximum symmetric migration rate $m_{\\max}$ such that the alternative fixation state (deme $1$ fixed for $A$ at $L_{1}$ and $b$ at $L_{2}$; deme $2$ fixed for $a$ at $L_{1}$ and $B$ at $L_{2}$) is locally stable against invasion by the alternative derived allele from the other deme. Express $m_{\\max}$ as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the BDMI cost $\\varepsilon$ and the dominance parameter $h$. No numerical approximation is required, and no units are to be reported.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum symmetric migration rate, $m_{\\max}$, for which a state of divergence between two demes is locally stable. The state is defined by deme $1$ being fixed for genotype $A/A; b/b$ and deme $2$ being fixed for genotype $a/a; B/B$. We must determine the condition under which this geographic differentiation is maintained against the homogenizing effect of migration.\n\nThe stability of this configuration depends on the fitness of hybrids formed when individuals migrate between demes. Let us analyze the consequence of a migration event. An individual from deme $2$, with genotype $a/a; B/B$, migrates to deme $1$. In deme $1$, which is populated by individuals of genotype $A/A; b/b$, the migrant will mate with a resident. This mating constitutes a cross between an $a/a; B/B$ individual and an $A/A; b/b$ individual. All first-generation ($F_1$) offspring from this cross will have the genotype $A/a; B/b$.\n\nTo assess the fate of the migrant genes, we must first calculate the fitness of these $F_1$ hybrids relative to the resident population. The fitness is determined by the additive effects of the derived alleles ($A$ and $B$) and the epistatic incompatibility between them.\n\nFirst, let us establish the fitness of the resident genotypes. In deme $1$, residents are $A/A; b/b$. According to the problem, the fitness benefit is additive, with each derived allele contributing $s/2$. The genotype $A/A; b/b$ has two copies of allele $A$ and zero copies of allele $B$. The fitness, $W_{\\text{res,1}}$, is:\n$$W_{\\text{res,1}} = 1 + 2 \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) + 0 \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) = 1+s$$\nDue to the symmetry of the model, the fitness of residents in deme $2$, which have genotype $a/a; B/B$, is also:\n$$W_{\\text{res,2}} = 1 + 0 \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) + 2 \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) = 1+s$$\nWe can denote the resident fitness in either deme as $W_{\\text{res}} = 1+s$.\n\nNext, we calculate the fitness of the $F_1$ hybrid genotype, $A/a; B/b$.\nThe additive component of fitness for this genotype, which has one copy of allele $A$ and one copy of allele $B$, is:\n$$W_{\\text{additive}} = 1 + 1 \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) + 1 \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right) = 1+s$$\nThe problem states there is a multiplicative fitness penalty due to the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (BDMI). The penalty is given by $\\varepsilon d_1 d_2$. For the $A/a; B/b$ genotype:\n- At locus $L_1$, the genotype is $A/a$, so the contribution to the incompatibility is $d_1 = h$.\n- At locus $L_2$, the genotype is $B/b$, so the contribution to the incompatibility is $d_2 = h$.\nThe total epistatic penalty term is $\\varepsilon h^2$.\nThe total fitness of the $F_1$ hybrid, $W_{F1}$, is the product of the fitness without epistasis and the multiplicative penalty term $(1 - \\varepsilon h^2)$:\n$$W_{F1} = (1+s)(1-\\varepsilon h^2)$$\n\nThe local stability of the divergent state against invasion depends on selection acting against these initial hybrids. If hybrids have lower fitness than residents, selection will act to purge the immigrant alleles. The strength of this selection is captured by the selection coefficient against the hybrids, $s_d$. This is defined as the fractional reduction in fitness of the hybrid relative to the resident.\n$$s_d = 1 - \\frac{W_{F1}}{W_{\\text{res}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $W_{F1}$ and $W_{\\text{res}}$:\n$$s_d = 1 - \\frac{(1+s)(1-\\varepsilon h^2)}{1+s} = 1 - (1-\\varepsilon h^2) = \\varepsilon h^2$$\nCrucially, the selection coefficient against the $F_1$ hybrids, $s_d = \\varepsilon h^2$, is independent of the direct selective advantage, $s$. This is because the additive fitness component $(1+s)$ is present in both the resident and the $F_1$ hybrid fitness expressions, and thus cancels when calculating their relative fitness. The barrier to gene flow is created purely by the epistatic incompatibility.\n\nThe system of two demes will remain genetically differentiated if the force of selection purging the hybrids is stronger than the rate of migration introducing them. In island models of this type, the condition for the maintenance of divergence (i.e., for the local stability of the established state) is that the migration rate must be less than the selection coefficient against hybrids.\n$$m  s_d$$\nIf migration is stronger than this ($m  s_d$), the selective barrier is insufficient to prevent the two populations from merging into a single, homogeneous population. The alternative fixation state is therefore locally stable as long as the migration rate does not exceed the strength of selection against the $F_1$ hybrids.\n\nThe maximum migration rate, $m_{\\max}$, for which this stability is maintained is the point where the inequality becomes an equality:\n$$m_{\\max} = s_d$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $s_d$:\n$$m_{\\max} = \\varepsilon h^2$$\nThis result is a closed-form expression in terms of the BDMI cost parameter $\\varepsilon$ and the dominance parameter $h$, as required by the problem. It represents the critical migration threshold below which the reproductive isolation caused by the BDMI is effective at maintaining population divergence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\varepsilon h^{2}}$$", "id": "2693790"}]}
