When two gametes of opposite mating types fuse, they form a zygote of size $z$ equal to the sum of the sizes of the two fusing gametes. Zygote viability is an increasing, strictly concave function of zygote size given by $g(z)=1-\\exp(-k z)$ with $k0$.

It is a canonical model in theoretical evolutionary biology regarding the evolution of anisogamy. The premises are scientifically grounded within the context of mathematical modeling, the definitions are clear, and the data provided are complete and consistent for the task. The problem is well-posed and requires a rigorous derivation, not speculation.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fitness of a focal adult, $W$, is defined as the number of gametes it produces multiplied by the viability of the zygotes these gametes form.\n\nFirst, we compute the fitness of a resident adult, $W_{\\text{res}}$.\nA resident adult has a reproductive budget of $R=1$ and produces gametes of size $s=0.5$.\nThe number of gametes produced by a resident is $N_{\\text{res}} = \\frac{R}{s} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$.\nIn the resident isogamous population, a resident gamete of size $s$ fuses with another resident gamete of size $s$.\nThe resulting zygote size is $z_{\\text{res}} = s + s = 2s = 2(0.5) = 1$.\nThe viability of this zygote is given by the function $g(z_{\\text{res}})$, which is $g(1) = 1 - \\exp(-k(1)) = 1 - \\exp(-k)$.\nThe fitness of the resident adult is the product of the number of gametes and the viability of the resulting zygotes:\n$$W_{\\text{res}} = N_{\\text{res}} \\times g(z_{\\text{res}}) = 2 \\left(1 - \\exp(-k)\\right)$$\n\nNext, we compute the fitness of a rare mutant adult, $W_{\\text{mut}}$.\nA mutant adult has the same reproductive budget $R=1$ but produces gametes of size $s'=0.2$.\nThe number of gametes produced by a mutant is $N_{\\text{mut}} = \\frac{R}{s'} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5$.\nBecause the mutant is rare, its gametes almost always fuse with gametes from the abundant resident population, which are of size $s=0.5$.\nThe resulting zygote size is $z_{\\text{mut}} = s' + s = 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.7$.\nThe viability of this zygote is $g(z_{\\text{mut}}) = g(0.7) = 1 - \\exp(-k(0.7)) = 1 - \\exp(-0.7k)$.\nThe fitness of the mutant adult is:\n$$W_{\\text{mut}} = N_{\\text{mut}} \\times g(z_{\\text{mut}}) = 5 \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.7k)\\right)$$\n\nThe relative fitness of the rare mutant, $W_{\\text{rel}}$, is the ratio of the mutant's fitness to the resident's fitness:\n$$W_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{mut}}}{W_{\\text{res}}} = \\frac{5 \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.7k)\\right)}{2 \\left(1 - \\exp(-k)\\right)}$$\nThis simplifies to the required closed-form analytic expression in terms of $k$:\n$$W_{\\text{rel}} = 2.5 \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.7k)}{1 - \\exp(-k)}$$\n\nNow, we must determine if selection favors or disfavors the rare mutant. The mutant is favored if $W_{\\text{rel}}  1$, and disfavored if $W_{\\text{rel}}  1$. We must determine the sign of $W_{\\text{rel}} - 1$ for all $k0$.\nThe condition $W_{\\text{rel}}  1$ is equivalent to:\n$$2.5 \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.7k)}{1 - \\exp(-k)}  1$$\nSince $k0$, the denominator $1 - \\exp(-k)$ is positive. Thus, we can multiply both sides by it without changing the inequality direction:\n$$2.5 \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.7k)\\right)  1 - \\exp(-k)$$\n$$2.5 - 2.5\\exp(-0.7k)  1 - \\exp(-k)$$\n$$1.5  2.5\\exp(-0.7k) - \\exp(-k)$$\nLet us analyze the function $h(k) = 2.5(1 - \\exp(-0.7k)) - (1 - \\exp(-k))$ for $k0$.\n$$h(k) = 1.5 - 2.5\\exp(-0.7k) + \\exp(-k)$$\nTo determine the sign of $h(k)$ for $k0$, we first evaluate it at $k=0$:\n$$h(0) = 1.5 - 2.5\\exp(0) + \\exp(0) = 1.5 - 2.5 + 1 = 0$$\nNext, we examine the derivative of $h(k)$ with respect to $k$:\n$$h'(k) = \\frac{d}{dk} \\left(1.5 - 2.5\\exp(-0.7k) + \\exp(-k)\\right) = -2.5(-0.7)\\exp(-0.7k) - \\exp(-k)$$\n$$h'(k) = 1.75\\exp(-0.7k) - \\exp(-k)$$\nWe check the sign of $h'(k)$ for $k0$.\n$h'(k)  0 \\iff 1.75\\exp(-0.7k)  \\exp(-k)$.\nSince both sides are positive, we can take the natural logarithm:\n$\\ln(1.75) - 0.7k  -k \\implies 0.3k  -\\ln(1.75)$.\nSince $1.75  1$, $\\ln(1.75)$ is positive. Thus, $-\\ln(1.75)$ is negative. The inequality $0.3k  \\text{negative number}$ is true for all $k0$.\nTherefore, $h'(k)  0$ for all $k0$.\nSince $h(0)=0$ and the function $h(k)$ is strictly increasing for all $k0$, it must be that $h(k)  0$ for all $k0$.\nThis proves that $W_{\\text{rel}}  1$ for any positive value of $k$.\n\nJustification from first principles: This model illustrates the disruptive selection that drives the evolution of anisogamy. The core mechanism is the trade-off between gamete size and number, coupled with a zygote viability function that exhibits diminishing marginal returns.\n1.  **Size-Number Trade-off**: Given a fixed reproductive budget $R$, producing smaller gametes (size $s'$) allows for a greater number of gametes ($N' = R/s'$) compared to larger gametes (size $s$, number $N=R/s$). The mutant ($s'=0.2$) has a numerical advantage of a factor $\\frac{s}{s'} = \\frac{0.5}{0.2} = 2.5$ over the resident ($s=0.5$).\n2.  **Diminishing Returns on Viability**: The zygote viability function $g(z)=1-\\exp(-kz)$ is strictly concave for $k0$ ($g''(z) = -k^2\\exp(-kz)  0$). This implies that each additional unit of resource invested into zygote size yields a progressively smaller increase in viability. The viability gain from increasing zygote size from $0.7$ to $1.0$ is less than, for example, the gain from increasing it from $0$ to $0.3$.\nThe mutant strategy is to sacrifice some zygote viability for a large gain in gamete number. The resident strategy is to produce larger gametes, leading to more viable zygotes, but at the cost of producing fewer gametes.\nBecause of the diminishing returns (concavity of $g(z)$), the proportional loss in viability due to forming smaller zygotes ($z_{\\text{mut}}=0.7$ vs. $z_{\\text{res}}=1.0$) is less severe than the proportional gain in gamete number. A mutant's total reproductive output is $5$ zygotes of viability $g(0.7)$, while a resident's is $2$ zygotes of viability $g(1)$.\nThe mathematical proof confirms that the numerical advantage of the smaller gametes ($5$ vs $2$) always outweighs their viability disadvantage for any $k0$. This imbalance destabilizes the isogamous state, favoring any mutation that produces gametes smaller than the resident type. This process is the initial step toward the evolution of distinct male (small gamete) and female (large gamete) strategies.\nThe mutant is favored.\n\nConclusion: Selection favors the rare mutant.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.5 \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.7k)}{1 - \\exp(-k)}}\n$$", "id": "2707335"}, {"introduction": "Once anisogamy is established, the differing strategies of sperm and egg producers face distinct ecological challenges, particularly in broadcast spawning species.

The probability of fertilization, $P_{f}$, is $P(N \\ge 1)$. It is more direct to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is zero encounters ($N=0$), and subtract this from $1$.\n$$P_f = P(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N=0)$$\nUsing the Poisson formula for $k=0$:\n$$P(N=0) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^{0} \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{1} = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the rate $\\lambda = \\beta C_s$, we obtain the probability of zero encounters as a function of the given parameters:\n$$P(N=0) = \\exp(-\\beta C_s t)$$\nTherefore, the probability of fertilization is:\n$$P_f = 1 - \\exp(-\\beta C_s t)$$\nThis is the fertilization probability as a function of $t$, $\\beta$, and $C_s$.\n\nNext, we must determine the sperm concentration threshold $C_s^{\\ast}$ that results in a fertilization probability of $P_f = 0.5$.

This is the specific sperm concentration at which there is a $50\\%$ probability of egg fertilization within the characteristic time window $t$. If ambient sperm concentrations are consistently below this threshold, fertilization becomes a significant lottery, and reproductive success is severely hampered. This creates a strong selective pressure favoring strategies that increase the probability of fertilization. In the context of the evolution of anisogamy, this pressure is a primary driver. The strategy of producing large, resource-rich eggs (which are large targets but energetically costly and thus few in number) is only viable if they are likely to be fertilized. The corresponding strategy of producing immense numbers of small, motile sperm is an evolutionary solution to overcome sperm limitation, ensuring that the local concentration of sperm around an egg is high enough—ideally, well above $C_s^{\\ast}$—to guarantee high rates of fertilization. Therefore, $C_s^{\\ast}$ marks a critical point below which the anisogamous strategy faces a high risk of failure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.93 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "2707308"}, {"introduction": "Anisogamy's influence extends far beyond gamete dynamics, fundamentally shaping the landscape of sexual selection.
