{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The evolution of sterile worker castes, a hallmark of eusociality, presents a classic Darwinian puzzle: how can genes for altruistic suicide spread? The theoretical key is kin selection, elegantly summarized by Hamilton's rule, $rB > C$. This exercise provides a foundational application of this principle, tasking you with calculating the inclusive fitness budget for an actor in a haplodiploid system. By working through this calculation [@problem_id:2708185], you will gain a concrete understanding of how high genetic relatedness ($r$) between sisters can make the fitness benefit ($B$) given to a relative outweigh the personal reproductive cost ($C$) of sterility.", "problem": "A monogynous, monandrous haplodiploid colony (one queen, one mating) produces full sisters whose Wright’s coefficient of relatedness is $r=0.75$. Consider a rare, additive, weakly selected allele that is expressed only in heterozygous female carriers and causes them to adopt a sterile helper phenotype. Assume that the allele’s expression causes the actor to permanently forgo $C=1.2$ units of expected lifetime personal reproduction (measured in female reproductive equivalents) while increasing a single full sister’s expected lifetime reproduction by $B=2.0$ units via helping. There are no additional demographic or ecological feedbacks; all effects are marginal and additive; and population structure is otherwise constant so that relatedness $r$ captures the probability of identity by descent (IBD) between actor and recipient above the population mean.\n\nUsing inclusive-fitness accounting, compute the net marginal change in the expected number of IBD gene copies contributed to the next generation by an allele carrier who switches from independent reproduction to sterility and helping, given the values $r=0.75$, $B=2.0$, and $C=1.2$. Report this net change as a single real number, rounded to four significant figures. In your reasoning, indicate whether this sign implies that selection favors or disfavors the sterility allele and explain the biological meaning of that sign in the context of the evolution of eusociality. The final reported value must be unitless and contain no explanatory text.", "solution": "The appropriate foundational base is Hamilton’s inclusive fitness framework, which decomposes the effect of an actor’s phenotype on the expected transmission of gene copies into a direct component through the actor’s own reproduction and an indirect component through effects on the reproduction of social partners weighted by their coefficient of relatedness. Formally, under weak selection and additivity, the change in gene frequency is proportional to the change in inclusive fitness, which is the sum of the actor’s direct fitness effect plus the relatedness-weighted sum of effects on recipients.\n\nDefine $r$ as Wright’s coefficient of relatedness between actor and recipient, $B$ as the marginal increase in the recipient’s expected reproduction caused by the actor’s behavior, and $C$ as the marginal decrease in the actor’s own expected reproduction due to expressing the behavior. The inclusive-fitness change experienced by a rare allele when its carrier switches from independent reproduction to helping a single recipient is the indirect benefit to identical-by-descent (IBD) copies in the recipient minus the direct loss to the actor. Thus, the net marginal change in expected IBD gene copies contributed to the next generation is\n$$\n\\Delta W_{I} \\;=\\; r\\,B \\;-\\; C.\n$$\nThis expression follows from summing the direct component (a loss of $C$) and the indirect component (a gain of $rB$), where $r$ scales the recipient’s benefit into IBD gene copies attributable to the focal allele.\n\nSubstitute the given values $r=0.75$, $B=2.0$, and $C=1.2$:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{I} \\;=\\; (0.75)\\times(2.0)\\;-\\;1.2 \\;=\\; 1.5 \\;-\\; 1.2 \\;=\\; 0.3.\n$$\n\nBecause $\\Delta W_{I} = 0.3 > 0$, the sign is positive. Under weak selection, a positive $\\Delta W_{I}$ implies that selection favors the sterility-and-helping phenotype: the expected number of identical-by-descent gene copies transmitted indirectly through a full sister (weighted by $r=0.75$) more than compensates for the actor’s forfeited direct reproduction. Biologically, this means that in a haplodiploid system with high sister–sister relatedness, helping behavior that boosts a sister’s reproduction by $B=2.0$ at a personal cost of $C=1.2$ can be favored, illuminating one route by which eusociality (with worker sterility) can evolve.\n\nFinally, round the numerical value to four significant figures:\n$$\n0.3 \\;\\to\\; 0.3000.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3000}$$", "id": "2708185"}, {"introduction": "While high relatedness can favor cooperation, the genetic interests within a eusocial colony are rarely identical, creating the potential for intracolonial conflict. This is particularly pronounced in haplodiploid Hymenoptera, where relatedness asymmetries give rise to behaviors like worker policing. This problem [@problem_id:2708209] challenges you to explore the genetic logic behind this behavior by deriving it from the first principles of inheritance. You will determine how a key variable, the queen's mating frequency ($m$), alters the average relatedness within the colony and, consequently, dictates whether workers are selected to suppress each other's reproduction.", "problem": "Consider a haplodiploid eusocial insect with a single queen who mates with $m$ distinct, unrelated males. Assume that paternity among workers is equally partitioned among the $m$ males, there is no inbreeding, and that any worker who lays an egg is equally likely to come from any patriline. Males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid. Define genetic relatedness $r$ between an actor and a recipient as the probability that a randomly chosen gene copy in the recipient is identical by descent to a randomly chosen gene copy in the actor, relative to the population baseline.\n\nWorkers may police worker-laid eggs. Ignoring any direct costs or colony-level efficiency effects, suppose selection on worker policing is determined solely by whether a focal worker is, on average, more related to the queen’s sons (her brothers) than to worker-produced sons of other workers (her nephews). Using only the inheritance rules above and the definition of relatedness, and without invoking any pre-derived kinship shortcuts, perform the following:\n\n1. Derive the relatedness of a focal worker to a randomly chosen brother (a queen-produced male).\n2. Derive the relatedness of a focal worker to a randomly chosen nephew (a worker-produced male), averaging over whether the nephew’s mother is a full sister or a half sister of the focal worker, given $m$ and the assumptions stated.\n3. By comparing these two relatednesses, obtain the threshold queen mating number $m^{*}$ above which a focal worker is, on average, more related to a brother than to a nephew, making policing favored by this relatedness criterion.\n\nExpress your final answer for $m^{*}$ as a single exact integer with no units.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a threshold for the number of a queen's mates, $m$, which determines whether worker policing of worker-laid eggs is favored under a specific relatedness criterion. This analysis must be performed from first principles of genetic inheritance in a haplodiploid system, adhering strictly to the provided definition of relatedness. The system is haplodiploid, with diploid females and haploid males. The queen mates with $m$ distinct, unrelated males.\n\nThe definition of relatedness, $r$, between an actor and a recipient is given as the probability that a randomly chosen gene copy in the recipient is identical by descent (IBD) to a randomly chosen gene copy in the actor. We must compare the relatedness of a focal worker to her brother (a queen-produced male) with her average relatedness to a nephew (a worker-produced male).\n\nLet W be the focal worker (diploid actor), B be her brother (haploid recipient), and N be her nephew (haploid recipient). The queen is denoted Q, and the queen's mates (the fathers) are denoted $F_i$.\n\nFirst, we derive the relatedness of a worker to her brother, $r_{W \\rightarrow B}$.\nThe brother, B, is a son of the queen and develops from an unfertilized egg. Therefore, his entire haploid genome is a random sample of one of the queen's two homologous sets of chromosomes. Let $g_B$ be a randomly chosen gene from B; this gene comes from Q.\nThe worker, W, is diploid. A randomly chosen gene from her, $g_W$, comes from the queen with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and from her father with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTo calculate $r_{W \\rightarrow B}$, we find the probability that $g_W$ and $g_B$ are IBD. We sum the probabilities over the possible origins of $g_W$:\n$1$. The gene $g_W$ comes from the queen. This happens with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. In this case, both $g_W$ and $g_B$ are random draws from the queen's diploid genome. The probability that two such genes are IBD is $\\frac{1}{2}$, assuming the queen is not inbred. The contribution to total relatedness from this path is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n$2$. The gene $g_W$ comes from the father. This happens with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The brother's gene, $g_B$, comes from the queen. As the queen and her mates are unrelated, the probability of IBD between a paternal gene in the worker and a gene from the queen is $0$. The contribution from this path is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 0 = 0$.\nThe total relatedness is the sum of probabilities from these mutually exclusive paths:\n$$r_{W \\rightarrow B} = \\frac{1}{4} + 0 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the relatedness of a worker to her nephew, $r_{W \\rightarrow N}$.\nThe nephew, N, is the haploid son of another worker, let us call her W'. Because N develops from an unfertilized egg from W', his genome is identical to one of the two sets of genes in W'. This implies that the relatedness of the focal worker W to her nephew N is equal to her relatedness to the nephew's mother, W'.\n$$r_{W \\rightarrow N} = r_{W \\rightarrow W'}$$\nThe problem states that the egg-laying worker W' is chosen randomly from the colony. The focal worker W and the other worker W' share the same mother, Q. They are full sisters if they also share the same father, or half sisters if they have different fathers. Given $m$ males and equal paternity, the probability that W' has the same father as W is $\\frac{1}{m}$. The probability that W' has a different father is $\\frac{m-1}{m}$.\nThe average relatedness $r_{W \\rightarrow W'}$ is thus a weighted average:\n$$r_{W \\rightarrow W'} = \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) r_{\\text{full-sis}} + \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m}\\right) r_{\\text{half-sis}}$$\nWe must compute the relatedness for full sisters and half sisters.\nFor full sisters, who share mother Q and father F, the relatedness $r_{\\text{full-sis}}$ is calculated by picking a random gene from W and one from W'.\n- If the gene from W is maternal (from Q, probability $\\frac{1}{2}$), it has a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance of being IBD with a random gene from W' (as shown in the sister-brother calculation, it is the relatedness to a sibling through the mother). This path contributes $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n- If the gene from W is paternal (from F, probability $\\frac{1}{2}$), we compare it to a random gene from W'. This gene from W' is maternal with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ (IBD probability $0$) or paternal with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. If paternal, both genes come from the same haploid father F, so they are IBD with probability $1$. This path contributes $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSo, $r_{\\text{full-sis}} = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\nFor half sisters, who share mother Q but have different unrelated fathers $F_1$ and $F_2$, the calculation is similar.\n- The maternal path is identical, contributing $\\frac{1}{8}$ to the relatedness.\n- The paternal path involves genes from unrelated fathers, so their IBD probability is $0$. This path contributes $0$.\nSo, $r_{\\text{half-sis}} = \\frac{1}{8} + 0 = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nNow we can calculate the average relatedness to a nephew:\n$$r_{W \\rightarrow N} = \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\frac{3 + m - 1}{8m} = \\frac{m+2}{8m}$$\n\nThird, we find the threshold queen mating number $m^{*}$ above which policing is favored. This occurs when the relatedness to a brother is greater than the average relatedness to a nephew.\n$$r_{W \\rightarrow B} > r_{W \\rightarrow N}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\\frac{1}{4} > \\frac{m+2}{8m}$$\nSince $m$ is the number of mates, $m \\ge 1$; thus $8m$ is a positive value. We can multiply both sides of the inequality by $8m$ without changing its direction:\n$$2m > m+2$$\nSubtracting $m$ from both sides gives the condition:\n$$m > 2$$\nThis inequality indicates that worker policing is favored by the relatedness criterion when the queen mates with more than $2$ males. The threshold value $m^{*}$ is therefore $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2708209"}, {"introduction": "Kin selection explains the genetic incentive for altruism, but it does not, by itself, explain why group living is advantageous in the first place.
