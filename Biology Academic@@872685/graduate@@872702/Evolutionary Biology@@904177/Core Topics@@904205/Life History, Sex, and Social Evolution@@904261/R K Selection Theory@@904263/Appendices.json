A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\nTask 1: Computation of Demographic Parameters\n\nThe fundamental demographic parameters are the net reproductive rate, $R_0$, the cohort generation time, $T$, and the intrinsic rate of increase, $r$.\n\nThe net reproductive rate is defined as the average number of female offspring produced by a female over her lifetime:\n$$R_0 = \\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} l_x m_x$$\nThe cohort generation time is the mean age of mothers in a cohort at the time of offspring bearing:\n$$T = \\frac{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} x l_x m_x}{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} l_x m_x} = \\frac{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} x l_x m_x}{R_0}$$\nThe intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, is determined by the discrete-time Euler–Lotka equation, which relates population growth to the life history schedule:\n$$\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} l_x m_x \\exp(-r x) = 1$$\n\nThese parameters are now computed for each species.\n\nFor Species A:\nThis species exhibits semelparity with reproduction occurring only at age $x=1$. Therefore, the only non-zero term in the summations is for $x=1$.\nThe net reproductive rate is:\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{A}} = l_1 m_1 = \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) \\times 4 = \\frac{12}{10} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2$$\nThe cohort generation time is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot l_1 m_1}{R_{0, \\mathrm{A}}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{6}{5}} = 1 \\text{ year}$$\nThe intrinsic rate of increase $r_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is found using the Euler–Lotka equation, which simplifies for a semelparous organism:\n$$l_1 m_1 \\exp(-r_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot 1) = 1$$\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{A}} \\exp(-r_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 1 \\implies \\frac{6}{5} \\exp(-r_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 1$$\n$$\\exp(r_{\\mathrm{A}}) = \\frac{6}{5}$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) = \\ln(1.2) \\text{ per year}$$\n\nFor Species B:\nThis species is also semelparous, but with reproduction delayed until age $x=3$. The only non-zero term in the summations is for $x=3$.\nThe net reproductive rate is:\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{B}} = l_3 m_3 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{75}{32}\\right) = \\frac{64}{125} \\times \\frac{75}{32} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 32}{5 \\cdot 25} \\times \\frac{3 \\cdot 25}{32} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2$$\nThe cohort generation time is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot l_3 m_3}{R_{0, \\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{6}{5}} = 3 \\text{ years}$$\nThe intrinsic rate of increase $r_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is found from the simplified Euler–Lotka equation:\n$$l_3 m_3 \\exp(-r_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot 3) = 1$$\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{B}} \\exp(-3 r_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 1 \\implies \\frac{6}{5} \\exp(-3 r_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 1$$\n$$\\exp(3 r_{\\mathrm{B}}) = \\frac{6}{5}$$\n$$3 r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) \\implies r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(1.2) \\text{ per year}$$\n\nSummary of parameters:\n- Species A: $R_{0, \\mathrm{A}} = 1.2$, $T_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1$ year, $r_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\ln(1.2) \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\n- Species B: $R_{0, \\mathrm{B}} = 1.2$, $T_{\\mathrm{B}} = 3$ years, $r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(1.2) \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\n\nTask 2: Justification based on $r$-$K$ Selection Theory\n\nThe framework of $r$-$K$ selection describes two opposing strategies favored under different ecological conditions. $r$-selection favors traits that maximize the intrinsic rate of population increase ($r$), which is advantageous in unstable, sparsely populated environments. $K$-selection favors traits that enhance competitive ability and efficiency of resource use, which is advantageous in stable environments at or near the carrying capacity ($K$).\n\nComparison of the two species reveals a classic life history trade-off. Both species have the exact same net reproductive rate, $R_0 = 1.2$, meaning their lifetime reproductive output is identical. However, the timing of this reproduction differs dramatically, leading to different population growth dynamics.\n- Species A exhibits a strategy of early reproduction ($T_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1$) and low pre-reproductive survivorship ($l_1 = 0.3$). This leads to a high intrinsic rate of increase, $r_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\ln(1.2)$.\n- Species B exhibits a strategy of delayed reproduction ($T_{\\mathrm{B}} = 3$) but high pre-reproductive survivorship ($l_3 = (4/5)^3 \\approx 0.512$). This leads to a much lower intrinsic rate of increase, $r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(1.2)$. In fact, $r_{\\mathrm{A}} = 3 r_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n\nMechanistic Justification:\n- **Frequent disturbance (far below carrying capacity)**: This scenario constitutes an $r$-selecting environment. After a disturbance, empty patches become available for colonization. The critical factor for success is the speed at which a population can grow to occupy these patches. Species A, with its significantly higher intrinsic rate of increase ($r_\\mathrm{A}  r_\\mathrm{B}$), will exhibit much faster exponential growth. Its short generation time ($T_\\mathrm{A} = 1$) allows it to multiply rapidly, establishing a large population before Species B can complete a single generation. Therefore, Species A is the superior colonizer and would be favored under conditions of frequent disturbance. It is a classic $r$-strategist.\n\n- **Long-term stable, near-carrying-capacity conditions**: This scenario constitutes a $K$-selecting environment. The habitat is saturated, and population growth is limited by intense competition for resources. The ability to grow rapidly ($r$) is less important than the ability to survive and compete effectively. Species B's life history, characterized by high investment in survival to a later age of maturity, is indicative of a $K$-strategist. The high survivorship ($l_1 = 0.8$, $l_2 = 0.64$) implies adaptations for enduring competition, predation, and other density-dependent pressures. While Species A reproduces quickly, its low survivorship suggests it is poorly adapted to crowded conditions. In a competitive showdown at high density, the robust, high-survival individuals of Species B would out-persist and ultimately displace Species A. Thus, Species B would be favored in a stable, competitive environment.\n\nTask 3: Computation of $\\Delta r$\n\nThe final task is to compute the difference between the intrinsic rates of increase of the two species, $\\Delta r = r_{\\mathrm{A}} - r_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\nUsing the derived expressions for $r_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\ln(1.2)$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(1.2)$$\nThe difference is:\n$$\\Delta r = \\ln(1.2) - \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(1.2) = \\frac{2}{3} \\ln(1.2)$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we use the value of the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln(1.2) \\approx 0.18232155679$$\n$$\\Delta r \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.18232155679 \\approx 0.12154770452 \\text{ per year}$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta r \\approx 0.1215 \\text{ per year}$$\nThis quantity represents the substantial growth rate advantage of the $r$-strategist (Species A) over the $K$-strategist (Species B) in an environment free from density-dependent limitations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1215}$$", "id": "2811624"}, {"introduction": "Shifting our focus from growth in empty habitats to persistence in crowded ones, this exercise explores the core of $K$-selection: competitive ability, often measured by the equilibrium population size or carrying capacity, $K$. Using a stage-structured population model, you will derive an analytical expression for the equilibrium abundance of two distinct life-history strategies—one semelparous (single reproduction) and one iteroparous (repeated reproduction). This practice demonstrates mathematically how traits such as increased adult survival and iteroparity, which enhance persistence under density dependence, can lead to a higher carrying capacity and are thus favored in stable, competitive environments [@problem_id:2746899].", "problem": "Consider a closed, density-regulated population with a discrete-time, two-stage structure: juveniles $J_t$ and adults $A_t$ at time $t$.

Juveniles from time $t$ either survive density-dependent recruitment to the adult class at time $t+1$ with probability $s_J(N_t)$ or die; adults survive from time $t$ to time $t+1$ with probability $s_A$.

It describes a standard two-stage, discrete-time population model with density-dependent recruitment, a common framework in theoretical ecology. The task is a direct algebraic derivation based on the provided model structure. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe population dynamics are governed by a system of two discrete-time equations for the number of juveniles, $J_t$, and adults, $A_t$, at time $t$:\n$$\nJ_{t+1} = b A_t\n$$\n$$\nA_{t+1} = s_J(N_t) J_t + s_A A_t\n$$\nThe total population size is $N_t = J_t + A_t$. The density-dependent juvenile survival probability during recruitment is given by the function $s_J(N_t) = \\frac{s_0}{1 + \\alpha N_t}$, where $s_0 \\in (0,1]$ and $\\alpha  0$.\n\nTo find the nontrivial equilibrium abundances, we set the population state to be constant over time, i.e., $J_{t+1} = J_t = J^{\\ast}$ and $A_{t+1} = A_t = A^{\\ast}$. The system of equations at equilibrium is:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast} = b A^{\\ast} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nA^{\\ast} = s_J(N^{\\ast}) J^{\\ast} + s_A A^{\\ast} \\quad (2)\n$$\nwhere $N^{\\ast} = J^{\\ast} + A^{\\ast}$ is the total equilibrium abundance.\n\nFrom equation $(1)$, we observe that the ratio of juveniles to adults at equilibrium is determined by the fecundity parameter $b$. We can use this relationship to express the total equilibrium abundance $N^{\\ast}$ in terms of the adult abundance $A^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nN^{\\ast} = J^{\\ast} + A^{\\ast} = b A^{\\ast} + A^{\\ast} = (b+1) A^{\\ast}\n$$\nThis allows us to write the equilibrium abundances of each life stage as a fraction of the total equilibrium abundance:\n$$\nA^{\\ast} = \\frac{N^{\\ast}}{b+1}\n$$\n$$\nJ^{\\ast} = b A^{\\ast} = \\frac{b N^{\\ast}}{b+1}\n$$\nNext, we manipulate the equilibrium condition for adults, equation $(2)$, to solve for $N^{\\ast}$.
