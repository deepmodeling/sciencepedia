Let us denote them by $U$ and $V$. The taxon $A$ and the taxon $B$ are connected to node $U$. The taxon $C$ and the taxon $D$ are connected to node $V$. The internal edge connects nodes $U$ and $V$. The branch lengths are thus: $t_{AU} = t_{L}$, $t_{BU} = t_{S}$, $t_{CV} = t_{L}$, $t_{DV} = t_{S}$, and $t_{UV} = t_{I}$.\n\nWe wish to calculate the probability of the site pattern where $A=C$ and $B=D$, but $A \\neq B$. Let the two states be $0$ and $1$. The desired event is the union of two disjoint elementary events: $\\{S_A=0, S_C=0, S_B=1, S_D=1\\}$ and $\\{S_A=1, S_C=1, S_B=0, S_D=0\\}$, where $S_X$ is the state at taxon $X$.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the CFN model, where transition rates between states are equal and the stationary distribution is uniform, the probabilities of these two elementary events are identical. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of one and multiply by $2$.\nLet $P_{pattern} = P(S_A=C \\neq S_B=D) = 2 \\times P(S_A=0, S_C=0, S_B=1, S_D=1)$.\n\nTo compute this joint probability, we use the law of total probability, marginalizing over all possible states of the internal nodes $U$ and $V$.

An estimator of a tree topology is statistically consistent if, as the number of sites $n$ approaches infinity, the probability of inferring the true topology converges to $1$. We will analyze the consistency of Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) under the specified conditions.\n\nThe true tree is $T^{\\star} = ((A,B),(C,D))$. Due to the long branches $t_L$ leading to taxa $A$ and $C$, the phenomenon of long-branch attraction may cause an inference method to incorrectly group taxa $A$ and $C$ together, yielding the topology $T_{AC} = ((A,C),(B,D))$.\n\n**Analysis of Maximum Parsimony (MP)**\n\nMaximum Parsimony operates by selecting the tree topology that requires the minimum number of character-state changes to explain the observed data. In the asymptotic limit as $n \\to \\infty$, MP will converge to the topology supported by the largest number of parsimony-informative sites.\n\nA site is parsimony-informative for a quartet if it has at least two different character states, with each of these states appearing at least twice. For example, a site pattern of `GAGA` across taxa $(A,B,C,D)$ is informative. For this pattern, the topology $((A,C),(B,D))$ requires only one change, whereas the other two topologies, $((A,B),(C,D))$ and $((A,D),(B,C))$, require at least two changes. Thus, this pattern supports $((A,C),(B,D))$.\n\nThe Felsenstein zone is defined by branch lengths where $t_L$ is large and $t_I$ is small.\n- The probability of a change on a long branch is $p(t_L) = \\frac{3}{4}(1 - e^{-4\\mu t_L/3})$. As $t_L \\to \\infty$, $p(t_L) \\to 3/4$.\n- The probability of a change on the short internal branch is $p(t_I) = \\frac{3}{4}(1 - e^{-4\\mu t_I/3})$. As $t_I \\to 0$, $p(t_I) \\to 0$.\n\nLet us consider the expected number of sites supporting the true tree versus the incorrect tree grouping the long branches.\n- **Support for the true tree $T^{\\star} = ((A,B),(C,D))$**: The most direct evidence for this topology comes from a shared derived character (synapomorphy) for the clade $(A,B)$ or $(C,D)$. This requires a single substitution on the internal branch $t_I$. The probability of such an event is proportional to $p(t_I)$.\n- **Support for the incorrect tree $T_{AC} = ((A,C),(B,D))$**: This tree is supported by homoplasy, specifically parallel or convergent substitutions. For example, a site pattern supporting $T_{AC}$ can be generated on the true tree $T^{\\star}$ by two independent substitutions, one on the branch to $A$ and one on the branch to $C$. The probability of such a joint event is related to $p(t_L) \\times p(t_L) = p(t_L)^2$.\n\nIn the Felsenstein zone, $t_L$ is large and $t_I$ is small. Therefore, $p(t_L)$ is large (approaching $3/4$), and $p(t_I)$ is small (approaching $0$). It was proven by Felsenstein ($1978$) that there exists a region of parameter space where the expected number of sites supporting the incorrect tree $T_{AC}$ due to homoplasy exceeds the expected number of sites supporting the true tree $T^{\\star}$ due to synapomorphy. In this zone, $E[\\text{sites supporting } T_{AC}] > E[\\text{sites supporting } T^{\\star}]$.\n\nBy the law of large numbers, as $n \\to \\infty$, the observed frequencies of site patterns will converge to their expected frequencies. Consequently, MP will select the incorrect topology $T_{AC}$. This demonstrates that MP is statistically inconsistent under these conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Maximum Likelihood (ML)**\n\nMaximum Likelihood, when the generating model of evolution is correctly specified (as is the case here, with JC69), is a statistically consistent method. Consistency is guaranteed if the model is identifiable, meaning that different tree topologies cannot produce the exact same probability distribution of site patterns.\n\nFor the JC69 model on an unrooted four-taxon tree, the topology is identifiable. This means that for the true tree $T^{\\star}$ and any incorrect tree $T' \\neq T^{\\star}$, there is no set of branch lengths for $T'$ that can make the likelihood of the data under $(T', \\text{lengths}')$ equal to the likelihood of the data under $(T^{\\star}, \\text{true lengths})$ in expectation.\n\nThe principle of ML is based on maximizing the global likelihood function. The expected value of the log-likelihood is maximized at the true parameter values (topology and branch lengths). As $n \\to \\infty$, the sample log-likelihood function converges to its expected value. Therefore, the topology that maximizes the sample likelihood will converge in probability to the true topology $T^{\\star}$. ML correctly accounts for multiple substitutions on long branches and is not misled by homoplasy in the same way as MP. Thus, ML is statistically consistent, even in the Felsenstein zone.\n\n**Implications for Quartet-based Reconstruction**\n\nThe quartet paradigm relies on a \"quartet oracle\" to infer topologies, which are then assembled into a supertree. If the oracle is statistically inconsistent, it will produce systematically biased results.\n- Using MP as the oracle in a region of the true tree that has Felsenstein zone geometry will cause MP to consistently report the incorrect quartet topology $((A,C),(B,D))$.\n- This is not a random error that averages out. It is a systematic error. When the supertree algorithm receives a consistent but incorrect signal from all quartets spanning this part of the tree, it will be biased towards, or forced to reconstruct, an incorrect larger tree that reflects the grouping of long branches.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. There exist $t_{L} \\gg 0$ and $t_{I} \\approx 0$ such that, as $n \\to \\infty$, MP converges to the incorrect quartet that groups the long branches $A$ and $C$ together, whereas ML under the correctly specified JC69 model remains statistically consistent for the true quartet $T^{\\star}$. Consequently, using MP as the quartet oracle can bias a supertree toward incorrect resolutions in parts of the larger tree that instantiate such quartets.**\n- `MP converges to the incorrect quartet...`: As derived above, this is a correct statement describing the inconsistency of MP due to LBA.\n- `ML... remains statistically consistent...`: As derived above, this is also correct.\n- `Consequently, using MP as the quartet oracle can bias a supertree...`: This is the correct logical consequence of using a systematically biased method for sub-problem analysis. The errors are systematic and will corrupt the final supertree.\n- This statement is a complete and accurate description of the situation.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. As $n \\to \\infty$, long-branch attraction disappears for MP on quartets because homoplastic patterns average out, so both MP and ML are statistically consistent on $T^{\\star}$ regardless of $t_{L}$ and $t_{I}$.**\n- `long-branch attraction disappears for MP... as n -> infinity`: This is fundamentally false. LBA is precisely an asymptotic phenomenon; it describes the incorrect topology to which MP converges as data becomes infinite. Homoplastic patterns do not \"average out\" but rather systematically mislead the method.\n- `both MP and ML are statistically consistent... regardless of t_L and t_I`: This is false. MP is not generally consistent.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In the Felsenstein zone, both MP and ML are statistically inconsistent on quartets under JC69 because convergent substitutions dominate and render the tree topology unidentifiable for any method.**\n- `both MP and ML are statistically inconsistent`: False. ML with the correct model is consistent.\n- `render the tree topology unidentifiable`: False. The JC69 model on a quartet is identifiable. High rates of substitution make inference difficult (i.e., require more data), but they do not make the topology fundamentally unrecoverable for a consistent method. The problem is with the inference criterion (parsimony), not with the inherent identifiability of the model.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under the quartet paradigm, the choice between MP and ML is asymptotically irrelevant: even if the quartet oracle is statistically inconsistent on certain quartets, the redundancy across the $\\binom{N}{4}$ quartets ensures that the supertree is statistically consistent as $n \\to \\infty$.**\n- `the choice between MP and ML is asymptotically irrelevant`: False. Their asymptotic behaviors are fundamentally different (inconsistent vs. consistent). The choice is critical.\n- `redundancy... ensures that the supertree is statistically consistent`: False. The errors caused by LBA are systematic, not random. If a particular LBA-inducing geometry exists in the true N-taxon tree, all quartets that sample those branches will be incorrectly inferred in the same way.

This is an asymmetric tree highly susceptible to LBA if the outgroup branch is also long.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\nA. Under strategy $O_1$, MP consistency is guaranteed; the longer outgroup branch increases the number of unambiguous synapomorphies and therefore minimizes LBA risk.\n\nStrategy $O_1$ introduces an outgroup $O_1$ on a very long branch, $t_{O_1} = 2.00$. We now have two long, non-adjacent branches in the true tree: the one leading to $C$ ($t_C=1.80$) and the one leading to $O_1$ ($t_{O_1}=2.00$). They are separated by a very short internal branch ($t_I=0.05$). This is the canonical configuration that induces LBA. The large number of random, parallel changes on branches to $C$ and $O_1$ will create a strong, misleading signal that swamps the true phylogenetic signal carried by the small number of changes on the short internal branch. Instead of guaranteeing consistency, this strategy makes inconsistency virtually certain. The claim that a longer outgroup branch helps is a fundamental misunderstanding of LBA.\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\nB. Under strategy $O_2$, shortening the outgroup branch reduces the risk of LBA-driven misrooting relative to $O_1$ because it decreases the rate at which independent similarities arise between $C$ and the outgroup that MP would count as shared derived states.\n\nStrategy $O_2$ uses a close outgroup with a short branch length, $t_{O_2} = 0.15$. Compared to strategy $O_1$, this removes one of the two long branches from the LBA-inducing pair. While the branch to $C$ remains long ($t_C=1.80$), there is no other long branch for it to be \"attracted\" to. The outgroup branch is now short, so the number of random substitutions on it is small, drastically reducing the probability of convergent changes between the $C$ line and the outgroup line. The reasoning provided—that decreasing the branch length decreases the rate of independent similarities (homoplasy) that MP misinterprets—is precisely correct. This is the standard textbook solution to mitigate LBA caused by a distant outgroup.\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\nC. Under strategy $O_3$, using two close outgroups that form a clade further reduces LBA risk relative to a single close outgroup by breaking the outgroup-side path into multiple short branches, lowering the chance that the long ingroup branch to $C$ will be spuriously united with the outgroup.\n\nStrategy $O_3$ uses two close outgroups, $(O_2, O_3)$, forming a clade. This is a standard technique to improve rooting robustness. The ancestral character states at the node subtending the outgroup clade can be inferred with greater confidence than from a single outgroup tip. This robustly \"anchors\" the root. By polarizing the character changes at the base of the ingroup more accurately, it reduces the chance that homoplastic states on the long $C$ branch are misinterpreted. The statement that this strategy \"breaks the outgroup-side path\" and \"further reduces LBA risk relative to a single close outgroup\" is a correct description of the advantages of using multiple, closely related outgroups. It is a superior strategy to $O_2$.\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\nD. Midpoint rooting of the unrooted ingroup tree (no outgroup) eliminates LBA because placing the root at the center of the longest path automatically corrects for among-lineage rate variation.\n\nMidpoint rooting is a method that places the root on an unrooted tree at the midpoint of the longest path between any two taxa. This method critically assumes a molecular clock (i.e., equal rates of evolution across all lineages). The problem setup flagrantly violates this assumption: the branch leading to $C$ is far longer ($t_C=1.80$) than the branches leading to $A$ and $B$ (total path from root to A is $t_I+t_A = 0.15$). The longest path in the ingroup tree $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is between $C$ and $A$ (or $B$), with length $t_C+t_I+t_A = 1.80+0.05+0.10 = 1.95$. Midpoint rooting would place the root on the branch to $C$ at a distance of $1.95/2=0.975$ from $C$. This results in the incorrect rooted topology $(C,(A,B))$, whereas the true topology is $((A,B),C)$. The claim that this method \"automatically corrects for among-lineage rate variation\" is false; it is, in fact, highly sensitive and misled by such variation. While it avoids LBA with an outgroup (by not using one), it introduces its own severe errors.\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E Evaluation**\nE. Even with JC69 data and $n \\to \\infty$, MP can be statistically inconsistent with strategy $O_1$ on this branch-length configuration, misplacing the root by grouping $C$ with the outgroup rather than recovering $(A,B)$ as the ingroup clade.\n\nThis statement correctly summarizes the outcome of applying MP under strategy $O_1$. As analyzed for option A, the configuration of two long, non-sister branches ($C$ and $O_1$) separated by a short internal branch ($t_I$) is the classic Felsenstein zone where MP is provably inconsistent. As $n \\to \\infty$, MP will not converge to the true topology $((A,B),(C,O_1))$, but will instead converge to an incorrect topology that erroneously groups the long branches, for example $((C,O_1),(A,B))$. Rooting this incorrect unrooted tree on the designated outgroup $O_1$ leads to a misplaced root and an incorrect set of inferred relationships where the ingroup is not monophyletic. The statement is a precise and accurate description of the LBA artifact in this scenario.\nThe statement is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2729142"}]}
