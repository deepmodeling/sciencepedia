The model of viability selection with HWE is a standard, canonical problem. The language is objective and precise. All necessary parameters and conditions ($p, q, s, h$, fitnesses, HWE) are provided, rendering the problem self-contained and well-posed. There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nUnder Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ before selection are $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively. The provided relative fitnesses are $w_{AA} = 1+s$, $w_{Aa} = 1+hs$, and $w_{aa} = 1$.\n\nAfter selection, the frequency of each genotype is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness.\nFrequency of $AA$ (proportional): $p^2 w_{AA} = p^2 (1+s)$.\nFrequency of $Aa$ (proportional): $2pq w_{Aa} = 2pq (1+hs)$.\nFrequency of $aa$ (proportional): $q^2 w_{aa} = q^2 (1) = q^2$.\n\nTo obtain the true frequencies after selection, we must normalize by the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$. The mean fitness is the sum of the products of the pre-selection genotype frequencies and their respective fitnesses:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa} $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2(1+s) + 2pq(1+hs) + q^2 $$\nExpanding this expression:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 + p^2s + 2pq + 2pqhs + q^2 = (p^2 + 2pq + q^2) + p^2s + 2pqhs $$\nSince $p+q=1$, we have $(p+q)^2 = p^2+2pq+q^2 = 1$. Thus, the mean fitness is:\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 + p^2s + 2pqhs = 1 + s(p^2 + 2pqh) $$\n\nThe frequency of the allele $A$ after selection, denoted $p'$, is the frequency of the $AA$ genotype plus half the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype, after normalization by $\\bar{w}$.\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}(2pq w_{Aa})}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p^2(1+s) + pq(1+hs)}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring out $p$:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p[p(1+s) + q(1+hs)]}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThis is the expression for the allele frequency after selection.\n\nNext, we derive the change in allele frequency, $\\Delta p = p' - p$.\nIt is most efficient to use the concept of marginal fitness. The marginal fitness of allele $A$, $\\bar{w}_A$, is the average fitness of an individual carrying allele $A$.\n$$ \\bar{w}_A = p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa} = p(1+s) + q(1+hs) = p+ps+q+qhs = 1+ps+qhs $$\nSimilarly, the marginal fitness of allele $a$, $\\bar{w}_a$, is:\n$$ \\bar{w}_a = p w_{Aa} + q w_{aa} = p(1+hs) + q(1) = p+phs+q = 1+phs $$\nThe post-selection allele frequency $p'$ can be written as:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p \\bar{w}_A}{\\bar{w}} $$\nNow, we can write $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = p' - p = \\frac{p \\bar{w}_A}{\\bar{w}} - p = \\frac{p \\bar{w}_A - p \\bar{w}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p(\\bar{w}_A - \\bar{w})}{\\bar{w}} $$\nWe know $\\bar{w} = p \\bar{w}_A + q \\bar{w}_a$. Substituting this into the numerator:\n$$ \\bar{w}_A - \\bar{w} = \\bar{w}_A - (p \\bar{w}_A + q \\bar{w}_a) = (1-p) \\bar{w}_A - q \\bar{w}_a = q \\bar{w}_A - q \\bar{w}_a = q(\\bar{w}_A - \\bar{w}_a) $$\nTherefore, the change in allele frequency is:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{pq(\\bar{w}_A - \\bar{w}_a)}{\\bar{w}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\bar{w}_A$ and $\\bar{w}_a$:\n$$ \\bar{w}_A - \\bar{w}_a = (1+ps+qhs) - (1+phs) = ps + qhs - phs = s(p + qh - ph) = s[p(1-h) + qh] $$\nCombining these results gives the final expression for $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{pq s[p(1-h) + qh]}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{pq s[p(1-h) + qh]}{1 + s(p^2 + 2pqh)} $$\nThis is the required general formula for $\\Delta p$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate $\\Delta p$ for the given parameter values: $s = 0.01$, $h = 0.3$, and $p = 0.2$.\nFirst, calculate $q$:\n$$ q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 $$\nNext, we calculate the terms in the expression for $\\Delta p$.\nThe numerator is $pq s[p(1-h) + qh]$. Let's calculate the term in the brackets first:\n$$ p(1-h) + qh = 0.2(1-0.3) + 0.8(0.3) = 0.2(0.7) + 0.24 = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 $$\nNow, the complete numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (0.2)(0.8)(0.01)(0.38) = (0.16)(0.01)(0.38) = 0.0016 \\times 0.38 = 0.000608 $$\nThe denominator is $\\bar{w} = 1 + s(p^2 + 2pqh)$. Let's calculate the term in the parentheses:\n$$ p^2 + 2pqh = (0.2)^2 + 2(0.2)(0.8)(0.3) = 0.04 + 2(0.16)(0.3) = 0.04 + 0.32(0.3) = 0.04 + 0.096 = 0.136 $$\nNow, the complete denominator:\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 + 0.01(0.136) = 1 + 0.00136 = 1.00136 $$\nFinally, we compute $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{0.000608}{1.00136} \\approx 0.0006072040025... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to six significant figures.

The mean fitness of the population, $\\overline{w}$, is the weighted average of the genotype fitnesses:\n$$\n\\overline{w} = p_t^2 w_{AA} + 2p_t q_t w_{Aa} + q_t^2 w_{aa}\n$$\nSubstituting $p_t=1-q_t$ and the given fitness values:\n$$\n\\overline{w} = (1-q_t)^2(1) + 2(1-q_t)q_t(1-hs) + q_t^2(1-s)\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{w} = (1 - 2q_t + q_t^2) + (2q_t - 2q_t^2)(1-hs) + q_t^2 - sq_t^2\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{w} = 1 - 2q_t + q_t^2 + 2q_t - 2hsq_t - 2q_t^2 + 2hsq_t^2 + q_t^2 - sq_t^2\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{w} = 1 - 2hsq_t - sq_t^2 + 2hsq_t^2 = 1 - 2hsq_t - s(1-2h)q_t^2\n$$\nThe frequency of allele $a$ after selection, let's call it $q_t'$, is:\n$$\nq_t' = \\frac{p_t q_t w_{Aa} + q_t^2 w_{aa}}{\\overline{w}} = \\frac{(1-q_t)q_t(1-hs) + q_t^2(1-s)}{\\overline{w}}\n$$\n$$\nq_t' = \\frac{q_t - hsq_t - q_t^2 + hsq_t^2 + q_t^2 - sq_t^2}{\\overline{w}} = \\frac{q_t(1 - hs) - sq_t^2(1-h)}{\\overline{w}}\n$$\nAfter selection, mutation occurs. The frequency of allele $A$ is $p_t' = 1-q_t'$. A fraction $\\mu$ of these $A$ alleles mutates to $a$. The frequency of allele $a$ in the next generation, $q_{t+1}$, is:\n$$\nq_{t+1} = q_t' + \\mu p_t' = q_t' + \\mu(1-q_t') = q_t'(1-\\mu) + \\mu\n$$\nAt equilibrium, $q_{t+1}=q_t=q^{\\ast}$. The change in allele frequency per generation, $\\Delta q = q_{t+1} - q_t$, is zero. A common and effective approximation for weak forces (small $s$, $\\mu$) is to sum their effects: $\\Delta q = \\Delta_s q + \\Delta_\\mu q \\approx 0$.\nThe change due to selection is $\\Delta_s q = q' - q$. For a small $q$, $\\overline{w} \\approx 1$, so:\n$$\n\\Delta_s q \\approx q(1-hs) - sq^2(1-h) - q = -hsq - sq^2(1-h)\n$$\nThe change due to mutation is $\\Delta_\\mu q = \\mu(1-q)$.\nAt equilibrium, $\\Delta_s q^{\\ast} + \\Delta_\\mu q^{\\ast} \\approx 0$:\n$$\n-hsq^{\\ast} - s(q^{\\ast})^2(1-h) + \\mu(1-q^{\\ast}) \\approx 0\n$$\nUnder the given regime $\\mu \\ll s$ and $q^{\\ast} \\ll 1$, we can simplify further. The term $1-q^{\\ast} \\approx 1$. For the selection term, we must compare the magnitudes of $hsq^{\\ast}$ and $s(q^{\\ast})^2$. Since $h=0.2$ is not close to zero and $q^{\\ast} \\ll 1$, the linear term in $q^{\\ast}$ dominates the quadratic term. We can therefore neglect the $s(q^{\\ast})^2(1-h)$ term. This gives the leading-order balance:\n$$\n-hsq^{\\ast} + \\mu \\approx 0\n$$\nSolving for $q^{\\ast}$ yields the leading-order asymptotic expression:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{\\mu}{hs}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this numerically with $\\mu=10^{-6}$, $s=0.01$, and $h=0.2$:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{10^{-6}}{(0.2)(0.01)} = \\frac{10^{-6}}{0.002} = \\frac{10^{-6}}{2 \\times 10^{-3}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.0005\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.0005000$.\n\nNext, we calculate the genetic load, $L$. The problem defines $L = 1 - \\overline{w}$ and requires retaining terms up to order $(q^{\\ast})^2$ in $\\overline{w}$. Our previously derived expression for $\\overline{w}$ is exact to this order:\n$$\n\\overline{w}(q) = 1 - 2hsq - s(1-2h)q^2\n$$\nThe load at equilibrium, $L^{\\ast}$, is therefore:\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 1 - \\overline{w}(q^{\\ast}) = 1 - (1 - 2hsq^{\\ast} - s(1-2h)(q^{\\ast})^2)\n$$\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 2hsq^{\\ast} + s(1-2h)(q^{\\ast})^2\n$$\nTo evaluate $L^{\\ast}$ numerically, we use the values $s=0.01$, $h=0.2$, and our calculated equilibrium frequency $q^{\\ast} = 0.0005$:\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 2(0.2)(0.01)(0.0005) + (0.01)(1 - 2(0.2))(0.0005)^2\n$$\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 2(0.002)(0.0005) + (0.01)(1 - 0.4)(2.5 \\times 10^{-7})\n$$\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 2(2 \\times 10^{-3})(5 \\times 10^{-4}) + (10^{-2})(0.6)(2.5 \\times 10^{-7})\n$$\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 2 \\times 10^{-6} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-9} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} + 0.0015 \\times 10^{-6} = 2.0015 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $2.002 \\times 10^{-6}$, or $0.000002002$.\nThe leading term of the load is $2hsq^{\\ast} \\approx 2hs(\\mu/hs) = 2\\mu = 2 \\times 10^{-6}$.
