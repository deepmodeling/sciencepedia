The allele frequency in this pool is $\\bar{p}$. The allele frequency in deme $i$ after migration, denoted $p'_{i,t}$, is a weighted average of the frequency before migration, $p_{i,t}$, and the frequency of the migrant pool, $\\bar{p}$:\n    $$p'_{i,t} = (1-m)p_{i,t} + m\\bar{p}$$\n\n2.  **Genetic Drift**: The next generation is formed by sampling $2N$ gene copies from the post-migration gene pool of the deme. This is a binomial sampling process (Wright-Fisher model). The expected allele frequency in generation $t+1$ is $E[p_{i,t+1}|p'_{i,t}] = p'_{i,t}$, and the variance due to sampling is $\\operatorname{Var}(p_{i,t+1}|p'_{i,t}) = \\frac{p'_{i,t}(1-p'_{i,t})}{2N}$.\n\nOur goal is to find the equilibrium variance of allele frequencies among demes, $V_{eq} = \\operatorname{Var}(p_i)$.

At equilibrium, a balance is reached between migration, which reduces variance, and drift, which increases it.

This implies that the migration rate $m$ is small ($m \\ll 1$), and generally that the deme size $N$ is large ($1/N \\ll 1$). We can thus approximate the term in the brackets. First, $(1-m)^2 \\approx 1-2m$.\n$$1 - (1-m)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right) \\approx 1 - (1-2m)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)$$\n$$= 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N} - 2m + \\frac{m}{N}\\right) = 2m + \\frac{1}{2N} - \\frac{m}{N}$$\nAs both $m$ and $1/N$ are small, the product term $m/N$ is of a smaller order and can be neglected.

The concepts of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the Wahlund effect, and $F_{ST}$ are cornerstone principles of population genetics. The scenario described—HWE within subpopulations but a heterozygote deficit when pooled, coupled with a small but non-zero $F_{ST}$—is a classic textbook example of population structure. The data ($F_{ST}=0.03$, $L=20$ SNPs) are realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information and clear assumptions (neutrality, unlinked loci, random sampling) to arrive at a logical conclusion. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any criteria for validity; it is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. A formal solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe question requires a determination of whether two aggregations constitute separate populations, based on provided genetic data and fundamental principles.\n\n(i) The definition of a biological population is a group of individuals that are potentially interbreeding and where mating is random (panmixia) at the spatiotemporal scale under consideration. An ideal population is a panmictic unit.\n\n(ii) Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) describes a state where allele and genotype frequencies remain constant across generations in an infinitely large, randomly mating population free from mutation, migration, and selection. Observation of HWE within each aggregation, as stated in the problem, implies that the condition of random mating is met *within* each aggregation at the observed spatiotemporal scale.\n\n(iii) The Wahlund effect is the reduction in observed heterozygosity (and a corresponding excess of homozygotes) in a sample that is a mixture of two or more distinct subpopulations, compared to HWE expectations based on the pooled allele frequencies. The problem states that when the two aggregations are pooled, a \"statistically significant heterozygote deficit consistent with a Wahlund effect\" is observed. This is direct, powerful evidence that the two aggregations are *not* a single, randomly-mating unit. The existence of the Wahlund effect signifies a departure from panmixia across the combined group, meaning they fail to meet the definition of a single population. Therefore, for any analysis that assumes panmixia, they must be treated as separate operational units.\n\n(iv) The fixation index, $F_{ST}$, quantifies the genetic differentiation among subpopulations. It is defined as the standardized variance in allele frequencies among the subpopulations, or equivalently, as the correlation of uniting gametes relative to gametes drawn at random from the total population. A value of $F_{ST}=0$ implies no differentiation (panmixia), while $F_{ST}=1$ implies complete fixation of different alleles in different subpopulations. The given value is $F_{ST}=0.03$. This value, being greater than $0$, confirms the conclusion from the Wahlund effect: there is demonstrable genetic differentiation between the two aggregations.\n\nTo interpret the magnitude of $F_{ST}=0.03$, we use the provided island-model approximation. In a simple island model at equilibrium between drift and migration, $F_{ST}$ is related to the number of effective migrants per generation ($Nm$) by the formula:\n$$F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 4Nm}$$\nwhere $N$ is the effective population size of a deme and $m$ is the migration rate. Solving for $Nm$:\n$$4Nm \\approx \\frac{1}{F_{ST}} - 1$$\nSubstituting the given value $F_{ST}=0.03$:\n$$4Nm \\approx \\frac{1}{0.03} - 1 = 33.33... - 1 = 32.33...$$\n$$Nm \\approx \\frac{32.33...}{4} \\approx 8.08$$\nAn estimated number of approximately $8$ effective migrants per generation is substantial. A common, though informal, guideline in conservation and evolutionary biology is that $Nm > 1$ is sufficient to prevent strong differentiation due to genetic drift. A value of $Nm \\approx 8$ indicates a significant level of gene flow connecting the two aggregations. This means that while they are not a single panmictic unit, they are also not evolutionarily independent. They are demographically connected components of a larger metapopulation.\n\n**Conclusion Synthesis**\nThe evidence points to a two-part conclusion:\n1.  The aggregations are distinct mating units, not a single panmictic population. This is proven by the significant Wahlund effect. Thus, for modeling purposes requiring an assumption of random mating, they must be treated as separate \"operational populations\".\n2.  The aggregations are not evolutionarily independent. The low but non-zero $F_{ST}$ value translates to substantial gene flow, indicating they are connected demes within a broader metapopulation structure.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **They should be treated as separate operational populations for analyses that assume random mating, because the significant Wahlund effect when pooled shows that random mating does not occur across the combined set at the sampling scale, while within-aggregation HWE is consistent with random mating. However, $F_{ST}=0.03$ implies substantial gene flow, so they are connected demes within a larger metapopulation rather than evolutionarily independent units.**\nThis statement is perfectly aligned with the derivation. It correctly identifies that the Wahlund effect requires treating them as separate operational units for certain analyses. It also correctly interprets the $F_{ST}=0.03$ value as indicating substantial gene flow, leading to the accurate conclusion that they are connected demes, not independent units. This captures the necessary nuance of the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. **They should be treated as a single panmictic population, because $F_{ST}=0.03$ is below the conventional $0.05$ threshold for “low differentiation,” and the Wahlund effect is likely a statistical artifact that can be ignored when sample sizes are large.**\nThis option is flawed. The problem explicitly states the Wahlund effect is \"statistically significant,\" contradicting the claim that it is an artifact to be ignored. The presence of a significant Wahlund effect is definitive proof against panmixia. Furthermore, while $F_{ST}=0.03$ may be qualitatively described as \"low,\" it is significantly different from zero, and its interpretation must be consistent with the other data. Relying on an arbitrary threshold like $0.05$ to declare panmixia is poor scientific reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. **They are distinct, effectively isolated populations (approaching species-level isolation), because any nonzero $F_{ST}$, even as small as $0.03$, demonstrates negligible gene flow and near-complete reproductive isolation.**\nThis is a severe misinterpretation of the data. As calculated, $F_{ST}=0.03$ corresponds to approximately $8$ effective migrants per generation. This is considered substantial gene flow, not \"negligible.\" It is entirely inconsistent with \"near-complete reproductive isolation.\" This option represents an extreme and incorrect conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. **No inference about population status is possible from these genetic data; without explicit demographic measurements of dispersal and mating, neither HWE, the Wahlund effect, nor $F_{ST}$ can inform whether the aggregations are separate populations.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The entire field of population genetics is dedicated to making inferences about population structure, mating systems, and demographic history from genetic data. The combination of HWE tests, Wahlund effect analysis, and $F_{ST}$ estimation is a standard and powerful framework for precisely this purpose. To claim these data are uninformative is to reject foundational principles of the discipline.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2700030"}]}
