We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the Hardy–Weinberg principle for a diploid species at a biallelic locus. Let the alleles be $A$ and $a$, with frequencies $p$ and $q$ respectively, such that $p+q=1$. In a population under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)—that is, assuming random mating, no selection, no mutation, and no gene flow—the expected frequencies of the genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ are $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively. The expected heterozygosity, denoted $H$, is the expected frequency of the heterozygous genotype $Aa$, which is given by the expression $H = 2pq$.\n\nThe problem specifies a population subdivided into $2$ demes of equal census size. We are given the frequencies of allele $A$ in each deme.\nIn deme $1$, the frequency of allele $A$ is $p_1 = 0.2$. Consequently, the frequency of allele $a$ is $q_1 = 1 - p_1 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\nIn deme $2$, the frequency of allele $A$ is $p_2 = 0.8$. Consequently, the frequency of allele $a$ is $q_2 = 1 - p_2 = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average within-deme heterozygosity, $H_S$. Each deme is stated to be in HWE. Therefore, we can calculate the expected heterozygosity for each deme individually.\nFor deme $1$, the expected heterozygosity is $H_1 = 2p_1q_1$.\nFor deme $2$, the expected heterozygosity is $H_2 = 2p_2q_2$.\n\n$H_S$ is defined as the average of these heterozygosities, weighted by deme size. Since the demes are of equal size, the weights are equal ($1/2$ for each deme):\n$$H_S = \\frac{1}{2}H_1 + \\frac{1}{2}H_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(2p_1q_1) + \\frac{1}{2}(2p_2q_2) = p_1q_1 + p_2q_2$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$H_S = (0.2)(0.8) + (0.8)(0.2) = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total expected heterozygosity, $H_T$. This is the expected heterozygosity that would exist if the two demes were pooled into a single, panmictic population. To compute this, we must first determine the pooled allele frequencies for the total population. Let $\\bar{p}$ and $\\bar{q}$ be the frequencies of alleles $A$ and $a$ in the total population, respectively. Since the demes are of equal size, the pooled frequencies are the arithmetic means of the individual deme frequencies:\n$$\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_1 + p_2}{2}$$\n$$\\bar{q} = \\frac{q_1 + q_2}{2} = 1 - \\bar{p}$$\nSubstituting the given values for $p_1$ and $p_2$:\n$$\\bar{p} = \\frac{0.2 + 0.8}{2} = \\frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5$$\nThus, the pooled frequency for allele $a$ is $\\bar{q} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nNow, we calculate $H_T$ using the pooled allele frequencies, assuming the total population behaves as a single unit in HWE:\n$$H_T = 2\\bar{p}\\bar{q}$$\nSubstituting the calculated pooled frequencies:\n$$H_T = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.5$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the heterozygote deficit due to the Wahlund effect, which is the difference $H_T - H_S$. This quantity measures the reduction in heterozygosity caused by population subdivision, compared to the expectation under panmixia.\n$$H_T - H_S = 0.5 - 0.32 = 0.18$$\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed as an exact fraction.\n$$0.18 = \\frac{18}{100} = \\frac{9}{50}$$\nThis deficit, $H_T - H_S$, is a direct consequence of the variance in allele frequencies among subpopulations, $\\text{Var}(p)$. For $k_d$ demes of equal size, the general relationship is $H_S = H_T - 2\\text{Var}(p)$, or $H_T-H_S = 2\\text{Var}(p)$. In this specific case with $2$ demes, $\\text{Var}(p) = \\frac{(p_1 - \\bar{p})^2 + (p_2 - \\bar{p})^2}{2} = \\frac{(0.2 - 0.5)^2 + (0.8 - 0.5)^2}{2} = \\frac{(-0.3)^2 + (0.3)^2}{2} = \\frac{0.09 + 0.09}{2} = 0.09$.

The problem is a standard, formalizable exercise in applying the principles of HWE to a structured population. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\nLet $p_i$ be the frequency of allele $A$ in deme $i$, and $q_i = 1 - p_i$ be the frequency of allele $a$. The problem gives $3$ demes with allele frequencies $p_1 = 0.1$, $p_2 = 0.5$, and $p_3 = 0.9$. Consequently, the allele $a$ frequencies are $q_1 = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$, $q_2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$, and $q_3 = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\n\nWithin each deme $i$, mating is random, so the genotype frequencies are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The expected frequencies for genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ are given by $p_i^2$, $2p_iq_i$, and $q_i^2$, respectively.\nFor deme $1$:\n$f_{AA,1} = p_1^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01$\n$f_{Aa,1} = 2p_1q_1 = 2(0.1)(0.9) = 0.18$\n$f_{aa,1} = q_1^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81$\n\nFor deme $2$:\n$f_{AA,2} = p_2^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n$f_{Aa,2} = 2p_2q_2 = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.50$\n$f_{aa,2} = q_2^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n\nFor deme $3$:\n$f_{AA,3} = p_3^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81$\n$f_{Aa,3} = 2p_3q_3 = 2(0.9)(0.1) = 0.18$\n$f_{aa,3} = q_3^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01$\n\nThe pooled sample is formed by combining equal-sized random samples from each of the $k=3$ demes. Thus, the weight of each deme in the pooled sample is $w_i = \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{3}$. The overall genotype frequencies in the pooled sample ($f_{AA}$, $f_{Aa}$, $f_{aa}$) are the weighted averages of the frequencies in the individual demes.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires deriving these frequencies in terms of $\\{p_i\\}$ and the weights. Symbolically, for $k$ demes with weights $w_i$, the pooled frequencies are:\n$f_{AA} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i f_{AA,i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i p_i^2$\n$f_{Aa} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i f_{Aa,i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (2p_i q_i)$\n$f_{aa} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i f_{aa,i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i q_i^2$\nFor this specific problem with $w_i = 1/3$:\n$f_{AA} = \\frac{1}{3}(p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2) = \\frac{1}{3}(0.01 + 0.25 + 0.81) = \\frac{1.07}{3}$\n$f_{Aa} = \\frac{1}{3}(2p_1q_1 + 2p_2q_2 + 2p_3q_3) = \\frac{1}{3}(0.18 + 0.50 + 0.18) = \\frac{0.86}{3}$\n$f_{aa} = \\frac{1}{3}(q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2) = \\frac{1}{3}(0.81 + 0.25 + 0.01) = \\frac{1.07}{3}$\n\nThe second part of the problem requires calculating the coefficient $F_W$. This requires two quantities: $H_{\\mathrm{pooled}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{HWE}}$.\n\n$H_{\\mathrm{pooled}}$ is the expected heterozygosity in the pooled sample, which is simply the calculated frequency of heterozygotes, $f_{Aa}$.\n$H_{\\mathrm{pooled}} = f_{Aa} = \\frac{0.86}{3}$.\nTo obtain an exact fraction, we work with fractions from the start.\n$p_1 = \\frac{1}{10}$, $p_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $p_3 = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n$q_1 = \\frac{9}{10}$, $q_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $q_3 = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n$H_{\\mathrm{pooled}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ 2\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) \\right]$\n$H_{\\mathrm{pooled}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\left[ \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{9}{100} \\right] = \\frac{2}{3} \\left[ \\frac{18}{100} + \\frac{25}{100} \\right] = \\frac{2}{3} \\left( \\frac{43}{100} \\right) = \\frac{43}{150}$.\n\n$H_{\\mathrm{HWE}}$ is the expected heterozygosity if the pooled population were panmictic.
