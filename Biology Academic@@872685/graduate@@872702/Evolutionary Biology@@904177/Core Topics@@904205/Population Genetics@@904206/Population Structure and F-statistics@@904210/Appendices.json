For a quantity to be a metric distance $d$, it must satisfy $d(x,z) \\leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$ for any three points $x, y, z$. Here, we must check if $F_{ST}(A,C) \\leq F_{ST}(A,B) + F_{ST}(B,C)$.\nSubstituting our computed values:\n$$\n1 \\leq \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n$$\n1 \\leq \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThis inequality is false. Therefore, $F_{ST}$ violates the triangle inequality and is not a metric distance.\n\nThis violation has significant implications for distance-based clustering methods such as UPGMA or neighbor-joining. Such algorithms implicitly or explicitly assume that the input pairwise distances form a metric space. When a non-metric measure like $F_{ST}$ is used, the geometric interpretation of distances breaks down. The \"direct\" distance between two populations ($A$ and $C$) can appear longer than an \"indirect\" path via an intermediate population ($B$). This can lead to distorted or logically inconsistent phylogenetic tree topologies, where branch lengths do not accurately reflect evolutionary divergence. For this reason, transformations of $F_{ST}$, such as $-\\ln(1 - F_{ST})$ or $F_{ST} / (1 - F_{ST})$, are often employed as they exhibit more desirable metric properties.\n\nFinally, we compute the requested quantity $D$:\n$$\nD \\equiv F_{ST}(A,C) - \\big(F_{ST}(A,B) + F_{ST}(B,C)\\big)\n$$\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\n$$\nD = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nAs a decimal rounded to four significant figures, $D = 0.33333... \\approx 0.3333$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3333}\n$$", "id": "2745306"}]}
