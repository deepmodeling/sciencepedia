The problem is scientifically grounded, describing a classic scenario in quantitative evolutionary genetics consistent with well-documented field studies (e.g., *Geospiza fortis* on the Galápagos islands). It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear theoretical framework (the infinitesimal model) to compute a unique answer. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity; it is a standard, formalizable problem in evolutionary biology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected one-generation change in the population mean beak depth. This quantity is known as the response to selection, denoted by $R$. The fundamental equation of quantitative genetics that connects the response to selection, heritability, and the selection differential is the breeder's equation:\n$$R = h^2 S$$\nwhere $h^2$ is the narrow-sense heritability of the trait and $S$ is the selection differential. Each component must be determined from the provided data.\n\nFirst, we calculate the selection differential, $S$. The selection differential is defined as the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents and the mean phenotype of the entire population before selection.\nThe mean of the pre-selection cohort is given as $\\mu_{\\text{pre}} = 9.75$ mm.\nThe mean of the individuals that survived the drought and became the breeding population is $\\mu_{\\text{breed}} = 10.12$ mm.\nThus, the selection differential $S$ is:\n$$S = \\mu_{\\text{breed}} - \\mu_{\\text{pre}}$$\n$$S = 10.12 \\, \\text{mm} - 9.75 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.37 \\, \\text{mm}$$\n\nNext, we determine the narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$. Narrow-sense heritability is defined as the ratio of additive genetic variance ($V_A$) to the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$):\n$$h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}$$\nThe problem provides the slope of the regression of offspring phenotype on a single parent's phenotype, $b_{\\text{OP}} = 0.27$. For a trait determined by additive gene action, and under the stated conditions of random mating and no common environmental effects between parent and offspring (ensured by cross-fostering), the theoretical covariance between a single parent and its offspring is $\\text{Cov}(\\text{P, O}) = \\frac{1}{2} V_A$.\nThe slope of the linear regression of offspring on a single parent is defined as:\n$$b_{\\text{OP}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(\\text{P, O})}{V_P}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the covariance:\n$$b_{\\text{OP}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} V_A}{V_P} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_A}{V_P} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} h^2$$\nTherefore, the narrow-sense heritability can be estimated as twice the slope of the single parent-offspring regression:\n$$h^2 = 2 \\times b_{\\text{OP}}$$\nUsing the given value $b_{\\text{OP}} = 0.27$:\n$$h^2 = 2 \\times 0.27 = 0.54$$\nHeritability is a dimensionless quantity. The standard error of the slope, $\\text{SE} = 0.03$, is provided to indicate the precision of the estimate but is not required for the calculation of the point estimate of $h^2$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the expected response to selection, $R$, using the breeder's equation with the calculated values of $h^2$ and $S$:\n$$R = h^2 S$$\n$$R = (0.54) \\times (0.37 \\, \\text{mm})$$\n$$R = 0.1998 \\, \\text{mm}$$\n\nThis value, $R = 0.1998$ mm, represents the expected change in the mean beak depth for the next generation's cohort of juveniles before they undergo selection, relative to the mean of the parental generation's cohort before selection.

Common-garden experiments are a classic and powerful tool for this purpose, allowing researchers to disentangle the effects of genetics from those of the environment. This problem challenges you to interpret the results of such an experiment, using the famous threespine stickleback system to determine whether observed armor reduction is an evolved trait or a plastic response. [@problem_id:2705805]", "problem": "A freshwater colonization event by threespine sticklebacks has produced populations with reduced lateral armor plates relative to their ancestral marine source. You are tasked with separating phenotypic plasticity from genetic change using a common-garden approach. As foundational premises, use the following well-tested and widely accepted bases: (i) phenotypes can be decomposed as $z = G + E + G \\times E + \\epsilon$, where $G$ is the additive genetic contribution to the trait, $E$ is the environmental contribution, $G \\times E$ is the genotype-by-environment interaction that manifests as reaction norm differences, and $\\epsilon$ is residual error; (ii) a common-garden design equalizes $E$ to reveal $G$ when comparing genotypes; (iii) maternal effects and transgenerational plasticity can persist into the first laboratory generation and are typically reduced by evaluating the second laboratory generation; (iv) a significant genotype-by-environment interaction implies that reaction norm slopes differ among genotypes, whereas a significant genotype main effect persisting across environments and generations indicates heritable divergence in mean trait value.\n\nYou collect wild $P$ generation breeders from one marine population $M$ and two independently colonized freshwater lakes $L_1$ and $L_2$ (colonized within approximately $50$ years). Within each population, controlled within-population crosses yield $F_1$ families. Each $F_1$ family is split and reared under two standardized salinity environments: a saltwater condition $S$ (marine salinity) and a freshwater condition $F$ (lake-like ionic strength). All other conditions are standardized. Adult $F_1$ are then crossed within population to generate $F_2$ families, which are again split and reared in $S$ and $F$. Lateral armor plates are counted at maturity by a blind observer. Sample sizes per population per environment per generation are approximately $n \\approx 60$ adults, drawn from at least $10$ full-sib families per group.\n\nIn the $F_2$ generation, a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with fixed factors “population of origin” (three levels: $M$, $L_1$, $L_2$) and “rearing environment” (two levels: $S$, $F$), and family as a random effect, yields the following summary for mean plate counts (mean $\\pm$ standard error) and tests of fixed effects:\n\n- Mean plate counts: $M$ in $S$: $22.1 \\pm 0.4$; $M$ in $F$: $20.3 \\pm 0.5$. $L_1$ in $S$: $12.4 \\pm 0.5$; $L_1$ in $F$: $10.7 \\pm 0.5$. $L_2$ in $S$: $13.0 \\pm 0.4$; $L_2$ in $F$: $11.4 \\pm 0.5$.\n- Population main effect: $F_{2,\\,\\text{df}} = 162.3$, $P < 0.001$.\n- Environment main effect: $F_{1,\\,\\text{df}} = 19.8$, $P < 0.001$.\n- Genotype-by-environment interaction: $F_{2,\\,\\text{df}} = 1.2$, $P = 0.30$.\n\nA parallel analysis in $F_1$ shows the same qualitative pattern but with slightly larger between-population differences, consistent with possible maternal or carryover effects. In a subset of families genotyped at the Ectodysplasin (EDA) locus, a major-effect gene known to influence plate number, the frequency of the low-plating allele is $p_M = 0.08$ in $M$ breeders and $p_{L_1} = 0.82$, $p_{L_2} = 0.79$ in $L_1$ and $L_2$ breeders; in $F_2$ progeny from $M$ reared in $F$, $p \\approx 0.08$, whereas in $F_2$ progeny from $L_1$ and $L_2$ reared in $S$ or $F$, $p \\approx 0.80$.\n\nWhich option best captures the logically warranted inference about plasticity versus genetic change, based strictly on these results and the stated bases?\n\nA. The reduced armor in lake fish is primarily due to genetic change, because a large population main effect on plate number persists across $S$ and $F$ in the $F_2$, with no detectable genotype-by-environment interaction; the modest environment effect indicates some plasticity shared across genotypes but cannot account for the between-population divergence.\n\nB. The reduced armor is entirely an environmentally induced plastic response, because the environment main effect is significant; therefore, rearing in freshwater suffices to explain the observed lake phenotypes without invoking genetic evolution.\n\nC. Because the genotype-by-environment interaction is not significant, genetic differentiation cannot be inferred; the reaction norms are parallel, so the observed divergence must be plastic.\n\nD. The $F_2$ common-garden evidence is insufficient; only a reciprocal transplant of wild-caught adults between $M$ and the lakes, without laboratory generations, can separate plasticity from genetic change in this system.", "solution": "We begin from the decomposition $z = G + E + G \\times E + \\epsilon$, where $z$ is the phenotypic plate count, $G$ the additive genetic effect (captured as a population main effect in a design where genotypes are nested within populations and families), $E$ the environmental effect (here salinity rearing environment), and $G \\times E$ the interaction that manifests as differing reaction norm slopes among genotypes. A properly executed common-garden design equalizes $E$ within each environment and allows inferences about $G$ and $G \\times E$ by comparing reaction norms across genotypes or populations. Further, $F_2$ evaluation reduces maternal effects and transgenerational carryover that may affect $F_1$.\n\nIn the $F_2$, the means show that marine-origin genotypes $M$ have high plate counts in both environments, $22.1$ in $S$ and $20.3$ in $F$, while lake-origin genotypes $L_1$ and $L_2$ have much lower plate counts in both environments, roughly $12.4$ to $13.0$ in $S$ and $10.7$ to $11.4$ in $F$. The environment effect reduces plates by approximately $1.7$ to $2.0$ within each population when moving from $S$ to $F$, but the between-population differences are much larger: comparing $M$ versus $L_1$, the gap in $S$ is approximately $22.1 - 12.4 = 9.7$, and in $F$ is approximately $20.3 - 10.7 = 9.6$. These nearly equal differences across environments imply parallel reaction norms (no strong $G \\times E$), consistent with the non-significant genotype-by-environment interaction ($P = 0.30$). The highly significant population main effect ($P < 0.001$) indicates that, after controlling for the environment, populations differ in mean phenotype; given that all rearing conditions other than salinity are standardized, and the effect persists into $F_2$, the most parsimonious interpretation is that these population differences are heritable (genetic) rather than solely plastic or maternal.\n\nThe significant environment main effect ($P < 0.001$) indicates there is some plasticity shared across genotypes: moving to freshwater reduces plate counts modestly for all populations. However, because the marine genotype reared in freshwater remains far from the lake genotypes reared in freshwater (approximately $20.3$ versus approximately $10.7$ to $11.4$), the environment effect alone cannot account for the observed lake phenotypes. The absence of a genotype-by-environment interaction implies that the reaction norms are parallel and that the rank ordering of populations does not change across environments; this strengthens the inference that population mean differences reflect evolved genetic divergence rather than environment-specific expression.\n\nThe allele frequency data at the Ectodysplasin (EDA) locus corroborate this inference: a high frequency of a low-plating allele in the lake populations ($p \\approx 0.8$) and low frequency in the marine population ($p \\approx 0.08$) is observed, and these frequencies persist in $F_2$ across environments. While candidate-gene data are not strictly required to conclude genetic divergence from the common-garden experiment, they are consistent with a genetic basis for the lower plate counts and argue against an explanation based solely on plasticity.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option aligns with the data and principles. The large and highly significant population main effect in $F_2$ across both $S$ and $F$, coupled with non-significant genotype-by-environment interaction, indicates that the lake populations possess heritable changes leading to reduced plate counts, and that these changes express similarly across environments. The significant environment main effect documents modest plasticity common to all populations but does not erase or explain the between-population divergence. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This option overinterprets the environment main effect. A significant environment effect establishes that plasticity exists, but it does not imply that plasticity fully explains the observed lake phenotypes. The marine genotype reared in $F$ remains far more plated than lake genotypes reared in $F$, so plasticity alone cannot account for the divergence; the population main effect in $F_2$ indicates heritable differences. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option misinterprets the role of genotype-by-environment interaction. A non-significant $G \\times E$ does not preclude genetic differentiation; instead, it implies that differences among genotypes are parallel across environments. Genetic differentiation is captured by the population main effect, which is highly significant and large in magnitude in $F_2$. Therefore, the conclusion that divergence “must be plastic” is unwarranted. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option dismisses the key strength of the two-generation common-garden design. Reciprocal transplants of wild-caught adults cannot, on their own, eliminate maternal effects, developmental history, or age-dependent carryover effects. In contrast, the $F_2$ common-garden design specifically addresses these issues and is sufficient to separate plasticity (environment main effect) from genetic change (population main effect persisting across environments), particularly when genotype-by-environment interaction is absent or small. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the logically warranted inference given the data is that lake populations have evolved genetically reduced armor plating, with a modest, shared plastic response to freshwater that does not account for the between-population divergence.

It describes a realistic scenario of rapid adaptation and asks for an appropriate analytical framework to dissect the underlying evolutionary process using temporal genomic data. All parameters and concepts—such as the selection coefficient $s$, effective population size $N_e$, recombination rate $r$, and the statistical methods mentioned—are standard and scientifically grounded. The problem is valid. We will proceed to its solution.\n\nThe objective is to distinguish between three sources of an adaptive allele (de novo mutation, standing genetic variation, or migration) and two modes of selective sweep (hard versus soft), using time-series whole-genome data. A correct analytical design must leverage the unique strengths of temporal data, which are the direct observation of allele frequency change and the corresponding evolution of haplotype structure.\n\nThe fundamental principles are as follows:\n1.  **Allele Trajectory Analysis**: The change in allele frequency, $p_t$, over time is the most direct signature of selection. Candidate loci for selection are those where the observed trajectory $\\{p_t\\}$ is highly improbable under a null model of genetic drift alone, but is well-explained by a Wright-Fisher (WF) model incorporating selection. The strength of selection, $s$, can be estimated from these trajectories.\n2.  **Source of Adaptation**: The source of the adaptive allele is inferred by its state at the initial time point, $t=0$, and its genomic context.\n    *   A **de novo mutation** will be absent (or at an undetectable frequency, consistent with $p_0=0$) in the initial population sample. It appears at a later time point.\n    *   An allele from **standing genetic variation (SGV)** will be present at a detectable frequency, $p_0 > 0$, at the start of the selection episode. If it is an old polymorphism, it may reside on multiple distinct haplotype backgrounds.\n    *   An allele from **migration/introgression** will arrive on a long, contiguous block of chromosome originating from the source population. This block will have a distinct ancestry signature and its physical length will be progressively shortened by recombination across subsequent generations, at a rate proportional to the recombination rate $r$ and time $t$. This can be detected using local ancestry inference (LAI) or by identifying long identity-by-descent (IBD) tracts.\n3.  **Sweep Dynamics (Hard vs. Soft)**: The nature of the sweep is determined by the number of distinct haplotype backgrounds on which the adaptive allele rises in frequency.\n    *   A **hard sweep** originates from a single adaptive haplotype. This leads to a drastic reduction in local genetic diversity ($\\pi$), a single dominant haplotype at high frequency, and a characteristic long-range haplotype structure, measurable with statistics like Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH).\n    *   A **soft sweep** involves the concurrent increase in frequency of multiple haplotypes carrying the adaptive allele. This results in a less severe reduction in local diversity ($\\pi$) and the presence of several high-frequency haplotypes. Haplotype-based statistics such as $H_{12}$ (frequency of the two most common haplotypes) and the ratio $H_2/H_1$ (frequency of the second-most-common to most-common haplotype) are designed to distinguish these cases. A hard sweep yields a high $H_{12}$ but a very low $H_2/H_1$, while a soft sweep yields a high $H_{12}$ and a substantially nonzero $H_2/H_1$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**Option A:** This option proposes a comprehensive and correct workflow.\n1.  It correctly prioritizes the use of haplotype information by \"jointly phase the time series data.\" Phasing is essential for any analysis of sweep dynamics.\n2.  It uses the most direct evidence of selection by \"fitting a WF selection model to allele-frequency trajectories $\\{p_t\\}$\" to find candidate loci and estimate $s$. This is a state-of-the-art use of temporal data.\n3.  It proposes a complete suite of appropriate statistics to characterize the sweep: nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$), Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), EHH/iHS, and the haplotype homozygosity statistics $H_{12}$ and $H_2/H_1$. The emphasis on \"time-resolved\" analysis is key.\n4.  It correctly identifies local ancestry inference as the proper method for detecting migration and accurately describes the expected temporal decay of migrant tracts.\n5.  Finally, it provides a completely accurate description of the expected signatures for each scenario: the absence at $t=0$ for a *de novo* hard sweep; the nonzero $p_0$ and high $H_2/H_1$ for a soft sweep from SGV; and the long, foreign haplotype for migration.\nThis option is a textbook example of a correct experimental design for this problem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:** This option is fundamentally flawed.\n1.  It proposes to \"use only the SFS at $t=20$,\" which discards the most powerful aspect of the dataset: the temporal dynamics across generations $t=0, 5, 10, 20$. This is an unjustifiable waste of information.\n2.  The statement that \"soft and hard sweeps are indistinguishable in haplotype-based statistics\" is factually incorrect. Statistics like $H_{12}$ and $H_2/H_1$ are specifically designed for and powerful at making this distinction.\n3.  Inferring the source of adaptation (de novo, standing, or migration) \"directly from the sign of Tajima’s $D$\" is nonsensical. Tajima's $D$ is a summary of the site frequency spectrum (SFS) and contains no information to distinguish these different historical origins. For that, one must analyze the allele's state at $t=0$ and its haplotype context.\nThis option demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of modern population genetic methods.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:** This option misinterprets and misapplies a valid, but perhaps non-optimal, statistical method.\n1.  The temporal covariance of allele frequencies is a valid signal for detecting selection, particularly polygenic selection. However, for a major-effect locus as specified, direct trajectory analysis (as in Option A) is more direct and powerful.\n2.  The classification rule \"negative covariance implies a soft sweep, positive covariance implies a hard sweep\" is an incorrect oversimplification of the theoretical predictions from this method. The interpretation of such covariance patterns is far more complex.\n3.  The inference that a genome-wide average covariance near zero excludes migration is a non-sequitur. Nearly all population genetic models, with or without migration, predict a genome-wide average covariance of zero. This metric provides no information about whether a single locus was subject to adaptive introgression.\nThis option is based on a flawed understanding of the proposed statistic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:** This option is incorrect on multiple fundamental points.\n1.  It begins by suggesting \"pooled sequencing (no phasing),\" which would require throwing away the individual-level genotype data that the problem states is available. This prevents the very haplotype analyses that are crucial to distinguishing hard from soft sweeps.\n2.  The prediction that \"hard sweeps will reduce LD and increase $\\pi$\" is factually backward. A classic hard sweep *increases* local LD by creating a large block of near-identical haplotypes and drastically *reduces* nucleotide diversity, $\\pi$, by eliminating polymorphism.\n3.  The prediction that \"soft sweeps will show stronger LD increases\" is also false. A hard sweep produces the strongest and most distinct LD pattern.\n4.  Using an arbitrary $F_{ST}$ threshold ($F_{ST} > 0.5$) to classify the source as migration is baseless. High temporal $F_{ST}$ indicates a large frequency change, a hallmark of strong selection, but it does not diagnose the allele's origin.\nThis option makes claims that are in direct opposition to established population genetics theory.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, only Option A outlines a scientifically rigorous, comprehensive, and correct analytical strategy that properly utilizes the provided temporal genomic data to address the stated research question.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2705752"}]}
