The problem is well-posed, requiring both derivation from first principles and a conceptual explanation, which tests fundamental understanding rather than rote application of formulas. It is free of ambiguity, subjective claims, or logical contradictions.\n\nProceeding with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Age Equation\n\nThe starting point is the fundamental law of radioactive decay for the parent nuclide, $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$. Let $N_{238}(t)$ be the number of $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ atoms at time $t$ after crystallization. The rate of decay is proportional to the number of atoms present:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{238}(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda_{238} N_{238}(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Integration from time $t=0$ (crystallization) to a generic time $t$ yields:\n$$\nN_{238}(t) = N_{238,0} \\exp(-\\lambda_{238} t)\n$$\nwhere $N_{238,0}$ is the initial number of $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ atoms at $t=0$.\n\nThe problem states the system is closed. This implies that for every parent atom of $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ that decays, a daughter atom of $^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}$ is produced. The number of parent atoms that have decayed by time $t$ is the difference between the initial amount and the current amount: $N_{238,0} - N_{238}(t)$. This quantity equals the number of radiogenic daughter atoms, denoted $N_{206}^*(t)$.\n$$\nN_{206}^*(t) = N_{238,0} - N_{238}(t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the zircon excluded non-radiogenic lead at crystallization, meaning the initial concentration of $^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}$ was zero. Thus, all $^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}$ present is radiogenic.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{238}(t)$:\n$$\nN_{206}^*(t) = N_{238,0} - N_{238,0} \\exp(-\\lambda_{238} t) = N_{238,0} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{238} t))\n$$\nThe problem provides the present-day ratio of the radiogenic daughter to the remaining parent, which we denote as $\\frac{^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}^{*}}{^{238}\\mathrm{U}}$. This is equivalent to the ratio $\\frac{N_{206}^*(t)}{N_{238}(t)}$.\n$$\n\\frac{^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}^{*}}{^{238}\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{N_{206}^*(t)}{N_{238}(t)} = \\frac{N_{238,0} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{238} t))}{N_{238,0} \\exp(-\\lambda_{238} t)}\n$$\nThe initial number of parent atoms, $N_{238,0}$, cancels.\n$$\n\\frac{^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}^{*}}{^{238}\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{238} t)}{\\exp(-\\lambda_{238} t)} = \\exp(\\lambda_{238} t) - 1\n$$\nThis fundamental relationship connects the measured isotopic ratio to the age of the sample. To find the expression for the age $t$, we must solve for $t$:\n$$\n\\exp(\\lambda_{238} t) = 1 + \\frac{^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}^{*}}{^{238}\\mathrm{U}}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\lambda_{238} t = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}^{*}}{^{238}\\mathrm{U}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, isolating $t$ gives the desired expression for the crystallization age:\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{238}} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}^{*}}{^{238}\\mathrm{U}}\\right)\n$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Crystallization Age\n\nWe now evaluate this expression using the data provided: $\\lambda_{238} = 1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\\frac{^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}^{*}}{^{238}\\mathrm{U}} = 0.25$.\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}} \\ln(1 + 0.25)\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\ln(1.25)}{1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}}\\ \\mathrm{yr}\n$$\nThe numerical evaluation yields:\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{0.22314355}{1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}}\\ \\mathrm{yr} \\approx 1438475877\\ \\mathrm{yr}\n$$\nThis is approximately $1.438475877 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{yr}$. The problem requires the age in million years (Ma, where $1\\ \\mathrm{Ma} = 10^6\\ \\mathrm{yr}$) and rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nt \\approx 1438.475877\\ \\mathrm{Ma}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$\nt \\approx 1438\\ \\mathrm{Ma}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Explanation of Discordance from Lead Loss\n\nWe must explain from first principles why fractional lead loss affects the two uranium-lead chronometers differently. The two systems are:\n1.  $^{238}\\mathrm{U} \\to {}^{206}\\mathrm{Pb}$ with decay constant $\\lambda_{238}$\n2.  $^{235}\\mathrm{U} \\to {}^{207}\\mathrm{Pb}$ with decay constant $\\lambda_{235}$\n\nIt is a fundamental fact that the decay constants are different: $\\lambda_{235} \\approx 9.8485 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which is significantly larger than $\\lambda_{238}$.\n\nFor any closed system of true age $t$, the true isotopic ratios are given by:\n$$\nR_{206/238}^{\\text{true}} = \\exp(\\lambda_{238} t) - 1\n$$\n$$\nR_{207/235}^{\\text{true}} = \\exp(\\lambda_{235} t) - 1\n$$\nNow, consider a geologic event that causes the loss of a fraction $f$ of the total accumulated radiogenic lead for both isotopes. The parent nuclide amounts ($^{238}\\mathrm{U}$, $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$) are unaffected. The measured amounts of daughter nuclides become $(1-f)$ of what they should be. The new, measured (apparent) ratios are:\n$$\nR'_{206/238} = (1-f) R_{206/238}^{\\text{true}} = (1-f)[\\exp(\\lambda_{238} t) - 1]\n$$\n$$\nR'_{207/235} = (1-f) R_{207/235}^{\\text{true}} = (1-f)[\\exp(\\lambda_{235} t) - 1]\n$$\nThe apparent ages, $t'_{206/238}$ and $t'_{207/235}$, are calculated by inserting these measured ratios back into the age equation:\n$$\nt'_{206/238} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{238}} \\ln(1 + R'_{206/238}) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{238}} \\ln\\left(1 + (1-f)[\\exp(\\lambda_{238} t) - 1]\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt'_{207/235} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{235}} \\ln(1 + R'_{207/235}) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{235}} \\ln\\left(1 + (1-f)[\\exp(\\lambda_{235} t) - 1]\\right)\n$$\nThe two apparent ages, $t'_{206/238}$ and $t'_{207/235}$, will generally not be equal. The reason lies in the non-linear relationship between the isotopic ratio and the calculated age, and how this non-linearity is scaled by the differing decay constants.\n\nTo demonstrate this rigorously, consider the change in calculated age, $\\Delta t = t' - t$, caused by the lead loss. For a small fractional loss, we can use a differential analysis. The age $t$ is a function of the ratio $R$: $t(R) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(1+R)$. The change in age due to a change in the ratio $\\Delta R$ is approximately:\n$ \\Delta t \\approx \\frac{dt}{dR} \\Delta R $.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dt}{dR} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(1+R)}$. The change in the ratio due to lead loss is $\\Delta R = R' - R^{\\text{true}} = -f R^{\\text{true}}$.\nSubstituting these, the reduction in apparent age is:\n$$ \\Delta t \\approx \\frac{1}{\\lambda(1+R^{\\text{true}})} (-f R^{\\text{true}}) = -\\frac{f R^{\\text{true}}}{\\lambda(1+R^{\\text{true}})} $$\nSince $R^{\\text{true}} = \\exp(\\lambda t) - 1$, we have $1+R^{\\text{true}} = \\exp(\\lambda t)$. Substituting this simplifies the expression for the age reduction:\n$$ \\Delta t \\approx -\\frac{f (\\exp(\\lambda t) - 1)}{\\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)} = -\\frac{f}{\\lambda} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)) $$\nThis expression reveals that the magnitude of the age reduction, $|\\Delta t|$, depends explicitly on the decay constant $\\lambda$. As $\\lambda_{238} \\neq \\lambda_{235}$, the age reductions for the two systems will be different for the same fractional lead loss $f$ and true age $t$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{206/238} \\approx -\\frac{f}{\\lambda_{238}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{238} t))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{207/235} \\approx -\\frac{f}{\\lambda_{235}} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{235} t))\n$$\nSince $\\Delta t_{206/238} \\neq \\Delta t_{207/235}$, the resulting apparent ages $t'_{206/238} = t + \\Delta t_{206/238}$ and $t'_{207/235} = t + \\Delta t_{207/235}$ must also be different. This phenomenon is known as discordance. The root cause is the differing decay rates of the two parent isotopes, which makes the response of each chronometer to a disturbance like lead loss unique.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1438}\n$$", "id": "2719485"}, {"introduction": "While dating a single crystal is foundational, geological systems often require more sophisticated approaches.

The validation process confirms the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. We proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Isochron Equation\n\nThe age determination is based on the radioactive decay of the parent isotope $^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$ to the daughter isotope $^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$. This is a first-order kinetic process governed by the radioactive decay law. Let $N_P(t)$ be the number of parent ($^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$) atoms at time $t$ after crystallization, and $N_P(0)$ be the initial number of parent atoms at the time of crystallization ($t=0$). The number of parent atoms remaining at time $t$ is given by:\n$$ N_P(t) = N_P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant for $^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$. We shall use the notation $\\lambda_{Rb}$ for specificity.\n\nThe number of daughter ($^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$) atoms at time $t$, denoted $N_D(t)$, is the sum of the initial number of daughter atoms, $N_D(0)$, and the number of parent atoms that have decayed since $t=0$. The number of decayed parent atoms is $N_P(0) - N_P(t)$. Therefore:\n$$ N_D(t) = N_D(0) + (N_P(0) - N_P(t)) $$\nFrom the decay law, we can express the initial number of parent atoms as $N_P(0) = N_P(t) \\exp(\\lambda_{Rb} t)$. Substituting this into the equation for $N_D(t)$:\n$$ N_D(t) = N_D(0) + N_P(t) \\exp(\\lambda_{Rb} t) - N_P(t) $$\n$$ N_D(t) = N_D(0) + N_P(t) (\\exp(\\lambda_{Rb} t) - 1) $$\nThis equation relates the number of parent and daughter atoms at any time $t$. In mass spectrometry, it is standard practice to measure isotope ratios rather than absolute numbers of atoms. We normalize by a stable, non-radiogenic isotope of the daughter element, which in this case is $^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$. Let $N_S$ be the number of $^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$ atoms, which is constant over time. Dividing the entire equation by $N_S$:\n$$ \\frac{N_D(t)}{N_S} = \\frac{N_D(0)}{N_S} + \\frac{N_P(t)}{N_S} (\\exp(\\lambda_{Rb} t) - 1) $$\nSubstituting the specific isotopes:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}}{^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}}\\right)_{t} = \\left(\\frac{^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}}{^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}}\\right)_{0} + \\left(\\frac{^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}}{^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}}\\right)_{t} (\\exp(\\lambda_{Rb} t) - 1) $$\nThis is the isochron equation.

This value is assumed to be the same for all cogenetic samples.\n- $m = \\exp(\\lambda_{Rb} t) - 1$ is the slope of the line.\n\nThe physical meaning of the slope $m$ is that it is a function of the age of the samples, $t$, and the decay constant, $\\lambda_{Rb}$. By measuring the slope of the line (the isochron) defined by a set of cogenetic samples, one can determine the age $t$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Slope $m$ by Ordinary Least Squares\n\nWe are given $n=4$ data points $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x \\equiv \\,^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}/^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$ and $y \\equiv \\,^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$.\nThe data are:\n$x = [\\,0.2,\\,0.4,\\,0.6,\\,0.8\\,]$\n$y = [\\,0.7042,\\,0.7046,\\,0.7050,\\,0.7055\\,]$\n\nThe slope $m$ of the best-fit line using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is given by the formula:\n$$ m = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i y_i) - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\\right)}{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i^2) - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\right)^2} $$\nWe compute the necessary sums:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i = 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.8 = 2.0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} y_i = 0.7042 + 0.7046 + 0.7050 + 0.7055 = 2.8193 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i^2 = (0.2)^2 + (0.4)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (0.8)^2 = 0.04 + 0.16 + 0.36 + 0.64 = 1.20 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} (x_i y_i) = (0.2)(0.7042) + (0.4)(0.7046) + (0.6)(0.7050) + (0.8)(0.7055) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} (x_i y_i) = 0.14084 + 0.28184 + 0.42300 + 0.56440 = 1.41008 $$\nNow, we substitute these sums into the formula for the slope $m$:\n$$ m = \\frac{4(1.41008) - (2.0)(2.8193)}{4(1.20) - (2.0)^2} = \\frac{5.64032 - 5.6386}{4.8 - 4.0} = \\frac{0.00172}{0.8} = 0.00215 $$\nThe problem requires the slope to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ m = 0.002150 $$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the Crystallization Age $t$\n\nFrom Part 1, the relationship between the slope $m$, the age $t$, and the decay constant $\\lambda_{Rb}$ is:\n$$ m = \\exp(\\lambda_{Rb} t) - 1 $$\nWe solve this equation for the age $t$:\n$$ m + 1 = \\exp(\\lambda_{Rb} t) $$\n$$ \\ln(m + 1) = \\lambda_{Rb} t $$\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(m + 1)}{\\lambda_{Rb}} $$\nWe are given the decay constant $\\lambda_{Rb} = 1.42 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and we have calculated the slope $m = 0.00215$.

Their variances are:\n$$ \\sigma_A^2 = (0.04)^2 = 0.0016 \\, \\text{Ma}^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_B^2 = (0.03)^2 = 0.0009 \\, \\text{Ma}^2 $$\n\nWe are tasked with computing the Bayes factor $K$ in favor of hypothesis $H_B$ over $H_A$:\n$$ K = \\frac{P(\\text{data}|H_B)}{P(\\text{data}|H_A)} $$\nwhere $P(\\text{data}|H)$ is the marginal likelihood, or evidence, for a given hypothesis.\n\nUnder hypothesis $H_A$, the measurements $t_1$ and $t_A$ are estimates of a single common true age $\\tau$. Assuming the errors are normally distributed, the likelihood of observing the data given $\\tau$ is:\n$$ P(t_1, t_A | \\tau, H_A) = P(t_1 | \\tau) P(t_A | \\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_{1, tot}^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t_1 - \\tau)^2}{2\\sigma_{1, tot}^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_A^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t_A - \\tau)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2}\\right) $$\nThe marginal likelihood $P(t_1, t_A|H_A)$ is obtained by integrating over all possible values of the unknown true age $\\tau$:\n$$ P(t_1, t_A|H_A) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(t_1, t_A | \\tau, H_A) P(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nWe assume a non-informative, improper uniform prior for the location parameter $\\tau$, such that $P(\\tau) \\propto 1$. The integral, a convolution of two Gaussian functions, results in a Gaussian function for the difference of the means. Specifically, the difference between two independent normal random variables $X_1 \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma_1^2)$ and $X_2 \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma_2^2)$ follows a normal distribution $X_1 - X_2 \\sim N(0, \\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2)$. The marginal likelihood is the probability density of this distribution evaluated at the observed difference $t_1 - t_A$.\n\nFor hypothesis $H_A$, the total variance of the difference is $\\Sigma_A^2 = \\sigma_{1, tot}^2 + \\sigma_A^2$, and the difference in ages is $\\Delta_A = t_1 - t_A$. The marginal likelihood for $H_A$ is:\n$$ P(\\text{data}_A|H_A) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\Sigma_A^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_A^2}{2\\Sigma_A^2}\\right) $$\nNumerically:\n$$ \\Delta_A = 12.18 - 12.10 = 0.08 \\, \\text{Ma} $$\n$$ \\Sigma_A^2 = 0.0040 + 0.0016 = 0.0056 \\, \\text{Ma}^2 $$\nThe evidence for $H_A$ is:\n$$ L_A = P(\\text{data}_A|H_A) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(0.0056)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(0.08)^2}{2(0.0056)}\\right) $$\n\nSimilarly, for hypothesis $H_B$, the total variance of the difference is $\\Sigma_B^2 = \\sigma_{1, tot}^2 + \\sigma_B^2$, and the difference in ages is $\\Delta_B = t_1 - t_B$. The marginal likelihood for $H_B$ is:\n$$ P(\\text{data}_B|H_B) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\Sigma_B^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_B^2}{2\\Sigma_B^2}\\right) $$\nNumerically:\n$$ \\Delta_B = 12.18 - 12.24 = -0.06 \\, \\text{Ma} $$\n$$ \\Sigma_B^2 = 0.0040 + 0.0009 = 0.0049 \\, \\text{Ma}^2 $$\nThe evidence for $H_B$ is:\n$$ L_B = P(\\text{data}_B|H_B) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(0.0049)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(-0.06)^2}{2(0.0049)}\\right) $$\n\nThe Bayes factor $K$ is the ratio of these evidences:\n$$ K = \\frac{L_B}{L_A} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\Sigma_B^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_B^2}{2\\Sigma_B^2}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\Sigma_A^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_A^2}{2\\Sigma_A^2}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma_A^2}{\\Sigma_B^2}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_A^2}{2\\Sigma_A^2} - \\frac{\\Delta_B^2}{2\\Sigma_B^2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ K = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0056}{0.0049}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{(0.08)^2}{2(0.0056)} - \\frac{(-0.06)^2}{2(0.0049)}\\right) $$\n$$ K = \\sqrt{\\frac{56}{49}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.0064}{0.0112} - \\frac{0.0036}{0.0098}\\right) $$\n$$ K = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{7}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{4}{7} - \\frac{18}{49}\\right) $$\n$$ K = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{7}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{28}{49} - \\frac{18}{49}\\right) $$\n$$ K = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{7}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{10}{49}\\right) $$\nEvaluating this expression:\n$$ K \\approx \\sqrt{1.142857} \\exp(0.204082) \\approx (1.069045)(1.226383) \\approx 1.310903 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $1.31$.
