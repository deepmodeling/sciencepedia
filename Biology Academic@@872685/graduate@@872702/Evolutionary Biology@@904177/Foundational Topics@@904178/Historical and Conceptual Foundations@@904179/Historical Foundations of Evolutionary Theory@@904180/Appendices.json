It presents a standard exercise in population genetics that is solvable with the provided data and definitions. The problem is valid, and we shall proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the given information. The observed counts for the three genotypes at a single biallelic locus are given as:\n- a count of $45$ for genotype $AA$, which we denote as $O_{AA} = 45$.\n- a count of $30$ for genotype $Aa$, which we denote as $O_{Aa} = 30$.\n- a count of $25$ for genotype $aa$, which we denote as $O_{aa} = 25$.\n\nThe total number of individuals in the sample, $N$, is the sum of these observed counts:\n$$N = O_{AA} + O_{Aa} + O_{aa} = 45 + 30 + 25 = 100$$\n\nThe first task is to estimate the frequency of the allele $A$, which we denote as $p$. According to the counting method, the frequency of an allele is its total count in the population divided by the total number of all alleles at that locus. Since the population is diploid, the total number of alleles is $2N$.\nThe number of $A$ alleles is derived from the genotypes. Each $AA$ individual has two $A$ alleles, and each $Aa$ individual has one $A$ allele. Therefore, the total count of allele $A$ is:\n$$\\text{Count}(A) = 2 \\times O_{AA} + 1 \\times O_{Aa} = 2(45) + 30 = 90 + 30 = 120$$\nThe frequency $p$ of allele $A$ is then:\n$$p = \\frac{\\text{Count}(A)}{2N} = \\frac{120}{2(100)} = \\frac{120}{200} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nThe frequency of the other allele, $a$, denoted as $q$, must satisfy the condition $p + q = 1$. Thus:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\nWe can verify this by counting the $a$ alleles:\n$$\\text{Count}(a) = 2 \\times O_{aa} + 1 \\times O_{Aa} = 2(25) + 30 = 50 + 30 = 80$$\n$$q = \\frac{\\text{Count}(a)}{2N} = \\frac{80}{200} = \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\nThe second task is to determine the expected genotype counts under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) using the estimated allele frequencies. The HWE principle predicts the genotype frequencies from allele frequencies as follows:\n- Expected frequency of $AA$ is $p^2$.\n- Expected frequency of $Aa$ is $2pq$.\n- Expected frequency of $aa$ is $q^2$.\n\nUsing our estimated values for $p$ and $q$:\n$$p = \\frac{3}{5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\frac{2}{5}$$\nThe expected genotype counts ($E$) in a sample of size $N=100$ are:\n$$E_{AA} = N \\times p^2 = 100 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = 100 \\times \\frac{9}{25} = 4 \\times 9 = 36$$\n$$E_{Aa} = N \\times (2pq) = 100 \\times \\left(2 \\times \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 100 \\times \\frac{12}{25} = 4 \\times 12 = 48$$\n$$E_{aa} = N \\times q^2 = 100 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = 100 \\times \\frac{4}{25} = 4 \\times 4 = 16$$\nAs a check, the sum of expected counts is $36 + 48 + 16 = 100$, which equals the total sample size $N$.\n\nThe final task is to compute the Pearson chi-square ($\\chi^2$) statistic, which is defined as:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{\\text{genotypes}} \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}}$$\nSubstituting our observed ($O$) and expected ($E$) values:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(O_{AA} - E_{AA})^2}{E_{AA}} + \\frac{(O_{Aa} - E_{Aa})^2}{E_{Aa}} + \\frac{(O_{aa} - E_{aa})^2}{E_{aa}}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(45 - 36)^2}{36} + \\frac{(30 - 48)^2}{48} + \\frac{(25 - 16)^2}{16}$$\nNow we perform the arithmetic:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(9)^2}{36} + \\frac{(-18)^2}{48} + \\frac{(9)^2}{16}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{81}{36} + \\frac{324}{48} + \\frac{81}{16}$$\nTo simplify the calculation, we reduce the fractions:\n$$\\frac{81}{36} = \\frac{9 \\times 9}{4 \\times 9} = \\frac{9}{4}$$\n$$\\frac{324}{48} = \\frac{162}{24} = \\frac{81}{12} = \\frac{27 \\times 3}{4 \\times 3} = \\frac{27}{4}$$\nThe third fraction, $\\frac{81}{16}$, is already in its simplest form.\nNow, we sum the terms:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{27}{4} + \\frac{81}{16}$$\nCombine the first two terms which share a common denominator:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{9 + 27}{4} + \\frac{81}{16} = \\frac{36}{4} + \\frac{81}{16} = 9 + \\frac{81}{16}$$\nTo express the result as a single fraction, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{9 \\times 16}{16} + \\frac{81}{16} = \\frac{144}{16} + \\frac{81}{16}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{144 + 81}{16} = \\frac{225}{16}$$\nThis is the final, exact value for the chi-square statistic as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{225}{16}}$$", "id": "2723383"}, {"introduction": "A major historical challenge to Darwin's original theory was the prevailing notion of \"blending inheritance,\" which would rapidly erode the very variation that natural selection requires.

We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part calculation to determine the ratio of phenotypic variance under a blending inheritance model to that under a Mendelian inheritance model. We are given a diploid population with a single biallelic locus. The alleles are $A$ and $a$, with initial frequencies in generation $G_0$ of $p=f(A)=0.6$ and $q=f(a)=0.4$. The population is assumed to be under random mating with no other evolutionary forces.

The allele frequencies in generation $G_1$ remain unchanged from $G_0$, so $p=0.6$ and $q=0.4$. The expected genotype proportions in $G_1$ are given by the Hardy-Weinberg principle:\nFrequency of $AA$: $f(\\mathrm{AA}) = p^2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36$\nFrequency of $Aa$: $f(\\mathrm{Aa}) = 2pq = 2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.48$\nFrequency of $aa$: $f(\\mathrm{aa}) = q^2 = (0.4)^2 = 0.16$\nThe sum of frequencies is $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, which is consistent.\n\nPart $2$: Additive genetic variance in $G_1$ under Mendelian inheritance.\nThe phenotypic variance of the trait $X$ in generation $G_1$, which is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, is denoted as $\\mathrm{Var}_{Mendel}(X_{G_1})$. Since the genetic model is purely additive (the heterozygote phenotype $d$ is exactly the midpoint of the homozygote phenotypes $2d$ and $0$), the total genetic variance $V_G$ is equal to the additive genetic variance $V_A$. We compute this variance using the definition $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$.\n\nThe mean phenotype $E[X]$ in generation $G_1$ is:\n$$E[X] = f(\\mathrm{AA}) \\cdot X(\\mathrm{AA}) + f(\\mathrm{Aa}) \\cdot X(\\mathrm{Aa}) + f(\\mathrm{aa}) \\cdot X(\\mathrm{aa})$$\n$$E[X] = (p^2)(2d) + (2pq)(d) + (q^2)(0) = 2dp^2 + 2dpq = 2dp(p+q)$$\nSince $p+q=1$, we have:\n$$E[X] = 2dp$$\n\nThe mean of the squared phenotype $E[X^2]$ is:\n$$E[X^2] = f(\\mathrm{AA}) \\cdot [X(\\mathrm{AA})]^2 + f(\\mathrm{Aa}) \\cdot [X(\\mathrm{Aa})]^2 + f(\\mathrm{aa}) \\cdot [X(\\mathrm{aa})]^2$$\n$$E[X^2] = (p^2)(2d)^2 + (2pq)(d)^2 + (q^2)(0)^2 = 4d^2p^2 + 2d^2pq$$\n\nThe variance is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}_{Mendel}(X_{G_1}) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = (4d^2p^2 + 2d^2pq) - (2dp)^2$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}_{Mendel}(X_{G_1}) = 4d^2p^2 + 2d^2pq - 4d^2p^2 = 2d^2pq$$\nThis is the standard formula for additive genetic variance at a single locus with purely additive effects. Substituting the given values $p=0.6$ and $q=0.4$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}_{Mendel}(X_{G_1}) = 2d^2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.48d^2$$\n\nSecond, we analyze the hypothetical case of blending inheritance.\n\nPart $3$: Phenotypic variance in $G_1$ under blending inheritance.\nUnder this model, the phenotype of an offspring, $X_{offspring}$, is the exact mid-parent value:\n$$X_{offspring} = \\frac{X_{parent1} + X_{parent2}}{2}$$\nThe problem states that mating is random, so the parental phenotypes $X_{parent1}$ and $X_{parent2}$ are independent and identically distributed random variables. Their distribution is that of the parental generation, $G_0$. The problem provides allele frequencies for $G_0$, and the most logical interpretation, standard in such problems, is that generation $G_0$ is already at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Thus, the variance of the trait in the parental population is $\\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent}) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{G_0})$. This variance is calculated in the same way as for $G_1$ under the Mendelian model, since the allele and genotype frequencies are identical.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent}) = 2d^2pq = 0.48d^2$$\nWe now compute the variance of the offspring generation, $\\mathrm{Var}_{Blend}(X_{G_1})$, using the properties of variance provided.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}_{Blend}(X_{G_1}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{X_{parent1} + X_{parent2}}{2}\\right) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}X_{parent1} + \\frac{1}{2}X_{parent2}\\right)$$\nBecause $X_{parent1}$ and $X_{parent2}$ are independent, we use $\\mathrm{Var}(Y_1+Y_2)=\\mathrm{Var}(Y_1)+\\mathrm{Var}(Y_2)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}_{Blend}(X_{G_1}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}X_{parent1}\\right) + \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}X_{parent2}\\right)$$\nUsing $\\mathrm{Var}(aY)=a^2\\mathrm{Var}(Y)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}_{Blend}(X_{G_1}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent1}) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent2})$$\nSince the parents are identically distributed, $\\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent1}) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent2}) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent})$.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}_{Blend}(X_{G_1}) = \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent}) + \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Var}(X_{parent})$$\nThis result shows that blending inheritance halves the phenotypic variance in each generation.

Assume no assortative mating, no dominance or epistasis contributing to transmitted value, no gene-by-environment covariance or interaction, and unbiased transmission such that the expected offspring breeding value equals the midparent breeding value.

Then, evaluate your derived expression for a case where $h^{2} = 0.4$ and $S = 1.5$ millimeters. Express your final numerical answer in millimeters and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the expected change in a mean quantitative phenotype across one generation of selection, known as the response to selection, $R$. The framework provided is that of modern quantitative genetics, which reconciles Mendelian inheritance with Darwinian selection. We must demonstrate how this framework yields a predictive equation from first principles and explain why it inherently excludes Lamarckian mechanisms such as the inheritance of acquired characteristics (use-disuse).\n\nLet $\\bar{z}$ and $\\bar{z}'$ be the mean phenotypic values of the trait in the parental generation (before selection) and the offspring generation, respectively. The response to selection is defined as the change in the mean phenotype between generations:\n$$\nR = \\bar{z}' - \\bar{z}\n$$\nThe phenotype $z$ is decomposed into an additive genetic (breeding) value $A$ and an environmental deviation $E$, such that $z = A + E$. The means are related by $\\bar{z} = \\bar{A} + \\bar{E}$ and $\\bar{z}' = \\bar{A}' + \\bar{E}'$. It is a standard assumption in such models, in the absence of systematic environmental trends, that the mean environmental deviation is zero in both generations, i.e., $\\bar{E} = \\bar{E}' = 0$. This implies that the environment does not systematically bias the phenotype in one direction or another across the entire population. With this, the response to selection becomes purely a function of the change in the mean breeding value:\n$$\nR = (\\bar{A}' + \\bar{E}') - (\\bar{A} + \\bar{E}) = \\bar{A}' - \\bar{A}\n$$\nThe core of the problem is to relate this change in mean breeding value, $\\bar{A}' - \\bar{A}$, to the action of selection on the parental generation.\n\nThe problem states that transmission is unbiased and the expected offspring breeding value equals the midparent breeding value. Let $A_o$ be the breeding value of an offspring, and $A_m$ and $A_f$ be the breeding values of its maternal and paternal parents. Then $E[A_o] = \\frac{A_m + A_f}{2}$. When we average over all offspring in the next generation, their mean breeding value $\\bar{A}'$ will be the average of the midparent breeding values of the individuals from the parental generation that were selected to reproduce.\n$$\n\\bar{A}' = E\\left[ \\frac{A_{m, \\text{selected}} + A_{f, \\text{selected}}}{2} \\right] = \\frac{\\bar{A}_{m, \\text{selected}} + \\bar{A}_{f, \\text{selected}}}{2}\n$$\nAssuming selection acts equally on both sexes, the mean breeding value of selected mothers and selected fathers is the same: $\\bar{A}_{m, \\text{selected}} = \\bar{A}_{f, \\text{selected}} = \\bar{A}_{\\text{selected}}$. Thus, the mean breeding value in the offspring generation equals the mean breeding value of the selected parents:\n$$\n\\bar{A}' = \\bar{A}_{\\text{selected}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our equation for $R$, we find that the response to selection is equal to the deviation of the mean breeding value of selected parents from the mean breeding value of their entire generation before selection:\n$$\nR = \\bar{A}_{\\text{selected}} - \\bar{A}\n$$\nSelection, however, acts on the phenotype $z$, not directly on the breeding value $A$. The intensity of selection is quantified by the selection differential, $S$, which is the change in the mean phenotype caused by selection within the parental generation:\n$$\nS = \\bar{z}_{\\text{selected}} - \\bar{z}\n$$\nWe must now connect the selection on phenotypes ($S$) to the change in the mean breeding value of the selected group ($R$). This is a problem of statistical association. The change in the mean of one variable ($A$) that results from selecting on a correlated variable ($z$) can be described by linear regression. The regression of the breeding value $A$ on the phenotype $z$ gives the expected change in $A$ for a unit change in $z$. The slope of this regression, $b_{Az}$, is:\n$$\nb_{Az} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(A, z)}{\\operatorname{Var}(z)}\n$$\nThe relationship between the deviations of the means is therefore $(\\bar{A}_{\\text{selected}} - \\bar{A}) = b_{Az} (\\bar{z}_{\\text{selected}} - \\bar{z})$. Substituting the definitions for $R$ and $S$:\n$$\nR = b_{Az} S\n$$\nNow we must evaluate the regression coefficient $b_{Az}$ using the given information. The denominator is the phenotypic variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(z) = V_P$. For the numerator, we use the decomposition $z=A+E$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(A, z) = \\operatorname{Cov}(A, A+E) = \\operatorname{Cov}(A, A) + \\operatorname{Cov}(A, E)\n$$\nBy definition, $\\operatorname{Cov}(A, A) = \\operatorname{Var}(A) = V_A$. The problem states that $\\operatorname{Cov}(A, E) = 0$. This crucial assumption of no covariance between genotype and environment means that the genetic and environmental contributions to the phenotype are uncorrelated. Therefore:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(A, z) = V_A\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the regression coefficient:\n$$\nb_{Az} = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}\n$$\nThis ratio is, by definition, the narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$. Thus, $b_{Az} = h^2$.\nFinally, we substitute this result into our equation for the response, $R = b_{Az} S$, to obtain the fundamental quantitative genetic relationship known as the breeder's equation:\n$$\nR = h^2 S\n$$\nThis equation predicts the evolutionary change in the mean phenotype as a product of the heritability of the trait and the strength of selection acting on it.\n\nThe reason this derivation requires no appeal to Lamarckian use-disuse processes is that the model's fundamental assumptions explicitly preclude them. The decomposition $z = A + E$ separates the phenotype into a heritable component ($A$) and a non-heritable component ($E$). The component $E$ represents any modification to the phenotype acquired during an individual's life due to environmental factors, which is analogous to traits acquired through \"use or disuse.\" The rules of inheritance specified in the problem state that only the breeding value $A$ is transmitted to offspring. The environmental deviation $E$ of a parent has no influence on the phenotype of its offspring. This non-transmission of acquired traits is the central tenet of the modern synthesis and the primary refutation of Lamarckism. If Lamarckian inheritance were operational, the environmental component $E$ (or some part of it) would also be heritable, and the transmission rules would need to be modified, fundamentally altering the derivation. Our derivation is built upon a Mendelian framework where inheritance is particulate (genes) and non-somatic, so the concept of use-disuse is irrelevant from the start.\n\nNow we evaluate the derived expression for the given values: $h^2 = 0.4$ and $S = 1.5$ millimeters.\n$$\nR = h^2 S = (0.4) \\times (1.5 \\, \\text{mm}) = 0.6 \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nR = 0.600 \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nThis is the expected change in the mean beak length in the offspring generation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.600}\n$$", "id": "2723384"}]}
