It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in theoretical evolutionary biology concerning the error threshold for replication.\n\nWe begin by establishing the mathematical framework based on the provided assumptions. Let $x_0(t)$ be the frequency of the master genotype and $x_m(t)$ be the total frequency of all mutant genotypes in an infinite population at time $t$. By definition, $x_0(t) + x_m(t) = 1$.\n\nThe master genotype has a length of $L$ nucleotides. The per-site, per-replication error probability is $\\mu$. According to the problem statement, copying events at each site are independent. Therefore, the probability $Q$ of an entire genome of length $L$ being replicated without any errors (i.e., producing an identical copy of the master genotype) is the product of the probabilities of correctly copying each of the $L$ sites:\n$$ Q = (1-\\mu)^{L} $$\n\nThe dynamics of the population are described by a continuous-time Malthusian growth model. Let $N_0(t)$ and $N_m(t)$ be the number of individuals of the master and mutant types, respectively. The total population size is $N(t) = N_0(t) + N_m(t)$.\n\nThe master genotype replicates at a rate $r_0$. Progeny are of the master type only if replication is error-free, which occurs with probability $Q$. Thus, the rate of change in the number of master individuals is:\n$$ \\frac{dN_0}{dt} = N_0(t) \\cdot r_0 \\cdot Q $$\nWe assume back-mutation from a mutant to the master sequence is negligible, so there is no other source term for $N_0$.\n\nMutant genotypes are produced in two ways: from master genotypes replicating with errors (with probability $1-Q$) and from mutant genotypes replicating. All mutants are assumed to have the same average replication rate $r_m$. Therefore, the rate of change in the number of mutant individuals is:\n$$ \\frac{dN_m}{dt} = N_0(t) \\cdot r_0 \\cdot (1-Q) + N_m(t) \\cdot r_m $$\n\nThe rate of change of the total population size is the sum of these rates:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{dN_0}{dt} + \\frac{dN_m}{dt} = N_0(t) r_0 Q + N_0(t) r_0 (1-Q) + N_m(t) r_m = N_0(t) r_0 + N_m(t) r_m $$\n\nWe are interested in the frequency of the master genotype, $x_0 = N_0/N$. We can find the differential equation for $x_0(t)$ using the quotient rule:\n$$ \\frac{dx_0}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{dN_0}{dt} - \\frac{N_0}{N^2} \\frac{dN}{dt} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{dx_0}{dt} = \\frac{N_0 r_0 Q}{N} - \\frac{N_0}{N} \\left(\\frac{N_0 r_0 + N_m r_m}{N}\\right) $$\nRecognizing that $x_0 = N_0/N$ and $x_m = N_m/N$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dx_0}{dt} = x_0 r_0 Q - x_0 (x_0 r_0 + x_m r_m) $$\nThe term $\\bar{r}(t) = x_0(t) r_0 + x_m(t) r_m$ is the mean Malthusian growth rate of the population. The equation is a form of the replicator equation:\n$$ \\frac{dx_0}{dt} = x_0 (r_0 Q - \\bar{r}) $$\n\nTo analyze the condition for the master genotype to be maintained, we must determine when it can persist at a positive frequency at mutation-selection balance. This occurs if the master genotype can invade a population composed almost entirely of mutants. In other words, its frequency must increase when it is very low. Mathematically, this means we require $\\frac{dx_0}{dt} > 0$ as $x_0 \\to 0^{+}$.\n\nIn the limit where $x_0 \\to 0$, we have $x_m \\to 1$.

We now solve for the error rate $\\mu$.\n$$ r_0 Q > r_m $$\nSubstitute the expressions for $Q = (1-\\mu)^L$ and the relative advantage $\\sigma = r_0/r_m$:\n$$ r_0 (1-\\mu)^{L} > r_m $$\n$$ \\frac{r_0}{r_m} (1-\\mu)^{L} > 1 $$\n$$ \\sigma (1-\\mu)^{L} > 1 $$\nSince $\\sigma > 1$, we can rearrange the inequality:\n$$ (1-\\mu)^{L} > \\frac{1}{\\sigma} $$\nTaking the $L$-th root of both sides (which is a monotonic operation for positive numbers):\n$$ 1 - \\mu > \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\right)^{1/L} $$\n$$ 1 - \\mu > \\sigma^{-1/L} $$\nFinally, we isolate $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu < 1 - \\sigma^{-1/L} $$\nThis inequality gives the range of per-site error probabilities for which the master genotype can be maintained in the population.

I will therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem describes one-dimensional diffusion with a zero-order reaction at steady state. The governing equation is derived from a mass balance on a differential volume element of the tissue. At steady state, the divergence of the diffusive flux must be balanced by the rate of consumption. As $q$ is a consumption rate (a sink), the mass balance is:\n$$ \\frac{dJ_x}{dx} + q = 0 $$\nwhere $J_x$ is the diffusive flux in the $x$ direction (mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$).
