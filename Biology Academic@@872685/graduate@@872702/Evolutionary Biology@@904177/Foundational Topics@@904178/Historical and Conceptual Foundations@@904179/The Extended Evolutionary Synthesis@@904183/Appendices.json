It is mathematically well-defined, scientifically grounded in established evolutionary theory, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. It is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe Malthusian fitness, denoted by $m$, is defined as the natural logarithm of the Darwinian fitness, $W$.\nThe fitness function is given as $W = \\exp\\big(-s\\,(z - \\theta)^{2}\\big)$, where $z$ is the phenotype, $\\theta$ is the environmental optimum, and $s > 0$ is the strength of stabilizing selection.\nThe Malthusian fitness is thus:\n$$m = \\ln(W) = \\ln\\left(\\exp\\big(-s\\,(z - \\theta)^{2}\\big)\\right) = -s(z - \\theta)^2$$\nThe phenotype $z$ is determined by a linear reaction norm $z(E) = \\alpha + \\beta E$, where $E$ is an environmental cue, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are genetically determined parameters. Substituting this into the expression for $m$:\n$$m = -s(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta)^2$$\nEvolutionary change is assumed to follow the gradient of the expected Malthusian fitness, $\\mathbb{E}[m]$. The environment is stochastic, with the cue $E$ and the optimum $\\theta$ being jointly Gaussian random variables. We must compute the expectation of $m$ over the joint distribution of $E$ and $\\theta$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[m] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[-s(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta)^2\\right] = -s\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta)^2\\right]$$\nThe problem asks for the selection gradient on the reaction norm slope, $\\beta$. This is the partial derivative of the expected Malthusian fitness with respect to $\\beta$. We denote this gradient as $\\mathcal{S}_{\\beta}$.\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{\\beta} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{E}[m]}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left(-s\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta)^2\\right]\\right)$$\nSince the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are independent of the random variables $E$ and $\\theta$, we can interchange the differentiation and expectation operators (Leibniz rule).\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{\\beta} = -s \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta)^2\\right]$$\nWe compute the partial derivative inside the expectation using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta)^2 = 2(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta) = 2(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta) \\cdot E$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the gradient:\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{\\beta} = -s \\mathbb{E}\\left[2E(\\alpha + \\beta E - \\theta)\\right] = -2s \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\alpha E + \\beta E^2 - E\\theta\\right]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator, we can separate the terms:\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{\\beta} = -2s \\left(\\alpha\\mathbb{E}[E] + \\beta\\mathbb{E}[E^2] - \\mathbb{E}[E\\theta]\\right)$$\nThis is the selection gradient on $\\beta$ expressed in terms of the moments of $E$ and $\\theta$. We now use the statistical properties provided in the problem statement:\n1.  The means are zero: $\\mathbb{E}[E] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\theta] = 0$.\n2.  The variances are $\\operatorname{Var}(E) = \\sigma_{E}^{2}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta) = \\sigma_{\\theta}^{2}$. By definition, $\\operatorname{Var}(E) = \\mathbb{E}[E^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[E])^2$. With $\\mathbb{E}[E] = 0$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[E^2] = \\sigma_{E}^{2}$.\n3.  The correlation is $\\operatorname{Corr}(E,\\theta) = \\rho$. The covariance is defined as $\\operatorname{Cov}(E,\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[E\\theta] - \\mathbb{E}[E]\\mathbb{E}[\\theta]$. With zero means, this simplifies to $\\operatorname{Cov}(E,\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[E\\theta]$. The correlation is related to the covariance by $\\rho = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(E,\\theta)}{\\sigma_E \\sigma_\\theta}$.

To find the evolutionarily stable, or optimal, value of $\\beta$ that maximizes the expected fitness, we set this gradient to zero:\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{\\beta} = -2s(\\beta \\sigma_{E}^{2} - \\rho \\sigma_{E} \\sigma_{\\theta}) = 0$$\nSince selection is non-zero ($s > 0$), the quantity in the parentheses must be zero for the equation to hold:\n$$\\beta \\sigma_{E}^{2} - \\rho \\sigma_{E} \\sigma_{\\theta} = 0$$\nSolving for $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta \\sigma_{E}^{2} = \\rho \\sigma_{E} \\sigma_{\\theta}$$\nAssuming that the environmental cue has non-zero variance ($\\sigma_{E}^{2} > 0$), which is a necessary condition for plasticity to be a meaningful concept, we can divide by $\\sigma_{E}^{2}$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{\\rho \\sigma_{E} \\sigma_{\\theta}}{\\sigma_{E}^{2}}$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the optimal reaction norm slope:\n$$\\beta = \\rho \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}}{\\sigma_{E}}$$\nThis result is intuitive: the optimal plastic response $\\beta$ is the slope of the linear regression of the selective optimum $\\theta$ on the environmental cue $E$. The response is scaled by the reliability of the cue, $\\rho$, and the relative amount of variation in the optimum versus the cue, $\\sigma_{\\theta}/\\sigma_{E}$. If the cue is perfectly reliable ($\\rho = 1$), the slope matches the ratio of standard deviations. If the cue is uninformative ($\\rho = 0$), the optimal plastic response is zero slope ($\\beta = 0$), meaning no plasticity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\rho \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}}{\\sigma_{E}}}$$", "id": "2757784"}, {"introduction": "The EES reframes organisms as active agents that modify their own selective environments, a process known as niche construction.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in theoretical biology that admits a unique solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Part 1: Decomposition of the Selection Gradient**\nThe fitness of a resident individual with trait $z$ is evaluated at the environmental equilibrium $E^{\\ast}(z)$ that this resident population creates. The fitness is therefore a function of $z$ both directly and indirectly through $E^{\\ast}(z)$, i.e., $W(z, E^{\\ast}(z))$. To find the total selection gradient, we compute the total derivative of $W$ with respect to $z$ using the multivariable chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dz}W\\big(z,E^{\\ast}(z)\\big) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{(z,E^{\\ast}(z))} \\;+\\; \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E}\\bigg|_{(z,E^{\\ast}(z))} \\frac{dE^{\\ast}}{dz}\n$$\nThis expression provides the requested decomposition. The term $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial z}$ represents the direct selection on the trait $z$, which is the selection that would occur if the environment were fixed. The term $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E} \\frac{dE^{\\ast}}{dz}$ represents the indirect, environment-mediated selection component. This component arises because a change in the trait $z$ modifies the environment ($\\frac{dE^{\\ast}}{dz}$), which in turn affects fitness ($\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E}$). This is precisely the feedback loop central to the concept of niche construction.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of the Environment-Mediated Component**\nWe must compute the value of the environment-mediated component at the resident trait value $z_0 = 1.5$. This requires finding expressions for $E^{\\ast}(z)$, $\\frac{dE^{\\ast}}{dz}$, and $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E}$, and then substituting the given parameter values.\n\nFirst, we determine the ecological equilibrium $E^{\\ast}(z)$ by setting $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$ in the environmental dynamics equation:\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; r(E_b - E^{\\ast}) \\;+\\; \\nu z \\;-\\; \\kappa z E^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving for $E^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nr E^{\\ast} + \\kappa z E^{\\ast} \\;=\\; r E_b + \\nu z \\\\\nE^{\\ast}(r + \\kappa z) \\;=\\; r E_b + \\nu z \\\\\nE^{\\ast}(z) \\;=\\; \\frac{r E_b + \\nu z}{r + \\kappa z}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the sensitivity of the equilibrium environment to the trait, $\\frac{dE^{\\ast}}{dz}$, using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dE^{\\ast}}{dz} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\nu(r + \\kappa z) - \\kappa(r E_b + \\nu z)}{(r + \\kappa z)^2} \\\\\n\\;=\\; \\frac{r\\nu + \\kappa\\nu z - r\\kappa E_b - \\kappa\\nu z}{(r + \\kappa z)^2} \\\\\n\\;=\\; \\frac{r(\\nu - \\kappa E_b)}{(r + \\kappa z)^2}\n$$\n\nThen, we find the sensitivity of fitness to the environment, $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E}$, by differentiating $W(z,E)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left[ W_b \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z - E)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\right] \\\\\n\\;=\\; W_b \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z - E)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\cdot 2(z-E) \\cdot (-1) \\right) \\\\\n\\;=\\; W(z,E) \\frac{z-E}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\n\nNow we proceed with numerical evaluation at $z_0 = 1.5$. The parameter values are $r=1.2$, $E_b=1.0$, $\\nu=0.6$, $\\kappa=0.4$, $W_b=3.0$, and $\\sigma=0.7$.\n\n1.

The covariance is thus $(\\frac{1}{2})^{j+1} V_G$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(G_t, z_t) = a \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} m^j \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{j+1} V_G = \\frac{a V_G}{2} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{m}{2}\\right)^j\n$$\nThis is a geometric series which converges because $|m|<1$ implies $|m/2|<1$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(G_t, z_t) = \\frac{a V_G}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{1-m/2}\\right) = \\frac{a V_G}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{2-m}\\right) = \\frac{a V_G}{2-m}\n$$\nSubstituting this covariance back into the equation for $V_z$:\n$$\n(1-m^2) V_z = a^2 V_G + 2am \\left(\\frac{a V_G}{2-m}\\right) + V_E\n$$\n$$\n(1-m^2) V_z = a^2 V_G \\left(1 + \\frac{2m}{2-m}\\right) + V_E = a^2 V_G \\left(\\frac{2-m+2m}{2-m}\\right) + V_E\n$$\n$$\n(1-m^2) V_z = a^2 V_G \\left(\\frac{2+m}{2-m}\\right) + V_E\n$$\nThus, the total stationary phenotypic variance is:\n$$\nV_z = \\operatorname{Var}(z_{t+1}) = \\frac{1}{1-m^2} \\left[a^2 V_G \\left(\\frac{2+m}{2-m}\\right) + V_E\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator of $h^{2}_{\\infty}$, which is the variance of the total genetic contribution to the phenotype, let's call it $V_{G,total}$.\n$$\nV_{G,total} = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a m^k G_{t-k}\\right) = a^2 \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} m^k G_{t-k}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_{G,total} = a^2 \\operatorname{Cov}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} m^i G_{t-i}, \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} m^j G_{t-j}\\right) = a^2 \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} m^{i+j} \\operatorname{Cov}(G_{t-i}, G_{t-j})\n$$\nThe covariance can be generalized as $\\operatorname{Cov}(G_u, G_v) = (\\frac{1}{2})^{|u-v|} V_G$.
