It requires the derivation of the population mean phenotype and the additive genetic variance from first principles under a simple additive model. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem specifies a large, randomly mating diploid population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for a single biallelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$. The frequencies of these alleles are given as $p$ and $q$, respectively, with $p+q=1$. Under random mating, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes, $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, are given by the Hardy–Weinberg principle as $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$.\n\nThe genotypic values ($z$) are specified as:\n$z_{AA} = +a$\n$z_{Aa} = 0$\n$z_{aa} = -a$\nwhere $a > 0$ is a constant. The problem states that gene action is purely additive, which implies two critical points: first, the heterozygote's phenotypic value is exactly intermediate to the two homozygotes, and second, the breeding value of an individual is equal to its genotypic value. Consequently, the total genetic variance ($V_G$) is equal to the additive genetic variance ($V_A$).\n\nFirst, we derive the mean phenotype of the population, denoted as $\\bar{z}$. The mean is the expected value of the genotypic value, calculated as the weighted average of the genotypic values, with the weights being the corresponding genotype frequencies.\n\n$$\n\\bar{z} = E[z] = (p^2) \\cdot z_{AA} + (2pq) \\cdot z_{Aa} + (q^2) \\cdot z_{aa}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given genotypic values:\n$$\n\\bar{z} = (p^2)(+a) + (2pq)(0) + (q^2)(-a)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{z} = a p^2 - a q^2 = a(p^2 - q^2)\n$$\n\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring the difference of squares, $p^2 - q^2 = (p-q)(p+q)$. Since $p+q=1$, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{z} = a(p-q)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the additive genetic variance, $V_A$. As established, for this purely additive model, $V_A = V_G$. The variance of a random variable is defined as the expectation of the squared deviation from the mean, $V_G = E[(z-\\bar{z})^2]$, or equivalently, $V_G = E[z^2] - (E[z])^2 = E[z^2] - \\bar{z}^2$.

The problem is well-posed; it provides sufficient information to establish a relationship and solve for the unknown variable $V_E$. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The given values are consistent and plausible for a theoretical model.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe fundamental principle is the decomposition of phenotypic variance. Given no epistasis and assuming no genotype-environment correlation or interaction (implied by the simple sum $P=G+E$), the total phenotypic variance in generation $0$, denoted $V_{P,0}$, is:\n$$V_{P,0} = V_{G,0} + V_{E,0}$$\nwhere $V_{G,0}$ is the genetic variance and $V_{E,0}$ is the environmental variance. The problem states $V_E$ is constant, so we denote it simply as $V_E$. The genetic variance is further decomposed into additive ($V_A$) and dominance ($V_D$) components:\n$$V_{G,0} = V_{A,0} + V_{D,0}$$\nWe are given $V_{P,0} = 4$ and $h^2=0.25$. By definition, narrow-sense heritability is $h^2 = V_{A,0} / V_{P,0}$. We can calculate the additive genetic variance in generation $0$:\n$$V_{A,0} = h^2 \\times V_{P,0} = 0.25 \\times 4 = 1$$\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the phenotypic variance in generation $1$ ($V_{P,1}$) under two different inheritance models and set them equal.\n\n**Case 1: Particulate (Mendelian) Inheritance**\nThe problem describes a large, randomly mating population with no selection, mutation, or migration. These are the classic conditions for a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In such a population, allele frequencies are constant, and consequently, the statistical distributions of breeding values and dominance deviations are stable from one generation to the next. The environmental variance is also stated to be stable. Therefore, the total phenotypic variance is conserved across generations.\n$$V_{P, \\text{particulate}, 1} = V_{A,1} + V_{D,1} + V_{E,1} = V_{A,0} + V_{D,0} + V_{E,0} = V_{P,0}$$\nThus, for the particulate inheritance model:\n$$V_{P, \\text{particulate}, 1} = 4$$\n\n**Case 2: Blending Inheritance**\nThe model for an offspring's phenotype is given as $P_{O,1} = \\frac{P_{P1,0} + P_{P2,0}}{2} + E_O$. We must find the variance of this quantity across all possible offspring in generation $1$. This is the phenotypic variance in generation $1$, $V_{P, \\text{blending}, 1}$.\n$$V_{P, \\text{blending}, 1} = V\\left( \\frac{P_{P1,0} + P_{P2,0}}{2} + E_O \\right)$$\nThe parents are drawn independently from the generation $0$ population, and the developmental noise $E_O$ is independent of the parental phenotypes. Using the properties of variance for sums of independent random variables, $V(X+Y) = V(X)+V(Y)$, and for a scaled variable, $V(aX) = a^2V(X)$:\n$$V_{P, \\text{blending}, 1} = V\\left( \\frac{P_{P1,0} + P_{P2,0}}{2} \\right) + V(E_O)$$\n$$V_{P, \\text{blending}, 1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 V(P_{P1,0} + P_{P2,0}) + V(E_O)$$\nSince the two parents are independent draws, $V(P_{P1,0} + P_{P2,0}) = V(P_{P1,0}) + V(P_{P2,0})$. The variance of a single phenotype drawn from the generation $0$ population is, by definition, $V_{P,0}$.\n$$V(P_{P1,0}) = V_{P,0}$$\n$$V(P_{P2,0}) = V_{P,0}$$\nThe problem states that the variance of the noise term is $V(E_O) = V_E$. Substituting these into the expression for $V_{P, \\text{blending}, 1}$:\n$$V_{P, \\text{blending}, 1} = \\frac{1}{4} (V_{P,0} + V_{P,0}) + V_E = \\frac{1}{4} (2 V_{P,0}) + V_E = \\frac{1}{2} V_{P,0} + V_E$$\n\n**Equating the Variances and Solving for $V_E$**\nThe problem requires that the one-generation phenotypic variance under both models be equal:\n$$V_{P, \\text{particulate}, 1} = V_{P, \\text{blending}, 1}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$V_{P,0} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{P,0} + V_E$$\nWe can now solve for $V_E$:\n$$V_E = V_{P,0} - \\frac{1}{2} V_{P,0} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{P,0}$$\nUsing the given value $V_{P,0} = 4$:\n$$V_E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2$$\n\nThis result can be validated for internal consistency using the given heritability, $h^2=0.25$.\nIf $V_E=2$ and $V_P = 4$, then the total genetic variance is $V_G = V_P - V_E = 4 - 2 = 2$.\nThe additive genetic variance was calculated as $V_A = 1$.\nThe dominance variance is then $V_D = V_G - V_A = 2 - 1 = 1$.\nSince $V_A$, $V_D$, and $V_E$ are all non-negative, the solution is physically and mathematically consistent. The information on narrow-sense heritability, while not required for the primary derivation, confirms the coherence of the problem statement and its solution. The blending model fails to conserve heritable variation, and for the total variance to remain constant, the loss must be replenished by new environmental variance in a specific ratio.\nThe unique value of $V_E$ is therefore $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2694939"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of an inheritance model is whether it can support sustained evolution by natural selection.

The initial phenotypic variance is $V_{P}=1$, and the initial variance attributable to transmissible additive effects under Mendelian inheritance (narrow-sense additive genetic variance) is $V_{A}=0.5$. In each generation, deterministic truncation selection is applied by an external breeder so that the realized phenotypic selection differential (the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents and the pre-selection population mean) is fixed at $S=1$ in trait units, independent of changes in variance across generations.\n\nTwo alternative inheritance models are considered:\n\n1. Particulate additive (Mendelian) inheritance: Assume an infinitesimal additive model with no transmission bias and random mating, so that the expected offspring phenotype is a linear regression on the midparent with slope equal to the narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$, where $h^{2}$ is defined as $h^{2}=V_{A}/V_{P}$ at the time of selection.\n\n2. Complete blending inheritance with environmental heterogeneity refreshed each generation: Offspring phenotype equals the arithmetic mean of parental phenotypes plus an independent environmental deviation. Environmental heterogeneity is such that the total phenotypic variance is maintained at $V_{P}=1$ every generation (this isolates the effect of the collapse of the transmissible component). Under random mating and complete blending, the variance carried forward by the averaged parental contribution (the transmissible component) halves each generation, so if $V_{T}(t)$ denotes the transmissible variance at generation $t$, then $V_{T}(t+1)=\\tfrac{1}{2}V_{T}(t)$ with $V_{T}(0)=V_{A}=0.5$.\n\nUsing only first principles of quantitative genetics grounded in the regression of offspring on midparent, the definition of narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$ as the ratio of additive (or transmissible) variance to phenotypic variance, and the definition of the phenotypic selection differential $S$ as above, do the following:\n\n- For the particulate additive model, derive the one-generation response of the mean, expressed in terms of $V_{A}$, $V_{P}$, and $S$, and then evaluate it at $V_{A}=0.5$, $V_{P}=1$, and $S=1$.\n\n- For the blending model, derive the per-generation response sequence under the same fixed $S=1$ applied every generation, starting at generation $t=0$, and compute the total cumulative change in the population mean across infinitely many generations.\n\nReport as your final answer the total cumulative change in the population mean across infinitely many generations under the blending model.

It represents a standard theoretical comparison between two models of inheritance, a cornerstone of classical quantitative genetics. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the response to selection is the regression of offspring phenotypes on the phenotypes of their parents. For a quantitative trait $z$, the expected deviation of an offspring's phenotype from the population mean is a linear function of the mid-parent's phenotypic deviation. The slope of this regression, $b_{O,MP}$, quantifies the degree to which phenotypic differences are transmitted across generations. This slope is, by definition, the narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$.\n\nThe response to selection, $R$, is the change in the mean phenotype of the population in one generation, $R = \\bar{z}_{\\text{offspring}} - \\bar{z}_{\\text{parental}}$. The selection differential, $S$, is the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents, $\\bar{z}_{\\text{selected}}$, and the mean of the parental generation before selection, $\\bar{z}_{\\text{parental}}$. The relationship between these quantities is given by the Breeder's Equation:\n$$\nR = b_{O,MP} S = h^{2}S\n$$\nThis equation is the first principle upon which our analysis for both models will be based. The definition of heritability, $h^2$, is the ratio of the additive genetic variance, $V_A$, to the total phenotypic variance, $V_P$. Under the particulate model, $V_A$ represents the heritable variance. In the blending model, we will use the analogous \"transmissible variance\", $V_T$.\n\nPart 1: Particulate Additive (Mendelian) Inheritance\n\nIn the Mendelian model, the narrow-sense heritability is defined as $h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}$. The problem states that this is an infinitesimal additive model, which allows us to use the variance components given for the initial generation to predict the immediate response.\nThe one-generation response of the mean, $R$, is given by the Breeder's Equation:\n$$\nR = h^2 S = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} S\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the one-generation response. We are asked to evaluate this for the initial condition of the population. The given values are:\nInitial additive genetic variance, $V_A = 0.5$.\nInitial phenotypic variance, $V_P = 1$.\nSelection differential, $S = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for response:\n$$\nR = \\frac{0.5}{1} \\times 1 = 0.5\n$$\nThus, the one-generation response under the particulate model is $0.5$. Under the ideal conditions of the infinitesimal model (where selection does not erode $V_A$ immediately), this response would continue for multiple generations, leading to a sustained increase in the population mean.\n\nPart 2: Complete Blending Inheritance\n\nIn the blending inheritance model, the concept of heritability must be adapted. The \"transmissible variance\", $V_T(t)$, at generation $t$ takes the place of the additive genetic variance $V_A$. The narrow-sense heritability at generation $t$, which we may denote $h_B^2(t)$, is the ratio of this transmissible variance to the total phenotypic variance, $V_P(t)$:\n$$\nh_B^2(t) = \\frac{V_T(t)}{V_P(t)}\n$$\nThe problem states that environmental heterogeneity is such that the total phenotypic variance is replenished to $V_P(t) = 1$ in every generation. Therefore, the heritability simplifies to:\n$$\nh_B^2(t) = \\frac{V_T(t)}{1} = V_T(t)\n$$\nThe response to selection in generation $t$, denoted $R(t)$, is given by applying the Breeder's Equation with this generation-specific heritability:\n$$\nR(t) = h_B^2(t) S = V_T(t) S\n$$\nWe are given that the selection differential $S$ is fixed at $S=1$. The response in generation $t$ is therefore numerically equal to the transmissible variance in that generation:\n$$\nR(t) = V_T(t)\n$$\nThe dynamics of the transmissible variance are given by the recurrence relation $V_T(t+1) = \\frac{1}{2}V_T(t)$, which reflects the loss of variance due to the averaging of parental phenotypes. The initial condition is $V_T(0) = V_A = 0.5$.\nThis is a geometric progression. We can write an explicit formula for $V_T(t)$:\n$$\nV_T(t) = V_T(0) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^t = 0.5 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^t = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^t = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t+1}\n$$\nThe response to selection in each generation is therefore:\n$$\nR(t) = V_T(t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t+1}\n$$\nThe total cumulative change in the population mean across infinitely many generations is the sum of the responses from a starting generation $t=0$ to infinity:\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{z}_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} R(t) = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t+1}\n$$\nThis is an infinite geometric series. We can write out the first few terms to identify its parameters:\n$$\n\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t+1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 + \\dots\n$$\nThe first term is $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the common ratio is $r = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $|r| < 1$, the series converges. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula $S_{\\infty} = \\frac{a}{1-r}$.\nSubstituting the values of $a$ and $r$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{z}_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1\n$$\nThe total cumulative change in the population mean under the blending inheritance model, across infinitely many generations, is exactly $1$. This result highlights a key flaw in the blending model: the heritable variation is rapidly depleted, causing the response to selection to cease quickly, in stark contrast to the sustained response possible under particulate inheritance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2694896"}]}
