This is defined as the frequency after selection, $p'$, minus the frequency before selection, $p$.\n$$\n\\Delta p = p' - p\n$$\nWe begin with a diploid population in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) before selection. The frequencies of alleles $A$ and $a$ are $p$ and $q$ respectively, with $p+q=1$. The genotype frequencies are:\n- Frequency of $AA$: $p^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$: $2pq$\n- Frequency of $aa$: $q^2$\n\nViability selection acts on these genotypes. The relative fitnesses are given as $w_{AA} = 1+s$, $w_{Aa} = 1+hs$, and $w_{aa}=1$. After selection, the frequency of each genotype is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness.\n- Proportional frequency of $AA$ after selection: $p^{2} w_{AA} = p^{2}(1+s)$\n- Proportional frequency of $Aa$ after selection: $2pq w_{Aa} = 2pq(1+hs)$\n- Proportional frequency of $aa$ after selection: $q^{2} w_{aa} = q^{2}(1) = q^{2}$\n\nThe sum of these proportional frequencies gives the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$.

A more elegant and robust method is to recognize that $\\Delta p = p' - p = \\frac{p w_A}{\\bar{w}} - p$, where $w_A$ is the average fitness of allele $A$, given by $w_A = p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa}$.\nThen, $\\Delta p = \\frac{p w_A - p \\bar{w}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p(w_A - \\bar{w})}{\\bar{w}}$.\nWe know $\\bar{w} = p w_A + q w_a$, where $w_a = p w_{Aa} + q w_{aa}$ is the average fitness of allele $a$.\nSubstituting $\\bar{w}$ into the expression for $\\Delta p$:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p(w_A - (p w_A + q w_a))}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p(w_A(1-p) - q w_a)}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nSince $1-p = q$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p(q w_A - q w_a)}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{pq(w_A - w_a)}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nThis general form is simpler to work with.

Thus, we must substitute $q = 1-p$ into the numerator and denominator.\n\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = p(1-p)s[p(1-h) + (1-p)h]\n$$\nThe denominator, $\\bar{w}$, becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = p^{2}(1+s) + 2p(1-p)(1+hs) + (1-p)^{2}\n$$\nLet's expand and simplify the denominator:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = (p^{2} + p^{2}s) + (2p-2p^{2})(1+hs) + (1-2p+p^{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{w} = p^{2} + p^{2}s + (2p + 2phs - 2p^{2} - 2p^{2}hs) + 1 - 2p + p^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{w} = (p^{2} - 2p^{2} + p^{2}) + (2p-2p) + 1 + p^{2}s + 2phs - 2p^{2}hs\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{w} = 1 + p^{2}s + 2phs - 2p^{2}hs = 1 + s(p^{2} + 2ph - 2p^{2}h)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = 1 + s[p^{2} + 2ph(1-p)]\n$$\nAnother valid form for the denominator, by direct substitution into its original definition, is simply $p^2(1+s) + 2p(1-p)(1+hs) + (1-p)^2$. However, the problem also specified eliminating $\\bar{w}$ by expressing it in terms of $p,s,h$. The form $1 + p^2s + 2p(1-p)hs$ is a direct substitution and clear representation of $\\bar{w}$.\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the final expression for $\\Delta p$:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p(1-p)s[p(1-h) + (1-p)h]}{1 + p^2s + 2p(1-p)hs}\n$$\nThis is the complete, simplified, closed-form expression for the one-generation change in allele frequency under the specified model of selection, containing only the variables $p$, $s$, and $h$ as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{p(1-p)s[p(1-h) + (1-p)h]}{1 + p^{2}s + 2p(1-p)hs}}\n$$", "id": "2758553"}, {"introduction": "The evolution of complex, polygenic traits like size and shape was a central puzzle solved by the Modern Synthesis.
