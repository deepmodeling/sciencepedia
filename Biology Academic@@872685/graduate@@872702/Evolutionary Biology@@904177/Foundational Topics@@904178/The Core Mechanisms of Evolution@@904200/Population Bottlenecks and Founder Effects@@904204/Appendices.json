The assumptions are standard for an idealized model and do not introduce contradictions. The problem is not trivial, as it requires the correct application of probability theory to the principles of population genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem asks for the probability that allele $A$ is absent in a founding population of $k$ diploid individuals. This is equivalent to the event that all $2k$ gene copies at this locus are of the allele $a$.\n\nLet $p_0$ be the frequency of allele $A$ in the large, panmictic source population. We are given $p_0 = 0.1$.\nLet $q_0$ be the frequency of allele $a$. Since the locus is bi-allelic, the sum of allele frequencies must be $1$.\n$$q_0 = 1 - p_0 = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$$\nThe source population is stated to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Under HWE, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p_0 + q_0)^2$:\n- Frequency of genotype $AA$: $P(AA) = p_0^2$\n- Frequency of genotype $Aa$: $P(Aa) = 2p_0q_0$\n- Frequency of genotype $aa$: $P(aa) = q_0^2$\n\nThe condition that allele $A$ is absent from the founder population means that every single one of the $k$ founding individuals must not possess the allele $A$. The only genotype that does not contain allele $A$ is the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$. Therefore, for allele $A$ to be completely absent from the new population, all $k$ founding individuals must have the genotype $aa$.\n\nThe probability that a single individual randomly sampled from the source population has the genotype $aa$ is equal to the frequency of that genotype in the source population, which is $P(aa) = q_0^2$.\nNumerically, this is $P(aa) = (0.9)^2 = 0.81$.\n\nThe problem states that the $k$ individuals are \"sampled at random\" and \"independently\". The probability of a sequence of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. We require the event that the first founder is $aa$, AND the second founder is $aa$, and so on, up to the $k$-th founder being $aa$.\n\nLet $P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent})$ be the probability we seek. This is the probability that all $k$ individuals are of genotype $aa$.\n$$P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent}) = \\underbrace{P(aa) \\times P(aa) \\times \\cdots \\times P(aa)}_{k \\text{ times}}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent}) = [P(aa)]^k$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(aa)$ from HWE:\n$$P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent}) = (q_0^2)^k = q_0^{2k}$$\nFinally, we substitute the given value for the allele frequency. We have $q_0 = 1 - p_0 = 0.9$.\n$$P(\\text{Allele } A \\text{ is absent}) = (0.9)^{2k}$$\n\nThis expression represents the exact probability, as a function of the number of founders $k$, that the allele $A$ is lost during the initial sampling event that founds the new population. This phenomenon is a component of the founder effect, where a loss of genetic variation occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population.\n\nAn alternative, equivalent derivation considers the sampling of alleles directly. The $k$ diploid individuals represent a total of $2k$ gene copies. Since the source population is very large, drawing these $2k$ alleles can be considered as $2k$ independent trials. The probability of drawing an allele $a$ in a single trial is $q_0 = 0.9$. The probability that all $2k$ draws result in allele $a$ is the product of the probabilities of each independent draw:\n$$P(\\text{all } 2k \\text{ alleles are } a) = (q_0)^{2k} = (0.9)^{2k}$$\nBoth derivations yield the same correct result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(0.9)^{2k}}\n$$", "id": "2745017"}, {"introduction": "While a bottleneck event causes an immediate drop in genetic diversity, its long-term consequences are shaped by the interplay of ongoing genetic drift and new mutations.

The derivation must start from the first principles of identity by descent (IBD) under the Wright-Fisher model with mutation.\n\nLet $N_e$ be the effective population size and $\\mu$ be the per-gene, per-generation mutation rate under the infinite-alleles model. We are interested in the probability $F_t$ that two gene copies sampled at random from the population in generation $t$ are identical by descent (IBD). The heterozygosity is given by $H_t = 1 - F_t$.\n\nWe first establish the recursion relation for $F_t$. For two gene copies at generation $t$ to be IBD, they must satisfy two conditions:\n1. They must have descended from ancestral gene copies at generation $t-1$ that were themselves IBD.\n2. No mutation must have occurred in either of the two gene lineages during the single generation from $t-1$ to $t$.\n\nLet us analyze the first condition. We sample two gene copies from the diploid population of effective size $N_e$, which contains $2N_e$ gene copies in total.\n- The probability that the two sampled copies descend from the *same* ancestral gene copy in generation $t-1$ is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, the ancestral copies are necessarily IBD.\n- The probability that the two sampled copies descend from *different* ancestral gene copies in generation $t-1$ is $1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, for the ancestral copies to be IBD, they must have been a random pair of IBD genes from generation $t-1$. The probability of this is $F_{t-1}$.\nCombining these two cases, the probability that the ancestral gene copies at generation $t-1$ are IBD is:\n$$ P(\\text{Ancestors are IBD}) = \\frac{1}{2N_e} \\cdot 1 + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) F_{t-1} $$\n\nNow, let us consider the second condition. Under the infinite-alleles model, any mutation creates a new, unique allele. Therefore, for the two gene copies at generation $t$ to be IBD, no mutation can have occurred along either lineage from generation $t-1$. The probability that a single gene lineage does not mutate is $(1-\\mu)$. The probability that neither of the two lineages mutates is $(1-\\mu)^2$, assuming independence.\n\nCombining both conditions, the recursion for $F_t$ is the product of the probability that the ancestors were IBD and the probability that no mutation occurred:\n$$ F_t = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) F_{t-1} \\right] (1 - \\mu)^2 $$\n\nThe problem specifies that we should keep terms to first order in $\\mu$. Given that $\\mu$ is small ($\\mu \\ll 1$), we can expand $(1-\\mu)^2$:\n$$ (1-\\mu)^2 = 1 - 2\\mu + \\mu^2 $$\nNeglecting the term of order $\\mu^2$, we obtain the approximation $(1-\\mu)^2 \\approx 1 - 2\\mu$.

The problem specifies using the cumulative drift hazard, which is proportional to the sum of the inverse population sizes. For the effective population size $N_e$ to be identical between Scenario A and Scenario B, their cumulative drift hazards over the $T=20$ generations must be equal.\n\nThe per-generation drift hazard is proportional to $\\frac{1}{2N_t}$. The cumulative hazard over $T$ generations is $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{2N_t}$. We equate this quantity for both scenarios:\n$$\n\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{2 N_t^{(\\mathrm{A})}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{2 N_t^{(\\mathrm{B})}}\n$$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ can be cancelled. The population size is infinite outside the bottleneck, meaning $\\frac{1}{N_t} = 0$ for those generations. The sum is non-zero only during the bottleneck periods.\n\nFor Scenario A, the bottleneck lasts for $t_b^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 2$ generations with size $N_b^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 50$. The sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{N_t^{(\\mathrm{A})}} = \\frac{t_b^{(\\mathrm{A})}}{N_b^{(\\mathrm{A})}} = \\frac{2}{50}\n$$\nFor Scenario B, the bottleneck lasts for $t_b^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 5$ generations with an unknown size $N_b^{(\\mathrm{B})}$. The sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{N_t^{(\\mathrm{B})}} = \\frac{t_b^{(\\mathrm{B})}}{N_b^{(\\mathrm{B})}} = \\frac{5}{N_b^{(\\mathrm{B})}}\n$$\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{5}{N_b^{(\\mathrm{B})}}\n$$\nSolving for $N_b^{(\\mathrm{B})}$:\n$$\nN_b^{(\\mathrm{B})} = \\frac{5 \\times 50}{2} = \\frac{250}{2} = 125\n$$\nThus, the bottleneck population size in Scenario B must be $125$.\n\n**Part 2: Expected Heterozygosity.**\n\nExpected heterozygosity at generation $t$ is $H_t = 1 - \\sum_{i} p_i(t)^2$, where $p_i(t)$ is the frequency of allele $i$. The term $J_t = \\sum_{i} p_i(t)^2$ is the expected homozygosity. We first derive the one-generation recurrence for $H_t$.\n\nUnder the neutral Wright–Fisher model, the $2N_{t+1}$ gene copies in generation $t+1$ are sampled with replacement from the gene pool of generation $t$. Let the census size of generation $t$ be $N_t$. The new allele frequencies $p_i(t+1)$ are random variables. We seek the expectation of $J_{t+1} = \\sum_{i} p_i(t+1)^2$ conditional on the frequencies $p_i(t)$ at generation $t$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[J_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i} p_i(t+1)^2\\right] = \\sum_{i} \\mathbb{E}[p_i(t+1)^2]\n$$\nThe number of copies of allele $i$ in generation $t+1$, let us call it $k_i$, follows a binomial distribution $k_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(2N_{t+1}, p_i(t))$. For this derivation, we can denote the population size simply as $N$, so $k_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(2N, p_i(t))$. The frequency is $p_i(t+1) = k_i/(2N)$.\nThe expectation of the squared frequency is related to the variance: $\\mathbb{E}[p_i(t+1)^2] = \\text{Var}(p_i(t+1)) + (\\mathbb{E}[p_i(t+1)])^2$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[k_i] = 2N p_i(t)$, so $\\mathbb{E}[p_i(t+1)] = p_i(t)$.\n$\\text{Var}(k_i) = 2N p_i(t)(1-p_i(t))$, so $\\text{Var}(p_i(t+1)) = \\frac{1}{(2N)^2} \\text{Var}(k_i) = \\frac{p_i(t)(1-p_i(t))}{2N}$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[p_i(t+1)^2] = \\frac{p_i(t)(1-p_i(t))}{2N} + p_i(t)^2\n$$\nSumming over all alleles $i$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[J_{t+1}] = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{p_i(t)}{2N} - \\frac{p_i(t)^2}{2N} + p_i(t)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2N}\\sum_i p_i(t) + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2N}\\right)\\sum_i p_i(t)^2\n$$\nSince $\\sum_i p_i(t) = 1$ and $J_t = \\sum_i p_i(t)^2$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[J_{t+1}] = \\frac{1}{2N} + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2N}\\right)J_t\n$$\nThe expected heterozygosity evolves as $\\mathbb{E}[H_{t+1}] = 1 - \\mathbb{E}[J_{t+1}]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[H_{t+1}] = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2N} + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2N}\\right)(1-H_t) \\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2N} - 1 + H_t + \\frac{1}{2N} - \\frac{H_t}{2N} = H_t\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required recursion.

Here, A has total decay $\\approx 2/100 = 0.02$ and B has $\\approx 5/250=0.02$. The ratio is indeed very close to $1$.\n\n**Part 3: Expected Number of Captured Alleles.**\n\nAt the onset of the bottleneck, a new generation of $N_b$ diploid individuals is formed by sampling $n = 2N_b$ gene copies from the infinite ancestral population. Let $K$ be the number of distinct alleles in this sample. We are asked to derive its expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[K]$.\n\nLet the initial frequencies of the $M=51$ alleles be $\\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_M\\}$. Let $K_j$ be an indicator random variable such that $K_j=1$ if allele $j$ is present in the sample of $n$ gene copies, and $K_j=0$ otherwise.\nThe total number of captured alleles is $K = \\sum_{j=1}^{M} K_j$.\nBy the linearity of expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[K] = \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\mathbb{E}[K_j]$.\n\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates: $\\mathbb{E}[K_j] = P(K_j=1)$. This is the probability that at least one copy of allele $j$ is found in the sample. It is easier to calculate the complementary probability: that allele $j$ is *not* found in the sample.\nThe probability of selecting allele $j$ in a single draw is $p_j$. The probability of *not* selecting allele $j$ is $(1-p_j)$.\nSince the $n$ gene copies are sampled independently from an infinite population, the probability that none of them are of type $j$ is $(1-p_j)^n$.\nTherefore, the probability that allele $j$ is captured is:\n$$\nP(K_j=1) = 1 - (1-p_j)^n\n$$\nThe expected total number of distinct alleles is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[K] = \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\left(1 - (1-p_j)^n\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required first-principles derivation. Now we apply it to the two scenarios.\nThe initial frequencies are $p_1=0.5$ and $p_j=0.01$ for $j=2, \\ldots, 51$.\n\nFor Scenario A: $N_b^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 50$, so the sample size is $n^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 2 \\times 50 = 100$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[K]^{(\\mathrm{A})} = \\left(1 - (1-0.5)^{100}\\right) + \\sum_{j=2}^{51} \\left(1 - (1-0.01)^{100}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[K]^{(\\mathrm{A})} = \\left(1 - 0.5^{100}\\right) + 50 \\left(1 - 0.99^{100}\\right)\n$$\nFor Scenario B: $N_b^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 125$, so the sample size is $n^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 2 \\times 125 = 250$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[K]^{(\\mathrm{B})} = \\left(1 - (1-0.5)^{250}\\right) + \\sum_{j=2}^{51} \\left(1 - (1-0.01)^{250}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[K]^{(\\mathrm{B})} = \\left(1 - 0.5^{250}\\right) + 50 \\left(1 - 0.99^{250}\\right)\n$$\nWe need to compute $\\Delta K = \\mathbb{E}[K]^{(\\mathrm{B})} - \\mathbb{E}[K]^{(\\mathrm{A})}$.\n$$\n\\Delta K = \\left[ (1 - 0.5^{250}) + 50(1 - 0.99^{250}) \\right] - \\left[ (1 - 0.5^{100}) + 50(1 - 0.99^{100}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta K = (0.5^{100} - 0.5^{250}) + 50 \\left( (1 - 0.99^{250}) - (1 - 0.99^{100}) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta K = (0.5^{100} - 0.5^{250}) + 50 \\left( 0.99^{100} - 0.99^{250} \\right)\n$$\nThe terms $0.5^{100} \\approx 7.89 \\times 10^{-31}$ and $0.5^{250}$ are negligibly small and their difference does not affect the result to the required precision. We can approximate $\\Delta K$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta K \\approx 50 \\left( 0.99^{100} - 0.99^{250} \\right)\n$$\nUsing a calculator for precision:\n$0.99^{100} \\approx 0.366032341273229$\n$0.99^{250} \\approx 0.081055181987534$\n$$\n\\Delta K \\approx 50 \\left( 0.36603234 - 0.08105518 \\right) = 50 \\left( 0.28497716 \\right) = 14.248858\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta K = 14.25$. This result highlights a key difference between short, severe bottlenecks and long, mild ones. Even when they have the same effective population size concerning heterozygosity decay, the larger census size of the milder bottleneck ($n^{(\\mathrm{B})} = 250$ versus $n^{(\\mathrm{A})} = 100$) allows for the capture of significantly more of the initial rare alleles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.25}$$", "id": "2745004"}]}
