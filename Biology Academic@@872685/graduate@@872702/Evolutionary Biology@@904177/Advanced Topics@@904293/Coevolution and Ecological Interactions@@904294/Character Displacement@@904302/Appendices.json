This exercise provides practice in interpreting the results of such an experiment to quantify the genetic basis of a character displacement pattern [@problem_id:1913107].", "problem": "An evolutionary ecologist is studying two closely related species of flowering plants, *Silene rivalis* and *Silene competitora*. In regions where the species grow in isolation (allopatry), both species achieve a similar average height. However, in regions where their populations overlap (sympatry), they are engaged in intense competition for sunlight. Field observations have revealed a pattern consistent with character displacement: in sympatric zones, *S. rivalis* populations are on average taller, and *S. competitora* populations are on average shorter, compared to their respective allopatric populations.\n\nTo determine if this observed divergence is a result of evolved genetic differences (i.e., genetically canalized character displacement) or an immediate flexible response to the presence of a competitor (i.e., phenotypic plasticity), the ecologist conducted a common garden experiment. Seeds were collected from four distinct source populations: allopatric *S. rivalis*, sympatric *S. rivalis*, allopatric *S. competitora*, and sympatric *S. competitora*. These seeds were then grown in a controlled greenhouse environment under identical conditions of soil, water, and light. Crucially, each plant was grown individually in its own pot, removing the environmental cue of interspecific competition.\n\nThe average plant height at maturity was measured for both the wild populations and the plants grown in the common garden. The results are summarized below:\n\n**Field Survey Data (Wild Populations):**\n- Average height of allopatric *S. rivalis*: $50.0$ cm\n- Average height of sympatric *S. rivalis*: $75.0$ cm\n- Average height of allopatric *S. competitora*: $55.0$ cm\n- Average height of sympatric *S. competitora*: $35.0$ cm\n\n**Common Garden Experiment Data (Plants grown in isolation):**\n- Average height of plants from allopatric *S. rivalis* seeds: $52.0$ cm\n- Average height of plants from sympatric *S. rivalis* seeds: $68.5$ cm\n- Average height of plants from allopatric *S. competitora* seeds: $56.0$ cm\n- Average height of plants from sympatric *S. competitora* seeds: $45.5$ cm\n\nBased on these data, calculate the proportion of the total character displacement observed in the height of *Silene rivalis* that is attributable to heritable genetic differences. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We are asked for the proportion of the total character displacement in height for Silene rivalis that is attributable to heritable genetic differences.

To establish a causal link between interspecific competition and evolutionary change, ecologists must design field experiments that manipulate competitor presence and quantify selection in real time.

A closely related competitor species overlaps in diet but differs in preferred seed sizes. You want to test whether the presence of the competitor immediately alters natural selection on bill depth associated with resource use, in a way consistent with character displacement. Your goal is to isolate changes in selection within a single breeding season that are causally attributable to competitor presence or absence, rather than to total consumer density, site differences, or transgenerational responses. You can use marked individuals, field enclosures, and standard demographic and dietary measurements.

Total consumer density (i.e., distinguish the effect of competitor *identity* from the effect of increased *numbers* of consumers).\n    2.  Site-specific differences.\n    3.  Transgenerational responses (e.g., evolution, maternal effects).\n-   **Available Tools**: Marked individuals, field enclosures, and standard demographic and dietary measurement techniques.\n-   **Required Output**: The an experimental design and the key analytical contrast that provides an unbiased estimate of the specified causal effect.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is anchored in the well-established ecological and evolutionary theory of character displacement. The premise—that interspecific competition for resources can be a potent selective force on a morphological trait like bill depth—is a classic concept in evolutionary biology, exemplified by Darwin's finches. The proposed methods are standard in field ecology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The objective is clearly and precisely defined: to design an experiment that isolates a specific causal effect (competitor presence on a selection gradient) while controlling for a specified list of confounding variables. The problem is structured to have a single best answer among the choices, based on the principles of experimental design.\n-   **Objective**: The language used is formal, technical, and free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or non-scientific claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It presents a rigorous question in experimental evolutionary ecology. Therefore, I will proceed to derive a solution by evaluating the provided options.\n\n### Analysis of a Valid Problem\n\nThe objective is to measure the directional selection gradient, $\\beta$, on bill depth ($z$) and to determine if this gradient is altered by the presence of a competitor. The selection gradient is the partial regression coefficient of relative fitness ($w$) on the standardized trait, $w \\sim \\beta z$. Our goal is to estimate $\\Delta\\beta = \\beta_{\\text{competitor present}} - \\beta_{\\text{competitor absent}}$ and test if $\\Delta\\beta \\neq 0$, while ensuring this estimate is not biased by confounders.\n\n**Option A: Establish enclosures with the competitor added to treatment enclosures while leaving control enclosures unmanipulated. Do not alter conspecific density. At the end of the breeding season, measure bill depth of offspring born in each enclosure and compare mean offspring bill depth between treatments. Infer selection from differences in offspring means and conclude competitor-induced selection if means differ.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed for two primary reasons.\n1.  **Measurement of Response, Not Selection**: This design measures the mean trait value of the F1 generation ($\\bar{z}_{\\text{offspring}}$). A change in the mean trait value across one generation is the *response to selection* ($R$), not selection itself ($S$). According to the breeder's equation, $R = h^2S$, where $h^2$ is the narrow-sense heritability of the trait. This design confounds the selective pressure ($S$) with the genetic architecture of the trait ($h^2$). The problem explicitly asks to isolate the change in *selection*, not the evolutionary response.\n2.  **Confounding of Treatment and Density**: The design adds competitors to the treatment enclosures but leaves control enclosures \"unmanipulated.\" This means the total density of consumers (focal individuals + competitors) is higher in the treatment enclosures than in the controls (focal individuals only). Any observed difference in offspring traits could be a result of increased overall density and resource depletion, rather than the specific competitive effect of the heterospecific rival. This fails to control for the \"total consumer density\" confounder, as explicitly required.\n\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**Option B: In free-ranging populations with no experimental manipulation, identify sites where the competitor naturally colonizes during the study. At these sites and at matched sites without colonization, mark focal adults and record bill depth at the start of the season. Track adult survival and number of fledglings. Regress fitness components on bill depth separately in colonized and uncolonized sites and attribute any differences to competitor effects.**\n\nThis option describes an observational \"natural experiment.\" While it correctly identifies the need to measure fitness components on marked adults to estimate selection, it has a critical flaw.\n1.  **Failure to Establish Causality**: This is not a randomized experiment. The process of \"natural colonization\" is non-random. Sites that are colonized may differ systematically from uncolonized sites in ways that also affect selection on the focal species (e.g., resource abundance, vegetation structure, predator communities). \"Matching\" sites is an attempt to control for this, but it is notoriously difficult and can never account for unmeasured confounding variables. Therefore, any observed difference in selection between site types cannot be causally attributed to the competitor's presence with high confidence. The problem requires a design that \"most directly estimates the causal effect... while minimizing confounding.\" A randomized experiment is superior for this purpose. The availability of \"field enclosures\" in the problem setup implies that an experimental approach is feasible and thus preferred over a purely observational one.\n\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**Option C: Use randomized, replicated field enclosures assigned to a competitor presence treatment and a competitor absence treatment. To hold total consumer density constant, where the competitor is absent, add conspecifics to replace competitor biomass so that total granivore biomass is matched across treatments. Before selection acts, capture and uniquely mark all focal individuals, measure bill depth, and assess resource distribution. Monitor within-season viability and reproductive success to estimate individual relative fitness and post-selection trait means of survivors. Estimate the standardized directional selection gradient on bill depth separately for each enclosure. Test whether the competitor effect is nonzero by comparing the trait-by-treatment interaction in a model of relative fitness that includes enclosure as a random effect, thereby quantifying the difference in directional selection gradients between treatments. Optionally, swap treatments across the same enclosures in a subsequent season to control for persistent site effects and re-estimate the contrast.**\n\nThis option describes a robust and properly controlled experiment that meets all requirements.\n1.  **Experimental Control**: The design uses randomized, replicated enclosures, which is the gold standard for establishing causality and controlling for unknown site-specific factors.\n2.  **Control of Confounders**: It explicitly and correctly controls for total consumer density by using conspecifics as \"replacement\" in the control group to equalize total granivore biomass. This isolates the effect of the competitor's *identity* and niche from the simple effect of consumer *density*.\n3.  **Correct Measurement of Selection**: It focuses on measuring fitness components (viability, reproductive success) on marked individuals *within a single season* to calculate individual relative fitness, ($w_i$). This directly estimates selection on the parental generation, avoiding the confounding issue of heritability mentioned in Option A.\n4.  **Correct Analytical Approach**: It proposes estimating the directional selection gradient ($\\beta$) and formally testing for a difference between treatments via a trait-by-treatment interaction term. In a linear model, this would be $w \\sim \\beta_1 z + \\beta_2 T + \\beta_3 (z \\cdot T)$, where $z$ is the trait and $T$ is a dummy variable for treatment. The coefficient $\\beta_3$ directly estimates the change in the selection gradient caused by the treatment and testing if $\\beta_3 \\ne 0$ is the correct test of the hypothesis. This is the \"key analytical contrast.\" The inclusion of \"enclosure as a random effect\" is a sophisticated and correct way to account for non-independence of individuals within the same enclosure.\n5.  **Rigor**: The optional step of swapping treatments further strengthens the design against persistent, unknown site effects.\n\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**Option D: In laboratory aviaries, house mixed-species groups of the focal bird and the competitor under controlled food supply consisting of a single seed size class. Measure each focal bird’s bill depth and the rate of seed intake over short trials. Correlate intake rate with bill depth and, if the correlation differs between mixed-species and single-species aviaries, infer competitor-induced selection on bill depth. Do not track survival or reproduction.**\n\nThis option is critically flawed.\n1.  **Measures Performance, Not Fitness**: Intake rate is a component of performance, not total fitness. A bird may have a high intake rate in a short trial but suffer from higher predation, stress, or poor nutrient conversion, leading to lower survival or reproductive success (i.e., lower fitness). Selection acts on fitness, not on any single performance metric in isolation. The problem requires estimating selection, which necessitates measuring fitness. This design \"do[es] not track survival or reproduction.\"\n2.  **Artificial Environment**: The experiment is conducted in a laboratory aviary, not the field. More importantly, it uses \"a single seed size class.\" Character displacement is driven by competition across a *range* of resource types (e.g., a spectrum of seed sizes), which allows differential specialization to reduce competition. By providing only one seed size, the experiment removes the ecological axis for niche partitioning, making the results difficult to interpret in the context of the character displacement hypothesis. The selection pressure is entirely artificial and may not reflect what happens in nature.\n\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2696736"}, {"introduction": "A mechanistic understanding of character displacement requires a predictive, quantitative framework that can forecast the rate and direction of evolutionary change.

This is the essence of character displacement.\n\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values:\n- $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B} = \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B}\\|^{2} = 2^2 + 1^2 = 5$\n- $c = 0.2$, $\\sigma^{2} = 2$\n\nWe calculate the scalar coefficient of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\frac{c}{\\sigma^{2}}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B}\\|^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{0.2}{2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{5}{2 \\cdot 2}\\right) = 0.1 \\exp(-1.25)\n$$\nUsing a calculator, $\\exp(-1.25) \\approx 0.2865048$.\nThe scalar coefficient is $0.1 \\times 0.2865048 = 0.02865048$.\nNow, we calculate the selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = 0.02865048 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0.05730096 \\\\ 0.02865048\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the evolutionary response $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} = \\mathbf{G}_{A} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix}0.5  0.1\\\\0.1  0.2\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0.05730096 \\\\ 0.02865048\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0.5)(0.05730096) + (0.1)(0.02865048) \\\\ (0.1)(0.05730096) + (0.2)(0.02865048) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.02865048 + 0.002865048 \\\\ 0.005730096 + 0.005730096 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.031515528 \\\\ 0.011460192 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nRounding to the precision given in the options, we obtain $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix}0.0315155\\\\0.0114602\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The one-generation change in the focal mean trait is $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}}=\\mathbf{G}_{A}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, where $\\mathbf{G}_{A}$ is the additive genetic variance–covariance matrix of species A, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{z}}\\big[\\ln \\bar{w}_{A}(\\boldsymbol{z})\\big]\\big|_{\\boldsymbol{z}=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}}$ is the directional selection gradient on species A caused by interspecific competition, computed here by replacing $\\ln \\bar{w}_{A}$ with the Malthusian fitness $m_{A}$ under weak selection. With the given $m_{A}(\\boldsymbol{z})$, this yields $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\dfrac{c}{\\sigma^{2}}\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\dfrac{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B}\\|^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\Big)\\,(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B})$, and thus $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} =\\begin{pmatrix}0.0315155\\\\0.0114602\\end{pmatrix}$, so selection displaces species A away from species B along each trait axis.**\n- **Theory**: The use of $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}}=\\mathbf{G}_{A}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, the definition of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, and its approximation via $m_A$ are all correct.\n- **Calculation**: The derived formula for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is correct. My numerical calculation confirms the final vector $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}}$.\n- **Interpretation**: The response vector has positive components, indicating movement away from species B at the origin. This is correctly described as displacement.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. The one-generation change in the focal mean trait is $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}}=\\mathbf{P}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, where $\\mathbf{P}$ is the phenotypic variance–covariance matrix of species A and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=-\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{z}}\\bar{w}_{A}(\\boldsymbol{z})\\big|_{\\boldsymbol{z}=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}}$ is the negative gradient of absolute fitness due to interspecific competition. With the given values, this implies $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} =\\begin{pmatrix}-0.0315155\\\\-0.0114602\\end{pmatrix}$, indicating movement toward the competitor to reduce overlap.**\n- **Theory**: This option is fundamentally flawed. The evolutionary response depends on the *additive genetic* variance ($\\mathbf{G}_A$), not the *phenotypic* variance ($\\mathbf{P}$). Furthermore, the selection gradient points in the direction of increasing fitness, not its negative. Movement towards the competitor would increase competition and lower fitness, which is contrary to the principle of natural selection.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. The one-generation change in the focal mean trait is $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}}=\\mathbf{G}_{A}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, with $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{z}} m_{A}(\\boldsymbol{z})\\big|_{\\boldsymbol{z}=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}}=c\\,\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\dfrac{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B}\\|^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\Big)\\,(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B})$ (omitting the factor $\\sigma^{-2}$ as unnecessary under weak selection). This yields $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}} =\\begin{pmatrix}0.0630311\\\\0.0229204\\end{pmatrix}$.**\n- **Theory**: The formula for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is incorrect. The factor of $1/\\sigma^2$ arises from the differentiation of the Gaussian function and is not optional. The justification for its omission (\"unnecessary under weak selection\") is baseless and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the calculus involved. The calculation performed seems to correctly follow from this flawed premise, as the resulting vector is exactly $\\sigma^2=2$ times larger than the correct one.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. The one-generation change in the focal mean trait is $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{z}}=\\big(\\mathbf{G}_{A}+\\mathbf{G}_{B}\\big)\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, where $\\mathbf{G}_{B}$ is the additive genetic variance–covariance matrix of species B because both species’ genetic variances modulate the response to interspecific competition, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B}} m_{A}(\\boldsymbol{z})\\big|_{\\boldsymbol{z}=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}}$ is the gradient with respect to the competitor’s mean trait. For the given numbers, this implies a response proportional to $-(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{A}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{B})$ and thus movement toward the competitor in trait space.**\n- **Theory**: This option contains multiple fundamental errors. The response of species A depends only on its own genetic variance, $\\mathbf{G}_A$. The matrix $\\mathbf{G}_B$ is irrelevant for the response of species A. The selection gradient $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is defined with respect to the traits of individuals in the focal population ($\\boldsymbol{z}$), not with respect to the mean trait of the competitor ($\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_B$). This redefinition is incorrect.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2696701"}]}
