This foundational exercise asks you to analyze the invasion of a virulent parasite into an avirulent population within a gene-for-gene (GFG) framework.

Hosts carry either a resistance allele $R$ or a susceptibility allele $r$ at a single locus. Parasites carry either an avirulence allele $A$ or a virulence allele $V$ at a single locus. The GFG compatibility rule is as follows: an avirulent parasite $A$ can infect only $r$ hosts, whereas a virulent parasite $V$ can infect both $R$ and $r$ hosts. Assume a large, well-mixed population so that genetic drift can be neglected, and suppose host genotype frequencies remain effectively constant over the single generation considered for invasion analysis.\n\nLet the frequency of the resistance allele $R$ in the host population be $p \\in [0,1]$ (so the frequency of $r$ is $1-p$). Let successful infection of a compatible host yield an expected number $b$ of transmissible propagules for a parasite lacking any cost. Assume that the virulence allele $V$ carries a multiplicative cost $c_V \\in [0,1)$ that reduces its expected propagule production on any compatible host by a factor of $(1-c_V)$, while the avirulent allele $A$ bears no cost. There are no additional costs to host resistance relevant over the single generation considered, and co-infections and density feedbacks can be neglected at invasion.\n\nA rare $V$ mutant arises in a resident parasite population fixed for $A$.

All assumptions—haploidy, fitness costs, invasion analysis—are standard in theoretical population genetics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($p$, $b$, $c_V$), a clear genetic interaction rule, and a precise criterion for invasion. The objective is to find a specific threshold, which is a well-defined mathematical task.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is technical and precise, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All variables are defined, and the constraints are consistent. The assumption of constant host frequencies is a standard method for invasion analysis, simplifying the problem to a single generation.\n5.  **Realism**: The model is an abstraction, as all models are, but it is not scientifically implausible. It captures the essential trade-off between virulence (broader host range) and its associated cost, a common theme in evolutionary epidemiology.\n6.  **Triviality**: The problem is a straightforward application of first principles, but it is not trivial. It requires correct formulation of fitness functions and algebraic manipulation to arrive at the correct ecological-evolutionary conclusion.\n\nThe validation is complete. The problem is deemed valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is based on the principle of invasion fitness. A rare mutant allele will increase in frequency if its expected reproductive success, or fitness ($W$), is greater than the average fitness of the resident population. Here, the resident population is fixed for the avirulence allele $A$, so we compare the fitness of the mutant $V$ ($W_V$) to the fitness of the resident $A$ ($W_A$). The mutant invades if $W_V > W_A$.\n\nLet us first determine the fitness of the resident parasite allele, $A$. The fitness is its expected number of offspring propagules in one generation. This is calculated by summing the reproductive success across all possible host encounters, weighted by the frequency of those hosts.\n\nThe resident parasite $A$ can only infect hosts with the susceptibility allele $r$. The frequency of such hosts is $1-p$. The reproductive success from this interaction is $b$, as the $A$ allele carries no cost. The parasite $A$ cannot infect hosts with the resistance allele $R$, whose frequency is $p$. The reproductive success from this encounter is $0$.\n\nThus, the expected fitness of the resident allele $A$ is:\n$$W_A = (\\text{frequency of } r \\text{ hosts}) \\times (\\text{payoff from } r) + (\\text{frequency of } R \\text{ hosts}) \\times (\\text{payoff from } R)$$\n$$W_A = (1-p) \\cdot b + p \\cdot 0$$\n$$W_A = b(1-p)$$\n\nNext, we determine the fitness of the rare invading mutant allele, $V$. According to the GFG rule, the virulent parasite $V$ can infect both $r$ hosts and $R$ hosts. However, the $V$ allele carries a multiplicative fitness cost $c_V$, so its reproductive success on any compatible host is reduced to $b(1-c_V)$.\n\nThe expected fitness of the mutant allele $V$ is:\n$$W_V = (\\text{frequency of } r \\text{ hosts}) \\times (\\text{payoff from } r) + (\\text{frequency of } R \\text{ hosts}) \\times (\\text{payoff from } R)$$\n$$W_V = (1-p) \\cdot b(1-c_V) + p \\cdot b(1-c_V)$$\nThis expression can be factored:\n$$W_V = b(1-c_V) \\cdot ((1-p) + p)$$\n$$W_V = b(1-c_V) \\cdot 1$$\n$$W_V = b(1-c_V)$$\n\nThe condition for the invasion of the $V$ allele is $W_V > W_A$. Substituting the derived expressions for fitness:\n$$b(1-c_V) > b(1-p)$$\nThe baseline reproductive success $b$ must be positive ($b > 0$) for any parasite population to persist, so we can divide both sides of the inequality by $b$ without changing its direction:\n$$1-c_V > 1-p$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives:\n$$-c_V > -p$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$c_V < p$$\n\nThis inequality defines the condition under which the virulence allele $V$ can invade the population. The problem asks for the critical virulence cost, $c_V^{\\star}(p)$, which is the threshold value of the cost. At this threshold, the fitness of the mutant and the resident are equal ($W_V=W_A$), and selection is neutral. This is the boundary between invasion ($c_V < c_V^{\\star}(p)$) and failure to invade ($c_V > c_V^{\\star}(p)$).\n\nSetting the invasion condition to an equality gives the critical value:\n$$c_V^{\\star}(p) = p$$\n\nThis result is logically coherent. The cost of virulence ($c_V$) that can be tolerated by the parasite population is directly proportional to the benefit of being virulent. The benefit of virulence is the ability to infect resistant hosts, which are present at frequency $p$. If there are no resistant hosts ($p=0$), there is no benefit to virulence, and any cost ($c_V > 0$) will be selected against, so $c_V^{\\star}(0)=0$. If all hosts are resistant ($p=1$), avirulent parasites have zero fitness, so a virulent mutant will invade as long as its cost is not absolute ($c_V < 1$), thus $c_V^{\\star}(1)=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p}\n$$", "id": "2716871"}, {"introduction": "While invasion analysis explains how coevolutionary arms races begin, understanding their long-term behavior requires studying the system's dynamics around its equilibria.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**(a) Identification of the interior equilibrium**\n\nAn equilibrium point $(p^{\\ast}, q^{\\ast})$ of the system is a point where the rates of change of both allele frequencies are zero. For an interior equilibrium, we require $p^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$ and $q^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$.\nThe system of equations is:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = p(1-p)\\bigl(W_{H,1}(q) - W_{H,2}(q)\\bigr) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dq}{dt} = q(1-q)\\bigl(W_{P,1}(p) - W_{P,2}(p)\\bigr) = 0 $$\nSince we are seeking an interior equilibrium, $p(1-p) \\neq 0$ and $q(1-q) \\neq 0$. Therefore, the equilibrium conditions reduce to:\n$$ W_{H,1}(q^{\\ast}) - W_{H,2}(q^{\\ast}) = 0 $$\n$$ W_{P,1}(p^{\\ast}) - W_{P,2}(p^{\\ast}) = 0 $$\nWe solve these equations for $q^{\\ast}$ and $p^{\\ast}$ respectively.\n\nFor the host frequency, we have:\n$$ (1 - s_{H} q^{\\ast}) - (1 - s_{H} (1 - q^{\\ast})) = 0 $$\n$$ 1 - s_{H} q^{\\ast} - 1 + s_{H} - s_{H} q^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n$$ s_{H} - 2 s_{H} q^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n$$ s_{H}(1 - 2q^{\\ast}) = 0 $$\nSince $s_{H} \\in (0,1)$, we must have $1 - 2q^{\\ast} = 0$, which yields $q^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor the parasite frequency, we have:\n$$ (1 + s_{P} p^{\\ast}) - (1 + s_{P} (1 - p^{\\ast})) = 0 $$\n$$ 1 + s_{P} p^{\\ast} - 1 - s_{P} + s_{P} p^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n$$ 2 s_{P} p^{\\ast} - s_{P} = 0 $$\n$$ s_{P}(2p^{\\ast} - 1) = 0 $$\nSince $s_{P} \\in (0,1)$, we must have $2p^{\\ast} - 1 = 0$, which yields $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, the unique interior equilibrium is $(p^{\\ast}, q^{\\ast}) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\n**(b) Linearization and stability analysis**\n\nTo linearize the system, we first write the dynamics in terms of $p$ and $q$:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = f(p,q) = p(1-p) \\bigl(s_{H}(1-2q)\\bigr) = s_{H}(p-p^{2})(1-2q) $$\n$$ \\frac{dq}{dt} = g(p,q) = q(1-q) \\bigl(s_{P}(2p-1)\\bigr) = s_{P}(q-q^{2})(2p-1) $$\nNext, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system, where the entries are the partial derivatives of $f$ and $g$ with respect to $p$ and $q$:\n$$ J(p,q) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} = s_{H}(1-2p)(1-2q) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} = s_{H}(p-p^{2})(-2) = -2s_{H}p(1-p) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p} = s_{P}(q-q^{2})(2) = 2s_{P}q(1-q) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q} = s_{P}(1-2q)(2p-1) $$\nWe evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the interior equilibrium $(p^{\\ast}, q^{\\ast}) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$:\n$$ J(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix} s_{H}(1-2(\\frac{1}{2}))(1-2(\\frac{1}{2})) & -2s_{H}(\\frac{1}{2})(1-\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\ 2s_{P}(\\frac{1}{2})(1-\\frac{1}{2}) & s_{P}(1-2(\\frac{1}{2}))(2(\\frac{1}{2})-1) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ J(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix} s_{H}(0)(0) & -2s_{H}(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\ 2s_{P}(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) & s_{P}(0)(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{s_{H}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{s_{P}}{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo determine the stability of the equilibrium, we find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of this matrix by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & -\\frac{s_{H}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{s_{P}}{2} & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - \\left(-\\frac{s_{H}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{s_{P}}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^{2} + \\frac{s_{H}s_{P}}{4} = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^{2} = -\\frac{s_{H}s_{P}}{4} $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{-\\frac{s_{H}s_{P}}{4}} = \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{s_{H}s_{P}}}{2}$.\nSince $s_{H} > 0$ and $s_{P} > 0$, the eigenvalues are a pair of purely imaginary complex conjugates. The real part of the eigenvalues is zero. This demonstrates that, to first order in $s_{H}$ and $s_{P}$, the equilibrium is a neutrally stable center. The dynamics near the equilibrium consist of closed orbits, corresponding to oscillations.\n\n**(c) Period of small-amplitude oscillations**\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the equilibrium are of the form $\\lambda = \\alpha \\pm i\\omega$, where $\\alpha$ is the real part and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillations.

This is the minimum possible value for $k_M$.\nThe maximized likelihood for the MA class is thus:\n$$\\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{MA}}(\\epsilon) = L(I|\\epsilon) = (1-\\epsilon)^3 \\epsilon^0 = (1-\\epsilon)^3$$\n\n**Gene-for-Gene (GFG) Model**\nThe GFG model class consists of matrices $M$ for which there exist host and parasite permutations, $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$, such that the permuted matrix elements are $M'_{\\pi,\\sigma}(i, j) = \\mathbb{I}\\{i \\ge j\\}$. This is equivalent to stating that $M_{ij} = \\mathbb{I}\\{\\pi^{-1}(i) \\ge \\sigma^{-1}(j)\\}$ for some permutations $\\pi^{-1}$ and $\\sigma^{-1}$. Let us denote these inverse permutations by $p = \\pi^{-1}$ and $q = \\sigma^{-1}$. So, $M_{ij} = \\mathbb{I}\\{p(i) \\ge q(j)\\}$ for some permutations $p, q$ on $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n\nTo find $\\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{GFG}}(\\epsilon)$, we must find permutations $p$ and $q$ that define a matrix $M$ which:\n1. Satisfies the non-zero likelihood conditions: $M_{11}=1, M_{22}=1, M_{33}=1$. This is equivalent to $p(1) \\ge q(1)$, $p(2) \\ge q(2)$, and $p(3) \\ge q(3)$.\n2. Minimizes $k_M = M_{12} + M_{21} + M_{31} = \\mathbb{I}\\{p(1) \\ge q(2)\\} + \\mathbb{I}\\{p(2) \\ge q(1)\\} + \\mathbb{I}\\{p(3) \\ge q(1)\\}$.\n\nLet's determine the minimum possible value of $k_M$.\nCan $k_M=0$? This would require:\na) $p(1) < q(2)$\nb) $p(2) < q(1)$\nc) $p(3) < q(1)$\nalong with the non-zero likelihood conditions: $p(1) \\ge q(1)$, $p(2) \\ge q(2)$, $p(3) \\ge q(3)$.\n\nFrom $p(2) < q(1)$ and $p(1) \\ge q(1)$, it follows that $p(2) < p(1)$.\nFrom $p(3) < q(1)$ and $p(1) \\ge q(1)$, it follows that $p(3) < p(1)$.\nTherefore, $p(1)$ must be greater than both $p(2)$ and $p(3)$, which implies $p(1)=3$.\nNow, using the condition $p(1) < q(2)$, we get $3 < q(2)$. This is impossible, as the codomain of the permutation $q$ is $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\nThus, $k_M$ cannot be $0$. The minimum possible value for $k_M$ is at least $1$.\n\nCan $k_M=1$? This requires two of the three indicator functions to be zero. Let us test the case where $\\mathbb{I}\\{p(1) \\ge q(2)\\}=0$, $\\mathbb{I}\\{p(2) \\ge q(1)\\}=1$, and $\\mathbb{I}\\{p(3) \\ge q(1)\\}=0$. The conditions are:\n$p(1) < q(2)$, $p(2) \\ge q(1)$, and $p(3) < q(1)$.\nWe also have $p(1) \\ge q(1)$, $p(2) \\ge q(2)$, $p(3) \\ge q(3)$.\nFrom $p(1) < q(2)$ and $p(2) \\ge q(2)$, we get $p(1) < p(2)$.\nFrom $p(3) < q(1)$ and $p(2) \\ge q(1)$, we get $p(3) < p(2)$.\nSo, $p(2)$ must be greater than both $p(1)$ and $p(3)$, which means $p(2)=3$. $\\{p(1), p(3)\\} = \\{1,2\\}$.\nAlso, from $p(3) < q(1) \\le p(1)$, we have $p(3) < p(1)$, so $p(3)=1$ and $p(1)=2$.\nThis gives the permutation $p$ as $(p(1),p(2),p(3)) = (2,3,1)$.\n\nNow let's find $q$. The conditions on $q$ become:\n$2 \\ge q(1)$\n$3 \\ge q(2)$ (always true)\n$1 \\ge q(3) \\implies q(3)=1$\n$2 < q(2) \\implies q(2)=3$\n$3 \\ge q(1)$ (always true)\n$1 < q(1)$\nFrom $1 < q(1)$ and $2 \\ge q(1)$, it must be that $q(1)=2$.\nSince $q$ is a permutation and we have found $q(1)=2, q(2)=3, q(3)=1$, we have a candidate solution for $q$: $(q(1),q(2),q(3))=(2,3,1)$.\nLet's verify this pair of permutations: $p = (2,3,1)$ and $q = (2,3,1)$.\nNon-zero likelihood conditions:\n$p(1) \\ge q(1) \\implies 2 \\ge 2$ (True)\n$p(2) \\ge q(2) \\implies 3 \\ge 3$ (True)\n$p(3) \\ge q(3) \\implies 1 \\ge 1$ (True)\nValue of $k_M$:\n$M_{12} = \\mathbb{I}\\{p(1) \\ge q(2)\\} = \\mathbb{I}\\{2 \\ge 3\\} = 0$\n$M_{21} = \\mathbb{I}\\{p(2) \\ge q(1)\\} = \\mathbb{I}\\{3 \\ge 2\\} = 1$\n$M_{31} = \\mathbb{I}\\{p(3) \\ge q(1)\\} = \\mathbb{I}\\{1 \\ge 2\\} = 0$\nSo, $k_M = 0+1+0=1$.\n\nSince we have proven that $k_M \\ne 0$ and have found a valid construction for $k_M=1$, the minimum possible value of $k_M$ for the GFG class is $1$.\nThe maximized likelihood for the GFG class is therefore:\n$$\\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{GFG}}(\\epsilon) = (1-\\epsilon)^3 \\epsilon^1 = \\epsilon(1-\\epsilon)^3$$\n\n**Likelihood-Ratio Test Statistic**\nFinally, we compute the generalized LRT statistic $\\Lambda(\\epsilon)$:\n$$\\Lambda(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{MA}}(\\epsilon)}{\\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{GFG}}(\\epsilon)} = \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)^3}{\\epsilon(1-\\epsilon)^3}$$\nAssuming $\\epsilon \\neq 1$, we can cancel the $(1-\\epsilon)^3$ terms. The problem statement gives $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, which justifies this cancellation.\n$$\\Lambda(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$$\n\nThe expression is fully simplified.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}\n$$", "id": "2716827"}]}
