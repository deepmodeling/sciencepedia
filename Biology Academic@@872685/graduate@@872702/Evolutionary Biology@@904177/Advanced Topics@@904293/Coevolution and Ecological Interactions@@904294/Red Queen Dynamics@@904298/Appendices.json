We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describes the coevolution of a host allele frequency, $x$, and a parasite allele frequency, $y$.

At equilibrium, $\\dot{x} = 0$ and $\\dot{y} = 0$. For an interior equilibrium, both $x(1-x)$ and $y(1-y)$ are non-zero. This forces the selection gradients to be zero:\n$$ a - by^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies y^{\\ast} = \\frac{a}{b} $$\n$$ c - dx^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies x^{\\ast} = \\frac{c}{d} $$\nFor this equilibrium to be in the interior of the state space, we must satisfy the constraints $0  x^{\\ast}  1$ and $0  y^{\\ast}  1$.

The Wright-Fisher model, negative frequency-dependent selection, and the concept of Red Queen dynamics are all standard, well-established topics in evolutionary biology. The models presented are appropriate simplifications for investigating such dynamics.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the identification of appropriate null models for a statistical hypothesis test, which is a standard and necessary step in scientific inference from time-series data. The goal—to distinguish an RQD model from simpler, non-coevolutionary alternatives—is clear and meaningful.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and objective. It provides mathematical definitions and avoids subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is coherent, scientifically sound, and well-posed. There are no fatal ambiguities or contradictions. The slight ambiguity regarding the sample size in the binomial distribution ($n_t$ diploid hosts vs. number of alleles) is a common notational shortcut in the field and does not impede a rigorous interpretation of the problem. The problem is **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Analysis\nThe core of the problem is one of statistical inference: how to establish evidence for a specific complex process (Red Queen dynamics) from observational time-series data. The data, $\\{\\hat{p}_t\\}$ and $\\{\\hat{q}_t\\}$, exhibit oscillations. The RQD model, characterized by endogenously coupled negative frequency-dependent selection (e.g., $s_H(t) \\propto q_t$ and $s_P(t) \\propto p_t$), provides one mechanistic explanation for such oscillations. However, a rigorous scientific conclusion requires demonstrating that this complex model is a significantly better explanation for the data than simpler, alternative processes that do not involve such coevolutionary coupling. These simpler alternatives are the null models. The task is to identify which of the provided options describe appropriate null models and the correct logic for their use.\n\n**Option A Analysis:**\nThis option proposes two null models: (i) a neutral Wright-Fisher model and (ii) a model with constant directional selection.\n1.  **The Neutral Model ($s_H=0$, $s_P=0$):** This model posits that all observed dynamics are the result of random genetic drift (with variance dependent on $N_e(t)$) and sampling error. In a finite time series, random walks produced by drift can exhibit transient, pseudo-cyclic patterns. It is mandatory to test whether the observed oscillations are statistically distinguishable from pure noise.\n2.  **The Constant Selection Model ($s_H=s_0$, $s_P=r_0$):** This model tests if a simple, non-frequency-dependent selective pressure is sufficient to explain the data. For instance, a selective sweep (a rapid increase in frequency of a beneficial allele) might be mistaken for one-half of an oscillation. This is a simpler form of natural selection than RQD and lacks the crucial host-parasite coupling.\nThe justification provided is correct: these non-coevolutionary processes can generate dynamics that might be confused with RQD, especially with noisy and finite data. Therefore, the RQD model must provide a substantially better fit to the data (as measured by likelihood, AIC, BIC, or other evidence criteria) to be accepted over these more parsimonious nulls. This option describes the foundational layer of null hypothesis testing in this context.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Analysis:**\nThis option suggests fitting sinusoidal functions to the time series and interpreting a statistically significant fit as direct evidence for RQD. This is a phenomenological, not a mechanistic, approach. Its core premise that \"oscillations are unique to antagonistic coevolution\" is factually incorrect. As discussed in the analysis of options A and C, other processes can generate oscillatory or pseudo-oscillatory dynamics. Merely fitting a sine wave demonstrates that the data have a periodic component; it does not in any way test the underlying process generating that periodicity. This approach confuses correlation (data looks like a sine wave) with causation (the cause must be the specific mechanism of RQD). It fails to compare the RQD hypothesis against any alternative mechanistic model, which is a critical failure of scientific inference.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Analysis:**\nThis option proposes an additional null model of exogenous fluctuating selection, where selection coefficients $s_H(t)$ and $s_P(t)$ are driven by an external environmental covariate $E_t$, independent of the allele frequencies $p_t$ and $q_t$. For example, if both host resistance and parasite infectivity are temperature-dependent, seasonal temperature fluctuations could drive oscillations in both $p_t$ and $q_t$. A phase lag could easily arise if, for instance, the host and parasite populations have different response times or sensitivities to the environmental changes. This creates dynamics that can perfectly mimic the pattern of RQD, but for a completely different reason (common forcing by an external factor, not endogenous biotic coupling). The justification is therefore precise and correct: to distinguish endogenous (RQD) from exogenous drivers, one must explicitly model the effect of potential environmental covariates and compare the explanatory power of this model to the RQD model. This is a critical step to avoid a major confounding factor.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option D Analysis:**\nThis option proposes using Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) as the null model. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts. HWE describes the expected relationship between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies within a population at a single point in time, under a specific set of assumptions (including no selection and random mating). The problem at hand concerns the *dynamics of allele frequencies over time* ($\\Delta p_t$, $\\Delta q_t$). RQD is a model for $\\Delta p_t$ and $\\Delta q_t$. It is a process that unfolds across generations. While strong selection can cause deviations from HWE, HWE is not a specific test for RQD. Many evolutionary processes, including simple directional selection (as in null model A), can cause such deviations. Conversely, RQD could occur with genotype frequencies that are statistically indistinguishable from HWE, especially if selection is weak. Therefore, a test for HWE is neither a necessary nor a sufficient tool for inferring RQD dynamics. It answers the wrong question. It does not provide a null model for the inter-generational dynamics of allele frequencies.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2748421"}]}
