It presents a standard exercise in theoretical quantitative genetics applied to the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation from first principles.\n\nThe immediate direction of selection on a quantitative trait is determined by the directional selection gradient, denoted by $\\beta$. The Price equation provides the fundamental basis for this concept. The change in a mean trait $\\bar{z}$ is given by $\\Delta \\bar{z} = \\text{Cov}(w, z) + \\text{E}(w \\Delta z)$, where $w$ is relative fitness, $z$ is the trait, $\\text{Cov}$ is covariance, and $\\text{E}$ is expectation. The problem specifies that transmission bias is negligible, so the second term, $\\text{E}(w \\Delta z)$, can be ignored. Under the assumption of weak selection, the change in the mean trait is well-approximated by $\\Delta \\bar{z} \\approx G \\beta_z$, where $G$ is the additive genetic variance for the trait. The selection gradient $\\beta_z$ is defined as the partial derivative of an individual's relative fitness with respect to their own trait value, evaluated at the population mean trait. We apply this definition to derive the selection gradients for species A and species B.\n\nLet us first consider species A. Let $z_A'$ denote the trait value of an individual in species A, while $z_A$ is the mean trait value for the entire species. The problem states that high gene flow homogenizes the trait mean across all $K$ patches. Therefore, the fitness of an individual with trait $z_A'$ is averaged across the landscape. The absolute fitness of this individual, $W_A(z_A')$, is the weighted average of its fitness in each patch $k$, where the weights are the patch frequencies $\\pi_k$. The fitness depends on the individual's trait $z_A'$ and the mean trait of the interacting species B, $z_B$.\n$$W_A(z_A', z_B) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k f_k(z_A', z_B)$$\nThe mean absolute fitness of the entire species A population, $\\bar{W}_A$, is found by evaluating $W_A(z_A', z_B)$ at the population mean trait value, $z_A' = z_A$.\n$$\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k f_k(z_A, z_B)$$\nThe relative fitness of an individual with trait $z_A'$ is its absolute fitness divided by the mean absolute fitness of the population.\n$$w_A(z_A') = \\frac{W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)}$$\nThe directional selection gradient on trait $z_A$, denoted $\\beta_A$, is the partial derivative of this relative fitness function with respect to the individual's trait $z_A'$, evaluated at the population mean $z_A$.\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{\\partial w_A(z_A')}{\\partial z_A'} \\bigg|_{z_A' = z_A}$$\nWe compute this derivative using the quotient rule. It is crucial to note that $\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)$ is a function of the population mean trait $z_A$ and is therefore treated as a constant with respect to the individual trait variable $z_A'$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial w_A(z_A')}{\\partial z_A'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_A'} \\left( \\frac{W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)} \\frac{\\partial W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\partial z_A'}$$\nThe derivative of the individual's absolute fitness is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\partial z_A'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_A'} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k f_k(z_A', z_B) \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial f_k(z_A', z_B)}{\\partial z_A'}$$\nEvaluating this at $z_A' = z_A$ gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial W_A(z_A', z_B)}{\\partial z_A'} \\bigg|_{z_A' = z_A} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial f_k(z_A, z_B)}{\\partial z_A}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\beta_A$, we obtain:\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{1}{\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial f_k(z_A, z_B)}{\\partial z_A}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\bar{W}_A(z_A, z_B)$:\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\frac{\\partial f_k(z_A, z_B)}{\\partial z_A}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k f_k(z_A, z_B)}$$\nThis is the selection gradient on trait $z_A$. It is the landscape-averaged selection pressure, normalized by the landscape-averaged mean fitness.\n\nThe derivation for species B follows an identical logic. Let $z_B'$ be the trait of an individual from species B, and $z_B$ be the population mean. The absolute fitness of this individual, $W_B(z_A, z_B')$, depends on its own trait and the mean trait of species A, $z_A$.\n$$W_B(z_A, z_B') = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k g_k(z_A, z_B')$$\nThe mean absolute fitness of the species B population is:\n$$\\bar{W}_B(z_A, z_B) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k g_k(z_A, z_B)$$\nThe relative fitness of the individual is $w_B(z_B') = W_B(z_A, z_B') / \\bar{W}_B(z_A, z_B)$.

Whole-genome resequencing and mark–recapture estimates indicate that pairwise migration rates among lakes are effectively zero (for all lake pairs $i \\neq j$, $m_{ij} \\approx 0$ per generation), and demographic reconstructions show effective population sizes (effective population size, $N_e$) in each lake are sufficiently large that genetic drift is negligible over the timescale of the study. The ecological contexts that mediate interaction strength (predator densities, nutrient loads, and thermal regimes) differ among lakes and are stable across the study period.\n\nThe Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution (GMTC) posits three core processes: geographic selection mosaics, coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots, and trait remixing through gene flow and genetic drift.

The third process, (3) trait remixing via gene flow and genetic drift, is explicitly stated to be absent.\n-   **Question:** The query asks to identify which predictions of the GMTC are expected to hold (\"persist\") and which are expected to be unsupported (\"fail\") in this specific system that lacks trait remixing.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem presents a hypothetical but biologically plausible scenario based on well-documented natural systems.\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in evolutionary biology, specifically the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution. The concepts used—selection gradients, gene flow ($m_{ij}$), genetic drift ($N_e$), hotspots, coldspots, and selection mosaics—are standard and well-defined in the field. The setup is a valid theoretical exploration.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of conditions ($m_{ij} \\approx 0$, negligible drift) and asks for the logical consequences within a specified theoretical framework (GMTC). A unique, meaningful solution can be deduced.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness:** The premises are internally consistent. The existence of a selection mosaic and hotspots/coldspots is a direct result of the stated stable, heterogeneous ecological contexts across isolated lakes. The absence of trait remixing is a direct consequence of the stated conditions of zero migration and negligible drift. The problem is self-contained.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a rigorous and well-formulated question in theoretical evolutionary ecology. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe GMTC framework posits three interacting processes that together shape the coevolutionary landscape. The problem requires us to analyze the consequences of having only the first two processes active.\n\n1.  **Processes that Persist and their Predictions:**\n    -   **Geographic Selection Mosaic:** The problem states that ecological contexts differ among lakes. This environmental heterogeneity is the fundamental driver of spatial variation in natural selection on the interacting species. This mosaic is the primary cause of the observed pattern of hotspots and coldspots. Therefore, the existence of a \"patchwork of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots\" is a direct and persistent consequence.\n    -   **Local Coevolutionary Dynamics:** Within each isolated lake, particularly the hotspots, strong reciprocal selection will operate. This local selection will drive the coevolution of hosts and parasites. Over time, this process is expected to lead to local adaptation, where parasites are better at infecting their local hosts, and hosts are better at resisting their local parasites. This creates a statistical association, or **positive within-lake covariance**, between the specific interaction traits of the co-occurring host and parasite populations. This is a core outcome of local coevolutionary arms races or matching-alleles dynamics, and it does not require gene flow between populations.\n\n2.  **Processes that are Absent and the Predictions that Fail:**\n    -   **Trait Remixing:** The problem explicitly removes this process by setting migration to zero ($m_{ij} \\approx 0$) and drift to be negligible. Trait remixing is the engine for several key large-scale GMTC predictions.\n    -   **Gene-Flow–Generated Trait Mismatches:** A key prediction of the full GMTC is that immigration can introduce alleles from populations with different selective histories. This can lead to local populations being \"mismatched\" to their current environment (e.g., hosts being susceptible to local parasites because of the influx of susceptible alleles from a coldspot). Without gene flow, this predicted source of maladaptation is eliminated.\n    -   **Broad Geographic Clines:** Smooth geographic gradients (clines) in allele or trait frequencies are often formed by a balance between spatially varying selection and the homogenizing effect of gene flow connecting populations along the gradient. Without migration to connect the isolated lakes, no such migration-selection balance can be established. Each lake evolves as an independent demographic and genetic unit, resulting in a discrete mosaic rather than a smooth cline.\n    -   **Rapid Geographic Turnover of Hotspots:** In the full GMTC, gene flow allows for the spread of novel coevolutionary adaptations (e.g., a new parasite infectivity allele or host resistance allele). The arrival of such an allele can rapidly shift the local coevolutionary dynamics, potentially turning a coldspot into a hotspot or altering the selective pressures within an existing hotspot. Without the \"remixing\" effect of gene flow, the status of a lake as a hotspot or coldspot will be determined primarily by its stable local ecological conditions and will not exhibit rapid turnover due to inter-population genetic exchange.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Persist: spatial variation in selection generating a patchwork of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots, and positive within-lake covariance between host and parasite interaction traits in hotspots; Fail: predictions that rely on trait remixing, including gene-flow–generated trait mismatches across neighboring lakes, spatial clines caused by migration–selection balance, and rapid geographic turnover of hotspot locations due to allelic spread.**\n    This option correctly identifies that the selection mosaic and its consequences (hotspots/coldspots) will persist. It also correctly states that local reciprocal selection will lead to positive trait covariance within hotspots. Furthermore, it accurately lists the key GMTC predictions that depend on gene flow (trait mismatches, clines, hotspot turnover) and will therefore fail in this system. This aligns perfectly with the derivation. **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. Persist: migration-driven trait mismatches and geographically smooth clines in interaction traits even with $m_{ij} \\approx 0$; Fail: the hotspot–coldspot structure, because gene flow is necessary to produce coevolutionary hotspots.**\n    This option is incorrect on both counts. \"Migration-driven\" phenomena cannot persist when migration is zero. The failure of the hotspot–coldspot structure is also incorrect; these are generated by local selective differences, not by gene flow. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Persist: maintenance of within-lake polymorphism for interaction traits via continual influx of alleles from other lakes; Fail: any geographic structure in trait matching, because without trait remixing local selection cannot generate spatial pattern.**\n    This is incorrect. The \"persist\" claim requires gene flow, which is absent. The \"fail\" claim is a fundamental error; local section is precisely what *generates* the geographic pattern (the mosaic) in the first place. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Persist: all standard GMTC predictions (hotspots and coldspots, geographic selection mosaics, trait mismatches caused by immigration, broad clines in traits, and frequent turnover in hotspot locations); Fail: none, because the three processes are not jointly necessary.**\n    This is incorrect. It fails to recognize that a subset of predictions is entirely dependent on the process of trait remixing (gene flow). While the three processes may not be necessary for *any* pattern to emerge, they are jointly required for the *full suite* of predictions of the complete theory. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **E. Persist: isolation-by-distance clines in neutral markers and interaction traits arising from drift alone; Fail: positive covariance between interacting species’ traits within hotspots, because without remixing reciprocal selection cannot align traits locally.**\n    This is incorrect. The \"persist\" claim is invalid because the problem states drift is negligible. The \"fail\" claim is also incorrect; local reciprocal selection is exactly what generates positive covariance (local alignment of traits), and gene flow (remixing) often acts to disrupt this local pattern. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the GMTC framework and the specific conditions of the problem, Option A is the only logically sound conclusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2719785"}, {"introduction": "A central prediction of the Geographic Mosaic Theory is that coevolutionary outcomes are not random in space but form a \"mosaic\" of hotspots and coldspots.

Product is $(-0.5)(-0.5) = 0.25$.\n    The sum over unique edges is $0.25 - 0.25 - 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 - 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.25$.\n    The full numerator term is $2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5$.\n\n8.  **Final calculation of $I$**:\n    $$ I = \\frac{6}{14} \\frac{0.5}{1.5} = \\frac{6}{14} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{14} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.142857 $$\n    So, the observed Moran's $I$ is approximately $0.143$.\n\n### Step 3: Permutation Test and p-value\n\nThe null hypothesis states that the $3$ hotspots are randomly allocated among the $6$ sites. There are $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$ such configurations. The one-sided $p$-value for positive autocorrelation (clustering) is the proportion of these configurations for which the Moran's $I$ is greater than or equal to the observed value $I_{obs} \\approx 0.143$.\n\nThe value of $I$ is a monotonic function of the numerator term, as other terms are constant across permutations. We need to find the number of configurations (out of $20$) that result in a Moran's $I \\ge 1/7$. This is equivalent to finding the number of configurations where the numerator term is $\\ge 0.5$.\n\nThe numerator is determined by the number of edges connecting two hotspots ($E_{11}$), a hotspot and a coldspot ($E_{10}$), and two coldspots ($E_{00}$).\nThe sum $\\sum \\sum w_{ij}(x_i-\\bar{x})(x_j-\\bar{x})$ is $2 \\times [ E_{11}(0.25) + E_{00}(0.25) + E_{10}(-0.25) ]$.\nThe total number of edges is 7, so $E_{10} = 7 - E_{11} - E_{00}$.\nThe numerator becomes $0.5 \\times [E_{11} + E_{00} - (7 - E_{11} - E_{00})] = E_{11} + E_{00} - 3.5$. No, this is incorrect.\nLet's restart the sum over pairs correctly. Sum is $0.25 \\times (E_{11} + E_{00} - E_{10})$. Total numerator is $2 \\times 0.25 \\times (E_{11} + E_{00} - E_{10}) = 0.5 \\times (E_{11} + E_{00} - (7-E_{11}-E_{00})) = E_{11} + E_{00} - 3.5$. Still seems wrong. Let me re-verify the single sum.\nSum over unique edges is $0.25$. Numerator is $2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5$. Yes.\nThe numerator is maximized when the number of `1-1` and `0-0` pairs is maximized. Let's find the configurations that achieve this.\nA set of 3 hotspot vertices can have 0, 1, or 2 internal edges. Its complement (3 coldspot vertices) can also have 0, 1, or 2 internal edges. We want to maximize $E_{11} + E_{00}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $E_{11}+E_{00}$ on this graph is 4. This occurs for configurations where the 3 hotspots form a path (2 edges) and the 3 coldspots also form a path (2 edges).\nThe paths of length 3 are: {1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {1,4,5}, {2,5,6}, {1,2,5}, {2,3,6}. My previous manual check was better.\nLet's recheck the sets of 3 vertices with 2 edges:\n- {1,2,3} (edges 1-2, 2-3). Complement {4,5,6} (edges 4-5, 5-6). $E_{11}=2, E_{00}=2$. Total = 4.\n- {1,2,4} (edges 1-2, 1-4). Complement {3,5,6} (edges 5-6, 3-6). $E_{11}=2, E_{00}=2$. Total = 4.\n- {1,4,5} (edges 1-4, 4-5). Complement {2,3,6} (edges 2-3, 3-6). $E_{11}=2, E_{00}=2$. Total = 4.\n- {2,3,6}, {2,5,6}, {3,5,6}, {4,5,6} are also sets with 2 edges. Their complements will have 2 edges as shown above.\nThere are 6 such configurations where the hotspot set has 2 internal edges. (The hotspot sets are {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,4,5}, {2,3,6}, {3,5,6}, {4,5,6}).\nFor these 6 configurations, $E_{11}=2$. The complement set also has 2 edges, so $E_{00}=2$. Then $E_{10} = 7 - 2 - 2 = 3$.\nNumerator = $0.5 \\times (2 + 2 - 3) = 0.5$. This gives $I=1/7$.\nSo there are 6 configurations that give the maximum possible value of $I$.\nThe observed configuration is one of these 6. The $p$-value is the number of configurations with $I \\ge I_{obs}$ divided by the total number of configurations. Since $I_{obs}$ is the maximum possible value, the p-value is (number of configs with max value) / (total configs).\n$$ p = \\frac{6}{20} = 0.3 $$\nThe result is not statistically significant ($p > 0.05$).\n\n### Step 4: Option Analysis\n\n- **A. Moran’s $I \\approx 0.143$ with one-sided $p \\approx 0.30$ (not significant). There is weak, non-significant positive spatial autocorrelation; at this grain, selection hotspots are not detectably clustered. This is consistent with a fine-grained mosaic under GMT where gene flow and spatially heterogeneous selection produce rapid turnover and trait remixing, blurring clusters at this scale.**\n  - The numerical results ($I \\approx 0.143$, $p=0.30$) are correct.\n  - The statistical conclusion (\"not significant\") is correct.\n  - The interpretation of the result is correct.\n  - The ecological interpretation is plausible and consistent with the GMT framework.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Moran’s $I \\approx 0.143$ with one-sided $p  0.05$ (significant). Hotspots are significantly clustered, indicating spatially coherent coevolutionary “hot” regions that are stable under GMT.**\n  - The $p$-value is incorrect, making the conclusion of significance incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Moran’s $I \\approx -0.200$ (equal to the null expectation) with one-sided $p \\approx 1.000$; the pattern is indistinguishable from random, implying no spatial structure and thus no evidence for a geographic mosaic under GMT.**\n  - The value of $I$ is incorrect. The observed value is positive, not equal to the null expectation (which is negative).\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Moran’s $I \\approx -1.000$ with one-sided $p  0.01$; hotspots are strongly overdispersed in a checkerboard, implying antagonistic selection prevents adjacent sites from simultaneously being hotspots, contradicting GMT’s expectation of patchy clustering.**\n  - The value of $I$ is incorrect and outside the possible range for this dataset.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Moran’s $I \\approx 0.600$ with one-sided $p \\approx 0.05$; hotspots are moderately to strongly clustered, consistent with limited gene flow and spatially coherent abiotic drivers producing large, contiguous hotspot patches.**\n  - The value of $I$ is incorrect and outside the possible range. The p-value is also incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe calculations and interpretations in Option A are correct and consistent. Final confirmation is that option A is the best choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2719811"}]}
