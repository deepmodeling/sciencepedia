A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe number of $A/a$ offspring, $k$, is observed from a total of $n$ offspring. According to the problem statement, the process is modeled by a binomial distribution, $k \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, t)$. The probability mass function for observing $k$ successes in $n$ trials is:\n$$ P(K=k | n, t) = \\binom{n}{k} t^k (1-t)^{n-k} $$\nThe likelihood function, $L(t)$, is proportional to this probability, considered as a function of the parameter $t$ for the observed data ($n, k$):\n$$ L(t; k, n) = \\binom{n}{k} t^k (1-t)^{n-k} $$\nFor analytical convenience, we work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood $\\ell(t)$:\n$$ \\ell(t) = \\ln(L(t)) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{n}{k}\\right) + k \\ln(t) + (n-k) \\ln(1-t) $$\n\n**1. Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for $t$**\nTo find the MLE, $\\hat{t}$, we differentiate the log-likelihood function with respect to $t$ and set the derivative to zero. This first derivative is the score function, $S(t)$.\n$$ S(t) = \\frac{d\\ell}{dt} = \\frac{k}{t} - \\frac{n-k}{1-t} $$\nSetting the score to zero to find the critical point:\n$$ \\frac{k}{t} - \\frac{n-k}{1-t} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{k}{t} = \\frac{n-k}{1-t} $$\n$$ k(1-t) = t(n-k) $$\n$$ k - kt = nt - kt $$\n$$ k = nt $$\nSolving for $t$ gives the maximum likelihood estimator:\n$$ \\hat{t} = \\frac{k}{n} $$\n\n**2. Verification of the Maximum**\nTo confirm that $\\hat{t}$ corresponds to a maximum, we examine the second derivative of the log-likelihood function.\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\ell}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{k}{t} - \\frac{n-k}{1-t}\\right) = -\\frac{k}{t^2} - \\frac{n-k}{(1-t)^2} $$\nFor the given data, $n=800$ and $k=520$. Thus, $k > 0$ and $n-k > 0$. For any $t$ in the domain $(0,1)$, both $t^2$ and $(1-t)^2$ are positive. Therefore, the second derivative is the sum of two negative terms:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\ell}{dt^2} < 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\in (0,1) $$\nSince the second derivative is always negative, the log-likelihood function is strictly concave over its domain. This proves that the critical point $\\hat{t} = k/n$ is the unique global maximum.\n\n**3. Asymptotic $95\\%$ Confidence Interval**\nThe asymptotic confidence interval is based on the normal approximation to the distribution of the MLE. The variance of $\\hat{t}$ is approximated by the inverse of the Fisher information. The problem specifies using the *observed* Fisher information, $I_O(t)$, which is defined as the negative of the second derivative of the log-likelihood, evaluated at the MLE, $\\hat{t}$.\n$$ I_O(\\hat{t}) = -\\left.\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dt^2}\\right|_{t=\\hat{t}} = -\\left(-\\frac{k}{\\hat{t}^2} - \\frac{n-k}{(1-\\hat{t})^2}\\right) = \\frac{k}{\\hat{t}^2} + \\frac{n-k}{(1-\\hat{t})^2} $$\nSubstituting $\\hat{t} = k/n$ and $1-\\hat{t} = (n-k)/n$:\n$$ I_O(\\hat{t}) = \\frac{k}{(k/n)^2} + \\frac{n-k}{((n-k)/n)^2} = \\frac{kn^2}{k^2} + \\frac{(n-k)n^2}{(n-k)^2} = \\frac{n^2}{k} + \\frac{n^2}{n-k} $$\n$$ I_O(\\hat{t}) = \\frac{n^2(n-k) + n^2k}{k(n-k)} = \\frac{n^3}{k(n-k)} $$\nAlternatively, a simpler expression can be obtained:\n$$ I_O(\\hat{t}) = \\frac{n\\hat{t}}{\\hat{t}^2} + \\frac{n(1-\\hat{t})}{(1-\\hat{t})^2} = \\frac{n}{\\hat{t}} + \\frac{n}{1-\\hat{t}} = \\frac{n(1-\\hat{t}) + n\\hat{t}}{\\hat{t}(1-\\hat{t})} = \\frac{n}{\\hat{t}(1-\\hat{t})} $$\nThe asymptotic variance of the MLE is the inverse of the observed Fisher information:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{t}) \\approx [I_O(\\hat{t})]^{-1} = \\frac{\\hat{t}(1-\\hat{t})}{n} $$\nThe standard error of the estimator is the square root of this variance:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{t}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{t}(1-\\hat{t})}{n}} $$\nA two-sided $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for $t$ is given by the Wald interval construction:\n$$ \\text{CI} = \\hat{t} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{t}) $$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The corresponding critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\nThe confidence interval is therefore:\n$$ \\hat{t} \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{t}(1-\\hat{t})}{n}} $$\n\n**4. Application to Data**\nWe are given $n = 800$ and $k = 520$.\nFirst, calculate the point estimate, $\\hat{t}$:\n$$ \\hat{t} = \\frac{k}{n} = \\frac{520}{800} = 0.65 $$\nNext, calculate the standard error, $\\text{SE}(\\hat{t})$:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{t}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.65(1-0.65)}{800}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.65 \\times 0.35}{800}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2275}{800}} = \\sqrt{0.000284375} \\approx 0.01686342 $$\nNow, calculate the margin of error (ME) for the $95\\%$ CI:\n$$ \\text{ME} = 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\hat{t}) \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.01686342 \\approx 0.0330523 $$\nThe lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval are:\n$$ \\text{Lower Bound} = \\hat{t} - \\text{ME} \\approx 0.65 - 0.0330523 = 0.6169477 $$\n$$ \\text{Upper Bound} = \\hat{t} + \\text{ME} \\approx 0.65 + 0.0330523 = 0.6830523 $$\nFinally, we round the results to four significant figures as required.\n- Point estimate $\\hat{t} = 0.65$ becomes $0.6500$.\n- Lower bound $0.6169477$ becomes $0.6169$.\n- Upper bound $0.6830523$ becomes $0.6831$.\n\nThe point estimate $\\hat{t} = 0.65$ is significantly different from the Mendelian expectation of $t=0.5$, as the $95\\%$ confidence interval $[0.6169, 0.6831]$ does not include $0.5$.

We proceed by modeling the discrete life cycle steps. Let $p$ be the frequency of the driving allele $D$ and $q=1-p$ be the frequency of the standard allele $d$ among zygotes.\n\n1.  Zygote Genotype Frequencies: Assuming a large, randomly mating population, the genotype frequencies among zygotes are given by the Hardy-Weinberg principle:\n    -   Frequency of $DD$: $f(DD) = p^{2}$\n    -   Frequency of $Dd$: $f(Dd) = 2pq = 2p(1-p)$\n    -   Frequency of $dd$: $f(dd) = q^{2} = (1-p)^{2}$\n\n2.  Viability Selection: Viability selection occurs before adulthood. The relative fitness values are given as $w_{DD} = 1-s$, $w_{Dd} = 1$, and $w_{dd} = 1$. The mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is calculated as the weighted average of the genotype frequencies:\n    $$ \\bar{w} = f(DD)w_{DD} + f(Dd)w_{Dd} + f(dd)w_{dd} $$\n    $$ \\bar{w} = p^{2}(1-s) + 2p(1-p)(1) + (1-p)^{2}(1) $$\n    $$ \\bar{w} = p^{2} - sp^{2} + 2p - 2p^{2} + 1 - 2p + p^{2} = 1 - sp^{2} $$\n    After selection, the genotype frequencies among the adults are normalized by the mean fitness:\n    -   Frequency of adult $DD$: $f'(DD) = \\frac{p^{2}(1-s)}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p^{2}(1-s)}{1-sp^{2}}$\n    -   Frequency of adult $Dd$: $f'(Dd) = \\frac{2p(1-p)}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{2p(1-p)}{1-sp^{2}}$\n    -   Frequency of adult $dd$: $f'(dd) = \\frac{(1-p)^{2}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{(1-p)^{2}}{1-sp^{2}}$\n\n3.  Gamete Production with Sex-Specific Meiosis: Gamete frequencies are determined from the adult genotype frequencies. Since the population has an equal sex ratio, we consider male and female gamete pools separately.\n    -   Male Gametes: Males transmit alleles fairly. The frequency of allele $D$ in the male gamete pool, $p_m$, is the frequency of allele $D$ among adults after selection.\n        $$ p_m = f'(DD) \\times 1 + f'(Dd) \\times 0.5 = \\frac{p^{2}(1-s)}{1-sp^{2}} + \\frac{2p(1-p)}{1-sp^{2}} \\times 0.5 $$\n        $$ p_m = \\frac{p^{2} - sp^{2} + p - p^{2}}{1-sp^{2}} = \\frac{p - sp^{2}}{1-sp^{2}} $$\n    -   Female Gametes: Heterozygous females exhibit meiotic drive, transmitting allele $D$ with probability $t$.

Allele Frequency in the Next Generation: With random union of gametes, the allele frequency $p'$ in the next generation of zygotes is the average of the gamete frequencies from males and females:\n    $$ p' = \\frac{p_m + p_f}{2} $$\n    A more insightful derivation of the recursion is to consider the change in allele frequency, $\\Delta p = p' - p$. The frequency of allele $D$ after selection in the adult population is $p_m$. Meiotic drive in females provides an additional change. The frequency of heterozygous females is $f'(Dd)$. These females produce a proportion $t$ of $D$ gametes, an excess of $t-0.5$ compared to fair meiosis. This excess contributes to the overall allele frequency change, but only affects half the gametes (those from females).\n    $$ p' = p_m + \\frac{1}{2} f'(Dd) (t-0.5) $$\n    $$ p' = \\frac{p-sp^{2}}{1-sp^{2}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2p(1-p)}{1-sp^{2}}(t-0.5) $$\n    $$ p' = \\frac{p - sp^{2} + p(1-p)(t-0.5)}{1-sp^{2}} $$\n    This is the required one-generation recursion for the frequency of allele $D$.\n\n5.

First, we must derive the model for the expected genotype proportions among live-born offspring and assess the identifiability of its parameters. Second, we must evaluate which of several additional data types would resolve the identifiability problem.\n\n**Part 1: Model Derivation and Identifiability**\n\nWe are given a cross between heterozygous females ($Aa$) and homozygous recessive males ($aa$).\nThe process from gametogenesis to live-born offspring involves two stages: meiotic segregation in the female and post-zygotic survival.\n\n1.  **Meiosis and Fertilization**:\n    A heterozygous $Aa$ female produces oocytes. The parameter $t$ is defined as the probability that an oocyte carries the allele $A$. Consequently, the probability that an oocyte carries the allele $a$ is $1-t$. Under Mendel’s First Law, $t$ would be equal to $0.5$. Meiotic drive implies $t \\ne 0.5$.\n    The $aa$ male produces only gametes carrying the allele $a$.\n    Assuming no fertilization bias, the genotype frequencies of the zygotes are determined by the oocyte frequencies:\n    -   Proportion of $Aa$ zygotes = (Proportion of $A$ oocytes) $\\times$ (Proportion of $a$ sperm) = $t \\times 1 = t$.\n    -   Proportion of $aa$ zygotes = (Proportion of $a$ oocytes) $\\times$ (Proportion of $a$ sperm) = $(1-t) \\times 1 = 1-t$.\n\n2.  **Post-Zygotic Survival**:\n    The survival probabilities from zygote to live birth for genotypes $Aa$ and $aa$ are given by $w_{Aa}$ and $w_{aa}$, respectively.\n    The proportion of the initial cohort of zygotes that survive to birth as genotype $Aa$ is $t \\cdot w_{Aa}$.\n    The proportion of the initial cohort of zygotes that survive to birth as genotype $aa$ is $(1-t) \\cdot w_{aa}$.\n    The total proportion of zygotes surviving to birth is the sum of these, which serves as a normalization factor: $Z = t \\cdot w_{Aa} + (1-t) \\cdot w_{aa}$.\n\n3.  **Expected Live-Born Proportions**:\n    The expected proportion of $Aa$ individuals among the live-born offspring, $P_{Aa}$, is:\n    $$ P_{Aa} = \\frac{t \\cdot w_{Aa}}{t \\cdot w_{Aa} + (1-t) \\cdot w_{aa}} $$\n    The expected proportion of $aa$ individuals among the live-born offspring, $P_{aa}$, is:\n    $$ P_{aa} = \\frac{(1-t) \\cdot w_{aa}}{t \\cdot w_{Aa} + (1-t) \\cdot w_{aa}} $$\n    It is trivial to see that $P_{Aa} + P_{aa} = 1$. This is the required mapping from the parameters $(t, w_{Aa}, w_{aa})$ to the observable proportions.\n\n4.  **Identifiability Analysis**:\n    The data from the cross consist of the counts of live-born offspring, $\\{n_{Aa}, n_{aa}\\}$. The total number of live-borns is $N = n_{Aa} + n_{aa}$. All information from this data is contained in a single quantity, for example, the observed proportion of $Aa$ offspring, $\\hat{P}_{Aa} = n_{Aa}/N$, or equivalently, the ratio of the counts, $n_{Aa}/n_{aa}$.\n    Let us examine the ratio of the expected proportions:\n    $$ \\frac{P_{Aa}}{P_{aa}} = \\frac{t \\cdot w_{Aa}}{(1-t) \\cdot w_{aa}} $$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $$ \\frac{P_{Aa}}{P_{aa}} = \\left( \\frac{t}{1-t} \\right) \\left( \\frac{w_{Aa}}{w_{aa}} \\right) $$\n    The absolute viabilities $w_{Aa}$ and $w_{aa}$ only influence the expected proportions through their ratio. Let us define the relative viability (or selection coefficient) as $w = w_{Aa}/w_{aa}$. The model for the observable ratio of genotypes is determined by two parameters: the transmission ratio $t$ and the relative viability $w$.\n    The data provide a single constraint, which is the observed ratio of counts $n_{Aa}/n_{aa}$, an estimate of $P_{Aa}/P_{aa}$. We have one equation with two unknown parameters, $t$ and $w$. An infinite number of pairs $(t, w)$ can produce the same observed ratio $n_{Aa}/n_{aa}$. For example, an observed excess of $Aa$ offspring ($n_{Aa} > n_{aa}$) could be explained by meiotic drive favoring $A$ ($t > 0.5$) with no selection ($w=1$), or by Mendelian segregation ($t=0.5$) with selection favoring $Aa$ ($w>1$), or by some combination of both effects.\n    Therefore, the parameters are structurally non-identifiable. We have fewer independent empirical constraints ($1$) than unknown parameters ($2$, namely $t$ and $w=w_{Aa}/w_{aa}$). The original parameter set $(t, w_{Aa}, w_{aa})$ is even less identifiable.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of Additional Data Types**\n\nTo achieve identifiability, we need to introduce at least one additional, independent constraint to solve for both $t$ and $w$.\n\n**A. Direct gamete-stage assay**\nThis procedure involves directly genotyping oocytes (or their associated polar bodies) from $Aa$ females. This measures the allele frequencies in the gametes *before* fertilization and selection. This assay provides a direct estimate of the transmission ratio, $t$, which is not confounded by post-zygotic viability effects. With $t$ estimated from this independent data source, we can substitute it into the equation for the live-born ratio:\n$$ \\frac{n_{Aa}}{n_{aa}} = \\left( \\frac{t}{1-t} \\right) w $$\nSince $n_{Aa}/n_{aa}$ is observed and $t$ is now known from the gamete assay, we can solve for the single remaining unknown, the relative viability $w$.\n$$ w = \\left( \\frac{n_{Aa}}{n_{aa}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1-t}{t} \\right) $$\nBoth parameters $t$ and $w$ become identifiable.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. A much larger sample size**\nIncreasing the sample size $N$ improves the statistical precision of the estimate of the proportion $n_{Aa}/N$. It reduces random sampling error and narrows confidence intervals. However, it provides no new type of information and does not add any independent mathematical constraint to the system. The problem is one of *structural* non-identifiability, not statistical power. No matter how precisely we measure the single ratio $n_{Aa}/n_{aa}$, we still have only one equation for two unknowns.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Reciprocal cross data**\nThis involves a new cross: $Aa$ males $\\times$ $aa$ females. A key assumption is the absence of meiotic drive in males, meaning sperm are produced in Mendelian proportions ($0.5$ for $A$, $0.5$ for $a$).\nIn this reciprocal cross, the zygote genotype frequencies are $0.5$ for $Aa$ and $0.5$ for $aa$. These zygotes are subject to the same viability selection ($w_{Aa}$, $w_{aa}$) as in the original cross. The ratio of live-born offspring from this cross, $\\tilde{n}_{Aa}/\\tilde{n}_{aa}$, will estimate:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{P}_{Aa}}{\\tilde{P}_{aa}} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot w_{Aa}}{0.5 \\cdot w_{aa}} = \\frac{w_{Aa}}{w_{aa}} = w $$\nThus, the reciprocal cross isolates and provides an estimate for the relative viability $w$. We can then use this estimate of $w$ in the equation for the original cross:\n$$ \\frac{n_{Aa}}{n_{aa}} = \\left( \\frac{t}{1-t} \\right) w $$\nWith $n_{Aa}/n_{aa}$ observed and $w$ now estimated, we can solve for the transmission ratio $t$.\n$$ \\frac{t}{1-t} = \\frac{1}{w} \\left( \\frac{n_{Aa}}{n_{aa}} \\right) $$\nBoth parameters $t$ and $w$ become identifiable.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium**\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) describes genotype frequencies in a large, randomly mating population. The offspring of a specific, non-random laboratory cross ($Aa \\times aa$) are not, and are not expected to be, in HWE. Applying HWE principles to the offspring generation is fundamentally incorrect. If the assumption refers to the parental \"base population,\" it provides no information about the parameters $t$ and $w$ that govern segregation and survival within this specific cross. This option introduces an irrelevant concept and no useful data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Pre-implantation embryo genotyping**\nGenotyping embryos at a very early stage (e.g., zygote) provides a snapshot of genotype frequencies after fertilization but before significant viability selection has occurred. The ratio of genotypes at this stage, $m_{Aa}/m_{aa}$, directly estimates the ratio of zygotic frequencies:\n$$ \\frac{m_{Aa}}{m_{aa}} \\approx \\frac{t}{1-t} $$\nThis provides an independent estimate of the transmission ratio $t$, unconfounded by $w$. This is analogous to option A. With $t$ (or its odds) known from the embryo data, we can use the live-born data $\\{n_{Aa}, n_{aa}\\}$ to solve for the relative viability $w$:\n$$ w = \\left( \\frac{n_{Aa}}{n_{aa}} \\right) / \\left( \\frac{t}{1-t} \\right) \\approx \\left( \\frac{n_{Aa}}{n_{aa}} \\right) / \\left( \\frac{m_{Aa}}{m_{aa}} \\right) $$\nBoth parameters become identifiable.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**F. Per-mother counts of total conceptuses**\nThis adds knowledge of the total number of initial zygotes, $C$, to the live-born data $\\{n_{Aa}, n_{aa}\\}$. This provides two empirical quantities: the ratio of live-born genotypes $K_1 = n_{Aa}/n_{aa}$ and the overall survival rate $K_2 = (n_{Aa}+n_{aa})/C$. The expected values are:\n1. $E[K_1] \\approx \\frac{t \\cdot w_{Aa}}{(1-t) \\cdot w_{aa}}$\n2. $E[K_2] \\approx t \\cdot w_{Aa} + (1-t) \\cdot w_{aa}$\nThe system now depends on three parameters: $t, w_{Aa}, w_{aa}$, because the overall survival rate $K_2$ is a function of absolute, not just relative, viabilities. We have two equations for three unknowns. We can express $w_{Aa}$ and $w_{aa}$ in terms of $t$:\n$$ w_{Aa} = \\frac{E[K_2] \\cdot E[K_1]}{t(1+E[K_1])} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w_{aa} = \\frac{E[K_2]}{(1-t)(1+E[K_1])} $$\nFor any chosen value of $t$ (within a valid range that ensures $w_{Aa}, w_{aa} \\in [0,1]$), we can find a corresponding pair $(w_{Aa}, w_{aa})$ that satisfies the two empirical constraints. Since $t$ is not uniquely determined, the system remains non-identifiable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{A, C, E}}$$", "id": "2696225"}]}
