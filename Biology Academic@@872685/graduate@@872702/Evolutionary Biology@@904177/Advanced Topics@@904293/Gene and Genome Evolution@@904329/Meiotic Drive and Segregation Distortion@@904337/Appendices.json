No viability selection implies $w_{S/s} = w_{s/s}$.\n- Task: Select the option that correctly contrasts the causal stages of the two mechanisms and proposes a decisive experiment to distinguish them.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem presents a classic scenario from evolutionary genetics. The concepts of segregation distortion (meiotic drive) and differential viability are fundamental, well-established mechanisms that cause deviations from expected Mendelian ratios. The parameters $t$ and $w$ are standard in population genetics models. The experimental setup and the observed data are scientifically plausible. The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed, asking for an experimental design to distinguish between two confounded hypotheses. There are no scientific or logical flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full analysis is warranted.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet us formalize the contributions of segregation and viability to the final offspring ratio.\nThe cross is $S/s$ male $\\times$ $s/s$ female.\nThe $S/s$ male produces gametes containing allele $S$ with probability $t$ and allele $s$ with probability $1-t$.\nThe $s/s$ female produces only gametes containing allele $s$.\n\nUpon fertilization, the genotypes of the zygotes are formed with the following frequencies:\n- Frequency of $S/s$ zygotes = (frequency of $S$ sperm) $\\times$ (frequency of $s$ egg) = $t \\times 1 = t$.\n- Frequency of $s/s$ zygotes = (frequency of $s$ sperm) $\\times$ (frequency of $s$ egg) = $(1-t) \\times 1 = 1-t$.\n\nThese zygotes must then survive to adulthood. Their survival is weighted by their relative viabilities, $w_{S/s}$ and $w_{s/s}$. Thus, the expected ratio of adult offspring is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Number of } S/s \\text{ adults}}{\\text{Number of } s/s \\text{ adults}} = \\frac{t \\cdot w_{S/s}}{(1-t) \\cdot w_{s/s}}\n$$\nThe observed data shows this ratio is $700 / 300 = 7/3$. Therefore, we have the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{t \\cdot w_{S/s}}{(1-t) \\cdot w_{s/s}} = \\frac{7}{3}\n$$\nThis single equation has two unknown parameters (or, more precisely, the ratio of parameters): the segregation ratio, determined by $t$, and the viability ratio, $w_{S/s}/w_{s/s}$. We cannot solve for both from a single observation of adult frequencies. Two non-exclusive hypotheses can explain the data:\n\nCase 1: Pure Segregation Distortion.\nHere, there is no differential viability, so we can set $w_{S/s} = w_{s/s} = 1$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{t}{1-t} = \\frac{7}{3} \\implies 3t = 7(1-t) \\implies 10t = 7 \\implies t = 0.7\n$$\nIn this scenario, the $S$ allele is transmitted to $70\\%$ of the functional gametes.\n\nCase 2: Pure Differential Viability.\nHere, segregation is strictly Mendelian, so $t = 1/2$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{(1/2) \\cdot w_{S/s}}{(1 - 1/2) \\cdot w_{s/s}} = \\frac{w_{S/s}}{w_{s/s}} = \\frac{7}{3}\n$$\nIn this scenario, $S/s$ individuals have a viability that is $7/3 \\approx 2.33$ times greater than that of $s/s$ individuals.\n\nThe fundamental difference between these two mechanisms is their point of action in the life cycle. Segregation distortion acts *pre-zygotically*, during gamete formation, altering the frequencies of alleles in the gamete pool. Differential viability acts *post-zygotically*, altering the frequencies of genotypes among developing organisms. A decisive experiment must, therefore, probe the state of the population at a life stage that separates these two processes. The formation of the zygote is this critical point.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. Segregation distortion changes $t$ during gamete production, whereas viability selection changes $w$ after zygote formation. To distinguish them, collect a time-stamped cohort of fertilized eggs from the $S/s$ male $\\times$ $s/s$ female cross, genotype a random sample at an early embryonic stage before appreciable mortality (e.g., within $2$ hours post-fertilization) to estimate the transmission ratio among embryos, and compare it to the adult ratio. Prediction: if embryos already show $S/s$:$s/s$ $\\approx 700\\!:\\!300$ (i.e., $t \\approx 0.7$) and the adult ratio matches, segregation distortion is implicated with $w_{S/s} \\approx w_{s/s}$; if embryos are $\\approx 1\\!:\\!1$ but adults are $700\\!:\\!300$, then $t \\approx 1/2$ and $w_{S/s} \\neq w_{s/s}$, indicating differential viability.\n\nThis option correctly identifies the causal stages of the two processes. The proposed experiment—genotyping individuals immediately after fertilization—is the definitive method to disentangle pre-zygotic from post-zygotic effects. If the genotypic ratio is already skewed among zygotes (or very early embryos, before viability selection can act), then the cause must be pre-zygotic, i.e., segregation distortion. If the zygote ratio is Mendelian ($1\\!:\\!1$) but the adult ratio is skewed, then the cause must be post-zygotic, i.e., differential viability. The predictions are stated precisely and correctly. This experimental design is sound and decisive.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Segregation distortion is male-limited and disappears in females, whereas viability selection is sex-neutral. To distinguish them, repeat the cross with an $S/s$ female $\\times$ $s/s$ male; if the ratio is $1\\!:\\!1$, the deviation in the original cross was segregation distortion; if it remains $700\\!:\\!300$, it was viability selection.\n\nThis option is based on generalizations that are not universally true. First, segregation distortion is not necessarily male-limited; meiotic drive in females exists. Second, viability selection is not necessarily sex-neutral; the fitness effect of a genotype can differ between the sexes. Therefore, the proposed reciprocal cross is not decisive. If the reciprocal cross yields a $1\\!:\\!1$ ratio, it only proves the effect is specific to the $S/s$ parent being male; this could be male-specific drive *or* a male-parent-of-origin effect on offspring viability. If the reciprocal cross yields a $700\\!:\\!300$ ratio, it could be viability selection *or* segregation distortion that occurs in both sexes. The premises are faulty and the conclusion is ambiguous.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Segregation distortion is insensitive to environmental conditions, whereas viability selection is environmentally sensitive. To distinguish them, repeat the $S/s$ male $\\times$ $s/s$ female cross at two temperatures. If the ratio is consistently $700\\!:\\!300$ across temperatures, the cause is segregation distortion; if the ratio changes with temperature, the cause is viability selection.\n\nThis premise is scientifically unsound. The expression of many meiotic drive systems is known to be sensitive to environmental factors, including temperature. Conversely, viability differences can be robust across a range of environments. An experimental result showing the ratio changes with temperature would not distinguish between temperature-sensitive drive and temperature-sensitive viability. A result showing no change would not distinguish between temperature-insensitive drive and temperature-insensitive viability. The experiment is not decisive because its foundational assumption is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Segregation distortion leaves zygote genotype frequencies Mendelian at conception but alters linkage relationships, whereas viability selection changes linkage but not initial genotype frequencies. To distinguish them, estimate recombination fractions near the $S$ locus in adult offspring; if recombination fractions deviate from map expectations, the cause is segregation distortion; if they match expectations, the cause is viability selection.\n\nThis option presents a nonsensical description of both phenomena. Segregation distortion, by its very definition, causes zygote genotype frequencies to be non-Mendelian ($t \\neq 1/2$). While some drive mechanisms are associated with chromosome rearrangements (like inversions) that suppress recombination (altering linkage), this is a common association, not a defining feature of drive itself. Furthermore, viability selection acts on genotypes; it does not alter recombination frequencies, which are determined during meiosis in the parents. The entire premise is a confusion of concepts.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2733643"}, {"introduction": "Building on the challenge of separating pre- and post-zygotic effects, real-world systems often involve further complexity, such as parent-of-origin effects on viability.

Under Mendelian segregation, a heterozygote ($Dd$) crossed to a homozygote ($dd$) produces zygotes in a $1{:}1$ ratio of $Dd{:}dd$. In contrast, meiotic drive (segregation distortion) is defined as a deviation from $1{:}1$ produced during gametogenesis, which can be sex-limited (occurring only in oogenesis or spermatogenesis). Maternal effects and paternal effects are defined as parent-of-origin influences on offspring survival or development that act after fertilization and can change genotype frequencies between early zygotes and later life stages without altering the fertilization-stage $1{:}1$ expectation from Mendelian segregation. A reciprocal cross is a pair of matings in which the genotypes of the male and female parents are swapped; comparing reciprocal crosses can disentangle effects arising in mothers versus fathers versus gametogenesis in a particular sex.\n\nResearchers perform reciprocal crosses and genotype offspring at two developmental stages: immediately after fertilization (zygotes) and at a later juvenile stage.

We must distinguish between meiotic drive, which affects gamete ratios and is thus observable at the zygote stage, and parent-of-origin effects on viability, which alter genotype frequencies after fertilization.\n\nLet us analyze the provided data step-by-step from first principles.\n\n**Analysis of Cross A: $Dd$ female $\\times$ $dd$ male**\n\n1.  **Zygote Stage**: The heterozygous ($Dd$) female produces eggs, and the homozygous recessive ($dd$) male produces sperm. The male produces only $d$-gametes. Therefore, the ratio of $Dd$ to $dd$ zygotes directly reflects the ratio of $D$ to $d$ gametes produced by the female. The observed zygote count is $Dd:dd = 300:300$. This is a ratio of $1:1$. According to the definition of Mendelian segregation, this is the expected outcome. The absence of deviation from the $1:1$ ratio at the zygote stage indicates that there is **no meiotic drive in females**.\n\n2.  **Juvenile Stage**: The count at the juvenile stage is $Dd:dd = 240:120$. This simplifies to a ratio of $2:1$. The genotype ratio has changed from $1:1$ at the zygote stage to $2:1$ at the juvenile stage. This change signifies differential survival of the offspring genotypes between fertilization and the juvenile stage.\n    Let $S_{Dd}$ and $S_{dd}$ be the survival probabilities of the $Dd$ and $dd$ genotypes, respectively, from the zygote to the juvenile stage in this cross.\n    The ratio of surviving individuals is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\text{Number of } Dd \\text{ juveniles}}{\\text{Number of } dd \\text{ juveniles}} = \\frac{\\text{Initial number of } Dd \\text{ zygotes} \\times S_{Dd}}{\\text{Initial number of } dd \\text{ zygotes} \\times S_{dd}} $$\n    Using the data:\n    $$ \\frac{240}{120} = \\frac{300 \\times S_{Dd}}{300 \\times S_{dd}} $$\n    $$ 2 = \\frac{S_{Dd}}{S_{dd}} $$\n    This demonstrates that $Dd$ offspring have double the survival probability of $dd$ offspring. Since this effect occurs in a cross where the mother has the genotype $Dd$, this is evidence for a **maternal-effect on viability** that favors the $Dd$ offspring.\n\n**Analysis of Cross B: $dd$ female $\\times$ Dd male**\n\n1.  **Zygote Stage**: The heterozygous ($Dd$) male produces sperm, and the homozygous recessive ($dd$) female produces eggs. The female produces only $d$-gametes. The zygote ratio directly reflects the ratio of $D$ to $d$ gametes produced by the male. The observed zygote count is $Dd:dd = 420:180$. This ratio simplifies to $420/180 = 42/18 = 7/3$. This is a significant deviation from the Mendelian $1:1$ expectation. The $Dd$ male produces gametes in a ratio of $7$ $D$-sperm for every $3$ $d$-sperm. This is, by definition, **male-limited meiotic drive favoring the $D$ allele**.\n\n2.  **Juvenile Stage**: The count at the juvenile stage is $Dd:dd = 336:144$. This ratio simplifies to $336/144 = 7/3$. The genotype ratio has not changed from the zygote stage ($7:3$) to the juvenile stage ($7:3$). Let us calculate the survival probabilities to confirm.\n    $$ S_{Dd} = \\frac{\\text{Number of } Dd \\text{ juveniles}}{\\text{Number of } Dd \\text{ zygotes}} = \\frac{336}{420} = 0.8 $$\n    $$ S_{dd} = \\frac{\\text{Number of } dd \\text{ juveniles}}{\\text{Number of } dd \\text{ zygotes}} = \\frac{144}{180} = 0.8 $$\n    The survival probabilities are equal. This confirms there is **no differential viability** among offspring in this cross. The mother in this cross is $dd$, so the absence of a viability effect is consistent with the hypothesis from Cross A that the effect is a maternal one, specific to $Dd$ mothers. Furthermore, the absence of a viability effect here rules out a paternal effect associated with the $Dd$ father.\n\n**Conclusion from Synthesis**\n\nThe combined analysis of both reciprocal crosses points to two distinct mechanisms:\n1.  **Male-limited meiotic drive**: The $7:3$ zygote ratio in Cross B demonstrates that $Dd$ males produce a disproportionate number of $D$-carrying gametes.\n2.  **Maternal-effect on viability**: The change in genotype ratios from zygote to juvenile in Cross A (but not in Cross B) demonstrates that offspring from a $Dd$ mother experience differential survival based on their genotype, with $Dd$ offspring having higher viability.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Female-limited meiotic drive favoring $D$ only**: This is incorrect. The zygote ratio in Cross A ($Dd$ female $\\times$ $dd$ male) is $300:300$, or $1:1$, which explicitly shows the absence of female meiotic drive.\n\n*   **B. Male-limited meiotic drive favoring $D$ only**: This is incomplete. While it correctly explains the $7:3$ zygote ratio in Cross B, it fails to explain the change in genotype ratio from $1:1$ to $2:1$ between the zygote and juvenile stages in Cross A. It predicts a $1:1$ juvenile ratio in Cross A, which contradicts the data ($240:120$).\n\n*   **C. Maternal-effect viability only (acting when the mother is $Dd$)**: This is incomplete. While it correctly explains the viability difference seen in Cross A, it fails to explain the non-Mendelian $7:3$ zygote ratio observed in Cross B. It predicts a $1:1$ zygote ratio in both crosses.\n\n*   **D. Male-limited meiotic drive favoring $D$ plus a maternal-effect viability acting when the mother is $Dd$**: This option is fully consistent with all observations.\n    - The male-limited meiotic drive explains the $7:3$ zygote ratio in Cross B ($Dd$ male) and is consistent with the $1:1$ zygote ratio in Cross A (where the male is $dd$ and segregation is expected to be normal from him).\n    - The maternal-effect on viability explains why the genotype ratio changes post-fertilization in Cross A ($Dd$ mother) but not in Cross B ($dd$ mother).\n    This hypothesis provides a complete explanation for the data. **Correct**.\n\n*   **E. Female-limited meiotic drive favoring $D$ plus a paternal-effect viability acting when the father is $Dd$**: This is incorrect on both counts. As established, there is no female meiotic drive (Cross A zygote ratio is $1:1$). There is also no evidence for a paternal effect on viability, as the genotype ratio in Cross B ($Dd$ father) does not change between the zygote and juvenile stages.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2733564"}, {"introduction": "After identifying and characterizing a meiotic drive system, the crucial evolutionary question becomes: what is its fate in a population?
