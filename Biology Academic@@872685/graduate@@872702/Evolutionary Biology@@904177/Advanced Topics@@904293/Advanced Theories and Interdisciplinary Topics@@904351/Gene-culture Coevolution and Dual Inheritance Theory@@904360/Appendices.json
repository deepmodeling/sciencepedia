In the framework of gene-culture coevolution and dual inheritance theory, assume cultural change proceeds via social learning events that occur one at a time. In each event, a role model is chosen from the population, and a randomly chosen learner adopts the role model’s cultural variant, replacing its current variant. There is no mutation (innovation occurs only once at the outset), and the only source of stochasticity is demographic sampling during social learning.\n\nHorizontal transmission occurs with rate parameter $\\beta$, meaning that payoff differences are expressed in model choice through horizontal social learning with strength proportional to $\\beta$. Let the innovative variant $I$ have a frequency-independent payoff advantage $s_c$ relative to $T$ (so that $I$’s payoff is $1 + s_c$ and $T$’s payoff is $1$). Assume that horizontal social learning biases model choice in proportion to an effective cultural fitness that linearly scales the payoff advantage by the horizontal transmission rate $\\beta$, so that the relative likelihoods of being chosen as a role model are proportional to $f_I = 1 + \\beta s_c$ for $I$ and $f_T = 1$ for $T$. This induces a birth–death cultural Moran process: at each update, a role model is chosen with probability proportional to its $f$, and a uniformly random learner adopts the role model’s variant.\n\nStarting from a single innovator (state $i=1$), derive from first principles the exact fixation probability (the probability that $I$ ultimately takes over the entire population) as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $N$, $\\beta$, and $s_c$.

It describes a standard birth-death process, specifically the Moran model with selection, framed within the context of cultural evolution. The problem is thus valid and permits a formal mathematical solution.\n\nWe will derive the fixation probability from first principles. The state of the system is defined by the number of individuals carrying the innovative variant $I$, which we denote by $i$. The population size is fixed at $N$, so there are $N-i$ individuals with the traditional variant $T$. The state space for $i$ is $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$. The states $i=0$ and $i=N$ are absorbing states, corresponding to the fixation of variant $T$ and $I$, respectively.\n\nThe process is a discrete-time Markov chain. At each step, a single event occurs, potentially changing the value of $i$ by $+1$, $-1$, or $0$. We must first determine the transition probabilities.\n\nAccording to the problem, a role model is chosen with a probability proportional to its effective cultural fitness, and a learner is chosen uniformly at random to adopt the role model's variant.\nThe effective cultural fitness values are given as $f_I = 1 + \\beta s_c$ for an individual of type $I$ and $f_T = 1$ for an individual of type $T$.\n\nThe total fitness in a population with $i$ innovators and $N-i$ traditionalists is the sum of all individual fitness values:\n$$ W_{total} = i \\cdot f_I + (N-i) \\cdot f_T = i(1 + \\beta s_c) + (N-i)(1) = N + i \\beta s_c $$\n\nThe probability of choosing an individual of type $I$ as the role model is the ratio of the total fitness of all $I$ individuals to the total fitness of the population:\n$$ P(\\text{model is } I) = \\frac{i f_I}{W_{total}} = \\frac{i(1 + \\beta s_c)}{N + i \\beta s_c} $$\nSimilarly, the probability of choosing an individual of type $T$ as the role model is:\n$$ P(\\text{model is } T) = \\frac{(N-i) f_T}{W_{total}} = \\frac{N-i}{N + i \\beta s_c} $$\n\nThe learner is chosen uniformly at random from the population of size $N$.\nThe number of innovators, $i$, increases by one (i.e., $i \\to i+1$) if an $I$ role model is chosen and a $T$ learner is chosen. There are $N-i$ individuals of type $T$. The probability of choosing a $T$ learner is $\\frac{N-i}{N}$.

Let us analyze the stability of the equilibria $x=0$ and $x=1$. Let the right-hand side of the differential equation be $f(x) = x(1-x)(\\beta-c)$.
