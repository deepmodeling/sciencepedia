The linear model for partitioning phenotypic variance is a standard and fundamental concept. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary definitions and conditions specified for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the total phenotypic variance, $V_P$. We begin with the definition of the phenotype, $P$.\n$$\nP \\;=\\; \\mu \\;+\\; G \\;+\\; E \\;+\\; I_{G\\times E} \\;+\\; I_{G\\times G} \\;+\\; \\epsilon\n$$\nThe variance of $P$, denoted $V_P$, is $\\operatorname{Var}(P)$. Since $\\mu$ is a constant, its variance is $0$, and it does not covary with any random variable. Thus, it does not contribute to $V_P$.\n$$\nV_P = \\operatorname{Var}(G \\;+\\; E \\;+\\; I_{G\\times E} \\;+\\; I_{G\\times G} \\;+\\; \\epsilon)\n$$\nThe variance of a sum of several random variables is the sum of their individual variances plus twice the sum of all unique pairwise covariances. Let the random components be $X_1 = G$, $X_2 = E$, $X_3 = I_{G\\times E}$, $X_4 = I_{G\\times G}$, and $X_5 = \\epsilon$. The general formula is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_i X_i\\right) = \\sum_i \\operatorname{Var}(X_i) + 2 \\sum_{ij} \\operatorname{Cov}(X_i, X_j)\n$$\nApplying this to our model, we have:\n$$\nV_P = \\operatorname{Var}(G) + \\operatorname{Var}(E) + \\operatorname{Var}(I_{G\\times E}) + \\operatorname{Var}(I_{G\\times G}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon) + 2\\sum_{\\text{pairs}} \\operatorname{Cov}\n$$\nThe sum of variances is, by definition, $V_G + V_E + V_{G\\times E} + V_{G\\times G} + V_{\\epsilon}$. Now, we must evaluate the covariance terms based on the problem's assumptions.\nThe term $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)$ is explicitly stated to be potentially non-zero.\nThe problem states that $I_{G\\times E}$, $I_{G\\times G}$, and $\\epsilon$ are uncorrelated with $G$ and $E$. This implies:\n$\\operatorname{Cov}(G, I_{G\\times E})=0$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(G, I_{G\\times G})=0$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(G, \\epsilon)=0$.\n$\\operatorname{Cov}(E, I_{G\\times E})=0$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(E, I_{G\\times G})=0$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(E, \\epsilon)=0$.\nFurthermore, the description of these terms as \"orthogonal random effects\" implies they are mutually uncorrelated. This means:\n$\\operatorname{Cov}(I_{G\\times E}, I_{G\\times G})=0$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(I_{G\\times E}, \\epsilon)=0$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(I_{G\\times G}, \\epsilon)=0$.\nTherefore, the only covariance term that is not necessarily zero is $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)$. The complete expression for the phenotypic variance is:\n$$\nV_P = V_G + V_E + V_{G\\times E} + V_{G\\times G} + V_{\\epsilon} + 2\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)\n$$\n\nThe second task is to identify the experimental design condition that guarantees $2\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)=0$. The term $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)$ is the genotype-environment covariance. It is non-zero if particular genotypes are systematically associated with particular environments. For instance, if genotypes with higher potential yields (higher $G$) are preferentially placed in more fertile environments (higher $E$), $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)$ will be positive. To ensure $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)=0$, any such systematic association must be eliminated. The fundamental principle of experimental design that accomplishes this is **randomization**. In the context of studying norms of reaction, this requires that individuals representing the different genotypes (or clones) are randomly allocated across the full range of experimental environments. If every genotype has an equal probability of being raised in any given environment, then the genetic and environmental effects are by construction statistically independent, and their covariance will be zero. Common garden experiments, where different genotypes are grown together in a set of environments, must employ such a randomization protocol to eliminate this covariance.\n\nThe third task is a numerical calculation. We are given a common garden experiment with \"full randomization of genotypes across environments.\" Based on the reasoning for the second task, this design ensures that $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E) = 0$. The expression for $V_P$ thus simplifies to:\n$$\nV_P = V_G + V_E + V_{G\\times E} + V_{G\\times G} + V_{\\epsilon}\n$$\nWe are provided with the following numerical values for the variance components: $V_G = 2.4$, $V_E = 1.3$, $V_{G\\times E} = 0.8$, $V_{G\\times G} = 0.5$, and $V_{\\epsilon} = 0.6$. Substituting these values into the simplified equation gives:\n$$\nV_P = 2.4 + 1.3 + 0.8 + 0.5 + 0.6\n$$\nPerforming the summation:\n$$\nV_P = (2.4 + 1.3) + (0.8 + 0.5) + 0.6 = 3.7 + 1.3 + 0.6 = 5.0 + 0.6 = 5.6\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
