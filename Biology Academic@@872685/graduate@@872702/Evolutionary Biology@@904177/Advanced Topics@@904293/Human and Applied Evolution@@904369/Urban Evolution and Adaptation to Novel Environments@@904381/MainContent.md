## Introduction
The rapid expansion of cities across the globe has transformed ecosystems, creating novel environments that challenge wildlife in unprecedented ways. Beyond simply displacing species, urban landscapes are now recognized as powerful arenas for [contemporary evolution](@entry_id:181764), where organisms adapt to new pressures over ecological timescales. This article addresses the fundamental question of how wildlife evolves in response to urbanization, a process with profound implications for biodiversity, conservation, and human-wildlife coexistence. We will explore the swift and often repeatable evolutionary changes occurring in the world's cities, moving from theoretical foundations to practical applications.

This exploration is divided into three main sections. First, the **Principles and Mechanisms** chapter will lay the groundwork, dissecting the unique selective pressures of urban environments and the genetic processes, such as selection on [standing genetic variation](@entry_id:163933) and the role of [phenotypic plasticity](@entry_id:149746), that enable rapid adaptation. Next, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will demonstrate the real-world relevance of these concepts by examining how [urban evolution](@entry_id:167306) impacts [sensory ecology](@entry_id:187871), [ecotoxicology](@entry_id:190462), thermal physiology, and conservation strategies. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers practical exercises in demographic modeling, selection analysis, and genomics, allowing for a deeper, applied understanding of the methods used to study [urban evolution](@entry_id:167306). Together, these chapters provide a comprehensive overview of urban adaptation, from its genetic underpinnings to its role in shaping the future of urban ecosystems.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The colonization of cities by wildlife represents a vast, unplanned experiment in evolution. As organisms encounter urban settings, they are subjected to a suite of environmental pressures that are profoundly different from those experienced in their ancestral habitats. This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms that govern evolutionary responses to these novel urban challenges. We will dissect the nature of the urban selective landscape, explore the methodologies for detecting evolutionary change, examine the genetic underpinnings of rapid adaptation, and discuss the complex patterns and feedbacks that emerge from these dynamic interactions.

### The Urban Environment as a Novel Selective Landscape

To understand [urban evolution](@entry_id:167306), we must first characterize the urban environment as an evolutionary arena. The defining feature of urban ecosystems is their **environmental novelty**. This novelty, however, is not merely a matter of linear intensification of familiar environmental variables, such as higher average temperatures. Rather, it is a complex, multivariate phenomenon characterized by conditions that lie outside the **Historical Range of Variation (HRV)** to which a species' lineage has been adapted [@problem_id:2761425]. Novelty can manifest across multiple dimensions:

*   **Compositional Novelty**: Urban environments introduce stimuli with entirely new physical or chemical properties. For instance, the nocturnal soundscape of a pre-industrial forest might consist of broadband, low-frequency sounds from wind and water, punctuated by brief, episodic events like thunder. In contrast, urban traffic produces sustained noise in a mid-to-high frequency band ($f \in [1,4]$ kHz) that directly masks the acoustic signals of many species. Similarly, natural nocturnal light from the moon and stars is of low intensity and spectrally broad, whereas artificial light at night (ALAN) from sources like LED streetlights is often orders of magnitude brighter and has a narrow, blue-rich spectral peak ($\lambda \approx 450$ nm) with no historical analogue [@problem_id:2761425].

*   **Phenological Novelty**: The timing of environmental cues and events is fundamentally altered. ALAN, for example, creates a state of perpetual twilight, [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) the light environment from the natural diel cycle. This disrupts chronobiological systems that have evolved over millennia to rely on predictable light-dark transitions.

*   **Covariance Novelty**: Urbanization creates new statistical relationships among environmental variables. In natural systems, the co-occurrence of certain chemical stressors, such as dissolved heavy metals and [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons](@entry_id:194624) (PAHs), might be rare. Urban stormwater runoff, however, can create novel toxicological cocktails where these compounds appear in reliable, positively correlated pulses, presenting a detoxification challenge that an organism's metabolic system has never before faced [@problem_id:2761425].

These novel features collectively define the **urban selective landscape**—a multi-dimensional surface where the fitness of an organism is a function of its traits in the urban context. This landscape is distinct not only from natural habitats but also from other anthropogenic environments like intensive agriculture. Consider, for example, a passerine bird colonizing an urban core versus an agricultural matrix. The urban environment is characterized by intense ALAN, pervasive low-frequency noise, high impervious surface cover, extreme [habitat fragmentation](@entry_id:143498), and frequent, non-lethal encounters with humans, alongside reduced pressure from natural apex predators. In contrast, an agricultural landscape may have lower ALAN and noise levels but features larger, more contiguous habitat patches and potentially different [predation](@entry_id:142212) pressures [@problem_id:2761432].

These environmental differences translate directly into differing **selection pressures** on organismal traits. For a bird, the urban acoustic environment selects for higher-frequency songs to avoid masking by traffic noise. ALAN selects for earlier onset of daily activities by advancing perceived dawn. The combination of reduced [predation](@entry_id:142212) and frequent human habituation selects for increased boldness, measurable as a shorter **[flight initiation distance](@entry_id:203148)**. Each of these represents a directional pull on the population's mean phenotype, driving adaptation to the specific challenges and opportunities of city life [@problem_id:2761432].

### Disentangling Signatures of Change: Evolution, Plasticity, and Demography

Observing a phenotypic change in an urban population over time—such as an increase in bill length or a shift in breeding dates—is only the first step. Attributing this change to evolution requires careful methodology to distinguish it from two other powerful, non-evolutionary processes: phenotypic plasticity and demographic shifts [@problem_id:2761439].

**Contemporary evolution** is defined as a heritable, genetically based change in a population occurring over ecological timescales, typically within a few to tens of generations. For an observed phenotypic trend to be robustly classified as evolution, a stringent set of criteria must be met:

1.  **Rule out Phenotypic Plasticity**: **Phenotypic plasticity** is the ability of a single genotype to express different phenotypes in response to different environmental cues. For instance, urban birds might develop longer bills simply because the novel urban diet induces a different developmental trajectory. The gold-standard method for isolating genetic effects from plasticity is the **common-garden experiment**. Offspring from urban and non-urban populations are raised under identical, controlled conditions. If the phenotypic difference observed in the wild persists in the common environment, it provides strong evidence for a genetic basis. If the difference disappears, plasticity is the more parsimonious explanation.

2.  **Demonstrate a Heritable Basis**: For a trait to evolve by natural selection, it must be heritable. This means that a portion of the [phenotypic variation](@entry_id:163153) in the population must be due to variation in the additive effects of genes. Quantitatively, the **[additive genetic variance](@entry_id:154158) ($V_A$)**, and thus the **[narrow-sense heritability](@entry_id:262760) ($h^2 = V_A / V_P$)**, must be significantly greater than zero. Heritability can be estimated by analyzing the resemblance between relatives using pedigrees or by leveraging genome-wide relatedness information.

3.  **Account for Demographic Artifacts**: A change in the population's mean phenotype can also arise from shifts in its composition. For example, if bill length increases with age, a severe weather event that disproportionately kills juveniles could increase the average age of the population, thereby increasing the mean bill length without any individual change or evolution occurring. Similarly, if long-billed individuals preferentially immigrate into the city, the mean bill length will increase due to this biased gene flow, not in-situ evolution. A rigorous study must therefore statistically account for such potential confounders, including age structure, sex ratios, and migration patterns [@problem_id:2761439].

4.  **Document Genetic Change**: The most direct [evidence for evolution](@entry_id:139293) is to observe changes in [allele frequencies](@entry_id:165920) over time. Modern **temporal genomics**, which involves sequencing individuals from a population at multiple time points, allows researchers to track allele frequency trajectories. By comparing observed changes to the expectations under [genetic drift](@entry_id:145594) alone, one can identify loci where allele frequencies have shifted in a manner consistent with selection.

Only when these lines of evidence converge can a confident claim of contemporary [urban evolution](@entry_id:167306) be made.

### The Dynamic Role of Plasticity in Urban Adaptation

While plasticity can be a [confounding](@entry_id:260626) factor in studies of evolution, it is also a critical mechanism that can facilitate [adaptation to novel environments](@entry_id:191502). The relationship between an organism's phenotype and the environment is described by its **[reaction norm](@entry_id:175812)**. For a given genotype, the reaction norm is a function that maps a continuous environmental variable, $E$, to a corresponding phenotype, $z$. In a simple linear model, this can be expressed as $z = a + bE$, where $a$ is the intercept (the phenotype in environment $E=0$) and $b$ is the slope, which quantifies the magnitude and direction of the plastic response [@problem_id:2761340].

Crucially, both the intercept and the slope of a reaction norm can themselves be heritable traits. A more complete quantitative genetic model for the phenotype ($z_{ij}$) of an individual from family $i$ in environment $j$ is:
$z_{ij} = g_{0i} + g_{1i} E_{j} + \epsilon_{ij}$

Here, $g_{0i}$ is the additive genetic value ([breeding value](@entry_id:196154)) for the intercept, and $g_{1i}$ is the [breeding value](@entry_id:196154) for the slope (plasticity). The existence of genetic variation for both the intercept ($V_{A(g_0)} > 0$) and the slope ($V_{A(g_1)} > 0$) means that natural selection can shape the entire [reaction norm](@entry_id:175812). This [evolution of plasticity](@entry_id:191890) is termed **[genetic accommodation](@entry_id:173068)**.

Plasticity can play a pivotal role in the initial stages of colonization. An immediate, adaptive plastic response can allow a population to persist in a novel urban environment, preventing extinction and giving natural selection time to act on the underlying genetic variation. For example, an innate capacity to increase heat tolerance in response to higher temperatures may be essential for survival during an urban heatwave. Over subsequent generations, selection can act to refine this response. It might favor genotypes with a higher baseline tolerance (an upward shift in the reaction norm intercept, or **[genetic adaptation](@entry_id:151805)**), or it might alter the sensitivity to the environment (a change in the slope). In a highly predictable urban environment, selection may even favor a reduction in plasticity, leading to a constitutively expressed, high-tolerance phenotype. This loss of plasticity is a special case of [genetic accommodation](@entry_id:173068) known as **[genetic assimilation](@entry_id:164594)** [@problem_id:2761340].

### The Genetic Architecture of Rapid Adaptation

The remarkable speed of evolution in many urban species is a testament to the power of selection, but it also depends critically on the available genetic raw material and the influence of stochastic forces.

#### Stochastic Processes: Drift, Bottlenecks, and Founder Effects

Urban colonization is often initiated by a small number of individuals, making populations susceptible to stochastic changes in allele frequencies, a process known as **genetic drift**. The initial colonization event itself is a **[founder effect](@entry_id:146976)**, a type of genetic **bottleneck** where the founding group contains only a subset of the genetic diversity present in the large source population. As cities expand and become fragmented by roads and buildings, populations can become subdivided into small, isolated patches with limited gene flow. This fragmentation further enhances the power of drift within each patch, leading to a loss of [genetic variation](@entry_id:141964) (e.g., heterozygosity and [allelic richness](@entry_id:198623)) and increased [genetic differentiation](@entry_id:163113) among patches (measured by statistics like the **Fixation Index, $F_{ST}$**) [@problem_id:2761514].

A critical concept here is the distinction between **[census size](@entry_id:173208) ($N_c$)**, the simple count of individuals, and **effective population size ($N_e$)**, the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of drift. In many urban species, factors like highly skewed [reproductive success](@entry_id:166712)—where a few individuals produce a large proportion of the offspring—can cause the effective population size to be far smaller than the [census size](@entry_id:173208) ($N_e \ll N_c$). This explains why even seemingly large urban populations can show strong genetic signatures of drift [@problem_id:2761514]. In some cases, drift during spatial expansion can even create geographic patterns in allele frequencies, a phenomenon known as **gene surfing**, which can mimic the signature of selection [@problem_id:2761514].

#### The Primacy of Standing Genetic Variation

While new beneficial mutations (**de novo mutations**) are the ultimate source of all adaptation, the waiting time for a specific beneficial mutation to arise and establish can be long. Rapid adaptation to urban environments is therefore more often fueled by selection acting on **[standing genetic variation](@entry_id:163933) (SGV)**—the pool of alleles already segregating in the population before the environmental shift [@problem_id:2761330]. This pre-existing variation may have been neutral or even mildly deleterious in the ancestral environment but becomes advantageous under urban selection pressures.

Adaptation from SGV is typically much faster than adaptation from a new mutation for two reasons. First, it bypasses the waiting time for the mutation to occur. Second, the beneficial allele is often already present at a low frequency in many individuals, allowing selection to increase its frequency immediately. When a single [de novo mutation](@entry_id:270419) is the source of adaptation, it creates a **[hard selective sweep](@entry_id:187838)**, where the beneficial allele and a long, linked block of the genome rise to high frequency, purging variation in the surrounding region. In contrast, when adaptation proceeds from SGV, the beneficial allele often exists on multiple different genetic backgrounds (haplotypes). Selection increases the frequency of all these haplotypes simultaneously, creating a **[soft selective sweep](@entry_id:204200)**. Soft sweeps preserve more genetic variation and leave a more subtle genomic footprint, a pattern frequently observed in urban-adapted populations [@problem_id:2761330]. For highly **[polygenic traits](@entry_id:272105)**, where many genes of small effect contribute to the phenotype, adaptation from SGV can be even more rapid, involving small, coordinated allele frequency shifts at numerous loci across the genome.

### Quantifying Selection and Its Constraints

To move from qualitative descriptions to a predictive science, [urban evolution](@entry_id:167306) relies on the framework of evolutionary quantitative genetics to measure selection and understand the constraints that shape adaptive outcomes.

#### Measuring Selection in the Wild

Selection acts on phenotypes, but its evolutionary consequences depend on the underlying genetics. Two key metrics, the **[selection differential](@entry_id:276336) ($S$)** and the **[selection gradient](@entry_id:152595) ($\beta$)**, allow us to dissect this process [@problem_id:2761471].

An individual's **lifetime [reproductive success](@entry_id:166712)** is the ultimate currency of fitness and is often modeled as a multiplicative product of sequential fitness components, such as survival to maturity and subsequent [fecundity](@entry_id:181291). The **[selection differential](@entry_id:276336) ($S$)** measures the total, all-inclusive change in a trait's mean within a single generation caused by selection. It is calculated as the difference between the mean phenotype of selected individuals (e.g., survivors) and the mean of the entire population before selection. Equivalently, it is equal to the covariance between the trait and [relative fitness](@entry_id:153028) ($S = \text{cov}(z, \tilde{w})$).

However, $S$ can be misleading, as a trait might change not because it is directly under selection, but because it is phenotypically correlated with another trait that is. The **[selection gradient](@entry_id:152595) ($\beta$)** remedies this by measuring the direct force of [directional selection](@entry_id:136267) on a trait, statistically controlling for correlations with other measured traits. In a multivariate context, the vector of selection gradients ($\boldsymbol{\beta}$) is found by the [multiple regression](@entry_id:144007) of [relative fitness](@entry_id:153028) on all traits. These two metrics are linked by the equation $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{P}\boldsymbol{\beta}$, where $\mathbf{P}$ is the [phenotypic variance](@entry_id:274482)-covariance matrix of the traits [@problem_id:2761471].

The true power of the [selection gradient](@entry_id:152595) is revealed in predicting the evolutionary response across generations. The **[multivariate breeder's equation](@entry_id:186980)**, $\Delta \bar{\mathbf{z}} = \mathbf{G}\boldsymbol{\beta}$, connects the [response to selection](@entry_id:267049) ($\Delta \bar{\mathbf{z}}$) to the direct forces of selection ($\boldsymbol{\beta}$) via the **[additive genetic variance-covariance matrix](@entry_id:198875) ($\mathbf{G}$)**. This equation is the cornerstone of predicting short-term evolution [@problem_id:2761471].

#### Evolutionary Constraints and Trade-offs

Populations do not evolve toward perfection. Their path of adaptation is channeled and limited by [evolutionary constraints](@entry_id:152522). A major source of constraint is the existence of **trade-offs**, where an evolutionary change that improves one trait or fitness component comes at the cost of another.

These trade-offs are often rooted in the [genetic architecture](@entry_id:151576) of traits. **Antagonistic [pleiotropy](@entry_id:139522)** occurs when a single gene has opposing effects on two different traits. When many such genes exist, they create a negative **[genetic correlation](@entry_id:176283) ($r_g$)** between the traits, meaning that alleles that increase one trait tend to decrease the other. This is captured by the off-diagonal elements of the $\mathbf{G}$ matrix.

The evolutionary response depends on the interplay between selection ($\boldsymbol{\beta}$) and the [genetic architecture](@entry_id:151576) ($\mathbf{G}$). For instance, consider an urban bird where selection favors both higher noise tolerance ($z_1$) and greater predator detection sensitivity ($z_2$). If there is a negative [genetic correlation](@entry_id:176283) between these traits ($G_{12}  0$), perhaps because the neural mechanisms for filtering noise also filter out weak predator cues, the evolutionary outcome can be counterintuitive. Strong selection for noise tolerance ($\beta_1 > 0$) will cause an indirect, negative response in predator sensitivity due to the term $G_{21}\beta_1$. If this negative correlated response is stronger than the positive direct response from selection on sensitivity itself ($G_{22}\beta_2$), the population's mean predator sensitivity can actually evolve to decrease, even though it is directly favored by selection [@problem_id:2761517]. The evolutionary trajectory is thus a tug-of-war between what selection "wants" and what the [genetic architecture](@entry_id:151576) "allows."

### Patterns and Feedbacks in Urban Evolution

When we zoom out from single populations, we can observe larger-scale patterns of repeatability and complexity in urban adaptation.

#### Parallelism and Convergence in Urban Landscapes

Given that cities across the globe impose similar selection pressures, we might expect to see repeated, or parallel, evolution. **Parallel evolution** is the independent evolution of similar traits in related lineages, starting from a similar ancestral state. This is distinct from **convergent evolution**, which describes the evolution of similar traits from very different ancestral starting points. Because most urban colonizers come from nearby, related non-urban populations, patterns of repeated adaptation in cities are typically classified as [parallel evolution](@entry_id:263490) [@problem_id:2761640].

Phenotypic parallelism appears to be common; for example, lizards in multiple cities have independently evolved similar changes in limb length and toe pad morphology to cope with navigating smooth, vertical surfaces. However, the genetic basis of this parallelism can be surprisingly varied. Studies have revealed a hierarchy of repeatability:

*   **Allele-level parallelism**: The exact same beneficial allele or haplotype is selected in independent populations.
*   **Gene-level [parallelism](@entry_id:753103)**: Different alleles within the same gene are selected.
*   **Pathway-level [parallelism](@entry_id:753103)**: Different genes within the same physiological or developmental pathway are targeted by selection.

It is common to find a mixed mode, where some cities adapt via the same gene, while others achieve the same phenotypic outcome by modifying different genes in the same functional pathway [@problem_id:2761640]. This "many-to-one" mapping from [genotype to phenotype](@entry_id:268683) highlights both the predictability of adaptation at the phenotypic level and the creative contingency of evolution at the genetic level.

#### Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks

Finally, it is crucial to recognize that evolution is not a one-way process where the environment acts on a population. Evolving populations can, in turn, modify their environment, creating **[eco-evolutionary feedbacks](@entry_id:203772)**. This is a coupled dynamic where evolved traits alter ecological conditions, and those altered ecological conditions then alter the selection pressures on the very same traits [@problem_id:2761373].

Consider the evolution of boldness in an urban animal. An increase in [population mean](@entry_id:175446) boldness ($\bar{b}$) might initially lead to more positive human-wildlife interactions, increasing the availability of provisioned food, $H(\bar{b})$. This creates a positive feedback, strengthening selection for even greater boldness. However, beyond a certain point, very high levels of boldness may lead to increased [human-wildlife conflict](@entry_id:197931), causing residents or managers to reduce food provisioning. This creates a [negative feedback](@entry_id:138619): the ecological change (reduced food) now weakens selection for boldness, or may even select against it. This dynamic can lead to the stabilization of the trait at an intermediate level, where the positive and negative eco-[evolutionary forces](@entry_id:273961) are balanced. Such feedbacks reveal that the selective landscape is not static but can be molded by the evolutionary trajectory of the population itself, adding a rich layer of complexity to the study of urban adaptation [@problem_id:2761373].
