It is scientifically grounded in quantitative genetics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. No logical contradictions, factual inaccuracies, or other invalidating flaws are present. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe central task is to derive and compute the selection differential, $S$, which is defined as the covariance between the trait value, $z$, and the relative fitness, $w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)$.\n$$\nS = \\operatorname{cov}(z, w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z))\n$$\nBy definition, the covariance of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is $\\operatorname{cov}(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$. Applying this to our context gives:\n$$\nS = E[z \\cdot w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)] - E[z] \\cdot E[w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)]\n$$\nWe evaluate each term in this expression.\n$E[z]$ is the mean of the trait $z$ in the population *before* selection. The problem states that the pre-selection distribution of $z$ is normal with mean $\\mu$. Thus, $E[z] = \\mu$.\n\n$E[w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)]$ is the mean relative fitness in the population. The relative fitness is defined as $w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z) = w(z) / \\overline{w}$, where $\\overline{w}$ is the population mean absolute fitness, i.e., $\\overline{w} = E[w(z)]$. The expectation of the relative fitness is therefore:\n$$\nE[w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)] = E\\left[\\frac{w(z)}{\\overline{w}}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\overline{w}} E[w(z)] = \\frac{1}{\\overline{w}} \\cdot \\overline{w} = 1\n$$\nThis is a definitional property of relative fitness.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = E[z \\cdot w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)] - \\mu \\cdot 1 = E[z \\cdot w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)] - \\mu\n$$\nThe term $E[z \\cdot w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)]$ represents the mean trait value in the population *after* selection, which we can denote as $\\mu'$. This is because it is the expectation of $z$ weighted by the relative fitness of each phenotype. The post-selection distribution of the trait is $p'(z) = p(z) w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)$, and $\\mu' = \\int z p'(z) dz = E[z \\cdot w_{\\mathrm{rel}}(z)]$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for $\\alpha$, the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions fixed by positive selection. The foundation of this derivation is the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, which posits that under strict neutrality, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes should be equivalent for both polymorphism within a species and divergence between species.\n\nLet $D_{\\mathrm{n}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{s}}$ be the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous fixed differences between species, respectively. Let $P_{\\mathrm{n}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{s}}$ be the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphic sites within a species, respectively.\n\nThe total number of observed nonsynonymous fixations, $D_{\\mathrm{n}}$, is the sum of those fixed by positive selection (adaptive substitutions), which we denote $D_{\\mathrm{na}}$, and those fixed by neutral processes like genetic drift, denoted $D_{\\mathrm{nn}}$.\n$$D_{\\mathrm{n}} = D_{\\mathrm{na}} + D_{\\mathrm{nn}}$$\nBy definition, $\\alpha$ is the fraction of nonsynonymous divergence driven by adaptive evolution:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{na}}}{D_{\\mathrm{n}}}$$\nTo estimate $\\alpha$, we must first estimate the number of nonsynonymous substitutions that would be expected to become fixed under neutrality, $D_{\\mathrm{nn}}$. The core assumption of the McDonald–Kreitman framework is that synonymous mutations are neutral, and thus the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms, $\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{n}}}{P_{\\mathrm{s}}}$, reflects the proportion of nonsynonymous mutations that are effectively neutral. If nonsynonymous mutations were also strictly neutral, the ratio of neutral nonsynonymous divergence to synonymous divergence, $\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{nn}}}{D_{\\mathrm{s}}}$, would be equal to the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism.\n$$\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{nn}}}{D_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{n}}}{P_{\\mathrm{s}}}$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the expected number of neutrally fixed nonsynonymous substitutions in terms of the observable quantities:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{nn}} = D_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{n}}}{P_{\\mathrm{s}}}$$\nThe number of adaptively fixed nonsynonymous substitutions, $D_{\\mathrm{na}}$, is then the total observed number, $D_{\\mathrm{n}}$, minus the expected neutral component, $D_{\\mathrm{nn}}$.\n$$D_{\\mathrm{na}} = D_{\\mathrm{n}} - D_{\\mathrm{nn}} = D_{\\mathrm{n}} - D_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{n}}}{P_{\\mathrm{s}}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $D_{\\mathrm{na}}$ into the definition of $\\alpha$ yields the final form for calculation:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{n}} - D_{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{n}}}{P_{\\mathrm{s}}}}{D_{\\mathrm{n}}}$$\nThis expression can be simplified to:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{s}}}{D_{\\mathrm{n}}} \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{n}}}{P_{\\mathrm{s}}}$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of the given variables.\n\nThe second task is to compute the value of $\\alpha$ using the provided data for the $TLR1$ gene: $P_{\\mathrm{n}} = 26$, $P_{\\mathrm{s}} = 25$, $D_{\\mathrm{n}} = 24$, and $D_{\\mathrm{s}} = 30$.\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\left(\\frac{30}{24}\\right) \\left(\\frac{26}{25}\\right)$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{26}{25}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{5 \\times 26}{4 \\times 25} = 1 - \\frac{130}{100}$$\n$$\\alpha = 1 - 1.3 = -0.3$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

This is the classic signature of positive selection driving adaptive substitutions to fixation.\nA negative value of $\\alpha$, as we have found here, signifies that $\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{n}}}{D_{\\mathrm{s}}} < \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{n}}}{P_{\\mathrm{s}}}$. For our data, $\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{n}}}{D_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\frac{24}{30} = 0.8$, while $\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{n}}}{P_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\frac{26}{25} = 1.04$. The inequality $0.8 < 1.04$ holds. This indicates a relative excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms within the human population compared to nonsynonymous fixed differences between humans and chimpanzees.\nThis pattern is most commonly interpreted as evidence for the presence of a substantial class of slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations. These mutations are subject to purifying (negative) selection, which prevents most of them from becoming fixed, but they can persist at low frequencies as polymorphisms within the population for some time before being eliminated. This inflates the $P_{\\mathrm{n}}$ term relative to the $D_{\\mathrm{n}}$ term. An alternative, though generally less common, explanation could be long-standing balancing selection, which actively maintains certain alleles in a polymorphic state. Therefore, the negative sign of $\\alpha$ is more consistent with an excess of segregating nonsynonymous variation, likely due to the presence of slightly deleterious alleles under purifying selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.3000}$$", "id": "2708957"}, {"introduction": "Many human-specific traits are not governed by single genes but are polygenic, complicating the search for selection.

If the phenotype is standardized ($V_P = 1$) and the interrogated SNPs contribute $h^2_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ of variance, then $V_A = h^2_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ for those SNPs in the target population.\n\nAssume that all standard regression diagnostics have been run and that the reported $R^2$ values are unbiased estimates in the respective target samples. The team argues that the positive $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}}$ reflects selection increasing cognitive ability in $\\mathcal{A}$ relative to $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct in evaluating the evidentiary status of this claim, given the data and the foundational relationships above?

The LDSC attenuation ratio $R_{\\mathrm{att}} = \\frac{I - 1}{\\bar{\\chi}^2 - 1}$ shows that at most a small fraction of inflation is due to confounding; with $R_{\\mathrm{att}}$ near $0.13$, the mean PGS difference $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}} = 0.25$ cannot plausibly arise from confounding aligned with ancestry.\n\nB. Using $F_{ST} = 0.12$ and $h^2_{\\mathrm{cap}} \\approx R^2_{\\mathcal{A}} = 0.08$ as the captured additive variance, the neutral standard deviation of PGS differences is $\\sqrt{2 F_{ST} h^2_{\\mathrm{cap}}} \\approx 0.14$. The observed $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}} = 0.25$ is thus only about $1.8$ standard deviations from neutral expectation and, by itself, does not meet a conservative genome-wide standard for rejecting neutrality.\n\nC. Because portability to $\\mathcal{B}$ is low, the cross-population PGS difference necessarily underestimates the true genetic divergence by a factor close to $\\sqrt{R^2_{\\mathcal{B}} / R^2_{\\mathcal{A}}}$, so $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}} = 0.25$ likely understates selection.\n\nD.

It presents a realistic, scientifically grounded scenario that requires a rigorous application of quantitative and population genetics principles. I will proceed with the analysis of each option.\n\nAnalysis of the Proposed Statements\n\nThe central claim made by the fictitious research team is that an observed difference in mean Polygenic Score ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}} = 0.25$) between a European-ancestry population ($\\mathcal{A}$) and an African-ancestry population ($\\mathcal{B}$) constitutes evidence for recent selection. This is a strong claim that requires careful scrutiny, as mean PGS differences between divergent populations are notoriously susceptible to confounding by population structure.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A**\n\nThis statement computes the LDSC attenuation ratio, $R_{\\mathrm{att}} = \\frac{I - 1}{\\bar{\\chi}^2 - 1}$, which purports to quantify the fraction of test statistic inflation due to confounding.\nThe calculation is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{att}} = \\frac{1.08 - 1}{1.60 - 1} = \\frac{0.08}{0.60} = \\frac{8}{60} = \\frac{2}{15} \\approx 0.133$$\nThe calculation is arithmetically correct. The interpretation, however, is deeply flawed. The LDSC model partitions inflation into a component that is correlated with LD score (ascribed to polygenicity) and a component that is not (ascribed to confounding like cryptic relatedness and population stratification, captured by the intercept $I$). The fundamental assumption is that confounding is *not* correlated with LD score. If this assumption is violated—for instance, by fine-scale stratification that itself covaries with regional LD patterns—then confounding effects will bleed into the slope of the LDSC regression. This contaminates the GWAS SNP effect-size estimates ($\\hat{\\beta}_j$) that are used to build the PGS. A PGS constructed from such biased estimates will inherently track ancestry, creating a mean PGS difference between populations even in the complete absence of any true genetic difference for the trait. Therefore, a modest LDSC intercept does not, and cannot, guarantee that the PGS is free from the effects of stratification. The conclusion that this small ratio implies that confounding cannot explain the observed $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}}$ is a dangerous non sequitur.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Evaluation of Option B**\n\nThis statement evaluates the observed PGS difference against the null hypothesis of neutral genetic drift. Under neutrality, the expected variance of the difference in the mean true genetic value ($G$) between two populations is given as $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta G) \\approx 2 F_{ST} V_A$. The statement uses the heritability captured by the PGS in the well-matched European population, $h^2_{\\mathrm{cap}} \\approx R^2_{\\mathcal{A}} = 0.08$, as a proxy for the additive variance $V_A$ contributed by the SNPs. This is a reasonable first approximation.\nThe expected standard deviation of the difference under neutrality is then:\n$$\\sigma_{\\Delta G, \\text{neutral}} = \\sqrt{2 F_{ST} V_A} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.08} = \\sqrt{0.0192} \\approx 0.1386$$\nThe statement correctly approximates this value as $0.14$.\nNext, it compares the observed difference, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}} = 0.25$, to this neutral expectation. The deviation is measured in units of neutral standard deviations (a Z-score):\n$$Z = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}}}{\\sigma_{\\Delta G, \\text{neutral}}} \\approx \\frac{0.25}{0.14} \\approx 1.79$$\nThe statement correctly approximates this as \"$1.8$ standard deviations\". A deviation of this magnitude is not statistically significant by any conventional standard in genomics (e.g., $p \\approx 0.07$ for a two-tailed test), which would require a much larger magnitude to confidently reject the null hypothesis of neutrality. While using $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}}$ as a direct proxy for $\\Delta G$ is problematic, this calculation correctly demonstrates that even taken at face value, the observed difference is within the range that could be plausibly generated by genetic drift alone.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Evaluation of Option C**\n\nThis statement addresses the poor portability of the PGS to population $\\mathcal{B}$ (where $R^2_{\\mathcal{B}} = 0.02$, a quarter of the value in $\\mathcal{A}$). It claims this low portability implies that the observed $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}}$ *underestimates* the true genetic difference, suggesting the real effect of selection is even larger.\nThis reasoning is fallacious. Low portability arises from differences in LD structure, allele frequencies, and possibly gene-by-environment interactions between the discovery population (European) and the target population (African). This means the SNP weights ($\\hat{\\beta}_j$) derived from the European GWAS are poor predictors of an individual's genetic value in the African-ancestry sample. The relationship between the PGS and the true genetic value is weak and, more importantly, can be biased. The mean PGS difference is driven by the sum $\\sum_j \\hat{\\beta}_j (\\bar{p}_{\\mathcal{A},j} - \\bar{p}_{\\mathcal{B},j})$, where $\\bar{p}$ are mean allele frequencies. Uncontrolled stratification in the GWAS can create spurious correlations between $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ and allele frequency differences that are driven by neutral drift. This can inflate $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}}$ dramatically, making it an *overestimate*—not an underestimate—of the true genetic difference, which may well be zero. The argument of an underestimation factor of $\\sqrt{R^2_{\\mathcal{B}} / R^2_{\\mathcal{A}}} = 0.5$ is spurious and lacks theoretical justification in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Evaluation of Option D**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies a primary limitation of using LDSC to \"clear\" a GWAS of confounding. It explicitly states that relying solely on the intercept is unsafe. It proposes a valid mechanism: if environmental or social stratification covaries with patterns of LD (which can happen if ancestry itself correlates with LD structure), the core assumption of LDSC is violated. This \"LD-dependent confounding\" is absorbed by the slope term of the regression, thus biasing the SNP effect estimates ($\\hat{\\beta}_j$). A PGS constructed from these biased estimates will act as a proxy for the very fine-scale ancestry that was not controlled for. When such a PGS is applied to populations that are highly diverged along this axis of ancestry (like European and African populations), the resulting difference in mean PGS, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}}$, is expected to be large and primarily reflect this demographic confounding, not a true difference in the genetic basis of the trait. This statement offers a precise and accurate critique of the naive interpretation presented in option A.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Evaluation of Option E**\n\nThis statement outlines the principles of a statistically rigorous test for polygenic selection. It correctly states that a proper test should compare a statistic summarizing polygenic differentiation (like $(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PGS}})^2$) not to a naive null distribution (e.g., from simple permutation), but to a carefully constructed neutral expectation. This expectation must be conditioned on the known genomic background of the populations involved. The key elements it mentions are correct:\n1.  **Genome-wide $F_{ST}$ structure**: The null model must account for the actual correlation of allele frequencies between populations due to their shared history and subsequent drift.\n2.  **Effect-size covariance across SNPs**: The null model must also account for the fact that SNP effects are not independent due to Linkage Disequilibrium (LD).\nIgnoring these factors, as a simple permutation test would, is known to be \"anti-conservative,\" meaning it generates an excess of false positives, because it fails to account for the background differentiation caused by neutral drift in the presence of LD. The reference to a \"$Q_X$-type framework\" correctly points to the modern class of statistical methods (e.g., those developed by Berg, Coop, and others) designed precisely for this purpose. These methods formalize the comparison of observed polygenic score differentiation against a null model incorporating population structure and LD, providing a much more robust test for selection than the naive approaches.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "2708923"}]}
