It is scientifically grounded in established principles of statistical mechanics and information theory as applied to molecular biology. The definitions are precise, the assumptions are standard in the field, and the question is well-posed, admitting a unique, derivable solution. All necessary components for the derivation are provided and are mutually consistent.\n\nThe solution is derived in two parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the log-likelihood ratio score for a sequence $s = (b_{1}, \\dots, b_{L})$. The log-likelihood ratio, which we denote as $\\text{LLR}(s)$, is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the probability of the sequence under the motif model to its probability under the background model.\n$$\n\\text{LLR}(s) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(s | \\text{motif})}{P(s | \\text{background})}\\right)\n$$\nUnder the assumption of positional independence, the probability of sequence $s$ given the motif model (represented by the position weight matrix, PWM) is the product of the probabilities of the constituent bases at each position.\n$$\nP(s | \\text{motif}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{L} p_{i, b_i}\n$$\nwhere $p_{i, b_i}$ is the probability of base $b_i$ at position $i$ in the PWM. Similarly, the probability of sequence $s$ under the independent background model is the product of the background frequencies of its bases.\n$$\nP(s | \\text{background}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{L} q_{b_i}\n$$\nwhere $q_{b_i}$ is the background frequency of base $b_i$. Substituting these expressions into the definition of the log-likelihood ratio yields:\n$$\n\\text{LLR}(s) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{L} p_{i, b_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{L} q_{b_i}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{p_{i, b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms, we obtain the final expression for the score:\n$$\n\\text{LLR}(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i, b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the standard log-odds score for a sequence.\n\nSecond, we derive the relationship between the binding energy $E(s)$ and this log-likelihood ratio score. The derivation is based on the provided assumption that the PWM probabilities $p_{i,b}$ are obtained from sequences sampled in proportion to their equilibrium occupancy, which itself is proportional to the Boltzmann weight $\\exp(-\\beta E(s))$, multiplied by their background frequency. The probability of sampling a specific sequence $s$ is therefore:\n$$\nP(\\text{sample } s) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\text{total}}} P(s | \\text{background}) \\exp(-\\beta (E(s) - \\mu))\n$$\nwhere $Z_{\\text{total}}$ is the partition function over all possible sequences, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. Substituting the additive energy model $E(s) = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\epsilon_{j,b_{j}} + C$ and the background probability, we have:\n$$\nP(\\text{sample } s) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\text{total}}} \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{L} q_{b_j}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\beta\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\epsilon_{j,b_j} + C - \\mu\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nP(\\text{sample } s) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta (C - \\mu))}{Z_{\\text{total}}} \\prod_{j=1}^{L} \\left(q_{b_j} \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{j,b_j})\\right)\n$$\nThe PWM probability $p_{i,b}$ is the marginal probability of observing base $b$ at position $i$. This is found by summing $P(\\text{sample } s)$ over all sequences $s$ where the base at position $i$ is $b$.\n$$\np_{i,b} = \\sum_{s \\text{ s.t. } b_i=b} P(\\text{sample } s)\n$$\nDue to the positional independence in the model, this summation simplifies. The total partition function $Z_{\\text{total}}$ can be factored into position-specific partition functions $Z_j = \\sum_{b' \\in \\{\\text{A,C,G,T}\\}} q_{b'} \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{j,b'})$. The full expression for $Z_{\\text{total}}$ becomes $Z_{\\text{total}} = \\exp(-\\beta (C - \\mu)) \\prod_{j=1}^{L} Z_j$. The marginalization for $p_{i,b}$ then yields a simple relation:\n$$\np_{i,b} = \\frac{q_b \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{i,b})}{Z_i}\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the ratio of the PWM probability to the background frequency:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i,b}}{q_b} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{i,b})}{Z_i}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides provides a direct link to the energy contribution:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b}}{q_b}\\right) = -\\beta \\epsilon_{i,b} - \\ln(Z_i)\n$$\nSolving for the positional energy contribution $\\epsilon_{i,b}$ gives:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{i,b} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b}}{q_b}\\right) + \\ln(Z_i)\\right)\n$$\nThe total binding energy for a sequence $s = (b_1, \\dots, b_L)$ is given by the sum of positional contributions plus a constant $C$:\n$$\nE(s) = C + \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\epsilon_{i,b_i} = C + \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right) + \\ln(Z_i)\\right)\\right]\n$$\nWe can separate the sequence-dependent and sequence-independent terms:\n$$\nE(s) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right) + \\left(C - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln(Z_i)\\right)\n$$\nThe term in parentheses, $\\left(C - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln(Z_i)\\right)$, is independent of the sequence $s$. It combines the sequence-independent part of the energy model, $C$, and the normalization constants $Z_i$. As per the problem, we define a single additive constant $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ to absorb all such sequence-independent terms. Thus, we set:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ref}} = C - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln(Z_i)\n$$\nThe final expression for the binding energy $E(s)$ is:\n$$\nE(s) = E_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression connects the binding energy directly to the log-likelihood score of the sequence, the inverse temperature, and a reference energy, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b_{i}}}{q_{b_{i}}}\\right)}$$", "id": "2570758"}, {"introduction": "Once a transcription factor binds to DNA, it alters the rate of mRNA production, forming the basic output of a regulatory interaction.

In the LNA framework for a one-dimensional birth-death process, the steady-state variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2$, is related to the linearized drift and the total noise intensity at the steady state. The drift towards the steady state is governed by the linearization of the net rate function $f(x) = a_{+}(x) - a_{-}(x)$ around $x=M$. The effective relaxation rate of fluctuations is $\\lambda = -f'(M)$, where $f'(M) = \\left. \\frac{df}{dx} \\right|_{x=M}$.

The variance is given by the fluctuation-dissipation relation $\\sigma^2 = \\dfrac{D(M)}{2\\lambda} = \\dfrac{a_{+}(M) + a_{-}(M)}{-2 f'(M)}$. The coefficient of variation is defined as $\\mathrm{CV} = \\dfrac{\\sigma}{M}$.\n\nWe will now apply this formalism to both systems.\n\nFor the unregulated system:\nThe net rate function is $f_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(x) = \\alpha - \\gamma x$.\nThe derivative is $f'_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(x) = -\\gamma$, which is constant. So, $f'_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(M) = -\\gamma$.\nAt steady state, $a_+(M) = \\alpha = \\gamma M$ and $a_-(M) = \\gamma M$.\nThe noise intensity is $D_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(M) = a_{+}(M) + a_{-}(M) = \\gamma M + \\gamma M = 2\\gamma M$.\nThe variance is $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(X) = \\dfrac{2\\gamma M}{-2(-\\gamma)} = M$.\nThe coefficient of variation is $\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{unreg}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(X)}}{M} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{M}}{M} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}$.\n\nFor the negatively autoregulated system:\nThe net rate function is $f_{\\mathrm{auto}}(x) = \\dfrac{k_{\\max}}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}} - \\gamma x$.\nIts derivative is $f'_{\\mathrm{auto}}(x) = k_{\\max} \\cdot (-1) \\left(1 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{nx^{n-1}}{K^n}\\right) - \\gamma = -\\dfrac{k_{\\max} n x^{n-1}}{K^n \\left(1 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^2} - \\gamma$.\nWe evaluate this at $x=M$ and substitute the expression for $k_{\\max}$:\n$f'_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M) = -\\dfrac{\\gamma M \\left(1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right) n M^{n-1}}{K^n \\left(1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^2} - \\gamma = -\\dfrac{\\gamma n M^n/K^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^{n}} - \\gamma$.\nFactoring out $-\\gamma$, we get $f'_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M) = -\\gamma \\left(1 + \\dfrac{n \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}\\right)$.\nAt steady state, $a_+(M) = a_-(M) = \\gamma M$.\nThe noise intensity is $D_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M) = a_{+}(M) + a_{-}(M) = \\gamma M + \\gamma M = 2\\gamma M$.\nThe variance is $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{auto}}(X) = \\dfrac{D_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M)}{-2 f'_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M)} = \\dfrac{2\\gamma M}{-2 \\left(-\\gamma \\left(1 + \\dfrac{n \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}\\right)\\right)} = \\dfrac{M}{1 + \\dfrac{n \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}}$.\nThe coefficient of variation is $\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{auto}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{auto}}(X)}}{M} = \\dfrac{1}{M}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{M}{1 + \\dfrac{n \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}}} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}} \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\dfrac{n\\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the fold-change in the coefficient of variation:\n$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{auto}}}{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{unreg}}} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}} \\left(1 + \\dfrac{n\\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}\\right)^{-1/2}}{\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{n\\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}\\right)^{-1/2}$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given numerical values: $M = 100$, $K = 100$, and $n = 2$.\nThe ratio $\\dfrac{M}{K} = \\dfrac{100}{100} = 1$.\nSubstituting these values into the fold-change expression:\n$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{auto}}}{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{unreg}}} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{2 \\cdot (1)^2}{1 + (1)^2}\\right)^{-1/2} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{2}{1+1}\\right)^{-1/2} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^{-1/2} = (1+1)^{-1/2} = (2)^{-1/2} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nNumerically, this value is approximately $0.70710678...$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.7071$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7071}$$", "id": "2708504"}]}
