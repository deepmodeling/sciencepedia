They suspect a nucleotide-specific failure in the terminator mix, specifically depletion of the dideoxynucleotide triphosphate (ddNTP) for guanine, dideoxyguanosine triphosphate (ddGTP). Recall the fundamental base of Sanger DNA sequencing: DNA polymerase extends a primer in the $5'$ to $3'$ direction using deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and extension is stochastically terminated when a ddNTP is incorporated, producing a nested set of fragments that differ by single nucleotides. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) resolves fragments by length and a spectrally separable fluorescent dye on each ddNTP enables base calling by dye color as fragments pass a detector. Base pairing dictates that the newly synthesized strand will incorporate guanine opposite cytosine on the template, adenine opposite thymine, cytosine opposite guanine, and thymine opposite adenine. Thus, the identity of a missing dye channel or depleted ddNTP determines a qualitative pattern of missing terminations across the entire read.\n\nDesign a single-run internal control that would reveal a dye- or nucleotide-specific failure such as ddGTP depletion, and predict the qualitative pattern expected in the electropherogram if ddGTP is indeed depleted.

It is a valid, well-constructed problem in applied molecular genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived and the options evaluated.\n\n**Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is to devise a robust strategy to diagnose the specific failure of $ddGTP$ depletion. Let us analyze the requirements and derive the ideal solution.\n\n1.  **Nature of the Failure:** Depletion of $ddGTP$ means that when the DNA polymerase encounters a cytosine ($C$) on the template strand, it cannot incorporate the terminating dideoxyguanosine. It will instead incorporate a standard deoxyguanosine triphosphate ($dGTP$) and continue synthesis until it reaches a template base for which the corresponding $ddNTP$ (e.g., $ddATP$, $ddCTP$, $ddTTP$) is available. Consequently, DNA fragments terminating at guanine ($G$) positions will not be produced, or will be produced at extremely low levels. This will result in a near-total absence of chromatogram peaks corresponding to the dye attached to $ddGTP$ (the \"guanine color\"). This effect is systemic and chemical, not related to the template sequence itself; therefore, it should manifest across the entire length of any sequence in the run.\n\n2.  **Control Design:** To test for a systemic reagent failure, the control must be a template known to sequence reliably under normal conditions. A standard, well-characterized plasmid with a known sequence and a balanced base composition is ideal. It is critical to provide ample opportunity for the suspected failure to occur; thus, the template must contain numerous cytosines ($C$) to test for $ddGTP$ incorporation. To distinguish this systemic failure from a template-specific artifact (e.g., secondary structure, polymerase slippage at a specific motif), which might affect only one strand, it is imperative to sequence the control template using both a forward and a reverse primer in the same run. If the G-peak loss is observed in all four resulting traces (sample forward, sample reverse, control forward, control reverse), a template-specific artifact is ruled out.\n\n3.  **Distinguishing Reagent vs. Instrument Failure:** A failure of the instrument's detection channel for the guanine dye would produce an identical chromatogram pattern: a global loss of G-colored peaks. A method is required to test the detector independently of the sequencing reaction. The problem states the size standard uses a distinct dye, so it cannot be used for this purpose. The definitive test is a spectral calibration. This procedure involves running a set of pure dye standards through the instrument to measure its sensitivity and spectral separation for each dye channel. If the guanine-dye channel performs correctly during spectral calibration, the instrument is functional, and the fault must lie with the sequencing reaction chemistry (i.e., the depleted $ddGTP$).\n\n4.  **Confirmatory Tests:** The hypothesis of $ddGTP$ depletion can be directly tested by repeating the sequencing reactions for both the sample and the control using a new, unexpired batch of dye-terminator mix. If the guanine peaks are restored, this confirms the original reagent was faulty. In combination with a successful spectral calibration run, this provides a definitive diagnosis.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this derived solution.\n\n**A. Include in the same CE run a known-sequence plasmid control with approximately even base composition and frequent cytosines, sequenced with both forward and reverse primers alongside the suspect sample. If ddGTP is depleted, predict near-complete loss or severe attenuation of guanine-colored peaks distributed across the entire readable range in both forward and reverse traces for both control and sample, with adenine-, cytosine-, and thymine-colored peaks otherwise normal in height and spacing; the single-dye size standard trace remains normal because its dye is distinct from the sequencing dyes. Confirm by re-running the identical templates with a fresh lot of dye-terminator mix to restore guanine peaks, and by running a multi-dye spectral calibration to verify that the guanine detection channel is functional, thereby distinguishing reagent depletion from detector failure.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option perfectly matches our derived solution.\n    - The control (known plasmid, frequent $C$s, forward and reverse primers) is ideal for ruling out template-specific artifacts.\n    - The prediction (global loss of G-colored peaks in all traces) is chemically correct.\n    - It correctly identifies the two necessary confirmatory tests: re-running with a fresh reagent lot (to confirm reagent failure) and performing a spectral calibration (to rule out detector failure). This combination provides complete and unambiguous discrimination between the possible causes.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Omit any DNA template in a no-template control and load only the single-dye size standard. If ddGTP is depleted, predict that guanine-colored size-standard peaks disappear, while other colors remain; confirm by repeating the same no-template control with a new ddGTP aliquot to see guanine peaks return.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option is fundamentally flawed. A no-template control is used to detect contamination; it cannot test the enzymatic sequencing reaction as no synthesis occurs. The prediction is nonsensical: the size standard is a set of pre-synthesized, pre-labeled DNA fragments. Its composition is entirely independent of the $ddNTPs$ in the reaction mix. The disappearance of its peaks would indicate a problem with the size standard reagent itself or the instrument, not the sequencing mix.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Sequence a control template that is cytosine-rich using only a forward primer. If ddGTP is depleted, predict that cytosine-colored peaks are selectively missing in the read; confirm by sequencing the reverse primer on the same template and expecting cytosine-colored peaks to return if the problem was strand-specific.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option contains two critical errors. First, the prediction is wrong. Depletion of $ddGTP$ results in missing **guanine ($G$)**-colored peaks, not cytosine ($C$)-colored peaks. Termination occurs with a labeled $G$ opposite a template $C$. Second, by using only a forward primer in the initial control run, it fails to meet the requirement of a single-run control that can distinguish a systemic problem from a strand-specific one from the outset.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use a hairpin-forming, guanine-cytosine–rich template as the control and run it with the suspect sample. If ddGTP is depleted, predict compressions and drop-offs only in guanine-cytosine–rich segments of the read; confirm by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or betaine to reduce secondary structure and expecting the pattern to normalize if ddGTP was the root cause.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option conflates two entirely different problems. \"Compressions and drop-offs\" in $GC$-rich regions are characteristic of template secondary structure (hairpins), a template-context artifact. Global $ddGTP$ depletion causes a global loss of G-peaks. The proposed control is designed to investigate a secondary structure, not a reagent failure. The confirmatory test is also incorrect; adding $DMSO$ or betaine addresses secondary structure. If this \"normalizes\" the pattern, it proves the cause was a hairpin, *disproving* that $ddGTP$ depletion was the root cause. The logic is inverted.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A provides the only scientifically sound, complete, and logically coherent strategy that satisfies all constraints of the problem. It correctly identifies the appropriate control, predicts the resulting pattern, and proposes the correct set of confirmatory tests to unambiguously diagnose the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2841508"}]}
