The \"NGG\" PAM for SpCas9 is a fundamental fact in the field of gene editing. The probabilistic model, assuming independent and identically distributed nucleotides, is a standard and useful first-order approximation in bioinformatics for estimating sequence motif frequencies. The provided parameters for genome length and GC content are realistic for the human genome. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided and no internal contradictions. The instructions are clear and unambiguous. The problem is formalizable and requires direct application of probability theory. Thus, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts, as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of PAM Frequency Expression**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the expected per-base frequency of the \"NGG\" PAM motif. This is equivalent to finding the probability, $P_{\\text{NGG}}$, that a randomly selected window of length $3$ on the designated strand has the sequence \"NGG\".\n\nThe model assumes that nucleotides at different positions are independent. Therefore, the probability of a specific sequence is the product of the probabilities of the individual nucleotides at each position. The PAM motif is a sequence of three nucleotides: the first is 'N' (any nucleotide), the second is 'G' (guanine), and the third is 'G' (guanine).\n\nThe probability of the first nucleotide being 'N' is the sum of the probabilities of it being 'A', 'T', 'C', or 'G'.\n$$ \\Pr(N) = \\Pr(A) + \\Pr(T) + \\Pr(C) + \\Pr(G) $$\nUsing the provided single-strand probabilities in terms of the GC fraction $g$:\n$$ \\Pr(A) = \\frac{1-g}{2} $$\n$$ \\Pr(T) = \\frac{1-g}{2} $$\n$$ \\Pr(C) = \\frac{g}{2} $$\n$$ \\Pr(G) = \\frac{g}{2} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Pr(N)$:\n$$ \\Pr(N) = \\frac{1-g}{2} + \\frac{1-g}{2} + \\frac{g}{2} + \\frac{g}{2} = \\frac{(1-g) + (1-g) + g + g}{2} = \\frac{2-2g+2g}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 $$\nAs expected, the probability of observing any nucleotide at a position is $1$.\n\nThe probability of the \"NGG\" motif at any given $3$-base window is thus:\n$$ P_{\\text{NGG}} = \\Pr(N) \\times \\Pr(G) \\times \\Pr(G) $$\nSubstituting the known probabilities:\n$$ P_{\\text{NGG}} = 1 \\times \\left(\\frac{g}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{g}{2}\\right) = \\frac{g^2}{4} $$\nThis expression represents the expected per-base frequency of the \"NGG\" PAM motif.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Expected Number of PAM Sites**\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of \"NGG\" PAM sites, which we denote as $E[N_{\\text{NGG}}]$, in a genome of length $L$. We are instructed to approximate the number of possible starting positions for a $3$-base window as $L$.\n\nLet $I_i$ be an indicator random variable for each starting position $i$ from $1$ to $L$. $I_i=1$ if the window starting at position $i$ is \"NGG\", and $I_i=0$ otherwise. The expected value of this indicator variable is the probability of the event:\n$$ E[I_i] = \\Pr(I_i=1) = P_{\\text{NGG}} = \\frac{g^2}{4} $$\nThe total number of \"NGG\" sites, $N_{\\text{NGG}}$, is the sum of these indicator variables over all possible starting positions:\n$$ N_{\\text{NGG}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} I_i $$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of sites is:\n$$ E[N_{\\text{NGG}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{L} I_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[I_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{g^2}{4} = L \\times \\frac{g^2}{4} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $L = 3 \\times 10^9$ and $g = 0.41$.\n$$ E[N_{\\text{NGG}}] = (3 \\times 10^9) \\times \\frac{(0.41)^2}{4} $$\nFirst, calculate the squared term and the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{(0.41)^2}{4} = \\frac{0.1681}{4} = 0.042025 $$\nNext, multiply by the genome length $L$:\n$$ E[N_{\\text{NGG}}] = (3 \\times 10^9) \\times 0.042025 = 0.126075 \\times 10^9 $$\nTo express this result in standard scientific notation ($a \\times 10^b$ where $1 \\le a < 10$), we adjust the mantissa and exponent:\n$$ E[N_{\\text{NGG}}] = 1.26075 \\times 10^8 $$\nFinally, the problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n$$ E[N_{\\text{NGG}}] \\approx 1.26 \\times 10^8 $$\nThis is the final numerical answer for the expected count of \"NGG\" PAM sites on one strand of a genome with the specified characteristics.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.26 \\times 10^{8}} $$", "id": "2802366"}, {"introduction": "Once Cas9 creates a double-strand break, the cell's repair machinery often introduces small insertions or deletions (indels) that can disrupt a gene's function. This exercise [@problem_id:2802399] delves into the genetic consequences of these edits by calculating the probability that a random indel will cause a frameshift mutation, the primary mechanism for gene knockout. Understanding this principle is crucial for predicting the functional outcome of a CRISPR-based gene disruption experiment.", "problem": "A researcher applies Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (Cas9) to introduce a double-strand break within a coding exon of a gene. The break occurs at a position with codon phase $p \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$, where $p$ is defined as the number of nucleotides from the nearest upstream codon boundary to the cut site (so $p=0$ means the cut lies exactly between codons, $p=1$ after the first nucleotide of a codon, and $p=2$ after the second). The lesion is repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which produces a single small insertion or deletion (indel) of length $s$ base pairs immediately at the cut site. Assume the following:\n- Translation reads nucleotides in contiguous codons of length $3$ starting from a fixed start codon, and the reading frame downstream of the cut is determined entirely by the net nucleotide offset introduced by the indel.\n- Indel magnitudes $s \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ are equally likely (a uniform distribution over sizes), and the sign (insertion versus deletion) is equally likely and independent of $s$. You may assume that only the magnitude $s$ matters for the reading frame outcome.\n- Ignore all effects other than reading frame (for example, do not consider premature termination codons, splicing changes, or nonsense-mediated decay).\n\nUsing only the fundamental fact that translation partitions coding sequence into codons of length $3$ nucleotides and that an indel of magnitude $s$ shifts the downstream nucleotide grouping by $s$ nucleotides, first reason, for an arbitrary but fixed codon phase $p$, which of the indel magnitudes $s \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ will induce a frameshift.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics, well-posed, and internally consistent. It presents a simplified but coherent model of CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutations and their effect on the genetic reading frame. The problem can be solved using fundamental principles of genetics and basic probability theory.\n\nThe central concept is the genetic reading frame. In protein-coding regions of a gene, the nucleotide sequence is read by the ribosome in contiguous, non-overlapping groups of three, known as codons. An insertion or deletion (indel) of $s$ nucleotides shifts the positions of all nucleotides downstream of the event. A frameshift mutation occurs if this shift disrupts the original triplet grouping. This happens if and only if the magnitude of the shift, $s$, is not an integer multiple of $3$. Mathematically, a frameshift occurs if $s \\pmod 3 \\neq 0$. If $s \\pmod 3 = 0$, the indel is \"in-frame\" and does not alter the reading frame of the subsequent codons, although it does add or remove one or more full codons.\n\nThe problem introduces the parameter $p \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, the codon phase of the cut site. This parameter specifies the location of the double-strand break relative to the boundary of the codon in which it occurs. However, the reading frame for the entire sequence downstream of the indel is determined by the total number of nucleotides added or removed, which is given by the indel size $s$. While the phase $p$ would be relevant for determining the exact sequence of the first altered codon at the repair junction, it has no bearing on whether the reading frame for the rest of the gene is shifted. The net shift is always $s$ nucleotides. Therefore, the condition for a frameshift, $s \\pmod 3 \\neq 0$, is independent of the codon phase $p$.\n\nThe problem asks to first consider which indel magnitudes $s \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ will induce a frameshift. We apply the established condition:\n- For $s=1$: $1 \\pmod 3 = 1$. Since $1 \\neq 0$, an indel of size $1$ base pair causes a frameshift.\n- For $s=2$: $2 \\pmod 3 = 2$. Since $2 \\neq 0$, an indel of size $2$ base pairs causes a frameshift.\n- For $s=3$: $3 \\pmod 3 = 0$. An indel of size $3$ base pairs is in-frame and does not cause a frameshift.\n\nNext, we extend this reasoning to $s=4$:\n- For $s=4$: $4 \\pmod 3 = 1$. Since $1 \\neq 0$, an indel of size $4$ base pairs causes a frameshift.\n\nThe problem states that a random indel is drawn with size $s$ from the set $\\mathcal{S} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, with a uniform probability distribution. This means the probability of any specific size $s_i$ being chosen is:\n$$P(s=s_i) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{S}|} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nfor each $s_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nWe need to compute the expected probability that a randomly drawn indel will cause a frameshift. Let $F$ be the event that a frameshift occurs. This event corresponds to the outcomes where the indel size $s$ is not a multiple of $3$. From our analysis, the set of sizes that cause a frameshift is $\\mathcal{S}_F = \\{1, 2, 4\\}$.\n\nThe probability of event $F$ is the sum of the probabilities of the individual, mutually exclusive outcomes that constitute $F$:\n$$P(F) = P(s=1) + P(s=2) + P(s=4)$$\nSubstituting the probabilities from the uniform distribution:\n$$P(F) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(F) = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nThe information regarding the equal likelihood of insertions versus deletions is superfluous, as the problem correctly allows the assumption that only the magnitude $s$ determines the frameshift outcome.

The problem states that this is a Bernoulli trial with a probability of success $p$.\n$$\nP(K_i) = p\n$$\nThe event that an allele is *not* knocked out is the complement event, with probability $1-p$.\n\nA cell is defined as a \"complete functional knockout\" if and only if all of its alleles for the specified locus are knocked out. The expected fraction of such cells in a large, unselected population is equivalent to the probability that a single, randomly selected cell is a complete functional knockout.\n\n(i) The Diploid Population\nIn a diploid cell, there are $n=2$ homologous alleles. For the cell to be a complete knockout, both allele $1$ and allele $2$ must be knocked out. Let $C_d$ be the event that a diploid cell is a complete knockout. This corresponds to the joint event $K_1 \\cap K_2$.\n$$\nC_d = K_1 \\cap K_2\n$$\nThe problem explicitly states that the editing events for each allele are independent. Therefore, the probability of the joint event is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(C_d) = P(K_1 \\cap K_2) = P(K_1) \\times P(K_2)\n$$\nSubstituting the given probability $p$ for each event:\n$$\nP(C_d) = p \\times p = p^2\n$$\nThus, the expected fraction of complete functional knockouts in the diploid population is $p^2$.\n\n(ii) The Tetraploid Population\nIn a tetraploid cell, there are $n=4$ homologous alleles.
