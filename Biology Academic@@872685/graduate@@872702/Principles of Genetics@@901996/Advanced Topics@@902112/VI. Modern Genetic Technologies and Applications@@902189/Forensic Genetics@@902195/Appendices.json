Mendelian Transmission Probability: $\\Pr(\\text{child} \\mid \\text{parents})$**\n\nThe conditional probabilities, such as $\\Pr(g_A \\mid g_{G_1}, g_{G_2})$, are governed by Mendelian laws of segregation. A function `prob_transmission(child_gt, p1_gt, p2_gt)` is created for this. Given child genotype $\\{c_1, c_2\\}$ and parent genotypes, the probability is:\n- If $c_1 = c_2$: $\\Pr(p1 \\to c_1) \\times \\Pr(p2 \\to c_1)$\n- If $c_1 \\neq c_2$: $\\Pr(p1 \\to c_1) \\times \\Pr(p2 \\to c_2) + \\Pr(p1 \\to c_2) \\times \\Pr(p2 \\to c_1)$\nThese transmission probabilities are calculated on the fly and memoized (cached) to avoid redundant computations, which is crucial given they are called within deeply nested loops.\n\n**c. Assembling $\\mathcal{L}_1$**\n\nThe final computation of $\\mathcal{L}_1$ proceeds algorithmically by iterating over all possible genotypes for the unobserved grandparents, $G_1$ and $G_2$, and the parent $P$.\n1.  All possible genotypes at a locus are generated from its allele set. Unordered genotypes are represented by a canonical sorted tuple, e.g., $\\{10, 11\\}$ becomes `(10, 11)`, to serve as unique dictionary keys.\n2.  The main calculation consists of nested loops iterating through all possible genotypes for $g_{G_1}$ and $g_{G_2}$.\n3.  Inside these loops, the term $\\Pr(g_{G_1}) \\Pr(g_{G_2}) \\Pr(g_A \\mid g_{G_1}, g_{G_2})$ is computed.\n4.  A third, inner loop over all possible genotypes $g_P$ calculates the term $\\sum_{g_P} \\Pr(g_P \\mid g_{G_1}, g_{G_2}) J(g_P)$.\n5.  The product of these components is added to a running sum for $\\mathcal{L}_1$.\n\n**3. Program Structure**\n\nThe program is encapsulated within a `solve()` function. It defines the test cases as specified. For each case, it initializes a combined $\\mathrm{LR}$ to $1.0$ and iterates through the loci. For each locus, it calls a function `calculate_locus_lr` that implements the logic described above to find $\\mathcal{L}_1/\\mathcal{L}_0$. The resulting locus-specific $\\mathrm{LR}$ is multiplied into the running product. Finally, the list of combined $\\mathrm{LR}$ values for all test cases is formatted and printed to standard output as required.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n\ndef normalize_genotype(g):\n    \"\"\"Represents an unordered genotype as a sorted tuple for consistent hashing.\"\"\"\n    return tuple(sorted(g))\n\ndef get_all_genotypes(alleles):\n    \"\"\"Generates all possible unordered genotypes from a list of alleles.\"\"\"\n    return [normalize_genotype(g) for g in combinations_with_replacement(alleles, 2)]\n\ndef prob_hwe(genotype, freqs):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the genotype probability under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.\"\"\"\n    a1, a2 = genotype\n    if a1 == a2:\n        return freqs[a1] ** 2\n    else:\n        return 2 * freqs[a1] * freqs[a2]\n\ndef prob_gamete(parent_gt, allele):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the probability of a parent transmitting a specific allele.\"\"\"\n    p1, p2 = parent_gt\n    if p1 == p2:\n        return 1.0 if allele == p1 else 0.0\n    else:\n        return 0.5 if allele == p1 or allele == p2 else 0.0\n\ndef calculate_J(gp, gB, freqs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates J(g_P) = Pr(child is gB | one parent is gP, other is random mate).\n    This corresponds to the innermost summation over founder O.\n    \"\"\"\n    b1, b2 = gB\n    f_b1 = freqs[b1]\n    f_b2 = freqs[b2]\n    \n    p_P_to_b1 = prob_gamete(gp, b1)\n    p_P_to_b2 = prob_gamete(gp, b2)\n    \n    if b1 == b2:\n        return p_P_to_b1 * f_b1\n    else:\n        return p_P_to_b1 * f_b2 + p_P_to_b2 * f_b1\n\ndef prob_transmission(child_gt, p1_gt, p2_gt, memo):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Pr(child | parent1, parent2) using Mendelian laws.\n    Uses memoization to cache results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Normalize parent order to reduce cache size\n    key = (child_gt, tuple(sorted((p1_gt, p2_gt))))\n    if key in memo:\n        return memo[key]\n    \n    c1, c2 = child_gt\n    \n    # Probability of transmitting alleles from each parent\n    p1_c1 = prob_gamete(p1_gt, c1)\n    p1_c2 = prob_gamete(p1_gt, c2)\n    p2_c1 = prob_gamete(p2_gt, c1)\n    p2_c2 = prob_gamete(p2_gt, c2)\n    \n    # Combine probabilities for child genotype\n    if c1 == c2:\n        prob = p1_c1 * p2_c1\n    else:\n        prob = p1_c1 * p2_c2 + p1_c2 * p2_c1\n        \n    memo[key] = prob\n    return prob\n\ndef calculate_locus_lr(locus_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the likelihood ratio for a single locus.\n    Implements the Elston-Stewart recursion for the avuncular pedigree.\n    \"\"\"\n    freq_map, gA_raw, gB_raw = locus_data\n    \n    gA = normalize_genotype(gA_raw)\n    gB = normalize_genotype(gB_raw)\n    alleles = list(freq_map.keys())\n    all_gts = get_all_genotypes(alleles)\n    \n    # Calculate L0: Likelihood under H0 (unrelated)\n    pr_gA_hwe = prob_hwe(gA, freq_map)\n    pr_gB_hwe = prob_hwe(gB, freq_map)\n    L0 = pr_gA_hwe * pr_gB_hwe\n    \n    if L0 == 0:\n        # If L0 is 0 and L1 is non-zero, LR is infinite.
