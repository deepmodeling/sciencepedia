{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The success of any base editing experiment begins with a critical first step: determining if the target nucleotide is accessible. The editor's ability to bind and modify DNA is governed by strict molecular rules, primarily the requirement for a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence and a fixed-distance \"editing window\". This exercise [@problem_id:1480056] challenges you to think like a researcher designing an experiment, integrating the constraints of PAM location and the editing window to evaluate the feasibility of correcting a specific pathogenic mutation.", "problem": "A research team is investigating a genetic disorder caused by a single point mutation in the human `NEUROXIN-4` gene. The mutation is a C-to-T transition at position 31 of the coding strand, which results in a premature stop codon. To correct this mutation in a cell line, the team plans to use a state-of-the-art Adenine Base Editor (ABE).\n\nThis ABE system consists of a deaminase enzyme fused to a *Streptococcus pyogenes* Cas9 nickase. This specific editor recognizes the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence 5'-NGG-3'. The guide RNA (gRNA) complexes with the editor and directs it to a 20-nucleotide target sequence in the genome called the protospacer. Successful binding requires the PAM sequence to be located on the non-target DNA strand, immediately 3' to the site where the gRNA binds.\n\nOnce bound, the ABE's deaminase chemically converts an adenine (A) to an inosine (I), which is then read as a guanine (G) by cellular machinery, effectively creating an A-to-G edit. The activity of the deaminase is restricted to a narrow \"editing window\": it can only modify adenines on the non-target strand (the strand not bound by the gRNA) that are opposite to positions 4 through 8 of the 20-nucleotide protospacer sequence. Position 1 of the protospacer is defined as the nucleotide furthest from the PAM sequence.\n\nBelow is the 50-base-pair sequence of the coding strand of the mutant `NEUROXIN-4` gene, with the pathogenic C-to-T mutation located at position 31.\n\nCoding Strand: 5'-`GATTACATAT TCCGGTCTGC AGTGGCCTGT TTTCGCTACC TTCTTCGCTA`-3'\n\nGiven the operational constraints of the ABE system, what is the most likely outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The experiment will succeed because the adenine base editor can effectively target and correct the adenine on the template strand that corresponds to the pathogenic thymine.\nB. The experiment will fail because the only available Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) on the correct strand positions the editing window far from the target adenine.\nC. The experiment will fail because adenine base editors are designed to convert G-C pairs to A-T pairs, and cannot be used to reverse this process.\nD. The experiment will fail because an adenine base editor is the wrong tool; correcting a C-to-T mutation requires a cytosine base editor that can convert thymine back to cytosine.\nE. The experiment will succeed because a gRNA can be designed to bind to the template strand, positioning the editor to correct the pathogenic adenine directly.", "solution": "The goal is to correct a C-to-T mutation at coding position 31. This means the coding strand has a T, and the template strand has an A at this position. To restore the original C on the coding strand, we must edit the A on the template strand to a G. This is the function of an Adenine Base Editor (ABE).\n\nThe editing process is constrained by several rules:\n1.  **Target Base:** The ABE must act on the adenine (A) located on the template strand opposite coding position 31.\n2.  **Deaminase Action:** The ABE's deaminase acts on the non-target strand (the strand not bound by the gRNA). Therefore, to edit the template strand, the gRNA must bind to the coding strand. This makes the coding strand the \"target strand\" and the template strand the \"non-target strand\".\n3.  **PAM Requirement:** The *S. pyogenes* Cas9 requires a 5'-NGG-3' PAM on the non-target strand. Since the non-target strand is the template strand, we must find an NGG sequence on the template strand. This corresponds to a 5'-CCN-3' sequence on the coding strand.\n4.  **PAM Position:** The PAM must be located immediately 3' to the gRNA binding site. This means the protospacer (20 nt) is immediately 5' (upstream) of the PAM.\n5.  **Editing Window:** The deaminase acts opposite protospacer positions 4-8. The problem defines position 1 as the nucleotide *furthest* from the PAM. This means the numbering is `N1, N2, ..., N20-[PAM]`. The editing window is opposite positions 4 through 8 in this numbering scheme.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the given sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Find all possible PAM sites.**\nWe search the 50-bp coding strand for 5'-CCN-3' sequences. Let `c` be the starting position of the PAM.\n*   Positions 12-14: `CCG` ($c=12$)\n*   Positions 26-28: `CCT` ($c=26$)\n*   Positions 39-41: `CCT` ($c=39$)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the editing window for each PAM.**\nThe protospacer is the 20-nt sequence immediately upstream (5') of the PAM site. For a PAM starting at position `c`, the protospacer occupies positions `c-20` to `c-1`.\nThe numbering starts from the PAM-distal end: position `N1` corresponds to coding position `c-20`, `N2` to `c-19`, and so on.\nThe editing window is opposite protospacer positions 4 to 8. This corresponds to positions `N4`, `N5`, `N6`, `N7`, `N8`.\nThe coding position for protospacer position `k` is `(c-20) + k - 1`.\n*   Window start (opposite N4): `(c-20) + 4 - 1 = c - 17`\n*   Window end (opposite N8): `(c-20) + 8 - 1 = c - 13`\nSo, for a PAM at `c`, the editable window on the template strand is opposite coding strand positions from `c-17` to `c-13`.\n\n**Step 3: Check if the target (position 31) falls into any window.**\nWe need to find if any PAM allows the window `[c-17, c-13]` to contain position 31.\n*   For the PAM at $c=12$: The protospacer would be at positions -8 to 11, which is not fully contained in the sequence. The window would be at positions `12-17 = -5` to `12-13 = -1`. Not viable.\n*   For the PAM at $c=26$: The window is opposite coding positions `26-17=9` to `26-13=13`. The target at position 31 is not in this window.\n*   For the PAM at $c=39$: The window is opposite coding positions `39-17=22` to `39-13=26`. The target at position 31 is not in this window.\n\n**Conclusion:** None of the available PAM sites on the correct strand allow the ABE's editing window to be positioned over the target adenine at position 31. Therefore, the experiment will fail.\n\n*   A and E are incorrect because no valid gRNA can position the editor correctly.\n*   C is scientifically incorrect. ABEs perform A-to-G edits (on the DNA level, $A \\cdot T \\to G \\cdot C$), which is exactly what's needed to reverse a pathogenic $G \\cdot C \\to A \\cdot T$ mutation.\n*   D is incorrect. A cytosine base editor (CBE) performs C-to-T edits; it cannot directly convert a T back to a C. The correct tool is an ABE, but the local sequence context prevents its use.\n\nThe failure is due to the geometric constraints imposed by the PAM location and the fixed editing window.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1480056"}, {"introduction": "Once an editing strategy is designed, the next crucial step is to predict its impact across a population of cells.

They are working with a large, homogeneous population of somatic cells cultured from a patient who is homozygous for the pathogenic allele. Let's denote the wild-type allele as '$A$' and the pathogenic recessive allele as '$a$'. Thus, all cells in the initial population have the genotype '$aa$'.\n\nThe team applies a cutting-edge Prime Editing (PE) system designed to correct the pathogenic allele by converting '$a$' into '$A$'. The PE system acts on each of the two alleles within a diploid cell independently. The single-allele editing efficiency, defined as the probability that any given '$a$' allele is successfully converted to an '$A$' allele during the treatment process, is determined to be $p_e = 0.30$. The treatment does not introduce any other types of mutations.\n\nAfter the treatment is complete, what are the expected final proportions of cells with genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ in the population? Present your answer as a set of three decimal values, corresponding to the proportions of $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ cells, respectively.", "solution": "Each cell is diploid and starts with genotype $aa$, meaning two independent target alleles per cell are subject to editing. Let the single-allele editing probability be $p_{e}$; each allele independently converts $a \\to A$ with probability $p_{e}$ and remains $a$ with probability $1 - p_{e}$.\n\nFor a given cell, the number of successfully edited alleles, $K$, follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=2$ trials (the two alleles) and probability of success $p=p_{e}$. The resulting genotype is determined by $K$:\n- $K=2$ (both alleles edited) yields genotype $AA$.\n- $K=1$ (one allele edited) yields genotype $Aa$.\n- $K=0$ (no alleles edited) yields genotype $aa$.\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we can calculate the expected proportions for each genotype. Given $p_{e} = 0.30$, the probability of an allele remaining unedited is $1 - p_{e} = 0.70$.\n\nThe probability of a cell having genotype $AA$ is the probability of two successful edits:\n$$P(AA) = P(K=2) = p_{e}^{2} = (0.30)^{2} = 0.09$$\n\nThe probability of a cell having genotype $Aa$ is the probability of one successful edit and one failure. There are two ways this can happen (first allele edited, second not; or vice versa), so:\n$$P(Aa) = P(K=1) = 2 p_{e} (1 - p_{e}) = 2 \\cdot 0.30 \\cdot 0.70 = 0.42$$\n\nThe probability of a cell having genotype $aa$ is the probability of zero successful edits (two failures):\n$$P(aa) = P(K=0) = (1 - p_{e})^{2} = (0.70)^{2} = 0.49$$\n\nTherefore, the expected final proportions in the order ($AA$, $Aa$, $aa$) are $(0.09, 0.42, 0.49)$. As a check, the proportions sum to $0.09 + 0.42 + 0.49 = 1.00$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0.09 & 0.42 & 0.49\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1480069"}, {"introduction": "After conducting a base editing experiment, raw output from next-generation sequencing must be translated into a statistically robust measure of success.
