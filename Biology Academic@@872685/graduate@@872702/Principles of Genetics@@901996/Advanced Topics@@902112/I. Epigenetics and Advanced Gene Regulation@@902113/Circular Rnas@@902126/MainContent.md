## Introduction
Once dismissed as rare artifacts of aberrant [splicing](@entry_id:261283), circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as a widespread and abundant class of RNA molecules with profound regulatory potential. Their unique, covalently closed structure confers remarkable stability, allowing them to accumulate in cells and participate in a diverse range of biological processes. However, the principles governing their formation and the full spectrum of their functions are still areas of active investigation. This article bridges this gap by providing a comprehensive exploration of circRNA biology. We will first dissect the fundamental **Principles and Mechanisms** that govern their [biogenesis](@entry_id:177915) and stability. Next, we will explore their functional roles and significance in the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter, examining their impact on fields from neuroscience to immunology. Finally, a series of **Hands-On Practices** will provide insight into the experimental and computational methods used to study these fascinating molecules. We begin by delving into the molecular intricacies that define circRNAs, starting with the unique [splicing](@entry_id:261283) event that creates them.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Following the introduction to the burgeoning field of circular RNAs (circRNAs), this chapter delves into the fundamental principles and diverse molecular mechanisms that govern their [biogenesis](@entry_id:177915), classification, and intrinsic properties. We will dissect the enzymatic processes that generate these unique molecules, explore the sequence and structural features that regulate their formation, and examine how their circular topology confers remarkable stability.

### The Hallmark of Back-Splicing: A Unique Molecular Identifier

The most prevalent class of circular RNAs in eukaryotes, exonic circRNAs (ecircRNAs), are defined by a unique covalent linkage known as the **back-splice junction (BSJ)**. In canonical linear splicing, the spliceosome ligates the end of an upstream exon to the beginning of a downstream exon, preserving the genomic $5'$ to $3'$ order. Back-[splicing](@entry_id:261283), by contrast, is a non-canonical reaction where a downstream $5'$ splice donor site is covalently joined to an upstream $3'$ splice acceptor site. This event scrambles the genomic order and creates the circular topology.

This back-splice junction is more than just a structural feature; it is the definitive molecular signature of the circRNA. For a given [gene locus](@entry_id:177958), a specific circRNA species can be uniquely identified at nucleotide resolution by the [ordered pair](@entry_id:148349) of genomic coordinates, $J = (d, a)$, that define the back-splice junction, where $d$ is the coordinate of the downstream $5'$ splice donor and $a$ is the coordinate of the upstream $3'$ splice acceptor ($a  d$). The observation of RNA sequencing reads that map in a split fashion to this non-colinear junction provides necessary and sufficient evidence for the existence of that specific circRNA species. This operational definition is robust because this $d \to a$ linkage cannot be generated by canonical linear splicing, trans-[splicing](@entry_id:261283) between different transcripts on the same locus (which can be ruled out by careful mapping), or the formation of intronic lariats, which involve a distinct $2'-5'$ chemical bond. While [alternative splicing](@entry_id:142813) events internal to the circularized region may produce different circRNA isoforms, they all share the same defining back-splice junction and are thus considered variants of the same circRNA species [@problem_id:2799266].

### Mechanisms of Biogenesis: Generating the Circle

The formation of a circRNA via [back-splicing](@entry_id:187945) presents a topological challenge: how are two distant splice sites on a linear pre-mRNA molecule brought into the close proximity required for catalysis by the spliceosome? The answer lies in mechanisms that either reconfigure the pre-mRNA's structure or utilize protein adaptors to bridge the required sites.

#### Spliceosome-Mediated Back-Splicing

The chemistry of [back-splicing](@entry_id:187945) is catalyzed by the same spliceosomal machinery responsible for linear splicing and proceeds through two consecutive, isoenergetic **transesterification reactions**. The key is that the [spliceosome](@entry_id:138521) assembles on a non-[canonical pairing](@entry_id:191846) of splice sites. For an exon $E_2$ flanked by two [introns](@entry_id:144362), [back-splicing](@entry_id:187945) proceeds as follows:

1.  **First Transesterification**: The $2'$-hydroxyl ($2'$-OH) of the branch-point adenosine within the *downstream* intron launches a [nucleophilic attack](@entry_id:151896) on the phosphate at the downstream $5'$ splice site (the $E_2$-intron junction). This reaction cleaves the pre-mRNA, creating a lariat-like intermediate on the downstream [intron](@entry_id:152563) and, crucially, leaving a free $3'$-OH group at the $3'$ end of exon $E_2$.

2.  **Second Transesterification**: This newly liberated $3'$-OH on exon $E_2$ then acts as the nucleophile, attacking the phosphate at the *upstream* $3'$ splice site (the [intron](@entry_id:152563)-$E_2$ junction). This reaction ligates the $3'$ end of $E_2$ to its own $5'$ end, forming a circular exon $E_2$ and releasing the flanking introns as a branched, lariat-containing molecule.

This sequence of events is chemically plausible and utilizes the spliceosome's canonical catalytic functions, merely redirecting them to a different topology [@problem_id:2799211]. The [rate-limiting step](@entry_id:150742) is often the initial juxtaposition of the back-splice sites, which is facilitated by two primary models.

#### The Intron Pairing Model

This model posits that complementary sequences within the introns flanking a circularizing exon can hybridize, forming an RNA duplex. This intramolecular base pairing physically brings the upstream $3'$ and downstream $5'$ splice sites into proximity, effectively shortening the contour length of the intervening RNA and increasing their effective local concentration for the [spliceosome](@entry_id:138521). In primates, inverted repeats of **Alu elements** are a major driver of such intron pairing.

The efficiency of this mechanism is governed by principles of polymer physics and thermodynamics. Any manipulation that stabilizes the intronic RNA duplex or shortens the remaining unpaired distance between splice sites is expected to increase the rate of [back-splicing](@entry_id:187945). For instance:
*   Replacing native inverted repeats with longer, more stable GC-rich sequences (with a more negative free energy of duplex formation, $\Delta G$) enhances circularization.
*   Moving the inverted repeats closer to their respective splice sites reduces the total contour length, boosting [contact probability](@entry_id:194741).
*   Conversely, factors that destabilize the duplex, such as A-to-I editing by the enzyme **ADAR1** (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA 1) or unwinding by RNA helicases like **DHX9**, will decrease circRNA production. Knocking down ADAR1 can therefore increase levels of certain circRNAs [@problem_id:2799181].

#### The Protein Bridge Model

In this model, the juxtaposition of splice sites is mediated by **RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)**. RBPs that can dimerize or contain multiple RNA-binding domains can simultaneously bind to recognition motifs located in the flanking introns. By binding to both [introns](@entry_id:144362), the RBP acts as a molecular "bridge," looping out the intervening exon and presenting the back-splice sites to the spliceosome.

A classic example is the STAR family protein **Quaking (QKI)**. QKI forms homodimers and binds to a specific motif known as the Quaking response element (QRE). When QREs are present in both the upstream and downstream introns of an exon, a QKI dimer can bridge them, dramatically increasing the effective local concentration of the back-splice sites and promoting circularization. The specificity of this mechanism can be demonstrated experimentally: mutating both QREs to abolish QKI binding specifically disrupts the formation of the circRNA without affecting the core [splicing](@entry_id:261283) signals, thus leaving canonical linear [splicing](@entry_id:261283) competent [@problem_id:2799207].

### A Taxonomy of Circular RNAs

While [spliceosome](@entry_id:138521)-mediated [back-splicing](@entry_id:187945) is a major pathway, it is not the only source of circular RNA. Different [biogenesis](@entry_id:177915) routes yield structurally and functionally distinct classes of circRNAs. A fundamental way to classify them is by their sequence composition and the chemical nature of the bond that closes the circle [@problem_id:2799206].

#### Spliceosome-Derived Circles: ecircRNAs and EIciRNAs

As discussed, **exonic circular RNAs (ecircRNAs)** are composed entirely of one or more exons joined by a canonical $3'-5'$ phosphodiester bond at the back-splice junction. These are the most commonly studied class and are typically exported to the cytoplasm.

In some cases, the splicing of an [intron](@entry_id:152563) contained within the circularizing region is inefficient. If [back-splicing](@entry_id:187945) occurs before this [intron](@entry_id:152563) is removed, the resulting molecule is an **exon-intron circular RNA (EIciRNA)**. These molecules retain one or more intronic sequences. The presence of these [introns](@entry_id:144362) can have profound functional consequences. Retained introns often contain $5'$ splice site motifs that can be recognized by the **U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP)**, a core component of the spliceosome. This EIciRNA-U1 snRNP interaction acts as a nuclear retention signal, tethering the EIciRNA to the transcription and [splicing](@entry_id:261283) machinery in the nucleus. Consequently, EIciRNAs are predominantly nuclear and can function to enhance the transcription of their parent gene, in stark contrast to the typically cytoplasmic ecircRNAs [@problem_id:2799261].

#### Lariat-Derived Circles: ciRNAs

A distinct class of circular RNAs originates not from [back-splicing](@entry_id:187945), but from the intron lariats that are excised during canonical splicing. Normally, these lariats are rapidly linearized for degradation by the **debranching enzyme (DBR1)**, which hydrolyzes the unique bond that defines the lariat structure.

This bond is a **$2'-5'$ phosphodiester linkage**, formed between the $5'$ end of the intron and the $2'$-[hydroxyl group](@entry_id:198662) of the branch-point adenosine. If an intron lariat evades debranching, it can persist as a stable nuclear species known as a **circular intronic RNA (ciRNA)**. The defining characteristic of a ciRNA is this internal $2'-5'$ linkage. Accumulation of ciRNAs is favored by specific [sequence motifs](@entry_id:177422) that are thought to protect the branchpoint from DBR1. These include a GU-rich element near the [intron](@entry_id:152563)'s $5'$ splice site and a C-rich element near the branchpoint [adenosine](@entry_id:186491) [@problem_id:2799226].

#### tRNA-Derived Circles: tricRNAs

A third major [biogenesis](@entry_id:177915) pathway, entirely independent of the spliceosome, produces **tRNA intronic circular RNAs (tricRNAs)**. Many precursor-tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) contain introns that must be removed. This process is carried out by a dedicated enzymatic machinery.

1.  **Cleavage**: The **tRNA [splicing](@entry_id:261283) endonuclease (TSEN)** complex recognizes a specific three-dimensional structure in the pre-tRNA's anticodon stem-loop, often a bulge-helix-bulge (BHB) motif. TSEN cleaves the pre-tRNA at two sites to excise the [intron](@entry_id:152563). This cleavage is dictated by the structure, not a simple primary sequence, and generates a linear intron with specific termini: a $5'$-hydroxyl ($5'$-OH) and a $2',3'$-cyclic phosphate.

2.  **Ligation**: The excised linear intron is then circularized by the RNA [ligase](@entry_id:139297) **RtcB**, which specifically joins a $5'$-OH to a $2',3'$-cyclic phosphate, forming a standard $3'-5'$ [phosphodiester bond](@entry_id:139342).

Because this pathway is completely independent of the spliceosome, tricRNA [biogenesis](@entry_id:177915) is insensitive to pharmacological inhibitors that target the [spliceosome](@entry_id:138521) [@problem_id:2799256]. Furthermore, since TSEN recognizes a structural motif, mutations that shift this structure's position relative to the annotated intron boundaries will correspondingly shift the cleavage sites, resulting in tricRNAs of altered but predictable lengths [@problem_id:2799212].

### A Consequence of Topology: Stability and Degradation

One of the most defining properties of circRNAs is their exceptional stability compared to their linear counterparts. This stability is a direct consequence of their covalently closed topology.

Cellular RNA degradation is largely carried out by **exonucleases**, enzymes that processively remove nucleotides from a free $5'$ or $3'$ end. Key cellular exonucleases, such as the $5' \to 3'$ exonuclease XRN1 and the $3' \to 5'$ [exosome complex](@entry_id:171750) (or the bacterial homolog Ribonuclease R, often used experimentally), require a free terminus to initiate degradation. Since circRNAs lack such termini, they are inherently resistant to exonucleolytic attack.

However, circRNAs are not immortal. Their degradation is mediated by **endonucleases**, enzymes that cleave internal [phosphodiester bonds](@entry_id:271137). A single endonucleolytic "nick" is sufficient to linearize a circRNA, rendering it susceptible to subsequent degradation by exonucleases. One important pathway for circRNA degradation is endonuclease cleavage guided by microRNAs (miRNAs) within the Argonaute 2 (AGO2) protein complex.

The rate of this initial, rate-limiting endonucleolytic cleavage can be quantified in a cell extract using a carefully designed assay. A purified, labeled circRNA is incubated with the extract in the presence of an excess of a potent exonuclease (e.g., Ribonuclease R), which serves as a "sink." This exonuclease cannot degrade the intact circle but will rapidly and irreversibly degrade any linear molecule produced by an endonucleolytic event. Therefore, the disappearance of the intact circRNA over time directly reports the rate of the initial nicking. The decay of the circRNA substrate concentration, $C(t)$, can be monitored by [gel electrophoresis](@entry_id:145354) or [northern blotting](@entry_id:276775) and fit to a first-order kinetic model, $C(t) = C_{0}\exp(-k_{\mathrm{obs}} t)$, where the observed rate constant $k_{\mathrm{obs}}$ provides a direct measure of the endonucleolytic cleavage rate, $k_{\mathrm{endo}}$ [@problem_id:2799241]. This combination of exonuclease resistance and endonuclease sensitivity is a fundamental principle stemming directly from the unique circular architecture of these fascinating molecules.
