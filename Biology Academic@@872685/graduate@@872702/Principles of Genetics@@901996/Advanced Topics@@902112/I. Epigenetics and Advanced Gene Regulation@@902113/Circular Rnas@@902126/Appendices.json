The analysis must be grounded in the provided first-order decay model.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the decay process. The problem states that the abundance $N(t)$ of any RNA isoform follows first-order kinetics, described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k N(t)\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the first-order decay rate constant, which is specific to each RNA species. This is a separable differential equation. Integrating from time $t=0$ to a later time $t$ yields the solution:\n$$\n\\int_{N(0)}^{N(t)} \\frac{dN}{N} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\n$$\nN(t) = N(0) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis equation describes the exponential decay of the RNA abundance from its initial value $N(0)$ at time $t=0$.\n\nNext, we use the operational definition of half-life, $t_{1/2}$. This is the time required for the abundance to decrease to one-half of its initial value. We substitute $t = t_{1/2}$ and $N(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} N(0)$ into the decay equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} N(0) = N(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $N(0)$, which is non-zero, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nThis gives the fundamental relationship between the half-life and the decay rate constant:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that a longer half-life corresponds to a smaller decay rate constant $k$.\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the provided data for each RNA isoform.\n\nFor the linear mRNA, we are given $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(t)$:\n- $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0) = 800$\n- $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(4) = 400$\nBy direct application of the definition of half-life, we observe that at $t=4 \\text{ h}$, the abundance $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(4)$ is exactly one-half of the initial abundance $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0)$.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{lin}}(4) = 400 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 800 = \\frac{1}{2} N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0)\n$$\nTherefore, the half-life of the linear mRNA is precisely:\n$$\nt_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{lin}} = 4 \\text{ h}\n$$\nThe remaining data points for the linear isoform ($N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(8)=200$ and $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(12)=100$) are consistent with this half-life, representing decays over two and three half-lives, respectively.\n\nFor the circular RNA, we are given $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(t)$:\n- $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(0) = 1000$\n- $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(12) = 500$\nAgain, by direct application of the definition, we observe that at $t=12 \\text{ h}$, the abundance $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(12)$ is exactly one-half of the initial abundance $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(0)$.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{circ}}(12) = 500 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{2} N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(0)\n$$\nTherefore, the half-life of the circular RNA is:\n$$\nt_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{circ}} = 12 \\text{ h}\n$$\nWe must verify that the other data points are consistent with this half-life. If $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{circ}} = 12 \\text{ h}$, then the decay constant is $k_{\\mathrm{circ}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{12}$.

As the result is an exact integer, we express it as $3.000$.\n\nThe biological significance of the result $R=3.000$ is that the circular RNA isoform is three times more stable than its linear mRNA counterpart produced from the same gene. This increased stability is a direct consequence of the molecular structure of RNA. Linear RNA molecules, including canonical mRNAs, possess free $5'$ and $3'$ ends. In the cytoplasm, these ends serve as entry points for exonucleases—enzymes that progressively degrade the RNA molecule from its termini. The major pathways of mRNA decay in eukaryotes are initiated by such exonucleolytic attack. In contrast, a circular RNA is a covalently closed continuous loop, and by definition, it lacks free $5'$ and $3'$ ends. This structure renders it inherently resistant to degradation by the majority of exonucleases that target linear RNAs. Because the primary degradation machinery for linear RNA is ineffective against circRNAs, their decay rate is significantly slower, resulting in a much longer operational half-life and greater stability within the cell. This differential stability is a key regulatory feature in gene expression, allowing a single gene to produce RNA isoforms with vastly different persistence times and, consequently, different functional potentials.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.000}$$", "id": "2799221"}, {"introduction": "While resistance to exonuclease digestion (e.g., with Ribonuclease R) is a hallmark of circRNAs, it is not absolute proof of circularity, as some highly structured linear RNAs can also resist degradation. This exercise challenges you to think critically like an experimentalist, selecting appropriate controls that exploit the unique topology, end-modifications, and sequence junctions of circRNAs. Mastering these validation principles is essential for confidently distinguishing true circular molecules from experimental artifacts. [@problem_id:2799234]", "problem": "You are evaluating a candidate circular RNA (circRNA) discovered in a human cell line. Initial data show that the candidate is enriched after digestion with Ribonuclease R (RNase R), a $3' \\to 5'$ exoribonuclease that degrades most linear RNAs but typically spares circRNAs. However, you are aware that some linear RNAs with strong secondary structures or bound proteins can also resist RNase R. You must design additional, orthogonal controls to distinguish RNase R-resistant linear RNAs from true circRNAs.\n\nUse only the following fundamental base:\n- Central Dogma: messenger RNA (mRNA) biogenesis produces capped $5'$ ends and polyadenylated $3'$ ends; splicing joins exons in genomic order, whereas back-splicing creates a covalently closed RNA circle lacking both a $5'$ cap and a $3'$ polyadenylate tail.\n- Exonuclease principles: $5' \\to 3'$ exonucleases require a $5'$ monophosphate substrate and cannot initiate on closed circles; $3' \\to 5'$ exonucleases require an accessible $3'$ end and cannot initiate on closed circles.\n- Hybrid-directed cleavage: Ribonuclease H (RNase H) cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA–DNA hybrid and therefore can be directed by a DNA oligonucleotide; a DNA oligonucleotide spanning a back-splice junction has contiguous complementarity only in a circRNA.\n- Polyadenylate selection: oligo(dT) selection enriches polyadenylated transcripts and depletes RNAs lacking poly(A) tails, including circRNAs.\n\nWhich of the following experimental controls are appropriate to increase confidence that the candidate is a true circRNA rather than an RNase R-resistant linear RNA? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Perform poly(A) selection and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion in parallel, then quantify the candidate by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A true circRNA should be relatively depleted in the poly(A)$^+$ fraction and enriched in the rRNA-depleted total RNA fraction compared with a matched linear mRNA.\n\nB. Decap total RNA with RNA pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH) or a decapping enzyme to generate $5'$ monophosphates, then treat with $5' \\to 3'$ exoribonuclease $1$ (XRN1). A true circRNA should resist degradation, whereas linear RNAs should be depleted.\n\nC. Direct RNase H cleavage using a DNA oligonucleotide that spans the predicted back-splice junction. A true circRNA should be specifically cleaved at the junction, whereas linear isoforms lacking the contiguous junction sequence should not be cleaved by that oligonucleotide.\n\nD. Reverse transcribe using only oligo(dT) primers and then amplify across the back-splice junction with divergent primers. If a product is obtained, it proves circularity.\n\nE. Increase the stringency of RNase R digestion by adding denaturants or raising temperature so that any remaining RNase R resistance must reflect circularity rather than structure.", "solution": "To rigorously distinguish a true circRNA from an RNase R-resistant linear RNA, we must use orthogonal experimental methods that probe the unique structural and sequence features of circRNAs: their lack of a poly(A) tail, their covalently closed topology (no free 5' or 3' ends), and the presence of a unique back-splice junction (BSJ).\n\n**A. Correct.** This method tests for the presence of a 3' poly(A) tail. True circRNAs lack a poly(A) tail, while most mature linear mRNAs are polyadenylated. Therefore, after poly(A) selection using oligo(dT) beads, a genuine circRNA will be depleted from the selected poly(A)$^+$ fraction, whereas a linear mRNA from the same gene will be enriched. Comparing the candidate's abundance in the poly(A)$^+$ fraction to its abundance in the starting material (rRNA-depleted total RNA) provides strong evidence for the absence of a poly(A) tail, a key feature of circRNAs.\n\n**B. Correct.** This method tests the topology, specifically the absence of an accessible 5' end. Most linear RNAs have a 5' cap. The enzyme RppH removes this cap, exposing a 5' monophosphate. The 5'→3' exoribonuclease XRN1 can then degrade any RNA with a 5' monophosphate. A true circRNA, being a covalently closed loop, has no 5' end. It is therefore not a substrate for either RppH or XRN1 and will resist degradation. In contrast, any linear RNA (even one resistant to RNase R due to structure) will be decapped and then degraded by XRN1. This resistance to sequential RppH and XRN1 treatment is a powerful indicator of circularity.\n\n**C. Correct.** This method directly tests for the defining molecular feature of a circRNA: the back-splice junction (BSJ). An oligonucleotide designed to be complementary to the unique sequence spanning the BSJ can only form a stable DNA-RNA hybrid with the circRNA. The enzyme RNase H specifically degrades the RNA strand of such a hybrid. Therefore, treatment with the BSJ-spanning oligo and RNase H will specifically cleave and linearize the circRNA, which can be verified by a size shift on a gel or by subsequent sensitivity to RNase R. Linear RNAs lack this contiguous BSJ sequence and will remain intact. This is a highly specific and definitive test for a back-spliced molecule.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** This method is flawed. The reverse transcription (RT) step uses only oligo(dT) primers. These primers require a poly(A) tail to initiate cDNA synthesis. Since canonical circRNAs lack a poly(A) tail, they would not be reverse transcribed in this reaction. Consequently, a subsequent PCR with divergent primers would fail to produce a product from a true circRNA. A positive result in this experiment would not prove circularity; instead, it would suggest a technical artifact or an atypical polyadenylated circRNA, contradicting the expected properties. The correct method would use random hexamers or gene-specific primers for the RT step.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** This is a poor experimental strategy. While the goal of increasing stringency is to eliminate artifacts, using harsh denaturants or high temperatures is unreliable. These conditions can easily inactivate the RNase R enzyme itself, leading to a false-positive result (resistance due to enzyme failure), or cause non-enzymatic degradation of the RNA, leading to a false-negative.

Use the following fundamental base:\n\n- The Central Dogma of molecular biology: DNA is transcribed to RNA, which may undergo splicing.\n- Canonical pre-messenger RNA splicing joins upstream donor sites to downstream acceptor sites in genomic order; back-splicing that defines circRNAs joins a downstream donor site to an upstream acceptor site on the same strand, producing junction-spanning reads whose two anchors map to the same gene in reverse genomic order.\n- Split-read alignment can decompose a read into two non-overlapping anchors that map to discontiguous loci, revealing splice junctions.\n- The probability that a random $l$-nucleotide sequence exactly matches a specific genomic position under a uniform and independent base model is $4^{-l}$; assume an effective searchable genome size of $N=3\\times 10^{9}$ nucleotides after excluding masked repeats.\n- You will configure the aligner such that the anchor segments used to assert a junction must match exactly (no mismatches or gaps within the anchors), though the remainder of the read may be soft-clipped.\n\nYour design goal is to construct a pipeline that: (i) identifies back-splice junction reads by split-read alignment with anchor segments mapping in reverse genomic order to the same annotated gene and on the same strand; (ii) controls false positives from spurious alignments and paralogous loci by imposing a minimum per-anchor length $l_{\\min}$ and additional filters; and (iii) sets $l_{\\min}$ so that the expected number of random exact matches for a single anchor across the effective genome is less than $\\epsilon=10^{-2}$.\n\nWhich of the following pipeline designs best satisfies these constraints while maintaining sensitivity, and specifies an appropriate $l_{\\min}$ under the stated model?\n\nA. Perform quality control and adapter trimming, then align reads with a splice-aware aligner in split/chimeric mode with exact-match anchors. Call a back-splice if both anchors from a single read map uniquely (mapping quality score $\\geq 20$) to the same annotated gene and strand, with the downstream genomic coordinate of the left anchor exceeding the upstream coordinate of the right anchor (reverse order), and with canonical splice dinucleotides flanking the putative donor and acceptor sites.

More importantly, its approach to anchor length—a minimum total of 30 bases—is incorrect. This does not guarantee that *each* anchor is specific enough to avoid random matches, which is the purpose of the $l_{\\min}$ constraint.

First, it allows a mismatch within each anchor, contradicting the \"exact-match anchors\" rule. Second, it uses $l_{\\min}=18$, which does not satisfy the statistical requirement ($E  10^{-2}$).
