Therefore, a child inherits an affected status for Angelman syndrome (AS) if and only if the pathogenic *UBE3A* allele is transmitted by the mother. Paternal transmission yields an unaffected carrier child in whom the pathogenic allele is silenced in neurons.\n\nLet us formalize the events and probabilities.\n\nGeneral facts for a heterozygous carrier parent:\n- The probability to transmit the pathogenic allele in a single meiosis is $1/2$.\n- The probability a child is female is $1/2$, and male is $1/2$, independent of allele transmission.\n- For the purposes of risk to grandchildren, we trace a single line of descent in which the carrier has exactly $1$ child who later has exactly $1$ child.

This exercise emphasizes the crucial biological process of germline imprint resetting, demonstrating why an unaffected parent can still have a high recurrence risk of $1/2$ for their offspring [@problem_id:2839351].", "problem": "A couple seeks risk counseling. The father is heterozygous for a microdeletion within the imprinting center at cytoband $\\text{15q11.2}$ that spans the bipartite Prader–Willi syndrome shortest region of overlap (PWS-SRO).

The father is clinically unaffected because the deletion resides on his maternally derived chromosome $\\text{15}$. The couple asks for the per-conception recurrence risk that a future child will have Prader–Willi syndrome.\n\nUse only the following fundamental principles as your starting point:\n- Mendelian segregation at an autosomal locus: a heterozygous parent transmits either allele with probability $1/2$.\n- Genomic imprinting: Prader–Willi syndrome arises when paternally expressed genes in $\\text{15q11–q13}$ are not expressed in the child; an imprinting center deletion spanning the PWS-SRO on the paternal allele prevents establishment of paternal marks and silences these genes in cis in the child.\n- Parent-of-origin effect: the deleterious outcome occurs only if the deletion is on the paternally transmitted allele in the child.\n\nAssume complete penetrance, random mating, no segregation distortion, no de novo events, and no germline mosaicism beyond the father’s heterozygous state. Under autosomal dominant transmission with a parent-of-origin effect as described, compute the recurrence risk per child for Prader–Willi syndrome. Express your answer as a single decimal or fractional number with no units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a recurrence risk based on the principles of Mendelian genetics and genomic imprinting. Let us denote the wild-type allele for the imprinting center region on chromosome $15$ as $W$ and the allele with the microdeletion as $D$.\n\nThe father is heterozygous, meaning his genotype at this locus is $W/D$. The problem specifies that the deletion allele $D$ resides on the chromosome $15$ he inherited from his mother, while the wild-type allele $W$ is on the chromosome $15$ he inherited from his father. This explains his unaffected status: in his somatic cells, the paternally inherited chromosome $15$ carries the $W$ allele, which is correctly expressed. The maternally inherited chromosome $15$ carries the $D$ allele, but this chromosomal region would be silenced by maternal imprinting anyway. Thus, he has exactly one functional set of the PWS-critical genes.\n\nThe critical phase for determining risk to his offspring is spermatogenesis. During gamete formation in a male, the existing parental imprints on his chromosomes are erased, and a new, paternal-specific imprint is established on both homologous chromosomes before they segregate into sperm. This is a fundamental concept of imprint resetting.\n\nThe father possesses two types of chromosome $15$: one with allele $W$ and one with allele $D$. According to the principle of Mendelian segregation, he will produce two populations of sperm in equal proportions:\n1.  Sperm carrying the chromosome $15$ with the wild-type allele $W$. The probability of producing such a sperm is $P(W) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  Sperm carrying the chromosome $15$ with the deletion allele $D$. The probability of producing such a sperm is $P(D) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe must now consider the outcome of fertilization of a normal oocyte by each type of sperm. A normal oocyte from the mother will contribute a maternally imprinted chromosome $15$ carrying the wild-type allele, $W_M$.\n\nCase 1: Fertilization by a sperm carrying the $W$ allele.\nThe resulting zygote receives a paternally contributed chromosome $15$ with the $W$ allele ($W_P$) and a maternally contributed chromosome $15$ with the $W$ allele ($W_M$). The genotype is $W_P/W_M$. In this child, the paternally expressed genes on chromosome $15$ are expressed from the $W_P$ allele. The child is clinically unaffected. The probability of this outcome is equal to the probability of the father passing on the $W$ allele, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nCase 2: Fertilization by a sperm carrying the $D$ allele.\nThe resulting zygote receives a paternally contributed chromosome $15$ with the $D$ allele ($D_P$) and a maternally contributed chromosome $15$ with the $W$ allele ($W_M$). The genotype is $D_P/W_M$. The problem states that an IC deletion on the paternal allele prevents the establishment of paternal marks. Consequently, the PWS-critical genes on the paternally inherited chromosome are not activated; they remain silenced, as if they were of maternal origin. The genes on the maternally inherited chromosome ($W_M$) are also silenced due to normal maternal imprinting. The result is a complete absence of expression of these vital genes. With the assumption of complete penetrance, this leads to Prader–Willi syndrome. The probability of this outcome is equal to the probability of the father passing on the $D$ allele, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence risk for Prader–Willi syndrome for any child of this father is the probability of Case 2 occurring. This risk is precisely $\\frac{1}{2}$. The fact that the deletion was on the father's own maternally derived chromosome is relevant only to his own phenotype, not to the risk for his children, because of the germline resetting of imprints.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2839351"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise bridges theoretical principles with practical molecular diagnostics, simulating a real-world clinical genetics scenario.

The proband's genotype must be fully explained by the chosen mechanism.\n\nFirst, we analyze the proband's genotype at each marker in the context of paternal-only inheritance.\n1.  **$\\mathrm{CEN}\\text{-}15$ Marker**: The father is heterozygous $(1/2)$, and the proband is also heterozygous $(1/2)$. Since the proband inherited chromosome $15$ only from the father, this means he received both of the father's distinct alleles, $1$ and $2$. This condition, where two different homologous chromosomes are inherited from a single parent, is termed **heterodisomy**. Paternal heterodisomy for a centromeric marker is the definitive sign of a nondisjunction event during **paternal meiosis I**, where homologous chromosomes fail to segregate.\n\n2.  **$\\mathrm{TEL}\\text{-}\\mathrm{p}15$ Marker**: The father is heterozygous $(1/2)$ and the proband is heterozygous $(1/2)$. This also represents paternal heterodisomy, consistent with a meiosis I error.\n\n3.  **$\\mathrm{TEL}\\text{-}\\mathrm{q}15$ Marker**: The father is heterozygous $(1/2)$, but the proband is homozygous $(2/2)$. This means the proband inherited two copies of the father's allele $2$ for this locus, and zero copies of allele $1$. This condition, where two identical copies of a single parental chromosome segment are inherited, is termed **isodisomy**.\n\nThe proband's chromosome $15$ pair exhibits heterodisomy for the region including the centromere and the p-arm, and isodisomy for the distal region of the q-arm. This combination of heterodisomy and isodisomy along a single chromosome can only be explained by a meiotic error accompanied by recombination (crossing over).\n\nLet us synthesize the mechanism:\n-   The presence of heterodisomy at the centromere ($\\mathrm{CEN}\\text{-}15$) firmly establishes the primary error as a **paternal meiosis I nondisjunction**.\n-   During prophase I of paternal meiosis, a crossover event must have occurred between the centromere and the $\\mathrm{TEL}\\text{-}\\mathrm{q}15$ locus.\n-   Let the father's two homologous chromosomes $15$ be $P_A$ and $P_B$, with alleles arranged as $P_A = (\\text{p-arm: }1, \\text{cen: }1, \\text{q-arm: }1)$ and $P_B = (\\text{p-arm: }2, \\text{cen: }2, \\text{q-arm: }2)$. After replication and a crossover between the centromere and the q-arm marker, the sister chromatids of one homolog are no longer identical.\n-   At the end of meiosis I, due to nondisjunction, both homologous chromosomes (now composed of recombinant chromatids) move to the same secondary spermatocyte.\n-   Meiosis II proceeds, and sister chromatids segregate. One possible resulting sperm can receive one chromatid derived from $P_A$ and one derived from $P_B$. Due to the crossover, while the centromeric regions are still distinct ($1$ vs. $2$), the q-arm telomeric regions can become identical. Specifically, a sperm could be formed containing chromatids with genotypes $(\\text{p: }1, \\text{cen: }1, \\text{q: }2)$ and $(\\text{p: }2, \\text{cen: }2, \\text{q: }2)$. The combined genotype of such a disomic sperm would be $(1/2)$ at $\\mathrm{TEL}\\text{-}\\mathrm{p}15$, $(1/2)$ at $\\mathrm{CEN}\\text{-}15$, and $(2/2)$ at $\\mathrm{TEL}\\text{-}\\mathrm{q}15$. This precisely matches the paternal contribution to the proband.\n-   This disomic $(n+1)$ sperm fertilizes a normal, euploid egg $(n)$, which contains one maternal chromosome $15$.\n-   The resulting zygote is trisomic for chromosome $15$, having two paternal copies and one maternal copy.\n-   For the proband to have pUPD$15$ and not trisomy $15$, a postzygotic event called **trisomy rescue** must occur, wherein one of the three chromosomes $15$ is lost. In this case, the maternal chromosome $15$ is lost, leaving the two paternal chromosomes.\n\nThis sequence of events—paternal meiosis I nondisjunction with a crossover, followed by trisomy rescue—parsimoniously explains all the genetic data.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Paternal meiosis I nondisjunction producing a disomic sperm, followed by trisomy rescue with loss of the maternal chromosome $15$.**\nThis mechanism is fully consistent with our derivation. It correctly predicts heterodisomy at the centromere due to the meiosis I error, and it allows for regions of isodisomy (like at $\\mathrm{TEL}\\text{-}\\mathrm{q}15$) due to a crossover event. The subsequent steps of fertilization and trisomy rescue are necessary to arrive at the final pUPD state.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Paternal meiosis II nondisjunction producing a disomic sperm, followed by trisomy rescue with loss of the maternal chromosome $15$.**\nA meiosis II nondisjunction involves the failure of sister chromatids to separate. This would result in isodisomy for the centromere and all loci proximal to any crossover event. The proband's data shows heterodisomy at the centromere ($\\mathrm{CEN}\\text{-}15$). Therefore, this mechanism is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Maternal meiosis II nondisjunction producing a nullisomic egg, followed by monosomy rescue via duplication of the paternal chromosome $15$.**\nThis mechanism, known as gamete complementation followed by monosomy rescue, starts with a normal haploid sperm fertilizing a nullisomic egg. The resulting monosomic zygote must duplicate its single paternal chromosome to survive. This duplication event would create two identical copies of the paternal chromosome. The result would be **complete paternal isodisomy** across the entire chromosome. This contradicts the observed heterodisomy at the $\\mathrm{CEN}\\text{-}15$ and $\\mathrm{TEL}\\text{-}\\mathrm{p}15$ loci.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Postzygotic mitotic nondisjunction in a normal zygote producing paternal isodisomy of chromosome $15$ without any meiotic error.**\nThis mechanism starts with a normal zygote. A mitotic error (e.g., nondisjunction followed by loss of the maternal chromosome) leads to a cell line with two copies of the paternal chromosome $15$. Since these two copies originate from the duplication of a single paternal chromosome during a mitotic S-phase, they are identical. This mechanism results in **complete paternal isodisomy**, which is contradicted by the observed heterodisomy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2839302"}]}
