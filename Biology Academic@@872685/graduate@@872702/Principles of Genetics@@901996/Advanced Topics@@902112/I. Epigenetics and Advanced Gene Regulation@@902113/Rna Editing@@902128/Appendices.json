This first exercise [@problem_id:1518563] explores the most direct consequence of this process: its ability to alter the protein-coding message of an mRNA. By tracing the effect of a single C-to-U editing event on a codon, you will see how this modification can lead to a dramatic change in the resulting polypeptide, such as the creation of a premature stop signal.", "problem": "In certain eukaryotic organisms, a post-transcriptional modification process known as RNA editing can alter the sequence of an mRNA molecule. One common type is Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) editing, where a cytidine (C) nucleotide in the RNA is enzymatically converted to a uridine (U).\n\nConsider a hypothetical gene whose mRNA transcript contains the codon `5'-CGA-3'` at a critical position. During protein synthesis, this unedited codon is translated into an amino acid. However, if a C-to-U editing event occurs at the first position of this specific codon, it results in a non-synonymous change in the polypeptide chain.\n\nGiven the following partial genetic code table where codons are written 5' to 3':\n- `CGA`: Arginine\n- `UGG`: Tryptophan\n- `CUA`: Leucine\n- `UGA`: Stop\n\nWhat is the specific consequence of this C-to-U editing event at the first position of the `CGA` codon on the resulting polypeptide?\n\nA. A synonymous change, where the codon still codes for Arginine.\n\nB. A non-synonymous change, resulting in the incorporation of a Tryptophan residue.\n\nC. A non-synonymous change, resulting in the incorporation of a Leucine residue.\n\nD. A non-synonymous change, leading to premature termination of translation.\n\nE. A frameshift mutation, altering the entire downstream amino acid sequence.", "solution": "The problem asks for the consequence of a specific RNA editing event on protein synthesis. We can determine the outcome by following these steps.\n\nStep 1: Identify the original mRNA codon and the amino acid it codes for.\nThe problem states that the original codon in the mRNA sequence is `5'-CGA-3'`. According to the provided genetic code table, the codon `CGA` codes for the amino acid Arginine.\n\nStep 2: Determine the change that occurs due to RNA editing.\nThe editing process is described as Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) editing at the first position of the codon. This means the first base, Cytidine (C), is converted into Uridine (U).\n\nStep 3: Determine the new codon after the editing event.\nThe original codon is `CGA`. Changing the first base from C to U results in the new codon `5'-UGA-3'`.\n\nStep 4: Determine the meaning of the new, edited codon.\nWe refer to the provided genetic code table to find what the `UGA` codon specifies. The table indicates that `UGA` is a stop codon.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the consequence of the change from an amino acid-coding codon to a stop codon.\nThe original codon `CGA` would have led to the incorporation of an Arginine amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain. The new codon `UGA` is a termination signal. When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it does not incorporate an amino acid; instead, it releases the polypeptide chain, terminating the process of translation. This leads to a truncated (shortened) protein, which is almost always non-functional. This type of mutation, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon, is called a nonsense mutation.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n- Option A is incorrect. The change is from Arginine to a stop signal, which is a non-synonymous change, not a synonymous one.\n- Option B is incorrect. The edited codon is `UGA`, not `UGG` (which codes for Tryptophan).\n- Option C is incorrect. The edited codon is `UGA`, not `CUA` (which codes for Leucine).\n- Option D is correct. The change from an Arginine codon (`CGA`) to a stop codon (`UGA`) results in premature termination of translation. This is a type of non-synonymous change.\n- Option E is incorrect. A frameshift mutation is caused by the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which shifts the reading frame. This event is a single-base substitution, which does not cause a frameshift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1518563"}, {"introduction": "RNA editing within a cell rarely occurs with 100% efficiency, leading to a mixed population of edited and unedited transcripts. This exercise [@problem_id:1518594] challenges you to think quantitatively about the downstream effects of this partial editing. You will model how the efficiency of an edit that inactivates a protein monomer impacts the overall proportion of functional protein complexes, demonstrating a key link between molecular stoichiometry and cellular function.", "problem": "In the study of post-transcriptional gene regulation, a specific protein, which we will call Dimer-Dependent Kinase Regulator (DDKR), is found to be crucial for a cellular signaling pathway. The DDKR protein is only active when it forms a homodimer, a complex made of two identical DDKR protein units. The gene for DDKR undergoes a specific and well-characterized messenger RNA (mRNA) editing event where a single nucleotide is altered. This editing event produces a variant of the DDKR protein monomer that is completely non-functional, as it cannot bind to its target or form a stable dimer interface.\n\nExtensive sequencing has determined that this RNA editing process has an efficiency of 60.0%. This means that in the cellular pool of DDKR mRNA transcripts, 60.0% are edited, and the remaining are unedited. Assume that the protein monomers (both functional from unedited mRNA and non-functional from edited mRNA) are synthesized in direct proportion to the abundance of their respective transcripts and that they combine randomly to form dimers.\n\nCalculate the proportion of DDKR protein complexes that are fully functional within the cell. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the fraction of edited (nonfunctional) transcripts be $f_{e}=0.600$. Because protein synthesis is proportional to transcript abundance, the fraction of nonfunctional monomers is also $f_{e}=0.600$. The fraction of unedited (functional) monomers is therefore\n$$\nf_{u}=1-f_{e}=1-0.600=0.400.\n$$\nAssuming random combination into dimers, selecting the two monomers is independent. The possible pairings and their probabilities are $f_{u}^{2}$ (unedited–unedited), $2f_{u}f_{e}$ (heterodimer), and $f_{e}^{2}$ (edited–edited). Only the unedited–unedited dimer is fully functional. Hence, the proportion of fully functional dimers in the cellular pool is\n$$\nf_{\\text{functional}}=f_{u}^{2}=(0.400)^{2}=0.160.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this remains $0.160$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.160}$$", "id": "1518594"}, {"introduction": "In the era of high-throughput sequencing, a central challenge is distinguishing dynamic RNA modifications from static genomic variants like Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).

You will use a chi-squared statistical test to evaluate whether an observed excess of 'G' alleles in RNA-seq data, compared to DNA-seq, provides significant evidence for an A-to-I editing event.", "problem": "In the study of gene expression, a key process is RNA editing, where the nucleotide sequence of a Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) transcript is altered after transcription. A common type is A-to-I editing, where an adenosine (A) is converted to inosine (I), which is then interpreted as guanine (G) by sequencing technologies and the translational machinery. A significant challenge in genomics is to distinguish these post-transcriptional editing events from true genomic variations, such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), which are differences in the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence itself.\n\nA researcher is investigating a candidate site for A-to-I editing in a human gene using data from a single tissue sample. They have aligned reads from both whole-genome DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) and stranded RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to the human reference genome. At the specific genomic coordinate of interest, the reference allele is 'A'. The read counts supporting the reference 'A' allele and the alternative 'G' allele are summarized as follows:\n\n- From DNA-seq: 98 reads support the 'A' allele, and 2 reads support the 'G' allele.\n- From stranded RNA-seq (mapped to the expressed strand): 140 reads support the 'A' allele, and 60 reads support the 'G' allele.\n\nTo statistically assess whether the enrichment of 'G' in the RNA-seq data is significant enough to be classified as an editing event rather than a low-frequency somatic SNP or sequencing noise, a chi-squared test of homogeneity is performed. The null hypothesis for this test is that the proportion of 'G' alleles is the same in the underlying molecule populations from which the DNA and RNA reads were sampled.\n\nCalculate the chi-squared test statistic for this data.
