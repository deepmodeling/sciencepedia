In the wild-type transcript, the annotated start codon is at the first nucleotide of exon $1$ and the annotated stop codon is within exon $5$. A nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon in exon $3$; within exon $3$, the three nucleotides of this stop codon occupy positions $150$–$152$ when counting from the $5'$ end of exon $3$ (i.e., the last nucleotide of the premature stop codon is position $152$ of exon $3$).

All necessary information to calculate the required distance and apply the NMD rule is present. The placement of the PTC in an internal exon upstream of the final exon junction is a valid scenario for NMD analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be formulated.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe problem has two parts: first, to calculate a specific distance, $d$, on the mature mRNA, and second, to use this distance to predict the occurrence of NMD.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance $d$. This distance is defined as the number of nucleotides from the last nucleotide of the premature stop codon (PTC) to the final exon–exon junction. The sequence of interest lies between the PTC in exon $3$ and the junction between exon $4$ and exon $5$.\n\nThe PTC is located at positions $150$, $151$, and $152$ within exon $3$. The last nucleotide of the PTC is therefore at position $152$ relative to the start of exon $3$.\nExon $3$ has a total length of $L_3 = 200$ nucleotides. The number of nucleotides remaining in exon $3$ downstream of the PTC's final nucleotide is:\n$$ N_{3, \\text{downstream}} = L_3 - 152 = 200 - 152 = 48 \\text{ nucleotides} $$\n\nThe full length of exon $4$ lies between exon $3$ and the final exon-exon junction (the junction between exon $4$ and exon $5$). The length of exon $4$ is given as $L_4 = 160$ nucleotides.\n\nThe total distance $d$ is the sum of the remaining part of exon $3$ and the entire length of exon $4$.\n$$ d = N_{3, \\text{downstream}} + L_4 $$\n$$ d = 48 + 160 = 208 \\text{ nucleotides} $$\nThis is the distance in nucleotides from the last base of the PTC to the splice junction between exon $4$ and exon $5$.\n\nSecond, we determine if this transcript is a predicted target for NMD. The NMD pathway identifies and degrades mRNAs containing PTCs. The key mechanism involves the deposition of Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs) on the mRNA after splicing.\n\n**Assumption:** A core assumption is that an EJC is deposited in its canonical position, which is approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of each exon-exon splice junction. For this problem, the critical EJC is the one deposited upstream of the final junction, i.e., within exon $4$ at a position approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides $5'$ to the exon $4$-exon $5$ boundary.\n\nThe NMD machinery is triggered when a translating ribosome terminates at a PTC but leaves at least one EJC downstream. The \"classical $50$–$55$ nucleotide rule\" is an empirical generalization of this principle. It states that if a PTC is located more than $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of a downstream exon-exon junction, NMD will be triggered. This critical distance accounts for the space occupied by the EJC itself (so it is not sterically occluded) and the footprint of the terminating ribosome, allowing for the stable recruitment of UPF proteins (the core NMD factors) to the EJC-ribosome complex.\n\nWe compare our calculated distance $d$ to this threshold.\n$$ d = 208 \\text{ nucleotides} $$\nThe threshold for NMD activation is approximately $50$–$55$ nucleotides.\nSince $d = 208$ is substantially greater than $55$ ($208 > 55$), the PTC is located far upstream of the final exon–exon junction. The EJC deposited at the exon $4$-exon $5$ junction will remain on the mRNA after the ribosome terminates at the PTC in exon $3$. This configuration is the canonical signal for NMD.\n\nTherefore, according to the $50$–$55$ nucleotide rule and the standard model of EJC-dependent NMD, this mRNA transcript would be predicted to be a target for degradation by the NMD pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{208}$$", "id": "2833286"}, {"introduction": "Moving from prediction to experimentation, a key skill in molecular biology is the design of reporter constructs to probe cellular pathways.

The human beta-globin locus naturally comprises $3$ exons separated by $2$ introns and produces a messenger RNA (mRNA) with a translation termination codon in the last exon under normal circumstances. During pre-mRNA splicing, an Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of each exon–exon junction. During the pioneer round of translation, ribosomes displace EJCs they traverse; any EJC that remains downstream (in the $3'$ direction) of a terminating ribosome can recruit NMD factors.

A PTC in the last exon is typically ineffective unless an additional downstream exon–exon junction exists in the $3'$ untranslated region (UTR).\n- **Design Requirement**: The selected construct(s) must robustly elicit EJC-dependent NMD and the PTC must satisfy the \"canonical distance requirement\" relative to the nearest downstream exon–exon junction.\n- **Assumptions**: Use of native human beta-globin sequences unless specified; intact splicing and NMD cellular machinery.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem statement accurately describes the canonical mechanism of EJC-dependent NMD.

The well-known \"50-55 nucleotide rule,\" which states that a PTC must be at least $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of a downstream exon–exon junction to trigger NMD, is implicitly referenced by the phrases \"sufficiently upstream\" and \"canonical distance requirement\".\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question is well-posed. It provides a set of rules and a series of constructs, asking for an evaluation of each construct against these rules.

There are no identifiable flaws. It represents a valid problem in molecular genetics. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core principle for canonical EJC-dependent NMD is as follows: a messenger RNA (mRNA) will be targeted for degradation if translation terminates at a premature termination codon (PTC) that is located a sufficient distance upstream of a splice-site-generated exon-exon junction. This distance ensures that the exon junction complex (EJC), which is deposited $\\approx 20-24$ nucleotides upstream of the junction, is not displaced by the terminating ribosome. The established canonical distance is greater than approximately $50$–$55$ nucleotides between the PTC and the exon-exon junction.\n\nI will now evaluate each of the given options against this principle.\n\n**A. Genomic minigene with the native $3$-exon, $2$-intron structure; introduce a UAG premature termination codon in exon $2$ located $60$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $2$–exon $3$ junction.**\nThis construct is based on a genomic template containing introns, so pre-mRNA splicing will occur. Splicing will create an exon $2$–exon $3$ junction and deposit an EJC upstream of it. The PTC is located in exon $2$. Consequently, the ribosome will terminate translation within exon $2$. The distance from the PTC to the downstream exon $2$–exon $3$ junction is given as $60$ nucleotides. This distance is greater than the canonical threshold of $\\approx 50$–$55$ nucleotides required to trigger NMD. The EJC associated with the downstream junction will therefore remain on the mRNA after termination and recruit NMD factors. This design correctly and robustly engineers a substrate for EJC-dependent NMD.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Intronless complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding beta-globin (no introns, hence no exon–exon junctions in the mature transcript); introduce a UAG premature termination codon at the position corresponding to $60$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $2$–exon $3$ junction in the genomic reference.**\nThis construct is derived from a cDNA, which by definition lacks introns. Transcription of a cDNA template produces a pre-mRNA that does not undergo splicing. EJC deposition is a consequence of splicing. In the absence of splicing, no exon-exon junctions are created, and thus no EJCs are deposited onto the mRNA. The problem specifically asks to assay for *EJC-dependent* NMD. As this construct produces an mRNA devoid of EJCs, it cannot be a substrate for the EJC-dependent NMD pathway, regardless of the PTC's location.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Genomic minigene with the native $3$-exon, $2$-intron structure; introduce a UAG premature termination codon in exon $3$ located $80$ nucleotides downstream of the exon $2$–exon $3$ junction (i.e., within the last exon).**\nThis construct is a genomic minigene, so splicing will occur, placing EJCs upstream of the exon $1$–exon $2$ and exon $2$–exon $3$ junctions. The PTC is located in exon $3$, the final exon in this native configuration. During the pioneer round of translation, the ribosome will traverse exons $1$ and $2$, C thereby displacing the EJCs associated with both junctions. Translation will then terminate at the PTC in exon $3$. At the point of termination, there are no exon-exon junctions, and hence no EJCs, located downstream of the ribosome. As stated in the problem, \"a PTC in the last exon typically does not [elicit NMD]\". This construct conforms to that rule.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Genomic minigene in which a single synthetic intron is inserted into the $3'$ untranslated region downstream of the normal beta-globin stop codon, creating one additional exon–exon junction within the $3'$ untranslated region; introduce a UAG premature termination codon in exon $3$ positioned $80$ nucleotides upstream of this engineered $3'$ untranslated region exon–exon junction.**\nThis construct modifies the native gene by inserting an intron into the $3'$ UTR. The result is a gene that, after splicing, produces an mRNA with an additional exon-exon junction located within the $3'$ UTR. The PTC is introduced in exon $3$. During translation, the ribosome will terminate at this PTC. Crucially, there is now an exon-exon junction (and its associated EJC) downstream of this termination event. The distance between the PTC and this new junction is specified as $80$ nucleotides. This distance is well above the $\\approx 50$–$55$ nucleotide threshold. The EJC in the $3'$ UTR will not be displaced and will successfully trigger NMD. This design is a classic experimental strategy to demonstrate the NMD mechanism and fulfills the exception noted in the problem statement.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Genomic minigene with the native $3$-exon, $2$-intron structure; introduce a UAG premature termination codon in exon $2$ located $30$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $2$–exon $3$ junction.**\nAs in option A, this genomic construct will produce a spliced mRNA with an EJC upstream of the exon $2$-exon $3$ junction. However, the PTC in exon $2$ is positioned only $30$ nucleotides upstream of the junction. This distance is significantly less than the canonical requirement of $\\approx 50$–$55$ nucleotides. The terminating ribosome possesses a physical footprint and likely surveys a short region downstream of the stop codon. A distance of only $30$ nucleotides is generally insufficient to prevent the ribosome from interacting with and displacing the downstream EJC. Therefore, this construct would not \"robustly elicit\" NMD as required.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2833317"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the canonical EJC-dependent model, NMD is also regulated by the proximity of the termination event to the poly(A) tail, an interaction mediated by the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1.

The description of NMD reflects current, established models, particularly the \"faux 3' UTR\" model, which posits that the distance between a PTC and PABPC1 is a key determinant for NMD activation. The roles of EJCs, PABPC1, eRF$3$, and UPF$1$ are described correctly. The hypothesis is a logical extension of these models and is directly testable using standard molecular biology techniques such as reporter assays and protein tethering systems. The problem is objective, free of contradictions, and provides sufficient information to evaluate the proposed experimental designs. It is not trivial, as it requires a nuanced understanding of experimental controls and appropriate quantitative readouts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a detailed analysis of each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\nTo test the hypothesis, a sound experimental design must possess the following features:\n1.  **An NMD-sensitive reporter:** The messenger RNA (mRNA) must contain a PTC and be a bona fide target for NMD. This is typically achieved by ensuring an exon junction complex (EJC) is present downstream of the PTC (usually at a distance greater than $50-55$ nucleotides) or by having a very long $3'$ untranslated region ($3'$ UTR).\n2.  **A controllable, position-variable tethering system:** A system is needed to place PABPC1 at specific, defined distances ($d$) from the PTC. RNA hairpin-loop/RNA-binding protein systems like MS$2$/MCP or BoxB/λN are ideal for this purpose.\n3.  **Comprehensive and specific controls:** To ensure observed effects are due to the intended mechanism, several controls are critical:\n    *   A control for the tethering machinery itself (e.g., expressing the RNA-binding protein domain alone).\n    *   A control for the specific protein being tethered (e.g., comparing tethered PABPC1 to overexpression of untethered PABPC1).\n    *   A mechanistic control testing the specific protein-protein interaction of the hypothesis (e.g., tethering a PABPC1 mutant unable to bind eRF$3$).\n4.  **Direct and quantitative readouts:** NMD affects mRNA stability. Therefore, a direct measurement of mRNA half-life (e.g., via transcriptional shutoff or pulse-chase labeling) and/or steady-state mRNA abundance (e.g., via reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RT–qPCR) is required. Relying solely on protein-level readouts (e.g., fluorescence, enzymatic activity) is insufficient, as these can be confounded by effects on translation efficiency.\n5.  **Correct Normalization:** An internal control reporter must be co-expressed to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency and cell state.\n6.  **A logical prediction:** The expected outcome must be consistent with the mechanistic model being tested. Here, NMD suppression should be maximal at the smallest distance $d$ and decay as $d$ increases.\n\nNow, let us evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**A. Construct a Firefly luciferase reporter...**\n- **Reporter and NMD competence:** A luciferase reporter with a PTC in exon $1$ and a downstream exon-exon junction ($>50$ nt) is a canonical NMD substrate. This is correct.\n- **Tethering System:** An array of $6 \\times$ MS$2$ hairpins placed at defined distances ($+12$, $+24$, $+48$, $+96$ nt) downstream of the PTC, combined with co-expression of an MCP–PABPC1 fusion protein, is a standard and precise method for testing distance-dependence. This is correct.\n- **Controls:** This option includes an excellent set of controls: MCP alone (controls for tethering effect), untethered PABPC1 (controls for overexpression), and an MCP–PABPC1 mutant defective in eRF$3$ interaction (the crucial mechanistic control). This is exemplary.\n- **Readouts:** Both steady-state mRNA abundance (RT–qPCR) and mRNA half-life (transcriptional shutoff) are measured. These are the most direct and rigorous readouts for NMD. Normalization to a co-transfected Renilla luciferase is also correct.\n- **Prediction:** The prediction that NMD suppression is strongest at $d = +12$ and decays with increasing $d$, and is abolished by the eRF$3$-interaction mutant, is precisely what the hypothesis dictates.\n- **Verdict:** This option describes a scientifically rigorous, well-controlled, and comprehensive experiment that directly tests the hypothesis. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Insert $6 \\times$ MS$2$ hairpins into the coding region...**\n- **Tethering System:** Hairpins are placed *upstream* of the PTC. This is a fundamental design flaw. The critical interaction between PABPC1 and the termination complex (containing eRF$1$/eRF$3$) occurs at the PTC where the ribosome stalls. Tethering PABPC1 upstream means it is spatially distant from the site of action at the moment of termination. The stated rationale, that the \"ribosome will have more time to engage PABPC1,\" is mechanistically nonsensical.\n- **Reporter and NMD competence:** The omission of downstream introns and EJCs removes a major NMD-inducing signal, weakening the assay's sensitivity and deviating from the canonical NMD model.\n- **Readouts:** Measuring only GFP fluorescence is insufficient. It is an indirect measure of mRNA levels and is highly susceptible to confounding effects on translation initiation or elongation, which the hairpins in the coding sequence could easily cause.\n- **Prediction:** The prediction is based on the flawed rationale and is thus incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** This option is flawed in its core design (upstream tethering), lacks a key NMD signal, uses an inadequate readout, and is based on faulty reasoning. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use a luciferase reporter with a PTC but do not tether PABPC1...**\n- **Experimental Design:** This experiment varies poly(A) tail length, not the position of a tethered protein. While poly(A) tail length and PABPC1 abundance are related to NMD, this design does not directly test the central hypothesis about the *spatial proximity* of PABPC1 to the PTC in a controlled, distance-dependent manner ($d$). It conflates PABPC1 amount with position.\n- **Readouts:** Measuring only steady-state luciferase activity is, again, an insufficient and indirect readout. Poly(A) tail length is known to strongly influence translation efficiency, so any observed change in protein level cannot be unambiguously attributed to NMD suppression.\n- **Interpretation:** The conclusion that \"any increase reflects NMD suppression\" is a gross oversimplification that ignores the pleiotropic effects of poly(A) tail length on mRNA metabolism.\n- **Verdict:** This option fails to test the distance-dependence hypothesis, uses an inappropriate readout, and proposes a naive interpretation of the data. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Build a dual-reporter system with a PTC-containing Firefly luciferase gene...**\n- **Reporter and NMD competence:** The design correctly uses a reporter with a single intron to deposit an EJC in the $3'$ UTR, ensuring the substrate is NMD-sensitive. The use of a dual-reporter system with Renilla for normalization is standard practice.\n- **Tethering System:** The use of BoxB hairpins and a λN–PABPC1 fusion is another standard tethering system, functionally equivalent to MS$2$/MCP. Placing the hairpins at defined downstream positions ($+10$, $+30$, etc.) allows for a systematic test of distance-dependence.\n- **Controls:** It includes the essential controls: λN alone (tethering control) and a PABPC1 mutant lacking the eRF$3$-binding region (mechanistic control). This is rigorous.\n- **Readouts:** The use of both RT–qPCR (for steady-state levels) and a pulse–chase assay using $4$-thiouridine (for a direct half-life measurement) constitutes a state-of-the-art approach to quantifying mRNA stability.\n- **Prediction:** The prediction of a distance-dependent suppression effect that is lost with the eRF$3$ binding-defective mutant is correct and consistent with the hypothesis.\n- **Verdict:** This option describes an experiment that is methodologically sound, rigorously controlled, and directly addresses the research question. It is conceptually identical to option A, using an alternative but equally valid set of molecular tools. **Correct**.\n\n**E. CRISPR-Cas9-edit an endogenous gene...**\n- **Experimental Design:** While using CRISPR-Cas9 to study an endogenous gene is a powerful approach, this specific design is inadequate for the stated goal. It tests only a single condition (short $3'$ UTR) against a control. It does not allow for a systematic analysis of NMD suppression as a function of multiple, defined distances ($d$), which is the core of the hypothesis. This is an \"all-or-nothing\" experiment, not a titration of distance.\n- **Readouts:** The proposed readout is flawed. Measuring protein by Western blot after treating with cycloheximide is nonsensical. Cycloheximide is a translation elongation inhibitor; it would prevent the very synthesis of the protein being measured. One would typically use a transcriptional inhibitor (like actinomycin D) to measure protein or mRNA decay, not a translational one to measure protein levels. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the technique. Furthermore, relying only on protein level is insufficient.\n- **Verdict:** This design fails to test the distance-dependence of the effect and proposes a nonsensical measurement procedure. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2833324"}]}
