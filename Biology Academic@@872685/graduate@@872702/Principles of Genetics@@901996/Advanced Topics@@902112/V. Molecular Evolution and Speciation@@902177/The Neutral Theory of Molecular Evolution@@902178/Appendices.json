Interpreting these patterns requires synthesizing information from different statistical tests. This advanced problem presents a scenario with seemingly conflicting signals from the McDonald-Kreitman test and Tajima's D statistic, challenging you to develop a coherent evolutionary narrative that can reconcile evidence for both adaptive evolution and a specific demographic history. [@problem_id:1527876]", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying a gene, which they have named *Adapt-1*, in a species of fruit fly, *Drosophila persimilis*. To understand the evolutionary forces acting on this gene, they sequence the *Adapt-1* coding region from a sample of individuals from a specific geographic population. They also compare the *D. persimilis* sequence to that of its closely related sister species, *Drosophila pseudoobscura*.\n\nTheir analysis, using the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test framework, yields the following data:\n-   The number of non-synonymous substitutions between the species ($D_n$) is 40.\n-   The number of synonymous substitutions between the species ($D_s$) is 20.\n-   The number of non-synonymous polymorphisms within *D. persimilis* ($P_n$) is 10.\n-   The number of synonymous polymorphisms within *D. persimilis* ($P_s$) is 25.\n\nFurther analysis of the polymorphism data from the *D. persimilis* population for the *Adapt-1* locus reveals a Tajima's D statistic that is significantly positive ($D = +2.5$).\n\nThe researchers are puzzled by this combination of results. Based on these observations, which of the following scenarios provides the most plausible explanation for the evolutionary history of the *Adapt-1* gene in this *D. persimilis* population?\n\nA. A recent and strong selective sweep has occurred at the *Adapt-1* locus, driving a beneficial allele to fixation.\n\nB. The *Adapt-1* locus has been under long-term balancing selection, maintaining multiple functional alleles in the population.\n\nC. The population of *D. persimilis* has been experiencing long-term, steady exponential growth.\n\nD. The population of *D. persimilis* experienced a severe bottleneck in the recent past, followed by a period of population subdivision into small, isolated demes.\n\nE. The *Adapt-1* gene is functionally critical and has been evolving under strong purifying selection, and the population has recently expanded from a small founding group.", "solution": "We are given McDonald-Kreitman counts for the Adapt-1 coding region: the numbers of fixed differences between species at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, denoted by $D_{n}$ and $D_{s}$, and the numbers of within-species polymorphisms at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, denoted by $P_{n}$ and $P_{s}$. The MK test compares the ratio of divergence at nonsynonymous to synonymous sites to the ratio of polymorphism at nonsynonymous to synonymous sites. Under neutrality, the expectation is\n$$\n\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}} \\approx \\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}.\n$$\nDeviations are interpreted as follows: if $\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}\\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}$, there is an excess of fixed nonsynonymous differences relative to neutral expectation, consistent with recurrent positive selection (adaptive substitutions). Conversely, if $\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}\\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}$, that pattern is consistent with balancing selection or an excess of slightly deleterious nonsynonymous polymorphisms.\n\nUsing the provided counts,\n$$\n\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}=\\frac{40}{20}=2, \\quad \\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}=\\frac{10}{25}=0.4.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}\\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}.\n$$\nA standard summary is the neutrality index,\n$$\n\\mathrm{NI}=\\frac{P_{n}/P_{s}}{D_{n}/D_{s}}=\\frac{0.4}{2}=0.21,\n$$\nand the estimated fraction of nonsynonymous substitutions fixed by positive selection,\n$$\n\\alpha=1-\\mathrm{NI}=1-0.2=0.8,\n$$\nboth indicating a strong excess of adaptive nonsynonymous divergence. Therefore, the MK test supports recurrent positive selection on Adapt-1 along the lineage(s) separating the species.\n\nNext, consider the site-frequency spectrum within D. persimilis at Adapt-1, summarized by Tajima’s $D$. Tajima’s $D$ compares two estimators of the scaled mutation rate: $\\theta_{\\pi}$ (based on average pairwise differences) and $\\theta_{W}$ (based on the number of segregating sites). A significantly positive value, $D0$, indicates an excess of intermediate-frequency variants relative to the standard neutral equilibrium model with constant size and panmixia. Well-known interpretations are:\n- Positive $D$ is consistent with balancing selection at or near the locus, or with demographic processes such as population structure (subdivision) or recent contraction/bottleneck that elevate intermediate-frequency alleles when samples are pooled.\n- Negative $D$ is expected after a recent selective sweep at the locus or after recent population expansion, due to an excess of rare variants.\n\nHere $D=+2.5$ is significantly positive. We now assess each scenario:\n\nA. A recent, strong selective sweep at Adapt-1 would be expected to reduce diversity and yield a negative Tajima’s $D$ locally (excess of rare variants following the sweep). This contradicts the observed $D=+2.5$, so A is inconsistent.\n\nB. Long-term balancing selection can produce $D0$ at the locus. However, balancing selection typically elevates within-species nonsynonymous polymorphism relative to neutral expectations, leading to $\\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}$ being large and often $\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}\\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}$ in an MK table. The data show the opposite pattern, $\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}\\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}$, indicating adaptive divergence rather than balancing selection. Thus B does not match the MK result.\n\nC. Long-term steady exponential growth produces an excess of rare variants and therefore negative Tajima’s $D$, which conflicts with $D=+2.5$. So C is inconsistent.\n\nD. A severe bottleneck followed by subdivision into small, isolated demes can produce a positive Tajima’s $D$ at a locus when sampling across demes (population structure yields an excess of intermediate-frequency variants), and a bottleneck can also elevate intermediate-frequency classes. This demographic scenario reconciles the significantly positive Tajima’s $D$ without requiring balancing selection at the locus. Meanwhile, the MK signal of $\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}\\frac{P_{n}}{P_{s}}$ reflects adaptive nonsynonymous divergence between species; demographic changes generally affect both synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphisms similarly and do not create an excess of fixed nonsynonymous substitutions. Therefore, demography explains the positive Tajima’s $D$, and positive selection explains the MK test outcome. D is consistent with both results.\n\nE. Strong purifying selection on a functionally critical gene, coupled with recent expansion, predicts low $\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}$ (few fixed nonsynonymous changes) and negative Tajima’s $D$ (expansion), both contrary to the observed $\\frac{D_{n}}{D_{s}}=2$ and $D=+2.5$. Thus E is inconsistent.\n\nThe only scenario that accommodates both the MK evidence for adaptive divergence and the significantly positive Tajima’s $D$ at the locus via demography is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1527876"}]}
