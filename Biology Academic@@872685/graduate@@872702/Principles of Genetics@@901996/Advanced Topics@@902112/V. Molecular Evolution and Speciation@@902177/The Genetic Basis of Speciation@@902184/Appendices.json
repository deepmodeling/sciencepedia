The formulation is a common theoretical model used in speciation research. The problem is well-posed, providing explicit, unambiguous definitions for all necessary quantities ($G_P$, $RI$, the multiplicative action of barriers) and the parameters needed for their calculation ($f_X, f_Y, p_{CH}, w_H$). The language is objective and precise. The mathematical constraints are consistent ($p_{CC} + p_{CH} = 1$; $p_{CH} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ correctly frames random mating as the upper bound for heterospecific encounters). The problem is self-contained and does not violate any fundamental principles of mathematics or biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous solution will be developed based on the provided definitions.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe objective is to compute the total Reproductive Isolation, $RI$. The problem defines $RI$ as the proportional reduction in realized interspecific gene flow ($G_R$) relative to the potential interspecific gene flow under a null model ($G_P$). This definition corresponds to the formula:\n$$RI = \\frac{G_P - G_R}{G_P} = 1 - \\frac{G_R}{G_P}$$\n\nWe must first compute $G_P$ and $G_R$.\n\n**1. Potential Interspecific Gene Flow ($G_P$)**\nThe potential flow, $G_P$, is defined as the probability of forming a heterospecific mating under the null model of random mating with no isolation. Given two species, $X$ and $Y$, with frequencies $f_X$ and $f_Y$, the probability of a mating between an individual of species $X$ and an individual of species $Y$ under random mating is the sum of the probabilities of the two possible heterospecific pairings ($X \\times Y$ and $Y \\times X$).\n$$G_P = f_X f_Y + f_Y f_X = 2 f_X f_Y$$\nThe problem states that the species are at equal frequencies, $f_X = f_Y = \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting these values:\n$$G_P = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis is the baseline level of interspecific gene flow against which isolation is measured.\n\n**2. Realized Interspecific Gene Flow ($G_R$)**\nThe realized flow, $G_R$, is the potential flow, $G_P$, after being reduced by the existing barriers to gene flow. The problem specifies two barriers acting sequentially and independently: assortative mating (prezygotic) and reduced hybrid fitness (postzygotic). Their effect is a multiplicative reduction of gene flow.\n\nLet $L_{total}$ be the total \"leakage,\" which is the proportion of potential gene flow that successfully passes through all barriers. Then $G_R = G_P \\times L_{total}$. The total leakage is the product of the leakages of individual barriers: $L_{total} = L_{pre} \\times L_{post}$.\n\n**a. Prezygotic Barrier Leakage ($L_{pre}$)**\nThis barrier is assortative mating. The potential proportion of matings that are heterospecific is $G_P = \\frac{1}{2}$. The problem states that due to assortative mating, the actual probability of a heterospecific pairing is $p_{CH}$. The leakage of the prezygotic barrier is the ratio of the actual rate of heterospecific mating to the potential rate:\n$$L_{pre} = \\frac{\\text{Actual heterospecific mating rate}}{\\text{Potential heterospecific mating rate}} = \\frac{p_{CH}}{G_P} = \\frac{p_{CH}}{1/2} = 2 p_{CH}$$\n\n**b. Postzygotic Barrier Leakage ($L_{post}$)**\nThis barrier is the reduced fitness of hybrids. It acts on the zygotes formed from heterospecific matings. The relative fitness of hybrids is given as $w_H$. This value, by definition, represents the proportion of the genetic contribution from hybrid offspring that successfully enters the next generation, relative to conspecific offspring. Therefore, the leakage of the postzygotic barrier is simply the relative fitness of the hybrids:\n$$L_{post} = w_H$$\n\n**c. Total Leakage and Realized Flow**\nThe total leakage is the product of the individual leakages:\n$$L_{total} = L_{pre} \\times L_{post} = (2 p_{CH}) w_H = 2 p_{CH} w_H$$\nNow, we can compute the realized interspecific gene flow:\n$$G_R = G_P \\times L_{total} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2 p_{CH} w_H) = p_{CH} w_H$$\n\n**3. Total Reproductive Isolation ($RI$)**\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $G_P$ and $G_R$ into the definition of $RI$:\n$$RI = 1 - \\frac{G_R}{G_P} = 1 - \\frac{p_{CH} w_H}{1/2}$$\n$$RI = 1 - 2 p_{CH} w_H$$\nThis expression is in terms of the specified variables, including $p_{CH}$ and $w_H$. The variable $p_{CC}$ is related by $p_{CC} = 1 - p_{CH}$ but is not required for the most compact form of the answer.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to find the expected proportion of total hybrid sterility attributable to X-linked loci, denoted by $p_X$. By definition, this proportion is the ratio of the expected sterility contribution from the X-chromosome to the total expected sterility.\n\nLet $S_X$ be the total sterility effect from X-linked loci and $S_A$ be the total sterility effect from autosomal loci. The total sterility is $S_{total} = S_X + S_A$.\nThe problem asks for an expected proportion, which is defined as:\n$$p_X = \\frac{E[S_X]}{E[S_{total}]}$$\nThe assumption of additivity of per-locus effects allows us to use the linearity of expectation, such that $E[S_{total}] = E[S_X + S_A] = E[S_X] + E[S_A]$.\nTherefore, the expression for $p_X$ is:\n$$p_X = \\frac{E[S_X]}{E[S_X] + E[S_A]}$$\n\nWe must now determine the expressions for $E[S_X]$ and $E[S_A]$. Let $C$ be a constant of proportionality representing the total density of sterility-related loci across the genome. The problem states that the expected number of loci is proportional to the size of the genomic regions.\nThe expected number of X-linked loci is $C f_X$.\nThe expected number of autosomal loci is $C (1 - f_X)$.\n\nFirst, let us calculate the expected sterility from X-linked loci, $E[S_X]$.\nThe sterility effect of each X-linked locus is fully expressed in the heterogametic sex due to hemizygosity. The problem states that the homozygous sterility effect sizes for these loci are drawn from a distribution with mean $\\mu_X$. Thus, the expected sterility contribution of a single X-linked locus is $\\mu_X$.\nBy the linearity of expectation, the total expected sterility from all X-linked loci is the product of the expected number of such loci and the expected effect per locus:\n$$E[S_X] = (\\text{Expected number of X-loci}) \\times (\\text{Expected effect per X-locus})$$\n$$E[S_X] = (C f_X) \\mu_X$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected sterility from autosomal loci, $E[S_A]$.\nThe homozygous effect sizes for autosomal loci are drawn from a distribution with mean $\\mu_A$.
