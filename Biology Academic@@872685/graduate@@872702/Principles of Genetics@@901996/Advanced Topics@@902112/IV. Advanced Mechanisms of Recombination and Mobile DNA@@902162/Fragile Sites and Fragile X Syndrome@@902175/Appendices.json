This first practice grounds our study of Fragile X syndrome in the foundational principles of population genetics.

Assume a large, randomly mating population at equilibrium satisfying Hardy–Weinberg assumptions: no selection, mutation, migration, or assortative mating, and equal allele frequencies across sexes at equilibrium for an X-linked locus. Let the population be such that the observed prevalence of premutation among males is $1$ in $400$. For the purpose of this calculation, define a female \"premutation carrier\" as any female with at least one premutation allele on one of her two X chromosomes.\n\nUsing only the Hardy–Weinberg framework for an X-linked locus and the fact that males are hemizygous for the X chromosome, derive from first principles the expected prevalence of female premutation carriers in this population and compute its value from the given male prevalence.\n\nExpress the final prevalence as a decimal fraction (not as a percentage) and round your answer to four significant figures.

It is therefore valid. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $p$ represent the frequency of the premutation allele for the *FMR1* gene in the population's gene pool. Let $q$ represent the frequency of the normal, or non-premutation, allele. Assuming these are the only two alleles under consideration at this locus, their frequencies must sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nThe problem is set in the context of an X-linked locus. Males are hemizygous for the X chromosome, possessing only a single copy. Therefore, under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium where allele frequencies are equal in both sexes, the frequency of a given phenotype in males is directly equal to the frequency of the corresponding allele in the gene pool.\n\nThe prevalence of premutation males is given as $1$ in $400$. This directly provides the frequency of the premutation allele, $p$.\n$$p = \\frac{1}{400} = 0.0025$$\n\nUsing this value, we can immediately calculate the frequency of the normal allele, $q$:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.0025 = 0.9975$$\n\nFemales are diploid for the X chromosome. At Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies in females are determined by the random combination of alleles, following the binomial expansion $(p+q)^2 = 1$. The frequencies for the three possible female genotypes are:\n1.  Homozygous for the premutation allele ($X^pX^p$): frequency = $p^2$\n2.  Heterozygous, with one premutation and one normal allele ($X^pX^n$): frequency = $2pq$\n3.  Homozygous for the normal allele ($X^nX^n$): frequency = $q^2$\n\nThe problem defines a female \"premutation carrier\" as any female with at least one premutation allele. This definition encompasses both homozygous premutation females (frequency $p^2$) and heterozygous females (frequency $2pq$). The total expected prevalence of female premutation carriers is the sum of these two frequencies:\n$$\\text{Prevalence of female carriers} = p^2 + 2pq$$\n\nAn equivalent and algebraically simpler method is to calculate the frequency of females who are *not* carriers and subtract this value from $1$. The only non-carrier genotype is homozygous normal ($X^nX^n$), which has a frequency of $q^2$.\n$$\\text{Prevalence of female carriers} = 1 - (\\text{frequency of non-carriers}) = 1 - q^2$$\nWe can confirm the equivalence of these two expressions: $p^2 + 2pq = p(p+2q) = p(1+q)$. And since $p=1-q$, this is $(1-q)(1+q) = 1-q^2$. The expressions are identical.\n\nWe will now compute the numerical value using the second, more direct formula.\n$$\\text{Prevalence of female carriers} = 1 - q^2 = 1 - (0.9975)^2$$\nCalculating the square of $q$:\n$$(0.9975)^2 = 0.99500625$$\nSubstituting this back into the prevalence equation:\n$$\\text{Prevalence of female carriers} = 1 - 0.99500625 = 0.00499375$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.00499375$. The first significant figure is $4$, followed by $9$, $9$, and $3$.

This exercise moves from population-level statistics to individual-level molecular analysis, challenging you to interpret quantitative data from a methylation-sensitive assay. You will learn how to account for experimental limitations, such as incomplete enzyme digestion, to accurately determine the degree of methylation mosaicism and predict its functional impact on FMR1 gene expression.", "problem": "A male patient suspected of Fragile X syndrome (full mutation at the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (*FMR1*) locus on fragile site FRAXA) is evaluated by methylation-sensitive Southern blot using the restriction enzyme HpaII, which cleaves at unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites but not at methylated CpG sites. Assume the following fundamental facts: (i) *FMR1* transcription is largely silenced when the *FMR1* promoter region is methylated, (ii) Southern blot band intensity is proportional to the amount of DNA in that band, and (iii) incomplete digestion by the restriction enzyme can occur, characterized by an empirical digestion efficiency for unmethylated DNA that is less than perfect. Also assume that, in this male, any unmethylated full-mutation allele produces FMR1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) at a constant fractional rate $\\rho$ relative to a normal unmethylated allele due to repeat-length–dependent promoter inefficiency (an empirical calibration constant provided below).\n\nTwo lanes are available for quantitative interpretation (background-subtracted and normalized within each lane so that the sum of all band intensities in the lane equals $1$):\n\n- Calibration lane: normal male control (unmethylated *FMR1* promoter), digested with HpaII. The measured intensities are: digested fragments (low-molecular-weight smear), $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = 0.928$; residual undigested band, $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}} = 0.072$.\n\n- Patient lane: male with full mutation mosaicism, digested with HpaII. The measured intensities are: digested fragments, $I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = 0.2784$; undigested high-molecular-weight band, $I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{undig}} = 0.7216$.\n\nUse the calibration lane to infer the effective digestion efficiency for unmethylated DNA in this experiment. Then, using the patient lane, infer the fraction of the patient’s full-mutation alleles that are unmethylated. Finally, apply the empirical calibration that each unmethylated full-mutation allele yields only a fraction $\\rho = 0.62$ of the FMR1 mRNA produced by a normal unmethylated allele, to predict the patient’s residual FMR1 expression as a fraction of normal.\n\nReport only the predicted residual FMR1 expression relative to normal as a single decimal number. Round your answer to four significant figures. No units are required (dimensionless fraction).", "solution": "The problem is to determine the residual FMR1 gene expression in a male patient with Fragile X full mutation mosaicism, relative to a normal individual. The reasoning proceeds in three steps: first, determining the experimental digestion efficiency from a control sample; second, using this efficiency to calculate the fraction of unmethylated alleles in the patient; and third, calculating the patient's gene expression based on this fraction and a given transcriptional-inefficiency factor.\n\nStep 1: Determination of HpaII Digestion Efficiency ($E$)\nThe calibration lane uses DNA from a normal male control, whose *FMR1* promoter is entirely unmethylated. The restriction enzyme HpaII cleaves unmethylated CpG sites. Therefore, all DNA in this sample is, in principle, susceptible to digestion. The intensity of a band is proportional to the amount of DNA. The data is normalized such that the sum of intensities in a lane is $1$.\n\nThe effective digestion efficiency, denoted as $E$, is the fraction of susceptible DNA that is successfully cleaved. In the control lane, all DNA is susceptible, so $E$ is simply the fraction of total DNA found in the digested fragments. This corresponds to the measured intensity $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{dig}}$.\n$$E = I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{dig}}$$\nThe fraction of DNA that remains undigested despite being unmethylated corresponds to the intensity of the undigested band, $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}}$. This fraction is equal to $1 - E$.\n$$1 - E = I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}}$$\nUsing the provided data for the calibration lane, $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = 0.928$ and $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}} = 0.072$.\nFrom the first equation, we find the efficiency:\n$$E = 0.928$$\nThis value is consistent with the second equation, as $1 - 0.928 = 0.072$, which matches the given $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}}$.\n\nStep 2: Calculation of the Fraction of Unmethylated Alleles in the Patient ($f_U$)\nThe patient has full mutation mosaicism, meaning his body contains a mixture of cells with methylated and unmethylated *FMR1* promoters. Let $f_U$ be the fraction of alleles that are unmethylated and $f_M$ be the fraction that are methylated. As he is male, he has one X chromosome, so we consider a single population of alleles from his cells, where $f_U + f_M = 1$.\n\nThe HpaII enzyme digests only the unmethylated fraction, $f_U$, with the efficiency $E$ determined above. Therefore, the intensity of the digested fragments in the patient's lane, $I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}}$, is the product of the unmethylated fraction and the digestion efficiency.\n$$I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = f_U \\times E$$\nThe undigested band in the patient's lane, with intensity $I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{undig}}$, consists of two components: the fraction of alleles that are methylated and thus inherently resistant to digestion ($f_M$), and the fraction of unmethylated alleles that escaped digestion ($f_U \\times (1-E)$).\n$$I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{undig}} = f_M + f_U (1 - E) = (1 - f_U) + f_U(1-E) = 1 - f_U E$$\nBoth formulations are consistent. We can solve for $f_U$ using the simpler relationship involving the digested fragments:\n$$f_U = \\frac{I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}}}{E}$$\nSubstituting the given patient data, $I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = 0.2784$, and the calculated efficiency, $E = 0.928$:\n$$f_U = \\frac{0.2784}{0.928} = 0.3$$\nThis means $30\\%$ of the patient's *FMR1* alleles are unmethylated.\n\nStep 3: Prediction of Residual FMR1 Expression\nGene expression from the *FMR1* locus is assumed to be completely silenced when the promoter is methylated. Expression occurs only from the unmethylated alleles.\nA normal male's *FMR1* expression level is used as the reference (relative expression of $1$). Let the mRNA produced by a single normal, unmethylated allele be denoted by a baseline amount $X_{mRNA}$. The normal male's total expression is $E_{\\mathrm{normal}} = 1 \\times X_{mRNA} = X_{mRNA}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that an unmethylated full-mutation allele produces mRNA at a reduced fractional rate of $\\rho = 0.62$ compared to a normal allele. Thus, the expression from a single unmethylated full-mutation allele is $\\rho \\times X_{mRNA}$.\nThe patient's total expression, $E_{\\mathrm{patient}}$, is the sum of expression from his unmethylated and methylated alleles. Since methylated alleles are silent, this is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{patient}} = (f_U \\times \\rho \\times X_{mRNA}) + (f_M \\times 0) = f_U \\rho X_{mRNA}$$\nThe residual expression as a fraction of normal is the ratio $\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{patient}}}{E_{\\mathrm{normal}}}$.\n$$\\text{Residual Expression} = \\frac{f_U \\rho X_{mRNA}}{X_{mRNA}} = f_U \\rho$$\nSubstituting the calculated value $f_U = 0.3$ and the given value $\\rho = 0.62$:\n$$\\text{Residual Expression} = 0.3 \\times 0.62 = 0.186$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to four significant figures. Therefore, the predicted residual FMR1 expression is $0.1860$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1860}\n$$", "id": "2811296"}, {"introduction": "In modern genetic diagnostics, a single test rarely tells the whole story; instead, a diagnosis often emerges from synthesizing data from multiple assays.

The techniques described—PCR, TP-PCR, MS-MLPA, and SNP array—are standard laboratory procedures. The underlying biological concepts, such as CGG repeat expansion, DNA methylation, allele drop-out, and mosaicism, are central to the field. The problem is scientifically realistic and sound.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem presents a complex set of results that appear contradictory at first glance. Specifically, a normal PCR result ($30$ repeats) is paired with a finding of profound hypermethylation ($0.85-0.95$), which is typically associated with a full mutation ($>200$ repeats). However, thisapparent paradox does not render the problem ill-posed. Instead, it constitutes the central diagnostic challenge. The provided data are sufficient to allow for a single, most-plausible interpretation based on known limitations and behaviors of the assays. The question asks for this interpretation and the logical next step, which is a well-defined task.\n\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language, providing numerical data from laboratory tests. There is no subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n4.  **Consistency:** The data are internally consistent, although they point to a complex state. The SNP array and MLPA copy number results corroborate each other, confirming a single *FMR1* copy in a male. The MS-MLPA digestion controls validate the methylation enzyme activity. The combination of PCR, TP-PCR, and MS-MLPA results creates a specific diagnostic puzzle that has a known biological explanation. Therefore, the setup is not contradictory but rather a challenging, realistic case.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It describes a coherent, albeit complex, clinical genetics scenario that can be resolved through logical application of first principles in molecular diagnostics. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\nThe task is to reconcile the following observations for a male patient with neurodevelopmental delay:\n1.  **Normal Repeat Size by PCR:** Fluorescent PCR shows a single allele of ~$30$ CGG repeats. For a male ($46,XY$), who is hemizygous for the X-linked *FMR1* gene, detecting a single allele is expected. A repeat count of $30$ is within the normal range (typically defined as $5-44$). TP-PCR, a method designed to detect expansions, also failed to show evidence of an expanded allele. These results, in isolation, would suggest the patient is unaffected by Fragile X syndrome.\n2.  **Pathogenic Hypermethylation by MS-MLPA:** The MS-MLPA results show methylation indices of $0.85-0.95$. In a male, the *FMR1* promoter is normally unmethylated (methylation index $<0.10$). The observed high level of methylation indicates that the *FMR1* promoter is silenced in $85-95\\%$ of the cells from the DNA sample. This promoter hypermethylation is the canonical epigenetic mark of a full mutation expansion ($>200$ CGG repeats) and is the direct cause of transcriptional silencing and Fragile X syndrome.\n3.  **Normal Gene Copy Number:** Both MLPA and SNP array analyses confirm a single copy of the *FMR1* gene, ruling out large deletions or duplications as the cause of the phenotype or the anomalous test results. The $46,XY$ karyotype is also confirmed.\n\nThe central conflict is the presence of a normal-sized allele by PCR alongside methylation evidence for a full mutation. This can be resolved by considering a key technical limitation of PCR: **allele drop-out**. Very large, guanine-cytosine (GC)-rich DNA sequences, such as an *FMR1* full mutation, are notoriously difficult to amplify using standard PCR techniques. The polymerase enzyme often fails to traverse the long, stable hairpin-forming repeat region.\n\nThe most parsimonious explanation integrating all data points is **somatic mosaicism**. The patient possesses two distinct cell populations:\n-   A population of cells with a normal *FMR1* allele (~$30$ repeats, unmethylated).\n-   A population of cells with an *FMR1* full mutation ($>200$ repeats, hypermethylated).\n\nUnder this model:\n-   The PCR and TP-PCR assays preferentially amplify the smaller, normal allele from the first cell population. The large, expanded allele from the second population fails to amplify (allele drop-out), making it invisible to these methods. Therefore, only the normal allele is detected.\n-   The MS-MLPA assay is not based on amplification *across* the repeat but on methylation-dependent digestion of DNA at the promoter, followed by probe ligation and quantification. It therefore correctly reports the aggregate methylation status of all alleles in the sample. A methylation index of $0.85-0.95$ indicates that the cell line with the methylated full mutation constitutes $85-95\\%$ of the cells in the tested sample (e.g., peripheral blood), while the cell line with the normal unmethylated allele constitutes the remaining $5-15\\%$.\n-   This interpretation—a high-level mosaicism for a full mutation—is consistent with the clinical phenotype of neurodevelopmental delay and all laboratory findings.\n\nTo confirm this diagnosis, a method is required that can visualize the large, non-amplifiable allele. The gold standard for this is **Southern blot analysis**, which uses restriction digests and probe hybridization to determine fragment size, thereby revealing the full mutation and also confirming its methylation status. Alternatively, modern **single-molecule long-read sequencing** technologies can sequence through the entire repeat, directly confirming the presence and size of the large expansion.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Mosaic full mutation with a methylated expansion that fails to amplify by PCR in a subset of cells, with the observable normal-sized allele arising from the non-expanded cell fraction; confirm by Southern blot of FMR1 or single-molecule long-read sequencing to resolve large, methylated alleles.**\n-   This explanation correctly identifies mosaicism as the underlying state, invokes the principle of allele drop-out for the large expansion in PCR-based assays, and accounts for both the normal allele detection and the profound hypermethylation. The proposed confirmatory tests—Southern blot or long-read sequencing—are precisely the correct next steps to bypass the limitations of PCR and directly visualize the suspected full mutation.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Intragenic deletion removing the CGG repeat and flanking primer sites, producing an apparently normal-sized PCR amplicon despite loss of the repeat; confirm by targeted copy-number analysis using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).**\n-   This is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, a deletion of the primer sites would result in PCR failure, not the generation of a ~$30$ repeat amplicon. An amplicon was successfully generated. Second, a deletion does not cause the observed hypermethylation. Third, the problem states that MLPA copy number analysis was already performed and showed a single, intact copy, explicitly ruling out a deletion.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Duplication of the FMR1 locus elevates the methylation index by increasing the number of methylated copies; confirm by MLPA or microarray.**\n-   This is factually contradicted by the provided data. Both the MLPA copy number analysis and the SNP array definitively showed a single copy of the *FMR1* gene (relative dosage $\\approx 1.0$). A duplication in a male would have resulted in a relative dosage of $\\approx 2.0$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Technical artifact due to sequence variation abolishing the HhaI recognition site(s) used in MS-MLPA, causing apparent hypermethylation; confirm by Sanger sequencing of the HhaI sites only.**\n-   The MS-MLPA assay uses multiple probes targeting distinct HhaI restriction sites (sequence GCGC) within the *FMR1* promoter. The problem states that high methylation indices were observed \"across multiple probes.\" The probability of a patient having rare, independent SNPs that simultaneously abolish all or most of these sites is vanishingly small. While a single probe could be affected by a SNP, a consistent result across multiple probes makes this explanation highly implausible. Furthermore, the digestion controls were reported as adequate, indicating the enzyme itself was active.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Sample mix-up with a female showing skewed X-chromosome inactivation, yielding high methylation despite normal repeat size; confirm by an independent sex-typing assay.**\n-   This is decisively ruled out by the data. The SNP array analysis \"confirmed a male karyotype ($46,XY$)\". This is a definitive genetic sex determination. Therefore, the sample cannot be from a female. Suggesting an independent sex-typing assay is redundant and ignores the high-quality data already provided.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2811289"}]}
