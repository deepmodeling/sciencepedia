Solving this reveals the elegant efficiency embedded within the molecular logic of life.", "problem": "A messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is translated by transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs), each bearing a specific anticodon that base-pairs antiparallel to a codon. Assume the canonical nuclear genetic code with $61$ sense codons and $3$ stop codons, excluding recoding of selenocysteine and pyrrolysine. Base-pairing during translation follows these widely accepted, well-tested rules derived from the central dogma and Francis Crick’s wobble hypothesis:\n- Strict Watson–Crick pairing in the first two codon positions (codon positions $1$ and $2$; anticodon positions $36$ and $35$).\n- At the wobble position (codon position $3$; anticodon position $34$), allowed pairs are:\n  - Anticodon $C$ pairs with codon $G$ only.\n  - Anticodon $A$ pairs with codon $U$ only.\n  - Anticodon $U$ pairs with codon $A$ or $G$.\n  - Anticodon $G$ pairs with codon $C$ or $U$.\n  - Anticodon inosine ($I$) pairs with codon $U$, $C$, or $A$.\n- No tRNA may recognize a stop codon; release factors terminate at $UAA$, $UAG$, and $UGA$.\n\nUse the standard organization of the genetic code into $16$ “codon boxes,” each defined by the first two codon bases $XY$ and containing the four codons $XYU$, $XYC$, $XYA$, $XYG$. In the canonical code:\n- The $8$ fourfold-degenerate boxes (all four codons encode the same amino acid) are $UC$, $CU$, $CC$, $CG$, $AC$, $GU$, $GC$, $GG$.\n- Split boxes with two different sense amino acids are $UU$ (Phe $U/C$, Leu $A/G$), $CA$ (His $U/C$, Gln $A/G$), $AA$ (Asn $U/C$, Lys $A/G$), $GA$ (Asp $U/C$, Glu $A/G$), and $AG$ (Ser $U/C$, Arg $A/G$).\n- Boxes with stop codons: $UA$ (Tyr $U/C$, stops $A/G$), $UG$ (Cys $U/C$, stop $A$, Trp $G$), $AU$ (Ile $U/C/A$, Met $G$).\n\nUnder these assumptions, determine the minimal number of distinct tRNA anticodons required to unambiguously decode all $61$ sense codons (no ambiguity and no stop-codon recognition), allowing inosine at anticodon position $34$ where advantageous. Express your final answer as a single integer. No rounding is needed.", "solution": "We begin from the central dogma’s translation step: a transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) anticodon binds an mRNA codon by antiparallel base-pairing. Fidelity is high at codon positions $1$ and $2$, while position $3$ admits “wobble” pairing. Therefore, for a fixed first-two-base context $XY$ (a “codon box”), a single tRNA anticodon can potentially recognize multiple codons within that box if its wobble base at anticodon position $34$ can legally pair with the corresponding set of third codon bases.\n\nKey wobble facts we will use:\n- Anticodon $C$ recognizes only codon-third-base $G$.\n- Anticodon $A$ recognizes only codon-third-base $U$.\n- Anticodon $U$ recognizes codon-third-bases $A$ and $G$.\n- Anticodon $G$ recognizes codon-third-bases $C$ and $U$.\n- Anticodon $I$ recognizes codon-third-bases $U$, $C$, and $A$.\n\nWe also require that no tRNA recognize any stop codon; thus, any anticodon choice whose wobble pairing would erroneously read a stop codon is disallowed.\n\nStrategy. We count the minimal anticodons box-by-box, because distinct first-two-base contexts $XY$ require distinct anticodon positions $35$ and $36$, so anticodons are not reusable across boxes. For each box we find the minimal number of anticodons covering exactly the sense codons present.\n\nStep $1$: Fourfold-degenerate boxes. There are $8$ such boxes: $UC$, $CU$, $CC$, $CG$, $AC$, $GU$, $GC$, $GG$. Each contains $4$ sense codons ($XYU$, $XYC$, $XYA$, $XYG$) for the same amino acid. What is the minimum number of anticodons needed?\n\n- Any single wobble base recognizes at most $3$ distinct third bases: anticodon $I$ recognizes $\\{U,C,A\\}$ but misses $G$; anticodon $U$ recognizes $\\{A,G\\}$ (size $2$); anticodon $G$ recognizes $\\{U,C\\}$ (size $2$). Therefore, one anticodon cannot cover all $4$ codons.\n- Two anticodons suffice: choose wobble $G$ to cover $\\{U,C\\}$ and wobble $U$ to cover $\\{A,G\\}$. Together they cover $\\{U,C,A,G\\}$.\n- Minimality: impossible with $1$ anticodon, as shown; hence the minimum is $2$ per fourfold box.\n\nContribution from $8$ boxes: $8 \\times 2 = 16$ anticodons.\n\nStep $2$: Split boxes with two sense families partitioned by pyrimidine/purine at the third position. These are $UU$, $CA$, $AA$, $GA$, and $AG$. Each such box has one amino acid encoded by $XYU/XYC$ and another encoded by $XYA/XYG$.\n\n- For the $U/C$ pair, one anticodon with wobble $G$ recognizes both $U$ and $C$.\n- For the $A/G$ pair, one anticodon with wobble $U$ recognizes both $A$ and $G$.\n- No extra constraints (no stops in these halves), so each such box requires exactly $2$ anticodons.\n\nContribution from $5$ boxes: $5 \\times 2 = 10$ anticodons.\n\nStep $3$: Boxes with stops.\n(a) $UA$ box: Tyr is encoded by $UAU/UAC$; $UAA/UAG$ are stops. A single anticodon with wobble $G$ recognizes $\\{U,C\\}$ and decodes both Tyr codons. An anticodon with wobble $U$ would inappropriately recognize $\\{A,G\\}$, i.e., the stops, so it is disallowed. Therefore the minimal number is $1$.\n\nContribution: $1$.\n\n(b) $UG$ box: Cys is encoded by $UGU/UGC$, $UGA$ is a stop, $UGG$ is Trp. For Cys, one anticodon with wobble $G$ recognizes $\\{U,C\\}$. For Trp ($UGG$ only), we must choose an anticodon wobble that recognizes $G$ but not $A$, to avoid $UGA$ stop. Anticodon $U$ recognizes $\\{A,G\\}$ and would misread the stop $UGA$, so it is disallowed. Anticodon $C$ recognizes only $G$ and thus specifically reads $UGG$ without recognizing $UGA$. Hence we need $2$ anticodons total in this box.\n\nContribution: $2$.\n\n(c) $AU$ box: Ile is encoded by $AUU/AUC/AUA$, Met is encoded by $AUG$. For Ile, a single anticodon with wobble $I$ recognizes $\\{U,C,A\\}$ and crucially does not recognize $G$, so it decodes all three Ile codons but not Met. For Met ($AUG$ only), we can use anticodon wobble $C$ to recognize only $G$ (and thus not AUA). Therefore this box needs $2$ anticodons.\n\nContribution: $2$.\n\nStep $4$: Sum over all boxes. Let $N$ be the minimal number of distinct anticodons:\n- Fourfold boxes: $16$.\n- Split sense/sense boxes: $10$.\n- $UA$ (Tyr-only sense half): $1$.\n- $UG$ (Cys plus Trp, with a stop): $2$.\n- $AU$ (Ile plus Met): $2$.\n\nThus\n$$\nN \\;=\\; 16 \\;+\\; 10 \\;+\\; 1 \\;+\\; 2 \\;+\\; 2 \\;=\\; 31.\n$$\n\nMinimality is guaranteed by:\n- The impossibility of $1$ anticodon covering a fourfold-degenerate box under the stated wobble rules (maximum coverage size is $3$, and that misses $G$ when using $I$).\n- The necessity of one anticodon per half in split boxes to avoid cross-amino-acid decoding and to satisfy the required third-base sets $\\{U,C\\}$ and $\\{A,G\\}$.\n- The necessity in $UG$ and $AU$ boxes to avoid recognizing stops or the wrong amino acid, which fixes the wobble choice and precludes any further consolidation.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of distinct tRNA anticodons required, under the stated assumptions and wobble rules with inosine allowed, is $31$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31}$$", "id": "2856000"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the rules of decoding, the central dogma operates as a dynamic system governed by rates of synthesis and decay.

Translation initiates at the first AUG in exon $1$ and terminates at the canonical stop codon at the end of exon $3$. The mature mRNA contains exon junction complexes (EJCs) deposited upstream of exon–exon junctions; in mammalian cells, a premature termination codon more than $50$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction typically triggers Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD). Assume no alternative splicing or RNA editing.\n\nThe wild-type open reading frame spans three exons with lengths: exon $1$ has $150$ nucleotides, exon $2$ has $300$ nucleotides, and exon $3$ has $450$ nucleotides, for a total coding region of $900$ nucleotides encoding $300$ amino acids before the canonical stop. Number positions in coding DNA (cDNA) from the first coding nucleotide as position $1$.\n\nConsider the following engineered alleles; all changes lie within exons and do not affect splice sites. An insertion or deletion (indel) shifts the reading frame by $+k$ or $-k$ nucleotides, respectively, until any subsequent indel occurs. Translation halts at the first stop codon encountered in the current frame.\n\n- Construct C$1$: a single-nucleotide insertion at position $201$ (within exon $2$). In the $+1$ frame created by this insertion, the first stop codon occurs $45$ codons downstream of the insertion site.\n- Construct C$2$: the same single-nucleotide insertion at position $201$ plus a $4$-nucleotide deletion at position $231$ (both within exon $2$). In the $+1$ frame created by the insertion, the first stop codon is $45$ codons downstream of position $201$ (as in C$1$).\n- Construct C$3$: the same single-nucleotide insertion at position $201$ plus a $2$-nucleotide deletion at position $501$ (the deletion is within exon $3$). In the $+1$ frame created by the insertion, the first stop codon is $45$ codons downstream of position $201$ (as in C$1$).\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct? Select all that apply.\n\nA. In C$1$, translation terminates within exon $2$ in the shifted frame before the exon $2/3$ junction; because the premature stop is more than $50$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction, the mRNA is predicted to undergo Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD), and no downstream restoration of frame is possible.\n\nB. In C$2$, the net frameshift is $(+1-4)\\bmod 3\\equiv 0$, and the $4$-nucleotide deletion occurs before the first stop codon in the shifted frame; therefore, the original reading frame is restored prior to encountering any stop codon, translation proceeds to the canonical stop in exon $3$, and the resulting protein is near full-length with an internal segment of altered amino acid sequence between the indels. The mRNA is unlikely to be subject to NMD.\n\nC. In C$3$, although the net frameshift is $(+1-2)\\bmod 3\\equiv -1\\bmod 3\\neq 0$, the ribosome can read through the premature stop codon encountered in exon $2$ to reach the compensatory deletion in exon $3$, so a full-length protein is produced and NMD is avoided.\n\nD. Any pair of indels whose total length is divisible by $3$ will restore the exact wild-type amino acid sequence between the two lesions, independent of their order or the positions of stop codons encountered in the interim.\n\nE. In a multi-exon eukaryotic mRNA, whether compensatory indels can rescue protein production depends not only on whether their net length is a multiple of $3$, but also on whether a premature termination codon is encountered before the compensating event and on the position of that premature termination codon relative to the final exon–exon junction (the $50$-nucleotide rule for NMD).", "solution": "First, we establish the gene's coordinate system.
