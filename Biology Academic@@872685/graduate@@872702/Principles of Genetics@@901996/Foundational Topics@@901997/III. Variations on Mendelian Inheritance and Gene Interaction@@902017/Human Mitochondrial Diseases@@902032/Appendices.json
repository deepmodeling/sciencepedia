The number of COX-negative fibers in each group, $Y_i$, is a random variable following a binomial distribution, $Y_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_i, p(h_i))$. The likelihood function $L(\\beta_0, \\beta_1)$ is the product of the probabilities of observing the data for each independent group:\n$$\nL(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} \\binom{n_i}{y_i} p(h_i)^{y_i} [1-p(h_i)]^{n_i-y_i}\n$$\nFor maximization, we use the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\ln(L(\\beta_0, \\beta_1))$. Ignoring the constant binomial coefficient terms, the function to be maximized is:\n$$\n\\ell^{\\ast}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left\\{ y_i \\ln[p(h_i)] + (n_i - y_i) \\ln[1-p(h_i)] \\right\\}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\ln[p(h_i)]$ and $\\ln[1-p(h_i)]$ from the logistic model yields:\n$$\n\\ell^{\\ast}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left[ y_i (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 h_i) - n_i \\ln(1 + \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 h_i)) \\right]\n$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, we set the partial derivatives of $\\ell^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ to zero. This yields a system of two non-linear equations, which typically requires numerical methods.\n\nHowever, we should first inspect the data. The empirical proportions of COX-negative fibers are:\n- At $h_1 = 0.50$: $\\hat{p}_1 = y_1/n_1 = 2/10 = 0.2$\n- At $h_2 = 0.75$: $\\hat{p}_2 = y_2/n_2 = 5/10 = 0.5$\n- At $h_3 = 1.00$: $\\hat{p}_3 = y_3/n_3 = 8/10 = 0.8$\n\nLet us compute the empirical logits (log-odds) for these proportions:\n- $\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{1-0.2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.8}\\right) = \\ln(0.25) = -\\ln(4)$\n- $\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_2) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}\\right) = \\ln(1) = 0$\n- $\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_3) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8}{1-0.8}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8}{0.2}\\right) = \\ln(4)$\n\nWe observe that the points $(h_i, \\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_i))$ are $(0.50, -\\ln(4))$, $(0.75, 0)$, and $(1.00, \\ln(4))$. We test if these points are collinear.\nThe slope between points $1$ and $2$ is:\n$$ m_{12} = \\frac{0 - (-\\ln(4))}{0.75 - 0.50} = \\frac{\\ln(4)}{0.25} = 4\\ln(4) = 8\\ln(2) $$\nThe slope between points $2$ and $3$ is:\n$$ m_{23} = \\frac{\\ln(4) - 0}{1.00 - 0.75} = \\frac{\\ln(4)}{0.25} = 4\\ln(4) = 8\\ln(2) $$\nSince the slopes are identical, the empirical logits fall perfectly on a line. In this specific case, the maximum likelihood estimates for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are the parameters of this line.\nThe slope is the MLE for $\\beta_1$:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 8\\ln(2) $$\nUsing the point $(h_2, \\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_2)) = (0.75, 0)$, we find the intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_0$:\n$$ 0 = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1(0.75) \\implies \\hat{\\beta}_0 = -(8\\ln(2))(0.75) = -6\\ln(2) $$\nThus, the fitted logistic model is:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(h)}{1-p(h)}\\right) = -6\\ln(2) + (8\\ln(2))h $$\nThe problem requires finding the heteroplasmy threshold $h^{\\ast}$ where $p(h^{\\ast}) = 0.5$.\nSetting $p(h^{\\ast}) = 0.5$ is equivalent to setting the logit to zero:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}\\right) = \\ln(1) = 0 $$\nTherefore, we must solve for $h^{\\ast}$ in the equation:\n$$ -6\\ln(2) + (8\\ln(2))h^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n$$ (8\\ln(2))h^{\\ast} = 6\\ln(2) $$\nSince $\\ln(2) \\neq 0$, we can divide by it:\n$$ 8h^{\\ast} = 6 $$\n$$ h^{\\ast} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nAs a decimal fraction, the heteroplasmy threshold is $0.75$. This value is an exact rational number, so no rounding is necessary.

This uncertainty is largely due to the \"mitochondrial bottleneck,\" a stochastic event during the formation of egg cells that can lead to dramatic and unpredictable shifts in heteroplasmy from one generation to the next. This practice requires you to construct a mathematical model of this genetic bottleneck using the principles of binomial sampling. By deriving a formal expression for recurrence risk, you will gain a deep, quantitative appreciation for why children of the same mother can inherit a wide spectrum of mutant mtDNA loads, leading to vastly different clinical severities [@problem_id:2823736].", "problem": "A woman carries the pathogenic mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) variant m.8993T>G in the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit 6 gene (MT-ATP6). Her blood heteroplasmy is measured at $0.20$. Clinical observation for this variant supports a threshold effect: offspring are expected to manifest clinically significant disease if their tissue heteroplasmy fraction $H$ is at least $t = 0.60$. Assume the following foundational principles and modeling assumptions:\n\n- Maternal inheritance of mtDNA with negligible paternal contribution.\n- A developmental mitochondrial bottleneck can be approximated by binomial sampling of an effective number $N_e$ of segregating mtDNA genomes into each oocyte, with per-genome mutant probability equal to the maternal mean heteroplasmy $p_0 = 0.20$.\n- Post-bottleneck amplification and subsequent embryonic development occur without selection on the variant and without additional systematic shifts in $H$, so that the oocyte fraction $H$ approximates the conceptus fraction at clinical ascertainment.\n- The maternal blood heteroplasmy approximates the maternal mean heteroplasmy across the oocyte precursor pool.\n\nStarting strictly from these principles and assumptions (no additional shortcut formulas), derive a closed-form analytic expression for the recurrence risk $R(N_e)$ that a randomly selected offspring will have $H \\ge t$, expressed solely as a function of $N_e$, $p_0 = 0.20$, and $t = 0.60$.

Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression for $R(N_e)$; do not include any units, and do not provide a numerical approximation.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mitochondrial genetics, is well-posed with a clear objective and a specified probabilistic model, and is free from ambiguity or contradiction. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the recurrence risk, $R(N_e)$, for an offspring of a mother with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy $p_0 = 0.20$. The clinical manifestation of the disease occurs if the offspring's heteroplasmy fraction, $H$, meets or exceeds a threshold $t = 0.60$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the mitochondrial bottleneck, which is modeled as a binomial sampling process. Let $N_e$ be the effective number of mtDNA genomes segregating into an oocyte. Each of these genomes is a mutant with probability $p_0$, independently of the others. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of mutant mtDNA genomes that are segregated into a particular oocyte.\n\nAccording to the binomial sampling model provided, $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N_e$ (the number of trials) and $p_0$ (the probability of success, i.e., sampling a mutant genome). We write this as $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N_e, p_0)$. The probability mass function (PMF) for $K$ is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{N_e}{k} p_0^k (1-p_0)^{N_e-k}$$\nfor $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, N_e\\}$.\n\nThe heteroplasmy fraction $H$ in the oocyte is defined as the ratio of mutant genomes to the total number of genomes. Based on our definition of $K$ and $N_e$, we have:\n$$H = \\frac{K}{N_e}$$\n\nThe recurrence risk, $R(N_e)$, is the probability that an offspring will be clinically affected, which corresponds to the condition $H \\ge t$. We can express this in terms of the random variable $K$:\n$$R(N_e) = P(H \\ge t) = P\\left(\\frac{K}{N_e} \\ge t\\right) = P(K \\ge t N_e)$$\n\nSince $K$ must be an integer, the condition $K \\ge t N_e$ is equivalent to $K$ being greater than or equal to the smallest integer that satisfies this inequality. This smallest integer is $\\lceil t N_e \\rceil$. Let us define $k_{\\min} = \\lceil t N_e \\rceil$. The risk $R(N_e)$ is the probability that $K$ takes on any integer value from $k_{\\min}$ up to the maximum possible value, $N_e$. This is calculated by summing the probabilities for each of these outcomes:\n$$R(N_e) = \\sum_{k=k_{\\min}}^{N_e} P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=\\lceil t N_e \\rceil}^{N_e} \\binom{N_e}{k} p_0^k (1-p_0)^{N_e-k}$$\n\nThis sum represents the cumulative probability in the right tail of a binomial distribution. While this expression is correct, a more compact closed-form representation is available using a standard special function. The sum of the tail probabilities of a binomial distribution can be expressed using the regularized incomplete beta function, denoted as $I_x(a,b)$. The identity is:\n$$ \\sum_{j=m}^{n} \\binom{n}{j} p^j (1-p)^{n-j} = I_p(m, n-m+1) $$\nApplying this identity to our expression for $R(N_e)$, we set $n=N_e$, $p=p_0$, and the starting index $m = \\lceil t N_e \\rceil$. This yields the closed-form analytic expression for the recurrence risk:\n$$R(N_e) = I_{p_0}(\\lceil t N_e \\rceil, N_e - \\lceil t N_e \\rceil + 1)$$\nwhere $p_0 = 0.20$ and $t = 0.60$. This is the final expression for the recurrence risk as a function of $N_e$, $p_0$, and $t$.\n\nFrom this functional dependence, two key counseling implications can be logically derived:\n\n1.  Dependence on $N_e$: The variance of the offspring heteroplasmy distribution is given by $\\text{Var}(H) = \\text{Var}(K/N_e) = (1/N_e^2)\\text{Var}(K) = (p_0(1-p_0))/N_e$. As the effective bottleneck size $N_e$ increases, the variance of $H$ decreases. This means the distribution of offspring heteroplasmy becomes more tightly centered around the maternal mean, $p_0 = 0.20$. Since the maternal heteroplasmy is substantially lower than the clinical threshold ($0.20 \\ll 0.60$), a tighter distribution (larger $N_e$) makes it less probable that a random sampling event will produce an oocyte with heteroplasmy high enough to cross the threshold. Consequently, a larger bottleneck size $N_e$ lowers the recurrence risk for this mother.\n\n2.  Dependence on $t$: The recurrence risk is the probability of exceeding the threshold, $R(N_e) = P(H \\ge t)$. For any given distribution of $H$ (determined by $N_e$ and $p_0$), increasing the value of the threshold $t$ makes the condition for being affected more stringent. This necessarily reduces the probability of satisfying the condition. Therefore, for a given maternal state, a mitochondrial disease with a higher clinical threshold $t$ inherently carries a lower recurrence risk of manifesting in offspring.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\nI_{p_0}(\\lceil t N_e \\rceil, N_e - \\lceil t N_e \\rceil + 1)\n}\n$$", "id": "2823736"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal in studying mitochondrial diseases is to develop effective treatments, and a leading strategy involves reducing the pathogenic mutant mtDNA load within a patient's cells.

A rigorous, step-by-step derivation will be executed.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the initial state of the system through the two specified processes: selective degradation and compensatory replication.\n\nFirst, we define the initial state of the system in terms of the given parameters.\nThe initial number of mutant mtDNA copies is $M_{0}$. The initial number of wild-type mtDNA copies is $W_{0}$. The total number of mtDNA copies is $N$.\nThe initial heteroplasmy is given by $h_{0} = \\frac{M_{0}}{N}$.\nFrom this definition, we can express the initial counts of mutant and wild-type genomes as functions of $N$ and $h_{0}$:\n$M_{0} = N h_{0}$\n$W_{0} = N - M_{0} = N - N h_{0} = N(1 - h_{0})$\n\nNext, we model the effect of the endonuclease treatment. This process involves the selective cleavage and subsequent degradation of mutant mtDNA.\nA fraction $e$ of the mutant genomes are degraded. The number of degraded mutant molecules is therefore $e M_{0}$.\nThe number of mutant genomes remaining after this degradation event, denoted $M_{1}$, is:\n$$M_{1} = M_{0} - e M_{0} = M_{0}(1 - e)$$\nThe wild-type genomes are unaffected by the endonuclease, so their count remains unchanged:\n$$W_{1} = W_{0}$$\nThe total mtDNA copy number in the cell is reduced. The new total, $N_{1}$, is:\n$$N_{1} = M_{1} + W_{1} = M_{0}(1 - e) + W_{0}$$\nSubstituting $M_{0} + W_{0} = N$, we find:\n$$N_{1} = M_{0} - e M_{0} + W_{0} = (M_{0} + W_{0}) - e M_{0} = N - e M_{0}$$\nThe deficit in mtDNA copy number is $N - N_{1} = e M_{0}$.\n\nThe third step is the homeostatic response: compensatory replication to restore the total copy number to $N$.\nThe problem states that only intact wild-type genomes replicate to fill this deficit. This is a critical principle. The number of new mtDNA molecules that must be synthesized is exactly the number that was degraded: $e M_{0}$.\nSince only wild-type genomes serve as templates, all newly synthesized molecules will be of the wild-type.\nThe final number of mutant genomes, $M_{\\text{post}}$, will be the same as the number after degradation, as mutants do not participate in replication.\n$$M_{\\text{post}} = M_{1} = M_{0}(1 - e)$$\nThe final number of wild-type genomes, $W_{\\text{post}}$, is the sum of the initial wild-type count and the newly synthesized wild-type molecules:\n$$W_{\\text{post}} = W_{1} + e M_{0} = W_{0} + e M_{0}$$\nWe must verify that the total copy number is restored to $N$:\n$$M_{\\text{post}} + W_{\\text{post}} = M_{0}(1 - e) + (W_{0} + e M_{0}) = M_{0} - e M_{0} + W_{0} + e M_{0} = M_{0} + W_{0} = N$$\nThe total copy number is indeed restored to $N$, consistent with the premise of homeostasis.\n\nFinally, we calculate the final heteroplasmy, $h_{\\text{post}}$, and the change in heteroplasmy, $\\Delta h$.\nThe final heteroplasmy is the ratio of the final mutant count to the final total count:\n$$h_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{post}}}{N} = \\frac{M_{0}(1 - e)}{N}$$\nWe can express this in terms of the initial heteroplasmy $h_{0}$ by substituting $M_{0} = N h_{0}$:\n$$h_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{(N h_{0})(1 - e)}{N} = h_{0}(1 - e)$$\nThe problem asks for the change in heteroplasmy, $\\Delta h = h_{\\text{post}} - h_{0}$:\n$$\\Delta h = h_{0}(1 - e) - h_{0}$$\nDistributing the term $h_{0}$:\n$$\\Delta h = h_{0} - h_{0} e - h_{0}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression:\n$$\\Delta h = -h_{0} e$$\nThis result is a closed-form analytic expression for the change in heteroplasmy as a function of the initial heteroplasmy $h_{0}$ and the cleavage efficiency $e$, as required.
