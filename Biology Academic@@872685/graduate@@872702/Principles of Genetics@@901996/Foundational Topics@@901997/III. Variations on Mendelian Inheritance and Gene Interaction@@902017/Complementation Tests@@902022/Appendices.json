Seven independent, recessive, haploid mutant strains that are auxotrophic (unable to produce a required nutrient) have been isolated. These strains, labeled `mut1` through `mut7`, are unable to grow on a minimal medium (MM) but can grow if the medium is supplemented with the pathway's final product.\n\nTo determine how many different genes are represented by this collection of mutations, complementation tests are performed. Diploid cells are created by mating pairs of the haploid mutant strains. The resulting diploid's phenotype is then scored by its ability to grow on MM. Growth on MM indicates that complementation has occurred, while no growth indicates a failure to complement.\n\nAs expected, when any mutant strain is crossed with the wild-type strain, the resulting diploid grows on MM. Also, when any mutant strain is crossed with itself, the resulting diploid fails to grow on MM. The crucial results come from crosses between different mutant strains.

Consider representing a collection of mutants as a graph: construct an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ where each vertex in $V$ corresponds to a mutant allele and an undirected edge in $E$ connects a pair of mutants if and only if the pair fails to complement (that is, exhibits a mutant phenotype in trans). Under ideal assumptions (recessive loss-of-function, no non-allelic non-complementation, no dominance, complete testing), mutants that belong to the same gene should form a connected subgraph with all pairwise edges present, and there should be no edges between genes.\n\nYou are given $n=12$ mutants $m_1,\\dots,m_{12}$ tested pairwise, with the following observed non-complementing pairs (and no others):\n- Within-gene-like sets:\n  - $(m_1,m_4)$, $(m_1,m_7)$, $(m_4,m_7)$, $(m_4,m_9)$, $(m_7,m_9)$\n  - $(m_2,m_5)$\n  - $(m_3,m_6)$, $(m_6,m_8)$\n  - $(m_{10},m_{12})$\n- Cross-gene-like pairs:\n  - $(m_7,m_3)$\n  - $(m_5,m_{10})$\nAll remaining pairs were tested and complemented (that is, no additional non-complementation edges exist beyond those listed).\n\nUsing only the first principles above and standard definitions from graph theory, answer the following.

The provided non-complementing pairs define the edge set $E$ as follows:\n$E = \\{(m_1,m_4), (m_1,m_7), (m_4,m_7), (m_4,m_9), (m_7,m_9)\\} \\cup \\{(m_2,m_5)\\} \\cup \\{(m_3,m_6), (m_6,m_8)\\} \\cup \\{(m_{10},m_{12})\\} \\cup \\{(m_7,m_3)\\} \\cup \\{(m_5,m_{10})\\}$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first determining the connected components of this graph $G$, and then evaluating each statement based on this structure and the provided principles of genetics and graph theory.\n\nA connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph. We identify the components of $G$:\n1.  Starting with vertex $m_1$, it is connected to $m_4$ and $m_7$. Vertex $m_4$ is connected to $m_1$, $m_7$, and $m_9$. Vertex $m_7$ is connected to $m_1$, $m_4$, $m_9$, and also to $m_3$. Vertex $m_3$ is connected to $m_7$ and $m_6$. Vertex $m_6$ is connected to $m_3$ and $m_8$. This chain of connections forms a single connected component containing the vertices $\\{m_1, m_3, m_4, m_6, m_7, m_8, m_9\\}$.\n2.  Starting with vertex $m_2$, it is connected to $m_5$. Vertex $m_5$ is connected to $m_2$ and also to $m_{10}$. Vertex $m_{10}$ is connected to $m_5$ and $m_{12}$. This forms a second connected component containing the vertices $\\{m_2, m_5, m_{10}, m_{12}\\}$.\n3.  Vertex $m_{11}$ is not listed in any non-complementing pair. Therefore, it has no incident edges and forms an isolated component by itself: $\\{m_{11}\\}$.\n\nThere are $3$ connected components in total.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The connected components of $G$ built from the listed non-complementing pairs are exactly $\\{m_1,m_3,m_4,m_6,m_7,m_8,m_9\\}$, $\\{m_2,m_5,m_{10},m_{12}\\}$, and $\\{m_{11}\\}$; if one accepted connected components as complementation groups, one would infer $3$ genes.**\nOur analysis above confirms the set of connected components is precisely $\\{m_1, m_3, m_4, m_6, m_7, m_8, m_9\\}$, $\\{m_2, m_5, m_{10}, m_{12}\\}$, and $\\{m_{11}\\}$. The number of connected components is $3$. Interpreting each connected component as a single complementation group (and thus a single gene) is a standard first approximation. This interpretation would lead to the conclusion that there are $3$ genes represented by the $12$ mutants. The statement is factually correct based on the provided data and standard definitions.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the idealized model with no non-allelic non-complementation and no intragenic complementation, counting connected components of $G$ yields the number of genes.**\nThe problem states that under the idealized model, mutants for a single gene form a clique (a subgraph where all pairs of vertices are connected by an edge), and there are no edges between vertices corresponding to different genes. By definition, a clique is a connected subgraph. Since there are no edges between these cliques, each clique forms a distinct connected component of the overall graph $G$. Therefore, in this idealized scenario, there is a one-to-one correspondence between genes and connected components. Counting the connected components is equivalent to counting the genes.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The cross edges $(m_7,m_3)$ and $(m_5,m_{10})$ are a signature of non-allelic non-complementation; one principled approach to recover the likely gene partition is to remove a minimal number of edges to maximize the likelihood under a model where each gene forms a dense subgraph (for example, by cluster editing or a stochastic block model), then take connected components.**\nThe within-gene-like sets suggest four potential gene groups: $\\{m_1, m_4, m_7, m_9\\}$, $\\{m_2, m_5\\}$, $\\{m_3, m_6, m_8\\}$, and $\\{m_{10}, m_{12}\\}$. The edges $(m_7,m_3)$ and $(m_5,m_{10})$ connect distinct groups. This phenomenon, where alleles of different genes fail to complement, is known as non-allelic or intergenic non-complementation. It often occurs when the gene products are part of the same protein complex. The statement correctly identifies these edges as a sign of this phenomenon. The ideal structure is a graph partitioned into disjoint cliques. The observed graph deviates from this. To recover the most likely underlying partition, one can seek to find the \"closest\" ideal graph by making a minimum number of edits (edge additions or removals). The problem of removing a minimal number of edges to partition a graph into disjoint cliques is a well-known problem in graph theory called cluster editing. More generally, finding dense subgraphs (communities) can be approached with probabilistic methods like the stochastic block model. The proposed strategy is a standard and principled method in computational biology for analyzing such noisy data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In the presence of allele-specific intragenic complementation, requiring each complementation group to be a clique is too strict; connected components are more appropriate because they allow some within-group pairs to complement as long as there exists a non-complementation path connecting all alleles of the gene.**\nIntragenic complementation occurs when two different mutant alleles within the same gene produce a wild-type phenotype when combined in a trans-heterozygote. In the graph representation, this corresponds to a *missing edge* between two vertices that belong to the same complementation group. Consequently, the set of vertices for that gene will not form a clique. For example, in the putative gene group $\\{m_1, m_4, m_7, m_9\\}$, the edge $(m_1, m_9)$ is missing, suggesting possible intragenic complementation. However, as long as the subgraph corresponding to the gene's alleles is connected (i.e., there is a path of non-complementing pairs between any two alleles), all alleles will be grouped into a single connected component. Therefore, using connected components as the criterion for defining a gene is more robust to the effects of intragenic complementation than the stricter requirement of a clique. The statement accurately describes this principle.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. If a mutant carries a dominant-negative allele, representing non-complementation as undirected edges and taking connected components remains robust because dominant-negative effects are symmetric and do not bias grouping.**\nA dominant-negative allele produces a protein product that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein product. In a complementation test, a dominant-negative allele $m_{DN}$ from gene A can cause a mutant phenotype even when paired with a recessive loss-of-function mutation $m_X$ in a completely different gene B. This results in non-complementation, creating an edge $(m_{DN}, m_X)$ between two different genes. If an allele is strongly dominant-negative, it may fail to complement mutations in many or all other genes under study. This would create numerous edges connecting otherwise distinct complementation groups, causing them to merge into one large, meaningless connected component. This is a severe form of non-allelic non-complementation that completely undermines the logic of the test. The method of taking connected components is therefore *not* robust to dominant-negative effects; it is heavily biased by them. The claim of robustness is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. With quantitative growth scores rather than binary calls, one can represent edges with weights and infer groupings using community detection or probabilistic models, which can be more robust than strict connected components when edges include false positives and false negatives.**\nReal biological data is often quantitative, not binary. Complementation can be partial, which can be captured by, for example, a colony growth score. This quantitative information can be used to define edge weights in the graph, where a stronger phenotype (less complementation) corresponds to a higher edge weight. The binary approach of drawing an edge if the score is below some arbitrary threshold is sensitive to noise and the choice of threshold, leading to false-positive edges (non-allelic non-complementation) and false-negative edges (intragenic complementation). Graph algorithms for community detection (e.g., modularity-based methods) and probabilistic frameworks (e.g., stochastic block models) are specifically designed to operate on weighted graphs and identify clusters of densely connected nodes even in the presence of such noise. These methods are indeed more robust and provide a more nuanced interpretation of the data than a simple connected components analysis on an unweighted graph.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCDF}$$", "id": "2801067"}, {"introduction": "One of the most common exceptions that can confound the interpretation of a complementation test is non-allelic non-complementation, often arising from dosage sensitivity in interacting pathways.

Pairwise trans-heterozygotes $m_i/m_j$ exhibit several cases of non-complementation. The investigator suspects two possible mechanisms: (i) true allelism, in which two mutations reside in the same gene and fail to restore function in trans, and (ii) dosage-sensitive non-allelic non-complementation, in which partial reduction of activity in two different genes that contribute to the same quantitative function drops below a functional threshold when combined.\n\nThey have engineered two alleles at gene $A$: a molecularly defined null allele $a^0$ (no detectable product) and a hypomorphic allele $a^{hyp}$ that produces a reduced but nonzero level of functional product, quantified as a fraction $\\alpha$ of the wild-type activity with $0<\\alpha<1$. Wild type is denoted $+$.\n\nAs a general principle, the complementation test assesses whether the trans-heterozygote $X/Y$ restores function, where function can be modeled as a quantitative activity $F$ that must meet or exceed a threshold $T$ for a wild-type phenotype.

Let the unknown mutation be $m$.\n\nLet us normalize the activity contributed by a single wild-type allele $(+)$ of any relevant gene to $1$.\n-   Activity of allele $+$: $f_+ = 1$.\n-   Activity of allele $a^0$: $f_{a^0} = 0$.\n-   Activity of allele $a^{hyp}$: $f_{a^{hyp}} = \\alpha$, with $0 < \\alpha < 1$.\n-   Activity of a recessive mutant allele $m$: $f_m$. Since $m$ is recessive, a heterozygote $+/m$ is wild type. Let us consider the minimal system of two essential genes, $A$ and $B$. A wild-type organism is $+_A/+_A ; +_B/+_B$, with total activity $F_{WT} = (1+1) + (1+1) = 4$.\nA heterozygote for $m$ (e.g., in gene $B$), $+_A/+_A ; +_B/m_B$, is wild-type. Its activity is $(1+1)+(1+f_m) = 3+f_m \\ge T$. A homozygote $m_B/m_B$ is mutant, so $+_A/+_A ; m_B/m_B$ has activity $(1+1)+(f_m+f_m) = 2+2f_m < T$.\nThis establishes bounds on the threshold: $2+2f_m < T \\le 3+f_m$. This is consistent as long as $f_m < 1$.\nThe observation of non-allelic non-complementation means a trans-heterozygote like $+_A/m_A ; +_B/m_B$ is mutant. Its activity is $(1+f_{m_A}) + (1+f_{m_B}) < T$. If we assume for simplicity that the recessive mutations are nulls ($f_m \\approx 0$), this simplifies to $2 < T \\le 3$. This is a consistent framework for dosage sensitivity.\n\nNow we analyze the two scenarios for the unknown mutation $m$.\n\n**Scenario 1: True Allelism**\nThe mutation $m$ is an allele of Gene $A$. Let's call it $m_A$. All other genes are wild-type $(+/+)$. We test $m_A$ against $a^0$ and $a^{hyp}$.\n-   **Cross to $a^0$**: The resulting trans-heterozygote has genotype $m_A/a^0$ at gene $A$. The rest of the genome contributes its full wild-type activity. The total activity is $F_1 = (f_{m_A} + f_{a^0}) + (\\text{activity from other genes})$.\n    Using our two-gene model for simplicity, the genotype is $m_A/a^0_A ; +_B/+_B$. Total activity is $F_1 = (f_{m_A} + 0) + (1+1) = 2+f_{m_A}$.\n    Since $m_A$ is a recessive mutation, $f_{m_A}$ is small (and non-negative). As established, $2+2f_{m_A} < T$. Since $f_{m_A} \\ge 0$, it follows that $2+f_{m_A} \\le 2+2f_{m_A}$. Therefore, $2+f_{m_A} < T$.\n    The phenotype is mutant. This is **non-complementation**.\n-   **Cross to $a^{hyp}$**: The genotype is $m_A/a^{hyp}$. The total activity is $F_2 = (f_{m_A} + f_{a^{hyp}}) + (1+1) = 2+f_{m_A}+\\alpha$.\n    Combining two damaged alleles of the same gene is the classic test for allelism and is expected to fail. Neither allele can provide the function of a wild-type allele. Even though $F_2 > F_1$, it is extremely unlikely to reach the threshold $T$. To fail to complement means $2+f_{m_A}+\\alpha < T$. This is the expected result, barring rare intracistronic complementation.\n    The phenotype is mutant. This is **non-complementation**.\n\n**Conclusion for Scenario 1 (Allelism)**: The mutation $m$ will fail to complement both $a^0$ and $a^{hyp}$.\n\n**Scenario 2: Dosage-Sensitive Non-Allelic Non-Complementation**\nThe mutation $m$ is in a different gene, say Gene $B$. Let's call it $m_B$. Gene $B$ shows dosage-sensitive interaction with Gene $A$.\n-   **Cross to $a^0$**: The resulting trans-heterozygote has genotype $+_A/a^0_A ; +_B/m_B$. This individual has only one functional copy of Gene $A$ and one functional copy of Gene $B$.\n    The total activity is $F_3 = (f_+ + f_{a^0}) + (f_+ + f_{m_B}) = (1+0) + (1+f_{m_B}) = 2+f_{m_B}$.\n    The premise of dosage-sensitive non-allelic non-complementation is that this very genotype is non-functional. Thus, by definition, $2+f_{m_B} < T$.\n    The phenotype is mutant. This is **non-complementation**.\n-   **Cross to $a^{hyp}$**: The genotype is $+_A/a^{hyp}_A ; +_B/m_B$.\n    The total activity is $F_4 = (f_+ + f_{a^{hyp}}) + (f_+ + f_{m_B}) = (1+\\alpha) + (1+f_{m_B}) = 2+f_{m_B}+\\alpha$.\n    We know $F_3 = 2+f_{m_B} < T$. The activity here, $F_4$, is greater than $F_3$ by the amount $\\alpha$. Since $0 < \\alpha < 1$, it is entirely possible that this extra activity is sufficient to push the total above the threshold. That is, it is possible that $F_4 = (2+f_{m_B}) + \\alpha \\ge T$. This is the basis of the experimental design: the hypomorphic \"leaky\" allele provides a small functional boost that the null allele cannot.\n    The phenotype can be wild type. This is **complementation**.\n\n**Conclusion for Scenario 2 (Dosage Sensitivity)**: The mutation $m$ will fail to complement $a^0$ but has the potential to complement $a^{hyp}$.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**\n-   **True Allelism ($m$ in Gene $A$)**: Fails to complement $a^0$. Fails to complement $a^{hyp}$.\n-   **Dosage Sensitivity ($m$ in Gene $B$)**: Fails to complement $a^0$. Complements $a^{hyp}$.\n\nThis provides a clear diagnostic rule.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Cross each $m_i$ to both $a^0$ and $a^{hyp}$. If a given $m_i$ shows non-complementation with $a^0$ but complements with $a^{hyp}$, infer dosage-sensitive non-allelic non-complementation (the hypomorph supplies enough activity to pass the threshold when combined with $m_i$); if the same $m_i$ fails to complement both $a^0$ and $a^{hyp}$, infer that $m_i$ is an allele of $A$ (true allelism).**\nThis option perfectly matches our derived diagnostic rule. The logic described for distinguishing the two scenarios is correct, and the parenthetical explanation is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Cross each $m_i$ to both $a^0$ and $a^{hyp}$. If a given $m_i$ shows non-complementation with $a^{hyp}$ but complements with $a^0$, infer dosage sensitivity; if it fails to complement both, infer that $m_i$ is in a different gene from $A$.**\nThe first condition, \"non-complementation with $a^{hyp}$ but complements with $a^0$,\" is impossible under the additive model. The activity with $a^{hyp}$ is always greater than or equal to the activity with $a^0$. If the system meets the threshold with $a^0$, it must also meet it with $a^{hyp}$. The second inference, \"fails to complement both, infer that $m_i$ is in a different gene from $A$,\" contradicts our finding that this pattern indicates true allelism (i.e., $m_i$ is in gene $A$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Cross each $m_i$ to both $a^0$ and $a^{hyp}$. If a given $m_i$ fails to complement both $a^0$ and $a^{hyp}$ but complements $+$, infer dosage-sensitive non-allelic non-complementation; if it complements both $a^0$ and $a^{hyp}$, infer true allelism.**\nThe first inference is wrong; failing to complement both testers indicates true allelism, not dosage sensitivity. The \"complements +\" clause is uninformative, as all recessive mutations do this by definition. The second inference is also wrong. If $m_i$ complements $a^0$, it cannot be an allele of $A$. True allelism requires non-complementation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Cross each $m_i$ only to $a^0$. If a given $m_i$ complements $a^0$, infer that it is not in $A$; if it fails to complement $a^0$, infer dosage sensitivity. The $a^{hyp}$ cross is unnecessary and potentially confounding because it changes the genetic background.**\nThe inference \"if it fails to complement $a^0$, infer dosage sensitivity\" is flawed. As shown in our derivation, non-complementation with $a^0$ occurs in *both* true allelism and dosage sensitivity. Therefore, the cross to $a^0$ alone is insufficient to distinguish the two scenarios. The claim that the $a^{hyp}$ cross is \"unnecessary\" is false; it is the crucial second step required to resolve the ambiguity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2801133"}]}
