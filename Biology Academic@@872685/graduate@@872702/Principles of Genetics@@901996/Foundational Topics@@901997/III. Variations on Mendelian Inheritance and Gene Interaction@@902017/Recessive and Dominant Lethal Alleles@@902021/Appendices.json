It is a standard problem in transmission genetics involving viability selection. We will proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem describes a cross between a heterozygous parent of genotype $Aa$ and a homozygous wild-type parent of genotype $aa$. The allele $A$ is a dominant lethal with complete penetrance in the offspring generation, while $a$ is the wild-type allele.\n\nFirst, we determine the frequency of gametes produced by each parent based on Mendel's law of segregation.\nThe heterozygous parent, with genotype $Aa$, produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, in equal proportions. The frequency of each gamete type is therefore $1/2$.\n$$f(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$f(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe homozygous parent, with genotype $aa$, produces only one type of gamete, $a$. The frequency is $1$.\n$$f(a) = 1$$\n\nNext, we establish the expected genotypic frequencies among the zygotes at conception by considering the random fusion of these gametes. This can be visualized with a Punnett square or calculated directly from gamete frequencies.\n\nThe cross is $Aa \\times aa$.\nThe possible zygotic genotypes are $Aa$ and $aa$.\nThe frequency of zygotes with genotype $Aa$, denoted $p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})}$, is the product of the frequency of the $A$ gamete from the heterozygous parent and the $a$ gamete from the homozygous parent:\n$$p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} = f(A)_{\\text{parent 1}} \\times f(a)_{\\text{parent 2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe frequency of zygotes with genotype $aa$, denoted $p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})}$, is the product of the frequency of the $a$ gamete from the heterozygous parent and the $a$ gamete from the homozygous parent:\n$$p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} = f(a)_{\\text{parent 1}} \\times f(a)_{\\text{parent 2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe initial distribution of genotypes among all conceptions (zygotes) is $1/2$ for $Aa$ and $1/2$ for $aa$. The sum of these frequencies is $p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} + p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$.\n\nNow, we apply the process of viability selection. The problem states that the dominant allele $A$ is lethal with complete penetrance, causing death before birth. This means any zygote carrying at least one $A$ allele will not survive. We define the viability, $v$, for each genotype:\n- For genotype $Aa$, viability $v_{Aa} = 0$.\n- For genotype $aa$ (wild-type), viability $v_{aa} = 1$.\n\nThe fraction of total conceptions that survive to birth, $s$, is the sum of the initial zygotic frequencies multiplied by their respective viabilities.\n$$s = (p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} \\times v_{Aa}) + (p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} \\times v_{aa})$$\n$$s = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 0\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1\\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, the expected fraction of all conceptions that survive to birth is $s = 1/2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected genotype distribution among the live-born offspring. The frequency of a given genotype among the survivors is its surviving fraction (initial frequency times viability) divided by the total survival fraction, $s$.\n\nThe expected frequency of genotype $aa$ among live-born offspring, $p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})}$, is:\n$$p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})} = \\frac{p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} \\times v_{aa}}{s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1$$\n\nThe expected frequency of genotype $Aa$ among live-born offspring, $p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})}$, is:\n$$p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})} = \\frac{p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} \\times v_{Aa}}{s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 0}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 0$$\n\nAll live-born offspring will have the genotype $aa$. The required values are $p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})} = 1$, $p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})} = 0$, and $s = 1/2$.

It describes a standard scenario in transmission genetics involving linkage, recombination, and selection in the form of a lethal allele. The task is to derive a maximum likelihood estimate, a fundamental procedure in statistical genetics. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient for deriving a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the set of probabilities for the four potential progeny classes arising from a testcross of an $F_{1}$ individual with genotype $A B / a b$. The gametes produced by this $F_{1}$ parent are of four types. The parental, or nonrecombinant, gametes are $A B$ and $a b$. The recombinant gametes are $A b$ and $a B$. The recombination fraction, $\\theta$, is the proportion of gametes that are recombinant. By definition, the total frequency of recombinant gametes is $\\theta$, and the total frequency of nonrecombinant gametes is $1-\\theta$. Assuming no segregation distortion, each specific gamete type within a class (recombinant or nonrecombinant) is equally probable.\n\nThus, the frequencies of the four gamete types from the $A B / a b$ parent are:\n- $P(AB \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(ab \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(Ab \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(aB \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\n\nThe testcross parent is of genotype $a b / a b$ and produces only one type of gamete, $a b$, with probability $1$. The genotypes of the zygotic progeny are therefore determined solely by the gamete from the $F_{1}$ parent. The pre-selection probabilities of the four progeny genotypes are equal to the frequencies of the corresponding gamete from the $F_{1}$ parent:\n- $P(A B / a b) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(a b / a b) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(A b / a b) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(a B / a b) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\nFor simplicity, we denote the phenotypes by the alleles from the $F_1$ parent: $AB$, $ab$, $Ab$, $aB$.\n\nThe problem states that the $Ab$ genotype is lethal. This means all individuals of this class die and are not observed. The sample space of observed progeny is therefore restricted to the three viable classes: $AB$, $ab$, and $aB$. To find the probabilities of observing these classes, we must condition on viability. The total probability of a zygote being viable is the sum of the probabilities of the viable genotypes:\n$$P(\\text{viable}) = P(AB) + P(ab) + P(aB) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2} + \\frac{1-\\theta}{2} + \\frac{\\theta}{2} = 1 - \\theta + \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{2-\\theta}{2}$$\nThe conditional probabilities, denoted $p_{phenotype}$, for the three viable phenotypes are:\n$$p_{AB} = P(AB | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(AB)}{P(\\text{viable})} = \\frac{(1-\\theta)/2}{(2-\\theta)/2} = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2-\\theta}$$\n$$p_{ab} = P(ab | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(ab)}{P(\\text{viable})} = \\frac{(1-\\theta)/2}{(2-\\theta)/2} = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2-\\theta}$$\n$$p_{aB} = P(aB | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(aB)}{P(\\text{viable})} = \\frac{\\theta/2}{(2-\\theta)/2} = \\frac{\\theta}{2-\\theta}$$\n\nWe are given the observed counts for these classes: $n_{AB}$, $n_{ab}$, and $n_{aB}$. The total number of observed, viable progeny is $N = n_{AB} + n_{ab} + n_{aB}$. The data follow a multinomial distribution with these probabilities.
