It provides a standard biophysical model of chromosome mechanics based on Hooke's law and the principles of parallel elastic elements. All necessary parameters are provided, the terminology is precise, and the objective is clearly defined.

Each homolog consists of two sister chromatids joined by centromeric cohesion and bearing paired sister kinetochores. Use the following foundational principles as your starting point: (i) in meiosis I, the normal outcome requires co-orientation of sister kinetochores on each homolog such that both sisters attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole, enabling reductional segregation of homologs; (ii) centromeric cohesion is retained through meiosis I to keep sister chromatids together, and is released in meiosis II; (iii) in meiosis II, the normal outcome requires bi-orientation of sister kinetochores so that sister chromatids segregate equationally.\n\nAssume the following minimal and self-consistent probabilistic model for one specific chromosome pair:\n- With probability $s_{I}$, sister kinetochores correctly co-orient at meiosis I, homologs bi-orient to opposite poles, and reductional segregation occurs at anaphase I.

It is therefore valid for rigorous analysis. The solution requires a qualitative description of meiotic segregation, the derivation of a probabilistic formula, and a numerical calculation.\n\nThe first task is to deduce the segregation patterns based on the provided principles. Let us denote the two homologous chromosomes as $H_1$ and $H_2$. In the bivalent, $H_1$ consists of sister chromatids $C_{1a}$ and $C_{1b}$, and $H_2$ consists of $C_{2a}$ and $C_{2b}$.\n\nUnder correct segregation, both Meiosis I and Meiosis II proceed without error.\nIn Meiosis I, correct co-orientation of sister kinetochores leads to reductional segregation. The homologous chromosomes $H_1$ and $H_2$ move to opposite poles. This produces two secondary meiocytes, one containing $H_1$ (the joined chromatids $C_{1a}$ and $C_{1b}$) and the other containing $H_2$ (the joined chromatids $C_{2a}$ and $C_{2b}$).\nIn Meiosis II, correct bi-orientation of sister kinetochores leads to equational segregation. In the first secondary meiocyte, sister chromatids $C_{1a}$ and $C_{1b}$ separate, yielding two gametes, one with $C_{1a}$ and one with $C_{1b}$. In the second secondary meiocyte, $C_{2a}$ and $C_{2b}$ separate, yielding two gametes, one with $C_{2a}$ and one with $C_{2b}$. The final result is four genetically distinct but chromosomally normal (euploid) gametes, each containing a single chromosome.\n\nFailure can occur at two stages as per the model.\nFailure mode $1$: Nondisjunction at Meiosis I. This occurs if co-orientation fails. Both homologous chromosomes, $H_1$ and $H_2$, are segregated to the same spindle pole. This results in one secondary meiocyte that is disomic for this chromosome (containing both $H_1$ and $H_2$) and one secondary meiocyte that is nullisomic (containing no copies of this chromosome). The subsequent Meiosis II division of the nullisomic cell produces two nullisomic gametes. The disomic cell produces two disomic gametes (assuming the two homologs segregate to different cells at Meiosis II, which is itself an equational division). A nullisomic gamete has $n-1$ chromosomes and a disomic gamete has $n+1$ chromosomes. Both are aneuploid. Thus, a single Meiosis I nondisjunction event produces four aneuploid gametes.\n\nFailure mode $2$: Nondisjunction at Meiosis II. This occurs conditional on a successful Meiosis I. One of the two secondary meiocytes (for instance, the one containing $H_1$) experiences a failure of sister chromatid separation. Both sister chromatids, $C_{1a}$ and $C_{1b}$, are segregated to the same pole. This division produces one disomic gamete (containing both $C_{1a}$ and $C_{1b}$) and one nullisomic gamete. Both are aneuploid. If the other secondary meiocyte (containing $H_2$) undergoes a correct Meiosis II, it produces two normal, euploid gametes. The overall output from this scenario is two aneuploid gametes and two euploid gametes.\n\nThe second task is to derive a closed-form expression for the probability that a randomly chosen gamete is aneuploid. Let $A$ be the event that a randomly chosen gamete is aneuploid. Let $M_I$ be the event of a successful Meiosis I segregation and $M_I^c$ be its complement (Meiosis I nondisjunction). The probabilities are given as $P(M_I) = s_{I}$ and $P(M_I^c) = 1 - s_{I}$. We apply the law of total probability:\n$$P(A) = P(A | M_I) P(M_I) + P(A | M_I^c) P(M_I^c)$$\nFirst, we evaluate the conditional probability of aneuploidy given a Meiosis I failure, $P(A | M_I^c)$. As established, if Meiosis I nondisjunction occurs, all four resulting gametes are aneuploid. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting an aneuploid gamete from this pool is $1$.\n$$P(A | M_I^c) = 1$$\nNext, we evaluate the conditional probability of aneuploidy given a successful Meiosis I, $P(A | M_I)$. If Meiosis I is successful, two normal secondary meiocytes are formed. A randomly chosen gamete has an equal chance of originating from either of the two independent Meiosis II divisions. Let's consider the specific Meiosis II division that produces our chosen gamete. According to the problem, this division is successful with probability $s_{II}$, producing euploid gametes. It fails with probability $1 - s_{II}$, producing aneuploid gametes. Therefore, the probability that our chosen gamete is aneuploid, given that its Meiosis I precursor was normal, is simply the probability that its specific Meiosis II division failed.\n$$P(A | M_I) = 1 - s_{II}$$\nSubstituting these conditional probabilities into the law of total probability formula:\n$$P(A) = (1 - s_{II}) \\cdot s_{I} + (1) \\cdot (1 - s_{I})$$\n$$P(A) = s_{I} - s_{I} s_{II} + 1 - s_{I}$$\n$$P(A) = 1 - s_{I} s_{II}$$\nThis expression represents the probability that a randomly chosen gamete is aneuploid. An alternative, simpler derivation confirms this result. A gamete is euploid if and only if it is the product of a successful Meiosis I AND a successful Meiosis II. The probability of this joint event, given independence, is $P(\\text{euploid}) = s_{I} s_{II}$. The event of being aneuploid is the complement, so its probability is $P(\\text{aneuploid}) = 1 - P(\\text{euploid}) = 1 - s_{I} s_{II}$.\n\nThe third and final task is to evaluate this probability for the given values $s_{I} = 0.98$ and $s_{II} = 0.99$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$P(A) = 1 - (0.98)(0.99)$$\n$$P(A) = 1 - 0.9702$$\n$$P(A) = 0.0298$$\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.
