Two true-breeding (inbred) lines are used as the parental generation (P).\n- Line A is homozygous for alleles that result in small fruit. Its genotype at a specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) influencing fruit weight is denoted as $q_1q_1$.\n- Line B is homozygous for alleles that result in large fruit. Its genotype at the same QTL is $q_2q_2$.\n\nA codominant molecular marker, M, has been identified that is very tightly linked to this QTL, meaning that the marker and the QTL are almost always inherited together. Line A has the marker genotype $M_1M_1$, and Line B has the marker genotype $M_2M_2$.\n\nThe geneticist crosses Line A and Line B to produce an F1 generation, and then self-pollinates individuals from the F1 generation to create a large F2 population. In the F2 population, each plant is genotyped for the marker locus (M), and their average fruit weight is measured. This allows the F2 population to be sorted into three distinct groups based on their marker genotype: $M_1M_1$, $M_1M_2$, and $M_2M_2$. Let $W_{11}$, $W_{12}$, and $W_{22}$ represent the mean fruit weight for F2 plants with marker genotypes $M_1M_1$, $M_1M_2$, and $M_2M_2$, respectively.\n\nThe geneticist wants to determine the mode of gene action at the $q$ locus. Which of the following statements correctly describes the expected relationship between the mean fruit weights of the three marker classes for two different genetic scenarios?\n\n**Scenario I:** The $q$ locus exhibits purely additive gene action.\n**Scenario II:** The allele for large fruit, $q_2$, is completely dominant over the allele for small fruit, $q_1$.\n\nA.

Scenario I: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{22}$", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the phenotypic relationship (mean fruit weight) among F2 individuals grouped by their genotype at a molecular marker $M$. This marker is tightly linked to a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL), $q$, which influences fruit weight.\n\nFirst, let's establish the genotypes of the different generations.\nThe parental lines are:\n- Line A: $M_1q_1 / M_1q_1$. This line has small fruit. The mean weight corresponds to the $q_1q_1$ genotype.\n- Line B: $M_2q_2 / M_2q_2$. This line has large fruit. The mean weight corresponds to the $q_2q_2$ genotype.\n\nThe F1 generation is a cross between Line A and Line B, so all F1 individuals will be heterozygous: $M_1q_1 / M_2q_2$.\n\nThe F2 generation is produced by self-pollinating the F1 generation. Since the marker $M$ and the QTL $q$ are tightly linked, we can assume no recombination occurs between them. Therefore, the F1 individuals produce two types of gametes: $M_1q_1$ and $M_2q_2$. Random fertilization of these gametes leads to the F2 genotypes in a 1:2:1 ratio:\n- 1/4 of F2 will have genotype $M_1q_1 / M_1q_1$. At the marker locus, this is genotype $M_1M_1$. At the QTL, this is genotype $q_1q_1$. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{11}$.\n- 2/4 of F2 will have genotype $M_1q_1 / M_2q_2$. At the marker locus, this is genotype $M_1M_2$. At the QTL, this is genotype $q_1q_2$. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{12}$.\n- 1/4 of F2 will have genotype $M_2q_2 / M_2q_2$. At the marker locus, this is genotype $M_2M_2$. At the QTL, this is genotype $q_2q_2$. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{22}$.\n\nFrom the problem description, $q_1q_1$ results in small fruit and $q_2q_2$ results in large fruit. Therefore, we know that $W_{11}  W_{22}$. Now we can analyze the two scenarios for the heterozygote $q_1q_2$.\n\n**Scenario I: Additive Gene Action**\nIn the case of purely additive gene action, the phenotype of the heterozygote is exactly intermediate between the phenotypes of the two homozygotes. The effect of each allele on the phenotype is additive. Thus, the mean fruit weight of the heterozygous $q_1q_2$ individuals will be the arithmetic mean of the weights of the $q_1q_1$ and $q_2q_2$ individuals.\nThe $M_1M_2$ marker class corresponds to the $q_1q_2$ QTL genotype. Therefore, the mean weight $W_{12}$ will be the average of $W_{11}$ (from $q_1q_1$) and $W_{22}$ (from $q_2q_2$).\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$W_{12} = \\frac{W_{11} + W_{22}}{2}$$\n\n**Scenario II: Complete Dominance of $q_2$ over $q_1$**\nIn the case of complete dominance, the phenotype of the heterozygote is identical to the phenotype of the dominant homozygote. The problem states that $q_2$ (large fruit) is completely dominant over $q_1$ (small fruit).\nThis means that individuals with the $q_1q_2$ genotype will have the same phenotype (large fruit) as individuals with the $q_2q_2$ genotype.\nThe $M_1M_2$ marker class corresponds to the $q_1q_2$ QTL genotype, and the $M_2M_2$ marker class corresponds to the $q_2q_2$ QTL genotype. Therefore, the mean weight of the $M_1M_2$ group will be equal to the mean weight of the $M_2M_2$ group.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$W_{12} = W_{22}$$\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy combining the results from both scenarios, we get:\n- For Scenario I (Additive): $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$\n- For Scenario II (Dominant $q_2$): $W_{12} = W_{22}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA. Scenario I: $W_{12} = W_{11}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{22}$ (Incorrect for Scenario I)\nB. Scenario I: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{11}$ (Incorrect for Scenario II, this would be dominance of $q_1$)\nC. Scenario I: $W_{12} = W_{22}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$ (Incorrect, scenarios are swapped)\nD. Scenario I: $W_{12} > W_{22}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{11}$ (Incorrect for both scenarios; first part suggests overdominance)\nE. Scenario I: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{22}$ (Correct for both scenarios)\n\nThus, option E correctly describes the expected relationships for both scenarios.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1501642"}, {"introduction": "Moving from conceptual patterns to rigorous analysis, this practice delves into the core statistical engine of QTL mapping.

The problem is complete, consistent, and scientifically valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution is now warranted.\n\nWe begin by modeling the expected phenotypic value for each genotype class based on the given linear model, $y=\\mu + a\\,x + d\\,z + \\varepsilon$.

The solution is derived from the fundamental principles of likelihood-ratio tests in Gaussian linear models.\n\nFirst, we establish the statistical model. For a balanced backcross population, there are two possible genotypes at the QTL, occurring in equal frequency ($1/2$). Let the phenotypic value of the $i$-th individual be $y_i$. We can model the phenotype using a linear regression on a dummy variable $x_i$ representing the genotype. We code the two genotypes as $x_i = -1/2$ and $x_i = +1/2$. The model is:\n$$ y_i = \\mu + \\beta x_i + \\epsilon_i $$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the overall mean phenotype, $\\beta$ is the additive effect of the QTL (representing the difference in mean phenotype between the two genotypic classes), and $\\epsilon_i$ are independent and identically distributed residual errors, assumed to follow a normal distribution $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma_e^2)$.\n\nThe total phenotypic variance, $V_P$, is the variance of $y_i$.

For a balanced backcross, $E[x_i] = \\frac{1}{2}(-1/2) + \\frac{1}{2}(+1/2) = 0$, and $E[x_i^2] = \\frac{1}{2}(-1/2)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(+1/2)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{4}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{4}) = 1/4$.

The target power is $0.80$.\n$$ \\text{Power} = P(\\Lambda \\ge C | H_1) = P(\\chi^2_1(\\lambda) \\ge C) = 0.80 $$\nTo solve for $\\lambda$, we use the property that a random variable $Y \\sim \\chi^2_1(\\lambda)$ can be represented as $Y = (Z + \\sqrt{\\lambda})^2$, where $Z \\sim N(0,1)$ is a standard normal variable.\n$$ P((Z+\\sqrt{\\lambda})^2 \\ge C) = 0.80 $$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$ P(Z + \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\ge \\sqrt{C}) + P(Z + \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\le -\\sqrt{C}) = 0.80 $$\n$$ P(Z \\ge \\sqrt{C} - \\sqrt{\\lambda}) + P(Z \\le -\\sqrt{C} - \\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 0.80 $$\nThe second term, $P(Z \\le -\\sqrt{C} - \\sqrt{\\lambda})$, is negligible for typical values of $C$ and $\\lambda$. Thus, we can approximate the power as:\n$$ P(Z \\ge \\sqrt{C} - \\sqrt{\\lambda}) \\approx 0.80 $$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Then $1 - \\Phi(\\sqrt{C} - \\sqrt{\\lambda}) \\approx 0.80$, which implies $\\Phi(\\sqrt{C} - \\sqrt{\\lambda}) \\approx 0.20$.\nLet $z_{0.20}$ be the 20th percentile of the standard normal distribution, such that $\\Phi(z_{0.20}) = 0.20$. From standard tables, $z_{0.20} \\approx -0.84162$.\n$$ \\sqrt{C} - \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\approx z_{0.20} \\implies \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\approx \\sqrt{C} - z_{0.20} $$\nSubstituting the values for $C$ and $z_{0.20}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{C} = \\sqrt{7 \\ln(10)} \\approx \\sqrt{7 \\times 2.302585} \\approx \\sqrt{16.118095} \\approx 4.014735 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\approx 4.014735 - (-0.84162) = 4.014735 + 0.84162 = 4.856355 $$\nSquaring to find the required NCP $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda \\approx (4.856355)^2 \\approx 23.58418 $$\n\nFinally, we find the sample size $n$ using the relation $\\lambda = n/9$:\n$$ n = 9 \\lambda \\approx 9 \\times 23.58418 \\approx 212.2576 $$\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer and the power must be at least $0.80$, we must round up to the next whole number.\n$$ n = 213 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{213}$$", "id": "2827172"}]}
