Consider a single autosomal locus with two alleles, $A$ and $a$, with allele frequency $p$ for $A$ and $q=1-p$ for $a$. The mating structure is summarized by the within-individual inbreeding coefficient $F$ in the sense of Sewall Wright: $F$ is the probability that the two alleles at a locus in a randomly chosen individual are identical by descent.

It requires the derivation of genotype and phenotype frequencies under a model of inbreeding, followed by a numerical calculation. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient, $F$, is defined as the probability that the two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent (IBD). The complementary probability, $1-F$, is the probability that they are not IBD. We can derive the genotype frequencies by considering these two possibilities for a randomly chosen individual.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of allele $A$ and $q=1-p$ be the frequency of allele $a$ in the population's gene pool. The evolutionary forces of selection, mutation, and migration are assumed to be absent, so these allele frequencies remain constant across the generation of interest.\n\n1.  **Alleles are IBD**: This occurs with probability $F$. If the two alleles are IBD, they must be the same allele. The probability that the ancestral allele was $A$ is $p$, leading to an $AA$ genotype. The probability that the ancestral allele was $a$ is $q$, leading to an $aa$ genotype. Therefore, the contribution to genotype frequencies from IBD alleles is $Fp$ for $AA$ and $Fq$ for $aa$. There can be no heterozygotes from this pathway.\n\n2.  **Alleles are not IBD**: This occurs with probability $1-F$. If the alleles are not IBD, they can be considered as two independent draws from the gene pool. In this case, the genotype frequencies are given by the Hardy–Weinberg law: $p^2$ for $AA$, $2pq$ for $Aa$, and $q^2$ for $aa$. The contribution to the total genotype frequencies from this non-IBD pathway is $(1-F)p^2$ for $AA$, $(1-F)2pq$ for $Aa$, and $(1-F)q^2$ for $aa$.\n\nBy summing the probabilities from these two mutually exclusive pathways, we obtain the genotype frequencies under inbreeding:\nThe frequency of the homozygous genotype $AA$, denoted $f(AA)$, is:\n$$f(AA) = Fp + (1-F)p^2 = Fp + p^2 - Fp^2 = p^2 + Fp(1-p) = p^2 + Fpq$$\nThe frequency of the heterozygous genotype $Aa$, denoted $f(Aa)$, is:\n$$f(Aa) = F \\cdot 0 + (1-F)2pq = 2pq(1-F)$$\nThe frequency of the homozygous genotype $aa$, denoted $f(aa)$, is:\n$$f(aa) = Fq + (1-F)q^2 = Fq + q^2 - Fq^2 = q^2 + Fq(1-q) = q^2 + Fpq$$\n\nThese are the general expressions for genotype frequencies for a single locus with two alleles under an inbreeding coefficient of $F$. As a check, their sum is $f(AA) + f(Aa) + f(aa) = (p^2+Fpq) + (2pq-2Fpq) + (q^2+Fpq) = p^2+2pq+q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1$, which is correct.\n\nNext, we establish the proportions of phenotypes. The problem states complete dominance of allele $A$ over allele $a$. This means individuals with genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$ will express the dominant phenotype, while individuals with genotype $aa$ will express the recessive phenotype.\n\nThe proportion of the dominant phenotype is the sum of the frequencies of the $AA$ and $Aa$ genotypes:\n$$\\text{Proportion(Dominant)} = f(AA) + f(Aa) = (p^2 + Fpq) + 2pq(1-F) = p^2 + Fpq + 2pq - 2Fpq = p^2 + 2pq - Fpq$$\nA more convenient form is derived by noting that the total proportion must be $1$:\n$$\\text{Proportion(Dominant)} = 1 - f(aa) = 1 - (q^2 + Fpq)$$\n\nThe proportion of the recessive phenotype is simply the frequency of the $aa$ genotype:\n$$\\text{Proportion(Recessive)} = f(aa) = q^2 + Fpq$$\n\nWe are given the specific values $p = 0.2$ and $F = 0.3$.\nFrom this, we calculate the frequency of the recessive allele $a$:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\n\nNow we substitute these numerical values into the expressions for phenotype proportions.\nFirst, we calculate the proportion of the recessive phenotype:\n$$\\text{Proportion(Recessive)} = q^2 + Fpq = (0.8)^2 + (0.3)(0.2)(0.8)$$\n$$\\text{Proportion(Recessive)} = 0.64 + (0.3)(0.16) = 0.64 + 0.048 = 0.688$$\n\nNext, we calculate the proportion of the dominant phenotype. Since there are only two phenotypes, this proportion must be $1$ minus the proportion of the recessive phenotype.\n$$\\text{Proportion(Dominant)} = 1 - \\text{Proportion(Recessive)} = 1 - 0.688 = 0.312$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair of phenotype proportions in the form \"dominant, recessive\".

With probability $1-\\alpha$, $G_2$ is chosen randomly from the population with probability $P_{G_2}$.\n\nLet us determine the frequency of each type of mating pair.

This is the weighted average of the allele frequencies in the two subpopulations, where the weights are their relative contributions to the pool.\n$$p_T = w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$p_T = (0.30)(0.20) + (0.70)(0.80) = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62$$\nThe frequency of allele $a$ in the total population, $q_T$, is therefore:\n$$q_T = 1 - p_T = 1 - 0.62 = 0.38$$\nThe expected heterozygosity, $H_{\\mathrm{exp}}$, is the frequency of heterozygotes ($Aa$) expected under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for the total population with allele frequencies $p_T$ and $q_T$.\n$$H_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 2 p_T q_T$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 2 (0.62)(0.38) = 0.4712$$\n\nNext, we calculate the \"observed\" heterozygosity of the pooled sample, $H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The problem states that each subpopulation is in HWE. This means the actual frequency of heterozygotes within subpopulation $S_i$ is given by $H_i = 2 p_i q_i$. The pooled observed heterozygosity is the weighted average of these within-subpopulation heterozygosities.\n\nFor subpopulation $S_1$:\nThe frequency of allele $a$ is $q_1 = 1 - p_1 = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\nThe heterozygosity is $H_1 = 2 p_1 q_1 = 2 (0.20)(0.80) = 0.32$.\n\nFor subpopulation $S_2$:\nThe frequency of allele $a$ is $q_2 = 1 - p_2 = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\nThe heterozygosity is $H_2 = 2 p_2 q_2 = 2 (0.80)(0.20) = 0.32$.\n\nThe pooled observed heterozygosity, $H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the weighted average of $H_1$ and $H_2$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = w_1 H_1 + w_2 H_2$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (0.30)(0.32) + (0.70)(0.32) = (0.30 + 0.70)(0.32) = (1.0)(0.32) = 0.32$$\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the index as defined in the problem statement:\n$$F_{IS} = 1 - \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{H_{\\mathrm{exp}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{exp}}$:\n$$F_{IS} = 1 - \\frac{0.32}{0.4712}$$\n$$F_{IS} = 1 - 0.679117147...$$\n$$F_{IS} = 0.320882852...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F_{IS} \\approx 0.3209$$\nThis result quantifies the deficit of heterozygotes in the pooled sample compared to Hardy-Weinberg expectations for that sample, a direct consequence of the Wahlund effect due to population subdivision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3209}$$", "id": "2832903"}]}
