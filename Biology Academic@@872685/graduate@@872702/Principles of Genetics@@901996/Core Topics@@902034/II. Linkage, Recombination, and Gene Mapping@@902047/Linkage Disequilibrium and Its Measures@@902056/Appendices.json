It requires the computation of standard measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) from given haplotype count data. We shall proceed with a systematic, step-by-step calculation based on fundamental definitions in population genetics.\n\nThe analysis begins with the provided data for a sample of $N=100$ phased chromosomes. The observed counts for the four possible haplotypes at two biallelic loci, $A/a$ and $B/b$, are:\n- $n_{AB} = 34$\n- $n_{Ab} = 6$\n- $n_{aB} = 10$\n- $n_{ab} = 50$\n\nThe sum of these counts is $34 + 6 + 10 + 50 = 100$, which matches the total sample size $N$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the observed haplotype frequencies, denoted by $p$ with the corresponding haplotype as a subscript. The frequency of a haplotype is its count divided by the total number of chromosomes in the sample.\n\nThe frequency of the $AB$ haplotype is:\n$$p_{AB} = \\frac{n_{AB}}{N} = \\frac{34}{100} = 0.34$$\nThe frequency of the $Ab$ haplotype is:\n$$p_{Ab} = \\frac{n_{Ab}}{N} = \\frac{6}{100} = 0.06$$\nThe frequency of the $aB$ haplotype is:\n$$p_{aB} = \\frac{n_{aB}}{N} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.10$$\nThe frequency of the $ab$ haplotype is:\n$$p_{ab} = \\frac{n_{ab}}{N} = \\frac{50}{100} = 0.50$$\nThe sum of these frequencies must be unity: $p_{AB} + p_{Ab} + p_{aB} + p_{ab} = 0.34 + 0.06 + 0.10 + 0.50 = 1.00$.\n\nNext, we calculate the marginal allele frequencies for each locus from the haplotype frequencies.\n\nFor the first locus ($A/a$):\nThe frequency of allele $A$, denoted $p_A$, is the sum of frequencies of haplotypes containing $A$:\n$$p_A = p_{AB} + p_{Ab} = 0.34 + 0.06 = 0.40$$\nThe frequency of allele $a$, denoted $p_a$, is the sum of frequencies of haplotypes containing $a$:\n$$p_a = p_{aB} + p_{ab} = 0.10 + 0.50 = 0.60$$\nAs a check, $p_A + p_a = 0.40 + 0.60 = 1.00$.\n\nFor the second locus ($B/b$):\nThe frequency of allele $B$, denoted $p_B$, is the sum of frequencies of haplotypes containing $B$:\n$$p_B = p_{AB} + p_{aB} = 0.34 + 0.10 = 0.44$$\nThe frequency of allele $b$, denoted $p_b$, is the sum of frequencies of haplotypes containing $b$:\n$$p_b = p_{Ab} + p_{ab} = 0.06 + 0.50 = 0.56$$\nAs a check, $p_B + p_b = 0.44 + 0.56 = 1.00$.\n\nNow we compute the linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D$. Linkage disequilibrium measures the non-random association of alleles at different loci. $D$ is defined as the difference between the observed frequency of a haplotype (e.g., $AB$) and the expected frequency if the alleles were associated randomly (i.e., at linkage equilibrium). The expected frequency of the $AB$ haplotype under equilibrium is the product of the marginal allele frequencies, $p_A p_B$.\n\n$$D = p_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$D = 0.34 - (0.40 \\times 0.44) = 0.34 - 0.176 = 0.164$$\nThe positive value of $D$ indicates an excess of $AB$ haplotypes (and consequently $ab$ haplotypes) compared to the expectation under independence.\n\nNext, we compute the normalized linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D'$. This metric scales $D$ to the range $[-1, 1]$ by dividing it by its maximum possible absolute value given the allele frequencies. The bounds for $D$ are given by:\n$$\\max(-p_A p_B, -p_a p_b) \\le D \\le \\min(p_A p_b, p_a p_B)$$\nSince our calculated $D = 0.164$ is positive, we use the upper bound, $D_{max}$, for normalization:\n$$D_{max} = \\min(p_A p_b, p_a p_B)$$\nWe calculate the terms inside the minimum function:\n$$p_A p_b = 0.40 \\times 0.56 = 0.224$$\n$$p_a p_B = 0.60 \\times 0.44 = 0.264$$\nThus, $D_{max} = \\min(0.224, 0.264) = 0.224$.\nThe normalized coefficient $D'$ is then:\n$$D' = \\frac{D}{D_{max}} = \\frac{0.164}{0.224} \\approx 0.7321428...$$\n\nFinally, we compute the squared correlation coefficient, $r^2$, another common measure of LD. It is related to the chi-square statistic for association and ranges from $0$ (no association) to $1$ (complete association). The formula is:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{(0.164)^2}{(0.40)(0.60)(0.44)(0.56)} = \\frac{0.026896}{0.24 \\times 0.2464} = \\frac{0.026896}{0.059136} \\approx 0.4548498...$$\n\nThe problem requires reporting the numerical values for $D$, $D'$, and $r^2$ rounded to four significant figures.\n- $D = 0.1640$\n- $D' \\approx 0.7321$\n- $r^2 \\approx 0.4548$\n\nAccording to the provided classification rule, since $r^2 \\approx 0.4548$ falls within the range $0.2 \\le r^2  0.8$, the linkage disequilibrium between these two loci is classified as moderate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1640  0.7321  0.4548\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2831172"}, {"introduction": "While the coefficient $D$ measures the absolute deviation from independent assortment, its value is constrained by allele frequencies.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution will be executed in three parts as required by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we construct the haplotype frequency tables. The calculations have been performed during validation.

We define two indicator random variables. Let $X_A$ be a variable that takes the value $1$ if a chromosome carries allele $A$, and $0$ if it carries allele $a$. Similarly, let $X_B$ be a variable that takes the value $1$ for allele $B$ and $0$ for allele $b$.\nThe probabilities are $P(X_A=1) = p_A$ and $P(X_A=0) = p_a$.\nThese are Bernoulli random variables. The expectation of $X_A$ is $E[X_A] = (1)P(X_A=1) + (0)P(X_A=0) = p_A$.\nThe variance of $X_A$ is $\\text{Var}(X_A) = E[X_A^2] - (E[X_A])^2$. Since $X_A$ is an indicator, $X_A^2 = X_A$, so $E[X_A^2] = E[X_A] = p_A$.\nThus, $\\text{Var}(X_A) = p_A - p_A^2 = p_A(1-p_A) = p_A p_a$.\nBy identical logic, for the variable $X_B$, we have $E[X_B] = p_B$ and $\\text{Var}(X_B) = p_B p_b$.\n\nThe squared correlation coefficient $r^2$ is defined as:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{(\\text{Cov}(X_A, X_B))^2}{\\text{Var}(X_A) \\text{Var}(X_B)}$$\nThe covariance is $\\text{Cov}(X_A, X_B) = E[X_A X_B] - E[X_A]E[X_B]$.\nThe product $X_A X_B$ equals $1$ only when both $X_A=1$ and $X_B=1$, which corresponds to the occurrence of the $AB$ haplotype. The probability of this joint event is $p_{AB}$. In all other cases, $X_A X_B = 0$.\nTherefore, $E[X_A X_B] = (1)P(X_A=1, X_B=1) = p_{AB}$.\nSubstituting this into the covariance formula yields:\n$$\\text{Cov}(X_A, X_B) = p_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nThis is precisely the definition of the linkage disequilibrium coefficient $D$.\nSubstituting the expressions for covariance and variances into the formula for $r^2$, we obtain the general expression:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b}$$\nNow, we compute $r^2$ for each dataset.\nFor Dataset $X$:\n$$r_X^2 = \\frac{(0.02)^2}{p_{A}^{(X)} p_{a}^{(X)} p_{B}^{(X)} p_{b}^{(X)}} = \\frac{(0.02)^2}{(0.70)(0.30)(0.60)(0.40)} = \\frac{0.0004}{0.0504}$$\n$$r_X^2 = \\frac{4}{504} = \\frac{1}{126}$$\nFor Dataset $Y$:\n$$r_Y^2 = \\frac{(0.02)^2}{p_{A}^{(Y)} p_{a}^{(Y)} p_{B}^{(Y)} p_{b}^{(Y)}} = \\frac{(0.02)^2}{(0.95)(0.05)(0.95)(0.05)} = \\frac{0.0004}{(0.0475)^2} = \\frac{0.0004}{0.00225625}$$\n$$r_Y^2 = \\frac{40000}{225625} = \\frac{64}{361}$$\n\nThird, we compute the ratio $R = r_Y^2 / r_X^2$.\n$$R = \\frac{r_Y^2}{r_X^2} = \\frac{D^2 / (p_{A}^{(Y)} p_{a}^{(Y)} p_{B}^{(Y)} p_{b}^{(Y)})}{D^2 / (p_{A}^{(X)} p_{a}^{(X)} p_{B}^{(X)} p_{b}^{(X)})} = \\frac{p_{A}^{(X)} p_{a}^{(X)} p_{B}^{(X)} p_{b}^{(X)}}{p_{A}^{(Y)} p_{a}^{(Y)} p_{B}^{(Y)} p_{b}^{(Y)}}$$\n$$R = \\frac{0.0504}{0.00225625}$$\nThis calculation yields:\n$$R = 22.33795015 \\ldots$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 22.34$$\nThis demonstrates that for a constant value of $D$, the squared correlation $r^2$ is highly sensitive to allele frequencies, becoming much larger when allele frequencies are skewed toward $0$ or $1$.
