This foundational exercise guides you through deriving the expected frequencies of testcross progeny directly from the definition of the recombination fraction, $r$.

Consider a single meiosis in a doubly heterozygous parent that can be in either coupling phase $AB/ab$ or repulsion phase $Ab/aB$, testcrossed to a homozygous recessive $ab/ab$ tester. Assume the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- The recombination fraction $r \\in [0, \\tfrac{1}{2}]$ between loci $A$ and $B$ is defined as the probability that a haploid product (gamete) produced by the doubly heterozygous parent carries a recombinant haplotype across the two loci.\n- In the absence of viability selection, each zygote class formed in the testcross directly reports the haplotype contributed by the doubly heterozygous parent.\n- In a single meiosis with no chromatid interference and no segregation distortion, symmetry implies that, conditional on recombination occurring between the two loci, the two possible recombinant chromatids occur with equal probability, and conditional on no recombination, the two nonrecombinant (parental) chromatids occur with equal probability.\n\nStarting strictly from these definitions, and without invoking any shortcut formulas, do the following:\n1.

It presents a standard model from classical transmission genetics. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to derive the expected frequencies of progeny from a testcross involving a doubly heterozygous individual, starting from foundational definitions. Let the two loci be $A$ and $B$, with alleles $(A, a)$ and $(B, b)$ respectively. The doubly heterozygous parent is crossed with a homozygous recessive tester of genotype $ab/ab$. The tester produces only one type of gamete, carrying the haplotype $ab$. Consequently, the genotype of any progeny uniquely determines the haplotype contributed by the heterozygous parent, as per the no-viability-selection assumption.\n\nFirst, we identify the nonrecombinant and recombinant progeny classes for each parental phase. The phase refers to the arrangement of alleles on the homologous chromosomes of the doubly heterozygous parent.\n\n1.  **Coupling Phase ($AB/ab$):**\n    The parental haplotypes, which are present on the chromosomes of the parent, are $AB$ and $ab$. A meiotic event without crossing over between the loci produces gametes with these parental haplotypes. These are the nonrecombinant gametes. A meiotic event with a single crossover (or any odd number of crossovers) between the loci results in the exchange of genetic material, producing recombinant haplotypes $Ab$ and $aB$.\n    Therefore, for a parent of genotype $AB/ab$:\n    -   Nonrecombinant gametes carry haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$. The corresponding testcross progeny have genotypes $AB/ab$ and $ab/ab$.\n    -   Recombinant gametes carry haplotypes $Ab$ and $aB$. The corresponding testcross progeny have genotypes $Ab/ab$ and $aB/ab$.\n\n2.  **Repulsion Phase ($Ab/aB$):**\n    The parental haplotypes are $Ab$ and $aB$. Meiotic products without recombination between the loci will carry these haplotypes. A crossover event between the loci will produce the recombinant haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$.\n    Therefore, for a parent of genotype $Ab/aB$:\n    -   Nonrecombinant gametes carry haplotypes $Ab$ and $aB$. The corresponding testcross progeny have genotypes $Ab/ab$ and $aB/ab$.\n    -   Recombinant gametes carry haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$. The corresponding testcross progeny have genotypes $AB/ab$ and $ab/ab$.\n\nThis completes the first part of the problem. Now, we derive the expected frequencies as a function of the recombination fraction, $r$.\n\nThe recombination fraction $r$ is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen gamete from the heterozygous parent is of a recombinant type. Let $\\mathcal{R}$ denote the event that a gamete is recombinant, and $\\mathcal{NR}$ be the event that it is nonrecombinant. By definition, $P(\\mathcal{R}) = r$. Since these are the only two possibilities, the total probability must be $1$.\n$$ P(\\mathcal{R}) + P(\\mathcal{NR}) = 1 $$\nFrom this, the probability of producing a nonrecombinant gamete is $P(\\mathcal{NR}) = 1 - r$. These are the total frequencies for the two categories, recombinant and nonrecombinant.\n\nNext, we must find the frequencies of the individual gamete types. The problem states a symmetry condition: conditional on an event being recombinant, the two possible recombinant gamete types are produced with equal probability. Similarly, conditional on an event being nonrecombinant, the two parental gamete types are produced with equal probability.\n\nLet the four possible gamete haplotypes produced by the heterozygous parent be $H_1$, $H_2$, $H_3$, and $H_4$. Regardless of phase, two are nonrecombinant (parental) and two are recombinant. Let $H_{NR1}$ and $H_{NR2}$ be the two nonrecombinant haplotypes, and let $H_{R1}$ and $H_{R2}$ be the two recombinant haplotypes.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the frequency of a specific nonrecombinant gamete, say $H_{NR1}$, is:\n$$ P(H_{NR1}) = P(H_{NR1} | \\mathcal{NR}) \\times P(\\mathcal{NR}) $$\nAccording to the symmetry principle, $P(H_{NR1} | \\mathcal{NR}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. We have already established that $P(\\mathcal{NR}) = 1 - r$. Therefore,\n$$ P(H_{NR1}) = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - r) = \\frac{1-r}{2} $$\nBy the same logic, the frequency of the other nonrecombinant gamete $H_{NR2}$ is also $\\frac{1-r}{2}$. The sum of their frequencies is $(\\frac{1-r}{2}) + (\\frac{1-r}{2}) = 1-r$, which is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, the frequency of a specific recombinant gamete, say $H_{R1}$, is:\n$$ P(H_{R1}) = P(H_{R1} | \\mathcal{R}) \\times P(\\mathcal{R}) $$\nAccording to the symmetry principle, $P(H_{R1} | \\mathcal{R}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. By definition, $P(\\mathcal{R}) = r$. Therefore,\n$$ P(H_{R1}) = \\frac{1}{2} r = \\frac{r}{2} $$\nThe frequency of the other recombinant gamete $H_{R2}$ is also $\\frac{r}{2}$. The sum of their frequencies is $(\\frac{r}{2}) + (\\frac{r}{2}) = r$, which is consistent.\n\nThis completes the second part of the problem. Now, for the final part, we apply these results to the coupling phase parent ($AB/ab$).\n-   The nonrecombinant haplotypes are $AB$ and $ab$. Their expected frequencies are each $\\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n-   The recombinant haplotypes are $Ab$ and $aB$. Their expected frequencies are each $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n\nSince progeny genotypes from a testcross directly reflect the gamete frequencies of the heterozygous parent, we have:\n-   Frequency of progeny $AB/ab$ = Frequency of gamete $AB$ = $\\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n-   Frequency of progeny $Ab/ab$ = Frequency of gamete $Ab$ = $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n-   Frequency of progeny $aB/ab$ = Frequency of gamete $aB$ = $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n-   Frequency of progeny $ab/ab$ = Frequency of gamete $ab$ = $\\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n\nThe problem requires a single row vector of six entries.\n1.  Total frequency of nonrecombinants: This is $P(\\mathcal{NR}) = 1-r$.\n2.  Total frequency of recombinants: This is $P(\\mathcal{R}) = r$.\n3.  Frequency of $AB/ab$ (coupling): $\\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n4.  Frequency of $Ab/ab$ (coupling): $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n5.  Frequency of $aB/ab$ (coupling): $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n6.  Frequency of $ab/ab$ (coupling): $\\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n\nThe final vector is constructed from these six values in the specified order.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1-r  r  \\frac{1-r}{2}  \\frac{r}{2}  \\frac{r}{2}  \\frac{1-r}{2} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2803902"}, {"introduction": "With the theoretical model established, we can now apply it to a classic experimental design: the three-point testcross.

The meiosis occurs in females only, and there is no crossing over in males. Meiosis is assumed to follow standard behavior with no chromatid interference. The experiment produces $N=1200$ scored offspring, partitioned into the eight reciprocal phenotypic classes as follows (each class count refers to the total across both sexes of progeny, which reflect the maternal gametes directly due to the testcross design):\n\n- Parental (nonrecombinant) classes: $ABC=483$, $abc=483$.\n- Single crossover in the $A$–$B$ interval: $Abc=57$, $aBC=57$.\n- Single crossover in the $B$–$C$ interval: $ABc=57$, $abC=57$.\n- Double crossovers: $AbC=3$, $aBc=3$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of recombination fraction as the proportion of progeny reflecting recombination within an interval and the probability rule that, under the assumption of independence of events, the joint probability equals the product of the marginal probabilities, proceed as follows:\n\n1.

We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for the determination of linkage parameters from a three-point testcross involving three autosomal loci, $A$, $B$, and $C$, with a known gene order of $A$–$B$–$C$. A female of genotype $\\frac{ABC}{abc}$ (heterozygous in coupling phase) is crossed with a triple-recessive male $\\frac{abc}{abc}$. The total number of scored progeny is $N=1200$.

Total NCO count is $N_{NCO} = 483 + 483 = 966$.\n- Single Crossover (SCO) in region $A$–$B$: $Abc$ ($57$) and $aBC$ ($57$). Total SCO count for this region is $N_{SCO, A-B} = 57 + 57 = 114$.\n- Single Crossover (SCO) in region $B$–$C$: $ABc$ ($57$) and $abC$ ($57$). Total SCO count for this region is $N_{SCO, B-C} = 57 + 57 = 114$.\n- Double Crossover (DCO): $AbC$ ($3$) and $aBc$ ($3$). Total DCO count is $N_{DCO} = 3 + 3 = 6$.\nThe sum of all progeny is $966 + 114 + 114 + 6 = 1200$, which matches the given total $N$.\n\n1. Computation of recombination fractions $r_{AB}$ and $r_{BC}$.\nThe recombination fraction between two loci is the proportion of progeny that have resulted from a crossover event between them. A crossover event is physically a chiasma. For a given interval, recombinant chromosomes are found in both the single crossover and double crossover classes.\n\nFor the interval $A$–$B$, the recombinant progeny are those in the $N_{SCO, A-B}$ and $N_{DCO}$ classes. The total number of recombinant progeny for this interval is $N_{Rec, A-B} = N_{SCO, A-B} + N_{DCO} = 114 + 6 = 120$.\nThe recombination fraction, $r_{AB}$, is defined as:\n$$r_{AB} = \\frac{\\text{Number of recombinant progeny in interval } A\\text{–}B}{\\text{Total number of progeny}} = \\frac{N_{Rec, A-B}}{N}$$\n$$r_{AB} = \\frac{120}{1200} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\nFor the interval $B$–$C$, the recombinant progeny are those in the $N_{SCO, B-C}$ and $N_{DCO}$ classes. The total number of recombinant progeny for this interval is $N_{Rec, B-C} = N_{SCO, B-C} + N_{DCO} = 114 + 6 = 120$.\nThe recombination fraction, $r_{BC}$, is defined as:\n$$r_{BC} = \\frac{\\text{Number of recombinant progeny in interval } B\\text{–}C}{\\text{Total number of progeny}} = \\frac{N_{Rec, B-C}}{N}$$\n$$r_{BC} = \\frac{120}{1200} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\n2. Derivation of the expected number of double crossovers ($E$).\nUnder the assumption of no crossover interference, the occurrence of a crossover in one interval is statistically independent of the occurrence of a crossover in an adjacent interval. Therefore, the probability of a double crossover, $P(DCO)$, is the product of the probabilities of a crossover in each interval. These probabilities are the recombination fractions $r_{AB}$ and $r_{BC}$.\n$$P(DCO)_{\\text{expected}} = r_{AB} \\times r_{BC}$$\n$$P(DCO)_{\\text{expected}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{100}$$\nThe expected number of double crossover progeny, $E$, is this probability multiplied by the total number of progeny, $N$.\n$$E = P(DCO)_{\\text{expected}} \\times N = \\frac{1}{100} \\times 1200 = 12$$\n\n3. Determination of the observed number of double crossovers ($O$).\nThe observed number of double crossovers, $O$, is the sum of the counts of the two double crossover phenotypic classes, $AbC$ and $aBc$.\n$$O = N_{DCO} = 3 + 3 = 6$$\n\n4. Computation of the coefficient of coincidence (CoC).\nThe coefficient of coincidence is defined as the ratio of the observed frequency (or number) of double crossovers to the expected frequency (or number) of double crossovers.\n$$\\mathrm{CoC} = \\frac{\\text{Observed number of DCO}}{\\text{Expected number of DCO}} = \\frac{O}{E}$$\n$$\\mathrm{CoC} = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n5. Computation of interference ($I$).\nInterference, $I$, quantifies the degree to which one crossover event influences the probability of another occurring nearby. It is defined as the complement of the coefficient of coincidence.\n$$I = 1 - \\mathrm{CoC}$$\n$$I = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n6. Interpretation of interference ($I$).\nThe calculated value of interference is $I = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $0.5$.\n- The sign of $I$ is positive. This indicates positive interference, which is the typical situation in the meiosis of most eukaryotic organisms. It means that the formation of a chiasma at one location along a chromosome reduces the likelihood of a second chiasma forming in a nearby region.\n- The magnitude, $I = 0.5$, signifies that $50\\%$ of the expected double crossovers did not occur. In other words, the presence of a crossover in the $A$–$B$ interval inhibited the formation of a crossover in the adjacent $B$–$C$ interval by $50\\%$ (and vice-versa). If there were no interference ($I=0$), we would have observed $12$ double crossovers. If interference were complete ($I=1$), we would have observed zero double crossovers. The observed value of $6$ is exactly halfway between these two extremes, consistent with $I=0.5$. This non-random spacing of crossovers is a biologically significant mechanism thought to be involved in ensuring the proper disjunction of homologous chromosomes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2803931"}, {"introduction": "Genetic experiments, like all scientific measurements, are subject to sampling error, a reality that demands careful statistical interpretation.

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\nThe dihybrid parent with genotype $AB/ab$ produces four types of gametes. Let $r$ be the recombination frequency.\n- The total probability of producing a nonrecombinant gamete ($AB$ or $ab$) is $1-r$. By Mendel's law of segregation, these two gamete types are expected in equal frequencies, so $P(AB) = P(ab) = (1-r)/2$.\n- The total probability of producing a recombinant gamete ($Ab$ or $aB$) is $r$. Similarly, these are expected in equal frequencies, so $P(Ab) = P(aB) = r/2$.\nIn a testcross with an $ab/ab$ parent, the phenotype of the progeny directly reveals the gamete contributed by the dihybrid parent. The probability that a single progeny is recombinant is $P(Ab) + P(aB) = r/2 + r/2 = r$. The probability that it is nonrecombinant is $1-r$.\n\nLet $R$ be the number of recombinant progeny in a sample of size $N$. Each of the $N$ progeny is an independent trial, so $R$ follows a binomial distribution, $R \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, r)$. The probability of observing $k$ recombinants is given by:\n$$P(R=k | N, r) = \\binom{N}{k} r^k (1-r)^{N-k}$$\nIn this experiment, $N=20$ and the observed number of recombinants is $R = (\\text{count of } Ab) + (\\text{count of } aB) = 0+0=0$.\n\nThe junior colleague's conclusion is that $r=0$. This corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $r$. The likelihood function for $r$ given the data $R=0$ is:\n$$L(r | R=0) = \\binom{20}{0} r^0 (1-r)^{20} = (1-r)^{20}$$\nThis function is maximized for $r \\in [0, 0.5]$ when $r$ is minimized, i.e., at $\\hat{r} = 0$. However, concluding that the true parameter $r$ is exactly $0$ based on a point estimate from a small sample is statistically naive. It completely ignores sampling error. A small but positive value of $r$ could easily yield $R=0$ in a sample of only $N=20$ by chance. For example, if the true $r=0.05$ (corresponding to $5$ centimorgans), the probability of observing no recombinants is $P(R=0 | N=20, r=0.05) = (1-0.05)^{20} = (0.95)^{20} \\approx 0.358$. This probability is not negligible, so we cannot rule out $r=0.05$.\n\nA statistically sound approach is to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate of $r$ by constructing a confidence interval. A $95\\%$ confidence interval gives a range of values for $r$ that are consistent with the observed data. For an observation of $R=0$ recombinants in $N$ trials, the exact one-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval is $[0, r_{\\text{upper}}]$, where $r_{\\text{upper}}$ is the value of $r$ for which the probability of observing a result as or more extreme than $R=0$ is $\\alpha=0.05$. The only result as or more extreme than $R=0$ is $R=0$ itself. Thus, we solve for $r_{\\text{upper}}$ in the equation:\n$$P(R=0 | N=20, r=r_{\\text{upper}}) = 0.05$$\n$$(1-r_{\\text{upper}})^{20} = 0.05$$\nSolving for $r_{\\text{upper}}$:\n$$1 - r_{\\text{upper}} = (0.05)^{1/20}$$\n$$r_{\\text{upper}} = 1 - (0.05)^{1/20}$$\nUsing a calculator, $\\ln(0.05) \\approx -2.99573$. Then $(1/20)\\ln(0.05) \\approx -0.149786$. So, $(0.05)^{1/20} = e^{-0.149786} \\approx 0.86089$.\n$$r_{\\text{upper}} \\approx 1 - 0.86089 = 0.13911$$\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for $r$ is approximately $[0, 0.139]$. This means that while the data are consistent with complete linkage ($r=0$), they are also consistent with recombination frequencies as high as $13.9\\%$. Therefore, it is incorrect to declare complete linkage. The proper conclusion is that the loci appear to be linked, but the data are insufficient to provide a precise estimate of $r$, which could plausibly lie anywhere in the interval $[0, 0.139]$.\n\nNow, I evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Because $R=0$ out of $N=20$, the maximum likelihood estimate is $r=0$ and complete linkage is established; no further analysis is necessary since rare recombinants would have appeared with larger $N$ if $r>0$.**\nThis option correctly states that the MLE is $\\hat{r}=0$. However, it incorrectly equates this point estimate with the true parameter value, claiming \"complete linkage is established\" and that \"no further analysis is necessary\". This is a profound statistical error, as it ignores sampling uncertainty, which is very large with $N=20$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The maximum likelihood estimate is $\\hat r=0$, but with $N=20$ the absence of observed recombinants can still occur with non-negligible probability when $r>0$. A principled correction is to report an exact binomial $95\\%$ confidence interval for $r$, whose upper bound solves $(1-r)^{20}=0.05$, yielding $r\\approx 0.139$, and to refrain from claiming complete linkage.**\nThis option correctly identifies the MLE as $\\hat{r}=0$ but immediately points out the flaw in stopping there, acknowledging the role of chance. It proposes the correct statistical procedure: constructing an exact binomial confidence interval. It provides the correct equation for the upper bound of this interval, $(1-r)^{20}=0.05$, calculates the correct value $r \\approx 0.139$, and draws the correct scientific conclusion: one must \"refrain from claiming complete linkage.\" This analysis is entirely sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. A Pearson chi-square goodness-of-fit test against the $1:1:1:1$ four-class expectation is appropriate; since two classes are zero, apply Yates’s continuity correction and accept the null of independent assortment.**\nThis option is flawed in multiple respects. First, the $1:1:1:1$ ratio corresponds to independent assortment ($r=0.5$). The observed data ($10:10:0:0$) are clearly inconsistent with this null hypothesis. A chi-square test confirms this: Observeds are $O=(10, 10, 0, 0)$, Expecteds for $r=0.5$ are $E=(5, 5, 5, 5)$. $\\chi^2 = \\sum (O-E)^2/E = (10-5)^2/5 + (10-5)^2/5 + (0-5)^2/5 + (0-5)^2/5 = 5+5+5+5=20$. With $3$ degrees of freedom, the P-value is extremely small ($P \\approx 0.00017$), leading to a strong rejection, not acceptance, of the null hypothesis. Second, Yates's correction is for tests with $1$ degree of freedom, not $3$. Third, the goal is to estimate $r$, not just test for independent assortment.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. To mitigate small-sample error, require a minimum of $N=200$ before making any inference. Until then, treat the loci as unlinked and set $r=0.5$ to avoid bias from zero cells.**\nThis is an unscientific recommendation. One must analyze the data available; refusing to do so is not a valid scientific practice. Moreover, the suggestion to \"treat the loci as unlinked and set $r=0.5$\" is profoundly wrong. The data provide strong evidence *against* independent assortment. To assume $r=0.5$ would be to introduce a severe bias, not to avoid it.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Apply Laplace smoothing and estimate $\\tilde r=(R+1)/(N+2)=1/22\\approx 0.045$ as the recombination fraction, then conclude a map distance of approximately $4.5$ centimorgans with a non-significant deviation from independent assortment at $P>0.05$.**\nApplying Laplace's rule of succession to get a point estimate of $\\tilde{r} = (0+1)/(20+2) = 1/22 \\approx 0.045$ is a valid Bayesian technique. The corresponding map distance of $4.5$ cM is also a reasonable conversion. However, the final claim that this represents a \"non-significant deviation from independent assortment at $P>0.05$\" is false. As shown in the analysis of option C, the data show a highly significant deviation from independent assortment ($r=0.5$). Therefore, the conclusion of this option is factually wrong.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2803899"}]}
