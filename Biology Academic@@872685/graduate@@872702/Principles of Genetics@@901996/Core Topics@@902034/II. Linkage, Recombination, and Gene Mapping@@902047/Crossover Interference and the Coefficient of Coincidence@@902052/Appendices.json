There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and unambiguously formulated. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet $E_{AB}$ be the event that a randomly selected gamete from the heterozygote parent is recombinant for the interval between loci $A$ and $B$. Let $E_{BC}$ be the event that the same gamete is recombinant for the interval between loci $B$ and $C$.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, the recombination fraction is the probability of a recombination event in a given interval. Therefore, the probabilities of these events are given by the single-interval recombination fractions:\n$$P(E_{AB}) = r_{AB}$$\n$$P(E_{BC}) = r_{BC}$$\n\nA double crossover (DCO) gamete is, by definition, one that is the result of simultaneous recombination events in both the $A$-$B$ interval and the $B$-$C$ interval. In terms of probability theory, a DCO gamete corresponds to the joint occurrence of events $E_{AB}$ and $E_{BC}$. The probability of a DCO, denoted as $P(\\text{DCO})$, is thus the probability of the intersection of these two events:\n$$P(\\text{DCO}) = P(E_{AB} \\cap E_{BC})$$\n\nThe problem explicitly states the critical assumption of **no crossover interference**. This statement has a precise mathematical meaning: the occurrence of a crossover event in one genomic interval has no influence on the probability of a crossover event in an adjacent interval. This means that the events $E_{AB}$ and $E_{BC}$ are statistically independent.\n\nFor two independent events, the probability of their joint occurrence is the product of their individual probabilities. Applying this fundamental axiom of probability theory, we have:\n$$P(E_{AB} \\cap E_{BC}) = P(E_{AB}) \\times P(E_{BC})$$\n\nSubstituting the probabilities with the given recombination fractions, we derive the expression for the expected probability of a DCO gamete:\n$$P(\\text{DCO}) = r_{AB} \\times r_{BC}$$\nThis is the desired expression from first principles for the expected probability of a double crossover gamete under the assumption of no interference.\n\nThe problem also mentions that the coefficient of coincidence ($C.O.C.$) is equal to $1$. This is merely a restatement of the no-interference assumption. The coefficient of coincidence is formally defined as the ratio of the observed DCO frequency to the expected DCO frequency under the hypothesis of independence:\n$$C.O.C. = \\frac{\\text{Observed DCO frequency}}{\\text{Expected DCO frequency}} = \\frac{P(E_{AB} \\cap E_{BC})}{P(E_{AB}) \\times P(E_{BC})}$$\nSetting $C.O.C. = 1$ directly enforces the condition $P(E_{AB} \\cap E_{BC}) = P(E_{AB}) \\times P(E_{BC})$, confirming our use of the independence rule.\n\nThe problem requires the expected number of DCO progeny, which we denote as $E[N_{\\text{DCO}}]$, from a total of $n$ progeny. Since each of the $n$ progeny results from a randomly drawn gamete, and these draws are independent trials, the number of DCO progeny follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (number of trials) and $p = P(\\text{DCO})$ (probability of success on each trial).\n\nThe expected value of a binomial distribution $B(n, p)$ is given by the product $np$. Therefore, the expected number of DCO progeny is:\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = n \\times P(\\text{DCO})$$\n\nSubstituting our derived expression for $P(\\text{DCO})$, we obtain the final expression for the expected number of DCO progeny as a function of $n$, $r_{AB}$, and $r_{BC}$:\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = n \\times r_{AB} \\times r_{BC}$$\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $n = 20{,}000$, $r_{AB} = 0.12$, and $r_{BC} = 0.08$.\n\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 20{,}000 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.08$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 20{,}000 \\times 0.0096$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = (2 \\times 10^4) \\times (9.6 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 2 \\times 9.6 \\times 10^{(4-3)}$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 19.2 \\times 10^1$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 192$$\n\nThe expected number of double crossover progeny is exactly $192$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{192}$$", "id": "2802714"}, {"introduction": "In practice, crossover events are rarely independent; the occurrence of one crossover typically influences the probability of another nearby, a phenomenon known as interference.

The total number of progeny is $N=10000$.\n\nThe recombination fraction between two markers is the sum of all crossover events occurring between them, divided by the total number of progeny.\n\nFor interval A–B, the recombinants are the single crossovers in A–B and the double crossovers.\n$$r_{AB} = \\frac{\\text{Number of SCO A-B} + \\text{Number of DCO}}{N} = \\frac{800 + 100}{10000} = \\frac{900}{10000} = 0.09$$\n\nFor interval B–C, the recombinants are the single crossovers in B–C and the double crossovers.\n$$r_{BC} = \\frac{\\text{Number of SCO B-C} + \\text{Number of DCO}}{N} = \\frac{1200 + 100}{10000} = \\frac{1300}{10000} = 0.13$$\n\nThe observed frequency of double crossovers is:\n$$f(DCO)_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of DCO}}{N} = \\frac{100}{10000} = 0.01$$\n\nThe expected frequency of double crossovers, assuming independence of crossover events in the two intervals, is the product of the individual recombination fractions:\n$$f(DCO)_{\\text{exp}} = r_{AB} \\times r_{BC} = 0.09 \\times 0.13 = 0.0117$$\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence ($c$) is the ratio of the observed to expected double crossover frequencies:\n$$c = \\frac{f(DCO)_{\\text{obs}}}{f(DCO)_{\\text{exp}}} = \\frac{0.01}{0.0117} \\approx 0.8547$$\n\nInterference ($I$) is then calculated as:\n$$I = 1 - c = 1 - 0.8547 = 0.1453$$\n\nNow, consider a two-point mapping experiment between markers A and C, where marker B is not scored. A progeny is recombinant for A and C if its alleles for these two markers differ from the parental configuration. In a testcross with parental chromosomes `A B C` and `a b c`, the parental gametes are `ABC` and `abc`.\n- SCO in A–B produces gametes `aBC` and `Abc`. The outer markers `aC` and `Ac` are recombinant.\n- SCO in B–C produces gametes `ABc` and `abC`. The outer markers `Ac` and `aC` are recombinant.\n- DCO produces gametes `AbC` and `aBc`. The outer markers `AC` and `ac` have the parental configuration.\nTherefore, DCOs are not detected as recombinants in a two-point cross between the outer markers.\n\nThe number of recombinants observed between A and C would be the sum of single crossovers in each interval:\n$$\\text{Number of A-C recombinants} = \\text{Number of SCO A-B} + \\text{Number of SCO B-C} = 800 + 1200 = 2000$$\n\nThe reported two-point recombination fraction, $r_{AC,\\text{reported}}$, would be:\n$$r_{AC,\\text{reported}} = \\frac{2000}{10000} = 0.20$$\n\nWith these quantities calculated, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A.

A recombination fraction $r$ is an estimate of map distance $m$ (in Morgans), but they are not equal, related by a mapping function (e.g., Haldane's or Kosambi's). For any non-infinitesimal interval, $r  m$ because of undetected multiple crossovers *within* that interval. The statement's claim that this equality holds \"for intervals of any size\" is fundamentally false. For example, if $m_{AB}$ were $30$ cM, $r_{AB}$ would be significantly less than $0.3$. Additivity applies to map distances ($m_{AC} = m_{AB} + m_{BC}$ by definition), not recombination fractions. The statement incorrectly equates a recombination fraction with a sum of map distances.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.

This is the correct mechanistic reason why DCOs are counted as parental (non-recombinant) types in a two-point cross involving only the outer markers.\nThe consequence described is that the reported two-point recombination fraction $r_{AC,\\text{reported}}$ will be less than the sum of the recombination fractions of the constituent intervals, $r_{AB} + r_{BC}$, when DCOs are present. As shown in the analysis for option A, $r_{AC,\\text{reported}} = (r_{AB} + r_{BC}) - 2 \\times f(DCO)_{\\text{obs}}$. If $f(DCO)_{\\text{obs}}  0$, then $r_{AC,\\text{reported}}  r_{AB} + r_{BC}$. The term \"cumulative recombination across A-B and B-C\" is reasonably interpreted in this context as $r_{AB} + r_{BC}$. Thus, the two-point estimate systematically underestimates this sum.

This is correct.\n\nThe fitted model for the coefficient of coincidence is:\n$$\n\\phi(d) = 1 - \\exp(-50 d^2)\n$$\nThe final task is to compute the predicted CoC at a map distance of $d^{\\star} = 0.08$ Morgans.\nWe substitute $d = 0.08$ into our derived model:\n$$\n\\phi(0.08) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-50 \\times (0.08)^2\\right)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n$$\n-50 \\times (0.08)^2 = -50 \\times 0.0064 = -0.32\n$$\nSo, the CoC is:\n$$\n\\phi(0.08) = 1 - \\exp(-0.32)\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(-0.32) \\approx 0.726149037\n$$\n$$\n\\phi(0.08) \\approx 1 - 0.726149037 = 0.273850963\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\n\\phi(0.08) \\approx 0.2739\n$$\nThis is the model-predicted coefficient of coincidence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2739}$$", "id": "2802688"}]}
