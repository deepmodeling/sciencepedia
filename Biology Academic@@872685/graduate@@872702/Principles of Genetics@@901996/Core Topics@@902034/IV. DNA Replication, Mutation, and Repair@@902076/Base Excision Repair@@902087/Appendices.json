{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway is a precise, multi-step process akin to a molecular assembly line. To truly understand this pathway, it is essential to appreciate the specific role of each enzymatic \"worker.\" This first practice problem uses a thought experiment involving a genetic knockout to isolate and examine a critical step: the processing of an abasic site by the AP endonuclease, APE1. By predicting the outcome in a cell where this enzyme is non-functional, you can solidify your understanding of the pathway's sequential nature and the consequences of its interruption [@problem_id:2305512].", "problem": "Base Excision Repair (BER) is a critical cellular mechanism for correcting single-base DNA damage. The process is initiated by a DNA glycosylase, which recognizes and removes the damaged or incorrect base by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond, leaving behind an apurinic/apyrimidinic site, commonly known as an abasic (AP) site. The next step is carried out by an enzyme called AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1), which nicks the phosphodiester backbone immediately 5' to the AP site, creating a single-strand break that is a substrate for subsequent repair enzymes.\n\nConsider a human cell line that has a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding for APE1, rendering the protein completely non-functional. However, all other DNA repair proteins, including various DNA glycosylases, are fully functional. A C:G base pair in the DNA of one of these cells undergoes spontaneous deamination, converting the cytosine base to a uracil base.\n\nWhat will be the most likely state of the DNA at this specific site after the cell's BER machinery has had an opportunity to act?\n\nA. The DNA will contain a uracil base paired with a guanine base, as the repair pathway cannot be initiated.\n\nB. The DNA will have a single-strand break (a nick) in the phosphodiester backbone, and the abasic site will have been removed.\n\nC. The DNA will contain an abasic site where the uracil was, and the phosphodiester backbone will be intact at that location.\n\nD. The DNA strand will be fully repaired, with a normal cytosine base correctly paired with the guanine.\n\nE. The DNA will suffer a double-strand break at the site of the damage.", "solution": "1) Spontaneous deamination converts a cytosine in a C:G pair to uracil, producing a U:G mispair.\n\n2) BER initiation is performed by a DNA glycosylase specific for uracil (e.g., uracil DNA glycosylase). This enzyme recognizes the U:G mispair and cleaves the N-glycosidic bond of uracil, removing the base and leaving an abasic (AP) site. As a monofunctional glycosylase, it does not incise the phosphodiester backbone.\n\n3) In normal BER, the next step requires AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) to incise the DNA backbone immediately 5' to the AP site, generating a single-strand nick with a 3'-OH and a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate. This incision is essential to allow polymerase and ligase to complete repair.\n\n4) In the given cell, APE1 is completely non-functional. Therefore, the AP site generated by the glycosylase cannot be incised. No nick is formed, and downstream steps (gap filling and ligation) cannot proceed.\n\n5) Consequently, the most likely state of the lesion after the BER machinery acts is an intact phosphodiester backbone containing an unrepaired AP site at the position formerly occupied by uracil.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is that the DNA contains an abasic site with an intact backbone at that location.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2305512"}, {"introduction": "Having explored an intermediate stage of BER, we now turn our attention to the final act of repair: sealing the DNA backbone. After the damaged base is removed, the backbone is nicked, and a new nucleotide is inserted, the integrity of the DNA strand must be fully restored. This exercise simulates the effect of a specific inhibitor that blocks DNA ligase, the enzyme responsible for this final sealing step. This scenario allows you to distinguish between a repaired nucleotide gap and an unsealed phosphodiester \"nick,\" clarifying the crucial role of ligation in completing the BER process [@problem_id:1471606].", "problem": "In a molecular biology experiment, a culture of human cells is being studied for its response to DNA damage. These cells are exposed to an agent that causes deamination of cytosine to uracil, a common form of DNA damage repaired by the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway. Subsequently, the cells are treated with a highly specific and potent inhibitor that completely blocks the activity of all DNA ligase enzymes. Assume that for a specific uracil lesion, the BER pathway is initiated, and all enzymatic steps prior to the ligation step—namely the actions of DNA glycosylase, AP endonuclease, and DNA polymerase—proceed to completion without any issues.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the final state of the DNA molecule at this specific site of repair?\n\nA. An abasic site is present where the uracil was removed, but the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA strand remains covalently intact.\n\nB. A double-strand break has been created at the location of the original DNA damage.\n\nC. The DNA molecule is completely restored to its original, error-free double-helical structure.\n\nD. A single-strand break, also known as a nick, persists in the DNA backbone next to the newly inserted nucleotide.\n\nE. The damaged base and a segment of the sugar-phosphate backbone have been removed, leaving a one-nucleotide gap in the DNA strand.", "solution": "The lesion is deamination of cytosine to uracil, which is processed by the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway. The relevant mechanistic steps are as follows.\n\n1) DNA glycosylase (uracil DNA glycosylase) recognizes uracil in DNA and hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic bond, removing the uracil base and creating an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP, abasic) site. At this point, the phosphodiester backbone remains intact.\n\n2) AP endonuclease incises the DNA backbone on the 5' side of the AP site, generating a single-strand break with a 3'-hydroxyl and a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (5'-dRP) terminus.\n\n3) DNA polymerase (e.g., polymerase beta in short-patch BER) processes the 5'-dRP moiety (via its dRP lyase activity) and inserts the correct nucleotide to replace the uracil. In long-patch BER, the polymerase displaces a short flap that is removed by FEN1, but in both short- and long-patch BER, after polymerase action the missing base(s) have been replaced and there is no nucleotide gap remaining.\n\n4) The final step of BER requires a DNA ligase (ligase III with XRCC1 in short-patch BER or ligase I in long-patch BER) to seal the remaining nick by forming the final phosphodiester bond between the 3'-hydroxyl of the newly inserted nucleotide and the downstream 5'-phosphate.\n\nGiven that all DNA ligase activity is completely inhibited, steps through polymerase completion occur, but the ligation step cannot proceed. Therefore, at the repair site the DNA contains a single-strand break (nick) adjacent to the newly inserted nucleotide. It is not an abasic site (because the base has been replaced), not a double-strand break (only one strand was incised), not fully restored (the nick is unsealed), and not a one-nucleotide gap (the nucleotide has been inserted; only the phosphodiester bond is missing).\n\nThus, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1471606"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercises examined what happens when the BER pathway is blocked, this practice delves into the quantitative fidelity of the process itself.

By calculating how an imbalanced pool of nucleotide precursors affects the rate of correct versus incorrect base insertion, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how cellular metabolism and DNA repair are intricately linked, and how the repair process itself can sometimes become a source of mutations [@problem_id:2305492].", "problem": "During Base Excision Repair (BER), a damaged base is removed and replaced.
