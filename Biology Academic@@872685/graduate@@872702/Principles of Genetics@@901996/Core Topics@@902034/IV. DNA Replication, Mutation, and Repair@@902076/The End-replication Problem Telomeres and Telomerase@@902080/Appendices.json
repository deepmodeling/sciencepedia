These somatic cells are observed to have a diploid chromosome number of 38. In culture, the cells divide synchronously. The initial average length of a telomere in this cell line is measured to be 12.0 kilobase pairs (kbp). Due to the end-replication problem, these cells lack significant telomerase activity, and it is determined that each telomere shortens by an average of 65 base pairs (bp) with each round of cell division. The cells are programmed to enter a state of irreversible growth arrest, known as cellular senescence, when the average telomere length drops below a critical threshold of 4.8 kbp.\n\nCalculate the total number of base pairs lost from all telomeres in the entire genome of a single cell lineage, from its initial state up to and including the division that causes it to enter senescence.

The human telomeric repeat sequence is `5'-TTAGGG-3'`. The investigator performs an *in vitro* telomerase activity assay using a short, single-stranded DNA primer with the sequence `5'-(TTAGGG)2-3'`, which is a 12-nucleotide primer.\n\nThe reaction mixture contains the primer, purified telomerase enzyme (either wild-type or a mutant form), and all four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). To visualize the products, the dGTP in the mixture is radioactively labeled ([α-³²P]dGTP). After incubation for a fixed period, the reaction products are separated by size using denaturing Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography.\n\nThe experiment with wild-type telomerase produces a characteristic ladder of radioactive bands on the gel. The lowest visible band corresponds to a product of 18 nucleotides, the next band is at 24 nucleotides, the next at 30 nucleotides, and so on, with the intensity of the bands gradually decreasing as the product length increases.\n\nThe investigator then repeats the experiment under identical conditions but uses a purified mutant form of telomerase, \"Mutant X\". The resulting autoradiograph for Mutant X shows a single, prominent radioactive band corresponding to a product size of 18 nucleotides. All other longer products (24-nt, 30-nt, etc.) are either absent or present at vanishingly low levels compared to the 18-nucleotide product. The unreacted 12-nucleotide primer is not visible as it does not incorporate any radioactive label.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following molecular defects most likely explains the behavior of Mutant X?\n\nA. A mutation in the telomerase RNA component that changes the template sequence from `3'-AUC-5'` to `3'-AUU-5'`.\n\nB. A mutation that significantly reduces the catalytic rate (k_cat) of the reverse transcriptase activity but does not affect substrate binding or processivity.\n\nC. A mutation that severely impairs the ability of the enzyme to translocate along the DNA product after successfully synthesizing a single repeat.\n\nD. A mutation that completely prevents the initial binding of the DNA primer to the telomerase active site.\n\nE. A mutation that decreases the Michaelis constant ($K_M$) for the dNTP substrates, making nucleotide incorporation more efficient.", "solution": "- Telomerase extends chromosome ends by adding the hexamer repeat 5'-TTAGGG-3' to the 3' end of DNA using its internal RNA template. After synthesizing one 6-nucleotide repeat, the enzyme must translocate (reposition the RNA template relative to the newly extended DNA 3' end) to add another repeat. The capacity to add multiple repeats without dissociating is termed repeat addition processivity.\n\n- In the assay, only incorporated guanosines are radiolabeled because the mixture contains $[\\alpha\\text{-}{}^{32}\\mathrm{P}]\\mathrm{dGTP}$. Each TTAGGG repeat contains three G residues, so each added repeat introduces label, enabling visualization of products that have undergone extension.\n\n- The primer is 5'-(TTAGGG)2-3' with length $12$ nucleotides. After one repeat addition ($+6$ nt), the product length is $12+6=18$ nt; after two repeats, $24$ nt; after three, $30$ nt, etc. Wild-type telomerase yields a ladder at $18, 24, 30, \\ldots$ nt, indicating repeated cycles of synthesis and translocation (high repeat addition processivity).\n\n- Mutant X yields a single prominent band at $18$ nt with negligible $24$ nt, $30$ nt, etc. This pattern means the enzyme can bind the primer and catalyze synthesis of exactly one TTAGGG repeat (hence strong $18$-nt product with incorporated G), but fails to continue adding further repeats. The specific mechanistic step required after the first repeat is translocation/re-alignment of the product-primer with the RNA template; thus the defect is a severe impairment in translocation (loss of repeat addition processivity) after one repeat.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  - A: Altering the RNA template from 3'-AUC-5' to 3'-AUU-5' would change the sequence and the number of G incorporations per repeat, altering labeling and band spacing, not selectively abolishing products beyond the first repeat while preserving a strong $+6$-nt product. The observed strong $18$-nt G-labeled product is inconsistent with such a template change.\n  - B: A reduced $k_{\\text{cat}}$ with intact processivity would slow all additions uniformly; after fixed time, multiple ladder bands would still be present (albeit with overall reduced intensity), not exclusively the first $+6$-nt product.\n  - C: A defect in translocation after one repeat exactly explains a dominant $18$-nt band with absent/vanishing longer products.\n  - D: Preventing primer binding would abolish all products; the observed $18$-nt band contradicts this.\n  - E: Decreasing $K_{M}$ for dNTPs would increase catalytic efficiency, tending to enhance, not eliminate, longer products.\n\nTherefore, the most likely defect is severely impaired translocation after synthesizing a single repeat.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341448"}, {"introduction": "In cells with active telomerase, telomeres do not grow indefinitely; their length is carefully regulated.

The analysis proceeds from first principles as defined in the problem statement.\n\nLet $L$ be the length of a telomere in base pairs (bp). The expected net change in telomere length per cell division, which we denote as $\\langle \\Delta L \\rangle_L$, is the sum of the deterministic loss and the expected stochastic gain.\n\nThe deterministic loss due to the end-replication problem is given as a constant, $s$. This contribution to the change in length is $-s$.\n\nThe lengthening process is mediated by telomerase. The enzyme adds an average of $\\mu$ bp upon a successful engagement with the telomere end. The probability of this engagement, $p(L)$, is dependent on the telomere length $L$ and is given by the function:\n$$\np(L) = p_{0} \\exp(-\\alpha L)\n$$\nwhere $p_{0}$ is the maximum access probability at $L=0$ and $\\alpha$ is a parameter characterizing the occlusion effect. The problem states we can assume at most one productive engagement per division. Therefore, the expected gain in length per division is the magnitude of the extension, $\\mu$, multiplied by the probability of its occurrence, $p(L)$.\n$$\n\\text{Expected Gain} = \\mu \\cdot p(L) = \\mu p_{0} \\exp(-\\alpha L)\n$$\nThe expected net change in length per division for a telomere of length $L$ is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta L \\rangle_L = -s + \\mu p_{0} \\exp(-\\alpha L)\n$$\nA steady state is achieved when the population of telomeres maintains a constant average length. This implies that the expected net change in length at the steady-state length, $L^{\\ast}$, must be zero.\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta L \\rangle_{L=L^{\\ast}} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $L^{\\ast}$ into the expression for the expected net change gives the condition for steady state:\n$$\n-s + \\mu p_{0} \\exp(-\\alpha L^{\\ast}) = 0\n$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $L^{\\ast}$. First, isolate the term containing $L^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\mu p_{0} \\exp(-\\alpha L^{\\ast}) = s\n$$\nNext, divide by $\\mu p_{0}$ to isolate the exponential function. The parameters $\\mu$ and $p_{0}$ are given as positive, so this division is well-defined.\n$$\n\\exp(-\\alpha L^{\\ast}) = \\frac{s}{\\mu p_{0}}\n$$\nTo solve for the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp(-\\alpha L^{\\ast})\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{s}{\\mu p_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property that $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, we get:\n$$\n-\\alpha L^{\\ast} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{s}{\\mu p_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $L^{\\ast}$ by dividing by $-\\alpha$. The parameter $\\alpha$ is given as positive ($\\alpha > 0$), so this is a valid operation.\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{s}{\\mu p_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, we can write the expression in a more intuitive form:\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mu p_{0}}{s}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state telomere length $L^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe problem also asks for the condition under which $L^{\\ast}$ is positive. Since length must be a non-negative quantity, a physically meaningful steady-state length must satisfy $L^{\\ast} > 0$. Given that $\\alpha > 0$, the term $1/\\alpha$ is positive. Therefore, the sign of $L^{\\ast}$ is determined by the sign of the logarithmic term. The natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ is positive if and only if its argument $x$ is greater than $1$.\nThus, for $L^{\\ast} > 0$, we require:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu p_{0}}{s} > 1\n$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\mu p_{0} > s\n$$\nThis condition has a clear physical interpretation. The term $\\mu p_{0}$ represents the maximum possible expected telomere extension per division, which occurs when the telomere length approaches zero ($L \\to 0$, so $p(L) \\to p_{0}$). The parameter $s$ is the constant rate of shortening. The condition $\\mu p_{0} > s$ states that for a stable, positive telomere length to exist, the maximum rate of enzymatic extension must exceed the rate of replicative loss. If this condition is not met ($\\mu p_{0} \\le s$), the shortening process will always be dominant or equal to the maximum possible lengthening, leading to progressive telomere loss and an inability to establish a positive steady-state length.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mu p_{0}}{s}\\right)}$$", "id": "2856991"}]}
