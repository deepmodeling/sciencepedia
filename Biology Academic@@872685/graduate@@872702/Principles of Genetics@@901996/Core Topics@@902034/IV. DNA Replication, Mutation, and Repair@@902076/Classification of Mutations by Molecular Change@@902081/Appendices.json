The concepts of codons, reading frames, and the effects of in-frame versus frameshift mutations are fundamental to genetics. The provided genetic code information is correct. The problem is well-posed, providing a specific DNA sequence and a clear, answerable question. The language is objective and technical. The setup is self-contained and consistent. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws are detected in the problem statement itself.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe original DNA coding strand is $5'$–ATG GAA TTT CCG GAC TGA–$3'$.\nThe reading frame is established from the beginning, grouping the sequence into codons:\n- Codon 1: ATG (encodes Methionine)\n- Codon 2: GAA (encodes Glutamate)\n- Codon 3: TTT (encodes Phenylalanine)\n- Codon 4: CCG (encodes Proline)\n- Codon 5: GAC (encodes Aspartate)\n- Codon 6: TGA (Stop codon)\n\nThe polypeptide chain produced from this sequence is: Met-Glu-Phe-Pro-Asp.\n\nThe problem requires an example of a $3$-base deletion that removes an entire codon and preserves the downstream reading frame. Such a deletion, known as an in-frame deletion, must remove $3$ consecutive bases that constitute a single codon. This results in the removal of one amino acid from the polypeptide chain while the amino acids encoded downstream of the mutation remain unchanged.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Delete the three nucleotides TTT corresponding exactly to the phenylalanine codon (positions $7$–$9$ of the coding strand), producing $5'$–ATG GAA CCG GAC TGA–$3'$; classification: deletion; predicted protein change: loss of a single phenylalanine with all downstream amino acids unchanged.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option proposes deleting the codon TTT, which occupies positions $7$, $8$, and $9$.\n- Original sequence: $5'$–ATG GAA **TTT** CCG GAC TGA–$3'$\n- Proposed new sequence: $5'$–ATG GAA CCG GAC TGA–$3'$\n- The new codon sequence is:\n    - ATG (Met)\n    - GAA (Glu)\n    - CCG (Pro)\n    - GAC (Asp)\n    - TGA (Stop)\n- The new polypeptide is: Met-Glu-Pro-Asp.\n- **Comparison:** The Phenylalanine residue has been deleted. The downstream amino acids, Proline and Aspartate, are unaffected. The reading frame is preserved. The classification as a deletion and the predicted protein change are entirely correct. This is a canonical example of an in-frame deletion of a single codon.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Delete the third nucleotide of TTT only (position $9$ of the coding strand), producing $5'$–ATG GAA TT CCG GAC TGA–$3'$; classification: deletion; predicted protein change: frameshift beginning at phenylalanine, altering all downstream amino acids and likely the stop position.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option proposes a $1$-base deletion. According to the principle stated in the problem, a deletion of a length that is not a multiple of $3$ will cause a frameshift.\n- Original sequence: $5'$–ATG GAA TTT CCG GAC TGA–$3'$\n- After deleting the T at position $9$: $5'$–ATG GAA TTC CGG ACT GA–$3'$\n- The new reading frame is:\n    - ATG (Met)\n    - GAA (Glu)\n    - TTC (Phe)\n    - CGG (Arg)\n    - ACT (Thr)\n    - GA... (incomplete codon, new stop codon is shifted or eliminated)\n- **Comparison:** The reading frame is shifted from the third codon onwards, altering all subsequent amino acids. This exemplifies a frameshift mutation, which is the opposite of the phenomenon the question asks to illustrate.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Delete three nucleotides spanning the last two bases of TTT and the first base of CCG (positions $8$–$10$ of the coding strand), producing $5'$–ATG GAA T TGG ACT GA–$3'$; classification: deletion; predicted protein change: removal of precisely one phenylalanine with downstream amino acids unchanged.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option has multiple errors.\n- **Error 1: Incorrect resulting sequence.** The deletion of bases at positions $8$, $9$, and $10$ (which are T, T, and C, respectively) from the original sequence $5'$–ATG GAA T**TTC**CG GAC TGA–$3'$ would result in $5'$–ATG GAA TCG GAC TGA–$3'$. The sequence given in the option, $5'$–ATG GAA T TGG ACT GA–$3'$, is not derivable from the specified operation.\n- **Error 2: Incorrect protein change prediction.** Let us analyze the consequence of the correctly derived sequence, $5'$–ATG GAA TCG GAC TGA–$3'$.\n    - The new codons are: ATG (Met), GAA (Glu), TCG (Serine), GAC (Asp), TGA (Stop).\n    - The resulting polypeptide would be Met-Glu-Ser-Asp.\n    - Compared to the original (Met-Glu-Phe-Pro-Asp), this mutation does not result in the \"removal of precisely one phenylalanine\". Instead, it is a complex mutation where Phenylalanine and Proline are replaced by a single Serine (as the deletion spans two codons). A more precise description is that Phe is mutated to Ser, Pro is deleted and the frame is maintained. The statement in the option \"removal of precisely one phenylalanine with downstream amino acids unchanged\" is a gross mischaracterization. In this specific case, the number of amino acids is reduced by one, but it is not due to a simple deletion of one amino acid.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is internally inconsistent and its description of the outcome is factually wrong.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D.

This option describes an **insertion**. Although the outcome described (in-frame insertion of an amino acid) is mechanistically related, the type of mutation is incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A correctly demonstrates, by both mechanism and example, a $3$-base deletion that removes an entire codon while preserving the downstream reading frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2799675"}, {"introduction": "Observed differences between two DNA sequences are often the net result of multiple historical mutational events.

The definitions provided are standard. The sequences are composed of valid nucleotides. The problem is well-posed, asking for a \"minimal set\" of edits, which corresponds to finding the shortest edit path between two strings, a classic and solvable problem in bioinformatics. The problem is stated objectively and contains all necessary information. It is free from the flaws listed in the instructions, such as scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or incompleteness.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nLet the wild-type sequence be denoted by $W$ and the mutant sequence by $M$.\nThe length of the wild-type sequence is $L_W = 11$ nucleotides.\nThe length of the mutant sequence is $L_M = 12$ nucleotides.\n\nThe change in sequence length is $\\Delta L = L_M - L_W = 12 - 11 = 1$. According to the provided definitions, this net increase of one nucleotide must result from the number of inserted bases being one greater than the number of deleted bases. Let $N_{ins}$ be the number of inserted nucleotides and $N_{del}$ be the number of deleted nucleotides. Then, $N_{ins} - N_{del} = 1$. The simplest scenario satisfying this condition is one insertion ($N_{ins}=1$) and zero deletions ($N_{del}=0$).\n\nThe question asks for the minimal set of edit operations. Let us analyze the minimum number of operations required.\nA single operation, an insertion, would result in a sequence of length $12$. However, it would consist of the $11$ original wild-type bases in their original order, plus one inserted base. Let's examine if this is possible.\nThe ordered sequence of bases in $W$ is (C, G, T, A, C, T, G, A, C, C, A).\nIf we assume a single insertion, the subsequence of $11$ bases in $M$ corresponding to the original $W$ bases must match this sequence.\nThe sequence of bases in $M$ is (C, G, T, A, T, C, T, A, A, C, C, A).\nBy inspection, there is no single base we can remove from $M$ to recover the sequence of $W$. For instance, if we remove $T_5$, we get `CGTACTAACCA`. This differs from $W$ (`CGTACTGACCA`) at position $7$ (G vs A) and position $8$ (A vs A), position 9 (C vs C)... there are multiple differences. Specifically, the G at position 7 in $W$ is absent from $M$. Therefore, more than one edit operation is required. The minimal number of edits must be at least two.\n\nLet us test the hypothesis of two edits. To satisfy $N_{ins} - N_{del} = 1$, the two edits must be one insertion and one substitution. This leads us to investigate options B and D.\n\nTo find the minimal edits, we perform a sequence alignment between $W$ and $M$.\n$W: 5'$-C G T A C T G A C C A-$3'$\n$M: 5'$-C G T A T C T A A C C A-$3'$\n\nWe can see common anchors at the beginning ($5'$-CGTA) and at the end ($3'$-CCA).\nAligning by these anchors:\n$W: \\text{C G T A}\\ [ \\text{C T G A} ]\\ \\text{C C A}$\n$M: \\text{C G T A}\\ [ \\text{T C T A A} ]\\ \\text{C C A}$\n\nWe must find the minimal edits to transform the substring $W' = \\text{CTGA}$ into $M' = \\text{TCTAA}$.\nTo find the minimal edits for these substrings, we align them:\n$W'`:  - C T G A`\n$M'`:  T C T A A`\nThis alignment reveals two differences:\n1. An insertion of `T` in $M'$ relative to $W'$.\n2. A substitution of `G` in $W'$ with `A` in $M'$.\n\nLet's reconstruct the full alignment based on this:\n$W: \\text{C G T A - C T G A C C A}$\n$M: \\text{C G T A T C T A A C C A}$\n\nLet's verify this alignment.\n- Positions $1-4$ of $W$ (`CGTA`) align with positions $1-4$ of $M$ (`CGTA`). Match.\n- At the next position, $W$ has a gap, and $M$ has a `T` (at position $5$). This corresponds to an **insertion of `T`**. This insertion occurs after position $4$ ('A') of the wild-type sequence and before position $5$ ('C').\n- Position $5$ of $W$ (`C`) aligns with position $6$ of $M$ (`C`). Match.\n- Position $6$ of $W$ (`T`) aligns with position $7$ of $M$ (`T`). Match.\n- Position $7$ of $W$ (`G`) aligns with position $8$ of $M$ (`A`). This is a **substitution of `G` with `A`**. This occurs at wild-type position $7$.\n- Position $8$ of $W$ (`A`) aligns with position $9$ of $M$ (`A`). Match.\n- Positions $9-11$ of $W$ (`CCA`) align with positions $10-12$ of $M$ (`CCA`). Match.\n\nThis alignment fully transforms $W$ to $M$ with two edits: one insertion and one substitution. Since the minimum number of edits is greater than one, this two-edit solution is minimal.\n\nThe identified minimal edits are:\n1. Insertion of a `T` nucleotide between wild-type position $4$ and position $5$.\n2. Substitution of the nucleotide at wild-type position $7$ from `G` to `A`.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\n**Option A:** `one substitution`, `one insertion`, `one deletion`. This is a total of $3$ edits. Since we found a valid solution with $2$ edits, this cannot be the minimal set.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B:** `one insertion`, `one substitution`. The specified edits are: `Insertion of T between wild-type positions 4 and 5` and `Base substitution at wild-type position 7: G->A`. This perfectly matches our derived minimal set of edits.\nLet's verify this operation set transforms $W$ to $M$.\n$W = 5'$-CGTACTGACCA-$3'$\n1. Insertion of `T` after position $4$: $W_1 = 5'$-CGTA`T`CTGACCA-$3'$.\n2. Substitution at original wild-type position $7$ (`G` to `A`): The `G` at position $7$ in $W$ is now at position $8$ in $W_1$. Changing this `G` to `A` gives $5'$-CGTATCTA`A`CCA-$3'$.\nThe resulting sequence is $5'$-CGTATCTAACCA-$3'$, which is identical to the mutant sequence $M$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option C:** `three substitutions`. A set of only substitutions cannot change the length of the sequence. The wild-type length is $11$ and the mutant length is $12$. It is therefore a logical impossibility to produce the mutant sequence from the wild-type using only substitutions.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:** `one insertion`, `one substitution`. The specified edits are: `Insertion of T between wild-type positions 5 and 6` and `Base substitution at wild-type position 7: G->A`. Let's apply these edits.\n$W = 5'$-CGTACTGACCA-$3'$\n1. Insertion of `T` after position $5$: $W_1 = 5'$-CGTAC`T`TGACCA-$3'$.\n2. Substitution at wild-type position $7$ (`G` to `A`): The `G` from $W$ is now at position $8$ in $W_1$. Changing this gives $5'$-CGTACTT`A`ACCA-$3'$.\nThe resulting sequence, $5'$-CGTACTTAACCA-$3'$, is not the same as the mutant sequence $M$, $5'$-CGTATCTAACCA-$3'$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on rigorous analysis, Option B is the only one that correctly identifies the minimal set of edit operations to transform the wild-type sequence into the mutant sequence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2799715"}, {"introduction": "In modern genomics, raw sequence data can suggest complex and overlapping mutational events, which must be described in a standardized way for clarity and database compatibility.

There are no scientific or factual unsoundness, no ambiguities, and no other invalidating flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nFirst, the alternate allele sequence resulting from the three primitive events must be constructed. The events are described relative to the original reference sequence.\n\nThe reference sequence is:\nCoordinates: `$1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \\ 7 \\ 8 \\ 9 \\ 10 \\ 11 \\ 12 \\ 13 \\ 14 \\ 15 \\ 16 \\ 17 \\ 18$`\nReference:   `$A \\ C \\ G \\ T \\ A \\ A \\ A \\ A \\ G \\ T \\ A \\ A \\ A \\ A \\ C \\ C \\ C \\ G$`\n\nThe events are clustered around positions `$8$`, `$9$`, `$10$`, and `$11$`. We will determine the final composition of this region in the alternate allele.\n\n1.  The sequence is unchanged up to position `$8$`. The prefix is `$ACGTAAAA$`.\n2.  An insertion of `TA` occurs after position `$8$`.\n3.  The reference nucleotides `$G$` at position `$9$` and `$T$` at position `$10$` are deleted.\n4.  The reference nucleotide `$A$` at position `$11$` is substituted with `$G$`.\n5.  The sequence is unchanged from position `$12$` to `$18$`. The suffix is `$AAACCCG$`.\n\nTo construct the alternate allele, we consider the effect of these operations on the reference sequence. The reference segment from position `$9$` to `$11$` is `$GTA$`. Let's determine the new sequence segment that replaces it.\n- Start with the base at position `$8$`, which is `$A$`.\n- After this `$A$`, insert `TA`.\n- The reference bases `$G$` (position `$9$`) and `$T$` (position `$10$`) are deleted.\n- The reference base `$A$` (position `$11$`) is replaced by `$G$`.\nThe resulting sequence segment that functionally replaces the reference `$GTA$` (at positions `$9-11$`) is therefore `$TAG$`.\n\nThe full alternate allele sequence is the concatenation of the prefix, the new segment, and the suffix:\nAlternate Sequence = `$(ACGTAAAA) + (TAG) + (AAACCCG) = ACGTAAAATAGAAACCCG$`\n\nNext, we normalize this complex variant. Normalization requires representing the change as a single, minimal, left-aligned event.\n- Reference: `$ACGTAAAA \\ G T A \\ AAACCCG$`\n- Alternate: `$ACGTAAAA \\ T A G \\ AAACCCG$`\n\nThe comparison shows that the change begins at position `$9$`. The reference segment `$GTA$` (from positions `$9$` to `$11$`) is replaced by the alternate segment `$TAG$`. The variant can be described as a deletion of `$GTA$` and an insertion of `$TAG$` at this locus.\n\nThe variant alleles are:\n- Reference allele: `$GTA$`\n- Alternate allele: `$TAG$`\n\nThis representation is minimal because the alleles share no common prefix or suffix that could be trimmed. It is left-aligned because the change cannot be shifted further to the left (to a lower coordinate). Shifting would require that the base at position `$8$` (`$A$`) be identical to the last base of both alleles, which is not the case (`$A \\neq G$`). Thus, the change is correctly anchored at position `$9$`.\n\nThe normalized variant is a replacement of the reference bases `$GTA$` at positions `$9-11$` with the sequence `$TAG$`.\n\nFinally, we determine the molecular classification and the HGVS description.\n\n- **Molecular Classification**: The variant is a replacement of a `$3$`-nucleotide sequence by another `$3$`-nucleotide sequence. According to the problem's definition, an equal-length deletion-insertion \"reduces to a multi-nucleotide substitution\". Therefore, the correct classification is **base substitution (multi-nucleotide substitution)**.\n\n- **HGVS Description**: The problem provides a specific rule for `$g.$` (genomic) nomenclature: `delins` must be used for replacements of more than one nucleotide. Since `$3$` nucleotides are replaced, `delins` is the correct term. The `>` operator is forbidden here.\n    - Reference Identifier: `REFGENE:EX1`\n    - Coordinates of the replaced segment: `$9\\_11$`\n    - Operation: `delins`\n    - Inserted sequence: `$TAG$`\n    - The complete HGVS description is `REFGENE:EX1:g.9_11delinsTAG`.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A.

The net length change is zero, not an increase.\n    - The HGVS description represents only one of the three un-normalized primitive events and fails to describe the full, collapsed change.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Deletion plus substitution (kept as separate events); `REFGENE:EX1:g.[9_10delGT;11A>G]`**\n    - This fails to follow the rule of collapsing adjacent events into a single representation. It also completely omits the insertion of `TA`, thereby describing a different final sequence.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Deletion-insertion; `REFGENE:EX1:g.9_11delinsTGA`**\n    - While \"Deletion-insertion\" is a plausible classification, the HGVS description provides the incorrect inserted sequence (`TGA` instead of the derived `TAG`).\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Base substitution; `REFGENE:EX1:g.9_11GTA>TAG`**\n    - The HGVS description uses the `>` operator. According to the problem's rules, this operator is strictly for single-nucleotide substitutions. This variant involves `$3$` nucleotides, so using `>` is forbidden.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A provides both the correct molecular classification and the correct HGVS description according to all the rules and definitions given in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2799640"}]}
