Each fork synthesizes one leading strand and one lagging strand, with the lagging strand synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments that each require a single primase (DnaG) initiation event to start a ribonucleic acid (RNA) primer.

Replication begins at a single origin of replication, denoted as *oriC*. The process is bidirectional, which is the first core definition provided. This means that two replication forks are established, and they proceed in opposite directions around the circle. Let us label them Fork $1$ and Fork $2$. For the entire chromosome to be replicated, these two forks must collectively traverse the entire circular DNA. They will meet at a termination site, which, for a symmetric bidirectional process starting from a single point, is located diametrically opposite to *oriC*. Therefore, each fork traverses a path length equal to half the chromosome's circumference.\n\nDistance traversed by Fork $1$ $= \\frac{L}{2}$.\nDistance traversed by Fork $2$ $= \\frac{L}{2}$.\n\nAt each replication fork, the double-stranded DNA is unwound, and both strands serve as templates for the synthesis of new DNA. One strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of fork movement; this is the leading strand. The other strand is synthesized discontinuously in the opposite direction to fork movement; this is the lagging strand. This means there are two lagging strands being synthesized in total, one associated with each of the two replication forks.\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of primase initiation events on the lagging strands. The synthesis of each discontinuous segment of the lagging strand, known as an Okazaki fragment, requires a ribonucleic acid (RNA) primer synthesized by the DnaG primase. The problem explicitly states we are to assume that each Okazaki fragment requires a single primase initiation event. Thus, the total number of primase events on lagging strands is equal to the total number of Okazaki fragments synthesized. Also, we are instructed to ignore the initiation events for the leading strands, which simplifies the problem to considering only the repetitive initiations on the lagging strands.\n\nTo find the total number of Okazaki fragments, we must first determine the total length of the template DNA that is replicated via lagging strand synthesis. For Fork $1$, the length of the template for its lagging strand is equal to the distance it travels, which is $\\frac{L}{2}$. Similarly, for Fork $2$, the length of the template for its lagging strand is also $\\frac{L}{2}$. The total template length for all lagging strand synthesis, $L_{\\text{lagging}}$, is the sum of the lengths from both forks:\n$$L_{\\text{lagging}} = \\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{L}{2} = L$$\n\nNow, we apply the third core definition provided: the number of Okazaki fragments on a lagging strand is the lagging-strand template length traversed divided by the average fragment length. Let $N_{\\text{Ok}}$ be the total number of Okazaki fragments and $s$ be the average length of an Okazaki fragment. Applying this principle to the total lagging strand length:\n$$N_{\\text{Ok}} = \\frac{L_{\\text{lagging}}}{s}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $L_{\\text{lagging}}$, we get:\n$$N_{\\text{Ok}} = \\frac{L}{s}$$\n\nAs established, the total number of primase initiation events on lagging strands, which we denote as $N_{\\text{primase}}$, is equal to the total number of Okazaki fragments.\n$$N_{\\text{primase}} = N_{\\text{Ok}}$$\nTherefore, the final derived expression for the total number of primase events is:\n$$N_{\\text{primase}} = \\frac{L}{s}$$\nIt is important to note that the rate of replication fork progression, $v$, is not required for this calculation. The question asks for the total stoichiometric count of events for a complete replication cycle, not the kinetics or time-dependence of these events. The inclusion of $v$ is extraneous to the question posed.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression numerically using the given parameters:\n- Chromosome length: $L = 4.64 \\times 10^{6}$ nucleotides (nt)\n- Average Okazaki fragment length: $s = 1.50 \\times 10^{3}$ nt\n\nSubstituting these values into our expression:\n$$N_{\\text{primase}} = \\frac{4.64 \\times 10^{6}}{1.50 \\times 10^{3}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{primase}} = \\frac{4.64}{1.50} \\times 10^{(6 - 3)}$$\n$$N_{\\text{primase}} = 3.09333... \\times 10^{3}$$\n$$N_{\\text{primase}} = 3093.333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $0$, $9$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$N_{\\text{primase}} \\approx 3093$$\nThis is the final numerical result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3093}$$", "id": "2842182"}, {"introduction": "Having established the scale of replication, we now examine its speed. This practice moves beyond a simple, constant velocity model to incorporate the start-and-stop nature of the replication fork, where the helicase pauses for primase to act.

At each fork, the replicative helicase unwinds the parental duplex ahead of the replisome, and the leading and lagging strands are synthesized by the replicative polymerase. On the lagging strand, primase periodically initiates Okazaki fragments, and each priming event imposes a transient helicase pause via helicase–primase coupling.\n\nAssume the following well-supported features and parameters of the prokaryotic replication machinery:\n- Two forks initiate synchronously at *oriC* and progress symmetrically around the chromosome; the minimal completion time is set by fork progression and geometry.\n- Fork advancement is limited by the helicase when polymerase is not rate-limiting.\n- The helicase advances at an instantaneous unwinding speed of $v_h$ when not paused.\n- Okazaki fragments have a mean contour length of $\\ell_O$ along the template. After the fork advances by $\\ell_O$, primase initiates the next fragment, imposing a helicase pause of fixed duration $\\tau_p$.

This time is determined by the effective speed of the replication forks. The motion of each fork is not continuous; it is a sequence of advancement and pausing events.\n\nFirst, we must derive the effective fork advance speed, which we shall denote $v_{eff}$. This is the average speed over one complete cycle of motion. A single cycle consists of two distinct phases:\n$1$. The helicase advances by a distance equal to the mean contour length of an Okazaki fragment, $\\ell_O$, at its instantaneous speed, $v_h$.\n$2$.

The chromosome is circular with a total length of $L$. Replication initiates at a single origin, *oriC*, and proceeds bidirectionally. This means two replication forks are established, moving in opposite directions around the circular chromosome. They will meet in the terminus region, which is diametrically opposite to the origin. Therefore, each fork must traverse a distance equal to half the chromosome length. Let this distance be $D$.\n$$D = \\frac{L}{2}$$\nThe total time for replication, $T_{rep}$, is the time required for a fork to travel the distance $D$ at the effective speed $v_{eff}$.\n$$T_{rep} = \\frac{D}{v_{eff}} = \\frac{L/2}{v_{eff}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{eff}$ into this equation, we obtain the final formula for the total replication time:\n$$T_{rep} = \\frac{L}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{v_{eff}} \\right) = \\frac{L}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{v_h} + \\frac{\\tau_p}{\\ell_O} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe parameters are:\n- $L = 4.6 \\times 10^{6}$ nucleotides\n- $v_h = 800$ nucleotides/second\n- $\\ell_O = 1500$ nucleotides\n- $\\tau_p = 0.15$ seconds\n\nWe first compute the term in the parenthesis, which represents the total time required to advance by one nucleotide (the \"slowness\"):\n$$\\frac{1}{v_h} + \\frac{\\tau_p}{\\ell_O} = \\frac{1}{800} \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}} + \\frac{0.15 \\text{ s}}{1500 \\text{ nt}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{v_h} = 0.00125 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\tau_p}{\\ell_O} = 0.0001 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}}$$\nSumming these values gives:\n$$0.00125 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}} + 0.0001 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}} = 0.00135 \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{nt}}$$\nNow, we calculate the total replication time, $T_{rep}$, in seconds:\n$$T_{rep} = \\frac{4.6 \\times 10^{6}}{2} \\times 0.00135 \\text{ s}$$\n$$T_{rep} = (2.3 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (1.35 \\times 10^{-3}) \\text{ s}$$\n$$T_{rep} = 2.3 \\times 1.35 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ s}$$\n$$T_{rep} = 3.105 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ s} = 3105 \\text{ s}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in minutes.

The initiation threshold is defined by the condition $W_{\\text{drive}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{melt}}$. We must analyze how the specified mutation affects the terms in this equation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the mutation on $\\Delta G_{\\text{melt}}$**:\n    - The wild-type DUE has an AT-content of $75\\%$, which implies a GC-content of $100\\% - 75\\% = 25\\%$.\n    - The mutant DUE has an AT-content of $60\\%$, which implies a GC-content of $100\\% - 60\\% = 40\\%$.\n    - The mutation results in an increase in the GC-content of the DUE.\n    - According to the given fact (i), the melting free energy cost, $\\Delta G_{\\text{melt}}$, increases with GC content. This is because GC base pairs are stabilized by three hydrogen bonds, whereas AT base pairs are stabilized by only two.\n    - Therefore, the melting energy for the mutant is higher than for the wild-type: $\\Delta G_{\\text{melt, mutant}}  \\Delta G_{\\text{melt, wild-type}}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the consequence for the initiation threshold**:\n    - The initiation threshold is the condition where the driving work equals the melting cost. For the mutant, this condition is $W_{\\text{drive}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{melt, mutant}}$.\n    - Since $\\Delta G_{\\text{melt, mutant}}$ has increased, the amount of driving work, $W_{\\text{drive}}$, required to reach this threshold must also be higher.\n    - This means that the initiation threshold itself has increased. A greater energetic input is now necessary to achieve duplex melting.\n\n3.  **Interpret the change in terms of molecular mechanisms**:\n    - The driving work, $W_{\\text{drive}}$, is provided by two main sources as per fact (ii): DnaA–ATP oligomerization and negative superhelical density ($\\sigma$).\n    - To generate a larger $W_{\\text{drive}}$, the cell must augment these contributing factors. This implies that one or both of the following conditions must be met:\n        - An increase in the amount or activity of the DnaA–ATP complex bound at the origin. Biologically, this often correlates with a higher cellular concentration of the initiator protein.\n        - An increase in the magnitude of the negative superhelical density. A more negative value of $\\sigma$ (e.g., changing from $\\sigma = -0.05$ to $\\sigma = -0.07$) signifies a more underwound helix, which stores more torsional energy that can facilitate strand separation. Thus, a larger magnitude of $\\sigma$ is required.\n    - In summary, the mutation makes initiation more difficult. The cell must reach a state of higher initiator availability (more DnaA–ATP) and/or higher torsional stress (more negative $\\sigma$) before replication can begin. Other factors that facilitate melting, such as increased temperature providing thermal energy, would also help overcome the higher energy barrier.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. The initiation threshold increases: more DnaA–ATP occupancy and/or a more negative superhelical density (larger magnitude of $\\sigma$) will be required to achieve $W_{\\text{drive}}=\\Delta G_{\\text{melt}}$, effectively shifting initiation to conditions with higher initiator availability or facilitating factors such as higher temperature.**\n  - This statement accurately reflects the derived conclusion. The increase in GC content raises $\\Delta G_{\\text{melt}}$, which in turn increases the required $W_{\\text{drive}}$ for initiation. This necessitates a greater contribution from DnaA–ATP and/or negative supercoiling. The interpretation that this shifts initiation to conditions of higher initiator availability is correct.\n  - **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n- **B. The initiation threshold decreases: less initiator and weaker negative supercoiling are needed because GC substitutions enhance spontaneous bubble formation once nucleated.**\n  - This statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. The threshold *increases*, not decreases. The central physical reason provided, \"GC substitutions enhance spontaneous bubble formation,\" is factually wrong. GC pairs stabilize the duplex, making bubble formation more difficult, not easier.\n  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n- **C. There is no net change in threshold: the DnaA binding energy automatically compensates for changes in base composition at the DUE, keeping $W_{\\text{drive}}=\\Delta G_{\\text{melt}}$ unchanged.**\n  - This statement is incorrect. It contradicts fact (i) that $\\Delta G_{\\text{melt}}$ increases with GC content, which implies the threshold must change. The problem also specifies that DnaA recognition sites are unchanged, providing no basis for an \"automatic compensation\" mechanism in DnaA binding energy. The mutation is in the DUE, the site of melting, which is distinct from the primary DnaA binding boxes.\n  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n- **D. The origin becomes less sensitive to changes in negative superhelical density because the higher base-stacking energy of GC stabilizes the open complex after formation, reducing the need for torsional work.**\n  - This statement presents flawed reasoning. Since melting is now energetically more costly, the system should become *more*, not less, dependent on facilitating factors like negative supercoiling. The need for torsional work is *increased*, not reduced. Furthermore, the stabilization of an \"open complex\" by stronger pairing (GC) is a nonsensical concept; the open complex is by definition unpaired, and the higher stability of GC pairs resists, rather than aids, its formation.\n  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2842175"}]}
