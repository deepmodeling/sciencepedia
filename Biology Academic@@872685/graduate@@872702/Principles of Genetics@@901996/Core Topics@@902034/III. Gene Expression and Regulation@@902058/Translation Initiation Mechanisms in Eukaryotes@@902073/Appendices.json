In cap-dependent initiation, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binds the $5^{\\prime}$ cap and recruits the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex to promote ribosomal scanning.

The provided dissociation constants and concentrations are within realistic ranges for in vitro experiments. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive the requested quantities. The language is objective and precise. The problem is neither trivial nor ill-posed, as it requires the application of equilibrium principles and a justified approximation based on the provided concentration regimes.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe binding of the protein eIF4E ($E$) to an RNA cap site ($R$) to form a complex ($ER$) is described by the reversible reaction $E + R \\rightleftharpoons ER$. The law of mass action at equilibrium gives the dissociation constant $K_{d}$ as:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[E][R]}{[ER]}$$\nwhere $[E]$, $[R]$, and $[ER]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the free protein, free RNA cap site, and the protein-RNA complex, respectively.\n\nWe are asked to derive the equilibrium fraction of occupied cap sites, denoted as $\\theta$. For a specific type of cap, which we will index by $i$ (where $i$ is either cap0 or cap1), this fraction is defined as the concentration of occupied sites divided by the total concentration of sites of that type:\n$$\\theta_{i} = \\frac{[ER_i]}{[R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nThe total concentration of cap sites of type $i$, $[R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of free and bound sites:\n$$[R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [R_i] + [ER_i]$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of free sites as $[R_i] = [R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [ER_i]$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R_i]$ into the $K_{d,i}$ equation:\n$$K_{d,i} = \\frac{[E]([R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [ER_i])}{[ER_i]}$$\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the complex, $[ER_i]$:\n$$K_{d,i} [ER_i] = [E][R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [E][ER_i]$$\n$$[ER_i](K_{d,i} + [E]) = [E][R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n$$[ER_i] = \\frac{[E][R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,i} + [E]}$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the definition of the fractional occupancy, $\\theta_i$:\n$$\\theta_{i} = \\frac{1}{[R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{[E][R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,i} + [E]} \\right)$$\n$$\\theta_{i} = \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,i} + [E]}$$\nThis is the required expression for the equilibrium fraction of occupied cap sites in terms of the free eIF4E concentration $[E]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d,i}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the free eIF4E concentration, $[E]$. The total concentration of eIF4E is given by the mass balance equation:\n$$[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [E] + [ER_{\\mathrm{cap0}}] + [ER_{\\mathrm{cap1}}]$$\nThe problem states that the total RNA concentration is $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ and that the two cap types are present in equal molar amounts. Therefore:\n$$[R_{\\mathrm{cap0}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [R_{\\mathrm{cap1}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{2} = \\frac{5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{2} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$$\nThe total concentration of eIF4E is $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 500\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\nWe must now justify any approximations. The total concentration of cap binding sites is $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$, while the total concentration of the binding protein eIF4E is $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 500\\ \\mathrm{nM}$. We observe that $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\gg [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$; specifically, the protein is in a $100$-fold molar excess over the total binding sites.\nThe total concentration of bound eIF4E is $[ER_{\\mathrm{cap0}}] + [ER_{\\mathrm{cap1}}]$. By definition, the maximum possible concentration of bound protein occurs when all RNA sites are occupied, so $[ER_{\\mathrm{total, max}}] = [R_{\\mathrm{cap0}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} + [R_{\\mathrm{cap1}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\nThis maximum bound concentration represents only $\\frac{5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{500\\ \\mathrm{nM}} = 0.01 = 1\\%$ of the total eIF4E. Since such a small fraction of the total eIF4E can be bound to RNA, the concentration of free eIF4E, $[E]$, is approximately equal to the total eIF4E concentration, $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$[E] \\approx [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThis approximation is well-justified by the large excess of protein over binding sites.\n\nThe problem states that the steady-state initiation efficiency, $\\eta$, is directly proportional to the fraction of occupied mRNA, $\\theta$. Thus, $\\eta_i = c \\cdot \\theta_i$ for some proportionality constant $c$. We need to compute the ratio of initiation efficiencies of cap1 relative to cap0:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{cap1}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{cap0}}} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{cap1}}}{c \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{cap0}}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{cap1}}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{cap0}}}$$\nUsing our derived expression for $\\theta_i$:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{cap1}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{cap0}}} = \\frac{\\frac{[E]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{cap1}} + [E]}}{\\frac{[E]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{cap0}} + [E]}} = \\frac{K_{d,\\mathrm{cap0}} + [E]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{cap1}} + [E]}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, ensuring consistent units (all in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$):\n- $K_{d,\\mathrm{cap0}} = 1.20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_{d,\\mathrm{cap1}} = 0.300\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[E] \\approx 0.50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\n$$\\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{cap1}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{cap0}}} = \\frac{1.20 + 0.50}{0.300 + 0.50} = \\frac{1.70}{0.800} = 2.125$$\nThe result $2.125$ has four significant figures, as required for the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.125}$$", "id": "2861866"}, {"introduction": "Quantifying changes in protein synthesis is central to understanding gene regulation, and ribosome profiling is a powerful tool for this purpose.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary data, assumptions, and a clear objective. The language used is objective and technical. No contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies are present. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the log base $2$ fold-change in translation efficiency ($TE$) between two conditions, cap-limited ($\\mathcal{D}$) and cap-competent ($\\mathcal{C}$).\n\nFirst, we define the per-replicate translation efficiency and its properties. Translation efficiency is given as:\n$$TE = \\frac{\\text{RPF}_{\\text{normalized}}}{\\text{RNA}_{\\text{normalized}}}$$\nThe analysis is performed on the natural logarithm scale.

Since $Y_i$ and $X_i$ are independent, their difference, $Z_i = Y_i - X_i$, is also a normally distributed random variable. The mean of $Z_i$ is $E[Z_i] = E[Y_i] - E[X_i]$, and its variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(Z_i) = \\operatorname{Var}(Y_i - X_i) = \\operatorname{Var}(Y_i) + \\operatorname{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma_{Y,i}^2 + \\sigma_{X,i}^2$.

We have $n$ independent observations $z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_n$, where each $z_i$ is drawn from a normal distribution with the common mean $\\mu$ but with a specific, known variance $\\sigma_i^2$, i.e., $z_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma_i^2)$. The likelihood function $L(\\mu)$ for the observations is the product of the individual probability density functions:\n$$L(\\mu | \\{z_i, \\sigma_i^2\\}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_i^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\\right)$$\nThe log-likelihood function $\\ell(\\mu) = \\ln(L(\\mu))$ is:\n$$\\ell(\\mu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma_i^2) - \\frac{(z_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2} \\right)$$\nTo find the MLE $\\hat{\\mu}$, we differentiate $\\ell(\\mu)$ with respect to $\\mu$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{d\\mu} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{z_i - \\mu}{\\sigma_i^2} = 0$$\nSolving for $\\mu$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{z_i}{\\sigma_i^2} = \\mu \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_i^2}$$\n$$\\hat{\\mu}_{MLE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{z_i}{\\sigma_i^2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_i^2}}$$\nThis is the inverse-variance weighted mean.

Substitute the given numerical values to compute the final answer.\n\nStep 1: Probability of Commitment at a Site\nAt any encountered site of class $i \\in \\{S, N\\}$, two competing, independent, memoryless processes occur: eIF1 dissociation (leading to commitment) with rate $k_{\\text{off},i}$, and scanning escape with rate $k_{\\text{leave}}$. This is a classic race between two exponential processes. The time to dissociation, $T_{\\text{off},i}$, follows an exponential distribution with rate $k_{\\text{off},i}$, and the time to escape, $T_{\\text{leave}}$, follows an exponential distribution with rate $k_{\\text{leave}}$. Commitment occurs if $T_{\\text{off},i} < T_{\\text{leave}}$. The probability of this event, which we denote $P_i$, is given by the ratio of the rates:\n$$\nP_i = P(T_{\\text{off},i} < T_{\\text{leave}}) = \\frac{k_{\\text{off},i}}{k_{\\text{off},i} + k_{\\text{leave}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for the dissociation rate, $k_{\\text{off},i} = \\alpha_i/\\tau$:\n$$\nP_i = \\frac{\\alpha_i/\\tau}{\\alpha_i/\\tau + k_{\\text{leave}}} = \\frac{\\alpha_i}{\\alpha_i + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}}\n$$\nThis is the probability that the ribosome commits to initiation upon encountering a single site of class $i$.\n\nStep 2: Derivation of Fidelity $F(\\tau)$\nThe scanning preinitiation complex encounters sites of class $S$ and class $N$ as independent Poisson processes with spatial densities (rates) $\\lambda_S$ and $\\lambda_N$, respectively. A commitment to initiation at an $S$ site can be viewed as a \"thinned\" Poisson process, where an encounter event (rate $\\lambda_S$) is kept only if commitment occurs (probability $P_S$). The effective spatial density of commitment events at $S$ sites is thus $\\lambda'_S = \\lambda_S P_S$. Similarly, the effective density of commitment events at $N$ sites is $\\lambda'_N = \\lambda_N P_N$.\n\nThe fidelity $F(\\tau)$ is the probability that the first commitment event to occur along the 5' UTR is of class $S$. This is equivalent to asking, for two independent competing Poisson processes with rates $\\lambda'_S$ and $\\lambda'_N$, what is the probability that the first event comes from the process with rate $\\lambda'_S$? This probability is given by the ratio of its rate to the total rate:\n$$\nF(\\tau) = \\frac{\\lambda'_S}{\\lambda'_S + \\lambda'_N} = \\frac{\\lambda_S P_S}{\\lambda_S P_S + \\lambda_N P_N}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_S$ and $P_N$:\n$$\nF(\\tau) = \\frac{\\lambda_S \\frac{\\alpha_S}{\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}}}{\\lambda_S \\frac{\\alpha_S}{\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}} + \\lambda_N \\frac{\\alpha_N}{\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}}}\n$$\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})(\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})$:\n$$\nF(\\tau) = \\frac{\\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})}{\\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}) + \\lambda_N \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the fidelity $F(\\tau)$.\n\nStep 3: Derivation of the Sensitivity $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}$\nTo find the sensitivity, we differentiate $F(\\tau)$ with respect to $\\tau$ using the quotient rule, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$. Let:\n$$\nu(\\tau) = \\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})\n$$\n$$\nv(\\tau) = \\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}) + \\lambda_N \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})\n$$\nThe derivatives with respect to $\\tau$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = \\lambda_S \\alpha_S k_{\\text{leave}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = \\lambda_S \\alpha_S k_{\\text{leave}} + \\lambda_N \\alpha_N k_{\\text{leave}} = k_{\\text{leave}}(\\lambda_S \\alpha_S + \\lambda_N \\alpha_N)\n$$\nThe numerator of the derivative $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}$ is $u'v - uv'$. Substituting the expressions for $u, v, u', v'$:\n\\begin{align*}\nu'v - uv' &= (\\lambda_S \\alpha_S k_{\\text{leave}})[\\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}) + \\lambda_N \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})] \\\\\n&\\quad - [\\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})][k_{\\text{leave}}(\\lambda_S \\alpha_S + \\lambda_N \\alpha_N)]\n\\end{align*}\nExpanding and simplifying this expression yields:\n\\begin{align*}\nu'v - uv' &= k_{\\text{leave}} \\lambda_S \\alpha_S [\\lambda_N \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})] - k_{\\text{leave}} \\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}) (\\lambda_N \\alpha_N) \\\\\n&= k_{\\text{leave}} \\lambda_S \\alpha_S \\lambda_N \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}) - k_{\\text{leave}} \\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}) \\lambda_N \\alpha_N \\\\\n&= k_{\\text{leave}} \\lambda_S \\lambda_N \\alpha_S \\alpha_N [(\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}) - (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})] \\\\\n&= k_{\\text{leave}} \\lambda_S \\lambda_N \\alpha_S \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S - \\alpha_N)\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the full derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = \\frac{k_{\\text{leave}} \\lambda_S \\lambda_N \\alpha_S \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S - \\alpha_N)}{[\\lambda_S \\alpha_S (\\alpha_N + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}}) + \\lambda_N \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S + \\tau k_{\\text{leave}})]^2}\n$$\n\nStep 4: Numerical Calculation\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $\\lambda_S = 0.02$, $\\lambda_N = 0.02$\n- $\\alpha_S = 4$, $\\alpha_N = 0.5$\n- $k_{\\text{leave}} = 10\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\tau = 0.10\\,\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the derivative:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = k_{\\text{leave}} \\lambda_S \\lambda_N \\alpha_S \\alpha_N (\\alpha_S - \\alpha_N)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (10) (0.02) (0.02) (4) (0.5) (4 - 0.5) = (10)(0.0004)(2)(3.5) = 0.028\n$$\nNext, calculate the term inside the square brackets in the denominator, evaluated at $\\tau = 0.10\\,\\text{s}$.
