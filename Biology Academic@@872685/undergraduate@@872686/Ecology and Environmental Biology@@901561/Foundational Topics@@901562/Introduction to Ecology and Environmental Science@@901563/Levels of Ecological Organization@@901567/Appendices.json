The student identifies and marks a cohort of 1000 newly germinated seedlings at the beginning of their study (Week 0). They then record the number of marked plants still alive at the start of each subsequent week. The data collected are as follows:\n\n-   Start of Week 0: 1000 individuals\n-   Start of Week 1: 300 individuals\n-   Start of Week 2: 150 individuals\n-   Start of Week 3: 90 individuals\n-   Start of Week 4: 60 individuals\n\nBased on these data, which of the following statements correctly identifies the age-specific mortality rate ($q_x$) for the cohort during its third week of life (the interval from the start of week 2 to the start of week 3) and the type of survivorship curve this population most closely represents?\n\nA.

The mortality rate is $0.40$, and it is a Type III curve.\n\nE. The mortality rate is $0.70$, and it is a Type III curve.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to perform two tasks: first, calculate the age-specific mortality rate ($q_x$) for the specified interval, and second, classify the survivorship curve based on the overall trend in the data.\n\nLet $x$ be the age interval, corresponding to the week number. Let $N_x$ be the number of individuals surviving to the start of age interval $x$. The data provided is:\n$N_0 = 1000$\n$N_1 = 300$\n$N_2 = 150$\n$N_3 = 90$\n$N_4 = 60$\n\nFirst, we calculate the age-specific mortality rate, $q_x$. This rate is defined as the proportion of individuals alive at the start of an age interval $x$ that die during that interval. The formula is $q_x = \\frac{d_x}{N_x}$, where $d_x$ is the number of individuals that die during the interval from $x$ to $x+1$. The number of deaths, $d_x$, is calculated as $d_x = N_x - N_{x+1}$.\n\nThe question asks for the mortality rate during the \"third week of life\". This corresponds to the time interval between the start of Week 2 ($x=2$) and the start of Week 3 ($x=3$). Therefore, we need to calculate $q_2$.\n\nFrom the data, the number of individuals alive at the start of Week 2 is $N_2 = 150$.\nThe number of individuals alive at the start of Week 3 is $N_3 = 90$.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of deaths during this interval, $d_2$:\n$$d_2 = N_2 - N_3 = 150 - 90 = 60$$\nNow, we can calculate the age-specific mortality rate for this interval, $q_2$:\n$$q_2 = \\frac{d_2}{N_2} = \\frac{60}{150}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$q_2 = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.40$$\nSo, the mortality rate during the third week of life is $0.40$.\n\nSecond, we need to determine the type of survivorship curve. Survivorship curves are classified based on the pattern of mortality over an organism's lifespan.\n-   **Type I**: Low mortality in early and middle life, with a sharp increase in mortality in old age. This is typical for species with high parental care, like humans.\n-   **Type II**: A constant mortality rate throughout the lifespan.\n-   **Type III**: Extremely high mortality rates for the young, followed by a flat survivorship rate (low mortality) for the few individuals that survive to a certain age. This is typical for species that produce a large number of offspring with no parental care, like many insects, marine invertebrates, and weedy plants.\n\nLet's examine the mortality pattern of the dandelion cohort.\nIn the first week (from $x=0$ to $x=1$), the number of deaths is $d_0 = N_0 - N_1 = 1000 - 300 = 700$. The mortality rate is $q_0 = \\frac{700}{1000} = 0.7$.\nIn the second week (from $x=1$ to $x=2$), the number of deaths is $d_1 = N_1 - N_2 = 300 - 150 = 150$. The mortality rate is $q_1 = \\frac{150}{300} = 0.5$.\nIn the third week (from $x=2$ to $x=3$), we already calculated $q_2 = 0.40$.\n\nThe data shows a massive loss of individuals in the first week (70% of the cohort died), followed by a progressively lower mortality rate for the survivors. This pattern of very high early-life mortality is the defining characteristic of a Type III survivorship curve.\n\nCombining our findings, the age-specific mortality rate for the third week of life is $0.40$, and the population exhibits a Type III survivorship curve. This corresponds to option D. Let's analyze the other options to confirm they are incorrect.\n-   Option A is incorrect because the curve is Type III, not Type I.\n-   Option B is incorrect because the mortality rate is $0.40$, not $0.60$, and the curve is Type III, not Type II. The value $0.60$ might come from calculating the survival rate during the interval ($N_3/N_2 = 90/150=0.6$).\n-   Option C is incorrect because the mortality rate is $0.40$, not $0.06$. The value $0.06$ might come from an incorrect calculation using the initial cohort size as the denominator ($d_2/N_0 = 60/1000 = 0.06$).\n-   Option E is incorrect because the mortality rate is $0.40$, not $0.70$. The value $0.70$ is the mortality rate for the first week ($q_0$), not the third.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1859790"}, {"introduction": "This final practice synthesizes the concepts of population growth and age structure into a powerful predictive framework.
