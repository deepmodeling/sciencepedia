This exercise explores how a significant change in a lake's depth can alter its mixing regime, transitioning it from a frequently mixed (polymictic) state to one with distinct seasonal stratification (dimictic). By working through this hypothetical scenario, you will apply core principles of physical limnology to predict the ecological consequences of human modifications to aquatic ecosystems [@problem_id:1857874].", "problem": "A shallow, natural lake located in a temperate climate zone is known to be polymictic. This means its waters mix frequently from top to bottom throughout the year, a characteristic maintained because its shallow depth prevents the formation of persistent thermal stratification. The local environmental agency decides to dredge the lake, significantly increasing its average depth to improve recreational boating and create a cold-water fish habitat. The climate is characterized by four distinct seasons; summers are warm enough to heat surface waters well above 4°C, and winters are cold enough for the lake to develop a complete ice cover.\n\nBased on the principles of physical limnology, predict the most likely new mixing regime for this lake after it has been significantly deepened.\n\nA. The lake will remain polymictic, as the increased depth will not be sufficient to overcome the dominant effects of wind mixing in its climate zone.\n\nB. The lake will transition to a dimictic regime, establishing stable thermal stratification in summer and inverse stratification in winter, with full mixing occurring in spring and fall.\n\nC. The lake will transition to a cold monomictic regime, mixing throughout the summer and stratifying only under ice in the winter.\n\nD. The lake will transition to a warm monomictic regime, stratifying in the summer and mixing continuously throughout the fall, winter, and spring.\n\nE. The lake will become meromictic due to the accumulation of dense, anoxic water in the newly deepened basin, preventing complete turnover.", "solution": "The initial state is a shallow, polymictic lake in a temperate climate. Polymixis arises because wind energy and convective cooling can readily overcome the weak thermal stability of a short water column, preventing persistent stratification. After dredging, the average depth increases substantially. The mixing regime is governed by the interplay of wind stirring and buoyancy-driven stability, which depends on the temperature dependence of freshwater density and the lake’s depth.\n\nThe key physical property is that freshwater has a density maximum at $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, i.e., $\\rho(T)$ satisfies $\\frac{d\\rho}{dT}<0$ for $T>4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\frac{d\\rho}{dT}>0$ for $T<4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, with a maximum at $T=4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. In summer, surface heating typically produces $T>4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ at the surface, yielding a stable thermal stratification with warm, light water over colder, denser water. In winter, with ice cover, an inverse stratification forms with near $0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ water at the surface and approximately $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ water at depth.\n\nThe tendency to stratify stably and resist wind mixing increases with depth because the potential energy of stratification increases with the height over which a density gradient is maintained. A commonly used non-dimensional measure of the balance between wind forcing and stratification is the Wedderburn number,\n$$\nW=\\frac{g' h^{2}}{u_{*}^{2} L},\n$$\nwhere $g' = g\\,\\Delta \\rho/\\rho$ is the reduced gravity set by the density contrast $\\Delta \\rho$, $h$ is the mixed-layer depth (scaling with lake depth when fully mixed), $u_{*}$ is the friction velocity set by wind stress, and $L$ is a horizontal length scale (e.g., fetch). For fixed wind forcing and surface buoyancy fluxes, increasing depth increases $h$ and thus increases $W$ as $h^{2}$, making it more likely that wind forcing will tilt rather than fully erode the thermocline, allowing persistent stratification to develop.\n\nGiven the stated climate:\n1. Summers are warm enough to heat surface waters well above $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which favors stable summer stratification once the basin is sufficiently deep to support it.\n2. Winters are cold enough for complete ice cover, which precludes continuous winter mixing and instead produces inverse stratification beneath the ice.\n3. As depth increases, the energy required to fully mix the water column increases, so frequent, complete mixing (polymixis) becomes unlikely relative to the pre-dredging state.\n\nTherefore, after deepening, the most probable regime is dimictic: stable thermal stratification in summer; inverse stratification under ice in winter; full overturn when surface waters cross $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ in spring (warming) and fall (cooling). This matches the canonical pattern for sufficiently deep lakes in temperate climates with warm summers and seasonal ice cover.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely because increased depth raises the stability relative to wind forcing (larger $W$), so persistent stratification can now develop.\n- B is consistent with the physics and the climate description.\n- C (cold monomictic) would require summers that do not warm the lake above $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, contradicting the stated warm summers.\n- D (warm monomictic) requires no winter ice and continuous mixing through winter, contradicting the stated complete ice cover.\n- E (meromictic) can occur with strong permanent density gradients (e.g., from salts) and extreme basin morphometry or wind sheltering; dredging alone, without evidence of solute inputs or extreme morphometry, does not make meromixis the most likely outcome.\n\nHence the most likely new regime is dimictic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1857874"}, {"introduction": "While we can qualitatively describe a stratified lake as having distinct layers, limnologists require precise, quantitative tools to analyze its structure.

This has led to the formation of a saline bottom layer (hypolimnion).
