{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first exercise explores the fundamental interaction between gene flow and genetic drift. Gene flow, through migration, can instantly alter the allele frequencies of a population, while genetic drift determines the long-term, random fate of those alleles. This practice problem models a single migration event to demonstrate a core principle: for a neutral allele in an isolated population, its ultimate probability of becoming fixed is equal to its initial frequency after the migration event [@problem_id:1750117]. Solving this will help you understand how a one-time influx of new genes can reshape the future genetic landscape of a population purely by chance.", "problem": "On the isolated Isla Nublada, a population of 150 lizards exhibits a neutral genetic trait for scale coloration. The 'cerulean' allele, which is responsible for this trait, has an initial frequency of $p_A = 0.25$. A powerful storm carries 30 lizards from the nearby Isla Bruma and deposits them on Isla Nublada. The lizard population on Isla Bruma has a 'cerulean' allele frequency of $p_B = 0.80$. The immigrant lizards successfully integrate and interbreed with the resident population. Assuming the 'cerulean' allele remains neutral and that Isla Nublada remains isolated after this single migration event, what is the ultimate probability that the cerulean allele will become fixed in the island's population? Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the resident population size be $N_{A}=150$ with allele frequency $p_{A}=0.25$, and the immigrant population size be $N_{B}=30$ with allele frequency $p_{B}=0.80$. After a single migration event with complete mixing and no further migration, the initial cerulean allele frequency in the combined population is the ploidy-weighted mean, which for equal ploidy reduces to the individual-number-weighted mean:\n$$\np_{0}=\\frac{N_{A}p_{A}+N_{B}p_{B}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\np_{0}=\\frac{150\\cdot 0.25+30\\cdot 0.80}{150+30}=\\frac{37.5+24}{180}=\\frac{61.5}{180}=\\frac{41}{120}.\n$$\nUnder neutrality in a finite, closed population (Wright–Fisher genetic drift with no selection or further migration), the ultimate fixation probability of an allele equals its current frequency.

This next practice introduces the powerful force of natural selection into the equation. We will examine the case of a single, new, *advantageous* mutation and calculate its probability of fixation [@problem_id:1851050]. This exercise illustrates a crucial concept: positive selection can dramatically increase an allele's chance of spreading through a population, overcoming the randomness of genetic drift. Understanding this interplay between drift and selection is essential for explaining how adaptations arise and spread.", "problem": "On a remote, isolated island, a population of a rare species of flightless beetle, *Insulacolptera ficticius*, is being monitored by conservation biologists. The population is diploid and has maintained a stable effective population size of $N_e = 120$ individuals for many generations. A single new mutation arises spontaneously in one allele of a gene in a single beetle. This mutation is not neutral; it results in a slightly more robust leg structure, which confers a small but consistent survival advantage. The selection coefficient, $s$, which measures the fractional increase in fitness for individuals heterozygous for the mutation, is determined to be $s = 0.015$.\n\nAssuming the population size remains constant and isolated, what is the probability that this single advantageous mutation will eventually spread through the entire population and become fixed (i.e., reach a frequency of 100%)?

In nature, many populations are not fully isolated but are connected by a trickle of ongoing gene flow, while genetic drift continuously works to make them diverge. This problem introduces the Fixation Index, $F_{ST}$, a key metric that quantifies the genetic differentiation between populations [@problem_id:1750099]. By assuming a state of equilibrium, you will learn how to use an observable genetic statistic ($F_{ST}$) to estimate a crucial, and often hidden, ecological parameter: the effective number of migrants per generation ($N_e m$).

A team of conservation geneticists is studying the level of connectivity between these two populations, which is presumed to occur via wind-dispersed pollen.
