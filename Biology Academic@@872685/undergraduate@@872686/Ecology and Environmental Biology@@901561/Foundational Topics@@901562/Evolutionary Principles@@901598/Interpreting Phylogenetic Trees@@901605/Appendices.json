This exercise demonstrates how a molecular phylogeny can be used to identify cryptic species—organisms that are morphologically identical but represent distinct evolutionary lineages. Mastering this application is fundamental for modern ecology and conservation, as an accurate species count is the essential first step toward understanding and protecting ecosystems [@problem_id:1855693].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying fireflies of the genus *Photinus* within the confines of a single, isolated nature preserve. All fireflies captured in the preserve appear morphologically identical, leading to the initial hypothesis that they represent a single species. To test for the presence of cryptic species (genetically distinct species that look alike), the ecologist collects ten individual fireflies, labeled F1 through F10. A specific segment of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is sequenced for each of these ten individuals.\n\nA phylogenetic analysis is then performed, which reconstructs the evolutionary relationships among these ten individuals. The analysis also includes DNA sequences from three well-documented reference species of *Photinus* that were collected from different continents: *Photinus nova*, *Photinus obscurus*, and *Photinus umbra*. The resulting evolutionary tree, which is a branching diagram that depicts ancestor-descendant relationships, is described by the following topology:\n\n1.  The individuals F1, F5, and F9 form an exclusive group with the reference species *Photinus nova*.\n2.  The individuals F2, F4, F6, and F10 form an exclusive group with the reference species *Photinus obscurus*.\n3.  The individuals F3, F7, and F8 form an exclusive group with the reference species *Photinus umbra*.\n4.  The evolutionary group containing *Photinus nova* and its associated individuals is more closely related to the group containing *Photinus obscurus* and its individuals than either is to the group containing *Photinus umbra*.\n\nIf we define a \"distinct evolutionary lineage\" in the preserve as a unique group of sampled individuals that cluster with one of the distinct reference species, how many distinct *Photinus* evolutionary lineages were found in the sample of ten fireflies from the preserve?", "solution": "Define the set of distinct reference species as $R=\\{\\textit{P. nova},\\ \\textit{P. obscurus},\\ \\textit{P. umbra}\\}$. For each $r\\in R$, let $S_{r}$ denote the subset of sampled individuals $\\{F1,\\ldots,F10\\}$ that cluster exclusively with $r$ in the phylogenetic tree. By the problem statement:\n- $S_{\\textit{P. nova}}=\\{F1,F5,F9\\}$,\n- $S_{\\textit{P. obscurus}}=\\{F2,F4,F6,F10\\}$,\n- $S_{\\textit{P. umbra}}=\\{F3,F7,F8\\}$.\n\nThe problem defines a \"distinct evolutionary lineage\" in the preserve as a unique group of sampled individuals that clusters with one of the distinct reference species. Therefore, the number of distinct lineages is the number of reference species $r\\in R$ for which $|S_{r}|0$.\n\nCompute the cardinalities: $|S_{\\textit{P. nova}}|=3$, $|S_{\\textit{P. obscurus}}|=4$, and $|S_{\\textit{P. umbra}}|=3$. Since all are positive, the count of distinct lineages is\n$$\nL=\\left|\\{r\\in R:\\ |S_{r}|0\\}\\right|=3.\n$$\nThe additional information that the $\\textit{P. nova}$ group is more closely related to the $\\textit{P. obscurus}$ group than either is to the $\\textit{P. umbra}$ group does not change $L$, because the definition of a lineage here is tied to clustering with each distinct reference species, not to relationships among those species-level clades.\n\nHence, there are $3$ distinct evolutionary lineages among the ten sampled fireflies in the preserve.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1855693"}, {"introduction": "An evolutionary tree provides a roadmap for tracing the history of biological traits, from simple metabolic pathways to complex structures. This practice challenges you to use a phylogeny to investigate the evolution of carnivory in plants, applying the principle of parsimony to distinguish between traits shared due to common ancestry (homology) and those that evolved independently (convergence). This skill is a cornerstone of comparative biology, enabling us to test hypotheses about how and why organisms adapt to their environments [@problem_id:1855711].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the relationships among a group of five newly discovered plant species. Through genetic sequencing, the following evolutionary relationships have been established:\n\nThe group can be divided into two primary lineages, Lineage 1 and Lineage 2, which diverged from a single common ancestor.\n- Lineage 1 consists of three species: *Folium poculum*, *Corolla adhaerens*, and *Stipes glutinosus*. Within this lineage, *Corolla adhaerens* and *Stipes glutinosus* are more closely related to each other than either is to *Folium poculum*.\n- Lineage 2 consists of two species, *Petalus amphora* and *Radix nonvorax*, which are sister species.\n\nThe biologist also observes that some of these species are carnivorous, exhibiting one of two distinct trapping mechanisms:\n- **Flypaper trap**: The leaves are covered in sticky glandular hairs that ensnare insects. This is observed in *Corolla adhaerens* and *Stipes glutinosus*.\n- **Pitcher trap**: The leaves are modified into a deep, pitfall-like cavity filled with digestive fluid. This is observed in *Folium poculum* and *Petalus amphora*.\n\nThe species *Radix nonvorax* is not carnivorous.\n\nBased on these phylogenetic relationships and trait distributions, which of the following statements presents the most likely evolutionary history for these trapping mechanisms, assuming the principle of parsimony (the simplest explanation with the fewest evolutionary events)?\n\nA. The pitcher trap is a homologous trait, while the flypaper trap is the result of convergent evolution.\n\nB. The flypaper trap is a homologous trait, while the pitcher trap is the result of convergent evolution.\n\nC. Both the pitcher trap and the flypaper trap are homologous traits.\n\nD. Both the pitcher trap and the flypaper trap are the result of convergent evolution.\n\nE. All observed carnivorous traits evolved from a single carnivorous common ancestor for all five species, followed by a loss of carnivory in *Radix nonvorax*.", "solution": "We first encode the phylogeny described. The five species form two primary clades: Lineage 1 with topology $((\\textit{Corolla adhaerens},\\textit{Stipes glutinosus}),\\textit{Folium poculum})$ and Lineage 2 with topology $(\\textit{Petalus amphora},\\textit{Radix nonvorax})$. Thus the whole tree is a root splitting into these two clades.\n\nWe then map the two trapping mechanisms onto this fixed tree. Observed states:\n- Flypaper trap present in $\\textit{Corolla adhaerens}$ and $\\textit{Stipes glutinosus}$; absent in $\\textit{Folium poculum}$, $\\textit{Petalus amphora}$, and $\\textit{Radix nonvorax}$.\n- Pitcher trap present in $\\textit{Folium poculum}$ and $\\textit{Petalus amphora}$; absent in $\\textit{Corolla adhaerens}$, $\\textit{Stipes glutinosus}$, and $\\textit{Radix nonvorax}$.\n- $\\textit{Radix nonvorax}$ is non-carnivorous.\n\nApply parsimony, counting the minimal number of evolutionary changes (gains or losses) required for each character on the given tree.\n\nFor the flypaper trap (binary character: presence versus absence):\n- Presence occurs in exactly the two sister taxa $\\textit{Corolla adhaerens}$ and $\\textit{Stipes glutinosus}$. The most parsimonious reconstruction is a single gain on their shared ancestral branch.\n- Therefore the minimal number of changes for flypaper is $1$.\n- Any scenario invoking convergence of flypaper between these two sister taxa would require $2$ independent gains, which is less parsimonious.\n\nFor the pitcher trap (binary character: presence versus absence):\n- Presence occurs in $\\textit{Folium poculum}$ in Lineage 1 and $\\textit{Petalus amphora}$ in Lineage 2; it is absent from their respective sister lineages. On the fixed tree, the minimal number of steps to explain two separated presences is $2$. This can be realized as two independent gains (one in each lineage) with $0$ losses, or equivalently as a single ancestral presence with $2$ losses; both cost $2$ changes on the tree.\n- Hence, parsimony does not force a unique choice between “homologous” versus “convergent” for the pitcher trap based on step count alone; however, explaining two occurrences in non-sister lineages by two independent origins is the standard parsimonious interpretation that avoids positing an unobserved ancestral pitcher state plus multiple losses.\n\nNow evaluate the options by total event counts and logical consistency:\n- A (pitcher homologous, flypaper convergent): flypaper convergence requires $2$ gains; pitcher can be fit with $2$ changes. Total changes are at least $2+2=4$, which is less parsimonious than using a single flypaper origin.\n- B (flypaper homologous, pitcher convergent): flypaper requires $1$ change; pitcher requires $2$ changes as independent origins. Total $1+2=3$.\n- C (both homologous): flypaper homologous requires $1$ change; pitcher homologous requires $2$ changes (via losses). Total also $1+2=3$. Although equal in step count to B, it posits an ancestral pitcher state and multiple losses despite the trait being split across distant lineages, which is not the usual parsimonious interpretation for such a distribution.\n- D (both convergent): flypaper convergent requires $2$ gains; pitcher convergent requires $2$ gains. Total $2+2=4$, less parsimonious.\n- E (single carnivorous ancestor with later loss in $\\textit{Radix nonvorax}$): this asserts a single origin of carnivory for all five species and only specifies a loss in $\\textit{Radix nonvorax}$. It does not explicitly account for the necessary change in mechanism between flypaper and pitcher; when the mechanisms are treated as distinct characters, the minimal reconstruction still requires the $1$ event for flypaper and $2$ for pitcher as above. Thus E is not the most parsimonious statement under the specified trait coding.\n\nTherefore, the most parsimonious clearly stated option is that the flypaper trap is homologous within the $\\textit{Corolla adhaerens}$–$\\textit{Stipes glutinosus}$ clade, and the pitcher trap arose convergently in $\\textit{Folium poculum}$ and $\\textit{Petalus amphora}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1855711"}, {"introduction": "As we sequence entire genomes, we can build evolutionary trees from thousands of different genes. However, these individual gene trees often tell conflicting stories. This advanced problem delves into the fascinating biological reasons for such discordance, introducing the concept of Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS) as an explanation. Understanding ILS is essential for navigating the complexities of modern phylogenomics and shows how apparent contradictions in the data can actually reveal deep insights into the speciation process, particularly during periods of rapid diversification [@problem_id:1855699].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a rapid adaptive radiation in a newly discovered genus of tropical songbirds, *Helianthis*. Based on a comprehensive analysis of morphology and a consensus tree from over 1000 nuclear genes, the species-level phylogeny is robustly established. The topology indicates that *Helianthis aurorus* and *Helianthis croceus* are sister species. This pair, in turn, is the sister group to *Helianthis flammeus*. A more distantly related species, *Umbrornis umbra*, is used as the outgroup. The time between the speciation event that separated the ancestor of (*H. aurorus*, *H. croceus*, *H. flammeus*) from the ancestor of *U. umbra* was substantial. However, the time between the divergence of *H. flammeus* and the subsequent divergence of *H. aurorus* and *H. croceus* is known to be exceptionally short.\n\nTo further investigate the diversification, the researcher sequences three unlinked, autosomal gene loci—`locus_1`, `locus_2`, and `locus_3`—which are presumed to be evolving neutrally. Phylogenetic analysis of these loci yields the following results, with all described relationships having high statistical support (bootstrap values  95%):\n\n-   **`locus_1`:** The gene tree derived from this locus is perfectly congruent with the species tree. It shows *H. aurorus* and *H. croceus* as sister taxa, with *H. flammeus* as the sister to that pair.\n-   **`locus_2`:** The gene tree from this locus shows a conflicting topology where *H. croceus* and *H. flammeus* are sister taxa. *H. aurorus* is the sister to this (*H. croceus*, *H. flammeus*) pair.\n-   **`locus_3`:** The gene tree from this locus shows yet another conflicting topology where *H. aurorus* and *H. flammeus* are sister taxa. *H. croceus* is the sister to this (*H. aurorus*, *H. flammeus*) pair.\n\nGiven these observations, which of the following statements provides the most likely and parsimonious evolutionary explanation for the discordance among the gene trees and the species tree?\n\nA. The exceptionally short time interval between the two successive speciation events within the *Helianthis* genus allowed ancestral genetic polymorphisms to persist. The random sorting of these ancient alleles into the descendant species lineages resulted in some gene histories that do not match the species' branching history.\n\nB. Post-speciation hybridization occurred repeatedly. Specifically, gene flow between *H. croceus* and *H. flammeus* explains the `locus_2` tree, while separate gene flow between *H. aurorus* and *H. flammeus* explains the `locus_3` tree.\n\nC. The `locus_2` and `locus_3` genes were under strong convergent selective pressure in different pairs of species due to similar ecological pressures, causing their sequences to become artificially similar and thus creating misleading phylogenetic signals.\n\nD. The phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms are known to perform poorly when branch lengths are very short. The conflicting topologies are likely computational artifacts with low reliability, despite the high bootstrap values.\n\nE. Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) mediated by a retrovirus occurred after the species radiation. One viral event transferred `locus_2` between *H. croceus* and *H. flammeus*, and a second, independent event transferred `locus_3` between *H. aurorus* and *H. flammeus*.", "solution": "We first restate the species relationships. The robust species tree is $((H.\\,\\text{aurorus},\\,H.\\,\\text{croceus}),\\,H.\\,\\text{flammeus})$ with $U.\\,\\text{umbra}$ as the outgroup. The divergence between the *Helianthis* clade and the outgroup is long, whereas the internal branch between the split of $H.\\,\\text{flammeus}$ and the subsequent split of $H.\\,\\text{aurorus}$ and $H.\\,\\text{croceus}$ is exceptionally short.\n\nUnder the multispecies coalescent for three ingroup taxa with species tree $((A,B),C)$, let the length of the internal branch be $t$ generations and the effective population size of the ancestral population on that branch be $N_{e}$. In coalescent units, define $\\tau = \\frac{t}{2N_{e}}$. The probabilities of gene tree topologies are:\n$$\nP_{\\text{match}} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\exp(-\\tau),\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\text{discordant}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{3}\\exp(-\\tau), \\quad\nP_{\\text{discordant}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}\\exp(-\\tau).\n$$\nWhen the internode is exceptionally short, $\\tau$ is small, so $\\exp(-\\tau)$ is close to $1$, yielding $P_{\\text{match}} \\approx \\frac{1}{3}$ and each discordant topology also $\\approx \\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, with a small sample of unlinked, neutrally evolving loci, it is entirely expected that one locus matches the species tree while the other two each show one of the two alternative, strongly supported discordant topologies. This pattern is the hallmark of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), also called deep coalescence, caused by the persistence and random sorting of ancestral polymorphisms across a short internode.\n\nWe evaluate alternatives:\n- Post-speciation hybridization (option B) would require at least two independent introgression events affecting different unlinked loci in different directions, which is less parsimonious than a single population-genetic cause and is not specifically indicated by the data. The observed symmetric pattern across the two discordant topologies is the generic expectation under ILS when $\\tau$ is small.\n- Convergent selection (option C) conflicts with the assumption that the loci are neutrally evolving and is implausible as a mechanism to drive whole-locus sequence convergence strong enough to yield high-support, fully resolved but conflicting gene trees in two different species pairs.\n- Algorithmic artifact (option D) is inconsistent with the high and consistent support across loci for different, mutually exclusive resolutions; high support combined with replication across loci indicates true biological discordance rather than computational failure.\n- Horizontal gene transfer (option E) of autosomal nuclear genes between bird species via retroviruses, in two independent events targeting two different loci, is extremely unlikely and unparsimonious.\n\nThus, the most likely and parsimonious explanation is incomplete lineage sorting due to the exceptionally short internode, as in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1855699"}]}
