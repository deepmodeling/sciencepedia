{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin, we will practice applying the core definitions of foundation species and ecosystem engineers. This first exercise presents a hypothetical scenario involving a newly discovered organism, challenging you to classify its ecological role based on its observed impacts. Mastering this skill is crucial for accurately describing how species structure their communities and for distinguishing between different types of high-impact species [@problem_id:1850333].", "problem": "An ecological research team discovers a novel species of microfungus, *Arenaria stabilis*, living in the loose sand dunes of a previously barren desert region. Through field observation and laboratory analysis, they determine its primary ecological function. The fungus secretes a complex glycoprotein that binds individual sand grains together. Over large areas, this process transforms the unstable, shifting sand into a cohesive and stable \"biological soil crust.\" This crust significantly reduces wind erosion and increases water retention in the top layer of the sand. The team observes that this new stability allows for the colonization of several species that were absent before: hardy desert grasses can now anchor their roots, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria colonize the crust's surface, and the increased cover and moisture provide a habitat for various small insects and burrowing arthropods which, in turn, support a small population of insectivorous lizards. The fungal network itself constitutes a significant portion of the biomass in this newly formed community.\n\nBased on the ecological role and effects described, which of the following classifications most accurately describes *Arenaria stabilis*?\n\nA. Keystone species\n\nB. Indicator species\n\nC. Ecosystem engineer\n\nD. Foundation species\n\nE. Both a keystone species and an ecosystem engineer\n\nF. Both an ecosystem engineer and a foundation species", "solution": "We begin by defining the relevant ecological categories and mapping the described traits of the fungus to those definitions.\n\nAn ecosystem engineer is an organism that directly or indirectly modifies the physical environment, thereby altering the availability of resources to other species and creating or maintaining habitat. The fungus secretes a glycoprotein that binds sand grains, forming a cohesive biological soil crust. This physical modification stabilizes the substrate, reduces wind erosion, and increases water retention. These changes in abiotic conditions facilitate the establishment of grasses, cyanobacteria, insects, arthropods, and lizards. Therefore, the fungus clearly functions as an ecosystem engineer by transforming an unstable sandy matrix into a structured habitat that supports a broader community.\n\nA foundation species is typically abundant and contributes a large proportion of community biomass, exerting strong community-structuring effects by creating or maintaining habitat. The problem states that the fungal network constitutes a significant portion of the biomass and that its activity creates the stable substrate on which the community depends. This matches the foundation species concept (analogous to corals in reefs or kelps in kelp forests), as the fungus’s presence and abundance establish the physical and biological foundation of the community.\n\nA keystone species exerts effects on community structure that are large relative to its biomass or abundance. Here, the fungus is not described as rare or low in biomass; instead, it is abundant and constitutes significant biomass. Thus, while its effects are large, they are not disproportionate to its abundance, making the keystone classification less appropriate.\n\nAn indicator species is primarily used to signal particular environmental conditions, stressors, or changes. The description does not emphasize such a role; rather, it focuses on habitat modification and community formation.\n\nGiven these mappings, the most accurate classification is that the fungus is both an ecosystem engineer and a foundation species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{F}$$", "id": "1850333"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic definitions, this next practice challenges you to dissect the complex role of a single organism. Corals are classic examples of species that are both foundation species and ecosystem engineers, but these two functions operate through different mechanisms. By comparing the communities on a living coral to a dead skeleton, you can learn to separate the ecological effects derived from the organism's biological activity from those provided by its persistent physical structure [@problem_id:1850325].", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the distinct ecological roles of corals on a reef. To do this, they identify two coral heads of the same species, *Pocillopora damicornis*. Both heads have an identical, complex branching morphology, with a total volume of 2000 cm³ and a surface area of 1.5 m². One coral head, designated `L`, is healthy and living. The other, designated `D`, has recently died from a non-contagious stress event, leaving its calcium carbonate skeleton perfectly intact but devoid of living tissue.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, consider the following ecological effects:\n1.  **Foundation Species Effects (Living Tissue Dependent):** These arise from the biological processes of the living coral. They include the secretion of mucus which serves as a food source for certain invertebrates (mucivores), active defense against predation and fouling via stinging cells (nematocysts), and the maintenance of a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae.\n2.  **Ecosystem Engineering Effects (Structure Dependent):** These arise from the physical structure created by the coral's skeleton. They include the provision of three-dimensional habitat, which acts as a refuge from predators and high water flow for a wide range of mobile invertebrates. This structural effect is identical for both `L` and `D`.\n\nThe ecologist plans to survey the invertebrate communities on both coral heads after a period of three months. Based on the principles of foundation species and ecosystem engineering, which of the following predictions about the invertebrate communities are correct? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Invertebrate species that are obligate mucivores (i.e., they feed exclusively on coral mucus) will be present on `L` but largely absent from `D`.\n\nB. The species composition on `L` and `D` will be nearly identical, as the physical structure is the primary determinant of community assembly.\n\nC. Invertebrate species that specialize in consuming turf algae (herbivores) will be significantly more abundant on `D` than on `L`.\n\nD. Bioeroding invertebrates, such as boring sponges and bivalves that burrow into calcium carbonate, will be more prevalent and active on `D` than on `L`.\n\nE. For invertebrate species that exclusively use the coral's branches for physical shelter from predators and do not interact with the coral tissue, their population densities are expected to be similar between `L` and `D`.\n\nF. The total species richness of invertebrates will be identical on both `L` and `D` because the available surface area for colonization is the same.", "solution": "We are asked to predict differences in invertebrate communities between two coral heads of the same species and identical structure: $L$ is living, $D$ is recently dead. The key principles specified are:\n- Foundation species effects depend on living tissue and include mucus secretion (a food resource), active defense via nematocysts (which inhibit fouling, predation, and some settlement), and maintenance of symbiosis with zooxanthellae (which supports living tissue and suppresses algal overgrowth). These effects occur only on $L$.\n- Ecosystem engineering effects depend on physical structure and include provision of three-dimensional habitat/shelter. These effects are identical for $L$ and $D$ because the skeletons have the same morphology, volume, and surface area.\n\nUsing these principles:\n\n1. For obligate mucivores: On $L$, mucus is produced continuously by living tissue and thus provides a food resource. On $D$, there is no living tissue and hence no mucus production. Therefore, obligate mucivores should be present on $L$ and largely absent on $D$. This supports A as correct.\n\n2. For overall species composition: Although structure is identical, the presence of living tissue on $L$ both adds unique resources (mucus) and imposes biotic filters (nematocysts, tissue overgrowth) that alter colonization and persistence relative to $D$. Consequently, community composition should differ, not be nearly identical. Therefore B is incorrect.\n\n3. For turf algae herbivores: On $D$, the dead skeleton is rapidly colonized by turf algae in the absence of living coral tissue, creating abundant algal resources. On $L$, tissue and associated defenses suppress algal settlement and overgrowth. Thus herbivorous invertebrates specializing on turf algae should be significantly more abundant on $D$. Therefore C is correct.\n\n4. For bioeroders: Bioeroding invertebrates that bore into calcium carbonate require access to skeletal material. On $L$, living tissue covers and protects the skeleton, inhibiting borers and often outgrowing or deterring them. On $D$, skeletal surfaces are exposed and thus more susceptible to bioerosion. Therefore D is correct.\n\n5. For invertebrates using only physical shelter: By definition, species that exclusively use the branching structure for refuge and do not interact with living tissue should be governed by the ecosystem engineering effect. Since the physical structure, volume, and surface area are identical, their population densities are expected to be similar between $L$ and $D$. Therefore E is correct.\n\n6. For total species richness: Equal surface area does not guarantee equal richness because living tissue on $L$ both creates unique niches (e.g., for mucivores) and excludes or suppresses other colonizers (e.g., turf algae, some fouling organisms, some bioeroders), while $D$ opens niches for algal-associated fauna and borers. Net richness need not be identical and is expected to differ. Therefore F is incorrect.\n\nCollecting the correct statements, the valid options are A, C, D, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDE}$$", "id": "1850325"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we will transition from conceptual classification to quantitative prediction. This problem provides a mathematical model to explore the dynamic interplay between a soil-stabilizing foundation species and a soil-disturbing ecosystem engineer. By working through this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience using models to calculate the net effect of opposing ecological forces and predict how ecosystem properties respond to changes in species populations [@problem_id:1850336].", "problem": "In an alpine meadow ecosystem, the rate of soil erosion is controlled by the interplay between a dominant foundation species and a key ecosystem engineer. The foundation species is a deep-rooted tussock grass that stabilizes the soil. The baseline erosion rate for bare soil in this ecosystem is $E_0 = 150.0$ tonnes per hectare per year. The presence of the grass, with a fractional ground cover $C_g$ (where $0 \\leq C_g \\leq 1$), reduces this erosion rate. The ecosystem engineer is a species of fossorial mammal, the \"alpine marmotole,\" whose burrowing activity (bioturbation) disrupts the soil and increases erosion.\n\nA model has been developed to describe the net soil erosion rate, $E_{net}$, in this system. The model combines the stabilizing effect of the grass and the disruptive effect of the marmotoles. The net erosion rate, in tonnes per hectare per year, is given by:\n$$E_{net} = E_0 \\exp(-\\alpha C_g) + \\beta D_m$$\nwhere:\n- $D_m$ is the population density of marmotoles, in animals per hectare.\n- $\\alpha = 4.50$ is a dimensionless parameter representing the soil stabilization efficiency of the grass.\n- $\\beta = 2.50 \\frac{\\text{tonnes}}{\\text{animal} \\cdot \\text{year}}$ is the bioturbation coefficient, representing the erosion increase per unit density of marmotoles.\n\nFurthermore, the marmotoles directly affect the grass cover through grazing and soil disturbance. The grass cover, $C_g$, is found to decrease linearly with increasing marmotole density according to the relationship:\n$$C_g = C_{g,0} - \\gamma D_m$$\nwhere:\n- $C_{g,0} = 0.85$ is the grass cover in the absence of marmotoles.\n- $\\gamma = 0.012$ hectare per animal is the coefficient representing the impact of a single marmotole on the grass cover.\n\nInitially, a stable population of marmotoles is present at a density $D_{m, \\text{initial}} = 10.0$ animals per hectare.
