This material is known as Coarse Particulate Organic Matter (CPOM). The breakdown of CPOM is a critical process, and it occurs through two main pathways. The first is a baseline process of leaching and microbial decomposition, which occurs at a rate directly proportional to the mass of CPOM present. The second pathway involves consumption by a group of aquatic invertebrates known as \"shredders\" (e.g., certain species of caddisfly and stonefly larvae), which break down the large leaf fragments. The rate of CPOM consumption by shredders is also directly proportional to the mass of CPOM present.\n\nAn ecologist sets up an experiment in two identical, isolated stream channels, A and B. Channel A represents a natural, healthy stream with a stable population of shredders. Channel B is an experimental channel from which all shredder invertebrates have been carefully removed.\n\nAt the start of the experiment (time $t=0$), a single pulse of leaves, representing an initial mass $M_0$ of CPOM, is added to each channel. The breakdown process is then monitored.
