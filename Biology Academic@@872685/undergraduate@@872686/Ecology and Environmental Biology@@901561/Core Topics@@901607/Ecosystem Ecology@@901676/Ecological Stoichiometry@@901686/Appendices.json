This practice delves into the critical role of microbes in decomposition, exploring the threshold that determines whether they release nutrients (mineralization) or consume them from the environment (immobilization).

The dominant decomposer microbial community in the soil has a relatively constant biomass stoichiometry, with a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) of 8.0:1.

The efficiency with which the microbes convert consumed carbon into new microbial biomass is defined as the Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE). For this particular community, the CUE is 0.45.\n\nWhen the leaf litter provides more nitrogen than the microbes need for their growth, they release the excess inorganic nitrogen into the soil, making it available to plants. Conversely, if the litter is nitrogen-poor, the microbes must draw inorganic nitrogen from the surrounding soil to meet their stoichiometric needs. There exists a critical C:N ratio for the leaf litter at which the nitrogen provided by the litter exactly matches the microbial demand, resulting in no net exchange of inorganic nitrogen with the soil.\n\nCalculate this critical C:N ratio for the leaf litter.
