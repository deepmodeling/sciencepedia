A key metric for this process is the total spiraling length ($S$), which represents the average downstream distance a nutrient atom travels to complete one full cycle of being in the water column and being part of the biota. The total spiraling length is composed of two components: the uptake length ($S_w$) and the turnover length ($S_p$). The uptake length is the average distance a nutrient atom travels downstream in the water column before it is taken up by an organism. The turnover length is the average distance the nutrient atom travels downstream while it is incorporated within an organism, before being released back into the water.\n\nAn ecological research team is studying nitrogen cycling in a small forest stream.

The stream's morphology consists of repeating sequences of two distinct habitat types: riffles and pools. The ecologist aims to determine the characteristic nutrient spiraling length for a long reach of the stream.\n\nThe key component of spiraling length is the uptake length, $S_w$, which is the average distance a dissolved nutrient molecule travels downstream before being taken up by the benthos. Within a uniform stream segment, the uptake length is given by the relationship $S_w = \\frac{v \\cdot h}{k_L}$, where $v$ is the average water velocity, $h$ is the average water depth, and $k_L$ is the nutrient mass transfer coefficient, which represents the efficiency of nutrient uptake from the water column. For the purpose of this problem, assume the turnover length (the distance a nutrient travels as part of an organism) is negligible, so the total spiraling length is equal to the uptake length.\n\nThe stream's characteristics for each habitat are as follows:\n- **Riffle sections**: average length $L_r = 15$ m, water velocity $v_r = 0.60$ m/s, water depth $h_r = 0.25$ m, and mass transfer coefficient $k_{L,r} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}$ m/s.\n- **Pool sections**: average length $L_p = 25$ m, water velocity $v_p = 0.10$ m/s, water depth $h_p = 0.80$ m, and mass transfer coefficient $k_{L,p} = 0.50 \\times 10^{-4}$ m/s.\n\nA junior researcher, tasked with a quick assessment, measures the parameters only within a typical riffle and calculates the uptake length based solely on these riffle characteristics. This value represents a localized, single-habitat estimate. To obtain a more accurate representation of the entire stream, one must calculate a reach-averaged uptake length. The reach-averaged uptake *rate* per meter is the length-weighted average of the uptake rates per meter of the individual habitats. The uptake rate per meter is the reciprocal of the uptake length ($1/S_w$).\n\nCalculate the absolute difference between the researcher's riffle-only estimate of the uptake length and the more accurate reach-averaged uptake length.

A shorter spiraling length generally signifies a more efficient ecosystem that can rapidly take up and retain nutrients. This final exercise applies the concept of spiraling to a comparative study, demonstrating how ecologists can use metrics of resistance and resilience, derived from spiraling length data, to quantify how well different streams—such as a degraded channel versus a restored one—cope with and recover from nutrient pollution.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the stability of two stream ecosystems in response to nutrient pollution. Stream A is a straightened, channelized agricultural channel, while Stream B is a nearby, physically similar stream that has undergone extensive restoration to reintroduce meanders and complex habitats. The ecologist uses nutrient spiraling length, denoted by $S$, as a key indicator of ecosystem function. Spiraling length is the average downstream distance a nutrient atom travels to complete one cycle of biological uptake, transformation, and release. A shorter spiraling length indicates more efficient nutrient retention by the ecosystem.\n\nThe experiment consists of three phases. First, the baseline spiraling length ($S_{base}$) is measured in each stream. Second, a chronic disturbance is simulated by adding a constant, low-level source of phosphate upstream for an extended period, allowing each stream to reach a new, stable, and longer spiraling length ($S_{dist}$). Third, the phosphate source is removed, and the recovery of the spiraling length is monitored.\n\nThe post-disturbance recovery of the spiraling length $S(t)$ at time $t$ after the removal of the source is modeled by the equation:\n$$S(t) - S_{base} = (S_{dist} - S_{base}) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the characteristic recovery time for the stream.\n\nTo quantify and compare the stability of the two streams, the ecologist uses the following metrics:\n1.  **Resistance ($\\mathcal{R}$)**: A dimensionless measure of the system's ability to resist change, defined as $\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{S_{base}}{|S_{dist} - S_{base}|}$.\n2.  **Resilience ($\\mathcal{L}$)**: A measure of the system's recovery rate, defined as $\\mathcal{L} = 1/\\tau$.\n3.  **Stability Index ($\\mathcal{I}$)**: A dimensionless composite metric that combines resistance and resilience, defined as $\\mathcal{I} = t_1 \\cdot \\mathcal{R} \\cdot \\mathcal{L}$, where $t_1$ is a specific reference time at which a recovery measurement is taken.\n\nThe experimental data collected are as follows:\n-   **Stream A (Channelized):**\n    -   Baseline spiraling length: $S_{A, base} = 150.0$ m\n    -   Disturbed spiraling length: $S_{A, dist} = 450.0$ m\n-   **Stream B (Restored):**\n    -   Baseline spiraling length: $S_{B, base} = 50.0$ m\n    -   Disturbed spiraling length: $S_{B, dist} = 80.0$ m\n\nAt a time $t_1 = 30.0$ days after the disturbance was removed, the measured spiraling lengths were $S_{A}(t_1) = 250.0$ m and $S_{B}(t_1) = 55.0$ m.\n\nBased on these data, calculate the ratio of the Stability Index of the restored stream to that of the channelized stream, $\\frac{\\mathcal{I}_B}{\\mathcal{I}_A}$.
