{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Intrasexual selection is often visualized as males physically competing for access to females, but its scope is much broader. Competition can be indirect, involving contests over resources that are essential for attracting mates. This exercise [@problem_id:1855959] challenges you to apply the core definition of intrasexual selection to a non-traditional scenario involving a species with reversed sex roles, forcing a deeper consideration of what constitutes a \"limiting resource\" in reproduction.", "problem": "In the ecology of the fictional bird species, the Crimson-Throated Sun-Gazer (*Heliornis coccinus*), a peculiar reproductive strategy has been observed. The species is polyandrous, where a female may mate with multiple males in a season. However, males are the sole providers of parental care, incubating the eggs and feeding the nestlings exclusively with nectar from a specific flowering plant. The abundance of this plant varies significantly across different territories.\n\nBefore the breeding season begins, females engage in intense, often aggressive, competition with other females to establish and defend these territories. A female's ability to secure a territory rich in nectar-producing plants is the primary determinant of how many males she can attract to mate with and lay eggs for, as males will only associate with females who control a viable territory.\n\nBased on this scenario, how would an evolutionary biologist most accurately categorize the observed competition among the female Crimson-Throated Sun-Gazers for food-rich territories?\n\nA. Intersexual selection, because the choice of territory by a female is a form of mate choice.\n\nB. Natural selection, because the competition is primarily for a food resource essential for offspring survival, not directly for mates.\n\nC. Intrasexual selection, because a limiting resource (territory) directly controls access to mates, leading to competition within one sex.\n\nD. Kin selection, because females may be indirectly helping related individuals by defending a large territory.\n\nE. Stabilizing selection, because it favors intermediate-sized territories over extremely small or large ones.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the definitions relevant to evolutionary mechanisms:\n- Sexual selection is the component of natural selection that arises from variance in mating success.\n- Intrasexual selection refers to competition among individuals of the same sex for access to mates, which can be mediated directly (fighting) or indirectly via control of resources that grant access to mates.\n- Intersexual selection refers to mate choice, where individuals of one sex prefer certain traits in the other sex.\n- Kin selection involves traits that increase the reproductive success of relatives, weighted by relatedness.\n- Stabilizing selection favors intermediate phenotypes over extremes in a continuous trait distribution.\n\nIn the scenario, key observations are:\n1. The species is polyandrous and males provide exclusive parental care. This commonly leads to a sex-role reversal in which females compete for access to mates and males are choosier, because male parental investment is high and thus males become the limiting reproductive resource.\n2. Males associate only with females who control a viable, nectar-rich territory. Therefore, a female’s control of a high-quality territory directly determines her mating success, i.e., how many males she can attract.\n3. Females engage in aggressive competition with other females to secure and defend such territories before breeding.\n\nFrom these observations, the competition among females for food-rich territories is best classified as intrasexual selection: females of the same sex compete over a limiting resource (territory quality) that directly controls access to mates. Although the proximate object of competition is a resource (nectar plants), the ultimate fitness currency being competed over is mating opportunities, as explicitly stated by the link between territory quality and the number of males attracted.\n\nWhy the other options are not the best classification:\n- Option A (Intersexual selection) focuses on mate choice. While males may be exercising intersexual choice by selecting females with good territories, the question asks specifically about the competition among females, which is intrasexual, not intersexual.\n- Option B (Natural selection for food) is incomplete because, despite involving a resource, the selection here is specifically on traits that increase mating success via resource control, a hallmark of sexual selection. The problem states that territory quality is the primary determinant of how many mates a female can secure, directly tying the competition to mating success.\n- Option D (Kin selection) is unsupported; there is no indication that females are helping relatives or that inclusive fitness benefits via kin are driving the behavior.\n- Option E (Stabilizing selection) presumes a continuous distribution of territory sizes with intermediate optima favored; this is not described and does not address the competitive mechanism observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is intrasexual selection within females driven by resource control that grants access to mates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1855959"}, {"introduction": "We can move beyond simply identifying selection pressures to modeling the behavioral decisions animals make. This practice [@problem_id:1855915] uses a simple but powerful cost-benefit framework to analyze how an animal's competitive strategy can change based on social context, a phenomenon known as the \"audience effect.\" By translating a behavioral scenario into a set of logical and mathematical conditions, you will see how we can formalize hypotheses to make precise predictions about animal behavior.", "problem": "A behavioral ecologist is studying aggression in male Siamese fighting fish (*Betta splendens*). They propose a simple cost-benefit model to predict when a male will escalate a territorial dispute with a rival male to a high-intensity display, which is energetically costly and risky.\n\nThe model is based on the following parameters, all measured in arbitrary 'fitness units':\n- $B_W$: The baseline benefit of winning the dispute (e.g., securing territory), available whether or not a female is present.\n- $C_F$: The baseline cost of a high-intensity fight (e.g., energy expenditure, risk of injury).\n- $B_M$: The additional mating benefit gained from winning the dispute *if a female is observing*. This benefit is zero if no female is present.\n- $C_A$: The additional cost associated with performing a more vigorous display for an observing female (the \"audience cost\"). This cost is zero if no female is present.\n\nA rational male is predicted to escalate to a high-intensity fight only if the total expected benefit of winning is strictly greater than the total expected cost of fighting.\n\nThe \"audience effect\" is observed when a male fish escalates to a high-intensity fight *only* when a female is present, but refrains from doing so when no female is present.

This requires analyzing two separate scenarios based on the provided cost-benefit model.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the scenario where no female is present (no audience). In this case, the additional mating benefit $B_M$ and the additional audience cost $C_A$ are both zero. The total benefit of fighting is $B_W$, and the total cost is $C_F$. The problem states that the male refrains from escalating to a high-intensity fight. According to the model's decision rule, this means the net benefit is not strictly positive. In other words, the benefit is less than or equal to the cost. This gives us our first condition:\n$$B_W - C_F \\le 0$$\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n$$B_W \\le C_F \\quad \\text{(Condition 1)}$$\n\nSecond, let's analyze the scenario where a female is present (with an audience). In this case, the male gains an additional mating benefit $B_M$ and incurs an additional audience cost $C_A$. The total benefit of fighting is the sum of the baseline benefit and the mating benefit, $B_W + B_M$. The total cost of fighting is the sum of the baseline cost and the audience cost, $C_F + C_A$. The problem states that in this scenario, the male escalates to a high-intensity fight. According to the decision rule, this means the net benefit is strictly positive. This gives us our second condition:\n$$(B_W + B_M) - (C_F + C_A) > 0 \\quad \\text{(Condition 2)}$$\n\nFor the audience effect to be observed, both Condition 1 and Condition 2 must be true simultaneously. Condition 1, $B_W \\le C_F$, already forms the first part of the correct answer. Now, we need to simplify Condition 2 to express it in terms of the other variables, typically by isolating the variable that drives the change in behavior, which is $B_M$. Let's rearrange Condition 2 to solve for $B_M$:\n$$B_W + B_M > C_F + C_A$$\n$$B_M > C_F + C_A - B_W$$\n\nThus, the two conditions that must be simultaneously satisfied are:\n1. $B_W \\le C_F$\n2. $B_M > C_F + C_A - B_W$\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. $B_M > C_A$: This is insufficient as it ignores the baseline costs and benefits.\nB. $B_W \\le C_F$ and $B_M > C_A$: The first part is correct, but the second part is an oversimplification of the condition needed for the net benefit to be positive.\nC. $B_W > C_F$: This is the condition for fighting even without an audience, which contradicts the premise.\nD. $B_W \\le C_F$ and $B_M > C_A + C_F - B_W$: This perfectly matches our derived conditions.\nE. $B_M  C_A$ and $B_W > C_F$: This contradicts both conditions we derived.\n\nTherefore, the correct condition is given in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1855915"}, {"introduction": "Intersexual selection, or mate choice, drives the evolution of some of nature's most spectacular traits, from the peacock's tail to complex birdsongs.

By calculating a fitness metric that incorporates both immediate reproductive output and the probability of future survival, you will directly confront the critical trade-offs that shape an animal's life-history strategy.", "problem": "In a population of the hypothetical Gilded Thornbird, two distinct male mating strategies, driven by female choice (intersexual selection), have been observed. Ecologists aim to compare the relative fitness of these two strategies.\n\nThe first strategy is that of a \"Provider.\" These males capture a specific type of high-energy insect to present to a female as a nuptial gift. This provides a direct nutritional benefit to the female. A male attempting this strategy has a probability $p_P$ of successfully presenting the gift and mating in a given season, which results in him siring $N_P$ offspring. The significant effort and risk involved in this foraging reduces his probability of surviving to the next breeding season to $S_P$.\n\nThe second strategy is that of a \"Showman.\" These males grow a vibrant, iridescent throat patch called a gorget. This is an \"honest signal\" of genetic quality, an indirect benefit for the female. A male with a competitive gorget has a probability $p_S$ of being chosen by a female in a season, resulting in him siring $N_S$ offspring. The metabolic cost and increased predation risk of maintaining the gorget reduce his seasonal survival probability to $S_S$.\n\nTo quantify the evolutionary success of each strategy, a simplified fitness metric ($W$) is defined as the total expected number of offspring over a two-season period. This is calculated as the expected number of offspring sired in the current season plus the expected number of offspring in the subsequent season. Assume that any male who survives to the next season will achieve a baseline reproductive success of $N_0$ offspring in that second season.\n\nGiven the following field data:\n- Baseline reproductive success for a surviving male, $N_0 = 1.5$ offspring.\n- Provider strategy: $p_P = 0.60$, $N_P = 4.0$ offspring, $S_P = 0.40$.\n- Showman strategy: $p_S = 0.85$, $N_S = 3.0$ offspring, $S_S = 0.25$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the fitness of the Provider strategy to the fitness of the Showman strategy, $W_P / W_S$.
