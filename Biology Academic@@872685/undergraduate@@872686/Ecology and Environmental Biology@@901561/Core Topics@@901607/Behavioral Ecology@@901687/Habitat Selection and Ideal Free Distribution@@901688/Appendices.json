The Ideal Free Distribution is a fundamental model in behavioral ecology. The specified fitness functions are linear and monotonically decreasing, representing a standard, simple case of negative density dependence due to resource depletion. The problem is well-posed; it provides a complete set of equations and constraints (two fitness functions, one population constraint) for two unknown variables ($n_1, n_2$), which is sufficient to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and precise, using mathematical formalism. The problem is a standard application of the IFD model and does not violate any principles of scientific validity, logical consistency, or objectivity. It is not incomplete, contradictory, or trivial.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe core principle of the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) dictates that at equilibrium, the per-capita fitness in all occupied patches must be equal. Furthermore, no individual can improve its fitness by unilaterally moving to another patch. Let the equilibrium distribution of individuals be $(n_1^{\\ast}, n_2^{\\ast})$ and the corresponding equilibrium fitness be $W^{\\ast}$.\n\nFirst, we will assume that an internal equilibrium exists, which means both patches are occupied ($n_1^{\\ast}  0$ and $n_2^{\\ast}  0$). If this assumption holds, then the fitness in both patches must be equal at equilibrium:\n$$\nW_1(n_1^{\\ast}) = W_2(n_2^{\\ast}) = W^{\\ast}\n$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $n_1^{\\ast}$ and $n_2^{\\ast}$. The first equation is the equalization of fitness, and the second is the population conservation constraint:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n10 - 0.2\\, n_1^{\\ast} = 7 - 0.05\\, n_2^{\\ast} \\\\\nn_1^{\\ast} + n_2^{\\ast} = 60\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we can express $n_2^{\\ast}$ in terms of $n_1^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nn_2^{\\ast} = 60 - n_1^{\\ast}\n$$\nSubstitute this expression into the first equation:\n$$\n10 - 0.2\\, n_1^{\\ast} = 7 - 0.05\\, (60 - n_1^{\\ast})\n$$\nNow, we solve for $n_1^{\\ast}$. First, expand the right-hand side:\n$$\n10 - 0.2\\, n_1^{\\ast} = 7 - (0.05 \\times 60) + 0.05\\, n_1^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n10 - 0.2\\, n_1^{\\ast} = 7 - 3 + 0.05\\, n_1^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n10 - 0.2\\, n_1^{\\ast} = 4 + 0.05\\, n_1^{\\ast}\n$$\nGroup the terms containing $n_1^{\\ast}$ on one side and the constant terms on the other:\n$$\n10 - 4 = 0.2\\, n_1^{\\ast} + 0.05\\, n_1^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n6 = (0.2 + 0.05)\\, n_1^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n6 = 0.25\\, n_1^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving for $n_1^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nn_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{6}{0.25} = 24\n$$\nNow we find $n_2^{\\ast}$ using the conservation equation:\n$$\nn_2^{\\ast} = 60 - n_1^{\\ast} = 60 - 24 = 36\n$$\nThe calculated equilibrium distribution is $(n_1^{\\ast}, n_2^{\\ast}) = (24, 36)$. Since both $n_1^{\\ast} = 24$ and $n_2^{\\ast} = 36$ are positive, our initial assumption of an internal equilibrium with both patches occupied is validated. A boundary solution (where one patch is empty) is not the stable equilibrium.\n\nFinally, we calculate the common per-capita fitness level, $W^{\\ast}$, by substituting the equilibrium populations into either fitness function.\nUsing $W_1(n_1^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nW^{\\ast} = W_1(24) = 10 - 0.2 \\times 24 = 10 - 4.8 = 5.2\n$$\nTo verify, we also use $W_2(n_2^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nW^{\\ast} = W_2(36) = 7 - 0.05 \\times 36 = 7 - 1.8 = 5.2\n$$\nThe fitness values are indeed equal, confirming the consistency of our solution. The equilibrium fitness for any individual in the population is $W^{\\ast} = 5.2$.\n\nTherefore, the IFD allocation is $n_1^{\\ast} = 24$ and $n_2^{\\ast} = 36$, and the common per-capita fitness at this equilibrium is $5.2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 24  36  5.2 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2497598"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic equilibrium calculation, this problem asks you to derive a general rule for habitat selection under a different, but common, ecological scenario.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. The premises are standard for the formulation of an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) model with scramble competition. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe system is defined by a population of $N$ foragers distributed among $P$ patches. The per capita payoff in patch $i$ for $n_i$ foragers is given by $W_i(n_i) = \\frac{a_i}{n_i}$, where $a_i  0$. The total number of foragers is conserved, such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{P} n_i = N$. The system reaches an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD), which is characterized by two conditions:\n(i) No individual can improve its payoff by unilaterally changing patches.\n(ii) All occupied patches provide the same per capita payoff.\n\nFirst, we must address whether any patch can be unoccupied at equilibrium. Let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists at least one unoccupied patch. Let patch $k$ be one such patch, so $n_k = 0$. Let patch $j$ be an occupied patch, so $n_j  0$. According to the IFD definition, patch $j$ must yield a finite payoff, $W_j(n_j) = \\frac{a_j}{n_j}$. Now consider an individual from patch $j$ evaluating a move to the unoccupied patch $k$. If this individual were to move, it would be the first and only forager in patch $k$. The payoff it would receive is $W_k(1) = \\frac{a_k}{1} = a_k$. More generally, for a very small number of foragers $\\epsilon  0$ entering the patch, the payoff is $W_k(\\epsilon) = \\frac{a_k}{\\epsilon}$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, this payoff approaches infinity, i.e., $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} W_k(\\epsilon) = \\infty$.\nSince the payoff in the occupied patch $j$ is finite, $W_j(n_j) = \\frac{a_j}{n_j}  \\infty$, an individual in patch $j$ could achieve a much higher (formally, infinite) payoff by moving to the empty patch $k$. This directly violates the first condition of the IFD, which states that no individual can improve its payoff by moving. This contradiction proves that our initial assumption must be false. Therefore, given that all productivity parameters $a_i$ are strictly positive ($a_i  0$), no patch can be unoccupied at the IFD. All patches must be occupied, so $n_i  0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, P\\}$.\n\nNow we derive the general IFD allocation $\\{n_i\\}_{i=1}^{P}$.\nSince all $P$ patches are occupied, the second condition of the IFD states that the per capita payoff must be the same across all of them. Let us denote this common equilibrium payoff by $W^*$.\n$$W_1(n_1) = W_2(n_2) = \\dots = W_P(n_P) = W^*$$\nSubstituting the given payoff function:\n$$\\frac{a_1}{n_1} = \\frac{a_2}{n_2} = \\dots = \\frac{a_P}{n_P} = W^*$$\nFrom this set of equalities, we can express the number of foragers in any patch $i$, $n_i$, as a function of its productivity $a_i$ and the equilibrium payoff $W^*$:\n$$n_i = \\frac{a_i}{W^*} \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, P\\}$$\nThe total number of foragers must sum to $N$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{P} n_i = N$$\nSubstituting our expression for $n_i$ into this conservation equation gives:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{P} \\frac{a_i}{W^*} = N$$\nSince $W^*$ is a constant across all patches, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$\\frac{1}{W^*} \\sum_{i=1}^{P} a_i = N$$\nWe can now solve for the equilibrium payoff $W^*$:\n$$W^* = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{P} a_j}{N}$$\nNow that we have determined the common payoff $W^*$, we can find the specific allocation $n_i$ for each patch by substituting this expression back into the equation $n_i = a_i/W^*$:\n$$n_i = \\frac{a_i}{\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{P} a_j}{N}\\right)} = N \\frac{a_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{P} a_j}$$\nThis is the general formula for the IFD allocation. It shows that the number of foragers in a patch is directly proportional to that patch's productivity relative to the total productivity of the entire habitat.\n\nFinally, we apply this result to the specific case provided: $P=2$, $a_1=3$, $a_2=1$, and $N=80$.\nWe must compute the allocation $(n_1, n_2)$.\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the productivity parameters:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{2} a_j = a_1 + a_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$$\nNow, we use the derived formula to find $n_1$ and $n_2$:\nFor patch $1$:\n$$n_1 = N \\frac{a_1}{a_1 + a_2} = 80 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 60$$\nFor patch $2$:\n$$n_2 = N \\frac{a_2}{a_1 + a_2} = 80 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 20$$\nThe resulting allocation is $(n_1, n_2) = (60, 20)$. These are integers as required. We can verify the solution: $n_1 + n_2 = 60 + 20 = 80 = N$, and the payoffs are equal: $W_1(60) = \\frac{3}{60} = \\frac{1}{20}$ and $W_2(20) = \\frac{1}{20}$.
