This exercise applies a classic optimal foraging model to a digger wasp provisioning her young, demonstrating a crucial trade-off between the energy gained from prey and the time spent acquiring it [@problem_id:1870105]. By calculating the rate of energy provisioning, $R$, you will determine the most efficient strategy, gaining insight into how natural selection shapes behavior to maximize fitness returns from parental investment.", "problem": "A solitary female digger wasp provisions her nest to ensure the survival and growth of her single larva. Her strategy involves hunting spiders, paralyzing them, and sealing one inside a burrow with her egg. The paralyzed spider serves as the exclusive food source for the developing larva. The wasp's evolutionary fitness is closely linked to the efficiency of this provisioning process. We can model her optimal foraging strategy by assuming she aims to maximize the rate of energy delivery to the nest.\n\nThe rate of energy provisioning, $R$, is defined as the energy content of the captured prey, $E_{prey}$, divided by the total time spent foraging, $T_{total}$. The total time is the sum of the time spent searching for a prey item, $T_{search}$, and the time spent handling it (subduing, paralyzing, and transporting it to the nest), $T_{handle}$. The relationship is given by:\n$$R = \\frac{E_{prey}}{T_{search} + T_{handle}}$$\nAssume the average search time, $T_{search}$, to locate a suitable spider of any size is a constant 30 minutes. However, the handling time and the energy content vary with the size of the spider. The wasp has the following four prey size options available in her habitat:\n\nA. Small Spider: $E_{prey} = 80$ kJ, $T_{handle} = 10$ minutes\n\nB. Medium Spider: $E_{prey} = 150$ kJ, $T_{handle} = 25$ minutes\n\nC. Large Spider: $E_{prey} = 210$ kJ, $T_{handle} = 40$ minutes\n\nD. Extra-Large Spider: $E_{prey} = 240$ kJ, $T_{handle} = 60$ minutes\n\nBased on the principle of maximizing the rate of energy provisioning, determine which spider size represents the optimal choice for the wasp.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the optimal prey choice for a digger wasp by finding which option maximizes the rate of energy provisioning, $R$. The formula for this rate is given as:\n$$R = \\frac{E_{prey}}{T_{search} + T_{handle}}$$\nWe are given that the search time, $T_{search}$, is constant for all prey sizes at 30 minutes. The energy content, $E_{prey}$, and handling time, $T_{handle}$, for each potential prey choice are provided. To find the optimal choice, we must calculate the rate $R$ for each of the four options and then compare them.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the rate of energy provisioning for the Small Spider (Option A).\nFor this option, $E_{prey} = 80$ kJ and $T_{handle} = 10$ minutes.\nThe total foraging time is $T_{total} = T_{search} + T_{handle} = 30 \\text{ min} + 10 \\text{ min} = 40$ minutes.\nThe rate $R_A$ is:\n$$R_A = \\frac{80 \\text{ kJ}}{40 \\text{ min}} = 2.0 \\text{ kJ/min}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the rate of energy provisioning for the Medium Spider (Option B).\nFor this option, $E_{prey} = 150$ kJ and $T_{handle} = 25$ minutes.\nThe total foraging time is $T_{total} = T_{search} + T_{handle} = 30 \\text{ min} + 25 \\text{ min} = 55$ minutes.\nThe rate $R_B$ is:\n$$R_B = \\frac{150 \\text{ kJ}}{55 \\text{ min}} \\approx 2.727 \\text{ kJ/min}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the rate of energy provisioning for the Large Spider (Option C).\nFor this option, $E_{prey} = 210$ kJ and $T_{handle} = 40$ minutes.\nThe total foraging time is $T_{total} = T_{search} + T_{handle} = 30 \\text{ min} + 40 \\text{ min} = 70$ minutes.\nThe rate $R_C$ is:\n$$R_C = \\frac{210 \\text{ kJ}}{70 \\text{ min}} = 3.0 \\text{ kJ/min}$$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the rate of energy provisioning for the Extra-Large Spider (Option D).\nFor this option, $E_{prey} = 240$ kJ and $T_{handle} = 60$ minutes.\nThe total foraging time is $T_{total} = T_{search} + T_{handle} = 30 \\text{ min} + 60 \\text{ min} = 90$ minutes.\nThe rate $R_D$ is:\n$$R_D = \\frac{240 \\text{ kJ}}{90 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{24}{9} \\text{ kJ/min} = \\frac{8}{3} \\text{ kJ/min} \\approx 2.667 \\text{ kJ/min}$$\n\nStep 5: Compare the calculated rates to find the maximum.\nThe rates for the four options are:\n$R_A = 2.0$ kJ/min\n$R_B \\approx 2.727$ kJ/min\n$R_C = 3.0$ kJ/min\n$R_D \\approx 2.667$ kJ/min\n\nComparing these values, we see that $R_C = 3.0$ kJ/min is the highest rate. This means that hunting the Large Spider provides the most energy to the nest per unit of time spent foraging.\n\nTherefore, the Large Spider (Option C) is the optimal prey choice for the wasp.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1870105"}, {"introduction": "Parents may not invest equally in all their offspring; sometimes, it pays to favor one sex over the other.

This practice challenges you to think like an experimental biologist by evaluating different methods for testing a key idea in parental care theory [@problem_id:1870117]. You will analyze competing experimental designs to determine the most effective way to test whether a male's parental effort is directly influenced by his certainty of paternity.", "problem": "The Azure Cichlid (*Cichlasoma azureus*) is a small freshwater fish species where males establish and defend breeding territories. After a female lays a clutch of eggs in his nest, the male is solely responsible for parental care until the fry hatch. This care primarily consists of fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins to provide oxygen and prevent fungal growth. Biologists hypothesize that the intensity of this paternal care is proportional to the male's certainty of his paternity. A lower perceived certainty of paternity is expected to result in reduced parental investment to avoid caring for unrelated offspring.\n\nYou are tasked with designing an experiment to test this hypothesis. Assume you have access to a large population of Azure Cichlids in a controlled laboratory environment consisting of numerous individual tanks, each containing a single male's territory. You can reliably measure the total time a male spends fanning his clutch of eggs over a 24-hour period.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs provides the most direct and rigorous test of the hypothesis that paternal care is proportional to a male's certainty of paternity?\n\nA. In one group of nests (Group 1), artificially reduce the fanning behavior of the father by placing a fine mesh over the eggs that obstructs his fins. In a control group (Group 2), no mesh is used. After the fry hatch, use genetic markers to determine the actual paternity rate for the male in both groups.\n\nB. Set up a series of tanks and allow males to establish territories and breed naturally. After eggs are laid, conduct a purely observational study where you record the fanning duration for each male and simultaneously observe and count the number of rival \"sneaker\" males that were present near the nest during the spawning event. Analyze the correlation between the number of nearby rivals and fanning time.\n\nC. Establish two groups of tanks. In the experimental group (Group 1), introduce a model of a known cichlid predator into the tank for one hour each day after the eggs are laid. In the control group (Group 2), no predator model is introduced. Compare the fanning duration between the two groups.\n\nD. Establish two groups of tanks. In the experimental group (Group 1), the territorial male is captured and removed from his tank for a short period *during* which the female is laying her eggs, and then he is returned. This simulates an opportunity for sneaker males to fertilize the eggs. In the control group (Group 2), the male is also captured and handled for the same duration but is removed *before* the female is introduced for spawning. Compare the fanning duration between the males in Group 1 and Group 2 after the eggs are laid.\n\nE. Allow a large number of males to breed. After each male has cared for his clutch for a fixed number of days, collect a sample of eggs from each nest. Use genetic markers to determine the actual percentage of eggs in the clutch sired by the caring male. Then, correlate this measured paternity percentage with the previously recorded fanning duration for each male.", "solution": "The hypothesis states that paternal care intensity is proportional to a male’s certainty of paternity. To test causality rigorously, the experimental design must: (i) manipulate the male’s certainty of paternity as the independent variable, (ii) measure fanning duration as the dependent variable, (iii) include appropriate controls to isolate certainty-of-paternity from confounds such as handling stress or predator risk, and (iv) avoid purely correlational inference.\n\nEvaluate each option relative to these criteria.\n\nOption A manipulates the male’s ability to fan by obstructing his fins with a mesh and then measures genetic paternity after hatching. This alters the dependent variable directly rather than the independent variable (certainty of paternity). It neither manipulates nor measures the male’s perceived certainty during care; therefore it does not test the stated hypothesis and is confounded by the imposed constraint on care.\n\nOption B is purely observational and correlates fanning with the number of rival males observed near the nest. This relies on a proxy for certainty and lacks experimental control; numerous confounds (male quality, territory quality, female behavior, time-of-day effects) can bias both rival presence and paternal care. It is not a rigorous causal test.\n\nOption C manipulates predator risk, not certainty of paternity. Any change in fanning would reflect responses to predation risk or stress, not to paternity certainty. This does not address the hypothesis.\n\nOption D manipulates the male’s certainty of paternity by removing him during the female’s egg-laying period, thereby creating an apparent opportunity for sneaker fertilization while keeping a handling-control in which the male is removed for the same duration but at a time that cannot affect paternity (before female introduction). The independent variable (certainty of paternity) is directly manipulated via a causal cue that males use in nature (presence/absence during spawning). The dependent variable (fanning duration) is measured afterward. The control equalizes handling stress and disturbance. All other conditions can be held constant across tanks, and random assignment ensures internal validity. This design provides a direct and rigorous causal test of whether paternal care intensity decreases when certainty of paternity is experimentally reduced.\n\nOption E correlates actual genetic paternity with fanning time. While informative, it tests the relationship between realized paternity and care, not the male’s perceived certainty. Because males act on cues rather than genotypes, actual paternity may diverge from perceived certainty, and many confounds (male quality, female choice, territory quality) may influence both paternity and care. Without manipulating certainty, this remains correlational and less direct than Option D.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and rigorous test of the stated hypothesis is achieved by experimentally manipulating certainty of paternity while controlling for confounds, as in Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1870117"}]}
