{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The fascinating array of plant defenses are ultimately traits encoded by genes. This first exercise applies fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics to predict the prevalence of a chemical defense trait in a plant population, linking the genotype of an individual plant to its ecological role as either defended or palatable. By working through a simple cross, you will see how inheritance patterns directly shape the defensive landscape an herbivore might encounter. [@problem_id:1872800]", "problem": "The moonpetal flower (*Lunaria flora*) has evolved a chemical defense mechanism against herbivory. Certain individuals produce a bitter-tasting alkaloid in their leaves, making them unpalatable to most grazers. The production of this alkaloid is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The allele that codes for alkaloid production, denoted by $B$, is completely dominant over the allele for no production, denoted by $b$. Consequently, plants with either the $BB$ or $Bb$ genotype are chemically defended, while plants with the $bb$ genotype are undefended and palatable.\n\nA field biologist working on a conservation project performs a controlled cross. The first parent plant is selected from a population exposed to high herbivore pressure and is known to be heterozygous for the trait ($Bb$). The second parent plant is selected from a genetically isolated, herbivore-free sanctuary and is known to be homozygous recessive ($bb$).\n\nAssuming standard Mendelian inheritance and that all offspring are viable, what proportion of the offspring from this cross is expected to be chemically defended? Express your answer as a decimal fraction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the proportion of offspring that are chemically defended from a cross between a heterozygous parent ($Bb$) and a homozygous recessive parent ($bb$).\n\nFirst, we identify the genotypes of the two parent plants as given in the problem statement:\nParent 1: Heterozygous, with genotype $Bb$.\nParent 2: Homozygous recessive, with genotype $bb$.\n\nNext, we determine the types of gametes that each parent can produce through meiosis.\nParent 1 ($Bb$) can produce two types of gametes: one carrying the dominant allele $B$ and one carrying the recessive allele $b$. The probability of producing each type of gamete is 0.5.\nParent 2 ($bb$) can produce only one type of gamete: all its gametes will carry the recessive allele $b$. The probability of producing a $b$ gamete is 1.\n\nTo find the genotypes of the offspring, we can consider the possible combinations of these gametes. This is often visualized with a Punnett square, but we can also calculate it directly using probabilities.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes for the fertilization:\n1.  A gamete from Parent 1 with allele $B$ fertilizes a gamete from Parent 2 with allele $b$. The resulting offspring will have the genotype $Bb$. The probability of this event is the product of the probabilities of each gamete being involved: $P(B) \\times P(b) = 0.5 \\times 1.0 = 0.5$.\n2.  A gamete from Parent 1 with allele $b$ fertilizes a gamete from Parent 2 with allele $b$. The resulting offspring will have the genotype $bb$. The probability of this event is: $P(b) \\times P(b) = 0.5 \\times 1.0 = 0.5$.\n\nSo, we expect the offspring genotypes to be 50% $Bb$ and 50% $bb$.\n\nNow, we must relate these genotypes to the phenotypes (chemical defense). The problem states that the allele for alkaloid production ($B$) is completely dominant. This means that any plant with at least one $B$ allele will be chemically defended.\n-   Offspring with genotype $Bb$ will produce the alkaloid and are therefore chemically defended.\n-   Offspring with genotype $bb$ will not produce the alkaloid and are undefended.\n\nThe proportion of offspring that are chemically defended is the proportion of offspring with the $Bb$ genotype. Based on our calculation, this proportion is 0.5.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction. The proportion 0.5 is already in this form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "1872800"}, {"introduction": "Plants must allocate resources wisely, and maintaining a high level of defense at all times can be energetically expensive. This practice challenges you to think like an experimental ecologist, tasking you with designing a rigorous study to distinguish between a defense that is always present (constitutive) and one that is activated only upon attack (induced). Making this distinction is critical for understanding the dynamic nature of plant-herbivore interactions and the economics of survival. [@problem_id:1764240]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the defense mechanisms of the common dandelion, *Taraxacum officinale*. When the plant's tissues are damaged, it exudes a white, bitter-tasting latex, which is known to deter many herbivores. The ecologist wants to determine whether this latex production is a constitutive defense or an induced defense.\n\nA **constitutive defense** is a defense mechanism that is always present in the plant at a relatively constant level, regardless of whether the plant has been recently attacked.\nAn **induced defense** is one that is synthesized or mobilized to the site of injury only after the plant detects damage from an herbivore.\n\nThe ecologist has access to a large, uniform population of dandelion plants grown in a controlled greenhouse environment. Which of the following experimental designs is the most scientifically rigorous and appropriate for distinguishing between these two types of defense?\n\nA. Collect dandelion plants from a field heavily grazed by rabbits and compare the average volume of latex per plant to the average volume from dandelions collected from a nearby, protected field where rabbits are absent.\n\nB. Randomly divide the greenhouse population into two groups. Artificially damage the leaves of one group (the \"treatment\" group) with scissors. Leave the other group (the \"control\" group) untouched. After several days, measure and compare the volume of latex produced upon a fresh, standardized injury in plants from both the treatment and control groups.\n\nC. Randomly select a group of plants from the greenhouse population. For each plant, measure the volume of latex produced from a small, initial cut. Immediately afterward, extensively damage the rest of the plant's leaves and then re-measure the latex flow from a new cut on the same plant.\n\nD. Randomly divide the greenhouse population into two groups. Measure the initial latex volume from a standardized cut in all plants in both groups. Then, apply a chemical pesticide to one group to simulate protection from herbivores and do nothing to the other group. After several weeks, measure the latex volume from a new standardized cut in both groups and compare the change over time.", "solution": "We aim to distinguish between constitutive and induced defenses operationally: a constitutive defense is present at a relatively constant baseline irrespective of recent damage, whereas an induced defense increases after damage and requires time for synthesis or mobilization. The most rigorous test therefore requires (i) random assignment to treatment and control to eliminate confounding, (ii) an explicit damage treatment to elicit induction, (iii) sufficient time between induction and measurement to allow a physiological response, and (iv) a standardized, fresh assay injury to measure latex production without depletion artifacts from prior cuts.\n\nEvaluate each proposed design against these criteria:\n\nOption A compares field-collected plants from grazed versus ungrazed sites. This is not a controlled experiment and is confounded by environmental differences (soil, nutrients, microclimate), plant age and size structure, and genetic composition between sites. Moreover, prior herbivory in the grazed site may itself induce defenses, so any observed difference conflates induction history with genetics and environment. This design cannot isolate induced versus constitutive mechanisms.\n\nOption B uses a uniform greenhouse population with random assignment to treatment (artificial damage) and control (no damage), allows several days for induction, and then assays latex production using a fresh, standardized injury in both groups. This directly tests for inducibility while controlling for baseline constitutive levels: if latex is constitutive, treatment and control will not differ; if latex is induced, previously damaged plants will show increased latex upon the standardized assay. Randomization, a control group, standardized measurement, and an induction interval make this design rigorous and appropriate.\n\nOption C measures latex from an initial small cut, then immediately applies extensive damage and re-measures from a new cut on the same plant. The initial cut depletes latex and itself serves as an inducing stimulus. Immediate re-measurement does not allow sufficient time for induction, and depletion confounds interpretation. The within-plant repeat without an appropriate time interval and control group prevents clean separation of constitutive baseline from induced increase.\n\nOption D measures initial latex from all plants, then applies a pesticide to one group and waits several weeks before re-measuring. The initial standardized cut given to all plants is itself damage that can induce defenses in both groups, so both groups are potentially induced. The pesticide does not simulate herbivore damage and does not isolate an induction effect; any later differences could result from pesticide side effects rather than defense induction. Thus, it does not cleanly distinguish constitutive from induced defenses.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the most scientifically rigorous and appropriate design for distinguishing constitutive versus induced latex defense in this system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1764240"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of a plant's chemical weapon is its measurable impact on the herbivore.
