[@problem_id:1831747]", "problem": "An ancestral population of a non-venomous, palatable snake species is introduced to two isolated tropical islands, Island S and Island A. The islands are ecologically similar, with comparable habitats and a suite of avian and mammalian predators that possess color vision and can learn to avoid dangerous prey.\n\nThe key difference between the islands is the presence of other species. Island S is home to a highly venomous coral snake species that is abundant and displays a conspicuous aposematic (warning) coloration of red, yellow, and black rings. In contrast, Island A has no venomous snakes or any other animal that exhibits a similar red, yellow, and black warning pattern.\n\nAssuming sufficient time has passed for natural selection to act, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected evolutionary divergence in coloration for the harmless snake populations on Island S and Island A?\n\nA. The population on Island S will evolve the red, yellow, and black ring pattern, while the population on Island A will retain the ancestral coloration, as there is no selective pressure to change.\n\nB. Both populations will evolve the red, yellow, and black ring pattern, as this bright coloration is inherently effective at deterring all predators, regardless of experience.\n\nC. The population on Island S will evolve cryptic coloration (camouflage) to avoid being mistaken for the venomous model, while the population on Island A will evolve the red, yellow, and black ring pattern due to a lack of negative selection.\n\nD. The population on Island S will evolve the red, yellow, and black ring pattern, while the population on Island A will evolve cryptic coloration that blends with the local environment.\n\nE. Both populations will evolve cryptic coloration to best avoid detection, as being conspicuous is always a disadvantage for a harmless species.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the relevant evolutionary principles. Predators with color vision that can learn to avoid dangerous prey will associate a conspicuous warning pattern with unprofitability when repeated adverse experiences occur. Aposematism evolves in genuinely unprofitable prey (e.g., venomous species) and can be exploited by harmless, palatable species via Batesian mimicry, where a palatable mimic gains protection by resembling a defended model. The effectiveness of Batesian mimicry depends on predator learning and is frequency-dependent: it is advantageous for the mimic primarily when the defended model is sufficiently common, so that predators maintain avoidance of the warning pattern.\n\nOn Island S, the venomous coral snake with conspicuous red, yellow, and black rings is abundant. Predators will learn to associate this particular color pattern with danger due to adverse experiences with the venomous species. Therefore, natural selection favors harmless snakes that resemble the coral snake pattern, because such individuals will be avoided more often by predators. This constitutes Batesian mimicry and generates selection for the evolution of the red, yellow, and black ring pattern in the harmless population. The presence and abundance of the model ensure that the mimic’s conspicuousness yields a net fitness benefit.\n\nOn Island A, there is no venomous coral snake or any species exhibiting a similar warning pattern. Thus, predators have no basis to associate the red, yellow, and black pattern with danger. For a palatable species, adopting a conspicuous, non-reinforced warning pattern would increase detection and attack rates without any avoidance benefit. Consequently, selection will favor reduced detectability, i.e., cryptic coloration that blends with the local environment, rather than conspicuous patterns. There is also active selective pressure to change if the ancestral state is not optimally cryptic in the local environment; hence it is inaccurate to claim there is no selective pressure on Island A.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because stating there is no selective pressure to change on Island A is wrong; selection favors crypsis in the absence of a protected model.\n- Option B is incorrect because bright coloration is not inherently deterrent; it requires learned association with unprofitability.\n- Option C is incorrect because on Island S resemblance to the venomous model is beneficial, not detrimental; cryptic coloration would forgo the available protective resemblance.\n- Option D is correct: on Island S, the harmless snakes evolve the warning ring pattern via Batesian mimicry; on Island A, they evolve cryptic coloration due to the absence of a model and the costs of conspicuousness.\n- Option E is incorrect because conspicuousness is advantageous for harmless species only when protected by a common unprofitable model.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1831747"}, {"introduction": "The protection gained by a mimic is not guaranteed; it depends critically on how often predators encounter the harmful model versus the harmless mimic. This practice introduces a simple mathematical model to quantify this relationship, illustrating the principle of negative frequency-dependent selection. You will calculate how the survival advantage for a mimic changes as its population grows, making an abstract concept concrete. [@problem_id:1831740]", "problem": "In an ecosystem, a species of harmless syrphid fly has evolved to mimic the black-and-yellow warning coloration of a local, venomous wasp species. This is a classic example of Batesian mimicry, where a palatable species gains protection by resembling a noxious one. The effectiveness of this mimicry, however, depends on the relative populations of the model (the wasp) and the mimic (the fly), as this influences the learning behavior of local predators, such as birds.\n\nA simple model describes the \"mimicry effectiveness index,\" denoted by $E$, for an individual fly. This index represents the probability that a predator, upon encountering a mimic fly, will be deterred from attacking due to prior negative experiences with the noxious wasp model. The model is given by the equation:\n$$E = \\frac{\\alpha N_W}{\\alpha N_W + \\beta N_F}$$\nwhere:\n- $N_W$ is the population size of the wasps.\n- $N_F$ is the population size of the flies.\n- $\\alpha$ is a 'learning parameter' representing how effectively a single encounter with a wasp teaches a predator avoidance.\n- $\\beta$ is a 'forgetting parameter' representing how effectively an encounter with a palatable fly causes a predator to abandon its learned avoidance.\n\nConsider a stable ecosystem where the wasp population is $N_W = 5000$. The predator learning and forgetting parameters have been estimated to be $\\alpha = 0.8$ and $\\beta = 0.1$. Initially, the mimic fly population is negligible, but due to the survival advantage conferred by mimicry, its population grows significantly.\n\nCalculate the value of the mimicry effectiveness index, $E$, for an individual fly when the fly population has grown to $N_F = 30000$. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The mimicry effectiveness index is defined by\n$$E=\\frac{\\alpha N_{W}}{\\alpha N_{W}+\\beta N_{F}}.$$\nSubstituting the given values $N_{W}=5000$, $N_{F}=30000$, $\\alpha=0.8$, and $\\beta=0.1$ yields\n$$E=\\frac{(0.8)(5000)}{(0.8)(5000)+(0.1)(30000)}.$$\nCompute the products in the numerator and denominator:\n$$(0.8)(5000)=4000,\\quad (0.1)(30000)=3000.$$\nThus,\n$$E=\\frac{4000}{4000+3000}=\\frac{4000}{7000}=\\frac{4}{7}.$$\nConverting to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures gives\n$$\\frac{4}{7}\\approx 0.571428\\ldots \\approx 0.571.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.571}$$", "id": "1831740"}, {"introduction": "Mimicry complexes, while seemingly stable, are maintained by a delicate balance of interactions between models, mimics, and predators. This scenario challenges you to predict the consequences when a new predator, which is immune to the model's defenses, enters the system. Analyzing this disruption reveals the underlying mechanisms that uphold both Batesian and Müllerian mimicry and how quickly they can unravel. [@problem_id:1831762]", "problem": "On a remote island, a stable ecological community includes three insect species that participate in a mimicry complex. Species A (a bee) and Species B (a wasp) are both venomous and share a nearly identical, conspicuous yellow-and-black warning coloration. Their shared signal is an example of Müllerian mimicry, where two or more well-defended species mutually benefit by adopting a common aposematic signal. Species C (a hoverfly) is completely harmless but has evolved to closely resemble the bees and wasps, an example of Batesian mimicry. The primary predators on the island are native birds that learn, after a few unpleasant encounters, to avoid insects with this specific coloration.\n\nA new predator, a species of honey badger, is introduced to the island. This predator is \"naive,\" meaning it has no prior experience with the local fauna. Critically, this honey badger species possesses a genetic immunity to the venoms of both the bees and the wasps, so it receives no negative consequences from eating them. The honey badger hunts by sight and becomes a significant new source of predation on all three insect species.\n\nGiven this scenario, what is the most likely long-term evolutionary outcome for the mimicry complex?\n\nA. The Müllerian mimicry between the bees and wasps will be reinforced because the increased predation culls weaker individuals, while the Batesian mimicry of the hoverfly will be eliminated.\nB. The Batesian mimicry will be strengthened, as the hoverflies now have two distinct predators to \"trick\", while the Müllerian mimicry between bees and wasps remains unaffected.\nC. The entire mimicry complex will be strengthened, as the new predator will eventually learn to associate the warning coloration with the less-preferred taste of the insects compared to other available prey.\nD. The selective pressure that maintains the distinct warning coloration will be reduced or even reversed for the defended species (bees and wasps), potentially leading to the breakdown of the entire mimicry complex.\nE. The populations of all three species will evolve to become more venomous as a direct response to the new, highly effective predator.", "solution": "Aposematic warning coloration is adaptive when predators experience a fitness cost from attacking defended prey and consequently learn to avoid the warning signal. In Müllerian mimicry, multiple defended species share a conspicuous signal, and positive frequency-dependent selection arises because every attack on any model reinforces avoidance of the whole signal class. In Batesian mimicry, an undefended mimic gains protection because predators generalize avoidance from defended models to all bearers of the signal; this protection is strongest when defended models are common relative to mimics and when predators incur costs from attacking models.\n\nIntroducing a naive predator that is genetically immune to the venoms of the defended species removes the key mechanism that sustains aposematism for that predator: there is no aversive reinforcement from attacking bees or wasps. Because the honey badger hunts by sight and suffers no negative consequence from consuming either defended species, the shared conspicuous yellow-and-black signal ceases to function as a deterrent for that predator. Instead, it becomes a reliable visual cue that identifies edible prey. Since the honey badger becomes a significant source of predation, the net selection on the warning coloration in bees and wasps is reduced or can even reverse if the badger’s predation pressure outweighs the avoidance by native birds. Under such conditions, selection may favor reduced conspicuousness or divergence from the shared aposematic pattern, undermining the mutual reinforcement that maintains Müllerian mimicry.\n\nFor the Batesian mimic, the hoverfly’s protection depends on predators avoiding the signal because of the defended models. The honey badger’s immunity removes this protection; it will attack hoverflies as readily as the models, eroding the benefit of Batesian mimicry. Moreover, if bees and wasps evolve away from the aposematic pattern due to the new predation regime, the model signal degrades, further reducing any residual protection for the mimic.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of an immune, visually hunting predator that exerts substantial predation pressure reduces or reverses selection maintaining the shared warning coloration in the defended species and concurrently destroys the protection of the Batesian mimic. The most likely long-term outcome is the breakdown of the entire mimicry complex. This matches option D and contradicts the alternatives: reinforcement of Müllerian mimicry (A) is unlikely because attacks incur no cost to the predator; strengthening of Batesian mimicry with Müllerian unaffected (B) is inconsistent with the loss of predator avoidance; global strengthening due to learned distaste (C) is precluded by immunity and lack of aversive reinforcement; and escalation of venom potency across all three species (E) is not a viable response given predator immunity and the hoverfly’s lack of venom.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1831762"}]}
