This advanced practice introduces you to Stable Isotope Probing (SIP), a modern technique that uses 'labeled' atoms to follow the flow of carbon from the plant to the fungus in a real ecosystem.

Their goal is to quantify the extent to which a dominant grass species, *Festuca arundinacea*, directly provides recently assimilated carbon to a specific species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, *Rhizophagus irregularis*. To achieve this, they conduct a field experiment using a technique known as Stable Isotope Probing (SIP).\n\nAn airtight, transparent chamber is placed over a patch of the grassland dominated by *F. arundinacea*. For a period of 72 hours, the atmosphere within the chamber is continuously replenished with carbon dioxide enriched with the heavy isotope carbon-13 (${}^{13}\\text{CO}_2$). An adjacent, identical patch of grassland serves as a control and is enclosed in a similar chamber but supplied with air containing carbon dioxide with the natural abundance of isotopes (predominantly ${}^{12}\\text{C}$).\n\nFollowing the labeling period, soil samples containing the plant roots and fungal hyphae are collected from the center of both the labeled and control plots. Total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is extracted from these soil samples. The extracted DNA is then separated by density using cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation, which physically separates the \"heavy\" DNA (containing incorporated ${}^{13}\\text{C}$) from the \"light\" DNA (containing only ${}^{12}\\text{C}$).\n\nThe amount of *R. irregularis* DNA in both the heavy and light fractions is then precisely measured using Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) targeting the fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region. The following data were obtained, with all DNA quantities expressed in nanograms per gram of dry soil (ng/g soil):\n\n**Control Plot Data (Unlabeled):**\n- Quantity of *R. irregularis* DNA in the light fraction: $C_L = 215.0$ ng/g soil\n- Quantity of *R. irregularis* DNA in the heavy fraction: $C_H = 2.40$ ng/g soil\n\n**Labeled Plot Data (${}^{13}\\text{C}$-enriched):**\n- Quantity of *R. irregularis* DNA in the light fraction: $L_L = 168.0$ ng/g soil\n- Quantity of *R. irregularis* DNA in the heavy fraction: $L_H = 59.5$ ng/g soil\n\nTo quantify the active carbon transfer, you are asked to calculate the \"Isotopic Enrichment Factor\" ($E_f$).
