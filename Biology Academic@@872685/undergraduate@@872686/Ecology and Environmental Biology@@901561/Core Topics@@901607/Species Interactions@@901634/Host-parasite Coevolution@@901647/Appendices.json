A foundational concept for understanding this is the gene-for-gene model, which describes a specific molecular recognition system between hosts and parasites. This practice provides a quantitative look at such a system, asking you to connect the genetic makeup of both the host and parasite populations to the overall probability of infection [@problem_id:1938917]. By applying principles of population genetics, you will calculate how allele frequencies translate into real-world ecological outcomes.", "problem": "In an ecological study of coevolution, a population of a wild grass (the host) is observed to be in a dynamic relationship with a pathogenic rust fungus (the parasite). The interaction is governed by a simple gene-for-gene model involving a single locus in each species.\n\nIn the host plant, a single locus with two alleles determines resistance. The allele $R$ is dominant and codes for a receptor protein, while the allele $r$ is recessive and does not produce a functional receptor.\n\nIn the parasite fungus, a single locus with two alleles determines its ability to be detected. The allele $A$ is dominant and codes for an avirulence signal protein, while the allele $a$ is recessive and does not produce this signal protein.\n\nA successful host defense (i.e., resistance) occurs if and only if a host plant possesses at least one $R$ allele to produce the receptor, and the infecting fungus possesses at least one $A$ allele to produce the corresponding signal. All other combinations of host and parasite genotypes result in a successful infection.\n\nField surveys indicate that both populations are large, diploid, and can be modeled as being in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The frequency of the resistance allele $R$ in the host population is 0.75. The frequency of the avirulence allele $A$ in the parasite population is 0.40.\n\nAssuming that any host is equally likely to be encountered by any parasite, calculate the overall proportion of random encounters that will result in a successful infection for the parasite. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the overall proportion of encounters that result in a successful infection. A successful infection occurs in any scenario except for the specific case of resistance. Therefore, it is easier to first calculate the probability of resistance, $P(\\text{Resistance})$, and then find the probability of infection, $P(\\text{Infection})$, using the relationship $P(\\text{Infection}) = 1 - P(\\text{Resistance})$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, resistance occurs if and only if the host has a resistant genotype (at least one $R$ allele) AND the parasite has an avirulent genotype (at least one $A$ allele). Since the encounters are random, the probabilities of the host and parasite genotypes are independent.\nTherefore, $P(\\text{Resistance}) = P(\\text{Host is resistant}) \\times P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent})$.\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities.\n\nFirst, consider the host population.\nLet $p_H$ be the frequency of the $R$ allele and $q_H$ be the frequency of the $r$ allele.\nWe are given $p_H = f(R) = 0.75$.\nSince there are only two alleles, $q_H = f(r) = 1 - p_H = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n\nThe host is resistant if its genotype is $RR$ or $Rr$. The host is susceptible only if its genotype is $rr$. Since the population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), we can calculate the frequency of the susceptible genotype $rr$ as $f(rr) = q_H^2$.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen host is resistant, $P(\\text{Host is resistant})$, is $1 - f(rr)$.\nSymbolically, $P(\\text{Host is resistant}) = 1 - q_H^2$.\nSubstituting the value of $q_H$:\n$P(\\text{Host is resistant}) = 1 - (0.25)^2 = 1 - 0.0625 = 0.9375$.\n\nNext, consider the parasite population.\nLet $p_P$ be the frequency of the $A$ allele and $q_P$ be the frequency of the $a$ allele.\nWe are given $p_P = f(A) = 0.40$.\nSince there are only two alleles, $q_P = f(a) = 1 - p_P = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n\nThe parasite is avirulent (i.e., it can be detected by a resistant host) if its genotype is $AA$ or $Aa$. The parasite is virulent (stealthy) if its genotype is $aa$. Since the population is in HWE, the frequency of the virulent genotype $aa$ is $f(aa) = q_P^2$.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen parasite is avirulent, $P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent})$, is $1 - f(aa)$.\nSymbolically, $P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent}) = 1 - q_P^2$.\nSubstituting the value of $q_P$:\n$P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent}) = 1 - (0.60)^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64$.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of a resistant interaction.\n$P(\\text{Resistance}) = P(\\text{Host is resistant}) \\times P(\\text{Parasite is avirulent})$\n$P(\\text{Resistance}) = 0.9375 \\times 0.64 = 0.60$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability of a successful infection.\n$P(\\text{Infection}) = 1 - P(\\text{Resistance})$\n$P(\\text{Infection}) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\n\nThe question asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$0.40$ can be written as $0.4000$ to satisfy this requirement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4000}$$", "id": "1938917"}, {"introduction": "While the gene-for-gene model provides a snapshot of host-parasite interactions, coevolution is a dynamic process unfolding over generations.

The grass population exhibits genetic variation for resistance, primarily controlled by a single dominant allele, $R$. The fungal pathogen population has a corresponding virulence allele, $v$, which allows it to successfully infect plants carrying the $R$ allele. Genotypes $rr$ are susceptible to all pathogen strains, while plants with at least one $R$ allele are resistant unless infected by a pathogen carrying the $v$ allele.\n\nOver the course of the study, researchers tracked the frequencies of the resistance allele $R$ in the grass population and the virulence allele $v$ in the pathogen population. The data revealed a distinct pattern:\n1.  The frequency of the host resistance allele $R$ was not static; it oscillated, rising to a peak and then falling to a trough, with a period of approximately 150 generations.\n2.  The frequency of the parasite virulence allele $v$ also oscillated with a similar period.\n3.  Crucially, the peaks in the frequency of the parasite's $v$ allele were consistently observed to occur approximately 20-25 generations after the peaks in the frequency of the host's $R$ allele. Likewise, troughs in the frequency of $v$ trailed troughs in the frequency of $R$.\n\nWhich of the following evolutionary concepts provides the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for this observed time-lagged cyclical pattern in allele frequencies?\n\nA.

While resistance—preventing infection entirely—is one common approach, an alternative is tolerance, which involves minimizing the harm caused by an infection that is already established.

The parasite is present in the environment, and any given host individual encounters and becomes infected by it with a probability $p$, known as the parasite prevalence. In response to this threat, two distinct defensive strategies have been observed in the host population: resistance and tolerance.\n\nThe fitness of individuals is modeled as follows, with a baseline fitness normalized to 1 in the absence of any costs or infection:\n\n1.  **Resistant Individuals**: These individuals have a specialized immune system that renders them completely immune to the parasite. This strategy comes with a significant metabolic burden, resulting in a constant, constitutive fitness cost $c_r$. Therefore, the fitness of a resistant individual is always $1 - c_r$, regardless of the parasite prevalence $p$.\n\n2.  **Tolerant Individuals**: These individuals do not prevent infection. They have no constitutive fitness cost when uninfected, and thus their fitness is 1 in that state. However, if they become infected (which occurs with probability $p$), they mount a tolerance response. This response completely neutralizes the parasite's harmful effects on their health, but activating this response incurs a fitness cost $c_t$. Consequently, an infected tolerant individual has a fitness of $1 - c_t$.\n\nAssume that the costs $c_r$ and $c_t$ are positive and less than 1. The choice between these two strategies depends on the epidemiological landscape.\n\nDerive an expression for the critical parasite prevalence, $p_{crit}$, at which the average fitness of a resistant individual is exactly equal to the average fitness of a tolerant individual.
