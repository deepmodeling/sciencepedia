This practice introduces the one-sample $t$-test, a fundamental tool for comparing a sample mean against a known or hypothesized population mean.

Historical data collected over the last 50 years show that the average body weight of an adult fox is stable at a population mean of $\\mu_0 = 1.80$ kg. The biologist is concerned that recent changes in food availability might be impacting the health of the current fox population. To investigate this, a research team captured and weighed a random sample of $n=36$ adult foxes.
