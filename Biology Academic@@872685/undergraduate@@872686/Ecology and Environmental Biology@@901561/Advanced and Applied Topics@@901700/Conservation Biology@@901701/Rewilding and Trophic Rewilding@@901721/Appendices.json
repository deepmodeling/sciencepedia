{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "At the heart of many rewilding projects is the concept of the trophic cascade, where the reintroduction of an apex predator creates ripple effects down the food web. To determine if a project is successful, ecologists must design monitoring plans that directly track these effects. This first practice challenges you to think critically about cause and effect by selecting the most direct faunal and floral indicators to assess the impact of wolf reintroduction on an elk-aspen system, a classic example of trophic rewilding [@problem_id:1878599].", "problem": "A conservation team is managing a large, remote national park. For decades, the absence of apex predators led to a significant overpopulation of elk (*Cervus canadensis*). This has resulted in widespread overgrazing, particularly impacting the growth and survival of young aspen trees (*Populus tremuloides*), which are a key food source for elk. To restore ecological balance, the team has reintroduced a population of gray wolves (*Canis lupus*), which are considered a keystone predator in this ecosystem.\n\nThe primary goal of the reintroduction is to initiate a trophic cascade, where the wolves, by preying on or altering the behavior of the elk, indirectly facilitate the recovery of the aspen groves. The team needs to establish a simple yet effective monitoring plan to evaluate the success of this rewilding project over the next decade. The plan must focus on one primary faunal indicator and one primary floral indicator that are most directly linked to this specific trophic cascade.\n\nWhich of the following monitoring plans would be the most direct and effective for assessing the success of the wolf reintroduction in restoring the elk-aspen interaction?\n\nA. Monitoring the number of wolf packs established (faunal) and the annual seed production of mature pine trees (floral).\n\nB. Monitoring the population size of coyotes, a smaller competing predator (faunal), and the overall vegetation greenness measured by satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (floral).\n\nC. Monitoring the population density and spatial distribution of elk (faunal) and the height and recruitment rate of young aspen saplings in previously overgrazed areas (floral).\n\nD. Monitoring the population abundance of scavenger species like ravens that feed on wolf kills (faunal) and the nitrogen content in the soil of aspen groves (floral).\n\nE. Monitoring the hunting success rate of wolves (faunal) and the incidence of disease in beaver populations that also depend on aspen (floral).", "solution": "Goal clarification: The project aims to detect a trophic cascade initiated by wolf reintroduction that reduces elk pressure on young aspen, thereby increasing aspen recruitment and growth. The most direct evaluation must therefore measure (i) the wolf effect on elk (the key herbivore in this cascade) and (ii) the resulting response of aspen regeneration in areas previously limited by elk browsing.\n\nDirect causal chain: wolves affect elk demography and behavior (mortality/risk-sensitive foraging), which alters browsing intensity and spatial use, which then affects aspen sapling recruitment (number of stems establishing and surviving) and growth (height growth to escape the browse layer). Thus, the most informative indicators are those that quantify elk density and spatial distribution across risky vs safe habitats, and the recruitment and height of young aspen in sites formerly overgrazed.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A is not direct: the number of wolf packs does not measure elk response, and pine seed production is not the focal plant response of the elk-aspen interaction.\n- Option B is not direct: coyote populations are mesopredators and not the main herbivore or apex predator in this cascade; NDVI is broad, integrates many vegetation types, and is too coarse to specifically detect aspen sapling recovery from browsing.\n- Option C is direct: elk population density and spatial distribution are the primary faunal indicators of top-down control and risk-mediated habitat use; height and recruitment of young aspen saplings in previously overgrazed areas are the primary floral indicators of reduced browsing and recovery.\n- Option D is indirect and confounded: scavenger abundance tracks carrion availability rather than the elk-aspen interaction; soil nitrogen in aspen groves is influenced by many processes and is not the primary signal of release from browsing.\n- Option E is not direct to the focal interaction: wolf hunting success does not necessarily capture elk redistribution or browsing pressure; beaver disease incidence introduces unrelated confounders and is not a direct measure of aspen recovery from elk browsing.\n\nConclusion: The plan that most directly and effectively assesses the targeted wolf-elk-aspen cascade is to monitor elk density and distribution together with aspen sapling recruitment and height in previously overgrazed areas.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1878599"}, {"introduction": "Rewilding is not always about restoring an ecosystem to a single, obvious state; historical data can reveal surprising past landscapes, forcing a re-evaluation of project goals. This next exercise places you in a high-level strategic role, using a quantitative framework to compare two different rewilding strategies—afforestation versus restoring a wood-pasture savanna. You will learn to weigh competing criteria such as historical fidelity, biodiversity potential, and ecosystem services to make an evidence-based decision [@problem_id:1878617].", "problem": "The Veridian Basin Conservation Trust (VBCT) is planning to restore a large area of degraded ex-farmland. The initial plan, based on regional climatic potential, was `Strategy F`: a large-scale afforestation project to establish a closed-canopy deciduous forest. However, recent paleoecological analysis of sediment cores from the site, using pollen and microscopic charcoal data, has provided a surprising insight. The data strongly indicate that for centuries prior to agricultural conversion, the area was a dynamic wood-pasture savanna, characterized by a mosaic of open grassland and clusters of trees, likely maintained by now-extinct large herbivores.\n\nThis discovery has prompted the proposal of an alternative plan, `Strategy S`: a trophic rewilding project. This strategy aims to re-establish a savanna-like ecosystem by reintroducing large herbivore proxies (e.g., hardy cattle and horses) to manage the landscape through grazing and browsing.\n\nTo decide between the two strategies, the VBCT has developed a quantitative decision framework based on a \"Rewilding Success Index\" (RSI). The RSI is calculated as a weighted sum of normalized scores for four different criteria:\n\n$$RSI = w_{HF} \\cdot HF + w_{BP} \\cdot BP + w_{ESV} \\cdot ESV - w_{PC} \\cdot PC$$\n\nThe weights for each criterion are: $w_{HF} = 0.3$, $w_{BP} = 0.4$, $w_{ESV} = 0.2$, and $w_{PC} = 0.1$.\n\nThe calculation for each criterion's score is defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Historical Fidelity (HF)**: The paleoecological data established a historical baseline of $T_H = 0.30$ (30% tree cover) and $G_H = 0.70$ (70% open ground). The fidelity score is defined as $HF = 1 - D$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance in state space between a strategy's target vegetation fractions ($T_{strategy}$, $G_{strategy}$) and the historical baseline ($T_H$, $G_H$).

The score is calculated as $BP = \\alpha + \\gamma \\cdot \\beta$, with a beta-diversity weighting factor of $\\gamma = 0.5$.\n    *   `Strategy F` is predicted to have $\\alpha_F = 80$ and $\\beta_F = 15$.\n    *   `Strategy S` is predicted to have $\\alpha_S = 60$ and $\\beta_S = 90$.\n\n3.  **Ecosystem Service Value (ESV)**: This score is based on the long-term carbon sequestration potential. It is normalized by a reference value of $C_{ref} = 5 \\text{ tonnes/hectare}$.
