The jaguar (*Panthera onca*) is a large, territorial predator that requires extensive, undisturbed forest to hunt and reproduce. It tends to avoid the boundaries, or \"edges,\" of its forest habitat where it borders human-modified landscapes like farms or roads.\n\nThe organization has a budget to acquire a total of 4,000 square kilometers of forest. Two competing proposals are on the table:\n\n*   **Proposal A (Single Large):** Acquire one single, contiguous, and roughly square-shaped reserve of 4,000 square kilometers.\n*   **Proposal B (Several Small):** Acquire four separate, non-connected, and roughly square-shaped reserves, each being 1,000 square kilometers in area.

Proposal B is superior because having multiple populations protects the entire species from being wiped out by a single localized catastrophe, such as a disease outbreak.\n\nB. Proposal A is superior because it provides the maximum amount of \"core\" habitat, which is the interior area of the forest that is unaffected by negative edge effects from the surrounding agricultural land.\n\nC. Proposal B is superior because four smaller reserves will encompass a greater variety of environments and prey species than a single large one.\n\nD. Both proposals are essentially equivalent in their conservation value because the total area of protected forest is the same (4,000 square kilometers).\n\nE. Proposal A is superior because a single large population will have significantly more gene flow than four isolated populations, preventing inbreeding depression.", "solution": "We identify the key ecological requirements: jaguars are large, territorial, and edge-averse interior-forest predators. Therefore, the conservation objective should maximize interior or \"core\" habitat area and maintain connectivity to support movement and gene flow while minimizing edge effects.\n\nTo compare proposals using explicit geometric and algebraic reasoning, let the total protected area be $T$ and assume all reserves are square. Let the width of the edge-affected band be $w>0$.\n\nSingle large (Proposal A):\n- Side length $a = \\sqrt{T}$.\n- Core side length $a - 2 w$ (valid if $a > 2 w$).\n- Core area \n$$A_{1} = (a - 2 w)^{2} = a^{2} - 4 a w + 4 w^{2}.$$\n- Perimeter \n$$P_{1} = 4 a.$$\n\nSeveral small (Proposal B, four equal squares):\n- Side length of each $s = \\sqrt{T/4} = \\frac{a}{2}$.\n- Core side length per square $s - 2 w = \\frac{a}{2} - 2 w$ (valid if $\\frac{a}{2} > 2 w$).\n- Core area per square $(\\frac{a}{2} - 2 w)^{2}$; total over four squares \n$$A_{4} = 4 \\left(\\frac{a}{2} - 2 w\\right)^{2} = 4 \\left(\\frac{a^{2}}{4} - 2 a w + 4 w^{2}\\right) = a^{2} - 8 a w + 16 w^{2}.$$\n- Total perimeter \n$$P_{4} = 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\frac{a}{2} = 8 a.$$\n\nCore-area comparison:\n$$A_{1} - A_{4} = \\left(a^{2} - 4 a w + 4 w^{2}\\right) - \\left(a^{2} - 8 a w + 16 w^{2}\\right) = 4 a w - 12 w^{2} = 4 w \\left(a - 3 w\\right).$$\nFor any realistic edge width satisfying $a > 3 w$ (i.e., edge effects are a small fraction of reserve side length), we have $A_{1} > A_{4}$. Thus the single large reserve provides strictly more core habitat than the four smaller reserves for the same total area. This is also consistent with the perimeter comparison $P_{1} = 4 a < P_{4} = 8 a$, indicating fewer edges and weaker cumulative edge effects for the single large reserve.\n\nEcological implications:\n- Maximizing core interior habitat directly benefits an edge-averse interior species like the jaguar, supporting hunting, reproduction, and reduced human-wildlife conflict. This favors Proposal A.\n- Connectivity and gene flow are also greater in a single contiguous reserve than in four isolated reserves, reducing inbreeding risk and enhancing long-term viability. This consideration also favors Proposal A.\n- Arguments that multiple small reserves buffer against localized catastrophes (proposal A’s alternative) are undermined here by the lack of connectivity and by the increased exposure to edge-dominated conditions. \n- Claims that several small reserves capture more habitat diversity are not guaranteed in this scenario and are outweighed by the negative edge and fragmentation effects for an edge-averse apex predator.\n- Total area equivalence does not imply equivalent conservation value when edge effects and fragmentation are strong determinants of habitat quality.\n\nTherefore, the best assessment, most directly aligned with the jaguar’s edge-avoidance and need for interior habitat, is that Proposal A is superior because it maximizes core habitat and minimizes edge effects.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1852289"}, {"introduction": "The ecological impact of a fragmenting feature, like a highway, is not absolute—it is relative to the life history of the organism encountering it. A barrier that is a minor obstacle for one species can be an insurmountable wall for another, with profound consequences for gene flow and long-term population viability. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1852344] asks you to compare the genetic fate of two species with vastly different home range sizes, illustrating the critical principle of scale-dependence in fragmentation ecology.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying two mammal species in a large, contiguous temperate forest: the gray wolf (*Canis lupus*) and the woodland deer mouse (*Peromyscus maniculatus*). The regional gray wolf population utilizes an average home range of approximately 250 square kilometers per pack. In contrast, the woodland deer mouse has a much smaller home range, averaging about 0.5 hectares (where 1 hectare = 0.01 square kilometers). A new six-lane highway is constructed, bisecting the forest. The highway, including its cleared verges, creates a cleared corridor approximately 75 meters wide that is a significant barrier to movement for both species. Over several generations, this barrier is expected to impact the gene flow of the populations now living on opposite sides of the highway.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the long-term population-level genetic outcome for these two species as a direct result of the highway's construction?\n\nA. The wolf population is more likely to become genetically isolated because their larger home ranges increase the probability that an individual will encounter the highway barrier.\n\nB. Both populations will be equally and severely impacted, leading to rapid genetic isolation in both species because the highway is an absolute barrier to safe crossing for any terrestrial animal.\n\nC. The wolf population is more likely to become genetically isolated because their lower population density makes them more vulnerable to the effects of population subdivision and subsequent genetic drift.\n\nD. The deer mouse population is more likely to become genetically isolated because the width of the highway corridor is large relative to the species' typical dispersal distance and home range size.\n\nE. Neither population will experience significant genetic isolation because natural selection will quickly favor individuals in both species capable of successfully crossing the highway, restoring gene flow.", "solution": "We aim to predict how a linear barrier of width 75 meters affects long-term gene flow in two species with very different movement scales, using principles of dispersal ecology and population genetics.\n\nFirst, convert and compare spatial scales relevant to movement.\n- Deer mouse home range: given as 0.5 hectares with 1 hectare equal to 0.01 square kilometers, so\n$$A_{\\text{mouse}} = 0.5 \\times 0.01 = 0.005 \\text{ km}^{2}.$$\n- Wolf home range: given as\n$$A_{\\text{wolf}} = 250 \\text{ km}^{2}.$$\nFor an area $A$ approximated as a square, the characteristic linear dimension is $L = \\sqrt{A}$. Thus,\n$$L_{\\text{mouse}} = \\sqrt{0.005} \\text{ km}, \\quad L_{\\text{wolf}} = \\sqrt{250} \\text{ km}.$$\nThe barrier width is\n$$W = 75 \\text{ m} = 0.075 \\text{ km}.$$\nCompare barrier width to each species’ movement scale via the ratios\n$$\\frac{W}{L_{\\text{mouse}}} = \\frac{0.075}{\\sqrt{0.005}}, \\quad \\frac{W}{L_{\\text{wolf}}} = \\frac{0.075}{\\sqrt{250}}.$$\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{0.005} \\text{ km} = \\sqrt{5000} \\text{ m} \\approx 70.7 \\text{ m}$, so $\\frac{W}{L_{\\text{mouse}}} \\approx \\frac{75}{70.7} \\approx 1.06$, meaning the barrier width is on the order of, or slightly exceeds, the linear dimension of a typical deer mouse home range. For wolves, $\\sqrt{250} \\text{ km} \\approx 15.8 \\text{ km}$, so $\\frac{W}{L_{\\text{wolf}}} \\approx \\frac{0.075}{15.8} \\ll 1$, meaning the barrier is extremely narrow relative to typical wolf movement scales.\n\nSecond, translate movement scale to expected gene flow across the barrier. Let $m$ denote the per-generation migration rate (fraction of individuals that successfully move between sides). A barrier that is large relative to typical dispersal distance and home range greatly reduces $m$; a barrier that is small relative to dispersal distance reduces $m$ much less. Therefore, the same barrier width implies\n$$m_{\\text{mouse}} \\ll m_{\\text{wolf}}.$$\n\nThird, connect migration to genetic differentiation using standard population genetics. Under the island model approximation, equilibrium genetic differentiation satisfies\n$$F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{4 N_{e} m + 1},$$\nwhere $N_{e}$ is the effective population size and $m$ is the migration rate. Even if $N_{e}$ is large (as is typical for small rodents), if $m$ becomes very small due to the barrier, the product $N_{e} m$ can still be small enough to yield a large $F_{ST}$, indicating strong genetic differentiation and effective genetic isolation across the barrier. Conversely, even if $N_{e}$ is smaller (as for wolves), a relatively larger $m$ maintained by occasional successful long-distance crossings can keep $4 N_{e} m$ larger and $F_{ST}$ lower, thereby mitigating isolation.\n\nFourth, evaluate the given statements in light of these principles.\n- Option A is incorrect because frequent encounters with a barrier do not necessarily reduce gene flow; what matters is successful crossing. Given their large movement scale relative to $W$, wolves are more likely to maintain some $m$.\n- Option B is incorrect because the highway is not an absolute barrier to all terrestrial animals; the prompt states it is a significant barrier, not an absolute one.\n- Option C is misleading: while lower $N_{e}$ increases drift, genetic isolation across a barrier is governed chiefly by $m$ across that barrier. Given $W \\ll L_{\\text{wolf}}$, $m_{\\text{wolf}}$ is expected to remain higher than $m_{\\text{mouse}}$, making wolves less likely to become genetically isolated than mice in this context.\n- Option D is consistent with the scale analysis: $W$ is large relative to the deer mouse home range and typical dispersal, which strongly depresses $m$ and increases $F_{ST}$ across the barrier, making genetic isolation more likely.\n- Option E is incorrect: rapid evolution of highway-crossing ability is unlikely to restore gene flow quickly; highways impose high mortality and strong avoidance, reducing, not restoring, $m$ in the near term.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the deer mouse population is more likely to become genetically isolated across the highway due to the barrier’s width being large relative to its typical dispersal distance and home range size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1852344"}]}
