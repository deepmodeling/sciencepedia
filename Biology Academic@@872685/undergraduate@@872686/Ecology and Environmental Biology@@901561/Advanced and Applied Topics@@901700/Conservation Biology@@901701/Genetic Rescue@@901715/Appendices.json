Due to the small population size, they are concerned about the effects of both inbreeding and potential outbreeding if individuals from a genetically distinct population are introduced for genetic rescue. They propose a model for the fitness of an offspring, denoted by $W$, as a function of the genetic distance, $d$, between its parents. Genetic distance $d$ is a dimensionless positive metric, where $d=0$ signifies genetically identical parents.\n\nThe proposed fitness model is:\n$$\nW(d) = K \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha d)\\right) \\exp(-\\beta d)\n$$\nIn this model, $K$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$ are positive real constants that are characteristic of the species' genetics. The term $(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha d))$ represents the fitness gain from avoiding inbreeding depression by increasing heterozygosity, which saturates for large genetic distances. The term $\\exp(-\\beta d)$ represents the fitness cost from outbreeding depression, which arises from the breakdown of locally co-adapted gene complexes and becomes more severe as parents become more genetically divergent.\n\nTo guide the breeding program, the biologists need to determine the ideal level of genetic divergence between mates.
