The founding population of this program consists of 45 breeding adults. Genetic screening reveals that this group is composed of only 5 sexually mature males, with the remainder being sexually mature females.\n\nThe effective population size ($N_e$) is a crucial metric in conservation genetics, representing the size of a theoretical, idealized population that would experience the same amount of random genetic drift as the actual population under study. Given the unequal sex ratio in the Gilded Sun-wing Butterfly breeding program, calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for this founding group.

Since the total population consists of only males and females, we can find $N_f$ by subtracting the number of males from the total population:\n$N_f = N_{total} - N_m$\n$N_f = 45 - 5 = 40$\nSo, there are 40 breeding females.\n\nThe formula for calculating the effective population size ($N_e$) when there is an unequal sex ratio of breeding individuals is:\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 N_m N_f}{N_m + N_f}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $N_m$ and $N_f$ into this formula:\n$N_m = 5$\n$N_f = 40$\n\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 40}{5 + 40}$$\n\nWe perform the arithmetic in the numerator and the denominator:\nNumerator: $4 \\times 5 \\times 40 = 20 \\times 40 = 800$\nDenominator: $5 + 40 = 45$\n\nSo, the expression for $N_e$ becomes:\n$$N_e = \\frac{800}{45}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$N_e = 17.777...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

For three consecutive years of the cycle, environmental conditions are favorable, and the census population size is stable at 500 individuals. However, the fourth year of the cycle is marked by an unusually warm and dry summer, leading to a severe population crash where the census size drops to just 20 individuals.
