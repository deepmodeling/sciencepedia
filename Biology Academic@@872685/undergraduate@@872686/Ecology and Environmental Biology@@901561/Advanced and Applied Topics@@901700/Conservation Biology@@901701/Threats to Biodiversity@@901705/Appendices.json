By working through this scenario, you will gain hands-on experience in calculating a key biodiversity index and interpreting what it tells us about ecosystem health.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the impact of land-use change on local biodiversity. A pristine temperate wetland ecosystem is surveyed, and the plant community is found to consist of five dominant species. The ecologist records the number of individuals for each species in a representative plot. The plot is then hypothetically drained and converted for agricultural or silvicultural use. Two scenarios are considered: conversion to a rice paddy, a form of monoculture agriculture, and conversion to a commercial pine plantation. The ecologist projects the resulting plant communities for each scenario based on established land-use models.\n\nThe biodiversity of each community is quantified using the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index ($H'$), defined as:\n$$H' = - \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i)$$\nwhere $S$ is the total number of species in the community (species richness), and $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to the $i$-th species.\n\nThe survey and projection data for the three communities are as follows:\n\n**1. Original Wetland Community:**\n- Species A: 100 individuals\n- Species B: 85 individuals\n- Species C: 90 individuals\n- Species D: 110 individuals\n- Species E: 75 individuals\n\n**2. Projected Rice Paddy Community:**\n- Species R (Rice): 5000 individuals\n- Species W1 (Associated Weed): 50 individuals\n- Species W2 (Associated Weed): 30 individuals\n\n**3.

Let $\\Delta H'_{\\text{pine}}$ be the change in the index from the conversion of the wetland to a pine plantation.\n\nCalculate the difference between these two projected changes, i.e., find the value of $\\Delta H'_{\\text{paddy}} - \\Delta H'_{\\text{pine}}$.

In this ecosystem, a native plant, the Meadow Cup Plant (*Silphium integrifolium*), supports a stable population of the native Silverleaf Aphid (*Uroleucon lactucae*).

The spider's population density is directly determined by its food availability; the ecosystem can support one spider for every 250 Silverleaf Aphids.\n\nRecently, an invasive Crimson Grain Aphid (*Sitobion miscanthi*) has established itself, reaching a disruptive population density of 8000 individuals per square meter. Before any intervention, the native Silverleaf Aphid population was stable at 1500 individuals per square meter.\n\nTo control the invasive aphid, a non-native biological control agent, the Harlequin Ladybug (*Harmonia axyridis*), is introduced. The introduction is successful in controlling the pest, ultimately causing a 95% reduction in the Crimson Grain Aphid population. However, the Harlequin Ladybug is a generalist predator and also preys on the native Silverleaf Aphid. Analysis of the ladybug's feeding behavior reveals a consistent non-target impact: to achieve the observed reduction in the invasive aphid population, the ladybugs consume 1 native Silverleaf Aphid for every 10 invasive Crimson Grain Aphids they eliminate.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a new equilibrium after the ladybug's introduction, calculate the new population density of the native Goldenrod Crab Spider.

The producers are basal species and their survival is not dependent on other species within this model. This extinction process can cascade: the extinction of one species can lead to the extinction of another that depends on it, which can in turn cause further extinctions. An extinction that occurs as a consequence of a primary loss is called a \"secondary extinction.\"\n\nYou are to compare two different scenarios of species loss, each involving the initial removal of two species.\n\n**Scenario A (Targeted Loss):** A highly specific pathogen completely eliminates the two producer species, P3 and P4.
