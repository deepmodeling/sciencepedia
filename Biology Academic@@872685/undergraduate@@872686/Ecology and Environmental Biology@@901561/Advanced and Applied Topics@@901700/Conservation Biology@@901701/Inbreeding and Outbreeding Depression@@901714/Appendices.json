This capstone exercise places you in the role of a manager designing a \"genetic rescue\" plan for an isolated population. You will develop a mathematical model to determine the optimal level of gene flow, balancing the long-term benefits of reducing inbreeding depression against the immediate risks of outbreeding depression [@problem_id:1854411].", "problem": "A conservation biologist is developing a strategy for the genetic rescue of a small, isolated population of an endangered mammal. This target population suffers from significant residual inbreeding depression, a reduction in viability and reproduction due to high homozygosity. The proposed plan involves introducing individuals from a large, genetically diverse source population. However, this \"managed gene flow\" carries a risk of outbreeding depression, which can arise from two distinct mechanisms: the breakdown of locally adapted gene combinations (intrinsic depression) and the introduction of genes that are poorly suited to the local environment (extrinsic depression).\n\nTo find the right balance, the biologist models the mean population fitness in the first filial (F1) generation as a function of the proportion of migrants, $m$, introduced into the parental breeding pool. The model is based on the following assumptions, with a baseline fitness of 1 for a genetically optimal, locally adapted individual:\n\n1.  Mating within the augmented parental pool is random.\n2.  The resident population's fitness is lowered by a cost $C_I$ due to inbreeding depression. Offspring from a cross between two resident parents fully inherit this cost, having a fitness of $W_{RR} = 1 - C_I$.\n3.  The migrant individuals are from a population adapted to a different environment. Offspring from a cross between two migrant parents are not inbred but are poorly adapted to the local environment, incurring a fitness cost $O_{ext}$. Their fitness is $W_{MM} = 1 - O_{ext}$.\n4.  Offspring from a resident-migrant cross (F1 hybrids) benefit from \"hybrid vigor\" (heterosis), which completely masks the resident inbreeding depression. However, their fitness is penalized by intrinsic outbreeding depression (cost $O_{int}$) and by being partially maladapted to the local environment. As they carry half migrant genes, they incur half the extrinsic fitness cost. Their fitness is $W_{RM} = 1 - O_{int} - 0.5 O_{ext}$.\n\nBased on genetic analysis and field data, the biologist has estimated the fitness cost parameters as:\n-   Residual inbreeding depression cost, $C_I = 0.30$\n-   Intrinsic outbreeding depression cost, $O_{int} = 0.10$\n-   Extrinsic outbreeding depression cost, $O_{ext} = 0.30$\n\nCalculate the optimal proportion of migrants, $m_{opt}$, that should be introduced into the parental population to maximize the mean fitness of the subsequent generation.", "solution": "Let the fraction of residents in the parental pool be $1 - m$ and migrants be $m$.
