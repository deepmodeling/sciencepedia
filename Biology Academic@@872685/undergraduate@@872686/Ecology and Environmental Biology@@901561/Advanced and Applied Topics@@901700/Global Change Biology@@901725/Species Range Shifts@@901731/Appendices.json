One common and intuitive method is to track the change in the geographic centroid, or the center of mass, of all known occurrences over time.

They have access to two datasets of species occurrence records: a historical dataset compiled from museum collections and a modern dataset from a citizen science project. After processing the data, they calculate the geographic centroid (the average latitude and longitude) of all recorded occurrences for each time period.\n\nThe centroid for the historical period (1900-1950) is located at a latitude of $\\phi_H = 42.50^\\circ$ N and a longitude of $\\lambda_H = 75.00^\\circ$ W.\nThe centroid for the modern period (2000-2020) is located at a latitude of $\\phi_M = 43.25^\\circ$ N and a longitude of $\\lambda_M = 75.50^\\circ$ W.\n\nTo quantify the magnitude of this shift, the ecologist decides to calculate the straight-line distance between these two centroids. For this calculation, you can make a flat-Earth approximation, which is valid for this relatively small geographic scale.

We are given the initial and final coordinates (latitude and longitude) and the conversion factors from degrees to kilometers for both latitude and longitude. We can model this problem in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system, where one axis represents the North-South direction and the other represents the East-West direction.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the change in latitude and longitude in degrees.\nThe change in latitude, $\\Delta\\phi$, is the difference between the modern latitude, $\\phi_M$, and the historical latitude, $\\phi_H$.\n$$ \\Delta\\phi = \\phi_M - \\phi_H = 43.25^\\circ - 42.50^\\circ = 0.75^\\circ $$\nThis positive value indicates a northward shift.\n\nThe change in longitude, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is the difference between the modern longitude, $\\lambda_M$, and the historical longitude, $\\lambda_H$.

Instead, it is a dynamic demographic process, characterized by population expansion at the \"leading edge\" and contraction at the \"trailing edge.\" This practice delves into the contrasting population dynamics of these two fronts, exploring how factors like growth rate and age structure differ dramatically. Understanding these demographic signatures is essential for predicting a species' capacity to colonize new areas and its vulnerability to local extinction in its historical range.

Their age structures will be approximately stable and identical.\n\nD. Population N will be characterized by low dispersal rates and high population density. Population S will be characterized by high dispersal rates and low population density as individuals attempt to escape the deteriorating conditions.", "solution": "To determine the correct description of the two populations, we must analyze the ecological conditions at the leading and trailing edges of a species' shifting range and their effects on population dynamics.\n\nFirst, let's consider Population N at the leading (northern) edge. This edge is expanding into newly available, suitable habitat. In these frontier areas, the population density is typically low. The low density means that intraspecific competition for resources (like food and territory) is minimal. The newly suitable environment provides ample resources. This combination of abundant resources and low competition allows for high survival rates and high reproductive rates. Consequently, the per capita birth rate will exceed the per capita death rate, leading to a positive and often high population growth rate ($r > 0$). A population with a high growth rate is characterized by a large proportion of young individuals (juveniles and pre-reproductive subadults) resulting from successful reproduction. This is often described as a \"bottom-heavy\" age structure, typical of an expanding population. Furthermore, the process of colonization itself favors individuals with high dispersal ability, which are often younger adults.\n\nNext, let's consider Population S at the trailing (southern) edge. This edge is contracting because the environment is becoming increasingly unsuitable (e.g., too warm). The environmental stress negatively impacts the physiology of the voles, leading to lower survival rates (higher death rates) and reduced fecundity (lower birth rates). In this scenario, the per capita death rate will exceed the per capita birth rate, resulting in a negative population growth rate ($r < 0$). The population is in decline. With low reproductive success and potentially higher mortality among younger, more vulnerable age classes, the proportion of new individuals entering the population is low. The population's age structure will therefore shift towards being dominated by the remaining, older adults, some of whom may be in their post-reproductive years. This creates a \"top-heavy\" or constricted-base age structure, characteristic of a shrinking population.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\nA. This option reverses the characteristics. It incorrectly assigns a negative growth rate and an old age structure to the expanding Population N, and a positive growth rate and young age structure to the contracting Population S.\n\nB. This option correctly aligns with our analysis. It states that Population N (leading edge) will have a high positive growth rate ($r > 0$) and a young age structure. It also correctly states that Population S (trailing edge) will have a negative population growth rate ($r < 0$) and a relatively older age structure.\n\nC. This option is incorrect. A population growth rate near zero ($r \\approx 0$) signifies a stable population, typically one that has reached its carrying capacity ($K$) in a stable environment. The edges of a shifting range are, by definition, demographically unstable—one is growing and the other is shrinking.\n\nD. This option incorrectly describes dispersal and density. The leading edge (Population N) is characterized by *high* dispersal rates, as individuals colonize new areas, and *low* population density. The trailing edge (Population S) is contracting, and while some individuals may attempt to disperse, the overall dynamic is one of retreat, not expansion. The density is declining, but the dispersal is not the defining outward-bound characteristic it is at the leading edge.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is provided in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1882839"}, {"introduction": "While climate is a primary driver of species distributions, it is rarely the only factor at play.

Despite this, the tick's northward expansion has completely stalled at this river.\n\nA leading hypothesis for this abrupt halt is that the tick's expansion is not limited by its adult-stage host (the deer), but by the dispersal ability of its larval-stage host, the meadow vole (*Microtus pennsylvanicus*).
