The analysis requires correctly categorizing chemicals based on their composition and identifying their primary historical application. The key categories are Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are organic compounds containing only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine atoms; Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which contain carbon, hydrogen, chlorine, and fluorine atoms; and Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which contain only carbon, hydrogen, and fluorine atoms.\n\nYou are given the following list of three compounds:\n1.  $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ (Dichlorodifluoromethane)\n2.  $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ (Chlorodifluoromethane)\n3.  $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ (1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane)\n\nBased on the definitions provided, which of the following statements correctly classifies each compound and identifies a primary historical use for its class?\n\nA. $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ is an HCFC used as an industrial solvent; $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ is a CFC used as an aerosol propellant; $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ is an HFC used in fire suppression systems.\n\nB. $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ is a CFC used in modern air conditioning; $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ is an HCFC used as an aerosol propellant; $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ is an HFC used as a transitional refrigerant.\n\nC. $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ is a CFC used as an aerosol propellant; $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ is an HCFC used as a transitional refrigerant; $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ is an HFC used in modern air conditioning.\n\nD. $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ is an HFC used in modern air conditioning; $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ is an HCFC used as an industrial solvent; $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ is a CFC used as an aerosol propellant.\n\nE. $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ is a CFC used as an aerosol propellant; $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ is an HFC used as a transitional refrigerant; $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ is an HCFC used in modern air conditioning.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must classify each compound based on the atoms present in its chemical formula and then recall the primary historical use of that chemical class in the context of ozone-depleting substances. The problem provides the necessary definitions for each class of compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound step-by-step.\n\nStep 1: Analyze $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ (Dichlorodifluoromethane).\nThe chemical formula $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ indicates the presence of Carbon (C), Chlorine (Cl), and Fluorine (F) atoms. There are no Hydrogen (H) atoms. According to the problem's definition, an organic compound containing only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine is a Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Historically, CFCs like this one (also known as Freon-12) were widely used as refrigerants in refrigerators and car air conditioners, and as propellants in aerosol spray cans before their production was banned by the Montreal Protocol due to their high ozone-depleting potential. Thus, classifying it as a CFC used as an aerosol propellant is correct.\n\nStep 2: Analyze $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ (Chlorodifluoromethane).\nThe chemical formula $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ indicates the presence of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Fluorine (F), and Chlorine (Cl) atoms. According to the problem's definition, a compound containing all four of these elements is a Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC). HCFCs were introduced as transitional substitutes for CFCs. The presence of the hydrogen atom makes them less stable in the atmosphere, giving them a lower (but not zero) ozone-depleting potential compared to CFCs. They were used in similar applications, such as refrigeration and as blowing agents for foam insulation, during the phase-out period of CFCs. Therefore, classifying it as an HCFC used as a transitional refrigerant is correct.\n\nStep 3: Analyze $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ (1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane).\nThe chemical formula $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ indicates the presence of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Fluorine (F) atoms. There are no Chlorine (Cl) atoms. According to the problem's definition, a compound containing only carbon, hydrogen, and fluorine is a Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC). HFCs were developed as a next-generation replacement for both CFCs and HCFCs because the absence of chlorine means they have zero ozone-depleting potential. They are commonly used in modern refrigeration and air conditioning systems (e.g., in automobiles). Therefore, classifying it as an HFC used in modern air conditioning is correct.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the multiple-choice options.\nWe compare our analysis with the given options.\n- Option A incorrectly classifies $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ as an HCFC and $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ as a CFC.\n- Option B correctly classifies all three compounds but incorrectly matches their uses. CFCs are not used in modern air conditioning (HFCs are), and HCFCs were primarily refrigerants, not aerosol propellants (which were a major use of CFCs).\n- Option C correctly classifies $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ as a CFC and identifies a correct use (aerosol propellant). It correctly classifies $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ as an HCFC and identifies its correct role (transitional refrigerant). It correctly classifies $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ as an HFC and identifies a correct use (modern air conditioning). This option aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n- Option D incorrectly classifies $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ as an HFC and $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ as a CFC.\n- Option E correctly classifies $\\text{CCl}_2\\text{F}_2$ but incorrectly swaps the classifications for $\\text{CHF}_2\\text{Cl}$ (calling it an HFC) and $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{F}_4$ (calling it an HCFC).\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly classifies all three compounds and their primary uses is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1883938"}, {"introduction": "After identifying the substances involved, the next step is to quantify and compare their environmental damage.
