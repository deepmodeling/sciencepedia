Before any decisions about harvesting or conservation can be made, we must quantify the current state of the forest. This exercise introduces a fundamental field technique, point sampling, for estimating a key metric of forest density called basal area [@problem_id:1884683]. By working through this problem, you will learn how foresters efficiently translate simple field counts into a powerful, stand-level assessment of timber stocking and ecological condition.", "problem": "An ecologist is developing a sustainable management plan for a 50-hectare mixed hardwood forest. A key parameter for assessing forest health and productivity is the basal area per hectare, which measures the total cross-sectional area of tree stems at breast height per unit of land area.\n\nTo estimate this value, the ecologist employs a technique known as point sampling. Five sample points are randomly established throughout the forest. At each point, the ecologist uses a calibrated optical instrument called a wedge prism. The prism has a known Basal Area Factor (BAF) of 2.2 square meters per hectare. When viewing trees through the prism from a sample point, trees are tallied as \"in\" if their trunks appear to be horizontally displaced by more than their own width.\n\nThe counts of \"in\" trees recorded at the five sample points are as follows:\n- Point 1: 7 trees\n- Point 2: 10 trees\n- Point 3: 8 trees\n- Point 4: 12 trees\n- Point 5: 9 trees\n\nUsing this data, calculate the average basal area of the forest. Express your answer in square meters per hectare, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "In variable-radius point sampling with a wedge prism, each tallied tree represents a basal area contribution equal to the Basal Area Factor. Therefore, at a given point, the basal area per hectare estimate is $F N$, where $F$ is the BAF and $N$ is the count of \"in\" trees at that point. With $k$ independent sample points, the unbiased estimator of the stand basal area per hectare is the average over points:\n$$\n\\hat{G} = F \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} N_{i}.\n$$\n\nHere, $F=2.2$ square meters per hectare, $k=5$, and the counts are $N_{1}=7$, $N_{2}=10$, $N_{3}=8$, $N_{4}=12$, $N_{5}=9$. Compute the sample mean count:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{i=1}^{5} N_{i} = \\frac{7+10+8+12+9}{5} = \\frac{46}{5} = 9.2.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\hat{G} = 2.2 \\cdot 9.2 = 20.24.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $20.2$ in square meters per hectare. The total forest area of 50 hectares is not needed because the estimator already yields basal area per hectare.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20.2}$$", "id": "1884683"}, {"introduction": "Sustainable forestry is not just about ensuring there will be trees in the future, but also about maintaining their genetic quality. A common but shortsighted practice known as \"high-grading\"—harvesting only the biggest and best trees—can have hidden, long-term consequences.

The $GG$ and $Gg$ genotypes are phenotypically indistinguishable in terms of their desirability for harvest.\n\nInitially, the forest stand is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the frequency of the dominant allele $G$ is 0.6.\n\nA selective harvesting practice known as \"high-grading\" is implemented. This practice targets and removes the largest, most commercially valuable trees before they can contribute to the next generation's gene pool. The harvest is highly efficient, removing 100% of the homozygous dominant ($GG$) individuals and 50% of the heterozygous ($Gg$) individuals. The homozygous recessive ($gg$) individuals, being smaller and less valuable, are not harvested. The remaining trees ($gg$ individuals and the unharvested portion of $Gg$ individuals) are the only ones that will reproduce to form the next generation.\n\nAssuming random mating among the surviving trees, what is the frequency of the recessive \"poor growth\" allele ($g$) in the gene pool of the reproducing population that will seed the next generation?\n\nA) 0.30\n\nB) 0.40\n\nC) 0.56\n\nD) 0.70\n\nE) 0.84", "solution": "Let $p$ denote the initial frequency of the dominant allele $G$ and $q$ the initial frequency of the recessive allele $g$.

While trees are a renewable resource, the soil that supports them can be depleted, especially under intensive management practices like whole-tree harvesting.
