Their goal is to implement a policy that allows for the greatest possible harvest that can be sustained indefinitely, a strategy known as achieving the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). For a harvest to be sustainable, the rate at which scallops are removed from the population must be equal to the rate at which the population replenishes itself.\n\nTo implement this MSY strategy, harvesting must be managed to maintain the population at a specific, constant size.
