This practice [@problem_id:1840654] guides you through a more advanced analysis, using a logistic growth model to predict the long-term, population-level consequences of this new, persistent mortality source. By combining engineering specifications with principles of population ecology, you will calculate the new steady-state equilibrium for an insect population, gaining insight into the cascading effects of renewable energy infrastructure.", "problem": "An ecological impact assessment is underway for a new onshore wind farm. The farm consists of $N_{turbines} = 100$ identical turbines and is situated within a large, self-contained ecological reserve of area $A_{habitat} = 500 \\text{ km}^2$. A key concern is the impact on a local aerial insectivore bird species, which relies on a single dominant species of flying insect for its food.\n\nThe insect population is assumed to be uniformly mixed throughout a habitat volume defined by the reserve's area and an active airspace height of $h_{air} = 200 \\text{ m}$.
