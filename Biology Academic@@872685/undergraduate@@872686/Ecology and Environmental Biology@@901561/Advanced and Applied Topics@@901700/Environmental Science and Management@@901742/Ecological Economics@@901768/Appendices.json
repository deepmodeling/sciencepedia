A foundational practice in this field is quantifying a population's demand on nature against the environment's capacity to supply resources and absorb waste.

The Ecological Footprint (EF) quantifies this demand, representing the hypothetical area of biologically productive land and water required to produce the resources a population consumes and to absorb its waste. Conversely, a nation's Biocapacity (BC) represents the supply, measuring the actual productive area available within its borders. Both metrics are standardized into a common unit called a global hectare (gha), which represents a hectare with world-average biological productivity.\n\nConsider the hypothetical nation of Veridia. You are provided with the following data for a given year to assess its ecological balance.\n\n**National and per Capita Data:**\n*   Total Population of Veridia, $N = 50.0 \\times 10^6$ people.\n*   Total available cropland area, $A_{crop} = 30.0 \\times 10^6$ hectares.\n*   Total available grazing land area, $A_{graze} = 50.0 \\times 10^6$ hectares.\n*   Total available forest land area, $A_{forest} = 80.0 \\times 10^6$ hectares.\n*   Total available fishing grounds area, $A_{fish} = 15.0 \\times 10^6$ hectares.\n*   Per capita footprint for cropland products: $F_{crop, pc} = 0.50$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita footprint for grazing land products: $F_{graze, pc} = 0.20$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita footprint for forest products: $F_{forest, pc} = 0.30$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita footprint for fish and seafood: $F_{fish, pc} = 0.10$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita footprint for built-up land: $F_{built, pc} = 0.05$ hectares/person.\n*   Per capita carbon footprint (the land area needed to absorb CO2 emissions): $F_{carbon, pc} = 2.50$ hectares/person.\n\n**Standardization Factors:**\nTo convert physical hectares to global hectares, two types of factors are used:\n1.  **Yield Factor (YF)**: This dimensionless factor compares a country's national average yield for a given land type to the world average yield.\n2.  **Equivalence Factor (EQF)**: This dimensionless factor scales different land types according to their world-average biological productivity. For example, a cropland EQF of 2.5 means world-average cropland is 2.5 times more productive than a world-average hectare of all bioproductive land types combined.\n\nThe factors for Veridia and the world are as follows:\n| Land Type | Yield Factor (YF) for Veridia | Equivalence Factor (EQF) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Cropland | 1.20 | 2.51 |\n| Grazing Land | 0.90 | 0.45 |\n| Forest Land | 1.10 | 1.26 |\n| Fishing Grounds | 1.00 | 0.37 |\n| Built-up Land | N/A | 2.51 |\n| Carbon Footprint Land | N/A | 1.26 |\n\nCalculate Veridia's ecological balance, which is defined as its total biocapacity minus its total Ecological Footprint.
