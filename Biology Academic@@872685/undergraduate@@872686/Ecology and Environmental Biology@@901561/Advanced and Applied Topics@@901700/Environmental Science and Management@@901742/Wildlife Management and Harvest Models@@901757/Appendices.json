This exercise [@problem_id:1894548] provides hands-on practice in using basic demographic data—specifically age-specific survivorship ($l_x$) and fecundity ($m_x$)—to inform a strategic harvesting decision that targets the age class contributing least to the net reproductive rate, $R_0$.", "problem": "A wildlife management agency is tasked with developing a sustainable harvest plan for a population of a fictional mammal, the Alpine Woollyrat. The goal is to allow for a limited harvest while minimizing the impact on the population's long-term reproductive capacity. Ecologists have compiled a static life table for the female population, which is presented below.\n\nThe net reproductive rate, $R_0$, represents the average number of female offspring a female produces in her lifetime. It is calculated by summing the contributions from each age class: $R_0 = \\sum l_x m_x$. The individual term for each age class, $l_x m_x$, represents the average number of female offspring produced by a female at that specific age, accounting for the probability she survives to that age. A logical harvesting strategy to minimize demographic impact is to target the age class which contributes the least to the overall $R_0$.\n\nUsing the life table data provided, identify the reproductive age class (i.e., any age class $x$ where $m_x > 0$) that should be targeted for harvest.
