To monitor the bacterial population density in their liquid culture, they use two methods. The first is a direct, but time-consuming, viable plate count which determines the number of Colony Forming Units per milliliter (CFU/mL). The second is a rapid measurement of the culture's Optical Density (OD) at a wavelength of 600 nm using a spectrophotometer.\n\nTo establish a reliable correlation between the fast OD measurement and the accurate CFU/mL count, the team prepares a series of dilutions from a stock culture and measures both parameters for each dilution.

This exercise [@problem_id:2281051] explores a classic trade-off where the production of a protective polysaccharide capsule (S-type) incurs a metabolic burden, leading to a slower growth rate compared to a non-encapsulated mutant (R-type). By calculating the outcome of their competition over time, you can quantify how a small difference in generation time can lead to a dramatic shift in population structure.", "problem": "In many bacterial species, a common phenotypic variation observed in laboratory cultures is the transition between smooth (S-type) and rough (R-type) colony morphologies. The S-type phenotype is typically conferred by the production of an extracellular polysaccharide capsule, which is absent in the R-type variants. This capsule, while offering protection in certain environments, represents a significant metabolic cost to the cell.\n\nConsider a wild-type (S-type) bacterium and a mutant (R-type) derived from it.

Both strains are grown together in a rich liquid medium where nutrients are not a limiting factor for the duration of the experiment.\n\nAssume the rate of biomass synthesis for both strains is limited by a common intracellular process, and thus the time required for a cell to divide (the generation time) is directly proportional to the total new dry mass that must be synthesized for that division. The dry mass of the capsule produced by an S-type cell is 15.0% of the dry mass of the cell itself. The R-type strain, free from the burden of capsule synthesis, has a generation time of 20.0 minutes.\n\nIf a culture is inoculated with an equal number of S-type and R-type bacteria, calculate the ratio of the number of R-type bacteria to S-type bacteria ($N_R / N_S$) after the culture has been growing for exactly 5.00 hours.
