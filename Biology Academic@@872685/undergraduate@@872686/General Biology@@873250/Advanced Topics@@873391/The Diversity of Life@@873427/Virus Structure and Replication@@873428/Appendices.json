This new virion is assembled using two well-characterized parent viruses: Virus A and Virus B.\n\n- **Virus A** is an animal virus whose native host range is restricted to human pancreatic beta cells. It achieves this specificity via proteins in its outer capsid that bind to unique receptors on the surface of these human cells.\n- **Virus B** is a plant virus that exclusively infects cells in the leaves of the tomato plant (*Solanum lycopersicum*). Its genetic material is a single strand of RNA that codes for its own set of viral proteins.\n\nThe hybrid virus is constructed with the complete protein capsid of Virus A and the complete RNA genome of Virus B.\n\nAssuming this hybrid virus is introduced to a mixed culture containing both human pancreatic beta cells and tomato leaf cells, which of the following outcomes is expected?\n\nA.

Denote the capsid proteins by $P_{\\text{capsid}}$ and the host receptor(s) by $R$. Infection requires specific binding, modeled conceptually as $P_{\\text{capsid}}^{A}$ matching $R_{\\text{human}\\ \\beta\\text{-cell}}$, while failing to match $R_{\\text{tomato leaf}}$, and also requires overcoming structural barriers such as the plant cell wall. By the problem statement, Virus A’s capsid proteins specifically bind human pancreatic beta cell receptors and not plant cells. Therefore, a hybrid with the complete capsid of Virus A will attach to and enter human pancreatic beta cells but will not attach to or enter tomato leaf cells.\n\n2) The proteins synthesized after entry are determined by the viral genome present in the particle. Let the genome be $G$ and the set of proteins encoded be $S(G)$. Because the hybrid carries the complete RNA genome of Virus B, the set of viral proteins produced after successful entry is $S(G_{B})$, i.e., the proteins of Virus B. The identity of the capsid does not alter which proteins are encoded and expressed; it only dictates which cells can be infected.\n\nApplying these principles:\n\n- Entry step: The hybrid’s $P_{\\text{capsid}}^{A}$ binds $R_{\\text{human}\\ \\beta\\text{-cell}}$, enabling infection of human pancreatic beta cells. It cannot infect tomato leaf cells because it lacks the necessary plant-specific entry mechanisms and cannot overcome the plant cell wall, and it lacks matching receptors on plant cells.\n\n- Expression step: Once inside a human pancreatic beta cell, the genome $G_{B}$ directs synthesis of Virus B proteins, i.e., the cell will produce the proteins encoded by Virus B’s RNA.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Incorrect. Entry into tomato leaf cells fails due to the capsid of Virus A; synthesis of Virus A proteins would also be incorrect because the genome is from Virus B.\n- B: Incorrect. Entry into human beta cells is correct, but synthesis of Virus A proteins is incorrect because the genome is Virus B.\n- C: Incorrect. Entry into tomato leaf cells fails.\n- D: Correct. The hybrid infects human pancreatic beta cells (capsid of A) and synthesizes Virus B proteins (genome of B).\n- E: Incorrect. It can infect human pancreatic beta cells.\n- F: Incorrect. It cannot infect tomato leaf cells, and in any infected cell the proteins synthesized are from Virus B only.\n\nThus, the expected outcome is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2325549"}, {"introduction": "Virologists often visualize the destructive power of viruses using a plaque assay, where zones of cell death appear on a lawn of bacteria. However, these plaques are not all alike, and their appearance can tell a story about the virus's life strategy. This exercise challenges you to think like an experimentalist, interpreting macroscopic patterns—clear versus cloudy plaques—to deduce the underlying microscopic life cycle of a bacteriophage [@problem_id:2325516].", "problem": "A microbiology student is tasked with characterizing two newly isolated bacteriophages, designated Phage A and Phage B, which infect the same strain of *Escherichia coli*. The student prepares two separate agar plates, each with a uniform \"lawn\" of susceptible *E. coli*. A small volume of a Phage A suspension is added to the center of the first plate, and a small volume of a Phage B suspension is added to the center of the second plate. After overnight incubation, the student observes the formation of plaques, which are zones of clearing in the bacterial lawn caused by phage-induced cell death.\n\nThe student makes the following observations:\n1.  The plate with Phage A shows plaques that are perfectly clear and sharply defined.\n2.  The plate with Phage B shows plaques that are turbid, or cloudy, especially in their centers.\n\nBased on the distinct appearance of the plaques, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the life cycles of these two phages?\n\nA. Phage A is temperate, and Phage B is lytic. The turbidity in Phage B's plaques is caused by incomplete lysis of the host cells.\n\nB. Phage A is lytic, and Phage B is temperate. The turbidity in Phage B's plaques is caused by the growth of phage-immune, lysogenic bacteria within the plaque area.\n\nC. Both Phage A and Phage B are lytic, but Phage A has a faster replication cycle, which results in more complete clearing of the bacteria.\n\nD. Both Phage A and Phage B are temperate, but Phage A has a defect in its ability to establish lysogeny, causing it to behave like a lytic phage.\n\nE. Phage A is lytic, and Phage B is temperate. The turbidity in Phage B's plaques is an artifact caused by a lower initial concentration of Phage B.", "solution": "Plaques are zones of bacterial death in a lawn of susceptible bacteria resulting from phage infection and spread. The optical appearance of plaques reflects the life cycle of the infecting phage.\n\nA strictly lytic phage infects, replicates, and lyses its host in every infection event. This leads to uniform killing within the plaque area and produces plaques that are clear and sharply defined, because few or no viable bacteria remain within the plaque.\n\nA temperate phage can follow either the lytic cycle or establish lysogeny by integrating into the host genome. Lysogens express a phage-encoded repressor that prevents superinfection by the same phage and allows the bacterial host to survive and grow. Within a plaque initiated by a temperate phage, some cells become lysogens and continue to grow slowly within the plaque area, producing turbidity, often most evident in the centers where infection occurred earliest and lysogens have had the most time to accumulate. Thus, turbid plaques are characteristic of temperate phages.\n\nApplying these principles:\n- The perfectly clear, sharply defined plaques of Phage A indicate obligate lytic behavior.\n- The turbid plaques of Phage B, especially with cloudy centers, indicate a temperate phage producing lysogens that grow within the plaque.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because it reverses the identities; turbidity is not caused by incomplete lysis but by lysogen growth.\n- Option B is correct: Phage A is lytic, and Phage B is temperate; turbidity arises from phage-immune lysogenic bacteria within the plaque.\n- Option C is incorrect: Differences in replication speed between lytic phages do not create turbidity; turbidity reflects surviving lysogens.\n- Option D is incorrect: It asserts both are temperate, which is not supported; the simplest interpretation is that Phage A is lytic.\n- Option E is incorrect: Initial phage concentration primarily affects plaque number and size, not the intrinsic turbidity pattern, which is due to lysogeny.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Phage A is lytic and Phage B is temperate, with turbidity due to growth of lysogenic, phage-immune bacteria within the plaque.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2325516"}, {"introduction": "A successful viral infection is not a chaotic takeover but a precisely orchestrated temporal program of gene expression. To ensure all components are ready at the right time, viruses have evolved sophisticated genetic circuits. This final challenge is a logic puzzle that asks you to piece together a functional regulatory network [@problem_id:2325554], revealing how a few simple activators and repressors can enforce a strict sequence of events and safeguard the replication process.", "problem": "A virologist is studying the transcriptional regulatory network of a newly discovered large bacteriophage. The phage genome exhibits a clear temporal organization into three gene classes: Early (E), Middle (M), and Late (L). The Late gene class contains the gene responsible for host cell lysis. To ensure successful replication, the phage must enforce a strict sequence of gene expression (E, then M, then L), shut down early gene expression after the middle phase begins, and include a robust safeguard against premature cell lysis.\n\nBased on sequence analysis, the virologist has identified the following fixed promoter logic and a set of three mobile regulatory genes encoding proteins A, B, and R. The task is to determine how these regulatory genes must be distributed between the Early and Middle gene classes to create a functional circuit.\n\n**Fixed Network Properties:**\n1.  **Promoter Logic:**\n    *   **Early (E) Promoters:** Recognized and transcribed by the host's native RNA polymerase immediately upon DNA injection.\n    *   **Middle (M) Promoters:** Are completely silent until activated by the binding of **Protein A**.\n    *   **Late (L) Promoters:** Are completely silent unless **both Protein A and Protein B** are simultaneously bound (functioning as a logical AND gate).\n2.  **Regulatory Proteins:**\n    *   **Protein A:** A transcriptional activator.\n    *   **Protein B:** A transcriptional activator.\n    *   **Protein R:** A transcriptional repressor that specifically binds to and silences all Early (E) promoters.\n\n**The Challenge:**\nYou must select the network architecture that correctly arranges the coding sequences for proteins A, B, and R within the phage's gene classes. Which of the following assignments of genes to classes creates a temporal program that meets all the phage's requirements: (1) strict E → M → L expression order, (2) shutdown of E-gene expression after M-gene activation, and (3) a robust delay mechanism preventing premature activation of L-class genes?\n\nA. The Early (E) gene class encodes Protein A. The Middle (M) gene class encodes Protein B and Protein R.\n\nB. The Early (E) gene class encodes Protein A and Protein B. The Middle (M) gene class encodes Protein R.\n\nC. The Early (E) gene class encodes Protein R. The Middle (M) gene class encodes Protein A and Protein B.\n\nD. The Early (E) gene class encodes Protein A and Protein R. The Middle (M) gene class encodes Protein B.", "solution": "We use the fixed promoter logic and regulatory functions to constrain feasible placements of genes A, B, and R across the Early (E) and Middle (M) classes.\n\nStep 1: Ensure that Middle (M) can be activated.\nBy the fixed property, M promoters are completely silent until activated by Protein A. Therefore, Protein A must be present before any M-gene transcription can occur. Since only E promoters are transcribed immediately upon injection by the host RNA polymerase, Protein A must be encoded in the E class. Any architecture placing A only in M cannot start M at all (because M requires A to be active first). This eliminates option C.\n\nStep 2: Prevent premature activation of Late (L) genes as a robust safeguard against early lysis.\nBy the fixed property, L promoters require the simultaneous presence of both A and B (logical AND). Since A must be present early (from Step 1), to prevent L from being active during the early phase, B must not be present in E. Therefore, B must be in M. Any architecture placing B in E would allow L to activate prematurely when both A and B are present early. This eliminates option B.\n\nStep 3: Enforce shutdown of Early (E) expression after the Middle (M) phase begins.\nBy the fixed property, Protein R represses all E promoters. To ensure that E shuts down after M begins (not before), R must be produced as a consequence of M activation. Therefore, R should be encoded in M, not in E. If R were in E, it could repress E before M is activated, risking failure to accumulate sufficient A to start M and violating the requirement that shutdown occurs after M begins. This eliminates option D.\n\nStep 4: Verify that the remaining architecture satisfies all requirements.\nThe remaining option is A: E encodes A; M encodes B and R.\n- Strict E → M → L order: E turns on immediately and produces A; A activates M; M produces B; once both A and B are present, L can activate. Thus L activation is downstream of M activation.\n- Shutdown of E after M begins: R is encoded in M, so its production starts only after M is activated by A; R then represses all E promoters, shutting down E after M has begun.\n- Robust safeguard against premature lysis: L requires both A and B. Early phase has only A present; B is in M and only appears after M activation, so L cannot activate prematurely.\n\nTherefore, option A uniquely satisfies all three constraints mechanistically.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2325554"}]}
