{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The plaque assay is a cornerstone technique in virology, providing a visual window into the microscopic battle between phages and bacteria. The appearance of a plaque is not random; it is a direct reflection of the phage's life cycle strategy. This practice challenges you to interpret these macroscopic patterns—the clear zones of death versus the cloudy signs of coexistence—to deduce the fundamental biological differences between lytic and temperate phages [@problem_id:2301337].", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying two newly isolated bacteriophages, which they name Phage Alpha and Phage Gamma. To characterize them, the researcher performs a plaque assay. A culture of susceptible host bacteria is used to create a uniform bacterial lawn on an agar plate. Dilutions of Phage Alpha and Phage Gamma are then spotted onto different areas of the lawn. After incubation, the plate is examined. The area infected with Phage Alpha shows distinct, completely clear plaques. In contrast, the area infected with Phage Gamma shows plaques that are turbid, or cloudy, in their center. A plaque is a zone on the bacterial lawn where bacteria have been killed by phage infection and lysis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate biological explanation for the difference between the clear plaques of Phage Alpha and the turbid plaques of Phage Gamma?\n\nA. Phage Gamma has a significantly smaller burst size than Phage Alpha, resulting in an insufficient number of progeny phages to lyse all the bacteria in the plaque area.\n\nB. The host bacteria evolved rapid resistance to Phage Gamma but not to Phage Alpha, allowing resistant cells to grow within the Phage Gamma plaques.\n\nC. Phage Gamma is a temperate phage capable of lysogeny, and the turbidity is caused by the growth of phage-immune, lysogenic bacteria within the plaque.\n\nD. Phage Alpha is a temperate phage that is exclusively locked in the lytic cycle under these conditions, while Phage Gamma is a virulent phage that lyses cells less efficiently.\n\nE. The turbidity in Phage Gamma plaques is an artifact caused by the precipitation of viral proteins, which are less dense than the surrounding bacterial lawn.", "solution": "We analyze the biological mechanism that determines plaque appearance. A plaque is a zone where phage infection has lysed host bacteria. Clear plaques indicate that essentially all infected cells undergo lysis; turbid plaques indicate that some cells within the plaque remain viable and continue to grow.\n\nPrinciple 1: Virulent (strictly lytic) phages infect, replicate, and lyse host cells, leading to areas devoid of live bacteria, which appear clear.\n\nPrinciple 2: Temperate phages can undergo either the lytic cycle or lysogeny. In lysogeny, the phage genome integrates or persists in the host, and a phage-encoded repressor establishes immunity to superinfection by the same phage. Lysogenic bacteria can grow within the region seeded by infection, producing a cloudy (turbid) appearance.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A: A smaller burst size affects the number of progeny and may reduce plaque size or edge sharpness, but does not inherently allow substantial bacterial growth within the plaque center; thus, it does not explain sustained turbidity caused by viable, growing cells.\n- B: Rapid evolution of resistance could allow growth, but resistance events are rare and typically appear as distinct resistant colonies rather than uniform turbidity within many plaques. Moreover, this does not systematically differentiate Alpha versus Gamma unless Gamma uniquely selects resistance, which is not implied.\n- C: If Phage Gamma is temperate, some infected cells become lysogens expressing a repressor that confers superinfection immunity. These lysogens survive and replicate within the plaque area, causing turbidity. This is the classic explanation for turbid plaques (e.g., phage lambda).\n- D: This inverts the expected relationship. Clear plaques align with a virulent (lytic) phage (Phage Alpha), whereas turbid plaques align with a temperate phage (Phage Gamma). Thus the statement is incorrect.\n- E: Protein precipitation is not a recognized cause of plaque turbidity; plaque morphology reflects bacterial viability, not protein density artifacts.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that Phage Gamma is temperate and produces lysogens that grow within the plaque, causing turbidity, while Phage Alpha is lytic and produces clear plaques.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2301337"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple observation, a core skill in molecular biology is the ability to manipulate and select for specific genetic outcomes. This exercise simulates a common laboratory task: isolating bacteria that have been successfully lysogenized by an engineered phage. To succeed, you must think like an experimental designer, developing a protocol that leverages the distinct fates of uninfected, lytically infected, and lysogenically infected cells to purify the desired population [@problem_id:2301344].", "problem": "An experimental biologist is working with a strain of *E. coli* that is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. They have a sample of a temperate bacteriophage, which has been genetically engineered to carry a gene conferring ampicillin resistance ($amp^R$). The biologist's goal is to create and isolate a pure culture of *E. coli* lysogens, where the prophage carrying the $amp^R$ gene is stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nThey perform an initial infection by mixing a high concentration of the engineered phage with a liquid culture of the ampicillin-sensitive *E. coli*. After a short incubation period to allow for phage adsorption and DNA injection, they need to select for the bacteria that have become lysogens.\n\nWhich of the following experimental protocols is the most effective method for isolating the desired *E. coli* lysogens from the infection mixture?\n\nA. Immediately plate the infection mixture onto a nutrient agar plate containing ampicillin. The colonies that grow are the lysogens.\n\nB. Plate the infection mixture onto a standard nutrient agar plate without any antibiotic. After colonies grow, use replica plating to transfer them to a second plate containing ampicillin. The colonies that grow on the ampicillin plate are the lysogens.\n\nC. Add DNase enzyme to the infection mixture to degrade any external phage DNA, then immediately plate the mixture onto a nutrient agar plate containing ampicillin.\n\nD. Incubate the infection mixture in liquid nutrient broth for a period longer than the phage's lytic cycle latent period (e.g., several hours), and then plate a sample of the culture onto nutrient agar containing ampicillin. The colonies that grow are the lysogens.\n\nE. Treat the infection mixture with a strong detergent to lyse all the bacteria. Then, filter and collect the released prophages and use them to infect a new, fresh culture of bacteria.", "solution": "The goal is to isolate bacteria that have stably integrated the phage DNA (lysogens) and thus acquired ampicillin resistance. We must devise a strategy that selects for these cells while eliminating all other cells: uninfected bacteria and bacteria undergoing the lytic cycle.\n\nLet's analyze the possible fates of the bacteria in the initial mixture:\n1.  **Uninfected Bacteria**: These cells did not get infected by a phage. They remain sensitive to ampicillin.\n2.  **Lytically Infected Bacteria**: The phage has injected its DNA, and the cell is now programmed to produce new phages. This process will end with the cell lysing (bursting) and dying. The time from infection to lysis is the latent period.\n3.  **Lysogenically Infected Bacteria (Lysogens)**: The phage has injected its DNA, and the DNA has integrated into the bacterial chromosome to become a prophage. The bacterium survives, is now called a lysogen, and carries the ampicillin resistance gene ($amp^R$). This cell and its descendants will be resistant to ampicillin.\n\nNow, we evaluate each protocol:\n\n**A. Immediately plate on ampicillin:** This method is flawed. While it will kill uninfected, ampicillin-sensitive bacteria, it fails to account for two issues. First, the plate will contain a very high concentration of free phage particles, which can infect and lyse bacteria as they try to form colonies, leading to the formation of plaques (clear zones) and making it difficult to isolate pure colonies. Second, cells that are already committed to the lytic cycle have not yet lysed. They may have had time to express the $amp^R$ gene and might survive on the plate for a short time, but they will not form stable colonies, confusing the results.\n\n**B. Replica plating:** This protocol is inefficient. The initial plate contains no antibiotic, so both uninfected cells and lysogens will grow. Since the frequency of lysogeny is typically low, the vast majority of colonies will be uninfected, ampicillin-sensitive cells. Using replica plating to find the few resistant colonies among thousands of sensitive ones is extremely laborious and not an effective selection method.\n\n**C. Add DNase then plate:** This protocol is based on a misunderstanding of phage structure. A bacteriophage protects its genetic material (DNA or RNA) inside a protein capsid. Extracellular DNase can only degrade \"naked\" DNA in the medium; it cannot penetrate the protein capsid to destroy the DNA within the infectious phage particles. Therefore, this step has no effect on the outcome and suffers from the same problems as protocol A.\n\n**D. Incubate, then plate on ampicillin:** This is the most effective strategy. The initial incubation in nutrient broth (without ampicillin) for several hours serves a crucial purpose. This time is longer than the phage's latent period, allowing any bacteria that entered the lytic cycle to complete the process and lyse. This effectively removes them from the population of viable cells. During this time, the stable lysogens, which are now ampicillin-resistant, will survive and multiply. After this \"enrichment\" period, the culture is plated on ampicillin agar. Any remaining uninfected cells are killed by the ampicillin. Only the lysogens, which are resistant and have increased in number, will be able to grow and form distinct colonies. This combination of enrichment (by waiting for lysis) and selection (with ampicillin) is a powerful and standard method for isolating lysogens.\n\n**E. Lyse and collect prophages:** This protocol is fundamentally incorrect. A \"prophage\" is the state of the phage's genetic material when it is integrated into the host's chromosome. It is not an independent, infectious particle. Lysing the cells would release newly assembled phage virions from cells that underwent the lytic cycle, not \"prophages\". This procedure would fail to isolate lysogens and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the lysogenic cycle.\n\nTherefore, protocol D is the correct and most robust method.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2301344"}, {"introduction": "The decision to become a lysogen involves complex biological trade-offs for both the phage and its host. This practice moves from qualitative description to quantitative reasoning, asking you to construct a simple mathematical model of a lysogenic population's growth. By translating biological concepts—such as the metabolic cost of carrying a prophage ($c$) and the risk of spontaneous lytic induction ($\\lambda$)—into a formal expression for the net growth rate ($\\mu_{\\text{net}}$), you can gain a deeper understanding of the fitness consequences of the lysogenic lifestyle [@problem_id:2301318].", "problem": "A population of lysogenic bacteria carries a dormant prophage within its genome. The growth dynamics of this population are influenced by the phage's presence. The maximal specific growth rate of the corresponding uninfected bacterial strain, under a given set of ideal environmental conditions, is denoted by $\\mu_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nThe prophage imposes a constant metabolic burden on its host cell. This burden results in a reduction of the host's specific growth rate by a fractional amount, represented by a dimensionless fitness cost coefficient, $c$, where $0 < c < 1$.\n\nFurthermore, the prophage can spontaneously reactivate and enter the lytic cycle, a process which invariably leads to the lysis and death of the host cell.
