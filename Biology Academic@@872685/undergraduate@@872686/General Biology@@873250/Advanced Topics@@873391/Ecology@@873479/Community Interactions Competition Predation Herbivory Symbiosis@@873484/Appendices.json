This relationship, however, involves a trade-off. While pollinating, the moth lays eggs in the plant's flowers, and its larvae consume a portion of the developing seeds.\n\nConsider a specific yucca plant that produces $N_f$ flowers. Each flower contains $N_o$ ovules, which can develop into seeds upon successful fertilization. Without the moth's intervention, none of the ovules are fertilized. When a yucca moth interacts with the plant, its pollination activities are effective enough to fertilize a fraction, $f_p$, of the total available ovules across all flowers.\n\nSimultaneously, the moth imposes a cost by laying one egg in each of the $N_f$ flowers.
