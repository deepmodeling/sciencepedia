Community Alpha is located in a protected, old-growth forest, while Community Beta is in an area that was clear-cut 15 years ago and is now undergoing secondary succession. The ecologist conducts a census and records the number of individuals for each plant species present. Both communities are found to contain exactly 10 species.\n\nThe abundance data are as follows:\n- **Community Alpha**: The number of individuals for the 10 species are 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 20, 19, 18, 17, and 16.\n- **Community Beta**: The number of individuals for the 10 species are 105, 30, 15, 11, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3.\n\nTo quantify and compare the diversity of these two communities, you will use two standard ecological indices. The Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, $H$, is calculated as:\n$$H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i)$$\nwhere $S$ is the species richness (the total number of species), and $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to the $i$-th species.\n\nThe species evenness can be measured by Pielou's Evenness Index, $J$, which is calculated as:\n$$J = \\frac{H}{H_{\\text{max}}}$$\nwhere $H_{\\text{max}} = \\ln(S)$. This index $J$ is constrained between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a situation where all species are present in equal numbers.\n\nBased on an analysis of these two communities using the provided data and formulae, which of the following statements provides the most accurate ecological interpretation?\n\nA. Community Alpha exhibits lower evenness than Community Beta, a pattern consistent with niche preemption by a dominant competitor in stable environments.\n\nB. Community Beta is more diverse and more even than Community Alpha, which is characteristic of a mid-successional stage where competitive exclusion has not yet occurred.\n\nC. The strong dominance by one species and resulting low evenness in Community Beta are characteristic of an early successional community recovering from a major disturbance.\n\nD. The high evenness observed in Community Alpha suggests a lack of significant interspecific competition, allowing many species to coexist at similar population sizes.\n\nE. A valid comparison is impossible because the total number of individuals sampled in Community Alpha is different from that in Community Beta.", "solution": "We are given two communities, each with species richness $S=10$, and species-abundance counts.

The primary food source for brush rabbits consists of grasses and forbs, while sage-grouse primarily consume sagebrush leaves and insects. There is no significant overlap in their dietary needs or nesting sites. Both species are preyed upon by the red-tailed hawk. Following several unusually mild winters and wet springs, botanists observe a significant boom in the growth of grasses, leading to a subsequent, dramatic increase in the brush rabbit population.

Both are preyed upon by the red-tailed hawk. After a resource-driven boom in grasses, the rabbit population increases dramatically. Subsequently, despite continued sagebrush abundance, the sage-grouse population declines.\n\nTo identify the best ecological principle explaining the grouse decline, proceed by evaluating the mechanisms implied by each option against the known conditions and standard definitions:\n\n1. For exploitative competition to apply (Option A), two species must share a limiting resource that is consumed or used, thereby reducing its availability to the other. The problem explicitly states no overlap in dietary needs or nesting sites. Although one might posit a shared, non-food resource such as generalized shelter, there is no evidence that rabbits deplete a specific, limiting, non-food resource necessary for sage-grouse. Furthermore, sage-grouse and rabbits use different structural habitats (ground-dwelling mammal burrows or cover vs. avian lekking and nesting requirements), weakening this mechanism. Therefore, exploitative competition does not match the scenario.\n\n2. Trophic cascade (Option B) typically refers to top-down effects across multiple trophic levels where changes at a higher trophic level propagate to lower levels, often resulting in alternating increases and decreases across levels. A bottom-up increase in primary production led to a rabbit boom, which could increase predator abundance. However, the specific phrasing about “destabilized” hawk populations and “erratic and intensified hunting” is not required to produce the observed effect. The essential mechanism at play is a shared-predator effect where increased prey density supports more predators, elevating predation pressure on another prey species. This is more precisely captured by apparent competition rather than labeled broadly as a trophic cascade.\n\n3. Apparent competition (Option C) occurs when two prey species that do not compete for resources are linked indirectly through a shared predator. An increase in one prey population supports a higher predator density, which increases predation pressure on the other prey, potentially causing its decline even when its own resources are abundant. This mechanism exactly fits the observations: rabbit boom → increased hawk density → elevated predation on sage-grouse → grouse decline despite abundant sagebrush.\n\n4. Amensalism (Option D) would require that one species is harmed while the other is unaffected, typically via direct, non-trophic mechanisms (e.g., chemical inhibition or accidental habitat degradation), or a disease spread where the actor is unaffected. The problem provides no evidence of disease or direct rabbit-caused harm to sage-grouse. Moreover, the core dynamic involves predators benefiting from increased rabbits, which is outside amensalism.\n\nBy elimination and by positive alignment with standard definitions, the most accurate explanation is apparent competition via a shared predator: the rabbit increase elevates hawk numbers, increasing predation on sage-grouse and causing their decline despite resource abundance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2314943"}]}
