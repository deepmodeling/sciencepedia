When two species overlap in their use of a limited resource, natural selection can favor individuals that diverge from their competitors, a process known as character displacement. This practice [@problem_id:2287252] presents a classic scenario involving competing desert lizards, challenging you to identify the evolutionary pattern that emerges when competition drives heritable changes in sympatric populations.", "problem": "Two closely related, fictional species of desert lizard, *Arenasaurus siccus* and *Arenasaurus petranus*, are the subject of an ecological study. In desert regions where only one of the species is present (allopatric populations), field biologists observe that both species exhibit a peak foraging activity centered around 6:00 AM. Their primary food source in these regions is the same species of beetle, which is most abundant and active between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM.\n\nIn other desert regions where both lizard species coexist (sympatric populations), biologists observe a consistent and significant shift in behavior. The peak foraging time for *A. siccus* populations is now centered at 5:15 AM, while the peak foraging time for *A. petranus* populations is centered at 6:45 AM. Subsequent genetic analysis has confirmed that these distinct foraging time preferences are heritable traits in both species.\n\nWhich of the following evolutionary concepts best describes the observed divergence in foraging times in the sympatric lizard populations?\n\nA. The competitive exclusion principle\n\nB. Müllerian mimicry\n\nC. Character displacement\n\nD. The founder effect\n\nE. Phenotypic plasticity", "solution": "1. Identify the key observations: In allopatry, both species forage with a peak at 6:00 AM and exploit the same beetle resource abundant between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM. In sympatry, their peaks diverge to 5:15 AM for Arenasaurus siccus and 6:45 AM for Arenasaurus petranus. Genetic analysis confirms these distinct time preferences are heritable.\n2. Infer the ecological context: The two species overlap in resource use (same beetles, same time window) and therefore face interspecific competition in sympatry. The observed temporal separation in sympatry constitutes niche partitioning by time (temporal niche differentiation).\n3. Link to evolutionary mechanism: When trait differences that reduce resource overlap evolve in sympatry due to interspecific competition and are genetically based, this is character displacement. The shift in foraging time is a trait affecting resource acquisition and shows divergent evolution only where the species co-occur, consistent with character displacement.\n4. Evaluate alternatives:\n   - A. Competitive exclusion principle predicts that two species competing for the same limiting resource cannot stably coexist; it does not by itself describe the evolution of divergent, heritable traits allowing coexistence.\n   - B. Mullerian mimicry involves mutual resemblance among harmful species to reinforce predator learning; it is unrelated to temporal foraging shifts.\n   - D. Founder effect is a drift phenomenon due to sampling in small founding populations and would not specifically predict divergence only in sympatry linked to competition.\n   - E. Phenotypic plasticity would imply environmentally induced, non-heritable changes; the problem states the traits are heritable, arguing against plasticity as the primary explanation.\n5. Conclusion: The best description of the observed, heritable, sympatry-specific divergence in resource-use timing is character displacement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2287252"}, {"introduction": "Beyond competition, coevolutionary interactions are often antagonistic, leading to arms races of adaptation and counter-adaptation. This exercise [@problem_id:2287236] explores a fascinating case of deceptive pollination, where an orchid mimics a female wasp to trick males into pollinating it. By modeling the fitness costs and benefits, you can determine the precise ecological conditions under which selection would favor the evolution of discernment in the exploited wasp population.", "problem": "In a particular ecosystem, a species of hammer orchid has coevolved with a species of thynnid wasp. The orchid does not produce nectar but has evolved to mimic the appearance and, more importantly, the species-specific mating pheromones of the female thynnid wasp. Male wasps are drawn to the orchids and attempt to mate with them, a behavior known as pseudocopulation. During this process, the male inadvertently picks up the orchid's pollen sacs, which he then transfers to the next orchid he visits, thus pollinating it.\n\nThis deceptive strategy places a strong selective pressure on the male wasps. Consider a simplified genetic model for the male wasp's ability to discern the orchid's mimicry. A single gene controls this trait, with two alleles:\n\n-   **Allele N (Non-discriminator):** Males with this allele respond to a broader range of pheromone signals. They are unable to distinguish between a real female wasp and a deceptive orchid. They will attempt to mate with either upon encounter.\n-   **Allele D (Discriminator):** Males with this allele have evolved a highly specific response to the precise pheromone profile of female wasps. They can perfectly distinguish and will ignore the orchids. However, this high specificity comes at a cost: there is a chance they might fail to recognize a real female if her pheromone signature varies slightly from the ideal.\n\nLet's quantify the evolutionary trade-offs. Define the following parameters:\n-   `B`: The fitness benefit (in arbitrary units) gained from a successful mating with a female wasp. `B > 0`.\n-   `C`: The fitness cost (in the same units) incurred from attempting to mate with an orchid. This cost represents wasted time, energy, and potential predation risk. `C > 0`.\n-   `p`: The proportion of scent-emitting entities in the environment that are deceptive orchids. Consequently, `1-p` is the proportion that are actual female wasps. `0  p  1`.\n-   `q`: The probability that a Discriminator (D) male fails to recognize and thus fails to mate with a real female wasp upon encounter, due to its stringent recognition criteria. `0  q  1`. A Non-discriminator (N) male is assumed to never fail in this way.\n\nAssuming that natural selection acts to maximize the average fitness gain per encounter, under which of the following conditions will the Discriminator allele (D) be favored over the Non-discriminator allele (N) and therefore tend to increase in frequency in the wasp population?\n\nA. $p > \\frac{qB}{C + qB}$\n\nB. $p  \\frac{qB}{C + qB}$\n\nC. $p > \\frac{qC}{B+C}$\n\nD. $p > \\frac{B(1-q)}{C}$\n\nE. $p  \\frac{C}{B(1-q)}$", "solution": "To determine the condition under which the Discriminator allele (D) is favored, we must compare the expected fitness outcomes for males carrying each allele. The allele with the higher expected fitness will be selected for. We can calculate the expected fitness change per encounter for each type of male.\n\nLet $W_N$ be the expected fitness change for a Non-discriminator (N) male from a single random encounter with a scent-emitting entity.\nA Non-discriminator male cannot distinguish between orchids and females.\n-   With probability $p$, the male encounters an orchid. This results in an unsuccessful mating attempt and incurs a fitness cost of $C$. The fitness change is $-C$.\n-   With probability $1-p$, the male encounters a real female. By the problem's definition, the Non-discriminator never fails to recognize a real female, so this encounter results in a successful mating, yielding a fitness benefit of $B$. The fitness change is $+B$.\n\nThe total expected fitness change for a Non-discriminator male is the sum of these outcomes weighted by their probabilities:\n$W_N = p \\cdot (-C) + (1-p) \\cdot B$\n$W_N = (1-p)B - pC$\n\nNow, let $W_D$ be the expected fitness change for a Discriminator (D) male from a single random encounter.\nA Discriminator male can perfectly identify orchids.\n-   With probability $p$, the male encounters an orchid. It correctly identifies the mimic and ignores it, avoiding the mating attempt. We assume the cost of identification is negligible, so the fitness change is $0$.\n-   With probability $1-p$, the male encounters a real female. However, due to its high specificity, there is a trade-off.\n    -   With a probability of $1-q$, it successfully recognizes the female and mates, gaining the fitness benefit $B$.\n    -   With a probability of $q$, it fails to recognize the female and moves on, resulting in no fitness change (a missed opportunity).\nThe expected fitness change from encountering a female is thus $(1-q)B + q(0) = (1-q)B$.\n\nThe total expected fitness change for a Discriminator male is the sum of these outcomes weighted by their probabilities:\n$W_D = p \\cdot (0) + (1-p) \\cdot [(1-q)B]$\n$W_D = (1-p)(1-q)B$\n\nThe Discriminator allele (D) will be favored by natural selection if the expected fitness for a Discriminator male is greater than the expected fitness for a Non-discriminator male.\n$W_D > W_N$\n$(1-p)(1-q)B > (1-p)B - pC$\n\nNow, we solve this inequality for $p$.\nFirst, expand the terms:\n$(B - pB)(1-q) > B - pB - pC$\n$B - qB - pB + pqB > B - pB - pC$\n\nWe can cancel the $B$ and $-pB$ terms that appear on both sides:\n$-qB + pqB > -pC$\n\nNow, we want to isolate $p$. Let's move all terms with $p$ to one side and the other terms to the other side.\n$pqB + pC > qB$\n\nFactor out $p$ from the left side:\n$p(qB + C) > qB$\n\nSince $B > 0$, $C > 0$, and $q > 0$, the term $(qB + C)$ is strictly positive. Therefore, we can divide both sides by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$p > \\frac{qB}{C + qB}$\n\nThis inequality represents the condition under which the Discriminator allele (D) provides a higher fitness payoff and will be favored by selection.
