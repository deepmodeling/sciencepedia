To assess its long-term survival prospects, they performed a Population Viability Analysis (PVA). The PVA utilized a computer model to run 100 independent simulations, each projecting the vole population's size over a 200-year period, starting from the current population size. A key metric for this species is the quasi-extinction threshold, defined as a population size dropping below 50 individuals, a point from which recovery is considered highly unlikely.\n\nAfter running the simulations, the results were categorized as follows:\n- In 17 of the simulations, the population went completely extinct (dropped to 0 individuals) before the end of the 200-year period.\n- In 26 of the simulations, the population fell below the quasi-extinction threshold of 50 individuals at some point but did not go extinct by the end of the 200-year period.\n- In the remaining simulations, the population size consistently remained at or above 50 individuals for the entire 200-year duration.\n\nBased on these simulation results, what is the estimated probability that a Highland Cloud Vole population will fall below the quasi-extinction threshold of 50 individuals at any point within the next 200 years?

Let $A$ be the event that the population falls below the quasi-extinction threshold of $50$ individuals at any point within $200$ years.\n\nBy the problem statement:\n- In $17$ simulations, the population went extinct, which implies event $A$ occurred in those simulations.\n- In $26$ simulations, the population fell below $50$ but did not go extinct, so event $A$ also occurred.\n- The remaining $100 - 17 - 26 = 57$ simulations did not experience event $A$.\n\nTherefore, the number of simulations in which $A$ occurred is $17 + 26 = 43$.

This practice explores the critical concept that environmental variance can erode a population's growth potential, a phenomenon sometimes called \"variance drag.\" Calculating the long-term instantaneous growth rate will demonstrate why populations can be on a path to extinction even when conditions are, on average, favorable.

The island's climate is subject to significant inter-annual variability, leading to large fluctuations in the availability of key food resources.\n\nOver a decade of study, the biologists have determined that the arithmetic mean of the instantaneous population growth rate is $r = 0.03$ per year. This positive average suggests the population should be growing. However, the environmental fluctuations cause a large variance in this growth rate, which has been quantified as $\\sigma_e^2 = 0.08$ per year-squared.\n\nIn stochastic environments, the long-term viability of a population is not determined by its arithmetic mean growth rate alone. A more accurate predictor is the long-term instantaneous growth rate, which accounts for the year-to-year variability. A negative value for this long-term rate implies that the population is on a trajectory toward extinction, despite the positive short-term average.\n\nAs a consultant for the conservation team, you are tasked with calculating this crucial metric.
