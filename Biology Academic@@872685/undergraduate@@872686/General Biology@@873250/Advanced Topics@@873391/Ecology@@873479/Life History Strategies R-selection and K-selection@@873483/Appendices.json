By analyzing the observed traits—from clutch size to parental behavior—you can deduce its strategy and solidify your understanding of the characteristics that define a $K$-selected organism.", "problem": "A field biologist conducting research in a pristine, stable tropical rainforest discovers a new species of tree frog. Through careful observation, the biologist documents several key aspects of the frog's life history. The environment shows very little seasonal variation in temperature, rainfall, or food availability. The female frogs are observed laying a very small clutch of only 5-10 large, yolk-rich eggs in the water-filled cup of a bromeliad plant. After laying the eggs, the female remains with the clutch, actively guarding them from predators and keeping them moist until they hatch. The adult frogs are territorial and appear to be relatively long-lived compared to other frog species in the region.\n\nBased on this suite of life history traits, how would this frog species be best classified, and why?\n\nA. It is an r-selected species because it is an amphibian, and amphibians in general are characterized by producing a large number of offspring with low survival rates.\n\nB. It is a K-selected species because of the high investment in offspring, as evidenced by the small clutch size and extensive parental care.\n\nC. It is an r-selected species because laying eggs in an external environment like a bromeliad is typical of a species that does not invest heavily in its young.\n\nD. It is a K-selected species because all organisms living in stable, predictable environments like a tropical rainforest are by definition K-strategists.\n\nE. It is impossible to classify without knowing the exact juvenile mortality rate and the age at first reproduction.", "solution": "First, recall the r/K selection framework. r-selected species are typically associated with variable or disturbed environments and exhibit traits such as high fecundity, small offspring size, little or no parental care, early maturity, and short lifespan. K-selected species are typically associated with stable, predictable environments and exhibit traits such as low fecundity, large offspring size, substantial parental care, territoriality or competitiveness, later maturity, and longer lifespan.\n\nApply these criteria to the observed frog:\n- The environment is stable with little seasonal variation, which is characteristic of conditions favoring K-selected strategies.\n- The female lays a very small clutch (5–10) of large, yolk-rich eggs, indicating low fecundity and large offspring size—both classic K-selected traits.\n- The female remains with the clutch, guarding and keeping it moist, indicating high parental investment—another K-selected trait.\n- Adults are territorial and relatively long-lived, both aligning with K-selection.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because it relies on a taxonomic generalization; amphibians display a spectrum of strategies, and the observed traits contradict an r-selected profile.\n- B is correct because the small clutch size, large offspring, and extensive parental care directly indicate high investment per offspring, a hallmark of K-selection.\n- C is incorrect because external egg deposition per se does not imply low parental investment; in this case, parental care is high.\n- D is too absolute; while stable environments favor K-selection, not all organisms in such environments are K-strategists by definition, so the reasoning is flawed even though the conclusion matches; we must base the classification on the specific life history traits provided.\n- E is incorrect because the given suite of life history traits is sufficient to classify the strategy without exact numerical values for juvenile mortality or age at first reproduction.\n\nTherefore, the best classification is K-selected based on high parental investment, small clutch size, large offspring, territoriality, and longer lifespan in a stable environment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2300066"}, {"introduction": "Building on the ability to identify a single strategy, this next exercise [@problem_id:2300092] challenges you to think like an ecologist comparing different species within the same ecosystem. You will analyze two fish species with contrasting life histories and two distinct lake zones with different levels of stability. Your task is to correctly match each species to its ecological niche, demonstrating your understanding of how environmental pressures select for either $r$- or $K$-strategies.", "problem": "In a large, ancient freshwater lake, two distinct ecological zones support different fish species. The first zone is the deep, open-water pelagic zone, which is characterized by highly stable temperatures, consistent low-level nutrient availability, and a population of large, efficient piscivorous predators. The second zone is the shallow, vegetated littoral zone, which experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in temperature, oxygen levels, and water depth. This zone is also subject to unpredictable bursts of resources (like insect hatches) and variable predation from both aquatic and terrestrial animals.\n\nTwo dominant fish species inhabit the lake:\n\n- **Species A (\"Silver Shiner\"):** This species has a small body size, reaches sexual maturity in under a year, and has a typical lifespan of 2-3 years. During a brief breeding season, a female lays thousands of very small eggs that are dispersed by currents, with no subsequent parental care.\n- **Species B (\"Abyssal Grouper\"):** This species has a large body size, takes several years to reach sexual maturity, and can live for over 20 years.

Both species are K-strategists, with their different traits representing adaptations to different predator types within the same selective regime.\n\nF. Both species are r-strategists, as fish life histories are primarily determined by high juvenile mortality regardless of habitat.", "solution": "The problem requires us to apply the principles of r- and K-selection theory to determine the life history strategy of two fish species and associate them with their respective habitats.\n\nFirst, let's define the core concepts. The r/K selection theory is a model in ecology that describes two contrasting evolutionary strategies for reproduction and survival.\n\n**K-selection** is favored in stable, predictable environments where populations tend to exist at or near the carrying capacity of the environment, denoted by the variable $K$. In such environments, competition for limited resources is high. The selective pressures favor traits that enhance competitive ability and individual survival. These traits typically include:\n- Large body size\n- Long lifespan\n- Slow development and delayed sexual maturity\n- Production of few, large offspring\n- High parental investment to ensure offspring survival (iteroparity is common)\n\n**r-selection** is favored in unstable, unpredictable environments where populations are often well below the carrying capacity. In these environments, the ability to reproduce rapidly and colonize new or temporarily vacant habitats is advantageous. The selective pressures favor a high intrinsic rate of population increase, denoted by the variable $r$. These traits typically include:\n- Small body size\n- Short lifespan\n- Rapid development and early sexual maturity\n- Production of many, small offspring\n- Low or no parental investment\n\nNext, we analyze the two habitats described in the problem.\n- **Pelagic Zone:** This zone is described as \"highly stable,\" with \"consistent...availability\" of resources. This is a classic description of a K-selecting environment. The population is likely near its carrying capacity, and competition is a major factor.\n- **Littoral Zone:** This zone is described with terms like \"significant seasonal fluctuations,\" \"unpredictable bursts of resources,\" and \"variable predation.\" This is a classic description of an r-selecting environment. Conditions are unstable, favoring organisms that can reproduce quickly to take advantage of favorable periods.\n\nNow, we analyze the traits of the two species.\n- **Species A (Silver Shiner):** Small body size, rapid maturity (under a year), short lifespan, thousands of small eggs, and no parental care. These are all hallmark traits of an **r-strategist**.\n- **Species B (Abyssal Grouper):** Large body size, slow maturity (several years), long lifespan, few large eggs, and high parental investment (guarded nest). These are all hallmark traits of a **K-strategist**.\n\nFinally, we synthesize the information to determine the correct association.\n- The **Abyssal Grouper** is a **K-strategist**. The K-selecting environment is the stable **pelagic zone**. Therefore, the Abyssal Grouper is a K-strategist adapted to the pelagic zone.\n- The **Silver Shiner** is an **r-strategist**. The r-selecting environment is the fluctuating **littoral zone**. Therefore, the Silver Shiner is an r-strategist adapted to the littoral zone.\n\nWe now evaluate the given options:\nA. Incorrect. It correctly identifies the strategies but incorrectly maps them to the habitats.\nB. Incorrect. It incorrectly identifies the strategies and incorrectly maps them to the habitats.\nC. Correct. This option correctly identifies the Silver Shiner as an r-strategist adapted to the littoral zone and the Abyssal Grouper as a K-strategist adapted to the pelagic zone.\nD. Incorrect. It incorrectly identifies the strategies for both species.\nE. Incorrect. This option mischaracterizes the clear r-selected traits of the Silver Shiner. The environmental differences are too stark to support the same selective regime.\nF. Incorrect. This option ignores the significant differences in traits and the environmental pressures that shape them, dismissing the entire r/K framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the Silver Shiner is an r-strategist adapted to the littoral zone, and the Abyssal Grouper is a K-strategist adapted to the pelagic zone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2300092"}, {"introduction": "Life history is fundamentally a story of trade-offs, and we can explore these compromises using simple mathematical models.

The larval phase is planktonic and subject to extremely high mortality (an r-selected pressure), while the adult phase is sessile and engages in intense competition for limited space on rocky substrates (a K-selected pressure).\n\nA biologist models the lifetime reproductive fitness, $W$, of an individual as a function of $f$, the fraction of its total acquired energy that it allocates to gamete production. The remaining fraction, $(1-f)$, is used for adult growth, maintenance, and developing competitive structures. The model proposes a trade-off between these two allocations:\n\n1.  The total number of larvae that successfully survive the planktonic stage and settle onto a substrate is directly proportional to the energy invested in gametes. This larval success component is therefore proportional to $f$.\n2.  The probability of the adult surviving and successfully defending its territory until the next reproductive season is strongly dependent on the energy retained for its own maintenance. This adult survival component is found to be proportional to the cube of the fraction of energy retained, i.e., proportional to $(1-f)^3$.\n\nThe overall lifetime fitness, $W$, is modeled as the product of the larval success component and the adult survival component. Based on this model, what is the optimal fraction, $f$, of energy that an individual *Lithoclava paradoxa* should allocate to gamete production to maximize its lifetime reproductive fitness?\n\nExpress your answer as an exact fraction.", "solution": "Let the proportionality constant be $k>0$.
