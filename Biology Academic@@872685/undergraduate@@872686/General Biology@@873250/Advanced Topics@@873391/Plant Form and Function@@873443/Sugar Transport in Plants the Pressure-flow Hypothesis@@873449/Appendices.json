By considering the metabolic needs of different organs, you can predict the path of nutrient flow.", "problem": "An experiment is conducted on a healthy, mature plant that is currently in its flowering stage. The plant possesses several key structures: a single, developing flower bud; a large, mature storage root (such as a taproot); and numerous mature photosynthetically active leaves. For the experiment, one of the mature leaves is enclosed in a transparent, airtight bag that is filled with carbon dioxide gas containing a radioactive isotope, carbon-14 ($^{14}\\text{C}$). The plant is illuminated, allowing photosynthesis to proceed for several hours. This process incorporates the radioactive $^{14}\\text{C}$ into sucrose molecules within the treated leaf. After this period, the plant is analyzed to determine the distribution of the radioactive sucrose.\n\nAssuming the plant's transport systems are fully functional, which of the following locations would be expected to show the highest concentration of radioactivity, indicating the greatest accumulation of the newly synthesized sugars?\n\nA. The mature storage root.\n\nB. The vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) of the main stem.\n\nC. The developing flower bud.\n\nD. The mature leaf that was enclosed in the bag.\n\nE. All sinks would show an equal concentration of radioactivity.", "solution": "The mature, photosynthetically active leaf enclosed in $^{14}\\text{CO}_{2}$ is the source tissue. Photosynthesis fixes $^{14}\\text{C}$ into triose phosphates that are converted to sucrose, which is then phloem-loaded. According to the pressure-flow (Münch) mechanism, phloem loading increases sieve element solute concentration $C_{s}$ at the source, raising osmotic pressure\n$$\n\\Pi_{s} = R T C_{s},\n$$\nwhich lowers the source water potential $\\psi_{s}$, drives water influx from xylem, and elevates source turgor pressure $P_{s}$. At sinks, sucrose unloading lowers solute concentration $C_{k}$ and osmotic pressure $\\Pi_{k} = R T C_{k}$, raises $\\psi_{k}$, promotes water efflux, and lowers sink turgor pressure $P_{k}$. The resulting pressure gradient drives bulk flow with flux\n$$\nJ = K \\left(P_{s} - P_{k}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the hydraulic conductance of the phloem pathway. Among multiple sinks $i$, partitioning of assimilate follows relative sink strengths and pathway resistances; stronger unloading and utilization at a sink $i$ lowers $P_{k,i}$ more, yielding larger $P_{s} - P_{k,i}$ and larger $J_{i}$, hence greater accumulation of label.\n\nSink strength is highest in rapidly growing and developing tissues due to high rates of unloading and metabolism. In a flowering plant, a developing flower bud is a dominant sink compared with a mature storage root, which, being already mature, has reduced incremental demand for new assimilate. The vascular tissue of the stem is a conduit, not a primary site of net accumulation; it will transiently contain labeled sucrose but not retain the highest concentration. The labeled mature leaf is a net exporter (source), so it will not accumulate the greatest amount of labeled sucrose. Because sink strengths differ, not all sinks will show equal radioactivity.\n\nTherefore, the developing flower bud will show the highest concentration of radioactivity due to its strongest sink strength during the flowering stage.\n\nEliminations:\n- A: Mature storage root—sink but typically weaker than an actively developing reproductive sink when already mature.\n- B: Stem vascular tissue—transient conduit, not a site of maximal accumulation.\n- D: Labeled mature leaf—net source, exports sucrose.\n- E: Incorrect because sink strengths are not equal.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the developing flower bud.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315522"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative predictions, we can use mathematical models to quantify sugar transport.

A specific, well-illuminated source leaf is found to maintain a high hydrostatic (turgor) pressure of $P_{source} = 2.20$ MPa within its sieve-tube elements. This leaf supplies sucrose to two primary sinks: a nearby developing fruit and the distant root system.\n\nThe fruit is a very active sink, maintaining a low local phloem pressure of $P_{fruit} = 0.75$ MPa. The phloem path length from the source leaf to the fruit is $L_{fruit} = 0.30$ m. The root system is a less active sink, maintaining a phloem pressure of $P_{root} = 1.40$ MPa. The phloem path length from the source leaf to the roots is $L_{root} = 1.80$ m.\n\nAssume that the phloem sap has a uniform viscosity and that the anatomy of the sieve tubes is consistent throughout the plant. Under these conditions, the volume flow rate ($Q$) of sap through a phloem segment is given by the relation $Q = \\frac{k\\Delta P}{L}$, where $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the segment, $L$ is its length, and $k$ is a constant representing the hydraulic conductivity of the phloem tissue. The mass of sucrose transported is directly proportional to the volume flow rate of the sap.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total mass of sucrose allocated to the fruit to the total mass of sucrose allocated to the roots ($J_{\\text{fruit}}/J_{\\text{root}}$).

This mutant strain has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the SUT1 sucrose-proton symporter. In wild-type plants, SUT1 is highly expressed and localized to the plasma membrane of companion cells within the minor veins of source leaves. This symporter is essential for actively loading sucrose from the apoplast (the space outside the cell membrane) into the phloem. The mutant plant is grown alongside a wild-type control plant under identical, optimal conditions for photosynthesis and growth (i.e., adequate light, water, and soil nutrients).\n\nBased on the pressure-flow hypothesis of phloem transport, which of the following sets of physiological consequences would be most expected in the SUT1 mutant plant compared to the wild-type control?\n\nA. Increased turgor pressure in leaf mesophyll cells, decreased turgor pressure in the phloem sieve tube elements of the leaves, and severely inhibited root growth.\n\nB.

In source leaves of wild type, SUT1 actively loads sucrose from the apoplast into companion cells/sieve elements, making $\\Psi_{s}$ in the sieve tubes more negative, which draws in water osmotically from the xylem, thereby increasing $\\Psi_{p}$ in sieve tube elements. This elevated $\\Psi_{p}$ at the source drives mass flow toward sinks.\n\nIn the SUT1 loss-of-function mutant:\n1) Phloem loading in source leaves is impaired. Therefore, in sieve tube elements of source leaves, sucrose concentration is reduced relative to wild type, so $\\Psi_{s}$ is less negative, water influx is reduced, and $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor pressure) in sieve tube elements decreases relative to wild type.\n2) Because sucrose export from mesophyll to the phloem is impaired, sugars accumulate in source leaf cells (mesophyll and associated tissues). This accumulation makes $\\Psi_{s}$ in mesophyll cells more negative, causing greater water influx and thus an increase in $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor pressure) of mesophyll cells relative to wild type.\n3) Reduced phloem export from source leaves lowers carbohydrate delivery to sinks such as roots, leading to severely inhibited root growth.\n\nThese outcomes correspond to increased turgor pressure in leaf mesophyll cells, decreased turgor pressure in the phloem sieve tube elements of the leaves, and severely inhibited root growth, which matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1752303"}]}
