{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before delving into complex genetics, a biologist's first step is often to ask a fundamental question: how does this plant reproduce? This practice challenges you to think like a field botanist, interpreting the results of a classic manipulative experiment to determine a plant's breeding system and its reliance on pollinators [@problem_id:2278431]. By analyzing the outcomes of different treatments, you will learn how to distinguish between self-pollination, cross-pollination, and other reproductive modes.", "problem": "A botanist is studying the reproductive biology of a newly discovered angiosperm species, *Botanica investigata*. The flowers of this species are perfect, meaning they contain both male (stamens) and female (pistil) reproductive organs. To determine the plant's breeding system, the botanist conducts an experiment on 400 flowers across several individuals. The flowers are divided into four equal groups of 100.\n\n- **Group 1 (Control):** Flowers were left untouched and exposed to the natural environment, where various insects were observed visiting the flowers.\n- **Group 2 (Bagging):** Flowers were enclosed in fine-mesh bags before their stigmas became receptive. The bags prevented insects from visiting but allowed air and light to pass through.\n- **Group 3 (Emasculation and Bagging):** Before the flowers opened, their stamens were carefully removed (a process called emasculation). The flowers were then immediately enclosed in fine-mesh bags.\n- **Group 4 (Emasculation and Hand-Pollination):** Flowers were emasculated as in Group 3. Once their stigmas became receptive, they were manually dusted with pollen collected from a different plant of the same species located 100 meters away. After hand-pollination, the flowers were also enclosed in fine-mesh bags.\n\nAfter several weeks, the botanist recorded the number of flowers in each group that successfully developed into mature fruits containing seeds. The results are as follows:\n\n- **Group 1:** 82 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 2:** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 3:** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 4:** 89 flowers developed into fruit.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely conclusion about the breeding system of *Botanica investigata*?\n\nA. The plant is an obligate self-pollinator and depends on wind, not insects, for pollination.\n\nB. The plant is capable of both self-pollination and cross-pollination, but cross-pollination is more successful.\n\nC. The plant reproduces asexually through a process like apomixis, where seeds develop without fertilization.\n\nD. The plant is an obligate cross-pollinator (outcrosser) and likely has a self-incompatibility mechanism.\n\nE. The experiment is flawed, as the process of bagging damaged the flowers, preventing any fruit development.", "solution": "We analyze each treatment against the predictions of different breeding systems.\n\n1. Interpretations of the treatments:\n- Group 1 (control, open to visitors): If the plant is animal-pollinated and compatible with cross-pollen, we expect substantial fruit set due to natural pollination.\n- Group 2 (bagged, intact flowers): If the plant can self-fertilize autonomously (autogamy) or reproduce asexually (apomixis), some fruit should set without pollinators. If it is wind-pollinated and the mesh allows airborne pollen, some fruit might also set. If it is obligately outcrossing and self-incompatible, with no pollinator access, fruit set should be near zero.\n- Group 3 (emasculated and bagged): With stamens removed and no pollen applied, only apomixis could yield fruit; otherwise, fruit set should be zero.\n- Group 4 (emasculated, hand-crossed, bagged): If cross-pollen is compatible, fruit set should be high; this also tests that bagging itself does not prevent fruit development.\n\n2. Match observations to predictions:\n- Group 2 yielded $0/100$ fruits. This rules out autonomous selfing and strongly argues against apomixis. It also argues against obligate wind pollination as the sole mechanism because, with air movement permitted, at least some fruit might be expected if wind-borne pollen could reach stigmas; moreover, the decisive comparison is with Group 4 (see below), which shows the bags themselves did not prevent fertilization or fruit development once compatible pollen was applied.\n- Group 3 yielded $0/100$ fruits, which directly rules out apomixis (no seeds without fertilization).\n- Group 4 yielded $89/100$ fruits after manual application of cross-pollen, demonstrating that outcross pollen is fully compatible and that the bagging treatment did not damage flowers or prevent fruit development.\n- Group 1 yielded $82/100$ fruits under natural visitation, consistent with effective animal-mediated pollination; the slightly lower value than Group 4 suggests natural pollination is somewhat limited compared to controlled hand-crossing, as is commonly observed.\n\n3. Synthesize the breeding system inference:\n- The complete absence of fruit in Group 2 despite the presence of anthers and stigmas within the same bag excludes autonomous selfing and, coupled with the success of hand-crossing in Group 4, points to a requirement for outcross pollen.\n- The success of Group 4 combined with the failure of Group 2 is most parsimoniously explained by self-incompatibility: self-pollen fails to fertilize, whereas cross-pollen succeeds.\n- The success of Group 1 with insect visitation identifies biotic pollination (insect pollinators) as the natural mechanism; bagging did not itself preclude fruit set once compatible pollen was supplied (Group 4), so the lack of fruit in Group 2 is not due to bag damage.\n\n4. Eliminate incorrect options:\n- A is contradicted by the lack of fruit in Group 2 and the success with insect access in Group 1; also, Group 4 shows bagging does not prevent fruit set once compatible pollen is present.\n- B is not supported because there is no evidence of successful selfing; Group 2 shows no autonomous selfing, and no treatment demonstrates successful self-pollination.\n- C is ruled out by $0/100$ in Groups 2 and 3.\n- E is ruled out because Group 4 fruits developed despite bagging.\n\nTherefore, the data support that the species is an obligate outcrosser, likely with a self-incompatibility mechanism.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2278431"}, {"introduction": "Many plants have evolved sophisticated genetic systems to prevent inbreeding. This exercise moves from the experimental discovery of an outcrossing system to its underlying molecular logic, focusing on Sporophytic Self-Incompatibility (SSI) [@problem_id:2278404]. You will apply the rules of an SSI system, including a dominance hierarchy between alleles, to predict the success or failure of specific crosses, a skill essential for both conservation genetics and crop breeding.", "problem": "A team of conservation biologists is studying a population of a rare flowering plant species that relies on a genetic system known as Sporophytic Self-Incompatibility (SSI) to prevent inbreeding. This system is controlled by a single gene, the S-locus, which has multiple alleles. In SSI, the compatibility of a pollen grain is determined by the diploid genotype of its parent plant (the sporophyte), not by the pollen's own haploid S-allele. Pollen is rejected if the S-proteins expressed on its surface, which are determined by the parent's diploid genotype, match any of the S-proteins expressed by the stigma's diploid tissue.\n\nIn the population under study, three alleles ($S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$) are present. These alleles exhibit a linear dominance hierarchy in their expression in the pollen coat: $S_1$ is dominant to both $S_2$ and $S_3$, and $S_2$ is dominant to $S_3$ ($S_1 > S_2 > S_3$). This means a heterozygous parent plant will only express the protein of the dominant allele on the surface of all its pollen grains. For example, a plant with genotype $S_1S_2$ would produce pollen that exclusively has the $S_1$ phenotype. The stigma, being diploid tissue, expresses proteins corresponding to both of its S-alleles.\n\nThe biologists plan to perform a controlled cross. They will use pollen from a plant with the genotype $S_1S_3$ to pollinate a plant with the genotype $S_2S_3$. Based on the rules of this SSI system, what is the expected outcome of this cross?\n\nA. The cross will be successful. Fertilization can occur.\n\nB. The cross will fail completely due to an incompatibility reaction.\n\nC. The cross will be partially successful; only pollen grains carrying the $S_3$ allele will be able to fertilize the ovules.\n\nD. The cross will be partially successful; only pollen grains carrying the $S_1$ allele will be able to fertilize the ovules.\n\nE. The outcome cannot be determined without knowing the genotypes of the resulting ovules.", "solution": "In sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI), the compatibility of a pollen grain is determined by the phenotype of the pollen coat, which reflects the diploid genotype of the pollen parent (the sporophyte). A dominance hierarchy among S-alleles governs which S-protein is expressed on all pollen from a given heterozygous plant. Given the hierarchy $S_{1} > S_{2} > S_{3}$, a plant with genotype $S_{1}S_{3}$ produces pollen that uniformly expresses the $S_{1}$ phenotype, regardless of the haploid S-allele carried by individual pollen grains.\n\nThe stigma is diploid tissue and expresses both of its S-alleles. Thus, a plant with genotype $S_{2}S_{3}$ presents both $S_{2}$ and $S_{3}$ S-proteins on the stigma surface.\n\nThe SSI rejection rule is: pollen is rejected if and only if the pollen phenotype matches any S-allele expressed by the stigma. Formally, let the pollen phenotype be $P$ and the set of stigma S-alleles be $T$. Compatibility occurs if $P \\notin T$; incompatibility occurs if $P \\in T$.\n\nFor the cross using pollen from $S_{1}S_{3}$ onto a stigma of $S_{2}S_{3}$, the pollen phenotype is $P = S_{1}$ and the stigma expresses $T = \\{S_{2}, S_{3}\\}$. Since $S_{1} \\notin \\{S_{2}, S_{3}\\}$, the incompatibility reaction is not triggered, and all pollen grains are accepted. Because all pollen from the $S_{1}S_{3}$ donor share the same expressed phenotype $S_{1}$, there is no partial compatibility by haplotype; the outcome is entirely compatible.\n\nTherefore, the cross will be successful and fertilization can occur, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2278404"}, {"introduction": "A plant's reproductive strategy is a product of evolution, shaped by balancing costs and benefits in a given environment. This problem explores the fascinating case of dimorphic cleistogamy, where plants produce both \"safe\" self-pollinating flowers and \"risky\" but genetically beneficial outcrossing flowers [@problem_id:2278412]. By building a simple fitness model, you will calculate the ecological tipping point—the minimum pollination success—that makes the more expensive, open-flowered strategy evolutionarily worthwhile.", "problem": "A species of annual plant exhibits dimorphic cleistogamy, a reproductive strategy involving two types of flowers. The first type are chasmogamous (CH) flowers, which are open-petaled and designed for outcrossing via pollinators. The second type are cleistogamous (CL) flowers, which remain closed and undergo obligate self-pollination.\n\nThe production of each flower type has an associated resource cost. A CH flower is more costly, requiring $C_{CH} = 4.2$ arbitrary resource units, while a CL flower is cheaper, costing $C_{CL} = 1.2$ resource units. The plant's reproductive success is influenced by two key factors: pollinator availability and the consequences of inbreeding.\n\nThe probability that any given CH flower is successfully pollinated and sets seed is denoted by $P_{poll}$. In contrast, CL flowers are guaranteed to set seed, so their pollination probability is 1. All successfully pollinated flowers, regardless of type, are assumed to produce the same number of seeds.\n\nHowever, the offspring from self-pollination suffer from inbreeding depression, quantified by a coefficient $\\delta$. The relative fitness of a self-pollinated offspring is $(1-\\delta)$ compared to an outcrossed offspring, whose relative fitness is defined as 1. For this plant species, the inbreeding depression coefficient is $\\delta = 0.75$.\n\nAn evolutionarily stable strategy for the plant is to allocate its fixed budget of reproductive resources in a way that maximizes its total expected fitness (i.e., the total number of surviving offspring). For the plant to find it evolutionarily advantageous to allocate any resources to producing the more expensive CH flowers, the expected fitness return from those flowers must be at least as great as the return from the cheaper, but genetically less robust, CL flowers.\n\nCalculate the minimum pollination probability, $P_{crit}$, for chasmogamous flowers that must be met or exceeded for the production of CH flowers to be a worthwhile strategy. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "Let each successful flower, regardless of type, produce $s$ seeds. The relative fitness per seed is $1$ for outcrossed offspring and $(1-\\delta)$ for selfed offspring.\n\nFor a CH flower, the probability of successful pollination is $P_{poll}$, and all resulting offspring are outcrossed. Thus the expected fitness return per CH flower is $s P_{poll}$. Accounting for the resource cost $C_{CH}$, the expected fitness return per unit resource for CH is\n$$\n\\frac{s P_{poll}}{C_{CH}}.\n$$\n\nFor a CL flower, pollination is certain and all offspring are selfed, so the expected fitness return per CL flower is $s(1-\\delta)$.
