This practice places you in the role of an experimental botanist, tasked with analyzing data to determine how the hormones Abscisic Acid (ABA) and Gibberellic Acid (GA) collaborate to control this process. By examining the results from different treatments, you will uncover whether their absolute amounts or their relative balance is the key to unlocking dormancy [@problem_id:1741006].", "problem": "A team of botanists is investigating the hormonal regulation of seed dormancy in a species of wild lettuce. They hypothesize that the balance between two key plant hormones, Abscisic Acid (ABA) and Gibberellic Acid (GA), is the critical factor determining whether a seed germinates. To test this, they prepare five batches of seeds and treat them with different aqueous solutions for 24 hours before placing them in ideal germination conditions. After seven days, they record the percentage of seeds that have germinated.\n\nThe experimental groups and their results are as follows:\n- **Group 1 (Control):** Seeds were soaked in distilled water. The germination rate was 50%.\n- **Group 2:** Seeds were treated with a solution containing 10 micromolar ($\\mu$M) ABA and 1 $\\mu$M GA. The germination rate was 5%.\n- **Group 3:** Seeds were treated with a solution containing 1 $\\mu$M ABA and 10 $\\mu$M GA. The germination rate was 98%.\n- **Group 4:** Seeds were treated with a solution containing 50 $\\mu$M ABA and 500 $\\mu$M GA. The germination rate was 97%.\n- **Group 5:** Seeds were treated with a solution containing 5 $\\mu$M ABA and 0.5 $\\mu$M GA. The germination rate was 6%.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following is the most well-supported conclusion?\n\nA. The ratio of ABA to GA is the primary factor controlling germination, where a low ABA/GA ratio strongly promotes it.\n\nB. High absolute concentrations of GA are required to overcome dormancy, regardless of the ABA concentration.\n\nC. Dormancy is primarily determined by the absolute concentration of ABA; any concentration of ABA above 2 $\\mu$M is sufficient to induce deep dormancy.\n\nD. Both hormones are toxic at high concentrations; the highest total hormone concentration resulted in nearly the lowest germination.\n\nE. ABA and GA act independently, and massive germination only occurs if the absolute concentration of GA is at least 100 times greater than that of the control.", "solution": "Let $[A]$ denote the ABA concentration and $[G]$ the GA concentration. Define the hormonal balance as the ratio\n$$\nr=\\frac{[A]}{[G]}.\n$$\nLet $g$ denote the germination fraction.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Group 2: $[A]=10\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, $[G]=1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, so $r=10$, and $g=0.05$.\n- Group 5: $[A]=5\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, $[G]=0.5\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, so $r=10$, and $g=0.06$.\nThese two groups share the same ratio $r=10$ but differ by a factor of $10$ in both $[A]$ and $[G]$ and by a factor of $2$ in total hormone.

Both yield similarly high $g$, indicating high germination is associated with low $r$ independent of absolute concentrations.\n\nThe control (Group 1, water) has $g=0.50$, serving as a baseline.\n\nEvaluate the options against the data:\n- Option A (ratio control): Identical ratios ($r=10$ versus $r=0.1$) produce consistently low versus high $g$ across large changes in absolute concentrations, supporting that a low $r$ strongly promotes germination.\n- Option B (high absolute GA required regardless of ABA): Groups 3 and 4 show that once $r$ is low, $g$ is high over a $50$-fold range of absolute $[G]$. Moreover, Groups 2 and 5 show that low $[G]$ does not rescue germination when $r$ is high, indicating the effect depends on ABA relative to GA, not GA alone regardless of ABA. Thus absolute $[G]$ alone is not the primary determinant.\n- Option C (absolute ABA threshold): Group 4 has $[A]=50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ yet $g=0.97$, directly contradicting any absolute ABA threshold (such as $2\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) that would enforce deep dormancy irrespective of GA.\n- Option D (toxicity at high total hormone): Group 4 has the highest total hormone yet near-maximal $g$, contradicting a toxicity-driven decrease.\n- Option E (independence and GA absolute threshold relative to control): The data show dependence on the ratio, not independence. Additionally, referencing a fixed multiple of the control is ill-posed since the control has $[G]=0$, and the observed pattern is governed by $r$, not by an absolute GA threshold.\n\nTherefore, the most well-supported conclusion is that the ABA/GA ratio primarily controls germination, with a low ratio strongly promoting it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1741006"}, {"introduction": "Once the decision to germinate is made, the seed must fuel its growth by metabolizing stored reserves, a process that requires immense energy. This exercise provides a quantitative look at the cell's power plants, comparing the energy yield from glucose under aerobic (oxygen-rich) and anaerobic (oxygen-poor) conditions.
