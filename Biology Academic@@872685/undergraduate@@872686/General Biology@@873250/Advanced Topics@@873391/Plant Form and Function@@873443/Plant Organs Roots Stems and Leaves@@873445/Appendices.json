{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly understand how a plant functions as an integrated organism, we must first grasp how it transports essential resources between its organs. This practice explores the classic botanical experiment of girdling, which involves removing a ring of bark from a tree's trunk. By predicting the consequences of this action, you will untangle the distinct roles of the two major vascular tissues, xylem and phloem, and appreciate the critical dependence of the roots on the photosynthetic leaves, and vice versa [@problem_id:2308130].", "problem": "A botanist is studying nutrient transport in a mature, healthy deciduous fruit tree. At the beginning of the growing season, just after the leaves have fully emerged, the botanist carefully removes a complete ring of tissue from the main trunk, about one meter above the ground. The cut is deep enough to remove the bark and all tissues external to the solid, woody core (the xylem). The tree is then monitored for one full year. Assuming the tree is not affected by secondary factors like disease or pests infecting the wound, which of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the sequence of observations?\n\nA. The leaves will immediately wilt, and the entire tree will die within a week because water transport from the roots has been severed.\n\nB. The tree will show no significant negative effects, as the woody core remains intact and the tree will quickly grow new tissue over the exposed ring.\n\nC. The leaves and fruit above the ring will initially appear healthy, and may even be larger than normal, but the roots will eventually starve and die, leading to the death of the entire tree in the following months.\n\nD. The roots and the lower part of the trunk will remain healthy, but the leaves and branches above the ring will die due to a lack of nutrients and water supplied by the roots.\n\nE. The leaves and fruit will die almost immediately due to the interruption of nutrient flow, while the roots will survive by entering a dormant state until the next growing season.", "solution": "The operation described is a classic girdling: removing all tissues external to the solid woody core removes the bark, including the phloem and cambium, while leaving the xylem intact. The key transport functions are:\n- Xylem: transports water and mineral nutrients from roots to shoots, driven by transpiration and the cohesion-tension mechanism. Continuity of xylem allows continued upward water flow; severing phloem does not interrupt this.\n- Phloem: transports photosynthates (primarily sucrose) from sources (leaves) to sinks (roots, developing fruits, cambium) according to the pressure-flow (Muench) hypothesis. This requires a continuous sieve tube pathway; removing a complete ring prevents translocation across the wound.\n\nImmediately after girdling, the xylem is intact, so water potential gradients continue to drive water ascent. Thus, the leaves do not immediately wilt. Symbolically, if $\\Psi_{w}=\\Psi_{p}+\\Psi_{s}+\\Psi_{g}+\\Psi_{m}$ is the water potential and the xylem continuity is maintained, the transpirational stream persists, so shoot hydration is maintained.\n\nIn contrast, phloem transport across the girdle is interrupted. At source leaves above the ring, sucrose loading continues, increasing solute concentration in the phloem above the girdle, decreasing $\\Psi_{s}$ (more negative) and tending to raise $\\Psi_{p}$ upstream. This causes accumulation of carbohydrates above the girdle, often leading to swelling and enhanced growth of leaves and fruits above the cut, because sink demand above the cut can still be met by local phloem movement; however, no phloem translocation can pass the girdle to the roots.\n\nBelow the girdle, the roots are deprived of incoming carbohydrates. Root metabolism depends on imported photosynthate for respiration; with the phloem severed, the substrate supply for respiration declines over time. As root starch reserves are consumed and not replenished, root tissues starve and die. As roots die, water and mineral uptake from the soil declines and eventually ceases, which then secondarily compromises xylem supply to the canopy. Over subsequent months, this leads to the decline and eventual death of the aboveground parts as well.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because xylem water flow is not severed; immediate wilting does not occur.\n- B is incorrect because removal of the cambium with the bark prevents rapid regeneration of functional phloem; the physiological disruption is severe.\n- C is correct: initial health and even enlargement above the girdle due to carbohydrate accumulation, followed by root starvation and eventual death of the whole tree.\n- D is incorrect because the roots are the first to be deprived of carbohydrates; the initial problem is not lack of water in the canopy.\n- E is incorrect because leaves and fruit do not die immediately; roots cannot simply persist in a dormant state without carbohydrate supply and will die first.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that shoots above the girdle initially appear healthy and may be larger than normal, but the roots starve and die, followed by death of the entire tree in the following months, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2308130"}, {"introduction": "A plant's form is not fixed; it is actively shaped by internal chemical messengers. This problem examines the common horticultural practice of pruning, linking a simple physical action to the complex world of plant hormones. By analyzing why removing the tip of a stem encourages a plant to become bushier, you will explore the concept of apical dominance and the central role of auxin in regulating plant architecture [@problem_id:2308149].", "problem": "A horticulturalist is cultivating a species of ornamental shrub. To encourage a fuller, bushier appearance rather than a tall, spindly one, they perform a common pruning technique: they remove the terminal bud (apical bud) from the top of the main stem. This procedure is known to stimulate the growth of the buds located in the axils of the leaves along the stem (axillary buds).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate hormonal explanation for why the axillary buds begin to grow after the apical bud is removed?\n\nA. The axillary buds will remain dormant due to a surge in gibberellins from the cut site, which promotes vertical growth over lateral growth.\n\nB. The axillary buds will begin to grow because the removal of the apical bud eliminates the primary source of auxin, a hormone that, at high concentrations, inhibits their development.\n\nC. The axillary buds will trans-differentiate into adventitious roots due to the now-dominant influence of cytokinins being transported up from the root system.\n\nD. The overall plant growth will cease because the apical meristem, the only site of primary growth, has been permanently removed, preventing any further cell division.\n\nE. The axillary buds will enter a deeper state of dormancy because the physical damage of pruning triggers a massive release of the stress hormone, abscisic acid.", "solution": "The physiological basis of apical dominance is that the apical bud synthesizes auxin, which is transported basipetally along the stem. Elevated auxin levels in the stem near axillary buds inhibit their outgrowth. When the apical bud is removed (decapitation), the primary source of auxin is eliminated, leading to a decrease in auxin concentration in the vicinity of axillary buds. This releases the inhibition and permits axillary buds to resume growth, often aided by relatively increased cytokinin influence and improved sugar availability.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because gibberellins are not known to surge from the cut site to enforce dormancy of axillary buds, and vertical growth is not promoted when the apical meristem is removed.\n- Option B is correct. It states that removal of the apical bud eliminates the primary source of auxin, and high auxin concentration inhibits axillary bud outgrowth; thus, its removal allows these buds to grow.\n- Option C is incorrect because cytokinins generally promote shoot branching and bud outgrowth rather than converting axillary buds into roots; adventitious rooting is more closely associated with auxin.\n- Option D is incorrect because primary growth can continue from other meristematic tissues, including axillary meristems; removal of the apical meristem does not halt all growth.\n- Option E is incorrect because although wounding can induce stress signals, the typical response to apical bud removal is the release of apical dominance and stimulation of axillary bud outgrowth, not deeper dormancy via abscisic acid.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate hormonal explanation is that axillary buds grow after removal of the apical bud due to the loss of auxin-mediated inhibition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2308149"}, {"introduction": "While we can easily observe roots, stems, and leaves, many of a plant's most critical functions occur at the microscopic level. This exercise challenges you to consider the role of a specialized anatomical feature within the root: the Casparian strip. Through a thought experiment involving a hypothetical mutant plant, you will discover how this subcellular structure acts as a vital gatekeeper, enabling the root to selectively control which substances from the soil enter the plant's vascular system [@problem_id:2308147].", "problem": "A plant biologist discovers a novel mutant strain of a common crop plant. This mutant exhibits stunted growth and signs of nutrient toxicity despite being grown in soil with a balanced mineral composition. Upon microscopic examination of the root cross-sections, the biologist observes that the endodermal cells fail to develop a proper Casparian strip, which is normally a band of waterproof suberin impregnating the cell walls. In a typical plant, water and minerals can travel from the root epidermis towards the central vascular cylinder via two routes: the apoplastic pathway (through cell walls and intercellular spaces) and the symplastic pathway (through the cytoplasm of interconnected cells).\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements describes the most significant and direct physiological challenge this mutant plant would face as a result of its defective Casparian strip?\n\nA. The plant would be unable to transport any water from the soil into its vascular cylinder.\n\nB. The plant would lose the ability to selectively control which dissolved minerals from the soil enter the xylem stream.\n\nC. The plant's root cells would be unable to use active transport to accumulate essential minerals from the soil.\n\nD. The plant would be unable to generate any root pressure, a phenomenon that helps push water up the xylem.\n\nE. Water transport would be restricted exclusively to the apoplastic pathway, bypassing the cytoplasm of all root cells.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the primary physiological consequence for a plant lacking a functional Casparian strip in its root endodermis. To solve this, we must understand the specific role of the Casparian strip in the context of water and mineral uptake.\n\nStep 1: Understand the Pathways of Water and Mineral Uptake.\nWater and dissolved minerals are absorbed from the soil by the root hairs and epidermis. From there, they move across the root cortex towards the central vascular cylinder (also called the stele), where the xylem and phloem are located. This movement can occur via two main pathways:\n- **Apoplastic pathway:** Movement occurs through the non-living parts of the root, specifically the cell walls and the intercellular spaces. This pathway is non-selective, allowing water and any solutes dissolved in it to move freely by diffusion and bulk flow.\n- **Symplastic pathway:** Movement occurs through the living parts of the root. Water and selected solutes enter the cytoplasm of an epidermal or cortex cell and then move from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, which are small channels connecting the cytoplasm of adjacent cells.\n\nStep 2: Understand the Function of the Endodermis and the Casparian Strip.\nThe endodermis is a cylindrical layer of cells that surrounds the vascular cylinder. It acts as a critical checkpoint for substances moving into the plant's transport tissues. The Casparian strip is a band of suberin, a waxy waterproof substance, that is embedded in the radial and transverse cell walls of the endodermal cells. This waterproof band effectively blocks the apoplastic pathway.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Consequence of the Apoplastic Block.\nBecause the Casparian strip blocks the apoplastic pathway, any water and minerals that have been traveling through the cell walls must enter the symplast to cross the endodermis. This means they are forced to pass through the selectively permeable plasma membrane of an endodermal cell.\n\nStep 4: Relate the Membrane Crossing to Selective Uptake.\nThe plasma membrane of the endodermal cell is not freely permeable to all solutes. It is equipped with specific transport proteins that regulate the passage of minerals. The plant can thus actively transport essential minerals into the cell (and subsequently into the xylem) while preventing the entry of toxic or excess minerals. Therefore, the Casparian strip is the key anatomical feature that confers selectivity to mineral uptake into the vascular system.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the Situation in the Mutant Plant.\nThe mutant plant lacks a functional Casparian strip. This means the apoplastic pathway is not blocked at the endodermis. Water and any solutes dissolved in it can now flow uninterrupted from the soil, through the cortex's cell walls, and directly into the vascular cylinder, bypassing the selective plasma membranes of the endodermal cells.\n\nStep 6: Assess the Options.\n- **A. The plant would be unable to transport any water from the soil into its vascular cylinder.** This is incorrect. Water can still move via the symplastic pathway, and in this mutant, it can also move via the now-unblocked apoplastic pathway. Water transport into the xylem would still occur.\n- **B. The plant would lose the ability to selectively control which dissolved minerals from the soil enter the xylem stream.** This is correct. By allowing the apoplastic pathway to continue unchecked into the stele, the plant loses the crucial checkpoint at the endodermis. This leads to non-selective, uncontrolled uptake of dissolved substances, which explains the observed symptoms of nutrient toxicity even in balanced soil.\n- **C. The plant's root cells would be unable to use active transport to accumulate essential minerals from the soil.** This is incorrect. The Casparian strip is a feature of the cell wall; it does not disable the transport proteins located in the plasma membranes of the endodermal or other root cells. Those cells can still perform active transport for the symplastic pathway. The problem is that this selective pathway is now bypassed.\n- **D. The plant would be unable to generate any root pressure.** This is incorrect. Root pressure is generated by the active accumulation of solutes in the xylem, which lowers the water potential and draws water in. While the *regulation* of this process would be severely compromised, minerals could still be loaded via the symplastic path and would also leak in via the apoplastic path, so it's not true that *no* root pressure could be generated. The primary issue is the lack of selectivity, not a complete inability to accumulate solutes.\n- **E. Water transport would be restricted exclusively to the apoplastic pathway.** This is incorrect. The symplastic pathway, which involves movement through the cytoplasm of cells, remains fully functional.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and significant consequence of a defective Casparian strip is the loss of the plant's ability to regulate which soil solutes enter its vascular system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2308147"}]}
