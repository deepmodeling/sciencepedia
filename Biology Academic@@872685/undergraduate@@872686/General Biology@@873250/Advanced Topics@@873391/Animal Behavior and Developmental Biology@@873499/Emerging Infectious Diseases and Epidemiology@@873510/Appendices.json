While large-scale models often treat populations as uniformly mixed, understanding the specific structure of a contact network can reveal crucial vulnerabilities. This practice introduces a concept from network science—betweenness centrality—to identify individuals who act as critical bridges between different community clusters. By analyzing the shortest paths of transmission, you can pinpoint the nodes whose removal would most effectively fragment the network and halt an outbreak, demonstrating a powerful strategy for targeted public health interventions. [@problem_id:2292161]", "problem": "An emerging viral pathogen has been detected at a remote Antarctic research station. To devise a targeted quarantine and vaccination strategy, epidemiologists have mapped the close-contact network of all nine individuals at the station. The station consists of two main housing units, Unit Alpha and Unit Gamma, connected by a service corridor.\n\nThe individuals are: Alex, Ben, and Clara, who live and work together in Unit Alpha. Grace, Helen, and Ian, who live and work together in Unit Gamma. David, Eva, and Frank are logistics personnel who work in the connecting corridor and interact with individuals from both units.\n\nThe contact network is defined as follows:\n- In Unit Alpha, Alex, Ben, and Clara are all in close contact with each other, forming a fully connected group.\n- In Unit Gamma, Grace, Helen, and Ian are all in close contact with each other, also forming a fully connected group.\n- The connection between the units and the corridor staff is linear: Alex from Unit Alpha is in contact with David. David is in contact with Eva. Eva is in contact with Frank. Finally, Frank is in contact with all three members of Unit Gamma (Grace, Helen, and Ian).\n- There are no other contacts. For example, Eva is not in direct contact with Alex, and David is not in contact with Frank.\n\nTo prioritize interventions, public health officials want to identify the individual with the highest \"betweenness centrality.\" The betweenness centrality of an individual (a node in the network), $v$, is a measure of how often they lie on the shortest communication paths between other pairs of people.

So (F,G), (F,H), (F,I). The members of Unit Gamma are also all connected to each other: (G,H), (H,I), (G,I).\n3.  **Corridor Chain:** (A,D), (D,E), (E,F)\n\nThe structure is a clique {A,B,C} connected via A to a chain D-E-F, where F is connected to a clique {F,G,H,I}. Note that Frank (F) is part of the Unit Gamma clique.\n\nLet's analyze the betweenness centrality, $C_B(v)$, for the individuals who act as bridges: Alex, David, Eva, and Frank.\n\n**1. Calculation for Alex (A):**\nAlex connects his close contacts, Ben (B) and Clara (C), to the rest of the station network, which consists of {D, E, F, G, H, I}. Ben and Clara are not connected to anyone else directly. Therefore, any shortest path from {B, C} to {D, E, F, G, H, I} must pass through Alex.\n- The size of the first set of nodes is $|\\{B, C\\}| = 2$.\n- The size of the second set of nodes is $|\\{D, E, F, G, H, I\\}| = 6$.\nFor each pair of nodes $(s,t)$ with $s \\in \\{B,C\\}$ and $t \\in \\{D,E,F,G,H,I\\}$, there is a unique shortest path, and it includes Alex. The number of such pairs is $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\nFor each of these 12 pairs, the term $\\frac{\\sigma_{st}(A)}{\\sigma_{st}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\nAlex does not lie on any other shortest paths (e.g., the shortest path between B and C is the direct link).\nThus, the betweenness centrality for Alex is $C_B(\\text{A}) = 12$.\n\n**2. Calculation for David (D):**\nDavid connects the Unit Alpha group {A, B, C} to the rest of the station network {E, F, G, H, I}. Any shortest path from a node in the first set to a node in the second set must pass through David.\n- The size of the first set of nodes is $|\\{A, B, C\\}| = 3$.\n- The size of the second set of nodes is $|\\{E, F, G, H, I\\}| = 5$.\nThe number of such pairs is $3 \\times 5 = 15$. For each pair, there is a unique shortest path passing through David.\nThus, the betweenness centrality for David is $C_B(\\text{D}) = 15$.\n\n**3. Calculation for Eva (E):**\nEva sits in the middle of the corridor chain D-E-F. She connects everyone on the \"Alpha side\" {A, B, C, D} with everyone on the \"Gamma side\" {F, G, H, I}. Any shortest path between a node in the first set and a node in the second set must pass through Eva.\n- The size of the first set of nodes is $|\\{A, B, C, D\\}| = 4$.\n- The size of the second set of nodes is $|\\{F, G, H, I\\}| = 4$.\nThe number of such pairs is $4 \\times 4 = 16$. For each pair, the unique shortest path includes Eva.\nThus, the betweenness centrality for Eva is $C_B(\\text{E}) = 16$.\n\n**4. Calculation for Frank (F):**\nFrank connects the corridor personnel and Unit Alpha members {A, B, C, D, E} to his own close contacts in Unit Gamma {G, H, I}. Any shortest path from a node in the first set to a node in the second set must pass through Frank.\n- The size of the first set of nodes is $|\\{A, B, C, D, E\\}| = 5$.\n- The size of the second set of nodes is $|\\{G, H, I\\}| = 3$.\nThe number of such pairs is $5 \\times 3 = 15$. For each, the unique shortest path includes Frank.\nThus, the betweenness centrality for Frank is $C_B(\\text{F}) = 15$.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion:**\n- $C_B(\\text{Eva}) = 16$\n- $C_B(\\text{David}) = 15$\n- $C_B(\\text{Frank}) = 15$\n- $C_B(\\text{Alex}) = 12$\n- The centralities for B, C, G, H, I are all 0, as they are not on any shortest paths between other nodes (they are at the \"ends\" of the network branches, within cliques).\n\nEva has the highest betweenness centrality ($16$). This is because she forms the most balanced bridge in the network, connecting a group of 4 individuals to another group of 4 individuals. Her removal would break all shortest paths between these two large groups.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n- A: Frank has a high degree (connected to E, G, H, I - degree 4), but his centrality (15) is not the highest.\n- B: Alex is a crucial link, but his centrality (12) is the lowest among the bridge nodes.\n- C: Eva has the highest centrality (16), and the reasoning provided is correct – she is the bottleneck for paths between the two sides of the station.\n- D: David has high centrality (15), but it is not the maximum.\n- E: Grace is a member of a clique with low centrality (0), so this reasoning is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Eva is the highest priority individual based on betweenness centrality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2292161"}, {"introduction": "Treating rapidly mutating RNA viruses is a formidable challenge, akin to battling a constantly shape-shifting swarm.
