This practice explores shaping, or the method of successive approximations, a powerful technique in operant conditioning. By reinforcing behaviors that get progressively closer to a target action, we can build complex behavioral repertoires, as demonstrated in this classic dog training scenario [@problem_id:2298894].", "problem": "A student in an animal behavior course decides to apply their knowledge of operant conditioning to train their dog. The goal is to teach the dog a complex behavior it does not naturally perform on command: a full \"roll over\". The student plans to use the method of shaping, also known as the method of successive approximations, with a food treat as a positive reinforcer. The dog has already been reliably trained to lie down when given the verbal command \"Down\".\n\nWhich of the following training plans represents the most effective and logical application of the principle of shaping to teach the dog to roll over?\n\nA. The student says the verbal cue \"Roll Over\" and gives the dog a treat only if it performs the full, complete roll over action. This process is repeated until the dog learns the association between the command and the completed action.\n\nB. The student first commands the dog to \"Down\". Then, using a treat as a lure, they guide the dog's head towards its shoulder, causing it to shift weight onto one hip, and immediately give a treat. Once the dog reliably lies on its hip, the student withholds the treat until the dog lies completely on its side. After this step is mastered, a treat is only given for shifting its weight further onto its back, and finally, only for completing the full roll. The verbal cue \"Roll Over\" is introduced to be associated with the action only after the dog can perform the full physical roll reliably.\n\nC. The student commands the dog to \"Down\". They then hold a treat and say \"Roll Over\" repeatedly, waiting for the dog to perform the complete roll over action by random chance. The moment the dog completes the action, it receives the treat.\n\nD. The student first commands the dog to \"Down\" and gives it a treat. Then, they say \"Roll Over\" while physically pushing the dog onto its side and then over to its other side, giving it another treat after the forced movement is complete. This is repeated until the dog begins to perform the action without being pushed.\n\nE. The student first rewards the dog for obeying the \"Down\" command. Then, they reward the dog for looking attentively at the treat in their hand. Next, they reward the dog for getting back into a standing position. Finally, they attempt to teach the roll over from the standing position.", "solution": "We apply the operant conditioning principle of shaping (successive approximations): differentially reinforce behaviors that increasingly resemble the target response, withholding reinforcement for prior, easier forms once a new criterion is met. Key components include: starting from an existing behavior the dog can perform on cue (lying down), using positive reinforcement immediately upon the desired approximation, raising the criterion stepwise, fading any prompts or lures as soon as possible, and introducing the verbal cue only after the full behavior is performed reliably so that the cue gains stimulus control over the established response.\n\nEvaluate the options against these principles:\n\nA. This withholds reinforcement until the complete behavior occurs and introduces the verbal cue before the behavior is learned. The probability of a dog spontaneously performing a full roll from a verbal cue alone is very low, so this is not shaping but an inefficient capture-at-chance approach.\n\nB. This begins from a known behavior (“Down”), then uses differential reinforcement for successive approximations: shifting weight to one hip, then lying on the side, then onto the back, and finally the full roll, withholding reinforcement for earlier approximations once the next step is established. The verbal cue is introduced only after the full roll is reliably performed, which correctly transfers stimulus control. This is a textbook application of shaping using positive reinforcement and criterion advancement.\n\nC. This waits for a complete roll to occur by chance while repeatedly saying the cue. Like A, it fails to reinforce intermediate approximations and introduces the cue prematurely, making learning unlikely and inefficient.\n\nD. This uses physical prompting (pushing) rather than reinforcing voluntary successive approximations. Physical manipulation can produce compliance without the dog learning the operant sequence and is not an example of shaping as defined.\n\nE. This sequence reinforces behaviors that move away from the target (standing up) and does not construct a graded path of approximations toward rolling over. It is illogical relative to the target response and does not implement shaping.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly applies shaping with differential reinforcement of successive approximations and proper cue introduction is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2298894"}, {"introduction": "Associative learning is not just about linking one cue to one outcome; animals must learn in a world of competing stimuli. This exercise introduces the Rescorla-Wagner model, a formal framework for understanding how the predictive value of different cues changes with experience.

In this experiment, the illumination of colored lights serves as a conditioned stimulus (CS) that predicts the delivery of a food pellet, which is the unconditioned stimulus (US).

This problem explores the conflict between sexual imprinting—a learned preference for familiar individuals—and the innate tendency to avoid inbreeding with close relatives.

They hypothesize that sexual preferences are shaped by two primary, sometimes conflicting, drives: an imprinting-based attraction to familiar individuals from the rearing environment, and an innate mechanism to avoid inbreeding by preferring unrelated mates.\n\nTo test this, they conduct a complex cross-fostering experiment. Newly hatched quail chicks are placed into mixed-family broods. Each brood contains a test male, one of his biological sisters, and one unrelated \"foster sister\" from a different genetic lineage. The chicks are raised together to sexual maturity.\n\nA test male from one such brood is then placed in a custom four-chambered mate-choice arena. He is free to move about the central area for a total observation period of 1200 seconds. In each of the four peripheral chambers, separated by a transparent barrier, is a different stimulus female. The four females are categorized relative to the test male's own life history:\n1.  **Familiar Kin (FK)**: A biological sister with whom he was raised.\n2.  **Familiar Non-kin (FN)**: The foster sister with whom he was raised.\n3.  **Unfamiliar Kin (UK)**: A biological sister from his own clutch who was raised in a different brood.\n4.  **Unfamiliar Non-kin (UN)**: An unrelated female of the same age who is novel to the test male.\n\nThe researchers record the total time the male spends associating with (i.e., within a predefined proximity to the chamber of) each female. For a representative test male, the association times were recorded as follows:\n-   Time with Familiar Kin (FK): $145.0 \\text{ s}$\n-   Time with Familiar Non-kin (FN): $380.0 \\text{ s}$\n-   Time with Unfamiliar Kin (UK): $255.0 \\text{ s}$\n-   Time with Unfamiliar Non-kin (UN): $310.0 \\text{ s}$\nThe remaining time was spent in neutral zones of the arena.\n\nTo quantify the resolution of the conflict between imprinting and inbreeding avoidance, the researchers defined a \"Conflict Resolution Index\" ($CRI$). This index compares the male's preference for the female representing the most evolutionarily advantageous choice (Unfamiliar Non-kin) against his preference for the female representing the greatest conflict between the two behavioral drives (Familiar Kin). The index is defined as:\n$$CRI = \\frac{T_{UN} - T_{FK}}{T_{UN} + T_{FK}}$$\nwhere $T_{UN}$ is the association time with the Unfamiliar Non-kin female and $T_{FK}$ is the association time with the Familiar Kin female.\n\nUsing the provided data, calculate the value of the Conflict Resolution Index ($CRI$).
