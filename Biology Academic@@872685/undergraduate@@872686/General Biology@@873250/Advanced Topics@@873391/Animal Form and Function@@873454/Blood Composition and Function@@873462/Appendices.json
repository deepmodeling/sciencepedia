This condition leads to a significant increase in the patient's hematocrit, which is the volume percentage of red blood cells in the blood. Given this physiological change, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence for the patient's cardiovascular system?\n\nA. The increased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood stimulates the heart to beat more forcefully, thus increasing its workload to circulate the oxygen-rich blood more rapidly.\n\nB. The increased number of erythrocytes enhances the fluidity of the blood, leading to a decrease in vascular resistance and a reduced workload on the heart.\n\nC. The elevated hematocrit increases blood viscosity, which in turn raises the systemic vascular resistance, leading to a greater afterload that the heart must pump against.\n\nD. The heart muscle hypertrophies in response to the increased erythrocyte count, and this enlargement is the primary cause of increased blood pressure and cardiac workload.\n\nE. The excess erythrocytes cause a reflex vasodilation in the peripheral vasculature to accommodate the increased blood volume, which lowers blood pressure and decreases the heart's workload.", "solution": "Polycythemia vera causes a marked increase in hematocrit, which increases the viscosity of blood. Denote the blood viscosity by $\\eta$. Empirically, $\\eta$ increases monotonically with hematocrit $H$, so $\\frac{d\\eta}{dH}>0$.\n\nFor flow through a cylindrical vessel under laminar conditions, vascular resistance $R$ follows the Hagen–Poiseuille relation:\n$$\nR=\\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r^{4}},\n$$\nwhere $L$ is vessel length and $r$ is vessel radius. Thus, if $\\eta$ increases with elevated hematocrit, then $R$ increases proportionally.\n\nCardiovascular hemodynamics relate flow $Q$ (cardiac output, $\\mathrm{CO}$) to pressure and resistance by\n$$\nQ=\\frac{\\Delta P}{R},\\quad \\text{so}\\quad \\Delta P=Q\\,R,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the systemic circulation. Using mean arterial pressure $\\mathrm{MAP}$ and right atrial pressure $\\mathrm{RAP}$,\n$$\n\\mathrm{MAP}-\\mathrm{RAP}=\\mathrm{CO}\\times \\mathrm{SVR}.\n$$\nWith an increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) due to higher $\\eta$, to maintain a given $\\mathrm{CO}$ the heart must generate a larger $\\Delta P$, implying a higher afterload. Afterload is the pressure the ventricle must generate during ejection and is directly related to arterial pressure and SVR. Therefore, increased hematocrit leads to increased viscosity, increased SVR, and a greater afterload against which the heart must pump, increasing cardiac workload.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is incorrect because increased oxygen-carrying capacity does not directly stimulate stronger contractions; if anything, oxygen delivery per unit flow increases and would not necessitate a higher cardiac workload.\n- B is incorrect because viscosity increases with hematocrit, reducing fluidity and increasing resistance.\n- C is correct as it states the viscosity-mediated increase in SVR and afterload.\n- D is incorrect as primary hypertrophy is not directly caused by erythrocyte count; any hypertrophy would be a secondary, adaptive response to chronically increased afterload, not the primary consequence.\n- E is incorrect because the predominant immediate effect of increased hematocrit is increased viscosity and resistance, not reflex vasodilation that lowers pressure and workload.\n\nTherefore, the primary cardiovascular consequence is an increase in viscosity leading to higher SVR and afterload.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282108"}, {"introduction": "One of blood's most vital roles is maintaining the body's acid-base balance within a narrow, life-sustaining range.
