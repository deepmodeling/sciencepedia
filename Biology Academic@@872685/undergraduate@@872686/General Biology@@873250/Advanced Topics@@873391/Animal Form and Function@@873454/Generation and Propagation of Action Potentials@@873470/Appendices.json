This problem explores the counterintuitive phenomenon of anode break excitation, where an action potential is triggered by the cessation of a hyperpolarizing current. Solving this puzzle requires you to move beyond simple activation and consider the critical role of channel inactivation, revealing how a neuron's firing probability is shaped by its recent voltage history. [@problem_id:2296811]", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is investigating the properties of a large myelinated axon using a current-clamp technique. The axon has a stable resting membrane potential. The experiment consists of two phases. In the first phase, a steady, constant hyperpolarizing current is injected into the axon for a prolonged duration. The magnitude of this current is sub-threshold, meaning it is not strong enough to elicit an action potential by itself. In the second phase, this hyperpolarizing current is abruptly and instantaneously terminated. Immediately following the cessation of the current, the axon fires a single, all-or-none action potential, a phenomenon known as anode break excitation.\n\nBased on the principles of ion channel kinetics described by the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary molecular explanation for the generation of this action potential?\n\nA. The prolonged hyperpolarization removes inactivation from a significant fraction of voltage-gated sodium channels. When the current is terminated, the subsequent passive return of the membrane potential to its resting value is sufficient to open these newly available channels and trigger an action potential.\n\nB. The hyperpolarizing current causes a gradual accumulation of potassium ions in the extracellular space immediately adjacent to the axonal membrane. The abrupt termination of the current allows this local accumulation to rapidly depolarize the membrane beyond its threshold.\n\nC. The abrupt termination of the hyperpolarizing current induces a large, transient capacitive current that flows into the cell, directly and momentarily depolarizing the membrane potential past the firing threshold.\n\nD. During the prolonged hyperpolarization, voltage-gated potassium channels enter a deep closed state. Upon termination of the current, their delayed reopening results in a lower-than-normal potassium conductance, which lowers the threshold for action potential firing.\n\nE. The hyperpolarizing current increases the sensitivity of the activation gates on voltage-gated sodium channels, causing them to open at a more negative membrane potential than they would under normal resting conditions.", "solution": "We model the axon with the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism.

Because the hyperpolarization is prolonged, the gating variables approach their steady-state values at $V_{h}$:\n$$\nm \\to m_{\\infty}(V_{h}),\\quad h \\to h_{\\infty}(V_{h}),\\quad n \\to n_{\\infty}(V_{h}),\n$$\nwhere $x_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{\\alpha_{x}(V)}{\\alpha_{x}(V)+\\beta_{x}(V)}$ for $x \\in \\{m,h,n\\}$. Under hyperpolarization, standard Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics imply:\n- $m_{\\infty}(V_{h})$ is small (activation of sodium channels is reduced at negative $V$),\n- $h_{\\infty}(V_{h})$ is large (inactivation is removed, i.e., $h$ recovers toward $1$ at negative $V$),\n- $n_{\\infty}(V_{h})$ is small (potassium activation gates close at negative $V$).\nThus, the prolonged hyperpolarization “deinactivates” a substantial fraction of voltage-gated sodium channels by increasing $h$ toward $1$, while also reducing potassium availability by decreasing $n$.\n\nPhase 2 (abrupt termination of $I_{\\text{inj}}$): At $t=0$, set $I_{\\text{inj}}$ from a negative constant to $0$. Immediately after release, the gating variables remain at their hyperpolarized values as initial conditions:\n$$\nm(0^{+}) \\approx m_{\\infty}(V_{h})\\ \\text{(small)},\\quad h(0^{+}) \\approx h_{\\infty}(V_{h})\\ \\text{(large)},\\quad n(0^{+}) \\approx n_{\\infty}(V_{h})\\ \\text{(small)}.\n$$\nWith $I_{\\text{inj}}=0$, the membrane potential now evolves according to\n$$\nC \\frac{dV}{dt} = - g_{\\text{Na}} m^{3} h \\left(V - E_{\\text{Na}}\\right) - g_{\\text{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\text{K}}\\right) - g_{\\text{L}} \\left(V - E_{\\text{L}}\\right).\n$$\nBecause $h$ is large (many sodium channels are available) and $n$ is small (low potassium conductance), even a modest depolarization toward $V_{\\text{rest}}$ will rapidly increase $m$ (since $m$ has a fast time constant), causing $g_{\\text{Na}} m^{3} h$ to increase quickly. This yields a regenerative inward sodium current $-g_{\\text{Na}} m^{3} h (V - E_{\\text{Na}})$ that overcomes the relatively weak outward potassium current $-g_{\\text{K}} n^{4} (V - E_{\\text{K}})$. The positive feedback in sodium activation ($m$ increases with $V$, which further increases inward current and $V$) produces an all-or-none action potential once threshold is crossed. The essential molecular prerequisite for this anode break excitation is the removal of sodium channel inactivation (increase in $h$) during the prior hyperpolarization, making many sodium channels available to open upon release.\n\nWhy the alternatives are not primary or are incorrect:\n- Option A matches the mechanism above: hyperpolarization increases $h$ (removes inactivation). Upon release, the passive depolarization plus fast $m$ activation in the presence of high $h$ is sufficient to trigger the action potential.\n- Option B is not the primary mechanism: a steady hyperpolarizing current does not primarily cause extracellular potassium accumulation that would abruptly depolarize upon release; ionic accumulation effects are secondary and, for a single axon under current clamp, not the main driver of anode break.\n- Option C overemphasizes a capacitive transient. In current clamp, removing a constant current produces a voltage trajectory determined by membrane and channel dynamics; any capacitive current is implicit in $C \\frac{dV}{dt}$ and is not, by itself and in the absence of channel availability changes, sufficient to surpass threshold in a passive membrane.\n- Option D invokes a special “deep closed state” and delayed reopening of potassium channels. Hodgkin-Huxley potassium gates simply decrease $n$ during hyperpolarization; while low $n$ helps excitability, the primary molecular change enabling the spike is sodium deinactivation (increase in $h$), not an altered gating mode of potassium channels.\n- Option E posits a change in the intrinsic voltage sensitivity of sodium activation. In Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics, hyperpolarization changes the state occupancy ($m$ decreases, $h$ increases) but does not shift the $m_{\\infty}(V)$ curve itself. The increased excitability derives from higher $h$, not a shifted activation threshold.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and primary molecular explanation is the deinactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels during hyperpolarization, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2296811"}, {"introduction": "Every action potential, though brief, incurs a metabolic cost as the cell works to restore the ionic gradients essential for its excitability.
