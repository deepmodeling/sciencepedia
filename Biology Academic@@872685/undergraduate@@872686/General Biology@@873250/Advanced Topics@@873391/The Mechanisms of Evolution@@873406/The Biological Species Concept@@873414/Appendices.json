The primary model for defining species in this study is the Biological Species Concept (BSC), which defines species as groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. The biologist's field and lab observations on the mechanisms preventing gene flow are summarized below for each pair.\n\n*   **Pair 1:** Species *Alpha* and Species *Beta* have distinct courtship rituals. Males of Species *Alpha* perform a complex \"dance\" on a leaf surface to attract a mate. Males of Species *Beta*, which live on the same plants, attract females by producing a specific high-frequency stridulation (sound) with their legs. Females of each species are unresponsive to the courtship signals of the other.\n*   **Pair 2:** Species *Gamma* and Species *Delta* live in the same microhabitat and are morphologically almost identical. However, sperm from Species *Gamma* males cannot fertilize the eggs of Species *Delta* females because the surface proteins on the sperm do not bind to the receptors on the ovum's surface, and vice-versa.\n*   **Pair 3:** Species *Epsilon* and Species *Zeta* are observed to mate, and fertilization successfully occurs, producing a zygote. However, the resulting hybrid embryos consistently fail to complete development and die before hatching.\n*   **Pair 4:** Species *Kappa* and Species *Lambda* are nocturnal, but their periods of activity are different. Species *Kappa* is active, forages, and mates from 8 PM to 11 PM. Species *Lambda* is active from 1 AM to 4 AM. They are never active at the same time.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following options correctly identifies the primary reproductive isolating mechanism for each pair?\n\nA.

We identify the specific isolating mechanisms by matching observed barriers to standard definitions.\n\nStep 1: Analyze Pair 1.\nPrinciple: Behavioral isolation (prezygotic) occurs when differences in courtship signals or behaviors prevent mating.\nObservation: Males of Species Alpha use a visual dance; males of Species Beta use acoustic stridulation; females are unresponsive to heterospecific signals.\nConclusion: The isolating mechanism is behavioral isolation.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Pair 2.\nPrinciple: Gametic isolation (prezygotic) occurs when sperm cannot fertilize eggs due to molecular incompatibilities, such as non-matching surface proteins.\nObservation: Sperm from Gamma cannot bind to Delta eggs due to incompatible surface proteins, and vice versa.\nConclusion: The isolating mechanism is gametic isolation.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Pair 3.\nPrinciple: Hybrid inviability (postzygotic) occurs when hybrid zygotes form but fail to develop or survive; hybrid sterility would require viable but sterile offspring.\nObservation: Mating and fertilization occur, producing a zygote, but embryos die before hatching.\nConclusion: The isolating mechanism is hybrid inviability.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Pair 4.\nPrinciple: Temporal isolation (prezygotic) occurs when species are reproductively active at different times, preventing mating even in sympatry.\nObservation: Species Kappa is active from 8 PM to 11 PM; Species Lambda is active from 1 AM to 4 AM; they are never active simultaneously.\nConclusion: The isolating mechanism is temporal isolation.\n\nStep 5: Match to options.\nPair 1: Behavioral; Pair 2: Gametic; Pair 3: Hybrid Inviability; Pair 4: Temporal.

Each barrier may be individually \"leaky,\" but together they can effectively prevent gene flow. This practice challenges you to move from qualitative identification to quantitative analysis by calculating the combined strength of several isolating barriers, providing a tangible understanding of how distinct species are maintained.

Although they occupy the same geographic region, they remain distinct species. To investigate the reproductive barriers between them, the biologist conducts a series of experiments in a large, controlled habitat that mimics their natural environment. The study begins by observing 1000 instances where a male of one species approaches a female of the other species to initiate courtship.\n\nThe following quantitative observations are made:\n1.  **Behavioral Barrier**: Due to significant differences in their species-specific courtship dances and songs, only 1 out of every 5 such interspecific courtship approaches proceeds to an actual mating attempt.\n2.  **Gametic Barrier**: For the mating attempts that do occur, molecular incompatibilities between the sperm and egg proteins prevent fertilization in 80% of cases.\n3.  **Postzygotic Barrier (Embryonic)**: For the cases where fertilization is successful and a hybrid zygote forms, genetic incompatibilities during development cause 60% of the embryos to fail to hatch into larvae.\n4.  **Postzygotic Barrier (Larval)**: The hybrid larvae that do hatch are viable but possess a severely compromised immune system. When exposed to common, non-lethal microbes present in their environment, only 5% of these hybrid larvae survive to reach the adult stage.\n\nBased on the cumulative effect of these reproductive barriers, calculate the expected number of hybrid offspring that would survive to adulthood from the initial 1000 interspecific courtship encounters.", "solution": "We treat each interspecific courtship encounter as a trial that must pass sequential barriers. The probability that a given encounter yields an adult hybrid equals the product of the survival probabilities at each barrier, by the multiplication rule for independent sequential events. The expected number of adult hybrids from many independent trials equals the initial number of trials times this overall success probability, by linearity of expectation.\n\nLet the initial number of interspecific courtship encounters be $N_{0}=1000$.\n\nConvert each barrier to a survival probability:\n- Behavioral barrier: only $1$ out of every $5$ approaches proceeds to a mating attempt, so $p_{B}=\\frac{1}{5}$.\n- Gametic barrier: fertilization succeeds in $1-0.80=0.20=\\frac{1}{5}$ of mating attempts, so $p_{G}=\\frac{1}{5}$.\n- Postzygotic embryonic barrier: hatching succeeds in $1-0.60=0.40=\\frac{2}{5}$ of fertilized zygotes, so $p_{E}=\\frac{2}{5}$.\n- Postzygotic larval barrier: only $0.05=\\frac{1}{20}$ of hatched larvae survive to adulthood, so $p_{L}=\\frac{1}{20}$.\n\nThe overall success probability from approach to adult hybrid is\n$$\np_{\\text{total}}=p_{B}\\,p_{G}\\,p_{E}\\,p_{L}\n=\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right)\n=\\frac{1\\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 20}\n=\\frac{2}{2500}\n=\\frac{1}{1250}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the expected number of adult hybrids is\n$$\nN_{\\text{adult}}=N_{0}\\,p_{\\text{total}}=1000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1250}=\\frac{1000}{1250}=\\frac{4}{5}.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, carrying counts stage by stage:\n$$\n1000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5}=200,\\quad\n200 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5}=40,\\quad\n40 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}=16,\\quad\n16 \\cdot \\frac{1}{20}=\\frac{16}{20}=\\frac{4}{5},\n$$\nconsistent with the result above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$$", "id": "1968541"}, {"introduction": "Postzygotic barriers, such as the death of hybrid offspring, are not mysterious events but are rooted in genetics.

[@problem_id:1968536]", "problem": "In the field of speciation genetics, the Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (DMI) model describes how negative epistatic interactions between alleles at different loci can lead to hybrid inviability or sterility. Consider two allopatric populations of freshwater fish, Population 1 (P1) and Population 2 (P2), that have diverged from a common ancestral population. The ancestral population was genetically fixed with genotype `A_1A_1 B_1B_1`. Through evolutionary time, a new allele `A_2` arose and fixed in P1, while a new allele `B_2` arose and fixed in P2.
