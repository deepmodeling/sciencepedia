The plasmid is subjected to three separate restriction digest experiments. The DNA from each experiment is loaded into a well on an agarose gel and separated by size using gel electrophoresis. For all experiments, the digestions are allowed to proceed to completion.\n\n*   **Experiment 1:** A complete digest with the restriction enzyme HindIII results in two fragments of sizes 3.0 kb and 7.0 kb.\n*   **Experiment 2:** A complete digest with the restriction enzyme BamHI results in two fragments of sizes 2.0 kb and 8.0 kb.\n*   **Experiment 3:** A complete digest using both HindIII and BamHI simultaneously (a double digest) is performed.\n\nAssume that the recognition sequences for HindIII and BamHI are distinct and do not overlap. Which of the following sets of fragment sizes represents a possible outcome for the double digest in Experiment 3?\n\nA. 2.0 kb, 3.0 kb, 5.0 kb\nB. 1.0 kb, 2.0 kb, 3.0 kb, 4.0 kb\nC. 2.0 kb, 8.0 kb\nD. 3.0 kb, 7.0 kb\nE. 1.0 kb, 1.0 kb, 1.0 kb, 7.0 kb", "solution": "Let the circular plasmid have a total length of 10.0 kb.\n- A complete digest with HindIII produces two fragments (3.0 kb and 7.0 kb), indicating there are two HindIII sites.\n- A complete digest with BamHI produces two fragments (2.0 kb and 8.0 kb), indicating there are two BamHI sites.\n- A double digest with both enzymes will have a total of four cut sites, producing four fragments whose lengths must sum to 10.0 kb. This immediately eliminates options A (3 fragments), C (2 fragments), and D (2 fragments). We only need to consider options B and E.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we must determine the relative positions of the four cut sites. There are two main possibilities for the arrangement of the sites: they alternate (e.g., H-B-H-B) or they are clustered (e.g., H-H-B-B).\n\n**Case 1: Clustered arrangement (H-H-B-B)**\nIn this arrangement, the four restriction sites divide the circle into four fragments. Let their sizes be $f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4$ in order around the plasmid.\n- The two HindIII sites are adjacent, separated by one fragment, say $f_1$. The single HindIII digest would produce fragments of size $f_1$ and $(f_2+f_3+f_4)$. So, we must have $\\{f_1, f_2+f_3+f_4\\} = \\{3.0, 7.0\\}$.\n- The two BamHI sites are also adjacent, separated by one fragment, say $f_3$. The single BamHI digest would produce fragments of size $f_3$ and $(f_1+f_2+f_4)$. So, we must have $\\{f_3, f_1+f_2+f_4\\} = \\{2.0, 8.0\\}$.\n\nLet's test if Option B, with fragments {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}, fits this model.\nWe need to assign one fragment to be 3.0 kb (for HindIII) and another to be 2.0 kb (for BamHI). Let's assume $f_1=3.0$ kb and $f_3=2.0$ kb.\nThe remaining fragments must be $f_2$ and $f_4$, which from the set {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0} would be 1.0 kb and 4.0 kb. Let $f_2=1.0$ and $f_4=4.0$.\nThe four fragments are {3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0}. Let's check if this is consistent:\n- **HindIII digest:** The fragments are $f_1=3.0$ kb and $(f_2+f_3+f_4) = 1.0+2.0+4.0 = 7.0$ kb. This matches the {3.0, 7.0} requirement.\n- **BamHI digest:** The fragments are $f_3=2.0$ kb and $(f_1+f_2+f_4) = 3.0+1.0+4.0 = 8.0$ kb. This matches the {2.0, 8.0} requirement.\nSince we found a consistent arrangement for the fragments in Option B, this is a possible outcome.\n\n**Case 2: Analysis of Option E**\nOption E proposes fragments {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 7.0}. Let's test this set.\n- **Clustered model (H-H-B-B):** Can we find fragments $f_1$ and $f_3$ from this set to be our single-digest fragments? Let's try $f_1=7.0$ and $f_3=1.0$. The remaining fragments are {1.0, 1.0}. Let $f_2=1.0, f_4=1.0$.\n  - H-digest gives $f_1=7.0$ and $f_2+f_3+f_4=1.0+1.0+1.0=3.0$. This works for the HindIII digest: {3.0, 7.0}.\n  - B-digest gives $f_3=1.0$ and $f_1+f_2+f_4=7.0+1.0+1.0=9.0$. This gives {1.0, 9.0}, which does not match the required {2.0, 8.0}. This fails.\n  Trying other assignments will also fail. For instance, you cannot pick a 3.0 kb or 2.0 kb fragment from the set {1,1,1,7} to be $f_1$ or $f_3$.\n- **Alternating model (H-B-H-B):** The fragments from the HindIII digest are sums of adjacent pairs ($f_1+f_2$ and $f_3+f_4$). The fragments from the BamHI digest are also sums of adjacent pairs ($f_2+f_3$ and $f_4+f_1$).\n  - With fragments {1,1,1,7}, any sum of two adjacent fragments will involve either two 1s (sum=2), or a 1 and a 7 (sum=8).\n  - So, we can obtain H-digest or B-digest fragments of {2,8}, but we cannot obtain {3,7}. Option E is therefore impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible outcome is Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2296246"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply mapping a piece of DNA, restriction analysis is a critical tool for verifying the construction of recombinant plasmids.

The fragment sizes obtained are the lengths of the arcs between consecutive $HindIII$ sites around the circle, and these arc lengths must sum to the total plasmid length $L$.\n\nIn the recombinant plasmid, there are exactly two $HindIII$ sites:\n- One in the vector at position $200$ (unchanged).\n- One within the insert (as specified), whose position relative to the $EcoRI$ junction depends on orientation.\n\nLet the $EcoRI$ cloning site in the vector be at position $1000$. There are two $EcoRI$ junctions after insertion, but the relevant one for orientation is the junction from position $1000$ into the insert when traveling clockwise.

Solving it demonstrates how these techniques are combined to investigate sophisticated biological questions and unravel intricate molecular events.", "problem": "A virologist is studying a newly discovered temperate bacteriophage, named Phage Zeta, which has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome with a total length of 48.0 kb. The cohesive ends of the linear genome allow it to circularize upon entering a host bacterium. The restriction maps for two enzymes, BamHI and HindIII, on the linear Phage Zeta genome have been determined. The coordinates of the restriction sites are measured in kilobases (kb) from the left end (coordinate 0.0 kb) to the right end (coordinate 48.0 kb).\n\n- **BamHI restriction sites are located at:** 5.0 kb, 20.0 kb, and 45.0 kb.\n- **HindIII restriction sites are located at:** 10.0 kb, 18.0 kb, and 30.0 kb.\n\nPhage Zeta can integrate its genome into the host chromosome to form a lysogen. Integration occurs via a single site-specific recombination event between the phage attachment site (`attP`) on the phage genome and the bacterial attachment site (`attB`) on the host chromosome. This event happens after the phage genome has circularized.\n\nThe `attB` site on the host chromosome is flanked by known restriction sites. Relative to the `attB` integration point, the nearest BamHI sites are located 4.0 kb to the left and 6.0 kb to the right.

The nearest host restriction sites are known relative to the bacterial attachment site: for BamHI, $4.0$ kb to the left and $6.0$ kb to the right; for HindIII, $2.0$ kb to the left and $7.0$ kb to the right. Thus, in the integrated chromosome, reaching the $x^{-}$ end contributes the right-host distance (BamHI $6.0$, HindIII $7.0$), and reaching the $x^{+}$ end contributes the left-host distance (BamHI $4.0$, HindIII $2.0$).\n\nThe probe hybridizes to phage coordinates $12.0$–$14.0$ kb, which lie within:\n- the BamHI phage fragment bounded by sites at $5.0$ kb and $20.0$ kb (size $20.0-5.0=15.0$ kb in the free circular phage),\n- the HindIII phage fragment bounded by sites at $10.0$ kb and $18.0$ kb (size $18.0-10.0=8.0$ kb in the free circular phage).\n\nBecause the observed probe-hybridizing fragment sizes in the lysogen are $17.0$ kb (BamHI) and $13.0$ kb (HindIII), the integration break $x$ must lie within both of those phage fragments; otherwise, the intact internal phage fragments of sizes $15.0$ kb (BamHI) and $8.0$ kb (HindIII) would have been observed.\n\nCompute the BamHI fragment length containing the probe after integration when $x \\in (5.0,20.0)$:\n- If $x \\in (12.0,20.0)$ (break to the right of the probe), the left boundary remains the phage BamHI site at $5.0$ kb, and the right boundary is at the $x^{-}$ prophage end followed by the nearest right-host BamHI site $6.0$ kb away.
