This exercise [@problem_id:2311191] challenges you to devise such a strategy by thinking like a molecular engineer, turning a seemingly random single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) into a powerful tool. You will see how the rigid requirement of a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) can be exploited to exclusively target a mutant allele, demonstrating a key principle in designing next-generation therapeutics.", "problem": "A patient is afflicted with a severe neurodegenerative condition caused by a dominant, gain-of-function mutation in the gene *NEURO-X*. As a new therapeutic strategy, researchers are planning to use the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to specifically disrupt the mutant allele, leaving the wild-type allele functional. The chosen nuclease is from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9), which requires a 5'-NGG-3' Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) to bind and cleave DNA, where 'N' can be any nucleotide.\n\nDirectly targeting the disease-causing mutation is difficult due to the high sequence similarity between the alleles. However, genomic analysis revealed a benign Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) that is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the pathogenic mutation. This SNP creates a unique PAM site on the mutant allele that is absent on the wild-type (WT) allele.\n\nThe DNA sequences for a portion of the *NEURO-X* gene containing this strategic SNP are shown below for both alleles. The position of the SNP is highlighted in bold.\n\n**Wild-Type (WT) Allele:**\n5'-...CATTCTGGACTGACTCGTCAT**A**GAATTCG...-3'\n3'-...GTAAGACCTGACGAGCAGTAT**T**CTTAAGC...-5'\n\n**Mutant Allele:**\n5'-...CATTCTGGACTGACTCGTCA**G**GAATTCG...-3'\n3'-...GTAAGACCTGACGAGCAGTA**C**CTTAAGC...-5'\n\nTo achieve selective disruption of the mutant *NEURO-X* allele, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) must be designed. What is the required 20-nucleotide guide sequence that should be part of this sgRNA? Provide this guide sequence as a DNA sequence written in the 5' to 3' orientation.", "solution": "The goal is to exploit the SNP to create a unique target site for SpCas9 on the mutant allele. SpCas9 requires a 5'-NGG-3' Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) immediately downstream of its target sequence.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Wild-Type (WT) Allele:** The sequence surrounding the SNP is 5'-...TCAT**A**GAATTCG...-3'. The sequence at the critical position and just downstream is `AGA`. This does not match the `NGG` PAM motif. Therefore, SpCas9 will not bind or cut here.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mutant Allele:** The sequence is 5'-...TCGTCA**G**GAATTCG...-3'. The A-to-G mutation creates the sequence `GGA`. This `GGA` sequence is a valid `NGG` PAM (where N=G). This PAM is absent in the WT allele, creating a mutant-specific target site.\n\n3.  **Design the Guide Sequence:** The guide sequence is the 20-nucleotide sequence directly upstream (5'-ward) of the PAM. The PAM is `GGA`. The 20 nucleotides upstream of `GGA` on the same strand are:\n    `CATTCTGGACTGACTCGTCA`\n\nTherefore, an sgRNA containing this 20-nucleotide guide sequence will direct SpCas9 to bind and cleave only the mutant allele, achieving the desired therapeutic outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CATTCTGGACTGACTCGTCA}$$", "id": "2311191"}, {"introduction": "When CRISPR-Cas9 creates a double-strand break, the cell's fate hangs in the balance, determined by a race between two repair pathways: the error-prone Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and the precise Homology-Directed Repair (HDR). For applications like gene correction, favoring HDR is critical, yet it is often the less efficient pathway. This practice problem [@problem_id:1480251] provides a quantitative framework to understand this competition and demonstrates how manipulating cell biology—specifically, synchronizing cells in the S/G2 phase—can dramatically shift the odds in favor of precision editing.", "problem": "A genetics research team is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to perform a targeted gene insertion in a culture of mammalian cells. The goal is to insert a reporter gene by leveraging the cell's own DNA repair mechanisms. The Cas9 nuclease is programmed to create a specific double-strand break (DSB) at the target genomic locus. For the purpose of this problem, assume that a DSB is successfully induced in every cell in the population.\n\nFollowing the DSB, the cell can repair the break via one of two major competing pathways:\n1.  **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ):** An error-prone pathway that ligates the broken ends back together, often introducing small insertions or deletions. This pathway is active throughout all phases of the cell cycle.\n2.  **Homology-Directed Repair (HDR):** A high-fidelity pathway that uses a homologous DNA sequence as a template to repair the break. This is the desired pathway for precise gene insertion, as the researchers provide an external DNA template containing the reporter gene. HDR is predominantly active only during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle.\n\nThe team begins with a large, asynchronous population of cells. In this population, a fraction $f_{G1}$ of the cells are in the G1 phase, and the remaining fraction, $f_{S/G2}$, are in the S or G2 phases, where $f_{G1} + f_{S/G2} = 1$. In G1 phase cells, all DSBs are repaired by NHEJ, meaning the probability of HDR is zero. In S/G2 phase cells, a DSB has a constant probability $p_H$ of being repaired by HDR, and a probability $1-p_H$ of being repaired by NHEJ.\n\nTo improve the efficiency of gene insertion, the team treats the culture with a chemical agent that synchronizes the cells. After this treatment, the new distribution of cells is such that a fraction $f'_{G1}$ are in the G1 phase and the remaining fraction, $f'_{S/G2}$, are in the S/G2 phases, where $f'_{G1} + f'_{S/G2} = 1$.\n\nDetermine the fold-increase in the total number of cells successfully modified by HDR in the synchronized culture compared to the asynchronous culture. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given fractional parameters.", "solution": "Let the total number of cells be $N$. A DSB is induced in every cell by assumption.\n\nIn the asynchronous culture, the probability that a given cell repairs by HDR is zero in G1 and $p_{H}$ in S/G2.

Since editing in a cell population is often incomplete, the result is a genetic mosaic, a mixture of edited and unedited cells. This practice [@problem_id:2311239] places you in the role of a researcher analyzing the data, asking you to predict the signature of a heterozygous edit in a Sanger sequencing chromatogram. Understanding how to interpret this \"messy\" signal is a fundamental skill for validating any CRISPR experiment.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to engineer a specific genetic modification in a line of diploid human cells. The goal is to introduce a small, 5-base-pair deletion into an exon of a target gene. The editing machinery is delivered to the cells, and the cells are left to repair the DNA break via the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway.\n\nAfterward, the researcher isolates a single cell clone, which is presumed to be heterozygous for the modification—meaning one allele of the target gene contains the 5-base-pair deletion, while the other allele remains wild-type (unedited).\n\nTo verify this outcome, the researcher performs the following steps:\n1.  Genomic DNA is extracted from the clonal cell population.\n2.  The region of the gene flanking the intended deletion site is amplified using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with a single pair of primers.\n3.  The resulting pool of PCR products is then analyzed by Sanger sequencing, using one of the primers from the PCR step as the sequencing primer.\n\nSanger sequencing generates a chromatogram where fluorescent peaks correspond to the identity of the nucleotide at each position in the sequence. Given that the sequenced sample contains an equal mixture of PCR products from both the wild-type and the deleted allele, which of the following descriptions best characterizes the expected Sanger sequencing chromatogram for the region containing the edit?\n\nA. The chromatogram will show a clean, readable sequence that abruptly stops at the beginning of the 5-base-pair deletion, with no signal afterward.\n\nB. The chromatogram will be completely unreadable, with overlapping and noisy peaks starting from the very first base sequenced after the primer.\n\nC. The chromatogram will show a clean, readable sequence up to the point of the deletion. Immediately following the deletion site, the sequence will become unreadable, with a jumble of overlapping peaks of multiple colors.\n\nD. The chromatogram will show a clean, readable sequence throughout the entire amplified region, but with a noticeable 5-base-pair gap or blank space where the deletion occurred.\n\nE. The chromatogram will show two distinct, parallel sets of clean peaks after the deletion site, allowing the user to simultaneously read both the wild-type and the deleted sequence.", "solution": "- The PCR amplifies both alleles with the same primer pair, producing two amplicon species: one wild-type and one carrying a 5-base-pair deletion. Because the clone is heterozygous, these two templates are present at approximately equal abundance.\n\n- In Sanger sequencing, a single sequencing primer is extended on a mixed template pool. The fluorescent trace at each position reflects the superposition of terminated fragments generated from all templates present. If all templates share the same sequence at a given position, the chromatogram shows a single clean peak for that base. If templates differ at a position, overlapping peaks appear.\n\n- Upstream of the deletion, the wild-type and deleted alleles are identical in sequence and length alignment relative to the primer. Therefore, extension products from both templates contribute the same base at each position, yielding clean, single peaks in the chromatogram up to the cut site.\n\n- At the deletion site, the two templates diverge in length and sequence register. The deleted allele is shorter by 5 bases relative to the wild-type. This introduces a phase shift: bases from the deleted allele after the break are offset by 5 positions relative to the wild-type sequence.\n\n- In Sanger electropherograms, such a phase shift causes the signals from the two templates to overlap out of register. The chromatogram immediately beyond the deletion becomes a composite of two different sequences shifted relative to each other, producing multiple, overlapping peaks at each nominal position. This appears as a mixed, noisy, and progressively degraded trace that is not cleanly readable.\n\n- Consequently, the expected appearance is a clean, readable sequence up to the deletion, followed by unreadable, overlapping peaks starting immediately after the deletion site.\n\n- This matches option C. Options A, D, and E are inconsistent with Sanger trace behavior (no abrupt stop, no blank gap, and no separate parallel peak sets). Option B is incorrect because the trace is clean before the divergence point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2311239"}]}
