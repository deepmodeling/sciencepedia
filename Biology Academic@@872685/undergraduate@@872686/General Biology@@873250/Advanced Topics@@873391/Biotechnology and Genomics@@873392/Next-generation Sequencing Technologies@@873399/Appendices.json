After a sequencing run, each base call (A, T, C, or G) in a read is assigned a quality score to indicate the confidence in its identification. The most common metric is the Phred quality score, $Q$. This score is logarithmically related to the probability that a base call is incorrect, denoted as $P_e$.

Paired-end sequencing is a key strategy that enables the detection of these events by analyzing the mapping distance between two linked reads. This problem [@problem_id:2304570] illustrates how an unexpected distance between a read pair can serve as a tell-tale signature of a genomic deletion, allowing you to calculate its size.", "problem": "In a genomics research project, a scientist is analyzing a human DNA sample using a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform with a paired-end sequencing strategy. A DNA library was prepared by fragmenting the genomic DNA, and size selection was performed to create a library of fragments with a mean length of $L_{frag} = 485$ base pairs (bp), with a standard deviation of $\\sigma = 45$ bp. The sequencer generates a pair of reads for each fragment, one from each end. These read pairs are then aligned to the human reference genome.\n\nDuring the analysis of the alignment data, one specific read pair catches the scientist's attention. Both reads from this pair map uniquely to chromosome 7 with the expected forward-reverse orientation. However, the mapped positions are unusually far apart. The total distance on the reference genome, measured from the 5'-most coordinate of the forward read to the 3'-most coordinate of the reverse read, is observed to be $D_{map} = 5320$ bp.\n\nAssuming this anomalously large mapped distance is caused by a single, contiguous heterozygous deletion in the DNA sample relative to the reference genome, calculate the size of this deletion. Express your answer in base pairs (bp).", "solution": "Define $s$ as the size of the deletion (in base pairs). In paired-end sequencing, for a properly oriented pair without structural variation, the mapped outer distance on the reference (from the 5'-most base of the forward read to the 3'-most base of the reverse read) equals the physical fragment length of the DNA molecule from which the reads were generated. Denote this fragment length by $L$. Thus, in the absence of variation, one expects\n$$\nD_{map} = L.\n$$\nIf there is a deletion of size $s$ in the sample relative to the reference and the fragment spans this deletion, then the reference contains an additional contiguous segment of length $s$ between the read anchors that is absent in the sample molecule. Consequently, the mapped distance on the reference is increased by $s$:\n$$\nD_{map} = L + s.\n$$\nSolving for the deletion size gives\n$$\ns = D_{map} - L.\n$$\nFor a typical fragment drawn from the library, $L$ is well-approximated by the library mean $L_{frag}$; therefore, the point estimate for the deletion size is\n$$\n\\hat{s} = D_{map} - L_{frag}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $D_{map} = 5320$ bp and $L_{frag} = 485$ bp,\n$$\n\\hat{s} = 5320 - 485 = 4835 \\text{ bp}.\n$$\nThe provided standard deviation characterizes the library insert-size dispersion but does not alter the point estimate from this single anomalous pair.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4835}$$", "id": "2304570"}]}
