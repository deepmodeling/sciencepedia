These species are morphologically identical but reproductively isolated. Based on the geological dating of a volcanic ash layer that separated their ancestral population, it is estimated that their lineages diverged from a common ancestor approximately $T = 4.50$ million years ago.\n\nFor their molecular analysis, the researchers sequenced a large set of neutral, non-coding genomic regions from both species. By aligning these sequences, they calculated the average number of nucleotide differences per site. This measure of genetic distance, known as sequence divergence ($K$), was found to be $K = 0.054$.\n\nAssuming a molecular clock model holds true for these neutral regions, calculate the average rate of nucleotide substitution per site per year.

Under a neutral molecular clock for two lineages diverging from a common ancestor and evolving at the same per-lineage substitution rate $r$ (in substitutions per site per year), the expected divergence is the sum of substitutions accumulated independently in each lineage:\n$$\nK = r T + r T = 2 r T.\n$$\nSolving for the per-lineage substitution rate,\n$$\nr = \\frac{K}{2 T}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\nr = \\frac{0.054}{2 \\times 4.50 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{0.054}{9.00 \\times 10^{6}}.\n$$\nCompute the quotient in scientific notation:\n$$\nr = 6.00 \\times 10^{-9}.\n$$\nThus, the average rate of nucleotide substitution is $6.00 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year, rounded to three significant figures as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.00 \\times 10^{-9}}$$", "id": "2307586"}, {"introduction": "A robust species tree can only be built by comparing the correct genes—orthologs—that trace the history of speciation.

Extensive prior research has firmly established that the true species phylogeny is `((A, B), C)`, which indicates that species A and B share a more recent common ancestor with each other than either does with species C.\n\nIn their analysis, the researcher focuses on a gene family named 'Zingiberene synthase-like' (ZSL). The evolutionary history of this gene family has been determined as follows:\n1. In the last common ancestor of all three species, an ancestral gene, `ZSL_anc`, underwent a gene duplication event, giving rise to two distinct paralogous lineages, `ZSL_alpha` and `ZSL_beta`.\n2. Following this duplication, a speciation event occurred that separated the lineage leading to species C from the common ancestor of species A and B.\n3. In the lineage that led to species C, the `ZSL_beta` gene was lost. The `ZSL_alpha` gene was retained and is now found as `ZSL_C_alpha` in species C.\n4. The common ancestor of species A and B retained both the `ZSL_alpha` and `ZSL_beta` paralogs.\n5. Finally, the speciation event that separated species A and B occurred. As a result, species A contains genes `ZSL_A_alpha` and `ZSL_A_beta`, and species B contains genes `ZSL_B_alpha` and `ZSL_B_beta`.\n\nThe researcher's objective is to reconstruct the species tree using a method that requires identifying single-copy orthogroups (a set containing exactly one gene from each species, where all genes are true orthologs). They use a high-throughput automated software pipeline for this task. Due to a technical artifact related to sequence composition, the pipeline makes an error and incorrectly identifies the set `{ZSL_A_beta, ZSL_B_alpha, ZSL_C_alpha}` as a valid single-copy orthogroup.\n\nUnaware of this critical error in orthogroup assignment, the researcher proceeds to build a phylogenetic tree based on the sequence alignment of these three genes, assuming they are true orthologs. If this resulting gene tree's topology is then interpreted as representing the species phylogeny, which of the following evolutionary relationships for species A, B, and C will be incorrectly inferred?\n\nA. `((A, B), C)`\nB. `((A, C), B)`\nC. `((B, C), A)`\nD. A three-way polytomy `(A, B, C)`, indicating that the relationships cannot be resolved.", "solution": "We begin from the established species phylogeny, which is $((A,B),C)$. The ZSL gene family experienced a duplication in the last common ancestor of all three species, producing two paralogs, which we denote as $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. By definition, this duplication predates all subsequent speciations, so in the gene tree the deepest split is between the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ clades.\n\nAfter the duplication, the speciation dividing $C$ from the ancestor of $A$ and $B$ occurred. Along the $C$ lineage, the $\\beta$ copy was lost, leaving only $C_{\\alpha}$. In the $AB$ ancestor, both copies were retained and subsequently passed to $A$ and $B$, yielding $A_{\\alpha},A_{\\beta}$ in $A$ and $B_{\\alpha},B_{\\beta}$ in $B$.\n\nThus, the true gene tree structure is:\n- A duplication at the root that splits the tree into two clades: the $\\alpha$ clade and the $\\beta$ clade.\n- Within the $\\alpha$ clade, the three orthologs follow the species topology $((A_{\\alpha},B_{\\alpha}),C_{\\alpha})$.\n- Within the $\\beta$ clade, only $A_{\\beta}$ and $B_{\\beta}$ are present (since $C_{\\beta}$ was lost), forming a two-taxon clade.\n\nThe pipeline erroneously selects the set $\\{A_{\\beta},B_{\\alpha},C_{\\alpha}\\}$ as a single-copy orthogroup. When a phylogenetic tree is built on these three sequences, standard sequence-based methods will cluster sequences by the more recent common ancestry within the same paralog because the duplication predates the speciations; hence, the divergence between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is deeper than the divergences within the $\\alpha$ lineage. Consequently, $B_{\\alpha}$ and $C_{\\alpha}$ (both $\\alpha$ paralogs) will group together as sisters, with $A_{\\beta}$ (a $\\beta$ paralog) as the outgroup. The inferred gene tree on these three tips is therefore $((B_{\\alpha},C_{\\alpha}),A_{\\beta})$.\n\nIf this gene tree is then (incorrectly) interpreted as the species tree by replacing each tip with its species label and ignoring paralogy, the inferred species relationship becomes $((B,C),A)$.

This practice introduces the use of model comparison to ask a precise biological question: do different parts of a protein evolve under different selective pressures?

Their central hypothesis is that amino acid residues on the solvent-exposed surface of the protein evolve at a different rate compared to residues buried in the protein's hydrophobic core, due to differing functional and structural constraints.\n\nTo test this, they perform a phylogenomic analysis on a multiple sequence alignment of 50 `bla` gene orthologs. They use codon-based models of evolution to estimate the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ($d_N/d_S$ or $\\omega$). A ratio $\\omega < 1$ suggests purifying selection, $\\omega = 1$ suggests neutral evolution, and $\\omega > 1$ suggests positive (diversifying) selection.\n\nTwo competing models are fitted to the data:\n\n1.  **Null Model (M0):** This model assumes a single, uniform $d_N/d_S$ ratio ($\\omega_0$) for all codon sites across the protein. The maximum log-likelihood (lnL) for this model was found to be $\\text{lnL}_0 = -8750.50$, with an estimated $\\omega_0 = 0.25$.\n\n2.  **Alternative Model (M_site):** This model partitions the codon sites into two classes based on a solved crystal structure: 'buried' and 'exposed'. It then estimates a separate $d_N/d_S$ ratio for each class ($\\omega_{buried}$ and $\\omega_{exposed}$). The maximum log-likelihood for this model was found to be $\\text{lnL}_{site} = -8744.00$, with estimated ratios $\\omega_{buried} = 0.10$ and $\\omega_{exposed} = 0.45$.\n\nTo determine if the Alternative Model provides a statistically significant improvement in fit over the Null Model, a Likelihood Ratio Test is required. The test statistic is compared against a chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) distribution. The degrees of freedom for the test are equal to the difference in the number of free parameters between the two models. In this case, the M_site model has one additional free parameter (a second $d_N/d_S$ ratio) compared to the M0 model.\n\nUsing the provided data and the table of critical $\\chi^2$ values below, evaluate the hypothesis.

The test is significant at $p < 0.05$ but not at $p < 0.01$. This provides weak support for the hypothesis that exposed residues evolve faster.\nE. The Alternative Model (M_site) fits the data better, but the result is not statistically significant because the Likelihood Ratio Test statistic must be compared with 2 degrees of freedom, for which the critical value is not met.", "solution": "We are comparing a nested Null Model (M0) and an Alternative Model (M_site) using a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT).

The estimates $\\omega_{\\text{buried}}=0.10$ and $\\omega_{\\text{exposed}}=0.45$ are both less than $1$, indicating overall purifying selection, with exposed residues having a larger $\\omega$ and therefore evolving faster (weaker constraint) than buried residues.
