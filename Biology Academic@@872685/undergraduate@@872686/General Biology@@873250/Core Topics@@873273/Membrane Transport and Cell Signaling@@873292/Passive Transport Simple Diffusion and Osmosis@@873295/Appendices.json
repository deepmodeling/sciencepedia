This phenomenon is fundamental to life, and this practice [@problem_id:2306779] examines it through a familiar kitchen scenario: a limp celery stalk regaining its crispness in water. Analyzing this process will help you connect the abstract concept of water potential to the tangible mechanical properties of plant tissues, such as turgor pressure.", "problem": "A celery stalk is left on a kitchen counter for a day and becomes limp and flexible. It is then placed in a large beaker of pure, distilled water. After a few hours, the celery stalk is observed to be rigid and crisp. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for this change in the celery's texture?\n\nA. The cytoplasm of the celery cells has a higher concentration of solutes than the surrounding distilled water. This difference in water potential causes a net movement of water into the cells via osmosis, increasing their turgor pressure and making the stalk firm.\n\nB. Solutes, such as salts and sugars, diffuse out of the celery cells and into the distilled water. This process of equilibration hardens the cell walls, leading to the observed rigidity of the stalk.\n\nC. The celery cells utilize active transport, powered by cellular energy, to pump water molecules from the hypotonic surroundings into the cells, thereby increasing their internal volume and making the stalk rigid.\n\nD. Water enters the celery cells through osmosis, causing them to swell and eventually burst (cytolysis). The remnants of the burst cells aggregate to form a rigid structure.\n\nE. The distilled water is absorbed into the spaces between the plant cells and into the vascular tissues through capillary action, similar to how a sponge soaks up liquid. This physical absorption of water is solely responsible for the stalk becoming firm.", "solution": "1. Identify the relevant physical principle: water movement across a semipermeable membrane is governed by osmosis, which is driven by gradients in water potential. For a plant cell, water potential is given by $\\Psi_{w}=\\Psi_{s}+\\Psi_{p}$, where $\\Psi_{s}$ is the solute (osmotic) potential and $\\Psi_{p}$ is the pressure (turgor) potential. By convention, $\\Psi_{s}\\leq 0$ and becomes more negative as solute concentration increases; $\\Psi_{p}\\geq 0$ in turgid plant cells.\n2. Characterize the initial state: after a day on the counter, cells have lost water to the drier environment, lowering $\\Psi_{p}$ toward $0$ and possibly becoming flaccid. The intracellular solute concentration remains relatively high, so $\\Psi_{s,\\text{cell}}$ is negative, and $\\Psi_{w,\\text{cell}}=\\Psi_{s,\\text{cell}}+\\Psi_{p,\\text{cell}}$ is relatively low.\n3. Characterize the external solution: pure distilled water has negligible solute, so $\\Psi_{s,\\text{ext}}\\approx 0$ and, absent applied pressure, $\\Psi_{p,\\text{ext}}=0$. Thus $\\Psi_{w,\\text{ext}}=\\Psi_{s,\\text{ext}}+\\Psi_{p,\\text{ext}}\\approx 0$.\n4. Establish the driving force: because $\\Psi_{w,\\text{ext}} > \\Psi_{w,\\text{cell}}$ (external closer to $0$, internal negative), water moves into the cells by osmosis down the water potential gradient until equilibrium. Symbolically, net influx occurs while $\\Psi_{w,\\text{ext}}-\\Psi_{w,\\text{cell}} > 0$.\n5. Mechanistic detail: as water enters, the cell volume increases against the rigid cell wall, raising $\\Psi_{p,\\text{cell}}$. The process continues until $\\Psi_{w,\\text{ext}}=\\Psi_{s,\\text{cell}}+\\Psi_{p,\\text{cell}}$, i.e., the increase in $\\Psi_{p,\\text{cell}}$ balances the negative $\\Psi_{s,\\text{cell}}$. The elevated $\\Psi_{p,\\text{cell}}$ is the turgor pressure that renders tissues rigid and crisp.\n6. Symbolic relation for solute potential (no numerical substitution): $\\Psi_{s}=-i C R T$, where $i$ is the van ’t Hoff factor, $C$ is solute molar concentration, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is absolute temperature. In distilled water, $C_{\\text{ext}}\\approx 0$, so $\\Psi_{s,\\text{ext}}\\approx 0$, reinforcing step 4.\n7. Exclusion of alternatives:\n   - Option B is incorrect: diffusion of solutes out is neither necessary nor primarily responsible; rigidity arises from increased $\\Psi_{p}$, not from chemical hardening of cell walls.\n   - Option C is incorrect: water transport is passive via osmosis; cells do not use active transport to pump water, although they may use channels (aquaporins) that do not expend metabolic energy.\n   - Option D is incorrect: plant cell walls prevent cytolysis under hypotonic conditions; instead, cells become turgid rather than bursting.\n   - Option E is incomplete and misleading: while capillary and apoplastic movement can distribute water, the crucial change in texture is due to cellular turgor from osmotic uptake, not solely bulk physical absorption.\n8. Therefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is that the intracellular solute concentration is higher than that of distilled water, creating a water potential gradient that drives osmosis into the cells, increasing turgor pressure and firming the stalk, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2306779"}, {"introduction": "This problem moves from a qualitative understanding of osmosis to quantitative prediction, introducing a critical subtlety: the number of osmotically active particles a solute produces upon dissolving.
