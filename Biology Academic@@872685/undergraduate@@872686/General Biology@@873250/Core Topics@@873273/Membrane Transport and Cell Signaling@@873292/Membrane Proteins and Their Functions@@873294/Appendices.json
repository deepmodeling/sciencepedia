This exercise explores the critical link between a protein's amino acid sequence and its mechanical function. By considering the replacement of a tiny, flexible glycine residue with a large, bulky tryptophan at a \"hinge\" point, you will develop an intuition for how subtle changes in protein structure can dramatically impact the large-scale conformational changes necessary for transport [@problem_id:2302642].", "problem": "A newly characterized membrane protein, the L-serine uniporter \"SerT,\" is responsible for transporting the amino acid L-serine across the cell membrane. Structural and functional studies reveal that SerT operates via the \"alternating access model.\" In this model, the transporter exposes a substrate-binding site to one side of the membrane (outward-facing), binds L-serine, and then undergoes a large conformational change to an \"occluded\" state where the substrate is not accessible from either side. Finally, it transitions to an \"inward-facing\" conformation to release the substrate into the cytoplasm before resetting. A critical part of this conformational change involves the rocking motion of transmembrane alpha-helix 7 (TM7). Sequence alignments with homologous transporters show a universally conserved glycine residue at position 284 (G284) located in the middle of TM7, which appears to function as a molecular hinge facilitating this rocking motion.\n\nA site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed, creating a mutant version of the protein, G284W, where the glycine at position 284 is replaced by a tryptophan. Assuming the mutant protein is correctly folded and inserted into the plasma membrane, which of the following statements describes the most likely direct consequence of this mutation on the transporter's functional cycle?\n\nA. The transporter's maximum transport rate (V_max) for L-serine will be significantly increased.\n\nB. The transporter will be functionally locked or severely impaired in its ability to transition between the outward-facing and inward-facing states.\n\nC. The transporter will lose its specificity and begin transporting other larger amino acids in addition to L-serine.\n\nD. The affinity of the transporter for L-serine (inversely related to K_m) will increase dramatically, but V_max will remain unaffected.\n\nE. The G284W mutation will convert the uniporter into an active transporter that requires ATP hydrolysis to function.", "solution": "We analyze the transporter’s mechanism and the structural role of residue G284, then infer kinetic consequences of the G284W mutation.\n\n1) Mechanistic framework: In an alternating access transporter, the catalytic cycle consists of substrate binding to an outward-facing conformation, transition to an occluded state, transition to an inward-facing conformation, substrate release, and reset. The turnover number $k_{\\text{cat}}$ (and thus $V_{\\max} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{tot}}$) is controlled by the slowest elementary step, which commonly includes large conformational changes that interconvert outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing states.\n\n2) Structural role of G284: The universally conserved glycine at position 284 in TM7 is proposed to be a molecular hinge that enables the rocking motion of TM7. Glycine’s lack of a side chain (beyond hydrogen) minimizes steric hindrance and allows a broader range of backbone dihedral angles, facilitating helix kinking and rocking that are required to traverse outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing conformations. This conservation implies strong functional selection for local flexibility at this position.\n\n3) Effect of G to W substitution at the hinge: Replacing glycine with tryptophan introduces a large, bulky, and rigid side chain at the hinge. This has two direct consequences:\n- It reduces local backbone conformational flexibility by introducing steric bulk, thereby disfavoring the bending/kinking required for the hinge motion.\n- It increases the likelihood of steric clashes with neighboring helices/lipids and stabilizes one conformational basin over others, raising the energetic barrier between conformations.\n\n4) Kinetic consequence of an increased conformational barrier: The rate of a conformational transition can be expressed using transition state theory as\n$$\nk_{\\text{conf}} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conf}}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conf}}$ is the free-energy barrier for the conformational change. Introducing tryptophan at the hinge increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conf}}$, thereby decreasing $k_{\\text{conf}}$. If this conformational step is rate-limiting, then $k_{\\text{cat}}$ decreases and $V_{\\max}$ decreases; in extreme cases the transporter becomes kinetically trapped (“locked”) in one conformation (e.g., outward-facing) or toggles so slowly as to be severely impaired.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A (increased $V_{\\max}$): Contradicted by increased $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{conf}}$ at the hinge; $k_{\\text{cat}}$ would decrease, not increase.\n- B (locked or severely impaired transitions): Matches the predicted increase in conformational barrier due to loss of hinge flexibility and steric hindrance at TM7.\n- C (loss of specificity to transport larger amino acids): Substrate specificity is primarily determined by the binding site architecture, not a distant hinge; introducing a bulky residue does not enlarge the binding site and is unlikely to broaden specificity to larger substrates.\n- D (dramatic increase in affinity with unchanged $V_{\\max}$): A hinge mutation chiefly affects conformational transitions and thus $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $V_{\\max}}$, not specifically the binding affinity; unchanged $V_{\\max}$ is inconsistent with increased conformational barriers.\n- E (conversion to ATP-dependent active transport): Introducing ATP dependence requires an energy-coupling domain and binding/hydrolysis machinery; a single point mutation at a hinge cannot create ATP-driven transport.\n\nTherefore, the most likely direct consequence is impaired alternating access due to hindered TM7 rocking, leading to functional locking or severe impairment of conformational transitions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2302642"}, {"introduction": "Secondary active transport is a clever cellular strategy to move substances against their concentration gradient without directly using ATP.

This thought experiment challenges you to act as a bioengineer and design a functional artificial organelle from molecular components. By correctly orienting a light-driven proton pump and an ATP synthase within a liposome, you can construct a system that converts light energy into the chemical energy of ATP, demonstrating the core principle of chemiosmotic coupling [@problem_id:2302644].", "problem": "An experiment is designed to create an artificial photosynthetic system. Researchers prepare liposomes, which are small spherical vesicles enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane. The solution used to prepare these liposomes contains a buffer at pH 7.0, along with high concentrations of Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). After formation, the liposomes are placed in an identical external solution, so the internal and external environments are initially the same.\n\nTwo purified membrane proteins are incorporated into the liposome membranes:\n1.  **Bacteriorhodopsin (bR)**: Sourced from *Halobacterium salinarum*, this protein acts as a light-driven proton pump. Upon absorbing light, it pumps protons ($H^+$) from the bacterial cytoplasm to the extracellular space.\n2.  **$F_0F_1$-ATP Synthase**: This enzyme complex uses the energy of a proton gradient to synthesize Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) from ADP and Pi. In its native bacterial cell, protons flow from the extracellular space through the F0 part of the complex into the cytoplasm, driving the F1 part (the \"cytoplasmic domain\") to produce ATP within the cytoplasm.\n\nThe goal of the experiment is to achieve a net synthesis of ATP in the *external solution* when the liposome suspension is illuminated with light. Assuming that the proteins can be inserted into the membrane in one of two orientations, which of the following configurations will successfully produce ATP in the external solution upon illumination?\n\nFor the purposes of this question, \"cytoplasmic domain facing the exterior\" means the part of the protein that normally faces the bacterial cytoplasm is oriented towards the solution outside the liposome. \"Cytoplasmic domain facing the interior\" means this same domain is oriented towards the solution inside the liposome.\n\nA.

Bacteriorhodopsin must be oriented with its cytoplasmic domain facing the interior, and ATP synthase must be oriented with its cytoplasmic domain facing the exterior of the liposome.\n\nE. ATP synthesis will occur upon illumination regardless of the protein orientations, as long as both are present in the membrane.", "solution": "The problem asks for the specific orientation of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and $F_0F_1$-ATP synthase in a liposome membrane that will result in the synthesis of ATP in the external solution upon illumination. Let's analyze the function of each component and the requirements of the system.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the requirements for ATP synthesis.**\nThe goal is to synthesize ATP in the *external solution*. The $F_1$ part of the $F_0F_1$-ATP synthase is the catalytic component that carries out the reaction ADP + Pi -> ATP. Therefore, for ATP to appear in the external solution, the $F_1$ component, which is the \"cytoplasmic domain\" of the synthase, must be facing the external solution.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the proton flow needed for the ATP synthase.**\nIn its native environment, ATP synthase allows protons to flow *down* their concentration gradient, from the high-concentration extracellular space to the low-concentration cytoplasm, driving ATP synthesis in the cytoplasm. In our experimental setup, the $F_1$ subunit is facing the exterior. To drive ATP synthesis, protons must flow through the $F_0$ channel from the region of high concentration to the region of low concentration where the $F_1$ subunit is located. This means protons must flow from the *interior* of the liposome to the *exterior*. This requires establishing a proton gradient where the concentration of $H^+$ is higher inside the liposome than outside (i.e., the internal pH is lower than the external pH).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the function of bacteriorhodopsin (bR).**\nBacteriorhodopsin is a light-activated proton pump. In its native bacterium, it pumps $H^+$ ions from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space. This action creates a proton gradient across the bacterial membrane.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the required orientation of bacteriorhodopsin.**\nTo power the ATP synthase as determined in Step 2, we need to accumulate a high concentration of protons *inside* the liposome. Thus, the bR pumps must move $H^+$ from the external solution into the liposome's interior.\nThe native function of bR is to pump $H^+$ from the cytoplasm to the exterior. To reverse this direction of pumping relative to the membrane (i.e., from outside to inside the vesicle), the protein must be inserted in a \"flipped\" or \"inside-out\" orientation compared to its native state. This means the part of the protein that normally faces the cytoplasm must now face the external solution. Therefore, bacteriorhodopsin must be oriented with its cytoplasmic domain facing the exterior of the liposome.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings and choose the correct option.**\n- From Step 1 & 2: To produce ATP externally, the ATP synthase's cytoplasmic ($F_1$) domain must face the exterior. This orientation allows protons to flow from the liposome's interior to the exterior, driving synthesis.\n- From Step 3 & 4: To create the necessary proton gradient (high $H^+$ inside), bacteriorhodopsin must pump protons into the liposome. This requires its cytoplasmic domain to face the exterior.\n\nConclusion: Both bacteriorhodopsin and ATP synthase must be oriented with their cytoplasmic domains facing the exterior of the liposome.\n\nLet's review the options:\n- A: Incorrect. This would pump protons out and attempt to make ATP inside.\n- B: Incorrect. bR orientation is correct, but ATP synthase orientation is wrong. Protons would be pumped in, but the synthase is oriented to use a proton gradient in the opposite direction and would make ATP inside (if it worked at all).\n- C: Correct. bR pumps protons in, creating a gradient. ATP synthase uses this gradient to make ATP on the outside. Both cytoplasmic domains face the exterior.\n- D: Incorrect. bR would pump protons out, and the synthase would try to use a gradient in that same direction. This would lead to ATP hydrolysis to pump protons in, or no function, but not light-driven synthesis.\n- E: Incorrect. The orientation is critical for establishing and utilizing a directed proton motive force.\n\nTherefore, the only configuration that achieves the desired outcome is the one where both proteins have their cytoplasmic domains facing the external solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2302644"}]}
