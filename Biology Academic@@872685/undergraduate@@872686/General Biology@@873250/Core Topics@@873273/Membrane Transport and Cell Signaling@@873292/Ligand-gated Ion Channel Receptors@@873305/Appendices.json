The direction and physiological effect of ion flow are determined not by the identity of the ion, but by its electrochemical driving force—the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the ion's Nernst potential ($E_{ion}$) [@problem_id:2300394]. By calculating the Nernst potential for chloride in a hypothetical neuron with unusual ion gradients, you will discover that context is everything and that even chloride channels can be excitatory.", "problem": "In neuroscience, the effect of a neurotransmitter is classified as either excitatory or inhibitory based on whether it makes a postsynaptic neuron more or less likely to fire an action potential. This is determined by the flow of ions through ligand-gated channels.\n\nConsider a specialized neuron isolated from a marine crustacean. This neuron has the following properties:\n- Resting membrane potential, $V_m = -70$ mV.\n- Action potential threshold, $V_{th} = -50$ mV.\n- Extracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^{-}]_{out} = 440$ mM.\n- Intracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^{-}]_{in} = 100$ mM, which is maintained by active transport.\n\nA neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on this neuron's postsynaptic membrane, opening a channel that is exclusively permeable to chloride ions ($Cl^{-}$).

For this neuron, we can model the resting state by assuming the membrane is permeable only to potassium ions ($K^+$), so its resting potential is equal to the Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium ($E_K$). The equilibrium potential for sodium ($E_{Na}$) is +60.0 mV, and the equilibrium potential for chloride ($E_{Cl}$) is -65.0 mV.\n\nThe neuron simultaneously receives synaptic inputs that open a large number of both ligand-gated sodium channels and ligand-gated chloride channels. This synaptic event can be modeled by an increase in the membrane's conductance to sodium and chloride. Let the constant resting conductance for potassium be $g_K$. The synaptic activation introduces an additional conductance for sodium, $g_{Na,syn}$, and an additional conductance for chloride, $g_{Cl,syn}$. Assume that the number and type of channels opened results in these two synaptic conductances being equal to each other and also equal to the resting potassium conductance, i.e., $g_{Na,syn} = g_{Cl,syn} = g_K$.
