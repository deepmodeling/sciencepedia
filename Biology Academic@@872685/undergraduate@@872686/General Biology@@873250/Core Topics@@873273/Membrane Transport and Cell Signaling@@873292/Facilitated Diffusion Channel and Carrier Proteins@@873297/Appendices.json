This practice challenges you to act like an experimental biologist and deduce the identity of two unknown proteins based solely on their transport kinetics. By analyzing the relationship between transport rate and solute concentration, you will learn to distinguish the non-saturating, high-capacity profile of a channel from the saturable, lower-capacity profile of a carrier, which are hallmark characteristics used to classify transport proteins [@problem_id:2315820].", "problem": "An experimental biologist is investigating the transport of a specific amino acid, Tryptophan, across the plasma membrane of a newly discovered eukaryotic cell. The transport is known to be a form of facilitated diffusion, occurring at rates significantly faster than simple diffusion across a lipid bilayer. The biologist isolates and reconstitutes two different integral membrane proteins, Protein X and Protein Y, into artificial lipid vesicles and measures the initial rate of Tryptophan uptake as a function of external Tryptophan concentration.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n- For vesicles containing **Protein X**, the transport rate is observed to be directly proportional to the Tryptophan concentration over the entire tested range from 0 to 100 mM. At the highest concentration, the measured transport rate is approximately $10^7$ molecules per second per protein.\n- For vesicles containing **Protein Y**, the transport rate increases with Tryptophan concentration at low concentrations, but the rate of increase progressively slows. At concentrations above 25 mM, the transport rate effectively reaches a plateau, showing no significant further increase. The maximum rate achieved at this plateau is approximately $10^3$ molecules per second per protein.\n\nBased on these distinct kinetic profiles, what are the most likely identities of Protein X and Protein Y?\n\nA. Protein X is a carrier protein, and Protein Y is a channel protein.\n\nB. Protein X is a channel protein, and Protein Y is a carrier protein.\n\nC. Both Protein X and Protein Y are channel proteins.\n\nD. Both Protein X and Protein Y are carrier proteins.\n\nE. Protein X uses primary active transport, and Protein Y is a carrier protein.", "solution": "We identify the transport mechanism types by their kinetic signatures and turnover capacities.\n\nFirst, facilitated diffusion via channels provides a continuous aqueous pathway. The net flux for a channel in the initial-rate regime with negligible internal substrate is proportional to the external concentration, following a linear relation consistent with Fick-type behavior:\n$$\nv \\propto \\Delta C \\approx [\\text{Trp}]_{\\text{out}}.\n$$\nChannels also exhibit very high turnover numbers per protein, typically on the order of $10^{7}$ to $10^{8}$ molecules per second per channel, because multiple solute molecules pass through the open pore in rapid succession without requiring large conformational changes per transport event.\n\nSecond, facilitated diffusion via carriers (transporters) proceeds through alternating-access conformational changes, producing saturable kinetics described by a Michaelis–Menten form:\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}[\\text{Trp}]_{\\text{out}}}{K_{M} + [\\text{Trp}]_{\\text{out}}}.\n$$\nThis yields initial proportionality at low concentrations and a plateau at high concentrations when $[\\text{Trp}]_{\\text{out}} \\gg K_{M}$, where $v \\to V_{\\max}$. Carrier turnover numbers are typically much lower than channels, often about $10^{1}$ to $10^{3}$ molecules per second per transporter because each transport cycle requires a full conformational change.\n\nNow match to the observations:\n\n- Protein X shows a rate directly proportional to concentration from $0$ to the highest tested concentration, with no sign of saturation, and an observed rate near $10^{7}$ molecules per second per protein at the high end. This linearity across the tested range and the large turnover are hallmark features of a channel.\n\n- Protein Y shows a rate that increases at low substrate but approaches a plateau at higher concentrations (above a characteristic concentration), with a maximum near $10^{3}$ molecules per second per protein. The saturable kinetics and low turnover are characteristic of a carrier following Michaelis–Menten behavior.\n\nTherefore, Protein X is most consistent with a channel protein, and Protein Y with a carrier protein.\n\nEliminations:\n- Option A reverses the identities, contradicting both the kinetic forms and turnover magnitudes.\n- Option C is incompatible because Protein Y displays saturation typical of carriers.\n- Option D is incompatible because Protein X shows no saturation and has a channel-like turnover rate.\n- Option E is incompatible with the stated facilitated diffusion mechanism and also mismatches Protein X’s kinetics; primary active transport would be saturable and energy-coupled, not simply proportional across the range.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that Protein X is a channel protein and Protein Y is a carrier protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2315820"}, {"introduction": "The kinetic parameters of a carrier protein, $V_{max}$ and $K_M$, are not merely abstract constants; they represent evolutionary adaptations to a cell's specific physiological environment. This exercise presents a compelling scenario comparing two transporters adapted for either nutrient-rich or nutrient-scarce conditions.

Neither transporter will function effectively, as the substrate concentration is below the $K_M$ value for both.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must determine which transporter, A or B, has a higher initial rate of transport ($V_0$) when the substrate (glucorin) concentration, $[S]$, is 0.50 mM. The initial velocity of a carrier protein-mediated transport process is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n\n$$V_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\n\nHere, $V_{max}$ is the maximal velocity, $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant (the substrate concentration at which the transport rate is half of $V_{max}$), and $[S]$ is the substrate concentration. A lower $K_M$ value implies a higher affinity of the transporter for its substrate.\n\nLet's calculate the initial transport velocity for each transporter under the specified conditions.\n\n**For Transporter A:**\nThe given parameters are:\n$V_{max, A} = 800$ pmol/s\n$K_{M, A} = 12$ mM\n$[S] = 0.50$ mM\n\nPlugging these values into the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$V_{0, A} = \\frac{(800 \\text{ pmol/s}) \\times (0.50 \\text{ mM})}{12 \\text{ mM} + 0.50 \\text{ mM}}$$\n$$V_{0, A} = \\frac{400}{12.5} \\text{ pmol/s}$$\n$$V_{0, A} = 32 \\text{ pmol/s}$$\n\n**For Transporter B:**\nThe given parameters are:\n$V_{max, B} = 150$ pmol/s\n$K_{M, B} = 0.40$ mM\n$[S] = 0.50$ mM\n\nPlugging these values into the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$V_{0, B} = \\frac{(150 \\text{ pmol/s}) \\times (0.50 \\text{ mM})}{0.40 \\text{ mM} + 0.50 \\text{ mM}}$$\n$$V_{0, B} = \\frac{75}{0.90} \\text{ pmol/s}$$\n$$V_{0, B} = 83.33... \\text{ pmol/s}$$\n\n**Comparison and Analysis:**\nBy comparing the initial velocities, we find that $V_{0, B} (83.3 \\text{ pmol/s}) > V_{0, A} (32 \\text{ pmol/s})$. Therefore, Transporter B is significantly more effective at importing glucorin under these low-concentration conditions.\n\nThis outcome highlights a key principle of enzyme/transporter kinetics. When the substrate concentration $[S]$ is much lower than the Michaelis constant $K_M$ (as is the case for Transporter A, where $0.50 \\text{ mM} \\ll 12 \\text{ mM}$), the Michaelis-Menten equation can be approximated as:\n$$V_0 \\approx \\frac{V_{max}}{K_M} [S]$$\nThe ratio $V_{max}/K_M$ is known as the catalytic efficiency or specificity constant. This ratio determines the effectiveness of a transporter at low substrate concentrations. Let's calculate this for both transporters.\n\nCatalytic efficiency for Transporter A:\n$$\\frac{V_{max, A}}{K_{M, A}} = \\frac{800 \\text{ pmol/s}}{12 \\text{ mM}} \\approx 66.7 \\text{ (pmol/s)/mM}$$\n\nCatalytic efficiency for Transporter B:\n$$\\frac{V_{max, B}}{K_{M, B}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ pmol/s}}{0.40 \\text{ mM}} = 375 \\text{ (pmol/s)/mM}$$\n\nTransporter B has a much higher catalytic efficiency than Transporter A. This confirms that Transporter B is better adapted for scavenging substrate from a low-concentration environment. Its high affinity (very low $K_M$) more than compensates for its lower maximal velocity ($V_{max}$).\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. Incorrect. While Transporter A has a higher $V_{max}$, this high capacity is only realized at very high (saturating) substrate concentrations. At low $[S]$, it performs poorly.\nB. Correct. The calculations show that Transporter B is more effective. The reason is its high affinity (low $K_M$), which is crucial for efficient binding and transport when substrate molecules are scarce.\nC. Incorrect. The calculated transport rates are clearly different ($83.3$ vs $32$ pmol/s).\nD. Incorrect. This statement claims Transporter A is more effective because its catalytic efficiency ($V_{max}/K_M$) is greater, but our calculation shows the opposite: the efficiency of B (375) is much greater than that of A (66.7).\nE. Incorrect. Both transporters function, albeit at rates below their $V_{max}$.
