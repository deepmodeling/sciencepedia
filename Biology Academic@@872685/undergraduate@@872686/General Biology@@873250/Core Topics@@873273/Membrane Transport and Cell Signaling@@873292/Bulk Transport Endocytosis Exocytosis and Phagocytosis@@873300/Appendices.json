This exercise provides a quantitative look at why receptor-mediated endocytosis is vastly more efficient than simple pinocytosis, or \"cell drinking,\" especially when a cell needs to acquire a specific molecule that is scarce in its environment. By modeling a single vesicle-forming event, you will calculate a \"concentration factor\" that vividly illustrates the power of molecular specificity in bulk transport [@problem_id:2282700].", "problem": "A specific type of fibroblast in a culture medium requires the uptake of a growth factor to stimulate mitosis. The extracellular concentration of this growth factor is extremely low. The cell can internalize the growth factor through two primary mechanisms: non-specific pinocytosis (\"cell drinking\") and highly specific Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis (RME). To understand the dramatic difference in efficiency between these two processes, we will model a single endocytic event.\n\nAssume that both pinocytosis and RME produce spherical vesicles of the same diameter. The key difference is that in RME, the growth factor molecules first bind to receptors on the cell surface, which then cluster in a pit that invaginates to form the vesicle. This clustering mechanism effectively concentrates the growth factor from the extracellular medium.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- The extracellular concentration of the growth factor, $C_{out} = 2.50 \\times 10^{-11}$ M (moles per liter).\n- The uniform density of specific growth factor receptors on the fibroblast's plasma membrane, $\\sigma_R = 2000$ receptors/$\\mu\\text{m}^2$.\n- The diameter of a newly formed endocytic vesicle, $d = 120$ nm.\n- Avogadro's constant, $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$.\n\nFor your model, make the following simplifying assumptions:\n1. Endocytic vesicles are perfect spheres.\n2. For RME, the high affinity of the receptors ensures that all receptors located on the surface of the forming vesicle are bound to a growth factor molecule.\n3. The total number of molecules internalized by RME is the sum of those bound to receptors and those dissolved in the vesicle's fluid volume.\n\nCalculate the concentration factor, which is defined as the ratio of the total number of growth factor molecules internalized in a single RME vesicle to the number of molecules internalized in a single pinocytic vesicle of the same size.

By working through the logical consequences of this single molecular failure, you will deepen your understanding of how pH-dependent binding and release events govern the intricate choreography of receptor recycling and ligand delivery [@problem_id:2282689].", "problem": "The cellular uptake of iron is a critical process, primarily mediated by the receptor-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex. In the extracellular fluid, which has a neutral pH of approximately 7.4, an iron-transporting protein called ferrotransferrin (Fe-Tf), which is transferrin bound to two Fe³⁺ ions, binds with high affinity to the Transferrin Receptor (TfR) on the cell surface. This Fe-Tf-TfR complex is then internalized into the cell within an early endosome. In a normal cell, the endosome matures and its internal environment is acidified to a pH of approximately 5.5 by vacuolar-type H⁺-ATPase (V-ATPase) pumps. This acidic environment causes the Fe³⁺ ions to dissociate from transferrin. The resulting iron-free transferrin, known as apotransferrin (apo-Tf), remains bound to the TfR at this acidic pH. The entire apo-Tf-TfR complex is then recycled back to the plasma membrane. Upon exposure to the neutral pH of the extracellular fluid, apo-Tf loses its affinity for the TfR and is released, leaving the receptor free to bind another molecule of Fe-Tf.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cell line with a genetic mutation that results in a complete loss of function of the V-ATPase pumps. In these cells, the pH of the endosomal lumen fails to decrease and remains at a neutral pH of ~7.4.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this mutation on the transferrin cycle?\n\nA. Ferrotransferrin will be unable to bind to the transferrin receptor on the cell surface, preventing endocytosis.\n\nB. The transferrin receptor and its bound ligand will be missorted and prematurely degraded in the lysosome.\n\nC. Apotransferrin will become trapped on the transferrin receptor within the endosome, preventing receptor recycling.\n\nD. The transferrin receptor will recycle to the cell surface, but will remain occupied by ferrotransferrin, thus failing to deliver iron to the cell.\n\nE. Iron will be successfully released into the endosome, but the apotransferrin-transferrin receptor complex will fail to recycle to the cell surface.", "solution": "Principles:\n- Transferrin-mediated iron uptake relies on pH-dependent affinity changes: at extracellular $pH \\approx 7.4$, ferrotransferrin (Fe-Tf) binds the transferrin receptor (TfR) with high affinity; at endosomal $pH \\approx 5.5$, Fe^{3+} is released from transferrin, and apotransferrin (apo-Tf) remains bound to TfR; upon return to $pH \\approx 7.4$, apo-Tf loses affinity and dissociates.\n- V-ATPase acidifies endosomes; its loss prevents the $pH$ drop required for iron release from transferrin.\n- TfR primarily follows a constitutive recycling itinerary; pH governs ligand binding/release, not the basic recycling route.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1) In the mutant cell, V-ATPase is nonfunctional; therefore, the endosomal lumen fails to acidify and remains at $pH \\approx 7.4$.\n2) At $pH \\approx 7.4$, Fe-Tf maintains high affinity for TfR, and transferrin does not undergo the conformational change needed to release Fe^{3+}. Thus, iron is not released in the endosome.\n3) Because Fe^{3+} is not released, apo-Tf is not generated in the endosome. Therefore, the state in which apo-Tf remains bound to TfR at low pH cannot occur.\n4) The TfR-ligand complex continues along its normal recycling pathway back to the plasma membrane, since recycling is not strictly dependent on acidification for trafficking.\n5) Upon return to the cell surface at $pH \\approx 7.4$, Fe-Tf still has high affinity for TfR and thus remains bound, preventing both iron delivery to the cytosol and receptor availability for new Fe-Tf uptake.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is false: Fe-Tf binds TfR at $pH \\approx 7.4$.\n- B is unlikely: loss of acidification does not by itself induce missorting to lysosomes for degradation of TfR.\n- C is false: apo-Tf is not formed without acidification; moreover, recycling is not prevented.\n- D is correct: TfR recycles but remains occupied by Fe-Tf, failing to deliver iron.\n- E is false: iron is not released without acidification, and the complex still recycles.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is as described in D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2282689"}]}
