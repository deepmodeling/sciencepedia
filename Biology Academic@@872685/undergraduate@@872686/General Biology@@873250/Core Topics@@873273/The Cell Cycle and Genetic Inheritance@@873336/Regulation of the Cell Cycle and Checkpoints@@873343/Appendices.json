{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Much of our understanding of the cell cycle comes from clever experiments that reveal how different stages are controlled. This first practice is a thought experiment based on landmark cell fusion studies. By imagining the fusion of a cell in the G1 phase with one in the S phase, you can deduce the nature of the signals that govern DNA replication, illustrating the concept of dominant, diffusible factors that actively drive a cell into the next phase. [@problem_id:2312612]", "problem": "In a series of landmark cell fusion experiments, researchers investigated the cytoplasmic signals that regulate the progression of the cell cycle. Consider a population of actively dividing mammalian somatic cells in culture. The cell cycle for these cells consists of four distinct phases: G1 (first gap), S (synthesis), G2 (second gap), and M (mitosis). Using techniques for inducing cell fusion, a single cell in the G1 phase is fused with a single cell in the S phase, creating a single, larger cell with two distinct nuclei in a shared cytoplasm.\n\nBased on the known principles of cell cycle control, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate fate of the nucleus that was originally in the G1 phase?\n\nA. The G1 nucleus will immediately enter S phase and begin DNA replication.\n\nB. The G1 nucleus will remain in the G1 phase until the S-phase nucleus has completed DNA replication.\n\nC. The G1 nucleus will skip the S and G2 phases and proceed directly into mitosis, leading to premature chromosome condensation.\n\nD. The S-phase nucleus will halt its DNA replication and revert to the G1 phase to synchronize with the G1 nucleus.\n\nE. Both nuclei will be arrested in their respective phases, and the fused cell will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) due to conflicting regulatory signals.", "solution": "The solution to this problem lies in understanding that the cell cycle is driven by diffusible regulatory proteins in the cytoplasm. The presence or absence of these factors at different stages dictates the transitions between phases.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key regulatory state of the fused cells.\nThe problem describes the fusion of a G1-phase cell and an S-phase cell. The G1-phase cell is prepared for DNA replication but has not yet received the signal to begin. The S-phase cell is actively replicating its DNA. This active state is maintained by specific cytoplasmic factors.\n\nStep 2: Characterize the cytoplasmic environment of the S-phase cell.\nA cell in S phase has a high concentration of S-phase promoting factors. These are primarily complexes of specific cyclins (S-cyclins) and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs). These S-Cdk complexes are active and are responsible for initiating and maintaining DNA synthesis by phosphorylating various proteins, including those that form the pre-replicative complexes at origins of replication.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the consequences of cell fusion.\nWhen the G1 cell and the S cell fuse, their cytoplasms mix. The S-phase promoting factors (the active S-Cdk complexes) from the S-phase cell's cytoplasm become distributed throughout the shared cytoplasm of the newly formed hybrid cell. These factors can then diffuse into the nucleus that came from the G1 cell.\n\nStep 4: Determine the effect of S-phase factors on the G1 nucleus.\nThe nucleus from the G1 cell has already passed the restriction point (or START point), meaning it is committed to division and has assembled pre-replicative complexes on its DNA. It is essentially \"licensed\" for replication and is waiting for the go-ahead signal. The active S-Cdk complexes from the S-phase cytoplasm provide this signal. They phosphorylate the necessary targets within the G1 nucleus, activating the origins of replication and initiating DNA synthesis. Therefore, the G1 nucleus is immediately driven into S phase.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding.\n- Option A: \"The G1 nucleus will immediately enter S phase and begin DNA replication.\" This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The diffusible S-phase promoting factors in the shared cytoplasm act on the G1 nucleus, inducing it to enter S phase. This is the correct outcome.\n\n- Option B: \"The G1 nucleus will remain in the G1 phase until the S-phase nucleus has completed DNA replication.\" This is incorrect. There is no known mechanism that would inhibit the active S-phase factors from acting on the receptive G1 nucleus. The signals are \"dominant\" and act immediately.\n\n- Option C: \"The G1 nucleus will skip the S and G2 phases and proceed directly into mitosis...\" This describes what happens when an interphase cell (G1, S, or G2) is fused with a cell in M-phase. The M-phase cell contains active M-phase Promoting Factor (MPF), which causes premature chromosome condensation. The S-phase cell does not have active MPF, so this outcome will not occur.\n\n- Option D: \"The S-phase nucleus will halt its DNA replication and revert to the G1 phase...\" This is incorrect. The cell cycle is a tightly regulated and unidirectional process. Active S-phase factors cannot be \"overridden\" by the G1 state, and an S-phase nucleus cannot revert to G1.\n\n- Option E: \"Both nuclei will be arrested... and the fused cell will undergo apoptosis...\" While severe cellular stress can trigger apoptosis, this specific experimental fusion is a classic demonstration of a fundamental regulatory mechanism. The signals are not \"conflicting\" in a way that causes cell death; rather, the S-phase signals are dominant and induce a state change in the G1 nucleus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2312612"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of dominant cytoplasmic signals, this next scenario explores what happens when a G1 cell is fused with a cell in the midst of mitosis (M-phase). This classic thought experiment reveals the powerful and overriding nature of the M-phase Promoting Factor ($MPF$). You will predict the dramatic structural changes forced upon an unprepared G1 nucleus, a phenomenon known as premature chromosome condensation, which provides striking visual evidence for the activity of mitotic regulators. [@problem_id:1517214]", "problem": "An experimental biologist is studying the regulation of the cell cycle in a line of mammalian somatic cells. These cells are from a diploid organism. A single cell in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is selected. This G1 cell has its full complement of unreplicated chromosomes and a stable, intact nuclear envelope. Using a chemical fusogen, the biologist successfully fuses this G1 cell with another cell from the same line that is arrested in M-phase (specifically, metaphase).\n\nAssume the fusion is instantaneous and results in a single, larger cell containing the cytoplasm from both original cells and the two distinct nuclei (one from the G1 cell and one from the M-phase cell). Which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate fate of the nucleus from the original G1 cell?\n\nA. The nucleus will immediately enter S-phase, replicate its DNA, and then proceed into mitosis.\n\nB. The nucleus will remain in G1 phase, its nuclear envelope intact, until the M-phase portion of the hybrid cell completes mitosis and cytokinesis.\n\nC. The nuclear envelope will break down, and its chromatin will undergo premature condensation, forming elongated, single-chromatid chromosomes.\n\nD. The nucleus will proceed through a normal mitotic division, condensing its chromatin into the typical X-shaped chromosomes composed of two sister chromatids.\n\nE. The conflicting cell cycle signals will trigger an apoptotic cascade, leading to the selective degradation and fragmentation of the G1 nucleus.", "solution": "The problem asks for the immediate fate of a G1-phase nucleus when placed in an M-phase cytoplasm through cell fusion. To solve this, we must consider the dominant regulatory factors present in the cytoplasm of each cell.\n\nThe cell cycle is driven by protein complexes called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory partners, cyclins. The activity of specific cyclin/CDK complexes dictates the events of each phase.\n\nThe M-phase cell is characterized by a high concentration of active M-phase Promoting Factor (MPF). MPF is a complex formed by an M-phase cyclin (typically Cyclin B) and a CDK (typically CDK1). High MPF activity is the master trigger for entry into mitosis. The key functions of active MPF include:\n1.  Phosphorylating nuclear lamins, which are proteins that provide structural support to the nuclear envelope. This phosphorylation leads to the disassembly of the nuclear lamina and the breakdown of the nuclear envelope.\n2.  Phosphorylating and activating other proteins, such as the condensin complex, which is responsible for the large-scale compaction of chromatin into visible chromosomes.\n\nThe G1-phase cell has low MPF activity. Its cytoplasm contains factors necessary for G1 progression but lacks the drivers for S-phase or M-phase. The nucleus of the G1 cell contains decondensed chromatin, and its DNA is unreplicated. Each chromosome consists of a single DNA double helix (a single chromatid).\n\nWhen the G1 cell is fused with the M-phase cell, the cytoplasm of the resulting hybrid cell becomes a mixture of the contents of both. However, the high concentration of active MPF from the M-phase cell is dominant. These diffusible MPF molecules will enter the G1 nucleus and act on their substrates within that nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the following events will occur in the G1 nucleus:\n1.  The active MPF from the M-phase cytoplasm will phosphorylate the nuclear lamins of the G1 nucleus, causing its nuclear envelope to break down, just as it would in a normal prophase.\n2.  The active MPF will also activate condensin complexes associated with the G1 chromatin. This will cause the chromatin to undergo condensation.\n\nCrucially, the G1 nucleus has not passed through S-phase, so its DNA is unreplicated. When this unreplicated chromatin is forced to condense, the resulting structures are not the familiar X-shaped chromosomes (which consist of two identical sister chromatids). Instead, the chromosomes will appear as single, thin, elongated threads. This phenomenon is known as Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. The nucleus will immediately enter S-phase. This is incorrect. High M-phase CDK activity actually inhibits the formation of the pre-replication complexes required to initiate DNA synthesis, thus preventing entry into S-phase.\nB. The nucleus will remain in G1 phase. This is incorrect because the mitotic signals (MPF) from the M-phase cytoplasm are dominant and will act on the G1 nucleus.\nC. The nuclear envelope will break down, and its chromatin will undergo premature condensation, forming elongated, single-chromatid chromosomes. This is the correct description of the events. The dominant MPF induces both nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation on the unreplicated G1 chromatin.\nD. The nucleus will proceed through a normal mitotic division, condensing its chromatin into X-shaped chromosomes. This is incorrect because the formation of X-shaped chromosomes (composed of two sister chromatids) requires DNA replication (S-phase), which has not occurred in the G1 nucleus.\nE. The conflicting signals will trigger apoptosis. While severe cell cycle checkpoint failure can lead to apoptosis, the primary, direct, and immediate effect of exposing a G1 nucleus to M-phase cytoplasm is forced entry into a mitosis-like state, not cell death.\n\nThus, the G1 nucleus will undergo premature chromosome condensation, driven by the dominant MPF activity from the M-phase cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1517214"}, {"introduction": "Beyond cell fusions, much of the cell cycle machinery was discovered through genetic screens in model organisms like yeast. This final practice places you in the role of a geneticist analyzing a temperature-sensitive `cdc` (cell division cycle) mutant. By carefully interpreting multiple pieces of evidence—from cell morphology and DNA content to spindle structure—you can pinpoint the precise step where the cell cycle fails, and in doing so, deduce the normal function of the mutated gene. [@problem_id:2312623]", "problem": "A geneticist is studying cell cycle control in the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. They isolate a new temperature-sensitive mutant, designated `cdcY`, where `cdc` stands for cell division cycle. This type of mutant can grow and divide normally at a permissive temperature of 23°C but shows a defect when shifted to a restrictive temperature of 36°C.\n\nWhen a culture of `cdcY` cells, synchronized in the G1 phase, is shifted to the restrictive temperature of 36°C, the cells are observed to undergo a single, terminal cell cycle arrest. Microscopic examination and flow cytometry of the arrested cells reveal the following uniform characteristics:\n1.  All cells have a single, large bud, indicating they have progressed beyond the G1/S transition.\n2.  DNA content analysis shows that all cells have completed DNA replication, possessing a 2C DNA content (where a G1 cell has 1C).\n3.  Staining of the nucleus and microtubules shows that in every arrested cell, a short, intact mitotic spindle has formed within the nucleus, and the nucleus has migrated to the junction (the \"neck\") between the mother cell and the bud.\n4.  The sister chromatids are condensed and appear to be properly attached to the short spindle, but they have not separated, and the spindle has not elongated.\n\nBased on these specific observations of the arrest phenotype, which of the following describes the most likely normal function of the protein encoded by the `cdcY` gene?\n\nA. It is a helicase required to unwind DNA at the origin of replication during S phase.\n\nB. It is a component of the regulatory machinery that controls the G1 to S phase transition, often called \"Start\" in yeast.\n\nC. It is a component of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which targets key proteins for degradation to initiate anaphase.\n\nD. It is a motor protein responsible for pulling the daughter nucleus into the bud after anaphase is complete.\n\nE. It is a component of the contractile ring required for cytokinesis, the physical separation of the mother and daughter cells.", "solution": "We interpret the temperature-sensitive phenotype by locating the precise point in the cell cycle at which the cells arrest when shifted to the restrictive temperature. In a classic budding yeast cdc mutant, cells complete steps that do not require the mutated function but arrest at the specific step that does require it, producing a uniform terminal phenotype after a single cell cycle.\n\nFirst, the observation that every cell bears a single, large bud indicates that the cells have passed the G1/S control point known as Start and initiated bud emergence. Therefore, the mutant does not affect the regulatory machinery that controls the G1 to S phase transition; this excludes option B.\n\nSecond, DNA content analysis shows a uniform 2C DNA content, meaning DNA replication has been completed. Therefore, the mutant is not defective in initiation or progression of S phase. This excludes a replication helicase defect; thus option A is inconsistent.\n\nThird, staining reveals a short, intact mitotic spindle within the nucleus and the nucleus positioned at the mother–bud neck. In budding yeast, a short intranuclear spindle indicates metaphase, when sister chromatids are bi-oriented and the spindle is not yet elongated.\n\nFourth, sister chromatids appear condensed and attached to the short spindle, but they have not separated, and the spindle has not elongated. This places the arrest at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Entry into anaphase requires proteolysis of securin and reduction of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Mechanistically, the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), activated by Cdc20, ubiquitinates securin, leading to its proteasomal degradation. Loss of securin activates separase, which cleaves cohesin to allow sister chromatid separation. APC/C also promotes the degradation of specific mitotic cyclins, lowering cyclin-dependent kinase activity to permit spindle elongation during anaphase B and subsequent mitotic progression. If APC/C function is impaired, securin is not degraded, separase remains inactive, cohesin remains intact, sister chromatids cannot separate, and the spindle fails to elongate. This precisely matches the observed phenotype: bi-oriented sister chromatids on a short metaphase spindle, no chromatid separation, and no spindle elongation.\n\nOptions D and E describe functions occurring after anaphase initiation: pulling the daughter nucleus into the bud occurs after chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis occurs after nuclear division. Because anaphase has not begun in the arrested cells, defects in these late processes cannot explain the observed metaphase arrest.\n\nTherefore, the most likely normal function of the protein encoded by the cdcY gene is as a component of the APC/C that triggers anaphase by targeting key substrates for degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2312623"}]}
