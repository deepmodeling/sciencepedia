This exercise uses a classic genetic approach to understand this sequence by asking you to predict the outcome when a critical component, the FtsZ protein, is disabled. By considering a scenario where the cell's \"drawstring\" fails to tighten while all other growth processes continue, you can deduce the resulting cellular morphology and appreciate how cytokinesis is uncoupled from, yet essential to, the completion of the cell cycle. [@problem_id:2281329]", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a novel, temperature-sensitive mutant strain of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. This strain possesses a mutation in the *ftsZ* gene. The protein product of this gene, FtsZ, is essential for cell division. At a permissive temperature of 30°C, the FtsZ protein is functional, and the bacteria divide normally via binary fission. However, at a restrictive temperature of 42°C, the FtsZ protein is rendered completely non-functional.\n\nThe microbiologist first grows a culture of these mutant bacteria in a nutrient-rich broth at the permissive temperature of 30°C. Once the culture reaches a healthy, exponential phase of growth, it is abruptly shifted to the restrictive temperature of 42°C. The experimental setup ensures that the bacteria have ample nutrients to continue growth and that the cells are able to successfully complete multiple rounds of DNA replication.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected primary observation of the bacterial cells after they have been incubated for several hours at the restrictive temperature of 42°C?\n\nA. The bacteria will form long, filamentous cells, each containing multiple, fully replicated chromosomes distributed along its length.\n\nB. The bacteria will be unable to replicate their DNA due to the temperature stress, leading to cell cycle arrest and a population of normal-sized, non-dividing cells.\n\nC. The bacteria will divide asymmetrically, with the septum forming near one of the cell poles, resulting in the production of one normal-sized cell and one small, anucleated minicell.\n\nD. The bacteria will immediately lyse because the non-functional FtsZ protein destabilizes the integrity of the cell wall, making the cells susceptible to osmotic pressure.\n\nE. The bacteria will differentiate into endospores, a dormant and resistant state, to survive the unfavorable high-temperature condition.", "solution": "The problem asks for the cellular fate of a specific *E. coli* mutant at a restrictive temperature. Let's break down the biological processes involved.\n\nFirst, we must understand the normal process of binary fission in bacteria like *E. coli*. This process involves three main coordinated events: (1) cell growth and elongation, (2) replication of the circular chromosome and segregation of the copies to opposite ends of the cell, and (3) cytokinesis, which is the physical division of the cell into two.\n\nSecond, we need to identify the specific role of the FtsZ protein. FtsZ is a crucial protein in bacterial cytokinesis. It polymerizes at the future division site in the middle of the cell to form a structure called the Z-ring. This Z-ring acts as a scaffold, recruiting other proteins to form a complex known as the divisome. The divisome then synthesizes a new cell wall and membrane, called the septum, which grows inward and eventually pinches the cell into two identical daughter cells.\n\nThird, we must analyze the effect of the mutation described in the problem. The *ftsZ* gene is mutated such that its protein product is non-functional at 42°C. This means that at the restrictive temperature, the FtsZ protein cannot form the Z-ring. Without the Z-ring, the entire process of cytokinesis is blocked; the cell cannot form a septum and cannot divide.\n\nFourth, we consider the other cellular processes. The problem explicitly states that the bacteria continue to grow (increase in mass and size) and successfully replicate their DNA. This indicates that cell elongation and chromosome replication are uncoupled from cell division.\n\nSynthesizing these points, a cell that cannot divide but continues to grow will simply get longer and longer, forming a filament. Concurrently, as it continues to replicate its DNA without dividing, this single, elongated cell will accumulate multiple copies of its chromosome. These replicated chromosomes, or nucleoids, will be distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the filamentous cell.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. The bacteria will form long, filamentous cells, each containing multiple, fully replicated chromosomes distributed along its length. This description perfectly matches our analysis. The failure of cytokinesis (due to non-functional FtsZ) combined with continued growth and DNA replication leads to the formation of long, multinucleated filaments.\n\nB. The bacteria will be unable to replicate their DNA... This option is incorrect because the problem explicitly states that the cells \"are able to successfully complete multiple rounds of DNA replication.\"\n\nC. The bacteria will divide asymmetrically... This phenotype, characterized by the formation of small, anucleated \"minicells,\" is typically caused by mutations in the *min* gene system (*minC*, *minD*, *minE*), which regulates the *placement* of the Z-ring, not its formation. Since FtsZ is required to form the Z-ring in the first place, no septum (symmetric or asymmetric) can be formed at all.\n\nD. The bacteria will immediately lyse... While very long filaments can eventually become fragile and lyse, this is not the immediate or primary phenotype. The defining characteristic is the change in morphology to a filament due to continued growth in the absence of division. The word \"immediately\" makes this option incorrect.\n\nE. The bacteria will differentiate into endospores... This is factually incorrect. *Escherichia coli* is a species of bacterium that does not have the genetic capacity to form endospores. This survival mechanism is characteristic of other genera, such as *Bacillus* and *Clostridium*.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the outcome is the formation of long, multinucleated filaments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2281329"}, {"introduction": "For binary fission to produce two viable offspring, the division event must not only occur but must occur at the right place: the cell's midpoint.

Let $x$ denote position along the long axis. Define two local inhibitory fields: $I_{\\text{Min}}(x)$ due to the Min system and $I_{\\text{NO}}(x)$ due to nucleoid occlusion. The local propensity for FtsZ-ring assembly, $P_{\\text{ring}}(x)$, decreases with either inhibitor:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_{\\text{ring}}(x)}{\\partial I_{\\text{Min}}(x)}<0,\\quad \\frac{\\partial P_{\\text{ring}}(x)}{\\partial I_{\\text{NO}}(x)}<0.\n$$\nIn wild-type cells, time-averaged Min oscillations generate $I_{\\text{Min}}(x)$ that is high at the poles and low at midcell, while $I_{\\text{NO}}(x)$ is high over regions occupied by the nucleoid and low at DNA-free regions (typically the poles and, in late cell cycle, the cleared midcell). Thus, under normal conditions,\n$$\nI_{\\text{Min}}(\\text{pole}) \\gg I_{\\text{Min}}(\\text{mid}),\\quad I_{\\text{NO}}(\\text{nucleoid}) \\gg I_{\\text{NO}}(\\text{DNA-free region}),\n$$\nleading to $P_{\\text{ring}}(\\text{mid}) \\gg P_{\\text{ring}}(\\text{pole})$ once midcell becomes nucleoid-free, thereby favoring correct midcell septation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option by its predicted effect on $I_{\\text{Min}}(x)$, $I_{\\text{NO}}(x)$, and the spatial pattern of $P_{\\text{ring}}(x)$, and compare with the observed phenotype: a significant population of very small, spherical, chromosome-free minicells, which arise from polar septation that pinches off DNA-free polar caps.\n\nA. A mutation that significantly increases the cellular concentration of FtsZ increases $[ \\text{FtsZ} ]$ globally. While this can raise the baseline tendency to polymerize, the position of assembly still follows the spatial inhibitors. Since $I_{\\text{Min}}(\\text{pole})$ remains high and $I_{\\text{NO}}$ blocks assembly over the nucleoid, merely increasing $[ \\text{FtsZ} ]$ does not specifically license polar septation. This does not preferentially generate minicells.\n\nB. A loss-of-function mutation in a core Min gene (e.g., $\\textit{minC}$, $\\textit{minD}$, or $\\textit{minE}$) effectively sets\n$$\nI_{\\text{Min}}(x)\\approx 0\\quad \\text{for all }x.\n$$\nWith Min inhibition absent, Z-rings can form wherever they are not blocked by nucleoid occlusion. Since $I_{\\text{NO}}(x)$ is high over the centrally located nucleoid and low at the DNA-free poles, the maximal $P_{\\text{ring}}(x)$ shifts to the poles:\n$$\nP_{\\text{ring}}(\\text{pole}) \\gg P_{\\text{ring}}(\\text{mid, over nucleoid}).\n$$\nConsequently, polar septation occurs, pinching off small, DNA-free polar caps as minicells and leaving a larger chromosome-containing remnant. This is the classic and most probable cause of a robust minicell phenotype.\n\nC. A loss-of-function mutation in nucleoid occlusion (e.g., $\\textit{slmA}$) reduces $I_{\\text{NO}}(x)$ over the nucleoid, allowing Z-rings to form even above DNA. However, $I_{\\text{Min}}(\\text{pole})$ still disfavors polar rings:\n$$\nI_{\\text{Min}}(\\text{pole}) \\gg I_{\\text{Min}}(\\text{mid}) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad P_{\\text{ring}}(\\text{pole}) \\ll P_{\\text{ring}}(\\text{mid}).\n$$\nThis promotes septation near midcell despite the nucleoid’s presence, potentially severing DNA and generating anucleate progeny of near-normal size, not the characteristic very small, spherical polar minicells.\n\nD. A mutation preventing FtsZ GTP hydrolysis disrupts filament dynamics and constriction. This generally yields division failure and filamentation rather than polar septation. It does not produce a population of minicells.\n\nE. A gain-of-function enhancing MinE activity increases stimulation of MinD ATPase, typically sharpening and accelerating oscillations while maintaining the time-averaged pattern $I_{\\text{Min}}(\\text{pole}) > I_{\\text{Min}}(\\text{mid})$. This tends to reduce, not increase, polar Z-ring assembly. It would not favor minicell formation.\n\nTherefore, only removing the polar inhibition imposed by the Min system both permits polar Z-ring assembly and, combined with nucleoid occlusion that keeps DNA away from the poles, explains the observed abundant, small, anucleate minicells.
