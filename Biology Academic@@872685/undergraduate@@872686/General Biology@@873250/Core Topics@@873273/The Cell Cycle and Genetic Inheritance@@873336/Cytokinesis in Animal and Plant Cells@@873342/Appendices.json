{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The most fundamental difference between animal and plant cytokinesis lies in the cytoskeletal machinery each employs to partition the cell. This exercise challenges you to apply this core concept by predicting the differential effects of a hypothetical drug that targets actin polymerization. By considering how this would impact a human fibroblast versus an onion root cell, you will solidify your understanding of the actin-based contractile ring versus the microtubule-based phragmoplast [@problem_id:2289322].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying the process of cell division. They have developed a new synthetic compound, named Cytofreeze-A, which specifically binds to globular actin (G-actin) monomers and prevents them from polymerizing into filamentous actin (F-actin). To investigate its effects, they prepare two separate synchronized cell cultures that are progressing through the cell cycle together. The first culture consists of human fibroblasts, a type of animal cell. The second culture consists of cells from the meristematic tissue of an onion root tip, a type of plant cell. Just as the cells in both cultures begin telophase, the researchers add a sufficient concentration of Cytofreeze-A to each culture.\n\nBased on the known mechanisms of cytokinesis in these two cell types, which of the following outcomes is the most likely and direct consequence of adding Cytofreeze-A?\n\nA. Cytokinesis will be more directly and profoundly inhibited in the human fibroblasts, as the formation of the actin-based contractile ring required for cleavage furrow formation will be blocked.\n\nB. Cytokinesis will be more directly and profoundly inhibited in the onion root tip cells, as the construction of the microtubule-based phragmoplast is initiated by an actin scaffold.\n\nC. Cytokinesis will be inhibited with equal severity in both cell types, because actin-dependent vesicle transport is the primary mechanism for delivering new membrane and wall components in both processes.\n\nD. Cytokinesis will proceed normally in both cell types, as the primary cytoskeletal element responsible for chromosome separation and cytokinesis is tubulin, not actin.\n\nE. Both cell types will be arrested, but not due to an effect on cytokinesis. Instead, the lack of actin polymerization will cause a catastrophic collapse of the entire cytoskeleton, leading to immediate cell death (apoptosis).", "solution": "Cytofreeze-A binds to globular actin monomers and prevents their polymerization into filamentous actin. Therefore, its direct cellular effect is to inhibit the formation of F-actin structures while leaving microtubules and their dynamics unaffected.\n\nIn animal cytokinesis, exemplified by human fibroblasts, the essential mechanism is the formation and constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring at the cell equator. This ring is composed of F-actin and myosin II and generates the force that drives cleavage furrow ingression. If F-actin polymerization is blocked, the contractile ring cannot assemble, the cleavage furrow fails to form or constrict, and cytokinesis is directly and profoundly inhibited. Thus, fibroblast cytokinesis is highly sensitive to actin polymerization inhibitors.\n\nIn plant cytokinesis, exemplified by onion root tip meristem cells, cytokinesis proceeds via formation of a phragmoplast, a microtubule- and microtubule-associated protein-based structure derived from the midzone of the mitotic spindle. The phragmoplast guides Golgi-derived vesicles to the cell equator, where they fuse to form the cell plate that expands centrifugally to join the parental cell wall. This delivery and assembly are primarily organized by microtubules and kinesin motors. Although actin filaments can contribute to vesicle trafficking and later stages of cell plate expansion and maturation, initial phragmoplast formation and early cell plate assembly are not initiated by an actin scaffold. Therefore, blocking actin polymerization is less directly disruptive to the core plant cytokinesis machinery than it is to animal cytokinesis.\n\nConsequently, the most direct and profound inhibition of cytokinesis upon addition of Cytofreeze-A at telophase will occur in the human fibroblasts due to failure of the actin-based contractile ring. The alternative options are inconsistent with known mechanisms: initiation of the phragmoplast is microtubule-based rather than actin-based, actin-dependent vesicle transport is not the primary driver in both systems, tubulin does not negate the essential role of actin in animal cytokinesis, and immediate global cytoskeletal collapse and apoptosis are not the expected specific outcomes of inhibiting actin polymerization at telophase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2289322"}, {"introduction": "Is the animal cell's contractile ring a static \"purse-string\" that simply tightens, or is it a more complex, dynamic machine? This thought experiment introduces you to a classic cell biology technique, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), to investigate the ring's properties. By predicting the outcome of photobleaching a segment of the fluorescently-tagged ring, you can deduce its dynamic nature and appreciate that it is in constant flux, with subunits continually assembling and disassembling during constriction [@problem_id:1480888].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanism of cytokinesis in an animal cell line that has been genetically engineered to express a version of a non-muscle myosin II subunit fused with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This fusion protein, Myosin-GFP, incorporates into the contractile ring and renders it fluorescent. The biologist observes a cell in an early stage of cytokinesis, with a clearly visible and uniformly bright fluorescent contractile ring forming at the equatorial plate.\n\nUsing a targeted laser, the biologist photobleaches a small, specific segment of the contractile ring, rendering the Myosin-GFP molecules in that segment non-fluorescent and creating a dark gap in the otherwise bright ring. The cell is not damaged and continues to proceed with division.\n\nAssuming that the contractile ring is a highly dynamic structure that undergoes constant disassembly and reassembly by incorporating new subunits from a cytoplasmic pool throughout the process of constriction, which of the following outcomes is expected to be observed in the minutes following the photobleaching event?\n\nA. The fluorescence in the bleached segment will gradually reappear, and the entire ring will continue to constrict.\n\nB. The bleached segment will remain dark, and the two bright, fluorescent portions of the ring will be pulled closer together as if it were a static purse-string, eventually fusing as the dark segment is effectively 'squeezed out'.\n\nC. The bleached segment will remain dark, and the cell will be unable to complete cytokinesis, arresting at its current state.\n\nD. The entire ring, including both the bleached and unbleached portions, will progressively and uniformly lose its fluorescence until it is no longer visible.\n\nE. The bleached segment will move along the circumference of the ring, similar to a bead on a rotating loop, while the ring constricts.", "solution": "The system consists of a contractile ring assembled from Myosin-GFP subunits that are fluorescent when unbleached. A targeted laser photobleaches a local segment, converting the fluorophores in that region to a non-fluorescent state without destroying the protein’s mechanical function, thereby creating a dark gap.\n\nBy assumption, the contractile ring is highly dynamic and undergoes continuous turnover: subunits disassemble from the ring and new subunits from a cytoplasmic pool assemble into it over time. This is the defining condition for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP): if unbleached, fluorescent subunits from a cytoplasmic pool exchange into the bleached region while bleached subunits are lost by turnover, the local fluorescence intensity in the bleached region will increase toward the pre-bleach level.\n\nLogical consequences of the stated assumption:\n- Continuous disassembly and reassembly implies that the identity of the specific molecules at a given position in the ring changes over time due to exchange with the cytoplasmic pool.\n- Since the cytoplasmic pool contains unbleached Myosin-GFP, incorporation will restore fluorescence in the previously bleached segment.\n- Photobleaching does not remove or inhibit the mechanical function of the ring as a whole; it only removes fluorescence in the targeted molecules. Therefore, cytokinesis proceeds, and the ring continues to constrict.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches FRAP expectations under dynamic turnover: fluorescence reappears in the bleached segment due to exchange with unbleached subunits, and constriction continues.\n- B requires a static, non-exchanging “purse-string” where the bleached mark persists and is advected; this contradicts the assumed high turnover and would not show fluorescence recovery.\n- C is inconsistent because photobleaching does not prevent myosin function and exchange replenishes the ring; cytokinesis should proceed.\n- D would require global photobleaching or widespread photodestruction; a localized bleach with ongoing turnover does not cause uniform loss of fluorescence across the entire ring.\n- E suggests persistent advection of a bleached mark; under rapid exchange with a fluorescent pool, the bleached mark dissipates rather than moving as a stable bead.\n\nTherefore, the expected observation is fluorescence recovery in the bleached segment while the ring continues to constrict.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1480888"}, {"introduction": "Scientists use genetics not just to identify genes, but also as a powerful tool to dissect complex biological pathways and determine the order of events. This practice puts you in the role of a molecular geneticist performing an epistasis analysis, a cornerstone of pathway dissection. By predicting the phenotype of a double mutant in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, you will use genetic logic to determine the sequence of steps involved in the final stages of plant cell plate formation and fusion with the parental cell wall [@problem_id:1480889].", "problem": "A plant biologist is studying the final stage of cytokinesis in *Arabidopsis thaliana*: the fusion of the growing cell plate with the parental cell wall. To identify genes involved in this process, they create a transgenic reporter line. This line expresses a fusion protein, PMEI-GFP, under the control of the cyclin B1 promoter (`Pro_CYCB1`). Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor (PMEI) domains target the protein to the expanding edge of the cell plate, and the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) allows for visualization. The `Pro_CYCB1` promoter ensures expression is specifically activated during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In wild-type root cells, the PMEI-GFP signal appears as a transient fluorescent ring where the cell plate meets the parental wall, which then disappears upon successful fusion and maturation of the new wall.\n\nUsing Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS) for mutagenesis, the biologist screens for mutants with aberrant PMEI-GFP signals. They isolate a mutant named `cpf1` (cell plate fusion 1). In `cpf1` homozygotes, the cell plate forms and expands correctly, but fails to fuse with the parental wall. This results in a persistent, stable ring of PMEI-GFP fluorescence at the cell periphery and the presence of an unattached cell plate \"stub\". Genetic analysis reveals `CPF1` encodes a polygalacturonase, an enzyme that digests pectin in the primary cell wall.\n\nTo understand the genetic pathway, the biologist decides to create a double mutant between `cpf1` and `knolle`, a well-known cytokinesis mutant. The `KNOLLE` gene encodes a syntaxin protein required for the very first step of cell plate formation: the fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles at the cell equator. As a result, null `knolle` mutants completely lack a cell plate and become large, multinucleate cells.\n\nAssuming a complete loss-of-function for both mutations, what is the most likely phenotype to be observed in root meristem cells of the `cpf1 knolle` double mutant?\n\nA. A wild-type phenotype, where normal cytokinesis is restored due to mutual suppression of the two mutations.\n\nB. The `cpf1` phenotype (a persistent PMEI-GFP ring at the cell periphery), because the `cpf1` mutation's effect on fusion is the terminal step in the pathway.\n\nC. The `knolle` phenotype (large, multinucleate cells with no cell plate and no organized PMEI-GFP ring), because `KNOLLE` function is required before `CPF1` function.\n\nD. A novel, more severe phenotype characterized by disorganized clusters of PMEI-GFP and fragmented cell plate material throughout the cytoplasm, indicating a synergistic interaction.\n\nE. The `cpf1` and `knolle` phenotypes appearing in different cells of the same root, indicating tissue-specific pathway dependence.", "solution": "1) Order of biological steps: Cytokinesis in plant cells proceeds in a linear sequence: (i) initiation of the cell plate by fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles at the cell equator, which requires the syntaxin KNOLLE; (ii) expansion of the cell plate; (iii) fusion of the expanding cell plate with the parental wall at the cortex, which requires remodeling of pectin and, here, CPF1 polygalacturonase activity. The PMEI-GFP reporter is targeted to the expanding cell plate edge and appears as a transient ring at the cortex upon plate-wall contact; it disappears after successful fusion.\n\n2) Single-mutant phenotypes: In cpf1 loss-of-function, steps (i) and (ii) occur, but step (iii) fails; thus a stable cortical PMEI-GFP ring persists and an unattached plate “stub” remains. In knolle null mutants, step (i) fails; no cell plate forms and cells become multinucleate; consequently there is no organized PMEI-GFP ring at the cortex.\n\n3) Epistasis principle: In a linear pathway, a mutation blocking an earlier, necessary step is epistatic to a mutation affecting a later step, because the later step cannot occur without completion of the earlier step. Therefore, a null mutation in KNOLLE, which prevents cell plate initiation, should mask the phenotype caused by loss of CPF1, which acts only after a plate has formed and reached the parental wall.\n\n4) Double-mutant prediction: In cpf1 knolle with complete loss of function for both, the absence of KNOLLE function prevents cell plate initiation; without a plate there can be no cortical contact and no substrate for CPF1-dependent fusion. Thus the cpf1 phenotype (persistent PMEI-GFP ring and plate stub) cannot manifest. The expected phenotype is the knolle phenotype: large, multinucleate cells lacking a cell plate and lacking an organized cortical PMEI-GFP ring.\n\n5) Exclusion of alternatives: Mutual suppression (A) is not expected for two essential, nonredundant, sequential functions; the terminal-step dominance (B) is invalid because the terminal step is never reached; a novel synergistic pattern (D) requires partial activities or parallel pathways, not two complete early and late null blocks in a linear pathway; mosaic expression (E) contradicts uniform genotype in the root meristem under the given assumptions.\n\nConclusion: KNOLLE acts upstream of CPF1 and is epistatic; the double mutant exhibits the knolle phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1480889"}]}
