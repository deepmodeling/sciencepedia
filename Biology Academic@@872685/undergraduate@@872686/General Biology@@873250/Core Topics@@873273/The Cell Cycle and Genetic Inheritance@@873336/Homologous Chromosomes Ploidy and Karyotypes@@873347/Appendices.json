{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of cell biology is the ability to interpret the dynamic dance of chromosomes during cell division. This exercise challenges you to act as a cytogeneticist, analyzing a snapshot of a dividing cell to determine its precise stage. By carefully considering the chromosome count, structure, and alignment, you can distinguish between the intricate phases of mitosis and meiosis, a critical skill for understanding both normal development and the origins of chromosomal abnormalities [@problem_id:2298151].", "problem": "Exobiologists studying the reproductive cycle of a newly discovered multicellular organism, *Xenothrix martiana*, have determined from its somatic cell karyotype that it is a diploid organism with a chromosome number of $2n=40$. During an investigation of its gametogenesis, a single dividing cell is isolated and prepared for microscopic analysis. The observation reveals that there are 20 distinct chromosome structures aligned along the cell's equatorial plane, also known as the metaphase plate. Each of these 20 structures is composed of two sister chromatids joined at a centromere.\n\nBased on this cytological evidence, identify the specific stage of cell division being observed.\n\nA. Metaphase of Mitosis\n\nB. Anaphase I of Meiosis\n\nC. Metaphase I of Meiosis\n\nD. Prophase II of Meiosis\n\nE. Metaphase II of Meiosis\n\nF. Anaphase II of Meiosis", "solution": "The organism is diploid with $2n=40$, so the haploid number is $n=20$.\n\nAt metaphase of mitosis, all replicated chromosomes align individually at the metaphase plate; the number of chromosomes observed would be $2n=40$, each consisting of two sister chromatids joined at one centromere. Since only 20 such structures are observed, this excludes mitotic metaphase.\n\nIn meiosis I, at metaphase I, homologous chromosomes pair as bivalents (tetrads). The number of aligned units is $n=20$, but each unit is a bivalent composed of two homologous chromosomes, hence four chromatids and two centromeres per bivalent. The observation states that each of the 20 structures consists of two sister chromatids joined at a single centromere, which are monovalent chromosomes, not bivalents. Therefore, this is not metaphase I.\n\nAnaphase I and anaphase II involve segregation toward poles rather than alignment at the equatorial plane, so stages B and F are inconsistent with the observation. Prophase II precedes alignment at the metaphase plate, so stage D is also inconsistent.\n\nIn meiosis II, each cell is haploid with $n=20$ chromosomes. At metaphase II, these $n=20$ chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, each chromosome consisting of two sister chromatids joined at one centromere. This exactly matches the observation of 20 structures, each with two sister chromatids at a single centromere, aligned at the equatorial plane.\n\nTherefore, the stage is metaphase II of meiosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2298151"}, {"introduction": "Moving from normal cell division to its imperfections, we now explore the consequences of meiotic errors such as nondisjunction, which leads to aneuploidy. This practice uses the clinically significant example of Trisomy 21 to model how an incorrect chromosome number affects gamete formation. Working through this scenario allows you to quantitatively predict the types of gametes an affected individual might produce, a crucial concept for understanding the inheritance of chromosomal disorders [@problem_id:2298150].", "problem": "An individual has Trisomy 21, a genetic condition characterized by the presence of three homologous copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. Assume that during spermatogenesis in this individual, the most common meiotic event for chromosome 21 is the formation of a trivalent structure during prophase I. This trivalent segregates during anaphase I such that two of the homologous chromosomes move to one secondary spermatocyte, and the remaining one moves to the other. Further assume that meiosis II proceeds without any chromosomal errors in all secondary spermatocytes.\n\nBased on this specific segregation model, what are the theoretical proportions of euploid (containing one copy of chromosome 21) and aneuploid (containing an abnormal number of chromosome 21) gametes that this individual would produce?\n\nA. 100% aneuploid gametes.\n\nB. 66.7% aneuploid gametes and 33.3% euploid gametes.\n\nC. 50% aneuploid gametes and 50% euploid gametes.\n\nD. 25% ($n+1$) aneuploid gametes, 25% ($n-1$) aneuploid gametes, and 50% euploid gametes.\n\nE. 25% aneuploid gametes and 75% euploid gametes.", "solution": "The individual is trisomic for chromosome 21, so a primary spermatocyte contains three homologous copies of chromosome 21. By assumption, during prophase I a trivalent forms, and at anaphase I a 2:1 segregation occurs: two homologs go to one secondary spermatocyte (call this cell A) and one homolog goes to the other secondary spermatocyte (cell B).\n\nMeiosis II proceeds without error in both secondary spermatocytes. For chromosome 21:\n\n- In cell A (which received two homologs), each homolog consists of sister chromatids prior to meiosis II. At anaphase II, sister chromatids separate equationally. Each of the two resulting gametes from cell A receives one chromatid from each of the two homologs. Therefore, each gamete from cell A contains two copies of chromosome 21, i.e., is an aneuploid gamete of type $n+1$.\n\n- In cell B (which received one homolog), at anaphase II the sister chromatids of that single homolog separate equationally. Each of the two resulting gametes from cell B receives one chromatid of chromosome 21. Therefore, each gamete from cell B contains one copy of chromosome 21, i.e., is a euploid gamete.\n\nSince each meiosis yields two gametes from cell A (both aneuploid $n+1$) and two gametes from cell B (both euploid), the proportions are\n$$\nP(\\text{aneuploid})=\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{2},\\qquad P(\\text{euploid})=\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nNo $n-1$ gametes arise under the stated segregation model and the assumption of error-free meiosis II.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2298150"}, {"introduction": "Beyond changes in chromosome number, alterations in chromosome structure also have profound implications for heredity. This problem examines a balanced reciprocal translocation, a rearrangement where a carrier can be perfectly healthy but produce genetically unbalanced gametes.

Karyotyping reveals that they are a healthy carrier of a balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosome 8 and the long arm of chromosome 14.

The derived, translocated chromosomes are denoted as T8 (the majority of chromosome 8 with a piece of chromosome 14) and T14 (the majority of chromosome 14 with a piece of chromosome 8). Thus, the somatic cells of this individual contain the set {N8, T8, N14, T14} in addition to all other normal chromosome pairs.\n\nDuring prophase I of meiosis, these four chromosomes form a characteristic cruciform quadrivalent structure to allow for the pairing of homologous segments.

In prophase I, these form a quadrivalent; at anaphase I, the centromeres can segregate in several characteristic ways. Each segregation pattern yields two complementary sets at anaphase I (which then produce two pairs of equivalent gametes after meiosis II).
