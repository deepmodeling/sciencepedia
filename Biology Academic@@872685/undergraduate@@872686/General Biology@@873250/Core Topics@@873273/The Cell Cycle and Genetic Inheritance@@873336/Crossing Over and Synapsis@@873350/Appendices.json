This first exercise focuses on synapsis, the precise pairing of homologous chromosomes that forms structures called bivalents. By determining the number of bivalents in a cell with a known chromosome count [@problem_id:2288903], you will solidify your understanding of the relationship between an organism's diploid number ($2n$) and its haploid number ($n$), which is the basis for all subsequent meiotic events.", "problem": "The common onion, *Allium cepa*, is a diploid organism. A typical somatic cell from an onion root tip is observed to have a total of 16 chromosomes. Consider a germline cell from this same onion plant that enters meiosis. During prophase I of this process, homologous chromosomes pair up in a precise alignment known as synapsis.

The haploid number is therefore\n$$\nn = \\frac{2n}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8.\n$$\nDuring prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo synapsis, pairing into bivalents. By definition, the number of bivalents equals the number of homologous pairs, which is the haploid number $n$.

Crossing over is a physical breakage and rejoining of DNA, but it can be difficult to picture. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2288919] uses fluorescently labeled chromosomes to provide a powerful and intuitive model of a crossover event, helping you trace the fate of each of the four chromatids. Understanding how a single exchange between non-sister chromatids yields two parental and two recombinant products is crucial for grasping how meiosis is a primary engine of genetic diversity.", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, researchers are studying the process of meiosis in a genetically engineered organism. They have tagged a specific pair of homologous chromosomes with fluorescent markers. The chromosome inherited from the maternal parent carries a gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), causing it to glow bright green under specific lighting conditions. The homologous chromosome inherited from the paternal parent carries a gene for Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), causing it to glow red.\n\nA germline cell from this organism, containing this pair of tagged chromosomes, is observed as it enters meiosis. It is known that after DNA replication and the pairing of homologous chromosomes in prophase I, a single crossover event occurs at a location approximately one-quarter of the way from the end of one arm of the paired chromosomes.\n\nAssuming the cell is viewed with a fluorescence microscope just before the start of anaphase I, which of the following statements most accurately describes the appearance of the resulting bivalent structure?\n\nA. The bivalent consists of two chromatids. One chromatid is mostly green with a red segment at its end, and the homologous chromatid is mostly red with a green segment at its end.\n\nB. The bivalent consists of four chromatids: two are entirely green and two are entirely red, with no mixing of colors observed.\n\nC. The bivalent consists of four chromatids. One chromatid is entirely green, one chromatid is entirely red, one chromatid is mostly green with a red segment at its end, and one chromatid is mostly red with a green segment at its end.\n\nD. The bivalent consists of four chromatids. All four chromatids appear as mosaics, each containing multiple, alternating segments of green and red fluorescence.\n\nE. The bivalent consists of four chromatids, all of which fluoresce a uniform yellow-orange color, indicating a complete fusion and mixing of the GFP and RFP molecules.", "solution": "To determine the appearance of the bivalent, we must trace the state of the chromosomes through the initial stages of meiosis.\n\n**Initial State:** Before meiosis begins, the diploid cell has one green-tagged maternal chromosome and one red-tagged paternal homologous chromosome.\n\n**Step 1: DNA Replication (Interphase before Meiosis I)**\nBefore meiosis I, the cell undergoes the S phase of interphase, where all DNA is replicated. The green maternal chromosome replicates to form two identical sister chromatids, which are both entirely green and joined at a centromere. Similarly, the red paternal chromosome replicates to form two identical sister chromatids, which are both entirely red.\n\n**Step 2: Synapsis (Prophase I)**\nDuring prophase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes pair up in a process called synapsis. The replicated green chromosome (consisting of two green sister chromatids) aligns with the replicated red chromosome (consisting of two red sister chromatids). This paired structure of four chromatids is called a bivalent or a tetrad. At this point, before any crossing over, the bivalent consists of two purely green chromatids and two purely red chromatids.\n\n**Step 3: Crossing Over (Prophase I)**\nThe problem states that a single crossover event occurs. A crucial principle of meiosis is that crossing over involves the exchange of genetic material between **non-sister chromatids** within a homologous pair. It does not occur between sister chromatids (e.g., between the two green chromatids).\n\nTherefore, one of the green chromatids will break and exchange a segment with one of the red chromatids. The other green chromatid and the other red chromatid are not involved in this specific exchange.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Resulting Chromatids**\nLet's analyze the composition of the four chromatids after this single crossover event:\n1.  **One Sister Chromatid (Maternal):** This chromatid was not involved in the crossover. It remains entirely green.\n2.  **The Other Sister Chromatid (Maternal):** This chromatid was involved in the crossover. It is now a recombinant chromatid. Since it exchanged its end segment with the red chromatid, it will be mostly green with a red segment at its end.\n3.  **One Sister Chromatid (Paternal):** This chromatid was not involved in the crossover. It remains entirely red.\n4.  **The Other Sister Chromatid (Paternal):** This chromatid was involved in the crossover. It is the reciprocal recombinant chromatid. It gave its red end segment to the green chromatid and received a green end segment in return. Therefore, it will be mostly red with a green segment at its end.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe bivalent, viewed just before anaphase I, is a structure composed of these four chromatids held together by centromeres (linking sister chromatids) and the chiasma (the physical site of crossing over). The structure contains: one entirely green chromatid, one entirely red chromatid, one mostly green chromatid with a red tip, and one mostly red chromatid with a green tip. This description perfectly matches option C.\n\nLet's evaluate the incorrect options:\n-   **A** is incorrect because it ignores the DNA replication step, describing a bivalent with only two chromatids instead of four.\n-   **B** is incorrect because it describes the state *before* crossing over has occurred, or what would happen if the crossover occurred between sister chromatids, which is not the function of meiotic crossing over.\n-   **D** is incorrect as it implies multiple crossover events occurred along all chromatids, contrary to the problem statement of a *single* crossover event.\n-   **E** is incorrect because it reflects a misunderstanding of the physical process. The fluorescent proteins are attached to the chromosome structure; they do not detach and mix like liquids. The exchange is of large DNA segments, not a molecular-level blending of proteins.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2288919"}, {"introduction": "The principles of crossing over are not just theoretical; they are the foundation of genetic mapping. This final practice demonstrates how the frequency of recombination events between linked genes can be used to measure their relative distance on a chromosome.
