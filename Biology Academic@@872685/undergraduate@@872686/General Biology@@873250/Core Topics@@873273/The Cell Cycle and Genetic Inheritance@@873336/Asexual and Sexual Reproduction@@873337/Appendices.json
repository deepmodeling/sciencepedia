The frequency of this shuffling, known as the recombination frequency, can be measured experimentally. This practice problem guides you through the classic method of using a test cross to interpret offspring data, allowing you to calculate the rate at which new allele combinations are generated during meiosis. [@problem_id:2314726]", "problem": "A marine biologist is studying the genetics of a fictional deep-sea organism, the Glimmerfin Squid (*Phototeuthis luminosus*). Two traits are of particular interest: the color of its bioluminescence and the type of ink it produces. The allele for blue bioluminescence ($B$) is dominant over the allele for green bioluminescence ($b$), and the allele for standard black ink ($I$) is dominant over the allele for a paralytic clear ink ($i$).\n\nThe biologist starts by performing a cross between two pure-breeding (homozygous) individuals. One parent exhibits blue bioluminescence and produces standard ink, while the other exhibits green bioluminescence and produces paralytic ink. All offspring in this first filial (F1) generation display blue bioluminescence and produce standard ink.\n\nNext, a test cross is conducted by mating an F1 individual with an individual that has green bioluminescence and paralytic ink. A large number of offspring are produced and categorized by their traits, with the following results:\n- 820 offspring with blue bioluminescence and standard ink\n- 820 offspring with green bioluminescence and paralytic ink\n- 180 offspring with blue bioluminescence and paralytic ink\n- 180 offspring with green bioluminescence and standard ink\n\nBased on these results, what is the frequency of gametes produced by the F1 generation that contain a combination of alleles not present in the original pure-breeding parents? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the frequency of specific types of gametes produced by the F1 generation, based on the phenotypic results of a test cross.\n\nFirst, let's establish the genotypes of the organisms involved.\nThe P (parental) generation consists of two pure-breeding individuals. The parent with blue bioluminescence and standard ink is homozygous dominant for both traits, with genotype $BBII$. The parent with green bioluminescence and paralytic ink is homozygous recessive for both traits, with genotype $bbii$.\n\nThe cross between these two parents ($BBII \\times bbii$) produces the F1 generation. All F1 individuals will be heterozygous for both genes, with the genotype $BbIi$. Because of their parentage, one chromosome in each F1 individual carries the alleles $B$ and $I$, while the homologous chromosome carries the alleles $b$ and $i$. The phenotype of the F1 generation is blue bioluminescence and standard ink, consistent with the dominance of the $B$ and $I$ alleles.\n\nNext, a test cross is performed by mating an F1 individual ($BbIi$) with a homozygous recessive individual ($bbii$). The purpose of a test cross is to determine the gametes produced by the heterozygous parent, as the gametes from the homozygous recessive parent ($bi$) will not mask the expression of the alleles from the F1 parent in the offspring. Therefore, the phenotype of each offspring directly reveals the genetic content of the gamete contributed by the F1 parent.\n\nThe F1 parent ($BbIi$) can produce four types of gametes through meiosis. If the genes for bioluminescence and ink type assorted independently, these four gamete types ($BI$, $Bi$, $bI$, $bi$) would be produced in equal proportions (25% each), leading to a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio in the test cross offspring. However, the observed offspring counts are not equal, indicating that the genes are linked (located on the same chromosome) and do not assort independently.\n\nThe observed offspring phenotypes are:\n1.  Blue bioluminescence, standard ink (Genotype: $BbIi$): 820 individuals. This phenotype arises from an F1 gamete of type $BI$.\n2.  Green bioluminescence, paralytic ink (Genotype: $bbii$): 820 individuals. This phenotype arises from an F1 gamete of type $bi$.\n3.  Blue bioluminescence, paralytic ink (Genotype: $Bbii$): 180 individuals. This phenotype arises from an F1 gamete of type $Bi$.\n4.  Green bioluminescence, standard ink (Genotype: $bbIi$): 180 individuals. This phenotype arises from an F1 gamete of type $bI$.\n\nThe question asks for the frequency of gametes with allele combinations \"not present in the original pure-breeding parents\". The original P-generation parents contributed chromosomes with allele combinations of ($B$, $I$) and ($b$, $i$). Therefore, the gametes with these allele combinations ($BI$ and $bi$) are considered \"parental\" types. The offspring showing these parental trait combinations are the most numerous (820 of each), which is characteristic of linked genes.\n\nThe gametes with \"new\" combinations of alleles, those not found in the P generation, are $Bi$ and $bI$. These are called \"recombinant\" gametes, and they are formed as a result of crossing over between the two gene loci during meiosis in the F1 parent. The offspring displaying these recombinant phenotypes are those with blue bioluminescence/paralytic ink and green bioluminescence/standard ink.\n\nThe frequency of these recombinant gametes is calculated as the proportion of recombinant offspring relative to the total number of offspring.\n\nTotal number of offspring = $820 + 820 + 180 + 180 = 2000$.\nNumber of recombinant offspring = (Number with blue, paralytic ink) + (Number with green, standard ink) = $180 + 180 = 360$.\n\nThe frequency of recombinant gametes is therefore:\n$$ \\text{Frequency} = \\frac{\\text{Number of recombinant offspring}}{\\text{Total number of offspring}} $$\n$$ \\text{Frequency} = \\frac{360}{2000} = 0.18 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$0.18$ expressed to three significant figures is $0.180$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.180}$$", "id": "2314726"}, {"introduction": "The distinction between sexual and asexual reproduction is not always simple, as asexual strategies themselves vary in their mechanisms and genetic consequences. This problem provides a quantitative comparison between two forms of asexual reproduction: apomixis (cloning) and a specific type of automixis (meiotic parthenogenesis). By calculating the change in heterozygosity for each mode, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how different reproductive pathways, such as those that retain or lose heterozygosity, impact genetic inheritance and the potential for evolutionary change. [@problem_id:2280260]", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the method of reproduction has profound consequences for the genetic makeup of subsequent generations. Consider a hypothetical diploid organism that is heterozygous at a specific genetic locus, with genotype $Gg$. This organism can reproduce asexually via two distinct mechanisms:\n\n1.  **Apomixis**: A form of asexual reproduction where a diploid egg cell is formed through mitosis, and subsequently develops into an embryo without fertilization. The resulting offspring is a genetic clone of the parent.\n2.  **Automictic Parthenogenesis with Central Fusion**: A form of asexual reproduction where an egg cell undergoes a standard meiosis. The resulting haploid ootid nucleus then fuses with the haploid nucleus of its associated second polar body to restore diploidy and initiate development.\n\nLet $y$ be the probability that the locus $G$ undergoes second-division segregation. This occurs when a crossover event between the locus and the centromere causes the heterozygous alleles to separate during the second meiotic division (Meiosis II) rather than the first (Meiosis I).\n\nStarting with the single heterozygous parent ($Gg$), we define the expected heterozygosity of a first-generation offspring as the probability that the offspring is also heterozygous. Let $H_{\\text{apo}}$ be the expected heterozygosity of an offspring produced via apomixis, and $H_{\\text{auto}}$ be the expected heterozygosity of an offspring produced via automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion.\n\nCalculate the value of the expression $H_{\\text{apo}} - H_{\\text{auto}}$ as a function of $y$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the quantity $H_{\\text{apo}} - H_{\\text{auto}}$, where $H_{\\text{apo}}$ and $H_{\\text{auto}}$ are the expected heterozygosities of an offspring produced by a heterozygous parent ($Gg$) via apomixis and automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion, respectively. We will calculate each term separately. The expected heterozygosity of an offspring is equivalent to the probability that the offspring has a heterozygous genotype ($Gg$).\n\nFirst, let's determine $H_{\\text{apo}}$.\nApomixis is defined as reproduction through a diploid egg cell formed via mitosis. Mitosis is a process of cell division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. Therefore, an egg cell produced by a parent with genotype $Gg$ will also have the genotype $Gg$. Since this egg develops directly into an offspring without fertilization, the offspring will be a perfect genetic clone of the parent.\nThe parent's genotype is $Gg$ (heterozygous).\nThe offspring's genotype will also be $Gg$ (heterozygous).\nThe probability that the offspring is heterozygous is 1.\nThus, the expected heterozygosity under apomixis is:\n$$H_{apo} = 1$$\n\nNext, let's determine $H_{\\text{auto}}$.\nAutomictic parthenogenesis with central fusion involves meiosis. The outcome for heterozygosity depends on whether the locus $G$ undergoes first-division segregation or second-division segregation.\n\nCase 1: First-Division Segregation (FDS)\nThis occurs with a probability of $1-y$. In FDS, the homologous chromosomes carrying the $G$ and $g$ alleles separate during Meiosis I. This means that the secondary oocyte, which proceeds to Meiosis II, will be homozygous—it will contain two identical sister chromatids, either both carrying $G$ or both carrying $g$. Meiosis II then separates these sister chromatids. The ootid will receive one allele (e.g., $G$) and the second polar body will receive the identical allele ($G$). When central fusion occurs, the fusion of the ootid nucleus ($G$) and the second polar body nucleus ($G$) results in a homozygous diploid offspring ($GG$). The same logic applies if the secondary oocyte received the $g$ allele, resulting in a $gg$ offspring. In either scenario, the offspring is homozygous.\nThe probability of obtaining a heterozygous offspring, given FDS, is 0.\n\nCase 2: Second-Division Segregation (SDS)\nThis occurs with a probability of $y$. In SDS, due to a crossover between the gene and the centromere, the homologous chromosomes that separate in Meiosis I are each still heterozygous (i.e., they carry non-identical sister chromatids, one with $G$ and one with $g$). The secondary oocyte thus receives a chromosome with both a $G$ and a $g$ chromatid. During Meiosis II, these non-identical sister chromatids separate. The ootid will receive one allele (e.g., $G$), and the second polar body will receive the other allele ($g$). Central fusion then combines the ootid nucleus ($G$) and the second polar body nucleus ($g$). This fusion restores diploidy and results in a heterozygous genotype ($Gg$).\nThe probability of obtaining a heterozygous offspring, given SDS, is 1.\n\nTo find the overall expected heterozygosity $H_{\\text{auto}}$, we use the law of total probability:\n$$H_{\\text{auto}} = P(\\text{offspring is Gg})$$\n$$H_{\\text{auto}} = P(\\text{offspring is Gg} | \\text{FDS}) \\times P(\\text{FDS}) + P(\\text{offspring is Gg} | \\text{SDS}) \\times P(\\text{SDS})$$\nSubstituting the probabilities we determined:\n$$H_{\\text{auto}} = (0) \\times (1-y) + (1) \\times (y)$$\n$$H_{\\text{auto}} = y$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the expression $H_{\\text{apo}} - H_{\\text{auto}}$ using the values we have derived.\n$$H_{\\text{apo}} - H_{\\text{auto}} = 1 - y$$\nThis expression represents the loss of heterozygosity in one generation of automixis with central fusion, as apomixis preserves heterozygosity completely.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1-y}$$", "id": "2280260"}]}
