To prevent this from occurring prematurely, the cell employs a powerful molecular \"brake\" in the form of the Wee1 kinase. This exercise [@problem_id:2283827] presents a thought experiment where this crucial inhibitory brake is removed, challenging you to predict how this affects the timing of mitotic entry and appreciate the importance of negative regulation in cell cycle control.", "problem": "The transition from the G2 phase to the M (mitosis) phase of the cell cycle is a tightly regulated process in eukaryotic cells. The key molecular machine driving this transition is the Mitosis-Promoting Factor (MPF), a protein complex composed of Cyclin B and a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1). The activity of MPF is controlled by phosphorylation. As Cyclin B accumulates during the G2 phase, it binds to CDK1. This newly formed MPF complex is then immediately phosphorylated on an inhibitory site by the Wee1 kinase, rendering it inactive. This allows the cell to build up a large stockpile of inactive MPF. At the proper time, the phosphatase Cdc25 removes this inhibitory phosphate, leading to a rapid and widespread activation of MPF, which robustly triggers entry into mitosis.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered cell line where the endogenous CDK1 gene has been replaced with a mutant version. This mutant CDK1 protein functions normally in every respect (it can bind Cyclin B and phosphorylate its targets) except for one change: the specific amino acid residue that is normally phosphorylated by Wee1 kinase has been altered, such that Wee1 can no longer phosphorylate or inhibit this mutant CDK1.\n\nAssuming all other cellular components, including Cyclin B, Wee1, and Cdc25, are normal and functional, what is the most likely consequence for this engineered cell line compared to a normal, wild-type cell line?\n\nA. The cell will enter mitosis prematurely.\n\nB. The cell will be delayed in entering mitosis.\n\nC. The cell will arrest in the G2 phase and will not enter mitosis.\n\nD. The timing of entry into mitosis will be unaffected.\n\nE. The cell will enter mitosis normally but will arrest in anaphase.", "solution": "1. In a normal cell, Cyclin B accumulates during G2 and binds CDK1 to form MPF. Immediately after formation, Wee1 phosphorylates CDK1 on its inhibitory site, keeping MPF inactive. This allows the cell to stockpile inactive MPF. At the appropriate time, Cdc25 removes the inhibitory phosphate, triggering a rapid, switch-like activation of MPF and synchronous entry into mitosis.\n\n2. In the engineered cell, the Wee1 phosphorylation site on CDK1 is altered so that Wee1 cannot phosphorylate or inhibit CDK1. All other functions of CDK1, including binding Cyclin B and target phosphorylation, remain intact, and the activating phosphorylation by CAK is still possible because only the Wee1 site is altered.\n\n3. Without the inhibitory phosphorylation by Wee1, newly formed Cyclin B–CDK1 complexes will not be held inactive. Because CAK activity is generally constitutive, the Cyclin B–CDK1 complex will become active as soon as Cyclin B accumulates and binds CDK1, without requiring Cdc25 to remove an inhibitory phosphate.\n\n4. Consequently, the cell cannot build a stockpile of inactive MPF, and MPF activity will rise earlier and more gradually with Cyclin B accumulation. This removes a critical inhibitory checkpoint and advances the timing of mitotic entry relative to wild-type cells.\n\n5. Therefore, the most likely outcome is premature entry into mitosis compared to the normal cell line.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2283827"}, {"introduction": "Just as critical as initiating mitosis is the ability to terminate it, allowing the cell to divide and reset for the next cycle. This process is not a simple reversal; it requires an entirely different set of molecular machinery to actively drive mitotic exit. This practice [@problem_id:2283816] explores the consequence of disabling the key \"off-switch\"—the degradation of Cyclin B—forcing you to consider why the destruction of proteins is as important as their synthesis for creating a unidirectional and orderly cell cycle.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, researchers are investigating the regulatory mechanisms of the cell cycle. They focus on Cyclin B, a protein whose levels must oscillate precisely for mitosis to proceed correctly. Cyclin B partners with a specific Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) to form a complex that drives the cell into mitosis. Normally, Cyclin B is rapidly degraded at a specific point during mitosis to allow the cell to exit this phase and divide.\n\nThe researchers engineer a special line of vertebrate somatic cells. In these cells, the gene for Cyclin B has been replaced with a gene that codes for a mutant form of Cyclin B. This mutant Cyclin B protein functions identically to the normal version in binding and activating its partner CDK, but it lacks the specific recognition site required for it to be tagged for proteasomal degradation. Assuming all other cellular proteins and systems are normal, at which of the following stages would a cell from this engineered line most likely become permanently arrested?\n\nA. G1 phase\n\nB. S phase\n\nC. Interphase\n\nD. Metaphase\n\nE. Telophase", "solution": "Goal: Determine the stage at which cells expressing nondegradable Cyclin B arrest.\n\n1. Principle of mitotic entry and exit: Cyclin B binds and activates its partner CDK (CDK1) to form MPF, which drives entry into and maintenance of mitosis by phosphorylating numerous mitotic substrates. Timely exit from mitosis requires inactivation of MPF, which is achieved by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of Cyclin B. This targeting is executed by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which recognizes a specific destruction motif (for example, a D-box) on Cyclin B.\n\n2. Timing of Cyclin B degradation: At the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, APC/C activated by Cdc20 ubiquitinates securin (allowing separase activation and cohesin cleavage) and Cyclin B (leading to MPF inactivation). The drop in MPF activity is necessary both for anaphase progression and for full mitotic exit (chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope reformation, and cytokinesis).\n\n3. Effect of nondegradable Cyclin B: If Cyclin B lacks the APC/C recognition site, it cannot be ubiquitinated and degraded. Consequently, MPF activity remains high. Persistent MPF activity prevents the dephosphorylation events required for anaphase onset and mitotic exit. In particular, separase activation depends not only on securin degradation but also on relief from inhibitory phosphorylation maintained by active CDK; thus with CDK activity sustained, sister chromatid separation and subsequent steps cannot proceed.\n\n4. Predicted arrest point: Because the metaphase-to-anaphase transition cannot be executed without Cyclin B degradation and consequent MPF inactivation, the cell cannot initiate anaphase. Therefore, the cell arrests in mitosis at metaphase. Options involving G1, S, or interphase are incorrect because the block is specific to mitotic progression. Telophase cannot be reached because it occurs after anaphase.\n\nConclusion: The engineered cells would become permanently arrested at metaphase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2283816"}, {"introduction": "Mitosis is not a single event but a beautifully choreographed sequence of distinct processes, from chromosome condensation to the breakdown of the nuclear envelope. How does the cell ensure these events happen in the correct order? This exercise [@problem_id:2283825] introduces a more sophisticated concept: the cell uses the continuously rising activity of a single master kinase, M-CDK, as a timer. By setting different activity thresholds for each downstream event, the cell can orchestrate a complex temporal program, and this problem allows you to explore the logic of this elegant system.", "problem": "The transition from interphase to mitosis in eukaryotic cells is driven by the activation of the M-phase Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (M-CDK) complex. The gradual increase in M-CDK activity at the G2/M boundary orchestrates a sequence of major cellular events. Two such critical events are chromosome condensation and Nuclear Envelope Breakdown (NEB). These processes are initiated only when M-CDK activity surpasses specific, distinct thresholds.\n\nLet the catalytic activity of M-CDK be denoted by $A_{M}$.\n- The initiation of chromosome condensation requires $A_{M}$ to reach a threshold $T_{CC}$.\n- The initiation of Nuclear Envelope Breakdown requires $A_{M}$ to reach a higher threshold $T_{NEB}$.\nIt is established that $T_{CC} < T_{NEB}$.\n\nA cell biologist engineers a stable cell line expressing a modified M-CDK that is partially inhibited by a synthetic drug, \"Mitostatin.\" When a saturating concentration of Mitostatin is added to the culture medium, the maximum achievable M-CDK activity, $A_{max}$, is permanently capped. In these experimental conditions, the activity level is constrained such that $T_{CC} < A_{max} < T_{NEB}$.\n\nA synchronized population of these engineered cells, arrested in G1 phase, is released from the block and allowed to progress through the cell cycle in the continuous presence of a saturating concentration of Mitostatin. Which of the following options best describes the terminal state these cells will predominantly adopt?\n\nA. The cells will arrest in G2 phase, with decondensed chromosomes and an intact nuclear envelope.\n\nB. The cells will arrest in a prophase-like state, with condensed chromosomes but an intact nuclear envelope.\n\nC. The cells will enter anaphase but will be unable to complete cytokinesis.\n\nD. The cells will undergo Nuclear Envelope Breakdown but will fail to condense their chromosomes.\n\nE. The cells will arrest in a stable metaphase, with fully condensed chromosomes aligned on the metaphase plate.\n\nF. The cells will complete mitosis, but the entire process will be significantly slower than in untreated cells.", "solution": "Let the time-dependent M-CDK activity be $A_{M}(t)$, which normally rises during late G2 to trigger sequential mitotic events. Two thresholds govern event initiation:\n- Chromosome condensation initiates when $A_{M}(t)$ first satisfies $A_{M}(t) \\geq T_{CC}$.\n- Nuclear Envelope Breakdown initiates when $A_{M}(t)$ first satisfies $A_{M}(t) \\geq T_{NEB}$, with $T_{CC} < T_{NEB}$.\n\nUnder saturating Mitostatin, the activity is capped such that for all $t$,\n$$\nA_{M}(t) \\leq A_{\\max}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad T_{CC} < A_{\\max} < T_{NEB}.\n$$\n\nStep 1: Existence of condensation initiation. Since $A_{\\max} > T_{CC}$ and $A_{M}(t)$ increases as cells approach the G2/M transition, there exists a time $t_{CC}$ such that $A_{M}(t_{CC}) = T_{CC}$. Therefore, chromosome condensation is initiated at $t_{CC}$.\n\nStep 2: Impossibility of NEB. NEB requires $A_{M}(t) \\geq T_{NEB}$, but for all $t$ we have\n$$\nA_{M}(t) \\leq A_{\\max} < T_{NEB},\n$$\nso there is no time $t$ such that $A_{M}(t) \\geq T_{NEB}$. Therefore, NEB does not occur.\n\nStep 3: Consequences for mitotic progression. Without NEB, the nuclear envelope remains intact, preventing spindle microtubules from accessing chromosomes, precluding kinetochore–microtubule attachment, chromosome congression, metaphase alignment, and satisfaction of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Thus, anaphase onset and cytokinesis cannot occur. Because $A_{M}(t)$ remains at or above $T_{CC}$, chromosome condensation is maintained, yielding a stable prophase-like state with condensed chromosomes and an intact nuclear envelope.\n\nStep 4: Evaluation of options:\n- A is false because $A_{\\max} > T_{CC}$ ensures condensation occurs; the state is not G2 with decondensed chromosomes.\n- B is true: condensed chromosomes with an intact nuclear envelope (prophase-like arrest).\n- C, E, and F are false because NEB is required for metaphase, anaphase, and completion of mitosis, which cannot occur when $A_{M}(t) < T_{NEB}$ for all $t$.\n- D is false because achieving NEB without condensation would require $A_{M}(t) \\geq T_{NEB}$ while $A_{M}(t) < T_{CC}$, which contradicts $T_{CC} < T_{NEB}$ and the given $T_{CC} < A_{\\max} < T_{NEB}$.\n\nTherefore, the terminal state is a prophase-like arrest with condensed chromosomes and an intact nuclear envelope.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2283825"}]}
