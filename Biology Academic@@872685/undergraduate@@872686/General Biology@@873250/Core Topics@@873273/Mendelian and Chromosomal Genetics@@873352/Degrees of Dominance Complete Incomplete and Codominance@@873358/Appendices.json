It has two alleles: $C^P$ for purple skin and $C^W$ for white skin. A cross between a true-breeding purple-skinned plant and a true-breeding white-skinned plant results in an F1 generation where all individuals possess violet-colored skin.\n\nThe second gene, which controls fruit shape, assorts independently from the color gene. It has two alleles: $S^L$ for an elongated shape and $S^R$ for a round shape. For this trait, the allele for elongated shape ($S^L$) is completely dominant over the allele for round shape ($S^R$).\n\nThe botanist performs a dihybrid cross starting with a true-breeding plant that produces purple, elongated fruit and a true-breeding plant that produces white, round fruit.

Express your answer as a single fraction.", "solution": "The color locus has alleles $C^{P}$ (purple) and $C^{W}$ (white) with incomplete dominance, so $C^{P}C^{W}$ produces violet.

A key skill you will develop here is deducing parental genotypes from pedigree information, a fundamental practice in human genetics and genetic counseling.", "problem": "In humans, the ABO blood group system is determined by a gene with three alleles: $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$. Alleles $I^A$ and $I^B$ are codominant with each other, and both are completely dominant over the recessive allele $i$. The Rhesus (Rh) blood group system is determined by a separate gene with two alleles: $R$ (for Rh-positive) and $r$ (for Rh-negative), where $R$ is completely dominant over $r$. Assume these two genes assort independently.\n\nA man has type A, Rh-positive blood. His father had type B, Rh-negative blood, and his mother had type A, Rh-positive blood. This man plans to have a child with a woman who has type B, Rh-positive blood.

For Rh, Rh-positive is $RR$ or $Rr$, and Rh-negative is $rr$.\n\nDetermine the man’s ABO genotype: He is type A, his father is type B, and his mother is type A. A type B father must be $I^{B}I^{B}$ or $I^{B}i$. Since the man is type A, he cannot have received $I^{B}$ from his father; therefore the father must be $I^{B}i$ and transmitted $i$ to the man. Hence the man’s ABO genotype is $I^{A}i$.\n\nDetermine the woman’s ABO genotype: She is type B; her father is type O ($ii$) and her mother is type AB ($I^{A}I^{B}$). She must have received $i$ from her father and $I^{B}$ from her mother, so her ABO genotype is $I^{B}i$.\n\nCross the ABO genotypes $I^{A}i \\times I^{B}i$.
