This exercise challenges you to apply the core concepts of diploidy ($2n$) and haploidy ($n$) to a fern's life cycle, reinforcing how chromosome numbers change between the sporophyte and gametophyte generations. Mastering this fundamental principle is the first step to understanding more complex genetic phenomena. [@problem_id:1476986]", "problem": "A botanist specializing in paleobiology is studying a newly discovered species of living fossil fern. Through karyotyping, it is determined that the somatic cells, taken from the fronds of the mature fern (the sporophyte stage), contain 84 chromosomes. The life cycle of this fern follows the typical pattern of alternation of generations. The diploid sporophyte ($2n$) produces haploid spores ($n$) through the process of meiosis. These spores, when they land on a suitable substrate, germinate and grow into a small, independent, heart-shaped organism called a gametophyte. The gametophyte is haploid ($n$) and produces gametes (egg and sperm) via mitosis. Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell fuses with an egg cell, forming a diploid zygote ($2n$), which then develops into a new sporophyte, completing the cycle.\n\nBased on this complete biological description, determine the number of chromosomes you would expect to find in a single cell of the fern's gametophyte and in the zygote, respectively. Your answer should be a pair of integers.", "solution": "The problem states that the somatic cells of the mature fern (the sporophyte, which is diploid) contain 84 chromosomes. By definition of diploidy in this life cycle, the sporophyte has chromosome number $2n$, so:\n$$\n2n = 84.\n$$\nSolving for the haploid number $n$ gives:\n$$\nn = \\frac{84}{2} = 42.\n$$\nIn alternation of generations, meiosis in the diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores, so the gametophyte that develops from these spores is haploid with $n$ chromosomes. Therefore, a single cell of the gametophyte has:\n$$\nn = 42 \\text{ chromosomes}.\n$$\nGametes are produced by mitosis in the haploid gametophyte and thus are also $n=42$. At fertilization, fusion of two haploid gametes restores diploidy, producing a zygote with:\n$$\n2n = 84 \\text{ chromosomes}.\n$$\nThus, the expected chromosome numbers are $42$ for the gametophyte cell and $84$ for the zygote.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}42 & 84\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1476986"}, {"introduction": "A key piece of evidence for the chromosomal theory came from observing that some genes do not assort independently, because they are physically linked on the same chromosome. This practice provides a classic genetics experiment where you will analyze test cross data from *Drosophila* to calculate the recombination frequency between two linked genes. This exercise demonstrates how crossover events are used to measure the physical distance between genes, a technique that allows geneticists to map the very architecture of the genome.

A female fly, which was produced from the mating of a pure-breeding gray-bodied, normal-winged fly with a pure-breeding black-bodied, vestigial-winged fly, is mated with a black-bodied, vestigial-winged male fly. This cross produces 1000 offspring with the following phenotypic distribution:\n\n- 382 flies with gray bodies and normal wings\n- 378 flies with black bodies and vestigial wings\n- 121 flies with gray bodies and vestigial wings\n- 119 flies with black bodies and normal wings\n\nBased on these results, calculate the genetic map distance between the body color gene and the wing shape gene.
