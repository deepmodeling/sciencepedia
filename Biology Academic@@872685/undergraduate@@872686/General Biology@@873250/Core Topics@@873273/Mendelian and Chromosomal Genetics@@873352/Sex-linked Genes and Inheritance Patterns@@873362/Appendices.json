The allele for wild-type red eyes is dominant over the allele for mutant white eyes. A geneticist conducts an experiment by mating a female fruit fly that has red eyes with a male fruit fly that has white eyes. After the eggs hatch, the geneticist observes the F1 generation and finds, among other offspring, several female flies that have white eyes.\n\nLet $X^R$ represent the dominant allele for red eyes and $X^r$ represent the recessive allele for white eyes.

It is impossible to determine from the information given.", "solution": "Eye color in Drosophila is X-linked with red ($X^{R}$) dominant over white ($X^{r}$). The male parent has white eyes and is therefore hemizygous recessive with genotype $X^{r}Y$, since males are $XY$ and a white-eyed phenotype requires the single X to carry $X^{r}$. The female parent has red eyes, so her genotype must include at least one $X^{R}$. The possible genotypes for a red-eyed female are $X^{R}X^{R}$ or $X^{R}X^{r}$; the genotype $X^{r}X^{r}$ would produce white eyes and is inconsistent with the given phenotype, and $X^{R}Y$ is not a valid genotype for a female.\n\nAll daughters inherit the father’s X chromosome, which in this case is $X^{r}$. Therefore, every F1 daughter has the form $X^{?}X^{r}$, where the second X comes from the mother. For any F1 daughter to exhibit white eyes, her genotype must be $X^{r}X^{r}$, which requires that the mother contributes an $X^{r}$ gamete. Consequently, the mother must carry the $X^{r}$ allele. Combined with her red-eyed phenotype (which requires at least one $X^{R}$), the mother’s genotype must be $X^{R}X^{r}$.\n\nThus, the complete genotype of the P generation mother is $X^{R}X^{r}$, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2314338"}, {"introduction": "The principles of sex-linked inheritance are not confined to the familiar $XY$ system found in humans and fruit flies. This next practice problem challenges you to apply your knowledge to the $ZW$ system, common in birds, some reptiles, and insects, where the female is the heterogametic sex ($ZW$). Furthermore, it introduces the concept of incomplete dominance, demonstrating how gene expression can create intermediate phenotypes and add another layer to your analysis ([@problem_id:2314348]).", "problem": "In a fictional reptilian species known as the Crested Glidewing, sex is determined by a ZW system, where males are the homogametic sex (ZZ) and females are the heterogametic sex (ZW).

The W chromosome carries no corresponding allele for this trait.\n\nThe inheritance pattern exhibits incomplete dominance in males. A male with the $Z^{C^B}Z^{C^Y}$ genotype has green scales, an intermediate phenotype. A homozygous male can be either blue ($Z^{C^B}Z^{C^B}$) or yellow ($Z^{C^Y}Z^{C^Y}$).

In this final practice, you'll act as a genetic detective, using your understanding of X-linked inheritance to trace the origin of a chromosomal abnormality.

Let $X^C$ represent the allele for normal color vision and $X^c$ represent the allele for color blindness.

Red-green color blindness is X-linked recessive, so the phenotype is expressed when no $X^{C}$ allele is present.\n\nGiven:\n- Father has normal color vision $\\Rightarrow$ genotype $X^{C}Y$.\n- Mother has normal color vision but her father was color-blind. Since an affected male must be $X^{c}Y$, he necessarily passed $X^{c}$ to his daughter. Because the mother is phenotypically normal, her genotype must be $X^{C}X^{c}$ (carrier).\n- The son is Klinefelter (XXY) and color-blind. For an XXY individual to be color-blind, there must be no $X^{C}$ present; if an $X^{C}$ were present, the phenotype would be normal, as in $X^{C}X^{c}$ carriers. Therefore, the son’s sex chromosomes must be $X^{c}X^{c}Y$.\n\nAnalyze nondisjunction origins:\n\n1) Paternal nondisjunction during Meiosis I:\n- Produces sperm of type $XY$ or $\\varnothing$. The $XY$ sperm here would be $X^{C}Y$ (since the father’s X is $X^{C}$). Fertilizing a normal maternal egg ($X$) yields $XXY$ with at least one $X^{C}$ (either $X^{C}X^{c}Y$ or $X^{C}X^{C}Y$), which is not color-blind. Thus, this cannot produce the observed $X^{c}X^{c}Y$ son.\n\n2) Paternal nondisjunction during Meiosis II:\n- After normal Meiosis I segregation, Meiosis II nondisjunction yields $XX$ (both sister chromatids of $X^{C}$) or $YY$ sperm, or null gametes. Fertilization of an $X$ egg by $XX$ sperm gives $XXX$; fertilization by $YY$ gives $XYY$. Neither yields $XXY$. Therefore, paternal Meiosis II cannot account for the XXY son.\n\n3) Maternal nondisjunction during Meiosis I:\n- Produces eggs with both homologs $X^{C}$ and $X^{c}$, or $\\varnothing$. Fertilization by a paternal $Y$ yields $X^{C}X^{c}Y$ (XXY) with at least one $X^{C}$, hence not color-blind. Therefore, maternal Meiosis I does not match the observed phenotype.\n\n4) Maternal nondisjunction during Meiosis II:\n- Meiosis I separates homologs correctly, so one secondary oocyte carries $X^{C}$ and the other $X^{c}$. If nondisjunction occurs in the $X^{c}$ secondary oocyte at Meiosis II, an egg with two identical sister chromatids $X^{c}X^{c}$ can be produced. Fertilization by a paternal $Y$ yields $X^{c}X^{c}Y$ (XXY) with no $X^{C}$, which is color-blind. This exactly matches the observed Klinefelter, color-blind son.\n\nTherefore, the only meiotic error consistent with all data is nondisjunction in the mother during Meiosis II.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2314329"}]}
