The karyotype of a biologically male individual is represented as 46,XY. During spermatogenesis, this diploid cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid gametes.\n\nConsider a specific error in meiosis where nondisjunction of chromosome 13 occurs during Meiosis I in a primary spermatocyte of a human male.

In this case, nondisjunction of chromosome 13 occurs, meaning both homologous copies of chromosome 13 move to the same pole. Simultaneously, the X and Y chromosomes separate normally.\nThis results in two secondary spermatocytes:\n1.  One cell receives both copies of chromosome 13 and one sex chromosome (e.g., the X). This cell is disomic for chromosome 13 and has a chromosome count of n+1 = 24.\n2.  The other cell receives no copies of chromosome 13 and the other sex chromosome (the Y). This cell is nullisomic for chromosome 13 and has a chromosome count of n-1 = 22.\nDuring Meiosis II, sister chromatids separate.\n- The first secondary spermatocyte (n+1) divides to produce two sperm cells, both of which will be n+1. Their karyotype will be $24,X,+13$.\n- The second secondary spermatocyte (n-1) divides to produce two sperm cells, both of which will be n-1.

This is not just an academic exercise; it provides valuable insights for genetic counseling and research into the mechanisms of nondisjunction. This problem [@problem_id:2286463] guides you through a classic logic puzzle using genetic markers to trace the path of the chromosomes and uncover the source of a trisomy.", "problem": "Down syndrome is a genetic condition typically caused by Trisomy 21, where an individual has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. This is the result of a chromosomal nondisjunction event—the failure of chromosomes to separate properly—during meiosis in one of the parents. By analyzing unique genetic markers on chromosome 21, it is possible to trace the origin of the extra chromosome.\n\nConsider a family where the child has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. A specific gene locus on chromosome 21 is analyzed for all three individuals. The two distinct alleles of this gene found in the mother are designated M1 and M2, so her genotype is (M1, M2). The two distinct alleles found in the father are designated P1 and P2, so his genotype is (P1, P2). Genetic analysis of the child reveals that their cells contain the alleles M1, P1, and P2.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly identifies the parent and the specific meiotic stage in which the nondisjunction event occurred?\n\nA. Nondisjunction occurred in the father during Meiosis I.\n\nB. Nondisjunction occurred in the father during Meiosis II.\n\nC. Nondisjunction occurred in the mother during Meiosis I.\n\nD. Nondisjunction occurred in the mother during Meiosis II.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine the origin with the given information.", "solution": "We are given that the mother is heterozygous at a chromosome 21 marker with alleles (M1, M2) and the father is heterozygous with alleles (P1, P2). The child with Down syndrome is found to have three alleles at this locus: M1, P1, and P2.\n\nFirst, identify the parent of origin of the extra chromosome. The child carries two distinct paternal alleles, P1 and P2, but only one maternal allele, M1. Therefore, the extra chromosome 21 must be paternal in origin; the fertilizing sperm was disomic (carried two copies of chromosome 21), and the oocyte contributed a single maternal copy carrying M1.\n\nSecond, determine the meiotic stage in which nondisjunction occurred in the father. The key principle is:\n- Meiosis I nondisjunction leads to both homologous chromosomes segregating to the same gamete. At a heterozygous locus on those homologs, this produces heterodisomy: the gamete carries two different alleles (here P1 and P2).\n- Meiosis II nondisjunction leads to sister chromatids failing to separate. In the absence of recombination between the locus and the centromere, the sister chromatids are identical at the locus, producing isodisomy: the gamete would carry two copies of the same paternal allele (e.g., P1 and P1 or P2 and P2).\n\nBecause the child has two distinct paternal alleles, P1 and P2, this pattern is diagnostic of paternal meiosis I nondisjunction (heterodisomy), not meiosis II nondisjunction (which would yield isodisomy at this locus). Therefore, nondisjunction occurred in the father during meiosis I.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2286463"}, {"introduction": "Modern genetics has moved beyond the microscope to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities, now employing powerful tools like whole-genome sequencing.

It is known that the sample either exhibits 50% mosaicism for trisomy 13 or is uniformly triploid.\n- A sample with 50% mosaicism for trisomy 13 consists of two cell populations in equal proportion: 50% of the cells are normal diploid (2n), and 50% of the cells are aneuploid with an extra copy of chromosome 13 (2n+1).\n- A uniformly triploid sample (3n) consists of cells that all have three copies of every chromosome.\n\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, the bioinformatician plans to calculate a specific metric from the sequencing data. Your task is to determine the theoretical value of this metric for the mosaic sample.\n\nCalculate the expected ratio of the average sequencing read depth of chromosome 13 to the average sequencing read depth of an unaffected autosome (for instance, chromosome 14).
