This exercise walks you through a classic two-generation cross, starting with true-breeding parents for two different traits. By determining the genotypes of the F1 generation and then calculating the phenotypic outcomes of the F2 generation, you will build a foundational understanding of how alleles for unlinked genes are inherited independently, leading to the famous $9:3:3:1$ phenotypic ratio. [@problem_id:2320382]", "problem": "In a study of the genetics of a fictional flowering plant, *Aeridoglossum magnificum*, two unlinked genes are being investigated. The first gene controls petal color, where the dominant allele $P$ codes for purple petals and the recessive allele $p$ codes for white petals. The second gene controls stamen length, where the dominant allele $L$ codes for long stamens and the recessive allele $l$ codes for short stamens.\n\nA geneticist starts with two true-breeding parental lines. One line has purple petals and short stamens, and the other has white petals and long stamens. The geneticist crosses these two parental lines to produce an F1 generation. Subsequently, an F1 individual is self-fertilized to produce an F2 generation.\n\nAssuming independent assortment of these two genes, what is the expected fraction of the F2 generation plants that will exhibit white petals and short stamens? Express your answer as a single fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected proportion of F2 offspring with the phenotype of white petals and short stamens. To find this, we must first determine the genotypes of the parental (P), F1, and F2 generations.\n\nFirst, let's establish the genotypes of the true-breeding parental plants.\nThe parent with purple petals and short stamens is described as true-breeding. Since purple ($P$) is dominant and short ($l$) is recessive, its genotype must be homozygous for both traits, which is $PPll$.\nThe parent with white petals and long stamens is also true-breeding. Since white ($p$) is recessive and long ($L$) is dominant, its genotype must be $ppLL$.\n\nNext, we determine the genotype of the F1 generation resulting from the cross of these two parents: $PPll$ $\\times$ $ppLL$.\nThe $PPll$ parent can only produce gametes with the alleles $Pl$.\nThe $ppLL$ parent can only produce gametes with the alleles $pL$.\nFertilization combines these gametes, so all offspring in the F1 generation will have the genotype $PpLl$.\n\nThe phenotype of the F1 generation ($PpLl$) will be purple petals and long stamens, as both $P$ and $L$ are dominant alleles.\n\nNow, we consider the self-fertilization of an F1 individual ($PpLl$ $\\times$ $PpLl$) to produce the F2 generation.\nAn individual with genotype $PpLl$ can produce four types of gametes. Due to the law of independent assortment, the alleles for the two genes are sorted into gametes independently. The possible gamete combinations are $PL$, $Pl$, $pL$, and $pl$. Each of these gametes is produced with equal probability, i.e., a frequency of $1/4$.\n\nTo find the proportion of the F2 generation with the phenotype of white petals and short stamens, we can use two methods: a Punnett square or probability calculations.\n\nMethod 1: Using probability.\nThe phenotype \"white petals\" corresponds to the recessive genotype $pp$. The probability of obtaining a $pp$ genotype from a $Pp \\times Pp$ cross is $1/4$.\nThe phenotype \"short stamens\" corresponds to the recessive genotype $ll$. The probability of obtaining an $ll$ genotype from an $Ll \\times Ll$ cross is $1/4$.\nSince the two genes assort independently, the probability of an F2 offspring having both recessive phenotypes (genotype $ppll$) is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ P(ppll) = P(pp) \\times P(ll) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16} $$\n\nMethod 2: Using a Punnett square.\nWe can set up a 4x4 Punnett square for the $PpLl \\times PpLl$ cross. The rows and columns are labeled with the four possible gamete types: $PL$, $Pl$, $pL$, $pl$.\n\n| | **PL** | **Pl** | **pL** | **pl** |\n| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |\n| **PL** | PPLL | PPLl | PpLL | PpLl |\n| **Pl** | PPLl | PPll | PpLl | Ppll |\n| **pL** | PpLL | PpLl | ppLL | ppLl |\n| **pl** | PpLl | Ppll | ppLl | **ppll** |\n\nThe desired phenotype is white petals (genotype $pp$) and short stamens (genotype $ll$). The only genotype that produces this phenotype is $ppll$.\nBy inspecting the 16 possible genotypes in the Punnett square, we find that the $ppll$ genotype occurs only once.\nTherefore, the expected proportion of F2 offspring with white petals and short stamens is 1 out of 16, or $1/16$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The fraction of the F2 generation expected to have white petals and short stamens is $1/16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$$", "id": "2320382"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting outcomes, geneticists often need to deduce the genetic makeup of an organism. This practice introduces a powerful experimental tool known as the test cross, where an individual of unknown genotype is crossed with one that is homozygous recessive for the traits of interest.

These two genes are located on different non-homologous chromosomes and thus assort independently.\n\nA researcher conducts a test cross.
