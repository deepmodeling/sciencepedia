This exercise [@problem_id:2302801] walks you through the foundational steps of crossing true-breeding parents to observe the predictable patterns of inheritance in the F1 and F2 generations. By calculating the expected phenotypic fractions, you will solidify your understanding of dominance, recessiveness, and the fundamental law of segregation.", "problem": "A student in a genetics lab is studying inheritance in the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*. One of the traits of interest is the presence of leaf hairs, known as trichomes. The common wild-type phenotype exhibits hairy leaves, whereas a known mutant phenotype, called 'glabrous', results in smooth, hairless leaves. It has been previously established that this trait is determined by a single gene, with the glabrous allele being recessive to the wild-type allele.\n\nThe student performs a monohybrid cross, starting with a parental (P) generation. They cross a true-breeding wild-type plant with a true-breeding glabrous plant. The resulting seeds are grown to produce the first filial (F1) generation. These F1 plants are then allowed to self-pollinate to produce the second filial (F2) generation.\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance, what is the expected fraction of plants showing the wild-type (hairy) phenotype in the F1 generation, and what is the expected fraction of plants showing the wild-type phenotype in the F2 generation?\n\nExpress your final answer as two decimal numbers representing the fractions for the F1 and F2 generations, respectively.", "solution": "Let $H$ denote the dominant allele for the wild-type (hairy) phenotype and $h$ denote the recessive allele for the glabrous phenotype. A true-breeding wild-type plant has genotype $HH$, and a true-breeding glabrous plant has genotype $hh$.\n\nIn the P cross $HH \\times hh$, the $HH$ parent produces only $H$ gametes and the $hh$ parent produces only $h$ gametes. Therefore, all F1 offspring are $Hh$. Since $H$ is dominant to $h$, the phenotype of all $Hh$ plants is wild-type (hairy). Thus, the expected fraction of wild-type plants in F1 is\n$$\n1.00.\n$$\n\nFor the F2 generation, F1 plants self-pollinate: $Hh \\times Hh$. Each $Hh$ parent produces gametes $H$ and $h$ with probabilities $\\frac{1}{2}$ each. The zygote genotype probabilities are\n$$\nP(HH)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cdot\\tfrac{1}{2}=\\tfrac{1}{4},\\quad\nP(Hh)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cdot\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cdot\\tfrac{1}{2}=\\tfrac{1}{2},\\quad\nP(hh)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cdot\\tfrac{1}{2}=\\tfrac{1}{4}.\n$$\nPhenotypically, $HH$ and $Hh$ are wild-type, while $hh$ is glabrous, so the expected fraction of wild-type plants in F2 is\n$$\n\\tfrac{1}{4}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=\\tfrac{3}{4}=0.75.\n$$\nTherefore, the expected fractions of wild-type (hairy) phenotype are $1.00$ in F1 and $0.75$ in F2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1.00 & 0.75\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2302801"}, {"introduction": "While the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross famously yields a $3:1$ phenotypic ratio, the underlying genotypic ratio is $1:2:1$.

The second gene, which assorts independently from the leaf color gene, controls the production of a cryoprotectant protein. The allele for protein production ($C$), which confers frost resistance, is dominant over the allele for no protein production ($c$).\n\nHowever, there is a complication: the homozygous dominant genotype for cryoprotectant production ($CC$) is lethal early in embryonic development, and any seed with this genotype will fail to germinate.\n\nA researcher performs a cross between two *Vallesia paradoxa* plants, both of which have red leaves and are frost-resistant.
