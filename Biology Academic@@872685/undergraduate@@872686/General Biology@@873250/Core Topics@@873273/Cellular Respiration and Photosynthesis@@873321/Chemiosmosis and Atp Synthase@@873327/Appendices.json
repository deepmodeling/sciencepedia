Under these conditions, the mitochondria are actively respiring and producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nAn investigator then introduces oligomycin, an antibiotic that specifically binds to the $F_O$ subunit of the ATP synthase complex, effectively blocking its proton channel. Assuming the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) remains initially unaffected, which of the following outcomes is the most immediate and direct consequence of adding oligomycin to the mitochondrial suspension?\n\nA. The rate of ATP synthesis will decrease, and the magnitude of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane will decrease.\n\nB.

Both the rate of ATP synthesis and the magnitude of the proton gradient will remain unaffected because the ETC is still functional.", "solution": "Under actively respiring conditions with abundant ADP, $P_i$, substrate, and $O_2$, the electron transport chain (ETC) pumps protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a proton motive force $\\Delta p$ across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The proton motive force is given by\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{H}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{H}^{+}]_{\\text{out}}}\\right),\n$$\nand drives protons back into the matrix primarily through the $F_O F_1$ ATP synthase.

This practice moves from the concept of coupling to the specific structural features that make it possible. By analyzing a mutation in the proton-binding site of the F₀ motor, you can connect the chemical properties of a single amino acid to the grand function of proton translocation and energy conversion [@problem_id:2286052].", "problem": "Researchers are investigating the bioenergetics of a thermophilic archaeon isolated from an acidic hot spring. The organism's ATP synthase, the enzyme responsible for synthesizing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), utilizes a proton gradient across its cell membrane. The $F_O$ component of this synthase contains a ring of 'c' subunits that rotates as protons move through it. In the wild-type enzyme, a specific aspartate residue (an amino acid with a carboxylate side chain) on each c-subunit is crucial for this process. A proton from the high-concentration side (periplasm) binds to the deprotonated carboxylate group of this aspartate. This binding neutralizes the charge and allows the c-ring to rotate into the hydrophobic lipid bilayer. After a nearly full rotation, the subunit is exposed to the low-concentration side (cytoplasm), where the higher pH causes the proton to dissociate, completing the transport cycle and driving the synthesis of ATP by the $F_1$ component.\n\nThe researchers generate a mutant strain in which the gene for the c-subunit is altered, replacing the critical aspartate residue with an alanine residue. Alanine is a small amino acid with a neutral, nonpolar methyl group as its side chain. The mutated ATP synthase is correctly assembled and inserted into the cell membrane.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary consequence of this mutation on the function of the ATP synthase complex, assuming a normal proton gradient is maintained by the cell's respiratory chain?\n\nA. ATP synthesis will halt, but protons will flow freely and uncontrollably through the mutated F_0 component, dissipating the proton gradient.\n\nB. Both proton translocation through the F_0 component and ATP synthesis by the F_1 component will be severely inhibited or completely stopped.\n\nC. The rate of ATP synthesis will significantly increase because the smaller alanine residue allows the c-ring to rotate more freely.\n\nD. Proton translocation will proceed normally, but the conformational change will no longer be coupled to ATP synthesis in the F_1 component, resulting in no ATP production.\n\nE. The direction of the enzyme will be reversed, causing it to function exclusively as an ATP-powered proton pump, hydrolyzing ATP to pump protons out of the cytoplasm.", "solution": "In the wild-type $F_O F_1$-ATP synthase, proton translocation through $F_O$ is coupled to rotation of the $c$-ring and to ATP synthesis by $F_1$. The energetic driver is the proton motive force, an electrochemical potential difference for $\\text{H}^{+}$, which can be expressed symbolically as $\\Delta\\mu_{\\text{H}^{+}}$. The fundamental energetic coupling condition is that, per catalytic turnover, the work done by proton translocation equals the free energy requirement of ATP synthesis:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{H}}\\,\\Delta\\mu_{\\text{H}^{+}} \\approx \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ATP}},\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is the number of protons translocated per ATP synthesized. Mechanical coupling implies power balance $P_{\\text{in}}=P_{\\text{out}}$, with $P_{\\text{in}}=J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}\\Delta\\mu_{\\text{H}^{+}}$ and $P_{\\text{out}}=\\tau \\omega$, where $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is the proton flux through $F_O$, $\\tau$ is the torque on the rotor, and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity.\n\nProton translocation in $F_O$ requires a protonatable carboxylate on each $c$-subunit (an aspartate or glutamate). The cycle is:\n- On the high-$\\text{H}^{+}$ side, a deprotonated carboxylate $\\text{COO}^{-}$ binds $\\text{H}^{+}$ to form neutral $\\mathrm{COOH}$. Charge neutralization is essential to allow burial in the hydrophobic lipid, lowering the energetic barrier for rotation.\n- Rotation carries the protonated site to the low-$\\text{H}^{+}$ side, where the higher pH favors deprotonation, regenerating $\\text{COO}^{-}$ and releasing $\\text{H}^{+}$.\n- This gated binding/release across two half-channels in the $a$-subunit enables net translocation of $\\text{H}^{+}$ and drives rotation.\n\nMathematically, the capacity of $F_O$ to carry proton flux can be represented as\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = G_{F_O}\\,\\Delta\\mu_{\\text{H}^{+}},\n$$\nwhere $G_{F_O}$ is an effective conductance that depends critically on the presence of the protonatable carboxylate; without a binding site and charge neutralization, the hydrophobic barrier prevents passage, so $G_{F_O}\\to 0$ and thus $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}\\to 0$ even if $\\Delta\\mu_{\\text{H}^{+}}$ is maintained.\n\nIn the mutant where the essential aspartate is replaced by alanine, the $c$-subunit lacks the carboxylate side chain. Consequences follow directly:\n- There is no $\\text{COO}^{-}/\\mathrm{COOH}$ group to bind and carry $\\text{H}^{+}$. The neutral methyl side chain cannot participate in the protonation-deprotonation cycle.\n- Without proton binding and charge neutralization, the rotor cannot move a proton through the hydrophobic phase; the translocation pathway is broken. Therefore $G_{F_O} \\approx 0$ and $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\approx 0$.\n- With $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} \\approx 0$, the input power $P_{\\text{in}}=J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}\\Delta\\mu_{\\text{H}^{+}} \\approx 0$, so $\\tau \\omega \\approx 0$. In steady state this implies $\\omega \\approx 0$ for the coupled rotor, so the rate of ATP synthesis by $F_1$, which depends on rotation, is severely inhibited or stops.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A (uncontrolled proton leak) would require formation of a continuous pore. Replacing a carboxylate with a neutral alanine removes the binding site and the gating mechanism; it does not create an open channel. The expected effect is decreased, not increased, proton conductance, so A is incorrect.\n- Option B states both proton translocation and ATP synthesis are severely inhibited or stopped. This follows from $G_{F_O}\\to 0$, giving $J_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}\\to 0$ and thus no torque to drive $F_1$, so B is correct.\n- Option C (increased ATP synthesis due to smaller residue) ignores the essential chemistry of proton binding; steric reduction cannot compensate for loss of the proton carrier, so C is incorrect.\n- Option D (normal proton translocation but uncoupled) contradicts the mechanical coupling of $F_O$ and $F_1$; furthermore, proton translocation itself fails without the carboxylate, so D is incorrect.\n- Option E (exclusive reversal as ATP-driven pump) requires a functional proton path through $F_O$ to pump protons. Without the carboxylate, proton conduction in either direction is impaired, so E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is loss of proton translocation through $F_O$ and consequent loss of ATP synthesis by $F_1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2286052"}, {"introduction": "To truly appreciate the power of ATP synthase, we must quantify the forces it works with and against.
