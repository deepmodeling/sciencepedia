To begin characterizing its properties, a researcher prepares a solution of the purified pigment and analyzes it using a spectrophotometer, an instrument that measures how much light a substance absorbs at different wavelengths. The experiment is conducted using a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm, and the results for absorbance across the visible spectrum are recorded.\n\nThe data from the spectrophotometer are as follows:\n\n| Wavelength (nm) | Region of Visible Spectrum | Absorbance (unitless) |\n|:---------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|\n| 430             | Violet                     | 0.15                  |\n| 470             | Blue                       | 0.05                  |\n| 520             | Green                      | 0.10                  |\n| 580             | Yellow                     | 0.50                  |\n| 610             | Orange                     | 0.95                  |\n| 660             | Red                        | 0.70                  |\n\nBased on this absorption spectrum data, what is the apparent color of the maricyanin solution when it is illuminated by white light?\n\nA.

This practice moves from simple absorption to biological function by exploring the concept of an action spectrum, which measures the rate of photosynthesis at different wavelengths. By comparing the photosynthetic output of a plant under different colored lights, you can deduce which wavelengths its pigments absorb most effectively to power life. [@problem_id:2321610]", "problem": "An undergraduate biology student is conducting an experiment to investigate the photosynthetic activity of an aquatic plant, *Elodea*. The student places two identical sprigs of *Elodea* into separate beakers filled with a bicarbonate solution, which provides a source of carbon dioxide. Each setup is illuminated with a light source of equal intensity. However, one setup is covered with a filter that transmits only blue light (wavelength approximately 470 nm), while the other is covered with a filter that transmits only green light (wavelength approximately 540 nm).

Oxygen bubbles in this setup are a proxy for the rate of the light-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis; thus, a higher bubble rate indicates a higher photosynthetic rate.\n\nPhysical principle relating photon energy to wavelength:\n$$\nE = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda},\n$$\nwhere $E$ is energy per photon, $h$ is Planck’s constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength. Since $\\lambda_{\\text{blue}}<\\lambda_{\\text{green}}$, it follows that $E_{\\text{blue}}>E_{\\text{green}}$.\n\nFor equal light intensity $I$ (power per unit area), the incident photon flux $\\Phi$ (photons per unit area per unit time) satisfies\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{I}{E} = \\frac{I\\lambda}{hc}.\n$$\nTherefore, with equal $I$, we have $\\Phi_{\\text{blue}}<\\Phi_{\\text{green}}$, because $\\lambda_{\\text{blue}}<\\lambda_{\\text{green}}$.\n\nDespite the lower photon flux under blue light, the plant exhibits a higher photosynthetic rate under blue light than under green light. This implies that the photosynthetic apparatus absorbs and utilizes blue photons more effectively than green photons. This is consistent with the known absorption spectra of chlorophylls and accessory pigments in green plants: they absorb strongly in the blue and red regions and weakly in the green region (which is largely reflected/transmitted, giving plants their green appearance).\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n- A claims maximal absorption of green and reflection of blue. This contradicts both the observation (lower photosynthesis under green) and the known absorption spectra of chlorophylls. Reject A.\n\n- B claims pigments reflect all visible wavelengths and rely on chemical energy. This is incompatible with the requirement that light energy must be absorbed to drive the light reactions of photosynthesis. Reject B.\n\n- C claims green photons have higher energy than blue, causing photoinhibition. From $E=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, this is false; blue photons have higher energy. Moreover, the data do not show photoinhibition under blue compared to green. Reject C.\n\n- D states that the pigments absorb blue light more effectively than green light and use the absorbed energy to drive photosynthesis. This directly explains the observed higher oxygen evolution under blue than green and aligns with established pigment absorption properties. Accept D.\n\n- E posits a unique pigment different from chlorophyll with a specialized blue peak. The observation is fully explained by the standard chlorophyll a and b absorption in the blue; no unique pigment is required.

The leaves of this plant contain two primary pigment groups: a chlorophyll complex (Chl) and a carotenoid complex (Car). To model the leaf's interaction with light, the botanist assumes that incident sunlight has uniform intensity across the visible spectrum. The fraction of light absorbed by the leaf at a specific wavelength, $A_{\\lambda}$, is determined by the relative concentrations and absorptivities of the pigments according to the formula:\n\n$$A_{\\lambda} = \\frac{C_{Chl} \\cdot a_{Chl, \\lambda} + C_{Car} \\cdot a_{Car, \\lambda}}{C_{Chl} + C_{Car}}$$\n\nHere, $C_{Chl}$ and $C_{Car}$ are the relative concentrations of the chlorophyll and carotenoid complexes, respectively. The terms $a_{Chl, \\lambda}$ and $a_{Car, \\lambda}$ are the specific absorptivities of each pigment complex at wavelength $\\lambda$.\n\nIn a healthy, wild-type leaf, the relative concentrations are $C_{Chl} = 4.0$ arbitrary units and $C_{Car} = 1.0$ arbitrary unit. The specific absorptivities (a dimensionless measure) at representative wavelengths for green (550 nm) and red (650 nm) light are provided as follows:\n- For the Chlorophyll complex (Chl): $a_{Chl, Green} = 0.10$ and $a_{Chl, Red} = 0.85$.\n- For the Carotenoid complex (Car): $a_{Car, Green} = 0.40$ and $a_{Car, Red} = 0.05$.\n\nThe perceived color of the leaf depends on the light it reflects. The intensity of reflected light at a given wavelength, $I_{refl, \\lambda}$, is proportional to $(1 - A_{\\lambda})$. A useful metric for the \"greenness\" of the leaf is the ratio of reflected green light intensity to reflected red light intensity, defined as $R = \\frac{I_{refl, Green}}{I_{refl, Red}}$.\n\nA genetic mutation is introduced that completely eliminates the production of the carotenoid complex, setting its concentration $C_{Car}$ to zero.
