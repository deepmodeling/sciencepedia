The experiment involves monitoring key components of the mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain (ETC), the primary pathway for cellular energy production. The ETC involves a series of protein complexes and mobile electron carriers that transfer electrons from donors like NADH and FADH2 to a final electron acceptor, oxygen. Two critical mobile carriers in this chain are coenzyme Q (also known as ubiquinone) and cytochrome c.\n\nAt a specific point in the experiment, a potent metabolic inhibitor, cyanide, is introduced into the cell culture medium. Cyanide is known to bind irreversibly to one of the components of the ETC. Assume that the cells were in a state of active oxidative phosphorylation with ample supply of electron donors (NADH, FADH2) and oxygen just before the addition of the inhibitor.\n\nWhat is the immediate effect of the addition of cyanide on the redox state of the majority of molecules in the coenzyme Q pool and the cytochrome c pool?\n\nA. Coenzyme Q becomes more oxidized, and cytochrome c becomes more reduced.\n\nB. Coenzyme Q becomes more reduced, and cytochrome c becomes more oxidized.\n\nC. Both coenzyme Q and cytochrome c become more oxidized.\n\nD. Both coenzyme Q and cytochrome c become more reduced.\n\nE. The redox states of both pools remain unchanged as the block is downstream of both.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the immediate change in the redox states of coenzyme Q and cytochrome c upon the addition of cyanide to actively respiring cells. To solve this, we must first understand the sequence of electron flow in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and the specific site of action of cyanide.\n\nStep 1: The standard flow of electrons in the ETC.\nElectrons from NADH enter the ETC at Complex I, and electrons from FADH2 enter at Complex II. Both Complex I and Complex II transfer their electrons to a mobile lipid-soluble carrier called coenzyme Q (ubiquinone). When coenzyme Q accepts electrons, it is reduced to ubiquinol. Reduced coenzyme Q then moves to Complex III and donates its electrons. Complex III, in turn, transfers these electrons to another mobile carrier, cytochrome c. When cytochrome c accepts an electron, it becomes reduced. Reduced cytochrome c then shuttles the electron to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). Finally, Complex IV catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to the final electron acceptor, molecular oxygen ($O_2$), which is reduced to form water ($H_2O$).\n\nThe simplified sequence of electron flow concerning the components in question is:\nElectron Donors (NADH/FADH2) $\\rightarrow$ Complex I/II $\\rightarrow$ Coenzyme Q $\\rightarrow$ Complex III $\\rightarrow$ Cytochrome c $\\rightarrow$ Complex IV $\\rightarrow$ Oxygen\n\nStep 2: Identify the site of action of cyanide.\nCyanide is a well-known inhibitor of cellular respiration. Specifically, it binds to the iron atom in the heme group of cytochrome a3, which is a component of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). This binding prevents Complex IV from transferring electrons to oxygen. Thus, cyanide effectively blocks the ETC at its very last step.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the effect of the block on cytochrome c.\nSince Complex IV is inhibited, it can no longer accept electrons from cytochrome c. However, upstream components (like Complex III) are still trying to pass electrons *to* cytochrome c. This means that cytochrome c molecules will accept electrons but will be unable to pass them on. As a result, the pool of cytochrome c molecules will rapidly accumulate in their reduced state. Therefore, cytochrome c becomes more reduced.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the effect of the block on coenzyme Q.\nThe blockage at Complex IV creates a \"traffic jam\" that propagates backward up the chain. Since cytochrome c is stuck in its reduced state, it cannot accept any more electrons from Complex III. This causes the components of Complex III to remain in their reduced state because they cannot offload their electrons. Consequently, a reduced Complex III cannot accept electrons from coenzyme Q. Coenzyme Q receives electrons from Complexes I and II but is now unable to pass them to Complex III. This inability to be oxidized causes the entire pool of coenzyme Q to accumulate in its reduced form (ubiquinol). Therefore, coenzyme Q also becomes more reduced.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the overall effect.\nThe inhibition of Complex IV by cyanide leads to a backup of electrons throughout the entire chain upstream of the block. Both cytochrome c (immediately upstream) and coenzyme Q (further upstream) become saturated with electrons and accumulate in their reduced states.\n\nBased on this reasoning, both coenzyme Q and cytochrome c become more reduced.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution. It is objective and free of ambiguity. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed with Solution**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the net ATP yield per molecule of cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}$ when electrons are transferred via the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle. This calculation is based on the chemiosmotic principle, which links the proton motive force to ATP synthesis. The solution is found by first calculating the number of protons pumped per cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}$ and then dividing by the number of protons required to synthesize and transport one molecule of ATP.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of protons, $N_{\\text{pumped}}$, translocated from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space for each pair of electrons originating from one molecule of cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}$. The glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle transfers these electrons to the ETC at the level of ubiquinone ($\\mathrm{Q}$), forming ubiquinol ($\\mathrm{QH_2}$). This process bypasses Complex I. The electrons then proceed through Complex III and Complex IV. Based on the provided stoichiometry:\n- Complex III pumps $4$ protons per pair of electrons.\n- Complex IV pumps $2$ protons per pair of electrons.\n\nThe total number of protons pumped, $N_{\\text{pumped}}$, is the sum of the protons translocated by these two complexes.\n$$\nN_{\\text{pumped}} = 4 + 2 = 6\n$$\nTherefore, the oxidation of one molecule of cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}$ via this shuttle results in the translocation of $6$ protons.\n\nSecond, we determine the total proton cost, $N_{\\text{cost}}$, for producing one molecule of ATP that is available in the cytosol. This cost has two components: the cost of synthesis by ATP synthase and the cost of transporting substrates.\nThe ATP synthase requires the translocation of $n_c$ protons for the synthesis of $3$ ATP molecules. Given $n_c = 8$, the number of protons required for the synthesis of one ATP molecule, $N_{\\text{synth}}$, is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{synth}} = \\frac{n_c}{3} = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\nIn addition to synthesis, the import of one molecule of inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$), which is a substrate for ATP synthesis, costs $1$ proton. This is the transport cost, $N_{\\text{transport}}$.\n$$\nN_{\\text{transport}} = 1\n$$\nThe problem states to ignore the energetic cost of the adenine nucleotide translocase in the proton count. The total proton cost per net ATP, $N_{\\text{cost}}$, is the sum of the synthesis and transport costs.\n$$\nN_{\\text{cost}} = N_{\\text{synth}} + N_{\\text{transport}} = \\frac{8}{3} + 1 = \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{11}{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, the net ATP yield per cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}$ is the ratio of the total number of protons pumped to the total proton cost per ATP.\n$$\n\\text{ATP Yield} = \\frac{N_{\\text{pumped}}}{N_{\\text{cost}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\text{ATP Yield} = \\frac{6}{\\frac{11}{3}} = 6 \\times \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{18}{11}\n$$\nThis result is dimensionless, representing the number of ATP molecules per molecule of cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{18}{11}}$$", "id": "2615689"}]}
