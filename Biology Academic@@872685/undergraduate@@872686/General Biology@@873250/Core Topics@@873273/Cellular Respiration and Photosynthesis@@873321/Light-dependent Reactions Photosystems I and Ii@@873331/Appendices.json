The experimental setup is then illuminated with light of a wavelength and intensity optimal for the light-dependent reactions.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately predicts the outcome within these mutant chloroplasts shortly after illumination begins?\n\nA. Both oxygen (O₂) and NADPH will be produced at a steady, continuous rate, but no Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) will be synthesized.\n\nB.

O₂ and NADPH will be produced initially, but their production will quickly cease as an extreme proton gradient builds up across the thylakoid membrane.\n\nE. NADPH will be produced, but O₂ will not be produced, because only cyclic electron flow will be active.", "solution": "We consider the light reactions of photosynthesis in isolated chloroplasts with a non-functional ATP synthase. Upon illumination, Photosystem II (PSII) absorbs photons and oxidizes water, releasing electrons, protons into the thylakoid lumen, and molecular oxygen. The overall PSII water-splitting reaction is\n$$\n2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{O}_2 + 4\\text{H}^+_{\\text{lumen}} + 4e^-\n$$\nThese electrons pass through the electron transport chain: from PSII to plastoquinone (PQ), then to cytochrome b6f, plastocyanin, Photosystem I (PSI), ferredoxin, and finally reduce $\\text{NADP}^{+}$ to $\\text{NADPH}$ via ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR):\n$$\n\\text{NADP}^+ + 2e^{-} + \\text{H}^+_{\\text{stroma}} \\rightarrow \\text{NADPH}\n$$\nAs electrons flow, protons are translocated into the lumen by two mechanisms: (i) release of $\\text{H}^{+}$ during water oxidation at PSII and (ii) the Q-cycle at cytochrome b6f, which effectively transfers additional protons from the stroma to the lumen. This builds a proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane, composed predominantly of a transmembrane pH gradient.\n\nNormally, ATP synthase dissipates this proton motive force by allowing $\\text{H}^{+}$ to flow back to the stroma, coupling the free energy of $\\text{H}^{+}$ movement to ATP synthesis:\n$$\n\\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_i \\xrightarrow[\\text{driven by } \\Delta p]{\\text{ATP synthase}} \\text{ATP}\n$$\nIn the mutant, ATP synthase is completely non-functional, so the proton flux through ATP synthase is zero.

As $\\Delta p$ grows, the energetic cost of further proton pumping increases. When $\\Delta G_{\\text{pump}}$ approaches the available redox free energy drop across the chain, electron transfer through cytochrome b6f and associated steps becomes unfavorable and slows or stalls. Additionally, lumen acidification triggers feedback inhibition (e.g., slowing of the Q-cycle at cytochrome b6f and energy-dependent non-photochemical quenching) that further suppresses electron flow.\n\nTherefore, immediately after illumination begins, electrons will flow, leading to production of $\\text{O}_2$ at PSII and reduction of $\\text{NADP}^+$ to $\\text{NADPH}$ at PSI/FNR. However, because ATP synthase cannot dissipate the proton gradient, an extreme $\\Delta p$ rapidly builds up, quickly suppressing further electron transport. As a result, both $\\text{O}_2$ and $\\text{NADPH}$ are produced initially but their production soon ceases. Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because production would not continue steadily; it would stall as $\\Delta p$ rises.\n- B is incorrect because the chain is not immediately inhibited; it runs briefly before stalling.\n- C is incorrect because electrons proceed beyond PSII initially, allowing $\\text{NADPH}$ formation.\n- D is correct: initial production of $\\text{O}_2$ and $\\text{NADPH}$ followed by rapid cessation due to an extreme proton gradient.\n- E is incorrect because PSII is active initially, so $\\text{O}_2$ is produced; cyclic flow would also be impeded as $\\Delta p$ builds without dissipation.\n\nThus the accurate prediction is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2300603"}, {"introduction": "The entire process of photosynthesis is initiated by a single, incredibly rapid event: the transfer of an energized electron.
