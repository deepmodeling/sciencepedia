This bacterium's cell membrane contains the machinery for cellular respiration, including an Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and an ATP synthase complex. In an in-vitro experiment, the student prepares a solution containing the bacterium's isolated cell membranes, a surplus of NADH as an electron donor, ADP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and a controlled supply of dissolved oxygen. Initially, the system is observed to have a steady rate of both oxygen consumption and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.\n\nThe student then introduces Compound Q, a synthetic lipophilic molecule. Compound Q is a weak acid that can readily diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the membranes. It has the property of binding a proton (H+) on the side of the membrane with high proton concentration, diffusing to the other side, and releasing the proton where the concentration is low.\n\nImmediately after the addition of Compound Q to the experimental setup, what would be the most likely effects on the rates of oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis?\n\nA. The rate of oxygen consumption will decrease, and the rate of ATP synthesis will decrease.\n\nB. The rate of oxygen consumption will increase, and the rate of ATP synthesis will increase.\n\nC. The rate of oxygen consumption will decrease, and the rate of ATP synthesis will increase.\n\nD. The rate of oxygen consumption will increase, and the rate of ATP synthesis will decrease.\n\nE. The rate of oxygen consumption will not change, but the rate of ATP synthesis will decrease.", "solution": "We identify Compound Q as a protonophore (an uncoupler): a weak acid that carries protons across the membrane from the side of high proton concentration to the side of low proton concentration, thereby increasing the proton conductance of the membrane and dissipating the proton gradient.\n\nIn oxidative phosphorylation, the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) pumps protons across the membrane, generating a proton motive force given by\n$$\n\\Delta p=\\Delta \\psi - \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[H^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}{[H^{+}]_{\\text{out}}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\psi$ is the transmembrane electrical potential, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. The free energy available per proton moving down the gradient is $F\\Delta p$. ATP synthase uses the energy from the re-entry of $n$ protons to drive ATP synthesis, requiring\n$$\nnF\\Delta p \\ge \\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}},\n$$\nso the rate of ATP synthesis, $J_{\\text{ATP}}$, is an increasing function of $\\Delta p$ and falls when $\\Delta p$ is reduced.\n\nLet $J_{\\text{ETC}}(\\Delta p)$ denote the rate of proton pumping by the ETC. Due to back-pressure from the proton motive force, $J_{\\text{ETC}}$ decreases as $\\Delta p$ increases and approaches a maximal value as $\\Delta p \\to 0$. At steady state, the proton flux balance is\n$$\nJ_{\\text{ETC}}(\\Delta p) = J_{\\text{ATP}}(\\Delta p) + J_{\\text{leak}}(\\Delta p),\n$$\nwhere $J_{\\text{leak}}$ is the proton leak across the membrane.

Therefore, the immediate effects of adding Compound Q are an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption and a decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis.\n\nHence, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2323138"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the biochemical pathways is one thing, but quantifying their output is what truly reveals their physiological significance.

One of the most striking examples is muscle contraction, where ATP drives mechanical work. This thought experiment uses a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog to dissect the molecular steps of the cross-bridge cycle, revealing that the mere act of ATP binding—not just its hydrolysis—plays a critical and distinct mechanical role in powering our movements [@problem_id:2323125].", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying the mechanism of muscle contraction using an isolated skeletal muscle fiber. The fiber is placed in a solution that allows it to contract when stimulated. The molecular process of muscle contraction, known as the cross-bridge cycle, involves the interaction between myosin heads and actin filaments. This cycle can be summarized by the following key events:\n\n1.  **Cross-bridge formation:** A myosin head, energized by a previous cycle, binds to an actin filament.\n2.  **Power stroke:** The myosin head pivots, pulling the actin filament towards the center of the sarcomere. ADP and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) are released from the myosin head.\n3.  **Cross-bridge detachment:** A new molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from the actin filament.\n4.  **Reactivation:** The ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and $P_i$, and the energy released is used to \"re-cock\" the myosin head into its high-energy conformation, preparing it for the next cycle.\n\nThe biologist then microinjects a high concentration of a specific molecule, $\\gamma$-imidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMP-PNP), into the muscle fiber while it is actively contracting. AMP-PNP is a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, meaning it can bind to the ATP-binding site on the myosin head but cannot be broken down into ADP and $P_i$.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately predicts the immediate effect of this microinjection on the muscle fiber?\n\nA. The myosin heads will become permanently locked to the actin filaments, causing the muscle fiber to enter a state of extreme rigidity (a rigor state).\n\nB. The myosin heads will detach from the actin filaments and be unable to re-bind, causing the muscle fiber to relax and lose its ability to generate tension.\n\nC. The cross-bridge cycle will continue, but at a much slower rate, resulting in a sustained, weak contraction.\n\nD.
