The experiment is conducted under constant optimal conditions of temperature and pH, with a fixed concentration of isomaltase-X. The researcher systematically increases the concentration of the substrate, isomaltose, and measures the initial reaction rate (the rate of glucose formation).\n\nThe data shows that as the isomaltose concentration increases, the reaction rate also increases. However, after the isomaltose concentration surpasses a certain high level, adding even more isomaltose results in no further increase in the reaction rate. The rate becomes constant, having reached a plateau.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why the reaction rate plateaus?\n\nA. The high concentration of isomaltose causes a change in the enzyme's tertiary structure, leading to its denaturation.\n\nB. The system has reached chemical equilibrium, where the rate of isomaltose hydrolysis is equal to the rate of glucose condensation back into isomaltose.\n\nC. All available cofactors required for isomaltase-X activity have been depleted from the reaction mixture.\n\nD. The active sites of all the isomaltase-X molecules in the solution have become saturated with substrate.\n\nE.

This saturation of active sites is the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the observed plateau.\n\nBy contrast: (A) denaturation is not inherently caused by high $[S]$ and would reduce activity rather than produce a reproducible saturation plateau; (B) initial-rate measurements are made when product is negligible, so reverse reaction does not set the rate; (C) cofactor depletion is not a fundamental, necessary feature of saturation kinetics and would manifest as time dependence rather than a substrate-dependent plateau; (E) product inhibition would decrease the rate below $V_{\\max}$ and depends on product accumulation rather than directly on $[S]$ during initial-rate conditions.
