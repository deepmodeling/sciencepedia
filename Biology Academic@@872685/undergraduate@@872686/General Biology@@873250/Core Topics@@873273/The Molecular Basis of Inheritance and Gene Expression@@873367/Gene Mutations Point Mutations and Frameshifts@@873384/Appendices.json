This practice problem connects the concept of a nonsense mutation to a standard laboratory technique, SDS-PAGE. You will predict how a premature stop codon, which results in a truncated protein, affects its migration on a gel, thereby bridging the gap between a molecular event and its observable experimental outcome.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating a bioluminescent protein named \"Fulgidin\" found in a marine organism. The gene encoding the wild-type (WT) Fulgidin protein has a coding sequence of 1200 base pairs. A non-luminescent mutant strain is discovered. Genetic sequencing of the mutant strain's Fulgidin gene reveals a single nucleotide change at position 451 of the coding sequence. This change is a nonsense mutation, converting a codon for an amino acid into a premature stop codon.\n\nTo analyze the protein products, the researcher expresses and purifies both the WT and the mutant (MT) proteins. Samples of both purified proteins are then loaded into separate lanes on a gel for Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This technique denatures proteins, coats them with a uniform negative charge, and separates them based on their molecular weight as they migrate through the gel matrix under an electric field. Smaller proteins travel further through the gel than larger proteins.\n\nAssuming that both the full-length WT protein and the truncated MT protein are successfully produced and are stable enough to be purified and analyzed, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected result on the SDS-PAGE gel?\n\nA. The band for the MT protein will be located higher on the gel (closer to the loading wells) than the band for the WT protein.\n\nB.

The band for the WT protein will be located higher on the gel (closer to the loading wells) than the band for the MT protein.\n\nD. No protein band will be visible in the lane for the MT protein because a stop codon prevents all translation.\n\nE. Two distinct bands will appear in the lane for the MT protein: one at the same position as the WT protein and one at a lower position.", "solution": "We use the fact that a coding sequence is translated in triplet codons. For the wild-type (WT) gene of length $1200$ base pairs, the number of codons (and hence amino acids in the full-length protein, not counting the terminal stop) is\n$$\nN_{\\text{WT}}=\\frac{1200}{3}=400.\n$$\nThe mutant (MT) has a single nucleotide change at position $451$ that introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation).

Therefore the mutant polypeptide length is\n$$\nN_{\\text{MT}}=151-1=150.\n$$\nUnder SDS-PAGE conditions, SDS denatures proteins and confers an approximately uniform charge-to-mass ratio, so separation is primarily by molecular mass.

Therefore, the WT band (larger protein) will be higher on the gel than the MT band (smaller protein). Given the assumption that both proteins are produced and stable, there will be a single band for each, at different positions, with the WT higher than the MT.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that the band for the WT protein will be located higher on the gel than the band for the MT protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2296654"}, {"introduction": "The genetic code is read in a specific \"reading frame\" of three-nucleotide codons, and disrupting this frame can have catastrophic effects. This exercise explores the logic of frameshift mutations, which are among the most disruptive types of genetic alterations. By analyzing the combined effect of a single nucleotide insertion followed by a single nucleotide deletion, you will see how the reading frame can be both scrambled and subsequently restored, reinforcing the critical importance of the triplet code in protein synthesis.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying a gene that encodes a 300-amino-acid enzyme crucial for a specific metabolic pathway in a bacterium. The original, or wild-type, version of the gene produces a fully functional enzyme.\n\nIn a first experiment, the biologist introduces a mutation by inserting a single guanine (G) nucleotide into the coding strand of the DNA. This insertion occurs immediately after the last nucleotide of codon 49. The resulting mutant strain produces a completely non-functional protein.\n\nIn a second experiment, the biologist takes this non-functional mutant strain and induces a second mutation. This subsequent mutation involves the deletion of a single adenine (A) nucleotide. This deletion occurs at the position corresponding to the first nucleotide of what would have been codon 70 in the original, wild-type sequence.\n\nAnalysis of this new, doubly mutated strain reveals that it produces a full-length protein (300 amino acids long) that exhibits partial, but not complete, enzymatic activity.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the amino acid sequence of the protein produced by the doubly mutated gene, when compared to the wild-type protein?\n\nA. The insertion and deletion perfectly cancel each other out, so the amino acid sequence of the new protein is identical to the wild-type sequence.\n\nB. The amino acid sequence is correct up to amino acid 49, after which the rest of the protein's sequence (amino acids 50-300) is completely different from the wild-type.\n\nC. The amino acid sequence is identical to the wild-type, except for a single incorrect amino acid at position 50 and another at position 70.\n\nD. The amino acid sequence is identical to the wild-type for the first 49 amino acids and for the amino acids from position 70 to 300, but the sequence from amino acid 50 to 69 is completely altered.\n\nE. The combination of mutations results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein that is only 69 amino acids long.", "solution": "Let the wild-type coding sequence consist of nucleotides $b_{1},b_{2},\\dots,b_{900}$ encoding $300$ amino acids. In the wild type, codon $n$ uses nucleotides\n$$\n[3n-2,\\,3n-1,\\,3n].\n$$\nThus codon $49$ uses $[145,146,147]$, codon $50$ uses $[148,149,150]$, and codon $70$ uses $[208,209,210]$.\n\nFirst mutation (insertion of one nucleotide after the last base of codon $49$): a single base is inserted between $b_{147}$ and $b_{148}$. For any original base $b_{i}$ with $i\\geq 148$, its index in the mutated sequence increases by $1$, so its frame class relative to the start codon shifts by\n$$\n\\Delta f \\equiv +1 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\nTherefore, beginning immediately after codon $49$, the reading frame is shifted by $+1$, so amino acids from position $50$ onward are altered, typically leading to loss of function due to missense and often premature termination (consistent with the observed nonfunctional protein).\n\nSecond mutation (deletion of one nucleotide at the position corresponding to the first base of wild-type codon $70$, i.e., original $b_{208}$): remove $b_{208}$. For any original base $b_{i}$ with $i>208$, the net index shift due to the two mutations is\n$$\n(+1)\\;-\\;1 \\;=\\;0,\n$$\nso the frame class downstream of the deletion is restored,\n$$\n\\Delta f \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\nHence, from immediately after the deletion site, the codon partition realigns with the wild-type frame. Between the two mutation sites (from just after $b_{147}$ up to the deletion of $b_{208}$), the frame is shifted by $+1$, so the amino acids encoded in this interval are different from wild type.\n\nTo locate the altered segment in amino acid numbering:\n- Up to codon $49$ (amino acids $1$ to $49$), no nucleotides were changed before their translation, so these amino acids are identical to wild type.\n- The frameshift introduced after $b_{147}$ persists through the region that would encompass wild-type codons $50$ through $69$. Thus amino acids $50$ through $69$ are specified by a shifted reading frame and are different from wild type.\n- The downstream deletion restores the original frame at the site corresponding to the start of wild-type codon $70$, so from that point onward the amino acid sequence realigns with wild type, producing a full-length protein. This explains why the enzyme has partial activity: the internal stretch is altered, but the remainder, including domains beyond that region, is identical.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to the description that the first $49$ amino acids match wild type, the segment from $50$ to $69$ is altered, and the remainder matches wild type again.
