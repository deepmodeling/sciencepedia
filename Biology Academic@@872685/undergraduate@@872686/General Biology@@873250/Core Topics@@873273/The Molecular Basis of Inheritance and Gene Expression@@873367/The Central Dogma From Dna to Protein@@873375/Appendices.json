This practice provides a direct contrast to the frameshift mutation by examining a \"silent\" point mutation. You will investigate how the redundancy, or \"degeneracy,\" of the genetic code allows different codons to specify the same amino acid, providing a buffer against genetic change [@problem_id:2317969].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the effects of a mutagen on the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. They isolate a gene of interest and determine a portion of its Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) template strand sequence to be $3'\\text{-TACCGC-}5'$. After exposing a culture of the bacteria to the mutagen, they sequence the same gene from a descendant bacterium and discover a single point mutation, where the sequence is now $3'\\text{-TACCGT-}5'$.\n\nDespite this change in the DNA, a biochemical analysis reveals that the primary amino acid sequence of the protein produced from this mutated gene is identical to the protein produced from the original, unmutated gene.\n\nTo aid in your analysis, a partial table of messenger Ribonucleic acid (mRNA) codons and their corresponding amino acids is provided below.

The ribosome possesses a proofreading function that replaced the incorrect amino acid with the correct one during protein synthesis.\n\nC. The point mutation was a frameshift mutation, which does not alter the primary amino acid sequence.\n\nD. The mutation occurred in the third base of the DNA triplet, a position which never influences the identity of the encoded amino acid.\n\nE.
