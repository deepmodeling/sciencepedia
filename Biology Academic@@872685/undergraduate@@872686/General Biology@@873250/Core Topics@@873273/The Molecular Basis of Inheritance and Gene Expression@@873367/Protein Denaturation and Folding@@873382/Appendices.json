The interface where the two subunits connect is a predominantly nonpolar, hydrophobic patch. A critical interaction at the center of this interface involves a leucine residue from each subunit fitting into a hydrophobic pocket on the opposing subunit. Genetic engineering is used to create a mutant version of CAD where this specific leucine residue on both subunits is replaced with an aspartate residue.

The mutation involves replacing a hydrophobic amino acid (leucine) with a negatively charged amino acid (aspartate) at the dimer interface.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** The wild-type protein is a functional homodimer. The two subunits are held together by interactions at a \"predominantly nonpolar, hydrophobic patch.\" The specific interaction mentioned is a leucine residue from each subunit nestling into a hydrophobic pocket on the other. This describes an interaction driven by the hydrophobic effect. In an aqueous environment, nonpolar groups cluster together to minimize their disruptive contact with water molecules, releasing ordered water and increasing the overall entropy of the system. This is a major driving force for protein folding and association.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mutation:** A leucine (Leu) is replaced by an aspartate (Asp).\n    *   **Leucine's side chain:** `-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is an alkyl group, which is nonpolar and hydrophobic.\n    *   **Aspartate's side chain:** `-CH2-COO-`. At a physiological pH of 7.4, which is well above the pKa of its carboxylic acid group (around 3.9), this side chain will be deprotonated and carry a full negative charge (`-CH2-COO-`). It is therefore highly polar and hydrophilic.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the consequences of the mutation on the dimer interface:**\n    *   The original stabilizing force was the hydrophobic effect, which involved burying the nonpolar leucine side chains at the interface, away from the surrounding water.\n    *   The mutation replaces these hydrophobic side chains with negatively charged, hydrophilic aspartate side chains.\n    *   Placing a charged group like aspartate into a hydrophobic environment is thermodynamically very unfavorable. The aspartate side chain would much rather be exposed to the aqueous solvent where it can be stabilized by hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions with water molecules.\n    *   Furthermore, when two mutant subunits approach each other, the two negatively charged aspartate residues at the interface will experience electrostatic repulsion. This repulsion directly opposes the association of the subunits.\n    *   Therefore, the mutation fundamentally undermines the primary force holding the dimer together (the hydrophobic effect) and introduces a new, strong repulsive force (electrostatic repulsion). The equilibrium will shift dramatically away from the dimer and towards the dissociated monomers.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the consequences for protein function:** The problem states that the enzyme \"functions optimally only when\" it is a dimer. If the mutation prevents dimerization, the protein will exist predominantly as monomers. These monomers, according to the problem description, are not functional (or at least not optimally functional). Thus, the mutation will lead to a loss of enzyme activity.\n\n5.  **Assess the given options:**\n    *   **A. The mutation will disrupt the hydrophobic interactions necessary for dimerization, leading to a predominance of non-functional monomers and a loss of enzyme activity.** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The hydrophobic interactions are disrupted, the dimer is destabilized, and since function depends on the dimeric form, activity is lost. This is the most likely outcome.\n    *   **B. The two new aspartate residues will form a strong salt bridge, stabilizing the dimer into a hyper-stable, rigid structure that enhances its catalytic activity.** This is incorrect. A salt bridge is an ionic bond between a positively charged residue and a negatively charged residue (e.g., between aspartate and lysine). An interaction between two identical negative charges (Asp-Asp) would be repulsive, not attractive.\n    *   **C. The mutation will have a negligible effect on the quaternary structure, but it will directly alter the shape of the active site on each monomer, rendering the enzyme inactive.** This is unlikely. A mutation at the dimer interface is most likely to affect dimerization itself (the quaternary structure). While it's possible the active site is nearby, the primary and most direct effect is on the stability of the dimer. The loss of function is a consequence of the loss of quaternary structure, not a separate, direct effect on the active site within the monomer.\n    *   **D. The replacement of a nonpolar residue with a charged one will cause the individual subunits to completely unfold their tertiary structure.** This is an overstatement. A single amino acid substitution, particularly on the surface of a folded domain (even if it's at an interface), is unlikely to cause the *complete* unfolding of the entire tertiary structure. The core of the monomer would likely remain folded. The primary effect is on the interaction *between* subunits, not the stability *within* a subunit.\n    *   **E. The two aspartate residues will be oxidized to form a covalent bond, permanently linking the two subunits and leading to a loss of the flexibility required for function.** This is chemically incorrect. Aspartate cannot be oxidized to form a covalent bond with another aspartate. The formation of covalent disulfide bonds involves the oxidation of the thiol groups of two cysteine residues.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes the physicochemical consequences of the Leu - Asp mutation at a hydrophobic protein-protein interface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310258"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analyzing existing proteins, scientists can redesign them to enhance their properties, a field known as protein engineering.
