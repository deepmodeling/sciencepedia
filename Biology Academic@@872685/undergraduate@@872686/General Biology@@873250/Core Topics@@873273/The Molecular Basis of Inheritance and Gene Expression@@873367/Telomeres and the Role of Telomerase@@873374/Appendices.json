[@problem_id:2316993]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the process of cellular aging in a culture of human diploid somatic cells. These cells contain 46 chromosomes in their nucleus. At the beginning of the experiment (defined as generation 0), the average length of a telomere at a single chromosome end is measured to be 9,850 base pairs (bp). Due to the end-replication problem, a fixed number of base pairs is lost from each telomere during every cell division. For this specific cell line, the rate of loss is consistently 80 bp per telomere per division. The cells in this culture have negligible telomerase activity, meaning no significant replenishment of telomeric DNA occurs. The cells are known to enter a state of irreversible growth arrest, known as replicative senescence, when the average telomere length drops to a critical threshold of 4,970 bp.\n\nCalculate the maximum number of times a cell from this population can divide before it is expected to enter senescence. Your answer should be the largest possible integer number of divisions.", "solution": "Let $n$ denote the number of completed cell divisions. Because a fixed amount $d$ of telomeric DNA is lost per telomere per division and telomerase activity is negligible, the average telomere length after $n$ divisions is\n$$\nL(n)=L_{0}-nd,\n$$\nwhere $L_{0}$ is the initial average length and $d$ is the loss per division per telomere.\n\nReplicative senescence occurs when the average telomere length reaches the critical threshold $L_{c}$.

This problem challenges you to step into the role of the telomerase enzyme itself, using a mutated RNA template to predict the resulting DNA sequence. This practice is crucial for mastering the principles of reverse transcription, base-pairing rules, and the fundamental mechanism by which telomerase synthesizes telomeric DNA. [@problem_id:2316955]", "problem": "In a molecular biology research laboratory, a team is studying the mechanism of cellular aging in a specific eukaryotic cell line. They focus on the enzyme telomerase, a reverse transcriptase responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres at the ends of linear chromosomes, thus counteracting the \"end-replication problem.\" Telomerase consists of a protein component and an RNA molecule known as the Telomerase RNA Component (TERC), which serves as a template for synthesizing the repetitive telomeric DNA sequence.\n\nIn the wild-type version of this cell line, a key region of the TERC template has the sequence 3'-AACCCUA-5'. The researchers introduce a point mutation into the gene encoding TERC, resulting in a new, stable template sequence of 3'-ACGCUUA-5' within the telomerase enzyme complex. Assume that this is the only mutation and that the telomerase enzyme remains catalytically active.\n\nWhat is the sequence of the single-stranded DNA that will now be synthesized by this mutant telomerase as it extends the 3' overhang of a chromosome end?\n\nA. 5'-TGCGAAT-3'\n\nB. 3'-TGCGAAT-5'\n\nC. 5'-UGCGAAT-3'\n\nD. 5'-ACGCUUA-3'\n\nE. 5'-ATTGCGT-3'", "solution": "The problem asks for the DNA sequence synthesized by a mutant telomerase enzyme. The core principle to solve this is understanding the function of telomerase as a reverse transcriptase and applying the rules of complementary base pairing and directionality of nucleic acid synthesis.\n\nFirst, we must identify the template sequence that the enzyme will use. The problem states that the mutated Telomerase RNA Component (TERC) has the sequence 3'-ACGCUUA-5'. This RNA sequence will serve as the template for DNA synthesis.\n\nSecond, we recall the rules of base pairing between an RNA template and a newly synthesized DNA strand. Telomerase, being a reverse transcriptase, follows these specific rules:\n- Adenine (A) in RNA pairs with Thymine (T) in DNA.\n- Uracil (U) in RNA pairs with Adenine (A) in DNA.\n- Cytosine (C) in RNA pairs with Guanine (G) in DNA.\n- Guanine (G) in RNA pairs with Cytosine (C) in DNA.\n\nThird, we must consider the directionality of synthesis. All known DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases synthesize new strands in the 5' to 3' direction. They do this by reading the template strand in the opposite, 3' to 5' direction. The problem provides the template strand in this 3' to 5' orientation, which is the direction it is read by the enzyme.\n\nNow, we can determine the sequence of the new DNA strand by proceeding along the RNA template from its 3' end to its 5' end, and writing down the complementary DNA bases to form a new strand growing in the 5' to 3' direction.\n\nThe template is: 3'- A C G C U U A -5'\n\n1.

The enzyme moves to the next RNA base, 'C'. It adds the complementary DNA base, 'G'.\n    New DNA: 5'-TG...\n\n3.  The next RNA base is 'G'. The complementary DNA base is 'C'.\n    New DNA: 5'-TGC...\n\n4.  The next RNA base is 'C'. The complementary DNA base is 'G'.\n    New DNA: 5'-TGCG...\n\n5.  The next RNA base is 'U'.

This is added to the 3' end of the growing DNA strand.\n    New DNA: 5'-TGCGAAT-3'\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence of the newly synthesized DNA strand is 5'-TGCGAAT-3'.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n- A. 5'-TGCGAAT-3': This matches our derived sequence and polarity.\n- B. 3'-TGCGAAT-5': This sequence is correct, but the polarity is reversed.
