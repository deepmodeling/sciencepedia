This introductory exercise explores the crucial \"scanning\" phase of initiation in eukaryotes and how physical roadblocks on the mRNA transcript can prevent the cellular machinery from getting started. By considering a hypothetical mRNA with a stable secondary structure, you can develop an intuition for why the 5' untranslated region's structure is as important as its sequence. [@problem_id:2322786]", "problem": "A molecular biology student is designing a synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule for expression in a eukaryotic cell culture system. The goal is to produce a large quantity of a specific protein. The engineered mRNA consists of a 5' cap, a 5' Un-Translated Region (UTR), a protein-coding sequence beginning with an AUG start codon, and a 3' poly-A tail. By mistake, a sequence was included in the 5' UTR, located between the 5' cap and the start codon, that folds into an unusually stable hairpin loop structure. This secondary structure has a very high melting temperature, indicating strong base-pairing.\n\nAssuming the standard cap-dependent mechanism for translation initiation is the primary pathway in this system, what is the most likely effect of this stable hairpin loop on the synthesis of the target protein?\n\nA. The rate of protein synthesis will increase because the hairpin loop protects the mRNA from degradation by exonucleases, increasing its functional half-life.\n\nB. The efficiency of translation initiation will be severely reduced, leading to a very low yield of the protein.\n\nC. The process of translation elongation will be significantly slowed, but initiation will occur at a normal rate.\n\nD. The ribosome will skip the primary AUG start codon and initiate translation at a different, downstream AUG codon, resulting in a truncated protein.\n\nE. The overall process of translation will be unaffected, as the helicase activity of the initiation complex is sufficient to unwind any secondary structure.", "solution": "1) In eukaryotic cap-dependent translation initiation, the 43S preinitiation complex (40S ribosomal subunit, initiation factors, and Met-tRNAi) is recruited to the 5' cap via the eIF4F complex (eIF4E binds the cap, eIF4G scaffolds, and eIF4A is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase). The complex then scans the 5' UTR in the 5' to 3' direction to locate the first suitable AUG in an appropriate Kozak context.\n\n2) Scanning requires eIF4A (with cofactor eIF4B) to unwind secondary structures in the 5' UTR. While moderate structures can be resolved by this helicase activity, an unusually stable hairpin with a high melting temperature indicates very strong base pairing and high thermodynamic stability that can exceed the unwinding capacity of the initiation machinery.\n\n3) When a highly stable hairpin loop is positioned between the 5' cap and the start codon, it can impede or prevent the scanning complex from progressing from the cap to the AUG. This primarily compromises the initiation step, which is generally rate-limiting in translation, resulting in markedly decreased initiation events.\n\n4) Consequences for the answer choices:\n- A is unlikely: although secondary structures can sometimes modestly impact stability, a strong 5' UTR hairpin near the cap predominantly blocks initiation rather than increasing protein output; any protective effect on degradation does not overcome the strong initiation block.\n- B is consistent: initiation is severely reduced because scanning is blocked by the stable hairpin, yielding very low protein levels.\n- C is incorrect: elongation occurs only after successful initiation; the described block precedes initiation, so elongation is not the primary affected phase.\n- D is unlikely: the ribosome cannot skip the primary AUG if it cannot scan past the hairpin; the block occurs before reaching the AUG.\n- E is incorrect: the helicase activity of the initiation complex has limited capacity; a very stable structure with high melting temperature can resist unwinding and inhibit initiation.\n\n5) Therefore, the most likely effect is a severe reduction in translation initiation efficiency, leading to a very low yield of the protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2322786"}, {"introduction": "Once initiated, the ribosome moves along the mRNA in a highly coordinated cycle of elongation, adding amino acids one by one. This practice problem uses a hypothetical inhibitor, \"Stallimycin,\" to freeze the ribosome at a specific moment in this cycle—right after a peptide bond has formed but before the ribosome has moved. Analyzing this stalled state helps clarify the precise sequence of events and the roles of key players like eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 ($eEF-2$) in driving the process forward. [@problem_id:2322751]", "problem": "An in-vitro translation system is prepared using components isolated from a eukaryotic cell line. This system contains functional ribosomes, a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript, all 20 types of amino acids, and a complete set of charged transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Additionally, it includes all necessary protein factors for initiation, elongation, and termination, along with a sufficient supply of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nA researcher introduces a highly specific inhibitor called \"Stallimycin\" into this system before initiating translation. Stallimycin is known to bind exclusively to eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 (eEF-2), the protein responsible for catalyzing the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA, rendering eEF-2 non-functional.\n\nThe experiment begins, and translation initiates correctly. The ribosome assembles at the start codon, and the first peptide bond successfully forms between the initial methionine (in the P-site) and the second amino acid (brought by a tRNA to the A-site).\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the state of the ribosomal complex immediately following the formation of this first peptide bond?\n\nA. The ribosome will be stalled with a dipeptidyl-tRNA in the A-site and an uncharged tRNA in the P-site.\n\nB. The ribosome will prematurely disassemble, releasing the mRNA and the newly formed dipeptide.\n\nC. The A-site of the ribosome will be empty, exposing a new codon and awaiting the arrival of the next aminoacyl-tRNA.\n\nD. The peptidyl transferase center will be inhibited, preventing the formation of any further peptide bonds.\n\nE. The uncharged tRNA will be in the E-site, poised for release from the ribosome.", "solution": "Fundamental elongation steps in eukaryotic translation are as follows: (i) delivery of an aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site by eEF-1A with GTP hydrolysis, (ii) peptidyl transfer catalyzed by the large subunit rRNA (peptidyl transferase activity), transferring the nascent peptide from the P-site tRNA to the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A-site, and (iii) translocation of the ribosome by one codon mediated by eEF-2 with GTP hydrolysis, which moves the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site, the deacylated tRNA from the P-site to the E-site, and opens the A-site for the next aminoacyl-tRNA.\n\nIn the described system, initiation proceeds normally, placing Met-tRNA in the P-site and allowing an aminoacyl-tRNA to enter the A-site. The first peptide bond forms correctly, so the peptidyl transferase has transferred the peptide to the A-site tRNA. Immediately after this peptide bond formation and before translocation, the ribosomal complex is in the pre-translocation state: the A-site holds the peptidyl-tRNA (now a dipeptidyl-tRNA) and the P-site holds a deacylated (uncharged) tRNA. Translocation to move these tRNAs to the P- and E-sites, respectively, requires functional eEF-2.\n\nBecause Stallimycin specifically inhibits eEF-2, the translocation step cannot occur. Therefore, the ribosome becomes stalled in the pre-translocation state, with a dipeptidyl-tRNA remaining in the A-site and an uncharged tRNA remaining in the P-site. This directly supports option A.\n\nBy contrast: (B) premature disassembly does not occur simply from blocked translocation; termination requires a stop codon and release factors. (C) an empty A-site exposing a new codon would require successful translocation, which is blocked. (D) peptidyl transferase is not inhibited by eEF-2 inhibition and has already formed the first peptide bond. (E) placement of the uncharged tRNA into the E-site requires translocation, which is blocked here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2322751"}, {"introduction": "Every protein-coding message has a defined end, marked by a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to release the newly made polypeptide. This final exercise examines what happens when a single-letter change in the genetic blueprint creates a premature stop signal, a common type of disease-causing mutation. By identifying the specific molecular player that recognizes this stop signal, you will understand the fundamental mechanism of translation termination and its importance for producing functional proteins.

They isolate a mutant strain that produces a non-functional, significantly shorter version of this enzyme. Upon sequencing the messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) produced from the mutant gene, they find a single point mutation. In the wild-type (normal) yeast, a specific codon in the middle of the coding sequence is $5^{\\prime}\\text{-CGA-}3'$. In the mutant strain, this codon has been altered to $5^{\\prime}\\text{-UGA-}3'$.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the direct molecular consequence of this $5^{\\prime}\\text{-UGA-}3'$ codon arriving at the A-site of the ribosome during translation?\n\nA. The ribosome stalls indefinitely at this position, as no transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule can recognize the codon.\n\nB. A tRNA molecule that is charged with the amino acid Tryptophan binds to the A-site, causing an incorrect amino acid to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain.\n\nC. A specialized tRNA that carries no amino acid binds to the A-site, effectively blocking the ribosome and preventing any further elongation.\n\nD. A protein called a release factor binds to the A-site, which triggers the hydrolysis of the bond between the polypeptide chain and the tRNA in the P-site.\n\nE. The ribosomal machinery recognizes the codon as an error, excises it from the mRNA, and continues translation with the next codon in the sequence.", "solution": "The genetic code specifies amino acids or termination signals via codons in mRNA. The wild-type codon $5^{\\prime}\\text{-CGA-}3^{\\prime}$ encodes Arginine. The mutation to $5^{\\prime}\\text{-UGA-}3^{\\prime}$ changes this to one of the three standard stop codons ($\\text{UAA}$, $\\text{UAG}$, $\\text{UGA}$) in the canonical eukaryotic cytosolic genetic code used by yeast ribosomes.\n\nDuring translation elongation, each incoming codon in the A-site is decoded either by an aminoacyl-tRNA (for sense codons) or by a release factor (for stop codons). In eukaryotes, a protein release factor (eRF1), in concert with eRF3 bound to GTP, recognizes any stop codon in the A-site. Binding of the release factor to the A-site does not add an amino acid; instead, it catalyzes peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, cleaving the ester bond linking the nascent polypeptide to the tRNA in the P-site. This reaction terminates translation and releases the truncated polypeptide, explaining the observed shorter, nonfunctional enzyme.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because the ribosome does not stall indefinitely; it recruits release factors.\n- Option B is incorrect because tryptophan is encoded by $\\text{UGG}$ in the standard code; $\\text{UGA}$ is a stop codon (selenocysteine insertion requires specialized elements absent here).\n- Option C is incorrect because the decoding factor is a protein release factor, not a specialized tRNA lacking an amino acid.\n- Option D correctly states that a release factor binds the A-site and triggers hydrolysis of the polypeptide–tRNA bond in the P-site.\n- Option E is incorrect because the ribosome does not excise codons from mRNA.\n\nThus, the accurate description is that a release factor binds and induces termination via hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA linkage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2322767"}]}
