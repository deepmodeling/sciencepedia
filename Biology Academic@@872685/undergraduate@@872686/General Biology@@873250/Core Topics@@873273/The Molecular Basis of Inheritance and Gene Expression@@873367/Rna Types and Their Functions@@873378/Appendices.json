Trp-Leu-Asp", "solution": "The fundamental process described is the translation of a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into a polypeptide chain of amino acids. The process follows a specific set of rules encoded in the genetic code.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reading Frame**\nTranslation begins at a specific start codon and proceeds in a 5' to 3' direction along the mRNA molecule. The universally recognized start codon is AUG, which also codes for the amino acid Methionine. The given mRNA sequence is 5'-AUGGCUAGAUAA-3'. We scan from the 5' end and find the start codon AUG at the very beginning. This establishes the reading frame for the rest of the sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Group the Sequence into Codons**\nStarting with the AUG codon, we group the rest of the nucleotide sequence into non-overlapping groups of three bases.\nThe sequence is 5'-AUG GCU AGA UAA-3'.\n- The first codon is AUG.\n- The second codon is GCU.\n- The third codon is AGA.\n- The fourth codon is UAA.\n\n**Step 3: Translate Each Codon into an Amino Acid**\nWe use the provided genetic code table to translate each codon sequentially.\n\n- **Codon 1: AUG**\n  Looking at the table under \"First base A\", we find that AUG codes for Methionine (Met). It also serves as the START signal. So, the polypeptide begins with Met.\n\n- **Codon 2: GCU**\n  Looking at the table under \"First base G\", we find that GCU is one of the codons for Alanine (Ala).\n\n- **Codon 3: AGA**\n  Looking at the table under \"First base A\", we find that AGA codes for Arginine (Arg).\n\n- **Codon 4: UAA**\n  Looking at the table under \"First base U\", we find that UAA is a STOP codon.\n\n**Step 4: Terminate Translation**\nWhen the ribosome encounters a STOP codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA), translation is terminated. The STOP codon itself does not code for an amino acid; it signals the release of the newly synthesized polypeptide chain. Therefore, the sequence of amino acids ends with the amino acid coded by the codon immediately preceding the stop codon.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Polypeptide Sequence**\nCombining the translated amino acids in order, we get:\nMethionine (Met) - Alanine (Ala) - Arginine (Arg)\n\nThe full polypeptide sequence is Met-Ala-Arg.\n\n**Step 6: Compare with Multiple-Choice Options**\n- A. Met-Ala-Arg: This matches our derived sequence.\n- B. Met-Ala-Arg-Stop: Incorrect. The stop codon terminates translation but is not incorporated as an amino acid.\n- C. Asn-Arg-Ser-Val: Incorrect. This sequence would result from reading the mRNA in the reverse 3' to 5' direction (3'-AAUAGAUGCGGA-5'), which is not how translation occurs. The codons would be AAU (Asn), AGA (Arg), UCG (Ser), GUA (Val).\n- D. Met-Gly-Arg: Incorrect. This would imply the second codon was for Glycine (e.g., GGU), not Alanine (GCU).\n- E. Trp-Leu-Asp: Incorrect. This is the result of a frameshift error, starting the reading frame one nucleotide late (from the 'G' in AUG). The codons would be UGG (Trp), CUA (Leu), GAU (Asp).\n\nTherefore, the correct amino acid sequence is Met-Ala-Arg.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2313712"}, {"introduction": "This problem presents a fascinating hypothetical scenario designed to test your understanding of the transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule's role as the \"adaptor\" in translation. It challenges the assumption that the system is flawless by introducing a mutant tRNA that recognizes the wrong codon.

A mutation has rendered the transfer RNA (tRNA) that normally recognizes the messenger RNA (mRNA) codon 5'-CUG-3' completely non-functional.

This second mutation alters the anticodon of that specific tyrosine-tRNA, causing it to recognize the 5'-CUG-3' codon instead of its usual target.

This practice explores the concept of RNA editing, a powerful mechanism that alters the sequence of an mRNA transcript after it has been synthesized from DNA. The scenario, based on a real and vital process in the nervous system, demonstrates how a single nucleotide change can dramatically alter the function of the resulting protein, in this case, an ion channel critical for brain function [@problem_id:2313702].", "problem": "A neurobiologist is investigating the protein structure of a critical ion channel in the brain, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor. They focus on the GluA2 subunit, which forms a part of the channel's central pore. Analysis of the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) reveals that the codon on the coding strand for a key amino acid in this pore region is `CAG`. However, when mature messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is isolated from adult brain cells and sequenced, the corresponding codon is found to be `CIG`, where `I` denotes the non-standard nucleotide inosine.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following:\n1.  During translation, the cell's ribosomal machinery interprets the base inosine (I) as if it were guanosine (G).\n2.  The ion channel pore is the narrowest part of the channel, and the chemical properties of the amino acids lining it determine which ions can pass through. The primary ions that move through AMPA receptors are positively charged, such as $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$.\n3.  A partial genetic code table is provided below, listing mRNA codons and the amino acids they specify:\n    -   `CAG`: Glutamine (Gln), a neutral, polar amino acid.\n    -   `CAA`: Glutamine (Gln)\n    -   `CGG`: Arginine (Arg), a positively charged, polar amino acid.\n    -   `CGA`: Arginine (Arg)\n    -   `UAG`: Stop codon\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements describes the most likely functional consequence of this change from the genomic blueprint to the mature mRNA transcript?\n\nA. The modification results in a silent mutation, leading to no change in the receptor's primary structure or function.\n\nB. The modification introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated and likely non-functional receptor protein.\n\nC. The modification substitutes a neutral amino acid with a positively charged one in the channel pore, which is expected to decrease the channel's permeability to positively charged ions like $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nD. The modification substitutes a neutral amino acid with a negatively charged one, which is expected to increase the channel's permeability to positively charged ions like $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nE. The modification substitutes a neutral amino acid with a positively charged one, which is expected to attract and thereby increase the channel's permeability to positively charged ions like $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$.", "solution": "We begin by relating the coding strand of the DNA to the mRNA sequence. For a given codon on the coding strand, the transcribed mRNA codon has the same 5' to 3' sequence with thymine replaced by uracil. Therefore, a coding-strand codon `CAG` would ordinarily yield an mRNA codon `CAG`, which the provided genetic code indicates specifies glutamine (Gln), a neutral, polar amino acid.\n\nThe isolated mature mRNA instead contains the codon `CIG`, where `I` denotes inosine. By the given assumption, during translation inosine is interpreted as if it were guanosine. Hence, the ribosome effectively reads `CIG` as `CGG`.\n\nUsing the provided genetic code table, `CGG` specifies arginine (Arg), a positively charged, polar amino acid. Thus, the RNA editing event has converted the encoded amino acid from glutamine (neutral, polar) to arginine (positively charged, polar). This is not a silent change, and it does not introduce a stop codon, since `CIG` read as `CGG` is not `UAG`.\n\nNext, we consider the functional effect in the channel pore. The pore’s ion selectivity and permeability depend on the chemical properties of the lining residues. Introducing a positively charged side chain (arginine) in the pore increases positive electrostatic potential in that region. By electrostatic principles (like charges repel), positively charged ions such as $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$ experience electrostatic repulsion in a positively charged environment. Therefore, replacing a neutral residue (glutamine) with a positively charged residue (arginine) in the pore is expected to decrease permeability to positively charged ions, particularly $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because the substitution changes the amino acid (not silent).\n- B is false because no stop codon is created (`CIG` read as `CGG` is not `UAG`).\n- C is true: neutral to positively charged substitution in the pore should decrease cation permeability such as for $Ca^{2+}$.\n- D is false because the substitution is not to a negatively charged residue.\n- E is false because a positively charged pore would not attract but rather repel cations, decreasing their permeability.\n\nTherefore, the most likely functional consequence is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2313702"}]}
