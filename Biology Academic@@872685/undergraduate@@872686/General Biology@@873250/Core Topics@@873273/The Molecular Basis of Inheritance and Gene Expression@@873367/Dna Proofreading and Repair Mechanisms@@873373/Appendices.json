In *Escherichia coli*, this high fidelity is maintained by the proofreading capability of DNA Polymerase III. Consider a hypothetical scenario involving two strains of *E. coli*. The wild-type strain possesses a fully functional DNA Polymerase III. The mutant strain possesses a genetically altered DNA Polymerase III in which the $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease activity (the proofreading function) has been completely abolished, but its $5' \\to 3'$ polymerase (synthesis) activity remains unchanged.\n\nAssume the following parameters for the replication process in *E. coli*:\n- The intrinsic error rate of the $5' \\to 3'$ polymerase activity, $\\epsilon_{pol}$, is $1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ errors per base pair incorporated.\n- The failure rate of the $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease proofreading mechanism, $\\epsilon_{proof}$, is $1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$.

Let $G$ be the number of bases incorporated in a complete round of genome replication.\n\nBy the law of total expectation under independence across sites, the expected number of mutations introduced in one complete round of replication equals the per-base error probability after all considered processes times the number of bases incorporated.\n\nFor the mutant strain (no proofreading), the per-base error probability is simply that of the polymerase:\n$$\np_{\\text{mut}}=\\epsilon_{pol}.\n$$\nThus, the expected number of mutations per replication is\n$$\nM_{\\text{mut}}=G\\,\\epsilon_{pol}.\n$$\n\nFor the wild-type strain (with proofreading), a base must first be misincorporated by the polymerase and then escape correction by proofreading.

Loss of this activity increases the persistence of base mispairs at the time of synthesis, leading predominantly to single-base substitutions (both transitions and transversions) distributed genome-wide. Because proofreading primarily addresses base misincorporation at the primer terminus rather than correcting looped-out intermediates from strand slippage, its loss is expected to cause only a marginal increase in small insertion/deletion mutations.\n\nBy contrast, the post-replicative mismatch repair system, initiated by MutS recognition, corrects two main classes of replication errors: base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops, especially those arising from polymerase slippage within short tandem repeats (microsatellites). A null mutation in MutS abolishes recognition and repair of these errors, producing microsatellite instability characterized by a dramatic increase in 1–4 base pair insertion/deletion mutations concentrated in repetitive tracts, along with a moderate increase in single-base substitutions.\n\nComparing these mechanistic expectations to the observed profiles:\n- Profile 1 shows a high frequency of single-base substitutions with only a marginal increase in small indels, which aligns with the predicted outcome of losing polymerase proofreading.\n- Profile 2 shows a very dramatic increase in small indels within microsatellites and a moderate increase in substitutions, which aligns with the predicted outcome of losing MutS-dependent mismatch repair.\n\nTherefore, Cell Line X (loss of proofreading) corresponds to Profile 1, and Cell Line Y (loss of MutS/MMR) corresponds to Profile 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2080934"}]}
