{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The beating of cilia and flagella is a marvel of molecular engineering, powered by the dynein motor protein. To understand how this motor converts chemical energy from ATP into mechanical force, scientists often use ATP analogs to \"freeze\" the motor at specific stages of its cycle. This thought experiment challenges you to predict what happens when dynein is given an ATP molecule it can bind but cannot hydrolyze, allowing you to isolate the crucial role of ATP binding itself in the process of microtubule sliding [@problem_id:2284100].", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism of ciliary and flagellar motion. Researchers isolate axonemes, the core microtubule-based structures of cilia, from a eukaryotic organism. The standard '9+2' arrangement of microtubule doublets, interconnected by dynein arms, is confirmed to be intact. These isolated axonemes are then placed in a buffer solution that contains a high concentration of a synthetic analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), known as AMP-PNP. This analog is structurally similar to ATP and can bind to the ATP-binding sites of proteins, but it is non-hydrolyzable, meaning the terminal phosphate bond cannot be broken by enzymatic activity.\n\nAssuming the isolated axonemes are observed under a high-resolution microscope after the addition of AMP-PNP, which of the following outcomes would be expected?\n\nA. The axoneme will become extremely rigid as the dynein arms form permanent, strong cross-links with the adjacent microtubule doublets.\n\nB. The axoneme will exhibit continuous, rapid bending and unbending, similar to its normal biological function with regular ATP.\n\nC. The axoneme will remain in a relaxed, static state, with the dynein arms detaching from the adjacent microtubule doublets after binding the AMP-PNP.\n\nD. The microtubule doublets of the axoneme will actively slide past one another until they completely dissociate from the structure.\n\nE. The axoneme will perform a single, powerful bending motion and then become permanently locked in the bent conformation.", "solution": "To determine the outcome of the experiment, we must analyze the normal cycle of the dynein motor protein and how it is affected by a non-hydrolyzable adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analog like AMP-PNP.\n\n1.  **Structure and Function of the Axoneme**: The axoneme's movement is driven by the motor protein dynein. Dynein arms are attached to the 'A' microtubule of one doublet and transiently interact with the 'B' microtubule of an adjacent doublet. The coordinated action of these dynein arms causes the microtubule doublets to slide past one another. Because the doublets are held together by nexin links and anchored at the base, this sliding motion is converted into a bending motion, which is characteristic of ciliary and flagellar beating.\n\n2.  **The Dynein-ATP Mechanical Cycle**: The interaction of dynein with microtubules is tightly regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. The cycle proceeds as follows:\n    *   **Step i (Initial State)**: In the absence of ATP, the dynein head is tightly bound to the B-tubule of the adjacent doublet in a 'rigor' state.\n    *   **Step ii (ATP Binding)**: The binding of an ATP molecule to the dynein head induces a conformational change that causes the dynein head to detach from the microtubule.\n    *   **Step iii (ATP Hydrolysis)**: The dynein head hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The energy released from this hydrolysis causes the dynein motor to undergo another conformational change, moving it into a \"cocked\" or high-energy position.\n    *   **Step iv (Rebinding and Power Stroke)**: The cocked dynein head weakly rebinds to a new site on the adjacent B-tubule, further along the axoneme. The subsequent release of Pi, followed by ADP, triggers the \"power stroke.\" During the power stroke, the dynein head returns to its original, low-energy conformation, forcefully sliding the adjacent doublet along. The cycle is then ready to begin again.\n\n3.  **Effect of a Non-Hydrolyzable ATP Analog (AMP-PNP)**: The problem states that AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable analog, is supplied.\n    *   Like ATP, AMP-PNP can bind to the ATP-binding site on the dynein head.\n    *   Following the normal cycle (Step ii), this binding will cause the dynein head to release its grip on the adjacent microtubule doublet.\n    *   However, because AMP-PNP cannot be hydrolyzed, the cycle is arrested at this point. Step (iii), the hydrolysis step that \"cocks\" the motor for the power stroke, cannot occur.\n    *   Without hydrolysis, there is no subsequent rebinding to the microtubule and no power stroke.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**: The net effect is that the dynein arms will bind the ATP analog and, as a result, remain in a state of detachment from the adjacent microtubule doublets. This prevents any sliding or bending motion. The axoneme will be static.\n\n    *   **A is incorrect**: A rigid state (rigor) occurs in the *absence* of ATP. The binding of ATP or its analog causes *detachment*, not stronger locking.\n    *   **B is incorrect**: Rapid bending requires the complete cycle of ATP hydrolysis and power strokes, which is blocked. This would be the expected result if normal ATP were added.\n    *   **C is correct**: The binding of AMP-PNP causes the dynein arms to detach from the microtubules, and since no further steps in the cycle can occur, the axoneme remains in a relaxed and static state.\n    *   **D is incorrect**: Sliding requires the power stroke, which is dependent on ATP hydrolysis. Without hydrolysis, no sliding occurs.\n    *   **E is incorrect**: A power stroke only occurs *after* ATP hydrolysis and rebinding. Since hydrolysis is blocked, the power stroke cannot be initiated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2284100"}, {"introduction": "A cilium's ability to move fluid depends not just on its power, but on the specific shape of its beat. In the microscopic world, where viscosity dominates inertia, simply moving back and forth is not enough to get anywhere. This exercise explores this counterintuitive principle by asking you to consider a cilium with a symmetric, but ineffective, beat cycle, providing a practical application of the famous \"scallop theorem\" from physics [@problem_id:2284111].", "problem": "The inner lining of the human oviduct (fallopian tube) is composed of epithelial cells covered in motile cilia. The coordinated beating of these cilia is essential for generating a fluid current that transports the oocyte from the ovary to the uterus. The normal motion of a single cilium involves two distinct phases: a rapid, rigid \"power stroke\" that propels fluid in one direction, followed by a slower, flexible \"recovery stroke\" where the cilium bends and returns to its initial position close to the cell surface, minimizing resistance.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic mutation that affects the structure of the dynein motor proteins within these cilia. This mutation allows the cilia to perform a normal, rigid power stroke. However, it prevents the cilia from bending during the recovery phase. Instead, after completing a power stroke, the cilium remains rigid and returns to its starting position by executing a motion that is essentially a power stroke in reverse.\n\nGiven this specific ciliary defect, what would be the most likely outcome for oocyte transport within the oviduct?\n\nA. The oocyte would be transported towards the uterus at an accelerated rate.\n\nB. The oocyte would be transported in the reverse direction, towards the ovary.\n\nC. The oocyte would exhibit localized oscillatory movement but would show little to no net displacement.\n\nD. The cilia would lose their coordination and beat in random directions, leading to turbulent, non-directional fluid flow.\n\nE. The transport of the oocyte would be largely unaffected because the power stroke is the primary determinant of fluid movement.", "solution": "We analyze ciliary-driven transport in the oviduct in the low Reynolds number regime. The characteristic Reynolds number is $Re = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}$, where $\\rho$ is fluid density, $U$ a characteristic velocity, $L$ a characteristic length scale (cilia length), and $\\mu$ the dynamic viscosity. For microscopic cilia and slow flows, $Re \\ll 1$, so the fluid dynamics are well approximated by Stokes flow, given by\n$$\n\\nabla p = \\mu \\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0.\n$$\nThese equations are linear and kinematically reversible: if a boundary motion is exactly reversed in time, the flow field is exactly reversed. This underlies Purcell’s scallop theorem, which states that at $Re \\to 0$, any reciprocal (time-reversible) stroke pattern produces zero net propulsion or pumping over a cycle.\n\nNormal cilia achieve net transport by using a non-reciprocal beat: an effective (power) stroke where the cilium is extended and pushes fluid, followed by a recovery stroke where the cilium bends close to the surface, thereby reducing the backward drag. This geometric and hydrodynamic asymmetry breaks time-reversal symmetry and yields a nonzero time-averaged flow towards the uterus.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{u}(t)$ denote the instantaneous fluid velocity contribution (or induced oocyte velocity) due to the ciliary beat at time $t$, over a period $T$. The net displacement over one cycle is\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{r} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbf{u}(t)\\, dt.\n$$\nIn the hypothetical mutation, the power stroke is normal, but the recovery stroke is a rigid reverse of the power stroke. This makes the entire beat cycle reciprocal: the shape sequence in the second half-cycle is the time reverse of the first half. For a reciprocal stroke in Stokes flow, kinematic reversibility implies\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(t) = -\\mathbf{u}(T - t),\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{r} = \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\mathbf{u}(t)\\, dt + \\int_{T/2}^{T} \\mathbf{u}(t)\\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\mathbf{u}(t)\\, dt + \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\mathbf{u}(T - \\tau)\\, d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\left[\\mathbf{u}(t) - \\mathbf{u}(T - t)\\right] dt = \\mathbf{0}.\n$$\nThus, there is no net transport over a cycle. The oocyte would undergo back-and-forth oscillations with little to no net displacement.\n\nThis rules out accelerated transport towards the uterus (A), reverse transport (B), and the assertion that transport is unaffected because only the power stroke matters (E). The defect does not inherently cause loss of coordination and turbulence (D); rather, it makes the stroke reciprocal, eliminating net pumping. Therefore, the most likely outcome is localized oscillatory motion with negligible net movement.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2284111"}, {"introduction": "While axonemal dynein drives the beat of flagella, other types of dynein perform essential transport jobs inside the cell, such as powering Intraflagellar Transport (IFT). Developing drugs that selectively target one type of dynein over another is a major challenge in cell biology.

The model organism for this assay is a genetically engineered strain of *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, a unicellular green alga with two flagella. In this strain, a key protein component of the Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) machinery is fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\n\nThe assay relies on two key measurements for each tested compound:\n1.  **Swimming Speed**: This is a direct measure of flagellar function. The flagellar \"axonemal\" dyneins are the motors that power the flagellar beat. Their inhibition leads to a decrease in swimming speed.\n2.  **Flagellar Tip Accumulation Index (FTAI)**: This is a proxy for the function of cytoplasmic dynein. In *Chlamydomonas*, a specific type of cytoplasmic dynein (Dynein-2) is responsible for retrograde IFT, which brings IFT machinery back from the flagellar tip to the cell body. Inhibition of this dynein causes the GFP-tagged IFT particles to accumulate at the flagellar tip. The FTAI is a dimensionless, quantitative measure of this accumulation, calculated as the ratio of GFP fluorescence intensity at the distal tip of the flagellum to the average intensity along the flagellar shaft.\n\nTo quantify the specificity of a compound, the researchers define a metric called the Dynein Specificity Score (DSS). A higher DSS indicates better specificity for flagellar dynein.
