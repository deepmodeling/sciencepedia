Through genetic engineering, the lysosomes within these cells are altered. While they retain a full complement of functional proteases (for digesting proteins) and lipases (for digesting lipids), they have completely lost the ability to produce any glycosidases, which are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in complex carbohydrates. These cells are grown in a standard culture medium containing all necessary nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most direct and immediate consequence of this specific enzymatic deficiency for the cells?\n\nA. The cells will be unable to break down proteins obtained through endocytosis, leading to an accumulation of protein aggregates.\n\nB. The lysosomes will swell due to an accumulation of undigested lipid droplets, impairing their function.\n\nC. The cells will exhibit an abnormal buildup of polysaccharides and glycolipids within their lysosomes.\n\nD. The rate of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthesis will immediately decrease due to the inability to process glucose from the medium.\n\nE. The cells will be unable to synthesize new proteins because the amino acid pool from lysosomal recycling is depleted.", "solution": "We analyze the functional consequences of selectively abolishing lysosomal glycosidases while preserving lysosomal proteases and lipases.\n\nLysosomes are responsible for degrading macromolecules delivered via endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy. Degradation requires specific hydrolases: proteases for proteins, lipases for lipids, and glycosidases for carbohydrate moieties, including the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids, and complex polysaccharides such as glycosaminoglycans. If glycosidases are absent, the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins and glycolipids, as well as lysosome-directed polysaccharides, cannot be hydrolyzed. This leads to the progressive storage of undigested carbohydrate-rich material within lysosomes, a hallmark of lysosomal storage disorders affecting glycosidases (e.g., mucopolysaccharidoses and certain gangliosidoses).\n\nOption-by-option evaluation:\n- A is incorrect because proteases are intact, so lysosomal degradation of the protein components of endocytosed cargo can proceed; there is no primary block in protein catabolism.\n- B is incorrect because lipases are intact, so neutral lipids and the lipid portions of cargo can be hydrolyzed. Although glycolipids contain lipid moieties, their carbohydrate headgroups require glycosidases; failure to remove sugars leads to accumulation of glycolipids as carbohydrate-decorated species in lysosomes, not simple lipid droplet accumulation due to failed lipolysis.\n- C is correct because the immediate and direct effect of lacking glycosidases is impaired degradation of carbohydrate-rich substrates, causing lysosomal accumulation of polysaccharides (e.g., glycosaminoglycans) and glycolipids (due to undegraded sugar headgroups).\n- D is incorrect because glucose uptake and metabolism via glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation occur in the cytosol and mitochondria, independent of lysosomal glycosidases. With glucose present in the medium, ATP synthesis does not immediately decrease due to this specific lysosomal defect.\n- E is incorrect because proteases are functional and the medium supplies amino acids; lysosomal recycling of amino acids is not abolished, so protein synthesis is not acutely impaired.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is the lysosomal accumulation of carbohydrate-rich substrates, specifically polysaccharides and glycolipids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2301134"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its enzymatic contents, the lysosome's unique physical environment is a defining and functionally critical feature. The highly acidic lumen is not only required to activate degradative enzymes but is also cleverly exploited by numerous pathogens, including many viruses, to facilitate their entry into the host cell cytoplasm. This problem places you in the role of a researcher tasked with thwarting a viral infection, requiring you to apply your knowledge of lysosomal physiology to propose a targeted therapeutic strategy [@problem_id:2301153].", "problem": "A team of virologists is studying a newly discovered enveloped virus, designated \"Lysovir-1,\" which preferentially infects human macrophages. Their research reveals that the virus enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis, becoming enclosed within an endosome. The crucial step for infection occurs when this endosome fuses with a lysosome. The highly acidic environment of the resulting endolysosome, with a pH of approximately 4.5, is essential. This low pH induces a conformational change in a viral fusion protein, allowing the viral envelope to fuse with the endolysosomal membrane and release the viral genetic material into the host cell's cytoplasm.\n\nAs a member of the research team, you are tasked with identifying the most effective therapeutic strategy to specifically block this pH-dependent uncoating step of the Lysovir-1 replication cycle. Below is a list of candidate experimental drugs with their known mechanisms of action. Which drug would be the most direct and specific inhibitor for this process?\n\nA. **Colchicine:** A compound that binds to tubulin subunits and prevents their polymerization into microtubules, thereby disrupting intracellular transport along these cytoskeletal tracks.\n\nB. **Receptin-MIMIC:** A soluble, synthetic peptide designed to mimic the host cell receptor, effectively binding to Lysovir-1 virions in the extracellular space before they can attach to a cell.\n\nC. **Alkalone-4:** A lipophilic weak base that freely diffuses across biological membranes in its neutral state. In acidic compartments like lysosomes, it becomes protonated, which traps it inside and causes a significant increase in the organelle's internal pH.\n\nD. **Synthase-STOP:** A potent inhibitor of the host cell's ribosomal machinery, halting all cellular protein synthesis.\n\nE. **Protease Inhibitor Z:** A small molecule that specifically and irreversibly binds to the active site of the viral protease required for processing new viral proteins late in the replication cycle.", "solution": "The step to be inhibited is the pH-dependent uncoating that requires an acidic endolysosomal environment. Acidic pH triggers a conformational change in the viral fusion protein that enables the viral envelope to fuse with the endolysosomal membrane, releasing the genome into the cytoplasm. Therefore, the most direct and specific way to block this step is to prevent endosomal/lysosomal acidification so that the fusion protein never reaches the low pH threshold needed for activation.\n\nA lipophilic weak base that accumulates in acidic compartments does exactly this via ion trapping and buffering. For a weak base $B$ in equilibrium $BH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons B + H^{+}$, the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationship\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^{+}]}\\right)\n$$\nshows that when $\\mathrm{pH} < \\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, the protonated form $BH^{+}$ predominates, causing the base to become trapped in the acidic lumen. This sequestration consumes protons and buffers the compartment, raising its $\\mathrm{pH}$ and thereby preventing the low-pH-triggered conformational change of the viral fusion protein. As a result, envelope–endolysosome fusion and genome release are blocked directly at the pH-dependent uncoating step.\n\nApplying this to the options:\n- Option C (Alkalone-4) is a lipophilic weak base that diffuses across membranes, becomes protonated and trapped in lysosomes, and raises their internal $\\mathrm{pH}$. This directly and specifically inhibits the pH-dependent uncoating step.\n- Option A disrupts microtubule-dependent transport but does not specifically target the acid-triggered fusion process.\n- Option B blocks attachment in the extracellular phase, not the endolysosomal pH step.\n- Option D globally halts host translation, which is nonspecific and does not target uncoating.\n- Option E targets a late proteolytic processing step, not the pH-dependent entry/uncoating step.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and specific inhibitor of the described process is Alkalone-4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2301153"}, {"introduction": "Modern cell biology has recast the lysosome from a simple recycling center into a sophisticated signaling platform that integrates environmental cues to direct cell fate. This problem delves into this modern view, focusing on the mTORC1 pathway, a master regulator of cell growth that is activated at the lysosomal surface. Rather than simply memorizing this pathway, this exercise challenges you to think like a cell biologist by designing a live-cell imaging experiment using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to directly visualize and prove this recruitment process, bridging the gap between conceptual knowledge and experimental verification [@problem_id:2301152].", "problem": "The Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a critical protein kinase complex that serves as a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues. A key input for mTORC1 activation is the availability of amino acids. It is hypothesized that in nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 is recruited from the cytoplasm to the cytosolic surface of the lysosome, where its activation sequence is completed.\n\nA cell biologist wants to design an experiment to directly demonstrate this amino-acid-dependent recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface in living cells. The chosen technique is Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a powerful tool for measuring molecular proximity. FRET occurs when a donor fluorophore (in this case, Cyan Fluorescent Protein, or CFP) and an acceptor fluorophore (Yellow Fluorescent Protein, or YFP) are brought within approximately 1-10 nanometers of each other. When the donor is excited by a specific wavelength of light, it can non-radiatively transfer that energy to the nearby acceptor, causing the acceptor to fluoresce. An increase in the FRET signal (measured as an increase in YFP emission upon CFP excitation) indicates that the molecules tagged with CFP and YFP have moved closer together.\n\nThe experiment will involve genetically engineering cells to express fusion proteins. The cells will first be cultured in a medium lacking amino acids (starvation) and then stimulated by the addition of a complete amino acid mixture. The key proteins available for tagging are:\n- mTOR: The catalytic subunit of the mTORC1 complex, which is primarily cytoplasmic in starved cells.\n- Raptor: A core scaffolding component of the mTORC1 complex that is constitutively associated with mTOR.\n- LAMP2: Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2, a protein permanently integrated into the lysosomal membrane, with a portion of the protein facing the cytosol.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs and corresponding expected outcomes would provide direct evidence for the amino-acid-dependent recruitment of the mTORC1 complex to the lysosomal membrane?\n\nA. Co-express Raptor-CFP and mTOR-YFP. The FRET signal is expected to be high and remain largely unchanged upon amino acid addition.\n\nB. Co-express mTOR-CFP and LAMP2-YFP. The FRET signal is expected to increase significantly upon amino acid addition.\n\nC. Co-express mTOR-CFP and LAMP2-YFP. The FRET signal is expected to decrease significantly upon amino acid addition.\n\nD. Co-express LAMP2-CFP and another abundant lysosomal membrane protein, LAMP1-YFP. The FRET signal is expected to increase significantly upon amino acid addition.\n\nE. Co-express mTOR-CFP and a soluble, non-targeted YFP that diffuses freely in the cytoplasm. The FRET signal is expected to increase significantly upon amino acid addition.", "solution": "Goal: directly test whether amino acids recruit the mTORC1 complex (mTOR bound to Raptor) to the cytosolic face of lysosomes. The physical readout is FRET, which reports proximity at nanometer scale. FRET efficiency depends steeply on donor–acceptor distance $r$ according to\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{1+(r/R_{0})^{6}},\n$$\nso an increase in FRET after amino acid addition indicates a decrease in $r$ into the range of the Förster radius $R_{0}$, consistent with recruitment to within a few nanometers.\n\nEstablish the biological premises: Raptor is constitutively associated with mTOR, independent of amino acids. LAMP2 is a resident lysosomal membrane protein with a cytosolic domain. Under starvation, mTORC1 is predominantly cytosolic and not juxtaposed to lysosomal membrane proteins; upon amino acid addition, mTORC1 is recruited to lysosomes, which should reduce the distance $r$ between mTOR and LAMP2.\n\nEvaluate designs against the required causal test (amino acids cause decreased $r$ between mTORC1 and lysosomal membrane):\n\nA. Raptor-CFP with mTOR-YFP measures intra-complex proximity. Because Raptor and mTOR are constitutively bound, $r$ is already small and does not change with amino acids. A high, largely unchanged FRET would validate complex integrity but provides no evidence about lysosomal recruitment. Thus this does not directly test the localization change.\n\nB. mTOR-CFP with LAMP2-YFP directly couples the donor on mTORC1 to the acceptor on the lysosomal membrane. In starvation, $r$ is large, so $E$ is low. Amino acids recruit mTORC1 to lysosomes, decreasing $r$ and increasing $E$, producing a significant rise in YFP emission upon CFP excitation. This is direct evidence for amino-acid-dependent recruitment to lysosomes.\n\nC. The same tagging as in B but expecting a decrease in FRET upon amino acid addition contradicts the recruitment hypothesis; a decrease would imply increased $r$, which is not consistent with mTORC1 moving to lysosomes.\n\nD. LAMP2-CFP with LAMP1-YFP measures proximity between two lysosomal membrane proteins that already share the same membrane under both conditions; $r$ should not systematically decrease upon amino acid addition, so a significant increase in FRET is not expected and would not report on mTORC1 recruitment.\n\nE. mTOR-CFP with a freely diffusing cytosolic YFP lacks spatial specificity. Any change in FRET would reflect nonspecific collision frequencies or concentration changes, not targeted recruitment to lysosomes, and thus does not provide direct evidence of lysosomal localization.\n\nTherefore, only co-expressing mTOR-CFP with LAMP2-YFP and observing a significant FRET increase upon amino acid addition provides direct evidence that amino acids recruit mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2301152"}]}
