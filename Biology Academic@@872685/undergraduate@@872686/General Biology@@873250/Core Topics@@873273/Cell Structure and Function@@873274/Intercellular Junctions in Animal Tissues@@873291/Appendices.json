One of the most direct ways is by sharing small molecules and ions through \"cellular highways\" that connect their interiors. This exercise challenges you to interpret a classic experiment that uses fluorescent dyes of different sizes to reveal the presence and properties of these channels, known as gap junctions [@problem_id:2299231].", "problem": "A team of developmental biologists is studying cell-to-cell communication in the early ectoderm of a *Xenopus laevis* embryo. They microinject a single epithelial cell with a solution containing Lucifer yellow, a water-soluble fluorescent tracer with a molecular weight of approximately 450 Daltons (Da). A kilodalton (kDa) is equal to 1000 Da. Shortly after the injection, they observe using fluorescence microscopy that the dye, which was initially confined to the injected cell, has spread to all of its immediate neighbors and subsequently to the neighbors of those cells, creating a fluorescent patch. A control experiment is performed by injecting a much larger fluorescently-tagged protein (dextran, molecular weight 70 kDa) into a different cell, and in this case, the fluorescence remains confined to the single injected cell.\n\nBased on these observations, what is the most likely type of intercellular junction responsible for the spread of the Lucifer yellow dye?\n\nA. Tight junctions, which form an impermeable barrier between cells.\n\nB. Adherens junctions, which link the actin cytoskeletons of neighboring cells.\n\nC. Desmosomes, which connect the intermediate filament networks of adjacent cells.\n\nD. Gap junctions, which form channels connecting the cytoplasm of adjacent cells.\n\nE. Hemidesmosomes, which anchor cells to the underlying basement membrane.", "solution": "Define $M_{\\mathrm{LY}}$ as the molecular weight of Lucifer yellow and $M_{\\mathrm{DX}}$ as the molecular weight of the fluorescent dextran. From the description, $M_{\\mathrm{LY}} \\approx 450\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{DX}} = 70\\,\\mathrm{kDa} = 70{,}000\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. The observed phenomenon is that the injected Lucifer yellow spreads from the initially injected cell to immediate neighbors and then further to neighbors-of-neighbors, forming a contiguous fluorescent patch, whereas the dextran remains confined to the injected cell.\n\nThe spread of a water-soluble tracer from one cell’s cytoplasm to adjacent cells’ cytoplasm requires a direct cytoplasmic connection that permits diffusion of small solutes. Gap junctions form channels (connexons) that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells and permit passage of ions and small metabolites. A key biophysical property is a size cutoff for permeants: if $M < M_{c}$ (where $M_{c}$ is an effective size/mass cutoff corresponding to the channel pore), then intercellular diffusion occurs; if $M > M_{c}$, diffusion does not occur. Empirically, $M_{c}$ for gap junctions is on the order of approximately $1\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ for many small hydrophilic molecules.\n\nApplying this criterion:\n- Since $M_{\\mathrm{LY}} \\ll M_{c}$, Lucifer yellow can pass through gap junction channels, explaining its spread to neighboring cells and beyond via successive cell-to-cell transfer.\n- Since $M_{\\mathrm{DX}} \\gg M_{c}$, the 70 kDa dextran cannot pass through gap junctions, explaining its confinement to the injected cell.\n\nAlternative junction types are inconsistent with the observations: tight junctions form paracellular diffusion barriers and do not create cytoplasmic continuity; adherens junctions and desmosomes provide mechanical linkage via the actin cytoskeleton and intermediate filaments, respectively, without forming cytoplasmic channels; hemidesmosomes anchor cells to the basement membrane and do not connect adjacent cell cytoplasms. Therefore, the only junction type that accounts for size-selective, cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm transfer of a small dye is gap junctions.\n\nHence, the most likely junction responsible is gap junctions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2299231"}, {"introduction": "Epithelial tissues, like our skin, form robust barriers thanks to powerful adhesive junctions that \"glue\" cells together. This strength isn't magical; it depends on specific molecular interactions and the chemical environment. In this problem, you will predict the outcome of a targeted chemical disruption, exploring the critical role of calcium ions in maintaining the integrity of cadherin-based anchoring junctions [@problem_id:2299296].", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is investigating the molecular basis of tissue structure using a confluent monolayer of epithelial cells grown in a culture dish. These cells form a continuous, tightly connected sheet that serves as a model for a simple tissue. To probe the mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion, the researcher adds a sufficient amount of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to the culture medium. EDTA is a chelating agent that strongly binds and sequesters free divalent cations, particularly calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$), from the extracellular solution.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the immediate and primary consequence for the epithelial monolayer following the addition of EDTA?\n\nA. The cells will lose their connections to each other and dissociate, breaking the monolayer apart into individual cells or small clusters.\n\nB. The barrier function of the monolayer will be compromised, allowing small molecules to pass freely between the cells, but the cells will remain structurally attached to one another.\n\nC. The cells will detach as an intact, continuous sheet from the bottom of the culture dish.\n\nD. Communication between adjacent cells via the direct passage of ions and small signaling molecules will cease, but the overall structure of the monolayer will be unaffected.\n\nE. No significant change will be observed because cell adhesion is primarily dependent on intracellular, not extracellular, calcium concentrations.", "solution": "We identify the key extracellular target of EDTA in an epithelial monolayer: free divalent cations, particularly $Ca^{2+}$, which are required for the function of classical cadherins and desmosomal cadherins (desmogleins/desmocollins) that mediate strong cell-cell adhesion in adherens junctions and desmosomes. Cadherins require bound extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ to maintain their rigid, adhesive conformation and to support homophilic binding.\n\nThe relevant chemical principle is chelation equilibrium. EDTA binds $Ca^{2+}$ with a very large formation (stability) constant, effectively sequestering free $Ca^{2+}$ from solution:\n$$\nCa^{2+} + \\mathrm{EDTA}^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CaEDTA}^{2-}, \\qquad K_{f} \\gg 1.\n$$\nWhen sufficient EDTA is added, the mass-action effect drives complex formation, reducing the free extracellular concentration $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{ext}}$ to a level far below that required to saturate the calcium-binding sites on cadherins. Let $\\theta$ denote the fractional occupancy of the cadherin $Ca^{2+}$-binding sites; in a simple binding model,\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{ext}}}{K_{d} + [Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{ext}}},\n$$\nwhere $K_{d}$ is the dissociation constant for $Ca^{2+}$ at the cadherin binding sites. Chelation by EDTA lowers $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{ext}} \\ll K_{d}$, so $\\theta \\approx 0$, leading to loss of the cadherin rigid conformation and disruption of homophilic adhesion between adjacent cells. Because adherens junctions organize and support tight junctions, and desmosomes also rely on cadherin-family proteins that are $Ca^{2+}$-dependent, the immediate primary structural consequence is loss of cell-cell adhesion, causing cells to separate from each other into single cells or small clusters.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A asserts loss of cell-cell connections with dissociation. This directly matches the cadherin-dependent mechanism just described and is the immediate, primary effect of $Ca^{2+}$ chelation.\n- B posits barrier compromise but preservation of structural attachment between cells. Although barrier function will be compromised secondary to adherens junction disruption, the claim that cells remain attached contradicts the primary cadherin loss; thus B is inaccurate as an immediate primary description.\n- C posits detachment as an intact sheet from the substrate. That would require preserved cell-cell adhesion with selectively weakened cell-substrate adhesion. EDTA also chelates divalent cations important for integrins, but the most immediate, dominant effect in epithelial monolayers is loss of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion; therefore C is not the primary immediate outcome.\n- D focuses on gap junction communication. Gap junction gating does not exhibit the same immediate dependence on extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ chelation; moreover, this ignores the dominant cadherin effect on structure.\n- E incorrectly claims no significant change and misstates the dependence on extracellular $Ca^{2+}$, which is essential for cadherin function.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the immediate and primary consequence is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2299296"}, {"introduction": "Tight junctions act as gatekeepers, regulating what passes through the narrow space between cells.
