By analyzing a hypothetical mutation, you will explore how the ribosome precisely identifies the correct starting point on an mRNA molecule, a critical step for producing any functional protein. This exercise highlights the fundamental role of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the 16S rRNA in the initiation of prokaryotic translation. [@problem_id:2313456]", "problem": "In a laboratory study of prokaryotic gene expression, a researcher creates a mutant strain of *Escherichia coli*. This mutation is located in the gene encoding the $16\\text{S}$ ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a key structural and functional component of the small ($30\\text{S}$) ribosomal subunit. Further analysis reveals that the mutation specifically alters the nucleotide sequence at the 3' end of the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA molecule. This change completely abolishes its ability to base-pair with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence found on messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. However, the mutation does not affect the overall folding of the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA, and functional $30\\text{S}$ and $50\\text{S}$ ribosomal subunits are still produced and can associate to form $70\\text{S}$ ribosomes.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, what is the most direct and significant consequence for protein synthesis in this mutant *E. coli* strain?\n\nA. Protein synthesis rates will decrease slightly, as the ribosome will take longer to scan for the AUG start codon without the Shine-Dalgarno interaction.\n\nB. The elongation phase of translation will be blocked because the peptidyl transferase center in the $50\\text{S}$ subunit will be rendered non-functional.\n\nC. The $30\\text{S}$ ribosomal subunit will fail to correctly position itself on mRNA transcripts, thereby preventing the proper initiation of translation.\n\nD. Assembled $70\\text{S}$ ribosomes will translate the mRNA but will be unable to recognize stop codons, leading to the production of excessively long, non-functional proteins.\n\nE. The fidelity of translation will be compromised, causing a high frequency of incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into growing polypeptide chains.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the effect of a specific mutation in the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA of *E. coli* on protein synthesis. The key information is that the mutation prevents the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA from binding to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on mRNA, but does not prevent the assembly of the ribosomal subunits.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the normal process of translation initiation in prokaryotes.**\nIn prokaryotes like *E. coli*, translation initiation is a highly regulated process that ensures protein synthesis starts at the correct location on an mRNA molecule. The process begins when the small ($30\\text{S}$) ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA. This binding is not random; it is guided by a specific interaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the role of the 16S rRNA and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.**\nThe $30\\text{S}$ ribosomal subunit contains the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA molecule. Near the 3' end of this $16\\text{S}$ rRNA is a nucleotide sequence known as the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence. This sequence is complementary to a specific sequence on the mRNA called the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, which is typically located 5-10 nucleotides upstream of the AUG start codon. The base-pairing interaction between the anti-SD sequence on the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA and the SD sequence on the mRNA serves as an anchor. This interaction correctly positions the $30\\text{S}$ subunit on the mRNA such that the start codon (AUG) is placed precisely in the P (peptidyl) site of the ribosome, ready for the initiator tRNA (fMet-tRNA) to bind.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the effect of the described mutation.**\nThe problem states that the mutation in the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA \"completely abolishes its ability to base-pair with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.\" This means the crucial anchoring interaction described in Step 2 cannot occur. Without this interaction, the $30\\text{S}$ subunit has no mechanism to recognize and bind stably to the correct starting point for translation on the mRNA.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the consequences for the stages of protein synthesis.**\nSince the $30\\text{S}$ subunit cannot be positioned correctly, the initiation complex (consisting of the $30\\text{S}$ subunit, mRNA, and initiator tRNA) cannot form properly at the start codon. Consequently, the large ($50\\text{S}$) subunit cannot be recruited to form the complete, functional $70\\text{S}$ ribosome at the correct site. The entire process of translation is therefore blocked at its very first step: initiation.\n\n**Step 5: Assess the given options based on this analysis.**\n- **A. Protein synthesis rates will decrease slightly, as the ribosome will take longer to scan for the AUG start codon without the Shine-Dalgarno interaction.** This is an understatement of the effect. The SD interaction is not just a facilitator for speed; it is the primary mechanism for recognition. Without it, initiation is not just slower, it is effectively prevented.\n- **B. The elongation phase of translation will be blocked because the peptidyl transferase center in the 50S subunit will be rendered non-functional.** This is incorrect. The mutation is in the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA of the $30\\text{S}$ subunit and affects initiation. The peptidyl transferase center is in the $50\\text{S}$ subunit and is involved in elongation. The problem states the subunits themselves are functional, and translation never reaches the elongation stage anyway.\n- **C. The 30S ribosomal subunit will fail to correctly position itself on mRNA transcripts, thereby preventing the proper initiation of translation.** This is the correct and most direct consequence. The loss of the SD interaction means the $30\\text{S}$ subunit cannot find and bind to the correct starting position, which is the definition of a failure in translation initiation.\n- **D. Assembled 70S ribosomes will translate the mRNA but will be unable to recognize stop codons, leading to the production of excessively long, non-functional proteins.** This is incorrect. The described mutation affects initiation, not termination. Recognition of stop codons involves release factors, not the SD sequence interaction.\n- **E. The fidelity of translation will be compromised, causing a high frequency of incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into growing polypeptide chains.** This is incorrect. While the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA does play a role in decoding fidelity (ensuring correct tRNA-mRNA pairing in the A site) during elongation, the specified mutation affects the SD binding site, which acts during initiation. The primary effect is the failure to start translation, not errors during it.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the outcome is a failure to initiate translation because the small ribosomal subunit cannot locate its binding site on the mRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2313456"}, {"introduction": "After examining how translation begins, let's turn our attention to the final step: termination. This thought experiment simulates the impact of a novel drug that prevents ribosomes from detaching from the mRNA once they reach a stop codon. This scenario will help you visualize protein synthesis as a dynamic, multi-ribosome process and understand the severe consequences of disrupting the carefully orchestrated termination phase. [@problem_id:2313463]", "problem": "In a cellular biology experiment, a researcher is studying protein synthesis in a culture of eukaryotic cells. These cells are actively translating a specific messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule, forming numerous polyribosome complexes. A novel synthetic drug, which we will call \"Terminus-Lock,\" is introduced into the culture. The sole, specific action of Terminus-Lock is to prevent the ribosomal release factor from binding to the ribosome's A-site when a stop codon is encountered. This effectively stalls the ribosome at the very end of the coding sequence without affecting the processes of initiation or elongation.\n\nAssuming the drug is 100% effective and that the experiment runs long enough for multiple ribosomes to initiate translation on each mRNA strand, but not so long that the mRNA molecules themselves degrade, which of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting state of the polyribosome complexes?\n\nA. Protein synthesis rates will dramatically increase as ribosomes are held on the mRNA for longer, allowing for more efficient polypeptide production before disassembly.\n\nB. All polyribosomes will quickly disassemble as initiation of new translation is inhibited by the presence of the drug in the cytoplasm.\n\nC. Ribosomes will complete translation, release the newly synthesized polypeptide, and then accumulate at the 3' end of the mRNA, unable to detach from the transcript.\n\nD. Ribosomes will stall at the stop codon, leading to a \"traffic jam\" where ribosomes accumulate along the length of the mRNA, eventually preventing new ribosomes from binding at the 5' end.\n\nE. Only the first ribosome to reach the stop codon on each mRNA will be affected, stalling permanently, while all subsequent ribosomes will proceed and detach normally, bypassing the stalled ribosome.", "solution": "The biological principle of translation termination in eukaryotes is that when the ribosome encounters a stop codon in the A-site, a release factor (primarily eRF1, assisted by eRF3) binds to the A-site, catalyzes hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site, releases the completed polypeptide, and enables ribosome recycling. Ribosome disassembly and recycling require successful peptide release; thus, release factor binding is essential for clearing the ribosome from the stop codon.\n\nBy premise, Terminus-Lock specifically prevents the ribosomal release factor from binding to the A-site when a stop codon is encountered, without affecting initiation or elongation. Therefore, when a translating ribosome reaches the stop codon, it cannot recruit the release factor, cannot hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA, cannot release the nascent polypeptide, and cannot undergo ribosome recycling. The ribosome consequently stalls at the stop codon at the end of the coding sequence.\n\nBecause initiation and elongation remain unaffected, other ribosomes on the same mRNA continue to initiate at the 5' end and elongate toward the stop codon. Each trailing ribosome progresses until it reaches the physical limit set by the footprint of the stalled ribosome at the stop codon, at which point it too must stall because ribosomes cannot pass one another or occupy overlapping positions on the mRNA. Over time, this produces a queue of ribosomes arrayed along the coding sequence, each halted behind the one in front, with the leading ribosome permanently stalled at the stop codon. As the queue extends backward along the mRNA, it eventually approaches the start region, sterically hindering new initiation events (both by physical occupancy of the start-proximal region and by the inability of newly initiated ribosomes to proceed). Thus, the net effect is a progressive accumulation of ribosomes along the mRNA, culminating in a \"traffic jam\" that eventually blocks further initiation at the 5' end.\n\nThis outcome rules out the other options:\n- A is false because polypeptide release is blocked; no completed proteins are released, and ribosomes are not more efficient but rather sequestered at the stop.\n- B is false because initiation is explicitly unaffected by the drug; polyribosomes will not quickly disassemble, but instead accumulate.\n- C is false because release does not occur; ribosomes do not release the polypeptide and then accumulate—rather, they stall with peptidyl-tRNA still attached, unable to detach.\n- E is false because every ribosome that reaches the stop codon encounters the same block; none can bypass a stalled ribosome or proceed to termination.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that ribosomes stall at the stop codon, creating a ribosome queue that expands to block initiation at the 5' end.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2313463"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice puts you in the role of a molecular biologist designing a crucial experiment.

Each reaction contains a standard mix of bacterial ribosomes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), amino acids, and the necessary enzymatic factors for protein synthesis.

The amino acid pool includes ${}^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine, which is incorporated as the initiating residue and also at internal methionine codons. Thus, any peptide that has incorporated at least the initiating methionine will be radioactive and visible on autoradiography after gel electrophoresis.\n\nControl (no antibiotic): Translation proceeds through initiation, elongation, and termination to yield the full-length product of $200$ amino acids. Because the product contains the initiating methionine (and additional internal methionines), a strong, distinct band at the full-length size (corresponding to $200$ amino acids) is expected.\n\nTest P (Compound P inhibits initiation): An initiation inhibitor blocks formation of the initiation complex on the mRNA, preventing the incorporation of the initiating methionine into nascent chains. With initiation blocked from the start, essentially no new polypeptide chains are synthesized.
