This thought experiment [@problem_id:2341578] explores the role of the N-terminal signal peptide, which acts as a molecular \"entry ticket\" into this intricate network. By considering what happens when this ticket is rendered non-functional, you can solidify your understanding of the fundamental rule governing entry into the secretory pathway.", "problem": "A biotechnology research team is engineering a eukaryotic cell line to produce and secrete a therapeutic protein called \"Protease-A\". The gene for Protease-A includes a standard N-terminal signal sequence that directs the newly synthesized protein into the secretory pathway, beginning at the endoplasmic reticulum. For the protein to be secreted, it must successfully enter this pathway.\n\nDuring a routine production run, the team discovers that while the cells are producing functional Protease-A at the expected rate, none of the protein is being secreted into the extracellular medium. A genetic analysis of this cell batch reveals a single, specific mutation in the Protease-A gene. This mutation has altered the coding sequence for the N-terminal signal peptide, rendering it completely non-functional. The mutation does not affect the translation, folding, or enzymatic activity of the rest of the Protease-A protein.\n\nAssuming all other cellular machinery for protein synthesis and transport is functioning correctly, where would the fully synthesized Protease-A protein molecules be expected to predominantly accumulate within these mutant cells?\n\nA. In the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum\n\nB. In the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus\n\nC. In the cytosol\n\nD. In secretory vesicles awaiting exocytosis\n\nE. In the extracellular medium, but in a misfolded state", "solution": "- Secretory pathway entry in eukaryotic cells requires an N-terminal signal peptide on the nascent polypeptide to be recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it engages the Sec61 translocon. Translation then resumes with co-translational translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen, after which the signal peptide is typically cleaved. From there, proteins proceed ER lumen → Golgi apparatus → secretory vesicles → extracellular space.\n\n- If the N-terminal signal peptide is non-functional, SRP cannot recognize or bind the nascent chain. Consequently, the ribosome does not dock at the ER, and translation proceeds to completion on free ribosomes in the cytosol. In the absence of any other targeting signals (e.g., nuclear localization sequence, mitochondrial targeting signal, or peroxisomal targeting signal), the default localization of the fully synthesized protein is the cytosol.\n\n- The problem states: the only mutation renders the N-terminal signal peptide non-functional, while translation, folding, and enzymatic activity of the rest of the protein are unaffected, and all other cellular machinery is intact. Therefore, the protein will not enter the ER and thus cannot reach the Golgi, secretory vesicles, or extracellular space.\n\n- Evaluating options:\n  A. In the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum: requires a functional signal peptide and SRP-mediated targeting; not possible.\n  B. In the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus: requires prior ER entry; not possible.\n  C. In the cytosol: default localization when no functional ER signal peptide is present; expected outcome.\n  D. In secretory vesicles awaiting exocytosis: requires ER and Golgi transit; not possible.\n  E. In the extracellular medium, but in a misfolded state: secretion cannot occur without ER entry; misfolding is not implicated by the mutation.\n\n- Therefore, the fully synthesized Protease-A will predominantly accumulate in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341578"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein enters the secretory pathway, it is not destined to wander aimlessly. The Golgi apparatus acts as a central sorting station, using specific molecular tags to direct proteins to their correct final destinations. This practice problem [@problem_id:2319019] investigates the fate of lysosomal enzymes when their mannose-6-phosphate ($M6P$) \"zip code\" is missing, beautifully illustrating the concept of a default pathway in the absence of a specific sorting signal.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the endomembrane system is responsible for synthesizing, modifying, and trafficking proteins and lipids. Lysosomes, a key component of this system, function as the cell's waste disposal and recycling centers. They contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, collectively known as acid hydrolases, which are active at the acidic pH maintained within the lysosome.\n\nThe journey of a lysosomal hydrolase begins on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, after which it travels to the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, these enzymes are specifically tagged with a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) marker. This M6P tag acts as a molecular \"zip code,\" ensuring that the hydrolases are sorted into vesicles that deliver them to the lysosomes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a cell line has a genetic defect that inactivates the enzyme responsible for adding the mannose-6-phosphate tag to proteins within the Golgi apparatus. What is the most likely ultimate fate of the newly synthesized, but untagged, lysosomal hydrolase enzymes in this cell line?\n\nA. They will be packaged into secretory vesicles and released into the extracellular space.\n\nB. They will accumulate indefinitely within the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nC. They will be transported into the cytoplasm and degraded by proteasomes.\n\nD. They will be mistakenly returned to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nE. They will be found freely diffused and inactive in the cell's cytoplasm.", "solution": "The relevant trafficking principle is that soluble lysosomal hydrolases are sorted in the trans-Golgi network by binding to the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor after receiving an M6P tag in the Golgi. This tag is added by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase; without it, the hydrolases cannot be recognized by the M6P receptor and thus cannot be directed into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for late endosomes and lysosomes.\n\nNormally, lysosomal hydrolases:\n1) Are synthesized into the rough endoplasmic reticulum lumen via an N-terminal signal sequence and properly folded and glycosylated.\n2) Transit to the Golgi, where the phosphotransferase adds the M6P tag.\n3) Bind the M6P receptor in the trans-Golgi network, are packaged into vesicles, delivered to endosomes, and ultimately to lysosomes.\n\nIn the genetic defect described (loss of the enzyme that adds M6P), the hydrolases reach the Golgi but lack the M6P address tag. Without this tag, they fail to bind the M6P receptor and are not sorted into lysosome-directed vesicles. The default pathway for soluble proteins in the Golgi lumen that lack specific retention or retrieval signals is constitutive secretion. Therefore, these untagged lysosomal enzymes are packaged into secretory vesicles and released extracellularly.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- They do not accumulate indefinitely in Golgi cisternae because the secretory pathway provides a default exit (reject B).\n- They are not transported to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation; that pathway applies to misfolded ER proteins via ER-associated degradation, not properly folded Golgi cargo (reject C).\n- They are not returned to the ER; ER retrieval requires signals such as KDEL for soluble proteins, which lysosomal hydrolases do not carry (reject D).\n- They cannot freely diffuse in the cytoplasm due to membrane barriers; they remain within the endomembrane lumen unless secreted (reject E).\n\nThus, the most likely fate is constitutive secretion to the extracellular space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2319019"}, {"introduction": "The endomembrane system is not just a series of pathways; it is a dynamic factory that actively builds and expands the cell. This exercise [@problem_id:2319052] transitions from qualitative concepts to quantitative analysis, challenging you to calculate the physical amount of new membrane required for a cell to grow and divide.
