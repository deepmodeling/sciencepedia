However, protrusion is not a simple matter of uncontrolled actin polymerization. This exercise [@problem_id:2318454] invites you to think like a cell biologist, using a hypothetical inhibitor to dissect how different molecular machines, the Arp2/3 complex and formins, sculpt distinct actin architectures to produce either broad lamellipodia or sharp filopodia.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanisms of cell migration in fibroblasts. The leading edge of a migrating fibroblast typically extends broad, sheet-like protrusions known as lamellipodia, which are driven by the polymerization of a dense, branched network of actin filaments. This branching is primarily initiated by the Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, which nucleates new actin filaments at a characteristic 70-degree angle from the side of an existing filament.\n\nThe biologist treats a culture of fibroblasts with a highly specific inhibitor that completely blocks the nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex but does not affect other proteins involved in actin dynamics, such as formins (which promote the growth of long, unbranched filaments) or actin-bundling proteins. After incubation with the inhibitor, the biologist observes the cell periphery to see how the protrusive structures have changed.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most direct and likely consequence of inhibiting the Arp2/3 complex in these cells?\n\nA. The cells will form larger and more stable lamellipodia due to compensatory mechanisms.\n\nB. The cells will exhibit a dramatic increase in the formation of filopodia, which are thin, finger-like protrusions composed of parallel bundles of long actin filaments.\n\nC. The entire actin cytoskeleton will depolymerize, causing the cell to become spherical and detach from the substrate.\n\nD. The rate of actin filament treadmilling will increase significantly, but the overall structure of the leading edge will remain unchanged.\n\nE. The microtubule network will reorganize to form the primary protrusive structures at the cell's leading edge.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the core roles of actin assembly machineries at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. Lamellipodia are driven by a dense, branched network of actin filaments. The key nucleator of these branched networks is the Arp2/3 complex, which generates daughter filaments from the sides of existing filaments to create a dendritic array. This dendritic network underlies the broad, sheet-like protrusive structure of lamellipodia.\n\nIf the nucleating activity of Arp2/3 is completely inhibited, the cell can no longer build the branched network required for lamellipodial extension. Therefore, lamellipodia do not get larger or more stable; instead, they are diminished or lost, which rules out option A.\n\nThe problem specifies that formins and actin-bundling proteins remain active. Formins promote the elongation of long, unbranched actin filaments, and bundling proteins (such as fascin) can crosslink these filaments into tight, parallel bundles. These parallel bundles are the hallmark of filopodia, the thin, finger-like protrusions. In the absence of Arp2/3-driven branching, formin-mediated elongation and bundling become comparatively dominant at the leading edge, favoring the formation of filopodia. Thus, the most direct and likely observable consequence is an increase in filopodia formation, supporting option B.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the actin cytoskeleton will not globally depolymerize; actin polymerization persists via formins, and other actin structures (e.g., stress fibers) remain. Option D is incorrect because blocking a major nucleator does not increase treadmilling at the leading edge; moreover, the architecture of the leading edge must change due to loss of dendritic branching. Option E is incorrect because microtubules do not replace actin as the principal protrusive machinery at the leading edge; while microtubules contribute to polarity and trafficking, they do not drive lamellipodial protrusion.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and likely outcome is an increase in filopodia as formin-driven, bundled actin filaments predominate when Arp2/3 is inhibited.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2318454"}, {"introduction": "Microtubules form the primary transport network within cells, acting as polarized tracks for motor proteins. This organization is particularly striking in neurons, where cargo must be moved over vast distances. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2352693] presents a puzzle: based on the observed movement of a novel motor protein, you must deduce both the motor's intrinsic directionality and the fundamental difference in microtubule organization between axons and dendrites, revealing a key principle of neuronal cell biology.", "problem": "In a neuroscience laboratory, a research team is studying intracellular transport in cultured mammalian neurons. They identify a novel motor protein, which they name \"AxoDendro Mover\" (ADM), responsible for transporting vesicles filled with essential metabolic enzymes. To characterize its function, they attach a fluorescent tag to ADM and use live-cell imaging to track the net direction of vesicle movement within different neuronal compartments.\n\nTheir observations are as follows:\n1.  In axons, all observed vesicles containing ADM consistently move from the region near the cell body towards the axon terminal.\n2.  In dendrites, they observe two distinct populations of ADM-containing vesicles. Approximately half of the vesicles move from the cell body towards the dendritic tips, while the other half move from the dendritic tips back towards the cell body.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume that a motor protein can only move in one direction relative to microtubule polarity: either towards the plus-end (a \"plus-end directed\" motor) or towards the minus-end (a \"minus-end directed\" motor).\n\nBased on these experimental observations, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the ADM protein and the underlying microtubule organization in neurons?\n\nA. ADM is a plus-end directed motor, and microtubules have a uniform polarity (all plus-ends pointing away from the cell body) in both axons and dendrites.\n\nB. ADM is a minus-end directed motor, and microtubules have a uniform polarity (all plus-ends pointing away from the cell body) in both axons and dendrites.\n\nC. ADM is a plus-end directed motor; microtubules in axons have a uniform polarity (plus-ends out), while microtubules in dendrites have a mixed polarity.\n\nD. ADM is a minus-end directed motor; microtubules in axons have a uniform polarity (plus-ends out), while microtubules in dendrites have a mixed polarity.\n\nE. The observations are contradictory, as a single type of motor protein cannot produce bidirectional movement within the same cellular compartment.", "solution": "The problem requires us to deduce the properties of the motor protein \"AxoDendro Mover\" (ADM) and the structure of the microtubule cytoskeleton in axons and dendrites by interpreting experimental data on vesicle transport.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the observation in the axon. The problem states that in axons, all vesicles with ADM move from the cell body towards the axon terminal. This direction of transport, away from the cell body, is known as anterograde transport. In vertebrate neurons, the axonal cytoskeleton is characterized by a highly organized array of microtubules. These microtubules are uniformly oriented such that their plus-ends point away from the cell body (distally, towards the axon terminal) and their minus-ends point towards the cell body (proximally). Since the ADM-driven vesicles move towards the axon terminal, they must be moving along the microtubules towards their plus-ends. Therefore, we can conclude that ADM is a plus-end directed motor protein.\n\nNext, let's analyze the observation in the dendrites. The problem states that two populations of vesicles are observed: one moving away from the cell body and another moving towards the cell body. We have already established from the axonal data that ADM is a plus-end directed motor. A plus-end directed motor will always move towards the plus-end of the microtubule track it is on. The observation of movement both away from and towards the cell body, driven by the same unidirectional motor protein, can only be explained if the underlying microtubule tracks are themselves oriented in two different directions. This implies that in dendrites, some microtubules have their plus-ends pointing away from the cell body, while others have their plus-ends pointing towards the cell body. This arrangement is known as mixed polarity.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the given options based on our conclusions:\n-   ADM is a plus-end directed motor.\n-   Axons have microtubules with uniform plus-end-out polarity.\n-   Dendrites have microtubules with mixed polarity.\n\nA. ADM is a plus-end directed motor, and microtubules have a uniform polarity (all plus-ends pointing away from the cell body) in both axons and dendrites. This is incorrect because uniform polarity in dendrites would not allow for the observed bidirectional movement towards and away from the cell body.\n\nB. ADM is a minus-end directed motor, and microtubules have a uniform polarity (all plus-ends pointing away from the cell body) in both axons and dendrites. This is incorrect because if ADM were a minus-end motor, it would move towards the cell body in axons, which contradicts the observation.\n\nC. ADM is a plus-end directed motor; microtubules in axons have a uniform polarity (plus-ends out), while microtubules in dendrites have a mixed polarity. This statement is fully consistent with both of our deductions. The motor's nature explains the axon transport direction, and the combination of the motor's nature and the dendritic microtubule structure explains the bidirectional transport in dendrites.\n\nD. ADM is a minus-end directed motor; microtubules in axons have a uniform polarity (plus-ends out), while microtubules in dendrites have a mixed polarity. This is incorrect because it misidentifies ADM as a minus-end directed motor.\n\nE. The observations are contradictory, as a single type of motor protein cannot produce bidirectional movement within the same cellular compartment. This is incorrect. The observations are not contradictory; they are a classic demonstration of how a unidirectional motor can produce bidirectional net transport if the tracks it runs on have mixed polarity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2352693"}, {"introduction": "The formation of the mitotic spindle is a hallmark of cell division, but is the mere presence of this microtubule-based structure sufficient for chromosome segregation? This practice problem [@problem_id:2318441] explores the concept of 'dynamic instability' in a critical functional context.

The drug's mechanism of action is highly specific: it binds to the αβ-tubulin dimer and completely prevents the hydrolysis of its bound Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) into Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP), without affecting the ability of GTP-bound tubulin to polymerize. The researcher introduces Dynastatin into a culture of rapidly proliferating human cancer cells. Based on your understanding of the cytoskeleton and the cell cycle, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and predictable consequence for these cells?\n\nA. The cells will be unable to form a mitotic spindle, arresting them in prophase.\n\nB.

The cells will experience a complete and rapid disassembly of all existing microtubules, leading to a collapse of cell structure.\n\nE. The cells will be arrested in the S phase of the cell cycle because DNA replication requires microtubule dynamics.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely consequence of a drug that prevents GTP hydrolysis on tubulin dimers in rapidly dividing cells. To determine the outcome, we must first understand the role of GTP in microtubule dynamics and then relate that to the process of mitosis.\n\n1.  **Microtubule Dynamics and the Role of GTP:** Microtubules are polymers composed of αβ-tubulin dimers. Their assembly and disassembly are a highly dynamic process known as \"dynamic instability.\"\n    - **Polymerization (Growth):** Tubulin dimers with GTP bound to the β-tubulin subunit have a high affinity for the plus-end of an existing microtubule. Their addition causes the microtubule to grow. This creates a \"GTP cap\" at the growing end.\n    - **Hydrolysis:** Shortly after a tubulin dimer is incorporated into the microtubule lattice, its bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Tubulin-GDP has a weaker affinity for its neighbors in the polymer.\n    - **Depolymerization (Catastrophe):** If the rate of GTP hydrolysis at the plus-end surpasses the rate of addition of new GTP-tubulin dimers, the stabilizing GTP cap is lost. The microtubule end now consists of GDP-tubulin, which is conformationally strained and prone to rapid disassembly. This switch from growth to rapid shrinkage is called a catastrophe.\n\n2.  **Effect of the Drug \"Dynastatin\":** The drug prevents the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP on the tubulin dimers.\n    - This means that even after being incorporated into a microtubule, the tubulin dimers remain in their GTP-bound state.\n    - The GTP-bound state promotes stability and polymerization. By preventing the formation of GDP-tubulin, the drug effectively eliminates the trigger for catastrophe.\n    - Therefore, the microtubules will become hyper-stabilized. They can still grow, but they will lose their ability to shrink or depolymerize. Dynamic instability will be suppressed.\n\n3.  **Consequences for Mitosis:** The process of mitosis is critically dependent on the dynamic instability of microtubules, which form the mitotic spindle.\n    - **Spindle Formation:** In prophase and prometaphase, microtubules grow and shrink rapidly from the centrosomes to \"search for\" and \"capture\" the kinetochores on chromosomes.\n    - **Chromosome Alignment:** During metaphase, the proper alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate requires the generation of tension. This tension is created by the opposing pulling and pushing forces of dynamic microtubules connected to the kinetochores. Microtubules must be able to grow and shrink to correct improper attachments and to congress all chromosomes to the cell's equator.\n    - **Chromosome Segregation:** During anaphase, sister chromatids are pulled apart. This process has two components: Anaphase A, where the kinetochore microtubules shorten (depolymerize) to pull the chromatids toward the spindle poles, and Anaphase B, where the poles themselves move apart.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options in the Context of Dynastatin's Effect:**\n    - Since Dynastatin stabilizes microtubules and prevents their depolymerization, the mitotic spindle will be non-functional. Although microtubules can polymerize to form a spindle-like structure, this structure will be static and rigid. It cannot perform the dynamic \"search and capture\" efficiently, it cannot generate the necessary tension to satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint, and it cannot depolymerize during Anaphase A to pull the chromatids apart.\n    - This leads to a mitotic arrest. The cell detects that the chromosomes are not properly aligned and under tension, and the spindle assembly checkpoint is activated, preventing the cell from proceeding to anaphase.\n\n    - **A. The cells will be unable to form a mitotic spindle, arresting them in prophase.** This is incorrect. The drug stabilizes microtubules, so polymerization and assembly are not inhibited; in fact, they are promoted. A spindle will form, but it will be a defective, static one. This option describes the effect of drugs like colchicine, which prevent polymerization.\n    - **B. The cells will complete mitosis but will be unable to undergo cytokinesis, resulting in large, multinucleated cells.** This is incorrect. The primary block will occur during mitosis itself due to the failure of chromosome segregation. The cell will likely arrest and be unable to complete mitosis long before cytokinesis begins.\n    - **C. The cells will be arrested in mitosis with a fully formed but non-functional spindle that is incapable of segregating chromosomes.** This is the correct description. A spindle forms, but its lack of dynamic instability makes it non-functional, halting the cell cycle in mitosis (specifically, a metaphase-like arrest).\n    - **D. The cells will experience a complete and rapid disassembly of all existing microtubules, leading to a collapse of cell structure.** This is the opposite of the drug's effect. The drug stabilizes, rather than destabilizes, microtubules.\n    - **E. The cells will be arrested in the S phase of the cell cycle because DNA replication requires microtubule dynamics.** This is incorrect. The primary role of microtubules is in M phase (mitosis) and in maintaining cell shape/transport during interphase. DNA replication (S phase) is not directly dependent on microtubule dynamics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2318441"}]}
