{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly understand a complex system like the *lac* operon, scientists often study mutants to isolate and observe individual components. This first exercise explores a scenario where the negative control circuit is disabled by a mutation in the repressor gene. By removing the repressor's influence, we can clearly see how the second layer of regulation—positive control by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP)—dictates the operon's expression level in response to the cell's energy status [@problem_id:2312348].", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the enzymes required for lactose metabolism are encoded by the structural genes of the *lac* operon (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*). The expression of this operon is tightly regulated by two interconnected mechanisms. First, a negative control mechanism involves the *lacI* gene, which codes for a repressor protein. In the absence of lactose, this repressor binds to a DNA sequence called the operator, physically blocking transcription. When lactose is present, it is converted into an inducer molecule (allolactose) that binds to the repressor, preventing it from binding to the operator. Second, a positive control mechanism, known as catabolite repression, involves the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) and a signaling molecule, cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP). The intracellular concentration of cAMP is inversely related to the availability of glucose; low glucose levels lead to high cAMP levels. The cAMP-CAP complex binds to a site near the promoter and significantly enhances the recruitment of RNA polymerase, thus activating transcription.\n\nConsider a special mutant strain of *E. coli* with a genotype denoted as $I^-$. This mutation renders the *lacI* gene non-functional, meaning no functional repressor protein is ever produced. A culture of this $I^-$ strain is initially grown in a liquid medium containing a high concentration of glucose and a high concentration of lactose. The culture is then abruptly transferred to a fresh medium containing a very low concentration of glucose but the same high concentration of lactose.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the rate of transcription of the *lac* structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*) just before and just after this transfer?\n\nA. The transcription of the *lac* structural genes is at a high, fully activated level in the initial glucose-rich medium and remains high after the shift to the glucose-poor medium.\n\nB. The transcription of the *lac* structural genes is at a low, basal level in the initial glucose-rich medium, and it increases to a high, fully activated level after the shift to the glucose-poor medium.\n\nC. The transcription of the *lac* structural genes is completely repressed (virtually zero) in the initial glucose-rich medium and increases to a high, fully activated level after the shift to the glucose-poor medium.\n\nD. The transcription of the *lac* structural genes is at a high, fully activated level in the initial glucose-rich medium and decreases to a low, basal level after the shift to the glucose-poor medium.\n\nE. The transcription of the *lac* structural genes is completely repressed (virtually zero) in both media because the absence of a functional repressor destabilizes the entire operon.", "solution": "We analyze regulation of the *lac* operon by combining its two controls: negative control by the LacI repressor and positive control by the CAP–cAMP activator.\n\n1) Negative control principle: In wild-type, the product of the *lacI* gene (LacI repressor) binds the operator to block RNA polymerase. The inducer (allolactose) binds LacI to prevent operator binding. In the $I^{-}$ mutant, no functional repressor is produced. Therefore, the operator is never blocked, regardless of lactose presence. Conclusion: in $I^{-}$, repression is absent; transcription is constitutive with respect to the repressor and inducer.\n\n2) Positive control principle (catabolite repression): The CAP–cAMP complex activates transcription by binding near the promoter and enhancing RNA polymerase recruitment. Intracellular $[\\text{cAMP}]$ is inversely related to glucose. Thus:\n- High glucose implies low $[\\text{cAMP}]$, CAP is not in the activating complex at the promoter, so no activation; transcription remains at a low, basal level if not repressed.\n- Low glucose implies high $[\\text{cAMP}]$, CAP–cAMP binds and activates, yielding high (fully activated) transcription if repression is absent.\n\n3) Apply to the conditions:\n- Initial medium: high glucose and high lactose. In $I^{-}$, there is no repressor, so the operator is free. However, high glucose means low $[\\text{cAMP}]$, so CAP–cAMP does not activate. Therefore, transcription occurs at a low, basal level (no repression, no activation).\n- After transfer: very low glucose and high lactose. In $I^{-}$, repression remains absent. Very low glucose raises $[\\text{cAMP}]$, forming CAP–cAMP that binds and activates transcription. Therefore, transcription increases to a high, fully activated level.\n\n4) The presence of high lactose does not alter the conclusion in $I^{-}$, because there is no repressor to inactivate; activation state is determined by glucose via cAMP.\n\nTherefore, transcription is low (basal) before the transfer and high (fully activated) after the transfer, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2312348"}, {"introduction": "The groundbreaking work on the operon model by François Jacob and Jacques Monod heavily relied on partial diploid cells, or merodiploids. These are cells containing a second copy of the *lac* operon on a plasmid, and they are invaluable for genetic dissection. This practice challenges you to predict the phenotype of a merodiploid, forcing you to distinguish between *trans*-acting elements (diffusible proteins like the repressor) and *cis*-acting elements (DNA sites like the operator) and to apply principles of genetic dominance [@problem_id:2312375].", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the metabolism of lactose is controlled by the *lac* operon. This system includes several key components: the regulatory gene *I*, the promoter *P*, the operator *O*, and the structural genes *Z* (encoding $\\beta$-galactosidase) and *Y* (encoding lactose permease). The protein products of the *I* gene act as repressors that can bind to the operator *O* to regulate transcription.\n\nConsider a special strain of *E. coli* that is a partial diploid, also known as a merodiploid.

Thus, at any $O^{+}$ copy, repression is maintained despite the presence of inducer. Therefore, $I^{s}$ functionally dominates at $O^{+}$.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the chromosome ($O^{+} Z^{+} Y^{-}$).\n- Operator is $O^{+}$, so it is repressible. In the presence of $I^{s}$, this operon is repressed in both the absence and presence of lactose.\n- Consequence: $Z^{+}$ is not transcribed, so no functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced from this copy; $Y^{-}$ is nonfunctional even if expressed, so it contributes no permease.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the F' plasmid ($O^{c} Z^{-} Y^{+}$).\n- Operator is $O^{c}$, which cannot bind repressor; transcription is constitutive in cis regardless of $I^{s}$ or lactose.\n- Consequence: $Z^{-}$ is nonfunctional even though it is transcribed constitutively, so no functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced from this copy; $Y^{+}$ is functional and expressed constitutively, producing permease continuously.\n\nStep 4: Combine outputs and determine phenotype with and without lactose.\n- $\\beta$-galactosidase: Chromosome $Z^{+}$ is silenced by $I^{s}$ at $O^{+}$ under all conditions; plasmid $Z^{-}$ is nonfunctional.

The *trp* operon features an additional, elegant layer of control called attenuation, which is tightly coupled to the process of translation. This final exercise explores a thought experiment where genetic engineering has rewired the attenuation \"sensor,\" providing deep insight into how the cell monitors amino acid availability to fine-tune gene expression [@problem_id:2312359].", "problem": "In *Escherichia coli*, the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon. This operon employs a dual-control mechanism involving a repressor protein and a process called attenuation. Attenuation occurs at a leader sequence (*trpL*), located upstream of the operon's structural genes. The mRNA transcribed from this leader sequence contains a short open reading frame which includes two adjacent tryptophan (Trp) codons. The leader mRNA also contains four regions (1, 2, 3, and 4) that can form alternative stem-loop structures. When Trp is scarce, ribosomes translating the leader peptide stall at the Trp codons (located in region 1). This stalling allows region 2 and region 3 of the mRNA to form an \"anti-terminator\" stem-loop, permitting RNA polymerase to continue transcribing the structural genes. Conversely, when Trp is abundant, the ribosome translates the leader peptide quickly, which facilitates the formation of a \"terminator\" stem-loop between regions 3 and 4, causing premature termination of transcription.\n\nNow, consider a genetically engineered mutant *E. coli* strain with two specific modifications:\n1. The gene for the Trp repressor protein (*trpR*) has been deleted, rendering the primary repressor-operator regulatory system non-functional.\n2. In the *trpL* leader sequence, the two adjacent tryptophan codons have been replaced by two adjacent isoleucine (Ile) codons.\n\nThis mutant strain is cultured in a medium rich in tryptophan but completely lacking in isoleucine. Which of the following statements best describes the expected rate of transcription of the *trp* structural genes (*trpE* through *trpA*) in this mutant under these specific conditions?\n\nA. Transcription will be attenuated to a very low rate because the abundance of tryptophan in the medium ensures rapid translation of the leader peptide.\n\nB. Transcription will proceed at a high, unattenuated rate because the absence of isoleucine causes ribosomes to stall, leading to the formation of the anti-terminator loop.\n\nC. The transcription rate will be at a fixed, intermediate level, as the mutation has uncoupled the attenuation mechanism from regulation by any amino acid.\n\nD. Transcription will be completely halted shortly after initiation because the stalled ribosome on the leader sequence will physically obstruct the progress of RNA polymerase.", "solution": "We identify the two regulatory layers of the *trp* operon and evaluate them under the specified mutations and growth conditions.\n\nFirst, the primary repressor-operator control: deletion of the *trpR* gene abolishes production of the Trp repressor. Without Trp repressor, the operator cannot be occupied and RNA polymerase can initiate transcription regardless of tryptophan levels. Therefore, repression does not occur in this mutant, even in tryptophan-rich medium.\n\nSecond, attenuation at the leader sequence *trpL*: attenuation depends on the coupling between transcription and translation of the leader peptide, which determines which RNA secondary structure forms between regions 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the wild type, two adjacent Trp codons in region 1 allow the leader ribosome to sense charged $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Trp}}$ availability. When Trp is scarce, ribosome stalling at these codons leaves region 2 free to pair with region 3, forming the 2-3 anti-terminator and allowing RNA polymerase to read through into the *trpE*–*trpA* genes. When Trp is abundant, the ribosome rapidly translates through region 1 into region 2, preventing 2-3 pairing and enabling the 3-4 terminator hairpin, which attenuates transcription.\n\nIn the mutant, the two Trp codons are replaced by two Ile codons. This rewires the attenuation sensor to isoleucine availability instead of tryptophan. In a medium completely lacking isoleucine, the leader ribosome stalls at the Ile codons in region 1 due to the absence of charged $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$. This stalling leaves region 2 available to base-pair with region 3, forming the anti-terminator (2-3) and preventing formation of the 3-4 terminator. Consequently, transcription by RNA polymerase proceeds past the attenuator into the structural genes at a high, unattenuated rate.\n\nThe abundance of tryptophan does not restore attenuation here because the decisive step is leader translation at the modified Ile codons, not at Trp codons. The stalled ribosome in region 1 does not physically block RNA polymerase; instead, it promotes anti-terminator formation that favors transcriptional readthrough. Therefore, with repression disabled and attenuation relieved by Ile starvation, the operon is transcribed at a high rate.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that transcription will proceed at a high, unattenuated rate because the absence of isoleucine causes ribosomes to stall, leading to the formation of the anti-terminator loop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2312359"}]}
