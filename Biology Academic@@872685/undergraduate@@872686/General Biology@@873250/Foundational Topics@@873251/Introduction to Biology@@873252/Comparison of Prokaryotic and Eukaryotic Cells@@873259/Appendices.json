{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The most obvious difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is size, but this is also one of the most profound. This exercise explores the physical limitations imposed by size, using a fundamental principle of physics—diffusion. By calculating the time it takes for a molecule to travel within a small prokaryote versus a large eukaryote, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for why the evolution of larger cells necessitated the development of complex internal transport systems and compartmentalization [@problem_id:2288081].", "problem": "To understand the physical constraints that shape cellular architecture, consider the process of passive diffusion within a cell. We will model a typical prokaryotic cell and a typical eukaryotic cell as simple spheres. The prokaryotic cell has a diameter of $1.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, while the eukaryotic cell has a diameter of $20\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nA small molecule, such as glucose, must travel from the cell membrane to various locations within the cell to be utilized. The characteristic time for a molecule to diffuse across a certain distance is a key factor in the efficiency of cellular processes. Assume the cytoplasm in both cells has a consistency such that the diffusion coefficient for this small molecule is $D = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$.\n\nCalculate the approximate time it would take for the molecule to diffuse from the cell periphery (membrane) to the cell's geometric center for both the prokaryote and the eukaryote. Based on your calculations, select the option below that presents the correct approximate times and the most accurate biological conclusion. For the purposes of this problem, the time values presented in the options have been rounded to two significant figures.\n\nA. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$. The substantial increase in diffusion time for the eukaryote suggests that passive diffusion is too slow to support the metabolic needs of a large cell, necessitating the evolution of active intracellular transport systems.\n\nB. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $0.050\\ \\text{s}$. The diffusion time scales linearly with cell radius, so the 20-fold increase in radius leads to a 20-fold increase in time, a manageable difference that does not require specialized transport.\n\nC. Prokaryote: $5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $0.20\\ \\text{s}$. The much longer diffusion time in eukaryotes is primarily due to their more structured and dense cytoplasm, which increases the effective diffusion distance.\n\nD. Prokaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$. The faster diffusion in eukaryotes demonstrates that their complex endomembrane system creates efficient channels for molecular transport, making them superior to prokaryotes.\n\nE. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$. On a biological timescale, these two durations are functionally equivalent. Therefore, active transport systems in eukaryotes must have evolved for purposes other than overcoming diffusion limitations, such as targeted delivery to specific organelles.", "solution": "The characteristic diffusive time across a distance is estimated from the mean-square displacement relation for diffusion. For motion along one coordinate (appropriate for a radial estimate from membrane to center), the relation is $\\langle x^{2} \\rangle = 2 D t$, giving a characteristic time\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{L^{2}}{2 D}.\n$$\nHere, the distance from the cell periphery to the geometric center is the cell radius $R$, so take $L = R$.\n\nFor the prokaryote, the diameter is $1.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, so the radius is $R_{p} = 0.5\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}$.

Moreover, diffusion time scales as $t \\propto L^{2}$, so the 20-fold increase in radius from prokaryote to eukaryote yields roughly a 400-fold increase in diffusion time (from milliseconds to about one second), indicating that passive diffusion becomes limiting over eukaryotic length scales and supporting the biological conclusion that active intracellular transport systems are necessary in larger cells. Therefore, A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2288081"}, {"introduction": "Beyond physical structure, the way cells control their genes reveals deep evolutionary divergences. Prokaryotic gene regulation is often a direct, real-time response to environmental cues, like a simple on-off switch. Eukaryotic regulation, enabled by the packaging of DNA into chromatin within a nucleus, allows for more sophisticated and lasting control. This practice explores the concept of \"epigenetic memory,\" where a eukaryotic cell can \"remember\" a past stimulus long after it has vanished, a feat of regulatory stability that is fundamentally different from the transient prokaryotic response [@problem_id:2288117].", "problem": "Consider two distinct microorganisms being studied in a laboratory. The first is a prokaryotic bacterium, *Bacillus responsus*, and the second is a unicellular eukaryotic yeast, *Saccharomyces stabilis*. Both organisms possess a gene, designated `GeneZ`, that allows them to metabolize a rare sugar called \"glycogenol.\" In both organisms, `GeneZ` is normally transcriptionally silent. Its expression can be induced by the presence of glycogenol in the growth medium. However, the regulatory architecture governing `GeneZ` differs fundamentally between the two species. In *B. responsus*, regulation is controlled by a simple repressor protein that detaches from the DNA operator sequence in the presence of glycogenol. In *S. stabilis*, `GeneZ` is located within a tightly packed region of heterochromatin, and its activation requires significant chromatin remodeling, including histone acetylation, which is initiated by a signaling cascade triggered by glycogenol.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where both cultures are grown in a standard medium, then exposed to a high concentration of glycogenol for a period of two hours. After this induction period, the cells are thoroughly washed and transferred to a fresh medium completely lacking glycogenol. The expression levels of `GeneZ` are then monitored in the original cells and their subsequent progeny over many generations.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the difference in the expression pattern of `GeneZ` between *B. responsus* and *S. stabilis* following the removal of the inducing sugar?\n\nA. Both organisms will show a rapid decline in `GeneZ` expression that returns to a silent state almost immediately after glycogenol is removed. The primary difference will be a slightly higher peak expression in the eukaryote due to its more complex transcriptional machinery.\n\nB. *B. responsus* will exhibit a rapid cessation of `GeneZ` expression upon removal of glycogenol. In contrast, *S. stabilis* will demonstrate sustained expression of `GeneZ` that persists for a noticeable duration and may even be inherited by daughter cells for several generations in the absence of the inducer.\n\nC. *S. stabilis* will respond much more quickly to the presence of glycogenol than *B. responsus*. However, in both cell types, the expression of `GeneZ` will be tightly coupled to the inducer, ceasing immediately upon its removal from the medium.\n\nD. In both organisms, the two-hour exposure to glycogenol will cause a permanent and irreversible switch, leading to the constitutive expression of `GeneZ` in all subsequent generations, regardless of the presence of the inducer.\n\nE. *B. responsus* will activate `GeneZ` expression, but *S. stabilis* will likely fail to show any expression because a two-hour induction period is too short to initiate the complex chromatin remodeling required to de-repress a gene from a heterochromatic state.", "solution": "1) Identify the regulatory architectures. In the prokaryote, Bacillus responsus, GeneZ is controlled by a simple repressor that binds the operator and blocks transcription in the absence of inducer; glycogenol acts as an inducer that binds the repressor and causes dissociation from DNA, allowing transcription. In the eukaryote, Saccharomyces stabilis, GeneZ resides in heterochromatin and requires chromatin remodeling, including histone acetylation, initiated by a signaling cascade triggered by glycogenol, to become transcriptionally active.\n\n2) Predict the behavior upon removal of inducer in the prokaryote. When glycogenol is washed out, intracellular inducer concentration rapidly declines. The repressor, now unbound by inducer, quickly rebinds its operator due to high DNA affinity and the lack of chromatin barriers. This direct coupling leads to rapid cessation of transcription. Any residual mRNA and protein decay with their intrinsic degradation/dilution kinetics, but active transcription turns off quickly and shows minimal persistence or heritable memory across generations.\n\n3) Predict the behavior upon removal of inducer in the eukaryote. Activation required chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation. These epigenetic marks and remodeled nucleosome positions can be self-reinforcing and maintained transiently through positive feedback (e.g., bromodomain-containing factors stabilizing acetylated chromatin, recruitment of additional coactivators), and can be partially propagated through DNA replication because modified histones are distributed to daughter strands and can template re-establishment of the active chromatin state. Therefore, after glycogenol removal, GeneZ expression may persist for a noticeable time and potentially across several generations until deacetylases and chromatin remodelers re-establish heterochromatin. This constitutes epigenetic memory that outlasts the transient signal.\n\n4) Evaluate options:\n- A is incorrect because the eukaryotic gene, once remodeled, does not generally return to a silent state almost immediately; it often shows sustained expression due to epigenetic persistence. The “slightly higher peak expression” claim is irrelevant and not the key difference.\n- B is correct: rapid shutoff in the prokaryote due to direct repressor-operator control, and sustained, potentially heritable expression in the eukaryote due to chromatin-based memory.\n- C is incorrect because yeast chromatin remodeling is typically slower to initiate than a simple bacterial repressor response, and, crucially, eukaryotic expression does not cease immediately upon inducer removal due to the persistence of the remodeled state.\n- D is incorrect because chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation are generally reversible; the switch is not permanently constitutive without ongoing signals.\n- E is incorrect because a two-hour induction is sufficient to initiate chromatin remodeling and induce expression in yeast; many inducible systems remodel within minutes to hours.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that Bacillus responsus shuts off rapidly, while Saccharomyces stabilis shows sustained, sometimes heritable, expression after inducer removal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2288117"}, {"introduction": "A cell's design directly impacts its energy budget.
