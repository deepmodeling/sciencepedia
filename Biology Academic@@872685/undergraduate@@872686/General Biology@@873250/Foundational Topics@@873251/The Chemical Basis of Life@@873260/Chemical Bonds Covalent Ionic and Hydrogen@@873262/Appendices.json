You will calculate how water's high dielectric constant weakens the attraction between $Na^{+}$ and $Cl^{-}$ ions, explaining a fundamental principle that governs interactions in the aqueous environment of the cell.", "problem": "A biology student observes that table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl), readily dissolves in water but remains as a solid crystal when placed in hexane (C$_6$H$_{14}$), a nonpolar solvent. To understand this phenomenon from a physical chemistry perspective, the student decides to model the ionic bond between a single Na$^{+}$ ion and a Cl$^{-}$ ion using electrostatics.\n\nThe stability of the ionic bond in a solvent is determined by comparing its energy to the average thermal energy of the solvent molecules. The bond energy, $E_{bond}$, can be approximated by the magnitude of the electrostatic potential energy between the two ions when immersed in the solvent. This energy is given by:\n\n$$E_{bond} = \\frac{k_e |q_1 q_2|}{\\kappa r}$$\n\nwhere $k_e$ is Coulomb's constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges of the ions, $r$ is the distance between them, and $\\kappa$ is the dimensionless dielectric constant of the solvent. The average thermal energy of the solvent at temperature $T$ is given by $E_{th} = k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor the salt to dissolve, the thermal energy of the surrounding solvent molecules must be sufficient to overcome the ionic bond energy. The student hypothesizes that dissolution is favorable when the ratio $R = \\frac{E_{bond}}{E_{th}}$ is small, and unfavorable when it is large.\n\nUsing the values provided below, calculate the ratio $R$ for both water ($R_{\\text{water}}$) and hexane ($R_{\\text{hexane}}$).

Since $R_{\\text{water}}\\approx 2.5$ is far smaller than $R_{\\text{hexane}}\\approx 106$, this supports the observation that NaCl dissolves in water but not in hexane.

This problem challenges you to predict the fate of such an amphipathic molecule when it encounters a cell, introducing the critical concept of the hydrophobic effect [@problem_id:2285747]. By analyzing the interplay between hydrogen bonding with water and interactions with the nonpolar lipid bilayer, you will understand a key principle governing molecular transport and membrane structure.", "problem": "A new potential drug molecule, which we will call \"Amphipathol-11,\" has been synthesized for testing. Its structure consists of a single hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to one end of an unbranched eleven-carbon saturated hydrocarbon chain ($\\text{CH}_3(\\text{CH}_2)_{10}\\text{OH}$). To be effective, a drug must often cross the cell membrane to reach its target inside the cell. The cell membrane is a lipid bilayer, characterized by a nonpolar (hydrophobic) core, while the bloodstream and the cell's cytoplasm are primarily aqueous (polar) environments.\n\nBased on the principles of chemical bonding and intermolecular forces, predict the most likely behavior of Amphipathol-11 when it encounters a cell. Choose the option that correctly identifies its most probable location and the primary chemical reason for this behavior.\n\nA. It will remain dissolved in the aqueous bloodstream, because the hydroxyl group allows the entire molecule to be soluble in water via strong ionic bonds.\n\nB. It will readily embed itself within the nonpolar core of the lipid bilayer, because the hydrophobic interactions involving its long hydrocarbon chain are the dominant force driving its partitioning.\n\nC. It will remain dissolved in the aqueous bloodstream, as the single hydroxyl group's ability to form hydrogen bonds with water is sufficient to make the entire large molecule water-soluble.\n\nD. It will readily embed itself within the nonpolar core of the lipid bilayer, where it will form new covalent bonds with the lipid molecules, permanently integrating into the membrane.\n\nE. It will be found equally distributed between the bloodstream and the lipid bilayer, as the polar and nonpolar characteristics of the molecule are perfectly balanced.", "solution": "We identify the functional groups and their intermolecular interactions. Amphipathol-11 has a single hydroxyl group capable of acting as a hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor, attached to an unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chain with eleven carbons, which is strongly nonpolar. In water, the hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules, but the extended nonpolar chain cannot engage in favorable polar interactions; instead, it induces structuring of water around the hydrophobic surface, which decreases the entropy of the solvent.\n\nThe thermodynamic driving force can be framed in terms of the free energy change for transferring the molecule from water into the nonpolar environment of the lipid bilayer. Using the relation $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$, the hydrophobic effect in water corresponds primarily to an entropic penalty from ordered water around the hydrocarbon chain. Partitioning the long hydrocarbon chain into the bilayer’s nonpolar core reduces the exposed hydrophobic surface to water, releasing ordered water and increasing the entropy of the system, thereby making the transfer more favorable (more negative $\\Delta G$). Within the bilayer, the hydrocarbon chain experiences favorable London dispersion interactions with lipid acyl chains, while the hydroxyl group can reside near the interfacial region where it can form hydrogen bonds with water or lipid headgroups. No new covalent bonds are formed in this process; the interactions are noncovalent (dispersion, hydrogen bonding, and the hydrophobic effect).\n\nEvaluating the choices:\n- Option A is incorrect because the hydroxyl group does not form ionic bonds with water under physiological conditions; it participates in hydrogen bonding, and the molecule is not ionized.\n- Option C is incorrect because a single hydroxyl group is insufficient to render an eleven-carbon chain fully water-soluble; the large hydrophobic region dominates, leading to poor aqueous solubility.\n- Option D is incorrect because embedding in membranes does not involve forming new covalent bonds with lipids; integration is driven by noncovalent interactions and the hydrophobic effect.\n- Option E is unlikely because the molecule’s characteristics are not perfectly balanced; the long nonpolar chain outweighs the single polar group, biasing partitioning toward the membrane.\n- Option B correctly identifies that Amphipathol-11 will preferentially embed in the nonpolar core of the lipid bilayer, driven by hydrophobic interactions of the long hydrocarbon chain and the accompanying favorable entropic change, with the hydroxyl group likely oriented toward the interfacial region to engage in hydrogen bonding.\n\nTherefore, the most probable behavior is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2285747"}, {"introduction": "A protein's biological function is critically dependent on its intricate three-dimensional shape. This exercise explores what happens when this delicate structure is disrupted by a single genetic mutation, a common cause of disease [@problem_id:2285783]. You will act as a molecular detective, diagnosing why placing a charged amino acid into the water-fearing hydrophobic core of a protein has such devastating consequences for its stability and function.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a hypothetical globular enzyme called \"Chymase-X,\" which functions optimally in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm. The native three-dimensional (tertiary) structure of Chymase-X is crucial for its catalytic activity and is stabilized by a combination of disulfide bridges, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. A single point mutation occurs in the gene encoding Chymase-X, resulting in the substitution of a valine residue with an aspartate residue. This substitution takes place in a region deep within the protein's core, an area that, in the native structure, is completely shielded from water. This single amino acid change is observed to completely abolish the enzyme's function.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary and most significant molecular disruption responsible for the loss of the protein's native structure and function?\n\nA. The mutation directly breaks covalent disulfide bridges, unraveling key structural loops.\n\nB. The mutation introduces a charged residue into the nonpolar core, fundamentally disrupting the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the protein's folding.\n\nC. The mutation cleaves the covalent peptide bond in the protein's backbone, leading to fragmentation of the polypeptide chain.\n\nD. The mutation prevents the formation of hydrogen bonds essential for stabilizing an alpha-helical secondary structure segment.\n\nE. The mutation creates an inappropriate ionic bond in the protein's core, locking it into a non-functional conformation.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the key forces stabilizing the tertiary structure of a globular protein in an aqueous cytosolic environment: hydrophobic interactions drive burial of nonpolar side chains in the protein core to minimize exposure to water; hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions (salt bridges), and disulfide bonds further stabilize the folded state. In globular proteins, the hydrophobic effect is the dominant determinant of core packing, with the core typically composed of nonpolar residues.\n\nThe mutation replaces valine, a hydrophobic, nonpolar residue that is energetically favored in the protein’s nonpolar core, with aspartate, which bears a carboxylate side chain that is negatively charged at cytosolic $\\text{pH}$ because its side-chain $pK_{a}$ is well below cytosolic $\\text{pH}$. Introducing a charged, highly polar side chain into an environment that is normally dehydrated and nonpolar is energetically extremely unfavorable due to a large desolvation penalty and the lack of favorable electrostatic interactions to compensate. This leads to destabilization of the hydrophobic core, disruption of tertiary packing, and often global unfolding or misfolding, thereby abolishing enzymatic function. Thus, the primary and most significant disruption is the collapse of the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the native fold.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is incorrect because disulfide bridges are covalent bonds formed between cysteine residues; a Val to Asp substitution does not directly break disulfide bonds unless a cysteine is altered, which it is not here.\nC is incorrect because a point mutation does not cleave the peptide backbone; the covalent peptide bonds remain intact.\nD is less accurate because while side-chain substitutions can sometimes influence local secondary structure, the decisive effect here stems from burying a charged residue in a hydrophobic core, which is a tertiary-structure destabilization rather than a primary disruption of alpha-helical hydrogen bonding.\nE is less accurate because the overarching effect is not the creation of a stabilizing or misdirected ionic bond; rather, it is the severe energetic penalty of burying a charge without appropriate compensatory interactions. Even if a salt bridge formed, burying ion pairs in the hydrophobic core is generally destabilizing unless exquisitely preorganized, and the most general and primary effect is disruption of hydrophobic packing.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the mutation introduces a charged residue into the nonpolar core, fundamentally disrupting the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the protein’s folding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2285783"}]}
