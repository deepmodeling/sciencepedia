This first practice problem focuses on the amino acid isoleucine, which has two chiral centers, to solidify the distinction between enantiomers and diastereomers. By analyzing the relationship between the naturally occurring L-isoleucine and its non-proteinogenic cousin, L-alloisoleucine, you will apply the core definitions that govern molecular configuration.

Its structure possesses two chiral centers: the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) and the beta-carbon ($C_{\\beta}$) located within its side chain. The 'L' and 'D' notation for amino acids refers to the absolute configuration at the $C_{\\alpha}$. The naturally occurring form incorporated into proteins is L-isoleucine. A different, non-proteinogenic stereoisomer is L-alloisoleucine.\n\nBoth L-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine share the same 'L' configuration at the alpha-carbon.

Conformational isomers", "solution": "The problem asks for the stereochemical relationship between L-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine, given that they both have two chiral centers and specific information about their configurations.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the types of isomerism presented in the options.\n- **Constitutional isomers** (or structural isomers) are molecules that have the same molecular formula but different connectivity (i.e., the atoms are bonded in a different order).\n- **Stereoisomers** are molecules that have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms. Stereoisomers can be further classified.\n- **Enantiomers** are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. For a molecule with multiple chiral centers, its enantiomer has the opposite configuration at *every* chiral center.\n- **Diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs in compounds with two or more chiral centers when they have different configurations at some, but not all, of the corresponding chiral centers.\n- **Conformational isomers** (or conformers) are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. They are not different compounds.\n- **Identical compounds** have the same structure and configuration and are superimposable.\n\nStep 2: Apply the definitions to the molecules in the problem.\nThe problem states that L-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine are stereoisomers of isoleucine. This means they have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity. This fact immediately eliminates option C, \"Constitutional isomers.\" Since they are described as different stereoisomers, option D, \"Identical compounds,\" is also incorrect. Conformational isomers are not distinct compounds, but rather different rotational states of the same molecule, so option E is also incorrect. The relationship must be either enantiomers or diastereomers.\n\nStep 3: Distinguish between enantiomers and diastereomers based on the provided information.\nIsoleucine has two chiral centers: the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) and the beta-carbon ($C_{\\beta}$). Let's denote the configuration at these centers as a pair, $(C_{\\alpha}, C_{\\beta})$.\n- The problem states that both molecules are 'L' isomers. This means they have the same configuration at the alpha-carbon. Let's represent this configuration as 'L-config'.\n- The problem states they have opposite configurations at the beta-carbon. Let's call the configuration for L-isoleucine 'config-1' and for L-alloisoleucine 'config-2', where 'config-2' is the opposite of 'config-1'.\n\nSo, we can represent the configurations as:\n- L-isoleucine: (L-config, config-1)\n- L-alloisoleucine: (L-config, config-2)\n\nStep 4: Determine if they are enantiomers.\nFor two molecules to be enantiomers, they must be non-superimposable mirror images. In terms of configuration at chiral centers, this means that every chiral center must be inverted. The enantiomer of L-isoleucine would have the configuration (D-config, config-2), where 'D-config' is the opposite of 'L-config'.\nThe configuration of L-alloisoleucine is (L-config, config-2). Comparing this to the enantiomer of L-isoleucine, (D-config, config-2), we see they are not the same. Therefore, L-alloisoleucine is not the enantiomer of L-isoleucine. This eliminates option A.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the relationship.\nL-isoleucine and L-alloisoleucine are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. By definition, such molecules are diastereomers. They have one stereocenter in common (the $C_{\\alpha}$) and one that is different (the $C_{\\beta}$). This is the characteristic feature of a diastereomeric relationship in molecules with two chiral centers.\n\nTo be more rigorous using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) notation:\n- The L-configuration at the alpha-carbon corresponds to the (S) configuration for almost all amino acids, including isoleucine. So, both molecules are (S) at $C_{\\alpha}$ (which is carbon-2).\n- The two possible configurations at the beta-carbon (carbon-3) are (S) and (R).\n- L-isoleucine is specifically (2S, 3S)-isoleucine.\n- L-alloisoleucine is (2S, 3R)-isoleucine.\n- The enantiomer of L-isoleucine, (2S, 3S), would be D-isoleucine, which is (2R, 3R).\n- Since L-alloisoleucine (2S, 3R) is not the same as L-isoleucine (2S, 3S) and not its enantiomer (2R, 3R), they must be diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is diastereomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2139350"}, {"introduction": "Having established the rules of configuration, we now explore how this fixed geometry influences the dynamic world of conformation.
