By considering what happens when this signal is genetically removed, you can deduce the default fate of a large protein and appreciate why the Nuclear Pore Complex does not permit unrestricted entry.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a hypothetical human protein called \"Chromatin Organizer Factor 1\" (ChOF1), which plays a critical role in structuring chromatin within the nucleus. The ChOF1 protein has a molecular weight of 110 kDa. To investigate its transport mechanism, the biochemist uses genetic engineering to create a mutant version of the protein, designated ChOF1-$\\Delta$NLS. In this mutant, the gene segment that codes for the protein's Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), a specific sequence of amino acids responsible for targeting the protein to the nucleus, has been deleted.\nThe gene for this mutant ChOF1-$\\Delta$NLS protein is then introduced into a culture of human cells, and the cells are given sufficient time to synthesize the protein. The cells inherently possess all the necessary machinery for protein transport, including the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), which regulates molecular traffic across the nuclear envelope. Assuming the deletion of the NLS does not affect the protein's overall folding or stability, what is the expected predominant subcellular location of the newly synthesized ChOF1-$\\Delta$NLS protein at steady state?\n\nA. Concentrated within the nucleolus\n\nB. Evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus\n\nC. Secreted into the extracellular medium\n\nD. Embedded within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane\n\nE. Predominantly in the cytoplasm\n\nF. Localized to the mitochondrial matrix", "solution": "1) The native localization of ChOF1 requires an NLS recognized by importin receptors to mediate active transport through the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). Active nuclear import depends on NLS-importin binding and the Ran-GTP gradient; without an NLS, importins do not bind and active import does not occur.\n\n2) Passive diffusion through the NPC is size-limited; macromolecules larger than approximately $40$ to $60\\ \\text{kDa}$ do not equilibrate efficiently by passive diffusion. The mutant protein ChOF1-$\\Delta$NLS has a molecular weight of $110\\ \\text{kDa}$, which exceeds this passive diffusion threshold. Therefore, in the absence of an NLS, it will not accumulate in the nucleus by either passive diffusion or active transport.\n\n3) In the absence of any other targeting signals, the default localization of a newly synthesized cytosolic protein is the cytoplasm. The mutant is specified to differ only by deletion of the NLS and to have unchanged folding and stability, implying no new targeting sequence is created.\n\n4) Alternative localizations require specific signals that are absent here:\n- Secretion into the extracellular medium requires an N-terminal signal peptide that directs cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum; this is not provided.\n- Embedding in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane requires a signal peptide and/or transmembrane domains; not indicated.\n- Mitochondrial matrix targeting requires an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence; not present.\n- Nucleolar localization requires nuclear entry plus nucleolar localization determinants; nuclear entry is abrogated without an NLS.\n- Even distribution between cytoplasm and nucleus would occur only for small proteins capable of passive diffusion across the NPC; $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ is too large.\n\n5) Therefore, at steady state, the ChOF1-$\\Delta$NLS protein will be predominantly in the cytoplasm.\n\nThe corresponding choice is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2035884"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple import, the cell employs a complex multi-step postal system, the secretory pathway, to sort proteins to various destinations like the lysosome or outside the cell. This problem [@problem_id:2035867] delves into this network by examining a clinical scenario where the specific sorting tag for lysosomal enzymes, mannose-6-phosphate, cannot be added. This exercise highlights how a failure in a specific sorting step leads not to chaos, but to diversion into a \"default\" pathway, providing a powerful lesson on the logic of intracellular trafficking.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, proteins destined for the lysosome are tagged with a specific carbohydrate marker, mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), within the Golgi apparatus. This tag allows them to be sorted into vesicles that deliver them to the lysosome. Consider a patient with a rare genetic disorder where the enzyme responsible for adding the M6P tag to newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases is completely non-functional. As a result, the hydrolases are not recognized by the sorting machinery in the trans-Golgi network. Based on your understanding of protein trafficking, which of the following is the most direct and prominent consequence that would be observed in the patient's extracellular fluid?\n\nA. A significantly elevated concentration of various lysosomal hydrolases.\n\nB. A massive accumulation of undigested glycosaminoglycans and sphingolipids.\n\nC. A complete absence of secretory proteins, such as albumin and collagen.\n\nD. The presence of M6P receptors that have been shed from the cell surface.\n\nE. An abnormally high concentration of free mannose-6-phosphate molecules.", "solution": "Step 1: State the normal trafficking mechanism. In eukaryotic cells, soluble lysosomal hydrolases synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum are transported to the Golgi apparatus. In the cis-Golgi, the key targeting signal mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) is added to N-linked oligosaccharides by the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), M6P-tagged hydrolases bind M6P receptors, which package them into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for endosomes and, ultimately, lysosomes.\n\nStep 2: Apply the defect described. If the enzyme that adds M6P is completely non-functional, newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases lack the M6P tag. Without this tag, they cannot bind M6P receptors in the TGN and thus are not sorted into vesicles for lysosomal delivery.\n\nStep 3: Determine the default pathway. Proteins that are not specifically sorted in the TGN typically follow the constitutive secretory pathway. Therefore, untagged lysosomal hydrolases are secreted extracellularly.\n\nStep 4: Predict the extracellular fluid consequence. Because many lysosomal hydrolases are misdirected into the constitutive secretory pathway, the most direct and prominent change in extracellular fluid is a significantly elevated concentration of various lysosomal hydrolases.\n\nStep 5: Exclude alternative options.\n- Option B describes intracellular accumulation of undigested substrates, which is a hallmark of I-cell disease but is not the most direct finding in extracellular fluid.\n- Option C is incorrect because general secretory proteins (e.g., albumin, collagen) use the secretory pathway and do not depend on M6P tagging.\n- Option D is incorrect because M6P receptors are membrane proteins that cycle between TGN and endosomes; pathological shedding is not the expected direct consequence.\n- Option E is incorrect because the defect prevents addition of M6P to proteins; it does not generate excess free M6P in extracellular fluid.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2035867"}, {"introduction": "What happens when a protein receives conflicting delivery instructions? This advanced problem [@problem_id:2035892] presents a chimeric protein engineered with targeting signals for both the mitochondrion and the nucleus, challenging you to resolve the conflict. Solving this puzzle requires moving beyond the mere presence of signals to consider the hierarchy, timing, and biophysical mechanics of translocation, revealing that some transport decisions, once made, are irreversible.", "problem": "In a molecular biology experiment, a chimeric gene is constructed to express a novel protein in a cultured mammalian cell line. The engineered protein has the following distinct features: at its N-terminus, it possesses a complete and functional mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) that directs proteins to the mitochondrial matrix. Located internally within the polypeptide chain is a single, fully functional nuclear localization signal (NLS). Both signals are correctly folded and exposed in the final polypeptide. You are to assume that protein synthesis occurs on free ribosomes in the cytosol and that the mitochondrial targeting sequence is irreversibly cleaved by a peptidase upon successful import of the protein into the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nConsidering the established principles of protein sorting and intracellular trafficking, determine the predominant, stable subcellular location of this chimeric protein after its synthesis and processing.\n\nA. The nucleus\n\nB. The mitochondrial matrix\n\nC. The cytosol\n\nD. A bimodal distribution, with significant populations in both the nucleus and the mitochondrial matrix\n\nE. The peroxisome\n\nF. The endoplasmic reticulum lumen", "solution": "First, identify the signals and their canonical mechanisms. An N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) is an amphipathic helix recognized in the cytosol by mitochondrial import receptors (e.g., TOM complex), and directs post-translational import of an unfolded polypeptide across the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes via TOM and TIM complexes into the mitochondrial matrix. Upon successful translocation into the matrix, the MTS is cleaved irreversibly by the matrix processing peptidase, leaving a mature polypeptide that no longer contains the MTS. In contrast, an internal nuclear localization signal (NLS) is recognized by importins in the cytosol and mediates transport of folded cargo through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus, driven by the Ran GTPase cycle. The NLS pathway functions from the cytosolic side and does not operate within mitochondria.\n\nSecond, apply the synthesis and trafficking context. The protein is synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes, so both signals are initially exposed to the cytosol. Cytosolic chaperones bind MTS-containing precursors and maintain them in an import-competent, largely unfolded state, which favors rapid engagement with the mitochondrial import machinery. Mitochondrial import is post-translational but is typically efficient for strong N-terminal presequences and proceeds vectorially across both membranes into the matrix.\n\nThird, incorporate the stated irreversibility of MTS processing. Once the protein reaches the matrix, the MTS is cleaved by a peptidase; this is irreversible and there is no physiological export pathway from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol for such proteins. The internal NLS, while still present in the polypeptide, cannot recruit importins or access the nuclear pore complex from within the mitochondrial matrix, and therefore cannot redirect the protein to the nucleus after mitochondrial import.\n\nFourth, analyze possible competition between signals before import. Although an internal NLS could, in principle, recruit importins in the cytosol, mitochondrial targeting via an N-terminal presequence generally dominates because: (i) the presequence is recognized co- or immediately post-translationally, with chaperone assistance that maintains an import-competent conformation; (ii) successful mitochondrial import removes the MTS and sequesters the protein in a compartment from which nuclear import machinery is inaccessible; and (iii) the question asks for the predominant, stable location after synthesis and processing. Even if a minor fraction were to engage nuclear import before mitochondrial engagement, only the mitochondrial pathway yields an irreversibly trapped, processed species. Thus, the stable, predominant pool will reside in the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nFifth, exclude other destinations. The cytosol is not the stable location because a functional MTS will deplete cytosolic pools via import. The peroxisome requires a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1 or PTS2), which is absent. The endoplasmic reticulum lumen requires a signal peptide recognized by SRP and ER translocation machinery, which is absent. A bimodal distribution is inconsistent with the stated irreversibility and sequestration and is not expected to be predominant and stable.\n\nTherefore, by established principles of protein sorting and the specified irreversible processing, the chimeric protein’s predominant, stable subcellular location is the mitochondrial matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2035892"}]}
