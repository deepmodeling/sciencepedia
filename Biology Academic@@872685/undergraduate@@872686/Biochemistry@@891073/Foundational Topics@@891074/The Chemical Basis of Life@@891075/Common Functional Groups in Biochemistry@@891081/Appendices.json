Structural analysis of the GAT-X active site reveals two crucial interactions with the side chain of L-glutamine. The active site contains a residue that acts as a hydrogen bond donor to the carbonyl oxygen of the glutamine side chain, and another residue that acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor for one of the hydrogen atoms of the amide (-NH_2) group of the glutamine side chain. The inhibitor will be designed by chemically modifying the side chain of L-glutamic acid.\n\nThe side chain of L-glutamine is -CH_2-CH_2-C(=O)NH_2.\nThe side chain of L-glutamic acid is -CH_2-CH_2-COOH.\n\nAssuming the backbone of the amino acid fits perfectly into the active site, which of the following modified L-glutamic acid analogs would be the most potent competitive inhibitor for GAT-X at physiological pH (approximately 7.4)?\n\nA.

The enzyme furnishes (i) a hydrogen bond donor to the side-chain carbonyl oxygen and (ii) a hydrogen bond acceptor positioned to accept a hydrogen from the side-chain amide nitrogen. Therefore, the optimal inhibitor side chain must present simultaneously (a) a carbonyl oxygen that can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor and (b) an amide-like N–H that can act as a hydrogen bond donor, at the same spatial position and with the same methylene spacing as L-glutamine’s side chain.\n\nReference substrate geometry: L-glutamine’s side chain is a two-methylene spacer terminating in a neutral amide, i.e., two methylenes followed by a carbonyl and an amide nitrogen bearing at least one hydrogen. This provides (1) a carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bond acceptor and (2) an amide N–H hydrogen bond donor.\n\nEvaluate candidates against the two-interaction and spacing criteria:\n1) L-glutamic acid backbone fit is assumed correct; modifications are at the side chain terminus. A carboxyl group does not supply an amide N–H donor; furthermore, at physiological pH it is deprotonated, altering electrostatics and hydrogen bond patterns relative to a neutral amide.\n2) Option A (aldehyde): has a carbonyl oxygen acceptor but lacks an amide N–H donor; thus it cannot satisfy the enzyme’s acceptor site for the substrate’s amide hydrogen. It also differs in polarity/reactivity from an amide.\n3) Option B (aspartic acid): shortens the spacer by one methylene, disrupting the geometry required to match both interaction sites; it also retains a carboxylate rather than an amide, lacking the N–H donor.\n4) Option C (gamma-hydroxamate): replaces the terminal carboxyl with a hydroxamic acid functionality, i.e., a carbonyl adjacent to an N–H and an N–O–H. Critically, this preserves (i) a carbonyl oxygen that can accept a hydrogen bond from the enzyme donor and (ii) an amide-like N–H that can donate to the enzyme’s acceptor, while maintaining the two-methylene spacing to the carbonyl. Hydroxamates are established amide bioisosteres that often better mimic amide hydrogen-bonding than carboxylates at physiological pH.\n5) Option D (alpha-aminoadipic acid): lengthens the spacer by one methylene, misaligning the carbonyl relative to the interaction points; also retains a carboxylate and lacks an amide N–H.\n6) Option E (tetrazole carboxylate bioisostere): a tetrazole mimics a carboxylic acid, not an amide. At physiological pH it is deprotonated and lacks an amide N–H donor; geometry and hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor pattern do not match glutamine’s amide.\n\nConclusion: Only the gamma-hydroxamate preserves both the required hydrogen-bond acceptor (carbonyl oxygen) and donor (amide-like N–H) at the correct spacing to mimic glutamine’s side chain. Therefore, it is expected to be the most potent competitive inhibitor among the options.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2035682"}]}
