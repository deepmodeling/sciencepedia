One such probe is a weakly basic amine compound that we will call \"LysoProbe\". The neutral form of LysoProbe (B) is freely permeable across cell membranes, but its protonated, charged form (BH⁺) is not. Once the neutral form enters an acidic compartment like a lysosome, it becomes protonated and is trapped, causing the probe to accumulate.\n\nConsider a cell culture where the cytoplasmic pH is maintained at a constant 7.40. The conjugate acid of LysoProbe (BH⁺) has a pKa of 7.80. After adding the probe to the culture medium, a researcher uses fluorescence microscopy to measure the concentration of the probe. They find that the total concentration of the probe (both forms B and BH⁺) inside the lysosomes is 250 times greater than the total concentration of the probe in the cytoplasm.\n\nAssuming the system has reached a steady state where the concentrations are stable, calculate the internal pH of the lysosomes.

Initially, at time $t=0$, the M-proteins are confined to one hemisphere of the new cell's plasma membrane, and the H-proteins are confined to the other. The subsequent intermixing of these proteins is due to lateral diffusion within the membrane.\n\nThe rate of this diffusion is quantified by a diffusion coefficient, $D$, which is strongly dependent on temperature. This dependence can be modeled by the equation:\n$$D(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $D_0$ is a constant pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy for the diffusion process, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nAt a physiological temperature of $37.0^{\\circ}$C, it is observed that it takes a characteristic time of $\\tau_{37} = 40.0$ minutes for the M and H proteins to reach a state of near-complete intermixing.
