This exercise hones your ability to connect the elemental requirements of biomolecules to experimental outcomes.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is investigating metabolic pathways in a strain of bacteria. They prepare a chemically defined minimal medium, which contains glucose as the sole carbon source, along with essential salts providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and other trace minerals. Critically, this initial medium is completely devoid of sulfur. To initiate the experiment, the medium is supplemented with a single sulfur source: the amino acid methionine, in which the naturally occurring sulfur atom has been replaced with its radioactive isotope, sulfur-35 ($^{35}$S).\n\nThe bacteria are inoculated into this medium and allowed to grow for several generations. Following this incubation period, the bacterial cells are harvested and lysed. The cellular contents are then subjected to a fractionation process that separates the four major classes of biological macromolecules.\n\nAssuming the bacteria successfully grow and synthesize all necessary cellular components from the provided nutrients, which of the following macromolecular fractions would exhibit the highest concentration of radioactivity from the incorporated $^{35}$S?\n\nA.

Therefore, any sulfur incorporated into cellular macromolecules must derive from the sulfur atom of methionine, and all downstream sulfur-containing metabolites will carry the $^{35}\\text{S}$ label.\n\nTo determine which macromolecular fraction will show the highest radioactivity, consider which of the four classes characteristically contain sulfur:\n1. Nucleic acids: The sugar-phosphate backbone and the canonical bases contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, but not sulfur. Although certain minor RNA base modifications can be thiolated, these represent a negligible fraction relative to total nucleic acids and do not alter the conclusion that nucleic acids are not a major sulfur sink.\n2. Polysaccharides: Common bacterial polysaccharides are composed of monosaccharides lacking sulfur. Sulfated polysaccharides are not typical for bacteria in minimal media and, in any case, would be minor compared to proteins.\n3. Proteins: Sulfur is a constituent of the amino acids methionine and cysteine. In bacteria, supplied methionine can be incorporated directly into proteins at AUG codons and can also serve as a sulfur donor via transsulfuration pathways to synthesize cysteine, which is then incorporated at UGU/UGC codons. Consequently, a substantial fraction of cellular protein will contain sulfur derived from the labeled methionine.\n4. Lipids: Most bacterial lipids do not contain sulfur. While specialized sulfolipids exist in some organisms, they are not the predominant lipid class in standard bacterial minimal media and would constitute a minimal sulfur sink relative to proteins.\n\nBecause proteins ubiquitously and abundantly incorporate sulfur through methionine and cysteine residues, and the other listed macromolecular classes either lack sulfur or contain it only in trace, specialized forms, the protein fraction will exhibit the highest concentration of radioactivity from incorporated $^{35}\\text{S}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2082442"}, {"introduction": "After identifying that sulfur is a key component of proteins, the next logical step is to quantify its presence.
