Many simple sugars share the same molecular formula but differ in their structural arrangement. Consider the following three pairs of common hexose monosaccharides, all of which have the molecular formula $C_6H_{12}O_6$:\n\n*   **Pair I:** D-glucose and D-fructose\n*   **Pair II:** D-glucose and L-glucose\n*   **Pair III:** D-glucose and D-galactose\n\nBased on your understanding of stereochemistry, determine the correct isomeric relationship for each pair.

Epimers, Constitutional Isomers, Enantiomers\n\nF. All three pairs represent different types of Diastereomers.", "solution": "All three pairs share the molecular formula $C_6H_{12}O_6$, so any differences arise from connectivity (constitutional isomers) or spatial arrangement (stereoisomers). By definition, constitutional isomers have different connectivity, whereas stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in configuration. Among stereoisomers, enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images differing at all stereocenters, while diastereomers are non-mirror-image stereoisomers; epimers are a specific type of diastereomer that differ at exactly one stereocenter.\n\nFor Pair I (D-glucose and D-fructose), D-glucose is an aldohexose (carbonyl at C-1) and D-fructose is a ketohexose (carbonyl at C-2). The position of the carbonyl group changes the connectivity of atoms, so these are constitutional isomers.\n\nFor Pair II (D-glucose and L-glucose), the D/L designation indicates configurations that are mirror images at all chiral centers of the same sugar. Thus D-glucose and L-glucose have identical connectivity but opposite configurations at every stereocenter, making them enantiomers.\n\nFor Pair III (D-glucose and D-galactose), these sugars differ only at the configuration of C-4 among their stereocenters. They are therefore epimers at C-4, which are a subset of diastereomers. Among the given options, the classification that lists Pair III as diastereomers (recognizing that epimers are diastereomers) together with the correct identifications for Pairs I and II is the option that reads: Constitutional Isomers, Enantiomers, Diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2042427"}, {"introduction": "While the D/L system provides a relative configuration, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) system offers an unambiguous absolute configuration ($R$ or $S$). This practice explores a famous exception, L-cysteine, which forces a careful application of CIP priority rules and reveals why most L-amino acids are ($S$) but cysteine is ($R$) [@problem_id:2042405]. This will sharpen your ability to assign configurations by focusing on the underlying principles of atomic number priority.", "problem": "In biochemistry, most of the 20 common proteinogenic amino acids found in nature possess the L-configuration relative to glyceraldehyde. When assigning the absolute configuration to the alpha-carbon (Cα) chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, almost all of these L-amino acids are designated with an ($S$) configuration. However, a notable exception is L-cysteine, which is designated as ($R$) despite also having the L-configuration.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for this specific exception?\n\nA. The nitrogen atom of the amino group in L-cysteine has a higher atomic number than the sulfur atom of its side chain, reversing the priority order relative to L-alanine.\n\nB. The entire side chain of L-cysteine (-CH₂SH) is assigned a higher CIP priority than the carboxyl group (-COOH), whereas the side chain of L-alanine (-CH₃) has a lower priority than its carboxyl group.\n\nC. The R/S system designates the stereochemistry based on the molecule's three-dimensional shape, which is fundamentally altered by the bulky sulfur atom in cysteine, while the L/D system does not account for this.\n\nD. For L-cysteine, the lowest priority group (the hydrogen atom on the Cα) naturally orients toward the viewer in a standard Fischer projection, leading to an automatic reversal of the determined configuration from ($S$) to ($R$).\n\nE. The amino group (-NH₂) and the carboxyl group (-COOH) switch their priority rankings between L-alanine and L-cysteine due to electronic effects from the sulfur atom.", "solution": "We apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules at the $\\alpha$-carbon. The four substituents are $-\\text{NH}_2$, $-\\text{COOH}$, the side chain $R$, and $-H$. CIP priorities are assigned as follows:\n- Compare the atoms directly attached to the stereocenter: for $-\\text{NH}_2$ it is $\\mathrm{N}$ with atomic number $Z(\\mathrm{N})=7$; for $-\\text{COOH}$, $-\\text{CH}_3$, or $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{SH}$ it is $\\mathrm{C}$ with $Z(\\mathrm{C})=6$; for $-H$ it is $\\mathrm{H}$ with $Z(\\mathrm{H})=1$. Therefore $-\\text{NH}_2$ outranks any carbon substituent, and $-H$ is lowest.\n- To break ties between carbon substituents, compare the sets of atoms attached to that carbon (excluding the stereocenter), listed in decreasing $Z$ and expanded for multiple bonds (the multiple-bond rule duplicates the bonded atom).\n\nFor L-alanine ($R=-\\text{CH}_3$):\n- The methyl carbon is attached to $\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{H}$.\n- The carboxyl carbon (in $-\\text{COOH}$) is, by the multiple-bond rule, compared as attached to $\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{O}$, since the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ is treated as two $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$, and the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O(H)}$ contributes the third $\\mathrm{O}$.\n- Because $Z(\\mathrm{O})=8>Z(\\mathrm{H})=1$, $-\\text{COOH}$ outranks $-\\text{CH}_3$. Thus the order is $1:\\,-\\text{NH}_2$, $2:\\,-\\text{COOH}$, $3:\\,-\\text{CH}_3$, $4:\\,-H$.\n\nFor L-cysteine ($R=-\\text{CH}_2\\text{SH}$):\n- The methylene carbon is attached to $\\mathrm{S},\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{H}$.\n- The carboxyl carbon is as above $\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{O}$.\n- Since $Z(\\mathrm{S})=16>Z(\\mathrm{O})=8$, the $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{SH}$ substituent outranks $-\\text{COOH}$. Thus the order is $1:\\,-\\text{NH}_2$, $2:\\,-\\text{CH}_2\\text{SH}$, $3:\\,-\\text{COOH}$, $4:\\,-H$.\n\nRelating priority to configuration in the standard Fischer projection for L-amino acids (with $-\\text{COOH}$ at the top, $R$ at the bottom, $-\\text{NH}_2$ on the left, and $-H$ on the right), the horizontal substituents project toward the viewer, so the lowest priority $-H$ points toward the viewer. Therefore, the observed sense of $1\\to 2\\to 3$ must be inverted to assign $R/S$:\n- For L-alanine, $1\\to 2\\to 3$ is clockwise, inversion gives $(S)$.\n- For L-cysteine, swapping priorities $2$ and $3$ makes $1\\to 2\\to 3$ counterclockwise, inversion gives $(R)$.\n\nThus, the specific exception arises because in cysteine the side chain $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{SH}$ has higher CIP priority than the carboxyl group, whereas in alanine the side chain $-\\text{CH}_3$ has lower priority than the carboxyl group. This is exactly the reasoning in option B. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because:\n- A: $Z(\\mathrm{N})<Z(\\mathrm{S})$, and the amino group remains the highest among the three non-hydrogen substituents; this does not reverse the order relative to alanine.\n- C: CIP uses atomic-number-based rules, not overall shape or bulk.\n- D: The lowest-priority $-H$ points toward the viewer in the standard Fischer for all L-amino acids, so this does not uniquely cause cysteine to be $(R)$.\n- E: The priorities of $-\\text{NH}_2$ and $-\\text{COOH}$ do not switch; the switch occurs between $-\\text{COOH}$ and the side chain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2042405"}, {"introduction": "The biological activity of chiral molecules often resides in a single enantiomer, making the purity of a sample a critical concern in medicine.
