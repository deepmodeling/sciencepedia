For a molecular formula $C_{c}H_{h}O_{o}$ with no nitrogen or halogens, the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), which counts the total number of rings and multiple bonds, is\n$$\nD=\\frac{2c+2-h}{2}.\n$$\nFor the given fatty acid $C_{22}H_{32}O_{2}$, substituting $c=22$ and $h=32$ gives\n$$\nD=\\frac{2\\cdot 22+2-32}{2}=\\frac{44+2-32}{2}=\\frac{14}{2}=7.\n$$\nThis $D=7$ counts all rings and multiple bonds present. The problem states there are no cyclic structures and exactly one carboxylic acid group. The carboxyl group contains one carbonyl $C=O$ double bond, which contributes one unit to $D$.

The standard shorthand notation is given as C:D($\\Delta^x$), where 'C' is the total number of carbon atoms, 'D' is the number of double bonds, and '$x$' indicates the position of the double bond(s) counted from the carboxyl carbon (C-1). The omega ($\\omega$) classification system, alternatively, identifies the position of the first double bond counting from the methyl (or omega) end of the carbon chain.\n\nA biochemist is analyzing an oil extracted from a newly discovered plant seed.

The subscript for carbon (C) directly gives the total number of carbon atoms in the chain.\nTherefore, C = 18.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of double bonds (D).\nA fully saturated fatty acid with 'n' carbon atoms has the general formula $C_n H_{2n} O_2$. For an 18-carbon fatty acid (n=18), the saturated formula would be $C_{18}H_{2 \\times 18}O_2$, which is $C_{18}H_{36}O_2$.\nThe given fatty acid has the formula $C_{18}H_{34}O_2$.\nThe introduction of each double bond removes two hydrogen atoms from the carbon chain.
