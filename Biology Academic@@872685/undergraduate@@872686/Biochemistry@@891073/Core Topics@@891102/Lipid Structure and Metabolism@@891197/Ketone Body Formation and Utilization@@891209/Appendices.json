This exercise explores the concept of metabolic specialization by asking why certain cells, like mature red blood cells, cannot use ketone bodies for energy. Answering this question correctly requires you to connect a cell's metabolic capabilities directly to its subcellular anatomy, reinforcing a core principle of biochemistry [@problem_id:2055033].", "problem": "Mature mammalian red blood cells (erythrocytes) are highly specialized cells that lack a nucleus and most organelles to maximize their capacity for hemoglobin and oxygen transport. Their metabolic profile is consequently restricted. While many tissues, such as the brain and heart, can readily adapt to use ketone bodies (acetoacetate and D-β-hydroxybutyrate) as a significant energy source during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, mature erythrocytes are unable to do so. They rely exclusively on glucose for their ATP production.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason for the inability of mature red blood cells to utilize ketone bodies for energy?\n\nA. They lack the necessary monocarboxylate transporters on their plasma membrane to import ketone bodies from the bloodstream.\n\nB. They lack mitochondria and therefore do not possess the key enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase (thiophorase) required to activate acetoacetate.\n\nC. The high partial pressure of oxygen within erythrocytes allosterically inhibits the enzymes of the ketone body degradation pathway.\n\nD. They do not have a functional pentose phosphate pathway, which is required to generate the cofactors needed for ketone body oxidation.\n\nE. Their reliance on anaerobic glycolysis generates lactate, which competitively inhibits the initial step of ketone body utilization catalyzed by D-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase.", "solution": "Red blood cells lack mitochondria; consequently, they cannot carry out the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or oxidative phosphorylation and rely on cytosolic anaerobic glycolysis for ATP. They do possess the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH for antioxidant defense, but no mitochondrial pathways are available.\n\nUtilization of ketone bodies by extrahepatic tissues requires mitochondrial steps:\n1.

Therefore, even if ketone bodies enter the red cell, they cannot be metabolized for ATP.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect because erythrocytes possess monocarboxylate transporters; transport is not the fundamental block.\n- B is correct: the absence of mitochondria means the absence of SCOT and the entire mitochondrial machinery needed for ketone oxidation.\n- C is incorrect; oxygen tension does not allosterically inhibit ketone degradation enzymes in this context, and the primary block is organelle absence.\n- D is incorrect; erythrocytes have a functional pentose phosphate pathway, and PPP is not required for ketone oxidation.\n- E is incorrect; proposed competitive inhibition by lactate is not the fundamental reason, and the key issue remains the absence of mitochondria where $D\\text{-}\\beta\\text{-hydroxybutyrate}$ dehydrogenase and SCOT reside.\n\nThus, the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason is the lack of mitochondria and, consequently, the absence of SCOT and the required mitochondrial pathways.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2055033"}, {"introduction": "Having established how ketone bodies are made and where they are used, we now examine the system's response to disruption.

The key baseline processes are:\n- Adipose lipolysis increases plasma free fatty acids (FFAs); the liver takes up FFAs and performs $\\beta$-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH$_{2}$.\n- Hepatic ketogenesis disposes of acetyl-CoA and provides alternative fuel as ketone bodies (acetoacetate and $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate), thereby sparing glucose.\n\nThe mitochondrial ketogenesis steps are:\n1) Two acetyl-CoA condense to acetoacetyl-CoA via thiolase.\n2) Acetoacetyl-CoA combines with another acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA via HMG-CoA synthase.\n3) HMG-CoA lyase cleaves HMG-CoA to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA.\n\nThe administered agent is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA lyase.

The inhibitor does not diminish this hormonal drive. In addition, impaired hepatic ketogenesis reduces the liver’s capacity to dispose of incoming acetyl-CoA via ketone production, limiting hepatic clearance/utilization of FFAs and favoring accumulation in plasma. Therefore FFAs increase.\n\n3) Glucose: In prolonged fasting, ketone bodies normally spare glucose by supplying the brain and other tissues. With ketogenesis blocked at HMG-CoA lyase, ketone supply falls and peripheral glucose utilization must rise to meet energy demands. Although hepatic gluconeogenesis is stimulated by the fasting state and supported in part by ATP from $\\beta$-oxidation, the increased systemic demand for glucose in the absence of ketones typically exceeds supply, producing hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Therefore glucose decreases.\n\nThe directional changes are thus: FFAs increase, glucose decreases, acetoacetate decreases, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2055056"}]}
