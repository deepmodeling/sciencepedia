{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The decision to store energy as fat is a critical metabolic choice, governed by intricate regulatory networks. Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) stands at the heart of this process, catalyzing the committed step of fatty acid synthesis. This exercise challenges you to analyze how a liver cell integrates both hormonal signals, like insulin, and local metabolite levels, like citrate, to control ACC activity and direct the flow of carbon toward storage during times of energy abundance. Understanding this dual-regulation mechanism is fundamental to grasping how our bodies manage energy balance [@problem_id:2070163].", "problem": "In a hepatocyte (liver cell) actively responding to a carbohydrate-rich meal, two key metabolic conditions arise. First, the high blood glucose triggers a strong insulin signal. Second, the rapid rate of glycolysis and subsequent processing in the mitochondria lead to the accumulation and transport of citrate into the cytosol, resulting in a high cytosolic citrate concentration. Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) is the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis: the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The activity of ACC is regulated by both covalent modification (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) and allosteric effectors.\n\nGiven a hepatocyte with both high insulin signaling and high cytosolic citrate levels, which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of ACC and the resulting rate of fatty acid synthesis?\n\nA. ACC will be predominantly in its dephosphorylated state but will be allosterically inhibited, leading to a low rate of fatty acid synthesis.\n\nB. ACC will be predominantly in its phosphorylated state but will be allosterically activated, resulting in an intermediate rate of fatty acid synthesis.\n\nC. ACC will be predominantly in its phosphorylated state and allosterically inhibited, leading to a near-complete shutdown of fatty acid synthesis.\n\nD. ACC will be predominantly in its dephosphorylated state and will be allosterically activated, resulting in a very high rate of fatty acid synthesis.", "solution": "1) Identify covalent regulation by insulin. Principle: ACC activity is increased by dephosphorylation and decreased by phosphorylation. Mechanism: insulin signaling activates a protein phosphatase (e.g., PP2A), which dephosphorylates ACC, converting inactive phosphorylated ACC to the active dephosphorylated form. Therefore, under high insulin, ACC will be predominantly dephosphorylated and thus activated.\n\n2) Identify allosteric regulation by citrate. Principle: citrate is an allosteric activator of ACC; it promotes polymerization of ACC into its active filamentous form and increases its catalytic activity. Therefore, high cytosolic citrate allosterically activates ACC.\n\n3) Integrate both regulatory inputs. With high insulin, ACC is dephosphorylated and active. With high citrate, ACC is further allosterically activated. The combined effect of activating covalent modification and activating allosteric effector yields a very high ACC activity.\n\n4) Connect ACC activity to fatty acid synthesis rate. Principle: ACC catalyzes the rate-limiting step of fatty acid synthesis, producing malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Increased ACC activity increases malonyl-CoA formation, thereby increasing the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis. Thus, the expected outcome is a very high rate of fatty acid synthesis.\n\n5) Evaluate options. \n- A is incorrect because citrate does not inhibit ACC; it activates it.\n- B is incorrect because high insulin would not leave ACC predominantly phosphorylated; it drives dephosphorylation.\n- C is incorrect for the same reason and also contradicts citrate’s activating effect.\n- D correctly states that ACC is dephosphorylated and allosterically activated, producing a very high fatty acid synthesis rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2070163"}, {"introduction": "While storing fat is crucial, mobilizing it for energy is equally vital, particularly for sustained activities. This process is controlled at the gateway to the mitochondria, where the enzyme Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) determines the rate at which fatty acids can enter to be oxidized. This practice presents a pharmacological thought experiment involving a specific CPT1 inhibitor, asking you to connect a molecular blockade to a whole-organism physiological outcome. By working through this scenario, you will deepen your understanding of why fatty acid oxidation is indispensable for endurance and how metabolic pathways are interconnected at a systemic level [@problem_id:2070212].", "problem": "A pharmaceutical company is conducting a phase I clinical trial for a new weight-loss drug. The drug is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor of Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cell's cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation. As part of the safety assessment, a healthy, well-fed volunteer who has taken the drug undergoes a supervised exercise stress test, which involves running on a treadmill at a constant, moderate intensity for as long as possible.\n\nBased on the known mechanism of the drug, which of the following outcomes is the most likely physiological effect on the subject's exercise performance compared to their performance without the drug?\n\nA. The individual would experience a significantly reduced capacity for prolonged exercise, marked by premature fatigue, due to an inability to utilize long-chain fatty acids for ATP production and a forced over-reliance on limited glycogen stores.\n\nB. The individual's exercise capacity would be enhanced, as the block on fat metabolism would upregulate the more rapid ATP-producing pathway of glycolysis, providing energy more efficiently.\n\nC. The individual's exercise capacity would be unchanged, as the muscles would quickly adapt by switching to ketone bodies, which are produced by the liver as an alternative fuel source.\n\nD. The individual would primarily rely on protein catabolism for energy, allowing them to maintain exercise for a normal duration but with significantly increased muscle damage and soreness afterward.\n\nE. The individual's respiratory quotient (RQ) would decrease significantly throughout the exercise, indicating a more efficient, oxygen-sparing mode of metabolism.", "solution": "The key biochemical step affected is the carnitine shuttle. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) catalyzes the formation of acylcarnitine at the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is the rate-limiting step for transport of long-chain fatty acyl groups into the mitochondrial matrix for subsequent $\\beta$-oxidation. A highly specific, non-competitive CPT1 inhibitor will therefore block mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in skeletal muscle and liver.\n\nBy enzyme kinetics, non-competitive inhibition reduces catalytic capacity without being overcome by substrate. Under Michaelis–Menten assumptions, the velocity with inhibitor is\n$$\nv=\\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}[S]}{K_{m}+[S]},\\quad V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}=\\frac{V_{\\max}}{1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}},\\quad K_{m}\\ \\text{unchanged},\n$$\nso even at high fatty acid availability, maximal flux through CPT1 decreases. Because CPT1 is rate-limiting for long-chain fatty acid entry, the downstream pathway of $\\beta$-oxidation in muscle is constrained.\n\nDuring steady, moderate-intensity endurance exercise in a well-fed healthy person, a substantial fraction of ATP production is normally supplied by mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, sparing finite muscle and hepatic glycogen. Blocking CPT1 forces a fuel shift toward carbohydrate oxidation to sustain ATP demand at the given workload. The respiratory quotient (RQ) reflects the mix of oxidized fuels:\n$$\n\\text{RQ}=\\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\text{CO}_{2}}}{\\dot{V}_{\\text{O}_{2}}},\\quad \\text{RQ}_{\\text{CHO}}=1,\\quad \\text{RQ}_{\\text{fat}}\\approx 0.7.\n$$\nInhibition of fat oxidation shifts RQ upward toward $1$, not downward.\n\nThe physiological consequences follow:\n1) Glycogen becomes the primary fuel. Muscle glycogen stores are limited; when they are depleted or approach critically low levels, ATP production at the same absolute workload cannot be maintained, leading to premature fatigue and reduced time to exhaustion at a constant moderate intensity.\n2) Reliance on glycolysis increases, which can elevate lactate at a given absolute intensity if mitochondrial carbohydrate oxidation cannot fully match ATP demand, further contributing to fatigue. Although glycolysis can produce ATP quickly, the total sustainable energy over time is constrained by glycogen availability and metabolic byproducts.\n3) Alternative fuels are not adequate substitutes in this context. Ketone bodies are not acutely available in a well-fed state, and hepatic ketogenesis requires hepatic $\\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids, which is also CPT1-dependent; thus ketone production would be reduced rather than increased. Protein catabolism is not a primary fuel source during acute, moderate exercise and cannot replace the lost fat-derived ATP while maintaining performance.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is consistent with the above: impaired fat oxidation forces over-reliance on limited glycogen, reducing endurance and causing premature fatigue.\n- B is incorrect: although glycolysis is rapid, it cannot enhance endurance at a constant moderate load when fat oxidation is blocked; it hastens glycogen depletion and does not improve capacity.\n- C is incorrect: ketone production is low in the well-fed state and requires CPT1-mediated hepatic fatty acid oxidation; muscles cannot immediately switch to ketones to normalize endurance.\n- D is incorrect: protein catabolism does not support normal-duration exercise under these conditions and is not acutely upregulated to compensate sufficiently.\n- E is incorrect: with reduced fat oxidation and increased carbohydrate reliance, RQ increases toward $1$ rather than decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the most likely effect is a significantly reduced capacity for prolonged exercise with premature fatigue due to inability to oxidize long-chain fatty acids and forced dependence on limited glycogen stores.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2070212"}, {"introduction": "Nature often achieves complex regulation through specialization, exemplified by enzyme isoforms that perform distinct roles in different cellular locations. This advanced practice explores the functions of cytosolic ACC1 (for synthesis) versus mitochondrial ACC2 (for regulating oxidation). You are tasked with analyzing a hypothetical scenario where ACC2's regulatory function is disabled, creating a \"futile cycle\" where fatty acids are synthesized and immediately burned. This problem moves beyond qualitative prediction to a quantitative assessment, requiring you to perform a detailed ATP audit of the entire process, thereby revealing the profound energetic cost of breaking this elegant regulatory system [@problem_id:2070192].", "problem": "A pharmaceutical company is investigating a novel compound, \"Lipoclastin,\" as a potential therapeutic agent for metabolic disorders. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Lipoclastin is a highly specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial isoform of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, known as ACC2. This enzyme's primary role is to produce a local pool of malonyl-CoA that inhibits Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid import into the mitochondria for oxidation. Lipoclastin has no inhibitory effect on the primary cytosolic isoform, ACC1, which provides the malonyl-CoA substrate for fatty acid synthesis.\n\nConsider a liver cell in a state of high energy charge (i.e., an energy surplus from abundant glucose) where, due to the presence of Lipoclastin, the normal inhibition on fatty acid oxidation is lifted. In this scenario, a substrate cycle is established where newly synthesized fatty acids are immediately targeted for degradation.\n\nYour task is to calculate the net metabolic cost of this cycle. Specifically, determine the net number of moles of ATP consumed when one mole of palmitate (a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid) is first synthesized in the cytosol from mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, and then immediately activated and completely oxidized back to acetyl-CoA within the mitochondria.\n\nFor your calculations, use the following established metabolic stoichiometries and energy equivalences:\n- The transport of one mole of acetyl-CoA from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol consumes one mole of ATP.\n- The carboxylation of each mole of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by ACC1 consumes one mole of ATP.\n- The synthesis of one mole of palmitate by fatty acid synthase requires 14 moles of NADPH as a reductant.\n- The activation of one mole of palmitate to palmitoyl-CoA in the cytosol consumes the equivalent of two moles of ATP.\n- Assume the energy yields from oxidative phosphorylation are such that the oxidation of one mole of mitochondrial NADH yields 2.5 moles of ATP, and one mole of FADH2 yields 1.5 moles of ATP.\n- For the purpose of this energy balance, assume the reducing potential of cytosolic NADPH is energetically equivalent to mitochondrial NADH, yielding 2.5 moles of ATP per mole.\n\nExpress the net cost in moles of ATP. Your answer should be a positive integer representing the total expenditure.", "solution": "We interpret “completely oxidized back to acetyl-CoA within the mitochondria” as complete mitochondrial $\\beta$-oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA to its maximal yield of acetyl-CoA units (i.e., 8 acetyl-CoA) plus the associated reduced cofactors from $\\beta$-oxidation; we do not include tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidation of acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide, because that would not be “back to acetyl-CoA.”\n\nSynthesis of one mole of palmitate in the cytosol from mitochondrial acetyl-CoA requires eight acetyl groups: one acetyl-CoA primer and seven malonyl-CoA derived from seven acetyl-CoA.
