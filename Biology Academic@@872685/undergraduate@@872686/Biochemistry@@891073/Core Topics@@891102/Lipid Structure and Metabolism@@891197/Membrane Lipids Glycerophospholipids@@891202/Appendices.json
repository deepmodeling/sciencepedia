This exercise explores the concept of the phase transition temperature ($T_m$), which marks the shift from a rigid, gel-like state to a fluid one [@problem_id:2056673]. By comparing lipids with saturated and unsaturated acyl chains, you will uncover the direct link between molecular structure and the macroscopic physical properties of the membrane, a key principle in understanding how cells adapt to their environment.", "problem": "In biochemistry, the physical properties of cell membranes are largely determined by their lipid composition. A key characteristic of a lipid bilayer is its phase transition temperature ($T_m$), which is the temperature at which it transitions from an ordered, gel-like state to a more disordered, fluid, liquid-crystalline state. This property is heavily influenced by the structure of the constituent glycerophospholipids.\n\nConsider two different, pure phosphatidylcholine lipids suspended in an aqueous solution to form bilayers:\n\n- **Lipid A**: 1,2-distearoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), which is composed of a glycerol backbone, a phosphocholine head group, and two acyl chains derived from stearic acid. Stearic acid is a saturated 18-carbon fatty acid (18:0).\n\n- **Lipid B**: 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (SOPC), which is composed of a glycerol backbone, a phosphocholine head group, one acyl chain from stearic acid (18:0), and one acyl chain from oleic acid. Oleic acid is an 18-carbon fatty acid that contains a single *cis*-double bond (18:1).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately compares the phase transition temperatures ($T_m$) of a bilayer made from pure Lipid A versus one made from pure Lipid B, and provides the correct physical reasoning?\n\nA. The bilayer of Lipid B will have a higher phase transition temperature than the bilayer of Lipid A because the double bond in Lipid B increases the rigidity of the hydrocarbon tail, leading to stronger intermolecular interactions.\nB. The bilayers of Lipid A and Lipid B will have nearly identical phase transition temperatures because both lipids have the same total number of carbon atoms in their acyl chains.\nC. The bilayer of Lipid B will have a lower phase transition temperature than the bilayer of Lipid A because the *cis*-double bond in Lipid B's oleoyl chain creates a kink that disrupts the orderly packing of the lipids, weakening the overall van der Waals forces between tails.\nD. The bilayer of Lipid B will have a lower phase transition temperature than the bilayer of Lipid A because the presence of a double bond makes the oleoyl chain more polar, which increases its interaction with water and destabilizes the bilayer.\nE. The bilayer of Lipid A will have a lower phase transition temperature than the bilayer of Lipid B because saturated chains are more flexible and thus require less energy to enter a disordered state.", "solution": "We compare the phase transition temperatures by considering the thermodynamic condition for the gel-to-liquid-crystalline transition, which occurs when the Gibbs free energy change for the transition is zero. For the transition,\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T_{m}\\Delta S = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_{m} = \\frac{\\Delta H}{\\Delta S}.\n$$\nThe enthalpy change $\\Delta H$ reflects the strength of cohesive interactions (primarily van der Waals dispersion forces) between hydrocarbon chains in the ordered gel phase relative to the disordered fluid phase. Tighter, more extended chain packing increases the stabilizing interactions of the gel phase, leading to a larger $\\Delta H$ and therefore a higher $T_{m}$, all else equal.\n\nLipid A (DSPC) has two saturated 18:0 chains. Saturated chains are straight and pack closely, maximizing van der Waals contact area and stabilizing the gel phase. Consequently, the enthalpy required to disrupt this packing is large, implying $\\Delta H_{A}$ is relatively large, and thus $T_{m,A}$ is high.\n\nLipid B (SOPC) has one saturated 18:0 chain and one cis-monounsaturated 18:1 chain. The *cis* double bond introduces a fixed kink in the oleoyl chain, which disrupts close packing, increases free volume, and reduces van der Waals contact area in the gel phase. This weakens the enthalpic stabilization of the gel relative to the fluid phase, so the enthalpy required for the transition is reduced, implying $\\Delta H_{B} < \\Delta H_{A}$. While $\\Delta S$ can vary, the dominant effect here is the reduction in $\\Delta H$, leading to\n$$\nT_{m,B} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{B}}{\\Delta S_{B}} < \\frac{\\Delta H_{A}}{\\Delta S_{A}} \\approx T_{m,A}.\n$$\nTherefore, the bilayer of Lipid B has a lower $T_{m}$ than that of Lipid A due to the kinked *cis* double bond disrupting orderly packing and weakening van der Waals interactions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: although the double bond is locally rigid, a *cis* double bond disrupts packing and weakens interactions, lowering $T_{m}$ rather than raising it.\n- B is incorrect: $T_{m}$ depends strongly on saturation and packing, not just total carbon number.\n- C is correct: the *cis*-double bond introduces a kink, disrupting packing and weakening van der Waals forces, which lowers $T_{m}$.\n- D is incorrect: the double bond does not make the hydrocarbon tail significantly polar; interactions with water remain minimal in the hydrophobic core.\n- E is incorrect: saturated chains pack more tightly and generally require more energy to disorder, so Lipid A has a higher, not lower, $T_{m}$.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2056673"}, {"introduction": "One of the most remarkable properties of lipids is their spontaneous self-assembly in water, which forms the basis of all cellular membranes. However, the final structure—be it a flat bilayer or a spherical micelle—is not random; it is dictated by the geometry of the individual lipid molecules [@problem_id:2056659]. This problem illustrates this core principle by asking why a two-chained phospholipid forms a bilayer while its single-chained lysophospholipid counterpart forms a micelle, revealing how molecular shape governs biological organization.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the self-assembly properties of glycerophospholipids in an aqueous buffer at neutral pH. Two molecules are synthesized for the study:\n\nMolecule I: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a typical phospholipid found in cell membranes, possessing a saturated 16-carbon palmitoyl chain and an unsaturated 18-carbon oleoyl chain.\n\nMolecule II: 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a lysophospholipid derivative created by removing the oleoyl chain from Molecule I.\n\nUpon dispersal in the aqueous buffer, the biochemist observes that Molecule I spontaneously forms stable vesicles, which are enclosed spherical structures based on a lipid bilayer. In contrast, Molecule II aggregates to form micelles, which are small, spherical, non-bilayer structures.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental explanation for this observed difference in the supramolecular aggregates formed by Molecule I and Molecule II?\n\nA. The presence of two fatty acyl chains in Molecule I results in an effective molecular geometry that is roughly cylindrical, which favors packing into a planar bilayer. In contrast, the single acyl chain in Molecule II gives it a cone-like or wedge-shaped geometry, which preferentially packs into a curved micelle.\nB. The phosphocholine head group in Molecule II is more sterically accessible to water molecules than in Molecule I, leading to a much stronger hydrophilic character that exclusively favors the formation of micelles over bilayers.\nC. Molecule I contains an unsaturated fatty acid (oleoyl chain), which introduces a \"kink\" that is essential for the stable formation of a fluid bilayer structure. Molecule II lacks this kink, preventing it from forming a bilayer.\nD. The enzymatic removal of the oleoyl chain alters the net charge of the phosphocholine head group in Molecule II, causing electrostatic repulsion that prevents the formation of an extended bilayer and favors smaller micellar aggregates.\nE. The melting temperature (Tm) of Molecule II is significantly higher than that of Molecule I. This higher Tm reflects stronger van der Waals interactions per molecule, which can only be accommodated within the tight packing of a micellar core.", "solution": "We apply the packing-geometry framework for amphiphiles, which predicts aggregate morphology from the critical packing parameter\n$$\nP=\\frac{v}{a_{0}l_{c}},\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the hydrocarbon chain volume, $a_{0}$ is the optimal headgroup interfacial area, and $l_{c}$ is the extended chain length. The general morphology map is: $P<\\frac{1}{3}$ favors spherical micelles, $\\frac{1}{3}<P<\\frac{1}{2}$ favors cylindrical micelles, and $\\frac{1}{2}\\lesssim P \\lesssim 1$ favors bilayers (lamellae). Values $P>1$ tend to favor inverted phases.\n\nFor both molecules, the headgroup is phosphocholine, so $a_{0}$ is determined primarily by the same zwitterionic headgroup. The dominant difference is in the hydrophobic region: Molecule I has two acyl chains (one saturated C16 and one unsaturated C18), whereas Molecule II has only one acyl chain (lyso form).\n\nIntroducing a second chain in Molecule I increases $v$ approximately in proportion to the number of chains, and also increases the effective cross-sectional area of the hydrophobic region such that the molecular shape approaches a cylinder. While $l_{c}$ may increase modestly with an additional chain, the ratio $v/(a_{0}l_{c})$ increases compared to the single-chain case because $a_{0}$ is largely set by the same headgroup and cannot shrink enough to compensate. Thus, for diacyl phosphatidylcholines, $P$ lies in the range that favors bilayers. This corresponds to an effectively cylindrical geometry.\n\nIn contrast, Molecule II with a single acyl chain has a much smaller $v$ and a similar $a_{0}$, so $P$ decreases. The molecule adopts a cone-like (wedge-shaped) geometry with $P<\\frac{1}{3}$, which favors spherical micelles. Therefore, the observed formation of vesicular bilayers by Molecule I and micelles by Molecule II is explained by the change in molecular geometry and the associated packing parameter.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- A states the packing-geometry explanation (cylindrical for two chains favoring bilayers; cone-like for one chain favoring micelles), which matches the $P$ analysis above. This is the fundamental reason.\n- B claims stronger hydrophilicity for Molecule II due to headgroup exposure, but both molecules have the same phosphocholine headgroup; the key variable is tail number and shape, not a fundamentally different headgroup hydrophilicity.\n- C emphasizes the unsaturation kink as essential for bilayers. While unsaturation modulates fluidity and transition temperatures, saturated diacyl phosphatidylcholines also form bilayers; the decisive difference here is not the kink but the number of chains (shape/packing).\n- D asserts a change in net headgroup charge upon deacylation; phosphocholine remains zwitterionic with zero net charge at neutral pH in both molecules, so this is incorrect.\n- E invokes a higher melting temperature to favor micelles; melting temperature reflects chain packing and fluidity within a given phase but does not impose micellar versus bilayer morphology, which is governed by $P$.\n\nThus, the most fundamental explanation is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2056659"}]}
