This enzyme facilitates the transfer of electrons from the reduced form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) to Coenzyme Q (Q), also known as ubiquinone. The overall process involves the transfer of two electrons ($n=2$).\n\nThe standard biochemical reduction potentials ($E'^\\circ$) for the two relevant half-reactions are:\n1. $\\text{NAD}^+ + \\text{H}^+ + 2e^- \\rightarrow \\text{NADH}$ ; $E'^\\circ = -0.320$ V\n2. $\\text{Q} + 2\\text{H}^+ + 2e^- \\rightarrow \\text{QH}_2$ ; $E'^\\circ = +0.045$ V\n\nUsing the Faraday constant, $F = 96.485 \\text{ kJ V}^{-1} \\text{mol}^{-1}$, determine the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G'^\\circ$) for the overall spontaneous reaction and the direction of that electron flow.

The NADH that fuels Complex I is primarily generated from the catabolism of carbohydrates and fats. This exercise connects the dots between the breakdown of a key metabolic intermediate, pyruvate, and the proton-pumping action of Complex I, allowing you to quantify its contribution to building the essential proton-motive force [@problem_id:2036128].", "problem": "The complete aerobic respiration of metabolic fuels involves a series of catabolic pathways that generate reduced electron carriers, which then donate their electrons to the electron transport chain. Consider the complete oxidation of a single molecule of pyruvate to three molecules of carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) within the mitochondrial matrix. The reduced electron carriers produced during this process fuel the pumping of protons, establishing the proton-motive force for ATP synthesis.\n\nAssume that for every molecule of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) that is oxidized, Complex I (NADH-Q oxidoreductase) translocates exactly 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space.\n\nCalculate the total number of protons translocated specifically by Complex I as a consequence of the complete oxidation of this single pyruvate molecule.

This final practice moves from theory to application, challenging you to interpret the results of a common laboratory technique used to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction. By analyzing hypothetical data from a Blue Native PAGE experiment, you will learn to distinguish between a deficiency in the amount of Complex I and a defect in its catalytic activity, a critical skill in biochemical diagnostics [@problem_id:2036162].", "problem": "Two patients, Patient A and Patient B, present with muscle weakness and exercise intolerance, symptoms suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. Biochemical analysis of their muscle biopsy tissues reveals that the total activity of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the electron transport chain is significantly reduced in both patients compared to a healthy control. Two distinct molecular hypotheses are proposed to explain these findings:\n\n*   **Hypothesis for Patient A:** A mutation leads to decreased stability of a key structural subunit, resulting in a significantly reduced total quantity of the fully assembled, but otherwise functional, Complex I.\n*   **Hypothesis for Patient B:** A point mutation in a crucial catalytic residue renders the enzyme completely inactive (\"catalytically dead\"), but does not disrupt its overall structure, stability, or ability to assemble into the full complex. The total quantity of assembled Complex I is normal.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, you perform an experiment on mitochondrial extracts from the Control, Patient A, and Patient B. The samples are first separated by Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), a technique that separates intact protein complexes based on their size. After electrophoresis, the gel is incubated in a solution containing NADH and nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT), a colorless compound. Active Complex I can use NADH to reduce NBT into a dark-purple, insoluble formazan precipitate, revealing the location of the active enzyme as a visible band.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the expected results for the purple formazan bands in the in-gel activity assay?\n\nA. Control: A distinct purple band. Patient A: A faint purple band at the same migration position as the control. Patient B: No purple band is observed.\nB. Control: A distinct purple band. Patient A: No purple band is observed. Patient B: A faint purple band at the same migration position as the control.\nC. Control: A distinct purple band. Patient A: A distinct purple band that has migrated a shorter distance than the control band. Patient B: A distinct purple band that has migrated a longer distance than the control band.\nD. The experiment is unable to distinguish between the two patients. Both Patient A and Patient B will show a faint purple band at the same migration position as the control.\nE. Control: A distinct purple band. Patient A: A faint purple band at the same migration position as the control. Patient B: A distinct purple band at the same migration position as the control.", "solution": "We apply the principles of Blue Native PAGE followed by in-gel activity staining with NADH and nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT). BN-PAGE separates intact respiratory supercomplexes or complexes primarily by size while preserving native structure and assembly state. After electrophoresis, the gel is incubated with NADH and NBT. Active Complex I transfers electrons from NADH to an artificial electron acceptor; in this assay, NBT serves as the terminal electron acceptor, being reduced to an insoluble purple formazan precipitate at the location of catalytically active Complex I. Therefore:\n- The presence of a purple band indicates catalytically active Complex I at that migration position.\n- The band intensity correlates with the amount of active Complex I present.\n- The migration position reflects the intact assembly state and overall size of the complex; if the complex is fully assembled and structurally intact, its migration should match the control.\n\nFor Patient A (reduced stability of a structural subunit leading to significantly reduced total quantity of fully assembled, but otherwise functional, Complex I): The fully assembled complexes that remain are catalytically competent. Thus, after BN-PAGE, the active complexes will reduce NBT, yielding a purple band at the same migration position as control, but with reduced intensity due to the lower quantity of assembled, active Complex I. Expected: a faint purple band at the control position.\n\nFor Patient B (catalytically dead mutation with normal assembly and quantity): The complex is present in normal amounts and migrates as the intact complex, but it lacks catalytic activity. Since the in-gel assay detects activity-dependent NBT reduction, no purple formazan will form at the Complex I position despite normal assembly and quantity. Expected: no purple band.\n\nThe healthy control shows a distinct purple band at the characteristic Complex I migration position, reflecting normal abundance and activity.\n\nThese expectations match option A: Control distinct band; Patient A faint band at the same position; Patient B no band.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2036162"}]}
