This process is essential for maximizing ATP production from glycolysis. The shuttle involves enzymes and transporters in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. One of the key enzymes in this shuttle is aspartate aminotransferase, which exists as isozymes in both compartments.

Pyruvate and Aspartate", "solution": "The malate-aspartate shuttle transfers cytosolic reducing equivalents into the mitochondrial matrix by cycling carbon skeletons and amino groups between cytosol and matrix. A central reversible reaction is the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) transamination, which swaps the amino group between an amino acid and a keto acid. The general principle for aminotransferases is:\n$$\\text{amino acid}_{1} + \\text{keto acid}_{2} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{keto acid}_{1} + \\text{amino acid}_{2}.$$\nFor aspartate aminotransferase, the specific reversible reaction is:\n$$\\text{oxaloacetate} + \\text{glutamate} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{aspartate} + \\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate}.$$\nIn the malate-aspartate shuttle, mitochondrial oxaloacetate is transaminated to aspartate in the matrix and exported. In the cytosol, to regenerate cytosolic oxaloacetate for reduction to malate (and thus continue the shuttle), cytosolic AST operates in the reverse direction of the above equation, using as substrates aspartate and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate to produce oxaloacetate and glutamate:\n$$\\text{aspartate} + \\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate} \\rightarrow \\text{oxaloacetate} + \\text{glutamate}.$$\nTherefore, the two primary substrates for cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase in the direction that regenerates cytosolic oxaloacetate are aspartate and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate, which corresponds to option C.
