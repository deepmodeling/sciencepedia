The cells are initially maintained in a culture medium with an abundant supply of glucose and oxygen, allowing them to perform aerobic respiration efficiently. The system is in a steady state.

The ratio increases because the electron transport chain is inhibited, preventing the re-oxidation of NADH to NAD⁺.\nB.

Let $[\\mathrm{NADH}]$ and $[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ denote intracellular concentrations, and let the ratio be $R = [\\mathrm{NADH}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$. The time rate of change of $[\\mathrm{NADH}]$ can be expressed schematically as\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{NADH}]}{dt} = v_{\\text{GAPDH}} + v_{\\text{TCA}} - v_{\\text{ETC}} - v_{\\text{LDH}} - \\cdots,\n$$\nwhere $v_{\\text{GAPDH}}$ is the cytosolic production of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in glycolysis, $v_{\\text{TCA}}$ is mitochondrial production of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ by the citric acid cycle, $v_{\\text{ETC}}$ is the mitochondrial consumption (reoxidation) of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ by the electron transport chain, and $v_{\\text{LDH}}$ is the cytosolic consumption of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ by lactate dehydrogenase.
