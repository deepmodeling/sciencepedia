{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the first steps in characterizing a protein is to determine its quaternary structure—that is, how many polypeptide subunits it contains. This practice provides a foundational exercise in biochemical problem-solving, challenging you to integrate data from two common laboratory techniques: size-exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE. By comparing the protein's size in its native state to the size of its individual components after denaturation, you can deduce its subunit composition, a crucial piece of its structural puzzle [@problem_id:2068507].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a newly isolated enzyme. To determine its structure, a series of experiments are conducted. First, size-exclusion chromatography, a technique that preserves the native protein structure, indicates the enzyme has a total molecular weight of approximately 120 kDa.\n\nNext, the protein is analyzed using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This technique involves treating the protein with a detergent (SDS) that disrupts non-covalent interactions and unfolds the polypeptide chains, which are then separated by electrophoresis based almost exclusively on their molecular weight. This first SDS-PAGE experiment reveals a single distinct band corresponding to a molecular weight of 30 kDa.\n\nA second SDS-PAGE experiment is then performed, but this time, in addition to SDS, a strong reducing agent (beta-mercaptoethanol) is added. This agent specifically cleaves covalent disulfide bonds. The result of this second experiment is identical to the first: a single band is observed at 30 kDa.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the enzyme's quaternary structure?\n\nA. The enzyme is a monomer of 120 kDa that is partially cleaved into four 30 kDa fragments by the SDS.\n\nB. The enzyme is a dimer composed of two identical 60 kDa subunits.\n\nC. The enzyme is a tetramer composed of four identical 30 kDa subunits linked by non-covalent interactions.\n\nD. The enzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two subunits of 30 kDa and one subunit of 60 kDa.\n\nE. The enzyme is a tetramer where two pairs of 30 kDa subunits are each linked by disulfide bonds, and these two resulting 60 kDa dimers then associate non-covalently.", "solution": "Size-exclusion chromatography preserves the native, non-denatured state of a protein, so the elution corresponds to the native oligomeric molecular mass. From the experiment, the native mass is approximately $120\\ \\text{kDa}$, which we denote as $M_{\\text{native}} \\approx 120\\ \\text{kDa}$.\n\nSDS-PAGE denatures proteins by disrupting non-covalent interactions and coating polypeptide chains with SDS so that they migrate primarily according to their polypeptide chain molecular mass. The first SDS-PAGE gives a single band at $30\\ \\text{kDa}$, which implies that each polypeptide chain has mass $M_{\\text{subunit}} = 30\\ \\text{kDa}$ and that all chains are the same, since only one band is observed.\n\nA follow-up SDS-PAGE with a reducing agent (beta-mercaptoethanol) breaks disulfide bonds. The result is unchanged (still a single band at $30\\ \\text{kDa}$), so there are no interchain disulfide bonds linking subunits in the native state; otherwise, a difference between non-reducing and reducing conditions would have been observed.\n\nTo relate native mass and subunit mass, we use the relation\n$$\nn = \\frac{M_{\\text{native}}}{M_{\\text{subunit}}} = \\frac{120\\ \\text{kDa}}{30\\ \\text{kDa}} = 4,\n$$\nso the enzyme is a tetramer composed of four identical $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits. Because reducing conditions did not alter the SDS-PAGE pattern, the quaternary structure is maintained by non-covalent interactions rather than disulfide bonds.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because SDS does not cleave peptide bonds to generate smaller fragments; it denatures and separates existing polypeptide chains.\n- B is inconsistent with the $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ SDS-PAGE band; a $60\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunit would appear at $60\\ \\text{kDa}$.\n- C matches the data: a $120\\ \\text{kDa}$ native complex, single $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ band under both non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE, indicating four identical $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits associated non-covalently.\n- D is internally inconsistent (described as a heterotetramer but listing only three subunits) and would produce multiple bands (at least $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ and $60\\ \\text{kDa}$) on SDS-PAGE.\n- E predicts a $60\\ \\text{kDa}$ band under non-reducing SDS-PAGE due to disulfide-linked dimers, which contradicts the observed $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ band.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is a non-covalently associated tetramer of four identical $30\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2068507"}, {"introduction": "Subunits in a protein complex are often held together by non-covalent forces, but sometimes stronger, covalent links are involved.

To investigate its subunit composition, the biologist performs Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under two different conditions.\n\nIn the first experiment (non-reducing conditions), a pure sample of STS1 is treated with SDS and then loaded onto the gel. This results in the observation of a single, distinct band corresponding to a molecular weight of 220 kDa.\n\nIn the second experiment (reducing conditions), another sample of pure STS1 is treated with SDS and a powerful reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), before being loaded onto the gel.

Under non-reducing conditions, disulfide bonds remain intact; under reducing conditions (e.g., with DTT), disulfide bonds are cleaved to free thiols.\n\nObservation 1 (non-reducing): A pure STS1 sample treated with SDS (no DTT) gives a single band at $220\\ \\text{kDa}$. Because SDS disrupts non-covalent interactions, any multimer observed under non-reducing conditions must be held together by covalent disulfide bonds. The single band at $220\\ \\text{kDa}$ thus represents the intact, disulfide-linked assembly.\n\nObservation 2 (reducing): A pure STS1 sample treated with SDS and DTT gives a single band at $110\\ \\text{kDa}$. Reduction breaks disulfide bonds, so the observed band corresponds to the mass of the individual subunit(s). The fact that there is a single band implies that all constituent subunits have the same mass, namely $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ (i.e., a homomer).\n\nInference from the mass shift: The transition from $220\\ \\text{kDa}$ (non-reducing) to $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ (reducing) indicates that the native assembly is composed of two identical $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits linked by one or more disulfide bonds, summing to $220\\ \\text{kDa}$ when the disulfide linkage is intact.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- A: DTT does not cleave peptide backbones; a monomer of $220\\ \\text{kDa}$ would not become $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ upon reduction. Therefore A is incorrect.\n- B: If subunits were held exclusively by non-covalent interactions, SDS alone would dissociate them even without DTT, yielding $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ under non-reducing conditions, not $220\\ \\text{kDa}$. Therefore B is incorrect.\n- C: A tetramer of $55\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits with disulfide-linked pairs would give $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ under non-reducing conditions (disulfide-linked dimers) and $55\\ \\text{kDa}$ under reducing conditions, which is not observed. Therefore C is incorrect.\n- E: A non-covalent heterodimer would dissociate with SDS under non-reducing conditions, yielding separate bands for distinct subunits; also the observed single $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ band argues against heterogeneity. Therefore E is incorrect.\n\nThus, the data are best explained by a disulfide-linked homodimer of two $110\\ \\text{kDa}$ subunits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2334500"}, {"introduction": "The stability of a protein's quaternary structure is not absolute; it depends critically on the chemical environment and the nature of the amino acids at the subunit interface. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2068499] shifts our focus from composition to the physicochemical principles of assembly, asking you to identify which amino acid residues are responsible for a protein's pH-dependent dissociation. Solving this requires applying your knowledge of amino acid pKa values to explain how changes in pH can alter electrostatic interactions and either hold a complex together or drive it apart.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a novel homotrimeric protein called \"Dissociase\". The three identical subunits of Dissociase assemble into a stable complex in a buffer solution at pH 8.0. However, when the pH of the buffer is adjusted to 6.0, the trimer completely dissociates into its individual monomeric subunits. This dissociation is known to be caused by a change in electrostatic forces at the interface between the subunits.\n\nGiven that the dissociation is primarily due to the ionization state of one or more amino acid residues in close proximity at the interface, which of the following pairs of residues is most likely responsible for this pH-dependent behavior?\n\nYou are provided with the typical side chain pKa values for several amino acids:\n- Aspartic Acid (Asp): 3.9\n- Glutamic Acid (Glu): 4.1\n- Histidine (His): 6.0\n- Cysteine (Cys): 8.3\n- Tyrosine (Tyr): 10.5\n- Lysine (Lys): 10.5\n- Arginine (Arg): 12.5\n\nA) Two Lysine residues\n\nB) An Aspartic Acid residue and a Lysine residue\n\nC) Two Histidine residues\n\nD) A Cysteine residue and a Tyrosine residue\n\nE) Two Glutamic Acid residues", "solution": "We use the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationships to connect pH to side-chain protonation and charge, because electrostatic interactions at the interface depend on whether side chains are protonated (charged) or deprotonated (neutral for bases, negative for acids).\n\nFor an acidic side chain written as $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+}+A^{-}$, the deprotonated (negatively charged) fraction is\n$$\nf_{A^{-}}=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a}-\\mathrm{pH}}}.\n$$\nThus, when $\\mathrm{pH}>\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, acids are predominantly deprotonated and negatively charged.\n\nFor a basic side chain written as $BH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons B+H^{+}$, the protonated (positively charged) fraction is\n$$\nf_{BH^{+}}=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}.\n$$\nThus, when $\\mathrm{pH}<\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, bases are predominantly protonated and positively charged; when $\\mathrm{pH}>\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, they are largely deprotonated and neutral.\n\nThe observation is: trimer is stable at $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and dissociates at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$. Therefore, lowering pH must introduce new electrostatic repulsion or remove a stabilizing opposite-charge interaction at the interface.\n\nEvaluate each option using $\\mathrm{pH}$ relative to the given $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ values:\n- Two Lysine residues (basic with high $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$): for both $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, we have $\\mathrm{pH}<\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, so both Lys are positively charged at both pH values. The like-charge repulsion exists at both pH values and does not newly appear at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, so this does not explain stability at $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ but dissociation at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$.\n- Aspartic Acid and Lysine (acidic plus basic): at both $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}>\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Asp})$ so Asp is negative, and $\\mathrm{pH}<\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Lys})$ so Lys is positive. The salt bridge persists across both pH values; no disruptive change occurs at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$.\n- Two Histidine residues (basic with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ near neutral): at $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}>\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{His})$, so His is largely deprotonated and neutral, minimizing like-charge repulsion and allowing stable packing. At $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}\\approx \\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{His})$, so a substantial fraction (increasing as $\\mathrm{pH}$ drops below $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$) becomes protonated and positively charged. Two nearby His side chains thus acquire like positive charges, introducing electrostatic repulsion at lower pH that can destabilize the interface and promote dissociation. This matches the observed pH-dependent dissociation upon lowering pH.\n- Cysteine and Tyrosine: $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Cys})$ is above neutral, so at $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ there can be some deprotonated thiolate (negative), whereas at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$ Cys is predominantly protonated (neutral). Tyrosine remains neutral at both $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$ because $\\mathrm{pH}\\ll \\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Tyr})$. Lowering pH reduces any negative charge on Cys, which would not create new repulsion; it would more likely reduce repulsion and cannot explain destabilization at lower pH.\n- Two Glutamic Acid residues: for both $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}>\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\text{Glu})$, so both are negatively charged across both pH values. Any like-charge repulsion is present at both pH values and would not specifically increase upon lowering pH to $6.0$.\n\nOnly the two-histidine scenario introduces a significant and specific charge-state change between $\\mathrm{pH}=8.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$ that can convert a neutral-neutral contact into a like-charge repulsive contact, thereby explaining the pH-triggered dissociation at lower pH.
