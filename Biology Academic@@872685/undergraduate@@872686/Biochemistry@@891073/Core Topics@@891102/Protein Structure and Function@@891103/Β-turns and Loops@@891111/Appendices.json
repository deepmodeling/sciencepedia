A standard β-turn is composed of four consecutive amino acid residues. The turn's conformation is stabilized by a single, characteristic hydrogen bond formed between the main-chain atoms of two of these four residues.\n\nConsider a tetrapeptide segment within a larger protein that forms a β-turn.

The carbonyl oxygen is from Glycine, and the amide hydrogen is from Aspartic acid.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must apply the definition of a β-turn and its stabilizing hydrogen bond to the given peptide sequence.\n\nA standard β-turn involves four consecutive amino acid residues. By convention, these residues are numbered sequentially as residue $i$, residue $i+1$, residue $i+2$, and residue $i+3$.\n\nFor the given sequence Alanine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine, we can assign the numbering as follows:\n- Residue $i$: Alanine (Ala)\n- Residue $i+1$: Glycine (Gly)\n- Residue $i+2$: Aspartic acid (Asp)\n- Residue $i+3$: Serine (Ser)\n\nThe defining structural feature of a β-turn is a hydrogen bond that forms between the main-chain atoms of the first and the fourth residues in the turn. Specifically, the hydrogen bond is formed between the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue $i$ and the amide hydrogen atom of residue $i+3$. The carbonyl oxygen acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor, while the amide hydrogen acts as the hydrogen bond donor.\n\nApplying this rule to our specific sequence:\n- The carbonyl oxygen ($C=O$) is provided by the peptide backbone of residue $i$. In this case, residue $i$ is Alanine.\n- The amide hydrogen ($N-H$) is provided by the peptide backbone of residue $i+3$. In this case, residue $i+3$ is Serine.\n\nTherefore, the hydrogen bond forms between the carbonyl oxygen of Alanine and the amide hydrogen of Serine.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The carbonyl oxygen is from Alanine, and the amide hydrogen is from Serine. This matches our conclusion.\nB. The carbonyl oxygen is from Alanine (residue $i$), and the amide hydrogen is from Aspartic acid (residue $i+2$). This describes a hydrogen bond between residues $i$ and $i+2$, which is not characteristic of a standard β-turn.\nC. The carbonyl oxygen is from Glycine (residue $i+1$), and the amide hydrogen is from Serine (residue $i+3$). This describes a hydrogen bond between residues $i+1$ and $i+3$, which is incorrect.\nD. The carbonyl oxygen is from Serine (residue $i+3$), and the amide hydrogen is from Alanine (residue $i$). This incorrectly reverses the roles of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. The oxygen atom is the acceptor, and the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen is the donor.\nE. The carbonyl oxygen is from Glycine (residue $i+1$), and the amide hydrogen is from Aspartic acid (residue $i+2$).

This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario involving an enzyme where a single mutation in a functional loop has dramatic consequences. It specifically explores the unique and vital role of glycine, whose minimal side chain allows it to occupy sterically constrained positions in tight turns that are inaccessible to other residues, thereby enabling essential conformational changes for catalysis. [@problem_id:2088579]", "problem": "A hypothetical enzyme, “Catalysin,” possesses a deep active site cleft. The entrance to this cleft is regulated by a flexible surface loop that connects two antiparallel β-strands. For the substrate to enter the active site, this loop must undergo a significant conformational change, folding back upon itself in a tight β-turn. Sequence analysis of Catalysin and its homologs reveals a highly conserved glycine residue at the most constrained position within this turn. A research group engineers a mutant version of Catalysin by replacing this critical glycine with a tryptophan residue.\n\nAssuming the mutation does not prevent the initial transcription and translation of the polypeptide chain, which of the following statements describes the most likely and direct consequence of this glycine-to-tryptophan mutation on the structure and function of Catalysin?\n\nA. The newly introduced tryptophan will form a stronger hydrogen bond network within the loop, increasing the thermal stability of the enzyme but not affecting its catalytic activity.\nB. The loop will become more flexible, allowing the substrate to access the active site more rapidly and thereby increasing the overall reaction rate.\nC. The bulky side chain of tryptophan will cause a steric clash, preventing the loop from adopting the tight turn conformation necessary for substrate binding, thus leading to a significant loss of enzyme activity.\nD. The substitution will have no significant effect on the enzyme's structure or function because surface loops are inherently disordered and not critical for the protein's core fold.\nE. The tryptophan residue will be post-translationally modified to mimic the properties of glycine, restoring the original function of the enzyme.", "solution": "We identify the relevant structural and functional principles governing loop-mediated access to an active site and the role of residues in tight turns.\n\n1) Structural constraint of tight turns:\n- Tight turns, particularly at the apex of a loop connecting antiparallel $\\beta$-strands, impose strong constraints on backbone dihedral angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$.\n- Glycine is uniquely suited for such positions because it lacks a side chain beyond hydrogen, permitting access to regions of the Ramachandran plot that are sterically forbidden for other residues. This accommodates the high curvature required for a tight $\\beta$-turn.\n\n2) Conservation and functional inference:\n- The glycine at the most constrained position is highly conserved across homologs, indicating strong functional selection, typically due to steric and conformational requirements of the loop conformation necessary for substrate gating.\n\n3) Effect of replacing glycine with tryptophan:\n- Tryptophan possesses a bulky indole side chain. This introduces steric bulk near the backbone, restricting the set of accessible $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ angles and disfavoring tight curvature required for the turn.\n- The increased steric hindrance and reduced conformational freedom directly oppose the loop’s ability to fold back into the tight $\\beta$-turn conformation.\n- As the loop regulates entrance to a deep active site cleft, failure to adopt the necessary turn conformation will impair opening or proper positioning of the loop, thereby obstructing substrate access and/or proper binding geometry.\n\n4) Assessing the given options:\n- A: Incorrect. Tryptophan does not generally form stronger hydrogen-bond networks in loops; it is bulky and largely hydrophobic. Moreover, a mutation at a conserved, constrained turn would be expected to impact function if gating is required for catalysis.\n- B: Incorrect. Glycine is the most flexible residue; replacing it with tryptophan reduces, not increases, flexibility and conformational accessibility.\n- C: Correct. The bulky tryptophan side chain is likely to cause steric clashes and prevent formation of the tight turn essential for substrate access, directly leading to decreased or lost catalytic activity.\n- D: Incorrect. Although loops can be flexible, this loop is functionally critical for gating. Conservation of glycine indicates structural and functional importance.\n- E: Incorrect. There is no known post-translational modification that converts tryptophan to mimic glycine’s steric properties.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and direct consequence is steric hindrance preventing the necessary tight turn and thereby diminishing enzyme activity due to impaired substrate binding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2088579"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of understanding is the ability to apply principles in a design challenge. This final practice requires you to engineer a β-turn that can function within the complex, dual environment of a cell membrane.

These strands are connected by a short, four-residue loop that forms a perfect Type II β-turn. For the protein to fold and embed correctly, this turn must be amphipathic. Structural analysis reveals that the plane of the β-turn is oriented perpendicular to the membrane surface. This orientation causes the side chains of the residues at positions $i$ and $i+2$ of the turn (where the four residues are numbered $i, i+1, i+2, i+3$) to project directly into the hydrophobic lipid acyl chain environment of the membrane.

Therefore, to be amphipathic and energetically favorable, residues at $i$ and $i+2$ should be hydrophobic, while residues at $i+1$ and $i+3$ should be polar or charged.\n- A perfect Type II β-turn has characteristic backbone dihedral angles at the central residues such that the residue at position $i+2$ adopts a positive $\\phi$ angle (approximately $\\phi \\approx 80^{\\circ}$), which is sterically allowed essentially only for glycine. Thus, glycine is strongly preferred at position $i+2$. Conversely, proline at $i+2$ is incompatible with these dihedral requirements due to its restricted $\\phi$ angle.\n\nEvaluate each option against these two requirements (amphipathic orientation and Type II β-turn stereochemistry):\n- A. Valine (hydrophobic) at $i$ suits the lipid exposure; Serine (polar) at $i+1$ suits solvent; Glycine at $i+2$ satisfies the Type II requirement and is acceptable projecting toward lipid; Aspartate (charged) at $i+3$ suits solvent. This matches both constraints.\n- B. Serine at $i$ (polar) would face lipid and is unfavorable; Valine at $i+1$ (hydrophobic) would face solvent and is unfavorable; although Glycine at $i+2$ is correct for Type II, the amphipathic pattern is violated.\n- C. Proline at $i+2$ is incompatible with a Type II β-turn due to its restricted backbone geometry; thus this option is excluded despite amphipathic aspects.\n- D. Isoleucine at $i$ and Alanine at $i+2$ are hydrophobic and fit the amphipathic requirement; Asparagine at $i+1$ and Glutamine at $i+3$ are polar and solvent-exposed, which is favorable. However, Alanine at $i+2$ is strongly disfavored for a perfect Type II β-turn because the required positive $\\phi$ is not accessible to standard L-amino acids other than glycine.\n- E. Glycine at $i$ would place a non-hydrophobic side chain into the lipid and Serine at $i+2$ places a polar side chain into lipid; furthermore, glycine is not at $i+2$, so this violates both amphipathic and Type II preferences.\n\nTherefore, only option A simultaneously satisfies the amphipathic orientation and the stereochemical requirement of a perfect Type II β-turn (glycine at $i+2$), making it the most plausible and energetically stable choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2088595"}]}
