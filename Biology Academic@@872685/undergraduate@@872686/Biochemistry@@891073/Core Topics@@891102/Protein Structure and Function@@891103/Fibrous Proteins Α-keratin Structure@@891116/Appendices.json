A residue contributes favorably if it can adopt the required backbone dihedral angles and participate in the hydrogen-bonding pattern without introducing steric or conformational strain.\n\n- Proline has a cyclic side chain bonded to the backbone nitrogen, creating a secondary amine that lacks an amide hydrogen. Therefore, proline cannot donate the backbone N–H needed for the $i \\to i+4$ hydrogen bond. Additionally, its rigid ring severely restricts the backbone $\\phi$ angle, commonly disrupting the helical geometry. Thus, proline is a classical \"helix breaker.\"\n- Glycine is highly flexible due to its small side chain, which increases conformational entropy and can destabilize helices, but it does not inherently abolish the backbone hydrogen-bonding capability; its effect is generally less severe than proline’s in breaking a continuous helix.\n- Alanine is among the strongest helix formers due to excellent steric compatibility with helical dihedrals.\n- Leucine and methionine are also favorable or at least compatible with $\\alpha$-helical conformations and are commonly found in helices, including in coiled-coils.\n\nGiven these established properties, the single amino acid most likely to act as a helix breaker in the sequence Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Ala is proline.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2046853"}, {"introduction": "With stable $\\alpha$-helices formed, the next step in building $\\alpha$-keratin is their assembly into a coiled-coil dimer.

This superhelical twisting is stabilized by a specific, repeating amino acid sequence pattern known as a heptad repeat. The heptad repeat is a seven-residue pattern, commonly denoted by the letters `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The stability of the coiled-coil interface depends critically on the identity of the amino acids at positions `a` and `d`. These two positions form a \"hydrophobic stripe\" that buries itself in the core of the two-helix structure. Consequently, positions `a` and `d` are almost always occupied by nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine, Methionine). Positions `e` and `g`, which are located on the outer surface of the interface, are often occupied by charged amino acids (e.g., Lysine, Arginine, Glutamate, Aspartate), allowing for stabilizing ionic interactions between the two helices.\n\nA biochemist has isolated a novel protein from a thermophilic bacterium and sequenced a short fragment of it.

Here, `e` positions are Gln (polar) and Lys (positively charged); `g` positions are Ala and Val (hydrophobic).

While charged residues at `g` can be favorable, hydrophobic residues at `g` do not make the sequence a poor candidate by themselves, especially when `a`/`d` are optimal.\n- E: False.

Desolvation penalty: removing the serine hydroxyl from water without providing compensatory hydrogen bonding interactions raises the free energy.\n2.
