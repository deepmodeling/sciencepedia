Inside these cells, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the rapid hydration of $\\text{CO}_2$ to form carbonic acid ($\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3$), which then spontaneously dissociates into a bicarbonate ion ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$) and a proton ($\\text{H}^+$).\n\nTo facilitate the continuous transport of large amounts of $\\text{CO}_2$, the majority of the newly formed bicarbonate is transported out of the red blood cell into the blood plasma. To maintain electrical neutrality, this movement is coupled to the transport of a chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) in the opposite direction by an anion exchange protein in the red blood cell membrane. This entire process is reversible and its direction depends on the relative partial pressures of $\\text{CO}_2$ in the surrounding environment.\n\nConsidering the physiological conditions in the capillaries of an actively respiring muscle and in the capillaries of the lungs, which of the following statements correctly describes the net direction of movement for bicarbonate ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$) and chloride ($\\text{Cl}^-$) ions across the red blood cell membrane?\n\nA.

This organism possesses a hemoglobin-like protein for oxygen transport. Subsequent analysis reveals a unique mutation: while the protein still binds four oxygen molecules cooperatively, it completely lacks the specific histidine residues that normally accept protons. As a result, this modified hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen is unaffected by changes in pH. The organism survives in its environment, but its physiology is distinct from terrestrial life.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence for oxygen transport in *X. profundus* as it transitions from a state of rest to a state of high metabolic activity, such as evading a predator?\n\nA. The total oxygen-carrying capacity of its circulatory fluid would be significantly decreased because hemoglobin cannot be properly regulated.\nB. The efficiency of oxygen loading onto hemoglobin at its respiratory surfaces would be greatly enhanced, allowing for faster oxygen uptake from the vent fluid.\nC. The transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the respiratory surfaces would be the primary function impaired, leading to severe acidosis.\nD. The hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen would remain undesirably high in the metabolically active tissues, resulting in inefficient oxygen release to those tissues.\nE. The cooperative binding of oxygen would be lost, causing the oxygen-binding curve to become hyperbolic instead of sigmoidal.", "solution": "We interpret the mutation as eliminating proton-binding residues on the hemoglobin-like protein that mediate the Bohr effect. The Bohr effect in typical hemoglobin can be expressed as a pH dependence of the apparent dissociation constant or of the half-saturation pressure. Let $P_{50}$ denote the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is half-saturated and $n$ the Hill coefficient. For cooperative binding with four sites, the saturation $S$ follows the Hill equation:\n$$\nS=\\frac{(p\\mathrm{O}_{2})^{n}}{(p\\mathrm{O}_{2})^{n}+P_{50}^{n}}.\n$$\nIn conventional hemoglobin, the Bohr effect implies that a decrease in pH (as occurs in metabolically active tissues with high $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production and lactic acid generation) increases $P_{50}$ (a right shift), i.e.,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_{50}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}<0,\n$$\nso that lowering pH increases $P_{50}$ and reduces affinity, facilitating oxygen unloading.\n\nThe problem states that the modified hemoglobin still binds four $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules cooperatively (so $n>1$ is preserved), but its affinity is unaffected by pH because the specific histidine residues that normally accept protons are absent. Therefore, the pH dependence is abolished:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_{50}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}=0.\n$$\nConsequently, when metabolism increases and tissue pH falls, the usual rightward shift that promotes oxygen unloading does not occur. At a given tissue $p\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the saturation $S$ remains higher than it would under a normal Bohr response, so less oxygen is released to the tissues. This specifically impairs oxygen unloading in active tissues.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\n- A is incorrect because total oxygen-carrying capacity is determined by the concentration of hemoglobin and the number of heme sites (four per tetramer). The mutation does not change the number of binding sites or their occupancy at high $p\\mathrm{O}_{2}$; regulation by pH does not set capacity.\n\n- B is incorrect because loading at the respiratory surface is not “greatly enhanced” by removing pH sensitivity. In typical systems, higher pH at the respiratory surface would left-shift the curve to aid loading; abolishing pH dependence removes that benefit rather than enhancing loading.\n\n- C is primarily about carbon dioxide transport. While loss of proton acceptor sites can reduce buffering capacity and alter the Haldane effect, the question asks for the primary consequence for oxygen transport during a rest-to-activity transition. The dominant effect on oxygen transport is impaired unloading due to loss of the Bohr effect.\n\n- D is correct. Without the Bohr effect, the hemoglobin maintains higher affinity in acidified, metabolically active tissues, limiting oxygen release.\n\n- E is incorrect because cooperativity is explicitly stated to be preserved.\n\nThus, the primary consequence for oxygen transport during high metabolic activity is inefficient oxygen release in tissues due to persistently high affinity in the absence of the Bohr effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2080279"}]}
