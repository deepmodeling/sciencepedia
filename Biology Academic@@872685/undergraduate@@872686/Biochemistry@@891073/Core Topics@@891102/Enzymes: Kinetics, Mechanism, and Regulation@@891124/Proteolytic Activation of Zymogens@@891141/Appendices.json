The activation of digestive enzymes is a perfect example of a precisely controlled cascade. This exercise [@problem_id:2067457] asks you to explore the physiological consequences of a failure in the initial, critical activation step, reinforcing the importance of trypsin as the master activator in protein digestion.", "problem": "The process of protein digestion in the human small intestine relies on the coordinated action of several proteolytic enzymes. These enzymes are synthesized and secreted by the pancreas in their inactive precursor forms, known as zymogens. This mechanism prevents the enzymes from digesting the tissues of the pancreas itself. Upon entering the duodenum, these zymogens must be activated. The process is initiated by the enzyme enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase), which is bound to the membrane of the intestinal mucosal cells. Enteropeptidase specifically activates trypsinogen by cleaving a small peptide from its N-terminus, converting it into the active enzyme trypsin. This initial activation is a critical control point. Once formed, trypsin itself acts as a protease to activate other pancreatic zymogens, including chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, and proelastase, creating a cascade of proteolytic activity.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder that results in the synthesis of a non-functional enteropeptidase enzyme. Which of the following statements describes the most immediate and significant consequence for protein digestion in this patient's small intestine?\n\nA. All dietary proteins would pass through the small intestine completely undigested.\n\nB. The activation of chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, and proelastase would be severely impaired.\n\nC. The digestion of dietary lipids would be inhibited due to the lack of active proteases.\n\nD. The pH of the duodenal lumen would decrease significantly, denaturing all digestive enzymes.\n\nE. The pancreas would cease secretion of all zymogens in response to a feedback signal.", "solution": "- Key physiological mechanism: Pancreatic proteases are secreted as zymogens. Enteropeptidase on the duodenal brush border cleaves trypsinogen to form active trypsin. Trypsin then activates other pancreatic zymogens (e.g., chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, proelastase) in a cascade.\n- In a patient with non-functional enteropeptidase, the initiating step—conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin—is severely impaired. Without trypsin, downstream activation of other protease zymogens is also severely impaired because their main activator is trypsin.\n- Evaluating options:\n  - A is incorrect because gastric pepsin in the stomach begins protein digestion, and some brush border peptidases can act; thus, not all proteins pass undigested. The primary deficit is in pancreatic protease activation in the intestine.\n  - B is correct because the absence of trypsin formation prevents the trypsin-dependent activation of chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, and proelastase, causing a major block in pancreatic protein digestion.\n  - C is incorrect in this context because the question asks for the consequence for protein digestion; while colipase (for lipid digestion) is trypsin-activated, lipid digestion is not primarily governed by proteases, and this is not the most immediate or most significant consequence for protein digestion.\n  - D is incorrect because duodenal pH is regulated mainly by bicarbonate secretion and gastric acid load, not by enteropeptidase activity.\n  - E is incorrect because pancreatic zymogen secretion is regulated by hormonal (CCK, secretin) and neural signals; there is no cessation due to lack of enteropeptidase.\n- Therefore, the most immediate and significant consequence is severe impairment of activation of other pancreatic protease zymogens due to lack of trypsin activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2067457"}, {"introduction": "Biochemical concepts are confirmed and studied through laboratory techniques. Zymogen activation, which involves the physical cleavage of a peptide, results in a measurable change in molecular weight. This problem [@problem_id:2067458] bridges theory and practice by asking you to predict the results of an SDS-PAGE analysis, a fundamental tool for protein characterization, to visualize the outcome of proteolytic activation.", "problem": "A researcher is studying the activation of a newly discovered zymogen, Pro-hydrolase-G. This zymogen is a single polypeptide chain with a total molecular weight of 32.7 kDa. The activation of Pro-hydrolase-G into its active form, Hydrolase-G, is a multi-step process involving proteolytic cleavage by a specific protease. This process excises and removes two distinct internal peptide fragments, Fragment A and Fragment B. Fragment A has a molecular weight of 1.1 kDa, and Fragment B has a molecular weight of 2.4 kDa. The remaining polypeptide chains of the original zymogen constitute the mature, active Hydrolase-G, and they are held together as a single complex by multiple disulfide bonds.\n\nTo confirm the structure of the active enzyme, the researcher takes a purified sample of fully activated Hydrolase-G and analyzes it using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The experiment is conducted under standard denaturing conditions but, crucially, in the absence of any reducing agents such as $\\beta$-mercaptoethanol.\n\nCalculate the apparent molecular weight of the band that would be observed for the active Hydrolase-G on this SDS-PAGE gel.

Let the molecular weight of the zymogen be $M_{Z}$, and the molecular weights of the excised fragments be $M_{A}$ and $M_{B}$. The activation process removes these two internal fragments, so the total molecular weight of the remaining polypeptide chains that constitute the active enzyme is\n$$\nM_{H} = M_{Z} - \\left(M_{A} + M_{B}\\right).\n$$\nUnder SDS-PAGE performed in denaturing but nonreducing conditions, sodium dodecyl sulfate denatures the protein and confers a uniform charge-to-mass ratio, while the absence of reducing agents preserves disulfide bonds. Therefore, any polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds migrate as a single species with an apparent molecular weight equal to the sum of the masses of those chains. Since the two fragments $M_{A}$ and $M_{B}$ are excised and removed, the observed band corresponds to the mass $M_{H}$.\n\nSubstituting the given values $M_{Z} = 32.7 \\text{ kDa}$, $M_{A} = 1.1 \\text{ kDa}$, and $M_{B} = 2.4 \\text{ kDa}$,\n$$\nM_{H} = 32.7 \\text{ kDa} - \\left(1.1 \\text{ kDa} + 2.4 \\text{ kDa}\\right) = 32.7 \\text{ kDa} - 3.5 \\text{ kDa} = 29.2 \\text{ kDa}.\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures gives $29 \\text{ kDa}$ as the apparent molecular weight of the observed band.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{29}$$", "id": "2067458"}, {"introduction": "A key advantage of multi-step activation pathways, like those involving zymogens, is the capacity for immense signal amplification.

A classic example is a proteolytic cascade, where inactive enzyme precursors, called zymogens, are irreversibly activated by cleavage.\n\nConsider a hypothetical four-step proteolytic cascade involved in the terminal differentiation of a specialized cell type. The process is initiated by a trace amount of a signaling protease, which we will call Protease-I. Protease-I cleaves and activates Zymogen-A into Protease-A. In turn, Protease-A activates Zymogen-B into Protease-B, which then activates Zymogen-C into Protease-C, and finally, Protease-C activates Zymogen-D into the terminal effector, Protease-D.\n\nAssume that the initial concentration of the signaling Protease-I is exactly $1.00$ picomolar (pM). At each of the four activation steps (i.e., I to A, A to B, B to C, and C to D), the system exhibits a constant amplification factor, meaning that the molar concentration of the newly activated protease is exactly 150 times greater than the concentration of the protease that activated it.\n\nCalculate the final concentration of the active terminal effector, Protease-D.
