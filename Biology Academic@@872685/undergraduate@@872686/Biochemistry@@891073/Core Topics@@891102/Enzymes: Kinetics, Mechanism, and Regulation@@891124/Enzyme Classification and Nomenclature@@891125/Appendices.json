A common point of confusion arises in reactions involving water, but the Enzyme Commission (EC) system provides clear distinctions. This exercise [@problem_id:2043912] challenges you to differentiate between a hydrolase, which uses water to cleave a bond, and a lyase, which adds a group to a double bond—a fundamental skill for accurately categorizing enzymes.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating a key reaction within a metabolic pathway. The enzyme under study catalyzes the reversible stereospecific addition of a water molecule to the carbon-carbon double bond of (2*E*)-but-2-enedioate, yielding (2*S*)-2-hydroxybutanedioate as the product. To properly document this enzyme, it must be classified according to the primary classes established by the Enzyme Commission (EC). The six main EC classes are listed below for reference:\n\n*   **EC 1: Oxidoreductases:** Catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions.\n*   **EC 2: Transferases:** Transfer functional groups from one molecule to another.\n*   **EC 3: Hydrolases:** Catalyze the hydrolysis of chemical bonds (cleavage of a bond by the addition of water).\n*   **EC 4: Lyases:** Cleave C-C, C-O, C-N, and other bonds by elimination, leaving double bonds, or conversely add groups to double bonds.\n*   **EC 5: Isomerases:** Catalyze isomerization changes within a single molecule.\n*   **EC 6: Ligases:** Join two molecules with covalent bonds, coupled with the hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond in ATP or another nucleotide.\n\nBased on the reaction described, which of the following primary EC classes does this enzyme belong to?\n\nA.

This corresponds to the hydration of fumarate to L-malate (and its reverse, dehydration).\n\nAccording to the Enzyme Commission classification:\n- Hydrolases (EC 3) catalyze hydrolysis, which is cleavage of a single bond by addition of water; the hallmark is bond scission rather than addition across a double bond.\n- Lyases (EC 4) catalyze the addition of groups to double bonds or the elimination of groups to form double bonds. Hydratases, which add water across a double bond (or remove it to generate a double bond), are a subclass of lyases (specifically hydro-lyases, EC 4.2.1.x).\n\nSince the described reaction is an addition of water across a $C=C$ bond (and is reversible to an elimination), it matches the definition of a lyase rather than a hydrolase. Therefore, the enzyme belongs to EC 4 (Lyases).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2043912"}, {"introduction": "While some enzymes break molecules apart, others build them up in synthesis reactions. These processes often require an energy input to proceed, and recognizing this is key to their classification. This problem [@problem_id:2043905] introduces the Ligase class (EC 6), highlighting their signature feature: the coupling of bond formation to the hydrolysis of an energy-rich molecule like ATP. Mastering this concept allows you to identify enzymes that drive the construction of complex biomolecules.", "problem": "In the field of xenobiology, researchers have identified a novel metabolic pathway in a hypothetical extremophilic microorganism. A crucial enzyme in this pathway, which they have named \"Cyanoalanine Synthetase,\" catalyzes the synthesis of the non-proteinogenic amino acid $\\beta$-cyanoalanine from L-cysteine and a cyanide ion ($\\text{CN}^{-}$). The reaction involves the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the $\\beta$-carbon of the cysteine moiety and the carbon atom of the cyanide. This synthetic process is energetically unfavorable and is driven by the coupled hydrolysis of one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ($\\text{P}_\\text{i}$).\n\nAccording to the classification system established by the Enzyme Commission (EC), all enzymes are assigned a four-digit EC number.

Specifically, enzymes that form C–C bonds using nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis fall under EC 6.4.-.-.\n- EC 7: Translocases (movement of ions or molecules across membranes), not relevant here.\n\nThe presence of ATP hydrolysis to ADP and $\\text{P}_{\\text{i}}$ coupled to the formation of a new C–C bond identifies the enzyme as a ligase. Consistent nomenclature also supports this: enzymes termed “synthetases” are ligases (EC 6) that use nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to drive bond formation.\n\nTherefore, the first digit of the EC number for Cyanoalanine Synthetase is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2043905"}, {"introduction": "Enzyme classification is more than a cataloging system; it provides a framework of testable mechanistic hypotheses.
