At fixed pH, $[{\\mathrm{OH}}^{-}]$ is constant; thus $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ should be an affine linear function of $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]$ with a constant intercept.\n\nWe now test these predictions against the data.\n\nFirst, compare runs 1 and 2, both at pH equal to $5.00$. Under specific base catalysis, the prediction is\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1)=k_{\\mathrm{obs}}(2)=k_{\\mathrm{OH}}[{\\mathrm{OH}}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{pH}=5.00},\n$$\ni.e., $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ should be the same when pH is the same. Experimentally, run 1 gives $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}=6.45\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]=0.0635\\ \\mathrm{M}$, while run 2 gives $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}=1.28\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]=0.127\\ \\mathrm{M}$, essentially a doubling when $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]$ doubles. This contradicts the specific base prediction and is consistent with general base catalysis.\n\nUnder the general base model at fixed pH, write\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{obs}} = a[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}] + b,\n$$\nwith $a = k_{\\mathrm{Ac}}$ and $b = k_{\\mathrm{OH}}[{\\mathrm{OH}}^{-}] + k_{w}$ constant at fixed pH. Using runs 1 and 2 to determine $a$ and $b$,\n$$\na = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}(2) - k_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1)}{[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]_{2} - [\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]_{1}} = \\frac{1.28\\times 10^{-2} - 6.45\\times 10^{-3}}{0.127 - 0.0635} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1},\n$$\nand\n$$\nb = k_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1) - a[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]_{1} = 6.45\\times 10^{-3} - (0.10)(0.0635) = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nThus, at pH equal to $5.00$,\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx (0.10)[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}] + 1.0\\times 10^{-4}.\n$$\nThe small intercept shows that contributions from ${\\mathrm{OH}}^{-}$ or background are minor compared to the acetate term at these conditions.\n\nNext, test this linearity with runs 3 and 4 (total buffer fixed at $0.100\\ \\mathrm{M}$ but different pH and $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]$). Predict\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = (0.10)[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}] + 1.0\\times 10^{-4}.\n$$\nFor run 3, $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]=0.0500\\ \\mathrm{M}$ gives $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = 0.10\\times 0.0500 + 1.0\\times 10^{-4} = 5.10\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, matching the observed $5.06\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ within rounding. For run 4, $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]=0.0809\\ \\mathrm{M}$ gives $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = 0.10\\times 0.0809 + 1.0\\times 10^{-4} = 8.19\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, matching the observed $8.15\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ within rounding. These checks confirm that $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is proportional to $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]$ with a small, nearly constant intercept across the pH range studied, as expected for general base catalysis dominated by acetate. Because $[{\\mathrm{OH}}^{-}]$ at these pH values is extremely small compared to $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]$, the ${\\mathrm{OH}}^{-}$ contribution is negligible, not comparable.\n\nTherefore:\n- Specific base catalysis is ruled out because $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ changes at fixed pH when the buffer base concentration changes.\n- General base catalysis is strongly supported by the linear dependence $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ versus $[\\mathrm{AcO}^{-}]$ with nearly zero intercept.\n- The contributions are not approximately equal; the acetate term dominates.\n- The data are sufficient to distinguish mechanisms.\n- The reaction is clearly catalyzed by base in the buffer.\n\nHence the correct conclusion is general base catalysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487055"}, {"introduction": "Enzymes owe their incredible catalytic efficiency to the precise three-dimensional arrangement of functional groups within the active site. This exercise explores a hypothetical but highly realistic scenario where a seemingly conservative mutation—replacing one acidic residue with a slightly longer one—causes a dramatic loss of function. By analyzing this outcome, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the principle of stereo-electronic preorganization, which is fundamental to understanding enzyme power [@problem_id:2047184].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a novel enzyme, hydroxylase X, which utilizes a specific aspartate residue, Asp-95, as a general base in its catalytic mechanism. In the rate-limiting step, the carboxylate side chain of Asp-95 is perfectly positioned to abstract a proton from a specific hydroxyl group on the substrate, thereby activating it for a subsequent reaction. To probe the importance of this residue's positioning, the biochemist creates a mutant version of the enzyme where Asp-95 is replaced by a glutamate residue (Glu). This D95E mutant is found to have a catalytic rate that is over 1000-fold lower than the wild-type enzyme.\n\nAlthough both aspartate and glutamate possess a carboxylate group in their side chains and have very similar chemical properties, this single, conservative substitution has nearly abolished the enzyme's function.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical explanation for this dramatic loss of catalytic activity?\n\nA. The pKa of the glutamate side chain is significantly different from that of the aspartate side chain, rendering it an ineffective base at the pH of the enzyme's active site.\nB. The substitution of the smaller aspartate with the larger glutamate introduces a major steric clash with the substrate, preventing it from binding effectively in the active site.\nC. The additional methylene group in the glutamate side chain displaces the catalytic carboxylate group from the precise three-dimensional position required for efficient proton abstraction from the substrate.\nD. The D95E mutation disrupts critical hydrogen bonds far from the active site, leading to a global unfolding of the enzyme and a complete loss of its tertiary structure.\nE. The increased flexibility of the longer glutamate side chain allows it to adopt too many non-productive conformations, which entropically disfavors the formation of the transition state.", "solution": "We analyze the catalytic role of Asp-95 as a general base. In general-base catalysis, a properly positioned base abstracts a proton along a specific reaction coordinate from the substrate hydroxyl. Efficient proton transfer requires precise distance and angle alignment between the base’s carboxylate oxygen and the substrate proton. Enzyme active sites are preorganized to achieve this geometry, minimizing the reorganization energy and lowering the activation free energy.\n\nThe rate of the rate-limiting step follows transition state theory:\n$$\nk = \\kappa \\frac{k_{B}T}{h} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nso a catalytic rate reduction by a factor of $10^{3}$ corresponds to an increase in activation free energy\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = RT \\ln(10^{3}) = 3 RT \\ln(10),\n$$\nwhich can arise from even slight misalignment of the catalytic base with the substrate due to the steep dependence of hydrogen-bonding and proton transfer efficiency on distance and angle.\n\nConsider the D95E mutation. Glutamate is identical to aspartate except for one additional methylene group in the side chain. If the protein backbone and the packing of the active site remain essentially fixed, the positions of the carboxylate oxygens in Glu cannot coincide with those in Asp; the extra methylene displaces the reactive carboxylate group from the precise three-dimensional position that the enzyme evolved to present for optimal proton abstraction. This directly compromises the preorganized geometry critical for catalysis, increasing $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and thus decreasing $k$ exponentially, consistent with the observed $10^{3}$-fold rate loss.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A: The side-chain $pK_{a}$ values of aspartate and glutamate are similar in aqueous solution, and while active-site environments can shift $pK_{a}$ values, the difference intrinsic to Asp versus Glu is not large enough to be the fundamental cause of a $10^{3}$-fold rate loss. Moreover, the key role here is geometric preorganization rather than bulk acid-base strength; both residues can act as carboxylate bases if positioned correctly.\n\n- Option B: A “major steric clash preventing binding” is not the most accurate explanation for a conservative Asp-to-Glu substitution. Such a clash would primarily affect substrate binding ($K_{M}$) rather than specifically the catalytic step. The observation emphasizes loss of catalytic rate, pointing instead to mispositioning of the catalytic group rather than wholesale exclusion of the substrate.\n\n- Option C: The extra methylene in glutamate displaces the catalytic carboxylate from the exact reactive position. Because proton transfer efficiency is exquisitely sensitive to sub-angstrom positional and angular changes, this mispositioning raises $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and thus lowers $k$ by orders of magnitude, exactly matching the observed phenomenon. This is the most direct and fundamental structural explanation.\n\n- Option D: A global unfolding or complete loss of tertiary structure is inconsistent with a single conservative substitution and with the partial residual activity implied by a $10^{3}$-fold rate decrease. Such catastrophic effects would typically abolish activity entirely and be detectable by biophysical methods.\n\n- Option E: Increased side-chain flexibility could contribute to sampling non-productive conformations, but this is secondary to the primary effect: the equilibrium position of the carboxylate group is shifted by the added methylene. Enzymes overcome entropic costs by preorganization; the principal loss here is the precise geometric placement, not merely conformational entropy.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the added methylene in glutamate displaces the catalytic carboxylate from its required three-dimensional position for efficient proton abstraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2047184"}]}
