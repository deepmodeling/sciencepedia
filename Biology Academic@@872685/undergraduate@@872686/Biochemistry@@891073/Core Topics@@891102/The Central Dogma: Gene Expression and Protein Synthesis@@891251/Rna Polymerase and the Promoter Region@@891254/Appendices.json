By convention, the top strand is written 5' to 3' and is designated as the coding (or sense) strand.\n\n5'-ATGCGATTACGTTAGGCC-3'\n3'-TACGCTAATGCAATCCGG-5'\n\nDetermine the sequence of the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that would be transcribed from this DNA segment. Your answer should be the sequence of ribonucleotides written from the 5' end to the 3' end, without any spaces or labels.", "solution": "The process of creating a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule from a DNA template is called transcription. To solve this problem, we must apply the fundamental principles of transcription.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the template strand. The problem states that the top strand (5'-ATGCGATTACGTTAGGCC-3') is the coding strand. By definition, the other strand is the template (or antisense) strand, which is the one that RNA polymerase \"reads\" to synthesize the mRNA. Therefore, the template strand is 3'-TACGCTAATGCAATCCGG-5'.\n\nSecond, we must consider the directionality of transcription. The RNA polymerase enzyme moves along the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction. As it reads each DNA base on the template strand, it adds a complementary RNA nucleotide to the growing mRNA chain. The mRNA strand itself is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.\n\nThe base-pairing rules for transcription are as follows:\n- If the DNA template has Adenine (A), the mRNA will have Uracil (U).\n- If the DNA template has Thymine (T), the mRNA will have Adenine (A).\n- If the DNA template has Guanine (G), the mRNA will have Cytosine (C).\n- If the DNA template has Cytosine (C), the mRNA will have Guanine (G).\n\nLet's apply these rules by reading the template strand from its 3' end to its 5' end and building the mRNA from its 5' end to its 3' end.\n\nTemplate strand (read 3' to 5'): 3'- T A C G C T A A T G C A A T C C G G -5'\nSynthesized mRNA (built 5' to 3'): 5'- A U G C G A U U A C G U U A G G C C -3'\n\nA common and quicker method is to use the coding strand directly. The sequence of the mRNA transcript is identical to the sequence of the coding DNA strand, with the exception that Uracil (U) is used in place of Thymine (T).\n\nCoding strand: 5'-ATGCGATTACGTTAGGCC-3'\n\nWe replace every 'T' in the coding strand with a 'U':\n- The first 'T' at position 2 becomes 'U'.\n- The 'T' at position 7 becomes 'U'.\n- The 'T' at position 8 becomes 'U'.\n- The 'T' at position 12 becomes 'U'.\n- The 'T' at position 13 becomes 'U'.\n\nApplying this substitution to the entire coding strand gives:\n5'-AUGCGAUUACGUUAGGCC-3'\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The question asks for the sequence written from 5' to 3' without labels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AUGCGAUUACGUUAGGCC}$$", "id": "2073467"}, {"introduction": "Now that you can transcribe a given template, a critical question arises: how does RNA polymerase know where to start? This practice problem moves beyond simple mechanics to the level of regulation, introducing the role of promoter sequences as the essential \"start signals\" on the DNA. By learning to identify the conserved -10 and -35 boxes, you will be able to deduce which strand serves as the template and in which direction transcription proceeds, a key step in decoding a gene's instructions [@problem_id:2073524].", "problem": "In prokaryotic gene expression, transcription is initiated when the sigma factor subunit of the Ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase holoenzyme recognizes specific consensus sequences within a promoter region on the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). For many bacteria, such as *E. coli*, two critical consensus sequences are the -35 region (sequence: 5'-TTGACA-3') and the -10 region, also known as the Pribnow box (sequence: 5'-TATAAT-3'). The numbering refers to their approximate position upstream from the transcription start site (+1).

The enzyme reads the template strand in the $3' \\to 5'$ direction while synthesizing RNA in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction.\n- The RNA product has the same sequence as the coding strand (with U in place of T) and is complementary to the template strand.\n\nIdentification of promoter motifs:\n- The top strand is given $5'$-to-$3'$ as: 5'-CCGTTGACACGATTAGCTACGTACGATATAATGCTAGC-3'.\n- On this top strand, the -35 consensus sequence 5'-TTGACA-3' appears as \"TTGACA\" starting near the left (positions 4–9 when counting from the leftmost base).\n- On the same top strand, the -10 consensus sequence 5'-TATAAT-3' appears downstream as \"TATAAT\" (positions 27–32).\n- The order and orientation (5'-TTGACA ... TATAAT-3') on the same strand are consistent with a promoter on the top strand in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction.\n\nDeduction of template and reading direction:\n- Because promoter consensus sequences are defined on the coding strand, the presence of both motifs in correct orientation on the top strand means the top strand is the coding strand.\n- Therefore, the bottom strand is the template strand.\n- RNA polymerase reads the template strand in the $3' \\to 5'$ direction during transcription.\n\nConclusion: The template is the bottom strand, and RNA polymerase reads it $3' \\to 5'$, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2073524"}, {"introduction": "We know that promoter sequences are vital, but are all nucleotides within them equally important? This final exercise simulates a powerful molecular biology experiment—saturation mutagenesis—to explore the functional significance of sequence conservation. By predicting the outcomes of mutations in a highly conserved element versus a less conserved spacer region, you will develop a deeper appreciation for how sequence translates into function and why evolution maintains certain sequences with high fidelity [@problem_id:2073472].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the principles of gene regulation in *Escherichia coli*. The focus of the study is the promoter, a DNA sequence that directs the initiation of transcription. In *E. coli*, a typical promoter recognized by the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the $\\sigma^{70}$ (sigma-70) factor consists of two key conserved hexameric sequences: the -35 element (consensus sequence 5'-TTGACA-3') and the -10 element (consensus sequence 5'-TATAAT-3'). These two elements are separated by a \"spacer\" region, which optimally has a length of 17 base pairs, but its nucleotide sequence is generally less conserved.\n\nTo quantitatively assess the functional importance of different parts of the promoter, the biologist performs a comprehensive saturation mutagenesis experiment. This technique involves systematically creating a library of mutants where, for each position in a target region, the wild-type nucleotide is replaced by each of the other three possible nucleotides. The \"promoter activity\" of each resulting mutant is then measured, which reflects the rate of transcription initiation. The activity is normalized such that the original, unmutated wild-type promoter has an activity of 1.0, and a complete loss of function (no transcription) corresponds to an activity of 0.0.\n\nTwo separate saturation mutagenesis screens are performed:\n1.  **-35 Screen**: The entire 6-base-pair -35 element is subjected to saturation mutagenesis.\n2.  **Spacer Screen**: A 6-base-pair segment located in the middle of the 17-base-pair spacer region is subjected to saturation mutagenesis.\n\nAfter measuring the promoter activity for all generated mutants in both screens, frequency distributions are plotted. Based on the established roles of these promoter regions, which of the following statements best describes the expected distributions of promoter activities?\n\nA. -35 Screen: The distribution is heavily skewed, with a very large fraction of mutants showing activity close to 0.0. Spacer Screen: The distribution is centered around an activity of 1.0, with a significant fraction of mutants having near-wild-type activity.\n\nB. -35 Screen: The distribution is centered around an activity of 1.0, with most mutants having near-wild-type activity. Spacer Screen: The distribution is heavily skewed, with a very large fraction of mutants showing activity close to 0.0.\n\nC. Both Screens: The distributions are similar and centered around an activity of 1.0, indicating that most mutations in both regions are functionally neutral.\n\nD. Both Screens: The distributions are similar and heavily skewed towards an activity of 0.0, indicating that the entire promoter region is exquisitely sensitive to any mutation.\n\nE. -35 Screen: The distribution shows a wide, uniform spread of activities from 0.0 to 1.0. Spacer Screen: The distribution is bimodal, with sharp peaks at both 0.0 and 1.0.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the mechanistic roles of the promoter elements for the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the $\\sigma^{70}$ factor in Escherichia coli. The -35 element (consensus 5'-TTGACA-3') and the -10 element (consensus 5'-TATAAT-3') are sequence-specific recognition motifs that contribute directly to binding and isomerization of the holoenzyme. Strong sequence conservation in these hexamers reflects strong functional constraint; deviations from consensus typically reduce binding affinity and transcription initiation efficiency. In contrast, the spacer between them primarily contributes optimal geometry (distance and helical phasing) between -35 and -10; its optimal length is approximately 17 base pairs, but its nucleotide sequence is generally not strongly conserved, indicating weaker sequence-specific constraint.\n\nIn a saturation mutagenesis experiment of a 6-bp region, each of the 6 positions is mutated to the three non-wild-type nucleotides, producing a set of single-nucleotide variants. Let the activity of the wild-type promoter be defined as 1.0, and complete loss of activity as 0.0.\n\nFor the -35 screen: Because each base in the -35 hexamer participates in sequence-specific contacts necessary for recognition by $\\sigma^{70}$ and productive binding, most single-nucleotide substitutions within this hexamer are expected to reduce the promoter’s affinity for RNA polymerase and thus lower transcription initiation. Therefore, the distribution of measured activities should be heavily skewed toward lower values, with many mutants showing activities near 0.0 and relatively few near 1.0.\n\nFor the spacer screen: The spacer’s critical parameter is length, not sequence. A 6-bp segment in the middle of the 17-bp spacer, when altered by single-base substitutions that do not change the spacer length, is generally expected to have minor effects. While some substitutions can modestly affect DNA flexibility or helical phasing through sequence-dependent mechanics, the overall expectation is that many mutants will retain near-wild-type activity. Hence, the distribution should be centered near 1.0 with a significant fraction of near-wild-type activities, and not heavily skewed toward 0.0.\n\nComparing these expectations with the options, the -35 screen showing a heavy skew to low activity and the spacer screen centered around 1.0 corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2073472"}]}
