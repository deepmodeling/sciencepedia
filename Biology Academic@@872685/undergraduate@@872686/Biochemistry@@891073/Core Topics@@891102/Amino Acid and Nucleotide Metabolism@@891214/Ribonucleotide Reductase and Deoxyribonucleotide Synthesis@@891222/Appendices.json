[@problem_id:2072633]", "problem": "Ribonucleotide Reductase (RNR) is a critically important enzyme responsible for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, the monomeric precursors of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). It catalyzes the reduction of the 2'-hydroxyl group on ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) to form 2'-deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs). In many organisms, the Class I RNR enzyme functions as a heterodimer of two subunits, R1 and R2. The R2 subunit contains a di-iron center that generates and stabilizes a tyrosyl radical on a specific tyrosine residue. This radical is essential for initiating the catalytic cycle in the R1 subunit.\n\nImagine a genetically engineered strain of a bacterium that relies solely on a Class I RNR for its survival. In this strain, a site-directed mutation has been introduced into the gene encoding the R2 subunit, changing the codon for the essential radical-harboring tyrosine residue to a codon for phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that is structurally identical to tyrosine, except that it lacks the hydroxyl group on its aromatic ring.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary functional consequence of this Tyr-to-Phe mutation on deoxyribonucleotide synthesis in the engineered bacterium?\n\nA. The catalytic activity of RNR will be completely abolished, leading to a cessation of all deoxyribonucleotide synthesis.\n\nB.

The enzyme will lose its ability to reduce purine ribonucleotides (ADP, GDP) but will retain its ability to reduce pyrimidine ribonucleotides (CDP, UDP).\n\nE. The enzyme will function normally, as the aromatic ring of phenylalanine is sufficient to stabilize the necessary radical.", "solution": "The problem asks for the primary consequence of mutating a key tyrosine residue to phenylalanine in the R2 subunit of Class I Ribonucleotide Reductase (RNR). To determine the outcome, we must analyze the specific role of this tyrosine residue in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: The Role of the Tyrosyl Radical in Class I RNR**\nClass I RNRs initiate their catalytic activity through a radical mechanism. The R2 subunit's function is to generate a stable free radical. It does this using a di-iron(III) center which, through a reaction with molecular oxygen, performs a one-electron oxidation of a nearby and specific tyrosine residue. This creates a tyrosyl radical, which is a neutral phenoxy radical stabilized by the aromatic ring. This tyrosyl radical is absolutely essential as it is the ultimate source of the radical used in the R1 active site for catalysis.\n\n**Step 2: The Radical Transfer Pathway**\nThe tyrosyl radical in R2 is located far from the catalytic active site in the R1 subunit. The radical is transferred over a long distance (approximately 35 Å) through a specific pathway of amino acid residues to a cysteine residue in the R1 active site. This generates a reactive cysteine thiyl radical ($\\text{-S}^{\\bullet}$) in the heart of the enzyme.\n\n**Step 3: The Catalytic Mechanism**\nThe cysteine thiyl radical in the R1 subunit initiates the chemical reduction of the ribonucleotide substrate. It does this by abstracting the 3'-hydrogen atom from the ribose ring of the bound NDP. This is the first chemical step of substrate reduction. Without the generation of this thiyl radical, the entire catalytic process cannot begin.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Tyr-to-Phe Mutation**\nThe mutation replaces tyrosine with phenylalanine.\n- Tyrosine has a phenol side chain: a benzene ring with a hydroxyl (–OH) group.\n- Phenylalanine has a phenyl side chain: just a benzene ring.\nThe formation of the initial tyrosyl radical involves the oxidation of the hydroxyl group: $\\text{R-Ph-OH} \\rightarrow \\text{R-Ph-O}^{\\bullet} + \\text{H}^{+} + e^{-}$. The resulting phenoxy radical is relatively stable.\nPhenylalanine lacks this hydroxyl group. To form a radical on phenylalanine, one would have to break a much stronger C-H bond on the aromatic ring, which is not a reaction that the di-iron center in R2 is capable of performing under physiological conditions. Therefore, the mutant R2 subunit containing phenylalanine instead of tyrosine cannot generate the initial radical.\n\n**Step 5: Consequence of the Inability to Form the Radical**\nSince the initial tyrosyl radical cannot be formed in the mutant R2 subunit, the radical transfer pathway to the R1 subunit's active site cysteine cannot be initiated. No cysteine thiyl radical is generated. As the thiyl radical is required to start the substrate reduction, the enzyme is catalytically dead. It is completely inactive. This means that no ribonucleotides (ADP, GDP, CDP, UDP) can be converted to their deoxy- forms.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluating the Options**\nA. **The catalytic activity of RNR will be completely abolished, leading to a cessation of all deoxyribonucleotide synthesis.** This is the correct conclusion. The inability to form the initiating radical makes the enzyme completely non-functional.\nB. **The catalytic activity of RNR will be significantly reduced but not completely eliminated...** This is incorrect. The tyrosyl radical is not merely an enhancer of activity; it is an absolute requirement for the canonical mechanism. There are no known alternative pathways for Class I RNRs that would allow for residual activity in its absence.\nC. **The catalytic rate of RNR will be unaffected, but the enzyme will no longer be responsive to allosteric regulation...** This is incorrect. The mutation affects the core catalytic initiation step, not allosteric regulation. The allosteric sites are located on the R1 subunit and are distinct from the radical generation site in R2.\nD. **The enzyme will lose its ability to reduce purine ribonucleotides... but will retain its ability to reduce pyrimidine ribonucleotides...** This is incorrect. The radical mechanism is common to the reduction of all four NDP substrates. Substrate specificity is determined by the allosteric specificity site, but the fundamental chemistry initiated by the radical is the same for all substrates. If the radical is absent, no substrates can be reduced.\nE. **The enzyme will function normally, as the aromatic ring of phenylalanine is sufficient to stabilize the necessary radical.** This is incorrect. While the aromatic ring is important for stabilization, the radical is formed *from* the hydroxyl group. Phenylalanine lacks this group and cannot be oxidized in the same manner to form the required radical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2072633"}, {"introduction": "An enzyme's function is defined not only by its mechanism but also by how it meets the cell's dynamic needs.

The precursors dATP, dGTP, and dCTP are synthesized from the RNR products dADP, dGDP, and dCDP, respectively. The precursor for thymine, dTTP, is synthesized from dTMP, which is formed by the methylation of dUMP. A crucial detail from isotopic labeling experiments is that within this host-phage system, 75% of the dUMP required for thymidylate synthesis is derived from the cytidine pathway (originating from RNR's action on CDP), while the remaining 25% is derived from the uridine pathway (originating from RNR's action on UDP).\n\nAssuming the replication process proceeds to completion with no loss of intermediates, calculate the relative catalytic turnover required for ribonucleotide reductase on its four substrates.

It catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) to their corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs). The activity and substrate specificity of RNR are tightly regulated by allosteric effectors to maintain a balanced intracellular pool of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs): dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. This balance is crucial for high-fidelity DNA replication.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell line that harbors a specific mutation in the gene encoding the RNR enzyme. This mutation affects the allosteric specificity site, causing the enzyme to be \"locked\" in a conformation that gives it an overwhelmingly high preference for reducing Cytidine Diphosphate (CDP) to dCDP.

Therefore, the primary imbalance is high dCTP with low purine dNTPs.\n\nA general principle of replication fidelity is that imbalanced dNTP pools increase the probability that the overabundant nucleotide is misincorporated opposite a noncognate template base, and low levels of the correct nucleotide exacerbate this by reducing correct competition. The most relevant wobble/mismatch pairs are A:C and G:T.\n\nWith dCTP in excess and dATP scarce, DNA polymerase frequently misincorporates C opposite a template A, yielding an A:C mismatch.
