This exercise will guide you through this process for a common sugar, $\\alpha$-D-galactopyranose. The key is to first identify the most stable chair scaffold and then correctly place each substituent in either an axial or equatorial position based on its orientation in the Haworth projection [@problem_id:2034176]. Mastering this skill is fundamental, as the precise 3D arrangement of hydroxyl groups determines a sugar's biological role.", "problem": "Monosaccharides, such as D-galactose, exist predominantly in aqueous solution as cyclic hemiacetals called pyranoses. These six-membered rings are not planar and adopt puckered, low-energy chair conformations. For any given pyranose, two distinct chair conformations exist, which can interconvert through a process known as a ring flip. The relative stability of these two conformations is determined by the steric strain associated with the arrangement of the ring's substituents.\n\nConsider the specific anomer $\\alpha$-D-galactopyranose. Based on the principles of conformational analysis, one of its two chair conformations is significantly more stable than the other. Using the standard carbohydrate numbering convention where C1 denotes the anomeric carbon, which of the following options correctly identifies all the carbon atoms of the pyranose ring that are directly bonded to an axial hydroxyl (-OH) group in the most stable chair conformation of $\\alpha$-D-galactopyranose?\n\nA.

C3 and C4", "solution": "We analyze $\\alpha$-D-galactopyranose using standard stereochemical conventions.\n\nFirst, assign up/down orientations in the Haworth projection from the Fischer projection of D-galactose. For D-galactose, the C2 hydroxyl is on the right in the Fischer (down in Haworth), the C3 hydroxyl is on the left (up), the C4 hydroxyl is on the left (up), and the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ at C5 is up for a D-sugar. The $\\alpha$ anomer means the anomeric hydroxyl at C1 is down. Therefore, the up/down set for substituents is: C1 OH down, C2 OH down, C3 OH up, C4 OH up, C5 $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ up.\n\nNext, choose the more stable chair conformation. For D-pyranoses, the $^{4}C_{1}$ chair that keeps the bulky C5 $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ equatorial is generally more stable; the ring flip ($^{1}C_{4}$) would place the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group axial, increasing steric strain. In the $^{4}C_{1}$ chair, the mapping between up/down and axial/equatorial is: at C1, C3, C5, up is equatorial and down is axial; at C2 and C4, down is equatorial and up is axial. This mapping is consistent with $\\beta$-D-glucopyranose having all substituents equatorial in the $^{4}C_{1}$ chair.\n\nApply this mapping to $\\alpha$-D-galactopyranose in the $^{4}C_{1}$ chair:\n- C1 OH is down, so at C1 down is axial, hence axial.\n- C2 OH is down, so at C2 down is equatorial, hence equatorial.\n- C3 OH is up, so at C3 up is equatorial, hence equatorial.\n- C4 OH is up, so at C4 up is axial, hence axial.\n- C5 $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ is up, so at C5 up is equatorial, minimizing steric strain.\n\nTherefore, in the most stable chair conformation, the hydroxyl groups that are axial are precisely those at C1 and C4.

This practice challenges you to compare D-glucose and its C2 epimer, D-mannose, by evaluating a key source of steric strain: 1,3-diaxial interactions. By systematically identifying and counting these unfavorable interactions in the most stable chair of each sugar, you can develop a semi-quantitative feel for why even small stereochemical changes can have significant energetic consequences [@problem_id:2034124]. This type of analysis helps explain why $\\beta$-D-glucose, with all its non-hydrogen substituents in equatorial positions, is the most stable and widespread aldohexose in nature.", "problem": "In aqueous solutions, monosaccharides like D-glucose and D-mannose exist predominantly as cyclic six-membered rings called pyranoses. These rings are not planar and adopt low-energy chair conformations to minimize steric strain. The relative stability of different pyranose chairs is largely determined by steric hindrance from 1,3-diaxial interactions, which are repulsive interactions between axial substituents on the same face of the ring. For this problem, we define a significant 1,3-diaxial interaction as one that involves at least one hydroxyl (-OH) group interacting with another axial substituent (either -H or -OH) on a carbon atom two positions away (e.g., between C1 and C3, or C2 and C4).\n\nD-mannose is the C2 epimer of D-glucose, meaning they differ only in their stereochemistry at the C2 carbon. Considering only the most stable chair conformation for each sugar, determine the number of significant 1,3-diaxial interactions for $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranose and $\\alpha$-D-mannopyranose, respectively.\n\nA. 1 and 2\n\nB. 2 and 3\n\nC. 2 and 4\n\nD. 1 and 3\n\nE. 0 and 2", "solution": "We first identify the most stable chair conformations and the axial versus equatorial orientations of substituents.\n\nFor $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranose in its lowest-energy chair (the same chair that makes $\\beta$-D-glucopyranose all-equatorial), only the anomeric hydroxyl at C1 is axial; the hydroxyls at C2, C3, C4 and the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ at C5 are equatorial. Significant 1,3-diaxial interactions are defined as axial–axial interactions involving at least one hydroxyl, with the partner axial substituent located on a carbon two positions away on the same face (e.g., C1 with C3 and C5). The axial -OH at C1 therefore has two 1,3-diaxial interactions: with the axial H at C3 and with the axial H at C5 (both are on the same face because axial positions at C1, C3, and C5 are parallel). No other hydroxyl is axial, so the total for $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranose is 2.\n\nFor $\\alpha$-D-mannopyranose (the C2 epimer), in the same most stable chair the anomeric hydroxyl at C1 is axial and, due to the epimerization at C2, the hydroxyl at C2 is also axial; the hydroxyls at C3 and C4 and the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ at C5 remain equatorial. Count significant 1,3-diaxial interactions as follows:\n- The axial -OH at C1 contributes two interactions (with axial H at C3 and at C5), as above.\n- The axial -OH at C2 has a 1,3-diaxial partner only at C4 (axial H), because the other position two atoms away is the ring oxygen O5, which is not a carbon and thus does not qualify under the problem’s definition (“on a carbon atom two positions away”). Hence C2 contributes one interaction.\nSumming gives $2+1=3$ for $\\alpha$-D-mannopyranose.\n\nTherefore, the numbers of significant 1,3-diaxial interactions are 2 and 3, respectively, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2034124"}, {"introduction": "To move from a qualitative comparison to a quantitative prediction, we must apply the principles of chemical thermodynamics.
