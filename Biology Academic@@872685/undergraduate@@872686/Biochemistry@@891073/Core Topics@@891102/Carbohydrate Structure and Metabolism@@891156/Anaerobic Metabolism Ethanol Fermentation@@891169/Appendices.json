This practice employs isotopic labeling, a powerful technique in biochemical research, to follow a single carbon atom through the entire fermentation pathway.

A batch of yeast is cultured in a medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source. The glucose supplied has been isotopically labeled with Carbon-14 ($^{14}$C) at the carbon-1 position (C-1). The yeast is maintained under strictly anaerobic conditions, ensuring that it completely metabolizes the glucose into its final fermentation products: ethanol and carbon dioxide.\n\nAssuming the catabolism of glucose proceeds via the standard Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (glycolysis) followed by ethanol fermentation, determine the fate of the isotopic label.

After phosphorylation by phosphofructokinase, the label is at C-1 of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.\n\n2.  **Aldolase Cleavage**: The enzyme aldolase cleaves the six-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate between C-3 and C-4. This yields two three-carbon molecules: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which contains carbons 1, 2, and 3, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP), which contains carbons 4, 5, and 6. The $^{14}$C label, being at C-1, is now located at the C-1 position of DHAP.\n\n3.  **Triose Phosphate Isomerization**: The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase catalyzes the reversible conversion of DHAP to GAP. In this reaction, the carbon backbone is rearranged: C-1 of DHAP becomes C-3 of GAP, C-2 of DHAP becomes C-2 of GAP, and C-3 of DHAP becomes C-1 of GAP. Therefore, the $^{14}$C label that was on C-1 of DHAP is transferred to the C-3 position of GAP.\n\n4.  **Payoff Phase of Glycolysis**: The subsequent reactions of glycolysis convert GAP into pyruvate. During this conversion, the carbon skeleton is maintained. Thus, the C-3 of GAP becomes the C-3 of pyruvate, which is the methyl carbon ($\\text{CH}_3$-) group.\n\n5.  **Ethanol Fermentation**: The pyruvate molecule, with the $^{14}$C label on its methyl carbon (C-3), enters the fermentation pathway.\n    *   Pyruvate decarboxylase removes the carboxyl group (C-1) of pyruvate as carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$). The label at C-3 is unaffected.\n    *   The remaining two-carbon molecule, acetaldehyde, has the label on its methyl carbon.\n    *   Alcohol dehydrogenase reduces acetaldehyde to ethanol. The methyl carbon of acetaldehyde becomes the methyl carbon (C-2) of ethanol.\n\nConclusion: The isotopic label originally at C-1 of glucose ends up exclusively in the ethanol product, specifically on the methyl carbon (C-2 of ethanol, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$). None of the label appears in the carbon dioxide, which originates from C-1 of pyruvate (which in turn comes from C-3 or C-4 of the original glucose).

This problem challenges you to predict the metabolic consequences for a yeast cell that lacks a functional pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme. By thinking through this \"what if\" scenario, you can appreciate the critical, indispensable role of NAD$^{+}$ regeneration for the continuation of glycolysis and, consequently, for cell viability under anaerobic conditions [@problem_id:2031269].", "problem": "A biochemist develops a mutant strain of yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) that has a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme. This yeast strain is then cultured in a rich medium containing glucose as the sole carbon and energy source under strictly anaerobic conditions. Assuming the cell is initially viable and all other metabolic pathways are functional, what is the most immediate and critical metabolic consequence for this mutant yeast strain under these conditions?\n\nA. The rate of glycolysis will accelerate significantly to compensate for the inefficient ATP production.\n\nB. Pyruvate will accumulate, and the cell will switch to producing large amounts of lactic acid to regenerate NAD+.\n\nC. The intracellular ratio of NADH/NAD+ will increase dramatically, and net ATP production will cease.\n\nD. The cell will begin exporting pyruvate from the cell and importing ethanol from the medium to regenerate NAD+.\n\nE. The conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate will be immediately and completely inhibited by allosteric feedback, halting glycolysis at its first step.", "solution": "To determine the consequence of a non-functional pyruvate decarboxylase in yeast under anaerobic conditions, we must analyze the central pathway of anaerobic glucose metabolism, which is glycolysis followed by ethanol fermentation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the net reaction of glycolysis:\n$$ \\text{Glucose} + 2 \\, \\text{ADP} + 2 \\, P_i + 2 \\, \\text{NAD}^{+} \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{Pyruvate} + 2 \\, \\text{ATP} + 2 \\, \\text{NADH} + 2 \\, \\text{H}^{+} + 2 \\, \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\nUnder anaerobic conditions, glycolysis is the only pathway available for the yeast cell to generate ATP. A critical feature of this process is that it requires a constant supply of the oxidized coenzyme NAD⁺ to function. Specifically, the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes a key oxidation step that converts NAD⁺ to NADH.\n\nIn a normal, wild-type yeast cell under anaerobic conditions, the NAD⁺ pool is regenerated from NADH through the two-step process of ethanol fermentation:\n1.  **Decarboxylation of Pyruvate**: Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase.\n    $$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COCOO}^- + \\text{H}^{+} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Pyruvate decarboxylase}} \\text{CH}_3\\text{CHO} + \\text{CO}_2 $$\n2.  **Reduction of Acetaldehyde**: Acetaldehyde is then reduced to ethanol, a reaction that oxidizes NADH back to NAD⁺. This is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.\n    $$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{CHO} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^{+} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Alcohol dehydrogenase}} \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} + \\text{NAD}^{+} $$\n\nThe net effect of fermentation is the regeneration of NAD⁺, which allows glycolysis to continue producing ATP.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation in the mutant yeast strain with a non-functional pyruvate decarboxylase.\nStep 1 of the fermentation pathway is completely blocked. Pyruvate cannot be converted into acetaldehyde. Consequently, step 2 cannot occur because its substrate, acetaldehyde, is not being produced.\n\nThe critical consequence is that the cell has lost its primary mechanism for regenerating NAD⁺ from the NADH produced during glycolysis. As the cell attempts to perform glycolysis, it will consume the finite pool of available NAD⁺ and produce NADH. Without fermentation, the NADH will accumulate, and the NAD⁺ pool will be depleted. This leads to a dramatic increase in the intracellular NADH/NAD⁺ ratio.\n\nThe glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction in glycolysis is absolutely dependent on NAD⁺ as a co-substrate. Once the NAD⁺ is depleted, this enzymatic step will halt. Since this step is essential for the glycolytic pathway, the entire pathway will cease to function. When glycolysis stops, the net production of 2 ATP per glucose molecule also stops. As this is the only source of ATP for the cell under these anaerobic conditions, the cell will be unable to power its essential functions and will ultimately die.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n*   **A:** This is incorrect. Glycolysis cannot accelerate; it is completely dependent on NAD⁺, which is being depleted. The pathway will halt, not accelerate.\n*   **B:** This is a common misconception. While muscle cells undergo lactic acid fermentation, the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* does not possess a significant lactate dehydrogenase pathway to handle the full glycolytic flux. Its primary anaerobic fate for pyruvate is ethanol fermentation. Thus, it cannot simply switch to producing lactate to solve the NAD⁺ regeneration problem. Pyruvate will accumulate, but this doesn't resolve the cofactor imbalance.\n*   **C:** This is the correct answer. The inability to re-oxidize NADH causes it to accumulate (increasing the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio), which depletes the NAD⁺ required for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step of glycolysis. This halts glycolysis and, with it, all net ATP synthesis under anaerobic conditions.\n*   **D:** This is incorrect. Importing ethanol would not regenerate NAD⁺. The alcohol dehydrogenase reaction would have to run in reverse (ethanol to acetaldehyde) to produce NADH, further worsening the problem. Exporting pyruvate does not solve the NAD⁺ regeneration issue.\n*   **E:** This is incorrect. While allosteric regulation does occur in glycolysis, the immediate, rate-limiting failure is not at the first step (hexokinase) but at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step due to substrate (NAD⁺) depletion. This is a more direct and unavoidable consequence than feedback inhibition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2031269"}]}
