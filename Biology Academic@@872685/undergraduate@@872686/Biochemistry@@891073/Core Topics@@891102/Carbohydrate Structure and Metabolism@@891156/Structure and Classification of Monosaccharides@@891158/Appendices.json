In aqueous solution, the open-chain aldehyde form of D-mannose exists in equilibrium with its cyclic hemiacetal forms. The Fischer projection of the open-chain form of D-mannose features a six-carbon backbone with an aldehyde group at C-1 and a primary alcohol group at C-6. The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl groups on the chiral centers is as follows: C-2 is on the left, C-3 is on the left, C-4 is on the right, and C-5 is on the right.\n\nWhen D-mannose cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C-5 attacks the aldehyde carbon C-1, forming a six-membered ring known as a pyranose.
