[@problem_id:2071030]", "problem": "2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) is a glucose analog that differs from glucose by the absence of a hydroxyl group at the C2 position, which is replaced by a hydrogen atom. Like glucose, 2-DG is transported into cells and is a substrate for the enzyme hexokinase, which phosphorylates it to form 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2-DG-6P) in an ATP-dependent reaction. However, due to the missing C2 hydroxyl group, 2-DG-6P cannot be isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase. Consequently, 2-DG-6P becomes a \"dead-end\" product that cannot be further metabolized through the glycolytic pathway. Given this information, which of the following statements best describes the primary mechanism by which 2-DG acts as a potent inhibitor of glucose metabolism via glycolysis?\n\nA. 2-deoxyglucose acts as a competitive inhibitor, directly competing with glucose for the active site of hexokinase, thus reducing the rate of glucose phosphorylation.\n\nB. The product, 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate, accumulates in the cell and acts as a powerful allosteric inhibitor of hexokinase, preventing the phosphorylation of glucose.\n\nC. The accumulated 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate acts as an allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the primary rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.\n\nD. The continuous phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose depletes the cell's supply of ATP, which is required for the initial steps of glycolysis, thereby halting the pathway due to energy starvation.\n\nE. 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate directly binds to and inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in the payoff phase of glycolysis.", "solution": "We consider the enzymatic steps in glycolysis and how 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) perturbs them.\n\n1) Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose in the ATP-dependent reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Glucose} + \\text{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{hexokinase}} \\text{glucose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ADP}.\n$$\n2-DG is transported into cells similarly to glucose and is also a substrate for hexokinase:\n$$\n\\text{2-DG} + \\text{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{hexokinase}} \\text{2-DG-6P} + \\text{ADP}.\n$$\n\n2) Phosphoglucose isomerase normally catalyzes the reversible isomerization:\n$$\n\\text{glucose-6-phosphate} \\xrightleftharpoons[\\text{PGI}]{} \\text{fructose-6-phosphate}.\n$$\nHowever, due to the absence of the C2 hydroxyl group, $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ cannot be isomerized by phosphoglucose isomerase and thus becomes a metabolic dead-end.

This reduces the phosphorylation of both glucose and 2-DG, thereby diminishing flux into glycolysis at its entry step.\n\n4) Evaluate the options in light of these principles:\n- Option A states that 2-DG acts as a competitive inhibitor at hexokinase. While 2-DG competes with glucose for hexokinase binding, it is a bona fide substrate that is turned over to $\\text{2-DG-6P}$ rather than a simple competitive inhibitor that binds without catalysis.

[@problem_id:2071043]", "problem": "Glycolysis is a fundamental metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, yielding ATP and NADH in the process. The regulation of this pathway is critical for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. One of the key regulatory enzymes in glycolysis is pyruvate kinase (PK), which catalyzes the final, irreversible step: the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, coupled with the production of one molecule of ATP. In normal (wild-type) cells, pyruvate kinase is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP. This feedback inhibition mechanism slows down glycolysis when the cell has a high energy charge.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered cell line in which the gene encoding pyruvate kinase has a mutation.
