The molecule is known to possess a single reducing end. To determine its degree of branching, the biochemist performs an exhaustive methylation reaction on the amylopectin sample, followed by a complete acid hydrolysis to break all glycosidic bonds. This process yields a mixture of methylated glucose monomers.\n\nThe analysis of the hydrolysate identifies three main types of methylated derivatives:\n1.  2,3,6-tri-O-methylglucose, derived from the internal glucose residues in the linear chains.\n2.  2,3-di-O-methylglucose, derived from the glucose residues at the branch points.\n3.  2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylglucose, derived from the glucose residues at the non-reducing ends.\n\nThe quantitative analysis of the mixture reveals a specific molar ratio between two of these products: for every 9 molecules of 2,3-di-O-methylglucose detected, 10 molecules of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylglucose are found. Based on this experimental result, determine the total number of non-reducing ends in this amylopectin molecule.", "solution": "Exhaustive methylation protects all free hydroxyls by converting them to methoxy groups; positions involved in glycosidic bonds remain unmethylated. Subsequent complete acid hydrolysis cleaves all glycosidic bonds to yield monomeric methylated sugars whose methylation patterns identify the original bonding pattern of each residue:\n- 2,3,6-tri-O-methylglucose arises from internal linear residues (positions 1 and 4 glycosidically linked; 2,3,6 methylated).\n- 2,3-di-O-methylglucose arises from branch-point residues (positions 1,4,6 glycosidically linked; 2,3 methylated).\n- 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylglucose arises from non-reducing ends (position 1 glycosidically linked; 2,3,4,6 methylated).\n\nLet $B$ be the number of branch-point residues and $N$ be the number of non-reducing ends.

Each branch point corresponds to a residue with two outgoing linkages (via O-4 and O-6), while non-reducing ends are leaves with no outgoing linkages. For such a rooted tree in which the root has outdegree $1$ (the usual case for amylopectin), the number of leaves equals the number of branch points plus one. This can be shown combinatorially by counting edges. Let $L$ denote the number of leaves (here $L=N$), let $I_{1}$ be the number of internal nodes with outdegree $1$, and let $I_{2}$ be the number of internal nodes with outdegree $2$ (here $I_{2}=B$). In any finite tree, the number of edges $E$ satisfies $E=V-1$, where $V=L+I_{1}+I_{2}$ is the total number of nodes.

This conceptual exercise challenges your understanding of the precise roles of enzymes in glycogenolysis. By considering a hypothetical scenario involving only the glycogen debranching enzyme, you will explore the critical importance of substrate specificity and the sequential nature of metabolic pathways. [@problem_id:2063132]", "problem": "A biochemist is studying the enzymatic pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. A single, perfectly formed, mature glycogen particle is isolated and placed into a buffered aqueous solution. This particle is a large, branched polymer of glucose, and for the purposes of this model, you can assume all of its outer branches consist of more than four glucose residues. To this solution, a purified and concentrated preparation of glycogen debranching enzyme is added. The debranching enzyme is known to be bifunctional, possessing two distinct catalytic activities: an $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow4)$ glucanotransferase activity and an $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow6)$ glucosidase activity.

A large quantity of glucose-1-phosphate molecules.\n\nD. A single, intact glycogen particle, structurally unchanged from the initial reactant.\n\nE. A single \"limit dextrin\" molecule, where each of the original branches has been shortened to exactly four glucose residues.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires a precise understanding of the substrate specificity of the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism, specifically the glycogen debranching enzyme.\n\nFirst, let's review the normal process of glycogenolysis. The breakdown of glycogen is primarily initiated by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. This enzyme catalyzes the sequential phosphorolysis of glucose units from the non-reducing ends of the glycogen branches, breaking $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow4)$ glycosidic bonds and releasing glucose-1-phosphate. However, glycogen phosphorylase cannot act indefinitely; it stops its activity when it reaches a point four glucose residues away from an $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow6)$ branch point. The resulting structure, with its shortened branches, is known as a \"limit dextrin\".\n\nAt this stage, the glycogen debranching enzyme takes over. Its function is to remodel the limit dextrin so that glycogen phosphorylase can continue its action. The debranching enzyme has two activities that act sequentially:\n1.  **$\\alpha(1\\rightarrow4)$ glucanotransferase activity**: This activity recognizes the four-residue stubs on the limit dextrin. It cleaves the outer three glucose residues as a single block and transfers them to the non-reducing end of another branch, forming a new $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow4)$ bond.\n2.  **$\\alpha(1\\rightarrow6)$ glucosidase activity**: After the transferase activity, a single glucose residue remains attached to the main chain via an $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow6)$ glycosidic bond. The glucosidase activity specifically hydrolyzes this bond, releasing the single glucose unit as free (unphosphorylated) glucose.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific scenario described in the problem. We start with a complete, mature glycogen particle, not a limit dextrin. The problem explicitly states that all branches are longer than four residues. Furthermore, the only enzyme present is the glycogen debranching enzyme; glycogen phosphorylase is absent.\n\nWe must evaluate whether the glycogen debranching enzyme can act on this substrate.\n- The **transferase activity** requires a short, four-residue branch as its substrate. Since the problem specifies that all branches on the mature glycogen particle are longer than four residues, the specific structural feature required by the transferase is not present. Therefore, the transferase activity of the debranching enzyme is inactive.\n- The **$\\alpha(1\\rightarrow6)$ glucosidase activity** requires a single glucose residue linked by an $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow6)$ bond as its substrate. This substrate is only generated *after* the transferase has acted on a four-residue stub. Since the transferase cannot act in this scenario, the substrate for the glucosidase is never formed. The enzyme cannot cleave an $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow6)$ bond that has a long polysaccharide chain attached to it.\n\nSince the initial molecule (the mature glycogen particle) does not match the specific substrate requirements for either of the debranching enzyme's activities, no enzymatic reaction can occur. The enzyme and the substrate will be present in the solution, but no transformation of the glycogen will take place. Therefore, the final product is simply the initial reactant.\n\nLet's analyze the given options based on this conclusion:\nA. This is incorrect. The release of free glucose requires the glucosidase activity, which is not initiated. Debranching into a linear polymer is not the function of this enzyme alone.\nB. This is incorrect. It would require the cleavage of bonds within the glycogen structure, which cannot happen under these conditions.\nC. This is incorrect. Glucose-1-phosphate is the product of glycogen phosphorylase, which is explicitly stated to be absent.\nD. This is correct. As the enzyme has no substrate to act upon, the glycogen particle remains structurally unchanged.\nE. This is incorrect. A limit dextrin is the product of the action of glycogen phosphorylase on glycogen. Since phosphorylase is not present, a limit dextrin cannot be formed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2063132"}, {"introduction": "Cells must carefully manage their energy budgets, and even the seemingly simple act of storing fuel has a metabolic cost. This problem focuses on the energetic accounting of the glycogen cycle, from synthesis to breakdown. By tracking the consumption of high-energy phosphate bonds, you will calculate the net ATP expenditure required to store and retrieve a single glucose unit, revealing a fundamental principle of metabolic economy. [@problem_id:2063143]", "problem": "In cellular metabolism, glycogen serves as a primary short-term storage for glucose. The processes of adding glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) and removing it (glycogenolysis) are tightly regulated and have distinct energetic requirements.\n\nConsider a single molecule of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) in a liver cell. This molecule undergoes a full metabolic cycle: it is first incorporated into a large, pre-existing glycogen molecule, and then, at a later time, it is cleaved from the glycogen chain and converted back into glucose-6-phosphate.\n\nThe key transformations in this cycle are as follows:\n- **Incorporation into Glycogen**: The initial glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is first isomerized to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). This G1P is then activated by reacting with Uridine Triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The UDP-glucose molecule then adds its glucose unit to the growing glycogen chain, releasing Uridine Diphosphate (UDP). For the cell's energetic balance, the released UDP is subsequently rephosphorylated to UTP by an ATP-dependent kinase, and the PPi produced is rapidly hydrolyzed into two separate inorganic phosphate (Pi) molecules.\n- **Release from Glycogen**: Cleavage of the glucose unit from the glycogen chain is accomplished by a phosphorolysis reaction, which uses an inorganic phosphate molecule (Pi) to produce one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). This G1P is then isomerized back to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), completing the cycle.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the net number of high-energy phosphate bonds that are cleaved to complete this entire cycle for one molecule of glucose-6-phosphate.\n\nFor the purpose of this calculation, you must adhere to the following energetic accounting rules:\n- The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi, or UTP to UDP and Pi, counts as the cleavage of **one** high-energy phosphate bond.\n- The hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) to two molecules of inorganic phosphate (2 Pi) also counts as the cleavage of **one** high-energy phosphate bond.\n\nYour answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "We follow the molecule of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) through the described cycle and tally only the cleavages of high-energy phosphate bonds according to the stated accounting rules.\n\n1) Isomerization for incorporation:\nG6P isomerizes to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) via phosphoglucomutase:\nG6P ⇌ G1P.\nThis is an isomerization; no high-energy phosphate bond is cleaved. Count: $0$.\n\n2) Activation to UDP-glucose:\nG1P reacts with UTP to form UDP-glucose and PPi:\nG1P + UTP → UDP-glucose + PPi.\nThis step cleaves a phosphoanhydride bond in UTP by phosphoryl transfer to G1P, but it is not a hydrolysis to Pi. Per the problem’s explicit accounting rules, we do not count this step directly as “UTP to UDP and Pi” hydrolysis. Instead, the energetic cost is captured by the mandated ATP-dependent rephosphorylation of UDP in step 4. Count here: $0$ by the stated rules.\n\n3) Transfer to glycogen:\nUDP-glucose donates its glucose to glycogen, releasing UDP:\nUDP-glucose + glycogen_{n} → glycogen_{n+1} + UDP.\nNo high-energy phosphate bond is hydrolyzed. Count: $0$.\n\n4) Rephosphorylation of UDP to UTP:\nUDP is regenerated to UTP by an ATP-dependent kinase:\nATP + UDP → ADP + UTP.\nThis step involves cleavage of one phosphoanhydride bond of ATP (energetically equivalent to ATP → ADP + Pi). By the accounting rule “hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi counts as one high-energy phosphate bond,” we count this as one cleavage. Count: $1$.\n\n5) Hydrolysis of pyrophosphate:\nThe PPi produced in step 2 is hydrolyzed rapidly:\nPPi → 2 Pi.\nBy the stated rule, this hydrolysis counts as the cleavage of one high-energy phosphate bond. Count: $1$.\n\n6) Release from glycogen and return to G6P:\nGlycogen phosphorylase cleaves a glucose from glycogen using Pi to form G1P:\nglycogen_{n+1} + Pi → glycogen_{n} + G1P.\nNo ATP, UTP, or PPi hydrolysis occurs; this is a phosphorolysis. Count: $0$.\nG1P is isomerized back to G6P:\nG1P ⇌ G6P.\nIsomerization; no high-energy phosphate bond is cleaved. Count: $0$.\n\nSumming all counted cleavages across the entire cycle gives:\nTotal high-energy phosphate bonds cleaved $= 1$ (ATP-dependent rephosphorylation) $+ 1$ (PPi hydrolysis) $= 2$.\n\nTherefore, the net number of high-energy phosphate bonds cleaved to complete the entire cycle for one molecule of G6P is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2063143"}]}
