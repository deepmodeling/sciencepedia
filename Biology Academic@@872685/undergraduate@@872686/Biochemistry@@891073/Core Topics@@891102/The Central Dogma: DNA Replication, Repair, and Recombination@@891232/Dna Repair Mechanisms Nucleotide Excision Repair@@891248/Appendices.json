By organizing the sequence of events from damage recognition to final synthesis, you will build a foundational framework for how cells tackle bulky lesions in their DNA [@problem_id:2041662].", "problem": "Exposure of human skin cells to ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause the formation of pyrimidine dimers, such as thymine dimers, which are bulky lesions that distort the DNA double helix. In humans, these lesions are primarily repaired by a mechanism known as Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER). When such a lesion occurs in a region of the genome that is not actively being transcribed, the Global Genome Repair (GGR) sub-pathway of NER is initiated.\n\nConsider the repair of a single thymine dimer in a quiescent human fibroblast. A series of protein complexes act in a specific sequence to recognize the damage, excise the damaged segment, and synthesize a new, correct strand of DNA. The key protein players involved include: the XPC complex (Xeroderma Pigmentosum Complementation group C), TFIIH (Transcription Factor II H, which contains helicases XPB and XPD), the endonucleases XPG and XPF (in a complex with ERCC1), and a DNA Polymerase.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the chronological order of the major events in this GGR process?\n\nA. TFIIH unwinds the DNA, followed by damage recognition by the XPC complex, then incision by XPG/XPF, and finally synthesis by DNA Polymerase.\n\nB. The XPC complex recognizes the DNA distortion, TFIIH is recruited to unwind the DNA, incisions are made by XPG/XPF, and then DNA Polymerase fills the resulting gap.\n\nC. The XPC complex recognizes the DNA distortion, incisions are made by XPG/XPF, the DNA is then unwound by TFIIH, and finally DNA Polymerase fills the gap.\n\nD. Incision by XPG/XPF occurs first to create a nick, DNA Polymerase synthesizes a new strand, TFIIH unwinds the DNA, and the XPC complex removes the damaged segment.\n\nE. A DNA Glycosylase first removes the damaged thymine bases, followed by unwinding by TFIIH, incision by an AP endonuclease, and synthesis by DNA Polymerase.", "solution": "In global genome nucleotide excision repair of a UV-induced thymine dimer in human cells, damage recognition precedes DNA unwinding, which precedes dual incision, which precedes gap-filling synthesis and ligation. Specifically, in GGR the initial recognition is carried out by the XPC complex (with RAD23B and CETN2; DDB2 can facilitate recognition particularly for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers), which detects the helix-distorting lesion. Upon recognition, XPC recruits TFIIH. The helicase activities within TFIIH (XPB as a DNA translocase and XPD as a 5' to 3' helicase) unwind the DNA around the lesion to form an open bubble and verify the presence of damage, aided by XPA and RPA for damage verification and stabilization of the repair bubble. After the open complex is formed and the lesion is verified, dual incisions are executed: one incision on the 5' side by XPF-ERCC1 and one on the 3' side by XPG. The damaged oligonucleotide (approximately 24 to 32 nucleotides) is excised. The resulting gap is then filled by a DNA polymerase (typically polymerase $\\delta$, $\\epsilon$, or $\\kappa$, with PCNA and RFC) using the undamaged strand as template, and finally sealed by DNA ligase.\n\nEvaluating the options against this canonical sequence:\n- Option A is incorrect because it places TFIIH-mediated unwinding before damage recognition by XPC; XPC-mediated recognition is the initiating step in GGR.\n- Option B correctly lists the sequence: XPC recognition, TFIIH recruitment and unwinding, dual incisions by XPG/XPF-ERCC1, and gap filling by DNA polymerase.\n- Option C is incorrect because it places incisions before unwinding and verification; incision requires the preformed open complex.\n- Option D is incorrect because incision cannot occur before recognition and unwinding, and polymerase activity cannot precede excision.\n- Option E is incorrect because it describes base excision repair (glycosylase and AP endonuclease) rather than nucleotide excision repair.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2041662"}, {"introduction": "A true understanding of a biological pathway involves not only knowing what it does but also recognizing its limitations. Some forms of DNA damage are too complex for a single pathway to resolve. This problem explores such a scenario, focusing on a highly toxic lesion called an interstrand cross-link (ICL), and asks you to deduce the fundamental biochemical reason why the NER pathway alone is insufficient for the job [@problem_id:2041684]. This challenges you to think critically about the mechanistic requirements of repair synthesis.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a culture of human cells is exposed to a chemical agent known to cause Interstrand Cross-links (ICLs), which are covalent bonds formed between bases on opposite strands of the DNA double helix. This type of damage is highly cytotoxic as it blocks both DNA replication and transcription. A student proposes that the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for correcting bulky, helix-distorting lesions like pyrimidine dimers, should be able to resolve the ICLs. However, it is well-established that the NER pathway, operating by itself, is insufficient to repair an ICL.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason for the inability of the NER pathway alone to resolve an Interstrand Cross-link?\n\nA. The damage recognition proteins of the NER pathway are unable to detect the structural distortion caused by an ICL.\n\nB. The helicase enzymes within the NER complex (part of TFIIH) are physically unable to unwind the DNA at the site of the covalent cross-link.\n\nC. The final step of NER, catalysis by DNA ligase, is sterically inhibited by the remnant of the cross-link structure.\n\nD. NER functions by excising the damaged segment from one strand and using the opposite, undamaged strand as a template for resynthesis by DNA polymerase; an ICL compromises this template strand at the site of the lesion.\n\nE. The endonuclease enzymes of the NER pathway can only create incisions on one strand at a time, making it impossible to address a two-strand lesion.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the core biochemical mechanism of nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER recognizes bulky, helix-distorting lesions, introduces dual incisions on one DNA strand flanking the lesion, removes the resulting oligonucleotide, and then fills the single-stranded gap by DNA polymerase using the opposite, undamaged strand as the template, followed by ligation to restore phosphodiester continuity. Thus, a defining requirement of NER is the presence of an intact complementary strand to guide accurate resynthesis.\n\nAn interstrand cross-link (ICL) is a covalent bond between bases on opposite strands. This means that both strands are chemically compromised at the lesion site and cannot be separated normally. Critically, because the lesion involves both strands, there is no fully undamaged complementary template available across the cross-linked position for polymerase-mediated gap filling after excision from one strand. Therefore, the fundamental limitation of NER acting alone on an ICL is not primarily lesion recognition or incision chemistry per se, but the lack of an intact template strand needed for faithful repair synthesis.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because ICLs do cause severe helical distortion and can be recognized; NER can be recruited to ICLs as part of multi-pathway repair.\n- B describes a physical obstacle (helicase unwinding) that can occur, but it is not the fundamental biochemical reason NER alone fails; even if partial processing occurs, the core barrier is the absence of a usable template.\n- C is incorrect because the ligation step is not the primary bottleneck; the essential problem arises before ligation, at the synthesis step requiring a template.\n- D captures the central mechanistic limitation: NER depends on the opposite strand as a template, and an ICL damages both strands at the same site, compromising that template function.\n- E is incorrect because the single-strand incision capability of NER is not, by itself, what makes ICL repair impossible; specialized ICL repair pathways perform unhooking and then rely on translesion synthesis and homologous recombination to overcome the templating problem.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason is that NER’s template-dependent resynthesis step is untenable at an ICL, making option D correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2041684"}, {"introduction": "The power of genetics lies in connecting a molecular defect (genotype) to an observable characteristic (phenotype).

This final practice exercise puts you in the role of an experimentalist, tasking you with designing a genetic screen using the classic replica plating technique to isolate UV-sensitive mutants [@problem_id:2041706]. This will solidify your understanding of the real-world biological consequences of a faulty NER system.", "problem": "A researcher is attempting to isolate *E. coli* mutants that have a defective Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) system. The NER system is a primary defense mechanism against DNA damage caused by Ultraviolet (UV) light, which induces the formation of bulky lesions like pyrimidine dimers. A deficiency in NER makes the cell hypersensitive to UV radiation. The researcher starts with a culture of wild-type *E. coli*, exposes it to a chemical mutagen to induce random mutations throughout the genome, and then plates the bacteria on a nutrient-rich agar medium to allow individual colonies to form. Each colony originates from a single bacterium and can be either wild-type for NER or a mutant.\n\nTo identify the desired UV-sensitive mutants, the researcher plans to use the replica plating technique. This technique involves transferring cells from the initial \"master\" plate of colonies onto one or more new \"replica\" plates using a sterile velvet surface, preserving the spatial arrangement of the colonies.\n\nWhich of the following experimental procedures correctly describes the method and expected outcome for identifying a colony of *E. coli* with a defective NER system?\n\nA. Create two replica plates from the master plate. One replica plate is a control and receives no treatment. The other replica plate is exposed to a dose of UV light. The desired mutant colonies are those that grow on the control plate but are absent from the UV-exposed plate.\n\nB.

Create two replica plates from the master plate. One replica plate is a control and receives no treatment. The other replica plate is exposed to a dose of UV light. The desired mutant colonies are those that grow on the UV-exposed plate but are absent from the control plate.\n\nD. Create two replica plates from the master plate. One replica plate is a control containing rich nutrient medium. The other replica plate contains a minimal medium lacking a specific amino acid. The desired mutant colonies are those that grow on the control plate but are absent from the minimal medium plate.\n\nE. Create two replica plates from the master plate and expose both of them to a dose of UV light. The desired mutant colonies are those that fail to grow on either plate.", "solution": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the principal pathway in bacteria for removing bulky DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. Cells defective in NER are hypersensitive to UV exposure because they cannot efficiently repair these lesions, leading to loss of viability after UV treatment.\n\nReplica plating transfers cells from a master plate onto new plates while preserving colony positions. This allows screening under selective conditions without disturbing the original master plate, so that colonies failing under selection can still be recovered from the master plate based on their positions.\n\nTo identify UV-sensitive (NER-defective) mutants, the appropriate design is to generate at least two replica plates from the same master: one untreated control to show which colonies are viable under non-stress conditions, and one exposed to UV to reveal hypersensitivity. The expected outcome is that NER-defective colonies will grow on the control replica (indicating they are viable) but will be absent from the UV-exposed replica (indicating hypersensitivity to UV). Their positions on the replicas allow the corresponding colonies to be located and recovered from the original master plate.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A correctly describes making two replicas, treating one with UV, and identifying mutants as those present on the control but absent after UV. This matches the expected phenotype of NER-defective mutants and preserves the master plate for recovery.\n- Option B inappropriately irradiates the master plate, which would kill UV-sensitive mutants before they can be replicated and would instead enrich for UV-resistant colonies.\n- Option C reverses the expected outcome; UV-sensitive strains will not selectively grow after UV treatment.\n- Option D tests for auxotrophy using minimal medium and is unrelated to DNA repair/UV sensitivity.\n- Option E lacks an untreated control, preventing discrimination between general growth failure and UV hypersensitivity, and does not preserve a reference condition for identifying viable colonies.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure and expected outcome are described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2041706"}]}
