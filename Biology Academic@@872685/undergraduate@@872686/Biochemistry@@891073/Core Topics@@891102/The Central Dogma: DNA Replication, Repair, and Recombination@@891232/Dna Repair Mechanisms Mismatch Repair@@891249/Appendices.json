This foundational exercise models the fate of a single replication error in a bacterial cell lacking the key recognition protein, MutS.

A single cell from this mutant strain is isolated. At a specific locus on its chromosome, it possesses a standard Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) base pair.\n\nDuring the first round of DNA replication, a biosynthetic error occurs: on the strand where Guanine (G) serves as the template, DNA polymerase erroneously incorporates a Thymine (T) into the newly synthesized strand, creating a G-T mismatch. Assume that no other repair mechanism (such as base excision repair) corrects this specific mismatch before the next replication event.\n\nThis single cell and its subsequent progeny are allowed to undergo two full cycles of replication and cell division, resulting in a total of four granddaughter cells.

Replicating the G-containing strand yields incorporation of C opposite G, producing a G-C duplex. Replicating the T-containing strand yields incorporation of A opposite T, producing an A-T duplex. Hence, this mismatched duplex gives rise to one A-T and one G-C.\n- The correct G-C duplex replicates to two G-C duplexes.\n\nCollecting outcomes after two full cycles (four granddaughter genomes): one A-T and three G-C, so the fraction with a permanent A-T is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nAmong the provided options, this corresponds to B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2041390"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the consequences of an absent MMR system, we now explore a more subtle and profound defect. This thought experiment considers a scenario where the repair machinery is active but makes a crucial error: it mistakes the original template strand for the newly synthesized, erroneous one. This exercise illuminates the absolute necessity of accurate strand discrimination and reveals the striking principle that a malfunctioning repair system can be even more detrimental than no repair at all, as it actively solidifies mutations into the genome. [@problem_id:2041403]", "problem": "In prokaryotes such as *E. coli*, the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system plays a crucial role in maintaining genome fidelity by correcting errors made during DNA replication. This system distinguishes the newly synthesized daughter strand from the older parental template strand through a mechanism involving DNA methylation. The *dam* methylase enzyme methylates adenine residues within GATC sequences. For a short period following replication, the new strand remains unmethylated while the template strand is already methylated. The MMR machinery uses this methylation signal to identify and correct the base on the unmethylated new strand.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant strain of *E. coli* in which the MMR system is altered. While it can still perfectly recognize base-pair mismatches, it has a critical defect: it now incorrectly identifies the methylated parental strand as the strand to be \"corrected\" and uses the erroneous, newly synthesized strand as the template for the repair.\n\nWhat is the most significant and direct consequence of this specific defect for the cell?\n\nA. The cell would enter a state of permanent cell cycle arrest because the repair system would be locked in a futile cycle of creating and trying to repair mismatches.\n\nB. The mismatch repair system would become completely inactive, resulting in a mutation rate identical to that of a cell completely lacking the mismatch repair machinery.\n\nC. The original mutation on the newly synthesized strand would be corrected, but the template strand would be needlessly nicked and repaired, wasting cellular energy in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nD. The mutation rate would become significantly higher than in a cell merely lacking mismatch repair, as replication errors would be actively and permanently incorporated into the parental DNA template.\n\nE. The cell would be unable to replicate its DNA, as the modified repair system would stall the replication fork at the site of any mismatch.", "solution": "Normal MMR in prokaryotes: after replication, the daughter strand is transiently unmethylated at GATC sites, whereas the parental strand is methylated. The MMR machinery recognizes a mismatch, identifies the unmethylated (daughter) strand as the erroneous strand, introduces a nick, removes a stretch encompassing the mismatch, and resynthesizes using the methylated parental strand as the template. This restores the correct base pairing and prevents fixation of replication errors.\n\nDefine $p$ as the per-site probability that DNA polymerase introduces a base-pair mismatch during replication. Consider the fate of such a mismatch under different scenarios:\n\n- No MMR present: the mismatch persists to the next round of replication. Each strand templates a daughter: one daughter molecule will carry the mutant base pair (fixing the mutation), and the other will carry the original correct base pair. Thus, the probability that a given mismatch becomes a fixed mutation is $P_{\\text{fix}|\\text{noMMR}}=\\frac{1}{2}$, and the per-site mutation rate contributed by replication errors is $r_{\\text{noMMR}} = p \\times \\frac{1}{2}$ (neglecting other pathways).\n\n- Inverted-strand-choice MMR (the mutant described): the system perfectly recognizes mismatches but erroneously selects the methylated parental strand as the one to excise, and uses the unmethylated daughter strand (which carries the replication error) as the template. Consequently, the repair synthesis writes the erroneous base into the parental strand, eliminating the mismatch by converting both strands to the mutant sequence. Therefore, for each recognized mismatch, the error is actively fixed as a mutation with probability\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}|\\text{invMMR}} = 1,\n$$\nand the per-site mutation rate from replication errors becomes\n$$\nr_{\\text{invMMR}} = p \\times 1.\n$$\nComparing to the absence of MMR,\n$$\n\\frac{r_{\\text{invMMR}}}{r_{\\text{noMMR}}} = \\frac{p}{p/2} = 2,\n$$\nso the mutation rate is higher than in a cell merely lacking MMR. In practice, it could be even higher if the erroneous repair patch synthesis introduces additional errors, but the key point is that the defect drives active and permanent incorporation of replication errors into the parental template.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: once the parental strand is overwritten to match the erroneous daughter, the mismatch disappears; there is no futile cycle.\n- B is incorrect: the system is not inactive; it is actively repairing in the wrong direction, which is worse than inactivity.\n- C is incorrect: the original mutation is not corrected; it is propagated into the parental strand.\n- D is correct: replication errors are actively and permanently incorporated, producing a mutation rate higher than that seen when MMR is simply absent.\n- E is incorrect: MMR acts post-replicatively in this context and would not stall the replication fork.\n\nTherefore, the most significant and direct consequence is a markedly elevated mutation rate due to active fixation of replication errors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2041403"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves our analysis from the level of a single cell to the dynamics of an entire population. Here, you will develop a simple quantitative model to compare the emergence of a beneficial trait in two bacterial populations—one with a functional MMR system and one without. This problem challenges you to connect molecular-level events, such as the rate of enzymatic repair and the segregation of DNA during division, to macroscopic, evolutionary outcomes under selective pressure, offering a glimpse into how molecular fidelity shapes the fate of populations. [@problem_id:2041356]", "problem": "A bacterial culture is grown in a chemostat under conditions that maintain a constant population size. A specially designed plasmid is introduced into the bacteria at time $t=0$. This plasmid carries a tetracycline resistance gene, but a G:T base pair mismatch at a critical site renders the gene product non-functional. All bacteria in the initial population contain this non-functional version of the plasmid.\n\nThe chemostat contains a low concentration of tetracycline, which imparts a selective pressure. Bacteria that manage to acquire a functional version of the resistance gene (G:C at the critical site) exhibit a Malthusian growth parameter $r_f$. Bacteria with a non-functional gene (either the initial G:T mismatch or a subsequent A:T pair) have a lower growth parameter $r_{nf}$.\n\nTwo parallel experiments are conducted with different bacterial strains:\n1.  **`mutS-` Strain**: This strain has a deficient Mismatch Repair (MMR) system. The G:T mismatch is not actively repaired. Upon plasmid replication during cell division, the G-strand templates a C, and the T-strand templates an A. Consequently, each division of a cell with a G:T plasmid yields one daughter cell with a functional G:C plasmid and one daughter cell with a non-functional A:T plasmid.\n2.  **Wild-Type (WT) Strain**: This strain has a fully functional, methyl-directed MMR system. The system recognizes the G:T mismatch and repairs it to a functional G:C pair at a specific rate of $k_{rep}$ per cell, using the methylated parental G-strand as the template. This repair process is independent of cell division.\n\nLet $f_{\\text{mutS-}}(t)$ and $f_{\\text{WT}}(t)$ represent the frequency of cells carrying the functional tetracycline resistance gene in the `mutS-` and WT cultures, respectively.

Thus, the initial rate $\\frac{df}{dt}\\big|_{t=0}$ is determined solely by the conversion flux from non-functional to functional states.\n\nWT strain (MMR active): Each cell with a G:T mismatch is repaired to G:C at rate $k_{rep}$ per cell, independently of division.

Cells with non-functional genes (including G:T) divide at Malthusian rate $r_{nf}$, so at $t=0$ the population-wide rate of divisions from the $N$ G:T cells is $r_{nf}N$.
