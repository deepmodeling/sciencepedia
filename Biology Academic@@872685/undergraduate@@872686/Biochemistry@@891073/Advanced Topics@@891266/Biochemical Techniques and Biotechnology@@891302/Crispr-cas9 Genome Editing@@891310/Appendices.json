The gene's DNA sequence is provided below, with the top strand being the coding strand. The gene contains two exons and one intron. The first exon spans from nucleotide position 1 to 30, and the second exon begins at nucleotide position 61.\n\n5'- AATTGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGATTACAGATTACAGATTACAGGCTATAGCTAGCTAGCTA -3'\n3'- TTAACCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCCATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACCTAATGTCTAATGTCTAATGTCCTGATATCGATCGATCGAT -5'\n\nTo disrupt this gene, the biologist plans to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9). This system employs a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific location in the genome. The targeting specificity is determined by two factors: a 20-nucleotide sequence within the sgRNA and a DNA motif called the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nThe rules for SpCas9 targeting are as follows:\n1.  The Cas9 enzyme first recognizes the PAM sequence on the DNA. For SpCas9, the PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where 'N' can be any of the four DNA bases (A, T, C, G).\n2.  The PAM sequence must be present on the non-template strand (the strand that is not used as a template for gRNA binding).\n3.  The 20-nucleotide target site, known as the protospacer, is the sequence on the non-template strand located immediately upstream (to the 5' side) of the PAM sequence.\n4.  The 20-nucleotide guide portion of the sgRNA must have a sequence that is complementary to the template strand at the target site. This is equivalent to saying the sgRNA sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence, with all instances of Thymine (T) replaced by Uracil (U).\n\nYour task is to design a 20-nucleotide sgRNA sequence that will direct the Cas9 nuclease to cut as close as possible to the beginning of the second exon.\n\nProvide the sequence of this 20-nucleotide guide RNA in the 5' to 3' orientation.", "solution": "We are given that the top strand is the coding strand and that exon 2 begins at nucleotide position 61. For SpCas9, the targeting rules to apply are:\n- The PAM must be 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand.\n- The 20-nt protospacer is immediately upstream (5' side) of the PAM on the same non-template strand.\n- The sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence with all T replaced by U (RNA), and is written 5' to 3'.\n\nIndex the provided top-strand sequence and mark the exon boundary at position 61. The intron spans positions 31 to 60, so the second exon begins at position 61. We search for the nearest PAM 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand as close as possible to position 61. Taking the top strand as the non-template strand for a potential target, scan for NGG near position 61. In the second exon region, the first occurrence of NGG on the top strand is at positions 81–83, which is 5'-AGG-3'.\n\nBy rule, the corresponding 20-nt protospacer on the non-template (top) strand is the sequence immediately upstream of that PAM, i.e., positions 61 through 80 inclusive. Reading the top strand from position 61 to 80 gives the 20-nt protospacer:\nGATTACAGATTACAGATTAC.\n\nThis site places the protospacer starting exactly at the beginning of exon 2 (position 61), and the PAM-adjacent cut by SpCas9 would occur upstream of the PAM, keeping the cleavage close to the exon start. Checking the opposite orientation (PAM on the bottom strand), which would require a 5'-CCN-3' motif on the top strand near position 61, reveals no CCN motif close enough to yield a cut closer to position 61 than the top-strand PAM at 81–83. Therefore, the top-strand PAM at 81–83 provides the closest feasible cut to the beginning of exon 2.\n\nThe sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer with T replaced by U, written 5' to 3'.

This troubleshooting practice [@problem_id:2038149] explores a common reason for CRISPR-Cas9 editing failure: an incorrect or missing Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). By analyzing a hypothetical failed experiment, you will learn to appreciate that the Cas9 enzyme’s activity is absolutely dependent on the presence of this short DNA sequence adjacent to the target.", "problem": "A researcher is using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system derived from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9) to disrupt a target gene in a culture of mammalian cells. The system relies on a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the SpCas9 nuclease to a specific 20-nucleotide sequence on the DNA, known as the protospacer. Successful binding and cleavage require the SpCas9 enzyme to first recognize a specific short DNA sequence located immediately downstream of the protospacer.\n\nThe researcher has designed a gRNA with the sequence `5'-AGACUCAUCGUCCAUUACGG-3'`. This gRNA is intended to guide the SpCas9 enzyme to the following region of the target gene:\n\nTarget DNA region:\nNon-target strand: `5'-...CTTAGACTCATCGTCCATTACGGGTCACATAG...-3'`\nTarget strand: `3'-...GAATCTGAGTAGCAGGTAATGCCAGTGTATC...-5'`\n\nAfter introducing both the gRNA and active SpCas9 enzyme into the cells, the researcher finds that the target DNA is not cleaved. Assuming the gRNA sequence is correct and was delivered efficiently into the cells along with a functional SpCas9 enzyme, which of the following is the most likely reason for the experiment's failure?\n\nA. The gRNA sequence is complementary to the non-target strand, not the target strand.\n\nB. The protospacer sequence does not have the required Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) immediately upstream of it.\n\nC. The gRNA is binding to an off-target site elsewhere in the genome with higher affinity.\n\nD. The non-target DNA strand lacks the correct Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) immediately downstream of the protospacer.\n\nE. The target DNA is a double helix, and the Cas9 enzyme can only cleave single-stranded DNA.", "solution": "We proceed by applying the fundamental targeting rule for SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes: cleavage requires a 20-nucleotide protospacer that is immediately followed on the non-target strand by a 5'-NGG-3' Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The gRNA base-pairs with the target DNA strand; therefore, the gRNA sequence (written with U in RNA) is typically identical to the non-target DNA strand except for U in place of T.\n\nStep 1: Verify the protospacer match.\nThe gRNA is 5'-AGACUCAUCGUCCAUUACGG-3'. Converting U to T for comparison with DNA gives 5'-AGACTCATCGTCCATTACGG-3'. Inspecting the provided non-target strand,\n`5'-...CTTAGACTCATCGTCCATTACGGGTCACATAG...-3'`,\nwe observe that the 20-nt segment 5'-AGACTCATCGTCCATTACGG-3' is present contiguously. This confirms the intended protospacer is correctly located on the non-target strand, which in turn implies the gRNA is complementary to the target strand as expected. Therefore, option A is not a valid reason for failure.\n\nStep 2: Check the PAM requirement on the non-target strand.\nFor SpCas9, the PAM must be 5'-NGG-3' on the non-target strand immediately downstream (on the 3' side) of the 20-nt protospacer. The three nucleotides directly following the identified protospacer on the non-target strand are \"GTC\" (as shown by ...ATTACGG GTC...). The trinucleotide \"GTC\" is not of the form \"NGG\". Hence, the essential PAM is absent at the required position.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate alternatives.\n- Option B states the PAM is immediately upstream of the protospacer, which is incorrect for SpCas9; the PAM must be immediately downstream on the non-target strand.\n- Option C posits off-target binding; while possible in general, the explicit sequence context here shows a definitive design violation (absent PAM), which more parsimoniously explains the failure.\n- Option E is false because SpCas9 cleaves double-stranded DNA.\n\nConclusion: The most likely reason for failure is the absence of the required 5'-NGG-3' PAM immediately downstream of the protospacer on the non-target strand, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2038149"}, {"introduction": "Once you have designed your guide RNA and performed the experiment, how do you confirm that the gene was actually edited?

The strategy relies on the Cas9 nuclease to create a double-strand break at a target site within an exon. This break is subsequently repaired by the cell's Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway, an error-prone process that frequently introduces small insertions or deletions of nucleotides, collectively known as indels. These indels can cause a frameshift mutation, leading to a non-functional protein.\n\nTo screen for successful editing, the researcher designs a pair of primers for a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) that flank the CRISPR target site.
