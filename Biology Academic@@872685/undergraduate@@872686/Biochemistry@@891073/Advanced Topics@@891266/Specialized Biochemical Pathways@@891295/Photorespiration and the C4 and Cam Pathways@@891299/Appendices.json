The oxygenase activity of RuBisCO, which is favored under conditions of high temperature and low $\\text{CO}_2$ concentration, produces one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) and one molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate. While 3-PGA is a standard intermediate of the Calvin cycle, 2-phosphoglycolate is a metabolically toxic compound that must be recycled through a salvage pathway. The first committed step of this photorespiratory salvage pathway is the dephosphorylation of 2-phosphoglycolate to glycolate, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoglycolate phosphatase within the chloroplast stroma.\n\nImagine a C3 plant that is actively photosynthesizing. A highly specific chemical inhibitor is applied, resulting in the complete and instantaneous inactivation of all phosphoglycolate phosphatase enzymes. Assuming the environmental conditions favor a significant rate of photorespiration, which of the following options describes the most immediate and direct consequence within the plant's chloroplasts?\n\nA.

Thus, the immediate and direct metabolic consequence of its rapid accumulation is inhibition of the Calvin cycle. This inhibition quickly suppresses Calvin cycle flux and thereby leads toward cessation of the cycle.\n\nWith this, each option can be evaluated:\n- Option A is incorrect: light reactions do not immediately increase to compensate; if anything, Calvin cycle inhibition would limit $\\text{NADP}^{+}$ regeneration and can feed back to slow the light reactions.\n- Option B is incorrect: glycolate cannot accumulate because its formation is blocked when $v_{\\text{PGP}}=0$.\n- Option C is incorrect: RuBP will not rise; its regeneration requires Calvin cycle function, which is inhibited by 2-PG, while RuBisCO oxygenase continues to consume RuBP initially.\n- Option D is correct: 2-PG accumulates and inhibits key Calvin cycle enzymes, leading to cessation of the cycle.\n- Option E is incorrect: mitochondrial $\\text{CO}_2$ release via the photorespiratory pathway depends on glycolate flux; blocking PGP cuts this flux upstream, so an immediate increase does not occur.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct consequence is described by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2062271"}, {"introduction": "C4 photosynthesis represents an elegant solution to the problem of photorespiration, but this metabolic advantage comes at an energetic price.
