Two distinct types of cations are physiologically required: a monovalent cation and a divalent cation.\n\nFirst, the divalent cation requirement is primarily fulfilled by $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. The $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ion coordinates with the phosphate groups of nucleotide substrates (e.g., $\\mathrm{ADP}$ and $\\mathrm{ATP}$), reducing electrostatic repulsion and stabilizing the transition state during phosphoryl transfer.

This thought experiment probes the critical role of iron in hemoglobin by asking why replacing it with magnesium—the central ion in chlorophyll—results in a complete loss of function. This practice challenges you to consider the unique electronic features of transition metals, such as variable oxidation states and d-orbital interactions, which are indispensable for tasks like reversible oxygen transport [@problem_id:2074036].", "problem": "Hemoglobin is the protein responsible for transporting molecular oxygen ($O_2$) in the blood of vertebrates. Its function relies on a prosthetic group called heme, which consists of a porphyrin ring with a central iron ion in the ferrous, Fe(II), state. Imagine a hypothetical experiment where a biochemist synthesizes a modified \"mag-hemoglobin\" in which the central Fe(II) ion of every heme group is precisely replaced by a magnesium ion, Mg(II), which is the central ion in the related chlorophyll molecule. This mag-hemoglobin is found to be completely non-functional for reversible oxygen transport.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the primary and most fundamental chemical reason for this loss of function?\n\nA. The Mg(II) ion is significantly larger than the Fe(II) ion, causing steric strain within the porphyrin ring that blocks the oxygen-binding site.\n\nB. Mg(II) has a fixed, stable +2 oxidation state and lacks valence d-orbitals, making it incapable of the electronic interactions required for reversible O₂ binding.\n\nC. The +2 charge of the Mg(II) ion is too low to electrostatically hold the dianionic porphyrin ring, leading to the rapid dissociation of the prosthetic group from the protein.\n\nD. The Mg(II) ion has a strong intrinsic preference for a tetrahedral coordination geometry, which is incompatible with the square planar N4-coordination environment provided by the porphyrin ring.\n\nE. The substitution of iron with magnesium causes the entire hemoglobin protein tetramer to misfold into a non-functional conformation, completely burying the modified heme groups.", "solution": "Hemoglobin’s reversible binding of molecular oxygen relies on transition-metal ligand-field and redox chemistry at the heme iron. In deoxyhemoglobin, the metal is Fe(II) coordinated equatorially to the porphyrin $N_{4}$ macrocycle and axially to a proximal histidine. Upon $O_{2}$ binding, the system forms a dioxygen adduct that is best described as having significant $O_{2}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Fe}$ sigma donation and $\\mathrm{Fe}\\rightarrow O_{2}$ $\\pi$ backbonding into the $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals of $O_{2}$, together with partial electron transfer that generates a resonance description between $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}-O_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}-O_{2}^{\\bullet -}$. This process requires two fundamental capabilities at the metal center: (i) accessible valence $d$ orbitals to support the ligand-field interactions and $\\pi$ backbonding, and (ii) the ability to undergo a reversible change in oxidation state between $+2$ and $+3$, stabilizing a superoxo-like adduct.\n\nFe(II) satisfies both requirements: $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ has a $3d^{6}$ configuration (from $\\mathrm{Fe}$: $[\\mathrm{Ar}]3d^{6}4s^{2}$ giving $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}: [\\mathrm{Ar}]3d^{6}$), providing occupied and empty $d$ orbitals of appropriate symmetry for $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ interactions, and it can be oxidized reversibly to $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ within the protein environment. The bound $O_{2}$ is stabilized as a superoxo-like ligand via backbonding, enabling reversible binding and release.\n\nBy contrast, Mg(II) is a main-group ion with electron configuration $\\mathrm{Mg}: [\\mathrm{Ne}]3s^{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}: [\\mathrm{Ne}]$, which means it lacks valence $d$ orbitals. As a hard, closed-shell $s$-block cation with a fixed and highly stable $+2$ oxidation state, it neither provides the $d_{\\pi}$ orbitals required for $\\pi$ backbonding into $O_{2}\\ \\pi^{*}$ nor can it access a higher oxidation state such as $+3$ to accommodate partial electron transfer to dioxygen. Consequently, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ cannot form the redox-active, backbonding-stabilized superoxo adduct that underpins reversible $O_{2}$ binding in heme proteins. This is the primary and most fundamental chemical reason for the loss of function upon replacing Fe(II) with Mg(II).\n\nThe alternative options do not address the key electronic requirements. The size/steric argument is not primary, as porphyrins can stably host $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ (e.g., chlorophyll), showing that the macrocycle accommodates Mg without catastrophic steric blockage. The charge argument is incorrect, since a $+2$ cation fitting a dianionic porphyrin is standard for metalloporphyrins and does not force dissociation. The geometry argument is not fundamental: $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ commonly adopts octahedral or higher coordination and can be stably ligated by porphyrin $N_{4}$ equatorially with axial ligands, as in chlorophyll. The protein misfolding argument is secondary and not required to explain the observed failure; even in isolation, a Mg-porphyrin cannot engage in the necessary redox/backbonding interactions for $O_{2}$ binding.\n\nTherefore, the essential reason is the absence of transition-metal $d$-orbital and redox chemistry in $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, which prevents the electronic interactions required for reversible dioxygen binding.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2074036"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems must often select a specific metal ion from a cellular environment containing a mixture of similar ions.
