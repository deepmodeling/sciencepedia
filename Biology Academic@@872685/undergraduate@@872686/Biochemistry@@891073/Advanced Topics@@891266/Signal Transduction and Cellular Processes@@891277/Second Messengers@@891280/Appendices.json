Through a series of binding and activity assays, they determine that the receptor for hypotensin is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Further analysis reveals that upon hormone binding, this receptor exclusively associates with a heterotrimeric G-protein containing an inhibitory alpha subunit, denoted as $G_{\\alpha i}$. Given that the primary target of G-protein alpha subunits in this particular cell type is the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, what is the predicted immediate effect on the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) when the cell is stimulated by hypotensin?\n\nA) A significant increase.\n\nB) A significant decrease.\n\nC) No change.\n\nD) An initial, transient increase followed by a sharp decrease.\n\nE) A slow, oscillatory behavior.", "solution": "The question asks to predict the immediate effect of a hormone binding to a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is linked to an inhibitory G-protein alpha subunit ($G_{\\alpha i}$) on the intracellular concentration of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nStep 1: Understand the baseline state.\nIn a typical cell, there is a basal level of activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into cAMP. Simultaneously, another class of enzymes called phosphodiesterases constantly degrades cAMP into AMP. The balance between the synthesis by adenylyl cyclase and degradation by phosphodiesterases establishes a steady-state, basal concentration of intracellular cAMP.\n\nStep 2: Trace the signaling cascade upon hormone binding.\nThe signaling pathway is initiated when the hormone, hypotensin, binds to its specific GPCR on the cell surface.\n\nStep 3: G-protein activation.\nThe binding of the hormone induces a conformational change in the GPCR. This activated receptor now functions as a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) for its associated heterotrimeric G-protein. The G-protein consists of three subunits: $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$. In its inactive state, the $\\alpha$ subunit is bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP). The activated GPCR facilitates the release of GDP from the $\\alpha$ subunit and its replacement by Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), which is more abundant in the cytosol.\n\nStep 4: Subunit dissociation and effector interaction.\nThe problem states that the receptor is coupled to a $G_{\\alpha i}$ subunit. When $G_{\\alpha i}$ binds GTP, it undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from both the GPCR and the $\\beta\\gamma$ dimer. This free $G_{\\alpha i}$-GTP complex is now the active signaling molecule.\n\nStep 5: Effect on adenylyl cyclase.\nThe \"i\" in $G_{\\alpha i}$ stands for \"inhibitory\". The primary function of the activated $G_{\\alpha i}$-GTP complex is to bind to and inhibit the enzyme adenylyl cyclase.\n\nStep 6: Impact on cAMP levels.\nAdenylyl cyclase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing cAMP from ATP. By inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, the $G_{\\alpha i}$-GTP complex reduces the rate of cAMP production. While the degradation of cAMP by phosphodiesterases continues at its normal rate, the synthesis is now suppressed.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion.\nThe net result of decreased synthesis and continued degradation is a rapid drop in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Therefore, the immediate effect of stimulating the cell with hypotensin is a significant decrease in cAMP levels.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\nA) A significant increase: This would occur if the receptor were coupled to a stimulatory alpha subunit, $G_{\\alpha s}$.\nB) A significant decrease: This is consistent with the inhibitory action of $G_{\\alpha i}$ on adenylyl cyclase.\nC) No change: This would imply that $G_{\\alpha i}$ does not interact with adenylyl cyclase, which is incorrect.\nD) An initial, transient increase followed by a sharp decrease: This describes a more complex feedback mechanism not indicated by the problem's immediate scope.\nE) A slow, oscillatory behavior: This is characteristic of other second messenger systems (like $Ca^{2+}$) and is not the primary, direct effect of a simple $G_{\\alpha i}$ pathway activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2074290"}, {"introduction": "Here, we shift our focus to another crucial second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$), and its pivotal role in modulating intracellular calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) levels. Through a thought experiment involving direct microinjection, you will dissect this signaling cascade to pinpoint the immediate downstream target of $IP_3$. This approach mirrors a powerful experimental strategy used by cell biologists to untangle complex cellular pathways by isolating the function of a single component.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating intracellular signaling pathways in a quiescent (non-dividing) mammalian fibroblast. The standard signaling cascade in this cell type for a particular growth factor involves the activation of phospholipase C, which then cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PIP_2$) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$). To isolate a specific part of this pathway, the biologist uses a microinjection technique to introduce a significant concentration of pure $IP_3$ directly into the cytosol of a single, otherwise unstimulated cell. Assuming the cell has all the necessary downstream components, what is the most direct and immediate consequence of this artificial increase in cytosolic $IP_3$?\n\nA. Activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to a surge in cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nB. Binding of $IP_3$ to protein kinase C (PKC), leading to its direct activation.\n\nC. Secretion of signaling molecules from the cell through exocytosis.\n\nD. Opening of ligand-gated ion channels on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nE. Increased activity of the sodium-potassium pump ($Na^+/K^+$-ATPase) on the plasma membrane.", "solution": "The canonical pathway is that phospholipase C (PLC) cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate:\n$$\nPIP_2 \\xrightarrow{\\text{PLC}} DAG + IP_3.\n$$\nThe specific role of $IP_3$ is to bind the $IP_3$ receptor ($IP_3R$), which is a ligand-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channel located on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

This practice delves into the concept of signal integration by examining how stimulatory ($G_{\\alpha s}$) and inhibitory ($G_{\\alpha i}$) pathways converge to regulate cAMP levels. By analyzing the effect of a toxin that disables the inhibitory \"brake\" on the system, you will develop a deeper understanding of how cells achieve precise control over their internal state.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a pancreatic cell, the intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is tightly regulated by two opposing G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways. A stimulatory hormone, Hormone S, binds to its receptor, causing the activation of a stimulatory G-protein ($G_s$). The active alpha subunit of Gs ($G_{\\alpha s}$) then stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cAMP. Conversely, an inhibitory hormone, Hormone I, binds to its receptor, leading to the activation of an inhibitory G-protein ($G_i$). The active alpha subunit of Gi ($G_{\\alpha i}$) inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity.\n\nA researcher treats these cells with pertussis toxin. This toxin is known to covalently modify the $G_{\\alpha i}$ subunit, locking it in its inactive, GDP-bound state and preventing it from being activated by its receptor. Following this treatment, the cells are simultaneously exposed to a concentration of Hormone S and a concentration of Hormone I that, in an untreated cell, would result in a small, net increase in the basal cAMP level.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected effect on the intracellular cAMP concentration in the pertussis toxin-treated cells under these conditions?\n\nA. cAMP levels will be significantly elevated, far exceeding the level seen in untreated cells exposed to both hormones, and even exceeding the level seen with Hormone S alone.\n\nB. cAMP levels will be suppressed below the basal level because the pertussis toxin disrupts overall GPCR function.\n\nC. cAMP levels will be identical to the basal level because the stimulatory and inhibitory effects will now cancel each other out.\n\nD. cAMP levels will be significantly elevated, reaching a level comparable to that produced by stimulation with Hormone S alone in an untreated cell.\n\nE. cAMP levels will be suppressed below the basal level because the pertussis toxin forces the $G_{\\alpha i}$ subunit into a permanently active, inhibitory state.", "solution": "Define adenylyl cyclase activity as the net result of basal activity plus modulation by $G_s$ and $G_i$. Let the intracellular cAMP production rate be proportional to adenylyl cyclase activity. Represent the net modulation as\n$A_{\\text{AC}}=A_{0}+k_{s}S_{\\text{act}}-k_{i}I_{\\text{act}},$\nwhere $A_{0}$ is basal activity, $S_{\\text{act}}$ is the effective activation of $G_{\\alpha s}$ by Hormone S, $I_{\\text{act}}$ is the effective activation of $G_{\\alpha i}$ by Hormone I, and $k_{s},k_{i}>0$ are coupling constants. In untreated cells exposed to both hormones, the problem states there is a small net increase above basal, which implies $k_{s}S_{\\text{act}}>k_{i}I_{\\text{act}}$ but with partial opposition.\n\nPertussis toxin covalently modifies $G_{\\alpha i}$, locking it in the inactive GDP-bound state and preventing receptor-mediated activation. Therefore, under pertussis toxin,\n$I_{\\text{act}}=0.$\nSubstituting gives\n$A_{\\text{AC,PTX}}=A_{0}+k_{s}S_{\\text{act}}.$\nThis is identical to the expression for stimulation by Hormone S alone in an untreated cell, because the inhibitory term is eliminated but there is no additional stimulatory effect beyond Gs activation. Consequently, cAMP levels will be significantly elevated relative to basal and to the untreated both-hormone condition, reaching a level comparable to that produced by Hormone S alone.\n\nOptions analysis:\n- A is incorrect because removal of Gi does not enhance Gs beyond S-alone; no mechanism produces levels exceeding S-alone.\n- B is incorrect because pertussis toxin does not disrupt Gs; it specifically inhibits Gi activation.\n- C is incorrect because there is no cancellation; the inhibitory pathway is inoperative.\n- D is correct as shown above.\n- E is incorrect because pertussis toxin locks $G_{\\alpha i}$ inactive, not active.\n\nThus, the expected effect is elevation to the level comparable to Hormone S alone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2074271"}]}
