The native G-alpha subunits, $G\\alpha_s$ and $G\\alpha_q$, normally mediate distinct downstream pathways. $G\\alpha_s$ activates adenylyl cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP). $G\\alpha_q$ activates phospholipase C (PLC), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP$_2$) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP$_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).

To solve this, we must understand the domain structure and function of G-alpha subunits.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure and function of the chimeric G-alpha protein.**\nG-alpha proteins are modular. The specificity of their interactions is determined by distinct domains:\n- The **N-terminal domain** is primarily responsible for the interaction with the corresponding G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It helps dock the G-protein to the activated receptor.\n- The **C-terminal region**, which includes parts of the GTPase domain and specific loops (like Switch II), is primarily responsible for binding to and activating the downstream effector enzyme.\n\nThe problem states the chimera is constructed as follows:\n- **N-terminus:** From $G\\alpha_s$. This domain mediates interaction with receptors that normally activate $G\\alpha_s$.\n- **C-terminus:** From $G\\alpha_q$. This domain mediates the interaction with the effector enzyme normally activated by $G\\alpha_q$.\n\nTherefore, the chimeric protein will be recognized and activated by receptors that normally bind $G\\alpha_s$, but it will in turn activate the effector enzyme associated with $G\\alpha_q$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the receptor and its normal signaling partner.**\nThe stimulus is a $\\beta$-adrenergic agonist. This agonist binds to and activates $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors. In a normal physiological context, activated $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors couple to the stimulatory G-protein, $G\\alpha_s$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the interaction between the activated receptor and the chimeric protein.**\nSince the chimeric protein possesses the N-terminal receptor-interacting domain of $G\\alpha_s$, it will be successfully recognized and activated by the agonist-bound $\\beta$-adrenergic receptor. Upon activation, the chimeric protein will exchange its bound GDP for GTP and dissociate from its $\\beta\\gamma$ subunits, becoming active.\n\n**Step 4: Determine which effector enzyme the activated chimera will act upon.**\nThe active, GTP-bound chimeric protein must now interact with a downstream effector. The specificity of this interaction is determined by its C-terminal effector-binding domain, which is derived from $G\\alpha_q$. The canonical effector for $G\\alpha_q$ is Phospholipase C (PLC). The chimera lacks the C-terminal domain from $G\\alpha_s$, so it cannot bind to or activate adenylyl cyclase.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the downstream second messenger production.**\nThe activated chimeric protein will bind to and activate PLC. Activated PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of a membrane lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP$_2$), into two second messengers:\n- **Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP$_3$):** A soluble molecule that diffuses into the cytoplasm and binds to IP$_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing the release of stored Ca$^{2+}$ into the cytosol.\n- **Diacylglycerol (DAG):** A lipid molecule that remains in the plasma membrane and, along with the elevated cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$, activates Protein Kinase C (PKC).\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence of stimulating these cells will be the activation of the PLC pathway.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given options.**\n- **A. A significant increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP and subsequent activation of Protein Kinase A (PKA).** This would be the result if the native $G\\alpha_s$ were present. It is incorrect because the chimera's C-terminus is from $G\\alpha_q$ and cannot activate adenylyl cyclase.\n- **B. A significant increase in the activity of PLC, leading to elevated intracellular levels of IP$_3$ and DAG.** This matches our prediction. The receptor for $G\\alpha_s$ is activated, which activates the chimera. The chimera then activates the effector for $G\\alpha_q$, which is PLC.\n- **C. A simultaneous increase in the activities of both adenylyl cyclase and PLC.** This is incorrect. The chimera has only one type of effector-binding domain (from $G\\alpha_q$), so it can only activate one type of effector (PLC).\n- **D. A significant decrease in the intracellular concentration of cAMP due to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.** This describes the action of an inhibitory G-protein, $G\\alpha_i$, which is not involved in this scenario.\n- **E. No significant change in the levels of any second messengers, as the chimeric protein is unable to couple to the receptor.** This is incorrect. The presence of the $G\\alpha_s$ N-terminus ensures proper coupling to the $\\beta$-adrenergic receptor.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2076401"}, {"introduction": "Signal transduction pathways are not just about which proteins interact, but also about the dynamics of those interactions over time.

The binding of a single hormone molecule results in the activation of a single GPCR, which then acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for its associated heterotrimeric G-protein. The activated Gα subunit, bound to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), dissociates and activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Active adenylyl cyclase converts Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP). Finally, cAMP molecules bind to and activate Protein Kinase A (PKA).\n\nAssume the following simplified kinetic parameters for the process within a single cell, starting from the moment the single GPCR becomes active:\n\n*   The single activated GPCR remains active for the entire duration of the experiment.\n*   The activated GPCR activates G-proteins at a constant rate, $R_G = 120$ G-proteins per second.\n*   In a normal (wild-type) cell, the intrinsic Guanosine Triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the Gα subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP, inactivating the subunit after an average lifetime of $t_G = 0.400$ seconds.\n*   Each active Gα subunit binds to and activates one adenylyl cyclase enzyme.\n*   A single active adenylyl cyclase molecule produces cAMP at a constant rate, $k_{cat} = 1500$ molecules per second.\n*   The activation of one molecule of PKA requires the cooperative binding of exactly 4 molecules of cAMP.\n*   Assume that the concentrations of all inactive components (G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase, PKA) and substrates (GTP, ATP) are non-limiting throughout the experiment.\n\nNow, consider a mutant cell line where the Gα subunit has a mutation that completely abolishes its intrinsic GTPase activity.
