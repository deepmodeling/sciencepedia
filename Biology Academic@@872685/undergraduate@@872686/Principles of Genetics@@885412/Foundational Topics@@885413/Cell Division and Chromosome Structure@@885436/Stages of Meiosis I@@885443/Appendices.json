Therefore the haploid number is $n = \\frac{2n}{2} = \\frac{36}{2} = 18$.\n\nDefinition and application:\n- In prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents (tetrads). The number of bivalents at metaphase I equals the haploid number $n$, because each bivalent consists of one pair of homologous chromosomes.\nThus, the number of bivalents at metaphase I is $n = 18$.\n\n- Meiosis I is a reductional division: homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles, but sister chromatids remain joined at their centromeres. Chromosome number is counted by centromeres; therefore, after telophase I and cytokinesis, each secondary spermatocyte contains one chromosome from each homologous pair, i.e., $n = 18$ chromosomes, each still consisting of two sister chromatids.\n\nConclusion: bivalents at metaphase I $= 18$; chromosomes per secondary spermatocyte after telophase I $= 18$.

This exercise [@problem_id:1522327] challenges you to distinguish between chromosome number and DNA content, a common point of confusion. By following the changes from a non-dividing cell through DNA replication and into Metaphase I, you will clarify how the cell prepares for and executes the first meiotic division.", "problem": "In a specific diploid Eukaryotic organism, a typical non-dividing somatic cell, which is in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, is analyzed and found to have a total mass of DNA in its nucleus designated as $2C$. Another cell from the same organism, a germline cell, enters the process of meiosis to produce gametes. Assuming the diploid chromosome number for this organism is $2n$, what are the DNA content and the number of chromosomes present in this germline cell when it reaches the stage of metaphase I?\n\nA) DNA content $C$, $n$ chromosomes\n\nB) DNA content $2C$, $2n$ chromosomes\n\nC) DNA content $2C$, $n$ chromosomes\n\nD) DNA content $4C$, $2n$ chromosomes\n\nE) DNA content $4C$, $4n$ chromosomes", "solution": "We are told that in this organism, a typical non-dividing diploid somatic cell in G1 has nuclear DNA content $2C$. By convention, $C$ denotes the DNA mass of a haploid genome, so a diploid G1 cell has $2n$ chromosomes (one chromatid per chromosome) and DNA content $2C$.\n\nA germline cell that enters meiosis first passes through interphase, including S-phase, before meiosis I. During S-phase, DNA replication doubles the DNA content without changing the chromosome number, because sister chromatids are joined at a single centromere and are counted as one chromosome until they separate. Therefore, after S-phase and entering prophase I and metaphase I:\n- DNA content: $2C \\to 4C$ due to replication.\n- Chromosome number: remains $2n$ because homologous chromosomes are still paired as bivalents, and sister chromatids have not separated.\n\nAt metaphase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes (each consisting of two sister chromatids) are aligned as bivalents; the reduction in chromosome number occurs at anaphase I when homologs separate. Thus, at metaphase I the germline cell has DNA content $4C$ and chromosome number $2n$.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1522327"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the mechanics of chromosome segregation, we now turn to one of its most profound consequences: the generation of genetic diversity. This problem [@problem_id:1522290] uses the principles of probability to explore the concept of independent assortment, where homologous chromosomes are sorted into daughter cells randomly. This thought experiment, which makes a simplifying assumption to isolate this single mechanism, demonstrates how Meiosis I shuffles parental chromosomes to create unique genetic combinations.", "problem": "An organism's diploid somatic cells contain a total of 8 chromosomes. This set of chromosomes consists of homologous pairs, with one chromosome of each pair inherited from the paternal parent and the other from the maternal parent. During meiosis I, these homologous chromosomes segregate to form secondary gametocytes. Assuming that no crossing over occurs and that the orientation of each homologous pair at the metaphase I plate is random and independent of all other pairs, what is the probability that a single secondary gametocyte, chosen at random after the completion of meiosis I, will contain a set of chromosomes that are exclusively of paternal origin?\n\nExpress your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a daughter cell after meiosis I contains only chromosomes from the paternal parent.\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of homologous chromosome pairs in the organism. The diploid number of chromosomes is given as $2n = 8$. This means the haploid number is $n = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Therefore, the organism has 4 pairs of homologous chromosomes. In each pair, one chromosome is of paternal origin and one is of maternal origin.\n\nDuring anaphase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes of each pair separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. The orientation of each pair at the metaphase plate is random. For any single homologous pair, there is an equal chance that the paternal chromosome will move to one pole and the maternal chromosome to the other.\n\nLet's consider one specific daughter cell that will be formed. For the first homologous pair, the probability that this cell receives the paternal chromosome is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability it receives the maternal chromosome is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the orientation of each homologous pair is independent of the others. This is the principle of independent assortment. To find the probability that the daughter cell receives the paternal chromosome from *all* pairs, we must multiply the individual probabilities for each pair.\n\n$$P(\\text{all paternal}) = P(\\text{paternal from pair 1}) \\times P(\\text{paternal from pair 2}) \\times P(\\text{paternal from pair 3}) \\times P(\\text{paternal from pair 4})$$\n\n$$P(\\text{all paternal}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4$$\n\nCalculating this value gives:\n\n$$P(\\text{all paternal}) = \\frac{1^{4}}{2^{4}} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nThus, the probability that a single secondary gametocyte will contain only chromosomes of paternal origin is $\\frac{1}{16}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$$", "id": "1522290"}]}
