It is known that these two genes are located on two different pairs of homologous chromosomes (i.e., they are unlinked). Consider a single primary meiocyte from this organism as it undergoes meiosis.

In meiosis I (anaphase I), homologous chromosomes separate, while sister chromatids remain together. Therefore, at one pole, for each chromosome pair:\n- From the $C/c$ pair, the pole receives one homolog consisting of two sister chromatids. Because sister chromatids travel together at anaphase I and are identical with respect to the locus in the absence of recombination between the locus and the centromere, the alleles contributed at the $C$ locus must be either $\\{C, C\\}$ or $\\{c, c\\}$.\n- From the $D/d$ pair, similarly, the alleles must be either $\\{D, D\\}$ or $\\{d, d\\}$.\n\nHence, the multiset of alleles at one pole must have exactly two alleles from the $C$ locus and two from the $D$ locus, each as identical pairs.

This practice moves from the behavior of separate chromosome pairs to the interactions within a single pair, a key source of genetic novelty. You will analyze the consequences of a crossover event between two linked genes, revealing how new allelic combinations are formed on chromatids that were once identical. [@problem_id:1497596]", "problem": "In a diploid organism, two genes, designated $P$ and $Q$, are linked on the same autosome. An individual is heterozygous for both genes. This individual's genotype was established from a cross between one parent of genotype $PPQQ$ and another parent of genotype $ppqq$. During meiosis, in a primary spermatocyte from this individual, a single crossover event occurs between the locus of gene $P$ and the locus of gene $Q$. After Meiosis I concludes, two secondary spermatocytes are formed.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the allelic composition of the two sister chromatids that constitute the chromosome carrying these genes, within one of the resulting secondary spermatocytes?\n\nA. The two sister chromatids are identical, each carrying alleles $P$ and $Q$.\n\nB. One sister chromatid carries alleles $P$ and $Q$; the other carries alleles $p$ and $q$.\n\nC.

After DNA replication prior to meiosis, each homolog consists of two identical sister chromatids: one homolog as $PQ$ and $PQ$; the other as $pq$ and $pq$.\n\nA single crossover between the loci of $P$ and $Q$ occurs during prophase I between two non-sister chromatids, one from each homolog. A single crossover between the loci yields two recombinant chromatids and leaves the other two chromatids nonrecombinant. Specifically, if one chromatid from the $PQ$ homolog exchanges with one chromatid from the $pq$ homolog in the interval between $P$ and $Q$, the products are:\n- Recombinant chromatids: $Pq$ and $pQ$,\n- Nonrecombinant chromatids: $PQ$ and $pq$.\n\nThus, after the crossover, the two sister chromatids on the originally $PQ$ homolog are $PQ$ (unchanged) and $Pq$ (recombinant), and the two sister chromatids on the originally $pq$ homolog are $pq$ (unchanged) and $pQ$ (recombinant).\n\nAt anaphase I of meiosis, homologs (not sister chromatids) segregate into different secondary spermatocytes. Therefore, the two secondary spermatocytes produced at the end of meiosis I carry:\n- One with the homolog whose sister chromatids are $PQ$ and $Pq$,\n- The other with the homolog whose sister chromatids are $pq$ and $pQ$.\n\nWithin one of the resulting secondary spermatocytes, the two sister chromatids that constitute the chromosome carrying $P$ and $Q$ will therefore be non-identical and will be either $PQ$ and $Pq$ or $pq$ and $pQ$.
