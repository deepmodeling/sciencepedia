{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Mastering the cell cycle begins with a clear understanding of its \"bookkeeping\"—tracking the amount of genetic material as a cell prepares for division. A crucial event is the S phase, where each chromosome is precisely duplicated, creating sister chromatids. This exercise will test your ability to quantify the result of this replication, a foundational skill for analyzing both mitosis and meiosis. [@problem_id:1526038]", "problem": "A cytogeneticist is studying a newly discovered species of deep-sea cephalopod. Microscopic analysis of a somatic cell in the G1 phase of the cell cycle reveals that the diploid number of chromosomes (2n) for this species is 38. Another somatic cell from the same animal is isolated and observed at a later stage, specifically during the G2 phase, just before the onset of mitosis. How many sister chromatids are present in this single cell during the G2 phase?", "solution": "In the G1 phase, the cell has a diploid number of chromosomes, which is given as $2n = 38$. During the S phase, each of these 38 chromosomes is replicated. After replication, the cell, now in the G2 phase, still contains 38 chromosomes (as chromosome number is counted by centromeres), but each chromosome is composed of two identical sister chromatids.\n\nThe total number of sister chromatids is calculated by multiplying the number of chromosomes by 2:\nTotal sister chromatids = $38 \\times 2 = 76$.\n\nTherefore, the cell in the G2 phase has 76 sister chromatids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{76}$$", "id": "1526038"}, {"introduction": "The cell cycle is a sequence of distinct events, and it's vital to distinguish between the division of the nucleus (karyokinesis) and the division of the cell itself (cytokinesis). While they are normally coordinated, they are mechanistically separate. This problem explores a hypothetical scenario where nuclear division proceeds normally but cytokinesis fails, forcing us to consider the precise state of a cell when this final step is blocked. [@problem_id:1526033]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a novel antifungal compound, \"Inhibitin-C,\" using a culture of a haploid fungal species (where the somatic cell has a ploidy of $n$). The cells are synchronized at the G1 phase and then allowed to proceed through one full mitotic cell cycle. The researcher observes that Inhibitin-C has no effect on DNA replication (S phase) or the processes of nuclear division (karyokinesis), including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. However, the compound completely prevents cytokinesis, the physical division of the cell's cytoplasm.\n\nAssuming a single haploid cell from the G1 phase undergoes this process, which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the cell product immediately after nuclear division is complete but cytokinesis has failed?\n\nA. A single cell with one diploid ($2n$) nucleus.\n\nB. A single cell containing two genetically identical haploid ($n$) nuclei.\n\nC. A single cell with one tetraploid ($4n$) nucleus.\n\nD. Two distinct daughter cells, each with a haploid ($n$) nucleus.\n\nE. A single aneuploid cell with one nucleus.", "solution": "We begin with a single haploid cell in G1. By definition, a haploid nucleus has one complete set of chromosomes, so the ploidy is $n$. Let the DNA content in G1 be denoted symbolically as $C$.\n\nDuring S phase, DNA replication occurs, which doubles the DNA content but does not change ploidy. Therefore, after S phase, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids. The nucleus remains haploid (ploidy $n$), but DNA content becomes $2C$.\n\nDuring mitosis (karyokinesis: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase), sister chromatids separate and are distributed equally to opposite poles. Because mitosis preserves chromosome number, after nuclear division is complete, there are two daughter nuclei, each with ploidy $n$ and DNA content $C$. The two nuclei are genetically identical under normal mitosis, given the problem’s stipulation that nuclear division is unaffected.\n\nCytokinesis is specifically the division of the cytoplasm into two separate cells. The compound prevents cytokinesis completely, so although two daughter nuclei form, they remain within a single undivided cell. Thus, immediately after nuclear division is complete, the product is a single cell containing two genetically identical haploid ($n$) nuclei.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because mitosis does not fuse nuclei nor increase ploidy to produce a single $2n$ nucleus.\n- B is correct: a single cell containing two genetically identical haploid ($n$) nuclei.\n- C is incorrect because no tetraploid ($4n$) nucleus is produced by normal mitosis.\n- D is incorrect because cytokinesis failed, so two distinct daughter cells are not formed.\n- E is incorrect because mitosis proceeded normally, so no aneuploidy is produced.\n\nTherefore, the accurate description is a single cell containing two genetically identical haploid nuclei.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1526033"}, {"introduction": "The orderly progression through mitosis is not automatic; it is tightly controlled by a sophisticated molecular network that ensures events occur in the correct order. Key regulators like cyclins and the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) act as switches, turning processes on and off at the right time. This practice problem delves into this regulatory logic by asking you to predict the consequences of disabling a crucial \"off switch\" required for exiting mitosis. [@problem_id:1526054]", "problem": "A research team is investigating the regulation of the cell cycle in a cultured line of eukaryotic cells. They genetically engineer these cells to express a mutant form of mitotic cyclin. This mutant cyclin is fully capable of binding to and activating its partner cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), triggering the cell's entry into mitosis. However, the gene for this cyclin has been altered such that the protein it codes for is missing the \"destruction box\" (D-box), a short amino acid sequence that normally targets the protein for degradation by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) during late mitosis. Assume that all other cellular components, including securin (which also possesses a D-box), are normal and functional.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the terminal phenotype of a cell expressing only this mutant form of mitotic cyclin as it attempts to progress through mitosis?\n\nA. The cell will arrest at the metaphase-anaphase transition because the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) cannot be activated.\n\nB. The cell will arrest in metaphase with its chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate, as the sister chromatids will fail to separate.\n\nC. The cell will proceed through anaphase, separating its sister chromatids, but will then arrest with condensed chromosomes and will fail to undergo telophase and cytokinesis.\n\nD. The cell will fail to enter mitosis because the mutant cyclin cannot form a functional complex with its cyclin-dependent kinase.\n\nE. The cell will complete mitosis and cytokinesis normally, but will be unable to enter the G1 phase and will immediately re-replicate its DNA.", "solution": "Normal mitotic control logic:\n1) Entry into mitosis requires active mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes (e.g., cyclin B-CDK1, often termed MPF). These promote chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and spindle assembly.\n2) The metaphase-anaphase transition requires activation of APC/C bound to Cdc20. When the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied, APC/C targets D-box-containing substrates for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Two key APC/C substrates are securin and mitotic cyclins.\n3) Degradation of securin releases separase, which cleaves cohesin to trigger sister chromatid separation (anaphase). Degradation of mitotic cyclin inactivates CDK activity, which is necessary to exit mitosis: spindle disassembly, chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope reformation, cytokinesis, and resetting to G1.\n\nEffect of the engineered mutation:\n1) The mutant mitotic cyclin binds and activates CDK normally, so mitotic entry occurs.\n2) The mutant lacks the D-box, so APC/C cannot ubiquitinate and degrade this cyclin; therefore CDK activity remains high.\n3) Securin is normal and contains a D-box, so upon APC/C activation at the metaphase-anaphase transition, securin is degraded, separase is activated, and sister chromatids separate; thus anaphase proceeds.\n4) Because mitotic cyclin persists, CDK activity does not drop. High CDK activity blocks mitotic exit programs (chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope reassembly, cytokinesis) and prevents transition to G1.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because APC/C can be activated; its activation does not require cyclin degradation and, in fact, cyclin-CDK activity helps prime APC/C.\n- B is incorrect because securin is degradable; separase activation allows chromatid separation.\n- D is contradicted by the premise that the mutant activates CDK.\n- E is incorrect because mitotic exit requires cyclin degradation; with sustained CDK activity, the cell fails to complete telophase and cytokinesis and also cannot license replication origins for re-replication.\n\nTherefore, the terminal phenotype is progression into anaphase followed by arrest with condensed chromosomes and failure of telophase and cytokinesis, matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1526054"}]}
