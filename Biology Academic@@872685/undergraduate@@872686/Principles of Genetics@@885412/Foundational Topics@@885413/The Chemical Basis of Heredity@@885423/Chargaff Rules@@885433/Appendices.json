The segment is known to be a 50-base-pair double-stranded fragment. The researcher sequences one of the two strands of this fragment and obtains the following base count: 15 Guanine (G) bases, 10 Cytosine (C) bases, 12 Adenine (A) bases, and 13 Thymine (T) bases. The researcher is perplexed because the count of G does not equal C, and the count of A does not equal T, which seems to contradict Chargaff's rules.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate scientific explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The observation is a clear violation of Chargaff's rules and strongly indicates a fault in the sequencing machine or a significant sample contamination.\n\nB. The observation is expected because Chargaff's rules are only statistical approximations that hold true for entire genomes but not for short fragments of DNA like this 50-base-pair segment.\n\nC. The observation is explained by the fact that the sequencing data is from a single strand. Chargaff's rules apply to the base composition of the entire double-stranded molecule, not to its individual strands.\n\nD.

This is evidence that the isolated fragment was undergoing active transcription at the moment of isolation, a process that chemically modifies bases and temporarily invalidates Chargaff's rules.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most accurate explanation for an apparent violation of Chargaff's rules in a 50-base-pair DNA fragment.\n\nFirst, let's state Chargaff's rules. These rules, derived empirically by Erwin Chargaff, describe the base composition of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The two main rules are:\n1. The amount of Adenine (A) is equal to the amount of Thymine (T). ($A = T$)\n2. The amount of Guanine (G) is equal to the amount of Cytosine (C). ($G = C$)\nThese rules are a direct consequence of the fundamental structure of the DNA double helix, where A on one strand always pairs with T on the complementary strand, and G on one strand always pairs with C on the complementary strand. This is known as complementary base pairing.\n\nThe problem provides the base composition for *one of the two strands* of a 50-base-pair dsDNA fragment. Let's call this strand S1.\nThe composition of S1 is:\n- $A_{S1} = 12$\n- $T_{S1} = 13$\n- $G_{S1} = 15$\n- $C_{S1} = 10$\nThe total number of bases in this strand is $12 + 13 + 15 + 10 = 50$, which is consistent with the problem description of a 50-base-pair fragment (implying each strand is 50 bases long). As observed, within this single strand S1, $A_{S1} \\neq T_{S1}$ and $G_{S1} \\neq C_{S1}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the complementary strand, which we will call S2. Due to the rules of base pairing:\n- The number of Adenine bases on S2 ($A_{S2}$) must equal the number of Thymine bases on S1 ($T_{S1}$).\n- The number of Thymine bases on S2 ($T_{S2}$) must equal the number of Adenine bases on S1 ($A_{S1}$).\n- The number of Guanine bases on S2 ($G_{S2}$) must equal the number of Cytosine bases on S1 ($C_{S1}$).\n- The number of Cytosine bases on S2 ($C_{S2}$) must equal the number of Guanine bases on S1 ($G_{S1}$).\n\nUsing the composition of S1, we can determine the composition of S2:\n- $A_{S2} = T_{S1} = 13$\n- $T_{S2} = A_{S1} = 12$\n- $G_{S2} = C_{S1} = 10$\n- $C_{S2} = G_{S1} = 15$\n\nChargaff's rules apply to the entire double-stranded molecule. Let's calculate the total base composition for the complete 50-base-pair fragment by summing the counts from both strands S1 and S2.\n- Total Adenine ($A_{total}$) = $A_{S1} + A_{S2} = 12 + 13 = 25$\n- Total Thymine ($T_{total}$) = $T_{S1} + T_{S2} = 13 + 12 = 25$\n- Total Guanine ($G_{total}$) = $G_{S1} + G_{S2} = 15 + 10 = 25$\n- Total Cytosine ($C_{total}$) = $C_{S1} + C_{S2} = 10 + 15 = 25$\n\nFor the entire double-stranded fragment, we find that $A_{total} = T_{total}$ (25 = 25) and $G_{total} = C_{total}$ (25 = 25). This is in perfect agreement with Chargaff's rules. The initial apparent discrepancy arose because the analysis was performed on only one of the two strands. There is no rule governing the base composition of a single DNA strand, only for the double-stranded molecule as a whole.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options:\n- A is incorrect. The observation is not a violation or an error. It is a predictable consequence of analyzing a single strand.\n- B is incorrect. This is a common misconception. Chargaff's rules are not statistical; they are a direct result of the chemical base-pairing in any dsDNA molecule, regardless of its length.\n- C is correct. It accurately identifies that the rules apply to the double-stranded molecule as a whole and that the data came from a single strand, thus explaining the observation.\n- D is incorrect. While some viruses have single-stranded genomes, the problem states the DNA was isolated from a human chromosome, and it is a double-stranded fragment. There is no information to suggest a viral origin.\n- E is incorrect. While transcription involves a temporary unwinding of DNA, it does not chemically modify the bases in a way that would cause this result, nor does the problem provide any evidence that transcription was occurring. The base pairing rules remain fundamental.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that the analysis of a single strand does not need to, and often will not, conform to Chargaff's rules, which describe the composition of the complete dsDNA molecule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1473996"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise challenges you to synthesize your knowledge of both single-strand complementarity and overall double-helix composition.
