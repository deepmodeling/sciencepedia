Errors in chromosome separation, a process called nondisjunction, are the primary cause of trisomies. This first exercise [@problem_id:1484880] presents a clear scenario to help you trace the precise consequences of a single nondisjunction event during Meiosis II, allowing you to calculate the resulting proportion of abnormal, or aneuploid, gametes.", "problem": "A diploid human germ-line cell, which contains 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes, is set to undergo meiosis to produce four gametes. For the purposes of this problem, let's focus on chromosome 21. The first meiotic division (Meiosis I) proceeds perfectly, resulting in two intermediate cells. Following this, only one of these two intermediate cells experiences a single nondisjunction event during the second meiotic division (Meiosis II), where the sister chromatids of chromosome 21 fail to separate properly. The other intermediate cell completes Meiosis II without any errors.\n\nAneuploidy is defined as the state of possessing an abnormal number of copies of a particular chromosome. Considering all four final gametes produced from this single initial cell, what fraction of them are aneuploid for chromosome 21?\n\nExpress your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes; with perfect Meiosis I, each of the two intermediate cells receives one homolog of chromosome 21, still composed of two sister chromatids.\n\nIn Meiosis II, sister chromatids are supposed to separate. In the intermediate cell that undergoes nondisjunction for chromosome 21, both sister chromatids go to the same pole. This yields two gametes:\n- one gamete with two copies of chromosome 21 (disomic for 21; aneuploid),\n- one gamete with zero copies of chromosome 21 (nullisomic for 21; aneuploid).\n\nIn the other intermediate cell, Meiosis II proceeds normally, yielding two gametes each with exactly one copy of chromosome 21 (euploid for 21).\n\nThus, among the four total gametes, exactly two are aneuploid for chromosome 21.

This practice problem [@problem_id:1484879] uses a hypothetical genetic trait to explore the interplay between dominance, recessiveness, and aneuploidy. Working through it will clarify how gene dosage in a trisomic state affects the final phenotype, explaining why simply inheriting a recessive allele may not be enough for it to be expressed.", "problem": "A rare, harmless metabolic quirk known as Achromatic Taste Perception (ATP) is determined by a single gene located on human chromosome 21. The allele for normal taste perception, denoted as $A$, is completely dominant over the recessive allele $a$, which causes ATP. An individual must have a homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$) to exhibit the ATP trait.\n\nA couple decides to have a child. The father exhibits ATP, and the mother has no family history of the condition and is considered to be homozygous dominant for the trait. Due to a single meiotic nondisjunction event involving chromosome 21 in the mother, they have a child with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Assuming no other genetic anomalies, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected phenotype of the child with respect to ATP and the underlying genetic reason?\n\nA. The child will exhibit ATP because they inherit the recessive allele from the father.\n\nB. The child will not exhibit ATP because the two dominant alleles from the mother will mask the effect of the single recessive allele from the father.\n\nC. The child will not exhibit ATP because the presence of an extra chromosome triggers a silencing mechanism that inactivate all recessive alleles on that chromosome.\n\nD. The child's phenotype for ATP cannot be determined because the aneuploidy caused by trisomy 21 leads to completely unpredictable gene expression.\n\nE. The child will exhibit a mild, intermediate form of ATP due to a gene dosage imbalance between the dominant and recessive alleles.", "solution": "The ATP trait is recessive and requires a homozygous recessive genotype to be expressed. In diploids this is $aa$. In a trisomic individual for chromosome 21, there are three copies of the locus; with complete dominance of $A$ over $a$, the recessive phenotype requires that all copies be recessive, i.e., the zygote must be $aaa$. If at least one $A$ is present among the three alleles, the phenotype is normal taste.\n\nThe father exhibits ATP, so his genotype must be $aa$. Therefore, every sperm he produces carries the allele $a$ at this locus.\n\nThe mother is stated to be homozygous dominant, $AA$. A meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome 21 in the mother produces an ovum carrying two copies of chromosome 21 from her. Because both maternal homologs carry $A$, the ovum’s allelic content at the locus is $AA$.\n\nFertilization combines the maternal $AA$ with the paternal $a$, yielding a trisomic zygote with alleles $AAa$ at the ATP locus. By the principle of complete dominance, the presence of at least one $A$ is sufficient for the normal-taste phenotype; the recessive ATP phenotype requires $aaa$, which is not the case here. Therefore, the child will not exhibit ATP. The correct reasoning is that the two dominant alleles from the mother mask the effect of the single recessive allele from the father.\n\nThus, the accurate statement is that the child will not exhibit ATP because the two dominant alleles from the mother will mask the effect of the single recessive allele from the father, which corresponds to option B. The alternative options are incorrect: A ignores dominance; C proposes a nonexistent global silencing mechanism; D overstates unpredictability for a simple Mendelian locus despite aneuploidy; E incorrectly implies intermediate expression despite complete dominance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1484879"}, {"introduction": "In modern genetics, we can act as molecular detectives to trace the exact origin of a chromosomal abnormality. This final, more advanced practice problem [@problem_id:1484870] demonstrates how real-world genetic data, specifically from Short Tandem Repeat (STR) markers, are used to investigate a case of trisomy 21. By interpreting the distinct patterns of these markers in a family, you can deduce not only the parental origin of the extra chromosome but also the specific meiotic stage—Meiosis I or Meiosis II—in which the error occurred, providing a powerful insight into the mechanisms of human genetics.", "problem": "In a genetic counseling case, a couple has a child diagnosed with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). To understand the origin of the trisomic condition, molecular analysis is performed using three highly polymorphic Short Tandem Repeat (STR) markers located on chromosome 21. It is determined through other tests that the nondisjunction event occurred during maternal oogenesis.\n\nThe physical map of this region of chromosome 21 is known to be:\nCentromere -- D21S11 -- D21S12 -- D21S13\n\nThe genotypes of the mother, father, and the child for these three STR markers are determined. The numbers represent distinct alleles for each marker.\n\n| Marker   | Mother's Genotype | Father's Genotype | Child's Genotype |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| D21S11   | (1, 2)            | (7, 7)            | (1, 1, 7)        |\n| D21S12   | (3, 4)            | (8, 8)            | (3, 4, 8)        |\n| D21S13   | (5, 6)            | (9, 9)            | (5, 6, 9)        |\n\nAssuming the trisomy resulted from a single nondisjunction event during maternal meiosis and that at most one crossover event occurred on this chromosome arm, which of the following statements correctly identifies the meiotic stage of the nondisjunction and the location of the crossover?\n\nA.

Meiosis II nondisjunction; crossover between D21S12 and D21S13.\n\nF. Meiosis I nondisjunction; no crossover occurred.\n\nG. Meiosis II nondisjunction; no crossover occurred.", "solution": "We first restate the marker order on chromosome 21: Centromere -- D21S11 -- D21S12 -- D21S13. The father is homozygous at all three STRs, so the non-paternal (third) allele at each locus in the child must come from the duplicated maternal chromatids. The observed genotypes are:\n- D21S11: mother (1, 2), child (1, 1, 7). The two maternal alleles in the child are both 1 (isodisomy).\n- D21S12: mother (3, 4), child (3, 4, 8). The two maternal alleles in the child are 3 and 4 (heterodisomy).\n- D21S13: mother (5, 6), child (5, 6, 9). The two maternal alleles in the child are 5 and 6 (heterodisomy).\n\nPrinciple relating nondisjunction stage to disomy patterns:\n- In meiosis I nondisjunction (failure of homologs to segregate), the ovum receives two different maternal homologs. Therefore, at loci near the centromere (where no recombination can make sister chromatids differ), the duplicated maternal alleles are typically different (heterodisomy).\n- In meiosis II nondisjunction (failure of sister chromatids to segregate), the ovum receives two sister chromatids from the same homolog. Sister chromatids are identical at and around the centromere, so the duplicated maternal alleles are the same (isodisomy) at centromere-proximal loci. If a crossover occurred in meiosis I between homologs, the two sister chromatids differ distal to the crossover point, yielding heterodisomy distal to the crossover and isodisomy proximal to it.\n\nApply this to the data:\n- At the most centromere-proximal marker D21S11, the child shows maternal isodisomy (both maternal alleles are 1). This pattern at a centromere-proximal locus is diagnostic of meiosis II nondisjunction.\n- At the distal markers D21S12 and D21S13, the child shows maternal heterodisomy (3 and 4; 5 and 6). In meiosis II nondisjunction, this indicates that a crossover occurred in meiosis I between the centromere and the first locus that shows heterodisomy.\n\nLocalizing the crossover:\n- The transition from isodisomy at D21S11 to heterodisomy at D21S12 implies that the single crossover occurred between D21S11 and D21S12. If the crossover had been between D21S12 and D21S13, we would expect isodisomy at D21S12 and a possible change at D21S13, which is not observed. If no crossover had occurred, we would observe isodisomy at all loci, which is contradicted by heterodisomy at D21S12 and D21S13.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is meiosis II nondisjunction with a single crossover between D21S11 and D21S12.
