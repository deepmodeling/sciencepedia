Although an individual heterozygous for an inversion may be phenotypically normal, they often face challenges during meiosis, which can lead to reduced fertility. The consequences of a crossover event within an inverted segment depend critically on whether the centromere is included in the inversion. This practice problem [@problem_id:1475919] challenges you to compare the meiotic outcomes of a single crossover in both a paracentric (para- = beside) and a pericentric (peri- = around) inversion, revealing the distinct types of genetically unbalanced gametes produced in each scenario.", "problem": "An individual organism is heterozygous for a chromosomal inversion. The normal chromosome has the gene order `A-B-C-D-E-F-G`, with the centromere located between genes `B` and `C`. Consider two distinct scenarios for the inversion in the homologous chromosome:\n\nScenario 1 (Paracentric Inversion): The segment containing genes `D-E-F` is inverted, but the centromere is not part of the inverted segment. The gene order for the inverted chromosome is `A-B-C-F-E-D-G`.\n\nScenario 2 (Pericentric Inversion): The segment containing genes `C-D-E` is inverted, and this segment includes the centromere. The gene order for the inverted chromosome is `A-B-E-D-C-F-G`.\n\nDuring meiosis in this heterozygous individual, a single crossover event occurs between genes `D` and `E` within the inversion loop for both scenarios.

Two of these gametes will contain the non-recombinant chromatids (one normal, one inverted), and two will contain the recombinant chromatids.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately compares the genetic makeup of the resulting recombinant chromatids from the single crossover in the two scenarios?\n\nA. In both scenarios, the recombinant chromatids are monocentric but carry duplications of some genes and deletions of others, rendering the resulting gametes non-viable.\n\nB.

In both scenarios, the recombinant products are a dicentric chromosome and an acentric fragment, both of which are lost, leading to only two types of viable gametes being produced.\n\nE. In the paracentric scenario, the recombinant chromatids are genetically balanced and viable. In the pericentric scenario, the recombinant chromatids are genetically unbalanced and non-viable.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must analyze the consequences of a single crossover within an inversion loop for both a paracentric and a pericentric inversion. In both cases, an individual is heterozygous for the inversion, meaning they have one normal chromosome and one inverted chromosome. To allow for gene-by-gene pairing (synapsis) during meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes form a characteristic inversion loop. We will analyze the structure of the four chromatids that result after DNA replication and the specified crossover event.\n\nLet's denote the centromere with 'o'. The normal chromosome's gene order is `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`. (Note: The problem statement located the centromere between B and C. For clarity in drawing out the loop and tracing chromatids, let's represent it this way. The logic remains identical).\n\n**Scenario 1: Paracentric Inversion**\n\nA paracentric inversion is one where the inverted segment does not include the centromere.\nNormal chromosome: `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`\nParacentric inverted chromosome: `A-B-o-C-F-E-D-G` (The `D-E-F` segment is inverted).\n\nDuring prophase I, these chromosomes form an inversion loop. Let's label the chromatids after replication:\nChromatid 1 (Normal): `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`\nChromatid 2 (Normal): `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`\nChromatid 3 (Inverted): `A-B-o-C-F-E-D-G`\nChromatid 4 (Inverted): `A-B-o-C-F-E-D-G`\n\nA single crossover occurs between chromatids 2 and 3 within the inverted region, specifically between genes `D` and `E`. To trace the recombinant products, we follow one chromatid until the crossover point, then switch to the other chromatid.\n\n- The two non-recombinant chromatids are 1 and 4, which will segregate into gametes without modification:\n  - Gamete with Chromatid 1: `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G` (Normal, viable)\n  - Gamete with Chromatid 4: `A-B-o-C-F-E-D-G` (Inverted, viable)\n\n- Now, let's trace the recombinant chromatids resulting from the crossover between 2 and 3:\n  - Recombinant Chromatid A: Follows chromatid 2 until the crossover point, then switches to 3.\n    `A-B-o-C-D` (from 2) + `E-F-C-o-B-A` (from 3, reading 'out' of the loop).\n    The full sequence is `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-C-o-B-A`. This chromatid has two centromeres ('o'), making it a **dicentric chromosome**. During anaphase I, the two centromeres will be pulled to opposite poles, causing the chromosome to break randomly. The resulting products will have major deletions and be non-viable.\n\n  - Recombinant Chromatid B: Follows chromatid 3 until the crossover point, then switches to 2.\n    `G-D` (from 3) + `E-F-G` (from 2, reading 'out' of the loop).\n    The full sequence is `G-D-E-F-G`. This fragment has no centromere, making it an **acentric fragment**. During cell division, it cannot attach to the spindle fibers and will be lost. The resulting gamete is non-viable.\n\nConclusion for Paracentric Inversion: A single crossover results in two viable, non-recombinant gametes and two non-viable gametes containing the products of a dicentric chromosome and an acentric fragment.\n\n**Scenario 2: Pericentric Inversion**\n\nA pericentric inversion is one where the inverted segment includes the centromere.\nNormal chromosome: `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`\nPericentric inverted chromosome: `A-B-E-D-C-o-F-G` (The problem stated inversion of `C-D-E` including the centromere, so using the `A-B-o-C-D...` notation, the inverted segment is `o-C-D-E`, which becomes `E-D-C-o`).\n\nLet's label the chromatids after replication:\nChromatid 1 (Normal): `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`\nChromatid 2 (Normal): `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`\nChromatid 3 (Inverted): `A-B-E-D-C-o-F-G`\nChromatid 4 (Inverted): `A-B-E-D-C-o-F-G`\n\nA single crossover occurs between chromatids 2 and 3 between genes `D` and `E`.\n\n- The two non-recombinant chromatids are 1 and 4, which are viable:\n  - Gamete with Chromatid 1: `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G` (Normal, viable)\n  - Gamete with Chromatid 4: `A-B-E-D-C-o-F-G` (Inverted, viable)\n\n- Now, let's trace the recombinant chromatids resulting from the crossover between 2 and 3:\n  - Recombinant Chromatid A: Follows chromatid 2 until the crossover point, then switches to 3.\n    `A-B-o-C-D` (from 2) + `C-o-F-G` (from 3).\n    The full sequence is `A-B-o-C-D-C-o-F-G`. This is not correct. Let's re-trace carefully following the path through the loop.\n    Recombinant product starts with centromere from chromosome 2: `A-B-o-C-D` then crosses to chromosome 3's path `C-B-A`. The structure is `G-F-o-C-D-E...`. Wait, the re-tracing is best visualized. Let's use the actual genes.\n    Start with chromatid 2's `A` end: `A-B-E-D-` (from 3) `-E-F-G` (from 2). No, that's wrong.\n    Let's trace from the `A` end of chromatid 2: `A-B-o-C-D-` then crosses to chromatid 3, continuing from position `D`: `D-E-B-A`. Result: `A-B-o-C-D-D-E-B-A`. This is not right.\n\n    Let's re-examine the crossover product.\n    A segment from the \"top\" of the loop (chromatid 2) `A-B-o-C-D` combines with a segment from the \"bottom\" of the loop (chromatid 3) `...-C-o-F-G`.\n    Recombinant 1: `A-B-o-C-D` (from 2) + `-C-o-F-G` (from 3, after crossover point). Result sequence: `A-B-o-C-D-C-o-F-G`. This is dicentric. Something is wrong in my tracing or initial setup based on the problem statement.\n\n    Let's use the problem's own chromosome definitions.\n    Normal: `A-B-C-D-E-F-G`, centromere between B and C. `A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`\n    Pericentric: `A-B-E-D-C-F-G`, centromere in inverted segment `E-D-C`. Stays between B and C's new neighbors: B and E. So it's `A-B-o-E-D-C-F-G`.\n\n    Okay, let's trace again with this confirmed structure.\n    Crossover between D and E on the loop between chromatids 2 (`A-B-o-C-D-E-F-G`) and 3 (`A-B-o-E-D-C-F-G`).\n    - Recombinant Chromatid X: starts with 2's centromere `A-B-o-C-D` and switches to 3's arm `C-F-G`. Result: `A-B-o-C-D-C-F-G`. This recombinant chromosome has duplicated gene `C` and deleted gene `E`. It is **monocentric** and genetically unbalanced.\n    - Recombinant Chromatid Y: starts with 3's centromere `A-B-o-E-D` and switches to 2's arm `E-F-G`. Result: `A-B-o-E-D-E-F-G`. This recombinant chromosome has duplicated gene `E` and deleted gene `C`. It is also **monocentric** and genetically unbalanced.\n\n    Both recombinant chromatids contain a single centromere, so they are not acentric or dicentric. However, they both have a gene deletion and a gene duplication, a state known as aneuploidy. Gametes containing these chromosomes are typically non-viable.\n\n**Comparison and Final Conclusion**\n\n- **Paracentric crossover:** Recombinant products are a dicentric chromosome and an acentric fragment.\n- **Pericentric crossover:** Recombinant products are two monocentric chromosomes, but both are genetically unbalanced due to containing both a duplication and a deletion.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n- A: Incorrect. Only the pericentric scenario fits this description.\n- B: Correct. This statement accurately describes the distinct outcomes for both scenarios. The paracentric crossover creates dicentric/acentric products, while the pericentric crossover creates monocentric but unbalanced (duplication/deletion) products.\n- C: Incorrect. This swaps the outcomes of the two scenarios.\n- D: Incorrect. This only describes the paracentric outcome and incorrectly applies it to both.\n- E: Incorrect. The paracentric recombinant chromatids are not viable, contrary to the statement.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate comparison is provided in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1475919"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their role in genetic disease and evolution, chromosomal abnormalities can be powerful tools for geneticists. Reciprocal translocations, where segments are exchanged between non-homologous chromosomes, provide a classic example. When a gene of interest is located on one of the rearranged chromosomes, it will exhibit \"pseudolinkage\" to the translocation. This final exercise [@problem_id:1475922] demonstrates how geneticists can leverage the unique segregation patterns of translocation heterozygotes in a testcross to determine the chromosomal location of a newly discovered gene, illustrating a beautiful intersection of cytogenetics and experimental design.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a newly discovered autosomal recessive mutation, `pale eyes` ($pe$), in a fictional diploid insect, the Crimson Beetle (*Coleoptera sanguinea*). The wild-type allele, $pe^+$, confers the normal crimson eye color. The beetle has four pairs of chromosomes ($2n=8$), which are numbered 1 through 4.\n\nTo determine which chromosome carries the $pe$ gene, the geneticist utilizes a true-breeding stock that is homozygous for a known balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of Chromosome 2 and Chromosome 3. This stock is denoted as `T(2;3)` and has a wild-type crimson eye phenotype.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  A true-breeding beetle with pale eyes and a normal karyotype (no translocation) is crossed with a beetle from the true-breeding `T(2;3)` stock (which has crimson eyes).\n2.  The resulting F1 progeny, all of which exhibit crimson eyes, are then testcrossed to beetles from the original pale-eyed, normal karyotype stock.\n\nThe F1 female meiosis produces gametes that result in viable offspring only when a balanced set of chromosomal material is segregated (a pattern known as alternate segregation). Gametes resulting from other segregation patterns are assumed to produce non-viable embryos.\n\nUpon analyzing a large number of the testcross progeny, the geneticist observes a distinct pattern: all offspring exhibiting pale eyes are found to possess a normal, non-translocated karyotype. Conversely, all offspring exhibiting the wild-type crimson eyes are found to be heterozygous for the `T(2;3)` translocation.\n\nBased on this evidence, what is the most precise conclusion about the chromosomal location of the $pe$ gene?\n\nA. The $pe$ gene is located on Chromosome 1.\nB. The $pe$ gene is located on Chromosome 2.\nC. The $pe$ gene is located on Chromosome 3.\nD. The $pe$ gene is located on either Chromosome 2 or Chromosome 3.\nE. The $pe$ gene is located on Chromosome 4.", "solution": "Define the allele symbols: $pe^+$ is wild type (crimson), $pe$ is recessive (pale). The pale-eyed stock is true-breeding and normal karyotype, so its genotype is $pe/pe$ on all homologs with normal chromosomes. The $T(2;3)$ stock is true-breeding for the balanced reciprocal translocation and has crimson eyes, so its genotype is $pe^+/pe^+$ with both homologs carrying the translocated arrangement for Chromosomes $2$ and $3$.\n\nCross 1 (parental cross): normal $pe/pe$ (no translocation) $\\times$ $pe^+/pe^+$ (homozygous $T(2;3)$).\n- For Chromosomes $2$ and $3$, the F1 are translocation heterozygotes because they receive one normal set $(N2,N3)$ from the normal parent and the two reciprocal translocation derivatives $(T2',T3')$ from the $T(2;3)$ parent, forming the standard quadrivalent at meiosis.\n- For the $pe$ locus, if it lies on Chromosome $2$ or $3$, the alleles in the F1 are in coupling with the karyotype sets: the $pe$ allele resides on the normal homolog(s) $(N2$ or $N3)$ inherited from the pale-eyed parent, and the $pe^+$ allele resides on the translocated homolog(s) $(T2'$ or $T3')$ inherited from the $T(2;3)$ parent. The F1 are $pe^+/pe$ and thus phenotypically crimson, consistent with the observation.\n\nPrinciple of segregation in a translocation heterozygote: At meiosis in the F1, the reciprocal translocation between Chromosomes $2$ and $3$ produces a quadrivalent. Under the stated assumption, only alternate segregation yields balanced gametes that are viable; adjacent segregation products are inviable. The two balanced gamete types from alternate segregation are:\n- The normal set: $(N2+N3)$ together.\n- The translocated set: $(T2'+T3')$ together.\nThese are the only viable gametes contributed by the F1.\n\nTestcross: Each F1 is testcrossed to a pale-eyed, normal karyotype parent $pe/pe$ with $(N2,N3)$.\n- If $pe$ is on Chromosome $2$ or $3$, then:\n  - F1 gamete of type $(N2+N3)$ carries the $pe$ allele (from the pale-eyed normal parent). The zygote receives $pe$ from the F1 and $pe$ from the tester, giving $pe/pe$ (pale). Its karyotype for $2$ and $3$ is normal (both parents contribute normal chromosomes for these), matching the observed class: all pale-eyed offspring are normal karyotype.\n  - F1 gamete of type $(T2'+T3')$ carries the $pe^+$ allele (from the translocation parent). The zygote is $pe^+/pe$ (crimson). Its karyotype for $2$ and $3$ is heterozygous for $T(2;3)$ (inherits translocated derivatives from the F1 and normal from the tester), matching the observed class: all crimson-eyed offspring are $T(2;3)$ heterozygotes.\n\nThus, when the $pe$ locus is on either Chromosome $2$ or $3$, the only viable progeny classes exactly reproduce the observed association: pale phenotype always with a normal karyotype, and crimson phenotype always with translocation heterozygosity.\n\nNow consider the alternative that $pe$ lies on a chromosome not involved in the translocation (Chromosome $1$ or $4$). In that case, the F1 are $pe^+/pe$ on Chromosome $1$ or $4$, and the $pe$ locus segregates independently of the $T(2;3)$ quadrivalent on Chromosomes $2$ and $3$. Among the viable offspring (from alternate segregation), both karyotype classes (normal and $T(2;3)$ heterozygote) would occur with both eye colors because the $pe$ allele assortment would be independent. This contradicts the complete association observed between eye color and $T(2;3)$ karyotype.\n\nTherefore, the data exclude Chromosomes $1$ and $4$ and place $pe$ on a chromosome involved in the $T(2;3)$ translocation. The reciprocal translocation involves both Chromosomes $2$ and $3$, and the observed pattern cannot distinguish whether $pe$ resides on Chromosome $2$ or on Chromosome $3$. Hence the most precise conclusion is that $pe$ is located on either Chromosome $2$ or Chromosome $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1475922"}]}
