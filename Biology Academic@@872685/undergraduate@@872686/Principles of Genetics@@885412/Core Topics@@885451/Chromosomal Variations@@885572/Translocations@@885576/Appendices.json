{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding chromosomal translocations begins with the most basic question: how do they alter the total number of chromosomes in a cell? This exercise focuses on Robertsonian translocations, a common rearrangement where two acrocentric chromosomes fuse, which can have significant implications for fertility. By working through this fundamental problem [@problem_id:1532629], you will practice the simple but crucial skill of determining the somatic chromosome count in a balanced carrier.", "problem": "In human genetics, a normal diploid somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes. Certain chromosomes, known as acrocentric chromosomes, have their centromere located very near one end. In humans, chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 are acrocentric. A Robertsonian translocation is a specific type of chromosomal rearrangement involving the fusion of the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes to form a single, large derivative chromosome. This process typically results in the loss of the short arms, which contain non-essential genetic material, so the carrier remains phenotypically normal.\n\nAn individual is identified as a healthy carrier of a balanced Robertsonian translocation. Cytogenetic analysis confirms that one of their copies of chromosome 14 has fused with one of their copies of chromosome 21. All other chromosomes are normal in number and structure.\n\nWhat is the total number of chromosomes in a single somatic cell of this individual?", "solution": "A normal human diploid somatic cell contains $N_{0} = 46$ chromosomes.\n\nA Robertsonian translocation fuses the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes into a single derivative chromosome and results in the loss of the short arms. Counting principle: two separate chromosomes are replaced by one fused chromosome, so the total chromosome number decreases by one. Hence the net change in chromosome count is\n$$\n\\Delta N = 1 - 2 = -1.\n$$\nIn this case, one chromosome $14$ and one chromosome $21$ fuse. Originally, the cell had two copies each of chromosomes $14$ and $21$, totaling $4$ chromosomes among these two types. After translocation, the cell has one normal $14$, one normal $21$, and one derivative $\\operatorname{der}(14;21)$, totaling $3$ chromosomes among these types. All other chromosomes remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the total chromosome number becomes\n$$\nN = (46 - 4) + 3 = 45,\n$$\nequivalently,\n$$\nN = N_{0} + \\Delta N = 46 - 1 = 45.\n$$\nThus, a healthy carrier of a balanced Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes $14$ and $21$ has $45$ chromosomes in each somatic cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{45}$$", "id": "1532629"}, {"introduction": "While a balanced translocation carrier may be phenotypically normal, the real challenge arises during meiosis, the process of forming gametes. This practice problem [@problem_id:1532694] explores the meiotic segregation of a reciprocal translocation, where homologous pairing leads to a unique cross-shaped structure called a quadrivalent. Mastering the different segregation patterns, such as the adjacent-1 pattern explored here, is essential for predicting the genetic makeup of gametes and understanding the basis of associated fertility issues.", "problem": "An individual human is heterozygous for a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 3 and chromosome 7.

During meiosis, these form a quadrivalent.\n\nKey meiotic segregation patterns for a reciprocal translocation quadrivalent are:\n- Alternate segregation: diagonally opposite centromeres go to the same pole, producing balanced gametes containing either both normal (`N3`, `N7`) or both translocated (`T3`, `T7`).\n- Adjacent-1 segregation: homologous centromeres separate to opposite poles (the usual rule), so the two chromosomes that go to any one pole carry different centromeres (nonhomologous centromeres). This yields one normal chromosome together with the translocated chromosome carrying the other centromere.\n- Adjacent-2 segregation: homologous centromeres go to the same pole (rare), yielding pairs (`N3`, `T3`) and (`N7`, `T7`).\n\nApplying the definition of adjacent-1 segregation to the present case:\n- One pole receives $N3$ (centromere $3$) together with $T7$ (centromere $7$), giving the gametic combination (`N3`, `T7`).\n- The other pole receives $N7$ (centromere $7$) together with $T3$ (centromere $3$), giving the gametic combination (`N7`, `T3`).\n\nThus, adjacent-1 segregation produces the unbalanced gametes (`N3`, `T7`) and (`N7`, `T3`), which corresponds to option B.

Cytogenetic analysis using standard G-banding karyotyping reveals a *de novo* (newly occurring) and apparently balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 2 and chromosome 7, denoted as t(2;7)(q35;q21). To investigate the molecular underpinnings of the patient's condition, high-resolution whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed.\n\nA simplified map of genes in the vicinity of the translocation breakpoints is provided below, with locations given in base pair (bp) coordinates on their respective reference chromosomes:\n\n**Chromosome 2 (GRCh38 reference):**\n- *HAP1* Gene: 215,400,000 bp to 215,450,000 bp\n- *DEV2* Gene: 215,510,000 bp to 215,580,000 bp\n- *REG3* Gene: 215,650,000 bp to 215,700,000 bp\n\n**Chromosome 7 (GRCh38 reference):**\n- *KIN4* Gene: 88,620,000 bp to 88,690,000 bp\n- *STR5* Gene: 88,750,000 bp to 88,790,000 bp\n- *MEM6* Gene: 88,850,000 bp to 88,900,000 bp\n\nThe WGS analysis precisely maps the breakpoints and assesses copy number across the genome. The findings are as follows:\n1.  The breakpoint on chromosome 2 is located at position 215,600,000 bp.\n2.  The breakpoint on chromosome 7 is located at position 88,720,000 bp.\n3.  Analysis of sequencing read depth reveals a normal diploid copy number (2 copies) across the vast majority of the genome. However, it uncovers a single-copy region (a heterozygous deletion) on chromosome 2, spanning from genomic coordinate 215,500,000 bp to 215,600,000 bp. No copy number abnormalities were detected on chromosome 7.\n\nBased on this high-resolution molecular data, which gene is most likely causally implicated in the patient's phenotype?\n\nA. *HAP1*\nB. *DEV2*\nC. *KIN4*\nD. *REG3*\nE. Both *DEV2* and *KIN4*", "solution": "We are given a de novo reciprocal translocation t(2;7)(q35;q21) with whole-genome sequencing defining precise breakpoints and a heterozygous deletion on chromosome 2. To determine which gene is most likely causally implicated, we compare the genomic coordinates of the breakpoints and the detected deletion with the annotated gene intervals.\n\nFirst, analyze chromosome 2. The breakpoint is at 215,600,000 bp, and a heterozygous deletion spans from 215,500,000 bp to 215,600,000 bp. The annotated genes on chromosome 2 have the following intervals:\n- $I_{\\mathrm{HAP1}}=[215{,}400{,}000,\\,215{,}450{,}000]$,\n- $I_{\\mathrm{DEV2}}=[215{,}510{,}000,\\,215{,}580{,}000]$,\n- $I_{\\mathrm{REG3}}=[215{,}650{,}000,\\,215{,}700{,}000]$.\nDefine the deletion interval on chromosome 2 as $D_{\\mathrm{del},2}=[215{,}500{,}000,\\,215{,}600{,}000]$. Then we have\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DEV2}} \\subseteq D_{\\mathrm{del},2},$$\nwhich implies that one copy of the entire *DEV2* gene is deleted (heterozygous loss). In contrast,\n$$I_{\\mathrm{HAP1}} \\cap D_{\\mathrm{del},2}=\\varnothing,$$\nso *HAP1* is not affected by the deletion, and\n$$I_{\\mathrm{REG3}} \\cap D_{\\mathrm{del},2}=\\varnothing,$$\nso *REG3* is not deleted. The chromosome 2 breakpoint at 215,600,000 bp lies between the end of *DEV2* at 215,580,000 bp and the start of *REG3* at 215,650,000 bp, so the breakpoint itself does not disrupt a coding region but the deletion removes *DEV2* entirely on one allele, consistent with haploinsufficiency as a plausible mechanism for the phenotype.\n\nNext, analyze chromosome 7. The breakpoint is at 88,720,000 bp, with no copy number change detected. The annotated genes have intervals:\n- $I_{\\mathrm{KIN4}}=[88{,}620{,}000,\\,88{,}690{,}000]$,\n- $I_{\\mathrm{STR5}}=[88{,}750{,}000,\\,88{,}790{,}000]$,\n- $I_{\\mathrm{MEM6}}=[88{,}850{,}000,\\,88{,}900{,}000]$.\nThe breakpoint at 88,720,000 bp lies in the intergenic region between *KIN4* and *STR5*:\n$$\\max(I_{\\mathrm{KIN4}})=88{,}690{,}000 < 88{,}720{,}000 < \\min(I_{\\mathrm{STR5}})=88{,}750{,}000.$$\nNo copy number abnormality is present on chromosome 7, and there is no evidence that *KIN4* is disrupted by the breakpoint. Therefore, *KIN4* is unlikely to be the causal gene based on these data.\n\nGiven that the only gene with definitive structural impact is *DEV2*, which is completely encompassed by a heterozygous deletion, the gene most likely causally implicated in the patient’s phenotype is *DEV2*.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1532689"}]}
