The messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript for this enzyme specifies a protein that is $L=500$ amino acids long. The process of translation is dynamic, with the ribosome's speed depending on the specific codon it is reading.\n\nFor the vast majority of codons, the time required for the ribosome to decode the codon, catalyze peptide bond formation, and translocate to the next position is a uniform $t_{step} = 50$ milliseconds. However, the decoding time for any given codon 'c' is also dependent on the availability of its corresponding charged transfer RNA (tRNA). A more accurate model for the total time a ribosome stalls at a codon 'c', $t_c$, is given by:\n$$t_c = t_{step} + \\frac{A}{[\\text{tRNA}_c]}$$\nwhere $[\\text{tRNA}_c]$ is the intracellular concentration of the specific charged tRNA that recognizes codon 'c', and $A$ is a biophysical constant representing the search and binding kinetics, with a value of $A = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ M}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n\nIn the wild-type (non-mutated) version of the bacterium, the gene for this enzyme contains a single codon for the amino acid alanine, which is GCG. The intracellular concentration of the corresponding charged tRNA that recognizes GCG is $[\\text{tRNA}_{\\text{GCG}}] = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$.\n\nA single, spontaneous point mutation occurs in the gene, changing this alanine codon from GCG to GCA. This is a synonymous mutation, meaning the amino acid sequence of the resulting enzyme is identical to the wild-type.
