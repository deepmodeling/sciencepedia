This exercise delves into the mechanics of codon recognition, focusing on the 'wobble' hypothesis.

This pairing occurs in an antiparallel fashion. The first two positions of the codon pair with the last two positions of the anticodon according to standard Watson-Crick base pairing rules (A with U, G with C). However, the pairing between the third position of the codon (at the 3' end) and the first position of the anticodon (at the 5' end) is less strict, a phenomenon known as \"wobble.\"\n\nA special modified base, inosine (I), is sometimes found at the first position of the tRNA anticodon. Due to its unique structure, inosine at this \"wobble\" position can form hydrogen bonds with adenine (A), cytosine (C), or uracil (U) on the mRNA codon. It cannot pair with guanine (G).\n\nGiven a tRNA molecule with the anticodon `5'-IGU-3'`, identify all the possible mRNA codons it can recognize from the list below.\n\nA. `5'-ACA-3'`\n\nB. `5'-ACG-3'`\n\nC. `5'-ACU-3'`\n\nD. `5'-ACC-3'`\n\nE. `5'-GCA-3'`\n\nF. `5'-UCA-3'`\n\nSelect all the correct options.", "solution": "The codon-anticodon interaction is antiparallel, with strict Watson-Crick pairing at codon positions 1 and 2 (5' to 3') to anticodon positions 3 and 2 (3' to 5'), and wobble pairing at codon position 3 to anticodon position 1.\n\nLet the mRNA codon be written as $5'$-$b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}$-$3'$. The given anticodon is $5'$-IGU-$3'$, which, when written antiparallel for base pairing, is $3'$-UGI-$5'$.\n\nApplying pairing rules:\n- At codon position $1$, $b_{1}$ pairs with anticodon U (strict), so $b_{1}=A$.\n- At codon position $2$, $b_{2}$ pairs with anticodon G (strict), so $b_{2}=C$.\n- At codon position $3$, $b_{3}$ pairs with anticodon I (wobble), and inosine pairs with $A$, $C$, or $U$, but not $G$, so $b_{3}\\in\\{A,C,U\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the recognized codons are $5'$-ACA-$3'$, $5'$-ACC-$3'$, and $5'$-ACU-$3'$.

This practice explores the remarkable fidelity of this process, which often involves a proofreading step to remove incorrectly attached amino acids. By examining a hypothetical scenario where this editing function is lost, you will uncover the critical role of synthetase proofreading in preventing widespread errors in protein synthesis [@problem_id:1523884].", "problem": "The fidelity of protein synthesis is critically dependent on the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). These enzymes perform a two-step function: first, they catalyze the attachment of a specific amino acid to its corresponding set of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules (a process called tRNA charging), and second, many possess a proofreading mechanism to correct errors.\n\nA researcher is studying a mutant strain of bacteria that has a specific genetic defect in the gene encoding Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS). This enzyme is responsible for charging tRNA molecules that have an anticodon corresponding to Isoleucine (abbreviated tRNA^Ile) with the amino acid Isoleucine (Ile). The mutation completely inactivates the hydrolytic editing domain of the IleRS enzyme but leaves the primary amino acid activation and tRNA-binding/charging domains functionally intact.\n\nThe amino acid Valine (Val) is structurally very similar to Isoleucine, differing only by a single methyl group, and can occasionally be activated and mistakenly attached to tRNA^Ile by the synthetic active site of a normal IleRS enzyme.\n\nGiven this specific mutation, what is the most likely and immediate consequence on the process of translation in these bacteria?\n\nA. tRNA^Ile molecules will frequently be charged with Valine instead of Isoleucine, and this incorrect Valine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where Isoleucine is coded.\n\nB. The IleRS enzyme will be completely unable to bind to or charge any tRNA^Ile molecules, halting the synthesis of all proteins containing Isoleucine.\n\nC. The ribosome will recognize the mischarged Val-tRNA^Ile complex and reject it during the elongation phase of translation, thus preserving protein accuracy at the cost of translation speed.\n\nD. The cell will rapidly upregulate the expression of a different synthetase to compensate for the defective IleRS, leading to no significant change in the final protein sequences.\n\nE. The synthetic active site of the mutated IleRS will lose its specificity, causing tRNA^Ile molecules to be charged with a wide variety of random amino acids from the cytoplasm.", "solution": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases achieve fidelity by a two-tier mechanism: a synthetic (activation) site that selects the correct amino acid and an editing (hydrolytic) site that removes near-cognate amino acids that pass the first sieve. For IleRS, the synthetic site preferentially activates Isoleucine, but due to the close structural similarity of Valine and Isoleucine, Valine can occasionally be misactivated and even transferred to tRNA^{Ile}. The hydrolytic editing domain performs pre-transfer and post-transfer editing to hydrolyze Val-AMP and Val-tRNA^{Ile}, respectively, thereby preventing misincorporation.\n\nIn the described mutant, the hydrolytic editing domain is completely inactivated while the activation and tRNA charging functions remain intact. Therefore, the baseline rate of Valine misactivation by the synthetic site persists, but the essential corrective pathway is lost. As a result, Val-tRNA^{Ile} accumulates.\n\nDuring translation, the ribosome monitors codon-anticodon base pairing in the decoding center and does not directly verify the identity of the attached amino acid. Elongation factor and ribosomal checkpoints are largely blind to the amino acid moiety itself; thus, a correctly paired anticodon on tRNA^{Ile} will be accepted at Ile codons regardless of whether the attached amino acid is Isoleucine or Valine. Consequently, Valine attached to tRNA^{Ile} will be delivered to the A site at Ile codons and incorporated into the growing polypeptide in place of Isoleucine.\n\nTherefore, the immediate and most likely consequence is increased mistranslation specifically at Ile codons by incorporation of Valine due to loss of IleRS editing, consistent with option A. Options B and E contradict the stated retention of activation and charging specificity; option C is incorrect because the ribosome does not proofread the amino acid; option D is incorrect because there is no alternative synthetase that can compensate for IleRS specificity in a way that preserves accurate Ile incorporation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1523884"}, {"introduction": "Moving from individual molecules to a systems-level view, this final practice connects tRNA biology to gene expression and synthetic biology. Cells exhibit 'codon usage bias,' preferentially using certain codons over others, and the cellular pool of tRNAs often reflects this bias to optimize translational efficiency. This problem asks you to quantify the balance between codon demand and tRNA supply, providing insight into how scientists can engineer organisms for maximal protein production [@problem_id:1523894].", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, a key principle for optimizing protein production is ensuring that the cellular supply of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules matches the demand dictated by codon usage in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts of highly expressed genes. This concept is often referred to as the \"codon adaptation hypothesis.\"\n\nConsider a genetically engineered bacterium, *Synthetomonas mobilis*, designed for the high-yield production of a specific protein. To assess the translational efficiency for a particular amino acid, Leucine (Leu), a quantitative metric called the Codon-tRNA Balance Index (CTBI) has been proposed. The CTBI is calculated for a single amino acid by summing the contributions of all its corresponding codons. The contribution of each codon is the product of its relative usage frequency in the target gene(s) and the cellular concentration of the specific tRNA species that decodes it.\n\nThe CTBI is formally defined as:\n$$ \\text{CTBI} = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\text{codons for the amino acid}\\}} (f_i \\times S_i) $$\nwhere $f_i$ is the relative frequency of codon $i$, and $S_i$ is the concentration of the tRNA supply for codon $i$. If a single tRNA species can decode multiple codons (due to wobble pairing), its full concentration is considered the available supply ($S_i$) for each of those codons.\n\nAn analysis of the highly expressed genes in *S. mobilis* reveals the following relative frequencies for the six codons specifying Leucine:\n- CUG: 0.60\n- CUC: 0.15\n- CUU: 0.10\n- UUG: 0.06\n- CUA: 0.05\n- UUA: 0.04\n\nThe cell maintains a pool of three major isoaccepting tRNAs for Leucine.
