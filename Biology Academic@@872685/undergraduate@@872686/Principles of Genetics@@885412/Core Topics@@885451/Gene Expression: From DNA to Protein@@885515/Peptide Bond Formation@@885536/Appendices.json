By understanding the direct quantitative relationship between the length of a messenger RNA's coding sequence and the number of amino acids in the resulting polypeptide, we can appreciate the precision of the genetic code. This practice will sharpen your ability to convert genetic information into structural data about the final protein product [@problem_id:1508507].", "problem": "In a cellular process, a mature messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) molecule is being translated into a polypeptide chain. The coding sequence of this mRNA, defined as the region stretching from the first nucleotide of the start codon to the last nucleotide of the stop codon, inclusive, is found to be 453 nucleotides long. Assuming the standard genetic code where translation initiates at the start codon and terminates at the stop codon, calculate the total number of peptide bonds that will be present in the final, complete polypeptide synthesized from this mRNA.", "solution": "Let the coding sequence length be $L=453$ nucleotides. Translation reads the coding region in triplets (codons), so the total number of codons is\n$$\nN_{c}=\\frac{L}{3}=\\frac{453}{3}=151.\n$$\nUnder the standard genetic code, one of these codons is a stop codon that does not encode an amino acid, while the start codon does encode one amino acid. Therefore, the number of amino acids in the completed polypeptide is\n$$\nN_{a}=N_{c}-1=151-1=150.\n$$\nIn a linear polypeptide, each peptide bond links two adjacent amino acids, so the number of peptide bonds equals the number of amino acids minus one:\n$$\nN_{p}=N_{a}-1=150-1=149.\n$$\nThus, the final polypeptide contains $149$ peptide bonds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{149}$$", "id": "1508507"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple stoichiometry, this next problem challenges our understanding of the essential components for protein synthesis through a thought experiment. It probes the critical first steps of translation, forcing us to consider what happens when a key ingredient—the charged transfer RNA—is missing. This exercise highlights that building a protein is not just about having the blueprints (mRNA) and the factory (ribosome), but also about having the correctly prepared building materials ready for the very first step [@problem_id:1508524].", "problem": "An experiment is conducted using a cell-free translation system. The system contains an abundance of functional ribosomes, a specific Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) molecule encoding a polypeptide, all necessary protein-based initiation and elongation factors, and a plentiful supply of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The provided mRNA molecule includes a standard AUG start codon and a downstream stop codon. However, due to a critical error in preparation, the system is entirely devoid of any \"charged\" Transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA) molecules. This means that while uncharged tRNA molecules are present, none are covalently bonded to their corresponding amino acids.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the state of the system after all components are mixed and incubated under optimal conditions for protein synthesis?\n\nA. The ribosome will fail to assemble correctly on the mRNA start codon, and no part of the polypeptide will be synthesized.\n\nB. The ribosome will assemble at the start codon and traverse the entire length of the mRNA to the stop codon, but no polypeptide will be synthesized.\n\nC. The first amino acid, methionine, will be incorporated, but the ribosome will stall immediately, unable to form the first peptide bond.\n\nD. A random, nonsensical polypeptide will be synthesized as the ribosome incorporates free-floating amino acids from the solution that happen to diffuse into its active site.\n\nE. The mRNA will be rapidly degraded because the lack of translating ribosomes marks it as non-functional for cellular quality control machinery.", "solution": "The essential mechanistic requirement for translation initiation in both bacteria and eukaryotes is the presence of an aminoacylated initiator tRNA. In bacteria, IF2–GTP specifically binds fMet–tRNA\\textsuperscript{fMet} and delivers it to the P site of the small subunit positioned at the AUG start codon; in eukaryotes, eIF2–GTP forms a ternary complex with Met–tRNA\\textsuperscript{i} that is indispensable for 43S preinitiation complex formation and start codon recognition. In either case, the initiator tRNA must be charged with methionine (or formyl-methionine in bacteria). Without a charged initiator tRNA, the ternary complex cannot form, the start codon cannot be properly engaged in the P site, and large-subunit joining via IF2 (or eIF5B)–dependent GTP hydrolysis cannot be triggered. Therefore, the functional 70S or 80S initiation complex fails to assemble.\n\nGiven the system has no charged tRNAs at all, several consequences follow:\n- Initiation fails at the earliest step because the initiator tRNA is uncharged and cannot be used by IF2/eIF2. Thus, no methionine can be placed in the P site and no peptide bond formation can occur at any stage.\n- Elongation is also impossible: EF-Tu/eEF1A deliver only aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A site, which are absent. Even if a small subunit transiently interacts with the mRNA, productive initiation and subsequent translocation cannot occur without aminoacyl-tRNAs.\n- The ribosome cannot “traverse” the mRNA to the stop codon without cycles of decoding, peptidyl transfer, and translocation, each of which requires aminoacyl-tRNAs.\n- Ribosomes cannot use free amino acids directly; peptide bond formation in the peptidyl transferase center requires an aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site. Random incorporation from free amino acids does not occur.\n- In a cell-free system optimized for translation, rapid mRNA degradation by cellular quality-control pathways is not the defining outcome; the immediate mechanistic block is failure to initiate translation due to the absence of charged tRNAs.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate outcome is that the ribosome fails to assemble correctly on the start codon and no part of the polypeptide is synthesized.\n\nOption A is correct; B, C, D, and E are inconsistent with the mechanistic requirements of translation initiation and elongation in the absence of charged tRNAs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1508524"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into the sophisticated biochemistry of the ribosome's active site. Not all amino acids are incorporated with equal ease, and this problem explores how the unique chemical structure of a single amino acid can impact the very rate of peptide bond formation. By examining the special case of proline, we can appreciate how subtle differences in molecular geometry affect the kinetic efficiency of the entire process of polypeptide elongation [@problem_id:1508551].", "problem": "During an investigation into the biosynthesis of a bacterial enzyme, researchers isolate a mutant strain. This mutant strain produces the full-length, but non-functional, enzyme at a significantly slower rate compared to the wild-type strain. Further analysis shows that the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription and the efficiency of transfer RNA (tRNA) charging are normal in the mutant. Protein sequencing reveals that the altered phenotype is due to a single missense mutation, which resulted in the substitution of a Valine residue in the wild-type protein.\n\nGiven that the fundamental catalytic machinery of the ribosome is unchanged and all necessary aminoacyl-tRNAs are available, which one of the following amino acid substitutions for Valine is the most likely cause for the observed significant decrease in the *rate* of polypeptide chain elongation?\n\nA. Valine to Alanine\n\nB. Valine to Leucine\n\nC. Valine to Isoleucine\n\nD. Valine to Proline\n\nE. Valine to Methionine", "solution": "The observation that the mutant strain produces a full-length but non-functional protein at a significantly slower rate, with normal mRNA transcription and normal tRNA charging, rules out defects in transcription and aminoacylation. The fundamental catalytic machinery of the ribosome is unchanged, and all necessary aminoacyl-tRNAs are available, so the cause must be an effect of the specific amino acid substitution on the kinetics of peptide bond formation during elongation.\n\nPeptide bond formation at the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center proceeds by nucleophilic attack of the $\\alpha$-amino group of the A-site aminoacyl-tRNA on the carbonyl carbon of the peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site, forming the peptide bond and transferring the growing polypeptide to the A-site tRNA. The rate of this step depends, among other factors, on the nucleophilicity and geometry of the attacking $\\alpha$-amino group and the conformational constraints imposed by the side chain and backbone.\n\nProline is unique among the standard amino acids because it possesses a secondary amine (an imino acid), in which the $\\alpha$-amino nitrogen is part of a pyrrolidine ring. This secondary amine is less nucleophilic than a primary amine, making peptide bond formation intrinsically slower when proline resides in the A-site. Moreover, proline imposes rigid conformational constraints on the nascent chain, which can slow accommodation and peptide bond formation. In bacteria, this kinetic difficulty is sufficiently pronounced that elongation factor P (EF-P) is specifically required to alleviate ribosome stalling, especially at polyproline sequences; however, even single proline incorporations are known to be among the slowest peptide bond formation events relative to other amino acids.\n\nBy contrast, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, and methionine all have primary $\\alpha$-amino groups and hydrophobic side chains, and their incorporation rates are not uniquely slow relative to valine. These substitutions would be unlikely to cause a significant global decrease in elongation rate. While such substitutions could affect protein folding or function, they do not typically impede the chemical step of peptidyl transfer.\n\nTherefore, the substitution most likely to cause a significant decrease in the rate of polypeptide chain elongation is valine to proline.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1508551"}]}
