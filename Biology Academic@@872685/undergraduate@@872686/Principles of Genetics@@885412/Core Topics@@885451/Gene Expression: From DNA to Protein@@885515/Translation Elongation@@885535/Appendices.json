This process relies on the specific, complementary base pairing between the messenger RNA (mRNA) codon in the ribosome's A site and the anticodon of an incoming transfer RNA (tRNA). This first practice problem provides a foundational check of your understanding of these Watson-Crick pairing rules and the genetic code itself.", "problem": "During an *in vitro* study of translation elongation, a researcher uses ribosomal profiling to determine the precise location of a ribosome on a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The analysis reveals that the codon currently positioned in the aminoacyl (A) site of the ribosome is 5'-CGA-3'. A pool of charged transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules is available in the system.\n\nYour task is to determine which tRNA will be recruited to the A site and the amino acid it carries. The anticodon of the tRNA must be written in the standard 5' to 3' orientation. Use the provided standard genetic code table to identify the amino acid.\n\n**Standard Genetic Code (Codon -> Amino Acid):**\n*   **Alanine (Ala):** GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG\n*   **Arginine (Arg):** CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG\n*   **Asparagine (Asn):** AAU, AAC\n*   **Aspartic Acid (Asp):** GAU, GAC\n*   **Cysteine (Cys):** UGU, UGC\n*   **Glutamic Acid (Glu):** GAA, GAG\n*   **Glutamine (Gln):** CAA, CAG\n*   **Glycine (Gly):** GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG\n*   **Histidine (His):** CAU, CAC\n*   **Isoleucine (Ile):** AUU, AUC, AUA\n*   **Leucine (Leu):** UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG\n*   **Lysine (Lys):** AAA, AAG\n*   **Methionine (Met):** AUG\n*   **Phenylalanine (Phe):** UUU, UUC\n*   **Proline (Pro):** CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG\n*   **Serine (Ser):** UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC\n*   **Threonine (Thr):** ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG\n*   **Tryptophan (Trp):** UGG\n*   **Tyrosine (Tyr):** UAU, UAC\n*   **Valine (Val):** GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG\n*   **STOP:** UAA, UAG, UGA\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the tRNA anticodon and the corresponding amino acid?\n\nA.

Anticodon: 5'-GCU-3'; Amino Acid: Alanine", "solution": "The codon in the A site is 5'-CGA-3'. The tRNA anticodon must pair with this codon by Watson-Crick base pairing and in antiparallel orientation. Using the base-pairing rules (C pairs with G, G pairs with C, A pairs with U), the anticodon sequence that pairs with 5'-CGA-3' is written antiparallel as 3'-GCU-5'. To express the anticodon in the required 5' to 3' orientation, reverse this sequence to obtain 5'-UCG-3'.\n\nNext, identify the amino acid encoded by the codon CGA using the standard genetic code. The codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG all encode arginine. Therefore, the tRNA with anticodon 5'-UCG-3' carries arginine.\n\nComparing with the options, the correct match is the tRNA anticodon 5'-UCG-3' with the amino acid arginine. Note: The original option D was correct, and option C contained a typo (`5'-TCG-3'`). We have corrected the typo, making option C also appear correct. In a typical multiple-choice question, there would be only one correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1531712"}, {"introduction": "The elongation cycle is not a passive process; it is an active, energy-dependent mechanism driven by molecular machines called elongation factors. This exercise [@problem_id:2346160] presents a hypothetical scenario involving a malfunctioning Elongation Factor G (EF-G) to probe the critical link between chemical energy release from GTP hydrolysis and the mechanical work of translocation. By considering what happens when these two functions are uncoupled, you can gain a deeper appreciation for the elegant mechanochemistry of the ribosome.", "problem": "In prokaryotic protein synthesis, the elongation cycle involves the stepwise addition of amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain. A key step in this cycle is translocation, which is facilitated by Elongation Factor G (EF-G), a protein that functions as a GTPase. After peptide bond formation, EF-G binds to the ribosome, hydrolyzes a molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to GDP, and undergoes a significant conformational change. This change is responsible for moving the messenger RNA (mRNA) and its associated transfer RNAs (tRNAs) through the ribosome, shifting the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site and the deacylated tRNA from the P-site to the E-site.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a specific mutation occurs in the gene encoding EF-G. This mutant EF-G protein is still able to bind to the pre-translocation ribosome and hydrolyze GTP. However, the energy from GTP hydrolysis is uncoupled from its mechanical function; the mutation prevents the protein from undergoing the large-scale conformational change required for translocation. Which of the following statements describes the most immediate and direct consequence of this specific mutation on a ribosome actively translating a polypeptide?\n\nA. The ribosome will become permanently stalled with the mutant EF-G-GDP complex and the tRNAs locked in their pre-translocation positions.\n\nB. EF-G will hydrolyze GTP and then immediately dissociate from the ribosome, leaving the tRNAs in their pre-translocation state and allowing translation to terminate prematurely.\n\nC. The deacylated tRNA in the P-site will be ejected, but the peptidyl-tRNA will fail to move from the A-site to the P-site.\n\nD. The process of peptide bond formation between the amino acid in the A-site and the growing polypeptide chain in the P-site will be inhibited.\n\nE. Translocation will proceed, but at a significantly reduced rate, leading to a general slowdown of protein synthesis rather than a complete halt.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the normal, ordered steps of the elongation translocation phase in prokaryotic translation. After peptide bond formation, the ribosome is in a pre-translocation state with peptidyl-tRNA in the A site and deacylated tRNA in the P site. EF-G in its GTP-bound form binds to this ribosome, hydrolyzes GTP, undergoes a large conformational change, and uses the free energy from hydrolysis to perform mechanical work that moves the mRNA and both tRNAs by one codon: the peptidyl-tRNA moves from A to P, and the deacylated tRNA moves from P to E. After this translocation step, EF-G in the GDP-bound form dissociates.\n\nFormally, the chemical step is:\n$$\n\\text{EF-G}\\cdot \\text{GTP} \\to \\text{EF-G}\\cdot \\text{GDP} + P_{i},\n$$\nwith a free energy change $\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}<0$. In the normal mechanism, this chemical free energy is coupled to a conformational change of EF-G and coordinated ribosomal rearrangements that produce mechanical work $W$ to translate the tRNAs and mRNA:\n$$\nW \\leq -\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}.\n$$\nCoupling implies the conformational change is both necessary and sufficient to convert chemical energy into directed mechanical movement.\n\nIn the hypothetical mutant, EF-G still binds to the pre-translocation ribosome and hydrolyzes GTP, but the mutation prevents the large-scale conformational change required for translocation. Therefore, by definition of uncoupling, the hydrolysis occurs without productive mechanical output:\n$$\nW \\approx 0 \\quad \\text{despite} \\quad \\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}<0,\n$$\nso the tRNAs and mRNA do not move; they remain in the pre-translocation positions.\n\nNext, we assess the fate of EF-G on the ribosome. In the canonical cycle, EF-G\\cdotGDP dissociation is favored after the translocation conformational changes have taken place and the ribosome reaches the post-translocation state. If the mutation blocks the conformational change, the structural transitions that both drive translocation and promote EF-G\\cdotGDP release are not achieved. Thus, EF-G binds, hydrolyzes GTP, but cannot execute the conformational rearrangements needed for both translocation and normal dissociation. The most immediate and direct consequence is a stalled complex with EF-G\\cdotGDP still engaged and the tRNAs locked in the pre-translocation state.\n\nNow we eliminate the incorrect alternatives:\n- Option D is incorrect because peptide bond formation is catalyzed by the peptidyl transferase center and occurs prior to EF-G action; the mutation does not affect this step.\n- Option C is incorrect because ejection of the deacylated tRNA from the P site into the E site requires coordinated translocation; without the conformational change, such selective ejection without A-to-P movement is not supported by the mechanism.\n- Option E is incorrect because the mutation prevents the required conformational change, so the process does not merely slow; it fails to proceed in that cycle, causing a stall rather than a reduced-rate translocation.\n- Option B is incorrect because EF-G\\cdotGDP typically dissociates after successful translocation; immediate dissociation without effect is unlikely when the conformational transitions are blocked. Moreover, failure to translocate does not cause termination; instead, the ribosome stalls with the A site occupied by peptidyl-tRNA and the P site by deacylated tRNA, preventing further elongation.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct consequence is a stalled pre-translocation complex with EF-G\\cdotGDP remaining bound and tRNAs locked in place, consistent with option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346160"}, {"introduction": "To maximize protein production, cells employ a strategy of simultaneous translation, where multiple ribosomes work on the same mRNA molecule to form a polysome.

The rate of elongation for any given ribosome is constant at 15 amino acids per second. Multiple ribosomes can simultaneously translate the same mRNA molecule, forming a structure known as a polysome.
