{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The concept of protein targeting hinges on the existence of specific \"address labels\" or signal sequences that direct a protein to its correct cellular location. This first practice explores the fundamental principle of signal sequence sufficiency. By considering a hypothetical genetic fusion, you will test the idea that a targeting signal is a modular and transferable unit capable of redirecting a protein that would otherwise remain in the cytosol [@problem_id:1515383].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying protein localization in a eukaryotic cell line. They focus on two proteins: Protein A, an enzyme that is normally found and functions in the cytosol, and Protein B, a component of the electron transport chain that resides within the mitochondrial matrix. Genetic analysis reveals that Protein A lacks any N-terminal or C-terminal targeting signals. In contrast, Protein B has a specific N-terminal amino acid sequence that acts as a mitochondrial targeting signal.\n\nThe biologist performs a genetic engineering experiment to create a new fusion gene. This fusion gene consists of the DNA sequence encoding the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal from Protein B, ligated directly to the full coding sequence of Protein A. This new gene is then introduced into the eukaryotic cells, where it is successfully transcribed and translated.\n\nAssuming the fusion protein folds correctly and the targeting signal remains functional, in which cellular compartment would you predominantly expect to find the newly synthesized fusion protein?\n\nA. In the cytosol\n\nB. In the nucleus\n\nC. Secreted outside the cell\n\nD. In the mitochondrial matrix\n\nE. In the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum", "solution": "The problem asks where a fusion protein will localize when an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) from a known mitochondrial matrix protein (Protein B) is fused to a normally cytosolic protein (Protein A), assuming correct folding and a functional targeting signal.\n\nRelevant cell biological principles:\n1) Default localization: In the absence of any targeting signal, nuclear-encoded proteins synthesized on free ribosomes remain in the cytosol. Protein A lacks targeting signals in its native form and therefore is normally cytosolic.\n2) Mitochondrial targeting presequences: Proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix typically contain an N-terminal, positively charged, amphipathic helix (the MTS). This presequence is recognized post-translationally by receptors on the mitochondrial outer membrane (e.g., TOM complex).\n3) Import pathway to the matrix: The MTS directs the protein through the TOM complex across the outer membrane and then through the TIM23 complex across the inner membrane. Translocation is driven by the membrane potential across the inner membrane and ATP-dependent chaperones. Once in the matrix, the MTS is usually cleaved by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, yielding the mature protein localized in the matrix.\n4) Specificity of other pathways:\n- Nuclear localization requires a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is not provided by a mitochondrial presequence.\n- Entry into the secretory pathway and the endoplasmic reticulum lumen requires an N-terminal signal peptide recognized by the signal recognition particle and the Sec61 translocon; a mitochondrial presequence does not serve this role.\n- Secretion outside the cell proceeds via the ER-Golgi pathway and likewise requires an ER signal peptide.\n\nApplication to the fusion:\n- The fusion places the N-terminal MTS of Protein B at the N-terminus of Protein A. This positioning is critical because mitochondrial presequences function at the N-terminus.\n- Protein A is a soluble cytosolic enzyme without membrane-spanning segments; adding only an MTS and no additional hydrophobic stop-transfer domains will target it for complete translocation into the mitochondrial matrix rather than integration into membranes or retention in the intermembrane space.\n- Therefore, the functional MTS is sufficient to reroute the fusion protein from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nThus, the newly synthesized fusion protein would predominantly localize to the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nElimination of options:\n- A (cytosol): Incorrect, because the added MTS redirects import to mitochondria.\n- B (nucleus): Incorrect, no NLS present.\n- C (secreted): Incorrect, no ER signal peptide; mitochondrial presequences are not recognized by SRP.\n- D (mitochondrial matrix): Correct, fits the import mechanism for N-terminal presequences without stop-transfer segments.\n- E (ER lumen): Incorrect, requires an ER signal peptide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1515383"}, {"introduction": "While some proteins are fully translocated into an organelle, many must be precisely embedded within a membrane.

The gene for MP-7 is designed to encode a single polypeptide chain with the following features in order from the N-terminus to the C-terminus:\n\n1.  An N-terminal signal sequence, which directs the protein to the ER and is subsequently cleaved by signal peptidase in the ER lumen.\n2.  A region of the polypeptide chain designated as Loop 1.\n3.  An internal, hydrophobic stop-transfer anchor sequence.

A double-pass protein with its N-terminus in the cytosol and its C-terminus in the ER lumen.", "solution": "The final topology of the mature MP-7 protein is determined by the sequential action of its signal sequences during co-translational translocation into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) membrane. Let's trace this process step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initiation of Translocation:** Protein synthesis begins on a free ribosome in the cytosol. As the N-terminus of the polypeptide emerges, the N-terminal signal sequence is exposed. This sequence is recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), which temporarily halts translation and targets the entire ribosome-mRNA-polypeptide complex to the ER membrane. The complex docks with the translocon (Sec61 channel).\n\n2.  **First Translocation and Cleavage:** Translation resumes, and the polypeptide chain is threaded through the translocon into the ER lumen, N-terminus first. The N-terminal signal sequence enters the lumen and is cleaved by signal peptidase. This cleavage event releases the original N-terminus. The portion of the protein immediately following the cleavage site becomes the new, mature N-terminus. This mature N-terminus is now located inside the ER lumen.\n\n3.  **Action of the Stop-Transfer Sequence:** Translation continues, and the polypeptide chain, including the region \"Loop 1\", is fed into the ER lumen. When the internal, hydrophobic stop-transfer anchor sequence is synthesized and enters the translocon, it acts as a halt signal. The translocon channel closes, and the stop-transfer sequence slides laterally out of the channel to become embedded in the lipid bilayer as the first transmembrane helix. This event halts the translocation process.\n\n4.  **Cytosolic Synthesis:** With translocation stopped, the ribosome (which is still attached to the outside of the translocon) continues to synthesize the remainder of the protein. The portion of the polypeptide immediately C-terminal to the stop-transfer sequence, which is \"Loop 2\", is synthesized into the cytosol.\n\n5.  **Action of the Start-Transfer Sequence:** Synthesis proceeds in the cytosol until the internal, hydrophobic start-transfer sequence is produced. This sequence functions as a new signal peptide. It directs the ribosome and the polypeptide chain to a new or the same translocon and initiates a second round of translocation. The start-transfer sequence itself inserts into the membrane, becoming the second transmembrane helix. The portion of the polypeptide C-terminal to this sequence is threaded through the translocon into the ER lumen.\n\n6.  **Completion of Synthesis:** The final C-terminal region of the protein is synthesized and translocated completely into the ER lumen. Translation terminates, the ribosome dissociates, and the C-terminus of the mature protein is released into the ER lumen.\n\n**Summary of Final Topology:**\n- The N-terminal signal sequence is gone.\n- The mature N-terminus is in the ER lumen.\n- The stop-transfer sequence forms the first transmembrane domain.\n- The \"Loop 2\" segment connects the two transmembrane domains and is located in the cytosol.\n- The start-transfer sequence forms the second transmembrane domain.\n- The C-terminus is in the ER lumen.\n\nTherefore, the mature MP-7 protein is a double-pass (two transmembrane domains) protein with both its mature N-terminus and its C-terminus located in the ER lumen.
