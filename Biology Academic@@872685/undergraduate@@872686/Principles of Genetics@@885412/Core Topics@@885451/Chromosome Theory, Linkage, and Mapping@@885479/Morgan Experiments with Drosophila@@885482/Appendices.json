This foundational exercise tests your ability to correctly write the complete genotype of an individual fly, integrating your knowledge of autosomal inheritance, X-linkage, and the conventions of genetic notation that are essential for tracking genes from one generation to the next.", "problem": "In the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the gene for eye color is located on the X chromosome. The wild-type allele for red eyes ($w^{+}$) is dominant over the recessive mutant allele for white eyes ($w$). A different gene, located on an autosome (chromosome 2), controls wing shape. The wild-type allele for normal wings ($vg^{+}$) is dominant over the recessive mutant allele for vestigial wings ($vg$).\n\nA cross is performed between two individuals from different pure-breeding (homozygous) stocks. The parental female has white eyes and normal wings, while the parental male has red eyes and vestigial wings.\n\nIdentify the complete genotype of a female offspring from the first filial (F1) generation resulting from this cross. Use the standard genetic notation where alleles on homologous chromosomes are separated by a slash (`/`) and genes on non-homologous chromosomes are separated by a semicolon (`;`). The Y chromosome is denoted by `Y`.\n\nWhich of the following represents the correct genotype?\n\nA. $w^{+}/w ; vg/vg$\n\nB. $w/Y ; vg^{+}/vg$\n\nC. $w^{+}/w ; vg^{+}/vg$\n\nD. $w/w ; vg^{+}/vg^{+}$\n\nE. $w^{+}/Y ; vg/vg$", "solution": "The eye color gene is X-linked with wild-type red $w^{+}$ dominant over white $w$. The wing gene is autosomal on chromosome 2 with wild-type normal $vg^{+}$ dominant over vestigial $vg$. Both parents are from pure-breeding (homozygous) stocks.\n\nParental female phenotype: white eyes (recessive) and normal wings (dominant). Pure-breeding requires homozygosity for both loci. Thus for the X-linked eye gene she must be $w/w$, and for the autosomal wing gene she must be $vg^{+}/vg^{+}$. Therefore the parental female genotype is $w/w ; vg^{+}/vg^{+}$.\n\nParental male phenotype: red eyes (dominant) and vestigial wings (recessive). As a male, he is hemizygous for the X-linked gene and, being from a pure-breeding stock for red, must carry $w^{+}$ on his single X, giving $w^{+}/Y$ for the sex chromosomes. For the autosomal wing gene, pure-breeding vestigial requires $vg/vg$. Therefore the parental male genotype is $w^{+}/Y ; vg/vg$.\n\nForming F1 females:\n- For the X-linked gene, an F1 female receives one X from the mother and one X from the father. The mother can only contribute $w$ (since $w/w$), and the father contributes $w^{+}$ (since F1 females must inherit the paternal X to be XX). Thus the F1 female X-linked genotype is $w^{+}/w$.\n- For the autosomal gene, the mother can only contribute $vg^{+}$ (since $vg^{+}/vg^{+}$), and the father can only contribute $vg$ (since $vg/vg$). Thus the F1 female autosomal genotype is $vg^{+}/vg$.\n\nCombining both loci, the complete genotype of an F1 female is $w^{+}/w ; vg^{+}/vg$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1504580"}, {"introduction": "A key element of Thomas Hunt Morgan's groundbreaking work was his use of carefully designed crosses to reveal fundamental genetic principles. This problem puts you in the shoes of a geneticist, tasking you with designing a single, decisive experiment to determine if a newly discovered trait is sex-linked or autosomal. Successfully solving this requires you to understand and predict the unique pattern of \"criss-cross inheritance\" that is the hallmark of X-linked genes.", "problem": "A geneticist working with the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* discovers a new spontaneous mutation that causes forked bristles on the fly's body. Through initial crosses, it is determined that this forked-bristle trait is caused by a single recessive allele, which we will denote as $f$. The dominant wild-type allele, which results in straight bristles, is denoted as $f^{+}$. The geneticist has access to two true-breeding stocks: one with forked bristles and one with wild-type bristles.\n\nTo determine if the gene for bristle shape is located on an autosome or on the X chromosome, the geneticist performs a single, decisive cross: a true-breeding forked-bristle female is crossed with a true-breeding wild-type male.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes observed in the F1 generation would provide definitive evidence that the forked-bristle gene is X-linked?\n\nA. All F1 offspring, both males and females, have forked bristles.\n\nB. All F1 offspring, both males and females, have wild-type bristles.\n\nC. All F1 females have wild-type bristles, and all F1 males have forked bristles.\n\nD. All F1 females have forked bristles, and all F1 males have wild-type bristles.\n\nE. The F1 generation consists of approximately 50% wild-type females, 50% forked females, 50% wild-type males, and 50% forked males.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify which experimental outcome from a specific cross would definitively prove that a recessive gene is X-linked rather than autosomal. The cross is between a true-breeding forked-bristle female and a true-breeding wild-type male. Let's analyze the expected outcomes for both the autosomal and X-linked hypotheses.\n\nLet $f$ be the recessive allele for forked bristles and $f^{+}$ be the dominant allele for wild-type bristles.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: The gene is autosomal.**\nIn this case, the location of the gene is on a non-sex chromosome.\n- The true-breeding forked-bristle female has the genotype $f/f$. She can only produce gametes containing the $f$ allele.\n- The true-breeding wild-type male has the genotype $f^{+}/f^{+}$. He can only produce gametes containing the $f^{+}$ allele.\n\nWe can set up a Punnett square for the F1 generation:\nParental Cross: $f/f$ (female) $\\times$ $f^{+}/f^{+}$ (male)\nGametes from female: $f$\nGametes from male: $f^{+}$\n\nAll F1 offspring will have the genotype $f^{+}/f$. Since the $f^{+}$ allele is dominant, the phenotype of all F1 offspring, both male and female, will be wild-type (straight bristles). This outcome corresponds to option B.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: The gene is X-linked.**\nIn this case, the gene is located on the X chromosome. In *Drosophila*, females are XX and males are XY.\n- The true-breeding forked-bristle female has the genotype $X^{f}/X^{f}$. She can only produce gametes containing the $X^{f}$ chromosome.\n- The true-breeding wild-type male has the genotype $X^{f+}/Y$. He produces two types of gametes in equal proportions: those with the $X^{f+}$ chromosome and those with the Y chromosome.\n\nWe can set up a Punnett square for the F1 generation:\nParental Cross: $X^{f}/X^{f}$ (female) $\\times$ $X^{f+}/Y$ (male)\n\n| | Gametes from Female: $X^{f}$ |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| **Gametes from Male** | |\n| $X^{f+}$ | $X^{f+}/X^{f}$ |\n| $Y$ | $X^{f}/Y$ |\n\nLet's analyze the genotypes and phenotypes of the F1 offspring:\n- All F1 females will have the genotype $X^{f+}/X^{f}$. Since the $f^{+}$ allele is dominant, they will all exhibit the wild-type phenotype (straight bristles).\n- All F1 males will have the genotype $X^{f}/Y$. Since males have only one X chromosome, they will express the allele present on it. They will therefore exhibit the forked-bristle phenotype.\n\nSo, if the gene is X-linked, this specific cross will produce F1 females that are all wild-type and F1 males that are all forked-bristled. This is a classic example of criss-cross inheritance, where the male offspring inherit the trait of their mother.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- If the gene were autosomal, all F1 offspring would be wild-type (Option B).\n- If the gene is X-linked, the F1 generation will consist of wild-type females and forked-bristle males.\n\nThis distinct, sex-dependent outcome is different from the autosomal case and is therefore definitive proof of X-linkage. This outcome matches option C.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n- Option A is incorrect because $f$ is recessive. A cross with a wild-type parent cannot produce all recessive offspring.\n- Option B is the expected result for an autosomal gene, so it would disprove X-linkage, not prove it.\n- Option D describes the result of the reciprocal cross ($X^{f+}/X^{f+}$ female $\\times$ $X^{f}/Y$ male), not the cross described in the problem.\n- Option E describes ratios inconsistent with a cross between two true-breeding parents.\n\nTherefore, the only outcome that definitively proves X-linkage is the one where F1 females are wild-type and F1 males are forked.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1504616"}, {"introduction": "Nature often presents variations on Mendel's classic ratios, and lethal alleles are a common example of this.
