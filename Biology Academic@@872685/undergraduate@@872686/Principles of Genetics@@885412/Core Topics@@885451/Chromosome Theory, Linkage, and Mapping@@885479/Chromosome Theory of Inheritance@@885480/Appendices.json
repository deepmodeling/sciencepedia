This practice solidifies your understanding of ploidy by having you trace the chromosome number through the distinct life stages of a fern, from the diploid sporophyte to the haploid gametophyte and back to the zygote. By working through this scenario, you'll connect the abstract concepts of $n$ and $2n$ to the concrete, observable count of chromosomes in an organism's cells [@problem_id:1476986].", "problem": "A botanist specializing in paleobiology is studying a newly discovered species of living fossil fern. Through karyotyping, it is determined that the somatic cells, taken from the fronds of the mature fern (the sporophyte stage), contain 84 chromosomes. The life cycle of this fern follows the typical pattern of alternation of generations. The diploid sporophyte ($2n$) produces haploid spores ($n$) through the process of meiosis. These spores, when they land on a suitable substrate, germinate and grow into a small, independent, heart-shaped organism called a gametophyte. The gametophyte is haploid ($n$) and produces gametes (egg and sperm) via mitosis. Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell fuses with an egg cell, forming a diploid zygote ($2n$), which then develops into a new sporophyte, completing the cycle.\n\nBased on this complete biological description, determine the number of chromosomes you would expect to find in a single cell of the fern's gametophyte and in the zygote, respectively. Your answer should be a pair of integers.", "solution": "The problem states that the somatic cells of the mature fern (the sporophyte, which is diploid) contain 84 chromosomes. By definition of diploidy in this life cycle, the sporophyte has chromosome number $2n$, so:\n$$\n2n = 84.\n$$\nSolving for the haploid number $n$ gives:\n$$\nn = \\frac{84}{2} = 42.\n$$\nIn alternation of generations, meiosis in the diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores, so the gametophyte that develops from these spores is haploid with $n$ chromosomes. Therefore, a single cell of the gametophyte has:\n$$\nn = 42 \\text{ chromosomes}.\n$$\nGametes are produced by mitosis in the haploid gametophyte and thus are also $n=42$. At fertilization, fusion of two haploid gametes restores diploidy, producing a zygote with:\n$$\n2n = 84 \\text{ chromosomes}.\n$$\nThus, the expected chromosome numbers are $42$ for the gametophyte cell and $84$ for the zygote.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}42 & 84\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1476986"}, {"introduction": "A key prediction of the Chromosome Theory is that genes are arranged in a linear sequence on chromosomes, and the frequency of recombination between linked genes provides a measure of their physical distance. This principle allows us to construct genetic maps, which are crucial tools in genetics. In this exercise, you will act as a geneticist, using pairwise recombination data from a series of test crosses to deduce the correct order of four genes on a single chromosome, a fundamental skill in genetic analysis [@problem_id:2318096].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a newly discovered species of flowering plant, *Astraea floribunda*. Through a series of genetic crosses, four linked genes on a single chromosome were identified. These genes control distinct traits: petal color (locus *P*), fruit shape (locus *F*), stem texture (locus *S*), and leaf margin (locus *L*). To determine the arrangement of these genes, the geneticist performed a series of two-point test crosses and recorded the following recombination frequencies between pairs of genes:\n\n- *F* and *S*: 15%\n- *P* and *S*: 25%\n- *F* and *P*: 10%\n- *S* and *L*: 5%\n- *P* and *L*: 30%\n- *F* and *L*: 20%\n\nBased on these data, determine the linear order of the four genes on the chromosome.\n\nA.

The largest recombination frequency is between *P* and *L* (30%), suggesting they are the outermost genes.\n\nGiven recombination fractions (expressed as decimals):\n- $r(F,S)=0.15$\n- $r(P,S)=0.25$\n- $r(F,P)=0.10$\n- $r(S,L)=0.05$\n- $r(P,L)=0.30$\n- $r(F,L)=0.20$\n\nStep 1: Identify the two genes with the largest recombination frequency to anchor the map ends. This is the pair *P* and *L* at 30%. Our map is anchored by P ----- L.\n\nStep 2: Place the other genes relative to the anchors. Let's place gene *F* relative to *P*. The distance $r(F,P)=0.10$. This means *F* is close to *P*. The order could be P-F---L.\n\nStep 3: Place gene *S* relative to the others. We are given $r(F,S)=0.15$ and $r(P,S)=0.25$. If the order is P-F-S, then the distance from P to S should be the sum of P-F and F-S. Let's check: $r(P,F) + r(F,S) = 0.10 + 0.15 = 0.25$. This perfectly matches the given $r(P,S)=0.25$. This confirms the order P-F-S.\n\nStep 4: Combine the segments. We have P-F-S from Step 3 and the anchor P-----L from Step 1.

This phenomenon, known as genetic interference, reveals that a crossover in one region can inhibit another from occurring nearby, a detail that reflects the physical constraints on the chromosome.

The parental cross `CAB/CAB x cab/cab` produces an F1 heterozygote with genotype `CAB/cab`.\n\nStep 1: Identify parental, single crossover (SCO), and double crossover (DCO) classes from the progeny counts.\n- Parental (most frequent): Purple, Jagged, Hairy (`CAB`) and yellow, smooth, smooth (`cab`). Counts are 759 each.\n- DCO (least frequent): yellow, Jagged, smooth (`cAb`) and Purple, smooth, Hairy (`CaB`). Counts are 9 each.\n\nStep 2: Determine the gene order. Compare a parental haplotype (e.g., `CAB`) with a DCO haplotype (e.g., `cAb`). The allele that remains in its parental position relative to the other two is the middle gene. Here, `A` is in the same position while `C` and `B` have swapped.
