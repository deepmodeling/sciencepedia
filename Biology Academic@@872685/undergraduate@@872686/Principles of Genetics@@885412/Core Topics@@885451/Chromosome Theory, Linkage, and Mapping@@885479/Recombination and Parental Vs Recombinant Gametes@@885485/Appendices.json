This comprehensive exercise requires you to identify parental, single-crossover, and double-crossover offspring to construct a genetic map from scratch, a cornerstone technique in classical genetics.", "problem": "A team of plant geneticists is working to improve a commercial strain of barley. They have discovered a new recessive mutation, designated *hps*, which confers higher protein content in the seeds but unfortunately also leads to a slightly brittle stalk. They wish to map this new gene relative to two well-characterized marker genes on chromosome 3H. The first marker gene controls awn length, with the dominant allele *L* resulting in long awns and the recessive allele *l* resulting in short awns. The second marker gene affects leaf color, with the dominant allele *Y* producing yellow-green leaves and the recessive allele *y* producing dark green leaves. The wild-type allele for the new gene is *hps*⁺, which corresponds to normal protein content.\n\nTo initiate the mapping, a true-breeding barley plant with long awns, yellow-green leaves, and normal protein content was crossed with a true-breeding plant with short awns, dark green leaves, and high protein content. The resulting F1 progeny were all heterozygous for the three genes. These F1 plants were then test-crossed with a plant homozygous recessive for all three genes (short awns, dark green leaves, high protein content).\n\nThe phenotypes of 2500 progeny from this test cross were recorded as follows:\n\n- 925 plants with long awns, yellow-green leaves, normal protein content\n- 925 plants with short awns, dark green leaves, high protein content\n- 200 plants with long awns, dark green leaves, normal protein content\n- 200 plants with short awns, yellow-green leaves, high protein content\n- 100 plants with long awns, dark green leaves, high protein content\n- 100 plants with short awns, yellow-green leaves, normal protein content\n- 25 plants with long awns, yellow-green leaves, high protein content\n- 25 plants with short awns, dark green leaves, normal protein content\n\nBased on this data, which of the following options correctly describes the linear order of the three genes and the map distances between them in centiMorgans (cM)?\n\nA.

In such a cross, the most frequent progeny classes are nonrecombinant (parental), the least frequent are double crossovers (DCO), and single-crossover (SCO) classes have intermediate frequencies. Gene order is inferred by comparing parental and DCO classes: in DCOs, only the allele at the middle gene differs relative to the parentals.\n\nIdentify parental and DCO classes from the counts:\n- Parental (largest): 925 *L Y hps*⁺ and 925 *l y hps*.\n- DCO (smallest): 25 *L Y hps* and 25 *l y hps*⁺.\n\nComparing a parental (*L Y hps*⁺) to its DCO counterpart (*L Y hps*) shows that only the *hps* allele changes.

This final exercise explores this important conceptual limit, asking what happens to recombination frequencies when genes are located very far apart on the same chromosome [@problem_id:1516980]. Solving this helps clarify the crucial distinction between genetic map distance and recombination frequency, revealing why even linked genes can sometimes appear to assort independently.", "problem": "In the fictional flowering plant *Arabidopsis imaginaria*, two genes control distinct traits: one gene affects leaf shape (Allele *C* for curly leaves is dominant to allele *c* for flat leaves), and another affects flower scent (Allele *F* for fragrant flowers is dominant to allele *f* for scentless flowers). A geneticist performs a cross between a true-breeding plant with curly leaves and fragrant flowers and a true-breeding plant with flat leaves and scentless flowers. The resulting F1 dihybrid offspring, which has the genotype *CcFf*, is then used to produce gametes. Extensive genetic mapping has previously established that the leaf shape gene and the flower scent gene are located on the same chromosome, separated by a distance of 145 map units (also known as centimorgans, cM).\n\nWhat proportion of the gametes produced by this F1 dihybrid plant is expected to be recombinant?

The proportion of recombinant gametes is the recombination fraction $r$, defined as the probability that an odd number of crossovers occurs between the two loci during meiosis, because only an odd number of crossovers yields recombinant chromatids.\n\nMap distance in centimorgans approximates recombination fraction for short intervals via $d \\text{ (cM)} \\approx 100r$, but for larger distances multiple crossovers (including even numbers) occur, which reduce the observed recombination fraction.
