To uncover the complete genetic picture, a specific experimental procedure called a test cross is employed. This foundational exercise challenges you to design the most effective cross to determine an unknown genotype, a crucial skill for any geneticist working with model organisms. [@problem_id:1470129]", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a newly discovered species of bioluminescent beetle, *Lampyris eximius*. In this species, the trait for abdomen color is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for a green abdomen, denoted by $G$, is autosomal dominant over the allele for a yellow abdomen, denoted by $g$. The geneticist has captured a male beetle with a green abdomen from the wild and wishes to determine its exact genotype to establish a pure-breeding (homozygous) line for laboratory studies. The lab has a large stock of beetles that are known to be pure-breeding for the yellow abdomen phenotype. Which of the following experimental crosses would be the most direct and conclusive method for determining if the captured green male is homozygous dominant ($GG$) or heterozygous ($Gg$)?\n\nA. Cross the green male with a female beetle that also has a green abdomen.\n\nB. Cross the green male with a female beetle from the lab's stock of yellow-abdomen beetles.\n\nC. Cross the green male with a yellow female, and then allow the first-generation offspring to interbreed among themselves.\n\nD. Cross the green male with one of its own female offspring produced from an initial cross with a yellow-abdomened female.", "solution": "We are told that abdomen color is determined by a single autosomal gene with two alleles, where $G$ (green) is completely dominant over $g$ (yellow). A green male could therefore be either $GG$ (homozygous dominant) or $Gg$ (heterozygous). The goal is to determine which genotype the green male has in the most direct and conclusive way.\n\nPrinciple: Under simple Mendelian inheritance with complete dominance, the standard method to determine the genotype of an individual showing the dominant phenotype is a test cross, i.e., crossing the individual with a homozygous recessive ($gg$) tester. The phenotypes of the offspring reveal the genotype of the tested parent.\n\nLet the captured male be either $GG$ or $Gg$. The lab has pure-breeding yellow beetles, which are $gg$.\n\nCase 1: If the male is $GG$, then crossing with a $gg$ female yields:\n- Male gametes: only $G$.\n- Female gametes: only $g$.\n- Offspring: all $Gg$.\nFormally,\n$$\nGG \\times gg \\rightarrow \\text{offspring all } Gg \\ (\\text{probability } 1),\n$$\nso all offspring are green.\n\nCase 2: If the male is $Gg$, then crossing with a $gg$ female yields:\n- Male gametes: $G$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $g$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Female gametes: only $g$.\n- Offspring genotypes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\ Gg \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{2} \\ gg,\n$$\nso half of the offspring are green and half are yellow in expectation. The appearance of any yellow offspring implies the male is $Gg$; if all offspring are green (with sufficient sample size), that supports $GG$.\n\nTherefore, crossing the green male with a known $gg$ female is both direct and conclusive in a single generation. This corresponds to option B.\n\nWhy the other options are not as direct or conclusive:\n- Option A: Crossing with a green female (unknown genotype) is inconclusive because a green female could be $GG$ or $Gg$, producing multiple possible outcomes that do not uniquely identify the male’s genotype.\n- Option C: Crossing with a yellow female and then interbreeding the first-generation offspring adds an unnecessary extra generation; the initial test cross already distinguishes $GG$ from $Gg$ directly.\n- Option D: Crossing the male with one of its own female offspring from an initial cross with a yellow female is less direct and depends on the genotype of that offspring (which could be $Gg$ or $gg$), again adding unnecessary steps compared to the immediate test cross with $gg$.\n\nThus, the most direct and conclusive cross is with a homozygous recessive yellow female from the lab stock.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1470129"}, {"introduction": "Once we know the genotypes of parents, we can move from determining genetic makeup to predicting it. Since inheritance is fundamentally a game of chance, we use the rules of probability to forecast the likelihood of specific outcomes in offspring. This problem simulates a common genetic counseling scenario, asking you to calculate the chances of a particular family composition for a couple where one partner is affected by an autosomal dominant disorder. [@problem_id:1470147]", "problem": "A genetic counselor is advising a couple. One partner has been diagnosed with Cerebellar Hyperexcitability Syndrome (CHS), a rare neurological condition. CHS is known to be caused by a single autosomal dominant allele, and it exhibits complete penetrance, meaning anyone with the allele will express the disorder. The affected partner's father also had CHS, but their mother was unaffected. The other partner is unaffected by CHS and has no family history of the disorder.\n\nThe couple plans to have three children. Assuming the gender of the children has no bearing on the outcome, calculate the probability that they will have exactly two children affected with CHS and one unaffected child. The order of birth for the affected and unaffected children does not matter.\n\nExpress your final answer as a fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "Let $A$ denote the autosomal dominant allele causing CHS and $a$ denote the normal allele. Because CHS has complete penetrance, any individual with genotype containing at least one $A$ is affected, and unaffected individuals must be $aa$.\n\nThe affected partner’s mother is unaffected, hence her genotype is $aa$ and she contributes only the $a$ allele to her offspring. Since the affected partner is affected, they must have received an $A$ allele from their affected father. Therefore, the affected partner’s genotype is $Aa$.\n\nThe other partner is unaffected and, given complete penetrance, must have genotype $aa$. Thus the mating is $Aa \\times aa$.\n\nFor each child, the affected parent transmits $A$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $a$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, while the unaffected parent always transmits $a$.

One such complication is incomplete penetrance, where possessing a disease-causing allele does not guarantee the appearance of the disease. This advanced problem requires you to use conditional probability to revise the risk for an individual based on their own phenotype, a key task in modern genetic risk assessment. [@problem_id:1470109]", "problem": "A fictional late-onset neurological disorder known as Synaptic Resonance Decay (SRD) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The disorder exhibits incomplete penetrance, meaning that not all individuals who inherit the pathogenic allele will express the phenotype. For SRD, the penetrance is 80%.\n\nA woman is seeking genetic counseling. She is currently 40 years old and phenotypically normal. Her father and her paternal uncle (her father's brother) were both diagnosed with SRD. The woman's mother is from a family with no history of the disorder, and she is phenotypically normal.\n\nAssuming the disorder is rare and that individuals marrying into the family have a wild-type genotype unless stated otherwise, calculate the probability that this woman is a carrier of the pathogenic allele for SRD.\n\nProvide your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Let $D$ represent the dominant pathogenic allele for Synaptic Resonance Decay (SRD) and $d$ represent the recessive, wild-type allele. An individual is a \"carrier\" if they have the genotype $Dd$. An individual is affected if they have at least one $D$ allele and express the phenotype. An individual is phenotypically normal if they do not express the phenotype.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the father's genotype.**\nThe woman's father is affected by SRD. Since the disorder is dominant, an affected individual must have at least one $D$ allele. Their genotype could be $DD$ or $Dd$. However, since the disorder is stated to be rare, it is standard practice to assume that affected individuals are heterozygotes ($Dd$) unless there is evidence to the contrary (e.g., offspring from two affected parents). Moreover, the fact that an individual is affected implies they must carry the $D$ allele. Therefore, we can confidently deduce the father's genotype is $Dd$. The information about the paternal uncle also being affected reinforces that the $D$ allele is segregating in the paternal line, consistent with the father being $Dd$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the mother's genotype.**\nThe woman's mother is from a family with no history of the disorder and is phenotypically normal. Based on the problem's assumption, she is considered to have the wild-type genotype, which is $dd$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the prior probability of the woman being a carrier.**\nThe woman is the offspring of a cross between her father ($Dd$) and her mother ($dd$).\nThe possible genotypes for their offspring are:\n- $Dd$ (with probability 1/2)\n- $dd$ (with probability 1/2)\nSo, the prior probability that the woman is a carrier (genotype $Dd$) is $P(\\text{Carrier}) = 1/2$. The prior probability she is a non-carrier (genotype $dd$) is $P(\\text{Non-carrier}) = 1/2$.\n\n**Step 4: Use conditional probability to update the probability based on the woman's phenotype.**\nWe are given the crucial information that the woman is phenotypically normal. We need to calculate the probability that she is a carrier GIVEN that she is normal. This is a conditional probability problem that can be solved using Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that the woman is a carrier (genotype $Dd$).\nLet $N$ be the event that the woman is phenotypically normal.\nWe want to find $P(C|N)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C|N) = \\frac{P(N|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(N)}$$\n\nWe need to calculate each term in this equation.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the components of the Bayes' formula.**\n- $P(C)$: This is the prior probability that she is a carrier, which we found in Step 3.\n  $P(C) = 1/2$.\n\n- $P(N|C)$: This is the probability of being normal, given that she is a carrier ($Dd$). The problem states the penetrance of the disorder is 80%, which is the probability of being *affected* if you have the allele ($P(\\text{Affected}|C) = 0.8$). Therefore, the probability of being *normal* even with the allele is $1 - \\text{penetrance}$.\n  $P(N|C) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$.\n\n- $P(N)$: This is the total probability of the woman being normal. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:\n  $$P(N) = P(N|C) \\cdot P(C) + P(N|\\neg C) \\cdot P(\\neg C)$$\n  Here, $\\neg C$ is the event that the woman is not a carrier (genotype $dd$).\n  - We already have $P(N|C) = 0.2$ and $P(C) = 1/2$.\n  - $P(\\neg C) = P(\\text{Non-carrier}) = 1/2$.\n  - $P(N|\\neg C)$ is the probability of being normal given that she is not a carrier (genotype $dd$). If her genotype is $dd$, she does not have the pathogenic allele, so she must be phenotypically normal. Thus, $P(N|\\neg C) = 1$.\n  - Now, we can calculate $P(N)$:\n    $$P(N) = (0.2) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0.1 + 0.5 = 0.6$$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final probability.**\nNow we substitute the values back into the Bayes' theorem formula:\n$$P(C|N) = \\frac{P(N|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(N)} = \\frac{0.2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{0.6} = \\frac{0.1}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nThe probability that the woman is a carrier of the pathogenic allele, given that she is phenotypically normal, is 1/6.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$$", "id": "1470109"}]}
