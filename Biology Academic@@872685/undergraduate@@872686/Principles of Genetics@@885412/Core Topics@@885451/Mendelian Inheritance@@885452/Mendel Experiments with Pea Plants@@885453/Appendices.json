Two genes, which are located on different chromosomes, are of particular interest. The first gene, for herbicide resistance, has a dominant allele ($G$) that confers resistance and a recessive allele ($g$) that results in susceptibility. The second gene, for drought tolerance, has a dominant allele ($W$) that confers high tolerance and a recessive allele ($w$) that results in normal tolerance.\n\nTo begin their experiment, the scientists cross a true-breeding plant that is herbicide-resistant and has high drought tolerance with a true-breeding plant that is herbicide-susceptible and has normal drought tolerance. This initial cross produces the F1 generation. Subsequently, one of the F1 plants is allowed to self-pollinate, producing the F2 generation.\n\nAssuming independent assortment of these two genes, what is the probability that a randomly selected F2 offspring will be heterozygous for one gene but homozygous for the other? Express your answer as a single fraction.", "solution": "A true-breeding herbicide-resistant, high-drought-tolerance plant has genotype $GGWW$, and a true-breeding susceptible, normal-tolerance plant has genotype $ggww$. Crossing them yields F1 plants all with genotype $GgWw$.\n\nSelfing the F1 corresponds to the dihybrid cross $GgWw \\times GgWw$. By Mendel’s law of segregation for each locus in a $Gg \\times Gg$ monohybrid cross, the F2 genotype probabilities are\n$$P(GG)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Gg)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(gg)=\\frac{1}{4}.$$\nAnalogously for the $W$ locus from $Ww \\times Ww$,\n$$P(WW)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Ww)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(ww)=\\frac{1}{4}.$$\nBy Mendel’s law of independent assortment, the genotypes at the two loci are independent.

To determine its genotype, the researcher performs a test cross, mating this plant with another plant that is homozygous recessive for all four traits (white petals, short stem, wrinkled seeds, and smooth leaf margin).\n\nThe cross produces 200 offspring. The progeny are observed to fall into only two phenotypic classes in approximately equal numbers:\n1.  102 offspring with Purple petals, Tall stem, Smooth seeds, and Serrated leaf margin.\n2.  98 offspring with white petals, short stem, wrinkled seeds, and smooth leaf margin.\n\nNo other combination of these four traits is observed in the progeny. For the purposes of this problem, assume that the genes are completely linked if they are on the same chromosome, meaning no crossing over occurs. The notation $ABCD/abcd$ indicates that alleles `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` are on one chromosome and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are on the homologous chromosome.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the genotype of the original parent plant that had all dominant phenotypes?\n\nA.

The test cross involves mating the dominant-phenotype parent to a tester homozygous recessive at all loci, i.e., $pphhssmm$.\n\nPrinciple 1 (test cross and independence): If the dominant-phenotype parent is heterozygous at $n$ loci and the loci assort independently, a test cross produces $2^n$ phenotypic classes in equal frequency. For $n=4$, this would be $2^4=16$ classes, not just two. Therefore any option claiming independent assortment is incompatible with the observation of only two classes.\n\nPrinciple 2 (complete linkage without crossing over): If several loci are completely linked on the same chromosome and there is no crossing over, a heterozygote in coupling phase (e.g., $ABCD/abcd$) produces only two gamete types, $ABCD$ and $abcd$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. A test cross with $abcd/abcd$ then yields only two progeny classes, $ABCD/abcd$ (all dominant phenotypes) and $abcd/abcd$ (all recessive phenotypes), in a $1:1$ ratio.\n\nFrom the data:\n- The progeny comprise only two phenotypic classes, approximately equal in number: all dominant or all recessive.\n- The appearance of fully recessive progeny (white, short, wrinkled, smooth) requires that the dominant-phenotype parent carry recessive alleles at all four loci; hence it must be heterozygous at each locus. Therefore the genotype must be $PpHhSsMm$.\n\nNow evaluate each option using these principles:\n\n- Option A (independent assortment with $PpHhSsMm$): Would produce $2^4=16$ phenotypic classes in a test cross, not observed. Reject.\n\n- Option B (two linkage groups $PH/ph$ and $SM/sm$ assorting independently): The heterozygous parent would produce four gamete types $PHSM$, $PHsm$, $phSM$, $phsm$ with equal frequency, yielding four progeny phenotypic classes in a $1:1:1:1$ ratio, not observed. Reject.\n\n- Option C ($PPHHSsMm$ with independent assortment): Being homozygous dominant at $P$ and $H$ would prevent any white or short offspring in a test cross, contradicting the observed all-recessive class. Reject.\n\n- Option D ($PpHhSsMm$ with complete linkage in repulsion $PHsm/phSM$): With complete linkage and no recombination, the only gametes would be $PHsm$ and $phSM$. In a test cross to $phsm$, the progeny would be $PHsm/phsm$ (Purple, Tall, wrinkled, smooth) and $phSM/phsm$ (white, short, Smooth, Serrated), i.e., two mixed classes, not the observed all-dominant and all-recessive classes. Reject.\n\n- Option E ($PpHhSsMm$ with complete linkage in coupling $PHSM/phsm$): With complete linkage and no recombination, the only gametes from the heterozygous parent are $PHSM$ and $phsm$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The test cross to $phsm/phsm$ yields progeny $PHSM/phsm$ (all dominant phenotypes) and $phsm/phsm$ (all recessive phenotypes) in a $1:1$ ratio, exactly matching the observations.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with the data is complete linkage of all four genes in coupling phase with genotype $PpHhSsMm$ and arrangement $PHSM/phsm$, which is Option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1502467"}, {"introduction": "Real biological systems rarely follow simple rules, often involving multiple genes that interact in complex ways.
