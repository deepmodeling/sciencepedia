This problem [@problem_id:1481818] asks you to calculate the probability of a specific phenotypic combination from a cross of two individuals heterozygous for both traits. Mastering this calculation is key to understanding the famous $9:3:3:1$ phenotypic ratio that serves as a cornerstone of Mendelian genetics.", "problem": "In a fictional species of deep-sea anemone, *Corallimorphus spectabilis*, two independently assorting genes control its appearance. The first gene determines its tentacle structure, where the dominant allele $T$ results in feathery tentacles and the recessive allele $t$ results in smooth tentacles. The second gene controls its fluorescent properties, where the dominant allele $F$ codes for a bright green fluorescence under ultraviolet light, and the recessive allele $f$ results in no fluorescence.\n\nSuppose two anemones, both heterozygous for both genes ($TtFf$), reproduce. Assuming standard Mendelian inheritance, calculate the probability that an offspring will exhibit feathery tentacles and show no fluorescence.\n\nExpress your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "Let the two independently assorting loci be $T/t$ for tentacle structure and $F/f$ for fluorescence. Both parents are $TtFf$.\n\nBy Mendel’s law of segregation applied to each locus separately:\n- For the tentacle locus, the cross $Tt \\times Tt$ yields genotype probabilities $P(TT)=\\frac{1}{4}$, $P(Tt)=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $P(tt)=\\frac{1}{4}$. The phenotype “feathery tentacles” corresponds to $T\\_$, so\n$$\nP(\\text{feathery})=P(TT)+P(Tt)=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\n- For the fluorescence locus, the cross $Ff \\times Ff$ yields genotype probabilities $P(FF)=\\frac{1}{4}$, $P(Ff)=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $P(ff)=\\frac{1}{4}$. The phenotype “no fluorescence” corresponds to $ff$, so\n$$\nP(\\text{no fluorescence})=P(ff)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nBy Mendel’s law of independent assortment, the two loci assort independently, so the joint probability of feathery tentacles and no fluorescence is the product of the marginal probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{feathery and no fluorescence})=\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{16}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$$", "id": "1481818"}, {"introduction": "Building on the classic cross, this next practice [@problem_id:1481774] introduces a slight variation in the parental genotypes. By analyzing a cross where one parent is homozygous dominant for one trait and the other is homozygous recessive, you will see how the principles of independent assortment and the product rule apply universally. This exercise sharpens your ability to break down a complex cross into simpler, single-gene problems.", "problem": "In a particular species of flowering plant, petal color and pollen color are each determined by a single gene. For petal color, the allele for red petals (R) is completely dominant to the allele for white petals (r). For pollen color, the allele for yellow pollen (Y) is completely dominant to the allele for green pollen (y). The genes for petal color and pollen color are located on different chromosomes and therefore assort independently.\n\nA plant with the genotype $RRYy$ is crossed with a plant that has the genotype $rrYy$. Assuming Mendelian inheritance, what is the probability of producing an offspring with the genotype $RrYy$? Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "The genes are on different chromosomes, so the segregation at the $R/r$ locus is independent of the segregation at the $Y/y$ locus. Therefore, the probability of an offspring with genotype $RrYy$ is the product of the probabilities for each locus:\n$$\nP(RrYy)=P(Rr)\\cdot P(Yy).\n$$\nFor the $R/r$ locus: the cross is $RR \\times rr$. The $RR$ parent contributes $R$ in every gamete, and the $rr$ parent contributes $r$ in every gamete, so every offspring is $Rr$. Thus,\n$$\nP(Rr)=1.\n$$\nFor the $Y/y$ locus: the cross is $Yy \\times Yy$. Each parent produces $Y$ and $y$ gametes with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ each, so the offspring genotype probabilities are\n$$\nP(YY)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Yy)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(yy)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\nP(Yy)=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nBy independence,\n$$\nP(RrYy)=1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "1481774"}, {"introduction": "The power of Mendelian genetics lies in its scalability, and this final practice challenges you to apply your skills to a more complex scenario involving three traits. This hypothetical trihybrid cross [@problem_id:1481829] demonstrates that the Law of Independent Assortment and the product rule are not limited to two genes. By successfully navigating this problem, you will confirm your understanding of how to predict genetic outcomes for any number of independently assorting traits.", "problem": "In a particular species of dragon, a classic model organism for studying Mendelian genetics, three autosomal genes located on different chromosomes control distinct traits. The first gene determines scale color, with the allele for red scales ($A$) being completely dominant over the allele for gold scales ($a$). The second gene controls the presence of horns, where the allele for having horns ($B$) is completely dominant over the allele for being hornless ($b$). The third gene affects fire-breathing ability, with the allele for producing fire ($C$) being completely dominant over the allele for producing only smoke ($c$).\n\nTwo dragons, both of which are heterozygous for all three genes, are mated. What is the probability that their offspring will have gold scales, possess horns, and be able to breathe fire, while also being homozygous for all three of these traits?
