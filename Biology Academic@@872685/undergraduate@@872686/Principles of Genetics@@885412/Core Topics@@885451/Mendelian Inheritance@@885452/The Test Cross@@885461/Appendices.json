By crossing this individual with a homozygous recessive partner, the resulting offspring phenotypes directly reveal the gametes produced by the dominant parent. This exercise [@problem_id:1528912] walks you through a classic scenario, but adds a layer of quantitative rigor by asking you to use the chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) test. This statistical tool is essential for judging whether the deviation between your observed experimental data and the theoretically expected ratio is simply due to random chance or suggests a different underlying genetic reality.", "problem": "A genetics researcher in a commercial laboratory is working to verify their breeding stock of mice. The coat color in these mice is governed by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele for black coat color ($B$) and a recessive allele for brown coat color ($b$).\n\nThe breeding program begins by crossing a pure-breeding black mouse (genotype $BB$) with a pure-breeding brown mouse (genotype $bb$). This produces an F1 generation. To empirically verify that these F1 mice are, as predicted, heterozygous ($Bb$), the researcher performs a test cross. A single F1 black mouse is crossed with a pure-breeding brown mouse. This test cross results in a litter of 24 offspring. Upon inspection, the researcher counts 15 black mice and 9 brown mice.\n\nTo quantitatively assess the deviation of these observed results from the theoretical prediction, the researcher decides to calculate a chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) statistic. Assuming the null hypothesis that the F1 parent was indeed heterozygous and that any deviation is due to random chance, what is the calculated $\\chi^2$ value for this experiment?\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Under a single-gene, two-allele system with a dominant allele $B$ (black) and recessive allele $b$ (brown), a cross $BB \\times bb$ produces F1 offspring all of genotype $Bb$, which are black. A test cross of an F1 black mouse ($Bb$) with a pure-breeding brown mouse ($bb$) is predicted to yield a $1:1$ phenotypic ratio of black to brown offspring under the null hypothesis that the F1 parent is heterozygous and deviations arise from random sampling.\n\nLet the total number of offspring be $N=24$.

When two genes are located on the same chromosome (i.e., they are linked), the frequency of recombinant offspring in a test cross is a direct measure of the genetic distance between them. This practice [@problem_id:1533836] moves from single-gene analysis to the relationship between two genes, demonstrating how to convert raw offspring counts into map units (centiMorgans), the currency of genetic maps.

A dihybrid female fly, heterozygous for both genes, is crossed with a male fly that is homozygous recessive for both traits (garnet eyes and curved wings).\n\nThe cross produces a total of 1000 offspring. Upon analyzing the progeny, the geneticist observes that 918 offspring exhibit parental phenotypes (either wild-type for both traits, or garnet eyes and curved wings), while 82 offspring exhibit recombinant phenotypes (either wild-type eyes and curved wings, or garnet eyes and wild-type wings).\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the genetic map distance between the garnet eye locus and the curved wing locus.
