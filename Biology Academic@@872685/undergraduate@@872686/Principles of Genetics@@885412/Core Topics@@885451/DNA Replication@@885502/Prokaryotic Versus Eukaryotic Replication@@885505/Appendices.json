It uses a single origin of replication located exactly at the center of the DNA fragment. From this origin, two replication forks initiate and proceed in opposite directions towards the ends of the fragment, with each fork moving at a constant speed of $v_B = 8.00 \\times 10^2$ bp per second.\n\nSystem 2 is modeled on human replication. It uses multiple origins of replication that are all activated simultaneously. These origins are spaced along the fragment such that the distance between any two adjacent origins is $d = 1.50 \\times 10^5$ bp. Bidirectional replication occurs from each origin, with each fork moving at a constant speed of $v_H = 50.0$ bp per second until it meets a fork from an adjacent origin. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume the origins are placed such that the time to replicate the entire fragment is determined by the time it takes for adjacent forks to meet.\n\nLet $T_B$ be the total time required to completely replicate the DNA fragment using System 1, and $T_H$ be the total time required using System 2.

This problem [@problem_id:1514891] simulates a molecular genetics experiment where a specific inhibitor knocks out the function of DNA polymerase $\\delta$, the enzyme responsible for lagging strand extension. By calculating the total amount of DNA synthesized under these conditions, you will gain a deeper understanding of the distinct and non-redundant roles these enzymes play in ensuring accurate and complete replication.", "problem": "In a laboratory study of eukaryotic DNA replication, an in-vitro system is prepared with a long, linear DNA molecule and all the necessary proteins and nucleotides. At time $t=0$, a single replication bubble is initiated precisely at the center of this DNA molecule. From this origin, two replication forks begin moving in opposite directions along the DNA.\n\nThe key components of the replication machinery and their properties in this system are defined as follows:\n- The helicase at each replication fork unwinds the parental DNA at a constant rate of $v$ base pairs per second.\n- The DNA Polymerase $\\alpha$-primase complex (Pol $\\alpha$) is responsible for initiating DNA synthesis. For each initiation event, it first synthesizes a short RNA primer (whose length is irrelevant for this problem), followed by an initiator DNA segment of constant length $L_{dna}$.\n- On the leading strand, DNA Polymerase $\\epsilon$ (Pol $\\epsilon$) immediately takes over from Pol $\\alpha$ and synthesizes DNA continuously as the fork progresses, keeping pace with the helicase.\n- On the lagging strand, the system is set up such that Pol $\\alpha$ is recruited to synthesize a new primer every time the helicase has unwound a segment of length $L_{ok}$. Following this, DNA Polymerase $\\delta$ (Pol $\\delta$) is normally responsible for extending these primers to create the full Okazaki fragments.\n\nAt the exact moment of initiation ($t=0$), a potent and highly specific inhibitor is added to the system. This inhibitor completely and instantaneously blocks all enzymatic activity of Pol $\\delta$. The drug has no effect on the function of Pol $\\alpha$, Pol $\\epsilon$, or the helicase.\n\nAfter the replication process has continued under these conditions for a total time $T$, what is the total length of all newly synthesized *DNA* (measured in base pairs) within the entire replication bubble? Assume that the time required for all polymerase switching and primer synthesis events is negligible. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $v, T, L_{dna}$, and $L_{ok}$. Your expression may involve the floor function, denoted by $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.", "solution": "At time $t=0$, two replication forks start at the origin and move in opposite directions. The helicase at each fork unwinds DNA at rate $v$, so after time $T$ the distance advanced by each fork is\n$$\nd=vT.\n$$\nLeading-strand synthesis: On each fork, the leading-strand polymerase (Pol $\\epsilon$) synthesizes DNA continuously in lockstep with the helicase, and the time for initiation and switching is negligible. Therefore, the length of newly synthesized leading-strand DNA produced by one fork in time $T$ equals the unwound distance $d=vT$. Since there are two forks (hence two leading strands), the total leading-strand DNA is\n$$\nL_{\\text{lead}}=2vT.\n$$\nLagging-strand synthesis: On each fork, a new Okazaki initiation event (primer plus Pol $\\alpha$ initiator DNA) is triggered every time an additional length $L_{ok}$ is unwound.
