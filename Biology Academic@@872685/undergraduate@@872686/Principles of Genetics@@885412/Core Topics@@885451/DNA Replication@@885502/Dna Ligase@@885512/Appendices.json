The circular plasmid vector is 4.5 kilobase pairs (kb) in size and contains a single recognition site for the restriction enzyme BamHI. The Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragment to be inserted is 1.2 kb and has been engineered to have BamHI recognition sites at both ends.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  The circular plasmid vector is completely digested with BamHI, resulting in a linearized vector.\n2.  The 1.2 kb DNA insert is also treated with BamHI to ensure it has compatible \"sticky\" ends.\n3.  The linearized plasmid vector and the prepared DNA insert are mixed in an appropriate molar ratio in a ligation buffer.\n4.  An enzyme, DNA ligase, is added to the mixture to catalyze the formation of phosphodiester bonds, intending to create a recombinant plasmid.\n\nHowever, the student unknowingly uses a batch of DNA ligase that was previously left at a high temperature for an extended period, causing it to be completely denatured and non-functional.

DNA ligase is not just a molecular \"glue\"; its action follows a precise biochemical mechanism with strict requirements. This problem [@problem_id:1482686] presents a scenario where the insert DNA is missing a critical 5'-phosphate group, challenging you to predict the consequences for both the ligation reaction and the subsequent bacterial transformation. This exercise highlights the importance of understanding the enzymatic mechanism for troubleshooting complex experimental results.", "problem": "A researcher is performing a molecular cloning experiment to insert a specific Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) fragment into a plasmid vector. The plasmid vector, of length $L_v$, carries a single gene for ampicillin resistance. It has been linearized by a restriction enzyme, creating compatible ends that each possess a 5'-phosphate group and a 3'-hydroxyl group.\n\nThe DNA insert, of length $L_i$, was prepared using a non-standard enzymatic method. As a result, both ends of the double-stranded insert possess 5'-hydroxyl groups and 3'-hydroxyl groups.\n\nThe researcher sets up a ligation reaction in a single tube containing the linearized vector, the defective DNA insert, ATP, and a suitable buffer with T4 DNA Ligase. After the reaction, the entire mixture is used to transform a population of competent *E. coli* bacteria that are sensitive to ampicillin. The transformed bacteria are then plated onto nutrient agar plates containing ampicillin and incubated to allow for colony growth.\n\nAssuming the transformation procedure is successful and that linear DNA is rapidly degraded within the *E. coli* cells, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected outcome of the experiment?\n\nA. A large number of ampicillin-resistant colonies will form, and subsequent analysis would show that most of these colonies contain the plasmid vector with the correctly integrated DNA insert.\n\nB.

A moderate number of ampicillin-resistant colonies will form, and subsequent analysis would show that they contain a plasmid where the insert is integrated, but with a single-strand break (a nick) at each of the two vector-insert junctions.\n\nD. No ampicillin-resistant colonies will form because the absence of a 5'-phosphate on the insert prevents any form of ligation, leaving all vectors linear and thus unable to confer resistance.\n\nE. A small number of ampicillin-resistant colonies will form, and they will contain a mix of re-circularized vectors and vectors with a tandem array of inserts ligated together.", "solution": "We analyze the ligation chemistry and the consequences for transformation and colony phenotypes step by step.\n\n1) T4 DNA ligase reaction requirements. T4 DNA ligase forms a phosphodiester bond only when a $3'$-hydroxyl attacks an adjacent $5'$-phosphate at a nick that has properly base-paired ends. Thus, for each nick to be sealed, the $5'$ terminus at that nick must carry a phosphate. If the $5'$ end carries a hydroxyl instead of a phosphate, T4 DNA ligase cannot seal that nick.\n\n2) End chemistries of the reactants. The linearized vector has, at each end, a $5'$-phosphate and a $3'$-hydroxyl. Therefore, the two nicks created when its compatible sticky ends anneal (during intramolecular ligation for re-circularization) both present $5'$-phosphate termini, allowing T4 DNA ligase to seal both strands and regenerate a covalently closed circular plasmid. The insert has, at both ends, $5'$-hydroxyl and $3'$-hydroxyl; therefore, at any junction where the insert contributes the $5'$ end, the nick cannot be sealed by T4 DNA ligase.\n\n3) Vector self-ligation outcome. Because both vector ends possess $5'$-phosphate, intramolecular re-circularization of the vector is fully supported. Annealing of the compatible ends followed by ligation seals both complementary nicks at that single vector-vector junction, yielding a covalently closed circular plasmid that efficiently transforms and confers ampicillin resistance.\n\n4) Vector-insert ligation topology. When the insert anneals into the vector, there are two vector-insert junctions. At each junction, there are two nicks (one in each strand). At each junction, exactly one of the two $5'$ ends is contributed by the vector (phosphorylated) and the other by the insert (dephosphorylated). T4 DNA ligase can therefore seal only the nick where the vector provides the $5'$-phosphate; the other nick at that junction (where the insert provides the $5'$ end) cannot be sealed in vitro. Consequently:\n- If both junctions anneal and the ligase seals the two nicks that have vector $5'$-phosphate, the product is a circular duplex with one remaining nick at each junction (two single-strand nicks total). Such nicked circles can, in principle, transform and be repaired in vivo, but their formation requires two independent ligation events (one at each junction) and proceeds with much lower efficiency than vector self-ligation.\n- Any partial product in which only one junction has ligated is linear overall and will be rapidly degraded in the cell, as stipulated.\n\n5) Insert-insert ligation is disallowed. A tandem array of inserts would require ligation at a junction where both $5'$ ends are from the insert; with both ends lacking $5'$-phosphate, neither nick at such a junction can be sealed by T4 DNA ligase, so covalent insert-insert concatemers do not form.\n\n6) Expected transformants. Because covalently closed circular plasmids transform most efficiently and because vector self-ligation is fully enabled whereas vector-insert circularization is kinetically disfavored (requiring two separate ligations and yielding only a nicked circle), the overwhelming and practically exclusive product that yields colonies is the re-circularized vector without the insert. Therefore:\n- Option A is incorrect: efficient insertion is not expected with a non-phosphorylated insert, and most colonies will not carry the correct insert.\n- Option C is mechanistically plausible for a minority species (nicked insert-containing circles), but describing the colonies as containing insert as a rule is inaccurate; in practice, the background of empty vector dominates.\n- Option D is incorrect: the vector’s phosphorylated ends allow self-ligation; thus ampicillin-resistant colonies will form.\n- Option E is incorrect: tandem arrays of inserts cannot form without $5'$-phosphates on insert ends; the surviving population will not contain such concatemers.\n\nHence, the most accurate description among the options is that ampicillin-resistant colonies arise from re-circularized vector lacking the insert, as stated in option B (the qualifier “moderate number” reflects typical yields relative to highly efficient transformations with pre-closed plasmids and the competition with degradation of any linear species).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1482686"}]}
