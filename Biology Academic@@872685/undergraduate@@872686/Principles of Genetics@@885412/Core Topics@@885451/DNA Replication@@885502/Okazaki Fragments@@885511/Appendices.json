This first exercise challenges you to identify the chemical nature of a newly synthesized Okazaki fragment before it undergoes processing, focusing on the distinct composition of its $5'$ and $3'$ ends. Mastering this concept [@problem_id:1506931] is the first step to appreciating the elegant, multi-step process required to mature the lagging strand into a continuous piece of DNA.", "problem": "During the process of DNA replication in a eukaryotic cell, the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short segments. Consider a single, newly synthesized Okazaki fragment that has been isolated immediately after its creation by DNA polymerase but before any subsequent processing, such as primer removal or ligation. This fragment is a linear, single-stranded nucleic acid polymer. Which of the following statements accurately describes the chemical nature of the terminal nucleotides at the 5' and 3' ends of this isolated, unprocessed Okazaki fragment?\n\nA. The 5' end is a ribonucleotide, and the 3' end is a deoxyribonucleotide.\n\nB. The 5' end is a deoxyribonucleotide, and the 3' end is a ribonucleotide.\n\nC. Both the 5' and 3' ends are ribonucleotides.\n\nD. Both the 5' and 3' ends are deoxyribonucleotides.\n\nE. The composition of the ends is random and cannot be determined, as it depends on the specific DNA sequence being replicated.", "solution": "Principle 1: On the lagging strand in eukaryotes, each Okazaki fragment is initiated by an RNA primer synthesized by primase (part of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex). The primer consists of ribonucleotides, and its $5'$ terminus defines the $5'$ end of the newly formed fragment before processing.\n\nPrinciple 2: DNA polymerase extends from the primer’s free $3'$ hydroxyl, incorporating deoxyribonucleotides to synthesize DNA. Thus, the elongating fragment’s growing end is the $3'$ end, composed of deoxyribonucleotides.\n\nImmediate consequence: An isolated, unprocessed Okazaki fragment contains an RNA segment at its $5'$ end (the primer) followed by a DNA segment extending to its $3'$ end. Therefore:\n- The $5'$ terminal nucleotide is a ribonucleotide (from the RNA primer).\n- The $3'$ terminal nucleotide is a deoxyribonucleotide (from DNA polymerase extension).\n\nConclusion: The correct description is that the $5'$ end is a ribonucleotide and the $3'$ end is a deoxyribonucleotide, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1506931"}, {"introduction": "Every Okazaki fragment is initiated by a short RNA primer, which provides the crucial starting point for DNA polymerase. This practice moves from the conceptual to the practical, asking you to simulate the action of the enzyme primase.

While this is straightforward for the leading strand, the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short segments known as Okazaki fragments. Each Okazaki fragment is initiated by a short Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) primer, which is synthesized by an enzyme called primase. This primer provides the necessary 3'-hydroxyl group for DNA polymerase to begin synthesis.\n\nConsider a specific initiation site on the lagging strand template of a eukaryotic organism.

This exercise [@problem_id:1506946] helps connect the molecular details of a single fragment to the overall logistics and resource requirements of genome duplication.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the replication of a circular plasmid, designated pANT, isolated from a specialized strain of *Escherichia coli*. The plasmid is known to replicate bidirectionally from a single origin of replication (oriC), creating two replication forks that proceed in opposite directions around the molecule until they meet. The entire double-stranded plasmid has a total length of $L = 20,400$ base pairs (bp).\n\nIn this prokaryotic system, the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as a series of Okazaki fragments. The average length of an Okazaki fragment is measured to be $l_{ok} = 1,200$ bp.

Since there are two forks, the total number of RNA primers for leading strands is\n$$\nN_{\\text{lead}}=2.\n$$\n\nFor lagging strands, each Okazaki fragment requires exactly one RNA primer. The total length synthesized as lagging strand across both forks equals the whole genome length, because each fork synthesizes lagging over a distance $L/2$, and there are two forks:\n$$\nL_{\\text{lag,total}} = 2 \\times \\frac{L}{2} = L.\n$$\nThus, the total number of Okazaki fragments (and hence primers) on lagging strands is\n$$\nN_{\\text{ok}} = \\frac{L}{l_{ok}}.\n$$\nWith $L = 20400$ and $l_{ok} = 1200$, we have\n$$\nN_{\\text{ok}} = \\frac{20400}{1200} = 17.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the total number of RNA primers required is\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{lead}} + N_{\\text{ok}} = 2 + 17 = 19.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{19}$$", "id": "1506946"}]}
