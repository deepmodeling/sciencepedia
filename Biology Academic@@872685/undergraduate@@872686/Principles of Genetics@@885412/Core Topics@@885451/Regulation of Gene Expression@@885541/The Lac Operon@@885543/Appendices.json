By working through this classic scenario, you will master the crucial concept of *trans*-acting factors and why the wild-type repressor allele, $I^+$, is dominant over the non-functional $I^-$ allele.", "problem": "A molecular biology student is investigating the regulation of the *lac* operon in a specially constructed strain of *Escherichia coli*. This strain is a partial diploid (merozygote), containing a copy of the bacterial chromosome and an F' plasmid which carries a segment of the *lac* operon. The complete genotype of this strain with respect to the *lac* operon is given as:\n\n`chromosome: lacI+ lacP+ lacO+ lacZ- / F' plasmid: lacI- lacP+ lacO+ lacZ+`\n\nHere, the symbols represent the following genetic elements:\n- `lacI`: The gene encoding the lac repressor protein. The `lacI+` allele produces a functional repressor, while the `lacI-` allele produces a non-functional repressor.\n- `lacP`: The promoter site, where RNA polymerase binds.\n- `lacO`: The operator site, where the lac repressor protein binds.\n- `lacZ`: The structural gene encoding the enzyme $\\beta$-galactosidase. The `lacZ+` allele produces a functional enzyme, while the `lacZ-` allele produces a non-functional enzyme.\n\nFor this specific merozygote, all promoter (`lacP+`) and operator (`lacO+`) sites are wild-type and fully functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the production of functional $\\beta$-galactosidase in this bacterial strain?\n\nA. Functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is not produced under any condition because both DNA molecules have a defective component.\nB. Functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced constitutively, meaning its synthesis occurs regardless of the presence or absence of lactose.\nC. Functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced inducibly, meaning its synthesis occurs only when lactose is added to the growth medium.\nD. The system is uninducible; no functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced even in the presence of lactose because the functional repressor permanently shuts down the system.", "solution": "We analyze regulation of the lac operon in a merozygote by applying the principles that lacI encodes a diffusible, trans-acting repressor, while lacP and lacO act in cis on their linked structural genes. A functional lacI allele ($lacI^+$) produces repressor that can diffuse in the cytoplasm and bind to any functional operator ($lacO^+$) regardless of which DNA molecule carries it. The operator and promoter are cis-regulatory sites; here all are wild type ($lacP^+$, $lacO^+$), so both operons are responsive to the repressor and to inducer.\n\nGiven the genotype:\n- Chromosome: $lacI^+\\ lacP^+\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^-$,\n- F' plasmid: $lacI^-\\ lacP^+\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$,\n\nStep 1: Determine repressor status. The chromosome has $lacI^+$, producing functional repressor. The F' plasmid has $lacI^-$, which does not produce functional repressor. Because $lacI$ is trans-acting, the functional repressor from the chromosome will regulate both the chromosomal and plasmid operons by binding their $lacO^+$ sites.\n\nStep 2: Behavior in absence of inducer (no lactose). Functional LacI repressor binds to $lacO^+$ on both operons and prevents RNA polymerase action at $lacP^+$, thereby repressing transcription of lacZYA. Thus, the plasmid $lacZ^+$ is not expressed, and the chromosome $lacZ^-$ cannot make functional enzyme regardless.\n\nStep 3: Behavior in presence of inducer (lactose, via allolactose). Inducer binds to the functional LacI repressor, reducing its affinity for $lacO^+$; the repressor dissociates, and RNA polymerase can initiate transcription at both $lacP^+$ promoters. The chromosomal operon produces a nonfunctional LacZ due to $lacZ^-$, but the plasmid operon produces functional $\\beta$-galactosidase from $lacZ^+$. Therefore, functional enzyme is produced only when inducer is present.\n\nStep 4: Exclude incorrect options.\n- A is incorrect because the plasmid carries $lacZ^+$, and regulation is intact; functional enzyme can be made upon induction.\n- B is incorrect because the presence of a functional trans-acting $lacI^+$ prevents constitutive expression; repression occurs without inducer.\n- D is incorrect because the functional repressor is inducible and does not permanently shut down expression; inducer alleviates repression.\n\nTherefore, functional $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced inducibly in this strain, only when lactose is present.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335670"}, {"introduction": "This next practice [@problem_id:1527391] builds on the merozygote model by introducing a different type of mutation: one that affects a DNA sequence, the operator ($O$), rather than a protein-coding gene. You will analyze a cell containing both a wild-type operator ($O^+$) and a constitutive operator ($O^c$) that cannot bind the repressor. This problem is designed to solidify your understanding of *cis*-acting elements, which only affect the genes on the same DNA strand, and to contrast their behavior with the *trans*-acting repressor protein.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the *lac* operon is a classic system for studying gene regulation. The operon consists of several components: the repressor gene (*lacI*), the promoter (*P*), the operator (*lacO*), and three structural genes, *lacZ*, *lacY*, and *lacA*.\n\nThe function of these components is as follows:\n- *lacI* (*I*): This gene encodes the *lac* repressor protein. The wild-type allele, `$I^+$`, produces a functional repressor that can bind to the operator.\n- *lacO* (*O*): This is a DNA sequence that acts as the binding site for the repressor protein. The wild-type operator, `$O^+$`, can be bound by the repressor. A constitutive mutant operator, `$O^c$`, has a sequence change that prevents the repressor from binding to it. The operator is a *cis*-acting element, meaning it only affects the transcription of genes on the same DNA strand.\n- *lacZ* (*Z*): This gene encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase. The wild-type allele, `$Z^+$`, produces a functional enzyme.\n- *lacY* (*Y*): This gene encodes the enzyme lactose permease. The wild-type allele, `$Y^+$`, produces a functional enzyme.\n\nThrough bacterial conjugation, it is possible to create a partial diploid cell, also known as a merozygote, which contains the bacterial chromosome and a separate piece of DNA called an F' plasmid.\n\nConsider a merozygote with the following genotype:\n`I^+ O^+ Z^+ Y^- / I^+ O^c Z^- Y^+`\n\nWhich of the following describes the synthesis of functional enzymes in this cell when it is grown in a medium that **lacks** lactose (the inducer)?\n\nA. Functional β-galactosidase will be synthesized, but functional permease will not.\nB. Functional permease will be synthesized, but functional β-galactosidase will not.\nC. Both functional β-galactosidase and functional permease will be synthesized.\nD. Neither functional β-galactosidase nor functional permease will be synthesized.", "solution": "The key regulatory properties of the lac system are:\n- $I^{+}$ encodes a functional repressor that acts in trans. In the absence of inducer (lactose), the repressor binds to $O^{+}$ and blocks transcription.\n- $O$ is a cis-acting DNA site. The mutant $O^{c}$ cannot bind the repressor, so the structural genes downstream on the same DNA are transcribed constitutively regardless of the presence of repressor.\n\nIn the merozygote `I^+ O^+ Z^+ Y^- / I^+ O^c Z^- Y^+` grown without lactose, the repressor made from either $I^{+}$ allele is active and will bind to any $O^{+}$ operator, repressing transcription from that operon. Thus, on the `I^+ O^+ Z^+ Y^-` chromosome, $O^{+}$ is occupied by repressor, so $Z$ and $Y$ are not transcribed; therefore, no beta-galactosidase or permease is produced from this copy (and even if transcribed, $Y^{-}$ cannot produce functional permease).\n\nOn the `I^+ O^c Z^- Y^+` F' plasmid, $O^{c}$ cannot bind the repressor, so transcription is constitutive. This yields expression of $Z^{-}$ (nonfunctional beta-galactosidase) and $Y^{+}$ (functional permease). Therefore, functional permease is synthesized from this operon, while functional beta-galactosidase is not.\n\nHence, in the absence of lactose, functional permease will be synthesized, but functional beta-galactosidase will not.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1527391"}, {"introduction": "Moving from predicting phenotypes to applying your knowledge, this final problem [@problem_id:1527402] puts you in the role of an experimental geneticist. Faced with a hypothetical scenario involving a toxic compound, you must design a positive selection strategy to isolate specific regulatory mutants from a vast population of bacteria. This exercise challenges you to think critically about how the principles of the *lac* operon's regulation can be exploited to achieve a specific experimental goal, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.", "problem": "A team of geneticists is studying spontaneous mutations affecting the regulation of the *lac* operon in *Escherichia coli*. They have synthesized a novel compound called Phenyl-beta-D-toxic-galactoside (PBTG). This compound has two key properties: (1) it can freely diffuse across the bacterial cell membrane without the need for a transporter protein, and (2) it is lethal to the cell unless it is enzymatically cleaved by functional beta-galactosidase, the protein product of the *lacZ* gene. Cleavage by beta-galactosidase renders PBTG completely harmless.\n\nThe researchers start with a pure culture of wild-type *E. coli* of genotype `I+O+Z+`. They grow this culture to a total population of $1.0 \\times 10^{10}$ cells. This large population is then spread evenly onto a single minimal medium agar plate. The sole carbon source provided in the agar is glycerol, and the plate also contains a lethal concentration of PBTG. The plate does not contain any lactose or other inducers.\n\nAssume the following forward mutation rates per cell for the relevant genetic loci:\n- Gene for the Lac repressor ($I^+ \\rightarrow I^-$, where $I^-$ produces a non-functional repressor that cannot bind DNA): $\\mu_{I^-} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-8}$\n- The *lac* operator sequence ($O^+ \\rightarrow O^c$, where $O^c$ cannot be bound by the repressor): $\\mu_{O^c} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}$\n- Gene for the Lac repressor ($I^+ \\rightarrow I^s$, where $I^s$ produces a \"super-repressor\" that cannot bind inducer): $\\mu_{I^s} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-9}$\n- Gene for beta-galactosidase ($Z^+ \\rightarrow Z^-$, where $Z^-$ produces a non-functional enzyme): $\\mu_{Z^-} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nAfter a suitable incubation period, only cells with specific mutations will be able to form colonies.

There is no inducer present, and PBTG is not specified to be an inducer. Therefore, only genotypes that express lacZ constitutively and retain a functional $Z^{+}$ allele will survive. The relevant single-locus mutants are:\n- $I^{-}$: nonfunctional repressor; lac operon is derepressed and lacZ is expressed without inducer.\n- $O^{c}$: operator-constitutive; repressor cannot bind; lacZ is expressed without inducer.\nGenotypes $I^{+}O^{+}Z^{+}$ (wild type) and $I^{s}$ (super-repressor) do not express lacZ without inducer and thus cannot detoxify PBTG; they die. Mutants with $Z^{-}$ cannot cleave PBTG and die even if $I^{-}$ or $O^{c}$ is present. Because PBTG diffuses freely, LacY status is irrelevant.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of cells plated.
