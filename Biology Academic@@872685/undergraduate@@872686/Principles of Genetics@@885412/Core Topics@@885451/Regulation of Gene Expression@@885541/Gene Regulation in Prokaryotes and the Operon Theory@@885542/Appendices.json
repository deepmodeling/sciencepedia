By interpreting the outcome of this hypothetical experiment [@problem_id:1491405], you will learn to deduce the nature of a regulatory component, a critical skill for dissecting any genetic circuit.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying a hypothetical bacterial operon, the *xyl* operon, which is responsible for the catabolism of the sugar xylose. The operon consists of a regulatory gene, *xylR*, which codes for a repressor protein, and a polycistronic structural region containing the gene *xylA* for the enzyme xylosidase. In wild-type *E. coli*, the *xyl* operon is inducible: the *xylA* gene is expressed only in the presence of xylose, which acts as an inducer by inactivating the repressor.\n\nThe researcher isolates a mutant strain, designated `M1`, which exhibits constitutive expression of xylosidase, meaning the enzyme is produced regardless of whether xylose is present in the medium. To determine the nature of this mutation, the researcher performs a complementation test by introducing an F' plasmid into the `M1` strain. This creates a merozygote, a partially diploid bacterium. The F' plasmid carries a complete, wild-type version of the *xyl* operon and its regulatory gene. The genotype of the plasmid can be denoted as `F'(xylR+ xylA+)`.\n\nAfter successfully creating the merozygote strain, the researcher observes its phenotype. It is found that the merozygote strain exhibits inducible expression of xylosidase, just like the wild-type strain.\n\nBased on this experimental outcome, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the original mutation in the `M1` strain?\n\nA. The mutation affects a cis-acting DNA sequence, and its effect is dominant in the merozygote.\n\nB. The mutation affects a trans-acting protein-coding gene, and the mutant allele is recessive to the wild-type allele.\n\nC. The mutation affects a trans-acting protein-coding gene, and the mutant allele is dominant to the wild-type allele.\n\nD. The mutation affects a cis-acting DNA sequence, and its effect is recessive in the merozygote.\n\nE. The mutation is in the structural gene *xylA*, leading to a conformational change that makes the enzyme permanently active.", "solution": "The *xyl* operon is inducible: in the absence of xylose, the repressor encoded by *xylR* binds the operator and prevents transcription of the structural genes (including *xylA*). In the presence of xylose (inducer), xylose inactivates the repressor, thereby allowing transcription. Thus, in wild type, *xylA* expression is inducible.\n\nThe mutant M1 shows constitutive expression of xylosidase (*xylA* product) regardless of inducer. Constitutive expression in an inducible operon typically arises from either:\n1) A loss-of-function mutation in a trans-acting regulator (e.g., $xylR^-$) that eliminates repression, or\n2) A cis-acting operator mutation ($O^c$) that prevents binding by the repressor, so the operon is always transcribed.\n\nTo distinguish these, a complementation test is performed by introducing an F' plasmid carrying $xylR^+ xylA^+$ into M1, making a merozygote with two copies of the operon and at least one wild-type regulatory allele. We analyze the expected phenotypes under alternative mutation classes:\n\nCase 1 (trans-acting regulator mutation, recessive): If M1 is $xylR^- O^+ xylA^+$ on the chromosome, then introducing F'($xylR^+ O^+ xylA^+$) supplies a functional repressor in trans. The $xylR^+$ protein can diffuse and bind both the chromosomal and F' operators. In the absence of xylose, repression is restored; in the presence of xylose, the inducer inactivates the repressor and transcription occurs. Therefore, the merozygote becomes inducible, matching the observed phenotype.\n\nCase 2 (cis-acting operator mutation): If M1 is $xylR^+ O^c xylA^+$ on the chromosome, then even with F'($xylR^+ O^+ xylA^+$), the chromosomal $O^c$ remains constitutive because cis defects cannot be complemented in trans; the repressor cannot bind the mutant operator. The F' operon would be inducible, but the chromosomal operon would be constitutive. Overall, xylosidase would be produced even without inducer, so the merozygote would appear constitutive, contrary to observation.\n\nCase 3 (dominant-negative trans-acting regulator): If M1 carried a dominant-negative *xylR* allele that poisons the wild-type repressor (e.g., by forming nonfunctional multimers), the merozygote would remain constitutive despite $xylR^+$ on the F', again contrary to observation.\n\nCase 4 (structural gene mutation in *xylA* making enzyme “permanently active”): The experimental readout concerns expression (production) of xylosidase, not merely catalytic activity. A structural mutation making the enzyme catalytically hyperactive would not explain the regulation of expression becoming inducible in the merozygote; moreover, F'($xylR^+ xylA^+$) would not convert a constitutive expression phenotype to inducible if the original cause were in *xylA*'s catalytic properties.\n\nBecause the merozygote is inducible, only Case 1 is consistent with the data: the original mutation is in a trans-acting protein-coding gene (*xylR*), and the mutant allele is recessive to the wild-type allele, which complements in trans to restore inducible regulation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the mutation affects a trans-acting protein-coding gene and the mutant allele is recessive to the wild-type allele.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1491405"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of `cis` and `trans` regulation, we can predict the behavior of more complex genetic systems.

Solving this puzzle requires carefully integrating the roles of the promoter, operator, repressor, and structural genes to determine the final phenotype, sharpening your ability to deconstruct and understand multifaceted regulatory networks.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the *lac* operon is a classic system for gene regulation.

The $I^{S}$ allele encodes a super-repressor that cannot bind inducer but can bind a wild-type operator $O^{+}$; it is dominant over $I^{+}$ in trans. Operators act in cis: $O^{c}$ does not bind any repressor and therefore drives constitutive transcription of its linked operon if the promoter is functional. Promoters act in cis: $P^{-}$ prevents RNA polymerase binding and abolishes transcription from that operon regardless of operator or repressor.\n\nDetermine the source of functional $\\beta$-galactosidase. The only functional $Z$ allele is $Z^{+}$ on the chromosome, but it is linked to $P^{-}$, so no transcription occurs from that operon under any condition. The plasmid carries $Z^{-}$, which is nonfunctional even though $P^{+}$ and $O^{c}$ would drive transcription. Therefore, there is no synthesis of functional $\\beta$-galactosidase in either the absence or presence of lactose.\n\nDetermine the source of functional permease. The only functional $Y$ allele is $Y^{+}$ on the plasmid, which is linked to $P^{+}$ and $O^{c}$. Because $O^{c}$ prevents any repressor (including $I^{S}$) from binding, the linked operon is transcribed constitutively when the promoter is intact. Thus functional permease is synthesized constitutively.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is: $\\beta$-galactosidase: no synthesis; permease: constitutive, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1491415"}, {"introduction": "Gene regulation in prokaryotes can be remarkably sophisticated, extending beyond simple on/off switches. This exercise delves into attenuation in the *trp* operon, an elegant mechanism that fine-tunes gene expression by coupling the processes of transcription and translation. By analyzing a mutation that alters the leader peptide sequence [@problem_id:1491423], you will explore how the cell uses the ribosome as a sensor to gauge amino acid availability and adjust its biosynthetic output accordingly.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon. This operon is subject to two layers of control: repression by the TrpR protein and a fine-tuning mechanism known as attenuation. Attenuation depends on the coupled transcription and translation of a leader sequence, *trpL*, located between the promoter and the first structural gene, *trpE*.\n\nThe *trpL* messenger RNA (mRNA) contains a short open reading frame that codes for a 14-amino-acid leader peptide. Crucially, this peptide sequence contains two adjacent tryptophan codons. The secondary structure of the *trpL* mRNA determines whether transcription continues into the structural genes (*trpE-A*) or terminates prematurely.\n\nUnder conditions of severe tryptophan starvation, the *TrpR* repressor is inactive. In a wild-type cell under these conditions, the ribosome stalls at the tryptophan codons in *trpL* due to a scarcity of charged tryptophan-tRNA, leading to a high level of expression of the structural genes. We define this maximal expression level as 100 relative units.\n\nConversely, in a wild-type cell with an excess of tryptophan, the ribosome translates the leader peptide without stalling. This leads to the formation of a terminator hairpin structure in the mRNA, causing transcription to terminate. This basal, attenuated level of expression is 10 relative units.\n\nNow, consider a mutant strain of *E. coli* where the two adjacent tryptophan codons in the *trpL* gene have been genetically engineered to be replaced by two codons for alanine. Assume that the intracellular concentration of alanine and its corresponding charged tRNA are always abundant, regardless of the tryptophan levels in the cell.\n\nCalculate the expected expression level of the *trp* structural genes (*trpE-A*) in this mutant strain when it is grown under conditions of severe tryptophan starvation. Express your answer in relative units.", "solution": "The control logic of the trp operon via attenuation depends on whether the ribosome stalls at the two adjacent tryptophan codons in the leader peptide of *trpL*. The relevant mechanistic outcomes are:\n- If the ribosome stalls at the tryptophan codons (scarcity of charged Trp-tRNA), it favors the formation of the anti-terminator (region 2–3 pairing), preventing the terminator (region 3–4) from forming. Transcription proceeds into *trpE-A*, yielding a high expression level defined as $100$ relative units.\n- If the ribosome does not stall (abundant charged Trp-tRNA), it allows formation of the terminator hairpin (region 3–4), leading to premature transcription termination and a low expression level defined as $10$ relative units.\n\nIn the mutant where the two tryptophan codons in *trpL* are replaced by two alanine codons, and alanine and its charged tRNA are always abundant, the ribosome will not stall at those positions regardless of cellular tryptophan levels. Therefore, during severe tryptophan starvation, although the TrpR repressor is inactive, translation of the leader proceeds without stalling, promoting the formation of the terminator hairpin and causing attenuation.\n\nDefine $E_{\\text{max}}=100$ as the non-attenuated expression (stalling case) and $E_{\\text{att}}=10$ as the attenuated expression (no-stalling case). For the mutant under severe tryptophan starvation, the no-stalling condition applies, so\n$$\nE_{\\text{mutant, starvation}}=E_{\\text{att}}=10.\n$$\nThus, the expected expression level of *trpE-A* in the mutant under severe tryptophan starvation is $10$ relative units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1491423"}]}
