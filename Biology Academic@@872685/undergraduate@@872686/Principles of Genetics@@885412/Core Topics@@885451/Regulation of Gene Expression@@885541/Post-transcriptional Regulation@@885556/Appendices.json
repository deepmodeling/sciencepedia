This problem places you in the role of an experimentalist who has created a knockout mouse. Your task is to select the most direct and rigorous molecular technique to confirm that the genetic modification has successfully eliminated the intended microRNA, a fundamental skill in experimental design and data interpretation. [@problem_id:1512210]", "problem": "A team of geneticists is studying a newly discovered microRNA, designated `miR-Z`, which is believed to play a role in neuronal development. Based on computational predictions, `miR-Z` is thought to regulate the expression of the gene `NeuroFactor`, which codes for a critical growth protein in neurons. The proposed mechanism is that `miR-Z` binds to the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the `NeuroFactor` gene, leading to the degradation of this mRNA and thus reducing the amount of NeuroFactor protein produced.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the scientists have generated a knockout mouse model in which the gene that codes for `miR-Z` has been completely deleted from the genome. Their first step is to confirm that the genetic modification was successful in eliminating the production of the functional miRNA molecule. They plan to compare brain tissue from the knockout mice with brain tissue from wild-type (non-modified) mice.\n\nWhich of the following experimental procedures provides the most direct test for the absence of the mature `miR-Z` molecule in the knockout mice?\n\nA. Using a Western blot to measure the concentration of the NeuroFactor protein.\n\nB. Performing a Southern blot to analyze the structure of the `NeuroFactor` gene in the genome.\n\nC.

The variable of interest is the small, mature miRNA species itself, not downstream targets or genomic context.\n\nPrinciples:\n1) Mature microRNAs are short RNA molecules that can be detected directly by methods that resolve small RNAs and/or use sequence-specific probes or primers. The canonical direct assays are Northern blot for small RNAs and miRNA-specific qRT-PCR (commonly using stem-loop reverse transcription primers) designed to the mature miRNA sequence.\n2) Assays that measure protein or mRNA levels of a putative target are indirect and can be confounded by compensatory regulation, redundancy, or network effects.\n3) Assays aimed at DNA (e.g., Southern blot of a target gene) do not measure miRNA presence.\n4) Whole-genome sequencing is not a direct assay of miRNA abundance; it interrogates DNA sequence and is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate absence of the small RNA species.\n\nEvaluation of options:\nA) Western blot for NeuroFactor protein is an indirect readout of miR-Z function and can be influenced by multiple regulatory mechanisms. It does not directly test for the presence or absence of miR-Z.\nB) Southern blot of the NeuroFactor gene examines genomic DNA structure of a target gene, unrelated to detecting a small RNA. It is not a test of miR-Z presence.\nC) qRT-PCR for NeuroFactor mRNA measures a downstream target transcript and is therefore indirect. Absence of effect on the target mRNA would not prove presence or absence of miR-Z, and changes in the target could arise from other pathways.\nD) Northern blot for small RNAs using a probe complementary to the mature miR-Z sequence directly detects the mature miRNA by size and sequence, and miRNA-specific qRT-PCR with primers targeting the mature miR-Z sequence directly quantifies the mature miRNA. This is the most direct test for absence of mature miR-Z.\nE) Whole-genome sequencing looks for DNA variants/off-target edits and does not directly assess the expression or presence of miR-Z RNA.\n\nConclusion: The most direct test for absence of the mature miR-Z molecule is a Northern blot for the mature miRNA or a miRNA-specific qRT-PCR targeting the mature miR-Z sequence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1512210"}, {"introduction": "Establishing a direct link between a regulatory molecule and its target is a cornerstone of molecular genetics. This practice introduces the luciferase reporter assay, an elegant and widely used method to test such interactions. By analyzing the results of a cleverly designed experiment involving wild-type and mutated sequences, you will learn how researchers can visualize and confirm that a specific microRNA binds directly to the messenger RNA of a target gene to control its expression. [@problem_id:1512164]", "problem": "A molecular biology team is investigating whether a specific microRNA (miRNA), designated as miR-X, plays a role in regulating the expression of a newly discovered protein, Protein-Z. The primary hypothesis is that miR-X directly binds to a recognition sequence within the 3' Untranslated Region (3' UTR) of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes for Protein-Z, leading to the inhibition of its translation.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the team designs a luciferase reporter assay. They create two distinct reporter plasmids:\n1.  **Plasmid WT:** Contains the firefly luciferase gene followed by the complete, wild-type 3' UTR sequence from the Gene-Z mRNA.\n2.  **Plasmid MUT:** Contains the firefly luciferase gene followed by a modified version of the Gene-Z 3' UTR, in which the 7-nucleotide sequence predicted to be the binding site for miR-X has been specifically mutated.\n\nThey perform two parallel experiments by transfecting cultured human cells:\n-   **Experiment A:** Cells are co-transfected with **Plasmid WT** and a synthetic **miR-X** molecule.\n-   **Experiment B:** Cells are co-transfected with **Plasmid MUT** and the same synthetic **miR-X** molecule.\n\nAfter allowing time for gene expression, the researchers measure the luminescence produced by the firefly luciferase in both sets of cells. Assuming the experimental hypothesis is correct, what is the expected outcome?\n\nA. Luciferase activity in Experiment A will be significantly higher than in Experiment B.\n\nB. Luciferase activity in Experiment A will be significantly lower than in Experiment B.\n\nC. Luciferase activity will be approximately equal in both experiments.\n\nD. Luciferase activity will be completely abolished in both experiments.\n\nE. The outcome cannot be predicted without also measuring the levels of Protein-Z in the cells.", "solution": "Principle: MicroRNAs typically downregulate gene expression by base-pairing with complementary sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs, leading to translational inhibition and/or mRNA destabilization. In a luciferase reporter assay, placing a target 3' UTR downstream of the luciferase coding sequence allows any microRNA-mediated repression acting through that UTR to be reflected as a decrease in luciferase activity.\n\nLogical steps:\n1. In Experiment A, Plasmid WT includes the wild-type Gene-Z 3' UTR that contains the predicted miR-X binding site. Upon co-transfection with miR-X, miR-X is expected to bind this site, recruiting the silencing machinery and reducing translation of the luciferase mRNA, resulting in reduced luminescence.\n2. In Experiment B, Plasmid MUT contains a specific mutation in the 7-nucleotide miR-X recognition sequence. This mutation is designed to disrupt base-pairing with miR-X. Therefore, miR-X should not effectively bind, and the repression observed in Experiment A should be relieved, leading to higher luciferase activity relative to Experiment A.\n3. Complete abolition of luciferase signal is not expected because microRNA-mediated repression is typically partial, not absolute, and because the mutation specifically targets one site rather than all potential regulatory elements.\n4. The luciferase reporter directly tests the regulatory effect of miR-X via the 3' UTR; thus, observing differential luciferase activity between WT and MUT constructs in the presence of miR-X is sufficient to infer direct regulatory interaction at that site. Measuring Protein-Z levels is not required to predict the outcome of this assay.\n\nConclusion: If the hypothesis is correct, luciferase activity will be significantly lower in Experiment A than in Experiment B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1512164"}, {"introduction": "MicroRNAs can regulate genes through two primary mechanisms: by triggering the degradation of messenger RNA or by blocking its translation into protein. This exercise challenges you to move beyond qualitative observation to quantitative analysis. Using realistic data from two common molecular assays, you will calculate a 'Translational Repression Factor' ($F_{TR}$) to dissect and quantify the specific repressive strategy a microRNA employs for a given target.

The researcher hypothesizes that miR-744 regulates its target genes through distinct mechanisms: primarily through translational repression for one gene, which we will call `TARG1`, and primarily through messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation for another, `TARG2`.\n\nTo test this, two parallel experiments are conducted comparing control cells with cells engineered to overexpress miR-744.\n\n**Experiment 1: Protein Expression Analysis**\nTo measure the effect on protein production from `TARG1`, a reporter plasmid was constructed where the firefly luciferase gene is fused to the 3' Untranslated Region (UTR) of `TARG1`. This plasmid was transfected into both cell types. The resulting luciferase activity (a proxy for the rate of protein synthesis) in the miR-744 overexpressing cells was measured to be 14.5% of the activity observed in the control cells.\n\n**Experiment 2: mRNA Abundance Analysis**\nThe relative abundance of `TARG1` and `TARG2` transcripts was measured using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). A well-established housekeeping gene, `HKG`, whose expression is not affected by miR-744, was used for normalization. The average Cycle threshold (Ct) values from the qPCR analysis are given below:\n\n| Gene    | Ct in Control Cells | Ct in miR-744 Cells |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| `HKG`   | 20.5                | 20.5                |\n| `TARG1` | 24.2                | 25.2                |\n| `TARG2` | 23.8                | 26.8                |\n\nThe relative mRNA fold-change between the treated and control samples is calculated using the $\\Delta\\Delta C_t$ method, where the fold-change is equal to $2^{-\\Delta\\Delta C_t}$.

We can define a 'Translational Repression Factor' ($F_{TR}$) that quantifies the latter effect. It is the ratio of the total protein fold-change to the mRNA fold-change:\n$$F_{TR} = \\frac{\\text{Protein Fold-Change}}{\\text{mRNA Fold-Change}}$$\nA value of $F_{TR} = 1$ implies no change in translational efficiency, whereas a value less than 1 indicates that translation is being repressed.\n\nUsing the provided experimental data, calculate the Translational Repression Factor, $F_{TR}$, for the gene `TARG1`.
