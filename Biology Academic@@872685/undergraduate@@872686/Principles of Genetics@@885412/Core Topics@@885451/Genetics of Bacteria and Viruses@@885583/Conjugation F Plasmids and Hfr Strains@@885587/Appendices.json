This predictability is governed by two key factors: the site where the F factor integrates into the chromosome and its orientation. This exercise challenges you to visualize the bacterial chromosome as a circular map and the Hfr transfer process as reading this map from a specific point in a specific direction. By working through this hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:1478916], you will master the fundamental principle of how gene transfer order is determined.", "problem": "In bacterial genetics, a High-frequency recombination (Hfr) strain is a bacterium with a conjugative plasmid, known as the Fertility factor (F factor), integrated into its main circular chromosome. During conjugation, the Hfr cell can transfer its chromosome to a recipient (F-) cell, starting from a specific point called the origin of transfer (oriT) located within the integrated F factor.\n\nAn *E. coli* chromosome is known to contain a set of genes in the following clockwise circular order: `... → *proC* → *leuA* → *argB* → *hisG* → *metE* → ...`, where each symbol represents a gene locus.\n\nA researcher isolates an Hfr strain, designated `Hfr-1`. Through an interrupted mating experiment with an F- recipient that is auxotrophic for all five markers, the researcher determines that the first three genes transferred from `Hfr-1` are, in order, `*proC*`, `*leuA*`, and `*argB*`.\n\nSubsequently, a second strain, `Hfr-2`, is isolated. Genetic mapping reveals that the F factor in `Hfr-2` is integrated at the exact same chromosomal locus as in `Hfr-1`, but with the opposite orientation.\n\nWhat will be the predicted order of the first three genes transferred from the `Hfr-2` strain to an F- recipient?\n\nA. `*proC* → *leuA* → *argB*`\nB. `*metE* → *hisG* → *argB*`\nC. `*argB* → *leuA* → *proC*`\nD. `*metE* → *proC* → *leuA*`\nE. `*argB* → *hisG* → *metE*`", "solution": "The key physical principle is that in an Hfr strain, chromosomal DNA transfer starts at the origin of transfer (oriT) within the integrated F factor and proceeds in a direction determined by the orientation of the integrated F element. Reversing the orientation reverses the direction of transfer along the chromosome while keeping the integration site the same.\n\nGiven the known clockwise gene order on the circular chromosome: *proC* → *leuA* → *argB* → *hisG* → *metE*.\n\nFrom the interrupted mating with Hfr-1, the first three transferred genes are *proC*, *leuA*, *argB*. This implies that for Hfr-1 the transfer direction across these markers is clockwise, encountering *proC* first among the five markers, then *leuA*, then *argB*.\n\nFor Hfr-2, the F factor is integrated at the same locus but with the opposite orientation, so the transfer direction is reversed relative to Hfr-1. Therefore, among these five markers, the earliest encountered in the reverse (counterclockwise) direction will follow the reverse order of the listed clockwise sequence, namely *metE* first, then *hisG*, then *argB*.\n\nThus, the predicted order of the first three markers transferred from Hfr-2 is *metE* → *hisG* → *argB*, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1478916"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, this problem simulates the challenge of designing a real-world laboratory experiment.

Therefore, adding streptomycin to the plating medium will kill $\\text{str}^{\\text{S}}$ donors and allow only $\\text{str}^{\\text{R}}$ recipients (including exconjugants) to grow.

While conjugation is typically interrupted before the entire chromosome is transferred, this problem asks you to consider the outcome of a rare, complete transfer event [@problem_id:1478889]. Solving this requires a deep understanding of how the F factor is structured within the Hfr chromosome and the sequence of events during transfer. It elegantly explains why the recipient cell normally remains F-, and what specific conditions are required for it to acquire the Hfr status itself.", "problem": "In a genetics laboratory, researchers are investigating the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer in *Escherichia coli*. They use a specific donor strain that is characterized as a High-frequency of recombination (Hfr) cell, which has its Fertility factor (F-factor) integrated directly into its main bacterial chromosome. The recipient strain is F-, meaning it lacks the F-factor and cannot initiate conjugation.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the conjugation process between an Hfr and an F- cell is a fragile process, and the mating bridge typically breaks before the entire donor chromosome can be transferred. Consequently, the recipient usually acquires some chromosomal genes from the donor but does not receive the complete F-factor, thus remaining F-.\n\nIn a particular experiment, the researchers implement a novel protocol that successfully stabilizes the conjugation bridge, allowing for the extremely rare event of a complete, uninterrupted transfer of the entire Hfr donor chromosome into the F- recipient cell.\n\nAssuming this complete linear donor chromosome enters the recipient cell and subsequent homologous recombination events occur to integrate the new genetic material, which of the following describes the most probable final genetic status of the recipient cell with respect to the F-factor?\n\nA.

The recipient cell becomes an F+ cell.\nE. The recipient cell becomes an Hfr cell.", "solution": "We use foundational principles of bacterial conjugation and recombination.\n\n1) Definitions and setup:\n- An Hfr cell has the F-factor integrated into its chromosome via homologous recombination at shared insertion sequences. The origin of transfer, oriT, lies within the integrated F DNA.\n- An F- cell lacks the F-factor and cannot initiate conjugation.\n- During Hfr-to-F- conjugation, transfer begins at oriT inside the integrated F sequence and proceeds linearly: an initial segment of F DNA is transferred first, followed by donor chromosomal genes, and only at the very end of a complete transfer does the remaining segment of the F sequence arrive.\n\n2) Usual outcome under interrupted transfer:\n- Because mating bridges normally break early, the recipient acquires some donor chromosomal genes but almost never the complete F sequence; thus, it remains F-. This is due to incomplete transfer that fails to deliver both halves of the integrated F-factor.\n\n3) Novel protocol with complete transfer:\n- By stabilizing the mating bridge, the entire linear copy of the Hfr donor chromosome can enter the F- recipient, including both halves of the integrated F sequence. After entry, the incoming DNA is converted to double-stranded form and subjected to homologous recombination with the recipient chromosome.\n- Homologous recombination occurs at regions of sequence identity between donor and recipient chromosomes. The recipient lacks an autonomous F plasmid, so the F-specific sequences themselves lack direct homology in the recipient; however, the flanking chromosomal regions do have homology, enabling recombination events that can replace the corresponding regions in the recipient chromosome with donor segments that include the integrated F.\n\n4) Most probable genetic status after recombination:\n- If the entire donor chromosome is available for recombination, the recipient’s chromosome can be largely or entirely replaced by donor sequences through multiple crossovers. Critically, this replacement can include the locus at which the F-factor is integrated in the donor, yielding a recipient whose chromosome now contains an integrated F-factor. This recreates the Hfr configuration in the recipient.\n- Becoming F+ would require the F-factor to be excised from the chromosome as an autonomous circular plasmid, which is not the default consequence of conjugation-mediated chromosomal transfer and recombination. Such excision events are special and less probable. Similarly, formation of an F' (F-prime) plasmid requires imprecise excision capturing chromosomal genes, which is even less likely given the described process. Cell death from receiving a second chromosome is not the expected outcome because the linear donor DNA is not maintained as a separate replicon; instead, recombination integrates segments and the non-integrated donor DNA is degraded.\n\nTherefore, after complete chromosomal transfer and recombination, the most probable final status of the recipient with respect to the F-factor is that it becomes Hfr (i.e., it acquires the donor’s integrated F configuration).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1478889"}]}
