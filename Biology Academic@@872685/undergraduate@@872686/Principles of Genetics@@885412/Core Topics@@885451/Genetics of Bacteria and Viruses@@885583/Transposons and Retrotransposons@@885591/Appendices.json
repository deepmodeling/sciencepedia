MITEs are a specific type of non-autonomous Class II transposable element, meaning they rely on the enzymatic machinery of other, autonomous elements to move within the genome. Your algorithm will scan raw DNA sequences to locate potential MITE candidates based on their conserved structural features.\n\nWhich of the following structural characteristics or sequence features must your algorithm be programmed to search for simultaneously to correctly identify a potential MITE?

The presence of Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs), which are several hundred base pairs long and in the same orientation.", "solution": "We begin from the defining biology of Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs). MITEs are non-autonomous DNA transposons (Class II), which implies: they do not encode their own transposase, they move via a DNA cut-and-paste mechanism mediated by the transposase of an autonomous partner, and they exhibit characteristic structural hallmarks of DNA transposons. The canonical, conserved features used for de novo identification are:\n- A compact size, typically tens to a few hundred base pairs, reflecting their “miniature” designation.\n- Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) at the element ends, which are near-perfect reverse complements of one another and are recognized by the cognate transposase.\n- Short Target Site Duplications (TSDs), which are direct repeats of host DNA generated upon insertion; their length is usually a few base pairs and depends on the transposase superfamily.\n\nWe evaluate each option against these requirements:\n- Option A: An overall element length typically between 50 and 600 base pairs. This matches the known size range for MITEs used in de novo discovery pipelines and is a standard screening criterion. Thus A is required.\n- Option B: Terminal Inverted Repeats that are nearly perfect reverse complements at the ends. TIRs are a defining structural feature of DNA transposons, including MITEs, and are essential for recognition by transposase. Thus B is required.\n- Option C: Short, direct TSDs immediately flanking both ends, typically 2 to 10 base pairs. TSDs are produced during transposase-mediated insertion and are routinely used in computational identification because they validate genuine insertion boundaries. Thus C is required.\n- Option D: An internal coding sequence for a functional transposase enzyme. MITEs are non-autonomous and do not encode transposase. Thus D must be excluded.\n- Option E: An internal coding sequence for a functional reverse transcriptase enzyme. Reverse transcriptase is characteristic of retrotransposons (Class I), not DNA transposons. MITEs are Class II and lack reverse transcriptase. Thus E must be excluded.\n- Option F: Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs). LTRs are features of LTR retrotransposons, not DNA transposons. MITEs do not have LTRs. Thus F must be excluded.\n\nTherefore, the features that must be searched for simultaneously to correctly identify a potential MITE are the compact element length, the presence of TIRs, and the flanking TSDs, corresponding to A, B, and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "1533113"}, {"introduction": "A transposable element's ability to move is not a simple act but a highly specific molecular event, akin to a key (the transposase enzyme) fitting a specific lock (the terminal repeats). This problem explores the critical relationship between a transposase and its cognate DNA binding sites. By examining a hypothetical complementation experiment, you will deduce the rules governing transposon mobility and why enzymes from one element typically cannot mobilize another. [@problem_id:1533095]", "problem": "A molecular geneticist is studying a novel Insertion Sequence (IS) element, named IS*101*, found in the chromosome of a bacterium. A wild-type IS*101* element is 1200 base pairs long and contains a single functional gene encoding a transposase enzyme. This gene is flanked by two identical 25-base-pair DNA sequences known as Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs), which are essential for its mobility.\n\nThe geneticist isolates a mutant strain of the bacterium in which the IS*101* element, now designated $IS101^{mut}$, is completely immobile. DNA sequencing reveals that the transposase gene within $IS101^{mut}$ is intact and fully functional. However, one of the two TIRs has a 15-base-pair deletion that completely abolishes its function, while the other TIR remains perfectly intact.\n\nTo investigate this phenomenon, the geneticist introduces a multi-copy plasmid into the mutant bacterial strain. This plasmid carries a different, well-characterized IS element, IS*50*. The IS*50* element is fully functional, possessing its own active transposase gene and its own two functional TIRs. The DNA sequence of the IS*50* TIRs is substantially different from the sequence of the IS*101* TIRs.\n\nAssuming no other mutations occur and that both the chromosomal and plasmid-based transposase genes are expressed, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed in the bacterial culture after several generations?\n\nA. Both $IS101^{mut}$ and IS*50* will transpose to new locations in the genome.\n\nB. Neither $IS101^{mut}$ nor IS*50* will be able to transpose.\n\nC. The $IS101^{mut}$ element will become mobile and transpose, while the IS*50* element will remain on the plasmid.\n\nD. The IS*50* element will transpose to new locations in the genome, while the $IS101^{mut}$ element will remain immobile at its original chromosomal location.\n\nE. The transposase from IS*50* will cause a double-strand break at the single functional TIR of $IS101^{mut}$, leading to the loss of a chromosomal fragment.", "solution": "Transposition by a simple insertion sequence requires both of the following: (i) two functional terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) flanking the element, and (ii) a transposase that specifically recognizes and binds these TIRs to form a synaptic complex. The recognition of TIRs by the transposase is sequence specific; a given transposase typically acts only on its cognate TIR sequences.\n\nIn the mutant element $IS101^{mut}$, one TIR is deleted by 15 base pairs in a way that abolishes its function, while the other TIR remains intact. Even though the IS101 transposase gene is intact and expressed, the absence of a second functional TIR prevents assembly of the paired-end synaptic complex. Therefore, $IS101^{mut}$ cannot transpose in cis because two ends are required for the canonical cut-and-paste reaction.\n\nIntroduction of a plasmid carrying IS50 provides an additional, fully functional transposase and its own pair of matched TIRs. However, the IS50 transposase recognizes the IS50 TIR sequences with high specificity, and the IS50 TIR sequences are substantially different from the IS101 TIRs. Consequently, the IS50 transposase will not complement the defective $IS101^{mut}$ in trans, because it cannot recognize or synapse the IS101 TIRs. Likewise, it will not selectively cleave a single IS101 TIR to produce a double-strand break in the chromosome, because the required sequence-specific binding and coordinated cleavage at both ends of a cognate element are not met by a heterologous TIR.\n\nBy contrast, IS50 on the plasmid possesses both its cognate TIRs and its own active transposase. Therefore, IS50 will be competent to transpose to new genomic locations. There is no basis for IS50 being restricted to the plasmid in the presence of expression, and no reason to expect the immobile $IS101^{mut}$ to regain mobility without restoration of its second TIR or provision of a transposase that recognizes IS101 TIRs.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because $IS101^{mut}$ lacks a functional pair of TIRs and will not be complemented by the heterologous IS50 transposase.\n- B is false because IS50 is fully functional and should transpose.\n- C is false for the same reason as A; $IS101^{mut}$ will not transpose, while IS50 is not restricted to the plasmid.\n- D is correct: IS50 will transpose, and $IS101^{mut}$ will remain immobile.\n- E is unlikely and not the most likely outcome; heterologous transposase does not efficiently act on a single noncognate TIR to cause a chromosomal double-strand break.\n\nThus, the most likely observed outcome is that IS50 transposes while $IS101^{mut}$ remains immobile.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1533095"}, {"introduction": "The life cycle of a 'cut-and-paste' transposon involves excising from one genomic location, but what happens to the spot it leaves behind?

A researcher discovers a strain where a 'cut-and-paste' DNA transposon, named `Voyager-1`, has inserted into this locus. The insertion of `Voyager-1` is known to create a 4-base-pair (bp) Target Site Duplication (TSD). The sequence of `locus-alpha` in this new strain is `5'-AATTCGTAG**GCAT**-[Voyager-1]-**GCAT**GCGTA-3'`, where `[Voyager-1]` represents the several kilobase-long transposon sequence and the bolded `GCAT` sequences are the TSDs.\n\nTo study the repair mechanisms following transposon excision, the researcher establishes two mutant cell lines from this strain and then activates the `Voyager-1` transposase in both.\n-   **Cell Line 1 (CL1):** This line has a null mutation in the gene for RAD51, a protein essential for Homology-Directed Repair (HDR).\n-   **Cell Line 2 (CL2):** This line has a null mutation in the gene for DNA Ligase IV, a protein essential for the final ligation step of Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ).\n\nAfter inducing transposase expression and allowing time for DNA repair, the `locus-alpha` is sequenced from a population of cells from each line.

In the transposon-containing strain, the cut-and-paste DNA transposon Voyager-1 inserted with a 4-bp target site duplication (TSD) of GCAT, yielding 5'-AATTCGTAG GCAT -[Voyager-1]- GCAT GCGTA-3'. This is consistent with the general principle that transposase-mediated staggered cuts at the target site are filled in during insertion, creating short direct repeats (the TSDs) flanking the transposon.\n\nUpon transposase activation, excision of Voyager-1 creates a double-strand break (DSB) at locus-alpha flanked by the duplicated 4-bp sequences. The predominant repair outcome depends on which DSB repair pathway is functional:\n- Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) requires RAD51 for nucleoprotein filament formation and homology search. When HDR uses an intact homologous template (e.g., sister chromatid or homolog), it tends to precisely restore the pre-insertion sequence, removing both copies of the TSD and returning to 5'-AATTCGTAGCATGCGTA-3'.\n- Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), requiring DNA Ligase IV for the final ligation step, directly ligates DNA ends and is characteristically imprecise, frequently producing small insertions or deletions (indels) or retaining one or both TSD copies at the junction (a transposon “footprint”).\n\nAnalyze each cell line:\n1) CL1 (RAD51 null, HDR-deficient; NHEJ intact). With HDR disabled, repair proceeds predominantly via NHEJ. Given the two adjacent GCAT copies at the break, NHEJ commonly introduces small indels at the junction. Among the provided sequences, 5'-AATTCGTAGCTGCGTA-3' reflects an imprecise NHEJ outcome with a small deletion at the junction relative to the wild-type 5'-AATTCGTAGCATGCGTA-3' (the central “A” and possibly flanking bases from the original “CAT” block are lost), which is a canonical NHEJ footprint. Although retaining both TSD copies (5'-...GCATGCAT...-3') is possible if ends are ligated without resection, the pedagogically expected predominant signature for NHEJ, especially in the absence of HDR, is an indel at the repair junction.\n2) CL2 (DNA Ligase IV null, NHEJ-deficient; HDR intact). With classical NHEJ blocked, repair shifts to RAD51-dependent HDR using the homologous template. HDR is accurate and therefore restores the original wild-type sequence 5'-AATTCGTAGCATGCGTA-3' without the TSD footprint.\n\nComparing to the answer choices:\n- Only choice C assigns an NHEJ-type deletion product to CL1 and a precise HDR-restored wild-type sequence to CL2, matching the pathway dependencies described above.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is choice C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1533116"}]}
