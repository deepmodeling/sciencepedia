Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "The problem describes a case of complementary gene action, a type of epistasis where dominant alleles at two different loci are required to produce a specific phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's determine the genotype and phenotype of the F1 generation.\nThe parental (P) cross is between a true-breeding resistant plant ($RRSS$) and a true-breeding susceptible plant ($rrss$).\nThe $RRSS$ parent produces only $RS$ gametes.\nThe $rrss$ parent produces only $rs$ gametes.\nThe resulting F1 generation will therefore all have the genotype $RrSs$.\nTo determine the phenotype of the F1 generation, we check the condition for resistance. A plant is resistant if it has at least one dominant $R$ allele and at least one dominant $S$ allele. The $RrSs$ genotype satisfies this condition, so all F1 plants are resistant to the Shadow Blight.\n\nNext, we analyze the F2 generation, which is produced by self-pollinating the F1 generation ($RrSs \\times RrSs$). This is a standard dihybrid cross. We can determine the proportions of the F2 genotypes by considering the two gene pairs independently, as they are unlinked.\n\nFor the R-locus, the cross is $Rr \\times Rr$. The resulting genotypic ratio is $1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr$. The phenotypic ratio is $3/4$ for plants with at least one dominant allele ($R\\_$) and $1/4$ for homozygous recessive plants ($rr$).\n\nFor the S-locus, the cross is $Ss \\times Ss$. The resulting genotypic ratio is $1 SS : 2 Ss : 1 ss$. The phenotypic ratio is $3/4$ for plants with at least one dominant allele ($S\\_$) and $1/4$ for homozygous recessive plants ($ss$).\n\nA plant is resistant only if it can produce Lunarin, which requires both a functional Enzyme R (genotype $R\\_$) and a functional Enzyme S (genotype $S\\_$). So, the genotype for a resistant plant must be $R\\_ S\\_$. All other genotypes will result in a susceptible plant.\n\nThe proportion of resistant plants in the F2 generation is the probability of an offspring having the $R\\_ S\\_$ genotype. Since the genes are unlinked, we can use the product rule:\n$P(\\text{Resistant}) = P(R\\_) \\times P(S\\_) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$\n\nThe problem asks for the proportion of susceptible plants. Susceptible plants are those that do not produce Lunarin. This includes plants with genotypes $R\\_ ss$, $rr S\\_$, and $rrss$. The total proportion of susceptible plants is the sum of the proportions of these genotypes.\n$P(R\\_ ss) = P(R\\_) \\times P(ss) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$\n$P(rr S\\_) = P(rr) \\times P(S\\_) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$\n$P(rrss) = P(rr) \\times P(ss) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nThe total proportion of susceptible plants is the sum of these probabilities:\n$P(\\text{Susceptible}) = P(R\\_ ss) + P(rr S\\_) + P(rrss) = \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{7}{16}$\n\nAlternatively, since there are only two phenotypes (resistant and susceptible), the proportion of susceptible plants is simply 1 minus the proportion of resistant plants.\n$P(\\text{Susceptible}) = 1 - P(\\text{Resistant}) = 1 - \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} - \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{7}{16}$\n\nThus, the proportion of the F2 generation that is susceptible to the Shadow Blight is $\\frac{7}{16}$.

The two genes are linked on the same chromosome, and the observed phenotypic ratio results from a specific recombination frequency between them.", "solution": "The problem asks us to deduce the genetic interaction between two genes, $A/a$ and $B/b$, based on the results of a series of crosses.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial cross and the F1 generation.**\nThe parental (P) cross is between a pure-breeding blue plant ($AABB$) and a pure-breeding white plant ($aabb$).\nP cross: $AABB$ (Blue) × $aabb$ (White)\nThe F1 generation is the offspring of this cross. The gamete from the first parent is $AB$, and the gamete from the second parent is $ab$.\nF1 genotype: $AaBb$\nThe problem states that all F1 individuals have blue petals. Therefore, the genotype $AaBb$ corresponds to the blue phenotype.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the testcross and its expected progeny.**\nAn F1 individual ($AaBb$) is testcrossed with a homozygous recessive individual ($aabb$).\nTestcross: $AaBb$ × $aabb$\nSince the genes are unlinked, the $AaBb$ parent produces four types of gametes in equal proportions: $AB$, $Ab$, $aB$, and $ab$ (each with a frequency of 1/4). The $aabb$ parent produces only one type of gamete: $ab$.\nThe resulting progeny genotypes will be in the following proportions:\n- `1/4 AaBb`\n- `1/4 Aabb`\n- `1/4 aaBb`\n- `1/4 aabb`\nIf there were no gene interaction (epistasis) and each genotype produced a unique phenotype, we would expect a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the expected genotypic ratio to the observed phenotypic ratio.**\nThe observed phenotypic ratio is 1 blue : 1 yellow : 2 white. This can be written as fractions of the total progeny:\n- `1/4` Blue\n- `1/4` Yellow\n- `2/4` (or `1/2`) White\n\nWe must now map the four equally likely genotypes from Step 2 to these three phenotypes.\n- From Step 1, we know $AaBb$ results in a blue phenotype. This accounts for the `1/4` Blue progeny.\n- This leaves the genotypes $Aabb$, $aaBb$, and $aabb$ to account for the `1/4` Yellow and `2/4` White progeny.\n- To get a `1/4` proportion for the yellow phenotype, it must correspond to a single genotypic class. Let's assign $Aabb$ to the yellow phenotype.\n- This leaves the remaining two genotypes, $aaBb$ and $aabb$, to account for the `2/4` white progeny. This is consistent, as `1/4 aaBb + 1/4 aabb = 2/4` of the progeny. So, both $aaBb$ and $aabb$ must produce the white phenotype.\n\n**Step 4: Deduce the type of gene interaction.**\nLet's summarize our genotype-phenotype map:\n- $AaBb$ -> Blue\n- $Aabb$ -> Yellow\n- $aaBb$ -> White\n- $aabb$ -> White\n\nFrom this mapping, we can see that whenever the genotype is homozygous recessive for the A gene ($aa$), the phenotype is white, regardless of the alleles at the B locus ($B\\_$ or $bb$). This is the definition of **recessive epistasis**, where the recessive genotype at one locus ($aa$) masks the expression of the other locus ($B/b$).\n\nThis interaction can be explained by a biochemical pathway:\n1.  A colorless precursor is converted into a yellow pigment by the enzyme encoded by the dominant allele $A$.\n2.  The yellow pigment is then converted into a blue pigment by the enzyme encoded by the dominant allele $B$.\n- $A\\_B\\_$ (like $AaBb$): Both enzymes are functional. Precursor -> Yellow -> Blue. Phenotype: Blue.\n- $A\\_bb$ (like $Aabb$): Only the first enzyme is functional. Precursor -> Yellow. The second step is blocked. Phenotype: Yellow.\n- $aa\\_\\_$ (like $aaBb$ and $aabb$): The first enzyme is non-functional. The precursor is not converted to yellow. The second enzyme has no yellow substrate to act upon. Phenotype: White.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options.**\n- **A:** States that $aa$ is epistatic to $B/b$, which is exactly what we deduced. It also provides the correct biochemical rationale: Gene A produces a precursor for Gene B. This statement is correct.\n- **B:** Describes dominant epistasis, where a dominant allele $A$ would mask the $B/b$ locus. If this were true, $AaBb$ and $Aabb$ would share the same phenotype, which contradicts the data (one is blue, the other is yellow). This is incorrect.\n- **C:** Describes duplicate recessive epistasis ($9:7$ F2 ratio from a dihybrid cross), where being homozygous recessive at *either* locus ($aa\\_\\_$ or $\\_\\_bb$) gives the same phenotype. This would mean $Aabb$ (due to $bb$) would also be white, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1 Blue : 3 White in the testcross. This is incorrect.\n- **D:** Claims no epistasis. The 1:1:2 ratio clearly indicates a gene interaction is occurring, as it deviates from the expected 1:1:1:1 non-epistatic testcross ratio. Incomplete dominance at one locus would still result in four distinct phenotypic classes if the other gene acts independently (e.g., Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, Green from $AaBb$, $Aabb$, $aaBb$, $aabb$). This is incorrect.\n- **E:** Proposes linkage as the explanation. Linkage alters the frequency of gametes produced by the F1, thus changing the progeny genotypic ratios from 1:1:1:1. However, it does not explain why two different genotypes ($aaBb$ and $aabb$) produce the same phenotype. The collapsing of genotypic classes into a smaller number of phenotypic classes is the result of epistasis. Therefore, epistasis must be involved.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement A provides the only accurate description of the genetic system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1486198"}]}
