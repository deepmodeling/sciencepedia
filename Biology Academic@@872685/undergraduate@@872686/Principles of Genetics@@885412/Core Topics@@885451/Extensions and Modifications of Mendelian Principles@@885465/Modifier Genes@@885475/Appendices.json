This problem demonstrates how a recessive modifier gene can alter the phenotypic expression of a dominant allele at a separate locus. By working through this cross involving tree frog eye color, you will practice predicting phenotypic ratios when a recessive modifier creates a novel phenotype, a classic example of gene interaction. [@problem_id:1503758]", "problem": "In a particular species of tropical tree frog, two independently assorting genes determine eye color. One gene controls the primary pigment, with the allele for red eyes being completely dominant to the allele for yellow eyes. A second gene can modify the expression of the first. When an individual is homozygous recessive for this second gene, the red pigment is transformed, resulting in orange eyes. This modifying effect does not happen in the presence of a dominant allele for the second gene, and it has no effect on individuals that would otherwise have yellow eyes.\n\nA biologist performs a cross between a true-breeding frog with orange eyes and a true-breeding frog with yellow eyes. All of the resulting F1 generation offspring are found to have red eyes. These F1 frogs are then interbred to produce an F2 generation.\n\nWhat fraction of the F2 generation is expected to have orange eyes? Express your answer as a simple fraction.", "solution": "Let the primary pigment gene be $R/r$, where $R$ is dominant for red and $r$ yields yellow when homozygous. Let the modifier gene be $M/m$, where only $mm$ transforms red pigment to orange, has no effect in the presence of $M$, and has no effect when the primary genotype is $rr$ (which is yellow regardless).\n\nThus, the phenotype mapping is:\n- $R\\_\\ M\\_$ gives red,\n- $R\\_\\ mm$ gives orange,\n- $rr$ with any $M/m$ genotype gives yellow.\n\nA true-breeding orange frog must be $RR\\,mm$. A true-breeding yellow frog must be $rr$ with some $M/m$ genotype. The cross produces all F1 red. From $RR\\,mm \\times rr\\,??$, the F1 at the primary locus are all $Rr$. To ensure none are $mm$ (which would give orange), the yellow parent must be $MM$, so that $mm \\times MM \\to$ all $Mm$.

You will analyze how an autosomal modifier gene influences a trait determined by a gene on the X chromosome in fruit flies. This practice is crucial for developing skills in solving multi-faceted inheritance problems where different genetic principles, such as mode of inheritance and location of genes, intersect. [@problem_id:1503770]", "problem": "In a certain species of fruit fly, eye morphology is influenced by two different genes. The first gene is located on the X chromosome and controls the basic texture of the eye surface. The wild-type allele, $X^R$, results in smooth eyes, while a recessive allele, $X^r$, causes a subtle \"rough eye\" phenotype in genotypes $X^rY$ and $X^rX^r$.\n\nA second, independently assorting autosomal gene acts as a modifier. This gene has a dominant allele, $M$, and a recessive allele, $m$. The presence of at least one $M$ allele has no effect on its own. However, in individuals that would otherwise express the subtle rough eye phenotype, the presence of the $M$ allele dramatically enhances the condition, causing the eyes to become completely degenerated. Individuals with genotype $mm$ do not show this enhancement effect.\n\nA pure-breeding female with smooth eyes and the genotype $MM$ for the modifier gene is crossed with a male that has subtle rough eyes and is pure-breeding for the non-modifying allele. The resulting F1 offspring are then intercrossed to produce an F2 generation.\n\nWhat proportion of the F2 males will exhibit degenerated eyes? Express your answer as a fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the proportion of F2 males with degenerated eyes resulting from a specific series of crosses. We must first determine the genotypes of the parental (P), F1, and F2 generations.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Parental (P) Generation Genotypes**\n- The female is \"pure-breeding with smooth eyes and the genotype $MM$\". Since she is pure-breeding and has smooth eyes ($X^R$ is dominant), her genotype for the X-linked gene must be $X^R X^R$. Her full genotype is $X^R X^R; MM$.\n- The male has \"subtle rough eyes and is pure-breeding for the non-modifying allele\". The subtle rough eye phenotype requires the $X^r$ allele, so his X-linked genotype is $X^r Y$. Being pure-breeding for the non-modifying allele ($m$) means his autosomal genotype is $mm$. His full genotype is $X^r Y; mm$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the F1 Generation Genotypes**\nWe cross the P generation: $X^R X^R; MM$ (female) $\\times$ $X^r Y; mm$ (male).\n- The female produces only one type of gamete: $X^R; M$.\n- The male produces two types of gametes in equal proportions: $X^r; m$ and $Y; m$.\n\nThe F1 offspring genotypes are:\n- Females: $(X^R; M) \\times (X^r; m) \\rightarrow X^R X^r; Mm$.\n- Males: $(X^R; M) \\times (Y; m) \\rightarrow X^R Y; Mm$.\n\nBoth F1 males and females are phenotypically wild-type (smooth eyes) because they carry the dominant $X^R$ allele.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the F1 Intercross to Produce the F2 Generation**\nThe F1 generation is intercrossed: $X^R X^r; Mm$ (female) $\\times$ $X^R Y; Mm$ (male).\nSince the genes assort independently, we can analyze the inheritance of the X-linked gene and the autosomal gene separately.\n\n**3a: Analysis of the X-linked gene cross ($X^R X^r \\times X^R Y$)**\nWe can use a Punnett square for this cross:\n| Gametes from female | $X^R$ (from male) | $Y$ (from male) |\n|---|---|---|\n| $X^R$ | $X^R X^R$ | $X^R Y$ |\n| $X^r$ | $X^R X^r$ | $X^r Y$ |\n\nThe F2 offspring genotypes with respect to this gene are produced in the following proportions: $\\frac{1}{4} X^R X^R$, $\\frac{1}{4} X^R X^r$, $\\frac{1}{4} X^R Y$, and $\\frac{1}{4} X^r Y$.\nConsidering only the male offspring, half of them are $X^R Y$ and half are $X^r Y$.\nSo, the probability that an F2 male has the genotype $X^r Y$ is $P(X^r Y) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**3b: Analysis of the autosomal gene cross ($Mm \\times Mm$)**\nA standard monohybrid cross gives the following genotypic ratio:\n- $P(MM) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(Mm) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(mm) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Genotype for the Target Phenotype and Calculate the Proportion**\nThe problem asks for the proportion of F2 males with \"degenerated eyes\".\nAccording to the problem description, the degenerated eye phenotype occurs in individuals that would otherwise be \"subtle rough\" but also carry the dominant modifier allele $M$.\n- The \"subtle rough\" phenotype requires the genotype $X^r Y$ in males.\n- The enhancement requires the presence of at least one $M$ allele, which corresponds to the genotypes $MM$ or $Mm$. We denote this as $M\\_$.\n\nThe probability of an offspring having the $M\\_$ genotype is:\n$P(M\\_) = P(MM) + P(Mm) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nTo find the proportion of F2 males with degenerated eyes, we need to find the fraction of males that have the genotype $X^r Y$ AND the genotype $M\\_$. Since the genes assort independently, we can multiply their probabilities.\n\nProportion of males with degenerated eyes = $P(X^r Y \\text{ among males}) \\times P(M\\_)$\nProportion = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\n\nThus, among all the F2 males produced from this cross, 3/8 are expected to have degenerated eyes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$", "id": "1503770"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice takes the concept of modifier genes from the level of individual crosses to the grand scale of population evolution.

However, this resistance comes at a price: in an environment free of the pesticide, any individual carrying at least one 'R' allele has its relative fitness reduced by a factor $1-s$, where $s$ is a positive constant representing the fitness cost.\n\nAfter a long period of pesticide use, the frequency of the 'R' allele is high. The pesticide is then permanently withdrawn, and the population begins to evolve in response to the fitness cost of the 'R' allele.\n\nSimultaneously, a rare recessive allele 'm' at a second, unlinked genetic locus acts as a modifier. Individuals with the genotype 'mm' have their fitness restored to normal (relative fitness of 1), even if they carry the 'R' allele. The initial frequency of this 'm' allele in the population is $q_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nDepending on the initial frequency of the resistance allele, $p_0$, the population can evolve towards one of two long-term outcomes: the 'R' allele is either purged from the population by selection, or it is 'rescued' by the spread of the 'm' allele and maintained.
