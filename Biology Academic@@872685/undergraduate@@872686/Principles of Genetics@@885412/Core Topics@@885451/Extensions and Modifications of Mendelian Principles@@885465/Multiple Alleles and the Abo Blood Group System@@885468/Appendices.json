By working through a classic cross involving parents with blood types AB and O, you'll directly apply the concepts of codominance between the $I^A$ and $I^B$ alleles and their complete dominance over the $i$ allele. Mastering this basic prediction is the first step toward tackling more complex genetic scenarios. [@problem_id:1505143]", "problem": "In the human ABO blood group system, a single gene with three alleles ($I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$) determines an individual's blood type. The alleles $I^A$ and $I^B$ exhibit codominance, meaning both are fully expressed in the phenotype when present together. Both $I^A$ and $I^B$ are completely dominant over the recessive allele $i$. This leads to the following genotype-phenotype relationships:\n- Blood Type A: Genotypes $I^A I^A$ or $I^A i$\n- Blood Type B: Genotypes $I^B I^B$ or $I^B i$\n- Blood Type AB: Genotype $I^A I^B$\n- Blood Type O: Genotype $ii$\n\nA man with blood type AB and a woman with blood type O are planning to have children. They are discussing the genetic possibilities for their future offspring based on standard Mendelian inheritance.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the genetic possibilities for their children?\n\nA. It is possible for them to have a child with blood type AB, as the child can inherit this trait from the father.\n\nB. It is possible for them to have a child with blood type O, as the child can inherit this trait from the mother.\n\nC. All of their children will have either blood type A or blood type B.\n\nD. There is a 25% probability for each of the four blood types (A, B, AB, O).", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the correct statement regarding the possible blood types of offspring from a man with blood type AB and a woman with blood type O. We must first determine the genotypes of the parents and then predict the genotypes and corresponding phenotypes of their potential children.\n\nStep 1: Determine the parental genotypes.\nThe man has blood type AB. The phenotype AB corresponds to only one possible genotype: $I^A I^B$.\nThe woman has blood type O. The phenotype O corresponds to only one possible genotype: $ii$.\nSo, the parental cross is $I^A I^B \\times ii$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the gametes produced by each parent.\nAccording to the law of segregation, alleles for a trait separate during gamete formation.\nThe man (genotype $I^A I^B$) can produce two types of gametes: 50% of his gametes will carry the $I^A$ allele, and 50% will carry the $I^B$ allele.\nThe woman (genotype $ii$) can produce only one type of gamete: 100% of her gametes will carry the $i$ allele.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring.\nWe can use a Punnett square to visualize the possible combinations of alleles in the offspring.\n\n| | Father's $I^A$ gamete | Father's $I^B$ gamete |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Mother's $i$ gamete | $I^A i$ | $I^B i$ |\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see there are two possible genotypes for the children:\n1.  $I^A i$: This genotype results from the fusion of an $I^A$ gamete from the father and an $i$ gamete from the mother. Since $I^A$ is dominant over $i$, the child's phenotype will be blood type A.\n2.  $I^B i$: This genotype results from the fusion of an $I^B$ gamete from the father and an $i$ gamete from the mother. Since $I^B$ is dominant over $i$, the child's phenotype will be blood type B.\n\nThe probability of having a child with genotype $I^A i$ (blood type A) is 50%.\nThe probability of having a child with genotype $I^B i$ (blood type B) is 50%.\nThere are no other possible genotypes for the offspring.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options.\nA. \"It is possible for them to have a child with blood type AB, as the child can inherit this trait from the father.\" This is false. A child with blood type AB must have the genotype $I^A I^B$. To get this genotype, the child must inherit an $I^A$ allele from one parent and an $I^B$ allele from the other. The mother (genotype $ii$) cannot provide either of these alleles.\n\nB. \"It is possible for them to have a child with blood type O, as the child can inherit this trait from the mother.\" This is false. A child with blood type O must have the genotype $ii$. To get this genotype, the child must inherit an $i$ allele from both parents. The father (genotype $I^A I^B$) does not carry the $i$ allele and cannot pass it on.\n\nC. \"All of their children will have either blood type A or blood type B.\" This is true. As determined in Step 3, the only possible offspring genotypes are $I^A i$ and $I^B i$, which correspond to blood types A and B, respectively. There is a 100% chance that any child they have will be one of these two types.\n\nD. \"There is a 25% probability for each of the four blood types (A, B, AB, O).\" This is false. The probabilities are 50% for type A, 50% for type B, 0% for type AB, and 0% for type O.\n\nTherefore, the only accurate statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1505143"}, {"introduction": "Genetic analysis often involves working backward, much like a detective solving a puzzle.
