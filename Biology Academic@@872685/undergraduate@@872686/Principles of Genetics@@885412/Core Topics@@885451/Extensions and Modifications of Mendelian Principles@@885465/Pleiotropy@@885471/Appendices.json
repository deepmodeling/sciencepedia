This problem explores a mutation in an RNA-binding protein that disrupts two distinct functions: mRNA splicing and stress response, based on the modern concept of liquid-liquid phase separation. The exercise [@problem_id:1509807] introduces a quantitative approach to evaluating these multiple effects, challenging you to calculate a hypothetical \"Pleiotropic Deficit Index\" to measure the mutation's overall impact.", "problem": "A hypothetical RNA-binding protein in neurons, named *Plurifectin* (*PFN*), contains a low-complexity domain that is essential for its function. *PFN* exhibits pleiotropy by regulating two distinct cellular processes through its ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), forming condensed biomolecular structures. First, it controls the alternative splicing of a transcript for a synaptic protein, *Synaptoform* (*SYN*). The correct inclusion of exon 7, promoted by *PFN* condensates, results in a full-length, functional *SYN-L* protein, while its exclusion results in a truncated, non-functional *SYN-S* protein. Second, *PFN* is a critical component of stress granules, which are protective RNP granules that form in response to cellular stress, such as heat shock, and enhance cell survival.\n\nA point mutation in the low-complexity domain of *PFN* (denoted *PFN-mut*) completely abolishes its ability to undergo LLPS without affecting the protein's overall abundance or stability. In cultured neurons expressing the wild-type *PFN* protein (*PFN-wt*), 92% of the total *SYN* transcripts are the functional *SYN-L* isoform. In contrast, in neurons homozygous for the *PFN-mut* allele, only 18% of the *SYN* transcripts are the *SYN-L* isoform.\n\nFurthermore, the role of *PFN* in the stress response was quantified. When subjected to a standardized heat shock protocol, 75% of *PFN-wt* neurons survive. Under the identical stress conditions, only 15% of *PFN-mut* neurons survive.\n\nTo quantify the overall impact of this pleiotropic mutation, a \"Pleiotropic Deficit Index\" (PDI) is defined. The PDI is calculated as the geometric mean of the fractional loss of function for each of the two affected traits (splicing regulation and stress survival). For a given trait, the fractional loss of function is defined as the difference between the wild-type performance metric and the mutant performance metric, all divided by the wild-type performance metric.\n\nCalculate the Pleiotropic Deficit Index (PDI) for the *PFN-mut* allele.

A key scaffolding protein, encoded by the `SCAF` gene, is crucial for organizing two distinct cellular processes. A temperature-sensitive point mutation in this gene gives rise to the `scaf_ts` allele. At the permissive temperature of 22°C, the `scaf_ts` allele functions identically to the wild-type `SCAF+` allele. However, at the restrictive temperature of 35°C, the `scaf_ts/scaf_ts` homozygous genotype exhibits a pleiotropic effect.\n\nFirst, due to a loss of proper interaction with cytoskeletal components, it causes a \"Filamentation Defect\" (FD) phenotype. This FD phenotype has a penetrance of 80%.\n\nSecond, the mutation paradoxically stabilizes the scaffolding protein's interaction with a specific kinase complex, leading to a \"Spore Discoloration\" (SD) phenotype. The penetrance of this SD phenotype is dependent on a second, unlinked gene called `KREG`. In the presence of at least one wild-type `KREG+` allele, the SD phenotype has a penetrance of 60%. However, in a `kreg-/kreg-` homozygous recessive background, the kinase complex is less active, and the penetrance of the SD phenotype is reduced to 30%. The Filamentation Defect (FD) phenotype is not affected by the `KREG` gene.\n\nAssume that for any given individual, the occurrence of the FD phenotype and the SD phenotype are independent events.\n\nA true-breeding strain with the genotype `scaf_ts/scaf_ts ; KREG+/KREG+` is crossed with a true-breeding wild-type strain `SCAF+/SCAF+ ; kreg-/kreg-`. The resulting F1 progeny are intercrossed to produce an F2 generation. If the entire F2 generation is raised at the restrictive temperature of 35°C, what proportion of the progeny are expected to display at least one of the mutant phenotypes (either FD or SD)?\n\nProvide your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the proportion of F2 progeny showing at least one mutant phenotype (Filamentation Defect or Spore Discoloration) when raised at the restrictive temperature.\n\nFirst, let's establish the genotypes of the parental (P) and F1 generations.\nP: (`scaf_ts/scaf_ts ; KREG+/KREG+`) $\\times$ (`SCAF+/SCAF+ ; kreg-/kreg-`)\nF1: All progeny will have the genotype `SCAF+/scaf_ts ; KREG+/kreg-`.\nSince `SCAF+` is dominant over `scaf_ts` (as `scaf_ts` only shows a phenotype in the homozygous state), the F1 generation will be phenotypically wild-type.\n\nNext, we analyze the F2 generation produced by an F1 intercross: `SCAF+/scaf_ts ; KREG+/kreg-` $\\times$ `SCAF+/scaf_ts ; KREG+/kreg-`.\nThe mutant phenotypes are only expressed in the `scaf_ts/scaf_ts` background.
