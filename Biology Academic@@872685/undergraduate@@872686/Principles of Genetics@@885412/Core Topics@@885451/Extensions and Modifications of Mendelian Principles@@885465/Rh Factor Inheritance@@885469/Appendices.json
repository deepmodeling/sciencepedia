A Rh-negative person must have genotype $rr$, so the father is $rr$. The man must have inherited an $r$ allele from his father. Since the man is Rh-positive, his genotype cannot be $rr$, so it must be $Rr$. Therefore, the man’s genotype is $Rr$.\n\nThe woman is Rh-negative, so her genotype is $rr$.\n\nWe consider the cross $Rr \\times rr$.

This final practice, [@problem_id:1518234], delves into the molecular complexity behind the Rh system by presenting a real-world clinical puzzle: a case of Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN) in the child of an Rh-positive mother. Solving this requires you to look beyond standard phenotypes and consider how rare alleles, such as those causing a 'partial D' antigen, can lead to unexpected and serious immunological reactions.", "problem": "In human genetics, the Rh blood group system is of major clinical importance, particularly concerning Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). The primary determinant of Rh status is the *RHD* gene. Individuals with at least one dominant $D$ allele are Rh-positive, expressing the RhD antigen on their red blood cells. Individuals with a homozygous recessive $dd$ genotype lack the *RHD* gene entirely and are Rh-negative.\n\nA common simplification states that only Rh-negative mothers are at risk of developing anti-D antibodies and causing Rh-based HDN in an Rh-positive fetus. However, consider a rare clinical case: A woman who has always tested as Rh-positive gives birth to her second child. Both the mother and the newborn test as Rh-positive. The father is also Rh-positive. Despite this, the newborn develops symptoms of HDN, and laboratory tests confirm the cause is maternal anti-D antibodies attacking the newborn's red blood cells.\n\nGenetic analysis reveals that rare alleles of the *RHD* gene exist. These alleles, known as \"partial D\" alleles, contain mutations that result in the expression of an altered RhD protein. This altered protein is still detected as \"positive\" in standard blood typing but is structurally different from the \"standard\" RhD antigen produced by the most common D allele.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios provides the most plausible genetic explanation for this case of HDN in the child of an Rh-positive mother?\n\nA. The mother possesses a \"partial D\" allele, while the fetus inherited a \"standard D\" allele from the father. The mother's immune system recognized the component of the standard D antigen that she lacks as foreign.\nB. The mother is heterozygous (Dd). During pregnancy, her immune system spontaneously lost tolerance to the D antigen and began producing antibodies against her own red blood cells as well as the fetus's.\nC. Both parents are heterozygous (Dd) for the RHD gene. The child is homozygous dominant (DD), and the \"double dose\" of the D antigen triggered an immune response from the heterozygous mother.\nD. A laboratory error occurred, and the mother is actually Rh-negative (dd). Her positive test result was a false positive.\nE. The HDN was caused by an incompatibility in a different blood group system, like Kell or Duffy, and the presence of anti-D antibodies is a coincidental finding unrelated to the disease.", "solution": "1) Define the immunohematologic baseline. The *RHD* gene encodes the D antigen on red blood cells. Individuals with at least one functional D allele ($D$) are typically typed as Rh-positive; individuals with $dd$ are Rh-negative. Immune tolerance prevents an individual from mounting an antibody response against self antigens present on their own red cells.\n\n2) Introduce the variant-allele principle relevant to the case. Certain rare *RHD* alleles encode a structurally altered D protein (so-called partial D). These partial D antigens lack one or more epitopes present on the common or “standard” D antigen, yet agglutination with standard reagents in routine testing usually leads to an Rh-positive result. Therefore, such individuals are phenotypically Rh-positive by routine typing but are not immunologically tolerant to the epitopes they do not express.\n\n3) Apply the alloimmunization mechanism. When a partial D mother is exposed to red cells expressing the full complement of D epitopes (e.g., from a fetus who inherited a standard $D$ allele from the father), the maternal immune system can recognize the missing D epitopes as non-self and mount an alloimmune response, producing anti-D antibodies directed specifically against those absent epitopes. Sensitization can occur during a prior pregnancy or fetomaternal hemorrhage, explaining why the second child is affected.\n\n4) Connect to Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). Maternal IgG anti-D alloantibodies cross the placenta and bind fetal red cells expressing the full D epitopes, causing hemolysis and HDN. This mechanism is fully consistent with: (i) the mother typing Rh-positive by standard methods, (ii) the fetus also typing Rh-positive, and (iii) laboratory confirmation that maternal anti-D antibodies are the cause of hemolysis.\n\n5) Exclude alternatives by immunologic principles of tolerance and antigen dose:\n- Against B: A heterozygous $Dd$ mother expresses the standard D antigen and is immunologically tolerant to D epitopes; spontaneous loss of tolerance would produce autoantibodies against her own D, leading to maternal hemolysis, and would not typically be classified as allo-anti-D causing HDN in this specific pattern. The case specifies allo-anti-D as the cause.\n- Against C: Antigen dose (“double dose” in $DD$) does not break tolerance to self; a $Dd$ mother’s D epitopes are the same as those on $DD$ fetal cells, so no alloimmune response is expected purely from dosage.\n- Against D: A laboratory false positive converting an Rh-negative ($dd$) mother to Rh-positive in repeated testing is unlikely and does not account for the explicit finding of anti-D in a mother typed as Rh-positive; moreover, the clinical vignette emphasizes the recognized partial D mechanism.\n- Against E: The case states laboratory confirmation that anti-D is causative. Therefore, attributing HDN to another blood group while calling anti-D coincidental contradicts the given data.\n\n6) Conclusion. The mechanism that aligns with established immunohematology, the Rh typing results, and the confirmed causative antibody is that the mother carries a partial D allele, and exposure to a fetus with a standard D antigen elicited allo-anti-D to the missing epitopes, resulting in HDN. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1518234"}]}
