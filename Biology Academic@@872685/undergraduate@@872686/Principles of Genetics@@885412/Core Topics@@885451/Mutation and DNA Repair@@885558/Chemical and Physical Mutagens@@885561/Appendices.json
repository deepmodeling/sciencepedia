This exercise traces the precise biochemical steps that translate a chemical attack on a single DNA base into a permanent, heritable mutation. By following the fate of a guanine base treated with the alkylating agent Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), you will see how its altered pairing properties during DNA replication lead to a classic G:C to A:T transition, a foundational mechanism in chemical mutagenesis and genetic research [@problem_id:1474238].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a critical enzyme and wants to investigate the function of a specific amino acid, aspartic acid, at a particular position. The codon for this aspartic acid on the coding strand of the gene is $5'$-GAC-$3'$. The researcher decides to induce mutations using the chemical agent Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). EMS is an alkylating agent known to primarily add an ethyl group to the $O^6$ position of guanine residues. This chemical modification alters the hydrogen-bonding properties of guanine, causing it to preferentially base-pair with thymine instead of its normal partner, cytosine, during DNA replication.\n\nAssume a single, successful alkylation event occurs on the guanine base of the specified $5'$-GAC-$3'$ codon on the coding strand. Following this event, the cell undergoes two complete and error-free rounds of DNA replication. What will be the final sequence of this specific codon on the coding strand in the resulting mutated DNA molecule? Express your answer as a three-letter sequence in the $5'$ to $3'$ direction.", "solution": "We begin with the original double-stranded DNA at the codon, where the coding (sense) strand is $5'$-GAC-$3'$ and the template (antisense) strand is $3'$-CTG-$5'$, consistent with Watson-Crick base pairing (G with C, A with T, C with G).\n\nEthyl methanesulfonate (EMS) alkylates the $O^6$ position of guanine on the coding strand, converting that guanine to an $O^6$-ethylguanine (denote it as G*). This modification alters pairing specificity so that, during replication, G* preferentially pairs with T instead of C.\n\nRound 1 of replication:\n- When the damaged coding strand $5'$-G*AC-$3'$ is used as template, the polymerase incorporates T opposite G*, and normal pairing for the remaining bases yields a newly synthesized complementary strand $3'$-TTG-$5'$.\n- When the undamaged template strand $3'$-CTG-$5'$ is used as template, normal pairing yields a newly synthesized coding strand $5'$-GAC-$3'$.\n\nThus, after the first round, one daughter duplex contains a T opposite the lesion (mismatch relative to the original), and the other daughter duplex remains unchanged at this site.\n\nRound 2 of replication:\n- Replicating the strand that contains T at this position ($3'$-TTG-$5'$ as template) produces a new strand with A opposite T, yielding a daughter strand $5'$-AAC-$3'$.\n- Replicating the damaged strand again continues to place T opposite G*, but in the complementary branch where the T-containing strand serves as template, the A:T pair becomes fixed. This is the canonical fixation of a GC to AT transition caused by EMS.\n\nThe final, stably inherited mutation after two error-free rounds is therefore a G:C to A:T transition at the first position of the codon on the coding strand, changing $5'$-GAC-$3'$ to $5'$-AAC-$3'$.\n\nHence, the final sequence of the codon on the coding strand in the mutated DNA molecule is AAC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AAC}$$", "id": "1474238"}, {"introduction": "How do scientists quantify the potency of a potential mutagen in the laboratory? This problem moves from a single molecular event to a population-level experiment, using a classic yeast reversion assay. It challenges you to predict the shape of a dose-response curve, revealing a crucial real-world complication: the dual effects of mutagenesis and cytotoxicity. This practice will help you understand how to interpret experimental results where a substance can both cause mutations and kill the cells it acts upon, a fundamental concept in toxicology and genetic screening [@problem_id:1474257].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the mutagenic properties of a newly synthesized alkylating agent, designated \"Chemical X\". The experiment uses a strain of yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, that is auxotrophic for the amino acid histidine (genotype `his-`). This strain cannot grow on a minimal medium that lacks histidine. The goal is to measure the ability of Chemical X to induce reverse mutations, converting the yeast back to a prototrophic state (genotype `his+`), which can synthesize its own histidine and thus grow on the minimal medium.\n\nThe experimental procedure involves the following steps:\n1. Several identical cultures of the `his-` yeast strain are prepared.\n2. Each culture is exposed to a different concentration of Chemical X, ranging from very low to very high levels. A control culture is treated with a solvent lacking Chemical X.\n3. After treatment, a standard number of cells from each culture is plated onto a minimal medium agar plate that completely lacks histidine.\n4. The plates are incubated, and after several days, the number of visible colonies on each plate is counted. Each colony represents a single `his+` revertant cell that successfully divided.\n\nAssuming Chemical X is a potent mutagen but is also cytotoxic at high concentrations, which of the following descriptions best represents the expected relationship between the concentration of Chemical X (plotted on the x-axis) and the number of revertant colonies observed (plotted on the y-axis)?\n\nA. A linear relationship where the number of colonies increases proportionally with the concentration of Chemical X.\n\nB. An exponential increase in the number of colonies as the concentration of Chemical X increases.\n\nC. The number of colonies increases with concentration up to a certain point, after which the number of colonies begins to decrease as the concentration continues to rise.\n\nD. The number of colonies remains near zero at low concentrations and then rises sharply in a sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve, eventually reaching a stable, high plateau at high concentrations.\n\nE. The number of colonies decreases as the concentration of Chemical X increases, showing an entirely inhibitory effect.", "solution": "Let $c$ denote the concentration of Chemical X. Let $N_{0}$ be the standard number of cells plated from each culture (a constant). Define $S(c)$ as the fraction of cells that survive the treatment and can form colonies (cell survival), and define $\\mu(c)$ as the probability that a surviving cell is a $his^{+}$ revertant (mutation induction to prototrophy).\n\nThe expected number of revertant colonies observed on minimal medium is then\n$$\nR(c) = N_{0}\\,S(c)\\,\\mu(c).\n$$\nBy the problem statement, Chemical X is a potent mutagen and cytotoxic at high concentrations. These properties imply the following qualitative behaviors:\n- Mutagenicity increases with concentration, so $\\mu(c)$ is an increasing function of $c$ (at least over an initial range), i.e., $\\mu'(c) > 0$ for low to moderate $c$.\n- Cytotoxicity increases with concentration, so survival decreases with concentration, i.e., $S'(c) < 0$, with $S(c)$ becoming small at high $c$.\n\nDifferentiate $R(c)$ with respect to $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dc} = N_{0}\\left[S'(c)\\,\\mu(c) + S(c)\\,\\mu'(c)\\right].\n$$\n- At low $c$, cytotoxicity is minimal, so $|S'(c)|$ is small and $S(c) \\approx 1$, while mutagenicity increases with $c$, so $\\mu'(c) > 0$. Thus $\\frac{dR}{dc} > 0$ initially, and $R(c)$ increases.\n- At high $c$, cytotoxicity dominates, so $S(c)$ becomes small and $S'(c)$ is strongly negative; even if $\\mu'(c) \\ge 0$, the term $S'(c)\\,\\mu(c)$ dominates negatively, giving $\\frac{dR}{dc} < 0$. Thus $R(c)$ decreases at high $c$.\n\nBy continuity, there exists a concentration $c^{\\ast}$ where $\\frac{dR}{dc} = 0$ and $R(c)$ attains a maximum. Therefore, $R(c)$ increases with $c$ at low to moderate concentrations and then decreases at high concentrations due to cytotoxicity. This corresponds to a peaked (inverted U-shaped) dose-response curve.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (linear increase) and B (exponential increase) ignore high-dose cytotoxicity.\n- D (sigmoidal rise to a high plateau) implies sustained survival at high $c$, which contradicts cytotoxicity.\n- E (monotonic decrease) contradicts the mutagenic property.\n- C matches the derived behavior: increase up to a maximum, then decrease as cytotoxicity prevails.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1474257"}, {"introduction": "The impact of a mutagen is not solely determined by its chemical reactivity; it is profoundly influenced by the cell's own defense systems.

The focus is on the lesion 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), which, if unrepaired before DNA replication, can pair with adenine, leading to a G:C to T:A transversion mutation after a subsequent round of replication. The primary defense against this lesion is the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway, initiated by the DNA glycosylase OGG1.\n\nTwo yeast strains are used in a reversion assay. The first is a wild-type (WT) strain with a functional BER pathway. The second is an `ogg1Δ` mutant strain, which completely lacks the OGG1 enzyme and thus has a non-functional repair pathway for 8-oxoG. Both strains carry a `his3` mutation that can be reverted to the `HIS+` phenotype by a specific G:C to T:A transversion. The mutation frequency is measured as the number of `HIS+` revertant colonies per viable cell plated.\n\nThe experiment yields the following data:\n1.
