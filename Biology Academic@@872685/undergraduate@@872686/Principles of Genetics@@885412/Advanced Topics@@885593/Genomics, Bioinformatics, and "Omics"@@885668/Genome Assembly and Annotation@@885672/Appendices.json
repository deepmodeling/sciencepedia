The FASTA format is a text-based format for representing nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which base pairs or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. A sequence in FASTA format consists of two main parts:\n\n1.  A **header line**: This is a single line that must start with a greater-than symbol (`>`). The rest of this line contains a unique identifier for the sequence and often includes other descriptive information. There are no strict rules for the content after the `>` symbol.\n2.  The **sequence data**: The lines following the header line contain the sequence itself. The sequence can be on a single line or split across multiple lines. Lines containing sequence data must not begin with a `>`.\n\nNow, we will analyze each option based on this definition.\n\n**Option A:** This excerpt begins with a line starting with a `>` symbol (`>Contig_1_B.anthracis...`). This serves as the header line. The subsequent lines contain a sequence of characters (A, C, G, T), which represent the nucleotide sequence. This structure perfectly matches the definition of the FASTA format.\n\n**Option B:** This excerpt consists only of sequence data. It is missing the mandatory header line that must begin with a `>`. This is often referred to as a \"raw\" or \"plain\" sequence format and is not FASTA format.\n\n**Option C:** This excerpt begins with a line starting with an at-symbol (`@`), not a `>`. It is followed by a sequence line, a line containing only a plus symbol (`+`), and then a line of ASCII characters that represent quality scores. This four-line structure is characteristic of the FASTQ format, which is commonly used for raw sequencing reads and includes per-base quality information. It is not FASTA format.\n\n**Option D:** This excerpt shows a highly structured format with keywords like `LOCUS`, `DEFINITION`, `ACCESSION`, and `ORIGIN`. The sequence data itself is annotated with line numbers. This is the characteristic format of a GenBank file, which contains rich annotations in addition to the sequence. It is not FASTA format.\n\n**Option E:** This excerpt shows a single line where information is separated by commas. This is a form of a delimited format, such as a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file. It does not follow the `>` header and subsequent sequence line structure required by the FASTA format.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, only Option A adheres to the rules of the FASTA format.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1493807"}, {"introduction": "After assembling millions of short sequencing reads into longer contiguous sequences called \"contigs,\" a crucial question remains: how good is the assembly? The N50 statistic is a widely used metric to measure the contiguity of an assembly, providing a single, powerful number that reflects how connected the final sequence is.

After sequencing, they use two different assembly algorithms, which result in two different sets of contiguous DNA sequences (contigs). To evaluate and compare the quality of the two assemblies, the team needs to calculate several metrics, one of the most important being the N50 statistic.\n\nThe N50 statistic is a measure of assembly contiguity. It is defined as the length of the shortest contig in the smallest set of contigs whose lengths sum to at least 50% of the total assembly length.\n\nYou are given the complete list of contig lengths for one of the outputs, \"Assembly Alpha\". The lengths of the contigs, in kilobases (kb), are:\n`110, 15, 95, 6, 25, 45, 70, 4`\n\nCalculate the N50 statistic for Assembly Alpha.

The provided contig lengths in kilobases (kb) are: `110, 15, 95, 6, 25, 45, 70, 4`.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total length of the assembly.\nWe sum the lengths of all the contigs:\n$$ \\text{Total Length} = 110 + 15 + 95 + 6 + 25 + 45 + 70 + 4 $$\n$$ \\text{Total Length} = 370 \\text{ kb} $$\n\nStep 2: Determine the 50% threshold of the total assembly length.\nThis is the target value that our cumulative sum of contig lengths must reach or exceed.\n$$ 50\\% \\text{ of Total Length} = 0.5 \\times 370 \\text{ kb} = 185 \\text{ kb} $$\n\nStep 3: Sort the contig lengths in descending order.\nArranging the contigs from longest to shortest is essential for the N50 calculation.\nSorted list: `110, 95, 70, 45, 25, 15, 6, 4`\n\nStep 4: Calculate the cumulative sum of the sorted contig lengths.\nWe add the contig lengths one by one, starting from the largest, until the cumulative sum is greater than or equal to the 50% threshold calculated in Step 2.\n\n- Add the first (longest) contig:\n  Cumulative Sum = `110` kb. This is less than `185` kb.\n\n- Add the second longest contig:\n  Cumulative Sum = `110 + 95 = 205` kb.\n\nThis cumulative sum (`205` kb) is the first sum that is greater than or equal to the 50% threshold (`185` kb).\n\nStep 5: Identify the N50 value.\nThe N50 statistic is defined as the length of the shortest contig in the set that was summed to reach this threshold. In our case, the set of contigs is `{110, 95}`. The shortest contig in this set is `95` kb.
