For an X-linked recessive disorder:\n- An affected male has genotype $X^{m}Y$ and must have inherited the mutant $X^{m}$ from his mother.\n- A son inherits $Y$ from his father and his single $X$ chromosome from his mother; thus, a son’s risk depends only on the mother’s carrier status and her transmission.\n\nGiven that the woman’s brother is affected and both parents are phenotypically normal, the mother is a carrier under standard Mendelian assumptions. Let the mother be $X^{m}X^{N}$ and the father $X^{N}Y$. For the phenotypically normal daughter in question:\n- She receives $X^{N}$ from her father with probability $1$.\n- From her carrier mother, she receives $X^{m}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $X^{N}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the probability that the woman is a carrier is\n$$\nP(\\text{woman is carrier})=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nShe is expecting a son with a phenotypically normal man.

For an individual to have normal hearing, they must possess at least one dominant allele for both genes (genotype $A\\_ B\\_$).
