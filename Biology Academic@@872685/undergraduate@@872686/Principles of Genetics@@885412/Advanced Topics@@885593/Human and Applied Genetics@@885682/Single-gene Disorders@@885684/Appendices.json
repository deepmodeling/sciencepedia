This first practice problem takes us into a common scenario faced in genetic counseling, where the birth of an affected child reveals the carrier status of the parents.

This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele to be affected by the disease. Consider a couple where both the male and female partners are phenotypically normal. They have a child who is diagnosed with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. They later have a daughter who is phenotypically normal. What is the probability that this phenotypically normal daughter is a heterozygous carrier of the allele for the syndrome?\n\nExpress your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is autosomal recessive, so an affected child must have genotype $aa$. For a child to be $aa$, each parent must contribute an $a$ allele, which implies both parents are obligate carriers with genotype $Aa$. This conclusion follows from Mendelian inheritance for autosomal loci.\n\nGiven both parents are $Aa$, by Mendelian segregation each child’s genotype distribution is:\n$$\nP(AA)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Aa)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(aa)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nLet $C$ be the event “child is a carrier,” i.e., genotype $Aa$, and let $N$ be the event “child is phenotypically normal,” i.e., genotype not $aa$. We seek $P(C\\mid N)$.\n\nUsing conditional probability,\n$$\nP(C\\mid N)=\\frac{P(C\\cap N)}{P(N)}.\n$$\nSince carriers ($Aa$) are phenotypically normal in an autosomal recessive condition, $C\\subset N$, so $P(C\\cap N)=P(C)$.

This problem shifts our perspective from a single family to an entire population.

The disease-causing allele is denoted by $D$, and the corresponding healthy allele is $d$. A molecular marker, located on the same chromosome as the CH7 gene, is used for tracking inheritance. This marker has two codominant alleles: one detectable by a probe, which we denote as $M$, and one that is not, denoted as $m$. Consequently, an individual with genotype $MM$ or $Mm$ will test positive for the marker, while an individual with genotype $mm$ will test negative.\n\nA couple seeks genetic counseling. The male partner is affected with CH7 and is heterozygous for the disease gene ($Dd$). Genetic analysis also reveals he is heterozygous for the marker ($Mm$). Through family history analysis, it is determined that his chromosome arrangement is in the coupling (or cis) configuration, meaning his genotype is $D M / d m$. The female partner is phenotypically healthy, is unaffected by CH7, and tests negative for the marker, indicating her genotype is $d m / d m$.\n\nThrough extensive population data, the recombination frequency between the CH7 gene locus and the molecular marker locus has been accurately determined to be 8.0%.\n\nWhat is the probability that this couple will have a child who eventually develops CH7 but tests negative for the molecular marker?
