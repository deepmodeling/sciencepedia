The protocol involves amplifying several Short Tandem Repeat (STR) loci from the DNA sample using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The resulting mixture contains DNA fragments of various sizes corresponding to the different STR alleles. To separate these fragments, the student uses agarose gel electrophoresis. The standard procedure is to place the agarose gel in a chamber filled with an ionic buffer solution, load the DNA sample into wells at one end of the gel, and apply an electric field across the gel.\n\nHowever, the student makes a critical error. They place the gel into the electrophoresis chamber such that the wells containing the DNA sample are positioned at the end of the gel nearest to the positive electrode (anode), while the opposite end of the gel is near the negative electrode (cathode). The student then turns on the power supply and runs the gel for the standard duration, after which they stain the gel with a DNA-binding dye to visualize the results.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes will the student most likely observe?\n\nA. The DNA fragments will remain in the wells and will not have migrated.\n\nB. The gel will appear empty, with no DNA bands visible anywhere between the wells and the far end of the gel.\n\nC. The DNA fragments will have separated by size, but the migration pattern will be reversed: the largest fragments will be farthest from the wells and the smallest fragments will be closest.\n\nD.

Let the net charge on a DNA fragment be denoted by $q$, with $q<0$. When an electric field $\\vec{E}$ is applied, the electric force on the DNA is given by the fundamental relation of electrostatics:\n$$\n\\vec{F} = q \\vec{E}.\n$$\nBy convention, $\\vec{E}$ points from the positive electrode (anode) to the negative electrode (cathode). Because $q<0$, the force $\\vec{F}$ on DNA points opposite to $\\vec{E}$, that is, toward the anode. The drift velocity in an electrophoretic medium is proportional to the mobility $\\mu$ and the field:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{d} = \\mu \\vec{E}, \\quad \\mu = \\frac{q}{f},\n$$\nwhere $f>0$ is the frictional coefficient set by the sieving matrix (agarose). Since $q<0$, $\\mu<0$, and therefore $\\vec{v}_{d}$ points toward the anode.\n\nIn the standard, correct setup for agarose gel electrophoresis, the sample wells are placed near the cathode so that DNA, driven toward the anode, migrates into and through the gel, separating by size due to size-dependent friction in the agarose matrix. In the erroneous setup described, the wells are near the anode and the far end of the gel is near the cathode. The electric field direction remains from anode to cathode, so DNA still migrates toward the anode. Consequently, immediately upon application of the field, the DNA will move out of the wells in the direction of the anode-side buffer reservoir rather than into the body of the gel. Because the wells are at the anode end, the DNA will quickly exit the gel and enter the buffer at the anode, preventing size-dependent separation within the gel.\n\nAfter running for the standard duration and staining the gel, there will be no DNA bands visible within the gel between the wells and the far end. Any DNA would have migrated out of the gel into the buffer near the anode, leaving the gel appearing empty. Therefore, the most likely observed outcome is that no bands are visible in the gel.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1488276"}, {"introduction": "Crime scene evidence often contains DNA from more than one person, creating what is known as a mixed sample. A forensic analyst's first task when faced with a complex DNA profile is often to determine the minimum number of individuals who could have contributed to it. This initial assessment guides the entire subsequent analysis. This problem [@problem_id:1488240] provides a scenario with a mixed DNA profile and asks you to apply a core principle of human genetics—our diploid nature—to deduce the minimum number of contributors.", "problem": "In a forensic investigation, a mixed DNA sample was recovered from a piece of evidence. The sample was analyzed using a standard panel of genetic markers known as Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). An STR locus is a specific location on a chromosome where a short DNA sequence is repeated a variable number of times. The different versions of an STR locus, characterized by the number of repeats, are called alleles. Humans are diploid organisms, meaning they inherit one allele for each STR locus from each biological parent. Consequently, a single individual can have at most two different alleles (i.e., be heterozygous) for any given STR locus, or one unique allele if they are homozygous.\n\nThe analysis of the mixed sample yielded the following allelic profile at two different, unlinked STR loci, TH01 and D5S818:\n\n- At locus TH01, the alleles detected were 7, 8, and 9.3.\n- At locus D5S818, the alleles detected were 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nBased on this evidence, what is the minimum number of individuals who must have contributed to this mixed DNA sample? The final answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of individuals required to explain a mixed DNA profile at two separate loci. The key principle to solve this problem is that humans are diploid, meaning each individual can have at most two different alleles at any single genetic locus.\n\nLet's analyze each locus separately to determine the minimum number of contributors required to explain the observed alleles.\n\nFirst, consider the STR locus TH01. The analysis detected three distinct alleles: 7, 8, and 9.3.\nLet $N$ be the number of individuals contributing to the sample. Since each individual can contribute at most two alleles to the mix, the maximum number of distinct alleles that $N$ individuals can account for at a single locus is $2 \\times N$.\nIn this case, we have 3 observed alleles at locus TH01. Therefore, we must satisfy the inequality:\n$$2 \\times N \\ge 3$$\nDividing by 2, we get:\n$$N \\ge \\frac{3}{2}$$\n$$N \\ge 1.5$$\nSince the number of individuals, $N$, must be a whole number, the minimum integer value for $N$ that satisfies this condition is 2. Thus, at least two individuals are required to explain the presence of three alleles at locus TH01. For example, one individual could have the genotype (7, 8) and a second individual could have the genotype (9.3, 9.3).\n\nNext, consider the STR locus D5S818. The analysis detected four distinct alleles: 10, 11, 12, and 13.\nUsing the same principle, the maximum number of alleles from $N$ contributors is $2 \\times N$. We have 4 observed alleles, so we must satisfy:\n$$2 \\times N \\ge 4$$\nDividing by 2, we get:\n$$N \\ge 2$$\nThe minimum integer value for $N$ that satisfies this condition is 2. Therefore, at least two individuals are also required to explain the presence of four alleles at locus D5S818. For instance, one person could have genotype (10, 11) and a second person could have genotype (12, 13).\n\nTo find the minimum number of contributors for the entire profile, we must find the smallest number of individuals that can simultaneously account for the alleles at *both* loci. The minimum number of contributors for the whole sample must be greater than or equal to the minimum number required for any single locus.\nFrom our analysis:\n- Minimum for TH01 is 2.\n- Minimum for D5S818 is 2.\n\nThe overall minimum number of contributors is the maximum of these individual minimums:\n$$\\text{Minimum total contributors} = \\max(2, 2) = 2$$\n\nWe should verify that two individuals are indeed sufficient to explain the entire profile. Let's construct a possible scenario with two contributors:\n- **Contributor 1:** Genotype TH01(7, 8) and Genotype D5S818(10, 11).\n- **Contributor 2:** Genotype TH01(9.3, a) and Genotype D5S818(12, 13).\nFor Contributor 2 at locus TH01, we need to account for allele 9.3. The second allele, 'a', can be any allele already present in the mix (7, 8, or 9.3) to avoid introducing a new, unobserved allele. For example, if we let $a = 7$, then Contributor 2's genotype at TH01 is (7, 9.3).\n\nSo, a valid two-person profile could be:\n- Contributor 1: TH01(7, 8); D5S818(10, 11)\n- Contributor 2: TH01(7, 9.3); D5S818(12, 13)\n\nThis combination of two individuals successfully accounts for all observed alleles: {7, 8, 9.3} at locus TH01 and {10, 11, 12, 13} at locus D5S818.\nSince we have mathematically determined that at least 2 people are necessary and have shown that 2 people are sufficient, the minimum number of contributors is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1488240"}, {"introduction": "Identifying a suspect's DNA profile at a crime scene is only part of the story; the crucial next step is to convey the statistical significance of that match.
