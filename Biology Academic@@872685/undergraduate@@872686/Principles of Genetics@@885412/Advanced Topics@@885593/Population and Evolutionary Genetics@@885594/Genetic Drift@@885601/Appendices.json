For a selectively neutral allele, its long-term fate is a matter of chance, but the probability of either outcome is surprisingly straightforward to determine.

Genetic analysis of this founding population focuses on a single gene locus with two alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$. This locus is known to control a minor variation in leaf serration pattern, a trait that confers no selective advantage or disadvantage in the pine's environment. The genotype count in this new population is found to be:\n- 24 individuals with genotype $A_1A_1$\n- 12 individuals with genotype $A_1A_2$\n- 4 individuals with genotype $A_2A_2$\n\nAssume the population is diploid, randomly mating, and that generations are non-overlapping. Furthermore, assume that the effects of mutation and gene flow from other populations are negligible over the long term. Under the influence of genetic drift alone, what is the ultimate probability that the $A_2$ allele will be lost from this population?\n\nA. 0.25\n\nB. 0.50\n\nC. 0.70\n\nD. 0.75\n\nE. 0.85", "solution": "The core principle governing the fate of a selectively neutral allele under genetic drift is that its long-term probability of fixation (becoming the only allele at that locus in the population) is equal to its initial frequency. Consequently, the probability of its eventual loss from the population is equal to one minus its initial frequency. The population size influences the rate at which drift occurs, but not the ultimate probabilities of fixation or loss for a neutral allele.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the allele $A_2$ will be lost. Let $p_{A_2}$ be the initial frequency of the $A_2$ allele. The probability of loss is given by $1 - p_{A_2}$. Our first step is to calculate $p_{A_2}$ from the provided genotype counts.\n\nThe total number of individuals in the population is given by the sum of the individuals with each genotype:\nTotal individuals = (Number of $A_1A_1$) + (Number of $A_1A_2$) + (Number of $A_2A_2$)\nTotal individuals = $24 + 12 + 4 = 40$.\n\nSince the Wollemi pines are diploid organisms, each individual carries two alleles at this locus. Therefore, the total number of alleles in the gene pool is:\nTotal alleles = $2 \\times (\\text{Total individuals}) = 2 \\times 40 = 80$.\n\nNext, we count the number of $A_2$ alleles in the population. Homozygous $A_2A_2$ individuals each carry two $A_2$ alleles, and heterozygous $A_1A_2$ individuals each carry one $A_2$ allele.\nNumber of $A_2$ alleles = $(2 \\times \\text{Number of } A_2A_2) + (1 \\times \\text{Number of } A_1A_2)$\nNumber of $A_2$ alleles = $(2 \\times 4) + (1 \\times 12) = 8 + 12 = 20$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the initial frequency of the $A_2$ allele, $p_{A_2}$:\n$$p_{A_2} = \\frac{\\text{Number of } A_2 \\text{ alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles in the population}} = \\frac{20}{80} = 0.25$$\n\nThe probability of fixation for the $A_2$ allele is equal to this initial frequency, so $P(\\text{fixation of } A_2) = p_{A_2} = 0.25$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of loss. Since the allele must either be fixed or lost eventually, the sum of these probabilities is 1.\n$P(\\text{loss of } A_2) + P(\\text{fixation of } A_2) = 1$\nTherefore, the probability of loss is:\n$P(\\text{loss of } A_2) = 1 - P(\\text{fixation of } A_2) = 1 - p_{A_2}$\n$P(\\text{loss of } A_2) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1492485"}, {"introduction": "Beyond determining the ultimate fate of alleles, genetic drift has a continuous, measurable effect on a population's genetic diversity each generation. In small populations, random sampling effects lead to a steady erosion of heterozygosity, a key measure of genetic variation. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to quantify this decay over time, using the classic formula to calculate how much genetic diversity is expected to remain after a few generations in a very small population.", "problem": "A conservation program for the critically endangered Española Island Giant Tortoise (*Chelonoidis hoodensis*) is established at a zoological park. The entire captive population is founded by a single breeding pair (one male, one female). These two founders are confirmed to be unrelated and are heterozygous for a specific neutral genetic locus.\n\nFor modeling purposes, assume the breeding program maintains a constant population size consisting of exactly one breeding pair in each subsequent generation. Further assume that mating is random, generations are non-overlapping, and there is no mutation, migration, or natural selection acting on this locus.\n\nAfter three generations of breeding under these conditions, what proportion of the original heterozygosity at this locus is expected to remain in the population? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the proportion of initial heterozygosity remaining after a certain number of generations in a small, idealized population. The decline in heterozygosity in such a population is due to the effects of random genetic drift.\n\nThe key principle governing this process is the formula for heterozygosity decay over time. The expected heterozygosity $H_t$ in generation $t$ is related to the initial heterozygosity $H_0$ by the equation:\n$$H_t = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)^t$$\nwhere $N$ is the diploid population size and $t$ is the number of generations.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can identify the following parameters:\nThe population is founded by and maintained at a size of a single breeding pair, which means the diploid population size is $N = 2$.\nWe are interested in the state of the population after three generations, so $t = 3$.\n\nThe question asks for the proportion of the original heterozygosity remaining, which is the ratio $\\frac{H_3}{H_0}$. We can find this ratio by rearranging the formula:\n$$\\frac{H_t}{H_0} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)^t$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values of $N=2$ and $t=3$ into this expression:\n$$\\frac{H_3}{H_0} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2(2)}\\right)^3$$\n\nWe can now perform the calculation step-by-step. First, simplify the term inside the parentheses:\n$$\\frac{H_3}{H_0} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3$$\n$$\\frac{H_3}{H_0} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3$$\n\nNext, compute the cubic power of the fraction:\n$$\\frac{H_3}{H_0} = \\frac{3^3}{4^3} = \\frac{27}{64}$$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to the required precision.\n$$\\frac{27}{64} = 0.421875$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 4, 2, and 1. The fourth significant figure is 8, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$0.421875 \\approx 0.422$$\n\nThus, the proportion of initial heterozygosity expected to remain after three generations is 0.422.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.422}$$", "id": "1492466"}, {"introduction": "In nature, evolutionary forces rarely act in isolation; the fate of an allele is often decided by the interplay between random genetic drift and deterministic natural selection. A crucial question is determining which force will have the upper hand. This problem explores this critical balance by asking you to find the effective population size ($N_e$) at which the random effects of drift are equal in strength to the directional push of selection, providing a rule of thumb for predicting whether a beneficial mutation is likely to be fixed or lost by chance.", "problem": "In a small, isolated population of an endangered island fox, a new mutation has arisen that confers a slight advantage in digesting a newly available food source. The fitness of individuals homozygous for this new allele is higher than that of the wild-type homozygotes, leading to a selection coefficient, denoted by $s$, of $s = 0.005$ favoring the new allele. In population genetics, the relative influence of random genetic drift compared to natural selection is a critical factor in determining whether such a beneficial allele will become fixed or be lost. The strength of genetic drift is inversely related to the effective population size, $N_e$. At what effective population size, $N_e$, would the influence of genetic drift be considered equal in magnitude to the force of selection acting on this allele?", "solution": "The fate of a new allele in a population is governed by the interplay between two major evolutionary forces: natural selection and genetic drift. Natural selection acts deterministically to increase the frequency of advantageous alleles, while genetic drift causes random fluctuations in allele frequencies from generation to generation due to chance events.\n\nThe strength of natural selection is quantified by the selection coefficient, $s$. A positive value of $s$ indicates that the allele is beneficial. In this problem, we are given $s = 0.005$.\n\nThe strength of genetic drift is inversely proportional to the effective population size, $N_e$. The effect of drift is often characterized by the magnitude of allele frequency fluctuations it can cause in a single generation, which is on the order of $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. This is because smaller populations are more susceptible to random sampling errors in the alleles that get passed to the next generation.\n\nA common rule of thumb in population genetics is used to compare these two forces. Selection is considered the dominant force when its effect is much greater than that of drift, i.e., $s \\gg \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. Conversely, drift is considered dominant when $s \\ll \\frac{1}{2N_e}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the effective population size, $N_e$, at which the influence of genetic drift is equal in magnitude to the force of selection. This represents the threshold where the predictable push from selection is balanced by the random noise from drift. We can find this value by setting the magnitudes of the two forces equal to each other:\n$$s = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$$\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for $N_e$. We can rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by $N_e$ and dividing by $s$:\n$$s \\cdot (2N_e) = 1$$\n$$N_e = \\frac{1}{2s}$$\n\nWe are given the selection coefficient $s = 0.005$. Substituting this value into our derived expression for $N_e$:\n$$N_e = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot (0.005)}$$\n$$N_e = \\frac{1}{0.01}$$\n$$N_e = 100$$\n\nThus, an effective population size of 100 is the point at which the strength of genetic drift equals the strength of selection for this allele. In populations smaller than this, the beneficial allele would be at a significant risk of being lost due to random chance. In populations substantially larger than this, its fate would be primarily determined by its selective advantage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{100}$$", "id": "1492474"}]}
