{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Hardy-Weinberg principle serves as the fundamental null model in population genetics, describing how allele and genotype frequencies remain constant in the absence of other evolutionary influences. This exercise extends the principle to X-linked traits, a common scenario in genetics, requiring you to calculate expected genotype frequencies for both males and females. Mastering this skill is crucial for identifying when real populations might be deviating from equilibrium and thus undergoing evolution [@problem_id:1487856].", "problem": "In a certain large, randomly mating population, the prevalence of a recessive X-linked genetic disorder is being studied. The disorder is controlled by a single gene with two alleles: the dominant allele for the normal phenotype, denoted as $X^A$, and the recessive allele causing the disorder, denoted as $X^a$. The population is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to this X-linked locus. A comprehensive genetic survey of the population's gene pool reveals that the frequency of the recessive disorder-causing allele ($X^a$) is 0.04.\n\nCalculate the expected frequencies of all possible genotypes for both females and males in this population. Your answer should be a set of five decimal values corresponding to the frequencies of the genotypes in the following specific order: homozygous normal females ($X^A X^A$), heterozygous females ($X^A X^a$), homozygous affected females ($X^a X^a$), normal males ($X^A Y$), and affected males ($X^a Y$).", "solution": "Let $p$ denote the frequency of the dominant allele $X^{A}$ and $q$ denote the frequency of the recessive allele $X^{a}$. By definition, $p+q=1$. The problem gives $q=0.04$, hence\n$$\np=1-q=1-0.04=0.96.\n$$\nUnder Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for an X-linked locus in a large, randomly mating population, female genotype frequencies follow the binomial expansion as for autosomal loci:\n$$\nf(X^{A}X^{A})=p^{2},\\quad f(X^{A}X^{a})=2pq,\\quad f(X^{a}X^{a})=q^{2}.\n$$\nMales are hemizygous for the X chromosome, so their genotype frequencies equal the corresponding allele frequencies:\n$$\nf(X^{A}Y)=p,\\quad f(X^{a}Y)=q.\n$$\nSubstituting $p=0.96$ and $q=0.04$,\n$$\nf(X^{A}X^{A})=(0.96)^{2}=0.9216,\\quad f(X^{A}X^{a})=2(0.96)(0.04)=0.0768,\\quad f(X^{a}X^{a})=(0.04)^{2}=0.0016,\n$$\n$$\nf(X^{A}Y)=0.96,\\quad f(X^{a}Y)=0.04.\n$$\nThese five values are reported in the requested order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0.9216 & 0.0768 & 0.0016 & 0.96 & 0.04\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1487856"}, {"introduction": "One of the key assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is random mating. This practice explores a common form of non-random mating—inbreeding—by asking you to calculate the inbreeding coefficient, $F$, for an individual from a known pedigree. Understanding how to quantify inbreeding is vital for conservation genetics and human health, as it measures the probability of inheriting alleles that are identical by descent and can increase the prevalence of rare recessive disorders [@problem_id:1487824].", "problem": "In a small, isolated mountain village, population geneticists are studying the effects of consanguinity on the local gene pool. They are focusing on a particular family lineage. Two individuals, a man and a woman who were unrelated and not inbred, had two children: a son and a daughter. The son went on to have a daughter of his own. The daughter also had a child, a son. These two offspring (the grandchildren of the original couple) are first cousins. The cousins later have a child together.\n\nAssuming no other inbreeding has occurred in this lineage, calculate the inbreeding coefficient ($F$) for this child.

The inbreeding coefficient $F_{X}$ is the probability that the two alleles at a locus in $X$ are identical by descent and equals the kinship coefficient of its parents.
