A key survival trait of this organism is its ability to synthesize a complex antifreeze protein, a characteristic governed by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for high-efficiency protein synthesis, denoted by $A$, is completely dominant over the allele for low-efficiency synthesis, $a$. The low-efficiency phenotype ($aa$) is easily identifiable in culture due to a slower growth rate at freezing temperatures.\n\nIn a large, stable, isolated sample population containing 7,200 individual organisms, the biologists identify 530 individuals that exhibit the low-efficiency phenotype.

The population is known to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A genetic survey reveals the frequencies of these alleles in the population's gene pool are as follows: the frequency of the $C^{R}$ allele is $p=0.5$, the frequency of the $C^{W}$ allele is $q=0.3$, and the frequency of the $C^{Y}$ allele is $r=0.2$. These alleles exhibit a form of incomplete dominance, leading to unique phenotypes for each possible genotype.

Therefore, to find the expected frequency of orange-flowered plants, we need to calculate the frequency of the $C^{R}C^{Y}$ genotype.\n\nThe frequency of the $C^{R}C^{Y}$ genotype is given by the term $2pr$.
