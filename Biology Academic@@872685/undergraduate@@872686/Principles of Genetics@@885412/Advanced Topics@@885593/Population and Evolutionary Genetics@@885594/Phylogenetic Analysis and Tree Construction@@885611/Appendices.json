To root the tree, they include a known, more distantly related species, *Methanococcus outgroup*. The researcher sequences the gene for a ribosomal protein, creates a multiple sequence alignment of the five DNA sequences, and computationally generates the most probable phylogenetic tree.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical support for the branching patterns in this tree, the researcher performs a non-parametric bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates. The final tree shows two key relationships:\n1.  *Halobacterium alpha* and *Halobacterium beta* are sister species, forming a distinct clade. The bootstrap value supporting the node that unites them is 99%.\n2.  This (*alpha*, *beta*) clade is shown to be a sister group to *Halobacterium gamma*.

A bootstrap value is a measure of statistical support for a given clade (a group of organisms descended from a common ancestor) in a phylogenetic tree. It is not a direct measure of probability that the clade is \"true.\"\n\nLet's break down the process and the meaning of the value.\n1.  **The Bootstrap Procedure**: The analysis starts with the original multiple sequence alignment containing the genetic data for the five species. To create one bootstrap replicate, columns (i.e., nucleotide or amino acid sites) from this original alignment are randomly sampled *with replacement* until a new \"pseudoreplicate\" dataset of the same size as the original is formed. Because the sampling is with replacement, some original columns may be present multiple times in the new dataset, while others may be absent.\n2.  **Tree Reconstruction**: This resampling process is repeated many times (in this case, 1,000 times) to generate 1,000 different pseudoreplicate datasets. For each of these 1,000 datasets, a new phylogenetic tree is constructed.\n3.  **Calculating Support**: The bootstrap value for a specific node (representing a clade) in the original tree is the percentage of these 1,000 generated trees that also contain that exact same clade.\n\nIn this problem, the node in question is the one that groups (*Halobacterium alpha*, *Halobacterium beta*) with *Halobacterium gamma*. A bootstrap value of 60% means that this specific grouping appeared in 60% of the trees constructed from the 1,000 pseudoreplicate datasets. Numerically, this corresponds to 0.60 * 1000 = 600 trees. This value reflects how consistently the data, when perturbed by resampling, supports this particular topology. Conventionally, a bootstrap value of 90-100% is considered strong support, 70-90% is moderate support, and below 70% is considered weak support. A value of 60% suggests that this node is not robustly supported by the current dataset.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this understanding.\n\n**A. There is a 60% probability that the evolutionary hypothesis grouping *alpha*, *beta*, and *gamma* together as a monophyletic group is historically correct.**\nThis is a common and critical misconception. Bootstrap analysis is a frequentist statistical method. The value of 60% is a measure of the frequency of recovering a clade under a specific resampling scheme from a given dataset. It is not a Bayesian posterior probability that represents the actual probability of the hypothesis being true. Therefore, this statement is an incorrect interpretation.\n\n**B. When the original dataset of aligned nucleotide sequences was resampled 1,000 times (with replacement) to create 1,000 new datasets, the clade containing *alpha*, *beta*, and *gamma* was also present in the optimal tree constructed from exactly 600 of these new datasets.**\nThis statement accurately describes the procedural and statistical meaning of a 60% bootstrap value from 1,000 replicates. 60 percent of 1,000 is 600. This is the correct definition of the bootstrap value.\n\n**C. The bootstrap value indicates that 60% of the informative nucleotide sites in the ribosomal protein gene alignment directly support the node grouping *alpha*, *beta*, and *gamma* together.**\nThis is incorrect. The bootstrap method does not simply count the proportion of sites supporting a node. It involves creating entirely new datasets through resampling and then building complete trees from them. The support is derived from the frequency of the clade's appearance across these full tree reconstructions, which is a much more complex assessment than just counting sites.\n\n**D. A bootstrap value of 60% is considered statistically weak, which proves that the true evolutionary relationship among *alpha*, *beta*, and *gamma* is a \"hard polytomy,\" meaning all three species diverged from their common ancestor at the exact same point in time.**\nThis statement makes two errors. First, while 60% is weak support, it does not *prove* anything. It indicates a lack of strong evidence from the current data to resolve that node confidently. The true relationship could still be the one shown, but another branching order (e.g., (*alpha*, *gamma*) with *beta*) might also have some support. Second, it incorrectly equates low support for a bifurcating node with proof of a \"hard polytomy\" (a simultaneous divergence event). Lack of resolution in a tree (a \"soft polytomy\") simply means the data is insufficient to determine the branching order; it does not prove the divergences were truly simultaneous. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that provides a technically accurate definition of the bootstrap value presented in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1509063"}]}
