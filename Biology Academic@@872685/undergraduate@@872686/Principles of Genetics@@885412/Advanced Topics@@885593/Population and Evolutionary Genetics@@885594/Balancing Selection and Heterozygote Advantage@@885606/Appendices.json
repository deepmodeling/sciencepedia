The resistance is determined by a single gene locus with two alleles: a resistance allele $R$ and a susceptible allele $r$. The population is large, and mating is random. After several generations of consistent herbicide application across the fields, the population has reached a stable state. Field biologists have measured the relative fitness of the three possible genotypes in this herbicide-treated environment. The relative fitness values are as follows:\n\n-   Homozygous resistant ($RR$): $w_{RR} = 0.85$\n-   Heterozygous ($Rr$): $w_{Rr} = 1.00$\n-   Homozygous susceptible ($rr$): $w_{rr} = 0.20$\n\nCalculate the predicted frequency of the resistance allele, $R$, in this population at equilibrium.
