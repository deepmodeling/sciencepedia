The flower is organized into four concentric whorls. From outermost to innermost, these are: whorl 1 (sepals), whorl 2 (petals), whorl 3 (stamens), and whorl 4 (carpels). The identity of these organs is determined by the combinatorial expression of three classes of MADS-box genes, designated as Class A, Class B, and Class C.\n\nThe rules of the model are as follows:\n1.  Expression of Class A genes alone specifies sepals in whorl 1.\n2.  Co-expression of Class A and Class B genes specifies petals in whorl 2.\n3.  Co-expression of Class B and Class C genes specifies stamens in whorl 3.\n4.  Expression of Class C genes alone specifies carpels in whorl 4.\n5.  Class A and Class C genes are mutually antagonistic: in a whorl where Class A is normally expressed, its loss leads to Class C expression, and vice-versa. Class B expression is not affected by this antagonism and remains confined to whorls 2 and 3.\n\nA botanist discovers a stable mutant plant whose flowers exhibit a consistent and unusual morphology.

A key method for dissecting these pathways is epistasis analysis, which determines the functional order of genes by observing the phenotype of a double mutant. This practice ([@problem_id:1481647]) places you in the role of a *Drosophila* geneticist to predict the outcome of combining mutations in a pair-rule gene and a segment polarity gene, reinforcing how upstream genes in a hierarchy dictate the context in which downstream genes can act.", "problem": "In the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the process of embryonic segmentation is controlled by a hierarchical cascade of genes. This cascade begins with maternally supplied gap genes, which in turn regulate pair-rule genes, and these subsequently control the expression of segment polarity genes. This precise sequence establishes the 14-segment body plan of the larva.\n\nConsider two key genes in this pathway:\n1.  **fushi tarazu (*ftz*)**: A pair-rule gene. Its protein product is a transcription factor expressed in seven stripes, corresponding to the even-numbered parasegments. A complete loss-of-function mutation in *ftz* results in an embryo that lacks all odd-numbered parasegments, leading to a phenotype with only 7 broad segments instead of the wild-type 14.\n2.  **gooseberry (*gsb*)**: A segment polarity gene. It is expressed in the posterior portion of each parasegment and is essential for establishing and maintaining the correct anterior-posterior polarity within each segment. A loss-of-function mutation in *gsb* does not alter the number of segments, but it disrupts the internal organization of all 14, causing defects such as the loss of specific cuticle structures.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a fly strain homozygous for a loss-of-function *ftz* allele is crossed with a strain homozygous for a loss-of-function *gsb* allele to ultimately generate embryos that are homozygous double mutants for both genes (*ftz⁻/ftz⁻ ; gsb⁻/gsb⁻*).\n\nBased on the established genetic hierarchy, which of the following descriptions best predicts the phenotype of these double mutant embryos?\n\nA. The embryo will have 14 segments, but each segment will show the characteristic internal polarity defects of a *gooseberry* single mutant.\n\nB. The embryo will be phenotypically indistinguishable from a *fushi tarazu* single mutant, possessing 7 broad segments with normal internal polarity.\n\nC. The embryo will have only 7 segments, and each of these remaining segments will exhibit the internal polarity defects characteristic of a *gooseberry* mutant.\n\nD. The embryo will be non-viable and fail to show any segmentation whatsoever, arresting development at an early blastoderm stage.\n\nE. The embryo will have 14 segments, but the defects will be additive, resulting in a phenotype more severe than either single mutant, where all segments are fused together.", "solution": "1. Establish the regulatory hierarchy: maternal and gap genes regulate pair-rule genes, which in turn regulate segment polarity genes. Therefore, pair-rule genes act upstream of segment polarity genes in specifying the periodicity (number and position of parasegments), while segment polarity genes act downstream to organize anterior-posterior polarity within each parasegment.\n2. Interpret the single-mutant phenotypes:\n   - Loss of function in the pair-rule gene fushi tarazu (ftz) eliminates alternate parasegments, yielding $7$ broad segments rather than the wild-type $14$.\n   - Loss of function in the segment polarity gene gooseberry (gsb) retains $14$ segments but disrupts the internal polarity of each segment.\n3. Predict the double-mutant outcome using epistasis logic in a linear pathway:\n   - Because ftz is upstream, its loss determines whether parasegments are specified at all. In an ftz mutant background, the odd-numbered parasegments are not established, so downstream segment polarity genes, including gsb, cannot restore or create those missing parasegments. Thus, the total segment count is governed by the ftz phenotype: $7$ segments.\n   - Within the parasegments that are still specified (the ones that remain in the ftz mutant background), gsb acts downstream to establish polarity. A gsb loss of function will therefore manifest as polarity defects specifically in those remaining segments.\n4. Synthesize the prediction: The double mutant will have only $7$ segments (as in ftz), and each of these segments will show the internal polarity defects characteristic of gsb mutants.

While we can now edit genes with precision, predicting the consequences across generations still relies on the fundamental principles of Mendelian inheritance.

Homozygous recessive mutations in this gene, denoted *gon-1(-)/gon-1(-)*, cause complete failure of gonad development, resulting in a sterile phenotype.\n\nThe researcher performs an experiment using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology to induce mutations. A solution containing the CRISPR-Cas9 components targeting *gon-1* is injected into the syncytial gonad of wild-type (WT) P0 hermaphrodites, which have the genotype *gon-1(+)/gon-1(+)*. This injection happens after the P0 animal's own somatic development is complete, so the P0 hermaphrodites are themselves fertile.\n\nThe editing process is not perfectly efficient and creates mosaicism within the P0 germline. Assume that for any given gamete produced by an injected P0 hermaphrodite, the *gon-1(+)* allele has a fixed probability, $E$, of being converted into a non-functional *gon-1(-)* allele. The researcher establishes that this editing efficiency is $E = 0.300$.\n\nThese injected P0 animals are allowed to self-fertilize to produce an F1 generation.
