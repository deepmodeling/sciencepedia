This exercise asks you to predict the outcome of a hypothetical genetic experiment that removes the two key maternal regulators, Bicoid and Nanos. By working through this scenario [@problem_id:1519421], you can solidify your understanding of how these foundational proteins create the initial asymmetric protein gradients through translational repression.", "problem": "In the early development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the primary anterior-posterior axis is established by maternal effect genes. The messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for these genes are deposited into the egg by the mother.\n\nIn a wild-type embryo, the regulation of two key gap gene proteins, Hunchback (Hb) and Caudal (Cad), is as follows:\n- The maternal mRNA for *hunchback* is uniformly distributed throughout the egg.\n- The maternal mRNA for *caudal* is also uniformly distributed throughout the egg.\n- The maternal mRNA for *bicoid* is localized at the anterior pole. The Bicoid protein it encodes forms an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient and acts as a translational repressor of *caudal* mRNA.\n- The maternal mRNA for *nanos* is localized at the posterior pole. The Nanos protein it encodes forms a posterior-to-anterior concentration gradient and acts as a translational repressor of *hunchback* mRNA.\n\nConsider an embryo derived from a female fly that is homozygous for null mutations in both the *bicoid* gene and the *nanos* gene. These mutations result in the complete absence of functional Bicoid and Nanos proteins in the embryo. Which of the following statements best describes the expected distribution of Hunchback and Caudal proteins translated from their maternal mRNAs in this double-mutant embryo?\n\nA. Hunchback protein is uniformly distributed; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed.\n\nB. Hunchback protein forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed.\n\nC. Hunchback protein is uniformly distributed; Caudal protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient.\n\nD.

Hunchback protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed.", "solution": "The problem asks for the protein distribution of Hunchback (Hb) and Caudal (Cad) in an embryo lacking maternal contributions of both Bicoid (Bcd) and Nanos (Nos) proteins. We need to analyze the regulatory functions of Bcd and Nos and determine the consequences of their absence.\n\nFirst, let's establish the wild-type situation as described in the problem statement.\n1.  **Hunchback (Hb) regulation:** The maternal *hunchback* mRNA is uniformly distributed. The Nanos protein, which forms a posterior-to-anterior (P->A) gradient, represses the translation of this mRNA. This repression is strongest at the posterior and weakest at the anterior. Consequently, in a wild-type embryo, Hunchback protein is synthesized primarily in the anterior, forming an anterior-to-posterior (A->P) gradient.\n2.  **Caudal (Cad) regulation:** The maternal *caudal* mRNA is also uniformly distributed. The Bicoid protein, which forms an anterior-to-posterior (A->P) gradient, represses the translation of this mRNA. This repression is strongest at the anterior and weakest at the posterior. As a result, in a wild-type embryo, Caudal protein is synthesized mainly in the posterior, forming a posterior-to-anterior (P->A) gradient.\n\nNow, we consider the specified double-mutant embryo, which comes from a mother homozygous for null mutations in both *bicoid* and *nanos*. This means the embryo will contain no functional Bicoid protein and no functional Nanos protein.\n\nLet's analyze the effect on each protein individually in this mutant background.\n\n**Effect on Hunchback (Hb) protein:**\nIn the wild-type, the translation of the uniform maternal *hunchback* mRNA is repressed in the posterior by the Nanos protein. In the double-mutant embryo, there is no Nanos protein. Therefore, the repression of *hunchback* mRNA translation is completely lifted. Since the maternal *hunchback* mRNA is uniformly distributed throughout the embryo, it will be translated everywhere. This will result in a uniform distribution of Hunchback protein throughout the embryo.\n\n**Effect on Caudal (Cad) protein:**\nIn the wild-type, the translation of the uniform maternal *caudal* mRNA is repressed in the anterior by the Bicoid protein. In the double-mutant embryo, there is no Bicoid protein. Therefore, the repression of *caudal* mRNA translation is also completely lifted. Since the maternal *caudal* mRNA is uniformly distributed, it will be translated everywhere. This will result in a uniform distribution of Caudal protein throughout the embryo.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn an embryo lacking both maternal Bicoid and Nanos function, the repressors for both *caudal* and *hunchback* mRNA translation are absent. Both uniformly distributed maternal mRNAs will be translated freely along the entire anterior-posterior axis. Thus, both Hunchback protein and Caudal protein will be uniformly distributed.\n\nComparing this outcome with the given choices:\n- A. Hunchback protein is uniformly distributed; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed. - This matches our conclusion.\n- B. Hunchback protein forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed. - This describes a *bicoid* single mutant.\n- C. Hunchback protein is uniformly distributed; Caudal protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient. - This describes a *nanos* single mutant.\n- D. Hunchback protein forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient; Caudal protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient. - This describes the wild-type condition.\n- E. No Hunchback protein is present; no Caudal protein is present. - This is incorrect; the maternal mRNAs are present and Bicoid/Nanos are repressors, not activators, of translation.\n- F. Hunchback protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed. - This pattern is not expected from the known regulatory network.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that both proteins are uniformly distributed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1519421"}, {"introduction": "Once the broad regions of the embryo are defined by gap genes, the pair-rule genes take over to divide the embryo into smaller, repeating units. The primary pair-rule genes, *even-skipped* and *fushi tarazu*, are famous for their beautiful seven-stripe expression patterns. This practice problem [@problem_id:1519428] challenges you to visualize the spatial relationship between these two sets of stripes, which is critical for understanding how the embryo establishes the foundation for its 14 segments.", "problem": "In the early development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, a hierarchical cascade of gene expression establishes the segmented body plan. This process begins with maternal effect genes, which establish broad gradients along the anterior-posterior axis. These gradients, in turn, regulate the expression of zygotic genes, including gap genes, pair-rule genes, and segment polarity genes.\n\nThe pair-rule genes are responsible for dividing the embryo into a repeating series of units. The two primary pair-rule genes, *even-skipped* (*eve*) and *fushi tarazu* (*ftz*), are transcription factors expressed in seven distinct transverse stripes each along the embryo's length during the syncytial blastoderm stage. The expression of each individual stripe is controlled by different combinations of upstream gap gene proteins.\n\nImagine a developmental biologist performs a double-label immunofluorescence experiment on a wild-type *Drosophila* embryo. This technique allows for the simultaneous visualization of the protein products of both the *eve* gene (Eve protein) and the *ftz* gene (Ftz protein) within the same embryo. Based on your understanding of the function and mechanism of pair-rule genes, what would be the observed spatial relationship between the seven Eve stripes and the seven Ftz stripes?\n\nA. The seven Eve stripes will precisely co-localize with the seven Ftz stripes, such that the Eve and Ftz proteins are found together within the nuclei of the same cells.\n\nB. The seven Eve stripes will be positioned along the anterior-posterior axis, but the seven Ftz stripes will be positioned along the dorsal-ventral axis, forming a grid-like pattern.\n\nC. The seven Eve stripes and the seven Ftz stripes are expressed in adjacent but non-overlapping sets of cells, creating an alternating pattern where a stripe of Ftz-expressing cells is located immediately next to a stripe of Eve-expressing cells.\n\nD. The Eve stripes form in the anterior half of the embryo, and the Ftz stripes form in the posterior half, with no stripes from either gene appearing in the opposite half.", "solution": "The establishment of the Drosophila anterior-posterior pattern proceeds hierarchically: maternal effect gradients regulate gap genes, which in turn regulate pair-rule genes. Each primary pair-rule gene, including eve and ftz, is expressed in seven transverse stripes along the anterior-posterior axis during the syncytial blastoderm stage. The position and width of each stripe are set by stripe-specific enhancers that integrate combinatorial inputs from upstream gap proteins.\n\nA key mechanistic principle of the pair-rule network is that eve and ftz represent out-of-phase patterns with double-segment periodicity. Stripe-specific enhancers for eve and ftz respond to distinct combinations and thresholds of gap gene inputs, positioning their respective stripes at alternating positions. Furthermore, Eve functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor and contributes to sharpening boundaries by repressing neighboring pair-rule gene expression, including limiting ftz expression at stripe borders. As a result, co-expression of Eve and Ftz within the same nuclei is minimized, and their stripes abut rather than overlap.\n\nTherefore, in a double-label immunofluorescence of a wild-type embryo, both Eve and Ftz are visualized as seven transverse stripes along the anterior-posterior axis, but these stripes are arranged in an alternating, complementary pattern. This rules out precise co-localization (contradicting their known out-of-phase expression), eliminates dorsal-ventral grid-like arrangements (pair-rule stripes are not patterned along the dorsal-ventral axis), and rejects a strict anterior-vs-posterior partition (both genes span the length of the embryo in periodic stripes). The correct spatial relationship is adjacent, non-overlapping stripes forming an alternating pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1519428"}, {"introduction": "The segmentation gene cascade is defined by its hierarchical nature, where genes in one tier regulate the expression of genes in the next.

By predicting the phenotypic ratios [@problem_id:1519443], you can demonstrate your understanding of how a disruption early in the hierarchy (a gap gene mutation) can mask the effects of a disruption later in the process (a segment polarity gene mutation).", "problem": "In *Drosophila melanogaster*, the proper segmentation of the embryo is controlled by a cascade of genes. Among these are the gap genes and the segment polarity genes. Consider two such genes: *Krüppel* (Kr), a gap gene, and *wingless* (wg), a segment polarity gene. For both genes, the wild-type alleles, denoted `$Kr^+$` and `$wg^+$` respectively, are dominant over the recessive null alleles, `$Kr^-$` and `$wg^-$`. Both genes are located on different autosomes and thus assort independently.\n\nEmbryos that are homozygous for a null allele of either gene (`$Kr^-/Kr^-$` or `$wg^-/wg^-$`) fail to develop correctly and die before hatching, but they form a larval cuticle whose phenotype can be analyzed. The phenotypic expression is determined by the following rules:\n1.  An embryo with at least one `$Kr^+$` allele and at least one `$wg^+$` allele develops a wild-type cuticle.\n2.  An embryo with at least one `$Kr^+$` allele but homozygous for the `$wg^-$` allele (e.g., `$Kr^+/Kr^- ; wg^-/wg^-$`) develops the \"wingless\" phenotype, characterized by specific defects within each body segment.\n3.  An embryo homozygous for the `$Kr^-$` allele (`$Kr^-/Kr^-$`) develops the \"Krüppel\" phenotype, which involves the loss of a large block of central body segments. This severe defect in the body plan governed by the gap gene is established early in development and completely masks any potential effects from the *wingless* gene. Therefore, any embryo with the genotype `$Kr^-/Kr^-$` exhibits the \"Krüppel\" phenotype, regardless of its genotype at the *wingless* locus.\n\nSuppose two flies, both heterozygous for null alleles of both genes (`$Kr^+/Kr^- ; wg^+/wg^-$`), are crossed.
