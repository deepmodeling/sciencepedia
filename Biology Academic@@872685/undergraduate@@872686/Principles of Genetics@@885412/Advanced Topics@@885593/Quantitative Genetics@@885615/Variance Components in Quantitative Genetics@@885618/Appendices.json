This problem demonstrates how to use previously determined variance components to forecast how a population will perform in a different setting. By calculating the genetic variance ($V_G$) in one environment, you can predict the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) for the same population in a new environment with a different level of environmental influence ($V_E$), assuming no genotype-by-environment interaction [@problem_id:1534325].", "problem": "A team of agronomists is studying a genetically variable population of a new soybean cultivar. They are interested in the quantitative trait of seed pod weight. In a highly controlled greenhouse environment where all plants receive identical light, water, and nutrients, the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) for seed pod weight is measured to be $24.0 \\text{ g}^2$. To dissect the components of this variance, the researchers generate a genetically uniform population by repeatedly self-pollinating one of the plants until it is completely homozygous and then propagating it clonally.

The equation relating them is:\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E + V_{G \\times E}$$\nThe problem states that we can assume the genotype-by-environment interaction ($V_{G \\times E}$) is zero. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E$$\n\nFirst, we analyze the data from the controlled greenhouse environment. Let's denote the variance components in this environment with the subscript \"greenhouse\".\n\nWe are given the total phenotypic variance for the genetically variable population in the greenhouse:\n$$V_{P, \\text{greenhouse}} = 24.0 \\text{ g}^2$$\n\nNext, a genetically uniform population is grown in the same greenhouse. For a genetically uniform population, there is no genetic variation among individuals, so the genetic variance ($V_G$) is zero by definition.

Therefore, the variance measured in the genetically uniform population is equal to the environmental variance of the greenhouse.\n$$V_{E, \\text{greenhouse}} = 6.0 \\text{ g}^2$$\n\nNow we can calculate the genetic variance ($V_G$) of the original genetically variable population. The genetic variance is an intrinsic property of this population and is assumed to be constant across the environments in this problem.
