Their experiment begins with two true-breeding parental lines that differ significantly in height; one line is consistently short, and the other is consistently tall. They cross these two parental lines to produce a genetically uniform F1 generation. Subsequently, they allow the F1 plants to self-pollinate, which results in a genetically segregating F2 generation. Both the F1 and F2 populations are cultivated in a single, homogeneous field to ensure that all plants experience nearly identical environmental conditions.\n\nAfter the plants reach maturity, the final height of a large and representative sample from each population is measured. From these measurements, the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) for plant height is calculated for each generation.
