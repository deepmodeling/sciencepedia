{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our exploration of extranuclear inheritance begins with a crucial distinction: the difference between a maternal effect and true cytoplasmic inheritance. A maternal effect occurs when the mother's nuclear genotype provides gene products to the egg that determine the offspring's early developmental phenotype, a principle beautifully illustrated by snail shell coiling. This problem [@problem_id:1488026] challenges you to disentangle the mother's genetic influence from the offspring's own genotype to solve a classic genetic puzzle.", "problem": "In the pond snail *Lymnaea peregra*, the direction of shell coiling is a classic example of a trait determined by maternal effect. The allele for dextral (right-handed) coiling, denoted by `$D$`, is dominant to the allele for sinistral (left-handed) coiling, denoted by `$d$`. The phenotype of an individual snail is not determined by its own genotype, but rather by the nuclear genotype of its mother. The gene products from the mother's genome are deposited into the oocyte cytoplasm and direct the orientation of the first mitotic spindle cleavage in the zygote, thereby irreversibly establishing the offspring's coiling pattern.\n\nA biologist is studying a population of these snails and isolates an individual that exhibits a dextral shell. A subsequent genetic analysis reveals that this specific snail's own genotype is homozygous recessive (`$dd$`).\n\nBased on this information, which of the following must have been the genotype of this dextral snail's mother?\n\nA. `$DD$`\n\nB. `$Dd$`\n\nC. `$dd$`\n\nD. The phenotype is a result of cytoplasmic inheritance from maternal mitochondria, so the nuclear genotype is irrelevant.\n\nE. The mother's genotype cannot be determined without knowing the father's genotype.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires a careful application of the principles of maternal effect inheritance.\n\nStep 1: Understand the inheritance pattern. The problem states that in *Lymnaea peregra*, the shell coiling phenotype of an offspring is determined by the genotype of its mother, not its own genotype. The allele for dextral coiling (`$D$`) is dominant over the allele for sinistral coiling (`$d$`).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the offspring's phenotype. The snail in question has a dextral (right-handed) shell. Because this phenotype is determined by the mother's genotype, the mother must possess at least one dominant `$D$` allele to produce the gene products that lead to dextral coiling. This narrows down the mother's possible genotypes to `$DD$` or `$Dd$`. A mother with a `$dd$` genotype would only produce sinistral (left-handed) offspring.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the offspring's genotype. The problem states that the dextral snail's own genotype is `$dd$`. Like any diploid organism, this snail inherited one allele from its mother and one allele from its father. Since its genotype is `$dd$`, it must have received a `$d$` allele from its mother and a `$d$` allele from its father.\n\nStep 4: Synthesize the information to determine the mother's genotype. From Step 2, we concluded the mother's genotype must be `$DD$` or `$Dd$` to produce a dextral offspring. From Step 3, we concluded that the mother must have passed on a `$d$` allele to this specific offspring. A mother with a `$DD$` genotype could not pass on a `$d$` allele. Therefore, the only genotype that satisfies both conditions—having a `$D$` allele to determine the dextral phenotype and having a `$d$` allele to pass on to the offspring—is `$Dd$`.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. `$DD$`: This is incorrect. A `$DD$` mother would produce a dextral offspring, but she could not have a `$dd$` offspring, as she can only pass on a `$D$` allele.\n- B. `$Dd$`: This is correct. A mother with genotype `$Dd$` has the dominant `$D$` allele, so all her offspring will be dextral. She also carries a recessive `$d$` allele, which she can pass on to her offspring. If she mates with a male carrying a `$d$` allele (genotype `$Dd$` or `$dd$`), it is possible for them to produce an offspring with the `$dd$` genotype.\n- C. `$dd$`: This is incorrect. A mother with a `$dd$` genotype would produce gene products for sinistral coiling, so all her offspring would be sinistral, regardless of their own genotype.\n- D. This statement is incorrect. Maternal effect is distinct from mitochondrial (cytoplasmic) inheritance. Maternal effect involves the expression of the mother's *nuclear* genes, whose products are stored in the egg cytoplasm and influence the offspring's early development.\n- E. This statement is incorrect. The father's genotype contributes an allele to the offspring's genotype, but it has no influence on the offspring's phenotype (shell coiling). The provided information about the offspring's phenotype and genotype is sufficient to uniquely determine the mother's genotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1488026"}, {"introduction": "Having distinguished maternal effects, we now turn to true cytoplasmic inheritance, where traits are determined by genes located in organellar genomes, such as mitochondrial DNA. The yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* provides a powerful model for studying these non-Mendelian patterns, as demonstrated by the 'petite' phenotype. This exercise [@problem_id:1488034] examines the outcome of a cross involving a 'suppressive' petite mutant, forcing you to predict inheritance patterns when organellar genomes compete.", "problem": "In the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, the ability to carry out aerobic respiration is dependent on functional mitochondria. Strains with functional mitochondria are called \"grande\" ($\\left[\\rho^+\\right]$) and form large colonies. Strains with defective mitochondrial DNA leading to a loss of respiratory function are called \"petite\".\n\nOne class of petite mutants is known as \"suppressive petites\" ($\\left[\\rho^-\\text{S}\\right]$). These mutants contain aberrant mitochondrial DNA which, upon mating with a wild-type grande strain, rapidly outcompetes and eliminates the wild-type mitochondrial DNA in the resulting diploid cell lineage. This suppressive effect is highly efficient, approaching 100% replacement in the culture.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a haploid suppressive petite strain ($\\left[\\rho^-\\text{S}\\right]$) is crossed with a haploid grande strain ($\\left[\\rho^+\\right]$). The resulting diploid zygotes are isolated, allowed to divide mitotically to form a stable diploid culture, and then induced to undergo meiosis. The phenotypes of the diploid culture and the resulting haploid meiotic spores are then analyzed.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the expected phenotypic outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The diploid culture is grande, and the meiotic spores segregate in a 2 grande : 2 petite ratio.\nB. The diploid culture is petite, and the meiotic spores segregate in a 2 grande : 2 petite ratio.\nC. The diploid culture is grande, and all four meiotic spores are grande.\nD. The diploid culture is petite, and all four meiotic spores are petite.\nE. The diploid culture is a mix of grande and petite cells, and the meiotic spores segregate in a 1 grande : 3 petite ratio.", "solution": "We identify the relevant biological principles and apply them step by step.\n\n1) Mitochondrial inheritance in yeast is cytoplasmic, not Mendelian. Thus, phenotypes controlled by mitochondrial DNA do not segregate in a 2:2 ratio in meiosis unless a nuclear gene is responsible. Respiratory competence (grande versus petite) in this context is determined by mitochondrial DNA state, not by nuclear alleles.\n\n2) Suppressive petite strains, denoted $\\left[\\rho^-\\text{S}\\right]$, carry aberrant mitochondrial DNA that, when combined with wild-type mitochondrial DNA $\\left[\\rho^+\\right]$ in a zygote, outcompetes and replaces the wild-type mitochondrial DNA. The problem states this suppressive replacement is highly efficient, approaching complete (effectively 1) replacement in the culture.\n\n3) In the cross $\\left[\\rho^-\\text{S}\\right] \\times \\left[\\rho^+\\right]$, the initial diploid zygote receives mitochondria from both parents. Due to the suppressive property, during the early mitotic divisions that establish the diploid culture, the $\\left[\\rho^-\\text{S}\\right]$ mitochondrial genomes take over, eliminating the $\\left[\\rho^+\\right]$ genomes. Therefore, the stable diploid culture becomes petite (respiration-deficient).\n\n4) Upon inducing meiosis in a diploid that is already homoplasmic (or effectively homoplasmic) for $\\left[\\rho^-\\text{S}\\right]$, all four haploid spores inherit the cytoplasm containing only suppressive petite mitochondria. Because the mitochondrial determinant is cytoplasmic and already uniform in the diploid, there is no 2:2 segregation. All meiotic products are petite.\n\n5) Therefore, the correct phenotypic outcome is: the diploid culture is petite, and all four meiotic spores are petite.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. Options A and B incorrectly imply Mendelian 2:2 segregation for a mitochondrial phenotype. Option C assumes persistence of $\\left[\\rho^+\\right]$ despite suppression, which contradicts the suppressive takeover. Option E predicts a mixed diploid culture and a 1:3 segregation, neither of which is expected given suppressive dominance and cytoplasmic inheritance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1488034"}, {"introduction": "The principles of mitochondrial inheritance have profound implications for human health, but the patterns of mitochondrial diseases are often complex due to concepts like heteroplasmy and the genetic bottleneck.
