The disorder is known to be caused by a point mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The analysis focuses on a specific three-generation family. Assume the disorder shows complete penetrance, meaning any individual who inherits the causative mutation will express the trait.\n\nThe family history is as follows:\n\nIn Generation I, an affected female (I-2) partners with an unaffected male (I-1).\n\nIn Generation II, they have three children: a daughter (II-2), a son (II-3), and another daughter (II-4).\n- The daughter (II-2) partners with an unaffected male (II-1).

All individuals in Generation III are unaffected.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine which individuals in the third generation of a family will be affected by a disorder caused by a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).\n\nThe fundamental principle of mitochondrial inheritance is that mitochondria, and thus mtDNA, are passed down exclusively through the maternal line. An egg cell contains a large number of mitochondria in its cytoplasm, while a sperm cell contributes very few, if any, mitochondria to the resulting zygote. Therefore, all offspring—male and female—inherit their mitochondrial genome solely from their mother. A male can be affected by a mitochondrial disorder, but he cannot pass it on to any of his children.\n\nLet's trace the inheritance pattern generation by generation.\n\n**Generation I:**\n- I-1 is an unaffected male.\n- I-2 is an affected female. She is the source of the mitochondrial mutation in this pedigree.\n\n**Generation II:**\n- All children of the founding couple (I-1 and I-2) will inherit their mtDNA from their mother, I-2.\n- Since I-2 is affected, all of her children will inherit the mutated mtDNA and will also be affected by the disorder (given complete penetrance).\n- Therefore, II-2 (daughter), II-3 (son), and II-4 (daughter) are all affected.\n\n**Generation III:**\nNow we analyze the children of the affected individuals in Generation II.\n\n- **Children of II-2 and II-1:**\n    - II-2 is an affected female. She will pass her mitochondria to all of her children.\n    - Her children are III-1 (son) and III-2 (daughter).\n    - Both III-1 and III-2 will inherit the mutated mtDNA from their mother (II-2) and will be affected.\n\n- **Child of II-3 and II-5:**\n    - II-3 is an affected male.\n    - Males do not transmit their mtDNA to their offspring. His child, III-3, will inherit her mtDNA from her unaffected mother, II-5.\n    - Therefore, III-3 (daughter) will be unaffected.\n\n- **Children of II-4 and II-6:**\n    - II-4 is an affected female. She will pass her mitochondria to all of her children.\n    - Her children are III-4 (son) and III-5 (daughter).\n    - Both III-4 and III-5 will inherit the mutated mtDNA from their mother (II-4) and will be affected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the individuals affected in Generation III are III-1, III-2, III-4, and III-5. The individual III-3 is unaffected because her father was the carrier of the mitochondrial mutation, and fathers do not pass on their mitochondria.\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA.

This problem explores why a mother with mild symptoms can have children with drastically different clinical outcomes, from severely affected to completely asymptomatic. The concepts of heteroplasmy and the \"mitochondrial bottleneck\" during egg formation are key to unraveling this puzzle and appreciating the role of chance in genetic inheritance [@problem_id:1503454].", "problem": "A physician is examining a family with a history of a rare mitochondrial disorder. The mother exhibits very mild symptoms of the disease, such as slight muscle weakness after exertion. Genetic testing confirms she is heteroplasmic for a pathogenic mutation in her mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), meaning that her somatic cells contain a mixture of both wild-type (normal) and mutant mtDNA molecules. She has two children, a son and a daughter. The son is severely affected by the disorder, requiring constant medical care, while the daughter is entirely asymptomatic and shows no signs of the disease.\n\nAssuming no new mutations occurred, which of the following provides the most accurate explanation for the dramatic difference in clinical severity observed between the two siblings?\n\nA. Random segregation of mitochondria into developing oocytes during meiosis, leading to a variable proportion of mutant mtDNA in each egg cell.\n\nB.

Paternal leakage, where the father's sperm contributed a significant but variable number of mitochondria to each zygote.\n\nE. Recombination between mutant and wild-type mtDNA molecules, creating a non-pathogenic version of the mitochondrial genome for the daughter.", "solution": "The problem describes a classic case of variable expressivity in a mitochondrial disease due to heteroplasmy and the mechanism of mitochondrial inheritance. Let's analyze the core principles and evaluate each option.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n1.  **Maternal Inheritance:** Mitochondria, and therefore mtDNA, are inherited almost exclusively from the mother. The cytoplasm of the egg cell (oocyte) contains thousands of mitochondria, while the sperm contributes virtually none to the resulting zygote.\n2.  **Heteroplasmy:** This is the state of having a mixture of more than one type of mtDNA within a single cell or individual. In this case, the mother has both wild-type and mutant mtDNA.\n3.  **Phenotypic Threshold:** For most mitochondrial diseases, symptoms only appear when the percentage of mutant mtDNA in a given tissue exceeds a certain critical threshold. The severity of the symptoms often correlates with the proportion of mutant mtDNA. The mother has mild symptoms, indicating her proportion of mutant mtDNA is likely just above the threshold in relevant tissues.\n\n**Mechanism of Variable Inheritance: The Mitochondrial Bottleneck**\nDuring oogenesis (the formation of an egg cell), the population of mitochondria that will be passed on to the mature oocyte undergoes a drastic reduction. From a large pool of mitochondria in the primordial germ cell, a much smaller, randomly selected subset populates the developing oocyte. This phenomenon is known as the \"mitochondrial bottleneck.\"\n\nBecause the selection of mitochondria passing through this bottleneck is a stochastic (random) process, the proportion of mutant mtDNA in the resulting oocyte can be very different from the proportion in the mother's somatic cells.\n-   If, by chance, the oocyte receives a high percentage of mutant mtDNA, the resulting child will be severely affected (like the son).\n-   If, by chance, the oocyte receives a very low percentage (or zero) mutant mtDNA, the resulting child will be asymptomatic (like the daughter).\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n-   **A. Random segregation of mitochondria into developing oocytes during meiosis, leading to a variable proportion of mutant mtDNA in each egg cell.** This option correctly describes the mitochondrial bottleneck effect. The random partitioning of mitochondria during oogenesis is the key mechanism that explains how a heteroplasmic mother can produce offspring with widely varying levels of mutant mtDNA and, consequently, a wide range of clinical severities. This is the correct explanation.\n\n-   **B. Standard Mendelian dominant inheritance, where the son inherited the disease allele and the daughter inherited the recessive allele.** This is incorrect. Mendelian genetics describes the inheritance of nuclear genes located on chromosomes, which segregate in predictable ratios. Mitochondrial DNA is located in the cytoplasm and does not follow Mendelian rules.\n\n-   **C. The disease is X-linked, and the mother is a carrier; the son inherited the affected X chromosome while the daughter inherited the normal X chromosome.** This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states that the mutation is in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), not on the X chromosome, which is a nuclear chromosome. X-linked inheritance patterns are distinct from mitochondrial inheritance patterns.\n\n-   **D. Paternal leakage, where the father's sperm contributed a significant but variable number of mitochondria to each zygote.** This is incorrect. While extremely rare cases of paternal mtDNA transmission have been reported, it is not the standard mechanism of inheritance and would not be the primary explanation for this common phenomenon in mitochondrial genetics. The vast majority of mitochondrial inheritance is strictly maternal.\n\n-   **E. Recombination between mutant and wild-type mtDNA molecules, creating a non-pathogenic version of the mitochondrial genome for the daughter.** This is incorrect. While some evidence for limited recombination in mtDNA exists, it is rare and not the established mechanism for the large-scale shifts in heteroplasmy levels seen between generations. The primary mechanism is the bottleneck effect due to random segregation of whole mitochondrial organelles, not recombination of the DNA within them.\n\nTherefore, the variation in severity between the siblings is best explained by the random sampling of the mother's mitochondria during oogenesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1503454"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its role in disease, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a powerful tool for evolutionary biologists and anthropologists. This thought experiment compares the rate of genetic change in a mitochondrial region versus a nuclear gene, revealing why mtDNA serves as a \"molecular clock\" for tracing human ancestry. This practice bridges cellular genetics with evolutionary principles, highlighting how different parts of our genome evolve at different speeds due to functional constraints and a molecular environments [@problem_id:1503461].", "problem": "A molecular anthropologist is investigating the genetic divergence between two ancient human populations that have been geographically isolated for thousands of years. From one representative individual from each population, the researcher sequences two DNA fragments of identical length, 500 base pairs.\n\nRegion 1 is a segment of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) within the mitochondrial D-loop.\nRegion 2 is a segment of an exon from the nuclear gene *HIST1H2A*, which codes for the core histone protein H2A.\n\nThe researcher counts the number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), which are differences at a single DNA base position, between the two individuals for each region. Let $N_{mt}$ be the number of SNPs found in Region 1 and $N_{nuc}$ be the number of SNPs found in Region 2.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this comparison and provides the correct underlying biological reasoning?\n\nA. $N_{mt} > N_{nuc}$ is expected because the mitochondrial genome is exposed to more mutagens from oxidative phosphorylation and has less efficient DNA repair mechanisms than the nuclear genome. Furthermore, the D-loop is a non-coding region and is under weaker selective pressure than a protein-coding histone gene exon.\n\nB. $N_{mt} > N_{nuc}$ is expected because mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) undergoes frequent recombination during meiosis, which generates a higher number of polymorphisms compared to nuclear DNA which only recombines within chromosome pairs.\n\nC. $N_{nuc} > N_{mt}$ is expected because the nuclear genome is much larger than the mitochondrial genome, and thus has a proportionally higher overall mutation rate. Biparental inheritance of nuclear DNA also introduces more variation compared to the maternal inheritance of mtDNA.\n\nD. $N_{nuc} > N_{mt}$ is expected because nuclear DNA replication and repair systems are known to be more error-prone than the highly efficient and specialized DNA repair systems found within the mitochondria.\n\nE. $N_{mt} \\approx N_{nuc}$ is expected because the fundamental rate of spontaneous mutation is a biological constant, acting as a \"molecular clock\". Therefore, two regions of the same length should accumulate a similar number of mutations over the same period of time, regardless of their location in the genome.", "solution": "Let both sequenced fragments have equal length $L=500$ base pairs. For a given region with per-site substitution rate $r$ and divergence time $t$ per lineage, the expected pairwise number of differences is proportional to the product of length and the total branch length, so for small divergences one can write\n$$\nE[N] \\approx 2 r t \\, L.\n$$\nThus, for two regions of equal length and the same divergence time, the region with the larger per-site substitution rate will yield the larger expected SNP count. Therefore the comparison reduces to the inequality $r_{mt}$ versus $r_{nuc}$ for the two chosen regions.\n\nFor mitochondrial HVR1 within the D-loop, two factors elevate $r_{mt}$: first, the mitochondrial genome is exposed to reactive oxygen species generated by oxidative phosphorylation and lacks protective histones and has less efficient DNA repair relative to the nucleus, leading to a higher underlying point mutation rate per site, $\\mu_{mt} > \\mu_{nuc}$. Second, the D-loop HVR1 is non-coding and hypervariable, so purifying selection is weak; the effective substitution rate $r$ reflects both mutation and the probability that a mutation is not purged, which is high in such non-coding hypervariable regions. In contrast, an exon of a core histone gene such as HIST1H2A is subject to strong purifying selection due to its essential protein function; many mutations are deleterious and are removed, reducing the effective per-site substitution rate $r_{nuc}$. Symbolically, if $r = \\mu \\cdot f_{\\text{fix}}$, then for HVR1 $f_{\\text{fix,mt}}$ is relatively large (near neutral), while for a histone exon $f_{\\text{fix,nuc}} \\ll 1$, hence $r_{mt} \\gg r_{nuc}$, and thus\n$$\nE[N_{mt}] \\approx 2 r_{mt} t L > 2 r_{nuc} t L \\approx E[N_{nuc}].\n$$\nEvaluating the options: A correctly states $N_{mt} > N_{nuc}$ and gives the accurate biological reasons: higher mitochondrial mutagen exposure and less efficient repair increase $\\mu_{mt}$, and weaker constraint in the non-coding D-loop increases the realized substitution rate relative to a conserved histone exon. B is incorrect because mtDNA recombination is not a routine mechanism in humans and, in any case, recombination does not increase the per-site mutation rate that determines $N$ for a single pairwise comparison. C is incorrect because genome size does not determine the per-site mutation or substitution rate for a specific 500 bp region, and biparental inheritance does not increase the per-site divergence in a highly constrained exon; moreover, per-site mutation rates are typically higher in mtDNA. D is incorrect because nuclear DNA repair is generally more efficient than mitochondrial, making mitochondria more error-prone. E is incorrect because there is no single universal per-site mutation or substitution rate; rates and selective constraints differ between genomic compartments and functional categories, so equal-length regions can accumulate different numbers of differences.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1503461"}]}
