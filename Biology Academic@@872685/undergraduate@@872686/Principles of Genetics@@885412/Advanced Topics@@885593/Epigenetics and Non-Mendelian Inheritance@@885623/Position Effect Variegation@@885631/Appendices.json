The silencing effect of heterochromatin is not an all-or-nothing switch but rather a gradient of influence that weakens with distance. This first practice challenges you to apply this core principle to predict the outcome of two different chromosomal rearrangements, reinforcing the link between a gene's physical location and its likelihood of expression [@problem_id:1511740].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the phenomenon of Position Effect Variegation (PEV) in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. PEV occurs when a gene normally located in a transcriptionally active region (euchromatin) is moved to a location near a transcriptionally silent, condensed region (heterochromatin) due to a chromosomal rearrangement. This can lead to the stochastic silencing of the gene in some cells, resulting in a mosaic phenotype.\n\nThe geneticist is working with the *white* gene, where the wild-type allele, $w^+$, is required for the production of red eye pigment, and the recessive null allele, $w$, results in white eyes. Using radiation mutagenesis, the geneticist induces two different stable chromosomal inversions on the X chromosome in two separate fly lines. Both lines are homozygous for the $w^+$ allele.\n\n- **Line A:** Has an inversion that relocates the $w^+$ gene to a new position that is 10 kilobases (kb) away from the boundary of the large block of pericentromeric heterochromatin.\n- **Line B:** Has an inversion that relocates the $w^+$ gene to a new position that is 200 kb away from the boundary of the same pericentromeric heterochromatin.\n\nAssuming all other genetic and environmental factors are identical, which of the following outcomes is most likely?\n\nA. The flies from Line A will exhibit more extreme variegation (i.e., a larger proportion of white patches in their eyes) than the flies from Line B.\n\nB. The flies from Line B will exhibit more extreme variegation (i.e., a larger proportion of white patches in their eyes) than the flies from Line A.\n\nC. Both lines will exhibit a similar, high degree of variegation, as the mere proximity to heterochromatin is sufficient to induce maximum silencing.\n\nD. Both lines will exhibit a fully red-eyed phenotype, as the $w^+$ gene is not located directly within the heterochromatin itself.\n\nE. It is impossible to predict the outcome, as the silencing in PEV is a completely random process unrelated to genomic distance.", "solution": "Position Effect Variegation (PEV) arises when a gene normally in euchromatin is relocated near heterochromatin; the condensed heterochromatin can stochastically spread into adjacent euchromatic regions during development, silencing the nearby gene in a subset of cells. The result is a mosaic phenotype when the gene affects a visible trait.\n\nPrinciple used: The probability that heterochromatin spreading silences a gene decreases as the genomic distance from the heterochromatin boundary increases. Let $p(d)$ denote the probability that the gene is silenced in a given cell when the gene lies at genomic distance $d$ from the heterochromatin boundary. Empirically and mechanistically, $p(d)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $d$, so that if $d_{1} < d_{2}$, then $p(d_{1}) > p(d_{2})$.\n\nApplication to the two lines:\n- Line A places $w^+$ at a smaller distance $d_{A}$ from the heterochromatin boundary than Line B, with $d_{A} = 10$ and $d_{B} = 200$ (kilobases). Therefore $d_{A} < d_{B}$ implies $p(d_{A}) > p(d_{B})$.\n- The expected fraction of cells in which $w^+$ is silenced (and hence produce white patches) is higher in Line A than in Line B. More silencing yields a larger proportion of white patches (more extreme variegation).\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- Option B contradicts the distance dependence of PEV spreading.\n- Option C is incorrect because variegation severity scales with distance rather than saturating simply by proximity.\n- Option D is incorrect because proximity without direct insertion into heterochromatin can still induce PEV.\n- Option E is incorrect because, while silencing is stochastic at the cell level, its overall frequency is predictably influenced by genomic distance.\n\nThus, the flies from Line A will show more extreme variegation than those from Line B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1511740"}, {"introduction": "Beyond physical distance, PEV is dynamically regulated by a suite of proteins that build and maintain chromatin structure. Geneticists can identify these key players by looking for mutations that enhance or suppress the variegating phenotype. This exercise explores the effect of a *Suppressor of variegation* (*Su(var)*) mutation, allowing you to predict how compromising the heterochromatin machinery alters the final phenotype of an organism [@problem_id:1511736].", "problem": "In the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the wild-type allele of the *white* gene ($w^+$) is required for the production of red eye pigment, while null mutations ($w$) result in white eyes. A classic genetic phenomenon known as Position Effect Variegation (PEV) can occur when a chromosomal rearrangement, such as an inversion, moves the $w^+$ gene from its typical euchromatic environment to a new location adjacent to a block of pericentromeric heterochromatin. In this new context, the condensed heterochromatin structure can stochastically spread and silence the $w^+$ gene in some cell lineages during eye development, but not in others. This results in a mosaic eye with patches of red cells (where $w^+$ is expressed) and patches of white cells (where $w^+$ is silenced).\n\nA geneticist is studying a male fly that carries an X-chromosome inversion known to cause a variegated eye phenotype. This male is also heterozygous for a dominant, strong loss-of-function mutation in an autosomal gene known as *Suppressor of variegation 3-9* (*Su(var)3-9*), whose protein product is a histone methyltransferase essential for establishing the heterochromatic state. The fly was raised at a constant temperature of 25°C.\n\nGiven this genetic background, which of the following options most accurately predicts the eye phenotype of this male fly?\n\nA. The eye will be almost entirely white, with only a few small specks of red tissue.\n\nB. The eye will exhibit a classic variegated pattern with roughly equal-sized patches of red and white tissue.\n\nC. The eye will be almost entirely red, with very few or no white patches.\n\nD. The fly will have one completely red eye and one completely white eye.\n\nE. The eye will have a fine-grained \"salt-and-pepper\" appearance, with individual cells of different colors intermixed rather than forming large patches.", "solution": "Position effect variegation arises when a normally euchromatic gene such as $w^+$ is relocated adjacent to pericentromeric heterochromatin by a rearrangement (here, an inversion). The key biological principle is that heterochromatin can stochastically spread into neighboring regions during early eye development, establishing either a silenced (heterochromatic) or active (euchromatic) state in founder cells. Because these decisions are made early, descendant cells inherit the same state, producing clonal patches of tissue that are red when $w^+$ is expressed and white when $w^+$ is silenced.\n\nThe gene Su(var)3-9 encodes a histone H3K9 methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K9 methylation, a defining mark of heterochromatin that recruits HP1 and promotes a stable heterochromatic state. A strong loss-of-function allele of Su(var)3-9 reduces the dosage of H3K9 methyltransferase in a heterozygote (dominant suppressor), thereby lowering H3K9 methylation and diminishing the ability of heterochromatin to form and spread. Consequently, the probability that heterochromatin will spread into the relocated $w^+$ and silence it is substantially reduced. This suppresses variegation, biasing the eye toward $w^+$ expression and red pigment production across most of the tissue.\n\nAt 25 degrees Celsius (a standard rearing temperature), no additional temperature-dependent enhancement or suppression is expected to override the dominant suppression by the Su(var)3-9 loss-of-function allele. Therefore, compared to the classic variegated pattern caused by the inversion alone, the presence of a dominant, strong Su(var)3-9 loss-of-function mutation is predicted to yield an eye that is largely red with minimal or no white patches. This rules out almost entirely white (enhancement), the classic balanced mosaic without modifiers, a unilateral complete switch between eyes, and a fine-grained salt-and-pepper pattern inconsistent with early clonal decisions. The most accurate choice is an eye that is almost entirely red.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1511736"}, {"introduction": "The phenomenon of PEV is not just a genetic curiosity; it is a powerful tool for discovery. By using a variegating phenotype as a sensitive reporter, researchers can hunt for the very genes that control chromatin states. This final practice places you in the role of an experimental designer, asking you to devise a classic genetic screen to identify new recessive *Su(var)* mutations, a foundational technique in the study of epigenetics [@problem_id:1511699].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying Position Effect Variegation (PEV) in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. They have a true-breeding stock of flies in which a chromosomal inversion has placed the wild-type allele for the *white* gene ($w^+$), responsible for red eye pigment, adjacent to a region of heterochromatin. This rearrangement causes the $w^+$ gene to be stochastically silenced in some cells of the developing eye, resulting in a mottled or \"variegated\" red-and-white eye phenotype.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to identify new, previously uncharacterized, autosomal recessive mutations that act as Suppressors of variegation, denoted as *Su(var)*. A *Su(var)* mutation counteracts the silencing effect of the heterochromatin, restoring the wild-type, non-variegated, solid red eye color in flies that also carry the PEV-inducing chromosome.\n\nTo achieve this, the geneticist plans to use the chemical mutagen Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS) to induce random mutations in the fly genome. They have access to both the PEV-inducing stock (variegated eyes) and a standard wild-type laboratory stock (solid red eyes, no PEV-inducing chromosome).\n\nWhich of the following experimental strategies is the most appropriate and effective for screening for new autosomal recessive *Su(var)* mutations?\n\nA. Mutagenize males from the wild-type stock. Cross these mutagenized males to virgin females from the PEV-inducing stock to generate an F1 generation.

Any induced autosomal recessive mutation will be present as heterozygous in F1, so no recessive suppression can be detected at this stage. This scheme only recovers dominant suppressors. Therefore, B does not meet the requirement for autosomal recessive suppressors.\n\nOption D: Mutagenize PEV males, cross to wild-type females, and screen F1. F1 individuals will again be heterozygous for any new autosomal recessive mutation, so recessive effects will not be revealed in F1. Moreover, many F1 will not carry the PEV-inducing chromosome in the appropriate genotype to exhibit variegation, making suppression uninterpretable. Therefore, D is not suitable.\n\nOption C: Mutagenize wild-type males, cross to PEV females to obtain F1, then backcross F1 males to PEV females and screen the next generation. In this backcross, the newly induced autosomal mutation from the F1 male can only contribute a single mutagenized copy; the PEV female parent contributes wild-type autosomes, so progeny will be at best heterozygous for the induced mutation. Without a second mutagenized copy, autosomal recessive mutations will not reach homozygosity. Therefore, C cannot efficiently reveal autosomal recessive suppressors.\n\nOption A: Mutagenize wild-type males, cross to PEV females to obtain F1, then intercross F1 virgin females and males to obtain F2, and screen F2 for fully red, non-variegated eyes. In the F1, induced autosomal mutations are heterozygous, as expected. The intercross allows segregation so that in F2, for any given new autosomal recessive mutation, the expected Mendelian ratios produce $\\frac{1}{4}$ homozygotes for that mutation among siblings that inherit the relevant chromosome. Because the PEV-inducing chromosome is present in the pedigree, an appropriate subset of F2 will also carry PEV; among those, individuals homozygous for a Su(var) allele will exhibit the suppression phenotype (solid red eyes), distinguishing them from their variegated siblings. Thus, A both creates the required homozygosity and maintains PEV for phenotypic scoring, making it the appropriate and effective strategy.\n\nConclusion: Only A implements the necessary intercross to expose autosomal recessive mutations while ensuring the presence of the PEV-inducing chromosome for phenotypic screening.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1511699"}]}
