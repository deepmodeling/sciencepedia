This practice challenges you to apply this core principle by predicting the epigenetic state of two functionally distinct genes within a specialized cell type. By contrasting a constantly active housekeeping gene with a developmentally silenced gene, you will solidify your understanding of how DNA methylation and histone acetylation correlate with gene expression [@problem_id:1485884].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in terminally differentiated adult human hepatocytes (liver cells). The study focuses on the promoter regions of two specific genes:\n\n1.  **Gene PFK**: This gene encodes phosphofructokinase, a critical enzyme in the glycolysis pathway which is essential for the cell's basic energy metabolism.\n2.  **Gene AFP**: This gene encodes alpha-fetoprotein, a protein produced at high levels by fetal liver cells but whose expression is normally silenced in healthy adult liver cells.\n\nThe biologist analyzes the epigenetic state of the promoter regions for both genes, specifically examining the levels of DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands and the acetylation status of the associated histone proteins. Based on the established principles of epigenetic control, which of the following outcomes is the most likely finding of this comparative analysis?\n\nA. The promoter of Gene PFK will have low levels of DNA methylation and high levels of histone acetylation, while the promoter of Gene AFP will have high levels of DNA methylation and low levels of histone acetylation.\n\nB. The promoter of Gene PFK will have high levels of DNA methylation and low levels of histone acetylation, while the promoter of Gene AFP will have low levels of DNA methylation and high levels of histone acetylation.\n\nC. Both the Gene PFK and Gene AFP promoters will have low levels of DNA methylation and high levels of histone acetylation.\n\nD. Both the Gene PFK and Gene AFP promoters will have high levels of DNA methylation and low levels of histone acetylation.\n\nE. The promoter of Gene PFK will have low DNA methylation and the promoter of Gene AFP will have high DNA methylation, but both will exhibit similarly high levels of histone acetylation.", "solution": "In terminally differentiated adult hepatocytes, genes required for core cellular metabolism and normal liver function are actively transcribed, whereas fetal genes like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are epigenetically silenced. Two key and complementary epigenetic marks determine promoter accessibility and transcriptional status: DNA methylation at CpG islands and histone acetylation.\n\nPromoter DNA methylation at CpG islands is typically associated with transcriptional repression because methylated CpGs recruit methyl-CpG-binding proteins and associated corepressors, including histone deacetylases, which compact chromatin and impede transcription factor access. Conversely, hypomethylated promoter CpG islands are permissive for transcription.\n\nHistone acetylation at lysine residues neutralizes positive charges on histone tails, reduces histone-DNA affinity, and promotes an open, euchromatic structure that facilitates transcription initiation and elongation. In contrast, low histone acetylation (i.e., deacetylation) correlates with chromatin compaction and transcriptional silencing.\n\nApplying these principles: Gene PFK encodes phosphofructokinase, a key glycolytic enzyme necessary for basal energy metabolism; in adult hepatocytes this gene is expected to be actively expressed. Therefore, its promoter is most likely to exhibit low levels of DNA methylation and high levels of histone acetylation, consistent with an open chromatin state and active transcription. Gene AFP is a fetal liver gene that is normally silenced in healthy adult liver; therefore, its promoter is most likely to be hypermethylated and associated with low histone acetylation, reflecting a closed chromatin state and transcriptional repression.\n\nEvaluating the options, only option A matches the expected pairing of promoter hypomethylation with high histone acetylation for an actively expressed gene (PFK) and promoter hypermethylation with low histone acetylation for a silenced fetal gene (AFP). The other options either invert these relationships or incorrectly assert similar acetylation states for both genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1485884"}, {"introduction": "The epigenetic landscape is not static; it can be modified, a principle that forms the basis of many modern therapies. This exercise explores how chemical inhibitors can reverse the aberrant gene silencing that often drives diseases like cancer. You will analyze a hypothetical scenario involving a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor to predict its effects on a silenced tumor suppressor gene, thereby connecting molecular mechanisms to changes in cellular behavior [@problem_id:1485937].", "problem": "In a particular line of human colon cancer cells, it is observed that a tumor suppressor gene, designated `APC2`, is transcriptionally silent. The protein product of `APC2` is known to be a critical component of a pathway that arrests the cell cycle in G1 phase, preventing uncontrolled proliferation. Further analysis reveals that the promoter region of the `APC2` gene in these cancer cells is heavily methylated at its CpG islands, whereas in normal, non-cancerous colon cells, this same region is unmethylated and the gene is actively expressed.\n\nThese cancer cells are cultured in a medium containing 5-decitabine, a chemical compound known to be a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), the enzymes that catalyze the addition of methyl groups to DNA. The cells are allowed to grow and divide for several generations in the presence of this inhibitor.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most likely molecular and cellular outcome for these cancer cells?\n\nA. The expression of `APC2` will increase, leading to a higher proportion of cells arresting in the G1 phase.\n\nB. The expression of `APC2` will decrease further because the inhibitor will non-specifically target all gene promoters for silencing.\n\nC. The expression of `APC2` will remain unchanged because the methylation marks are covalently bonded and cannot be removed by an enzyme inhibitor.\n\nD. The 5-decitabine will act as a mutagen, causing a frameshift mutation in the `APC2` gene that results in a permanently non-functional protein.\n\nE. The inhibitor will cause widespread histone acetylation, leading to the overexpression of all genes, including `APC2`, resulting in immediate cell death due to protein toxicity.", "solution": "The premise states that the tumor suppressor gene APC2 is transcriptionally silent in the cancer cells due to heavy CpG methylation at its promoter. Principle: Promoter CpG methylation recruits methyl-CpG binding proteins and associated histone deacetylases, establishing closed chromatin that blocks transcription initiation, thereby silencing the gene. In normal cells, the promoter is unmethylated and the gene is expressed, consistent with an active chromatin state.\n\nThe intervention is culturing cells with a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, specifically a nucleoside analog incorporated during DNA replication, which traps DNMTs (especially DNMT1, the maintenance methyltransferase) on DNA and inhibits maintenance methylation. Principle: With DNMT activity inhibited, hemimethylated CpG sites arising after DNA replication are not remethylated, causing progressive passive demethylation across successive cell divisions.\n\nGiven several generations in the presence of the inhibitor, the CpG islands in the APC2 promoter are expected to lose methyl groups. Principle: Loss of promoter methylation reduces binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins and associated corepressors, favoring a more open chromatin configuration and allowing increased transcriptional initiation. Therefore, APC2 expression increases.\n\nAPC2 is described as a critical component of a pathway that arrests the cell cycle in G1. Principle: Restored tumor suppressor expression that enforces the G1 checkpoint increases the fraction of cells arrested in G1 and reduces uncontrolled proliferation.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Increased APC2 expression with a higher proportion of cells arresting in G1 follows directly from DNMT inhibition leading to promoter demethylation and reactivation of a G1-arrest pathway. This matches the expected epigenetic reactivation outcome.\n- B: Incorrect; DNMT inhibitors do not silence promoters but rather prevent methylation, generally favoring reactivation of hypermethylated tumor suppressors.\n- C: Incorrect; although methylation is a covalent modification, maintenance of methylation patterns requires DNMT activity; inhibition leads to passive demethylation over divisions, changing expression.\n- D: Incorrect; while nucleoside analogs can have genotoxic effects, the most likely and intended mechanism is DNMT inhibition; a specific frameshift in APC2 is not the expected or most likely outcome.\n- E: Incorrect; DNMT inhibitors act on DNA methylation, not by directly causing widespread histone acetylation, and do not cause immediate universal overexpression with protein-toxicity-induced cell death.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular and cellular outcome is increased APC2 expression and increased G1 arrest, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1485937"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond broad-acting drugs, the frontier of epigenetic therapy lies in precision editing. This advanced problem introduces a powerful synthetic biology tool, a dCas9-HDAC fusion protein, which allows for the targeted modification of a single gene's epigenetic state. Your task is to integrate concepts of CRISPR-based targeting and histone modification to predict how this tool can be used to silence a specific oncogene, showcasing the power of programmable gene regulation [@problem_id:1485933].", "problem": "A team of cancer biologists is studying a specific liver cancer cell line, designated `Hep-R`, which is known to exhibit rapid, uncontrolled growth. This phenotype is driven by the significant overexpression of a particular gene, `Oncogene-R`. The researchers aim to develop an epigenetic therapy to suppress the expression of this oncogene.\n\nTo achieve this, they design a synthetic protein complex consisting of two parts. The first part is a nuclease-deficient Cas9 protein (dCas9), which can be directed to a specific DNA sequence by a small guide RNA (gRNA) but cannot cut the DNA. The second part is a Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme, which is known to remove acetyl groups from histone proteins. These two parts are fused together to create a single `dCas9-HDAC` protein.\n\nIn their key experiment, the researchers introduce a vector into the `Hep-R` cells that expresses both the `dCas9-HDAC` fusion protein and a `gRNA` molecule specifically designed to bind to the promoter region of `Oncogene-R`.\n\nBased on the established molecular functions of these components, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary molecular and cellular consequences of this experiment?\n\nA. `Oncogene-R` transcription will decrease due to methylation of the DNA at its promoter, leading to a slower rate of cell proliferation.\n\nB. `Oncogene-R` will be permanently inactivated through double-strand breaks introduced by the dCas9-HDAC complex at the promoter, leading to cell death (apoptosis).\n\nC. Transcription of `Oncogene-R` will be enhanced because the large dCas9-HDAC complex helps recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter, leading to an even faster rate of cell proliferation.\n\nD. Histones at the `Oncogene-R` promoter will become hypoacetylated, leading to chromatin compaction, reduced transcription of the oncogene, and a decreased rate of cell proliferation.\n\nE. The dCas9-HDAC complex will bind to the promoter but will have no significant effect on `Oncogene-R` expression or cell proliferation, as dCas9 is catalytically inactive and cannot alter the DNA sequence.", "solution": "We proceed by identifying the molecular functions of each engineered component and deducing the consequences of their combined, targeted action at the promoter of the oncogene.\n\n1. dCas9 function and targeting:\n- A nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) lacks endonuclease activity and therefore cannot introduce double-strand breaks. It retains DNA-binding specificity via base pairing between the small guide RNA (gRNA) and the genomic sequence adjacent to a PAM. Thus, introducing a vector encoding dCas9 and a gRNA targeting the promoter of Oncogene-R will localize the dCas9 fusion protein to that promoter without cutting DNA.\n\n2. HDAC catalytic activity:\n- Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone tails. This can be represented schematically as:\n$$\n\\text{Lys-Ac} \\longrightarrow \\text{Lys}^{+} + \\text{acetate}^{-},\n$$\nwhere deacetylation restores the positive charge on the lysine $\\epsilon$-amino group.\n\n3. Biophysical consequence of deacetylation:\n- Acetylation of lysine neutralizes its positive charge, weakening electrostatic attraction between histone tails and the negatively charged DNA backbone. Deacetylation restores positive charge on histones, strengthening histone-DNA interactions, promoting chromatin compaction (heterochromatin-like state), reducing nucleosome mobility, and decreasing accessibility for transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.\n\n4. Localized epigenetic repression via dCas9-HDAC:\n- Fusing HDAC to dCas9 and targeting it with a gRNA to the Oncogene-R promoter localizes deacetylase activity specifically to that promoter. The expected primary molecular effect is hypoacetylation of histones at that locus, leading to chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression of Oncogene-R.\n\n5. Cellular phenotype:\n- Oncogene-R overexpression drives rapid proliferation in the Hep-R cell line. Reducing its transcription is expected to lower oncogenic signaling and decrease the rate of cell proliferation. This does not require DNA cleavage and does not necessarily induce apoptosis; rather, it produces a reversible, epigenetic suppression.\n\n6. Evaluation of answer choices:\n- A: Incorrect. The mechanism described involves histone deacetylation, not DNA methylation. While DNA methylation can repress transcription, HDAC does not catalyze cytosine methylation.\n- B: Incorrect. dCas9 cannot introduce double-strand breaks, and HDAC does not cleave DNA. No permanent inactivation by cutting occurs.\n- C: Incorrect. HDAC activity is associated with repression, not activation, and the dCas9-HDAC complex is not intended to recruit RNA polymerase II.\n- D: Correct. Targeted HDAC activity will yield histone hypoacetylation at the promoter, chromatin compaction, reduced transcription of Oncogene-R, and consequently a decreased proliferation rate.\n- E: Incorrect. Although dCas9 is catalytically inactive for DNA cleavage, the HDAC moiety is catalytically active and will alter chromatin to repress transcription when localized to the promoter.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that histones at the Oncogene-R promoter become hypoacetylated, causing chromatin compaction, decreased transcription, and reduced proliferation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1485933"}]}
