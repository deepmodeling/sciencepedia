While this technique separates molecules primarily by size, it's crucial to understand that a molecule's three-dimensional shape, or conformation, also plays a significant role.

The plasmid is a circular, double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecule with a total size of 5,000 base pairs (bp). Using this preparation, the student creates three distinct samples to be analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, a technique that separates molecules in a porous gel matrix under an electric field primarily based on their size and conformation.\n\n*   **Sample 1:** Contains the plasmid in its native, **supercoiled** form, which is a tightly wound and compact structure.\n*   **Sample 2:** Contains the plasmid after it has been completely digested with a restriction enzyme that cuts at only one specific site, converting all the circular plasmids into a **linearized** form.\n*   **Sample 3:** Contains the plasmid after treatment with a nicking agent that introduces a single-strand break in the DNA backbone of each plasmid, causing it to unwind into a relaxed, **nicked-circular** form.\n\nAll three forms of the plasmid have the same molecular weight since they all consist of 5,000 bp. Based on the physical principles of gel electrophoresis, what is the expected order of migration of these three forms through the agarose gel, from fastest-migrating (traveling the furthest distance from the origin) to slowest-migrating (traveling the shortest distance)?\n\nA.

All three forms will migrate the same distance because they have the same molecular weight.", "solution": "Electrophoretic separation in agarose gel is governed by electrophoretic mobility. Define the mobility $\\mu$ and velocity $v$ under electric field $E$ by\n$$\n\\mu=\\frac{v}{E},\\qquad \\mu=\\frac{q}{f},\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the effective charge and $f$ is the frictional coefficient that depends on molecular conformation and hydrodynamic radius in the porous gel matrix. For DNA, the charge density per base pair is approximately uniform; therefore for plasmid forms with the same length $L$ (here $L=5000$ base pairs), the effective charge $q$ is the same across all three samples. Consequently, differences in mobility arise from differences in $f$ due to conformation.\n\nLet $f_{\\text{sc}}$, $f_{\\text{lin}}$, and $f_{\\text{nc}}$ denote the frictional coefficients of supercoiled, linearized, and nicked-circular (relaxed open-circle) forms, respectively. The supercoiled form is the most compact, having the smallest hydrodynamic radius, which minimizes steric interactions with the gel pores; thus\n$$\nf_{\\text{sc}}<f_{\\text{lin}}<f_{\\text{nc}}.\n$$\nUsing $\\mu=q/f$ with a common $q$, the mobilities obey\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{sc}}>\\mu_{\\text{lin}}>\\mu_{\\text{nc}}.\n$$\nThe migration distance after a fixed electrophoresis time $t$ is\n$$\nd=\\mu E t=\\frac{q}{f}Et,\n$$\nso the ordering of $d$ mirrors that of $\\mu$.

The positions of these sites are mapped relative to the *EcoRI* site, which is designated as the 0 kb reference point. The *BamHI* site is located at the 1.5 kb mark, and the *HindIII* site is at the 4.0 kb mark.\n\nA sample of the pGEN101 plasmid is subjected to a double digestion, meaning it is incubated with both *EcoRI* and *BamHI* enzymes simultaneously until the reaction goes to completion.
