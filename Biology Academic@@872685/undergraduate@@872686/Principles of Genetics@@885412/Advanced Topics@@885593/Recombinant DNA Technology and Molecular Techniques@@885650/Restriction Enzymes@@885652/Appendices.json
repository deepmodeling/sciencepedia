By definition of isoschizomers, their recognition sequence is identical, while their cleavage pattern may differ. *Sma*I cleaves to produce blunt ends at 5'-CCC|GGG-3'. *Xma*I cleaves to produce 5' cohesive ends; as given, the cut is 5'-C|CCGGG-3' and yields a 4-nucleotide 5' overhang that corresponds to the top-strand sequence CCGG.\n\nA blunt-ended *Sma*I insert cannot directly ligate to an *Xma*I-generated sticky end because DNA ligase requires either cohesive base-pairing to juxtapose the 3'-OH and 5'-phosphate termini or a flush blunt-blunt interface; a sticky-blunt junction without processing lacks base pairing and thus is not a substrate for ligation. Therefore, to achieve ligation, the *Xma*I 5' overhangs must be made blunt, which can be done in two standard ways consistent with the protocol’s allowance for auxiliary enzymes:\n- Fill-in synthesis: a DNA polymerase with 5' to 3' polymerase activity extends the recessed 3' ends using the 5' overhang as a template, converting the 4-nucleotide 5' overhang (CCGG) into a flush blunt end by adding the complementary 4 bases (GGCC) to the recessed strand.\n- Chew-back: an enzyme with single-strand nuclease or 3' to 5' exonuclease activity removes the 5' overhang, again yielding a blunt end.\n\nAfter either end-polishing method, the vector ends are blunt and can be ligated to the blunt *Sma*I insert using DNA ligase. However, in both cases the sequence at the junction is altered such that the original uninterrupted 5'-CCCGGG-3' recognition site is not reconstituted across the ligation boundary:\n- With fill-in, four nucleotides complementary to the 5' overhang are newly synthesized at the vector end, so the ligation junction splits and extends the original site; the palindromic hexamer is no longer present as a continuous unit across the junction.\n- With chew-back, part of the recognition sequence is removed from the vector end, so the palindromic site is truncated and cannot be present at the junction.\n\nBecause both *Sma*I and *Xma*I require the intact, continuous 5'-CCCGGG-3' sequence on both strands to bind and cleave, and because the ligation junction is a hybrid that lacks this uninterrupted site, neither enzyme can cleave at the newly formed junctions. Therefore, ligation is possible after end polishing, but the hybrid sites are not cut by *Sma*I or *Xma*I.\n\nThe correct choice is that ligation is possible, but the resulting hybrid sites can be cut by neither enzyme.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1518001"}]}
