{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Success in molecular cloning begins with high-quality starting materials. Before you can use a plasmid as a vector, you must verify its integrity. This practice challenges you to interpret a common but sometimes confusing result in gel electrophoresis, where a pure sample of plasmid DNA appears as multiple bands. Understanding why this happens is a fundamental skill for any molecular biologist, as it relates to the different physical shapes, or topologies, a circular DNA molecule can adopt and how those shapes affect its movement through a gel matrix [@problem_id:1467741].", "problem": "A molecular biology student isolates a single type of circular plasmid from a bacterial culture. The plasmid is known to have a size of 5,000 base pairs. To verify the integrity and concentration of the purified plasmid DNA, the student runs a sample on an agarose gel containing an intercalating dye and observes the DNA under ultraviolet light. Instead of a single band, three distinct bands appear. Band 1 is the most intense and has migrated the furthest down the gel. Band 2 has an intermediate intensity and has migrated an intermediate distance. Band 3 is the faintest band and has migrated the shortest distance from the loading well.\n\nAssuming the purification was successful and there is no contamination from other plasmids or genomic DNA, which of the following statements provides the most accurate identification of the molecular forms corresponding to the three observed bands?\n\nA. Band 1 is the linear form, Band 2 is the supercoiled form, and Band 3 is the nicked circular form.\n\nB. Band 1 represents single-stranded plasmid DNA, Band 2 represents the double-stranded linear form, and Band 3 represents the double-stranded supercoiled form.\n\nC. Band 1 is the supercoiled form, Band 2 is the linear form, and Band 3 is the nicked circular form.\n\nD. The bands represent different quantities of the same plasmid: Band 1 is 1 µg, Band 2 is 2 µg, and Band 3 is 3 µg.\n\nE. The sample consists of plasmid monomers, dimers, and trimers, corresponding to Band 1, Band 2, and Band 3, respectively.", "solution": "Agarose gel electrophoresis separates DNA molecules primarily by their mobility under an electric field. For DNA molecules of the same length in base pairs, differences in mobility arise from conformation rather than size, because their mass and overall charge scale similarly with length. For a single plasmid length, the relevant topological forms are covalently closed circular supercoiled (ccc), linear double-stranded, and nicked open circular (oc). Their mobilities differ because their effective compactness and hydrodynamic drag in the gel matrix differ.\n\nThe general ordering of mobility for identical-length plasmid DNA is determined by compactness:\n$$\nd(\\text{supercoiled}) > d(\\text{linear}) > d(\\text{nicked open circular}),\n$$\nwhere $d(\\cdot)$ denotes the migration distance from the well. Supercoiled DNA is the most compact and experiences the least frictional resistance, so it migrates the furthest. Nicked open circular DNA is the least compact (largest effective radius), so it migrates the shortest distance. Linear DNA is intermediate.\n\nRegarding band intensities, typical plasmid preparations contain predominantly covalently closed supercoiled DNA, a smaller fraction of nicked open circular due to single-strand nicks introduced during handling, and a smaller fraction of linear DNA due to double-strand breaks. Thus, the most intense band tends to be the supercoiled form, with linear and nicked forms less abundant, producing fainter bands. The presence of an intercalating dye (e.g., ethidium bromide) can modestly alter absolute mobilities but does not change the standard ordering under typical gel conditions.\n\nApplying these principles to the observations:\n- Band 1 is the most intense and migrated the furthest; by the mobility rule, this is the supercoiled form.\n- Band 2 migrated an intermediate distance; this corresponds to the linear form.\n- Band 3 is faintest and migrated the least; this is the nicked open circular form.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\n- A is incorrect because linear DNA does not migrate furthest; supercoiled does.\n- B is incorrect because plasmid preparations do not yield single-stranded plasmid DNA as a distinct band under these conditions, and the stated order is inconsistent with mobility rules.\n- C matches the correct assignments based on mobility and typical relative abundance.\n- D is incorrect because the bands differ by conformation, not by fixed quantities; intensity reflects amount, but distance reflects conformation.\n- E is incorrect in this context because monomer, dimer, and trimer forms would differ in size (e.g., 5 kb, 10 kb, 15 kb) and would not produce the described mobility pattern for a single predominant plasmid topology; the observed three-band pattern for a single-size plasmid under standard conditions corresponds to the three topological forms.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification is: Band 1 is supercoiled, Band 2 is linear, and Band 3 is nicked circular.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1467741"}, {"introduction": "Once you have a reliable plasmid vector, the next step is to design the cloning strategy itself. It is not enough to simply get your gene of interest into the plasmid; for functional studies, it must be inserted in the correct orientation relative to regulatory elements like promoters. This exercise asks you to think like an experimental designer, evaluating different methods to achieve directional cloning and ensure your gene is expressed correctly [@problem_id:1467769].", "problem": "A molecular biologist aims to express a specific gene, which we will call `gene_X`, in a bacterial system. For the gene to be transcribed and translated correctly, it must be inserted into a plasmid vector in a specific 5' to 3' orientation relative to a promoter sequence that is already part of the plasmid. The plasmid's multiple cloning site (MCS) is a short segment of DNA which contains many restriction sites, providing flexibility for inserting foreign DNA. The biologist has access to a variety of restriction enzymes.\n\nTo maximize the proportion of recombinant plasmids where `gene_X` is inserted in the correct orientation, which of the following cloning strategies is the most effective and direct?\n\nA. Digesting both the plasmid and the source DNA containing `gene_X` with a single restriction enzyme that creates complementary \"sticky\" ends, followed by mixing the fragments with DNA ligase.\n\nB. Digesting the plasmid with a restriction enzyme that produces blunt ends, and separately amplifying `gene_X` using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with primers that also create blunt ends, followed by blunt-end ligation.\n\nC. Digesting both the plasmid and the source DNA containing `gene_X` with a single restriction enzyme, and then treating the digested plasmid with alkaline phosphatase to remove 5' phosphate groups before the ligation step.\n\nD. Using two different restriction enzymes, Enzyme 1 and Enzyme 2, to digest both the plasmid and the source DNA. The recognition sites for these enzymes flank the `gene_X` sequence and are also present sequentially within the plasmid's MCS.\n\nE. Digesting the plasmid with Enzyme 1 and digesting the source DNA containing `gene_X` with Enzyme 2, where Enzyme 1 and Enzyme 2 produce non-complementary sticky ends.", "solution": "Goal: maximize the proportion of recombinant plasmids in which the insert is in the correct 5' to 3' orientation relative to the promoter. Let $N_{\\text{recombinant}}$ be the number of plasmids that contain an insert and $N_{\\text{correct}}$ the number in correct orientation. The desired proportion is $q=\\frac{N_{\\text{correct}}}{N_{\\text{recombinant}}}$. The key physical principle is that the compatibility and polarity of DNA ends generated by restriction enzymes determine how many ligation products are possible and whether orientation is constrained.\n\nAnalyze each strategy:\n\nA. Single restriction enzyme producing compatible sticky ends on both vector and insert yields identical ends on both sides. The insert can ligate in either of two orientations with equal likelihood. Among recombinants, $q=\\frac{1}{2}$ because both orientations are possible and equally probable.\n\nB. Blunt-end ligation yields no overhangs, so there is no orientation bias. Any insert that ligates can do so in either orientation with equal probability. Thus $q=\\frac{1}{2}$, and overall ligation efficiency is typically lower than with sticky ends, but the orientation proportion among recombinants remains $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nC. Dephosphorylating the vector after a single-enzyme digest prevents vector self-ligation by removing 5' phosphates, thereby reducing background of empty vector. The insert provides 5' phosphates (if not dephosphorylated), allowing ligation to the vector. However, the ends are still identical on both sides, so orientation remains unconstrained. Therefore $q=\\frac{1}{2}$, even though the fraction of recombinants among transformants may increase.\n\nD. Two different restriction enzymes flanking the insert and present sequentially in the MCS generate nonidentical, mutually specific ends on each side of both vector and insert. Because the two ends are distinct and only one vector end is compatible with one insert end, ligation can occur in only one orientation. This is directional cloning. In the absence of complications such as star activity or partial digests, $q\\approx 1$.\n\nE. Digesting vector with Enzyme 1 and insert with Enzyme 2 that produce non-complementary sticky ends yields ends that cannot anneal, so ligation does not proceed without adapters. Thus $N_{\\text{recombinant}}=0$ under stated conditions and the strategy fails to produce recombinants; effectively $q$ is undefined, but practically zero useful clones.\n\nComparing the strategies, only using two different restriction enzymes with compatible, nonidentical ends (directional cloning) maximizes $q$ to be as close to $1$ as possible. Therefore, the most effective and direct strategy to maximize the proportion of correctly oriented recombinants is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1467769"}, {"introduction": "In the real world of scientific research, experiments do not always go as planned. Troubleshooting unexpected outcomes is a critical skill that deepens your understanding of the underlying principles. This scenario presents a classic cloning experiment with a missing key ingredient, DNA ligase, yet still produces a result.

Digest the pClone-V1 plasmid with a single restriction enzyme, `Enz-I`, to linearize it at a specific cloning site.\n2.  Prepare the gene of interest (the insert) with ends compatible with the `Enz-I` digestion site.\n3.

A concatemer formed by multiple copies of the insert DNA ligated together.", "solution": "We analyze each procedural step and the biochemical requirements for successful cloning and antibiotic selection, then deduce which DNA species can yield ampicillin-resistant colonies in the absence of added ligase.\n\n1) Requirement for covalent closure in ligation:\n- A single restriction enzyme cut in a circular plasmid produces a linear molecule with complementary cohesive ends (if the enzyme makes sticky ends) or blunt ends (if blunt-cutter). In either case, covalent re-joining of the sugar-phosphate backbone requires DNA ligase to form phosphodiester bonds.\n- Without added ligase in the ligation mix, any vector-insert joining or vector self-closure cannot form covalent bonds in vitro. At most, cohesive ends can transiently anneal by base pairing, but the backbones remain nicked or broken.\n\n2) Transformation and DNA form dependence:\n- High-efficiency transformation and stable maintenance in bacteria require covalently closed circular plasmid DNA. Linear DNA is rapidly degraded by the RecBCD pathway and does not replicate from a plasmid origin.\n- Nicked circular plasmids (covalently closed on one strand but with a single-strand nick) can transform with reduced efficiency; however, purely annealed ends without ligation leave double-strand scission points repaired only by hydrogen bonding at sticky ends, not by covalent closure, and are thus highly unstable prior to cell entry.\n- Therefore, linearized plasmid from step 1, without ligase-mediated closure, will not efficiently yield transformants.\n\n3) Antibiotic selection constraint:\n- Growth on ampicillin requires an intact, replicating plasmid carrying the ampicillin-resistance gene. DNA that lacks an origin of replication and the resistance cassette cannot confer resistance.\n\n4) Sources of ampicillin-resistant colonies when ligase is omitted:\n- The most common and likely source is contaminating, undigested, supercoiled parental plasmid that escaped restriction digestion. Even highly efficient digests often leave a small fraction of uncut plasmid. This species transforms with high efficiency and confers ampicillin resistance, yielding colonies.\n- Re-circularization of the linearized vector without insert would normally require ligase. Although sticky ends can anneal, the absence of covalent closure makes entry and survival unlikely, and in vivo repair is inefficient relative to transformation by intact, uncut plasmid.\n- Recombinant plasmids (vector plus insert) require ligase to covalently join insert and vector, so they are not expected.\n- Linearized plasmid cannot replicate and will be degraded; it will not confer resistance.\n- Insert concatemers lack the plasmid origin and resistance gene and cannot confer resistance.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A: Requires ligase; not expected.\n- B: Requires ligase for covalent closure; annealed but unligated circles are unlikely to yield colonies compared to carryover uncut plasmid; thus not the most likely recovered species.\n- C: Linear DNA cannot confer resistance; not expected.\n- D: The original, uncut pClone-V1 plasmid is the most likely source of colonies due to incomplete digestion or carryover, and will be the DNA isolated from survivors.\n- E: Lacks origin and resistance; cannot yield colonies.\n\nTherefore, the plasmid DNA most likely isolated from the surviving colonies is the original, uncut pClone-V1 plasmid (option D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1467751"}]}
