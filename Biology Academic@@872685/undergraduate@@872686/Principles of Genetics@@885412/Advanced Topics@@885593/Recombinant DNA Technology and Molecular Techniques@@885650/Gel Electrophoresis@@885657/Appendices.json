The `pVec` plasmid is a circular piece of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) with a total length of 4000 base pairs (bp). The student inserts the `geneX` DNA fragment, which is 1500 bp long, into a unique `SmaI` restriction enzyme site on `pVec`. This insertion process successfully creates a larger, recombinant circular plasmid but disrupts the `SmaI` site, rendering it non-functional.\n\nTo verify the cloning experiment, the student needs to determine the orientation of the `geneX` insert within the `pVec` backbone. A restriction map of the original `pVec` plasmid shows a single `XhoI` restriction site located 500 bp away from the `SmaI` insertion site. Separately, the sequence of the `geneX` insert reveals it contains a single `PstI` restriction site, which is asymmetrically positioned 300 bp from one end of the gene (let's call this End A) and 1200 bp from the other end (End B).\n\nThe insertion can result in two possible orientations:\n1.  **Forward Orientation**: End A of `geneX` is ligated to the side of the cut `SmaI` site that is closer to the `XhoI` site.\n2.  **Reverse Orientation**: End B of `geneX` is ligated to the side of the cut `SmaI` site that is closer to the `XhoI` site.\n\nThe student performs a double-digest on the recombinant plasmid using the restriction enzymes `XhoI` and `PstI`.

We must first determine the total size of the plasmid and then calculate the positions of the cut sites for each orientation.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total size of the recombinant plasmid.**\nThe original plasmid vector, `pVec`, is 4000 bp. A gene insert, `geneX`, of 1500 bp is added. The total size, $L_{\\text{total}}$, of the resulting circular recombinant plasmid is the sum of the sizes of the vector and the insert.\n$$L_{\\text{total}} = L_{\\text{vec}} + L_{\\text{gene}} = 4000 \\text{ bp} + 1500 \\text{ bp} = 5500 \\text{ bp}$$\nA double-digest with two enzymes on a circular plasmid will produce two fragments, and their sizes must sum to the total size of the plasmid.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the distance between the two restriction sites, `XhoI` and `PstI`.**\nThe two fragments generated are defined by the two paths along the circular plasmid between the `XhoI` and `PstI` cut sites. Let's find the length of the shorter path between the `XhoI` and `PstI` sites for each orientation. The length of the other fragment will be the total plasmid size minus the length of this shorter path.\n\nThe `XhoI` site is in the plasmid backbone, and the `PstI` site is in the `geneX` insert. The reference points are the `SmaI` insertion site and the `XhoI` site, which are 500 bp apart on the original vector.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Forward Orientation.**\nIn the Forward orientation, End A of `geneX` is ligated to the side of the `SmaI` cut that is closer to the `XhoI` site. The `PstI` site is 300 bp from End A.\n\nTo find the size of one fragment, we can calculate the distance between the `XhoI` and `PstI` sites along the shorter path. This path consists of the segment from `XhoI` to the insertion point in the backbone, and the segment from the insertion point to the `PstI` site in the insert.\n- Distance from `XhoI` to the nearest `SmaI` junction: 500 bp.\n- Distance from this junction (End A) to the `PstI` site: 300 bp.\n\nThe size of the first fragment, $F_{1,\\text{fwd}}$, is the sum of these two distances.\n$$F_{1,\\text{fwd}} = 500 \\text{ bp} + 300 \\text{ bp} = 800 \\text{ bp}$$\nThe second fragment, $F_{2,\\text{fwd}}$, is the remaining part of the circular plasmid.\n$$F_{2,\\text{fwd}} = L_{\\text{total}} - F_{1,\\text{fwd}} = 5500 \\text{ bp} - 800 \\text{ bp} = 4700 \\text{ bp}$$\nSo, for the Forward orientation, the expected fragments are {800 bp, 4700 bp}.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Reverse Orientation.**\nIn the Reverse orientation, End B of `geneX` is ligated to the side of the `SmaI` cut that is closer to the `XhoI` site. The `PstI` site is 1200 bp from End B.\n\nWe calculate the size of the first fragment in the same way.\n- Distance from `XhoI` to the nearest `SmaI` junction: 500 bp.\n- Distance from this junction (End B) to the `PstI` site: 1200 bp.\n\nThe size of the first fragment, $F_{1,\\text{rev}}$, is the sum of these distances.\n$$F_{1,\\text{rev}} = 500 \\text{ bp} + 1200 \\text{ bp} = 1700 \\text{ bp}$$\nThe second fragment, $F_{2,\\text{rev}}$, is the rest of the plasmid.\n$$F_{2,\\text{rev}} = L_{\\text{total}} - F_{1,\\text{rev}} = 5500 \\text{ bp} - 1700 \\text{ bp} = 3800 \\text{ bp}$$\nSo, for the Reverse orientation, the expected fragments are {1700 bp, 3800 bp}.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the results with the given options.**\n- Forward orientation yields fragments of 800 bp and 4700 bp.\n- Reverse orientation yields fragments of 1700 bp and 3800 bp.\n\nThis matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1489811"}, {"introduction": "Real-world lab experiments don't always proceed to perfect completion, and interpreting the resulting data is a critical skill for any scientist.
