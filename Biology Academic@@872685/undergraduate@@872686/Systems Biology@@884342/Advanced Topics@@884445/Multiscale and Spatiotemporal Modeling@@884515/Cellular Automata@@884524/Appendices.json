For the simplest one-dimensional, or elementary, automata, a standardized system is used to classify every possible behavior. This exercise introduces the elegant Wolfram classification scheme, which maps each local rule to a unique integer, allowing for precise and unambiguous communication [@problem_id:1666358]. Mastering this fundamental concept is the first step toward exploring the vast \"universe\" of possible automata and understanding their diverse behaviors from a common starting point.", "problem": "A one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton consists of a line of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: active (1) or inactive (0). The state of each cell at a time step $t+1$ is determined by a fixed rule based on the states of itself and its immediate left and right neighbors at time step $t$. The group of these three cells is called the neighborhood.\n\nThere are $2^3=8$ possible configurations for a neighborhood. The behavior of an elementary cellular automaton is completely specified by an 8-bit binary string, where each bit corresponds to the output state (0 or 1) for one of the 8 neighborhood configurations. By convention, these configurations are ordered from `111`, `110`, `101`, down to `000`. The corresponding 8-bit output string is then interpreted as a binary number to yield the automaton's Wolfram rule number, an integer from 0 to 255.\n\nConsider a specific elementary cellular automaton designed to detect local singularity. The rule for this automaton is as follows: a cell becomes active in the next time step if and only if exactly one cell in its 3-cell neighborhood (left, center, right) was active in the current time step.\n\nDetermine the Wolfram rule number that corresponds to this behavior.", "solution": "An elementary cellular automaton with neighborhood $(l,c,r)$ updates according to the rule: the next state is $1$ if and only if exactly one of $l,c,r$ is $1$. Equivalently, letting $s=l+c+r$, the output is $1$ if $s=1$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nEnumerating the neighborhoods in the prescribed order $111,110,101,100,011,010,001,000$, their sums $s$ are $3,2,2,1,2,1,1,0$, respectively. Therefore the outputs are $0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0$.
