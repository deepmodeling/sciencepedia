Consider a simplified one-dimensional model of a developing tissue, represented as a semi-infinite line of cells extending from $x = 0$ to $x \\to \\infty$. A source at the boundary $x=0$ synthesizes a specific morphogen, maintaining a constant concentration $C_0$ at that point. As the morphogen molecules spread into the tissue, they diffuse with a diffusion coefficient $D$. Simultaneously, the morphogen is actively degraded by enzymes present uniformly throughout the tissue. This degradation process is assumed to follow first-order kinetics, meaning the rate of degradation at any point is proportional to the local morphogen concentration $C(x)$, with a rate constant $k$.\n\nAfter a sufficient amount of time, the system reaches a steady state, where the concentration profile of the morphogen, $C(x)$, no longer changes with time. A key property of this morphogen gradient is its characteristic length scale, which determines the effective range of the signal. We define this length scale as the distance from the source at which the morphogen concentration drops to $1/e$ of its value at the source, where $e$ is Euler's number.\n\nDetermine the analytical expression for this characteristic length scale in terms of the given parameters $D$ and $k$.", "solution": "Let $C(x,t)$ denote the morphogen concentration.
