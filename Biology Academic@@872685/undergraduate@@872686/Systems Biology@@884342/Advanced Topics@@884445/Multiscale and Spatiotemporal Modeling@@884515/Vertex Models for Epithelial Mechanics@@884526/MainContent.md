## Introduction
Epithelial tissues are fundamental building blocks of multicellular organisms, forming cohesive sheets that line organs, provide protective barriers, and undergo complex transformations during development. The emergence of intricate structures like folded tubes and patterned tissues from the collective action of individual cells is a central question in [developmental biology](@entry_id:141862) and biophysics. How can we quantitatively connect the forces generated by molecules within a single cell to the large-scale mechanics and [morphology](@entry_id:273085) of an entire tissue? The [vertex model](@entry_id:265799) provides a powerful computational answer to this question, offering a framework to simulate and understand the mechanical principles governing epithelial architecture.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of [vertex models](@entry_id:756482) for [epithelial mechanics](@entry_id:269022), designed to bridge the gap between abstract physical concepts and concrete biological phenomena. We will deconstruct the model from its first principles to its advanced applications. In "Principles and Mechanisms," you will learn how a complex three-dimensional tissue is simplified into a two-dimensional polygonal network and how its behavior is dictated by a biophysically-grounded energy function. We will explore how forces derived from this energy drive tissue evolution, including cell rearrangements and phase transitions. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate the model's versatility in simulating critical biological processes such as cell division, apoptosis, [tissue folding](@entry_id:265995), and [wound healing](@entry_id:181195), and show how it integrates with molecular [signaling pathways](@entry_id:275545). Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will challenge you to apply these concepts to solve concrete problems, solidifying your understanding of how [vertex models](@entry_id:756482) translate theory into practice.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The behavior of [epithelial tissues](@entry_id:261324), characterized by collective [cell migration](@entry_id:140200), [tissue folding](@entry_id:265995), and responses to mechanical stress, emerges from the complex interplay of forces generated within and between individual cells. Vertex models provide a powerful computational framework to dissect these mechanics by simplifying the complex three-dimensional cellular architecture into a more tractable two-dimensional representation. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and mechanisms that underpin [vertex models](@entry_id:756482), from the biophysical basis of their energy functions to the dynamic rules that govern tissue evolution.

### From Three-Dimensional Cell to Two-Dimensional Polygon

An [epithelial tissue](@entry_id:141519) is a contiguous sheet of cells, where each cell is a three-dimensional object, often with a columnar or cuboidal shape. A crucial step in formulating a 2D [vertex model](@entry_id:265799) is to project this 3D structure onto a 2D plane. This is achieved through a primary simplifying assumption known as the **prismatic assumption**. This assumption posits that the cross-sectional shape and [mechanical properties](@entry_id:201145) of a cell are constant along its apical-basal axis (the axis perpendicular to the tissue sheet). Consequently, a 3D cell can be conceptualized as a prism. The 2D [vertex model](@entry_id:265799) then represents the apical surface of the tissue as a **polygonal tessellation**—a space-filling arrangement of polygons with no gaps or overlaps [@problem_id:1477477].

In this framework:
-   Each **polygon** represents a single cell as viewed from its apical surface.
-   The **edges** of the polygons represent the [cell-cell junctions](@entry_id:171803) where adjacent cell membranes are physically linked.
-   The **vertices** are the points where three or more [cell junctions](@entry_id:146782) meet.

This geometric simplification allows the complex mechanics of 3D cell volume and surface area to be mapped onto their 2D counterparts: polygon area and perimeter. The dynamics of the entire tissue can then be simulated by tracking the movement of the vertices, which in turn reshapes the cells and their connections.

### The Energy Function: A Biophysical Description of Cell Shape

The shape of each cell and the overall configuration of the tissue are assumed to be governed by a tendency to minimize a total potential energy, $U$. This energy function is an abstraction of the underlying biophysical processes. The total energy is the sum of the energies of all $N$ individual cells in the tissue:
$$U = \sum_{i=1}^{N} E_i$$
A common and effective form for the energy of a single cell, $E_i$, captures the two most significant mechanical contributions to its shape: resistance to changes in size and contractility at its boundaries.

$$E_i = \frac{K}{2}(A_i - A_0)^2 + \sum_{j \in \text{edges of } i} \Lambda_j l_j$$

Here, $A_i$ is the current area of the polygon representing cell $i$, and $A_0$ is its preferred or **target area**. The sum is over all edges of cell $i$, where $l_j$ is the length of edge $j$ and $\Lambda_j$ is its associated **[line tension](@entry_id:271657)**. If the line tension is assumed to be uniform for all junctions of a cell, the second term simplifies to $\Lambda_i P_i$, where $P_i$ is the cell's perimeter. Let's examine the biophysical meaning of each term.

#### The Area Elasticity Term

The first term, $\frac{K}{2}(A_i - A_0)^2$, represents an elastic penalty for the cell's area deviating from its target area, $A_0$. The parameter $K$ is the **[area elasticity](@entry_id:268511) modulus**. This term is not merely an abstract mathematical construct; it is a 2D proxy for fundamental 3D cell properties. The cytoplasm is largely composed of water and is effectively incompressible on the timescales of [cell shape change](@entry_id:187217). Under the prismatic assumption, the cell's volume $V_i$ is proportional to its apical area $A_i$ (specifically, $V_i = A_i h_i$, where $h_i$ is the cell height). Therefore, maintaining a constant volume while changing apical area requires a change in cell height. The [area elasticity](@entry_id:268511) term thus represents the energetic cost of both cytoplasmic incompressibility and the associated deformations of the cell along the apical-basal axis [@problem_id:1477534].

By analogy with three-dimensional thermodynamics, where pressure is defined as $p = -\frac{dE}{dV}$, we can define an **effective 2D pressure**, $\Pi$, for the cell:

$$\Pi_i = -\frac{\partial E_i}{\partial A_i} = -K(A_i - A_0)$$

This equation provides a clear mechanical interpretation: if the cell's area $A_i$ is smaller than its target area $A_0$, the pressure $\Pi_i$ is positive, driving the cell to expand. Conversely, if $A_i$ is larger than $A_0$, the pressure is negative (a suction), driving the cell to contract [@problem_id:1477528]. For instance, a cell with an [area elasticity](@entry_id:268511) modulus of $K = 5.00 \, \text{pN/nm}^3$, a target area of $A_0 = 950 \, \text{nm}^2$, and a current area of $A = 925 \, \text{nm}^2$ would have an internal pressure of $\Pi = -5.00 \, (925 - 950) = 125 \, \text{pN/nm}$. This pressure acts outwardly on the cell's boundary.

#### The Line Tension Term

The second term, often expressed as $\Lambda P_i$, represents the energy associated with the cell's perimeter. The parameter $\Lambda$ is the **line tension**, which has units of force (e.g., J/m or Newtons). This term reflects the combined effects of two opposing molecular-scale forces acting at [cell-cell junctions](@entry_id:171803):
1.  **Cortical Actomyosin Contractility**: A network of [actin filaments](@entry_id:147803) and [myosin motors](@entry_id:182494) underlying the cell membrane generates contractile tension, which acts to shorten the cell perimeter. This is an active, energy-consuming process that tends to increase $\Lambda$.
2.  **Cell-Cell Adhesion**: Cadherin-based adhesion complexes physically link adjacent cells. Adhesion counteracts cortical tension by holding cells together, effectively lowering the energetic cost of a junction and thus reducing the value of $\Lambda$.

Therefore, the line tension parameter $\Lambda$ represents the net effect of contractility pulling junctions inward and adhesion holding them together. A positive $\Lambda$ indicates that contractility dominates, favoring configurations with shorter perimeters [@problem_id:1477534].

#### Model Parameters and their Physical Units

To ensure physical consistency, it is essential to understand the units of the model parameters. The energy function must be dimensionally homogeneous. Assuming energy $E$ is in Joules (J) and length is in meters (m), area $A$ is in $\text{m}^2$ and perimeter $P$ is in $\text{m}$.
For the area term, $[K] \cdot [A^2] = [K] \cdot (\text{m}^2)^2 = \text{J}$, which implies that the units of the [area elasticity](@entry_id:268511) modulus $K$ are $\text{J}/\text{m}^4$. For the [line tension](@entry_id:271657) term, $[\Lambda] \cdot [P] = [\Lambda] \cdot \text{m} = \text{J}$, which implies that the units of line tension $\Lambda$ are $\text{J}/\text{m}$, which is equivalent to units of force (Newtons, N) [@problem_id:1477522].

To illustrate how these terms combine, consider a single cell modeled as a regular hexagon with side length $s$. Its perimeter is $P = 6s$ and its area is $A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2$. The energy of this cell, as a function of its size $s$, is:
$$E(s) = \frac{K}{2} \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2 - A_0 \right)^2 + \Lambda (6s)$$
This expression demonstrates how the cell's energy, and thus its preferred state, is a balance between achieving a target area and minimizing its perimeter, all dictated by its geometry [@problem_id:1477488].

### Forces and Dynamics: How the Tissue Evolves

The energy function provides a static description of the tissue's mechanical state. To understand how the tissue moves and reorganizes, we must translate this energy landscape into forces that drive the motion of the vertices.

#### Forces from the Energy Potential

The force on any component of a mechanical system is the negative gradient of the potential energy with respect to that component's coordinates. In a [vertex model](@entry_id:265799), the fundamental dynamic degrees of freedom are the positions of the vertices. The force $\vec{F}_v$ on a given vertex at position $\vec{r}_v$ is therefore:

$$\vec{F}_v = -\nabla_{\vec{r}_v} U = -\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_v}, \frac{\partial U}{\partial y_v} \right)$$

This force arises from all the energy terms that depend on the vertex's position. Moving a vertex changes the lengths and orientations of the edges connected to it, which in turn alters the areas and perimeters of the adjacent cells.

A related and intuitive concept is the tension force acting along a single cell-cell junction (an edge). This force can be defined as the negative partial derivative of the total energy with respect to the length of that edge, $l_j$: $T_j = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial l_j}$. A positive tension $T_j$ implies that the edge is being pulled taut and an external force would be required to lengthen it. This concept is explored in [@problem_id:1477517], which demonstrates that the tension along an edge is a sum of contributions from the pressures of the two adjacent cells and the intrinsic line tensions of their perimeters.

#### Vertex Equilibrium and Mechanical Stability

A vertex is in a state of **[mechanical equilibrium](@entry_id:148830)** when the net force acting upon it is zero ($\vec{F}_v = 0$). For a typical vertex where three edges meet, this condition means that the vector sum of the tension forces from the three adjoining edges must be zero. This is a 2D analogue of the Young-Laplace law, dictating the angles at which [cell junctions](@entry_id:146782) meet based on the balance of their respective tensions.

An equilibrium can be stable or unstable. A [stable equilibrium](@entry_id:269479) corresponds to a [local minimum](@entry_id:143537) in the energy landscape. If a vertex is slightly displaced from a [stable equilibrium](@entry_id:269479), it will experience a restoring force that pushes it back. The "stiffness" of this restoring force is determined by the curvature of the energy landscape, which is given by the second derivatives of the potential energy. For a displacement along the x-axis, this stiffness can be quantified by an [effective spring constant](@entry_id:171743) $k_{xx} = \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2}$, evaluated at the [equilibrium position](@entry_id:272392). A positive value for this constant indicates that the equilibrium is stable with respect to perturbations in that direction [@problem_id:1477523].

#### Simulating Motion: Overdamped Dynamics

The cellular environment is characterized by high viscosity and low mass, a regime where inertial effects are negligible (low Reynolds number). Consequently, the motion of a vertex is **overdamped**: its velocity is directly proportional to the [net force](@entry_id:163825) acting on it, rather than its acceleration. The equation of motion for a vertex is:

$$\vec{v}_v = \frac{1}{\gamma} \vec{F}_v$$

where $\gamma$ is an effective friction coefficient that encapsulates the drag from the surrounding medium and cell-cell contacts.

To simulate the tissue's evolution over time, this equation is integrated numerically. A common method is the **Forward Euler scheme**. If at time $t$ a vertex is at position $\vec{r}(t)$ and experiences a force $\vec{F}(t)$, its new position after a small time step $\Delta t$ is approximated as:

$$\vec{r}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{r}(t) + \vec{v}(t) \Delta t = \vec{r}(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{\gamma} \vec{F}(t)$$

By repeatedly calculating the forces on all vertices and updating their positions, the simulation dynamically minimizes the total energy of the tissue, allowing for the study of complex morphogenetic processes [@problem_id:1477508].

### Tissue Plasticity and Phase Transitions

Vertex models are particularly adept at capturing the plastic nature of [epithelial tissues](@entry_id:261324), including their ability to rearrange and exhibit fluid-like or solid-like behaviors. These large-scale phenomena emerge from local rules governing cell interactions.

#### Topological Transitions: The T1 Process

For a tissue to deform significantly, cells must be able to change their neighbors. The primary mechanism for cell rearrangement in a confluent monolayer is a **T1 topological transition**. This is a local event involving four cells. It proceeds in two steps:
1.  An existing edge shared between two cells (say, cell A and cell B) progressively shrinks.
2.  When the edge length reaches zero, the two vertices at its ends merge. This four-fold vertex is unstable and immediately resolves by the formation of a new edge, perpendicular to the original one. This new edge now separates the other two cells that were part of the motif (say, cell C and cell D).

The net result is a neighbor-swapping event: cells A and B, which were neighbors, lose contact, while cells C and D, which were not direct neighbors, come into contact [@problem_id:1477486]. The frequency of these T1 transitions determines the tissue's ability to flow and remodel.

#### The Jamming-Unjamming Transition

Epithelial tissues can exhibit properties of both solids and fluids. In a "jammed" solid-like state, cells are locked in place by their neighbors and the tissue resists shear. In an "unjammed" fluid-like state, cells can readily rearrange via T1 transitions, allowing the tissue to flow like a viscous liquid.

The transition between these states can be elegantly captured by a variation of the [vertex model](@entry_id:265799), sometimes called the **Shape Parameter Vertex Model (SPV)**. This model explicitly introduces a **target perimeter**, $P_0$, into the energy function:

$$E_i = K_A (A_i - A_0)^2 + K_P (P_i - P_0)^2$$

Here, the cell has a preferred perimeter $P_0$ in addition to its preferred area $A_0$. The balance between these two geometric preferences is captured by the dimensionless **target [shape index](@entry_id:186249)**, defined as $p_0 = \frac{P_0}{\sqrt{A_0}}$. This index compares the cell's target perimeter to the minimum possible perimeter for its target area (that of a circle). A cell with a low $p_0$ prefers to be compact and rounded, while a cell with a high $p_0$ prefers a more elongated or convoluted shape.

Remarkably, this single parameter, $p_0$, can control the macroscopic mechanical state of the tissue.
-   When $p_0$ is below a critical value ($p_0  p_0^*$), the energetic drive to minimize perimeter is strong. Cells adopt elongated, space-filling shapes like hexagons, which pack tightly and resist rearrangement. The tissue is in a jammed, solid-like state.
-   When $p_0$ is above this critical value ($p_0 > p_0^*$), the energetic penalty for having a larger perimeter is reduced. This lowers the energy barrier for the [cell shape](@entry_id:263285) changes required for a T1 transition, allowing cells to rearrange. The tissue becomes unjammed and behaves like a fluid.

The critical value $p_0^*$ can be estimated by considering when the energy of a solid-like hexagonal tiling becomes equal to the energy of a configuration that facilitates rearrangement, such as a square tiling. Following this logic, one can calculate that the transition occurs at a critical [shape index](@entry_id:186249) of approximately $p_0^* = 2 + \sqrt{2\sqrt{3}} \approx 3.861$ [@problem_id:1477530]. This powerful result connects a microscopic, cell-level parameter ($p_0$) directly to a macroscopic tissue property—its phase of matter.
