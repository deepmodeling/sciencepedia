These networks model proteins (products of genes) as nodes and their physical interactions as edges. When a protein is already known to be associated with a disease, proteins that are \"close\" to it in the network become strong candidates for further investigation.\n\nA search for new candidates can be modeled as a random walk on the network. Consider a small, simplified PPI network where the connections between proteins have been assigned a confidence score, representing the strength of evidence for that interaction. In a weighted random walk, the probability of moving from a starting protein to a connected neighbor in a single step is proportional to the confidence score of the edge linking them.\n\nSuppose Protein Alpha ($P\\alpha$), the product of a known disease-associated gene, is connected to three other proteins: Protein Beta ($P\\beta$), Protein Gamma ($P\\gamma$), and Protein Delta ($P\\delta$). The confidence scores for these interactions are as follows:\n- The interaction between $P\\alpha$ and $P\\beta$ has a score of 5.\n- The interaction between $P\\alpha$ and $P\\gamma$ has a score of 12.\n- The interaction between $P\\alpha$ and $P\\delta$ has a score of 8.\n\n$P\\alpha$ has no other direct connections in the network.\n\nIf a random walk begins at $P\\alpha$, what are the probabilities that the walker will move to $P\\beta$, $P\\gamma$, and $P\\delta$, respectively, in a single step? Present your answer as a single row matrix containing the three probabilities in the order corresponding to $P\\beta$, $P\\gamma$, and $P\\delta$. Express each probability as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "In a weighted random walk on a network, the probability of moving from a node to a particular neighbor in one step equals the weight of the edge to that neighbor divided by the sum of the weights of all edges emanating from the current node.\n\nLet the weights of the edges from Protein Alpha to its neighbors be denoted by:\n- to Protein Beta: $w_{\\alpha\\beta} = 5$,\n- to Protein Gamma: $w_{\\alpha\\gamma} = 12$,\n- to Protein Delta: $w_{\\alpha\\delta} = 8$.\n\nCompute the total outgoing weight from Protein Alpha:\n$$\nS = w_{\\alpha\\beta} + w_{\\alpha\\gamma} + w_{\\alpha\\delta} = 5 + 12 + 8 = 25.\n$$\nTherefore, the one-step transition probabilities from Protein Alpha are:\n$$\np_{\\beta} = \\frac{w_{\\alpha\\beta}}{S} = \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{1}{5}, \\quad\np_{\\gamma} = \\frac{w_{\\alpha\\gamma}}{S} = \\frac{12}{25}, \\quad\np_{\\delta} = \\frac{w_{\\alpha\\delta}}{S} = \\frac{8}{25}.\n$$\nArranged as a row matrix in the order (Protein Beta, Protein Gamma, Protein Delta), the probabilities are:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{5}  \\frac{12}{25}  \\frac{8}{25}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{5}  \\frac{12}{25}  \\frac{8}{25}\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1453456"}, {"introduction": "While network proximity provides a strong starting point, it often generates candidates that are not biologically relevant to the specific disease context.

This problem [@problem_id:1453511] illustrates how to use tissue-specific expression data to prioritize candidates for a liver disorder, demonstrating a critical step in moving from a raw network analysis to a biologically plausible hypothesis.", "problem": "In systems biology, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are often used to identify potential disease-causing genes. The principle of \"guilt by association\" suggests that genes interacting with known disease genes are themselves likely candidates. However, this must be considered alongside other biological information.\n\nConsider a simplified PPI network consisting of five genes: ALDOB, GBE1, PYGM, AANAT, and TPH1. The observed interactions between the proteins they encode are as follows:\n- ALDOB interacts with GBE1\n- ALDOB interacts with PYGM\n- ALDOB interacts with AANAT\n- GBE1 interacts with PYGM\n\nResearchers are studying a rare inherited metabolic disorder that specifically affects the liver. Genetic screening has already identified that mutations in the `PYGM` gene are a known cause of this liver-specific condition. To find other potential gene candidates, researchers consult tissue-specific gene expression data:\n- `ALDOB`: Ubiquitously expressed at high levels in all major tissues.\n- `GBE1`: Highly expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle.\n- `PYGM`: Highly expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle.\n- `AANAT`: Highly expressed almost exclusively in the brain.\n- `TPH1`: Interacts with `AANAT` and is also highly expressed almost exclusively in the brain.\n\nBased on the network structure and the provided expression data, which of the following genes is the most promising candidate for further investigation as a potential cause of this specific liver disorder?\n\nA. ALDOB\n\nB. GBE1\n\nC. AANAT\n\nD. TPH1", "solution": "First, apply the guilt-by-association principle in a protein-protein interaction network: candidate genes most likely to be involved in the same disease tend to be those that directly interact with a known disease gene. Here, the known disease gene is PYGM, implicated in a rare liver-specific metabolic disorder. From the provided interactions, the genes that directly interact with PYGM are ALDOB and GBE1. AANAT does not directly interact with PYGM; it interacts with ALDOB. TPH1 interacts with AANAT and is not adjacent to PYGM.\n\nSecond, integrate tissue-specific expression as a necessary biological filter because the disorder is liver-specific. Genes whose expression is high in the liver are more plausible causal candidates than those expressed predominantly in unrelated tissues. The expression data are: ALDOB is ubiquitously high across tissues; GBE1 is highly expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle; PYGM is highly expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle; AANAT is brain-specific; TPH1 is brain-specific.\n\nThird, formalize the prioritization logic to combine network proximity and tissue relevance. Define for each gene $g$ the indicators $N(g)$ for direct network proximity and $T(g)$ for tissue match:\n- $N(g)=1$ if $g$ directly interacts with PYGM, and $N(g)=0$ otherwise.\n- $T(g)=1$ if $g$ is highly expressed in the liver (the affected tissue), and $T(g)=0$ otherwise.\nAdditionally, incorporate a qualitative tissue specificity term $S(g)$ that is higher for genes whose high expression pattern is concentrated in relevant tissues (e.g., liver and skeletal muscle) and lower for genes that are ubiquitously expressed or predominantly expressed in unrelated tissues.\n\nEvaluate each candidate:\n- ALDOB: $N(\\text{ALDOB})=1$ because it directly interacts with PYGM. $T(\\text{ALDOB})=1$ because it is highly expressed in the liver, but $S(\\text{ALDOB})$ is relatively lower due to ubiquitous high expression, which reduces specificity to the liver pathology.\n- GBE1: $N(\\text{GBE1})=1$ because it directly interacts with PYGM. $T(\\text{GBE1})=1$ due to high liver expression, and $S(\\text{GBE1})$ is higher than that of ALDOB because its expression pattern (liver and skeletal muscle) matches PYGM and is less ubiquitous, aligning with metabolic tissue context.\n- AANAT: $N(\\text{AANAT})=0$ (no direct interaction with PYGM), $T(\\text{AANAT})=0$ (brain-specific), so deprioritized.\n- TPH1: $N(\\text{TPH1})=0$ (no direct interaction with PYGM), $T(\\text{TPH1})=0$ (brain-specific), so deprioritized.\n\nFinally, among the direct interactors, GBE1 is preferred over ALDOB because it both shares the tissue-expression context of PYGM (liver and skeletal muscle) and is not ubiquitously expressed, increasing its specificity as a candidate for a liver-specific metabolic disorder.
