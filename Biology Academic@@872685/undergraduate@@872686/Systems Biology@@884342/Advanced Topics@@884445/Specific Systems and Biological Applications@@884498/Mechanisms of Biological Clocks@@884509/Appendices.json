This practice explores this connection within the context of circadian rhythms, using a simplified mathematical model to predict how the removal of a key clock gene impacts the period of the internal clock. By working through this hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:1444805], you will gain a quantitative understanding of how repressor proteins contribute to the timing of the negative feedback loop that drives circadian oscillations.", "problem": "The circadian rhythm, an approximately 24-hour internal clock, is governed in mammals by a complex network of genes and proteins creating a transcription-translation feedback loop. A simplified model of this oscillator can be used to predict the effects of genetic mutations.\n\nIn this model, the period of the clock, $T$, is determined by the sum of two characteristic times: a synthesis phase time, $\\tau_{syn}$, and a repression phase time, $\\tau_{rep}$. The relationship is given by $T = C (\\tau_{syn} + \\tau_{rep})$, where $C$ is a dimensionless constant of the system.\n\nIn a normal, wild-type (WT) mouse, the free-running period in constant darkness is measured to be $T_{WT} = 23.7$ hours. For these WT mice, biochemical analysis reveals that the characteristic time of the repression phase is 1.5 times longer than the synthesis phase, i.e., $\\tau_{rep, WT} = 1.5 \\cdot \\tau_{syn}$.\n\nNow, consider a genetically engineered mouse with a homozygous knockout (KO) of the *Cry1* gene. One of the primary functions of the Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) protein is to stabilize the main repressor proteins of the clock. In the absence of CRY1, these repressor proteins are significantly less stable. This instability exclusively affects the repression phase of the clock. It is determined that the characteristic time of the repression phase in the KO mouse is reduced to 60.0% of its value in the WT mouse. Assume that the synthesis phase time, $\\tau_{syn}$, and the system constant, $C$, are unaffected by this genetic modification.\n\nCalculate the new free-running period, $T_{KO}$, for the *Cry1* KO mouse.

We are given the relationship for the period $T$ as a function of a synthesis time $\\tau_{syn}$ and a repression time $\\tau_{rep}$:\n$$T = C (\\tau_{syn} + \\tau_{rep})$$\nwhere $C$ is a system constant.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the wild-type (WT) mouse to determine the relationship between the known parameters.\nWe are given:\n- The period of the WT mouse, $T_{WT} = 23.7$ hours.\n- The relationship between the repression and synthesis times for the WT mouse: $\\tau_{rep, WT} = 1.5 \\cdot \\tau_{syn}$.\n\nWe can substitute these into the model equation for the WT case:\n$$T_{WT} = C (\\tau_{syn} + \\tau_{rep, WT})$$\n$$23.7 = C (\\tau_{syn} + 1.5 \\cdot \\tau_{syn})$$\n$$23.7 = C (2.5 \\cdot \\tau_{syn})$$\n\nThis equation relates the known period to the unknown model parameters $C$ and $\\tau_{syn}$. We can find the value of the composite term $C \\cdot \\tau_{syn}$, which will be useful later:\n$$C \\cdot \\tau_{syn} = \\frac{23.7}{2.5} = 9.48 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the knockout (KO) mouse. The problem states that $\\tau_{syn}$ and $C$ are unchanged. The only parameter that changes is the repression time, $\\tau_{rep}$. The new repression time, $\\tau_{rep, KO}$, is 60.0% of the wild-type repression time:\n$$\\tau_{rep, KO} = 0.600 \\cdot \\tau_{rep, WT}$$\n\nWe can express $\\tau_{rep, KO}$ in terms of $\\tau_{syn}$ by using the WT relationship $\\tau_{rep, WT} = 1.5 \\cdot \\tau_{syn}$:\n$$\\tau_{rep, KO} = 0.600 \\cdot (1.5 \\cdot \\tau_{syn})$$\n$$\\tau_{rep, KO} = 0.900 \\cdot \\tau_{syn}$$\n\nNow we can write the equation for the period of the KO mouse, $T_{KO}$:\n$$T_{KO} = C (\\tau_{syn} + \\tau_{rep, KO})$$\n\nSubstitute the expression we found for $\\tau_{rep, KO}$:\n$$T_{KO} = C (\\tau_{syn} + 0.900 \\cdot \\tau_{syn})$$\n$$T_{KO} = C (1.900 \\cdot \\tau_{syn})$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to use the composite term $C \\cdot \\tau_{syn}$ that we calculated from the WT data:\n$$T_{KO} = 1.900 \\cdot (C \\cdot \\tau_{syn})$$\n\nNow, substitute the value $C \\cdot \\tau_{syn} = 9.48$ hours:\n$$T_{KO} = 1.900 \\cdot 9.48 \\text{ hours}$$\n$$T_{KO} = 18.012 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$T_{KO} \\approx 18.0 \\text{ hours}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18.0}$$", "id": "1444805"}, {"introduction": "The period of a biological clock is not set by genes alone; it is finely tuned by a host of post-translational modifications that regulate the stability and activity of clock proteins.

By reasoning through the effect of a drug that inhibits $CK1$ [@problem_id:1444782], you will see how slowing down protein degradation can directly lead to a lengthening of the circadian period, illustrating a key mechanism for period control.", "problem": "In a typical mammalian cell, the core circadian clock is governed by a transcription-translation feedback loop. A protein complex, formed by CLOCK and Brain and Muscle Arnt-Like 1 (BMAL1), acts as a transcription factor that promotes the expression of the Period (PER) and Cryptochrome (CRY) genes. After being synthesized, the PER and CRY proteins form a complex, travel back into the nucleus, and inhibit the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex. This action represses their own transcription, forming a negative feedback loop. The period of the rhythm is largely determined by the time it takes for the inhibitory PER/CRY complex to be cleared from the nucleus, allowing a new cycle of transcription to begin.\n\nA key step in this process is the regulated degradation of the PER protein. An enzyme called Casein Kinase 1 ($CK1$) phosphorylates the PER protein. This phosphorylation serves as a molecular tag, marking the PER protein for subsequent degradation by the proteasome system.\n\nA research team is studying this system in a synchronized culture of fibroblast cells. They introduce a novel, highly specific drug that acts as a potent inhibitor of $CK1$'s kinase activity.

Regulated degradation of PER depends on $CK1$-mediated phosphorylation.\n\nLet $P_{n}$ be nuclear PER, $P_{n}^{*}$ its phosphorylated form, with rate constants $k_{p}$ (phosphorylation by $CK1$), $k_{dp}$ (dephosphorylation), and $k_{deg}$ (degradation of $P_{n}^{*}$).

This final practice connects the intrinsic properties of the clock to the real-world experience of jet lag. By modeling the process of re-synchronization after traveling across time zones [@problem_id:1444803], you will uncover why the fact that our natural clock period is slightly longer than 24 hours makes it easier to adapt to westward travel than to eastward travel.", "problem": "The human circadian clock, our internal timekeeping system, has a natural, or endogenous, period that is typically slightly longer than 24 hours. This internal clock is synchronized (entrained) to the 24-hour solar day primarily by environmental light cues. When we travel rapidly across multiple time zones, a mismatch occurs between our internal clock and the new local time, leading to a condition known as jet lag. The process of re-synchronization involves the internal clock shifting to align with the new light-dark cycle.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this re-synchronization process. An individual has an endogenous circadian period of $\\tau$. Under the influence of a typical environmental light-dark cycle, the maximum phase delay the clock can achieve in a single day is $H_{delay}$ hours, and the maximum phase advance it can achieve is $H_{adv}$ hours. Assume that $H_{delay} > H_{adv}$ and that the endogenous period $\\tau$ is greater than the standard day length of $T_0 = 24$ hours. We also assume that $H_{adv} > \\tau - T_0$, ensuring that re-synchronization is always possible.\n\nAfter a long flight crossing $N$ time zones, the individual adjusts their light exposure schedule to achieve the maximum possible corrective shift each day until they are fully re-synchronized. Let $D_{west}$ be the number of days required to fully adapt after a westward flight (which requires a phase delay) and $D_{east}$ be the number of days to adapt after an eastward flight (which requires a phase advance) across the same number of time zones.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the ratio $\\frac{D_{east}}{D_{west}}$ in terms of $\\tau$, $T_0$, $H_{delay}$, and $H_{adv}$.", "solution": "Let the initial phase mismatch in hours after crossing $N$ time zones be $E_{0}=N$.

Since the endogenous drift $\\Delta$ is also a delay, it assists the light-induced delay. Therefore, the net daily phase correction toward reducing a westward (delay) mismatch is\n$$\n\\text{net delay per day} = H_{delay} + \\Delta = H_{delay} + (\\tau - T_{0}).\n$$\nHence, the days required to correct a westward mismatch of $N$ hours is\n$$\nD_{west} = \\frac{N}{H_{delay} + (\\tau - T_{0})}.\n$$\n\nUnder a schedule that yields the maximum phase advance per day, the light-induced advance is $H_{adv}$ hours per day.
