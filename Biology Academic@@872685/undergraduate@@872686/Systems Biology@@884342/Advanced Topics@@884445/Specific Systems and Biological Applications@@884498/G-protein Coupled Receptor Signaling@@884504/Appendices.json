This binding event triggers a cascade that leads to the production of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), a crucial second messenger. The process unfolds in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Receptor Activation:** Under saturating hormone conditions, we assume all GPCRs on the cell surface become activated. Let an activated receptor be denoted by $R^*$.\n2.  **G-protein Activation:** An activated receptor, $R^*$, can catalytically activate G-proteins. This means a single $R^*$ can activate multiple G-proteins sequentially without being consumed in the process. An activated G-protein is denoted by $G^*$.\n3.  **Effector Activation:** An activated G-protein, $G^*$, binds to an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, $A$, to form a 1-to-1 active complex, $[G^*A^*]$.

The mechanism involves the following simplified model:\n\n1.  A constant total concentration of a specific G-protein, $[G]_{total}$, is available in the cell membrane.\n2.  Upon sustained receptor stimulation, the inactive G-protein is converted to an active, dissociated form. This process is modeled with a pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_{act}$.
