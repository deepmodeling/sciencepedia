By analyzing the kinetics of this release, you will calculate the activation time required to pass the point of no return, linking intracellular transport to the temporal control of cell fate.", "problem": "A simplified model for the commitment to apoptosis (programmed cell death) considers the interaction between Smac/DIABLO and Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). Initially, Smac/DIABLO is sequestered within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). Upon receiving a pro-apoptotic signal, Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP) occurs, allowing Smac/DIABLO to be released into the cytosol, where it binds to and inactivates IAPs.\n\nConsider a cell at time $t=0$, when MOMP is initiated. Let the total initial amount of Smac/DIABLO in the IMS be $S_0$, and the total initial amount of IAP in the cytosol be $I_0$. The transport of Smac/DIABLO from the IMS to the cytosol is modeled as a first-order process. The amount of Smac/DIABLO remaining in the IMS, denoted $S_m(t)$, decreases over time according to the rate law $\\frac{dS_m}{dt} = -k S_m(t)$, where $k$ is the transport rate constant.\n\nUpon entering the cytosol, each molecule of Smac/DIABLO is assumed to instantaneously and irreversibly bind to one molecule of free IAP, effectively sequestering it. The cell is considered to have passed the point-of-no-return and committed to apoptosis once a critical fraction, $f$, of the initial IAP pool has been sequestered. To ensure this is possible, the system satisfies the condition $S_0 > f I_0$.\n\nBased on this model, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the activation time, $T_{act}$, defined as the time required for the cumulative amount of Smac/DIABLO transported into the cytosol to become equal to the amount needed to sequester the target fraction $f$ of the initial IAP amount. Your expression should be in terms of $S_0$, $I_0$, $k$, and $f$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the time $T_{act}$ required to sequester a fraction $f$ of the initial IAP amount, $I_0$. According to the model's assumption of instantaneous and irreversible 1:1 binding, this occurs when the cumulative amount of Smac/DIABLO transported into the cytosol equals $f I_0$.\n\nFirst, we determine the amount of Smac/DIABLO remaining in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), $S_m(t)$, as a function of time. The governing differential equation is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{dS_m}{dt} = -k S_m(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dS_m}{S_m} = -k dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The integration on the left is from the initial amount $S_m(0) = S_0$ to the amount at time $t$, $S_m(t)$. The integration on the right is from time $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{S_0}^{S_m(t)} \\frac{1}{S'_m} dS'_m = \\int_0^t -k dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n\\ln(S_m(t)) - \\ln(S_0) = -kt\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write this as:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_m(t)}{S_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for $S_m(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{S_m(t)}{S_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\nS_m(t) = S_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis expression gives the amount of Smac/DIABLO still inside the mitochondria at any time $t$.\n\nNext, we find the cumulative amount of Smac/DIABLO that has been transported into the cytosol, let's call it $S_c(t)$. By conservation, this is the initial amount $S_0$ minus the amount remaining in the IMS, $S_m(t)$:\n$$\nS_c(t) = S_0 - S_m(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_m(t)$ we just found:\n$$\nS_c(t) = S_0 - S_0 \\exp(-kt) = S_0 (1 - \\exp(-kt))\n$$\nThis equation describes the buildup of Smac/DIABLO in the cytosol over time.\n\nThe activation time $T_{act}$ is defined as the time at which the amount of Smac/DIABLO in the cytosol is equal to the amount required to sequester a fraction $f$ of the initial IAPs, which is $f I_0$.

Furthermore, since $f I_0 > 0$, we have $S_0 > S_0 - f I_0$, so the ratio $\\frac{S_0}{S_0 - f I_0}$ is greater than 1, making its logarithm positive, which gives a physically meaningful positive time $T_{act}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{S_0 - f I_0}\\right)}$$", "id": "1416823"}]}
