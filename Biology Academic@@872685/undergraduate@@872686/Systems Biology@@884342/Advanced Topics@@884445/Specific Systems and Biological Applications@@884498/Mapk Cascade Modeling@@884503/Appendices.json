The system's behavior is described by the following set of processes, all governed by mass-action kinetics:\n\n1.  **Activation**: The inactive form $M$ is converted to the active form $M_p$ through phosphorylation by an upstream kinase. This upstream kinase is assumed to provide a constant activating signal, represented by its concentration, $S$. The activation reaction is $M \\rightarrow M_p$, with a rate directly proportional to both the concentration of $M$ and the signal $S$. The bimolecular rate constant for this process is $k_a$.\n\n2.  **Deactivation**: The active form $M_p$ is dephosphorylated back to the inactive form $M$ by a phosphatase enzyme. The concentration of this phosphatase is assumed to be constant at a value of $P$.
