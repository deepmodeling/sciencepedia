The binding of a ligand (L) to a receptor (R) is a reversible process described by the equilibrium $L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$. The strength of this interaction is quantified by the dissociation constant, $K_D$.\n\nExperimental measurements in a simplified buffer system have determined the following dissociation constants for the two compounds with the target receptor:\n- The dissociation constant for Compound A is $K_{D,A} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-8}$ M.\n- The dissociation constant for Compound B is $K_{D,B} = 2.8 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nAssuming simple one-to-one binding kinetics for both compounds, calculate the ratio of the concentration of Compound B to the concentration of Compound A that is required to achieve exactly 50% occupancy of the target receptors.
