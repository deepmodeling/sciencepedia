To truly grasp how this molecular circuit controls movement, it is essential to understand the specific function of each component.

The cell's movement is driven by rotating flagella. The default state of the flagellar motor is counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation, which results in the flagella forming a bundle that propels the cell forward in a smooth \"run.\"\n\nThe switch to a \"tumble\" is induced by a change in the motor's rotation to clockwise (CW), which causes the flagellar bundle to fly apart and the cell to reorient randomly. This switch is biochemically controlled. A sensory kinase, CheA, when active, autophosphorylates and subsequently transfers its phosphoryl group to a response regulator protein, CheY. This phosphorylated form, CheY-P, is the key signaling molecule. CheY-P binds to the switch complex of the flagellar motor, inducing the transition from CCW to CW rotation, thereby causing a tumble. In the absence of CheY-P binding, the motor spins CCW, resulting in a run.\n\nConsider two distinct mutant strains of *E. coli*.\n- **Mutant 1**: Has a null mutation in the gene encoding CheA (`cheA`). This strain, denoted $\\Delta$CheA, produces no functional CheA protein.\n- **Mutant 2**: Has a null mutation in the gene encoding CheY (`cheY`).

The biochemical generation of CheY-P requires the kinase CheA, which autophosphorylates and transfers the phosphoryl group to CheY, yielding CheY-P.\n\nFormally, the implications for motor state are:\n- If CheY-P is present and bound to the motor, then the motor rotates CW, leading to a tumble.\n- If CheY-P is absent, the motor defaults to CCW, leading to a run.\n\nFor the mutant strains:\n1) In the $\\Delta$CheA mutant, there is no functional CheA. Without CheA, there is no autophosphorylation of CheA and thus no phosphotransfer to CheY. Therefore, the production rate of CheY-P is effectively zero, resulting in no CheY-P at the motor. By the motor logic above, absence of CheY-P yields continuous CCW rotation and hence only runs.\n\n2) In the $\\Delta$CheY mutant, there is no functional CheY. Without CheY, there is no substrate to receive phosphate from CheA, so CheY-P cannot be produced regardless of CheA activity. Consequently, CheY-P is absent at the motor, and the motor remains in the default CCW state, producing only runs.\n\nTherefore, both $\\Delta$CheA and $\\Delta$CheY mutants exhibit run-only behavior.

Building on our understanding of how the tumble signal is generated via CheA and CheY, this problem explores the crucial role of signal termination. By considering a scenario where the phosphatase CheZ is absent, you will investigate how the system behaves without its primary \"off switch,\" revealing the importance of dynamic balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in controlling cell behavior [@problem_id:1423164].", "problem": "The swimming behavior of the bacterium *Escherichia coli* is governed by a sophisticated signal transduction pathway that allows it to navigate chemical gradients, a process known as chemotaxis. The bacterium alternates between two primary modes of movement: a smooth, straight-line \"run\" and a random, reorienting \"tumble\".\n\nThis behavior is controlled by the direction of rotation of its flagellar motors. In a simplified model of the core pathway:\n1.  A kinase protein, CheA, associated with chemoreceptors, can autophosphorylate. The rate of this phosphorylation changes in response to environmental chemical signals, but there is a baseline rate of activity even in a neutral environment.\n2.  The phosphorylated CheA (CheA-P) then transfers its phosphate group to a response regulator protein, CheY.\n3.  The phosphorylated form of this regulator, CheY-P, diffuses through the cytoplasm and binds to the flagellar motor. This binding event induces a \"tumble\".\n4.  When CheY-P is not bound to the motor, the motor defaults to a state that produces a \"run\".\n5.  A phosphatase protein, CheZ, is responsible for rapidly dephosphorylating CheY-P, converting it back to CheY. This terminates the tumble signal and allows the cell to resume running.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that has a gene deletion rendering the CheZ protein completely absent and non-functional. If a single bacterium of this mutant strain is placed in a chemically uniform medium (i.e., no attractants or repellents), what will be its resulting long-term swimming behavior?\n\nA.

The cell will be non-motile.\n\nE. The cell will alternate between running and tumbling, but with a significantly lower frequency of tumbles than a normal cell.", "solution": "We map the qualitative pathway to a simple kinetic balance for the phosphorylated response regulator that controls motor state.\n\n1) In a chemically uniform medium, CheA has a baseline autophosphorylation rate and generates $A_{p}$ (CheA-P). CheA-P phosphorylates CheY to CheY-P. Let $Y_{p}$ denote the concentration of CheY-P and $Y_{T}$ the total CheY. The production term for $Y_{p}$ is proportional to $A_{p}$ and the available unphosphorylated CheY, $(Y_{T}-Y_{p})$, with rate constant $k_{A}$.\n\n2) CheY-P is removed by dephosphorylation. There are two routes: a rapid catalytic route via CheZ (rate constant $k_{Z}$, proportional to CheZ abundance $Z$) and a slow intrinsic hydrolysis route with rate constant $k_{h}$. Thus the removal term is $(k_{Z} Z + k_{h}) Y_{p}$.\n\n3) The resulting dynamical equation is\n$$\n\\frac{dY_{p}}{dt} = k_{A} A_{p} \\left(Y_{T}-Y_{p}\\right) - \\left(k_{Z} Z + k_{h}\\right) Y_{p}.\n$$\n\n4) In the CheZ deletion mutant, $Z=0$, so the equation reduces to\n$$\n\\frac{dY_{p}}{dt} = k_{A} A_{p} \\left(Y_{T}-Y_{p}\\right) - k_{h} Y_{p}.\n$$\nAt steady state, set $\\frac{dY_{p}}{dt}=0$ and solve for $Y_{p}^{*}$:\n$$\n\\begin{align*} 0 &= k_{A} A_{p} \\left(Y_{T}-Y_{p}^{*}\\right) - k_{h} Y_{p}^{*} \\\\ &\\Longrightarrow k_{A} A_{p} Y_{T} = \\left(k_{A} A_{p} + k_{h}\\right) Y_{p}^{*} \\\\ &\\Longrightarrow Y_{p}^{*} = \\frac{k_{A} A_{p}}{k_{A} A_{p} + k_{h}}\\,Y_{T}. \\end{align*}\n$$\n\n5) By the problem statement, CheZ is the phosphatase responsible for rapidly dephosphorylating CheY-P; thus $k_{h}$ is relatively slow compared to the CheA-driven phosphorylation term present at baseline ($A_p > 0$). Consequently, in the absence of CheZ, the steady-state fraction of CheY that is phosphorylated, $Y_{p}^{*}/Y_{T} = \\frac{k_{A} A_{p}}{k_{A} A_{p} + k_{h}}$, is large and approaches $1$ when $k_{A} A_{p} \\gg k_{h}$.\n\n6) Motor control: CheY-P binding to the flagellar motor biases rotation into the tumble-inducing state. If we denote the motor occupancy (tumble bias) by a standard binding form $B = \\frac{Y_{p}}{K_{d}+Y_{p}}$, then for elevated $Y_{p}^{*}$ with $Y_{p}^{*} \\gg K_{d}$, one has $B \\approx 1$, meaning the motor is almost always in the tumble-inducing state. Since the default run occurs only when CheY-P is not bound, sustained high $Y_{p}^{*}$ drives persistent tumbling.\n\n7) Therefore, in the long-term and in a uniform medium, a CheZ-null mutant accumulates CheY-P and displays an exclusive (effectively continuous) tumble phenotype.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that the cell will exclusively tumble.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1423164"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative pathway logic to quantitative prediction is a key step in systems biology.

Consider a simplified model of a receptor cluster, such as those formed by Methyl-accepting Chemotaxis Proteins (MCPs), that controls the activity of the histidine kinase CheA.\n\nThe entire cluster is treated as a single cooperative unit that can exist in two distinct conformational states: an active (ON) state and an inactive (OFF) state. The phosphorylation activity of CheA is directly proportional to the probability, $P_{\\text{ON}}$, that the receptor cluster is in the ON state.\n\nThis receptor cluster has a total of $N$ identical and independent binding sites. In the absence of any bound signaling molecules (ligands), the free energy of the ON state is greater than that of the OFF state by an amount $F_0$. We define a dimensionless free energy difference $E = F_0 / (k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nThe cluster is situated in an environment containing two different attractant ligands, which we will call Ligand 1 and Ligand 2, at constant concentrations $[L_1]$ and $[L_2]$, respectively.
