This network consists of three transcription factors, TF-A, TF-B, and TF-C, which are suspected to regulate a target gene, Gene G. To understand the regulatory logic, the biologist conducts a series of experiments where the presence or absence of each transcription factor is controlled, and the resulting expression of Gene G is observed. In this simplified Boolean model, a state of '1' signifies presence or expression (ON), while '0' signifies absence or non-expression (OFF).

The model is a penalized linear regression, where a regularization parameter, denoted by $\\lambda$, controls the model's complexity. A smaller $\\lambda$ leads to a more complex model, while a larger $\\lambda$ results in a simpler model by shrinking some regulatory coefficients to exactly zero.\n\nTo determine the optimal value of $\\lambda$, the biologist performed a parameter sweep. The available gene expression dataset was partitioned into $K=5$ equally sized, disjoint subsets, often called \"folds\". For each candidate value of $\\lambda$, a model was trained using the data from $K-1=4$ folds and then evaluated on the remaining fold (the \"test fold\"). This process was repeated $K=5$ times, with each fold serving as the test fold exactly once.
