The analysis covers the entire mouse genome, comprising $N_{total} = 22,000$ genes. A standard significance threshold of $\\alpha = 0.05$ is used for each individual gene hypothesis test. After an initial survey of the results, the researcher decides to focus on a pre-defined set of genes known to be involved in metabolic pathways, which consists of $N_{subset} = 800$ genes. Within this subset, the researcher reports finding $k = 45$ genes with an uncorrected p-value less than the threshold of $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nTo critically evaluate this finding, we want to determine what to expect from random chance alone. Assuming that the treatment has no actual effect on any gene (i.e., the null hypothesis of no differential expression is true for all 22,000 genes), what is the expected number of genes in the metabolic pathway subset that would show a p-value less than 0.05?\n\nA. 0.05\n\nB. 1\n\nC. 40\n\nD. 45\n\nE. 1100", "solution": "Assume the null hypothesis is true for all genes, so each gene’s p-value is uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$.

The team wants to control the probability of making at least one false discovery (a Type I error) across all 5,000 tests. They decide to maintain a strict Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) of 0.05. To achieve this, they will use the Bonferroni correction to adjust the significance threshold for each individual protein test.\n\nCalculate the new significance threshold, often denoted as $\\alpha'$, that must be used for each of the 5,000 individual statistical tests.
