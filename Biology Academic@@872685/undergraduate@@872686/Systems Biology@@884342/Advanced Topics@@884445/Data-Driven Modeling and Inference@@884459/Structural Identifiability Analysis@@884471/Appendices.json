In this circuit, an activator protein, denoted as $A$, binds to a specific promoter region, denoted as $P$, on a plasmid. This binding event initiates the transcription of a reporter gene, producing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The rate of transcription initiation, $v$, is assumed to follow a simple bimolecular law:\n$$v = k \\cdot c_A \\cdot c_P$$\nwhere $k$ is the intrinsic association rate constant, $c_A$ is the intracellular concentration of the activator protein $A$, and $c_P$ is the intracellular concentration of the promoter region $P$.\n\nThe biologist can design an experiment where the concentration of the activator, $c_A$, can be precisely controlled and varied. The resulting transcription rate, $v$, can be measured by observing the rate of increase in fluorescence. However, the concentration of the promoter, $c_P$, while constant throughout the experiment (as it is determined by the stable plasmid copy number in the cell population), is unknown and difficult to measure directly.\n\nThe primary goal of the experiment is to determine the value of the intrinsic rate constant $k$. Based on this experimental setup—where $c_A$ is the independent variable and $v$ is the measured dependent variable—which of the following statements about the determination of $k$ is correct?\n\nA. The constant $k$ can be uniquely determined from the experimental data.\n\nB. Neither $k$ nor any combination of parameters involving $k$ can be determined.\n\nC. The constant $k$ cannot be uniquely determined, but the product $k \\cdot c_P$ can be determined as a single lumped parameter.\n\nD. The constant $k$ cannot be uniquely determined, but the ratio $\\frac{k}{c_P}$ can be determined as a single lumped parameter.\n\nE. The constant $k$ can be determined only if the experiment is repeated at two different but known temperatures.", "solution": "We begin with the stated mass-action kinetics for transcription initiation under a simple bimolecular association between activator $A$ and promoter $P$:\n$$\nv = k \\cdot c_{A} \\cdot c_{P},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the intrinsic association rate constant, $c_{A}$ is the controllable intracellular concentration of activator $A$, and $c_{P}$ is the (unknown) but constant intracellular concentration of promoter $P$ during the experiment.\n\nBecause $c_{A}$ is varied by design and $v$ is measured, while $c_{P}$ remains constant but unknown, we can rearrange the relationship as a linear function of $c_{A}$:\n$$\nv(c_{A}) = \\left(k \\cdot c_{P}\\right) \\cdot c_{A}.\n$$\nThis shows that $v$ is proportional to $c_{A}$ with slope equal to the lumped parameter $k \\cdot c_{P}$. Therefore, by fitting the measured $(c_{A}, v)$ data to a straight line through the origin, the experiment determines the slope\n$$\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{v}{c_{A}} = k \\cdot c_{P}.\n$$\nSince $c_{P}$ is unknown and not measured, the intrinsic constant $k$ itself cannot be uniquely determined from these data alone. However, the product $k \\cdot c_{P}$ is identifiable and can be determined as a single lumped parameter.\n\nTo assess alternative statements: \n- Unique identification of $k$ (option A) fails because $k$ and $c_{P}$ are confounded multiplicatively in the model.\n- The claim that no parameter combination is determinable (option B) is false because $k \\cdot c_{P}$ is directly determined as the slope.\n- The ratio $\\frac{k}{c_{P}}$ (option D) does not appear in the linear relation; instead, $\\frac{v}{c_{A}} = k \\cdot c_{P}$, so the ratio is not identifiable.\n- Repeating at two known temperatures (option E) would provide two slopes $s_{1} = k_{1} c_{P}$ and $s_{2} = k_{2} c_{P}$, which allows determining only the ratio $\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}} = \\frac{s_{1}}{s_{2}}$ under the assumption that $c_{P}$ is unchanged across temperatures, but not the absolute value of $k$ without independent knowledge of $c_{P}$ or an additional, independently calibrated relation (e.g., an Arrhenius law with known parameters). Thus, this does not enable unique determination of $k$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that $k$ cannot be uniquely determined, but the product $k \\cdot c_{P}$ can be determined as a single lumped parameter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1468734"}, {"introduction": "Real-world experiments often face practical limitations, such as a delay in when measurements can begin.
