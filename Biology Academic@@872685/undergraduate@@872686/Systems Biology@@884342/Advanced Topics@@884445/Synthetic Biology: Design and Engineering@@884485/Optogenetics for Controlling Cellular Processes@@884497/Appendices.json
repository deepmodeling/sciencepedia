The protein is engineered to switch from an inactive state to an active state upon illumination with blue light. When the light source is turned off, the protein spontaneously reverts from its active configuration back to the inactive state through a thermal relaxation process. This reversion is observed to follow first-order kinetics. Experimental measurements reveal that the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of the active state in the dark is 300 seconds.\n\nCalculate the first-order thermal reversion rate constant, $k_{rev}$, for this process.

The system involves a light-sensitive transcription factor (TF) that exists in two states: an inactive form (concentration denoted by $TF_{i}$) and an active form (concentration denoted by $TF_{a}$). The total concentration of this transcription factor, $TF_{tot} = TF_{i} + TF_{a}$, remains constant within the cell.\n\nThe dynamics of the circuit under continuous illumination are modeled by the following set of rules:\n\n1.  **Activation:** The inactive transcription factor $TF_{i}$ is converted to its active form $TF_{a}$ by light. This is a first-order process where the rate of formation of $TF_{a}$ is given by $k_{act} TF_{i}$. The constant $k_{act}$ depends on the intensity of the incident light.\n2.  **Reversion:** The active form $TF_{a}$ spontaneously reverts back to the inactive form $TF_{i}$ through a thermal process. This is also a first-order process, with the rate of reversion given by $k_{rev} TF_{a}$.\n3.  **Protein Synthesis:** The active transcription factor $TF_{a}$ promotes the production of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which serves as a reporter. The concentration of GFP is denoted by $P$. The rate of synthesis of the protein is directly proportional to the concentration of the active transcription factor, given by $k_{p} TF_{a}$.\n4.  **Protein Removal:** The GFP is cleared from the cell through a combination of enzymatic degradation and dilution due to cell division. This removal is modeled as a first-order process with a rate given by $k_{d} P$.\n\nAssuming the system has been under continuous illumination for a long time and has reached a steady state, determine the steady-state concentration of the GFP, denoted as $P_{ss}$.

This final practice shifts our focus from calculation to critical thinking about experimental design, a cornerstone of reliable science. You are tasked with devising a definitive control experiment to prove that an observed cellular response is genuinely caused by the specific optogenetic tool and not by a non-specific side effect like light-induced stress [@problem_id:1456071]. This exercise highlights the importance of ruling out alternative hypotheses to make robust scientific claims.", "problem": "A student in a systems biology lab is working with a strain of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast) that has been genetically engineered for an optogenetics experiment. The yeast contains a synthetic circuit with two key components:\n1.  A gene expressing a transcription factor, \"OptoActivator,\" which is designed to bind to a specific DNA promoter sequence only when activated by blue light with a wavelength of 470 nm.\n2.  A reporter gene encoding the red fluorescent protein \"mCherry,\" whose expression is controlled exclusively by this specific DNA promoter.\n\nThe student cultures the engineered yeast and exposes it to a constant intensity of 470 nm blue light for one hour. Following the exposure, a measurement of the culture's fluorescence indicates a substantial increase in the amount of mCherry protein compared to a culture kept in the dark.\n\nThe student's supervisor raises a concern: high-intensity blue light can be phototoxic and induce a generic cellular stress response. It is plausible that this stress response, rather than the specific activation of OptoActivator, is causing an increase in mCherry expression.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs serves as the most direct and definitive control to test whether the observed mCherry production is a result of the specific OptoActivator mechanism and not a generic blue-light-induced stress response?\n\nA. Expose the original engineered yeast strain to 470 nm blue light at half the original intensity for one hour and measure the mCherry fluorescence.\n\nB. Genetically engineer a new control yeast strain that is identical to the original but is missing the gene for the mCherry protein. Expose this control strain to the original intensity of 470 nm blue light for one hour.\n\nC. Genetically engineer a new control yeast strain that contains the mCherry reporter gene construct but is missing the gene for the OptoActivator transcription factor. Expose this control strain to the original intensity of 470 nm blue light for one hour and measure the mCherry fluorescence.\n\nD. Expose the original engineered yeast strain to red light (e.g., 660 nm), which does not activate OptoActivator, at the same intensity and for the same one-hour duration, and measure mCherry fluorescence.\n\nE. In the original engineered yeast strain, use quantitative proteomics to measure the levels of a common housekeeping protein, such as actin, after exposure to the original intensity of 470 nm blue light for one hour.", "solution": "Goal: discriminate between two hypotheses for the increased mCherry fluorescence after 470 nm illumination: (i) specific activation via OptoActivator binding to the promoter when illuminated, versus (ii) a generic blue-light-induced stress response that nonspecifically elevates mCherry expression.\n\nExperimental design principle: a definitive negative control removes only the specific mechanism under test while keeping all other variables (promoter, reporter, illumination conditions, genetic background) constant. If the response persists without the specific component, it supports a nonspecific mechanism; if it disappears, it supports the specific mechanism.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A changes the light intensity but does not eliminate either pathway; both specific activation and stress responses may scale with intensity. This cannot attribute the effect uniquely to the specific mechanism.\n- Option B removes the reporter (mCherry), making it impossible to observe the readout of promoter activity. This tests for false-positive fluorescence or autofluorescence but does not address whether the promoter is driven by stress versus OptoActivator.\n- Option C removes OptoActivator while retaining the same promoter-mCherry construct and illumination. If mCherry still increases under blue light in this strain, the effect must be due to a nonspecific mechanism (e.g., stress). If mCherry does not increase, it indicates that OptoActivator is required and the effect is specific. This is the most direct and definitive control because it isolates the specific pathway by deletion of its essential component.\n- Option D changes the wavelength to one that does not activate OptoActivator. However, blue-light-specific stress would not be reproduced by red light, so a negative result under red light would not exclude blue-light stress as the cause. Thus it is not definitive for distinguishing blue-specific stress from OptoActivator activation.\n- Option E measures a housekeeping protein to assess stress, but even if stress markers change, this does not establish whether mCherry induction is mediated by the promoter via OptoActivator or by a parallel nonspecific route; it is correlative, not definitive.\n\nConclusion: the most direct and definitive control is to use the promoter-mCherry reporter strain lacking OptoActivator and test mCherry induction under the same blue-light conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1456071"}]}
