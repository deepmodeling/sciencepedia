A core concept in SBOL is the `ComponentDefinition`, which represents a biological part like a promoter or a gene. These parts are assembled into larger functional units, like plasmids, by specifying their relative order.\n\nA synthetic biologist is designing a library of plasmids to express various proteins in a host organism. Each plasmid is designed as a simple expression cassette with a fixed architecture: one Promoter, followed by one Ribosome Binding Site (RBS), followed by one Coding Sequence (CDS), and finally one Terminator. A unique plasmid design is defined by the specific combination of these four parts.\n\nThe biologist has a library of characterized parts, categorized by their role:\n-   **Promoters (`P`):** A set of 5 distinct promoters, `{P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}`.\n-   **Ribosome Binding Sites (`RBS`):** A set of 4 distinct RBSs, `{R1, R2, R3, R4}`.\n-   **Coding Sequences (`CDS`):** A set of 6 distinct CDSs, `{C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6}`.\n-   **Terminators (`T`):** A set of 3 distinct terminators, `{T1, T2, T3}`.\n\nHowever, not all combinations of these parts are functional. The following compatibility constraints must be respected:\n\n1.  Due to molecular interactions, promoter `P1` is incompatible with RBS `R2`. Any cassette containing this specific promoter-RBS pair is invalid.\n2.  The protein encoded by `C3` is toxic at high expression levels. Therefore, `C3` must only be driven by a low-strength promoter. The set of low-strength promoters is `{P1, P2, P3}`. Any cassette where `C3` is preceded by a promoter not in this set is invalid.\n3.  Terminator `T1` is a highly specialized, ribozyme-based terminator that is engineered to function correctly only when it follows the specific coding sequence `C5`. Any cassette where `T1` follows a CDS other than `C5` is invalid.\n\nBased on the provided library of parts and the specified compatibility constraints, calculate the total number of unique, valid expression cassette designs that can be assembled.", "solution": "Let the sets of parts be $P=\\{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\\}$, $R=\\{R_{1},R_{2},R_{3},R_{4}\\}$, $C=\\{C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4},C_{5},C_{6}\\}$, and $T=\\{T_{1},T_{2},T_{3}\\}$.

A key strategy to shorten the response time of a circuit is to enhance the degradation rate of its protein products.\n\nConsider a simple genetic circuit designed to produce a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) as a reporter. The production of RFP is initiated by an inducer molecule and proceeds at a constant rate, $\\alpha$. The RFP molecule itself is subject to a natural, intrinsic degradation process within the cell, which can be modeled as a first-order reaction with a rate constant $k_{nat}$.\n\nTo create a \"fast-off\" version of this circuit, a synthetic biologist fuses a protein degradation tag to the RFP. This tag is recognized by the cell's proteolytic machinery, introducing an additional, independent degradation pathway. This tag-mediated degradation is also a first-order process, characterized by a rate constant $k_{tag}$. The total degradation rate for the tagged protein is the sum of the natural and tag-mediated rates.\n\nLet's assume the circuit is allowed to run in the presence of the inducer until the RFP concentration reaches a steady state. At time $t=0$, the inducer is completely removed, and protein production instantly ceases. The \"turn-off time\" of the circuit is defined as the time it takes for the RFP concentration to fall to precisely $5\\%$ of its initial steady-state value.\n\nYour task is to quantify the performance improvement conferred by the degradation tag.
