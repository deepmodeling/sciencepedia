The protein U represses the gene that produces V, and conversely, V represses the gene that produces U. This mutual repression can lead to bistability, where the system has two stable steady states.\n\nA simplified mathematical model describing the time evolution of the concentrations of these two proteins, denoted by $u(t)$ and $v(t)$, is given by the following system of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha_1}{1 + v^n} - \\delta_1 u\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha_2}{1 + u^m} - \\delta_2 v\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are the maximal synthesis rates for U and V, respectively. $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are the effective degradation and dilution rates.

A key tool for this analysis is the concept of nullclines. The u-nullcline is defined as the set of all points $(u,v)$ in the phase plane where the net rate of change of the concentration of protein U is zero.\n\nFor the system described, find the expression for the concentration $u$ along the u-nullcline.
