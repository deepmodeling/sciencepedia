Consider a simplified model of a batch CFPS reaction designed to produce a specific fluorescent protein. The system is initiated with a constant concentration of messenger RNA (mRNA), denoted as $R_0$, which serves as the template for protein synthesis.\n\nThe process of protein synthesis, or translation, occurs at a rate directly proportional to the mRNA concentration, with a translation rate constant $k_{tl}$.
