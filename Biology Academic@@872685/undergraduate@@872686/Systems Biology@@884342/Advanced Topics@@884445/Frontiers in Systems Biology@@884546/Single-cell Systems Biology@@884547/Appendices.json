At the heart of cellular function is the dynamic balance between the production and degradation of proteins. This exercise invites you to calculate the average number of protein molecules at steady state, connecting the microscopic rates of synthesis and decay to a macroscopic, predictable cellular property. By working through this foundational model [@problem_id:1466140], you will gain a quantitative grasp of how simple rules govern the complex protein landscape within a cell.", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, a researcher is studying a single-cell organism that has been engineered to produce a specific protein. The production and degradation of this protein can be described by a simple stochastic model. New protein molecules are synthesized at a constant average rate, $k_s$. Each existing protein molecule has a constant probability per unit time of being degraded, described by a first-order rate constant, $\\gamma_p$.\n\nExperimental measurements for this system have determined the following parameters:\n- The average synthesis rate, $k_s$, is 120 molecules per minute.\n- The degradation rate constant, $\\gamma_p$, is 3.0 per hour.\n\nAssuming the system has reached a statistical steady state, calculate the expected (average) number of protein molecules present in a single cell.", "solution": "Let $N(t)$ denote the protein copy number and let $n(t) = \\mathbb{E}[N(t)]$ be its mean.

While data imputation methods can help fill in these gaps, they are not without risk. This exercise serves as a crucial case study, guiding you through a calculation that reveals how imputation can inadvertently create false correlations between genes [@problem_id:1466146]. This hands-on demonstration underscores the importance of critically evaluating every step in a bioinformatics pipeline to avoid drawing erroneous biological conclusions.", "problem": "In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), the expression level of thousands of genes is measured across thousands of individual cells. A common issue with this technology is the phenomenon of \"dropouts,\" where a gene that is actually expressed in a cell is not detected, resulting in a zero count in the final data matrix. These technical artifacts can complicate downstream analyses, such as determining relationships between genes.\n\nTo address this, bioinformaticians often use imputation algorithms to estimate the missing values. However, these methods can sometimes introduce new, artificial relationships that were not present in the original biological system.\n\nConsider a simplified scRNA-seq experiment measuring the expression of two genes, Gene A and Gene B, across four cells: Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3, and Cell 4. Due to dropouts, the observed expression matrix is as follows:\n\n| | Gene A | Gene B |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **Cell 1** | 10 | 0 |\n| **Cell 2** | 10 | 10 |\n| **Cell 3** | 0 | 1 |\n| **Cell 4** | 1 | 10 |\n\nYou are tasked with applying a simple imputation algorithm to this matrix. The algorithm is a simplified version of k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) imputation with $k=1$. For each zero entry in the matrix, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Identify the single nearest neighbor to the cell containing the zero. The distance between cells is the standard Euclidean distance calculated using their observed expression vectors (i.e., the corresponding row in the table).\n2. Replace the zero with that gene's expression value from the identified nearest neighbor cell.\n\nThis imputation is performed for all zero entries to produce a dense, imputed matrix. After completing the imputation, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the expression of Gene A and Gene B.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the observed expression vectors for the four cells be\n$$\nx_{1}=(10,0),\\quad x_{2}=(10,10),\\quad x_{3}=(0,1),\\quad x_{4}=(1,10).\n$$\nThe Euclidean distance between cells $i$ and $j$ is\n$$\nd(x_{i},x_{j})=\\sqrt{(A_{i}-A_{j})^{2}+(B_{i}-B_{j})^{2}}.\n$$\n\nFor Cell 1 (has a zero in Gene B), compute distances:\n$$\nd(x_{1},x_{2})=\\sqrt{(10-10)^{2}+(0-10)^{2}}=10,\\quad\nd(x_{1},x_{3})=\\sqrt{(10-0)^{2}+(0-1)^{2}}=\\sqrt{101},\\quad\nd(x_{1},x_{4})=\\sqrt{(10-1)^{2}+(0-10)^{2}}=\\sqrt{181}.\n$$\nThe nearest neighbor is Cell 2.
