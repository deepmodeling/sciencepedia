This strain exclusively uses the Glycolysis pathway to break down glucose into pyruvate. You are tasked with analyzing the carbon flow through this pathway using stable isotope tracers. The key steps and carbon atom mappings of the pathway in this organism have been determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Phosphorylation and Isomerization**: A molecule of glucose (a 6-carbon sugar, with carbons numbered sequentially from C1 to C6) is converted into Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). This initial stage does not alter the carbon numbering; glucose C$n$ becomes FBP C$n$.\n\n2.  **Cleavage**: One molecule of FBP is cleaved by the enzyme aldolase into two 3-carbon molecules: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). The carbon atoms are mapped as follows:\n    *   FBP carbons C1, C2, and C3 become DHAP carbons C1, C2, and C3, respectively.\n    *   FBP carbons C4, C5, and C6 become G3P carbons C1, C2, and C3, respectively.\n\n3.  **Isomerization**: DHAP is rapidly and completely isomerized into G3P by the enzyme Triose Phosphate Isomerase. This ensures all carbon from glucose proceeds down the pathway as G3P. The carbon mapping for this conversion is direct: DHAP C$n$ becomes G3P C$n$.\n\n4.  **Payoff Phase**: Both molecules of G3P are subsequently converted into pyruvate. Pyruvate is a 3-carbon molecule, with its carbons numbered C1 (carboxyl group), C2 (keto group), and C3 (methyl group).
