The fractions $\\phi_R$ and $\\phi_E$ are part of a larger pool of proteins directly involved in growth, which together make up a constant total fraction $\\phi_{max}$ of the entire proteome. Therefore, the fractions are constrained by the equation $\\phi_R + \\phi_E = \\phi_{max}$.\n\nConsider a wild-type strain of this bacterium where the fraction of the proteome dedicated to these growth-related proteins is $\\phi_{max} = 0.70$.

This mutation affects the 30S ribosomal subunit, reducing the overall effectiveness of ribosomes in protein synthesis. This is modeled as a 5% reduction in the efficiency constant $c$ compared to the wild-type.
