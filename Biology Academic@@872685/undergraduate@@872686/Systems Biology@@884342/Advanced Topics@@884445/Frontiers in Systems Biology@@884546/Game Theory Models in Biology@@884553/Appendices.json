The food provides a fitness benefit of $V$ to the larva that consumes it. Each larva can adopt one of two strategies: 'Fight' (the Hawk strategy) or 'Share' (the Dove strategy).\n\nIf both larvae choose to 'Fight', they engage in combat. There is an equal probability of winning, and the winner consumes the food. The loser incurs a fitness cost $C$ due to injury, while the winner is unharmed. If one larva chooses 'Fight' and the other chooses 'Share', the fighter easily takes the food without a struggle, and the sharer receives no benefit and no cost. If both larvae choose to 'Share', they divide the resource equally, each gaining a fitness benefit of $V/2$.\n\nThe larvae are siblings with a coefficient of relatedness $r$, where $0  r  1$. An individual's success is measured by its inclusive fitness, which is the sum of its own fitness payoff and the fitness payoff of its opponent multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness $r$. A strategy is considered an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), a central concept in game theory, if a population of individuals using that strategy cannot be invaded by a small number of individuals (mutants) adopting an alternative strategy.\n\nAssuming that the benefit of winning $V$ is greater than the cost of injury $C$, determine the minimum value for the benefit-to-cost ratio, $V/C$, for the 'Fight' strategy to be a pure ESS in this sibling rivalry. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $r$.", "solution": "Let the direct material payoffs be defined as follows. If both play Fight (H vs H), each wins with probability $1/2$, so the expected direct payoff to a focal individual is $(V-C)/2$. If Fight meets Share (H vs D), the fighter gets $V$ and the sharer gets $0$. If both Share (D vs D), each gets $V/2$.\n\nInclusive fitness for a focal individual is its own direct payoff plus $r$ times the opponent’s direct payoff.

The decision is modeled using principles of evolutionary game theory, where the \"payoff\" is an individual's biological fitness.\n\nThe baseline fitness for any individual is $W_0$.\n- **Strategy 1: Vaccinate.** An individual who vaccinates incurs a small, direct fitness cost, $c$.

Let $p$ be the fraction of the population that is vaccinated. The probability of an unvaccinated individual getting infected during the season is given by $P_{inf} = k(1-p)$, where $k$ is a transmission factor related to the disease's infectivity. A vaccinated individual's probability of getting infected is reduced by the vaccine's efficacy, and is thus $(1-\\epsilon)P_{inf}$.
