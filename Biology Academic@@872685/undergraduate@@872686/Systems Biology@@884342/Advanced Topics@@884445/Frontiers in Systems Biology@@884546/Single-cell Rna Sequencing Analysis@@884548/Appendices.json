One common indicator of poor cell health, such as stress or membrane rupture, is a disproportionately high percentage of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts originating from the mitochondrion. Healthy, intact cells typically have a low mitochondrial gene expression percentage.\n\nA bioinformatician has analyzed a large population of cells and summarized the distribution of mitochondrial gene percentages. The statistical summary reveals that the first quartile (Q1) of the distribution is 3.5% and the third quartile (Q3) is 9.0%.\n\nTo objectively remove outlier cells with high mitochondrial content, a common statistical approach is to set an upper threshold based on the interquartile range (IQR). The rule defines this threshold as $Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR$, where the $IQR = Q3 - Q1$. Any cell with a mitochondrial gene percentage exceeding this threshold is considered low-quality and is removed from subsequent analysis.\n\nCalculate the numerical value of this filtering threshold. Express your final answer as a decimal value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The upper outlier threshold is defined by the rule $Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR$ with $IQR = Q3 - Q1$. The problem gives the quartiles as percentages, $Q1 = 3.5\\%$ and $Q3 = 9.0\\%$. We convert these to decimal form for the calculation: $Q1 = 0.035$ and $Q3 = 0.090$.\n\nFirst, compute the interquartile range:\n$$\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 0.090 - 0.035 = 0.055.\n$$\nNext, compute the outlier threshold:\n$$\n\\text{Threshold} = Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR = 0.090 + 1.5 \\times 0.055 = 0.090 + 0.0825 = 0.1725.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the threshold is $0.173$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.173}$$", "id": "1465907"}, {"introduction": "After ensuring data quality and clustering cells into populations, a core task is to discover what makes them biologically distinct.
