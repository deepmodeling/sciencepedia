The model is formulated as a large system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that track the time-evolution of the concentrations of thousands of molecular species, including metabolites, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and proteins. The model assumes the cell is a single, well-mixed compartment, meaning spatial variations in concentrations are ignored.\n\nThe WCM is calibrated and then used to simulate the bacterium's life cycle in a virtual medium with nutrient concentrations identical to those used in a corresponding laboratory experiment. The experimental measurements show that *S. rapidus* has a consistent cell division time of $T_{\\text{exp}}$. However, the simulation consistently predicts a cell division time $T_{\\text{sim}}$ that is approximately twice the experimental value (i.e., $T_{\\text{sim}} \\approx 2 T_{\\text{exp}}$).
