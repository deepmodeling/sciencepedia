The organism consumes a single substrate (S) to produce biomass (X) and a metabolic byproduct (B). Its simplified metabolism can be described by the following fluxes, all expressed in units of millimoles per gram of Dry Weight per hour (mmol/gDW/h):\n\n1.  $v_1$: Uptake of external substrate S.\n2.  $v_3$: A flux of carbon directed towards biomass synthesis.\n3.  $v_4$: Secretion flux of byproduct B.\n4.  $v_5$: A flux of carbon required for non-growth associated maintenance energy, which is constant.\n\nThe specific growth rate of the organism, $\\mu$ (in h⁻¹), is directly proportional to the biomass synthesis flux, $v_3$, according to the relation $\\mu = Y_{\\mu/C} v_3$, where $Y_{\\mu/C}$ is a known yield coefficient.

We will first analyze the WT culture to determine this time, and then use it to find the biomass of the KO culture.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the Wild-Type (WT) Culture**\n\nThe WT organism's objective is to maximize its specific growth rate, $\\mu$. Since $\\mu = Y_{\\mu/C} v_3$ and $Y_{\\mu/C}$ is a positive constant, this is equivalent to maximizing the biomass synthesis flux, $v_3$.\n\nThe constraints for the WT organism are:\n1. $v_1 - v_3 - v_4 - v_5 = 0$\n2. $v_1 \\le v_{1,max} = 10.0$\n3. $v_3 \\le v_{3,max} = 4.0$\n4. $v_5 = 1.0$\n5. $v_1, v_3, v_4 \\ge 0$\n\nTo maximize $v_3$, the organism will set $v_3$ to its highest possible value, which is $v_{3,max} = 4.0$ mmol/gDW/h. To support this, the organism will take up substrate at the maximum possible rate, so $v_1 = v_{1,max} = 10.0$ mmol/gDW/h.\n\nWe can now use the flux balance equation to find the byproduct secretion flux, $v_4$:\n$v_{4,WT} = v_{1,WT} - v_{3,WT} - v_5 = 10.0 - 4.0 - 1.0 = 5.0$ mmol/gDW/h.\nSince $v_{4,WT} > 0$, this is a valid metabolic state. All constraints are satisfied.\n\nNow we can determine the specific growth rate for the WT strain:\n$\\mu_{WT} = Y_{\\mu/C} \\cdot v_{3,WT} = 0.1 \\cdot 4.0 = 0.4$ h⁻¹.\n\nThe biomass grows exponentially: $X(t) = X(0) \\exp(\\mu_{WT} t)$. The substrate is consumed according to $\\frac{dS_{ext}}{dt} = -v_{1,WT} X(t)$. We need to find the time, $T_{WT}$, when all substrate is consumed.\n$S_{ext}(T_{WT}) - S_{ext}(0) = \\int_{0}^{T_{WT}} \\frac{dS_{ext}}{dt} dt = \\int_{0}^{T_{WT}} -v_{1,WT} X(t) dt$\n$0 - S_{ext}(0) = -v_{1,WT} \\int_{0}^{T_{WT}} X(0) \\exp(\\mu_{WT} t) dt$\n$S_{ext}(0) = v_{1,WT} X(0) \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(\\mu_{WT} t)}{\\mu_{WT}} \\right]_{0}^{T_{WT}}$\n$S_{ext}(0) = \\frac{v_{1,WT} X(0)}{\\mu_{WT}} (\\exp(\\mu_{WT} T_{WT}) - 1)$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n$150 = \\frac{10.0 \\cdot 0.1}{0.4} (\\exp(0.4 T_{WT}) - 1)$\n$150 = \\frac{1.0}{0.4} (\\exp(0.4 T_{WT}) - 1)$\n$150 \\cdot 0.4 = \\exp(0.4 T_{WT}) - 1$\n$60 = \\exp(0.4 T_{WT}) - 1$\n$\\exp(0.4 T_{WT}) = 61$\n\nThis equation gives us the time $T_{WT}$, but we can use the term $\\exp(0.4 T_{WT})$ directly in the next step.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of the Knockout (KO) Culture**\n\nThe KO mutant has the same objective (maximize $v_3$) and constraints, with the additional constraint that $v_4 = 0$.\n\nThe balance equation for the KO becomes: $v_1 - v_3 - v_5 = 0$, or $v_1 = v_3 + v_5$.\n\nTo maximize $v_3$, the cell will again try to set it to $v_{3,max} = 4.0$ mmol/gDW/h. Let's check if this is possible. If $v_3 = 4.0$, the required substrate uptake from the balance equation is:\n$v_{1,KO} = v_{3,max} + v_5 = 4.0 + 1.0 = 5.0$ mmol/gDW/h.\n\nThis required uptake rate $v_{1,KO}=5.0$ is less than the maximum possible uptake rate $v_{1,max}=10.0$. Thus, this state is achievable. The KO strain will operate with the following fluxes:\n- $v_{3,KO} = v_{3,max} = 4.0$ mmol/gDW/h\n- $v_{1,KO} = 5.0$ mmol/gDW/h\n- $v_{4,KO} = 0$\n\nThe specific growth rate for the KO strain is:\n$\\mu_{KO} = Y_{\\mu/C} \\cdot v_{3,KO} = 0.1 \\cdot 4.0 = 0.4$ h⁻¹.\n\nInterestingly, the specific growth rate of the KO mutant is identical to that of the WT strain ($\\mu_{KO} = \\mu_{WT} = 0.4$ h⁻¹). The difference is that the KO strain consumes substrate at a slower rate ($v_{1,KO}  v_{1,WT}$).\n\n**Part 3: Final Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the biomass of the KO culture at time $t = T_{WT}$. The biomass of the KO culture grows according to:\n$X_{KO}(t) = X(0) \\exp(\\mu_{KO} t)$\n\nSubstituting $t = T_{WT}$ and $\\mu_{KO} = 0.4$ h⁻¹:\n$X_{KO}(T_{WT}) = X(0) \\exp(0.4 T_{WT})$\n\nFrom our analysis of the WT strain in Part 1, we found that $\\exp(0.4 T_{WT}) = 61$. We can substitute this directly:\n$X_{KO}(T_{WT}) = 0.1 \\cdot 61 = 6.1$ g/L.\n\nThe final answer must be rounded to three significant figures. In this case, 6.10 g/L.\n\nSo, at the moment the WT culture starves, the KO culture, which started with the same initial biomass and grew at the same specific rate, has reached a biomass concentration of 6.10 g/L.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.10}$$", "id": "1430297"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice integrates a more complex and realistic dynamic element into our model: feedback from the environment.
