This practice challenges you to think like a scientist troubleshooting an experiment, connecting the physical steps of the spatial transcriptomics workflow to the raw data output. By diagnosing the potential causes of unexpectedly low gene expression counts, you will develop a critical understanding of data quality assessment. [@problem_id:1467310]", "problem": "You are a junior research scientist analyzing data from a Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) experiment. ST is a technique that quantifies gene expression and maps it to its spatial location within a tissue slice. The tissue is placed on a slide containing a grid of spots, each with unique DNA barcodes that capture messenger RNA (mRNA) from the cells directly above it. To ensure accurate quantification, each captured mRNA molecule is tagged with a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI), a short random sequence, before any amplification steps. The number of unique UMIs for a given gene is therefore a direct count of the original mRNA molecules present.\n\nYour experiment involves a biopsy from a dense liver tumor, a tissue known for high cellularity. Upon initial quality control analysis of the sequencing data, you notice that the average number of UMIs detected per spot across the entire tumor region is unexpectedly low. Given that a dense tissue should yield a high number of cells and thus a high mRNA content per spot, this result suggests a potential issue.\n\nBased on the standard ST experimental workflow, which of the following options represent the most likely *experimental* causes for this observation?\n\nA. Inefficient tissue permeabilization during the experiment, which is the step designed to make cell membranes porous.\n\nB. The use of a tissue sample with a high degree of mRNA degradation that occurred prior to the experiment.\n\nC.

A software error during the data processing phase that caused a systematic misalignment between the high-resolution tissue image and the spot coordinate grid.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely experimental causes for observing unexpectedly low Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts per spot in a spatial transcriptomics experiment on a dense tissue. The key is to understand the relationship between tissue density, the experimental workflow, and the meaning of UMI counts.\n\nA dense tissue is expected to have many cells overlying each capture spot. This should lead to a large number of mRNA molecules being captured, resulting in a high number of unique UMIs. The observation of low UMI counts is therefore anomalous and points to a failure in the process of capturing mRNA. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Inefficient tissue permeabilization during the experiment, which is the step designed to make cell membranes porous.**\nThis is a very likely cause. Permeabilization is a critical step where reagents are used to create pores in the cell membranes. This allows the mRNA molecules within the cells to be released and captured by the oligonucleotide probes on the slide's spots. If this step is inefficient (under-permeabilization), the mRNA will remain trapped inside the cells and will not be captured. This directly leads to a lower number of captured molecules, and thus a lower count of unique UMIs. Therefore, this option is a correct and plausible explanation.\n\n**B. The use of a tissue sample with a high degree of mRNA degradation that occurred prior to the experiment.**\nThis is also a very likely cause. The entire premise of transcriptomics is to measure intact mRNA. If the tissue sample was not handled correctly (e.g., slow freezing, improper storage), enzymes like RNases can degrade the mRNA molecules into small fragments. These fragmented RNA molecules cannot be effectively captured and reverse-transcribed into cDNA, as the capture probes typically bind to a specific part of the mRNA molecule (like the poly-A tail). A low-quality, degraded sample will naturally yield very few capturable full-length transcripts, resulting in low UMI counts. Therefore, this option is also a correct and plausible explanation.\n\n**C. Excessive amplification of the cDNA library during the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) step.**\nThis is an incorrect explanation. The purpose of UMIs is precisely to correct for biases introduced during PCR amplification. The UMI is attached to the mRNA molecule *before* the PCR step. The final UMI count represents the number of unique molecules that were initially captured, regardless of how many times each one was amplified. Excessive PCR would lead to a higher number of total sequencing reads, but the number of *unique* UMIs would remain unchanged. This option confuses total read count with UMI count and is therefore incorrect.\n\n**D. The biological characteristic that the tumor cells in this specific sample have an exceptionally high metabolic and transcriptional rate.**\nThis is an incorrect explanation because it describes a scenario that would lead to the *opposite* result. If the cells have a high transcriptional rate, they produce more mRNA. In a dense tissue, this would lead to an even *higher* expected number of mRNA molecules per spot. This would result in a *high* UMI count, which contradicts the observation of an unexpectedly low count.\n\n**E. A software error during the data processing phase that caused a systematic misalignment between the high-resolution tissue image and the spot coordinate grid.**\nThis is an incorrect explanation because the question specifically asks for *experimental* causes. An \"experimental\" cause refers to issues within the wet-lab procedure (sample handling, reagent steps, etc.). A software error in aligning the image is a *computational* or *bioinformatic* issue that occurs during the post-experiment data analysis. While such an error could lead to misinterpreting the data (e.g., assigning UMI counts from an empty region to what appears to be tissue), it is not a failure of the experiment itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the most plausible experimental failures that would lead to a global reduction in captured mRNA, and therefore low UMI counts, are a failure to release the mRNA from the cells (inefficient permeabilization) or the absence of intact mRNA to begin with (degradation).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "1467310"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful applications of spatial transcriptomics is its ability to reveal the underlying cellular architecture of a tissue without prior knowledge.
