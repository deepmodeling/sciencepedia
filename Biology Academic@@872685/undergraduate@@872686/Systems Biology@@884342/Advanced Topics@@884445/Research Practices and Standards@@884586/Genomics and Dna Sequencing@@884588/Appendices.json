The sequence of one strand of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is found to be:\n\n*P. fervidus* segment: 5'-GCCGTAGGTCGTAGCG-3'\n\nA fundamental property of a DNA double helix is its thermal stability, often quantified by its melting temperature ($T_m$), the temperature at which half of the double-stranded DNA molecules dissociate into single strands. This stability is directly related to the number of hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs. Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) via two hydrogen bonds, while Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) via three hydrogen bonds.\n\nFor comparison, the researcher also has the sequence of a homologous 16-base-pair gene segment from the mesophilic bacterium *Escherichia coli*, which thrives at moderate temperatures:\n\n*E. coli* segment: 5'-ATTATAGATTACATAT-3'\n\nA.

The E. coli segment 5'-ATTATAGATTACATAT-3' contains far fewer G and C bases (one G and one C, thus $2/16$), so its GC content is much lower than that of the Pyrococcus fervidus segment.
