They perform a series of three Affinity Purification-Mass Spectrometry (AP-MS) experiments to identify protein complexes. In each experiment, a single \"bait\" protein is used to pull down its binding partners, which are then identified as \"prey\" proteins. The results are as follows:\n\n- Experiment 1: The bait protein is P1. The identified prey proteins are {P2, P3, P4}.\n- Experiment 2: The bait protein is P2. The identified prey proteins are {P1, P4, P5}.\n- Experiment 3: The bait protein is P5. The identified prey proteins are {P2, P6}.\n\nTo build a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network from this data, the team considers two different inference models: the spoke model and the matrix model.\n\n- **Spoke Model**: In each experiment, an interaction is inferred only between the bait protein and each of the prey proteins. No interactions are inferred among prey proteins.\n- **Matrix Model**: In each experiment, it is assumed that all proteins identified (the bait and all its preys) form a fully connected complex (a clique). An interaction is thus inferred between every possible pair of proteins within that set.\n\nConsidering the data from all three experiments combined, calculate the total number of unique protein-protein interactions that would be inferred by each model. Let $N_{spoke}$ be the total number of unique interactions from the spoke model, and $N_{matrix}$ be the total number of unique interactions from the matrix model.\n\nPresent your answer as a row matrix with two elements, in the order $N_{spoke}$, then $N_{matrix}$.", "solution": "We interpret protein-protein interactions as undirected pairs.

Understanding this principle is key to comprehending genetic robustness and developing effective therapeutic strategies.", "problem": "In systems biology, Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks are often modeled as scale-free networks, characterized by the presence of a few highly connected proteins (hubs) and many proteins with few connections. The robustness of such a network to the removal of its constituent proteins is a critical question.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a PPI network consisting of a total of $N=1000$ proteins. The proteins are divided into two classes:\n1.  **Hubs**: There are $N_h = 100$ hub proteins, which have a very high number of connections (high degree).\n2.  **Peripheral Proteins**: There are $N_p = 900$ peripheral proteins, which have a low number of connections (low degree).\n\nThe connectivity of the network is defined as follows:\n*   The 100 hub proteins are all densely connected to each other, forming a single, stable core for the network.\n*   Each of the 900 peripheral proteins is connected to exactly one hub protein. These connections are distributed evenly, meaning each of the 100 hubs serves as an \"anchor\" for exactly $N_p/N_h = 9$ peripheral proteins.\n*   Peripheral proteins do not have any connections to each other.\n\nInitially, the entire network is fully connected, forming a single Largest Connected Component (LCC) of size 1000. A protein is considered disconnected if it is no longer part of this main LCC. The total damage to the network is measured by the total number of disconnected proteins, which is the initial LCC size minus the final LCC size after protein removal.\n\nYou are to compare two different strategies for removing 10% of the proteins from the network (i.e., removing 100 proteins).\n\n**Scenario A (Targeted Attack)**: The 100 proteins with the highest degree are deliberately removed. In this model, these are the 100 hub proteins.\n**Scenario B (Random Failure)**: 100 proteins are chosen completely at random from the entire network and removed.\n\nLet $D_A$ be the total number of proteins disconnected from the LCC in Scenario A, and $D_B$ be the total number of proteins disconnected in Scenario B.

The 900 remaining peripheral proteins are isolated, so the final LCC size is 1. Therefore,\n$$\nD_{A} = 1000 - 1 = 999.\n$$\n\nScenario B (Random Failure): Remove 100 nodes uniformly at random without replacement. Let $S$ be the number of surviving hubs and let $K$ be the number of peripheral proteins that both survive and have their hub survive. If $S>0$, the LCC consists of all surviving hubs plus all surviving peripherals attached to surviving hubs, i.e., size $S+K$. If $S=0$, there are only isolated peripherals, so the LCC has size $1$.
