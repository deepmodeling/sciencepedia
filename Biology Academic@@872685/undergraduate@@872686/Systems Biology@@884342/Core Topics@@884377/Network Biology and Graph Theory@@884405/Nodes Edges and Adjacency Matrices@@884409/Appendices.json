These networks can be represented mathematically as directed graphs, where nodes represent genes or signaling molecules, and edges represent regulatory interactions (activation or repression). A common way to encode such a graph is through an adjacency matrix.\n\nConsider a synthetic biological circuit engineered in a cell. This circuit consists of four key components: an external signaling molecule `S`, two genes `A` and `B`, and a reporter gene `R` that produces a fluorescent protein. The interactions within this circuit are as follows:\n1.  The presence of the signaling molecule `S` activates the expression of gene `A`.\n2.  The protein product of gene `A` represses the expression of gene `B`.\n3.  The protein product of gene `B` represses the expression of gene `A`. This forms a \"toggle switch\" between A and B.\n4.  The protein product of gene `B` activates the expression of the reporter gene `R`.\n\nThere are no other direct interactions between these four components, and no component directly regulates itself.\n\nYou are tasked with constructing the adjacency matrix, $M$, for this GRN. The element $M_{ij}$ of the matrix should represent the influence of component $j$ (the source) on component $i$ (the target). Use the following convention for the values of the matrix elements:\n-   $M_{ij} = 1$ if component $j$ activates component $i$.\n-   $M_{ij} = -1$ if component $j$ represses component $i$.\n-   $M_{ij} = 0$ if component $j$ has no direct regulatory influence on component $i$.\n\nThe rows and columns of the matrix $M$ should correspond to the components in the specific order: (`S`, `A`, `B`, `R`). Determine the resulting $4 \\times 4$ adjacency matrix $M$.", "solution": "We label the components in the specified order as indices: $1 \\to S$, $2 \\to A$, $3 \\to B$, $4 \\to R$. By definition, $M_{ij}$ represents the influence of component $j$ (source) on component $i$ (target), with $M_{ij}=1$ for activation, $M_{ij}=-1$ for repression, and $M_{ij}=0$ otherwise.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n1. $S$ activates $A$, so $M_{2,1}=1$.\n2. $A$ represses $B$, so $M_{3,2}=-1$.\n3. $B$ represses $A$, so $M_{2,3}=-1$.\n4. $B$ activates $R$, so $M_{4,3}=1$.\n\nThere are no self-regulatory edges, so $M_{ii}=0$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. There are no other direct interactions, so all unspecified entries are zero.\n\nTherefore, in the ordered basis $(S, A, B, R)$ for both rows (targets) and columns (sources), the adjacency matrix is\n$$\nM=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0&0\\\\1&0&-1&0\\\\0&-1&0&0\\\\0&0&1&0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1454315"}, {"introduction": "Once a network is represented as a matrix, we can begin to analyze its properties.

The density of such a network is a measure of its overall connectivity.\n\nConsider a hypothetical regulatory complex composed of seven distinct proteins, labeled T1 through T7. The network of interactions within this complex is undirected, meaning if T1 interacts with T2, then T2 also interacts with T1.
