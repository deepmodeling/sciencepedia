We can begin by modeling systems where the connections are simple and reciprocal, such as physical contact networks. This first practice exercise [@problem_id:1462969] asks you to represent a small household as a network to understand potential disease transmission, a common application in epidemiology. Your task is to translate the described social contacts into an adjacency matrix, a fundamental tool for representing and computationally analyzing any graph.", "problem": "Consider a small, isolated household used to model disease transmission. The household consists of four individuals: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David. Within this household, direct contact, which facilitates transmission, occurs between specific pairs. The two parents, Alice and Bob, are in direct contact with each other. Each parent is in direct contact with both of their children, Charlie and David. The two children are also in direct contact with each other. There are no other instances of direct contact.\n\nA network of potential transmission can be represented by an adjacency matrix $A$, where the entry $A_{ij}$ is 1 if individual $i$ and individual $j$ are in direct contact, and 0 otherwise. By definition, an individual does not have contact with themselves.\n\nConstruct the adjacency matrix $A$ for this household. The rows and columns of the matrix should correspond to the individuals in alphabetical order: 1. Alice, 2. Bob, 3. Charlie, 4. David. Your answer must be the complete matrix.", "solution": "We model the household as an undirected simple graph with vertices ordered as 1: Alice, 2: Bob, 3: Charlie, 4: David. By definition of the adjacency matrix $A$, we set $A_{ij}=1$ if individuals $i$ and $j$ are in direct contact and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise, with $A_{ii}=0$ since no one contacts themselves.\n\nFrom the description:\n- Alice and Bob are in contact, so $A_{12}=A_{21}=1$.\n- Each parent is in contact with each child: Alice with Charlie and David gives $A_{13}=A_{31}=1$ and $A_{14}=A_{41}=1$, Bob with Charlie and David gives $A_{23}=A_{32}=1$ and $A_{24}=A_{42}=1$.\n- The two children are in contact, so $A_{34}=A_{43}=1$.\n- No other contacts exist, and all diagonal entries are zero: $A_{11}=A_{22}=A_{33}=A_{44}=0$.\n\nThus every off-diagonal entry is $1$, and the diagonal entries are $0$, yielding\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1462969"}, {"introduction": "While undirected graphs are useful for modeling symmetric relationships, many biological processes are inherently directional.

In this exercise [@problem_id:1463020], we will model a gene regulatory network using a directed graph to capture these causal relationships. By constructing the graph and then counting the number of specific paths, you will practice tracing the flow of regulatory signals through a network, a key step in understanding its logic and potential for complex behaviors like feedback loops.", "problem": "In systems biology, gene regulatory networks are often modeled as directed graphs to analyze their structure and predict their behavior. Consider a simplified model of a gene regulatory circuit within a cell, involving an external signal and three genes. The components and their interactions are as follows:\n\n1.  An external signaling molecule, denoted by $S$, activates the expression of gene $G_1$.\n2.  The protein product of gene $G_1$ acts as a transcription factor that activates the expression of both gene $G_2$ and gene $G_3$.\n3.  The protein product of gene $G_2$ represses the expression of gene $G_1$, forming a negative feedback loop.\n4.  Gene $G_3$ is a terminal output of this particular pathway; its protein product does not regulate $S$, $G_1$, or $G_2$.\n\nThis network can be represented as a directed graph where the nodes are the four components $\\{S, G_1, G_2, G_3\\}$. A directed edge from a node $X$ to a node $Y$ exists if $X$ directly causes a change (either activation or repression) in the state or expression of $Y$.\n\nA path of length $k$ in this graph is defined as a sequence of $k+1$ nodes, $(v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k)$, such that there is a directed edge from $v_{i-1}$ to $v_i$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $k$. Calculate the total number of distinct paths of length 3 that exist within this entire network.", "solution": "We first translate the biological description into a directed graph with nodes $\\{S,G_{1},G_{2},G_{3}\\}$ and directed edges given by the stated regulatory interactions:\n- $S \\to G_{1}$ (activation of $G_{1}$ by $S$),\n- $G_{1} \\to G_{2}$ and $G_{1} \\to G_{3}$ (activation of $G_{2}$ and $G_{3}$ by $G_{1}$),\n- $G_{2} \\to G_{1}$ (repression of $G_{1}$ by $G_{2}$),\n- $G_{3}$ has no outgoing edges.\n\nA length-$3$ directed path is a sequence $(v_{0},v_{1},v_{2},v_{3})$ with edges $v_{0}\\to v_{1}\\to v_{2}\\to v_{3}$. We can count such paths either by direct enumeration or using the adjacency matrix method.\n\nUsing the adjacency matrix method, order the nodes as $(S,G_{1},G_{2},G_{3})$ and define the adjacency matrix $A$ by $A_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge from node $i$ to node $j$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise.

You will apply a set of logical rules to determine the final state of the system after a drug is used to inhibit a key protein, demonstrating how these models can provide valuable insights into the effects of therapeutic interventions.", "problem": "A simplified model of a cellular decision-making pathway is represented by a directed graph with 8 protein components, labeled P1 through P8.

All of its inhibiting upstream components are 'inactive'.\n\nIf either of these conditions is not met, the component becomes 'inactive'. A component with no activating inputs is always 'inactive'. A component with no inhibiting inputs is considered to have the second condition met by default.\n\nWe assume that, prior to any intervention, a persistent signaling environment has led to a baseline state where all 8 components are 'active'. A highly specific drug is then introduced that completely and permanently binds to component P2, forcing its state to be 'inactive'. The effects of this inhibition then propagate through the network until a new, stable equilibrium of activity states is reached for all components.\n\nCalculate the total number of components that are in the 'inactive' state in this new equilibrium.", "solution": "Let $s_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote the activity of $P_{i}$, with $1$ for active and $0$ for inactive.
