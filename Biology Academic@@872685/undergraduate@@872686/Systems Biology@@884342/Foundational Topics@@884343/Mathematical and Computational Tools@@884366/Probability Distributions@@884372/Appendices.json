An oligonucleotide is considered perfect only if no misincorporations occur.\n5.  The final answer must be a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\nValidation assessment:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem presents a simplified but standard and scientifically valid model for errors in oligonucleotide synthesis. The parameters given are realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-defined. The givens are sufficient and consistent for calculating a unique probability.\n-   **Objective:** The language is quantitative and precise, free from any subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $L$ be the length of the oligonucleotide, so $L=100$.\nLet $p_{error}$ be the probability of a misincorporation at any single position. We are given $p_{error} = \\frac{1}{500}$.\nThe incorporation events at each of the $L$ positions are independent.\nFor an oligonucleotide to be perfect, a correct incorporation must occur at every position.\nLet $p_{correct}$ be the probability of a correct incorporation at a single position. Since this is the complementary event to a misincorporation, its probability is:\n$$p_{correct} = 1 - p_{error} = 1 - \\frac{1}{500} = \\frac{499}{500}$$\nFor the entire $100$-mer to be perfect, there must be $100$ independent correct incorporations. The probability of a sequence of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\nLet $P(\\text{perfect})$ be the probability that a synthesized $100$-mer is perfect. This requires a correct incorporation at position $1$, AND at position $2$, ..., AND at position $100$.\nTherefore, $P(\\text{perfect})$ is the product of $p_{correct}$ with itself $L$ times:\n$$P(\\text{perfect}) = (p_{correct})^{L}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(\\text{perfect}) = \\left(\\frac{499}{500}\\right)^{100}$$\nThis problem can also be formally described using the binomial distribution. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of misincorporations in a sequence of length $L=100$. Then $X$ follows a binomial distribution $X \\sim B(n, p)$, where the number of trials is $n=L=100$ and the probability of \"success\" (defined here as a misincorporation) is $p=p_{error}=\\frac{1}{500}$.\nThe probability of observing exactly $k$ misincorporations is given by the probability mass function:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nA perfect oligonucleotide corresponds to the case where there are zero misincorporations, i.e., $k=0$.\n$$P(X=0) = \\binom{100}{0} \\left(\\frac{1}{500}\\right)^{0} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{500}\\right)^{100-0}$$\nUsing the identities $\\binom{n}{0} = 1$ and $x^0 = 1$ for any non-zero $x$, this simplifies to:\n$$P(X=0) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{499}{500}\\right)^{100} = \\left(\\frac{499}{500}\\right)^{100}$$\nThis confirms the initial reasoning.

The first four significant figures are $8$, $1$, $8$, and $5$. The fifth significant figure is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we must round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$P(\\text{perfect}) \\approx 0.8186$$\nThis is the final probability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8186}$$", "id": "2381059"}, {"introduction": "Moving from synthesis to analysis, our next practice delves into genomics by asking whether a specific DNA sequence, or motif, appears more or less frequently than expected by chance.
