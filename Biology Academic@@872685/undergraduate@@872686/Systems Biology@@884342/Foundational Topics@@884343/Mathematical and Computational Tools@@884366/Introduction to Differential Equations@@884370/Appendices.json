Consider one of the simplest such circuits, a \"constitutive gene expression\" module, implemented in a bacterium. In this module, a specific gene is continuously transcribed into messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) at a constant rate, denoted by $k$. Simultaneously, the mRNA molecules are actively degraded by enzymes within the cell. This degradation process is modeled as a first-order reaction, meaning the rate of decay is directly proportional to the current concentration of the mRNA, $m(t)$. The proportionality constant for this degradation is $\\gamma$. The net rate of change of the mRNA concentration over time is thus governed by the differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = k - \\gamma m(t)\n$$\n\nAssuming $k$ and $\\gamma$ are positive real constants, determine the general solution for the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$.
