A protein's function is dictated by its structure, which in turn is determined by its sequence of amino acids. Before delving into complex structural predictions or functional annotations, a crucial first step is to determine the protein's basic chemical makeup by calculating its amino acid composition [@problem_id:1418269]. This simple counting task is a fundamental building block for many advanced analyses and demonstrates how we can use programming to extract quantitative information from biological data.", "problem": "In bioinformatics, a common preliminary step in analyzing a protein is to determine its amino acid composition.

Biological systems are often complex networks of interacting components, and signaling pathways are a prime example. By representing a pathway as a graph, we can use algorithms to ask sophisticated questions about its properties, such as identifying the most efficient route for a signal to travel from a receptor to its target in the nucleus [@problem_id:1418254]. This exercise will challenge you to think abstractly and apply algorithmic logic to uncover the hidden design principles of a biological network.", "problem": "A team of systems biologists is investigating a newly discovered signaling pathway, which they have named the Stress-Adaptive Kinase Pathway (SAKP). This pathway is initiated by the activation of a membrane receptor, the Stress-Adaptive Kinase Receptor (SAKR), and culminates in the activation of a key transcription factor, the Transcription Factor for Stress Adaptation (TFSA). The team has mapped out the direct activation steps between the various protein components of this pathway. An activation step means that one protein directly causes a conformational change or phosphorylation that activates the next protein in the sequence.\n\nThe known one-way activation interactions are as follows:\n\n*   The Stress-Adaptive Kinase Receptor (SAKR) directly activates both MAPK1 and PI3K.\n*   MAPK1 directly activates MAPK2 and Raf.\n*   MAPK2 directly activates ERK.\n*   Raf directly activates MEK.\n*   MEK directly activates ERK.\n*   PI3K directly activates Akt and PDK1.\n*   PDK1 directly activates Akt.\n*   Akt directly activates mTOR and GSK3.\n*   GSK3 directly activates CREB.\n*   ERK directly activates the Transcription Factor for Stress Adaptation (TFSA).\n*   CREB directly activates the Transcription Factor for Stress Adaptation (TFSA).\n*   mTOR directly activates S6K, which is a terminal protein in its branch and does not activate any other proteins in this mapped network.\n\nGiven these interactions, determine the length of the shortest signaling cascade connecting the initial signal at the SAKR to the activation of the TFSA. The length of a cascade is defined as the number of individual activation steps (i.e., interactions) it contains.", "solution": "Model the signaling network as a directed graph where each protein is a node and each direct activation is a directed edge from activator to target. The length of a cascade equals the number of edges in a directed path from the source (SAKR) to the target (TFSA). We seek the shortest such path.\n\nList the outgoing edges from SAKR: SAKR activates MAPK1 and PI3K, so any path must begin with SAKR → MAPK1 or SAKR → PI3K.\n\nConsider paths reaching TFSA via ERK:\n- Path P1: SAKR → MAPK1 → MAPK2 → ERK → TFSA. This contains $4$ activation steps.\n- Path P2: SAKR → MAPK1 → Raf → MEK → ERK → TFSA. This contains $5$ activation steps.\n\nConsider paths reaching TFSA via CREB:\n- Path P3: SAKR → PI3K → Akt → GSK3 → CREB → TFSA. This contains $5$ activation steps.\n- Path P4: SAKR → PI3K → PDK1 → Akt → GSK3 → CREB → TFSA. This contains $6$ activation steps.\n\nThe mTOR branch (SAKR → PI3K → Akt → mTOR → S6K) terminates at S6K and does not reach TFSA, so it cannot yield a valid path to TFSA.\n\nNo other direct activations to TFSA are given except from ERK and CREB, and all enumerated paths to TFSA are covered by the branches above. Therefore, the minimal number of activation steps from SAKR to TFSA is achieved by Path P1 with length $4$.\n\nHence, the length of the shortest signaling cascade from SAKR to TFSA is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1418254"}]}
