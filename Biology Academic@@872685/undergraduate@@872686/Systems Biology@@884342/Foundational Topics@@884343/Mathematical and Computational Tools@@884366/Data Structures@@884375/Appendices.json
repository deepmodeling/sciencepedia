The task is to perform a single pass over the sequence and increment a counter associated to each amino acid character.\n\nWe require a mapping from each amino acid character to a counter index and an increment operation per character.\n\n- Option A (singly linked list): For each character, locating its node requires a sequential search over up to $k$ nodes, yielding per-character cost $\\Theta(k)$ and total time $T_{A}(N)=\\Theta(Nk)$. The space is $S_{A}=\\Theta(k)$ plus pointer overhead, and the non-contiguous layout harms cache locality.\n\n- Option B (fixed-size array of $k$ integers): Preassign a bijection $f:\\Sigma\\to\\{0,1,\\dots,k-1\\}$ from amino acid characters to indices.
