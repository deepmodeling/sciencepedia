A fundamental step in appreciating the scale of this biological engineering is to estimate the physical length of this genetic material if it were uncoiled and stretched out.\n\nConsider a single human somatic cell, which is diploid. The size of the human haploid genome (the genetic material in a set of 23 chromosomes) is approximately $3.2 \\times 10^9$ base pairs. The Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecule in this cell predominantly exists in a B-form double helix structure, where the average axial distance between consecutive base pairs is $0.34$ nanometers.\n\nCalculate the total end-to-end length of all the DNA molecules from this single human diploid cell if they were laid out consecutively.

The binding process between the transcription factor (TF) and the DNA promoter sequence (P) is a reversible reaction, $TF + P \\rightleftharpoons TF\\cdot P$, characterized by a dissociation constant, $K_d$. The probability of the promoter being bound is given by the fraction of promoters in the bound state, which can be expressed as $\\frac{[TF]}{[TF] + K_d}$, where $[TF]$ is the concentration of the active transcription factor.\n\nConsider a gene whose maximum rate of protein production (the rate when its promoter is always bound by the transcription factor) is $V_{max} = 450$ proteins per minute.
