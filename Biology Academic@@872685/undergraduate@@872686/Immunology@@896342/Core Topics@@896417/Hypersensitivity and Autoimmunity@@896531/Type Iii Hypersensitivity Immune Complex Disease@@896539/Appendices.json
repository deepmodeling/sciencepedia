This problem challenges you to think like a clinician by considering a common diagnostic test. By exploring why complement levels are measured in patients with suspected immune complex disease, you will solidify your understanding of the central role the complement cascade plays in the pathogenesis of these conditions. [@problem_id:2284541]", "problem": "A patient is evaluated in a rheumatology clinic with a constellation of symptoms including a skin rash, joint pain, and evidence of kidney dysfunction. These clinical findings are highly suggestive of an active systemic Type III hypersensitivity reaction, a condition mediated by the deposition of immune complexes (aggregates of antibodies and antigens) in various tissues. To help confirm this diagnosis and assess the activity of the disease, the physician orders a measurement of serum levels of two specific proteins from the complement system: C3 and C4.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the expected findings for C3 and C4 levels in this patient during an active phase of the disease and the underlying immunological mechanism?\n\nA. C3 and C4 levels are expected to be elevated, as they are acute-phase proteins whose synthesis is increased by the liver during systemic inflammation.\n\nB. C3 and C4 levels are expected to be decreased, as immune complexes are potent activators of the classical complement pathway, leading to the consumption of these components.\n\nC. C3 levels are expected to be decreased, but C4 levels are expected to be normal, because immune complexes primarily activate the alternative complement pathway, which bypasses C4.\n\nD. C3 and C4 levels are expected to be normal, as the primary mechanism for clearing immune complexes involves direct uptake by phagocytes, a process independent of the complement cascade.", "solution": "The clinical triad of rash, arthralgia, and renal involvement strongly suggests an active Type III hypersensitivity reaction driven by deposition of circulating immune complexes composed of antigen bound to IgG or IgM. Such immune complexes efficiently activate the classical complement pathway because the Fc regions of IgG or IgM in immune complexes are recognized by C1q. Binding of C1q to clustered Fc domains activates C1r and C1s, leading to cleavage of C4 to C4a and C4b and of C2 to C2a and C2b. C4b binds to nearby surfaces and associates with C2a to form the classical C3 convertase, denoted $C4b2a$. This convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b, propagating complement activation, opsonization, and inflammation.\n\nDuring an active immune complex–mediated disease, the persistent activation of the classical pathway leads to increased consumption of both C4 (cleaved early by C1s) and C3 (cleaved by $C4b2a$). As a result, serum levels of C3 and C4 decrease, and low C3 and C4 are used clinically as markers of disease activity in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus with active nephritis. Although some complement components can be acute-phase reactants synthesized by the liver, in active Type III hypersensitivity the rate of consumption by ongoing classical pathway activation typically exceeds the rate of synthesis, producing decreased levels.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because, despite hepatic synthesis, consumption during classical pathway activation lowers C3 and C4 in active immune complex disease.\n- Option B is correct because immune complexes activate the classical pathway, consuming C4 via C1s and C3 via the classical C3 convertase $C4b2a$, leading to decreased serum C3 and C4.\n- Option C is incorrect because the mechanistic trigger is classical (not alternative) pathway activation; thus C4 is also consumed and decreased.\n- Option D is incorrect because complement is integral to immune complex solubilization and clearance; it is not a complement-independent process, and complement consumption alters serum levels.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that both C3 and C4 are decreased due to consumption by immune complex–driven activation of the classical complement pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2284541"}, {"introduction": "After establishing that immune complexes activate complement, the next logical question is: what is the pathological consequence? This exercise presents a classic clinical scenario—post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis—to illustrate how the deposition of immune complexes in a specific tissue, the kidney glomerulus, leads to tangible signs of disease. Working through this problem will help you trace the complete pathway from circulating immune complexes to organ-specific damage and clinical symptoms.

The patient's history reveals a severe sore throat infection that resolved two weeks prior. A urinalysis is performed and shows significant proteinuria (presence of excess protein) and hematuria (presence of red blood cells). The condition is suspected to be post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, a kidney disease that is a classic example of a Type III hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive pathophysiological explanation for the simultaneous findings of proteinuria and hematuria in this patient?\n\nA. Circulating antibodies produced against streptococcal antigens mistakenly cross-react and bind directly to structural components of the glomerular basement membrane, marking it for destruction by phagocytes.\n\nB. Streptococcal toxins directly damage the epithelial cells of the renal tubules, impairing their ability to reabsorb filtered protein and causing erosion of tubular blood vessels.\n\nC. Pre-formed, soluble antigen-antibody immune complexes become trapped within the glomeruli, triggering complement activation and recruitment of neutrophils. These neutrophils release lytic enzymes that damage the glomerular filtration barrier, increasing its porosity.\n\nD. Autoreactive Helper T-cells recognize self-antigens on the podocytes of the glomerulus, leading to a cell-mediated immune response that destroys the filtration slits and allows leakage.\n\nE. The large size of the immune complexes physically obstructs the glomerular capillaries, leading to a build-up of hydrostatic pressure that forces proteins and red blood cells through the intact filtration barrier.", "solution": "We begin from the clinical and temporal context: a nephritic syndrome in a child occurring about two weeks after a streptococcal pharyngitis strongly suggests post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is classically a Type III hypersensitivity reaction. The core immunologic principle of Type III hypersensitivity is that soluble antigen-antibody immune complexes form in the circulation and subsequently deposit in vessel walls or tissues, where they fix complement and recruit inflammatory effector cells (especially neutrophils), whose products cause tissue injury.\n\nApplying this to the glomerulus, the steps are:\n1) After streptococcal infection, soluble streptococcal antigens remain or are released, and antibodies are produced against them. Antigen-antibody complexes form in the circulation.\n2) These pre-formed, soluble immune complexes deposit in the glomeruli (classically in subepithelial locations, producing “hump-like” deposits on electron microscopy), and along the glomerular capillary walls and mesangium. On immunofluorescence this pattern is granular rather than linear.\n3) Deposited immune complexes activate the classical complement pathway locally. Complement fragments, particularly C3a and C5a, increase vascular permeability and serve as potent chemoattractants for neutrophils.\n4) Neutrophils are recruited to the glomerulus and are activated via Fc receptors and complement receptors, releasing proteases, reactive oxygen species, and other lytic enzymes. These mediators damage the components of the glomerular filtration barrier: the fenestrated endothelium, the glomerular basement membrane, and the podocyte slit diaphragm.\n5) Structural and functional injury to this barrier increases its permeability (“porosity”) to macromolecules and cellular elements. As a result:\n   - Proteins that are normally retained (e.g., albumin) leak into Bowman space, causing proteinuria.\n   - Red blood cells traverse the damaged barrier and enter the tubular lumen, causing hematuria; red blood cell casts may form within tubules, consistent with a glomerular source of bleeding.\n\nThis mechanism directly accounts for the simultaneous presence of proteinuria and hematuria via immune complex deposition, complement activation, neutrophil-mediated inflammation, and resultant injury to the filtration barrier.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A describes antibodies directly targeting the glomerular basement membrane, which is a Type II hypersensitivity mechanism (e.g., anti-GBM disease/Goodpasture syndrome) with a linear immunofluorescence pattern, not the immune complex deposition and granular pattern typical of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.\n- B invokes direct streptococcal toxin damage of tubules causing impaired protein reabsorption and erosion of tubular vessels. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a glomerular immune complex disease, not a primary tubular toxin-mediated process; glomerular RBC leakage (with RBC casts) and complement consumption are not explained by tubular injury.\n- C correctly states that pre-formed, soluble immune complexes deposit in glomeruli, activate complement, recruit neutrophils, and that neutrophil products damage the filtration barrier, increasing permeability to proteins and RBCs. This aligns with Type III hypersensitivity and the clinicopathology of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.\n- D posits a T-cell mediated, Type IV mechanism targeting podocytes. While T-cell cytokine effects on podocytes are implicated in minimal change disease (usually causing selective proteinuria without hematuria), this does not explain the classic immune complex-mediated, complement-driven, neutrophil-rich injury and hematuria of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.\n- E suggests physical obstruction by large immune complexes raises hydrostatic pressure across an intact barrier to force proteins and RBCs through. In reality, the barrier is damaged by inflammation; intact barriers do not permit RBC passage by pressure alone, and obstruction is not the primary driver of proteinuria and hematuria in this disease.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and comprehensive explanation is the immune complex deposition with complement activation and neutrophil-mediated injury to the glomerular filtration barrier described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2284566"}, {"introduction": "Immunology is an experimental science.

In this model, an antigen is injected intradermally, followed by an intravenous injection of antibodies specific for that antigen.

The FcR-gamma chain (FcRγ) is a critical signaling subunit for the primary activating FcRs on neutrophils.\n\nThe researcher performs the experiment on three strains of mice: wild-type (WT), mice genetically deficient in complement component C5 (C5-/-), and mice deficient in the FcRγ-chain (FcRγ-/-). A control group of WT mice is injected with saline instead of the antigen-antibody combination to measure baseline inflammation. Four hours after induction, skin biopsies are taken, and the number of infiltrated neutrophils per square millimeter of tissue is counted. The average results are summarized below:\n\n*   **Group 1 (WT Control):** WT mice receiving a saline injection show an average of $25$ neutrophils/mm$^2$.\n*   **Group 2 (WT Experimental):** WT mice undergoing the Arthus reaction show an average of $915$ neutrophils/mm$^2$.\n*   **Group 3 (C5-/- Experimental):** C5-deficient mice undergoing the Arthus reaction show an average of $375$ neutrophils/mm$^2$.\n*   **Group 4 (FcRγ-/- Experimental):** FcRγ-chain-deficient mice undergoing the Arthus reaction show an average of $540$ neutrophils/mm$^2$.\n\nBased on these data, calculate the contribution of the C5-dependent pathway to the total immune complex-mediated neutrophil infiltration.
