{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly grasp the nature of Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH), we must first answer a fundamental question: what component of the immune system carries the \"memory\" of the antigen? This classic thought experiment, mirroring the historic \"adoptive transfer\" studies, challenges you to distinguish between humoral (antibody-based) and cell-mediated immunity. By determining which biological component can transfer sensitivity from a sensitized animal to a naive one, you will solidify your understanding of why DTH is the quintessential example of a T-cell-mediated response [@problem_id:2284708].", "problem": "An immunologist is conducting an experiment to investigate the mechanisms of a Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, a type of cell-mediated immune response. First, a healthy guinea pig, designated GP-S (Sensitized), is injected with an antigen derived from *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* to induce immunologic memory. Several weeks later, various biological components are isolated from GP-S. A second guinea pig, GP-N (Naive), which has never been exposed to the antigen, is used as a recipient. The goal is to transfer the specific sensitivity to the tuberculin antigen from GP-S to GP-N, such that a subsequent intradermal injection of the antigen into GP-N will cause a characteristic hardened, red lesion at the injection site after 48-72 hours.\n\nWhich of the following components, when isolated from the sensitized guinea pig (GP-S) and injected into the naive guinea pig (GP-N), would be capable of successfully transferring this DTH sensitivity?\n\nA. Serum, which is the cell-free fluid component of blood containing antibodies.\n\nB. A purified population of B-lymphocytes.\n\nC. A purified population of T-lymphocytes.\n\nD. A purified population of neutrophils.\n\nE. A suspension of red blood cells.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the immunologic mechanism being tested. Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) is a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by antigen-specific, memory T lymphocytes (classically T$_H1$ cells). Upon re-exposure to the specific antigen, these T cells recognize antigen presented on major histocompatibility complex class II, become activated, and secrete cytokines (such as interferon gamma) that recruit and activate macrophages, producing the characteristic indurated, erythematous lesion 48 to 72 hours after antigen challenge.\n\nStep 2: Determine the transferable component of immunity in DTH. Because DTH is cell-mediated and depends on memory T lymphocytes, passive transfer of this sensitivity requires viable, antigen-specific T cells from the sensitized donor. Humoral components (antibodies in serum) do not mediate DTH and therefore cannot transfer this type of sensitivity.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option based on the mechanism.\n- Option A (Serum): Contains antibodies; effective for transferring humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity but not cell-mediated DTH. Not sufficient.\n- Option B (Purified B-lymphocytes): B cells are responsible for antibody production; they do not mediate DTH. Not sufficient.\n- Option C (Purified T-lymphocytes): These are the effector and memory cells responsible for DTH. This population can transfer antigen-specific DTH sensitivity. Sufficient.\n- Option D (Neutrophils): Innate effector cells; not antigen-specific and not responsible for DTH initiation. Not sufficient.\n- Option E (Red blood cells): Non-immune cells; no role in antigen-specific adaptive responses. Not sufficient.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the correct transferable component. Only the purified T-lymphocyte population from the sensitized animal can transfer DTH sensitivity to a naive recipient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2284708"}, {"introduction": "Having established that T cells are the primary mediators of DTH, we can now use more precise tools to dissect their specific roles. This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario using monoclonal antibodies to deplete a specific T cell subset, the CD4$^+$ helper T cells, just before the antigen challenge. This practice will help you differentiate between the sensitization phase (establishing memory) and the effector phase (executing the response), clarifying the critical, real-time function of CD4$^+$ T cells in orchestrating the inflammatory reaction that defines DTH [@problem_id:2284682].", "problem": "An immunologist is studying a classic model of Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) using mice. In the experiment, a group of mice is first sensitized by applying a chemical allergen, dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), to the skin on their abdomen. This initial exposure, known as the sensitization phase, elicits a primary immune response but causes no visible skin reaction. Ten days later, the immunologist initiates the challenge phase. Just one hour before applying a small amount of DNFB to the left ear of a previously sensitized mouse, the researcher injects the mouse with a highly specific monoclonal antibody that binds to the Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) surface molecule, leading to the rapid and effective depletion of all CD4$^+$ T cells from circulation and tissues. The right ear is left untreated as a control. The researcher will measure the ear thickness 24 to 48 hours after the challenge to quantify the inflammatory response.\n\nAssuming the mouse was successfully sensitized and the antibody-mediated depletion was complete, which of the following outcomes is expected for the challenged left ear?\n\nA. The left ear will show a significantly reduced or absent swelling response compared to a sensitized control mouse that did not receive the depleting antibody.\n\nB. The left ear will exhibit a rapid and pronounced swelling accompanied by fluid-filled blisters within 30 minutes of the DNFB application.\n\nC. The depletion of CD4$^+$ T cells will have no effect on the ear swelling, as sensitization has already generated a population of memory cells capable of mounting the response.\n\nD. The inflammatory response will be more intense and rapid, as cytotoxic CD8$^+$ T cells will overcompensate for the absence of CD4$^+$ T cells.\n\nE. The ear will develop signs of immune complex deposition, characterized by vasculitis and hemorrhage, due to a switch from a cell-mediated to an antibody-mediated response.", "solution": "The key immunologic mechanism in a classic Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH; type IV hypersensitivity) response is antigen-specific activation of memory CD4$^+$ T helper 1 cells (T$_H1$) at the challenge site. Upon re-encounter with the hapten-protein complex presented on MHC class II by local antigen-presenting cells, these T$_H1$ cells become reactivated and secrete cytokines such as interferon-$\\gamma$ and tumor necrosis factor-$\\alpha$, which:\n- Upregulate endothelial adhesion molecules to recruit monocytes and other leukocytes,\n- Activate macrophages,\n- Increase vascular permeability and local tissue edema.\n\nThis response characteristically develops over 24 to 48 hours, producing measurable swelling and induration at the challenge site. Thus, the effector phase of DTH is mediated primarily by CD4$^+$ T$_H1$ cells and their cytokines.\n\nIn the described experiment, the mouse was successfully sensitized, establishing hapten-specific memory T cells. However, one hour before challenge, the experimenter depletes all CD4$^+$ T cells. Because the effector arm of classic DTH requires CD4$^+$ T$_H1$ cells at the time of antigen re-exposure, removing these cells immediately prior to challenge abrogates the local cytokine cascade and macrophage recruitment that produce the swelling. Memory that resides in CD4$^+$ cells cannot function if those cells are absent at the time of challenge, and other lymphocyte subsets do not typically compensate to generate a classic DTH response.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: depletion of CD4$^+$ T cells immediately before challenge will significantly reduce or abolish the characteristic 24–48 hour swelling of DTH.\n- B is incorrect: a rapid response within 30 minutes with wheal and blistering is typical of type I (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity, not DTH.\n- C is incorrect: although sensitization generated memory, the effector CD4$^+$ T$_H1$ cells are required at challenge; their depletion prevents the response.\n- D is incorrect: CD8$^+$ T cells do not typically overcompensate to create a more intense and rapid DTH; the classic DTH effector phase depends on CD4$^+$ cells.\n- E is incorrect: immune complex-mediated vasculitis is characteristic of type III hypersensitivity and would not be expected from acute CD4$^+$ T cell depletion in this model.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome for the challenged left ear is a significantly reduced or absent swelling response relative to a sensitized control without CD4$^+$ depletion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2284682"}, {"introduction": "The principles of DTH are not just theoretical; they have profound clinical implications, particularly in diagnostics and managing infectious diseases. This problem moves from experimental models to a critical real-world scenario: administering a tuberculin (PPD) skin test to a patient with advanced HIV and a severely depleted CD4$^+$ T cell count. Solving this requires you to apply your knowledge of the DTH mechanism to predict the test outcome, revealing how an individual's underlying immune status can lead to potentially misleading diagnostic results like anergy [@problem_id:2284725].", "problem": "A 35-year-old patient diagnosed several years ago with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection presents for a routine check-up. The patient's latest laboratory results indicate a Cluster of Differentiation 4 positive (CD4$^+$) T cell count of 120 cells per microliter (cells/μL). As part of a comprehensive screening for opportunistic infections, the physician administers a Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) skin test. This test, used to screen for exposure to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, involves the intradermal injection of bacterial antigens. A positive result classically manifests as a firm, swollen, and reddened area (induration) at the injection site, peaking 48 to 72 hours after injection. This visible reaction is the hallmark of a cell-mediated immune response known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH).\n\nAssuming the patient was exposed to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* in the past and would have tested positive before their CD4$^+$ T cell count became severely depleted, which of the following describes the most likely outcome of the PPD test now and the correct immunological reason for it?\n\nA. An immediate and widespread hive-like rash, due to the mass degranulation of mast cells sensitized with PPD-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE).\n\nB. A strong positive reaction with significant induration, because memory B cells will rapidly produce high-affinity antibodies against the PPD antigens.\n\nC. A negative or very weak reaction, because the depletion of CD4$^+$ T helper cells compromises the activation and recruitment of macrophages necessary to form the inflammatory lesion.\n\nD. A delayed but extremely strong positive reaction, because the lack of regulatory T cells results in an uncontrolled inflammatory response led by cytotoxic CD8$^+$ T cells.", "solution": "The purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test elicits a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, which is a type IV hypersensitivity response. The mechanism requires prior sensitization to mycobacterial antigens and depends on memory CD4$^+$ T helper 1 (T$_H1$) cells recognizing PPD-derived peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex class II by local antigen-presenting cells. Upon re-exposure, these T$_H1$ cells secrete cytokines such as interferon-$\\gamma$ and interleukin-2, which activate and recruit macrophages and other inflammatory cells to the site, producing the characteristic induration and erythema that peak at 48 to 72 hours.\n\nIn advanced HIV infection with a CD4$^+$ T cell count of approximately 120 cells per microliter, there is marked depletion of CD4$^+$ T helper cells, including the memory T$_H1$ subset that mediates DTH. This depletion compromises cytokine production and macrophage activation and recruitment at the test site. As a result, individuals who would previously have mounted a positive DTH response can become anergic, yielding a negative or very weak PPD reaction despite prior exposure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes an immediate, type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE and mast cell degranulation, which is not the mechanism of the PPD test. Option B is incorrect because humoral immunity and memory B cell antibody production do not mediate the PPD induration; antibodies are not responsible for the DTH lesion. Option D is incorrect because the PPD response is not driven by cytotoxic CD8$^+$ T cells, and HIV-induced immunodeficiency does not cause an exaggerated DTH response; rather, it blunts the response due to loss of CD4$^+$ T$_H1$ function.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a negative or very weak reaction due to impaired CD4$^+$ T helper cell–mediated activation and recruitment of macrophages necessary for the DTH induration, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2284725"}]}
