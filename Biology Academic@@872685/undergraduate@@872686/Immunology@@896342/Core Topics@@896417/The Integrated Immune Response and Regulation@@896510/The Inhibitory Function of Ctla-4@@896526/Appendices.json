This exercise [@problem_id:2276941] presents a thought experiment involving a genetic defect that prevents the CTLA-4 protein from being transported to the T cell surface. By analyzing this scenario, you can solidify your understanding of CTLA-4's essential role as a surface-expressed 'brake' on T cell activation.", "problem": "T cell activation is a cornerstone of the adaptive immune response, requiring two distinct signals delivered by an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 1 is initiated when the T Cell Receptor (TCR) on a T cell recognizes a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on the APC. Signal 2, a crucial co-stimulatory signal, is primarily delivered through the binding of the CD28 protein on the T cell surface to its ligands, B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 (CD86), on the APC.\n\nTo prevent autoimmunity and maintain homeostasis, T cell responses are tightly controlled by inhibitory mechanisms. One of the most important regulators is the Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). In a resting T cell, CTLA-4 is stored within intracellular vesicles. Following the initial activation of the T cell, these vesicles are mobilized, and CTLA-4 is expressed on the cell surface. On the surface, CTLA-4 competes with CD28 to bind the same B7 ligands on the APC, but it does so with a much higher affinity.\n\nImagine a patient with a specific genetic defect. This defect results in a mutation in the gene encoding the CTLA-4 protein. The mutation does not affect the B7-binding portion of the protein, nor its overall synthesis. However, it completely disrupts the protein's trafficking signal, making it impossible for CTLA-4 to be transported from the intracellular vesicles to the T cell's plasma membrane following activation. Assume all other proteins involved in T cell activation and regulation function normally.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected consequence for this patient's T cells when they encounter an APC presenting a specific antigen?\n\nA. T cells would fail to become activated, as CTLA-4 is an essential positive co-stimulatory molecule required for T cell activation.\n\nB. T cells would exhibit an exaggerated and prolonged state of activation and proliferation.\n\nC. T cell activation would proceed normally and terminate after the usual duration, as CTLA-4's inhibitory function is redundant and can be fully compensated for by other regulatory molecules.\n\nD. T cells would activate initially but would then immediately undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) because CTLA-4 provides a critical survival signal.\n\nE. T cells would become anergic (unresponsive) because the absence of CTLA-4 from the cell surface disrupts the formation of a stable immunological synapse.", "solution": "T cell activation requires two signals delivered by an antigen-presenting cell: Signal 1 through TCR recognition of peptide-MHC and Signal 2 through co-stimulation, primarily CD28 binding to B7-1/B7-2. In a normal response, initial activation induces CTLA-4 expression at the cell surface by mobilizing intracellular vesicles; CTLA-4 then competes with CD28 for B7 with higher affinity and delivers inhibitory signals that reduce IL-2 production, limit proliferation, and help terminate the response.\n\nIn the described mutation, CTLA-4 synthesis and B7-binding domain are intact, but the trafficking signal is disabled, so CTLA-4 cannot reach the plasma membrane after activation. Consequently:\n- The initial activation proceeds normally because Signal 1 (TCR-peptide-MHC) and Signal 2 (CD28-B7) are intact, and CTLA-4 is not required for activation.\n- The normal inhibitory checkpoint provided by CTLA-4 at the cell surface is absent, since CTLA-4 cannot compete with CD28 for B7 nor deliver inhibitory signaling.\n- Without CTLA-4-mediated inhibition, CD28 signaling persists more strongly and for longer, leading to increased IL-2 production, augmented proliferation, and delayed termination of the response.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because CTLA-4 is not a positive co-stimulator; it is inhibitory.\n- Option C is incorrect because CTLA-4 function is not redundant; its loss causes marked hyperactivation (as evidenced by CTLA-4 deficiency phenotypes).\n- Option D is incorrect because CTLA-4 does not provide a critical survival signal; its absence does not trigger immediate apoptosis.\n- Option E is incorrect because anergy results from absent co-stimulation (e.g., lack of CD28-B7), not from absence of CTLA-4; the immunological synapse can still form via TCR and CD28.\n\nThe most accurate consequence is exaggerated and prolonged T cell activation and proliferation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2276941"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the regulation of a single T cell, this practice problem [@problem_id:2276926] examines how CTLA-4 functions at a population level to maintain immune tolerance.
