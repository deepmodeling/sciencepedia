Like many proteins that span the cell membrane and interact with the outside world, the TCR is composed of distinct domains, each with a specialized function. This first exercise challenges you to connect the fundamental properties of protein segments—such as sequence variability and hydrophobicity—to their roles as variable, constant, or transmembrane domains, a core skill in molecular immunology [@problem_id:2279615].", "problem": "The T-cell Receptor (TCR) is a protein complex found on the surface of T-lymphocytes that is responsible for recognizing fragments of antigens as peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. A typical TCR is composed of two different protein chains. The TCR β chain is a single polypeptide that can be conceptually divided into sequential regions based on their structure and function, starting from the N-terminus (extracellular) and proceeding to the C-terminus (intracellular).\n\nConsider a simplified description of a TCR β chain divided into three primary segments:\n\n*   **Segment I:** The N-terminal segment, approximately 110-120 amino acids long. The amino acid sequence in this segment exhibits immense variation when comparing TCRs from different T-cell clones. This region is primarily responsible for antigen recognition.\n*   **Segment II:** Following Segment I, this segment is approximately 140-150 amino acids long. Its amino acid sequence is largely conserved across TCRs from different T-cells and shares structural homology with immunoglobulin constant domains.\n*   **Segment III:** A short segment of about 25 amino acids that follows Segment II. This segment is characterized by a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids, allowing it to be stably embedded within the cell's plasma membrane.\n\nBased on these functional and structural descriptions, which of the following options correctly identifies Segment I, Segment II, and Segment III?\n\nA. Segment I: Constant domain, Segment II: Variable domain, Segment III: Transmembrane region\n\nB. Segment I: Variable domain, Segment II: Constant domain, Segment III: Transmembrane region\n\nC. Segment I: Transmembrane region, Segment II: Constant domain, Segment III: Variable domain\n\nD. Segment I: Variable domain, Segment II: Transmembrane region, Segment III: Constant domain", "solution": "We are given three sequential segments of a TCR β chain from the N-terminus to the C-terminus with defining features.\n\nFirst, interpret Segment I: It is N-terminal, extracellular, approximately 110–120 amino acids, with immense sequence variation and responsible for antigen recognition. These are defining characteristics of the variable domain of the TCR, which contains the complementarity-determining regions that contact peptide–MHC. Therefore, Segment I corresponds to the variable domain.\n\nSecond, interpret Segment II: It follows Segment I, is approximately 140–150 amino acids long, largely conserved across different TCRs, and has structural homology to immunoglobulin constant domains. These features define the constant domain of the TCR β chain. Therefore, Segment II corresponds to the constant domain.\n\nThird, interpret Segment III: It is a short segment of about 25 amino acids, highly hydrophobic, and is embedded in the plasma membrane. These features define a transmembrane region. Therefore, Segment III corresponds to the transmembrane region.\n\nMatching these identifications to the options:\n- Segment I: Variable domain\n- Segment II: Constant domain\n- Segment III: Transmembrane region\n\nThis corresponds to option B and rules out the others by mismatch of features and lengths (for instance, the transmembrane region cannot be 140–150 amino acids, nor can the highly variable antigen-recognition region be constant).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2279615"}, {"introduction": "Having identified the basic domains of a TCR chain, we now explore how the complete receptor is assembled. The stability of the αβ TCR heterodimer is not just a matter of non-covalent interactions; a specific covalent bond plays a crucial role. This thought experiment asks you to predict the functional outcome of a targeted mutation that prevents this bond from forming, demonstrating the importance of structural integrity for proper protein assembly and expression on the cell surface [@problem_id:2279575].", "problem": "The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a protein complex found on the surface of T lymphocytes that is responsible for recognizing foreign antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. The most common type of TCR is composed of two different protein chains, an alpha (α) chain and a beta (β) chain, which form a heterodimer. Each chain consists of a variable region, a constant region, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular constant domains of the α and β chains are connected by a single, highly conserved interchain disulfide bond, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the receptor. This bond forms between a specific cysteine residue in the Cα domain and a corresponding cysteine residue in the Cβ domain.\n\nConsider a scenario in which a genetic engineering experiment introduces a point mutation into the gene encoding the TCR α-chain in a line of T-cells. This mutation specifically alters the codon for the conserved cysteine residue involved in the interchain disulfide bond, causing it to be translated as a serine residue instead. Assume all other components of the T-cell, including the TCR β-chain and the associated CD3 signaling complex, are normal.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most likely primary consequence of this cysteine-to-serine mutation on the αβ TCR complex?\n\nA. The α and β chains will fail to form a stable, covalently-linked heterodimer, leading to impaired surface expression of the TCR complex.\n\nB. The mutation will significantly increase the affinity of the TCR for its peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligand, leading to T-cell hyperactivation.\n\nC. The TCR will assemble correctly on the cell surface, but will be unable to transmit an activation signal upon pMHC binding due to a disrupted interaction with the CD3 complex.\n\nD. The mutated α-chain will now preferentially pair with a γ-chain instead of a β-chain, resulting in the expression of a non-functional αγ T-cell receptor on the cell surface.\n\nE. The mutation will have no significant effect on TCR assembly or function, as the non-covalent interactions between the α and β chains are sufficient for stable dimerization and surface expression.", "solution": "- Principle of disulfide bond formation: Interchain disulfide bonds in proteins form by oxidation of sulfhydryl groups on two cysteine residues, yielding a covalent linkage that stabilizes quaternary structure. A cysteine-to-serine substitution removes the thiol group and thus eliminates the capacity to form a disulfide bond; serine’s hydroxyl cannot participate in disulfide bond formation.\n\n- Structural context in the TCR: The $\\alpha\\beta$ TCR heterodimer has a conserved interchain disulfide bond between specific cysteines in the constant domains $\\text{C}\\alpha$ and $\\text{C}\\beta$. This bond is highly conserved and is important for the structural integrity and stability of the heterodimer.\n\n- Consequence of the mutation: Substituting the conserved cysteine in the $\\alpha$-chain with serine prevents formation of the interchain disulfide. As a result, the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ chains can no longer be covalently linked. While non-covalent interactions between the chains exist, the absence of the conserved disulfide generally reduces dimer stability and impairs proper assembly.\n\n- Cellular quality control and surface expression: In the endoplasmic reticulum, proper folding and correct interchain disulfide bonding are part of quality control checkpoints. Failure to establish required disulfide bonds typically leads to retention, misassembly, and degradation, thereby reducing successful assembly with CD3 and impairing export to the cell surface. Thus, the primary and earliest effect is impaired formation of a stable, covalently linked $\\alpha\\beta$ heterodimer and reduced surface expression of the TCR complex.\n\n- Elimination of alternatives:\n  - B is incorrect because the mutation occurs in the constant domain, not in the antigen-binding variable domains, and loss of a stabilizing covalent bond would not increase affinity; it would more likely reduce stability and expression.\n  - C is unlikely as the primary effect because signaling defects presuppose proper assembly and surface expression; the main blockade occurs earlier at assembly/trafficking.\n  - D is incorrect because pairing specificity of $\\alpha$ with $\\beta$ versus $\\gamma$ with $\\delta$ is developmentally and structurally constrained; the mutation does not redirect pairing to $\\gamma$.\n  - E is incorrect because the conserved disulfide is functionally important for stable assembly; non-covalent interactions alone are insufficient to ensure normal stability and surface expression.\n\nTherefore, the most likely primary consequence is failure to form a stable, covalently linked heterodimer with impaired surface expression of the TCR complex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2279575"}, {"introduction": "We now shift from structure and assembly to quantitative function, comparing the binding behaviors of αβ and γδ TCRs.
