This first practice problem examines the top of the signaling cascade, focusing on the role of the crucial kinase Lck [@problem_id:2277767]. By considering a scenario where Lck is inhibited, you can test your understanding of the dependencies that govern the phosphorylation of downstream components like LAT and SLP-76.", "problem": "In a cellular immunology experiment, a population of primary human T-cells is treated with a highly specific, cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor that completely blocks the kinase activity of Lck. Following this pre-treatment, the T-cells are stimulated by co-culturing them with antigen-presenting cells displaying the appropriate peptide-MHC complex, leading to the engagement of the T-cell Receptor (TCR). The TCR complex contains critical signaling components, including the adaptor proteins Linker for Activation of T-cells (LAT) and SH2-domain-containing Leukocyte Protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), which must be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues to propagate the activation signal.\n\nGiven this scenario where TCR engagement occurs in the presence of a potent Lck inhibitor, what is the expected phosphorylation status of LAT and SLP-76?\n\nA. Both LAT and SLP-76 would be phosphorylated.\n\nB. LAT would be phosphorylated, but SLP-76 would not be.\n\nC. SLP-76 would be phosphorylated, but LAT would not be.\n\nD. Neither LAT nor SLP-76 would be phosphorylated.\n\nE. Both LAT and SLP-76 would become dephosphorylated below their basal state.", "solution": "The proximal T-cell receptor signaling cascade proceeds in a defined order that depends critically on the kinase activity of Lck. The essential steps are as follows.\n\n1) Upon TCR engagement with peptide-MHC, the Src-family kinase Lck phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3 chains. This phosphorylation creates binding sites for the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70.\n\n2) ZAP-70 is recruited to phosphorylated ITAMs and requires phosphorylation by Lck (and subsequent autophosphorylation steps) to become catalytically active.\n\n3) Active ZAP-70 phosphorylates the adaptor proteins LAT and SLP-76 on specific tyrosine residues. Phosphorylated LAT forms a scaffold that recruits Gads and SLP-76, facilitating downstream signaling.\n\nGiven a complete pharmacologic blockade of Lck kinase activity before and during TCR engagement, step 1 fails: ITAMs are not phosphorylated. Consequently, ZAP-70 cannot be effectively recruited and activated (step 2), which prevents the phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76 (step 3). Therefore, in the stimulated condition, neither LAT nor SLP-76 becomes phosphorylated.\n\nRegarding basal phosphorylation, option E posits a decrease below basal levels. Basal phosphorylation of these adaptors is maintained by a balance of kinases and phosphatases; removing Lck input prevents stimulus-induced increases but does not imply an active decrease below basal beyond ongoing phosphatase activity. The key experimental expectation under stimulation with Lck fully inhibited is the absence of inducible phosphorylation of both LAT and SLP-76.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that neither LAT nor SLP-76 would be phosphorylated upon TCR engagement when Lck is inhibited.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2277767"}, {"introduction": "Effective signaling requires not only the right proteins but also their assembly at the right place and time. This thought experiment explores the critical importance of spatial organization by considering the consequences of mislocalizing the SLP-76 adapter protein away from the plasma membrane [@problem_id:2277720]. This will challenge you to think about the signalosome as a physical structure and why proximity is key to its function.", "problem": "The activation of a T-cell is a tightly regulated process initiated by the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) complex. Upon engagement with an antigen-presenting cell, the kinase Lck phosphorylates the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs) within the CD3 components of the TCR complex. This creates docking sites for the kinase ZAP-70, which is subsequently phosphorylated and activated by Lck. A key event downstream of ZAP-70 activation is the formation of a critical signaling complex, often called a signalosome. Activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates two crucial adapter proteins: Linker for Activation of T-cells (LAT), a transmembrane protein, and SH2 domain-containing Leukocyte Protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), a cytosolic protein. In a normal T-cell, phosphorylated LAT acts as a master scaffold at the plasma membrane, recruiting a multi-protein complex that includes SLP-76. This LAT-SLP-76 microcluster is essential for bringing downstream enzymes, such as Phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLCγ1), into proximity with their activators and substrates, ultimately leading to calcium flux and activation of transcription factors.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a bioengineering experiment has been performed on a line of T-cells. The gene for SLP-76 has been modified to include a potent mitochondrial targeting sequence, causing virtually all newly synthesized SLP-76 protein to be exclusively localized within the mitochondria, physically separated from the plasma membrane. These modified T-cells are then stimulated through their TCR. Which of the following statements describes the most direct and certain consequence of sequestering SLP-76 in the mitochondria?\n\nA. ZAP-70 will be unable to bind to the phosphorylated ITAMs of the CD3 complex.\n\nB. The transmembrane adapter protein LAT will not be phosphorylated following TCR stimulation.\n\nC. The expression of the high-affinity Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor will be unaffected, as this process is independent of SLP-76.\n\nD. A robust and sustained flux of intracellular calcium, mediated by IP3, will still occur, but downstream MAPK pathway activation will be blocked.\n\nE. PLCγ1 will not be efficiently activated, leading to a profound defect in the generation of inositol trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and subsequent calcium mobilization.", "solution": "- TCR engagement normally initiates the following ordered steps: (i) Lck phosphorylates CD3 ITAMs, creating binding sites for ZAP-70; (ii) ZAP-70 binds phosphorylated ITAMs via its SH2 domains and is phosphorylated and activated by Lck; (iii) active ZAP-70 phosphorylates LAT at multiple tyrosines and also phosphorylates SLP-76; (iv) phosphorylated LAT nucleates a membrane-proximal signalosome by recruiting adapters and enzymes (for example, Gads, Grb2, PLCγ1). Gads constitutively binds SLP-76, thereby coupling SLP-76 to LAT; (v) within the LAT–SLP-76 complex, SLP-76 serves as an essential scaffold that recruits and positions Tec-family kinase Itk and PLCγ1, enabling Itk-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ1; (vi) activated PLCγ1 hydrolyzes PIP2 to generate DAG and IP3; IP3 triggers endoplasmic reticulum calcium release, producing the calcium flux required for NFAT activation, while DAG supports PKC-theta and RasGRP signaling (NF-kB and MAPK).\n\n- In the engineered cells, SLP-76 is sequestered in mitochondria and therefore cannot be recruited to LAT microclusters at the plasma membrane. Immediate consequences follow from pathway topology:\n  1. Steps upstream of SLP-76 are preserved: Lck phosphorylation of ITAMs and ZAP-70 binding to ITAMs do not require SLP-76. Therefore, ZAP-70 still binds CD3 ITAMs, contradicting option A.\n  2. ZAP-70 phosphorylation of LAT occurs at the membrane independent of SLP-76 localization, so LAT phosphorylation still occurs, contradicting option B.\n  3. Assembly of the LAT–SLP-76 complex fails because SLP-76 is absent from the membrane. As a result, recruitment and proper positioning of Itk and PLCγ1 within the signalosome are defective, and PLCγ1 activation is inefficient. Consequently, PIP2 hydrolysis to IP3 and DAG is markedly reduced, leading to a profound defect in IP3 production and calcium mobilization. This directly supports option E.\n  4. Because calcium/NFAT and DAG-dependent pathways jointly drive IL-2 and CD25 expression, the process is not independent of SLP-76; option C is incorrect.\n  5. Robust calcium flux requires PLCγ1-derived IP3; with PLCγ1 activation impaired, robust sustained calcium flux will not occur. Moreover, MAPK signaling may still be partially supported by LAT–Grb2–SOS, so the assertion in option D (calcium intact but MAPK blocked) is reversed and therefore incorrect.\n\n- Therefore, the most direct and certain consequence of sequestering SLP-76 away from the LAT microclusters is failure to efficiently activate PLCγ1, with a consequent profound reduction in IP3 generation and calcium mobilization.\n\n- The correct choice is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2277720"}, {"introduction": "Scaffold proteins like LAT are master organizers, launching multiple signaling pathways simultaneously. This advanced problem delves into the specifics of LAT's function by using a hypothetical mutant that selectively disables most of its docking sites [@problem_id:2277785]. Analyzing this scenario will deepen your understanding of how LAT coordinates distinct downstream events, such as calcium mobilization and MAPK pathway activation.", "problem": "A research team is investigating signal transduction pathways in a genetically engineered T-cell line. This cell line expresses a mutant form of the Linker for Activation of T-cells (LAT) protein. In this specific mutant, the tyrosine residue at position 132 (Y132), which serves as the docking site for the SH2 domain of Phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLCγ1), is intact. However, all other key tyrosine residues on LAT, which are normally phosphorylated upon T-cell activation to recruit other adapter proteins like Grb2 and Gads, have been mutated to phenylalanine. Phenylalanine cannot be phosphorylated, effectively ablating these other docking sites. All other signaling components, including the T-Cell Receptor (TCR), ZAP-70, and SLP-76, are present and functional.\n\nUpon stimulation of the TCR in these mutant T-cells, which of the following statements provides the most accurate prediction of the downstream signaling events compared to wild-type T-cells?\n\nA. The cells will exhibit robust calcium flux and full activation of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, indistinguishable from wild-type cells.\n\nB. PLCγ1 will be recruited to the plasma membrane, but its activation will be severely impaired, leading to attenuated calcium flux and abrogation of the MAPK pathway.\n\nC. The cells will fail to recruit PLCγ1 to the plasma membrane, resulting in a complete absence of calcium flux, while the MAPK pathway proceeds normally.\n\nD. The recruitment of both the Grb2-Sos complex and the Gads-SLP-76 complex to LAT will occur normally, but the activation of PLCγ1 will be specifically blocked.\n\nE. Signaling will be hyperactivated through the PLCγ1 pathway due to the lack of competition from other signaling molecules for binding to LAT.", "solution": "T-cell receptor engagement leads to activation of the Src-family kinases and ZAP-70, which phosphorylates LAT on multiple tyrosine residues. In wild-type cells, distinct LAT phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for different SH2-containing proteins: Y132 (human numbering) recruits PLCγ1 via its SH2 domain, while other key LAT tyrosines recruit the adapter proteins Grb2 (which brings Sos to activate Ras and the MAPK pathway) and Gads (which recruits SLP-76). SLP-76, in turn, scaffolds Tec-family kinases such as Itk that phosphorylate and activate PLCγ1, enabling robust phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium signaling.\n\nIn the engineered mutant described, Y132 is intact, so upon TCR stimulation ZAP-70 can still phosphorylate LAT Y132 and thereby recruit PLCγ1 to the membrane via SH2-pY132 binding. However, because all other key LAT tyrosines are mutated to phenylalanine, LAT cannot be phosphorylated at those positions and thus cannot recruit Grb2 or Gads. Consequently:\n1) The Grb2-Sos complex fails to localize to LAT, preventing efficient Ras activation and thereby abrogating the MAPK cascade relative to wild-type.\n2) The Gads-SLP-76 complex also fails to be recruited to LAT. Although SLP-76 is present, its LAT-dependent microcluster assembly is impaired. This compromises the recruitment and activation of Itk, which is necessary for PLCγ1 phosphorylation on its activation tyrosine and full catalytic activation. Therefore, despite PLCγ1 membrane recruitment via pY132, its activation is severely impaired, leading to attenuated inositol phosphate production and reduced calcium flux compared to wild-type.\n\nThese mechanistic consequences rule out the alternatives: PLCγ1 recruitment is not abolished (contradicting C), Grb2/Gads recruitment is not normal (contradicting D), signaling is not hyperactivated (contradicting E), and neither calcium flux nor MAPK signaling is robust as in wild-type (contradicting A). The most accurate prediction is that PLCγ1 is recruited but poorly activated, calcium signaling is attenuated, and the MAPK pathway is abrogated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2277785"}]}
