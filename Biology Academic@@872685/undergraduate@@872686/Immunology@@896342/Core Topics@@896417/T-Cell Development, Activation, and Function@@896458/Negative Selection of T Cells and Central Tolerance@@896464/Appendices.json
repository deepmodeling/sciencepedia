Before a T cell is tested for dangerous self-reactivity (negative selection), it must first prove its utility by demonstrating it can recognize the body's own MHC molecules (positive selection). This exercise [@problem_id:2253623] clarifies the crucial difference between active deletion due to high affinity for self and \"death by neglect\" due to a lack of any useful recognition, which is a failure of positive selection.", "problem": "During their development in the thymus, immature T cells, called thymocytes, undergo a critical two-step selection process to ensure they can function correctly without causing autoimmune disease. This process hinges on the interaction between the T-cell Receptor (TCR) on the thymocyte and self-peptide antigens presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules by thymic cells.\n\nThe first step, **positive selection**, tests whether a thymocyte's TCR can recognize the body's own MHC molecules. A low to moderate affinity interaction provides a survival signal, allowing the cell to proceed. Cells whose TCRs cannot bind to any self-MHC complexes fail to receive this signal.\n\nThe second step, **negative selection**, tests for self-reactivity. Thymocytes that survive positive selection are checked for how strongly they bind to self-peptide:MHC complexes. Those that bind with high affinity are considered dangerously auto-reactive and are eliminated.\n\nConsider a thymocyte with a newly generated TCR that, due to its unique structure, is completely unable to bind to any self-peptide:MHC complex it encounters in the thymus. Which of the following describes the most likely fate of this particular thymocyte?\n\nA. The cell is eliminated via apoptosis during negative selection because it is non-reactive to self-antigens.\n\nB. The cell fails to be positively selected and is eliminated via apoptosis, a process known as \"death by neglect.\"\n\nC. The cell successfully completes maturation, becomes a naive T cell, and is exported to the periphery.\n\nD. The cell survives and differentiates into a regulatory T cell (Treg) that will later suppress autoimmune reactions.\n\nE. The cell becomes functionally unresponsive, a state known as anergy, and circulates in the periphery without effect.", "solution": "Positive selection occurs first in the thymic cortex and requires that a thymocyte’s TCR engage self-peptide:MHC with low to moderate affinity to receive a survival signal. Without any detectable binding to self-MHC, the thymocyte does not receive this survival signal and undergoes apoptosis, a process termed death by neglect. Negative selection, which occurs later (primarily in the medulla), eliminates thymocytes that bind self-peptide:MHC with high affinity; it cannot apply to a cell that never engages self-MHC in the first place. Regulatory T cell differentiation typically arises from thymocytes with relatively stronger self-reactivity that is below the threshold for deletion, not from cells that fail to recognize self-MHC at all. Anergy is a peripheral tolerance mechanism requiring survival to the periphery and antigen encounter without appropriate co-stimulation, which does not occur for cells that fail positive selection. Therefore, the thymocyte completely unable to bind any self-peptide:MHC fails positive selection and is eliminated by death by neglect.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A: Incorrect—negative selection removes high-affinity self-reactive cells, not non-reactive cells.\n- B: Correct—failure to receive positive selection signals leads to apoptosis (death by neglect).\n- C: Incorrect—maturation requires successful positive selection.\n- D: Incorrect—Treg selection requires some self-reactivity, not absence of recognition.\n- E: Incorrect—anergy is a peripheral state; this cell never exits the thymus.\n\nThus, the most likely fate is death by neglect due to failure of positive selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2253623"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic selection principles, we now explore how the immune system solves a major challenge: tolerizing T cells to antigens found only in peripheral organs without the T cells ever leaving the thymus. This practice [@problem_id:2253589] examines the critical role of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and the molecular machinery, like the TAP protein, they use to present these tissue-specific antigens. By analyzing a hypothetical genetic defect, you will connect a specific molecular failure to the potential onset of organ-specific autoimmune diseases.", "problem": "The establishment of central tolerance within the thymus is a critical process for preventing autoimmunity. This process involves the elimination, or negative selection, of developing T cells (thymocytes) that bind with high affinity to self-antigens. A key cell type involved in this is the medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC), which expresses a wide variety of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs) that are normally found only in peripheral organs. This is regulated by the Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) protein.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder where the gene encoding the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing 1 (TAP1) is non-functional, but this defect is exclusively manifested in mTECs due to a tissue-specific promoter mutation. In all other cell types, including cortical thymic epithelial cells and dendritic cells, TAP1 functions normally. The TAP1 protein is essential for loading endogenous peptides onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules for presentation on the cell surface.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most direct and significant consequence of this specific genetic defect for the patient's T-cell repertoire?\n\nA. A complete failure to generate any mature, peripheral $CD8^{+}$ T cells due to a defect in positive selection.\n\nB.

The maturation of $CD8^{+}$ T cells that can only recognize viral antigens but not self-antigens expressed by ubiquitous \"housekeeping\" proteins.\n\nE. A compensatory increase in the number and function of regulatory T cells to suppress the uncontrolled T-cell activation.", "solution": "Principles:\n- Positive selection of $CD8^{+}$ T cells occurs on cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) via MHC class I presenting self-peptides; this requires TAP in cTECs.\n- Negative selection (central tolerance) for $CD8^{+}$ T cells to tissue-specific antigens (TSAs) is mediated largely in the thymic medulla by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) that express TSAs under AIRE and present them on MHC class I; this requires TAP in mTECs for endogenous peptide loading.\n- Dendritic cells (DCs) in the thymus can acquire antigens from mTECs and cross-present them via MHC class I; this requires TAP in DCs, not in mTECs, and can partially compensate for mTEC presentation but is not universally sufficient for all TSAs.\n\nGiven defect:\n- TAP1 is non-functional exclusively in mTECs; TAP1 is intact in cTECs, DCs, and all peripheral cells.\n\nDeductions:\n1) Positive selection of $CD8^{+}$ T cells is intact because cTECs have functional TAP1 and can load peptides onto MHC class I. Therefore, a complete failure to generate mature $CD8^{+}$ T cells does not occur, excluding option A.\n2) Peripheral antiviral responses by $CD8^{+}$ T cells depend on TAP in infected peripheral cells and professional APCs; since TAP1 is intact outside mTECs, global $CD8^{+}$ functional deficiency does not occur, excluding option C.\n3) The critical defect is in negative selection of $CD8^{+}$ T cells to TSAs: mTECs cannot load their endogenous TSA-derived peptides onto MHC class I without TAP1, reducing or abrogating direct presentation of TSAs to developing $CD8^{+}$ thymocytes. Although thymic DCs with intact TAP1 can cross-present some mTEC-derived TSAs, cross-presentation is incomplete for the full TSA repertoire; thus, negative selection against certain TSA-specific $CD8^{+}$ clonotypes fails. This leads to survival and export of autoreactive $CD8^{+}$ T cells targeting peripheral TSAs, predisposing to organ-specific autoimmunity. This supports option B as the most direct and significant outcome.\n4) Option D is incorrect because the defect does not selectively affect recognition of viral versus ubiquitous self-antigens; rather, it impairs deletion of TSA-specific clones in the medulla.\n5) Option E is not the most direct consequence; while mTEC/AIRE defects can influence Treg biology (more classically in the CD4 compartment), the primary and most direct CD8 effect here is impaired deletion of TSA-specific clones.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and significant consequence is the survival and maturation of autoreactive $CD8^{+}$ T cells specific for TSAs, with elevated risk for organ-specific autoimmunity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2253589"}, {"introduction": "Our understanding of tolerance is deepened when we move from simple qualitative rules to a quantitative perspective. The fate of a thymocyte is determined by the strength of the signal it receives, which is critically dependent on the concentration of self-antigen presented to it. This final practice [@problem_id:2253611] employs a mathematical model to demonstrate how a significant reduction in self-antigen expression can dramatically increase the probability of an autoreactive T cell escaping deletion, illustrating the dose-dependent nature of central tolerance.", "problem": "Central tolerance is a critical immunological process that prevents autoimmunity by eliminating self-reactive T cells in the thymus. A key mechanism is negative selection, where developing T cells (thymocytes) that bind too strongly to self-antigens are induced to undergo apoptosis. This process occurs in the thymic medulla, mediated by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which express a wide array of tissue-specific self-antigens.\n\nThe strength of the signal received by a thymocyte's T-cell receptor (TCR) determines its fate. This signal depends on the avidity of the interaction with self-peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules on mTECs. For a specific high-affinity autoreactive thymocyte population, the probability of it being deleted ($P_{del}$) can be modeled as a function of the number of specific self-pMHC complexes, $N$, that it encounters on an mTEC. This relationship is described by the Hill equation:\n\n$$P_{del}(N) = \\frac{N^n}{N_{50}^n + N^n}$$\n\nHere, $N_{50}$ is the number of pMHC complexes required to achieve a 50% deletion probability, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, representing the cooperativity of the signaling pathway.\n\nConsider a specific self-antigen, \"organ-specific protein A\" (OPA), for which a population of high-affinity autoreactive thymocytes exists. In healthy, wild-type individuals, the number of OPA-derived pMHC complexes encountered by a thymocyte, denoted $N_{WT}$, provides a robust signal for negative selection. Assume the signaling is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of $n=2$, and that the wild-type antigen level is high, such that $N_{WT} = 9 N_{50}$.\n\nNow, consider an individual with a genetic disorder affecting a promoter for the OPA gene. This mutation leads to a drastic reduction in its expression within mTECs, such that the number of presented OPA-pMHC complexes, $N_{mut}$, is only 1% of the wild-type level.\n\nCalculate the \"risk amplification factor,\" defined as the ratio of the probability of an autoreactive thymocyte escaping negative selection in the mutant individual ($P_{esc, mut}$) to the probability of escape in a wild-type individual ($P_{esc, WT}$). The escape probability is given by $P_{esc} = 1 - P_{del}$. Round your final answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to calculate the risk amplification factor, which is the ratio $\\frac{P_{esc, mut}}{P_{esc, WT}}$. The escape probability, $P_{esc}$, is defined as $1 - P_{del}$.\n\nFirst, let's express the escape probability, $P_{esc}(N)$, using the given Hill equation for the deletion probability, $P_{del}(N)$.\n$$P_{esc}(N) = 1 - P_{del}(N) = 1 - \\frac{N^n}{N_{50}^n + N^n}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$P_{esc}(N) = \\frac{(N_{50}^n + N^n) - N^n}{N_{50}^n + N^n} = \\frac{N_{50}^n}{N_{50}^n + N^n}$$\nWe are given the Hill coefficient $n=2$. So, the specific formula for escape probability in this system is:\n$$P_{esc}(N) = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + N^2}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the escape probability for a wild-type individual, $P_{esc, WT}$. We are given that the number of pMHC complexes in this case is $N_{WT} = 9 N_{50}$. Substituting this into our escape probability formula:\n$$P_{esc, WT} = P_{esc}(N_{WT}) = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + N_{WT}^2} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + (9 N_{50})^2}$$\n$$P_{esc, WT} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + 81 N_{50}^2} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{82 N_{50}^2} = \\frac{1}{82}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the escape probability for the mutant individual, $P_{esc, mut}$. The problem states that the number of pMHC complexes in the mutant, $N_{mut}$, is 1% of the wild-type level.\n$$N_{mut} = 0.01 \\times N_{WT}$$\nSince $N_{WT} = 9 N_{50}$, we can express $N_{mut}$ in terms of $N_{50}$:\n$$N_{mut} = 0.01 \\times (9 N_{50}) = 0.09 N_{50}$$\nNow we substitute this value of $N_{mut}$ into the escape probability formula:\n$$P_{esc, mut} = P_{esc}(N_{mut}) = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + N_{mut}^2} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + (0.09 N_{50})^2}$$\n$$P_{esc, mut} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{N_{50}^2 + 0.0081 N_{50}^2} = \\frac{N_{50}^2}{1.0081 N_{50}^2} = \\frac{1}{1.0081}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the risk amplification factor by taking the ratio of $P_{esc, mut}$ to $P_{esc, WT}$:\n$$\\text{Risk Amplification Factor} = \\frac{P_{esc, mut}}{P_{esc, WT}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1.0081}}{\\frac{1}{82}} = \\frac{82}{1.0081}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\frac{82}{1.0081} \\approx 81.3411368$$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to two significant figures.\n$$81.3411368 \\approx 81$$\nThus, the compromised expression of the self-antigen leads to an approximately 81-fold increase in the probability that a corresponding autoreactive T cell will escape negative selection and mature, posing a significant risk for autoimmunity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{81}$$", "id": "2253611"}]}
