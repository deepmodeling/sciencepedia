Mastering this sequence is the first step toward understanding how a cell maximizes its chances of producing a functional receptor while ensuring only one type of heavy chain is ultimately expressed.", "problem": "In the bone marrow, a progenitor B-cell (pro-B cell) embarks on the critical process of generating a unique B-cell receptor. This process begins with somatic recombination of the gene segments encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain. This mechanism, known as V(D)J recombination, involves joining one Variable (V), one Diversity (D), and one Joining (J) gene segment. The outcome of this recombination is stochastic and can result in a non-productive rearrangement, where the resulting nucleotide sequence contains a frameshift or a premature stop codon, preventing the translation of a functional heavy chain protein.\n\nConsider a diploid pro-B cell that has just attempted V(D)J recombination for its heavy chain locus on the first of its two homologous chromosomes. This first attempt results in a non-productive sequence. According to the principles of B-cell development and allelic exclusion, what is the immediate subsequent action the cell attempts in order to continue its developmental pathway?\n\nA. The cell immediately initiates the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nB. The cell begins V(D)J recombination of a light chain gene locus.\n\nC. The cell attempts V(D)J recombination of the heavy chain gene locus on its second homologous chromosome.\n\nD. The cell re-initiates the recombination process on the same, first chromosome, using different V, D, and J segments.\n\nE. The cell exits the bone marrow and migrates to a secondary lymphoid organ to await activation signals.", "solution": "The scenario describes a pro-B cell that has undergone V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on one homologous chromosome, yielding a non-productive rearrangement. In B-cell development, heavy chain recombination is attempted first at the pro-B stage, with allelic exclusion ensuring that only one productive heavy chain allele is ultimately expressed. The quality-control checkpoint is mediated by assembly of a pre-B-cell receptor, which requires a productive heavy chain; only then does the cell proceed to light chain recombination.\n\nThe rules governing progression are:\n- If the first heavy chain V(D)J recombination attempt on one allele is non-productive, the cell attempts recombination on the heavy chain locus of the second homologous chromosome.\n- Only if both heavy chain alleles fail to produce a functional rearrangement does the cell undergo apoptosis.\n- Light chain VJ recombination begins only after a productive heavy chain has been made and signals through the pre-B-cell receptor.\n- The programmed sequence is to try the other allele rather than reinitiate recombination on the same allele; heavy chain “editing” on the same allele is not the immediate programmed next step.\n\nApplying these principles:\n- Option A is incorrect because apoptosis is not immediate after a single failed attempt; it follows failure on both alleles.\n- Option B is incorrect because light chain recombination requires prior successful heavy chain expression and pre-BCR signaling.\n- Option C is correct: the cell next attempts V(D)J recombination of the heavy chain locus on the second homologous chromosome.\n- Option D is incorrect because the canonical next step is to attempt the other allele, consistent with allelic exclusion and developmental checkpoints.\n- Option E is incorrect because migration to secondary lymphoid organs occurs after maturation, not at the pro-B stage.\n\nTherefore, the immediate subsequent action is to attempt heavy chain recombination on the second homologous chromosome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2215422"}, {"introduction": "A successful heavy chain rearrangement is a critical milestone, but the cell must have a mechanism to recognize this success, halt further heavy chain gene recombination, and proceed with its development.

These mice carry a targeted mutation in the gene encoding the Immunoglobulin-beta (Igβ, also known as CD79b) protein. The mutation is specifically designed to disrupt the non-covalent interaction between the transmembrane domain of Igβ and the transmembrane domain of a newly synthesized immunoglobulin $\\mu$ heavy chain. All other functions of Igβ, including its association with Igα (CD79a) and its cytoplasmic signaling tail, are intact. Assume this mutation is the only genetic difference between these mice and a wild-type control group.

A severe reduction in the number of mature, circulating B-cells, with a developmental arrest observed at the late pro-B to early pre-B cell transition.\n\nB. A normal number of mature B-cells, but a significant fraction of them are found to express two distinct B-cell receptors (BCRs) on their surface due to a failure in immunoglobulin heavy chain allelic exclusion.\n\nC. An overabundance of pre-B cells that successfully express a μ heavy chain but are unable to initiate light chain gene rearrangement, leading to their accumulation in the bone marrow.\n\nD. A population of mature B-cells that exclusively express immunoglobulin light chains of the λ isotype, with a complete absence of κ light chain expression.\n\nE. Normal B-cell development and mature B-cell numbers, as the surrogate light chain components (VpreB and λ5) can compensate for the defective Igβ signaling.", "solution": "We identify the molecular requirement for pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) assembly and signaling. The pre-BCR consists of a newly rearranged membrane-bound immunoglobulin $\\mu$ heavy chain paired with the surrogate light chain (VpreB and $\\lambda 5$) and the signaling heterodimer Ig$\\alpha$ (CD79a) and Ig$\\beta$ (CD79b). The transmembrane domains of Ig$\\alpha$ and Ig$\\beta$ interact non-covalently with the transmembrane region of the $\\mu$ chain to permit proper assembly, transport to the cell surface, and signal transduction via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of Ig$\\alpha$ and Ig$\\beta$.\n\nGiven the mutation specifically disrupts the non-covalent interaction between the transmembrane domain of Ig$\\beta$ and that of the $\\mu$ heavy chain, while leaving Ig$\\beta$'s association with Ig$\\alpha$ and its cytoplasmic tail intact, the critical question is whether Ig$\\alpha$ alone can compensate to allow pre-BCR assembly and signaling. Empirically and mechanistically, both Ig$\\alpha$ and Ig$\\beta$ are required for efficient association with the heavy chain, surface expression, and signaling; knockout of either Ig$\\alpha$ or Ig$\\beta$ causes a block at the late pro-B to early pre-B transition with a severe reduction in mature B cells. Disruption of the Ig$\\beta$–$\\mu$ chain transmembrane interaction prevents proper incorporation of the Ig$\\alpha$/Ig$\\beta$ heterodimer into the pre-BCR, thereby abrogating pre-BCR surface expression or signaling.\n\nPre-BCR signaling is required to:\n- enforce heavy chain allelic exclusion,\n- drive clonal expansion,\n- promote transition from large cycling pre-B cells to small pre-B cells that initiate light chain rearrangement,\n- provide survival signals.\n\nWithout pre-BCR signaling, cells fail to progress from late pro-B to early pre-B, undergo apoptosis, and do not populate the immature and mature B-cell compartments. Consequently:\n- There will be a severe reduction in mature, circulating B cells in peripheral lymphoid organs.\n- Bone marrow B-cell development will show a block at the late pro-B to early pre-B transition.\n\nThis pattern corresponds to option A. Options B, C, D, and E are inconsistent: B incorrectly predicts normal mature B-cell numbers despite failed allelic exclusion; C predicts accumulation of pre-B cells despite absent survival/proliferation signals; D concerns light chain isotype skewing, which is unrelated to Ig$\\beta$–$\\mu$ association; E incorrectly assumes surrogate light chain can substitute for Ig$\\beta$ function, which it cannot.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2215367"}, {"introduction": "With a functional heavy chain secured and confirmed by the pre-BCR checkpoint, the developing B-cell must produce a light chain to form a complete, surface-bound IgM molecule.

This value arises primarily from the random nature of nucleotide additions/deletions at the joining sites, where only one of three possible reading frames is correct.\n\nBased on this model, calculate the fraction of the initial population of B-cell progenitors that successfully produce a functional $\\lambda$ light chain.
