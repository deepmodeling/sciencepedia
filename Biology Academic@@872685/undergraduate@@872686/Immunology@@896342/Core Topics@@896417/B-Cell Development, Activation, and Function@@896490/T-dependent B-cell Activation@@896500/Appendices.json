Paracortex → Medullary Cords → Primary Follicle → Germinal Center", "solution": "A naive B cell resides in the lymph node cortex within primary follicles, maintained there by CXCL13 produced by follicular dendritic cells and its receptor CXCR5 on B cells. Upon encountering a soluble protein antigen specific for its B-cell receptor, the B cell binds antigen, internalizes it, processes it, and presents peptide via MHC class II. Antigen engagement induces upregulation of CCR7 and retention of CXCR5, causing directed migration toward the T-cell zone (paracortex) at the T–B border in response to CCL19 and CCL21. Therefore, after initial binding in the primary follicle, the next compartment is the paracortex, where the B cell receives cognate help from $CD4^+$ T helper (Tfh) cells via CD40–CD40L and cytokines.\n\nFollowing T-cell help, in a T-dependent response, activated B cells either form an early extrafollicular focus in the medullary cords (short-lived, lower-affinity plasmablasts) or, for the canonical high-affinity, class-switched response specified by interaction with helper T cells, re-enter the follicle to initiate a germinal center reaction. The germinal center forms within a secondary follicle and comprises a dark zone (proliferation and somatic hypermutation mediated by AID) and a light zone (selection on follicular dendritic cell–bound antigen with further Tfh help), leading to affinity maturation and class-switch recombination.\n\nDifferentiated plasma cells then exit the germinal center and migrate to the medullary cords of the lymph node, where they secrete antibody; some later home to the bone marrow as long-lived plasma cells. Thus, the chronological sequence from initial antigen binding through T-dependent activation and differentiation into an antibody-secreting cell is: Primary Follicle → Paracortex → Germinal Center → Medullary Cords.\n\nAmong the given options, this corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2272212"}, {"introduction": "The germinal center is a crucible of evolution where B-cells compete for survival signals, a process that drives affinity maturation. This practice uses a quantitative model to simulate the competition between two B-cell clones with different B-cell Receptor (BCR) affinities. By calculating the outcome of this contest, you will gain a concrete understanding of how higher affinity directly translates into a selective advantage for receiving limited T-cell help [@problem_id:2272233].", "problem": "In the germinal center of a lymph node, a process of selection occurs to favor B cells that can most effectively bind to an invading pathogen. Consider a simplified scenario involving two distinct B-cell clones, Clone H and Clone M, that have been activated by the same antigen. Initially, both clones are present in equal numbers.\n\nThe two clones differ in the affinity of their B-cell Receptor (BCR) for the antigen. The affinity of Clone H's BCR is $K_H = 8.5 \\times 10^7 \\text{ M}^{-1}$, while the affinity of Clone M's BCR is $K_M = 1.2 \\times 10^7 \\text{ M}^{-1}$.\n\nThe process of competition for survival signals can be described by the following model:\n1.  The efficiency with which a single B cell captures antigen, processes it, and presents the resulting peptides on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules is directly proportional to the affinity of its BCR for the antigen.\n2.  The total amount of survival and proliferation signals delivered by T Follicular Helper (TFH) cells is limited. These signals are distributed among the entire population of B cells. The fraction of total signals received by a given clone (e.g., all cells of Clone H) is proportional to the total amount of antigen presented by all cells of that clone.\n3.  The final population size of each clone after one round of selection is directly proportional to the amount of TFH cell signals its population received.\n\nAssuming both clones start with the same number of cells, calculate the ratio of the final population size of Clone H to the final population size of Clone M ($N_{H,final} / N_{M,final}$).

Denote the per-cell efficiency by $a_{i}$ for clone $i \\in \\{H,M\\}$, so $a_{i} \\propto K_{i}$.\n\n2) The total antigen presented by clone $i$ is proportional to the number of its cells times its per-cell efficiency:\n$$\nA_{i} \\propto N_{0,i} a_{i} \\propto N_{0,i} K_{i}.\n$$\n\n3) By statement 2, TFH signals received by clone $i$ are proportional to $A_{i}$, so the ratio of signals is\n$$\n\\frac{S_{H}}{S_{M}} = \\frac{A_{H}}{A_{M}} = \\frac{N_{0,H} K_{H}}{N_{0,M} K_{M}}.\n$$\n\n4) By statement 3, final population is proportional to TFH signals, hence\n$$\n\\frac{N_{H,\\text{final}}}{N_{M,\\text{final}}} = \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{M}} = \\frac{N_{0,H} K_{H}}{N_{0,M} K_{M}}.\n$$\nWith $N_{0,H} = N_{0,M}$, this simplifies to\n$$\n\\frac{N_{H,\\text{final}}}{N_{M,\\text{final}}} = \\frac{K_{H}}{K_{M}}.\n$$\n\nSubstitute the given affinities:\n$$\n\\frac{K_{H}}{K_{M}} = \\frac{8.5 \\times 10^{7}}{1.2 \\times 10^{7}} = \\frac{8.5}{1.2} \\approx 7.0833.\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures gives $7.1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.1}$$", "id": "2272233"}, {"introduction": "A B-cell's fate depends on a crucial partnership with a T-helper cell, a concept known as \"linked recognition.\" This practice presents a fascinating scenario where a B-cell successfully recognizes a pathogen, but the required T-cell help is unavailable due to self-tolerance established in the thymus. Working through this problem highlights how the T-cell repertoire's history dictates the outcome of a B-cell response and underscores the intricate checks and balances within the immune system [@problem_id:2272195].", "problem": "In a healthy individual, T-cell development in the thymus involves a process of negative selection mediated by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). These cells express a wide array of self-proteins to eliminate T-cells that react too strongly to the body's own components. One such self-protein expressed by mTECs is an intracellular protein we will call 'Structurin-Y'.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where this individual is infected by a bacterium, *Pathogenix exemplar*. This bacterium expresses a surface protein called 'Adhesin-Z'. While Adhesin-Z and Structurin-Y are structurally very different proteins, they coincidentally share an identical 15-amino-acid sequence, which we will call 'peptide P'.\n\nA naive B-cell clone in a secondary lymphoid organ of this individual has a B-cell receptor (BCR) that specifically recognizes a unique, three-dimensional epitope on the native, intact Adhesin-Z protein. Following this binding, the B-cell internalizes the entire Adhesin-Z protein, processes it into peptide fragments, and presents these fragments on its Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules. One of the fragments presented is the shared peptide P.

Rapid proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells that secrete high-affinity, isotype-switched antibodies against Adhesin-Z.\n\nB.

Therefore, any $CD4^+$ T cell whose TCR recognizes peptide P from Structurin-Y in the relevant MHC class II context is deleted or diverted to a regulatory fate; in either case, conventional helper T cells specific for peptide P are absent from the peripheral repertoire.\n\n2) Antigen capture and processing by the B cell:\n- A naive B cell with BCR specificity for a conformational epitope on native Adhesin-Z binds that intact protein and internalizes it via receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n- Inside the B cell, Adhesin-Z is processed into linear peptides. These peptides are loaded onto MHC class II and presented at the B-cell surface. By the problem statement, one of the presented peptides is peptide P (identical to the self peptide from Structurin-Y).\n\n3) Requirement for linked T-B collaboration:\n- Effective help for B cells in germinal centers requires cognate interaction with a $CD4^+$ T helper cell whose TCR recognizes a peptide-MHC class II complex on that B cell (linked recognition).\n- Delivery of essential signals (CD40L on T cell engaging CD40 on B cell, along with T cell cytokines) is required for B-cell survival in the germinal center, somatic hypermutation, affinity maturation, and class-switch recombination.\n\n4) Consequence of central tolerance to peptide P:\n- Because peptide P-specific helper T cells were deleted in the thymus, the B cell cannot receive cognate help via P-MHC II presentation.\n- In the scenario as framed, the B cell is presenting peptide P among its MHC class II ligands. Without an available T helper cell whose TCR recognizes one of the presented complexes (here emphasized as peptide P), the B cell fails to obtain the necessary co-stimulatory and survival signals.\n- In germinal centers, B cells that fail to receive adequate T-cell help undergo apoptosis (“death by neglect”), rather than proceeding to isotype switching or differentiating into plasma cells. This is favored over anergy in this acute, GC-seeking context.\n\n5) Exclusion of alternatives:\n- A (rapid proliferation with isotype switching) requires CD40-CD40L and cytokine help from a cognate T helper cell; absent here due to deletion of peptide P-specific T cells.\n- B (affinity maturation without isotype switching) still requires T-cell help for germinal center participation and activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity; without help, neither process proceeds.\n- D (anergy) is more characteristic of chronic antigen encounter without help in non-GC contexts; within germinal centers, lack of help typically leads to apoptosis.\n- E is incorrect: B cells do not “switch” their function to present to an unrelated T-cell subset outside of the linked recognition paradigm; help must come from T cells recognizing peptides derived from the same antigen processed by that B cell.\n\nTherefore, the most likely fate of this B-cell clone is apoptosis due to failure to receive the necessary co-stimulatory and survival signals from T helper cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2272195"}]}
