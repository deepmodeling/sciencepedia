By working through this problem, you will gain insight into the cell's sophisticated quality control mechanisms within the endoplasmic reticulum and understand why the structural integrity of the MHC molecule is a non-negotiable prerequisite for its function.", "problem": "The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecule is crucial for the adaptive immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate virus-infected or cancerous cells. A functional MHC class I molecule, expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells, is a heterodimer consisting of a polymorphic, transmembrane heavy chain (the $\\alpha$ chain) and a smaller, non-polymorphic light chain called $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m). The assembly of this complex begins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).\n\nConsider a special line of human cells that has been genetically engineered to be a null mutant for the gene encoding $\\beta_2$m. These cells are therefore completely incapable of synthesizing the $\\beta_2$m protein. What is the most likely ultimate fate of the newly synthesized MHC class I $\\alpha$ chains in these mutant cells?\n\nA. The $\\alpha$ chains will correctly fold by themselves, bind antigenic peptides, and be expressed as monomers on the cell surface.\nB. The $\\alpha$ chains will remain stably bound to chaperone proteins within the ER lumen, accumulating over time but failing to be transported further.\nC. The $\\alpha$ chains will be identified as improperly folded and targeted for degradation by the proteasome in the cytosol.\nD. The $\\alpha$ chains will bypass the Golgi apparatus and be immediately secreted from the cell as soluble proteins.\nE. The $\\alpha$ chains will be transported from the ER to lysosomes, where they will be degraded by acid hydrolases.", "solution": "MHC class I assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires two subunits: a polymorphic transmembrane heavy chain (the $\\alpha$ chain) and the invariant light chain $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m). Proper folding and exit from the ER depend on formation of the $\\alpha:\\beta_2$m heterodimer and loading of peptide, assisted by ER chaperones (e.g., calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, and tapasin). In cells lacking $\\beta_2$m, newly synthesized MHC class I $\\alpha$ chains cannot form the required heterodimer. As a result, they fail to achieve the native conformation recognized by ER quality control. Initially, these $\\alpha$ chains bind ER chaperones (notably calnexin) in an attempt to fold correctly, but without $\\beta_2$m they remain incompletely folded and cannot proceed to peptide loading or exit the ER. Persistent failure to fold triggers ER-associated degradation (ERAD): the misfolded $\\alpha$ chains are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane to the cytosol, ubiquitinated by ER-resident E3 ligases, and degraded by the cytosolic proteasome. Therefore, while transient ER retention by chaperones occurs, the most likely ultimate fate is proteasomal degradation in the cytosol rather than stable accumulation, secretion, or lysosomal degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2275839"}, {"introduction": "Once a stable MHC class I molecule is assembled, its function is to bind and present a specific peptide. This selection is not random; it is governed by strict rules based on the peptide's sequence, a concept known as a peptide-binding motif. This next practice [@problem_id:2275854] provides a hands-on opportunity to apply these rules, asking you to act like a vaccinologist and predict which viral peptide will bind most strongly to a given MHC allele. Mastering this skill is fundamental to understanding T cell recognition and the principles of rational vaccine design.", "problem": "In the field of immunology, a critical step for a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) to recognize and eliminate a virus-infected cell is the presentation of viral peptides by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules on the cell surface. The binding of a peptide to an MHC molecule is highly specific and is determined by the peptide's amino acid sequence, particularly at 'anchor' positions.\n\nA team of virologists is developing a vaccine against a newly discovered virus. They have focused on a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele, `HLA-A*02:07`, which is a type of MHC class I molecule prevalent in the target population. Through structural analysis, they have determined the peptide-binding motif for `HLA-A*02:07` as follows:\n\n1.  The peptide must be exactly 9 amino acids long (a nonapeptide).\n2.  The amino acid at position 2 (P2) must be a hydrophobic residue, specifically Leucine (L) or Methionine (M). This is the dominant primary anchor.\n3.  The amino acid at position 9 (P9), the C-terminus, must be a small amino acid, specifically Valine (V) or Alanine (A). This is the secondary anchor.\n4.  Binding affinity is drastically reduced if the residue at the dominant P2 anchor does not match the motif, even if the P9 anchor is a perfect fit. A peptide with a correct P2 anchor but an incorrect P9 anchor is considered a weak binder, but is significantly better than one with an incorrect P2 anchor.\n\nThe researchers have identified four potential nonapeptide epitopes from a key viral structural protein. Which of the following peptides is predicted to be the strongest binder to the `HLA-A*02:07` molecule and therefore the most promising candidate for a peptide-based vaccine?\n\nA. Peptide `NLTKFGPSV`\nB. Peptide `SMQDLWNTI`\nC. Peptide `GTEYKRSLV`\nD. Peptide `KLPQEVIGA`", "solution": "We use the stated motif for HLA-A*02:07:\n- Peptide length must be exactly $9$.\n- Dominant anchor at $P2$ must be $L$ or $M$.\n- Secondary anchor at $P9$ must be $V$ or $A$.\n- A mismatch at $P2$ drastically reduces affinity; a correct $P2$ with incorrect $P9$ yields a weak binder; correct $P2$ and $P9$ yields a strong binder.\n\nEvaluate each peptide:\n\nA. NLTKFGPSV\n- Length: $9$.\n- $P2 = L$ (matches dominant anchor).\n- $P9 = V$ (matches secondary anchor).\n- Prediction: strong binder (both anchors correct).\n\nB. SMQDLWNTI\n- Length: $9$.\n- $P2 = M$ (matches dominant anchor).\n- $P9 = I$ (does not match $V$ or $A$).\n- Prediction: weak binder (correct $P2$, incorrect $P9$), but inferior to peptides with both anchors correct.\n\nC. GTEYKRSLV\n- Length: $9$.\n- $P2 = T$ (does not match $L$ or $M$).\n- $P9 = V$ (matches).\n- Prediction: poor binder due to incorrect dominant $P2$ anchor, even though $P9$ fits.\n\nD. KLPQEVIGA\n- Length: $9$.\n- $P2 = L$ (matches).\n- $P9 = A$ (matches).\n- Prediction: strong binder (both anchors correct).\n\nBetween A and D, both satisfy the dominant and secondary anchors. In HLA-A2 family molecules, $P9=V$ typically makes stronger hydrophobic contacts in the F pocket than $P9=A$, leading to tighter binding when all else is equal. Therefore, among the strong binders, A is predicted to be the strongest.\n\nThus, the strongest binder is peptide A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2275854"}, {"introduction": "Our understanding of antigen processing is constantly evolving, moving beyond simplified textbook models. While we often think of peptides as simple, linear fragments of a protein, the proteasome has surprising capabilities. This final exercise [@problem_id:2275848] challenges you to think like a biochemist and hypothesize about the mechanism behind 'peptide splicing,' a process where the proteasome creates a novel epitope by joining two non-contiguous protein fragments. This problem deepens your understanding of the proteasome's function and reveals the hidden complexity that contributes to the diversity of the presented peptide repertoire.", "problem": "In the cellular immune response, cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize foreign or abnormal peptides displayed on the surface of host cells by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. The canonical pathway involves the degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome into short peptide fragments, which are then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum and loaded onto MHC class I molecules. This process was long thought to generate peptides that correspond to contiguous, linear sequences from the source protein.\n\nHowever, research has revealed the existence of \"spliced\" peptides, where two non-contiguous fragments from the same protein are ligated together to form the final epitope presented by MHC class I. This peptide splicing event is now understood to be an intrinsic capability of the proteasome itself.\n\nConsider the general structure of the 26S proteasome, which consists of a 20S catalytic core and 19S regulatory particles. The 20S core is a hollow barrel-shaped structure containing the proteolytic active sites. A substrate protein is unfolded and threaded into this barrel, where it is cleaved into smaller peptides.\n\nGiven this context, which of the following provides the most biochemically plausible mechanistic hypothesis for the generation of a spliced peptide by the 20S catalytic core of the proteasome?\n\nA. A protein fragment is cleaved, forming a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate with a catalytic residue in the proteasome. Before this intermediate is hydrolyzed by a water molecule, the free N-terminus of a second, nearby peptide fragment acts as a nucleophile, attacking the intermediate and ligating the two fragments together.\nB. Two non-contiguous fragments are generated by standard cleavage, diffuse freely within the proteasome's central cavity, and are subsequently joined by a separate, ATP-dependent ligase enzyme that is a newly discovered component of the 20S core.\nC. The 19S regulatory particle specifically recognizes two non-contiguous sequences on the target protein, folds them into close proximity, and uses a unique transpeptidase activity within the 19S particle to ligate them *before* the modified protein is injected into the 20S core for degradation.\nD. The proteasome uses a short, transient guide RNA molecule as a template. The two peptide fragments anneal to adjacent positions on this guide RNA, facilitating their ligation by one of the proteasome's standard catalytic sites.\nE. The proteasome cleaves the protein into a complete set of small fragments. These fragments are all released into the cytosol, where a specialized \"peptide-splicing\" enzyme distinct from the proteasome ligates specific pairs before they are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum.", "solution": "The 20S proteasome core is a self-compartmentalized protease with N-terminal threonine catalytic residues in the beta subunits. Its established catalytic cycle proceeds via nucleophilic attack by the $O_{\\gamma}$ of the N-terminal threonine on the carbonyl carbon of a substrate peptide bond to form a tetrahedral intermediate stabilized by the oxyanion hole, which collapses to an acyl-enzyme intermediate linking the substrate’s acyl portion to the threonine oxygen. Under canonical proteolysis, this acyl-enzyme intermediate is then resolved by hydrolysis: a water molecule, activated by the catalytic environment (including the threonine amino group acting as a general base), attacks the acyl carbonyl, releasing the cleaved peptide and regenerating the free enzyme.\n\nProteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing can be explained by an alternative resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate through aminolysis (a transpeptidation reaction): instead of water serving as the nucleophile, the free N-terminal amino group of another peptide fragment within the confined proteolytic chamber attacks the acyl-enzyme carbonyl. This generates a new peptide bond between two non-contiguous segments from the same source protein and simultaneously releases the catalytic threonine, thus producing a ligated, “spliced” peptide. The high local concentration of peptide fragments within the proteasome lumen and the reactive acyl-enzyme intermediate provide a biochemically plausible and experimentally supported mechanism for such splicing without requiring extrinsic energy input or additional enzymes.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A describes precisely this transpeptidation mechanism: formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate followed by nucleophilic attack by a second peptide’s N-terminus prior to hydrolysis by water. This is the established, biochemically plausible model for proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing.\n- B posits a separate, ATP-dependent ligase inside the 20S core. The 20S core does not contain ATP-dependent activities; ATPases reside in the 19S regulatory particle, and there is no known ligase in the 20S. This conflicts with known proteasome composition and the intrinsic splicing activity of the core.\n- C assigns specific recognition and a unique transpeptidase activity to the 19S particle, acting before substrate entry into the 20S. The 19S recognizes ubiquitinated substrates and unfolds them but lacks a demonstrated transpeptidase, and proteasome-catalyzed splicing is localized to the 20S catalytic chamber.\n- D invokes an RNA template guiding ligation. There is no evidence for RNA components templating proteasomal reactions; the proteasome is a proteinaceous machine, and such RNA-mediated annealing is implausible in this context.\n- E proposes cytosolic ligation by a distinct enzyme after complete release. Empirical data support that splicing is an intrinsic capability of the proteasome, not a separate cytosolic ligase.\n\nTherefore, the most biochemically plausible mechanism is the acyl-enzyme intermediate undergoing aminolysis by a second peptide’s N-terminus within the 20S core, as described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2275848"}]}
