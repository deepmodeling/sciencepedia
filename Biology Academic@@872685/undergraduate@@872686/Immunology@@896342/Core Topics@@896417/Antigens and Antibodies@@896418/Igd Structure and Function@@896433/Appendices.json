Each immunoglobulin monomer consists of two identical Fab arms, so a monomeric immunoglobulin has valence $2$.\n\nMembrane-bound IgM (mIgM) on naive B cells exists as a monomer in the B-cell receptor complex. Although secreted IgM is a pentamer (valence $10$) linked by a J chain, the membrane form is not pentameric; it remains a single IgM monomer associated with the signaling heterodimer $Ig\\alpha/Ig\\beta$. Therefore, a single mIgM molecule on the membrane has valence $2$.\n\nMembrane-bound IgD (mIgD) also exists as a monomer on naive B cells. As a monomeric immunoglobulin, it likewise has two Fab arms and thus valence $2$.\n\nHence, for single molecules on the plasma membrane, both mIgM and mIgD have antigen-binding valence $2$. Among the options, this corresponds to choice B.\n\nOther options are incorrect because:\n- Valence $10$ applies to secreted pentameric IgM, not membrane IgM.\n- IgD is monomeric and has valence $2$, not $1$ or $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2235032"}, {"introduction": "The unique biological roles of IgD are intrinsically linked to its distinct structure, particularly its exceptionally long and flexible hinge region. This exercise uses a classic biochemical technique—enzymatic digestion—as a thought experiment to explore the consequences of this structural feature. By predicting the outcome of papain digestion, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how the physical properties of the IgD molecule, specifically its proteolytic lability, set it apart from other antibody isotypes [@problem_id:2235094].", "problem": "An immunologist is studying the structural properties of different antibody isotypes. A purified sample of human monomeric Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is subjected to enzymatic digestion using papain. Papain is a protease known to cleave immunoglobulins in the hinge region. Unlike other isotypes, IgD is distinguished by an exceptionally long and flexible hinge region, which confers unique structural and functional properties. Based on the known action of papain and the specific structural characteristics of IgD, predict the major stable protein fragments that would be recovered after the digestion reaction is complete.\n\nThe structure of an antibody generally consists of two Fragment antigen-binding (Fab) regions and one Fragment crystallizable (Fc) region.\n\nA. Two Fab fragments and one intact Fc fragment.\n\nB. One F(ab')2 fragment and numerous small peptides derived from the Fc region.\n\nC. Two separate heavy chains and two separate light chains.\n\nD. Primarily two Fab fragments, with the Fc region being extensively degraded into small peptides.\n\nE. The entire IgD molecule remains intact, as it is resistant to papain.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the products of papain digestion of Immunoglobulin D (IgD), taking into account its unique structural features.\n\nStep 1: Understand the general structure of an antibody.\nAn antibody, or immunoglobulin, is a Y-shaped protein composed of four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light (L) chains, linked by disulfide bonds. The molecule can be functionally divided into two main types of regions. The two \"arms\" of the Y are called the Fragment antigen-binding (Fab) regions, each consisting of one full light chain and the N-terminal portion of a heavy chain. The \"stem\" of the Y is called the Fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, composed of the C-terminal portions of the two heavy chains linked together. The Fab and Fc regions are connected by a flexible \"hinge\" region.\n\nStep 2: Understand the action of the enzyme papain on a typical antibody.\nPapain is a non-specific protease. When used to digest a typical antibody like IgG, it cleaves the heavy chains in the hinge region *above* the inter-chain disulfide bonds that link the two heavy chains. This cleavage results in the release of three main fragments: two identical Fab fragments (each arm of the Y) and one intact Fc fragment (the entire stem of the Y). This outcome is the basis for option A.\n\nStep 3: Consider the specific structure of IgD.\nThe key information provided is that IgD has an \"exceptionally long and flexible hinge region.\" This extended and exposed structure makes it much more susceptible to proteolytic degradation than the more compact hinge regions of other isotypes like IgG.\n\nStep 4: Combine the action of papain with the unique structure of IgD.\nWhile papain's primary cleavage site is in the hinge, the extreme length and susceptibility of the IgD hinge mean that it is not cleaved at a single, neat point. Instead, the entire hinge region is likely to be extensively degraded by the protease. This high susceptibility to proteolysis also extends to the IgD Fc region (composed of Cδ2 and Cδ3 domains), which lacks the stability of the IgG Fc region. Consequently, after the Fab fragments are cleaved off, the remaining Fc portion is also broken down by papain into numerous small, non-recoverable peptides. The Fab fragments, being compact and stable globular domains, resist further degradation and remain as the major stable products.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. Two Fab fragments and one intact Fc fragment. This is the classic result for IgG, not IgD. It fails to account for the lability of the IgD hinge and Fc regions.\n- B. One F(ab')2 fragment and numerous small peptides derived from the Fc region. An F(ab')2 fragment, where the two Fab arms are still linked, is the characteristic product of digestion with the enzyme *pepsin*, which cleaves *below* the hinge disulfide bonds. This is incorrect for papain digestion.\n- C. Two separate heavy chains and two separate light chains. This would be the result of using a reducing agent (like β-mercaptoethanol) to break the disulfide bonds, not enzymatic cleavage by a protease.\n- D. Primarily two Fab fragments, with the Fc region being extensively degraded into small peptides. This correctly reflects the high susceptibility of the IgD hinge and Fc regions to proteolysis by papain, leaving the stable Fab fragments as the only major recoverable products.\n- E. The entire IgD molecule remains intact, as it is resistant to papain. This is incorrect; the long hinge makes IgD particularly sensitive, not resistant, to proteases.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction for the major stable products of IgD digestion by papain is two Fab fragments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2235094"}, {"introduction": "The ability of a B-cell to produce both a membrane-bound receptor and a secreted antibody from the same heavy chain gene is a marvel of molecular efficiency, controlled by sophisticated RNA processing mechanisms. This practice problem presents a genetic engineering scenario to test your understanding of how alternative polyadenylation directs the final form of the IgD heavy chain. By working through this molecular puzzle, you will clarify the link between gene structure, mRNA processing, and the ultimate destination of the IgD protein [@problem_id:2235081].", "problem": "In a mature naive B-lymphocyte, co-expression of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin D (IgD) on the cell surface as B-cell receptors (BCRs) is a hallmark of this developmental stage. This co-expression is achieved through the alternative processing of a single, long primary messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. This transcript originates from the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus and contains the variable region exons (VDJ) followed by the constant region exons for both the $\\mu$ chain (C$\\mu$) and the $\\delta$ chain (C$\\delta$).\n\nFor each isotype, the final segment of the heavy chain is determined by another layer of alternative splicing. The gene locus contains separate exons for a secretory tailpiece (S-exon) and for a transmembrane domain (M-exons). The choice between producing a secreted antibody or a membrane-bound receptor depends on which of two polyadenylation signals is used. Using the polyadenylation signal (pA$_{S}$) following the S-exon results in a secreted protein. Splicing out the S-exon and using the more downstream polyadenylation signal (pA$_{M}$) following the M-exons results in a membrane-anchored protein.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered strain of mice where B-cells carry a specific homozygous mutation. This mutation completely inactivates the polyadenylation signal pA$_{\\delta,S}$, which is located just downstream of the S-exon for the $\\delta$ heavy chain. All other components of the IgH locus, including all splicing signals and the polyadenylation signal for the membrane-bound $\\delta$ chain (pA$_{\\delta,M}$), remain fully functional. The cellular machinery that preferentially directs RNA processing toward the C$\\delta$ region in mature B-cells is also unaffected.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the predominant immunoglobulin heavy chain protein expressed from the C$\\delta$ gene locus and its cellular fate in a mature naive B-cell from these mice?\n\nA. A truncated $\\delta$ heavy chain that results from premature termination of translation and is rapidly degraded within the cell.\n\nB. A full-length $\\delta$ heavy chain with a secretory tailpiece, which is secreted from the cell.\n\nC. A hybrid $\\mu$-$\\delta$ heavy chain protein that is non-functional and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nD. A full-length $\\delta$ heavy chain containing a C-terminal transmembrane domain, which is located in the cell's plasma membrane.\n\nE. No $\\delta$ heavy chain is produced; the cell exclusively expresses IgM on its surface and as a secreted antibody.", "solution": "In mature naive B cells, the immunoglobulin heavy chain primary transcript includes $VDJ$ followed by $C\\mu$ and $C\\delta$. Co-expression of surface IgM and IgD is achieved by alternative splicing that selects either $C\\mu$- or $C\\delta$-containing exons, with mature B cells having RNA processing biased toward $C\\delta$. For each isotype, a second layer of alternative processing determines secreted versus membrane forms: usage of the polyadenylation site immediately downstream of the secretory tailpiece exon, pA$_{S}$, produces a secreted form, whereas skipping the S-exon, splicing to the M-exons, and cleavage at the downstream pA$_{M}$ yields a membrane-anchored form.\n\nIn the engineered mice, only pA$_{\\delta,S}$ is inactivated; all splicing signals and pA$_{\\delta,M}$ are intact, and the cellular machinery still preferentially directs processing toward $C\\delta$. Because pA$_{\\delta,S}$ is nonfunctional, cleavage and polyadenylation cannot occur at this proximal site for $C\\delta$ transcripts. As a result, transcripts that proceed into the $C\\delta$ region will not terminate at the S-exon but will continue through the M-exons. The default productive pathway in the absence of a functional proximal pA site is to splice out the S-exon, include the M-exons, and cleave and polyadenylate at pA$_{\\delta,M}$. This produces an mRNA encoding a full-length $\\delta$ heavy chain with a C-terminal transmembrane domain.\n\nThe encoded $\\delta$ heavy chain will assemble with light chains and traffic to the plasma membrane as a membrane-bound IgD BCR. There is no basis for a truncated $\\delta$ chain from premature termination (since pA$_{\\delta,M}$ is functional), no secreted $\\delta$ chain (because pA$_{\\delta,S}$ is inactive), no hybrid $\\mu$-$\\delta$ protein (processing selects either $C\\mu$ or $C\\delta$ exons within the same locus rather than fusing their coding regions), and no complete loss of $\\delta$ expression (since the membrane-anchored pathway remains intact and is favored by the processing bias toward $C\\delta$).\n\nTherefore, the predominant protein from the $C\\delta$ locus is a full-length $\\delta$ heavy chain containing a C-terminal transmembrane domain located in the plasma membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2235081"}]}
