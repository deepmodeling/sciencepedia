Its structural integrity is maintained by a network of disulfide bonds. To analyze its subunit composition, a researcher plans to use a reducing agent, Dithiothreitol (DTT), to break all of these bonds.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, consider the following structural model for a single secreted pentameric IgM complex:\n\n1.  **Monomeric Unit:** The fundamental building block is an IgM monomer.
