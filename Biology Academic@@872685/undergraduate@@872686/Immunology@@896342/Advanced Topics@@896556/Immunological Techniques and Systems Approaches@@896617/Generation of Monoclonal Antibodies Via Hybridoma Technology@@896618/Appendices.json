[@problem_id:2230964]", "problem": "In an immunology laboratory, a researcher aims to generate monoclonal antibodies against a specific protein from a newly discovered virus. The standard procedure for creating hybridoma cells is initiated. This involves immunizing a mouse with the viral protein and then harvesting its spleen cells, which include antibody-producing B-cells. These spleen cells are then fused with a special line of myeloma (cancerous plasma) cells. The resulting mixture of cells is cultured in a selective medium known as Hypoxanthine-Aminopterin-Thymidine (HAT) medium. The myeloma cell line used for this procedure is supposed to be deficient in the enzyme Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT-), which is crucial for the cell's survival in HAT medium. The spleen cells, by contrast, are HGPRT-positive (HGPRT+) but have a finite lifespan.\n\nAfter setting up the culture, the researcher discovers a critical error: the myeloma cell line used for the fusion was not the required HGPRT-negative strain but a different, HGPRT-positive (HGPRT+) strain.\n\nAssuming the fusion process itself was successful, predict the most likely outcome for the mixed cell culture after several weeks of growth in the HAT selection medium.\n\nA. Only the desired hybridoma cells will survive and proliferate, leading to a successful production of monoclonal antibodies.\nB. All cells in the culture, including unfused spleen cells, unfused myeloma cells, and hybridomas, will be unable to grow and will die.\nC. The culture will be dominated by a population of rapidly growing, unfused myeloma cells, rendering the selection of antibody-producing hybridomas ineffective.\nD. Only the fused hybridoma cells and the unfused spleen cells will initially survive, but eventually only the hybridomas will remain.\nE. The aminopterin in the HAT medium will fail to block nucleotide synthesis in all cells, allowing all original cell populations to grow uncontrollably.", "solution": "HAT selection relies on blocking de novo nucleotide synthesis and forcing cells to use the salvage pathway. Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, shutting down de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis. Hypoxanthine and thymidine in the medium permit nucleotide synthesis only via the salvage pathway, which requires hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) for purine salvage and thymidine kinase for thymidine salvage. Thus, in HAT:\n$$\\text{Survival in HAT} \\iff \\text{functional salvage pathway (HGPRT present, and thymidine kinase present)}.$$\nIn the standard hybridoma protocol, the myeloma partner is deliberately HGPRT-negative, so unfused myeloma cells cannot use the salvage pathway and die in HAT, while spleen cells (HGPRT-positive but non-immortal) survive only transiently. Fused hybridomas inherit immortality from the myeloma line and HGPRT from the spleen B-cells, so they uniquely survive long term.\n\nHere, the error is that the myeloma line was HGPRT-positive. Evaluate each population:\n- Unfused myeloma cells (HGPRT-positive): de novo pathway is blocked by aminopterin, but the salvage pathway is intact, so they survive and proliferate indefinitely.\n- Unfused spleen cells (HGPRT-positive, finite lifespan): they can initially survive via salvage but will senesce and die over weeks because they are not immortal.\n- Hybridomas (immortal and HGPRT-positive via the spleen genome): they also survive and can proliferate.\n\nAfter several weeks, the culture will be dominated by rapidly dividing unfused myeloma cells because they are immortal, numerous, and fully capable of growth in HAT. This overgrowth makes isolation of antibody-producing hybridomas ineffective.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect because unfused HGPRT-positive myeloma cells also survive and proliferate.\n- B is incorrect because both HGPRT-positive myeloma cells and hybridomas survive in HAT.\n- C is correct: unfused HGPRT-positive myeloma cells will dominate the culture, thwarting selection.\n- D is incorrect because it omits survival of unfused myeloma cells; they do survive and overgrow the culture.\n- E is incorrect because aminopterin still blocks de novo synthesis; growth depends on the salvage pathway, which is functional in HGPRT-positive cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2230964"}, {"introduction": "While the $HGPRT^{-}$ myeloma cell is the textbook example, the principles of metabolic selection in hybridoma technology are universal. This practice problem challenges you to adapt your knowledge to a non-standard scenario involving a myeloma cell line that is deficient in a different salvage pathway enzyme, thymidine kinase ($TK^{-}$). Designing the appropriate selective medium for this situation requires a more profound grasp of how the *de novo* and salvage synthesis pathways are controlled. [@problem_id:2230957]", "problem": "In the development of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology, a crucial step involves selecting for the successfully fused hybridoma cells while eliminating unfused parental cells. The standard procedure often uses a myeloma (cancerous B-cell) fusion partner that is deficient in the enzyme Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT-), which is essential for the purine salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis.\n\nImagine a scenario where a researcher is working with a non-standard myeloma cell line. This particular line is deficient in the enzyme Thymidine Kinase (TK-) but has a fully functional HGPRT enzyme (HGPRT+). Thymidine Kinase is the key enzyme for the pyrimidine salvage pathway. The B-cells harvested from the immunized animal for the fusion are, as is typical, proficient in both enzymes (TK+ and HGPRT+).\n\nTo create the necessary selective pressure, the researcher considers several formulations for the culture medium. All formulations are based on a basal medium that supports cell growth but lacks key nucleotides. The key drug, aminopterin, is an inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Blocking DHFR effectively shuts down both the *de novo* purine and *de novo* pyrimidine synthesis pathways, forcing cells to rely on their respective salvage pathways to survive.\n\nGiven the unique (TK-, HGPRT+) genotype of the myeloma cells, which one of the following media would successfully allow for the survival and proliferation of the desired hybridoma cells while ensuring the death of the unfused myeloma cells?\n\nA.

Under aminopterin pressure, cell survival requires functional salvage pathways for both purines and pyrimidines. For purines, hypoxanthine is salvaged by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) to form inosine monophosphate: \n$$\\text{hypoxanthine} \\xrightarrow{\\text{HGPRT}} \\text{IMP}.$$\nFor pyrimidines, thymidine is salvaged by thymidine kinase (TK) to form thymidine monophosphate:\n$$\\text{thymidine} \\xrightarrow{\\text{TK}} \\text{TMP}.$$\nThe myeloma line in this scenario is TK- and HGPRT+, whereas normal B-cells are TK+ and HGPRT+. Hybridomas formed by fusion inherit TK and HGPRT from the B-cell partner and thus are TK+ and HGPRT+.\n\nEvaluate each medium:\n- Option A (aminopterin + thymidine): With de novo purine synthesis blocked by aminopterin and no hypoxanthine supplied, purines cannot be obtained via salvage. All cells, including hybridomas, fail due to purine deficiency.\n- Option B (aminopterin + hypoxanthine): With de novo pyrimidine synthesis blocked and no thymidine supplied, pyrimidines (specifically dTMP) cannot be obtained via TK-dependent salvage. All cells, including hybridomas, fail due to pyrimidine deficiency.\n- Option C (6-thioguanine alone): 6-thioguanine is converted by HGPRT to toxic nucleotides, selectively killing HGPRT+ cells. This would kill both the HGPRT+ myeloma and the desired HGPRT+ hybridomas (and HGPRT+ B-cells). It does not provide a rescue pathway and is not selective for hybrids.\n- Option E (bromodeoxyuridine alone): BrdU is phosphorylated by TK to toxic nucleotides, killing TK+ cells while sparing TK- cells. This would eliminate TK+ hybrids and B-cells and spare the TK- myeloma—opposite of the goal.\n\nOption D (hypoxanthine + aminopterin + thymidine, i.e., HAT medium) blocks de novo synthesis with aminopterin and supplies both salvage substrates. Only cells with both HGPRT and TK can survive: unfused myeloma (TK-) die because they cannot form TMP from thymidine; unfused B-cells (TK+, HGPRT+) may transiently survive but are not immortal and die out; hybridomas (TK+, HGPRT+) survive and proliferate using both salvage pathways.

The answer lies in limiting dilution cloning, a technique grounded in statistics. This problem explores the mathematical logic behind this crucial step, using the Poisson distribution to calculate the likelihood of isolating a truly monoclonal population, bridging the gap between cell culture practice and probability theory. [@problem_id:2230985]", "problem": "In the process of generating monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology, a critical step is limiting dilution cloning. This technique aims to isolate a single antibody-producing cell to establish a clonal population. A researcher prepares a suspension of hybridoma cells and distributes it across the wells of a microtiter plate. The number of cells, $k$, that land in any given well can be accurately modeled by a Poisson distribution, $P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$, where $\\lambda$ is the average number of cells per well.\n\nDue to a dilution error, the researcher prepares a cell suspension that, when plated, results in an average of $\\lambda = 0.5$ cells per well. After a suitable incubation period, the researcher observes which wells exhibit cell growth (these are termed \"positive\" wells, meaning they contain at least one cell). A single positive well is then selected at random for subsequent expansion.\n\nCalculate the probability that this randomly selected positive well is polyclonal, meaning it originated from two or more cells. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a randomly selected positive well is polyclonal. This is a conditional probability: the probability that a well contains two or more cells ($k \\ge 2$), given that it contains at least one cell ($k \\ge 1$). We can write this as $P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1)$.\n\nThe average number of cells per well is given as $\\lambda = 0.5$. The probability of a well containing exactly $k$ cells is given by the Poisson distribution:\n$$P(k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\n\nFirst, let's define the events. Let $A$ be the event that a well is polyclonal ($k \\ge 2$), and let $B$ be the event that a well is positive ($k \\ge 1$). We want to calculate $P(A|B)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nThe event \"$A \\cap B$\" means the well is polyclonal AND positive. If a well has two or more cells, it automatically has at least one cell. Therefore, the event $A \\cap B$ is identical to event $A$. So, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(k \\ge 2 | k \\ge 1) = \\frac{P(k \\ge 2)}{P(k \\ge 1)}$$\n\nAn alternative and slightly more intuitive way to frame this is to consider the complement event.
