{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To successfully attack a cancer cell, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) must first recognize it. This recognition depends on tumor antigens being presented by MHC class I molecules on the cancer cell's surface. This practice explores a common strategy tumors use to become \"invisible\" to CTLs and the surprising consequence this has for a different type of immune cell, the Natural Killer (NK) cell [@problem_id:2262654]. Understanding this trade-off is crucial for appreciating the complex landscape of anti-tumor immunity.", "problem": "In an experimental cancer immunology study, a particular melanoma cell line is a target for immune-mediated destruction. Two distinct populations of cytotoxic effector cells are isolated from a mouse that was previously immunized against this specific melanoma: 1) Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) that are known to be specific for a particular tumor antigen expressed by the melanoma, and 2) Natural Killer (NK) cells.\n\nWhen the melanoma cells are co-cultured separately with each effector cell population, a distinct pattern of susceptibility is observed. The melanoma cells show significant resistance to being killed by the tumor-specific CTLs. However, they are found to be highly susceptible to lysis by the NK cells.\n\nWhich of the following changes in cell surface protein expression on the melanoma cells provides the most comprehensive explanation for this observed phenomenon?\n\nA. Significant downregulation of Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules.\n\nB. Upregulation of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1).\n\nC. Significant downregulation of Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) molecules.\n\nD. Upregulation of Fas Ligand (FasL).\n\nE. Downregulation of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1).", "solution": "We first identify the mechanistic requirements for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing. CTLs recognize target cells when a specific peptide derived from the tumor antigen is presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules to the T cell receptor, with CD8 serving as a co-receptor. Therefore, effective CTL-mediated cytotoxicity requires adequate expression of MHC-I on the target cell surface. If MHC-I is significantly downregulated, the tumor antigenic peptide cannot be presented, and the CTL cannot engage productively, resulting in resistance to CTL-mediated killing.\n\nNext, we analyze the activation logic of Natural Killer (NK) cells. NK cells integrate inhibitory and activating signals. A dominant inhibitory signal arises from engagement of inhibitory NK receptors (such as KIR or Ly49 family receptors) by self MHC-I molecules on target cells. Loss or downregulation of MHC-I removes this inhibitory input, a phenomenon termed “missing-self,” which shifts the balance toward NK activation and results in enhanced NK-mediated lysis of the target cell.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against the observed pattern—resistance to tumor-specific CTLs and high susceptibility to NK killing:\n\n- A. Significant downregulation of MHC-I: This simultaneously prevents CTL recognition (explaining resistance to CTLs) and removes NK inhibitory signaling (explaining increased NK susceptibility). This provides a comprehensive, canonical explanation via the missing-self mechanism.\n- B. Upregulation of PD-L1: This can inhibit CTLs through PD-1 and contribute to resistance to CTL killing, but it does not inherently increase susceptibility to NK lysis; NK cells are not universally inhibited by PD-1, and PD-L1 upregulation does not produce the missing-self signal that robustly augments NK cytotoxicity.\n- C. Significant downregulation of MHC-II: CTL recognition of tumor antigens is MHC-I restricted, not MHC-II restricted. Changes in MHC-II do not explain resistance to CD8 CTLs nor increased NK susceptibility.\n- D. Upregulation of FasL: Tumor expression of FasL may induce apoptosis in Fas-expressing T cells (a “counterattack”), potentially dampening CTL responses, but it does not explain why the tumor cells themselves would be more susceptible to NK-mediated lysis.\n- E. Downregulation of ICAM-1: This would generally reduce stable immunologic synapse formation and impair both CTL and NK killing, not selectively increase NK-mediated lysis.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and mechanistically consistent explanation is significant downregulation of MHC-I on the melanoma cells, which causes CTL evasion and simultaneously triggers NK cell activation via missing-self.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2262654"}, {"introduction": "Even when a T cell successfully recognizes a cancer cell, the attack is not guaranteed. The immune system has built-in \"checkpoint\" pathways to prevent excessive inflammation, and tumors can hijack these pathways to protect themselves. This exercise examines the direct consequence of the interaction between the PD-1 receptor on a T cell and its ligand, PD-L1, on a tumor cell, which forms the central principle behind a revolutionary class of cancer drugs [@problem_id:2262691].", "problem": "A pathologist is studying a biopsy from a patient diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Immunohistochemical staining reveals that the cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment have a significantly high surface expression of a protein called Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1). Further analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes shows that many of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) present express the corresponding receptor, Programmed Death-1 (PD-1). A primary function of these CTLs is to recognize and kill cancer cells by a process involving their T-cell receptor (TCR).\n\nGiven this scenario, if a PD-1-positive CTL directly engages with a PD-L1-positive cancer cell, what is the most direct immunological consequence for the CTL?\n\nA. The T cell undergoes rapid proliferation and clonal expansion, triggered by the strong co-stimulatory signal from the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.\n\nB. The T cell's activity is unaffected, as the primary interaction for cytotoxicity is between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the antigen-MHC complex on the cancer cell.\n\nC. The ligation of PD-1 on the T cell delivers an inhibitory signal that dampens downstream signaling from the T-cell receptor, leading to T-cell anergy or exhaustion.\n\nD. The T cell is induced to release a surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines, recruiting other immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages to the tumor site.\n\nE. The interaction triggers the T cell to differentiate into a plasma cell and begin secreting antibodies specific to the cancer cell.", "solution": "We identify the key receptor-ligand pair: PD-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and PD-L1 on tumor cells. PD-1 is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor that contains cytoplasmic ITIM and ITSM motifs. Upon ligation by PD-L1, PD-1 becomes phosphorylated and recruits SH2-domain containing phosphatases, notably SHP-2 (and SHP-1), to its cytoplasmic motifs.\n\nThese phosphatases dephosphorylate proximal T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling components, including CD3 zeta chains and ZAP-70, and attenuate downstream pathways such as PI3K-Akt and Ras-MAPK. The direct consequence is decreased TCR signaling strength, resulting in reduced IL-2 production, diminished proliferation, decreased cytotoxic effector function, and reduced cytokine secretion. Over time, persistent PD-1 signaling in chronic antigen exposure, such as in tumors, promotes T-cell anergy and functional exhaustion.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because PD-1 is not a co-stimulatory receptor; co-stimulation is mediated by CD28 engaging B7 molecules. PD-1 engagement is inhibitory, not stimulatory.\n- Option B is incorrect because PD-1 engagement directly modulates and dampens TCR signaling; the T cell is not unaffected.\n- Option C is correct because PD-1 ligation delivers inhibitory signals that dampen TCR signaling and lead to anergy or exhaustion.\n- Option D is incorrect because PD-1 signaling suppresses, rather than induces, a surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n- Option E is incorrect because CTLs do not differentiate into plasma cells; that is a B-cell fate.\n\nTherefore, the most direct immunological consequence for the CTL upon PD-1 engagement by PD-L1 on the tumor cell is inhibitory signaling leading to anergy or exhaustion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2262691"}, {"introduction": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy represents a powerful approach where a patient's own T cells are engineered to recognize and kill cancer cells, bypassing the need for MHC presentation. A critical design choice is the binding strength, or affinity, of the CAR for its target antigen. This practice uses a quantitative model to explore the delicate balance between making CAR-T cells potent enough to destroy tumors while preventing them from attacking healthy tissues that express low levels of the same antigen [@problem_id:2262641]. This illustrates a key engineering trade-off in designing safer and more effective living drugs.", "problem": "In the development of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, a critical design parameter is the binding affinity of the CAR's single-chain variable fragment (scFv) for its target tumor antigen. This affinity influences both the therapy's effectiveness against cancer cells and its potential for \"on-target, off-tumor\" toxicity, where healthy tissues expressing the antigen at low levels are also attacked.\n\nConsider a simplified biophysical model where a CAR T-cell is activated to kill a target cell if the fractional occupancy of its surface CARs, $\\theta$, exceeds a certain activation threshold, $f_{activ}$.
