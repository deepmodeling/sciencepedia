Functionally, this requires early classical components and the terminal cascade:\n- Classical pathway sequence: antigen-bound IgG/IgM activates C1 ($C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$), which cleaves $C4$ and $C2$ to form the C3 convertase $C4b2a$, then $C3$ is cleaved to $C3b$, forming the C5 convertase and initiating MAC formation $C5b-C9$.\nThus, CH50 depends on {$C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$, $C4$, $C2$, $C3$, $C5$, $C6$, $C7$, $C8$, $C9$}.\n\nThe APH50 assay measures the integrity of the alternative pathway, which proceeds independently of C1, C2, and C4:\n- Alternative pathway sequence: spontaneous C3 hydrolysis yields C3b, which binds factor B; factor D cleaves factor B to form the C3 convertase $C3bBb$, stabilized by properdin (P). This then activates C5 and drives MAC formation $C5b-C9$.\nThus, APH50 depends on {factor B, factor D, properdin, $C3$, $C5$, $C6$, $C7$, $C8$, $C9$}.\n\nGiven APH50 is normal, all proteins required for the alternative pathway are functionally intact, including the shared components $C3$ and $C5-C9$.

The classical-specific candidates are $C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$, $C4$, or $C2$. Among the provided options, only $C4$ (choice C) is such a component.\n\nThe clinical history further supports an early classical pathway deficiency: deficiencies of $C1q$, $C2$, or $C4$ are classically associated with a lupus-like disease and increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections due to impaired clearance of immune complexes and opsonization.\n\nTherefore, the most likely single complement protein deficiency is $C4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2224467"}, {"introduction": "After an initial screen points to a defect in a shared part of the complement cascade, the diagnostic challenge is to pinpoint the exact protein at fault.

[@problem_id:2224421]", "problem": "A patient presents with a history of recurrent, severe infections caused by *Neisseria* species. Suspecting an underlying immune system defect, an immunologist orders a series of tests on the patient's serum.\n\nThe first tests are functional assays for the complement system. A total classical complement activity assay (CH50), which measures the functional integrity of the $C1$ through $C9$ components, yields a result of nearly zero. Similarly, an alternative pathway assay (AH50) also shows virtually no activity. These results suggest a defect in the terminal pathway, specifically in the components that form the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), the lytic pore-forming structure of the complement system.\n\nTo identify the specific faulty component, the immunologist performs a set of reconstitution experiments. In each experiment, the patient's serum is mixed with antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (the target for lysis) and a single, highly purified human complement protein.

The CH50 assay measures functional integrity of the classical pathway through formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), requiring components $C1$ through $C9$. The AH50 assay measures functional integrity of the alternative pathway, which also requires MAC formation. Near-zero CH50 and near-zero AH50 together indicate a defect in the common terminal pathway ($C5$ through $C9$), because defects restricted to early classical components (e.g., $C1q$) would reduce CH50 but not AH50, and defects restricted to the alternative pathway (e.g., Factor B) would reduce AH50 but not CH50.\n\nStep 2: Recall MAC assembly and its requirement for lysis. MAC is formed by sequential binding and insertion of complement components:\n$$\nC5 \\xrightarrow{\\text{C5 convertase}} C5b, \\quad C5b + C6 + C7 + C8 + n\\,C9 \\rightarrow \\text{MAC}.\n$$\nIn compact notation, the pore-forming complex can be written as $C5b6 \\cdot C7 \\cdot C8 \\cdot C9_{n}$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the reconstitution experiments. In such assays, if adding a purified component restores lysis, that component is the missing factor; if lysis remains absent, either that component is not missing, or a different essential component remains absent.\n- Experiment 1: Patient serum + $C8$ yields no lysis. If $C8$ were deficient, adding $C8$ would restore lysis; lack of restoration indicates $C8$ is present and not the deficient component.\n- Experiment 2: Patient serum + $C9$ yields normal lysis. Restoration of lysis by adding $C9$ indicates that $C9$ is the deficient component, because all upstream components ($C5$ through $C8$) must be present and functional for $C9$ addition alone to complete MAC formation.\n- Experiment 3: Patient serum + $C3$ yields no lysis. If $C3$ were deficient, adding $C3$ should restore the formation of C5 convertase and hence MAC-mediated lysis in the classical assay with antibody-coated erythrocytes. The failure to restore lysis rules out $C3$ deficiency and is consistent with a terminal MAC defect such as $C9$ deficiency, because adding $C3$ cannot compensate for absence of $C9$.\n\nStep 4: Exclude other options using pathway logic.\n- $C3$ deficiency would reduce both CH50 and AH50 but would be expected to be corrected by $C3$ addition in this setup; Experiment 3 contradicts this.\n- $C8$ deficiency would be corrected by $C8$ addition; Experiment 1 contradicts this, while Experiment 2 supports $C9$ deficiency.\n- Factor B deficiency would selectively depress AH50 with relatively preserved CH50; both are near zero here, so this is unlikely.\n- $C1q$ deficiency would depress CH50 but leave AH50 near normal; this is not observed.\n\nConclusion: The data localize the defect to $C9$.\n\nTherefore, the most probable deficiency is $C9$ deficiency.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2224421"}, {"introduction": "The health of the complement system depends on a delicate balance between activation and inhibition. This final problem shifts our focus from deficiencies in pathway components to the failure of regulation.

To investigate the root cause, genetic sequencing of the gene encoding $C3$ is performed, which reveals a completely normal, wild-type sequence, ruling out a primary defect in $C3$ production.\n\nThe central amplification loop of the complement system involves the C3 convertase, an enzyme complex that cleaves $C3$ into its active fragments. The activity of this convertase is normally under tight negative regulation to prevent systemic $C3$ depletion and host tissue damage.

The child has recurrent severe pyogenic infections and profoundly low serum $C3$ with a normal $C3$ gene, which indicates excessive consumption rather than impaired synthesis of $C3$.\n\n2.

Clinically, this causes recurrent pyogenic infections due to impaired opsonization.\n\n5. Evaluation of the options:\n- A. Properdin stabilizes $C3bBb$; deficiency would reduce alternative pathway activity and would not cause high $C3$ consumption. It classically predisposes to Neisseria infections with typically normal $C3$ levels.\n- B. $C5$ deficiency affects the terminal pathway and predisposes to Neisseria but does not cause systemic $C3$ consumption; $C3$ levels are usually normal.\n- C. Factor I deficiency removes the key negative regulator that inactivates $C3b$, causing uncontrolled C3 convertase activity and profound $C3$ depletion—matching the findings.\n- D.
