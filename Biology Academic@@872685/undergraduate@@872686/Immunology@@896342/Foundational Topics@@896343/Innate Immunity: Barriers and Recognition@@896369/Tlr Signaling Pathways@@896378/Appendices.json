However, the patient's immune system appears to control infections with flagellated Gram-negative bacteria, like *Salmonella enterica*, effectively.\n\nTo probe the patient's innate immune response, macrophages are isolated and cultured. These cells are then exposed to purified molecular components derived from different bacteria. The activation of the macrophages is quantified by measuring their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The experiment yields the following results:\n\n1.  When the patient's macrophages are exposed to purified flagellin, a primary protein component of bacterial flagella, they produce a robust amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines, comparable to cells from a healthy control donor.\n2.  When the patient's macrophages are exposed to purified lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, there is a negligible production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, control cells from a healthy donor show a strong response to LTA.\n\nThese observations suggest a genetic defect in a specific Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) recognition receptor.

TLR9", "solution": "The problem requires us to identify a malfunctioning Toll-like Receptor (TLR) based on the differential response of a patient's macrophages to two distinct Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). We must analyze each experimental result to deduce the functionality of the associated signaling pathways.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the response to flagellin. The problem states that the patient's macrophages exhibit a normal, robust response when stimulated with flagellin. Flagellin is the specific PAMP recognized by Toll-like Receptor 5 (TLR5). A normal response indicates that TLR5, as well as its downstream signaling machinery, is intact and functional in the patient's cells. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that TLR5 is not the defective receptor. This eliminates option D.\n\nNext, let's analyze the response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The problem states that the patient's macrophages show a negligible response to LTA, while control cells respond strongly. This indicates a defect in the signaling pathway responsible for recognizing LTA. LTA is a characteristic PAMP found in the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. The primary receptor for LTA is Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2), which often functions as a heterodimer with either TLR1 or TLR6 to recognize various bacterial cell wall components. The failure to respond to LTA strongly implicates a loss of function in TLR2. This aligns perfectly with the clinical observation that the patient is particularly susceptible to Gram-positive bacterial infections. Thus, option A is the most likely correct answer.\n\nTo ensure our conclusion is sound, let's evaluate the other options.\n- Option B, TLR3, is an endosomal receptor that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common PAMP associated with viral replication. A defect in TLR3 would not explain the lack of response to LTA, a bacterial component.\n- Option C, TLR4, is the canonical receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. A defect in TLR4 would primarily affect the response to Gram-negative bacteria. The patient's ability to control infections by Gram-negative *Salmonella* suggests that the TLR4 pathway is likely functional. Furthermore, a TLR4 defect would not account for the specific failure to recognize LTA.\n- Option E, TLR9, is another endosomal receptor that recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA motifs found in bacterial and viral DNA. A defect here is unrelated to the cell surface recognition of LTA or flagellin.\n\nIn summary, the normal response to flagellin confirms TLR5 is functional. The absent response to LTA confirms that the TLR2-mediated pathway is non-functional. Therefore, the most likely non-functional receptor in the patient is TLR2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2281194"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the cell surface to the cytoplasm, this exercise focuses on a critical control point shared by many TLR signaling cascades. The scenario [@problem_id:2281220] involves a hypothetical mutation in the IκB protein, which acts as the molecular leash restraining the powerful transcription factor NF-κB. Solving this problem will solidify your understanding of how this key inhibitory mechanism is regulated to precisely control the expression of inflammatory genes.", "problem": "In the innate immune response, activation of a Toll-like Receptor (TLR) by a pathogen-associated molecular pattern initiates a signaling cascade. A key outcome of this cascade is the activation of the transcription factor, Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-$\\kappa$B). In its resting state, NF-$\\kappa$B is held inactive in the cytoplasm by a dedicated inhibitory protein called Inhibitor of kappa B (I$\\kappa$B). Upon TLR stimulation, a kinase complex known as the I$\\kappa$B kinase (IKK) is activated, which then phosphorylates I$\\kappa$B. This phosphorylation event marks I$\\kappa$B for degradation by the proteasome, liberating NF-$\\kappa$B to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered cell line where the I$\\kappa$B protein has been mutated at its specific phosphorylation sites, such that the IKK complex can no longer phosphorylate it. If these cells are stimulated with a potent TLR ligand, which of the following outcomes is the most likely?\n\nA. NF-$\\kappa$B will be constitutively active, leading to constant pro-inflammatory gene transcription even without TLR stimulation.\n\nB. NF-$\\kappa$B will be targeted for proteasomal degradation along with the mutated I$\\kappa$B.\n\nC. NF-$\\kappa$B will remain bound to the mutated I$\\kappa$B in the cytoplasm.\n\nD. NF-$\\kappa$B will translocate to the nucleus but will be unable to bind to its target DNA sequences.\n\nE. The recruitment of IKK to the upstream signaling complex will be blocked.", "solution": "Toll-like receptor stimulation initiates a signaling cascade that activates the I$\\kappa$B kinase (IKK) complex. The canonical mechanism is as follows: in resting cells, NF-$\\kappa$B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by I$\\kappa$B via inhibitory binding. Upon TLR activation, upstream adaptors (such as MyD88 or TRIF) lead to activation of IKK. Active IKK phosphorylates specific serine residues on I$\\kappa$B. This phosphorylation serves as a signal for recognition by the ubiquitin ligase machinery, resulting in polyubiquitination of I$\\kappa$B and its subsequent proteasomal degradation. The degradation of I$\\kappa$B frees NF-$\\kappa$B, allowing NF-$\\kappa$B to translocate to the nucleus and bind target DNA sequences to drive transcription of pro-inflammatory genes.\n\nIn the engineered cells, I$\\kappa$B lacks the specific phosphorylation sites that are required for IKK-mediated phosphorylation. Therefore, even if TLR signaling robustly activates IKK, the mutated I$\\kappa$B cannot be phosphorylated. Without phosphorylation, I$\\kappa$B is not ubiquitinated and is not targeted for proteasomal degradation. Consequently, I$\\kappa$B remains stably bound to NF-$\\kappa$B in the cytoplasm, preventing NF-$\\kappa$B nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is incorrect because preventing I$\\kappa$B phosphorylation stabilizes the inhibitory complex, leading to reduced, not constitutive, NF-$\\kappa$B activity.\nB is incorrect because the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome targeting applies to I$\\kappa$B; NF-$\\kappa$B is not co-degraded with I$\\kappa$B.\nC is correct because the non-phosphorylatable I$\\kappa$B will not be degraded and will continue to sequester NF-$\\kappa$B in the cytoplasm.\nD is incorrect because NF-$\\kappa$B will not translocate to the nucleus if it remains bound to I$\\kappa$B.\nE is incorrect because the mutation in I$\\kappa$B does not impair upstream recruitment or activation of IKK; it blocks the downstream step of I$\\kappa$B phosphorylation.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is that NF-$\\kappa$B remains bound to the mutated I$\\kappa$B in the cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2281220"}, {"introduction": "Not all signaling pathways are linear; some branch to produce diverse and tailored outcomes from a single stimulus. This problem [@problem_id:2281250] explores the unique dual-pathway signaling of TLR4, the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). By dissecting a hypothetical scenario where one signaling arm is functional while the other is silent, you will learn to differentiate the distinct roles of the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF in orchestrating pro-inflammatory versus antiviral responses.", "problem": "A clinical immunologist is investigating a patient with a suspected primary immunodeficiency. The patient's macrophages are isolated and stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Laboratory analysis reveals that following LPS stimulation, the macrophages successfully produce and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). However, the same cells show a complete failure to produce type I interferons (e.g., IFN-β).\n\nThe receptor for LPS is Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), which is unique in its ability to initiate two distinct downstream signaling pathways. One pathway, known as the MyD88-dependent pathway, primarily drives the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The second pathway, known as the TRIF-dependent (or MyD88-independent) pathway, is primarily responsible for the production of type I interferons.

MyD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response 88)\n\nB. MAL (MyD88-adapter-like)\n\nC. TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β)\n\nD. TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule)", "solution": "First, identify the receptor and its bifurcated signaling. LPS engages TLR4, which uniquely signals via two distinct intracellular pathways: a MyD88-dependent pathway driving pro-inflammatory cytokines, and a TRIF-dependent pathway driving type I interferons.\n\nSecond, map pathway outputs to readouts. The MyD88-dependent pathway (requiring MyD88 and the bridging adaptor MAL, also called TIRAP) activates NF-$\\kappa$B and AP-1, resulting in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-$\\alpha$ and IL-6. The TRIF-dependent pathway (engaged by TRIF with the bridging adaptor TRAM for TLR4) activates IRF3 and IRF7, leading to transcription of type I interferons such as IFN-$\\beta$.\n\nThird, interpret the experimental observations. The macrophages produce TNF-$\\alpha$ and IL-6 normally after LPS, indicating that the MyD88-dependent arm is intact. They fail to produce type I interferons, indicating a defect restricted to the TRIF-dependent arm.\n\nFourth, align adaptor proteins with each pathway. \n- MyD88 and MAL are required for the MyD88-dependent pathway; intact pro-inflammatory cytokine production excludes deficiencies in MyD88 (option A) and MAL (option B).\n- The TRIF-dependent pathway requires TRIF and, specifically for TLR4, the bridging adaptor TRAM to recruit TRIF. A defect in this pathway would be explained by deficiency of TRIF (option C) or TRAM (option D).\n\nFifth, determine the most likely deficient adaptor based on the pathway responsible for type I interferons. The central adaptor that induces type I interferon signaling is TRIF; deficiency of TRIF abolishes the MyD88-independent, interferon-inducing pathway downstream of TLR4 while leaving the MyD88-dependent pathway intact, precisely matching the observed phenotype. Therefore, the most likely functionally deficient adaptor is TRIF.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2281250"}]}
