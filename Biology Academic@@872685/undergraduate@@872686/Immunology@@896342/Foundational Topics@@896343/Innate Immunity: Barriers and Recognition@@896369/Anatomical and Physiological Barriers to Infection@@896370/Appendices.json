Its ability to destroy bacteria is not universal but highly specific, targeting a particular component of the bacterial cell wall. This practice [@problem_id:2216287] explores this specificity, asking you to consider a scenario with a hypothetical microbe that lacks lysozyme's target, which will sharpen your understanding of enzyme-substrate interactions as a cornerstone of innate immunity.", "problem": "An immunologist is studying a novel extremophilic microorganism, tentatively named *Bacillus ignotus*, isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. A key finding is that its cellular envelope is composed of a unique S-layer protein lattice and a lipid membrane, but it completely lacks peptidoglycan, the polymer typically found in bacterial cell walls. To assess its susceptibility to components of the human innate immune system, the researcher incubates a culture of *B. ignotus* with a purified solution of human lysozyme at a concentration equivalent to that found in tears and saliva. Lysozyme is an enzyme that functions as an antimicrobial agent by hydrolyzing the beta-(1,4)-glycosidic linkages in peptidoglycan.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the experiment?\n\nA. *B. ignotus* will be rapidly killed, as lysozyme's enzymatic activity is broadly effective against various cell wall polymers.\n\nB. *B. ignotus* will be highly resistant to the lytic action of lysozyme, because the specific molecular target for the enzyme is absent.\n\nC. *B. ignotus* will be killed, because lysozyme's cationic nature allows it to disrupt the bacterial membrane, a mechanism independent of its enzymatic function.\n\nD. The growth of *B. ignotus* will be moderately inhibited, as lysozyme also functions to chelate essential metal ions required for bacterial metabolism.\n\nE. The growth rate of *B. ignotus* will increase, as the bacterium can metabolize the lysozyme protein as a source of amino acids.", "solution": "We identify the relevant biochemical mechanism of lysozyme and its substrate specificity. Lysozyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the beta-(1,4)-glycosidic bond between N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues in bacterial peptidoglycan. This can be represented enzymatically using Michaelis–Menten kinetics for the substrate peptidoglycan, with reaction velocity\n$$\nv=\\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{M}+[S]},\n$$\nwhere $[S]$ is the concentration of the specific substrate (the beta-(1,4)-linked peptidoglycan). If the microorganism lacks peptidoglycan entirely, then the relevant substrate concentration is $[S]=0$, and therefore\n$$\nv=\\frac{V_{\\max}\\cdot 0}{K_{M}+0}=0,\n$$\nimplying no enzymatic cleavage of the cell envelope by lysozyme.\n\nThe organism described, Bacillus ignotus, has an S-layer and a lipid membrane but no peptidoglycan. Therefore, the specific molecular target of lysozyme is absent, meaning the enzyme cannot exert its canonical lytic effect.\n\nEvaluating alternative claims:\n- The statement that lysozyme is broadly effective against various cell wall polymers is incorrect, because its activity is highly specific to beta-(1,4)-linked peptidoglycan.\n- The claim that lysozyme’s cationic nature alone disrupts membranes under physiological conditions is not supported; lysozyme’s primary antimicrobial mechanism is enzymatic cleavage of peptidoglycan, unlike cationic antimicrobial peptides that disrupt membranes.\n- Lysozyme does not function as a chelator of essential metal ions in a way that would moderately inhibit growth.\n- There is no basis to predict enhanced growth from metabolizing lysozyme as an amino acid source in this context.\n\nTherefore, absence of the specific enzymatic target predicts high resistance to lysozyme’s lytic action.\n\nThe most accurate option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2216287"}, {"introduction": "To successfully establish an infection via the digestive system, a pathogen must survive the chemical gauntlet of the gastrointestinal tract, including the potent detergent action of bile salts. Different pathogens have evolved different strategies and structures to withstand this environment. This exercise [@problem_id:2216294] presents a case study comparing two viruses, challenging you to deduce their fundamental structural differences based on their resilience to bile, a key skill in virology and immunology.", "problem": "A team of virologists is studying two recently discovered viruses, designated V-alpha and V-beta, both of which are transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Transmission through this route requires the virus to survive the harsh environment of the host's gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To investigate their resilience, the team conducts an experiment. Identical concentrations of purified V-alpha and V-beta are placed into two separate solutions. One solution is a standard buffered saline control, and the other is a buffered saline solution containing a physiological concentration of bile salts, mimicking the conditions in the small intestine. After a 30-minute incubation period, the infectivity of the viruses in each of the four samples (V-alpha in control, V-alpha in bile, V-beta in control, V-beta in bile) is assayed on a culture of susceptible host cells.\n\nThe results show that both V-alpha and V-beta retain full infectivity in the control saline solution. However, in the solution containing bile salts, V-alpha loses all detectable infectivity, while V-beta's infectivity remains unchanged.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following is the most definitive conclusion regarding the fundamental structure of these two viruses?\n\nA. V-alpha possesses a lipid envelope, while V-beta is a non-enveloped virus.\n\nB. V-beta possesses a lipid envelope, while V-alpha is a non-enveloped virus.\n\nC. V-alpha has a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) genome, while V-beta has a Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) genome.\n\nD. Both viruses are non-enveloped, but V-alpha has a less robust protein capsid than V-beta.\n\nE. Both viruses are enveloped, but the lipid composition of V-alpha's envelope makes it uniquely susceptible to bile.", "solution": "We analyze the experimental observations using the established principle that viral envelopes are lipid bilayers derived from host membranes, whereas non-enveloped viruses have protein capsids without a lipid bilayer.\n\nFirst, both V-alpha and V-beta retain full infectivity in the control buffered saline. This establishes that, in the absence of detergents or harsh agents, both viruses are stable under the assay conditions, so any differences observed in bile can be attributed to the bile salts.\n\nSecond, bile salts are amphipathic detergents present physiologically in the small intestine. The relevant physical principle is that detergents solubilize lipid bilayers; therefore, enveloped viruses, which depend on an intact lipid envelope for infectivity (including embedded glycoproteins required for attachment and fusion), are typically inactivated by bile salts. In contrast, non-enveloped viruses have robust protein capsids that are resistant to bile salts and other detergents and thus retain infectivity in such conditions.\n\nThird, the observation that V-alpha loses all detectable infectivity in the presence of bile salts indicates that an essential lipid component required for infectivity has been disrupted. The most definitive and parsimonious explanation is that V-alpha is an enveloped virus whose envelope is solubilized by bile salts, leading to loss of infectivity.\n\nFourth, the observation that V-beta’s infectivity remains unchanged in bile salts indicates that its essential structural features are not affected by detergents. The most definitive explanation is that V-beta lacks a lipid envelope and is a non-enveloped (naked) virus with a detergent-resistant protein capsid.\n\nFinally, we rule out alternatives:\n- Option B is the reverse of the above reasoning and contradicts the detergent sensitivity pattern.\n- Option C concerns genome type (DNA versus RNA), which is not determinable from detergent sensitivity; both DNA and RNA viruses can be either enveloped or non-enveloped.\n- Option D suggests both are non-enveloped but differ in capsid robustness; however, non-enveloped viruses are characteristically resistant to bile salts, and complete loss of infectivity specifically in bile strongly implicates an envelope rather than merely a weaker capsid.\n- Option E posits both are enveloped with differential lipid composition; while envelope composition can vary, the most definitive and standard conclusion from complete inactivation by bile versus no effect is the presence versus absence of an envelope.\n\nTherefore, the most definitive conclusion is that V-alpha is enveloped and V-beta is non-enveloped.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2216294"}, {"introduction": "Our constant core body temperature is a subtle yet formidable physiological barrier against infection, as many environmental microbes cannot replicate at $37^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.
