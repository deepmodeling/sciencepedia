By predicting the outcome, you can solidify your knowledge of each component's specific role in activating inflammation.", "problem": "The inflammasome is a large intracellular multi-protein complex that plays a critical role in the innate immune system by activating inflammatory processes. Canonical inflammasome activation in a macrophage, which leads to the maturation of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1β ($\\text{IL-1}\\beta$), generally follows a specific sequence. First, a priming signal, such as a Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP), induces the synthesis of inactive precursor proteins, including pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ and the sensor protein NLRP3. Second, an activation signal, such as a Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), triggers the oligomerization of NLRP3. This sensor then recruits an adaptor protein, which in turn recruits pro-caspase-1, an inactive protease. This recruitment leads to the activation of caspase-1, which then cleaves pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ into its mature, active form for secretion.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered macrophage cell line that possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the adaptor protein known as Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). These cells are exposed to appropriate priming and activation signals that would normally trigger robust NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the direct outcome of the ASC mutation on $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ processing in these cells?\n\nA. The priming signal fails to induce transcription of the gene for pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$, so no precursor is available for processing.\n\nB. Pro-caspase-1 is not recruited to the inflammasome complex and therefore is not activated, preventing the cleavage of pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$.\n\nC. The NLRP3 sensor protein fails to oligomerize in response to the activation signal, halting the assembly of the inflammasome at the initial step.\n\nD. Mature, active $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ is correctly produced but accumulates in the cytoplasm because the ASC protein is also required for its secretion.", "solution": "Step 1: Establish the canonical sequence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. The process requires two signals. The priming signal (e.g., a PAMP via Toll-like receptors and NF-$\\kappa$B activation) induces transcription and translation of precursor proteins, including pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ and the NLRP3 sensor. The activation signal (e.g., a DAMP) causes NLRP3 to oligomerize and recruit an adaptor protein, ASC, which contains a PYD domain to bind NLRP3 and a CARD domain to recruit pro-caspase-1. Proximity-induced autocatalytic activation of caspase-1 follows, which cleaves pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ to mature $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ and cleaves gasdermin D to enable secretion.\n\nStep 2: Define the role of ASC. ASC bridges NLRP3 and pro-caspase-1 through PYD-PYD (with NLRP3) and CARD-CARD (with pro-caspase-1) interactions, forming ASC “specks” that nucleate clustering of pro-caspase-1. This clustering is required for caspase-1 activation and subsequent proteolytic processing of pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$.\n\nStep 3: Predict the effect of ASC loss-of-function. \n- Priming remains intact because ASC is not required for NF-$\\kappa$B–dependent transcription of pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ or NLRP3; thus pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ and NLRP3 can still be synthesized.\n- NLRP3 can still sense activation signals and oligomerize; ASC is downstream of this step.\n- Without functional ASC, pro-caspase-1 cannot be efficiently recruited to the complex, preventing its activation.\n- Consequently, pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ is not cleaved to mature $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$, and gasdermin D is not cleaved, impairing secretion as well.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n- A is incorrect: Priming and transcription of pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ do not require ASC.\n- B is correct: Loss of ASC prevents recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1, thereby preventing cleavage of pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$.\n- C is incorrect: NLRP3 oligomerization is upstream of ASC function and can occur without ASC.\n- D is incorrect: Mature $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ is not produced in the absence of caspase-1 activation; ASC is not a secretion factor per se, and secretion depends on gasdermin D pores generated by caspase-1 activity, which is absent here.\n\nTherefore, the direct outcome of the ASC mutation is failure to recruit and activate pro-caspase-1, preventing the cleavage of pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2255144"}, {"introduction": "The precise control of inflammasome activity is vital for health, and its dysregulation can lead to severe autoinflammatory diseases.

The AIM2 pathway is independent of potassium efflux, while the NLRP3 pathway is largely dependent on it.\n\nD. Inflammasome activation by *L. monocytogenes* is independent of Caspase-1/11 but requires both NLRP3 and AIM2 to function co-dependently.\n\nE. High extracellular KCl enhances inflammasome activation in response to *L. monocytogenes* by stabilizing cytosolic pathogen-derived molecules.", "solution": "The biological principle is that secretion of mature $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ requires inflammasome activation leading to cleavage of pro-$\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ by caspase-1 (and caspase-11 contributes to noncanonical activation in mice). The NLRP3 inflammasome is typically activated by signals such as potassium efflux, which is inhibited by high extracellular KCl. The AIM2 inflammasome senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA and is not dependent on potassium efflux.\n\nDefine the total $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ measured after infection as the sum of a baseline priming output plus contributions from distinct inflammasome pathways:\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}} \\approx I_{0} + I_{\\text{NLRP3}} + I_{\\text{AIM2}}.\n$$\nUninfected controls across all genotypes are low (approximately 4 to 6 pg/mL), establishing $I_{0}$ as small.\n\nIn WT cells, infection yields $I_{\\text{total}} \\approx 1000$, whereas infection in high KCl yields approximately $400$. Since high KCl blocks potassium efflux, the reduction from approximately $1000$ to approximately $400$ indicates that a substantial $K^+$-efflux–dependent component is being suppressed. This identifies $I_{\\text{NLRP3}}$ as the $K^+$-dependent fraction.\n\nIn NLRP3-/- cells, infection yields approximately $410$, which is very close to the WT high KCl value (approximately $400$). This supports that eliminating NLRP3 genetically or blocking its activation by high KCl produces the same residual $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$, attributable to a $K^+$-independent pathway, consistent with AIM2. Thus, $I_{\\text{AIM2}} \\approx 400$.\n\nIn AIM2-/- cells, infection yields approximately $620$, which is reduced relative to WT but higher than the NLRP3-/- residual. This implies a significant NLRP3-dependent contribution remains. Comparing values suggests $I_{\\text{NLRP3}} \\approx 600$ and $I_{\\text{AIM2}} \\approx 400$, consistent with the WT total near $1000$ and the WT high KCl value near $400$ reflecting loss of the NLRP3 component.\n\nIn Casp1/11-/- cells, infection yields approximately $10$, near baseline, demonstrating that maturation and secretion of $\\text{IL-1}\\beta$ is largely abolished without caspase-1/11.
