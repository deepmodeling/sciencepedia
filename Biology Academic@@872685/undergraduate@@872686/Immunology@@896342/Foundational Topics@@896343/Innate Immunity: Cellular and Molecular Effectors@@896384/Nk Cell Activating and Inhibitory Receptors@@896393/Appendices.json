{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly understand how Natural Killer (NK) cells function as sentinels of our immune system, we must first master their fundamental decision-making logic. This initial exercise provides a classic set of scenarios to test your grasp of the core principles: the \"missing-self\" hypothesis, where NK cells target cells lacking inhibitory MHC class I molecules, and the recognition of \"stress-induced self\" via activating ligands [@problem_id:2254863]. By working through these distinct cases, you will build a solid foundation for analyzing the more complex signaling integrations that follow.", "problem": "Natural Killer (NK) cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. Their decision to kill a target cell is governed by a balance of signals received from inhibitory and activating receptors on their surface.\n\nThe signaling logic can be summarized as follows:\n*   **Inhibitory Signal:** NK cell inhibitory receptors bind to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. MHC class I is present on the surface of nearly all healthy, nucleated cells in the body. This binding delivers a potent inhibitory (\"do not kill\") signal.\n*   **Activating Signal:** NK cell activating receptors bind to a family of molecules called \"stress ligands.\" These ligands are generally absent on healthy cells but can be upregulated on cells experiencing stress, such as from viral infection or cancerous transformation. This binding delivers an activating (\"kill\") signal.\n\nAn NK cell will be triggered to kill a target cell if and only if the net signal it receives is activating.\n*   If a strong inhibitory signal from MHC class I binding is present, it will prevent killing, even in the presence of a weak or moderate activating signal.\n*   Killing occurs if a significant activating signal is present in the absence of an inhibitory signal.\n*   Killing can also occur if a very strong activating signal is present that is sufficient to overcome an existing inhibitory signal.\n*   If neither inhibitory nor activating ligands are present on the target cell, the NK cell remains in a neutral, non-cytotoxic state.\n\nGiven this information, in which of the following scenarios is the NK cell most likely to be activated to kill the target cell?\n\nA. The target is a healthy neuron, which expresses normal levels of MHC class I and no stress ligands.\n\nB. The target is a healthy platelet, which is an anucleate cell fragment and therefore expresses neither MHC class I nor stress ligands.\n\nC. The target is a cancerous lymphoma cell that, as a mechanism of immune evasion, has lost all surface expression of MHC class I but expresses a high density of stress ligands.\n\nD. The target is a cell infected with a virus, which has induced the expression of a moderate level of stress ligands while the cell's expression of MHC class I remains normal.", "solution": "Define two nonnegative signal magnitudes received by the NK cell: the inhibitory signal $S_{I}$ (primarily from MHC class I engagement) and the activating signal $S_{A}$ (from stress ligand engagement). The decision rule can be modeled as: killing occurs if and only if the net signal is activating, which we represent as the inequality\n$$\nS_{A} - S_{I} > 0\n$$.\nThis captures the stated logic: a strong inhibitory signal (large $S_{I}$) can prevent killing even with weak or moderate $S_{A}$; absence of inhibitory signal ($S_{I}=0$) allows significant $S_{A}$ to trigger killing; and a very large $S_{A}$ can overcome a nonzero $S_{I}$. If both signals are absent ($S_{A}=0$ and $S_{I}=0$), the NK cell remains in a neutral, non-cytotoxic state.\n\nEvaluate each option:\nA. Healthy neuron with normal MHC class I and no stress ligands: $S_{I}$ is strong (normal MHC class I), $S_{A}\\approx 0$, so $S_{A} - S_{I}  0$; no killing.\nB. Healthy platelet with neither MHC class I nor stress ligands: $S_{I}=0$ and $S_{A}=0$, so $S_{A} - S_{I}=0$; neutral, no killing.\nC. Cancerous lymphoma lacking MHC class I but expressing high-density stress ligands: $S_{I}=0$ and $S_{A}$ is high, so $S_{A} - S_{I} > 0$; killing occurs and is most likely.\nD. Virus-infected cell with moderate stress ligands but normal MHC class I: $S_{I}$ present and significant, $S_{A}$ moderate; given that only a very strong $S_{A}$ can overcome $S_{I}$, we have $S_{A} - S_{I} \\leq 0$; no killing.\n\nTherefore, the NK cell is most likely to be activated to kill in scenario C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2254863"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple \"on\" or \"off\" scenarios, we now explore the more realistic situation where an NK cell receives conflicting instructions simultaneously. This problem presents a target cell expressing ligands for both an activating receptor and an inhibitory receptor, a common occurrence in the body [@problem_id:2254889]. Your task is to predict the outcome by applying the crucial principle of inhibitory signal dominance, a key feature of \"licensed\" NK cells that prevents them from attacking healthy tissue.", "problem": "A Natural Killer (NK) cell from a healthy individual is co-cultured in a laboratory experiment with a population of target cells. The NK cell is known to express two key surface receptors: an inhibitory Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) designated KIR2DL1, and an activating receptor known as Natural Killer Group 2, member D (NKG2D). The target cells are found to express a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I molecule, HLA-C, which is the cognate ligand for KIR2DL1. Due to a mild cellular stress condition induced during the experiment, these same target cells also express MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA), which is a known ligand for the activating receptor NKG2D.\n\nAssuming all receptors and ligands are expressed at functional levels, what is the most likely outcome of the interaction between this specific NK cell and a target cell?\n\nA. The NK cell is activated and induces apoptosis in the target cell, as the activating signal from the NKG2D-MICA interaction is sufficient for cytotoxicity.\n\nB. The NK cell's cytotoxic function is inhibited, and the target cell is spared, because the signal from the KIR2DL1-HLA-C interaction overrides the activating signal.\n\nC. Both the NK cell and the target cell undergo apoptosis due to a phenomenon called \"signal-induced reciprocal killing.\"\n\nD. The NK cell becomes anergic, losing its ability to respond to any subsequent stimuli, but does not kill the initial target cell.\n\nE. The NK cell secretes cytokines that cause the target cell to downregulate its expression of MICA, effectively neutralizing the activation signal.", "solution": "The problem describes a scenario where a Natural Killer (NK) cell encounters a target cell that presents ligands for both an activating and an inhibitory receptor on the NK cell. To determine the outcome, we must understand how NK cells integrate these competing signals.\n\nStep 1: Identify the activating and inhibitory interactions.\nThe problem states two key receptor-ligand pairs are formed between the NK cell and the target cell:\n- **Activating Interaction:** The activating receptor NKG2D on the NK cell binds to its ligand, MICA, on the target cell. This interaction generates a signal that promotes NK cell activation. If this were the only signal, the NK cell would release its cytotoxic granules (containing perforin and granzymes) to kill the target cell.\n- **Inhibitory Interaction:** The inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 on the NK cell binds to its cognate ligand, the HLA-C molecule, on the target cell. This interaction generates an inhibitory signal.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the integration of signals in NK cell function.\nA fundamental principle of NK cell biology is the \"missing-self\" hypothesis, which has been refined into a model of signal integration. NK cells are \"licensed\" or \"educated\" to tolerate healthy self-cells, which express self-MHC class I molecules (HLA in humans). This is achieved through the engagement of inhibitory receptors, such as KIRs, with these HLA molecules. The resulting inhibitory signal is potent and dominant. Its primary function is to block the \"go\" signals that might arise from activating receptors. Activating receptors, like NKG2D, are designed to recognize signs of cellular stress, infection, or transformation (like the expression of MICA).\n\nStep 3: Determine the net outcome.\nIn this scenario, the NK cell receives two conflicting signals: an activation signal from NKG2D-MICA and an inhibitory signal from KIR2DL1-HLA-C. The established hierarchy of NK cell signaling dictates that the inhibitory signal generated by the recognition of a self-HLA class I molecule is dominant. This inhibitory pathway actively counteracts and overrides the downstream signaling cascade initiated by the activating receptor. The inhibitory signal leads to the recruitment of phosphatases (like SHP-1) to the immunological synapse, which dephosphorylate key molecules in the activation pathway, effectively shutting it down.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the fate of the target cell.\nBecause the potent inhibitory signal from the KIR2DL1-HLA-C engagement successfully vetoes the activation signal from the NKG2D-MICA interaction, the NK cell's cytotoxic machinery is not deployed. The NK cell remains in a non-activated state, and the target cell is recognized as \"healthy self\" and is spared from destruction.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A is incorrect because it ignores the dominant role of the inhibitory signal from the KIR-HLA interaction.\n- B is correct because it accurately describes the outcome: the inhibitory signal from KIR2DL1 engagement with HLA-C is dominant, preventing NK cell activation and sparing the target cell.\n- C is incorrect. \"Signal-induced reciprocal killing\" is not a standard immunological term or a recognized outcome in this context.\n- D is incorrect. While repeated or chronic signaling can lead to changes in responsiveness like anergy, it is not the immediate outcome of this single, balanced encounter. The NK cell remains fully functional and ready to survey other cells.\n- E is incorrect. While cytokine feedback loops exist in the immune system, the primary and most immediate outcome of this specific receptor engagement is the inhibition of the NK cell's intrinsic cytotoxic program, not inducing a change in the target cell's protein expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2254889"}, {"introduction": "The final practice exercise bridges the gap between fundamental cell biology and modern therapeutic design. Having established that inhibitory signals can override activating ones, we now consider how this process can be manipulated to fight cancer [@problem_id:2254906]. This problem asks you to analyze the effect of a hypothetical drug that targets a specific molecule, the phosphatase $SHP-1$, within the inhibitory signaling cascade, illustrating a powerful strategy for unleashing the cytotoxic potential of NK cells against tumors.", "problem": "A new immunotherapy strategy is being tested for a specific form of liver cancer. The cancer cells in this disease are characterized by two key features: they maintain a normal surface expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules, but they also anomalously express high levels of ligands that bind to activating receptors on Natural Killer (NK) cells. In a typical immune response, the presence of MHC class I would provide a dominant inhibitory signal to NK cells, preventing them from attacking the tumor.\n\nThe new therapeutic agent is a drug that selectively inhibits the function of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1). SHP-1 is a crucial intracellular enzyme recruited by NK cell inhibitory receptors upon their engagement with MHC class I.\n\nConsidering the specific signaling pathway involved, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of administering this SHP-1 inhibitor to a patient with this particular cancer, focusing on the direct interaction between NK cells and the tumor cells?\n\nA. The drug will have no effect on NK cell activity towards the tumor cells, because the inhibitory receptors are still physically binding to the MHC class I molecules.\n\nB. The drug will lead to the destruction of the tumor cells by NK cells, as the inhibitory signal is biochemically disrupted, allowing the underlying activating signals to proceed.\n\nC. The drug will cause the NK cells to become anergic (non-responsive) due to conflicting and unresolved signals from the activating and inhibitory pathways.\n\nD. The drug will suppress the NK cell anti-tumor response because SHP-1 is also required for the proper function of activating-receptor signaling pathways.\n\nE. The drug will cause healthy liver cells to be attacked by NK cells, but it will have no effect on the tumor cells themselves.", "solution": "NK cells integrate signals from activating and inhibitory receptors. Inhibitory receptors such as KIRs or NKG2A recognize MHC class I on target cells and transmit inhibition through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). Upon engagement, ITIMs become phosphorylated and recruit SHP-1, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates key intermediates in activating pathways, thereby suppressing cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Activating receptors (for example, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46) signal through adaptor molecules such as DAP10 or DAP12 and tyrosine kinases (for example, Syk, ZAP-70), promoting NK cell activation, degranulation, and target cell killing.\n\nIn the described tumor, cancer cells retain normal MHC class I expression (supporting inhibitory receptor engagement) but also express high levels of ligands for activating receptors (providing strong activating input). Under typical conditions, the inhibitory signal delivered via MHC class I engagement and propagated by SHP-1 dominates, preventing NK cell attack despite the presence of activating ligands.\n\nThe therapeutic agent selectively inhibits SHP-1 function. Although inhibitory receptors still physically bind MHC class I and their ITIMs may be phosphorylated, the critical biochemical effector of inhibition—SHP-1—is inactive. This disrupts the inhibitory signaling cascade downstream of inhibitory receptor engagement, removing the dominant brake on NK cell activation. Consequently, the activating signals generated by engagement of the highly expressed activating ligands can proceed effectively, leading to NK cell activation, degranulation, and destruction of the tumor cells.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because physical receptor-ligand binding without functional intracellular signaling via SHP-1 will not effectively transmit inhibition.\n- Option B is correct because SHP-1 inhibition biochemically abrogates the inhibitory pathway, allowing activating signaling to dominate and resulting in NK-mediated tumor cell killing.\n- Option C is incorrect because anergy is not expected from this scenario; rather, relief of inhibition shifts the balance toward activation.\n- Option D is incorrect because SHP-1 is an inhibitory phosphatase and is not required for activating-receptor signaling; its inhibition would not suppress activation.\n- Option E is incorrect because, in this context, tumor cells with high activating ligands become preferential targets; the question focuses on the direct NK-tumor interaction, predicting enhanced tumor cell destruction.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that SHP-1 inhibition will enable NK cells to kill the tumor cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2254906"}]}
