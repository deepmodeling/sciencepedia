These enzymes cleave complement component C3, driving the amplification of the cascade. The classical and lectin pathways assemble the C3 convertase from components C4b and C2a, forming the $C4b2a$ complex. In contrast, the alternative pathway forms its C3 convertase, $C3bBb$, from C3b and Factor Bb.\n\nA key aspect of complement regulation involves controlling the lifespan of these potent enzymes. This is achieved both by dedicated regulatory proteins and by the inherent, or intrinsic, stability of the convertase complexes themselves.\n\nConsidering their intrinsic properties in a purified system without any extrinsic regulatory proteins (such as Factor H, Factor I, or Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF)), which C3 convertase complex exhibits a shorter half-life, indicating greater instability?\n\nA.

It is not possible to determine without knowing if the convertases are in the fluid phase or bound to a cell surface.", "solution": "The stability of C3 convertases is a critical, built-in regulatory feature of the complement system. This intrinsic lability prevents uncontrolled and potentially harmful complement activation. The question asks to compare the intrinsic half-lives of the classical ($C4b2a$) and alternative ($C3bBb$) pathway C3 convertases in the absence of any stabilizing or destabilizing regulatory proteins.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the alternative pathway C3 convertase, $C3bBb$. This complex is formed by the non-covalent association of the large fragment, C3b, and the catalytic serine protease subunit, Bb. This association is notoriously weak and transient. The Bb subunit rapidly and spontaneously dissociates from the C3b, leading to the decay of the convertase. Due to this inherent instability, the intrinsic half-life of the $C3bBb$ complex at physiological temperature (37°C) is very short, typically cited as being approximately 90 seconds. This extreme lability serves as a primary safety mechanism for the alternative pathway, which possesses a powerful positive feedback loop. For the alternative pathway to be effective, this convertase must be stabilized by properdin, which increases its half-life several-fold.\n\nNext, let's consider the classical pathway C3 convertase, $C4b2a$. This complex is formed by the association of C4b (covalently attached to a surface) and the catalytic subunit, C2a. Similar to the alternative pathway convertase, the enzymatic subunit C2a can dissociate, leading to the decay of the complex. However, the non-covalent interactions holding the C2a subunit to the C4b are significantly stronger and more stable than those holding Bb to C3b. Consequently, the spontaneous decay of the $C4b2a$ complex is slower. Its intrinsic half-life at 37°C is approximately 3-5 minutes.\n\nBy comparing the two, the intrinsic half-life of the alternative pathway C3 convertase $C3bBb$ (~90 seconds) is significantly shorter than that of the classical pathway C3 convertase $C4b2a$ (~3-5 minutes). Therefore, the $C3bBb$ complex is intrinsically more unstable.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. The classical pathway C3 convertase ($C4b2a$) has a longer, not shorter, half-life. So, this is incorrect.\nB. The alternative pathway C3 convertase ($C3bBb$) has a shorter half-life due to its weak subunit association. This is the correct statement.\nC. This is incorrect. Although they perform a similar function (cleaving C3), their molecular composition and subunit interactions are different, leading to different intrinsic stabilities. Function does not dictate stability in this case.\nD. This is incorrect. While the exact numerical value of the half-life might vary slightly between a fluid-phase and a surface-bound state, the fundamental relative stability—that $C3bBb$ is inherently much less stable than $C4b2a$—is a core property of the complexes themselves and holds true in either context. The question is about which one is less stable, a relative comparison that can be made.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2264443"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of intrinsic stability, this next exercise explores the quantitative consequences of its disruption. We will analyze a hypothetical gain-of-function mutation that creates a hyper-stable alternative pathway C3 convertase, resistant to normal regulatory mechanisms like Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF). By calculating the resulting increase in complement activation, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how finely tuned molecular kinetics are to preventing complement-mediated pathology [@problem_id:2264464].", "problem": "The alternative pathway of the complement system provides a rapid, antibody-independent defense mechanism against pathogens. A key enzymatic complex in this pathway is the C3 convertase, $C3bBb$, which is assembled on cell surfaces. This enzyme cleaves complement component C3, leading to a powerful amplification loop. To prevent damage to host cells, the activity of $C3bBb$ is tightly regulated.\n\nThe kinetic behavior of the convertase can be described by a total first-order decay constant, $k_{total}$, which is the sum of the intrinsic decay constant, $k_{int}$, and an effective rate constant representing the contribution from regulators like Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF), $k_{DAF\\_cat}$. Thus, $k_{total} = k_{int} + k_{DAF\\_cat}$. The total number of C3 molecules that a single convertase molecule is expected to cleave over its lifetime is inversely proportional to $k_{total}$. In a wild-type (WT) individual, on a host cell surface with physiological DAF concentration, the DAF-catalyzed contribution is dominant, with $k_{DAF\\_cat, WT}$ being nine times greater than $k_{int, WT}$.\n\nA patient presents with a severe complement-mediated pathology due to a gain-of-function mutation in the gene for Factor B. This mutation results in the formation of a hyper-stabilized $C3bBb$ convertase with the following altered kinetic properties:\n1. The intrinsic decay rate constant of the mutant convertase, $k_{int, MUT}$, is reduced to $20.0\\%$ of the wild-type intrinsic decay rate constant, $k_{int, WT}$.\n2. The mutation alters the convertase conformation, reducing its affinity for DAF. Consequently, the effective rate constant from DAF catalysis for the mutant, $k_{DAF\\_cat, MUT}$, is only $10.0\\%$ of the wild-type value, $k_{DAF\\_cat, WT}$.\n\nAssuming the catalytic turnover rate of the convertase for its substrate C3 is unaffected by the mutation, calculate the factor by which the total C3 cleavage potential of a single mutant convertase on a host cell is increased compared to a wild-type convertase.

Genetic sequencing reveals a mutation that results in the complete absence of a functional protectin, also known as CD59, on the surface of their cells.

Protectin (CD59) is a GPI-anchored inhibitor that functions at the terminal pathway of complement activation.

This protective mechanism prevents lytic pore formation on host cell membranes.\n\nIf CD59 is completely absent, the inhibitory checkpoint at the level of MAC assembly is lost. Complement activation up to C5 cleavage proceeds normally, generating C5a and C5b. C5b associates with C6, C7, and C8 on cell membranes, and in the absence of CD59, C9 is free to polymerize, resulting in uncontrolled MAC formation on host cells. This directly causes spontaneous lysis of host cells, particularly erythrocytes, leading to intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because formation and regulation of C3 convertase are primarily controlled by decay-accelerating factor (CD55), factor H, and factor I; CD59 does not inhibit C3 convertase.\n- Option B is incorrect because CD59 acts downstream of C5 cleavage and does not reduce the generation of C3a or C5a.\n- Option C is correct because loss of CD59 permits uncontrolled MAC assembly on host cells, causing their lysis.\n- Option D is incorrect because inhibition of the C1 complex is mediated by C1 esterase inhibitor, not CD59.\n- Option E is incorrect because opsonization with C3b occurs upstream and is not prevented by loss of CD59.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant pathological consequence of the absence of CD59 is uncontrolled MAC formation on host cells with resultant spontaneous lysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2264454"}]}
