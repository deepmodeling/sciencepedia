The cell density, $X$, is maintained at a constant value throughout the experiment. These bacteria are designed to implement a simple quorum sensing system by continuously producing a signaling molecule, known as an autoinducer. Let the concentration of this autoinducer in the culture medium be denoted by $A$.\n\nThe production of the autoinducer occurs at a constant specific rate $\\alpha$ per cell. Simultaneously, the autoinducer molecule undergoes degradation in the medium. This degradation process follows first-order kinetics, characterized by a rate constant $\\delta$.\n\nAssuming the system has been operating long enough to reach a steady state, where the concentration of the autoinducer is no longer changing over time, determine this steady-state concentration of the autoinducer. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the cell density $X$, the specific production rate $\\alpha$, and the degradation rate constant $\\delta$.", "solution": "Let $A(t)$ denote the autoinducer concentration.

The core of their design is a modified quorum sensing (QS) circuit.\n\nThe circuit has the following components and interactions:\n1.  A synthase protein, `Syn`, continuously produces a small, diffusible autoinducer molecule, `AI`.\n2.  `AI` can freely move in and out of the bacterial cells. As the population density increases, the extracellular concentration of `AI` rises.\n3.  Inside the cell, `AI` can bind to a receptor protein, `Rec`, to form an active complex, `$AI\\text{-Rec}$`.\n4.  The `$AI\\text{-Rec}$` complex is a transcriptional activator. It binds to a specific promoter sequence, `P_act`.\n5.  The `P_act` promoter controls the expression of two genes simultaneously.\n    - The first gene codes for a reporter protein, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\n    - The second gene codes for a repressor protein, `Rep`.\n6.  The `Rep` protein functions as a transcriptional repressor. It specifically binds to the promoter region of the gene that codes for the synthase `Syn`, thereby inhibiting the production of `AI`.\n\nAssume that both the `Rep` protein and the `AI` molecule have finite lifetimes and are subject to degradation or diffusion. The system is observed to exhibit sustained oscillations in the expression of GFP when the bacterial culture reaches a sufficient density.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental reason for the oscillatory behavior observed in this system?\n\nA. The repressor protein `Rep` spontaneously switches between an active and an inactive state.\n\nB. The binding of the autoinducer `AI` to the receptor `Rec` is a permanent, irreversible process.\n\nC. The system lacks a mechanism to degrade the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), causing it to accumulate indefinitely.\n\nD. A time delay exists between the `$AI\\text{-Rec}$` complex activating the `Rep` gene and the resulting functional `Rep` protein concentration becoming high enough to inhibit `AI` production.\n\nE. The production rate of the `AI` molecule is exactly equal to its degradation rate at all times.", "solution": "We seek the fundamental dynamical reason the described quorum-sensing negative-feedback circuit exhibits sustained oscillations in GFP expression at sufficient density. The essential architectural feature is a negative feedback loop: the autoinducer $a(t)$ (AI) activates expression of the repressor $r(t)$ (Rep) via the $AI\\text{-}Rec$ complex and promoter $P_{\\text{act}}$, and $r(t)$ represses the synthase that produces $a(t)$. In gene circuits, transcription, translation, folding, and maturation introduce an effective time delay between sensing and the accumulation of functional repressor.\n\nTo formalize this, define $a(t)$ as the intracellular (or well-mixed) AI concentration and $r(t)$ as the Rep concentration. Let $s(r)$ denote the effective AI production rate by the synthase as a decreasing function of $r$ (repression), and let $h(a)$ denote the effective Rep production activation as an increasing function of $a$ (via $AI\\text{-}Rec$ binding and promoter activation).
