They have created a synthetic gene drive system based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology. In this system, there are two alleles for a specific gene locus: the gene drive allele, denoted as $GD$, and the wild-type allele, denoted as $+$.\n\nThe gene drive operates through a process called \"homing\" which occurs in the germline cells of heterozygous individuals ($GD/+$). During gamete formation, the $GD$ allele on one chromosome produces an enzyme that cuts the other chromosome at the site of the wild-type $+$ allele. The cell's repair mechanism then uses the chromosome carrying the $GD$ allele as a template, converting the $+$ allele into a $GD$ allele. In this particular system, the homing process has an efficiency of 90%; that is, in 90% of the cases where a $+$ allele could be converted, it is successfully changed to a $GD$ allele.\n\nConsider a cross between a heterozygous male ($GD/+$) and a wild-type female ($+/+$). Assuming Mendelian segregation for the alleles that do not undergo homing, calculate the expected proportion of the offspring that will inherit the gene drive allele ($GD$). Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let $h$ denote the homing efficiency in the $GD/+$ male germline. In a germline cell:\n- With probability $h$, homing converts the $+$ allele to $GD$, yielding a $GD/GD$ cell that produces only $GD$ gametes, i.e., probability $1$ of a $GD$ gamete.\n- With probability $1-h$, homing fails and the cell remains $GD/+$, producing gametes by Mendelian segregation, i.e., $\\frac{1}{2}$ $GD$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ $+$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a sperm carries $GD$ is\n$$\np_{GD}^{\\text{sperm}}=h\\cdot 1+(1-h)\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{h}{2}=\\frac{1+h}{2}.\n$$\nMating with a $+/+$ female (all eggs are $+$) means the proportion of offspring inheriting $GD$ equals the proportion of paternal gametes carrying $GD$:\n$$\np_{GD}^{\\text{offspring}}=p_{GD}^{\\text{sperm}}=\\frac{1+h}{2}.\n$$\nWith $h=0.9$,\n$$\np_{GD}^{\\text{offspring}}=\\frac{1+0.9}{2}=0.95.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.95}$$", "id": "2072273"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how a gene drive operates at the level of a single family, we now scale up to see its effect on an entire population. This exercise asks you to model the change in allele frequency over a single generation after a small introduction of drive-carrying individuals. Assuming ideal conditions, as this hypothetical scenario does, you will see the remarkable speed at which a gene drive can begin to spread, providing a clear demonstration of its potential for population-wide modification [@problem_id:2072271].", "problem": "A population of diploid organisms is being studied for the potential application of a synthetic gene drive. The population is assumed to be very large and to mate randomly. Initially, the population consists exclusively of individuals homozygous for the wild-type allele, 'w'.\n\nTo test the drive, a group of individuals heterozygous for a synthetic gene drive allele, 'D', are introduced into the population. After they are introduced and have thoroughly mixed with the native population, these heterozygous 'Dw' individuals make up exactly 1.0% of the total breeding population for the first generation. The remaining 99.0% of the breeding population consists of the original wild-type 'ww' individuals.\n\nThe gene drive is designed to be perfectly efficient. This means it has a 100% homing efficiency: in the germline of any 'Dw' heterozygote, the 'w' allele is converted into a 'D' allele, so that the individual produces only 'D' gametes.

This final practice problem challenges you to synthesize these concepts into a powerful predictive model. Instead of just observing an outcome, you will derive the critical threshold—the minimum efficiency a drive must have to overcome a specific fitness cost—that determines whether it can successfully invade a population or is destined to be eliminated by natural selection [@problem_id:2072276].", "problem": "In the study of synthetic gene drives for population control, a key challenge is the evolution of resistance. Consider a simplified model of a large, diploid, randomly mating population. At a specific gene locus, there are three possible alleles: the wild-type allele ($W$), a synthetic gene drive allele ($D$), and a non-functional resistant allele ($R$).\n\nThe gene drive mechanism is based on homing. In any individual that is heterozygous for the drive and wild-type alleles ($WD$), the drive machinery on the chromosome carrying $D$ targets and cuts the corresponding locus on the chromosome carrying $W$. The cell's repair machinery then uses the $D$-carrying chromosome as a template. This process is imperfect and has two outcomes:\n1.  **Homing**: The $W$ allele is successfully converted into a $D$ allele. This occurs with a probability $e_h$ for each $W$ allele in a $WD$ heterozygote's germline.\n2.  **Resistance Formation**: The cut is repaired incorrectly by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), which creates the non-functional allele $R$. This allele is resistant to subsequent cutting by the drive. This occurs with a probability $e_r$.\nIf neither of these events occurs (with probability $1-e_h-e_r$), the $W$ allele is passed on unaltered. Inheritance in all other genotypes follows standard Mendelian rules.\n\nThe synthetic construct of the drive allele imposes a dominant fitness cost. Any individual carrying at least one $D$ allele (genotypes $WD$, $DD$, or $DR$) has a relative fitness of $1-c$, where $0 < c < 1$. All other genotypes ($WW$, $WR$, and $RR$) are assumed to have a relative fitness of 1.\n\nThe drive system is introduced by releasing a small number of individuals carrying the $D$ allele into a population that is otherwise entirely wild-type. For the drive to be successful and spread, the total frequency of non-wild-type alleles ($D$ and $R$) must increase from this initial introduction. There is a critical threshold for the total conversion efficiency, defined as $C_{eff} = e_h + e_r$, below which the drive and any resulting resistant alleles are eliminated by selection.\n\nFind the analytical expression for this minimum threshold value of $C_{eff}$.", "solution": "Let $w_{t}$, $p_{t}$, and $r_{t}$ denote the allele frequencies of $W$, $D$, and $R$ at generation $t$, with $w_{t}+p_{t}+r_{t}=1$.

Thus, after selection the unnormalized frequencies are\n$$\nf_{WW}^{s}\\approx 1-2p_{t},\\qquad f_{WD}^{s}\\approx 2p_{t}(1-c).\n$$\nThe mean fitness is\n$$\n\\bar{w}=(1-2p_{t})+2p_{t}(1-c)=1-2p_{t}c.\n$$\nTherefore, the fraction of $WD$ among adults (post-selection, pre-gamete) is\n$$\n\\frac{f_{WD}^{s}}{\\bar{w}}=\\frac{2p_{t}(1-c)}{1-2p_{t}c}=2p_{t}(1-c)\\left(1+2p_{t}c+\\mathcal{O}(p_{t}^{2})\\right)\\approx 2p_{t}(1-c),\n$$\nto first order in $p_{t}$.\n\nIn a $WD$ germline, the $W$ allele is converted before meiosis: to $D$ with probability $e_{h}$, to $R$ with probability $e_{r}$, or remains $W$ with probability $1-e_{h}-e_{r}$. Thus a $WD$ adult produces gametes with allele probabilities obtained by conditioning on the pre-meiotic genotype:\n- With probability $e_{h}$ the germline cell is $DD$ and yields only $D$ gametes.\n- With probability $e_{r}$ the germline cell is $DR$ and yields $D$ and $R$ gametes in equal proportions.\n- With probability $1-e_{h}-e_{r}$ the germline cell is $WD$ and yields $W$ and $D$ gametes in equal proportions.\n\nHence, the gamete allele probabilities from a $WD$ adult are\n$$\n\\Pr(D)=e_{h}\\cdot 1+e_{r}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}+(1-e_{h}-e_{r})\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1+e_{h}}{2},\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(R)=e_{r}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2},\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(W)=(1-e_{h}-e_{r})\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nWW adults produce only $W$ gametes.\n\nLet $G_{D}$ and $G_{R}$ be the frequencies of $D$ and $R$ in the gamete pool.
