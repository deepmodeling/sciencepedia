{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The genetic code's redundancy, where multiple codons specify the same amino acid, is not functionally equivalent from a biological perspective. Cells often fine-tune the abundance of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to match the usage frequency of their corresponding codons, a phenomenon known as codon usage bias, which optimizes translational efficiency. This first exercise [@problem_id:2079126] explores the critical consequences of disrupting this evolved balance, presenting a common scenario where a large-scale recoding effort creates a bottleneck in protein synthesis, and challenges you to diagnose the problem and propose a logical genetic fix.", "problem": "In synthetic biology, whole-genome recoding is a technique used to alter an organism's genetic code, often to introduce new functionalities or to create genetic firewalls. Consider a hypothetical experiment where a strain of the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is created. In this synthetic strain, every single instance of the codon UAC, which codes for the amino acid Tyrosine, has been replaced with the synonymous codon UAU, which also codes for Tyrosine. The transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA) that recognizes the UAC codon has the anticodon GUA, while the tRNA that recognizes the UAU codon has the anticodon AUA.\n\nIn wild-type yeast, the UAC codon is used significantly more often than the UAU codon to specify Tyrosine. Consequently, the cellular concentration of the tRNA with the GUA anticodon is much higher than that of the tRNA with the AUA anticodon. Upon creating the fully recoded UAC-to-UAU strain, investigators observe that it grows much more slowly than the wild-type strain.\n\nBased on the principles of protein translation, which of the following single genetic modifications is most likely to rescue the growth rate of this recoded yeast strain?\n\nA. Overexpress the gene encoding the tRNA with the anticodon AUA.\n\nB. Delete the gene encoding the tRNA with the anticodon GUA.\n\nC. Overexpress the gene encoding the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the enzyme that attaches Tyrosine to all Tyrosine-tRNAs.\n\nD. Overexpress the gene encoding a tRNA that recognizes a Leucine codon.\n\nE. Introduce mutations in ribosomal proteins to globally decrease the fidelity of codon-anticodon pairing.", "solution": "The problem describes a synthetic yeast strain where all UAC codons (for Tyrosine) have been replaced by the synonymous UAU codon. This strain exhibits slow growth. We need to identify the most likely genetic modification to restore a normal growth rate.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the core problem.\nThe central dogma of molecular biology states that codons on a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript are read by ribosomes, and corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, carrying specific amino acids, bind to these codons. The efficiency of this process, called translation, is critical for protein synthesis and, by extension, for cell growth.\n\nStep 2: Understand the concept of codon usage bias and tRNA abundance.\nOrganisms do not use all synonymous codons with equal frequency. This phenomenon is known as codon usage bias. The cellular abundance of different tRNA species (isoacceptors) is often correlated with the frequency of their corresponding codons. A frequently used codon is typically decoded by a more abundant tRNA, leading to faster and more efficient translation.\n\nStep 3: Apply the concepts to the specific scenario.\nIn wild-type yeast, the UAC codon for Tyrosine is used more frequently than UAU. This implies that the cell maintains a higher concentration of the tRNA that recognizes UAC (the one with the GUA anticodon) and a lower concentration of the tRNA that recognizes UAU (the one with the AUA anticodon).\n\nIn the recoded strain, the situation is reversed. Every Tyrosine in every protein must now be encoded by a UAU codon. This creates a massive demand for the tRNA with the AUA anticodon, which is naturally scarce. The ribosomes will frequently pause at UAU codons, waiting for a rare AUA-tRNA to become available. This stalling effect drastically slows down overall protein synthesis, leading to the observed slow growth phenotype. The fundamental issue is a supply-demand mismatch: high demand for a low-supply resource (the AUA-tRNA).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the proposed modifications.\n\nA. Overexpress the gene encoding the tRNA with the anticodon AUA.\nThis modification directly addresses the bottleneck. By increasing the transcription of the gene for the AUA-tRNA, the cellular concentration of this specific tRNA will rise. With a larger pool of AUA-tRNAs available, ribosomes will no longer have to wait as long at UAU codons. This will speed up translation, increase the rate of protein synthesis, and is therefore very likely to rescue the growth rate.\n\nB. Delete the gene encoding the tRNA with the anticodon GUA.\nThe GUA-tRNA recognizes the UAC codon, which is no longer present in the genome of the recoded strain. Deleting this now-obsolete tRNA might free up some cellular resources involved in its synthesis. However, it does nothing to alleviate the shortage of the AUA-tRNA, which is the direct cause of the slow growth. Therefore, this modification would not solve the problem.\n\nC. Overexpress the gene encoding the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase.\nThis enzyme is responsible for \"charging\" all Tyrosine-tRNAs (both GUA- and AUA-anticodon species) by attaching a Tyrosine molecule to them. While having properly charged tRNAs is essential for translation, the primary bottleneck in this scenario is the physical scarcity of the AUA-tRNA molecule itself, not the process of charging it. Increasing the amount of synthetase will not create more AUA-tRNA molecules. The factory is waiting for more trucks (tRNA), not for a faster way to load the few trucks that are available. So, this is not the most effective solution.\n\nD. Overexpress the gene encoding a tRNA that recognizes a Leucine codon.\nThis modification is irrelevant to the problem at hand. The issue is with the translation of Tyrosine codons, and changing the abundance of a tRNA for a completely different amino acid (Leucine) will not resolve the Tyrosine-specific bottleneck.\n\nE. Introduce mutations in ribosomal proteins to globally decrease the fidelity of codon-anticodon pairing.\nDecreasing the fidelity, or \"proofreading\" accuracy, of the ribosome might allow other, non-cognate tRNAs (or perhaps even the abundant GUA-tRNA) to occasionally misread the UAU codon. However, this is a highly detrimental strategy. It would lead to widespread errors in protein synthesis (mistranslation) for all codons, not just UAU. The resulting non-functional or misfolded proteins would likely be toxic to the cell, further inhibiting growth or even causing cell death. This is the opposite of a rescue strategy.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and logical solution to the problem of a high demand for a scarce tRNA is to increase the supply of that specific tRNA. Therefore, overexpressing the gene for the tRNA with the AUA anticodon is the correct strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2079126"}, {"introduction": "Genome-scale engineering is far too complex for simple trial and error.

Their goal is to reassign the UAG stop codon to a non-canonical amino acid, which requires replacing all native UAG codons with a different stop codon, UAA. This change involves a single G-to-A mutation at the third position of the codon. To prioritize which genes to recode first, they have developed a \"Recodability Index\" ($I_R$) to quantify the potential risks versus benefits of recoding a particular gene.\n\nThe Recodability Index for a gene is defined by the following formula:\n$$I_R = C N - \\alpha M - \\beta |\\Delta G_{\\text{final}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{initial}}|$$\nwhere:\n- $N$ is the total number of UAG codons recoded to UAA within the gene.\n- $M$ is the total count of recoded codons where the G-to-A mutation site coincides with a known \"sensitive site\". Sensitive sites are single-nucleotide positions critical for other functions, like protein binding or transcriptional regulation.\n- $\\Delta G_{\\text{initial}}$ is the initial Gibbs free energy of folding for a critical regulatory secondary structure in the gene's Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA).\n- $\\Delta G_{\\text{final}}$ is the predicted free energy of the same structure after recoding.\n- $C$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$ are weighting constants, defined such that $I_R$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nYou are tasked with calculating the Recodability Index for the hypothetical gene `regX`. The relevant data are provided below:\n- The coding sequence of `regX` contains UAG codons starting at nucleotide positions (1-based indexing): 112, 250, 433, and 580.\n- A list of known sensitive sites within the `regX` gene are located at positions: 88, 114, 301, 430, 435, and 510.\n- The `regX` mRNA contains a critical hairpin loop formed by nucleotides 421 through 450. The initial stability of this structure is $\\Delta G_{\\text{initial}} = -15.2 \\text{ kcal/mol}$.\n- Biophysical modeling predicts that each G-to-A mutation that occurs within this hairpin loop region (positions 421-450) increases the folding free energy by $\\delta G_A = +1.8 \\text{ kcal/mol}$.

The problem states that UAG codons are located starting at positions 112, 250, 433, and 580. This gives a total of 4 UAG codons.\n$$N = 4$$\nThe first term, the baseline benefit, is $C N$. With $C = 100$, this term is:\n$$C N = 100 \\times 4 = 400$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the overlap penalty term, $\\alpha M$. This requires finding $M$, the number of mutation sites that are also sensitive sites. The recoding of a UAG codon to UAA is a G-to-A mutation at the third position of the codon. Given the starting positions of the UAG codons (112, 250, 433, 580), the mutation sites are at positions $112+2=114$, $250+2=252$, $433+2=435$, and $580+2=582$.\nThe set of mutation sites is $\\{114, 252, 435, 582\\}$.\nThe set of sensitive sites is given as $\\{88, 114, 301, 430, 435, 510\\}$.\nTo find $M$, we find the number of elements in the intersection of these two sets.\nThe common sites are 114 and 435.\nThus, the number of overlaps is $M = 2$.\nThe overlap penalty term is $\\alpha M$. With $\\alpha = 145$, this term is:\n$$\\alpha M = 145 \\times 2 = 290$$\n\nThird, we calculate the structural disruption penalty, $\\beta |\\Delta G_{\\text{final}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{initial}}|$. We first need to find the change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{final}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{initial}}$.

Each such mutation increases the free energy by $\\delta G_A = +1.8$ kcal/mol. Therefore, the total change in free energy is:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{final}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{initial}} = 1 \\times \\delta G_A = 1.8 \\text{ kcal/mol}$$\nThe absolute value of this change is $|\\Delta G_{\\text{final}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{initial}}| = 1.8$ kcal/mol.\nThe structural penalty term is $\\beta |\\Delta G_{\\text{final}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{initial}}|$.
