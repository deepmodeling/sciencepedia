A common circuit motif is the band-pass filter, which activates an output gene only within a specific range of concentrations of an input signal molecule.\n\nConsider a synthetic genetic circuit in a bacterium designed to function as a band-pass filter. The circuit consists of the following components:\n1.  **Input Signal ($S$):** A small molecule that can be added to the cell's environment.\n2.  **Activator Protein ($A$):** The production of this protein is turned ON by the input signal $S$. The dose-response is sigmoidal, with a half-maximal activation constant $K_A$.\n3.  **Repressor Protein ($R$):** The production of this protein is also turned ON by the input signal $S$. Its dose-response is also sigmoidal, but it is designed to be less sensitive than the activator's. It has a half-maximal activation constant $K_R$, where $K_R$ is significantly greater than $K_A$.\n4.  **Output Protein ($P$):** A reporter protein, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), whose production is controlled by a special promoter. This promoter is dually regulated: it is strongly activated by the activator protein $A$ and strongly repressed by the repressor protein $R$. For the output protein $P$ to be produced, protein $A$ must be present to activate the promoter, and protein $R$ must be absent (or at a very low concentration) to avoid repression.\n\nThis design results in a band-pass filter: at low concentrations of $S$ (below $K_A$), neither $A$ nor $R$ is produced, so the output $P$ is OFF. At intermediate concentrations of $S$ (above $K_A$ but below $K_R$), $A$ is produced but $R$ is not, so the output $P$ is ON. At high concentrations of $S$ (above $K_R$), both $A$ and $R$ are produced, and the strong repression by $R$ turns the output $P$ OFF.\n\nNow, imagine a related experiment where a student uses a bacterial strain containing a modified version of this circuit. In this new strain, the gene encoding the repressor protein $R$ has been completely deleted. As a result, the repressor protein $R$ cannot be produced under any circumstances.\n\nHow does this modification alter the relationship between the concentration of the input signal $S$ and the steady-state level of the output protein $P$? Choose the option that best describes the new behavior of the circuit.\n\nA. The circuit now functions as a **low-pass filter**: The output $P$ is produced at high levels for low concentrations of $S$ and is turned off for high concentrations of $S$.\n\nB. The circuit now functions as a **high-pass filter**: The output $P$ is produced at high levels only when the concentration of $S$ is above a certain threshold; it is turned off for concentrations below this threshold.\n\nC. The circuit is constitutively **OFF**: The output $P$ is not produced, regardless of the concentration of $S$.\n\nD. The circuit is constitutively **ON**: The output $P$ is produced at a high level, regardless of the concentration of $S$.\n\nE.

The circuit is designed to produce a reporter protein, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), only when the concentration of a specific small molecule inducer, let's call it molecule $S$, is within a particular range.\n\nThe architecture of the circuit is a Type 1 Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (I-FFL), and its mechanism is as follows:\n1. The inducer molecule $S$ binds to and allosterically activates a transcriptional activator protein, $A$. The activator $A$ itself is produced at a constant level within the cell.\n2. The active $S$-$A$ complex promotes transcription from two different promoters:\n    a. Promoter $P_R$, which drives the expression of a repressor protein, $R$.\n    b. Promoter $P_G$, which drives the expression of the output protein, GFP.\n3. The repressor protein $R$, once synthesized, can bind to an operator site located within the promoter $P_G$, thereby inhibiting the transcription of GFP.\n\nThis network topology results in the following overall behavior:\n- At low concentrations of $S$, the activator $A$ is not active, so neither $R$ nor GFP is produced. The fluorescent output is OFF.\n- At intermediate concentrations of $S$, the $S$-$A$ complex activates the expression of GFP. Although $R$ is also being produced, its concentration is not yet sufficient to cause significant repression of $P_G$. The fluorescent output is ON.\n- At high concentrations of $S$, a large amount of repressor $R$ is synthesized. This high concentration of $R$ leads to strong binding at the operator site on $P_G$, effectively shutting down GFP production. The fluorescent output is OFF again.\n\nThe range of inducer concentrations $[S]$ for which the GFP output is ON is known as the operational band. The binding strength of the repressor $R$ to its operator site on promoter $P_G$ is quantified by the dissociation constant, $K_D$. A smaller value of $K_D$ indicates stronger binding (higher affinity).\n\nTo broaden the operational band of this circuit, meaning to make the circuit produce GFP over a wider range of inducer concentrations $[S]$, how should the dissociation constant $K_D$ of the repressor for its operator site be altered?\n\nA. $K_D$ should be increased.\n\nB. $K_D$ should be decreased.\n\nC. The expression of the repressor gene should be completely removed from the circuit.\n\nD. $K_D$ has no effect on the band width.\n\nE. $K_D$ should be engineered to be exactly equal to the dissociation constant of the inducer $S$ for the activator protein $A$.", "solution": "Let $S$ bind and activate $A$ to form $A^{*}(S)$, which increases monotonically with $[S]$. A convenient symbolic representation is to let $A^{*}(S)$ be a monotone increasing function of $S$ (e.g., a Hill function), but we keep it abstract and denote it $A^{*}(S)$.\n\nActivation of GFP from promoter $P_{G}$ by $A^{*}$ can be represented by a Hill-type activation function, and repression by $R$ binding to the operator in $P_{G}$ can be represented by a Hill-type repression function with dissociation constant $K_{D}$. At steady state, the GFP output can be written as\n$$\nY(S)=\\alpha\\,\\underbrace{\\frac{\\left(A^{*}(S)/K_{AG}\\right)^{n_{a}}}{1+\\left(A^{*}(S)/K_{AG}\\right)^{n_{a}}}}_{\\text{activation by }A^{*}}\n\\cdot\n\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{1+\\left(R(S)/K_{D}\\right)^{n_{r}}}}_{\\text{repression by }R},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$, $K_{AG}$, $n_{a}$, $n_{r}$ are positive constants, and $R(S)$ is the steady-state repressor concentration induced by $A^{*}(S)$ via promoter $P_{R}$. Since $P_{R}$ is activated by the same $A^{*}(S)$, $R(S)$ is a monotone increasing function of $S$ (e.g., a Hill function):\n$$\nR(S)=\\beta\\,\\frac{\\left(A^{*}(S)/K_{AR}\\right)^{m}}{1+\\left(A^{*}(S)/K_{AR}\\right)^{m}},\n$$\nwith $\\beta$, $K_{AR}$, $m$ positive constants.\n\nBand-pass behavior arises because:\n- At low $S$, $A^{*}(S)$ is small, so the activation term is small and $Y(S)$ is OFF.\n- At intermediate $S$, $A^{*}(S)$ is large enough to activate $P_{G}$, while $R(S)$ remains not large enough to significantly repress, so $Y(S)$ is ON.\n- At high $S$, $R(S)$ becomes large, making $\\left(R(S)/K_{D}\\right)^{n_{r}} \\gg 1$, which reduces $Y(S)$ to OFF.\n\nDefine the lower and upper edges of the operational band by the conditions that turn ON activation and turn ON repression, respectively. The lower edge $S_{\\text{low}}$ is determined by activation and is set by when $A^{*}(S)$ becomes comparable to $K_{AG}$; it does not depend on $K_{D}$. The upper edge $S_{\\text{high}}$ is determined by repression and can be approximated by the condition that repression becomes strong, i.e.,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{R(S_{\\text{high}})}{K_{D}}\\right)^{n_{r}} \\approx 1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad R(S_{\\text{high}})\\approx K_{D}.\n$$\nSince $R(S)$ is a monotone increasing function of $S$, this defines $S_{\\text{high}}$ implicitly as\n$$\nS_{\\text{high}}=R^{-1}(K_{D}).\n$$\nDifferentiate implicitly with respect to $K_{D}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS_{\\text{high}}}{dK_{D}}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{dR}{dS}(S_{\\text{high}})}.\n$$\nBecause $\\frac{dR}{dS}(S)0$ for all relevant $S$, it follows that\n$$\n\\frac{dS_{\\text{high}}}{dK_{D}}0.\n$$\nTherefore, increasing $K_{D}$ shifts the upper cutoff $S_{\\text{high}}$ to larger $S$, while $S_{\\text{low}}$ remains essentially unchanged. Consequently, the operational band width increases when $K_{D}$ is increased, provided that the maximal achievable $R$ still satisfies $R_{\\max}\\gg K_{D}$ so that repression can occur at sufficiently high $S$ (this condition preserves band-pass behavior rather than eliminating the OFF state at high $S$).\n\nBy contrast:\n- Decreasing $K_{D}$ makes repression occur at lower $S$, reducing $S_{\\text{high}}$ and narrowing the band.\n- Removing the repressor eliminates the incoherent arm and destroys the band-pass, yielding a monotonic ON response.\n- Claiming $K_{D}$ has no effect contradicts the dependence of $S_{\\text{high}}$ on $K_{D}$.\n- Matching $K_{D}$ to the dissociation constant of $S$ for $A$ has no general theoretical basis for optimizing band width.\n\nThus, to broaden the operational band, $K_{D}$ should be increased.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2020741"}, {"introduction": "To move from qualitative design principles to quantitative engineering, we must use mathematical models to describe and predict circuit behavior.
