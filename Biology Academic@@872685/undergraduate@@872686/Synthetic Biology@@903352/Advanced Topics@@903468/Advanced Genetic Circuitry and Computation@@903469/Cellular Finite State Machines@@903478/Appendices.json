Consider an engineered bacterium whose motility is controlled by an optogenetic switch, a system that uses light to control gene expression. The behavior of this bacterium can be modeled as a discrete-time Finite State Machine (FSM), a mathematical model of computation with a finite number of states.\n\nThe system is characterized by a single binary input, Blue Light ($L$), where $L=1$ indicates the light is ON and $L=0$ indicates the light is OFF. The state of the bacterium is described by one of four possibilities:\n- $S_0$: Motile and Responsive. The cell is actively moving and can react to the light stimulus.\n- $S_1$: Sessile and Responsive. The cell is stationary, attached to a surface, and can react to the light stimulus.\n- $S_2$: Motile and Refractory. The cell is moving but is in a one-time-step cooldown period, during which it cannot react to light.\n- $S_3$: Sessile and Refractory. The cell is stationary but is in a one-time-step cooldown period, during which it cannot react to light.\n\nThe state transitions at each time step, from time $t$ to $t+1$, are governed by the following rules:\n1.  If the cell is in a Responsive state ($S_0$ or $S_1$) at time $t$ and the light is ON ($L(t)=1$), it toggles its phenotype (Motile $\\leftrightarrow$ Sessile) and enters the corresponding Refractory state at time $t+1$. Specifically, a state of $S_0$ transitions to $S_3$, and a state of $S_1$ transitions to $S_2$.\n2.  If the cell is in a Responsive state ($S_0$ or $S_1$) at time $t$ and the light is OFF ($L(t)=0$), its state does not change. The state at $t+1$ is the same as the state at $t$.\n3.  If the cell is in a Refractory state ($S_2$ or $S_3$) at time $t$, it transitions to its corresponding Responsive state ($S_2 \\rightarrow S_0$, $S_3 \\rightarrow S_1$) at time $t+1$, regardless of the light input $L(t)$.\n\nSuppose a bacterium is in state $S_1$ (Sessile and Responsive) at time $t=0$.

The engineered cell is designed to produce a specific reporter protein only after it is exposed to three different chemical inducers in a precise, predefined sequence. If the inducers are added out of order, the cell must enter a permanent, irreversible failure state from which it cannot recover to produce the reporter.\n\nThe system has the following components:\n- **States**: The cell can exist in one of five states:\n    - `S0`: The initial \"locked\" ground state.\n    - `S1`: The state after receiving the first correct inducer.\n    - `S2`: The state after receiving the second correct inducer.\n    - `S3`: The final \"unlocked\" state where the reporter protein is produced. This state is a latch, meaning once entered, the cell remains in this state indefinitely.\n    - `SF`: An irreversible \"failure\" state. Once entered, the cell remains in this state indefinitely.\n\n- **Inputs**: At any given time, the cell is exposed to one of four possible input conditions:\n    - `A`: Presence of Arabinose only.\n    - `T`: Presence of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) only.\n    - `I`: Presence of Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) only.\n    - `N`: Absence of any inducer.\n\n- **Logic**:\n    1. The required sequence to reach the unlocked state `S3` is Arabinose (`A`), followed by aTc (`T`), followed by IPTG (`I`).\n    2. The cell starts in state `S0`.\n    3. Exposure to an incorrect inducer at any stage before reaching `S3` sends the cell to the failure state `SF`.\n    4. If the cell is in a correct intermediate state (`S1` or `S2`) and the inducer is removed (input `N`), or if it is re-exposed to a previous correct inducer, it should maintain its current state, waiting for the next correct signal in the sequence.\n\nYour task is to determine the correct state transition table for this cellular FSM.

We will analyze the required transitions from each state one by one. The `any` input condition for states `S3` and `SF` refers to any of the possible inputs: `A`, `T`, `I`, or `N`.\n\n**State S0 (Initial State):**\nThe cell starts in `S0`. The correct first input is Arabinose (`A`).\n- If the input is `A`, the cell should transition to `S1`. So, `(S0, A) -> S1`.\n- Any other inducer, `T` or `I`, is an incorrect first input. This should send the cell to the failure state `SF`. So, `(S0, T) -> SF` and `(S0, I) -> SF`.\n- If no inducer is present (input `N`), the cell remains in its initial state. So, `(S0, N) -> S0`.\nThe transitions from `S0` are: `(S0, A) -> S1`, `(S0, T) -> SF`, `(S0, I) -> SF`, `(S0, N) -> S0`.\n\n**State S1 (First Correct Input Received):**\nThe cell is in `S1` after correctly processing input `A`. The correct next input is aTc (`T`).\n- If the input is `T`, the cell should transition to `S2`. So, `(S1, T) -> S2`.\n- The input `I` is incorrect at this stage. This should send the cell to the failure state `SF`. So, `(S1, I) -> SF`.\n- According to the rules, if the cell is re-exposed to a previous correct inducer (`A`) or if the inducer is removed (`N`), it should maintain its current state. So, `(S1, A) -> S1` and `(S1, N) -> S1`.\nThe transitions from `S1` are: `(S1, T) -> S2`, `(S1, I) -> SF`, `(S1, A) -> S1`, `(S1, N) -> S1`.\n\n**State S2 (Second Correct Input Received):**\nThe cell is in `S2` after correctly processing the sequence `A` then `T`. The correct final input is IPTG (`I`).\n- If the input is `I`, the cell completes the sequence and transitions to the unlocked state `S3`. So, `(S2, I) -> S3`.\n- Re-exposure to previous correct inducers (`A` or `T`) or removal of the inducer (`N`) should cause the cell to maintain its state. So, `(S2, A) -> S2`, `(S2, T) -> S2`, and `(S2, N) -> S2`. Note that exposure to `A` is an incorrect input at this stage in the sequence, but the rule for maintaining state upon exposure to *previous correct* inducers is specified. If we were to interpret \"incorrect inducer\" strictly, `(S2, A) -> SF` would also be a valid design, but rule 4 guides us to `(S2, A) -> S2`. Let's re-examine the options based on this. All options that are close to correct, like A and D, use `(S2, A) -> S2` and `(S2, T) -> S2`. This confirms the interpretation that the cell should \"hold\" its state when re-exposed to previous signals in the sequence.\nThe transitions from `S2` are: `(S2, I) -> S3`, `(S2, A) -> S2`, `(S2, T) -> S2`, `(S2, N) -> S2`.\n\n**State S3 (Unlocked State):**\nThe problem states that `S3` is a \"latch\" state, meaning once entered, the cell remains there indefinitely.\n- Therefore, for any input (`A`, `T`, `I`, or `N`), the cell stays in `S3`. We can write this as `(S3, any) -> S3`.\n\n**State SF (Failure State):**\nThe problem states that `SF` is an \"irreversible\" failure state. Once entered, the cell remains there indefinitely.\n- Therefore, for any input (`A`, `T`, `I`, or `N`), the cell stays in `SF`. We can write this as `(SF, any) -> SF`.\n\n**Comparing with the Options:**\nLet's assemble our derived transition table and compare it with the given options.\n- Our derived table:\n    - `(S0, A) -> S1`, `(S0, T) -> SF`, `(S0, I) -> SF`, `(S0, N) -> S0`\n    - `(S1, T) -> S2`, `(S1, I) -> SF`, `(S1, A) -> S1`, `(S1, N) -> S1`\n    - `(S2, I) -> S3`, `(S2, A) -> S2`, `(S2, T) -> S2`, `(S2, N) -> S2`\n    - `(S3, any) -> S3`, `(SF, any) -> SF`\n\n- **Option A:** This matches our derived table exactly.\n- **Option B:** This option incorrectly resets the state to `S0` on incorrect inputs `(S1, I) -> S0` or upon removal of the inducer `(S1, N) -> S0`, which violates rule 4 and the requirement for a permanent failure state. It also incorrectly shows the failure state `SF` as being reversible `(SF, N) -> S0`.\n- **Option C:** This option incorrectly assumes any inducer can start the sequence (`(S0, T) -> S1`, `(S0, I) -> S1`), violating the specific sequence requirement.\n- **Option D:** This option has the wrong sequence of inducers after the first step. It requires `I` then `T` (`(S1, I) -> S2` then `(S2, T) -> S3`), which contradicts the required sequence of `A -> T -> I`.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly models the specified cellular FSM is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2025697"}, {"introduction": "This final practice connects the abstract FSM model to its concrete biological implementation in a genetic toggle switch.

This switch is implemented in a bacterium and consists of two genes, Gene 1 and Gene 2, which produce Repressor protein 1 ($R_1$) and Repressor protein 2 ($R_2$), respectively. These two repressors mutually inhibit each other's expression: $R_1$ represses Gene 2, and $R_2$ represses Gene 1.\n\nThe state of this cellular system can be modeled as a discrete Finite State Machine (FSM). The state at any time $t$ is described by an ordered pair of protein concentration levels, $(C_1, C_2)$, where $C_1$ is the level of $R_1$ and $C_2$ is the level of $R_2$. The levels can be either Low (`L`) or High (`H`).\n\nThe system transitions from a state at time $t$ to a new state at time $t+1$ based on the following rules:\n1.  The concentration level of a protein at time $t+1$ will be `H` if its corresponding gene was 'Active' at time $t$.\n2.  The concentration level of a protein at time $t+1$ will be `L` if its corresponding gene was 'Inactive' at time $t$.\n3.

A gene is 'Inactive' if the concentration level of the repressor that targets it is `H`.\n\nA stable state is defined as a state $(C_1, C_2)$ which does not change over time, i.e., $(C_1(t+1), C_2(t+1)) = (C_1(t), C_2(t))$.\n\nThe biologist studies two strains of this bacterium:\n-   **Wild-Type (WT) Strain**: This strain contains the standard toggle switch described above.\n-   **Mutant Strain**: A point mutation has occurred in Gene 1, resulting in a mutant repressor protein, $R_1^*$. This mutation confers a new functionality to the protein while destroying the old one. The rules for the Mutant Strain are as follows:\n    -   $R_1^*$ has completely lost its ability to repress Gene 2. Gene 2 is therefore *always* 'Active' in this strain, regardless of the level of $R_1^*$.\n    -   $R_1^*$ has gained a new function: when its concentration level is `H`, it binds to and completely inactivates the $R_2$ protein. This means that if the level of $R_1^*$ is `H`, the effective concentration of $R_2$ for repressing Gene 1 is `L`, even if the total amount of $R_2$ is `H`. The repression of Gene 1 by $R_2$ only occurs if the level of $R_2$ is `H` *and* the level of $R_1^*$ is `L`.\n\nThe biologist also investigates the effect of a small-molecule inhibitor, denoted by `I`. This inhibitor, when present, binds to $R_1^*$ and completely prevents it from inactivating $R_2$.
