The engineered metabolic network simplifies the cell's entire glucose catabolism into two distinct, competing routes: a Butanologenic Route for production and a Redox-Balancing Route for generating essential cofactors.\n\n1.  **Butanologenic Route**: A sequence of enzymatic reactions that convert glucose into n-butanol. This process can be described by the following two stages:\n    a) Glycolysis via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, where $\\text{NAD}^+$ is the oxidized form and NADH is the reduced form of the cofactor Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide:\n    $$\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 + 2 \\text{NAD}^+ + 2 \\text{ADP} + 2 \\text{P}_i \\rightarrow 2 \\text{Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{NADH} + 2 \\text{H}^+ + 2 \\text{ATP} + 2 \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\n    b) Conversion of pyruvate to n-butanol and byproducts through a modified fermentation pathway:\n    $$2 \\text{Pyruvate} + 4 \\text{NADH} + 4 \\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O} + 2 \\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 4 \\text{NAD}^+$$\n\n2.  **Redox-Balancing Route**: To generate the reducing equivalents (NADH) needed by the Butanologenic Route, a fraction of the glucose is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide. The net reaction for this aerobic-like respiration process is:\n    $$\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 + 6 \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 10 \\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 6 \\text{CO}_2 + 10 \\text{NADH} + 10 \\text{H}^+$$\n\nAssuming the overall metabolism operates at a steady state where there is no net accumulation or depletion of NADH, calculate the maximum theoretical molar yield of n-butanol from glucose (defined as moles of n-butanol produced per mole of glucose consumed).

Per mole of glucose through BR, glycolysis produces $2$ NADH and the conversion step consumes $4$ NADH. Therefore, the BR has a net consumption of $2$ NADH per mole of glucose and produces $1$ mole of n-butanol per mole of glucose:\n$$\\text{Net BR: } \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 + 2 \\text{NADH} + 2 \\text{H}^+ + 2 \\text{ADP} + 2 \\text{P}_i \\rightarrow \\text{C}_4\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O} + 2 \\text{CO}_2 + 2 \\text{NAD}^+ + 2 \\text{ATP} + 3 \\text{H}_2\\text{O}.$$\nThus, NADH balance for BR: $-2x$.\n\n- RR generates $10$ NADH per mole of glucose:\n$$\\text{RR: } \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 + 6 \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 10 \\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 6 \\text{CO}_2 + 10 \\text{NADH} + 10 \\text{H}^+.$$\nThus, NADH balance for RR: $+10y$.\n\nSteady-state NADH requires no net accumulation:\n$$10y - 2x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = \\frac{1}{5}x.$$\n\nWith $x + y = 1$, substitute $y$:\n$$x + \\frac{1}{5}x = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{6}{5}x = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{5}{6}, \\quad y = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n\nButanol production per mole of glucose through BR is $1$, so the molar yield (moles n-butanol per mole glucose consumed) equals $x$:\n$$Y_{\\text{butanol/glucose}} = x = \\frac{5}{6}.$$\n\nCarbon accounting check to ensure feasibility:\n- Butanol carbon: $4x = 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{10}{3}$.\n- Carbon dioxide carbon: BR gives $2x$, RR gives $6y$, so total $\\frac{2 \\cdot 5}{6} + \\frac{6 \\cdot 1}{6} = \\frac{10}{6} + \\frac{6}{6} = \\frac{16}{6} = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n- Total carbon out: $\\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6$, matching the $6$ carbons of one mole of glucose.\n\nTherefore, the maximum theoretical molar yield is $\\frac{5}{6}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$$", "id": "2057174"}, {"introduction": "Once a metabolic pathway is chosen, the next challenge is to implement it by engineering the host's genetics.

The student's goal is to introduce a plasmid that enables the final two steps of the n-butanol synthesis pathway, starting from the precursor molecule butyryl-CoA. These steps are catalyzed by two enzymes, Butyraldehyde Dehydrogenase and Butanol Dehydrogenase, whose genes are sourced from a bacterium.\n\nTo construct the expression plasmid, the student has access to the following genetic parts:\n*   **Yeast Promoters:** `P_TDH3` and `P_TEF1` (strong, constitutive promoters in yeast).\n*   **Bacterial Promoter:** `P_lac` (the lac operon promoter from *E. coli*).\n*   **Open Reading Frames (ORFs):** `bldH` (coding sequence for Butyraldehyde Dehydrogenase) and `bdhB` (coding sequence for Butanol Dehydrogenase).\n*   **Yeast Terminators:** `T_CYC1` and `T_ADH1` (standard transcription terminators in yeast).\n*   **Yeast Selectable Marker:** The `URA3` gene, which restores uracil synthesis.\n*   **Yeast Origin of Replication:** `ARS/CEN`, a sequence that allows for stable, low-copy number replication of the plasmid in yeast.\n*   **Bacterial Plasmid Backbone:** A standard backbone containing an *E. coli* origin of replication (`pUC ori`) and an ampicillin resistance gene (`AmpR`) for plasmid amplification in bacteria.\n\nThe components are denoted in the format `[Part Name]`, and a complete plasmid design is represented as a series of these components linked together.

The provided parts fulfilling this are [pUC ori] and [AmpR].\n2) For stable maintenance in yeast as a low-copy autonomous plasmid, the construct must contain a yeast origin and centromeric sequence, here [ARS/CEN].\n3) For selection in the ura3 deletion host, the plasmid must carry a functional URA3 marker to complement uracil auxotrophy, i.e., [URA3].\n4) For gene expression in yeast, each ORF must be placed under a yeast-compatible promoter and a yeast transcription terminator. The provided yeast promoters are [P_TDH3] and [P_TEF1]; the provided yeast terminators are [T_CYC1] and [T_ADH1]. The bacterial promoter [P_lac] is not functional for transcription initiation by the yeast RNA polymerase II and therefore should not be used to drive expression in yeast.\n5) Each ORF should have its own complete expression cassette, i.e., [Yeast promoter - ORF - Yeast terminator], to ensure proper transcription termination and mRNA stability.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A includes [pUC ori], [AmpR] for E. coli propagation; [ARS/CEN] for yeast replication; [URA3] for selection in the ura3 deletion strain; and two complete yeast expression cassettes: [P_TDH3 - bldH ORF - T_CYC1] and [P_TEF1 - bdhB ORF - T_ADH1]. This satisfies all requirements.\n- Option B uses [P_lac] to drive bldH. Because [P_lac] is a bacterial promoter not recognized by yeast RNA polymerase II, bldH would not be expressed in yeast. Therefore, it is not a fully functional co-expression construct in yeast.\n- Option C lacks a terminator for the bdhB cassette. Absence of a proper yeast terminator compromises proper transcription termination and mRNA processing, so it is not a complete expression cassette and thus not fully functional by design criteria.\n- Option D omits [ARS/CEN]. Without a yeast origin/centromere, the plasmid will not be stably maintained in yeast as an autonomously replicating plasmid. Therefore, it is not a fully functional construct for the stated goal.\n- Option E lacks [URA3]. In the ura3 deletion host, this prevents selection for the plasmid in yeast, making the construct unsuitable for the specified strain and selection scheme.\n\nConclusion: Only option A meets all replication, selection, and expression requirements for co-expression of bldH and bdhB in the ura3 deletion Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2057175"}, {"introduction": "A common challenge in biofuel production is that the product itself can be toxic to the microbial host, limiting the final yield.

The cultures were incubated under identical conditions for 24 hours. The growth of the bacterial population in each tube was quantified by measuring the final Optical Density (OD) at 600 nm, which is a common proxy for cell concentration.\n\nThe results of the experiment are summarized in the table below:\n\n| n-Butanol Concentration (g/L) | Final Optical Density ($\\text{OD}_{600}$) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 0.0 (Control) | 1.50 |\n| 1.0 | 1.45 |\n| 3.0 | 1.20 |\n| 5.0 | 0.85 |\n| 7.0 | 0.60 |\n| 9.0 | 0.35 |\n| 11.0 | 0.10 |\n\nBased on these data, determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration ($IC_{50}$) of n-butanol for this *E. coli* strain.
