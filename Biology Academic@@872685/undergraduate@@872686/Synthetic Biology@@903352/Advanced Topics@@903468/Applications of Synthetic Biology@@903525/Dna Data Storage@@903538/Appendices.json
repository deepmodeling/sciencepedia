During data retrieval, all three physical copies are sequenced. The original sequence is then reconstructed by a majority-rules consensus: for each position in the sequence, the base that appears in at least two of the three copies is assumed to be the original, correct base.\n\nAn engineer is trying to retrieve a 4-base-long data segment. The three sequencing reads obtained are:\n- Read 1: `GATC`\n- Read 2: `GTTC`\n- Read 3: `GTTC`\n\nSingle-base errors in DNA synthesis or sequencing are typically categorized as one of the following:\n- **Substitution**: A single base is replaced by a different base (e.g., `A` becomes `G`).\n- **Insertion**: An extra base is added into the sequence (e.g., `GTC` becomes `GTAC`).\n- **Deletion**: A single base is removed from the sequence (e.g., `GTC` becomes `GC`).\n\nBased on the provided reads and the majority-rules consensus method, determine the most likely original sequence and identify the type of error that occurred in the one non-conforming read.\n\nA) Original: `GTTC`; Error: Substitution\n\nB) Original: `GATC`; Error: Substitution\n\nC) Original: `GATC`; Error: Deletion\n\nD) Original: `GTTC`; Error: Insertion\n\nE) Original: `GTAC`; Error: Substitution", "solution": "We denote the three reads as sequences of length $4$:\n- $R_{1}=\\text{GATC}$\n- $R_{2}=\\text{GTTC}$\n- $R_{3}=\\text{GTTC}$\n\nUsing majority-rules consensus, for each position $i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, the consensus base $C_{i}$ is defined as the mode of $\\{R_{1,i},R_{2,i},R_{3,i}\\}$.\n\nCompute position-wise majorities:\n- Position $i=1$: $\\{G,G,G\\}\\Rightarrow C_{1}=G$.\n- Position $i=2$: $\\{A,T,T\\}\\Rightarrow C_{2}=T$.\n- Position $i=3$: $\\{T,T,T\\}\\Rightarrow C_{3}=T$.\n- Position $i=4$: $\\{C,C,C\\}\\Rightarrow C_{4}=C$.\n\nThus the consensus (most likely original) sequence is $\\text{GTTC}$.\n\nNext, identify the error type in the non-conforming read.
