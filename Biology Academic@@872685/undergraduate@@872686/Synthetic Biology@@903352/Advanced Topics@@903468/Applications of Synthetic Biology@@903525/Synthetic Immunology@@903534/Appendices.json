This practice explores a common real-world problem where an engineered receptor must function in the presence of competing molecules from the patient's own body. By applying the principles of competitive binding equilibrium, you can determine the necessary concentration of a therapeutic agent to outcompete an inhibitor and ensure the desired therapeutic effect [@problem_id:2072566].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is developing a novel immunotherapy platform called the \"Tag-and-Target\" system. This system utilizes universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells, which are engineered to recognize and bind to a non-native, synthetic small molecule called \"Tag-S\". The therapeutic strategy involves two steps: first, administering these universal CAR-T cells to the patient, and second, administering a \"Bridging Molecule\". The Bridging Molecule consists of Tag-S covalently linked to a tumor-specific antibody. When the Bridging Molecule binds to the CAR on a T-cell, it \"arms\" the T-cell, directing it to attack tumor cells recognized by the antibody portion.\n\nA major challenge arises from the discovery that Tag-S is structurally identical to a metabolite naturally present in the patient's plasma at a constant concentration of $150 \\text{ nM}$. This free Tag-S acts as a competitive inhibitor, binding to the CARs and preventing them from being armed by the therapeutic Bridging Molecule.\n\nThe binding interaction between the Tag-S motif (whether free or on the Bridging Molecule) and the universal CAR has a dissociation constant, $K_D$, of $60 \\text{ nM}$. For the therapy to be effective, at least $90\\%$ of the total CAR sites on the T-cell population must be occupied by the therapeutic Bridging Molecule.\n\nAssuming the system is at equilibrium, calculate the minimum concentration of the Bridging Molecule that must be achieved in the plasma to meet this therapeutic requirement. Express the final concentration in micromolars ($\\mu M$). Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $[C_{total}]$ be the total concentration of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) binding sites. Let $[B]$ be the concentration of the therapeutic Bridging Molecule and $[I]$ be the concentration of the free Tag-S inhibitor. The problem provides $[I] = 150 \\text{ nM}$ and $K_D = 60 \\text{ nM}$. The goal is to find the concentration $[B]$ such that the fraction of CARs bound to the Bridging Molecule is $\\alpha = 0.90$.\n\nThe system involves two competing equilibrium reactions:\n1. The binding of the CAR to the Bridging Molecule: $C + B \\rightleftharpoons CB$\n2. The binding of the CAR to the inhibitor: $C + I \\rightleftharpoons CI$\n\nHere, $C$ represents the free (unbound) CAR, $CB$ represents the CAR-Bridging Molecule complex, and $CI$ represents the CAR-inhibitor complex.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, describes both equilibria, as the binding motif (Tag-S) is the same:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[C][B]}{[CB]} = \\frac{[C][I]}{[CI]}$$\n\nFrom these expressions, we can express the concentrations of the bound complexes in terms of the free CAR concentration, $[C]$:\n$$[CB] = \\frac{[C][B]}{K_D}$$\n$$[CI] = \\frac{[C][I]}{K_D}$$\n\nThe total concentration of CAR sites is the sum of the free and bound forms:\n$$[C_{total}] = [C] + [CB] + [CI]$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $[CB]$ and $[CI]$:\n$$[C_{total}] = [C] + \\frac{[C][B]}{K_D} + \\frac{[C][I]}{K_D}$$\n$$[C_{total}] = [C] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_D} + \\frac{[I]}{K_D} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem requires that the fraction of CARs bound to the Bridging Molecule, $\\alpha$, is at least $0.90$. This fraction is defined as:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{[CB]}{[C_{total}]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[CB]$ and $[C_{total}]$ into this equation:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{[C][B]}{K_D}}{[C] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_D} + \\frac{[I]}{K_D} \\right)}$$\n\nThe term for the free CAR concentration, $[C]$, cancels out, which is expected as the fractional occupancy should not depend on the total receptor concentration:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{[B]}{K_D}}{1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_D} + \\frac{[I]}{K_D}}$$\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $K_D$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{[B]}{K_D + [B] + [I]}$$\n\nWe need to solve this equation for $[B]$:\n$$\\alpha (K_D + [B] + [I]) = [B]$$\n$$\\alpha K_D + \\alpha [B] + \\alpha [I] = [B]$$\n$$\\alpha K_D + \\alpha [I] = [B] - \\alpha [B]$$\n$$\\alpha (K_D + [I]) = [B] (1 - \\alpha)$$\n$$[B] = \\frac{\\alpha (K_D + [I])}{1 - \\alpha}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values. First, we must ensure all concentrations are in the same units. The question asks for the final answer in micromolars ($\\mu M$), so let's convert the given nanomolar (nM) values:\n$K_D = 60 \\text{ nM} = 0.060 \\text{ } \\mu M$\n$[I] = 150 \\text{ nM} = 0.150 \\text{ } \\mu M$\nThe required fraction is $\\alpha = 0.90$.\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula for $[B]$:\n$$[B] = \\frac{0.90 (0.060 \\text{ } \\mu M + 0.150 \\text{ } \\mu M)}{1 - 0.90}$$\n$$[B] = \\frac{0.90 (0.210 \\text{ } \\mu M)}{0.10}$$\n$$[B] = \\frac{0.189 \\text{ } \\mu M}{0.10}$$\n$$[B] = 1.89 \\text{ } \\mu M$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The result $1.89$ already has three significant figures.\n\nThus, a minimum concentration of $1.89 \\text{ } \\mu M$ of the Bridging Molecule is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.89}$$", "id": "2072566"}, {"introduction": "Synthetic biology empowers us to program cells with sophisticated logic, moving beyond simple 'on' or 'off' responses.

This \"counter\" is based on a sequential genetic circuit. The core of the circuit consists of a strong constitutive promoter (`P_const`) followed by three sequential Recombinase-Addressable Gates (RAG-1, RAG-2, and RAG-3) and finally the gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which serves as a reporter for activation. The genetic layout is: `P_const -> RAG-1 -> RAG-2 -> RAG-3 -> GFP`.\n\nEach RAG contains a transcriptional terminator that prevents `P_const` from expressing any downstream genes. The cell's state is defined by the number of terminators that have been removed.\n- **State 0:** All three RAGs are intact. The cell is OFF.\n- **State 1:** The terminator in RAG-1 is removed. The cell is OFF.\n- **State 2:** The terminators in RAG-1 and RAG-2 are removed. The cell is OFF.\n- **State 3:** All three terminators are removed. `P_const` can now drive expression of the `GFP` gene. The cell is considered ON (activated) and fluoresces green.\n\nThe removal of each terminator is an irreversible event mediated by a specific recombinase enzyme (`Rec1`, `Rec2`, or `Rec3`). The expression of these recombinases is triggered by a signaling cascade initiated by an antigen encounter. The system is designed to be sequential:\n- A cell in **State 0** that encounters an antigen will express `Rec1`, which removes the terminator in RAG-1, causing the cell to transition to **State 1**.\n- A cell in **State 1** that encounters an antigen will express `Rec2`, which removes the terminator in RAG-2, causing the cell to transition to **State 2**.\n- A cell in **State 2** that encounters an antigen will express `Rec3`, which removes the terminator in RAG-3, causing the cell to transition to **State 3**.\n- A cell already in **State 3** remains in State 3 upon further antigen encounters.\n\nA researcher prepares a large population of these engineered cells.
