This folding is directed by hundreds of shorter, synthetic DNA molecules called 'staple strands'. Each staple strand is designed to bind to specific segments of the scaffold, holding the scaffold in its target conformation.\n\nConsider the design of a large, flat nanostructure using the common M13mp18 viral DNA as the scaffold strand, which has a total length of $L_{\\text{scaffold}} = 7249$ nucleotides.

This thought experiment challenges you to think like an experimentalist by predicting the observable structural defect when a single component is missing from the self-assembly process. This helps build intuition for interpreting experimental data from techniques like Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) [@problem_id:2032198].", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, DNA origami is a powerful technique for constructing nanoscale objects. The process involves folding a long, single-stranded \"scaffold\" DNA molecule (often from a viral genome) into a desired shape using hundreds of short, synthetic \"staple\" strands. Each staple strand is designed to bind to two or more non-contiguous segments of the scaffold, acting as a cross-link to hold the folded structure in place.\n\nImagine a researcher is designing a simple, two-dimensional rectangular DNA origami structure. During the preparation of the reaction mixture, a single staple strand that was intended to bind to a region in the middle of the rectangle (i.e., an *internal* staple, not one at an edge or corner) is accidentally omitted. The mixture is then subjected to the standard thermal annealing process to allow the structure to self-assemble. The resulting structures are then imaged using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), a high-resolution imaging technique that visualizes surface topography.\n\nAssuming the concentration of all other staples is sufficient for assembly, which of the following options best describes the most likely structural defect that would be observed in the AFM images for the affected origami objects?\n\nA. The entire rectangular structure will fail to form, resulting in a random coil of DNA.\n\nB. A localized, flexible loop of the scaffold strand will bulge out from the surface of the otherwise correctly formed rectangle.\n\nC. A discrete hole, with a shape and size corresponding to the missing staple, will appear within the flat plane of the rectangle.\n\nD. The staples adjacent to the omitted one will bind to each other across the gap, causing a local puckering but sealing the defect.\n\nE. The rectangle will appear to be formed perfectly, as the surrounding staples will compensate for the missing one, holding the scaffold in place.", "solution": "DNA origami assembly is driven by the hybridization of many staple strands to a long scaffold, lowering the free energy of the folded state. Denote the free energy contribution of staple $i$ binding as $\\Delta G_{i}<0$. For $N$ staples present, the assembly free energy is\n$\\Delta G_{\\text{assembly}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\Delta G_{i}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{confinement}},\n$\nwhere $T\\Delta S_{\\text{confinement}}$ is the entropic cost of constraining the scaffold into the designed geometry. Omitting a single internal staple removes one stabilizing term $\\Delta G_{j}$, changing the total by approximately $|\\Delta G_{j}|$, but typically leaving $\\Delta G_{\\text{assembly}}<0$ because the other staples still provide many hybridization contacts. Therefore, the overall rectangle still folds rather than collapsing into a random coil, ruling out option A.\n\nAn internal staple normally cross-links noncontiguous scaffold segments and constrains them to lie in the designed 2D plane. If that staple is missing, the corresponding scaffold bases remain unpaired and unconstrained locally. Unpaired scaffold in that region behaves as flexible single-stranded DNA, with a much lower effective bending stiffness than double-stranded DNA, and with increased conformational entropy. The system lowers its free energy by allowing this unconstrained segment to adopt a relaxed, out-of-plane conformation rather than maintaining a strained, planar void. On an AFM substrate, such a flexible, unbound segment often appears as a localized, mobile protrusion or “bulge,” not as a clean, planar vacancy. This supports option B.\n\nOption C would require a rigid, in-plane void matching the missing staple’s footprint, but no material is removed: the scaffold is still present and simply not cross-linked, so a discrete, flat hole is not expected. Option D requires staples to hybridize to each other across the gap; staple–staple binding is disfavored by sequence design (lack of complementarity) and geometry, making such “self-repair” unlikely. Option E is inconsistent with the loss of a specific cross-link: while global folding succeeds, the local constraint is not fully compensated by surrounding staples, so a defect remains.\n\nTherefore, the most likely AFM-observable defect is a localized, flexible protrusion corresponding to the unpaired scaffold where the internal staple is missing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2032198"}]}
