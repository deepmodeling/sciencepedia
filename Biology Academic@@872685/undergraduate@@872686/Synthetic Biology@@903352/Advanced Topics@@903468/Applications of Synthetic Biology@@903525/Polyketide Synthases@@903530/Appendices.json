This first exercise challenges you to predict the chemical structure of a polyketide based on a defined PKS blueprint. By tracing the path from a starter unit through several non-reducing extension modules, you will practice the fundamental logic of chain elongation and see how the characteristic poly-$\\beta$-keto backbone is formed, a foundational skill for designing novel compounds [@problem_id:2055266].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing an engineered modular Polyketide Synthase (PKS) to produce a novel linear molecule. The design specifies a loading module that utilizes propionyl-Coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) as the starter unit. This is followed by three extension modules arranged sequentially. Each of these three extension modules is programmed to incorporate one molecule of malonyl-CoA as the extender unit. Critically, these extension modules contain only the minimal set of catalytic domains required for chain elongation (Ketosynthase, Acyltransferase, and Acyl Carrier Protein) and lack any domains for ketoreduction, dehydration, or enoyl reduction. The process is terminated by a thioesterase domain that hydrolyzes the final polyketide chain from the PKS, yielding a linear carboxylic acid.\n\nBased on this design, which of the following statements accurately describes the chemical structure of the final linear polyketide product?\n\nA. A linear nine-carbon chain containing a terminal carboxylic acid and ketone groups at the C-3, C-5, and C-7 positions (numbering from the carboxylic acid carbon as C-1).\n\nB. A linear twelve-carbon chain containing a terminal carboxylic acid and ketone groups at the C-3, C-5, and C-7 positions.\n\nC. An eight-carbon chain containing a terminal carboxylic acid and ketone groups at the C-3, C-5, and C-7 positions.\n\nD. A saturated nine-carbon linear chain with a terminal carboxylic acid (nonanoic acid).\n\nE. A linear nine-carbon chain containing a terminal carboxylic acid and ketone groups at the C-2, C-4, and C-6 positions.", "solution": "The problem asks for the structure of a polyketide synthesized by a specific modular Polyketide Synthase (PKS). We can determine this structure by tracking the assembly process step-by-step, from the starter unit through each extension module.\n\n**Step 1: The Starter Unit**\nThe process begins at the loading module, which primes the PKS with a starter unit. The specified starter unit is propionyl-CoA. The propionyl group, which is a three-carbon acyl group ($\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-$), is loaded onto the PKS. This forms the initial segment of the growing polyketide chain.\nChain after loading: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO-S-PKS}$\n\n**Step 2: First Extension Module**\nThe first extension module performs a Claisen condensation. The Acyltransferase (AT) domain of this module loads a malonyl-CoA extender unit. Malonyl-CoA contributes a three-carbon malonate group ($\\text{HOOC}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-$). The Ketosynthase (KS) domain then catalyzes the condensation reaction between the propionyl group (from the loading module) and the malonyl group. This condensation is accompanied by the decarboxylation (loss of $CO_2$) of the malonyl group. Thus, each malonyl-CoA extender unit effectively adds a two-carbon unit (an acetyl group, $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-$) to the growing chain.\n- Starter chain: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO-S-PKS}$\n- Extender unit added: $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-$\n- Chain after 1st extension: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO-S-PKS}$\nThis condensation creates a $\\beta$-keto group. The problem states that there are no reductive domains (Ketoreductase, Dehydratase, Enoylreductase), so this ketone is not modified. The chain now has $3 + 2 = 5$ carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Second Extension Module**\nThe 5-carbon chain is passed to the second extension module. This module repeats the same process: it loads another malonyl-CoA, which adds another two-carbon unit via a decarboxylative Claisen condensation.\n- Chain before 2nd extension: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO-S-PKS}$\n- Extender unit added: $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-$\n- Chain after 2nd extension: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO-S-PKS}$\nAgain, a new $\\beta$-keto group is formed and remains unmodified. The chain length is now $5 + 2 = 7$ carbons.\n\n**Step 4: Third Extension Module**\nThe 7-carbon chain is passed to the third and final extension module. The process is repeated one last time.\n- Chain before 3rd extension: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO-S-PKS}$\n- Extender unit added: $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-$\n- Chain after 3rd extension: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO-S-PKS}$\nThe final chain attached to the PKS now contains $7 + 2 = 9$ carbons. It has three unmodified ketone groups.\n\n**Step 5: Termination**\nA thioesterase (TE) domain hydrolyzes the thioester bond, releasing the final product from the PKS as a free carboxylic acid.\n- Final chain on PKS: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO-S-PKS}$\n- Released product: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{COOH}$\n\n**Step 6: Analyzing the Final Structure**\nThe final product is $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CO}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{COOH}$. Let's analyze its features:\n- **Total Carbons:** The starter unit provided 3 carbons. Each of the three extension modules added 2 carbons ($3 \\times 2 = 6$). The total number of carbons in the final molecule is $3 + 6 = 9$.\n- **Functional Groups:** The chain is terminated by a carboxylic acid group ($-\\text{COOH}$). Due to the lack of reductive domains, each of the three extension steps resulted in a ketone group ($-\\text{CO}-$).\n- **Position of Ketones:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, we number the carbon chain starting from the carboxylic acid carbon as C-1.\n  $$\\text{CH}_3(9)-\\text{CH}_2(8)-\\underset{\\text{O}}{\\underset{||}{\\text{C}}}(7)-\\text{CH}_2(6)-\\underset{\\text{O}}{\\underset{||}{\\text{C}}}(5)-\\text{CH}_2(4)-\\underset{\\text{O}}{\\underset{||}{\\text{C}}}(3)-\\text{CH}_2(2)-\\underset{\\text{O}}{\\underset{||}{\\text{C}}}\\text{OH}(1)$$\n  The ketone groups are located at positions C-3, C-5, and C-7.\n\n**Step 7: Comparing with Options**\n- **A:** A linear nine-carbon chain with a terminal carboxylic acid and ketones at C-3, C-5, and C-7. This matches our derived structure perfectly.\n- **B:** Incorrectly states a twelve-carbon chain. This would happen if one mistakenly assumes that malonyl-CoA adds three carbons instead of two.\n- **C:** Incorrectly states an eight-carbon chain. This would result from using an acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) starter unit instead of propionyl-CoA ($2 + 3 \\times 2 = 8$).\n- **D:** Incorrectly states the chain is saturated. This would happen if all ketone groups were fully reduced, which is explicitly ruled out.\n- **E:** States the correct carbon count but incorrect ketone positions (C-2, C-4, C-6). This is mechanistically incorrect, as the Claisen condensation always forms a $\\beta$-ketoacyl intermediate, placing the new ketone at the C-3 position relative to the thioester.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is given in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2055266"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting structure, a key aspect of metabolic engineering is understanding the quantitative demands of a biosynthetic pathway.

The AT domain is specific for loading methylmalonyl-CoA as the extender unit, and the KR domain is fully active.\n- **Module 2:** Comprises KS, AT, and ACP domains.
