After modifying a phage's host-recognition machinery, such as its tail fibers, it is crucial to quantitatively assess the success of the engineering effort. This problem introduces a practical method for evaluating engineered phage variants by comparing their infectivity on the new target pathogen versus the original host, allowing you to identify the most promising candidate for therapeutic development [@problem_id:2034397].", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is developing engineered bacteriophages for therapeutic use against a pathogenic bacterial strain, `Strain-R`, which has developed widespread antibiotic resistance. The original, wild-type phage, `Phage-WT`, is highly effective at infecting a non-pathogenic laboratory host, `Strain-S`, but shows negligible activity against `Strain-R`. The engineering strategy focuses on modifying the phage's tail fiber proteins to switch its host preference from `Strain-S` to `Strain-R`.\n\nAfter performing genetic modifications, the team has produced three promising engineered variants: `Phage-E1`, `Phage-E2`, and `Phage-E3`. To evaluate their success, they conduct quantitative plaque assays. This involves preparing separate agar plates with a uniform lawn of each bacterial strain (`Strain-S` and `Strain-R`) and then applying serial dilutions of each phage stock to determine the concentration of infectious particles. This concentration, or titer, is measured in Plaque-Forming Units per milliliter (PFU/mL).

The HSE is calculated as the ratio of the phage's titer on the target strain (`Strain-R`) to its titer on the original host strain (`Strain-S`).
