A bioengineer is designing three different synthetic proteins, each for a specific task within a eukaryotic cell. To achieve the desired functionality and localization for each protein, the engineer must incorporate the correct functional domain or motif.\n\nMatch each of the following protein components (1-3) with its corresponding primary molecular function (I-III).\n\n**Components:**\n1.  Kinase Domain\n2.  Transmembrane Domain\n3.  Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS)\n\n**Functions:**\nI.   A sequence of hydrophobic amino acids that stably inserts a protein into the lipid bilayer of a membrane.\nII.

A kinase domain is an enzymatic domain that catalyzes phosphorylation. Mechanistically, kinases transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a specific amino acid residue (commonly serine, threonine, or tyrosine) on a substrate protein. This directly matches function III: an enzymatic region that catalyzes transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a target protein.\n\n2. A transmembrane domain is typically a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that forms an alpha-helix capable of stably partitioning into the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers, thus anchoring or spanning membranes. This directly matches function I: a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids that inserts a protein into the lipid bilayer.\n\n3. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) is a short peptide sequence, often enriched in basic residues, that is recognized by importin receptors to direct a protein’s transport from the cytoplasm into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. This directly matches function II: a short peptide sequence that directs nuclear import.\n\nTherefore, the correct mapping is 1-III, 2-I, 3-II, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2059399"}, {"introduction": "Once you can identify individual protein \"parts,\" the next logical step is to predict how they will function when combined. The true power of modularity in biology lies in this combinatorial logic. This practice challenges you to think like a bioinformatician, deducing a protein's primary location and biological role simply by analyzing the domains present in its amino acid sequence [@problem_id:2332920].", "problem": "In a study of protein function within a eukaryotic cell line, researchers identify a novel protein they name \"Regulon-X\". Through bioinformatic analysis of its amino acid sequence, they predict the presence of two distinct and well-characterized structural regions or motifs within the protein:\n\n1.  A **Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS)**, which is a short sequence of amino acids that serves as a tag for targeting proteins for import into the cell nucleus from the cytoplasm.\n2.  A **DNA-Binding Domain (DBD)**, which is a protein structural motif that exhibits a high affinity for binding to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).\n\nBased on the presence of these two domains, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary subcellular location and general function of the Regulon-X protein?\n\nA. Located in the nucleus; functions as a regulator of gene expression.\n\nB. Located in the cytoplasm; functions by degrading viral DNA that enters the cell.\n\nC. Located within the rough endoplasmic reticulum; functions to assist in the folding of newly synthesized proteins.\n\nD. Secreted from the cell; functions as a hormone to signal other cells.\n\nE.

A Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) is a targeting sequence that directs a protein to the nucleus via the importin pathway, indicating the primary subcellular location is the nucleus. A DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) confers the ability to directly bind DNA, a hallmark of transcription factors and other nuclear regulators of gene expression.\n\nMatch these implications to the options. Option A states nuclear localization and regulation of gene expression, which directly follows from the presence of an NLS and a DBD. Option B suggests a cytoplasmic location and viral DNA degradation; this would require nuclease activity and does not align with an NLS or a DBD geared toward genomic DNA regulation. Option C suggests ER localization and protein folding; ER-resident chaperones typically have an N-terminal signal peptide and ER retention signals (for example, KDEL), not an NLS or a DBD. Option D suggests secretion and hormonal function, which would require a signal peptide for the secretory pathway, not an NLS or a DBD. Option E suggests a plasma membrane ion channel, which would feature multiple transmembrane domains, not a DBD nor an NLS.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that Regulon-X localizes to the nucleus and functions as a regulator of gene expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332920"}, {"introduction": "Moving from prediction to practical application, this final exercise addresses a common and critical challenge in synthetic biology. A design that looks perfect on paper must still work in the complex environment of a living cell. This problem explores why the linear arrangement of domains in a fusion protein is not trivial, highlighting how physical and spatial constraints can mean the difference between a successful design and a failed experiment [@problem_id:2059462].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist aims to create a fluorescent reporter to visualize the location of a specific DNA sequence within a living cell. The strategy is to fuse a custom-designed DNA-Binding Domain (DBD), which recognizes the target sequence, to a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Two versions of the fusion protein are constructed and expressed in cells. In a protein sequence, the \"N-terminus\" is the start of the polypeptide chain, and the \"C-terminus\" is the end.\n\n1.  **Construct 1**: The protein is synthesized with the DBD at the N-terminus and the GFP at the C-terminus (`DBD-GFP`).\n2.  **Construct 2**: The protein is synthesized with the GFP at the N-terminus and the DBD at the C-terminus (`GFP-DBD`).\n\nUpon examining the cells under a microscope, the biologist observes that cells expressing `Construct 1` show bright, localized fluorescence at the expected DNA target sites. In contrast, cells expressing `Construct 2` exhibit diffuse green fluorescence throughout the entire cell, with no specific localization.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most likely explanation for this difference in functionality?\n\nA. The bulky structure of the GFP at the N-terminus in `Construct 2` sterically hinders the DBD from folding correctly or from accessing its target DNA sequence.\n\nB. The ribosome translates the GFP sequence much more slowly than the DBD sequence, causing premature termination of protein synthesis when GFP is at the N-terminus.\n\nC. In `Construct 2`, the DBD at the C-terminus is incorrectly recognized as a degradation signal, leading to rapid destruction of the protein before it can bind to DNA.\n\nD. The chromophore of GFP can only form correctly and produce fluorescence when it's a C-terminal tag.\n\nE. The DBD can only function if it is the very first part of the protein to emerge from the ribosome during translation, a phenomenon known as mandatory co-translational folding.", "solution": "We are comparing two fusion orientations of a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and GFP: Construct 1 has the DBD at the N-terminus and GFP at the C-terminus, while Construct 2 has GFP at the N-terminus and the DBD at the C-terminus. The observed outcomes are that Construct 1 yields bright, localized fluorescence at expected DNA target sites, indicating successful DNA binding and proper localization, whereas Construct 2 yields diffuse fluorescence, indicating that the fusion protein is present and fluorescent but not localized to the DNA targets.\n\nFrom these observations, we infer that GFP is properly expressed and its chromophore matures in both constructs, because fluorescence is observed in both cases. Therefore, options that hinge on failed GFP maturation or failed translation are inconsistent with the observations. Specifically, the presence of diffuse fluorescence argues against rapid degradation (which would reduce signal) and against translation failure (which would reduce or eliminate protein yield), and it also contradicts any claim that GFP only fluoresces with a C-terminal tag.\n\nWe now evaluate each option logically against the data:\n\nA. Placing GFP at the N-terminus can sterically hinder the DBD from folding correctly or from accessing its DNA target sequence, particularly if the DBD’s DNA-contacting interface or conformational stability depends on a free N-terminus or unhindered proximity around that terminus. This would explain why the DBD in Construct 2 fails to bind DNA and why fluorescence remains diffuse. This explanation is consistent with the observation that Construct 1, with a free N-terminus for the DBD, localizes correctly.\n\nB. The claim that slower translation of GFP at the N-terminus causes premature termination is not supported. Premature termination would reduce or abolish full-length protein and thus should reduce fluorescence. The observed robust diffuse fluorescence indicates that full-length GFP-DBD is produced and folds sufficiently to fluoresce. Moreover, differential codon translation speed is not known to systematically cause premature termination in this manner.\n\nC. The assertion that a C-terminal DBD is recognized as a degradation signal is not a general phenomenon. If rapid degradation occurred, one would expect reduced fluorescence, not bright diffuse fluorescence. The data do not support accelerated degradation as the primary cause.\n\nD. GFP chromophore formation does not require a C-terminal tag; GFP is widely used successfully as either an N-terminal or C-terminal fusion partner. The diffuse fluorescence in Construct 2 demonstrates that GFP is functional at the N-terminus.\n\nE. While co-translational folding can influence protein folding pathways, the claim that the DBD can only function if it is the very first segment to emerge from the ribosome is overly strict and not generally valid. Many DBDs function in either orientation depending on appropriate linker design and steric constraints. The observed difference is more parsimoniously explained by steric interference rather than a universal requirement for translation order.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that the N-terminal GFP in Construct 2 sterically hinders the DBD’s proper folding or access to DNA, preventing specific localization, whereas Construct 1 preserves DBD function by leaving its N-terminus unobstructed. Hence, option A is the best choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2059462"}]}
