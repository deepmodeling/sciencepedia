They are interested in comparing the intrinsic strength of a standard 'housekeeping' promoter, $P_{70}$, which is recognized by the sigma factor $\\sigma^{70}$, with an alternative promoter, $P_{32}$, recognized by the heat-shock sigma factor $\\sigma^{32}$.\n\nTwo strains of *E. coli* are constructed. Each strain carries a plasmid with a gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a reporter that fluoresces when expressed. In the first strain, GFP expression is controlled by the $P_{70}$ promoter. In the second strain, it is controlled by the $P_{32}$ promoter. The plasmids are otherwise identical, particularly in their copy number and the efficiency of translating the GFP messenger RNA.\n\nA simplified model of gene expression is assumed, where the measured steady-state fluorescence ($F$) from a reporter strain is directly proportional to the product of the intrinsic strength ($s$) of its promoter and the total cellular concentration of the corresponding sigma factor protein ($[\\sigma]$).
