Intrinsic noise, such as cell-to-cell variation in plasmid copy number, can lead to diverse responses even under uniform conditions.

The core of this circuit is a photoreceptor protein $P$, whose gene is located on a multi-copy plasmid. The expression of $P$ is constitutive, leading to a total intracellular concentration of this protein, $[P]_{\\text{total}}$, that is directly proportional to the plasmid copy number, $N$, in that specific cell. This relationship is given by $[P]_{\\text{total}} = c_p N$, where $c_p$ is a constant that encapsulates the rates of protein production and dilution.\n\nUpon exposure to blue light of intensity $L$, the protein $P$ undergoes a conformational change to become an active transcription factor, $A$. This conversion is reversible, and at steady state under constant illumination, the concentration of the active form $[A]$ is described by the Michaelis-Menten-like relation:\n$$ [A] = [P]_{\\text{total}} \\frac{L}{K_L + L} $$\nwhere $K_L$ is the light-activation constant, representing the light intensity at which half of the photoreceptors are in the active state $A$.\n\nTo create a sharp, switch-like response, the system includes a \"titration\" module.

The active transcription factor $A$ binds with very high affinity to the repressor $R$, forming an inactive complex. This sequestration is assumed to be perfectly stoichiometric, meaning that free, functional activator $[A]_{\\text{free}}$ is available to bind to its target promoter only after all repressor molecules have been titrated. Consequently, the concentration of free activator is given by $[A]_{\\text{free}} = [A] - R_0$ if $[A] > R_0$, and $[A]_{\\text{free}} = 0$ otherwise.
