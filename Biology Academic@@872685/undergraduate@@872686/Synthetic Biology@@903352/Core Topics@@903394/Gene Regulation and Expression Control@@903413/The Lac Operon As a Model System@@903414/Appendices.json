This exercise explores a foundational concept by examining a mutant strain where the repressor protein cannot bind to its target DNA sequence, the operator. By predicting the operon's behavior in the presence and absence of lactose, you will solidify your understanding of how operator sites function as critical 'off' switches in gene regulation [@problem_id:1473268].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating gene regulation in *Escherichia coli* using the lac operon as a model system. The wild-type operon is inducible: in a growth medium where glucose is absent, the structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*) are transcribed at a high level only when lactose is present.\n\nThe biologist identifies a mutant strain that has a single point mutation in the operator region of the lac operon. This mutation is designated as $O^c$ (operator constitutive). This alteration to the DNA sequence of the operator prevents the LacI repressor protein, which is produced by the *lacI* gene, from binding to it. Assume all other components of the operon, including the promoter, the *lacI* gene itself, and the structural genes, are fully functional.\n\nThe biologist cultures this $O^c$ mutant strain in two different liquid media, both of which completely lack glucose.\n- **Condition 1:** The medium does not contain any lactose.\n- **Condition 2:** The medium contains a high concentration of lactose.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the expected level of transcription of the lac operon's structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*) for this $O^c$ mutant strain in Condition 1 and Condition 2, respectively?\n\nA.

Low transcription in Condition 1 / Low transcription in Condition 2\n\nD. High transcription in Condition 1 / Low transcription in Condition 2\n\nE. No transcription in Condition 1 / No transcription in Condition 2", "solution": "Principle of lac operon control in wild type: Negative control by LacI repressor and positive control by CAP–cAMP. In the absence of lactose, LacI binds the operator and blocks RNA polymerase, yielding low transcription. In the presence of lactose, allolactose (inducer) binds LacI, preventing operator binding and relieving repression; when glucose is absent, cAMP is high, CAP–cAMP binds upstream and activates RNA polymerase for high transcription.\n\nDefinition of the $O^{c}$ mutation: A mutation in the operator that prevents LacI binding to the operator. Because the operator is the DNA site for repressor binding, an $O^{c}$ allele eliminates negative control by LacI regardless of inducer presence. The promoter, $lacI$, and structural genes are otherwise functional.\n\nApply to the two conditions (both lack glucose):\n- Condition 1 (no lactose): In $O^{c}$, LacI cannot bind the operator even without inducer, so there is no repression. Since glucose is absent, cAMP is high and CAP–cAMP activates transcription. Therefore, transcription of $lacZ$, $lacY$, and $lacA$ is high.\n- Condition 2 (high lactose): As above, the operator cannot bind LacI, so repression is absent. With glucose absent, CAP–cAMP activates transcription. Therefore, transcription is high.\n\nConclusion: High transcription in Condition 1 and High transcription in Condition 2, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1473268"}, {"introduction": "Genetic regulation often involves the interplay between components that act locally on the DNA and those that can diffuse throughout the cell. This practice uses a classic partial diploid setup to test your ability to distinguish between *cis*-acting elements (like the operator) and *trans*-acting factors (like the repressor protein). Mastering this distinction is fundamental for designing predictable and modular synthetic circuits where parts from different DNA molecules must work together [@problem_id:1473290].", "problem": "A bioengineering student is designing a synthetic gene circuit in *Escherichia coli* to control the production of an enzyme. The student creates a partial diploid strain of *E. coli* using an F' plasmid. The genotype of the bacterial chromosome is $I^+ O^+ Z^-$, while the genotype of the F' plasmid is $I^- O^+ Z^+$.\n\nThe components of this system are defined as follows:\n- The lacI gene ($I$) codes for a repressor protein. The allele $I^+$ produces a functional repressor, while $I^-$ produces a non-functional repressor.\n- The operator ($O$) is a segment of DNA to which the repressor protein binds. The allele $O^+$ is a normal operator site.\n- The lacZ gene ($Z$) codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase. The allele $Z^+$ produces functional β-galactosidase, while $Z^-$ produces a non-functional version of the enzyme.\n\nThe repressor protein binds to the operator to block transcription. Lactose (or its metabolite, allolactose) can bind to the functional repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator.\n\nBased on this genetic arrangement, which of the following statements correctly describes the production of functional β-galactosidase in this partial diploid cell?\n\nA. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, and this synthesis is inducible by lactose.\n\nB. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, but its synthesis is constitutive (occurs regardless of the presence of lactose).\n\nC. No functional β-galactosidase is synthesized under any condition.\n\nD. No functional β-galactosidase is synthesized because the functional repressor protein produced from the $I^+$ allele can only act on the adjacent $Z^−$ gene on the chromosome.\n\nE. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, but only in the absence of lactose.", "solution": "The chromosomal genotype is $I^{+} O^{+} Z^{-}$ and the F' plasmid genotype is $I^{-} O^{+} Z^{+}$. The molecular logic of the lac system required here is as follows: the product of $I$ (the LacI repressor) is a trans-acting diffusible protein; the operator $O$ is a cis-acting DNA site; a functional repressor (from $I^{+}$) binds to an $O^{+}$ operator to block transcription; lactose (or allolactose) binds a functional repressor to prevent its operator binding and thereby induces transcription. The $Z^{+}$ allele produces functional β-galactosidase when transcribed, whereas $Z^{-}$ cannot produce functional enzyme.\n\nFrom $I^{+} O^{+} Z^{-}$ on the chromosome, a functional LacI repressor is produced. Because LacI is trans-acting, the repressor diffuses and can bind to any $O^{+}$ operator in the cell, including both the chromosomal $O^{+}$ and the plasmid $O^{+}$. The plasmid $I^{-}$ produces no functional repressor and does not interfere (there is no dominant negative specified). Therefore, in the absence of lactose, the functional repressor from $I^{+}$ binds both $O^{+}$ sites and blocks transcription from both operons. Under these conditions, the chromosomal $Z^{-}$ cannot produce functional enzyme regardless, and the plasmid $Z^{+}$ is repressed, so no functional β-galactosidase is synthesized.\n\nIn the presence of lactose (or allolactose), the inducer binds the functional LacI repressor and prevents its binding to $O^{+}$. With the operators unoccupied, transcription proceeds from both operons. The chromosomal $Z^{-}$ still cannot produce functional enzyme, but the plasmid $Z^{+}$ is transcribed and translated into functional β-galactosidase. Thus, functional enzyme is synthesized only when lactose is present, i.e., synthesis is inducible.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, and this synthesis is inducible by lactose. This matches option A and rules out: B (would require $O^{c}$ or no functional $I$), C (contradicted by inducible expression from $Z^{+}$ on the plasmid), D (incorrectly asserts the repressor acts only in cis), and E (inverted regulation).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1473290"}, {"introduction": "The function of regulatory proteins like the LacI repressor is not just about binding DNA; it's also about responding to environmental signals through allosteric changes. This problem investigates a special type of mutant repressor, a 'super-repressor,' that can bind the operator but has lost its ability to sense the inducer. Analyzing this scenario reveals the critical importance of allostery in creating a functional, switchable genetic system and provides insight into how protein engineering can be used to create new regulatory behaviors [@problem_id:2075968].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist engineers a strain of *Escherichia coli* to act as a biosensor. The design is based on the well-studied lactose (lac) operon. The engineered strain contains a plasmid with a synthetic operon where the structural genes of the lac operon have been replaced by a gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The expression of GFP is under the control of a standard `lac` promoter and operator (`lacO`) sequence.\n\nThe chromosome of this host *E. coli* strain has been modified. Its native *lacI* gene has been replaced with a mutant allele, denoted `$lacI^s$`. This `$lacI^s$` allele produces a mutant LacI repressor protein (LacI$^s$). The LacI$^s$ protein functions differently from the wild-type LacI protein: it can bind normally and tightly to the `lacO` operator site, but its allosteric site for the inducer is non-functional, meaning it cannot bind to Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), a common molecular analog of allolactose.\n\nThe engineered cells are cultured in two different environments to test their response:\n- **Medium 1**: A minimal medium containing glucose as the primary carbon source.\n- **Medium 2**: A minimal medium containing glycerol as the primary carbon source, supplemented with a high concentration of IPTG.\n\nFor context, recall that glucose metabolism leads to catabolite repression, which suppresses lac operon expression even in the presence of an inducer. Glycerol does not cause catabolite repression.\n\nBased on your understanding of gene regulation, predict the phenotype of the engineered *E. coli* in these two conditions. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected levels of GFP expression?\n\nA. GFP expression will be at a basal level in Medium 1 and high in Medium 2.\n\nB. GFP expression will be at a basal level in both Medium 1 and Medium 2.\n\nC. GFP expression will be high in Medium 1 and high in Medium 2.\n\nD. GFP expression will be high in Medium 1 and at a basal level in Medium 2.\n\nE. GFP expression will be at a basal level in Medium 1 and at an intermediate level in Medium 2.", "solution": "1) Core regulatory architecture:\n- The synthetic operon uses the standard lac promoter-operator module. Transcription is negatively regulated by repressor binding at the operator ($lacO$) and positively influenced by the cAMP-CAP complex when catabolite repression is relieved. Thus, transcriptional output is high only when the repressor is not bound to $lacO$ and when cAMP-CAP is present; it is basal when the repressor is bound to $lacO$ (tight repression with possible minimal leak), regardless of the cAMP-CAP state.\n- Wild-type LacI is inactivated by inducer (e.g., IPTG), which prevents it from binding $lacO$. In contrast, the `$lacI^s$` (superrepressor) allele produces a repressor that binds $lacO$ but cannot bind inducer. Therefore, `$lacI^s$` keeps the operator occupied irrespective of inducer concentration.\n\n2) Consequence of `$lacI^s$` on the plasmid-borne lac promoter:\n- The chromosomally expressed `$lacI^s$` protein diffuses and binds the plasmid’s $lacO$, maintaining repression.\n- Because `$lacI^s$` cannot bind IPTG, no inducer can relieve repression; the repressor remains operator-bound in all tested environments.\n\n3) Effects of carbon sources and catabolite repression:\n- Medium 1 (glucose): Catabolite repression lowers cAMP, reducing CAP activation. Even if the repressor were absent, expression would be low. With `$lacI^s$` bound at $lacO$, transcription is repressed to basal leak.\n- Medium 2 (glycerol + IPTG): Glycerol does not cause catabolite repression, so cAMP-CAP is active and could enhance transcription if the operator were free. However, IPTG cannot inactivate `$lacI^s$`, so the operator remains occupied and transcription remains at basal leak.\n\n4) Predicted GFP phenotypes:\n- Medium 1: Basal expression due to repressor binding and catabolite repression.\n- Medium 2: Basal expression due to persistent `$lacI^s$` binding despite high IPTG; activation by cAMP-CAP cannot overcome an occupied operator.\n\nTherefore, GFP expression is at a basal level in both conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2075968"}]}
