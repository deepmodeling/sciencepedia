To direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific location in the vast expanse of a genome, we use a guide RNA (gRNA), which acts as a molecular GPS. This exercise [@problem_id:2024509] puts you in the role of a synthetic biologist tasked with the fundamental first step of any gene editing experiment: designing the correct gRNA. Successfully completing this task requires a precise understanding of the rules that govern Cas9 targeting, including the location of the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) and its relationship to the gRNA sequence and the final cleavage site.", "problem": "A researcher in a synthetic biology lab is working with the CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9) to modify a target gene. The goal is to insert a fluorescent protein tag immediately after the protein's initial methionine, which corresponds to the `ATG` start codon on the coding strand of the DNA. To achieve this, a precise double-strand break must be created by the Cas9 nuclease immediately following the `ATG` triplet.\n\nThe 5' end of the gene's coding sequence is provided below. The top strand is the coding (non-target) strand, and the bottom strand is the template (target) strand.\n\nCoding Strand: `5’- GCT AGA CCG TTA CGA GCC ATG CGA TGG CTA AAG -3’`\nTemplate Strand: `3’- CGA TCT GGC AAT GCT CGG TAC GCT ACC GAT TTC -5’`\n\nThe activity of the SpCas9-gRNA (guide RNA) complex follows these rules:\n1.  Cas9 recognizes a 3-nucleotide sequence called the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), which has the sequence `5'-NGG-3'` on the non-target DNA strand.\n2.  The gRNA contains a 20-nucleotide spacer region that directs the complex to the desired location. The sequence of this gRNA spacer is identical to the 20-nucleotide DNA sequence on the non-target strand located immediately upstream (5') of the PAM, with the exception that Thymine (T) is replaced by Uracil (U).\n3.  The Cas9 nuclease cleaves both DNA strands exactly 3 base pairs upstream (5') of the PAM sequence.\n\nWhich of the following represents the correct 5' to 3' sequence for the 20-nucleotide gRNA spacer required to create the double-strand break immediately following the `ATG` start codon?\n\nA. `5'-GACCGUUACGAGCCAUGCGA-3'`\n\nB. `5'-GACCGTTACGAGCCATGCGA-3'`\n\nC. `5'-TCGCATGGCTCGTAACGGTC-3'`\n\nD. `5'-UCGCAUGGCUCGUAACGGUC-3'`\n\nE. `5'-AGCAUGCCGAGCUUCAAGGCAG-3'`", "solution": "We want SpCas9 to cut immediately after the coding-strand start codon ATG. The coding (non-target) strand is:\n5'-GCTAGACCGTTACGAGCCATGCGATGGCTAAAG-3'\nIndexing bases from left to right as positions $1,2,\\dots$, the ATG is at positions $19$–$21$, so the desired cut is between positions $21$ and $22$.\n\nFor SpCas9 with a PAM on the non-target (coding) strand:\n- The PAM is $5'$-NGG-$3'$ on the non-target strand.\n- The $20$-nt spacer is identical to the $20$ nucleotides immediately upstream (5') of the PAM on the non-target strand, with T replaced by U in the RNA.\n- The cleavage site is exactly $3$ bp upstream of the PAM, i.e., between bases at indices $p-4$ and $p-3$ on the non-target strand if the PAM starts at index $p$.\n\nWe therefore require the cut between positions $21$ and $22$, which implies\n$$p-4=21 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p-3=22 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad p=25.$$\nThus the PAM must begin at position $25$ on the coding strand.

This PAM sequence acts as a critical checkpoint, and its absence at a target site will prevent cleavage, regardless of how perfectly the gRNA matches the DNA. This practice [@problem_id:2288701] challenges you to predict the outcome of an experiment where this crucial rule is overlooked, reinforcing the absolutely essential role of the PAM in enabling Cas9 activity.", "problem": "A research team is attempting to disrupt a specific gene in a mammalian cell line using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system derived from *Streptococcus pyogenes*. The system comprises the Cas9 nuclease and a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA). The targeting portion of the sgRNA is designed to be perfectly complementary to a 20-nucleotide sequence within the target gene. However, upon reviewing their experimental design, the researchers realize that the 3-nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the target DNA sequence on the non-target strand is 5'-CTA-3'. The Cas9 nuclease from *Streptococcus pyogenes* requires a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence, which is 5'-NGG-3' (where N can be any nucleotide), to be present immediately downstream of the target for its activity.\n\nAssuming the sgRNA and Cas9 protein are successfully delivered into the cells and are fully functional, what is the most likely outcome at the intended target site?\n\nA. The Cas9-sgRNA complex will bind to the target site and cleave the DNA, but with significantly lower efficiency compared to a site with a canonical PAM sequence.\n\nB. The Cas9-sgRNA complex will be unable to stably bind to the target site, and therefore, no DNA cleavage will occur.\n\nC. The Cas9-sgRNA complex will ignore the intended target site and instead cause a double-strand break at a random off-target location within the genome.\n\nD. The Cas9-sgRNA complex will bind to the target site but will only create a single-strand break (a nick) in the DNA instead of a double-strand break.\n\nE. The Cas9-sgRNA complex will successfully bind and cleave the DNA, as the perfect complementarity between the sgRNA and the target DNA sequence is sufficient for nuclease activity.", "solution": "The Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes requires a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence of the form 5'-NGG-3' on the non-target strand immediately downstream of the 20-nucleotide protospacer for stable binding and subsequent cleavage. Mechanistically, Cas9 first scans DNA for the PAM; only upon PAM recognition does it locally unwind DNA and test for complementarity between the sgRNA spacer and the protospacer. In the absence of an appropriate PAM, Cas9 does not stably bind and does not initiate R-loop formation, so complementarity alone is not sufficient to trigger cleavage.\n\nIn the given design, the sequence immediately downstream of the target on the non-target strand is 5'-CTA-3', which does not match the canonical 5'-NGG-3' PAM required by Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. Although some noncanonical PAMs such as 5'-NAG-3' can be weakly tolerated, 5'-CTA-3' is not among them. Therefore, at the intended target site, the Cas9-sgRNA complex will fail to stably bind and no double-strand break will occur.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because lack of PAM prevents productive binding rather than merely reducing efficiency.\n- B is correct: without the proper PAM, stable binding and cleavage do not occur.\n- C is incorrect because Cas9 does not cleave randomly; off-target cuts require both a PAM and sufficient sequence complementarity at specific genomic loci.\n- D is incorrect because SpCas9 requires PAM to bind and catalyze cleavage; nicking would require engineered nickase variants and a PAM.\n- E is incorrect because perfect complementarity alone is insufficient; the PAM is essential.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome at the intended target site is no stable binding and no cleavage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2288701"}, {"introduction": "Once Cas9 has been guided to its target and has recognized a valid PAM, it uses two distinct nuclease domains, HNH and RuvC, to create the signature double-strand break.

The system comprises the Cas9 protein, an endonuclease, and a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the protein to a specific target sequence in a DNA molecule. The wild-type Cas9 protein possesses two distinct nuclease domains that work in concert to cleave the DNA: the HNH domain and the RuvC domain. By convention, the DNA strand that is complementary to the gRNA's spacer sequence is called the \"target strand,\" and the other strand is the \"non-target strand.\" In a standard cleavage event, the HNH domain cuts the target strand, while the RuvC domain cuts the non-target strand, resulting in a Double-Strand Break (DSB).\n\nConsider a scenario where a synthetic biologist has created a mutant version of the Cas9 protein.

Binding to gRNA and target DNA is unaffected, so targeting and R-loop formation proceed normally.\n- Upon binding to the correct target, the active HNH domain will cleave the target strand, but the inactive RuvC domain cannot cleave the non-target strand. Therefore, only one strand is cut, producing a single-strand break (nick) specifically in the target strand.\n- Evaluating options:\n  - A is false because a double-strand break requires both HNH and RuvC activities.\n  - B is false because HNH is active and will cleave the target strand.\n  - C is false because the non-target strand is cut by RuvC, which is inactive.\n  - D is false because binding functions are intact.\n  - E is true: a nick in the target strand is produced.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2024478"}]}
