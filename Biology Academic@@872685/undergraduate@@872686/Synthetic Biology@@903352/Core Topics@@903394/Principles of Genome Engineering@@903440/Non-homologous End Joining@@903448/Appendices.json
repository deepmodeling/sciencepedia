The 5' to 3' sequence of the coding strand for the beginning of this gene's first exon is as follows:\n\n`5'-ATG GGC CGA TTT AGC GTC-...-3'`\n\nThe `ATG` codon serves as the start codon, establishing the initial reading frame for translation. During the experiment, a precise double-strand break is induced immediately following the 9th nucleotide from the 5' end.

A double-strand break occurs immediately after the 9th nucleotide (between nucleotides 9 and 10), i.e., between codons 3 and 4 in the original frame, and NHEJ inserts the four-nucleotide sequence `GCTA` at this junction. Therefore, the repaired sequence at the start becomes `ATG GGC CGA GCTA TTT AGC GTC-...`, with the reading frame still starting at the original `ATG` and proceeding in successive triplets.\n\nReading codons from the repaired sequence:\n- The first three codons before the break remain unchanged:\n  - Codon 1: `ATG` translates to Methionine (Met).\n  - Codon 2: `GGC` translates to Glycine (Gly).\n  - Codon 3: `CGA` translates to Arginine (Arg).\n- The insertion contributes the next codons in the established frame:\n  - Codon 4: `GCT` (first three bases of the insertion) translates to Alanine (Ala).\n  - Codon 5: `ATT` (last base of the insertion `A` plus original positions 10 and 11, `T` and `T`) translates to Isoleucine (Ile).\n- The next codon from the shifted frame is `TAG` (original positions 12, 13, 14), which is a stop codon.

The strategy involves targeting the first exon of the gene of interest to introduce a frameshift mutation. The guide RNA (gRNA) is designed to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific site. The DNA sequence of the target region in a wild-type (WT) cell is:\n\nWT Sequence: `5'-AATTGCTAGG CATAGCAGTC GACTGAATAG GCTTACGTAT-3'`\n\nThe Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence is `CGG` (not shown in the provided strand, but located adjacently). The Cas9 nuclease creates a blunt double-strand break (DSB) exactly 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM sequence, which corresponds to the space between nucleotides `C` and `G` in the `...TCG ACT...` part of the sequence. The cut site is therefore `...TC | GACT...`.\n\nAfter transfecting the cells with the CRISPR-Cas9 components, the researcher waits for 72 hours, isolates genomic DNA from the entire population of treated cells, and uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify a 200 base pair region centered on the target site. This PCR product is then submitted for Sanger sequencing using a primer that anneals upstream of the target site.\n\nThe sequencing results are as follows:\n- The WT control sample (from untransfected cells) yields a clean, high-quality sequence that perfectly matches the expected WT sequence.\n- The sample from the CRISPR-treated cell population yields a sequence that is clean and perfectly matches the WT sequence up to the nucleotide `C` immediately preceding the cut site (`...TC`). However, starting from the position immediately following the cut site, the sequencing chromatogram becomes unreadable, showing multiple overlapping peaks of roughly equal intensity for all four bases (A, T, C, G) for the remainder of the readable sequence.\n\nBased on this sequencing result from the cell population, which of the following cellular DNA repair processes was most likely the dominant mechanism acting on the Cas9-induced DSBs?\n\nA.

The Cas9-gRNA complex induces a blunt double-strand break (DSB) exactly 3 nucleotides upstream of the PAM. Given the provided mapping, the cut occurs at the boundary indicated as `...TC | GACT...`, i.e., after the cytosine immediately upstream of the break. The researcher amplifies a mixed population of alleles from many cells using PCR and sequences with a primer annealing upstream of the cut site. Sanger sequencing of a mixed amplicon pool yields a superposition of signals from all alleles present; positions where all templates are identical yield clean peaks, whereas positions where the pool contains heterogeneous sequences yield overlapping peaks.\n\nDeduce what each repair mechanism would produce in the Sanger trace:\n1. If there were complete failure to cut or perfectly error-free repair restoring the wild type, the entire chromatogram would remain clean and match the wild-type sequence throughout, not just up to the cut site. Therefore, both “no cut” and “error-free repair” predict a uniformly clean WT trace from start to finish, which contradicts the observed unreadable mixture starting precisely at the cut site.\n2. If HDR using a precise exogenous template were the dominant pathway, the majority of templates would be identically modified according to the donor sequence. This would yield a clean chromatogram matching the donor (or a clean, systematic change) starting at or near the cut site, not a mixed set of overlapping peaks of roughly equal intensity for all four bases.\n3. If there were a consistent, large-scale deletion over approximately $10^2$ base pairs in all edited cells, then either the PCR would fail (if a primer site were deleted), or, if the amplicon were still produced, the Sanger read would shift uniformly after the breakpoint, producing a clean but altered sequence (e.g., shorter read or a clean junction), not a heterogeneous superposition. A uniform large deletion does not produce pervasive base ambiguity across the population; it produces a consistent, clean alternative sequence.\n\nRelate the observation to Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is the predominant DSB repair pathway in human cells in the absence of a homologous template. It frequently introduces small insertions and deletions (indels) at the break site. In a pooled sample:\n- Upstream of the cut site, all alleles are identical to WT because repair-induced indels occur at or downstream of the cleavage site. Thus the chromatogram is clean and matches WT to the nucleotide immediately before the cut.\n- Immediately after the cut, different alleles carry different indels (varied sizes and sequences), causing the Sanger sequencing reaction to superimpose signals from many divergent templates. This yields overlapping peaks of similar intensity for all four bases, starting exactly at the first base after the break.\n\nTherefore, the specific pattern—clean WT sequence until the cut site, followed by unreadable, multi-peak signal for the remainder—most strongly indicates heterogeneous indels created by NHEJ acting on the Cas9-induced DSBs across the cell population.\n\nConclude that the dominant repair process is Non-Homologous End Joining.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2051571"}, {"introduction": "The NHEJ pathway is a coordinated effort involving a cascade of specialized proteins, each with a critical function. This advanced practice challenges you to think about the molecular machinery in detail by predicting the consequences of removing a key enzymatic component, the nuclease Artemis.[@problem_id:2051588] Such thought experiments are essential for dissecting complex biological pathways and for designing sophisticated strategies to manipulate them for therapeutic or research purposes.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment designed to study DNA repair mechanisms, a researcher utilizes a genetically modified human cell line. This cell line has a complete knockout of the gene encoding the nuclease **Artemis**. Using an advanced gene-editing tool, the researcher induces a high number of targeted Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) within non-coding regions of the genome. The cleavage chemistry of the tool is specifically engineered to produce aberrant DNA ends: each side of the break is sealed into a covalently closed hairpin loop, rendering the ends non-ligatable without further processing. The primary pathway for repairing such DSBs in human cells is Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). Given this scenario, which of the following molecular intermediates is most likely to accumulate at the sites of these induced DSBs in the Artemis-deficient cells?\n\nA. A complex consisting of the Ku70/80 heterodimer and the DNA-dependent Protein Kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), stably bound to unopened DNA hairpin ends.\n\nB. Free, protein-unbound DNA ends with intact hairpin loop structures.\n\nC.

DNA ends actively undergoing 5' to 3' resection by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex to create single-stranded overhangs for homologous recombination.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the specific molecular intermediate that will accumulate in an Artemis-deficient cell line after the induction of Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) with hairpin ends. To solve this, we must trace the steps of the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway and identify the point at which it is blocked by the absence of Artemis.\n\n**Step 1: Initiation of NHEJ**\nThe very first event following the creation of a DSB is the rapid recognition and binding of the broken DNA ends by the Ku70/80 heterodimer. This protein acts as the primary sensor for DSBs. Ku has a ring-like structure that allows it to thread onto the DNA ends, regardless of their specific chemical structure (blunt, overhang, or complex like a hairpin). Therefore, the hairpin-sealed ends will be quickly bound by Ku. This makes option (B), free protein-unbound DNA ends, incorrect as Ku binding is a highly efficient and rapid initial step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the DNA-PK Holoenzyme**\nOnce the Ku heterodimer is bound to the DNA ends, it serves as a scaffold to recruit the DNA-dependent Protein Kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). The association of Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs on the DNA end forms the active DNA-PK holoenzyme. This large complex serves two main purposes: it protects the DNA ends from degradation and it acts as a kinase to phosphorylate downstream targets, orchestrating the subsequent repair steps.\n\n**Step 3: Requirement for End Processing**\nThe ultimate goal of NHEJ is to ligate the broken ends together using DNA Ligase IV. However, DNA Ligase IV can only join compatible DNA ends (e.g., blunt ends or compatible sticky ends). The hairpin loops created in this scenario are covalently closed structures and are non-ligatable. They must first be processed—specifically, opened—to generate a standard 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate that the ligase can act upon.\n\n**Step 4: The Role of Artemis**\nThe key enzyme responsible for processing complex, non-ligatable ends in the NHEJ pathway is the nuclease Artemis. While Artemis has some intrinsic exonuclease activity, its critical endonuclease activity, which is required to open hairpin loops, is only activated upon being recruited to the DSB site and phosphorylated by the active DNA-PKcs. Artemis then cleaves the hairpin, opening it up for further processing and eventual ligation.\n\n**Step 5: The Consequence of Artemis Deficiency**\nIn the described cell line, the Artemis protein is absent due to a gene knockout. Consequently, after the Ku and DNA-PKcs proteins have assembled at the hairpin-sealed ends, the pathway is arrested. The necessary endonuclease is not present to open the hairpins. The DNA-PK complex will remain stably associated with the unopened hairpin ends, but the repair process cannot proceed further. This stalled structure is the molecular intermediate that will accumulate. This matches the description in option (A).\n\n**Step 6: Evaluating the Other Options**\n- Option (C) and (D) describe later stages of the NHEJ pathway. A pre-ligation complex (C) or a synaptic complex (D) can only be formed *after* the DNA ends have been successfully processed by Artemis to become ligatable. Since Artemis is absent, the pathway never reaches these stages.\n- Option (E) describes the initiation of a different repair pathway, Homologous Recombination (HR), which typically involves end resection by the MRN complex. While there is competition between NHEJ and HR, the canonical and much faster response to a DSB (especially outside of S/G2 phase) is the binding of Ku. The question asks what intermediate accumulates within the context of the primary pathway being attempted. The direct consequence of the Artemis block in the NHEJ pathway is the accumulation of the stalled DNA-PK/hairpin complex. While these stalled breaks might eventually be shunted to another pathway, the most direct and prominent accumulated species from the blocked canonical NHEJ pathway is the one described in (A).\n\nTherefore, the most likely accumulated intermediate is the complex of Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs bound to the intact, unopened DNA hairpin loops.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2051588"}]}
