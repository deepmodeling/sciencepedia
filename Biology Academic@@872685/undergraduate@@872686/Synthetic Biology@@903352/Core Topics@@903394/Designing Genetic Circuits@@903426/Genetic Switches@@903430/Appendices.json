The engineered genetic circuit is designed such that the pollutant molecule acts as an inducer, binding to a transcriptional activator protein and initiating the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The fractional activation of the gene promoter, denoted by $Y$, which corresponds to the normalized fluorescence level, is well-described by the Hill equation for an activator:\n\n$$Y = \\frac{[L]^{n}}{K_{M}^{n} + [L]^{n}}$$\n\nHere, $[L]$ is the concentration of the pollutant (the ligand), $K_{M}$ is the ligand concentration that yields half-maximal activation, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which describes the cooperativity of the binding process.\n\nFor this specific biosensor design, the activator protein dimerizes before binding to the DNA, resulting in a Hill coefficient of $n=2$. The engineers want to calibrate the sensor and determine the concentration of the pollutant that corresponds to a \"high-level\" detection signal, which they define as 90% of the maximum possible promoter activation.\n\nDetermine the exact concentration of the pollutant, $[L]$, required to achieve 90% activation. Express your answer as a multiple of $K_{M}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the concentration of the pollutant, $[L]$, that results in a fractional activation of $Y = 0.90$. The relationship between $Y$ and $[L]$ is given by the Hill equation.\n\nThe given Hill equation is:\n$$Y = \\frac{[L]^{n}}{K_{M}^{n} + [L]^{n}}$$\n\nWe are provided with the following values:\n- The desired fractional activation, $Y = 0.90$.\n- The Hill coefficient, $n = 2$.\n\nWe need to solve for $[L]$ in terms of $K_{M}$. Let's substitute the known values into the equation:\n$$0.90 = \\frac{[L]^{2}}{K_{M}^{2} + [L]^{2}}$$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate the term $[L]$. First, multiply both sides by the denominator $(K_{M}^{2} + [L]^{2})$:\n$$0.90 \\cdot (K_{M}^{2} + [L]^{2}) = [L]^{2}$$\n\nDistribute the $0.90$ on the left-hand side:\n$$0.90 K_{M}^{2} + 0.90 [L]^{2} = [L]^{2}$$\n\nNext, we want to group all terms containing $[L]^{2}$ on one side of the equation. We can subtract $0.90 [L]^{2}$ from both sides:\n$$0.90 K_{M}^{2} = [L]^{2} - 0.90 [L]^{2}$$\n$$0.90 K_{M}^{2} = (1 - 0.90) [L]^{2}$$\n$$0.90 K_{M}^{2} = 0.10 [L]^{2}$$\n\nTo solve for $[L]^{2}$, we can divide both sides by $0.10$:\n$$[L]^{2} = \\frac{0.90}{0.10} K_{M}^{2}$$\n$$[L]^{2} = 9 K_{M}^{2}$$\n\nFinally, to solve for $[L]$, we take the square root of both sides. Since concentration must be a positive value, we only consider the positive root:\n$$[L] = \\sqrt{9 K_{M}^{2}}$$\n$$[L] = 3 K_{M}$$\n\nThus, the concentration of the pollutant required to achieve 90% activation is 3 times the half-maximal activation constant $K_{M}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3K_{M}}$$", "id": "2040328"}, {"introduction": "While mathematical models describe *what* a switch does, understanding the molecular components explains *how* it works. Genetic switches are built from proteins with distinct jobs, such as binding to DNA or sensing an inducer.

The system is engineered in a bacterial host.\n\nThe SynthLux system has the following components:\n1.  A gene encoding a repressor protein, which is expressed continuously at a constant level. This repressor protein has two distinct functional domains: a DNA-binding domain (DBD) that recognizes a specific operator sequence, and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) that acts as an allosteric site for an inducer molecule.\n2.  An operon containing the luciferase gene, which is placed downstream of a promoter and an operator sequence.\n\nThe system is designed to function as follows: In the absence of an external inducer molecule, the repressor protein binds to the operator sequence, physically blocking RNA polymerase from transcribing the luciferase gene. This is the 'OFF' state, and the bacteria do not produce light. When a specific inducer molecule is added to the culture medium, it binds to the LBD of the repressor. This binding event causes a conformational change in the repressor protein, drastically lowering its affinity for the operator sequence. The repressor detaches from the DNA, allowing for the transcription of the luciferase gene and subsequent light production. This is the 'ON' state.\n\nA researcher wants to modify the SynthLux system so that it is \"constitutively ON,\" meaning the bacteria produce luciferase continuously, regardless of whether the inducer molecule is present or absent.\n\nWhich of the following single mutational events in the gene encoding the repressor protein would result in a constitutively ON phenotype for the SynthLux system?\n\nA. A missense mutation in the repressor's DNA-binding domain that abolishes its ability to bind to the operator DNA.\n\nB. A missense mutation in the repressor's ligand-binding domain that prevents the inducer from binding to it.\n\nC. A silent mutation in the coding sequence for the repressor protein.\n\nD. A duplication of the entire repressor gene, leading to a twofold increase in the intracellular concentration of repressor protein.\n\nE. A missense mutation in the repressor's ligand-binding domain that significantly increases its affinity for the inducer.", "solution": "Goal: constitutively ON means the operator must be unoccupied by the repressor regardless of inducer presence, so transcription proceeds continuously. In a simple 1:1 binding model between repressor and operator, let $[R]$ denote the free repressor concentration and $K_{d}^{RO}$ the repressor-operator dissociation constant.

In the wild-type design, the inducer binds the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and allosterically increases $K_{d}^{RO}$, reducing DNA binding and turning transcription ON. To make the system constitutively ON (independent of inducer), we must ensure $K_{d}^{RO}\\gg [R]$ at all times; equivalently, abolish operator binding by the repressor so that $P_{\\text{bound}}\\approx 0$ regardless of inducer.\n\nEvaluate each option:\nA. A missense mutation in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) that abolishes operator binding drives $K_{d}^{RO}\\to \\infty$ effectively, yielding $P_{\\text{bound}}\\approx 0$ for any $[R]$. This makes the system constitutively ON.\nB. A missense mutation in the LBD that prevents inducer binding locks the repressor in the high-affinity state (small $K_{d}^{RO}$), so $P_{\\text{bound}}$ remains high without inducer relief. This is constitutively OFF.\nC. A silent mutation does not change the amino acid sequence; the regulatory logic remains inducible and not constitutively ON.\nD. Duplication of the repressor gene increases $[R]$, which increases $P_{\\text{bound}}$ at fixed $K_{d}^{RO}$, biasing toward OFF rather than ON.\nE. Increased affinity of the LBD for the inducer lowers the inducer dissociation constant (call it $K_{d}^{RI}$), facilitating induction when inducer is present, but in the absence of inducer the DBD-operator affinity is unchanged; thus it is not constitutively ON.\n\nTherefore, only option A yields the constitutively ON phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2040309"}, {"introduction": "A genetic switch does not operate in isolation; it is a guest within the complex machinery of a living cell.
