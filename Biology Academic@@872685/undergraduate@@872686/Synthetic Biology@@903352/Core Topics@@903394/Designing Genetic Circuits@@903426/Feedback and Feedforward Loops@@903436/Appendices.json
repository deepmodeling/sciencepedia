Specifically, $\\frac{\\alpha}{K^2} = \\frac{12.5}{100^2} = 0.00125$. The net rate $\\frac{d[P]}{dt} \\approx [P](0.00125[P] - 0.050)$. Since $[P]$ is small and positive, the term in the parenthesis is negative. Thus, $\\frac{d[P]}{dt} < 0$, which means that if the concentration is slightly above zero, it will decrease back towards zero. Therefore, the steady-state at $[P]_0 = 0$ is stable.\n\nSince the steady-states must alternate in stability, we can order them and assign stability:\n1. $[P]_0 = 0$ nM: Stable\n2. $[P]_{-} = 50$ nM: Unstable\n3. $[P]_{+} = 200$ nM: Stable\n\nThe stable steady-states are 0 nM and 200 nM.
