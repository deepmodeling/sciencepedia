The goal is for the circuit to respond only to a sustained environmental signal, filtering out brief, noisy fluctuations. The circuit architecture is a Coherent Type-1 Feed-Forward Loop (C1-FFL).\n\nThe circuit involves three genes:\n1. An input transcription factor, X, which is activated by the environmental signal.\n2. An intermediate protein, Y.\n3. A final output protein, Z (e.g., a fluorescent reporter).\n\nThe regulatory logic is as follows:\n- Protein X activates the production of Protein Y.\n- Protein X also activates the production of Protein Z.\n- Protein Y is also required to activate the production of Protein Z. Therefore, Z is only produced when both X and Y are present above their respective activation thresholds.\n\nLet's model the dynamics of the intermediate protein Y. Assume the system starts with no X, Y, or Z. At time $t=0$, the bacterium is exposed to a short pulse of the environmental signal, causing the concentration of active X to be constant for a duration $T$. After time $T$, the signal is removed, and the concentration of active X immediately returns to zero.\n\nWhen X is present, the rate of production of Y is a constant, $\\alpha$. Protein Y is continuously degraded at a rate proportional to its own concentration, $[Y]$, with a first-order rate constant $\\beta$. The concentration of Y at time $t=0$ is zero.\n\nThe circuit is designed such that the production of Z requires the concentration of Y to exceed a threshold $K_Y$. For this particular short pulse of duration $T$, the concentration of Y never reaches this threshold.\n\nDerive a complete, piecewise expression for the concentration of protein Y, denoted as $[Y](t)$, for all times $t \\ge 0$.", "solution": "We model the intermediate protein concentration $[Y](t)$ with a first-order linear ODE whose production term depends on the presence of $X$. For $0 \\le t \\le T$, the environmental signal activates $X$, so the production rate of $Y$ is constant $\\alpha$. Degradation is first order with rate constant $\\beta$. Thus, for $0 \\le t \\le T$,\n$$\n\\frac{d[Y]}{dt}=\\alpha-\\beta [Y], \\quad [Y](0)=0.\n$$\nThis is a linear ODE.

The circuit consists of three genes encoding proteins X, Y, and Z. The system is controlled by an external inducer molecule, which, when present, activates the master transcription factor X. Protein X, in turn, performs two functions: it activates the transcription of gene Y, and it also directly binds to the promoter of gene Z. The protein Y, once produced, also acts as a transcription factor that activates gene Z. Thus, the activation of Z is regulated by both X and Y.\n\nLet's model the temporal dynamics with the following simplified assumptions:\n1.  When the inducer is added at time $t=0$, protein X becomes active instantaneously.\n2.  There is a characteristic time delay, $\\tau_{Y}$, for the production of a functional concentration of protein Y after X becomes active.\n3.  There is a characteristic time delay, $\\tau_{Z}$, for the production of a functional concentration of protein Z after its promoter becomes fully activated. This delay is the same regardless of the activation pathway.\n4.  If the inducer is removed, protein X is deactivated instantaneously. If an activator (X or Y) is removed from a promoter, it unbinds instantaneously, and production ceases immediately. Protein Y also degrades or becomes inactive instantaneously without activator X.\n\nInitially, the circuit is in an 'off' state (no X, Y, or Z). At $t=0$, the inducer is added to the system and then removed at a later time $t = T_{\\text{pulse}}$.\n\nThe promoter of gene Z is engineered to function as a logical AND gate, meaning transcription of Z is initiated only when *both* protein X and protein Y are simultaneously present and active at the promoter.\n\nDetermine the minimum pulse duration $T_{\\text{pulse,min}}$ of the inducer that is required to produce any amount of protein Z.

In the presence of arabinose, AraC forms an active complex that functions as a transcriptional activator.\n2.  The gene for an engineered transcriptional activator, `lacI*`. This protein is a fusion of the LacI DNA-binding domain with a strong transcriptional activation domain. It binds to the standard `lacO` operator sequence but, unlike wild-type LacI, it strongly *activates* gene expression from an adjacent promoter.\n3.  The gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (`gfp`), which will serve as the reporter output.\n4.  A collection of promoters:\n    *   `pBAD`: An arabinose-inducible promoter, activated by the active AraC-arabinose complex.\n    *   `pLacO`: A minimal promoter construct containing a `lacO` operator site.
