Because DNA molecules of different lengths have different masses, simply mixing equal weights will not work; we must instead calculate the masses needed to achieve a specific molar ratio.

The linearized plasmid vector has a length of 4.0 kilobase pairs (kb), and the biologist will use 100.0 nanograms (ng) of this vector in the reaction mixture. The Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) insert, which contains the gene of interest, has a length of 1.0 kb. To ensure efficient assembly, a molar ratio of insert to vector of 2:1 is required.

To truly grasp the method, it is crucial to understand the unique role of each enzymatic player. This exercise challenges you to think like a molecular detective by predicting the outcome of an assembly where a key enzyme, DNA ligase, is missing, thereby revealing its critical function in finalizing the plasmid [@problem_id:2040899].", "problem": "A student is performing a Gibson Assembly cloning experiment. The goal is to insert a gene, amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), into a linearized plasmid vector. The ends of the linear vector and the PCR-amplified insert have been designed to have 25-base-pair regions of homology with each other. The student sets up the reaction with the vector, the insert, and a Gibson Assembly master mix. However, due to a manufacturing error, the master mix completely lacks DNA ligase, but contains all other necessary components in their correct concentrations: a 5' exonuclease, a DNA polymerase, and the appropriate reaction buffer with dNTPs. Assuming the reaction is allowed to proceed to completion under standard conditions, what is the primary molecular product that will be formed in the reaction tube?\n\nA. A covalently closed, supercoiled circular plasmid containing the insert.\n\nB. A nicked, circular, double-stranded plasmid held together by hydrogen bonds at the assembly junctions.\n\nC. A mixture of the original linear vector and linear insert, with no assembly having occurred.\n\nD. A long, linear concatemer formed by the repeated end-to-end joining of vectors and inserts.\n\nE. Primarily single-stranded DNA fragments corresponding to the original vector and insert pieces.", "solution": "Gibson Assembly relies on three coordinated enzymatic activities acting on fragments that share homologous ends:\n1) A 5' exonuclease resects the 5' ends of both the linear vector and the PCR insert to generate complementary single-stranded 3' overhangs across the designed 25-base-pair homology regions.\n2) These complementary single-stranded regions anneal by base pairing, producing a circular arrangement when the insert bridges the two ends of the vector. At this stage, the backbones across the junctions are discontinuous (there are gaps and potential nicks).\n3) A DNA polymerase extends from the available 3' hydroxyl ends, filling in any single-stranded gaps created by the exonuclease and annealing steps. When polymerase encounters the upstream strand, it cannot seal the pre-existing nick; only a DNA ligase can form the missing phosphodiester bonds to make the backbone continuous.\n\nIn the given reaction, DNA ligase is entirely absent. Therefore, although the exonuclease-mediated annealing and polymerase-mediated gap filling proceed to completion, the strand discontinuities at each assembly junction remain as nicks. The resulting predominant product is a circular, double-stranded plasmid in which the insert is correctly positioned and the sequence is base-paired across the junctions, but the phosphodiester backbone remains unsealed at those junctions. Such a molecule is referred to as a nicked circular plasmid held together by hydrogen bonding (base pairing) across the assembly junctions.\n\nThis rules out:\n- A: Covalently closed (and supercoiled) circular DNA requires ligase; supercoiling is not produced by this in vitro mix and, in any case, covalent closure is absent here.\n- C: Assembly does occur because exonuclease, annealing, and polymerase are present.\n- D: Concatemerization is disfavored with specific 25-base-pair homology design intended for a single insert; without ligase, even if multimeric annealing occurred, covalent joining would not happen.\n- E: The polymerase fills in gaps, so the predominant species is double-stranded rather than single-stranded.\n\nThus, the primary product is a nicked, circular, double-stranded plasmid held together by hydrogen bonds at the assembly junctions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2040899"}, {"introduction": "Once the assembly reaction is complete and bacteria have been transformed, the work is not yet done; you now face a plate of colonies, only some of which contain the correctly assembled plasmid. The next critical step is to efficiently screen these candidates to identify the clones you want. This problem asks you to evaluate common molecular biology workflows and select the most direct method for verifying the size of your newly constructed plasmid, a core skill in genetic engineering [@problem_id:2040914].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is creating a new biosensor by inserting a gene cassette into a plasmid vector. The linearized plasmid vector has a known size of 4.5 kilobases (kb). The gene cassette, which includes the sensor gene and its regulatory elements, is a 1.2 kb DNA fragment. The two pieces are joined using the Gibson assembly method to create a single, circular plasmid. The expected size of the correctly assembled product is therefore 5.7 kb.\n\nThe assembly reaction mixture is then used to transform competent *E. coli* cells, which are subsequently plated on an agar plate containing an appropriate antibiotic for selection. The next day, the plate shows a large number of bacterial colonies. The biologist knows that some of these colonies will contain the correct 5.7 kb plasmid, but others may contain the original 4.5 kb vector that has re-circularized without the insert, or other incorrect assembly products.\n\nBefore proceeding to more expensive and time-consuming steps like DNA sequencing or functional characterization, the biologist needs to perform a rapid and effective initial screening of several colonies to identify which ones are most likely to contain a plasmid of the correct total size.\n\nWhich of the following molecular biology workflows is the most direct and appropriate for this primary screening task?\n\nA. Analyze protein extracts from each colony via a Western blot using an antibody specific to the protein encoded by the sensor gene.\n\nB. Perform a plasmid DNA minipreparation (miniprep) for each selected colony, followed by linearization of the extracted plasmid with a restriction enzyme that cuts only once, and then size analysis using agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nC. Perform Sanger sequencing on the entire plasmid isolated from a randomly selected colony to confirm the complete sequence.\n\nD. Use quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) with primers targeting the antibiotic resistance gene on the vector to measure the plasmid copy number in each colony.\n\nE. Directly measure the output signal of the biosensor (e.g., fluorescence or color change) from each colony on the plate.", "solution": "Goal: Rapidly and directly distinguish colonies carrying a correctly assembled plasmid of total size $5.7$ kb from those carrying the re-circularized vector of $4.5$ kb or other incorrect assemblies, before committing to sequencing or functional assays.\n\nPrinciple 1 (restriction digestion to linearize): A restriction endonuclease that cuts a plasmid exactly once converts the circular plasmid (which may be supercoiled or nicked and migrates anomalously) into a single linear DNA molecule whose length equals the total plasmid size. This eliminates topology-dependent mobility differences on agarose gels.\n\nPrinciple 2 (agarose gel electrophoresis): Agarose gel electrophoresis separates linear double-stranded DNA fragments primarily by length; for a given gel concentration and running conditions, migration distance correlates with the logarithm of fragment length. Thus, after linearization, a $5.7$ kb plasmid will resolve distinctly from a $4.5$ kb plasmid and from other unexpected sizes.\n\nWorkflow evaluation:\n- Option B implements the exact workflow required for a size check: perform a plasmid miniprep from individual colonies, digest each plasmid with a restriction enzyme that cuts only once in the plasmid, and resolve products on an agarose gel. A correct clone will show a single linear band at $5.7$ kb; a re-ligated vector will show a single linear band at $4.5$ kb; other misassemblies will produce bands of other sizes or multiple bands if additional sites are present. This is rapid, inexpensive, and directly measures the total plasmid size.\n- Option A (Western blot) detects protein expression and depends on transcription/translation and assay conditions; it is indirect for plasmid size and is slower and more resource-intensive.\n- Option C (Sanger sequencing of an entire plasmid from one colony) is not an efficient primary screen across multiple colonies and typically requires primer walking; it is more costly and time-consuming than necessary for a simple size check.\n- Option D (qPCR for antibiotic resistance gene) measures abundance, not size, and cannot distinguish the presence or absence of the insert or resolve total plasmid length.\n- Option E (functional readout on plate) is indirect, can yield false negatives if expression fails or conditions are suboptimal, and does not establish plasmid size.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and appropriate primary screening workflow for total plasmid size discrimination is miniprep, single-cutter linearization, and agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2040914"}]}
