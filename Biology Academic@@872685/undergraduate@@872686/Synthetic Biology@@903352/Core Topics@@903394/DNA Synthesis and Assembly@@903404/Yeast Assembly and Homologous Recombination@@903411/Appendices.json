This exercise challenges you to interpret a classic yeast phenotypic screen, connecting the molecular event of homologous recombination at the *ADE2* locus to a distinct change in colony color, allowing you to visually assess the success of a genome integration experiment [@problem_id:2079604].", "problem": "A researcher in a synthetic biology lab is using *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* as a chassis organism. Their goal is to integrate a new synthetic metabolic pathway into the yeast genome. The chosen integration site is the *ADE2* gene, as its disruption provides a convenient color-based screen for successful integration events. The host yeast strain is wild-type for the *ADE2* locus, meaning it has a functional *ADE2* gene.\n\nThe experimental procedure involves transforming the yeast with a set of linear DNA fragments. These fragments consist of a linearized plasmid backbone containing a selectable marker (*URA3*) and the various genes of the new metabolic pathway. The fragments are designed with overlapping ends such that they assemble *in vivo* via homologous recombination into a single, large linear cassette. The two ends of the final assembled cassette are homologous to the regions immediately upstream and downstream of the *ADE2* gene's coding sequence on the yeast chromosome. This design is intended to promote the replacement of the *ADE2* gene with the synthetic pathway cassette through homologous recombination.\n\nAfter the transformation, the cells are plated on a synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (to select for cells that have successfully taken up and assembled the *URA3*-containing fragments) but containing a low concentration of adenine. Following incubation, the researcher observes that a vast majority of the colonies that appear on the plates are deep red.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of this observation?\n\nA. The transformation was highly inefficient, and the red color indicates cellular stress and imminent death.\n\nB. The *in vivo* assembly of the DNA fragments failed, leading to random mutations in the adenine biosynthesis pathway.\n\nC. The experiment was largely successful, indicating that the synthetic pathway was correctly assembled and integrated into the genome at the *ADE2* locus.\n\nD. The assembly of the metabolic pathway into a cassette was successful, but the cassette failed to integrate into the chromosome and is being maintained as an extrachromosomal plasmid.\n\nE. The low-adenine medium used for plating directly caused the inactivation of the *ADE2* gene, independent of the transformed DNA.", "solution": "1) Relevant biological principle: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss-of-function mutations in the adenine biosynthesis gene ADE2 lead to the accumulation of a red pigment precursor that becomes oxidized, producing deep red colonies when grown on medium with low adenine. Therefore, a deep red colony phenotype is a phenotypic marker for disruption of ADE2 function.\n\n2) Experimental design implications: The researcher transformed yeast with linear DNA fragments designed to assemble in vivo via homologous recombination, guided by overlaps between fragments. The final assembled cassette has terminal homology to the chromosomal sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the ADE2 coding region. This architecture is designed to drive a double-crossover event that replaces the endogenous ADE2 open reading frame with the synthetic cassette (a gene replacement), thereby disrupting ADE2 function.\n\n3) Selection logic: Plating on medium lacking uracil selects for cells that carry URA3 within the assembled cassette. Thus, colonies that grow have taken up and maintained the URA3-containing DNA, either integrated into the genome or maintained extrachromosomally. However, the ADE2-associated red phenotype specifically requires loss of ADE2 function, which would occur if the cassette integrates at the ADE2 locus and replaces the coding sequence, but not if the cassette is only maintained as an extrachromosomal plasmid (in which case the native ADE2 remains intact and colonies stay white/cream under these conditions).\n\n4) Observed outcome: A vast majority of colonies are deep red on low-adenine, -Ura medium. This simultaneously indicates:\n- They are URA3-positive (grew without uracil), consistent with successful uptake and assembly of the URA3-containing DNA.\n- They have lost ADE2 function (deep red color), which is most parsimoniously explained by successful homologous integration of the cassette at the ADE2 locus via the designed flanking homology, replacing ADE2.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: Red coloration reflects ADE2 pathway disruption, not nonspecific stress or imminent death.\n- B is unlikely: Random mutations in the adenine pathway would not be expected at high frequency across most colonies; the designed homologous recombination provides a clear mechanistic explanation for the consistent phenotype.\n- C is correct: The data match successful in vivo assembly and targeted integration at ADE2, yielding URA3-positive, ade2-disrupted (red) colonies.\n- D is inconsistent: If the cassette were only extrachromosomal, ADE2 would remain functional and colonies would not be predominantly red under low adenine.\n- E is incorrect: Low-adenine medium does not inactivate ADE2; it reveals the phenotype of ADE2 loss-of-function.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is that the experiment was largely successful, with correct assembly and targeted integration at ADE2 producing the expected red phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2079604"}, {"introduction": "Beyond visual confirmation, robust experimental analysis often requires quantification. This practice demonstrates the critical importance of controls in a DNA assembly experiment [@problem_id:2079601]. By comparing the results of a full assembly with vector-only and negative controls, you will learn to calculate the assembly efficiency, a key metric for distinguishing true recombinant products from experimental background.", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab is performing a yeast assembly experiment to construct a new plasmid. The technique relies on the yeast's native homologous recombination machinery to assemble a linearized expression vector with a gene insert. The vector contains the `URA3` gene, which allows yeast cells that have successfully formed a circular plasmid to grow on a synthetic defined medium that lacks uracil (SD-Ura).\n\nThe student sets up four parallel transformations to characterize the assembly process. An equal volume from each transformation is plated onto an individual SD-Ura plate.\n\n*   **Plate 1 (Full Assembly):** Yeast transformed with the linearized vector and the gene insert.\n*   **Plate 2 (Vector-Only Control):** Yeast transformed with only the linearized vector (no insert).\n*   **Plate 3 (Negative Control):** A mock transformation using sterile water instead of DNA.\n\nAfter incubation, the following colony counts are recorded:\n*   Colonies on Plate 1: 525\n*   Colonies on Plate 2: 35\n*   Colonies on Plate 3: 2\n\nThe \"assembly efficiency\" is a metric used to quantify the success of the recombination, defined as the proportion of colonies from the full assembly (Plate 1) that are true recombinants (i.e., formed from the vector correctly incorporating the insert). The remaining colonies are considered background, primarily arising from the linearized vector re-circularizing on its own without the insert, a process quantified by the vector-only control.\n\nAssuming the background from spontaneous mutation (indicated by Plate 3) is a baseline event that should be accounted for in all DNA-containing transformations, calculate the assembly efficiency.

This scenario presents a common but subtle experimental error: contamination from a PCR template during a yeast transformation [@problem_id:2079558]. By thinking through all the components present in the reaction, you will practice the logical deduction required to identify the source of unintended outcomes and reinforce the importance of purification steps in a cloning workflow.", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab aims to clone a gene called `opt_GFP` (optimized Green Fluorescent Protein), which has a length of 1.2 kilobase pairs (kbp), into a yeast expression vector named `pYEX-DEST` (4.8 kbp). The `pYEX-DEST` vector carries a blasticidin resistance gene (`BsdR`) for selection.\n\nThe cloning strategy is based on in-vivo homologous recombination in yeast. To prepare the necessary DNA fragments, the student performs two steps:\n1.  The circular `pYEX-DEST` vector is linearized by a restriction enzyme that cuts it once at the target insertion site.\n2.  The `opt_GFP` gene is amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The primers are designed to add 40-base-pair homology arms to each end of the gene, which match the sequences flanking the cut site in the linearized `pYEX-DEST`.\n\nThe student makes a critical error in selecting the DNA template for the PCR. The template used is an older plasmid, `pYEX-LEGACY`, which already contains the `opt_GFP` gene. Crucially, `pYEX-LEGACY` was built using the exact same 4.8 kbp backbone as `pYEX-DEST` and therefore also contains the `BsdR` gene.\n\nAfter the PCR is complete, the student takes the entire raw PCR reaction mixture, without any purification or enzymatic treatment to remove the template DNA. This mixture is combined with the linearized `pYEX-DEST` vector and used to transform yeast cells. The transformed cells are then grown on agar plates containing blasticidin.\n\nMany of the resulting colonies are found to contain an unintended plasmid instead of the desired new construct. What is the total size of this unintended circular plasmid, in kbp? Answer with a single real number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the size of an unintended plasmid product resulting from a yeast cloning experiment. We must analyze the components of the transformation mixture and how they behave inside the yeast cell under selection pressure.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the major DNA species present in the mixture used to transform the yeast cells.\n1.  **Linearized `pYEX-DEST` vector**: This is the 4.8 kbp backbone, prepared correctly for recombination.\n2.  **`opt_GFP` amplicon**: This is the intended 1.2 kbp gene fragment, amplified by PCR and equipped with the necessary homology arms for assembly.\n3.  **`pYEX-LEGACY` template plasmid**: The problem states the student uses the raw, unpurified PCR reaction. This means the original template DNA, the circular `pYEX-LEGACY` plasmid, is still present in the mixture.\n\nSecond, let's determine the properties of the `pYEX-LEGACY` plasmid. It is described as having the same 4.8 kbp backbone as `pYEX-DEST` and containing the 1.2 kbp `opt_GFP` gene.\nThe total size of the circular `pYEX-LEGACY` plasmid is the sum of the backbone size and the gene size:\n$$ \\text{Size of } pYEX-LEGACY = \\text{Backbone size} + \\text{Gene size} = 4.8 \\text{ kbp} + 1.2 \\text{ kbp} = 6.0 \\text{ kbp} $$\nCrucially, since it shares the same backbone as `pYEX-DEST`, `pYEX-LEGACY` also carries the blasticidin resistance gene, `BsdR`.\n\nThird, let's consider the possible events inside the yeast cells after transformation and plating on blasticidin media.\n*   **Intended Event (Homologous Recombination):** The yeast cell's DNA repair machinery recognizes the homologous arms on the linear `opt_GFP` amplicon and the ends of the linear `pYEX-DEST` vector. It will stitch these two pieces together to form a new, circular recombinant plasmid. This is the desired product. This plasmid contains the `BsdR` gene and will allow the cell to grow on blasticidin. Its size would also be $4.8 + 1.2 = 6.0$ kbp.\n*   **Unintended Event (Template Contamination):** Yeast cells are also capable of taking up intact, circular plasmids. The `pYEX-LEGACY` template plasmid is present in the transformation mixture. If a yeast cell takes up this plasmid, it acquires a stable, circular DNA molecule that can replicate. Since `pYEX-LEGACY` contains the `BsdR` gene, this cell will be resistant to blasticidin and will form a colony on the selection plate.\n\nThe question asks for the size of the *unintended* plasmid product. This corresponds to the `pYEX-LEGACY` template plasmid that contaminates the assembly reaction. As calculated above, the size of this plasmid is 6.0 kbp. This is a common experimental artifact when the PCR template is not removed (e.g., by DpnI digestion, which selectively degrades the methylated parental plasmid) before transformation. The recovery of the original template plasmid is an unintended, yet frequent, outcome of the described procedure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.0}$$", "id": "2079558"}]}
