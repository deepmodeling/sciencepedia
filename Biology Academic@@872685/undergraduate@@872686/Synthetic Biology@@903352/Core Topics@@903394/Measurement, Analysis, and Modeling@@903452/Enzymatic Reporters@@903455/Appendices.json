This practice focuses on a critical aspect of experimental design: defining a proper negative control. By considering how to measure the strength of a novel promoter using a β-galactosidase reporter, you will learn to distinguish true promoter-driven expression from background signal, ensuring the validity of your quantitative data.", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is working in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast) to characterize the strength of a newly discovered promoter sequence, which they call `P_novel`. To do this, they construct a plasmid containing `P_novel` placed immediately upstream of a `lacZ` reporter gene. The `lacZ` gene encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase. When the team transforms yeast cells with this plasmid, the strength of `P_novel` can be quantified by measuring the enzymatic activity of β-galactosidase.\n\nTo accurately determine the activity originating specifically from `P_novel`, the team must subtract any background or \"leaky\" expression from their measurements. This requires a carefully designed negative control experiment. Which of the following options represents the most appropriate negative control for this specific purpose?\n\nA. Yeast cells transformed with a plasmid containing `P_novel` but lacking the `lacZ` reporter gene.\n\nB. Wild-type yeast cells that have not been transformed with any plasmid.\n\nC.

Yeast cells transformed with a plasmid containing `P_novel` upstream of a different reporter gene, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).", "solution": "Goal: quantify the activity specifically attributable to the promoter $P_{\\text{novel}}$ driving the reporter $lacZ$ by subtracting any background (basal or leaky) reporter expression not caused by $P_{\\text{novel}}$. A proper negative control must keep all elements identical to the test construct except the promoter activity, so that any measured $\\beta$-galactosidase signal reflects background transcription or assay noise rather than promoter-driven expression.\n\nCriteria for the most appropriate negative control:\n- Use the same plasmid backbone and the same reporter gene ($lacZ$) to capture vector-derived basal transcription, cryptic promoters, transcriptional read-through, and assay background inherent to the reporter and plasmid context.\n- Remove the promoter activity specifically, so that any measured signal corresponds to background/leaky expression in the absence of an intentional promoter.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A: Plasmid with $P_{\\text{novel}}$ but no $lacZ$ reporter. This does not report $\\beta$-galactosidase activity from the construct at all; it only captures endogenous or assay background unrelated to the plasmid $lacZ$, and thus cannot quantify reporter-specific basal expression. Not appropriate.\n- B: Wild-type yeast with no plasmid. This measures only cellular or assay background without any contribution from plasmid backbone or $lacZ$ context, so it underestimates background relevant to the actual construct. Not appropriate.\n- C: Strong constitutive promoter (e.g., $P_{\\text{TEF1}}$) upstream of $lacZ$. This is a positive control to validate reporter detection and dynamic range, not a negative control. Not appropriate for background subtraction.\n- D: Plasmid with $lacZ$ but no promoter upstream. This preserves the same vector and reporter context while removing promoter-driven transcription, directly measuring basal/leaky expression from the construct. This is the correct negative control to subtract background specific to the reporter-plasmid system.\n- E: $P_{\\text{novel}}$ driving a different reporter (GFP). Reporter differences alter expression, stability, and detection, making it incomparable for background subtraction of $lacZ$. Not appropriate.\n\nConclusion: The most appropriate negative control is the promoterless $lacZ$ construct in the same plasmid backbone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2036199"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting experimental results, especially when they are unexpected, is a key skill for any scientist. This exercise presents a classic troubleshooting scenario in which a blue-white screen yields a false-negative result.

The student unexpectedly isolates a white colony, which, upon plasmid sequencing, is found to contain the original vector with a functional *lacZα* gene (i.e., no DNA insert). The hypothesis is that a spontaneous mutation occurred in the *lacY* gene, which encodes the lactose permease responsible for transporting X-gal into the cell.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, you model the system using Michaelis-Menten kinetics for both transport and the intracellular enzymatic reaction. At steady state, the rate of X-gal transport into the cell equals the rate of its cleavage by the β-galactosidase enzyme.\n\nThe kinetic parameters for the wild-type (WT) system are:\n-   Lactose Permease (LacY transport): $V_{max, T} = 50.0 \\text{ µM/s}$ and $K_{M, T} = 100 \\text{ µM}$.\n-   β-galactosidase (LacZ reaction): $V_{max, R} = 120 \\text{ µM/s}$ and $K_{M, R} = 250 \\text{ µM}$.\n\nThe suspected mutant lactose permease (LacY*) has an altered binding affinity for X-gal, but its maximum transport rate is unchanged.

This advanced problem challenges you to use a dual-reporter system to mathematically distinguish between different sources of cellular noise. You will derive an expression that isolates the effect of metabolic fluctuations (ATP) from the stochasticity of the gene expression machinery itself, a technique at the heart of modern systems biology.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is investigating the sources of noise in gene expression within a population of engineered *E. coli*. To do this, they construct a plasmid containing two different reporter genes, luciferase (Luc) and β-galactosidase (LacZ), each driven by an identical, constitutively active promoter. The activity of both enzymes, $I_L(t)$ for luciferase and $I_Z(t)$ for LacZ, is measured simultaneously over time in many individual cells.\n\nThe key difference between the reporters lies in their enzymatic assays. The LacZ assay uses a saturating concentration of a chromogenic substrate, meaning its signal $I_Z(t)$ is directly proportional to the concentration of LacZ protein. In contrast, the luciferase reaction requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a co-substrate. Therefore, its light output $I_L(t)$ is proportional to the product of the luciferase protein concentration and the intracellular ATP concentration.\n\nThe biologist makes the following simplifying assumptions based on established literature:\n1.  The expression dynamics of the two reporter genes are identical due to their identical promoters and genetic context.\n2.  The relationship between measured signals and the underlying molecular concentrations can be accurately described by a first-order approximation for small fluctuations.\n3.  Fluctuations in the intracellular ATP concentration are statistically independent of fluctuations in the gene expression machinery (e.g., polymerases, ribosomes).\n4.  The expression of the reporters does not deplete the cellular ATP pool.\n\nFrom the collected time-series data, the following statistical quantities are calculated:\n- The total observed noise in the luciferase signal, defined as $\\eta_{L,obs}^2 = \\frac{\\text{Var}(I_L)}{\\langle I_L \\rangle^2}$.\n- The total observed noise in the LacZ signal, defined as $\\eta_{Z,obs}^2 = \\frac{\\text{Var}(I_Z)}{\\langle I_Z \\rangle^2}$.\n- The observed covariance of the normalized signals, defined as $C_{obs} = \\text{Cov}\\left(\\frac{I_L}{\\langle I_L \\rangle}, \\frac{I_Z}{\\langle I_Z \\rangle}\\right)$.\nHere, $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the time and population average, $\\text{Var}(\\cdot)$ is the variance, and $\\text{Cov}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the covariance.\n\nThe total noise for any expressed protein can be decomposed into an intrinsic component ($\\eta_{int}^2$), arising from the stochastic events of its own transcription and translation, and an extrinsic component ($\\eta_{ext}^2$), arising from fluctuations in shared cellular factors. In this specific system, the extrinsic noise affecting the luciferase signal is a combination of noise from the shared gene expression machinery ($\\eta_{ext,\\xi}^2$) and noise from ATP fluctuations ($\\eta_{ATP}^2$).\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the ratio of the extrinsic noise due to ATP fluctuations to the intrinsic gene expression noise, $\\frac{\\eta_{ATP}^2}{\\eta_{int}^2}$. Your final expression must be solely in terms of the experimentally measured quantities $\\eta_{L,obs}^2$, $\\eta_{Z,obs}^2$, and $C_{obs}$.", "solution": "Let $L(t)$ and $Z(t)$ be the concentrations of the luciferase and LacZ proteins, respectively, and let $A(t)$ be the concentration of ATP.

For any fluctuating quantity $X(t)$, we define its normalized fluctuation as $\\hat{X} = \\frac{X(t) - \\langle X \\rangle}{\\langle X \\rangle}$. The noise, or squared coefficient of variation, is $\\eta_X^2 = \\langle \\hat{X}^2 \\rangle$.\n\nLet's find the normalized fluctuations for the measured signals, $\\hat{I}_L$ and $\\hat{I}_Z$.\nFor the LacZ signal:\n$I_Z = k_Z Z$. The mean is $\\langle I_Z \\rangle = k_Z \\langle Z \\rangle$. The fluctuation is $\\delta I_Z = k_Z \\delta Z$.\nThe normalized fluctuation is $\\hat{I}_Z = \\frac{\\delta I_Z}{\\langle I_Z \\rangle} = \\frac{k_Z \\delta Z}{k_Z \\langle Z \\rangle} = \\hat{Z}$.\n\nFor the luciferase signal:\n$I_L = k_L L A = k_L \\langle L \\rangle(1+\\hat{L}) \\langle A \\rangle(1+\\hat{A})$.\nExpanding this, we get $I_L = k_L \\langle L \\rangle \\langle A \\rangle (1 + \\hat{L} + \\hat{A} + \\hat{L}\\hat{A})$.\nFor small fluctuations, we can neglect the second-order term $\\hat{L}\\hat{A}$.
