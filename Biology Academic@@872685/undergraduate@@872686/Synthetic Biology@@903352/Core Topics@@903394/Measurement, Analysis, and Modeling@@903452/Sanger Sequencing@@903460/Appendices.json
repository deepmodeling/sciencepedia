The reaction is initiated using a 15-nucleotide-long primer. The method involves four separate reaction mixtures. Each mixture contains the DNA template, the primer, DNA polymerase, all four standard deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), and a small amount of one of four chain-terminating dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs: ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, or ddTTP).\n\nAfter the reactions are complete, the resulting DNA fragments are separated by size, and their lengths are measured.

The fluorescence signal at a given read position in the chromatogram is the superposition of contributions from all fragments that terminate at that length, resolved into four color channels corresponding to the four bases. When two templates share the same primer site and are present at equal molar amounts, DNA polymerase will extend primers on both templates without preference, producing two fragment populations that co-migrate by length but differ in dye color at positions where the templates have different bases.\n\nLet the base at position $n$ (counting from the first nucleotide after the primer) on Template X be $b_{X}(n)$ and on Template Y be $b_{Y}(n)$. At each position $n$:\n- If $b_{X}(n) \\neq b_{Y}(n)$, the fragments of length corresponding to position $n$ will contain two subpopulations terminated with different ddNTPs, one for $b_{X}(n)$ and one for $b_{Y}(n)$. The chromatogram will thus show two distinct peaks in two different color channels at the same read position, each with approximately half the intensity of a single-template signal (due to the equimolar split of molecules).\n- If $b_{X}(n) = b_{Y}(n)$, the fragments will terminate with the same ddNTP, yielding a single peak with intensity approximately equal to the sum of both contributions (near normal to slightly increased relative to a single-template case, depending on overall loading and normalization).\n\nUsing the provided sequences immediately after the primer, Template X is ATGCGTGCTAGA... and Template Y is TACGACGTTCAG....

This practice challenges you to diagnose a sequencing run that produces a clean signal before suddenly disappearing. Understanding how the physical properties of a DNA template, such as the formation of a stable hairpin loop, can physically obstruct DNA polymerase is crucial for successfully sequencing difficult or complex synthetic constructs. [@problem_id:2066454]", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is validating a custom-synthesized DNA fragment. The fragment is cloned into a plasmid, and Sanger sequencing is performed using a primer that binds upstream of the insert. The sequencing reaction uses a standard thermostable DNA polymerase, deoxynucleynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and fluorescently labeled, chain-terminating dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs).\n\nThe analysis of the sequencing results reveals a clean, high-quality chromatogram with strong signal intensity for approximately 95 bases. However, immediately following this position, the signal intensity drops to nearly zero, and the sequence becomes completely unreadable.\n\nThe expected (designed) sequence of the single-stranded template DNA in this region is as follows (showing bases 70 through 130):\n\n5'-...TGACGAAGTC **CCTAGGGTAC GACTAGTC** ATAG **GACTAGTC GTACCCTAGG** ATCGATGC...-3'\n(The region from base 90 to 121 is shown in bold).\n\nGiven this observation and the known sequence, what is the most plausible explanation for the sudden failure of the sequencing reaction?\n\nA. The single-stranded DNA template formed a highly stable secondary structure (a hairpin loop) around base 95, which physically obstructed the DNA polymerase.\n\nB. The sequencing primer had a secondary binding site on the template DNA near base 95, leading to conflicting signals and reaction termination.\n\nC. The concentration of ddNTPs in the reaction mixture was too low, causing them to be entirely consumed before the polymerase reached base 95.\n\nD. A large deletion of approximately 30 base pairs occurred in the template DNA starting at position 96, and thus no template was available to be sequenced beyond this point.\n\nE. The plasmid DNA used as a template was not fully linearized, causing the polymerase to stall on supercoiled regions of the DNA.", "solution": "We analyze the Sanger sequencing setup: a thermostable DNA polymerase extends from a primer on a single-stranded template in the presence of dNTPs and fluorescent ddNTPs; chain termination occurs upon ddNTP incorporation, producing a population of fragments whose lengths give a chromatogram. A clean, high-quality trace for approximately 95 bases followed by an abrupt collapse to near-zero intensity indicates that extension is proceeding normally up to a specific position where most polymerase molecules can no longer extend, consistent with a site-specific physical or structural block on the template rather than a global reagent issue.\n\nWe inspect the provided template sequence (bases 70 to 130), with bases 90 to 121 emphasized. The emphasized region is presented as two bold blocks flanking a short non-bold spacer:\n- Left bold: CCTAGGGTAC GACTAGTC\n- Spacer: ATAG\n- Right bold: GACTAGTC GTACCCTAGG\n\nTwo key features are evident:\n1) The sequence GACTAGTC is a perfect palindrome: its reverse complement is itself. This enables internal pairing and stabilizes hairpin stems.\n2) The sequence CCTAGGGTAC on the left has its reverse complement GTACCCTAGG on the right. Thus, the emphasized region contains a near-perfect inverted repeat flanking a short spacer. Such inverted repeats in single-stranded DNA readily form a stable hairpin structure, with the complementary arms base-pairing to form a stem and the short spacer forming the loop.\n\nDuring cycle sequencing, after primer annealing, the single-stranded template can adopt such secondary structure at the annealing/extension temperature. A highly stable hairpin stem enriched in G-C pairs (e.g., CCTAGGGTAC pairing with GTACCCTAGG, and the palindromic GACTAGTC segments) can obstruct progression of the DNA polymerase, causing stalling and failure of further extension. This produces an abrupt loss of readable signal starting where the hairpin forms, matching the observation of a clean signal up to about base 95 and then a collapse.\n\nWe now evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. Hairpin obstruction at approximately base 95. The provided sequence shows strong inverted repeats and palindromic elements that can form a stable hairpin around the indicated region. This directly explains a site-specific, abrupt failure of extension. This is consistent with the data.\n\nB. Secondary primer binding near base 95 would yield mixed priming products from cycle 1, typically producing overlapping peaks and a messy chromatogram from the outset rather than a clean trace that abruptly drops to zero at a specific position. This conflicts with the observed clean early signal.\n\nC. Low ddNTP concentration or consumption would not cause termination at a specific position; it would alter the termination distribution globally. If ddNTPs are too low, reads tend to be longer, not shorter, and the signal would not abruptly vanish at the same base across molecules.\n\nD. A deletion starting at position 96 would not eliminate available template beyond that point, because the plasmid contains vector sequence downstream; sequencing would continue into vector backbone. A deletion does not cause complete absence of template for extension across all molecules at one position.\n\nE. Supercoiling of plasmid is standard for Sanger templates, and polymerase does not stall at a specific base due to supercoiling under denaturation/annealing conditions. Moreover, supercoiling would not produce a sharp site-specific drop in signal.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is the formation of a stable hairpin in the single-stranded template that blocks polymerase progression in the highlighted inverted-repeat region, corresponding to choice A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2066454"}]}
