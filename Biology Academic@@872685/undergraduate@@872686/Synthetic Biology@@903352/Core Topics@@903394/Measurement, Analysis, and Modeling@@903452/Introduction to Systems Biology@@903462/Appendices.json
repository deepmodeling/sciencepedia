The biologist assumes a simple model for the concentration of the reporter protein, $P(t)$, following the induction of gene expression at time $t=0$. The model is described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \\alpha - \\gamma P(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the constant rate of protein synthesis (in units of concentration per unit time) and $\\gamma$ is the first-order rate constant for protein degradation and dilution (in units of inverse time). The initial protein concentration is zero, i.e., $P(0) = 0$.\n\nThe experimental measurement, however, does not yield the absolute protein concentration $P(t)$. Instead, a fluorescence plate reader measures the fluorescence intensity $F(t)$, which is proportional to the protein concentration.

This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{\\alpha - \\gamma P} = dt\n$$\nNow, we integrate both sides from the initial state $(t=0, P=0)$ to a later state $(t, P(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{P(t)} \\frac{dP'}{\\alpha - \\gamma P'} = \\int_{0}^{t} dt'\n$$\nThe left-hand side integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln(\\alpha - \\gamma P') \\right]_{0}^{P(t)} = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( \\ln(\\alpha - \\gamma P(t)) - \\ln(\\alpha - \\gamma \\cdot 0) \\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha - \\gamma P(t)}{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\nThe right-hand side integral is simply $t$.

The characteristic time constant of the exponential approach to steady state, $\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}$.\n\nThe biologist measures fluorescence, $F(t)$, which is related to $P(t)$ by an unknown scaling factor $c$:\n$$\nF(t) = c \\cdot P(t) = c \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t))\n$$\nThe experimentalist fits their time-course data to a functional form, which we can write as:\n$$\nF(t) = F_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-k t))\n$$\nwhere $F_{ss}$ is the measured steady-state fluorescence and $k$ is the observed rate constant of the fluorescence increase.\n\nBy comparing the theoretical form of $F(t)$ with the function fitted to the data, we can relate the fitted parameters ($F_{ss}$ and $k$) to the underlying physical parameters ($\\alpha$, $\\gamma$) and the unknown constant ($c$).\nFrom the exponential term, we can see that the observed rate constant $k$ is identical to the physical degradation rate constant $\\gamma$:\n$$\nk = \\gamma\n$$\nThus, by determining the time constant of the fluorescence curve (which is $1/k$), the biologist can uniquely determine the value of $\\gamma$. The temporal dynamics of the system are not affected by the constant scaling factor $c$.\n\nNow let's consider the amplitude of the signal. The measured steady-state fluorescence $F_{ss}$ is:\n$$\nF_{ss} = c \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma}\n$$\nThe biologist has a numerical value for $F_{ss}$ from the data fit, and they have just determined $\\gamma$ from the time constant of the fit ($k$). The equation becomes:\n$$\nF_{ss} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\alpha}{\\gamma}\n$$\nIn this equation, $F_{ss}$ and $\\gamma$ are known quantities, but both $\\alpha$ and $c$ are unknown. This gives a single equation with two unknowns. It is impossible to solve for $\\alpha$ uniquely without knowing the value of the arbitrary scaling constant $c$. We can only determine the value of the product $c \\cdot \\alpha$:\n$$\nc \\cdot \\alpha = F_{ss} \\cdot \\gamma\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ cannot be separated from $c$, it cannot be uniquely determined from this experiment alone.\n\nTherefore, the degradation rate constant $\\gamma$ can be uniquely determined from the time dynamics of the fluorescence signal, but the synthesis rate $\\alpha$ cannot be determined because it is convolved with the unknown instrumental scaling factor $c$.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that statement B is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2046190"}, {"introduction": "The true power of systems biology lies in understanding and engineering emergent properties that arise from the interaction of simple components.
