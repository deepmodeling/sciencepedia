To quantify the success of the engineering, the researcher performs an analysis using flow cytometry, a technique that measures light scattering and fluorescence properties of individual particles suspended in a fluid stream.\n\nThe instrument records data for a total of $N_{total} = 500,000$ events, which includes single cells, cell aggregates (clumps), and cellular debris. The analysis is performed using a hierarchical gating strategy as follows:\n\n1.  **Gate P1 (Single, Viable Cells):** A primary gate, designated P1, is defined on a plot of Forward Scatter (FSC) versus Side Scatter (SSC). FSC is correlated with particle size, and SSC is correlated with internal complexity. This gate is drawn to exclude events corresponding to debris (low FSC/SSC) and cell aggregates (high FSC/SSC), thereby isolating the population of single, viable cells. The analysis shows that $N_{P1} = 385,000$ events from the total population fall within this gate.\n\n2.  **Gate P2 (GFP-Positive Cells):** A secondary gate, designated P2, is applied exclusively to the population of events that passed through Gate P1. This gate is defined based on a fluorescence intensity histogram to identify cells that exhibit a GFP signal significantly above the autofluorescence background of control cells. The analysis finds that $N_{P2} = 296,450$ of the cells from Gate P1 also meet the criteria for Gate P2.\n\nBased on this gating strategy, what fraction of the viable, single-cell population is successfully expressing GFP?
