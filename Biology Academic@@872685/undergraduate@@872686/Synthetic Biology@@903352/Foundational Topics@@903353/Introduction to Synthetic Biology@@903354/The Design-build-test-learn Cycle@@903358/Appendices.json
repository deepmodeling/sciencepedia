[@problem_id:2074894]", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is in the \"Build\" phase of a Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle. The goal is to construct a bacterial biosensor. The design involves inserting a gene for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which will act as a reporter, into a commercially available plasmid vector named `pEXPR`. The `pEXPR` vector contains a gene `bla` that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin.\n\nThe experimental plan is as follows:\n1.  The `pEXPR` vector backbone is digested with two different restriction enzymes, EcoRI and BamHI, to create a linear piece of DNA with incompatible \"sticky ends\". This strategy is intended to prevent the vector from ligating back to itself.\n2.  The GFP gene is amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using primers that add an EcoRI site to one end and a BamHI site to the other end. This amplified DNA is called the \"insert\".\n3.  The insert is also digested with EcoRI and BamHI.\n4.  The digested vector and insert are mixed together with T4 DNA ligase to create the final circular plasmid.\n5.  The resulting ligation mixture is transformed into a strain of competent *E. coli* cells.\n6.  The cells are plated on a petri dish containing Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar and ampicillin for selection.\n\nThe student also prepares two controls: a \"positive control\" where un-digested `pEXPR` plasmid is transformed and plated on an identical LB-ampicillin plate, and a \"negative control\" where competent cells with no added DNA are plated on another identical LB-ampicillin plate.\n\nAfter overnight incubation, the negative control plate has no colonies, and the positive control plate is covered in colonies, confirming the cells, the plasmid stock, and the selective plates are all functional. However, the experimental plate with the ligation mixture shows zero colonies.\n\nGiven these results, which of the following represents the most direct and likely cause for the complete failure to obtain colonies in the main experiment?\n\nA. The GFP gene insert was accidentally ligated into the vector in the reverse orientation.\nB. The heat shock step of the transformation protocol was performed at 37 °C instead of the optimal 42 °C.\nC. The T4 DNA ligase enzyme was inadvertently omitted from the ligation reaction mixture.\nD. The promoter sequence upstream of the GFP insertion site is specific to eukaryotes and is not recognized by *E. coli* RNA polymerase.\nE. A mutation occurred during the PCR amplification of the GFP insert, creating a premature stop codon.", "solution": "We analyze the selection logic and the controls to identify the most direct cause of zero colonies in the experimental plate.\n\nFirst, on LB with ampicillin, only cells that acquire a circular plasmid carrying a functional ampicillin resistance gene (bla) will form colonies. Linear DNA is rapidly degraded in bacteria and does not replicate; hence, it does not confer stable ampicillin resistance.\n\nThe negative control (no DNA) yielding no colonies confirms that the antibiotic selection is effective and there is no contamination. The positive control (undigested pEXPR plasmid) yielding many colonies confirms that the competent cells, transformation workflow, recovery, and plates are functional.\n\nIn the main experiment, the vector was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, producing incompatible sticky ends to prevent self-ligation. The insert was PCR-amplified and digested with the same enzymes to produce matching ends for directional cloning. Successful colony formation therefore requires ligation to re-circularize the vector with the insert.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Reverse orientation of the insert would still produce a circular plasmid carrying bla. Even if GFP were nonfunctional or improperly expressed, the bla gene on the vector would confer ampicillin resistance, so colonies would still be expected. This cannot explain zero colonies.\n\nB. Performing heat shock at a suboptimal temperature could reduce transformation efficiency. However, the positive control produced many colonies under the same transformation pipeline, indicating that the transformation step was functional. Moreover, a suboptimal heat shock temperature would typically decrease, not abolish, transformants; complete absence of colonies is less directly explained than by a failed ligation.\n\nC. Omitting T4 DNA ligase prevents ligation of the EcoRI- and BamHI-digested vector to the similarly digested insert. Given that the vector ends are incompatible with each other, the vector cannot self-ligate without ligase; the reaction remains as linear DNA fragments. Linear DNA does not confer stable ampicillin resistance and is not maintained in Escherichia coli, so no colonies would be expected. This directly matches the observation and is fully consistent with functional controls.\n\nD. A eukaryotic promoter upstream of GFP would prevent GFP expression in Escherichia coli but does not affect the bla gene; colonies would still form, albeit non-fluorescent. This does not explain zero colonies.\n\nE. A premature stop codon in GFP affects only GFP expression, not bla. Colonies would still form. This does not explain zero colonies.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and likely cause of complete failure to obtain colonies in the main experiment is omission of T4 DNA ligase from the ligation reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2074894"}, {"introduction": "Once a genetic construct is successfully built, its performance must be tested in a living system. This exercise explores a crucial concept that often emerges during the 'Test' and 'Learn' phases: the context-dependency of biological parts. By examining why a genetic circuit functions correctly in one host strain but fails in another, you will learn to appreciate that parts are not always perfectly modular and that the cellular environment, or \"chassis,\" can dramatically alter a system's behavior. [@problem_id:1428108]", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is following the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle to create a simple genetic switch. Their \"Design\" is a plasmid intended to function as an inducible expression system. The plasmid contains two key components:\n1. A gene expressing the LacI repressor protein, driven by a weak, constitutive promoter.\n2. A gene for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), driven by a strong, LacI-repressible promoter (`P_lac`).\n\nThe team \"Builds\" this plasmid and \"Tests\" it in two different strains of *E. coli*.\n- **Test 1:** In the cloning strain *E. coli* DH5α, the circuit works perfectly. The cells show very low fluorescence in the absence of an inducer and high fluorescence when the inducer is added.\n- **Test 2:** The exact same plasmid is moved to the protein expression strain *E. coli* BL21(DE3). In this strain, the circuit fails. The cells exhibit high GFP fluorescence even in the complete absence of any inducer.\n\nNow in the \"Learn\" phase, the team must form a hypothesis to explain this context-dependent failure. Based on the known general characteristics of cloning strains versus protein expression strains, which one of the following hypotheses is the most plausible explanation for the high basal (leaky) expression observed in BL21(DE3)?\n\nA. The GFP protein is folded into its active, fluorescent conformation much more efficiently in the cytoplasm of BL21(DE3) than in DH5α, leading to a higher fluorescent signal for the same amount of protein.\nB. The plasmid's origin of replication leads to a significantly higher plasmid copy number per cell in the BL21(DE3) host environment compared to the DH5α host.\nC. The BL21(DE3) strain has a much higher concentration of endogenous proteases that specifically degrade the LacI repressor, reducing its ability to bind to the `P_lac` promoter.\nD. The ribosomes in BL21(DE3) translate the `gfp` mRNA sequence at a significantly faster rate than the ribosomes in DH5α, leading to a rapid accumulation of GFP.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the regulatory logic of the circuit. The LacI repressor is produced from a weak constitutive promoter, and the GFP reporter is driven by a strong $P_{\\text{lac}}$ promoter repressed by LacI. In the absence of inducer, repression succeeds if the cellular concentration of active LacI tetramers is sufficiently high relative to the number of $P_{\\text{lac}}$ operator sites and the promoter’s intrinsic strength. When moved across hosts, any factor that decreases the effective LacI repression or increases the effective transcriptional drive of $P_{\\text{lac}}$ can manifest as high basal fluorescence.\n\nWe now evaluate each hypothesis against known, general properties of cloning strains (e.g., DH5α) and protein expression strains (e.g., BL21(DE3)) and against the mechanistic requirements for LacI repression.\n\n- Hypothesis A (improved folding in BL21(DE3)): Enhanced folding efficiency would scale the fluorescence signal per GFP molecule by a multiplicative factor $f$ without altering the transcriptional state of $P_{\\text{lac}}$. This affects readout sensitivity but does not convert a tightly repressed promoter into a transcriptionally derepressed state. High basal fluorescence attributable purely to folding would imply that the same low basal expression in DH5α is simply less detectable, yet the observation is a qualitative failure of repression in BL21(DE3). This is therefore not the most plausible cause of leaky transcription.\n\n- Hypothesis B (higher plasmid copy number in BL21(DE3)): Let $N$ denote the plasmid copy number. The number of operator sites scales as $N$. The total LacI produced from a weak promoter also scales with $N$, but because the LacI promoter is weak and $P_{\\text{lac}}$ is strong, effective repression requires a substantial excess of active repressor over the number of available operator sites, factoring in binding stoichiometry, nonspecific binding, and stochastic fluctuations. In practice, high copy numbers can titrate repressors, and tight control of lac-based promoters often necessitates elevated LacI expression (e.g., lacI^{q}) to overcome operator titration. Host-dependent differences in the control of ColE1-like origins can alter $N$, and expression hosts can yield different $N$ than cloning strains. Thus, an increased $N$ in BL21(DE3) is a plausible general mechanism to increase basal expression by outstripping the weak LacI supply relative to the strong $P_{\\text{lac}}$, thereby causing leak.\n\n- Hypothesis C (higher protease levels degrading LacI in BL21(DE3)): A defining feature of BL21(DE3) is that it is protease-deficient (notably lon^{-}, ompT^{-}), which reduces proteolysis of recombinant proteins. The claim of “much higher concentration of endogenous proteases that specifically degrade LacI” contradicts this general property. This hypothesis is not plausible.\n\n- Hypothesis D (faster translation in BL21(DE3)): There is no general property that BL21(DE3) ribosomes translate mRNA “significantly faster” than DH5α ribosomes across arbitrary genes. Moreover, any global increase in translation rate would affect both LacI and GFP, and would not selectively abolish repression. This is not a compelling or general explanation for leaky transcription.\n\nAmong the options, the mechanism that aligns with a known and commonly encountered failure mode in lac-repressed circuits—operator titration due to increased gene dosage—is Hypothesis B. It explains why a weakly expressed LacI (from a weak constitutive promoter) can be sufficient in DH5α yet fail in BL21(DE3) if the host context increases plasmid copy number and thus the number of strong $P_{\\text{lac}}$ promoters to repress. It also fits the broader principle that host-dependent replication control can modulate copy number and thereby repressor demand.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1428108"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond individual parts, synthetic biology aims to engineer entire systems with predictable, dynamic behaviors. This practice challenges you to think at the level of a genetic circuit, a simple network of interacting components.

These repressors function to mutually inhibit each other's expression.\n\nThe architecture is as follows:\n- Repressor X binds to the operator site of `promoter_Y`, preventing the transcription of `gene_Y`.\n- Repressor Y binds to the operator site of `promoter_X`, preventing the transcription of `gene_X`.\n\nTo monitor the circuit's state, a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter gene is placed under the control of `promoter_Y`, such that its expression is coupled with that of `gene_Y`. The \"ON\" state is defined by high GFP fluorescence (high Repressor Y), and the \"OFF\" state is defined by low GFP fluorescence (low Repressor Y, high Repressor X).\n\nDuring the 'Test' phase, the student observes that the bacterial culture is always bright green, indicating the circuit is permanently stuck in the \"ON\" state. Even after applying a chemical inducer that transiently forces the expression of `gene_X` to attempt to flip the switch \"OFF,\" the system rapidly returns to the high-GFP \"ON\" state as soon as the inducer is washed out.\n\nEntering the 'Learn' phase, the student must propose a single change to the genetic design for the next 'Design' phase.

The genetic toggle switch with mutual repression can be modeled by Hill-type repression kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt}=\\frac{\\beta_{X}}{1+\\left(\\frac{Y}{K_{YX}}\\right)^{n_{YX}}}-\\delta_{X}X,\n\\qquad\n\\frac{dY}{dt}=\\frac{\\beta_{Y}}{1+\\left(\\frac{X}{K_{XY}}\\right)^{n_{XY}}}-\\delta_{Y}Y,\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_{X}$ and $\\beta_{Y}$ are the maximal production rates, $\\delta_{X}$ and $\\delta_{Y}$ are the effective first-order degradation or dilution rates, $K_{YX}$ is the effective dissociation constant for Repressor Y binding to promoter_X, $K_{XY}$ is the effective dissociation constant for Repressor X binding to promoter_Y, and $n_{YX},n_{XY}$ are Hill coefficients. GFP is coexpressed with $Y$, so high GFP corresponds to high $Y$.\n\nSteady states satisfy the nullcline equations\n$$\nX=\\frac{\\beta_{X}}{\\delta_{X}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{Y}{K_{YX}}\\right)^{n_{YX}}}\\equiv f(Y),\n\\qquad\nY=\\frac{\\beta_{Y}}{\\delta_{Y}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{X}{K_{XY}}\\right)^{n_{XY}}}\\equiv g(X).\n$$\nBistability requires three intersections of the nullclines $(X,Y)$, with the middle one unstable and the outer two stable. This typically occurs when repression is sufficiently strong and cooperative (large $n_{XY}$, $n_{YX}$) and the system is balanced so that both $f(Y)$ and $g(X)$ are sufficiently steep and intersect in the appropriate S-shaped region.\n\nThe observation that the culture is always bright green (high $Y$) and that transient induction of $X$ fails to flip the switch indicates monostability biased toward high $Y$ and low $X$. In terms of the equations, for typical parameter values the $X$-nullcline $X=f(Y)$ lies too low relative to the $Y$-nullcline $Y=g(X)$, resulting in a single intersection at high $Y$. One sufficient cause is overly strong repression of promoter_X by Repressor Y, i.e., a small $K_{YX}$ and/or large $n_{YX}$ compared to the opposing arm, so that even transiently increased $X$ cannot maintain repression of $Y$ once the inducer is removed.\n\nTo restore bistability by a single design change, we should reduce the dominance of the $Y\\rightarrow X$ repression arm. Weakening the binding affinity of Repressor Y to promoter_X corresponds to increasing $K_{YX}$, which raises $f(Y)$ for each fixed $Y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial K_{YX}}>0 \\quad \\text{for fixed } Y>0,\n$$\nthereby shifting the $X$-nullcline upward. This increases $X$ at steady state for a given $Y$, promoting additional intersections of the nullclines and enabling a stable low-$Y$/high-$X$ state. This adjustment directly counters the observed lock-in of the high-$Y$ state and is the minimal change consistent with restoring symmetry and bistability.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (weaken Y binding to promoter_X) increases $K_{YX}$, reduces repression of $X$ by $Y$, shifts $f(Y)$ upward, and is expected to promote bistability.\n- B (increase degradation of X) increases $\\delta_{X}$, lowers $f(Y)$, further suppresses $X$, and worsens the lock-in.\n- C (increase translation of Y) increases $\\beta_{Y}$, raises $g(X)$, further favoring high $Y$, and worsens the lock-in.\n- D (strengthen Y binding) decreases $K_{YX}$, further suppresses $X$, and worsens the lock-in.\n- E (constitutive promoter_X) removes mutual repression on one arm, eliminating the necessary positive feedback for bistability.\n\nTherefore, the modification most likely to fix the circuit by promoting true bistability is to weaken the binding affinity of Repressor Y for promoter_X.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2074926"}]}
