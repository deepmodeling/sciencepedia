Glucose is converted through a series of reactions into a central metabolic precursor, which we will call **Precursor-M**.\n2.  **Precursor-M** serves as the starting point for three distinct pathways:\n    *   **Pathway 1**: Catalyzed by enzyme E1, **Precursor-M** is converted to **Intermediate-X**. **Intermediate-X** is then converted into **Essential Biomolecule A**.\n    *   **Pathway 2**: Catalyzed by enzyme E2, **Precursor-M** is converted to **Intermediate-Y**. **Intermediate-Y** is then converted into **Essential Biomolecule B**.\n    *   **Pathway 3**: Catalyzed by enzyme E3, **Precursor-M** is converted to **Intermediate-Z**, which is the direct precursor to the desired product, Synthecin-V.\n3.
