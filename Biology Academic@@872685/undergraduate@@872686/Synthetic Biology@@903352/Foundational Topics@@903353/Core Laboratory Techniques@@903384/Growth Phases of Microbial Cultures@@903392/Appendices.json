The first strain, Strain WT, is the wild-type, which is a prototroph capable of synthesizing all necessary amino acids from basic precursors. The second strain, Strain AUX, has been genetically engineered to have a non-functional *trpC* gene, rendering it an auxotroph for the amino acid tryptophan.\n\nBoth strains are inoculated at an identical low initial cell density into separate flasks. Each flask contains the same volume of a sterile minimal medium. This medium consists of a glucose carbon source, ammonium salts as a nitrogen source, and essential minerals, but it is explicitly formulated to be free of all amino acids. Both cultures are then incubated for 24 hours under conditions optimal for *E. coli* growth (e.g., 37°C with aeration).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected state of the cultures for Strain WT and Strain AUX after the 24-hour incubation period?\n\nA.

The medium is a defined minimal medium supplying a carbon source (glucose), a nitrogen source (ammonium), and essential minerals, and it is explicitly free of all amino acids. Strain WT is a prototroph that can synthesize all amino acids from basic precursors; Strain AUX carries a non-functional *trpC* gene and is auxotrophic for tryptophan.\n\nWe apply microbial growth principles. For growth and cell division, cells must synthesize proteins, which requires all essential amino acids, including tryptophan. In minimal medium, prototrophs synthesize amino acids de novo from central metabolic intermediates derived from glucose and ammonium. Auxotrophs that cannot synthesize a required amino acid will not grow unless that amino acid (or an appropriate pathway intermediate beyond the blocked step) is supplied exogenously.\n\nFor Strain WT: As a prototroph, it can synthesize tryptophan and all other amino acids from glucose and ammonium via the shikimate pathway and downstream steps leading to tryptophan, as well as other biosynthetic pathways. Under optimal conditions and sufficient time (24 hours), WT will proceed through lag phase, exponential growth, and, upon depletion of a limiting nutrient or accumulation of waste products, enter stationary phase. Therefore, a high cell density and stationary phase are expected.\n\nFor Strain AUX: The non-functional *trpC* gene interrupts the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, preventing de novo tryptophan synthesis. Because the medium contains no amino acids, there is no external tryptophan source. Without tryptophan, protein synthesis cannot proceed at rates sufficient for growth and cell division, so the culture will not exhibit a significant increase in cell density. Any transient growth due to intracellular reserves would be negligible in this context, and standard expectation is no significant increase compared to the initial inoculum.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because AUX cannot grow without tryptophan in the medium.\n- B is correct: WT reaches high density and stationary phase; AUX shows no significant increase.\n- C is incorrect because AUX cannot outgrow WT in minimal medium lacking tryptophan.\n- D is incorrect because AUX will not undergo even a normal exponential phase without its required amino acid present.\n- E is incorrect because the minimal medium is sufficient for WT growth.\n\nThus the most accurate statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2041472"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply enabling growth, synthetic biologists often aim to optimize it for maximal productivity. This problem moves from qualitative understanding to quantitative modeling by introducing a substrate inhibition model, a scenario where a nutrient can become inhibitory at high concentrations. You will use calculus to determine the optimal substrate concentration, $S_{opt}$, that maximizes the specific growth rate, a common task in bioprocess design [@problem_id:2041435].", "problem": "A synthetic biology research group is optimizing a microbial chassis for the production of a high-value therapeutic protein. The production rate of this protein is found to be directly proportional to the specific growth rate, $\\mu$, of the engineered cells. The cells utilize a specialized, expensive carbon source with concentration $S$. At low concentrations, this substrate is limiting, but at high concentrations, it becomes inhibitory to cellular metabolism. The researchers have characterized this behavior and found that the specific growth rate follows a substrate inhibition model given by the equation:\n\n$$ \\mu(S) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\max} S}{K_s + S + \\frac{S^{2}}{K_i}} $$\n\nHere, $\\mu_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible specific growth rate, $K_s$ is the half-saturation constant, and $K_i$ is the inhibition constant.

This problem presents a thought experiment common in synthetic biology, where an engineered function alters a microbe's physical form—in this case, causing filamentation. By comparing optical density (OD) and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, you will learn to critically evaluate growth data and understand the limitations of each measurement method [@problem_id:2041443].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a strain of *Escherichia coli* is engineered with a faulty temperature-sensitive circuit. At the permissive temperature, the bacteria grow and divide normally. However, when the culture temperature is shifted to a mildly stressful non-permissive temperature, the circuit incorrectly activates, leading to the strong inhibition of a key cell division protein. This inhibition does not affect the rates of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication or overall biomass synthesis. Consequently, as the cells continue to grow without dividing, they form long, non-septated filaments.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where two batch cultures, one with this engineered strain and one with a wild-type (non-engineered) strain, are grown under identical conditions. Both are initially grown at the permissive temperature. As the cultures approach the end of their exponential growth phase due to nutrient limitation, the temperature for both is shifted to the non-permissive temperature, inducing filamentation in the engineered strain.\n\nThe growth of both cultures is monitored using two standard techniques:\n1.  **Optical Density (OD):** A spectrophotometric measurement at 600 nm that quantifies the turbidity of the culture, which is generally proportional to the total cell biomass.\n2.  **Colony Forming Units (CFU) per milliliter:** A method where dilutions of the culture are spread on nutrient agar plates. After incubation, the number of visible colonies is counted to determine the concentration of viable, reproducing cellular units in the original culture.\n\nAssuming the filamentation effect is pronounced in the engineered strain as it enters the stationary phase, which of the following statements best describes the expected discrepancy between the OD and CFU measurements for the engineered culture compared to the wild-type culture?\n\nA. Both OD and CFU measurements for the engineered strain will plateau at significantly lower values than the wild-type, as filamentation is a sign of terminal cell stress and impending culture death.\n\nB. The OD and CFU measurements for the engineered strain will remain tightly correlated and will track closely with the wild-type measurements, as the total biomass increase is the same in both cultures.\n\nC. The OD reading of the engineered culture will continue to increase to a level comparable with the wild-type, while its CFU count will plateau prematurely or even decrease, leading to a large overestimation of viable cell numbers if one were to rely on the OD measurement alone.\n\nD. The CFU count of the engineered culture will continue to increase in a manner comparable to the wild-type culture, while its OD reading will plateau prematurely because the long filaments are less efficient at scattering light than an equivalent mass of individual cells.\n\nE. The OD will plateau as expected, but the CFU count for the engineered culture will appear to increase dramatically, as the fragile filaments shatter into many viable fragments during the plating procedure.", "solution": "Define the two readouts in terms of the underlying biological quantities. Let $B(t)$ denote the total biomass in the culture, $n(t)$ the number of discrete viable reproductive units (i.e., the number of colony-forming units), and $m(t)$ the average biomass per such unit. The optical density is proportional to total biomass:\n$$\n\\mathrm{OD}(t) = k\\,B(t),\n$$\nwith $k0$ a proportionality constant determined by the instrument and path length. Total biomass can be decomposed as\n$$\nB(t) = n(t)\\,m(t).\n$$\nThe CFU readout is proportional to $n(t)$ because each discrete viable unit forms one colony upon plating:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CFU}(t) \\propto n(t).\n$$\n\nIn the wild-type culture during balanced exponential growth prior to nutrient limitation, both biomass synthesis and cell division proceed, so $m(t)$ remains approximately constant while $n(t)$ increases; hence $B(t)$ increases and $\\mathrm{OD}(t)$ and $\\mathrm{CFU}(t)$ rise together. As nutrients become limiting and the culture enters stationary phase, both biomass accumulation and cell division cease, so $B(t)$ and $n(t)$ plateau, causing both $\\mathrm{OD}(t)$ and $\\mathrm{CFU}(t)$ to plateau in a correlated manner.\n\nIn the engineered culture, after the shift to the non-permissive temperature, the division protein is inhibited but DNA replication and biomass synthesis continue. This implies that after the shift, $\\frac{dn}{dt} \\approx 0$ (no production of new discrete units due to division block), while $\\frac{dm}{dt} > 0$ (continued biomass synthesis within non-septated filaments).\nTherefore, the rate of change of total biomass is $\\frac{dB}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(nm) = n \\frac{dm}{dt} + m \\frac{dn}{dt} \\approx n \\frac{dm}{dt} > 0$, so $B(t)$ continues to increase even though $n(t)$ does not. Consequently, $\\frac{d\\,\\mathrm{OD}}{dt} = k \\frac{dB}{dt} > 0$, and the OD continues to rise toward a level comparable to the wild-type culture under the same nutrient constraints, because the total biomass accumulation is not curtailed by the division block. In contrast,\n$$\n\\mathrm{CFU}(t) \\propto n(t)\n$$\nplateaus prematurely when division stops, and can even decrease if mild stress reduces viability over time in stationary phase. Additionally, each long, non-septated filament typically yields a single colony rather than many, further preventing CFU from tracking the increasing biomass. Thus, relying on OD alone would substantially overestimate the number of viable, reproducing units in the engineered culture relative to wild-type.\n\nThis behavior rules out the alternatives that posit tight OD–CFU correlation, premature OD plateau due to scattering changes, or dramatic CFU inflation from filament breakage. The scenario described matches the statement that OD continues to increase while CFU plateaus or decreases, producing a large discrepancy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2041443"}]}
