This practice introduces a classic thought experiment: how can a single enzymatic reaction distinguish between a circular and a linear DNA molecule? Mastering this simple logic is the first step in interpreting any restriction digest.

The student is uncertain about the molecule's topology; it could either be a circular piece of DNA (like a plasmid) or a linear fragment.\n\nTo determine its structure, the student performs a restriction digest experiment. They use a specific restriction enzyme that is known to have exactly one recognition site on this particular 6 kb DNA sequence. After the enzyme reaction, the resulting DNA is analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, a method that separates DNA fragments based on their size.\n\nWhich of the following potential outcomes of the gel electrophoresis analysis of the **digested sample** would allow the student to definitively conclude that the original, undigested DNA molecule was **circular**?\n\nA.

The restriction enzyme is known to have exactly one recognition site on this DNA sequence.\n\nPrinciple: A restriction endonuclease cleaves both strands at each recognition site present. The outcome of a single-site cut depends on the DNA topology:\n- If the DNA is circular with one site, one cut converts it into a single linear fragment of length exactly $L$.\n- If the DNA is linear with one site, one cut produces two linear fragments whose sizes sum to $L$.\n\nPredicted gel outcomes for the digested sample:\n1. Circular DNA with one site $\\Rightarrow$ one band at size $L$.\n2. Linear DNA with one site $\\Rightarrow$ two bands with sizes $x$ and $L-x$, where $0<x<L$, so they sum to $L$.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A. A single band at $6\\,\\text{kb}$ matches the circular case (one cut yields one linear fragment of length $L$). Given the enzyme has exactly one site on this sequence, a linear starting molecule would necessarily yield two fragments, not one. Therefore, observing a single $L$-sized band allows a definitive conclusion of circular topology.\n- B. Two bands summing to $6\\,\\text{kb}$ corresponds to the linear case with one cut (fragments $x$ and $L-x$). This would argue against circular.\n- C. A single band at $3\\,\\text{kb}$ would require that $L=3\\,\\text{kb}$ or that there are two sites producing equal halves; both contradict the given single recognition site on a $6\\,\\text{kb}$ molecule.\n- D.

This practice simulates the process of in-silico digestion, a routine task for any molecular biologist. By using the known locations of restriction sites, you'll predict the sizes of the resulting DNA fragments, a core skill for designing new constructs and verifying the results of your experiments on an agarose gel.

The total length of the pGEN1 plasmid is 5.0 kilobase pairs (kb). A unique reference point on the plasmid is designated as coordinate 0 bp, and all positions are measured clockwise from this point, up to 5000 bp.

This problem tackles a common and frustrating issue in cloning workflows: the failure of an enzyme to digest a site located at the very end of a PCR product. Solving this requires moving beyond the simple DNA sequence and considering the enzyme's biochemical need for physical \"gripping room,\" a crucial insight for effective experimental design and troubleshooting. [@problem_id:2064052]", "problem": "A student in a synthetic biology lab is attempting to clone a gene, which they have amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). To facilitate subsequent ligation into a plasmid vector, they designed a forward primer that incorporates a recognition site for the restriction enzyme *Hin*dIII (AAGCTT). The structure of the primer's 5' end is `5'-AAGCTT...-3'`, meaning the recognition sequence is at the absolute 5'-terminus of the primer and, consequently, at the extreme 5'-end of the resulting PCR product.\n\nAfter successfully amplifying the gene and purifying the PCR product, the student proceeds with a restriction digest using the *Hin*dIII enzyme under optimal buffer and temperature conditions. Upon analyzing the reaction products, the student is surprised to find that the digestion has failed almost completely, with virtually all of the DNA remaining as a single, uncut band corresponding to the full-length PCR product.\n\nBelow are several statements concerning the potential reason for this failure and possible solutions to the problem.\n\n*   **Statement I (Reason):** Many restriction endonucleases require a short sequence of additional nucleotides flanking their recognition site to bind to the DNA substrate stably and exhibit catalytic activity. The absence of these flanking bases at the end of the linear PCR product prevents the enzyme from functioning efficiently.\n*   **Statement II (Reason):** The PCR-amplified DNA is unmethylated. Most restriction enzymes, including *Hin*dIII, can only cleave DNA that has been methylated at specific sites, a pattern typically established by the host organism's methyltransferases.\n*   **Statement III (Solution):** First, ligate the blunt-ended or A-tailed PCR product into a suitable intermediate cloning vector (a process known as subcloning). Then, isolate the resulting recombinant plasmid and digest it with *Hin*dIII.\n*   **Statement IV (Solution):** Redesign the forward primer to include a \"leader sequence\" of 5-7 arbitrary nucleotides (e.g., `5'-GCGTCA-AAGCTT...-3'`) upstream of the *Hin*dIII recognition site.\n*   **Statement V (Solution):** Significantly increase the concentration of the *Hin*dIII enzyme in the digestion reaction by at least 10-fold and double the incubation time to overcome the kinetic barrier.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the primary reason for the digestion failure and two distinct, effective solutions?\n\nA. Reason II is correct; the solutions are III and V.\n\nB. Reason I is correct; the solutions are IV and V.\n\nC. Reason II is correct; the solutions are III and IV.\n\nD. Reason I is correct; the solutions are III and IV.\n\nE. Reason I is correct; the solutions are III and V.", "solution": "We analyze the failure by invoking the known biochemical requirement for efficient restriction enzyme activity at DNA termini and then evaluate each statement.\n\nFirst, many restriction endonucleases require additional nonspecific base pairs flanking their recognition site for stable binding and efficient catalysis. When the recognition sequence is positioned at the extreme end of a linear DNA molecule, the enzyme often cannot make the necessary DNA contacts, leading to poor or absent cleavage. This is a well-established end-geometry effect documented by suppliers and in enzyme characterization. Therefore, Statement I correctly identifies the primary reason for failure.\n\nNext, regarding methylation, PCR products generated by standard DNA polymerases are unmethylated, and most Type II restriction endonucleases, including HindIII, do not require methylation for activity. In fact, methylation at certain motifs can inhibit cleavage for some enzymes, but HindIII does not require methylation and its site AAGCTT is not subject to common bacterial methylation systems (dam at GATC and dcm at CCWGG) nor to CpG methylation in the absence of a CG dinucleotide. Thus, Statement II is false.\n\nNow we evaluate the proposed solutions:\n- Statement III proposes subcloning the PCR fragment (blunt or A-tailed) into an intermediate plasmid, then digesting the resulting plasmid with HindIII. This places the HindIII site away from a DNA end and provides flanking plasmid sequence, enabling efficient enzyme binding and cleavage. This is an effective workaround and is correct.\n- Statement IV proposes redesigning the forward primer to include a short 5-7 nucleotide leader upstream of the HindIII site. This adds the necessary flanking bases on the PCR product and restores efficient digestion. This is standard best practice and is correct.\n- Statement V suggests substantially increasing enzyme concentration and incubation time. Because the limitation arises from insufficient binding contacts at the DNA end rather than purely from reaction kinetics, simply increasing enzyme and time is generally unreliable and often fails to rescue end-proximal sites. Therefore, Statement V is not an effective solution.\n\nCombining these, the correct option is that Reason I is correct, and the effective solutions are III and IV.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2064052"}]}
