A common plasmid for this work uses the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as a selectable marker. To establish an effective selection protocol, the team must first determine the baseline sensitivity of strain K-12b to chloramphenicol.\n\nThey perform a broth microdilution assay. This involves preparing a set of culture tubes, each containing the same growth medium but with different concentrations of chloramphenicol. An identical inoculum of strain K-12b is added to each tube. After 18 hours of incubation at the optimal growth temperature, a 100 microliter sample is taken from each tube, serially diluted, and spread onto an antibiotic-free agar plate to count the viable bacteria. The number of resulting colonies, known as Colony Forming Units (CFU), is recorded for each initial chloramphenicol concentration.\n\nFor this specific experiment, the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is quantitatively defined as the lowest tested concentration of the antibiotic that causes a 99.0% or greater reduction in the number of Colony Forming Units when compared to the antibiotic-free control culture.\n\nThe experimental results are provided in the table below:\n\n| Chloramphenicol Concentration (µg/mL) | Resulting Colony Forming Units (CFU) |\n|:---------------------------------------|:------------------------------------:|\n| 0.0                                    | 860                                  |\n| 1.0                                    | 755                                  |\n| 2.0                                    | 512                                  |\n| 4.0                                    | 198                                  |\n| 8.0                                    | 41                                   |\n| 16.0                                   | 7                                    |\n| 32.0                                   | 0                                    |\n| 64.0                                   | 0                                    |\n\nBased on this data, determine the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of chloramphenicol for strain K-12b.
