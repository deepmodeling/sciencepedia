Inducible promoters act as molecular switches, allowing us to turn genes on or off in response to specific chemical signals. This exercise [@problem_id:2038234] explores a common scenario in the lab, testing your understanding of how one of the most widely used inducible systems, the arabinose-inducible promoter, functions.", "problem": "A student in an introductory synthetic biology course is performing their first cloning experiment. They have successfully transformed *Escherichia coli* cells with a plasmid vector. This plasmid carries a gene encoding a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The expression of the GFP gene is under the control of the pBAD promoter, a well-characterized regulatory element derived from the arabinose operon. This promoter requires the binding of an activated AraC regulatory protein to initiate transcription.\n\nThe student prepares a nutrient agar medium, spreads the transformed *E. coli* cells on the plate, and incubates it overnight. The next day, a healthy lawn of bacterial colonies is observed on the plate. However, when the plate is placed on a blue light transilluminator, none of the colonies exhibit the expected green fluorescence. Assuming the transformation was successful and the plasmid sequence is correct, which one of the following single components was most likely omitted from the nutrient agar medium, thereby preventing the expression of GFP?\n\nA. Glucose\n\nB. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)\n\nC. Ampicillin\n\nD. Arabinose\n\nE. Anhydrotetracycline (aTc)", "solution": "The gene is under the pBAD promoter, which is regulated by AraC. The regulatory principle is that AraC in the absence of arabinose binds DNA to form a repressive loop, preventing transcription initiation. When arabinose is present, it binds AraC, converting it to an activator that facilitates RNA polymerase binding and transcription from pBAD. Therefore, induction of pBAD strictly requires arabinose; without arabinose, GFP is not expressed and colonies will not fluoresce.\n\nEvaluating each option with respect to whether its omission would prevent pBAD-driven GFP expression:\n- Glucose participates in catabolite repression; its presence can suppress pBAD expression via reduced cAMP–CRP activity. Omitting glucose would not prevent expression; if anything, it would favor induction. Thus omission of glucose is not the cause.\n- Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induces lac-based promoters, not pBAD. Its omission has no effect on pBAD.\n- Ampicillin is used for selection of transformants but is not required for promoter induction. Its omission would not intrinsically prevent GFP expression in transformed cells.\n- Arabinose is the required inducer for pBAD via AraC activation. Its omission directly prevents GFP expression.\n- Anhydrotetracycline (aTc) induces tet-based promoters, not pBAD. Its omission is irrelevant to pBAD.\n\nTherefore, the single omitted component that would prevent GFP expression from pBAD is arabinose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2038234"}, {"introduction": "Once you can control a gene's expression, the next challenge is often to optimize its output. You might be surprised to learn that 'silent' mutations, which don't change the amino acid sequence of a protein, can dramatically alter how much of that protein is actually made. This practice [@problem_id:2038274] delves into the concept of codon usage bias, using a simplified model to demonstrate how strategic changes to the DNA sequence can enhance translation efficiency.", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is working to express a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) in an *Escherichia coli* host. The team notices that the fluorescence output from their engineered bacteria is lower than expected. Upon sequencing a fragment of the messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) transcript for the RFP, they find the sequence $5'\\text{-GUA-CGC-AAA-}3'$. To improve expression, a bioinformatic tool suggests a silent mutation, changing the original sequence to a new sequence $5'\\text{-GUA-CGU-AAA-}3'$. Both the `CGC` and `CGU` codons encode for the amino acid Arginine, so the primary protein sequence is unchanged.\n\nThe efficiency of translation in *E. coli* is not uniform for all codons. A simplified model proposes that the local rate of protein synthesis is proportional to a \"Translational Efficiency Factor\" (TEF), which is related to the abundance of the corresponding transfer RNA. The overall translation rate for a short mRNA sequence is assumed to be proportional to the product of the TEFs for each codon in that sequence.\n\nThe TEFs for the relevant codons in *E. coli* are given in the table below:\n\n| Codon | Amino Acid | TEF   |\n|-------|------------|-------|\n| GUA   | Valine     | 0.65  |\n| CGC   | Arginine   | 0.42  |\n| CGU   | Arginine   | 0.91  |\n| AAA   | Lysine     | 0.88  |\n\nAssuming this model is accurate, calculate the ratio of the estimated translation rate of the new (mutated) mRNA fragment to the rate of the original mRNA fragment.

It is activated by the AraC protein only in the presence of arabinose.\n    *   `pLac`: An IPTG-inducible promoter. It is repressed by the LacI protein.

The target logic is $O=A \\land I$.\n\nRelevant biological rules:\n- AraC activates $pBad$ only when arabinose is present. Thus, $pBad$ drives its downstream gene with activity proportional to $A$.\n- LacI represses $pLac$; IPTG inactivates LacI. Thus, $pLac$ is active when $I=1$ and repressed when $I=0$.\n- $pT7$ is recognized only by T7 RNA polymerase; host RNA polymerase does not initiate from $pT7$.\n- The operator $lacO$ binds LacI to block transcription from a promoter when LacI is active; IPTG removes this block by inactivating LacI.\n\nEvaluate each design option against $O=A \\land I$:\n\nOption A: Two independent constructs $pBad \\to gfp$ and $pLac \\to gfp$.\n- $pBad \\to gfp$ yields GFP when $A=1$ (AraC with arabinose).\n- $pLac \\to gfp$ yields GFP when $I=1$ (LacI inactivated by IPTG).\n- Because the constructs are independent and additive, the output logic is $O = A \\lor I$, not $A \\land I$. Counterexample: $(A,I)=(0,1)$ gives $O=1$.\n\nOption B: $pBad \\to T7\\_RNAP$ and $pLac \\to gfp$.\n- $pLac \\to gfp$ alone yields GFP when $I=1$, irrespective of $A$ or T7 RNAP, because $pLac$ is read by host RNA polymerase.\n- Therefore $O=I$, not $A \\land I$. Counterexample: $(A,I)=(0,1)$ gives $O=1$.\n\nOption C: Single construct with tandem promoters $pBad \\to pLac \\to gfp$.\n- In a tandem arrangement, the downstream $pLac$ retains its own transcription start site and, when derepressed by IPTG, can drive $gfp$ even if $pBad$ is inactive. Thus, $I=1$ can produce GFP regardless of $A$.\n- Consequently, $O$ is not constrained to $A \\land I$ and at minimum satisfies $O \\geq I$, yielding a counterexample $(A,I)=(0,1)$ with $O=1$. Moreover, promoter interference makes this arrangement unreliable for strict AND logic.\n\nOption D: $pBad \\to T7\\_RNAP$ and $pT7\\_{lacO} \\to gfp$.\n- $pBad \\to T7\\_RNAP$ produces T7 RNA polymerase only when $A=1$.\n- $pT7$ requires T7 RNA polymerase; host polymerase cannot initiate at $pT7$. Thus, without T7 RNAP (i.e., when $A=0$), $gfp$ cannot be transcribed irrespective of $I$.\n- The $lacO$ operator on $pT7$ binds LacI and blocks transcription when LacI is active ($I=0$). IPTG inactivates LacI, relieving repression only when $I=1$.\n- Therefore, $gfp$ transcription from $pT7\\_{lacO}$ requires both the presence of T7 RNA polymerase ($A=1$) and relief of LacI repression ($I=1$). This implements $O = A \\land I$ with the truth table: $(A,I)=(0,0)\\Rightarrow O=0$, $(0,1)\\Rightarrow O=0$, $(1,0)\\Rightarrow O=0$, $(1,1)\\Rightarrow O=1$.\n\nHence only Option D realizes the required AND logic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2038267"}]}
