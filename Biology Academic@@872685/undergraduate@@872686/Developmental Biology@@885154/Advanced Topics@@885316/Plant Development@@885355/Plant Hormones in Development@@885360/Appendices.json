{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the link between a molecular defect and its whole-plant consequences is a cornerstone of developmental biology. This first exercise challenges you to do just that by considering ethylene, a gaseous hormone famous for orchestrating fruit ripening and leaf drop. By analyzing a hypothetical mutant that is \"blind\" to ethylene, you can practice predicting large-scale developmental changes based on a disruption in a single signaling pathway [@problem_id:1708382].", "problem": "A team of plant biologists is investigating a novel mutant variety of tomato, *Solanum lycopersicum*. This particular mutant possesses a loss-of-function mutation in all genes encoding for ethylene receptors. This mutation results in receptor proteins that are unable to bind to the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, effectively rendering the plant insensitive to its presence. Assuming the mutant plants are otherwise healthy and grown under standard agricultural conditions alongside wild-type (non-mutant) tomato plants, which of the following set of phenotypes would most likely be observed in the mutant variety compared to the wild-type?\n\nA. The fruits will fail to ripen or show severely delayed ripening, and senescent leaves will remain attached to the plant for an extended period.\n\nB. The fruits will ripen much faster and more uniformly, and the plant will undergo premature leaf shedding.\n\nC. The fruits will ripen normally, but the plant will retain its leaves for much longer, showing delayed leaf abscission.\n\nD. The fruits will fail to ripen, but the plant will exhibit accelerated shedding of its leaves.\n\nE. Both fruit ripening and leaf shedding will occur normally, but the plant's stems will be significantly thicker and shorter.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physiological roles of ethylene and the consequences of ethylene insensitivity, then map these expectations onto the options.\n\nFirst principle: In climacteric fruits like tomato, ethylene is both necessary and sufficient to trigger and coordinate the ripening program. Experimental observations in tomato demonstrate that exogenous ethylene accelerates ripening, while blocking ethylene synthesis, perception, or downstream signaling abolishes or severely delays ripening. Therefore, any condition that renders tissues insensitive to ethylene will result in failure or strong delay of fruit ripening.\n\nSecond principle: Ethylene promotes organ senescence and abscission (shedding), including leaf abscission, typically acting in concert with changing auxin transport/signals at the abscission zone. When ethylene signaling is blocked or tissues are insensitive to ethylene, leaf abscission is reduced or delayed, and senescent leaves tend to remain attached longer than in wild type.\n\nThird principle: Ethylene signaling mechanics clarify why loss of perception yields insensitivity. Ethylene is perceived by a family of receptors (e.g., ETR/ERS types). In the absence of ethylene, these receptors actively repress ethylene responses via CTR1 kinase, keeping downstream responses off. When ethylene binds, receptor activity is inactivated, CTR1 repression is relieved, and ethylene responses are turned on. If receptor proteins cannot bind ethylene and the plant is functionally insensitive (as stated), the repression remains in place and ethylene responses fail to initiate, phenocopying an ethylene-deprived state. Empirically, tomato mutants defective in ethylene perception (e.g., Never-ripe) show delayed or blocked ripening and reduced abscission.\n\nApplying these principles to the options:\n- Option A predicts failure or severe delay of fruit ripening and prolonged leaf attachment. This matches the expected outcomes of ethylene insensitivity in tomato: impaired climacteric ripening and delayed abscission.\n- Option B predicts faster ripening and premature leaf shedding, which are hallmarks of ethylene hypersensitivity or ethylene overproduction, the opposite of insensitivity.\n- Option C predicts normal ripening but delayed leaf abscission, which is inconsistent because ethylene insensitivity would impair both processes.\n- Option D predicts failed ripening but accelerated leaf shedding, which is internally inconsistent with ethylene biology because both ripening and abscission are promoted by ethylene; insensitivity would not accelerate abscission.\n- Option E predicts normal ripening and abscission but thicker, shorter stems. Ethylene promotes the classic triple response leading to reduced elongation and radial swelling in etiolated seedlings; ethylene insensitivity tends to reduce these responses (often leading to longer, not shorter, stems). Moreover, E ignores the major ethylene-controlled processes in question (ripening and abscission), making it inconsistent.\n\nNote on wording: Although the prompt describes the alleles as loss-of-function and unable to bind ethylene while also stating the plants are ethylene-insensitive, the key functional outcome specified (insensitivity to ethylene) determines the phenotypic predictions above. Under that specified outcome, Option A is the consistent choice.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype set most likely observed is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708382"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the what to the how, this problem delves into the intricate logic of a hormone signaling cascade. Many pathways, like the gibberellin (GA) pathway, rely on negative regulation, where growth is actively repressed until a hormone signal removes the repressor. This practice [@problem_id:1708440] asks you to predict the outcome when this removal process is broken, providing a deeper insight into how protein degradation serves as a critical control switch in development.", "problem": "In plant development, the Gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating processes such as stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering. The signaling cascade is mediated by a family of transcriptional repressors known as DELLA proteins. In the absence of GA, DELLA proteins are active and bind to transcription factors, preventing the expression of growth-promoting genes. When GA is present, it binds to its soluble receptor, GID1. This GA-GID1 complex then binds to a DELLA protein, targeting it for degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. The removal of the DELLA repressor allows for the expression of downstream genes, leading to growth.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a plant biologist creates a transgenic plant line. This line is engineered to strongly overexpress a mutated version of a DELLA protein. This specific mutation prevents the DELLA protein from being recognized and degraded by the proteasome, but it does not affect its ability to bind to DNA and repress transcription.\n\nWhich of the following phenotypes would be most expected in this transgenic plant line?\n\nA. Severe dwarfism, reduced seed germination, and delayed flowering, a phenotype that cannot be reversed by the external application of GA.\n\nB. Excessive stem elongation, early and continuous flowering, and a tendency for seeds to germinate prematurely, similar to a plant that overproduces GA.\n\nC. A phenotype indistinguishable from the wild-type, as the endogenous GA would eventually overcome the effects of the mutated protein.\n\nD. A phenotype characteristic of constitutive ethylene response, including a shortened and thickened hypocotyl, an exaggerated apical hook, and inhibited root elongation.\n\nE. Severe dwarfism, reduced seed germination, and delayed flowering, but these traits are fully restored to wild-type levels upon treatment with a high concentration of external GA.", "solution": "- Principle of GA-DELLA signaling: In the absence of GA, DELLA proteins act as transcriptional repressors that bind transcription factors to inhibit growth-promoting gene expression. When GA is present, it binds to its receptor GID1 to form a GA-GID1 complex. This complex recruits DELLA proteins, targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. Removal of DELLA derepresses growth genes, enabling processes such as stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering.\n- Define components symbolically: Let $D$ denote a native DELLA protein, $G$ denote GA, $R$ denote GID1, and $C$ denote the GA-GID1-DELLA complex whose formation leads to proteasomal degradation of $D$. For native DELLA, GA responsiveness implies that, upon GA addition, the effective degradation rate $k_{\\text{deg}}$ of $D$ increases, thereby reducing $[D]$ and allowing growth gene expression to proceed.\n- Experimental manipulation: The transgenic plant strongly overexpresses a mutated DELLA, denoted $D^{*}$, with two defining properties: (i) it is not recognized for proteasomal degradation (i.e., even after GA-GID1 binding steps, it is not effectively targeted to the 26S proteasome), and (ii) it retains its ability to bind transcription factors and repress transcription. Operationally, for $D^{*}$, the effective degradation rate remains $k_{\\text{deg}}^{*} \\approx 0$ with respect to the GA-dependent pathway, so $[D^{*}]$ remains high irrespective of $[G]$.\n- Consequence for signaling dynamics: Because $D^{*}$ cannot be cleared by the GA-GID1 pathway, the steady-state concentration of active repressor remains high even under saturating $G$. Thus, the transcriptional repression remains constitutive. Since the line strongly overexpresses $D^{*}$, the total repressor pool is dominated by $D^{*}$, so endogenous $D$ dynamics become negligible relative to $D^{*}$.\n- Predicted phenotype from constitutive DELLA repression: Persistent repression of growth-promoting genes leads to classic GA-deficient-like traits: severe dwarfism (inhibited stem elongation), reduced seed germination, and delayed flowering. Because $D^{*}$ is GA-insensitive at the level of degradation, external GA cannot relieve repression; the phenotype is GA-insensitive.\n- Evaluate options:\n  - A: Predicts severe dwarfism, reduced seed germination, delayed flowering, and non-rescue by GA. This matches the logic above, given $k_{\\text{deg}}^{*} \\approx 0$.\n  - B: Predicts GA overproduction-like phenotypes (elongation, early flowering, precocious germination), which would arise from loss of DELLA function or enhanced GA degradation of DELLA, not from stabilized DELLA. Inconsistent.\n  - C: Predicts wild-type phenotype because endogenous GA would overcome the mutation. This contradicts the stabilization of $D^{*}$ and its dominant repressive effect; GA cannot promote its degradation.\n  - D: Describes constitutive ethylene response, unrelated to GA-DELLA stabilization. Inconsistent with the manipulated pathway.\n  - E: Predicts severe repression phenotypes but full rescue with high external GA. This is incompatible with proteasome-resistant $D^{*}$, since even high $[G]$ cannot increase $k_{\\text{deg}}^{*}$ to clear the repressor.\n- Therefore, the most expected phenotype is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708440"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of a biologist is not just to understand known systems but to design experiments that reveal new principles. This final practice puts you in the role of an experimentalist, tasked with untangling a complex plant response to its environment. By interpreting a set of grafting experiments, you will learn how to distinguish between local, cell-autonomous processes and systemic, long-distance signals, a fundamental challenge in understanding how a plant functions as an integrated organism [@problem_id:1708390].", "problem": "The architecture of a plant's root system is highly plastic and adapts to the availability of soil nutrients. For instance, in many plant species, high concentrations of nitrate in the soil are known to suppress the emergence of lateral roots from the primary root. Two competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon.\n\nThe **Local-Autonomy Hypothesis** posits that root cells perceive the high external nitrate concentration and, in response, locally synthesize and accumulate cytokinin, a plant hormone known to inhibit lateral root emergence. In this model, the suppression is a root-autonomous process.\n\nThe **Systemic-Signal Hypothesis** proposes a long-distance communication route. In this model, the root perceives high nitrate and sends a signal (often called the \"nitrate-starvation signal\" is suppressed) to the shoot. The shoot, in response, synthesizes cytokinin and transports it downwards via the phloem to the root system, where it inhibits lateral root emergence.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, a series of grafting experiments is conducted using wild-type (WT) plants and a quadruple mutant, `ipt1,3,5,7`, which is severely deficient in the biosynthesis of cytokinin. For the purpose of this problem, assume the `ipt1,3,5,7` mutation primarily abolishes cytokinin production in the shoot, while cytokinin production in the root, although also reduced, is less critical for the systemic response.\n\nFour types of grafted plants are constructed (Scion / Rootstock): WT/WT, `ipt1,3,5,7`/`ipt1,3,5,7`, WT/`ipt1,3,5,7`, and `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT. All four types of grafts are grown on a growth medium containing a uniformly high concentration of nitrate. Let \"high density of emerged lateral roots\" describe a phenotype where suppression is absent, and \"low density of emerged lateral roots\" describe a phenotype where suppression is active.\n\nAssuming the **Systemic-Signal Hypothesis** is correct, which of the following outcomes would be observed for the lateral root emergence phenotypes of the two chimeric grafts?\n\nA. The `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT graft will exhibit a high density of emerged lateral roots, while the WT/`ipt1,3,5,7` graft will exhibit a low density.\n\nB. The `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT graft will exhibit a low density of emerged lateral roots, while the WT/`ipt1,3,5,7` graft will exhibit a high density.\n\nC. Both the `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT and the WT/`ipt1,3,5,7` grafts will exhibit a high density of emerged lateral roots.\n\nD. Both the `ipt1,3,5,7`/WT and the WT/`ipt1,3,5,7` grafts will exhibit a low density of emerged lateral roots.\n\nE. The experiment is inconclusive, as the lateral root phenotype would depend on auxin transport efficiency, which is not defined for the mutant.", "solution": "We are comparing two mechanistic hypotheses for nitrate-induced suppression of lateral root emergence: a local-autonomous model versus a systemic-signal model. The grafting experiment is designed to test whether shoot-derived cytokinin is required for suppression under uniformly high external nitrate.\n\nGiven the Systemic-Signal Hypothesis:\n- The root senses high nitrate and sends a signal to the shoot.\n- The shoot synthesizes cytokinin in response and transports it via the phloem to the root system.\n- Suppression of lateral root emergence in high nitrate thus depends critically on the shoot’s ability to produce cytokinin; local cytokinin production in the root is less critical for the systemic response (as stated).\n\nGenotypes and expectations for chimeric grafts:\n\n1) For the ipt1,3,5,7/WT graft (mutant scion on wild-type rootstock):\n- The scion (shoot) is deficient in cytokinin biosynthesis due to the ipt1,3,5,7 mutation, which primarily abolishes cytokinin production in the shoot.\n- Under high nitrate, the rootstock (WT) will send the signal to the shoot, but the mutant shoot cannot produce sufficient cytokinin.\n- Consequently, little to no cytokinin is transported back to the roots.\n- Without shoot-derived cytokinin, suppression fails, leading to a high density of emerged lateral roots.\n\n2) For the WT/ipt1,3,5,7 graft (wild-type scion on mutant rootstock):\n- The scion (shoot) is wild-type and capable of cytokinin biosynthesis.\n- Under high nitrate, the rootstock (ipt1,3,5,7) will send the signal to the shoot; the WT shoot produces cytokinin and delivers it to the roots via the phloem.\n- Root-local cytokinin production is less critical; the imported shoot-derived cytokinin is sufficient to suppress lateral root emergence.\n- Therefore, suppression is active, leading to a low density of emerged lateral roots.\n\nThese outcomes map directly onto option A: ipt1,3,5,7/WT shows high density, and WT/ipt1,3,5,7 shows low density. All other options contradict the central systemic prediction that the shoot genotype controls the presence of the inhibitory cytokinin signal under high nitrate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708390"}]}
