The first critical step is to determine how many different genes you have actually identified. This exercise introduces the complementation test, a powerful and elegant cross that answers this fundamental question by allowing you to group mutations into distinct functional units, or genes.

Let's call these strains `mutant-1` and `mutant-2`. Both mutations are known to be recessive to the wild-type allele that confers normal wings. The biologist's goal is to determine if these two mutations are alleles of the same gene or if they are mutations in two different genes, both of which are required for proper wing formation.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs and interpretations correctly and most directly addresses this question?\n\nA. Cross flies from the `mutant-1` strain with flies from the `mutant-2` strain. If the F1 generation offspring have normal wings, the mutations are in different genes. If the F1 offspring are wingless, the mutations are alleles of the same gene.\n\nB. Cross flies from the `mutant-1` strain with wild-type flies.

Then, intercross the F1 flies to produce an F2 generation. The allelic relationship can only be determined by analyzing the phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation.\n\nE. Self-cross flies from the `mutant-1` strain and self-cross flies from the `mutant-2` strain. If the offspring from both crosses are 100% wingless, then the mutations must be in different genes.", "solution": "We are given two independently isolated, true-breeding recessive mutants with the same phenotype (wingless) in Drosophila. To determine whether the mutations are allelic (in the same gene) or in different genes required for the same pathway, the classical approach is a complementation test: cross the two homozygous recessive mutant strains and inspect the F1 phenotype.\n\nLet wing formation require functional products of two genes, $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$. Denote wild-type alleles by $G_{i}$ and recessive loss-of-function alleles by $g_{i}$.\n\nCase 1 (mutations in different genes; complementation expected):\nTake mutant-1 to be $g_{1}/g_{1};\\,G_{2}/G_{2}$ and mutant-2 to be $G_{1}/G_{1};\\,g_{2}/g_{2}$.\nCrossing these gives F1:\n$$\n\\text{F1: } G_{1}/g_{1};\\,G_{2}/g_{2}.\n$$\nEach gene has at least one functional allele ($G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$), so the F1 produces functional products for both genes, yielding normal wings. This is complementation, indicating the mutations are in different genes.\n\nCase 2 (mutations are alleles of the same gene; no complementation):\nLet both mutations affect $G_{1}$ but be independent alleles. Write mutant-1 as $g_{1}^{(1)}/g_{1}^{(1)}$ and mutant-2 as $g_{1}^{(2)}/g_{1}^{(2)}$. Crossing these yields:\n$$\n\\text{F1: } g_{1}^{(1)}/g_{1}^{(2)}.\n$$\nThere is no wild-type allele $G_{1}$ present. Given both are recessive loss-of-function alleles of the same gene, the F1 lacks functional $G_{1}$ product and remains wingless. This is non-complementation, indicating both mutations are alleles of the same gene.\n\nTherefore, the correct experimental design is to cross mutant-1 with mutant-2 and score the F1 phenotype; interpretation is:\n- F1 normal wings implies mutations are in different genes.\n- F1 wingless implies mutations are alleles of the same gene.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A matches the complementation test and its correct interpretation.\n- B is incorrect: crossing a recessive mutant to wild type will generally yield normal F1 regardless of whether the two mutants affect the same or different genes; it does not compare mutant-1 to mutant-2.\n- C reverses the interpretation and is therefore incorrect.\n- D is unnecessary; F2 analysis is not required to determine allelism for recessive mutations; the F1 suffices.\n- E is uninformative: true-breeding recessive lines will self-cross to 100 percent mutant by definition and does not address allelism.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1687907"}, {"introduction": "Once you have established that two different genes are involved in the same biological process, the next question is how they relate to each other. Do they work in a linear sequence, and if so, which gene acts first? This practice problem demonstrates the concept of epistasis, where the phenotype of a double mutant can reveal the functional hierarchy within a genetic pathway. [@problem_id:1687941]", "problem": "In a forward genetic screen in a model organism to identify genes involved in eye development, a developmental biologist isolates a mutant line, which they name *anophthalmia* (*ano*). Individuals homozygous for a recessive loss-of-function allele in this gene ($ano/ano$) are viable but are born completely without eyes.\n\nTo understand the genetic pathway, the biologist performs further experiments. They introduce a mutation in a second, newly discovered gene, called *blindspot* (*bli*), into the $ano/ano$ background, creating a double mutant line with the genotype $ano/ano ; bli/bli$. Upon examining these double mutants, the biologist observes that they are also born completely without eyes.\n\nBased solely on these experimental observations, which of the following statements represents the most accurate and certain conclusion about the genetic relationship between `ano` and `bli`?\n\nA. Gene `bli` is epistatic to gene `ano`.\n\nB. Gene `ano` is epistatic to gene `bli`.\n\nC. Genes `ano` and `bli` have genetically redundant functions.\n\nD. Genes `ano` and `bli` must function in the same linear developmental pathway.\n\nE. The phenotype of a $bli/bli$ single mutant must be identical to that of an `ano/ano` mutant.", "solution": "We are given that a recessive loss-of-function mutation in gene ano causes a fully penetrant anophthalmic phenotype: ano/ano individuals lack eyes. The double mutant ano/ano ; bli/bli also lacks eyes.\n\nThe classical operational definition of epistasis in double-mutant analysis is that, in a double mutant between two recessive loss-of-function alleles, the phenotype that is observed is said to be epistatic; the gene whose single-mutant phenotype matches the double-mutant phenotype is considered epistatic to the other. Strictly, assigning epistasis requires knowledge of both single-mutant phenotypes so that one can determine which phenotype the double mutant matches.\n\nHere, the only single-mutant phenotype we know is ano/ano, which lacks eyes. The double mutant matches this phenotype. This observation is consistent with, and commonly interpreted as, gene ano being epistatic to gene bli, because the ano mutation’s phenotype is the one that is manifest in the double mutant, i.e., any effect of the bli mutation (whatever it may be) is masked in the presence of the ano mutation. Although we cannot exclude possibilities such as bli/bli alone having the same phenotype as ano/ano, the only choice that accords with the observed double-mutant equaling the ano phenotype is that ano is epistatic to bli.\n\nThe other options are not supported:\n- It is not justified to claim bli is epistatic to ano (A), because the double-mutant phenotype does not provide evidence that the double matches the unknown bli single-mutant phenotype.\n- Genetic redundancy (C) is contradicted by the fact that the ano single mutant already shows a complete loss of eyes; redundancy would typically yield no phenotype in either single mutant but a phenotype in the double.\n- We cannot conclude they must function in the same linear pathway (D); parallel pathways or independent requirements could also yield the same double-mutant outcome.\n- It is not required that the bli/bli single mutant phenotype be identical to ano/ano (E); it could be wild type, partially affected, or identical, and the current data do not resolve this.\n\nTherefore, among the provided statements, the most accurate and certain conclusion supported by the single known single-mutant phenotype and the double-mutant outcome is that gene ano is epistatic to gene bli.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1687941"}, {"introduction": "Not all mutations are simple recessive, loss-of-function alleles. Dominant mutations, which cause a phenotype even with a single mutant copy, present a fascinating puzzle: is the gene dosage simply insufficient (haploinsufficiency), or is the mutant protein actively interfering with the normal one (a dominant-negative effect)? This advanced problem challenges you to interpret a specific genetic cross designed to distinguish between these two important molecular mechanisms. [@problem_id:1687919]", "problem": "You are studying a dominant mutation in *Drosophila melanogaster* called *Wing-up* (*Wup*), which causes adult flies to hold their wings vertically at rest, rendering them incapable of flight. The gene associated with this mutation is located on an autosome, and its wild-type allele is denoted as $+$. Heterozygous flies ($+/Wup$) are flightless but are otherwise viable and fertile. You want to determine the molecular basis of the $Wup$ allele's dominance.\n\nYou have formulated two competing hypotheses:\n1.  **Haploinsufficiency (HI)**: The $Wup$ allele is effectively a null (complete loss-of-function) allele, and a single dose of the wild-type gene product is insufficient to support normal function for flight.\n2.  **Dominant-Negative (DN) Effect**: The $Wup$ allele produces a mutant protein product that actively interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the $+$ allele, thereby 'poisoning' the molecular machinery required for flight.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, you have obtained a special *Drosophila* stock that carries a small, freely segregating chromosomal duplication, which we can denote as `Dp(+)`. This duplication carries a wild-type copy of the *Wup* gene. You perform a genetic cross between a flightless $+/Wup$ fly and a true-breeding wild-type fly that is also homozygous for the duplication (genotype: $+/+ ; Dp(+)/Dp(+)$).\n\nConsider the F1 progeny from this cross that inherit the $Wup$ allele from one parent and the `Dp(+)` from the other.

The outcome would be identical under both hypotheses.", "solution": "The user wants to distinguish between two mechanisms for a dominant mutation, haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative effect, using a genetic cross with a chromosomal duplication.\n\nFirst, let's determine the genotypes of the parents and their gametes.\nParent 1 is a heterozygous flightless fly with genotype `+/Wup`. It will produce two types of gametes in equal proportions: `+` and `Wup`.\nParent 2 is from a true-breeding stock that is wild-type and homozygous for the duplication. Its genotype is `+/+; Dp(+)/Dp(+)`. Since it is homozygous for both the wild-type allele on the regular chromosome and the duplication, it produces only one type of gamete: `+; Dp(+)`.\n\nNext, we establish the genotypes of the F1 progeny by combining the gametes from both parents.\n- Gamete from P1 (`+`) + Gamete from P2 (`+; Dp(+)`)  -> Progeny Genotype 1: `+/+; Dp(+)`\n- Gamete from P1 (`Wup`) + Gamete from P2 (`+; Dp(+)`) -> Progeny Genotype 2: `+/Wup; Dp(+)`\n\nThe problem asks for the phenotype of the \"key experimental progeny,\" which is the one that allows us to test the hypotheses. This is the progeny that carries the mutation (`Wup`) and the experimental tool (the duplication, `Dp(+)`); thus, we must analyze the phenotype of the `+/Wup; Dp(+)` flies.\n\nThis key progeny has three copies of the gene in total: one wild-type allele (`+`) on a regular autosome, one mutant allele (`Wup`) on the homologous autosome, and a second wild-type allele (`+`) on the duplication `Dp(+)`.\n\nNow, we predict the phenotype of this `+/Wup; Dp(+)` fly under each hypothesis.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Haploinsufficiency (HI)**\nUnder this hypothesis, `Wup` is a null allele, meaning it produces no functional protein. The phenotype is determined by the dosage of the functional, wild-type (`+`) gene product.\n- A wild-type fly (`+/+`) has two doses of `+` product and can fly.\n- The original mutant fly (`+/Wup`) has only one dose of `+` product, which is insufficient, causing the flightless phenotype.\n- Our experimental progeny (`+/Wup; Dp(+)`) has one `+` allele on the chromosome and another `+` allele on the duplication. The `Wup` allele contributes no function. Therefore, this fly has a total of two functional doses of the gene product.\n- Since two doses of the `+` product are sufficient for a wild-type phenotype (as seen in `+/+` flies), the phenotype of the experimental progeny will be rescued.\n- **HI Prediction: Flying.**\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Dominant-Negative (DN) Effect**\nUnder this hypothesis, the `Wup` allele produces a \"poison\" protein that interferes with the wild-type protein.\n- The original mutant fly (`+/Wup`) produces both wild-type protein (from `+`) and poison protein (from `Wup`) in a roughly 1:1 ratio. This interference disrupts function, leading to a flightless phenotype.\n- Our experimental progeny (`+/Wup; Dp(+)`) produces wild-type protein from two gene copies (`+` on the chromosome and `+` on the `Dp(+)`) and poison protein from one gene copy (`Wup`).\n- Even though there is now more wild-type protein relative to the mutant protein (a 2:1 ratio), the presence of the poison protein is still expected to disrupt the function of the molecular complex or pathway. For a definitive test, we assume the presence of any \"poison\" product is sufficient to cause a mutant phenotype. The cellular machinery is still compromised.\n- Therefore, the fly will not have normal function.\n- **DN Prediction: Flightless.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy combining the two predictions, we get:\n- For Haploinsufficiency (HI), the phenotype is **Flying**.\n- For the Dominant-Negative (DN) effect, the phenotype is **Flightless**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option \"HI: Flying, DN: Flightless\".\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1687919"}]}
