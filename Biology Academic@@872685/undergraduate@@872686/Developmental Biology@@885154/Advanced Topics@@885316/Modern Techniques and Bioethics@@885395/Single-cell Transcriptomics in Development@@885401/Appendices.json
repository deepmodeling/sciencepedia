This first exercise demonstrates the most direct way to achieve this: using a feature plot to visualize the expression of a single, well-established marker gene. By mapping the expression of the myogenic marker *MyoD*, you will practice how to visually identify a target cell lineage amidst thousands of other cells [@problem_id:1714785].", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating cell fate specification in a developing mouse embryo using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq), a technique that measures the complete set of gene expression levels for thousands of individual cells. The resulting high-dimensional data is visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a dimensionality reduction method. In the resulting UMAP plot, each point represents a single cell, and cells with similar overall gene expression patterns are positioned close to one another, often forming distinct clusters that correspond to different cell types or states.\n\nThe biologist wants to identify the population of cells that are part of the myocyte (developing muscle cell) lineage. It is well-established that the gene *MyoD* is a primary marker for this lineage, meaning it is expressed at a high level in myocyte precursors and at very low-to-no levels in other cell types. To pinpoint these cells, the biologist generates a \"feature plot.\" This plot is the same UMAP visualization, but now each cell is colored according to its expression level of the *MyoD* gene. The color scale is set such that low expression is colored grey and high expression is colored bright red.\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following descriptions most accurately represents the expected appearance of the *MyoD* feature plot, allowing the biologist to successfully identify the myocyte lineage?\n\nA. A specific, localized group of cells that are clustered together on the UMAP plot will be colored bright red, while the vast majority of other cells on the plot will be colored grey.\n\nB. Cells scattered randomly throughout the entire UMAP plot will be colored bright red, with no discernible pattern or grouping.\n\nC. A specific, localized group of cells that are clustered together on the UMAP plot will be colored grey, while most other cells on the plot will be colored bright red.\n\nD. All cells located on the far-right side of the UMAP plot will be colored bright red, regardless of their clustering.\n\nE. The plot will be divided into two large, contiguous regions of roughly equal size, one colored entirely bright red and the other entirely grey.", "solution": "We interpret the problem using established principles of scRNA-seq visualization and marker-based lineage identification:\n\n1. UMAP arranges cells such that those with similar global gene expression profiles cluster near each other. Distinct cell types or lineages typically form localized clusters in the UMAP embedding.\n\n2. A feature plot overlays the expression of a single gene onto the UMAP by coloring each point (cell) according to the expression level of that gene. If a gene is a specific lineage marker, high expression should coincide with the cluster(s) corresponding to that lineage, while non-lineage cells should show low-to-no expression.\n\n3. The gene MyoD is a primary marker for the myocyte lineage, meaning it is expected to be expressed at high levels in myocyte precursors and at very low levels in other cell types.\n\n4. Therefore, the expected MyoD feature plot should show:\n   - A specific, localized cluster (or closely related cluster(s)) corresponding to myocyte precursors colored bright red (high expression).\n   - The vast majority of other cells colored grey (low or no expression), reflecting the specificity of the marker.\n\n5. Evaluate the options:\n   - A: Matches the expectation for a specific lineage marker—localized bright red cluster with others grey. This allows clear identification of the myocyte lineage.\n   - B: Random scattered red cells suggest no coherent lineage-specific expression pattern; inconsistent with a well-established specific marker.\n   - C: Inverts the expected pattern; would imply MyoD is low in the myocyte cluster and high elsewhere, contradicting its role as a specific myogenic marker.\n   - D: Coloring all cells on one side bright red irrespective of clustering suggests a spatial artifact unrelated to expression-based clustering, not expected for a biologically meaningful marker plot.\n   - E: Two large contiguous halves of red and grey imply a global batch effect or a broadly expressed gene, not a lineage-specific marker.\n\n6.
