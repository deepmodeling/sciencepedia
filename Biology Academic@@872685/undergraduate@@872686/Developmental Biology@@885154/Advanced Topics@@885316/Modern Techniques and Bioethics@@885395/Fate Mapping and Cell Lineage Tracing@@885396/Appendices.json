{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of developmental biology is understanding how the earliest cell populations in an embryo give rise to distinct tissues. The Cre-Lox system provides a powerful genetic tool for permanently marking a specific cell type and all of its descendants, allowing us to build definitive fate maps. This first exercise [@problem_id:1686674] challenges you to predict the outcome of a classic lineage tracing experiment designed to distinguish the fates of the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in the mouse blastocyst.", "problem": "A developmental biologist wants to definitively establish the developmental fates of the two primary cell populations in a mouse blastocyst: the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) and the Trophectoderm (TE). To do this, she designs a genetic lineage tracing experiment using the Cre-Lox system.\n\nShe uses two transgenic mouse lines:\n1.  **Cre Driver Line**: This mouse line contains a gene construct where the expression of Cre recombinase, an enzyme that excises DNA segments flanked by LoxP sites, is controlled by a promoter named `Tepro-1`. The `Tepro-1` promoter is known to be active *only* in the cells of the Trophectoderm during the blastocyst stage and is inactive in all other cell types and at all other developmental stages.\n2.  **Reporter Line**: This mouse line contains a gene construct ubiquitously inserted into the genome of all cells. The construct is arranged as follows: a strong, constitutively active promoter, followed by a DNA \"stop\" sequence flanked by two LoxP sites, followed by the coding sequence for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). In its default state, the stop sequence prevents the transcription of the GFP gene. However, if Cre recombinase is present in a cell, it will permanently excise the LoxP-flanked stop sequence, leading to irreversible and continuous expression of GFP in that cell and all of its descendants.\n\nThe biologist crosses the Cre Driver Line with the Reporter Line. Embryos that inherit both constructs are identified at the blastocyst stage, transferred to a surrogate mother, and allowed to develop to term. Assuming the experiment works as designed and based on the established model of mammalian development, what is the expected pattern of GFP expression in the resulting new-born mouse (the fetus proper) and its associated placenta?\n\nA. GFP is expressed throughout the tissues of the fetus proper, but no GFP is observed in the placenta.\n\nB. GFP is expressed throughout the tissues of the placenta, but no GFP is observed in the fetus proper.\n\nC. GFP is expressed in a patchy, mosaic pattern in some tissues of both the fetus proper and the placenta.\n\nD. GFP is expressed in neither the fetus proper nor the placenta, as the `Tepro-1` promoter's activity is too transient.\n\nE. GFP is expressed in all tissues of both the fetus proper and the placenta.", "solution": "Cre-Lox lineage tracing relies on site-specific recombination that is both irreversible and heritable within a labeled lineage. In the reporter line used here, a constitutive promoter drives a transcriptional unit in which a LoxP-flanked stop cassette prevents GFP transcription. If Cre recombinase is expressed in a cell, it excises the stop cassette between the LoxP sites, permanently activating GFP in that cell and all of its descendants. Cells that never experience Cre activity retain the stop cassette and remain GFP negative.\n\nIn the cross described, Cre expression is driven by the Tepro-1 promoter, which is active only in Trophectoderm (TE) cells at the blastocyst stage and is inactive in all other cells and at all other times. Therefore, recombination occurs exclusively in TE cells during the blastocyst stage, permanently marking TE cells and their progeny with GFP. Inner Cell Mass (ICM) cells do not express Cre at any time, so their reporter remains unrecombined and GFP remains off in the ICM and its descendants.\n\nBy established mammalian fate mapping, TE gives rise to trophoblast lineages that constitute the placenta, whereas the ICM gives rise to the epiblast that forms the fetus proper. Consequently, after development to term, tissues derived from TE (the placenta’s trophoblast components) will be GFP positive, while tissues derived from the ICM (the fetus proper) will be GFP negative. The transient nature of Cre expression is irrelevant to label persistence, because the recombination event is permanent and propagated through cell divisions within the TE lineage.\n\nEvaluating the choices: A is incorrect because the fetus proper derives from ICM, which never expressed Cre. C is incorrect because mosaic labeling in both lineages would require Cre activity in subsets of both TE and ICM or stochastic Cre action outside TE, which contradicts the promoter specification. D is incorrect because transient Cre is sufficient for irreversible recombination. E is incorrect because only TE cells express Cre. The expected pattern is GFP throughout the placenta’s trophoblast-derived tissues, with no GFP in the fetus proper, matching option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1686674"}, {"introduction": "While Cre-Lox is dominant in vertebrate models, other systems like the FLP/FRT system in *Drosophila* offer unique advantages, such as the ability to induce recombination in individual cells during development. This process, known as mitotic recombination, can generate \"twin spots\" where the two daughters of a single mitotic event are marked differently, providing powerful clonal analysis. This practice problem [@problem_id:1686663] explores the genetic basis of twin spot formation and how it reveals the consequences of a single recombination event.", "problem": "In developmental biology research using *Drosophila melanogaster*, the Flippase/Flippase Recognition Target (FLP/FRT) system is a powerful tool for lineage tracing. This system utilizes the FLP recombinase enzyme to induce site-specific recombination at FRT sites engineered into the genome.\n\nConsider a female *Drosophila* larva whose somatic cells are heterozygous for two recessive, X-linked mutations: *yellow* (*y*), which results in a yellow cuticle, and *singed* (*sn*), which causes short, gnarled bristles. The corresponding wild-type alleles ($y^+$ and $sn^+$) result in a normal brown cuticle and straight bristles, and are dominant. Both genes are located on the chromosome arm distal to an FRT site. The genotype of the two homologous X chromosomes in the larva's somatic cells is as follows:\n\n- X Chromosome 1: `[Centromere]----FRT----`$y^+$`----`$sn^+$\n- X Chromosome 2: `[Centromere]----FRT----y----sn`\n\nThe larva also carries a separate transgene that allows for the expression of FLP recombinase throughout the body for a short period upon a mild heat shock. During development, a heat shock is administered, inducing a single mitotic recombination event at the FRT sites in a single dividing cell within an imaginal disc. Following this recombination, the cell completes mitosis. A specific segregation of chromosomes during anaphase then leads to the formation of a \"twin spot,\" in which the two resulting daughter cells are phenotypically distinct from each other and from the surrounding heterozygous tissue.\n\nAssuming the segregation event that produces a twin spot occurs, which of the following correctly describes the genotypes and resulting observable phenotypes of the two daughter cells that initiate this twin spot?\n\nA. One cell is `y+/y`, `sn+/sn` (wild-type phenotype), and the other is `y/y`, `sn/sn` (yellow and singed phenotype).\n\nB. One cell is homozygous `$y^+/y^+$`, `$sn^+/sn^+$` (wild-type phenotype), and the other is homozygous `y/y`, `sn/sn` (yellow and singed phenotype).\n\nC. Both cells are homozygous `y/y`, `sn/sn` (yellow and singed phenotype).\n\nD. One cell is `$y^+/y^+$`, `sn/sn` (wild-type color, singed bristles), and the other is `y/y`, `$sn^+/sn^+$` (yellow color, wild-type bristles).\n\nE. This event cannot produce a twin spot; all daughter cells will remain heterozygous and have a wild-type phenotype.", "solution": "Start with the genotype in a somatic cell prior to heat shock: one X chromosome carries the wild-type distal alleles and the other carries the mutant distal alleles, specifically\n- X Chromosome 1: [Centromere]–FRT–$y^+$–$sn^+$\n- X Chromosome 2: [Centromere]–FRT–y–sn\nThus, the cell is heterozygous for both markers (y+/y and sn+/sn) and shows a wild-type phenotype because the wild-type alleles are dominant.\n\nUpon S phase, each X chromosome replicates to form sister chromatids. A single FLP-mediated mitotic recombination event occurs at the FRT site between homologous chromatids in G2. Because both markers lie distal to the FRT, the recombination exchanges the entire distal arm containing both y/sn loci between the recombining chromatids. This produces two recombinant chromatids:\n- Recombinant R1: proximal segment from Chromosome 1 with distal y sn.\n- Recombinant R2: proximal segment from Chromosome 2 with distal $y^+$ $sn^+$.\nThe two nonrecombinant sister chromatids retain their original distal arms.\n\nThe segregation that produces a twin spot is the one in which the two recombinant chromatids segregate to different daughter cells at anaphase. In that case, each daughter receives two chromatids carrying the same distal arm:\n- One daughter cell receives both chromatids with distal y sn and becomes homozygous y/y, sn/sn. Its phenotype is yellow cuticle with singed bristles.\n- The other daughter cell receives both chromatids with distal $y^+$ $sn^+$ and becomes homozygous $y^+/y^+$, $sn^+/sn^+$. Its phenotype is wild-type.\n\nBecause both markers are distal to the same FRT site, they co-segregate in this recombination, yielding complementary homozygous clones. This is the classic twin spot: adjacent patches of homozygous mutant and homozygous wild-type tissue in a heterozygous background. Therefore, the correct description is that one cell is homozygous for the wild-type alleles and the other is homozygous for the mutant alleles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1686663"}, {"introduction": "Modern lineage tracing goes beyond simple fate mapping to test specific hypotheses about dynamic processes like tissue regeneration. By combining inducible Cre drivers with multicolor reporters, researchers can label cells at specific times and track their contributions to tissue repair. This advanced problem [@problem_id:1686726] asks you to interpret the results of such an experiment to determine whether new pancreatic beta cells arise from self-replication or from the differentiation of an unlabeled progenitor pool.", "problem": "To investigate the origin of new pancreatic beta cells during adult tissue regeneration, a team of researchers designed a transgenic mouse model, which they named the \"Beta-Tracer\" mouse. This model incorporates two key genetic components. The first component is an `Ins-CreERT2` allele, which expresses a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase specifically in insulin-producing beta cells. The second is a \"dual-reporter\" allele, which, upon Cre-mediated recombination, causes the cell and all its future progeny to permanently and stochastically express either Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) or Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), but not both.\n\nThe researchers formulated two competing hypotheses for beta cell regeneration:\n- **Hypothesis 1 (Self-Replication):** New beta cells arise primarily from the division of pre-existing, differentiated beta cells.\n- **Hypothesis 2 (Progenitor Differentiation):** New beta cells arise primarily from the differentiation of a distinct, non-beta cell progenitor population that does not express insulin.\n\nIn their experiment, adult Beta-Tracer mice were administered a single, low dose of tamoxifen to sparsely label a small fraction of existing beta cells. Immediately following this labeling event, the mice underwent a partial pancreatectomy to induce a regenerative response. After several weeks of recovery, allowing for the restoration of the pancreatic cell mass, the islets were examined using fluorescence microscopy to determine the lineage of the newly formed beta cells.\n\nWhich of the following observations, if made after the recovery period, would provide the strongest evidence in support of the Progenitor Differentiation Hypothesis?\n\nA. The regenerated islets contain distinct, multi-cell clusters of beta cells. Each cluster is uniformly composed of either all CFP-positive cells or all YFP-positive cells. Unlabeled beta cells are rare.\n\nB. The number of CFP-positive and YFP-positive beta cells has not significantly increased, and they remain as single, scattered cells. The vast majority of newly formed beta cells are unlabeled, being negative for both CFP and YFP.\n\nC. The regenerated islets contain large, multi-cell clusters where CFP-positive cells and YFP-positive cells are randomly intermingled within the same cluster.\n\nD. Following regeneration, all beta cells co-express both CFP and YFP, and the distinction between the two colors is lost.\n\nE. All beta cells in the regenerated pancreas are labeled, with roughly half being CFP-positive and half being YFP-positive, completely replacing the original unlabeled population.", "solution": "We analyze the lineage-tracing logic of the Beta-Tracer system under the two hypotheses, using the principles of Cre-loxP recombination, inducible and cell-type-specific Cre activation, and clonal permanence of a stochastic dual-color reporter.\n\nBy construction, Ins-CreERT2 is activated by tamoxifen only in insulin-expressing beta cells at the time of induction. Therefore:\n1. Only pre-existing beta cells at induction undergo Cre-mediated recombination.\n2. The dual-reporter yields a permanent, mutually exclusive, stochastic choice between CFP and YFP per recombined cell, inherited by all of its descendants. Thus, all progeny of a single recombined beta cell must display the same color.\n3. Cells that did not express insulin at induction (e.g., putative progenitors) do not recombine and therefore remain unlabeled (negative for both CFP and YFP). If these cells later differentiate into beta cells, they will still be unlabeled.\n\nPredictive consequences:\n- Under Hypothesis 1 (Self-Replication): New beta cells arise from division of labeled pre-existing beta cells. Thus, labeled clones expand, producing monochromatic clusters (each clone uniformly CFP or YFP). The fraction of labeled beta cells should increase in the regenerated tissue, and unlabeled beta cells should be relatively uncommon if regeneration is largely driven by labeled beta cells.\n- Under Hypothesis 2 (Progenitor Differentiation): New beta cells arise from unlabeled progenitors that did not express insulin at induction. Thus, most new beta cells will be unlabeled (negative for both CFP and YFP), while the sparsely labeled pre-existing beta cells will not expand substantially and will remain mostly as single, scattered labeled cells. The overall labeled beta-cell pool will not significantly increase.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Distinct, monochromatic clusters with rare unlabeled cells indicate expansion of labeled clones from pre-existing beta cells, consistent with self-replication, not progenitor differentiation.\n- B: Labeled beta cells remain sparse singletons with no significant increase, while the vast majority of new beta cells are unlabeled. This matches the prediction that new beta cells originated from unlabeled progenitors and strongly supports progenitor differentiation.\n- C: Large clusters with random intermingling of CFP and YFP within the same cluster imply polyclonal expansion from multiple labeled founders. Given sparse labeling and the clonal permanence of a single color, this requires many labeled founders contributing, which is inconsistent with progenitor differentiation and suggests extensive expansion of labeled beta cells.\n- D: Co-expression of both CFP and YFP contradicts the dual-reporter’s mutually exclusive design and is not a valid outcome; it neither supports nor refutes a regeneration mechanism but indicates a technical inconsistency.\n- E: All beta cells labeled in roughly equal CFP/YFP proportions implies near-complete derivation from labeled pre-existing beta cells or unrealistically widespread recombination, supporting self-replication and contradicting progenitor differentiation.\n\nTherefore, the observation that most new beta cells are unlabeled and previously labeled cells remain sparse singletons provides the strongest evidence for the Progenitor Differentiation Hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1686726"}]}
