This practice explores the fundamental genetic mechanism that allows a single gene to acquire a new function in a different time and place without disrupting its original role. By analyzing the hypothetical case of the *Branchiawing* ($Bw$) gene [@problem_id:1675439], you will distinguish between changes to a protein's code and changes to its regulatory instructions, a key concept in understanding the co-option of genes.", "problem": "In a newly discovered species of amphibious insect, the gene *Branchiawing* ($Bw$) is critical for development. During the aquatic larval stage, the $Bw$ gene is expressed in the thoracic segments and is essential for the formation of external gills used for respiration. After metamorphosis, in the terrestrial adult stage, the same $Bw$ gene is expressed again in the thoracic body wall and is essential for the formation of wings. Biochemical analysis confirms that the Bw protein produced in the larval gills is identical in sequence to the Bw protein produced in the adult wing primordia.\n\nWhich of the following is the most plausible and direct genetic mechanism that would allow for the re-deployment of the *Bw* gene for a new function in the adult, while preserving its original function in the larva?\n\nA. A mutation in the protein-coding sequence of the $Bw$ gene that makes the protein functional in both air and water.\n\nB. The evolution of a new *cis*-regulatory element (e.g., an enhancer) associated with the $Bw$ gene, which is responsive to transcription factors present only in the developing adult wing tissue.\n\nC. The entire $Bw$ gene was duplicated, allowing one copy to specialize for wing development while the original copy retained its gill-development function.\n\nD. A global change in the ribosomal machinery of the insect after metamorphosis, causing it to translate the $Bw$ messenger RNA (mRNA) differently in the adult.\n\nE. The $Bw$ gene evolved to be expressed in all cells at all times, but its protein product is only activated by local, tissue-specific enzymes present in either the gills or the wings.", "solution": "We are asked for the most plausible and direct genetic mechanism that allows the same gene, $Bw$, to be used in two different developmental contexts (larval gills and adult wings), with the biochemical analysis confirming that the protein sequence is identical in both contexts.\n\nCore developmental genetics principle: Spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression during development are typically controlled by modular cis-regulatory elements (e.g., enhancers, silencers, promoters) that integrate inputs from transcription factors present in specific tissues and stages. The same protein-coding sequence can be deployed in different tissues at different times by evolving new enhancers or modifying existing ones, without any change to the protein sequence.\n\nGiven observations:\n- The same $Bw$ protein sequence is produced in larval gills and adult wing primordia (no coding sequence change is implicated).\n- The gene is expressed specifically in thoracic segments during larval stage (for gills) and again in the thoracic body wall during the adult stage (for wings), indicating stage- and tissue-specific transcriptional control, not ubiquitous expression.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- Option A (coding sequence mutation): This is inconsistent with the observation that the protein sequences are identical in larval and adult tissues. If a coding mutation had enabled dual functionality, there would be a sequence change, which is not observed. Hence, A is not supported.\n- Option B (evolution of a new cis-regulatory element): This matches the established mechanism of redeployment. A new enhancer responsive to transcription factors present in adult wing tissue would drive $Bw$ expression specifically in the developing wing, while existing enhancers continue to drive expression in larval gills, preserving the original function. This is the most direct and parsimonious mechanism consistent with identical protein sequences and tissue-specific, stage-specific expression.\n- Option C (gene duplication): While gene duplication can allow subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization, it is less direct and not necessary here. The identical protein sequences do not exclude duplication, but duplication is not the most parsimonious explanation when cis-regulatory evolution suffices, and there is no evidence of two loci or copy-specific expression.\n- Option D (global ribosomal change): A global change in translation machinery would affect all mRNAs and does not explain tissue-specific expression or redeployment of a single gene in a specific adult tissue. It also does not directly create new spatial expression patterns.\n- Option E (ubiquitous expression with local activation): This contradicts the stated observation that $Bw$ is expressed in specific tissues and stages, not ubiquitously. Moreover, the mechanism proposed is less direct compared to enhancer-driven transcriptional specificity and is unsupported by the expression data.\n\nConclusion: The most plausible and direct mechanism is the evolution of a new cis-regulatory element driving adult wing-specific expression, while preserving larval gill expression via existing regulatory modules.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1675439"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of gene co-option, this problem examines how an entire signaling pathway can be reused to produce strikingly different outcomes. The same molecular signal, the hormone auxin, directs plant shoots to grow up and roots to grow down. This exercise challenges you to think beyond the signal itself and consider how the cellular context and differential sensitivity of target tissues allow for the co-option of a pathway for opposite functions [@problem_id:1675441].", "problem": "In vascular plants, the phenomenon of gravitropism dictates the direction of growth in response to gravity. Plant shoots exhibit negative gravitropism, growing upwards against the gravitational pull, while roots exhibit positive gravitropism, growing downwards with it. A central molecular player in this process is the hormone auxin, specifically Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). In a plant placed horizontally, physiological mechanisms cause auxin to accumulate to a higher concentration on the lower side of both the primary root and the main shoot. Despite this identical initial cue—a higher concentration of auxin on the lower side—the two organs bend in opposite directions.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following provides the most accurate cellular-level explanation for how the same signaling pathway can be co-opted to produce opposite growth outcomes in roots and shoots?\n\nA. Root cells and shoot cells have different concentration-dependent sensitivities to auxin; a concentration that promotes cell elongation in shoots is inhibitory to cell elongation in roots.\n\nB. Auxin binds to a completely different class of receptor proteins in roots than in shoots. The root receptor activates cell contraction, while the shoot receptor activates cell elongation.\n\nC. The statoliths (gravity-sensing organelles) in root cells are chemically modified to reverse the downstream signaling cascade, causing an inhibitory signal to be produced where an excitatory one is produced in shoots.\n\nD. In roots, a secondary hormone is released from the upper side that is a more potent promoter of cell elongation than auxin, overriding the effect of auxin on the lower side.\n\nE. The fundamental process of cell elongation is different in roots and shoots; root cells elongate by taking in water, while shoot cells elongate by synthesizing new cytoplasm, and auxin only affects the latter process.", "solution": "Gravitropism relies on gravity sensing by statocytes, relocalization of PIN auxin efflux carriers, and consequent lateral auxin redistribution so that the lower side of both the primary root and the main shoot accumulates more auxin when the organ is placed horizontally. This initial cue is shared by both organs.\n\nIn shoots, auxin perception via TIR1/AFB promotes degradation of AUX/IAA repressors, allowing ARFs to induce expression of growth-promoting targets. At the cellular level, auxin rapidly activates plasma membrane H^{+}-ATPases (for example via SAUR-mediated pathways and 14-3-3 binding), acidifies the apoplast, activates expansins, and loosens the cell wall, leading to increased water uptake and cell elongation (the acid-growth mechanism). Thus, higher auxin on the lower side of a shoot increases cell elongation there, causing the shoot to bend upward (negative gravitropism).\n\nIn roots, the same auxin signaling components are used, but root elongation cells exhibit a different dose-response: they are more sensitive to auxin, and elevated auxin concentrations fall into an inhibitory regime. High auxin in roots leads to apoplastic alkalinization (in part via reduced H^{+}-ATPase activity), altered ion fluxes and cytosolic signaling, and engagement of inhibitory transcriptional programs (including cross-talk with ethylene), collectively reducing cell elongation on the lower side. The upper side, experiencing lower auxin, remains within a permissive auxin range for elongation and thus grows faster, bending the root downward (positive gravitropism).\n\nTherefore, the same auxin gradient produces opposite curvature because root and shoot cells differ in their concentration-dependent sensitivity and downstream physiological response to auxin. This directly supports option A. Options B and C are incorrect because auxin receptors (TIR1/AFB family) and statolith function are broadly conserved rather than inverted between organs. Option D misattributes the primary curvature to a different hormone overriding auxin, which is not the main mechanism. Option E is false because both root and shoot elongation fundamentally occur by cell wall loosening and water uptake-driven expansion rather than synthesis of new cytoplasm as the primary driver.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1675441"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves from conceptual understanding to quantitative analysis, modeling a sophisticated case of co-option at the molecular level. Here, a gene for a receptor is repurposed through alternative processing to also produce a secreted inhibitor, a common theme in the evolution of signaling pathways.

The second is a truncated, secreted protein, `Kin-S`, which contains only the extracellular domain of `Kin-A` and acts as a competitive inhibitor.\n\nThe signaling pathway is activated when the receptor `Kin-A` binds an extracellular ligand, `L`, and two of these `L-Kin-A` complexes dimerize to form an active signaling complex, `(L-Kin-A)_2`.
