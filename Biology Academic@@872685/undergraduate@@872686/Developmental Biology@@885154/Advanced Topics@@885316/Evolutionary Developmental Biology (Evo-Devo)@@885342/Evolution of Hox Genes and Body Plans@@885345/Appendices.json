This first practice explores a classic 'loss-of-function' scenario involving the *Antennapedia* (*Antp*) gene. By predicting the outcome of its absence, you can deduce its normal role in specifying segmental identity and grasp the fundamental principle of homeotic transformation, where one body part is replaced by another more anterior one. [@problem_id:1685827]", "problem": "In the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the body plan is organized into segments, each with a specific identity determined by a family of master regulatory genes called Hox genes. The thorax is composed of three segments: the first thoracic segment (T1), the second thoracic segment (T2), and the third thoracic segment (T3). In a wild-type fly, T1 develops a pair of legs. T2 develops a pair of legs and a pair of wings. T3 develops a pair of legs and a pair of small balancing organs called halteres.\n\nThe *Antennapedia* (*Antp*) gene is a Hox gene whose primary function is to specify the identity of the T2 segment. Imagine a developmental biologist creates a mutant fly that has a complete loss-of-function mutation in the *Antp* gene, meaning the gene produces no functional protein.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best represents the predicted homeotic transformation in this mutant fly?\n\nA. The second thoracic segment (T2) will develop structures characteristic of the first thoracic segment (T1), resulting in a segment with legs but no wings.\n\nB. The second thoracic segment (T2) will develop structures characteristic of the third thoracic segment (T3), resulting in a segment with legs and halteres instead of wings.\n\nC. The head segment will develop a pair of legs in place of the antennae.\n\nD. The second thoracic segment (T2) will fail to develop entirely, and will be absent from the adult fly.\n\nE. Both the second (T2) and third (T3) thoracic segments will develop wings, resulting in a four-winged fly.", "solution": "We use the general principles of Hox gene function and homeotic transformation:\n1) Hox genes specify segmental identity along the anterior-posterior axis. \n2) Loss-of-function of a Hox gene typically causes a homeotic transformation toward a more anterior identity (anteriorization) of the affected segment, not loss of the segment.\n3) Gain-of-function or ectopic expression of a Hox gene can impose a more posterior identity in an anterior region.\n\nApply to the specific case:\n4) The Antennapedia (Antp) gene normally specifies the identity of the second thoracic segment (T2).\n5) A complete loss-of-function mutation in Antp removes T2 identity cues, so the default transformation is toward the identity of the next more anterior segment, which is T1.\n6) The characteristic structures are: T1 has legs only; T2 has legs and wings; T3 has legs and halteres.\n\nPredicted phenotype:\n7) With Antp nonfunctional, the T2 segment assumes T1 identity, yielding a segment with legs but no wings. This matches option A.\n\nExclude other options:\n8) Option B (T2 acquiring T3 identity) would be a posteriorization, not expected from Antp loss-of-function; T3 identity is normally specified by Ultrabithorax (Ubx).\n9) Option C (legs replacing antennae) is the classic Antp gain-of-function in the head, not a loss-of-function in T2.\n10) Option D (segment absence) is not typical of Hox loss-of-function; segments are transformed, not eliminated.\n11) Option E (four-winged fly) is produced by Ubx loss-of-function causing T3 to transform into T2, not by Antp loss-of-function.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that T2 becomes T1-like: legs without wings.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1685827"}, {"introduction": "While removing a gene is revealing, so is activating it in an abnormal location. This exercise examines a 'gain-of-function' mutation, the conceptual opposite of the previous problem. You'll explore the consequences of ectopically expressing the leg-promoting *Antennapedia* gene in the head, a hypothetical scenario that mirrors a famous real-world discovery and highlights the power of Hox genes as master developmental switches. [@problem_id:1961325]", "problem": "In the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, a group of genes known as Homeobox (Hox) genes are critical for establishing the identity of body segments along the anterior-posterior axis. Each Hox gene is typically expressed in a specific region of the developing embryo and instructs the cells in that region to form the structures appropriate for that segment.\n\nConsider the *Antennapedia* (Antp) gene, a Hox gene whose primary function is to promote the development of legs on the second thoracic segment. A geneticist discovers a specific type of mutation, known as a gain-of-function mutation, in the *Antennapedia* gene. This mutation causes the Antp protein to be ectopically expressed (i.e., expressed in an abnormal location) in the cells of the head segment that would normally give rise to antennae.\n\nGiven the established role of the *Antennapedia* gene, what is the most likely morphological phenotype that would be observed in an adult fly carrying this specific gain-of-function mutation?\n\nA. A pair of antennae will grow from the second thoracic segment in place of the middle pair of legs.\n\nB. A pair of legs will grow from the head in place of the antennae.\n\nC. The insect will develop a second pair of wings on its head.\n\nD. The insect will be non-viable because the head will fail to develop entirely.", "solution": "Hox genes are a family of master regulatory genes that determine the identity of body segments during embryonic development. They encode transcription factors that control the expression of a cascade of downstream genes, thereby orchestrating the formation of segment-specific structures like limbs, wings, or antennae. A change in the expression pattern of a Hox gene can lead to a homeotic transformation, where one body part is replaced by another.\n\nThe problem describes a gain-of-function mutation in the *Antennapedia* (Antp) gene of *Drosophila*. The normal function of the Antp gene is to specify the identity of the second thoracic segment (T2). The principal appendages of the T2 segment are the middle pair of legs. Therefore, the developmental command issued by the Antp protein can be understood as \"differentiate into a T2-segment structure,\" which for the appendage primordia means \"build a leg.\"\n\nThe mutation causes this \"build a leg\" command to be ectopically expressed in the head segment, specifically in the group of cells (the imaginal disc) that are fated to become antennae. The presence of the Antp protein in these cells overrides their normal developmental program. Instead of following the default pathway to form an antenna, the cells execute the newly supplied instruction from Antp. As a result, a leg structure will develop where an antenna should have been.\n\nWe can analyze the options based on this principle:\n\nOption A states that antennae will grow from the thorax. This describes the phenotype expected from a loss-of-function mutation in the *Antennapedia* gene. If the Antp gene were inactivated in the thorax, the T2 segment might adopt a more anterior or 'default' identity, which in this context would be that of the head, leading to antennae forming instead of legs. This is the opposite of the gain-of-function scenario described.\n\nOption B states that legs will grow from the head. This is the correct prediction. The gain of *Antennapedia* function in the head imposes a thoracic (leg-bearing) identity upon the antennal precursor cells, causing them to develop into legs. This is the classic *Antennapedia* homeotic phenotype.\n\nOption C suggests that wings will develop on the head. This is incorrect. Although the second thoracic segment (specified by Antp) is the wing-bearing segment in *Drosophila*, the Hox gene's role in specifying appendage identity is more directly linked to the leg. The transformation of an appendage like an antenna is almost always into another homologous appendage, like a leg, not a fundamentally different structure like a wing, which arises from the dorsal body wall.\n\nOption D suggests the fly would be non-viable due to a failure of head development. This is also incorrect. Homeotic mutations typically cause transformations of identity, not the complete absence or death of a segment. The cells in the head are still viable and capable of differentiating; they just form a structure that is inappropriate for that location. While such a fly might have reduced fitness (e.g., difficulty feeding or sensing), it is generally viable into adulthood.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a homeotic transformation of antennae into legs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1961325"}, {"introduction": "The dramatic transformations seen in homeotic mutants often arise not from changes to the Hox protein itself, but from errors in its regulation. This final practice moves from the 'what' to the 'how,' focusing on the molecular machinery that controls where and when a gene is active. By analyzing a mutation within a gene's enhancer region, you will see how a single DNA base change can alter the binding of a regulatory protein and cause the misexpression of a powerful gene like *Antennapedia*. [@problem_id:1685883]", "problem": "In a species of fruit fly, the *Antennapedia* (*Antp*) gene is a homeotic (Hox) gene responsible for specifying the identity of the second thoracic segment, where a pair of legs develops. The expression of the *Antp* gene is tightly controlled by various cis-regulatory elements, including enhancer sequences. In wild-type flies, *Antp* is expressed in the thoracic segments but is actively repressed in the head segments, allowing antennae to develop normally.\n\nConsider a specific enhancer for the *Antp* gene. This enhancer contains binding sites for a thoracic-specific activator protein, which promotes *Antp* expression, and a head-specific repressor protein, which silences *Antp* expression. A biologist discovers a mutant fly that exhibits the classic \"antennapedia\" phenotype: legs are growing out of the head in place of antennae. Genetic sequencing reveals that this phenotype is caused by a single point mutation within this specific *Antp* enhancer.\n\nAssuming all other genes and proteins, including the *Antp* protein itself and all regulatory proteins (activators and repressors), are normal, which of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular explanation for the observed mutant phenotype?\n\nA. The point mutation strengthens the binding affinity of the head-specific repressor protein, causing it to act as an activator.\n\nB. The point mutation creates a new binding site for a ubiquitous activator protein that is present in all cells, including the head.\n\nC. The point mutation disrupts the binding site for the thoracic-specific activator protein, preventing it from binding.\n\nD. The point mutation disrupts the binding site for the head-specific repressor protein, preventing it from binding.\n\nE. The point mutation alters the DNA sequence within the *Antp* protein-coding region, leading to the production of a hyperactive *Antp* protein.", "solution": "We apply principles of cis-regulatory control of gene expression. An enhancer integrates inputs from activators and repressors to determine spatial expression. In wild-type, the *Antp* enhancer has a thoracic-specific activator site that drives expression in thorax and a head-specific repressor site that silences expression in head. Ectopic *Antp* expression in the head is sufficient to convert antennae into legs (the Antennapedia phenotype), so we seek a mutation that causes *Antp* to be expressed in the head while all trans factors (activators and repressors) are normal.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Strengthening the binding affinity of a head-specific repressor would not convert it into an activator. Activator versus repressor function depends on protein domains and cofactor recruitment, not simply binding affinity. This is not a plausible mechanism.\n\nB. Creating a new binding site for a ubiquitous activator could, in principle, increase enhancer activity broadly. However, the head-specific repressor remains intact and present in head cells; a functioning repressor binding to its site typically silences enhancer output in that domain. Thus, adding an activator site would not reliably overcome repression in the head, and it would also be expected to induce broader misexpression beyond the head, which is not described. This is less parsimonious than removing the head-specific repression.\n\nC. Disrupting the thoracic-specific activator site would reduce or eliminate *Antp* expression in thorax, tending to impair leg development in thoracic segments, not cause legs to form in the head. This contradicts the observed phenotype.\n\nD. Disrupting the head-specific repressor binding site prevents the repressor from binding in head cells. With repression relieved, the enhancer can become active in the head (via basal transcriptional machinery and any non-head-restricted activators or general factors), producing ectopic *Antp* expression in the head and thereby causing antenna-to-leg transformation. This is the canonical and most direct explanation for head-specific derepression leading to the Antennapedia phenotype, consistent with the mutation being confined to the enhancer and all regulatory proteins being normal.\n\nE. This contradicts the stipulated finding that the causal mutation lies within the enhancer, not the coding region.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible molecular explanation is the loss of the head-specific repressor binding site in the enhancer, preventing repression in the head and allowing ectopic *Antp* expression there.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1685883"}]}
