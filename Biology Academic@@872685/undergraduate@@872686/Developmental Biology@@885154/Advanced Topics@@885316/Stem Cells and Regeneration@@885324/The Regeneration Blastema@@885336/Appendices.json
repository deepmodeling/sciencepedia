{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the most fundamental questions in regeneration biology is the origin of blastema cells. This exercise challenges you to think like an experimentalist, interpreting the results of a hypothetical cell-labeling study to find evidence that distinguishes between the de-differentiation and resident stem cell hypotheses [@problem_id:1726374]. Understanding how to interpret such data is a core skill in developmental biology.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the cellular source of the regeneration blastema, a mass of undifferentiated cells that forms at an amputation site, in a salamander. Two primary hypotheses are under consideration:\n\n1.  **The De-differentiation Hypothesis**: This proposes that mature, differentiated cells near the wound (such as muscle cells, cartilage cells, and fibroblasts) first lose their specialized features, then re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate to form the blastema.\n2.  **The Resident Stem Cell Hypothesis**: This posits that a pre-existing population of quiescent (non-dividing) adult stem cells, located within the limb tissues, is activated by the injury. These activated stem cells then proliferate and differentiate to regenerate the lost structures.\n\nTo distinguish between these two models, the biologist performs the following experiment. A salamander's forelimb is amputated. After a few days, allowing an early blastema to form, the animal is given a single injection of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU is a synthetic analog of thymidine that is specifically incorporated into newly synthesized DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Two hours after the injection, the regenerating limb tip is harvested, fixed, sectioned, and subjected to immunofluorescence using a fluorescently labeled antibody that specifically binds to BrdU. The sections are then examined under a microscope.\n\nWhich of the following potential observations would provide the strongest evidence in favor of the **De-differentiation Hypothesis**?\n\nA. A high percentage of the undifferentiated cells within the blastema are BrdU-positive, while all recognizable differentiated cells in the adjacent stump tissue are BrdU-negative.\n\nB. BrdU-positive cells are found exclusively in a small, well-defined cluster of cells within the stump tissue, but not in the blastema itself, suggesting a localized stem cell niche.\n\nC. BrdU-positive nuclei are observed within cells that still retain some identifiable differentiated features (e.g., cells within the sheath of a muscle fiber or periosteal cells on bone surfaces) at the interface between the stump and the blastema.\n\nD. No cells are BrdU-positive, indicating that blastema growth is primarily due to the migration of existing cells, not their proliferation.\n\nE. All cells throughout the animal's body, including those in tissues far from the injury site, show uniform BrdU incorporation.", "solution": "Step 1: Interpret the experimental marker and timing. BrdU is incorporated only into DNA of cells that are in S-phase during the short window after injection. With a single BrdU pulse and a two-hour chase before fixation, BrdU-positive nuclei mark cells that have entered S-phase in that defined interval. Therefore, BrdU-positive cells are those actively re-entering or continuing the cell cycle at the time of sampling.\n\nStep 2: Map predicted labeling patterns to each hypothesis.\n- De-differentiation Hypothesis predicts that mature differentiated cells near the wound will lose specialized features and re-enter the cell cycle. During the transitional period, some cells may still display residual differentiated features (e.g., position within a muscle fiber sheath or periosteum) while entering S-phase. Thus, BrdU-positive nuclei within cells that retain identifiable differentiated characteristics at the stump–blastema interface would be direct evidence that differentiated cells are re-entering the cycle and contributing to the blastema.\n- Resident Stem Cell Hypothesis predicts activation of quiescent adult stem cells. BrdU labeling would be expected in undifferentiated cells originating from a niche, potentially appearing as a localized cluster in stump tissue or distributed within the blastema, while mature differentiated cells in the stump would remain BrdU-negative.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option against these predictions.\n- Option A: High BrdU in the blastema and BrdU-negative differentiated stump cells indicates proliferation within undifferentiated blastema cells and no evidence of differentiated cells re-entering S-phase. This pattern is compatible with the resident stem cell model and is not specific evidence for de-differentiation.\n- Option B: A small, well-defined BrdU-positive cluster in the stump but not in the blastema suggests a localized stem cell niche, directly supporting the resident stem cell hypothesis.\n- Option C: BrdU-positive nuclei within cells that still show identifiable differentiated features at the stump–blastema interface indicates that differentiated cells are entering S-phase during the labeling window. This directly supports the de-differentiation hypothesis by capturing cells in transition from a differentiated to a proliferative, blastema-contributing state.\n- Option D: No BrdU-positive cells suggests little to no proliferation and argues for migration rather than proliferation, which contradicts the known proliferative nature of blastema growth; it does not support either model.\n- Option E: Uniform BrdU labeling throughout the body indicates a methodological artifact or systemic effect unrelated to local regeneration mechanisms and is non-informative with respect to the hypotheses.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion. The observation that most strongly supports de-differentiation is BrdU incorporation in cells that retain differentiated characteristics at the stump–blastema interface, i.e., Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1726374"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of de-differentiation, we can ask more specifically about the fate of individual cell types. This problem utilizes a powerful technique known as lineage tracing to follow muscle cells after amputation [@problem_id:1726323]. By predicting the outcome, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the remarkable cellular plasticity that underlies blastema formation.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating limb regeneration in the axolotl salamander, a model organism renowned for this ability. Using a sophisticated genetic technique, the researcher permanently labels the nuclei of all mature muscle cells (myocytes) in an adult axolotl's forelimb with a stable green fluorescent protein (GFP). This lineage tracing marker ensures that any cell descending from an original muscle cell will also carry the green fluorescent label.\n\nFollowing the labeling procedure, the researcher amputates the limb at the mid-forearm. Over the next few weeks, a structure known as the regeneration blastema forms at the amputation site. The blastema is a mound of morphologically uniform, actively proliferating cells that will ultimately grow and redifferentiate to form all the tissues of the lost limb, including skeleton, connective tissue, skin, and muscle.\n\nThe researcher then takes a thin cross-section of the fully formed, but still largely undifferentiated, blastema and examines it with a fluorescence microscope. Based on the established principles of urodele amphibian regeneration, which of the following observations is the most likely outcome?\n\nA. The blastema is entirely devoid of green fluorescent cells. The original labeled muscle cells remain confined to the stump, proximal to the plane of amputation.\n\nB. Green fluorescent cells are found, but only within isolated pockets of the blastema that are destined to form the new limb's musculature.\n\nC. Green fluorescent cells are found scattered throughout the mesenchymal mass of the blastema, intermingled with unlabeled cells. These fluorescent cells lack the characteristic elongated shape of mature muscle and appear undifferentiated.\n\nD. A high concentration of green fluorescent cells is observed, but they are all undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death) at the boundary between the stump and the blastema.\n\nE. The green fluorescent cells have migrated to form a single, distinct layer directly beneath the apical epidermal cap (the specialized epidermis covering the blastema).", "solution": "The lineage-tracing label is heritable; therefore any progeny produced by labeled mature muscle cells will retain green fluorescence. In urodele limb regeneration, differentiated stump tissues, including skeletal muscle, contribute cells to the blastema by producing proliferative progenitors that lack the morphology of mature tissue. These blastemal cells are morphologically uniform, mesenchymal, and intermingled; they initially appear undifferentiated and only later redifferentiate according to positional cues. Although muscle-derived blastema cells are generally lineage-restricted to form muscle upon redifferentiation, at the undifferentiated blastema stage they are not segregated into discrete “muscle-only” pockets and do not form a single layer beneath the apical epidermal cap. Apoptosis is not the predominant fate of muscle-derived cells at the stump–blastema interface.\n\nGiven these principles:\n- Option A is unlikely because muscle-derived cells do contribute to the blastema rather than remaining entirely within the stump.\n- Option B is unlikely because, at the undifferentiated blastema stage, muscle-derived progenitors are intermingled rather than confined to isolated muscle-destined pockets.\n- Option C matches the expected outcome: green fluorescent cells from muscle are scattered throughout the blastema mesenchyme, appear undifferentiated, and intermingle with unlabeled cells derived from other lineages.\n- Option D is inconsistent with the proliferative, not apoptotic, nature of blastema formation.\n- Option E is incorrect because there is no single, distinct layer of muscle-derived cells beneath the apical epidermal cap; that region is occupied by the specialized epidermis and subjacent mesenchyme of mixed lineage.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is described by Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1726323"}, {"introduction": "Forming a blastema is only the first step; these cells must then be patterned to reconstruct a complex, three-dimensional structure. This practice explores what happens when this patterning goes awry, asking you to diagnose the cause of a specific defect in a regenerated limb [@problem_id:1726330]. This requires linking the final anatomy back to the fundamental coordinate systems, or axes, that operate within the developing blastema.", "problem": "An experiment is conducted on an axolotl (*Ambystoma mexicanum*) to study the mechanisms of limb regeneration. A forelimb is amputated just distal to the elbow, allowing for the formation of a regeneration blastema, which is a mass of undifferentiated cells that will reconstruct the lost portion of the limb. The regeneration process is allowed to proceed to completion.\n\nUpon inspection of the fully regenerated structure, it is observed that while the limb has grown to the correct length (indicating successful proximo-distal outgrowth), the autopod (the \"hand\" region) is malformed. Instead of the normal set of distinct digits, the axolotl has regenerated a single, large, central digit. This solitary digit appears morphologically symmetrical.\n\nBased on this specific developmental outcome, the failure to form multiple, distinct digits is most directly attributed to a primary defect in the establishment of which one of the following developmental axes within the blastema?\n\nA. Proximo-distal (P-D) axis\n\nB. Antero-posterior (A-P) axis\n\nC. Dorso-ventral (D-V) axis\n\nD. Mediolateral (M-L) axis\n\nE. Left-right (L-R) axis", "solution": "We first interpret the phenotypic observations relative to the three canonical axes that pattern a vertebrate limb: proximo-distal (P-D), antero-posterior (A-P), and dorso-ventral (D-V).\n\n1) The limb has grown to the correct length. Correct overall outgrowth and appropriate formation of the stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod length indicate that P-D patterning and growth signaling (e.g., via the apical ectodermal ridge and associated fibroblast growth factor signaling) are intact. Therefore, a primary defect in the P-D axis (choice A) is unlikely.\n\n2) The autopod is malformed, displaying a single, large, central digit that is morphologically symmetrical. The number and identity of digits are patterned along the A-P axis (thumb = anterior; little finger = posterior), classically governed by a posterior mesenchymal signaling center, the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), which produces Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Proper A-P patterning requires an Shh gradient across the anterior-posterior extent of the limb bud or blastema. When A-P signaling is lost or fails to be established, the limb fails to specify distinct digit identities and can collapse to a single digit, often resembling the most anterior digit, and may appear symmetrical due to the absence of an A-P gradient. Therefore, a failure to establish the A-P axis (choice B) most directly explains the phenotype of a solitary, central, symmetric digit.\n\n3) The D-V axis governs dorsal versus ventral characteristics (e.g., nail vs. pad) and is controlled by signals such as Wnt7a from dorsal ectoderm and En1 ventrally. D-V defects generate dorsalization or ventralization, not loss of digit number into a single central digit. Thus, D-V (choice C) is not consistent with the observed failure to form multiple distinct digits.\n\n4) Mediolateral (M-L) is not a canonical intrinsic patterning axis for vertebrate limb morphogenesis; limb axes are P-D, A-P, and D-V. A choice of M-L (choice D) does not correspond to the established limb patterning framework.\n\n5) Left-right (L-R) is a whole-body axis determining organ laterality; it does not directly specify digit number within a single limb. Therefore, L-R (choice E) is not appropriate.\n\nGiven that correct length rules out a P-D defect and the specific failure to produce multiple, distinct digits is a hallmark of impaired A-P patterning, the primary defect is in the antero-posterior axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1726330"}]}
