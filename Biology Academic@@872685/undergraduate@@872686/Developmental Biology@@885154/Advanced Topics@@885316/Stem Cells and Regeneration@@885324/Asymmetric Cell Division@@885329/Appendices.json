{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before delving into the molecular machinery of asymmetric cell division, it is essential to grasp its fundamental purpose at the tissue level. The balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is critical for maintaining tissue size and function, a state known as homeostasis. This first exercise [@problem_id:1672107] invites you to consider the direct consequences of a stem cell's division choice—asymmetric versus symmetric—on the overall stem cell population.", "problem": "In many adult tissues, a population of stem cells is responsible for tissue maintenance and repair. A fundamental behavior of these cells is their mode of division. A stem cell can undergo an asymmetric division, where it produces one daughter cell identical to itself (a stem cell) and one daughter cell that will proceed along a differentiation pathway. This process maintains the stem cell pool at a constant size, a state known as homeostasis.\n\nAlternatively, a stem cell can undergo a symmetric division, where both daughter cells adopt the same fate—either both become stem cells or both commit to differentiation.\n\nConsider a single adult stem cell in a tissue niche that normally divides asymmetrically. Suppose that due to a transient signaling error, this single stem cell undergoes one, and only one, symmetric division. What are the two distinct and possible outcomes for the change in the total number of stem cells within that niche immediately following this single event?\n\nSelect the option that correctly describes these two alternative outcomes.\n\nA. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche increases by one. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche remains the same.\n\nB. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche remains the same. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by one.\n\nC. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche increases by one. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by one.\n\nD. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche increases by two. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by two.\n\nE. Outcome 1: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by one. Outcome 2: The number of stem cells in the niche decreases by two.", "solution": "Let the initial number of stem cells in the niche be $N$. Under normal asymmetric division, a stem cell produces one stem cell and one differentiating cell, so the stem cell count remains $N$.\n\nWith a single symmetric division event, there are two distinct possibilities:\n\n1. Symmetric self-renewal: the one stem cell produces two stem cells. The new stem cell count is $N+1$, a change of $+1$.\n\n2. Symmetric differentiation: the one stem cell produces two differentiating cells (no stem cells). The new stem cell count is $N-1$, a change of $-1$.\n\nTherefore, the two possible immediate outcomes for the total number of stem cells are an increase by one or a decrease by one, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1672107"}, {"introduction": "Achieving an asymmetric outcome requires precise spatial control. Cells often rely on external signals from their surrounding environment, or \"niche,\" to orchestrate this process. This practice problem [@problem_id:1672114] presents a classic scenario where a stem cell's fate is governed by its physical contact with a niche cell. By exploring the consequences of altering the mitotic spindle's orientation relative to this external cue, you can develop an intuitive understanding of how cellular geometry and extrinsic signals collaborate to determine daughter cell fates.", "problem": "In a developing tissue, a population of stem cells is maintained by its physical contact with a specialized 'niche' cell. This contact provides a localized signal to the stem cell. In response to this signal, a set of cell fate determinants, which we will call 'Stem Factors', accumulate on the inner side of the stem cell's plasma membrane specifically at the point of contact with the niche.\n\nDuring a normal, asymmetric division, the stem cell orients its mitotic spindle perpendicular to the niche-contact surface. The cell then divides along a cleavage plane that is perpendicular to the spindle's main axis. This process results in one daughter cell that remains in contact with the niche and inherits all the Stem Factors (becoming a new stem cell), while the other daughter cell is displaced from the niche and inherits no Stem Factors (and subsequently differentiates).\n\nNow, consider a scenario where a specific mutation causes the dividing stem cell to orient its mitotic spindle *parallel* to the niche-contact surface. Assuming the cell division process completes and the cleavage plane still forms perpendicular to the spindle's main axis, what is the most probable outcome for the two daughter cells?\n\nA. Both daughter cells will fail to receive the niche signal and will differentiate.\n\nB. Both daughter cells will inherit Stem Factors and niche contact, and both will become stem cells.\n\nC. One daughter cell will become a stem cell, and the other will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\nD. The division will be identical to the normal outcome, with one stem cell and one differentiating cell.\n\nE. Both daughter cells will be pushed out of the niche, and a new stem cell will be recruited from elsewhere.", "solution": "Define the niche-contact surface as a plane $S$ and the spindle main axis as a vector $\\vec{s}$. The cleavage plane $P$ is always perpendicular to the spindle axis, so $P \\perp \\vec{s}$.\n\nNormal division:\n1. Given $\\vec{s} \\perp S$, it follows that $P \\parallel S$.\n2. The Stem Factors are localized to the inner membrane at the niche-contact region on $S$.\n3. With $P \\parallel S$, the cleavage plane separates the cell into a daughter adjacent to $S$ and a daughter displaced away from $S$.\n4. Consequently, the daughter adjacent to $S$ inherits the entire polarized cortical domain containing the Stem Factors and maintains niche contact, becoming a stem cell; the displaced daughter inherits none and differentiates.\n\nMutant division (spindle parallel to $S$):\n1. Given $\\vec{s} \\parallel S$, it follows that $P \\perp S$.\n2. With $P \\perp S$, the cleavage plane intersects the niche-contact surface $S$ and partitions the cortical domain at $S$.\n3. Therefore, each daughter cell inherits a portion of the niche-contacting membrane and, with it, a portion of the localized Stem Factors.\n4. Because both daughters retain contact with the niche and both inherit Stem Factors, both daughters receive the self-renewal signal.\n5. The most probable outcome is a symmetric division yielding two stem cells.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that both daughter cells will inherit Stem Factors and niche contact and both will become stem cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1672114"}, {"introduction": "While external cues are crucial, cells can also generate asymmetry through purely internal mechanisms. This involves the pre-localization and subsequent segregation of specific molecules, known as intrinsic cell fate determinants, into only one of the two daughter cells. This exercise [@problem_id:1672144] models such a system using a hypothetical determinant protein. It challenges you to predict the outcome when the machinery responsible for anchoring this determinant fails, providing a clear illustration of how the correct partitioning of internal factors is essential for creating cellular diversity.", "problem": "In the early development of a hypothetical invertebrate, *Caenorhabditis simplicius*, a specific lineage of neuroblast stem cells (NSCs) is crucial for forming the central nervous system. A single NSC divides asymmetrically to produce two distinct daughter cells: a new NSC that retains its self-renewing properties and a ganglion mother cell (GMC) that is committed to terminal differentiation into a neuron.\n\nThis asymmetric outcome is controlled by a single cell fate determinant protein, \"Nerve Inducer\" (NIN). Before mitosis, NIN protein is actively transported and anchored to one pole of the NSC's cortex. The mitotic spindle orients itself such that the subsequent cell division plane segregates all of the NIN protein into the cytoplasm of the future GMC, while the new NSC inherits none. The presence of NIN in the cytoplasm is both necessary and sufficient to activate the full genetic program for neuronal differentiation and simultaneously repress the genes responsible for stem cell self-renewal.\n\nConsider a scenario where a loss-of-function mutation occurs in a gene encoding a cortical anchor protein. This mutation prevents NIN from binding to the cell cortex, causing it to be distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm of the parent NSC before division. Assuming the process of cytokinesis (the physical division of the cell) proceeds normally, what is the most probable immediate fate of the two daughter cells produced by this mutant NSC?\n\nA. Both daughter cells will initiate the neuronal differentiation program.\n\nB. Both daughter cells will remain as neuroblast stem cells.\n\nC. One daughter cell will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), while the other will differentiate into a neuron.\n\nD. The parent cell will be unable to complete cytokinesis, resulting in a single, large cell with a duplicated genome.", "solution": "The problem states that the determinant protein NIN is both necessary and sufficient for neuronal differentiation and represses stem cell self-renewal whenever it is present in the cytoplasm. In the wild-type asymmetric division, all NIN is segregated into the GMC, and the renewed NSC receives none.\n\nDefine the total NIN content before division as $N>0$, and the cell volume as $V$. In the mutant, the loss of cortical anchoring leads to uniform cytoplasmic distribution, so the pre-division concentration is $c=\\frac{N}{V}$. During cytokinesis, with NIN uniformly distributed, partitioning into the two daughters depends only on the volume fractions they inherit. Let the two daughters inherit fractions $\\alpha$ and $1-\\alpha$ of the parent cytoplasm, with $0<\\alpha<1$. Then the NIN amounts in the daughters are\n$$\nN_{1}=\\alpha N,\\qquad N_{2}=(1-\\alpha)N.\n$$\nBecause $N>0$ and $0<\\alpha<1$, both $N_{1}>0$ and $N_{2}>0$. Given the stated biology—presence of NIN in the cytoplasm is sufficient to activate neuronal differentiation and repress self-renewal—each daughter with $N_{i}>0$ will initiate the neuronal differentiation program.\n\nOption B would require $N_{1}=N_{2}=0$, which contradicts $N>0$ and uniform distribution. Option C is not supported, as no apoptotic trigger is described; the determinant directs fate, not cell death. Option D is excluded by the problem’s assumption that cytokinesis proceeds normally.\n\nTherefore, both daughters will initiate neuronal differentiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1672144"}]}
