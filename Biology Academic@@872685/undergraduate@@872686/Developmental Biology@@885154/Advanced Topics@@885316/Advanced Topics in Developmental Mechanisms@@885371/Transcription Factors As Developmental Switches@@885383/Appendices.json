The affinity of a transcription factor for its target enhancer, quantified by the dissociation constant ($K_d$), determines the level of gene activation. This exercise explores how a single mutation can dramatically alter these affinities, effectively reprogramming a transcription factor to regulate a new set of genes and trigger a major change in developmental fate, such as a homeotic transformation. By calculating the change in enhancer occupancy, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how these molecular switches operate [@problem_id:1730921].", "problem": "In the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the *Antennapedia* (Antp) gene encodes a transcription factor essential for specifying thoracic identity, leading to the development of legs. A specific class of mutations in *Antp* can lead to a homeotic transformation, where appendages in the head develop as legs instead of antennae.\n\nConsider a hypothetical point mutation within the DNA-binding homeodomain of the Antp protein. This mutation creates a mutant protein, `Antp-mut`, which now has an altered affinity for its DNA targets. In the developing head tissue of these mutant flies, `Antp-mut` is present at a constant nuclear concentration of 20.0 nM.\n\nThe function of Antp is dictated by its binding to specific enhancer DNA sequences. We are interested in two such sequences:\n1.  `E_leg`: The canonical enhancer for genes that execute the leg development program.\n2.  `E_ant`: An enhancer for a key gene that drives the antenna development program.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constants ($K_d$), which measure the binding affinity (a lower $K_d$ signifies stronger binding), have been determined for both the wild-type (`Antp-WT`) and mutant (`Antp-mut`) proteins.\n- $K_d$ for `Antp-WT` binding to `E_leg`: 10.0 nM\n- $K_d$ for `Antp-WT` binding to `E_ant`: 800 nM\n- $K_d$ for `Antp-mut` binding to `E_leg`: 25.0 nM\n- $K_d$ for `Antp-mut` binding to `E_ant`: 5.00 nM\n\nTo quantify the molecular basis of the developmental switch caused by the mutation, calculate the ratio of the fractional occupancy of the antenna enhancer to the fractional occupancy of the leg enhancer by the mutant protein. Specifically, compute the value of $\\frac{\\theta_{\\text{ant}}}{\\theta_{\\text{leg}}}$, where $\\theta_{\\text{ant}}$ is the fraction of `E_ant` sites bound by `Antp-mut`, and $\\theta_{\\text{leg}}$ is the fraction of `E_leg` sites bound by `Antp-mut`.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "We consider equilibrium binding between a DNA site $D$ and the protein $P$ (Antp-mut), with reaction $D + P \\rightleftharpoons DP$.

These networks use simple logical motifs, like cascades of repression, to execute sophisticated developmental programs. This problem challenges you to trace the logic of a 'double-negative' regulatory circuit, where one repressor inhibits another repressor. By predicting the outcome of a mutation in this pathway, you will practice the logical deduction that is central to understanding how genetic networks control cell fate and morphology [@problem_id:1730907].", "problem": "In the developmental pathway that determines wing color in the fictional silken moth, *Sericaria splendens*, a simple gene regulatory network is at play. The wild-type moth has red wings due to a pigment produced by an enzyme encoded by the `Pigment-synthase` gene. The expression of these genes is controlled by two transcription factors, encoded by the `Red-activator` gene and the `White-keeper` gene.\n\nThe regulatory logic is as follows:\n1.  The protein product of the `Red-activator` gene functions as a transcriptional repressor for the `White-keeper` gene.\n2.  The protein product of the `White-keeper` gene functions as a transcriptional repressor for the `Pigment-synthase` gene.\n\nIn wild-type moths, the `Red-activator` gene is expressed in the cells that will form the wings.\n\nA researcher isolates a mutant strain of *S. splendens* that has a loss-of-function mutation in the `White-keeper` gene. This mutation results in the production of a non-functional White-keeper protein that cannot bind to DNA.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly predicts the wing color phenotype of the mutant moth and the underlying reason?\n\nA. The moth will be white, because the Red-activator protein requires a functional White-keeper protein to indirectly activate the pigment pathway.\n\nB. The moth will be white, because a non-functional component in the pathway will default the system to an unpigmented state.\n\nC. The moth will be red, because the repression on the `Pigment-synthase` gene is lifted.\n\nD. The moth will be red, but only in patches, because the regulatory network has become unstable.\n\nE. The phenotype will be identical to the wild-type, with no change in the expression level of the `Pigment-synthase` gene, because the `Red-activator` gene is unaffected.", "solution": "Define variables for clarity: let $R$ denote the activity of the Red-activator protein, $W$ denote the functional activity of the White-keeper protein (specifically its DNA-binding, repressive function), and $P$ denote the expression level of the Pigment-synthase gene.\n\nThe regulatory logic is:\n- $R$ represses $W$. Thus, when $R$ is present, the functional repressive activity $W$ decreases.\n- $W$ represses $P$. Thus, when $W$ is present and functional, $P$ decreases; when $W$ is absent or non-functional, $P$ increases.\n\nIn wild type wing cells, $R$ is expressed. Therefore:\n- $R$ high implies $W$ is repressed (low functional activity).\n- With $W$ low, repression on $P$ is lifted, so $P$ is expressed, leading to red pigment production and red wings. This is a double-negative logic resulting in effective activation of $P$ by $R$.\n\nIn the mutant with a loss-of-function in the White-keeper gene, the White-keeper protein is non-functional and cannot bind DNA. Therefore:\n- Regardless of $R$, the effective $W$ is functionally zero with respect to repression.\n- With $W$ non-functional, repression on $P$ is removed, so $P$ is expressed.\n- Consequently, pigment is produced and the wings are red. This remains true even if $R$ were not present; with $W$ non-functional, $P$ is derepressed.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because $R$ does not require $W$ to activate pigment; $R$ normally activates $P$ indirectly by repressing a repressor. If $W$ is non-functional, $P$ is expressed without needing $R$.\n- Option B is incorrect because the default in the absence of a functional repressor of $P$ is not white; it is derepression of $P$ and thus pigment (red).\n- Option C is correct: with $W$ non-functional, repression on $P$ is lifted, leading to red wings.\n- Option D is unsupported; there is no basis for instability or patchiness given the described deterministic repressive interactions.\n- Option E is incorrect in reasoning. Although the phenotype may match wild type (red), the stated reason is wrong: the key causal change is the loss of repression by $W$, not the unaffected status of $R$, and the expression level of $P$ is expected to be at least as high and is governed by the removal of $W$ repression.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the moth will be red because repression on the Pigment-synthase gene is lifted.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1730907"}, {"introduction": "The very first decisions in an embryo's life, such as establishing the primary body axes, are often orchestrated by transcription factors and other molecules deposited into the egg by the mother. These 'maternal effect' genes have a unique inheritance pattern, as an embryo's phenotype is determined by its mother's genotype, not its own. This practice integrates this crucial developmental concept with classical genetics, asking you to track the inheritance of a maternal effect gene through a multi-generational cross to predict the proportion of affected offspring [@problem_id:1730910].", "problem": "In the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the initial establishment of the dorsal-ventral body axis in the embryo is dictated by a concentration gradient of the nuclear-localized transcription factor Dorsal. The gene encoding this protein, *Dorsal* (`dl`), is a crucial maternal effect gene. This means that the phenotype of the embryo is determined by the genotype of its mother, not its own genotype, because the mother provisions the egg with the necessary gene products before fertilization. A mother with a homozygous null mutation for this gene (`dl/dl`) produces embryos that are \"fully dorsalized,\" meaning they completely lack all ventral and lateral structures and develop exclusively as dorsal tissue.\n\nAnother gene, *Twist* (`twi`), is a zygotic gene whose expression is activated in the ventral-most cells by high concentrations of the Dorsal protein. A homozygous null mutation in the *Twist* gene (`twi/twi`) within the embryo's own genome results in the failure to form mesoderm, the most ventral tissue, although other ventral and lateral cell types are still specified.\n\nAssume that both the `dl` and `twi` genes are located on different autosomes, so they assort independently. Their respective null alleles, `dl` and `twi`, are recessive to their wild-type alleles, `dl+` and `twi+`.\n\nA geneticist performs the following series of crosses:\n1.  A population of true-breeding wild-type female flies (`dl+/dl+ ; twi+/twi+`) is crossed with a population of true-breeding male flies that are homozygous mutant for both genes (`dl/dl ; twi/twi`).\n2.  The resulting F1 generation flies are collected and allowed to interbreed.\n3.
