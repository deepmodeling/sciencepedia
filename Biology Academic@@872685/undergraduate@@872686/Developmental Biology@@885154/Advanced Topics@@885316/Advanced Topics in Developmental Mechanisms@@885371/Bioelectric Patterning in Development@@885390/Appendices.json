{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the direction of ion flow is fundamental to bioelectricity. This practice explores the core concept of electrochemical driving force, which is the net force acting on an ion due to both the concentration gradient and the membrane voltage. By comparing a cell's resting membrane potential ($V_m$) to an ion's equilibrium potential ($E_{ion}$), we can predict whether the ion will flow into or out of the cell, and whether this flow will cause depolarization or hyperpolarization. This exercise [@problem_id:1672597] applies this principle to the fascinating context of early neural development, where the neurotransmitter GABA can have an excitatory effect, contrary to its role in the mature brain.", "problem": "In the early stages of vertebrate nervous system development, the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) often acts as an excitatory signal, a role that is contrary to its primarily inhibitory function in the mature brain. This functional switch is due to differences in intracellular ion concentrations. Consider a single embryonic neuron at a specific developmental stage. The resting membrane potential of this neuron is measured to be $V_m = -65 \\text{ mV}$. Due to the activity of specific ion transporters, the Nernst equilibrium potential for chloride ions ($Cl^{-}$) in this cell is $E_{Cl} = -35 \\text{ mV}$. At this moment, a presynaptic neuron releases GABA, which binds to and opens GABA-A receptors on the surface of our embryonic neuron. The GABA-A receptor is a ligand-gated channel that is selectively permeable to $Cl^{-}$ ions.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the immediate consequence of the GABA-A channels opening?\n\nA. Chloride ions will flow out of the cell, causing a depolarization.\n\nB. Chloride ions will flow into the a cell, causing a hyperpolarization.\n\nC. Chloride ions will flow out of the cell, causing a hyperpolarization.\n\nD. Chloride ions will flow into the cell, causing a depolarization.\n\nE. There will be no net flow of chloride ions because the chemical and electrical gradients for chloride are perfectly balanced.", "solution": "We are given the resting membrane potential $V_{m}=-65 \\text{ mV}$ and the Nernst equilibrium potential for chloride $E_{Cl}=-35 \\text{ mV}$. Opening GABA-A receptors increases the membrane conductance to $Cl^{-}$.\n\nPhysical principle 1: For an ion with equilibrium potential $E_{i}$, opening its channels drives the membrane potential $V_{m}$ toward $E_{i}$. Therefore, if $V_{m}<E_{Cl}$, the net effect of opening $Cl^{-}$ channels is a depolarization (movement toward a less negative value), since $E_{Cl}=-35 \\text{ mV}$ is less negative than $V_{m}=-65 \\text{ mV}$.\n\nPhysical principle 2: The instantaneous current carried by ion $i$ through its open channels can be written as\n$$\nI_{i}=g_{i}\\left(V_{m}-E_{i}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $g_{i}$ is the conductance. For chloride,\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{Cl}=-65-(-35)=-30 \\text{ mV}<0,\n$$\nso $I_{Cl}=g_{Cl}(V_{m}-E_{Cl})<0$. The negative sign indicates a current that depolarizes the membrane starting from $V_{m}=-65 \\text{ mV}$ when $E_{Cl}=-35 \\text{ mV}$. Because $Cl^{-}$ is a negative ion, depolarization (making the inside less negative) corresponds to a net efflux of negative charge, i.e., $Cl^{-}$ leaving the cell.\n\nThus, upon opening GABA-A channels under these conditions, chloride ions flow out of the cell and the membrane depolarizes. This matches option A. The alternatives are inconsistent: influx of $Cl^{-}$ would add negative charge and hyperpolarize (contrary to $E_{Cl}>V_{m}$), and no net flow is incorrect because $V_{m}\\neq E_{Cl}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1672597"}, {"introduction": "Bioelectric states can act as direct signals for controlling gene expression and cell fate.
