They hypothesize that *IPN* is subject to genomic imprinting. To test this, they use bisulfite sequencing to quantify the methylation status of a specific CpG island within the promoter region of the *IPN* gene.\n\nThe team provides you with the following definitions and data:\n- A Differentially Methylated Region (DMR) is a genomic region that shows different methylation patterns between the paternal and maternal alleles.\n- A germline DMR (gDMR) is a region where this differential methylation is established in the gametes (sperm or oocytes) and is robustly maintained after fertilization, escaping the global wave of demethylation that occurs in the preimplantation embryo.\n- A somatic DMR (sDMR) is a region where differential methylation is established *de novo* during embryonic development in somatic lineages and is not inherited from the gametes.\n\nHere is the methylation data for the CpG island in the *IPN* promoter:\n- Methylation in mature oocytes: 98%\n- Methylation in mature sperm: 4%\n- Methylation in the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts derived from these gametes: 51%\n\nBased on the provided definitions and data, which of the following statements correctly classifies the *IPN* promoter region?\n\nA. It is a somatic DMR because the 51% methylation in the blastocyst is a novel pattern established after fertilization, distinct from either gamete.\n\nB. It is a germline DMR because the original methylation patterns from the gametes are erased in the zygote and then re-established to an average level of 51% in the blastocyst.\n\nC. It is a germline DMR because the differential methylation established in the sperm and oocyte is maintained through early development, resulting in an intermediate methylation level in the diploid blastocyst cells.\n\nD. It is neither a gDMR nor an sDMR because a methylation level of 51% indicates a failure in the demethylation process rather than a controlled imprinting mechanism.\n\nE. It is a somatic DMR because the pattern is established in the blastocyst, which is a somatic stage, and will be propagated to all subsequent somatic cells.", "solution": "We are given definitions:\n- A DMR is a region with different methylation between paternal and maternal alleles.\n- A gDMR is established in the gametes and maintained after fertilization, escaping the global demethylation in the preimplantation embryo.\n- An sDMR is established de novo during embryonic development and is not inherited from the gametes.\n\nThe data for the CpG island in the IPN promoter are:\n- Methylation in mature oocytes: $0.98$.\n- Methylation in mature sperm: $0.04$.\n- Methylation in the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts: $0.51$.\n\nLogical evaluation:\n1) Under the gDMR model, differential methylation established in the gametes is maintained after fertilization. In diploid ICM cells, each cell carries one maternal allele and one paternal allele. If the maternal allele remains methylated at approximately $0.98$ and the paternal allele remains unmethylated at approximately $0.04$, then the expected bulk methylation measured across both alleles is the average:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ICM,\\,expected}}=\\frac{M_{\\mathrm{oocyte}}+M_{\\mathrm{sperm}}}{2}=\\frac{0.98+0.04}{2}=0.51,\n$$\nwhich matches the observed $0.51$. This intermediate value arises from allele-specific maintenance (one methylated, one unmethylated allele), not from a novel pattern.\n\n2) Under the sDMR model, the differential methylation would be established de novo in somatic lineages and not inherited from the gametes. However, the data already demonstrate strong differential methylation in the gametes themselves ($0.98$ versus $0.04$), directly supporting a germline origin rather than a de novo somatic establishment.\n\n3) Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because $0.51$ is exactly the expected average from maintained parental marks, not a novel somatic pattern.\n- B is incorrect because gDMRs are defined by escaping erasure; they are not erased and re-established to an average. Moreover, an “average” re-establishment would imply similar methylation on both alleles, not allele-specific maintenance.\n- C is correct because the differential methylation established in gametes is maintained in early development, yielding an intermediate average in diploid ICM cells due to one methylated and one unmethylated allele.\n- D is incorrect because $0.51$ reflects controlled allele-specific maintenance (imprinting), not a failure of demethylation.\n- E is incorrect because the pattern is inherited from gametes (germline) and the blastocyst ICM is part of preimplantation development; the defining feature here is germline inheritance, not somatic de novo establishment.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is a germline DMR, as stated in C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1680977"}, {"introduction": "Imprinting is often controlled by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that act *in cis* to silence genes on the same chromosome from which they are transcribed. This thought experiment explores the critical importance of this spatial restriction by asking you to predict the consequences if such a lncRNA could suddenly act *in trans* [@problem_id:1680964]. By working through this hypothetical scenario, you will develop a deeper appreciation for how the localization of regulatory molecules is essential for maintaining precise gene expression.", "problem": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that causes genes to be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. A well-studied example occurs at the human chromosome 11p15.5 locus, which is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a congenital overgrowth disorder. In a normal individual, the paternal allele at this locus expresses a long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) called *Kcnq1ot1*. This lncRNA acts *in cis*, remaining associated with the paternal chromosome from which it was transcribed, to recruit silencing machinery that suppresses the expression of several nearby genes, including the potent cell-cycle inhibitor *Cdkn1c*. Conversely, the promoter of *Kcnq1ot1* on the maternal allele is silenced by DNA methylation, preventing its expression. This allows the maternal copy of *Cdkn1c* to be expressed, providing the cell with a single functional dose of this crucial growth regulator.\n\nConsider a hypothetical and novel mutation that does not alter the expression pattern of *Kcnq1ot1* (i.e., it is still expressed only from the paternal allele) but instead modifies the lncRNA molecule itself. This modification disrupts its tethering to the paternal chromosome, allowing it to diffuse freely within the nucleus and function *in trans*. Assuming this diffusible *Kcnq1ot1* lncRNA retains its ability to recognize its target DNA sequences and recruit silencing machinery, what is the most likely outcome for an individual carrying this mutation compared to the phenotype of classical BWS?\n\nA. A phenotype identical to classical BWS, as the primary effect is the silencing of the maternal *Cdkn1c* allele, leading to biallelic loss of the growth inhibitor.\n\nB. No discernible phenotype, because the total amount of *Kcnq1ot1* lncRNA in the nucleus remains unchanged.\n\nC. A milder form of BWS, because the *trans*-acting silencing of the maternal *Cdkn1c* allele would be less efficient than the natural *cis*-silencing on the paternal allele.\n\nD. A significantly more severe, likely embryonic lethal, phenotype distinct from classical BWS due to widespread off-target silencing of genes across the genome.\n\nE. A growth-retardation phenotype, opposite to BWS, due to a compensatory overexpression of *Cdkn1c* or other growth inhibitors.", "solution": "1) State the normal imprinting logic at 11p15.5. On the paternal chromosome, the lncRNA *Kcnq1ot1* is expressed and acts in cis, remaining tethered to the paternal allele to recruit repressive complexes (e.g., Polycomb complexes and DNA methyltransferases) that silence a domain of nearby genes, including *Cdkn1c*. On the maternal chromosome, the *Kcnq1ot1* promoter is methylated and silenced, so no lncRNA is produced there; accordingly, *Cdkn1c* is expressed only from the maternal allele, providing the single functional dose required for normal growth control.\n\n2) Recall the classical BWS mechanism within this domain. One common cause of BWS is loss of methylation at the maternal KvDMR/ICR2, which results in de-repressed *Kcnq1ot1* on the maternal allele. The maternal lncRNA then acts in cis on the maternal chromosome to silence the same domain there, including *Cdkn1c*. The net result is loss of *Cdkn1c* expression altogether (both alleles off), contributing to overgrowth but typically compatible with postnatal survival.\n\n3) Define the hypothetical mutation. The expression pattern of *Kcnq1ot1* remains imprinted (only paternal allele produces the lncRNA), but the RNA loses its cis-tethering and can diffuse within the nucleus to act in trans. The problem states that this diffusible lncRNA retains its capacity to recognize its target DNA sequences and to recruit silencing machinery.\n\n4) Predict consequences at the 11p15.5 locus. Because the lncRNA can now access both homologous chromosomes, it is expected to silence the same domain on the maternal allele in trans, including the maternal *Cdkn1c* locus. At minimum, this reproduces the domain-wide silencing typically observed when the maternal allele expresses *Kcnq1ot1* in cis (as in classical BWS). Thus, the maternal *Cdkn1c* would be silenced even though its promoter remains methylated, because silencing now arrives via trans-acting paternal lncRNA. This already produces a loss of *Cdkn1c* dosage comparable to BWS caused by maternal domain silencing.\n\n5) Evaluate whether the phenotype would be identical to, milder than, or more severe than classical BWS. \n- Not identical (option A) because the mechanistic constraint that normally limits *Kcnq1ot1* to cis is removed. The lncRNA can now explore nuclear space and bind any target DNA it can recognize beyond the maternal homologous domain, potentially affecting additional loci. Moreover, in classical BWS the silencing is generally confined to the imprinted domain(s) on the maternal allele; here, spatial restriction is lost.\n- Not milder (option C) because the assumption explicitly preserves recognition and recruitment functions. There is no provided basis for reduced efficiency; in fact, removal of the cis constraint increases the set of accessible targets.\n- Not neutral (option B). Although the total RNA amount is unchanged, nuclear localization and target reach are fundamentally altered. Spatial regulation is key for lncRNA specificity.\n- Not growth-retarding (option E). *Kcnq1ot1* recruits silencing machinery; its broader reach would not overexpress *Cdkn1c* or other inhibitors, but instead risks further repression.\n\n6) Most likely broader, deleterious impact. Many lncRNA targeting interactions are mediated by combinations of sequence/structure elements and chromatin features that are not strictly unique to a single locus. If *Kcnq1ot1* is free to diffuse and retains target recognition, it could bind and nucleate repressive chromatin at multiple homologous or partially homologous sites, including the entire maternal imprinted domain and potentially other genomic locations that share binding determinants (e.g., repetitive elements or epigenetic marks that facilitate recruitment). This would produce widespread ectopic silencing, threatening essential gene expression programs and likely causing a phenotype far more severe than classical BWS, potentially embryonic lethality.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a significantly more severe, likely embryonic lethal, phenotype distinct from classical BWS due to widespread off-target silencing across the genome, consistent with option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1680964"}, {"introduction": "Errors in establishing or maintaining imprints, known as epimutations, can cause severe developmental disorders.

Deviations from this pattern, known as epimutations, can lead to severe developmental disorders.\n\nA research team is investigating the genetic basis of a novel, multi-system developmental disorder in a patient (proband). They suspect a *de novo* epimutation at an ICR. To test this, they perform Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) on the proband and both of their unaffected parents (mother and father). The team focuses their analysis on two specific genomic loci:\n\n1.  **Candidate Locus 1:** A known ICR on chromosome 7, suspected to be involved in the disorder.\n2.  **Candidate Locus 2:** A control region, the promoter of a housekeeping gene, which is expected to be constitutively unmethylated across all individuals.\n\nFor each locus in each individual, the sequencing data provides the number of methylated cytosine reads ($m$) and unmethylated cytosine reads ($u$).\n\nThe raw read counts are as follows:\n- **For Locus 1 (ICR):**\n    - Mother: $m_M = 510$, $u_M = 490$\n    - Father: $m_F = 482$, $u_F = 518$\n    - Proband: $m_P = 825$, $u_P = 175$\n- **For Locus 2 (Control Promoter):**\n    - Mother: $m_M = 5$, $u_M = 995$\n    - Father: $m_F = 8$, $u_F = 992$\n    - Proband: $m_P = 7$, $u_P = 993$\n\nTo quantify the evidence for a *de novo* epimutation, the researchers define a metric called the Proband-Parental Methylation Divergence (PPMD).
