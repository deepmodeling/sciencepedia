This tissue organizes itself into paired blocks called somites, which act as fundamental building blocks for the skeleton, muscles, and dermis.

This intervention completely prevents the paraxial mesoderm, which initially forms as two continuous columns of cells on either side of the notochord, from undergoing its normal process of segmentation. Consequently, the distinct, paired blocks of tissue known as somites fail to form. Assuming the embryo is viable and continues to develop past this early stage, which of the following groups of structures would be expected to be most severely malformed or entirely absent as a direct result of this specific developmental failure?\n\nA.

If this mechanism is inhibited, the paraxial mesoderm remains unsegmented, and somites fail to form.\n\nSomites are transient, segmental structures derived from paraxial mesoderm that differentiate into:\n- Sclerotome: gives rise to the axial skeleton, including vertebrae and ribs.\n- Myotome: gives rise to skeletal muscle of the back (epaxial) and body wall/limbs (hypaxial), with limb skeletal muscle derived from migrating myogenic precursors from somites.\n- Dermatome: gives rise to the dermis of the back.\n\nTherefore, the most severely malformed or absent structures would be those deriving from sclerotome and myotome: the vertebral column, the ribs, and the skeletal muscles of the back and limbs.\n\nBy contrast:\n- The heart, major blood vessels, and gut smooth muscle (Option A) derive largely from splanchnic (lateral plate) mesoderm.\n- The kidneys, gonads, and adrenal cortex (Option B) derive primarily from intermediate mesoderm (with adrenal cortex from mesoderm and medulla from neural crest).\n- The brain and spinal cord (Option C) derive from neuroectoderm, and pigment cells from neural crest.\n- The lining of the lungs, liver, and pancreas (Option E) derive from endoderm.\n\nThus, only Option D directly reflects derivatives of somites, which would be disrupted by failure of somitogenesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1706427"}, {"introduction": "How do we know which embryonic tissues give rise to which adult organs?

Primordial germ cells originate outside the intermediate mesoderm (from epiblast/yolk sac region), but the gonad’s somatic components derive from intermediate mesoderm; thus the gonad is predominantly intermediate mesoderm-derived.\n- Lateral plate mesoderm (splanchnic) gives rise to the heart and blood vessels.\n\nRecall other germ layers:\n- Neural ectoderm (neural tube) gives rise to the brain and spinal cord.\n- Endoderm gives rise to the epithelial lining of the digestive tract and the epithelium of the lungs.\n\nMatch options to germ layer origins:\n- A (heart and blood vessels): lateral plate mesoderm, not intermediate mesoderm.\n- B (kidneys and gonads): intermediate mesoderm derivatives; thus predominantly quail-type nuclei in the chimera.\n- C (vertebrae and ribs): paraxial mesoderm (sclerotome), not intermediate mesoderm.\n- D (brain and spinal cord): neural ectoderm, not mesoderm.\n- E (lining of digestive tract and lungs): endoderm, not mesoderm.\n\nConclusion: Only the organs derived from intermediate mesoderm—kidneys and the (somatic components of) gonads—will be predominantly composed of quail-derived cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1706450"}, {"introduction": "Scientific knowledge in developmental biology is built upon a foundation of testable hypotheses about how cells communicate and make fate decisions. This final practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist by evaluating different approaches to test a specific hypothesis about inductive signaling. Your task is to determine which experimental design provides the most definitive proof for how signals from one mesodermal tissue might influence the fate of its neighbor, moving beyond knowing facts to understanding the process of scientific discovery [@problem_id:1706465].", "problem": "In vertebrate embryogenesis, the mesoderm differentiates into several distinct lineages. The intermediate mesoderm gives rise to the urogenital system, including the kidneys and the gonads. Adjacent to the intermediate mesoderm is the splanchnic mesoderm, which forms the smooth muscle and connective tissue of the gut tube. These two mesodermal populations are separated by the embryonic coelom, a fluid-filled cavity.\n\nA developmental biologist proposes a specific hypothesis: \"Secreted signaling molecules, originating from the splanchnic mesoderm, diffuse across the embryonic coelom and are essential for instructing the adjacent intermediate mesoderm to adopt a gonadal fate. In the absence of this signal, the intermediate mesoderm follows a default pathway to form kidney tissue.\"\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs would provide the single most definitive and direct test of this complete hypothesis *in vivo*?\n\nA. Generate a genetically engineered mouse model where a candidate pro-gonadal gene, such as *Fgf9*, is conditionally inactivated only in the cells of the splanchnic mesoderm. Then, analyze the resulting phenotype of the intermediate mesoderm-derived structures.\n\nB. Surgically microdissect splanchnic mesoderm and intermediate mesoderm from a chick embryo. Culture the intermediate mesoderm tissue *in vitro* in a medium that has been previously \"conditioned\" by the splanchnic mesoderm culture for 24 hours. Assess the expression of gonad-specific markers in the intermediate mesoderm explant.\n\nC. Using a chick embryo model, which allows for surgical access, introduce a thin, inert, and impermeable polymer film into the embryonic coelom. The film should be positioned to act as a physical barrier that completely separates the splanchnic mesoderm from the intermediate mesoderm, preventing fluid exchange, but without damaging either tissue. Then, assess the fate of the intermediate mesoderm.\n\nD. Create a quail-chick chimera by surgically replacing a segment of the splanchnic mesoderm of a host chick embryo with the equivalent tissue from a donor quail embryo. Use quail-specific antibodies to confirm the transplanted tissue's location and survival. Then, examine the developmental fate of the adjacent host (chick) intermediate mesoderm.", "solution": "The stated hypothesis has three key components: (i) the source of the instructive cue is the splanchnic mesoderm, (ii) the cue is a secreted molecule that must diffuse across the embryonic coelom to reach the intermediate mesoderm, and (iii) this cue is necessary for the intermediate mesoderm to adopt a gonadal fate; without it, the intermediate mesoderm defaults to kidney fate.\n\nA single, definitive, and direct in vivo test must simultaneously address necessity and the route of action (diffusion across the coelom) while preserving tissue integrity. The most direct way to do this is to physically prevent diffusion of secreted molecules between the splanchnic and intermediate mesoderm without perturbing either tissue itself. If gonadal fate fails and kidney fate ensues under this barrier, it supports both the necessity of a secreted signal and its diffusion across the coelom; if gonadal fate proceeds despite the barrier, it refutes the hypothesis or indicates an alternative mechanism (e.g., another source or contact-dependent signaling).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A tests the necessity of a specific candidate gene in the splanchnic mesoderm, but it neither establishes that the signal is diffusible across the coelom nor excludes genetic redundancy. A negative result would be inconclusive; a positive result would be gene-specific and not a complete test of the stated mechanism.\n- Option B is in vitro, which fails the in vivo requirement and primarily tests sufficiency, not necessity or the coelomic diffusion route.\n- Option C installs an impermeable barrier in vivo that blocks fluid exchange across the coelom while preserving tissue integrity, directly testing the necessity of a diffusible signal from splanchnic mesoderm to intermediate mesoderm via the coelom. This directly addresses all components of the hypothesis in vivo.\n- Option D assesses cross-species sufficiency and tissue autonomy but does not specifically test diffusion via the coelom or necessity.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the single most definitive and direct in vivo test of the complete hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1706465"}]}
