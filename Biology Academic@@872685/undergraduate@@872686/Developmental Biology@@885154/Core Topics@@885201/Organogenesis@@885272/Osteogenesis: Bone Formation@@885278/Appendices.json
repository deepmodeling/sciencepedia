This gene's expression is restricted to cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Consequently, *Mouse A* lacks effective bone-resorbing osteoclasts.\n\nThe second model, *Mouse B*, has a gain-of-function mutation in a master transcription factor gene that significantly increases the bone-forming activity of osteoblasts. This gene's expression is restricted to cells of the mesenchymal lineage. Consequently, *Mouse B* exhibits excessive bone deposition.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where both *Mouse A* and *Mouse B* are subjected to a standard Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT).
