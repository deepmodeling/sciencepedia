This exercise explores the crucial concept of gene dosage, using the eye-development gene *Pax6* as a model. You will see that it's not enough for a gene to be simply 'on'; the exact level of its protein product can dramatically alter the developmental outcome, leading to a spectrum of phenotypes from normal to complete absence of the organ [@problem_id:1704124].", "problem": "The transcription factor Pax6 is a highly conserved \"master regulator\" of eye development across many species. The precise level of functional Pax6 protein, a concept known as gene dosage, is critical for the proper formation of the eye. In mice, it is known that homozygous null mutants (*Pax6*⁻/⁻), which produce no functional Pax6 protein, fail to develop any eye structures, a condition called anophthalmia. Heterozygous mutants (*Pax6*⁺/⁻), which produce approximately 50% of the normal amount of Pax6 protein, exhibit microphthalmia (abnormally small eyes) and lack an iris (aniridia).\n\nImagine a geneticist creates a new mouse line with a hypomorphic allele of *Pax6*, denoted as *Pax6*ʰʸᵖᵒ. This allele contains a mutation in its regulatory region that significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, the transcription of the gene. A homozygous mouse for this allele (*Pax6*ʰʸᵖᵒ/*Pax6*ʰʸᵖᵒ) produces approximately 30% of the normal, wild-type level of functional Pax6 protein.\n\nBased on your understanding of gene dosage and the role of Pax6 in eye development, which of the following phenotypes is the most likely outcome for a *Pax6*ʰʸᵖᵒ/*Pax6*ʰʸᵖᵒ homozygous mouse?\n\nA. Complete absence of eyes (anophthalmia).\n\nB. Structurally complete and normal-sized eyes, identical to a wild-type mouse.\n\nC. The formation of abnormally small eyes (microphthalmia) with potential structural defects.\n\nD. The formation of a single, cyclopic eye in the center of the head.\n\nE. The formation of a normal-sized optic cup, but a complete failure of the lens to develop.", "solution": "Pax6 functions as a dosage-sensitive master regulator of eye development. The phenotypic outcome correlates with the level of functional Pax6 protein:\n- At approximately 0 (homozygous null), mice exhibit anophthalmia due to the complete failure of eye structures to initiate.\n- At approximately 0.5 (heterozygous), mice exhibit microphthalmia and structural defects such as aniridia, reflecting partial but insufficient activation of downstream eye developmental programs.\n\nA hypomorphic homozygote producing approximately 0.3 of normal Pax6 protein falls between these two reference points. Because there is not a complete absence of Pax6, complete failure of eye induction (anophthalmia) is unlikely. However, because 0.3 is lower than 0.5, the phenotype is expected to be at least as severe as, and likely more severe than, the heterozygous condition, manifesting as small eyes with structural abnormalities due to insufficient activation of gene networks required for normal morphogenesis.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A (anophthalmia) is most consistent with approximately 0, not with 0.3.\n- B (normal eyes) requires near-wild-type dosage, inconsistent with 0.3.\n- C (microphthalmia with structural defects) matches the expected intermediate, dosage-sensitive phenotype below the heterozygous level.\n- D (cyclopia) is typically associated with midline patterning defects, such as impaired Sonic hedgehog signaling, not isolated Pax6 dosage reduction.\n- E (normal-sized optic cup with complete lens failure) is internally inconsistent with reduced Pax6: reduced Pax6 would compromise both optic cup growth and lens induction; a normal-sized cup is unlikely at 0.3, and complete lens failure would be more consistent with near-absent Pax6 in the surface ectoderm.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is microphthalmia with structural defects.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1704124"}, {"introduction": "As the retina develops, a pool of seemingly identical progenitor cells produces a variety of different neurons in a strict, predictable order. This raises a fundamental question: what controls this timing? This problem challenges you to think like an experimental biologist and evaluate evidence for the \"competence model,\" a key hypothesis suggesting that progenitor cells have an intrinsic developmental clock that changes their potential over time. Your task is to interpret hypothetical data from a cell culture experiment to see which outcome provides the strongest support for this idea [@problem_id:1704126].", "problem": "In the developing vertebrate retina, a pool of multipotent Retinal Progenitor Cells (RPCs) gives rise to all seven major retinal cell types in a precise and conserved temporal order. Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) are the first type of neuron to be born, while other cells, like bipolar cells, are born at later stages. A key hypothesis, known as the \"competence model,\" proposes that the potential of an RPC to generate a specific cell type is intrinsically regulated and changes over developmental time. Specifically, it suggests that late-stage RPCs lose their competence to generate early-born cell types like RGCs.\n\nAn experiment is designed to test this hypothesis. RPCs are isolated from mouse retinas at two different time points:\n1.  **Early Progenitors**: From Embryonic day 14 (E14), a time of peak RGC genesis.\n2.  **Late Progenitors**: From Postnatal day 1 (P1), a time when RGC genesis has ceased and late-born cells, such as bipolar cells, are actively being produced.\n\nBoth populations of isolated RPCs are dissociated into single cells and cultured for one week *in vitro* under identical conditions that promote neuronal differentiation. After the culture period, the identity of the resulting cells is determined by immunofluorescent staining for two specific protein markers: `Marker_RGC` for Retinal Ganglion Cells and `Marker_BC` for bipolar cells. The data is presented as the percentage of all differentiated cells in the culture that are positive for each marker.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest support for the hypothesis that RPCs intrinsically lose their competence to generate RGCs as development progresses?\n\nA.\nE14 Progenitors: 40% `Marker_RGC` positive, 5% `Marker_BC` positive.\nP1 Progenitors: 1% `Marker_RGC` positive, 35% `Marker_BC` positive.\n\nB.\nE14 Progenitors: 20% `Marker_RGC` positive, 20% `Marker_BC` positive.\nP1 Progenitors: 21% `Marker_RGC` positive, 19% `Marker_BC` positive.\n\nC.\nE14 Progenitors: 40% `Marker_RGC` positive, 5% `Marker_BC` positive.\nP1 Progenitors: 38% `Marker_RGC` positive, 6% `Marker_BC` positive.\n\nD.\nE14 Progenitors: 2% `Marker_RGC` positive, 30% `Marker_BC` positive.\nP1 Progenitors: 45% `Marker_RGC` positive, 4% `Marker_BC` positive.\n\nE.\nE14 Progenitors: 40% `Marker_RGC` positive, 10% `Marker_BC` positive.\nP1 Progenitors: 20% `Marker_RGC` positive, 25% `Marker_BC` positive.", "solution": "We are testing the competence model, which states that retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) intrinsically change over developmental time such that late-stage RPCs lose competence to generate early-born cell types like retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The key experimental design feature is that both early (E14) and late (P1) RPCs are cultured under identical conditions promoting neuronal differentiation. Therefore, any differences in the cell fates they adopt reflect intrinsic properties of the RPCs rather than extrinsic environmental cues.\n\nPrediction derived from the hypothesis:\n1. Early progenitors (E14), at the peak of RGC genesis, should intrinsically generate a relatively high fraction of RGCs and a lower fraction of late-born types like bipolar cells.\n2. Late progenitors (P1), after RGC genesis has ceased in vivo, should intrinsically generate very few RGCs and relatively more late-born cells such as bipolar cells.\n3. Because conditions are identical in vitro, a strong reduction or near-absence of RGCs from P1 progenitors, contrasted with abundant RGCs from E14 progenitors, would provide strong support for intrinsic loss of competence.\n\nEvaluate each option using decimals for proportions:\n- Option A:\n  E14: $0.40$ RGC, $0.05$ bipolar.\n  P1: $0.01$ RGC, $0.35$ bipolar.\n  This shows a strong shift: early RPCs yield many RGCs and few bipolars, while late RPCs yield almost no RGCs and many bipolars. This matches the predicted intrinsic loss of RGC competence and gain of late-born fate production. This provides strong support.\n\n- Option B:\n  E14: $0.20$ RGC, $0.20$ bipolar.\n  P1: $0.21$ RGC, $0.19$ bipolar.\n  Nearly identical distributions, implying no intrinsic change; does not support the hypothesis.\n\n- Option C:\n  E14: $0.40$ RGC, $0.05$ bipolar.\n  P1: $0.38$ RGC, $0.06$ bipolar.\n  Essentially unchanged fate output; contradicts the predicted loss of RGC competence.\n\n- Option D:\n  E14: $0.02$ RGC, $0.30$ bipolar.\n  P1: $0.45$ RGC, $0.04$ bipolar.\n  Late progenitors generate more RGCs than early progenitors; directly contradicts the hypothesis.\n\n- Option E:\n  E14: $0.40$ RGC, $0.10$ bipolar.\n  P1: $0.20$ RGC, $0.25$ bipolar.\n  Shows a reduction in RGCs and an increase in bipolars for P1 relative to E14, which is consistent with some intrinsic loss of competence. However, P1 still produces a substantial fraction of RGCs ($0.20$), so this is weaker support than Option A, which shows near-complete loss of RGC generation by P1 RPCs.\n\nTherefore, the outcome that most strongly supports intrinsic loss of competence for RGC generation in late RPCs is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1704126"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of temporal competence, this practice delves into the molecular machinery that acts as the 'gears' of the progenitor's internal clock.
