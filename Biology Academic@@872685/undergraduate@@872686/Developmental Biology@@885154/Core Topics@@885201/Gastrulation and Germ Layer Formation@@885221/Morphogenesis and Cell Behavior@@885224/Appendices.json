{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The intricate dance of morphogenesis begins with the fundamental ability of a single cell to move. This process is not random; it is driven by a sophisticated molecular engine within the cell itself. This first practice invites you to think like a cell biologist by predicting the outcome of a classic perturbation experiment. By understanding the immediate effect of a drug that targets the actin cytoskeleton, you can directly probe the machinery responsible for cellular protrusion and migration [@problem_id:1701939].", "problem": "In an in-vitro study of cell motility, a researcher observes a culture of migrating fibroblasts. These cells extend broad, sheet-like protrusions called lamellipodia at their leading edge as they move. To investigate the underlying molecular machinery, the researcher introduces a compound, Cytochalasin D, into the cell culture medium. This specific drug has a well-characterized mechanism of action: it binds to the fast-growing \"barbed\" (or plus) end of filamentous actin (F-actin), effectively preventing the polymerization of new globular actin (G-actin) monomers onto that end.\n\nWhich of the following cellular events would be the most immediate and direct consequence observed at the leading edge of these fibroblasts after the addition of Cytochalasin D?\n\nA. Rapid disassembly of the microtubule organizing center, leading to a loss of cell polarity.\n\nB. Contraction of the rear of the cell, pulling the cell body rapidly backward.\n\nC. Cessation of the formation and forward extension of lamellipodia.\n\nD. Strengthening and enlargement of focal adhesions that anchor the cell to the substrate.\n\nE. Immediate initiation of the cellular program for apoptosis (programmed cell death).", "solution": "Principle: Lamellipodial protrusion at the leading edge is driven by actin polymerization. Specifically, addition of G-actin monomers occurs predominantly at the fast-growing barbed end of F-actin filaments, producing forward membrane protrusion. This process is promoted by nucleation and branching (e.g., via Arp2/3) and sustained by treadmilling, with barbed-end polymerization and pointed-end depolymerization.\n\nDrug mechanism: Cytochalasin D binds to the barbed ends of F-actin, effectively capping them and preventing incorporation of new G-actin monomers at those ends. Therefore, the immediate and direct effect is inhibition of barbed-end polymerization at the leading edge.\n\nImmediate cellular consequence: Without barbed-end polymerization, lamellipodia can no longer extend forward. Existing filaments may continue to depolymerize at their pointed ends, which can lead to retraction, but the most immediate and direct observation is cessation of new protrusive activity at the leading edge.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because microtubule organizing center dynamics and cell polarity are not the immediate, direct targets of Cytochalasin D; the drug targets actin, not microtubules.\n- B is incorrect because rear contraction is driven by myosin II–mediated contractility on actin networks; disrupting actin polymerization at the front does not directly trigger rapid rear contraction and may impair contractility rather than enhance it.\n- C is correct because blocking barbed-end polymerization stops the formation and forward extension of lamellipodia immediately.\n- D is incorrect because focal adhesion strengthening typically requires actin-mediated tension and linkage; disrupting actin polymerization does not directly strengthen and often weakens adhesions over time.\n- E is incorrect because Cytochalasin D does not immediately initiate apoptosis; any cytotoxic effects occur later and are not the most direct, immediate consequence at the leading edge.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct observed effect is the cessation of lamellipodial extension.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1701939"}, {"introduction": "While individual cell movement is crucial, development builds tissues and organs, which requires cells to act as a coordinated collective. Epithelial sheets, which line our organs and form our skin, rely on strong connections between cells to maintain their barrier function. This exercise explores the role of cell-cell adhesion, the molecular 'glue' that holds these sheets together [@problem_id:1701963]. By considering the consequences of disrupting a key adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, you will connect a specific protein's function to the large-scale architecture and integrity of a tissue.", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, a research team is studying a culture of polarized epithelial cells. These cells have formed a confluent, two-dimensional monolayer on a culture dish, exhibiting the characteristic \"cobblestone\" morphology where cells are tightly packed in a polygonal array. To investigate the role of cell-cell adhesion, the researchers add a highly specific inhibitor to the culture medium. This inhibitor is known to selectively and completely disrupt the function of the transmembrane protein E-cadherin, which is a principal component of adherens junctions.\n\nAssuming the cells remain viable, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary morphological and behavioral changes that would be observed in the cell sheet after a sufficient period of incubation with the E-cadherin inhibitor?\n\nA. The cells undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) uniformly across the sheet, leading to its complete disintegration due to the loss of survival signals from cell-cell contacts.\n\nB. The cells lose their tight, polygonal packing, detach from their neighbors, and acquire a more rounded or elongated, migratory phenotype, leading to the dissolution of the contiguous sheet.\n\nC. The cells lose their apical-basal polarity, with proteins normally restricted to the apical surface becoming redistributed, but the cells remain physically attached to each other, maintaining the sheet's integrity.\n\nD. The cells enter a state of rapid, uncontrolled proliferation, causing the monolayer to thicken into a disorganized, multilayered mass due to the loss of contact inhibition.\n\nE. The cells are stimulated to secrete large quantities of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to a significant increase in the stiffness and thickness of the underlying substrate.", "solution": "E-cadherin is the core transmembrane adhesion molecule of epithelial adherens junctions. Its extracellular domain mediates calcium-dependent homophilic binding between adjacent cells, and its intracellular domain binds catenins that link to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby providing mechanical cohesion and stabilizing epithelial architecture and polarity. In a confluent, polarized epithelial monolayer with a cobblestone morphology, adherens junctions are essential for maintaining tight, polygonal packing and the integrity of the contiguous sheet.\n\nA selective, complete inhibition of E-cadherin function specifically disrupts adherens junctions. The primary and most immediate morphological consequence is loss of cell-cell adhesion, leading to cells detaching from neighbors, breaking the contiguous sheet. Freed from junctional constraints, epithelial cells often adopt a rounded or elongated morphology and exhibit increased motility, resembling a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, even if full EMT signaling is not engaged. Thus, the expected dominant observation is dissolution of the cohesive monolayer with cells becoming migratory.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely: uniform apoptosis is not the primary consequence of losing E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion; anoikis classically follows loss of cell-matrix (integrin) adhesion rather than loss of cadherin-mediated contacts, and the prompt specifies that cells remain viable.\n- C is inconsistent: while adherens junctions contribute to establishing and maintaining polarity, complete loss of E-cadherin principally compromises adhesion; maintaining sheet integrity despite total E-cadherin inhibition is unlikely.\n- D is not the primary outcome: loss of contact inhibition and increased proliferation can occur in some contexts after E-cadherin loss, but the immediate, dominant morphological change is detachment and sheet dissolution rather than thickening into multilayers.\n- E lacks a direct mechanistic link: acute E-cadherin inhibition does not directly trigger large-scale extracellular matrix secretion and substrate stiffening as the primary effect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is loss of tight packing, neighbor detachment, acquisition of rounded or elongated migratory phenotypes, and dissolution of the contiguous sheet.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1701963"}, {"introduction": "Knowing how to move and how to stick together are only part of the story; cells must also know where to go and when to stop. During development, vast migrations of cells are precisely guided by molecular 'road signs' and 'stop signals'. This problem presents you with a developmental detective case involving a hypothetical, but logically sound, signaling pathway that governs cell migration [@problem_id:1701930]. By analyzing a specific migratory defect, you will practice the critical skill of deducing a molecular failure from an observable phenotype, revealing the importance of tightly regulated signaling in achieving precise anatomical structure.", "problem": "In the embryonic development of a model vertebrate, the migration of Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) from their site of specification to the nascent gonads is a critical process. This migration is guided by a complex interplay of signaling molecules. Researchers have identified a simplified core pathway governing this process. A chemoattractant, Somatic-Derived Factor 12 (SDF12), is secreted by the developing gonad. PGCs express a surface receptor, R-Motility (RMot), which binds SDF12. This binding activates a cell-intrinsic kinase, Pro-Migratory Kinase (PMK), which in turn phosphorylates a key cytoskeletal regulatory protein called MIG-1. The phosphorylated form of MIG-1, denoted as MIG-1-P, promotes cell motility.\n\nTo ensure the PGCs stop upon arrival, the gonad also secretes a Gonadal Stop Factor (GSF). PGCs express a different surface receptor, R-Arrest (RArr), that binds GSF. GSF-RArr binding activates a cell-intrinsic phosphatase, Stop-Migration Phosphatase (SMP). Activated SMP dephosphorylates MIG-1-P, converting it back to its inactive, non-phosphorylated state (MIG-1), thereby ceasing migration.\n\nIn a genetically engineered strain, experimenters observe that PGCs successfully navigate to the surface of the developing gonad, but instead of colonizing it, they fail to arrest their movement and continue migrating, ultimately dispersing ectopically throughout the posterior of the embryo.\n\nWhich of the following single genetic mutations within the PGCs is the most plausible cause of this specific phenotype?\n\nA. A nonsense mutation leading to a truncated, non-functional PMK protein.\n\nB. A deletion mutation in the gene encoding the RMot receptor, rendering it non-functional.\n\nC. A missense mutation in the gene encoding MIG-1 that alters the target amino acid for phosphorylation, such that PMK can no longer phosphorylate it.\n\nD. A loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the RArr receptor.\n\nE. A gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding SMP that makes the phosphatase constitutively active, regardless of GSF binding.", "solution": "The pathway described has two arms: a pro-migratory arm and a stop/arrest arm. In the pro-migratory arm, SDF12 produced by the gonad binds the PGC receptor RMot, which activates the kinase PMK. PMK phosphorylates the cytoskeletal regulator MIG-1 to produce MIG-1-P, and MIG-1-P drives motility. In the stop arm, GSF produced by the gonad binds the PGC receptor RArr, which activates the phosphatase SMP. SMP dephosphorylates MIG-1-P back to MIG-1, reducing motility and causing arrest.\n\nThe observed phenotype is that PGCs successfully navigate to the surface of the developing gonad but fail to arrest and continue migrating ectopically. Successful navigation to the gonad requires that the pro-migratory SDF12→RMot→PMK→MIG-1 phosphorylation pathway be functional at least to the extent necessary for migration, whereas failure to arrest specifically implicates a defect in the GSF→RArr→SMP dephosphorylation pathway.\n\nEvaluate each option against these requirements:\n\nA. A nonsense mutation in PMK would prevent phosphorylation of MIG-1, reducing or abolishing motility. This would impair migration toward the gonad rather than allow successful arrival followed by failure to arrest, so it does not match the phenotype.\n\nB. A deletion in RMot would block SDF12 sensing and upstream activation of PMK, again impairing migration and preventing arrival at the gonad, which contradicts the observation.\n\nC. A missense mutation in MIG-1 that prevents its phosphorylation by PMK would similarly prevent formation of MIG-1-P and motility, impairing migration to the gonad; this does not fit the observed successful navigation.\n\nD. A loss-of-function mutation in RArr would prevent sensing of GSF and thus fail to activate SMP. Without SMP activation, MIG-1 would remain phosphorylated as MIG-1-P, sustaining motility even at the gonad and causing continued migration and ectopic dispersal. This directly explains the observed failure to arrest despite intact initial migration.\n\nE. A gain-of-function mutation rendering SMP constitutively active would continuously dephosphorylate MIG-1-P, suppressing motility broadly and likely preventing efficient migration to the gonad, the opposite of the observed initial success.\n\nTherefore, the mutation most consistent with the phenotype is a loss-of-function in the GSF receptor RArr, which selectively disrupts the stop signal while preserving the pro-migratory pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1701930"}]}
