This first practice challenges you to dissect the specific functions of a transcription factor. By considering a hypothetical mutant Bicoid protein that can bind to DNA but cannot activate transcription, you will explore the critical difference between DNA binding and transcriptional activation, a fundamental principle in gene regulation. [@problem_id:1713654]", "problem": "In the early development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the body plan is established by a cascade of gene expression. The Bicoid (Bcd) protein, a maternal-effect gene product, is a key morphogen that functions as a transcription factor. It forms a concentration gradient, with the highest concentration at the anterior (head) end of the embryo. One of its primary targets is the zygotic gap gene *hunchback* (*hb*), which Bcd activates to establish the anterior-most segments.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered scenario in a *Drosophila* embryo that lacks any endogenous wild-type Bicoid protein. Instead, it expresses a mutant form of the Bicoid protein. This mutant protein retains its ability to diffuse, form a proper anterior-to-posterior gradient, and bind with normal affinity to the specific DNA sequences in the enhancer region of the *hunchback* gene. However, the mutant protein has a complete loss-of-function mutation in its transcriptional activation domain, meaning it cannot recruit the cellular machinery necessary to initiate transcription.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected pattern of zygotic *hunchback* gene expression in the anterior of this embryo?\n\nA. Zygotic *hunchback* expression will be activated in a broad anterior domain, identical to a wild-type embryo.\n\nB. Zygotic *hunchback* expression will be repressed in the anterior domain where it would normally be expressed.\n\nC. The expression pattern of zygotic *hunchback* will be completely unaffected, as the mutant Bicoid protein is non-functional.\n\nD. Zygotic *hunchback* will be ectopically expressed in the posterior of the embryo.\n\nE. Zygotic *hunchback* will be expressed uniformly at a low level throughout the entire embryo.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the normal mechanism: Bicoid (Bcd) is a maternal transcription factor that forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient and directly activates zygotic transcription of the gap gene *hb* in the anterior by binding its enhancer and, via its transcriptional activation domain, recruiting the transcriptional machinery.\n\nIn the engineered embryo, there is no endogenous wild-type Bcd. The mutant Bcd retains the ability to diffuse, form the normal gradient, and bind the *hb* enhancer with normal affinity, but it lacks a functional transcriptional activation domain. Therefore:\n- It can occupy the Bcd binding sites on the *hb* enhancer.\n- It cannot recruit or stimulate the basal transcription machinery, so it cannot activate transcription.\n- Because it binds with normal affinity and there is no wild-type Bcd, it also competitively prevents any potential activation through the same sites by Bcd (which is absent) or cooperative interactions that depend on an activation-competent Bcd.\n\nConsequently, the principal anterior activator of zygotic *hb* is both absent (no wild-type Bcd) and functionally blocked at the enhancer by the DNA-bound, activation-defective mutant. Thus, the zygotic *hb* anterior expression domain will not be established. Relative to wild type, this is effectively a repression (loss) of the anterior *hb* expression domain, not an unchanged pattern, not an ectopic posterior activation, and not a uniform low-level expression.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that zygotic *hb* expression will be repressed in the anterior domain where it would normally be expressed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1713654"}, {"introduction": "Once activated, gap genes do not exist in isolation; they form a regulatory network that refines their own expression patterns. A cornerstone of this network is mutual repression, where adjacent gap genes inhibit each other to create sharp, non-overlapping domains. This exercise places you in the role of a geneticist, asking you to infer a regulatory relationship by analyzing a mutant phenotype, a classic approach for unraveling the logic of developmental gene networks. [@problem_id:1713659]", "problem": "In the early development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, a cascade of gene expression establishes the anterior-posterior body axis. The first zygotic genes to be expressed in this hierarchy are the gap genes. These genes encode transcription factors that are expressed in broad, overlapping domains. The precise boundaries of these domains are established through mutual repression among the gap genes. In a wild-type embryo, the primary gap genes are expressed in a sequence from anterior to posterior, with the *hunchback* (hb) domain being most anterior, followed by the *Krüppel* (Kr) domain, and then the *knirps* (kni) domain.\n\nA developmental biologist is studying a collection of mutant fly strains. Using in situ hybridization, the biologist observes a particular mutant embryo in which the expression domain of the *knirps* gene is correctly initiated but expands significantly further towards the anterior end of the embryo, overlapping the region where the *Krüppel* gene would normally be expressed.\n\nWhich of the following single genetic mutations is the most plausible explanation for this observed anterior shift in the *knirps* expression domain?\n\nA. A loss-of-function mutation in the *hunchback* gene.\n\nB. A gain-of-function mutation in the *Krüppel* gene, leading to higher levels of Krüppel protein.\n\nC. A loss-of-function mutation in the *Krüppel* gene.\n\nD. A loss-of-function mutation in the pair-rule gene *fushi tarazu* (ftz).\n\nE. A gain-of-function mutation in the *knirps* gene, making it a more potent transcriptional repressor.", "solution": "We begin from the established principle that primary gap gene domains in Drosophila are positioned and sharpened by mutual repression among gap gene transcription factors. In the wild type, the order from anterior to posterior is hunchback (hb), then Kr (Krueppel), then knirps (kni). The anterior boundary of the kni domain is set in part by repression from Kr; reciprocally, kni represses Kr to set Kr’s posterior boundary. Thus, the Kr–kni interface is a classic example of mutual repression defining adjacent gap gene domains.\n\nThe observation states that kni is initiated correctly but its domain expands further anteriorly, overlapping where Kr would normally be expressed. The most direct mechanistic explanation under the mutual repression framework is a loss of the repressor that normally prevents kni from invading anterior territory—namely, loss of Kr function. Without Kr, the anterior boundary of kni is no longer constrained, so kni spreads anteriorly into the region that would have been occupied by Kr.\n\nWe evaluate each option:\n- A (loss of hb): Hb normally represses kni anteriorly and contributes to Kr activation. Loss of hb could de-repress kni anteriorly, but it also broadly disrupts anterior patterning and Kr expression. While anterior kni expansion is conceivable, this mutation would not specifically and most parsimoniously explain an expansion into the Kr territory via the direct Kr–kni interface; it would cause wider anterior defects.\n- B (Kr gain-of-function): Increased Kr would strengthen repression of kni, leading to a posterior shift or contraction of kni, the opposite of the observation.\n- C (Kr loss-of-function): Directly removes repression at the Kr–kni interface, allowing kni to expand anteriorly into the normal Kr domain. This precisely matches the observed phenotype and is the most straightforward single-locus explanation.\n- D (ftz loss-of-function): Pair-rule genes act later than gap genes; ftz mutations disrupt segmental periodicity but do not set primary gap gene domain boundaries. This would not produce the described gap-domain shift.\n- E (kni gain-of-function as stronger repressor): Increased kni repressive potency would more strongly repress Kr, potentially shrinking the Kr domain, but would not by itself expand kni anteriorly unless kni were already activated there. Because kni activation anteriorly is limited by maternal and anterior zygotic inputs (including hb), merely increasing kni’s repressor strength is not the most plausible cause of an anterior expansion of kni’s own expression domain.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible single genetic mutation producing an anterior expansion of the kni domain into the normal Kr territory is a loss-of-function mutation in Kr.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1713659"}, {"introduction": "The complex expression patterns of gap genes are encoded in the genome within specific DNA sequences called enhancers, which act as integration hubs for regulatory signals. But how do scientists identify these crucial elements from vast stretches of non-coding DNA? This final practice shifts our focus to experimental design, challenging you to devise a molecular tool known as a reporter construct to pinpoint the location and function of a specific enhancer, providing insight into the experimental foundations of developmental biology. [@problem_id:1713679]", "problem": "In the early *Drosophila melanogaster* embryo, the gap gene *giant* (*gt*) is expressed in two distinct stripes along the anterior-posterior axis. This spatial pattern is controlled by different *cis*-regulatory DNA sequences known as enhancers, each responding to a unique combination of maternal and zygotic transcription factors. An anterior enhancer drives expression in the anterior stripe, and a posterior enhancer drives expression in the posterior stripe.\n\nA developmental biologist has isolated several non-coding DNA fragments from the genomic region surrounding the *gt* gene. The goal is to identify which fragment, if any, functions as the posterior enhancer. To do this, the biologist will create a transgenic fly by inserting a specially designed DNA construct into its genome. The construct will use the coding sequence for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a protein that glows green under blue light, as a reporter.\n\nWhich of the following DNA constructs would be the most effective for testing if a candidate DNA fragment is the *gt* posterior enhancer?

The candidate DNA fragment, followed by the native *gt* promoter, followed by the *GFP* coding sequence.", "solution": "The goal of this experiment is to create a reporter gene construct that allows us to visualize the activity of a putative enhancer element. An enhancer is a *cis*-regulatory DNA sequence that binds transcription factors to control the timing and location of gene expression. The construct must be designed to specifically report the activity of the enhancer being tested, and nothing else. Let's break down the necessary components and evaluate each option.\n\n1.  **The Element to be Tested:** The core of the experiment is the candidate DNA fragment that is hypothesized to be the *gt* posterior enhancer. This fragment must be included in the construct.\n\n2.  **The Reporter:** We need a way to see where and when the enhancer is active. The problem specifies using the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene. The construct should therefore contain the *coding sequence* for GFP. When the enhancer is active, it will drive the transcription of the *GFP* gene, and the resulting protein will make the cells glow green.\n\n3.  **The Link between Enhancer and Reporter:** An enhancer does not initiate transcription by itself. It serves as a binding platform for transcription factors, which then recruit RNA polymerase to a nearby promoter. Therefore, a promoter is required to start transcription. To isolate the effect of *only* the enhancer we are testing, a *basal* or *minimal* promoter should be used. A basal promoter contains the basic sequences necessary for RNA polymerase to bind (like a TATA box) but does not have strong activity on its own. It is essentially \"off\" until activated by an enhancer. Using the gene's full *native* promoter is incorrect because the native promoter might be complex and have its own regulatory inputs or be influenced by other enhancers, confounding the results.\n\n4.  **The Transcriptional Unit:** A complete transcriptional unit consists of the regulatory elements (enhancer + promoter), the transcribed region (coding sequence), and signals for termination and processing (like the specified polyadenylation signal).\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options based on these principles:\n\n**A. The candidate DNA fragment, followed by a basal (minimal) promoter, followed by the *GFP* coding sequence.**\nThis construct correctly assembles all the necessary parts. The candidate fragment acts as the potential enhancer. The basal promoter provides a site for transcription to begin but will only be activated if the candidate fragment is indeed an enhancer that is active in the posterior region. The *GFP* coding sequence provides a visible report of this activity. This design correctly isolates the regulatory function of the candidate fragment and links it to a reporter.\n\n**B. The candidate DNA fragment, followed by the *GFP* coding sequence.**\nThis construct is missing a promoter. An enhancer cannot initiate transcription on its own; it requires a promoter to which it can recruit RNA polymerase. Without a promoter, no transcription of *GFP* will occur, even if the candidate fragment is a functional enhancer.\n\n**C. The candidate DNA fragment, followed by a basal (minimal) promoter, followed by the *gt* coding sequence.**\nThis construct uses the *gt* coding sequence instead of a reporter gene like *GFP*. This would simply cause the Giant protein to be produced under the control of the candidate enhancer. While this could theoretically be used in a *gt* mutant background to see if it \"rescues\" the posterior phenotype, it is not a reporter construct. The goal is to easily visualize the enhancer's activity, which is best done with a reporter like GFP, not by assaying for the native, non-fluorescent Giant protein.\n\n**D. The native *gt* promoter, followed by the *GFP* coding sequence.**\nThis construct is missing the candidate DNA fragment for the posterior enhancer. It attempts to test the function of the native *gt* promoter itself. If the native promoter is responsive to both the anterior and posterior enhancers, this construct would likely drive GFP expression in both stripes, failing to isolate the function of the posterior enhancer alone.\n\n**E. The candidate DNA fragment, followed by the native *gt* promoter, followed by the *GFP* coding sequence.**\nThis construct uses the native promoter instead of a basal promoter. This is a flawed design because the native promoter might be a complex regulatory region in its own right, potentially containing binding sites for other factors or being influenced by other enhancers (like the anterior one). This would make it impossible to conclude that any observed expression pattern is due *solely* to the candidate fragment. To cleanly test the candidate enhancer, it must be paired with a neutral, basal promoter.\n\nTherefore, option A represents the correct and standard design for an enhancer-testing reporter construct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1713679"}]}
