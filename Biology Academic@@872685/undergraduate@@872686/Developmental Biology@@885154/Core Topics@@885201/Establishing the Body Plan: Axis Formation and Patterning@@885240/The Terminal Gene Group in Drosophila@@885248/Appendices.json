{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The establishment of the embryonic termini depends on a signal that originates from the mother's somatic cells surrounding the oocyte. This first exercise focuses on the source of this signal, controlled by the gene *torso-like*. By considering a loss-of-function mutation in this gene ([@problem_id:1728002]), you will apply the principle of maternal effect to understand how spatial information is conferred from mother to embryo to initiate terminal patterning.", "problem": "In *Drosophila melanogaster*, the development of the non-segmented structures at the extreme anterior (the acron) and posterior (the telson) ends of the embryo is controlled by the terminal group of maternal effect genes. The central component of this system is the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the *torso* gene. The *torso* messenger RNA (mRNA) is deposited by the mother into the oocyte and is translated to produce Torso protein, which becomes uniformly distributed in the egg's cell membrane. The activation of this receptor, however, is spatially restricted to the poles of the embryo. This localized activation depends on a ligand produced by the surrounding somatic follicle cells, but only the follicle cells positioned at the anterior and posterior poles of the oocyte can produce the active ligand. The gene *torso-like* (*tsl*) is expressed in these polar follicle cells and is essential for the production or processing of the Torso ligand. Note that *torso-like* is a maternal effect gene, meaning the phenotype of the embryo is determined by the genotype of the mother.\n\nAn experiment is conducted with a strain of *Drosophila* carrying a recessive, loss-of-function mutation in the *torso-like* gene. A female fly that is homozygous for this mutation is mated with a wild-type male. Considering the mechanism described, what will be the phenotype of the resulting larval cuticle from an embryo produced by this mother?\n\nA. The larva will lack the acron and telson, but the segmented thoracic and abdominal regions will be normal.\n\nB. The larva will develop two telsons, one at each end, and will lack an acron and thoracic segments.\n\nC. The larva will be phenotypically wild-type, showing no defects.\n\nD. The larva will lack the centrally located thoracic and abdominal segments, but the acron and telson will be larger than normal.\n\nE. The larva will lack a telson but possess a normal acron and segmented body.", "solution": "The key principles are maternal effect inheritance and the terminal patterning mechanism. Maternal effect genes determine embryonic phenotype based on the mother’s genotype, regardless of the embryo’s own zygotic genotype. In the Drosophila terminal system, Torso receptor protein is provided uniformly in the embryonic membrane from maternally supplied torso mRNA, but its activation is spatially restricted to the anterior and posterior poles because only the polar follicle cells process and provide the active ligand. The gene torso-like (tsl) is required in these polar follicle cells for production or processing of the Torso ligand; without functional tsl in the mother’s follicle cells, no active ligand is generated at either pole, and thus Torso is not activated anywhere.\n\nGiven a mother homozygous for a recessive loss-of-function mutation in tsl, all embryos she produces will lack Torso pathway activation at both ends. Because Torso signaling specifies terminal structures (acron anteriorly and telson posteriorly) and does not pattern the central segmented trunk (which is patterned by other maternal and zygotic segmentation genes), the consequence is loss of both terminal structures while the thoracic and abdominal segments form normally.\n\nTherefore, the larval cuticle will lack the acron and telson, with otherwise normal segmented thoracic and abdominal regions, matching option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1728002"}, {"introduction": "Once the Torso receptor is activated at the poles, it initiates an intracellular signaling cascade. This next practice uses the powerful genetic tool of epistasis analysis to decipher the logic of this pathway. You are asked to predict the phenotype of a double mutant ([@problem_id:1728037]), which will require you to determine the functional hierarchy between the upstream receptor, Torso, and a critical downstream kinase, D-raf, demonstrating how genetic interactions reveal the flow of biological information.", "problem": "In the early development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis is a multi-step process. A specific genetic system, known as the terminal system, is responsible for specifying the structures at the very ends of the embryo: the acron at the anterior pole and the telson at the posterior pole. The proper function of this system relies on a signal transduction pathway.\n\nConsider two key genes in this pathway:\n1.  The gene *torso* encodes a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) that is uniformly distributed on the surface of the embryo's plasma membrane. In a wild-type embryo, it is activated only at the poles by a localized ligand, initiating the signaling cascade that specifies terminal structures.\n2.  The gene *D-raf* encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which functions as a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAPKKK). This kinase is an essential downstream component in the intracellular signaling cascade initiated by the activated *torso* receptor.\n\nExperiments have characterized the phenotypes of individual mutations in these genes:\n-   Embryos from mothers homozygous for a gain-of-function allele, $torso^{GOF}$, possess a Torso receptor that is constitutively active, meaning it signals constantly, even in the absence of a ligand. The resulting embryonic phenotype is a \"terminalization\" of the body plan, where the central segmented region fails to form and is replaced by expanded acron and telson-like structures.\n-   Embryos from mothers homozygous for a null, loss-of-function allele, $D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$, lack any functional D-raf protein. The resulting embryonic phenotype is a failure to form any terminal structures, leading to a larva that lacks both an acron and a telson.\n\nAn investigator creates a double-mutant fly strain. What is the expected phenotype of an embryo derived from a mother who is homozygous for both the $torso^{GOF}$ allele and the $D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$ allele?\n\nA. The embryo will lack both the acron and the telson, displaying the same phenotype as a $D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$ single mutant.\n\nB. The embryo will exhibit an expansion of terminal structures, displaying the same phenotype as a $torso^{GOF}$ single mutant.\n\nC. The embryo will develop a normal wild-type body plan, as the two mutations cancel each other out.\n\nD. The embryo will display a completely novel and more severe phenotype than either single mutant, such as a complete arrest of development prior to gastrulation.\n\nE. The embryo will develop two telsons, one at the anterior and one at the posterior end, but will lack an acron.", "solution": "We interpret the terminal system as a linear signal transduction pathway in which the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase activates an intracellular cascade that requires D-raf (a MAPKKK) to transmit the signal to downstream effectors that specify terminal fates. The key logical principle is that activation at the receptor level must be propagated through essential downstream components; if a required downstream kinase is absent, the signal cannot elicit terminal fate specification.\n\nDefine a qualitative pathway output variable $O$ representing terminal pathway activity that induces terminal structures. Let $R$ denote receptor activity state and $D$ denote the presence of functional D-raf. Because the receptor’s signal must pass through D-raf, the effective output satisfies the logical conjunction\n$$\nO = R \\land D,\n$$\nmeaning that $O=1$ (terminal signaling on) only if both $R=1$ (receptor signaling active) and $D=1$ (functional D-raf present).\n\nFor a $torso^{GOF}$ mother, $R=1$ everywhere due to constitutive receptor activity. For a $D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$ mother, $D=0$ everywhere due to absence of functional kinase. In the double mutant mother $torso^{GOF};D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$, we have $R=1$ and $D=0$, hence\n$$\nO = 1 \\land 0 = 0.\n$$\nThus, despite constitutive Torso activation, the absence of D-raf abolishes pathway output, preventing specification of terminal structures. In epistasis terms, the downstream loss-of-function in $D\\text{-}raf$ is epistatic to the upstream gain-of-function in $torso$, so the double-mutant phenotype matches the $D\\text{-}raf^{LOF}$ phenotype: embryos lack both acron and telson.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotype corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1728037"}, {"introduction": "The signal emanating from the poles is not simply an on/off switch; it forms a graded concentration profile, or morphogen gradient. This final problem moves from qualitative genetics to a quantitative model of pattern formation, where genes like *tailless* and *huckebein* are activated at distinct concentration thresholds of the signal. By calculating how the steepness of the MAPK gradient affects the size of gene expression domains ([@problem_id:1727987]), you will explore the fundamental principle of how continuous positional information is translated into discrete developmental outcomes.", "problem": "In the early development of a *Drosophila* embryo, the terminal regions (poles) are patterned by a signaling cascade involving the receptor tyrosine kinase Torso. Activation of Torso leads to a localized gradient of activated Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK).

A specific gene is expressed in the region where the MAPK concentration exceeds its activation threshold. Let the threshold for *tll* be $T_{tll}$ and for *hkb* be $T_{hkb}$. It is known that $A_{\\text{max}} > T_{hkb} > T_{tll} > 0$.
