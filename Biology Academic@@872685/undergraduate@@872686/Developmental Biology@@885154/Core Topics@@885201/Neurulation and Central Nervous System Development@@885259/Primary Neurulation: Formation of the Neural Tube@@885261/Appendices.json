This force is generated at the cellular level by apical constriction, a process powered by a contractile network of actin and non-muscle myosin II. This exercise challenges you to think like a molecular geneticist, predicting the consequences of removing the spatial regulation of this molecular motor, which is crucial for forming the localized hinge points that enable folding. [@problem_id:1709551]", "problem": "In vertebrate development, primary neurulation is the process by which the neural plate, a sheet of ectodermal cells, folds into the hollow neural tube, the precursor to the central nervous system. This folding is driven by precise changes in cell shape. Specifically, cells at the Median Hinge Point (MHP) and later at the Dorsolateral Hinge Points (DLHPs) undergo apical constriction, transforming from columnar to wedge-shaped. This process is powered by a contractile ring of actin and Non-Muscle Myosin II (NMII) at the apical surface of these cells. The activity of NMII is normally tightly controlled by the phosphorylation of its regulatory light chain, ensuring that constriction occurs only at the correct time and place.\n\nImagine a genetically engineered model organism where a mutation is introduced into the gene encoding the regulatory light chain of NMII. This mutation results in a protein that keeps NMII in a constitutively active state, independent of its phosphorylation status. Based on your understanding of the cell-biological mechanisms of neurulation, predict the most likely morphological outcome for the neural ectoderm in this mutant embryo.\n\nA. The neural ectoderm fails to form a distinct neural groove and folds. Instead, it undergoes a widespread, shallow buckling or flattening, as apical constriction occurs non-specifically across the entire tissue rather than being localized to hinge points.\n\nB. The neural ectoderm remains a completely flat sheet, with cells failing to undergo any shape change. The tissue behaves as if it has lost all contractile ability.\n\nC. The neural tube forms much more rapidly and is significantly smaller in diameter than normal, due to hyper-accelerated and stronger apical constriction occurring correctly at the MHP and DLHPs.\n\nD. The neuroectodermal cells lose their physical connections to one another and dissociate, failing to maintain a cohesive epithelial sheet required for any organized folding.\n\nE. The neural folds elevate excessively and bypass each other, failing to fuse at the dorsal midline due to an over-shooting of the folding process.", "solution": "Primary neurulation depends on spatially and temporally restricted apical constriction to generate curvature at specific sites. In vertebrates, cells at the Median Hinge Point (MHP) and later at the Dorsolateral Hinge Points (DLHPs) undergo apical constriction, which converts columnar cells into wedge-shaped cells. This localized shape change produces bending moments that create the neural groove and elevate neural folds. The apical constriction is driven by an actomyosin network: Non-Muscle Myosin II (NMII) generates contractile force when its regulatory light chain is phosphorylated by kinases such as MLCK and ROCK, while dephosphorylation by myosin phosphatase turns off activity. Thus, the pattern of regulatory light chain phosphorylation determines where and when apical constriction occurs.\n\nIn the mutant described, the regulatory light chain of NMII is altered so that NMII remains constitutively active, independent of phosphorylation status. This eliminates the normal spatial restriction of myosin activity. As a result, neuroectodermal cells throughout the tissue would engage apical contraction rather than only those at the hinge points. This uniform activation has two key mechanical consequences. First, it removes the curvature gradients necessary for bending at discrete sites; when all cells constrict apically together, the tissue uniformly reduces apical surface area and thickens rather than forming sharp hinges. Second, without localized bending moments, the sheet cannot reliably generate a distinct neural groove; instead, the uniform increase in apical tension may produce shallow, non-specific buckling patterns or maintain a relatively flattened configuration constrained by surrounding tissues, but it will not recapitulate the focused folding at MHP and DLHPs.\n\nConsidering the answer choices:\n- Option A matches the predicted outcome: loss of localized hinge points leads to failure to form a distinct neural groove and folds, with widespread, shallow buckling or flattening due to non-specific apical constriction across the tissue.\n- Option B is inconsistent because constitutive NMII activity would not abolish contractility; it would increase it and remove its regulation.\n- Option C requires that apical constriction still occurs specifically at MHP and DLHPs; however, constitutive activation eliminates this spatial specificity, so accelerated, properly localized folding is unlikely.\n- Option D implies loss of epithelial cohesion, typically associated with adhesion defects rather than uniform myosin activation; while excessive tension can cause tearing in extreme cases, the primary, most likely phenotype is not wholesale dissociation.\n- Option E presumes correctly localized but excessive bending; the mutant instead disrupts localization, making over-elevation and bypass at the dorsal midline less likely than a failure to form discrete folds.\n\nTherefore, the most likely morphological outcome is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1709551"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of apical constriction, we now explore its regulation in time. The process is not continuous but is tightly coupled with the cell cycle, occurring specifically during the $G_1$ phase. This practice problem asks you to investigate this crucial link by considering how selectively shortening or lengthening the $G_1$ phase would impact the ability of cells to change shape and, consequently, the success of neural tube formation. [@problem_id:1709538]", "problem": "During primary neurulation in vertebrate embryos, the flat neural plate transforms into a closed neural tube through a series of coordinated cell shape changes and movements. A key process is apical constriction, where neuroepithelial cells, particularly at the medial hinge point (MHP) and later at the dorsolateral hinge points (DLHPs), contract their apical actin-myosin networks. This transforms them from columnar to wedge-shaped, inducing the intrinsic curvature needed for the neural plate to bend and fold. The cell cycle of these neuroepithelial cells is tightly regulated and linked to their morphology. Following mitosis (M phase) at the apical surface, a cell enters the G1 phase, during which it can undergo apical constriction. Subsequently, its nucleus migrates toward the basal side to undergo DNA synthesis (S phase), and then migrates back apically during G2 to prepare for the next M phase.\n\nConsider two independent, hypothetical genetic experiments performed on a developing chick embryo. In each experiment, the expression of a specific cell cycle regulator is altered in *all* neuroepithelial cells from the onset of neurulation.\n- **Experiment 1:** The G1 phase of the cell cycle is selectively shortened, while the durations of S, G2, and M phases remain normal.\n- **Experiment 2:** The G1 phase of the cell cycle is selectively lengthened, while the durations of S, G2, and M phases remain normal.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate contrast between the likely morphological outcomes of the neural plate and developing neural tube in these two experiments, as compared to a normal embryo?\n\nA. In Experiment 1 (shortened G1), cells become hyper-constricted, leading to exaggerated, premature folding. In Experiment 2 (lengthened G1), cells fail to constrict, resulting in a flat neural plate and failed tube closure.\n\nB. In Experiment 1 (shortened G1), rapid proliferation creates an oversized, wide neural plate that is mechanically unable to fold. In Experiment 2 (lengthened G1), slow proliferation results in an undersized but structurally normal neural tube.\n\nC. In Experiment 1 (shortened G1), cells have insufficient time for apical constriction, remaining columnar, which leads to a flat neural plate and failed tube closure. In Experiment 2 (lengthened G1), cells have extended time for apical constriction, becoming excessively wedge-shaped and causing exaggerated plate bending.\n\nD. In Experiment 1 (shortened G1), failed apical constriction leads to a flat neural plate, but this is compensated for by increased cell adhesion, leading to delayed but successful closure. In Experiment 2 (lengthened G1), cells become permanently arrested in G1, halting all morphogenesis and leading to neural plate disintegration.\n\nE. In both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the alteration of the G1 phase disrupts interkinetic nuclear migration, causing random cell death throughout the neural plate and leading to a catastrophic failure of morphogenesis.", "solution": "Principle linking cell cycle and morphology: In neuroepithelial cells, apical mitoses occur at the apical surface. After M phase, cells enter G1 at the apical side, and apical actomyosin-mediated constriction occurs during G1, producing wedge-shaped cells that generate intrinsic curvature at the medial and dorsolateral hinge points necessary for neural plate bending and tube closure. During S phase the nucleus migrates basally and cells are not engaged in apical constriction; in G2 the nucleus returns apically preparing for M phase.\n\nLogical consequences of altering G1 length:\n- If G1 is shortened while S, G2, and M remain normal, the time window during which a cell can perform apical constriction is reduced. Therefore, each cell achieves less apical area reduction before proceeding to S phase. Population-wide, cells remain more columnar, hinge-point wedging is insufficient, the neural plate bends less, and closure is likely to fail. This directly contradicts any prediction of hyper-constriction or exaggerated folding and is not best explained by plate size alone.\n- If G1 is lengthened while S, G2, and M remain normal, the time window for apical constriction is extended. Cells can attain greater apical constriction, becoming more extremely wedge-shaped. Population-wide, this increases intrinsic curvature, producing deeper hinge points and exaggerated bending of the neural plate, potentially leading to premature or excessive folding rather than flatness.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A incorrectly predicts hyper-constriction with shortened G1 and failure to constrict with lengthened G1; this reverses the time-in-G1 logic.\n- Option B emphasizes proliferation-driven size changes, but while shortening G1 can shorten the overall cell cycle, the most direct and specific morphological effect given the stated mechanism is via altered time available for apical constriction; the predictions about folding quality in B are therefore not the most accurate contrast.\n- Option C correctly maps shortened G1 to insufficient apical constriction and a flat plate with failed closure, and lengthened G1 to excessive constriction with exaggerated bending.\n- Option D introduces unsubstantiated compensation by adhesion and assumes permanent G1 arrest in the lengthening condition, neither of which is implied by the setup.\n- Option E overgeneralizes to random cell death and catastrophic failure from both manipulations without mechanistic basis in the described link between G1 and apical constriction.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate contrast is given by Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1709538"}, {"introduction": "This final challenge moves from analysis to synthesis, placing you in the role of a synthetic biologist. Faced with a developmental defect where cellular constrictions are weak and uncoordinated, your task is to design a solution from the ground up. By architecting a synthetic gene circuit, you will explore how principles of positive feedback can create a \"molecular ratchet\" to restore robust morphogenesis, providing a powerful lesson in applying systems-level thinking to developmental problems. [@problem_id:1709572]", "problem": "In the study of a model organism, *Synthetica morphogenes*, researchers have identified a mutation causing a complete failure of primary neurulation. This failure is traced to the median hinge point (MHP), where cells exhibit sporadic and asynchronous apical constrictions that are not sustained, preventing the coordinated tissue bending required to form the neural tube. To rescue this phenotype, you are tasked with designing a synthetic gene circuit that functions as a \"molecular ratchet.\" The goal is to create a system where a transient, asynchronous \"constriction-intent\" signal in an MHP cell triggers a brief pulse of apical constriction, which is then \"locked\" into a functionally constricted state by a permanent, localized increase in cell-cell adhesion. This ensures that even uncoordinated, transient constrictions contribute additively to the overall folding of the neural plate.\n\nYou have the following synthetic biological parts at your disposal:\n\n*   `gMyoII`: A gene encoding a hyperactive non-muscle myosin II light chain. Its protein product has a very short half-life and its expression robustly but transiently induces apical constriction.\n*   `gCdhH`: A gene encoding a novel high-affinity cadherin. Its protein product is very stable, and its surface expression significantly increases cell-cell adhesion strength.\n*   `gTF`: A gene encoding a stable transcriptional activator protein, `TF`.\n*   `pSignal`: A promoter that is activated by the endogenous, transient, and asynchronous \"constriction-intent\" signal present in MHP cells.\n*   `pTF`: A promoter that is strongly activated only by the binding of the transcription factor `TF`.\n\nUsing the notation `(Promoter) -> (Gene1, Gene2, ...)` to indicate that a promoter drives the expression of one or more genes, which of the following circuit architectures would correctly implement the desired molecular ratchet mechanism?\n\nA. `pSignal -> gMyoII, gCdhH`\n\nB. `pSignal -> gTF`\n   `pTF -> gMyoII, gCdhH, gTF`\n\nC. `pSignal -> gMyoII, gTF`\n   `pTF -> gCdhH`\n\nD. `pSignal -> gMyoII, gTF`\n   `pTF -> gCdhH, gTF`\n\nE. `pSignal -> gMyoII, gCdhH, gTF`\n   `pTF -> gTF`", "solution": "Define the transient, asynchronous endogenous input in median hinge point cells as $S(t)$ (the activity of `pSignal`), and let $M(t)$, $C(t)$, and $T(t)$ denote, respectively, the levels of MyoII, Cadherin, and the transcription factor TF. The design requirements are:\n- R1 (pulse): A transient $S(t)$ should produce a brief pulse of apical constriction, i.e., $M(t)$ should increase transiently and then rapidly decay; therefore `gMyoII` must not be under any self-sustaining control and should not be driven by `pTF`.\n- R2 (lock): The same transient $S(t)$ should be converted into a permanent, localized increase in adhesion, i.e., $C(t)$ should remain high after $S(t)$ has returned to baseline; therefore `gCdhH` should be maintained by a memory element that stays active after $S(t)$ is gone.\n- R3 (memory implementation): A standard way to implement memory is positive feedback on $T(t)$ so that `pTF` remains active after an initial seeding by $S(t)$, thereby maintaining `gCdhH` expression.\n\nThese requirements can be expressed by the following qualitative dynamical forms:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt}=\\alpha_{M} S(t)-\\delta_{M} M,\\quad \\delta_{M}\\ \\text{large (short half-life), with no \\text{pTF}-driven term},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt}=\\alpha_{T} S(t)+\\beta_{T} f(T)-\\delta_{T} T,\\quad \\beta_{T}>0\\ \\text{for TF auto-activation via \\text{pTF}},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt}=\\alpha_{C} f(T)-\\delta_{C} C,\\quad \\delta_{C}\\ \\text{small (very stable cadherin)},\n$$\nwhere $f(T)$ is the activation function for `pTF` by TF (e.g., a Hill function). With a transient $S(t)$ pulse, these equations implement a pulse in $M(t)$ (due to large $\\delta_{M}$ and lack of `pTF`-driven $M$ production) and a locked high $C(t)$ (due to sustained $T$ from positive feedback and stable $C$).\n\nEvaluate each option against R1–R3:\n\nA. `pSignal -> gMyoII, gCdhH`. Here $M$ and $C$ both track $S(t)$; $M$ pulses appropriately, and $C$ rises only during $S(t)$. Although $C$ protein is very stable ($\\delta_{C}$ small), there is no transcriptional memory; the lock relies solely on protein stability and will dilute with cell growth. This does not implement a gene-circuit ratchet with memory and is less robust than desired.\n\nB. `pSignal -> gTF`; `pTF -> gMyoII, gCdhH, gTF`. Once seeded, $T$ self-activates `pTF` and continuously drives `gMyoII`, violating R1 by producing sustained, not pulsed, constriction.\n\nC. `pSignal -> gMyoII, gTF`; `pTF -> gCdhH`. This gives a MyoII pulse (R1 satisfied) and places $C$ under `pTF`. However, without TF auto-activation, $T$ decays with rate $\\delta_{T}$, so `pTF` and thus $C$ expression fade after the transient, failing to provide a permanent transcriptional lock (R2, R3 not satisfied).\n\nD. `pSignal -> gMyoII, gTF`; `pTF -> gCdhH, gTF`. The transient $S(t)$ produces a MyoII pulse (since `gMyoII` is not under `pTF`) and seeds $T$. Then TF auto-activation ($\\beta_{T}>0$) keeps `pTF` on, sustaining `gCdhH` expression and maintaining high adhesion even after $S(t)$ ends, thereby implementing the desired molecular ratchet (R1–R3 all satisfied).\n\nE. `pSignal -> gMyoII, gCdhH, gTF`; `pTF -> gTF`. MyoII remains pulsed and TF self-activates, but `gCdhH` is not under `pTF`, so there is no transcriptional lock on adhesion; the stable protein helps but again lacks circuit-level memory, making TF feedback extraneous for the ratchet function.\n\nOnly D simultaneously ensures a transient MyoII pulse and a permanent, feedback-maintained increase in adhesion localized to cells that experienced the transient `pSignal`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1709572"}]}
