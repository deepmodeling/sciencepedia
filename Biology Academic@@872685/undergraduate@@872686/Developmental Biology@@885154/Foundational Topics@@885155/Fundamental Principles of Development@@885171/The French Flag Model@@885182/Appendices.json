The cell fate is determined according to the French flag model based on the local concentration of Patternin that each cell senses. The patterning rules are as follows:\n\n- **High** concentration of Patternin (near the source) induces a **Blue** cell fate.\n- **Intermediate** concentration of Patternin induces a **White** cell fate.\n- **Low or Zero** concentration of Patternin (far from the source) results in the default **Red** cell fate.\n\nCells perceive the Patternin signal through a specific cell-surface receptor known as the Patternin Receptor (PR). The binding of Patternin to PR is the necessary first step to trigger the intracellular signaling cascade that determines the cell's ultimate fate.\n\nConsider an experiment where a homozygous null mutation is introduced into the gene encoding the PR. This mutation results in the complete absence of functional PR protein on the surface of all cells within the developing tissue segment.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes best describes the pattern of cell fates you would expect to observe in this mutant larva's abdominal tissue segment?\n\nA.

These cells can differentiate into one of three distinct fates—Type Blue (B), Type White (W), or Type Red (R)—depending on the local concentration of a secreted signaling molecule called Morphogen X. The differentiation follows a set of rules based on concentration thresholds $T_B$ and $T_W$, where $T_B  T_W  0$.\n- If the concentration $C$ of Morphogen X is greater than $T_B$, the cell becomes Type Blue.\n- If $T_W  C \\le T_B$, the cell becomes Type White.\n- If $0  C \\le T_W$, the cell becomes Type Red.\n- If $C=0$, the cell remains naive (undifferentiated).\n\nInitially, a small, constant source of Morphogen X is placed at the position of cell #1. The morphogen diffuses down the array, establishing a stable, monotonically decreasing concentration gradient. This results in the formation of the classic \"French flag\" pattern: a band of Blue cells near the source, followed by a band of White cells, and finally a band of Red cells extending to the far end of the array.\n\nA new experiment is conducted. The morphogen source is removed from cell #1 and placed at the exact center of the array, at the position of cell #51. The system is allowed to reach a new steady state. Assuming the cells are plastic and respond to the new local morphogen concentrations, which of the following best describes the new pattern of cell fates along the array from cell #1 to cell #101?\n\nA. The new pattern is asymmetric. A Blue-White-Red sequence develops starting from the center and extending toward cell #101, while all cells from #1 to #50 become Type Red.\n\nB.

Specifically:\n- With a source at an end (original experiment), $C(x)$ decreases monotonically away from the source into the domain, producing a single sequence of thresholds crossed once each: first $CT_{B}$ (Blue), then $T_{W}C\\leq T_{B}$ (White), then $0C\\leq T_{W}$ (Red), consistent with the stated French flag pattern extending to the far end.\n- With a source at the center $x_{0}=L/2$ (new experiment), symmetry implies $C'(x_{0})=0$ and $C(x)$ depends only on $|x-x_{0}|$, strictly decreasing as $|x-x_{0}|$ increases. Therefore $C$ attains its maximum at the center and crosses each threshold $T_{B}$ and $T_{W}$ exactly twice at symmetric positions about the center.\n\nDefine the fate thresholds:\n- Blue where $C(x)T_{B}$,\n- White where $T_{W}C(x)\\leq T_{B}$,\n- Red where $0C(x)\\leq T_{W}$,\n- Naive only if $C(x)=0$.\n\nBecause $T_{B}T_{W}0$ and the centered profile is symmetric and decreasing away from the center, there exists a central interval around $x_{0}$ where $C(x)T_{B}$ (Blue band), flanked on both sides by regions where $T_{W}C(x)\\leq T_{B}$ (White bands), and farther out by regions near both ends where $0C(x)\\leq T_{W}$ (Red at both ends). In the original description, the far end under an end source remained Red rather than naive, indicating $C0$ across the entire array at steady state; by the same reasoning, with a central source the end cells have the lowest but positive concentration, thus Red rather than naive.\n\nThis yields a symmetric Blue-White-Red-White-Blue ordering centered at cell #51 when read from the center outward, which corresponds, when read from cell #1 to #101, to Red at both ends, flanked inward by White, with a central Blue band.\n\nOptions analysis:\n- A is inconsistent with the symmetry of the centered source in a homogeneous medium; the pattern must be symmetric, not asymmetric.\n- B is false because the steady-state concentration is not spatially uniform; diffusion with localized production and degradation produces a gradient.\n- C matches the derived symmetric pattern with a central Blue band, White flanks, and Red at both ends.\n- D requires a minimum at the center, which contradicts the centered-source maximum.\n- E contradicts the assumption that cells are plastic and respond to the new local concentrations; the new steady state determines fates without preserving the original asymmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1722142"}, {"introduction": "A key challenge for developmental patterning is ensuring that structures maintain correct proportions even when the overall tissue size varies, a property known as scale-invariance.
