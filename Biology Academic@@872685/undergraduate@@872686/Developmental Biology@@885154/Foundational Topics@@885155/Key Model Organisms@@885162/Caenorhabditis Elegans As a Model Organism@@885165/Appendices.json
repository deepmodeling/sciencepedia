In *C. elegans*, a simple yet powerful screen involves observing how worms move. This exercise asks you to connect a specific behavioral defect—uncoordinated movement—to a general class of gene functions, demonstrating how a phenotype can provide the first crucial clue about the underlying biology of the nervous system [@problem_id:1674169].", "problem": "In a genetic screen using the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans*, a researcher isolates a new mutant strain. The worms in this strain are viable and have a normal gross morphology, but they exhibit a distinct behavioral phenotype: their movement is jerky and irregular, a characteristic broadly described as \"uncoordinated.\" In *C. elegans* genetics, genes identified by this phenotype are typically given the designation *unc*. Based on this observation, which of the following functional classes of genes is most likely to be affected in this mutant?\n\nA. Genes essential for early embryonic axis formation, which determine the head-tail and dorsal-ventral orientation.\n\nB. Genes that regulate the timing of cell lineage progression, often called heterochronic genes.\n\nC. Genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis or structural integrity of the worm's outer cuticle.\n\nD. Genes whose products are components of the neuromuscular system, such as proteins in neurons or muscle cells.", "solution": "1) The observed phenotype is viable animals with normal gross morphology but with jerky, irregular movement broadly described as \"uncoordinated,\" which in Caenorhabditis elegans genetics corresponds to the classical \"Unc\" phenotype and the gene designation unc.\n\n2) In C. elegans, mutations in genes essential for early embryonic axis formation typically cause severe developmental defects and often embryonic or early larval lethality, not viable adults with isolated movement defects. Therefore, option A is unlikely.\n\n3) Heterochronic genes regulate the timing of cell lineage and stage-specific developmental events (e.g., precocious or retarded cell fates, altered alae formation). Their primary readouts are temporal patterning defects rather than isolated locomotion abnormalities. Therefore, option B is unlikely.\n\n4) Genes affecting the cuticle often produce distinct gross morphological phenotypes such as dumpy (dpy), roller (rol), blister (bli), or squat morphologies. While cuticle defects can influence movement, they usually alter body shape or surface structure, producing conspicuous morphological changes rather than normal gross morphology with solely uncoordinated movement. Therefore, option C is less consistent with the description.\n\n5) The canonical unc class encompasses genes whose products function in the neuromuscular system, including neuronal ion channels, synaptic vesicle cycle proteins, axon guidance molecules, neurotransmitter receptors, and muscle structural or contractile components. Mutations in these genes commonly yield viable animals with normal overall morphology but defective coordination and locomotion. Therefore, option D best matches the phenotype.\n\nConclusion: The most likely functional class is genes whose products are components of the neuromuscular system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1674169"}, {"introduction": "Once a mutant of interest is identified, the next step is often to analyze its genetic properties through controlled crosses. This practice problem simulates a standard outcross experiment, a cornerstone of *C. elegans* genetics used to confirm Mendelian inheritance and to \"clean\" the genetic background of a strain. By predicting the outcome of the cross, you will apply fundamental principles of recessive traits and segregation in the context of the worm's reproductive biology [@problem_id:1674133].", "problem": "A researcher is working with a *Caenorhabditis elegans* strain that has a recessive autosomal mutation, `ste-1`, causing a sterile phenotype at a restrictive temperature. The researcher wants to map this mutation and also create a strain with a \"cleaner\" genetic background, free of other potential unlinked mutations. The standard procedure for this is to perform an outcross. They begin by crossing `ste-1/ste-1` homozygous hermaphrodites with wild-type (N2 strain) males at a permissive temperature where the mutants are fertile. The resulting F1 generation of hermaphrodites, which appear phenotypically wild-type (i.e., they are fertile), are then moved to individual culture plates and allowed to self-fertilize at the restrictive temperature to produce an F2 generation.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome for the F2 generation and the method to identify the desired genotype?\n\nA. All F1 progeny are fertile. Upon self-fertilization, 100% of their F2 progeny will be sterile, as these F2s are the desired `ste-1/ste-1` animals.\n\nB. All F1 progeny are fertile. Upon self-fertilization, their F2 progeny will segregate in a ratio of 3 fertile to 1 sterile. The sterile F2 animals possess the `ste-1/ste-1` genotype.\n\nC. The F1 progeny will be 50% fertile and 50% sterile. The fertile F1s are selected for self-fertilization, and their F2 progeny will all be fertile.\n\nD. All F1 progeny are fertile. Upon self-fertilization, their F2 progeny will segregate in a ratio of 1 fertile to 3 sterile. The sterile F2 animals should be selected.\n\nE. All F1 progeny are sterile, indicating the mutation is dominant, and the initial hypothesis was incorrect. The experiment must be restarted.", "solution": "Let the wild-type allele be $A$ and the recessive mutation ste-1 be $a$. The mutation is autosomal recessive and causes sterility at the restrictive temperature.\n\nParental cross at permissive temperature: $aa$ hermaphrodites $\\times$ $AA$ males.\n- By Mendel’s laws, all F1 offspring receive one allele from each parent, yielding the uniform genotype $Aa$.\n- Phenotype of $Aa$ at the restrictive temperature is fertile (wild-type), because the mutation is recessive.\n\nThus all F1 are fertile heterozygotes $Aa$. Each F1 is moved to its own plate and allowed to self.\n\nF1 self-fertilization: $Aa \\times Aa$.\n- Gamete types from each parent: $A$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $a$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ (law of segregation).\n- F2 genotype probabilities (Punnett reasoning):\n  - $P(AA)=\\frac{1}{4}$,\n  - $P(Aa)=\\frac{1}{2}$,\n  - $P(aa)=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n- At the restrictive temperature, only $aa$ are sterile; both $AA$ and $Aa$ are fertile.\n\nTherefore, the F2 segregate as $3$ fertile to $1$ sterile, and the sterile F2 are precisely the desired $aa$ (i.e., ste-1/ste-1) genotype.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1674133"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analyzing existing mutations, modern developmental biology relies on tools that can intentionally disrupt gene function. This exercise compares two essential techniques: creating a permanent genetic null allele versus transiently silencing a gene with RNA interference (RNAi). By analyzing the difference in the resulting phenotypes, you will gain insight into the mechanistic distinction between a gene knockout and a knockdown, a crucial concept for experimental design and data interpretation in molecular genetics [@problem_id:1674160].", "problem": "In a developmental biology laboratory, a research team is studying the function of the gene `dpy-5` in the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*. Mutations in this gene are known to cause a \"Dumpy\" (Dpy) phenotype, where the worms are shorter and fatter than their wild-type counterparts. The team compares two methods of disrupting `dpy-5` function:\n\n1.  A strain of *C. elegans* carrying a **null allele** of the `dpy-5` gene. A null allele is a version of a gene that has been mutated to cause a complete loss of its normal function, meaning no functional DPY-5 protein is produced.\n\n2.  Wild-type *C. elegans* that have been subjected to **RNA interference (RNAi)**. RNAi is a cellular mechanism that uses small RNA molecules to target and degrade specific messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, thereby preventing their translation into protein. In this experiment, the RNAi is designed to target the `dpy-5` mRNA.\n\nUpon observation, the researchers note that the worms with the `dpy-5` null allele exhibit a very severe Dumpy phenotype. In contrast, the wild-type worms treated with `dpy-5` RNAi display a noticeably milder Dumpy phenotype.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this observed difference in phenotypic severity?\n\nA. RNAi-mediated degradation of mRNA is often incomplete, allowing for the translation of some residual functional protein, whereas a null allele results in a complete absence of the protein.\n\nB. The null allele creates a truncated, non-functional protein that actively interferes with other cellular processes, causing a more severe toxic effect than simply removing the protein via RNAi.\n\nC. The RNAi mechanism only functions in the worm's somatic cells, while the null allele affects both somatic and germline cells, leading to a more widespread defect.\n\nD. The presence of the null allele mutation triggers a robust genetic compensation response from a related gene, which over-corrects and worsens the phenotype, a response not triggered by RNAi.\n\nE. A null allele represents a permanent change in the DNA that is inherited in a dominant fashion, while RNAi is a transient effect that is recessive.", "solution": "The core mechanistic difference is between gene knockout and gene knockdown. By definition, a null allele of a gene produces no functional protein product, typically due to a deletion, frameshift, nonsense mutation, or other lesions that abolish expression or yield a transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Therefore, worms homozygous for a null allele of `dpy-5` have essentially zero DPY-5 function, producing the most severe phenotype consistent with complete loss of function.\n\nRNA interference, in contrast, operates at the mRNA level by promoting sequence-specific degradation and/or translational repression of the target transcript. In practice, RNAi is most often a knockdown rather than a knockout: its efficiency can be high but is rarely absolute across all cells, developmental stages, and tissues. Consequently, some residual `dpy-5` mRNA typically escapes silencing, permitting translation of a residual amount of functional DPY-5 protein. This residual activity yields a milder Dumpy phenotype compared with the complete absence of function in the null allele strain.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: it states the fundamental reason—RNAi often leaves residual protein whereas a null allele yields none.\n- B is incorrect: a null allele, by definition, does not produce an interfering dominant-negative product; such toxic effects are characteristic of antimorphs/dominant-negative alleles, not nulls.\n- C is incorrect or at least not the fundamental explanation: in C. elegans, RNAi can act in both soma and germline depending on delivery and gene; moreover, the observed somatic phenotype severity is best explained by incomplete knockdown, not germline restriction.\n- D is incorrect: genetic compensation, when it occurs, typically mitigates knockout phenotypes rather than worsening them; and over-compensation worsening severity is not a general rule.\n- E is incorrect: null alleles are generally recessive with respect to loss-of-function phenotypes, and the dominance/recessivity and permanence of the DNA change do not by themselves explain the acute within-generation severity difference compared to RNAi.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that RNAi often achieves incomplete depletion, leaving residual protein, whereas a null allele removes all functional protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1674160"}]}
