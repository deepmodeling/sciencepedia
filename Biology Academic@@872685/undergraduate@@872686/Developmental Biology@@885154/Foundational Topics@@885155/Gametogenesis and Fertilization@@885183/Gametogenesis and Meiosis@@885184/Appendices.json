This initial practice provides a foundational thought experiment to trace the fate of a single chromosome through spermatogenesis [@problem_id:1688908].

Using advanced genetic engineering techniques, the researcher labels a single copy of chromosome 4 in a male lab mouse. This specific labeled chromosome was inherited by the male mouse from its father. The researcher's goal is to determine the likelihood of this paternal chromosome being passed on to the next generation.\n\nAssuming that meiosis proceeds without errors such as non-disjunction, what is the probability that a single, randomly selected, mature sperm cell produced by this male mouse will contain the fluorescently labeled chromosome 4?\n\nSelect the correct probability from the options below.\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1/8\n\nC. 1/4\n\nD. 1/2\n\nE. 3/4\n\nF. 1", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a specific chromosome from a paternal source, present in a diploid male, is found in one of his mature sperm cells. To solve this, we must trace the chromosome through the process of spermatogenesis, specifically meiosis.\n\nLet's denote the labeled chromosome 4 (inherited from the father) as $C_{p}$ and the homologous, unlabeled chromosome 4 (inherited from the mother) as $C_{m}$. The male mouse's diploid germ-line cells, such as primary spermatocytes, contain one of each: the pair $(C_{p}, C_{m})$.\n\nThe process of meiosis consists of two main stages: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.\n\n**Step 1: Interphase before Meiosis I**\nBefore meiosis begins, the cell undergoes DNA replication. Each chromosome is duplicated, creating a structure composed of two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere.\n- The labeled chromosome $C_{p}$ replicates to form a structure consisting of two identical, labeled sister chromatids.\n- The unlabeled chromosome $C_{m}$ replicates to form a structure consisting of two identical, unlabeled sister chromatids.\n\n**Step 2: Meiosis I (Reductional Division)**\nDuring Meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and then segregate into two different cells. The key event is the separation of homologous chromosomes.\n- The primary spermatocyte, which is a diploid cell ($2n$), divides into two secondary spermatocytes, which are haploid ($n$) in terms of chromosome number, but each chromosome still consists of two chromatids.\n- The pair of homologous chromosomes $(C_{p}, C_{m})$ will separate. One secondary spermatocyte will receive the replicated, labeled chromosome $C_{p}$, and the other secondary spermatocyte will receive the replicated, unlabeled chromosome $C_{m}$.\n- The segregation is random, but in this process, one cell gets the entire paternal replicated chromosome, and the other gets the entire maternal replicated chromosome.\n\nSo, after Meiosis I, we have two cells:\n- 1 secondary spermatocyte with the replicated, labeled chromosome $C_{p}$.\n- 1 secondary spermatocyte with the replicated, unlabeled chromosome $C_{m}$.\n\n**Step 3: Meiosis II (Equational Division)**\nMeiosis II is similar to mitosis. The sister chromatids of each chromosome separate.\n- The secondary spermatocyte containing the replicated, labeled chromosome $C_{p}$ divides into two spermatids. Each spermatid receives one of the labeled sister chromatids. So, this division produces 2 spermatids containing $C_{p}$.\n- The secondary spermatocyte containing the replicated, unlabeled chromosome $C_{m}$ divides into two spermatids. Each spermatid receives one of the unlabeled sister chromatids. So, this division produces 2 spermatids containing $C_{m}$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion and Probability Calculation**\nFrom one primary spermatocyte entering meiosis, we obtain a total of four spermatids (which mature into sperm cells).\n- 2 of the 4 spermatids contain the labeled chromosome $C_{p}$.\n- 2 of the 4 spermatids contain the unlabeled chromosome $C_{m}$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that a single, randomly selected sperm cell contains the labeled chromosome. Since this outcome occurs in 2 out of the 4 possible products of a single meiotic event, the probability is:\n$$ P(\\text{sperm contains } C_{p}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of sperm with } C_{p}}{\\text{Total number of sperm produced}} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nThis is a direct consequence of Mendel's Law of Segregation at the chromosomal level. For any pair of homologous chromosomes, a gamete has an equal chance of receiving the paternal or the maternal chromosome.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $1/2$, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1688908"}, {"introduction": "While the idealized model of meiosis is precise, the biological process is subject to errors with significant consequences. This exercise explores one such error, nondisjunction, where chromosomes fail to separate correctly [@problem_id:1688927]. By analyzing the outcome of nondisjunction during meiosis I, you will gain insight into how aneuploid gametes—a leading cause of genetic disorders and miscarriages—can arise.", "problem": "In a male mouse, a single primary spermatocyte, which contains one X and one Y chromosome in addition to its autosomes, enters meiosis. A meiotic error occurs during anaphase of meiosis I, where the X and Y chromosomes fail to segregate to opposite poles. Instead, both the X and Y chromosomes are pulled to the same pole of the dividing cell. The resulting two secondary spermatocytes then proceed through a normal meiosis II, where sister chromatids separate as expected.\n\nWhich of the following describes the sex chromosome content of the four spermatids that result from this single, faulty meiotic event?\n\nA.

All four spermatids will contain both an X and a Y chromosome.\n\nE. One spermatid will contain an X chromosome, one will contain a Y chromosome, one will contain both an X and a Y chromosome, and one will contain no sex chromosomes.", "solution": "The problem describes a nondisjunction event during meiosis I involving the sex chromosomes of a primary spermatocyte. Let's trace the process step-by-step to determine the genetic content of the final four spermatids.\n\n**Step 1: The Starting Cell**\nThe process begins with a single primary spermatocyte. Before meiosis I, DNA replication occurs. Thus, this cell contains a set of duplicated autosomes, a duplicated X chromosome (composed of two sister chromatids), and a duplicated Y chromosome (composed of two sister chromatids). The key event of meiosis I is the separation of homologous chromosomes. In males, the X and Y chromosomes pair in a small region of homology and behave like a homologous pair during segregation.\n\n**Step 2: Nondisjunction in Meiosis I**\nIn a normal meiosis I, the X chromosome would segregate to one pole and the Y chromosome to the other. However, the problem states that nondisjunction occurs: both the X and Y chromosomes move together to the same pole. The opposite pole receives no sex chromosomes.\n\n**Step 3: Products of Meiosis I**\nAt the end of meiosis I, cytokinesis divides the primary spermatocyte into two secondary spermatocytes.\n- **Secondary Spermatocyte 1:** This cell formed from the pole that received both sex chromosomes. It will contain a complete set of duplicated autosomes, plus the duplicated X chromosome and the duplicated Y chromosome. Its sex chromosome content is XY. This cell is aneuploid.\n- **Secondary Spermatocyte 2:** This cell formed from the pole that received no sex chromosomes. It will contain a complete set of duplicated autosomes but will be nullisomic for the sex chromosomes (it has no X and no Y). Its sex chromosome content is 'O'. This cell is also aneuploid.\n\n**Step 4: Meiosis II**\nThe problem states that meiosis II proceeds normally for both secondary spermatocytes. Meiosis II is an equational division where sister chromatids separate.\n\n- **Division of Secondary Spermatocyte 1 (XY):** This cell enters meiosis II. The duplicated X and Y chromosomes align at the metaphase plate. During anaphase II, the sister chromatids of the X chromosome separate, and the sister chromatids of the Y chromosome separate. Cytokinesis then produces two spermatids. Each of these spermatids receives one X chromatid and one Y chromatid. Therefore, two spermatids with the sex chromosome constitution XY are produced.\n\n- **Division of Secondary Spermatocyte 2 (O):** This cell also enters meiosis II. It has no sex chromosomes to segregate. The sister chromatids of its autosomes separate normally. Cytokinesis results in two spermatids, each containing a set of autosomes but completely lacking a sex chromosome. Therefore, two spermatids with the sex chromosome constitution 'O' are produced.\n\n**Step 5: Final Outcome**\nCombining the products from both divisions in meiosis II, the single initial primary spermatocyte has produced a total of four spermatids:\n- Two spermatids with the sex chromosome constitution XY.\n- Two spermatids with the sex chromosome constitution O (no sex chromosome).\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option A. Option B describes a normal meiotic division. Option C describes a possible outcome of nondisjunction during meiosis II. Options D and E are inconsistent with the mechanisms of meiotic division.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1688927"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to think like an experimental biologist by dissecting the components of meiotic division.

For this mammal, a diploid somatic cell is described as having a chromosome number of $2n$ and a DNA content of $2C$. The isolated primary spermatocyte has already undergone DNA replication in preparation for meiosis.\n\nJust before the cell enters Meiosis I, it is exposed to a high concentration of a drug that completely blocks cytokinesis by disrupting actin filament function. However, the drug has no effect on the processes of nuclear division (karyokinesis), such as spindle formation and chromosome segregation.\n\nAssuming the cell is viable and proceeds through both meiotic divisions (Meiosis I and Meiosis II) under the continuous influence of this drug, which of the following options correctly describes the final product(s) at the conclusion of Meiosis II?\n\nA.

Therefore, nuclear divisions proceed normally, but the cytoplasm does not divide.\n\nIn Meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles. This reduces chromosome number per nucleus while sister chromatids remain together; thus each daughter nucleus becomes haploid in chromosome number but still has duplicated chromatids. Therefore, after Meiosis I (with cytokinesis blocked), there is a single large cell containing two distinct nuclei, each with\n$$\nn, 2C\n$$\n\nIn Meiosis II, sister chromatids separate within each nucleus.
