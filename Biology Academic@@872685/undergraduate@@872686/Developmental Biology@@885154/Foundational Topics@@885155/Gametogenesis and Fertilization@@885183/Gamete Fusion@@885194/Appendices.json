This is often complicated by functional redundancy, where multiple genes or proteins can perform similar tasks. This practice uses a classic genetic approach—comparing single and double gene knockouts—to untangle the roles of two critical oocyte proteins, CD9 and CD81, in sperm-egg fusion. By analyzing hypothetical in vitro fertilization data [@problem_id:1688671], you will quantify the degree to which one protein can compensate for the absence of the other, a fundamental concept in developmental genetics.", "problem": "A developmental biology research team is investigating the functional relationship between two tetraspanin proteins, CD9 and CD81, which are crucial for sperm-egg fusion in mammals. To explore the possibility of functional redundancy, the team employs the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to generate mouse oocytes with specific gene knockouts. These oocytes are then subjected to in vitro fertilization assays with wild-type sperm, and the percentage of successfully fertilized eggs is recorded for each experimental group.\n\nThe experimental data are as follows:\n- **Group 1 (Wild-Type Control):** Wild-type oocytes showed a fertilization efficiency of 97.5%.\n- **Group 2 (CD9 Knockout):** Oocytes lacking the CD9 gene (CD9-KO) showed a fertilization efficiency of 22.4%.\n- **Group 3 (CD81 Knockout):** Oocytes lacking the CD81 gene (CD81-KO) showed a fertilization efficiency of 89.1%.\n- **Group 4 (Double Knockout):** Oocytes lacking both CD9 and CD81 genes (DKO) showed a fertilization efficiency of 1.7%.\n\nTo quantify the degree of functional compensation, you are asked to calculate the \"Compensatory Function Score\" of CD81.

A key molecular player in this process is the oocyte membrane receptor Juno, which is essential for sperm binding. Immediately following the first successful sperm-oocyte fusion event at time $t=0$, a cellular signaling cascade triggers the rapid internalization and removal of Juno receptors from the oocyte's surface.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this process. Let $N(t)$ be the number of functional Juno receptors on the oocyte surface at time $t$. At $t=0$, the number of receptors is $N_0$. The rate of removal of these receptors is directly proportional to the number of receptors currently present on the surface, with a first-order rate constant $k$.\n\nFor a second sperm to successfully bind and fuse, the number of available Juno receptors must be above a critical threshold, $N_c$, where $N_0 \\gt N_c \\gt 0$.
