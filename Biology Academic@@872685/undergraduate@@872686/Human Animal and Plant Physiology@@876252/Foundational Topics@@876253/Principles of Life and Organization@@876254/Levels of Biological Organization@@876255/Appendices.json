The bundle is known to contain two distinct populations of myelinated axons: fast-conducting A-fibers and slow-conducting C-fibers. A single electrical stimulus is applied at one end of the isolated nerve bundle, and the resulting compound action potential is measured by a recording electrode placed at a distance $L$ from the stimulus point.\n\nThe conduction velocity of the A-fibers is $v_A = 85.0$ m/s, and that of the C-fibers is $v_C = 1.50$ m/s. The duration of the action potential passing the electrode is determined by the repolarization phase. For this nerve, the repolarization can be modeled as the discharge of the membrane's capacitance. The duration of the recorded signal for a single action potential is defined as being equal to 3 times the membrane's repolarization time constant.\n\nA novel neurotoxin, Achronotoxin, is introduced, which completely and specifically blocks all voltage-gated potassium channels, leaving only the passive leak channels to facilitate repolarization. The membrane capacitance per unit area, $C_m$, is $1.00 \\times 10^{-2}$ F/m². The effective membrane resistance per unit area due to leak channels alone, $R_{\\text{leak}}$, is $6.00$ Ω·m².\n\nFor the two signals to be distinguished (or \"resolved\") at the recording electrode, the arrival of the peak of the C-fiber signal must occur after the entire signal from the A-fiber has passed the electrode.\n\nCalculate the minimum length $L_{min}$ of the nerve bundle segment, in meters, for the two signals to be resolvable after the application of the Achronotoxin.

This exercise forces you to move beyond the properties of individual cells and consider how their structural organization is the critical factor that enables tissue-level function.", "problem": "A bioengineering team is tasked with creating a functional cardiac tissue patch *in vitro* capable of generating coordinated, directional contractions. Their protocol involves the following steps:\n\n1.  A hydrogel scaffold is synthesized from purified type I collagen, resulting in an isotropic, porous network.\n2.  Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are seeded at a high density onto the surface of this hydrogel scaffold.\n3.  The seeded construct is submerged in a culture medium rich in glucose, amino acids, and essential ions, and supplemented with a cocktail of growth factors known to promote cardiomyocyte survival and proliferation.\n4.  The construct is incubated at 37°C in a standard cell culture incubator for three weeks. The team observes that individual hiPSC-CMs, and small, isolated clusters of cells, begin to beat spontaneously but the patch as a whole fails to produce a uniform, wave-like contraction.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most fundamental reason for the failure to achieve coordinated, tissue-level contraction in this engineered construct?\n\nA. The culture medium, while promoting survival, lacks specific signaling molecules required to initiate spontaneous beating in cardiomyocytes.\n\nB. The absence of cardiac fibroblasts in the coculture prevents the deposition of a mature and complex extracellular matrix (ECM).\n\nC. The isotropic nature of the collagen scaffold fails to provide topographical cues for cell alignment, which is a prerequisite for the formation of an electrical syncytium capable of propagating a unified action potential.\n\nD. The high density of the cardiomyocytes leads to rapid depletion of oxygen and nutrients in the center of the construct, creating a necrotic core and disrupting tissue integrity.\n\nE. The three-week culture period is insufficient for the hiPSC-CMs to mature their contractile machinery (sarcomeres) to a level required for forceful contraction.", "solution": "Objective: Identify the most fundamental reason the engineered patch fails to produce a coordinated, tissue-level contraction given the described protocol.\n\nStep 1: Define the necessary biophysical prerequisites for coordinated, tissue-level contraction.\n- Coordinated contraction requires that cardiomyocytes form an electrically coupled syncytium capable of propagating a coherent action potential wavefront across macroscopic length scales. This depends on:\n  (i) sufficient cell-cell electrical coupling via gap junctions (e.g., connexin 43),\n  (ii) low-resistance, continuous conduction pathways across the tissue,\n  (iii) structural anisotropy and cellular alignment so that conduction velocity is higher along a principal axis, enabling directional, wave-like propagation.\n- In excitable media theory and cardiac cable theory, macroscopic action potential propagation speed $v$ is governed by the effective tissue conductivity (diffusive coupling) and the membrane time constants, typically expressed as $v \\propto \\sqrt{D/\\tau}$, where $D$ is an effective diffusion coefficient reflecting intercellular coupling and tissue microstructure, and $\\tau$ is a characteristic membrane time constant. In anisotropic myocardium, $D$ is a tensor, and $v$ differs along and across the fiber axis, with $v_{\\parallel} > v_{\\perp}$. Sustained, directional propagation at the tissue level requires coherent alignment so that a continuous high-conductivity path exists over long distances.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the construct’s key design features and observed phenotype against these prerequisites.\n- The scaffold is an isotropic, porous type I collagen hydrogel. Isotropy implies no preferred direction of topographical or mechanical cues for cellular alignment. Without such cues, hiPSC-CMs attach and spread with random orientations, producing a mosaic of short, misaligned fiber tracts rather than long, continuous, low-resistance conduction pathways.\n- The observed phenotype—spontaneous beating of individual cells and small, isolated clusters—indicates intrinsic automaticity of hiPSC-CMs is intact, and local coupling within microclusters may exist, but long-range, tissue-level conduction fails to synchronize the entire patch. This is the hallmark consequence of lacking structural alignment needed to organize an electrical syncytium over macroscopic scales.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option against the mechanism above to identify the most fundamental cause.\n- Option A: Incorrect. hiPSC-CMs exhibit spontaneous automaticity due to pacemaker currents; spontaneous beating is already observed. The medium does not need special initiators for beating, and the phenotype falsifies this option.\n- Option B: Partially relevant but not fundamental. Cardiac fibroblasts can aid ECM remodeling, mechanical integrity, and signal modulation; however, hiPSC-CM-only monolayers on anisotropic substrates routinely achieve coordinated propagation. The essential missing element here is not fibroblasts per se, but alignment cues that enable coherent conduction.\n- Option C: Correct. The isotropic scaffold fails to provide topographical cues necessary for global cardiomyocyte alignment. Without alignment, the effective conductivity tensor lacks a coherent principal axis across the tissue, preventing formation of a robust electrical syncytium and unified action potential propagation. In terms of conduction physics, random orientation reduces the effective long-range $D$ along any single axis, thereby reducing $v$ and promoting wavebreaks and desynchronization.\n- Option D: Not the most fundamental. While nutrient and oxygen gradients can cause central necrosis in thick constructs, the scenario describes cells seeded on the surface of a porous hydrogel and does not report necrosis as a dominant finding. Moreover, nutrient limitations would cause cell death and discontinuity, but the observed asynchronous local beating is better explained by absent alignment and insufficient long-range coupling, not primarily by a necrotic core.\n- Option E: Not the most fundamental. hiPSC-CMs may be immature at three weeks and produce weak force, but coordinated propagation does not strictly require full sarcomere maturation. Many studies show immature hiPSC-CMs can exhibit synchronized monolayer contractions if alignment and coupling are provided. The failure mode here is spatial coordination rather than force magnitude.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.\n- The most fundamental reason is the lack of anisotropic alignment cues in the isotropic collagen scaffold, preventing formation of an aligned, electrically coupled syncytium capable of supporting unified, directional wavefront propagation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2299862"}, {"introduction": "Understanding biological organization allows us to build quantitative models that scale from the molecular level to the entire organism.
