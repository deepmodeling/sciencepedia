Its cardiovascular system can be modeled with the following resting-state parameters: a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of $100$ mmHg and a total cardiac output (CO) of $2.50$ L/min. For this model, we simplify the systemic circulation into three parallel vascular beds: the skeletal muscles, the splanchnic circulation (digestive organs), and a composite \"rest of body\" compartment. At rest, the blood flow is distributed as follows: $20.0\\%$ of the cardiac output perfuses the skeletal muscles, $25.0\\%$ perfuses the splanchnic circulation, and the remaining $55.0\\%$ perfuses the \"rest of body\" compartment.\n\nSuddenly, the gazelle spots a lion in the distance. This visual stimulus triggers a powerful, anticipatory feedforward response via the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the animal for intense physical exertion (fleeing) *before* any movement occurs. This response elicits the following instantaneous changes:\n1. The cardiac output doubles from its resting value.\n2. The vascular resistance of the skeletal muscle bed decreases to $40.0\\%$ of its resting value.\n3. The vascular resistance of the splanchnic circulation triples.\n4. The vascular resistance of the \"rest of body\" compartment remains unchanged.\n\nAssuming the relationship between mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance (TPR) is given by $MAP = CO \\times TPR$, and that resistances in parallel sum reciprocally, calculate the gazelle's new mean arterial pressure during this anticipatory state.

We can model the membrane of one such cell as a simple electrical circuit with a characteristic membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$. The cell maintains a stable resting potential, $V_{rest}$. For the trap to snap shut, the cell's membrane potential must reach or exceed a threshold potential, $V_{th}$, which triggers an action potential.\n\nA single, brief mechanical stimulation of a trigger hair causes an influx of ions. This event can be modeled as an instantaneous increase in the membrane potential by an amount $V_{stim}$. By itself, this first stimulus is sub-threshold, meaning the potential immediately after the stimulus is still below $V_{th}$. Following this instantaneous increase, the membrane potential, $V(t)$, begins to relax exponentially back towards the resting potential.
