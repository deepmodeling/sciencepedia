These vesicles are also spherical, each with a uniform radius of $r$. Assume that $r$ is much smaller than $R$.

This exercise shifts our focus to endocytosis, the process of bringing material into the cell, and the specific machinery required to form a vesicle. Using a thought experiment based on real-world cell biology techniques, you will deduce the function of the crucial protein dynamin by predicting the effect of a specific molecular inhibitor, gaining insight into how scientists dissect complex cellular pathways [@problem_id:1757393].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the cellular uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, a process known to rely on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In an experiment, a culture of fibroblast cells is incubated with a medium containing LDL. For the experimental group, the cells are pre-treated with GTP-gamma-S (GTPγS), a synthetic analog of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) that can bind effectively to GTP-binding proteins but is resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis into Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP). The biologist then uses transmission electron microscopy to observe the ultrastructure of the plasma membrane in these treated cells.\n\nAssuming the GTPγS has successfully entered the cells and is active in the cytosol, which of the following observations is the most likely consequence of the compound's effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis?\n\nA. The plasma membrane appears abnormally smooth, with a significant reduction in the number of clathrin-coated pits, indicating a failure in the initial assembly of the endocytic coat.\n\nB. Numerous clathrin-coated vesicles are observed freely diffusing in the cytoplasm, but they fail to shed their clathrin coats, leading to their accumulation.\n\nC. Transferrin receptors and their bound LDL cargo cluster correctly on the cell surface, but the plasma membrane fails to invaginate to form a pit.\n\nD. Deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits are seen in large numbers, but they remain tethered to the plasma membrane by a narrow stalk and fail to detach as free vesicles.\n\nE. The rate of LDL uptake is unaffected, as the primary energy-requiring steps of vesicle formation and scission depend on the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), not GTP.", "solution": "The key mechanistic premise is that GTP$\\gamma$S is a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog: it binds to GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) and prevents the transition from the GTP-bound (active) state to the GDP-bound (inactive) state because hydrolysis $\\mathrm{GTP} \\to \\mathrm{GDP} + \\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ cannot occur. In clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane, the essential GTPase whose hydrolysis is required for vesicle scission is dynamin. Dynamin assembles into a helical collar around the neck of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits and utilizes the free energy from GTP hydrolysis to drive membrane fission.\n\nTherefore, if GTP hydrolysis on dynamin is blocked by GTP$\\gamma$S, dynamin will remain in the GTP-bound state and continue to assemble at the neck but will be unable to execute the conformational changes and mechanochemical steps associated with scission. The predicted ultrastructural phenotype is an accumulation of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits that remain connected to the plasma membrane by a narrow neck (or stalk), often with prominent dynamin collars, i.e., scission failure at the last step.\n\nEvaluating the options against this mechanism:\n- Option A (smooth membrane with reduced coated pits) implies a failure of coat initiation/assembly. Coat nucleation and AP2/clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane are governed primarily by cargo, phosphoinositides (notably $\\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$), and adaptors; they do not require GTP hydrolysis. GTP$\\gamma$S would not be expected to reduce coated pit initiation.\n- Option B (coated vesicles that fail to uncoat) describes an uncoating defect. Uncoating requires the ATP-dependent chaperone Hsc70 with auxilin; it depends on ATP, not GTP. Blocking GTP hydrolysis would not specifically cause failure to shed clathrin coats.\n- Option C (cargo clustering but failure to invaginate) suggests a defect in curvature generation/coat assembly, not a scission block. This is not the canonical consequence of inhibiting dynamin’s GTP hydrolysis.\n- Option D (deeply invaginated coated pits tethered by a narrow stalk, failing to detach) matches the established effect of preventing dynamin-mediated scission by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis with nonhydrolyzable analogs like GTP$\\gamma$S.\n- Option E (rate unaffected; only ATP matters) is incorrect because dynamin’s scission is a GTP-dependent step; thus, GTP hydrolysis is essential and is specifically inhibited by GTP$\\gamma$S.\n\nHence, the most likely observation is the accumulation of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits that fail to pinch off as free vesicles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1757393"}, {"introduction": "Cells are masters of homeostasis, constantly balancing opposing processes to maintain stability, a concept known as the 'membrane budget'.
