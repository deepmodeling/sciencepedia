The primary determinants of compatibility are the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, which are inherited in blocks from our parents. This first exercise invites you to apply fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics to calculate the likelihood of finding a \"perfect\" HLA match between siblings, providing a quantitative basis for understanding the challenges of donor selection. [@problem_id:1723904]", "problem": "In human genetics, the major histocompatibility complex is a set of genes that code for cell surface proteins essential for the immune system. In humans, this complex is referred to as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system. The primary HLA genes are located in a cluster on chromosome 6. Due to their close physical proximity, these genes are typically inherited together as a single block known as a haplotype. Each person inherits one haplotype from their mother and one from their father.\n\nFor a successful organ transplant, it is highly desirable for the donor and recipient to have identical HLA genotypes, which is referred to as a \"perfect match\". Consider a family where the parents are genetically unrelated and, for the purposes of this problem, possess four entirely distinct HLA haplotypes. That is, the mother has two unique haplotypes, and the father has two unique haplotypes, with no haplotypes shared between the parents.\n\nAssuming straightforward Mendelian inheritance and no chromosomal crossover events within the HLA gene cluster, what is the probability that two full siblings within this family will be perfect HLA matches for one another? Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let the mother carry two distinct HLA haplotypes $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, and the father carry two distinct haplotypes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$. Under Mendelian inheritance without crossover within the HLA cluster, each child independently inherits one maternal haplotype and one paternal haplotype, with\n$$\nP(\\text{inherit } M_{1})=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(\\text{inherit } M_{2})=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(\\text{inherit } P_{1})=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(\\text{inherit } P_{2})=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThus, a child’s HLA genotype can be represented as the pair $(M_{i},P_{j})$ with $i,j\\in\\{1,2\\}$, and each of the four combinations occurs with probability\n$$\nP\\big((M_{i},P_{j})\\big)=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nTwo full siblings are a perfect HLA match if and only if they inherit the same maternal haplotype and the same paternal haplotype. Conditioning on the first sibling’s genotype, the probability that the second sibling matches the maternal haplotype is\n$$\nP(\\text{match maternal})=\\frac{1}{2},\n$$\nand independently, the probability that the second sibling matches the paternal haplotype is\n$$\nP(\\text{match paternal})=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nBy independence of maternal and paternal transmissions,\n$$\nP(\\text{perfect HLA match})=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, enumerating the four equally likely genotypes $(M_{1},P_{1}), (M_{1},P_{2}), (M_{2},P_{1}), (M_{2},P_{2})$, the probability that two siblings have the same genotype is\n$$\n\\sum_{g} P(G_{1}=g)P(G_{2}=g)=4\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nExpressed as a decimal, this probability is $0.25$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.25}$$", "id": "1723904"}, {"introduction": "While HLA matching is paramount, other immunological barriers can lead to immediate and catastrophic graft failure. The ABO blood group system, familiar from blood transfusions, is also critically important in solid organ transplantation because these antigens are expressed on the blood vessels of the graft. This practice problem presents a stark hypothetical scenario to explore the mechanism of hyperacute rejection, a powerful antibody-mediated response that occurs when pre-existing antibodies in the recipient recognize and attack the donor organ.

T-cells can recognize foreign tissue through two main pathways: direct and indirect allorecognition. The following problem uses the elegant scenario of a \"domino transplant\" to illustrate the potency of the direct pathway, where immune cells from the donor graft itself directly trigger a massive response from the recipient's T-cells, explaining the universal need for potent immunosuppressive drugs. [@problem_id:1723897]", "problem": "In a sophisticated surgical procedure known as a \"domino transplant,\" a patient with cystic fibrosis (Patient A), who possesses a healthy heart but diseased lungs, receives a heart-lung bloc from a deceased organ donor. Subsequently, Patient A's own healthy heart is transplanted into a second individual (Patient B), who suffers from end-stage heart disease. The cells of the heart transplanted into Patient B are therefore from a living donor, Patient A. Despite the viability and health of the transplanted heart, Patient B must undergo a lifelong regimen of full immunosuppressive therapy to prevent organ rejection.\n\nCentral to the immune response against foreign tissue is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), a set of cell surface proteins that display antigens to immune cells. Rejection is driven by the recipient's T-lymphocytes recognizing the donor's MHC molecules as foreign. This recognition can occur through different mechanisms.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most critical and immunologically potent reason why Patient B requires full immunosuppression to prevent acute rejection of the heart from Patient A?\n\nA. Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) belonging to the recipient (Patient B) engulf proteins shed from the surface of the new heart's cells, process them into peptides, and present these foreign peptides on their own MHC molecules to activate other cells of Patient B's immune system.\n\nB. The recipient (Patient B) has pre-existing natural antibodies that immediately bind to the endothelial lining of the transplanted heart's blood vessels, triggering a cascade that destroys the graft within minutes to hours.\n\nC. Professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) that originated from the heart donor (Patient A) and are resident within the transplanted heart tissue (so-called \"passenger leukocytes\") migrate into Patient B's lymphoid tissues and directly present their intact, foreign MHC molecules to Patient B's T-lymphocytes.\n\nD. The heart tissue, having been in Patient A's body, retains an immunological memory of the initial deceased donor's antigens, effectively presenting a composite of two different foreign signatures to Patient B's immune system.\n\nE. Though the heart is phenotypically healthy, its cells express minor, non-MHC proteins specific to Patient A's genetic background related to the cystic fibrosis condition, which are sufficient to trigger a massive inflammatory response in Patient B.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the principal immunologic driver of acute allograft rejection. The central mechanism is T-lymphocyte recognition of donor $MHC$ molecules. There are two major pathways: direct allorecognition (recipient T cells recognize intact, allogeneic $MHC$:peptide complexes on donor professional APCs that accompany the graft, often termed passenger leukocytes) and indirect allorecognition (recipient APCs process donor proteins and present donor-derived peptides on self $MHC$ to recipient T cells). Direct allorecognition is quantitatively and qualitatively the most potent stimulus early after transplant and is the principal driver of acute cellular rejection.\n\nStep 2: Apply to the domino transplant scenario. Patient B receives a heart from Patient A, who is allogeneic to Patient B. The transplanted heart contains donor-derived professional APCs from Patient A (passenger leukocytes). These APCs migrate to Patient B’s secondary lymphoid organs and directly stimulate Patient B’s naive T cells via donor $MHC$:peptide complexes. This direct pathway elicits robust activation and clonal expansion of alloreactive T cells, necessitating full immunosuppression to prevent acute rejection.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option against the known mechanisms and their relative potency and relevance.\n\n- Option A describes indirect allorecognition (recipient APCs present donor peptides on self $MHC$). While real and important, it is generally less potent early and is more associated with chronic rejection. Not the most critical reason for acute rejection in this context.\n\n- Option B describes hyperacute rejection mediated by preformed antibodies (e.g., anti-ABO or anti-HLA), which destroys the graft within minutes to hours. This is prevented by ABO compatibility and crossmatch testing and is not the rationale for lifelong immunosuppression post-engraftment. Also, the question focuses on the T-cell response to $MHC$, not pre-existing antibodies.\n\n- Option C describes direct allorecognition by donor passenger leukocytes presenting their allogeneic $MHC$ to recipient T cells. This is the most potent mechanism for early acute rejection and the primary reason full immunosuppression is required.\n\n- Option D posits that the heart retains an immunological memory of the deceased donor’s antigens. This is immunologically incorrect; graft parenchyma does not carry forward “memory” of prior antigenic exposures in a way that would augment rejection in a new host.\n\n- Option E invokes minor histocompatibility antigens or disease-specific proteins. While minor antigens can contribute to rejection, they are significantly less potent than $MHC$ mismatches and do not constitute the principal reason for the need for full immunosuppression in acute rejection risk.\n\nStep 4: Conclude. The most critical and immunologically potent reason for Patient B’s need for full immunosuppression is direct allorecognition mediated by donor-derived passenger leukocytes, as described in Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1723897"}]}
