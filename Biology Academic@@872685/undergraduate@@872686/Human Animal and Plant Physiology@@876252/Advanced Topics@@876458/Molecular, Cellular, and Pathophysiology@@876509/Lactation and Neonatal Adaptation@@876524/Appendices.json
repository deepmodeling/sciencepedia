This exercise [@problem_id:1714988] delves into the critical first step of nutrient processing: enzymatic digestion in the small intestine.

The lack of glucose and galactose absorption from the milk leads to severe hypoglycemia, which in turn disrupts the normal neurological control of gut motility and secretion.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct physiological explanation for the symptoms of congenital lactase deficiency in a newborn consuming milk. Let's break down the normal process of lactose digestion and then analyze what goes wrong in this condition.\n\n**Step 1: Normal Lactose Digestion**\nLactose is a large disaccharide molecule composed of two smaller monosaccharides: glucose and galactose. For the body to absorb these sugars for energy, lactose must first be broken down. This enzymatic breakdown, or hydrolysis, is performed by the enzyme lactase, which is located in the brush border of the epithelial cells lining the small intestine. The resulting glucose and galactose are then actively transported across the intestinal wall into the bloodstream.\n\n**Step 2: Pathophysiology of Lactase Deficiency**\nIn congenital lactase deficiency, the gene for producing lactase is defective, and the enzyme is absent from the small intestine. Consequently, when the newborn consumes milk, the lactose cannot be hydrolyzed into glucose and galactose. It therefore remains as an intact disaccharide and cannot be absorbed.\n\n**Step 3: Consequences of Undigested Lactose**\nThe undigested lactose continues its passage through the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to two major, interconnected consequences that explain the observed symptoms:\n\n1.  **Osmotic Effect:** The unabsorbed lactose molecules increase the solute concentration (osmolarity) of the fluid within the intestinal lumen. According to the principle of osmosis, water moves from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration across a semipermeable membrane. The intestinal lining acts as such a membrane. Therefore, water is drawn from the body's tissues and bloodstream into the intestinal lumen. This excess water in the gut leads to loose, watery stools, known as osmotic diarrhea.\n\n2.  **Bacterial Fermentation:** When the undigested lactose reaches the large intestine (colon), it encounters a vast population of commensal bacteria. These bacteria readily use the lactose as a food source, metabolizing it through anaerobic fermentation. This fermentation process produces various byproducts, including gases (like hydrogen, $H_2$; carbon dioxide, $CO_2$; and methane, $CH_4$) and short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetic acid, butyric acid). The production of gas causes the abdominal bloating and flatulence (gas). The short-chain fatty acids can further contribute to the osmotic load and lower the pH of the colon, which can irritate the intestinal lining.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\nNow, let's evaluate the given choices based on this understanding.\n\n*   **A. Lactose directly irritates the lining of the large intestine, triggering an inflammatory response and the hypersecretion of water.** This is incorrect. While the acidic byproducts of fermentation can be irritating, lactose itself is not a primary irritant. The diarrhea is primarily osmotic, not secretory (caused by hypersecretion).\n*   **B. The absence of lactase prevents the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose, causing the undigested disaccharide to remain in the intestinal lumen where it is fermented by colonic bacteria and creates an osmotic gradient.** This statement is correct and comprehensive. It accurately identifies the root cause (failure of hydrolysis due to enzyme absence) and the two direct consequences (osmotic effect and bacterial fermentation) that together produce all the symptoms described (diarrhea, bloating, and gas).\n*   **C. The accumulation of lactose in the stomach significantly slows gastric emptying, leading to a feeling of fullness and bloating as the primary cause.** This is incorrect. The primary problem with lactose occurs in the small and large intestines, not the stomach. While severe intestinal distress can secondarily affect gastric motility, it is not the initiating cause.\n*   **D. Increased absorption of intact lactose molecules into the bloodstream causes a systemic allergic reaction that manifests as gastrointestinal distress.** This is incorrect. The fundamental problem is the *lack* of absorption. Very little, if any, intact lactose is absorbed. This option incorrectly describes the pathophysiology as an allergy rather than an enzyme deficiency.\n*   **E. The lack of glucose and galactose absorption from the milk leads to severe hypoglycemia, which in turn disrupts the normal neurological control of gut motility and secretion.** This is incorrect. While chronic malnutrition from untreated lactase deficiency can eventually lead to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), this is a downstream consequence, not the direct cause of the immediate gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating and diarrhea. The gut symptoms are the cause of the poor nutrient absorption, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the most accurate and central explanation for the pathophysiology of congenital lactase deficiency.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1714988"}, {"introduction": "One of the most dramatic physiological events in a mammal's life is the transition from fetal to extrauterine circulation at birth.

For the brief period of transition considered, you can assume that the infant's overall metabolic rate and the efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange remain constant.\n\nCalculate the change in the femoral arterial oxygen saturation (defined as the final saturation minus the initial saturation) that occurs immediately following the complete functional closure of the ductus arteriosus.
