This first practice challenges you to act as a field biologist and classify an animal's energy-saving behavior based on observed physiological data [@problem_id:1754786]. Mastering this skill is crucial for accurately interpreting the diverse ways animals adapt to their environments.", "problem": "A team of wildlife biologists is studying a newly discovered species of small, non-migratory mammal found in a temperate forest ecosystem. This ecosystem experiences warm, resource-abundant summers and cold, resource-scarce winters. Using implantable physiological loggers, the team collects data on the animal's metabolic rate and core body temperature throughout the year.\n\nThe data reveals two distinct patterns of heterothermy:\n1.  During the summer, the animal consistently undergoes a state of reduced metabolic activity and lowered body temperature for a period of 4 to 6 hours each day, usually during the mid-day inactive period. By late afternoon, its physiology returns to normal active levels.\n2.  During the winter, the animal enters a state of profound metabolic suppression, with its core body temperature dropping to within a few degrees of the ambient burrow temperature. These states last for several days at a time and are punctuated by brief, energy-intensive arousal periods where the animal's body temperature returns to its normal homeostatic set point for less than a day before another long bout of suppression begins.\n\nBased on these specific physiological patterns, which of the following classifications most accurately describes the energy-saving strategies employed by this species?\n\nA. The animal exhibits only hibernation.\n\nB. The animal exhibits only aestivation.\n\nC. The animal exhibits both hibernation and daily torpor.\n\nD. The animal exhibits both aestivation and daily torpor.\n\nE. The animal exhibits only daily torpor.", "solution": "Identify the physiological categories using standard definitions of heterothermy. Daily torpor is characterized by short, typically diurnal bouts lasting hours, with reversible reductions in metabolic rate and core body temperature within the same day, routinely repeating on a daily cycle. Hibernation is characterized by prolonged, multiday to multiweek bouts of profound metabolic suppression with core body temperature approaching ambient, punctuated by brief arousals lasting less than a day before re-entry into torpor. Aestivation is summer dormancy typically associated with hot or arid conditions and occurs over extended periods (days to weeks), not as a predictable daily pattern.\n\nMap observations to definitions. The summer pattern—4 to 6 hours of reduced metabolism and lowered body temperature during the mid-day inactive period with full return to active physiology by late afternoon—matches daily torpor. The winter pattern—several-day bouts of profound metabolic suppression with core body temperature within a few degrees of burrow ambient, interrupted by brief arousals—matches hibernation.\n\nExclude alternatives. The animal does not exhibit only hibernation (summer data show daily torpor), only aestivation (summer changes are daily and brief, not prolonged summer dormancy), or only daily torpor (winter data show classic hibernation). The combination of aestivation and daily torpor is incorrect because the prolonged winter bouts are hibernation, not aestivation.\n\nTherefore, the classification most consistent with the data is that the species exhibits both hibernation and daily torpor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1754786"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify a state like hibernation, the next step is to quantify its effectiveness. The immense energy savings of torpor are a key to survival, but just how significant are they? This problem allows you to perform a fundamental calculation in metabolic physiology: determining the fractional reduction in metabolic rate from direct oxygen consumption data [@problem_id:1754797]. This exercise provides a tangible sense of the profound metabolic suppression that makes long-term survival possible in harsh conditions.", "problem": "An ecophysiologist is studying the energy-saving strategies of a small mammal, the Arctic ground squirrel (*Urocitellus parryii*), during its winter hibernation. The metabolic rate of an animal can be reliably estimated by measuring its rate of oxygen consumption. During a study, the physiologist finds that an active, euthermic (warm-bodied) ground squirrel has a resting metabolic rate corresponding to an oxygen consumption of 21.8 ml of O$_2$ per gram of body mass per hour. When the same animal enters deep torpor (hibernation), its body temperature drops significantly, and its metabolic rate plummets. In this state, the measured oxygen consumption is only 0.35 ml of O$_2$ per gram of body mass per hour.\n\nCalculate the fractional reduction in the metabolic rate of the Arctic ground squirrel when it transitions from its active, resting state to its deep torpor state. Express your answer as a decimal, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Define the resting (active) metabolic rate per mass and time as $r_{a}$ and the torpid metabolic rate as $r_{t}$. Given $r_{a} = 21.8$ and $r_{t} = 0.35$ in consistent units, the fractional reduction $f$ is defined as the relative decrease from the initial value:\n$$\nf = \\frac{r_{a} - r_{t}}{r_{a}} = 1 - \\frac{r_{t}}{r_{a}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nf = \\frac{21.8 - 0.35}{21.8} = \\frac{21.45}{21.8} = \\frac{429}{436} \\approx 0.983945.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is:\n$$\n0.984.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.984}$$", "id": "1754797"}, {"introduction": "Animals do not enter hibernation randomly; specific environmental cues trigger this dramatic physiological shift. But how can we determine which cue is the primary driver when multiple factors, like falling temperatures and dwindling food, occur simultaneously? This final practice puts you in the role of an experimental scientist, asking you to analyze data from a controlled study to disentangle the effects of different environmental triggers [@problem_id:1754832]. It is a classic example of how to use the scientific method to draw robust conclusions about cause and effect in biology.", "problem": "A team of biologists is investigating the environmental cues that trigger hibernation in garden dormice (*Eliomys quercinus*). They hypothesize that the primary triggers are either a decrease in ambient temperature, a reduction in food availability, or a combination of both. To test this, they set up a controlled experiment with four groups of dormice, each housed under different conditions for a period of 12 weeks. The conditions and the observed percentage of animals entering a state of deep hibernation in each group were recorded as follows:\n\n*   **Group 1 (Control):** Maintained at a constant warm temperature (20°C) with an abundant and continuous food supply. Result: 0% of the animals entered hibernation.\n*   **Group 2 (Cold Temperature):** Maintained at a constant cold temperature (5°C) with an abundant and continuous food supply. Result: 75% of the animals entered hibernation.\n*   **Group 3 (Food Limitation):** Maintained at a constant warm temperature (20°C) with a severely restricted food supply. Result: 5% of the animals entered hibernation.\n*   **Group 4 (Combined Cues):** Maintained at a constant cold temperature (5°C) with a severely restricted food supply. Result: 85% of the animals entered hibernation.\n\nBased solely on the results of this experiment, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. Decreasing ambient temperature is the primary environmental cue for inducing hibernation, while food availability has a minor, secondary role.\n\nB. Diminishing food supply is the primary environmental cue for inducing hibernation, with temperature playing a supporting role.\n\nC. Both decreasing temperature and diminishing food supply are equally important and necessary triggers for hibernation.\n\nD. Hibernation is induced only by the simultaneous presence of both low temperature and limited food.\n\nE. Garden dormice will not hibernate if food is abundant, regardless of the ambient temperature.", "solution": "Define the binary variables: $T=1$ for cold temperature and $T=0$ for warm temperature; $F=1$ for restricted food and $F=0$ for abundant food. Let $H$ denote entry into deep hibernation. The observed conditional probabilities (converting percentages to decimals) are:\n$$\nP(H\\mid T=0,F=0)=0,\\quad P(H\\mid T=1,F=0)=0.75,\\quad P(H\\mid T=0,F=1)=0.05,\\quad P(H\\mid T=1,F=1)=0.85.\n$$\nAssess the effect of temperature when food is abundant: changing $T$ from $0$ to $1$ at $F=0$ increases $P(H)$ from $0$ to $0.75$, an absolute change of $0.75$. Assess the effect of food when temperature is warm: changing $F$ from $0$ to $1$ at $T=0$ increases $P(H)$ from $0$ to $0.05$, an absolute change of $0.05$. When temperature is cold, adding food restriction changes $P(H)$ from $0.75$ to $0.85$, an absolute change of $0.10$. Thus, the temperature cue exerts a large primary effect, whereas food restriction alone has a minor effect and modestly augments the temperature effect.\n\nEvaluate the options against the data:\n- Statement A predicts a strong primary effect of temperature with a smaller contribution of food; this matches the observed large increase with cold at abundant food ($0.75$) and the small increases attributable to food restriction ($0.05$ at warm, $0.10$ at cold).\n- Statement B is inconsistent, because if food restriction were primary, $P(H\\mid T=0,F=1)$ would be high, but it is $0.05$.\n- Statement C is false because temperature alone yields a high $P(H)$ ($0.75$), so both cues are not equally necessary.\n- Statement D is false because cold alone induces hibernation in many animals ($0.75$ at $F=0$).\n- Statement E is false because with abundant food but cold temperature, many animals hibernate ($0.75$).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that decreasing ambient temperature is the primary cue, with food availability exerting a minor, secondary effect, consistent with statement A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1754832"}]}
