The animals are placed in a controlled environmental chamber where the temperature is varied, and their resting metabolic rate is measured as the rate of oxygen consumption. The following observations are recorded:\n\nFor **Species X**, the resting metabolic rate is at its lowest when the ambient temperature is maintained between $28^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $32^\\circ\\text{C}$. When the temperature is lowered from this range to $10^\\circ\\text{C}$, the metabolic rate increases substantially. Similarly, when the temperature is raised from this range to $40^\\circ\\text{C}$, the metabolic rate also shows a notable increase.\n\nFor **Species Y**, the resting metabolic rate is extremely low at an ambient temperature of $10^\\circ\\text{C}$. As the temperature is steadily increased to $40^\\circ\\text{C}$, the metabolic rate is observed to increase consistently, following a curve that approximates an exponential rise.\n\nGiven that one of these species is a small placental mammal (a field mouse) and the other is a small squamate reptile (a garter snake), which of the following statements correctly identifies the species?\n\nA. Species X is the field mouse, and Species Y is the garter snake.\n\nB. Species X is the garter snake, and Species Y is the field mouse.\n\nC.

The provided data is insufficient to distinguish between a mammal and a reptile.", "solution": "Let $T_{a}$ denote the ambient temperature and $M$ denote the resting metabolic rate (rate of oxygen consumption).\n\nFirst, consider an endotherm (a small placental mammal such as a field mouse). Endotherms defend a relatively constant body temperature $T_{b}$ and exhibit a thermoneutral zone (TNZ), an interval of $T_{a}$ over which resting metabolism is minimal. Within the TNZ,\n$$\nM = M_{\\text{basal}}.\n$$\nBelow the lower critical temperature $T_{\\text{lc}}$ of the TNZ, heat loss increases, and the endotherm elevates metabolism to generate heat. A standard heat-balance model gives an approximately linear increase in resting metabolism with the thermal gradient:\n$$\nM = M_{\\text{basal}} + C\\,(T_{b} - T_{a}), \\quad \\text{for } T_{a} < T_{\\text{lc}},\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the thermal conductance. Above the upper critical temperature $T_{\\text{uc}}$, additional energetic costs arise for active heat dissipation (such as panting or sweating), yielding\n$$\nM > M_{\\text{basal}}, \\quad \\text{for } T_{a} > T_{\\text{uc}}.\n$$\nTherefore, an endotherm shows a U-shaped relation: $M$ is minimal within a moderate $T_{a}$ range (the TNZ) and increases when $T_{a}$ is lowered well below or raised well above that range.\n\nNow consider an ectotherm (a small squamate reptile such as a garter snake). Ectotherms do not maintain $T_{b}$ metabolically; instead, their metabolic rate reflects temperature-dependent biochemical kinetics. A common description is an Arrhenius-type dependence:\n$$\nM(T) = A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $T$ is absolute temperature, $E_{a}$ is an activation energy, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $A$ is a pre-exponential factor. Over ecological temperature ranges, this is often summarized by a $Q_{10}$ relationship:\n$$\nM(T) = M(T_{0})\\, Q_{10}^{\\frac{T - T_{0}}{10}},\n$$\nwith $Q_{10} > 1$, implying a monotonic, approximately exponential increase of $M$ with $T$. Consequently, at low $T_{a}$ (for example, near 10 degrees on a Celsius scale), $M$ is extremely low, and as $T_{a}$ increases toward warmer values (for example, toward 40 degrees), $M$ increases steeply.\n\nMatch the observations to these principles. Species X shows a minimal metabolic rate between 28 and 32 degrees, with substantial increases both when cooled to 10 degrees and when warmed to 40 degrees. This is the hallmark of an endotherm with a TNZ bracketed by lower and upper critical temperatures. Species Y shows extremely low metabolism at 10 degrees and a consistent, approximately exponential rise as $T_{a}$ increases to 40 degrees, which is the hallmark of an ectotherm governed by temperature-dependent biochemical kinetics.\n\nTherefore, Species X is the mammal (field mouse), and Species Y is the reptile (garter snake). This identification rules out options B, C, D, and contradicts E, since the data are sufficient to distinguish endothermy from ectothermy.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1890909"}, {"introduction": "While endothermy allows for activity across a wide range of temperatures, this independence comes at a steep energetic price.
