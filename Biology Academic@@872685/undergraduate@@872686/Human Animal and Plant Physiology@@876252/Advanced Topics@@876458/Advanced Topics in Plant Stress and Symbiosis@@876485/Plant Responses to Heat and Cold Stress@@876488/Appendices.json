Strawberry: Intracellular ice crystal formation ruptures organelles.", "solution": "We identify the relevant biophysical mechanisms for low-temperature injury by distinguishing chilling injury (above the freezing point of cellular water) from freezing injury (below the freezing point).\n\nFor the banana at $5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- The temperature is above $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, so liquid water persists in cells and ice crystals do not form under normal conditions.\n- Tropical species such as banana are chilling-sensitive. The primary mechanism is chilling injury, where membrane lipids undergo a phase transition from a liquid-crystalline to a gel state as temperature falls below the lipid’s transition temperature. This reduces membrane fluidity, disrupts membrane protein function (including ion pumps and channels), and increases permeability, causing ion leakage and impaired transport. Therefore, the correct mechanism for the banana is loss of membrane fluidity with resultant leakage and transport impairment.\n\nFor the strawberry at $-5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- The temperature is below $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, so freezing occurs. In temperate, frost-adapted plants, the typical and adaptive response is extracellular ice formation in the apoplast. Ice has a lower water potential than liquid water, so a chemical potential gradient drives water efflux from the symplast to the apoplast, leading to cellular dehydration and plasmolysis. This extracellular freezing-induced dehydration is the primary mechanism of freezing injury in frost-hardy tissues; intracellular ice formation is generally catastrophic and is usually avoided in such species unless conditions are extreme or cooling is too rapid.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Options that invoke ice formation in the banana at $5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (A, C) are incorrect.\n- Options that invoke intracellular ice as primary in the strawberry (E) are inconsistent with frost tolerance mechanisms; the primary mechanism is extracellular ice and dehydration.\n- Metabolic explanations (D) are not the primary biophysical causes of the observed damage under these temperatures.\n\nThus, the most accurate pair is: banana—membrane fluidity loss and leakage; strawberry—extracellular ice formation causing severe cellular dehydration, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733933"}, {"introduction": "Plants are not passive victims of their environment; they actively regulate their internal state using complex signaling networks. This practice focuses on the pivotal role of the hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA) in orchestrating the response to combined heat and drought stress. By comparing a normal plant to a mutant that cannot produce ABA, you can isolate this hormone's function in controlling water loss through stomata, a key survival strategy [@problem_id:1733952].", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to investigate a plant's physiological response to environmental stress. Two groups of a particular plant species are used. The first group consists of wild-type plants with normal physiological functions. The second group consists of a mutant strain, designated `aba2`, which has a genetic defect rendering it incapable of synthesizing the plant hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA). Both groups are initially grown in identical, optimal conditions with adequate water and a constant ambient temperature of $22^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\nAt the start of the experiment, both groups of plants are subjected to simultaneous abiotic stresses: irrigation is stopped to induce drought stress, and the ambient temperature is raised and maintained at $38^\\circ\\text{C}$ to induce heat stress. The rate of transpirational water loss is then monitored for both the wild-type and the `aba2` mutant plants.\n\nBased on the established physiological role of ABA in mediating plant responses to stress, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the experimental outcome?\n\nA. The `aba2` mutant will exhibit a significantly lower rate of water loss compared to the wild-type plant.\n\nB. The wild-type plant will exhibit a significantly lower rate of water loss compared to the `aba2` mutant.\n\nC. Both the wild-type and the `aba2` mutant will exhibit nearly identical high rates of water loss, as ABA is primarily involved in seed dormancy, not stomatal regulation.\n\nD. Both the wild-type and the `aba2` mutant will exhibit nearly identical low rates of water loss, as other hormones will compensate for the lack of ABA.\n\nE. The rate of water loss will increase in the wild-type plant but decrease in the `aba2` mutant.", "solution": "ABA is the primary hormonal mediator of stomatal closure under water deficit and thermal stress. When water availability declines, wild-type plants rapidly synthesize ABA in vascular tissues and guard cells. ABA triggers guard-cell signaling (including activation of anion channels, efflux of $\\text{K}^{+}$ and anions, loss of turgor), which closes stomata and lowers stomatal conductance $g_{s}$. This directly reduces transpirational water loss.\n\nA standard relation for leaf transpiration rate is\n$$\nE = g_{s} \\cdot D,\n$$\nwhere $E$ is transpirational water loss per leaf area, $g_{s}$ is stomatal conductance to water vapor, and $D$ is the leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit. Raising the ambient temperature from 22 degrees Celsius to 38 degrees Celsius increases $D$, thereby tending to increase $E$. Simultaneously stopping irrigation induces drought, which in wild-type plants elevates ABA and lowers $g_{s}$, tending to decrease $E$. The net effect in wild type under combined drought and heat is a marked ABA-driven decrease in $g_{s}$ that counteracts the temperature-driven increase in $D$, yielding a significantly reduced $E$ compared to a plant that cannot close stomata effectively.\n\nIn the aba2 mutant, ABA biosynthesis is defective. Under drought and heat, $D$ still increases, but the mutant cannot mount the ABA-dependent reduction in $g_{s}$. As a result, $g_{s}$ remains relatively high (aside from slower, non-ABA-dependent effects), and thus $E$ remains high. Therefore, the aba2 mutant will lose water faster than the wild type under these stresses.\n\nHence, the wild-type plant will have a significantly lower rate of water loss compared to the aba2 mutant. This eliminates option A (reversed), option C (incorrectly denies ABA’s stomatal role), option D (other hormones do not compensate sufficiently for ABA’s central role in stomatal closure), and option E (incorrect directionality for both genotypes).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733952"}, {"introduction": "Predicting agricultural productivity in a warming world requires integrating multiple physiological processes that respond differently to temperature. This final practice introduces a quantitative source-sink model to explore how a heatwave can affect carbohydrate allocation and, ultimately, fruit yield.

They develop a simplified source-sink model to predict how the plant allocates carbohydrates under different thermal conditions. The model considers three key temperature-dependent processes: carbohydrate production via photosynthesis (the source), carbohydrate transport via the phloem (the delivery system), and the demand from reproductive tissues like flowers and fruits (the primary sink).\n\nThe relative rate of each process as a function of temperature, $T$, in degrees Celsius is described by a parabolic function:\n$$f(T; T_{\\text{opt}}, W) = \\max\\left(0, 1 - \\left(\\frac{T - T_{\\text{opt}}}{W}\\right)^2\\right)$$\nwhere $T_{\\text{opt}}$ is the optimal temperature for the process and $W$ is a parameter representing the width of the thermal tolerance range.\n\nThe model parameters for *Solanum prodigiosum* are as follows:\n1.  **Relative Photosynthetic Source Strength**, $S(T) = f(T; T_{\\text{opt,S}}, W_S)$, with $T_{\\text{opt,S}} = 31^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $W_S = 16^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n2.  **Relative Phloem Transport Efficiency**, $E(T) = f(T; T_{\\text{opt,E}}, W_E)$, with $T_{\\text{opt,E}} = 26^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $W_E = 14^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n3.  **Relative Reproductive Sink Strength**, $R(T) = f(T; T_{\\text{opt,R}}, W_R)$, with $T_{\\text{opt,R}} = 23^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $W_R = 7^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\nThe vegetative structures (leaves, stems, roots) represent a competing sink. For simplicity, its sink strength, $V_s$, is assumed to be constant with a relative value of $V_s = 1.2$.\n\nThe total flux of carbohydrates available for partitioning to the sinks is given by the product of the source strength and transport efficiency, $J(T) = S(T) \\times E(T)$. This available flux is partitioned between the reproductive and vegetative sinks based on their relative strengths.
