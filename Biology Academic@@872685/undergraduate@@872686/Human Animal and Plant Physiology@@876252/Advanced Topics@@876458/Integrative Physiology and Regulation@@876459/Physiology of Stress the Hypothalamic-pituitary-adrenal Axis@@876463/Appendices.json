In a healthy individual, the hypothalamus secretes Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH). ACTH then travels through the bloodstream to the adrenal cortex, prompting it to secrete cortisol, the primary stress hormone. Cortisol, in turn, exerts negative feedback on both the hypothalamus and the pituitary, regulating its own production.\n\nA patient suffering from a severe autoimmune disorder is prescribed a long-term, high-dose oral regimen of dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid that mimics the action of cortisol.

The dexamethasone suppression test is a powerful tool used to evaluate the integrity of the HPA axis, but interpreting its results requires sharp physiological reasoning.

In a normal state, the hypothalamus releases Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH). ACTH then travels through the bloodstream to the adrenal glands, stimulating them to produce and release cortisol. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone, exerts negative feedback on both the hypothalamus and the pituitary, inhibiting the release of CRH and ACTH to maintain homeostasis.\n\nDexamethasone is a potent synthetic glucocorticoid that mimics the negative feedback effect of cortisol but is not measured by standard cortisol assays. The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate the function of the HPA axis. In this test, a small dose of dexamethasone is administered to an individual at night, and their plasma cortisol level is measured the following morning.\n\nConsider two individuals undergoing this test:\n1. A healthy individual with a normally functioning HPA axis.\n2. A patient with Cushing's disease, a condition specifically caused by a pituitary tumor (adenoma) that autonomously secretes ACTH and is less sensitive to glucocorticoid negative feedback than normal pituitary tissue.\n\nBased on the physiological principles of the HPA axis, predict the expected outcome of the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test for these two individuals.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected morning cortisol levels?\n\nA.

The HPA axis operates with negative feedback: hypothalamic CRH stimulates pituitary ACTH, which stimulates adrenal cortisol secretion; cortisol inhibits both CRH and ACTH release to maintain homeostasis.\n2. Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that engages the same negative feedback receptors as cortisol but is not detected by standard cortisol assays. Therefore, effective feedback from dexamethasone lowers endogenous ACTH and thus lowers endogenous cortisol.\n3. In a healthy individual, low-dose dexamethasone activates glucocorticoid receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, suppressing CRH and ACTH. With reduced ACTH drive, adrenal cortisol production decreases, so the morning cortisol shows significant suppression.\n4. In Cushing disease due to a pituitary adenoma, ACTH secretion is relatively autonomous and less sensitive to glucocorticoid negative feedback compared with normal corticotrophs. Consequently, low-dose dexamethasone does not adequately suppress ACTH from the adenoma, so adrenal cortisol production remains elevated, and the morning cortisol does not show significant suppression.\n5. Therefore, the healthy subject shows significant suppression, while the patient with Cushing disease shows no significant suppression with low-dose dexamethasone, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1730136"}]}
