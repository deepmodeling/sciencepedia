This first practice provides a straightforward exercise in quantifying this decline by modeling the age-related decrease in the adrenal hormone Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). By using a simplified linear model, we can calculate an average rate of change, offering a clear, quantitative perspective on how physiological systems can be analyzed over a lifespan [@problem_id:1729667].", "problem": "In the study of human aging, the decline of certain hormones is a well-documented phenomenon. One such hormone is Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal steroid that serves as a precursor to sex hormones. In a typical human, circulating DHEA levels reach their maximum concentration around age 25. Subsequently, these levels begin a gradual decline. By age 75, the concentration of DHEA has fallen to approximately 20% of its peak value observed at age 25.\n\nAssuming a linear model for this decline from age 25 to 75, calculate the average annual decrease in DHEA concentration, expressed as a fraction of the peak concentration.

This practice explores the clinically important concept of sarcopenic obesity, where muscle mass is lost and fat mass is gained, often without a significant change in total body weight.
