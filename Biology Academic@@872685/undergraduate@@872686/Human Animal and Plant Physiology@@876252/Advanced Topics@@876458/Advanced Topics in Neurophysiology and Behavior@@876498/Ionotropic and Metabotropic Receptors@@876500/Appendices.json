By applying a technique called voltage-clamp, we can measure the flow of ions through a receptor's channel at different membrane potentials.

To characterize the receptor's function, a voltage-clamp experiment is performed on the postsynaptic neuron. The neuron is known to have a stable resting membrane potential of -70 mV and an action potential threshold of -50 mV. The experiment reveals that when the novel neurotransmitter is applied, the resulting postsynaptic current reverses its direction at a membrane potential of +5 mV. This value is determined to be the reversal potential ($E_{rev}$) for the synapse.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following provides the most accurate functional classification of this postsynaptic receptor?\n\nA. Inhibitory and likely permeable to only K⁺ ions.\n\nB. Excitatory and likely permeable to only Na⁺ ions.\n\nC. Inhibitory and likely permeable to only Cl⁻ ions.\n\nD.

This practice explores a more subtle but powerful mechanism known as shunting inhibition. You will analyze a scenario where a receptor's activation brings the membrane potential to a level that is technically a depolarization but still acts to prevent the neuron from firing, highlighting the importance of the relationship between a channel's equilibrium potential and the action potential threshold [@problem_id:1714462].", "problem": "In the central nervous system, a neuron at rest has a typical membrane potential ($V_{\\text{rest}}$) of -70 mV and a threshold potential ($V_{\\text{th}}$) of -55 mV required to fire an action potential. Consider a scenario where a neurotransmitter binds to an ionotropic receptor on the postsynaptic membrane of this neuron. This specific receptor is exclusively permeable to chloride ions ($Cl^-$). The equilibrium potential for chloride ions ($E_{\\text{Cl}}$) in this neuron is -65 mV.\n\nWhen this receptor is activated, it generates a small, localized change in the postsynaptic membrane potential. This change is classified as either an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP), which makes the neuron more likely to fire an action potential, or an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP), which makes the neuron less likely to fire an action potential.\n\nBased on the provided values, which of the following statements correctly describes the resulting event?\n\nA. An EPSP, because the influx of $Cl^-$ ions will depolarize the membrane.\n\nB. An EPSP, because the efflux of $Cl^-$ ions will depolarize the membrane.\n\nC. An IPSP, because the influx of $Cl^-$ ions will hyperpolarize the membrane.\n\nD. An IPSP, because the resulting membrane potential is held below the action potential threshold, and the increased conductance shunts excitatory currents.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the nature of the postsynaptic potential generated by opening chloride channels on a neuron with specific properties. We need to analyze the movement of chloride ions ($Cl^-$) and its effect on the neuron's ability to reach the action potential threshold.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the electrochemical driving force on $Cl^-$ ions.**\nThe direction of ion flow through an open channel is determined by the electrochemical driving force, which is the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the ion's equilibrium potential ($E_{ion}$). The formula for the driving force is $V_m - E_{ion}$. A positive driving force on a cation or a negative driving force on an anion results in an outward current (efflux). A negative driving force on a cation or a positive driving force on an anion results in an inward current (influx).\n\nThe neuron is initially at its resting membrane potential, so $V_m = V_{\\text{rest}} = -70$ mV.\nThe equilibrium potential for chloride is given as $E_{\\text{Cl}} = -65$ mV.\n\nThe driving force on $Cl^-$ is:\n$$ \\text{Driving Force} = V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}} = (-70 \\text{ mV}) - (-65 \\text{ mV}) = -5 \\text{ mV} $$\n\nSince $Cl^-$ is an anion (negatively charged) and the driving force is negative, the chloride ions will move out of the cell. This is an efflux of chloride ions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the effect of ion movement on the membrane potential.**\nThe efflux of negative charges ($Cl^-$ ions) from the cell makes the inside of the cell less negative relative to the outside. This change in potential is a depolarization. The membrane potential will move from its resting value of -70 mV towards the equilibrium potential of chloride, -65 mV.\nSo, the activation of the receptor causes a small depolarization from -70 mV towards -65 mV.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the postsynaptic potential as an EPSP or an IPSP.**\nAn Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) brings the membrane potential closer to the action potential threshold ($V_{\\text{th}} = -55$ mV), making it easier to fire an action potential.\nAn Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP) makes it more difficult for the neuron to reach the threshold. This can happen in two ways:\n1.  **Hyperpolarization**: The membrane potential becomes more negative, moving further away from the threshold.\n2.  **Shunting Inhibition**: The membrane potential is stabilized at a value below the threshold. The opening of the channels increases the membrane's conductance, so any excitatory current that arrives is \"shunted\" or diverted through these open channels, making it much less effective at depolarizing the membrane to threshold.\n\nIn this case, the membrane depolarizes from -70 mV towards -65 mV. While this is a depolarization, the new potential (-65 mV) is still more negative than the threshold potential (-55 mV). The opening of these $Cl^-$ channels effectively \"clamps\" or stabilizes the membrane potential near -65 mV. If a simultaneous EPSP tried to depolarize the neuron towards the -55 mV threshold, the open $Cl^-$ channels would provide a low-resistance pathway for current to leak out, counteracting the depolarization. This effect is known as shunting inhibition. Because the overall effect is to make the neuron *less* likely to fire an action potential, the event is functionally classified as an IPSP.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n- **A. An EPSP, because the influx of $Cl^-$ ions will depolarize the membrane.** This is incorrect. The ion movement is an efflux, not an influx.\n- **B. An EPSP, because the efflux of $Cl^-$ ions will depolarize the membrane.** This correctly identifies the ion movement (efflux) and the immediate voltage change (depolarization). However, it incorrectly classifies the event as an EPSP because it ignores the functional context of the action potential threshold and the principle of shunting inhibition.\n- **C. An IPSP, because the influx of $Cl^-$ ions will hyperpolarize the membrane.** This is incorrect. The ion movement is an efflux, and it causes depolarization, not hyperpolarization.\n- **D. An IPSP, because the resulting membrane potential is held below the action potential threshold, and the increased conductance shunts excitatory currents.** This is the correct and most complete explanation. It correctly identifies the event as an IPSP and provides the accurate reason based on the principle of shunting inhibition, which is the key concept in this scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1714462"}, {"introduction": "Receptors can be thought of as modular machines, with distinct parts for binding a ligand and for transducing a signal. This thought experiment invites you to predict the function of a novel, genetically engineered chimeric receptor built from the parts of both an ionotropic and a metabotropic receptor. By determining the outcome of this fusion, you will reinforce your understanding of the core functional domains that define these two major receptor classes and distinguish their unique signaling mechanisms [@problem_id:1714482].", "problem": "In a neurobiology laboratory, researchers are investigating the modular nature of synaptic receptors. They genetically engineer a novel chimeric receptor intended for expression in a line of cultured neurons. These neurons have a resting membrane potential of -65 mV and are placed in a standard physiological saline solution.\n\nThe engineered chimeric receptor is constructed as follows:\n- The extracellular ligand-binding domain is taken from an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, which is an ionotropic glutamate receptor that normally functions as a ligand-gated ion channel permeable to $Na^+$ and $K^+$ ions.\n- The seven-transmembrane helical domain and the intracellular loops are taken from a type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1). The mGluR1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that, upon binding glutamate, activates a Gq-type G-protein. This activation subsequently stimulates the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PIP_2$) into the second messengers inositol trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nThe researchers successfully express this chimeric receptor in the cultured neurons, which do not endogenously express any other type of glutamate receptor. They then apply glutamate to the extracellular solution bathing the neurons. Which of the following options most accurately describes the initial and primary signaling event that will occur within the neuron immediately following glutamate binding to the chimeric receptor?\n\nA. A rapid influx of $Na^+$ into the cell, causing a fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).\n\nB. Activation of a Gq protein, leading to the enzymatic production of $IP_3$ and DAG.\n\nC.

A rapid efflux of $K^+$ from the cell, causing a transient hyperpolarization.\n\nF. No significant intracellular response will occur, as the disparate domains from ionotropic and metabotropic receptors are functionally incompatible.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the signaling outcome of a genetically engineered chimeric receptor. The key to solving this is to understand the modular functions of receptor domains: the extracellular domain determines ligand specificity, while the transmembrane and intracellular domains determine the signal transduction mechanism.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the structure of the chimeric receptor.\nThe receptor has two main parts derived from different parent receptors:\n- **Ligand-binding domain:** From an AMPA receptor. AMPA receptors are glutamate receptors. Therefore, the chimeric receptor will bind the neurotransmitter glutamate. The binding of glutamate will cause a conformational change in the entire receptor protein.\n- **Transmembrane and intracellular domains:** From an mGluR1 receptor. These domains are responsible for transducing the signal inside the cell. The problem states that mGluR1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that couples to a Gq-type G-protein.\n\nStep 2: Determine the consequence of glutamate binding.\nWhen glutamate binds to the extracellular AMPA-derived domain, the induced conformational change is propagated to the transmembrane and intracellular domains. Since these domains belong to mGluR1, they will behave as mGluR1 domains would upon activation. They will not form an ion channel pore, as that structural component is part of the AMPA receptor's transmembrane domain, which is absent in the chimera.\n\nStep 3: Trace the intracellular signaling pathway.\nThe activated mGluR1-derived intracellular domains will interact with their cognate signaling partner, which is the Gq-type G-protein. This interaction activates the Gq protein. The activated alpha subunit of the Gq protein (Gαq) then dissociates and activates its downstream effector enzyme, phospholipase C (PLC). PLC, in turn, hydrolyzes the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PIP_2$) into two second messengers: inositol trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n- **A. A rapid influx of $Na^+$ into the cell, causing a fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).** This is the characteristic function of a complete, native AMPA receptor. Our chimeric receptor lacks the ion channel pore of the AMPA receptor, so this cannot occur. This option is incorrect.\n- **B. Activation of a Gq protein, leading to the enzymatic production of $IP_3$ and DAG.** This matches our derived signaling cascade perfectly. Glutamate binding activates the receptor, which then activates Gq, leading to PLC activation and the production of $IP_3$ and DAG. This option is correct.\n- **C. Binding of the receptor to intracellular calmodulin, leading to the activation of CaMKII.** This pathway is typically downstream of calcium influx or calcium release from intracellular stores (which can be an effect of $IP_3$), but it is not the primary signaling event directly initiated by the receptor itself. This option is incorrect.\n- **D. Direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by the receptor, resulting in an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels.** The cAMP pathway is initiated by Gs (stimulatory) or Gi (inhibitory) G-proteins, not by the Gq protein that mGluR1 couples to. This option describes a different GPCR pathway. This option is incorrect.\n- **E. A rapid efflux of $K^+$ from the cell, causing a transient hyperpolarization.** While some GPCRs can modulate $K^+$ channels (e.g., via Gβγ subunits activating G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying potassium channels, or GIRKs), the primary and defining pathway for Gq is through PLC. Also, the primary ligand-gated function of the AMPA receptor involves $Na^+$ influx more significantly than $K^+$ efflux in causing depolarization, not hyperpolarization. This option is incorrect.\n- **F. No significant intracellular response will occur...** This suggests the chimera would be non-functional. However, the modularity of protein domains is a well-established principle, and such chimeric receptors are powerful tools in research, demonstrating that different domains can indeed be swapped to create novel functionalities. It is expected that the ligand binding will successfully trigger the intracellular cascade. This option is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: The binding of glutamate to the AMPA-derived domain will trigger the Gq-protein signaling cascade characteristic of the mGluR1-derived intracellular domain. Therefore, the primary event will be the activation of Gq and the subsequent production of $IP_3$ and DAG.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1714482"}]}
