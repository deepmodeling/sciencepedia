A single, shared inhibitory interneuron that receives excitatory input from both neurons and projects inhibitory connections back to both.", "solution": "Goal: construct the simplest two-neuron circuit that produces stable antiphase oscillations. The defining properties of a half-center oscillator are:\n- When Neuron 1 is active, Neuron 2 is suppressed, and vice versa.\n- Activity alternates indefinitely, implying a mechanism that prevents a permanent winner-take-all state and enables switching.\n\nPrinciple 1: To enforce antiphase (one active, the other silent at any moment), the cross-connection between the two units must be inhibitory. Mutual excitation or electrical coupling tends to synchronize activity rather than alternate it.\n\nA minimal firing-rate description that captures this is\n$$\\tau \\dot{r}_{1}=-r_{1}+\\phi\\big(I_{1}-g r_{2}-a_{1}\\big), \\quad \\tau \\dot{r}_{2}=-r_{2}+\\phi\\big(I_{2}-g r_{1}-a_{2}\\big),$$\nwhere $r_{i}$ is the firing rate of Neuron $i$, $g>0$ represents the strength of inhibition from the other neuron, $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is a static input-output nonlinearity, and $a_{i}$ is a slow, activity-dependent negative feedback in Neuron $i$ (defined below). The terms $-g r_{2}$ in the first equation and $-g r_{1}$ in the second embody reciprocal (mutual) inhibition. This implements the necessary competition so that when one neuron is active, the other is driven down. Therefore, mutual inhibition is required. This corresponds to option B.\n\nPrinciple 2: To obtain sustained alternation rather than a static winner-take-all state, the active neuron must gradually weaken and relinquish dominance. Without a slow negative feedback, the system with reciprocal inhibition and equal drives tends to a stable fixed point in which one neuron remains high and the other remains low. Formally, if $a_{1}=a_{2}=0$ and $I_{1}=I_{2}$, the system typically admits stable asymmetric fixed points $(r_{1}^{*} \\gg r_{2}^{*})$ and $(r_{2}^{*} \\gg r_{1}^{*})$, not a limit cycle. Thus an additional slow process is required to destabilize the dominant state over time.\n\nA canonical minimal mechanism is intrinsic activity-dependent adaptation in each neuron. Let the slow variables satisfy\n$$\\tau_{a}\\dot{a}_{i}=\\beta r_{i}-a_{i}, \\quad i\\in\\{1,2\\}, \\quad \\text{with } \\tau_{a}\\gg \\tau, \\ \\beta>0,$$\nand enter the neuron's input subtractively as above. When Neuron $i$ is active, $r_{i}$ is large, so $a_{i}$ increases and progressively reduces the effective drive to that neuron. Eventually, the suppressed neuron escapes (or the active neuron releases), causing a switch. After the switch, the previously inactive neuron becomes active and accumulates its own adaptation, and the process repeats, producing a stable antiphase limit cycle due to timescale separation $\\tau_{a}\\gg \\tau$. This mechanism corresponds to option E.\n\nNon-essential or counterproductive alternatives:\n- Option A (mutual excitation) and Option C (gap junctions) promote synchrony, not antiphase alternation, so they do not satisfy the antiphase requirement.\n- Option D (tonic excitatory input) is commonly used to ensure both neurons can fire when released from inhibition, but it is not sufficient for oscillations (with B alone it yields winner-take-all) and not strictly necessary if intrinsic properties (e.g., post-inhibitory rebound or endogenous bursting) or network-induced negative feedback provide the requisite drive and switching; thus it is not among the two most fundamental requirements.\n- Option F (a single shared inhibitory interneuron inhibiting both) implements common-mode inhibition and tends to synchronize or co-suppress both neurons, not enforce reciprocal antiphase alternation in a two-unit minimal circuit.\n\nConclusion: The two most fundamental and necessary ingredients for a two-neuron half-center oscillator that alternates stably in antiphase are reciprocal inhibition between the neurons (B) and a slow, intrinsic fatigue/adaptation mechanism in each neuron to enable switching (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BE}$$", "id": "1698573"}, {"introduction": "A single oscillator can create a rhythm, but complex movements like locomotion require the precise coordination of multiple oscillators. This coordination is governed by two key parameters: period and phase. This practice uses the example of a hexapod robot to provide a concrete scenario for disentangling these two concepts [@problem_id:1698551]. By calculating the consequences of switching gaits, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how CPG networks can flexibly change the *pattern* of movement (phase) independently of its *speed* (period).", "problem": "A bio-inspired hexapod robot utilizes a network of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) to coordinate the movement of its six legs, which are labeled L1, L2, L3 (left side, front to back) and R1, R2, R3 (right side, front to back). The activation of a leg's power stroke occurs at phase zero of its corresponding CPG cycle.\n\nInitially, the robot employs a 'tripod gait' where all CPGs operate with a synchronized period of $T = 1.50$ seconds. In this gait, the legs are partitioned into two groups that move in unison: Group A = {R1, L2, R3} and Group B = {L1, R2, L3}. The activation of Group B is phase-shifted by exactly half a period relative to the activation of Group A. Assume that an activation of Group A occurs at time $t=0$.\n\nAt time $t_{switch} = 10.0$ seconds, the robot's control algorithm changes the coordination pattern to a 'ripple gait' while keeping the period constant at $T = 1.50$ seconds. In the ripple gait, the legs activate sequentially in the order R1, R2, R3, L1, L2, L3. The time delay between the activation of any two consecutive legs in this sequence is constant, and the entire sequence of six activations is completed in one full period $T$. The transition is synchronized such that the new ripple gait pattern begins with the activation of its first leg (R1) at the start of the first complete CPG cycle that commences at or after $t_{switch}$.\n\nDetermine the absolute time difference between the first activation of leg L3 under the new ripple gait and the time at which leg L3 *would have* activated if the robot had continued with the original tripod gait without switching.\n\nExpress your answer in seconds, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the gait period be $T$ and the switch time be $t_{switch}$.
