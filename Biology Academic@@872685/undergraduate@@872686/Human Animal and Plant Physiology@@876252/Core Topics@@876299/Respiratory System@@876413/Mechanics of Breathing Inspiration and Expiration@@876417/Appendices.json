We must calculate the maximum length allowed by each constraint and then determine the overall maximum functional length, which will be the smaller of the two values. Let the length of the snorkel be $L$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the pressure constraint. When a person is submerged at a depth $L$, the water exerts an external hydrostatic pressure on their chest. This pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{hydro}}$, must be overcome by the inspiratory muscles to expand the thoracic cavity. The hydrostatic pressure is given by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{hydro}} = \\rho g L $$\nFor successful inspiration, this pressure cannot exceed the maximum pressure difference the respiratory muscles can generate, $\\Delta P_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$ \\rho g L \\leq \\Delta P_{\\text{max}} $$\nThis inequality gives us the first limit on the length, which we'll call $L_{\\text{pressure}}$:\n$$ L \\leq \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{max}}}{\\rho g} $$\nSo, the maximum length based on the pressure constraint is:\n$$ L_{\\text{pressure}} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{max}}}{\\rho g} $$\n\nSecond, let's analyze the dead space constraint.
