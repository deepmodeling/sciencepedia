This first exercise explores a fundamental negative feedback loop that protects the small intestine from the highly acidic chyme arriving from the stomach. By considering the problem of pH regulation, you will practice identifying the specific hormonal response that restores homeostasis and allows digestive enzymes to function optimally [@problem_id:1738113].", "problem": "In the process of digestion, the stomach produces highly acidic chyme, which is a semifluid mass of partially digested food mixed with gastric secretions. When a sufficient amount of chyme has been processed, it is incrementally released into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. The duodenal lining, however, is not adapted to withstand the low pH of the chyme arriving from the stomach (typically pH 1.5-3.5), and the digestive enzymes active in the small intestine, such as pancreatic amylase and lipase, function optimally in a near-neutral to slightly alkaline environment (pH 7-8.5).\n\nConsidering this physiological context, which of the following options most accurately and completely describes the principal endocrine-mediated negative feedback response initiated in the duodenum to counteract the acidity of the arriving chyme and restore homeostatic pH levels?\n\nA. The low pH stimulates duodenal I-cells to release cholecystokinin (CCK), which promotes the secretion of enzyme-rich fluid from the pancreas and contraction of the gallbladder.\n\nB. The low pH stimulates duodenal S-cells to release secretin, which primarily promotes the secretion of bicarbonate-rich fluid from the pancreas and liver, while also inhibiting gastric acid secretion.\n\nC. The low pH stimulates G-cells in the duodenum to release gastrin, which travels to the pancreas and stimulates the release of glucagon to manage blood sugar levels after a meal.\n\nD. The low pH is detected by nerve endings, triggering a long reflex arc via the vagus nerve that inhibits all pancreatic and biliary secretion to allow the duodenum to empty.\n\nE. The low pH stimulates duodenal S-cells to release secretin, which primarily stimulates the secretion of digestive proenzymes (e.g., trypsinogen) from the pancreatic acinar cells.", "solution": "The physiological problem is that highly acidic chyme (typically pH between 1.5 and 3.5) enters the duodenum, whose mucosa is not adapted to low pH, and intestinal enzymes require near-neutral to slightly alkaline pH for optimal function. The principal endocrine negative feedback mechanism that restores duodenal pH involves acid-sensing enteroendocrine S-cells in the duodenum.\n\nStep-by-step mechanism:\n1. Stimulus: Low luminal pH in the duodenum (acidic chyme) is detected by duodenal S-cells.\n2. Endocrine response: S-cells release secretin into the bloodstream.\n3. Target organs and primary effects:\n   - Pancreas (ductal cells): Secretin stimulates secretion of bicarbonate-rich aqueous fluid. The bicarbonate neutralizes gastric acid, raising the duodenal pH toward neutrality, enabling pancreatic enzymes to function.\n   - Liver and biliary tree: Secretin stimulates cholangiocytes to secrete bicarbonate-rich bile, further contributing to neutralization in the duodenum.\n4. Additional negative feedback actions on the stomach:\n   - Secretin inhibits gastric acid secretion (directly reducing parietal cell activity and indirectly by reducing gastrin release and slowing gastric emptying), thereby decreasing the acid load delivered to the duodenum.\n5. Homeostatic resolution: As the duodenal pH normalizes, the stimulus for secretin release diminishes, completing the negative feedback loop.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A: Incorrect. I-cells release cholecystokinin primarily in response to fats and amino acids, stimulating enzyme-rich pancreatic secretion and gallbladder contraction. This is not the principal response to low pH and does not primarily neutralize acidity.\n- B: Correct. Low pH stimulates S-cells to release secretin, which promotes bicarbonate-rich secretion from the pancreas and liver/biliary system and inhibits gastric acid secretion, constituting the principal endocrine-mediated negative feedback for duodenal acid neutralization.\n- C: Incorrect. G-cells are in the gastric antrum, and gastrin stimulates gastric acid secretion; it does not trigger pancreatic glucagon release.\n- D: Incorrect. While neural reflexes modulate secretion, a vagovagal long reflex does not principally inhibit all pancreatic and biliary secretion in response to acid; moreover, the question asks for the principal endocrine-mediated response.\n- E: Incorrect. Secretin does not primarily stimulate secretion of digestive proenzymes from acinar cells; that is mainly driven by cholecystokinin and vagal acetylcholine. Secretin’s primary pancreatic effect is on ductal bicarbonate secretion.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete description is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1738113"}, {"introduction": "The regulation of digestion is not a single event but a beautifully orchestrated sequence unfolding over several hours. This practice challenges you to think about the digestive process as a journey in time and space, from the stomach to the distal intestine. You will predict the order in which key hormones peak after a meal, linking the anatomical location of endocrine cells to the timing of their crucial signals [@problem_id:1738047].", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to study the endocrine response to a meal in a healthy human subject. The subject, after an overnight fast, consumes a large, balanced test meal rich in proteins, fats, and complex carbohydrates. Over the next four hours, blood samples are drawn periodically to measure the plasma concentrations of three specific gastrointestinal hormones: gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Your task is to predict the physiological response. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected temporal sequence of the plasma concentration peaks for these three hormones?\n\nA. CCK levels will peak first, followed by a simultaneous peak of gastrin and PYY as the meal is fully processed in the small and large intestines.\n\nB. Gastrin, CCK, and PYY levels will all begin to rise simultaneously upon ingestion of the meal, peaking together approximately one hour later before gradually declining.\n\nC. Gastrin levels will peak first, followed by CCK. The peak in PYY concentration will occur significantly later than the peaks for both gastrin and CCK.\n\nD. PYY levels will show the first and highest peak to signal satiety, followed by a peak in gastrin to initiate digestion, and finally a peak in CCK to facilitate absorption.\n\nE. Gastrin and CCK levels will rise and peak together as the meal enters the stomach and duodenum, followed by a much later peak in PYY concentration.", "solution": "We identify the principal sources, stimuli, and anatomical transit constraints for each hormone, then infer the expected timing of their postprandial peaks.\n\nGastrin is secreted by G cells in the gastric antrum, primarily stimulated by gastric distension, peptides and amino acids in the lumen, and vagal cholinergic input. After ingestion at $t=0$, the stomach rapidly experiences distension and exposure to peptides from the mixed meal, so gastrin secretion rises promptly during the cephalic and early gastric phases. Thus, the peak in gastrin concentration occurs early, soon after the meal begins to be processed in the stomach.\n\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is secreted by I cells in the duodenum and jejunum, primarily stimulated by fats and partially digested proteins in the small intestinal lumen. CCK release requires that chyme exit the stomach and enter the duodenum. Because gastric emptying of a large mixed meal takes time and is slowed by fat, the arrival of significant stimulatory nutrients in the duodenum lags behind the initial gastric phase. Therefore, the CCK peak follows the gastrin peak, as chyme progressively enters the proximal small intestine. Consequently, $t_{\\text{peak,gastrin}} < t_{\\text{peak,CCK}}$.\n\nPeptide YY (PYY) is secreted by L cells predominantly in the distal ileum and colon, stimulated especially by fats and, to a lesser extent, proteins and bile acids arriving in the distal gut. The main rise in PYY requires nutrients to traverse much of the small intestine, which takes substantially longer than the time required for duodenal exposure. Although there can be minor early neural or endocrine components, the dominant postprandial PYY peak is delayed and often occurs well after the peaks of gastrin and CCK. Therefore, $t_{\\text{peak,CCK}} \\ll t_{\\text{peak,PYY}}$, yielding the overall ordering $t_{\\text{peak,gastrin}} < t_{\\text{peak,CCK}} \\ll t_{\\text{peak,PYY}}$.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- Option A incorrectly places CCK first and suggests a simultaneous peak of gastrin and PYY later; this contradicts the early gastric phase rise of gastrin and the delayed distal-gut-driven PYY peak.\n- Option B posits simultaneous rise and peak; this ignores the anatomical and physiological delays between gastric, duodenal, and distal intestinal phases.\n- Option C states that gastrin peaks first, followed by CCK, with PYY peaking significantly later than both, which matches the physiological sequence derived above.\n- Option D incorrectly places PYY first and highest; PYY is characteristically delayed.\n- Option E claims gastrin and CCK peak together as the meal enters stomach and duodenum; while both rise early, CCK depends on duodenal entry and thus lags behind gastrin rather than peaking together.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate temporal sequence is gastrin first, then CCK, with PYY peaking significantly later, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1738047"}, {"introduction": "A powerful way to understand a physiological system is to predict what happens when a component fails. This problem presents a hypothetical scenario involving a genetic knockout mouse that cannot respond to the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). By working through this thought experiment, you will apply your knowledge of CCK's role in fat digestion and feedback regulation to diagnose a primary digestive defect and predict the long-term consequences on hormone levels [@problem_id:1738057].", "problem": "A team of physiologists has developed a line of knockout mice in which the gene for the CCK1 receptor is non-functional. The hormone Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone secreted by enteroendocrine cells of the duodenum and jejunum primarily in response to the presence of fatty acids and amino acids in the chyme. In a healthy animal, CCK binds to CCK1 receptors on various target organs, most notably causing potent contraction of the gallbladder and stimulating the secretion of enzyme-rich fluid from the pancreatic acinar cells.\n\nAssuming these knockout mice are fed a standard diet containing fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, which of the following options most accurately predicts the primary digestive insufficiency and the resulting chronic change in the plasma concentration of a key digestive hormone?\n\nA. Primary defect in protein digestion; Chronically decreased plasma CCK levels.\n\nB. Primary defect in fat digestion; Chronically elevated plasma CCK levels.\n\nC. Primary defect in carbohydrate digestion; Chronically elevated plasma secretin levels.\n\nD. Primary defect in fat digestion; Chronically decreased plasma CCK levels.\n\nE. Accelerated gastric emptying; Chronically elevated plasma ghrelin levels.", "solution": "**Step 1: Analyze the physiological role of the CCK1 receptor.**\nThe problem states that Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released in response to fats and proteins in the small intestine. It then acts on CCK1 receptors. The primary functions mediated by these receptors are:\n1.  **Gallbladder Contraction:** This action releases stored bile into the duodenum. Bile salts are essential for the emulsification of dietary fats, breaking large fat globules into smaller micelles. This process dramatically increases the surface area available for enzymatic digestion.\n2.  **Pancreatic Enzyme Secretion:** This action stimulates pancreatic acinar cells to release a suite of digestive enzymes, including pancreatic lipase (for fat digestion), proteases like trypsinogen (for protein digestion), and amylase (for carbohydrate digestion). The stimulation of lipase secretion is a particularly strong effect of CCK.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the primary digestive insufficiency in CCK1 receptor knockout mice.**\nIn mice lacking functional CCK1 receptors, CCK, even if present in the blood, cannot execute its normal functions.\n-   The gallbladder will not receive the signal to contract. This leads to a failure of bile release into the duodenum, a condition known as biliary insufficiency. Without bile, fat emulsification is severely impaired.\n-   The pancreas will not receive the potent CCK signal to secrete digestive enzymes. This results in a marked deficiency of pancreatic enzymes in the intestinal lumen, especially pancreatic lipase.\nThe combination of failed emulsification (no bile) and lack of the primary fat-digesting enzyme (no lipase) leads to a profound inability to digest and absorb dietary fats. This is known as fat malabsorption or steatorrhea. While protein digestion is also hampered by the lack of pancreatic proteases, the dual failure affecting fat digestion makes it the most significant and primary digestive defect. Carbohydrate digestion is less affected as it begins in the mouth and involves brush border enzymes in addition to pancreatic amylase. Therefore, the primary digestive insufficiency is a severe defect in fat digestion.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the resulting change in plasma hormone levels.**\nThe stimulus for CCK secretion by the I-cells of the small intestine is the presence of undigested fats (fatty acids) and proteins (amino acids) in the lumen.\n-   In the CCK1 receptor knockout mice, fats are not being digested and absorbed.\n-   This means that the concentration of the stimulating molecules (fats and their derivatives) in the duodenal and jejunal lumen remains high for an extended period.\n-   This persistent stimulus leads to continuous and robust secretion of CCK from the I-cells. The feedback loop, where digestion and absorption of nutrients would normally remove the stimulus for CCK release, is broken.\n-   Consequently, despite the inability of the hormone to act on its target organs, its synthesis and secretion are upregulated. This results in chronically elevated levels of CCK in the plasma.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n-   **A. Primary defect in protein digestion; Chronically decreased plasma CCK levels.** Incorrect. The primary defect is fat digestion, and CCK levels would be elevated, not decreased.\n-   **B. Primary defect in fat digestion; Chronically elevated plasma CCK levels.** Correct. This option accurately identifies the most severe digestive defect and the logical consequence of the broken feedback loop on hormone concentration.\n-   **C. Primary defect in carbohydrate digestion; Chronically elevated plasma secretin levels.** Incorrect. Carbohydrate digestion is not the primary defect. Secretin is released in response to acid, a different pathway.\n-   **D. Primary defect in fat digestion; Chronically decreased plasma CCK levels.** Incorrect. This option correctly identifies the digestive defect but incorrectly predicts the hormonal response. The lack of nutrient clearance leads to *increased*, not decreased, stimulation of CCK secretion.\n-   **E. Accelerated gastric emptying; Chronically elevated plasma ghrelin levels.** Incorrect. CCK normally slows gastric emptying, so its lack of function might lead to faster emptying, but this is a secondary effect, not the primary digestive insufficiency. The connection to ghrelin is also less direct and certain than the effect on CCK levels themselves.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the most accurate prediction is a primary defect in fat digestion coupled with chronically elevated plasma CCK levels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1738057"}]}
