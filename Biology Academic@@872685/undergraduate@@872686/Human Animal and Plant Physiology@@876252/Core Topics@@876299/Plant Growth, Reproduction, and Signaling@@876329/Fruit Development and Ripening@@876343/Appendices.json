Both fruits are harvested at the stage of commercial maturity, meaning they are mature but not yet fully ripe. Fruit A is classified as a climacteric fruit, while Fruit B is classified as a non-climacteric fruit. Immediately after harvest, samples of each fruit are placed into separate, sealed, temperature-controlled chambers. The concentration of carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) and ethylene gas within each chamber is continuously monitored for several days.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected changes in gas concentrations within the two chambers over the monitoring period?\n\nA. Chamber A, containing the climacteric fruit, will show a dramatic and relatively sudden increase in both $\\text{CO}_2$ and ethylene concentrations peaking well after harvest, followed by a decline.

Chamber A will show a sharp peak in $\\text{CO}_2$ but a steady, low level of ethylene. Chamber B will show a steady decline in $\\text{CO}_2$ but a sharp peak in ethylene, which triggers ripening without a respiratory burst.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the pattern of carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) and ethylene production in two types of fruits, climacteric (Fruit A) and non-climacteric (Fruit B), after harvest. This requires understanding the fundamental physiological differences in their ripening processes.\n\n**Step 1: Define Climacteric and Non-climacteric Ripening**\nThe key distinction between these two fruit types lies in their respiratory patterns and sensitivity to the plant hormone ethylene during ripening.\n- **Climacteric fruits** (like bananas, apples, tomatoes, and Fruit A) undergo a distinct phase during ripening called the \"climacteric rise.\" This is characterized by a dramatic increase in the rate of respiration, which means a significant increase in oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) consumption and carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) production. This respiratory burst is autocatalytically triggered and sustained by a spike in the production of ethylene gas. In essence, a small amount of ethylene triggers the production of more ethylene and a surge in metabolic activity (respiration) that drives the ripening process (changes in color, texture, and aroma). When harvested mature but unripe, this entire process occurs off the plant.\n- **Non-climacteric fruits** (like citrus, grapes, strawberries, and Fruit B) do not exhibit this climacteric rise in respiration. They ripen more gradually. Their respiration rate is typically highest at harvest and then slowly and steadily declines as they age and senesce. While they produce trace amounts of ethylene, they do not have the autocatalytic ethylene production mechanism and are generally not responsive to external ethylene for initiating ripening (though it can accelerate senescence).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Expected Gas Profile for Fruit A (Climacteric)**\nFruit A is climacteric and was harvested mature but unripe.\n- Initially, its respiration rate will be relatively low, so $\\text{CO}_2$ production will be low.\n- As the ripening process initiates, there will be a burst of ethylene synthesis.\n- This ethylene burst will trigger the climacteric rise in respiration. Consequently, we expect to see a sharp and significant increase in the concentration of $\\text{CO}_2$ in Chamber A.\n- The peaks of ethylene and $\\text{CO}_2$ production are closely linked and occur well after harvest.\n- After this peak, as the fruit becomes fully ripe and enters senescence (aging), the respiration rate and ethylene production will decline.\n- Therefore, for Chamber A, the expected pattern is a low initial rate, followed by a large, relatively sharp peak in both ethylene and $\\text{CO}_2$, and then a fall.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Expected Gas Profile for Fruit B (Non-climacteric)**\nFruit B is non-climacteric.\n- Ripening in these fruits is a more gradual continuation of processes that began on the plant. They do not have a respiratory burst to complete ripening.\n- At the point of harvest, their metabolic rate is at its highest.\n- After being detached from the parent plant (their source of nutrients), their respiration rate will begin a slow, steady decline as they consume their stored reserves.\n- Ethylene production remains at very low, basal, and physiologically insignificant levels throughout the post-harvest period.\n- Therefore, for Chamber B, we expect an initial $\\text{CO}_2$ level that only decreases over time. Ethylene levels will be negligible.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options**\n- **A:** This option correctly describes the expected patterns. Chamber A (climacteric) shows a dramatic post-harvest increase in both $\\text{CO}_2$ and ethylene. Chamber B (non-climacteric) shows a gradually decreasing $\\text{CO}_2$ level from a high initial point and negligible ethylene. This matches our analysis.\n- **B:** This option reverses the roles of climacteric and non-climacteric fruits. It is incorrect.\n- **C:** This option incorrectly claims both fruits show a steady decline and negligible ethylene, ignoring the defining climacteric burst of Fruit A. It is incorrect.\n- **D:** This option incorrectly suggests both fruits are climacteric. The pattern described is only characteristic of Fruit A. It is incorrect.\n- **E:** This option incorrectly decouples the $\\text{CO}_2$ and ethylene peaks. In climacteric fruits, the ethylene burst *causes* the respiratory ($\\text{CO}_2$) burst. It also incorrectly suggests a non-climacteric fruit would have an ethylene peak. It is incorrect.\n\nBased on the physiological principles of fruit ripening, option A provides the most accurate description of the events.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1707774"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of ethylene in the climacteric burst, we now turn to the source of this crucial signal. This thought experiment takes you into the world of molecular genetics to explore the ethylene biosynthesis pathway. By considering a scenario where a key enzyme, ACC synthase, is non-functional, you can deduce the consequences for ripening and discover how an external stimulus can potentially rescue the process, highlighting the critical difference between having the capacity to ripen and initiating the trigger. [@problem_id:1707775]", "problem": "In plant physiology, fruit ripening is a complex, genetically programmed process. Fruits are broadly classified as climacteric or non-climacteric. Climacteric fruits, such as tomatoes, bananas, and apples, exhibit a characteristic burst in respiration and ethylene production at the onset of ripening. Ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, is the primary trigger for this process. The biosynthesis of ethylene in plant tissues follows a well-established pathway, starting from the amino acid methionine. A crucial, rate-limiting step in this pathway is the conversion of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme ACC synthase.\n\nA team of plant scientists has developed a genetically modified tomato plant in which the gene encoding the ACC synthase enzyme has been rendered completely non-functional through targeted gene editing. The fruits on this plant develop and grow to their normal mature size. Considering the role of ACC synthase in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, select the option that most accurately describes the expected phenotype of these fruits.\n\nA. The fruit ripens prematurely on the vine, showing accelerated softening and color change.\n\nB. The fruit fails to undergo ripening and remains green and firm. Ripening cannot be induced by any external chemical treatment because the ripening machinery is fundamentally broken.\n\nC. The fruit develops to a mature green state but fails to ripen on its own. However, the ripening process (color change, softening) can be successfully initiated by exposing the harvested fruit to external ethylene gas.\n\nD. The fruit ripens normally, but the process is significantly delayed by several weeks compared to wild-type tomatoes.\n\nE. The fruit fails to grow to its full size and drops from the plant before reaching the mature green stage.", "solution": "Climacteric fruit ripening depends on a burst of endogenous ethylene that triggers and sustains ripening via an autocatalytic loop. Ethylene biosynthesis proceeds through the methionine cycle: methionine is converted to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), then ACC synthase catalyzes the rate-limiting step from SAM to ACC, and ACC oxidase converts ACC to ethylene. Symbolically,\n$$\n\\text{Methionine} \\to \\text{SAM} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ACC synthase}} \\text{ACC} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ACC oxidase}} \\text{ethylene}.\n$$\nIf the ACC synthase gene is rendered completely non-functional, endogenous production of ACC is effectively eliminated. Consequently, endogenous ethylene biosynthesis is blocked at the SAM-to-ACC step, preventing the climacteric ethylene burst and the associated autonomous initiation of ripening. Development to mature green size is unaffected because fruit growth occurs prior to ripening and is regulated primarily by hormones other than ethylene.\n\nDespite the block in ethylene biosynthesis, the downstream ethylene perception and signaling machinery (receptors, signaling components, and ripening gene networks) remain intact. Exogenous ethylene bypasses the blocked biosynthetic step by directly activating receptors and downstream transcriptional programs necessary for ripening (color change, softening, flavor volatiles). Therefore, the fruit will not ripen on the plant on its own but can be induced to ripen after harvest by exposure to ethylene gas.\n\nThis matches the description that the fruit reaches mature green stage, fails to ripen autonomously, but ripening can be initiated by external ethylene, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1707775"}, {"introduction": "Producing a hormonal signal is only half the story; the target cells must also perceive it and respond. This advanced exercise moves beyond hormone synthesis to the intricate signaling cascade that ethylene triggers inside the cell. By analyzing a pathway involving negative regulators like CTR1 and applying different chemical inhibitors, you will practice a form of molecular systems thinking. This problem demonstrates how a detailed understanding of signal transduction allows for precise manipulation of biological processes, a cornerstone of modern agricultural biotechnology. [@problem_id:1707717]", "problem": "The ripening of climacteric fruits, such as tomatoes, is primarily regulated by the gaseous plant hormone ethylene. A simplified model of the canonical ethylene signal transduction pathway is as follows: In the absence of ethylene, its transmembrane receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum are in an active state. These active receptors phosphorylate and activate a protein kinase known as Constitutive Triple Response 1 (CTR1). Active CTR1, in turn, acts as a negative regulator of the pathway by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating the downstream signaling component, EIN2. When ethylene binds to its receptors, the receptor-CTR1 complex is inactivated. This prevents the phosphorylation of EIN2, allowing it to become active and initiate a nuclear signaling cascade that results in the expression of ripening-associated genes.\n\nAn agricultural scientist is studying two compounds to control ripening. The first is 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), which is known to bind irreversibly to the ethylene binding site of the receptors, thus locking them in their active, ethylene-free conformation. The second is a novel experimental compound, \"RipenFast,\" which has been shown to be a potent, non-competitive inhibitor of the CTR1 kinase. RipenFast binds directly to the CTR1 protein at a site distinct from its interaction domain with the receptors, completely abolishing its kinase activity regardless of the state of the upstream receptors.\n\nAn unripe tomato is first treated with a saturating dose of 1-MCP. After this pre-treatment, the same tomato is treated with RipenFast. Based on the provided signaling model, predict the resulting phenotype of the tomato.\n\nA. The tomato will ripen, as the inhibitory action of RipenFast on CTR1 bypasses the upstream block created by 1-MCP.\n\nB. Ripening will be permanently inhibited, as the irreversible binding of 1-MCP to the receptors is the dominant and overriding effect.\n\nC. The two compounds will generate conflicting signals, leading to cellular apoptosis and rapid tissue decay rather than organized ripening.\n\nD. The effects of 1-MCP and RipenFast will cancel each other out, leaving the fruit in a quiescent, unripe state but still capable of ripening if the compounds were removed.\n\nE. Ripening will be initiated but will proceed at a much slower rate than normal, as the active receptors still partially antagonize the downstream signaling.", "solution": "Define the pathway elements as follows: receptors $R$, CTR1 kinase $C$, and EIN2 $E$. In the absence of ethylene, receptors are in the active conformation $R_{\\text{active}}$, which activates CTR1, $C_{\\text{active}}$. Active CTR1 phosphorylates EIN2, $C_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow E_{\\text{P,inactive}}$, thereby blocking downstream transcription necessary for ripening. When ethylene binds, receptors are inactivated, $R_{\\text{inactive}}$, which inactivates CTR1, $C_{\\text{inactive}}$, thereby preventing phosphorylation of EIN2 so that $E$ remains unphosphorylated and active, $E_{\\text{active}}$, leading to ripening.\n\nFirst treatment: a saturating dose of 1-MCP irreversibly occupies the ethylene binding sites and locks $R$ in the ethylene-free active conformation. Therefore, after 1-MCP, the state is $R_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow C_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow E_{\\text{P,inactive}}$, which blocks ripening.\n\nSecond treatment: RipenFast is a potent, non-competitive inhibitor of CTR1 that binds directly to $C$ at a site distinct from receptor interaction and completely abolishes kinase activity regardless of receptor state. Therefore, after RipenFast, $C \\rightarrow C_{\\text{inactive}}$ even though $R_{\\text{active}}$ persists due to 1-MCP. With $C_{\\text{inactive}}$, phosphorylation of EIN2 does not occur, so EIN2 becomes or remains unphosphorylated and active: $C_{\\text{inactive}} \\Rightarrow E_{\\text{active}}$. Active EIN2 initiates the nuclear signaling cascade that induces ripening-associated gene expression, producing the ripening phenotype.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is consistent with $C$ being inactivated downstream of the receptor block, enabling $E_{\\text{active}}$ and ripening.\n- B is incorrect because the downstream inactivation of $C$ bypasses the upstream receptor lock.\n- C is not supported by the model; there is no contradictory pro-apoptotic signaling indicated.\n- D is incorrect because the effects do not cancel; $C$ is functionally off, allowing ripening.\n- E is incorrect because RipenFast completely abolishes CTR1 activity; active receptors cannot partially antagonize the pathway when $C=0$.\n\nTherefore, the predicted phenotype is ripening, as per option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1707717"}]}
