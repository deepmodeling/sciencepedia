This practice explores how the physical dimensions of this cleft are not arbitrary but are finely tuned to ensure efficient neurotransmission. By considering a hypothetical scenario where the cleft width is altered, you will apply principles of diffusion and enzyme kinetics to predict the impact on the postsynaptic signal, revealing the critical relationship between transmitter diffusion time and its degradation [@problem_id:2351366].", "problem": "In a study of a model chemical synapse, a presynaptic neuron releases a fixed quantity of a neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft upon the arrival of an action potential. This neurotransmitter diffuses across the cleft to bind with receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, generating a Postsynaptic Potential (PSP). The synaptic cleft is not an empty space; it contains enzymes that actively degrade the neurotransmitter, reducing its concentration over time.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic mutation that causes the width of this synaptic cleft to become exactly twice its normal size, while all other properties, including the number of neurotransmitter molecules released per action potential, the concentration and efficacy of the degradative enzymes, and the density and properties of the postsynaptic receptors, remain unchanged.\n\nBased on the principles of diffusion and enzymatic degradation, what is the most likely effect of this doubled cleft width on the peak amplitude of the PSP generated by a single presynaptic action potential?\n\nA. The amplitude of the postsynaptic potential will significantly decrease.\n\nB. The amplitude of the postsynaptic potential will double.\n\nC. The amplitude of the postsynaptic potential will be halved.\n\nD. The amplitude of the postsynaptic potential will remain unchanged.\n\nE. The postsynaptic potential will switch from excitatory to inhibitory.\n\nF. The latency of the postsynaptic potential will decrease, but its amplitude will be unchanged.", "solution": "We model neurotransmitter diffusion across the synaptic cleft with enzymatic degradation as one-dimensional diffusion with first-order decay. Let the cleft width be $L$ (normal) and receptors be at $x=L$. A presynaptic action potential releases $N$ molecules at $x=0$ at $t=0$. The concentration $C(x,t)$ satisfies the reaction-diffusion equation\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}} - k C,\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $k$ is the effective first-order degradation rate due to enzymes (assumed unchanged by the mutation). For an instantaneous point release in an effectively unbounded medium, the Green’s function solution is\n$$\nC(x,t) = \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{x^{2}}{4 D t}\\Big)\\exp(-k t).\n$$\nEvaluated at the postsynaptic membrane ($x=L$), the time-dependent concentration driving receptor activation is\n$$\nC_{m}(t;L) = \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{L^{2}}{4 D t}\\Big)\\exp(-k t).\n$$\n\nThe peak postsynaptic potential amplitude is a monotonically increasing function of the peak transmitter concentration at the membrane (e.g., for typical ligand-gated receptors, open probability is a monotone function of ligand concentration such as a Hill function). Therefore, it suffices to analyze the peak of $C_{m}(t;L)$ with respect to $t$.\n\nTo find the peak time $t^{*}(L)$, maximize $C_{m}(t;L)$ by setting $\\frac{d}{d t}\\ln C_{m}(t;L)=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d t}\\ln C_{m} = -\\frac{1}{2 t} + \\frac{L^{2}}{4 D}\\frac{1}{t^{2}} - k = 0.\n$$\nMultiply by $t^{2}$ to obtain a quadratic in $t$:\n$$\nk t^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} t - \\frac{L^{2}}{4 D} = 0.\n$$\nThe positive root gives\n$$\nt^{*}(L) = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + k \\frac{L^{2}}{D}}}{2 k},\n$$\nwith the limiting case $t^{*}(L) \\to \\frac{L^{2}}{2 D}$ when $k \\to 0$. Since the square-root term increases with $L^{2}$, $t^{*}(L)$ is strictly increasing in $L$. Thus, doubling the cleft width increases the latency to peak concentration at the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nDefine the peak concentration at the membrane as\n$$\nC_{\\max}(L) \\equiv \\max_{t>0} C_{m}(t;L) = C_{m}\\!\\big(L, t^{*}(L)\\big).\n$$\nTo determine how $C_{\\max}$ changes with $L$, use the envelope theorem: because $t^{*}(L)$ maximizes $C_{m}$ with respect to $t$, we have $\\frac{\\partial C_{m}}{\\partial t}\\big|_{t=t^{*}}=0$, and therefore\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d L} C_{\\max}(L) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} C_{m}\\!\\big(L, t^{*}(L)\\big).\n$$\nCompute the partial derivative with respect to $L$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} C_{m}(t;L) = C_{m}(t;L)\\left(-\\frac{L}{2 D t}\\right).\n$$\nEvaluated at $t=t^{*}(L)$, this gives\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d L} C_{\\max}(L) = -\\frac{L}{2 D\\, t^{*}(L)}\\, C_{\\max}(L) < 0\n$$\nfor all $L>0$, since $D>0$, $t^{*}(L)>0$, and $C_{\\max}(L)>0$. Hence, $C_{\\max}(L)$ is strictly decreasing in $L$. Therefore, doubling the cleft width from $L$ to $2L$ strictly reduces the peak neurotransmitter concentration at the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nBecause the postsynaptic potential amplitude is a monotone increasing function of the transmitter concentration at the receptors and all postsynaptic receptor properties are unchanged, the peak PSP amplitude must also decrease when the cleft width doubles. Moreover, enzymatic degradation ($k>0$) exacerbates the reduction by imposing an extra exponential factor $\\exp(-k t)$ that penalizes the longer diffusion time $t^{*}(2L)>t^{*}(L)$, making the reduction more pronounced than diffusion alone. The latency increases rather than decreases, ruling out any claim of decreased latency.\n\nTherefore, the most likely effect is a significant decrease in the peak PSP amplitude, not a precise halving, doubling, or no change, and without any change in polarity (excitatory vs inhibitory) since receptor type is unchanged.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351366"}, {"introduction": "For a neuron to communicate effectively over time, it must not only release neurotransmitters but also efficiently recycle the synaptic vesicles that carry them. This exercise places you in the role of a cell biologist investigating the machinery of endocytosis, the process of vesicle retrieval. By comparing the structural consequences of inhibiting two different key proteins—clathrin and dynamin—you will gain a deeper appreciation for the distinct, sequential roles they play in reforming functional vesicles from the presynaptic membrane [@problem_id:2351314].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the molecular machinery of synaptic vesicle recycling in cultured hippocampal neurons. Two distinct experimental conditions are established to probe the roles of key proteins.\n\n*   **Condition A:** Neurons are treated with a non-hydrolyzable analog of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), called GTPγS. This molecule can bind to GTP-binding proteins like dynamin but cannot be hydrolyzed, effectively locking them in their GTP-bound state.\n*   **Condition B:** Neurons are derived from a transgenic mouse line where the gene for the clathrin heavy chain has been conditionally deleted, resulting in a complete absence of functional clathrin protein.\n\nAfter applying these conditions, the neurons in both groups are subjected to strong electrical stimulation to induce a high level of synaptic activity and trigger compensatory endocytosis.

After scission, uncoating by Hsc70 and auxilin yields a free uncoated vesicle.\n\nCondition A (GTPγS treatment):\n- GTPγS binds GTPases such as dynamin but cannot be hydrolyzed. Dynamin requires GTP hydrolysis to complete membrane fission. In the GTP-bound, nonhydrolyzable state, dynamin can assemble into collars around the necks of coated pits but cannot catalyze scission.\n- Therefore, endocytic intermediates accumulate at the stage immediately prior to fission: deeply invaginated, clathrin-coated pits connected to the plasma membrane by elongated, narrow necks with dynamin collars. This produces numerous arrested, narrow-necked coated pits.\n\nCondition B (loss of clathrin heavy chain):\n- Without clathrin heavy chain, clathrin triskelia cannot assemble into a coat. Although adaptor proteins can bind cargo and the membrane, they do not form the polyhedral lattice necessary to stabilize curvature and generate canonical clathrin-coated pits.\n- As a result, classical clathrin-coated pits do not form. Ultrastructurally, the presynaptic plasma membrane will lack the characteristic invaginations and coats of CCPs and appear relatively smooth with respect to this pathway.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches the above: Condition A yields many deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits with elongated necks; Condition B shows a smooth membrane lacking coated pits.\n- B is incorrect because dynamin inhibition would not produce a smooth membrane in A, and clathrin deletion would not yield abundant fully formed vesicles; adaptors alone do not make stable coated vesicles, and vesicle formation is impaired.\n- C is incorrect because the two perturbations arrest different stages: dynamin block arrests at narrow-necked coated pits; clathrin loss prevents coated pit formation.\n- D is incorrect: dynamin block does not increase free-floating uncoated vesicles; clathrin deletion affects endocytosis, not vesicle fusion.\n- E is incorrect: without clathrin, the same stalk-like, deeply invaginated pits do not form; the lattice that stabilizes such intermediates is absent.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351314"}, {"introduction": "The signal's journey doesn't end when it reaches the postsynaptic membrane; its local impact is heavily shaped by the intricate geometry of structures like dendritic spines. This practice models the neck of a dendritic spine to quantify its role in synaptic compartmentalization, a key mechanism for synaptic independence and plasticity. You will use fundamental physical laws to calculate both the electrical isolation and the biochemical containment provided by the spine neck, offering a quantitative link between subcellular structure and synaptic function [@problem_id:1745640].", "problem": "Dendritic spines are small membranous protrusions from a neuron's dendrite that typically receive input from a single synapse.

The cytoplasm within the neck has an electrical resistivity of $\\rho_{cyto}$. When the synapse on the spine head is activated, an inward synaptic current $I_{syn}$ is generated, and simultaneously, the concentration of free calcium ions inside the spine head is elevated to a steady value of $C_{head}$.

We will solve for each quantity separately.\n\n**Part 1: Electrical Compartmentalization (Voltage Drop, $\\Delta V$)**\n\nFirst, we model the dendritic spine neck as a cylindrical resistor. The resistance $R$ of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n$$R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the resistivity, $L$ is the length, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area.
