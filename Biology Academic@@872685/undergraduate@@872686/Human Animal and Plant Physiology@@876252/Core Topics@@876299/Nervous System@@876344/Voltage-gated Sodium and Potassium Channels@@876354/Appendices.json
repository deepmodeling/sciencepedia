Therefore, the resting potential depolarizes (becomes less negative).\n\n2) Effect on excitability under sustained moderate hyperkalemia:\n- The upstroke of the action potential relies on the availability of voltage-gated sodium channels, quantified by the product of gating variables in Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, $g_{\\text{Na,available}}\\propto \\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}} m^{3}h$. The inactivation gate $h$ approaches a steady-state value that depends on membrane potential, often described by a Boltzmann relationship $h_{\\infty}(V)$ that decreases as $V$ is depolarized.\n- A sustained depolarization (minutes) causes $h$ to relax to a reduced steady-state value $h_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{rest}}^{\\text{depolarized}})<h_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{rest}}^{\\text{normal}})$, reducing the fraction of available sodium channels. This lowers the maximal rate of rise of the action potential and raises the effective threshold, making it harder to elicit a spike.\n- Although an immediate, brief depolarization may transiently bring the membrane closer to threshold, the problem specifies that the neuron is allowed to stabilize for minutes in the hyperkalemic solution. Thus the sustained, combined effect is a depolarized resting potential with reduced excitability due to sodium channel inactivation.\n\nConclusion: The resting potential becomes less negative (depolarizes), and the neuron becomes less excitable due to inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels.

This exercise challenges you to think like a neurophysiologist by predicting the consequences of a hypothetical neurotoxin that selectively blocks voltage-gated potassium channels. By dissecting the effects on the action potential waveform, you will solidify your understanding of the critical role potassium efflux plays in the repolarization phase and the overall timing of neural signals [@problem_id:1757985].", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is investigating the properties of a neuron by recording its action potentials. The typical action potential in this neuron is characterized by a rapid depolarization phase, followed by a repolarization phase, and a brief after-hyperpolarization period before returning to the resting membrane potential. The rapid depolarization is mediated by the influx of sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) through voltage-gated sodium channels, while the repolarization is primarily driven by the efflux of potassium ions ($K^{+}$) through voltage-gated potassium channels.\n\nThe researcher then applies a specific neurotoxin, Toxin-K, to the neuron's extracellular environment. This toxin is known to be a potent and highly selective blocker of the voltage-gated potassium channels responsible for repolarization, without affecting the voltage-gated sodium channels, leak channels, or the sodium-potassium pump.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the principal change to the shape of a single action potential waveform immediately following the effective application of Toxin-K?\n\nA.

The falling phase (repolarization) will be significantly prolonged, and the after-hyperpolarization phase will be absent.\n\nE. The neuron's resting membrane potential will become significantly less negative (more depolarized), leading to spontaneous, uncontrolled firing.", "solution": "We model the membrane with the current-balance equation\n$$\nC_{m}\\,\\frac{dV}{dt}=-\\left(I_{\\mathrm{Na}}+I_{K}+I_{L}\\right)+I_{\\mathrm{ext}},\n$$\nwhere, in Hodgkin–Huxley form,\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}}=g_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\,m^{3}h\\,(V-E_{\\mathrm{Na}}),\\qquad I_{K}=g_{K}\\,n^{4}\\,(V-E_{K}),\\qquad I_{L}=g_{L}\\,(V-E_{L}).\n$$\nHere $C_{m}$ is membrane capacitance, $g_{\\mathrm{Na}},g_{K},g_{L}$ are maximal conductances, $E_{\\mathrm{Na}},E_{K},E_{L}$ are the respective reversal potentials, and $m,h,n$ are gating variables. In a normal action potential, the rapid upstroke (depolarization) is driven by the large inward sodium current $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ as $m$ activates quickly, while the falling phase (repolarization) is produced primarily by the outward potassium current $I_{K}$ as $n$ activates and $g_{K}$ rises, with after-hyperpolarization arising from the persistently elevated $g_{K}$ driving $V$ toward $E_{K}$.\n\nToxin-K is specified to be a potent, selective blocker of the voltage-gated potassium channels responsible for repolarization, without affecting voltage-gated sodium channels, leak channels, or the sodium–potassium pump. Thus, upon effective application, during the voltage range of the action potential we have\n$$\nI_{K}\\approx 0 \\quad \\text{(via } g_{K}\\to 0 \\text{ for the voltage-gated component)},\n$$\nwhile $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{L}$ are unchanged.\n\nConsequences for each phase follow directly from the membrane equation:\n\n1) Threshold and generation: Near threshold, action potential initiation occurs when the net inward sodium current exceeds the opposing outward currents, i.e.,\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} > I_{K}+I_{L}.\n$$\nBecause $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ is unaffected and the voltage-gated $I_{K}$ is reduced (indeed, largely eliminated) by the toxin, this inequality is not made harder to satisfy; if anything, it is made easier. Therefore the action potential will still be generated, and there is no elevation of threshold attributable to blocked voltage-gated $K$ channels. This rules out option A.\n\n2) Rising phase (depolarization): The upstroke slope satisfies\n$$\nC_{m}\\,\\frac{dV}{dt}\\approx -I_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\quad \\text{(since } I_{K}\\approx 0 \\text{ and } I_{L}\\text{ is small during the rapid upstroke)}.\n$$\nBecause $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ and its gating ($m,h$) are unchanged, the rising phase is not slowed. This rules out option B.\n\n3) Peak amplitude: The peak occurs when the net membrane current is approximately zero,\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}}+I_{K}+I_{L}\\approx 0.\n$$\nWith $I_{K}\\approx 0$, the balance at the peak is between $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{L}$. This does not make the peak significantly lower; if anything, removing an outward current would permit a peak at a voltage closer to $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ (subject to sodium inactivation), so a markedly lower peak is not expected. Moreover, as shown below, the duration does not remain unchanged. This rules out option C.\n\n4) Falling phase (repolarization): Normally,\n$$\nC_{m}\\,\\frac{dV}{dt}\\approx -I_{K} \\quad \\text{during repolarization,}\n$$\nbecause the outward $K$ current dominates the return toward resting potential once sodium channels inactivate. With $I_{K}\\approx 0$, repolarization must proceed via much smaller currents: sodium current decays due to inactivation ($h$ decreases), and only the leak current $I_{L}$ contributes appreciably to outward current. Consequently, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ in the falling phase has reduced magnitude and the repolarization is significantly prolonged. \n\n5) After-hyperpolarization (AHP): The AHP arises because $g_{K}$ remains elevated briefly after the spike, driving $V$ toward the more negative $E_{K}$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{AHP}}<V_{\\text{rest}} \\quad \\text{when } g_{K}\\text{ is high and } E_{K}<V_{\\text{rest}}.\n$$\nWith voltage-gated $K$ channels blocked ($g_{K}\\to 0$ for the voltage-gated component), this post-spike elevation of $K$ conductance does not occur, so there is no strong drive toward $E_{K}$. The membrane potential returns toward rest without undershoot, i.e., the AHP is absent.\n\n6) Resting membrane potential and spontaneous firing: The resting potential satisfies\n$$\n0=-(I_{\\mathrm{Na,rest}}+I_{K,\\text{VG,rest}}+I_{L}) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad V_{\\text{rest}}\\approx \\frac{g_{L}E_{L}+g_{\\mathrm{Na,rest}}E_{\\mathrm{Na}}+g_{K,\\text{VG,rest}}E_{K}}{g_{L}+g_{\\mathrm{Na,rest}}+g_{K,\\text{VG,rest}}}.\n$$\nVoltage-gated $K$ channels contribute negligibly at rest (they are mostly closed), and the toxin does not affect leak channels or the pump. Therefore $V_{\\text{rest}}$ does not become significantly less negative, and spontaneous uncontrolled firing is not expected. This rules out option E.\n\nPutting these points together, the principal immediate change is a markedly prolonged falling phase (slower repolarization) with elimination of the after-hyperpolarization.
