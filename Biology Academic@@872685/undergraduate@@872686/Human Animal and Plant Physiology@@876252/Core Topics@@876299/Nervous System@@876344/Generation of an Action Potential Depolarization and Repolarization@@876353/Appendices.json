{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The excitability of a neuron—its likelihood of firing an action potential—is not a fixed property, but is critically dependent on the characteristics of its voltage-gated ion channels. This practice problem uses a hypothetical scenario involving a genetic mutation to explore the direct relationship between the action potential threshold and neuronal excitability. Understanding this link is fundamental for grasping both normal synaptic integration and the mechanisms of neurological disorders known as channelopathies [@problem_id:1708797].", "problem": "In a typical mammalian neuron, the resting membrane potential is maintained at approximately -70 mV. An action potential is initiated when a stimulus causes the membrane to depolarize to a threshold potential, at which point voltage-gated sodium channels open. For a normal neuron, this threshold potential is -55 mV.\n\nConsider a scenario where a specific genetic mutation affects the structure of the voltage-gated sodium channels. As a result of this mutation, the channels now require the membrane potential to reach -40 mV before they open. The resting membrane potential of the mutated neuron remains at -70 mV, and all other properties of the neuron, including its ion-channel kinetics and equilibrium potentials, are unchanged.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements best describes the effect of this mutation on the neuron's excitability?\n\nA. The neuron becomes more excitable because the threshold potential is less negative.\n\nB. The neuron becomes less excitable because a greater depolarization is required to reach the threshold.\n\nC. The excitability of the neuron is unchanged because the resting membrane potential has not been altered.\n\nD. The neuron becomes more excitable because sodium ions can enter the cell more rapidly.\n\nE. The neuron becomes less excitable because the peak amplitude of the action potential is reduced.", "solution": "Neuronal excitability reflects how easily a neuron reaches the threshold for initiating an action potential from its resting membrane potential.

This thought experiment is designed to clarify this very point by asking you to predict the immediate effect of shutting down the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$ pump on a single action potential. By focusing on this specific, short-term event, you will reinforce your understanding that the action potential waveform is generated by voltage-gated channels utilizing pre-existing concentration gradients, which are maintained by the pump over the long term [@problem_id:1708802].", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is studying a standard mammalian neuron in vitro. The neuron is maintained in a physiological solution that mimics the extracellular fluid and is at its normal resting membrane potential. The concentration gradients for sodium ($Na^{+}$) and potassium ($K^{+}$) ions are properly established and maintained by the active transport of the sodium-potassium ($Na^{+}/K^{+}$) pump.\n\nAt time $t=0$, two events happen simultaneously:\n1. A powerful and highly specific inhibitor is introduced that instantly and completely blocks all activity of the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$ pump.\n2. The neuron is stimulated just enough to reach its threshold potential, causing it to generate a single action potential.\n\nAssuming the inhibitor has no direct effect on any ion channels, which of the following statements best describes the most likely, immediate effect on the characteristics of this *single* action potential fired at $t=0$, when compared to an action potential fired by an identical neuron without the inhibitor?\n\nA. The repolarization phase would fail to occur, leaving the neuron permanently depolarized.\n\nB. The action potential would have a significantly lower peak amplitude (depolarization would be less positive).\n\nC. The duration of the action potential would be significantly prolonged.\n\nD. Both the depolarization and repolarization phases would occur with essentially normal amplitude and duration.\n\nE. The resting membrane potential would immediately shift to 0 mV, preventing the action potential from occurring at all.", "solution": "We analyze the immediate effects at time $t=0$ on a single action potential when the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$ pump is suddenly and completely inhibited, while voltage-gated ion channels remain unaffected.\n\nFirst, the Nernst potentials for $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ are determined by their transmembrane concentration ratios:\n$$\nE_{Na}=\\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[Na^{+}]_{o}}{[Na^{+}]_{i}}\\right),\\quad\nE_{K}=\\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right).\n$$\nAt $t=0$, blocking the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$ pump does not instantaneously alter $[Na^{+}]_{i}$, $[Na^{+}]_{o}$, $[K^{+}]_{i}$, or $[K^{+}]_{o}$. Therefore, $E_{Na}$ and $E_{K}$ are unchanged at the onset of the action potential.\n\nThe resting membrane potential $V_{m}$ in the presence of ion permeabilities is well approximated by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz relation. In addition, the pump contributes a small electrogenic current $I_{\\text{pump}}$ (net outward positive charge, due to $3$ $Na^{+}$ out for $2$ $K^{+}$ in), which slightly hyperpolarizes the membrane at rest. The membrane equation can be written as\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV_{m}}{dt}=-\\left(I_{Na}+I_{K}+I_{L}+I_{\\text{pump}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $I_{Na}$ and $I_{K}$ are the voltage-gated currents during an action potential, $I_{L}$ is the leak current, and $C_{m}$ is the membrane capacitance. At $t=0^{+}$ after pump blockade, $I_{\\text{pump}}=0$, but during the action potential the magnitudes of $I_{Na}$ and $I_{K}$ dominate the total current. Thus, the removal of $I_{\\text{pump}}$ has a negligible effect on the waveform of a single spike.\n\nDepolarization phase: Upon reaching threshold, voltage-gated sodium channels open, producing a rapid inward $Na^{+}$ current that drives $V_{m}$ toward $E_{Na}$. Since $E_{Na}$ is unchanged and channel kinetics are unaffected, the peak amplitude of depolarization is essentially unchanged.\n\nRepolarization phase: Repolarization is produced by sodium channel inactivation and opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, driving $V_{m}$ toward $E_{K}$. Since $E_{K}$ and channel kinetics are unchanged, the time course and amplitude of repolarization, including the afterhyperpolarization, are essentially unchanged.\n\nIon gradient stability during a single action potential: The number of ions that cross the membrane during one action potential is a tiny fraction of the total intracellular and extracellular ion content. The change in intracellular sodium concentration during one spike satisfies\n$$\n\\Delta[Na^{+}]_{i}=\\frac{1}{F V_{i}}\\int I_{Na}(t)\\,dt,\n$$\nand similarly for $K^{+}$. For a single action potential, $\\int I_{Na}(t)\\,dt$ is small enough that $\\Delta[Na^{+}]_{i}$ and $\\Delta[K^{+}]_{i}$ are negligible compared to baseline concentrations, so $E_{Na}$ and $E_{K}$ remain effectively constant throughout the event.\n\nImmediate versus long-term effects: Although prolonged pump inhibition would, over time, dissipate the gradients and depolarize the cell toward $0$ mV, this process requires substantial ion redistribution and does not occur on the millisecond timescale of a single action potential.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is false because repolarization is mediated by voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels and sodium channel inactivation, not by the pump, and will occur normally for a single spike.\n- Option B is false because $E_{Na}$ is unchanged at $t=0$, so the peak is not significantly reduced.\n- Option C is false because the kinetics and driving forces of $K^{+}$ and $Na^{+}$ are unchanged, so duration is not significantly prolonged.\n- Option E is false because the resting potential does not instantly shift to $0$ mV; gradients are initially unchanged.\n\nHence the correct statement is that both depolarization and repolarization occur with essentially normal amplitude and duration for this single action potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1708802"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative descriptions to quantitative predictions is a key step in mastering physiology.
