The resting membrane potential (Phase 4) is around -90 mV, primarily determined by the high permeability of the membrane to potassium ions ($K^{+}$). When the cell is stimulated to its threshold potential (around -70 mV), the action potential is initiated.\n    *   **Phase 0 (Rapid Depolarization):** This phase is characterized by a rapid and large upstroke in membrane potential, from about -90 mV to +20 mV. This is caused by the opening of fast voltage-gated sodium channels. The large electrochemical gradient for $Na^{+}$ (high concentration outside, low inside) drives a massive and rapid influx of positive charge into the cell.\n\n    *   **Phase 1 (Early Repolarization):** Inactivation of the fast $Na^{+}$ channels and a transient outward current of $K^{+}$.\n\n    *   **Phase 2 (Plateau):** This phase is maintained by a balance between an inward current of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and an outward current of $K^{+}$ through delayed rectifier potassium channels.\n\n    *   **Phase 3 (Rapid Repolarization):** Inactivation of the $Ca^{2+}$ channels and a large increase in outward $K^{+}$ current as more delayed rectifier potassium channels open, returning the membrane potential to its resting level.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Experimental Condition:** The ventricular myocyte is placed in a solution with zero extracellular sodium ($[Na^{+}]_{out} = 0$). This eliminates the chemical gradient that normally drives $Na^{+}$ into the cell.\n\n3.  **Effect on Phase 0:** When the cell is stimulated to the threshold potential, the fast voltage-gated sodium channels will open as they are voltage-dependent, not ligand-dependent. However, because there is no $Na^{+}$ in the extracellular fluid, there can be no influx of sodium ions into the cell. Without this massive influx of positive charge, the rapid depolarization characteristic of Phase 0 cannot occur. The membrane potential will not \"spike\" upwards.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A. The rapid Phase 0 depolarization will occur as normal, but the cell will fail to repolarize in Phase 3.** This is incorrect. Phase 0 is critically dependent on $Na^{+}$ influx, so it will not occur as normal.\n    *   **B. The cell will hyperpolarize, making the membrane potential more negative than the resting potential.** This is incorrect. The stimulus is depolarizing, and the absence of an inward depolarizing current will simply result in a failure to generate an action potential, not hyperpolarization.\n    *   **C. Phase 0 depolarization will be abolished, and the cell will fail to produce a rapid action potential upstroke.** This is the correct description. The absence of extracellular $Na^{+}$ removes the necessary charge carrier for the rapid upstroke.\n    *   **D. The slope of Phase 0 depolarization will be significantly reduced, but a slower, full-amplitude action potential will still be generated, primarily mediated by calcium ions.** This is a plausible but incorrect distractor. While L-type $Ca^{2+}$ channels do open at depolarized potentials, the current they carry ($I_{Ca,L}$) is much smaller and activates much more slowly than the fast $Na^{+}$ current ($I_{Na}$). This slow $Ca^{2+}$ influx is responsible for the plateau (Phase 2) and is the primary depolarization mechanism in sinoatrial (SA) node cells (pacemaker cells), but it cannot generate the rapid, large-amplitude upstroke of a ventricular action potential. The result would be a very small, slow depolarization, not a full-amplitude action potential.\n    *   **E. The resting membrane potential will become significantly more positive, causing the cell to depolarize spontaneously without the external stimulus.** This is incorrect. The resting membrane potential is primarily set by the $K^{+}$ gradient. While the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$ pump activity might be altered, and a minor $Na^{+}$ leak current would cease, the primary effect of removing extracellular $Na^{+}$ is not a significant change in the resting potential but the abolition of the $Na^{+}$-dependent upstroke upon stimulation.\n\nTherefore, the only accurate prediction is the complete failure of the Phase 0 upstroke.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1696570"}, {"introduction": "A cardiac action potential's duration is just as critical as its initiation, and this timing is controlled by the repolarization phase. This practice shifts our focus from the \"on\" switch (depolarization) to the \"off\" switch (repolarization), governed primarily by potassium currents. By analyzing a hypothetical genetic mutation, you will connect a specific change at the ion channel level to its direct consequence on the action potential duration and its clinical correlate, the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) [@problem_id:1696584].", "problem": "A team of clinical geneticists is investigating a family with a rare, heritable cardiac condition. Affected individuals exhibit an unusual pattern on their Electrocardiogram (ECG) but are often asymptomatic. Genetic sequencing reveals a novel \"gain-of-function\" mutation in the *KCNH2* gene. This gene encodes the alpha subunit of a voltage-gated potassium channel that is responsible for the rapid delayed rectifier current ($I_{Kr}$), a key current involved in the repolarization of ventricular cardiomyocytes.\n\nThe specific effect of this gain-of-function mutation is that the channels activate (open) at more negative membrane potentials compared to the normal, or wild-type, channels. In a typical ventricular action potential, the plateau phase (Phase 2) is maintained by a delicate balance between an inward calcium current and outward potassium currents. Repolarization (Phase 3) is initiated when the outward potassium currents, including $I_{Kr}$, begin to dominate.\n\nThe QT interval, measured on a surface ECG, represents the total duration of ventricular electrical activity, from the beginning of depolarization (the start of the QRS complex) to the completion of repolarization (the end of the T wave). It serves as a clinical proxy for the average duration of the ventricular action potential.\n\nBased on the described molecular effect of the mutation, what is the most likely consequence for the ventricular action potential duration and the corresponding QT interval?\n\nA. Shortened action potential duration and a shortened QT interval.\n\nB. Lengthened action potential duration and a lengthened QT interval.\n\nC. No change in action potential duration, but a shortened QT interval.\n\nD. Shortened action potential duration, but a lengthened QT interval.\n\nE. An increase in the amplitude of the QRS complex with no change to the QT interval.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the effect of a specific gain-of-function mutation in a potassium channel on the ventricular action potential duration and the ECG's QT interval.\n\nFirst, let's review the normal sequence of events in a ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential. Phase 0 is the rapid depolarization caused by a large influx of $Na^{+}$ ions. This is followed by a brief initial repolarization (Phase 1). The action potential then enters a plateau phase (Phase 2), where the cell membrane remains depolarized at a positive potential for an extended period. This plateau is the result of a near balance between the influx of positive charge via L-type $Ca^{2+}$ channels and the efflux of positive charge via various potassium channels, including the delayed rectifier channels. Phase 3 is the rapid repolarization phase, where the cell returns to its negative resting potential. This phase is driven by the inactivation of $Ca^{2+}$ channels and the strong activation of delayed rectifier potassium channels, such as the one responsible for the $I_{Kr}$ current, leading to a dominant outward flow of $K^{+}$ ions. Phase 4 is the resting membrane potential.\n\nThe mutation is described as a \"gain-of-function\" in the *KCNH2* gene, which codes for the channel carrying the $I_{Kr}$ current. The specific effect is that the channel activates at more negative membrane potentials. This means the channels will open earlier in the action potential timeline than they normally would.\n\nDuring the plateau phase (Phase 2), the membrane potential is held at a highly positive value (e.g., around +10 mV). Under normal conditions, the $I_{Kr}$ channels begin to activate, contributing a small outward current that helps balance the inward $Ca^{2+}$ current. With the mutation, these channels activate at more negative potentials. This implies that for any given positive potential during the plateau phase, a larger fraction of these mutant channels will be open compared to the wild-type channels.\n\nThis increased activation of the $I_{Kr}$ channels results in a larger outward (repolarizing) potassium current during the plateau phase. This larger outward current will disrupt the delicate balance of Phase 2, more effectively counteracting the inward $Ca^{2+}$ current. As a result, the plateau phase will be terminated sooner, and the cell will enter the rapid repolarization phase (Phase 3) earlier than normal.\n\nThe overall duration of the action potential, known as the Action Potential Duration (APD), is largely determined by the length of the plateau phase. Since the plateau is cut short, the APD will be significantly shortened.\n\nThe QT interval on the ECG is the clinical manifestation of the entire process of ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Therefore, it is directly correlated with the average APD of the ventricular myocytes. A shortened APD will lead to a more rapid completion of ventricular repolarization. This is reflected on the ECG as a shorter time from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave.\n\nIn summary, the gain-of-function mutation increases the repolarizing $K^{+}$ current, which shortens the action potential plateau, which in turn shortens the total action potential duration. This physiological change manifests as a shortened QT interval on the ECG. This condition is clinically known as a form of Short QT Syndrome.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Shortened action potential duration and a shortened QT interval. This aligns perfectly with our reasoning.\nB. Lengthened action potential duration and a lengthened QT interval. This would be expected from a \"loss-of-function\" mutation in a repolarizing potassium channel, which is the opposite of the scenario described.\nC. No change in action potential duration, but a shortened QT interval. This is inconsistent, as the QT interval is a direct reflection of the action potential duration.\nD. Shortened action potential duration, but a lengthened QT interval. This is a contradiction.\nE. An increase in the amplitude of the QRS complex with no change to the QT interval. The QRS complex reflects ventricular depolarization, primarily driven by $Na^{+}$ channels. The mutation affects $K^{+}$ channels involved in repolarization, so it would not primarily affect the QRS complex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1696584"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the shape of a single action potential, we must also consider how this electrical signal propagates from cell to cell.
