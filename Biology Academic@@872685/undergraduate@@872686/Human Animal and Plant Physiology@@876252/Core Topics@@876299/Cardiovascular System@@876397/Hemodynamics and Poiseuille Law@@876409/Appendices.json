Advanced imaging reveals that the internal diameter of the constricted segment is 50% of the diameter of a healthy, non-stenosed segment. Assume that the blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid with a constant viscosity, $\\eta$, and that the flow remains laminar through a rigid, cylindrical vessel of length $L$. To ensure adequate blood supply to the tissues downstream, the volume flow rate of blood, $Q$, through the stenosed segment must be kept the same as it would be through a healthy segment of the same length and under the same conditions. By what factor must the pressure difference across the length $L$ of the stenosed segment increase compared to the pressure difference that would be required for a healthy segment?
