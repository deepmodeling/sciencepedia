To prevent the blood from coagulating prematurely in the collection tube, the researcher adds a solution of sodium citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant. After preparing the sample, the goal is to initiate the coagulation process *in vitro* to perform the measurement. The researcher has access to several sterile, aqueous solutions. The coagulation cascade, a series of enzymatic activations, requires several factors, some of which are dependent on the presence of specific ions to function correctly.\n\nGiven this context, which one of the following solutions, when added in a sufficient molar excess to the citrated blood plasma, would be most effective at reversing the specific anticoagulant action of citrate and allowing the complete intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways to proceed?\n\nA.

A solution of sodium chloride ($NaCl$)", "solution": "1) Identify the specific anticoagulant action to be reversed: Citrate prevents coagulation by chelating divalent calcium ions required for multiple steps of the coagulation cascade. The key equilibrium is calcium–citrate complexation:\n$$\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} + \\mathrm{Cit^{3-}} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CaCit^{-}},$$\nwith an associated formation constant $K_{\\mathrm{f,Cit}}$. This reduces the free calcium concentration $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ below that required for coagulation factor function.\n\n2) State the biochemical requirement: Multiple serine proteases in the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways (notably factors II, VII, IX, and X) require $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ to bind to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces via their gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing domains. Thus, restoring $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ is necessary and sufficient to allow the complete pathways to proceed.\n\n3) Apply mass balance and Le Chatelier’s principle: Let $[{\\mathrm{Ca}}]_{T}$ be the total calcium concentration added and $[{\\mathrm{Cit}}]_{T}$ the total citrate concentration. With complexation restricted for illustration to the dominant 1:1 species,\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}} = [{\\mathrm{Ca}}]_{T} - [\\mathrm{CaCit^{-}}],$$\nand\n$$K_{\\mathrm{f,Cit}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{CaCit^{-}}]}{[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}[\\mathrm{Cit^{3-}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}}.$$\nAdding $\\mathrm{CaCl_{2}}$ in sufficient molar excess drives the equilibrium so that, after saturating citrate binding sites, a positive residual $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ remains:\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}} \\approx [{\\mathrm{Ca}}]_{T} - [{\\mathrm{Cit}}]_{T} \\quad \\text{when } [{\\mathrm{Ca}}]_{T} \\gg [{\\mathrm{Cit}}]_{T},$$\nrestoring coagulation.\n\n4) Evaluate each option mechanistically:\n- A (EDTA): EDTA is a stronger chelator of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ than citrate. The equilibrium\n$$\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} + \\mathrm{EDTA^{4-}} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CaEDTA^{2-}}$$\nhas $K_{\\mathrm{f,EDTA}} \\gg K_{\\mathrm{f,Cit}}$, further decreasing $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ and preventing coagulation. This does not reverse citrate’s action.\n- B (Vitamin K): Vitamin K is a cofactor for hepatic gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that post-translationally modifies factors II, VII, IX, and X in vivo. Adding vitamin K to plasma does not acutely increase $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ nor does it generate new functional factors ex vivo; it does not reverse citrate chelation.\n- C ($\\mathrm{CaCl_{2}}$): Supplies $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ directly. In sufficient molar excess, it overcomes citrate chelation and restores $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$, allowing the complete intrinsic and extrinsic pathways to proceed. This is the standard laboratory “recalcification” step.\n- D (Thrombin): While thrombin can convert fibrinogen to fibrin,\n$$\\mathrm{Fibrinogen} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{Thrombin}} \\mathrm{Fibrin},$$\nthis bypasses upstream activation steps and does not reverse citrate’s sequestration of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$. It would not allow assessment of the complete pathways and also downstream stabilization by factor XIII requires $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$.\n- E ($\\mathrm{NaCl}$): Increases ionic strength but provides no $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$; it does not displace citrate-bound calcium or restore the required $[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$.\n\n5) Conclusion: Only adding $\\mathrm{CaCl_{2}}$ in sufficient excess effectively reverses citrate’s anticoagulant action and permits the full coagulation cascade to proceed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1710992"}, {"introduction": "Before the fibrin mesh of secondary hemostasis can form, a rapid response is needed at the site of vessel injury.

Prothrombin time (PT) evaluates the extrinsic and common pathways; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) evaluates the intrinsic and common pathways. Normal PT and aPTT indicate that the coagulation cascade is intact and argue against a defect in secondary hemostasis.\n3) By definition, thrombocytopenia is present when the platelet count $P$ is below the normal lower limit; symbolically, if $P<P_{\\min}$, then thrombocytopenia.
