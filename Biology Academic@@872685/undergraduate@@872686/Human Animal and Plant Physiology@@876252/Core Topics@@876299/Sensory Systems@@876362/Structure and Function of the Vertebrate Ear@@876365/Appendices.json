The scala media is filled with endolymph, a fluid with an unusually high potassium ion concentration, $[K^+] \\approx 150 \\text{ mM}$, and a large positive electrical potential of approximately $+80 \\text{ mV}$ relative to the surrounding tissue. This is known as the endocochlear potential. The hair cells, responsible for converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, sit with their apical stereocilia bathed in this endolymph. The intracellular environment of a hair cell has a potassium concentration of $[K^+] \\approx 140 \\text{ mM}$ and a resting membrane potential of approximately $-45 \\text{ mV}$ relative to the perilymph.

This practice employs a mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of the resulting traveling wave along the membrane. By doing so, you will see how its distinct physical properties directly explain a key psychoacoustic phenomenon: the asymmetric nature of auditory masking [@problem_id:1744791].", "problem": "In the field of psychoacoustics, an interesting phenomenon known as auditory masking describes how the perception of one sound (the signal) is affected by the presence of another sound (the masker). A key observation is that a low-frequency tone is a more effective masker for a nearby high-frequency tone than the reverse. This asymmetry can be understood by modeling the mechanical response of the basilar membrane in the inner ear.\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional model of the basilar membrane. The position along the membrane, $x$, is measured in millimeters (mm) from the stapes (the base). The membrane is tonotopically organized, meaning each position $x$ has a characteristic frequency $f_c(x)$ to which it responds most strongly. This relationship is given by:\n$$f_c(x) = f_{base} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_0}\\right)$$\nwhere $f_{base} = 20000 \\text{ Hz}$ is the characteristic frequency at the base, and $L_0 = 5.00 \\text{ mm}$ is a characteristic length.\n\nWhen a pure tone of a certain frequency is introduced, it creates a traveling wave along the basilar membrane, causing displacement. The envelope of this displacement (its maximum amplitude at each point) for a stimulus tone that peaks at position $x_s$ with a maximum amplitude of $A_0$ is modeled by the following asymmetric function of position $x$:\n$$A(x; x_s) = \\begin{cases} A_0 \\exp\\left( -k_{up} (x_s - x) \\right) & \\text{for } x \\le x_s \\\\ A_0 \\exp\\left( -k_{down} (x - x_s) \\right) & \\text{for } x > x_s \\end{cases}$$\nThe parameters $k_{up} = 0.100 \\text{ mm}^{-1}$ and $k_{down} = 0.800 \\text{ mm}^{-1}$ describe the gradual rise of the wave envelope toward the peak and the sharp fall-off after the peak, respectively.\n\nLet's investigate the masking interaction between two tones: a low-frequency tone $f_L = 2000 \\text{ Hz}$ and a high-frequency tone $f_H = 4000 \\text{ Hz}$. Assume both tones, when presented alone, produce the same peak displacement amplitude $A_0$. The masking effectiveness of a masker tone on a signal tone is defined as the displacement amplitude the masker creates at the signal tone's characteristic position on the membrane.

The acoustic reflex, mediated by the tiny stapedius muscle in the middle ear, is a prime example of such regulation. This problem asks you to analyze a scenario where this protective reflex is lost, clarifying its crucial role in modulating sound transmission for high-intensity stimuli and preventing the perception of normal sounds as uncomfortably loud [@problem_id:1744803].", "problem": "The middle ear contains the ossicles, a chain of three small bones that transmit sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the oval window of the cochlea. The stapedius muscle, the smallest skeletal muscle in the human body, attaches to the stapes, the final bone in this chain. In a healthy individual, this muscle contracts reflexively in response to high-intensity sounds.

A reduced ability to perceive low-volume speech in a quiet environment.\n\nB. Difficulty localizing the source of a sound in the horizontal plane.\n\nC.

A selective and progressive loss of hearing for high-frequency sounds (above 10,000 Hz).\n\nE. The inability to perceive any sound transmitted through bone conduction.", "solution": "In normal hearing, sound pressure at the tympanic membrane is transmitted via the ossicles to the stapes footplate at the oval window, driving fluid motion in the cochlea. The stapes and ossicular chain can be modeled as a driven damped system, where the amplitude of stapes displacement in response to a force of amplitude $F_{0}$ at angular frequency $\\omega$ is reduced by greater effective stiffness and damping. A standard linear form for the steady-state amplitude is\n$$\nx(\\omega)=\\frac{F_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\left(k-m\\omega^{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(b\\omega\\right)^{2}}},\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the effective mass, $k$ the effective stiffness, and $b$ the effective damping of the ossicular chain and associated muscles and ligaments. \n\nThe stapedius muscle contracts reflexively during high-intensity sounds (the acoustic reflex), increasing the effective stiffness $k$ (and contributing to damping), thereby decreasing $x(\\omega)$ for a given $F_{0}$. This attenuates transmission through the middle ear, particularly at lower frequencies, protecting the inner ear and expanding the comfortable dynamic range of hearing at high intensities. With the stapedius functioning, high-intensity inputs yield reduced stapes excursion, reducing perceived loudness and potential cochlear overstimulation.\n\nIf the stapedius muscle is completely and permanently paralyzed on one side while the cochlea and auditory nerve remain normal, the acoustic reflex cannot be engaged on that side. Consequently, for high-intensity and even many everyday sounds, the effective stiffness does not increase, so for the same input $F_{0}$, the stapes displacement $x(\\omega)$ is larger than it would be with an intact reflex. The result is an increased perceived loudness for sounds of normal daily intensity, known as hyperacusis, on the affected side.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because baseline transmission of low-intensity sounds is not reduced; if anything, sensitivity is increased when the reflex would otherwise attenuate.\n- B is not the primary effect; horizontal localization relies on binaural interaural time and level differences, and there is no primary conductive or sensorineural loss here. The main deficit is not localization.\n- C is correct: loss of the stapedius reflex leads to hyperacusis, where everyday sounds are uncomfortably loud.\n- D is incorrect; selective high-frequency loss suggests sensorineural pathology such as presbycusis, not stapedius paralysis.\n- E is incorrect; bone conduction bypasses the middle ear, and with a normal cochlea and nerve, bone-conducted sound perception remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the primary auditory consequence is hyperacusis to everyday sounds on the affected side.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1744803"}]}
