{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The ability of our muscles to produce a wide range of forces, from a gentle touch to a powerful lift, begins with the behavior of a single motor unit. The force generated by a motor unit is not an all-or-nothing event; it is finely tuned by the frequency of nerve impulses it receives. This first exercise [@problem_id:1720534] explores these fundamental responses, challenging you to distinguish between a single twitch, the rippling force of unfused tetanus, and the smooth, maximal contraction of fused tetanus based on stimulation patterns. Mastering these concepts is the first step toward understanding the principle of rate coding.", "problem": "In a physiology laboratory, a researcher isolates a single motor unit from the gastrocnemius muscle of a rat, which is known for containing fast-twitch glycolytic fibers. The preparation is mounted on a force transducer that measures tension. The researcher aims to characterize the contractile properties by applying electrical stimuli of constant, suprathreshold voltage but varying frequencies. Three distinct patterns of tension generation are recorded, described below:\n\n**Observation X**: A single electrical pulse is delivered to the motor neuron. The muscle fibers respond by contracting and then completely relaxing over a period of about 50 milliseconds, generating a single, well-defined peak of tension.\n\n**Observation Y**: A continuous train of electrical pulses is delivered at a frequency such that a new stimulus arrives before the muscle fibers have fully relaxed from the previous one. The resulting tension is sustained at a high level, but it visibly oscillates, showing small dips in tension between successive stimuli. The average tension is significantly greater than that of a single contraction from Observation X.\n\n**Observation Z**: The frequency of the electrical pulse train is increased significantly. The muscle fibers contract to produce a level of tension that is smooth, sustained, and maximal. There are no discernible oscillations or relaxations in tension for as long as the stimulus train is applied.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following correctly identifies the physiological phenomena described in X, Y, and Z?\n\nA. X: Unfused tetanus, Y: Fused tetanus, Z: Single twitch\n\nB. X: Single twitch, Y: Unfused tetanus, Z: Fused tetanus\n\nC. X: Single twitch, Y: Fused tetanus, Z: Unfused tetanus\n\nD. X: Fused tetanus, Y: Single twitch, Z: Unfused tetanus\n\nE. X: Wave summation, Y: Single twitch, Z: Fused tetanus", "solution": "We identify each observation based on standard skeletal muscle responses to electrical stimulation, using the principles of excitation-contraction coupling and temporal summation.\n\nObservation X: A single suprathreshold pulse elicits one contraction-relaxation cycle with complete relaxation and a single peak in tension over about 50 milliseconds. This is the definition of a single twitch.\n\nObservation Y: A stimulus train arrives such that each new stimulus occurs before complete relaxation from the previous contraction. The tension is elevated with visible oscillations (partial relaxations between stimuli). This pattern reflects temporal (wave) summation that does not fully smooth out, known as unfused (incomplete) tetanus.\n\nObservation Z: Increasing the stimulus frequency further results in a smooth, sustained, maximal tension without discernible oscillations. This is fused (complete) tetanus, where high-frequency stimulation maintains cytosolic calcium at a level supporting continuous cross-bridge cycling without relaxation.\n\nThus, the correct mapping is: X: Single twitch, Y: Unfused tetanus, Z: Fused tetanus, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1720534"}, {"introduction": "While a single motor unit's behavior is key, a whole muscle contains hundreds of such units that the central nervous system must coordinate. The CNS uses two primary strategies to grade muscle force: recruiting more motor units and increasing the firing rate of already active ones (rate coding). This practice [@problem_id:1720533] bridges theory and application by asking you to interpret a common clinical and research tool—the electromyogram (EMG). You will analyze how the electrical signature of a muscle changes during a graded contraction, linking observable signal features back to the simultaneous processes of recruitment and rate coding.", "problem": "A student in a kinesiology lab is performing a sustained, graded isometric contraction of their biceps brachii muscle, gradually increasing the force from nearly zero to their maximum voluntary contraction over a period of ten seconds. A surface Electromyography (EMG) system, which records the summed electrical activity of the muscle, is used to monitor the contraction. As the student increases the force exerted by the muscle, two distinct changes are observed in the raw EMG signal:\n\n1.  The overall amplitude of the signal, representing the peak-to-peak voltage, progressively increases.\n2.  The signal becomes significantly \"denser,\" indicative of an increase in the number of individual voltage spikes detected per unit of time.\n\nThe Central Nervous System (CNS) modulates muscle force primarily through two distinct strategies: motor unit recruitment (activating a greater number of motor units) and rate coding (increasing the firing frequency of already active motor units).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physiological explanation for the combination of these two observations in the EMG signal as muscle force increases?\n\nA. The increase in signal amplitude is caused by rate coding, while the increase in signal density is caused by the recruitment of more motor units.\n\nB. The increase in both signal amplitude and density is primarily caused by the synchronization of all available motor units, causing them to fire in perfect unison.\n\nC. The increase in signal amplitude is primarily due to the recruitment of additional and progressively larger motor units, while the increase in signal density reflects the increased firing frequency (rate coding) of the active motor units.\n\nD. The increase in signal amplitude is due to an increase in the action potential amplitude of individual muscle fibers, and the increase in density is due to recruitment.\n\nE. The increase in both signal amplitude and density is solely attributable to rate coding, as the number of active motor units remains constant after the initial onset of contraction.", "solution": "We interpret the two observed changes in the raw surface EMG during a graded isometric contraction: (1) increasing peak-to-peak amplitude and (2) increasing “density” (more spikes per unit time). The CNS modulates force via two primary mechanisms: recruiting more motor units (motor unit recruitment, following Henneman’s size principle) and increasing the firing frequency of active motor units (rate coding).\n\nFirst, the increase in EMG amplitude. The surface EMG amplitude reflects the algebraic summation of motor unit action potentials detected by the electrodes. As force increases from low to high, the CNS recruits additional motor units in an orderly fashion (smaller, fatigue-resistant units first, then progressively larger, higher-threshold units). Each newly recruited motor unit contributes its motor unit action potentials to the summed signal, and larger motor units generally have larger motor unit action potentials at the surface due to greater numbers of fibers and spatial summation. Thus, as recruitment progresses, the composite EMG signal amplitude increases. Therefore, the increase in EMG amplitude is primarily explained by recruitment of additional and progressively larger motor units.\n\nSecond, the increase in EMG “density.” The density refers to the number of discernible spikes per unit time in the raw EMG, which is directly influenced by how frequently the active motor units discharge action potentials. As the CNS increases force, it not only recruits more units but also increases the firing rates of the already active units (rate coding). Higher firing frequency means more action potentials per unit time from each active motor unit, which manifests as a denser EMG signal. Therefore, the increase in signal density is primarily explained by rate coding.\n\nNow, evaluate the options:\nA. Incorrect. This reverses the principal mechanisms. Amplitude is mainly driven by recruitment; density is mainly driven by rate coding.\nB. Incorrect. Perfect synchronization is neither physiologically accurate nor the dominant mechanism in graded force production. Increased synchronization would tend to produce more temporally aligned spikes (peaky bursts) rather than a uniformly denser signal, and it cannot account for the systematic amplitude increase across the full force range.\nC. Correct. It correctly assigns amplitude increases to recruitment (including progressively larger units per the size principle) and density increases to rate coding of active units.\nD. Incorrect. The amplitude of individual muscle fiber action potentials does not increase with voluntary drive in the manner proposed; AP amplitude is relatively constant. Hence EMG amplitude changes are not due to increased individual fiber AP amplitude.\nE. Incorrect. The number of active motor units does not remain constant after contraction onset; recruitment continues over a substantial force range, so changes cannot be solely attributed to rate coding.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physiological explanation is that amplitude increases with recruitment (and recruitment of larger units) and density increases with rate coding, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1720533"}, {"introduction": "The recruitment of motor units is not random; it follows a precise rule known as Henneman's size principle, where smaller motor neurons are activated before larger ones. Furthermore, the innervating neuron dictates the physiological characteristics of the muscle fibers it controls, such as their resistance to fatigue. This problem [@problem_id:1720496] presents a classic nerve-cross reinnervation scenario, a powerful thought experiment in neurophysiology. It will challenge you to apply the size principle and the concept of neural determination of muscle phenotype to predict the new functional properties and recruitment order within a reorganized muscle.", "problem": "An exercise physiologist is studying a simplified model of a mammalian muscle containing three distinct motor units: M1, M2, and M3. The recruitment of a motor unit is triggered when the total excitatory synaptic current to its motor neuron's soma exceeds a threshold current, $I_{th}$. This threshold current is directly proportional to the surface area of the neuron's soma, which is modeled as a sphere. The fatigue resistance of a motor unit is quantified by its Fatigue Index (FI), defined as the ratio of tetanic force after 2 minutes of sustained stimulation to the initial peak force. A higher FI indicates greater fatigue resistance.\n\nThe initial properties of the motor units are as follows:\n- **Motor Unit M1**: Innervated by a motor neuron with a soma radius of $r_1 = 15 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. It consists of slow-twitch (Type I) muscle fibers and has a Fatigue Index of $FI_1 = 0.90$.\n- **Motor Unit M2**: Innervated by a motor neuron with a soma radius of $r_2 = 25 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. It consists of fast fatigue-resistant (Type IIa) muscle fibers and has a Fatigue Index of $FI_2 = 0.60$.\n- **Motor Unit M3**: Innervated by a motor neuron with a soma radius of $r_3 = 40 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. It consists of fast-fatigable (Type IIx) muscle fibers and has a Fatigue Index of $FI_3 = 0.15$.\n\nA nerve-cross experiment is performed. The axon of the motor neuron for M3 is severed and microsurgically connected to the muscle fibers previously belonging to M1, whose own motor neuron has been surgically removed. The M3 neuron's original muscle fibers are now denervated, so M3 ceases to be a functional motor unit. This newly formed motor unit, consisting of the M3 neuron and M1 fibers, is designated M1'. It is established that the phenotype of muscle fibers is determined by the firing pattern and trophic factors from the innervating neuron. Consequently, the reinnervated muscle fibers of M1' adopt the physiological properties (including FI) corresponding to the neuron that now innervates them. The motor unit M2 remains unchanged.\n\nThe muscle now consists of two functional motor units: the modified M1' and the original M2. Based on the information provided, determine the new recruitment order of these two motor units during a graded contraction and the new Fatigue Index of M1' ($FI_{1'}$).\n\nSelect the correct option from the choices below.\n\nA. Recruitment Order: M1' then M2; $FI_{1'} = 0.15$\n\nB. Recruitment Order: M1' then M2; $FI_{1'} = 0.90$\n\nC. Recruitment Order: M2 then M1'; $FI_{1'} = 0.15$\n\nD. Recruitment Order: M2 then M1'; $FI_{1'} = 0.60$\n\nE. Recruitment Order: M2 then M1'; $FI_{1'} = 0.90$", "solution": "The threshold current for recruitment is proportional to the soma surface area. Modeling the soma as a sphere of radius $r$, the surface area is\n$$\nS = 4 \\pi r^{2}.\n$$\nIf $I_{\\text{th}}$ denotes the threshold current, the stated proportionality implies\n$$\nI_{\\text{th}} = \\alpha S = 4 \\pi \\alpha r^{2}, \\quad \\alpha > 0.\n$$\nTherefore, for any two motor neurons $i$ and $j$,\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\text{th},i}}{I_{\\text{th},j}} = \\frac{r_{i}^{2}}{r_{j}^{2}}.\n$$\nRecruitment during graded contraction proceeds from the smallest $I_{\\text{th}}$ to the largest, equivalently from the smallest $r$ to the largest (size principle).\n\nAfter the nerve-cross procedure, motor unit M1' is innervated by the neuron originally belonging to M3; hence its soma radius equals that of M3:\n$$\nr_{1'} = r_{3}.\n$$\nMotor unit M2 remains unchanged with radius $r_{2}$. Given $r_{2} = 25$ and $r_{3} = 40$ (in consistent length units), we have $r_{2} < r_{3}$, so\n$$\nI_{\\text{th},2} < I_{\\text{th},1'}.\n$$\nThus, the recruitment order is M2 first, then M1'.\n\nFor fatigue properties, the problem states that muscle fiber phenotype, including Fatigue Index, is determined by the innervating neuron. Therefore, the reinnervated M1' fibers adopt the properties of the M3 neuron, giving\n$$\nFI_{1'} = FI_{3} = 0.15.\n$$\nCombining these results yields the option with recruitment order M2 then M1' and $FI_{1'} = 0.15$, namely option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1720496"}]}
