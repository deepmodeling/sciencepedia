For this cell, the maximum diastolic potential (the most negative potential reached) is -65 mV, and the threshold potential for firing an action potential is -40 mV.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:1696847] challenges you to deduce the function of a specific ionic current, the transient outward current ($I_{to}$), by predicting how its absence would alter the action potential's morphology, thereby highlighting the contribution of individual currents to the overall electrical event.", "problem": "In the development of a novel antiarrhythmic medication, a research team synthesizes a compound, \"Ventrablock,\" designed to specifically target ion channels in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Initial electrophysiological studies reveal that Ventrablock is a potent and highly selective blocker of the voltage-gated potassium channels responsible for the transient outward current, often denoted as $I_{to}$. This current is known to be a key factor in shaping the early phase of the ventricular action potential.\n\nAssuming all other ion channels and cellular mechanisms remain unaffected, which of the following describes the most direct and primary consequence of applying a therapeutic dose of Ventrablock on the morphology of a single ventricular myocyte action potential?\n\nA.

Therefore, substantial shortening is incorrect.\n- Option D: Removing the principal Phase 1 outward current reduces or abolishes the early repolarization notch, and the plateau starts at a more positive voltage. This is the direct primary effect.\n- Option E: Late Phase 3 repolarization rate is governed mainly by $I_{Kr}$, $I_{Ks}$, and $I_{K1}$; selective $I_{to}$ block does not significantly increase it and may even reduce repolarization reserve.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and primary consequence is the reduction or elimination of the Phase 1 notch with a more positive onset of the plateau, which corresponds to Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1696847"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate purpose of the cardiac action potential is to initiate mechanical contraction, a process known as excitation-contraction coupling.
