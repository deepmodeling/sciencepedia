This first practice challenges you to use a simple histochemical test—staining for starch with an iodine solution—to identify the primary storage tissue in a potato tuber. By predicting the outcome, you will reinforce your knowledge of parenchyma cells and their vital role in nutrient storage [@problem_id:1732068].", "problem": "A plant biologist is investigating the tissue composition of a potato tuber, a modified stem specialized for nutrient storage. A thin cross-section of the tuber is prepared and mounted on a microscope slide. The biologist knows that the ground tissue system in plants is composed of three main cell types: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma. To differentiate these tissues based on their function within the tuber, the biologist applies an iodine-potassium iodide (I2-KI) solution, which is known to change from its native yellowish-brown color to a deep blue-black in the presence of starch.\n\nBased on the primary function of a potato tuber and the characteristic roles of the plant ground tissues, what is the most likely observation after the staining procedure?\n\nA. All visible cells, regardless of wall thickness or shape, will stain a uniform, deep blue-black.\n\nB. Only the cells with unevenly thickened primary walls, typically found in clusters just beneath the epidermis, will stain blue-black.\n\nC. Only the cells with very thick, lignified secondary walls, which often appear empty at maturity, will stain blue-black.\n\nD. Large, isodiametric cells with thin primary walls, which constitute the bulk of the tuber's internal tissue, will stain blue-black, while other tissues remain yellowish-brown.\n\nE. The entire tissue section will remain yellowish-brown, indicating none of the ground tissues in the tuber contain the target substance.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the outcome of staining a potato tuber cross-section with an iodine-potassium iodide (I2-KI) solution. This requires understanding the function of the I2-KI solution and the primary functions and structures of the three ground tissue types: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma.\n\nFirst, let's establish the principle of the chemical test. The iodine-potassium iodide solution is a classic indicator for the presence of starch. The polyiodide ions (primarily I3-) formed in the solution intercalate within the helical structure of amylose, a component of starch, forming a starch-iodine complex. This complex absorbs light differently than the solution alone, resulting in a characteristic deep blue-black color. The native color of the I2-KI solution is yellowish-brown. Therefore, the staining procedure is designed to locate starch within the plant tissue.\n\nNext, we must consider the functions of the three ground tissue types and their relevance to a potato tuber.\n1.  **Parenchyma**: These are typically living cells with thin primary walls. They are metabolically active and perform a wide variety of functions, including photosynthesis (in chlorenchyma), secretion, and, most importantly for this problem, storage of food reserves like starch, proteins, and lipids. Structurally, they are often large and roughly spherical or isodiametric. In storage organs like a potato tuber, parenchyma cells are specialized for starch storage, with their cytoplasm packed with starch-filled plastids called amyloplasts.\n\n2.  **Collenchyma**: These are living cells characterized by unevenly thickened primary walls, which provide flexible support to growing parts of the plant, such as young stems and leaf petioles. Their primary function is mechanical support, not storage. Therefore, they do not typically contain significant amounts of starch.\n\n3.  **Sclerenchyma**: These cells have thick, rigid secondary walls that are heavily lignified. Their primary function is to provide structural support and hardness to the plant. Mature sclerenchyma cells (like fibers and sclereids) are often dead and lack a protoplast. Their role is purely mechanical, and they do not store starch.\n\nA potato tuber is a modified stem whose primary function is to store energy for the plant, predominantly in the form of starch. The bulk of the fleshy part of a potato tuber is composed of storage parenchyma.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n-   **A. All visible cells... will stain... blue-black.** This is incorrect. Only tissues specialized for starch storage will stain. The protective outer layers (periderm) and any vascular tissues (xylem, phloem) or potential structural tissues would not be primarily storing starch.\n-   **B. Only the cells with unevenly thickened primary walls... will stain blue-black.** This describes collenchyma. Collenchyma's function is support, not starch storage. This option is incorrect.\n-   **C. Only the cells with very thick, lignified secondary walls... will stain blue-black.** This describes sclerenchyma. Sclerenchyma's function is rigid support, not storage, and the cells are often dead at maturity. This option is incorrect.\n-   **D. Large, isodiametric cells with thin primary walls... will stain blue-black...** This accurately describes the morphology of parenchyma cells. Given that the potato tuber's main role is starch storage, these parenchyma cells, which make up most of the tissue, will be filled with starch. Therefore, they will react with the iodine solution to produce a blue-black color. Other tissues, not being specialized for storage, will not react and will retain the yellowish-brown color of the iodine stain. This is the correct prediction.\n-   **E. The entire tissue section will remain yellowish-brown...** This would imply a complete absence of starch, which contradicts the fundamental biological function of a potato tuber as a starch storage organ. This option is incorrect.\n\nThus, the iodine will selectively stain the starch-filled parenchyma cells, which are characterized as being large with thin walls and making up the majority of the tuber's tissue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1732068"}, {"introduction": "While simple stains can identify specific cell contents, more advanced techniques allow for the simultaneous differentiation of multiple tissue types based on their fundamental chemistry. This problem introduces you to the power of a metachromatic stain, which changes color in response to different cell wall components like lignin and pectin. Your task is to identify the correct staining protocol to visualize parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma all at once, a common challenge in plant anatomy research [@problem_id:1732081].", "problem": "A plant physiologist is examining a transverse section of a *Pyrus* (pear) petiole to study the distribution and chemical nature of its ground tissues. The petiole is known to contain three primary types of ground tissue cells: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma (specifically, stone cells or sclereids). The chemical composition of their walls is well-established:\n- **Parenchyma** cells have thin primary walls composed mainly of cellulose.\n- **Collenchyma** cells provide flexible support and have unevenly thickened primary walls rich in pectic substances.\n- **Sclerenchyma** cells provide rigid support and have thick, lignified secondary walls.\n\nThe physiologist wants to use a single, well-established staining protocol that can simultaneously differentiate all three cell types in one preparation based on their distinct wall chemistries. The desired outcome is a specific color palette: lignified sclerenchyma walls should appear brilliant blue-green, pectin-rich collenchyma walls should appear reddish-purple, and cellulosic parenchyma walls should appear a simple shade of blue.\n\nWhich of the following histochemical staining reagents, used under appropriate pH conditions, would be capable of producing this specific polychromatic result?\n\nA.

Phloroglucinol-HCl (Wiesner reaction): a specific test for lignin that yields a cherry-red to magenta coloration in lignified walls. It is not a polychromatic stain and does not simultaneously differentiate pectins or cellulose; hence it cannot produce the stated three-color differentiation.\n\nB. Safranin followed by Fast Green: a classic double stain; Safranin typically stains lignified tissues red, and Fast Green stains cellulose-containing tissues green. While it differentiates lignified vs non-lignified, it does not produce the specified palette (lignin blue-green, pectin reddish-purple, cellulose blue), nor does it distinctly highlight pectin-rich collenchyma as reddish-purple via metachromasia.\n\nC. Ruthenium Red: a stain for pectic substances and mucilage, giving a red coloration to pectin. It does not simultaneously differentiate lignin and cellulose into the required colors and thus does not produce the desired polychromatic outcome across all three tissues.\n\nD. Toluidine Blue O (TBO): a basic metachromatic dye whose color depends on substrate chemistry and pH. Under appropriate mildly acidic conditions, TBO exhibits:\n- Orthochromasia on cellulose, yielding blue.\n- Metachromasia on pectin-rich regions, yielding reddish-purple.\n- Characteristic blue-green to greenish-turquoise on lignified tissues due to interactions with lignin.\nThis matches exactly the requested palette: lignified sclerenchyma blue-green, pectin-rich collenchyma reddish-purple, and cellulosic parenchyma blue.\n\nE. Aniline Blue: primarily stains callose and is used for sieve plates and pollen tubes; it does not provide the required simultaneous differentiation of lignin, pectin, and cellulose with the specified colors.\n\nTherefore, only Toluidine Blue O, used under appropriate pH conditions, produces the specified polychromatic differentiation corresponding to the wall chemistries of sclerenchyma, collenchyma, and parenchyma.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1732081"}, {"introduction": "The distinct structural properties of each ground tissue are not accidental; they are the result of evolutionary adaptation for specific functions. This final exercise is a thought experiment that asks you to predict the functional consequences of replacing a plant's storage parenchyma with supportive collenchyma. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario, you can solidify your understanding of why cell structure is critically important for the overall function and survival of the plant [@problem_id:1732067].", "problem": "Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a genetic modification causes a potato plant (*Solanum tuberosum*) to develop its tubers using collenchyma cells instead of the naturally occurring storage parenchyma cells. The fundamental metabolic processes for starch synthesis remain unchanged. Considering the distinct structural characteristics of these two ground tissue cell types, which of the following describes the most significant functional compromise for the potato tuber?\n\nA. The tuber would be unable to sprout new plants because collenchyma cells are dead at maturity and cannot divide.\n\nB. The tuber's ability to defend against soil pathogens would be critically weakened due to the chemical composition of collenchyma cell walls.\n\nC. The total energy storage capacity of the tuber would be drastically reduced, impairing its primary role as a reserve organ.\n\nD. The tuber would lose its structural integrity and turgor, becoming soft and unable to retain its shape.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the distinct functions and structural features of parenchyma and collenchyma within ground tissues. Storage parenchyma in tubers consists of living cells with thin primary walls, large vacuoles, and abundant amyloplasts; these traits maximize cytoplasmic and vacuolar volume for the accumulation of starch and water, enabling the tuber to act as a high-capacity reserve organ. In contrast, collenchyma consists of living cells specialized for flexible support, characterized by unevenly thickened primary cell walls rich in pectins and cellulose; these thickened walls occupy space that would otherwise be available for storage, and collenchyma cells are typically elongated with smaller lumens relative to storage parenchyma.\n\nGiven the premise that the metabolic machinery for starch synthesis remains unchanged, the key determinant of reserve capacity becomes the physical and cellular architecture of the tissue. Replacing thin-walled, voluminous storage parenchyma with thick-walled collenchyma would reduce the cellular lumen and vacuolar space and would likely reduce the number and volume of amyloplasts per unit tissue. Therefore, the total volume fraction available for starch deposition and water storage decreases substantially, directly impairing the tuber’s principal function as a storage organ.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. This is incorrect because collenchyma cells are living at maturity, not dead; it is sclerenchyma that is dead at maturity. Moreover, sprouting arises from axillary buds (meristems) present at the tuber “eyes,” not from generalized ground tissue cell division, so substituting collenchyma would not, by itself, prevent sprouting on the basis claimed.\n\nB. This is not the most significant effect. Both collenchyma and parenchyma possess primary walls largely of cellulose and pectins; the tuber’s pathogen defense is dominated by the periderm and suberized tissues, along with chemical defenses from specialized cells, rather than a fundamental difference in collenchyma versus parenchyma wall chemistry. Any change in wall composition here would not be the principal compromise relative to storage function.\n\nC. This is the most significant compromise. Thickened primary walls and elongated cell shape in collenchyma reduce lumen volume and vacuolar space, limiting amyloplast abundance and size. Even with unchanged metabolic capacity, the physical storage capacity per unit volume of tissue is drastically reduced, directly undermining the tuber’s primary role as a starch reserve.\n\nD. This is incorrect in direction. Collenchyma contributes to flexible support and relies on turgor; its presence would not cause loss of structural integrity or softness. If anything, increased wall thickening would tend to make tissues firmer, not less able to retain shape.\n\nTherefore, the most significant functional compromise is the substantial reduction in storage capacity, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1732067"}]}
