The standard protocol involves a polymerase chain reaction with DNA polymerase, the template DNA, a specific primer, all four types of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and a small amount of four different fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs). A ddNTP lacks the 3'-hydroxyl group required for the formation of a phosphodiester bond, and its incorporation into a growing DNA strand leads to chain termination.\n\nDue to a miscalculation while preparing the reagents, the student creates a reaction mixture where the concentration of each dNTP is exactly equal to the concentration of its corresponding ddNTP. For example, the concentration of dATP is equal to the concentration of ddATP, the concentration of dCTP is equal to the concentration of ddCTP, and so on for all four bases. After the reaction is complete, the resulting DNA fragments are separated by size via capillary gel electrophoresis, and the fluorescence signal is recorded to generate an electropherogram, which plots fluorescence intensity versus fragment length.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome on the electropherogram?\n\nA. A clear and strong sequence reading for the entire 400 base pair template, because the polymerase can still select the correct nucleotide at each step.\n\nB. The signal intensity will be very weak for the shortest fragments and will increase significantly for longer fragments, yielding a clear sequence only for the far end of the template.\n\nC. No fluorescent signal will be detected because the equimolar concentration of ddNTPs completely inhibits the DNA polymerase from initiating synthesis.\n\nD. The signal intensity will be extremely high for the very shortest fragments and will decrease exponentially as fragment length increases, rendering the sequence unreadable beyond the first several bases.\n\nE. A sequence of random bases will be generated because the polymerase cannot distinguish between the different ddNTPs.", "solution": "In Sanger sequencing, DNA synthesis proceeds by template-directed incorporation of the correct base; termination occurs only when a dideoxynucleoside triphosphate (ddNTP) is incorporated, because ddNTPs lack the 3'-hydroxyl necessary for forming the next phosphodiester bond. Thus, elongation is a sequence of independent incorporation events at which the polymerase must choose between a normal deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), which allows continuation, and the corresponding ddNTP, which causes termination, all while preserving Watson-Crick base selectivity.\n\nLet $p$ denote the probability that, at any given incorporation step, the polymerase incorporates the ddNTP for the correct base (termination), and let $q$ denote the probability of incorporating the corresponding dNTP (continuation), with\n$$\np+q=1.\n$$\nEquimolar concentrations of dNTP and ddNTP for each base imply that the polymerase faces ddNTP and dNTP at comparable frequency for any given correct base; hence $p$ is not negligible and, in fact, $p \\approx q$.\n\nThe length distribution of terminated fragments is geometric: to obtain a fragment of length $k$ nucleotides (terminated at the $k$-th incorporation), the polymerase must have continued for $k-1$ steps and then terminated at step $k$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Pr(L=k)=q^{k-1}p,\n$$\nand the survival (not-yet-terminated) probability to at least length $k$ is\n$$\n\\Pr(L\\geq k)=q^{k-1}.\n$$\nSince $0<q<1$ and equimolar conditions give $q$ not close to $1$, the abundance of fragments decreases exponentially with length. Consequently:\n- There will be a very high number of very short terminated fragments (large signal at the shortest lengths).\n- The abundance, and thus fluorescence intensity, will decay approximately exponentially with increasing fragment length, making longer fragments increasingly rare.\n- Polymerase initiation is not inhibited; initiation occurs from the primed template, and termination only happens upon ddNTP incorporation during elongation.\n- Base selection remains accurate (complementarity governs selection between A/T and G/C); ddNTP versus dNTP changes termination, not base identity.\n\nMapping fragment abundance to electropherogram signal (fluorescence intensity proportional to the number of fragments of a given length), the electropherogram will show extremely high signal for the shortest fragments with an exponential decrease as length increases, causing the read to become unreadable beyond the first several bases due to low intensity and poor peak resolution.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: although correct base selection occurs, frequent termination prevents a clear, strong read across the full length.\n- B is incorrect: the pattern is the opposite; intensity does not increase with length.\n- C is incorrect: initiation and synthesis occur; ddNTPs do not prevent initiation, they terminate elongation upon incorporation.\n- D is correct: very high signal for very short fragments with exponential decay in intensity, making later sequence unreadable.\n- E is incorrect: base identity remains determined by template complementarity; the issue is termination frequency, not random base incorporation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2337141"}, {"introduction": "In the real world, laboratory results are not always perfect, and a common source of error is sample contamination.

In the reaction, a DNA polymerase extends from this primer in the presence of all four dNTPs and small amounts of fluorescently labeled ddNTPs. Incorporation of a ddNTP terminates extension, producing a population of fragments that differ by one nucleotide in length. Capillary electrophoresis separates these fragments by size, and the detector records the fluorescent dye at the terminus of each length class. The observed chromatogram is thus the superposition of signals from all extension products generated from all template molecules that were primed.\n\nIn this scenario, there are two different plasmid templates present in significant amounts, and both contain the same perfect priming site. Therefore, both templates will be primed and extended in parallel, generating two independent ladders of terminated fragments, one for each template.\n\nFor positions immediately downstream of the primer where the two templates have identical sequence, both ladders will produce the same terminal base for each length class, so the electropherogram will show clean, single-color peaks corresponding to that shared base (with peak height reflecting the summed signal from both templates).\n\nAt the first position where the two templates differ, one template will contribute terminated fragments bearing one base while the other template contributes fragments bearing a different base at the same length. Because capillary electrophoresis resolves by fragment length, the two different terminal bases corresponding to that same position will co-migrate as two different-colored peaks at essentially the same position in the trace. From this divergence onward, unless the sequences happen to realign by chance, most subsequent positions will continue to show two different bases contributed by the two templates, yielding two superimposed, different-colored peaks at nearly every position. The relative heights of the paired peaks will reflect the relative abundances of the two templates but will not eliminate the overlap given that both are present in significant amounts.\n\nThis behavior rules out the alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because the less abundant template still produces discernible peaks; the trace will not be clean for only the more abundant template.\n- B is incorrect because there is no mechanism for an abrupt loss of signal at a fixed point due to template mixture; extension continues on both templates.\n- D is incorrect because, at any given position, at most two different bases are expected across two templates, not four, and the initial identical region will appear clean.\n- E is incorrect because Sanger reads are not hybrids within a single molecule; the chromatogram is a superposition of two distinct reads, not a random intermixing into a coherent single-base call.\n\nTherefore, the expected chromatogram is clean where the sequences are identical, and from the first divergence shows two superimposed, different-colored peaks at most subsequent positions, making the sequence unreadable, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2337110"}]}
