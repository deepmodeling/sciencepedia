The experimental plan involves fractionating a sample of cultured human fibroblasts using differential centrifugation.\n\nThe protocol is as follows:\nFirst, the cells are suspended in an isotonic buffer and gently homogenized to rupture the cell membranes while keeping the organelles largely intact. This initial mixture is the **homogenate**. This homogenate is then subjected to a series of centrifugation steps.\n\n1.  The homogenate is centrifuged at a low speed (1,000 x g for 10 minutes).

The final supernatant", "solution": "Identify the target and its physical state: Globular actin (G-actin) is the monomeric, soluble form of actin that resides in the cytosol. By definition, soluble cytosolic proteins do not sediment at low or medium centrifugal forces that pellet intact organelles and large structures.\n\nApply the principle of differential centrifugation: Centrifugation separates components primarily by size, density, and shape under a centrifugal acceleration that scales with angular speed and radius. Large and dense structures (e.g., nuclei, intact cells) sediment at low speeds; intermediate-sized organelles (e.g., mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes) pellet at medium speeds; small vesicles, ribosomes, and especially freely soluble proteins typically remain in the supernatant unless subjected to very high speeds (ultracentrifugation).\n\nAnalyze each fraction against the goal of maximizing soluble, monomeric G-actin:\n- Option A (homogenate): Contains all cellular components (organelles, membranes, cytosol, cytoskeletal polymers). It is not enriched for soluble G-actin and includes polymerized actin and binding partners, so it is not optimal for isolating the highest concentration of free monomers.\n- Option B (nuclear fraction): The low-speed pellet is enriched in nuclei and unbroken cells; soluble cytosolic proteins are largely absent except for minor carryover. This pellet is not a source of soluble monomeric G-actin.\n- Option C (mitochondrial fraction): The medium-speed pellet contains mitochondria and other intermediate organelles. Soluble cytosolic proteins, including G-actin, do not preferentially pellet here and thus are not enriched in this fraction.\n- Option D (final supernatant): After removing nuclei and mitochondria by low and medium speeds, the remaining supernatant is the cytosolic fraction. Soluble proteins, including monomeric G-actin, remain in this liquid phase and thus are at their highest relative concentration here compared with organelle pellets.\n\nConclusion: To obtain the highest concentration of soluble, monomeric G-actin, the researcher should use the final supernatant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2307703"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical knowledge of centrifugation is essential, but a successful experiment hinges on flawless practical execution. Even the most well-designed fractionation scheme will fail if the initial steps are not performed correctly. This next practice problem [@problem_id:2307679] presents a common and realistic troubleshooting scenario where the experimental result—a pellet full of intact cells instead of nuclei—does not match the expectation. Solving it requires you to think critically like an experimentalist, diagnosing the procedural flaw by working backward from the evidence.", "problem": "A cell biologist is working to isolate functional nuclei from a culture of human hepatocytes (liver cells) for use in a transcription run-on assay. The standard protocol begins with harvesting the cells and resuspending them in a chilled, isotonic buffer containing a mild non-ionic detergent. The cell suspension is then subjected to mechanical homogenization using a Dounce homogenizer to break the plasma membranes while leaving the nuclear envelopes intact. The resulting homogenate is then centrifuged at 800 x g for 15 minutes to pellet the nuclei. Upon examining a sample of the resulting pellet under a light microscope, the biologist is surprised to find that it consists predominantly of intact, spherical hepatocytes, with very few free nuclei visible. Which of the following is the most probable cause of this poor outcome and the most appropriate corrective action?\n\nA. The centrifugation speed of 800 x g was too low to effectively pellet the dense nuclei, which remained in the supernatant. The speed should be increased significantly.\n\nB. The buffer was hypertonic, causing the cells to shrink and become so dense that they pelleted alongside the nuclei. The buffer's solute concentration should be decreased.\n\nC. The homogenization procedure was too gentle or too brief, failing to rupture the plasma membranes of most cells. The number of strokes or the force used during homogenization should be increased.\n\nD. The non-ionic detergent was too harsh, causing the nuclear envelope to lyse and release the chromatin, which was then lost in the supernatant. A milder detergent or no detergent should be used.\n\nE. The centrifugation time of 15 minutes was excessively long, leading to the co-sedimentation of smaller organelles like mitochondria with the nuclei. The spin time should be shortened.", "solution": "The goal of this procedure is to perform differential centrifugation to separate cellular components based on their size and density. The first step in fractionating animal cells is typically a low-speed centrifugation step designed to pellet the largest and densest organelle: the nucleus.\n\nLet's analyze the observed result. The researcher found that the pellet, which should have been enriched with nuclei, was instead mostly composed of intact hepatocytes. Intact cells are much larger and more massive than any individual organelle, including the nucleus. Therefore, during a centrifugation step, if intact cells are present in the suspension, they will sediment and form a pellet at even very low centrifugal forces.\n\nThe protocol involves two key stages before centrifugation:\n1.  Suspending cells in a specific buffer.\n2.  Mechanically homogenizing the cells to lyse them (break their plasma membranes).\n\nThe problem states that the pellet is full of intact cells. This indicates that the cells were never successfully lysed in the first place. If the cells are not broken open, their contents, including the nucleus, are not released into the suspension to be fractionated. The homogenization step is the one responsible for physically breaking the cell membranes. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the homogenization step was ineffective.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. This is incorrect. A centrifugation speed of 600-1000 x g is standard for pelleting nuclei. Furthermore, if the speed were too low, the result would be a very small pellet (or no pellet) and a cloudy supernatant containing the un-pelleted nuclei. This contradicts the observation of a pellet composed of intact cells. Intact cells are larger and heavier than free nuclei, so they would pellet even more readily at this speed.\n\nB. This is incorrect. A hypertonic buffer would cause cells to lose water and shrink (crenate). While this changes their density, it does not explain the failure to lyse. The primary issue is the integrity of the plasma membrane, not the cell's hydration state. The homogenization step is still required to break the cells, regardless of the buffer's tonicity.\n\nC. This is the correct explanation. Mechanical homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer relies on shear forces to break the plasma membrane. If the procedure is too gentle (e.g., the pestle is too loose-fitting, or not enough passes or \"strokes\" are performed), the shear forces will be insufficient to rupture the resilient plasma membrane of many cells. These unlysed cells remain in the homogenate and, being the largest particles present, are easily pelleted at 800 x g. The appropriate corrective action is to apply a more rigorous homogenization to ensure a high percentage of cell lysis.\n\nD. This is incorrect. If the detergent were too harsh and lysed the nuclei, the researcher would observe a very small or non-existent nuclear pellet. The nuclear contents (chromatin) would be released into the suspension and would not pellet at such a low speed. This is the opposite of the described problem, which is a pellet of large, intact cells.\n\nE. This is incorrect. A long centrifugation time ensures that all particles that *can* sediment at a given speed will do so, leading to a more complete separation. While excessively long spins at higher speeds can cause contamination with smaller components, the primary contaminant here is intact cells, not smaller organelles. Shortening the spin time would likely result in an even less efficient procedure, where some nuclei and intact cells might remain in the supernatant, but it would not solve the fundamental problem of failed cell lysis. The presence of intact cells in the pellet is the core issue, not contamination by smaller organelles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2307679"}, {"introduction": "Once you have successfully fractionated a cell homogenate and isolated a fraction enriched with your protein of interest, how do you measure your success?
