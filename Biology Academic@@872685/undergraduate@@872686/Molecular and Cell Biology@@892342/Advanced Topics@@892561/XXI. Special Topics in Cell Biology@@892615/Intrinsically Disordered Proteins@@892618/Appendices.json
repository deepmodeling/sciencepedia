This process is often driven by Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), which utilize a \"stickers and spacers\" architecture. \"Stickers\" are residues that form attractive intermolecular contacts (e.g., aromatic or charged groups), while \"spacers\" are flexible linkers that allow these contacts to form. By tuning the number and arrangement of stickers, a cell can control the material properties of condensates.\n\nA biophysicist is studying a specific IDP and its ability to form condensates. A simplified mean-field model suggests that the saturation concentration, $c_{sat}$, above which the IDP undergoes phase separation, follows the relationship:\n$$c_{sat} = c_{ref} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{N_s^{2} \\epsilon_{eff}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $c_{ref}$ is a protein-specific reference concentration, $N_s$ is the number of aromatic \"sticker\" residues in the IDP sequence, $\\epsilon_{eff}$ is an effective interaction energy parameter per sticker pair, and $k_B T$ is the thermal energy. The term $N_s^2$ reflects the mean-field assumption that each sticker on a chain can potentially interact with all other stickers on neighboring chains.\n\nThe wild-type (WT) version of the IDP has $N_{s,WT} = 12$ aromatic residues and is observed to form liquid-like droplets at a saturation concentration of $c_{sat,WT} = 120.0$ µM at a temperature of 298 K.\n\nTo probe the system, a first mutant (MUT1) was created by substituting 4 non-aromatic residues with aromatic ones, resulting in a protein with $N_{s,MUT1} = 16$ aromatic residues.
