The unit written as “...pyranose” (or “...furanose”) is the glycosyl acceptor: it retains a free anomeric center (reducing end) and is the second monosaccharide unit.\n\n2) The anomeric descriptor $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ placed before the donor residue refers to the configuration at the donor’s anomeric carbon as it participates in the glycosidic bond. The acceptor’s anomeric configuration is not specified because its anomeric carbon is free.\n\n3) The linkage notation $(1\\rightarrow 4)$ indicates that the glycosidic bond connects the donor’s C1 to the acceptor’s C4.\n\nApply these rules to the given name $\\beta$-D-galactopyranosyl-$(1\\rightarrow 4)$-D-glucopyranose:\n- “galactopyranosyl” identifies the first (donor) unit as D-galactose.\n- “glucopyranose” identifies the second (acceptor) unit as D-glucose.\n- The leading $\\beta$ specifies that the glycosidic linkage has $\\beta$ configuration at the donor anomeric center.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is: first monosaccharide D-galactose, second monosaccharide D-glucose, with a $\\beta$ glycosidic bond, which matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2318163"}, {"introduction": "The type of glycosidic linkage in a carbohydrate does more than just hold monosaccharides together; it defines the molecule's overall shape and its chemical properties. This exercise explores one of the most fundamental of these properties: whether a sugar is \"reducing\" or \"non-reducing.\" By comparing the structures of maltose and the unique disaccharide trehalose, you will discover how the involvement of anomeric carbons in the bond directly determines a sugar's chemical reactivity [@problem_id:2318166].", "problem": "In carbohydrate chemistry, a sugar is classified as a 'reducing sugar' if its structure contains a free hemiacetal or hemiketal group. This functional group allows the sugar's cyclic form to open into its open-chain form, which possesses a reactive aldehyde or ketone group capable of reducing an oxidizing agent (such as in Benedict's or Tollens' test). In cyclic monosaccharides like glucose, the anomeric carbon (carbon-1 in aldoses) is part of the hemiacetal group.\n\nConsider two disaccharides, both composed of two $\\alpha$-D-glucose units:\n1.  **Maltose**: The two glucose units are joined by an $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow4)$ glycosidic bond. This means the anomeric carbon of the first glucose unit is bonded to the hydroxyl group on carbon-4 of the second glucose unit.\n2.  **Trehalose**: The two glucose units are joined by an $\\alpha,\\alpha(1\\leftrightarrow1)$ glycosidic bond. This notation signifies that the anomeric carbon of the first glucose unit is bonded to the anomeric carbon of the second glucose unit.\n\nExperimentally, maltose is found to be a reducing sugar, while trehalose is a non-reducing sugar. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate chemical reason for this observation?\n\nA. Trehalose cannot be a reducing sugar because the $\\alpha,\\alpha(1\\leftrightarrow1)$ linkage is between two identical monomers; reducing sugars require a linkage between two different types of monosaccharides.\n\nB. The $\\alpha,\\alpha(1\\leftrightarrow1)$ glycosidic bond in trehalose is significantly more stable and resistant to hydrolysis than the $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow4)$ bond in maltose, which prevents the rings from opening.\n\nC. In trehalose, the anomeric carbons of both glucose units are consumed in the formation of the glycosidic bond, leaving no free hemiacetal groups. In maltose, one glucose unit retains a free anomeric carbon that is part of a hemiacetal.\n\nD. Both disaccharides are reducing sugars, but the reactivity of trehalose is so low due to steric hindrance that it gives a false negative result in standard chemical tests.\n\nE. The symmetrical nature of the $\\alpha,\\alpha(1\\leftrightarrow1)$ bond in trehalose causes the reducing properties of the two anomeric carbons to cancel each other out.", "solution": "The defining characteristic of a reducing sugar is the presence of a free hemiacetal group. A hemiacetal in a cyclic sugar is in equilibrium with its open-chain aldehyde form. It is this aldehyde group that can be oxidized, allowing the sugar to act as a reducing agent. The carbon atom that is part of the hemiacetal group is known as the anomeric carbon.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each disaccharide based on the provided information.\n\n**Analysis of Maltose:**\nMaltose consists of two $\\alpha$-D-glucose units linked by an $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow4)$ glycosidic bond.\nThe first glucose unit (let's call it Glucose A) uses its anomeric carbon (C1) to form the bond with the hydroxyl group on carbon-4 of the second glucose unit (Glucose B). In this process, the hemiacetal of Glucose A is converted into a full acetal, and its anomeric carbon is \"locked\" in the glycosidic bond.\nHowever, the anomeric carbon (C1) of Glucose B is not involved in this glycosidic linkage. It remains as part of a hemiacetal group. This free hemiacetal on the second glucose unit can open up to form an aldehyde group.\nBecause maltose has a part of its structure that can form a free aldehyde, it is classified as a reducing sugar.\n\n**Analysis of Trehalose:**\nTrehalose consists of two $\\alpha$-D-glucose units linked by an $\\alpha,\\alpha(1\\leftrightarrow1)$ glycosidic bond.\nIn this unique linkage, the anomeric carbon (C1) of the first glucose unit is bonded directly to the anomeric carbon (C1) of the second glucose unit.\nThis means that the anomeric carbons of *both* glucose units are involved in the a glycosidic bond. As a result, both former hemiacetal groups have been converted into a full acetal linkage (specifically, a glycosidic bond involving two anomeric positions).\nThere are no free hemiacetal groups anywhere in the trehalose molecule. Without a hemiacetal group, neither ring can open to expose a reactive aldehyde group.\nTherefore, trehalose is unable to act as a reducing agent and is classified as a non-reducing sugar.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\nA. This is incorrect. Maltose is a reducing sugar and is also made of two identical monomers (glucose).\nB. While the stability of the bond is a factor in the overall chemistry of the molecule, the direct and fundamental reason for its non-reducing nature is the absence of a free hemiacetal, not the bond's stability relative to other linkages.\nC. This statement correctly identifies the key structural difference. In trehalose, both anomeric carbons are participating in the bond, so there is no free hemiacetal. In maltose, the anomeric carbon of the second glucose unit is free, forming a hemiacetal that allows it to be a reducing sugar. This is the most accurate explanation.\nD. This is incorrect. Trehalose is fundamentally a non-reducing sugar due to its structure, not because of low reactivity or steric hindrance giving a false negative. Sucrose is another common example of a non-reducing sugar for the same structural reason.\nE. This explanation is chemically inaccurate. Reducing properties do not \"cancel out\" in this manner. The property is based on the presence or absence of a specific functional group (the hemiacetal).\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2318166"}, {"introduction": "How do scientists determine the precise three-dimensional arrangement of a newly discovered carbohydrate?

The key unresolved question is the stereoselectivity of the enzyme; it is unknown whether it preferentially forms an $\\alpha(1 \\rightarrow 4)$ or a $\\beta(1 \\rightarrow 4)$ linkage.\n\nTo determine this, the enzymatic reaction was allowed to proceed to completion. The resulting mixture of disaccharide products was purified and analyzed by high-resolution $^{1}\\text{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The analysis focused on the signals corresponding to the anomeric proton (H1) of the former donor sugar, which is now part of the new glycosidic bond.

This geometry, relative to the adjacent axial proton (H2), typically results in a small three-bond coupling constant ($^3J_{\\text{H1,H2}}$) in the range of 2–4 Hz. The equatorial proton is relatively deshielded, appearing at a chemical shift ($\\delta$) of approximately 4.8–5.5 ppm.\n- A **$\\beta$-linkage** places the anomeric proton (H1) in an **axial** orientation. The resulting trans-diaxial relationship with the adjacent axial proton (H2) leads to a large three-bond coupling constant ($^3J_{\\text{H1,H2}}$) in the range of 7–9 Hz. The axial proton is more shielded, appearing at a chemical shift ($\\delta$) of approximately 4.4–4.8 ppm.\n\nBased on the provided experimental NMR data and these established principles, calculate the stereoselectivity of the enzyme.
