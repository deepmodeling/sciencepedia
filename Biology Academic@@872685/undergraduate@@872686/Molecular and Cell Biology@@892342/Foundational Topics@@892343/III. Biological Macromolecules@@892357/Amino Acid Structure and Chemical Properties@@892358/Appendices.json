By comparing the environmental pH to the $pKa$ values of its ionizable groups, we can predict whether each group is protonated or deprotonated, and thus determine the molecule's overall net charge. This exercise provides foundational practice in this essential skill, which is critical for understanding protein function and for designing biochemical purification methods.", "problem": "A biochemist is preparing a buffer solution containing the free amino acid lysine for an experiment.

The isoelectric point ($pI$) of a molecule is the specific pH at which its net electrical charge is zero. In a typical IEF setup, a pH gradient is established in a gel matrix.

The $pI$ occurs when the average charge is zero, which is achieved when the concentrations of the $+1$ and $-1$ forms are equal, i.e., $[X^{+}] = [Y^{-}]$, because the neutral form carries no charge.\n\nThe relevant equilibria and Henderson–Hasselbalch relations are:\n$$\npH = pKa_{R} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[Z^{0}]}{[X^{+}]}\\right), \\quad\npH = pKa_{2} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[Y^{-}]}{[Z^{0}]}\\right).\n$$\nMultiplying the corresponding ratios gives\n$$\n\\frac{[Y^{-}]}{[X^{+}]} = 10^{\\left(pH - pKa_{R}\\right)} \\cdot 10^{\\left(pH - pKa_{2}\\right)} = 10^{\\,2\\,pH - \\left(pKa_{R} + pKa_{2}\\right)}.\n$$\nAt $pI$, impose $[Y^{-}] = [X^{+}]$, hence\n$$\n10^{\\,2\\,pH - \\left(pKa_{R} + pKa_{2}\\right)} = 1 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 2\\,pH - \\left(pKa_{R} + pKa_{2}\\right) = 0,\n$$\nso\n$$\npI = \\frac{pKa_{R} + pKa_{2}}{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\npI = \\frac{6.00 + 9.17}{2} = 7.585 \\approx 7.59 \\text{ (to three significant figures).}\n$$\nThe $\\alpha$-carboxyl $pKa_{1}$ does not enter this average because the neutral (zwitterionic) form of histidine lies between $pKa_{R}$ and $pKa_{2}$ on the titration curve.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.59}$$", "id": "2303334"}, {"introduction": "Determining the primary structure—the linear sequence of amino acids—is a cornerstone of protein analysis. In the lab, this is often accomplished by using a combination of chemical and enzymatic methods to generate smaller, overlapping peptide fragments that can be sequenced and reassembled.

They perform a series of experiments and obtain the following results:\n\n1.  A single cycle of Edman degradation, a procedure that sequentially removes and identifies the N-terminal amino acid of a peptide, yields phenylthiohydantoin-methionine (PTH-Met).\n\n2.  Enzymatic digestion of the pentapeptide with chymotrypsin, an endopeptidase that specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of large aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine), produces two distinct fragments. One fragment is a tripeptide with the sequence Met-Ala-Trp. The other fragment is a dipeptide composed of one arginine residue and one cysteine residue.\n\n3.  Separate enzymatic digestion of the original pentapeptide with trypsin, an endopeptidase that specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of positively charged amino acids (arginine and lysine), results in two fragments: a tetrapeptide and a single, free cysteine amino acid.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the complete and correct primary sequence of the pentapeptide, written from N-terminus to C-terminus?\n\nA.

Met-Trp-Ala-Arg-Cys", "solution": "Edman degradation identifies the N-terminal residue as methionine, so the pentapeptide begins with Met.\n\nChymotrypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr, Phe). The appearance of a tripeptide Met-Ala-Trp implies that Trp is at the C-terminus of this fragment, so the N-terminal three residues of the intact peptide are Met-Ala-Trp. The other chymotryptic fragment is a dipeptide containing Arg and Cys, but this does not fix their order.\n\nTrypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Arg and Lys. The tryptic digestion yields two products: a tetrapeptide and a single free cysteine. For a free cysteine to be released as a single residue, trypsin must cleave immediately before Cys at an Arg, making Cys the C-terminal residue of the original peptide and placing Arg directly before it. Thus the C-terminal dipeptide is Arg-Cys.\n\nCombining these constraints gives the full sequence Met-Ala-Trp-Arg-Cys, which also reproduces all observations: Edman gives Met; chymotrypsin yields Met-Ala-Trp and Arg-Cys; trypsin yields Met-Ala-Trp-Arg and free Cys.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2303298"}]}
