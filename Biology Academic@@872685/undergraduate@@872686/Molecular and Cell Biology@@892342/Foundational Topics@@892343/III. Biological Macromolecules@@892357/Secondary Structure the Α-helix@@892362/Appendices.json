This foundational structure is defined by two key parameters: the pitch, which is the vertical distance of one full turn, and the rise, the distance each amino acid contributes along the central axis. This first exercise guides you through a fundamental calculation that reveals the repeating pattern of the helix by determining exactly how many residues are required to complete a single turn [@problem_id:2074844].", "problem": "A biochemist is analyzing the three-dimensional structure of a newly synthesized peptide that exclusively folds into a stable right-handed α-helix conformation. Using high-resolution structural analysis techniques, the biochemist obtains two key measurements. The first is the pitch of the helix, defined as the vertical distance along the helical axis corresponding to one complete turn, which is measured to be $5.4$ angstroms ($\\AA$). The second is the rise per residue, which is the axial distance contributed by each amino acid residue, measured to be $1.5 \\AA$.\n\nBased on these experimental values, calculate the number of amino acid residues present in a single complete turn of this α-helix.", "solution": "Define $P$ as the pitch (axial distance per full helical turn), $r$ as the rise per residue (axial distance per amino acid), and $N$ as the number of residues per turn. By the definition of pitch and rise, the total axial distance covered in one turn by $N$ residues is\n$$\nP = N r.\n$$\nSolving for $N$ gives\n$$\nN = \\frac{P}{r}.\n$$\nSubstituting the measured values $P = 5.4$ angstroms and $r = 1.5$ angstroms, the units cancel, yielding\n$$\nN = \\frac{5.4}{1.5} = 3.6.\n$$\nThus, there are $3.6$ amino acid residues per complete turn of the $\\alpha$-helix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.6}$$", "id": "2074844"}, {"introduction": "Having established the core geometry of the helix, we can now apply this knowledge to a critical biological context. The precise, repeating structure of the α-helix makes it an ideal building block for protein domains that need to span a specific distance, such as traversing a cell membrane's lipid bilayer.
