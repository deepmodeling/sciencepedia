They are working with a non-virulent R-strain of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. However, their particular R-strain is known to have a genetic instability, causing it to spontaneously revert to a virulent, encapsulated S-strain at a very low rate. This creates a background \"noise\" that could be mistaken for transformation.\n\nThe experiment involves injecting a mouse with a mixture containing a large number of live R-strain cells and an extract from heat-killed S-strain cells. The researchers define the \"transformation efficiency\" ($E_T$) as the fraction of the initial R-strain cells that are successfully transformed into S-strain cells by the extract. The spontaneous reversion is characterized by a \"reversion frequency\" ($f_{rev}$), which is the probability of a reversion event occurring per cell division.\n\nIn a specific experiment, an initial population of $N_R = 2.0 \\times 10^8$ live R-strain cells is used. The R-strain population undergoes a total of $D_{total} = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}$ cell divisions during the course of the infection inside the mouse. The reversion frequency for this R-strain is measured to be $f_{rev} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ events per cell division.\n\nFor the experimental result to be considered a conclusive demonstration of transformation, the researchers establish a strict criterion: the number of S-strain cells originating from transformation must account for at least 99% of the total S-strain cells observed.\n\nAssuming that each transformation or reversion event gives rise to a single lineage of S-strain cells, what is the minimum transformation efficiency, $E_T$, that must be achieved to satisfy this criterion?

To truly grasp their logic, we must be able to apply it to novel situations.

The principle is isolated from heat-killed S-type bacteria.\n\nA novel hypothesis is proposed: the transforming principle is a stable, covalent DNA-protein adduct. In this model, the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) component carries the genetic information for the polysaccharide capsule that confers virulence. The protein component, however, serves as a necessary shuttle, being absolutely required for the uptake of the entire adduct into the recipient R-type cells. The protein itself has no genetic function.\n\nTwo parallel experiments are conducted on separate, identical aliquots of the isolated transforming principle:\n1.  **Experiment 1**: The aliquot is treated with a purified protease, an enzyme that completely and specifically hydrolyzes all peptide bonds, thus destroying proteins.\n2.  **Experiment 2**: The aliquot is treated with a purified Deoxyribonuclease (DNase), an enzyme that completely and specifically hydrolyzes the phosphodiester backbone of DNA.\n\nFollowing each treatment, the resulting mixture is added to a fresh culture of living R-type cells and incubated under conditions that would normally allow for transformation.

By the hypothesis, $P$ is absolutely required for uptake of the adduct; without $P$, $D$ cannot enter R-type cells. Therefore, even if $D$ remains chemically intact, there is no cellular uptake and thus no transformation.\n\nExperiment 2 (DNase treatment):\n- Reaction: $$D\\text{-}P \\xrightarrow{\\text{DNase}} \\text{oligonucleotides/mononucleotides} + P.$$\n- Consequence: The DNA $D$ is degraded, eliminating the genetic information required for capsule synthesis. Even if $P$ could mediate uptake, there is no intact $D$ to confer heritable change. Therefore, no transformation occurs.\n\nPrediction:\n- After protease (Experiment 1): No transformation (uptake blocked due to absence of $P$).\n- After DNase (Experiment 2): No transformation (genetic information destroyed due to absence of intact $D$).\n\nThus, transformation will not be observed after either treatment, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315411"}, {"introduction": "The 1952 Hershey-Chase experiment provided powerful, independent evidence for DNA as the genetic material using bacteriophages labeled with radioactive isotopes.
