This problem presents a classic chemical puzzle: why D-fructose, a ketose, gives a positive test with Tollen's reagent, a test typically used to detect aldoses. Solving this requires you to look beyond the static structure and consider the base-catalyzed isomerization that connects ketoses and aldoses, a key principle in carbohydrate chemistry. [@problem_id:2325491]", "problem": "Tollen's reagent, an alkaline solution containing the diamminesilver(I) complex, $[\\text{Ag(NH}_3)_2]^+$, is a classical qualitative test in organic chemistry. It serves as a mild oxidizing agent used to differentiate between aldehydes and ketones. Aldehydes are oxidized to carboxylates, and the silver(I) ions are reduced to elemental silver, which deposits as a characteristic \"silver mirror\" on the inner surface of the reaction vessel (a positive test). Most ketones, being more resistant to oxidation, do not react with Tollen's reagent (a negative test).\n\nMonosaccharides can be classified as aldoses (containing an aldehyde group) or ketoses (containing a ketone group). Based on the general reactivity rule, one would expect aldoses to give a positive Tollen's test and ketoses to give a negative test.

Under the basic conditions of the Tollen's test, D-fructose undergoes an isomerization to form an equilibrium mixture containing aldoses, which are then oxidized.\n\nB.
