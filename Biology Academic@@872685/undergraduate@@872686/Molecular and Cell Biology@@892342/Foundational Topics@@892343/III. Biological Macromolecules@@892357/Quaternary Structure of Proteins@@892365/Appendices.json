This exercise simulates a real-world biochemical investigation, where you must act as a detective to piece together clues from multiple experimental techniques. By integrating data from size-exclusion chromatography (native mass), non-reducing SDS-PAGE (disulfide-linked assemblies), and reducing SDS-PAGE (individual polypeptide masses), you can deduce the precise arrangement of subunits in a complex protein. [@problem_id:2334519] This practice will sharpen your ability to synthesize different data types into a single, cohesive model of a protein's quaternary structure.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a newly discovered protein called Quartase, which is believed to play a role in cellular adhesion. To determine its subunit composition and quaternary structure, a series of experiments are conducted. The results are as follows:\n\n1.  **Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC):** When the native, fully folded Quartase is analyzed by SEC, it elutes as a single peak corresponding to a molecular weight of 240 kDa.\n\n2.  **SDS-PAGE (Non-reducing):** An aliquot of Quartase is treated with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) but without any reducing agent. When this sample is run on a Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) gel, two distinct bands are observed. These bands correspond to molecular weights of 160 kDa and 80 kDa.\n\n3.  **SDS-PAGE (Reducing):** Another aliquot of Quartase is treated with SDS and a strong reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol. When this sample is analyzed by SDS-PAGE, two bands are again observed, but this time at molecular weights of 80 kDa and 40 kDa. A densitometry scan of this gel indicates that the total mass of protein contained within the 40 kDa band is twice the total mass of protein contained within the 80 kDa band.\n\nBased on this complete set of experimental data, determine the correct subunit composition of a single native Quartase molecule.\n\nA. Two 80 kDa subunits and two 40 kDa subunits.\n\nB. Three 80 kDa subunits.\n\nC. One 80 kDa subunit and four 40 kDa subunits.\n\nD. Six 40 kDa subunits.\n\nE. A single polypeptide chain of 240 kDa.", "solution": "Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on the native protein reports the apparent molecular mass of the intact quaternary complex. Therefore, the native Quartase has total mass\n$$M_{\\text{native}}=240\\ \\text{kDa}.$$\n\nSDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions denatures noncovalent quaternary interactions while retaining disulfide bonds. The observation of two bands at 160 kDa and 80 kDa implies that, upon denaturation without reduction, the covalently linked (disulfide-bonded) units resolve into one species of 160 kDa and one species of 80 kDa. Their masses sum to the native mass, consistent with a complex composed of a disulfide-linked block of 160 kDa and an 80 kDa unit that is not disulfide-linked to the 160 kDa block.\n\nSDS-PAGE under reducing conditions breaks disulfide bonds, so the analysis reveals the true polypeptide subunit masses. The appearance of bands at 80 kDa and 40 kDa shows that the fundamental subunits are 80 kDa and 40 kDa polypeptides. Let $n_{80}$ be the number of 80 kDa subunits per native complex and $n_{40}$ be the number of 40 kDa subunits per native complex. Mass conservation from SEC gives\n$$80\\,n_{80}+40\\,n_{40}=240.$$\nDensitometry indicates that the total mass in the 40 kDa band is twice the total mass in the 80 kDa band. Since band intensity is proportional to total protein mass in that band, this yields\n$$40\\,n_{40}=2\\cdot 80\\,n_{80},$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$n_{40}=4\\,n_{80}.$$\nSubstituting into the mass equation,\n$$80\\,n_{80}+40\\,(4\\,n_{80})=240 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 80\\,n_{80}+160\\,n_{80}=240 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 240\\,n_{80}=240 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; n_{80}=1,$$\nand therefore\n$$n_{40}=4.$$\n\nThus the native complex contains one 80 kDa subunit and four 40 kDa subunits, with a total mass $80\\times 1+40\\times 4=240$ kDa. Under non-reducing SDS-PAGE, the four 40 kDa subunits are consistent with forming a disulfide-linked 160 kDa species, while the 80 kDa subunit remains separate, giving the observed 160 kDa and 80 kDa bands. Under reducing conditions, disulfide bonds are cleaved, yielding the 80 kDa and 40 kDa bands with a two-to-one total mass ratio in agreement with the densitometry. Therefore, the correct composition is one 80 kDa subunit and four 40 kDa subunits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334519"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a protein's quaternary structure goes beyond simply counting its subunits; it's about appreciating how this assembly enables its biological function. Many proteins are not static entities but dynamic machines that require movement and conformational changes to work. [@problem_id:2334508] This problem explores the critical concept of conformational flexibility, challenging the intuitive notion that maximum stability is always optimal. It demonstrates how a protein's activity can be lost not from instability, but from becoming too rigid to perform the necessary motions for its catalytic cycle.", "problem": "A hypothetical allosteric enzyme, \"Regulase,\" functions as a homodimer, meaning it is composed of two identical protein subunits. The catalytic active sites are formed at the interface between these two subunits. For the enzyme to bind its substrate and release its product, the two subunits must be able to slightly shift and rotate relative to each other, transitioning between an \"open\" and a \"closed\" conformation. This dynamic movement is permitted by the non-covalent interactions that hold the dimer together.\n\nIn the wild-type enzyme, a key point of contact at the subunit interface involves a Leucine residue from each subunit, which are positioned opposite each other and contribute to a stable hydrophobic patch. A researcher introduces a point mutation that changes this Leucine residue to a Cysteine residue on both subunits. Under the oxidative conditions within the cell, the two new Cysteine residues at the interface form a covalent disulfide bond, linking the two subunits together at this position.\n\nAssuming the overall three-dimensional fold of each individual subunit is not significantly altered by this mutation, what is the most likely functional consequence for the Regulase enzyme?\n\nA. The enzymatic activity will significantly increase because the covalent disulfide bond greatly enhances the stability of the dimeric quaternary structure.\n\nB. The two subunits will fail to assemble into a dimer and the enzyme will be non-functional.\n\nC. The enzyme will lose its catalytic activity because the covalent bond restricts the conformational flexibility required for the catalytic cycle.\n\nD. The enzymatic activity will be unchanged because the mutation is not located directly within the substrate-binding portion of the active site.\n\nE. The enzyme will denature because the introduction of polar Cysteine residues disrupts the critical hydrophobic patch at the interface.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physical and biochemical principles: (i) homodimeric enzymes with active sites at the subunit interface often require relative subunit motions (rotation/translation) to achieve transitions between an open and a closed state during the catalytic cycle; (ii) non-covalent interactions at interfaces (e.g., hydrophobic contacts) allow tight association while still permitting conformational flexibility; (iii) introducing a covalent crosslink (a disulfide bond) across the interface constrains relative motion, decreases conformational entropy, and can block the conformational transitions required for catalysis.\n\nIn the wild-type enzyme, the interface contains opposing Leucine residues from each subunit, forming a hydrophobic patch that stabilizes the dimer through non-covalent hydrophobic interactions. Because these interactions are non-covalent and dynamic, the subunits retain the ability to undergo small shifts and rotations, enabling the necessary transitions between open and closed conformations to bind substrate and release product.\n\nLet the catalytic cycle be schematically represented by a conformationally gated sequence,\n$$E_{\\text{open}} + S \\rightleftharpoons ES_{\\text{closed}} \\to EP_{\\text{closed}} \\rightleftharpoons E_{\\text{open}} + P,$$\nwhere the transitions $E_{\\text{open}} \\leftrightarrows ES_{\\text{closed}}$ and $EP_{\\text{closed}} \\leftrightarrows E_{\\text{open}}$ require relative subunit motion at the dimer interface. In the wild-type, the hydrophobic interface permits these motions. The overall turnover rate $k_{\\text{cat}}$ can be limited by such conformational gating steps if their rate constants are small, so the catalytic activity depends critically on the ability to traverse these conformational states.\n\nUpon mutating the opposing Leucine residues to Cysteine and forming a disulfide bond under oxidative cellular conditions, a covalent crosslink is introduced directly across the interface at a key point of contact. A disulfide bond imposes a fixed covalent constraint on the relative positions of the linked residues, restricting the range of relative subunit rotations and translations that were previously allowed by non-covalent contacts. This restriction reduces the accessible conformational space and can prevent the enzyme from achieving either the open or the closed conformation required for substrate binding, product release, or catalysis. In kinetic terms, the corresponding conformational transition rate(s) effectively decrease, potentially to the point where the conformational step becomes blocked, leading to a significant decrease in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and loss of catalytic activity.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely: while the disulfide may increase structural stability of the dimer, catalysis depends on conformational flexibility; increased rigidity at the interface would typically reduce, not enhance, activity when motion is required.\n- B is unlikely: the disulfide bond would promote dimerization rather than prevent it; assembly failure is not expected.\n- C is most consistent: the covalent crosslink restricts essential conformational changes, leading to loss of catalytic activity.\n- D is incorrect: although the mutation is not within the substrate-binding pocket, it is at the interface that enables required motions; thus activity is affected through allosteric and conformational coupling.\n- E is unlikely: under oxidative conditions, the Cysteines form a disulfide, which is not strongly polar and is compatible with protein cores; the assumption states individual subunit folds are not significantly altered, arguing against denaturation as the predominant effect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely functional consequence is loss of catalytic activity due to restricted conformational flexibility imposed by the disulfide bond.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334508"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of quaternary structure allows scientists to move beyond analysis and into the realm of protein engineering.
