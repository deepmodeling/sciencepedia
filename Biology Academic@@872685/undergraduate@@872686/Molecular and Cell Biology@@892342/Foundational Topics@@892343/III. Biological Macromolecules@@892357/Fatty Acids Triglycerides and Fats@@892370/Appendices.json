For mixtures of triglycerides, $T_{m}$ increases with the fraction of saturated fatty acids, $f_{\\text{sat}}$, and with the average chain length, $\\langle X\\rangle$:\n$$T_{m}\\ \\text{increases with}\\ f_{\\text{sat}}\\ \\text{and with}\\ \\langle X\\rangle.$$\n\nApply these principles to the given fats. Olive oil has $f_{\\text{sat}} \\approx 0.14$, is predominantly monounsaturated (notably $C_{18:1}$), and therefore exhibits the lowest $T_{m}$ due to extensive unsaturation. Butter has $f_{\\text{sat}} \\approx 0.63$ and its most abundant saturated fatty acid is palmitic acid $C_{16:0}$, implying relatively long saturated chains that raise $T_{m}$. Coconut oil has $f_{\\text{sat}} \\approx 0.87$ but its most abundant saturated fatty acid is lauric acid $C_{12:0}$; although highly saturated (which increases $T_{m}$), the shorter average chain length lowers $T_{m}$ relative to fats dominated by longer saturated chains.\n\nBalancing these effects, olive oil has the lowest $T_{m}$ due to low $f_{\\text{sat}}$, butter has the highest $T_{m}$ due to substantial long-chain saturation, and coconut oil lies between them because its high saturation is tempered by shorter chain length.
