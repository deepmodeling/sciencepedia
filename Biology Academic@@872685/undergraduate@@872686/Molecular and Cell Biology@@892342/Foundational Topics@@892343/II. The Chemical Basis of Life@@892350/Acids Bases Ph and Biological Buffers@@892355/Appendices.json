The total concentration of the buffer is given as $C_{total} = [\\text{HA}] + [\\text{A}^-] = 0.100 \\text{ M}$. The initial pH is 4.76, which is equal to the pKa of acetic acid. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$ \\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right) $$\nGiven that pH = pKa, the equation becomes:\n$$ 4.76 = 4.76 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right) $$\nThis simplifies to $\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right) = 0$, which means the ratio $\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} = 10^0 = 1$. Therefore, the initial concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal: $[\\text{A}^-]_{initial} = [\\text{HA}]_{initial}$.\n\nUsing the total concentration, we can solve for the individual initial concentrations:\n$$ [\\text{A}^-]_{initial} + [\\text{HA}]_{initial} = 0.100 \\text{ M} $$\n$$ 2 \\times [\\text{A}^-]_{initial} = 0.100 \\text{ M} $$\n$$ [\\text{A}^-]_{initial} = [\\text{HA}]_{initial} = 0.0500 \\text{ M} $$\nThe initial number of moles in the 1.00 L solution are:\n$$ n_{A^-, initial} = 0.0500 \\text{ M} \\times 1.00 \\text{ L} = 0.0500 \\text{ mol} $$\n$$ n_{HA, initial} = 0.0500 \\text{ M} \\times 1.00 \\text{ L} = 0.0500 \\text{ mol} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of strong acid added. The problem states this amount is one-half of the total initial moles of all acetate species. The total initial moles of acetate species is:\n$$ n_{total, initial} = n_{A^-, initial} + n_{HA, initial} = 0.0500 \\text{ mol} + 0.0500 \\text{ mol} = 0.100 \\text{ mol} $$\nThe moles of strong acid ($n_{H^+}$) added is therefore:\n$$ n_{H^+} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times n_{total, initial} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.100 \\text{ mol} = 0.0500 \\text{ mol} $$\n\nNow, we determine the final composition of the solution after the reaction between the strong acid (H+) and the conjugate base (A-). The reaction is:\n$$ A^- + H^+ \\rightarrow HA $$\nThis reaction goes to completion. We can find the final moles of each species:\n$$ n_{A^-, final} = n_{A^-, initial} - n_{H^+} = 0.0500 \\text{ mol} - 0.0500 \\text{ mol} = 0 \\text{ mol} $$\n$$ n_{HA, final} = n_{HA, initial} + n_{H^+} = 0.0500 \\text{ mol} + 0.0500 \\text{ mol} = 0.100 \\text{ mol} $$\n\nSince the conjugate base A- has been completely consumed, the buffer is exhausted on the base side. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is no longer applicable. The pH of the final solution is determined by the dissociation of the weak acid, acetic acid (HA), which is now present at a concentration of $[\\text{HA}]_{final} = \\frac{0.100 \\text{ mol}}{1.00 \\text{ L}} = 0.100 \\text{ M}$.\n\nThe equilibrium for the dissociation of acetic acid is:\n$$ HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^- $$\nThe acid dissociation constant is $K_a = 10^{-pK_a} = 10^{-4.76}$. The equilibrium expression is:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]} $$\nLet $x$ be the equilibrium concentration of $[H^+]$ from the dissociation of HA.
