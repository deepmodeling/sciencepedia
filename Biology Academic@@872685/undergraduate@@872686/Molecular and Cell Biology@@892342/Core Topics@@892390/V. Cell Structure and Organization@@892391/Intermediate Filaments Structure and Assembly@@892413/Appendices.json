While all IFs share a common structure, they belong to different families with distinct assembly requirements. This practice [@problem_id:2320179] challenges you to apply these rules in a hypothetical in vitro experiment, predicting whether different types of IF proteins—keratins and vimentin—can co-assemble or if they will self-sort into separate structures.", "problem": "A research-focused cell biology lab is investigating the assembly rules of the cytoskeleton. A graduate student prepares a highly purified, equimolar mixture of three different Intermediate Filament (IF) monomers in a test tube: Keratin 8 (K8), Keratin 18 (K18), and Vimentin. The classification of these proteins is as follows:\n- Keratin 8 (K8) is a Type II (basic) keratin.\n- Keratin 18 (K18) is a Type I (acidic) keratin.\n- Vimentin is a Type III IF protein.\n\nThe student combines these three proteins in a buffer solution under physiological conditions that are known to promote the self-assembly of IFs from their monomeric subunits. After an incubation period sufficient for polymerization to reach equilibrium, the student plans to analyze the resulting structures.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the state of the mixture in the test tube after the incubation period?\n\nA. One uniform population of hybrid filaments will form, where K8, K18, and Vimentin monomers are randomly incorporated throughout the filament length.\n\nB. Two distinct populations of filaments will form: one population consisting of K8/K18 filaments and a separate population consisting of Vimentin filaments.\n\nC. Only K8/K18 filaments will form. The Vimentin monomers will remain unassembled because their polymerization is inhibited by the presence of keratin proteins.\n\nD. Only Vimentin filaments will form. The K8 and K18 monomers will remain unassembled because Type I and Type II keratins cannot polymerize in the presence of a Type III IF protein.\n\nE. No filaments of any kind will form. The mixture of monomers from different IF families creates steric hindrance that prevents the formation of the initial dimer and tetramer structures required for polymerization.", "solution": "Identify the protein classes and their assembly requirements:\n- Keratin 8 (K8) is a Type II keratin and Keratin 18 (K18) is a Type I keratin. By the well-established assembly rule for keratins, Type I and Type II keratins form obligate heterodimers; neither Type I nor Type II keratins form stable homodimer coiled coils under physiological assembly conditions. Therefore, in a mixture containing K8 and K18, the lowest-order assembly unit will be the K8/K18 heterodimer.\n- Vimentin is a Type III intermediate filament (IF) protein. Type III IFs (e.g., vimentin, desmin) can form homodimers and homopolymeric filaments and can heteropolymerize with certain other Type III family members, but they do not co-dimerize with keratins and do not co-assemble into mixed keratin/Type III filaments under standard conditions.\n\nApply the hierarchical IF assembly pathway to each family independently:\n- For keratins: K8/K18 heterodimers form; two heterodimers associate in an antiparallel, half-staggered manner to make tetramers; tetramers laterally associate to form unit-length filaments; longitudinal annealing and radial compaction yield mature keratin intermediate filaments. Because Type I/II pairing is required and because cross-family dimerization with vimentin does not occur, keratin subunits assemble only with each other (K8 with K18) and not with vimentin.\n- For vimentin: vimentin monomers form coiled-coil homodimers; homodimers associate into tetramers, then unit-length filaments, and mature vimentin filaments. This process proceeds autonomously in the same buffer conditions that promote keratin assembly. The presence of keratins does not inhibit vimentin polymerization under typical in vitro assembly conditions.\n\nEvaluate cross-family compatibility and mixing:\n- Cross-family co-assembly into hybrid filaments requires compatible coiled-coil dimer interfaces and head/tail domain interactions that permit stable tetramer formation across families. Empirically and mechanistically, keratin (Type I/II) and vimentin (Type III) do not form mixed heterodimers and do not co-assemble into hybrid filaments; instead, they assemble into separate networks when co-expressed in cells and into separate filament populations in vitro.\n- Therefore, random incorporation of K8, K18, and vimentin along the same filament is not supported. Likewise, there is no general inhibitory effect whereby one family blocks the polymerization of the other under physiological assembly conditions.\n\nMatch the reasoning to the options:\n- A is incorrect because keratins and vimentin do not co-assemble into a single hybrid filament population.\n- B is correct: K8 and K18 form keratin filaments together, and vimentin forms its own filaments, yielding two distinct filament populations.\n- C is incorrect because vimentin is not inhibited by keratins; it assembles independently.\n- D is incorrect because keratins (Type I with Type II) do polymerize in the presence of Type III; they simply do so separately.\n- E is incorrect because there is no steric hindrance preventing assembly; both families assemble along their respective, compatible pathways.\n\nConclusion: The mixture will contain two distinct filament populations: K8/K18 keratin filaments and vimentin filaments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2320179"}, {"introduction": "The structural integrity of our cells often depends on the precise architecture of their protein components. What happens when this architecture is flawed at the molecular level? This problem [@problem_id:2320186] presents a scenario inspired by genetic skin disorders, asking you to trace the cellular consequences of a single amino acid mutation that destabilizes the keratin coiled-coil dimer, a foundational unit of the epidermal cytoskeleton.", "problem": "In the basal layer of the epidermis, epithelial cells (keratinocytes) are filled with a dense network of intermediate filaments composed of keratin proteins. These filaments provide crucial mechanical integrity. The fundamental building block of a keratin filament is a coiled-coil dimer, formed when two different keratin polypeptides (one type I and one type II) wrap around each other. The stability of this dimer is highly dependent on specific interactions within the central alpha-helical rod domains of the polypeptides.\n\nA molecular biologist is investigating a genetic condition characterized by skin blistering upon mild physical trauma. They identify a point mutation in the gene encoding Keratin 5 (a type II keratin). This mutation results in the substitution of an alanine residue (a small, nonpolar amino acid) for a glutamate residue (an acidic, negatively charged amino acid) at a key position. In the wild-type protein, this glutamate residue is known to form a critical salt bridge with a positively charged arginine residue on the partner Keratin 14 (a type I keratin) polypeptide, locking the two chains together in the coiled-coil structure.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, which of the following describes the most direct and dominant cellular-level consequence?\n\nA. Immediate degradation of all Keratin 5 and Keratin 14 monomers by the cellular proofreading machinery before they can interact.\n\nB. Hyper-assembly of keratin proteins into large, non-functional aggregates that disrupt organelle trafficking.\n\nC. A failure to form stable keratin coiled-coil dimers, leading to a compromised intermediate filament network and increased cell fragility.\n\nD. Disruption of desmosome and hemidesmosome cell junctions, leading to a loss of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion.\n\nE. The mutated keratin filaments will be unable to bind to motor proteins, causing a complete halt in intracellular transport.", "solution": "1. Identify the molecular change: The mutation substitutes an alanine (small, nonpolar) for a glutamate (acidic, negatively charged) in Keratin 5 at a position that, in the wild type, forms a salt bridge with an arginine (positively charged) in Keratin 14 within the coiled-coil interface.\n2. Apply the principle of coiled-coil stabilization: Coiled-coil dimers are stabilized by heptad-repeat interactions combining hydrophobic packing (typically at a and d positions) and inter-chain electrostatic interactions (often at e and g positions). A glutamate-arginine pair provides a strong inter-chain salt bridge that lowers the free energy of dimer formation and reduces the dissociation rate.\n3. Infer the effect of the mutation on dimer stability: Replacing glutamate with alanine removes the negative charge and eliminates the salt bridge. This decreases favorable electrostatic interactions, disrupts optimal packing at the interface, and reduces the binding affinity between Keratin 5 and Keratin 14, thereby destabilizing the coiled-coil dimer.\n4. Connect dimer stability to filament assembly: Keratin intermediate filament assembly proceeds from coiled-coil dimers to antiparallel tetramers, unit-length filaments, and mature filaments. Failure to form stable dimers impairs all downstream assembly steps, leading to a weak or disorganized intermediate filament network.\n5. Infer the dominant cellular-level consequence: A compromised keratin intermediate filament network reduces mechanical resilience of basal keratinocytes, increasing susceptibility to mechanical stress and causing cell fragility consistent with skin blistering disorders.\n6. Evaluate alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect because there is no basis for immediate and complete degradation of all monomers before attempted interaction; while some misfolded protein may be degraded, the primary defect arises at the dimerization interface.\n- Option B is unlikely because loss of a key stabilizing salt bridge predicts reduced dimer stability and assembly, not hyper-assembly into aggregates.\n- Option D may occur secondarily when intermediate filaments fail to anchor to junctional complexes, but the most direct and dominant effect is the failure of filament assembly due to dimer destabilization.\n- Option E is incorrect because intermediate filaments are not principal tracks for motor-driven intracellular transport; lack of motor binding is not the mechanism here.\n7. Therefore, the most direct and dominant cellular consequence is failure to form stable keratin coiled-coil dimers, leading to a compromised intermediate filament network and increased cell fragility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2320186"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand molecular processes, scientists must be able to observe and measure them.

You will calculate the FRET efficiency to see how researchers can specifically monitor the final, critical step of IF assembly: the lateral compaction of protofilaments.", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is investigating the in vitro assembly of vimentin, a type of intermediate filament (IF). The assembly process involves the end-to-end polymerization of tetrameric subunits to form long protofilaments. Subsequently, these protofilaments associate laterally to form the final, stable 10-nm filament. To specifically monitor this lateral association step, the researchers design an experiment using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).\n\nThey prepare two separate populations of purified, assembly-competent vimentin tetramers. In Population A, the vimentin protein is fused to a donor fluorophore. In Population B, the protein is fused to an acceptor fluorophore at the identical structural position. The proteins are engineered such that after assembly into protofilaments, the fluorophores are located on the outer surface.\n\nThe two populations of protofilaments are then mixed in equal amounts and induced to assemble. The Förster radius ($R_0$) for the chosen donor-acceptor pair is 5.00 nm.
