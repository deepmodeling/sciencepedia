However, this \"treadmill\" can only turn if actin monomers are efficiently recycled and recharged for a new round of polymerization. This conceptual problem [@problem_id:2340775] challenges you to identify the critical bottleneck in this recycling pathway, focusing on the essential role of the actin-binding protein profilin. By considering the consequences of its removal, you will solidify your understanding of the molecular logistics that sustain cellular movement.", "problem": "The crawling motility of eukaryotic cells on a substrate is a fundamental biological process. This movement is primarily driven by the controlled polymerization of the protein actin at the cell's leading edge, forming a protrusive structure known as a lamellipodium. The assembly of actin filaments is regulated by a suite of actin-binding proteins. One such crucial protein is profilin. Profilin binds to actin monomers (G-actin) and facilitates the exchange of their bound Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), a step that 'charges' the monomer and makes it competent for polymerization. In an experiment, a population of motile human fibroblasts has its profilin gene knocked out, resulting in the complete absence of profilin protein.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary and most immediate consequence of profilin depletion on the motility of these cells?\n\nA. The rate of actin polymerization at the leading edge will decrease significantly, impairing the cell's ability to form lamellipodia and thus drastically reducing cell crawling.\n\nB. The cell's contractile machinery, responsible for pulling the rear of the cell forward, will become hyperactive, causing the cell to tear itself apart.\n\nC. The disassembly of old actin filaments at the rear of the lamellipodium will be blocked, leading to an accumulation of rigid, non-dynamic actin structures.\n\nD. The concentration of free, polymerization-ready G-actin will increase, leading to uncontrolled and explosive actin polymerization all over the cell cortex, resulting in a loss of directional movement.\n\nE. The cell will switch its mode of protrusion from broad lamellipodia to thin, finger-like projections called filopodia, but its overall speed of movement will remain unchanged.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must understand the step-by-step molecular mechanism of actin-based cell motility and the specific role profilin plays in this cycle.\n\nStep 1: The Actin Polymerization Cycle in Cell Motility\nCell crawling is initiated by the extension of the plasma membrane at the leading edge, a process driven by the polymerization of actin filaments. Monomeric actin (G-actin) adds to the growing, or \"barbed,\" ends of actin filaments (F-actin). This addition pushes the membrane forward, generating protrusive force. For this process to be sustained, there must be a constant supply of G-actin monomers that are in a state ready to be polymerized.\n\nStep 2: The Role of Cofilin and Actin Monomer Recycling\nAs the leading edge advances, older actin filaments further back in the lamellipodium need to be disassembled to recycle their G-actin subunits. The protein cofilin plays a key role here. It preferentially binds to and severs older filaments that contain ADP-bound actin. This disassembly releases a large number of ADP-G-actin monomers into the cytoplasm.\n\nStep 3: The Critical Function of Profilin\nThe ADP-G-actin monomers released by cofilin are not efficient at re-polymerizing onto the barbed ends of new filaments. The critical step is to exchange the bound ADP for ATP. This is where profilin's primary function lies. Profilin binds to ADP-G-actin and acts as a nucleotide exchange factor, catalyzing the release of ADP and the binding of ATP, which is much more abundant in the cytoplasm. The resulting profilin-ATP-G-actin complex is now \"charged\" and polymerization-competent. Profilin then shuttles this ATP-G-actin to the free barbed ends of growing filaments at the leading edge, promoting rapid and localized polymerization.\n\nStep 4: Consequence of Profilin Depletion\nIf profilin is depleted from the cell, the crucial step of nucleotide exchange on G-actin is severely inhibited. The spontaneous exchange of ADP for ATP on G-actin is a very slow process. Therefore, even though cofilin continues to disassemble old filaments and release G-actin monomers, these monomers will remain largely in their ADP-bound, non-polymerizable state. The pool of available ATP-G-actin, the essential fuel for protrusion, will plummet.\n\nStep 5: Evaluating the Options\nBased on this analysis, the direct result of profilin depletion is a bottleneck in the supply of polymerization-competent actin monomers.\n\n- Option A: \"The rate of actin polymerization at the leading edge will decrease significantly, impairing the cell's ability to form lamellipodia and thus drastically reducing cell crawling.\" This is the correct conclusion. Without a supply of ATP-G-actin, the machinery that drives protrusion at the leading edge stalls.\n\n- Option B: \"The cell's contractile machinery, responsible for pulling the rear of the cell forward, will become hyperactive, causing the cell to tear itself apart.\" This is incorrect. The contractile machinery primarily involves myosin-II. While the entire motility process is integrated, profilin's direct role is in polymerization at the front, not contractility at the rear.\n\n- Option C: \"The disassembly of old actin filaments at the rear of the lamellipodium will be blocked, leading to an accumulation of rigid, non-dynamic actin structures.\" This is incorrect. This describes the effect of depleting a protein like cofilin, which is responsible for filament disassembly. Profilin acts downstream of disassembly, on the recycled monomers.\n\n- Option D: \"The concentration of free, polymerization-ready G-actin will increase, leading to uncontrolled and explosive actin polymerization all over the cell cortex, resulting in a loss of directional movement.\" This is the opposite of what happens. The concentration of *polymerization-ready* (i.e., ATP-bound) G-actin will decrease dramatically. The total concentration of G-actin might rise, but it will be in the \"inert\" ADP-bound form.\n\n- Option E: \"The cell will switch its mode of protrusion from broad lamellipodia to thin, finger-like projections called filopodia, but its overall speed of movement will remain unchanged.\" This is incorrect. Both lamellipodia and filopodia formation depend on actin polymerization and thus require a supply of ATP-G-actin. Depleting profilin would impair the formation of both structures, not cause a switch between them while maintaining speed.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is the failure to generate new actin filaments at the leading edge, halting protrusion and motility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2340775"}, {"introduction": "Cells utilize the same actin building blocks to construct a diverse array of architectures, from the dynamic meshwork of a lamellipodium to the robust cables of a stress fiber. Master molecular switches, the Rho family of small GTPases, orchestrate this organization. This exercise [@problem_id:2340790] presents a classic scenario in cell biology—constitutive activation of the GTPase RhoA—and asks you to predict the resulting change in cell shape. Working through this problem will help you connect a specific molecular signal to a large-scale, functional outcome in cytoskeletal organization.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern cell shape and adhesion. They are working with a line of human fibroblast cells, which normally exhibit a spread-out, motile phenotype characterized by dynamic cell edges. To probe the function of the actin cytoskeleton, the researchers engineer these cells to overexpress a specific mutant protein: a version of the Guanine nucleotide Triphosphate-binding protein (GTPase) RhoA that has a glutamine-to-leucine substitution at position 63 (RhoA-Q63L). This mutation impairs the protein's intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis activity, effectively locking it in a permanently active, Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP)-bound state. The cells are then cultured under standard conditions for 24 hours to allow for protein expression.\n\nBased on the known signaling pathways involving RhoA, what is the most likely morphological outcome for the cells expressing the constitutively active RhoA-Q63L, when compared to a control population of untransfected fibroblasts?\n\nA. The cells will form an extensive network of thin, spike-like membrane protrusions known as filopodia, and their overall migratory speed will increase.\n\nB. The cells will flatten and extend broad, sheet-like membrane ruffles called lamellipodia at their leading edge, adopting a fan-like shape.\n\nC. The cells will contract, become more rounded, and develop thick, prominent bundles of cytoskeletal filaments known as stress fibers, which terminate in strong adhesion sites.\n\nD. The cells will lose all organized actin structures, leading to a complete collapse of the cytoskeleton and immediate cell lysis.\n\nE. The cells' morphology will be indistinguishable from the control cells, as the activity of other related GTPases will functionally compensate for the overactive RhoA.", "solution": "We begin from the molecular nature of the engineered protein. The RhoA-Q63L substitution impairs intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, so the protein is locked in the active, GTP-bound state. Therefore, the RhoA signaling pathway is constitutively engaged.\n\nActive RhoA-GTP binds and activates canonical downstream effectors, most prominently Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCK) and the formin mDia. ROCK increases actomyosin contractility by two coordinated mechanisms: it directly phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain and inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase, both of which raise steady-state phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain and thereby increase nonmuscle myosin II activity. Increased myosin II activity promotes tension within actin filament bundles. In parallel, mDia promotes linear actin polymerization and bundling. Together, these effects drive the formation of thick, contractile actin bundles spanning the cell, classically termed stress fibers.\n\nRhoA signaling also promotes the maturation and strengthening of focal adhesions, the large integrin-based adhesion complexes at the ends of stress fibers. Increased contractility and integrin clustering stabilize and enlarge focal adhesions, producing strong adhesion sites.\n\nAt the whole-cell level, sustained RhoA activity enhances contractility, often antagonizes Rac1-driven lamellipodial protrusion, and reduces edge dynamics, leading cells to become more rounded or contracted with prominent stress fibers terminating in robust focal adhesions. This phenotype contrasts with the thin, spike-like filopodia driven by Cdc42 and with the broad lamellipodia driven by Rac1.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, the constitutively active RhoA-Q63L most likely causes contraction, rounding, and formation of thick stress fibers with strong adhesion sites, matching option C. Options A and B correspond to Cdc42 and Rac1 activation, respectively; option D is not a consequence of RhoA activation; option E is incorrect because constitutive RhoA activity exerts a dominant effect that is not compensated by other GTPases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2340790"}, {"introduction": "We can describe cellular structures like lamellipodia as \"dynamic\" and stress fibers as \"stable,\" but how can we visualize and quantify this difference in living cells?

This practice encourages you to think like an experimentalist, connecting the theoretical concept of molecular turnover to tangible, observable data and reinforcing why different actin arrays have such distinct dynamic properties.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in a motile human fibroblast. The cells have been engineered to express actin fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), making the actin cytoskeleton fluorescent. The biologist performs a Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiment on two distinct actin-based structures within the same cell:\n1.  A stable, thick actin stress fiber located in the cell body.\n2.  The dynamic, branched actin network within the lamellipodium at the cell's leading edge.\n\nIn each experiment, a small, circular region within the target structure is irreversibly photobleached using a high-intensity laser, and the subsequent recovery of fluorescence in that region is monitored over time. Based on your understanding of actin dynamics in these two structures, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the FRAP experiments?\n\nA. The lamellipodium will show a faster and more complete fluorescence recovery compared to the stress fiber.\n\nB. The stress fiber will show a faster and more complete fluorescence recovery because it contains a higher density of actin filaments.\n\nC. Both structures will exhibit nearly identical fluorescence recovery rates and completeness, as both are composed of GFP-actin.\n\nD. Neither structure will show significant fluorescence recovery, as actin filaments are highly stable polymers and do not exchange subunits once assembled.\n\nE. The stress fiber will show complete but slow recovery, while the lamellipodium will show rapid but incomplete recovery due to the constant retrograde flow of the entire network.", "solution": "We model FRAP recovery in each structure by the standard first-order kinetics for the mobile fraction. Let $F(t)$ be the normalized fluorescence in the bleached region, with $F(0)$ the post-bleach value and $F_{\\infty}$ the asymptotic recovery. Under a single-exponential approximation, the recovery follows\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt}=\\frac{F_{\\infty}-F(t)}{\\tau} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad F(t)=F_{\\infty}\\left(1-\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)+F(0)\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right).\n$$\nThe key measurable parameters are the characteristic time $\\tau$ (or equivalently $t_{1/2}=\\tau\\ln 2$) and the mobile fraction $f_{m}$, where $F_{\\infty}=f_{m}$ when $F(0)$ is set to zero by normalization and the immobile fraction is $f_{i}=1-f_{m}$.\n\nFor the lamellipodium, the dynamic, branched actin network is characterized by rapid polymerization at barbed ends near the leading edge (large $k_{\\text{on}}c$) and rapid turnover due to severing and depolymerization (large effective $k_{\\text{off}}$), driven by Arp2/3-mediated branching, cofilin activity, and continual assembly-disassembly cycles. These dynamics yield a small $\\tau$ (fast recovery) and a large $f_{m}$ (near-complete recovery), since most GFP-actin subunits are exchanging on the experimental timescale. Retrograde flow translates the network but does not prevent subunit exchange from repopulating the bleached region; thus it does not impose an incomplete recovery in a stationary observation frame for subunit FRAP.\n\nFor the stress fiber, a stable, contractile actomyosin bundle stabilized by crosslinkers (for example, $\\alpha$-actinin) and tropomyosin exhibits reduced subunit exchange at filament sides and fewer accessible barbed ends for rapid turnover. Myosin II activity and extensive crosslinking reduce the effective on-off exchange within the bleached region, producing a larger $\\tau$ (slow recovery) and a significant immobile fraction $f_{i}>0$ (incomplete recovery), since a subset of actin remains stably incorporated over the FRAP timescale.\n\nTherefore, comparing the parameters, the lamellipodium has $\\tau_{\\text{lam}}\\tau_{\\text{SF}}$ and $f_{m,\\text{lam}}>f_{m,\\text{SF}}$, predicting faster and more complete fluorescence recovery in the lamellipodium than in the stress fiber. This matches statement A and contradicts B (stress fibers do not recover faster simply due to filament density), C (compositional GFP does not equalize dynamics), D (actin polymers do exchange subunits), and E (lamellipodial recovery is typically rapid and near-complete, while stress fibers often recover incompletely).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2340746"}]}
