This presents a paradox, as purified actin studied in vitro readily polymerizes into filaments (F-actin) at concentrations far lower than this. Cells resolve this by using sequestering proteins that bind to G-actin, creating a large, buffered pool of monomers unavailable for polymerization.\n\nConsider a specific region within a cell's cytoplasm where the total G-actin concentration is maintained at 100 μM. A large fraction of this G-actin is bound by a sequestering protein, let's call it Monomer-Binding Protein (MBP), which is present at a concentration of 99.7 μM.

This thought experiment probes the very engine of treadmilling by replacing ATP with a non-hydrolyzable analog, ATP$\\gamma$S. This scenario challenges you to predict how eliminating the energy-releasing step of hydrolysis fundamentally alters the properties of the filament ends and, consequently, the entire dynamic system [@problem_id:2323258].", "problem": "In an in vitro experiment studying the cytoskeleton, a solution contains purified globular actin (G-actin) monomers, salts, and a fixed amount of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The system is allowed to reach a steady state, where the total mass of filamentous actin (F-actin) is constant. At this steady state, the filaments exhibit treadmilling, a phenomenon characterized by net polymerization at one end and net depolymerization at the other, driven by a free G-actin monomer concentration that is above the critical concentration ($C_c$) for the plus (+) end but below the critical concentration for the minus (-) end.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical scenario where all the ATP in the system is instantly replaced by an equimolar amount of Adenosine 5'-[γ-thio]triphosphate (ATPγS), a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP.

The filaments will fragment into shorter pieces due to mechanical stress introduced by the ATPγS subunits.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of replacing ATP with its non-hydrolyzable analog, ATPγS, on actin filament dynamics at steady state.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the initial condition: a steady-state system exhibiting treadmilling.\n1.  **Actin Polymerization:** Actin polymerization is a dynamic process. G-actin monomers bound to ATP (ATP-actin) can add to either end of an F-actin filament.\n2.  **ATP Hydrolysis:** Shortly after a monomer is incorporated into the filament, its bound ATP is hydrolyzed to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$). The $P_i$ is then slowly released, leaving ADP-actin within the filament.\n3.  **Polarity and Critical Concentrations:** This process creates a structural and dynamic polarity. The plus (+) end tends to have a \"cap\" of ATP-actin or ADP-$P_i$-actin, as monomers are added there more rapidly. The minus (-) end is older and consists primarily of ADP-actin. ATP-actin has a higher affinity for the filament ends than ADP-actin. This results in different critical concentrations ($C_c$) for the two ends. The critical concentration is the free monomer concentration at which the rate of polymerization equals the rate of depolymerization.\n    *   The plus (+) end has a low critical concentration, $C_c^{(+)}$.\n    *   The minus (-) end has a high critical concentration, $C_c^{(-)}$.\n4.  **Treadmilling at Steady State:** At steady state, the concentration of free G-actin monomers, $C$, is maintained between these two values: $C_c^{(+)}  C  C_c^{(-)}$.\n    *   Since $C > C_c^{(+)}$, there is net polymerization (growth) at the plus (+) end.\n    *   Since $C  C_c^{(-)}$, there is net depolymerization (shrinkage) at the minus (-) end.\n    *   This simultaneous growth at one end and shrinkage at the other, with no net change in total polymer mass, is called treadmilling.\n\nNow, let's consider the introduction of ATPγS.\n1.  **Non-Hydrolyzable Analog:** ATPγS is a structural analog of ATP that can be bound by G-actin and incorporated into the filament, but it cannot be hydrolyzed into an ADP-like form.\n2.  **Consequence of No Hydrolysis:** This means that every subunit within the F-actin filament will remain in the ATPγS-bound state. The entire filament, including both the plus (+) and minus (-) ends, will be composed of subunits in the high-affinity state (analogous to the ATP-bound state).\n3.  **Effect on Critical Concentrations:** The high critical concentration of the minus end, $C_c^{(-)}$, is a direct consequence of it being composed primarily of low-affinity ADP-actin. By preventing the formation of this low-affinity state, ATPγS effectively transforms the minus end into a high-affinity end, similar to the plus end. Therefore, the critical concentration of the minus end will decrease dramatically to become nearly identical to the critical concentration of the plus end: $C_c^{(-)} \\approx C_c^{(+)}$. Let's call this new, single critical concentration $C_c^*$. This $C_c^*$ will be low, characteristic of the ATP-bound state.\n4.  **Disruption of Steady State:** The initial steady-state monomer concentration, $C$, was established such that $C_c^{(+)}  C  C_c^{(-)}$. After the introduction of ATPγS, we now have $C_c^* \\approx C_c^{(+)}  C$. The free monomer concentration $C$ is now significantly above the critical concentration for *both* ends of the filament.\n5.  **New Dynamics:** With the free monomer concentration above the critical concentration for both ends, the system is no longer at steady state. Net polymerization will occur simultaneously at both the plus (+) end and the minus (-) end. This will continue until the pool of free G-actin monomers is depleted and its concentration drops to the new steady-state value, $C = C_c^*$.\n6.  **Cessation of Treadmilling:** Once this new equilibrium is reached, where the monomer concentration equals the critical concentration for both ends, there will be no net polymerization or depolymerization at either end. The treadmilling phenomenon, which depends on the *difference* between the two ends, will have ceased. The filaments will be stable and longer than the original filaments.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n*   **A. Treadmilling will cease, and net polymerization will occur at both ends until a new, lower steady-state monomer concentration is reached.** This matches our conclusion perfectly. The minus end is stabilized, its $C_c$ drops, leading to net growth at both ends and an end to treadmilling.\n*   **B. The filaments will undergo rapid and complete depolymerization from both ends.** This is incorrect. ATPγS-actin is a high-affinity form, which stabilizes filaments, promoting polymerization, not depolymerization.\n*   **C. Treadmilling will be significantly accelerated due to the increased stability of the filament plus (+) end.** This is incorrect. While the plus end remains stable, the crucial change is the stabilization of the minus end. This *eliminates* the differential behavior required for treadmilling, rather than accelerating it.\n*   **D. The filament minus (-) ends will become functionally capped, leading to net filament growth only from the plus (+) ends.** This is incorrect. ATPγS does not act as a capping protein. It allows for polymerization. While the end becomes more stable, it will still grow as long as the monomer concentration is above its new low $C_c$. It does not become inert like a capped end.\n*   **E. The filaments will fragment into shorter pieces due to mechanical stress introduced by the ATPγS subunits.** This is incorrect. There is no known mechanism by which ATPγS would introduce mechanical stress leading to fragmentation. It is known to stabilize filaments.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that polymerization will occur at both ends, consuming free monomers until a new, lower steady-state concentration is achieved, at which point the dynamic process of treadmilling will stop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2323258"}, {"introduction": "Actin treadmilling is not just a fascinating molecular dance; it is a powerful engine that drives cellular movement.
