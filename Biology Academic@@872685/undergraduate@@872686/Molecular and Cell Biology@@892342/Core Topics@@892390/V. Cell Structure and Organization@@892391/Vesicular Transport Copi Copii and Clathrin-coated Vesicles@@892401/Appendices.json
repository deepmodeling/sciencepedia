The enzyme is synthesized and correctly folded within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). To function, it must be transported from ER exit sites to the Golgi apparatus. Upon sequencing the protein, the biologists determine that the short polypeptide segment extending into the cytoplasm contains a specific three-amino-acid sequence: Asp-Ala-Glu.\n\nBased on this molecular information, which of the following coat protein complexes is primarily responsible for recognizing this signal and packaging GlycoMod-alpha into vesicles for its transport from the ER to the Golgi?\n\nA.

Such DXE motifs on the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo proteins are specifically recognized by the COPII coat, particularly by the Sec24 cargo-binding subunit, facilitating their capture into COPII vesicles.\n- Exclude alternatives:\n  - COPI primarily mediates retrograde transport (Golgi to ER) and recognizes retrieval signals such as KKXX on membrane proteins or KDEL via the KDEL receptor; it is not the primary coat for ER export to the Golgi.\n  - Clathrin mediates transport from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes/lysosomes and in endocytosis from the plasma membrane, not ER-to-Golgi transport.\n  - Caveolin functions in caveolae-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane, not in ER-to-Golgi trafficking.\n- Conclusion: The DXE motif (Asp-Ala-Glu) signals ER export via COPII.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2347376"}, {"introduction": "After a vesicle successfully buds from its origin, it must precisely identify and merge with its target membrane to deliver its contents. This critical delivery process is not a single event but a carefully orchestrated two-step sequence: initial long-range capture, known as tethering, followed by short-range membrane merger, or fusion. This hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:2347339] challenges you to distinguish between these two events by predicting the fate of a vesicle when the fusion machinery is selectively disabled, thereby clarifying the distinct roles of Rab GTPases and SNARE proteins.", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is investigating the secretory pathway in a cultured mammalian cell line. They introduce a novel bacterial toxin that has a highly specific proteolytic activity: it selectively cleaves and inactivates all target-Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptor (t-SNARE) proteins located on the cytoplasmic face of the cis-Golgi network membrane. All other cellular components, including the machinery for vesicle formation, Rab Guanosine Triphosphatases (GTPases) and their corresponding effector proteins, and vesicle-SNAREs (v-SNAREs) on transport vesicles, remain fully functional.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, what is the most probable immediate outcome for a Coat Protein Complex II (COPII)-coated vesicle that has just budded from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and is destined for the Golgi apparatus?\n\nA. The vesicle will fail to be targeted to the Golgi apparatus and will instead drift aimlessly in the cytoplasm until it is degraded.\nB. The vesicle will successfully uncoat and fuse with the cis-Golgi membrane, but its cargo will be immediately and incorrectly packaged into COPI vesicles for retrograde transport back to the ER.\nC. The vesicle will be captured and physically tethered to the cis-Golgi membrane but will be unable to undergo membrane fusion, leading to an accumulation of unfused vesicles at the target site.\nD. The vesicle will be unable to shed its COPII coat, which physically prevents any interaction with the cis-Golgi membrane.\nE. The vesicle will bypass the defective cis-Golgi and fuse with the next available compartment, the medial-Golgi.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fate of a COPII vesicle in a cell where the t-SNAREs on the cis-Golgi are non-functional. To solve this, we must dissect the sequential steps of vesicular transport from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to the Golgi.\n\n1.  **Vesicle Budding and Transport:** COPII vesicles are responsible for anterograde transport, moving cargo from the ER to the cis-Golgi network. The problem states that the machinery for vesicle formation is intact, so COPII vesicles will form correctly at the ER exit sites, enclosing their cargo, and travel towards the Golgi.\n\n2.  **Tethering:** The first step in vesicle-target recognition is tethering. This process involves the specific recognition between a Rab-GTPase protein on the surface of the transport vesicle and a corresponding tethering protein complex (a Rab effector) on the target membrane. The problem explicitly states that Rab GTPases and their effectors are fully functional. Therefore, the COPII vesicle, which carries the appropriate Rab protein for the cis-Golgi, will be successfully recognized and captured by the cis-Golgi membrane. This initial, often long-range, \"capture\" is what constitutes tethering. This immediately rules out option A, as the vesicle will be successfully targeted. It also rules out option E, as targeting is specific; the vesicle is programmed to interact with the cis-Golgi, not other compartments.\n\n3.  **Docking and Fusion:** Following tethering, the vesicle must dock and fuse with the target membrane to deliver its contents. This is a short-range interaction mediated by the pairing of v-SNAREs on the vesicle membrane with t-SNAREs on the target membrane. The formation of a stable, four-helix bundle called the trans-SNARE complex pulls the two lipid bilayers into close proximity, overcoming the energy barrier for membrane fusion.\n\n4.  **Applying the Experimental Condition:** The core of the problem lies here. The bacterial toxin has specifically cleaved and inactivated the t-SNAREs on the cis-Golgi. Even though the vesicle has been successfully tethered (Step 2) and has functional v-SNAREs on its surface, there are no functional t-SNARE partners on the target membrane. Consequently, the trans-SNARE complex cannot form. Without the formation of this complex, the final steps of docking and membrane fusion are blocked.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Outcomes:**\n    *   **Option A:** Incorrect. Tethering via Rab proteins is functional, so the vesicle is correctly targeted.\n    *   **Option B:** Incorrect. The primary defect prevents membrane fusion. If fusion cannot occur, cargo cannot be delivered to the Golgi lumen to be subsequently sorted.\n    *   **Option C:** Correct. This option accurately describes the situation. Tethering occurs (the vesicle is \"captured\"), but the subsequent step of fusion is blocked due to the inactive t-SNAREs. This would lead to a microscopic observation of vesicles accumulating at, and physically associated with, the cis-Golgi membrane, but without having merged with it.\n    *   **Option D:** Incorrect. The shedding of the COPII coat (uncoating) is a process that typically occurs just before or concurrently with tethering. It is regulated by factors like the hydrolysis of GTP by Sar1 (a small GTPase involved in COPII coat assembly) and is not dependent on the status of SNARE proteins. The vesicle would uncoat, but still be unable to fuse.\n    *   **Option E:** Incorrect. Vesicle targeting is highly specific. The Rab-effector interaction directs the vesicle to the cis-Golgi. There is no mechanism for it to \"decide\" to bypass its target and move to the medial-Golgi.\n\nTherefore, the vesicle completes the tethering step but is arrested just before fusion, leading to its accumulation at the cis-Golgi.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2347339"}, {"introduction": "Moving from established mechanisms to the process of scientific discovery, this final practice explores how researchers investigate the molecular dynamics of vesicle formation. Cellular processes like coat assembly are not just simple one-to-one interactions but are often influenced by collective behaviors like protein clustering. This problem [@problem_id:2347329] introduces an experimental design using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to test a hypothesis about cargo concentration, challenging you to think like a cell biologist and connect a complex cellular question to a powerful laboratory technique.", "problem": "A cell biology research team is investigating the initial steps of protein export from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) via COPII-coated vesicles. They hypothesize that the oligomerization of cargo proteins within the ER lumen serves as a key mechanism to concentrate these proteins into patches, thereby actively promoting the recruitment of the Sec23/24 subcomplex of the COPII coat on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, they design an *in vitro* reconstitution experiment using purified components and ER-derived membrane vesicles. The system includes:\n1.  A transmembrane cargo protein engineered with a cytoplasmic tail containing a known COPII sorting signal. The lumenal domain of this cargo protein is fused to a chemically inducible dimerization domain.\n2.  A non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, called GTP$\\gamma$S, to lock the small GTPase Sar1 in its active, membrane-bound state.\n3.  All necessary purified COPII coat proteins (Sar1, Sec23/24, Sec13/31).\n4.  A chemical dimerizing agent that, when added, specifically causes the lumenal domains of the cargo proteins to oligomerize.\n\nTo monitor the recruitment of Sec23/24 to the cargo, they employ Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a technique that detects molecular proximity (typically less than 10 nm). They create two fusion proteins:\n-   **Cargo-CFP**: The cargo protein is fused to Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), the FRET donor, on its cytoplasmic C-terminus.\n-   **Sec23-YFP**: The Sec23 protein is fused to Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), the FRET acceptor.\n\nThe experiment is conducted by mixing the ER membranes, Cargo-CFP, Sar1, GTP$\\gamma$S, and Sec23-YFP/Sec24. The FRET efficiency between CFP and YFP is measured before and after the addition of the chemical dimerizing agent.\n\nAssuming the hypothesis is correct, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome of the FRET experiment?\n\nA. A high FRET signal will be observed both before and after the addition of the dimerizing agent, as Sar1-GTP$\\gamma$S is sufficient to recruit Sec23/24.\nB. A low FRET signal will be observed initially, which will increase significantly upon addition of the dimerizing agent.\nC. A high FRET signal will be observed initially, which will decrease significantly upon addition of the dimerizing agent.\nD. A low FRET signal will be observed both before and after the addition of the dimerizing agent, because the Sec13/31 complex is required for stable Sec23/24 recruitment.\nE. No FRET signal will be observed under any condition because the donor (CFP) and acceptor (YFP) are separated by the ER membrane.", "solution": "The goal is to predict the FRET outcome based on the mechanism of COPII coat recruitment and the spatial proximity required for FRET.\n\nFirst, FRET detection requires that the donor and acceptor fluorophores be within a distance $R<10 \\text{ nm}$. In this system, the fluorophores are positioned on the cytosolic face: Cargo-CFP is fused to the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the transmembrane cargo, and Sec23-YFP is part of the cytosolic Sec23/24 complex. Therefore, there is no membrane-imposed separation between CFP and YFP, and FRET is physically feasible when Sec23/24 binds near cargo tails.\n\nSecond, consider COPII recruitment. Sar1 bound to GTP$\\gamma$S adopts the active, membrane-bound state and recruits the Sec23/24 complex to membranes. Sec23/24 recognizes COPII sorting signals on cargo cytosolic tails, forming a prebudding complex. This interaction can occur without Sec13/31; thus, stable association of Sec23/24 with cargo does not strictly require Sec13/31 for initial recruitment. However, the extent and stability of recruitment depend on the local density and avidity of cargo–coat interactions.\n\nThird, evaluate the effect of lumenal oligomerization. The dimerizing agent induces oligomerization of the lumenal domains of the cargo, which clusters the transmembrane cargo proteins into membrane patches. Clustering increases the local density of cytosolic sorting signals and enhances multivalent avidity for Sec23/24. This should increase the probability and dwell time of Sec23/24 binding near cargo tails, thereby decreasing the average distance between Cargo-CFP and Sec23-YFP and increasing the fraction of pairs with $R<10 \\text{ nm}$.\n\nFourth, predict the FRET behavior. Before addition of the dimerizer, with dispersed cargo, Sec23/24 recruitment to specific cargo is expected to be limited in extent and dwell time, yielding a relatively low FRET signal. After addition of the dimerizer, clustering strengthens and concentrates Sec23/24 recruitment at cargo patches, increasing the proximity of Sec23-YFP to Cargo-CFP and thus increasing FRET efficiency.\n\nFinally, evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because although Sar1-GTP$\\gamma$S can recruit Sec23/24 to membranes, high FRET specifically requires close proximity to cargo tails; dispersed cargo reduces specific proximity.\n- B is correct because oligomerization should convert a low initial FRET signal into a higher one by enhancing Sec23/24 recruitment to clustered cargo.\n- C is incorrect; oligomerization should not decrease recruitment or FRET under the stated hypothesis.\n- D is incorrect; Sec23/24 can be recruited in a prebudding complex without Sec13/31.\n- E is incorrect; both fluorophores are cytosolic, so the ER membrane does not prevent FRET.\n\nThus, the expected outcome is a low initial FRET signal that increases significantly upon addition of the dimerizing agent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2347329"}]}
