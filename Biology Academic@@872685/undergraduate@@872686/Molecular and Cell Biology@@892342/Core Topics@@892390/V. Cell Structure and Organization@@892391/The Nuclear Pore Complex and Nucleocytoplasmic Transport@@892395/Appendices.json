This thought experiment [@problem_id:2343485] challenges you to predict the fate of a specially engineered protein, combining components from different domains of life. It highlights the fundamental principle that the Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) is a dominant and highly conserved \"zip code\" that the cell's transport machinery can read, regardless of the protein to which it is attached.", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists constructs a new gene encoding a fusion protein. This protein consists of two parts: the full-length enzyme $\\beta$-galactosidase, which is native to the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, and a short peptide sequence known as the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) large T-antigen Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), which is a well-characterized signal that targets proteins to the nucleus in human cells. The gene for this fusion protein is then successfully introduced into and expressed by the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.\n\nAssuming the fusion protein folds correctly and the NLS is fully exposed and functional, in which of the following cellular compartments will the majority of these fusion protein molecules be located at steady-state?\n\nA. The cytoplasm\n\nB. The nucleus\n\nC. The mitochondria\n\nD. Secreted out of the cell\n\nE. Evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus", "solution": "The problem asks for the final location of a specially designed fusion protein expressed in a yeast cell. To determine this, we must analyze the signals present on the protein and understand the protein sorting mechanisms within a eukaryotic cell like yeast.\n\nThe fusion protein is composed of two distinct parts:\n1.  **$\\beta$-galactosidase from *E. coli***: This is a bacterial protein. Proteins native to prokaryotes like *E. coli* do not possess the intrinsic sorting signals required for trafficking to specific organelles within a eukaryotic cell. Therefore, if expressed alone in yeast, $\\beta$-galactosidase would remain in the cytosol, the site of its synthesis on free ribosomes.\n2.  **SV40 large T-antigen Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS)**: This is a specific amino acid sequence, Pro-Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val, that acts as a \"zip code\" or targeting signal. In its native context (human cells infected with SV40 virus), this signal directs the T-antigen protein into the nucleus.\n\nThe central principle governing protein fate is that sorting signals on a protein are recognized by cellular machinery that directs the protein to its correct destination. In this case, the dominant signal is the NLS. The process of nuclear import involves the following key steps:\n- A cytosolic receptor protein, called an importin, recognizes and binds to the NLS on the cargo protein (our fusion protein).\n- The importin-cargo complex is then guided to the nuclear envelope, where it interacts with the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), the channel that regulates passage into and out of the nucleus.\n- The complex is actively transported through the NPC into the nucleoplasm, a process that requires energy in the form of GTP hydrolysis, mediated by the Ran protein cycle.\n\nA crucial aspect of this problem is the cross-species functionality of the NLS. The fundamental cellular processes, including the machinery for nuclear import (importins, NPCs, the Ran cycle), are highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. This means that the components of the nuclear import pathway in yeast are structurally and functionally very similar to those in humans.\n\nConsequently, the yeast cell's importin proteins will recognize the human-derived SV40 NLS attached to the bacterial $\\beta$-galactosidase. The yeast machinery will treat the entire fusion protein as a cargo destined for the nucleus. The bacterial enzyme part is passively carried along.\n\nTherefore, despite being synthesized in the cytoplasm, the fusion protein will be actively and continuously transported into the nucleus. This leads to its accumulation within the nucleus at steady state.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- A. **The cytoplasm**: Incorrect. While the protein is synthesized here, the NLS will cause its active transport out of the cytoplasm and into the nucleus.\n- C. **The mitochondria**: Incorrect. Transport into mitochondria requires a specific mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is a different type of signal peptide not present on this fusion protein.\n- D. **Secreted out of the cell**: Incorrect. Secretion requires an N-terminal signal peptide that directs the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum, the first step of the secretory pathway. This signal is absent.\n- E. **Evenly distributed**: Incorrect. Nuclear import is an active transport process that concentrates proteins against a concentration gradient, not a passive diffusion process. This will lead to a much higher concentration in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm.\n\nBased on the conserved nature of the nuclear import machinery, the fusion protein will be actively imported and will accumulate in the nucleus of the yeast cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2343485"}, {"introduction": "While some proteins are destined to remain in the nucleus, many shuttle back and forth, requiring an opposing signal for export. This problem [@problem_id:2343463] puts you in the role of a researcher designing an experiment to test for a functional Nuclear Export Signal (NES). By predicting the results of an experiment using a fluorescent reporter protein and a specific inhibitor, you will learn the logic behind how scientists identify and validate the components of the nucleocytoplasmic transport system.", "problem": "A molecular biology research team is investigating a newly discovered human protein called \"Synaptic Trafficking Modulator\" (STM). Based on its amino acid sequence, they hypothesize that a specific segment within STM functions as a Nuclear Export Signal (NES), a short peptide sequence that targets a protein for export from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, they design an experiment using a fusion protein.\n\nThey create a DNA construct that encodes for a test protein with the following components fused together in order:\n1.  A well-characterized, strong Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), which actively targets proteins for import into the nucleus.\n2.  The Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which allows for visualization of the protein's location within a living cell.\n3.  The candidate 15-amino-acid segment from the STM protein, which is the putative NES.\n\nThis entire fusion protein is referred to as NLS-GFP-STM_NES.\n\nThe researchers transfect a culture of human cells with this DNA construct. They then observe the subcellular localization of the NLS-GFP-STM_NES protein using fluorescence microscopy under two conditions: a control group of untreated cells, and a group of cells treated with Leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1, which is responsible for recognizing and exporting most leucine-rich NES-containing proteins.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence that the candidate sequence from STM is a functional, CRM1-dependent Nuclear Export Signal?\n\nA. In untreated cells, NLS-GFP-STM_NES is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. Upon treatment with LMB, its localization remains predominantly in the cytoplasm.\n\nB. In untreated cells, NLS-GFP-STM_NES is found predominantly in the nucleus. Upon treatment with LMB, the protein redistributes to be predominantly in the cytoplasm.\n\nC. In untreated cells, NLS-GFP-STM_NES is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. Upon treatment with LMB, the protein accumulates and is now found predominantly in the nucleus.\n\nD. In untreated cells, NLS-GFP-STM_NES is found exclusively in the nucleus. Upon treatment with LMB, its localization does not change.\n\nE. In untreated cells, NLS-GFP-STM_NES is found equally distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Upon treatment with LMB, it is found exclusively at the nuclear envelope.", "solution": "Fundamental principles:\n- An NLS directs active import of a protein into the nucleus via the importin pathway; a strong, well-characterized NLS typically yields predominant nuclear accumulation at steady state in the absence of opposing signals.\n- A leucine-rich NES mediates active nuclear export via the CRM1 export receptor.\n- Leptomycin B (LMB) specifically inhibits CRM1-dependent export by covalently modifying CRM1, thereby blocking NES-CRM1 interactions.\n- The steady-state localization of a shuttling protein bearing both an NLS and an NES reflects the balance between import and export. If export via CRM1 is active, localization can shift toward the cytoplasm; if export is inhibited, the NLS-driven import dominates, causing nuclear accumulation.\n\nPredicted outcomes for the NLS-GFP-STM_NES reporter:\n- If the STM segment functions as a CRM1-dependent NES, then in untreated cells the fusion protein will be efficiently exported, leading to predominant cytoplasmic localization despite the strong NLS.\n- Upon LMB treatment (CRM1 inhibition), export is blocked; the strong NLS will then dominate, driving accumulation in the nucleus.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Cytoplasmic in untreated cells but no change with LMB suggests the cytoplasmic localization is independent of CRM1 (e.g., cytoplasmic retention or a non-CRM1 export). This does not support a CRM1-dependent NES.\n- B: Nuclear in untreated cells and cytoplasmic with LMB is the opposite of the expected effect of inhibiting export; LMB cannot promote export, so this contradicts CRM1-dependent NES function.\n- C: Cytoplasmic in untreated cells and nuclear accumulation with LMB matches the expectation for a functional, CRM1-dependent NES opposing a strong NLS.\n- D: Exclusively nuclear in both conditions suggests no functional NES is present; the strong NLS dominates with no evidence of CRM1-dependent export.\n- E: Equal nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution shifting to nuclear envelope upon LMB is not a typical signature of CRM1 inhibition and does not specifically indicate CRM1-dependent NES function.\n\nTherefore, the strongest evidence for a functional, CRM1-dependent NES in the STM segment is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2343463"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the signals on cargo proteins, we now turn our attention to the engine that drives the entire transport process: the Ran cycle. This scenario [@problem_id:2343504] explores the consequences of disrupting a critical component of the transport machinery itself. By analyzing a hypothetical temperature-sensitive mutation in Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2), you must deduce the system-wide impact on the crucial Ran protein gradient, deepening your understanding of the cycle's delicate balance and interconnectedness.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating nucleocytoplasmic transport using a specially engineered mammalian cell line. This cell line possesses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2). At a permissive temperature of 32°C, the NTF2 protein functions normally. However, when the cells are shifted to a non-permissive temperature of 39°C, the mutant NTF2 protein rapidly denatures and becomes completely non-functional.\n\nFor this system, you are given the following established facts about the Ran cycle, which governs the transport of many molecules across the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC):\n1.  Ran is a small protein that acts as a molecular switch, existing in two forms: Ran-GDP (bound to Guanosine diphosphate) and Ran-GTP (bound to Guanosine triphosphate).\n2.  A steep concentration gradient is maintained across the nuclear envelope, with a high concentration of Ran-GTP inside the nucleus and a high concentration of Ran-GDP in the cytoplasm.\n3.  This gradient is maintained by two spatially segregated enzymes:\n    - **RCC1 (Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1)** is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor exclusively located in the nucleus, where it catalyzes the conversion of Ran-GDP to Ran-GTP.\n    - **RanGAP1 (Ran GTPase Activating Protein 1)** is exclusively located in the cytoplasm, where it promotes the hydrolysis of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP.\n4.  The primary mechanism for importing Ran into the nucleus is via the transport receptor NTF2, which specifically binds to Ran-GDP in the cytoplasm and facilitates its transport through the NPC. The export of Ran from the nucleus is an independent process, typically occurring when Ran-GTP binds to an exportin receptor.\n\nThe biologist cultures the cells at the permissive temperature of 32°C, allowing them to reach a stable state. The entire culture is then shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 39°C and maintained for several hours, sufficient time to establish a new steady state.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the change in the total concentration of Ran protein (i.e., the sum of Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP concentrations) inside the nucleus at the new steady state (39°C) compared to the initial steady state (32°C)?\n\nA. The total nuclear Ran concentration will increase significantly.\n\nB. The total nuclear Ran concentration will decrease significantly.\n\nC. The total nuclear Ran concentration will remain essentially unchanged.\n\nD. The total nuclear Ran concentration will oscillate, but its time-averaged value will be unchanged.\n\nE. The concentration of nuclear Ran-GTP will decrease, but the concentration of nuclear Ran-GDP will increase by a corresponding amount, leaving the total nuclear Ran concentration unchanged.", "solution": "Let $G_{n}$ and $D_{n}$ denote the nuclear concentrations of Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP, respectively, and let $R_{n} = G_{n} + D_{n}$ be the total nuclear Ran. Let $D_{c}$ and $G_{c}$ denote the cytoplasmic Ran-GDP and Ran-GTP, respectively. The key spatially segregated conversions are:\n- In the nucleus, RCC1 catalyzes $D_{n} \\to G_{n}$ with rate $v_{1} = k_{1} D_{n}$.\n- In the cytoplasm, RanGAP1 catalyzes $G_{c} \\to D_{c}$ with rate $v_{2} = k_{2} G_{c}$.\n\nTransport fluxes across the NPC are:\n- NTF2-mediated import of Ran-GDP: $J_{\\text{in}} = k_{\\text{NTF2}} D_{c}$.\n- Exportin-mediated export of Ran-GTP: $J_{\\text{out}} = k_{\\text{exp}} G_{n}$.\nAny passive leakage, if present, is a nonnegative function of nuclear Ran (denote the total leakage out by $J_{\\text{leak}} \\ge 0$), and is not required to be invoked explicitly because the problem states NTF2 is the primary import mechanism and export is via Ran-GTP with exportin.\n\nThe nuclear mass balance for total Ran is\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{n}}{dt} \\;=\\; \\frac{d(G_{n}+D_{n})}{dt} \\;=\\; J_{\\text{in}} \\;-\\; J_{\\text{out}} \\;-\\; J_{\\text{leak}}.\n$$\nNote that intra-nuclear conversion by RCC1 ($D_{n} \\leftrightarrow G_{n}$) cancels in the sum and thus does not change $R_{n}$.\n\nAt the permissive temperature, $k_{\\text{NTF2}} > 0$, and at steady state,\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; J_{\\text{in}}^{0} \\;-\\; J_{\\text{out}}^{0} \\;-\\; J_{\\text{leak}}^{0},\n$$\nwhich determines some finite $R_{n}^{0} = G_{n}^{0} + D_{n}^{0}$ with $J_{\\text{in}}^{0} = J_{\\text{out}}^{0} + J_{\\text{leak}}^{0}$.\n\nAfter shift to the non-permissive temperature, the mutant NTF2 is completely non-functional, so\n$$\nk_{\\text{NTF2}} \\to 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad J_{\\text{in}} \\to 0.\n$$\nAt the new steady state,\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; J_{\\text{in}} \\;-\\; J_{\\text{out}} \\;-\\; J_{\\text{leak}} \\;=\\; -\\,J_{\\text{out}} \\;-\\; J_{\\text{leak}}.\n$$\nBecause $J_{\\text{out}} = k_{\\text{exp}} G_{n} \\ge 0$ and $J_{\\text{leak}} \\ge 0$, the only way to satisfy $-J_{\\text{out}} - J_{\\text{leak}} = 0$ is\n$$\nJ_{\\text{out}} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad J_{\\text{leak}} = 0,\n$$\nwhich requires $G_{n}$ to be driven to a minimal level consistent with vanishing export and, correspondingly, $R_{n}$ to drop to a much lower level than $R_{n}^{0}$ (since with no import, any initial nuclear Ran is depleted by export until export ceases due to scarcity of nuclear Ran-GTP). RCC1 cannot restore $R_{n}$ because it only interconverts $D_{n}$ and $G_{n}$ without changing their sum. Therefore, the new steady state necessarily has a substantially reduced $R_{n}$.\n\nThis rules out options A, C, D, and E. In particular, E is inconsistent because nuclear Ran-GDP does not increase in the absence of nuclear RanGAP1; rather, RCC1 favors $D_{n} \\to G_{n}$, and with no import, both $D_{n}$ and $G_{n}$ decrease as export removes Ran from the nucleus until export halts.\n\nHence, the total nuclear Ran concentration decreases significantly at 39°C relative to 32°C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2343504"}]}
