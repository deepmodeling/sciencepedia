This exercise challenges you to act as a cellular detective, using a static microscopic image to deduce the nature of a dynamic molecular defect. By connecting the observed phenotype of mitochondrial fragmentation to the underlying processes, you will practice a fundamental skill in cell biology: interpreting structure to understand function [@problem_id:2323903].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a newly discovered inherited metabolic disease. They culture fibroblast cells from a patient and from a healthy, unrelated individual to serve as a control. Using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy to visualize the mitochondria, they observe a stark difference. The healthy control cells exhibit a dynamic mitochondrial network, with a mixture of individual small organelles and long, interconnected tubular structures. In contrast, the patient's cells exclusively contain a population of small, spherical, and highly fragmented mitochondria. The biologist hypothesizes that the disease is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in a single class of proteins that disrupts the normal equilibrium of mitochondrial morphology.\n\nBased on this observation, which of the following protein classes is most likely to be non-functional in the patient's cells?\n\nA. Proteins that mediate mitochondrial fusion\n\nB. Proteins that mediate mitochondrial fission\n\nC. Proteins of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome)\n\nD. Proteins that constitute the ATP synthase complex\n\nE. Proteins involved in importing nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondrial matrix", "solution": "Step 1: State the governing principle. Mitochondrial morphology in cells reflects a dynamic equilibrium between two opposing processes: fusion and fission. Proteins mediating fusion (e.g., mitofusins on the outer membrane and OPA1 on the inner membrane) promote the formation of elongated, interconnected mitochondrial tubules. Proteins mediating fission (e.g., DRP1 with its adaptors) promote division of mitochondria into smaller units.\n\nStep 2: Predict morphological outcomes of loss-of-function in each class.\n- If fusion proteins are non-functional, ongoing fission events are unopposed, preventing mitochondria from rejoining into tubules. The expected morphology is a population of small, spherical, fragmented mitochondria.\n- If fission proteins are non-functional, fusion becomes relatively unopposed, leading to elongated, hyperfused, interconnected mitochondrial networks.\n\nStep 3: Match observation to prediction. The patient’s cells exhibit exclusively small, spherical, highly fragmented mitochondria. This pattern matches the phenotype expected when fusion is impaired, not when fission is impaired. The healthy control shows the normal mixed network indicative of intact fusion–fission balance.\n\nStep 4: Exclude alternatives. Defects in mitoribosomal proteins, ATP synthase subunits, or protein import machinery primarily cause bioenergetic and proteostatic dysfunctions. While such defects may secondarily affect morphology, they do not specifically and predictably produce the exclusive fragmentation pattern described. The most direct and specific cause of the observed morphology is loss of mitochondrial fusion activity.\n\nConclusion: The most likely non-functional class is proteins that mediate mitochondrial fusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2323903"}, {"introduction": "While static images reveal the steady-state outcome of fission and fusion, they do not capture the processes in action. To truly verify that mitochondria exchange contents, scientists must visualize these dynamics in living cells. This problem introduces a powerful fluorescence microscopy technique that allows us to label a specific subset of mitochondria and track their interactions, providing direct, visual proof of fusion through the mixing of their internal components [@problem_id:2323901].", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the dynamics of the mitochondrial network within a living eukaryotic cell. To do this, researchers transfect the cell with a plasmid encoding a Photoactivatable Green Fluorescent Protein (paGFP) that is fused to a mitochondrial targeting sequence. This ensures the paGFP protein is synthesized and exclusively imported into the mitochondrial matrix. The paGFP protein is initially non-fluorescent. However, upon exposure to a brief pulse of 405 nm laser light, it undergoes an irreversible conformational change and becomes fluorescent, emitting green light when excited by a 488 nm laser.\n\nIn the experiment, a researcher uses a confocal microscope to focus the 405 nm activating laser onto a small, specific region of the cell, photoactivating only the subpopulation of mitochondria within that zone. Immediately following this activation, the entire cell is imaged over time using the 488 nm laser to track the location of the now-fluorescent green protein.\n\nWhich of the following observations would provide the most direct evidence that mitochondrial fusion is occurring in the cell?\n\nA. The green fluorescence, initially localized to a few mitochondria, gradually spreads throughout the cell's mitochondrial network, appearing in mitochondria that were outside the original photoactivation region.\n\nB. The initially activated green mitochondria are observed to elongate and then divide into smaller, distinct green mitochondrial fragments.\n\nC. The green fluorescence remains strictly confined to the mitochondria that were initially in the photoactivation zone, and these mitochondria do not mix with their neighbors.\n\nD. The green fluorescence intensity within the initially activated mitochondria decreases uniformly and rapidly over time, eventually disappearing completely without spreading to other mitochondria.\n\nE. The green fluorescence is observed to leak out from the initially activated mitochondria and become diffuse throughout the cell's cytoplasm.", "solution": "The experimental design places photoactivatable GFP specifically in the mitochondrial matrix, where it remains confined unless inner membrane continuity is established with another mitochondrion. Photoactivation in a small region labels the matrix content of only those mitochondria in that region. Mitochondrial fusion is defined by the merging of both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, generating a continuous matrix compartment between the fusing partners. A direct consequence is the equilibration of soluble matrix contents, such as paGFP, between previously separate mitochondria.\n\nTherefore, the most direct evidence of fusion in this setup is the redistribution of the fluorescent matrix marker from the initially activated mitochondria to other mitochondria that were not activated, indicating exchange of matrix contents via fusion.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A describes the spread of green fluorescence from the activated subset to other mitochondria outside the original activation zone. This indicates matrix content mixing through membrane fusion and directly evidences fusion dynamics across the network.\n- Option B describes elongation followed by division into smaller green fragments, which is mitochondrial fission, not fusion, and shows no mixing with nonactivated mitochondria.\n- Option C indicates that labeled mitochondria remain isolated with no mixing, consistent with an absence of fusion.\n- Option D indicates loss of signal without spread, consistent with photobleaching or protein turnover, not fusion-mediated content exchange.\n- Option E indicates leakage of fluorescence into the cytoplasm, implying loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity, not fusion.\n\nThus, the observation that most directly evidences mitochondrial fusion is the appearance of green fluorescence in mitochondria outside the initial activation region due to matrix content mixing, as described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2323901"}, {"introduction": "Cellular processes are deeply interconnected, often competing for the same limited pool of molecular machinery. This problem elevates our understanding from a qualitative to a quantitative level, modeling a scenario where both mitochondria and peroxisomes require the same fission protein, Drp1. By working through this hypothetical model, you will explore how a change in one organelle system can have predictable, cascading effects on another, a key principle of systems biology [@problem_id:2323899].", "problem": "In a study of organelle dynamics, a cell biologist is investigating a human cell line using a simplified model. The morphology of the mitochondrial network is quantified by its steady-state average aspect ratio (AR), defined as the ratio of its length to its width. The network's structure is maintained by a balance between mitochondrial fission (division) and fusion (merging).\n\nBoth mitochondrial fission and peroxisomal fission are critically dependent on the recruitment of Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) from a common, finite cytosolic pool. The model is based on the following principles:\n1.  The rate of mitochondrial fusion is assumed to be constant under all conditions.\n2.  The steady-state mitochondrial aspect ratio (AR) is inversely proportional to the rate of mitochondrial fission.\n3.  The rate of mitochondrial fission is directly proportional to the amount of Drp1 allocated to the mitochondria.\n4.  The total pool of active Drp1 is distributed between mitochondria and peroxisomes in direct proportion to their relative 'recruitment demands'.\n\nIn the normal, wild-type (WT) version of this cell line, the mitochondrial network has a steady-state aspect ratio of $AR_{WT} = 2.5$. Under these conditions, it is determined that 70% of the active cytosolic Drp1 pool is allocated to mitochondrial fission and the remaining 30% is allocated to peroxisomal fission.\n\nA mutation is then introduced into the cell line, causing runaway peroxisomal proliferation. This significantly increases the number of peroxisomes, which consequently increases the total Drp1 recruitment demand from the peroxisomal population by a factor of 4.\n\nAssuming the total cellular concentration of Drp1 and the intrinsic rate of mitochondrial fusion remain constant, calculate the new steady-state average aspect ratio of the mitochondria in the mutant cell line. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the total active Drp1 pool be constant. Let the mitochondrial and peroxisomal recruitment demands in the wild type be $R_{m}$ and $R_{p}$, respectively.
