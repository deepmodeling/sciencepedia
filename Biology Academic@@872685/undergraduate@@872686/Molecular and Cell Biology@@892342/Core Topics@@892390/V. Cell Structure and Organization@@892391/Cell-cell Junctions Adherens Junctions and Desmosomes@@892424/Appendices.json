The primary adhesion molecules mediating these connections are members of the cadherin protein family. Consider a healthy, confluent monolayer of epithelial cells grown in a culture dish with a standard growth medium. This monolayer is then treated with a solution containing ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a well-known chelating agent that specifically binds to and removes free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the extracellular environment.\n\nBased on your understanding of the molecular architecture of adherens junctions and desmosomes, what is the most direct and immediate molecular consequence of treating this epithelial monolayer with EGTA?\n\nA. The intracellular plaque proteins (catenins and desmoplakin) will detach from the actin and intermediate filaments, respectively.\n\nB. The extracellular domains of the cadherin proteins will undergo a conformational change, disrupting their ability to bind to cadherins on adjacent cells.\n\nC. ATP-dependent transport mechanisms will be inhibited, preventing the delivery of new cadherin molecules to the cell surface.\n\nD. The chelating agent will cross the plasma membrane and cause the denaturation of the intracellular domains of the cadherin proteins.\n\nE. The cells will immediately initiate apoptosis (programmed cell death) as a result of losing contact-dependent survival signals.", "solution": "Adherens junctions are mediated by classical cadherins (e.g., E-cadherin) that connect to actin via catenins, and desmosomes are mediated by desmogleins and desmocollins (desmosomal cadherins) that connect to intermediate filaments via plakoglobin and desmoplakin. A defining biochemical property of all cadherins is their strict dependence on extracellular calcium ions: multiple $Ca^{2+}$ ions bind at the linker regions between extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, conferring a rigid, extended conformation that is required for both cis clustering and trans homophilic binding to cadherins on adjacent cells.\n\nEGTA is an extracellular chelator with high affinity for $Ca^{2+}$. Upon addition to the medium, EGTA rapidly lowers free extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, leading to dissociation of $Ca^{2+}$ from the extracellular domains of cadherins. The immediate molecular consequence is a conformational change of the cadherin ectodomains from a rigid, adhesive state to a flexible, non-adhesive state, which disrupts trans cadherin-cadherin interactions at cell-cell contacts.\n\nBy contrast, the intracellular plaque attachments (catenins to actin; desmoplakin to intermediate filaments) do not directly depend on extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ and are not the most immediate targets of EGTA (ruling out A). EGTA does not inhibit ATP-dependent trafficking mechanisms (ruling out C), is not membrane permeant and does not denature intracellular cadherin domains (ruling out D), and loss of adhesion can lead to signaling changes and potential anoikis, but apoptosis is not the most direct and immediate molecular event upon acute $Ca^{2+}$ chelation (ruling out E). Therefore, the most direct and immediate molecular consequence is the loss of $Ca^{2+}$-dependent cadherin ectodomain conformation and trans binding.\n\nHence, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2308104"}, {"introduction": "Having established the basic mechanism of cadherin adhesion, we now explore the functional specialization between adherens junctions and desmosomes. This scenario [@problem_id:2308059] asks you to predict the outcome of a mechanical stress test on an epithelial sheet specifically lacking desmosomes. Solving this will clarify the distinct and complementary roles these two junction types play in conferring mechanical resilience to tissues.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying the mechanical properties of epithelial tissues. They culture two types of epithelial cells on separate culture plates until they form confluent monolayers (a single, continuous layer of cells).\n\n- The first cell type is a wild-type (WT) line, which forms all normal cell-cell junctions.\n- The second cell type is a genetically modified mutant (MT) line. These cells are specifically engineered to be unable to produce desmoglein and desmocollin, key proteins required for the formation of desmosomes. However, their ability to form other junctions, particularly adherens junctions, is completely normal.\n\nBoth monolayers are then subjected to an identical experiment: a controlled, high-velocity fluid flow is passed over their surface to apply a significant shearing force. Based on your understanding of the functions of cell-cell junctions, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed?\n\nA. The MT monolayer will be significantly more fragile and will break apart, with cells separating from each other, while the WT monolayer remains largely intact.\n\nB. Both the WT and MT monolayers will demonstrate comparable resistance to the shearing force, as the presence of adherens junctions is sufficient for mechanical integrity.\n\nC. The MT monolayer will be more resistant to the shearing force than the WT monolayer, as the lack of rigid desmosomes allows the layer to deform more easily without breaking.\n\nD. The MT cells will be unable to form a confluent monolayer in the first place, as desmosomes are essential for the initial establishment of cell-cell contacts.", "solution": "The mechanical integrity of epithelial monolayers arises from complementary cell-cell junctions that couple the cytoskeletons of neighboring cells.\n\nStep 1: Define the relevant junctions and their cytoskeletal linkages.\n- Adherens junctions are mediated by classical cadherins (e.g., E-cadherin) that connect to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins. They are crucial for the initiation of cell-cell adhesion, maintenance of cell shape, and transmission of tensile forces across cells.\n- Desmosomes are mediated by desmoglein and desmocollin (desmosomal cadherins) that connect to intermediate filaments (e.g., keratins) via plakoglobin and desmoplakin. They provide robust mechanical coupling and confer high resistance to shear and stretch, especially in mechanically stressed epithelia (e.g., skin, heart).\n\nStep 2: Identify the engineered defect and its direct consequence.\n- The mutant cells lack desmoglein and desmocollin, so they cannot form desmosomes, but retain normal adherens junctions. Therefore, they can still establish initial cell-cell adhesion and confluence through adherens junctions. This rules out the assertion that desmosomes are essential for the initial establishment of contacts; thus, option D is inconsistent with the known role of adherens junctions in initiating adhesion.\n\nStep 3: Predict the response to high shearing force based on mechanics of junction-cytoskeleton coupling.\n- Shear forces require strong intercellular anchoring that can distribute stress across the tissue. Desmosomes, by linking intermediate filament networks between cells, form a rugged, stress-dissipating lattice that is particularly effective against shear and stretch. Without desmosomes, the mechanical load must be borne predominantly by adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton, which are less effective in resisting high shear and more prone to failure under such conditions. Therefore, the mutant monolayer will exhibit decreased mechanical integrity and is more likely to rupture or have cells separate under shear, while the wild-type monolayer with intact desmosomes is expected to remain comparatively intact.\n\nStep 4: Exclude alternatives based on known pathophysiology and mechanics.\n- Option B is unlikely because adherens junctions alone generally do not provide the same resistance to high mechanical stress as the combined adherens-desmosome network; clinical correlates (e.g., desmosomal protein defects) show tissue fragility.\n- Option C is incorrect because increased deformability due to loss of rigid desmosomal coupling does not translate to increased resistance; rather, it reflects a weakened load-bearing network unable to distribute shear effectively.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is that the mutant monolayer is significantly more fragile under shear, whereas the wild-type remains largely intact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2308059"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem delves into the dynamic nature of adherens junctions as mechanosensory structures that adapt to physical forces. You will analyze hypothetical data from a sophisticated experiment [@problem_id:2308038] that uses fluorescent proteins and molecular mutations to dissect how mechanical tension and protein phosphorylation work together to reinforce cell-cell adhesion. This quantitative exercise reflects how modern cell biologists investigate the complex regulatory networks that control tissue mechanics.", "problem": "In epithelial cells, adherens junctions are crucial for maintaining tissue integrity. These junctions are mediated by E-cadherin, whose cytoplasmic domain is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via a complex of proteins including α-catenin and β-catenin. The strength of this linkage is dynamic and responds to mechanical forces. A key event in this mechanotransduction is the tension-dependent recruitment of the protein vinculin to α-catenin. When α-catenin is under mechanical tension, it is thought to unfold, exposing a binding site for vinculin, thereby reinforcing the junction.\n\nA research group hypothesizes that this tension-dependent recruitment of vinculin is not solely a mechanical process but is also regulated by phosphorylation. Specifically, they propose that the phosphorylation of a particular tyrosine residue on α-catenin, Y654, is a critical step that enhances vinculin binding under tension.\n\nTo test this, they perform an experiment using cells engineered to lack their own α-catenin. They introduce one of three different versions of α-catenin, each tagged with a Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP). The cells also express vinculin tagged with a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP). The three versions of α-catenin are:\n1.  Wild-Type (WT) α-catenin.\n2.  A phosphomimetic mutant (α-catenin Y654E), where the tyrosine at position 654 is replaced by glutamate, mimicking a state of permanent phosphorylation.\n3.  A phosphodeficient mutant (α-catenin Y654F), where the tyrosine is replaced by phenylalanine, which cannot be phosphorylated.\n\nThe interaction between α-catenin and vinculin is quantified by measuring the Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) efficiency between the CFP on α-catenin and the YFP on vinculin. The FRET efficiency is a direct quantitative measure of the average amount of vinculin recruited to each α-catenin molecule. These cells are grown on a flexible substrate that can be stretched to apply a uniform high tension state. The average FRET efficiencies for each cell type under relaxed (low tension) and stretched (high tension) conditions are recorded in the table below.\n\n| α-catenin Construct | FRET Efficiency (Low Tension) | FRET Efficiency (High Tension) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Wild-Type (WT) | 0.105 | 0.405 |\n| Y654E (phosphomimetic) | 0.120 | 0.615 |\n| Y654F (phosphodeficient)| 0.105 | 0.180 |\n\nBased on this data, quantify how constitutive phosphorylation affects the tension-sensing response.

Let's denote the recruitment measure as $R$, so $R$ is equal to the FRET efficiency value provided in the table.\n\nThe tension-induced change in recruitment, which we can denote as $\\Delta R$, is the difference between the recruitment under high tension and the recruitment under low tension for a given construct.\n$$ \\Delta R = R_{\\text{high tension}} - R_{\\text{low tension}} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the tension-induced change in recruitment for the Wild-Type (WT) α-catenin.
