{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The endomembrane system is a highly organized trafficking network. For a protein destined for secretion, modification, or delivery to certain organelles, its journey begins with a crucial first step: entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This entry is not automatic; it requires a specific molecular \"ticket\" known as a signal peptide. This practice [@problem_id:2341578] explores the fundamental consequences of a defective signal peptide, forcing us to consider the cell's default pathway for newly synthesized proteins that fail to present the correct credentials for ER entry.", "problem": "A biotechnology research team is engineering a eukaryotic cell line to produce and secrete a therapeutic protein called \"Protease-A\". The gene for Protease-A includes a standard N-terminal signal sequence that directs the newly synthesized protein into the secretory pathway, beginning at the endoplasmic reticulum. For the protein to be secreted, it must successfully enter this pathway.\n\nDuring a routine production run, the team discovers that while the cells are producing functional Protease-A at the expected rate, none of the protein is being secreted into the extracellular medium. A genetic analysis of this cell batch reveals a single, specific mutation in the Protease-A gene. This mutation has altered the coding sequence for the N-terminal signal peptide, rendering it completely non-functional. The mutation does not affect the translation, folding, or enzymatic activity of the rest of the Protease-A protein.\n\nAssuming all other cellular machinery for protein synthesis and transport is functioning correctly, where would the fully synthesized Protease-A protein molecules be expected to predominantly accumulate within these mutant cells?\n\nA. In the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum\n\nB. In the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus\n\nC. In the cytosol\n\nD. In secretory vesicles awaiting exocytosis\n\nE. In the extracellular medium, but in a misfolded state", "solution": "- Secretory pathway entry in eukaryotic cells requires an N-terminal signal peptide on the nascent polypeptide to be recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it engages the Sec61 translocon. Translation then resumes with co-translational translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen, after which the signal peptide is typically cleaved. From there, proteins proceed ER lumen → Golgi apparatus → secretory vesicles → extracellular space.\n\n- If the N-terminal signal peptide is non-functional, SRP cannot recognize or bind the nascent chain. Consequently, the ribosome does not dock at the ER, and translation proceeds to completion on free ribosomes in the cytosol. In the absence of any other targeting signals (e.g., nuclear localization sequence, mitochondrial targeting signal, or peroxisomal targeting signal), the default localization of the fully synthesized protein is the cytosol.\n\n- The problem states: the only mutation renders the N-terminal signal peptide non-functional, while translation, folding, and enzymatic activity of the rest of the protein are unaffected, and all other cellular machinery is intact. Therefore, the protein will not enter the ER and thus cannot reach the Golgi, secretory vesicles, or extracellular space.\n\n- Evaluating options:\n  A. In the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum: requires a functional signal peptide and SRP-mediated targeting; not possible.\n  B. In the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus: requires prior ER entry; not possible.\n  C. In the cytosol: default localization when no functional ER signal peptide is present; expected outcome.\n  D. In secretory vesicles awaiting exocytosis: requires ER and Golgi transit; not possible.\n  E. In the extracellular medium, but in a misfolded state: secretion cannot occur without ER entry; misfolding is not implicated by the mutation.\n\n- Therefore, the fully synthesized Protease-A will predominantly accumulate in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341578"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein has successfully entered the ER lumen, it must be transported to the next major processing station, the Golgi apparatus. This movement relies on a sophisticated \"conveyor belt\" system composed of transport vesicles. This problem [@problem_id:2341595] examines the role of a specific type of vesicle coat, COPII, which is essential for budding vesicles from the ER. By simulating the inhibition of this machinery, we can pinpoint its critical function in the anterograde flow of materials through the secretory pathway.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying a novel small-molecule inhibitor, named Vesiculostatin A. Through a series of biochemical assays, it is determined that Vesiculostatin A specifically and potently prevents the GTP-binding protein Sar1 from anchoring to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This action effectively blocks the subsequent assembly of Coat Protein Complex II (COPII) vesicles.\n\nBased on this specific mechanism of action, which of the following transport pathways within the endomembrane system would be most directly and immediately inhibited in cells treated with Vesiculostatin A?\n\nA. Transport of newly synthesized proteins and lipids from the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.\n\nB. Retrieval of resident Endoplasmic Reticulum proteins from the Golgi apparatus back to the Endoplasmic Reticulum.\n\nC. Internalization of extracellular materials via receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane.\n\nD. Delivery of hydrolytic enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to late endosomes.\n\nE. The fusion of mature secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane for exocytosis.", "solution": "Sar1 is a small GTP-binding protein that initiates COPII vesicle formation at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites. In its GTP-bound state, Sar1 exposes an N-terminal amphipathic helix that inserts into the ER membrane, anchoring Sar1 and nucleating the COPII coat by recruiting Sec23/24 and Sec13/31. This coat assembly drives budding of COPII vesicles that mediate anterograde transport of newly synthesized proteins and lipids from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. If Vesiculostatin A prevents Sar1 from anchoring to the ER membrane, COPII assembly is acutely blocked, thereby directly and immediately inhibiting ER-to-Golgi transport.\n\nBy contrast, retrieval of ER-resident proteins from the Golgi (retrograde transport) is mediated by COPI coats and the ARF1 GTPase, not Sar1, so it is not directly inhibited. Receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane relies on clathrin and dynamin, not COPII. Delivery from the trans-Golgi network to late endosomes uses clathrin adaptors (such as AP-1 or GGAs) and ARF1, not COPII. Fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane for exocytosis is governed by Rab GTPases and SNAREs, not Sar1. Therefore, the transport step most directly and immediately inhibited by blocking Sar1 membrane anchoring is ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2341595"}, {"introduction": "After processing in the Golgi, proteins must be sorted and dispatched to their correct final destinations. While many proteins follow a default pathway to the plasma membrane for secretion, others require specific sorting signals for delivery elsewhere. This exercise [@problem_id:2341613] investigates one such signal, the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tag, which earmarks enzymes for the lysosome. Understanding what happens when this M6P tag cannot be added reveals not only the mechanism of lysosomal targeting but also reinforces the concept of a constitutive secretory pathway as the cell's default exit route.", "problem": "Researchers are studying a rare cellular defect. Cells with this defect show a significant accumulation of undigested macromolecules, suggesting a problem with lysosomal function. Upon analysis, it is found that the lysosomal hydrolase enzymes are synthesized and are catalytically active. However, they are largely absent from the lysosomes. The defect is traced to a complete failure to add the Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) targeting signal to these enzymes as they pass through the Golgi apparatus. In eukaryotic cells, proteins that enter the endoplasmic reticulum but lack a specific retention or targeting signal are directed along a default pathway.\n\nGiven this information, what is the most probable location of the mis-sorted lysosomal hydrolases in these defective cells?\n\nA. The cytosol\n\nB. The extracellular space\n\nC. The mitochondrial matrix\n\nD. The nucleus\n\nE. The peroxisome", "solution": "1) Lysosomal hydrolases are synthesized with an N-terminal signal sequence that directs co-translational translocation into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once in the ER lumen, they enter the secretory pathway and are no longer in the cytosol.\n\n2) Proper targeting of these hydrolases to lysosomes requires the addition of the Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) tag in the cis-Golgi, mediated by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. The M6P tag allows binding to M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network, packaging into clathrin-coated vesicles, and delivery to endosomes/lysosomes.\n\n3) In the described defect, there is a complete failure to add the M6P tag. Without this lysosomal targeting signal, the hydrolases cannot bind M6P receptors and thus cannot be sorted into the lysosomal delivery pathway.\n\n4) In eukaryotic cells, proteins that have entered the ER but lack specific retention or targeting signals proceed by the default constitutive secretory pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, where they are exocytosed into the extracellular space.\n\n5) Therefore, the mis-sorted lysosomal hydrolases will be secreted and found predominantly in the extracellular space, not in the cytosol (they already entered the ER), nor in mitochondria, nucleus, or peroxisomes (each of which requires distinct, absent targeting signals).\n\nThus, the most probable location is the extracellular space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2341613"}]}
