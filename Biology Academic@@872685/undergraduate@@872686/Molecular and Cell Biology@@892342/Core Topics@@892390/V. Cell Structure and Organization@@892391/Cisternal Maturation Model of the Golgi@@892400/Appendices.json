Two proteins are of interest:\n1.  **Secretin-X**: A newly synthesized polypeptide that is destined for secretion from the cell.\n2.  **GlycoSynth-M**: A resident enzyme whose primary function and location are within the *medial*-Golgi cisternae.\n\nBoth proteins are tagged with a fluorescent marker at the time of their synthesis in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), allowing their subsequent locations to be tracked. The Golgi stack is organized into *cis* (entry face), *medial*, and *trans* (exit face) cisternae, followed by the trans-Golgi Network (TGN). It is known that Coat Protein Complex I (COPI)-coated vesicles are responsible for retrograde transport within the Golgi.\n\nBased on the cisternal maturation model, which of the following statements most accurately describes the predominant pathways for Secretin-X and GlycoSynth-M after they depart from the ER?\n\nA. **Secretin-X**: Progresses from cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> TGN.\n   **GlycoSynth-M**: Progresses from cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> TGN.\n\nB. **Secretin-X**: Progresses from cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> TGN.\n   **GlycoSynth-M**: Resides in the medial-Golgi, and is continuously transported via COPI vesicles from the medial-Golgi back to the cis-Golgi.\n\nC. **Secretin-X**: Is transported from the TGN -> trans-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> cis-Golgi before secretion.\n   **GlycoSynth-M**: Progresses from cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> TGN.\n\nD. **Secretin-X**: Progresses from cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> TGN.\n   **GlycoSynth-M**: Arrives at the medial-Golgi and is later retrieved from the trans-Golgi via COPI vesicles and returned to the medial-Golgi.\n\nE. **Secretin-X**: Is retrieved from the trans-Golgi via COPI vesicles and returned to the medial-Golgi.\n   **GlycoSynth-M**: Progresses from cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> TGN.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the trafficking pathways of a secreted protein (Secretin-X) and a resident Golgi enzyme (GlycoSynth-M) according to the cisternal maturation model.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Cisternal Maturation Model.**\nThe core principle of the cisternal maturation model is that the Golgi cisternae are dynamic structures that are formed at the *cis* face and mature as they move through the stack, eventually breaking up at the *trans* face to form the trans-Golgi Network (TGN). In this model, cargo proteins, such as those destined for secretion, largely remain within the lumen of a single cisterna as it undergoes this maturation process. The enzymes that define each compartment (*cis*, *medial*, *trans*) are not static; they must be continuously sorted and returned to their proper location.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the pathway for the secreted protein, Secretin-X.**\nSecretin-X is a cargo protein intended for secretion. According to the cisternal maturation model, after leaving the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and entering the *cis*-Golgi, Secretin-X will be carried forward as the cisterna it is in matures.\n- It starts in a *cis*-cisterna.\n- This cisterna matures into a *medial*-cisterna, carrying Secretin-X with it.\n- The *medial*-cisterna then matures into a *trans*-cisterna.\n- Finally, the *trans*-cisterna becomes part of the TGN, from where Secretin-X will be packaged into a secretory vesicle and sent to the plasma membrane for exocytosis.\nTherefore, the pathway for Secretin-X is a linear progression: ER -> cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> TGN.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the pathway for the resident enzyme, GlycoSynth-M.**\nGlycoSynth-M is a resident enzyme of the *medial*-Golgi. Its journey also begins at the ER and it enters the *cis*-Golgi. It then moves to the *medial*-Golgi as the cisterna matures. This is its primary site of function.\nHowever, because the cisterna itself continues to mature, GlycoSynth-M will be passively carried forward from the *medial*-Golgi to the *trans*-Golgi. To maintain its high concentration in the *medial*-Golgi compartment and prevent its loss, the cell must have a retrieval mechanism.\nThis retrieval is accomplished by retrograde transport. GlycoSynth-M molecules that have been carried to the *trans*-Golgi are recognized, packaged into Coat Protein Complex I (COPI)-coated vesicles, and transported backward to fuse with a *medial*-Golgi cisterna.\nThis creates a cyclical pathway for GlycoSynth-M: it is constantly being carried forward by cisternal maturation and actively returned by retrograde transport. The net effect is its \"residence\" in the medial-Golgi. So, it arrives at the medial-Golgi, is carried forward to the trans-Golgi, and is then retrieved from the trans-Golgi and sent back to the medial-Golgi.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the derived pathways with the given options.**\n\n- **Option A:** Incorrect. It suggests both proteins follow the same purely forward pathway, failing to account for the retrieval mechanism required for the resident enzyme.\n- **Option B:** Incorrect. It correctly identifies the forward path for Secretin-X, but mischaracterizes the retrieval loop for GlycoSynth-M. The retrieval isn't from *medial* to *cis*; it is from a later compartment (*trans*) back to the enzyme's home compartment (*medial*).\n- **Option C:** Incorrect. It describes the forward pathway for Secretin-X in reverse.\n- **Option D:** Correct. It accurately describes the linear, forward progression of the secreted cargo protein (Secretin-X: cis -> medial -> trans -> TGN) and the cyclical, retrieval-based pathway of the resident enzyme (GlycoSynth-M: arrives at medial-Golgi, is later retrieved from the trans-Golgi via COPI vesicles and returned to the medial-Golgi).\n- **Option E:** Incorrect. It swaps the roles of the two proteins, suggesting the secreted protein is retrieved and the resident enzyme is secreted.\n\nThus, the most accurate description is provided in Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2309768"}, {"introduction": "A robust scientific model must make testable predictions that can be verified by experiments. This practice [@problem_id:2309734] immerses you in the logic of experimental cell biology, asking you to interpret the results of a state-of-the-art live-cell imaging experiment. By analyzing a scenario that uses photo-convertible proteins, you can visualize in your mind's eye the key evidence for cisternal maturation: a single structure containing cargo that is seen to progressively change its enzymatic identity from *cis* to *trans*.", "problem": "To investigate the mechanism of protein transport through the Golgi apparatus, a cell biologist designs a sophisticated live-cell imaging experiment. The two primary competing hypotheses are the vesicular transport model, where static cisternae exchange cargo via vesicles, and the cisternal maturation model, where the cisternae themselves progress from a *cis*- to a *trans*-identity, carrying cargo along with them.\n\nThe experiment uses a cell line engineered to co-express three different fusion proteins:\n1.  **Cargo Protein:** A secreted protein named \"Luminogen\" is fused to Dendra2, a photo-convertible fluorescent protein. The resulting fusion, Luminogen-Dendra2, initially fluoresces green. However, upon irradiation with 405 nm light, it irreversibly converts to a red-fluorescing form.\n2.  **cis-Golgi Marker:** A resident enzyme of the *cis*-Golgi, Cis-Mannosidase II, is fused to a stable Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP). This marker is designated CisManII-CFP.\n3.  **trans-Golgi Marker:** A resident enzyme of the *trans*-Golgi, Trans-Galactosyltransferase, is fused to a stable Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP). This marker is designated TransGalT-YFP.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows: At the start of the observation (time $t=0$), a focused pulse of 405 nm light is applied to the *cis*-face of the Golgi stack. At this location, newly synthesized, green-fluorescing Luminogen-Dendra2, recently arrived from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), is concentrated. This \"pulse\" of light converts the cohort of cargo molecules within a single *cis*-cisterna to their red-fluorescing form. The cell is then monitored over time, tracking the relative positions of the red cargo signal, the cyan *cis*-marker, and the yellow *trans*-marker.\n\nWhich of the following time-course observations would provide the most direct and compelling evidence in support of the cisternal maturation model of Golgi transport?\n\nA. At $t=0$, the red cargo signal is colocalized with the cyan *cis*-marker. Over time, this single red-labeled structure is observed to traffic across the Golgi stack. During its transit, the cyan signal associated with the structure diminishes and is gradually replaced by a yellow signal. Eventually, the red cargo is seen colocalized with the yellow *trans*-marker within the same mobile structure, just before the red signal disperses into secretory vesicles.\n\nB. At $t=0$, the red cargo signal is colocalized with the cyan *cis*-marker in a stationary cisterna. Shortly after, small, red-fluorescing vesicles are seen budding off from this cyan-labeled cisterna. These red vesicles then move to and fuse with a separate, stationary, yellow-labeled *trans*-cisterna.\n\nC. Immediately after photo-conversion, the red cargo signal, initially localized to a single cisterna, rapidly disperses and spreads throughout the entire Golgi stack, resulting in a diffuse red glow that partially overlaps with both the cyan and yellow markers across multiple cisternae.\n\nD. At $t=0$, the red cargo signal is colocalized with the cyan *cis*-marker. This combined red-cyan structure moves as a single, intact unit from the *cis*- to the *trans*-face of the Golgi. The structure never loses its cyan signal or acquires the yellow signal before it breaks apart at the *trans*-face.\n\nE. After photo-conversion at the *cis*-Golgi, the red cargo signal is observed to be packaged into vesicles that move back towards and fuse with the Endoplasmic Reticulum, indicating a failure of the cargo to progress through the secretory pathway.", "solution": "- Define the competing model predictions:\n  - Vesicular transport model: Golgi cisternae are stationary. Anterograde cargo is transported forward by small vesicles that bud from a donor cisterna and fuse with a more distal cisterna. Prediction: after photo-conversion at $t=0$, red cargo should bud off as small vesicles from the cyan-labeled cis cisterna and appear in a separate, stationary trans cisterna marked by yellow, without the donor cisterna itself changing identity. The cyan and yellow resident markers remain in their respective cisternae; the structure containing cargo does not progressively exchange resident markers.\n  - Cisternal maturation model: A cisterna containing cargo physically progresses from a cis identity to a trans identity by acquiring and losing resident enzymes through retrograde vesicle traffic. Prediction: after photo-conversion at $t=0$, the same red-labeled cisterna will move across the stack, initially colocalized with the cyan cis marker, then progressively losing cyan and gaining yellow as it matures, ultimately colocalizing with the yellow trans marker before cargo exits in secretory vesicles. The key signature is the progressive exchange of resident markers on the same cargo-bearing structure over time.\n\n- Map each observation to model predictions:\n  - Option A: At $t=0$, red cargo colocalizes with cyan; the same red-labeled structure moves across the stack; cyan diminishes and is gradually replaced by yellow; finally red cargo colocalizes with yellow in the same structure before dispersal. This matches the cisternal maturation prediction of a single cargo-bearing cisterna that changes identity from cis to trans via progressive exchange of resident markers.\n  - Option B: Red cargo buds as small vesicles from a stationary cyan cisterna and fuses with a stationary yellow trans cisterna. This is the defining prediction of vesicular transport, not cisternal maturation.\n  - Option C: Rapid global dispersion of red signal into a diffuse pattern across multiple cisternae, partially overlapping with both markers. This suggests nonspecific mixing or loss of compartmental integrity and does not provide evidence for cisternal maturation.\n  - Option D: The red-cyan structure moves intact but never loses cyan or gains yellow before breaking apart. This contradicts the required progressive exchange of resident enzymes inherent to cisternal maturation.\n  - Option E: Retrograde movement of red cargo to the Endoplasmic Reticulum indicates failure to progress through the Golgi and does not test the forward transport mechanism.\n\n- Conclusion: The observation that directly demonstrates a single cargo-bearing cisterna progressively exchanging resident markers from cyan to yellow while traversing the stack is the hallmark of cisternal maturation.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and compelling evidence for the cisternal maturation model is described by Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2309734"}, {"introduction": "The cisternal maturation model relies on the constant, backward (retrograde) transport of resident enzymes to maintain the specific character of each Golgi compartment.

This exercise highlights the critical importance of high-fidelity molecular sorting for the long-term stability and function of cellular organelles.", "problem": "The Golgi apparatus is a central organelle in the secretory pathway, responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids. According to the cisternal maturation model, new cisternae are formed at the *cis*-face of the Golgi and progressively mature as they move towards the *trans*-face. This maturation involves changes in the enzymatic content of the cisternae. A key feature of this model is the retrograde transport of resident Golgi enzymes. For example, enzymes that function in the *cis*-Golgi must be retrieved from older (*medial* and *trans*) cisternae and transported back to younger ones to maintain the polarity of the Golgi stack.\n\nConsider a simplified Golgi apparatus consisting of three distinct compartments in sequence: *cis*, *medial*, and *trans*. A specific resident enzyme is synthesized and correctly localized to the *cis*-cisterna. As this cisterna matures and becomes a *medial*-cisterna, a specialized retrieval machinery attempts to capture the resident *cis*-enzyme and transport it back to the *cis*-compartment. A similar retrieval process occurs when the *medial*-cisterna matures into a *trans*-cisterna.\n\nSuppose a genetic mutation causes this retrieval machinery to become partially defective. Its efficiency, defined as the fraction of enzyme successfully captured and returned from a maturing cisterna at each step, drops to 50%. The remaining fraction of the enzyme is not retrieved and is carried forward to the next compartment. Assume the system reaches a steady state, where the relative distribution of this resident enzyme across the *cis*, *medial*, and *trans* compartments becomes constant over time.\n\nCalculate the fraction of the total population of this resident *cis*-enzyme within the entire Golgi stack that is incorrectly located in the *trans*-cisterna at steady state. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $C$, $M$, and $T$ represent the amount of the resident *cis*-enzyme in the *cis*, *medial*, and *trans* compartments, respectively, at steady state. Let $S$ be the rate of synthesis of new enzyme, which enters the *cis* compartment.\n\nThe problem states that the retrieval efficiency is 50% ($r=0.5$). This means at each maturation step, 50% of the enzyme is carried forward (leaks), and 50% is retrieved. The problem also specifies that this is a resident *cis*-enzyme, so all retrieval pathways transport the enzyme back to the *cis*-compartment.\n\nWe can set up a system of equations based on the flow of the enzyme at steady state, where the total flow into each compartment equals the total flow out.\n\n1.  **For the *medial* compartment (M):**\n    *   **Flow In:** Enzyme leaks from the *cis* compartment as it matures.
