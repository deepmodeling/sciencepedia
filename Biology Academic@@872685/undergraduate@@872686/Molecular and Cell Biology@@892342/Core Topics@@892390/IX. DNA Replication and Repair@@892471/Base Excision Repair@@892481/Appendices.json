{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding a complex molecular pathway like Base Excision Repair (BER) often begins with dissecting its first critical steps. This practice problem uses a classic experimental setup involving plasmid DNA to visualize the immediate consequences of initiating BER. By comparing a normal cellular environment with one lacking a key enzyme, Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG), you can deduce the enzyme's function and its effect on DNA topology [@problem_id:2305493].", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the initial steps of the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway in a bacterial cell extract. Researchers prepare a large quantity of a standard 4.5 kilobase-pair (kbp) circular plasmid. In its native state, this plasmid is supercoiled. A single uracil (U) base is incorporated into one strand of this double-stranded plasmid, opposite a guanine (G), creating a single U:G mispair.\n\nTwo separate reaction mixtures are prepared in identical buffer conditions suitable for DNA repair enzymes.\n- **Tube A**: Contains the uracil-containing plasmid and a cell-free extract from a wild-type bacterial strain. This extract contains all the necessary enzymes for DNA repair, including Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG).\n- **Tube B**: Contains the uracil-containing plasmid and a cell-free extract from a mutant bacterial strain that has a null mutation in the gene for UDG, meaning it completely lacks functional UDG enzyme. This extract is otherwise identical to the wild-type extract.\n\nAfter incubation for a time sufficient for the initial enzymatic steps of repair to occur, the contents of both tubes are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. On such a gel, the supercoiled plasmid migrates the fastest, the linear form migrates at an intermediate rate, and the nicked (open circular) form migrates the slowest.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the predominant form of the plasmid you would expect to observe in each tube?\n\nA. Tube A: Supercoiled; Tube B: Supercoiled\n\nB. Tube A: Nicked circular; Tube B: Supercoiled\n\nC. Tube A: Linear; Tube B: Nicked circular\n\nD. Tube A: Supercoiled; Tube B: Nicked circular\n\nE. Tube A: Nicked circular; Tube B: Nicked circular", "solution": "The plasmid starts as a covalently closed circular DNA that is supercoiled. A single-strand break (nick) is sufficient to relax supercoiling, converting it to the nicked (open circular) form, which migrates slowest on agarose gels, while the supercoiled form migrates fastest. The linear form would require a double-strand break, which is not generated by the initial steps of base excision repair.\n\nBase Excision Repair of a U:G mispair proceeds initially as follows:\n1) Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) removes the uracil base from the DNA, creating an abasic (AP) site in the sugar-phosphate backbone.\n2) An AP endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone at the AP site, generating a single-strand break (nick).\n3) DNA polymerase performs gap filling, and DNA ligase seals the nick; however, until ligation occurs, the DNA remains nicked and thus open circular.\n\nTube A contains UDG and all other BER enzymes. Therefore:\n- UDG excises U to form an AP site.\n- AP endonuclease incises at the AP site, producing a nick.\n- During the time window described as sufficient for initial steps, ligation is not assumed to be complete; thus the predominant product is nicked (open circular) DNA.\n\nTube B lacks UDG but is otherwise identical. Therefore:\n- No U excision occurs, no AP site is formed, and AP endonuclease has no substrate.\n- The plasmid remains covalently closed and supercoiled.\n\nLinear DNA is not expected in either tube because the initial BER steps create only a single-strand break, not a double-strand break.\n\nThus, Tube A will predominantly contain nicked circular plasmid, and Tube B will predominantly contain supercoiled plasmid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2305493"}, {"introduction": "After a DNA glycosylase removes a damaged base, the cell is left with an 'abasic' or AP site, an empty spot in the DNA helix. This intermediate is itself a form of damage that must be processed. This exercise challenges you to consider the indispensable role of AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1), the enzyme responsible for incising the DNA backbone at these AP sites, thereby paving the way for the subsequent repair machinery [@problem_id:2305512].", "problem": "Base Excision Repair (BER) is a critical cellular mechanism for correcting single-base DNA damage. The process is initiated by a DNA glycosylase, which recognizes and removes the damaged or incorrect base by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond, leaving behind an apurinic/apyrimidinic site, commonly known as an abasic (AP) site. The next step is carried out by an enzyme called AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1), which nicks the phosphodiester backbone immediately 5' to the AP site, creating a single-strand break that is a substrate for subsequent repair enzymes.\n\nConsider a human cell line that has a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding for APE1, rendering the protein completely non-functional. However, all other DNA repair proteins, including various DNA glycosylases, are fully functional. A C:G base pair in the DNA of one of these cells undergoes spontaneous deamination, converting the cytosine base to a uracil base.\n\nWhat will be the most likely state of the DNA at this specific site after the cell's BER machinery has had an opportunity to act?\n\nA. The DNA will contain a uracil base paired with a guanine base, as the repair pathway cannot be initiated.\n\nB. The DNA will have a single-strand break (a nick) in the phosphodiester backbone, and the abasic site will have been removed.\n\nC. The DNA will contain an abasic site where the uracil was, and the phosphodiester backbone will be intact at that location.\n\nD. The DNA strand will be fully repaired, with a normal cytosine base correctly paired with the guanine.\n\nE. The DNA will suffer a double-strand break at the site of the damage.", "solution": "1) Spontaneous deamination converts a cytosine in a C:G pair to uracil, producing a U:G mispair.\n\n2) BER initiation is performed by a DNA glycosylase specific for uracil (e.g., uracil DNA glycosylase). This enzyme recognizes the U:G mispair and cleaves the N-glycosidic bond of uracil, removing the base and leaving an abasic (AP) site. As a monofunctional glycosylase, it does not incise the phosphodiester backbone.\n\n3) In normal BER, the next step requires AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) to incise the DNA backbone immediately 5' to the AP site, generating a single-strand nick with a 3'-OH and a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate. This incision is essential to allow polymerase and ligase to complete repair.\n\n4) In the given cell, APE1 is completely non-functional. Therefore, the AP site generated by the glycosylase cannot be incised. No nick is formed, and downstream steps (gap filling and ligation) cannot proceed.\n\n5) Consequently, the most likely state of the lesion after the BER machinery acts is an intact phosphodiester backbone containing an unrepaired AP site at the position formerly occupied by uracil.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is that the DNA contains an abasic site with an intact backbone at that location.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2305512"}, {"introduction": "The completion of Base Excision Repair is not always straightforward and showcases the cell's sophisticated adaptability. While the 'short-patch' sub-pathway handles most simple lesions, certain intermediates can stall this process, requiring a more robust solution. This problem explores the elegant 'long-patch' BER pathway, an alternative route the cell employs to resolve such stalled intermediates, highlighting the coordinated action of a different set of enzymes to ensure genomic integrity is restored [@problem_id:1471566].", "problem": "In a specialized human cell line, a targeted mutation has rendered the 5'-deoxyribose phosphate ($5'-\\text{dRP}$) lyase domain of DNA Polymerase β (Pol β) catalytically inactive. However, its DNA polymerase activity remains fully functional. A spontaneous deamination of a cytosine residue to uracil occurs in the genome of one of these cells. The Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway is initiated: a uracil-DNA glycosylase excises the uracil, and AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1) subsequently incises the phosphodiester backbone 5' to the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. This creates a single-nucleotide gap flanked by a 3'-hydroxyl group and a $5'-\\text{dRP}$ moiety. Pol β successfully adds the correct cytosine nucleotide into the gap using its polymerase function. At this point, the standard short-patch BER pathway is stalled because the $5'-\\text{dRP}$ cannot be removed.\n\nFortunately, eukaryotic cells possess an alternative \"long-patch\" BER pathway to resolve such intermediates. Which of the following sets of enzymes is essential to take over from this stalled point and complete the repair process?\n\nA. Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a strand-displacing DNA polymerase (e.g., Polymerase δ), and DNA Ligase I.\n\nB. Reverse Transcriptase, RNase H, and DNA Ligase III.\n\nC.

In base excision repair (BER), uracil-DNA glycosylase removes the base to create an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1) incises the phosphodiester backbone 5' to the AP site, generating a single-nucleotide gap with a 3'-hydroxyl and a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate ($5'-\\text{dRP}$). DNA Polymerase beta (Pol beta) inserts the correct cytosine using the 3'-hydroxyl as a primer terminus. In short-patch BER, the $5'-\\text{dRP}$ would be removed by the $5'-\\text{dRP}$ lyase activity of Pol beta, followed by nick sealing by a ligase. However, in the described mutant, the $5'-\\text{dRP}$ lyase domain of Pol beta is inactive, so the $5'-\\text{dRP}$ cannot be removed and short-patch BER stalls.\n\nEukaryotic cells can switch to long-patch BER when the $5'-\\text{dRP}$ moiety cannot be removed. In long-patch BER, a strand-displacing DNA polymerase (commonly Polymerase delta or Polymerase epsilon, sometimes Pol beta with accessory factors) extends DNA synthesis past the lesion, displacing the strand containing the $5'-\\text{dRP}$ as a short 5' flap. Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1) recognizes and cleaves the resulting 5' flap to remove the displaced oligonucleotide that contains the $5'-\\text{dRP}$. Finally, DNA Ligase I seals the remaining nick to complete repair. Thus, the essential enzymes required from the stalled point are FEN1, a strand-displacing DNA polymerase, and DNA Ligase I.\n\nAssessment of answer choices:\n- A. Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a strand-displacing DNA polymerase (e.g., Polymerase delta), and DNA Ligase I: This exactly matches long-patch BER, which resolves a persistent $5'-\\text{dRP}$ by flap formation and cleavage, then ligation.\n- B. Reverse Transcriptase, RNase H, and DNA Ligase III: These function in retroviral replication and removal of RNA primers, not BER of a $5'-\\text{dRP}$-containing intermediate.\n- C. Exonuclease III, DNA Polymerase I, and DNA Ligase: These are bacterial enzymes; while they are functionally analogous in prokaryotic BER, they are not the relevant eukaryotic pathway components described.\n- D. DNA Photolyase and DNA Ligase I: Photolyase repairs ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers via photoreactivation, not AP-site-derived BER intermediates.\n- E. XPC-HR23B complex, TFIIH helicase, and DNA Polymerase eta: These are involved in nucleotide excision repair and translesion synthesis, not in long-patch BER resolution of a $5'-\\text{dRP}$ flap.\n\nTherefore, the correct set is in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1471566"}]}
