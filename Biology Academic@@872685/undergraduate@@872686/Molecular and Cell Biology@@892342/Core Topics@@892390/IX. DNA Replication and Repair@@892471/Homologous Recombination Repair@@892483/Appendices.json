This practice explores the critical role of homologous recombination in ensuring cell survival after DNA damage. By comparing a wild-type bacterium to one lacking the essential RecA protein, you will reason through the consequences of a failed HR pathway and its relationship to other repair systems [@problem_id:2318890].", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a researcher investigates the DNA repair mechanisms in *Escherichia coli*. The focus of the study is the bacterium's response to Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is known to cause DNA lesions, primarily thymine dimers. The researcher compares two strains: a wild-type (WT) strain, which has all its DNA repair systems intact, and a mutant strain, `recA-`, which lacks a functional RecA protein. The RecA protein is essential for initiating Homologous Recombination (HR) repair, a pathway critical for repairing double-strand breaks that can arise when a replication fork collapses at an unrepaired DNA lesion. Both strains possess a fully functional Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) system, which is the primary pathway for directly removing thymine dimers.\n\nIn the experiment, liquid cultures of both the WT and `recA-` strains are grown to the same cell density. Samples from each culture are then spread onto nutrient agar plates. One set of plates for each strain is exposed to a short, controlled dose of UV light, while a control set is not exposed. After incubation, the number of colonies is counted. The survival fraction is calculated as the ratio of the number of colonies on the UV-exposed plate to the number of colonies on the unexposed control plate.\n\nFor the wild-type (WT) strain, the experiment yields a survival fraction of 0.90 after UV exposure. Based on your understanding of the roles of NER and HR in DNA repair, which of the following values is the most plausible prediction for the survival fraction of the `recA-` mutant strain under the same experimental conditions?\n\nA. 0.90\n\nB. 1.00\n\nC. 0.01\n\nD. 0.50\n\nE. 0.80", "solution": "Define the survival fraction for a given strain as $S=\\frac{N_{\\text{UV}}}{N_{\\text{control}}}$, where $N_{\\text{UV}}$ is the number of colonies after UV exposure and $N_{\\text{control}}$ is the number without UV. The wild-type (WT) strain yields $S_{\\text{WT}}=0.90$, indicating that, at the applied UV dose, most cells survive due to effective DNA repair.\n\nRelevant biological principles:\n- UV causes primarily thymine dimers, which block replication. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) directly removes thymine dimers. Both strains have functional NER.\n- When a replication fork encounters an unrepaired lesion, it can stall and collapse, creating a double-strand break. Repair and restart of such events require homologous recombination (HR).\n- RecA is essential for HR initiation and for activating the SOS response, which upregulates many DNA repair functions, including increased expression of NER components and translesion synthesis polymerases. A recA-deficient (recA-) strain therefore lacks HR and cannot induce the SOS regulon; it relies only on basal NER and cannot efficiently recover collapsed forks.\n\nLogical implications for survival:\n- Even with NER present, some thymine dimers persist into replication, causing fork collapse. In WT, HR repairs these collapses, substantially reducing lethality. In recA-, these events are largely lethal because HR is absent and SOS induction does not occur.\n- Therefore, under the same UV dose that yields $S_{\\text{WT}}=0.90$, the recA- mutant is expected to be dramatically more UV sensitive, with survival orders of magnitude lower than WT, not a modest decrement.\n- Option-by-option evaluation:\n  - A (0.90): Implies no dependence on HR; contradicts the essential role of RecA in rescuing fork collapse and inducing SOS; implausible.\n  - B (1.00): Implies no killing by UV; incompatible with the known lethality of UV and with the WT result.\n  - E (0.80) and D (0.50): Represent small to moderate reductions; these underestimate the marked UV hypersensitivity of recA- strains lacking HR and SOS induction.\n  - C (0.01): Reflects an orders-of-magnitude reduction in survival consistent with severe UV sensitivity when HR and SOS induction are absent despite basal NER.\n\nThus, the most plausible prediction among the given choices is a very low survival fraction for the recA- mutant, best represented by 0.01.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2318890"}, {"introduction": "Homologous recombination is a high-fidelity repair mechanism, but its outcome is not always genetically neutral. After DNA replication, a cell must choose between its identical sister chromatid and its potentially different homologous chromosome as a repair template. This thought experiment asks you to evaluate the genetic risks of that choice, introducing the crucial concept of loss of heterozygosity that arises when non-identical sequences are used for repair [@problem_id:2318863].", "problem": "In a diploid eukaryotic organism, a DNA double-strand break (DSB) can be repaired via the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. After the S phase of the cell cycle, the cell has two potential templates for this repair: the newly replicated and identical sister chromatid, or the homologous chromosome inherited from the other parent.\n\nHomologous chromosomes carry the same set of genes, but they may possess different versions of these genes, known as alleles. An organism is said to be heterozygous for a particular gene if it has two different alleles at that locus.\n\nConsidering a DSB that occurs within a gene for which the organism is heterozygous, what is the primary genetic risk of the cell's repair machinery using the homologous chromosome as a template instead of the sister chromatid?\n\nA. The homologous chromosome may carry different alleles, and using it as a template can lead to a loss of heterozygosity at the repair site.\n\nB. The repair enzymes used for inter-homolog recombination are inherently more error-prone than those used for sister chromatid recombination.\n\nC. Homologous chromosomes are physically located further away, increasing the chance of chromosomal translocations during the search for a template.\n\nD. The base-pairing fidelity between non-identical homologous sequences is significantly lower, leading to the introduction of numerous point mutations during the repair synthesis.\n\nE. The chromatin of the homologous chromosome is generally more condensed and inaccessible, forcing the cell to use a riskier, alternative repair pathway.", "solution": "We identify the relevant biological mechanism: homologous recombination (HR) repairs a DNA double-strand break (DSB) by using an undamaged homologous DNA sequence as a template for DNA synthesis. After S phase, the sister chromatid provides a template that is effectively identical to the broken chromatid, minimizing the chance of altering allelic information. In contrast, a homologous chromosome carries the same loci but may contain different alleles at heterozygous sites.\n\nWhen the DSB occurs within a gene for which the organism is heterozygous, using the homologous chromosome as the template can cause gene conversion. Mechanistically, strand invasion and repair synthesis can copy the sequence from the homolog across the broken region, forming heteroduplex DNA with potential mismatches where alleles differ. Mismatch repair then resolves these mismatches, often converting one allele to match the template. The net genetic consequence at the repaired site is loss of heterozygosity (LOH), producing homozygosity for the allele present on the homolog.\n\nWe evaluate the options against established principles of HR fidelity and genome stability:\n- A correctly states the principal risk: template choice of the homolog can cause gene conversion and LOH at the repaired locus.\n- B is incorrect because the HR machinery (Rad51-dependent strand invasion, high-fidelity DNA polymerases) does not differ in intrinsic error rate between inter-sister and inter-homolog recombination; both are high-fidelity processes.\n- C is not the primary risk in HR; while spatial proximity favors sister chromatid usage, HR’s homology dependence strongly suppresses translocations compared to non-homologous end joining. Increased distance is not the primary genetic risk relative to LOH.\n- D is incorrect because base-pairing during HR remains highly specific; heteroduplex mismatches reflect allelic differences rather than low fidelity, and repair does not introduce numerous point mutations.\n- E is incorrect because there is no general rule that the homolog’s chromatin is more condensed in a way that forces a riskier pathway; accessibility may vary by locus and phase but does not constitute the primary genetic risk here.\n\nTherefore, the primary genetic risk of using the homologous chromosome as template at a heterozygous locus is loss of heterozygosity due to gene conversion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2318863"}, {"introduction": "Understanding biological pathways also requires measuring them, and scientists have developed clever tools to do so. This problem introduces a classic reporter gene assay, a powerful technique used to quantify the frequency of homologous recombination events inside living cells. By working through this experimental scenario, you will apply your knowledge to calculate the efficiency of repair, gaining insight into how molecular processes are studied quantitatively in the lab [@problem_id:2318889].", "problem": "A team of researchers is studying the efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms in a specific line of cultured human cells. They have engineered a stable cell line where each cell contains a single, integrated copy of a reporter construct called `pBFP-STOP`. This construct includes a strong constitutive promoter driving the expression of a gene for Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP), but the BFP coding sequence has been intentionally mutated to contain a premature stop codon. This mutation renders the expressed protein non-functional, and thus the cells do not exhibit blue fluorescence.\n\nTo measure the rate of Homologous Recombination (HR), the researchers transfect these cells with two components:\n1. A plasmid expressing a highly specific nuclease that induces a double-strand break (DSB) precisely at the site of the premature stop codon within the BFP gene.\n2. A linear, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide that serves as a repair template. This template is 120 nucleotides long and is perfectly homologous to the BFP gene sequence, but it contains the correct codon instead of the premature stop codon. The template itself has no promoter and cannot be independently expressed.\n\nIf a cell successfully repairs the DSB using the provided template via homologous recombination, the BFP gene's correct sequence is restored, leading to the production of functional BFP and causing the cell to become fluorescent. Any other repair pathway, such as non-homologous end joining, will not restore the BFP function.\n\nThe experiment begins with a culture containing $2.50 \\times 10^6$ cells. Following transfection, the cells are incubated for 72 hours. An independent assay determines that the transfection efficiency for this procedure is 45.0%, meaning only this fraction of the cells successfully internalizes both the nuclease plasmid and the repair template. After the incubation period, the entire cell population is analyzed by a cell sorter, which counts a total of $14,175$ blue fluorescent cells.\n\nAssuming that a successful HR repair event can only occur in a successfully transfected cell, calculate the frequency of HR-mediated repair per transfected cell.
