By considering this scenario, you will solidify the foundational principle that all regulatory mechanisms are downstream of, and dependent upon, a viable promoter.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying the regulation of gene expression in *Escherichia coli*. A specific mutant strain has been isolated which contains a mutation in the promoter of the *lac* operon, designated as `Plac-`. This mutation completely prevents the binding of the enzyme Ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase to the promoter region. All other components of the *lac* operon system, including the operator (`O`), the CAP-binding site, the repressor gene (`lacI`), and the structural genes (`lacZ`, `lacY`, `lacA`), are fully functional and wild-type.\n\nAssuming the cell has a functional transport system for both glucose and lactose, predict the level of expression of the `lacZ` gene product, $\\beta$-galactosidase, in this `Plac-` mutant strain under any and all environmental conditions (i.e., regardless of the presence or absence of glucose and lactose in the growth medium).\n\nChoose the most accurate description from the options below.\n\nA.

This practice problem [@problem_id:2335663] presents a mutant where the negative control, the LacI repressor, is disabled. This scenario forces you to isolate the effect of the positive control system (catabolite activation by CAP), clarifying how the absence of repression does not automatically lead to maximum gene expression.", "problem": "The `lac` operon in *Escherichia coli* is a well-studied system for understanding gene regulation. Its expression allows the bacterium to metabolize lactose. The operon's transcription is primarily controlled by two inputs: the presence of lactose and the presence of glucose.\n\nThe `lacI` gene, located separately from the operon, codes for a repressor protein. In the absence of lactose, this repressor binds to a DNA sequence called the operator, physically blocking transcription of the operon's structural genes, such as `lacZ` (which codes for the enzyme $\\beta$-galactosidase).\n\nA second level of control, known as catabolite repression, is mediated by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). In a cellular environment with low glucose, intracellular levels of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) are high. The cAMP-CAP complex binds to a site near the promoter, significantly enhancing the binding of RNA polymerase and leading to high levels of transcription. Conversely, high glucose levels lead to low cAMP levels, leaving CAP inactive.\n\nConsider an experiment involving a special mutant strain of *E. coli*. This strain has a loss-of-function mutation in the `lacI` gene, denoted as `lacI-`. This mutation leads to the continuous production of a non-functional repressor protein that cannot bind to the operator. This `lacI-` mutant strain is cultured in a growth medium that contains an abundant supply of glucose but is completely devoid of lactose.\n\nBased on your understanding of the `lac` operon's regulatory mechanisms, predict the level of `lacZ` gene expression in this `lacI-` mutant strain under these specific growth conditions.\n\nA. No expression will occur.\n\nB. High\n\nC. A low, basal level of expression will occur.\n\nD. The expression level will be identical to a wild-type strain under the same conditions.\n\nE. Expression will remain repressed until lactose is added to the medium.", "solution": "The lac operon is subject to two controls: negative regulation by the LacI repressor at the operator and positive regulation by the cAMP–CAP complex at the promoter-proximal activator site. In wild-type cells without lactose, functional LacI binds the operator, preventing RNA polymerase progression and thereby repressing transcription of lacZ; in contrast, when lactose (converted to allolactose) is present, it inactivates the repressor, allowing transcription. Independently, when glucose is low, cAMP is high and binds CAP; the cAMP–CAP complex enhances RNA polymerase binding, leading to high transcription. When glucose is high, cAMP is low, CAP is inactive, and positive activation is absent, reducing transcription to basal levels determined by the intrinsic promoter strength.\n\nIn the lacI− mutant, the repressor is nonfunctional and cannot bind the operator. Therefore, the negative control is abolished and repression does not occur regardless of lactose presence. Under the stated conditions (abundant glucose, no lactose), the absence of a functional repressor means the operon is not blocked; however, abundant glucose keeps cAMP levels low, CAP remains inactive, and the positive activation that yields high transcription is absent. Thus, transcription from the lac promoter proceeds only at its weak, basal level dictated by RNA polymerase’s intrinsic affinity for the promoter.\n\nTherefore: \n- Not zero expression, because there is no repressor-mediated blockade.\n- Not high expression, because CAP is inactive under high glucose.\n- Not identical to wild type under the same conditions, because wild type would be repressed without lactose.\n- Not awaiting lactose induction, because the repressor is nonfunctional.\n\nThe correct prediction is a low, basal level of lacZ expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335663"}, {"introduction": "Molecular geneticists distinguish between mutations in regulatory proteins and mutations in the DNA sequences they bind to using classic complementation tests. This exercise [@problem_id:2335677] delves into this powerful experimental logic, asking you to contrast the behavior of a faulty repressor protein with that of a faulty operator site in a partial diploid cell. Mastering this distinction between *trans*-acting factors and *cis*-acting elements is essential for interpreting genetic experiments and understanding the architecture of any gene regulatory network.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the *lac* operon is a classic system for gene regulation. It consists of three structural genes (`lacZ`, `lacY`, `lacA`) that are transcribed together from a single promoter. The expression of these genes is controlled by a regulatory gene, `lacI`, which codes for a repressor protein, and a DNA sequence called the operator, `lacO`, to which the repressor protein binds.\n\nConsider two different mutant strains of *E. coli* that both exhibit constitutive expression of the *lac* operon, meaning the structural genes are expressed continuously, regardless of the presence or absence of lactose.\n\n*   **Strain 1:** Has a mutation in the `lacI` gene, denoted `lacI-`, which results in a non-functional repressor protein that cannot bind to the operator.\n*   **Strain 2:** Has a mutation in the operator DNA sequence, denoted `lacOc` (for operator constitutive), which prevents the wild-type repressor protein from binding to it.\n\nA classic experiment to differentiate the nature of these mutations involves creating a partial diploid, or merodiploid, by introducing a plasmid (an F' factor) carrying a wild-type copy of the regulatory region (`lacI+` and `lacO+`) into each mutant strain.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly distinguishes the molecular basis of constitutive expression in these two original mutant strains when tested in a merodiploid context?\n\nA. Both mutations are cis-acting, meaning the introduction of a wild-type allele on a plasmid cannot restore normal, inducible regulation in either strain.\n\nB. Both mutations are trans-acting, meaning the introduction of a wild-type allele on a plasmid will restore normal, inducible regulation in both strains.\n\nC. The `lacI-` mutation is recessive to the wild-type `lacI+` allele, and its effect can be complemented in trans, restoring normal regulation in a merodiploid. The `lacOc` mutation is cis-dominant, and its effect cannot be complemented, leading to continued constitutive expression from the operon it controls.\n\nD. The `lacOc` mutation is recessive to the wild-type `lacO+` allele, and its effect can be complemented in trans, restoring normal regulation in a merodiploid. The `lacI-` mutation is cis-dominant, and its effect cannot be complemented.\n\nE. The introduction of a wild-type allele normalizes the response to glucose levels for both strains, but only restores lactose-inducible expression in the `lacI-` mutant.", "solution": "The lac operon is controlled by a repressor protein encoded by lacI and a cis-acting operator DNA site lacO. A trans-acting factor is a diffusible product (such as a protein) that can act on multiple DNA molecules in the same cell, whereas a cis-acting element is a DNA sequence whose effect is restricted to the physically linked genes on the same DNA molecule.\n\nFor Strain 1 (lacI−), the mutation in lacI abolishes functional repressor production. Because lacI encodes a diffusible protein, the phenotype caused by lacI− is trans-acting and recessive to lacI+. In a merodiploid carrying lacI+ on an F' plasmid, the functional repressor is produced and can diffuse to bind any wild-type operator present, restoring inducible regulation of operons with a functional operator. Therefore, lacI− is complemented in trans by lacI+ and is recessive.\n\nFor Strain 2 (lacOc), the operator sequence itself is altered so that the repressor cannot bind. The operator is a cis-acting DNA element: its mutation affects only the linked operon on the same DNA molecule and cannot be rescued by providing a wild-type operator sequence elsewhere. Even if a lacI+ gene on the plasmid produces functional repressor, it cannot bind the mutant lacOc site; hence the operon linked to lacOc remains constitutively expressed. Thus, lacOc is cis-dominant and not complemented in trans.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\n- A is incorrect because lacI− is trans-acting and can be complemented by lacI+.\n- B is incorrect because lacOc is not trans-acting; it is cis-acting and cannot be complemented.\n- C correctly states that lacI− is recessive and complemented in trans, while lacOc is cis-dominant and not complemented.\n- D is incorrect because it reverses the dominance and cis/trans properties.\n- E is incorrect because it introduces glucose regulation, which is not the distinguishing factor in this complementation test.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335677"}]}
