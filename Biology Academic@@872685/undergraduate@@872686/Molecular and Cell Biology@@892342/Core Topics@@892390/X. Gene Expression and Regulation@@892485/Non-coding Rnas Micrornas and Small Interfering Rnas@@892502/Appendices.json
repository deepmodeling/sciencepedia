Not appropriate for direct mRNA quantification.\n- Southern Blotting detects specific DNA sequences; it is designed for genomic DNA, not mRNA. Not applicable for mRNA measurement.\n- Flow Cytometry quantifies cellular fluorescence, typically from labeled antibodies or reporters; it generally reports protein levels or cell phenotypes, not native mRNA abundance. It is not a direct mRNA assay in this context.\n- Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) converts mRNA to cDNA via reverse transcription and then quantifies the cDNA by real-time PCR. The cycle threshold values allow quantitative comparison of mRNA abundance between samples, typically analyzed using the $\\Delta \\Delta C_{t}$ method to obtain relative fold change as $2^{-\\Delta \\Delta C_{t}}$.
