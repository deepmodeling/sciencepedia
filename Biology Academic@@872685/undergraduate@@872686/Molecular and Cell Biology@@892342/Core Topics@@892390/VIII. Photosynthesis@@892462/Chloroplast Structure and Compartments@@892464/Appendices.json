The leaves are first homogenized in a cold, isotonic buffer solution to create a \"homogenate\". This process breaks the cell walls and plasma membranes, releasing the organelles into the buffer. The resulting homogenate contains a mixture of unbroken cells, large cell wall fragments, nuclei, chloroplasts, mitochondria, fragments of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (which form small vesicles called microsomes), ribosomes, and soluble cytosolic proteins. The student plans to use a series of differential centrifugation steps to obtain a pellet fraction that is enriched with intact chloroplasts.\n\nGiven the relative size and density of the subcellular components (Nuclei > Chloroplasts > Mitochondria > Microsomes > Ribosomes), which of the following protocols is the most appropriate and effective for obtaining a fraction enriched with intact chloroplasts?\n\nA.

The sedimentation velocity of a particle in the Stokes regime is given by\n$$\nv=\\frac{2 r^{2}(\\rho_{p}-\\rho_{m}) \\omega^{2} R}{9 \\eta},\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the particle radius, $\\rho_{p}$ is particle density, $\\rho_{m}$ is medium density, $\\omega$ is angular velocity, $R$ is the radial distance, and $\\eta$ is the viscosity. Thus, larger and denser components sediment at lower relative centrifugal force (RCF), while smaller and less dense components require higher RCF and/or longer time.\n\nGiven the order of sizes and densities $($Nuclei $>$ Chloroplasts $>$ Mitochondria $>$ Microsomes $>$ Ribosomes$)$, the correct differential centrifugation strategy is:\n1. Use a low-speed spin to pellet the largest components (unbroken cells, cell wall fragments, and nuclei). Chloroplasts should remain in the supernatant at this step to avoid co-pelleting with nuclei.\n2. Use a subsequent medium-speed spin on the supernatant to pellet chloroplasts. Smaller components like mitochondria, microsomes, ribosomes, and soluble proteins will remain in the supernatant.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A: Centrifuge at $600 \\times g$ for $10$ minutes to remove nuclei and debris into the pellet; collect the supernatant and centrifuge at $3{,}000 \\times g$ for $15$ minutes to pellet chloroplasts. This matches the standard protocol: first remove nuclei at low RCF, then pellet chloroplasts at moderate RCF. The resulting pellet is enriched in intact chloroplasts. This is appropriate and effective.\n- Option B: Centrifuge at $3{,}000 \\times g$ for $15$ minutes and take the supernatant as enriched chloroplasts. This is incorrect because chloroplasts pellet at this RCF; the supernatant would be depleted of chloroplasts and enriched in smaller components.\n- Option C: Centrifuge at $100{,}000 \\times g$ for $60$ minutes and take the pellet. This very high RCF pellets microsomes and ribosomes in addition to larger organelles, producing a mixed pellet, not specifically enriched in intact chloroplasts, and risks damaging them.\n- Option D: Centrifuge at $600 \\times g$ for $10$ minutes and take the pellet. This pellets nuclei and debris, not chloroplasts; it is not an enriched chloroplast fraction.\n- Option E: Centrifuge first at $3{,}000 \\times g$ to pellet chloroplasts together with nuclei and debris, then resuspend and spin at $600 \\times g$ to re-pellet nuclei, taking the supernatant as chloroplasts. Although the second step would remove nuclei, the initial high-speed step co-pellets chloroplasts with nuclei and debris, risking contamination and reduced yield; it is less appropriate and less efficient than first removing nuclei at low RCF. The standard, most effective strategy is to remove nuclei before pelleting chloroplasts.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate and effective protocol is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2308754"}, {"introduction": "This problem presents a classic thought experiment that was instrumental in proving Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory. It elegantly demonstrates that the direct energy source for ATP synthesis is a proton gradient, or proton motive force, across the thylakoid membrane.

A researcher isolates intact thylakoids from plant cells and performs a two-step procedure in complete darkness.\n\nFirst, the isolated thylakoids are suspended in an acidic buffer solution with a pH of 4.0. They are incubated long enough for the pH inside the thylakoid lumen to equilibrate with the surrounding buffer.\n\nSecond, the thylakoids are rapidly transferred from the pH 4.0 buffer to a new, larger volume of a basic buffer solution with a pH of 8.0. This second solution also contains an abundance of Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\nAssuming the thylakoid membranes are functionally intact and impermeable to protons except through ATP synthase complexes, which one of the following molecules would be produced in significant amounts in the basic buffer solution immediately following the transfer?\n\nA.
