{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly grasp the efficiency of photosynthesis, we can start by asking a fundamental question: what is the minimum energy input required to produce a key output? This practice problem invites you to perform a basic \"accounting\" of the photons needed to create one molecule of NADPH, the primary reducing agent generated by the light reactions. By tracing the path of electrons through both photosystems under the idealized assumption of perfect efficiency, you will solidify your understanding of the core stoichiometry of linear electron flow [@problem_id:2330160].", "problem": "In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, energy from sunlight is used to generate high-energy molecules. This process occurs via a pathway known as linear electron flow, which involves two large protein-pigment complexes: Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI).\n\nConsider the following simplified model of this process:\n1.  An electron in the reaction center of PSII (known as P680) is excited upon the absorption of a single photon. This high-energy electron is then passed to an electron transport chain.\n2.  The electron deficiency in PSII is replenished by electrons obtained from the splitting of water.\n3.  The electron travels along an electron transport chain from PSII and eventually reaches the reaction center of PSI (known as P700).\n4.  This electron is then re-energized by the absorption of a second single photon at PSI, which excites it to an even higher energy level.\n5.  This high-energy electron from PSI is ultimately used to reduce Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ($NADP^+$). The formation of one molecule of its reduced form, NADPH, requires the delivery of two electrons and a proton, according to the reaction: \n$$NADP^+ + H^+ + 2 e^- \\rightarrow NADPH$$\n\nAssuming perfect quantum efficiency, where every absorbed photon successfully results in the excitation and transfer of one electron, what is the minimum total number of photons that must be absorbed collectively by PSII and PSI to produce a single molecule of NADPH?", "solution": "We map photons absorbed to electrons transferred under the stated perfect quantum efficiency: each absorbed photon excites and transfers one electron.\n\nIn linear electron flow, each electron that ultimately reduces $NADP^{+}$ is excited twice: once at PSII (P680) and once at PSI (P700). Therefore, the photon requirement per electron is:\n$$ n_{\\gamma \\text{ per } e^{-}} = 1 \\text{ (at PSII)} + 1 \\text{ (at PSI)} = 2. $$\nThe reduction stoichiometry for NADPH formation is given by:\n$$ NADP^{+} + H^{+} + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow NADPH, $$\nwhich shows that:\n$$ n_{e^{-} \\text{ per NADPH}} = 2. $$\nCombining these factors, the total photons required per NADPH are:\n$$ n_{\\gamma \\text{ per NADPH}} = \\left(n_{\\gamma \\text{ per } e^{-}}\\right)\\left(n_{e^{-} \\text{ per NADPH}}\\right) = 2 \\times 2 = 4. $$\nThus, the minimum total number of photons collectively absorbed by PSII and PSI to produce one NADPH is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2330160"}, {"introduction": "The flow of electrons from water to $NADP^+$ does more than just produce NADPH; it also powers the creation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is essential for ATP synthesis. This exercise challenges you to quantify the total number of protons pumped into the thylakoid lumen for every molecule of oxygen evolved. This calculation highlights the dual function of the electron transport chain and its central role in generating the chemiosmotic potential that drives ATP synthase [@problem_id:2062494].", "problem": "In the thylakoids of chloroplasts, the process of non-cyclic electron transport, also known as the Z-scheme, harnesses light energy to produce ATP and NADPH. This pathway begins with the light-induced oxidation of water at Photosystem II (PSII), which releases electrons, protons, and diatomic oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$). These electrons are then passed through a series of carriers, including the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex, to Photosystem I (PSI), and ultimately used to reduce $NADP^+$ to NADPH.\n\nDuring this process, a proton gradient is established across the thylakoid membrane, with protons accumulating in the thylakoid lumen. This accumulation occurs through two primary mechanisms:\n1. The oxidation of water by the oxygen-evolving complex associated with PSII.\n2. The transport of protons from the stroma to the lumen by the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex, which operates via a mechanism known as the Q-cycle. For the purpose of this problem, assume that the Q-cycle translocates exactly four protons into the lumen for every two electrons that pass through the complex.\n\nConsidering the complete, non-cyclic electron transport pathway from the splitting of water to the eventual reduction of $NADP^+$, calculate the total number of protons that accumulate in the thylakoid lumen for each molecule of diatomic oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) produced.", "solution": "The light-driven oxidation of water at PSII produces, per molecule of diatomic oxygen formed, the reaction:\n$$2\\,\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{O}_2 + 4\\,\\text{H}^+_{\\text{lumen}} + 4\\,e^{-}.$$\nThus, for each $\\text{O}_2$ produced, $4$ protons are released directly into the thylakoid lumen and $4$ electrons enter the electron transport chain.\n\nThese $4$ electrons pass through the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex. By the given assumption for the Q-cycle, for every $2$ electrons, $4$ protons are translocated from the stroma to the lumen.

This thought experiment models the real-world action of many common herbicides, which target specific components of the photosynthetic machinery. By analyzing the immediate effects of blocking electron transfer from Photosystem II in this hypothetical scenario, you will reinforce your knowledge of the sequential and interdependent nature of the entire Z-scheme [@problem_id:2330117].", "problem": "A team of agricultural scientists is developing a new herbicide, designated \"Herboxin,\" designed to be highly effective against a specific invasive weed species. Laboratory analysis reveals that Herboxin's primary mode of action is to bind with high affinity and specificity to the binding site for mobile plastoquinone ($Q_B$ site) on the D1 protein of Photosystem II (PSII). This binding event physically obstructs plastoquinone (PQ) molecules from docking with and accepting electrons from PSII.\n\nTo test its effect, an experiment is set up using isolated and fully functional chloroplasts from the target weed. The chloroplasts are suspended in an isotonic buffer solution containing adequate amounts of water, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ($NADP^+$). The suspension is illuminated with an appropriate continuous light source that efficiently excites both PSII and Photosystem I (PSI), leading to a steady rate of photosynthesis. After this steady state is achieved, a dose of Herboxin sufficient to block all PSII centers is added to the chloroplast suspension.\n\nAssuming no alternative electron transport pathways (like cyclic electron flow) are immediately activated, which of the following options best describes the immediate effects on the net rates of molecular oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) evolution and NADPH synthesis after the addition of Herboxin?\n\nA.
