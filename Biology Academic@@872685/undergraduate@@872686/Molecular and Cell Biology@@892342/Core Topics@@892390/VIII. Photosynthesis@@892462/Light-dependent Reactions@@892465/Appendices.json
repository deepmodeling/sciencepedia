This first exercise focuses on the critical water-splitting reaction at Photosystem II, asking you to determine the fundamental stoichiometry that links water oxidation to the production of molecular oxygen. Understanding this relationship is the first step to tracking the flow of energy and matter through photosynthesis. [@problem_id:2321285]", "problem": "In the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, the process of photosynthesis begins with the light-dependent reactions. A key event in these reactions is the photolysis of water, which occurs at a protein complex known as Photosystem II (PSII). This reaction is crucial as it generates protons that contribute to a chemiosmotic gradient and supplies electrons to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The primary waste product of this water-splitting reaction is diatomic oxygen ($O_2$). Considering the complete oxidation of water to form oxygen, determine the total number of electrons that must be extracted from water molecules to produce a single molecule of diatomic oxygen ($O_2$).", "solution": "We seek the number of electrons removed when water is oxidized to form one molecule of diatomic oxygen. Oxidation numbers show that oxygen in water has oxidation state $-2$, while in $O_2$ it is $0$. The change in oxidation number per oxygen atom is $(-2) \\rightarrow 0$, which corresponds to a loss of $2$ electrons per oxygen atom. Since one molecule of $O_2$ contains two oxygen atoms, the total electrons lost is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nThis is confirmed by writing and balancing the oxidation half-reaction in acidic medium:\n$$2H_2O \\rightarrow O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^-.$$\nAtoms and charge are balanced, and the coefficient of $e^-$ shows that producing one $O_2$ requires extracting $4$ electrons from water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2321285"}, {"introduction": "Once electrons are liberated from water, they embark on a journey through the electron transport chain, driving the active transport of protons into the thylakoid lumen. This practice requires you to tally the total number of protons accumulated for each pair of electrons that completes the linear pathway, accounting for contributions from both water photolysis and the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex. This calculation is key to quantifying the proton motive force that will ultimately power ATP synthesis. [@problem_id:2055610]", "problem": "In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, a process known as linear electron flow (or non-cyclic photophosphorylation) establishes a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This gradient is subsequently used to synthesize ATP. The pathway involves the transfer of electrons from water molecules through a series of protein complexes embedded in the membrane.\n\nConsider the journey of a single pair of electrons. These two electrons are liberated by the oxidation of one molecule of water at the oxygen-evolving complex associated with Photosystem II (PSII), a reaction that also releases protons directly into the thylakoid lumen. The electrons are then passed along an electron transport chain to the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex. This complex utilizes the energy from the electron transfer to actively pump protons from the chloroplast stroma into the thylakoid lumen. Following this, the electrons are transferred via plastocyanin to Photosystem I (PSI). After being re-energized by light at PSI, the electrons are used to reduce one molecule of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate ($NADP^+$) to NADPH in the stroma.\n\nBased on the standard stoichiometric model for this process, determine the total number of protons that are moved into the thylakoid lumen for every two electrons transferred from water to NADPH.", "solution": "We track protons moved into the thylakoid lumen per transfer of two electrons from water to $NADP^+$ under linear electron flow.\n\n1) Protons released into the lumen at PSII during water oxidation:\nThe oxygen-evolving complex performs\n$$\n2 H_{2}O \\rightarrow O_{2} + 4 H^{+}_{\\text{lumen}} + 4 e^{-}.\n$$\nPer two electrons, this scales to\n$$\nH_{2}O \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}O_{2} + 2 H^{+}_{\\text{lumen}} + 2 e^{-},\n$$\ncontributing $2$ protons to the lumen.\n\n2) Proton translocation via the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex (Q cycle):\nTwo electrons from PSII reduce plastoquinone to plastoquinol at the stromal side of PSII,\n$$\n\\text{PQ} + 2 e^{-} + 2 H^{+}_{\\text{stroma}} \\rightarrow \\text{PQH}_{2}.\n$$\nCytochrome $b_6f$ then oxidizes $\\text{PQH}_{2}$ and, via the Q cycle, moves protons into the lumen.
