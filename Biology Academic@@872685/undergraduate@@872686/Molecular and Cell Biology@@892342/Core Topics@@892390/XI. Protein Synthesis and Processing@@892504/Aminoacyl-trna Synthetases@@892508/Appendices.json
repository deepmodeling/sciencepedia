This thought experiment probes the division of labor between the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and the ribosome by asking a critical question: which enzyme has the final say on which amino acid is added to a growing protein? Understanding this principle, often called the \"second genetic code,\" is fundamental to grasping the logic of translation [@problem_id:2030990].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment aiming to investigate the specificity of the translational machinery, a researcher modifies the gene for an alanine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), denoted as `tRNA^Ala`. The modification is highly specific: the nucleotide triplet in the anticodon loop of `tRNA^Ala` is altered to become the anticodon for the amino acid cysteine. This engineered tRNA is then introduced into a cell-free in vitro translation system, which is fully equipped for protein synthesis. The system contains functional ribosomes, a pool of all 20 standard amino acids (including alanine and cysteine), all necessary enzymatic factors, a complete set of functional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and a synthetic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) template that includes multiple codons for cysteine.\n\nIt is given that the modification of the anticodon does not significantly alter the overall three-dimensional structure of the tRNA molecule, allowing its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to still recognize and charge it with an amino acid. Which amino acid will be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain when the ribosome encounters a cysteine codon on the mRNA template?\n\nA. Cysteine\n\nB. Alanine\n\nC. Methionine\n\nD. No amino acid will be incorporated, causing translation to stall.\n\nE. Both Cysteine and Alanine, with equal probability.", "solution": "Key principle: Translational fidelity is enforced primarily at the aminoacylation step by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which recognize identity elements in the tRNA and attach the corresponding amino acid. The ribosome monitors codon-anticodon pairing but does not verify the amino acid attached to the tRNA.\n\nApply to the scenario:\n1. The engineered tRNA is derived from tRNA^{Ala} but has its anticodon altered to pair with a cysteine codon. It is given that this change does not disrupt the tRNA identity elements or overall structure required for recognition by its cognate alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS).\n2. Therefore, AlaRS will charge this modified tRNA with alanine, not cysteine, because aaRS recognition depends on tRNA identity elements (often in the acceptor stem and elsewhere), not solely on the anticodon.\n3. In the ribosome, when a cysteine codon appears in the A site, the modified tRNA with the cysteine-recognizing anticodon will base-pair correctly with that codon and be accepted.\n4. The ribosome will incorporate the amino acid attached to this tRNA into the growing polypeptide. Because the tRNA was charged by AlaRS, the attached amino acid is alanine.\n5. Thus, alanine is incorporated at positions specified by cysteine codons. Translation does not stall, and cysteine is not incorporated, because the ribosome does not check the amino acid.\n\nConclusion: The amino acid incorporated is alanine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2030990"}, {"introduction": "While synthetases are highly specific, they are not perfect, especially when faced with amino acids that are structurally very similar, like isoleucine and valine. To combat this, many synthetases have evolved a \"proofreading\" or editing function to correct their own mistakes. This practice explores the consequences of losing this crucial quality-control mechanism, highlighting its importance in preventing widespread errors in protein synthesis [@problem_id:2303560].", "problem": "The fidelity of protein synthesis is critically dependent on the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), enzymes that catalyze the attachment of a specific amino acid to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA). This process is called tRNA charging. Some aaRS enzymes possess a hydrolytic editing domain that acts as a proofreading mechanism to remove incorrectly attached amino acids.\n\nA well-studied example is isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), which is responsible for charging isoleucine (Ile) onto its cognate tRNA, tRNA^Ile. Due to the high structural similarity between isoleucine and valine (Val), IleRS occasionally binds valine by mistake in its activation site.\n\nConsider a bacterial strain with a mutation that renders the hydrolytic editing domain of its IleRS enzyme completely non-functional. However, the domains responsible for amino acid activation and tRNA charging remain fully active. What is the most likely consequence of this mutation on proteins synthesized within these bacterial cells?\n\nA. Valine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where isoleucine is specified by the genetic code.\n\nB. Isoleucine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where valine is specified by the genetic code.\n\nC. Protein synthesis will be significantly reduced or halted because tRNA^Ile cannot be properly charged.\n\nD. The ribosome will reject the incorrectly charged tRNA^Ile, preventing any errors in the final protein sequence.\n\nE. Leucine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where isoleucine is specified by the genetic code.", "solution": "Principles:\n- Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) determine the amino acid identity attached to a given tRNA; the ribosome selects tRNAs based on codon-anticodon pairing, not by verifying the attached amino acid.\n- IleRS normally activates isoleucine but can misactivate valine due to structural similarity. An editing (hydrolytic) domain proofreads by hydrolyzing misactivated valine or mischarged valyl-tRNA to prevent errors.\n- If the editing domain is non-functional while activation and charging remain intact, mischarged tRNAs will accumulate.\n\nMechanism:\n1. Normal charging reaction (intended):\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ile} + \\mathrm{ATP} + \\mathrm{tRNA}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{IleRS}} \\mathrm{Ile\\mbox{-}tRNA}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} + \\mathrm{AMP} + \\mathrm{PP}_{\\mathrm{i}}.\n$$\n2.

In the mutant lacking hydrolytic editing, step 3 fails.

It is not enough to know that proofreading is important; this practice challenges you to calculate precisely *how* important it is by using discrimination factors to quantify its contribution to the overall fidelity of translation. This demonstrates how molecular biologists can measure and appreciate the remarkable power of these error-correction systems [@problem_id:1468604].", "problem": "The fidelity of protein synthesis depends critically on the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), enzymes that charge transfer RNAs (tRNAs) with their corresponding amino acids. The overall fidelity of an aaRS is often achieved through a two-step mechanism: an initial discrimination at the aminoacylation (synthesis) site and a subsequent proofreading step at a separate editing site.\n\nConsider the case of Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), which must distinguish its cognate amino acid, isoleucine (Ile), from the structurally similar non-cognate amino acid, valine (Val). In a wild-type cell, the synthesis site of IleRS exhibits a discrimination factor of 100, meaning it preferentially binds isoleucine over valine by a factor of 100. After the amino acid is attached to the tRNA, any incorrectly formed Val-tRNA^Ile is subjected to proofreading. The editing site of the wild-type IleRS has a discrimination factor of 250, meaning it is 250 times more likely to recognize and hydrolyze an incorrect Val-tRNA^Ile than to release it intact.\n\nNow, imagine a scenario where a genetic mutation results in the complete deletion of the IleRS editing domain, rendering the proofreading step entirely non-functional. The synthesis site remains unaffected by this mutation. By what factor does the rate of valine misincorporation at isoleucine codons increase in cells expressing only this mutant IleRS compared to cells with the wild-type enzyme?

Thus the escaping (released) fraction of incorrect product, relative to the case with no editing, is reduced by a factor $D_{e}$, so the surviving fraction is\n$$\nf_{\\text{survive}}=\\frac{1}{D_{e}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n- With wild-type enzyme (synthesis plus editing), the fraction of incorrect product that survives to potentially be used for translation is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{e}}\\right).\n$$\n- With the mutant lacking editing, the fraction of incorrect product that survives is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right).\n$$\n\nHence, the fold increase in valine misincorporation when editing is deleted is\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{e}}\\right)}=D_{e}.\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given value $D_{e}=250$, the fold increase is $250$.
