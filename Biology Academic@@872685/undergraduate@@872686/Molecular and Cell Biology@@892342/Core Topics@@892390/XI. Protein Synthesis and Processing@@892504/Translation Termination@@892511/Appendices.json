{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The accuracy of protein synthesis depends on the precise recognition of signals within the mRNA. This practice explores the very first step of termination: how the ribosome 'reads' a stop codon. This is not a passive process, but an active decoding event mediated by specific proteins called Release Factors. By considering a hypothetical scenario where a key release factor is absent [@problem_id:2346469], you can dissect the logic of codon recognition and predict the immediate fate of a stalled ribosome.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the termination of protein synthesis is a critical step mediated by proteins known as Release Factors (RFs). The process begins when a ribosome encounters one of the three stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in its A-site. The specificity of recognition is as follows: Release Factor 1 (RF1) recognizes the stop codons UAA and UAG, while Release Factor 2 (RF2) recognizes UAA and UGA. Upon binding to the A-site, the appropriate release factor induces the hydrolysis of the bond connecting the polypeptide chain to the transfer RNA (tRNA) in the P-site, thereby freeing the newly synthesized protein.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered strain of *E. coli* in which the gene encoding RF1 has been inactivated, rendering the cell incapable of producing functional RF1 protein. The genes for RF2 and all other components of the translational machinery, including ribosomes and tRNAs, remain fully functional.\n\nA ribosome in a cell of this mutant strain is actively translating a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The process proceeds normally until the ribosome's A-site is positioned over a UAG codon. What is the most immediate and direct outcome for this specific ribosome and its nascent polypeptide chain?\n\nA. The polypeptide chain is released, but the ribosome remains bound to the mRNA.\n\nB. RF2 binds to the A-site and successfully mediates the release of the polypeptide chain.\n\nC. A suppressor tRNA binds to the UAG codon, adding an amino acid and allowing translation to continue.\n\nD. The ribosome stalls at the UAG codon, and the polypeptide remains covalently attached to the tRNA in the P-site.\n\nE. The ribosome disassembles, prematurely releasing the incomplete polypeptide chain and the mRNA.", "solution": "1) State the specificity of bacterial release factors as given: RF1 recognizes the set $S_{RF1}=\\{UAA, UAG\\}$ and RF2 recognizes the set $S_{RF2}=\\{UAA, UGA\\}$.\n\n2) In the engineered strain, RF1 is absent (nonfunctional), while RF2 is functional. Therefore, the only stop codons that can be recognized for termination are those in $S_{RF2}$.\n\n3) The ribosomal A-site encounters the codon $c=UAG$. Test for RF recognition: since $UAG \\notin S_{RF2}$, no release factor can bind the A-site at this codon.\n\n4) The biochemical step of termination requires a release factor’s GGQ-mediated catalysis of hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the nascent polypeptide to the P-site tRNA. Without an RF bound at the A-site, this hydrolysis reaction does not proceed, so the polypeptide remains covalently attached to the P-site tRNA.\n\n5) An elongator aminoacyl-tRNA cannot normally base-pair to a stop codon; binding of a suppressor tRNA would be a special, nonstandard event and is not implied by the problem. Thus, the immediate and direct consequence is not continuation of elongation but a kinetic stall.\n\n6) Rescue mechanisms (e.g., trans-translation by tmRNA-SmpB or alternative ribosome rescue factors) can act subsequently to resolve stalled ribosomes, but these are not immediate. Therefore, the most immediate and direct outcome is a stall at $UAG$ with the peptidyl-tRNA still in the P-site.\n\nConclusion: The correct choice is that the ribosome stalls at the UAG codon, and the polypeptide remains covalently attached to the tRNA in the P-site.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2346469"}, {"introduction": "Once a release factor binds to the stop codon, its job has only just begun. Its next task is to act as a catalyst, severing the link between the newly made polypeptide and its tRNA carrier. This exercise simulates a biochemical experiment using a hypothetical antibiotic to block a specific step in this process [@problem_id:2346462]. By analyzing the results, you can pinpoint the exact chemical reaction that release factors perform to liberate a finished protein.", "problem": "A new antibiotic, Aurosporin, is discovered and found to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis. In an in vitro translation experiment using *E. coli* extracts, ribosomes are allowed to translate a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that includes a stop codon. When Aurosporin is added to the reaction, it is observed that fully synthesized polypeptide chains accumulate but remain covalently attached to their respective transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which are stalled in the P-site of the ribosome. Further analysis confirms that a protein Release Factor (RF) is correctly bound to the stop codon in the A-site.\n\nBased on this observation, which of the following specific chemical reactions in the process of translation termination is most directly inhibited by Aurosporin?\n\nA. The binding of the Class I Release Factor (RF1 or RF2) to the stop codon in the ribosomal A-site.\n\nB. The hydrolysis of the ester bond connecting the polypeptide chain to the tRNA in the P-site.\n\nC. The Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis that facilitates the release of the Class I RF from the ribosome.\n\nD. The release of the deacylated tRNA from the P- and E-sites after polypeptide release.\n\nE. The dissociation of the 70S ribosome into its 30S and 50S subunits.", "solution": "We are told that, upon addition of Aurosporin to an in vitro translation reaction, fully synthesized polypeptide chains accumulate but remain covalently attached to their tRNA molecules in the P-site, while a Class I release factor is correctly bound to the stop codon in the A-site. In bacterial translation termination, the orderly sequence of events is:\n\n1) A Class I release factor (RF1 or RF2) recognizes and binds the stop codon in the A-site. This recognition event is upstream of catalytic hydrolysis and does not itself release the polypeptide.\n\n2) The Class I release factor, via its conserved GGQ motif acting in the peptidyl transferase center, catalyzes hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide to the tRNA at the P-site. The core chemical step is ester hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA linkage:\n$$\n\\text{Pep-tRNA}^{P} + H_{2}O \\to \\text{Pep} + \\text{tRNA}^{P}_{3'\\text{-}OH}.\n$$\nHere, $\\text{Pep-tRNA}^{P}$ denotes the peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site, and the products are a free polypeptide and deacylated tRNA with a restored $3'$-hydroxyl.\n\n3) After peptide release, a Class II release factor (RF3) uses GTP hydrolysis to promote dissociation of the Class I RF from the ribosome. This GTP hydrolysis step occurs after peptide release.\n\n4) Subsequently, the deacylated tRNA is released from the P- and E-sites, and finally the 70S ribosome can dissociate into its subunits to reset for another round.\n\nThe observation that polypeptide chains remain covalently attached to P-site tRNA demonstrates that the ester bond between the polypeptide and the tRNA has not been hydrolyzed. Since a Class I RF is already bound at the stop codon in the A-site, the binding step (choice A) is not inhibited. If GTP hydrolysis by RF3 were blocked (choice C), peptide hydrolysis would already have occurred before RF recycling; thus we would observe free peptide rather than peptidyl-tRNA. If release of deacylated tRNA (choice D) were inhibited, the tRNA would already be deacylated; again this contradicts the observed covalent attachment. If ribosome subunit dissociation (choice E) were inhibited, that also occurs downstream of peptide release and would not prevent hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester.\n\nTherefore, the specific chemical reaction most directly inhibited is the hydrolysis of the ester bond connecting the polypeptide to the P-site tRNA, i.e., the reaction\n$$\n\\text{Pep-tRNA}^{P} + H_{2}O \\to \\text{Pep} + \\text{tRNA}^{P}_{3'\\text{-}OH},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to choice B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2346462"}, {"introduction": "Releasing the finished protein is the climax of translation, but not the end of the story. For the cell to continue producing proteins efficiently, the used ribosomal machinery must be disassembled and recycled. This final, crucial stage involves a specialized protein, the Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF). This practice challenges you to predict what happens when this recycling machinery is blocked, highlighting the distinction between polypeptide release and the subsequent disassembly of the entire ribosomal complex [@problem_id:2346499].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher is using an *E. coli* strain to overproduce a specific protein. To study the process of protein synthesis, the researcher introduces a novel antibiotic called Recyclostatin into the bacterial culture. This drug has been shown to be a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the bacterial Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF), while having no effect on Release Factors (RFs) or Elongation Factor G (EF-G).\n\nConsider a single 70S ribosome that has just completed the synthesis of one full-length polypeptide chain and is now positioned at the stop codon of the mRNA. In the presence of Recyclostatin, what is the most likely fate of this specific ribosome-mRNA complex?\n\nA. The 70S ribosome will remain intact and bound to the mRNA at the stop codon, with a deacylated tRNA still associated, after the newly synthesized polypeptide has been released.\n\nB. The 70S ribosome will release the mRNA but fail to dissociate into its 30S and 50S subunits, remaining as an empty 70S particle in the cytoplasm.\n\nC. The polypeptide chain will remain covalently attached to the tRNA in the P-site, and the entire 70S ribosome-mRNA-peptidyl-tRNA complex will be stalled indefinitely at the stop codon.\n\nD. The 70S ribosome will fail to recognize the stop codon, causing it to continue translation into the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the mRNA.\n\nE. The 50S subunit will dissociate from the complex, but the 30S subunit will remain bound to the mRNA and the deacylated tRNA.", "solution": "We identify the relevant mechanistic steps of bacterial translation termination and recycling. After a translating 70S ribosome reaches a stop codon, class I release factors (RF1 or RF2) recognize the stop codon in the A site and catalyze hydrolysis of the ester bond between the polypeptide and the P-site tRNA, releasing the completed polypeptide. This step is independent of the ribosome recycling factor (RRF) and depends on the release factors, which are stated to be unaffected by Recyclostatin. Therefore, polypeptide release proceeds normally.\n\nFollowing peptide release, the ribosome is in the post-termination state: a 70S ribosome still bound to mRNA, with a deacylated tRNA typically remaining in the P site. Physiological recycling of this complex requires RRF acting together with elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP hydrolysis to promote dissociation of the 70S ribosome into its 30S and 50S subunits and to release the deacylated tRNA and mRNA. The problem states that Recyclostatin is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of RRF, while EF-G and RFs are unaffected. In the absence of functional RRF, EF-G alone cannot accomplish the recycling reaction; the 70S ribosome generally fails to split into subunits and cannot efficiently release the mRNA and deacylated tRNA from the post-termination complex.\n\nTherefore, in the presence of Recyclostatin, termination (peptide release) will occur normally due to intact RF function, but recycling will be blocked due to RRF inhibition. The most likely fate of the specific ribosome-mRNA complex is that the 70S ribosome remains intact and bound at the stop codon with a deacylated tRNA still associated, i.e., the post-termination complex persists without subunit dissociation or mRNA/tRNA release.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option A and excludes the alternatives:\n- B is unlikely because mRNA release typically accompanies RRF-mediated recycling; without RRF, mRNA is retained.\n- C is incorrect because RFs are functional, so the polypeptide does not remain covalently attached.\n- D is incorrect because stop-codon recognition is mediated by RFs, which are unaffected.\n- E is incorrect because subunit dissociation requires RRF; without it, 50S and 30S do not separate efficiently with the 30S remaining bound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346499"}]}
