{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey of an mRNA from a sequence of nucleotides to a functional protein begins with a critical first step: initiation. In eukaryotes, this process involves the ribosome scanning the mRNA for a specific signal to start translation. This exercise probes the very foundation of that rule by asking what happens when the canonical start codon, $AUG$, is replaced by a termination signal. By working through this scenario, you will solidify your understanding of the strict specificity of the initiation machinery and why a \"start\" signal cannot be confused with a \"stop\" signal [@problem_id:2346307].", "problem": "A researcher is studying the expression of a specific protein in a eukaryotic cell line. They perform a genetic engineering experiment where they use site-directed mutagenesis to alter the gene encoding this protein. The mutation specifically changes the first three nucleotides of the protein-coding sequence from AUG to UAG. The engineered gene is then successfully transcribed into a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule, which is properly capped and polyadenylated. This modified mRNA is introduced into the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the fate of this modified mRNA molecule during the process of translation?\n\nA. The mRNA will be translated into a full-length, but non-functional, protein because the ribosome ignores the first codon.\nB. A single amino acid, methionine, will be synthesized before the ribosome immediately dissociates from the mRNA.\nC. The small ribosomal subunit will bind to the 5' cap and scan the mRNA, but it will fail to initiate protein synthesis at the UAG site, resulting in no protein being produced from this start signal.\nD. The mRNA will be rapidly degraded by the cell's quality control machinery before any ribosome has a chance to bind to it.\nE. The ribosome will initiate translation at the UAG site and terminate immediately, producing no protein but consuming a molecule of GTP in the process.", "solution": "1) The engineered change converts the first triplet of the coding sequence from AUG (the canonical start codon) to UAG (a stop codon). The mRNA is capped and polyadenylated, so it will be recognized by the eukaryotic translation machinery.\n\n2) In eukaryotic translation initiation, the 43S preinitiation complex (40S small ribosomal subunit bound to eIF2-GTP-$Met-tRNA_i^{Met}$ and other initiation factors) is recruited to the 5' cap via the eIF4F complex and then scans the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction to locate the first AUG codon in an appropriate Kozak context.\n\n3) Start codon recognition requires codon-anticodon base pairing between AUG in the mRNA and the anticodon of $Met-tRNA_i^{Met}$. eIF1 and eIF1A enforce initiation fidelity, preventing initiation at non-AUG codons under standard conditions.\n\n4) UAG is a termination codon recognized by the eukaryotic release factor eRF1 during termination when a translating ribosome encounters it in the A site. It is not a start codon and cannot base pair with $Met-tRNA_i^{Met}$; therefore, the scanning 43S complex will not initiate translation at UAG.\n\n5) Because initiation cannot occur at UAG, the scanning complex will continue to scan downstream until it finds an AUG codon. If a downstream AUG exists, initiation may occur there; if not, no protein will be produced at all. Crucially, no protein is produced from the mutated first triplet.\n\n6) The presence of a 5' cap and poly(A) tail argues against immediate degradation before ribosome binding. Quality control pathways like nonsense-mediated decay generally require a round of translation to detect a premature termination codon; since initiation at UAG does not occur, that pathway is not triggered solely by the presence of UAG at the 5' end.\n\n7) Therefore, among the given choices, the most accurate statement is that the small ribosomal subunit binds the 5' cap and scans but fails to initiate at the UAG site, resulting in no protein being produced from that site.\n\n8) Option checks:\n- A is incorrect: the ribosome does not ignore the first codon; it requires AUG for initiation.\n- B is incorrect: methionine incorporation requires AUG; with UAG, initiation does not occur.\n- C is correct: scanning occurs, but initiation fails at UAG; no protein is produced from that start signal.\n- D is incorrect: the mRNA is not necessarily rapidly degraded before ribosome binding.\n- E is incorrect: initiation does not occur at UAG; thus there is no immediate termination at that site.\n\nThus the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2346307"}, {"introduction": "While the $AUG$ codon serves as the primary start signal, the cellular machinery does not treat every $AUG$ equally. The surrounding nucleotide sequence, known as the Kozak consensus sequence, plays a crucial role in modulating the efficiency of initiation. This practice explores a phenomenon called \"leaky scanning,\" where ribosomes might bypass a \"weak\" start codon in favor of a stronger one downstream. This problem illustrates how cells can leverage this mechanism to produce multiple, distinct protein products from a single mRNA transcript, adding a fascinating layer of regulatory complexity [@problem_id:1531808].", "problem": "A geneticist is investigating the expression of a newly discovered eukaryotic gene. The analysis of its messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) reveals an unusual feature in its 5' leader sequence. The transcript contains two potential translation initiation codons (AUG).\n\nThe first AUG codon is located in what is considered a \"weak\" Kozak consensus sequence. The second AUG codon is located 45 nucleotides downstream from the first, is in the same reading frame, and is situated within a \"strong\" or \"optimal\" Kozak consensus sequence. The single translation termination codon (UGA) for this open reading frame is located 315 nucleotides downstream of the second AUG codon.\n\nFor context in eukaryotic translation, the small ribosomal subunit (40S) binds near the 5' cap of the mRNA and scans downstream until it encounters an AUG codon. The efficiency with which the ribosome initiates translation at a given AUG is heavily influenced by the surrounding nucleotide sequence, known as the Kozak sequence. A \"strong\" Kozak sequence allows for efficient, high-fidelity initiation, while a \"weak\" Kozak sequence results in less efficient initiation, sometimes allowing the ribosome to continue scanning.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the protein products synthesized from this mRNA transcript in a eukaryotic cell?\n\nA. A single protein of 120 amino acids will be produced.\nB. A single protein of 105 amino acids will be produced.\nC. A mixture of two proteins will be produced: a 120-amino-acid protein and a 105-amino-acid protein, with the 120-amino-acid protein being the more abundant of the two.\nD. A mixture of two proteins will be produced: a 120-amino-acid protein and a 105-amino-acid protein, with the 105-amino-acid protein being the more abundant of the two.\nE. No stable protein will be synthesized because the ribosomal machinery cannot resolve the two start codons.", "solution": "The eukaryotic scanning model states that the 40S subunit binds near the 5' cap and scans in the 5' to 3' direction, initiating translation at the first AUG codon that is in an adequate Kozak context. A weak Kozak context leads to leaky scanning, where some ribosomes bypass the first AUG and continue scanning to a downstream AUG, especially if that downstream AUG is in a strong Kozak context.\n\nHere, there are two in-frame AUG codons. The second AUG is 45 nucleotides downstream of the first and is within a strong Kozak sequence, while the first AUG is within a weak Kozak sequence. Therefore:\n- Some ribosomes will initiate at the first AUG, producing a longer protein that includes the region between the first and second AUGs.\n- Many ribosomes will bypass the first AUG (leaky scanning) and initiate at the second AUG due to its strong Kozak context, producing a shorter, N-terminally truncated protein.\n\nCompute the lengths:\n- The distance from the second AUG to the single stop codon is 315 nucleotides, which encodes\n$$\n\\frac{315}{3} = 105 \\text{ amino acids}.\n$$\n- The region between the first and second AUGs is 45 nucleotides, which encodes\n$$\n\\frac{45}{3} = 15 \\text{ amino acids}.\n$$\n- Therefore, initiation at the first AUG yields a protein whose length is\n$$\n\\frac{45 + 315}{3} = \\frac{360}{3} = 120 \\text{ amino acids}.\n$$\n\nRelative abundance follows from initiation efficiency. Because the first AUG is in a weak Kozak context and the second AUG is in a strong Kozak context, leaky scanning will favor initiation at the second AUG. Thus, both proteins will be produced, but the 105-amino-acid protein (starting at the strong Kozak AUG) will be more abundant than the 120-amino-acid protein.\n\nTherefore, the correct outcome is a mixture of two proteins, 120 and 105 amino acids, with the 105-amino-acid protein being more abundant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1531808"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative principles, this final practice challenges you to think like a research scientist by analyzing quantitative experimental data. You will examine the function of an upstream Open Reading Frame (uORF), a common regulatory element that can repress the translation of the main protein-coding sequence.

The start codon for FLuc is 100% efficient, meaning any ribosome that scans to its location will initiate translation.\n2. Any ribosome that successfully initiates translation at the uORF will complete its translation and then dissociate from the mRNA, and cannot contribute to the translation of the downstream FLuc cistron (i.e., there is no translational reinitiation).\n\nBased on this experimental data and the provided model, calculate the ratio of the translational initiation efficiency of the wild-type uORF start codon to that of the mutant uORF start codon.
