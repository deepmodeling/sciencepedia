This exercise focuses on the small ribosomal subunit and its role in the accurate initiation of translation in prokaryotes. By considering the effect of a targeted deletion in the 16S rRNA, you will connect a specific molecular structure—the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence—to its essential function in selecting the correct start site on messenger RNA [@problem_id:2336290].", "problem": "In a molecular biology experiment, a research team creates a mutant strain of the prokaryote *Escherichia coli*. This strain has a targeted deletion of the final 9 nucleotides from the 3' terminus of the gene that codes for the $16\\text{S}$ ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid (rRNA). While the mutant $16\\text{S}$ rRNA is successfully transcribed and assembled into the $30\\text{S}$ small ribosomal subunit, the overall efficiency of protein synthesis is dramatically reduced. Assume that all other cellular components, including messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts and transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, are normal.\n\nBased on your understanding of prokaryotic translation, which of the following fundamental stages of protein synthesis is most directly and severely impaired by this specific deletion?\n\nA. Initiation\n\nB. Elongation\n\nC. Termination\n\nD. tRNA Charging", "solution": "1. Identify the molecular alteration: the mutation removes the final 9 nucleotides from the 3' terminus of the $16\\text{S}$ rRNA in the $30\\text{S}$ small ribosomal subunit. This region of $16\\text{S}$ rRNA normally contains the anti–Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence.\n2. State the relevant principle of prokaryotic translation initiation: in bacteria, the ASD sequence at the 3' end of $16\\text{S}$ rRNA base-pairs with the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence on the mRNA, aligning the start codon in the P site of the $30\\text{S}$ subunit and enabling proper formation of the $30\\text{S}$ initiation complex with initiator fMet-tRNA and initiation factors.\n3. Infer the functional consequence of the deletion: deleting the terminal 9 nucleotides at the 3' end removes or severely disrupts the ASD, abolishing or greatly weakening SD–ASD base pairing. This directly impairs start-site selection and $30\\text{S}$ initiation complex formation, leading to a dramatic reduction in initiation efficiency.\n4. Exclude other stages by mechanism: elongation primarily depends on the decoding center within $16\\text{S}$ rRNA (internal helices such as h44) and $50\\text{S}$ peptidyl-transferase activity, not on the extreme 3' tail; termination depends on release factors and functions at the A site; tRNA charging is catalyzed by aminoacyl–tRNA synthetases and is independent of ribosomal rRNA. Given all other components are normal and the $30\\text{S}$ subunit assembles, the most direct and severe defect is in initiation.\n5. Conclude the most affected stage: initiation is most directly and severely impaired by loss of the 3' terminal ASD region of $16\\text{S}$ rRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2336290"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into the catalytic heart of the ribosome, the Peptidyl Transferase Center (PTC), where the central reaction of protein synthesis occurs. This problem explores the profound discovery that the ribosome is a ribozyme—an enzyme made of RNA. You will analyze how a subtle change in the 23S rRNA, which forms the active site, impacts the rate of peptide bond formation, highlighting the principle of substrate-assisted catalysis and solidifying the concept of RNA as a biological catalyst [@problem_id:2336309].", "problem": "An investigator is studying the catalytic mechanism of the prokaryotic ribosome. The central reaction, peptide bond formation, occurs within the Peptidyl Transferase Center (PTC), an active site located in the large ribosomal subunit ($50\\text{S}$) composed almost entirely of $23\\text{S}$ ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The reaction involves the transfer of the growing polypeptide chain from the transfer RNA (tRNA) in the P-site to the amino acid attached to the tRNA in the A-site.\n\nIt is well-established that the ribosome achieves its remarkable catalytic efficiency by precisely orienting the substrates. A key interaction involves the $23\\text{S}$ rRNA positioning the 2'-hydroxyl (2'-OH) group of the terminal adenosine residue (A76) of the P-site tRNA. An experiment is designed where a single-nucleotide point mutation is introduced into the gene encoding the $23\\text{S}$ rRNA. This mutation specifically disrupts the hydrogen bonding network responsible for holding the 2'-OH group of the P-site tRNA's A76 in its proper catalytic position, without altering the overall structure of the PTC.\n\nAssuming the mutant ribosomes can still assemble correctly and bind both mRNA and tRNA, what is the most likely direct consequence of this specific mutation on the peptidyl transferase reaction?\n\nA. The rate of peptide bond formation will be severely reduced.\n\nB. The binding affinity of the peptidyl-tRNA for the P-site will be significantly decreased, leading to premature dissociation.\n\nC. The fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA selection at the A-site will be compromised.\n\nD. The ribosome will be unable to translocate along the mRNA after a peptide bond is formed.\n\nE. The ester bond linking the polypeptide to the P-site tRNA will be preferentially hydrolyzed by a water molecule.", "solution": "The peptidyl transferase reaction in the ribosome proceeds by nucleophilic attack of the A-site amino group on the carbonyl carbon of the peptidyl ester at the P-site, forming a tetrahedral intermediate and resulting in transfer of the peptide to the A-site tRNA. Symbolically, the net transformation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}O{-}tRNA_{P}} + \\mathrm{H_{2}N{-}R'{-}tRNA_{A}} \\to \\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}NH{-}R'} + \\mathrm{HO{-}tRNA_{P}}.\n$$\nExtensive biochemical and structural data support that the ribosome’s catalytic power is predominantly due to precise substrate positioning and a proton shuttle mediated by the 2'-hydroxyl of A76 of the P-site tRNA. In the accepted substrate-assisted catalysis model, the 2'-OH of A76 is positioned by a hydrogen-bonding network in the $23\\text{S}$ rRNA so that it can facilitate proton transfer between the attacking A-site amine and the P-site 3'-O leaving group, thereby lowering the activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increasing $k_{\\text{cat}}$ for peptidyl transfer.\n\nThe mutation described specifically disrupts the hydrogen bonds that position the P-site tRNA A76 2'-OH, while leaving the overall PTC architecture intact and not impairing assembly or tRNA/mRNA binding. Displacing the 2'-OH from its catalytic geometry impairs its role as a general acid/base proton shuttle, thus increasing $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for the chemical step and directly decreasing the rate of peptide bond formation (reduced $k_{\\text{cat}}$).\n\nBy contrast:\n- P-site binding affinity (option B) is mediated by multiple interactions beyond the A76 2'-OH positioning network; the mutation is specified to affect catalysis without altering overall PTC structure or tRNA binding.\n- A-site selection fidelity (option C) primarily involves the small subunit decoding center and factor-assisted selection, not the PTC 2'-OH positioning.\n- Translocation (option D) is mediated by factor EF-G and large-scale conformational changes after catalysis, not by the 2'-OH positioning.\n- Preferential hydrolysis by water (option E) is unlikely because the PTC excludes water and the described change removes a catalytic aid rather than introducing a general base for water.\n\nTherefore, the most direct consequence is a severe reduction in the rate of peptide bond formation.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2336309"}]}
