This first exercise [@problem_id:1529620] challenges you to apply the principle of antiparallel alignment and the specific pairing rules that govern the 'wobble' position. Mastering this allows you to predict which specific mRNA codons a given tRNA can bind to, a foundational skill in molecular genetics.", "problem": "In a genetics research laboratory, a team is studying the mechanism of protein synthesis in a specific archaeon. They have isolated a transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA) that is charged with the amino acid glutamine. Through sequencing, they determine that the anticodon of this glutamine-specific tRNA is 5'-CUG-3'. The team knows that in this organism, glutamine is encoded by two possible codons on a messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) transcript: 5'-CAA-3' and 5'-CAG-3'.\n\nThe central principle of codon-anticodon recognition involves antiparallel alignment and base pairing. Standard Watson-Crick base pairing rules are G with C, and A with U. However, the pairing between the third base of the mRNA codon (at the 3' end) and the first base of the tRNA anticodon (at the 5' end) is less stringent and is governed by what is known as the wobble hypothesis.\n\nBased on these principles, determine which of the two glutamine codons will be recognized by the tRNA with the anticodon 5'-CUG-3', and select the option that provides the correct justification.\n\nA. The codon 5'-CAG-3' is recognized because the anticodon aligns antiparallelly, and the cytosine (C) at the 5' \"wobble\" position of the anticodon specifically pairs only with the guanine (G) at the 3' position of the codon.\n\nB. The codon 5'-CAA-3' is recognized because the guanine (G) at the 3' end of the anticodon can \"wobble\" to form a non-standard pair with the adenine (A) at the 5' end of the codon.\n\nC. Both 5'-CAA-3' and 5'-CAG-3' are recognized because the cytosine (C) at the 5' \"wobble\" position of the anticodon is capable of pairing with either adenine (A) or guanine (G).\n\nD. The codon 5'-CAG-3' is recognized because the middle base of the anticodon, uracil (U), stabilizes the wobble interaction at the third position.\n\nE. Neither codon is recognized because perfect Watson-Crick pairing is required at all three positions for a stable interaction, and the CUG anticodon does not perfectly match either codon.", "solution": "Anticodon-codon pairing is antiparallel: the tRNA anticodon written $5'\\to 3'$ pairs with the mRNA codon written $5'\\to 3'$ in opposite orientation. The given anticodon is $5'\\text{-CUG-}3'$, which in the $3'\\to 5'$ orientation is $3'\\text{-GUC-}5'$. The reverse complement that would pair under standard Watson-Crick rules is therefore $5'\\text{-CAG-}3'$, since C pairs with G and U pairs with A at the first two positions (codon positions $1$ and $2$), which generally require strict pairing.\n\nWobble applies at the third position of the codon (the $3'$ end of the codon) and the first position of the anticodon (the $5'$ end of the anticodon). The wobble pairing rules for the $5'$ anticodon base include: C pairs only with G; A pairs only with U; U pairs with A or G; G pairs with U or C; I pairs with U, C, or A. Here, the $5'$ base of the anticodon is C, so at the wobble position it can pair only with G in the codon’s $3'$ position.\n\nAmong the two glutamine codons, $5'\\text{-CAG-}3'$ has G at the $3'$ position and satisfies the wobble constraint with the C at the anticodon's $5'$ position. The codon $5'\\text{-CAA-}3'$ has A at the $3'$ position, which cannot pair with C at the anticodon's $5'$ position. Therefore, only $5'\\text{-CAG-}3'$ is recognized, and the correct justification is that the $5'$ C of the anticodon pairs specifically with the codon's $3'$ G under wobble rules.\n\nOption A states exactly this antiparallel alignment and wobble specificity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1529620"}, {"introduction": "The efficiency of protein synthesis is greatly enhanced by modified nucleosides in tRNA anticodons, and inosine is a prime example.

The 'I' in the sequence represents inosine, a modified purine nucleoside often found in tRNA.\n\nThe interaction between the messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) codon and the tRNA anticodon follows specific pairing rules. The pairing is antiparallel. Standard Watson-Crick base pairing (Guanine with Cytosine, Adenine with Uracil) occurs for the first two bases of the codon. However, at the third position of the codon (the \"wobble position\"), pairing is more flexible. For this organism, an inosine (I) at the first position of the anticodon is known to pair with Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), or Uracil (U) in the third position of the mRNA codon.\n\nGiven this information, identify all of the following 5' to 3' mRNA codons that can be recognized by this tRNA.\n\nA. 5'-GCA-3'\n\nB. 5'-GCG-3'\n\nC. 5'-GCC-3'\n\nD. 5'-GCU-3'\n\nE. 5'-UCG-3'\n\nF. 5'-CGC-3'", "solution": "The anticodon is given as $5'\\text{-IGC-}3'$.
