In a somatic cell of a diploid organism, the chromosome number is $2n$.\n\nDuring S phase preceding mitosis, each chromosome replicates to form two sister chromatids joined at a centromere. Thus, at metaphase of mitosis, the number of chromosomes remains $2n$, but each chromosome consists of $2$ sister chromatids.

This thought experiment probes the heart of that switch by considering a hypothetical mutation in the inhibitory protein, securin. By predicting the consequences of disrupting the interaction between securin and the protease separase, you can deduce the logic of this elegant regulatory pathway that ensures sister chromatids separate only when the time is right. [@problem_id:2324349]", "problem": "In a healthy eukaryotic cell, the transition from metaphase to anaphase is a tightly regulated event. This transition is initiated by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Once all chromosomes are properly aligned at the metaphase plate, the APC/C is activated and targets the protein securin for degradation. Securin normally acts as an inhibitor by binding to and inactivating a protease called separase. The degradation of securin liberates separase, which then cleaves the cohesin complexes holding sister chromatids together, allowing them to separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cell line that has been engineered with a specific point mutation in the gene encoding the securin protein. This mutation completely abolishes the ability of the securin protein to bind to separase. Assume that all other cellular components, including separase, cohesin, and the APC/C, are wild-type and fully functional.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the direct consequence of this securin mutation on the cell's progression through mitosis?\n\nA. The cell would arrest permanently in metaphase because the spindle assembly checkpoint would remain active indefinitely.\n\nB. The separation of sister chromatids would occur prematurely, as separase would be active independent of APC/C-mediated securin degradation.\n\nC. Sister chromatids would fail to separate, and the cell would become trapped in an anaphase-like state with chromosomes stuck at the metaphase plate.\n\nD. The APC/C would fail to target M-phase cyclins for degradation, causing the cell to be unable to exit mitosis.\n\nE. The cohesin complexes would become hyper-stabilized, requiring a much higher concentration of separase to initiate anaphase.", "solution": "Logical framework:\n1) In wild-type cells, securin binds to separase and inhibits its protease activity. The metaphase-to-anaphase transition is triggered when APC/C ubiquitinates securin, promoting its proteasomal degradation. This liberates separase, which then cleaves cohesin to separate sister chromatids.\n\n2) In the engineered mutant, securin cannot bind separase. Therefore, the inhibitory complex between securin and separase cannot form at any time in the cell cycle. As a direct consequence, separase is not restrained by securin and its activation no longer depends on APC/C-mediated securin degradation.\n\n3) With separase free of securin, the most immediate and direct outcome is premature separase activity relative to the proper timing set by the spindle assembly checkpoint and APC/C activation. This would lead to premature cleavage of cohesin and premature sister chromatid separation.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: a permanent metaphase arrest due to an active checkpoint is not the direct consequence of removing securin inhibition; rather, separase activation would occur prematurely even without APC/C action on securin. While such premature separation may create chromosome attachment/tension defects that could perturb the checkpoint, the direct and primary effect is not a metaphase arrest.\n- B is correct: separase becomes active independent of APC/C-mediated securin degradation, leading to premature sister chromatid separation.\n- C is incorrect: failure to separate would occur if separase remained inhibited; here, inhibition is lost.\n- D is incorrect: APC/C targeting of M cyclins is not dependent on securin binding; the mutation does not prevent APC/C from degrading cyclin substrates.\n- E is incorrect: cohesin would be cleaved more readily, not hyper-stabilized.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the direct consequence is premature sister chromatid separation due to separase activity independent of securin degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2324349"}, {"introduction": "Proper chromosome segregation depends not only on regulatory timing but also on the structural integrity of each chromosome. This problem explores the critical role of the centromere by asking you to predict the fate of an 'acentric' chromosome fragment that lacks this essential structure. This scenario, which models a common outcome of DNA damage, highlights why the kinetochore is indispensable for spindle attachment and reveals the cellular consequences of failing to properly segregate a piece of the genome. [@problem_id:2324379]", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a population of synchronized eukaryotic cells is treated with a specific clastogenic agent during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This agent induces a single double-strand break in one arm of a single chromosome. The cellular repair mechanisms fail to ligate the break before the cell enters mitosis. As a result, the cell enters prophase with one chromosome that has been fractured into two pieces: a large fragment containing the centromere, and a smaller 'acentric fragment' which lacks a centromere. Assuming the cell's spindle assembly checkpoint is not activated by this event and the cell proceeds through mitosis, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected fate of the acentric fragment during metaphase and anaphase?\n\nA. The acentric fragment will align independently at the metaphase plate and subsequently be segregated in a 1:1 ratio to the two daughter cells during anaphase.\n\nB. The acentric fragment will fail to attach to the mitotic spindle. It will drift randomly within the cytoplasm and, following anaphase, will most likely be excluded from both newly formed daughter nuclei, often resulting in the formation of a micronucleus.\n\nC. The acentric fragment will be recognized as unattached by the mitotic checkpoint complex, which will permanently arrest the cell in metaphase, preventing the onset of anaphase and leading to apoptosis.\n\nD. The acentric fragment will be actively transported towards one of the two spindle poles before metaphase is complete, guaranteeing its inclusion in only one of the two daughter cells.\n\nE. The acentric fragment will re-associate with the centromere-containing fragment through non-covalent interactions, allowing it to be properly segregated along with its parent chromosome.", "solution": "We analyze the fate of an acentric fragment during mitosis by applying core principles of chromosome segregation. First, correct attachment to the mitotic spindle requires a kinetochore, which assembles on centromeric chromatin. Therefore, only chromosome fragments containing a centromere can form a kinetochore and attach to spindle microtubules in a end-on manner. An acentric fragment, by definition, lacks a centromere and thus cannot form a kinetochore. Consequently, it cannot establish proper spindle attachments and cannot congress to the metaphase plate.\n\nSecond, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors attachment status and tension at kinetochores. Unattached kinetochores generate the mitotic checkpoint complex to delay anaphase onset. However, because an acentric fragment has no kinetochore, it does not produce an unattached-kinetochore signal. Under the problem’s assumption that the checkpoint is not otherwise activated, the cell will proceed into anaphase despite the presence of the acentric fragment.\n\nThird, lacking kinetochore-mediated capture, the acentric fragment typically fails to be segregated in a controlled, 1:1 manner. It may drift passively in the cytoplasm, sometimes associating nonspecifically with microtubules or other cellular structures, but without a kinetochore it is not reliably transported to a pole. As the nuclear envelope reassembles around the segregated chromatid sets, the acentric fragment is often excluded from the main daughter nuclei. This exclusion commonly results in its encapsulation as a separate, small nucleus-like structure, termed a micronucleus.\n\nThese principles directly eliminate the alternatives: it cannot align and segregate 1:1 (rejecting A); it does not trigger a sustained SAC arrest because there is no unattached kinetochore (rejecting C); there is no mechanism guaranteeing active, directed poleward transport to ensure inclusion in one daughter (rejecting D); and it will not re-associate via non-covalent interactions in a way that restores proper segregation without covalent repair (rejecting E). The most accurate description is that it fails to attach, drifts, and is typically excluded to form a micronucleus, which matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2324379"}]}
