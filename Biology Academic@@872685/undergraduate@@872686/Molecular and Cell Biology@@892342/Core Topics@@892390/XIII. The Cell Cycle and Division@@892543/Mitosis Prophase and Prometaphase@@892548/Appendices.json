{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The classic 'X' shape of a mitotic chromosome is iconic, but it is crucial to understand that this structure is the result of two distinct cellular processes: DNA replication during S phase and chromosome condensation during prophase. This exercise challenges you to conceptually separate these events. By considering a hypothetical scenario where a cell bypasses replication, you can clarify the fundamental difference between a chromosome and a chromatid and appreciate why S phase is an absolute prerequisite for creating the sister chromatid pairs that will be segregated in mitosis. [@problem_id:2324680]", "problem": "In a typical eukaryotic cell cycle, a cell in the G1 phase contains a diploid (2n) number of chromosomes, with each chromosome consisting of a single Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule. The cell then proceeds through the S phase, where its DNA is replicated, and the G2 phase, before entering mitosis (M phase).\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a researcher treats a population of cultured animal cells with a chemical agent. This agent effectively disables the G1/S checkpoint, causing cells to proceed directly from the G1 phase into the M phase, completely bypassing the S and G2 phases.\n\nAssuming such a cell successfully enters prophase, which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of its chromosomes?\n\nA. Each chromosome would appear as a classic 'X' shape, composed of two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere.\n\nB. The DNA would fail to condense, remaining as a diffuse mass of chromatin.\n\nC. The cell would contain half the diploid number of chromosomes (n), and each would consist of a single chromatid.\n\nD. Each chromosome would be condensed and visible, but would consist of only a single chromatid rather than two sister chromatids.\n\nE. The cell would contain the diploid number of chromosomes (2n), but they would be fragmented into numerous small pieces due to the stress of premature condensation.", "solution": "A diploid somatic cell in G1 contains $2n$ chromosomes, each chromosome being a single, continuous DNA molecule organized with associated proteins; structurally, each chromosome in G1 consists of one chromatid. During a normal cell cycle, passage through S phase replicates the DNA so that each chromosome comprises two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere; by G2 and prophase, these duplicated chromosomes condense and the characteristic 'X' shape reflects the paired sister chromatids.\n\nIn the hypothetical scenario, disabling the G1/S checkpoint and forcing cells to bypass S and G2 means no DNA replication occurs. Therefore, when such a cell enters prophase, mitotic condensation mechanisms (e.g., condensin loading and mitotic kinase activity) can still compact the chromosomes, but there will be no sister chromatid pairs because replication never took place. Consequently:\n- The chromosome number remains $2n$ (no reduction in chromosome number occurs without meiosis or chromosome loss).\n- Each chromosome can condense and become visible in prophase.\n- Each condensed chromosome will consist of a single chromatid rather than two sister chromatids.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the 'X' shape requires sister chromatid formation in S phase.\n- B is incorrect because prophase triggers condensation; diffuse chromatin would not persist if the cell truly entered prophase.\n- C is incorrect because the chromosome number remains $2n$, not $n$.\n- D is correct: chromosomes will be condensed and visible, each as a single chromatid.\n- E is incorrect because fragmentation is not the expected consequence of bypassing S and G2; the defining effect here is absence of sister chromatids, not generalized fragmentation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that each chromosome is condensed and visible but consists of only a single chromatid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2324680"}, {"introduction": "Once chromosomes are condensed, the cell must build the sophisticated machinery to separate them: the mitotic spindle. A key event in prophase is the separation of the duplicated centrosomes to establish the two opposing poles of this spindle. This process is not passive; it is an active mechanical task driven by molecular motors, like Kinesin-5, that push microtubules apart. This problem explores the direct structural consequence of inhibiting this specific motor, providing a clear link between a single protein's function and the overall architecture of the cell during mitosis. [@problem_id:2324675]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanics of the cell cycle using a synchronized population of mammalian fibroblast cells. The biologist treats these cells with a newly developed small molecule inhibitor, \"Kinesin-X Block,\" just as the cells are about to enter M-phase. This inhibitor has been shown to specifically and completely disable the function of Kinesin-5, a motor protein essential for exerting the outward-pushing force that separates the duplicated centrosomes during prophase. All other cellular processes, including chromosome condensation, centriole duplication, and microtubule polymerization, remain unaffected by the drug.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence for a cell attempting to undergo mitosis in the presence of Kinesin-X Block?\n\nA. The cell will form a normal bipolar spindle but will be unable to condense its chromosomes, arresting in early prophase.\n\nB. The cell will successfully form a bipolar spindle and align its chromosomes at the metaphase plate, but will be unable to initiate anaphase.\n\nC. The cell will form a multipolar spindle, with three or more spindle poles, leading to immediate apoptotic cell death.\n\nD. The cell will fail to enter mitosis and will remain arrested in the G2 phase with duplicated, but unseparated, centrosomes.\n\nE. The cell will form a monopolar spindle, composed of a single aster of microtubules, and will arrest in a state resembling prometaphase.", "solution": "Kinesin-5 (also called Eg5) is a plus-end-directed, tetrameric kinesin that crosslinks antiparallel microtubules and generates the outward sliding force needed to separate duplicated centrosomes during prophase and to establish and maintain a bipolar spindle. Inhibition of Kinesin-5 abolishes this outward-pushing force.\n\nGiven that chromosome condensation, centriole duplication, and microtubule polymerization remain intact, the cells will still enter mitosis: chromosomes will condense, the nuclear envelope will break down, and microtubules will nucleate from the centrosomes. However, without Kinesin-5 activity, duplicated centrosomes fail to separate. In the absence of the Eg5-mediated outward force, inward-directed forces (for example, those mediated by dynein and other minus-end-directed activities) dominate, causing spindle microtubules to form a single aster focused around unseparated centrosomes. This results in a monopolar spindle, often termed a monoaster.\n\nBecause a bipolar spindle cannot form, kinetochores cannot achieve stable, amphitelic attachments, which activates the spindle assembly checkpoint. The cell arrests in a prometaphase-like state rather than progressing to metaphase or anaphase.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because chromosome condensation is unaffected by Kinesin-5 inhibition.\n- B is incorrect because a bipolar spindle does not form; thus, alignment at the metaphase plate and normal anaphase onset cannot occur.\n- C is incorrect because Kinesin-5 inhibition classically yields monopolar, not multipolar, spindles.\n- D is incorrect because cells do enter mitosis; the block occurs at spindle assembly, not at G2 entry.\n- E correctly states that a monopolar spindle forms and that the cell arrests in a prometaphase-like state.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate consequence is a monopolar spindle and prometaphase-like arrest.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2324675"}, {"introduction": "The intricate sequence of events in prophase—from chromosome condensation and cohesin modification to centrosome maturation and separation—must be precisely coordinated. This orchestration is largely achieved by master regulatory kinases, such as Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which phosphorylate numerous targets to trigger different processes in concert. By examining the multiple failures that occur when Plk1 is inactivated, this exercise provides an integrated view of how a single signaling molecule can control the entire entry into mitosis, highlighting the interconnected nature of these cellular events. [@problem_id:2324620]", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying mitotic progression using a specially engineered human cell line. This cell line contains a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele for Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical serine/threonine kinase. At the permissive temperature of 32°C, the ts-Plk1 protein functions normally. However, when the cells are shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 39°C, the ts-Plk1 protein rapidly unfolds and becomes non-functional.\n\nThe researchers synchronize a population of these cells at the G2/M boundary and then shift them to the non-permissive temperature of 39°C, effectively inactivating all Plk1 activity as they attempt to enter prophase. They then observe the cells to determine the consequences of this inactivation.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes correctly describe a primary failure that would be observed in these cells during prophase and prometaphase? Select all valid options.\n\nA. Failure of the duplicated centrosomes to fully separate and establish opposing poles of the mitotic spindle.\n\nB. Premature cleavage and dissociation of cohesin complexes from the centromeres.\n\nC. Complete failure of chromosomes to undergo their initial condensation into visible, compact structures.\n\nD. A significant reduction in the Microtubule (MT) nucleating capacity of the centrosomes.\n\nE. Persistence of cohesin complexes along the chromosome arms.\n\nF. Stabilization of the nuclear envelope, preventing its breakdown.", "solution": "Plk1 is a serine/threonine kinase that performs several essential, early mitotic functions as cells enter and progress through prophase and prometaphase. Key roles include: (i) promoting centrosome maturation by recruiting pericentriolar material such as CEP192, NEDD1, and $\\gamma$-tubulin ring complexes to boost microtubule nucleation; (ii) driving centrosome separation and establishment of bipolar spindle poles by regulating motors such as kinesin Eg5 and the Nek9-Nek6/7 pathway; and (iii) executing the prophase pathway of cohesin release from chromosome arms through phosphorylation of cohesin-associated factors (for example SA subunits and sororin) to enable Wapl-mediated dissociation.\n\nConsequences of acute Plk1 inactivation at the G2/M boundary as cells attempt to enter prophase therefore include:\n- Failure or strong impairment of centrosome separation, leading to defects in establishing opposing spindle poles. This supports option A.\n- A significant reduction in centrosomal microtubule nucleation capacity due to defective centrosome maturation. This supports option D.\n- Failure of the prophase pathway of cohesin removal from chromosome arms, causing cohesin to persist on arms. This supports option E.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Premature cleavage of centromeric cohesin (option B) requires separase activation after APC/C-mediated securin destruction at anaphase and is not caused by loss of Plk1; if anything, Plk1 deficiency impairs cohesin removal on chromosome arms rather than triggering premature centromeric cleavage.\n- Complete failure of initial chromosome condensation (option C) is unlikely, because initial condensation in prophase is primarily driven by condensin II and Cdk1 (with Aurora B), whereas Plk1 plays supportive roles; condensation may be perturbed or delayed but not completely absent as a primary consequence.\n- Stabilization of the nuclear envelope preventing its breakdown (option F) overstates the role of Plk1; nuclear envelope breakdown is primarily driven by Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of lamins and nuclear pore components, with Plk1 acting as a contributor rather than an absolute requirement, so complete prevention is not the expected primary phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the primary failures expected upon Plk1 inactivation during prophase and prometaphase are described by A, D, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "2324620"}]}
