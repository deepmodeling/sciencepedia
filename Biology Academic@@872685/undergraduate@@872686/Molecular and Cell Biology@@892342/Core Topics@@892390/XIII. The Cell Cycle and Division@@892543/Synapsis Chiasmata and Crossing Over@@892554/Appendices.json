By observing cells under a microscope during prophase I, we can identify key structures that tell a story about an organism's genetic makeup. This first practice focuses on interpreting these cytological observations, specifically how counting the bivalents—the paired homologous chromosomes—allows us to directly determine the fundamental diploid number, $2n$, of a species. [@problem_id:2340100]", "problem": "A cytogeneticist is analyzing the meiotic process in a newly discovered species of fern. Cells undergoing meiosis are isolated from the sporangia. One particular cell is observed to be in diakinesis, a late stage of prophase I. Within this cell, the genetic material is organized into 10 discrete, compact units. Each unit is a bivalent, which consists of a pair of synapsed homologous chromosomes, and is therefore composed of a total of four chromatids. Based on this observation, determine the diploid number ($2n$) of this fern species.", "solution": "In diakinesis of prophase I, homologous chromosomes are paired as bivalents (tetrads). The number of bivalents observed equals the haploid number, $n$, because each bivalent represents one homologous pair.\n\nGiven that there are 10 bivalents observed, we have:\n$$\nn = 10.\n$$\nThe diploid number is twice the haploid number, so:\n$$\n2n = 2 \\times n = 2 \\times 10 = 20.\n$$\nTherefore, the diploid number of this fern species is 20.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "2340100"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying chromosome numbers, the real power of understanding crossing over lies in its predictive genetic power. When genes are located on the same chromosome, crossing over between them can create new combinations of alleles in the gametes. This exercise demonstrates how we can use the physical distance between two genes and the regional rate of recombination to calculate the expected frequency of these new, recombinant genotypes. [@problem_id:2340114]", "problem": "In the fictional bioluminescent fungus *Noctiluca phantasma*, two genes are of interest for their role in light production. The first gene, *$LuxA$*, controls the color of the light (Dominant allele $A$ for blue, recessive allele $a$ for green). The second gene, *$RegB$*, controls the light's intensity (Dominant allele $B$ for bright, recessive allele $b$ for dim). These two genes are known to be located on the same chromosome.\n\nA mycologist creates a heterozygous strain by crossing a pure-breeding blue, bright-glowing fungus ($AABB$) with a pure-breeding green, dim-glowing fungus ($aabb$). The resulting heterozygous fungus ($AaBb$) has the parental chromosome configuration where alleles $A$ and $B$ are on one chromosome, and alleles $a$ and $b$ are on the homologous chromosome.\n\nFrom extensive genomic sequencing and analysis of meiotic products, it has been determined that the physical distance between the *$LuxA$* locus and the *$RegB$* locus is 2.25 million base pairs (Mbp). The average rate of meiotic recombination for this specific chromosomal region is established to be 3.40 centiMorgans (cM) per Mbp. A centiMorgan is a genetic map unit that corresponds to a 1% recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that multiple crossover events between these two specific loci are rare enough to be considered negligible, calculate the expected proportion of spores produced by the heterozygous fungus that will have the genotype $aB$.

With single crossovers only (multiple crossovers negligible), the possible meiotic products are:\n- Nonrecombinants: $AB$ and $ab$.\n- Recombinants: $Ab$ and $aB$, each occurring with equal probability among recombinants.\n\nFirst compute the genetic map distance between the loci from the given physical distance and regional recombination rate. If $L$ is the physical distance in Mbp and $R$ is the rate in cM per Mbp, then the genetic distance in cM is\n$$\ng=RL.\n$$\nWith $R=3.40$ cM/Mbp and $L=2.25$ Mbp,\n$$\ng=(3.40)(2.25)=7.65\\ \\text{cM}.\n$$\nBy definition of the centiMorgan, the recombination fraction $r$ (as a decimal) is\n$$\nr=\\frac{g}{100}=\\frac{7.65}{100}=0.0765.\n$$\nUnder the single-crossover approximation in a coupling heterozygote, the two recombinant classes $Ab$ and $aB$ are equally frequent, so the proportion of spores with genotype $aB$ is $P(aB)=\\frac{r}{2}=\\frac{0.0765}{2}=0.03825$.\n\nRounded to four significant figures, this is already $0.03825$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.03825}$$", "id": "2340114"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's scale up our thinking from a pair of genes to the entire genome.
