In a normal cell, ligand binding causes the associated Gs protein's alpha subunit (Gs-alpha) to release guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The GTP-bound Gs-alpha subunit then activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The signaling is terminated when the Gs-alpha subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP back to GDP, causing it to become inactive.\n\nThe biologist then engineers a new cell line with a specific mutation in the gene for the Gs-alpha subunit. This mutation renders the Gs-alpha protein completely incapable of hydrolyzing GTP, although it can still bind GTP and activate adenylyl cyclase normally.\n\nIf these mutated cells are briefly exposed to the hormone ligand and then the ligand is washed away, which of the following statements best describes the expected long-term concentration of intracellular cAMP compared to that in a normal cell treated in the same way?\n\nA.

Termination in a normal cell relies on the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gs-alpha, which hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, returning Gs-alpha to its inactive form and stopping adenylyl cyclase stimulation.\n\nLet $A(t)$ denote the effective concentration of active, GTP-bound Gs-alpha after a brief ligand pulse and washout. In a normal cell, $A(t)$ decays back to zero due to GTP hydrolysis, with a characteristic rate constant $k_{h}>0$, so $A(t)\\to 0$ after the pulse. In the mutant cell, the GTPase activity is abolished, so the hydrolysis rate is effectively zero, $k_{h}=0$, and the GTP-bound state persists; after the brief stimulus loads Gs-alpha with GTP, $A(t)$ remains at a positive value $A_{0}>0$ for long times, because there is no intrinsic mechanism to return Gs-alpha to the GDP-bound inactive state.\n\nLet $C(t)$ denote intracellular cAMP concentration.
