The first is a growth-promoting pathway initiated by a Growth Factor Receptor (GFR). When activated by its ligand, GFR becomes phosphorylated. An Adaptor Protein S (APS) then binds to the phosphorylated GFR to form an active signaling complex, [GFR-APS], which promotes cell cycle progression.\n\nThe second pathway is a stress response pathway activated by nutrient deprivation. This pathway activates a Nutrient-stress Kinase (NSK). Active NSK phosphorylates APS at a site that prevents it from binding to GFR. This phosphorylated form of APS is then sequestered and is unavailable for the growth-promoting pathway.\n\nConsider a cell where the total intracellular concentration of APS is $[APS]_{total} = 100.0$ nM. In the presence of a saturating amount of growth factor, the concentration of activated, phosphorylated GFR available for binding is constant at $[GFR^*] = 20.0$ nM. The binding and dissociation between APS and GFR* is a rapid equilibrium process described by the reaction $GFR^* + APS \\rightleftharpoons GFR\\text{-}APS$, with a dissociation constant $K_D = 50.0$ nM.\n\nWhen the cell is subjected to prolonged nutrient deprivation, the NSK pathway becomes fully active, leading to a steady state where 90.0% of the total APS protein is phosphorylated and sequestered.\n\nCalculate the fractional reduction in the concentration of the active signaling complex, [GFR-APS], when the cell is under prolonged nutrient deprivation compared to the nutrient-rich condition.
