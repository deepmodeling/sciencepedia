The concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ in the ER lumen is high, while the concentration in the cytosol is kept very low. This gradient is established and maintained primarily by the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA) pump, which actively transports $Ca^{2+}$ from the cytosol into the ER lumen, a process that requires energy from ATP hydrolysis. This active transport counteracts a slow, passive leak of $Ca^{2+}$ from the ER back into the cytosol through various channels.\n\nA cell biologist is studying intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ signaling and treats a culture of these cells with thapsigargin, a compound known to be a highly specific and irreversible inhibitor of the SERCA pump. Assuming the cells are in a resting state before treatment, what are the expected immediate effects on the steady-state concentrations of free $Ca^{2+}$ in the cytosol and in the ER lumen after the addition of thapsigargin?\n\nA.

Two primary hypotheses are being considered. The first is the Gap Junctional Diffusion (GJD) hypothesis, which posits that a signaling molecule, Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), diffuses directly from an activated cell to its neighbors through gap junctions, triggering $Ca^{2+}$ release from their internal stores. The second is the ATP-Purinergic Signaling (APS) hypothesis, a \"bucket brigade\" model, where an activated cell releases Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into the extracellular space. This ATP then binds to purinergic P2Y receptors on neighboring cells, initiating a G-protein coupled cascade that generates IP3 and subsequent $Ca^{2+}$ release in those cells, which may in turn release their own ATP.\n\nTo distinguish between these hypotheses, the researcher has developed a sophisticated experimental system. The culture is a mix of two astrocyte types:\n1.  **\"Opto-Astros\"**: These cells are genetically engineered to express both a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) marker and a Gq-coupled optogenetic tool. Upon stimulation with a focused pulse of $470 \\text{ nm}$ light, this tool activates phospholipase C, leading to the rapid intracellular production of IP3 and a subsequent rise in cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$.\n2.  **\"Reporter-Astros\"**: These are wild-type cells that do not express GFP and do not respond to $470 \\text{ nm}$ light. They are loaded with a ratiometric fluorescent $Ca^{2+}$ indicator dye, Fura-2, allowing for the measurement of their intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration. Both cell types are capable of forming gap junctions with their neighbors.\n\nA single GFP-positive Opto-Astro is stimulated with a precise laser pulse, and the propagation of the resulting $Ca^{2+}$ wave is observed by measuring the number of responding Reporter-Astros in the surrounding field within a 60-second window. In the baseline control experiment (with no pharmacological agents), the wave reliably propagates to $N$ Reporter-Astros. It is also established that pre-treatment of the culture with Thapsigargin, a Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA) pump inhibitor that depletes internal $Ca^{2+}$ stores, completely abolishes wave propagation under all conditions.\n\nThe experiment is then repeated in the presence of several different pharmacological agents. Which of the following sets of outcomes would provide the most definitive and unambiguous evidence that the ATP-Purinergic Signaling (APS) hypothesis is the primary mechanism of wave propagation in this system?\n\nThe agents used are:\n- **Carbenoxolone (CBX)**: A non-specific blocker of gap junctions.\n- **Suramin**: A broad-spectrum antagonist for P2-purinergic receptors.\n- **Apyrase**: An extracellular enzyme that rapidly hydrolyzes ATP to AMP.\n\nLet the number of responding Reporter-Astros be measured for each condition.\n\nA.
