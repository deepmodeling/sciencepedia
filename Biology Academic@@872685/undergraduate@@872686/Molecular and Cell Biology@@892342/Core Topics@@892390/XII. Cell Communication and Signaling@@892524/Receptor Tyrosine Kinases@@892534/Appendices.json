{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly grasp how Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) work, we must dissect the specific function of each of their domains. This first practice presents a classic thought experiment where key tyrosine residues on the receptor's tail are mutated. This exercise will help you pinpoint the critical role these residues play as docking sites for downstream signaling proteins, clarifying the distinction between the activation of the receptor's kinase activity and the subsequent propagation of the signal throughout the cell [@problem_id:2311547].", "problem": "In a cellular biology laboratory, researchers are investigating a signal transduction pathway initiated by a specific growth factor. This pathway relies on a transmembrane protein known as a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK). The standard activation of this RTK involves the binding of the growth factor, which causes two receptor monomers to form a dimer. This dimerization activates the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor's intracellular domain, leading each monomer to phosphorylate the other on several specific tyrosine residues located on its cytoplasmic tail. These phosphotyrosine sites then serve as docking platforms for various downstream intracellular signaling proteins, which propagate the signal.\n\nTo probe the mechanism, the researchers create a genetically engineered version of the cell line. In this mutant cell line, the gene for the RTK has been altered such that every single tyrosine residue on the intracellular cytoplasmic tail has been replaced with an alanine residue. Alanine is an amino acid that cannot be phosphorylated. The researchers then expose both the normal (wild-type) and the mutant cell lines to a high concentration of the growth factor.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the direct consequence of this mutation on the RTK signaling process immediately following the addition of the growth factor?\n\nA. The growth factor will fail to bind to the extracellular domain of the mutant RTK.\n\nB. The mutant RTK monomers will not be able to form a dimer in the presence of the growth factor.\n\nC. The intracellular kinase domains of the mutant RTK dimer will not be activated.\n\nD. The mutant RTK dimer will form and its kinase domains will be active, but no downstream signaling proteins will be recruited to the receptor.\n\nE. The mutant RTK will be constitutively active, leading to continuous signaling even in the absence of the growth factor.", "solution": "We identify the sequence of RTK signaling events and assess which steps depend on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail versus other domains.\n\nStep 1: Ligand binding. The growth factor binds the extracellular domain. This process depends on the extracellular ligand-binding domain and is independent of cytoplasmic tail tyrosine residues. Therefore, replacing cytoplasmic tail tyrosines with alanines does not prevent ligand binding. This rules out option A.\n\nStep 2: Receptor dimerization. Ligand-induced dimerization is mediated by conformational changes and interactions in the extracellular domain (and sometimes transmembrane/juxtamembrane regions). Cytoplasmic tail tyrosine residues are not required for dimerization. Therefore, dimerization still occurs in the mutant. This rules out option B.\n\nStep 3: Kinase activation. Dimerization juxtaposes the intracellular kinase domains, enabling activation. Activation often involves trans-autophosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop within the kinase domain, which are not part of the cytoplasmic tail. The mutation specifically targets tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail, not the kinase domain. Thus, the intrinsic kinase domains can still become activated upon dimerization. This rules out option C.\n\nStep 4: Creation of docking sites and recruitment of downstream effectors. In wild-type RTKs, the activated kinases phosphorylate multiple tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail, generating phosphotyrosine motifs that are recognized by SH2/PTB domain-containing proteins. In the mutant, all tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail are replaced by alanine, which cannot be phosphorylated, so no phosphotyrosine docking sites can be formed on the tail. Consequently, downstream signaling proteins cannot be recruited to the receptor despite active kinase domains and successful dimerization.\n\nStep 5: Constitutive activity assessment. Alanine substitution of tail tyrosines does not induce ligand-independent dimerization or kinase activity. Therefore, the receptor is not constitutively active in the absence of ligand. This rules out option E.\n\nTherefore, immediately after growth factor addition, the mutant RTK will bind ligand, dimerize, and activate its kinase domains, but fail to recruit downstream signaling proteins due to the absence of phosphorylatable tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail. This corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2311547"}, {"introduction": "Building on the modular nature of proteins, this next exercise explores what happens when we \"mix and match\" domains from different RTKs. You are presented with a chimeric receptor, a hybrid constructed from the parts of two distinct receptors that normally trigger very different cellular responses. This practice challenges you to predict the cell's reaction by understanding that the extracellular domain acts as the \"antenna\" for a specific signal, while the intracellular domain dictates the specific \"instructions\" relayed inside the cell [@problem_id:2334988].", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a line of engineered cells is created that expresses a novel chimeric receptor protein. This receptor is constructed by fusing the entire extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the human Insulin Receptor (IR). These specialized cells do not express any other native EGFR or IR proteins. The cells are initially maintained in a culture medium devoid of both Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and insulin. The experiment is then initiated by adding a sufficient concentration of EGF to the culture medium.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most direct and primary physiological consequence that would be observed in these cells following the addition of EGF?\n\nA. Activation of the Ras/MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway, a hallmark of canonical EGF receptor signaling.\n\nB. The receptor binds insulin with high affinity, initiating a metabolic signaling cascade.\n\nC. Increased uptake of glucose from the medium, mediated by the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane.\n\nD. The receptor fails to undergo autophosphorylation because EGF cannot allosterically activate the insulin receptor's kinase domain.\n\nE. The cells are stimulated to proliferate but show no significant change in their rate of glucose metabolism.", "solution": "- The engineered receptor is a chimera with the extracellular domain from EGFR and the transmembrane plus intracellular domains from the insulin receptor (IR). Ligand-binding specificity is determined by the extracellular domain; intracellular signaling output is determined by the intracellular domain.\n- Upon addition of EGF, the EGFR extracellular domain will bind EGF. In canonical EGFR, EGF binding induces receptor dimerization, which juxtaposes intracellular kinase domains for trans-autophosphorylation. In the chimera, EGF-induced dimerization of the EGFR ectodomains will similarly bring together the IR intracellular kinase domains, enabling their trans-autophosphorylation and activation. Therefore, autophosphorylation should occur rather than fail, contradicting option D.\n- Because the intracellular domain is that of the IR, the downstream signaling will follow insulin receptor pathways. The IR primarily signals via IRS proteins to PI3K, generating PIP3 and activating PDK1 and Akt. A principal physiological consequence of IR-Akt signaling in insulin-responsive cells is phosphorylation of AS160 (TBC1D4) and consequent translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, increasing glucose uptake. This is the hallmark metabolic effect of insulin receptor activation. Hence, the most direct and primary physiological consequence expected here is increased glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation (option C).\n- The receptor will not bind insulin with high affinity because ligand binding is determined by the EGFR extracellular domain, so option B is incorrect.\n- While the Ras/MAPK pathway can also be engaged downstream of IR via Shc/Grb2/SOS, option A frames this as a hallmark of canonical EGFR signaling; in the chimera, the dominant signaling identity is IR-like, and the most characteristic primary physiological readout is metabolic (glucose uptake), not specifically a canonical EGFR proliferative program, making C the better answer.\n- Option E is inconsistent with the IR intracellular domain, which drives metabolic effects, notably increased glucose uptake, rather than exclusively proliferation without metabolic change.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and primary consequence after adding EGF is increased glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334988"}, {"introduction": "Signaling outcomes are not just about a single receptor, but about the entire population of receptors on a cell's surface. This final practice moves to a quantitative challenge involving a mixture of functional wild-type receptors and non-functional mutant receptors. By calculating the impact of these \"dominant negative\" mutants, you will see how they can interfere with and dramatically suppress the total signaling output, a crucial concept in both disease mechanisms and therapeutic design [@problem_id:2334993].", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a cell line is genetically engineered to study the signaling pathway of a specific Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK). This engineered cell line co-expresses two versions of the receptor: the normal, wild-type (WT) version and a mutant (MT) version. The mutant RTK contains a point mutation in the ATP-binding site of its intracellular kinase domain, which renders it catalytically inactive; it cannot phosphorylate any substrates. However, the mutation does not affect the mutant receptor's ability to bind its extracellular ligand or to form dimers with other receptors.\n\nThe total surface expression level of RTKs (WT plus MT) in the engineered cell line is the same as in a control cell line that only expresses the WT receptor. In the engineered cell line, the expression level of the MT receptor is precisely three times that of the WT receptor. Upon stimulation with a saturating concentration of the ligand, receptors on the cell surface randomly form dimers. A downstream signaling cascade is initiated only by fully active dimers, which are defined as WT-WT homodimers in which each receptor partner can reciprocally phosphorylate the other (trans-autophosphorylation).
