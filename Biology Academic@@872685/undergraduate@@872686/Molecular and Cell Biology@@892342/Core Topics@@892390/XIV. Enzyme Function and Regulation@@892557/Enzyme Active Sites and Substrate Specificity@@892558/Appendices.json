It specifically binds to its substrate, dodecane ($C_{12}H_{26}$), which is a long, nonpolar hydrocarbon chain. The strength of this binding is quantified by the dissociation constant, $K_d$. A smaller $K_d$ value indicates a higher binding affinity.\n\nAn experiment is conducted in two different solvent environments. First, the $K_d$ for the binding of dodecane to Lipidex is measured in a standard aqueous buffer at pH 7.4. Second, the entire experiment is repeated, but this time the solvent is changed from the aqueous buffer to pure liquid hexane ($C_6H_{14}$), a nonpolar organic solvent.\n\nAssume that the enzyme maintains its correct three-dimensional folded structure and remains catalytically active in the hexane solvent. Based on the principles of molecular interactions and thermodynamics, predict the most likely outcome for the dissociation constant ($K_d$) when the solvent is changed from the aqueous buffer to hexane.\n\nA. The $K_d$ will decrease significantly, indicating much stronger binding.\n\nB. The $K_d$ will increase significantly, indicating much weaker binding.\n\nC. The $K_d$ will remain approximately the same because the intrinsic van der Waals forces between the substrate and the active site are independent of the solvent.\n\nD. The binding process will switch from being primarily entropy-driven to enthalpy-driven, but the overall $K_d$ will not change significantly.", "solution": "Define the binding equilibrium in a given solvent $s$ as $E + L \\rightleftharpoons EL$ with dissociation constant $K_{d,s}$ and association constant $K_{a,s} = \\frac{1}{K_{d,s}}$. The standard Gibbs free energy of binding in solvent $s$ is related to $K_{d,s}$ by\n$$\n\\Delta G_{s}^{0} = -R T \\ln K_{a,s} = R T \\ln K_{d,s}.\n$$\nThus, if $\\Delta G_{s}^{0}$ becomes less favorable (more positive), then $K_{d,s}$ increases; conversely, if $\\Delta G_{s}^{0}$ becomes more favorable (more negative), then $K_{d,s}$ decreases.\n\nDecompose the binding free energy into enthalpic and entropic contributions in solvent $s$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{s}^{0} = \\Delta H_{s}^{0} - T \\Delta S_{s}^{0}.\n$$\nFurther partition the contributions into contact terms (ligand–active-site interactions, largely van der Waals for a nonpolar ligand and pocket) and solvent-dependent terms (desolvation and solvent entropy):\n$$\n\\Delta H_{s}^{0} = \\Delta H_{\\text{contact}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{desolv},s}, \\quad\n\\Delta S_{s}^{0} = \\Delta S_{\\text{conf}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{solv},s}.\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta H_{\\text{contact}}$ arises from ligand–pocket dispersion contacts and is expected to be similar across solvents because the same noncovalent contacts form in the bound complex. $\\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}$ reflects the loss of translational, rotational, and conformational freedom upon binding and is negative in any solvent. The solvent-dependent terms $\\Delta H_{\\text{desolv},s}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\text{solv},s}$ differ strongly between water and hexane.\n\nIn water (aqueous buffer), a nonpolar ligand and a hydrophobic pocket are poorly solvated by water. Binding buries nonpolar surface area and releases structured water molecules from the ligand surface and from the hydrophobic pocket. This yields a large, favorable solvent entropy term:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{solv},\\text{water}} \\gg 0 \\quad \\text{(hydrophobic effect)}.\n$$\nBecause water–nonpolar interactions are weak, the enthalpic penalty for desolvation is relatively small:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{desolv},\\text{water}} \\gtrsim 0 \\ \\text{(small penalty)},\n$$\nwhile $\\Delta H_{\\text{contact}}$ is favorable due to van der Waals complementarity.

This is a classic case of competitive inhibition, where the product acts as the inhibitor.\n\nFirst, we recall the standard Michaelis-Menten equation, which describes the initial reaction velocity ($v_0$) as a function of substrate concentration ($[S]$), maximum velocity ($V_{max}$), and the Michaelis constant ($K_M$):\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\n\nIn the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the inhibitor molecule binds reversibly to the enzyme's active site, preventing the substrate from binding.
