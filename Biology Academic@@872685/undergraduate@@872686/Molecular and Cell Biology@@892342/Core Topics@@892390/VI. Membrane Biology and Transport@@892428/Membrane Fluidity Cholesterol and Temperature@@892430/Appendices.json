The fluidity of this membrane is a critical property, as it affects permeability and the function of embedded proteins. This fluidity is highly dependent on temperature; lower temperatures tend to decrease fluidity, while higher temperatures increase it. In animal cells, the steroid molecule cholesterol is interspersed among the phospholipid tails within the lipid bilayer. Consider the role of cholesterol in modulating membrane fluidity as the cell is exposed to a range of physiological temperatures. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary function of cholesterol with respect to membrane fluidity?\n\nA. Cholesterol consistently increases membrane fluidity across all physiological temperatures by preventing the tight packing of phospholipids.\n\nB. Cholesterol consistently decreases membrane fluidity across all physiological temperatures by restricting the movement of phospholipids.\n\nC. Cholesterol functions as a 'fluidity buffer', resisting the changes in membrane fluidity that would otherwise occur with increases or decreases in temperature.\n\nD. Cholesterol exclusively serves to decrease membrane fluidity at high temperatures, having no significant effect at low temperatures.\n\nE. Cholesterol's primary role is to anchor membrane proteins, and its effect on membrane fluidity is a minor, secondary consequence.", "solution": "1. The fluid mosaic model posits that membrane fluidity depends on phospholipid tail interactions and temperature. Lower temperature increases ordered packing of fatty acid tails, reducing fluidity; higher temperature increases kinetic motion, enhancing fluidity and permeability.\n\n2. Cholesterol has a rigid, planar ring structure intercalated among phospholipid tails. Its effects are bidirectional:\n- At low temperature: cholesterol disrupts tight packing of phospholipid tails by inserting between them, thereby preventing solidification and increasing relative fluidity.\n- At high temperature: cholesterol restrains excessive movement of phospholipid tails due to its rigid structure, reducing fluidity and permeability relative to what would occur without cholesterol.\n\n3. Therefore, cholesterol does not uniformly increase or decrease fluidity; instead, it buffers changes in fluidity across temperature ranges, opposing the direction of change that temperature alone would impose.\n\n4. Evaluate options:\n- A is incorrect because cholesterol does not consistently increase fluidity; at high temperatures it decreases relative fluidity.\n- B is incorrect because cholesterol does not consistently decrease fluidity; at low temperatures it increases relative fluidity by preventing tight packing.\n- C is correct because cholesterol acts as a fluidity buffer, mitigating temperature-induced changes.\n- D is incorrect because cholesterol also has a significant effect at low temperatures by preventing solidification.\n- E is incorrect because while cholesterol can influence protein behavior indirectly, its primary, well-established role in membranes is modulation of lipid bilayer fluidity as described.\n\nThus, the statement that best captures cholesterol’s primary function regarding membrane fluidity across physiological temperatures is that it acts as a fluidity buffer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2322676"}, {"introduction": "Beyond cholesterol, the intrinsic properties of phospholipids themselves are primary determinants of membrane fluidity. This practice challenges you to think like a biochemist designing artificial membranes, or liposomes. You will need to predict the relative fluidity of different liposomes by considering the molecular geometry of their fatty acid tails—comparing saturated, *cis*-unsaturated, and *trans*-unsaturated chains—and the ordering effect of cholesterol [@problem_id:2322680].", "problem": "A student in a cell biology lab is investigating the factors that influence membrane fluidity.

IV > II > III > I", "solution": "Key principles for membrane fluidity at physiological temperature:\n- Saturated, long fatty acyl chains pack tightly via van der Waals interactions, decreasing fluidity.\n- A cis double bond introduces a kink that disrupts packing, increases free volume, lowers the melting temperature, and increases fluidity relative to saturated chains.\n- A trans double bond produces a relatively straight chain that packs more like a saturated chain; thus, a trans-unsaturated tail confers much less fluidity than a cis-unsaturated tail and is closer to saturated in its packing behavior.\n- Cholesterol acts as a fluidity buffer: above the phase transition temperature of the lipid, it tends to order acyl chains and reduce fluidity; below the transition temperature, it disrupts packing and increases fluidity. At physiological temperature for typical phospholipids with cis-unsaturated tails, cholesterol generally decreases fluidity relative to the cholesterol-free membrane.\n\nApply these principles:\n- Liposome I (two long saturated tails) packs most tightly, thus has the lowest fluidity.\n- Liposome II (one saturated, one cis-unsaturated tail) has a pronounced kink disrupting packing, giving the highest fluidity among the cholesterol-free liposomes described.\n- Liposome III (one saturated, one trans-unsaturated tail) is comparatively straight and packs more like saturated tails; therefore, it is less fluid than Liposome II but generally more fluid than Liposome I.\n- Liposome IV (the Liposome II lipid with cholesterol at a mole fraction of 0.20) will have reduced fluidity relative to Liposome II at physiological temperature due to cholesterol’s ordering effect. However, because 0.80 of the lipids still contain a cis kink, it remains more fluid than the trans-rich Liposome III.\n\nTherefore, from most to least fluid: Liposome II, then Liposome IV, then Liposome III, then Liposome I.
