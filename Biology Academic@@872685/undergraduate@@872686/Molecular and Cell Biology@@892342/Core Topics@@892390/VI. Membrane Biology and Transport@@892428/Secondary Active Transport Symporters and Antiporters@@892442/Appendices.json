This process is a form of secondary active transport, where the downhill movement of sodium ions ($Na^+$) into the cell provides the energy to move glucose molecules against their concentration gradient into the cell.\n\nImagine a specific genetic mutation occurs in the gene encoding the SGLT2 protein. This mutation alters the protein's structure such that it completely loses its ability to bind $Na^+$ ions. However, its glucose binding site and its ability to undergo the conformational changes that shuttle the binding site from one side of the membrane to the other remain perfectly intact.\n\nAssuming this mutated SGLT2 protein is correctly inserted into the cell membrane, which of the following transport mechanisms would it now mediate for glucose?\n\nA.

Thus, the mutant can still bind glucose and shuttle it across the membrane along its concentration gradient via a carrier-mediated pathway. This is carrier-mediated passive transport (uniport), i.e., facilitated diffusion.\n\nIt is not simple diffusion because the process still requires a specific protein pathway rather than direct permeation through the lipid bilayer.

The cells are incubated in a medium with an extracellular sodium concentration of 145 mM and an extracellular Glycine concentration of 0.2 mM.
