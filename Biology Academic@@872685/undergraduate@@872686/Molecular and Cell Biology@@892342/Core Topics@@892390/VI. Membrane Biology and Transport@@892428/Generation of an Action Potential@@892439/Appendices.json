When a sufficiently strong stimulus is applied, the membrane potential depolarizes to a threshold value (around -55 mV), triggering an action potential. In a healthy neuron, this process involves two key events:\n\n1.  **Depolarization:** Voltage-gated sodium ($Na^{+}$) channels open rapidly, allowing a massive influx of $Na^{+}$ ions, which causes the membrane potential to shoot up to a peak of about +30 mV.\n2.  **Repolarization:** Shortly after opening, the voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channels inactivate. Almost simultaneously, slower voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channels open, allowing an efflux of $K^{+}$ ions, which rapidly brings the membrane potential back down, often briefly hyperpolarizing it below the resting potential.\n\nConsider a hypothetical neuron with a genetic mutation that prevents its voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels from opening in response to changes in membrane potential. All other components, including voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channels (which still open and inactivate normally), $K^{+}$ leak channels (which are always open and primarily set the resting potential), and the Na+/K+ pump, are fully functional.\n\nIf a stimulus strong enough to reach the threshold potential is applied to this mutant neuron, which of the following statements best describes the resulting change in membrane potential over time?\n\nA.

In the mutant, with no increase in potassium conductance above the leak level, the trajectory governed by the leak equation above approaches $E_{L}$ monotonically from above without crossing below it.
