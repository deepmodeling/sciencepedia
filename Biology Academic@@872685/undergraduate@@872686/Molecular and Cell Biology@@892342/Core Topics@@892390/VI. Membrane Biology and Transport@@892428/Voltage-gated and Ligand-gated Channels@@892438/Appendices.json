The intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations are maintained as follows:\n- Potassium ($[K^{+}]$): 140 mM inside, 5 mM outside\n- Sodium ($[Na^{+}]$): 15 mM inside, 145 mM outside\n- Chloride ($[Cl^{-}]$): 10 mM inside, 110 mM outside\n\nUnder normal resting conditions, the relative permeabilities of the neuronal membrane to these ions are in the ratio $P_K : P_{Na} : P_{Cl} = 1 : 0.04 : 0.45$.\n\nThe neurobiologist then introduces a genetic mutation that alters the structure of the resting (leak) potassium channels. This mutation widens the channel's selectivity filter, making it less specific. As a result of this change across the entire population of channels in the membrane, the overall membrane permeability to sodium ($P_{Na}$) increases to ten times its original resting value, while the overall membrane permeability to potassium ($P_K$) decreases to 80% of its original resting value. The permeability to chloride ($P_{Cl}$) is unaffected.\n\nAssume the analysis is conducted at a temperature where the term $(RT/F)$ in the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation allows for a simplification, such that the membrane potential $V_m$ in millivolts (mV) can be calculated using base-10 logarithm: $V_m = 61.5 \\log_{10}(\\text{ion ratio})$.\n\nCalculate the new resting membrane potential of the neuron after the mutation has taken effect.

After mutation, $P_{Na}$ increases tenfold and $P_{K}$ decreases to $0.8$ of its original value, while $P_{Cl}$ is unchanged.

The precise shape and duration of an action potential are critical for its function and depend on the orchestrated activity of voltage-gated channels. This problem challenges you to predict the consequences of disrupting a key step in this process—the inactivation of sodium channels—thereby deepening your understanding of the ionic basis of the action potential [@problem_id:2347760].", "problem": "In neurobiology, the precise functioning of ion channels is critical for generating and propagating action potentials. A typical neuron at rest maintains a negative membrane potential. When a stimulus raises the membrane potential to a certain threshold, voltage-gated sodium ($Na^{+}$) channels rapidly open, allowing an influx of $Na^{+}$ ions that causes a sharp depolarization of the membrane. Shortly after opening, these $Na^{+}$ channels enter a non-conductive, inactivated state, which, in conjunction with the opening of voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channels, allows the membrane to repolarize by an efflux of $K^{+}$ ions.\n\nConsider a hypothetical neurotoxin, Scorpoxin-V, which selectively binds to the voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channels of a neuron. The toxin's unique mechanism of action is to prevent the inactivation gate of the $Na^{+}$ channel from closing after it has been opened by a depolarizing stimulus. The channel can still close from its open state when the membrane repolarizes, but it cannot enter the inactivated state. Assume all other cellular components, including the voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels and the $Na^{+}-K^{+}$ pump, function normally.\n\nIf a neuron is exposed to Scorpoxin-V and an action potential is successfully initiated by a suprathreshold stimulus, what is the most direct and immediate consequence for the shape and duration of that action potential?\n\nA. The neuron fails to reach the threshold for an action potential.\n\nB. The repolarization phase of the action potential is significantly shortened, causing the neuron to fire at a much higher frequency.\n\nC. The amplitude of the action potential is significantly reduced because fewer $Na^{+}$ ions can enter the cell.\n\nD. The membrane potential remains at a prolonged depolarized plateau, delaying or preventing the repolarization phase.\n\nE. The after-hyperpolarization phase becomes much deeper and longer-lasting due to excessive $K^{+}$ efflux.", "solution": "We model the excitable membrane with the Hodgkin–Huxley formalism. The membrane voltage $V$ obeys\n$$\nC \\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\left(I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right),\n$$\nwith ionic currents\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} = g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} h \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right), \\quad\nI_{\\mathrm{K}} = g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right), \\quad\nI_{\\mathrm{L}} = g_{\\mathrm{L}} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right).\n$$\nIn a normal neuron, a suprathreshold depolarization rapidly increases the activation variable $m$ toward large values (opening Na$^{+}$ channels), while the inactivation variable $h$ then decreases (closing via inactivation), so that $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ shuts off quickly. The delayed activation of $n$ increases $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$, producing repolarization and, while $n$ remains elevated and $h$ remains low, an after-hyperpolarization.\n\nUnder Scorpoxin-V, the inactivation gate cannot close once opened. In Hodgkin–Huxley terms, during the action potential $h$ is prevented from decreasing, so we can treat $h \\approx 1$ throughout the depolarized phase. The channels can still deactivate upon repolarization, so $m$ retains its usual voltage dependence: it is large at depolarized $V$ and decreases only when $V$ repolarizes.\n\nImmediately after the upstroke, with $m$ large and $h \\approx 1$, the Na$^{+}$ current\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\approx g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right)\n$$\nremains strongly inward at depolarized $V$. At the same time, the delayed rectifier K$^{+}$ current\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{K}} = g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right)\n$$\ngrows outward. Because $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ does not inactivate, repolarization cannot proceed as in the normal case; instead, the membrane approaches a quasi-steady depolarized level where the net current vanishes:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\ng_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right) + g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right) + g_{\\mathrm{L}} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right) = 0.\n$$\nSince $m$ is kept high by the depolarized $V$, the inward Na$^{+}$ current persists, opposing repolarization and producing a prolonged depolarized plateau. Only when $V$ is finally driven sufficiently negative (by accumulating K$^{+}$ activation and leak) will $m$ deactivate, allowing $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ to fall and repolarization to complete. Thus, the most direct and immediate effect on the action potential’s shape is a delayed or prevented repolarization with a prolonged depolarized plateau.\n\nThis rules out the alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because a suprathreshold stimulus initiates the action potential by assumption.\n- B is incorrect; repolarization is prolonged, not shortened, and firing frequency would decrease, not increase.\n- C is incorrect; Na$^{+}$ influx is sustained rather than reduced during the spike, so amplitude is not directly decreased by fewer Na$^{+}$ entries.\n- E is incorrect; persistent inward Na$^{+}$ current opposes, rather than deepens, the after-hyperpolarization.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is a prolonged depolarized plateau delaying or preventing repolarization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2347760"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves from fundamental principles to real-world application, mirroring the work of neuropharmacologists.
