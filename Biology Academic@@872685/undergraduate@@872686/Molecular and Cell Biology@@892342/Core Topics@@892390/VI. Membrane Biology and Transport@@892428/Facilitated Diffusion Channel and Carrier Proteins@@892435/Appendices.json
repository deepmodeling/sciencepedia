This practice presents a scenario with hypothetical experimental data, challenging you to deduce the identity of two different transport proteins based on their kinetic profiles. By analyzing the relationship between solute concentration and transport rate, you can uncover the signature behaviors that define these two essential classes of membrane proteins [@problem_id:2315820].", "problem": "An experimental biologist is investigating the transport of a specific amino acid, Tryptophan, across the plasma membrane of a newly discovered eukaryotic cell. The transport is known to be a form of facilitated diffusion, occurring at rates significantly faster than simple diffusion across a lipid bilayer. The biologist isolates and reconstitutes two different integral membrane proteins, Protein X and Protein Y, into artificial lipid vesicles and measures the initial rate of Tryptophan uptake as a function of external Tryptophan concentration.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n- For vesicles containing **Protein X**, the transport rate is observed to be directly proportional to the Tryptophan concentration over the entire tested range from 0 to 100 mM. At the highest concentration, the measured transport rate is approximately $10^7$ molecules per second per protein.\n- For vesicles containing **Protein Y**, the transport rate increases with Tryptophan concentration at low concentrations, but the rate of increase progressively slows. At concentrations above 25 mM, the transport rate effectively reaches a plateau, showing no significant further increase. The maximum rate achieved at this plateau is approximately $10^3$ molecules per second per protein.\n\nBased on these distinct kinetic profiles, what are the most likely identities of Protein X and Protein Y?\n\nA. Protein X is a carrier protein, and Protein Y is a channel protein.\n\nB. Protein X is a channel protein, and Protein Y is a carrier protein.\n\nC. Both Protein X and Protein Y are channel proteins.\n\nD. Both Protein X and Protein Y are carrier proteins.\n\nE. Protein X uses primary active transport, and Protein Y is a carrier protein.", "solution": "We identify the transport mechanism types by their kinetic signatures and turnover capacities.\n\nFirst, facilitated diffusion via channels provides a continuous aqueous pathway. The net flux for a channel in the initial-rate regime with negligible internal substrate is proportional to the external concentration, following a linear relation consistent with Fick-type behavior:\n$$\nv \\propto \\Delta C \\approx [\\text{Trp}]_{\\text{out}}.\n$$\nChannels also exhibit very high turnover numbers per protein, typically on the order of $10^{7}$ to $10^{8}$ molecules per second per channel, because multiple solute molecules pass through the open pore in rapid succession without requiring large conformational changes per transport event.\n\nSecond, facilitated diffusion via carriers (transporters) proceeds through alternating-access conformational changes, producing saturable kinetics described by a Michaelis–Menten form:\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}[\\text{Trp}]_{\\text{out}}}{K_{M} + [\\text{Trp}]_{\\text{out}}}.\n$$\nThis yields initial proportionality at low concentrations and a plateau at high concentrations when $[\\text{Trp}]_{\\text{out}} \\gg K_{M}$, where $v \\to V_{\\max}$. Carrier turnover numbers are typically much lower than channels, often about $10^{1}$ to $10^{3}$ molecules per second per transporter because each transport cycle requires a full conformational change.\n\nNow match to the observations:\n\n- Protein X shows a rate directly proportional to concentration from $0$ to the highest tested concentration, with no sign of saturation, and an observed rate near $10^{7}$ molecules per second per protein at the high end. This linearity across the tested range and the large turnover are hallmark features of a channel.\n\n- Protein Y shows a rate that increases at low substrate but approaches a plateau at higher concentrations (above a characteristic concentration), with a maximum near $10^{3}$ molecules per second per protein. The saturable kinetics and low turnover are characteristic of a carrier following Michaelis–Menten behavior.\n\nTherefore, Protein X is most consistent with a channel protein, and Protein Y with a carrier protein.\n\nEliminations:\n- Option A reverses the identities, contradicting both the kinetic forms and turnover magnitudes.\n- Option C is incompatible because Protein Y displays saturation typical of carriers.\n- Option D is incompatible because Protein X shows no saturation and has a channel-like turnover rate.\n- Option E is incompatible with the stated facilitated diffusion mechanism and also mismatches Protein X’s kinetics; primary active transport would be saturable and energy-coupled, not simply proportional across the range.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that Protein X is a channel protein and Protein Y is a carrier protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2315820"}, {"introduction": "Now that we can identify carriers by their saturable kinetics, let's explore how they operate within the dynamic environment of a living cell. This exercise uses the biologically crucial example of glucose transport into red blood cells to demonstrate a key principle: facilitated diffusion is driven by the *effective* concentration gradient. You will analyze how cellular metabolism can create and maintain a steep gradient, ensuring a continuous influx of nutrients even when external concentrations might suggest equilibrium [@problem_id:2295115].", "problem": "Facilitated diffusion is a crucial process for transporting molecules across cell membranes. In humans, the transport of glucose into Red Blood Cells (RBCs) is mediated by a carrier protein known as GLUT1. This protein binds to glucose on one side of the membrane, undergoes a conformational change, and releases it on the other side. The net direction of transport is dictated by the concentration gradient of the transported molecule.\n\nConsider two distinct scenarios involving human RBCs placed in a large volume of blood plasma with a stable glucose concentration of 5.0 mM.\n\n**Scenario 1:** An experimentally prepared RBC in which all metabolic activity has been completely inhibited. The internal concentration of free glucose within this cell has equilibrated and is measured to be 5.0 mM.\n\n**Scenario 2:** A normal, metabolically active RBC. In this cell, the enzyme hexokinase immediately and rapidly phosphorylates any glucose molecule that enters the cytoplasm, converting it into glucose-6-phosphate.

Using the aquaporin water channel as a model, this thought experiment examines the critical role that specific amino acid residues play in allowing water to pass while blocking protons. This problem highlights the profound link between a protein's three-dimensional structure, its specific function, and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis [@problem_id:2315801].", "problem": "Aquaporins are channel proteins embedded in cell membranes that facilitate the rapid transport of water molecules. A critical feature of aquaporins is their high selectivity, allowing water to pass while strictly excluding protons (H$^{+}$). This selectivity is crucial for maintaining the proton electrochemical gradients essential for cellular processes like ATP synthesis. The primary mechanism for this proton exclusion involves two highly conserved asparagine residues located in what is known as the NPA (Asparagine-Proline-Alanine) motif. These asparagine side chains project into the channel's narrowest point, forming specific hydrogen bonds that disrupt the continuous chain of water molecules (a \"proton wire\") required for proton translocation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a genetic mutation causes all aquaporin channels in a typical animal cell to have these two critical asparagine residues replaced by glycine residues. The cell is in a standard physiological buffer with a pH of 7.4, while its internal cytosolic pH is normally maintained at 7.2. Which of the following describes the most immediate and significant physiological consequence for this cell?\n\nA. The rate of water transport through the channel will increase dramatically, causing the cell to swell and burst.\n\nB. The cell's cytosol will become more alkaline (basic) as the mutated channels begin to actively pump protons out of the cell.\n\nC. The membrane will become hyperpolarized as the mutated channels allow a net efflux of positive ions from the cell.\n\nD. The proton gradient across the cell membrane will begin to collapse, leading to acidification of the cytosol.\n\nE. The channel will become completely non-functional and impermeable to all molecules, including water.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct physiological consequence of mutating two key asparagine residues in an aquaporin channel to glycine residues.\n\n1.  **Analyze the function of the wild-type aquaporin:** The problem states that aquaporins facilitate water transport while excluding protons. The mechanism for proton exclusion involves two specific asparagine (Asn) residues. The side chain of asparagine is polar and contains an amide group ($-\\text{CONH}_2$) capable of forming hydrogen bonds. These asparagine residues force a water molecule in the center of the pore to reorient, breaking the hydrogen-bonded \"proton wire\" (Grotthuss mechanism) and thus preventing H$^{+}$ (or more accurately, H$_3$O$^{+}$) from passing through.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mutation:** The asparagine residues are replaced by glycine (Gly) residues. Glycine is the simplest amino acid; its side chain is just a single hydrogen atom. Unlike asparagine, glycine's side chain is very small and nonpolar, and it cannot form the specific hydrogen bonds that the asparagine side chain can.\n\n3.  **Determine the effect of the mutation on channel function:** By replacing asparagine with glycine, the specific structural element responsible for proton exclusion is removed. The channel remains an open pore, but it loses its refined selectivity. Protons ($H^+$), which are similar in size to water molecules, are no longer actively repelled. Therefore, they can now move through the channel, driven by their electrochemical gradient.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the direction of proton movement:** The problem states the external pH is 7.4 and the internal (cytosolic) pH is 7.2. A lower pH value indicates a higher concentration of protons. Therefore, the proton concentration inside the cell ($[H^+]_{\\text{in}}$) is higher than outside the cell ($[H^+]_{\\text{out}}$). However, in a typical animal cell, there is a large negative-inside membrane potential (around -70 mV). This strong electrical gradient drives positive ions, including protons, *into* the cell, and this driving force is much stronger than the small opposing concentration gradient suggested by the pH values. More generally, respiration and other metabolic processes maintain a significant electrochemical proton gradient with a net tendency for protons to enter the cell. The problem statement's core is the maintenance of this gradient, which implies a net inward driving force. Therefore, when the channel's proton gate is broken, protons will flow down their electrochemical gradient into the cell.\n\n5.  **Assess the physiological consequence:** The influx of $H^{+}$ into the cytosol will increase the proton concentration inside the cell. An increase in $[H^+]$ corresponds to a decrease in pH, making the cytosol more acidic. This process is referred to as the collapse or dissipation of the proton gradient and leads to cytosolic acidification. This directly corresponds to option D.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **A:** Replacing a larger residue (asparagine) with a smaller one (glycine) might alter water transport rates, but it is not the primary and most significant consequence. The idea that it would cause the cell to burst is an unsubstantiated secondary effect. The loss of proton selectivity is a much more direct and critical failure.\n    *   **B:** The mutation makes the channel a passive pore; it does not grant it the ability to actively pump protons. Protons will flow down their electrochemical gradient (into the cell), causing acidification, not alkalinization.\n    *   **C:** Hyperpolarization means the membrane potential becomes more negative. The influx of positive charges (protons) will do the opposite; it will depolarize the membrane, making the potential less negative.\n    *   **E:** Glycine is the smallest amino acid. Replacing asparagine with glycine would not block the channel. The pore would remain open, but would become less selective. Therefore, it would not become impermeable to water.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the most accurate and immediate consequence is the loss of proton exclusion, leading to a proton leak into the cell and subsequent acidification of the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2315801"}]}
