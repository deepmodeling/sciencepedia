A hydropathy plot is a crucial first step in this process, helping to form a hypothesis about a protein's location and function within the cell. This exercise challenges you to identify the primary goal of this bioinformatic analysis, a fundamental skill in modern molecular biology [@problem_id:2319801].", "problem": "A cell biology researcher discovers a new, uncharacterized protein, which they name \"Xenofascin,\" encoded by a gene in an extremophilic archaeon. After determining the primary amino-acid sequence of Xenofascin, the researcher's first step is to input this sequence into a computational tool that generates a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot. The plot displays the average hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues in a sliding window along the entire length of the polypeptide chain. What is the primary and most immediate question the researcher is trying to answer by performing this specific analysis?\n\nA. To determine the protein's precise three-dimensional folded conformation in an aqueous solution.\n\nB. To predict potential transmembrane domains, suggesting whether the protein is an integral membrane protein.\n\nC. To calculate the protein's isoelectric point (pI) and overall net charge at physiological pH.\n\nD. To identify the specific amino acid residues that will form the active site for potential enzymatic function.\n\nE. To locate the positions of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation or phosphorylation sites.", "solution": "The Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot assigns each amino acid a hydropathy index and computes a sliding-window average along the primary sequence to reveal contiguous stretches of high hydrophobicity. Formally, if the primary sequence is $a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}$ and each residue $a_{i}$ has a hydropathy value $h(a_{i})$, then for a window of width $w$ centered at position $i$, the averaged hydropathy can be written as\n$$\nH_{i}=\\frac{1}{w}\\sum_{j=i-(w-1)/2}^{i+(w-1)/2} h(a_{j}),\n$$\nwith appropriate handling at the sequence ends. The physical principle is that integral membrane proteins often contain transmembrane $\\alpha$ helices that are predominantly hydrophobic over a contiguous stretch of residues, typically long enough to span the lipid bilayer. Thus, detecting a sustained region where $H_{i}$ remains high over a contiguous segment is diagnostic for potential transmembrane domains.\n\nApplying this reasoning to each option:\n- Option A is incorrect because a hydropathy plot does not resolve precise three-dimensional structure; it only reports local hydrophobicity trends along the sequence.\n- Option B is correct because the primary and most immediate goal of generating a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot is to identify long hydrophobic segments that likely correspond to transmembrane domains, thereby suggesting whether the protein is an integral membrane protein.\n- Option C is incorrect because the isoelectric point and net charge require residue pKa and charge-state information, not hydropathy averaging.\n- Option D is incorrect because active site identification requires structural or motif information; hydropathy alone cannot pinpoint specific catalytic residues.\n- Option E is incorrect because post-translational modification sites are typically predicted from sequence motifs and structural context, not from hydropathy profiles.\n\nTherefore, the analysis primarily addresses whether the protein contains transmembrane domains, indicating it may be an integral membrane protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2319801"}, {"introduction": "Once a potential transmembrane segment is identified, we can make quantitative estimates about its structure and fit within the lipid bilayer. The alpha-helix is the most common secondary structure for transmembrane domains, and it has well-defined geometric properties. This practice asks you to apply a simple calculation to connect the number of amino acids in a helix to the physical thickness of the membrane it spans, grounding abstract sequence data in physical reality [@problem_id:2319757].", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is investigating a newly discovered integral membrane protein, which they have named \"Porin-X\". This protein is found in the outer membrane of a specific bacterium and has a total length of 412 amino acids. Detailed structural analysis has revealed that Porin-X contains a single, continuous segment that fully traverses the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. This transmembrane segment is composed of 29 amino acids that adopt a stable $\\alpha$-helical conformation. For a typical $\\alpha$-helix, the axial distance contributed by each amino acid residue, known as the rise per residue, is approximately $0.15$ nm. Based on the length of this single transmembrane $\\alpha$-helix, estimate the thickness of the hydrophobic core of the bacterial membrane.\n\nExpress your answer in nanometers (nm), rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We are told that Porin-X has a single, continuous transmembrane segment of $29$ amino acids that adopts an $\\alpha$-helical conformation. For an $\\alpha$-helix, the axial rise per residue is approximately $0.15$ nm. The physical principle used is that the length of an ideal, straight $\\alpha$-helix is the product of the number of residues and the rise per residue. Because the helix fully traverses the hydrophobic core, this length estimates the hydrophobic core thickness.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of residues in the helix and $a$ be the rise per residue.

This problem shifts our focus to peripheral membrane proteins, which associate with the membrane dynamically through specific interactions. You will be challenged to think like a protein designer, proposing a mutation that alters a protein's recruitment mechanism from conditional to constitutive by manipulating fundamental electrostatic forces [@problem_id:2319730].", "problem": "In a typical signal transduction pathway, a peripheral membrane protein called Signal Transducer Zeta (STZ) is recruited to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This recruitment is temporary and occurs only upon cell stimulation. The mechanism involves the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on an integral membrane receptor, creating a phosphotyrosine (pY) docking site. The Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain of STZ then specifically binds to this pY site, localizing STZ to the membrane to propagate the signal. The inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is known to have a net negative charge due to a high concentration of phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine.\n\nA researcher aims to create a mutant version of STZ that binds to the plasma membrane constitutively, that is, without the requirement for receptor phosphorylation. The mutation will be a single amino acid substitution within the pY-binding pocket of STZ's SH2 domain. Given your knowledge of amino acid properties and protein-membrane interactions, which of the following single point mutations is most likely to achieve this goal?\n\nA. R88D (Arginine at position 88 to Aspartate)\n\nB. G102R (Glycine at position 102 to Arginine)\n\nC. L95F (Leucine at position 95 to Phenylalanine)\n\nD. T110E (Threonine at position 110 to Glutamate)\n\nE. V75A (Valine at position 75 to Alanine)", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the mechanistic goal. The aim is to make STZ associate with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane constitutively, i.e., without dependence on a phosphotyrosine ligand. The inner leaflet carries a net negative charge due to anionic lipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositides. Therefore, mutations that increase localized positive charge on the protein surface can promote electrostatic attraction to the membrane and drive constitutive membrane association.\n\nStep 2: Apply the relevant physical principle. Electrostatic interactions between positively charged amino acid side chains (especially lysine and arginine, with arginine’s guanidinium group being particularly effective at binding phosphates) and negatively charged lipid headgroups promote membrane binding. Conversely, introducing negatively charged residues would disfavor interaction with the negatively charged membrane. Introducing only hydrophobic or small neutral changes in a single residue within a pocket not designed for membrane insertion is unlikely to create sufficient membrane affinity.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each proposed single-residue substitution with respect to its effect on net local charge and membrane affinity.\n- Option A (R88D): Replaces a positively charged arginine with a negatively charged aspartate. This reduces positive charge and introduces negative charge, which would weaken both potential electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids and canonical pY binding. This change is counter to the goal.\n- Option B (G102R): Replaces glycine with arginine, adding a positively charged, membrane-phosphate-binding side chain. This increases local positive charge in the SH2 pocket region, creating a basic patch capable of electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged inner leaflet, thereby promoting constitutive membrane association independent of receptor phosphorylation.\n- Option C (L95F): Substitutes a hydrophobic residue with another hydrophobic residue. This does not add positive charge and is unlikely, as a single change in a pocket residue, to generate sufficient hydrophobic membrane insertion. It does not accomplish constitutive electrostatic recruitment.\n- Option D (T110E): Introduces a negatively charged glutamate, which would be electrostatically repelled by the negatively charged inner leaflet and thus reduce membrane affinity.\n- Option E (V75A): A conservative hydrophobic-to-hydrophobic size reduction. This has minimal effect on charge and would not drive constitutive membrane association.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the optimal choice. The only mutation that directly increases positive charge to promote electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged inner leaflet is G102R, making Option B the most likely to achieve constitutive membrane binding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2319730"}]}
