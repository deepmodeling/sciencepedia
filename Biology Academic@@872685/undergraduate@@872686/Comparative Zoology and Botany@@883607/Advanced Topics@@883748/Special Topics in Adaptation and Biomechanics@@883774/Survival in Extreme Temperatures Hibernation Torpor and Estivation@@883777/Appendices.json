This process involves a significant reduction in metabolic rate. However, arousing from torpor is an energetically expensive process that can offset some of the savings.\n\nConsider an insectivorous bat with mass $m$. The bat's physiology is characterized by the following metabolic rates, measured in volume of oxygen consumed per unit mass per unit time:\n- Active metabolic rate (euthermic): $R_{active}$\n- Torpid metabolic rate: $R_{torpid}$\n- Arousal metabolic rate (average rate during the rewarming process): $R_{arousal}$\n\nThe bat undergoes a daily cycle that includes a torpor bout of duration $t_{torpor}$, immediately followed by a rapid rewarming period of duration $t_{arousal}$ to return to its active state. The energy released per unit volume of oxygen consumed is a constant value, $C$, known as the oxycaloric equivalent.\n\nDerive a single, closed-form analytic expression for the net energy savings, $\\Delta E_{net}$, achieved by the bat during the total period ($t_{torpor} + t_{arousal}$) compared to what it would have expended if it had remained active (euthermic) for that same total duration.

A key challenge of this strategy is the periodic arousal, where the animal must rapidly warm its entire body mass back to a normal active temperature using only its own metabolic heat.\n\nConsider a simplified biophysical model to investigate how the time required for this rewarming process scales with body size.

Upon the arrival of spring, each marmot must decide between two strategies for emerging from hibernation: \"Arouse Early\" or \"Arouse Late\". The choice of strategy affects an individual's evolutionary fitness, which is influenced by resource availability and predation risk in a frequency-dependent manner.\n\nLet $p$ be the fraction of the population that adopts the \"Arouse Early\" strategy.

However, they benefit from a reduction in predation risk as more of their peers also arouse early (a \"safety in numbers\" effect). The fitness cost from predation for an Early Arouser is given by $C_P - Vp$, where $C_P$ is the maximum predation cost experienced by a solitary early individual and $V$ is a coefficient representing the vigilance benefit from the group.\n- **Late Arousers**: These individuals avoid the initial metabolic cost $C_E$. However, they face increased competition for resources that have been partially depleted by the early cohort. This manifests as a fitness cost proportional to the fraction of Early Arousers, given by $C_R p$, where $C_R$ is the resource competition coefficient.
