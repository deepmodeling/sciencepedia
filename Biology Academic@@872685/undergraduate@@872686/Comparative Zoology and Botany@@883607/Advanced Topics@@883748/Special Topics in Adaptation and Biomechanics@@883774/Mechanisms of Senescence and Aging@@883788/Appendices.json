This exercise [@problem_id:1756064] invites you to build a kinetic model that describes the balance between protein damage and repair. By applying this model to an active leaf cell and a dormant seed cell, you will quantitatively explore how drastically reduced metabolic rates can confer extraordinary longevity, providing a mechanistic explanation for phenomena like the germination of ancient seeds.", "problem": "The remarkable longevity of certain seeds, such as the ancient lotus seed recovered from a dry lakebed in China that was successfully germinated after over a thousand years, points to powerful anti-aging mechanisms. These mechanisms operate at the cellular level, primarily by minimizing the accumulation of molecular damage over long periods of dormancy.\n\nLet's explore this phenomenon with a simplified biophysical model for cellular aging. We will model aging as the accumulation of damaged proteins within a cell. Assume the total number of proteins in a cell, $N_T$, remains constant. Let $D(t)$ be the number of damaged proteins at time $t$. The number of functional proteins is therefore $N_T - D(t)$.\n\nThe dynamics of protein damage and repair are governed by the following rules:\n1.  The rate at which functional proteins become damaged is proportional to the number of functional proteins, with a rate constant $k_d$.\n2.  The rate at which damaged proteins are repaired or cleared from the cell is proportional to the number of damaged proteins, with a rate constant $k_r$.\n3.  A cell is considered to have reached the end of its viable lifespan when the fraction of damaged proteins, $f(t) = D(t)/N_T$, reaches a critical threshold $f_c$.\n\nAssume that at time $t=0$, cells are in a pristine state with no damaged proteins.\n\nConsider two types of plant cells:\n-   An **active leaf cell**, which is metabolically active. Its damage and repair rate constants are:\n    $k_{d, \\text{active}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n    $k_{r, \\text{active}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n-   A **dormant seed cell**, which has a drastically reduced metabolic rate. Its rate constants are:\n    $k_{d, \\text{seed}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n    $k_{r, \\text{seed}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n\nThe critical threshold for senescence in both cell types is $f_c = 0.60$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the lifespan of the dormant seed cell ($T_{\\text{seed}}$) to the lifespan of the active leaf cell ($T_{\\text{active}}$). Give your answer as a real number, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the lifespans of two types of cells based on a model of protein damage and repair. Let $D(t)$ be the number of damaged proteins at time $t$, and $N_T$ be the total number of proteins.\n\nFirst, we establish the differential equation for the number of damaged proteins, $D(t)$.\nThe rate of increase of damaged proteins is the rate of damage minus the rate of repair.\nRate of damage = $k_d \\times (\\text{number of functional proteins}) = k_d (N_T - D(t))$.\nRate of repair = $k_r \\times (\\text{number of damaged proteins}) = k_r D(t)$.\n\nThe net rate of change of damaged proteins is:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_d (N_T - D(t)) - k_r D(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_d N_T - (k_d + k_r) D(t) $$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by rearranging the terms:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} + (k_d + k_r) D(t) = k_d N_T $$\nThis equation is of the form $y' + P(t)y = Q(t)$, where $y=D(t)$, $P(t) = k_d+k_r$, and $Q(t) = k_d N_T$.\nThe solution for $D(t)$ with the initial condition $D(0) = 0$ is:\n$$ D(t) = \\frac{k_d N_T}{k_d + k_r} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(k_d + k_r)t\\right)\\right) $$\n\nThe problem defines the fraction of damaged proteins as $f(t) = D(t)/N_T$. Dividing the expression for $D(t)$ by $N_T$, we get:\n$$ f(t) = \\frac{k_d}{k_d + k_r} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(k_d + k_r)t\\right)\\right) $$\nThe term $\\frac{k_d}{k_d + k_r}$ is the steady-state fraction of damaged proteins, which we denote as $f_{ss}$.\n$$ f_{ss} = \\frac{k_d}{k_d + k_r} $$\nSo the equation for $f(t)$ becomes:\n$$ f(t) = f_{ss} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(k_d + k_r)t\\right)\\right) $$\n\nThe lifespan, $T$, is the time at which $f(t)$ reaches the critical threshold $f_c$.
