Consider a simplified model of two symbiotic gut microbes, which we will call Microbe 1 and Microbe 2. They live as a pair and depend on a specific digestive enzyme to process nutrients. Each microbe has two possible strategies: 'Produce', where it synthesizes the enzyme, or 'Free-ride', where it does not.\n\nThe rules for fitness payoffs are as follows:\n- Producing the enzyme incurs a fitness cost of $c$ to the individual producer.\n- The enzyme is a \"public good.\" When one unit of the enzyme is produced by either microbe, both microbes in the pair experience a fitness benefit of $b$.\n- The benefits are additive. If both microbes choose 'Produce', two units of the enzyme are created, and each microbe receives a total fitness benefit of $2b$.\n- The interaction is a social dilemma, characterized by the condition $b < c < 2b$.\n\nYour task is to determine the fitness payoff for Microbe 1 for all four possible combinations of strategies. Present your answer as a single row matrix containing the four payoffs. The payoffs must be ordered corresponding to the following scenarios:\n1.  Microbe 1 chooses 'Produce', Microbe 2 chooses 'Produce'.\n2.  Microbe 1 chooses 'Produce', Microbe 2 chooses 'Free-ride'.\n3.  Microbe 1 chooses 'Free-ride', Microbe 2 chooses 'Produce'.\n4.

This concept, known as inclusive fitness, is mathematically captured by Hamilton's Rule, which states that an altruistic trait can evolve if the benefit to the recipient ($B$), weighted by the genetic relatedness ($r$) between the individuals, exceeds the cost to the altruist ($C$), or $rB > C$. This practice [@problem_id:1748827] provides a concrete scenario to apply this powerful rule, allowing you to calculate the net fitness change of an altruistic act and determine if natural selection would favor it.", "problem": "In the high-altitude meadows of a remote mountain range, a species of social mammal known as the Ridgefoot Marmot lives in small, genetically-related colonies. When a predator, such as a hawk, is spotted, an individual marmot can choose to emit a piercing alarm call. This call alerts other colony members to seek shelter in their burrows, but it also draws the predator's attention to the caller.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, this behavior can be analyzed using the concept of inclusive fitness. Let's quantify the trade-off in abstract \"fitness units\".\nThe fitness cost to the individual that makes the alarm call is $C = 2.0$ units.\nThe fitness benefit gained by each individual that hears the call and successfully escapes is $B = 5.0$ units.\n\nConsider a scenario where a single marmot spots a hawk. The only other marmots close enough to hear the call are three of its first cousins. The coefficient of relatedness between first cousins in this species, which represents the probability that a gene is shared by common descent, is $r = 0.125$.\n\nCalculate the net change in the caller's inclusive fitness if it chooses to make the alarm call. Express your answer in fitness units as a single real number.", "solution": "We analyze the decision using inclusive fitness. The net change in the caller’s inclusive fitness from making the alarm call equals the sum of relatedness-weighted benefits to others minus the direct cost to the caller. Denote the cost by $C$, the per-recipient benefit by $B$, and the coefficient of relatedness to each recipient by $r$. If there are $n$ recipients, the net change is\n$$\n\\Delta W = -C + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{i} B_{i}.\n$$\nIn this case, $n=3$, and all recipients are first cousins with the same relatedness $r=0.125$, each receiving the same benefit $B=5.0$.

This can lead to a stable equilibrium where multiple behavioral strategies coexist, known as a mixed Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS).

They each have two choices: go to a single, large Oasis or to the surrounding sparse Scrubland, which contains numerous isolated foraging patches.\n\nThe total energy gain from the Oasis is a constant `H`. The energy gain from a single patch in the Scrubland is a constant `L`. The following rules determine the energy payoff for each fox:\n1.  If both foxes choose the Scrubland, they forage in separate patches, and each gains `L` units of energy.\n2.  If one fox chooses the Oasis and the other chooses the Scrubland, the fox at the Oasis obtains all its resources, gaining `H` energy, while the fox in the Scrubland gains `L` energy.\n3.  If both foxes choose the Oasis, they must compete. They divide the resources equally, but the conflict itself costs each fox an amount of energy `c`. Thus, each fox's net energy gain is `H/2 - c`.\n\nThe scenario is interesting when the Oasis is richer than a scrubland patch (`H > L`), but sharing the Oasis is less profitable than having a scrubland patch to oneself (`H/2 - c < L`). Assume these conditions hold. In a large population of such foxes where individuals are randomly paired for this foraging game, the population can evolve to a stable state where both strategies (choosing the Oasis and choosing the Scrubland) coexist.\n\nDetermine the equilibrium fraction of the fox population that chooses to forage at the Oasis. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of `H`, `L`, and `c`.", "solution": "This problem can be analyzed using the framework of evolutionary game theory. We have two players (the foxes) and two strategies: \"Oasis\" and \"Scrubland\". We first need to construct the payoff matrix, which represents the energy gain for Player 1 (row player) given the strategy of Player 2 (column player).\n\nLet's denote the payoff to a player as `Payoff(Strategy1, Strategy2)`, where `Strategy1` is the player's own strategy and `Strategy2` is the opponent's strategy.\n\nFrom the problem description:\n- If Player 1 chooses \"Oasis\" and Player 2 also chooses \"Oasis\", the payoff is `H/2 - c`. So, `Payoff(Oasis, Oasis) = H/2 - c`.\n- If Player 1 chooses \"Oasis\" and Player 2 chooses \"Scrubland\", the payoff is `H`. So, `Payoff(Oasis, Scrubland) = H`.\n- If Player 1 chooses \"Scrubland\" and Player 2 chooses \"Oasis\", the payoff is `L`. So, `Payoff(Scrubland, Oasis) = L`.\n- If Player 1 chooses \"Scrubland\" and Player 2 also chooses \"Scrubland\", the payoff is `L`. So, `Payoff(Scrubland, Scrubland) = L`.\n\nWe can summarize this in a payoff matrix for Player 1:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n\\text{Player 1} & \\text{Player 2: Oasis} & \\text{Player 2: Scrubland} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Oasis} & H/2 - c & H \\\\\n\\text{Scrubland} & L & L \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that an evolutionarily stable mixed-strategy equilibrium exists where both strategies coexist. This occurs when the expected payoff (or fitness) for an individual choosing the \"Oasis\" strategy is equal to the expected payoff for an individual choosing the \"Scrubland\" strategy.\n\nLet `p` be the fraction of the population that plays \"Oasis\". Consequently, the fraction of the population that plays \"Scrubland\" is `1-p`.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected payoff for each strategy for an individual playing against a random member of this mixed-population.\n\nThe expected payoff for playing \"Oasis\", `E(Oasis)`, is the sum of the payoffs for playing against an \"Oasis\" player and a \"Scrubland\" player, weighted by their respective frequencies in the population:\n$$ E(\\text{Oasis}) = p \\cdot \\text{Payoff(Oasis, Oasis)} + (1-p) \\cdot \\text{Payoff(Oasis, Scrubland)} $$\nSubstituting the payoff values:\n$$ E(\\text{Oasis}) = p \\left(\\frac{H}{2} - c\\right) + (1-p)H $$\n\nThe expected payoff for playing \"Scrubland\", `E(Scrubland)`, is similarly calculated:\n$$ E(\\text{Scrubland}) = p \\cdot \\text{Payoff(Scrubland, Oasis)} + (1-p) \\cdot \\text{Payoff(Scrubland, Scrubland)} $$\nSubstituting the payoff values:\n$$ E(\\text{Scrubland}) = p \\cdot L + (1-p)L $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ E(\\text{Scrubland}) = L(p + 1 - p) = L $$\n\nAt equilibrium, the expected payoffs must be equal: `E(Oasis) = E(Scrubland)`.\n$$ p \\left(\\frac{H}{2} - c\\right) + (1-p)H = L $$\n\nNow, we solve for `p`:\n$$ p \\frac{H}{2} - pc + H - pH = L $$\nRearrange the equation to isolate terms with `p`:\n$$ H - L = pH - p \\frac{H}{2} + pc $$\nFactor out `p` from the right-hand side:\n$$ H - L = p \\left(H - \\frac{H}{2} + c\\right) $$\n$$ H - L = p \\left(\\frac{H}{2} + c\\right) $$\n\nFinally, we solve for `p`, which is the equilibrium fraction of the population choosing \"Oasis\":\n$$ p = \\frac{H - L}{\\frac{H}{2} + c} $$\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n$$ p = \\frac{2(H - L)}{H + 2c} $$\n\nThe conditions given in the problem, `H > L` and `L > H/2 - c`, ensure that `p` is a valid fraction between 0 and 1. `H > L` ensures the numerator is positive. `L > H/2 - c` is equivalent to `c > H/2 - L`. Let's check the condition `p < 1`:\n`2(H-L) < H+2c`\n`2H - 2L < H + 2c`\n`H - 2L < 2c`\n`H/2 - L < c`, which is equivalent to the given condition `L > H/2 - c`.
