By calculating a simple performance ratio from biomass data, you will gain hands-on experience in interpreting experimental results and linking physiological traits to ecological success.", "problem": "A botanist is investigating a newly discovered species of grass to determine its photosynthetic pathway. To do this, an experiment is conducted using controlled environment chambers. Genetically identical clones of the unknown grass species are grown from seedlings, alongside seedlings of a known C3 plant (wheat, *Triticum aestivum*) and a known C4 plant (maize, *Zea mays*) which serve as controls. All seedlings start with an identical initial dry biomass of $m_0 = 0.50$ grams.\n\nThe seedlings are divided into two groups. The first group is placed in a \"cool\" chamber maintained at a constant temperature of 20°C. The second group is placed in a \"hot\" chamber maintained at 35°C. All other environmental conditions, including light intensity, photoperiod, atmospheric carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) concentration, and nutrient and water availability, are kept optimal and identical for all plants in both chambers.\n\nAfter a growth period of 30 days, the plants are harvested, and their final dry biomass is measured. The results are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Plant Species | Final Dry Biomass in Cool Chamber (20°C) [grams] | Final Dry Biomass in Hot Chamber (35°C) [grams] |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Wheat (C3) | 12.50 | 8.50 |\n| Maize (C4) | 9.50 | 18.50 |\n| Unknown Grass | 10.50 | 16.50 |\n\nTo quantify the effect of temperature on the growth of the unknown species, calculate its Temperature Performance Ratio (TPR). The TPR is defined as the net biomass gained in the hot chamber divided by the net biomass gained in the cool chamber. Report your answer as a dimensionless value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks us to calculate the Temperature Performance Ratio (TPR) for the unknown grass species based on the provided experimental data. The TPR is defined as the ratio of the net biomass gained in the hot chamber to the net biomass gained in the cool chamber.\n\nFirst, let's define the net biomass gain. The net biomass gain, $\\Delta m$, is the final biomass, $m_f$, minus the initial biomass, $m_0$.\n$$ \\Delta m = m_f - m_0 $$\n\nWe need to calculate this for the unknown species in both the cool and hot chambers.

From the table, the final biomass of the unknown grass in the cool chamber is $m_{f, \\text{cool}} = 10.50$ grams.\n$$ \\Delta m_{\\text{cool}} = m_{f, \\text{cool}} - m_0 = 10.50 \\, \\text{g} - 0.50 \\, \\text{g} = 10.00 \\, \\text{g} $$\n\nNext, let $\\Delta m_{\\text{hot}}$ be the net biomass gain for the unknown species in the hot chamber (35°C). From the table, the final biomass of the unknown grass in the hot chamber is $m_{f, \\text{hot}} = 16.50$ grams.\n$$ \\Delta m_{\\text{hot}} = m_{f, \\text{hot}} - m_0 = 16.50 \\, \\text{g} - 0.50 \\, \\text{g} = 16.00 \\, \\text{g} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the Temperature Performance Ratio (TPR) using its definition:\n$$ \\text{TPR} = \\frac{\\Delta m_{\\text{hot}}}{\\Delta m_{\\text{cool}}} $$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ \\text{TPR} = \\frac{16.00 \\, \\text{g}}{10.00 \\, \\text{g}} = 1.60 $$\n\nThe resulting TPR is a dimensionless quantity. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Our calculated value, 1.60, is already in this form.\n\nFor context, let's analyze the TPR values for the control plants.\nFor Wheat (C3):\n$\\Delta m_{\\text{cool}} = 12.50 - 0.50 = 12.00$ g\n$\\Delta m_{\\text{hot}} = 8.50 - 0.50 = 8.00$ g\n$\\text{TPR}_{\\text{Wheat}} = \\frac{8.00}{12.00} \\approx 0.667$\n\nFor Maize (C4):\n$\\Delta m_{\\text{cool}} = 9.50 - 0.50 = 9.00$ g\n$\\Delta m_{\\text{hot}} = 18.50 - 0.50 = 18.00$ g\n$\\text{TPR}_{\\text{Maize}} = \\frac{18.00}{9.00} = 2.00$\n\nThe TPR of the unknown species (1.60) is significantly greater than 1, showing that its growth is enhanced at the higher temperature. This performance profile is very similar to the known C4 plant, maize (TPR = 2.00), and starkly different from the known C3 plant, wheat (TPR $\\approx$ 0.667), whose growth was inhibited by the higher temperature. This inhibition in C3 plants at high temperatures is due to increased photorespiration, a metabolically costly process that C4 plants largely avoid due to their specialized anatomy and biochemical pathway for concentrating $\\text{CO}_2$. The calculated TPR for the unknown species thus provides strong evidence that it utilizes a C4 photosynthetic pathway.
