This exercise explores how an organism's reproductive strategy—in this case, self-pollination versus outcrossing—can profoundly affect the efficiency of natural selection in removing a deleterious TE from the gene pool. This problem bridges the gap between molecular events and their population-level evolutionary consequences [@problem_id:1782719].", "problem": "Two closely related, diploid annual plant species, *Planta autogama* and *Planta allogama*, inhabit similar environments. *P. autogama* is an obligate self-pollinator (it exclusively self-fertilizes), while *P. allogama* is an obligate outcrosser (it must cross-fertilize with another individual). Both species are susceptible to a family of retrotransposons, a type of Transposable Element (TE), which insert themselves randomly into the genome.\n\nSuppose a new TE insertion event occurs in a single individual within a large population of *P. autogama* and, independently, in a single individual within a large population of *P. allogama*. In both cases, the insertion is into a non-critical region, is not immediately lethal, and behaves as a simple Mendelian recessive allele. This means individuals homozygous for the insertion exhibit a reduction in reproductive fitness compared to individuals without the insertion, while individuals heterozygous for the insertion have a fitness identical to the wild type.\n\nBased on the principles of population genetics and the different mating systems, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the long-term fate of this new deleterious TE insertion in the two species?\n\nA. *P. autogama* will purge the TE insertion more effectively because self-pollination rapidly creates homozygous individuals, exposing the deleterious allele to natural selection.\n\nB. *P. allogama* will purge the TE insertion more effectively because outcrossing increases genetic recombination, which helps to separate the TE from any linked beneficial genes.\n\nC. *P. autogama* will purge the TE insertion more effectively because its breeding system prevents the TE from spreading to other individuals through pollen transfer.\n\nD. *P. allogama* will purge the TE insertion more effectively because the deleterious effects are masked in heterozygotes, allowing the population to maintain high fitness while gradually removing the allele.\n\nE. Both species will purge the TE insertion at the same rate because the strength of natural selection against the homozygous recessive genotype is identical in both.", "solution": "To determine which species will be more effective at purging the deleterious transposable element (TE) insertion, we must analyze how each mating system affects the exposure of the recessive allele to natural selection. Let's denote the wild-type allele (no insertion) as `T` and the recessive allele with the TE insertion as `t`. Since the TE insertion is a new mutation in a single individual, this individual is heterozygous (`Tt`). The rest of both populations are homozygous wild-type (`TT`).\n\nStep 1: Analyze the self-pollinating species, *Planta autogama*.\nThe initial individual has the genotype `Tt`. Since this species is an obligate self-pollinator, this individual will self-fertilize (`Tt` x `Tt`). According to Mendelian genetics, the offspring genotypes will be produced in the following ratio:\n- 1/4 `TT` (homozygous wild-type)\n- 1/2 `Tt` (heterozygous)\n- 1/4 `tt` (homozygous for the TE insertion)\n\nCrucially, in the very first generation of reproduction, homozygous recessive (`tt`) individuals are produced. The problem states that individuals with the `tt` genotype have reduced reproductive fitness. Therefore, natural selection can immediately act against these individuals, reducing the frequency of the `t` allele in the next generation. The rapid generation of homozygous genotypes from a heterozygote is a hallmark of self-fertilization.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the outcrossing species, *Planta allogama*.\nThe initial individual also has the genotype `Tt`. Since this species is an obligate outcrosser, this individual must mate with another plant from the population. As the TE insertion is a new mutation, all other individuals in the population are `TT`. The cross is therefore `Tt` x `TT`. The offspring genotypes will be in the following ratio:\n- 1/2 `Tt` (heterozygous)\n- 1/2 `TT` (homozygous wild-type)\n\nIn the first generation, no homozygous recessive (`tt`) individuals are produced. The deleterious `t` allele is \"hidden\" or \"masked\" in the heterozygous `Tt` individuals because its effect is recessive. Natural selection cannot \"see\" the `t` allele in these heterozygotes, as their fitness is identical to the wild-type `TT` individuals. For a `tt` individual to be produced (and for selection to act), the `t` allele must first increase in the population through genetic drift or spread until two heterozygotes (`Tt`) happen to mate. The probability of two `Tt` individuals mating is very low when the frequency of the `t` allele is very low. This process shields the allele from selection, allowing it to persist in the population for many generations.\n\nStep 3: Compare the outcomes and evaluate the options.\n*P. autogama*'s selfing system quickly converts heterozygosity into homozygosity, immediately exposing the deleterious recessive `tt` genotype to negative selection. This makes the purging of the `t` allele highly efficient.\n*P. allogama*'s outcrossing system maintains heterozygosity, masking the deleterious recessive `t` allele from selection. This makes the purging process much slower and less efficient.\n\nTherefore, *P. autogama* will purge the TE insertion more effectively. Let's analyze the given options based on this conclusion.\n\nA. **Correct.** This statement accurately identifies that self-pollination leads to the rapid formation of homozygous individuals, which exposes the recessive deleterious allele to natural selection, leading to more effective purging.\nB. **Incorrect.** While outcrossing does increase genetic recombination, this is not the key factor here. The primary obstacle to purging is the masking of the recessive allele in heterozygotes, which outcrossing promotes.\nC. **Incorrect.** While it's true selfing restricts gene flow, this is not the reason purging is more efficient. The core mechanism is the exposure of the allele to selection via homozygosity, not its containment. An outcrossing population could also purge an allele if it were exposed to selection.\nD. **Incorrect.** This option correctly identifies that the allele is masked in heterozygotes but draws the opposite, incorrect conclusion. Masking the allele *hinders* its purging, it does not make the process more effective.\nE. **Incorrect.** This statement is flawed because it ignores the role of the mating system. While the selection coefficient against the `tt` genotype is the same, the mating system determines the frequency at which this genotype appears in the population and is thus exposed to this selection pressure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1782719"}, {"introduction": "Transposable elements are not just agents of change; they are also a rich fossil record embedded within our genomes. This problem introduces a powerful technique used in paleogenomics: dating the insertion of an ancient endogenous retrovirus (ERV) by measuring the mutational divergence between its two Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs). You will derive a formula to act as a molecular clock, accounting for a realistic scenario where the background mutation rate, $\\mu$, changes over geological time [@problem_id:1782707].", "problem": "A molecular paleontologist is studying genome evolution in an extinct primate, *Cryptopithecus antiquus*. The analysis focuses on dating the insertion of mobile genetic elements known as Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs). When an ERV integrates into the host genome, it is flanked by two identical sequences called Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs), one at the 5' end and one at the 3' end. After insertion, these two LTRs are no longer constrained by selection and accumulate nucleotide substitutions independently at the neutral mutation rate. The measured nucleotide divergence (the fraction of differing sites) between the 5' and 3' LTRs of a single ERV can therefore be used to estimate its time of insertion.\n\nThe paleontologist identifies two specific ERV insertions, `ERV-A` and `ERV-B`, in the *C. antiquus* genome. `ERV-A` is phylogenetically determined to be the older of the two insertions. The nucleotide divergence between the LTRs of `ERV-A` is measured to be $K_A$, and for `ERV-B` it is $K_B$.\n\nStudies of this primate's lineage show that the neutral mutation rate, $\\mu$, was not constant over time. It is strongly correlated with metabolic activity, which in turn was driven by major paleoclimatic shifts. From the time of `ERV-A`'s insertion, $t_A$, until the time of `ERV-B`'s insertion, $t_B$, the climate was stable, resulting in a constant neutral mutation rate of $\\mu_1$. Following a major climate event at time $t_B$, the mutation rate changed to a new constant value, $\\mu_2$, which persisted until the time the organism lived (considered the \"present\", $t=0$).\n\nDerive an analytical expression for the insertion time of the older element, $t_A$ (in years before present), in terms of the measured divergences $K_A$, $K_B$, and the mutation rates $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$.", "solution": "When an ERV inserts, its two LTRs are identical.
