By considering how a population of salmon adapts after becoming permanently landlocked, we can explore the fundamental definition of relaxed selection. This exercise helps build intuition for how environmental changes directly alter the evolutionary pressures acting on different sets of genes, distinguishing between those that remain essential and those that become obsolete. [@problem_id:1772867]", "problem": "Anadromous fish, such as salmon, have a remarkable life cycle that involves migrating from their freshwater birthplace to the ocean to mature, and then returning to freshwater to reproduce. This dual-habitat life requires two distinct and complex sets of physiological machinery for osmoregulation. In freshwater, which is hypotonic to the fish's body fluids, the fish must actively uptake salts from the environment and excrete a large volume of dilute urine to combat the constant influx of water. In the ocean, which is hypertonic, the fish must drink seawater, actively excrete excess salts through specialized cells in its gills, and produce minimal, concentrated urine to conserve water.\n\nConsider a large, genetically diverse population of salmon that becomes permanently trapped in a vast, stable freshwater lake after a geological event (e.g., a landslide) blocks their migratory route to the sea. Over many generations, this population successfully establishes itself as a self-sustaining, purely freshwater species.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary evolutionary pressure acting on the two sets of osmoregulatory genes (one for saltwater adaptation, one for freshwater adaptation) in this now landlocked population?\n\nA. The genes for saltwater osmoregulation will be under relaxed selection, as the functions they encode are no longer required and maintaining them incurs a metabolic cost without providing any fitness benefit.\n\nB. The genes for freshwater osmoregulation will be under relaxed selection, as the stable, predictable environment of the lake is less osmotically challenging than a variable river system.\n\nC. Both the freshwater and saltwater osmoregulatory gene sets will be under intensified purifying selection, as the fish must fine-tune their physiology to the specific ionic composition of their new, permanent home.\n\nD. Both sets of genes will be under disruptive selection, favoring individuals at the extremes of either high-salt or low-salt tolerance to exploit different micro-niches within the lake.\n\nE. All genes related to osmoregulation will become effectively neutral, as the primary selective pressures will shift entirely to foraging and avoiding predation in the new lacustrine environment.", "solution": "Key evolutionary principle: selection acts on variation affecting fitness in the prevailing environment. When a trait no longer contributes to fitness because its associated environment is absent, its underlying genes experience relaxed selection; deleterious mutations are no longer efficiently purged, and costs of maintaining unused machinery can favor reduction or loss. Conversely, genes essential for survival in the current environment remain under purifying selection to maintain function.\n\nApplication to the scenario:\n- In the ocean, anadromous salmon require saltwater osmoregulation (drinking seawater, active ion excretion through gill chloride cells, concentrated urine). In permanent freshwater isolation, that functionality provides no fitness benefit because saltwater is never encountered.\n- Maintaining the saltwater program entails costs (e.g., transcription/translation, regulatory maintenance, potential pleiotropic side effects). Without benefits, selection no longer favors its retention; therefore, variants that reduce or disable the saltwater pathway will not be selected against unless they harm freshwater performance. This is the definition of relaxed selection and often leads to pseudogenization via drift or even positive selection for loss if expression is costly.\n- Freshwater osmoregulation remains essential (active ion uptake, dilute urine production), so mutations impairing these functions reduce fitness and are removed by purifying selection, not relaxed selection.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A correctly identifies relaxed selection on saltwater osmoregulatory genes due to loss of use and cost without benefit.\n- B is incorrect: freshwater osmoregulation remains necessary; a stable lake does not eliminate osmotic challenges.\n- C is incorrect: saltwater genes would not be under intensified purifying selection when unused.\n- D is unlikely: disruptive selection on salt tolerance requires distinct fitness peaks within the lake; here, the key axis (marine vs freshwater) has collapsed to a single regime.\n- E is incorrect: osmoregulation is still vital in freshwater; those genes are not neutral.\n\nTherefore, the primary evolutionary pressure is relaxed selection on the saltwater osmoregulatory gene set, while freshwater genes remain under purifying selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1772867"}, {"introduction": "Having established the concept of relaxed selection, we can now build a quantitative model to predict its consequences over time.

A new, isolated population of this species colonizes a windy archipelago where bees are absent. Over time, this population evolves to rely exclusively on wind for pollination. Consequently, the selective pressures that previously maintained the genes for bee-attracting traits are relaxed, and these genes begin to accumulate loss-of-function mutations.\n\nWe will model the genetic decay of these two traits with the following assumptions:\n\n1.  **Nectar Production:** The biosynthesis of nectar is controlled by a simple linear metabolic pathway requiring $N_n = 4$ essential enzymes, each encoded by a distinct gene. A loss-of-function mutation in any one of these genes is sufficient to completely halt nectar production, making the trait non-functional.\n2.  **Floral Coloration:** The vibrant color is due to the combined effect of pigments produced by $N_p = 3$ independent genes. The loss of visual attractiveness (i.e., the functional loss of the coloration trait) is considered to have occurred only when all three of these genes have independently acquired loss-of-function mutations.\n\nFor any single gene in either pathway, the probability of a new loss-of-function mutation occurring in a single generation is $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$.
