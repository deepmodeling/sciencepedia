They have successfully sequenced a short fragment of a mitochondrial gene and wish to compare it to the homologous sequence from its closest living relative, the Asian elephant (*Elephas maximus*).\n\nA common form of post-mortem damage to ancient DNA is cytosine deamination. This chemical process results in a cytosine (C) base being misinterpreted as a thymine (T) during sequencing. On the complementary DNA strand, this same process causes a guanine (G) base to be misinterpreted as an adenine (A).\n\nBelow are the two aligned DNA sequences. The \"Modern DNA\" is from the Asian elephant, and the \"Ancient DNA\" is the sequence recovered from the woolly mammoth.\n\nModern DNA Sequence:\n`AGCTGACCGATTAGGCCATGACTACGTACGGGCTATACGTCGTAG`\n\nAncient DNA Sequence:\n`AACTTACGGAATAGGTTAATGACTACGTAAGGGCTATTCGTAAGTAG`\n\nHow many of the observed nucleotide differences between the ancient and modern sequences are characteristic of post-mortem cytosine deamination, as described?", "solution": "We need to count the nucleotide differences that match the signatures of cytosine deamination: a cytosine (C) in the modern DNA appearing as a thymine (T) in the ancient DNA ($C \\to T$), or a guanine (G) appearing as an adenine (A) ($G \\to A$). This requires aligning the sequences. The shared substring `GACTACGTA` serves as a reliable anchor.\n\n1.  **Align sequences around the anchor:**\n    *   **Prefix (before anchor):**\n        *   Modern:  `AGCTGACCGATTAGGCCAT`\n        *   Ancient: `AACTTACGGAATAGGTTAA` (plus an insertion `T` before the anchor)\n    *   **Suffix (after anchor):**\n        *   Modern:  `CGGGCTATACGTCGTAG`\n        *   Ancient: `AGGGCTATTCGTAAGTAG`\n\n2.  **Count deamination events in the Prefix:**\n    By comparing the prefix sequences position by position, we find three differences matching the pattern:\n    *   Position 2: Modern `G` -> Ancient `A`.

This practice demonstrates how to infer the biological sex of an ancient specimen using shotgun sequencing data. The method relies on a simple but powerful principle: the relative number of DNA sequences mapping to the X and Y chromosomes reflects their dosage in the genome.", "problem": "A team of paleogeneticists is analyzing a 50,000-year-old Neanderthal bone fragment discovered in a Siberian cave. They successfully extract and sequence ancient Deoxyribonucleic Acid (aDNA) from the specimen using a method called shotgun sequencing. This process generates millions of short DNA sequences, or \"reads,\" which are then computationally aligned to a reference genome to determine their chromosomal origin.\n\nThe analysis of the sequencing data yields the following key results:\n1.  A large number of reads are successfully mapped to the X chromosome. The quantity of these reads is comparable to what would be expected for an autosome (a non-sex chromosome) of a similar size.\n2.  The number of reads that uniquely map to the Y chromosome is statistically insignificant and falls within the background noise level expected from sequencing errors or misalignment.\n\nBased on this genomic evidence alone, what is the most likely conclusion about the biological sex of this Neanderthal individual?\n\nA. Male\n\nB. Female\n\nC. The sex is undeterminable because the Y chromosome is naturally much smaller than the X chromosome, so it is expected to yield very few reads.\n\nD. The data is inconclusive, as the absence of Y chromosome reads is likely due to sample contamination from a modern female in the lab.", "solution": "Shotgun sequencing produces a number of reads mapping to a chromosome that is, in expectation, proportional to the chromosome’s copy number and length. Let $R_{j}$ denote the expected read count mapping to chromosome $j$, $n_{j}$ its copy number, and $L_{j}$ its mappable length. Then $R_{j} \\propto n_{j} L_{j}$. For autosomes in a diploid individual, $n_{A}=2$. For sex chromosomes: in a female (XX), $n_{X}=2$ and $n_{Y}=0$; in a male (XY), $n_{X}=1$ and $n_{Y}=1$.\n\nTo compare across chromosomes of different lengths, one considers length-normalized coverage. Let $\\tilde{R}_{j}=R_{j}/L_{j}$. Then $\\tilde{R}_{j} \\propto n_{j}$. Therefore:\n- Female expectation: $\\tilde{R}_{X} \\approx \\tilde{R}_{A}$ (both reflect two copies), and $\\tilde{R}_{Y} \\approx 0$ (no Y).\n- Male expectation: $\\tilde{R}_{X} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{R}_{A}$ (one copy on X), and $\\tilde{R}_{Y} > 0$ (one copy on Y, with uniquely mapping reads above background noise).\n\nThe observations are:\n1. Reads mapping to the X chromosome are comparable to an autosome of similar size, i.e., $\\tilde{R}_{X} \\approx \\tilde{R}_{A}$, consistent with $n_{X}=2$.\n2. Uniquely mapping Y reads are at background noise levels, i.e., $\\tilde{R}_{Y} \\approx 0$, consistent with $n_{Y}=0$.\n\nThese two features together are diagnostic of a female (XX) and inconsistent with a male (XY), who would show roughly half the X coverage relative to autosomes and a detectable set of uniquely mapping Y reads. Option C is incorrect because, despite the smaller size of the Y chromosome, an XY individual yields a non-negligible number of uniquely mapping Y reads; length normalization and unique mapping regions allow detection above noise. Option D is not supported by the stated evidence: the pattern matches endogenous female coverage ratios rather than an artifact solely explained by contamination, and the question asks for the conclusion based on the genomic evidence provided.\n\nTherefore, the most likely conclusion is that the individual is female.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1908405"}, {"introduction": "Paleogenomics can illuminate not just individuals, but also the social structures they were part of, such as family groups.

To investigate their potential family ties, they have sequenced degraded DNA from bone samples and are comparing their genomes at a large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) sites.\n\nA preliminary computational analysis, which does not account for DNA damage, yields a raw kinship coefficient of $\\phi_{raw} = 0.221$ between S1 and S2. The kinship coefficient, $\\phi$, quantifies the probability that two alleles randomly drawn from the same genetic locus in two individuals are identical by descent.\n\nHowever, experts recognize that ancient DNA (aDNA) is prone to post-mortem chemical degradation. A prevalent form of this damage is cytosine deamination, which results in a cytosine (C) base being misread as a thymine (T) base during sequencing. This process introduces artificial differences between the individuals' genomes, causing a systematic underestimation of their true relatedness.\n\nA biophysicist on the team proposes a linear correction model to account for this effect.
