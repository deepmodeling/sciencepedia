This exercise simulates a common scenario in biogeography, using a pre-established molecular clock rate to date a vicariance event that separated two species.

One species is found exclusively on the island of Maui, and the other is found only on the neighboring island of Moloka'i. The biologist hypothesizes that these two species arose from a common ancestral population that was split when the islands separated, an event known as vicariance.\n\nTo estimate the age of this vicariance event, a 500 base pair segment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene was sequenced from individuals of both species. A comparison of these sequences reveals a total of 8 base pair substitutions between the two species. Previous studies on a wide range of arthropods have an established molecular clock for this specific gene segment, indicating a consistent rate of sequence divergence of 2.0% per million years between separating lineages.\n\nAssuming the observed genetic difference is solely due to mutations accumulated after the vicariance event, calculate the estimated time since the two species diverged. Express your answer in millions of years, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks us to calculate the time of divergence between two species using molecular data. We are given the number of substitutions, the length of the gene sequence, and the calibrated rate of divergence.\n\nFirst, we calculate the observed sequence divergence ($D$) between the two beetle species. The divergence is the number of substitutions divided by the total length of the sequence analyzed.\nLet $N_{\\text{sub}}$ be the number of base pair substitutions and $L$ be the length of the gene segment in base pairs.\nGiven values are $N_{\\text{sub}} = 8$ and $L = 500$ bp.\n\nThe proportional divergence $D$ is calculated as:\n$$D = \\frac{N_{\\text{sub}}}{L} = \\frac{8}{500} = 0.016$$\nThis means the sequences of the two species differ by 1.6%.\n\nNext, we use the molecular clock hypothesis, which states that the genetic divergence between two species is proportional to the time since they last shared a common ancestor. The relationship is given by the formula:\n$$D = R \\times T$$\nwhere $D$ is the sequence divergence, $R$ is the rate of divergence, and $T$ is the time since divergence.\n\nThe problem states that the rate of sequence divergence, $R$, is 2.0% per million years. To use this in our calculation, we must convert the percentage to a decimal form:\n$$R = 2.0\\% \\text{ per million years} = 0.020 \\text{ per million years}$$\nIt is important to note that this is the rate of divergence *between* the two lineages, which is exactly what our calculated divergence $D$ represents.\n\nNow we can solve for the time $T$ by rearranging the formula:\n$$T = \\frac{D}{R}$$\n\nSubstituting the values we have for $D$ and $R$:\n$$T = \\frac{0.016}{0.020}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$T = \\frac{16}{20} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$\nThe unit for time $T$ is millions of years, as the rate $R$ was given in units of per million years. So, the estimated time of divergence is 0.8 million years.\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value of 0.8 has one significant figure. To express it with two significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$T = 0.80 \\text{ million years}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.80}$$", "id": "1757774"}, {"introduction": "Often, a reliable clock rate for a specific gene isn't known beforehand and must be determined.
