This often happens because species rely on different environmental cues; for example, one may respond to temperature while another responds to day length. This practice [@problem_id:1736619] provides a foundational exercise in quantifying this desynchronization, calculating how a steady change in a temperature-dependent event (pond thaw) creates a growing timing gap with a photoperiod-dependent event (prey availability) over several decades.", "problem": "In a particular temperate ecosystem, the breeding phenology of the wood frog (*Rana sylvatica*) is critically dependent on the timing of pond thawing in the spring. Ecologists have been studying the interaction between these frogs and their primary food source during the tadpole stage, which consists of aquatic invertebrates.\n\nIn a reference year, designated as Year 0, the following baseline observations were made:\n- The pond ice melts completely (ice-off) on April 15th, which is the 105th day of the year.\n- The frogs begin their breeding rituals exactly 5 days after ice-off.\n- The frog eggs hatch into tadpoles, which require immediate food, 10 days after breeding begins.\n- In Year 0, the peak abundance of the aquatic invertebrate prey is perfectly synchronized with the hatching of the tadpoles. This invertebrate peak is primarily cued by photoperiod and thus occurs on the same calendar day each year.\n\nDue to regional climate warming, the date of ice-off has been advancing (occurring earlier) at a steady rate of 0.45 days per year.\n\nAssuming this rate of advance remains constant, calculate the phenological mismatch after 40 years of warming. The phenological mismatch is defined as the absolute difference in days between the date of tadpole hatching and the date of the invertebrate peak.\n\nExpress your final answer in days, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "In Year 0, ice-off is on day 105, breeding begins 5 days later on day 110, and tadpoles hatch 10 days after breeding begins, on day 120. The invertebrate peak is photoperiod-cued and fixed on day 120 each year.\n\nLet $t$ be the number of years after Year 0. The ice-off date advances earlier at a constant rate of $0.45$ days per year, so the ice-off day is\n$$105 - 0.45 t.$$\nBreeding begins 5 days after ice-off, on\n$$105 - 0.45 t + 5 = 110 - 0.45 t,$$\nand hatching occurs 10 days after breeding begins, on\n$$110 - 0.45 t + 10 = 120 - 0.45 t.$$\nThe invertebrate peak remains fixed at day 120. Therefore, the phenological mismatch $M(t)$, defined as the absolute difference in days between hatching and the invertebrate peak, is\n$$M(t) = |(120 - 0.45 t) - 120| = 0.45 t.$$\nAfter $t = 40$ years,\n$$M(40) = 0.45 \\times 40 = 18.$$\nRounded to two significant figures, the mismatch is $18$ days.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18}$$", "id": "1736619"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply measuring a phenological mismatch in days, it is crucial to understand its quantitative impact on ecosystem functions like energy transfer. We can model the seasonal abundance of interacting species as population curves, where the overlap between them represents the total interaction strength.

The biomass of a key species of ice algae, denoted by $A(t)$, and the grazing activity of a key zooplankton species, $Z(t)$, can both be described as Gaussian functions of time, $t$, where $t$ is measured in days from the start of the year. The total energy transferred from the algae to the zooplankton, which is a measure of the ecosystem's health, is proportional to the integrated product of their populations, $\\int A(t)Z(t) dt$, over the entire season.\n\nUnder historical climatic conditions, the algae bloom reaches its peak at day $t_{A,hist} = 150.0$, and the zooplankton grazing activity peaks at day $t_{Z} = 165.0$. The characteristic durations of these events are given by the standard deviations of their respective Gaussian curves: $\\sigma_A = 12.0$ days for the algae and $\\sigma_Z = 16.0$ days for the zooplankton.\n\nDue to projected climate change, it is anticipated that the annual sea ice will break up earlier. This environmental shift causes the algae bloom to peak $\\Delta t_{adv} = 21.0$ days earlier than its historical average.

This exercise [@problem_id:1736583] models this evolutionary challenge by asking you to determine the optimal way for a plant to weigh conflicting temperature ($t_{T}$) and photoperiod ($t_{L}$) cues to maximize its reproductive fitness in a new environment, providing insight into the mechanisms of rapid adaptation.", "problem": "A species of perennial plant, *Silene borealis*, is expanding its range poleward in response to a warming climate. Its reproductive success is critically dependent on the timing of its flowering, known as phenology. In its new, higher-latitude expansion range, the plant faces a novel combination of temperature and day-length cues.\n\nThe flowering time, $t_{\\text{flower}}$, measured in days after the vernal equinox, is determined by a genetically controlled mechanism that integrates information from two independent pathways: a thermal pathway and a photoperiodic pathway. The relative influence of these two pathways is governed by a single, continuously variable trait, the weighting parameter $\\alpha$, where $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$. The resulting flowering time is a linear combination:\n$$t_{\\text{flower}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\cdot t_{T} + (1-\\alpha) \\cdot t_{L}$$\nHere, $t_T$ is the flowering time that would be induced by the thermal pathway alone, and $t_L$ is the flowering time that would be induced by the photoperiodic pathway alone.\n\nField observations and controlled-environment studies for the population in the new expansion range have established the following parameters:\n- The thermal cue, based on accumulated warmth, would trigger flowering at $t_{T} = 35$ days.\n- The photoperiodic cue, based on critical day-length, would trigger flowering at $t_{L} = 65$ days.\n\nEcological analysis has shown that the reproductive fitness, $W$, of an individual plant is maximized at an optimal flowering time, $t_{\\text{opt}}$.
