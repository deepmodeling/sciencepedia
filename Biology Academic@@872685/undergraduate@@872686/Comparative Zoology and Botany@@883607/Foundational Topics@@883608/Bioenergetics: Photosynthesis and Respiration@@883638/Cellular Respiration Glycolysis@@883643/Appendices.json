A single molecule of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is introduced into this system. The pathway is allowed to proceed to completion, resulting in the full conversion of the initial substrate into pyruvate.\n\nCalculate the gross number of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules generated through substrate-level phosphorylation during this specific process, starting from one molecule of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and ending with pyruvate.", "solution": "We consider glycolysis beginning with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The aldolase reaction splits one molecule of FBP into two triose phosphates: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). Triose phosphate isomerase rapidly interconverts DHAP and GAP, so the carbon flux proceeds as two molecules of GAP.\n\nEach GAP proceeds through the following sequence:\n1) GAP is converted to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, using inorganic phosphate and reducing NAD^{+} to NADH. This step does not involve ATP formation or consumption.\n2) 1,3-BPG donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP via phosphoglycerate kinase:\n$$\\text{1,3-BPG} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{3-phosphoglycerate} + \\text{ATP}.$$\nThis yields one ATP per GAP.\n3) Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), formed downstream from 3-phosphoglycerate via phosphoglycerate mutase and enolase, donates its phosphate to ADP via pyruvate kinase:\n$$\\text{PEP} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{pyruvate} + \\text{ATP}.$$\nThis yields one additional ATP per GAP.\n\nTherefore, per molecule of GAP, substrate-level phosphorylation generates\n$$1\\ \\text{ATP (phosphoglycerate kinase)} + 1\\ \\text{ATP (pyruvate kinase)} = 2\\ \\text{ATP}.$$\nSince one molecule of FBP yields two molecules of GAP, the gross ATP produced is\n$$2 \\times 2 = 4.$$\n\nBecause the problem starts at FBP, there is no ATP investment to subtract from earlier steps (hexokinase and phosphofructokinase), and the requested quantity is explicitly the gross ATP generated via substrate-level phosphorylation.

Arsenate serves as a classic example of a metabolic poison that mimics a natural substrate, leading to a \"short-circuit\" in energy production. In this problem, [@problem_id:1735485], you will explore how arsenate uncouples substrate-level phosphorylation, which in turn reveals the critical role of the high-energy intermediate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in generating ATP.", "problem": "A toxicologist is investigating the metabolic impact of arsenate ($AsO_4^{3-}$) on mammalian cells. It is known that arsenate is a chemical analogue of inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) and can interfere with glycolysis. Specifically, during the payoff phase of glycolysis, the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) normally catalyzes the oxidation and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In the presence of arsenate, the enzyme mistakenly uses arsenate instead of phosphate, producing 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate. This arsenate-containing product is highly unstable in the aqueous environment of the cytosol and immediately and spontaneously hydrolyzes to 3-phosphoglycerate and free arsenate, without the action of any enzyme.\n\nConsider a single molecule of glucose being metabolized by a cell under conditions where arsenate is present in sufficient concentration to fully substitute for inorganic phosphate in the GAPDH-catalyzed reaction. Assuming the rest of the glycolytic pathway proceeds without inhibition, calculate the net yield of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules generated from this single glucose molecule through glycolysis.", "solution": "Glycolysis of one glucose involves an investment phase and a payoff phase. In the investment phase, two ATP are consumed: one at hexokinase converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and one at phosphofructokinase-1 converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Thus the ATP cost is $2$.\n\nIn the normal payoff phase (without arsenate), two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate are converted to two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using inorganic phosphate, and then phosphoglycerate kinase generates ATP from each 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, yielding $2$ ATP total at this step per glucose. Subsequently, pyruvate kinase generates one ATP per phosphoenolpyruvate, giving $2$ more ATP per glucose. Hence, normally $4$ ATP are produced and the net is $2$.\n\nWith arsenate present at sufficient concentration to fully substitute for inorganic phosphate at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step, the enzyme forms 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This arsenate ester spontaneously hydrolyzes to 3-phosphoglycerate and free arsenate without passing through the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction, so the substrate-level phosphorylation that would generate ATP at phosphoglycerate kinase does not occur. Carbon flux continues from 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase still generates $2$ ATP per glucose (one per triose).\n\nTherefore, in the arsenate condition:\n- ATP produced in the payoff phase comes only from pyruvate kinase: $2$.\n- ATP consumed in the investment phase remains $2$.\n\nThe net ATP yield is\n$$\n\\text{ATP}_{\\text{net}}=2-2=0.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1735485"}, {"introduction": "While glycolysis is a highly conserved pathway, the entry points can be remarkably diverse, reflecting the varied diets of different organisms.

These monomers are absorbed by the gut epithelial cells to be funneled into glycolysis.\n\nUnlike the canonical glycolytic pathway which starts with α-D-glucose, these cells must first process the β-D-glucose anomer. Assume the cellular machinery includes orthologs of standard glycolytic enzymes, such as Phosphoglucose Isomerase (which converts α-D-glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) and Phosphofructokinase-1 (which phosphorylates fructose-6-phosphate). The cell also possesses two specialized enzymes:\n1.  **β-Glucokinase**: A kinase that specifically phosphorylates β-D-glucose at the C6 position, using one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n2.  **Phosphoglucose Mutarotase**: An enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion between β-D-glucose-6-phosphate and α-D-glucose-6-phosphate.\n\nGiven this enzymatic toolkit, determine the correct sequence of enzymes required to convert one molecule of β-D-glucose into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, preparing it for the cleavage stage of glycolysis.\n\nA. β-Glucokinase → Phosphofructokinase-1 → Phosphoglucose Mutarotase → Phosphoglucose Isomerase\n\nB.
