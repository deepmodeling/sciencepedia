{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly understand the cell cycle, it is crucial to precisely track the state of the genetic material. This exercise challenges you to distinguish between chromosome number, which is determined by counting centromeres, and the total amount of DNA. By applying the standard $n$ and $C$ notation to a haploid moss cell, you can focus on the fundamental changes during DNA replication and sister chromatid separation without the added complexity of homologous pairs, thereby solidifying your grasp of these core concepts [@problem_id:1778993].", "problem": "In the life cycle of a typical moss (Phylum Bryophyta), the dominant generation is the haploid gametophyte, which develops from a haploid spore. A single haploid moss spore lands on a suitable moist substrate and begins to germinate, eventually forming a filamentous structure called a protonema. Consider a single cell from this developing protonema as it undergoes its first mitotic cell cycle.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, let $n$ represent the haploid number of chromosomes (the number of chromosomes in one complete, unreplicated set) and let $C$ represent the amount of DNA, by mass, in that same unreplicated haploid set.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly describes the state of the cell, represented as an ordered pair (Chromosome Number, DNA Content), at four distinct stages: 1) the initial spore before germination, 2) the cell in the G2 phase of interphase, 3) the cell during the anaphase stage of mitosis, and 4) one of the two identical daughter cells immediately after cytokinesis is complete?\n\nA. Stage 1: $(n, C)$; Stage 2: $(n, 2C)$; Stage 3: $(2n, 2C)$; Stage 4: $(n, C)$\n\nB. Stage 1: $(n, C)$; Stage 2: $(n, 2C)$; Stage 3: $(n, 2C)$; Stage 4: $(n, C)$\n\nC.

Stage 1: $(n, C)$; Stage 2: $(n, 2C)$; Stage 3: $(2n, 4C)$; Stage 4: $(n, 2C)$", "solution": "We are tracking two quantities through the first mitotic cycle of a haploid moss gametophyte cell: chromosome number, defined operationally by the number of centromeres present in the cell, and DNA content by mass relative to one unreplicated haploid set. By definition, the haploid number is $n$ and the DNA content of one unreplicated haploid set is $C$.\n\nStage 1 (initial spore before germination): The spore is haploid and its chromosomes are unreplicated prior to entering S phase. Therefore its chromosome number is $n$ and its DNA content is $C$. Hence Stage 1 is $(n, C)$.\n\nStage 2 (G2 phase of interphase): After S phase but before mitosis, the cell remains haploid with respect to homolog number, so the chromosome number, counted by centromeres, remains $n$. However, each chromosome has been replicated to form two sister chromatids, doubling the DNA mass. Therefore DNA content is $2C$. Hence Stage 2 is $(n, 2C)$.\n\nStage 3 (anaphase of mitosis): During anaphase, sister chromatids separate and each chromatid becomes an independent chromosome by centromere count. Thus the chromosome number doubles to $2n$. No DNA synthesis occurs during mitosis, and the total DNA in the single cell remains that present in G2 until cytokinesis partitions it; therefore the DNA content at this instant is $2C$. Hence Stage 3 is $(2n, 2C)$.\n\nStage 4 (one daughter cell immediately after cytokinesis): Cytokinesis partitions the chromatids equally into two daughter cells. Each daughter cell receives $n$ chromosomes (one chromatid per original chromosome) and the corresponding DNA content per daughter is $C$. Hence Stage 4 is $(n, C)$.\n\nThe only option matching $(n, C)$; $(n, 2C)$; $(2n, 2C)$; $(n, C)$ is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1778993"}, {"introduction": "A microscopic view of a tissue like a plant root tip provides a static snapshot of many cells at different points in a dynamic process. A key principle in cell biology is that for an asynchronous population of cells, the proportion of cells in any given phase reflects the relative duration of that phase. This practice problem provides a classic example of how to apply this principle, translating observational cell count data into a quantitative estimate of how long specific stages of the cell cycle, such as anaphase, actually last [@problem_id:1778982].", "problem": "A botany student is investigating the cell cycle in the apical meristem of a broad bean (*Vicia faba*) root tip. It is known from previous studies that the complete cell cycle for these meristematic cells takes 22.0 hours. The student prepares a microscope slide of a longitudinal section of the root tip, stains it to visualize the chromosomes, and observes a total of 1250 cells in the field of view. The student's counts for each phase of the cell cycle are as follows: 1045 cells in interphase, 110 cells in prophase, 42 cells in metaphase, 18 cells in anaphase, and 35 cells in telophase. Assuming the population of cells is asynchronous and uniformly distributed throughout the cycle, calculate the approximate duration of anaphase. Express your answer in minutes, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "For an asynchronous, uniformly cycling population, the fraction of cells observed in a given phase equals the fraction of the total cycle time spent in that phase.

This exercise presents a comparative thought experiment, contrasting a wall-less amoeba with a walled algal cell to highlight their different cytokinetic mechanisms. By exploring the effect of a specific drug that inhibits the contractile ring, you will deduce why one cell fails to divide while the other succeeds, revealing the critical difference between a cleavage furrow and a cell plate [@problem_id:1778983].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanisms of cell division in two distinct eukaryotic microorganisms: a species of amoeba, which is a protozoan lacking a cell wall, and a species of unicellular green alga, which possesses a rigid cellulose cell wall. Both organisms are cultured in separate, ideal environments. At the G2/M transition, a potent drug is introduced into both cultures. This drug specifically acts as an inhibitor, preventing the assembly and function of the actin-myosin contractile ring, but it has no effect on microtubule dynamics or the process of nuclear division (mitosis).\n\nAssuming both the amoeba and the algal cell successfully complete mitosis, what will be the most likely observable state of each cell type after a time period that would normally suffice for the completion of one entire cell cycle?\n\nA. The amoeba will form a single, large, binucleated cell, while the algal cell will divide normally into two distinct daughter cells.\n\nB.

Both the amoeba and the algal cell will divide normally into two distinct daughter cells.\n\nE. Both the amoeba and the algal cell will be arrested in metaphase and will not complete division.", "solution": "The key distinction is between karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis, and the mechanisms of cytokinesis in wall-less versus walled eukaryotic cells. The drug specifically inhibits assembly and function of the actin-myosin contractile ring but leaves microtubule dynamics and mitosis intact. Therefore, nuclei will divide normally in both organisms, but the outcome of cytokinesis depends on the machinery each cell type uses.\n\nIn the amoeba, which lacks a cell wall, cytokinesis occurs by cleavage furrow formation driven by an actin-myosin contractile ring. Inhibition of this ring prevents furrow ingression and therefore blocks cytokinesis. Because mitosis proceeds normally and the plasma membrane cannot complete the division without the contractile ring, the most likely result after one normal cell cycle duration is a single cell that contains two nuclei, that is, a binucleated cell.\n\nIn the unicellular green alga with a rigid cellulose cell wall, cytokinesis typically occurs by formation of a cell plate mediated by the phragmoplast, a microtubule- and vesicle-dependent apparatus. This process does not rely on an actin-myosin contractile ring to constrict the membrane; instead, microtubules guide vesicles that coalesce to form a new cell wall between daughter nuclei. Because the drug does not affect microtubules or mitosis, the algal cell should complete cytokinesis and divide normally into two daughter cells.\n\nEvaluating the options: A matches these outcomes. B is incorrect because the algal cell should divide. C is incorrect because it reverses the expected outcomes. D is incorrect because the amoeba should fail cytokinesis. E is incorrect because the cells are not arrested in metaphase; mitosis is unaffected and completes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1778983"}]}
