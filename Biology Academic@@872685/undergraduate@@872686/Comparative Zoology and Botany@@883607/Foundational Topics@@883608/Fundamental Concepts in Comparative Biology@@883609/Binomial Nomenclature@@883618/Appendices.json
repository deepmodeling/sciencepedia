{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Correctly formatting a scientific name is the foundational skill of binomial nomenclature. These rules for capitalization and italicization are not merely stylistic; they are a universal code that prevents ambiguity and ensures every scientist, anywhere in the world, recognizes a formal taxonomic name. This first exercise [@problem_id:1733302] challenges you to act as a proofreader, identifying common formatting errors to reinforce these essential conventions.", "problem": "In a biology lab report, a student is tasked with discussing the experimental results involving the fruit fly, maize (corn), and a common bacterium. The student lists the organisms in the materials section as follows:\n- `drosophila melanogaster`\n- `Zea Mays`\n- `e. coli`\n\nAccording to the rules of binomial nomenclature and standard scientific writing conventions, several formatting errors are present in this list. Below is a list of potential formatting rules. Your task is to identify which of these rules were violated in the student's list. Select all options that correspond to a violated rule.\n\nA. The genus name, or its abbreviation, must always be capitalized.\n\nB. The specific epithet must always be in lowercase.\n\nC. The genus name is always written out in full and never abbreviated.\n\nD. The entire scientific name (both genus and specific epithet, or genus abbreviation and specific epithet) must be italicized or underlined.\n\nE. Both the genus and specific epithet must begin with a capital letter.\n\nF. The specific epithet can be abbreviated to a single letter after its first use.", "solution": "We analyze each listed organism against standard binomial nomenclature and scientific formatting conventions:\n- Correct conventions: The genus name must be capitalized; the specific epithet must be lowercase; the full binomial (genus plus specific epithet, or genus abbreviation plus specific epithet) must be italicized (or underlined when italics are unavailable); the genus name may be abbreviated to its initial followed by a period after first mention, but when abbreviated it remains capitalized; the specific epithet is never abbreviated.\n\nEvaluate each student entry:\n1) drosophila melanogaster\n- Genus not capitalized: violates the rule that the genus name must be capitalized (A).\n- Not italicized: violates the rule that the entire scientific name must be italicized (D).\n- Specific epithet is lowercase: this follows the rule in (B), so no violation of (B) here.\n\n2) Zea Mays\n- Specific epithet capitalized: violates the rule that the specific epithet must be lowercase (B).\n- Not italicized: violates (D).\n- Genus capitalized correctly, so no violation of (A) here.\n\n3) e. coli\n- Genus abbreviation in lowercase: violates the rule that the genus name, or its abbreviation, must be capitalized (A).\n- Not italicized: violates (D).\n- Specific epithet lowercase, so (B) is followed here.\n\nConsider the remaining options:\n- C is not a correct rule because genus names may be abbreviated; therefore, it is not a rule that can be “violated.”\n- E is incorrect because only the genus, not the specific epithet, is capitalized.\n- F is incorrect because the specific epithet is never abbreviated.\n\nTherefore, the violated rules in the student’s list are A, B, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "1733302"}, {"introduction": "Beyond proper formatting, a scientific name must be validly published to have any official standing in science. A name that is mentioned informally, such as in a blog post or news article, without a formal scientific description and type specimen, is considered a *nomen nudum* or 'naked name.' This practice [@problem_id:1733315] uses a real-world example to explore the critical requirements that give a new name its legitimacy and prevent nomenclatural chaos.", "problem": "In 2006, a fascinating new dinosaur skull was displayed at a children's museum. A popular science blog, enthusiastic about the discovery, published an article referring to the fossil by the name *\"Dracorex hogwartsia\"*. This blog post included photographs of the skull but did not contain a detailed anatomical description, diagnosis, or differential diagnosis that would formally distinguish it from other related species. Several months later, a formal scientific paper was published in a peer-reviewed journal by paleontologists Robert T. Bakker et al. This paper provided a complete description, designated a holotype specimen, and officially proposed the name *Dracorex hogwartsia* for the new genus and species.\n\nAccording to the rules of nomenclature governed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), what was the status of the name *\"Dracorex hogwartsia\"* as it appeared in the science blog, prior to the formal publication of the scientific paper?\n\nA. A valid scientific name\n\nB. A *nomen nudum* (naked name)\n\nC. A junior synonym\n\nD. A *nomen oblitum* (forgotten name)\n\nE. A *nomen dubium* (doubtful name)", "solution": "We determine the availability status of the blog usage of the name under the ICZN by checking the necessary criteria for an available species-group name and whether the blog meets them.\n\nFirst, for a name to be available, it must be published in a “published work” sensu ICZN Article 8. In 2006, online-only blog posts did not qualify as published works under Article 8 (pre-amendment), and web pages were excluded as “published works” under Article 9. Therefore, any name appearing only in a blog at that time would be unavailable.\n\nSecond, even setting aside the publication medium, ICZN Article 13.1.1 requires that, for names published after 1930, a new species-group name must be accompanied by a description or definition that states in words the characters that differentiate the taxon, or a bibliographic reference to such a statement. The blog post, as stated, provided photographs but no anatomical description, diagnosis, or differential diagnosis, and thus failed Article 13.1.1. Additionally, for names proposed after 1999, Article 16.4 requires explicit fixation of a name-bearing type (e.g., designation of a holotype); the blog did not designate a holotype. Hence, even if the medium were acceptable, the absence of a differentiating description and type fixation renders the name unavailable.\n\nA name that is published without meeting these descriptive and typification requirements is a nomen nudum (“naked name”): it is not an available name and has no standing in zoological nomenclature until validly published with the required elements. The later peer-reviewed paper by Bakker et al. provided a full description and holotype designation, thereby making the name available from that paper, not from the blog.\n\nIt is not a junior synonym (no competing senior name for the same taxon exists in this context), not a nomen oblitum (which concerns long-neglected senior synonyms under specific conditions), and not a nomen dubium (which concerns taxonomic uncertainty due to inadequate type material, not failure of publication or description).\n\nTherefore, under the ICZN, the blog usage of the name had the status of a nomen nudum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733315"}, {"introduction": "Once a name is correctly formatted and validly published, its status is governed by the Principle of Priority, the ultimate rule for resolving conflicts.

This exercise [@problem_id:1733296] presents a modern scenario involving both digital and print publications, forcing you to apply the strict rules of the ICZN to determine which name is the senior synonym and therefore the correct one to use.", "problem": "Two independent teams of entomologists discover and describe what is later determined to be the same new species of ground beetle. The \"digital team\" and the \"print team\" publish their findings unaware of each other's work.\n\nThe digital team publishes their description of the species, which they name *Aptus digitalis*, in an online-only, peer-reviewed, open-access journal. The article is posted online and becomes publicly accessible on October 1, 2018. However, at the time of this initial online posting, the authors had not yet registered the new name with the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature (ZooBank), and the publication consequently lacked a ZooBank registration identifier. The authors complete the ZooBank registration for the name *Aptus digitalis* on November 15, 2018.\n\nThe print team publishes their description of the species, naming it *Aptus impressus*, in a long-established, peer-reviewed print journal. According to the journal's colophon and distribution records, the printed volume containing the description was mailed to subscribers and made available for purchase on October 20, 2018. This publication fully complies with all traditional standards for a valid nomenclatural act.\n\nA subsequent coleopterist, upon reviewing the literature, recognizes that *Aptus digitalis* and *Aptus impressus* refer to the same biological species. According to the Principle of Priority as governed by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), which of the following statements correctly identifies the valid name for this species?\n\nA. *Aptus digitalis*, because its online publication date of October 1, 2018, predates the publication of *Aptus impressus*.\n\nB. *Aptus impressus*, because the electronic publication of *Aptus digitalis* only became nomenclaturally available on November 15, 2018, after its ZooBank registration.\n\nC. *Aptus digitalis*, because electronic publication is officially preferred and always has priority over print publication in cases of dispute, as per a 2012 ICZN amendment.\n\nD. Neither name has priority. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature must issue a ruling to resolve the conflict since the publications are from different media.\n\nE. The \"Principle of the First Reviser\" applies, allowing the next author who addresses the synonymy to choose which name has precedence based on its appropriateness.", "solution": "By the ICZN Principle of Priority (Article 23), the valid name for a species is the oldest available name. Therefore, we must determine the dates on which each name became available under the Code.\n\nFor the print publication, availability follows the traditional standard: a printed work is published when it is issued and distributed (Articles 8.1 and 21.2). The print team’s work was mailed and made available on October 20, 2018, and it fully complies with the Code; therefore, the name Aptus impressus became available on October 20, 2018.\n\nFor the electronic-only publication, the 2012 ICZN Amendment (Article 8.5) specifies that a work issued electronically is only considered published (and its names available) if, among other requirements, it is registered in ZooBank and the work itself contains evidence of that registration (Article 8.5.3). Because the digital team’s article posted on October 1, 2018 lacked ZooBank registration at that time, it did not make the name Aptus digitalis available on October 1. The authors completed the ZooBank registration on November 15, 2018; only from the date when the electronic publication met the registration requirements could the name be considered available. Thus, Aptus digitalis became available on November 15, 2018.\n\nComparing the availability dates, Aptus impressus (October 20, 2018) predates Aptus digitalis (November 15, 2018). By Article 23, Aptus impressus has priority.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because the October 1 electronic posting did not meet Article 8.5 requirements and did not establish availability on that date.\n- Option B is correct: the electronic name only became available on November 15, 2018, which postdates the print name’s availability on October 20, 2018.\n- Option C is incorrect; the 2012 amendment does not prefer electronic over print publication; it only permits electronic publication under specified conditions.\n- Option D is incorrect; no Commission ruling is needed because the dates are not simultaneous and the Code resolves the case by priority.\n- Option E is incorrect; the First Reviser applies only to simultaneously published names, which is not the case here.\n\nHence, the valid name is Aptus impressus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733296"}]}
