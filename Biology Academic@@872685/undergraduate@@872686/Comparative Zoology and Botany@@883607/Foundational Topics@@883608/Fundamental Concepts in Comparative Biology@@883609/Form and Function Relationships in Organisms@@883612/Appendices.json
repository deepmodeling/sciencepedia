Dynamic effects from running and jumping amplify this force. The paleontologists' model proposes that this peak force is given by $F_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1}{4} M g \\cdot f(M)$, where $M$ is the total body mass of the animal, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $f(M)$ is a dimensionless dynamic load factor that depends on the animal's mass.\n\nFurther analysis suggests that larger animals in this lineage evolved to move more cautiously to mitigate the risk of bone fracture from high-impact forces. This behavioral and physiological adaptation is captured by a dynamic load factor that scales with mass according to the relation $f(M) = \\beta M^{-1/6}$, where $\\beta$ is a dimensionless proportionality constant.\n\nAssuming this model is correct and that the peak stress $\\sigma$ is constant across all species of varying mass within this lineage, determine the value of the scaling exponent $k$ in the allometric equation $A = cM^k$, which relates the femur's cross-sectional area, $A$, to the animal's body mass, $M$.
