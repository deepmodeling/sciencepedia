By considering a defect that affects one but not the other, you are challenged to predict the functional consequences, sharpening your ability to link cellular structure directly to tissue-level physiology.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying a rare hypothetical genetic condition that selectively prevents the formation of motile cilia, while leaving non-motile structures like microvilli completely unaffected. The study aims to understand the functional consequences on different tissues. Consider two specific tissues: the simple columnar epithelium lining the small intestine, whose primary role is nutrient absorption, and the pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium lining the oviduct (fallopian tube), which is responsible for transporting the oocyte toward the uterus.\n\nGiven this specific genetic defect, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the functional impairment?\n\nA. The simple columnar epithelium of the small intestine would be more severely impaired because the lack of cilia would halt the movement of digested food along the intestinal tract.\n\nB. The pseudostratified columnar epithelium of the oviduct would be more severely impaired because the transport of the non-motile oocyte is critically dependent on ciliary action.\n\nC. Both tissues would be equally and severely impaired, as cilia and microvilli are functionally interchangeable for both absorption and transport.\n\nD. The simple columnar epithelium of the small intestine would be more severely impaired because its absorptive capacity is directly dependent on ciliary beating.\n\nE. Neither tissue's primary function would be critically impaired, as peristaltic muscular contractions can fully compensate for the loss of cilia in both organs.", "solution": "We are told a genetic defect selectively prevents the formation of motile cilia while leaving non-motile surface specializations such as microvilli intact. We must predict which tissue’s primary function is most impaired under this defect.\n\nStep 1: Identify the cellular structures and their functions.\n- Motile cilia are hair-like projections containing axonemal microtubules and dynein arms; their coordinated beating generates directional fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. They are essential for moving non-motile cells or luminal contents, as in the oviduct and respiratory tract.\n- Microvilli are actin-based, non-motile projections that increase apical surface area to enhance absorptive and digestive capacity; they do not beat and are not involved in transport.\n\nStep 2: Apply to the small intestine’s simple columnar epithelium.\n- Primary function: nutrient absorption.\n- Key structure: microvilli (brush border) to increase surface area for absorption.\n- The absence of motile cilia has no direct effect on absorption because enterocytes rely on microvilli, which are unaffected.\n- Movement of chyme along the intestine is mediated by smooth muscle peristalsis and segmental contractions, not by ciliary action.\n- Therefore, statements asserting severe impairment of intestinal function due to lack of cilia (A and D) are incorrect.\n\nStep 3: Apply to the oviduct’s ciliated epithelium.\n- Primary function: transport of the non-motile oocyte toward the uterus.\n- Key structure: motile cilia on epithelial cells, whose beating creates directional flow necessary for efficient oocyte transport; this works synergistically with tubal muscular contractions.\n- If motile cilia fail to form, the ciliary component of transport is lost. Although peristaltic contractions persist, they do not fully compensate for the absence of ciliary-driven flow; clinically this leads to impaired fertility and increased risk of ectopic implantation.\n- Therefore, the oviduct’s function is critically dependent on ciliary action, and it would be more severely impaired than the small intestine under the specified defect.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n- A: Incorrect. Intestinal transit is by peristalsis, and absorption depends on microvilli, not cilia.\n- B: Correct. Oviduct transport of a non-motile oocyte critically depends on motile cilia.\n- C: Incorrect. Cilia and microvilli are not interchangeable; they have distinct structures and functions.\n- D: Incorrect. Intestinal absorptive capacity depends on microvilli, which are unaffected.\n- E: Incorrect. Peristalsis cannot fully compensate for the loss of ciliary action in the oviduct; a critical impairment remains.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that the oviduct epithelium would be more severely impaired due to loss of motile cilia essential for oocyte transport.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1730238"}, {"introduction": "Epithelial cells are bound together by a variety of intercellular junctions, each with a unique role in maintaining tissue integrity and function. This problem [@problem_id:1730257] focuses on desmosomes, the junctions responsible for providing mechanical strength, particularly in tissues subjected to physical stress like the skin. By exploring a scenario where a specific toxin targets these structures, you can deduce the precise pathological outcome, reinforcing the \"structure-equals-function\" principle at a molecular level.", "problem": "An animal is exposed to a newly discovered aquatic bacterium that produces an exotoxin. Laboratory analysis reveals that this toxin is a highly specific protease that exclusively targets and degrades the cadherin proteins (desmoglein and desmocollin) that constitute the core of desmosomes. This bacterium colonizes the animal's skin, which is a classic example of a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Assuming the toxin diffuses through the outer layers and becomes active throughout the epithelium, which of the following choices describes the most direct and immediate pathological consequence for the affected tissue?\n\nA. The epithelial cells will lose their apical-basal polarity, disrupting the organized layering of the tissue.\n\nB. The selective barrier function of the epithelium will be lost, allowing for uncontrolled leakage of interstitial fluid and solutes between the cells.\n\nC. Communication and metabolic coupling between adjacent epithelial cells via the passage of small ions and signaling molecules will be terminated.\n\nD. The epithelial cells will lose their strong adhesion to one another, leading to the separation of cells and the formation of intraepithelial blisters under mechanical stress.\n\nE. The entire epithelial sheet will detach from the underlying basement membrane, leading to a complete sloughing off of the skin.", "solution": "Identify the molecular target: the toxin is a protease specific for cadherins that form desmosomes in epithelia, namely desmoglein and desmocollin. These are the transmembrane adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell adhesion in desmosomes by homophilic interactions and link to intermediate filaments via plakoglobin and desmoplakin, conferring mechanical strength.\n\nState the physiological role of desmosomes: desmosomes are spot-like intercellular junctions that provide strong mechanical coupling between epithelial cells, especially in stratified squamous epithelia such as skin. They are critical for withstanding shear and tensile forces. Loss of desmosomal function leads to acantholysis (loss of cohesion between keratinocytes) and intraepithelial blister formation.\n\nMap each option to the corresponding junctional complex and consequence:\n- Option A (loss of apical-basal polarity) primarily involves adherens junctions and polarity complexes (e.g., cadherin-catenin complexes at zonula adherens and Par/Crumbs/Scribble complexes), not desmosomes.\n- Option B (loss of selective barrier function with paracellular leakage) is a function of tight junctions (zonula occludens), composed of claudins and occludin, not desmosomes.\n- Option C (loss of intercellular communication via small ions and signaling molecules) is mediated by gap junctions formed by connexins, not desmosomes.\n- Option D (loss of strong adhesion between epithelial cells leading to separation and intraepithelial blisters under mechanical stress) is the direct consequence of desmosome disruption, as seen pathophysiologically in conditions like pemphigus where desmoglein function is impaired.\n- Option E (detachment of the epithelial sheet from the basement membrane) reflects failure of hemidesmosomes and integrin-mediated adhesion to the basal lamina components (e.g., laminin 332), not desmosomes.\n\nConclude the direct and immediate consequence: selective proteolysis of desmoglein and desmocollin abolishes desmosomal adhesion, causing loss of intercellular cohesion in the epithelium and intraepithelial blistering under stress.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1730257"}, {"introduction": "Glandular epithelia are specialized for secretion, but the mechanism of product expulsion can vary significantly.
