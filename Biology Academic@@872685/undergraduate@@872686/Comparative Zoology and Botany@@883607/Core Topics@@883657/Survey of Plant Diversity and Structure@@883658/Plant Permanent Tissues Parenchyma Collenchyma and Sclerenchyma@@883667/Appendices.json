This requires an understanding of plant developmental plasticity, specifically the phenomena of etiolation and thigmomorphogenesis.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the condition and expected phenotype of Seedling A (Etiolation).**\nEtiolation is a developmental strategy employed by plants grown in darkness. The primary objective is to allocate all available resources towards rapid stem elongation to push the apical meristem and cotyledons through the soil or leaf litter into the light. To achieve this, other developmental processes are suppressed. These include:\n-   Chlorophyll synthesis (hence the pale color).\n-   Leaf expansion.\n-   Development of mechanical/supportive tissues.\nTherefore, the stem of Seedling A will be long but structurally very weak. It will consist mainly of an epidermis, a cortex of large, elongated parenchyma cells, a pith of similar parenchyma, and underdeveloped vascular bundles. The development of both collenchyma (flexible support) and sclerenchyma (rigid support) will be heavily suppressed and thus minimal.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the condition and expected phenotype of Seedling B (Thigmomorphogenesis).**\nThigmomorphogenesis is the plant's response to mechanical stimuli like wind or touch. The constant stress signals to the plant that it is in an environment where structural integrity is critical for survival. This triggers a suite of developmental changes opposite to those of etiolation:\n-   Inhibited stem elongation, leading to a shorter, stockier plant.\n-   Increased stem diameter.\n-   Significant investment in the synthesis and differentiation of supportive tissues.\nThe stem of Seedling B must be able to resist the bending and flexing caused by the fan. This is achieved by reinforcing the stem structure.\n-   **Collenchyma:** This living tissue provides flexible support. It has thickened primary walls and is typically found in discrete strands or as a continuous cylinder just beneath the epidermis. In response to mechanical stress, the plant will significantly increase the amount of collenchyma to allow the stem to flex without breaking.\n-   **Sclerenchyma:** This tissue provides rigid, non-flexible support. Its cells have thick, lignified secondary walls and are dead at maturity. The most common type in stems is fibers. They are often associated with vascular bundles, forming \"bundle caps\" that dramatically increase the stem's tensile strength and rigidity. Mechanical stress strongly promotes the differentiation of procambial or parenchymal cells into sclerenchyma fibers.\n\n**Step 3: Compare Seedling A and Seedling B and evaluate the given options.**\n-   **Seedling A:** Minimal collenchyma, minimal sclerenchyma. Stem is weak and mostly composed of parenchyma.\n-   **Seedling B:** Abundant collenchyma (sub-epidermally) and abundant sclerenchyma (associated with vascular bundles). Stem is strong and robust.\n\nNow we evaluate the choices based on this comparison:\n\n-   **A. Seedling B will have a significantly greater amount of sclerenchyma fibers for rigidity, but a reduced amount of collenchyma, as its cells differentiate into the more structurally robust sclerenchyma.** This is incorrect. Mechanical stress induces the formation of *both* collenchyma and sclerenchyma. There is no evidence for a direct trade-off where an increase in one necessitates a decrease in the other; they serve complementary roles (flexible vs. rigid support).\n\n-   **B. Seedling A, due to its greater length and inherent instability, will have developed more extensive sub-epidermal collenchyma strands than Seedling B to prevent buckling.** This is incorrect. The etiolation strategy prioritizes reaching light above all else, and this involves *suppressing* the development of costly supportive tissue. The instability of Seedling A is a direct result of the *lack* of supportive tissue, not a trigger for its formation.\n\n-   **C. Both seedlings will possess roughly equal cross-sectional areas of supportive tissue, but Seedling A will be characterized by collenchyma while Seedling B will be characterized by sclerenchyma, reflecting different support strategies.** This is incorrect. The total amount of supportive tissue will be drastically different, with Seedling B having far more. Seedling A will have minimal amounts of both tissue types.\n\n-   **D. The primary anatomical difference will be the shape of the parenchyma cells, which will be highly elongated in Seedling A, with negligible differences in the scarce supportive tissues in seedlings of this age.** This is partially correct in that parenchyma cell shape will differ, but it is fundamentally wrong in its main assertion. It incorrectly dismisses the changes in supportive tissues, which are in fact the most prominent and functionally significant adaptations to these contrasting conditions. The differences in collenchyma and sclerenchyma will be dramatic, not negligible.\n\n-   **E. Seedling B will show a pronounced increase in the abundance of both sub-epidermal collenchyma and sclerenchyma fibers (particularly as bundle caps), while Seedling A will have minimal development of either tissue.** This statement accurately captures the expected outcomes for both seedlings. It correctly identifies that thigmomorphogenesis in Seedling B leads to a proliferation of both major supportive tissue types in their typical locations, and that etiolation in Seedling A leads to the suppression of their development.
