This first exercise challenges you to apply evolutionary reasoning to a classic comparison: the synchronized mass spawning of corals versus the individual hormonal cycles of mammals. By analyzing the adaptive logic behind these different timing mechanisms, you can grasp the fundamental constraints and advantages of external versus internal fertilization. [@problem_id:1748001]", "problem": "In the study of reproductive biology, the synchronization of gamete release or mating receptivity is critical for success. Consider two distinct strategies:\n\n1.  **Mass-Spawning Corals:** These sessile marine invertebrates practice external fertilization. To maximize the chances of their eggs and sperm meeting in the vast ocean, entire populations synchronize their gamete release. This event is tightly regulated by a predictable, external environmental cue: the lunar cycle.\n\n2.  **Terrestrial Mammals:** These motile animals practice internal fertilization. A female's period of sexual receptivity (estrus) is governed primarily by an internal, physiological mechanism: a cyclical fluctuation of reproductive hormones. While a seasonal breeder's cycle might be influenced by external cues like photoperiod, the precise timing of receptivity within that season is an internal process.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate evolutionary analysis of why these two different synchronization strategies are adaptive for their respective organisms?\n\nA. The lunar cycle is a more energy-efficient cue than hormone production, which is why it is favored by simple organisms like corals, whereas the high metabolic rate of mammals allows them to afford the cost of complex internal hormonal cycles.\n\nB. Internal hormonal cycles allow for mate selection based on individual fitness, a process that is impossible in the random gamete mixing of mass-spawning corals. The primary selective pressure for internal cycles is therefore sexual selection.\n\nC. The coral's reliance on a widespread, predictable external cue is an adaptation to coordinate a dispersed, sessile population for successful external fertilization. Conversely, the mammal's internal cycle allows motile individuals, who can actively find each other, to time reproduction based on individual physiological readiness rather than being constrained to a single, environment-wide event.\n\nD. External cues like the lunar cycle are necessary for marine animals because water dilutes chemical signals (pheromones) too quickly for individual communication, whereas in terrestrial environments, air allows for effective pheromonal signaling, which is what hormonal cycles ultimately regulate.", "solution": "Goal: identify the statement that best explains, using evolutionary reasoning, why corals synchronize reproduction to an external, environment-wide cue while terrestrial mammals synchronize reproductive receptivity via internal hormonal cycles.\n\nPrinciple: Natural selection favors strategies that maximize expected reproductive success $W$, which depends on the probability that gametes or mating opportunities result in fertilization, given ecological and life-history constraints. Let $P_{\\text{fert}}$ denote the probability of successful fertilization.\n\nFor mass-spawning corals:\n- Constraint: individuals are sessile and reproduction is external. Gametes are released into a vast, mixing medium where dilution is high. Let $c(t)$ denote instantaneous gamete concentration and $\\tau$ the temporal overlap of releases among individuals. Then $P_{\\text{fert}}$ is an increasing function of both $c(t)$ and $\\tau$, i.e., $P_{\\text{fert}} = f(c(t),\\tau, M)$ with $f$ increasing in $c$ and $\\tau$, and where $M$ summarizes hydrodynamic mixing and dilution. If $N$ individuals release synchronously, then $c(t)$ scales approximately with $N$ during a narrow window, whereas asynchronous release reduces the effective overlap to an $N_{\\text{overlap}} \\ll N$, lowering $c(t)$ at any given time.\n- Solution: a reliable, predictable, population-wide cue such as the lunar cycle provides a shared temporal reference that maximizes $\\tau$ across a spatially dispersed, sessile population, thereby elevating $c(t)$ at the same time and maximizing $P_{\\text{fert}}$. This aligns with adaptation to external fertilization under strong dilution and the coordination problem.\n\nFor terrestrial mammals:\n- Constraint: reproduction is internal, mating is pairwise, and individuals are motile. The key requirement is aligning mating behavior with ovulation to maximize conception. Let $P_{\\text{concep}}$ denote the probability of conception conditioned on mating and ovulation alignment. A female’s internal cycle ensures ovulation and sexual receptivity are coordinated, such that $P_{\\text{concep}} = g(\\text{ovulation timing}, \\text{receptivity}, \\text{mate encounter})$, with $g$ maximized when internal physiology aligns these factors.\n- Solution: internal hormonal cycles provide precise, individual-level timing of ovulation and receptivity. Motility and social behavior allow individuals to locate mates; thus, population-wide synchronization to a single external cue is unnecessary and potentially maladaptive. External seasonal cues (e.g., photoperiod) can modulate the cycle at a coarse scale (seasonality), but fine-scale timing of receptivity within the season is governed internally.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A: Incorrect. Framing the difference as energy efficiency of lunar cues versus hormones is misleading. Corals also deploy internal physiological and endocrine processes to prepare for spawning; the adaptive value lies in coordination across a dispersed population under external fertilization, not primarily in energy costs.\n- Option B: Incomplete/misleading. Although internal cycles can interact with sexual selection, the primary selective pressure shaping estrous cycling is ensuring ovulation-receptivity alignment to maximize $P_{\\text{concep}}$ under internal fertilization. Moreover, sexual selection is not absent in broadcast spawners (e.g., gamete recognition), but it is not the central reason for internal hormonal cycles.\n- Option D: Incorrect generalization. Chemical signaling in water can be effective over distances; many marine organisms use pheromones. The necessity claim is false and ignores the central constraints: sessility and external fertilization in corals versus motility and internal fertilization in mammals.\n\n- Option C: Correct. It directly identifies the adaptive logic: corals use a widespread, predictable external cue to synchronize a dispersed, sessile population for external fertilization, while mammals use internal hormonal cycles to coordinate individual physiological readiness in motile organisms capable of locating mates, without needing a single environment-wide event.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate evolutionary analysis is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1748001"}, {"introduction": "The choice between fertilization strategies is not arbitrary; it's an economic decision shaped by energetic costs and benefits over evolutionary time.

The energetic cost, $C_{int}$, is the sum of two major components: the cost of mate acquisition (searching, courtship, etc.) and the cost of producing a smaller number of more resource-intensive gametes. These costs are given by the relations:\n    -   Mate Acquisition Cost: $C_{search}(M) = \\beta M$\n    -   Gamete Production Cost: $C_{gam}(M) = \\gamma M^{2/3}$\n    The total cost is thus $C_{int}(M) = C_{search}(M) + C_{gam}(M)$.\n\nHere, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are positive constants with appropriate units that represent the energetic cost coefficients for each process.\n\nAssuming that the evolutionary transition point between strategies occurs when they are equally costly, derive an expression for the threshold body mass, $M_{th}$, at which the energetic cost of internal fertilization is exactly equal to that of external fertilization.

Male gametes (spermatia), which are non-motile, are released into the surrounding water.
