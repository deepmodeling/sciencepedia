This exercise quantifies the risk of inbreeding depression, which is the reduced fitness in a given population as a result of breeding of related individuals. By comparing the probability of expressing a harmful recessive allele under selfing versus outcrossing, you can directly model one of the major selective pressures that favors evolving mechanisms to avoid inbreeding [@problem_id:1773903].", "problem": "Consider a large population of a hermaphroditic plant species that is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A single gene with two alleles, a dominant allele `A` and a recessive allele `a`, controls a specific physiological trait. The presence of the homozygous recessive genotype (`aa`) leads to a deleterious, though non-lethal, condition. The frequency of the recessive allele `a` in the population's gene pool is denoted by $q$, where $0 < q < 1$.\n\nAn individual plant from this population can reproduce in two ways: by self-fertilization or by outcrossing with a randomly selected plant from the same population.\n\nWe are interested in comparing the likelihood of producing an offspring with the deleterious condition under these two reproductive strategies. Let $P_{self}$ be the average probability that an offspring produced by self-fertilization will have the `aa` genotype, where the average is taken over all possible parental genotypes in the population according to their frequencies. Let $P_{out}$ be the probability that an offspring produced by random outcrossing will have the `aa` genotype.\n\nCalculate the ratio $R = \\frac{P_{self}}{P_{out}}$.
