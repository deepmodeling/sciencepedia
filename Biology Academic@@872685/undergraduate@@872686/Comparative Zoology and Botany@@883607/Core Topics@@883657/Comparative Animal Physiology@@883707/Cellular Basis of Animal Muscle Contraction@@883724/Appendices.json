{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Muscle contraction is a finely tuned process, where activation is just as important as deactivation. While the influx of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) acts as the \"on\" switch for contraction, the rapid removal of these ions is the critical \"off\" switch that allows muscles to relax. This exercise [@problem_id:1735185] presents a hypothetical scenario to explore the consequences of disabling this crucial relaxation mechanism, forcing us to consider the indispensable role of active calcium transport in completing the contraction-relaxation cycle.", "problem": "Imagine a vertebrate skeletal muscle fiber where a specific pharmacological agent has been introduced that selectively and completely inhibits the Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA) pumps. These pumps are normally responsible for the active transport of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the sarcoplasm (cytosol) back into the lumen of the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR). Assume that all other cellular components, including voltage-gated channels, the ryanodine receptors responsible for $Ca^{2+}$ release, the contractile proteins (actin and myosin), and the availability of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), are all initially functioning correctly.\n\nIf this muscle fiber is subjected to a single electrical stimulus sufficient to trigger a normal, full release of $Ca^{2+}$ from the SR, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate and persistent state of the muscle fiber?\n\nA. The muscle fiber will contract and then be unable to relax, leading to a state of sustained contraction.\nB. The muscle fiber will be unable to contract at all because the initial release of $Ca^{2+}$ from the SR is prevented.\nC. The muscle fiber will immediately enter a state identical to rigor mortis, where myosin heads are permanently locked onto actin filaments.\nD. The troponin-tropomyosin complex will remain in its \"off\" position, continuously blocking the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments.\nE. The concentration of ATP in the sarcoplasm will rapidly increase, as a major ATP-consuming process (the SERCA pump) has been disabled.", "solution": "We analyze excitation-contraction coupling with explicit attention to calcium handling and cross-bridge cycling.\n\n1) In skeletal muscle, an electrical stimulus depolarizes the sarcolemma and T-tubules, activating the voltage sensors that mechanically gate the ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This produces a normal, rapid release flux of calcium ions from the SR lumen to the sarcoplasm. Denote the cytosolic calcium concentration by $[Ca^{2+}]$. A minimal dynamic balance for $[Ca^{2+}]$ is\n$$\n\\frac{d[Ca^{2+}]}{dt}=J_{\\text{rel}}-J_{\\text{SERCA}}-J_{\\text{efflux}},\n$$\nwhere $J_{\\text{rel}}$ is the SR release flux via ryanodine receptors, $J_{\\text{SERCA}}$ is the reuptake flux by SERCA, and $J_{\\text{efflux}}$ represents slower sarcolemmal removal processes (e.g., plasma membrane $Ca^{2+}$ transporters). The problem specifies a normal, full SR release upon stimulation, and that the ryanodine receptors and all other components are initially functioning normally.\n\n2) The pharmacological agent completely inhibits SERCA, so\n$$\nJ_{\\text{SERCA}}=0.\n$$\nImmediately after the stimulus, $J_{\\text{rel}}$ produces a large, rapid rise in $[Ca^{2+}]$. In the normal case, relaxation requires $J_{\\text{SERCA}}$ to lower $[Ca^{2+}]$ back to resting levels. With $J_{\\text{SERCA}}=0$, the dominant, rapid removal pathway is abolished. Consequently, after the release transient, the decay of $[Ca^{2+}]$ depends only on comparatively slow $J_{\\text{efflux}}$, so $[Ca^{2+}]$ remains elevated for a prolonged period.\n\n3) The activation of the thin filament is governed by $Ca^{2+}$ binding to troponin C, which shifts the troponin-tropomyosin complex to uncover myosin-binding sites on actin when $[Ca^{2+}]$ exceeds the activation threshold. Let $f_{\\text{on}}([Ca^{2+}])$ denote the fraction of regulatory units in the “on” state; it is an increasing function of $[Ca^{2+}]$. With persistently elevated $[Ca^{2+}]$ due to $J_{\\text{SERCA}}=0$, we have\n$$\n[Ca^{2+}]\\ \\text{elevated} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f_{\\text{on}}([Ca^{2+}])\\ \\text{high},\n$$\nso myosin-binding sites on actin remain exposed.\n\n4) Cross-bridge cycling requires ATP binding and hydrolysis by myosin. The problem states ATP is available and myosin is functional. Therefore, cross-bridges will cycle and generate tension as long as actin sites remain exposed. Because ATP is present, myosin heads are not “locked” to actin; lock-up (rigor) requires ATP depletion, which is explicitly not the case. Thus, the state is not identical to rigor mortis.\n\n5) Relaxation of skeletal muscle under normal conditions requires rapid resequestration of $Ca^{2+}$ into the SR by SERCA to reduce $[Ca^{2+}]$ below the level that maintains thin filament activation. With $J_{\\text{SERCA}}=0$, this mechanism is absent; hence, following the single stimulus and $Ca^{2+}$ release, the fiber will develop force and then be unable to relax on the normal timescale, entering a sustained contracture until slower, minor $Ca^{2+}$ extrusion pathways eventually lower $[Ca^{2+}]$. The “immediate and persistent” consequence after the stimulus is sustained contraction.\n\n6) Evaluate options:\n- A: Correct. The fiber contracts and cannot relax because $[Ca^{2+}]$ remains elevated without SERCA-mediated reuptake, maintaining thin filament activation and cross-bridge cycling.\n- B: Incorrect. Release is not prevented; ryanodine receptors function normally.\n- C: Incorrect. Rigor mortis requires ATP depletion; here ATP is available, so cross-bridges cycle rather than lock.\n- D: Incorrect. Elevated $[Ca^{2+}]$ moves troponin-tropomyosin to the “on” position, not the “off” position.\n- E: Incorrect. Although SERCA is a major ATP consumer and its inhibition reduces that specific consumption, sustained cross-bridge cycling greatly increases myosin ATPase consumption. There is no basis for a rapid increase of ATP concentration; cellular ATP is tightly regulated and would more likely be consumed by persistent contraction.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is sustained contraction following the stimulus with failure to relax.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1735185"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the calcium switch that initiates contraction, the cross-bridge cycle itself is an energy-dependent process.

The myofibril is initially placed in a solution that contains a high concentration of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and a sufficient supply of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which causes the sarcomeres to contract. After maximal contraction is achieved, the myofibril is rapidly transferred to a new solution. This new solution maintains the high concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions but also contains a potent metabolic inhibitor that completely and instantly halts all ATP synthesis and degrades any existing ATP molecules within the cell.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the molecular components within the sarcomeres of the myofibril immediately after the ATP has been fully depleted?\n\nA. Myosin heads will bind to actin, perform the power stroke, and then immediately detach, allowing the sarcomere to passively return to its resting length.\nB. Myosin heads will be unable to bind to the actin filaments because the troponin-tropomyosin complex will re-shield the binding sites on actin.\nC. Myosin heads will be firmly bound to the actin filaments in a fixed state and will be unable to detach.\nD. Myosin heads will bind to the actin filaments but will be arrested before they can perform the power stroke.\nE. The actin and myosin filaments will be completely dissociated from one another, and the sarcomere will be in a fully relaxed state.", "solution": "We analyze the cross-bridge cycle using the standard biochemical states, denoting myosin heads by $M$, actin by $A$, calcium ions by $Ca^{2+}$, adenosine triphosphate by $ATP$, adenosine diphosphate by $ADP$, and inorganic phosphate by $P_{i}$. The regulatory state of the thin filament depends on $Ca^{2+}$ binding to troponin C; at high $Ca^{2+}$, the troponin-tropomyosin complex moves so that myosin-binding sites on actin are exposed.\n\nThe cross-bridge cycle proceeds through the following steps when $Ca^{2+}$ is high and $ATP$ is available:\n1) Detachment requires $ATP$ binding:\n$$\nA\\cdot M + ATP \\to M\\cdot ATP + A.\n$$\n2) Cocking of the myosin head is driven by $ATP$ hydrolysis:\n$$\nM\\cdot ATP \\to M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}.\n$$\n3) Cross-bridge formation (with transition from weak to strong binding upon $P_{i}$ release) occurs when the cocked head encounters actin:\n$$\nM\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i} + A \\leftrightarrow A\\cdot M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}.\n$$\n4) The power stroke is coupled to $P_{i}$ release, followed by $ADP$ release, leaving the rigor complex:\n$$\nA\\cdot M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i} \\to A\\cdot M\\cdot ADP + P_{i} \\to A\\cdot M + ADP.\n$$\nA new $ATP$ molecule must bind to $A\\cdot M$ to cause detachment and continue cycling.\n\nIn the described experiment, the myofibril begins in high $Ca^{2+}$ with sufficient $ATP$, so the cycle runs and sarcomeres maximally shorten. The myofibril is then moved to a solution that maintains high $Ca^{2+}$ but instantly eliminates all $ATP$ by halting synthesis and degrading existing $ATP$. With $Ca^{2+}$ still high, the actin binding sites remain exposed; thus there is no re-shielding by the troponin-tropomyosin complex.\n\nOnce $ATP$ has been fully depleted, two key consequences follow from the reaction scheme:\n- Detachment from actin cannot occur because the step $A\\cdot M + ATP \\to M\\cdot ATP + A$ is impossible without $ATP$. Therefore any cross-bridges in the $A\\cdot M$ state remain strongly bound (rigor state).\n- Any heads that, at the instant of $ATP$ depletion, were in the $M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$ (cocked) state and encounter actin can still bind and release $P_{i}$ to perform a power stroke, because that step does not require additional $ATP$ binding. After $ADP$ release, these heads also enter the $A\\cdot M$ rigor state. No heads can subsequently detach without $ATP$.\n\nTherefore, with binding sites exposed by sustained high $Ca^{2+}$ and with $ATP$ absent, the stable immediate state is that myosin heads are firmly attached to actin in a fixed rigor complex and are unable to detach. This directly corresponds to option C. The other options are inconsistent with the requirement of $ATP$ for detachment (A and E), the continued exposure of binding sites at high $Ca^{2+}$ (B), and the fact that the power stroke can proceed from the cocked $M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$ state without new $ATP$ (D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1735221"}, {"introduction": "The troponin-tropomyosin complex in skeletal muscle is a classic regulatory model, but nature exhibits remarkable diversity in molecular control systems.
