This practice provides a stark quantitative look at this trade-off by comparing the water required to excrete nitrogen as ammonia versus urea [@problem_id:2574354]. By calculating the minimal urine volume under realistic physiological constraints, you will uncover the powerful selective pressure that drove the evolution of ureotelism in many animals.", "problem": "A central comparative question in zoology is how different nitrogen excretion strategies affect water economy under toxicity and osmotic constraints. Consider two strategies for excreting nitrogen produced from amino acid catabolism: ammonotelism (excreting as ammonia, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$) and ureotelism (excreting as urea, $\\mathrm{CO(NH_2)_2}$). You are asked to compute the minimal urine volume required to excrete a fixed nitrogen load under concentration constraints that reflect toxicity (for free ammonia) and achievable osmolarity (for urea), using only fundamental definitions.\n\nAssume a vertebrate must excrete $n_{N} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$ of nitrogen. The urine of this organism can safely maintain a free ammonia concentration of at most $C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, and can maintain a urea concentration of up to $C_{\\mathrm{urea}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ without exceeding osmotic design limits. Assume that the urine is well mixed, at steady state, and that to minimize water volume the excreted solute is brought to its allowable concentration bound. Ignore any acid–base speciation beyond the stated limit on free $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ and assume that the excreted nitrogen is carried exclusively by the named solute in each case.\n\nStarting only from the definition of molarity $C = n/V$ and the stoichiometry of nitrogen atoms per molecule of the excreted solute, derive expressions for the minimal urine volumes $V_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{urea}}$ needed to excrete the given $n_{N}$ when nitrogen is excreted as ammonia versus as urea, respectively. Then compute the fold-difference in minimal water requirement,\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}}{V_{\\mathrm{urea}}}.\n$$\n\nReport the single final answer as the exact value of $R$ (dimensionless). No rounding is required. If you compute intermediate volumes, express them in $\\mathrm{mL}$. Finally, in your reasoning (not in the final numeric answer), interpret how the value of $R$ reflects the water economy difference between ammonotelism and ureotelism under the stated constraints.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It poses a valid question in comparative physiology that can be resolved through the application of fundamental chemical and biological principles. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent with established scientific facts. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the minimal urine volumes, $V_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{urea}}$, required to excrete a fixed amount of nitrogen, $n_{N}$, and then to compute their ratio, $R$. The minimal volume is achieved when the concentration of the excreted solute reaches its maximum allowable limit. The governing equation is the definition of molarity, $C = n_{\\mathrm{solute}}/V$, rearranged to solve for volume:\n$$\nV = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{solute}}}{C}\n$$\nTo minimize $V$, we must use the maximum permissible concentration, $C^{\\mathrm{max}}$. The key step is to relate the moles of solute, $n_{\\mathrm{solute}}$, to the fixed quantity of nitrogen atoms to be excreted, $n_{N}$, through stoichiometry. We are given $n_{N} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mmol} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\n**Case 1: Ammonotelism (Excretion of Ammonia, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$)**\n\nFirst, we analyze the stoichiometry of ammonia. The molecule $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ contains one nitrogen atom. Consequently, to excrete $n_{N}$ moles of nitrogen atoms, an equal number of moles of ammonia must be excreted. Let $n_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ be the moles of ammonia.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = n_{N}\n$$\nGiven $n_{N} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$, we have:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\n$$\nThe maximum permissible concentration of free ammonia, dictated by its high toxicity, is given as $C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$. The minimal urine volume, $V_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$, is thus:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}}{C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{L}\n$$\nIn the requested units for intermediate results, this volume is $1000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**Case 2: Ureotelism (Excretion of Urea, $\\mathrm{CO(NH_2)_2}$)**\n\nNext, we analyze the stoichiometry of urea. The molecule $\\mathrm{CO(NH_2)_2}$ contains two nitrogen atoms. Therefore, to excrete $n_{N}$ moles of nitrogen atoms, only $n_{N}/2$ moles of urea are required. Let $n_{\\mathrm{urea}}$ be the moles of urea.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{urea}} = \\frac{n_{N}}{2}\n$$\nWith $n_{N} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$, we have:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{urea}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{2} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\n$$\nThe maximum concentration of urea, limited by the organism's osmotic capabilities, is given as $C_{\\mathrm{urea}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 100 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$. The minimal urine volume, $V_{\\mathrm{urea}}$, is:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{urea}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{urea}}}{C_{\\mathrm{urea}}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{100 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}} = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{L}\n$$\nIn the requested units for intermediate results, this volume is $5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio, $R$**\n\nThe final task is to compute the ratio $R \\equiv V_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} / V_{\\mathrm{urea}}$. We can perform this calculation symbolically to derive a general expression.\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = \\frac{n_{N}}{C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}}}\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{urea}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{urea}}}{C_{\\mathrm{urea}}} = \\frac{n_{N}/2}{C_{\\mathrm{urea}}} = \\frac{n_{N}}{2 \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{urea}}}\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$\nR = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}}{V_{\\mathrm{urea}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_{N}}{C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{n_{N}}{2 \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{urea}}}\\right)} = \\frac{n_{N}}{C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}}} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{urea}}}{n_{N}}\n$$\nThe term $n_{N}$ cancels, indicating that the relative water cost is independent of the amount of nitrogen to be excreted.\n$$\nR = \\frac{2 \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{urea}}}{C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values for the concentrations:\n$$\nR = \\frac{2 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{mM})}{1\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = 200\n$$\nAlternatively, using the calculated numerical volumes yields the same dimensionless result:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 200\n$$\nThe value $R = 200$ demonstrates that under these physiological constraints, excreting nitrogen as ammonia requires $200$ times more water than excreting it as urea. This massive difference in water economy is a result of two compounding factors: the superior stoichiometric efficiency of urea in carrying nitrogen ($2$ atoms per molecule versus $1$), and the drastically lower toxicity of urea, which permits a $100$-fold higher concentration in urine compared to ammonia. The product of these factors, $2 \\times 100$, yields the total calculated advantage of $200$. This quantitatively illustrates a fundamental principle driving the evolution of nitrogen metabolism in water-limited terrestrial and marine environments.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{200}\n$$", "id": "2574354"}, {"introduction": "For animals in arid environments, even the water required for urea excretion can be too costly, leading to the evolution of uricotelism. While excreting nearly-solid uric acid is a masterclass in water conservation, it introduces a new challenge: its very low solubility can lead to harmful precipitation in tissues [@problem_id:1748549].

During the exposed period, it must seal its shell to prevent desiccation and cannot excrete. Thus, waste produced during this time must be stored internally.\n\nThe model considers two mutually exclusive strategies for managing waste during the exposed period:\n\n**Strategy A (Constant Ammonotely):** The barnacle stores all nitrogen waste produced during the exposed period as ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$).
