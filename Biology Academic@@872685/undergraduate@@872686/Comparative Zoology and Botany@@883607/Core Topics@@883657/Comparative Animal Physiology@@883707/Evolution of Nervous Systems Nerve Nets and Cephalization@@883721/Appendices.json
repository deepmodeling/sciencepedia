This first exercise uses a simplified model to explore one of the most fundamental of these advantages: the speed of information processing. By comparing the time required to initiate a coordinated, whole-body response in a radial versus a cephalized body plan, you can quantitatively appreciate why directed, rapid movement is so closely linked to the evolution of a head [@problem_id:1747183].", "problem": "To explore the functional consequences of different nervous system architectures, consider two simplified animal models.\n\nThe first, a \"Radial Model,\" is inspired by an adult echinoderm like a starfish. Its nervous system consists of a central nerve ring of radius $R$ from which five identical arms of length $L$ extend radially outward.\n\nThe second, a \"Cephalized Model,\" represents a typical bilaterally symmetric animal. Its nervous system is organized along a body of total length $B$, with a primary processing center (a ganglion or \"brain\") located at its anterior end and a main nerve cord running the length of the body.\n\nBoth animals detect a potentially harmful stimulus at their periphery. The Radial Model is touched at the extreme tip of one of its arms. The Cephalized Model is touched at its posterior tip. In both cases, a nerve signal travels from the point of stimulus towards the central processing areas. The speed of this signal, $v$, is the same in both models and along all nerve pathways.\n\nWe define the \"Information Integration Time\" as the duration required for the signal to travel from the stimulus point to the functionally most distant point of the main processing structure. This time represents the minimum delay before a coordinated, whole-body response can be initiated.\n- For the Radial Model, the main processing structure is the nerve ring. The integration time is the time taken for the signal to travel from the arm tip to the ring, and then from its entry point on the ring to the diametrically opposite point.\n- For the Cephalized Model, the main processing structure is the anterior ganglion. The integration time is the time taken for the signal to travel from the posterior tip to this ganglion.\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison between these two body plans, we set the maximum physical span of both models to be equal, meaning the length of the Cephalized Model is equal to the diameter of the Radial Model: $B = 2(R+L)$. Furthermore, the internal proportions of the Radial Model are such that the length of an arm is four times the radius of the central ring, i.e., $L=4R$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the Information Integration Time for the Radial Model, $T_{\\text{radial}}$, to that of the Cephalized Model, $T_{\\text{cephalized}}$.

The shortest path along the ring is half the circumference, which has arc length $\\pi R$ because the full circumference is $2\\pi R$.\n- With constant signal speed $v$, the integration time is\n$$\nT_{\\text{radial}}=\\frac{L}{v}+\\frac{\\pi R}{v}=\\frac{L+\\pi R}{v}.\n$$\n\nFor the Cephalized Model:\n- Distance from posterior tip to the anterior ganglion is the full body length $B$.\n- With signal speed $v$, the integration time is\n$$\nT_{\\text{cephalized}}=\\frac{B}{v}.\n$$\n\nImposed geometric constraints:\n- Equal maximum span: $B=2(R+L)$.\n- Proportion within the radial model: $L=4R$.\n\nThe ratio of integration times is\n$$\n\\frac{T_{\\text{radial}}}{T_{\\text{cephalized}}}=\\frac{(L+\\pi R)/v}{B/v}=\\frac{L+\\pi R}{B}.\n$$\nSubstitute $B=2(R+L)$ to obtain\n$$\n\\frac{T_{\\text{radial}}}{T_{\\text{cephalized}}}=\\frac{L+\\pi R}{2(R+L)}.\n$$\nNow use $L=4R$:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{\\text{radial}}}{T_{\\text{cephalized}}}=\\frac{4R+\\pi R}{2(R+4R)}=\\frac{R(4+\\pi)}{2\\cdot 5R}=\\frac{4+\\pi}{10}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4+\\pi}{10}}$$", "id": "1747183"}, {"introduction": "While rapid signal transmission is crucial, the true power of a centralized nervous system lies in its ability to integrate information and make reliable decisions. What happens when a nervous system can sense but cannot compute? This thought experiment explores the computational limits of a diffuse nerve net by modeling an organism's choice at a simple T-junction [@problem_id:1747161]. Through this probabilistic analysis, you will discover why simply adding more sensors is insufficient for complex behavior, highlighting the profound evolutionary pressure for central integration.", "problem": "A hypothetical, radially symmetric, disc-shaped marine organism, *Nectoria simplex*, navigates its environment using a primitive, diffuse nerve net. Its sensory and motor systems are comprised of a continuous ring of identical, independent sensory-motor units distributed uniformly along its circular perimeter. The organism is placed at the entrance of a T-junction in a maze. A food source is located at the end of the right-hand path, while the left-hand path is a dead end.\n\nThe food emits a chemical that creates a concentration gradient at the junction. The organism's front-facing half, which is oriented towards the two paths, detects this gradient. Due to the food's location, the sensory units on the right-front quadrant of the organism's body (from $0$ to $\\pi/2$ radians relative to the forward direction) experience an average chemical concentration of $C_R = C_0(1+\\epsilon)$. The units on the left-front quadrant (from $0$ to $-\\pi/2$ radians) experience an average concentration of $C_L = C_0(1-\\epsilon)$. Here, $C_0$ is a baseline concentration and $\\epsilon$ is a small, positive, dimensionless constant representing the strength of the gradient across the organism's body.\n\nThe nervous system of *Nectoria simplex* is non-integrating. Each sensory-motor unit acts as an independent trigger. The rate at which any single unit \"fires\" (initiates a motor response) is directly proportional to the local chemical concentration it detects. The organism's turning \"decision\" is determined by the very first sensory-motor unit that fires on its front-facing half. If the first unit to fire is on the right-front quadrant, the organism commits to a right turn. If the first unit to fire is on the left-front quadrant, it commits to a left turn.\n\nGiven that the gradient strength is $\\epsilon = 0.080$ and that the number of sensory-motor units on the front-facing half is large, what is the probability that *Nectoria simplex* makes the correct turn towards the food?\n\nA. 0.500\n\nB. 0.540\n\nC. 0.580\n\nD. 0.920\n\nE. The probability cannot be determined without knowing the total number of sensory units.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that the organism turns right, which is the event that the first sensory-motor unit to fire is located on the right-front quadrant. This is a classic competing risks or race condition problem, which can be modeled using Poisson processes.\n\nLet $r$ be the firing rate (events per unit time) of a single sensory-motor unit. The problem states that this rate is directly proportional to the local chemical concentration $C$. So, we can write $r = kC$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nLet's denote the right-front quadrant as 'R' and the left-front quadrant as 'L'.\nThe concentration on the right side is $C_R = C_0(1+\\epsilon)$.\nThe concentration on the left side is $C_L = C_0(1-\\epsilon)$.\n\nThe firing rate of a single unit on the right side is $r_R = k C_R = k C_0(1+\\epsilon)$.\nThe firing rate of a single unit on the left side is $r_L = k C_L = k C_0(1-\\epsilon)$.\n\nThe organism's sensory ring is continuous, which is equivalent to having a very large number of discrete units. Let's consider the total firing rate from each quadrant. Since the units are independent, the total firing rate from a collection of units is the sum of their individual rates. The problem describes the units as being uniformly distributed. Let's assume there are $N$ units on the right-front quadrant and $N$ units on the left-front quadrant.\n\nThe total firing rate from all units on the right side is:\n$$R_{total, R} = N \\cdot r_R = N k C_0(1+\\epsilon)$$\n\nThe total firing rate from all units on the left side is:\n$$R_{total, L} = N \\cdot r_L = N k C_0(1-\\epsilon)$$\n\nThe organism's turn is determined by the first firing event across its entire front-facing half. The overall process of a \"first fire\" event is the combination of the two competing Poisson processes (firing from the left vs. firing from the right). The total rate of any firing event occurring on the front half is the sum of the rates from both sides:\n$$R_{overall} = R_{total, R} + R_{total, L}$$\n$$R_{overall} = N k C_0(1+\\epsilon) + N k C_0(1-\\epsilon)$$\n$$R_{overall} = N k C_0 (1+\\epsilon + 1-\\epsilon) = 2 N k C_0$$\n\nFor two independent Poisson processes with rates $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, the probability that the first event comes from process 1 is given by the ratio of its rate to the total rate: $P_1 = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2}$.\n\nIn our case, the probability that the first firing unit is on the right side, $P(\\text{Right Turn})$, is the ratio of the total right-side firing rate to the overall firing rate.\n$$P(\\text{Right Turn}) = \\frac{R_{total, R}}{R_{overall}}$$\n$$P(\\text{Right Turn}) = \\frac{N k C_0(1+\\epsilon)}{2 N k C_0}$$\n\nWe can cancel the common terms $N$, $k$, and $C_0$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$P(\\text{Right Turn}) = \\frac{1+\\epsilon}{2}$$\n\nThis result is profoundly important. It shows that for this simple, non-integrating nervous system, the probability of making a correct choice is independent of the number of sensory units $N$. The organism's performance is limited solely by the local gradient strength $\\epsilon$. This highlights the computational inadequacy of a diffuse nerve net for such a task; adding more sensors does not improve decision accuracy because there is no mechanism to integrate or average the information.\n\nNow, we substitute the given value of $\\epsilon = 0.080$ into our derived expression:\n$$P(\\text{Right Turn}) = \\frac{1 + 0.080}{2} = \\frac{1.080}{2} = 0.540$$\n\nThe probability that *Nectoria simplex* makes the correct turn towards the food is 0.540. This corresponds to option B. Option E is incorrect because, as shown in the derivation, the probability is independent of the number of sensory units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1747161"}, {"introduction": "To study the evolution of intelligence on a grand scale, biologists need tools to make fair comparisons of brain size across animals of vastly different body masses.
