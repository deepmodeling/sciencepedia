Its function relies on a remarkable property known as cooperativity, which involves a conformational change between two states. The \"T\" or tense state has a low affinity for oxygen and is predominant in low oxygen environments. The \"R\" or relaxed state has a high affinity for oxygen and becomes favored as oxygen molecules bind. This transition allows hemoglobin to efficiently load oxygen in the high partial pressure environment of the lungs and unload it in the low partial pressure environment of the tissues.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic condition where a mutation causes the hemoglobin molecule to be exceptionally stable in its T-state. This mutated hemoglobin very rarely transitions to the R-state, even when exposed to the high partial pressure of oxygen found in the pulmonary capillaries. Which of the following statements best describes the primary physiological consequence for an individual with this condition?\n\nA. Oxygen loading in the lungs is severely impaired, leading to systemic hypoxia.\n\nB. Oxygen unloading in the peripheral tissues is severely impaired, causing oxygen to be trapped in the blood.\n\nC. The total oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is significantly increased to compensate for the low affinity.\n\nD. The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted significantly to the left.\n\nE. Enhanced binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin leads to respiratory acidosis.", "solution": "Hemoglobin exhibits cooperative binding described qualitatively by a T (tense, low-affinity) to R (relaxed, high-affinity) conformational transition. Cooperative saturation can be summarized by a Hill-type relation,\n$$\nY(p_{O_{2}})=\\frac{p_{O_{2}}^{n}}{P_{50}^{n}+p_{O_{2}}^{n}},\n$$\nwhere $Y$ is fractional saturation, $n$ is the Hill coefficient, and $P_{50}$ is the partial pressure at which $Y=\\frac{1}{2}$. Lower affinity corresponds to a larger $P_{50}$ and a rightward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.\n\nIn an allosteric framework (e.g., Monod-Wyman-Changeux), the equilibrium between T and R states is governed by an allosteric constant $L=\\frac{[T_{0}]}{[R_{0}]}$. A mutation that stabilizes the T state increases $L$ markedly, thereby strongly favoring T over R even at high $p_{O_{2}}$. Consequently, the effective affinity remains low and the T-to-R transition required for high saturation is impeded.\n\nIn the lungs, $p_{O_{2}}$ is high under normal physiology, which ordinarily drives hemoglobin toward the R state and achieves high $Y$. With the T state pathologically stabilized, $Y$ remains abnormally low even at pulmonary $p_{O_{2}}$, implying impaired oxygen loading.\n\nThe arterial oxygen content is\n$$\nC_{aO_{2}}=1.34\\,[\\mathrm{Hb}]\\,S_{aO_{2}}+0.003\\,p_{aO_{2}},\n$$\nwhere $S_{aO_{2}}=Y(p_{aO_{2}})$. With $Y$ reduced due to persistent T-state dominance, $C_{aO_{2}}$ falls despite normal $p_{aO_{2}}$, producing systemic hypoxia.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Consistent with the analysis. Stabilized T state causes reduced affinity, right shift, impaired loading in lungs, and systemic hypoxia.\n- B: Would apply to stabilized R state (left shift, high affinity), which traps oxygen and impairs unloading; this is the opposite of the given condition.\n- C: Total oxygen-carrying capacity is set primarily by $[\\mathrm{Hb}]$ and is not increased by reduced affinity; the content actually decreases due to low saturation.\n- D: A left shift indicates increased affinity; the T-state stabilization causes a right shift.\n- E: Deoxygenated hemoglobin can carry more carbon dioxide and protons (Haldane and Bohr effects), but the primary consequence here is impaired oxygen loading and hypoxia; respiratory acidosis is not the primary effect.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the primary physiological consequence is impaired oxygen loading in the lungs leading to systemic hypoxia.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1749350"}, {"introduction": "While vertebrates rely on iron-based hemoglobin, many invertebrates like crustaceans have evolved a different solution: copper-based hemocyanin.

The affinity of the T state is known to be pH-dependent, a phenomenon analogous to the Bohr effect in hemoglobin. This dependence is attributed to a single ionizable amino acid residue near the binding site. The protonation of this residue destabilizes bound oxygen, increasing the dissociation rate.
