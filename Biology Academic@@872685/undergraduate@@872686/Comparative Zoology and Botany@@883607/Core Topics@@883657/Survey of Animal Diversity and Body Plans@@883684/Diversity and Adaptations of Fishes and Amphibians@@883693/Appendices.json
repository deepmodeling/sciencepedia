Fishes have evolved a remarkably efficient solution in their gills using a principle known as countercurrent exchange. This exercise allows you to quantitatively compare this sophisticated adaptation against a simpler concurrent flow system, revealing the profound physical advantages that have made it a cornerstone of aquatic respiration. [@problem_id:1743772]", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical fish gill system designed for aquatic respiration. The partial pressure of dissolved oxygen in the water entering the gills, $P_{\\text{water_in}}$, is 150 mmHg. The partial pressure of oxygen in the deoxygenated blood arriving at the gills from the systemic circulation, $P_{\\text{blood_in}}$, is 40 mmHg. For this model, assume that the flow rates of water across the gills and blood through the gill lamellae are identical and that the gas exchange surface is perfectly efficient, meaning diffusion is not a limiting factor.\n\nWe define the oxygen extraction efficiency of the gill as the ratio of the actual increase in the blood's oxygen partial pressure to the maximum possible increase. The maximum possible increase is defined as the difference between the incoming water's partial pressure and the incoming blood's partial pressure ($P_{\\text{water_in}} - P_{\\text{blood_in}}$).\n\nBased on this model, calculate the theoretical maximum oxygen extraction efficiency for two different architectural arrangements: a concurrent exchange system (where blood and water flow in the same direction) and a countercurrent exchange system (where blood and water flow in opposite directions).

Therefore $P_{w}+P_{b}$ is constant along the exchanger, and for cocurrent flow the constant equals the sum at the common inlet end:\n$$\nP_{w}(x)+P_{b}(x)=P_{w,\\text{in}}+P_{b,\\text{in}}.\n$$\n- In the limit of very large area (perfect exchange), the two streams approach equilibrium at the outlet, so $P_{w,\\text{out}}=P_{b,\\text{out}}$.

This adaptation, however, creates a delicate balancing act between respiration and osmoregulation, as the skin becomes a major interface for water movement. This problem challenges you to think like a physiologist, using principles of diffusion and osmosis to predict how an environmental change—a shift in water salinity—impacts the effectiveness of cutaneous respiration. [@problem_id:1743781]", "problem": "A common frog (*Rana temporaria*) is an amphibian that relies on both pulmonary (lung) and cutaneous (skin) respiration. For cutaneous respiration to be effective, the skin must remain moist, allowing atmospheric oxygen to dissolve in a thin film of water before diffusing across the epidermis into the blood capillaries below. Consider a healthy frog that has been living in a freshwater pond. This pond is essentially a hypotonic environment relative to the frog's internal body fluids. The frog is then carefully transferred to a tank containing mildly brackish water, which is slightly hypertonic to the frog's body fluids.\n\nAssuming the frog survives this transition and begins to acclimate, what is the most likely immediate effect on the rate of its cutaneous respiration, and why?\n\nA. The rate will increase to compensate for the higher metabolic energy required for osmoregulation in the new environment.\n\nB. The rate will decrease because osmotic water loss from the skin will cause it to dry out, thickening the diffusion barrier for oxygen.\n\nC. The rate will remain unchanged, as cutaneous respiration is primarily driven by the partial pressure gradient of oxygen, which is unaffected by water salinity.\n\nD. The rate will increase because the ions in the brackish water act as cotransporters, facilitating the movement of oxygen across the skin.\n\nE. The rate will fluctuate unpredictably as the frog's osmoregulatory system struggles to adapt to the new ionic balance.", "solution": "We analyze cutaneous oxygen uptake using Fick’s law for diffusion. The molar flux density of oxygen across the skin can be written as\n$$\nJ_{O_{2}} \\;=\\; D\\,\\frac{\\Delta C_{O_{2}}}{\\Delta x},\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the medium that constitutes the diffusion path, $\\Delta C_{O_{2}}$ is the concentration difference across the path, and $\\Delta x$ is the effective thickness of the diffusion barrier. Using Henry’s law, $C_{O_{2}}=\\alpha P_{O_{2}}$, with $\\alpha$ the solubility of oxygen in the medium and $P_{O_{2}}$ the partial pressure of oxygen, this becomes\n$$\nJ_{O_{2}} \\;=\\; D\\,\\alpha\\,\\frac{\\Delta P_{O_{2}}}{\\Delta x} \\;\\equiv\\; K\\,\\frac{\\Delta P_{O_{2}}}{\\Delta x},\n$$\nwhere $K=D\\alpha$ is the Krogh diffusion constant.

With $\\pi_{\\text{ext}}>\\pi_{\\text{int}}$ and negligible $\\Delta P$, we have $J_{w}<0$ (net water efflux from the frog), causing immediate dehydration of the skin surface layers and reduction of the external aqueous film that normally facilitates oxygen dissolution and diffusion.\n\nThis osmotic water loss has two direct consequences for $ \\dot{V}_{O_{2}}$:\n1) The effective diffusion barrier is altered such that the hydrated pathway becomes less hydrated. This increases the effective path length and tortuosity and reduces permeability, which is captured by a decrease in $K$ (both $D$ and the tissue’s effective $\\alpha$ for oxygen drop when the medium is less aqueous and more tissue-dominated). In equivalent resistance form, $R=\\frac{\\Delta x}{A K}$ increases, so $\\dot{V}_{O_{2}}=\\frac{\\Delta P_{O_{2}}}{R}$ decreases.\n2) The salinity of the external medium decreases oxygen solubility $\\alpha$ in the boundary layer water by a salting-out effect, which further reduces $K=D\\alpha$ even if $\\Delta P_{O_{2}}$ is unchanged.\n\nBecause the immediate dominant effect is decreased skin hydration and reduced external solubility, the cutaneous diffusion capacity falls acutely. Although the frog’s osmoregulatory costs may rise, cutaneous oxygen uptake is not actively upregulated; instead, the physical capacity for diffusion decreases. Therefore the most likely immediate effect is a decrease in the rate of cutaneous respiration due to osmotic water loss increasing the effective diffusion barrier.\n\nOption B matches this outcome; options A, C, D, and E are inconsistent with the immediate, physics-based changes in permeability and solubility governing Fickian diffusion across the skin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1743781"}, {"introduction": "Beyond individual physiological traits, evolution shapes life history strategies that optimize reproductive success in fluctuating environments.
