This process, known as anterograde axonal transport, is driven by the molecular motor protein kinesin-1. Kinesin-1 moves along microtubule tracks, hydrolyzing one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) for each step it takes.\n\nConsider a motor neuron where the axon has a total length of $L = 1.5 \\text{ mm}$. A single kinesin-1 motor protein is tasked with carrying a vesicle along this entire length. The kinesin-1 motor has a consistent step size of $d = 8.0 \\text{ nm}$ for every molecule of ATP it consumes. Under physiological conditions, this specific motor maintains a constant average rate of ATP hydrolysis of $R = 85 \\text{ molecules per second}$.\n\nAssuming the motor moves continuously without pausing or detaching, calculate the total time it will take for the vesicle to be transported from the cell body to the axon terminal.
