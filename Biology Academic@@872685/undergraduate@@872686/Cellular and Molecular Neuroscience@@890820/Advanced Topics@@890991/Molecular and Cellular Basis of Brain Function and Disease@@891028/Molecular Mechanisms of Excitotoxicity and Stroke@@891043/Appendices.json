Understanding this initial osmotic catastrophe is the first step in grasping the full scope of ischemic brain injury.", "problem": "In the context of cellular and molecular neuroscience, consider a neuron under physiological stress. During the early stages of cerebral ischemia, which occurs when blood flow to the brain is insufficient, the supply of oxygen and glucose is severely limited. This leads to a rapid depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A primary consequence of this ATP depletion is the failure of the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase ion pump, an enzyme crucial for maintaining neuronal resting membrane potential. The failure of this pump results in a massive, uncontrolled influx of sodium ions ($Na^+$) into the neuron's cytoplasm. This event is a critical trigger for a condition known as cytotoxic edema, where the neuron rapidly swells.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and immediate biophysical explanation for this ischemia-induced cellular swelling?\n\nA. The influx of sodium ions increases the total intracellular solute concentration, creating an osmotic gradient that drives water into the cell.\n\nB. The Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase pump, when failing, reverses its function and begins to actively transport water into the neuron.\n\nC. The increase in intracellular sodium directly increases the hydrostatic pressure inside the cell, forcing it to expand.\n\nD. The sodium ions chemically react with cytoplasmic proteins, causing them to unfold and increase in volume.\n\nE. The electrical depolarization caused by sodium influx weakens the structure of the cell membrane, allowing it to stretch and passively absorb extracellular fluid.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the immediate biophysical consequence of ATP depletion during early cerebral ischemia. The Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase normally maintains ionic gradients by exporting $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and importing $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$. ATP depletion halts this pump, so $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ enters the neuron down its electrochemical gradient via leaks and transporters. Electrically, charge neutrality is maintained by accompanying anions (often $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$) or existing impermeant intracellular anions, but the key effect is an increase in the effective intracellular osmolyte concentration.\n\nLet $c_{\\text{in}}$ and $c_{\\text{out}}$ denote the total effective osmolyte concentrations inside and outside the cell, respectively (sum over osmotically active solutes, each weighted by its reflection coefficient). For an ideal dilute solution, the osmotic pressure is given by the van ’t Hoff relation:\n$$\n\\Pi = R T \\sum_{i} c_{i},\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is absolute temperature. For a semipermeable membrane characterized by reflection coefficient $\\sigma_{i}$ for solute $i$, the effective contribution to the osmotic driving force is $\\sigma_{i} R T \\Delta c_{i}$, so the net osmotic pressure difference across the neuronal membrane is\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi \\equiv \\Pi_{\\text{in}} - \\Pi_{\\text{out}} = R T \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{i} \\left(c_{i,\\text{in}} - c_{i,\\text{out}}\\right).\n$$\nBecause water permeability is high (via aquaporins and bilayer), and small ions like $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ are relatively restricted on the timescale of early ischemia (so $\\sigma_{i} \\approx 1$ for these solutes), the influx of $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ increases $c_{\\text{in}}$, thereby increasing $\\Pi_{\\text{in}}$ and making $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$.\n\nWater flux across the membrane is described by the Kedem–Katchalsky relation for volume flow:\n$$\nJ_{v} = L_{p} \\left(\\Delta P - \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{i} R T \\Delta c_{i}\\right) = L_{p} \\left(\\Delta P - \\Delta \\Pi\\right),\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic permeability and $\\Delta P \\equiv P_{\\text{in}} - P_{\\text{out}}$ is the hydrostatic pressure difference. Immediately after pump failure, $\\Delta P \\approx 0$, so\n$$\nJ_{v} \\approx - L_{p} \\Delta \\Pi.\n$$\nWith $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$, this implies water flows into the cell (sign convention: negative $J_{v}$ corresponds to inward water flux when $\\Delta \\Pi$ is defined as above), increasing cell volume and producing cytotoxic edema. The swelling proceeds until rising intracellular hydrostatic pressure and membrane-cytoskeletal tension increase $\\Delta P$ to balance $\\Delta \\Pi$, satisfying $J_{v} = 0$ at equilibrium:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\Delta \\Pi.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A correctly states that increased intracellular $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ raises intracellular osmolality, generating an osmotic gradient that drives water influx, as quantified by the van ’t Hoff and Kedem–Katchalsky relations above.\n- B is incorrect because the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase does not reverse to pump water; it is an ion pump, and water transport is passive via osmotic and hydraulic driving forces, not active pumping by this enzyme.\n- C is incorrect because intracellular hydrostatic pressure does not increase directly from $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ accumulation; rather, hydrostatic pressure rises secondarily due to osmotic water influx.\n- D is incorrect because there is no immediate chemical unfolding of proteins by $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ that explains the rapid swelling; the dominant mechanism is osmotic.\n- E is incorrect because membrane depolarization does not directly weaken bilayer mechanics to allow bulk fluid uptake; again, osmotic forces dominate.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and immediate biophysical explanation is the osmotic water influx driven by increased intracellular solute concentration due to $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ accumulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2343433"}, {"introduction": "While excitotoxicity is named for excessive glutamate-driven excitation, a critical and often overlooked aspect of the pathology is the simultaneous collapse of synaptic inhibition.

The splicing decision is controlled by a Splicing Factor Protein (SFP). SFP can be phosphorylated by a glutamate-sensitive Kinase E, converting it to its phosphorylated form, SFP-p.
