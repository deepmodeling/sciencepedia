This exercise applies fundamental Mendelian principles to a common inheritance scenario, where one parent is heterozygous for the pathogenic *HTT* allele and the other is unaffected. By working through this problem, you can calculate the baseline risk of transmission for this autosomal dominant disorder, a foundational skill for understanding genetic diseases [@problem_id:2343311].", "problem": "Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene (*HTT*). The number of repeats determines the clinical outcome. The classification of *HTT* alleles is as follows:\n- Normal alleles: Fewer than 27 CAG repeats.\n- Intermediate alleles: 27 to 35 CAG repeats. Individuals with these alleles do not develop the disease but have an increased risk of having children with an expanded, disease-causing allele.\n- Reduced-penetrance alleles: 36 to 39 CAG repeats. Individuals may or may not develop the symptoms of Huntington's disease in their lifetime.\n- Full-penetrance alleles: 40 or more CAG repeats. Individuals with these alleles will develop Huntington's disease, assuming they live a normal lifespan.\n\nA person undergoes genetic testing and is found to be heterozygous for the *HTT* gene, with one allele having 15 CAG repeats and the other having 42 CAG repeats. This individual's partner has also been tested and has two normal alleles with 18 and 23 repeats, respectively.\n\nAssuming simple Mendelian inheritance and that the number of repeats in these alleles is stable and does not change during gamete formation, calculate the probability that a child conceived by this couple will possess at least one full-penetrance *HTT* allele. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "We represent the heterozygous individual’s alleles as one normal allele with 15 repeats and one full-penetrance allele with 42 repeats. Denote the full-penetrance allele as $F$ (42 repeats) and the normal allele as $N$ (15 repeats), so the genotype is $N/F$. The partner has two normal alleles with 18 and 23 repeats, which we denote collectively as normal alleles $N$, so the partner’s genotype is $N/N$.\n\nUnder simple Mendelian inheritance with stable repeat numbers and equal segregation, each parent contributes one allele to the child with equal probability from their two alleles. Therefore, the gametes from the $N/F$ parent are $N$ and $F$ with probabilities\n$$\nP(G_{1}=N)=\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(G_{1}=F)=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThe partner’s gametes are both normal, so\n$$\nP(G_{2}=\\text{normal})=1.\n$$\n\nA child will possess at least one full-penetrance allele if and only if it inherits the $F$ allele from the $N/F$ parent, because the partner has no full-penetrance alleles to contribute.
