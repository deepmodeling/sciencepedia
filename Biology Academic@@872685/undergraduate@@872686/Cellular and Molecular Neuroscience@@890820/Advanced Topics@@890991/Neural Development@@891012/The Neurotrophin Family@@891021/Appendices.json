A core principle of this process is that neurons depend on target-derived signals for their survival. This exercise [@problem_id:2353366] asks you to apply the fundamental concept of ligand-receptor specificity—the idea that a signaling molecule like a neurotrophin will only activate a cell if that cell expresses the correct receptor. By predicting neuronal survival based on a simple experimental setup, you can test your understanding of how this molecular \"lock-and-key\" mechanism forms the basis of neural circuit formation.", "problem": "A developmental neurobiologist is investigating the survival requirements of a newly isolated population of neurons from the central nervous system. Using molecular techniques, the researcher determines that these neurons express a high density of Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors on their surface but completely lack the expression of Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptors.\n\nTo test the functional consequences of this receptor profile, the researcher prepares two separate, identical cell cultures of these neurons in a basal medium that lacks any growth factors.\n- To Culture A, the researcher adds Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).\n- To Culture B, the researcher adds Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).\n\nAssuming that cell survival in this context is entirely dependent on the activation of either TrkA or TrkB signaling pathways, predict the most likely outcome for the neurons in each culture after a sufficient incubation period.\n\nA. Neurons in both Culture A and Culture B will survive.\n\nB. Neurons in Culture A will survive, while neurons in Culture B will not.\n\nC.

Neurons in both Culture A and Culture B will undergo rapid apoptosis induced by the neurotrophins.", "solution": "The neurons are characterized by high surface expression of TrkB and complete absence of TrkA, which can be summarized as $\\text{TrkB} \\text{ present}$ and $\\text{TrkA} = 0$. Neurotrophin receptor specificity dictates that NGF is the cognate ligand for TrkA, while BDNF is the cognate ligand for TrkB, which can be represented as $\\text{NGF} \\Rightarrow \\text{TrkA activation}$ and $\\text{BDNF} \\Rightarrow \\text{TrkB activation}$.\n\nBy the problem’s assumption, neuronal survival in this setup depends entirely on activation of either TrkA or TrkB. Define a survival state variable $S$ such that $S=1$ (survival) if and only if $(\\text{TrkA active}) \\lor (\\text{TrkB active})$, and $S=0$ (no survival) otherwise.\n\nFor Culture A, NGF is added in the absence of TrkA. Because $\\text{TrkA} = 0$, NGF cannot activate any Trk receptor, so $\\text{TrkA active} = 0$. There is no BDNF present, so $\\text{TrkB active} = 0$. Therefore, $S=0$ for Culture A, implying the neurons will not survive.\n\nFor Culture B, BDNF is added and TrkB is expressed at high density. Thus BDNF binds and activates TrkB, giving $\\text{TrkB active} = 1$. By the stated dependency, this is sufficient for survival, so $S=1$ for Culture B, implying the neurons will survive.\n\nTherefore, neurons in Culture B will survive, while neurons in Culture A will not, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353366"}, {"introduction": "Neurotrophin signaling is more nuanced than a simple on-switch for survival. The same neurotrophin can deliver opposing messages of life or death, depending on its molecular form and the type of receptor it engages. This practice [@problem_id:2353347] delves into this fascinating duality by contrasting the effects of a mature neurotrophin binding to a Trk receptor with its precursor form, a \"pro-neurotrophin,\" binding to the p75NTR receptor. Working through a scenario involving genetic manipulation will challenge you to think like a neuroscientist and dissect how a single signaling system can mediate such dramatically different cell fates.", "problem": "In the developing peripheral nervous system, the survival of distinct neuronal populations is exquisitely regulated by target-derived neurotrophic factors. One such factor is Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which is initially synthesized as a precursor protein, pro-NT-3. In the extracellular space, pro-NT-3 is typically cleaved by proteases into its mature, active form, NT-3.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following simplified signaling rules:\n1.  Mature NT-3 binds with high affinity to the Tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC), and this interaction robustly promotes cell survival.\n2.  The precursor, pro-NT-3, does not bind effectively to TrkC but binds with high affinity to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). This interaction, in the absence of significant Trk receptor signaling, actively promotes apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mouse model in which the cleavage site on the pro-NT-3 molecule has been mutated, rendering it completely resistant to proteolytic processing. In this model, only pro-NT-3 is secreted, and no mature NT-3 is formed. During a critical developmental window, two specific neuronal populations rely on this neurotrophin source for survival signals.\n-   **Population 1:** Proprioceptive sensory neurons, which primarily express the TrkC receptor to ensure their survival.\n-   **Population 2:** A subset of cutaneous nociceptive (pain-sensing) neurons, which are characterized by high expression of the p75NTR receptor and negligible expression of any Trk receptors.\n\nBased on the provided signaling rules, predict the most likely consequence for the survival of these two neuronal populations in the genetically engineered mice compared to normal, wild-type mice.\n\nA. Increased survival of proprioceptive neurons and decreased survival of nociceptors.\n\nB. Decreased survival of proprioceptive neurons and increased survival of nociceptors.\n\nC. Decreased survival for both proprioceptive neurons and nociceptors.\n\nD. Increased survival for both proprioceptive neurons and nociceptors.\n\nE. No significant change in survival for either neuronal population.", "solution": "We begin by restating the signaling rules:\n- Mature NT-3 binds TrkC with high affinity and promotes survival.\n- Pro-NT-3 does not effectively bind TrkC but binds p75NTR with high affinity and, in the absence of significant Trk signaling, promotes apoptosis.\n\nIn the engineered mice, the cleavage site mutation prevents conversion of pro-NT-3 to mature NT-3. Therefore, only pro-NT-3 is present in the extracellular space; no mature NT-3 is available.\n\nApply these rules to each neuronal population:\n- Proprioceptive sensory neurons (Population 1) primarily express TrkC and rely on mature NT-3 for survival signaling. Because mature NT-3 is absent and pro-NT-3 does not activate TrkC, these neurons lose their essential survival signal. Any p75NTR engagement (if present) would bias further toward apoptosis in the absence of Trk signaling. Therefore, their survival decreases relative to wild-type.\n- The subset of cutaneous nociceptors (Population 2) has high p75NTR and negligible Trk expression. In the presence of only pro-NT-3, p75NTR is robustly activated without counterbalancing Trk signaling, which promotes apoptosis. Therefore, their survival also decreases relative to wild-type.\n\nThus, both populations exhibit decreased survival compared to normal mice, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353347"}, {"introduction": "To truly grasp how neurotrophins work, we must move from qualitative descriptions to quantitative analysis. The terms \"high-affinity\" and \"low-affinity\" receptors are not just labels; they correspond to precise biophysical properties. This problem [@problem_id:2353399] introduces the equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_d$) as the key parameter that governs the strength of a ligand-receptor interaction. By calculating the fractional occupancy of different receptors at a physiological neurotrophin concentration, you will gain a concrete understanding of how a cell can interpret and prioritize signals based on fundamental chemical principles.", "problem": "In the developing nervous system, the survival and differentiation of neurons are critically dependent on a class of signaling molecules known as neurotrophins. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is a canonical member of this family, exerting its effects by binding to two distinct types of cell-surface receptors: the high-affinity Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and the low-affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). The differential activation of these receptors can lead to vastly different cellular outcomes, from survival and growth to apoptosis.\n\nThe strength of the interaction between NGF and its receptors is quantified by the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. A lower $K_d$ value signifies a higher binding affinity. For the NGF-TrkA interaction, the dissociation constant is approximately $K_{d, \\text{TrkA}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-11}$ M. For the NGF-p75NTR interaction, the dissociation constant is approximately $K_{d, \\text{p75NTR}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ M.\n\nConsider a neuron expressing both TrkA and p75NTR receptors that is exposed to a physiological concentration of NGF, $[L] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ M. Assuming the system is at equilibrium and that the binding at one receptor type does not influence binding at the other, calculate the fractional occupancy for both TrkA and p75NTR receptors.\n\nProvide your answer as a pair of decimal values: the first value being the fractional occupancy of TrkA, and the second being the fractional occupancy of p75NTR. Round both values to three significant figures.", "solution": "At equilibrium for a single ligand-receptor binding site, with reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$ and equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, the total receptor concentration is $[R]_{T} = [R] + [RL]$.
