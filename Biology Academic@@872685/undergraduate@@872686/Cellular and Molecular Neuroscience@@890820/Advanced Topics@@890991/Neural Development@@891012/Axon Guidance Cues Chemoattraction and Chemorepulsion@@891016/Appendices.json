{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the most direct ways to determine if a molecule influences axon growth is to present the growth cone with a choice. The stripe assay is a classic in vitro technique designed for this purpose, creating a patterned environment to observe an axon's preferences. This problem [@problem_id:2327811] asks you to interpret the results of such an experiment to classify an unknown molecule based on the clear avoidance behavior of growing axons.", "problem": "In an in vitro experiment to study axon pathfinding, a researcher prepares a culture substrate. The substrate is coated with alternating, parallel stripes. The first set of stripes (Stripe A) is coated exclusively with laminin, a protein known to be a permissive substrate for axonal growth. The second set of stripes (Stripe B) is coated with a mixture of laminin and a purified, uncharacterized molecule designated 'Factor Y'.\n\nNeuronal explants from the developing spinal cord are placed on this patterned substrate and allowed to grow for 48 hours. Upon subsequent microscopic examination, it is observed that axons extend readily from the explants and elongate along the laminin-only stripes (Stripe A). When an axon's growth cone encounters a boundary with a stripe containing Factor Y (Stripe B), it consistently retracts and turns away, continuing its growth along Stripe A. Consequently, the regions corresponding to Stripe B are almost entirely devoid of axons.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following best describes the primary function of Factor Y for these axons?\n\nA. Chemoattractant\n\nB. Cell adhesion molecule\n\nC. Neurotrophic factor\n\nD. Chemorepellent", "solution": "The substrate contains alternating parallel stripes: Stripe A with laminin only (a permissive substrate for axon elongation) and Stripe B with laminin plus an unknown Factor Y. The observation is that axons elongate along laminin-only stripes and, upon encountering the boundary with Stripe B, the growth cones retract and turn away, leaving Stripe B devoid of axons.\n\nLogical evaluation of each option:\n- If Factor Y were a chemoattractant (A), growth cones would be biased toward Stripe B, crossing into it or aligning with it. The observed behavior is the opposite (avoidance), so A is inconsistent.\n- If Factor Y were a cell adhesion molecule (B), it would increase adhesivity and typically facilitate or at least permit growth on Stripe B. The near absence of axons on Stripe B argues against enhanced adhesion and instead indicates avoidance; thus B is inconsistent.\n- If Factor Y were a neurotrophic factor (C), it would support neuronal survival and often promote neurite extension. Its presence would be expected to increase, not decrease, growth on Stripe B. The observed retraction and turning away contradicts this, so C is inconsistent.\n- If Factor Y were a repulsive guidance cue (D), contact with or sensing of Factor Y would cause growth cone collapse, retraction, and turning, resulting in axon exclusion from Stripe B. This precisely matches the observation. Although the term “chemorepellent” often implies a diffusible cue, stripe assays commonly detect substrate-bound repulsive guidance signals as well; among the provided options, D best captures the functional interpretation.\n\nTherefore, Factor Y acts primarily as a repulsive guidance cue for these axons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2327811"}, {"introduction": "Chemotaxis is fundamentally about navigating a chemical landscape, but it is the *gradient* of a cue, not merely its presence, that provides directional information. This exercise [@problem_id:2327829] presents a thought experiment involving a perfectly uniform concentration of a chemoattractant. By analyzing this idealized scenario, you can reinforce your understanding of why a concentration gradient, $\\nabla c$, is essential for directed axon guidance.", "problem": "A team of neurobiologists is investigating a newly identified protein, Axonin-7, for its role in guiding developing hippocampal neurons. In preliminary experiments, they established that when Axonin-7 is released from a point source, creating a stable concentration gradient, it acts as a potent chemoattractant, causing neuronal growth cones to turn and grow towards the source.\n\nFor their next experiment, the team prepares a special culture dish. The entire volume of the growth medium within the dish is infused with a high, but perfectly uniform, concentration of Axonin-7. A healthy, isolated hippocampal neuron with an actively extending axon and growth cone is then introduced into the center of this dish.\n\nAssuming Axonin-7 has no other biological effects besides chemoattraction, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the behavior of the axon's growth cone in this environment over the next several hours?\n\nA. The growth cone will grow exceptionally fast in a straight line, but in a randomly chosen direction, due to the high isotropic stimulation.\n\nB. The growth cone will retract completely, as the lack of a gradient is interpreted as a negative or confusing signal.\n\nC. The growth cone's filopodia will actively explore the surroundings, but there will be no net directional advancement of the axon, leading to a stalled or meandering-in-place state.\n\nD. The growth cone will be guided towards the nearest wall of the culture dish, where the concentration is lowest due to boundary effects.\n\nE. The growth cone will initiate a pre-programmed circular growth pattern to systematically scan the environment for a gradient.", "solution": "We are told Axonin-7 functions solely as a chemoattractant: it biases growth cone advance up a concentration gradient. The fundamental principle of chemotaxis is that directional bias depends on the spatial gradient of the chemoattractant, not the absolute concentration. In continuum terms, the drift component of motion is proportional to the gradient, e.g., $\\vec{v}_{\\text{bias}} \\propto \\nabla c$, where $c$ is the attractant concentration field. With a perfectly uniform concentration throughout the dish, we have $\\nabla c = \\vec{0}$ everywhere, so no directional bias can arise from chemoattraction.\n\nGrowth cones generate motility via actin-driven filopodial and lamellipodial dynamics and can advance, retract, and turn in response to local receptor-mediated signaling. In a uniform field, receptor occupancy is uniform across the growth cone, so there is no left-right or front-back difference to steer the growth cone. Under the stated assumption that Axonin-7 has no other biological effects besides chemoattraction, there is no reason to expect retraction or collapse triggered by high uniform concentration; rather, motility will continue without a directional bias. Consequently, the trajectory becomes an unbiased exploratory process (akin to a random walk): while local protrusions and retractions continue, the expected net displacement over time is zero, i.e., $\\langle \\Delta \\vec{x} \\rangle = \\vec{0}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because high isotropic stimulation without a gradient does not produce a directional bias; chemoattraction requires $\\nabla c \\neq \\vec{0}$.\n- B is incorrect because uniform concentration is not specified to be repulsive or toxic, and the assumption forbids other effects.\n- C correctly states that filopodia will explore but there will be no net directional advance, leading to a stalled or meandering-in-place state.\n- D is incorrect because the setup specifies a perfectly uniform concentration in the entire volume; there is no boundary gradient to the wall.\n- E is incorrect; there is no mechanism for a pre-programmed circular path solely to find a gradient under the given assumption.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2327829"}, {"introduction": "Axon guidance decisions are ultimately executed by internal signaling pathways that control the growth cone's cytoskeleton. This final problem [@problem_id:2327796] explores what happens when this internal machinery is uncoupled from external cues by a hypothetical gain-of-function mutation. Considering a constitutively active receptor challenges you to think about how intracellular repellent signaling directly impacts the fundamental process of axonal extension, independent of the environment.", "problem": "In the developing nervous system, the precise wiring of neural circuits is orchestrated by axon guidance molecules. A neuronal growth cone integrates signals from chemoattractants, which promote growth towards a source, and chemorepellents, which cause growth away from a source. Consider a specific scenario involving two guidance cues: \"Guidancin-A\", a chemoattractant secreted by a target tissue, and \"Guidancin-R\", a chemorepellent.\n\nIn a wild-type neuron, the axon successfully navigates along a positive gradient of Guidancin-A to reach its target. This process is modulated by a uniform, low-level background concentration of Guidancin-R in the extracellular environment.\n\nNow, consider a mutant neuron that carries a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the receptor for Guidancin-R. This mutation causes the receptor to be constitutively active, meaning it continuously signals as if it were bound to a high concentration of Guidancin-R, regardless of whether the actual Guidancin-R ligand is present.\n\nIf this mutant neuron is placed in an environment with the same gradient of Guidancin-A but no Guidancin-R ligand, which of the following outcomes most accurately predicts the growth pattern of its axon?\n\nA. The axon will grow towards the target tissue, following the Guidancin-A gradient, but at a much faster rate than the wild-type axon.\n\nB. The axon will grow directly away from the source of Guidancin-A, as the constitutive repulsive signal chemically inverts the attractive signaling pathway.\n\nC. The axon's growth will be severely impaired, leading to stalling or retraction, preventing it from extending significantly in any direction.\n\nD. The axon will extend but wander randomly, unable to detect the Guidancin-A gradient due to internal signal noise.\n\nE. The axon will grow normally towards the target tissue, as the absence of the Guidancin-R ligand means the mutant receptor cannot be activated.", "solution": "We model growth cone guidance as the integration of attractive and repulsive signals across the growth cone. Let $A(\\mathbf{x})$ denote the local concentration of the chemoattractant Guidancin-A with a spatial gradient $\\nabla A(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ pointing toward the target. Let $R(\\mathbf{x})$ denote the extracellular concentration of the chemorepellent Guidancin-R ligand.\n\nPrinciple 1 (signal integration for extension): The net protrusion/extension rate $v$ at a local region of the growth cone can be represented as\n$$\nv = \\alpha A_{\\text{local}} - \\beta R_{\\text{signal}},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha,\\beta>0$ are effective gains for attractive and repulsive pathway outputs, and $R_{\\text{signal}}$ denotes the intracellular repellent signaling activity (which in wild type depends on $R(\\mathbf{x})$ via receptor occupancy).\n\nPrinciple 2 (directional steering): Turning depends on lateral differences across the growth cone. Define the directional decision variable\n$$\nT = \\alpha \\Delta A - \\beta \\Delta R_{\\text{signal}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta A = A_{\\text{front}}-A_{\\text{back}}$ and $\\Delta R_{\\text{signal}} = R_{\\text{signal, front}}-R_{\\text{signal, back}}$. Positive $T$ biases turning up the $A$ gradient; negative $T$ biases turning away.\n\nWild type baseline: In the wild-type environment, $A(\\mathbf{x})$ has a positive gradient, and $R(\\mathbf{x})$ is uniform and low. Thus $\\Delta R_{\\text{signal}} \\approx 0$ and $T \\approx \\alpha \\Delta A > 0$, so the axon steers toward the source. The uniform low repellent reduces $v$ slightly by a constant offset but does not disrupt directional sensing.\n\nMutant condition (constitutively active Guidancin-R receptor): By the problem statement, the receptor signals as if bound to a high concentration of ligand regardless of $R(\\mathbf{x})$. Represent this as a uniform, elevated intracellular repellent signal:\n$$\nR_{\\text{signal}} = R_{0}, \\quad R_{0} \\text{ high and spatially uniform,}\n$$\neven when $R(\\mathbf{x})=0$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta R_{\\text{signal}} = 0,\n$$\nso the directional term remains\n$$\nT = \\alpha \\Delta A > 0,\n$$\nmeaning there is no repellent-derived turning bias away from the attractant; the repellent signal does not invert the attractant gradient because it lacks spatial asymmetry.\n\nHowever, the extension rate is suppressed everywhere:\n$$\nv = \\alpha A_{\\text{local}} - \\beta R_{0}.\n$$\nGiven that $R_{0}$ is described as equivalent to a high ligand concentration, $\\beta R_{0}$ is large. Except perhaps extremely near the peak of $A(\\mathbf{x})$, one expects\n$$\nv \\leq 0 \\quad \\text{(stalling) or} \\quad v  0 \\quad \\text{(retraction)}.\n$$\nBiophysically, constitutive repellent signaling engages pathways (for example, RhoA/ROCK activation and elevated intracellular calcium) that collapse filopodia and lamellipodia, suppress actin polymerization, and prevent microtubule advance, leading to growth cone collapse and failure to extend.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option B is incorrect because a uniform repellent signal cannot produce a directional bias away from the attractant source; it does not invert the attractant gradient.\n- Option D is unlikely because strong uniform repellent signaling suppresses motility rather than causing unbiased random wandering.\n- Option E is incorrect by definition of constitutive activity: signaling occurs without ligand.\n- Option A is the opposite of expected, as repellent signaling reduces rather than increases growth rate.\n\nThe most accurate prediction is severe impairment with stalling or retraction, preventing significant extension, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2327796"}]}
