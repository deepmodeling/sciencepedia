By predicting the effect of disrupting these cellular \"highways,\" you can better appreciate the intricate transport system that underpins synaptic plasticity [@problem_id:2340831].", "problem": "A neurobiologist is studying the cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons. A key process for strengthening synapses, known as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), is dependent on the rapid synthesis of new proteins directly within dendrites, a phenomenon called local protein synthesis. To investigate the transport logistics of this process, the researcher treats the neuronal culture with an experimental drug, Nocodazole, which specifically causes the depolymerization and breakdown of microtubules throughout the neuron. The drug has no direct effect on other cytoskeletal components like actin filaments, nor does it directly inhibit the enzymatic activity of ribosomes or RNA polymerase.\n\nAssuming the treatment is effective immediately, which of the following statements describes the most direct and immediate consequence on the machinery required for initiating new local protein synthesis in the most distal parts of the dendrites?\n\nA. The active transport of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts and ribosomal subunits from the cell body to the distal dendrites will be halted.\n\nB. The process of transcription, creating new mRNA from DNA templates within the nucleus, will cease.\n\nC. Existing ribosomes already located in the distal dendrites will be rapidly degraded and broken down into their constituent parts.\n\nD. The translation of existing mRNA transcripts already present in the distal dendrites will be enhanced to compensate for the disruption.\n\nE. Mitochondria in the distal dendrites will immediately stop producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), preventing ribosomes from functioning.", "solution": "Long-term potentiation requires local protein synthesis in dendrites. Initiation of new local protein synthesis in distal dendrites depends on the availability and delivery of components such as mRNA transcripts, ribosomal subunits, and translation factors. In neurons, long-distance delivery of these cargos from the soma to distal dendrites occurs primarily via active transport along microtubules using motor proteins (anterograde transport by kinesins and retrograde transport by dynein). Actin filaments support local movements and anchoring near synapses but do not substitute for long-range transport from the soma.\n\nNocodazole causes rapid depolymerization of microtubules, removing the tracks required for kinesin- and dynein-based transport. Motor proteins cannot move cargo without intact microtubules, so the immediate and direct effect is the halt of microtubule-dependent active transport of cargos, including mRNA transcripts and ribosomal subunits, from the cell body to distal dendrites.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: it describes the immediate halt of microtubule-dependent active transport of mRNA and ribosomal subunits into distal dendrites.\n- B is incorrect: transcription occurs in the nucleus and does not require microtubules; RNA polymerase activity is not directly affected.\n- C is incorrect: nocodazole does not directly trigger rapid degradation of existing ribosomes in distal dendrites.\n- D is incorrect: there is no mechanism by which microtubule depolymerization would immediately enhance local translation; if anything, reduced supply of components would hinder it.\n- E is incorrect: mitochondrial ATP synthesis is not immediately halted by microtubule depolymerization; although mitochondrial transport is impaired, existing mitochondria continue producing ATP.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is the cessation of active transport of required translational machinery and mRNAs into the distal dendrites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2340831"}, {"introduction": "After establishing how the translational machinery gets to the dendrite, a key question for researchers is how to actually observe and measure local protein synthesis. This practice introduces you to a powerful experimental technique that uses a molecule called puromycin to tag newly made proteins, allowing us to visualize and quantify their production. By analyzing hypothetical data from such an experiment, you will calculate how synaptic stimulation can dramatically increase the rate of local protein synthesis, connecting abstract theory to tangible, measurable results [@problem_id:2340807].", "problem": "A neurobiologist is investigating activity-dependent local protein synthesis in the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons. The experimental method relies on a compound called O-propargyl-puromycin (OP-Puro), a cell-permeable analog of puromycin. When OP-Puro enters a cell, it is incorporated into the C-terminus of newly synthesized, growing polypeptide chains by the ribosome, which leads to the termination of translation. The incorporated OP-Puro molecules can then be covalently linked to a fluorescent dye. The total fluorescence intensity measured from a specific cellular region is thus directly proportional to the total mass of protein synthesized in that region during the labeling period.\n\nThe researcher focuses on a single dendritic segment and performs two experiments. In both experiments, the culture medium is replaced at time $t=0$ with a medium containing OP-Puro and the necessary reagents for fluorescent tagging. The total fluorescence intensity from the dendritic segment is then monitored over time.\n\n1.  **Basal Condition**: The neuron is in a resting state.

After 30.0 minutes, the fluorescence intensity is $I_{basal}(30.0) = 230$ AFU.\n\n2.  **Stimulated Condition**: The experiment is repeated on a similar neuron. At $t=0$ min, a synapse on the observed dendritic segment is potently stimulated with glutamate to induce a form of synaptic plasticity known to depend on local protein synthesis. The initial background fluorescence is also measured to be $I_{stim}(0) = 50$ AFU. After 30.0 minutes, the fluorescence intensity is $I_{stim}(30.0) = 860$ AFU.\n\nAssume that for the duration of the measurement, the rate of new protein synthesis is constant under each condition.
