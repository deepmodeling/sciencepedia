This initial practice [@problem_id:2342190] explores the foundational principle that long-term memory storage is not instantaneous but requires the synthesis of new proteins. By considering an experiment that pharmacologically blocks a key signaling enzyme, you will apply your knowledge of the molecular cascade essential for making memories last.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the molecular basis of long-term memory using a classical fear conditioning paradigm in mice. In this experiment, a mouse learns to associate a neutral auditory cue (a tone) with a mild, unpleasant foot shock. The formation of this long-term memory, a process known as consolidation, is known to depend on the synthesis of new proteins in the amygdala, a brain region critical for fear memories.\n\nIn the experiment, a mouse is placed in a chamber, exposed to the tone-shock pairing, and immediately afterwards receives a direct microinjection into the amygdala of a substance called H-89. H-89 is a specific inhibitor of cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA), a key enzyme in cellular signaling pathways. A separate control group of mice undergoes the exact same conditioning but receives a saline injection instead.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, both the experimental and control mice are returned to the same chamber and the auditory tone is played without the shock. The researcher measures the duration of \"freezing\" behavior, a natural fear response in rodents, as an indicator of memory recall.\n\nBased on the known molecular cascade for long-term memory consolidation, which of the following outcomes is most likely for the mouse that received the H-89 injection compared to the control mouse?\n\nA. The mouse will exhibit a significantly stronger freezing response, indicating that the inhibition of PKA enhances memory consolidation.\n\nB. The mouse will show no significant difference in a freezing response, indicating that PKA is not essential for the consolidation of this type of memory.\n\nC. The mouse will exhibit a significantly reduced freezing response, indicating that the memory of the tone-shock association was not properly consolidated into a long-term form.\n\nD. The mouse will show a normal freezing response, but will be unable to learn new tasks for the next 48 hours, indicating a general disruption of neural plasticity.", "solution": "Classical fear conditioning requires consolidation of the tone-shock association into a long-term memory trace in the amygdala, a process dependent on de novo protein synthesis. A canonical molecular pathway for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation involves the cAMP-PKA-CREB cascade: learning elevates cAMP, which activates PKA; active PKA phosphorylates nuclear targets such as CREB, promoting transcription of immediate early genes and downstream effectors that drive protein synthesis and structural synaptic changes necessary for long-term memory. \n\nH-89 is a selective inhibitor of PKA. Administered into the amygdala immediately after training, it would block PKA activation during the critical post-training consolidation window, thereby preventing CREB-mediated transcription and the protein synthesis required for long-term, but not short-term, memory. Consequently, at a 24-hour test—when performance reflects long-term memory—the mouse receiving H-89 would show impaired recall of the tone-shock association, operationalized as reduced freezing relative to saline-injected controls.\n\nEvaluating options:\n- A is incorrect because inhibiting PKA would not enhance consolidation; it would disrupt it.\n- B is incorrect because PKA is a well-established component of the consolidation machinery for amygdala-dependent fear memories.\n- C is correct: reduced freezing indicates failed consolidation into long-term memory.\n- D is incorrect because the effect is localized to the amygdala microinjection and does not generally prevent new learning across tasks; moreover, normal freezing would not be expected if consolidation in the amygdala was disrupted.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is a significantly reduced freezing response in the H-89 injected mouse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342190"}, {"introduction": "Once a memory is consolidated, is it permanent and unchangeable? This exercise [@problem_id:2342177] challenges that notion by introducing the concept of reconsolidation, where retrieving a memory can temporarily return it to a fragile state. You will analyze a classic experimental design to predict how blocking NMDA receptors after memory reactivation can fundamentally alter an already-established fear memory, demonstrating that memories are dynamic entities.", "problem": "A research team is investigating the molecular mechanisms of memory modification. They conduct a fear conditioning experiment with two groups of rats, Group A and Group B.\n\nOn Day 1, all rats are placed in a specific chamber and are presented with an auditory tone followed by a mild foot shock. This procedure is repeated several times, leading the rats to associate the tone with the shock, a memory indicated by a \"freezing\" response (a state of immobility) upon hearing the tone.\n\nOn Day 7, the rats are returned to the same chamber. They are exposed to the auditory tone alone for a brief period, which elicits a strong freezing response, confirming the memory is intact. Immediately after this reminder session, rats in Group A are given a systemic injection of a saline solution (a control substance), while rats in Group B are given a systemic injection of a potent antagonist for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The NMDA receptor is a glutamate-gated ion channel crucial for certain forms of synaptic plasticity.\n\nOn Day 8, both groups of rats are again placed in the chamber and presented with the auditory tone. Their freezing behavior is measured to assess the strength of the fear memory.\n\nAssuming the NMDA receptor antagonist has no long-term side effects on general behavior or motor function by Day 8, predict the most likely outcome for the freezing behavior of Group B rats when compared to Group A rats on Day 8.\n\nA. The rats in Group B will show significantly enhanced freezing behavior.\n\nB. The rats in Group B will show significantly reduced freezing behavior.\n\nC. The rats in Group B will show the same level of freezing behavior.\n\nD. The rats in Group B will be unable to hear the tone due to auditory system impairment caused by the drug.\n\nE. The rats in Group B will show normal freezing initially, but the memory will fade much faster than in Group A over the subsequent hours.", "solution": "The conditioning on Day 1 creates a long-term associative memory linking the auditory tone (conditioned stimulus) to the foot shock (unconditioned stimulus), operationalized by a freezing response to the tone. On Day 7, presentation of the tone alone reactivates this memory, as evidenced by robust freezing. Memory reactivation induces a transient labile state (destabilization), after which the memory must undergo reconsolidation to persist. Reconsolidation is a form of synaptic plasticity requiring molecular processes that depend on glutamatergic signaling, including activation of the NMDA receptor.\n\nKey principle: NMDA receptor activation is crucial for plasticity processes underlying stabilization of synaptic changes. Upon retrieval, the memory enters a labile state and requires NMDA receptor–dependent processes for restabilization (reconsolidation). Blocking NMDA receptors around the reconsolidation window disrupts these plasticity mechanisms, leading to a weakening of the reactivated memory trace.\n\nIn this experiment, immediately after the reminder session on Day 7, Group A receives saline (control), so reconsolidation proceeds normally, preserving the fear memory. Group B receives a systemic NMDA receptor antagonist immediately after retrieval. Given the timing, the retrieval has already occurred, so initial expression of the memory on Day 7 is unaffected. However, the antagonist interferes with NMDA receptor–dependent processes required for reconsolidation following retrieval. Assuming no lingering non-specific behavioral or motor effects by Day 8, the expected specific effect is a weakened reactivated memory in Group B.\n\nTherefore, on Day 8, when both groups are tested with the tone, Group B should show a significantly reduced freezing response relative to Group A due to impaired reconsolidation of the fear memory. This rules out enhancement (A), no change (C), sensory impairment (D), and transient within-session decay (E), given the stated assumptions and the known role of NMDA receptors in reconsolidation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2342177"}, {"introduction": "Memory reconsolidation is not an all-or-nothing process; it has specific boundary conditions that determine whether a retrieved memory becomes labile. This advanced problem [@problem_id:2342165] delves into the molecular thresholds that govern memory destabilization. By comparing the effects of long versus very brief memory retrieval, you will reason about the specific cellular mechanisms, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, that must be engaged to open the window for memory modification.", "problem": "In a classic fear conditioning experiment, a rodent is placed in a specific context (Context A) and receives a mild foot shock. The animal subsequently forms a stable, long-term memory associating Context A with the aversive stimulus, exhibiting a freezing response upon re-exposure to the context. This memory undergoes consolidation and is stable for weeks.\n\nTo investigate the boundary conditions for memory reconsolidation, two groups of animals are tested two weeks after the initial conditioning.\n- **Group 1:** Animals are re-exposed to Context A for 60 seconds. Immediately following this re-exposure, they are administered a systemic injection of anisomycin, a potent protein synthesis inhibitor.\n- **Group 2:** Animals are re-exposed to Context A for a very brief period of 2 seconds. Immediately following this brief re-exposure, they are also administered a systemic injection of anisomycin.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, both groups are tested again in Context A. The results show that animals in Group 1 exhibit a significant reduction in freezing, indicating amnesia for the fear memory. In contrast, animals in Group 2 exhibit robust freezing, identical to control animals that received no anisomycin, indicating their fear memory remained intact.\n\nBoth brief and long re-exposures are sufficient to trigger the retrieval of the memory, as evidenced by initial freezing behavior. However, only the long re-exposure renders the memory susceptible to disruption by a protein synthesis inhibitor. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct molecular explanation for why the fear memory in Group 2 did not become labile and was thus immune to the effects of anisomycin?\n\nA. The 2-second re-exposure was too short to trigger the release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft, preventing the activation of postsynaptic N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and subsequent memory reactivation.\n\nB. The 2-second re-exposure generated a transient calcium influx that was sufficient for memory retrieval but fell below the necessary threshold to activate the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) required to degrade key synaptic scaffolding proteins and destabilize the memory trace.\n\nC. The 2-second re-exposure led to the rapid and preferential transcription of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which actively protects existing synaptic proteins from degradation, thereby preventing the memory from entering a labile state.\n\nD. The 2-second re-exposure failed to induce the necessary epigenetic modifications, such as histone acetylation, that are required to make the memory trace accessible for transcription-dependent destabilization processes.\n\nE. The 2-second re-exposure induced the immediate restabilization of the memory trace by activating protein phosphatases, which dephosphorylated synaptic proteins so quickly that the window for lability was bypassed entirely.", "solution": "The key sequence of events in reconsolidation is: (i) a consolidated memory is retrieved, (ii) retrieval under appropriate boundary conditions induces destabilization (labilization), which is an active, protein degradation–dependent process, and (iii) the now-labile memory requires new protein synthesis to restabilize. A protein synthesis inhibitor such as anisomycin produces amnesia only if step (ii) has occurred; otherwise, if destabilization does not occur, the memory remains in its consolidated state and does not depend on new protein synthesis, rendering anisomycin ineffective.\n\nEmpirically and mechanistically, memory destabilization requires specific molecular triggers that go beyond mere retrieval, including activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, calcium entry, and critically, engagement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) that degrades synaptic scaffolding proteins and facilitates processes such as AMPA receptor endocytosis. Pharmacological blockade of the proteasome prevents destabilization and thereby protects against anisomycin-induced amnesia, establishing that UPS activation is necessary for labilization.\n\nIn the present experiment, both the 2-second and 60-second re-exposures retrieve the memory, as indicated by freezing at the time of re-exposure. However, only the 60-second re-exposure produced anisomycin-sensitive amnesia 24 hours later, demonstrating that only the longer re-exposure induced destabilization. The most direct molecular explanation is that the brief (2-second) re-exposure produced a calcium signal sufficient for retrieval but insufficient in magnitude and/or duration to exceed the threshold needed to activate the UPS and associated degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins. Without UPS engagement, the memory trace is not destabilized; therefore, anisomycin has no target process to disrupt, and the memory remains intact.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A is incorrect because retrieval occurred, which implies glutamate release and postsynaptic receptor activation; a complete failure to activate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors is inconsistent with observed retrieval.\n- Option B correctly identifies a thresholded requirement for UPS activation via calcium-dependent signaling, consistent with evidence that proteasome-mediated degradation is necessary for destabilization and that short re-exposure can fail to meet this requirement.\n- Option C is implausible because a 2-second re-exposure is insufficient to drive preferential transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and, moreover, brain-derived neurotrophic factor often facilitates plasticity underlying reconsolidation rather than preventing destabilization by protecting proteins.\n- Option D is incorrect because destabilization per se is primarily proteasome-dependent and does not require immediate epigenetic modifications or transcription to render the memory labile; epigenetic mechanisms are more relevant to subsequent restabilization.\n- Option E is inconsistent with the known role of phosphatases (such as calcineurin) in facilitating, not prematurely terminating, the destabilization processes (for example, by promoting AMPA receptor endocytosis), and it does not account for the necessity of a protein synthesis window for restabilization.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct molecular explanation is that the 2-second re-exposure failed to reach the calcium-dependent threshold needed to activate the UPS and degrade key synaptic scaffolding proteins, leaving the memory non-labile and resistant to anisomycin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2342165"}]}
