This exercise explores such a hypothetical scenario, involving a photoreceptor cell with a constitutively active phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme. By determining the state of this mutant cell in darkness, you will reinforce your understanding of the direct link between PDE activity, cGMP levels, and the membrane hyperpolarization that constitutes the neural signal for light [@problem_id:2344000].", "problem": "In the vertebrate retina, photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) do not fire action potentials but instead respond to light with a graded change in their membrane potential. In complete darkness, a photoreceptor cell is relatively depolarized due to an inward flow of cations (primarily $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$) through channels that are kept open by the presence of a second messenger molecule, cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP). This steady inward current is known as the \"dark current\". The absorption of a photon initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the activation of an enzyme called phosphodiesterase (PDE).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a genetic mutation causes the PDE enzyme within a rod cell to be constitutively active. This means the enzyme is permanently \"on\" and operates at its maximum catalytic rate, regardless of the presence or absence of light. Which of the following statements best describes the state of this mutant rod cell when placed in complete darkness?\n\nA. The rod cell will be permanently hyperpolarized.\n\nB. The rod cell will be permanently depolarized.\n\nC. The rod cell will exhibit a normal dark membrane potential, but it will be unable to respond to light.\n\nD. The rod cell will function normally, but its sensitivity to light will be significantly enhanced.\n\nE. The rod cell's membrane potential will fluctuate randomly and be unstable.", "solution": "In darkness, rod photoreceptors maintain a depolarized membrane potential because cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channels in the outer segment are held open by cytosolic cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This permits a steady inward “dark current” carried mainly by $ \\text{Na}^{+} $ and $ \\text{Ca}^{2+} $, keeping $V_{m}$ relatively depolarized.\n\nPhosphodiesterase (PDE) hydrolyzes cGMP to GMP, thereby lowering $[ \\text{cGMP} ]$ and closing CNG channels. Under normal phototransduction, light activates PDE via transducin, decreasing $[ \\text{cGMP} ]$, closing CNG channels, reducing inward cation current, and hyperpolarizing the membrane toward the $ \\text{K}^{+} $ equilibrium potential.\n\nLet $[G] \\equiv [ \\text{cGMP} ]$. The cGMP balance can be represented symbolically as\n$$\n\\frac{d[G]}{dt} = S - v_{\\text{PDE}} ,\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the synthesis rate by guanylyl cyclase and $v_{\\text{PDE}}$ is the hydrolysis rate by PDE.

The CNG channel open probability can be modeled by a Hill relation,\n$$\nP_{\\text{open}} = \\frac{[G]^{n}}{K_{1/2}^{n} + [G]^{n}} ,\n$$\nso that as $[G] \\to 0$, one has $P_{\\text{open}} \\to 0$.

With the inward dark current removed, the remaining outward $ \\text{K}^{+} $ conductances dominate, driving $V_{m}$ toward $E_{K}$, which is more negative than the normal dark potential. Thus the membrane becomes hyperpolarized, mimicking the light state.\n\nBecause PDE is permanently active, this hyperpolarized state persists in complete darkness; the cell is effectively “locked” in the light-adapted, hyperpolarized condition. Therefore, the best description is that the rod cell will be permanently hyperpolarized.\n\nThis corresponds to option A, whereas:\n- B is incorrect because depolarization requires open CNG channels and sustained inward cation current, which are lost when $[G]$ is low.\n- C is incorrect because the dark membrane potential is not normal; it is shifted to a hyperpolarized state.\n- D is incorrect because constitutive PDE activity reduces, not enhances, sensitivity; the cell is saturated in the light-like state.\n- E is incorrect because the constitutive biochemical drive stabilizes, rather than destabilizes, the membrane potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2344000"}, {"introduction": "The ability to perceive motion and rapid visual changes depends not only on how quickly a light signal is initiated, but also on how quickly it is terminated. This practice focuses on the crucial role of signal termination, specifically the quenching of activated rhodopsin by the protein arrestin. By calculating the difference in response duration between a normal cell and a hypothetical mutant unable to perform this quenching step, you can quantitatively appreciate why rapid inactivation is essential for the temporal fidelity of our vision [@problem_id:2344007].", "problem": "The visual phototransduction cascade in vertebrate retinal rod cells is a classic example of a G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway. In this cascade, light absorption by a rhodopsin molecule (R) activates it to a state R*. This activated state, R*, catalyzes the activation of a G-protein called transducin. To ensure high temporal fidelity of vision, this signal must be rapidly shut off. A crucial step in this signal termination is the phosphorylation of R* by rhodopsin kinase, followed by the binding of a protein called arrestin. Arrestin binding sterically hinders R* from activating any more transducin molecules, effectively quenching the signal at its source.\n\nConsider a simplified kinetic model for the light response triggered by a single photon. Assume the duration of the cellular hyperpolarization response is directly proportional to the total number of transducin molecules activated following the absorption of one photon. The total number of activated transducin molecules is, in turn, the product of the constant activation rate, $\\nu$, and the average lifetime of the active R* state, $\\tau_{\\text{active}}$.\n\nIn a normal, wild-type rod cell, the combined processes of phosphorylation and arrestin binding lead to a rapid quenching of the R* state, with a characteristic average lifetime of $\\tau_{\\text{WT}} = 50.0 \\ \\text{ms}$.\n\nNow, consider a mutant rod cell in which a genetic modification prevents arrestin from binding to phosphorylated R*.

It presents a thought experiment where the native G-protein, transducin ($G_t$), is replaced with $G_s$, a G-protein that normally activates a different second messenger pathway. Predicting the outcome of this molecular swap will test your understanding of the specificity of signaling components and demonstrate how changing a single protein can fundamentally alter—and in this case, even reverse—the cell's physiological response to a stimulus [@problem_id:2343978].", "problem": "In a typical vertebrate rod photoreceptor, the absorption of a photon by rhodopsin triggers a G-protein signaling cascade that leads to cellular hyperpolarization. This process involves the activation of the G-protein transducin ($G_t$), whose alpha subunit ($G_{\\alpha t}$) subsequently activates a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase (PDE). The resulting decrease in cGMP concentration closes cGMP-gated cation channels, reducing the inward \"dark current\" and hyperpolarizing the cell.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a rod cell is genetically engineered. In this cell, the native transducin ($G_t$) is entirely replaced by the stimulatory G-protein ($G_s$), which is normally involved in other signaling pathways. The alpha subunit of $G_s$ ($G_{\\alpha s}$) is known to be a potent activator of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (AC), which synthesizes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, make the following two assumptions:\n1. The light-activated form of rhodopsin is capable of binding to and catalytically activating the foreign $G_s$ protein with an efficiency similar to its activation of native $G_t$.\n2. The cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels in the rod's outer segment, while maximally sensitive to cGMP, can also be opened by the binding of cAMP.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the predicted immediate response of the membrane potential of this engineered rod cell when it is exposed to a flash of light, starting from a dark-adapted state?\n\nA.

The cell will first hyperpolarize briefly, then strongly depolarize to a potential more positive than its dark resting potential.\n\nE. The cell's membrane potential will begin to oscillate.", "solution": "In a normal rod, a photon activates rhodopsin (R*), which activates $G_{t}$; $G_{\\alpha t}$ then activates PDE, lowering $[\\text{cGMP}]$. Because cyclic nucleotide-gated channels are opened by cyclic nucleotide binding, the open probability $P_{\\text{open}}$ decreases as $[\\text{cGMP}]$ falls, channel conductance decreases, the inward dark current declines, and the membrane hyperpolarizes.\n\nThis sequence can be formalized by the ligand-gated open probability relation (e.g., a Hill form):\n$$\nP_{\\text{open}}=\\frac{[\\text{cGMP}]^{n}}{K^{n}+[\\text{cGMP}]^{n}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad g_{\\text{CNG}}=\\bar{g}_{\\text{CNG}}\\,P_{\\text{open}}.\n$$\nThe CNG current is\n$$\nI_{\\text{CNG}}=g_{\\text{CNG}}\\,(V_{m}-E_{\\text{CNG}}),\n$$\nwith $E_{\\text{CNG}}$ depolarized relative to the dark $V_{m}$, so reducing $g_{\\text{CNG}}$ drives $V_{m}$ more negative (hyperpolarization).\n\nIn the engineered rod, $G_{t}$ is replaced by $G_{s}$. By assumption 1, R* efficiently activates $G_{s}$, and $G_{\\alpha s}$ activates adenylyl cyclase (AC), increasing $[\\text{cAMP}]$. There is no activation of the rod PDE by $G_{\\alpha s}$, so there is no immediate light-triggered decrease in $[\\text{cGMP}]$; to first order, $[\\text{cGMP}]$ remains at its dark-adapted value on the immediate timescale considered.\n\nBy assumption 2, the CNG channels can also be opened by cAMP. A convenient way to capture this is to write the effective agonist drive as\n$$\n[\\text{L}]_{\\text{eff}}=[\\text{cGMP}]+\\alpha[\\text{cAMP}], \\quad 0<\\alpha<1,\n$$\nwith open probability\n$$\nP_{\\text{open}}=\\frac{[\\text{L}]_{\\text{eff}}^{n}}{K^{n}+[\\text{L}]_{\\text{eff}}^{n}}.\n$$\nThus, when light increases $[\\text{cAMP}]$ via $G_{s}\\to\\text{AC}$, $P_{\\text{open}}$ increases because $\\frac{\\partial P_{\\text{open}}}{\\partial[\\text{cAMP}]}>0$ given fixed $[\\text{cGMP}]$.

Because PDE is not activated, there is no initial mechanism to lower $[\\text{cGMP}]$ and close channels; hence no initial hyperpolarization is expected.\n\nTherefore, the immediate response of the engineered rod to a light flash from darkness is a depolarization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2343978"}]}
