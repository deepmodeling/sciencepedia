This practice exercise simulates a common genotyping method, Western blotting, which allows scientists to visualize proteins based on their size. By analyzing the size and presence of a target protein, you can deduce whether an animal is wild-type, heterozygous, or a homozygous knockout, as demonstrated in this problem [@problem_id:2354488].", "problem": "Researchers are investigating a hypothetical protein called \"NeuroStabilin\" (NS), which is believed to play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of synapses. In its normal, wild-type form, the NS protein has a molecular weight of 50 kDa. To study its function, a knockout mouse model was created. In this model, the gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which has a molecular weight of 27 kDa, was inserted into the middle of the *NeuroStabilin* gene. This insertion disrupts the function of the NS protein and creates a new, non-functional NS-GFP fusion protein.\n\nA neuroscientist prepares brain tissue lysates from three different mice: Mouse A, Mouse B, and Mouse C. These lysates are subjected to Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to separate the proteins by size, followed by a Western blot analysis. The blot is probed with a specific antibody that recognizes the C-terminal region of the NeuroStabilin protein. This C-terminal region is encoded by a part of the gene that remains intact and is expressed in both the wild-type protein and the NS-GFP fusion protein. The results of the Western blot are described as follows:\n\n-   The lane corresponding to **Mouse A** shows a single, distinct band at 50 kDa.\n-   The lane corresponding to **Mouse B** shows a single, distinct band at 77 kDa.\n-   The lane corresponding to **Mouse C** shows two distinct bands: one at 50 kDa and another at 77 kDa.\n\nUsing the standard notation where `+/+` represents a wild-type genotype, `+/-` represents a heterozygous genotype, and `-/-` represents a homozygous knockout genotype, determine the genotype for each of the three mice.\n\nA.

Your task is to predict the ISH results in a knockout animal, reinforcing the fundamental principle that deleting a gene prevents its transcription into mRNA.", "problem": "A team of neuroscientists is investigating a neuropeptide called \"Vigilance-Associated Peptide\" (VAP), which they hypothesize is involved in regulating states of wakefulness. Based on prior research, VAP is exclusively synthesized in a small cluster of neurons within the locus coeruleus. To test their hypothesis, the scientists utilize two distinct mouse models: a standard wild-type (WT) mouse line and a genetically engineered knockout (KO) mouse line. The KO mice have been generated such that the entire gene sequence coding for VAP has been permanently deleted from their genome.\n\nThe researchers perform a technique called in-situ hybridization (ISH) on brain tissue sections containing the locus coeruleus from both WT and KO animals. The ISH protocol uses a labeled nucleic acid probe that is designed to specifically bind to the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of the VAP gene. A positive signal, indicating the presence of VAP mRNA, is visualized as a distinct dark precipitate within the cells.\n\nBased on the principles of molecular biology and the nature of these animal models, what is the expected outcome of this ISH experiment?\n\nA. A strong positive signal will be observed in the locus coeruleus of WT mice, and a signal of identical intensity will be observed in the locus coeruleus of KO mice, because the probe detects the neurons that are supposed to make VAP, regardless of genetic status.\n\nB. No signal will be observed in the locus coeruleus of either WT or KO mice, because the neuropeptide is a protein, and ISH is a technique for detecting DNA.\n\nC.

By the central dogma, transcription requires a genomic DNA template for the gene of interest.

The scientist works with two groups of mice: a wild-type group and a genetically engineered \"knockout\" (KO) group. In the KO mice, the gene encoding the $\\beta_1$ subunit of the VGSC has been deleted. Previous research has established that the primary role of the $\\beta_1$ subunit is to accelerate the transition of the channel from the open state to the inactivated state, without significantly affecting the voltage-dependence of activation or the single-channel conductance.\n\nThe scientist isolates a neuron from a wild-type mouse and another from a KO mouse. Both neurons are subjected to an identical suprathreshold depolarizing current injection to elicit a single action potential, which is recorded using an intracellular electrode. Based on the known function of the $\\beta_1$ subunit, which of the following describes the most prominent difference that would be observed in the action potential recorded from the KO neuron compared to the wild-type neuron?\n\nA.

Their kinetics follow first-order dynamics of the form\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\alpha_{m}(V)\\left(1 - m\\right) - \\beta_{m}(V) m,\\quad\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\alpha_{h}(V)\\left(1 - h\\right) - \\beta_{h}(V) h,\n$$\nwith corresponding time constants $\\tau_{m}(V)$ and $\\tau_{h}(V)$. The experimental premise states that the $\\beta_1$ subunit is to accelerate the transition of the channel from the open state to the inactivated state, without significantly affecting the voltage-dependence of activation or the single-channel conductance. In a Markov description $C \\rightleftarrows O \\rightleftarrows I$, this means the $O \\to I$ rate $k_{OI}$ is increased by $\\beta_1$; equivalently, in the Hodgkin–Huxley reduction, the inactivation time constant $\\tau_{h}(V)$ is reduced by $\\beta_1$. Therefore, in the knockout lacking $\\beta_1$, $k_{OI}$ is reduced and $\\tau_{h}(V)$ is increased, so $h$ decays more slowly during depolarization.\n\nThe membrane voltage dynamics obey\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\left(I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right) + I_{\\mathrm{inj}}.\n$$\nDuring the rising phase, a suprathreshold depolarization rapidly increases $m$ (since $\\tau_{m}(V)$ is small at depolarized $V$), opening sodium channels and producing a large inward $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. Because the premise specifies that the $\\beta_1$ subunit does not significantly affect activation voltage-dependence or single-channel conductance, and does not primarily regulate $m$-gating kinetics, the slope of the rising phase is not expected to be significantly slower in the knockout; thus $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ onset remains rapid, and the threshold is not significantly shifted.\n\nDuring the falling phase, repolarization results from two coordinated processes: sodium channel inactivation (decrease of $h$, reducing inward $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$) and activation of delayed-rectifier potassium channels (increasing outward $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$). If $\\beta_1$ is absent, $h$ remains larger for longer because $\\tau_{h}(V)$ is increased; hence $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ remains more inward for longer:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}}^{\\mathrm{KO}}(t) = g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3}(t) h_{\\mathrm{KO}}(t)\\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right),\n\\quad h_{\\mathrm{KO}}(t) > h_{\\mathrm{WT}}(t)\\ \\text{for the same }V(t),\n$$\nso the net current $-\\left(I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right)$ is less outward (or more inward) during repolarization. Consequently, for the same $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$ kinetics, $dV/dt$ is less negative in magnitude, producing a slower repolarization and a prolonged action potential duration.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is incorrect because resting potential is set mainly by leak and potassium conductances and is not governed by sodium channel inactivation kinetics.\nB is unlikely because the rising phase depends on activation $m$ and conductance amplitude, which are stated to be unaffected.\nC is correct because slower inactivation sustains inward sodium current that opposes repolarization, prolonging the falling phase and broadening the action potential.\nD is unlikely because activation voltage-dependence and threshold are not significantly altered.\nE is incorrect because the sodium channels still activate; only inactivation kinetics are slowed, so action potentials can still be generated.\n\nTherefore, the most prominent difference is a significantly prolonged falling phase (repolarization) in the knockout neuron.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2354420"}]}
