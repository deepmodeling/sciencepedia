The experimental technique being used is indirect Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The protocol involves using a primary antibody that specifically binds to NeuroFelin-1. This primary antibody was produced by immunizing a rabbit with the purified NeuroFelin-1 protein. After incubation with the primary antibody, the tissue slice is treated with a secondary antibody. The researcher mistakenly uses a commercially available secondary antibody labeled \"goat anti-mouse Immunoglobulin G (IgG),\" which is conjugated to a green fluorescent protein. Despite the primary antibody having high affinity for NeuroFelin-1, the researcher observes no specific fluorescent signal in the hippocampus.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for the failure of this experiment?\n\nA. The secondary antibody is designed to bind specifically to the constant region of antibodies produced in mice, not those produced in rabbits.\n\nB. The \"goat anti-mouse IgG\" secondary antibody will bind to the endogenous mouse IgG naturally present in the brain tissue, preventing it from binding to the primary antibody.\n\nC. The primary antibody, having been raised in a rabbit, cannot effectively bind to the NeuroFelin-1 protein which is expressed in a mouse, due to inter-species incompatibility.\n\nD. The goat-derived secondary antibody and the rabbit-derived primary antibody are immunologically incompatible, causing them to precipitate out of the solution before they can bind to the tissue.\n\nE. The green fluorescent protein on the secondary antibody is quenched by components of the mouse brain tissue, preventing signal detection.", "solution": "In indirect immunohistochemistry, the detection strategy requires two sequential bindings:\n1) A primary antibody raised in a given host species binds the target antigen in the tissue via its antigen-binding (Fab) region.\n2) A secondary antibody, raised in another species and generated to recognize the constant (Fc) region of the primary antibody’s IgG, binds specifically to the host species of the primary antibody.\n\nTherefore, the necessary matching rule is: the secondary antibody must be anti-(host species of primary) IgG. Concretely, for a primary antibody “rabbit anti–NeuroFelin-1,” the correct secondary must be “anti-rabbit IgG,” not anti-mouse IgG.\n\nIn the described experiment, the primary antibody is produced in rabbit (rabbit anti–NeuroFelin-1). The secondary used is “goat anti-mouse IgG.” By design, “goat anti-mouse IgG” recognizes epitopes on the Fc (constant) region of mouse IgG, not rabbit IgG. Because the rabbit primary antibody’s Fc region lacks the mouse-specific epitopes, the secondary cannot bind the primary. Without secondary binding, no fluorescent label is recruited to the primary antibody bound to NeuroFelin-1, producing no specific fluorescent signal.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states the species-specific Fc recognition mismatch: the secondary is specific for mouse IgG Fc, not rabbit IgG Fc. This directly explains the absence of signal.\n- B suggests binding to endogenous mouse IgG in tissue. Even if some endogenous IgG exists, this does not explain the failure to detect the primary; the dominant issue is that the secondary cannot bind the rabbit primary at all.\n- C is incorrect: rabbit antibodies commonly bind mouse proteins in IHC if raised against the mouse antigen; there is no intrinsic inter-species incompatibility preventing antigen recognition.\n- D is incorrect: there is no general “goat–rabbit” incompatibility causing precipitation under standard IHC conditions; moreover, the secondary would need to recognize rabbit IgG to form immune complexes, which it does not.\n- E is unlikely and not the most direct explanation. Fluorophore quenching would not selectively eliminate signal only from the primary; the primary issue here is the species mismatch between primary and secondary.\n\nThus, the most accurate and direct explanation is the species-mismatch of the secondary antibody with the primary antibody’s Fc region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2338967"}, {"introduction": "In molecular neuroscience, comparing protein and mRNA localization provides a more complete picture of gene expression. But what happens when immunohistochemistry (IHC) for a protein works perfectly, while in situ hybridization (ISH) for its corresponding mRNA fails completely? This problem [@problem_id:2338926] challenges you to diagnose such a discrepancy, pushing you to consider the distinct biochemical vulnerabilities of proteins versus RNA molecules.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the expression of a newly discovered protein, which they have named \"Synaptic Plasticity Factor\" (SPF), in the hippocampus. To do this, they prepare a series of coronal brain slices from a single adult mouse. They then perform two parallel experiments on adjacent slices.\n\nExperiment 1: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect the SPF protein. This procedure involves using a primary antibody specific to the SPF protein, followed by a secondary antibody system that generates a stable, visible brown precipitate where the protein is located.\n\nExperiment 2: In situ hybridization (ISH) to detect the messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes for the SPF protein. This procedure involves using a custom-synthesized antisense riboprobe labeled with digoxigenin (DIG). After the probe hybridizes to the target SPF mRNA in the tissue, an anti-DIG antibody conjugated to an enzyme is applied, which also generates a stable, visible precipitate.\n\nBased on previous quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) data, the SPF gene is known to be highly expressed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The results of the experiments are as follows: The IHC experiment yields a strong, clear signal specifically localized to the neurons in the CA1 region, confirming the presence and location of the SPF protein. However, the ISH experiment shows a complete absence of signal across the entire tissue slice.\n\nAssuming the researcher correctly followed the protocol for both experiments and the antisense riboprobe sequence is correct, which of the following choices offers the most probable explanation for the discrepancy in the results?\n\nA. The hybridization buffer used for the ISH was contaminated with a broad-spectrum protease.\n\nB. One or more of the aqueous solutions used during the ISH procedure were contaminated with Ribonuclease (RNase).\n\nC. The tissue was not adequately permeabilized with proteinase K before the hybridization step in the ISH protocol.\n\nD. The secondary antibody used in the IHC protocol was non-specific, leading to a false positive signal.\n\nE. The primary antibody used for the IHC had a much higher affinity for its target than the riboprobe used for the ISH.", "solution": "We are given adjacent tissue slices from one mouse hippocampus. Experiment 1 (IHC) detects SPF protein and shows a strong, specific CA1 neuronal signal. Experiment 2 (ISH) is intended to detect SPF mRNA using a DIG-labeled antisense riboprobe and enzyme-coupled detection, but yields no signal anywhere, despite prior qPCR indicating high SPF gene expression in CA1.\n\nLogical deductions:\n1) Because qPCR previously showed high SPF mRNA in CA1 and the IHC detects SPF protein in CA1, the biological expectation is that SPF mRNA is present in CA1. Therefore, a complete absence of ISH signal across the slice is most consistent with a technical failure in the ISH, not a true absence of mRNA.\n2) A technical failure that specifically eliminates the RNA target would abolish ISH signal while leaving IHC (protein detection) unaffected. Contamination with RNase in any aqueous solution used during ISH would degrade the tissue mRNA, thereby preventing riboprobe hybridization and producing no signal, even if enzyme detection and antibodies are otherwise functioning. This precisely explains the discrepancy: protein persists and is detectable by IHC, but the mRNA is destroyed before hybridization or detection in ISH.\n3) Evaluate each option:\n- A: Protease in hybridization buffer would degrade proteins, not RNA. ISH target is RNA; protease would not selectively abolish the RNA target. It could, in principle, impair antibody-based detection steps, but a protease present only in the hybridization buffer is unlikely to survive washes and completely eliminate ISH signal across the tissue. Moreover, it does not account for the specific expectation of abundant mRNA.\n- B: RNase contamination would degrade SPF mRNA in the tissue, preventing probe binding and yielding no ISH signal, while leaving protein detectable by IHC. This is the canonical cause of ISH failure with a global loss of signal.\n- C: Insufficient proteinase K permeabilization can reduce probe penetration and thus reduce ISH signal, but it does not typically cause a complete absence across an entire thin section when protocols are followed, and the prompt specifies the researcher correctly followed the protocol. Even with suboptimal permeabilization, some superficial or partial signal is often observed. This is less probable than RNase contamination for a complete absence.\n- D: A non-specific secondary antibody in IHC causing a false positive would more likely produce widespread or off-target staining, not a specific CA1 neuronal pattern. It also conflicts with prior qPCR indicating CA1 expression. Thus, the IHC signal is likely genuine.\n- E: A higher affinity primary antibody than riboprobe does not plausibly explain a complete absence of ISH signal across the slice when mRNA is abundant. Riboprobes typically have high effective affinity through extensive base pairing; affinity differences would reduce sensitivity, not eliminate all signal, especially with high expression.\n\nTherefore, the most probable explanation is RNase contamination during ISH, which destroys the target mRNA and yields no signal, while leaving the IHC result unaffected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338926"}, {"introduction": "Generating a beautiful multi-color fluorescence image is often just the first step; the real discovery lies in quantifying the spatial relationships between labeled molecules. To determine if two proteins, like a pre- and postsynaptic marker, are truly associated at a synapse, we need to move beyond qualitative observation.

The researcher performs dual-label immunofluorescence on a brain slice to visualize presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic densities.

The analysis is focused on a small, three-dimensional region of interest (ROI) that encompasses several putative synapses.\n\nAfter image acquisition and background subtraction, the researcher uses an intensity threshold to identify pixels containing significant fluorescent signal for each protein. The analysis yields the following integrated intensity values, measured in arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU):\n\n- The total integrated intensity of all red pixels (Synapsin I) within the ROI is $I_{red\\_total} = 1.345 \\times 10^{5}$ AFU.\n- The total integrated intensity of all green pixels (Homer1) within the ROI is $I_{green\\_total} = 1.621 \\times 10^{5}$ AFU.\n- The integrated intensity of red pixels that are also positive for the green signal (i.e., pixels where both Synapsin I and Homer1 are present above threshold) is $I_{red\\_overlap} = 9.872 \\times 10^{4}$ AFU.\n- The integrated intensity of green pixels that are also positive for the red signal is $I_{green\\_overlap} = 1.155 \\times 10^{5}$ AFU.\n\nTo quantify the degree of colocalization, the researcher uses the Manders' Overlap Coefficient (MOC).
