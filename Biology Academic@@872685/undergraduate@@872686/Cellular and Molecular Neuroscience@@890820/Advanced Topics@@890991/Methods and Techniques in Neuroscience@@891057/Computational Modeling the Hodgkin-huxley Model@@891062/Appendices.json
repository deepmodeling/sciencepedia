This practice explores the fascinating phenomenon of anodal break excitation, where a neuron paradoxically fires upon release from a hyperpolarizing stimulus [@problem_id:2331665]. By dissecting the states of the sodium inactivation ($h$) and potassium activation ($n$) gates, you will uncover the subtle mechanisms that prime a neuron for firing.", "problem": "In the study of neural excitability, the Hodgkin-Huxley model provides a mathematical description of how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated. The model describes the membrane current as the sum of a capacitive current and currents flowing through voltage-gated ion channels. The sodium current ($I_{Na}$) is governed by a fast activation gate, $m$, and a slower inactivation gate, $h$. The potassium current ($I_K$) is governed by a slow activation gate, $n$. The probability of each gate being in its permissive (open) state is a value between 0 and 1.\n\nConsider a neuron accurately described by the Hodgkin-Huxley model, initially at a stable resting potential. An experimenter injects a sustained, hyperpolarizing current pulse into the neuron. The duration of this pulse is long enough for the gating variables $m$, $h$, and $n$ to approach their new voltage-dependent steady-state values. Immediately upon the termination of this current pulse (an \"anodal break\"), the neuron's membrane potential rapidly returns towards its resting value and fires a single action potential without any further stimulation.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the state of the channel gates at the moment the hyperpolarizing pulse is terminated, leading to this anodal break excitation?\n\nA. The Na+ inactivation gate $h$ has a significantly higher value (is more open), and the K+ activation gate $n$ has a significantly lower value (is more closed) compared to their resting state values. This combination makes the neuron more excitable.\n\nB. The Na+ activation gate $m$ has a significantly higher value, while the inactivation gate $h$ remains near its resting value. The increased $m$ value allows for a rapid influx of Na+ upon termination of the pulse.\n\nC. The K+ activation gate $n$ has a significantly higher value. Upon termination of the pulse, the rapid closing of these K+ channels causes a strong rebound depolarization that triggers the action potential.\n\nD. The Na+ inactivation gate $h$ has a significantly higher value, but the K+ activation gate $n$ is unaffected by hyperpolarization because its time constant is too long. The action potential is caused solely by the removal of Na+ inactivation.\n\nE. Both the Na+ activation gate $m$ and the Na+ inactivation gate $h$ have lower values. The action potential is triggered because the membrane's capacitance stores a \"rebound charge\" during hyperpolarization.", "solution": "In the Hodgkin-Huxley description, the membrane dynamics under an injected current $I_{\\text{ext}}$ satisfy\n$$\nI_{\\text{ext}}=C_{m}\\frac{dV}{dt}+g_{\\text{Na}}\\,m^{3}h\\,(V-E_{\\text{Na}})+g_{\\text{K}}\\,n^{4}\\,(V-E_{\\text{K}})+g_{L}\\,(V-E_{L}).\n$$\nThe gating variables obey first-order kinetics\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\alpha_{x}(V)\\bigl(1-x\\bigr)-\\beta_{x}(V)\\,x=\\frac{x_{\\infty}(V)-x}{\\tau_{x}(V)},\\quad x\\in\\{m,h,n\\}.\n$$\nFor the standard Hodgkin-Huxley rate functions, the steady-state values satisfy the qualitative monotonicities\n$$\n\\frac{d m_{\\infty}}{dV}>0,\\quad \\frac{d h_{\\infty}}{dV}<0,\\quad \\frac{d n_{\\infty}}{dV}>0,\n$$\nand the characteristic time scales near subthreshold satisfy $\\tau_{m}\\ll \\tau_{h},\\tau_{n}$ (i.e., $m$ is fast, $h$ is slower, and $n$ is slow).\n\nA sustained hyperpolarizing pulse holds the voltage at a hyperpolarized level $V_{\\text{hyp}}$ long enough that\n$$\nm\\approx m_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{hyp}}),\\quad h\\approx h_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{hyp}}),\\quad n\\approx n_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{hyp}}).\n$$\nBecause $V_{\\text{hyp}}<V_{\\text{rest}}$ and using the monotonic relationships above, this implies\n$$\nm_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{hyp}})<m_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{rest}}),\\quad h_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{hyp}})>h_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{rest}}),\\quad n_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{hyp}})<n_{\\infty}(V_{\\text{rest}}).\n$$\nThus, just before termination of the pulse, $m$ is reduced, $h$ is elevated (deinactivated sodium channels), and $n$ is reduced (deactivated potassium channels) relative to rest.\n\nAt the instant the hyperpolarizing current is turned off, $t=0^{+}$, the membrane voltage begins to depolarize toward $V_{\\text{rest}}$, but the gates cannot change instantaneously.
