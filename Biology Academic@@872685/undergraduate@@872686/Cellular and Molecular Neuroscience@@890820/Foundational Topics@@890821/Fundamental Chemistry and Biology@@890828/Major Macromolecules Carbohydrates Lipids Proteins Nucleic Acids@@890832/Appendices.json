This practice explores the direct link between molecular structure and function by examining one of the most critical reactions in the central nervous system: the enzymatic conversion of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate into the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. By analyzing their chemical structures, you will pinpoint the precise molecular change that flips the switch on neuronal activity, a foundational concept in neuropharmacology and synaptic physiology. [@problem_id:2341960]", "problem": "In the mammalian central nervous system, a dynamic balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for proper brain function. This balance is largely maintained by the interplay between the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, and the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA). The synthesis of GABA from glutamate is a key regulatory step and is accomplished in a single reaction catalyzed by a protein enzyme.\n\nGlutamate is a standard alpha-amino acid. Its structure consists of a central alpha-carbon atom covalently bonded to an alpha-amino group (-NH2), an alpha-carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a side chain. The side chain for glutamate is an ethyl group terminated by a second carboxyl group, giving it the chemical formula -CH2-CH2-COOH.\n\nGABA, on the other hand, is known chemically as 4-aminobutanoic acid.\n\nGiven these structures, the enzymatic conversion of glutamate to GABA involves which of the following chemical transformations?\n\nA. The removal of the alpha-carboxyl group from glutamate.\n\nB. The removal of the side-chain carboxyl group from glutamate.\n\nC. The deamination of glutamate, which is the removal of its alpha-amino group.\n\nD. An intramolecular isomerization reaction where the alpha-amino group migrates to the terminal carbon of the side chain.\n\nE. The reduction of the alpha-carboxyl group of glutamate to a primary alcohol.", "solution": "Glutamate is an alpha-amino acid with the backbone and side chain represented as $\\mathrm{HOOC-CH(NH_{2})-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-COOH}$. GABA (4-aminobutanoic acid) has the structure $\\mathrm{NH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-COOH}$.\n\nThe enzymatic conversion in the mammalian central nervous system is catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme, and proceeds by decarboxylation at the alpha position. Specifically, the alpha-carboxyl group of glutamate is removed as carbon dioxide:\n$$\n\\mathrm{HOOC-CH(NH_{2})-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-COOH} \\;\\longrightarrow\\; \\mathrm{NH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-COOH} \\;+\\; \\mathrm{CO_{2}}.\n$$\nThis transformation converts the five-carbon alpha-amino acid into the four-carbon primary amine acid, exactly matching 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA). Therefore, the correct chemical transformation is the removal of the alpha-carboxyl group from glutamate.\n\nTo exclude the alternatives:\n- Choice B (removal of the side-chain carboxyl group) would yield $\\mathrm{HOOC-CH(NH_{2})-CH_{2}-CH_{3}}$ (2-aminobutanoic acid), not GABA.\n- Choice C (deamination) would remove the alpha-amino group, generating an alpha-keto acid (e.g., alpha-ketoglutarate), not GABA.\n- Choice D (intramolecular amino migration) is not the mechanism and would not directly produce $\\mathrm{NH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-COOH}$ from glutamate in a single step.\n- Choice E (reduction of the alpha-carboxyl to a primary alcohol) would give $\\mathrm{HO-CH_{2}-CH(NH_{2})-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-COOH}$, not GABA.\n\nHence, the enzymatic step is alpha-decarboxylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2341960"}, {"introduction": "The identity and function of every protein in a neuron are dictated by a genetic blueprint stored in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).

By definition, the mRNA sequence is identical to the coding strand except that thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U), and orientation remains 5' to 3'. Therefore, the corresponding mRNA is 5' - AUG UAU UUA - 3'.

The second codon changes from TAT to TAC on the DNA coding strand, which corresponds to UAU to UAC on mRNA. From the table, UAU and UAC both encode Tyr. Thus, the amino acid is unchanged, so Mutation 1 is a silent mutation.\n\nFor Mutation 2, position 5 (the second base of the second codon) changes from A to G. The second codon changes from TAT to TGT on the DNA coding strand, which corresponds to UAU to UGU on mRNA. UGU is not among the listed stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) and is not one of the Tyr codons (UAU, UAC).

The third codon changes from TTA to TGA on the DNA coding strand, which corresponds to UUA to UGA on mRNA. UGA is a stop codon per the table, so this introduces a premature termination codon.

This problem explores what happens when the cellular machinery for protein synthesis fails within a critical organelle, the mitochondrion, in one of the brain's most energy-hungry cells—the Purkinje neuron. You will integrate your knowledge of nucleic acids, protein synthesis, and bioenergetics to trace the cascading metabolic failure that leads from a mitochondrial DNA deletion to profound neuronal dysfunction. [@problem_id:2341898]", "problem": "A Purkinje neuron in the cerebellum is characterized by its exceptionally large and complex dendritic arbor, and a high, sustained rate of spontaneous firing, making it one of the most metabolically demanding cell types in the central nervous system. Consider a scenario where an individual inherits a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion. This deletion specifically removes a cluster of genes that encode several mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. These tRNAs are required for the translation of the 13 protein-coding genes located on the mtDNA, which themselves encode critical subunits of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and ATP synthase. Assume the neuron is heterozygous for this deletion, meaning it contains a mixed population of wild-type and deleted mtDNA.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary cascade of events that would lead to dysfunction and eventual degeneration of this Purkinje neuron?\n\nA. The deleted tRNA genes will lead to the misfolding of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins during their import, triggering a mitochondrial unfolded protein response and subsequent apoptosis.\n\nB. The neuron will compensate for the defect by dramatically increasing the rate of glycolysis, leading to a state of chronic lactic acidosis but successfully maintaining its membrane potential and firing rate.\n\nC. The absence of specific tRNAs will stall the synthesis of essential ETC protein subunits within the mitochondria, leading to a severe deficit in Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) production, subsequent failure of ion pumps, chronic membrane depolarization, and heightened vulnerability to excitotoxic cell death.\n\nD. The deletion will prevent the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes, halting all protein synthesis within the organelle and causing mitochondria to be degraded by autophagy faster than they can be replaced.\n\nE. The accumulated defective mtDNA will be recognized by cellular DNA damage sensors, which will directly trigger the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway, independent of the cell's energetic state.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the molecular lesion and its direct consequence. The deletion removes mitochondrial tRNA genes. Fundamental principle: mitochondrial translation requires a full set of organelle-encoded tRNAs to decode codons in the 13 mtDNA-encoded transcripts. If specific tRNAs are absent, translation elongation stalls at codons that require those tRNAs, preventing completion of the corresponding polypeptides. Therefore, synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of Complex I, III, IV, and V is impaired.\n\nBecause the ETC complexes and ATP synthase are multi-subunit assemblies composed of both nuclear-encoded and mtDNA-encoded polypeptides, stoichiometric assembly requires all necessary subunits. Absence of the mtDNA-encoded subunits blocks proper assembly and function. Principle: defective assembly decreases electron flux through the ETC and reduces proton pumping across the inner mitochondrial membrane. According to chemiosmotic coupling, the proton motive force is\n$$\n\\Delta p=\\Delta \\psi-\\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[H^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}{[H^{+}]_{\\text{out}}}\\right),\n$$\nand the rate of ATP synthesis by ATP synthase satisfies $J_{\\text{ATP}}\\propto \\Delta p$ for a given enzyme content. Thus, impaired ETC function decreases $\\Delta p$ and lowers $J_{\\text{ATP}}$, producing a severe ATP deficit.\n\nPurkinje neurons have very high ATP demand due to sustained spontaneous firing, maintenance of ion gradients, and synaptic transmission. The Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase consumes ATP to export three Na^{+} and import two K^{+} per cycle, and plasma membrane and intracellular Ca^{2+}-ATPases clear Ca^{2+}. Principle: ion gradients set by ATP-dependent pumps determine equilibrium potentials via the Nernst relation,\n$$\nE_{\\text{ion}}=\\frac{RT}{zF}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{ion}]_{\\text{out}}}{[\\text{ion}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right),\n$$\nand resting membrane potential $V_{m}$ is governed by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz relation, which depends on these gradients. With reduced ATP, pump currents decline, gradients dissipate, and $V_{m}$ depolarizes chronically.\n\nChronic depolarization and impaired Ca^{2+} clearance increase intracellular Ca^{2+} through voltage-gated channels and glutamate receptors, especially during ongoing synaptic activity. Elevated cytosolic Ca^{2+} activates degradative enzymes and, together with reactive oxygen species generated by dysfunctional ETC, drives excitotoxicity and apoptotic/necrotic pathways. Thus, the cascade is: tRNA loss blocks mitochondrial translation of ETC subunits → defective ETC and ATP synthase function → decreased $\\Delta p$ and ATP production → failure of ATP-dependent ion pumps → membrane depolarization and Ca^{2+} overload → excitotoxic cell death.\n\nHeteroplasmy introduces a threshold effect: when the mutant mtDNA fraction exceeds a critical level for a given energy demand, the phenotype manifests. Purkinje neurons’ high energetic load lowers the effective threshold, making them particularly vulnerable.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n- A is incorrect because deletion of mitochondrial tRNAs does not cause misfolding of nuclear-encoded proteins during import; nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are translated on cytosolic ribosomes using cytosolic tRNAs. While a mitochondrial unfolded protein response can be secondary, the stated mechanism is wrong.\n\n- B is incorrect because although glycolysis can increase and lactate may accumulate, glycolysis alone cannot sustain the ATP required to maintain ion gradients and firing in Purkinje neurons; thus membrane potential and firing cannot be maintained.\n\n- C is correct and matches the mechanistic cascade: absent mt-tRNAs stall synthesis of essential mtDNA-encoded ETC subunits, causing severe ATP deficiency, pump failure, depolarization, and excitotoxic vulnerability.\n\n- D is incorrect because mitochondrial ribosome assembly primarily depends on mitochondrial rRNAs; loss of tRNAs does not prevent ribosome assembly per se. Translation would stall, but not due to absent ribosomes, and the claim that autophagic degradation outpaces replacement is not the primary deterministic step.\n\n- E is incorrect because direct p53 activation by recognition of mtDNA deletions, independent of energetic collapse, is not the primary pathway; energy failure and excitotoxicity are dominant mechanisms in neurons.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341898"}]}
