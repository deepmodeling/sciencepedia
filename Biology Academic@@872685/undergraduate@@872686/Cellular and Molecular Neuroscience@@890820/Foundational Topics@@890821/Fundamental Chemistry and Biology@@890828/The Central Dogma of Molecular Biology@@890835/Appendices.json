This practice problem [@problem_id:1526360] explores the profound consequences of mutations that alter this reading frame. By comparing the effects of inserting one nucleotide versus three, you will gain a clear understanding of why frameshift mutations are typically far more disruptive than in-frame insertions or deletions.", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is studying a newly discovered thermophilic bacterium. They have isolated a gene, which they call `pyroZ`, that codes for a key metabolic enzyme. The sequence of the non-template (coding) strand of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) at the beginning of the `pyroZ` gene's coding sequence is:\n\n`5'-ATG GCT CGA TTC GAG...-3'`\n\nThe codon `ATG` serves as the start codon. The following is a partial list of codons from the universal genetic code and the amino acids they specify:\n- `ATG`: Methionine (Met)\n- `GCT`: Alanine (Ala)\n- `CGA`: Arginine (Arg)\n- `TTC`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n- `GAG`: Glutamic acid (Glu)\n- `TGC`: Cysteine (Cys)\n- `TCG`: Serine (Ser)\n- `ATT`: Isoleucine (Ile)\n- `AAA`: Lysine (Lys)\n\nTwo different mutations are independently introduced into the `pyroZ` gene right after the start codon:\n\n- **Mutant A**: A single thymine ('T') nucleotide is inserted immediately after the `ATG` start codon.\n- **Mutant B**: The three-nucleotide sequence 'AAA' is inserted immediately after the `ATG` start codon.\n\nAssuming that transcription and translation proceed from these modified sequences, which of the following statements most accurately compares the likely effects of these two mutations on the polypeptide produced?\n\nA. Both Mutant A and Mutant B will produce proteins that are non-functional and have completely different amino acid sequences after the first amino acid.\n\nB. The three-nucleotide insertion in Mutant B is more detrimental to protein function because it adds a whole amino acid, whereas the single-nucleotide insertion in Mutant A has a minor effect.\n\nC. The single-nucleotide insertion in Mutant A will cause a shift in the translational reading frame, leading to a drastically altered amino acid sequence downstream, which is likely more disruptive than the effect of the three-nucleotide insertion in Mutant B.\n\nD. Both mutations will result in the insertion of a single new amino acid into the polypeptide chain, but the rest of the amino acid sequence will remain identical to the original protein.\n\nE. The single-nucleotide insertion in Mutant A will cause the substitution of a single amino acid at the second position, while the three-nucleotide insertion in Mutant B will cause the insertion of a new amino acid at that position.", "solution": "The coding (non-template) DNA strand matches the mRNA sequence except that RNA uses U instead of T. Translation initiates at the start codon and proceeds in non-overlapping triplets, establishing the reading frame. Insertions or deletions of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three cause a frameshift, altering all downstream codons until a stop codon is encountered; insertions or deletions in multiples of three preserve the reading frame and thus insert or delete whole amino acids with the rest of the sequence unchanged.\n\nOriginal coding-strand sequence at the start of the open reading frame:\n5'-ATG GCT CGA TTC GAG ...-3'\nThis encodes the amino acid sequence:\nMet (ATG), Ala (GCT), Arg (CGA), Phe (TTC), Glu (GAG), ...\n\nMutant A inserts a single T immediately after the start codon ATG. The sequence becomes:\n5'-ATG T GCT CGA TTC GAG ...-3'\nEstablishing the reading frame from the start codon, the triplet parsing is:\nATG | TGC | TCG | ATT | CGA | G...\nThus, after Met, the codons become TGC (Cys), TCG (Ser), ATT (Ile), CGA (Arg), ... This is a one-nucleotide insertion, which shifts the reading frame starting at the second codon. Therefore, the amino acid sequence from the second position onward is extensively altered relative to the original and is likely to encounter a premature stop codon, making this highly disruptive to protein function.\n\nMutant B inserts AAA (three nucleotides) immediately after ATG. The sequence becomes:\n5'-ATG AAA GCT CGA TTC GAG ...-3'\nReading in triplets from the start codon:\nATG | AAA | GCT | CGA | TTC | GAG | ...\nThus, this introduces a Lys (AAA) immediately after Met and preserves the original reading frame thereafter. The downstream sequence (Ala-Arg-Phe-Glu-...) remains unchanged. This in-frame insertion adds a single amino acid without altering the subsequent codons, typically less disruptive than a frameshift.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Mutant A causes a frameshift with a drastically altered downstream sequence, typically more disruptive.\n- Mutant B adds one amino acid but preserves the downstream sequence.\n\nTherefore, the statement that most accurately compares the effects is that the single-nucleotide insertion in Mutant A causes a frameshift that is likely more disruptive than the in-frame three-nucleotide insertion in Mutant B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1526360"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of the central dogma's mechanics allows scientists to develop powerful tools to study and manipulate biological systems.
