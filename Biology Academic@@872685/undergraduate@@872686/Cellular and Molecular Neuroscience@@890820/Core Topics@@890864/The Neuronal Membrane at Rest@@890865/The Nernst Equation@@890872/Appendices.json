Since the membrane is permeable only to $K^{+}$, the efflux of these positive ions leaves behind a net negative charge inside the cell (uncompensated anions) and builds up a net positive charge on the immediate outer surface of the membrane. This separation of charge generates an electrical potential difference across the membrane, making the inside negative relative to the outside. This inside-negative electrical potential creates an electrical force that opposes the further efflux of positively charged $K^{+}$ ions. Equilibrium is reached when this inward electrical force exactly balances the outward chemical driving force.

These pumps, such as the Sodium-Potassium-ATPase (Na+/K+ pump) and the Plasma Membrane Calcium-ATPase (PMCA), are essential for maintaining the concentration gradients of ions across the cell membrane.\n\nIn a healthy neuron at physiological temperature, the typical concentrations are as follows:\n- Sodium ($Na^{+}$): 145 mM outside, 15 mM inside\n- Potassium ($K^{+}$): 5 mM outside, 140 mM inside\n- Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$): 2 mM outside, 100 nM inside (note: 100 nM = $1 \\times 10^{-4}$ mM)\n\nAs the disease progresses and the pumps cease to function, the ions will slowly leak across the membrane through their respective channels until the system reaches a new long-term equilibrium state.
