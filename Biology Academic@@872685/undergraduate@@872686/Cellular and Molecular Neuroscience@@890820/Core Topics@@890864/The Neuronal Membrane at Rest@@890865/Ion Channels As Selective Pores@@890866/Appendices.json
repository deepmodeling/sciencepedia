The lining of the pore is not an inert tube but is composed of specific amino acid residues whose properties dictate ion preference. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2339518] explores how a single, targeted mutation—swapping a neutral amino acid for a negatively charged one—can fundamentally alter the electrostatic environment within the pore, thereby shifting its selectivity from monovalent to divalent cations.", "problem": "A neurobiologist is studying a hypothetical voltage-gated cation channel, named \"CatV1\", which is normally highly selective for potassium ions ($K^{+}$). The selectivity of this channel is determined by a narrow region of the pore known as the selectivity filter. In the wild-type (normal) version of the CatV1 channel, a specific position within the lining of this filter is occupied by a glycine residue. Glycine is the simplest amino acid, with a single hydrogen atom as its side chain, making it small and electrically neutral.\n\nA researcher creates a mutant version of the CatV1 channel by altering its genetic code. In this mutant channel, the glycine residue at the critical position in the selectivity filter is replaced by an aspartate residue. At typical physiological pH, the side chain of aspartate is deprotonated and carries a net negative charge.\n\nAssuming this is the only change to the channel protein and it still correctly inserts into the cell membrane, which of the following is the most likely consequence of this mutation on the channel's ion transport properties?\n\nA. The channel will be permanently inactivated and will not transport any ions.\n\nB. The channel will lose its cation selectivity and begin to transport anions such as chloride ($Cl^{-}$).\n\nC.

The channel will lose its selectivity for monovalent cations and will begin to preferentially transport divalent cations such as calcium ($Ca^{2+}$).\n\nE. The channel's voltage-sensing and gating mechanism will be fundamentally altered, causing it to open at much lower membrane potentials.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the physical determinants of ion selectivity in cation channels. In wild-type $K^{+}$ channels, the selectivity filter coordinates a dehydrated $K^{+}$ using backbone carbonyl oxygens arranged to mimic its hydration shell. The glycine residue at a critical position contributes a small, neutral side chain that does not introduce additional fixed charge; thus the local electrostatic field in the filter is set mainly by backbone dipoles and is considered a relatively low-to-intermediate field-strength environment. In such environments, selectivity favors larger monovalent cations like $K^{+}$ over smaller monovalent cations like $Na^{+}$ due to optimal coordination geometry and dehydration-compensation balance.\n\nIntroduce the mutation: replacing glycine with aspartate introduces a side chain bearing a carboxylate that is deprotonated at physiological pH, carrying a net charge approximately $-e$. This adds a localized negative charge within the selectivity filter. The first-order electrostatic interaction energy between an ion of valence $z$ and a fixed site charge $-e$ at separation $r$ in a medium of dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ is\n$$\nU \\approx \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon}\\frac{(z e)(-e)}{r} \\propto -z.\n$$\nThus, purely electrostatically, increasing $z$ from $1$ to $2$ doubles the stabilizing interaction magnitude, favoring divalent cations such as $Ca^{2+}$ over monovalent cations.\n\nIon permeation selectivity can be framed by the free-energy balance for transferring an ion from water into the filter site:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(z) = \\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}}(z) + \\Delta G_{\\text{site}}(z),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{dehyd}}(z)$ is the dehydration penalty and $\\Delta G_{\\text{site}}(z)$ is the stabilization in the filter. In the Born approximation for hydration,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{hydr}} \\sim -\\frac{z^{2} e^{2}}{8\\pi \\epsilon_{0}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{w}}\\right)\\frac{1}{r_{i}},\n$$\nso dehydration penalties scale approximately with $z^{2}$ and inverse ionic radius $1/r_{i}$. To compensate such penalties, high-field-strength binding sites with negatively charged ligands (e.g., carboxylates) are required; these provide strong electrostatic stabilization that increases with $z$ and favors ions of higher charge density. This is the classical field-strength (Eisenman) perspective: carboxylate-rich sites are high-field-strength and preferentially bind smaller and/or higher-valence cations, notably $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nBy introducing a carboxylate into a filter that was previously neutral at that position, the local field strength increases. Consequently:\n- The filter’s electrostatic attraction to cations increases and scales with $z$, making divalent cations energetically more favorable relative to monovalent cations.\n- The added negative charge will not favor anions; rather, it will electrostatically repel them, so losing cation selectivity in favor of anions is unlikely.\n- The mutation occurs in the selectivity filter, not the canonical voltage-sensing domains; therefore, voltage-dependent gating thresholds are not the primary locus of effect.\n\nComparing options:\n- A is unlikely as a general prediction; while some filter mutations can abolish conduction, the most direct and robustly inferred effect of adding a negative charge to the filter concerns selectivity, not guaranteed complete inactivation.\n- B is inconsistent with electrostatics, since a negatively charged filter disfavors anions ($Cl^{-}$).\n- C is unlikely, because adding a high-field-strength ligand typically shifts selectivity away from the larger monovalent $K^{+}$ toward higher charge density ions, not toward enhanced $K^{+}$ selectivity.\n- D matches the field-strength argument: the filter loses monovalent selectivity and becomes relatively more favorable to divalent cations such as $Ca^{2+}$.\n- E focuses on voltage sensing and gating, which are determined primarily by separate structural elements; a selectivity filter substitution is not expected to fundamentally reset the voltage-activation threshold in the manner described.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is that the channel will lose its selectivity for monovalent cations and preferentially transport divalent cations such as $Ca^{2+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2339518"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we tackle a classic biophysical paradox that reveals the dynamic nature of ion selection: the anomalous mole fraction effect in calcium channels.

It is observed that in a solution completely devoid of calcium ions but containing a physiological concentration of sodium ions, the channel paradoxically allows a significant sodium current ($I_{Na}$) to pass when the membrane is depolarized. However, adding even micromolar amounts of calcium to the extracellular solution effectively blocks this sodium current.\n\nTo model this phenomenon, a simple competitive binding model is proposed for the channel's selectivity filter. The filter is assumed to contain a single, crucial binding site. The channel is considered 'blocked' to sodium current whenever this site is occupied by a $Ca^{2+}$ ion. Both $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$ ions from the extracellular solution compete for this site.
