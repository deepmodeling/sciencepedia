You will analyze how the balance between active pumping into the ER by SERCA pumps and passive leakage out of the ER maintains this crucial gradient, and predict the outcome when this delicate balance is pharmacologically disrupted.", "problem": "In a typical non-excitable mammalian cell, a steep concentration gradient for calcium ions (Ca²⁺) is maintained across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The concentration of free Ca²⁺ in the ER lumen is high, while the concentration in the cytosol is kept very low. This gradient is established and maintained primarily by the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pump, which actively transports Ca²⁺ from the cytosol into the ER lumen, a process that requires energy from ATP hydrolysis. This active transport counteracts a slow, passive leak of Ca²⁺ from the ER back into the cytosol through various channels.\n\nA cell biologist is studying intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling and treats a culture of these cells with thapsigargin, a compound known to be a highly specific and irreversible inhibitor of the SERCA pump. Assuming the cells are in a resting state before treatment, what are the expected immediate effects on the steady-state concentrations of free Ca²⁺ in the cytosol and in the ER lumen after the addition of thapsigargin?\n\nA. The cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration will increase, and the ER lumen Ca²⁺ concentration will decrease.\n\nB.

This practice [@problem_id:2329395] delves into the concept of a synaptic calcium \"microdomain,\" a tiny region where $[Ca^{2+}]$ skyrockets for microseconds to trigger neurotransmitter release. By comparing the effects of a \"fast\" chelator (BAPTA) and a \"slow\" chelator (EGTA), you will discover why the reaction kinetics of a calcium buffer are just as important as its binding affinity when trying to intercept a signal that operates on nanometer scales and microsecond timescales.", "problem": "An experimenter is investigating the properties of a specific synapse in the central nervous system (CNS). It is well established that neurotransmitter release at this particular synapse is triggered by calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) located in the presynaptic terminal. Electron microscopy has revealed that the synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmitter are positioned very close to the intracellular mouths of these channels. This spatial arrangement is known as a \"tight coupling\" configuration, meaning calcium ions only need to diffuse a nanometer-scale distance to reach their molecular sensor, synaptotagmin, on the vesicle membrane. Consequently, the time delay between calcium entry and vesicle fusion is extremely short, on the order of microseconds.\n\nThe experimenter has two different calcium-buffering agents, known as chelators, at their disposal:\n1.  **BAPTA** (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid): A \"fast\" chelator characterized by a very high on-rate, allowing it to bind free Ca²⁺ ions almost instantaneously.\n2.  **EGTA** (ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid): A \"slow\" chelator with a much lower on-rate than BAPTA. Although its overall binding affinity for Ca²⁺ is similar to BAPTA's at equilibrium, it takes significantly longer to capture the ions.\n\nThe experiment involves injecting a high concentration of either BAPTA or EGTA into the presynaptic terminal. Immediately after injection, the presynaptic axon is stimulated to fire a single action potential, and the subsequent \"phasic\" release of neurotransmitter is measured.\n\nBased on the principles of calcium microdomains and reaction kinetics at this tightly coupled synapse, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed?\n\nA. Both BAPTA and EGTA will effectively block neurotransmitter release.\n\nB. Neither BAPTA nor EGTA will have any effect on neurotransmitter release.\n\nC.
