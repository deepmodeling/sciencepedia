This first practice explores the most direct way to inhibit a signaling cascade: blocking the receptor. By examining a hypothetical scenario involving a Gs-coupled receptor, you will apply the principle of competitive antagonism to predict how a specific antagonist prevents an agonist from stimulating adenylyl cyclase and raising cAMP levels [@problem_id:2326452].", "problem": "A research group is investigating the signaling properties of a specific neuron type. These neurons express a G-protein coupled receptor that, when activated by its endogenous agonist, couples to a stimulatory G-protein (Gs). The activation of Gs leads to the stimulation of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nIn an experiment, a culture of these neurons is first pre-treated for a sufficient duration with a high concentration of a newly synthesized compound, which is known to be a competitive antagonist for the Gs-coupled receptor. Following this pre-treatment, the endogenous agonist is added to the culture medium at a concentration that would normally produce a robust increase in intracellular cAMP.\n\nAssuming the antagonist is effective and has no intrinsic activity of its own, what is the most likely immediate effect on the intracellular cAMP concentration in these pre-treated neurons upon addition of the agonist, compared to the baseline (resting) cAMP level before any compounds were added?\n\nA. The cAMP level will increase significantly, matching the response of neurons treated with only the agonist.\n\nB. The cAMP level will decrease significantly below the baseline level.\n\nC.

The cAMP level will increase to a level that is approximately half of the maximum response seen with the agonist alone.\n\nE. The cAMP level will increase massively, far exceeding the response seen with the agonist alone.", "solution": "The receptor in question is Gs-coupled, so agonist binding increases adenylyl cyclase activity and thereby increases intracellular cAMP. A competitive antagonist binds the same orthosteric site as the agonist without intrinsic efficacy, preventing agonist binding in a reversible, surmountable manner. In classical receptor theory with a competitive antagonist, the fractional occupancy by agonist is\n$$\n\\theta_{A}=\\frac{[A]/K_{A}}{1+[A]/K_{A}+[I]/K_{I}},\n$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the agonist concentration, $[I]$ is the antagonist concentration, and $K_{A},K_{I}$ are the respective equilibrium dissociation constants.\n\nAssuming effect above basal is proportional to agonist-occupied receptors, the agonist-evoked component of the response is\n$$\nE_{\\text{agonist}}=E_{\\max}\\frac{[A]}{[A]+K_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)}.\n$$\nThus, a competitive antagonist increases the apparent $K_{A}$ by the factor $\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)$, shifting the concentration-response curve to the right without changing $E_{\\max}$.\n\nWith pre-treatment by a high concentration of antagonist that is effective, $\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}$ is large, so for a fixed agonist concentration $[A]$ that would normally produce a robust increase, the denominator $[A]+K_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)$ is dominated by $K_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)$ and\n$$\nE_{\\text{agonist}}\\approx E_{\\max}\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right)}\\to 0\n$$\nas $[I]/K_{I}$ becomes large. Therefore, the agonist produces little to no additional cAMP over basal in the presence of sufficient competitive antagonist.\n\nBecause the antagonist has no intrinsic activity (i.e., it is not an inverse agonist), it does not alter basal receptor activity or basal cAMP when present alone. Consequently, upon addition of the agonist to antagonist-pre-treated neurons, the intracellular cAMP level remains approximately at the baseline (resting) level observed before any compounds were added.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate effect is no significant change from baseline, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326452"}, {"introduction": "Cells rarely operate on a simple on-off switch; they constantly integrate multiple, often conflicting, signals. This practice delves into this complexity by presenting a neuron that expresses both stimulatory (Gs) and inhibitory (Gi) receptors for the same neurotransmitter. You will explore how differential receptor affinity allows the cell to produce distinct, even opposite, responses at different ligand concentrations, providing a powerful lesson in signal integration [@problem_id:2326472].", "problem": "A specific population of neurons in the brain expresses two distinct subtypes of adenosine receptors, which are a class of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These are the A1 receptor and the A2A receptor. The signaling cascades for these receptors are as follows:\n- The A1 receptor is coupled to an inhibitory G-protein (Gi), which, upon activation, inhibits the enzyme adenylyl cyclase.\n- The A2A receptor is coupled to a stimulatory G-protein (Gs), which, upon activation, stimulates adenylyl cyclase.\nAdenylyl cyclase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) from its substrate, Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). In the absence of adenosine, these neurons maintain a stable, non-zero basal level of intracellular cAMP.\n\nIt is experimentally known that the A1 receptor has a much higher binding affinity for adenosine than the A2A receptor.\n\nConsider a scenario where these neurons are exposed to a very low concentration of adenosine. This concentration is sufficient to cause significant activation of the high-affinity A1 receptors but is too low to cause any meaningful activation of the low-affinity A2A receptors. Based on this information, what is the most likely immediate effect on the intracellular environment of these neurons?\n\nA. A significant increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP.\n\nB. A significant decrease in the intracellular concentration of cAMP.\n\nC. No change in the intracellular concentration of cAMP.\n\nD. A significant decrease in the intracellular concentration of ATP.\n\nE. Activation of both Gi and Gs signaling pathways simultaneously.", "solution": "Adenosine receptors A1 and A2A are GPCRs that couple to different G proteins with opposite effects on adenylyl cyclase (AC). By definition of GPCR coupling, A1 couples to Gi, which inhibits AC, and A2A couples to Gs, which stimulates AC. Adenylyl cyclase synthesizes cAMP from ATP; thus AC activity sets the synthesis rate of cAMP. In the basal state (no adenosine), the intracellular cAMP concentration is nonzero and steady, implying a dynamic balance between synthesis and degradation. Denote the cAMP concentration by $C(t)$, AC activity by $A$, the synthesis rate constant by $k_{s}$, and the degradation rate constant (due to phosphodiesterases) by $k_{d}$. A standard mass-balance model for cAMP yields\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{s} A - k_{d} C.\n$$\nIn the absence of adenosine the steady state $C_{0}$ satisfies\n$$\n0 = k_{s} A_{0} - k_{d} C_{0} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k_{s} A_{0} = k_{d} C_{0},\n$$\nwhere $A_{0}$ is the basal AC activity.\n\nAt a very low adenosine concentration, only the high-affinity A1 receptors are significantly activated, while the low-affinity A2A receptors remain essentially inactive. By the principle of Gi coupling, A1 activation decreases AC activity: $A$ is reduced from $A_{0}$ to $A' = A_{0} - \\Delta A$ with $\\Delta A > 0$. Immediately after this reduction, $C$ is still approximately $C_{0}$, but the synthesis term is decreased to $k_{s} A' = k_{s}(A_{0} - \\Delta A) = k_{s} A_{0} - k_{s} \\Delta A$. Therefore, the instantaneous rate of change becomes\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt}\\bigg|_{t^{+}} = \\left(k_{s} A_{0} - k_{s} \\Delta A\\right) - k_{d} C_{0} = \\underbrace{k_{s} A_{0} - k_{d} C_{0}}_{=\\,0} - k_{s} \\Delta A = - k_{s} \\Delta A < 0.\n$$\nBecause $k_{s} \\Delta A > 0$, the immediate effect is a net decrease in $C(t)$, i.e., a significant decrease in intracellular cAMP.\n\nThis rules out an increase in cAMP (A) and no change (C). It also rules out a significant decrease in ATP (D), since AC activity is inhibited and ATP consumption for cAMP synthesis would decrease rather than increase immediately. Finally, simultaneous activation of Gi and Gs (E) is inconsistent with the stated low adenosine level that selectively activates high-affinity A1 but not low-affinity A2A receptors.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate effect is a significant decrease in intracellular cAMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2326472"}, {"introduction": "Our understanding of receptor function has evolved to include receptors that are active even without an agonist, a phenomenon known as constitutive activity. This practice challenges you to apply this advanced concept by distinguishing between a neutral antagonist, which simply blocks the receptor, and an inverse agonist, which actively reduces its basal signaling.
