By working through this scenario, you'll develop a fundamental intuition for how molecular changes are directly reflected in electrophysiological recordings.", "problem": "In a voltage-clamp experiment, a neuroscientist studies the properties of a specific type of voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channel expressed in a cell. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of $K^{+}$ are such that for any membrane potential greater than -90 mV, there is an outward electrochemical driving force on $K^{+}$ ions.\n\nThe experiment consists of holding the cell's membrane potential at a resting value of -80 mV, where the channels are closed, and then stepping the potential to +20 mV for a duration of 100 milliseconds (ms) before returning to -80 mV. With the normal, wild-type channels, this voltage step elicits a rapidly activating outward current that also rapidly inactivates, meaning the current rises to a peak and then decays back to near zero within tens of milliseconds, even while the membrane is held at +20 mV. This type of inactivation is known as N-type or \"ball-and-chain\" inactivation, where a tethered domain on the N-terminus of the channel protein physically occludes the ion-conducting pore.\n\nThe neuroscientist then repeats the experiment on a cell expressing a mutant version of the same channel. This mutation involves a deletion of the N-terminal \"ball\" domain, but leaves the voltage-sensing domains and the pore region of the channel intact.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected current trace during the 100 ms step to +20 mV for the mutant channel, as compared to the wild-type?\n\nA. No current will be observed because the channel is unable to open in response to the voltage change.\n\nB. A sustained inward current will be observed for the entire duration of the 100 ms step.\n\nC.

The channel will open, but the current will be smaller in amplitude and will still show rapid inactivation similar to the wild-type.", "solution": "We analyze the ionic current under voltage clamp using the standard conductance-based formulation. The potassium current during a voltage step is given by\n$$\nI_{K}(t)=g_{K}(t)\\left(V_{m}-E_{K}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $V_{m}$ is the command potential, $E_{K}$ is the potassium reversal potential, and $g_{K}(t)$ is the time-dependent conductance reflecting channel gating. The sign of the current is determined by the driving force $\\left(V_{m}-E_{K}\\right)$ and the direction of $K^{+}$ flow. By the problem statement, for any $V_{m}>-90\\,\\text{mV}$ there is an outward driving force on $K^{+}$, so at $V_{m}=+20\\,\\text{mV}$ we have\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{K}>0,\n$$\nwhich implies an outward current whenever channels are open.\n\nFor voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels with N-type inactivation (wild-type), the conductance can be written as\n$$\ng_{K}(t)=\\bar{g}_{K}\\,m^{p}(t)\\,h_{N}(t),\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{g}_{K}$ is the maximal conductance, $m(t)$ is the activation gating variable that rises rapidly upon depolarization, $p$ is the activation power (channel subunit cooperativity), and $h_{N}(t)$ is the N-type inactivation variable that rapidly declines from $1$ toward $0$ after opening due to the ball-and-chain occlusion.

Thus activation gating remains functional and rapid upon depolarization. However, the N-type inactivation mechanism is abolished. In the gating description, this corresponds to $h_{N}(t)$ being effectively fixed near $1$ (no occlusion), so\n$$\ng_{K}(t)\\approx \\bar{g}_{K}\\,m^{p}(t),\n$$\nwith $m(t)$ approaching its depolarized steady state and not being driven to zero by N-type inactivation.
