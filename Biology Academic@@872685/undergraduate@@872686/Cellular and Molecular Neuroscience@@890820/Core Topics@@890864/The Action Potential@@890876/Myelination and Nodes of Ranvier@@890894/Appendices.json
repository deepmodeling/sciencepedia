{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To understand how myelinated axons transmit signals so efficiently, we must first look at the molecular level. Saltatory conduction relies on the action potential being rapidly regenerated at the nodes of Ranvier. This exercise asks you to identify the specific molecular machinery responsible for this critical step, connecting the macroscopic phenomenon of nerve conduction to its microscopic, ion-channel-based underpinnings.", "problem": "In the vertebrate nervous system, many axons are ensheathed by myelin, a lipid-rich layer that is periodically interrupted by short, exposed gaps known as the nodes of Ranvier. This structure facilitates a highly efficient mode of signal propagation called saltatory conduction, where the action potential appears to \"jump\" from one node to the next. The myelin sheath acts as an electrical insulator, increasing the resistance of the axonal membrane and decreasing its capacitance, which allows the depolarization from an action potential at one node to spread rapidly and passively to the next. However, this passive current would decay with distance if not for a regenerative process at each node. To ensure the fidelity of the signal, the action potential must be robustly regenerated at each successive node of Ranvier.\n\nThis regeneration involves a rapid, localized, and all-or-none depolarization of the nodal membrane. Which one of the following molecular components is concentrated at an extremely high density in the membrane of the nodes of Ranvier to specifically enable this rapid regenerative depolarization?\n\nA. Voltage-gated sodium channels\n\nB. Voltage-gated potassium channels\n\nC. Ligand-gated ion channels\n\nD. Sodium-potassium pumps\n\nE. Voltage-gated calcium channels", "solution": "The problem asks which molecular component, concentrated at very high density in the nodes of Ranvier, enables the rapid, localized, all-or-none regenerative depolarization that re-amplifies the action potential during saltatory conduction.\n\nFirst, consider what “rapid, localized, all-or-none depolarization” requires. Regenerative depolarization is driven by a fast inward current that increases with depolarization, providing positive feedback. In the Hodgkin–Huxley framework, this is the transient sodium current\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} = g_{\\mathrm{Na}}(V,t)\\,\\big(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\big),\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\mathrm{Na}}(V,t)$ increases steeply with depolarization due to voltage-dependent activation. When $V$ approaches threshold, an increase in $g_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ makes $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ more inward because $V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ is negative, producing further depolarization and thus an all-or-none spike. Maximizing the peak inward current requires a high maximal sodium conductance, i.e., a high density of voltage-gated sodium channels, $g_{\\mathrm{Na,max}}$.\n\nSecond, the biophysical role of myelin is to increase membrane resistance and decrease capacitance, which increases the length constant and speeds passive spread between nodes, but passive current decays with distance. Therefore, at each node, regeneration must be rapid and robust, necessitating a large, fast, voltage-dependent inward conductance. This is supplied by voltage-gated sodium channels densely packed at nodes of Ranvier, ensuring that the nodal membrane crosses threshold and produces a full action potential.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A. Voltage-gated sodium channels: These provide the fast, inward, depolarizing current required for rapid, all-or-none regeneration. They are known to be concentrated at extremely high density at nodes of Ranvier.\n- B. Voltage-gated potassium channels: These predominantly mediate repolarization and are enriched at juxtaparanodes; they do not provide the initial regenerative depolarization.\n- C. Ligand-gated ion channels: These require neurotransmitter binding and are not responsible for nodal action potential regeneration.\n- D. Sodium-potassium pumps: These restore ionic gradients slowly and do not generate rapid depolarization.\n- E. Voltage-gated calcium channels: These are key for synaptic transmission and other functions but are not the primary drivers of nodal regenerative depolarization.\n\nTherefore, the molecular component concentrated at nodes of Ranvier to enable rapid regenerative depolarization is voltage-gated sodium channels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2345261"}, {"introduction": "Having established the crucial role of voltage-gated sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier, we can further test their function with a thought experiment. This practice presents a hypothetical scenario involving a toxin that selectively blocks these channels. By predicting the consequence for a propagating action potential, you will reinforce your understanding of why the regenerative process at the nodes is absolutely essential for saltatory conduction.", "problem": "An investigator is studying the properties of a myelinated motor neuron. A novel neurotoxin, Noditoxin, is applied to the neuron. This toxin is known to be a highly selective antagonist, binding to and inactivating voltage-gated sodium ($Na^{+}$) channels. Its unique property is that it only affects the channels located within the nodes of Ranvier, leaving the channels at the axon hillock and along the internodal membrane (under the myelin sheath) unaffected. Following the application of the toxin, a suprathreshold stimulus is applied to the axon hillock, successfully initiating a single action potential.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence for the propagation of this action potential along the axon?\n\nA. The action potential will propagate along the axon at a significantly increased speed.\n\nB. The action potential will fail to propagate past the first node of Ranvier.\n\nC. The membrane at the nodes of Ranvier will become permanently hyperpolarized.\n\nD. The action potential will switch from saltatory to slow, continuous conduction along the entire length of the axon.\n\nE. The action potential will propagate to the axon terminal without any change in its characteristics.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physiological mechanism: in a myelinated axon, action potentials propagate by saltatory conduction, where depolarizing current generated at one spike initiation zone (axon hillock or a node) spreads passively under the myelin to the next node of Ranvier, where a high density of voltage-gated sodium channels causes a regenerative influx of $Na^{+}$ that brings the node to threshold and triggers the next action potential. This repeats node-to-node.\n\nGiven the setup, a suprathreshold stimulus at the axon hillock initiates an action potential there because the axon hillock is unaffected by Noditoxin. The toxin selectively inactivates voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channels only at nodes of Ranvier.\n\nThe passive spread of depolarization along the internode is described by the cable equation. In the steady-state spatial form, the membrane potential deflection $V(x)$ decays with length constant $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}V}{dx^{2}}=\\frac{V}{\\lambda^{2}},\\quad V(x)=V_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda=\\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}$ for the cable, with $r_{m}$ the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_{i}$ the internal (axial) resistance per unit length. Myelination increases $r_{m}$ and decreases membrane capacitance, which increases $\\lambda$ and speeds saltatory conduction, but regeneration at nodes remains essential.\n\nAt a node of Ranvier, the rapid upstroke of the action potential normally depends on a large transient inward sodium current via voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ channels. The nodal membrane dynamics can be summarized by\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV}{dt}=I_{\\text{axial}}-g_{Na}(V-E_{Na})-g_{K}(V-E_{K})-g_{L}(V-E_{L}),\n$$\nwhere $I_{\\text{axial}}$ is the axial (passive) current arriving from the previous active site, $g_{Na}$ is the voltage-gated sodium conductance, $g_{K}$ is the potassium conductance, and $g_{L}$ is the leak conductance. Noditoxin effectively sets nodal $g_{Na}\\approx 0$, eliminating the fast inward current term required for regenerative depolarization. Consequently, even if the arriving passive current transiently depolarizes the node, the node cannot reach threshold to trigger an action potential because the necessary positive feedback via $Na^{+}$ channel activation is blocked.\n\nTherefore, the action potential initiated at the axon hillock will passively spread to the first node but will fail to be regenerated there, so propagation will fail at or before the first node of Ranvier.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because blocking nodal $Na^{+}$ channels abolishes regeneration and cannot increase speed.\n- B is correct: without nodal $Na^{+}$ channels, the action potential fails to propagate past the first node.\n- C is incorrect: blocking $Na^{+}$ channels does not cause permanent hyperpolarization; the resting potential remains primarily governed by $K^{+}$ leak and other baseline currents.\n- D is incorrect: continuous conduction along the myelinated internode cannot occur effectively due to sparse $Na^{+}$ channels under myelin and high membrane resistance; passive spread decays as $V(x)=V_{0}\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ and cannot sustain propagation along the entire length.\n- E is incorrect: nodal inactivation profoundly alters propagation, preventing continuation.\n\nThus, the immediate consequence is failure of propagation at the first node of Ranvier.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2345247"}, {"introduction": "The structure of a myelinated axon is finely tuned for optimal conduction speed, balancing the passive travel time along internodes with the active regeneration time at nodes. This exercise presents a quantitative model to explore what happens when this structure is altered, a common outcome following neural injury and repair. By calculating the change in conduction velocity, you will analyze the functional trade-offs of myelination and gain a deeper appreciation for the biophysical principles that govern neural signaling speed.", "problem": "In the study of neural repair, the process of remyelination is critical for restoring function after injury to a myelinated axon. Consider a large-diameter axon in the peripheral nervous system that has suffered a minor, localized demyelinating lesion. Following the injury, Schwann cells remyelinate the affected segment, but the newly formed internodes (the myelinated segments between nodes of Ranvier) are, on average, 50% shorter than the original, developmentally-established internodes.\n\nTo model the functional consequence of this change, we can approximate the process of saltatory conduction. The total time ($T_{seg}$) for an action potential to propagate across one internodal segment (from one node of Ranvier to the next) is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant nodal delay ($t_{node}$), which represents the time required for ionic currents to depolarize the nodal membrane to threshold and initiate a new action potential. This time is independent of the internodal length.\n2.  An internodal conduction time ($t_{int}$), which is the time taken for the electrical signal to propagate passively along the myelinated axon segment to the next node. This time is directly proportional to the internodal length ($L$), such that $t_{int} = \\alpha L$, where $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant determined by the axon's intrinsic cable properties.\n\nIn a healthy, uninjured portion of this axon, the nodal delay ($t_{node}$) is known to constitute 25% of the total segment propagation time ($T_{seg, orig}$). Assume the nodal delay time $t_{node}$ and the proportionality constant $\\alpha$ are unchanged in the remyelinated segment.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the new conduction velocity in the remyelinated segment ($v_{new}$) to the original conduction velocity ($v_{orig}$). Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $L$ denote internodal length. For propagation across one segment, the total time is:\n$$T_{seg}=t_{node}+\\alpha L$$\nThe conduction velocity over that segment is:\n$$v=\\frac{L}{T_{seg}}$$\n\nIn the original (healthy) segment, we have $T_{seg,orig}=t_{node}+\\alpha L_{orig}$. Given that $t_{node}$ constitutes one quarter of $T_{seg,orig}$, we can write:\n$$t_{node}=\\frac{1}{4}T_{seg,orig}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(t_{node}+\\alpha L_{orig}\\right)$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$4t_{node} = t_{node} + \\alpha L_{orig} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\alpha L_{orig}=3t_{node}$$\nHence, the original velocity is:\n$$v_{orig}=\\frac{L_{orig}}{t_{node}+\\alpha L_{orig}}=\\frac{L_{orig}}{t_{node}+3t_{node}}=\\frac{L_{orig}}{4t_{node}}$$\n\nThe remyelinated segment has internodes that are one half as long:\n$$L_{new}=\\frac{1}{2}L_{orig}$$\nThus, the new segment propagation time is:\n$$T_{seg,new}=t_{node}+\\alpha L_{new}=t_{node}+\\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{2}L_{orig}\\right)=t_{node}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(3t_{node}\\right)=\\frac{5}{2}t_{node}$$\nThe new conduction velocity is:\n$$v_{new}=\\frac{L_{new}}{T_{seg,new}}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}L_{orig}}{\\frac{5}{2}t_{node}}=\\frac{1}{5}\\frac{L_{orig}}{t_{node}}$$\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n$$\\frac{v_{new}}{v_{orig}}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{5}\\frac{L_{orig}}{t_{node}}}{\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{L_{orig}}{t_{node}}}=\\frac{1/5}{1/4}=\\frac{4}{5}=0.800$$\nThe ratio to three significant figures is 0.800.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.800}$$", "id": "2345296"}]}
