Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are crucial for terminating the action potential by repolarizing the membrane back to its resting state. This exercise [@problem_id:2349996] invites you to think like a neuropharmacologist, predicting how a hypothetical toxin that delays the opening of Kv channels would alter the action potential waveform and duration.", "problem": "In neurobiology, the shape and duration of an action potential are critically determined by the precise timing of the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels. A hypothetical neurotoxin, known as prolongotoxin, is being investigated. Its sole effect is to bind to the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels responsible for repolarization. This binding alters the channel's conformation, causing the voltage threshold required for its activation to shift to a significantly more positive (i.e., more depolarized) membrane potential. Assume that the toxin does not affect the resting membrane potential, the voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels, or the peak voltage reached during the action potential.\n\nBased on this specific mechanism of action, what would be the primary and most immediate effect of prolongotoxin on the waveform of a single action potential?\n\nA. The resting membrane potential will become more negative (hyperpolarized).\n\nB. The rate of depolarization will be significantly reduced.\n\nC. The duration of the repolarization phase will be substantially increased.\n\nD. The threshold potential required to trigger an action potential will be raised.\n\nE.

A slower rate of repolarization directly increases the duration of the repolarization phase and thereby prolongs the action potential duration.\n\nBy the problem’s assumptions, the resting membrane potential, the Nav channels, and the action potential peak are unaffected. Thus:\n- The resting membrane potential does not become more negative, because leak and equilibrium potentials are unchanged and Kv channels are largely closed at rest; option A is incorrect.\n- The depolarization rate is governed mainly by Nav activation, which is unaffected; option B is incorrect.\n- The threshold for initiating an action potential is set primarily by Nav activation and the balance of inward versus outward currents near rest; with Nav unchanged and resting properties unaffected, the threshold is not raised; option D is incorrect.\n- A decrease in repolarization duration would require enhanced or earlier Kv activation, which is the opposite of the toxin’s effect; option E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most immediate effect is a substantial increase in the duration of the repolarization phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2349996"}, {"introduction": "While the gating of a channel determines its conductance, the actual flow of ions—the current—also depends critically on the electrochemical driving force.

In Hodgkin–Huxley terms, this increases $\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}$ without changing the activation kinetics or the maximal conductance. Consequently, after an action potential, $n(t)$ decays more slowly, so $g_{K}(t)=\\bar{g}_{K}\\,n(t)^{4}$ remains elevated for a longer time. Because $I_{K}(t)$ drives the membrane potential toward $E_{K}$, a prolonged elevation of $g_{K}$ prolongs and often deepens the afterhyperpolarization.\n\nDefine the total membrane conductance after a spike as\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{tot}}(t)=g_{L}+g_{K}(t)+g_{\\mathrm{other}},\n$$\nwith $g_{L}$ the leak conductance and $g_{\\mathrm{other}}$ denoting any other resting conductances unaffected by the toxin.

Moreover, the membrane potential is held more negative by the increased $I_{K}$, increasing the depolarization required to reach threshold. Both effects increase the stimulus intensity needed to elicit another action potential during this period.\n\nThe absolute refractory period is determined primarily by the inactivation and recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels, often represented by the gate variable $h(t)$, which Anemonin-K does not affect. Thus, the absolute refractory period is not lengthened by this toxin. In contrast, the relative refractory period is defined as the interval after the absolute refractory period during which a stronger-than-normal stimulus is required to evoke an action potential. Since $g_{K}(t)$ decays more slowly (larger $\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}$), the time it takes for $g_{K}(t)$ to return close to baseline—and hence for threshold and input resistance to return to normal—increases. If $g_{K}(t)$ decays approximately as $g_{K}(t)\\approx g_{K,0}+\\Delta g_{K}\\exp\\big(-t/\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}\\big)$, then the time to reach a given near-baseline level is proportional to $\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}$, so increasing $\\tau_{n,\\mathrm{deact}}$ lengthens that interval.\n\nTherefore, Anemonin-K lengthens the relative refractory period, without lengthening the absolute refractory period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2350037"}]}
