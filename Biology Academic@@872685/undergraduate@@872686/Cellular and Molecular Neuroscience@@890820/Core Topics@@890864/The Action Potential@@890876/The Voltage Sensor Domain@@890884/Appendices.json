Their activation is controlled by a specialized region within the protein called the voltage sensor domain. In a typical voltage-gated sodium channel, each of the four homologous domains contains a transmembrane segment known as S4, which is rich in positively charged amino acids (e.g., Arginine, Lysine). The movement of these S4 segments in response to changes in the membrane electric field leads to the opening of the channel's pore.\n\nThe sensitivity of a channel to voltage is often characterized by its voltage-activation curve, which plots the probability of channel opening as a function of membrane potential. A key parameter from this curve is the half-activation potential, denoted as $V_{1/2}$, which is the membrane potential at which 50% of the channels are in the open state.\n\nConsider a wild-type (WT) voltage-gated sodium channel with a half-activation potential $V_{1/2, \\text{WT}}$. A team of neurophysiologists creates a series of three mutant channels by systematically neutralizing the four most critical positive charges in one of the S4 segments.

The channel's voltage-sensing domain (VSD) is a module that contains the transmembrane segments S1 through S4. The S4 segment is rich in positively charged amino acid residues and serves as the primary voltage sensor. Its movement in response to changes in the membrane potential gives rise to a small, transient \"gating current\". This movement is mechanically coupled to the opening of the channel's central pore, which permits a much larger \"ionic current\" of sodium ions to flow across the membrane.\n\nTo probe the dynamics of the VSD, the researcher uses site-directed mutagenesis to replace two native amino acids with cysteine residues. One cysteine is engineered into the S2 segment and the other into the S4 segment, at positions that are spatially close to each other when the channel is in its closed, resting state. Cysteine residues are unique in that they can form a covalent disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions, but remain as free sulfhydryl groups under reducing conditions.\n\nThe researcher expresses these mutant channels in a cell line and utilizes the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to measure their electrical activity. The experiment is performed under two distinct conditions:\n1.  **Reducing Condition:** The extracellular solution contains a strong reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), which prevents the formation of any disulfide bonds.\n2.  **Oxidizing Condition:** After a thorough washout of the DTT, the cells are exposed to an environment that promotes the formation of a disulfide bond between the two engineered cysteines, thereby tethering the S2 and S4 segments.\n\nLet $Q_{g,red}$ and $G_{peak,red}$ represent the total gating charge and the peak ionic conductance, respectively, measured during a strong depolarizing voltage step under the reducing condition. Similarly, let $Q_{g,ox}$ and $G_{peak,ox}$ be the corresponding values measured under the oxidizing condition.\n\nAssuming the disulfide bond forms with high efficiency in the oxidizing condition and effectively \"locks\" the S4 segment to the S2 segment in its resting conformation, which of the following outcomes is most expected?\n\nA. $Q_{g,ox} \\approx 0$ and $G_{peak,ox} \\approx 0$\n\nB. $Q_{g,ox} \\approx Q_{g,red}$ and $G_{peak,ox} \\approx 0$\n\nC. $Q_{g,ox} \\approx 0$ and $G_{peak,ox} \\approx G_{peak,red}$\n\nD. $Q_{g,ox} \\approx 0.5 \\cdot Q_{g,red}$ and $G_{peak,ox} \\approx 0.5 \\cdot G_{peak,red}$\n\nE. $Q_{g,ox} \\approx Q_{g,red}$ and $G_{peak,ox} \\approx G_{peak,red}$", "solution": "We identify the relevant physical principles and variables:\n- The gating current arises from movement of effective gating charges in the voltage-sensing domain (VSD), primarily the positively charged residues on S4. The total gating charge during a voltage step is the time integral of the gating current:\n$$\nQ_{g}=\\int I_{g}(t)\\,dt.\n$$\n- The macroscopic ionic conductance during activation is determined by the number of channels, the single-channel conductance, and the open probability:\n$$\nG(t)=N\\,\\gamma\\,P_{o}(t),\n$$\nso that the peak ionic conductance under a strong depolarization is\n$$\nG_{peak}=N\\,\\gamma\\,P_{o,peak}.\n$$\n\nUnder reducing conditions (DTT present), no disulfide bond forms; S4 moves normally in response to depolarization. In this case, a nonzero effective charge per sensor, denoted $z_{eff}$, is displaced across the membrane electric field, producing a nonzero gating current and hence a nonzero total gating charge $Q_{g,red}0$. The mechanical coupling between S4 motion and the pore gate allows the open probability to rise, yielding $G_{peak,red}0$.\n\nUnder oxidizing conditions with high-efficiency disulfide formation between the engineered cysteines in S2 and S4, the S4 helix is tethered to S2 in the resting conformation. By the problem’s assumption, this effectively prevents S4 from undergoing its depolarization-driven movement. The consequences follow directly:\n1. For gating charge: if S4 does not move, there is no displacement of its effective charge across the field. Equivalently, the effective displacement that contributes to gating charge is suppressed, so the net charge transfer is eliminated. Symbolically, if the fraction of sensors that move is $\\Delta f$, then $Q_{g}\\propto N\\,z_{eff}\\,q\\,\\Delta f$, and here $\\Delta f\\to 0$ due to the tether, implying\n$$\nQ_{g,ox}\\approx 0.\n$$\n2. For ionic conductance: opening of the pore requires activation of the VSD and transmission of this movement to the pore gate. If S4 is locked in the resting conformation, the activation gate cannot be driven to the open conformation. Thus the open probability remains near zero, $P_{o,peak}^{(ox)}\\approx 0$, and therefore\n$$\nG_{peak,ox}=N\\,\\gamma\\,P_{o,peak}^{(ox)}\\approx 0.\n$$\n\nTherefore, when the S4 segment is locked to S2 in its resting conformation, both the total gating charge and the peak ionic conductance are expected to be approximately zero under a strong depolarization.
