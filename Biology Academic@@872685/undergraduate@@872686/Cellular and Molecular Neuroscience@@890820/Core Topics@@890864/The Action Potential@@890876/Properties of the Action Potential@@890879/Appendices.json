Opening voltage-gated sodium channels increases the sodium conductance $g_{Na}$, allowing sodium-specific current to flow, but $V_{m}$ remains equal to the imposed value due to the clamp circuitry.\n\n3) The instantaneous sodium current through its channels is given by the linear (Ohmic) relation\n$$\nI_{Na}=g_{Na}\\left(V_{m}-E_{Na}\\right).\n$$\nThis equation encodes the electrochemical driving force $V_{m}-E_{Na}$.

The direction of sodium movement depends only on the sodium electrochemical gradient and $V_{m}$, not on extracellular potassium concentration or permeabilities of other ions for the instantaneous sodium current through sodium channels. Under voltage clamp, other permeabilities affect total membrane current, but they do not reverse the sign of the sodium-specific current determined by $V_{m}-E_{Na}$.\n\nTherefore, immediately upon opening the sodium channels at $V_{m}=0\\ \\text{mV}$ with $E_{Na}=+58\\ \\text{mV}$, there is a net inward flow of $Na^{+}$ ions.\n\nThe correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2348929"}, {"introduction": "While the driving force tells us which way ions will flow, the Nernst potential tells us the point at which that flow stops.

Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\nB. Rising phase depolarization rate. The upstroke is driven by $I_{Na} = g_{Na}(V,t)(V - E_{Na})$, with rapid activation of $g_{Na}$ and relatively slow activation of $g_{K}$. Blocking $g_{K}$ does not reduce $g_{Na}$, and early during the rising phase $I_{K}$ contributes little. Thus, the rate $dV/dt$ during the upstroke is not significantly reduced; if anything, removing opposing outward current would not slow it. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\nC. Action potential duration via repolarization. Repolarization normally relies on the increase of $g_{K}(V,t)$, which drives $V$ toward $E_{K}$. With TEA, $g_{K}(V,t)$ is suppressed, so after the peak,\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV}{dt} \\;\\approx\\; -I_{leak} \\;-\\; I_{Na,\\text{residual}},\n$$\nand once $I_{Na}$ inactivates, the return to rest is dominated by $I_{leak}$, with an effective time constant\n$$\n\\tau \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{C_{m}}{g_{leak}} \\quad \\text{instead of} \\quad \\tau \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{C_{m}}{g_{leak} + g_{K,\\text{VG}}},\n$$\nwhich is markedly larger. Hence repolarization is slowed and the spike duration is prolonged. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nD. Peak amplitude. The peak occurs when the net membrane current approaches zero, which is largely determined by $I_{Na}$ activation and inactivation and the approach of $V$ toward $E_{Na}$. Blocking $I_{K}$ does not increase $E_{Na}$ or $g_{Na}$; thus, the peak is not substantially increased. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nE. After-hyperpolarization (AHP). AHP results from sustained elevated $g_{K,\\text{VG}}$ after the spike, pulling $V$ closer to $E_{K}$ below rest. TEA reduces $g_{K,\\text{VG}}$, so the AHP becomes smaller or absent, not more pronounced. Therefore, E is incorrect.\n\nThe principal effect is a marked prolongation of the action potential due to slowed repolarization when voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels are blocked.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2348915"}]}
