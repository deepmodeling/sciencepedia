This requires a sophisticated delivery system known as axonal transport, which functions like a cellular highway. This exercise [@problem_id:2345996] challenges you to predict the consequences of disrupting this highway by inhibiting a key motor protein, helping to solidify your understanding of how neuropeptide-filled vesicles reach their destination.", "problem": "In a typical neuron, neuropeptides are synthesized as larger precursor proteins on ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cell body (soma). These precursors are then processed and packaged into specialized vesicles known as Dense-Core Vesicles (DCVs) by the Golgi apparatus, also located in the soma. These vesicles must then be transported to their release sites, which are often at the axon terminal. Consider an experiment where a mature, healthy neuron in culture is treated with a novel pharmacological agent that selectively and completely inhibits the function of all kinesin motor proteins. The agent has no effect on dynein motors, myosin motors, or the process of vesicle exocytosis. After several hours of this treatment, where would you expect to find the highest concentration of newly synthesized DCVs?\n\nA. Primarily accumulated at the axon terminal.\n\nB.

Primarily found within lysosomes following degradation.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the location of newly synthesized Dense-Core Vesicles (DCVs) in a neuron where the motor protein kinesin is inhibited. To solve this, we must trace the normal pathway of DCV synthesis and transport and then consider the effect of the inhibition.\n\nStep 1: Understand the synthesis and packaging of neuropeptides.\nAs stated in the problem, neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell body (soma). The process involves transcription of the gene in the nucleus, translation of the messenger RNA on ribosomes attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and subsequent processing and packaging into DCVs by the Golgi apparatus. This entire manufacturing process occurs within the soma.\n\nStep 2: Understand the transport of DCVs.\nOnce packaged, DCVs must be moved from the soma to their sites of release, typically the axon terminal. This long-distance movement is an active process called axonal transport, which occurs along microtubule tracks that run the length of the axon.\n\nStep 3: Identify the roles of specific motor proteins.\nAxonal transport is mediated by motor proteins that use Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to \"walk\" along microtubules.\n- **Kinesin** is the primary motor protein responsible for **anterograde transport**, which is the movement of cargo *away* from the cell body and *towards* the axon terminal (i.e., from the minus-end to the plus-end of the microtubules).\n- **Dynein** is the primary motor protein responsible for **retrograde transport**, which is the movement of cargo *towards* the cell body *from* the axon terminal.\n\nStep 4: Apply the experimental condition.\nThe problem states that a pharmacological agent has selectively and completely inhibited kinesin. This means that anterograde transport is blocked. Newly synthesized DCVs, which are produced in the soma, rely on kinesin to be transported down the axon to the terminal.\n\nStep 5: Deduce the consequence of the inhibition.\nSince the \"outward\" transport mechanism (anterograde transport via kinesin) is disabled, the DCVs that are continuously being produced in the soma have no way to leave it. They cannot be transported down the axon. As a result, they will accumulate at their site of synthesis.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. Primarily accumulated at the axon terminal: This is incorrect. To reach the axon terminal, DCVs require anterograde transport, which is precisely what has been blocked.\n- B. Primarily accumulated within the cell body (soma): This is correct. The DCVs are produced in the soma and cannot be transported out, leading to their accumulation there.\n- C. Evenly distributed along the entire length of the axon: This is incorrect. An even distribution would imply that transport is occurring normally or that the vesicles are freely diffusing, neither of which is the case. The block in transport will prevent them from entering the axon in the first place.\n- D. Primarily accumulated in the dendrites: This is incorrect. While some DCVs might be targeted to dendrites, the primary site of synthesis is the soma, and the block on kinesin-mediated transport would cause them to bottleneck there before they could be distributed anywhere else. The most significant accumulation will be in the soma.\n- E. Primarily found within lysosomes following degradation: This is incorrect. The problem gives no information to suggest that a failure to transport triggers immediate degradation. While vesicles may eventually be degraded, the primary and immediate effect of the transport block is accumulation, not degradation.\n\nTherefore, the highest concentration of newly synthesized DCVs will be found in the cell body (soma).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2345996"}, {"introduction": "Once packaged into vesicles, neuropeptide precursors are not yet ready for action; they must be precisely tailored by a sequence of specific enzymes.

They become active as the granule acidifies and cleave the pro-protein on the C-terminal side of paired basic residues (e.g., `Lys-Arg`, `Lys-Lys`).\n2.  **Carboxypeptidase E (CPE):** This exopeptidase is also packaged into secretory granules. It functions in the acidic environment of the granules to sequentially remove the basic residues (Lysine, Arginine) from the C-terminus of peptides cleaved by PCs.\n3.  **Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM):** This enzyme, located in secretory granules, catalyzes the C-terminal amidation of peptides that have a glycine residue at their C-terminus after processing by PCs and CPE. This amidation reaction is crucial for the biological activity of many neuropeptides.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered neuronal cell line in which a mutation in the gene for CPE causes the enzyme to be incorrectly sorted. Instead of being packaged into secretory granules, the mutant CPE is retained within the cis-Golgi network. Assume the pH of the cis-Golgi is approximately 6.7, rendering CPE essentially inactive, while the pH of the secretory granules drops to 6.0, where PCs and PAM are fully active.

Lys-Lys between Gly and Ser (positions 13-14 flanked by Gly at 12 and Ser at 15).\n\nCleavage by PCs on the C-terminal side of each paired basic site generates a fragment beginning immediately after the first pair and ending at the second pair’s C-terminal residue. Thus, PC processing yields the intermediate:\nTyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys.\n\nUnder normal conditions, Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) in secretory granules would sequentially remove the C-terminal basic residues (Lys-Lys), producing:\nTyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly.\n\nSubsequently, Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) would recognize the C-terminal glycine and catalyze C-terminal amidation, removing the glycine and generating:\nTyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-NH2.\n\nIn the engineered cell line, however, CPE is mis-sorted to the cis-Golgi and is inactive at pH 6.7, and crucially is not present in the granules where processing occurs. PCs and PAM in the granules remain fully active at pH 6.0. Therefore:\n- PCs still generate Tyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys.\n- CPE is absent/inactive in granules, so Lys-Lys are not removed; the peptide retains a C-terminal Lys-Lys and therefore does not present a C-terminal glycine.\n- PAM requires a C-terminal glycine as substrate; because the peptide ends with Lys-Lys, PAM cannot act, so no amidation occurs.\n\nTherefore, the final secreted primary somnoregulin-related peptide is:\nTyr-Val-Leu-Gly-Met-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2345955"}, {"introduction": "Neuropeptide signaling is rarely a simple one-molecule, one-receptor event, as neurons often co-release multiple peptides derived from the same precursor.

By analyzing the results, you will learn how to distinguish between different types of receptor interactions and understand how they contribute to the complex fine-tuning of synaptic communication.", "problem": "In a specific population of neurons, a large prepropeptide is synthesized and subsequently cleaved by enzymes into three distinct molecules: a primary neuropeptide called NeuroPeptide-Alpha (NP-A), a \"spacer\" peptide called SpacerPeptide-Alpha (SP-A), and a C-terminal fragment. Upon neuronal firing, both NP-A and SP-A are co-released into the synaptic cleft along with the classical neurotransmitter, glutamate. It is known that NP-A binds to a specific presynaptic autoreceptor, AutoReceptor-Alpha (AR-A), which upon activation triggers a G-protein-mediated cascade that inhibits further glutamate release from the terminal. This serves as a negative feedback mechanism.\n\nA researcher hypothesizes that the co-released spacer peptide, SP-A, is not inert but functions as a **competitive antagonist** at the AR-A autoreceptor, thereby modulating the feedback effect of NP-A. To test this, an in-vitro experiment is performed on a preparation of these synapses. The amount of glutamate released in response to a standardized electrical stimulation is measured under five different pharmacological conditions. The results are expressed as a percentage of the glutamate released under the control condition.\n\nThe five conditions are:\n1.  **Control:** Electrical stimulation alone.\n2.  **+NP-A (std):** Stimulation in the presence of a standard concentration of NP-A.\n3.  **+SP-A:** Stimulation in the presence of SP-A at a concentration equimolar to NP-A in condition 2.\n4.  **+NP-A (std) +SP-A:** Stimulation in the presence of both the standard concentration of NP-A and the equimolar concentration of SP-A.\n5.  **+NP-A (high) +SP-A:** Stimulation in the presence of a very high, saturating concentration of NP-A, along with the same concentration of SP-A used in conditions 3 and 4.\n\nWhich of the following sets of results for relative glutamate release would provide the strongest evidence in support of the hypothesis that SP-A is a competitive antagonist at the AR-A receptor?\n\nA.\n- Condition 1: 100%\n- Condition 2: 40%\n- Condition 3: 40%\n- Condition 4: 20%\n- Condition 5: 20%\n\nB.\n- Condition 1: 100%\n- Condition 2: 40%\n- Condition 3: 100%\n- Condition 4: 40%\n- Condition 5: 40%\n\nC.\n- Condition 1: 100%\n- Condition 2: 40%\n- Condition 3: 100%\n- Condition 4: 80%\n- Condition 5: 80%\n\nD.\n- Condition 1: 100%\n- Condition 2: 40%\n- Condition 3: 100%\n- Condition 4: 80%\n- Condition 5: 45%", "solution": "We first formalize the pharmacological principles relevant to a competitive antagonist at a single receptor population. Let NP-A be the agonist with concentration $A$ and SP-A be the antagonist with concentration $B$. For a competitive antagonist acting at the same binding site as the agonist, the agonist concentration-response curve is shifted to the right without a change in maximal effect. Quantitatively, in the presence of a competitive antagonist, the agonist’s effective concentration parameter is scaled by the factor $1+\\frac{B}{K_{B}}$, where $K_B$ is the dissociation constant of the antagonist. Thus the agonist response $E$ can be written in a Hill-type form as:\n$$\nE(A,B) \\;=\\; E_{\\text{max}}\\,\\frac{A^{n}}{A^{n}+\\left(EC_{50}\\left(1+\\frac{B}{K_{B}}\\right)\\right)^{n}}\\,,\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximal effect of the agonist and $n$ is the Hill coefficient. The defining implications for a competitive antagonist are:\n- At fixed $B$, adding antagonist reduces agonist potency (increases $EC_{50}$ by $1+\\frac{B}{K_{B}}$) but does not change $E_{\\text{max}}$.\n- Consequently, for a fixed submaximal $A$, adding $B$ reduces agonist effect; however, increasing $A$ to a sufficiently high value (saturating $A$) surmounts the antagonism and restores the same maximal effect observed without antagonist.\n\nNow apply these principles to the experimental design:\n- Control (no exogenous NP-A or SP-A) defines baseline glutamate release as $1.0$ (relative units).\n- $+$NP-A (std): adding a standard concentration of the agonist should activate the autoreceptor and reduce glutamate release well below $1.0$.\n- $+$SP-A alone: a pure competitive antagonist has no intrinsic efficacy; in the absence of added agonist, it should not reduce release and might at most block any endogenous NP-A, which would not produce a reduction below control. Thus the strongest evidence would show no reduction relative to control (approximately $1.0$).\n- $+$NP-A (std) $+$SP-A: at a fixed standard $A$, adding antagonist should reduce the agonist’s inhibitory effect (i.e., shift the curve right), so the measured glutamate release should be higher (closer to control) than with NP-A alone.\n- $+$NP-A (high) $+$SP-A: with a very high, saturating $A$, the antagonism should be surmountable. Therefore the inhibition of release should approach the agonist’s maximal effect, i.e., the release should be low, similar to the effect of high agonist without antagonist, and certainly lower than with standard $A$ in the presence of antagonist.\n\nEvaluate the options against these predictions (interpreting the numbers as fractions of control: $1.0$ for control, $0.4$ for strong inhibition, $0.8$ for partial inhibition, etc.):\n- Option A: SP-A alone produces $0.4$ (same as agonist), and SP-A plus NP-A reduces release further. This implies SP-A behaves like an agonist, not an antagonist. Not supportive.\n- Option B: SP-A alone is $1.0$ (acceptable), but adding SP-A to standard NP-A leaves the response unchanged at $0.4$, and even with high NP-A plus SP-A it remains $0.4$. This shows no detectable antagonism and no surmountability pattern. Not supportive.\n- Option C: SP-A alone is $1.0$ (acceptable), and SP-A antagonizes standard NP-A, raising release from $0.4$ to $0.8$ (consistent with antagonism). However, increasing NP-A to a very high level in the continued presence of SP-A still yields $0.8$, showing the effect is not surmountable. That pattern contradicts competitive antagonism and is more consistent with noncompetitive or insurmountable antagonism. Not supportive of competitive antagonism.\n- Option D: SP-A alone is $1.0$ (acceptable), SP-A antagonizes standard NP-A (release rises from $0.4$ to $0.8$), and with very high NP-A plus the same SP-A, release falls to $0.45$, approaching the NP-A effect and showing surmountability. This matches the hallmark of competitive antagonism: rightward shift at fixed antagonist with no change in $E_{\\text{max}}$, such that sufficiently high agonist concentration overcomes the antagonist.\n\nTherefore, the strongest evidence for SP-A as a competitive antagonist at AR-A is given by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2345951"}]}
