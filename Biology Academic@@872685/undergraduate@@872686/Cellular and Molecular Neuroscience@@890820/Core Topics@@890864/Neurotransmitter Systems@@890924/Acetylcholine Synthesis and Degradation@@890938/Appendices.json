A culture of neurons is supplied with a modified form of choline where a single carbon atom within one of the three methyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom is replaced with its radioactive isotope, Carbon-14 ($^{14}\\text{C}$). This labeled choline is successfully transported into the presynaptic terminals and used for the synthesis of Acetylcholine (ACh).\n\nAssuming a single molecule of this $^{14}\\text{C}$-labeled ACh is synthesized, packaged into a synaptic vesicle, released into the synaptic cleft, and then immediately acted upon by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, what is the most probable immediate fate of the $^{14}\\text{C}$ radiolabel following this single, complete cycle of synthesis and degradation?\n\nA. Incorporated into an acetate molecule that diffuses away in the synaptic cleft.\n\nB.

Denote this as a labeled methyl, $\\mathrm{^{14}CH}_{3}$, within the choline moiety $\\mathrm{N}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{3}\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\mathrm{OH}$.\n\nAcetylcholine (ACh) synthesis in the presynaptic terminal is catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT):\n$$\n\\text{choline} + \\text{acetyl-CoA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ChAT}} \\text{acetylcholine} + \\text{CoA}.\n$$\nStructurally, the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA is transferred to the hydroxyl of choline to form an ester linkage, so the choline quaternary ammonium moiety, including its three methyl groups, is preserved unchanged in ACh. Therefore, the $^{14}\\text{C}$ label remains in the choline portion of ACh and is not incorporated into the acetyl group.\n\nUpon release, acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE):\n$$\n\\text{acetylcholine} + \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O} \\xrightarrow{\\text{AChE}} \\text{choline} + \\text{acetate}.\n$$\nEster hydrolysis cleaves the acetyl group to yield acetate and regenerates free choline. Since the label resides on a methyl carbon of the choline moiety, hydrolysis produces labeled choline and unlabeled acetate. Thus:\n- The labeled carbon is not transferred to acetate, excluding option A.\n- The labeled carbon is not part of the acetyl group that could enter mitochondrial metabolism to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, excluding option B.\n\nImmediately after hydrolysis, the fate of choline in cholinergic synapses is rapid high-affinity reuptake into the presynaptic terminal via the choline transporter (CHT1), where it is reused for ACh synthesis. Therefore, the most probable immediate fate of the $^{14}\\text{C}$ label is re-transport as part of choline into the presynaptic terminal. This excludes diffusion away into the bloodstream (option C) and rules out persistent receptor binding (option E), as ACh is rapidly cleaved and does not remain bound.\n\nHence, the correct choice is reuptake of labeled choline into the presynaptic terminal for reuse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2326245"}, {"introduction": "The recycling of choline is not a passive process; it is a finely tuned mechanism that depends on the neuron's electrochemical environment. This exercise delves into the bioenergetics of choline reuptake, a critical step for sustaining acetylcholine synthesis. By examining a hypothetical scenario where the extracellular sodium gradient is removed, you will explore the principles of secondary active transport and its importance in neurotransmitter homeostasis [@problem_id:2326225].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is studying the molecular machinery of a cholinergic synapse. It is known that after acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the synaptic cleft, it is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase into choline and acetate. The presynaptic neuron then recycles the choline for the synthesis of new ACh. This recycling is accomplished by a high-affinity choline transporter (CHT), a protein located on the presynaptic membrane. The CHT is a symporter that utilizes the electrochemical gradient of sodium ions ($Na^+$) to move choline from the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic terminal. Specifically, the transport of one molecule of choline is coupled to the transport of two $Na^+$ ions into the neuron.\n\nIn an experiment, this synapse is bathed in an artificial extracellular fluid that is identical to physiological fluid except that all sodium chloride ($NaCl$) has been replaced by lithium chloride ($LiCl$). Assume that lithium ions ($Li^+$) are not transported by the CHT and that the presynaptic neuron continues to fire, releasing its pre-existing stores of ACh.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this experimental condition on the acetylcholine life cycle?\n\nA. The rate of acetylcholine synthesis will increase to compensate for the altered ionic environment.\n\nB. Choline reuptake will be inhibited, leading to a decreased rate of acetylcholine synthesis.\n\nC. The activity of the enzyme Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT), which synthesizes acetylcholine, will be directly inhibited by the absence of extracellular sodium.\n\nD. Acetylcholine will accumulate to high levels in the synaptic cleft because its degradation is blocked.\n\nE. The high-affinity choline transporter will reverse its direction, pumping choline out of the presynaptic terminal.", "solution": "The relevant biochemical and transport processes are:\n1) Acetylcholine hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase:\n$$ACh \\xrightarrow{\\text{AChE}} \\text{choline} + \\text{acetate}$$\n2) Acetylcholine synthesis by choline acetyltransferase:\n$$\\text{choline} + \\text{acetyl-CoA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ChAT}} ACh + \\text{CoA}$$\n3) High-affinity choline uptake by the presynaptic CHT, which is a sodium-coupled symporter with the stoichiometry:\n$$\\text{choline}_{\\text{out}} + 2\\,\\text{Na}^{+}_{\\text{out}} \\to \\text{choline}_{\\text{in}} + 2\\,\\text{Na}^{+}_{\\text{in}}$$\n\nPrinciple: A secondary active symporter requires binding of the coupled ion on the appropriate side and a favorable electrochemical gradient to drive transport. If $Na^{+}$ is replaced extracellularly by $Li^{+}$, and $Li^{+}$ is not transported by CHT, then the required $Na^{+}$ binding and the inward $Na^{+}$ electrochemical gradient are absent. Therefore, CHT-mediated choline uptake is effectively blocked.\n\nUnder the experimental condition (all extracellular $NaCl$ replaced by $LiCl$, with $Li^{+}$ not a substrate for CHT):\n- $Na^{+}_{\\text{out}}$ is effectively absent, so $2\\,Na^{+}_{\\text{out}}$ cannot bind to CHT. The symport cycle cannot proceed, so choline reuptake from the cleft is inhibited.\n- ACh release continues transiently from pre-existing vesicular stores, and AChE remains active; ACh degradation is not $Na^{+}$-dependent. Thus, ACh will not accumulate; it will be hydrolyzed to choline and acetate, but the produced choline will not be efficiently reclaimed and will be lost from the cleft by diffusion.\n- The rate of ACh synthesis in the terminal depends critically on intracellular choline availability. With CHT blocked, intracellular choline supply decreases, making choline availability rate-limiting for ChAT. ChAT itself is not directly inhibited by the absence of extracellular $Na^{+}$; rather, its substrate becomes scarce.\n- Without $Na^{+}$ binding and gradient, CHT will not reverse to export choline; lack of the coupled ion precludes transporter cycling in either direction.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect. There is no compensatory increase in synthesis; instead, synthesis falls due to substrate (choline) scarcity.\n- B: Correct. Choline reuptake is inhibited, which decreases the rate of ACh synthesis by limiting choline availability.\n- C: Incorrect. ChAT activity is not directly inhibited by the absence of extracellular $Na^{+}$; it is limited indirectly by reduced choline.\n- D: Incorrect. AChE continues to hydrolyze ACh; degradation is not blocked, so ACh will not accumulate.\n- E: Incorrect. The CHT does not reverse to pump choline out in the absence of extracellular $Na^{+}$; without $Na^{+}$ binding, transport ceases rather than reverses.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is inhibited choline reuptake leading to decreased ACh synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2326225"}, {"introduction": "Once synthesized, acetylcholine must be concentrated into synaptic vesicles at levels far exceeding its concentration in the cytoplasm. This problem moves from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding of neurotransmitter packaging, challenging you to apply biophysical principles to the process.

This process is mediated by the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), which operates as an antiporter. The energy for this transport is provided by a proton electrochemical gradient maintained by a V-type H+-ATPase (proton pump) in the vesicle membrane. This pump hydrolyzes ATP to actively transport protons ($H^{+}$) into the vesicle, creating both a pH gradient and an electrical potential difference across the vesicular membrane. The VAChT couples the transport of one positively charged acetylcholine molecule ($\\text{ACh}^{+}$) into the vesicle with the export of two protons ($2 H^{+}$) out of the vesicle.\n\nUnder normal physiological conditions at a temperature of 37.0 °C, a steady state is reached where the intra-vesicular pH is 5.5, while the cytosolic pH is 7.4.

Now, consider the application of a novel experimental drug that completely and specifically inhibits the V-type H+-ATPase proton pump. After the application of this drug, the system is allowed to reach a new steady state where the proton gradient and the membrane potential across the vesicle have fully dissipated (i.e., the pH and electrical potential differences across the membrane become zero).\n\nAssuming the concentration of acetylcholine in the cytosol remains constant throughout the experiment, calculate the ratio of the steady-state intra-vesicular acetylcholine concentration *after* the inhibitor's action to the concentration *before* the inhibitor was added.\n\nUse the following constants:\nFaraday constant, $F = 96,485 \\text{ C/mol}$\nIdeal gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J/(mol}\\cdot\\text{K)}$\n\nExpress your answer as a single real number rounded to two significant figures.
