Because $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ carries negative charge, an outward positive current corresponds to inward movement of $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions.

The ionic solutions on either side of the membrane are formulated such that the Nernst potential for chloride ions ($E_{Cl}$) is -75 mV.\n\nWhen glycine is applied to the extracellular side of the membrane patch, the channel opens, allowing chloride ions to flow. A single, discrete channel opening event is observed to produce a steady current. The magnitude of this current is measured to be 0.60 pA. By convention in electrophysiology, an inward flow of positive charge (or an outward flow of negative charge) is defined as a positive current, and an outward flow of positive charge (or an inward flow of negative charge) is defined as a negative current.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the single-channel conductance ($\\gamma_{Cl}$) for this glycine receptor.
