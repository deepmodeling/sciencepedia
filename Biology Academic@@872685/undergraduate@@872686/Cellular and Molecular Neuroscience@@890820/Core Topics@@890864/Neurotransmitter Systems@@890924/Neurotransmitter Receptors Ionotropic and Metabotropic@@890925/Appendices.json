Let's denote the number of G-proteins activated by a single receptor as $N_G$. Each of these activated G-proteins then diffuses along the cell membrane and activates one molecule of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Once activated, each adenylyl cyclase molecule continuously produces Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), a crucial second messenger, at a constant rate $R$.\n\nAssume that once the neurotransmitter binds, the receptor and all subsequently activated G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase molecules remain active for a fixed period of time $T$.
