The postsynaptic neuron has a resting membrane potential of -70 mV and an action potential threshold of -55 mV. Under normal conditions, a single stimulus to the presynaptic neuron reliably causes an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane to -60 mV.\n\nThe researcher then introduces a novel experimental drug, \"Vesiculosin,\" to the culture medium. Subsequent analysis reveals that Vesiculosin is a highly specific and potent antagonist of the Vesicular Glutamate Transporters (VGluTs) located on the membrane of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. After allowing sufficient time for the drug to take effect, the researcher applies the same single stimulus to the presynaptic neuron.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most likely immediate postsynaptic membrane potential measurement following the presynaptic stimulus in the presence of Vesiculosin?\n\nA.

Under normal conditions, a presynaptic action potential triggers vesicle fusion, releasing glutamate into the synaptic cleft. Postsynaptic AMPA receptors increase their open probability, producing a synaptic conductance $g_{\\text{syn}}$ with reversal potential $E_{\\text{rev}}$ near the cation reversal (approximately around zero for mixed Na and K). The synaptic current is\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}}=g_{\\text{syn}}\\left(V_{m}-E_{\\text{rev}}\\right),\n$$\nand the membrane response obeys Ohm’s law\n$$\n\\Delta V = R_{m} I_{\\text{syn}},\n$$\nso an excitatory input at a resting membrane potential that is negative relative to $E_{\\text{rev}}$ produces a depolarizing $\\Delta V>0$. This explains the observed normal EPSP that shifts the membrane from the resting value (minus 70 mV) to approximately minus 60 mV.\n\nVesiculosin is a highly specific and potent antagonist of vesicular glutamate transporters. The relevant physical principle is that glutamate is loaded into synaptic vesicles by VGluTs using the proton electrochemical gradient; blockade of VGluTs prevents vesicular glutamate accumulation. After sufficient time for the drug to take effect, previously filled vesicles are depleted by ongoing turnover, leaving newly cycling vesicles effectively empty of glutamate. Upon a presynaptic stimulus, exocytosis still occurs, but the cleft glutamate concentration satisfies\n$$\n[\\text{Glu}]_{\\text{cleft}} \\approx 0,\n$$\nso the postsynaptic receptor open probability $P_{\\text{o}}([\\text{Glu}])$ is approximately zero and therefore\n$$\ng_{\\text{syn}} = g_{\\text{max}} P_{\\text{o}} \\approx 0.\n$$\nIt follows that\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}}=g_{\\text{syn}}\\left(V_{m}-E_{\\text{rev}}\\right)\\approx 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta V = R_{m} I_{\\text{syn}} \\approx 0.\n$$\nTherefore, the postsynaptic membrane potential shows no significant deviation from the resting potential (remains near minus 70 mV) following the presynaptic stimulus.\n\nOptions implying hyperpolarization (A), reaching threshold (B), or sustained large depolarization (D) contradict the absence of glutamate. A smaller EPSP (E) would require partial vesicular filling; however, given the drug is highly potent and sufficient time has been allowed for vesicle turnover, the most likely immediate effect is no measurable EPSP.

This exercise focuses on the AMPA receptor, the workhorse for fast excitatory signaling in the brain. Through a hypothetical scenario involving a competitive antagonist [@problem_id:2337535], you will explore the direct link between receptor availability and the magnitude of the resulting excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), a core principle of synaptic physiology.", "problem": "In the central nervous system, glutamate serves as the primary excitatory neurotransmitter. During synaptic transmission at a typical excitatory synapse, the release of glutamate from the presynaptic terminal leads to its binding to postsynaptic receptors. One crucial class of these receptors is the Alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid (AMPA) receptor, which is an ionotropic receptor. Upon binding glutamate, the AMPA receptor channel opens, allowing an influx of positively charged sodium ions (Na⁺) into the postsynaptic neuron. This influx causes a localized, transient depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, known as an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP).\n\nA neuroscientist is studying a single glutamatergic synapse in a laboratory setting. They apply a novel drug that acts as a competitive antagonist specifically for AMPA receptors. This means the drug binds to the same site on the AMPA receptor as glutamate but does not cause the ion channel to open, effectively blocking glutamate from binding. After the application of this antagonist, a single action potential is triggered in the presynaptic neuron, causing a standard amount of glutamate to be released.\n\nHow would the application of this competitive antagonist affect the magnitude of the resulting EPSP in the postsynaptic neuron, compared to the EPSP generated without the drug?\n\nA. The EPSP magnitude will increase.\n\nB. The EPSP magnitude will decrease.\n\nC. The EPSP will be converted into an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\n\nD. The EPSP magnitude will be unchanged, but the duration of the EPSP will be significantly shorter.\n\nE. The EPSP will be completely unaffected because the amount of glutamate released from the presynaptic terminal does not change.", "solution": "The AMPA receptor is an ionotropic ligand-gated channel whose opening probability depends on agonist (glutamate) binding. The postsynaptic current mediated by AMPA receptors can be written as\n$$\nI_{\\text{AMPA}} = g_{\\text{AMPA}}(V - E_{\\text{rev}}),\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\text{AMPA}}$ is the total AMPA conductance, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{\\text{rev}}$ is the AMPA reversal potential. The conductance can be expressed as\n$$\ng_{\\text{AMPA}} = N_{\\text{open}} \\gamma,\n$$\nwith $\\gamma$ the single-channel conductance and $N_{\\text{open}}$ the number of open receptors, which is proportional to the fraction of receptors occupied by glutamate.\n\nWith a competitive antagonist $I$ at the same binding site, the fractional occupancy of receptors by agonist $A$ (glutamate) at fixed $[A]$ is reduced according to the standard competitive binding relation\n$$\n\\theta_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}},\n$$\nwhere $K_{A}$ and $K_{I}$ are the equilibrium dissociation constants for agonist and antagonist, respectively. Compared to the no-antagonist case\n$$\n\\theta_{A}^{(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}}},\n$$\nthe presence of antagonist increases the denominator by $\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}$, yielding $\\theta_{A} < \\theta_{A}^{(0)}$ for any $[I] > 0$. Therefore,\n$$\nN_{\\text{open}} \\propto \\theta_{A} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad g_{\\text{AMPA}} \\text{ decreases} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad |I_{\\text{AMPA}}| \\text{ decreases}.\n$$\nBecause the EPSP amplitude depends on the synaptic current via the membrane impedance, the reduced AMPA-mediated current yields a smaller depolarization:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{EPSP}} \\propto I_{\\text{AMPA}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{EPSP magnitude decreases.}\n$$\nThe antagonist does not convert the response to an IPSP, as that would require opening inhibitory conductances with reversal potentials more negative than rest (e.g., chloride or potassium), not merely blocking an excitatory conductance. The time course of the EPSP is primarily governed by glutamate transient and receptor/channel kinetics; a competitive antagonist at fixed glutamate reduces the number of openings rather than accelerating channel closing, so there is no reason to expect the duration to be significantly shorter independent of amplitude scaling. Although the amount of glutamate released is unchanged, the postsynaptic effect depends on receptor occupancy and conductance, which are reduced by competition at the binding site. Therefore, the EPSP magnitude will decrease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2337535"}, {"introduction": "Glutamatergic signaling is not just about fast transmission; it involves sophisticated mechanisms for synaptic modification, largely orchestrated by the NMDA receptor. This final practice delves into the unique biophysical properties of this receptor, which functions as a molecular coincidence detector. By analyzing the flow of different ions through the NMDA channel under specific voltage conditions [@problem_id:2337525], you will uncover the elegant mechanism that underlies its crucial role in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity.", "problem": "The N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a crucial ionotropic receptor for the neurotransmitter glutamate and plays a vital role in synaptic plasticity. A key characteristic of the NMDA receptor is that it is permeable to several cations, including Sodium ($Na^+$), Potassium ($K^+$), and Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$). Furthermore, its function is regulated by a voltage-dependent block from extracellular Magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$) ions, which obstruct the channel pore at hyperpolarized or resting membrane potentials but are expelled upon sufficient depolarization.\n\nConsider a typical postsynaptic neuron under experimental conditions.

The $Mg^{2+}$ block is relieved, and there is a net influx of $Na^+$ and a net efflux of $K^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nD. Because the membrane potential is at the receptor's reversal potential, there is no net flow of any individual ion species through the channel.\n\nE. The $Mg^{2+}$ block is relieved, and there is a net influx of $Na^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$, and a net efflux of $K^+$.", "solution": "We apply two principles:\n\n1) Voltage-dependent Mg^{2+} block of NMDA receptors: hyperpolarization favors Mg^{2+} occupancy of the pore, while depolarization relieves the block. At $V_{m}=0$ mV, the membrane is sufficiently depolarized that the Mg^{2+} block is relieved, allowing permeant ions to flow.\n\n2) Direction of ion flux through an open channel follows the sign of the driving force $V_{m}-E_{X}$ for a cation $X$, with $I_{X}\\propto g_{X}(V_{m}-E_{X})$. If $V_{m}-E_{X}<0$, there is net influx (inward movement of positive charge). If $V_{m}-E_{X}>0$, there is net efflux (outward movement of positive charge).\n\nEvaluate the driving force for each permeant ion at $V_{m}=0$ mV using the given equilibrium potentials:\n- Sodium: $V_{m}-E_{Na}=0-(+62\\ \\text{mV})=-62\\ \\text{mV} < 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{net influx of } Na^{+}$.\n- Potassium: $V_{m}-E_{K}=0-(-90\\ \\text{mV})=+90\\ \\text{mV} > 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{net efflux of } K^{+}$.\n- Calcium: $V_{m}-E_{Ca}=0-(+125\\ \\text{mV})=-125\\ \\text{mV} < 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{net influx of } Ca^{2+}$.\n\nRegarding the distractor that invokes reversal potential: even if the channel’s reversal potential were near $0$ mV, the condition for reversal is $\\sum_{X}I_{X}=0$, not $I_{X}=0$ for each ion. Individual ionic fluxes can be nonzero and cancel in the sum. Therefore, the statement that there is no net flow of any individual ion at $0$ mV is incorrect.\n\nThus, with Mg^{2+} block relieved at $0$ mV, the correct pattern is $Na^{+}$ influx, $Ca^{2+}$ influx, and $K^{+}$ efflux.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2337525"}]}
