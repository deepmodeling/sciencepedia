This exercise challenges you to think like a molecular biologist and design a definitive in vitro experiment to prove that synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 are the minimal set of proteins required for membrane fusion. Mastering the logic of sufficiency and necessity through controlled experiments is a cornerstone of building and testing any hypothesis in molecular science. [@problem_id:2353634]", "problem": "A molecular neuroscientist aims to test the hypothesis that the proteins synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 are the minimal set of components required to mediate membrane fusion. The experimental system uses two populations of artificial lipid vesicles, called liposomes.\n\nThe first population, \"v-liposomes,\" is designed to mimic synaptic vesicles. The second population, \"t-liposomes,\" is designed to mimic the target presynaptic plasma membrane. The proteins involved are the vesicle-associated Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (v-SNARE) synaptobrevin, and the target-associated SNAREs (t-SNAREs) syntaxin and SNAP-25.\n\nTo detect fusion, a lipid-mixing assay based on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) will be used. In this assay, the v-liposomes are prepared with a pair of fluorescent lipid dyes, a donor and an acceptor, incorporated into their membrane at a high concentration. At this concentration, the donor's fluorescence is \"quenched\" by the nearby acceptor. If a labeled v-liposome fuses with an unlabeled t-liposome, the dyes spread out over the larger membrane area. This dilution increases the average distance between donor and acceptor molecules, leading to a decrease in quenching (dequenching) and a measurable increase in the donor's fluorescence signal.\n\nWhich of the following experimental plans provides the most rigorous and conclusive test of the hypothesis that synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 are the minimal machinery for fusion?\n\nA. Prepare v-liposomes containing synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25. Prepare t-liposomes with no proteins. Mix the two populations and measure for an increase in donor fluorescence.\n\nB. Prepare FRET-labeled v-liposomes containing synaptobrevin. Prepare unlabeled t-liposomes containing syntaxin. Mix the two populations and measure for an increase in donor fluorescence. This is repeated in a separate experiment where the t-liposomes contain SNAP-25 instead of syntaxin.\n\nC. Prepare FRET-labeled v-liposomes containing synaptobrevin. Prepare unlabeled t-liposomes containing both syntaxin and SNAP-25. Mix the two populations and measure for an increase in donor fluorescence.\n\nD. This plan requires four separate experiments:\n1.  (Positive Control): Mix FRET-labeled v-liposomes containing synaptobrevin with unlabeled t-liposomes containing both syntaxin and SNAP-25.\n2.  (Negative Control 1): Mix FRET-labeled v-liposomes lacking any protein with unlabeled t-liposomes containing both syntaxin and SNAP-25.\n3.  (Negative Control 2): Mix FRET-labeled v-liposomes containing synaptobrevin with unlabeled t-liposomes containing only syntaxin (omitting SNAP-25).\n4.  (Negative Control 3): Mix FRET-labeled v-liposomes containing synaptobrevin with unlabeled t-liposomes containing only SNAP-25 (omitting syntaxin).\nThe hypothesis is supported if an increase in donor fluorescence is observed only in experiment 1.", "solution": "The hypothesis states that synaptobrevin (v-SNARE), syntaxin, and SNAP-25 (t-SNAREs) together constitute the minimal machinery for membrane fusion. To test a minimal set rigorously, the experiment must simultaneously establish sufficiency and necessity under the correct topology. Sufficiency requires that, in the absence of other proteins, the presence of all three SNAREs in their physiological compartments yields a fusion-dependent increase in donor fluorescence in the FRET lipid-mixing assay. Necessity requires that removal of any one component from the set $\\{\\mathrm{synaptobrevin}, \\mathrm{syntaxin}, \\mathrm{SNAP\\text{-}25}\\}$ abolishes the fusion signal. The FRET assay reads out lipid mixing as dequenching (increased donor fluorescence) when labeled v-liposomes fuse with unlabeled t-liposomes, diluting donor and acceptor dyes across the fused membrane.\n\nOption A places synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 together on the v-liposomes while t-liposomes lack proteins. This violates the required topology for a trans-SNARE interaction because the t-SNAREs are not on the target membrane. Any observed dequenching could be confounded by cis-SNARE interactions on the same membrane or homotypic v-liposome fusion, and the design does not test necessity of individual components. Therefore, A cannot provide a conclusive test of the minimal set.\n\nOption B tests synaptobrevin with either syntaxin alone or SNAP-25 alone in separate experiments. Because the canonical trans-SNARE complex requires both syntaxin and SNAP-25 to form the functional t-SNARE, these separate pairings are expected to be nonfunctional; moreover, there is no experiment including both t-SNAREs together to test sufficiency, and no protein-free negative control to establish baseline. Thus, B cannot establish either sufficiency or necessity of the complete set.\n\nOption C places synaptobrevin on v-liposomes and both syntaxin and SNAP-25 on t-liposomes, which matches the physiological topology and can test sufficiency if an increase in donor fluorescence is observed. However, in the absence of negative controls, any dequenching could be due to nonspecific lipid mixing, aggregation, or dye artifacts. It also does not test the necessity of each individual t-SNARE component. Therefore, C is not the most rigorous or conclusive.\n\nOption D explicitly tests sufficiency and necessity with proper controls. Experiment 1 (positive control) assembles the full trans-SNARE pairing with synaptobrevin on v-liposomes and syntaxin plus SNAP-25 on t-liposomes, testing sufficiency. Experiment 2 (negative control 1) omits all protein from v-liposomes while retaining both t-SNAREs on t-liposomes, establishing that protein-free liposomes do not produce dequenching. Experiments 3 and 4 (negative controls 2 and 3) omit syntaxin or SNAP-25, respectively, from t-liposomes while keeping synaptobrevin on v-liposomes, directly testing the necessity of each t-SNARE subunit. The hypothesis is supported only if increased donor fluorescence occurs exclusively in experiment 1, satisfying both sufficiency (full set present leads to fusion-dependent dequenching) and necessity (removal of any single component abolishes the signal). This design also preserves the correct membrane topology for trans-SNARE pairing and rules out alternative explanations for dequenching.\n\nTherefore, the most rigorous and conclusive plan is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2353634"}, {"introduction": "Protein function is exquisitely dependent on its three-dimensional structure, often down to the level of single atoms. The SNARE complex is a perfect example, with a highly conserved 'ionic layer' at its core that is critical for stability and function. In this problem, you will predict the functional consequences of a single amino acid mutation in this layer, connecting fundamental principles of protein chemistry to the efficiency of neurotransmitter release. [@problem_id:2353610]", "problem": "The process of neurotransmitter release at a synapse is critically dependent on the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. This fusion is driven by the assembly of the SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor) complex. The core of this complex is an exceptionally stable four-helix bundle formed by proteins from both the vesicle and the target membrane: one helix from synaptobrevin (on the vesicle), one from syntaxin-1 (on the target membrane), and two from SNAP-25 (on the target membrane).\n\nA key structural feature at the center of this four-helix bundle is the \"ionic zero layer\". In a functional neuronal SNARE complex, this layer is composed of the side chains of four specific amino acids, one contributed by each helix. Synaptobrevin contributes a positively charged arginine (R) residue, while syntaxin-1 and the two helices of SNAP-25 each contribute a polar, uncharged glutamine (Q) residue. This $R-Q_3$ arrangement (one Arginine, three Glutamines) is highly conserved and is believed to be essential for the stability and function of the complex, with the R residue's positive charge stabilizing the electronegative carbonyls of the Q residues' side chains.\n\nImagine a molecular biology experiment in which the gene for synaptobrevin is modified. This site-directed mutagenesis results in the substitution of the critical arginine residue in the ionic layer with a glutamine residue (an R-to-Q mutation). The mutated synaptobrevin protein is otherwise identical to the wild-type and is correctly localized to synaptic vesicles.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately predicts the primary consequence of this R-to-Q mutation on SNARE-mediated membrane fusion?\n\nA. Fusion becomes significantly faster and more efficient, as the resulting symmetric $Q_4$ layer (four glutamines) can pack more tightly, releasing more energy upon assembly.\n\nB. There is no significant change in fusion dynamics, because glutamine is also a polar amino acid and can form a functionally redundant set of hydrogen bonds within the layer.\n\nC. The SNARE complex can no longer assemble even partially, and the synaptic vesicles fail to dock at the presynaptic membrane.\n\nD. The rate of fusion is substantially reduced because the loss of the stabilizing electrostatic interactions provided by the arginine's positive charge makes the fully-assembled SNARE complex less stable, diminishing its ability to overcome the energy barrier of membrane fusion.\n\nE. The specificity of fusion is lost, causing synaptic vesicles to fuse indiscriminately with other organelles within the presynaptic terminal, such as mitochondria.", "solution": "We first identify the structural principle governing SNARE complex stability: the four-helix bundle contains an ionic zero layer comprising one positively charged arginine (R) from synaptobrevin and three glutamines (Q) from syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25. The R side chain provides a localized positive charge that stabilizes the polar, electronegative amide carbonyl groups of the Q residues through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen-bonding networks. This $R-Q_3$ arrangement is conserved because it optimally balances electrostatics in the hydrophobic core of the bundle and maximizes the enthalpic gain upon zippering of the SNARE complex.\n\nThe mutation replaces the synaptobrevin R with Q, yielding a $Q_4$ layer. This substitution removes the only positive charge at the zero layer. Consequently, the central electrostatic stabilization is lost and replaced by a network of polar interactions among Q side chains that lacks the favorable cation-based stabilization. Therefore, the enthalpic contribution of the zero layer to the assembled complex is reduced.\n\nThermodynamically, let the free energy change of SNARE zippering for wild type be $\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}^{\\text{WT}}$ and for the mutant be $\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}^{\\text{Q4}}$. Loss of the arginine’s positive charge makes the assembled state less stable, so $\\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}^{\\text{Q4}} > \\Delta G_{\\text{zip}}^{\\text{WT}}$ (less negative, i.e., weaker binding). The mechanical work available from zippering to help overcome the membrane fusion barrier is reduced. If the intrinsic fusion activation barrier without SNARE work is $\\Delta G_{0}^{\\ddagger}$ and the zippering performs work $W_{\\text{zip}}$ to lower this barrier, then the effective barrier is $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}=\\Delta G_{0}^{\\ddagger}-W_{\\text{zip}}$. The reaction rate scales as $r \\propto \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$. With the mutation, $W_{\\text{zip}}$ decreases, so $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ increases and $r$ decreases:\n$$\nW_{\\text{zip}}^{\\text{Q4}} < W_{\\text{zip}}^{\\text{WT}} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{Q4}} > \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{WT}} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; r_{\\text{Q4}} < r_{\\text{WT}}.\n$$\n\nKinetically and structurally, the SNARE bundle is not expected to fail to assemble entirely. The remaining heptad-repeat hydrophobic packing and multiple hydrogen bonds along the helices still support partial and even full assembly, albeit with reduced stability near the core. Vesicle docking, which can occur with partially assembled SNAREs and additional tethering factors, should still be possible. Thus, complete loss of assembly and docking is unlikely. Likewise, enhanced fusion efficiency is inconsistent with the loss of a key stabilizing electrostatic feature, and loss of organelle specificity is not predicted by a single zero-layer substitution.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is a substantial reduction in fusion rate due to diminished stability and driving force of the fully assembled SNARE complex, impairing its ability to overcome the energy barrier of membrane fusion.
