This practice introduces a core technique in neuroanatomy: calculating linear spine density. By working through this exercise, you will learn how to transform a direct observation from a micrograph into a meaningful metric that reflects a neuron's capacity for receiving synaptic inputs [@problem_id:2333651].", "problem": "In a neuroscience laboratory, a student is examining a micrograph of a Golgi-stained pyramidal neuron from the brain's hippocampus to study synaptic architecture. The student focuses on a specific dendritic segment to quantify its potential for receiving synaptic inputs. Dendritic spines are small, mushroom-shaped protrusions from a neuron's dendrite that typically receive input from a single axon terminal. The number of spines per unit length of dendrite, known as the linear spine density, is a key morphological parameter related to synaptic strength and learning.\n\nThe student measures a section of a dendrite and finds its length to be 18 micrometers ($\\mu$m). Along this specific segment, the student carefully counts a total of 31 distinct dendritic spines.\n\nCalculate the linear spine density for this observed dendritic segment. Express your answer in units of spines per micrometer, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The linear spine density is defined as the number of spines per unit length. Let $N$ be the number of spines and $L$ be the dendritic length. Then the density $\\lambda$ is\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{N}{L}.\n$$\nGiven $N=31$ spines and $L=18$ micrometers, we have\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{31}{18}\\ \\text{spines per micrometer}.\n$$\nCompute and round to two significant figures:\n$$\n\\frac{31}{18}\\approx 1.7\\ \\text{spines per micrometer}.\n$$\nThus, the linear spine density is $1.7$ in the requested units when rounded to two significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.7}$$", "id": "2333651"}, {"introduction": "Dendritic spines are not static structures; they are highly dynamic, constantly changing shape in a process central to learning and memory. This motility is driven by a complex internal scaffolding known as the actin cytoskeleton. This problem presents a thought experiment to help you connect the function of this molecular machinery to the observable behavior of the spine, clarifying how blocking a key process like actin polymerization impacts structural plasticity [@problem_id:2333657].", "problem": "In cellular neuroscience, dendritic spines are small, dynamic protrusions on a neuron's dendrites that form the postsynaptic component of most excitatory synapses. The shape, size, and number of these spines can change over time, a phenomenon known as structural plasticity, which is believed to be a cellular basis for learning and memory. This motility and structural integrity of dendritic spines are primarily maintained by an internal cytoskeleton composed of a dense network of actin filaments. The dynamic nature of this network relies on the continuous and balanced processes of actin polymerization (the assembly of actin monomers into filaments) and depolymerization (the disassembly of filaments).\n\nA researcher applies a newly developed drug, \"Inhibitin-A,\" to a cultured neuron. The specific mechanism of Inhibitin-A is to block actin polymerization by capping the growing ends of actin filaments, thus preventing the addition of new actin monomers. The drug does not, however, accelerate the breakdown of existing filaments. Based on this mechanism, what is the most likely and immediate effect on the motility of the neuron's dendritic spines?\n\nA. Spine motility will significantly increase, causing the spines to rapidly change shape and extend.\nB. Spine motility will be largely unaffected, as it is primarily controlled by the influx of calcium ions, not the cytoskeleton.\nC. The spines will rigidly lock into their current shape, and all motility will cease.\nD. The spines will immediately and completely retract into the dendritic shaft.\nE. Spine motility will decrease, as the capacity for dynamic structural remodeling is impaired.", "solution": "Dendritic spine motility is driven by the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, specifically by the balance between actin polymerization at barbed ends that produces protrusive forces and depolymerization that recycles actin monomers. Protrusion and shape fluctuations require ongoing polymerization to generate new filament length and mechanical pushing against the membrane, while depolymerization alone tends to reduce filament length and undermine structure.\n\nThe drug Inhibitin-A caps the growing (barbed) ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing further addition of actin monomers. By the problem’s stipulation, it does not accelerate filament breakdown, so depolymerization proceeds at its baseline rate. Consequently, the rate of polymerization effectively drops toward zero while depolymerization continues. This abolishes treadmilling and eliminates protrusive activity, immediately impairing the capacity for dynamic structural remodeling. Because depolymerization is not blocked, the spines will not rigidly lock; because breakdown is not accelerated, there will not be an immediate and complete retraction. Calcium signaling is not sufficient to maintain motility in the absence of actin polymerization because the cytoskeletal machinery is the direct effector of shape changes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and immediate effect is a decrease in spine motility due to the loss of actin-driven protrusive dynamics and reduced cytoskeletal remodeling, making option E correct and the alternatives incorrect: A is incompatible with blocked polymerization; B ignores the essential role of actin dynamics; C is incorrect because depolymerization persists; D overstates the acute effect, which would be gradual rather than immediate and complete.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2333657"}, {"introduction": "The specific architecture of synapses—typically one excitatory synapse per spine—is a deliberate design feature, not an accident. This practice explores the profound functional reason for this arrangement: ensuring the precision of information storage. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario where this rule is broken, you will uncover why the biochemical compartmentalization provided by individual spines is essential for the synapse-specific nature of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), the cellular basis of memory [@problem_id:2333660].", "problem": "In the mammalian brain, the precision of information storage is thought to rely on the compartmentalization of biochemical signals within individual dendritic spines. Consider a hypothetical scenario involving a single, large, mature \"mushroom\" dendritic spine on a pyramidal neuron. This spine, contrary to typical morphology, has developed a single, large, continuous Postsynaptic Density (PSD) that receives glutamatergic input from two functionally distinct and independent presynaptic terminals, which we will call Terminal A and Terminal B. Terminal A provides a strong, well-established input pathway that is frequently active. Terminal B provides a weak input pathway that is only intermittently active. The spine head constitutes a single, shared cytoplasmic volume for all postsynaptic components associated with both terminals. Assume that the induction of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a primary mechanism for memory storage, requires a large, transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration within the spine.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this unusual synaptic arrangement for plasticity and information processing?\n\nA. The spine will effectively integrate the inputs, allowing the neuron to form a single, stable \"composite\" memory that is an average of the information from Terminal A and Terminal B.\nB. Over time, the spine will develop an internal physical barrier, such as a derivative of the spine apparatus, to biochemically isolate the two synaptic sites and restore input specificity.\nC. Synaptic competition will dominate, causing the signals from the strong Terminal A to permanently silence or eliminate the synapse from the weak Terminal B through heterosynaptic depression.\nD. It would compromise the synapse-specific nature of LTP, as strong activation of input A could lead to non-associative potentiation of the neighboring, inactive input B due to calcium spillover within the shared spine volume.\nE. This arrangement would enhance the computational power of the neuron by allowing the spine to act as a logical AND-gate, where LTP only occurs if both Terminal A and Terminal B are active simultaneously.", "solution": "We begin by stating the induction rule for long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses: LTP requires a large, transient rise in the postsynaptic spine calcium concentration. Denote the spine calcium concentration by $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{spine}}(t)$ and the LTP threshold by $\\theta_{\\text{LTP}}$. A necessary condition for LTP induction can be written schematically as\n$$\n[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{spine}}(t) > \\theta_{\\text{LTP}} \\quad \\text{for sufficient duration.}\n$$\nIn typical cortical or hippocampal pyramidal neurons, synapse specificity of plasticity is maintained because each glutamatergic synapse is usually located on its own dendritic spine, and the spine head acts as a biochemical compartment. In that case, calcium entering through $N$-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels and voltage-gated calcium channels during activity at one synapse produces an elevation $\\Delta [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ that is restricted to that spine. The spatial restriction preserves synapse-specific LTP: only the active synapse’s spine crosses $\\theta_{\\text{LTP}}$.\n\nIn the hypothetical scenario, two independent presynaptic terminals (Terminal A and Terminal B) converge onto a single, large spine head with a single, continuous postsynaptic density and a shared cytoplasmic volume. Because the spine head constitutes a single well-mixed compartment, calcium dynamics within the head obey rapid diffusion relative to the biochemical signaling timescale, i.e.,\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{diff}} \\ll \\tau_{\\text{signaling}},\n$$\nso that a strong influx of calcium anywhere in the head leads to an elevation of $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{spine}}(t)$ throughout the entire spine volume. Thus, strong activation of Terminal A that opens its $N$-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and possibly voltage-gated calcium channels will produce a global rise\n$$\n[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{spine}}(t) \\to [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{spine}}(t) + \\Delta [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{A},\n$$\nwhich is shared by all postsynaptic components embedded in the continuous postsynaptic density, including those aligned with Terminal B.\n\nIf $\\Delta [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{A}$ is sufficiently large to exceed $\\theta_{\\text{LTP}}$, then calcium-dependent effectors such as CaMKII, Ras-ERK, and associated scaffolding and trafficking machinery can be activated throughout the spine head. Because the postsynaptic density is continuous, the sites aligned with Terminal B are exposed to the same biochemical state (elevated $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$, activated kinases, and plasticity-related protein availability). This permits potentiation-related processes, such as AMPA receptor insertion and changes in receptor conductance or number, to occur at the Terminal B-aligned region even if Terminal B did not release glutamate during that induction epoch. This constitutes non-associative potentiation at B driven by A’s activity, thereby compromising synapse-specificity.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because plasticity does not average information; rather, the shared calcium and signaling lead to crosstalk, not a stable composite code.\n- Option B is speculative and not the primary, necessary consequence; while structural compartmentalization mechanisms exist, the question asks for the primary consequence of the given arrangement, which follows from shared calcium dynamics.\n- Option C posits heterosynaptic depression of the weak input by the strong input. Although heterosynaptic interactions can occur, in a shared spine the immediate and dominant effect of a strong calcium transient is to enable calcium-dependent potentiation processes across the shared postsynaptic density, not selective silencing of the weak input.\n- Option D directly captures the core biophysical implication: the shared cytoplasmic volume and continuous postsynaptic density allow calcium and its downstream signals to spread, so strong activation of A can non-associatively potentiate B and thus undermine synapse-specific LTP.\n- Option E (AND-gate behavior) would require that both inputs be active to exceed $\\theta_{\\text{LTP}}$, but the premise states that Terminal A alone is strong and frequently active, so A alone can drive $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{spine}}$ above threshold, defeating an AND requirement and instead enabling crosstalk.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the primary consequence is the loss of synapse-specificity due to calcium spillover within the shared spine volume, as stated in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2333660"}]}
