The experiment is conducted in a physiological bath maintained at a constant temperature of $37^\\circ$C.\n\nThe team's initial findings suggest that SynapGuard acts as a selective agonist for a novel type of ligand-gated postsynaptic channel that is exclusively permeable to chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$).

In network terms, let $Y$ be the admittance matrix of the passive dendrite-soma-AIS tree; the voltage transfer is given by $G=Y^{-1}$.
