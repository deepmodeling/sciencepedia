While we often focus on the major building blocks like carbon and nitrogen, sometimes the culprit behind a failed experiment is a nutrient required in only tiny amounts. This practice problem simulates a realistic industrial scenario where you must act as a detective, using your knowledge of microbial chemical requirements to diagnose why a previously successful fermentation has suddenly failed [@problem_id:2058395].", "problem": "A biotechnology company is conducting a large-scale fermentation of an engineered strain of the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The goal is to produce a valuable therapeutic protein. The yeast is cultivated in a chemically defined minimal medium that is meticulously prepared. This medium contains glucose as the sole carbon and energy source, ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source, and potassium phosphate to supply both potassium and phosphorus.\n\nInitially, the fermentation runs were highly successful, yielding large quantities of the protein. For these runs, the medium was prepared using standard filtered municipal water. In an effort to enhance process reproducibility and eliminate potential contaminants, the production manager mandated a switch to using highly purified, deionized water for all subsequent media preparations.\n\nUpon making this change, the next fermentation batch failed. The yeast culture exhibited a brief period of logarithmic growth, but then growth ceased prematurely, and the final protein yield was less than 5% of the target amount. All other operational parameters, including temperature, pH, aeration, and inoculum size, were confirmed to be identical to the previous successful runs.\n\nBased on these observations, the absence of which of the following general categories of chemical requirements is the most probable cause for the fermentation failure?\n\nA. Essential amino acids\nB. Carbon source\nC. Trace elements\nD. Nitrogen source\nE. Vitamins", "solution": "1. Identify the only process change: the switch from standard filtered municipal water to highly purified deionized water. All other parameters and medium components remained the same.\n2. List the explicitly provided macronutrients in the defined minimal medium: glucose (carbon and energy source), ammonium sulfate (nitrogen source), and potassium phosphate (potassium and phosphorus). Therefore:\n   - Option B (carbon source) is present and cannot explain the failure.\n   - Option D (nitrogen source) is present and cannot explain the failure.\n3. Consider Option A (essential amino acids). Prototrophic strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly used for defined minimal media, synthesize amino acids de novo and do not require exogenous essential amino acids for growth. Moreover, prior successful runs used the same formulation except for the water source, so a requirement for essential amino acids is unlikely to explain the change in outcome.\n4. Discriminate between Options C (trace elements) and E (vitamins). Both are often required in minimal media, and cells can initially grow using intracellular reserves, leading to a brief logarithmic phase followed by growth cessation when reserves are depleted. However, the key distinguishing factor is the impact of the water source:\n   - Municipal water typically contains low concentrations of various metal ions (e.g., $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$, $\\text{Fe}^{2+}/\\text{Fe}^{3+}$, $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$, $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$, $\\text{Cu}^{2+}$, $\\text{Co}^{2+}$, $\\text{MoO}_{4}^{2-}$), which can inadvertently supply necessary trace elements for microbial growth.\n   - Deionized water removes these ions, eliminating this inadvertent supply.\n   - Municipal water does not meaningfully supply vitamins (organic cofactors such as biotin, thiamine), so a switch to deionized water would not be expected to remove a vitamin source that was previously present.\n5. The observation of initial growth followed by premature cessation is consistent with depletion of intracellular stores of trace metals that serve as enzyme cofactors (e.g., Fe in cytochromes, Zn in various dehydrogenases and transcription factors, Mn in superoxide dismutase). Therefore, the most probable missing category due to the switch to deionized water is trace elements.\n\nConclusion: The failure most likely resulted from absence of trace elements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2058395"}, {"introduction": "Moving from troubleshooting to proactive design is a key skill for a microbiologist.
