Designs that confound variables or that sample too narrow a range risk missing the true optimum.\n\nEvaluate options against these criteria:\n1) Option A uses a single NaCl level, approximately seawater salinity, corresponding to 3.5%. A single-point test cannot determine an optimum because it provides no comparative gradient and could easily miss the true maximum. Therefore, it is not rigorous.\n\n2) Option B tests 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%. This range is narrow and centered below typical marine salinity (3.5%). For a deep-sea hydrothermal isolate, the optimum could be at or above 3.5%, possibly extending into higher halotolerance. This design risks failing to include the true optimum if it lies above 2.0%.\n\n3) Option C tests 0%, 2.0%, 4.0%, 6.0%, and 8.0%. This spans from no added salt through typical marine-like and into moderate to high halophilic levels. It varies only NaCl on a single medium (TSA), holds other conditions constant, and covers a broad plausible range for a marine-related isolate, making it appropriate and rigorous for detecting an optimum.\n\n4) Option D varies the nutrient medium (e.g., TSA vs. other agars) while fixing NaCl at about 3.5%. This confounds medium composition with NaCl concentration, preventing attribution of growth differences specifically to NaCl.\n\n5) Option E varies pH (from 5 to 9) at fixed NaCl (3.5%). This tests pH preference rather than NaCl concentration and thus does not address the stated goal.\n\nBy the criterion of varying only the target variable (NaCl) across an appropriately broad and relevant range while holding all else constant, Option C is the most appropriate and scientifically rigorous design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2085904"}, {"introduction": "After conducting an experiment, the next critical step is interpreting the results. The growth patterns of microbes in response to varying salt concentrations provide vital clues about their physiology and their natural habitat. This exercise presents a classic scenario that will test your ability to distinguish between an \"obligate halophile,\" which requires salt to live, and a \"halotolerant\" organism, which can simply endure it [@problem_id:2085921].", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying two distinct microorganisms, designated Strain X and Strain Y, which were isolated from a natural salt flat. To characterize their physiological response to osmotic stress, the microbiologist prepares two types of sterile culture broths. Broth A is a standard nutrient medium prepared with deionized water, having a negligible salt concentration. Broth B is an identical nutrient medium, but it has been supplemented with sodium chloride (NaCl) to a final concentration of 15% (w/v).\n\nBoth strains are inoculated into separate flasks containing Broth A and Broth B and incubated under otherwise identical optimal conditions. The microbiologist records the following observations:\n\n-   **Strain X**: In Broth A (no salt), the cells quickly undergo lysis and no growth is observed. In Broth B (15% salt), the strain exhibits robust growth.\n-   **Strain Y**: In Broth A (no salt), the strain exhibits slow but sustained growth. In Broth B (15% salt), the strain grows, but less vigorously than it does in Broth A.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements correctly classifies the two microorganisms?\n\nA. Strain X is an obligate halophile, and Strain Y is also an obligate halophile.\n\nB. Strain X is a halotolerant organism, and Strain Y is a nonhalophile.\n\nC. Strain X is an obligate halophile, and Strain Y is a halotolerant organism.\n\nD. Strain X is a nonhalophile, and Strain Y is an obligate halophile.\n\nE. Both Strain X and Strain Y are halotolerant organisms.", "solution": "We are given two strains inoculated into two media that differ only in NaCl content: Broth A is essentially no-salt, Broth B contains 15% (w/v) NaCl, which constitutes a high-salt, hyperosmotic medium. The observations are:\n- Strain X: in Broth A, cells lyse and do not grow; in Broth B, robust growth.\n- Strain Y: in Broth A, slow but sustained growth; in Broth B, growth occurs but is less vigorous than in Broth A.\n\nRelevant physiological principles:\n- Obligate halophiles require high external NaCl to maintain cell wall integrity, membrane stability, and osmotic balance; they do not grow in low-salt conditions and may lyse in hypoosmotic media due to water influx.\n- Halotolerant organisms can grow without added salt but are capable of tolerating and growing in high-salt media; their growth is often optimal at lower salt and reduced at high salt.\n- Nonhalophiles grow in low-salt media and typically do not grow in high-salt media such as 15% (w/v) NaCl.\n\nClassification of Strain X:\n- Immediate lysis and no growth in no-salt medium indicates an inability to survive hypoosmotic conditions, consistent with a requirement for high external NaCl to prevent osmotic swelling and maintain structural stability.\n- Robust growth in high-salt medium confirms that high salinity is required for growth.\n- Therefore, Strain X is an obligate halophile.\n\nClassification of Strain Y:\n- Slow but sustained growth in no-salt medium shows it can grow without salt; therefore it is not an obligate halophile.\n- Growth in high-salt medium, albeit less vigorous than in no-salt, indicates tolerance to high salt; therefore it is not a nonhalophile.\n- Together, these features are characteristic of a halotolerant organism.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is false because Strain Y is not an obligate halophile.\n- B is false because Strain X is not halotolerant; it fails to grow and lyses in no-salt.\n- C is consistent with the inferences: Strain X is an obligate halophile; Strain Y is halotolerant.\n- D is false: Strain X is not a nonhalophile, and Strain Y is not an obligate halophile.\n- E is false because Strain X is not halotolerant.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2085921"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying optimal conditions, microbiologists often need to quantify microbial performance.
