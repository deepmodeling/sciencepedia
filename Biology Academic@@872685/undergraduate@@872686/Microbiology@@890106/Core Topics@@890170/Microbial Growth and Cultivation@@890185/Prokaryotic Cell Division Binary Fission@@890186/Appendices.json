A small container of this milk becomes contaminated with an initial population of 25 cells of a psychrotrophic bacterium. The container is inadvertently left at a temperature of 20°C for a total period of 8 hours. The bacterium has a known lag phase of 90 minutes under these conditions, during which no cell division occurs. After the lag phase, the bacteria enter an exponential growth phase with a generation time of 30 minutes. Assuming ideal growth conditions after the lag phase, calculate the total number of bacterial cells in the container at the end of the 8-hour period.", "solution": "We identify the initial cell count as $N_{0}=25$. The total time at permissive temperature is $T=8$ hours, which is $480$ minutes. The lag phase lasts $T_{\\text{lag}}=90$ minutes, during which no growth occurs, so the duration of exponential growth is\n$$\nt = 480 - 90 = 390 \\text{ minutes}.\n$$\nThe generation time in exponential phase is $g=30$ minutes, so the number of generations is\n$$\nn = \\frac{t}{g} = \\frac{390}{30} = 13.\n$$\nUnder ideal binary fission, the population after $n$ generations is\n$$\nN = N_{0}\\,2^{n} = 25 \\cdot 2^{13}.\n$$\nCompute $2^{13}$:\n$$\n2^{13} = 2^{10}\\cdot 2^{3} = 1024 \\cdot 8 = 8192,\n$$\nhence\n$$\nN = 25 \\cdot 8192 = 204800.\n$$\nTherefore, the total number of bacterial cells at the end of the $8$-hour period is $204800$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{204800}$$", "id": "2089404"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the macroscopic outcome of bacterial division, we now zoom in to the cellular level to examine the intricate molecular choreography involved. Successful binary fission requires the precise coordination of DNA replication and segregation with the assembly of the division machinery. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2089422] asks you to predict the visual outcome of an experiment tracking the key players—the chromosome and the FtsZ protein—thereby testing your understanding of their spatial relationship during cytokinesis.", "problem": "A research team is investigating the process of binary fission in the rod-shaped bacterium *Bacillus subtilis*. They are using advanced fluorescence microscopy to simultaneously visualize two key cellular components. The bacterial chromosome is labeled with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) that binds to DNA, causing the cell's nucleoid to fluoresce green. The FtsZ protein, a critical component of the cell division machinery, is tagged with a red fluorescent protein (RFP), causing it to fluoresce red.\n\nThe researchers examine a large population of bacteria and focus on cells that are clearly in the process of preparing for division, characterized by being elongated and having initiated cytokinesis. Given this experimental setup, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected spatial arrangement of the green (DNA) and red (FtsZ) signals within a single such bacterium?\n\nA. A single, large green region corresponding to the nucleoid is observed at the exact center of the cell, with a red ring of FtsZ protein forming around it.\n\nB. A red ring of FtsZ protein is observed at the midpoint of the cell, while two distinct green regions, corresponding to two segregated nucleoids, are observed near the two opposite poles of the cell.\n\nC. Two distinct green regions (nucleoids) are observed near the cell poles, while the red FtsZ signal is observed diffusely distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm with no distinct structure.\n\nD. The red FtsZ protein and the green DNA signal are both observed as two separate, co-localized clusters near the two opposite poles of the cell.\n\nE. A single, large green region (nucleoid) is observed at the center of the cell, while the red FtsZ protein is observed as two distinct caps at the poles of the cell.", "solution": "Define the long axis of a rod-shaped bacterium as a one-dimensional coordinate $x \\in [-L/2, L/2]$, where $x=0$ is the midcell and $x=\\pm L/2$ are the poles, with $L$ the cell length at the predivisional stage.\n\nThe assembly of the FtsZ Z-ring is governed by two key principles:\n- Site selection: The Min system in rod-shaped bacteria biases division to midcell, so the positional cue for Z-ring formation is maximal at $x=0$ and minimal at the poles. Denote this positional bias as $M(x)$, with $M(0)$ maximal and $M(\\pm L/2)$ minimal.\n- Nucleoid occlusion: FtsZ assembly is inhibited where the nucleoid (DNA) occupies space. If $\\rho_{\\text{DNA}}(x)$ is the local DNA density, then the net propensity for FtsZ assembly can be represented as a decreasing function of $\\rho_{\\text{DNA}}(x)$, for example $S(x) \\propto M(x)\\,g(\\rho_{\\text{DNA}}(x))$ with $g'(\\rho)<0$.\n\nIn predivisional, elongated cells that have initiated cytokinesis, chromosome replication and segregation have progressed so that two daughter nucleoids have moved away from midcell to opposite halves of the cell. This yields a DNA-depleted zone at $x=0$ (future septation site), so $\\rho_{\\text{DNA}}(0)$ is low relative to positions in either half, where two nucleoid masses localize near opposite sides (closer to the poles). Consequently, $S(x)$ is maximized at $x=0$, leading to a distinct FtsZ Z-ring at midcell, while the DNA signal appears as two separated green regions in the two cell halves.\n\nEvaluating the options against these principles:\n- Option A (single central nucleoid with a red ring around it) contradicts nucleoid occlusion, which prevents Z-ring formation over DNA.\n- Option B (red ring at midcell with two green nucleoids near opposite poles) matches the expected arrangement: FtsZ at $x=0$ and segregated nucleoids away from midcell.\n- Option C (diffuse red FtsZ without structure) contradicts the well-defined Z-ring at midcell during cytokinesis.\n- Option D (both signals co-localized near poles) contradicts the midcell Z-ring and the separation of nucleoids from the septation site.\n- Option E (red caps at poles with central nucleoid) contradicts midcell Z-ring formation in vegetative division.\n\nTherefore, the correct spatial arrangement is a midcell FtsZ Z-ring with two segregated nucleoids toward opposite halves/poles, as described in Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2089422"}, {"introduction": "The elegant choreography of cell division does not happen by accident; it is governed by sophisticated regulatory systems that prevent catastrophic errors. One such system, nucleoid occlusion, acts as a quality control checkpoint to protect the cell's genetic material. This problem [@problem_id:2089440] challenges you to deduce the consequences of a failure in this system, forcing you to consider why segregating the chromosome from the division site is absolutely essential for creating viable daughter cells.", "problem": "In prokaryotic cells such as *Escherichia coli*, cell division through binary fission is a tightly regulated process. The cell must accurately replicate its single, circular chromosome and then segregate the two resulting chromosomes to opposite poles before cytokinesis can divide the cell into two genetically identical daughters. A critical control mechanism, known as nucleoid occlusion, prevents the cytokinetic machinery (the FtsZ protein ring, or Z-ring) from assembling and constricting over the chromosome (the nucleoid).\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant strain of *E. coli* in which the nucleoid occlusion system is completely non-functional. In this strain, the Z-ring assembles at the cell's midpoint irrespective of the nucleoid's position. If environmental conditions trigger cytokinesis in one such mutant cell at a moment when its single chromosome has not yet replicated and is positioned directly in the center of the cell, the constricting Z-ring will cleave the un-replicated nucleoid.\n\nWhat is the most probable, immediate fate of the two daughter cells produced from this specific division event?\n\nA. One daughter cell will be viable and replicate normally, while the other will be non-viable.\n\nB. Both daughter cells will be non-viable.\n\nC. Both daughter cells will be viable but will exhibit a significantly slower growth rate than wild-type cells.\n\nD. Both daughter cells will immediately enter a dormant, spore-like state to survive the genetic damage.\n\nE. The two daughter cells will fuse back together to form a single, polyploid cell.", "solution": "Nucleoid occlusion prevents assembly and constriction of the FtsZ Z-ring over the chromosome to avoid “guillotining” DNA. In the mutant described, this safeguard is absent, so the Z-ring assembles at mid-cell irrespective of nucleoid position.\n\nGiven the single, circular chromosome has not replicated and lies centered when cytokinesis initiates, the constricting septum will cleave the chromosome, producing two daughter compartments that each inherit only a fragment of the original genome. Because Escherichia coli viability requires at least one intact, complete chromosome, a double-strand break that divides the single chromosome into two large linear fragments leaves each daughter missing essential genes and lacking a functional, intact replicon. E. coli lacks the systems to maintain and replicate such truncated linear fragments; transcription of essential genes will be incomplete or lost, and replication cannot proceed.\n\nTherefore, neither daughter will possess a complete genome, and both will be non-viable. This contrasts with cases where septation occurs away from the nucleoid (e.g., polar division yielding an anucleate minicell and a nucleated viable daughter), which does not apply here because the single chromosome is bisected at mid-cell. E. coli also does not form spores, and cell fusion is not a physiological response to such damage. Slower growth cannot rescue the absence of a complete genome.\n\nThus, the most probable immediate fate is that both daughters are non-viable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2089440"}]}
