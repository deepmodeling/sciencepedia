Two strains are used: Strain A, the wild-type, and Strain B, a mutant strain in which the gene of interest has been deleted.\n\nTo quantify biofilm production, the researcher employs a crystal violet (CV) staining assay. Both bacterial strains are cultured under identical conditions in the wells of a microtiter plate, allowing biofilms to form on the plastic surfaces. A set of wells containing only sterile culture medium serves as a negative control to account for background staining. After an incubation period, all wells are washed to remove non-adherent planktonic cells. The remaining adherent biofilms are then stained with CV dye. After a final wash to remove excess dye, the CV that has stained the biofilm mass is solubilized, and its concentration is measured using a spectrophotometer. The resulting measurement, known as Optical Density (OD), is directly proportional to the total biofilm mass attached to the well surface.\n\nThe average measurements for the Optical Density at 570 nm ($OD_{570}$) are as follows:\n- Strain A (wild-type): $OD_{570} = 0.934$\n- Strain B (mutant): $OD_{570} = 0.312$\n- Negative Control (sterile medium): $OD_{570} = 0.068$\n\nCalculate the biofilm formation of the mutant Strain B relative to the wild-type Strain A.

This switch is not random; it is tightly regulated by intracellular signaling networks. This exercise delves into the central role of the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP ($c$-di-GMP), challenging you to predict the outcomes of motility, biofilm, and gene expression experiments when the levels of this master regulator are genetically altered [@problem_id:2055913].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the regulatory network governing the lifestyle switch in a newly discovered bacterium, *Pseudomonas fictitium*. It is hypothesized that this switch between a free-swimming (planktonic) state and a surface-attached (sessile) biofilm state is controlled by the intracellular concentration of the second messenger Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). In this organism, a key diguanylate cyclase, DgcA, is responsible for synthesizing c-di-GMP, and a key phosphodiesterase, PdeH, is responsible for its degradation.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the researcher constructs three isogenic strains of *P. fictitium*:\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT):** The standard, unmodified strain with functional `dgcA` and `pdeH` genes.\n2.  **ΔdgcA mutant:** A strain with a complete deletion of the `dgcA` gene, rendering it unable to produce c-di-GMP via this primary pathway.\n3.  **ΔpdeH mutant:** A strain with a complete deletion of the `pdeH` gene, leading to the accumulation of c-di-GMP due to impaired degradation.\n\nThe researcher plans to conduct three experiments to compare the phenotypes of these strains:\n\n*   **Experiment I (Motility):** A motility assay will be performed by inoculating the center of a soft agar plate (0.3% agar) with each strain. The diameter of the circular zone of swimming bacteria will be measured after 24 hours. A larger diameter indicates greater motility.\n*   **Experiment II (Biofilm Formation):** A static biofilm assay will be conducted in a polystyrene microtiter plate. After 48 hours of growth, non-adherent cells will be washed away, and the remaining attached biofilm will be stained with crystal violet. The amount of biofilm will be quantified by measuring the absorbance of the solubilized stain at 550 nm ($A_{550}$). A higher absorbance indicates more biofilm.\n*   **Experiment III (Gene Expression):** The relative transcript levels of two genes will be measured using quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The genes are `flgK`, which encodes a crucial component of the flagellar hook, and `bapA`, which encodes a key surface adhesion protein involved in initiating biofilm formation.\n\nAssuming the c-di-GMP hypothesis is correct, which of the following options most accurately predicts the relative outcomes of these three experiments?\n\n**A.**\n*   Motility Diameter: WT > ΔdgcA > ΔpdeH\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): ΔpdeH > ΔdgcA > WT\n*   Gene Expression: High `flgK` in ΔdgcA; High `bapA` in ΔpdeH\n\n**B.**\n*   Motility Diameter: ΔpdeH > WT > ΔdgcA\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): ΔdgcA > WT > ΔpdeH\n*   Gene Expression: High `flgK` in ΔpdeH; High `bapA` in ΔdgcA\n\n**C.**\n*   Motility Diameter: ΔdgcA > WT > ΔpdeH\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): ΔpdeH > WT > ΔdgcA\n*   Gene Expression: High `flgK` in ΔdgcA; High `bapA` in ΔpdeH\n\n**D.**\n*   Motility Diameter: ΔdgcA > WT > ΔpdeH\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): ΔpdeH > WT > ΔdgcA\n*   Gene Expression: High `flgK` in ΔpdeH; High `bapA` in ΔdgcA\n\n**E.**\n*   Motility Diameter: WT ≈ ΔdgcA ≈ ΔpdeH\n*   Biofilm ($A_{550}$): WT ≈ ΔdgcA ≈ ΔpdeH\n*   Gene Expression: Equal `flgK` and `bapA` levels in all strains", "solution": "The core regulatory principle is that intracellular cyclic-di-GMP promotes the sessile biofilm lifestyle and antagonizes the motile planktonic lifestyle. Therefore, increasing cyclic-di-GMP decreases swimming motility and increases biofilm formation, while decreasing cyclic-di-GMP does the opposite. At the gene expression level, cyclic-di-GMP typically represses flagellar gene expression and activates adhesin/biofilm gene expression. For the specific markers here, this implies that $flgK$ (flagellar hook component) expression is inversely related to cyclic-di-GMP, while $bapA$ (adhesion factor) expression is positively related to cyclic-di-GMP.\n\nDefine $[c]$ as the intracellular cyclic-di-GMP concentration. By strain construction:\n- In the $\\Delta dgcA$ mutant, synthesis via the primary cyclase is abolished, so $[c]_{\\Delta dgcA}$ is reduced relative to wild type.\n- In the wild type, both synthesis and degradation are intact, so $[c]_{WT}$ is at an intermediate baseline.\n- In the $\\Delta pdeH$ mutant, degradation is impaired, so $[c]_{\\Delta pdeH}$ is elevated.\n\nThus the ordering of intracellular cyclic-di-GMP is\n$$\n[c]_{\\Delta dgcA} < [c]_{WT} < [c]_{\\Delta pdeH}.\n$$\n\nSwimming motility diameter in soft agar is inversely related to $[c]$. Denoting motility by $M$, this gives the ordering\n$$\nM_{\\Delta dgcA} > M_{WT} > M_{\\Delta pdeH}.\n$$\n\nBiofilm formation, quantified by $A_{550}$ after crystal violet staining, is positively related to $[c]$. Denoting biofilm by $B$, this gives\n$$\nB_{\\Delta pdeH} > B_{WT} > B_{\\Delta dgcA}.\n$$\n\nFor gene expression, let $E_{flgK}$ and $E_{bapA}$ denote relative transcript levels. The inverse relationship for flagellar genes yields\n$$\nE_{flgK,\\ \\Delta dgcA} > E_{flgK,\\ WT} > E_{flgK,\\ \\Delta pdeH},\n$$\nand the positive relationship for adhesion/biofilm genes yields\n$$\nE_{bapA,\\ \\Delta pdeH} > E_{bapA,\\ WT} > E_{bapA,\\ \\Delta dgcA}.\n$$\n\nThese predictions correspond to the option stating: motility $\\Delta dgcA > WT > \\Delta pdeH$, biofilm $\\Delta pdeH > WT > \\Delta dgcA$, and high $flgK$ in $\\Delta dgcA$ with high $bapA$ in $\\Delta pdeH$.
