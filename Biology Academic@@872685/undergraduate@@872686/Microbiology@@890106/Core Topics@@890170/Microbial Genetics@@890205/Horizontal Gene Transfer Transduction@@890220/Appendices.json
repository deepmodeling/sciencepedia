The goal is to determine the frequency at which a kanamycin resistance gene (`_kanR_`) is transferred from a donor strain to a recipient strain.\n\nThe donor strain is kanR (kanamycin-resistant) and strS (streptomycin-sensitive). The recipient strain is kanS (kanamycin-sensitive) and strR (streptomycin-resistant).\n\nThe experiment proceeds in two main parts:\n\n1.  **Quantification of Recipient Cells**: To determine the concentration of the recipient bacterial culture, the student performs a serial dilution. A 100 µL volume from the 10⁻⁶ dilution tube is spread onto a non-selective agar plate. After incubation, 145 colonies are counted. These colonies are referred to as Colony-Forming Units (CFU).\n\n2.  **Transduction and Selection**: The student mixes 0.75 mL of the undiluted recipient culture with 0.25 mL of the P1 phage lysate that was prepared on the donor strain. After a brief incubation period to allow for phage infection, the entire 1.00 mL mixture is plated onto a selective agar plate containing both kanamycin and streptomycin. Kanamycin selects for cells that have received the `_kanR_` gene, while streptomycin eliminates any surviving donor cells.

The closer two genes are, the more likely they are to be packaged into the same phage head and transferred together, a phenomenon known as cotransduction.

The researcher uses a generalized transducing bacteriophage, designated Phage P3, to move genetic material between a donor strain (`$tetX^+ aroE^+$`) and a recipient strain (`$tetX^- aroE^-$`).\n\nThe DNA capacity of the Phage P3 head is known to be 110 kilobases (kb). After performing the transduction, the researcher selects for recipient cells that have successfully incorporated the `_tetX_` gene (becoming `$tetX^+$`). They then screen a large population of these `$tetX^+$` transductants to determine what fraction of them have also acquired the `_aroE_` gene (becoming `$aroE^+$`). The experimental results show that the cotransduction frequency of `_tetX_` and `_aroE_` is 0.18.\n\nAssuming the relationship between cotransduction frequency, gene distance, and phage DNA capacity is described by the Wu formula, calculate the physical distance between the `_tetX_` and `_aroE_` genes.

This final practice challenges you to synthesize data from two distinct mapping techniques—cotransduction and deletion mapping—to function as a genetic detective [@problem_id:2071213]. By interpreting both frequency data and the logic of genetic recombination, you will deduce the precise location of a point mutation, mirroring the process researchers use to characterize novel genetic variants.", "problem": "Researchers in a synthetic biology lab are working to optimize the production of a novel therapeutic peptide in *Escherichia coli*. The synthesis of this peptide is dependent on a single gene, `_pepA_`. They have isolated a mutant strain, designated `_pepA1_`, which carries a single point mutation rendering the `_pepA_` gene non-functional. To engineer a fix, they must first precisely locate this mutation. They perform two types of generalized transduction experiments using Bacteriophage P1.\n\n**Experiment 1: Cotransduction Mapping**\nTo determine the arrangement of genes neighboring `_pepA_`, a P1 lysate was prepared from a wild-type donor strain with the genotype `$metB^+ pepA^+ thrC^+ argH^+$`. This lysate was used to transduce a recipient strain that is auxotrophic for all four markers (`$metB^- pepA^- thrC^- argH^-$`). Transductants were selected for the `$metB^+$` marker, and then screened for the unselected markers `_pepA_`, `_thrC_`, and `_argH_`.

This lysate was then used to transduce four different recipient strains. Each recipient strain carried a different, well-characterized deletion affecting the `_pepA_` gene region. The researchers scored whether wild-type (`$pepA^+$`) recombinants could be formed in each cross. The deletions and results are summarized below:\n\n| Recipient Deletion Strain | Description of Deleted Region | Formation of `$pepA^+$` Recombinants |\n| :---: | :--- | :---: |\n| `Δ1` | The entire `_pepA_L_` segment. | Yes |\n| `Δ2` | The entire `_pepA_R_` segment. | Yes |\n| `Δ3` | The entire `_pepA_L_` and `_pepA_M_` segments. | No |\n| `Δ4` | The entire `_pepA_M_` and `_pepA_R_` segments. | No |\n\nBased on the combined results of both experiments, in which segment of the `_pepA_` gene is the `_pepA1_` mutation located?\n\nA. `_pepA_L_`\n\nB. `_pepA_M_`\n\nC. `_pepA_R_`\n\nD. The data from the two experiments are contradictory.\n\nE. The mutation is located outside of the `_pepA_` gene.", "solution": "Principle for Experiment 1 (P1 cotransduction mapping): With generalized transduction by P1, the cotransduction frequency between two markers decreases monotonically with the physical distance between them because P1 packages a limited DNA length. Thus, higher cotransduction implies closer proximity. Let $f_{\\text{cot}}(X,Y)$ denote the cotransduction frequency and $d(X,Y)$ the map distance. Then $f_{\\text{cot}}(X,Y)$ is inversely related to $d(X,Y)$.\n\nGiven $f_{\\text{cot}}(\\text{metB},\\text{pepA})=0.90$, $f_{\\text{cot}}(\\text{metB},\\text{thrC})=0.45$, and $f_{\\text{cot}}(\\text{metB},\\text{argH})=0.02$, we infer\n$$\nd(\\text{metB},\\text{pepA})<d(\\text{metB},\\text{thrC})\\ll d(\\text{metB},\\text{argH}).\n$$\nTherefore, $\\text{pepA}$ lies very close to $\\text{metB}$, and $\\text{thrC}$ is farther from $\\text{metB}$ than $\\text{pepA}$. This is consistent with the stated orientation that within $\\text{pepA}$, the segment $\\text{pepA\\_L}$ is the side closest to $\\text{metB}$ and $\\text{pepA\\_R}$ is the side closest to $\\text{thrC}$.\n\nPrinciple for Experiment 2 (deletion mapping with a donor carrying a point mutation): Let the position of the point mutation $\\_pepA1\\_$ within $\\_pepA\\_$ be $x$, and let the three non-overlapping gene segments be $L$, $M$, and $R$ (corresponding to `_pepA_L_`, `_pepA_M_`, `_pepA_R_`). In a transduction using donor DNA that carries the point mutation, a `$pepA^{+}$` recombinant can be formed only if the deleted region in the recipient does not include the mutation site $x$. Formally, if a recipient deletion removes a set $D\\subseteq\\{L,M,R\\}$, then:\n- If $x\\in D$, any recombinant that restores the deletion with donor DNA will import the mutant base at $x$, yielding no `$pepA^{+}$` recombinants.\n- If $x\\notin D$, recombination can restore the deleted region from donor DNA while leaving the site $x$ in the recipient-derived (wild-type) portion, allowing `$pepA^{+}$` recombinants.\n\nApply this to the four deletions:\n- $\\Delta 1$ deletes $L$ and yields Yes. Therefore $x\\notin L$.\n- $\\Delta 2$ deletes $R$ and yields Yes. Therefore $x\\notin R$.\n- $\\Delta 3$ deletes $L\\cup M$ and yields No. Therefore $x\\in L\\cup M$.\n- $\\Delta 4$ deletes $M\\cup R$ and yields No. Therefore $x\\in M\\cup R$.\n\nCombine the constraints:\nFrom $x\\notin L$ and $x\\in L\\cup M$, it follows that $x\\in M$.\nFrom $x\\notin R$ and $x\\in M\\cup R$, it follows that $x\\in M$.\nBoth pairs consistently locate the mutation in $M$.\n\nConclusion: The point mutation `_pepA1_` resides in the middle segment, `_pepA_M_`, which is consistent with the cotransduction-based orientation relative to `_metB_` and `_thrC_`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2071213"}]}
