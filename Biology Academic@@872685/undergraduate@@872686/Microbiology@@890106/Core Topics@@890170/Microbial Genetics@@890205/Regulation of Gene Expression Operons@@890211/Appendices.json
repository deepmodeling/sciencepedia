This exercise [@problem_id:2090992] explores the fundamental role of the operator sequence as the binding site for a repressor protein. By considering a hypothetical scenario where this site is deleted, you can clearly dissect the logic of transcriptional repression and predict the consequences of disrupting this critical interaction.", "problem": "A newly discovered bacterium, *Pseudomonas saccharophila*, is capable of metabolizing the complex sugar galacturonate. The genes required for this metabolic pathway are organized into an inducible operon, termed the *galu* operon. This operon is under negative control. A regulatory gene, *galuR*, located elsewhere on the chromosome, produces a repressor protein that is active in its default state. In the absence of galacturonate, this repressor protein binds to a specific DNA sequence called the operator, which is located between the promoter and the structural genes (*galuA*, *galuB*, *galuC*), thereby blocking transcription. The presence of galacturonate (or one of its metabolites) serves as an inducer, which binds to the repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents it from binding to the operator.\n\nA research team creates a mutant strain of *P. saccharophila* in which the entire operator DNA sequence of the *galu* operon has been precisely deleted, leaving the promoter and the structural genes intact. Which of the following statements best describes the expression of the structural genes *galuA*, *galuB*, and *galuC* in this mutant strain?\n\nA. The structural genes will be expressed continuously, regardless of the presence or absence of galacturonate.\n\nB. The structural genes will never be expressed, regardless of the presence or absence of galacturonate.\n\nC. The expression of the structural genes will still be inducible by galacturonate, but the maximum level of expression will be significantly lower than in the wild-type strain.\n\nD. The expression of the structural genes will be repressible by galacturonate, meaning they are expressed only in its absence.\n\nE. The expression of the structural genes will remain unchanged from the wild-type, being expressed only in the presence of galacturonate.", "solution": "- The *galu* operon is under negative control: the regulatory gene *galuR* encodes a repressor that is active by default and binds the operator to block RNA polymerase progression from promoter to structural genes, thereby preventing transcription in the absence of inducer. This is the standard mechanism where an inducer (galacturonate or a metabolite) binds the repressor, alters its conformation, and prevents operator binding, allowing transcription (inducible expression).\n\n- The operator is a cis-acting DNA sequence located between the promoter and the structural genes. Its presence is required for the repressor to exert its inhibitory effect. The repressor protein is trans-acting and requires the operator site to bind and block transcription.\n\n- In the mutant described, the operator DNA sequence is precisely deleted while the promoter and structural genes remain intact. Therefore:\n  1) The repressor (from *galuR*) has no binding site and cannot bind DNA at the operon.\n  2) RNA polymerase can access the promoter and transcribe the structural genes without obstruction.\n  3) Because the repression mechanism is eliminated, expression no longer depends on the presence of galacturonate; the inducer cannot further increase expression beyond the promoter’s intrinsic activity because repression is already absent.\n\n- Consequently, expression of *galuA*, *galuB*, and *galuC* becomes constitutive (continuous) and is independent of the inducer. This mirrors the classic operator-constitutive (*O*c) phenotype known from the *lac* operon.\n\n- Evaluating options:\n  A. Constitutive expression regardless of inducer — correct.\n  B. Never expressed — incorrect; promoter is intact and repression is impossible.\n  C. Still inducible but with lower maximum — incorrect; no repression remains to be relieved.\n  D. Repressible by galacturonate — incorrect; reverses logic of negative inducible control.\n  E. Unchanged from wild-type (only in presence of inducer) — incorrect; repression cannot occur in the mutant.\n\nTherefore, the best description is constitutive expression regardless of galacturonate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2090992"}, {"introduction": "Bacterial gene regulation is often a multi-layered process, involving more than just a simple on/off switch. This problem [@problem_id:2090924] delves into the famous *lac* operon to illustrate the concept of positive control, where an activator protein can significantly boost transcription levels. By analyzing the effect of removing the activator's binding site, you will learn how cells can fine-tune gene expression in response to different environmental signals.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the *lac* operon is a classic example of gene regulation. The expression of its structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*), which are involved in lactose metabolism, is controlled by two primary mechanisms. The first is negative control via the LacI repressor protein, which binds to the operator region to block transcription in the absence of lactose. When lactose is present, its isomer allolactose binds to the LacI repressor, preventing it from binding to the operator. The second mechanism is positive control via the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). In the absence of glucose, cellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) are high. The cAMP-CAP complex binds to a specific DNA sequence called the CAP binding site, located just upstream of the promoter. This binding event significantly enhances the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, leading to a high level of transcription.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that possesses a genetic deletion completely removing the CAP binding site from the *lac* operon's regulatory region. All other components of the operon and its regulatory proteins (including the promoter, operator, and the genes for LacI and CAP) are fully functional.\n\nIf this mutant strain is cultured in a growth medium that contains an abundance of lactose but is completely devoid of glucose, which of the following statements best describes the resulting level of transcription of the *lac* operon's structural genes?\n\nA. The operon will be fully induced and transcribed at the maximum possible rate.\n\nB. The operon will be completely silent, with no transcription occurring.\n\nC. The operon will be transcribed at a very low, basal level.\n\nD. The operon will become constitutively active, meaning it is transcribed at a high rate regardless of the presence of lactose or glucose.", "solution": "The *lac* operon is regulated by two mechanisms:\n- Negative control by LacI: in the absence of lactose, LacI binds the operator and blocks RNA polymerase; in the presence of lactose, allolactose binds LacI, preventing operator binding and lifting repression.\n- Positive control by the cAMP-CAP complex: in the absence of glucose, cAMP levels are high and cAMP-CAP binds the CAP site upstream of the promoter, increasing RNA polymerase recruitment and driving high transcription.\n\nIn the mutant described, the CAP binding site is deleted, while the promoter, operator, LacI, and CAP are intact and functional.\n\nUnder the given conditions (abundant lactose, no glucose):\n1. Lactose present implies allolactose binds LacI, so LacI cannot bind the operator. Therefore, negative repression is relieved and the operator is accessible to RNA polymerase.\n2. No glucose implies high cAMP and active CAP; however, the CAP binding site is absent, so the cAMP-CAP complex cannot bind DNA to stimulate transcription.\n\nWithout CAP-mediated activation, RNA polymerase must rely on the intrinsic (weak) *lac* promoter. Because repression is lifted but positive activation cannot occur, transcription proceeds only at the low, basal level characteristic of the unactivated promoter.\n\nTherefore, the operon is not fully induced (ruling out A), not completely silent because repression is relieved (ruling out B), and not constitutively high because positive activation is impossible and transcription still depends on lactose to relieve repression (ruling out D). The correct outcome is basal transcription.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2090924"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in genetics is not just understanding regulatory pathways, but also designing experiments to uncover them. This practice problem [@problem_id:2090930] puts you in the role of a microbiologist faced with two possible mutations that produce the same outcome. To solve the puzzle, you must apply your knowledge of *cis*-acting sites versus *trans*-acting proteins to interpret the results of a classic complementation test, a powerful tool for genetic analysis.", "problem": "In a newly discovered bacterium, the synthesis of a cryoprotectant protein, \"Cryo-P\", is controlled by the *cry* operon. This operon consists of a regulatory gene *cryR* that codes for a repressor protein, a promoter *P*, an operator *O*, and a structural gene *cryZ* for the Cryo-P protein. The expression of the *cry* operon is inducible; the repressor protein is active by default but is allosterically inactivated by a signaling molecule produced only at low temperatures, thus allowing transcription.\n\nA wild-type strain (*cryR*⁺ *O*⁺ *cryZ*⁺) synthesizes Cryo-P only when grown at low temperatures. A microbiologist isolates a mutant strain, designated M1, which exhibits constitutive expression of the *cryZ* gene, meaning it produces Cryo-P at both low and high temperatures. The mutation in M1 is known to be in either the *cryR* gene (resulting in a non-functional repressor, *cryR*⁻) or the operator site (preventing repressor binding, *O*c). The structural gene *cryZ* is not mutated.\n\nTo determine the nature of the mutation, the microbiologist performs a complementation test by introducing an F' plasmid into the M1 strain, creating a partial diploid (merozygote). The plasmid has the genotype *cryR*⁺ *O*⁺ *cryZ*⁻, where *cryZ*⁻ is a null allele that produces no functional Cryo-P.\n\nLet \"Inducible Phenotype\" be defined as the synthesis of Cryo-P only at low temperatures, and \"Constitutive Phenotype\" be defined as the synthesis of Cryo-P at both low and high temperatures. Which of the following options correctly describes the expected phenotype of the resulting merozygote for each possible original mutation in strain M1?\n\nA. *cryR*⁻ mutation leads to Inducible phenotype; *O*c mutation leads to Inducible phenotype.\n\nB. *cryR*⁻ mutation leads to Constitutive phenotype; *O*c mutation leads to Constitutive phenotype.\n\nC. *cryR*⁻ mutation leads to Constitutive phenotype; *O*c mutation leads to Inducible phenotype.\n\nD. *cryR*⁻ mutation leads to Inducible phenotype; *O*c mutation leads to Constitutive phenotype.\n\nE. This experiment cannot distinguish between the two mutations because the plasmid lacks a functional *cryZ* gene.", "solution": "We analyze regulation using standard operon logic: the repressor encoded by *cryR* is a trans-acting diffusible protein that binds the operator *O* to block transcription; inducers act allosterically on the repressor. The operator *O* is a cis-acting DNA site that affects only the linked structural gene *cryZ* on the same DNA molecule. The inducer is produced only at low temperatures and inactivates the repressor, permitting transcription.\n\nWild type *cryR*⁺ *O*⁺ *cryZ*⁺ is inducible: at high temperature (no inducer), active repressor binds *O* and blocks transcription; at low temperature (inducer present), repressor is inactivated and transcription proceeds.\n\nMutant M1 is constitutive and must be either:\n- *cryR*⁻ *O*⁺ *cryZ*⁺ (no functional repressor produced), or\n- *cryR*⁺ *O*c *cryZ*⁺ (operator cannot bind repressor; constitutive in cis).\n\nThe merozygote is formed by introducing an F' plasmid with *cryR*⁺ *O*⁺ *cryZ*⁻ into M1. Only the chromosomal *cryZ*⁺ can produce functional Cryo-P. The plasmid *cryR*⁺ produces functional repressor that can act in trans; the operator *O* acts only in cis.\n\nCase 1 (M1 is *cryR*⁻ *O*⁺ *cryZ*⁺):\n- Without plasmid: no repressor, so constitutive.\n- With plasmid: the plasmid-encoded *cryR*⁺ repressor is produced and diffuses to bind the chromosomal *O*⁺, repressing *cryZ*⁺ at high temperature. At low temperature, the inducer inactivates the repressor, allowing transcription. Therefore, repression is restored and the phenotype becomes inducible.\n\nCase 2 (M1 is *cryR*⁺ *O*c *cryZ*⁺):\n- Without plasmid: *O*c cannot bind repressor, so constitutive in cis.\n- With plasmid: although repressor is supplied in trans, it still cannot bind the chromosomal *O*c. The plasmid *cryZ*⁻ produces no Cryo-P, so the observed phenotype reflects the chromosomal allele, which remains constitutive.\n\nThus, in the merozygote, a *cryR*⁻ mutation gives an inducible phenotype (complemented in trans), whereas an *O*c mutation gives a constitutive phenotype (noncomplementable cis defect). Therefore the correct option is D.\n\nOption E is incorrect because one can still discriminate: Cryo-P production comes from the chromosomal *cryZ*⁺, and the trans-acting repressor from the plasmid complements *cryR*⁻ but not *O*c.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2090930"}]}
