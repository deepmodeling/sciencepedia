{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A common point of confusion in bacterial conjugation is understanding the outcome for the recipient cell in an Hfr cross. If an Hfr strain is defined by its \"high frequency of recombination,\" why doesn't it also convert recipient cells to F+ or Hfr status at a high rate? This practice problem addresses that fundamental question by exploring what happens when the transfer of the chromosome is stopped prematurely, which is the typical outcome in a laboratory setting. [@problem_id:2070936]", "problem": "In a microbiology experiment, a strain of *Escherichia coli* known as a High-frequency recombination (Hfr) cell is used. This strain has its fertility factor (F factor) integrated into its main bacterial chromosome. These Hfr cells are mixed with a large population of F- cells, which lack the F factor and cannot initiate conjugation. The two cell types are incubated together under conditions that allow conjugation to occur. However, after a relatively short period of time—much less than the approximately 100 minutes required for the complete transfer of the *E. coli* chromosome—the culture is placed in a blender and agitated at high speed. This mechanical disruption is known to break the conjugation bridges between the cells, thereby interrupting the transfer of genetic material.\n\nFollowing this interruption, the cells that were originally F- are isolated from the mixture. Which of the following statements best describes the most probable genetic state of the majority of these isolated recipient cells?\n\nA. The F- cells have converted to F+ cells.\n\nB. The F- cells have converted to Hfr cells.\n\nC. The F- cells remain F- but are now considered recombinant.\n\nD. The F- cells are completely unchanged, as the genetic transfer was unsuccessful.\n\nE. The F- cells have been lysed by the Hfr cells.", "solution": "An Hfr cell has the F factor integrated into its chromosome, so conjugation initiates at the origin of transfer within the integrated F factor and proceeds as a linear, single-stranded DNA transfer from donor to recipient through the conjugation bridge. In Hfr crosses, the transfer sequence begins with a portion of the integrated F factor and then proceeds into adjacent chromosomal genes. Because the F sequence is integrated and circularization of a complete F element in the recipient would require transfer of essentially the entire donor chromosome, conversion of the recipient to F+ (or Hfr) requires completion of transfer, which is highly unlikely when mating is interrupted early.\n\nIn the described experiment, mechanical agitation interrupts conjugation well before completion, so recipients virtually never receive the entire F element. Therefore, the recipients do not become F+ and do not become Hfr. However, before the bridge is broken, the donor typically transfers some chromosomal genes proximal to the origin. These incoming donor segments can undergo RecA-mediated homologous recombination with the recipient’s chromosome, replacing recipient alleles with donor alleles and generating a stable recombinant genotype. Because the F element is incomplete in the recipient, the cell remains F- despite having incorporated donor chromosomal DNA.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely because Hfr donors rarely convert recipients to F+; full F transfer is not achieved with early interruption.\n- B is even less likely; becoming Hfr would require full F transfer and appropriate integration.\n- C matches the hallmark of Hfr crosses: recipients remain F- but become recombinant by homologous recombination of transferred donor chromosomal DNA.\n- D is less accurate because gene transfer commonly begins before interruption, allowing recombination in many recipients.\n- E is incorrect because conjugation does not lyse recipient cells.\n\nTherefore, the most probable genetic state of the majority of isolated recipient cells is that they remain F- but are recombinant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2070936"}, {"introduction": "The transfer of genetic material is only the first step in creating a stable recombinant bacterium. For the new DNA to be passed down to subsequent generations, it must be integrated into the recipient's chromosome. This exercise delves into the essential molecular machinery required for this process, focusing on the critical role of the RecA protein in homologous recombination. By considering a scenario where this protein is non-functional, you can better appreciate why DNA transfer alone is not sufficient for inheritance. [@problem_id:2070963]", "problem": "In an experimental study of bacterial genetics, a microbiologist prepares two strains of *Escherichia coli*.\n\nThe donor strain is a High frequency of recombination (Hfr) strain. Its chromosome contains a copy of the F-factor integrated near the beginning of the *leu* operon. This strain is prototrophic for leucine (genotype $\\textit{leu}^+$) and is sensitive to the antibiotic streptomycin (genotype $\\textit{str}^S$).\n\nThe recipient strain is an F- strain. This strain is auxotrophic for leucine, meaning it cannot synthesize its own and requires it for growth (genotype $\\textit{leu}^-$). It is resistant to streptomycin (genotype $\\textit{str}^R$). Critically, this recipient strain also possesses a null mutation in the `recA` gene (genotype $\\textit{recA}^-$), rendering the RecA protein non-functional.\n\nThe two strains are mixed in a nutrient broth and incubated for a sufficient period to allow for the transfer of the $\\textit{leu}^+$ gene from the Hfr donors to the F- recipients. After incubation, the mixture is plated on a minimal agar medium that contains streptomycin but lacks leucine.\n\nBased on the known functions of the genes involved, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed after incubating the plate?\n\nA. The $\\textit{leu}^+$ gene fragment will be degraded by cellular nucleases because it cannot be integrated into the chromosome, and therefore no colonies will grow on the selective plate.\n\nB. The $\\textit{leu}^+$ gene will be successfully integrated into the recipient's chromosome via homologous recombination, resulting in the growth of a high number of $\\textit{leu}^+ \\textit{str}^R$ recombinant colonies.\n\nC. The transferred $\\textit{leu}^+$ gene fragment will self-circularize to form a small plasmid that possesses its own origin of replication, leading to the growth of $\\textit{leu}^+ \\textit{str}^R$ colonies.\n\nD. The recipient cells will be converted into Hfr strains that are also $\\textit{leu}^+$, leading to the growth of numerous colonies on the selective plate.\n\nE. The recipient cells will remain $\\textit{leu}^-$ but will become diploid for the `leu` locus, with the transferred $\\textit{leu}^+$ gene coexisting stably alongside the chromosomal $\\textit{leu}^-$ gene as an unintegrated linear fragment.", "solution": "Define donor genotype: Hfr $\\textit{leu}^+ \\textit{str}^S$ with F integrated near the leu operon. Define recipient genotype: F- $\\textit{leu}^- \\textit{str}^R \\textit{recA}^-$. In Hfr conjugation, transfer initiates at oriT within the integrated F and proceeds as a linear single-stranded fragment of donor chromosomal DNA into the recipient. After entry, the DNA is made double-stranded and must undergo homologous recombination with the recipient chromosome to be stably maintained and expressed.\n\nState the central requirement: Integration of a linear donor chromosomal fragment into the recipient chromosome requires RecA-mediated homologous recombination. RecA promotes strand invasion and exchange between homologous sequences. In a $\\textit{recA}^-$ recipient, homologous recombination is effectively abolished; consequently, incoming linear donor DNA cannot integrate.\n\nState the fate of non-integrated linear DNA: Donor linear DNA lacking an origin of replication cannot replicate autonomously. In the cytoplasm of the recipient, linear DNA that does not recombine is targeted and degraded by cellular nucleases. Therefore, without integration, the $\\textit{leu}^+$ allele will not be maintained or expressed.\n\nApply selection logic: The selective plate contains streptomycin and lacks leucine. Donor cells ($\\textit{str}^S$) are killed by streptomycin and cannot contribute colonies. Recipient cells ($\\textit{str}^R$) survive the antibiotic but are $\\textit{leu}^-$. Growth on minimal medium lacking leucine requires acquisition and expression of $\\textit{leu}^+$. Because $\\textit{recA}^-$ blocks recombination-dependent integration of $\\textit{leu}^+$, recipients will remain $\\textit{leu}^-$ and thus cannot grow on leucine-free medium.\n\nEvaluate alternatives:\n- B is false because RecA is required for homologous recombination; $\\textit{recA}^-$ prevents successful integration and hence prevents $\\textit{leu}^+$ conversion.\n- C is false because the transferred Hfr chromosomal fragment lacks an origin of replication and cannot self-circularize into a replicon that propagates as a plasmid in the absence of an appropriate ori.\n- D is false because conversion to Hfr requires transfer and integration of the F sequence; full transfer of F from Hfr is rare due to conjugation bridge breakage, and selection conditions kill donors; moreover, $\\textit{leu}^+$ expression still requires integration blocked by $\\textit{recA}^-$.\n- E is false because stable maintenance of an unintegrated linear donor fragment does not occur; without integration or an origin, it is degraded and cannot create a stable merodiploid state. Stable partial diploidy (merozygotes) typically arises via F' plasmids (sexduction), not Hfr chromosomal transfer, and still would not be stably maintained as a linear fragment.\n\nConclusion: The most likely outcome under these conditions is degradation of the transferred $\\textit{leu}^+$ fragment with no colony growth on the selective plate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2070963"}, {"introduction": "The predictable, linear transfer of genes from an Hfr donor provides a powerful tool for geneticists: a molecular clock for mapping the bacterial chromosome.
