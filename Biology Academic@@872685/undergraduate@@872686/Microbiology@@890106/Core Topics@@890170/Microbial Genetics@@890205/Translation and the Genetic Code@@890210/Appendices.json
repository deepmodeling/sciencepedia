The student knows that translation begins when the ribosome assembles on a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule and the first transfer RNA (tRNA) binds to the start codon. In prokaryotes, this initial tRNA carries a modified amino acid, N-formylmethionine. Given that the primary start codon on the mRNA is composed of the nucleotides Adenine, Uracil, and Guanine, what is the sequence of the corresponding anticodon on the initiator tRNA?\n\nThe sequence should be written in the standard 5' to 3' direction.\n\nA. 5'-AUG-3'\n\nB. 5'-GUA-3'\n\nC. 5'-UAC-3'\n\nD. 5'-CAU-3'\n\nE. 5'-CAT-3'", "solution": "The process of translating the genetic code from messenger RNA (mRNA) into a protein involves the interaction between codons on the mRNA and anticodons on transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules.\n\nFirst, we must identify the sequence of the start codon on the mRNA. The problem states that the primary start codon is composed of Adenine, Uracil, and Guanine. The standard start codon in virtually all organisms, including *E. coli*, is 5'-AUG-3'. This codon specifies the amino acid methionine. In prokaryotic initiation, it specifically codes for N-formylmethionine.\n\nNext, we determine the sequence of the anticodon on the tRNA that recognizes this codon. The codon on the mRNA and the anticodon on the tRNA bind to each other through complementary base pairing. The rules for base pairing in RNA are:\n- Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U).\n- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C).\n\nThe two strands (codon and anticodon) also align in an antiparallel fashion. This means that the 5' end of one strand aligns with the 3' end of the other.\n\nLet's write down the mRNA codon and determine its complementary, antiparallel anticodon:\n\nmRNA codon: 5' - A U G - 3'\n\nTo find the anticodon sequence, we pair each base and reverse the directionality:\n- The base complementary to A (at the 5' end of the codon) is U. This U will be at the 3' end of the anticodon.\n- The base complementary to U (in the middle of the codon) is A. This A will be in the middle of the anticodon.\n- The base complementary to G (at the 3' end of the codon) is C. This C will be at the 5' end of the anticodon.\n\nSo, the anticodon sequence, when aligned with the codon, is:\n\nmRNA codon:   5' - A U G - 3'\ntRNA anticodon: 3' - U A C - 5'\n\nThe question asks for the anticodon sequence to be written in the standard 5' to 3' direction. To do this, we read the sequence 3'-UAC-5' from the 5' end to the 3' end. This gives us the sequence 5'-CAU-3'.\n\nNow we compare this result with the given options:\nA. 5'-AUG-3' is the codon itself, not the anticodon.\nB. 5'-GUA-3' is the reverse of the codon, not the complement.\nC. 5'-UAC-3' is the complementary sequence but ignores the antiparallel nature of the strands. This would be a parallel alignment, which is incorrect.\nD. 5'-CAU-3' is the correct complementary and antiparallel sequence, written in the standard 5' to 3' direction.\nE. 5'-CAT-3' incorrectly uses Thymine (T) instead of Uracil (U). Thymine is found in DNA, not RNA.\n\nTherefore, the correct anticodon sequence is 5'-CAU-3'.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2102413"}, {"introduction": "While the genetic code is typically read with remarkable fidelity, the concept of a \"reading frame\" is crucial, and the cell's machinery is not infallible.
