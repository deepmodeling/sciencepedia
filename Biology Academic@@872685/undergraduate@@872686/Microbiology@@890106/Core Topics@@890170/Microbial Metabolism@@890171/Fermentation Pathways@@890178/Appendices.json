The cleavage is between the original glucose C-3 and C-4. The original glucose C-1 goes into the DHAP fragment and specifically becomes DHAP C-3 (the phosphate-bearing carbon).\n2) Triose phosphate isomerase converts DHAP to GAP without scrambling the carbon order, so DHAP C-3 becomes GAP C-3. Therefore the original glucose C-1 is now GAP C-3.\n3) The sequence GAP $\\to$ 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate $\\to$ 3-phosphoglycerate $\\to$ 2-phosphoglycerate $\\to$ phosphoenolpyruvate $\\to$ pyruvate preserves the carbon skeleton ordering; thus GAP C-3 becomes pyruvate C-3 (the methyl carbon).\n4) Pyruvate decarboxylase removes the carboxyl carbon (pyruvate C-1) as $\\text{CO}_{2}$ and converts the remaining C-2 and C-3 into acetaldehyde, which is reduced to ethanol:\n$$\\text{Pyruvate}(C\\text{-}1,C\\text{-}2,C\\text{-}3) \\to \\text{CO}_{2}(C\\text{-}1) + \\text{Acetaldehyde}(C\\text{-}2,C\\text{-}3)\\to \\text{Ethanol}(C\\text{-}2,C\\text{-}3).$$\nSince the labeled carbon from glucose C-1 is at pyruvate C-3, it becomes the methyl carbon of ethanol. Therefore, alcoholic fermentation from glucose labeled at C-1 yields $^{14}\\text{C}$ in ethanol, not in $\\text{CO}_{2}$.\n\nHeterolactic fermentation via the pentose phosphate (phosphoketolase) pathway:\n1) The oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway converts glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate and then to ribulose-5-phosphate with the release of one $\\text{CO}_{2}$ by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The decarboxylation specifically releases the original C-1 of glucose as $\\text{CO}_{2}$:\n$$\\text{G6P}(C\\text{-}1\\ \\text{labeled}) \\to \\text{6PG} \\to \\text{Ru5P} + \\text{CO}_{2}(\\text{from }C\\text{-}1).$$\n2) The remaining five-carbon sugar phosphate is cleaved by phosphoketolase into a three-carbon unit (to lactate) and a two-carbon unit (to ethanol). Because the labeled C-1 has already been lost as $\\text{CO}_{2}$, the lactate and ethanol produced are unlabeled, while the $\\text{CO}_{2}$ is labeled.\n\nCombining these, alcoholic fermentation yields $^{14}\\text{C}$-labeled ethanol, and heterolactic fermentation yields $^{14}\\text{C}$-labeled $\\text{CO}_{2}$.
