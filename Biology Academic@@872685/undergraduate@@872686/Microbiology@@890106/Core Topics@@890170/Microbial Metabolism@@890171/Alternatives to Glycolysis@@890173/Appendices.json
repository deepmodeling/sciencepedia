This pathway is distinct from both the standard glycolytic pathway and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.\n\nConsider the catabolism of two molecules of glucose via this pathway. The process can be summarized by the following key transformations:\n1.  Two molecules of glucose are phosphorylated to form two molecules of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P).\n2.
