This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario where an algaecide inhibits Photosystem II, tasking you with deducing the cascading effects on the production of oxygen, ATP, and NADPH.

Both the production of oxygen and the synthesis of NADPH will cease.\n\nE. The production of oxygen will cease, but the synthesis of ATP and NADPH will continue at a reduced rate by using an alternative electron donor from the cytoplasm.", "solution": "We analyze the light-dependent reactions as a coupled electron transport and chemiosmotic system. In oxygenic photosynthesis under linear electron flow, electrons move from water through Photosystem II (PSII), the plastoquinone (PQ) pool, cytochrome b_{6}f, plastocyanin, Photosystem I (PSI), ferredoxin, and finally reduce NADP^{+} to NADPH. The overall donor and acceptor are described by the Z-scheme: water is oxidized at the PSII oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), and NADP^{+} is reduced at ferredoxin-NADP^{+} reductase (FNR). The key reactions include:\n$$\n2\\ \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightarrow O_{2} + 4\\ \\text{H}^{+}_{\\text{lumen}} + 4\\ e^{-} \\quad \\text{(water oxidation at PSII OEC)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{NADP}^{+} + \\text{H}^{+}_{\\text{stroma}} + 2\\ e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{NADPH} \\quad \\text{(reduction by FNR at PSI acceptor side)}\n$$\nProton motive force drives ATP synthase, with the chemiosmotic relation\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{2.303RT}{F}\\Delta \\text{pH},\n$$\nand the ATP synthesis flux depends on the lumenal proton accumulation generated by PSII water oxidation and the Q-cycle at cytochrome b_{6}f when PQH_{2} is oxidized.\n\nThe algaecide specifically blocks electron transfer from pheophytin (the primary PSII acceptor) to the quinone acceptors (Q_{A}/Q_{B}). The normal acceptor-side sequence in PSII is\n$P680^{\\ast} \\rightarrow \\text{pheophytin}^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Q}_{A}^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Q}_{B}^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{PQ} \\rightarrow \\text{PQH}_{2}$.\nIf the step $\\text{pheophytin}^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Q}_{A}$ is inhibited, the electron cannot enter the Q_{A}/Q_{B}/PQ chain. This causes rapid charge recombination between $\\text{pheophytin}^{-}$ and $\\text{P}680^{+}$, so there is no net stable charge separation at PSII and no net reduction of Q_{A}/Q_{B}/PQ. Consequently:\n1) Oxygen evolution ceases. The OEC advances through S-states only when successive stable oxidations of the PSII donor side occur following successful forward electron transfer to the acceptor side. With acceptor-side blockage and consequent recombination, the OEC cannot proceed to release $O_{2}$; thus the reaction $2\\ \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightarrow O_{2} + 4\\ \\text{H}^{+}_{\\text{lumen}} + 4\\ e^{-}$ is effectively halted, and $O_{2}$ production stops.\n2) NADPH synthesis ceases. PSI requires a supply of electrons delivered via reduced plastocyanin, which is reduced by cytochrome b_{6}f receiving electrons from PQH_{2}. Since $\\text{PQH}_{2}$ is not formed when PSII cannot reduce Q_{A}/Q_{B}/PQ, the PQ pool becomes oxidized, cytochrome b_{6}f turnover stops, plastocyanin becomes oxidized, and PSI cannot sustain reduction of ferredoxin to drive\n$\\text{NADP}^{+} + \\text{H}^{+} + 2 e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{NADPH}$.\nAny transient NADPH formation rapidly ceases as donor pools are exhausted.\n3) ATP synthesis via linear electron flow collapses because both proton sources to the lumen are lost: (i) protons released by water oxidation at PSII and (ii) protons translocated/introduced to the lumen during the Q-cycle at cytochrome b_{6}f when $\\text{PQH}_{2}$ is oxidized. The proton motive force $\\Delta p$ therefore drops in the absence of alternative pathways. However, cells can engage cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI, which recycles electrons from ferredoxin back to the PQ/cytochrome b_{6}f complex, generating a proton gradient and ATP without producing $O_{2}$ or NADPH. Thus, while ATP synthesis via CEF may persist or be induced, NADPH synthesis does not occur in CEF.\n\nEvaluating the options under these mechanistic constraints:\n- A is incorrect: a backup of electrons at PSII does not increase the Q-cycle activity or lumenal proton influx; rather, it stops electron flow and diminishes ATP synthesis via linear flow, even though NADPH synthesis indeed ceases.\n- B is incorrect: switching to solely cyclic photophosphorylation stops $O_{2}$ production, but CEF produces ATP only, not NADPH.\n- C is incorrect: NADPH cannot continue unaffected because PSI depends on electrons ultimately supplied by PSII under linear flow; with PSII blocked, NADPH synthesis stops.\n- D is correct: both $O_{2}$ evolution and NADPH synthesis cease as direct and unavoidable consequences of PSII acceptor-side inhibition.\n- E is incorrect: there is no primary, robust alternative cytoplasmic electron donor feeding PSI to sustain significant NADPH synthesis under these conditions; even if minor alternative routes exist, they do not constitute the primary consequence.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that both oxygen production and NADPH synthesis will cease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2084902"}, {"introduction": "Microbial metabolism is not always a simple case of one pathway or another; often, different energy-generating systems are integrated to optimize survival.
