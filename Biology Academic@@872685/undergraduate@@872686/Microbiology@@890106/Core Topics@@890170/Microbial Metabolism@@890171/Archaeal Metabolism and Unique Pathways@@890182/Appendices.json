By analyzing the standard Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway alongside the archaeal semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, you will see firsthand how subtle differences in biochemistry lead to significant energetic consequences.", "problem": "Two different prokaryotic organisms are cultured under identical anaerobic conditions with glucose as the sole carbon and energy source. One is a bacterium, and the other is an archaeon, each utilizing a distinct pathway for glucose glycolysis. Your task is to determine the net yield of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) from a single molecule of glucose for each organism, considering only substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\n**Organism 1: The Bacterium**\nThis bacterium catabolizes glucose using the standard Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway. This pathway can be summarized in two major phases:\n1.  An initial investment phase where 2 molecules of ATP are consumed to activate one molecule of glucose.\n2.  A subsequent payoff phase where the intermediate products are converted to pyruvate, generating a total of 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (reduced form, NADH).\n\n**Organism 2: The Archaeon**\nThis archaeon uses a variant known as the semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. The steps are as follows:\n1.  One molecule of glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate, an activation step which consumes one molecule of ATP.\n2.  Glucose-6-phosphate is then oxidized and cleaved to yield one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). This process also generates one molecule of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (reduced form, NADPH). No ATP is produced or consumed in this cleavage step.\n3.  The single molecule of G3P is subsequently metabolized through a sequence of reactions identical to the payoff phase of the EMP pathway. This conversion of one G3P molecule to pyruvate yields 2 molecules of ATP and 1 molecule of NADH.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, you should not consider any ATP generated from the re-oxidation of NADH or NADPH via an electron transport chain. Calculate the net ATP yield for both the bacterium and the archaeon. Provide two integer values in a single response: first, the net ATP yield for the bacterium, and second, the net ATP yield for the archaeon.", "solution": "We are to compute the net Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) yield per glucose via substrate-level phosphorylation only, explicitly excluding any ATP that could arise from re-oxidation of reduced electron carriers.\n\nFor the bacterium using the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, the relevant principles are:\n- Investment phase consumes 2 ATP to phosphorylate and rearrange glucose to triose phosphates.\n- Payoff phase generates ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation at phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase. Each glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) produces 2 ATP in these steps, and in EMP, one glucose yields 2 G3P.\n\nTherefore, per glucose:\n$$\nATP_{\\text{produced}} = 2 \\, (\\text{ATP per G3P}) \\times 2 \\, (\\text{G3P per glucose}) = 4,\n$$\n$$\nATP_{\\text{consumed}} = 2,\n$$\nso the net ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation is\n$$\nATP_{\\text{net, EMP}} = 4 - 2 = 2.\n$$\nThe production of 2 NADH in the payoff phase is disregarded for ATP accounting here, as oxidative phosphorylation is excluded.\n\nFor the archaeon using the semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the relevant steps are:\n- One ATP is consumed to phosphorylate glucose to glucose-6-phosphate.\n- Oxidative cleavage yields one pyruvate and one G3P, with generation of one NADPH and no ATP produced or consumed in this step.\n- The single G3P proceeds through the EMP-like payoff, yielding 2 ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation and 1 NADH.\n\nTherefore, per glucose:\n$$\nATP_{\\text{produced}} = 2 \\, (\\text{from the single G3P}),\n$$\n$$\nATP_{\\text{consumed}} = 1 \\, (\\text{initial phosphorylation}),\n$$\nso the net ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation is\n$$\nATP_{\\text{net, ED}} = 2 - 1 = 1.\n$$\nAgain, the NADH and NADPH produced are not converted to ATP in this accounting.\n\nThus, the net ATP yields per glucose are $2$ for the bacterium (EMP) and $1$ for the archaeon (semi-phosphorylative ED).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}2 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2054142"}, {"introduction": "Many Archaea thrive in extreme environments by harnessing energy from unique chemical reactions, with methanogenesis being a prime example.

Unlike most methanogens which use the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, this organism uniquely employs the reductive Tricarboxylic Acid (rTCA) cycle for autotrophic carbon fixation. During active growth, the cell synthesizes the amino acid aspartate, a process that requires the withdrawal of oxaloacetate (OAA) from the rTCA cycle.

Since the net rTCA output per turn is acetyl-CoA (a C2 unit), an anaplerotic route must expand a C2 unit to C3 and then to C4 by successive carboxylation steps using $\\text{CO}_2$.\n2) Energetics and redox: Under strict anaerobic conditions with $\\text{H}_2$ as the electron donor, reductive carboxylations are driven by reduced ferredoxin or related low-potential carriers; ATP may be used where needed for unfavorable carboxylation steps.\n3) Substrate limitation: The organism uses only $\\text{H}_2$ and $\\text{CO}_2$ as energy and carbon sources.

Glyoxylate is not provided by $\\text{H}_2$/$\\text{CO}_2$ alone and this route is not the reversal of the oxidative TCA’s final step.

The organism’s sole carbon and energy sources are $\\text{H}_2$ and $\\text{CO}_2$, so this substrate is unavailable, and the proposal is incompatible with the stated physiology.\n- Option C invokes the glyoxylate cycle. The glyoxylate shunt rearranges carbons to assimilate acetyl-CoA without $\\text{CO}_2$ loss but does not fix $\\text{CO}_2$ net; it requires isocitrate lyase and malate synthase and is typically associated with growth on acetate under aerobic or facultative conditions, not strict anaerobic methanogenesis from $\\text{H}_2$/$\\text{CO}_2$.
