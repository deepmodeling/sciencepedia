This exercise explores the critical pathway for presenting antigens from intracellular pathogens, such as viruses. By considering a hypothetical scenario where a key molecular gatekeeper, the TAP transporter, is non-functional, you can deduce the specific consequences for activating the killer arm of the adaptive immune response, the $CD8^+$ T cells. [@problem_id:2224731]", "problem": "A team of immunologists is investigating the mechanisms of cellular immunity against a novel intracellular virus. They utilize a specially engineered line of dendritic cells (DCs), which are professional antigen-presenting cells. This particular DC line carries a loss-of-function mutation in both copies of the gene coding for the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). These TAP-deficient DCs are then infected with the virus in a laboratory setting. Afterwards, the infected DCs are co-cultured with a population of naive T cells isolated from a healthy, uninfected donor.\n\nAssuming the virus behaves as a typical intracellular pathogen and the T cells are fully functional, which of the following outcomes is the most likely result of this co-culture experiment?\n\nA. The TAP-deficient DCs will be unable to activate naive $CD4^+$ T cells.\n\nB. The TAP-deficient DCs will be unable to activate naive $CD8^+$ T cells.\n\nC. The TAP-deficient DCs will show a globally impaired ability to present any type of peptide antigen.\n\nD. The TAP-deficient DCs will activate $CD8^+$ T cells more effectively due to the accumulation of viral proteins in the cytoplasm.\n\nE. Both naive $CD4^+$ and $CD8^+$ T cells will be activated normally, as alternative pathways will compensate for the lack of TAP function.", "solution": "We identify the relevant antigen presentation pathways and the role of TAP, then deduce which naive T cell subsets can be activated by the TAP-deficient dendritic cells (DCs).\n\n1) Principle: The endogenous (cytosolic) antigen presentation pathway to $CD8^+$ T cells requires MHC class I. Cytosolic proteins (including viral proteins from an intracellular pathogen) are degraded by the proteasome into peptides, which must be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP. In the ER, peptides load onto the MHC class I heavy chain and $\\beta_2$-microglobulin, forming stable peptide-MHC class I complexes that traffic to the cell surface for recognition by $CD8^+$ T cells.\n\n2) Consequence of TAP deficiency: If TAP is nonfunctional (loss of function in both alleles), cytosolic peptides are not efficiently transported into the ER. As a result, MHC class I molecules are poorly loaded with peptide, leading to markedly reduced surface expression of stable peptide-MHC class I complexes. Therefore, presentation of intracellular (endogenous) viral antigens to $CD8^+$ T cells is severely impaired. This prevents effective activation (priming) of naive $CD8^+$ T cells, which require specific peptide-MHC class I plus co-stimulation.\n\n3) Principle: The exogenous (endosomal/lysosomal) antigen presentation pathway to $CD4^+$ T cells requires MHC class II and is independent of TAP. Proteins processed in endosomal compartments load onto MHC class II after invariant chain removal and HLA-DM editing. TAP is not involved in peptide transport for MHC class II loading.\n\n4) Consequence for $CD4^+$ T cell activation: Because MHC class II presentation does not require TAP, TAP-deficient DCs retain the ability to present antigens on MHC class II and can, in principle, activate naive $CD4^+$ T cells, provided appropriate co-stimulation is present. While the intracellular location of the virus biases antigens toward the endogenous pathway, DCs can still present antigens on MHC class II via endosomal processing and related routes (for example, autophagy of viral proteins), and, critically, TAP deficiency does not globally impair MHC class II presentation.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because MHC class II presentation to $CD4^+$ T cells is TAP-independent.\n- B is correct because MHC class I presentation of endogenous viral peptides to $CD8^+$ T cells is TAP-dependent and will be markedly impaired, preventing naive $CD8^+$ T cell activation.\n- C is incorrect because the defect is pathway-specific; MHC class II presentation remains intact.\n- D is incorrect because accumulation of viral proteins in the cytosol does not compensate for the lack of TAP; without peptide transport into the ER, MHC class I loading and $CD8^+$ activation are reduced, not enhanced.\n- E is incorrect because TAP-independent alternatives are insufficient to restore normal naive $CD8^+$ T cell activation; the dominant effect is impaired MHC class I antigen presentation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that TAP-deficient DCs will be unable to activate naive $CD8^+$ T cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2224731"}, {"introduction": "The presentation of extracellular antigens via MHC class II is not a simple process; it involves a sophisticated quality control step to ensure a potent and stable immune response. This problem delves into the crucial role of the HLA-DM molecule, which acts as a \"peptide editor,\" swapping out low-affinity placeholders for high-affinity antigenic peptides. By analyzing the consequences of a non-functional HLA-DM, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the molecular precision required to initiate a proper $CD4^+$ T cell response. [@problem_id:2224777]", "problem": "A medical researcher is studying a rare genetic disorder that results in the expression of a non-functional HLA-DM molecule in an individual's antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells. The HLA-DM molecule, a non-classical Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein, normally resides in the endosomal compartments where it interacts with MHC class II molecules. The researcher isolates dendritic cells from this patient and cultures them in a medium containing a high concentration of a purified, soluble protein antigen. After an appropriate incubation period to allow for antigen uptake, processing, and presentation, the researcher analyzes the population of MHC class II molecules on the surface of these dendritic cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected characteristics of the peptide-MHC class II complexes on the surface of these patient-derived dendritic cells compared to those from a healthy individual?\n\nA. A high proportion of MHC class II molecules will be occupied by the CLIP peptide, and the few exogenous peptides that are bound will have a low average binding affinity.\n\nB.

An increased number of MHC class II molecules loaded with a diverse repertoire of high-affinity exogenous peptides will be present on the cell surface.\n\nE. The invariant chain will remain intact and uncleaved, preventing the transport of MHC class II molecules out of the endosomal compartment.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first understand the normal pathway of antigen processing and presentation via Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules, and then analyze the specific role of HLA-DM within this pathway.\n\n**Step 1: The Normal MHC Class II Pathway**\n1.  **Synthesis and Assembly:** MHC class II alpha and beta chains are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To prevent them from binding to the abundant endogenous peptides present in the ER (which are destined for MHC class I), a protein called the invariant chain (Ii) binds to the peptide-binding groove of the newly formed MHC class II molecule. The Ii chain also contains sorting signals that direct the MHC class II-Ii complex from the trans-Golgi network into the endocytic pathway.\n\n2.  **Trafficking and Processing:** The MHC class II-Ii complex travels through the endocytic pathway. Simultaneously, exogenous antigens (like the soluble protein in the problem) are taken up by the dendritic cell into endosomes. These endosomes mature and become increasingly acidic and proteolytically active, forming phagolysosomes.\n\n3.  **Invariant Chain Degradation:** In these acidic compartments (known as MIIC or CIIV), proteases cleave the invariant chain, leaving only a small fragment called the Class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) bound in the MHC class II peptide-binding groove. At this stage, the groove is still blocked.\n\n4.  **The Role of HLA-DM:** The MHC class II-CLIP complex then encounters the HLA-DM molecule. HLA-DM acts as a peptide editor or catalyst. Its functions are twofold:\n    a. It binds to the MHC class II molecule and induces a conformational change that facilitates the release of the CLIP peptide from the binding groove.\n    b. It stabilizes the \"empty\" MHC class II molecule and edits the peptides available in the endosome (derived from the exogenous antigen). It preferentially catalyzes the binding of peptides that form high-affinity, stable interactions with the MHC class II groove, while promoting the dissociation of weakly bound peptides. This ensures that the complexes eventually displayed on the cell surface are stable and can effectively stimulate T cells.\n\n5.  **Surface Expression:** Once a high-affinity peptide is stably bound, the peptide-MHC class II complex is transported to the cell surface for presentation to $CD4^+$ T helper cells.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Scenario with Non-Functional HLA-DM**\nIn the patient described, HLA-DM is non-functional. We can trace the consequences step-by-step:\n\n1.  Steps 1-3 of the pathway (MHC class II synthesis, association with Ii, trafficking, and cleavage of Ii to CLIP) proceed normally. MHC class II molecules bound to CLIP will accumulate in the endosomal compartments.\n\n2.  **Failure of Step 4:** Since HLA-DM is non-functional, it cannot efficiently catalyze the removal of the CLIP peptide from the MHC class II binding groove. The release of CLIP, which is normally a kinetically slow process, will be severely impaired.\n\n3.  **Consequences for Peptide Loading:** Because the groove remains occupied by CLIP in most MHC class II molecules, the loading of peptides derived from the exogenous antigen is extremely inefficient. The diversity of the presented peptide repertoire will be drastically reduced.\n\n4.  **Consequences for Binding Affinity:** The peptide editing function of HLA-DM is lost. In the rare instances where CLIP might spontaneously dissociate and an exogenous peptide binds, there is no mechanism to select for high-affinity binders. Therefore, the few exogenous peptides that manage to bind will be a random assortment, with a low average binding affinity, forming less stable complexes.\n\n5.  **Final State on Cell Surface:** A large fraction of the MHC class II molecules that reach the cell surface will still be bound to the CLIP peptide. The presentation of actual antigenic peptides will be minimal. The few antigenic peptides that are presented will not have been selected for high affinity.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n*   **A. A high proportion of MHC class II molecules will be occupied by the CLIP peptide, and the few exogenous peptides that are bound will have a low average binding affinity.** This statement accurately reflects our analysis. CLIP removal is inhibited, and the peptide editing function that selects for high-affinity binders is absent. This is the correct answer.\n*   **B. MHC class II molecules will fail to be synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to their complete absence from the cell surface.** This is incorrect. HLA-DM acts late in the pathway, in the endosome. It has no role in the synthesis of MHC class II molecules in the ER.\n*   **C. MHC class II molecules will be loaded with a diverse array of high-affinity peptides derived from endogenous, cytosolic proteins.** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, MHC class II molecules present exogenous peptides, not endogenous ones from the cytosol (that is the role of MHC class I). Second, the affinity would be low, not high, due to the lack of HLA-DM's editing function.\n*   **D. An increased number of MHC class II molecules loaded with a diverse repertoire of high-affinity exogenous peptides will be present on the cell surface.** This is the opposite of what would happen. Both the number and diversity of presented exogenous peptides, as well as their affinity, would be dramatically reduced.\n*   **E. The invariant chain will remain intact and uncleaved, preventing the transport of MHC class II molecules out of the endosomal compartment.** This is incorrect. The cleavage of the invariant chain into CLIP is performed by proteases in the endosome and is an event that occurs upstream of HLA-DM's action. The problem is the removal of the *resulting* CLIP fragment, not the cleavage of the *initial* invariant chain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2224777"}, {"introduction": "Moving from molecular mechanisms to cellular outcomes, this practice puts you in the role of an experimental immunologist.
