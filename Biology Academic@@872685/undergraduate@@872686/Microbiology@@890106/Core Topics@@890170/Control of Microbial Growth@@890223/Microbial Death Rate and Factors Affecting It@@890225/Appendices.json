Deriving the point at which resistant survivors outnumber susceptible ones provides deeper insight into the challenges of achieving complete sterility and the importance of advanced kinetic models.", "problem": "The conventional model for microbial disinfection assumes that the death of microorganisms follows first-order kinetics, described by the equation $\\frac{dN}{dt} = -kN$, where $N$ is the number of viable cells and $k$ is a constant death rate. This predicts a linear relationship when the logarithm of the survivor count is plotted against time. However, in many real-world scenarios, a phenomenon known as \"tailing\" is observed, where the death rate decreases significantly over time, resulting in a curve that flattens out at low survivor concentrations.\n\nA common hypothesis to explain this deviation is the existence of population heterogeneity. Consider a model where a microbial culture with a total initial population of $N_0$ cells is not uniform. Instead, it is composed of two distinct subpopulations:\n1. A large \"susceptible\" subpopulation that makes up a fraction $(1 - f_R)$ of the initial culture. These cells are killed with a first-order rate constant $k_S$.\n2. A small \"resistant\" subpopulation that constitutes the remaining fraction $f_R$ of the initial culture. These cells are more robust and are killed with a much smaller first-order rate constant $k_R$, where $k_R < k_S$.\n\nThe tailing effect becomes dominant when the resistant subpopulation, despite its small initial numbers, becomes the majority of the surviving cells. Determine the time, $t_{eq}$, at which the number of viable cells in the susceptible subpopulation equals the number of viable cells in the resistant subpopulation.\n\nYour final answer should be a closed-form analytic expression for $t_{eq}$ in terms of the rate constants $k_S$, $k_R$, and the initial fraction of resistant cells $f_R$.", "solution": "We model each subpopulation with first-order death kinetics.
