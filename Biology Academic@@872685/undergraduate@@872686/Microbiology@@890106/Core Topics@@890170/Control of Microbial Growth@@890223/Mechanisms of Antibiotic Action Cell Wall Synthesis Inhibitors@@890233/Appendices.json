The bacteria are suspended in a nutrient broth that is hypotonic with respect to the bacterial cytoplasm. A bactericidal concentration of penicillin, an antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis, is added to the culture. Assuming the bacteria are susceptible to penicillin, which of the following describes the most likely immediate morphological fate of the majority of the growing cells?\n\nA. The cells will swell due to water influx and ultimately undergo osmotic lysis.\n\nB. The cells will shrink as water leaves the cytoplasm, leading to plasmolysis.\n\nC. The cells will lose their cell walls and transform into stable L-forms, which will continue to replicate.\n\nD. The cells will cease to divide but will otherwise remain morphologically intact for an extended period.\n\nE. The cells will respond to the stress by forming protective endospores.", "solution": "The culture medium is hypotonic relative to the bacterial cytoplasm, so the direction of osmotic water movement is into the cell. In general, water flows from lower effective solute concentration to higher effective solute concentration, generating an inward osmotic gradient. The rigid peptidoglycan cell wall in bacteria normally counters the resulting turgor pressure and prevents swelling and rupture.\n\nPenicillin inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis by blocking transpeptidation catalyzed by penicillin-binding proteins during cell wall assembly. This effect is most pronounced in actively dividing cells that are synthesizing new cell wall. While penicillin does not directly damage the cytoplasmic membrane, it prevents proper cross-linking of peptidoglycan; at the same time, endogenous autolysins continue to remodel the wall. The net effect is a progressive weakening and disruption of wall integrity during growth.\n\nIn a hypotonic environment, once the structural support of the wall is compromised, the cytoplasmic membrane is exposed to unopposed osmotic influx of water. The membrane cannot withstand the high turgor pressure without the rigid wall; as a result, the cells swell and undergo osmotic lysis. This is the characteristic bactericidal action of beta-lactam antibiotics on susceptible Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nAlternative options are inconsistent with the stated conditions:\n- Plasmolysis (cell shrinkage) occurs in hypertonic media, not hypotonic media.\n- Stable L-forms require osmoprotective (isotonic) conditions; in hypotonic broth, wall-deficient forms rapidly lyse rather than persist and replicate.\n- Penicillin is bactericidal rather than merely bacteriostatic; cells do not simply remain morphologically intact for an extended period.\n- Staphylococcus aureus does not form endospores; endospore formation is typical of genera such as Bacillus and Clostridium.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate morphological fate of the majority of growing cells after addition of penicillin in a hypotonic medium is swelling followed by osmotic lysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2077187"}, {"introduction": "Building a bacterial cell wall is a complex, orchestrated process, not a simple act of laying down bricks. Different enzymes, known as Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs), have specialized roles, such as elongating the cell or dividing it in two. This thought experiment asks you to consider the specific morphological outcome when an antibiotic targets only the cell division machinery, helping to illustrate the functional diversity of PBPs and the precise ways antibiotics can disrupt the bacterial life cycle. [@problem_id:2077218]", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a novel antibiotic, \"Divisoblockin,\" for its effect on a rod-shaped bacterium, *Escherichia coli*. The growth and division of *E. coli* are dependent on a set of enzymes known as Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs). These enzymes are responsible for synthesizing the peptidoglycan cell wall. In *E. coli*, PBP2 is primarily involved in cell elongation (adding new peptidoglycan along the lateral walls), while PBP3 is essential for forming the division septum (the cross-wall that separates the two daughter cells).\n\nThe microbiologist performs an experiment where a culture of *E. coli* in its exponential growth phase is treated with a concentration of Divisoblockin that is sufficient to specifically and completely inhibit the function of PBP3, while having no discernible effect on PBP2 or any other cellular processes. Assuming the bacteria are in a nutrient-rich broth that supports continuous growth, which of the following describes the most likely morphological change observed in the bacterial population after several hours of exposure to Divisoblockin?\n\nA. The bacteria will swell into spherical forms and eventually lyse.\n\nB. The bacteria will fail to elongate and will appear as abnormally short rods.\n\nC. The bacteria will grow into long, continuous filaments without any dividing septa.\n\nD. The bacteria will immediately die and lyse due to a complete failure of the cell wall.\n\nE. The bacteria will show no change in morphology but will cease all metabolic activity.", "solution": "We identify the relevant biological roles. In rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli, peptidoglycan synthesis is partitioned functionally among Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs). PBP2 is required for lateral wall elongation during cell growth, whereas PBP3 (also known as FtsI) is the septal transpeptidase essential for synthesizing the division septum during cytokinesis.\n\nGiven the experimental condition: Divisoblockin specifically and completely inhibits PBP3 function while leaving PBP2 and other processes intact, and the cells are in nutrient-rich conditions that support ongoing biosynthesis. Therefore:\n1. Septal peptidoglycan synthesis is blocked because PBP3 activity is required for septation. This prevents formation of the cross-wall and thus prevents cell division.\n2. Lateral wall elongation continues because PBP2 is unaffected, so the cells continue to synthesize peptidoglycan along their sidewalls and elongate.\n3. Metabolic activity, DNA replication, and growth are maintained by the nutrient-rich conditions and absence of off-target effects.\n\nThe logical morphological consequence is filamentation: cells elongate continuously without division, producing long, multinucleate filaments that lack septa.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because swelling into spheres is characteristic of inhibiting PBP2 (loss of rod shape, spherical transformation, as seen with mecillinam), not PBP3, and lysis is not expected with specific PBP3 inhibition under these conditions.\n- B is incorrect because failure to elongate is specifically due to PBP2 inhibition, which is not occurring here.\n- C is correct because inhibition of PBP3 blocks septation while elongation proceeds via PBP2, leading to long filaments without septa.\n- D is incorrect because immediate death and lysis would require a catastrophic failure of essential cell wall synthesis globally (e.g., inhibition of PBPs critical for both elongation and maintenance), which is not the case here.\n- E is incorrect because morphology changes significantly (filamentation), and metabolic activity continues per the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the most likely morphological change is the formation of long, continuous filaments with no dividing septa.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2077218"}, {"introduction": "In a clinical setting, understanding how bacteria respond to antibiotics goes beyond a simple \"susceptible\" or \"resistant\" label.

An initial isolate, labeled **Isolate 1**, was recovered before treatment with the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. After an initial improvement, the patient relapsed, and a second isolate, **Isolate 2**, was recovered. To understand the change in the bacterium's behavior, a detailed susceptibility analysis was performed on both isolates using vancomycin.\n\nFirst, a broth microdilution test was conducted to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), the lowest drug concentration that prevents visible bacterial growth. A standardized inoculum of each isolate was added to a series of wells containing two-fold dilutions of vancomycin. The results after 24 hours of incubation are shown below, where '+' indicates turbidity (growth) and '−' indicates no visible growth.\n\n**MIC Test Results:**\n| Vancomycin (µg/mL) | 0 (Control) | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | 128 |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Isolate 1** | + | + | − | − | − | − | − | − | − | − |\n| **Isolate 2** | + | + | − | − | − | − | − | − | − | − |\n\nNext, to determine the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), an aliquot from each clear well (i.e., concentrations at and above the MIC) was plated onto antibiotic-free agar.
