However, resistance isn't always a free lunch for the bacterium; it can come with a fitness cost that makes the resistant strain less competitive in other ways. This thought experiment uses a mathematical model to explore such a trade-off, where bacteria gain phage resistance at the cost of motility, affecting their ability to reach a nutrient source. By analyzing this scenario, you'll develop a quantitative understanding of the co-evolutionary dynamics that can influence therapeutic outcomes [@problem_id:2084490].", "problem": "In a study of pathogen-phage coevolution, two strains of a bacterium are cultured in a liquid medium. The first strain, Strain S (Susceptible), is the wild-type, possessing a flagellum that enables motility. This flagellum also serves as the primary receptor for a lytic bacteriophage. The second strain, Strain R (Resistant), is a mutant that has lost its flagellum. Consequently, Strain R is non-motile but is completely resistant to infection by the phage.\n\nThe experiment is conducted in a long, thin tube. At time $t=0$, both strains are inoculated at one end of the tube ($x=0$), each with an initial population of $N_0$. A static, localized source of a limiting nutrient is located at a distance $L$ from the inoculation point. The nutrient concentration profile creates two distinct zones for bacterial growth:\n- For any position $x < L$, the nutrient level supports a specific growth rate of $\\mu_{min}$.\n- For any position $x \\ge L$, the nutrient level is richer and supports a specific growth rate of $\\mu_{max}$.\n\nThe motile Strain S exhibits positive chemotaxis, moving towards the nutrient source with an average net drift velocity of $v_d$. The non-motile Strain R remains localized at $x=0$. The lytic bacteriophage is distributed uniformly throughout the entire tube and causes lysis of the susceptible Strain S with a constant first-order rate constant $\\lambda$. Strain R is unaffected by the phage.\n\nAssuming the experiment runs for a total time $T$, which is greater than the time required for Strain S to reach the nutrient source (i.e., $T > L/v_d$), derive a symbolic expression for the ratio of the final population of the resistant strain to that of the susceptible strain, $N_R(T)/N_S(T)$.", "solution": "Let $t_{L}$ denote the time for Strain S to reach the nutrient source at $x=L$.
