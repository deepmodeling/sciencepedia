While high-throughput technologies dominate genomics today, Sanger sequencing remains the gold standard for validating sequences and analyzing smaller DNA regions.

The process involves a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) where the four standard deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are supplemented with a small amount of four different fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs). Each ddNTP is tagged with a unique dye that emits light at a specific wavelength upon laser excitation. The correspondence is as follows:\n\n-   ddATP is labeled with a green dye.\n-   ddTTP is labeled with a red dye.\n-   ddGTP is labeled with a yellow dye.\n-   ddCTP is labeled with a blue dye.\n\nAfter the reaction, the resulting DNA fragments are separated by size via capillary electrophoresis. A detector records the fluorescence signals as the fragments pass by, ordered from smallest to largest. The output from the automated sequencer is a text-based list of detected fluorescence peaks, ordered by elution time (earliest first). Below are the entries for the first eight detected signals.\n\n-   **Signal 1:** Time = 20.1 min, Dye = Mixed, Relative Intensity = 980, Automated Call = N\n-   **Signal 2:** Time = 22.3 min, Dye = Yellow, Relative Intensity = 875, Automated Call = G\n-   **Signal 3:** Time = 23.4 min, Dye = Blue, Relative Intensity = 850, Automated Call = C\n-   **Signal 4:** Time = 24.5 min, Dye = Red, Relative Intensity = 860, Automated Call = T\n-   **Signal 5:** Time = 24.7 min, Dye = Green, Relative Intensity = 55, Automated Call = A\n-   **Signal 6:** Time = 25.6 min, Dye = Yellow, Relative Intensity = 810, Automated Call = G\n-   **Signal 7:** Time = 26.7 min, Dye = Blue, Relative Intensity = 790, Automated Call = C\n-   **Signal 8:** Time = 27.8 min, Dye = Red, Relative Intensity = 845, Automated Call = T\n\nBased on the raw signal data and your understanding of Sanger sequencing principles and common artifacts, determine the correct sequence of the first five bases of the newly synthesized DNA strand, read in the 5' to 3' direction.

The resulting fragments differ by one nucleotide in length and are separated by capillary electrophoresis; shorter fragments elute earlier. The detector records fluorescence, and the dye color identifies the terminating base. Thus, reading the ordered peaks from earliest to latest gives the newly synthesized strand sequence in the 5' to 3' direction, one base per peak.\n\nThe dye-to-base mapping provided is:\n- Green: A (ddATP)\n- Red: T (ddTTP)\n- Yellow: G (ddGTP)\n- Blue: C (ddCTP)\n\nCommon artifacts must be accounted for:\n- A “Mixed” dye peak, especially very early and called as N, typically represents a dye blob or primer-associated artifact and should be excluded from the base call.\n- A very low-intensity peak, especially one that is narrowly spaced from a neighboring strong peak, often represents noise or spectral pull-up rather than a true base incorporation. Here, typical real peaks have relative intensities around 790–875, while the suspicious peak is only 55.\n\nProcess the signals in order of elution (earliest to latest), excluding artifacts:\n- Signal 1 (Mixed, N, very early, intensity 980): mixed dye blob artifact → exclude.\n- Signal 2 (Yellow, G, 875): valid first base → G.\n- Signal 3 (Blue, C, 850): valid second base → C.\n- Signal 4 (Red, T, 860): valid third base → T.\n- Signal 5 (Green, A, 55): intensity is far below neighboring peaks and occurs only 0.2 min after the prior strong peak, consistent with noise/pull-up → exclude as artifact.\n- Signal 6 (Yellow, G, 810): valid next base → G.\n- Signal 7 (Blue, C, 790): valid next base → C.\n- Signal 8 (Red, T, 845): next valid base, not needed for the first five positions.\n\nTherefore, the first five bases of the newly synthesized DNA strand, read 5' to 3', are taken from Signals 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7:\nG, C, T, G, C.\n\nHence, the correct five-base sequence is GCTGC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{GCTGC}$$", "id": "2062747"}, {"introduction": "Whether using classic Sanger sequencing or modern next-generation platforms, the output is a collection of short, fragmented DNA \"reads.\" A central challenge in genomics is to piece these fragments back together to reconstruct the original, long DNA molecule.

This merges to A followed by E with the overlap collapsed: A + E gives `ACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCG`.\n- Read E ends with AAATTGCG, and read B begins with AAATTGCG, so E overlaps B on the length-$8$ suffix/prefix AAATTGCG. Extending the previous merge, A + E + B gives `ACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG`.\n- Read D ends with ACGTACGT, and read A begins with ACGTACGT, so D overlaps A on the length-$8$ suffix/prefix ACGTACGT. Thus D + (A + E + B) gives `GATTACACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG`.\n- Read C ends with GATTACA, and read D begins with GATTACA, so C overlaps D on the length-$7$ suffix/prefix GATTACA. Prepending C yields the full assembly: C + D + A + E + B equals `GATTACAGATTACACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG`.\n\nVerification by length accounting: the total of individual lengths is $14 + 14 + 14 + 14 + 15 = 71$, and the overlaps contribute $7 + 8 + 6 + 8 = 29$, so the assembled contig length is $71 - 29 = 42$, matching the length of `GATTACAGATTACACGTACGTGGGGCTAAATTGCGTAGCTAG`.
