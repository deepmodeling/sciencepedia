Three different plasmids are designed. Each plasmid contains a gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), but under the control of a different constitutive promoter: $P_A$, $P_B$, and $P_C$. The \"strength\" of these promoters is well-characterized and quantified in Relative Promoter Units (RPU), which provides a standardized measure of a promoter's transcription initiation rate compared to a reference promoter.\n\nThe strengths of the three promoters are:\n- Promoter $P_A$: $S_A = 1.80$ RPU\n- Promoter $P_B$: $S_B = 0.950$ RPU\n- Promoter $P_C$: $S_C = 4.30$ RPU\n\nThree separate cultures of *E. coli* are transformed, one with each plasmid construct. You can assume that for all three constructs, the plasmid copy number is the same, and all other genetic parts (such as the Ribosome Binding Site and the terminator) are identical. The cultures are grown under identical conditions until they reach a steady-state concentration of GFP.\n\nIn this simplified model, assume the following:\n1. The steady-state concentration of GFP in a cell is directly proportional to the strength of the promoter driving its expression.\n2. The total fluorescence measured from a culture is directly proportional to the steady-state concentration of GFP within the cells.\n\nCalculate two values: first, the fluorescence of the culture containing promoter $P_B$ relative to the culture with $P_A$; and second, the fluorescence of the culture containing promoter $P_C$ relative to the culture with $P_A$.

It consists of three genes and their corresponding protein products, which we will call Protein A, Protein B, and Protein C.

Therefore the long-term behavior must be a steady state or monotone divergence in $B$ coupled to the induced responses of $A$ and $C$.\n\nConsider the asymptotic possibilities for $B$:\n- If the promoter for *geneB* can be fully repressed (no basal expression) so that $f_{B}(A)=0$ for sufficiently large $A$, then $B$ increases initially (while $A$ is still low), and once $A$ becomes large enough, $\\dot{B}=0$, so $B$ freezes at some finite $B_{\\infty}>0$.\n- If there is unavoidable basal expression so that $f_{B}(A)\\ge b_{B}>0$ for all $A$, then $\\dot{B}\\ge b_{B}$ and $B(t)\\to\\infty$.\n\nIn either case, $B$ eventually becomes and remains high (finite high or diverging).
