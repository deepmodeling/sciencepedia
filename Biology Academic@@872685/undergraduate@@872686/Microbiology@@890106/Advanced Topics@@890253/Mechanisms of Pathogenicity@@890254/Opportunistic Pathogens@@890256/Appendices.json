The hypothesis is that Species A enhances the pathogenicity of Species B by providing a key metabolic precursor, which we will call Factor P. Species B uses Factor P to synthesize a potent exotoxin, its primary Virulence Factor (VF).\n\nThe rate of VF synthesis per cell of Species B, denoted by $v_{VF}$, is found to follow a saturation-kinetic model dependent on the local concentration of Factor P, $[P]$:\n$$v_{VF} = V_{max} \\frac{[P]}{K_m + [P]}$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximum synthesis rate and $K_m$ is a concentration constant.\n\nThe researcher conducts two experiments in a bioreactor under identical conditions (temperature, pH, nutrient medium), ensuring the population density of Species B remains constant in both setups.\n\n1.  **Monoculture experiment**: A biofilm of only Species B is grown.
