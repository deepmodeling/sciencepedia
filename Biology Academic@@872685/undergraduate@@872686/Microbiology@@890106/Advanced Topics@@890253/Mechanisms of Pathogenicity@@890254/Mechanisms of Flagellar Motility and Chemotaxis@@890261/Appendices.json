The characteristic \"random walk\" of bacteria like *E. coli* is not arbitrary but is built from two distinct behaviors: smooth, straight \"runs\" and abrupt, reorienting \"tumbles.\" This first exercise explores the fundamental link between the direction of flagellar rotation and these macroscopic movements, providing a crucial foundation for all subsequent concepts [@problem_id:2078304]. By considering a mutant unable to switch its motor's direction, you can solidify your understanding of how physical rotation translates into cellular motion.", "problem": "In many motile bacteria, such as *Escherichia coli*, movement is achieved through the rotation of flagella distributed over the cell surface, a configuration known as peritrichous flagellation. The cell's movement pattern, often described as a \"random walk,\" is composed of two distinct modes. The first mode is a \"run,\" where the flagella rotate in a counter-clockwise (CCW) direction. This synchronized rotation causes the individual flagella to form a cohesive bundle that acts as a propeller, driving the cell forward in a relatively straight line. The second mode is a \"tumble,\" where the direction of flagellar rotation reverses to clockwise (CW). This change causes the flagellar bundle to fly apart, and the uncoordinated motion of the individual flagella causes the cell to stop and randomly reorient itself in space. By alternating between runs and tumbles, the bacterium can explore its environment.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of such a bacterium. This strain has a genetic defect in its flagellar motor switch complex, which results in the flagella being permanently locked in a state of counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation. They are unable to switch to a clockwise (CW) rotation.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected motility pattern of this mutant bacterium?\n\nA. The bacterium will be completely non-motile, as the inability to switch rotational direction prevents any form of propulsion.\n\nB. The bacterium will be stuck in a state of continuous tumbling, randomly spinning in place without making significant forward progress.\n\nC. The bacterium will exhibit a pattern of long, smooth \"runs\" but will be unable to execute \"tumbles\" to change its direction.\n\nD. The bacterium will move in a normal \"run-and-tumble\" pattern, indistinguishable from a wild-type cell.\n\nE. The bacterium will only be able to swim in reverse, as the flagellar bundle will form improperly.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires a fundamental understanding of bacterial motility through flagellar rotation. We must analyze the consequence of the mutant's specific limitation.\n\nFirst, let's review the two standard modes of movement in a wild-type peritrichous bacterium.\n1.  **Run:** This is a phase of directional movement. It is caused by the counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation of all flagella. This specific rotation direction allows the individual flagellar filaments to come together and form a single, rotating bundle that functions like a ship's propeller, pushing the bacterium forward.\n2.  **Tumble:** This is a phase of reorientation. It is caused by a switch in the motor to clockwise (CW) rotation. The CW rotation disrupts the flagellar bundle, causing the filaments to fly apart and rotate independently. This creates a chaotic, uncoordinated force that stops the cell's forward motion and causes it to reorient randomly.\n\nThe problem states that the mutant bacterium has its flagella locked in the counter-clockwise (CCW) rotational state. This means the bacterium can perform the action associated with CCW rotation but cannot perform the action associated with CW rotation.\n\nBased on our review, CCW rotation is the direct cause of the \"run\" phase. The flagella will form a bundle and propel the cell forward. Therefore, the bacterium is fully capable of motility and will be able to \"run.\"\n\nHowever, the \"tumble\" phase is entirely dependent on the ability to switch to CW rotation. Since the mutant is incapable of CW rotation, its flagellar bundle can never be made to fly apart. Consequently, the bacterium can never \"tumble\" and reorient itself.\n\nCombining these two points, the mutant bacterium will be stuck in a permanent \"run\" mode. It will swim forward continuously in long, smooth paths. While minor directional changes might occur due to Brownian motion or collisions, the bacterium lacks the intrinsic biological mechanism to purposefully stop and change its direction.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\nA. The bacterium will be completely non-motile. This is incorrect. The CCW rotation still generates propulsive force, so the bacterium will be motile.\nB. The bacterium will be stuck in a state of continuous tumbling. This is incorrect. Tumbling is caused by CW rotation, which the mutant cannot perform.\nC. The bacterium will exhibit a pattern of long, smooth \"runs\" but will be unable to execute \"tumbles\" to change its direction. This accurately describes the consequence of being locked in the CCW \"run\" mode.\nD. The bacterium will move in a normal \"run-and-tumble\" pattern. This is incorrect. The inability to tumble makes its movement pattern fundamentally different from a wild-type cell.\nE. The bacterium will only be able to swim in reverse. This is incorrect. For peritrichous bacteria like *E. coli*, CCW rotation of the bundled flagella results in forward, not reverse, motion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2078304"}, {"introduction": "Having established the mechanical basis of runs and tumbles, the next logical question is: how does the cell *decide* when to switch between these two states? The answer lies in a sophisticated intracellular signaling pathway that senses the chemical environment. This practice focuses on the central role of the sensor kinase protein, CheA, which acts as the master switch in this circuit [@problem_id:2078275]. By predicting the behavior of a cell lacking this critical protein, you will probe the logic of the chemotaxis pathway and its default operational state.", "problem": "In peritrichously flagellated bacteria such as *Escherichia coli*, movement is characterized by an alternation between two distinct behaviors: a \"run\" and a \"tumble\". A run is a period of smooth, directed swimming caused by the counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation of the flagellar filaments, which allows them to form a cohesive bundle that propels the cell forward. A tumble is a brief, erratic reorientation caused by the clockwise (CW) rotation of the flagella, which causes the bundle to fly apart.\n\nThis switching is controlled by an intracellular signaling pathway. In the absence of a chemical attractant, a sensor kinase protein, CheA, undergoes autophosphorylation. This phosphorylated CheA then transfers its phosphate group to a response regulator protein, CheY. The phosphorylated form of CheY, denoted as CheY-P, is the species that interacts with the flagellar motor's switch complex. The binding of CheY-P to the motor induces a switch from the motor's default CCW rotation to CW rotation, thereby causing a tumble.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that has undergone a complete gene deletion for the *cheA* gene, resulting in a total absence of the CheA protein. Which of the following options best describes the resulting motility phenotype of this mutant bacterium?\n\nA. The bacterium will be constantly tumbling.\n\nB. The bacterium will be non-motile (unable to move at all).\n\nC. The bacterium will exhibit constant, smooth running with no tumbling.\n\nD. The bacterium will be motile but will show a reversed chemotactic response, moving away from attractants and towards repellents.\n\nE. The bacterium will alternate between runs and tumbles, but the frequency of tumbling will be significantly higher than in a wild-type cell.", "solution": "We use the known chemotaxis signaling logic in peritrichously flagellated bacteria: the default flagellar motor state is counter-clockwise (CCW), which produces a run, and binding of phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P) to the motor increases clockwise (CW) bias, producing tumbles.\n\nDeletion of the *cheA* gene implies the total absence of CheA protein, so we set $[\\mathrm{CheA}]=0$.\n\nThe CheA autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer steps are:\n$$\\mathrm{CheA} \\to \\mathrm{CheA\\text{-}P}, \\quad \\mathrm{CheA\\text{-}P} + \\mathrm{CheY} \\to \\mathrm{CheA} + \\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P}$$\nWith $[\\mathrm{CheA}]=0$, the production of $\\mathrm{CheA\\text{-}P}$ is zero:\n$$\\frac{d[\\mathrm{CheA\\text{-}P}]}{dt} = k_{a}[\\mathrm{CheA}] - \\cdots = 0$$\nThis means $[\\mathrm{CheA\\text{-}P}]=0$ at all times. Consequently, the CheY phosphorylation flux ($v_{\\mathrm{Y,phos}}$) is also zero:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{Y,phos}} = k_{t}[\\mathrm{CheA\\text{-}P}][\\mathrm{CheY}] = 0$$\nCheY-P is continuously dephosphorylated (e.g., by the phosphatase CheZ and through intrinsic hydrolysis), a process described by the reaction $\\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P} \\to \\mathrm{CheY}$, with a rate of $v_{\\mathrm{Y,dephos}} = k_{z}[\\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P}]$.\nAt steady state, setting production equal to loss gives:\n$$0 - k_{z}[\\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P}] = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad [\\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P}]=0$$\n\nThe motor's CW bias, $P_{\\mathrm{CW}}$, is an increasing function of the concentration of CheY-P, $f([\\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P}])$, where $\\frac{df}{d[\\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P}]} > 0$. Since $[\\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P}] \\approx 0$, the CW probability is minimal ($P_{\\mathrm{CW}} \\approx 0$). The motor therefore remains in its default CCW state, producing smooth runs without any tumbles.\n\nTherefore, the *cheA* deletion mutant is motile but exhibits constant, smooth running with no tumbling, which corresponds to option C. Options A and E require elevated $[\\mathrm{CheY\\text{-}P}]$, which cannot occur without CheA; option B is incorrect because the flagellar motors still rotate CCW in the absence of CheY-P; option D requires signal processing and CheY-P modulation that are abolished without CheA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2078275"}, {"introduction": "A bacterium rarely encounters a single chemical signal in isolation; its world is a complex mixture of attractants and repellents.

The sensor relies on a modified chemoreceptor complex that modulates the activity of a kinase, CheA.

The entire receptor-kinase complex can be effectively modeled as a two-state system, existing in either an 'active' or 'inactive' conformational state. The kinase activity is directly proportional to the probability of the complex being in the active state, $P_{active}$, according to the relation $A_{CheA} = A_{max} \\cdot P_{active}$.\n\nThe thermodynamics of the complex are described by the following quantitative model.
