This practice uses a classic thought experiment involving the enzyme lysozyme to probe the structural differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell walls. By predicting the outcome of enzymatic digestion [@problem_id:2078883], you will reinforce your knowledge of why these two major classes of bacteria are fundamentally distinct and how their structures relate to their survival.", "problem": "A microbiology student is conducting an experiment to study bacterial cell wall structures. The student takes two cultures of bacteria, one known to be Gram-positive and the other Gram-negative. Both cultures are suspended in an isotonic sucrose solution. The student then adds lysozyme, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the $\\beta(1-4)$ glycosidic bonds in peptidoglycan, to both suspensions. After incubation, the Gram-positive bacteria are converted into protoplasts, and the Gram-negative bacteria are converted into spheroplasts.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly distinguishes the resulting protoplast from the spheroplast?\n\nA. Both the protoplast and the spheroplast are completely devoid of a plasma membrane.\n\nB. The protoplast has its plasma membrane and a thin, residual layer of peptidoglycan, while the spheroplast has only its plasma membrane.\n\nC. The spheroplast retains the outer membrane and the plasma membrane, whereas the protoplast retains only the plasma membrane.\n\nD. Protoplasts are derived from Gram-negative bacteria, while spheroplasts are derived from Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nE. Both structures are osmotically stable in a hypotonic solution due to the remaining components of their cell envelopes.", "solution": "Lysozyme hydrolyzes the $\\beta(1-4)$ glycosidic bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine in peptidoglycan, thereby removing or greatly weakening the cell wall. In an isotonic sucrose solution, osmotic lysis is prevented, allowing cell wall-deficient forms to persist.\n\nGram-positive bacteria possess a thick peptidoglycan layer and lack an outer membrane. When lysozyme removes this peptidoglycan, the resulting entity retains only the cytoplasmic (plasma) membrane and intracellular contents; this structure is called a protoplast.\n\nGram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer located in the periplasm between the inner (plasma) membrane and an outer membrane. Lysozyme hydrolyzes the peptidoglycan, but the outer membrane is not removed by lysozyme alone. Thus, the resulting structure retains the outer membrane and the plasma membrane, often with little to no peptidoglycan; this is called a spheroplast.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because both forms retain the plasma membrane; loss of the plasma membrane would be lethal and is not the definition of either structure.\n- B is false because the protoplast lacks peptidoglycan, while the spheroplast retains the outer membrane; the statement reverses the features.\n- C is correct: the spheroplast retains both outer and plasma membranes, whereas the protoplast retains only the plasma membrane.\n- D is false: protoplasts typically derive from Gram-positive bacteria; spheroplasts from Gram-negative.\n- E is false: both are osmotically fragile and would lyse in a hypotonic solution; isotonic sucrose is used to prevent lysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct distinguishing statement is that the spheroplast retains the outer membrane and the plasma membrane, whereas the protoplast retains only the plasma membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2078883"}, {"introduction": "The Gram stain is a cornerstone diagnostic tool in microbiology, but interpreting its results requires more than just memorizing colors. This exercise [@problem_id:2078891] presents a realistic scenario where a pure, Gram-positive culture yields mixed results, challenging you to move beyond textbook examples. By diagnosing this common anomaly, you will develop critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of the relationship between bacterial physiology, cell wall integrity, and the chemical principles of this essential staining procedure.", "problem": "A microbiology student is tasked with performing a Gram stain on a pure culture of *Bacillus subtilis*, which is known to be a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium. The student uses a culture that is two weeks old. Following the standard Gram stain procedure, the student observes the slide under the microscope and is surprised to see a mixture of purple, rod-shaped cells and pink, rod-shaped cells. Assuming the student performed the staining procedure correctly and the original culture was indeed pure, what is the most likely explanation for this observation?\n\nA. In the aging culture, many cells have entered the death phase, and their peptidoglycan cell walls have begun to degrade, preventing them from retaining the crystal violet-iodine complex.\n\nB. The student's pure culture was accidentally contaminated with a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium during incubation.\n\nC. The student over-decolorized the entire slide with alcohol, causing all the Gram-positive cells to lose some of their primary stain.\n\nD. The two-week-old culture medium became acidic, which chemically altered the safranin counterstain, causing it to bind to some Gram-positive cells.\n\nE. *Bacillus subtilis* is a facultative anaerobe, and the cells that grew in anaerobic microenvironments within the culture developed a thinner cell wall, causing them to stain like Gram-negative cells.", "solution": "We identify the relevant principle of the Gram stain: Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick peptidoglycan cell wall that, when intact, retains the crystal violet-iodine complex during the alcohol decolorization step, so they appear purple. Gram-negative bacteria, with a thinner peptidoglycan layer and outer membrane, lose the complex upon alcohol treatment and take up the counterstain (safranin), appearing pink.\n\nWe consider the experimental conditions: the culture is two weeks old. In aging cultures, many cells have progressed into the stationary or death phase. During this period, autolytic enzymes and general cell wall turnover lead to degradation and damage of the peptidoglycan layer. As the integrity of the peptidoglycan is compromised, some Gram-positive cells lose the ability to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex upon alcohol decolorization. Consequently, even though the organism is Gram-positive, damaged or dying cells can appear pink (Gram-negative) after counterstaining, producing a mixed field of purple and pink rods.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- Option A attributes the pink-staining cells to peptidoglycan degradation in an aging culture, which matches the known mechanism of Gram variability in old Gram-positive cultures. This directly explains a mixed population of purple and pink rods under correct technique and a pure culture.\n- Option B contradicts the assumption that the culture was pure and does not explain why the pink cells would share the same morphology; moreover, the problem stipulates correct technique and purity, making contamination unlikely.\n- Option C (over-decolorization) would tend to affect the entire smear uniformly, often causing most or all Gram-positive cells to appear pink, not a mixed result, and is inconsistent with the assumption of correct technique.\n- Option D posits chemical alteration of safranin due to medium acidity; this is not a recognized mechanism for selective binding of safranin to Gram-positive cells and would not produce the observed Gram variability in a predictable way.\n- Option E claims oxygen conditions alter cell wall thickness sufficiently to change Gram reaction; Gram reaction is fundamentally determined by cell wall structure intrinsic to the species and is not known to shift to Gram-negative staining due to anaerobic growth. Moreover, this is not the established reason for mixed staining in aging cultures.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that in an aging culture, many cells have compromised peptidoglycan and fail to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex, yielding Gram-variable staining.
