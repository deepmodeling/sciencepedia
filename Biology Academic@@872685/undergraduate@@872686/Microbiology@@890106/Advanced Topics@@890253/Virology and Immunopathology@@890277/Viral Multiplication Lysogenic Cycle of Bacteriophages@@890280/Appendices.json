{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "For a temperate phage, the decision to enter the lysogenic cycle is a pivotal moment that depends on a suite of molecular tools. This first practice explores the absolute necessity of the integrase enzyme, which performs the surgical insertion of the phage genome into the host's chromosome. By considering a scenario where this crucial enzyme is non-functional, you are challenged to deduce the logical outcome of the infection and understand why lysogeny is an active, regulated process, not a passive default. [@problem_id:2104500]", "problem": "Temperate bacteriophages are viruses capable of infecting bacteria and pursuing one of two distinct life cycles. The lytic cycle involves the immediate replication of the virus, culminating in the destruction (lysis) of the host cell and the release of new phage particles. Alternatively, the lysogenic cycle allows the phage to integrate its genome into the host bacterium's chromosome. In this dormant state, known as a prophage, the viral DNA is replicated along with the host DNA during cell division. The decision between these two pathways is influenced by environmental conditions and a complex regulatory network. The physical insertion of the phage genome into the host chromosome is a crucial step for lysogeny and is catalyzed by a phage-encoded enzyme called integrase.\n\nSuppose a strain of a temperate bacteriophage acquires a loss-of-function mutation in the gene that codes for its integrase enzyme, rendering the enzyme completely non-functional. An individual phage from this mutant strain successfully infects a susceptible bacterium. Assuming all other phage functions are normal and the conditions are suitable for lysogeny, what is the most likely outcome of this infection?\n\nA. The phage genome will be unable to enter the host cell.\n\nB. The phage genome will be integrated at a random, non-specific location in the host chromosome.\n\nC. The host cell will become immune to further infection by the same type of phage, but will not be lysed.\n\nD. The phage will be forced to enter the lytic cycle, leading to the production of new virions and lysis of the host cell.\n\nE. The phage DNA will remain in the cytoplasm as a stable, non-replicating circular molecule.", "solution": "We identify the critical biological steps and constraints:\n\n1. Temperate phages choose between lytic and lysogenic cycles through a regulatory network. Entry of the phage genome into the host cell is mediated by adsorption and injection machinery (tail fibers, baseplate, sheath contraction), not by integrase. Therefore, loss of integrase does not affect genome entry.\n\n2. Lysogeny requires stable maintenance of the phage genome in the host lineage. For canonical site-specific lysogeny (e.g., phage lambda), this occurs by integrase-catalyzed recombination between the phage attachment site ($attP$) and the bacterial attachment site ($attB$), generating a prophage in the chromosome. Integrase is essential for this step.\n\n3. If integrase is non-functional (loss-of-function), site-specific integration cannot occur. Without alternative plasmid-like maintenance systems (which are not implied and, for cases like lambda, do not exist for a stable, non-replicating episome), the phage cannot form a stable lysogen.\n\n4. Evaluate options:\n- A is incorrect because integrase is not required for DNA entry.\n- B is incorrect because temperate phage integration is site-specific via integrase; random integration is not the typical or expected outcome in bacteria without specialized machinery.\n- C is incorrect because lysogenic immunity requires a stable prophage expressing the repressor; with no integration, such stable immunity is not established, and in the absence of a maintained prophage, the infection does not simply persist without lysis.\n- E is unlikely and internally inconsistent: a non-replicating circular molecule would not be stable and would be diluted or degraded; moreover, many temperate phages do not maintain stable episomes without integration machinery and dedicated plasmid maintenance systems.\n\n5. Consequently, when lysogeny cannot be established due to integrase loss, the remaining productive pathway is the lytic cycle, resulting in virion production and host lysis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the phage is forced into the lytic cycle and lyses the host cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2104500"}, {"introduction": "Once lysogeny is established, the state must be maintained, protecting the host cell and ensuring the prophage's survival. This exercise delves into the elegant mechanism of \"superinfection immunity,\" a key feature of the lysogenic state. You will analyze how the cI repressor protein, produced by the resident prophage, acts as a diffusible guardian that can repress the lytic ambitions of newly infecting phages, illustrating a core principle of gene regulation and host-virus dynamics. [@problem_id:2104441]", "problem": "A bacterial cell is a stable lysogen, meaning its chromosome contains an integrated prophage from a temperate bacteriophage (let's call it phage Lambda). The maintenance of the lysogenic state is dependent on the continuous expression of the prophage's *cI* gene, which produces a repressor protein (cI protein) that diffuses throughout the host's cytoplasm. This repressor effectively silences the genes required for the lytic cycle.\n\nThis lysogenic bacterium is then superinfected with a high multiplicity of a mutant Lambda phage. This mutant possesses a null mutation in its *cI* gene (*cI*-), rendering it incapable of synthesizing its own repressor protein. When this *cI*- mutant infects a non-lysogenic, sensitive bacterium, it is obligately lytic, always resulting in host cell lysis and the formation of characteristic \"clear plaques\" on a bacterial lawn.\n\nAssuming the operator sites on the superinfecting phage's DNA are fully functional and identical to those of the wild-type phage, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate fate of the superinfected cell?\n\nA. The cell will survive, and the superinfecting phage's lytic genes will be repressed, preventing its replication.\n\nB. The cell will lyse because the superinfecting phage is obligately lytic and its genome will immediately direct the synthesis of lytic-cycle proteins.\n\nC. The presence of the superinfecting phage will trigger the induction of the resident prophage, leading to both phages entering the lytic cycle and causing cell lysis.\n\nD. The superinfecting phage's DNA will integrate into the host chromosome as a second prophage, resulting in a stable double lysogen.\n\nE. The superinfecting phage's DNA will be destroyed by the host cell's restriction-modification system, leaving the original lysogenic state unaltered.", "solution": "A stable lysogen continuously expresses the prophage cI repressor from its integrated genome. The cI protein is a trans-acting diffusible repressor that binds with high affinity to the phage operator sites that control the early lytic promoters (classically, OL and OR controlling PL and PR). In the lysogenic state, cI occupancy at these operators represses transcription from PL and PR, thereby preventing expression of early lytic genes required to initiate the lytic cycle.\n\nUpon superinfection by a cI-null mutant phage whose operator sites are fully functional and identical to those of wild type, the incoming phage DNA presents the same operator binding sites. Because cI acts in trans and is already present at sufficient concentration in the lysogen’s cytoplasm, the resident cI repressor will bind the operators on the superinfecting genomes and repress their PL and PR promoters immediately. The fact that the superinfecting phage is cI-null is immaterial for the immediate outcome because repression is provided by the host’s resident prophage in trans; thus, the mutant phage cannot initiate expression of early lytic genes and cannot commence the lytic program.\n\nInduction of the resident prophage would require inactivation of cI (for example, via RecA-mediated autocleavage during an SOS response), which is not triggered simply by superinfection; therefore, immediate induction is not expected. Integration of the superinfecting genome would require expression of the integration machinery (e.g., integrase), whose transcription is under PL control and is repressed by cI, so integration is blocked. Destruction by restriction-modification is not the governing principle in this classical scenario and is not implied by the setup.\n\nTherefore, the correct immediate fate is that the lysogenic cell survives and the lytic genes of the superinfecting cI-null phage are repressed by the resident cI repressor (superinfection immunity).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2104441"}, {"introduction": "The lysogenic cycle's impact extends far beyond the individual infected cell, playing a major role in bacterial evolution through horizontal gene transfer.
