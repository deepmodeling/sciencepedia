This first practice problem [@problem_id:2096654] challenges you to act as a virologist, using clues about a newly discovered virus's genome and its initial behavior inside a host cell to determine its place within the seven classes. Pay close attention to the relationship between the viral genome and the host's translation machinery.", "problem": "A team of virologists is studying a newly discovered virus that infects eukaryotic cells. Their initial analysis reveals that the virus's genetic material consists of a single-stranded Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule. Through a series of experiments, they meticulously track the first few steps of the viral replication cycle after the genome enters the host cell's cytoplasm. They make two key observations:\n\n1.  Immediately upon entry, the viral RNA genome is recognized and translated by the host cell's ribosomes, leading to the production of a large viral polyprotein.\n2.  This polyprotein is then cleaved into several functional proteins. One of these proteins is an enzyme that uses the original viral RNA genome as a template to synthesize a new, full-length RNA strand that is complementary to the original genome.\n\nThe Baltimore classification system categorizes viruses into seven classes based on their type of genome and their strategy for synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA). Based on the observations, to which Baltimore class does this new virus belong?\n\nA. Class I (dsDNA viruses)\n\nB. Class III (dsRNA viruses)\n\nC. Class IV ((+)ssRNA viruses)\n\nD. Class V ((-)ssRNA viruses)\n\nE. Class VI ((+)ssRNA-RT, retroviruses)", "solution": "We identify the Baltimore class by matching the genome type and the strategy for generating mRNA.\n\nFirst observation: Upon entry, the viral RNA genome is directly recognized by host ribosomes and translated into a large polyprotein. This implies the genome itself functions as mRNA. A genome that is immediately translatable by host ribosomes must be positive-sense single-stranded RNA, because only a positive-sense RNA has the same polarity as host mRNA. This excludes:\n- Class I (dsDNA), because DNA is not directly translated.\n- Class III (dsRNA), because double-stranded RNA is not directly translated and requires a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to produce mRNAs.\n- Class V ((-)ssRNA), because negative-sense RNA cannot be directly translated and must be transcribed by a packaged RdRp into (+)-sense mRNAs before translation.\n- Class VI ((+)ssRNA-RT, retroviruses), because although the genome is positive-sense RNA, their defining replication step is reverse transcription to DNA by reverse transcriptase, not immediate cytoplasmic translation of the incoming genomic RNA to a polyprotein as the primary replication strategy.\n\nSecond observation: One of the proteins produced is an enzyme that uses the original viral RNA genome as a template to synthesize a new, full-length complementary RNA strand. This is the hallmark of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizing the (-)-sense complementary strand from a (+)-sense genomic RNA, forming a replicative intermediate. This is characteristic of (+)ssRNA viruses (Baltimore Class IV), which translate their genome to produce RdRp, then use RdRp to synthesize a (-)-sense template to replicate the genome.\n\nCombining both observations, the virus is a (+)ssRNA virus in Baltimore Class IV.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2096654"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, a virus's genome type can be misleading if its replication strategy isn't fully considered. This exercise [@problem_id:2096647] presents a virus with a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome, which might initially point to Class I. However, a unique step involving an RNA intermediate and reverse transcription complicates the picture, highlighting that the complete pathway to genome replication is the true basis for classification.", "problem": "A team of virologists has isolated a novel pathogenic agent from a mammalian host. Through molecular analysis, they have characterized its fundamental properties. The virion contains a circular genome composed of double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (dsDNA). However, this dsDNA is not fully complete; one strand has a discontinuity, resulting in a \"gapped\" genome structure. Further investigation into its replication cycle reveals a unique strategy: the gapped dsDNA genome is first repaired and transcribed into a full-length pregenomic Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) molecule. This RNA molecule then serves as a template for a virus-encoded reverse transcriptase enzyme to synthesize new dsDNA genomes for progeny virions.\n\nBased on the Baltimore classification system, which class does this newly discovered virus belong to?\n\nA. Class I (dsDNA viruses)\n\nB. Class IV ((+)ssRNA viruses)\n\nC. Class VI (ssRNA-RT viruses)\n\nD. Class VII (dsDNA-RT viruses)\n\nE. Class III (dsRNA viruses)", "solution": "1) The Baltimore classification groups viruses by genome type and replication strategy. The key discriminators here are whether the genome is DNA or RNA, whether it is single- or double-stranded, and whether reverse transcription occurs and at what stage.\n\n2) The described virion contains a circular, partially double-stranded DNA genome with a gap in one strand (a “gapped” dsDNA). This matches the characteristic genome structure of hepadnaviruses.\n\n3) The replication strategy is that the gapped dsDNA is first repaired to a complete form and transcribed to produce a full-length pregenomic RNA. This RNA then serves as the template for a virus-encoded reverse transcriptase to synthesize new dsDNA genomes.\n\n4) Reverse transcription is present, but the virion genome is DNA (not RNA). This combination—DNA genome with replication through an RNA intermediate via reverse transcriptase—defines Baltimore Class VII (dsDNA-RT viruses).\n\n5) Exclusions:\n- Class I (dsDNA viruses) lack reverse transcription and do not use a pregenomic RNA intermediate in this way.\n- Class IV ((+)ssRNA viruses) have positive-sense RNA genomes and do not start from DNA.\n- Class VI ((+)ssRNA-RT viruses) are retroviruses with (+)ssRNA genomes that are reverse-transcribed into DNA; the starting genome is RNA, not DNA.\n- Class III (dsRNA viruses) have double-stranded RNA genomes and do not involve reverse transcription.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is Class VII (dsDNA-RT viruses).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2096647"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a scientific model also means understanding its boundaries and what it predicts shouldn't exist. This final thought experiment [@problem_id:2096674] moves beyond classifying known viruses to ask *why* a certain type of virus—one with a negative-sense single-stranded DNA ((-)ssDNA) genome—is not found in nature. To solve this, you must apply your knowledge of the fundamental biochemical constraints that govern both viral and host cell machinery.", "problem": "The Baltimore classification system is a widely used scheme in virology that categorizes viruses into seven groups based on their type of genome and its method of replication, with a central focus on the pathway to generating positive-sense messenger RNA ((+)mRNA). The host cell's ribosomes can only translate (+)mRNA to synthesize proteins. In this context, a nucleic acid strand is designated as positive-sense (+) if it has a sequence equivalent to the mRNA, while a negative-sense (-) strand is complementary to the mRNA.\n\nFor DNA viruses, the (+)ssDNA strand is the \"coding strand,\" and the (-)ssDNA strand is the \"template strand\" from which mRNA is transcribed. The Baltimore system includes Group II viruses, which have positive-sense single-stranded DNA ((+)ssDNA) genomes. However, there are no known naturally occurring viruses with a negative-sense single-stranded DNA ((-)ssDNA) genome.\n\nBased on your understanding of molecular biology and viral replication strategies, which of the following statements provides the most accurate biochemical and evolutionary explanation for the absence of (-)ssDNA viruses?\n\nA. Host cells lack the specific type of DNA polymerase required to synthesize a complementary strand from a (-)ssDNA template to form a double-stranded DNA intermediate.\n\nB. A (-)ssDNA genome would be immediately degraded by host cell nucleases that specifically target template strands, a vulnerability not shared by (+)ssDNA coding strands.\n\nC. The host cell's RNA polymerase cannot directly use any single-stranded DNA molecule as a template. Since both (+)ssDNA and potential (-)ssDNA genomes must first be converted into a double-stranded form using host enzymes, the (-)ssDNA strategy offers no unique biochemical advantage and is functionally redundant with the existing (+)ssDNA pathway.\n\nD. To replicate its genome, a (-)ssDNA virus would need to encode its own RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (Reverse Transcriptase), an energetically costly enzyme that has only evolved in the specialized lifecycle of retroviruses.\n\nE. The genetic code on a (-)ssDNA strand is inherently more prone to mutation during replication than the code on a (+)ssDNA strand, making it an evolutionarily unviable option for a genome.", "solution": "We begin from first principles of the Baltimore classification: the host translation machinery recognizes only positive-sense mRNA, so all viral genome strategies must produce positive-sense mRNA. For DNA viruses, cellular transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that initiates at promoters in duplex DNA; thus, a single-stranded DNA genome, whether annotated as positive or negative with respect to mRNA, must first be converted to a double-stranded DNA intermediate to enable transcription.\n\nAssessing each option against these biochemical constraints:\n\n1) Evaluate whether host DNA polymerases can synthesize a complementary DNA strand on a single-stranded DNA template (Option A). Cellular DNA-dependent DNA polymerases require a primer but can extend on a single-stranded DNA template once primed. Known (+)ssDNA viruses exploit host DNA polymerases by providing hairpin structures or other priming mechanisms to synthesize the complementary strand and form a double-stranded intermediate. There is no fundamental barrier preventing the same process from operating on a hypothetical (-)ssDNA template. Therefore, the assertion that host cells lack the necessary DNA polymerase is incorrect, so A is invalid.\n\n2) Evaluate selective nuclease degradation of (-)ssDNA versus (+)ssDNA (Option B). Cellular nucleases do not distinguish “template” strands from “coding” strands; their recognition is based on structure and sequence context rather than polarity with respect to mRNA. Both polarities of ssDNA would have similar susceptibility to nucleases, contingent on protective capsid delivery, nuclear entry, and secondary structures. Therefore, B is invalid.\n\n3) Determine whether either polarity of ssDNA can be directly transcribed by host RNA polymerases and whether one polarity affords a unique advantage (Option C). Cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerases generally initiate transcription at promoters within double-stranded DNA. Although the transcription bubble locally unwinds DNA during elongation, initiation requires duplex promoter architecture; in vivo, host RNA polymerases do not productively initiate on naked single-stranded DNA templates. Consequently, both (+)ssDNA and hypothetical (-)ssDNA genomes must first be converted to a double-stranded DNA form using host DNA polymerases. Because both strategies converge on the same double-stranded intermediate for transcription, a (-)ssDNA genome affords no distinct biochemical advantage and is functionally redundant with the existing (+)ssDNA pathway. This provides a plausible biochemical and evolutionary explanation for why (-)ssDNA viruses are not observed: there is no unique niche or efficiency gain over the already successful (+)ssDNA mechanism. Hence, C is correct.\n\n4) Assess the requirement for reverse transcriptase (Option D). A (-)ssDNA genome would be copied by a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, not an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). Reverse transcriptase is specific to RNA-to-DNA copying. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n5) Evaluate inherent mutation rate differences due to strand polarity (Option E). Mutation rates are determined by polymerase fidelity, proofreading, repair pathways, and sequence/structural context, not by the arbitrary designation of a strand as “coding” or “template” with respect to mRNA. There is no intrinsic elevation of mutation rate for (-)ssDNA compared to (+)ssDNA. Therefore, E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate biochemical and evolutionary explanation is that both polarities of ssDNA would first need conversion to dsDNA for transcription, leaving (-)ssDNA without a unique functional advantage; this corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2096674"}]}
