This problem delves into the world of thermal processing, where changes in a food's physical properties, like viscosity, can dramatically alter heat transfer and impact safety. You will calculate how a simple recipe change for a tomato sauce necessitates a new processing time [@problem_id:2067369], highlighting the critical link between food formulation and the engineering of safe preservation methods.", "problem": "An artisanal food company is developing a new \"extra-thick\" tomato and basil sauce. Their standard thermal process for their original, lower-viscosity sauce is conducted in a retort operating at a constant temperature, $T_{RT} = 125.0$ °C. The sauce is filled into jars at an initial uniform temperature of $T_{IH} = 70.0$ °C. The standard process time for the original sauce is $P_{t,1} = 40.0$ minutes, which is known to achieve commercial sterility.\n\nThe rate of heating at the slowest heating point (the \"cold spot\") inside the jar is characterized by the heat penetration factor, $f_h$, which is the time in minutes required for the heating curve to traverse one log cycle. For the original sauce, which heats primarily by natural convection, the heat penetration factor is $f_{h,1} = 8.00$ minutes. For the new, extra-thick sauce, added starches inhibit fluid motion, causing heat to transfer primarily by conduction. This results in a much larger heat penetration factor of $f_{h,2} = 30.0$ minutes.\n\nThe temperature $T$ at the cold spot as a function of processing time $t$ can be modeled by the following simplified heating equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T) = \\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T_{IH}) - \\frac{t}{f_h} $$\nAssume that \"commercial sterility\" is achieved when the cold spot reaches a specific, critical final temperature.

This final temperature must be the same for both the original process and the new process.\n\nThe temperature evolution at the cold spot is governed by the equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T) = \\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T_{IH}) - \\frac{t}{f_h} $$\n\nFirst, let's determine the final temperature, $T_{final}$, reached during the original process.

Substituting these values into the governing equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T_{final}) = \\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T_{IH}) - \\frac{P_{t,1}}{f_{h,1}} $$\n\nNow, consider the new, extra-thick sauce. It must be processed for a time $P_{t,2}$ to reach the same final temperature $T_{final}$. The heat penetration factor for the new sauce is $f_{h,2} = 30.0$ min.

The equation for the new process is:\n$$ \\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T_{final}) = \\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T_{IH}) - \\frac{P_{t,2}}{f_{h,2}} $$\n\nSince the left-hand side, $\\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T_{final})$, and the first term on the right-hand side, $\\log_{10}(T_{RT} - T_{IH})$, are the same in both equations, the second term on the right-hand side must also be equal for both processes.\n$$ -\\frac{P_{t,1}}{f_{h,1}} = -\\frac{P_{t,2}}{f_{h,2}} $$\n\nWe can solve this simple algebraic equation for the new process time, $P_{t,2}$:\n$$ \\frac{P_{t,1}}{f_{h,1}} = \\frac{P_{t,2}}{f_{h,2}} $$\n$$ P_{t,2} = P_{t,1} \\times \\frac{f_{h,2}}{f_{h,1}} $$\n\nThis result shows that, under the given model, the required process time is directly proportional to the heat penetration factor. This makes physical sense: if heat penetrates more slowly (larger $f_h$), a longer time is needed to reach the same internal temperature.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$ P_{t,1} = 40.0 \\text{ min} $$\n$$ f_{h,1} = 8.00 \\text{ min} $$\n$$ f_{h,2} = 30.0 \\text{ min} $$\n$$ P_{t,2} = 40.0 \\text{ min} \\times \\frac{30.0 \\text{ min}}{8.00 \\text{ min}} $$\n$$ P_{t,2} = 40.0 \\times 3.75 \\text{ min} $$\n$$ P_{t,2} = 150 \\text{ min} $$\n\nThe input values have three significant figures.
