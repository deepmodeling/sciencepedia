The procedure begins by weighing out 1.50 g of the powder and dissolving it in a sterile buffer to a final volume of 100.0 mL, creating the stock solution. Next, a series of ten-fold dilutions is performed. Specifically, 1.0 mL of the stock solution is transferred to 9.0 mL of buffer to create the first dilution ($10^{-1}$), and this process is repeated sequentially to create further dilutions up to $10^{-8}$.\n\nFrom the tubes corresponding to the $10^{-5}$, $10^{-6}$, and $10^{-7}$ dilutions, a 0.100 mL aliquot of each is spread onto a separate nutrient agar plate. After incubation under appropriate conditions, the number of visible bacterial colonies is counted. The results are as follows:\n\n- Plate from the $10^{-5}$ dilution: Too Numerous To Count (TNTC)\n- Plate from the $10^{-6}$ dilution: 215 colonies\n- Plate from the $10^{-7}$ dilution: 24 colonies\n\nBased on these results, calculate the concentration of viable bacteria in the original, undiluted powder.

The human stomach presents a formidable barrier with its highly acidic environment, which is lethal to many beneficial bacteria. In this problem, you will step into the role of a formulation scientist to solve this critical delivery challenge for an acid-sensitive, anaerobic probiotic, evaluating different strategies to ensure the synbiotic payload reaches the lower intestine intact. [@problem_id:2088700]", "problem": "A biotechnology firm is developing a high-potency synbiotic supplement. The formulation is intended to deliver a specific strain of *Bifidobacterium longum*, a beneficial probiotic bacterium, along with its preferred prebiotic substrate, Fructooligosaccharide (FOS). The primary therapeutic target for this supplement is the colon. Laboratory testing has established two key characteristics of the selected *B. longum* strain: it is a strict anaerobe, and its viability decreases by over 99.9% following a 30-minute exposure to an environment with a pH of 2.0.\n\nThe human digestive tract presents a significant challenge: the stomach maintains a highly acidic environment with a pH typically between 1.5 and 3.5, while the small intestine's pH gradually increases from approximately 6.0 to 7.4, and the colon's pH is typically between 5.5 and 7.0. The firm is considering several oral delivery formulations to maximize the number of viable *B. longum* bacteria that, along with the FOS, reach the colon.\n\nWhich of the following formulations and its accompanying rationale represents the most effective strategy for achieving the company's goal?\n\nA. A chewable tablet containing a blend of lyophilized (freeze-dried) *B. longum* and FOS powder. The rationale is that mixing with saliva initiates rehydration and the slightly alkaline nature of saliva helps protect the bacteria.\n\nB. A standard gelatin capsule containing lyophilized *B. longum* and FOS. The rationale is that the capsule protects the contents from atmospheric oxygen and moisture, and its rapid dissolution in the stomach ensures prompt release of the synbiotic components.\n\nC. A liquid suspension containing live, active *B. longum* and dissolved FOS in a solution buffered to a pH of 7.0. The rationale is that the chemical buffer will neutralize the stomach acid, allowing the bacteria to pass through the stomach unharmed.\n\nD. An enteric-coated capsule containing a mixture of lyophilized *B. longum* and FOS. The enteric coating is a polymer designed to remain intact in acidic conditions but dissolve at a pH greater than 6.5. The rationale is that this protects the acid-sensitive bacteria from the gastric environment and facilitates a simultaneous release of the probiotic and its prebiotic substrate in the lower intestine.\n\nE. A dual-component system where the FOS is consumed as a powder mixed in water, and the lyophilized *B. longum* is taken separately in an enteric-coated capsule. The rationale is that separating the components prevents the FOS from drawing water away from the rehydrating bacteria, thus avoiding osmotic stress upon release.", "solution": "We are asked to select the most effective oral delivery formulation to maximize viable strict anaerobic *Bifidobacterium longum* reaching the colon together with its preferred prebiotic, FOS, given that this strain loses viability by more than 0.999 fraction after 30 minutes at pH equal to 2.0, and that the stomach is highly acidic while the small intestine and colon are near neutral to mildly acidic. The key principles are:\n- Acid protection is essential because exposure to gastric pH near 2.0 reduces survival to less than $10^{-3}$ of the initial population.\n- Targeted release beyond the stomach, ideally in the distal small intestine or colon, is needed to avoid acid and to reach the therapeutic site.\n- Strict anaerobes benefit from minimizing oxygen exposure prior to release and from co-localized delivery of substrate at the site of colonization.\n- An oral buffer with realistic volume cannot neutralize gastric acid reliably due to limited buffering capacity relative to gastric acid secretion.\n\nEvaluate each option against these principles:\n\nOption A (chewable tablet with lyophilized bacteria and FOS; saliva rehydration): Chewing exposes the bacteria to oxygen and initiates rehydration in the mouth. Partial alkalinity of saliva cannot protect against subsequent gastric acid. Upon swallowing, immediate exposure to low gastric pH will occur, causing a rapid viability loss to a survival fraction less than $10^{-3}$ based on the strain’s sensitivity. Therefore, this does not provide adequate gastric protection and is contraindicated for a strict anaerobe.\n\nOption B (standard gelatin capsule with lyophilized bacteria and FOS; rapid gastric dissolution): Standard gelatin capsules dissolve in the stomach, causing immediate release into an environment with pH often near 2.0. Given the established acid sensitivity, this leads to catastrophic loss of viability. Although the capsule may limit oxygen and moisture pre-ingestion, it offers no gastric protection. This fails the acid-protection requirement.\n\nOption C (neutral buffered liquid suspension): Although the suspension is buffered to pH equal to 7.0, the buffering capacity required to neutralize gastric acid is far beyond what is practical for oral administration, because gastric acid secretion and the large acid reservoir will titrate the buffer, lowering pH in the stomach. Consequently, the bacteria will still be exposed to low pH for a clinically meaningful period, resulting in survival fractions less than $10^{-3}$. Additionally, a liquid format exposes live cells to oxygen and other stresses and provides no targeted release. This fails both acid protection and site targeting.\n\nOption D (enteric-coated capsule that dissolves at pH greater than 6.5 with co-formulated lyophilized bacteria and FOS): An enteric coating is designed to remain intact in acidic conditions and dissolve above a threshold pH, here greater than 6.5, which is typically encountered in the distal small intestine and proximal colon. This directly addresses the acid-sensitivity by preventing gastric exposure, preserves strict anaerobes by keeping them lyophilized and sealed from oxygen until they reach a relatively anaerobic environment, and achieves co-localized release of the probiotic with its prebiotic substrate near the therapeutic site, supporting colonization and growth. This matches all key requirements: acid protection, anaerobe handling, and targeted co-delivery.\n\nOption E (FOS as water-mixed powder; bacteria in an enteric capsule, taken separately): Enteric protection for the bacteria is appropriate; FOS, being nondigestible, can transit to the colon even if taken separately. However, the rationale given—avoiding osmotic stress during rehydration—is weaker than the benefit of ensuring synchronized, co-localized release with the bacteria in the lower intestine. Separating the components may reduce immediate substrate availability exactly where the bacteria are released, potentially limiting early colonization advantages. Thus, while partially acceptable, it is less optimal than coordinated release afforded by Option D.\n\nTherefore, the most effective strategy is to use an enteric-coated capsule that remains intact in the stomach and dissolves at pH greater than 6.5, releasing lyophilized *B. longum* together with FOS in the lower intestine, which maximizes survival across the stomach and supports colon delivery and colonization.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2088700"}, {"introduction": "A key feature that distinguishes a prebiotic from non-specific fiber is its selective utilization by beneficial host microorganisms.
