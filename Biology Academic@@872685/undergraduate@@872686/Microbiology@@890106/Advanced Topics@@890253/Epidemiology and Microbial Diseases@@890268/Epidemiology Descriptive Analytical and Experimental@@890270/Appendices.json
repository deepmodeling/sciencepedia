All confirmed cases were traced back to a single exposure event that occurred on May 1st.

The trial enrolled 20,000 healthy adult volunteers, with 10,000 receiving the vaccine and 10,000 receiving a placebo. The primary endpoint was the incidence of symptomatic APV infection over a one-year follow-up period.\n\nAt the end of the trial, the following data were collected:\n- In the vaccine group ($N_V = 10,000$), there were 50 cases of symptomatic APV infection.\n- In the placebo group ($N_P = 10,000$), there were 200 cases of symptomatic APV infection.\n\nHowever, a post-hoc analysis of stored serum samples from the end of the trial revealed an unexpected confounding factor. A different, naturally circulating virus, the \"Betan-Pox Virus\" (BPV), which is antigenically related to APV but causes only asymptomatic or very mild infection, was prevalent during the trial period. This natural exposure to BPV appears to have conferred some cross-protective immunity against APV.\n\nA detailed analysis of the placebo group provided the following stratification:\n- Of the 10,000 individuals in the placebo group, serological testing confirmed that 4,000 had been infected with BPV during the one-year trial period.\n- Among these 4,000 BPV-exposed individuals in the placebo group, 50 developed symptomatic APV infection.\n- Among the 6,000 individuals in the placebo group who were not exposed to BPV, 150 developed symptomatic APV infection.\n\nAssuming the exposure to BPV occurred independently of the trial randomization, calculate the true, adjusted efficacy of the APV vaccine.
