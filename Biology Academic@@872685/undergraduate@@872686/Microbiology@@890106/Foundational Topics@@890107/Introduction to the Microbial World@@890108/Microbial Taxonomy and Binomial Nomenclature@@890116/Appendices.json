Just as grammar is essential for clear writing, the formatting rules for scientific names are a critical part of scientific literacy. This first exercise tests your understanding of these foundational rules for capitalizing and styling the genus and species names, which is the first step toward professional scientific communication [@problem_id:2080882].", "problem": "In a microbiology lab report, a student identifies a bacterial species and writes its name as *staphylococcus Aureus*. According to the formal rules of binomial nomenclature used in scientific writing, which of the following statements correctly identifies the primary formatting errors present in the student's notation?\n\nA. The entire scientific name should be underlined instead of italicized.\n\nB. The genus name should be capitalized, and the species epithet should be an abbreviation.\n\nC. The genus name is correctly formatted, but the species epithet should be lowercase.\n\nD. The genus name should be capitalized, and the species epithet should be lowercase.\n\nE. Both the genus name and the species epithet should be lowercase.", "solution": "In formal binomial nomenclature, the following rules apply to formatting:\n- The scientific name consists of the genus name followed by the species epithet.\n- The genus name is capitalized; the species epithet is lowercase.\n- Both genus and species are italicized when typed; when handwritten, each part is underlined separately.\n- The species epithet is never abbreviated; the genus may be abbreviated after the first full mention.\n\nThe student wrote the name as italicized \"*staphylococcus Aureus*\". Comparing this to the rules:\n- The genus name appears in lowercase (\"staphylococcus\") when it must be capitalized (\"Staphylococcus\").\n- The species epithet appears with an initial capital letter (\"Aureus\") when it must be lowercase (\"aureus\").\n- Italicization is correct in typed text, so underlining is not required, and there is no rule that the species epithet should be abbreviated.\n\nTherefore, the primary formatting errors are that the genus should be capitalized and the species epithet should be lowercase, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2080882"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple formatting, the naming of organisms is governed by a strict set of international rules to ensure stability and uniqueness. A core tenet of this system is the Principle of Priority, which states that the first validly published name for a taxon is the correct one. This practice presents a hypothetical scenario to illustrate why this rule is essential for preventing the chaos that would ensue if two different organisms shared the same name [@problem_id:2080903].", "problem": "A microbiologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, isolates a novel species of bacterium from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent in 2022. After extensive characterization, including full genome sequencing, she proposes the name *Oceanius profundus* for this new species. She submits her findings for publication, including a formal description and the designation of a type strain, which gets validly published in a recognized microbiology journal in January 2023.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, another research group led by Dr. Ben Carter had isolated a completely different bacterium from Antarctic soil in 1985. They had also validly published the name *Oceanius profundus* for their isolate in a journal article in 1986, following all the rules of nomenclature in effect at that time.\n\nWhen the nomenclatural committee reviews Dr. Sharma's 2023 proposal, what is the most likely outcome regarding the name *Oceanius profundus* for her deep-sea bacterium, according to the principles of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP)?\n\nA. The name *Oceanius profundus* is accepted for Dr. Sharma's bacterium because her research used modern genomic techniques, which supersede the older 1986 classification.\n\nB. Both bacteria will be allowed to hold the name *Oceanius profundus*, but they will be distinguished by adding the authors' names and dates, such as *Oceanius profundus* Sharma 2023.\n\nC. The name *Oceanius profundus* is rejected for Dr. Sharma's bacterium because the name was already validly published for a different prokaryote, and the earlier name has priority.\n\nD. The name *Oceanius profundus* is accepted for Dr. Sharma's bacterium, and the name for Dr. Carter's 1986 bacterium is declared invalid because nomenclatural rules have changed significantly since 1985.", "solution": "We apply the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) step by step:\n\n1) Verify valid publication for both names. By the problem statement, both Dr. Carter’s 1986 name and Dr. Sharma’s 2023 name were validly published for different bacteria. Therefore, both constitute available names under the Code.\n\n2) Invoke the Principle of Priority. Under the ICNP, the earlier validly published name has priority (often referred to as Principle of Priority; see Rule 23 on valid publication and priority). This principle dictates that, for the same taxonomic rank and the same name, the earliest valid publication takes precedence.\n\n3) Apply the rule on homonymy. The ICNP prohibits later homonyms: the identical binomial combination cannot be used for two different species within the same genus. Under the ICNP (e.g., Rule 51), a later homonym is not legitimate and must be rejected. The appropriate action is to replace the later homonym with a new name (a nomen novum) or to otherwise resolve the conflict by selecting a different epithet or taxonomic placement, but the later identical name itself cannot stand.\n\n4) Apply these principles to the case. Since Dr. Carter validly published the name Oceanius profundus in 1986, and Dr. Sharma later proposed the same binomial Oceanius profundus in 2023 for a different taxon, Dr. Sharma’s name is a later homonym. By the Principle of Priority and the rule against homonymy, her proposed name must be rejected as illegitimate, and a replacement name is required for her bacterium.\n\n5) Eliminate incorrect alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because the ICNP does not allow modern methods to supersede nomenclatural priority; methodological advances do not override the Principle of Priority.\n- B is incorrect because author citations do not legitimize homonyms; two distinct taxa cannot share the same binomial even if appended with different author names and dates.\n- D is incorrect because validly published older names are not rendered invalid simply due to subsequent methodological or rule changes, except under formal conservation/rejection procedures not indicated here.\n\nTherefore, the correct outcome is that the later name is rejected due to priority and homonymy, matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2080903"}, {"introduction": "How do we decide if two microbes are different enough to be called separate species? While historical methods relied on physical traits, modern microbial taxonomy increasingly uses genomic data to draw these lines objectively. This exercise introduces you to a powerful tool in this field, the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), and challenges you to act as a taxonomist by applying quantitative thresholds to genomic data to delineate species and genera from a set of newly discovered strains [@problem_id:2080919].", "problem": "A research team studying extremophiles at a deep-sea hydrothermal vent has isolated five novel strains of archaea, labeled A, B, C, D, and E. To assign them to a preliminary taxonomic classification, the team performed whole-genome sequencing and calculated the pairwise Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) for all strains. The results are provided in the table below, with each value representing the ANI percentage between the strain in the corresponding row and column.\n\n| Strain | A | B | C | D | E |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| **A** | 100 | 97.2 | 78.1 | 77.9 | 72.3 |\n| **B** | 97.2 | 100 | 78.3 | 78.0 | 72.5 |\n| **C** | 78.1 | 78.3 | 100 | 96.5 | 73.8 |\n| **D** | 77.9 | 78.0 | 96.5 | 100 | 74.0 |\n| **E** | 72.3 | 72.5 | 73.8 | 74.0 | 100 |\n\nModern microbial taxonomy uses the following standard operational thresholds based on ANI for delineation:\n1. Two strains are considered to belong to the same species if their pairwise ANI value is 95.0% or greater.\n2. Strains belonging to different species are considered to be within the same genus if their pairwise ANI value is 76.0% or greater.\n\nBased on the provided data and these taxonomic rules, determine the total number of distinct species and the total number of distinct genera represented by these five strains. Your final answer should be a row matrix with two entries, representing the number of distinct species and the number of distinct genera, in that order.", "solution": "We are given pairwise Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values among strains A, B, C, D, and E. The species threshold is ANI at or above $0.950$, and the genus threshold (for strains of different species) is ANI at or above $0.760$. All table entries such as $97.2$ correspond to decimals such as $0.972$.\n\nStep 1 (species delineation): By the rule, two strains are in the same species if and only if their pairwise ANI is at least $0.950$. We examine all pairs:\n- Between A and B: $0.972 \\geq 0.950$, so A and B are the same species.\n- Between C and D: $0.965 \\geq 0.950$, so C and D are the same species.\n- All other inter-pair values are below $0.950$: A with C, D, E have $0.781$, $0.779$, $0.723$; B with C, D, E have $0.783$, $0.780$, $0.725$; C with E is $0.738$; D with E is $0.740$. Hence no further species merges occur.\nTherefore, the species clusters (connected components under the relation “ANI $\\geq 0.950$”) are $\\{A,B\\}$, $\\{C,D\\}$, and $\\{E\\}$. Thus, the total number of distinct species is $3$.\n\nStep 2 (genus delineation): A standard operational way to apply the genus threshold is to consider the graph on strains with an edge between any two strains whose ANI is at least $0.760$; connected components of this graph correspond to genera, since all within-species edges (ANI $\\geq 0.950$) are also within-genus edges, and between-species edges with ANI $\\geq 0.760$ link species into the same genus.\n- Within $\\{A,B\\}$ and within $\\{C,D\\}$, edges exist because $0.972 \\geq 0.760$ and $0.965 \\geq 0.760$.\n- Between the two species $\\{A,B\\}$ and $\\{C,D\\}$, all cross-pairs satisfy the genus threshold: $A$–$C$ is $0.781 \\geq 0.760$, $A$–$D$ is $0.779 \\geq 0.760$, $B$–$C$ is $0.783 \\geq 0.760$, and $B$–$D$ is $0.780 \\geq 0.760$. Hence $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ form one connected component at the $0.760$ threshold and belong to the same genus.\n- Strain $E$ has ANI values with all others strictly below $0.760$: $A$–$E$ is $0.723$, $B$–$E$ is $0.725$, $C$–$E$ is $0.738$, $D$–$E$ is $0.740$. Therefore, $E$ forms its own genus-level connected component.\nThus, there are $2$ genera: one containing $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ and one containing $\\{E\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct species is $3$ and the total number of distinct genera is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}3 & 2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2080919"}]}
