The spirochete possesses a rigid protoplasmic cylinder. Numerous axial filaments are anchored to the exterior of this cylinder, and this entire complex is then encased by a flexible outer sheath.\n\nB. A flexible protoplasmic cylinder is surrounded by a loose-fitting outer sheath.

They are working with a strain of *Borrelia burgdorferi*, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease. This organism possesses specialized structures called axial filaments, which are a type of flagellum located within the periplasmic space (the region between the cell's inner and outer membranes). The researchers successfully introduce a targeted genetic mutation that completely prevents the synthesis and assembly of the protein subunits that form these axial filaments. All other cellular structures and metabolic functions remain initially unaffected by this specific mutation.\n\nBased on the known function of axial filaments in spirochetes, what is the most likely and immediate consequence for a *Borrelia* cell carrying this mutation?\n\nA. The cell will become spherical and lose its ability to divide, but its motility will remain unchanged.\n\nB. The cell will retain its helical shape but will lose its ability to move through its environment.\n\nC.

In their absence, the cell loses this helical morphology and becomes straight or less curved.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option based on these principles.\n- Option A: Incorrect. Loss of axial filaments does not specifically cause sphericity or block division, and motility would not remain unchanged; it would be lost.\n- Option B: Incorrect. While motility is lost, the helical shape is not retained; axial filaments contribute to the helical morphology, so shape would also be altered.\n- Option C: Incorrect. Motility would not be unaffected; it would be lost. Attachment is mediated primarily by surface adhesins, not axial filaments directly.\n- Option D: Correct. Absence of axial filaments leads to loss of characteristic helical shape and non-motility.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and immediate consequence is loss of helical shape and loss of motility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2055406"}, {"introduction": "Spirochete propulsion is a beautiful example of systems biology, where the interaction between parts is as important as the parts themselves. This final practice explores how the physical properties of the cell body are essential for converting the motor's rotation into effective corkscrew motion [@problem_id:2055357]. By considering a cell with a rigid outer sheath, you can appreciate why flexibility is a critical design feature for motility in viscous environments.", "problem": "Spirochetes are a phylum of bacteria characterized by their long, helical shape and a unique mechanism of motility. Their structure consists of a central protoplasmic cylinder, which is also helical, surrounded by a cell membrane and a peptidoglycan cell wall. Within the periplasmic space, located between the protoplasmic cylinder and an outer sheath, are specialized flagella known as axial filaments or endoflagella. These filaments are anchored at each pole of the cell and extend towards the opposite end. The rotation of these axial filaments within the periplasm generates torque. In a normal, wild-type spirochete, the flexibility of the protoplasmic cylinder and outer sheath allows this torque to cause the entire cell to twist, resulting in a corkscrew-like motion that propels the bacterium forward, especially through viscous environments.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of a spirochete. This strain possesses a mutation that leads to excessive cross-linking of proteins within its outer sheath, making the sheath significantly more rigid and resistant to bending and twisting. The axial filaments, including their motor proteins and power source, are entirely unaffected by the mutation and function normally.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the motility of this mutant spirochete compared to its wild-type counterpart?\n\nA. The cell will exhibit faster forward motion because the rigid sheath acts as a more efficient propeller.\n\nB. The cell will rotate about its long axis but will show little to no forward (translational) movement.\n\nC. The cell's motility will be unaffected, as the axial filaments are still functioning normally.\n\nD. The cell will move in a straight line instead of a corkscrew path, but at the same speed.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of a rigid outer sheath on the motility of a spirochete, given that its internal axial filaments function correctly.\n\nFirst, let's establish the normal mechanism of spirochete motility. The key components are the helical protoplasmic cylinder, the axial filaments (endoflagella) located in the periplasm, and the outer sheath. The axial filaments are anchored at the ends of the cell and rotate. This rotation generates a torque.\n\nThe crucial feature for spirochete propulsion is the flexibility of the entire cell body, particularly the protoplasmic cylinder and the outer sheath. When the internal axial filaments rotate in one direction, they exert a torque on the flexible, helical cell cylinder. By Newton's third law, the cell cylinder and outer sheath are compelled to rotate in the opposite direction. Because the cell is a flexible helix, this counter-rotation does not just spin the cell in place like a rigid rod. Instead, it causes the entire cell to twist and undulate, propagating a wave along its length. This corkscrew-like motion is what efficiently propels the spirochete through its environment.\n\nNow, let's consider the mutant described in the problem. The mutation causes the outer sheath to become significantly more rigid. The axial filaments still rotate normally, meaning they continue to generate torque.\n\nWhen these functional axial filaments rotate inside the now-rigid outer sheath, they still exert a torque on the cell body. However, because the outer sheath (and thus the entire cell structure) is now rigid and resistant to twisting and bending, it can no longer deform into the characteristic corkscrew wave. Instead of flexing, the now-rigid helical cell will behave more like a solid object. The torque from the internal flagella will cause the entire rigid cell body to rotate about its long axis in the opposite direction.\n\nThis rotation about its long axis, without the concurrent flexing and undulation, does not produce effective translational propulsion. The cell will essentially spin in place, much like a typical bacterium with a flagellum whose hook protein is broken, causing the filament to be rigid. Therefore, forward movement will be severely impaired or eliminated entirely.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\nA. The cell will exhibit faster forward motion because the rigid sheath acts as a more efficient propeller. This is incorrect. The propulsive force comes from the corkscrew deformation, not from the sheath acting as a stiff paddle. A lack of flexibility prevents this deformation.\n\nB. The cell will rotate about its long axis but will show little to no forward (translational) movement. This aligns perfectly with our reasoning. The torque from the endoflagella causes the rigid cell to spin without the undulations necessary for propulsion.\n\nC. The cell's motility will be unaffected, as the axial filaments are still functioning normally. This is incorrect because it ignores the critical role of the cell body's flexibility. Motility is a coordinated effort between the motor (axial filaments) and the body (sheath and cylinder).\n\nD. The cell will move in a straight line instead of a corkscrew path, but at the same speed. This is incorrect. The corkscrew path is a consequence of the propulsion mechanism itself. Eliminating the ability to flex and twist eliminates the primary mode of propulsion, so the cell will not move forward at the same speed, if at all.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2055357"}]}
