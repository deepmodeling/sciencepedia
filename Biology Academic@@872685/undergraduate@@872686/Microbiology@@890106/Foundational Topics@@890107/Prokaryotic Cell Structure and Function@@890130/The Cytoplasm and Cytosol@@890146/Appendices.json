An experiment is conducted where a sample of these bacteria is rapidly centrifuged and then immediately resuspended in a new sterile solution containing 10% NaCl.

The key principle governing this process is osmosis.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the initial state.**\nThe bacterium is initially in an isotonic solution (0.85% NaCl). This means the concentration of solutes inside the bacterium's cytoplasm is equal to the concentration of solutes in the external medium. Consequently, the water potential inside the cell is equal to the water potential outside the cell. There is no net movement of water across the plasma membrane, and the cell is in a state of equilibrium.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the new environment.**\nThe bacterium is transferred to a 10% NaCl solution. This solution has a much higher solute concentration than the bacterium's cytoplasm (which was isotonic with 0.85% NaCl). A solution with a higher solute concentration is defined as hypertonic relative to the cell. A higher solute concentration corresponds to a lower water potential. Therefore, the external environment now has a significantly lower water potential than the cytoplasm.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the principle of osmosis.**\nOsmosis is the net movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of higher water potential (lower solute concentration) to an area of lower water potential (higher solute concentration). In this scenario, the plasma membrane is the selectively permeable barrier. Since the water potential is higher inside the cell than outside, water will move out of the cytoplasm and into the external 10% NaCl solution.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the cellular consequence of water loss.**\nThe net efflux of water from the cytoplasm will cause the cytoplasm to lose volume and shrink. The plasma membrane, which is flexible, encloses the cytoplasm. As the cytoplasm shrinks, the plasma membrane will pull away from the rigid cell wall that surrounds it. This process is called **plasmolysis**. The cell wall itself is a rigid structure and does not collapse or shrink; it maintains the overall shape of the bacterium.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options.**\n- **A. The cell will ... undergo lysis.** Lysis (bursting) occurs when a cell takes in too much water. This happens in a *hypotonic* environment (lower external solute concentration), not a hypertonic one. This option is incorrect.\n- **B. The plasma membrane will shrink and pull away from the interior of the cell wall...** This accurately describes plasmolysis, the direct result of water loss from the cytoplasm in a hypertonic environment. This option is correct.\n- **C. No significant change will occur... as the rigid cell wall protects the cell.** The cell wall provides structural support but is permeable to water. It cannot prevent the osmotic movement of water across the plasma membrane. This option is incorrect.\n- **D. The cell wall will collapse inward...** The bacterial cell wall is designed to be rigid to resist internal turgor pressure; it does not collapse under external osmotic pressure. The volume change occurs within the plasma membrane. This option is incorrect.\n- **E. The cell will actively pump Na$^{+}$ ions into the cytoplasm...** Actively pumping ions *into* the cell would further lower the internal water potential, exacerbating water loss. To counteract the hypertonic environment, a cell would need to pump solutes *out*, but this process is neither immediate nor powerful enough to counteract such a drastic change from 0.85% to 10% NaCl and prevent water loss. This option describes the opposite of a compensatory response and is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the immediate and primary consequence is plasmolysis, where the plasma membrane and cytoplasm shrink away from the cell wall.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2097252"}, {"introduction": "Beyond being an osmotic bag, the cytoplasm possesses a remarkable degree of internal organization. This exercise investigates the role of the bacterial cytoskeleton, specifically the protein MreB, in establishing and maintaining cell shape. By considering the consequence of a non-functional MreB protein, you will learn how internal cytoplasmic structures actively direct processes like cell wall synthesis to create complex cellular morphologies [@problem_id:2097230].", "problem": "In a microbiology lab, a researcher is studying the bacterium *Bacillus subtilis*, which is naturally rod-shaped. The shape of this bacterium is maintained by its cell wall, but the synthesis of the cell wall material, peptidoglycan, is directed by a protein cytoskeleton within the cytoplasm. One of the key proteins in this process is MreB, a prokaryotic homolog of actin. The MreB protein polymerizes to form helical filaments that lie just beneath the cytoplasmic membrane and extend along the length of the cell.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *Bacillus subtilis* in which the gene for the MreB protein has been altered, rendering the protein completely non-functional. The mutant bacteria are cultured in a standard nutrient broth under ideal growth conditions for several generations. Which of the following options most accurately predicts the morphological outcome for the bacterial population and provides the correct underlying reason?\n\nA) The cells will become ovoid or spherical because peptidoglycan synthesis will occur in a dispersed, uncoordinated manner rather than being directed along a longitudinal axis.\n\nB) The cells will form long, non-septated filaments because the FtsZ ring, which is responsible for cell division, is destabilized by the absence of MreB.\n\nC) The cells will lyse due to osmotic pressure because the MreB protein is a primary structural component of the cell wall itself.\n\nD) The cells will become vibrio-shaped (curved rods) because the loss of MreB's rigid framework allows other asymmetric forces in the cell to dominate.\n\nE) The cells will remain rod-shaped but will be significantly shorter, as MreB is only responsible for cell elongation past a certain point, not for establishing the initial rod shape.", "solution": "We identify the relevant cellular components and their roles in bacterial morphology. In rod-shaped bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, the maintenance of rod shape depends on spatially organized peptidoglycan synthesis along the lateral cell wall. The cytoskeletal protein MreB, a prokaryotic homolog of actin, polymerizes into membrane-associated filaments that guide the localization and motion of peptidoglycan synthases, thereby directing insertion of new cell wall material in a circumferential pattern along the cell’s longitudinal axis. This spatial organization maintains anisotropic growth required for a rod shape.\n\nIf MreB is rendered non-functional, the directional cue for sidewall peptidoglycan synthesis is lost. In the absence of MreB, peptidoglycan insertion becomes isotropic or dispersed rather than organized along circumferential tracks. Isotropic cell wall growth yields a geometry that minimizes surface tension and strain for a given volume, which is a sphere. Empirically, MreB depletion or deletion in rod-shaped bacteria leads to a loss of rod shape and the emergence of ovoid or spherical cells, while viability can be maintained under non-stress conditions.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these principles:\n\n- Option A states that the cells will become ovoid or spherical because peptidoglycan synthesis becomes dispersed and uncoordinated rather than directed along a longitudinal axis. This matches the established role of MreB in directing anisotropic lateral wall synthesis. Loss of MreB removes the directional guidance, leading to isotropic insertion and spherical morphology. This is consistent with observations in Bacillus subtilis and other rod-shaped bacteria.\n\n- Option B claims long, non-septated filaments form due to destabilization of the FtsZ ring in the absence of MreB. FtsZ is a tubulin homolog that assembles the Z-ring at midcell to drive cytokinesis. While MreB and FtsZ can be functionally linked in some contexts, FtsZ polymerization and septation do not require MreB, and the hallmark phenotype of MreB loss is spherical cells, not filamentation from division failure. Therefore this is incorrect.\n\n- Option C claims lysis due to osmotic pressure because MreB is a primary structural component of the cell wall. MreB is not a peptidoglycan component; it is a cytoskeletal organizer. The cell wall is still synthesized, albeit mispatterned. Under ideal growth conditions and with an intact cell wall synthetic machinery, cells need not lyse solely from loss of MreB; they typically become spherical and can remain viable. Hence this is incorrect.\n\n- Option D suggests vibrio-shaped cells due to loss of MreB’s rigid framework allowing asymmetric forces to dominate. Vibrio curvature in bacteria such as Caulobacter crescentus is mediated by crescentin and specific asymmetric peptidoglycan insertion, not by a simple absence of MreB. Bacillus subtilis lacking MreB does not adopt a consistent curved-rod morphology; it becomes spherical. Thus this is incorrect.\n\n- Option E asserts cells remain rod-shaped but shorter, implying MreB only affects elongation past a certain point. In fact, MreB is essential for maintaining the rod shape itself via anisotropic wall synthesis. Without MreB, rods do not merely become shorter; they lose rod morphology and become spherical. Thus this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction and reasoning are given in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2097230"}, {"introduction": "The cytoplasm is also a highly controlled chemical reactor, with its redox state being a crucial parameter for many biochemical reactions. This advanced problem delves into the redox environment maintained by the glutathione system and its implications for biotechnology.

The proper folding and activity of this antibody fragment depend on the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. However, the bacterial cytoplasm is a strongly reducing environment, which prevents disulfide bond formation. This reducing state is primarily maintained by the glutathione system. In this system, reduced glutathione (GSH) is the abundant form, while the oxidized form, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), is kept at very low levels.\n\nThe cytoplasmic ratio of GSH to GSSG is determined by a dynamic steady state. GSSG is constantly being produced from GSH by various cellular oxidative processes at a constant rate, $R_{ox}$. In parallel, GSSG is enzymatically reduced back to GSH by the NADPH-dependent enzyme glutathione reductase (Gor). The rate of this reduction, $V_{red}$, can be modeled using Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to GSSG, assuming NADPH is saturating:\n$$V_{red} = \\frac{V_{max} [\\text{GSSG}]}{K_m + [\\text{GSSG}]}$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximum enzyme velocity and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant for GSSG.\n\nIn the wild-type *E. coli* strain, the system is in a steady state where the rate of GSSG production equals its rate of reduction. The key parameters for the wild-type strain are:\n1.  The steady-state ratio of concentrations is $([\\text{GSH}]/[\\text{GSSG}])_{WT} = 200$.\n2.

The total concentration of glutathione moieties in the cell, defined as $[G]_{total} = [\\text{GSH}] + 2[\\text{GSSG}]$, remains constant.\n\nTo create a more oxidizing environment that might allow disulfide bond formation, the researchers engineer a mutant strain. In this mutant, the expression of the *gor* gene is partially silenced, resulting in a reduction of the maximum velocity of glutathione reductase, $V_{max}$, by 80% compared to the wild-type. Assume that this modification does not change the background rate of GSSG production, $R_{ox}$.\n\nCalculate the new steady-state ratio of $([\\text{GSH}]/[\\text{GSSG}])_{MUT}$ in the engineered mutant strain.
