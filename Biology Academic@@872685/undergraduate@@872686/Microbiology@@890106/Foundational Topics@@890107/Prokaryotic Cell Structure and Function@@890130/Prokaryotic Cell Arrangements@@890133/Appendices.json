By understanding this fundamental principle, we can predict the final morphology of a bacterial colony from its division pattern. This first exercise invites you to apply this core concept to a classic scenario involving spherical bacteria (cocci) dividing along a single, consistent plane [@problem_id:2089108].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a novel species of bacterium isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Microscopic analysis confirms that the individual cells are spherical (cocci). Using time-lapse microscopy under controlled laboratory conditions, the microbiologist observes the pattern of cell division. The initial coccus undergoes binary fission to produce two daughter cells, which remain attached to each other. Subsequent rounds of cell division are observed to occur consistently along a single plane, parallel to the plane of the very first division. This process repeats for several generations, with all daughter cells remaining interconnected.\n\nBased on this specific and consistent pattern of cell division and adherence, which of the following options best describes the morphology of the cellular arrangement that would be predominantly observed in the culture?\n\nA. A two-dimensional, sheet-like cluster of cells, often described as resembling a cluster of grapes.\n\nB. A chain-like formation of cells.\n\nC. A cubical packet of eight cells.\n\nD. Pairs of cells.\n\nE. Tetrads, which are square-planar groups of four cells.", "solution": "We identify the governing biological principle: in cocci, the number and orientation of division planes, together with whether daughter cells detach, determine the resultant cellular arrangement.\n\n1. Given: spherical cells (cocci) undergo binary fission and daughter cells remain attached. Subsequent divisions occur consistently along a single plane, parallel to the first division, and all progeny remain interconnected through several generations.\n2. Biological mapping of division patterns to morphologies:\n   - Division in one plane with continued attachment across multiple generations produces linear chains (streptococci).\n   - Division in one plane with attachment after only the first division yields pairs (diplococci).\n   - Division in two perpendicular planes produces tetrads (square-planar groups of four).\n   - Division in three perpendicular planes produces cubical packets of eight or multiples of eight (sarcinae).\n   - Division in multiple random planes produces irregular, grape-like clusters (staphylococci).\n3. Applying this mapping to the observed pattern (single, consistent plane; continued attachment; multiple generations): the expected predominant arrangement is a chain-like formation of cells.\n\nTherefore, the best option is the chain-like formation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2089108"}, {"introduction": "While cocci can divide in multiple planes, rod-shaped bacteria (bacilli) are typically constrained to divide only across their short axis. This exercise explores the consequences of this constraint, even when a genetic mutation prevents cells from separating after division [@problem_id:2089088]. By analyzing this scenario, you will deepen your understanding of how cell shape dictates the potential for forming specific arrangements like chains (streptobacilli) while precluding others.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying cell division in *Bacillus subtilis*, a rod-shaped bacterium. The wild-type strain normally exists as single cells or occasional short chains. The researcher creates a mutant strain by knocking out a gene, designated *sepX*, which is essential for the final step of cleaving the septum that separates daughter cells after binary fission. As a result, in the mutant strain, cells remain attached to each other after division.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the resulting cellular arrangement in the *sepX* mutant and provides the correct underlying reason why this bacterium cannot form a sarcina-like packet?\n\nA. Staphylococcus, because division planes are random, leading to a grape-like cluster.\n\nB. Sarcina, because the blockage of separation forces the cells to stack into a cubical packet.\n\nC. Streptobacillus, because cell division is restricted to a single plane.\n\nD. Palisades, because the cells snap apart and then lie side-by-side due to post-fission motility.\n\nE. Tetrad, because division occurs in two perpendicular planes, but the mutation prevents formation of a larger packet.", "solution": "Bacillus subtilis is a rod-shaped bacterium (a bacillus). In bacilli, the cytokinetic ring and septum form in a single plane perpendicular to the long axis, so binary fission proceeds in one consistent plane. If the septal cleavage step is disabled (as in the sepX knockout), daughter cells do not separate after division. When division continues in the same single plane and cells remain attached, the result is a chain of rods aligned end-to-end, i.e., a streptobacillus arrangement.\n\nA sarcina-like packet requires divisions in three mutually perpendicular planes, which is a characteristic of certain cocci. Simply preventing separation does not change the intrinsic control of division planes. Because B. subtilis divides in only one plane and is rod-shaped, it cannot generate the cubical packets of sarcina; instead, it forms chains. Therefore, the correct identification is streptobacillus due to single-plane division, which also explains why a sarcina-like packet cannot form.\n\nOptions A, B, D, and E are inconsistent: A and B assume random or multi-plane divisions typical of cocci; D presupposes snapping separation (contradicted by the mutation preventing separation); E assumes two perpendicular planes (tetrads) found in some cocci, not in bacilli.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2089088"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond observation, modern synthetic biology aims to engineer cellular behavior by designing and implementing novel genetic circuits. This advanced problem challenges you to think like a bioengineer, using a mathematical model to control cellular arrangement at a quantitative level [@problem_id:2089126]. By manipulating the systems that guide cell division, you will determine the precise parameters needed to force bacteria to grow into a predetermined, non-natural spiral pattern, showcasing the predictive power of biophysical models.", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is designing a circuit to control the morphology of a colony of genetically engineered coccoid bacteria. These bacteria are modified to first elongate into a short rod before dividing precisely at their midpoint. The daughter cells remain attached, and their growth is constrained to a two-dimensional plane. The orientation of the new division plane relative to the previous one determines the colony's macroscopic shape.\n\nThe orientation is determined by the competition between two engineered FtsZ-ring positioning systems. The FtsZ ring, which determines the division plane, forms at the circumferential position $\\phi$ that maximizes a total potential, $P_{total}(\\phi)$. The angle $\\phi$ is measured in the plane of growth relative to the axis of the previous cell division.\n\n1.  **System 1 (Static Reference)**: This system is based on a protein, `RefA`, which marks the poles created by the previous division. It provides a static \"memory\" that encourages the cell to divide parallel to the last division, thus promoting chain formation. The potential associated with this system is given by $P_1(\\phi) = C_1 \\cos(2\\phi)$, where $C_1$ is a positive constant representing its strength.\n\n2.  **System 2 (Dynamic Rotator)**: This system uses a protein complex, `RotB`, which forms a focus that actively translocates around the cell's equator at a constant angular speed, $\\Omega$. This rotation starts at $\\phi=0$ at the moment of the cell's birth (time $t=0$). The `RotB` complex promotes FtsZ ring formation at its current location. Its potential is given by $P_2(\\phi, t) = C_2 \\cos(2(\\phi - \\Omega t))$, where $C_2$ is a positive constant representing its strength.\n\nThe bacterium has a fixed cell cycle period of $T_d$. The decision on where to place the new FtsZ ring is made, and division occurs, at time $t=T_d$. The total potential that is maximized is $P_{total}(\\phi) = P_1(\\phi) + P_2(\\phi, T_d)$.\n\nThe goal is to force the bacteria to grow into a stable spiral pattern, where each successive division plane is rotated by a constant angle of $\\theta_s = \\frac{\\pi}{5}$ radians with respect to the previous one. The engineers have tuned the `RotB` system such that the total rotational phase lag per cell cycle is $\\Omega T_d = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians.\n\nTo achieve the desired spiral morphology, what must be the value of the dimensionless ratio of the dynamic system strength to the static system strength, $r = \\frac{C_2}{C_1}$?\n\nRound your final answer to four significant figures.
