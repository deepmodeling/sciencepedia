The study utilizes a technique called Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). In this method, specific molecules in the membrane are first tagged with a fluorescent marker. A small, circular region of the cell surface is then exposed to a high-intensity laser beam, which irreversibly bleaches the fluorescent markers in that spot. The rate at which fluorescence returns to the bleached spot, due to the lateral movement of unbleached molecules from surrounding areas, is monitored.\n\nThe lateral diffusion coefficient, $D$, of the fluorescently tagged molecules can be determined from the characteristic half-recovery time, $\\tau$ (the time it takes for the fluorescence intensity in the center of the spot to reach half of its final recovery value), and the radius of the bleached spot, $w$. The relationship is given by the approximation:\n$$D = \\frac{w^2}{4 \\tau}$$\nFurthermore, for particles moving within the two-dimensional plane of the membrane, a simplified physical model relates the diffusion coefficient $D$ to the particle's effective hydrodynamic radius, $a$. This model states that the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to this radius:\n$$D = \\frac{C}{a}$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant that depends on the properties of the membrane (like viscosity) and the temperature, but not on the particle itself.\n\nThe microbiologist performs two experiments on the bacterium using a laser that creates a bleached spot of radius $w = 0.25 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n1.  In the first experiment, a fluorescent lipid analog with an effective hydrodynamic radius of $a_L = 0.50$ nm is used. The measured half-recovery time is $\\tau_L = 0.50$ s.\n2.  In the second experiment, a specific integral membrane protein is tagged. This protein and its associated complex have a combined effective hydrodynamic radius of $a_P = 5.0$ nm.\n\nAssuming the constant $C$ is the same in both experiments, calculate the expected half-recovery time, $\\tau_P$, for the integral membrane protein.

In the experiment, bacterial cells are placed in solutions containing varying external concentrations of the monosaccharide, and the initial rate of its transport into the cytoplasm is measured. The microbiologist observes that as the external concentration of the monosaccharide is increased, the initial rate of uptake also increases. However, beyond a certain high external concentration, the rate of uptake no longer increases and approaches a constant maximum value. This observation is characteristic of saturation kinetics.\n\nBased on this experimental finding, which of the following transport mechanisms could potentially be responsible for the uptake of this monosaccharide in this bacterium?
