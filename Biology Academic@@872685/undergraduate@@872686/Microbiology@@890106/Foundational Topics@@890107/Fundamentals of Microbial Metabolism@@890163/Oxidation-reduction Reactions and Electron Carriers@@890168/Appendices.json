For energy production, the bacterium utilizes a standard mitochondrial-like electron transport chain (ETC). During catabolism, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) is reduced to NADH. This NADH serves as the primary electron donor to Complex I of the ETC. Electrons are then transferred from Complex I to a mobile carrier, Coenzyme Q (CoQ), reducing it to CoQH2. The electrons are subsequently passed down through Complex III, Cytochrome c, and Complex IV, with molecular oxygen serving as the terminal electron acceptor.\n\nA researcher introduces Rotenone, a natural pesticide, into the actively respiring bacterial culture. Rotenone is known to be a potent and specific inhibitor that blocks the transfer of electrons from the iron-sulfur clusters within Complex I to Coenzyme Q. Assume the inhibitor's effect is instantaneous and that other metabolic pathways are not immediately activated.\n\nYour task is to determine the immediate effect of Rotenone on the redox states of the $\\text{NAD}^+/\\text{NADH}$ pool and the $\\text{CoQ}/\\text{CoQH}_2$ pool. In this context, \"more oxidized\" signifies an increase in the ratio of the oxidized form to the reduced form (e.g., an increase in [NAD+]/[NADH]), while \"more reduced\" signifies a decrease in this ratio.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the immediate shift in the redox states of these two pools after the addition of Rotenone?\n\nA. The $\\text{NAD}^+/\\text{NADH}$ pool becomes more oxidized, and the $\\text{CoQ}/\\text{CoQH}_2$ pool becomes more oxidized.\n\nB.

Both pools are unaffected as electron transport continues through Complex II.", "solution": "Define the oxidation ratios of the two pools as $R_{\\mathrm{NAD}}=\\frac{[\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}]}{[\\mathrm{NADH}]}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}=\\frac{[\\mathrm{CoQ}]}{[\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}]}$. By the problem’s definitions, an increase in $R$ means a shift to a more oxidized state, and a decrease in $R$ means a shift to a more reduced state.\n\nUnder normal operation, Complex I catalyzes the net reaction\n$$\n\\mathrm{NADH}+\\mathrm{H^{+}}+\\mathrm{CoQ}\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{NAD^{+}}+\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}.\n$$\nThus, electron flow from $\\mathrm{NADH}$ to $\\mathrm{CoQ}$ simultaneously oxidizes $\\mathrm{NADH}$ to $\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}$ (increasing $R_{\\mathrm{NAD}}$) and reduces $\\mathrm{CoQ}$ to $\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}$ (decreasing $R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$), while downstream complexes (III and IV) oxidize $\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}$ using $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ as the terminal electron acceptor via\n$$\n\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}+2\\,\\mathrm{cyt\\,c}_{ox}\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CoQ}+2\\,\\mathrm{cyt\\,c}_{red}+2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}}.\n$$\n\nRotenone blocks electron transfer from the iron–sulfur clusters of Complex I to $\\mathrm{CoQ}$, halting the reaction that oxidizes $\\mathrm{NADH}$ and reduces $\\mathrm{CoQ}$. Immediately upon inhibition:\n- The oxidation of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ at Complex I stops. Upstream catabolic processes continue to generate $\\mathrm{NADH}$ (assumption: no immediate activation of alternative pathways to consume $\\mathrm{NADH}$), so $[\\mathrm{NADH}]$ rises relative to $[\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}]$, which decreases $R_{\\mathrm{NAD}}=\\frac{[\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}]}{[\\mathrm{NADH}]}$. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}/\\mathrm{NADH}$ pool becomes more reduced.\n- The reduction of $\\mathrm{CoQ}$ by Complex I ceases, while downstream oxidation of existing $\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}$ by Complex III and IV continues in the presence of $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$. This consumption of $\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}$ without replenishment from Complex I increases $\\frac{[\\mathrm{CoQ}]}{[\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}]}=R_{\\mathrm{Q}}$. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{CoQ}/\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}$ pool becomes more oxidized.\n\nAlthough Complex II can feed electrons into $\\mathrm{CoQ}$ from $\\mathrm{FADH_{2}}$ (succinate dehydrogenase), the problem asks for the immediate effect and specifies no immediate activation of other pathways. The defining immediate consequence of the Complex I block is accumulation of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ (more reduced) and net oxidation of the $\\mathrm{CoQ}$ pool due to ongoing downstream oxidation without input from Complex I. Hence, the correct statement is that the $\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}/\\mathrm{NADH}$ pool becomes more reduced and the $\\mathrm{CoQ}/\\mathrm{CoQH_{2}}$ pool becomes more oxidized.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2083647"}, {"introduction": "Electron transport and ATP synthesis are biochemically linked, but functionally distinct processes.
