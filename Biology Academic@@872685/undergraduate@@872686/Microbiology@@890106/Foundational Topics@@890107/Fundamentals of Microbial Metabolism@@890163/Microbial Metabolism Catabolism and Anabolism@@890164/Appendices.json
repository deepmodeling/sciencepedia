This bacterium relies exclusively on the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (glycolysis) for glucose catabolism. Laboratory experiments reveal that Compound X acts as a potent non-competitive inhibitor of Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate.

Upstream enzymes, namely hexokinase/glucokinase and phosphoglucose isomerase, continue to convert glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and then to F6P:\n$$\\text{Glucose} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Hexokinase}} \\text{Glucose-6-phosphate} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Phosphoglucose isomerase}} \\text{Fructose-6-phosphate}.$$\nBecause the consumption of F6P by the inhibited PFK-1 is decreased while its production from G6P continues, the immediate kinetic consequence is accumulation of the direct substrate of the inhibited step, F6P. Downstream intermediates such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate would decrease, not accumulate. Although prolonged accumulation of F6P can secondarily lead to increases in G6P (via the reversible isomerase) and potentially affect glucose levels via feedback on transport and phosphorylation, the first significant rise occurs in F6P, the immediate precursor at the inhibited step.\n\nTherefore, the first metabolic intermediate to significantly accumulate is fructose-6-phosphate.\n\nThus the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2080412"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of pathway regulation, this problem examines the consequences of its failure by analyzing a \"futile cycle\" where opposing catabolic and anabolic reactions run simultaneously [@problem_id:2080384].

However, a point mutation in a global regulatory gene has unexpectedly led to the constitutive, high-level activity of two key metabolic enzymes: Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) and Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-1). This means both enzymes operate at a high, constant rate, regardless of the cell's energetic state.\n\nThe mutant bacteria are grown in a chemostat under controlled conditions where glucose is the sole carbon source. It is observed that over a one-hour period, the culture consumes a total of 0.75 moles of glucose. Assume that all consumed glucose is immediately phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate and subsequently isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate, entering a metabolic loop governed by the two aforementioned enzymes. On average, each molecule of fructose-6-phosphate that enters this loop undergoes 12 complete cycles of conversion to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and back to fructose-6-phosphate before being diverted to other metabolic pathways.\n\nCalculate the net consumption of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) by this specific metabolic loop in the entire bacterial culture during this one-hour period.

The culture is maintained under strictly aerobic conditions with a constant supply of glucose as the sole carbon and energy source. The primary mechanism for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) production in this organism under these conditions is oxidative phosphorylation. The microbiologist measures two key metabolic rates: the rate of oxygen consumption (as a proxy for the rate of the electron transport chain) and the net rate of ATP synthesis.\n\nAfter establishing a steady baseline for both rates, the microbiologist introduces a chemical agent, 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP), into the culture medium.
