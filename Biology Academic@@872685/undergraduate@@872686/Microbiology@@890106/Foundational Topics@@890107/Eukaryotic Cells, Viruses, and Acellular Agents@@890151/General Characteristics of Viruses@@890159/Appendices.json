To determine their basic structural and genomic properties, the virologist subjects purified stocks of each virus to three different treatments. After each treatment, the infectivity of the viral preparation is tested on a susceptible host cell line. The treatments and their results are summarized below:\n\n1.  **Treatment with deoxyribonuclease (DNAse):** This enzyme specifically degrades DNA molecules.\n    *   Isolate V-1: All infectivity is lost.\n    *   Isolate V-2: Infectivity remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Treatment with ribonuclease (RNAse):** This enzyme specifically degrades RNA molecules.\n    *   Isolate V-1: Infectivity remains unchanged.\n    *   Isolate V-2: All infectivity is lost.\n\n3.  **Treatment with ether:** This organic solvent disrupts lipid membranes.\n    *   Isolate V-1: Infectivity remains unchanged.\n    *   Isolate V-2: All infectivity is lost.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the two viral isolates?\n\nA. Isolate V-1 is an enveloped DNA virus, and Isolate V-2 is a non-enveloped RNA virus.\n\nB. Isolate V-1 is a non-enveloped DNA virus, and Isolate V-2 is an enveloped RNA virus.\n\nC. Isolate V-1 is an enveloped RNA virus, and Isolate V-2 is a non-enveloped DNA virus.\n\nD. Isolate V-1 is a non-enveloped RNA virus, and Isolate V-2 is an enveloped DNA virus.\n\nE. Both Isolate V-1 and Isolate V-2 are enveloped viruses.\n\nF. Both Isolate V-1 and Isolate V-2 are non-enveloped viruses.", "solution": "We use three fundamental principles. First, deoxyribonuclease specifically degrades DNA and does not affect RNA; ribonuclease specifically degrades RNA and does not affect DNA. Loss of infectivity after treatment with a nuclease indicates that the viral genome required for initiating infection is of the corresponding nucleic acid type. Second, intact virions can be variably susceptible to nucleases depending on whether their genomes are accessible; in the classical diagnostic setup of this problem, selective loss of infectivity with DNAse versus RNAse is used to infer whether the viral genome is DNA or RNA. Third, ether disrupts lipid bilayers; enveloped viruses require an intact lipid envelope for infectivity and are ether sensitive, whereas non-enveloped viruses lack a lipid membrane and are ether resistant.\n\nApply these to Isolate V-1. DNAse treatment causes complete loss of infectivity, while RNAse has no effect. By the nuclease specificity principle, this pattern indicates a DNA genome. Ether treatment does not reduce infectivity, indicating resistance to lipid disruption, which characterizes non-enveloped viruses. Therefore, Isolate V-1 is a non-enveloped DNA virus.\n\nApply these to Isolate V-2. DNAse has no effect, whereas RNAse abolishes infectivity, indicating an RNA genome. Ether eliminates infectivity, which implies dependence on a lipid envelope and thus an enveloped virion. Therefore, Isolate V-2 is an enveloped RNA virus.\n\nComparing to the options, this corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2068455"}, {"introduction": "The replication strategy of a virus is directly dictated by the nature of its genome. This problem [@problem_id:2068420] presents a classic virological puzzle: a viral RNA genome is not infectious on its own, but the complete virus particle is. Solving this requires an understanding of the Baltimore classification system and reveals why some viruses must come pre-packaged with their own enzymes to successfully hijack the host cell's machinery.", "problem": "Researchers have isolated a novel pathogenic virus. Through genomic analysis, they determine that its genetic material is a single strand of RNA. When this viral RNA is artificially introduced into the cytoplasm of a susceptible host cell a process known as transfection, no viral proteins are produced. However, when the intact viral particle, or virion, infects a host cell, the viral life cycle proceeds, and viral proteins are synthesized successfully. Host cells, by default, perform protein synthesis by translating messenger RNA (mRNA), which is considered a positive-sense RNA molecule, using their own ribosomes. The central dogma of molecular biology within the host is the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following essential components must the virus package within its mature virion, in addition to its genome and capsid proteins, to initiate a successful infection?\n\nA. Reverse transcriptase\n\nB. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase\n\nC. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase\n\nD. Ribosomes\n\nE. A DNA primase", "solution": "The host translation machinery can directly translate only positive-sense RNA, which functions as mRNA. If a viral genome is positive-sense single-stranded RNA, purified genomic RNA introduced into the cytoplasm can be directly loaded onto host ribosomes and translated into viral proteins. In the scenario described, when the isolated viral RNA is transfected into the cytoplasm, no viral proteins are produced, whereas infection with intact virions leads to successful protein synthesis. This implies that the viral RNA genome is not directly translatable and therefore is not positive-sense mRNA.\n\nFor a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is not directly translatable (for example, a negative-sense RNA virus or a virus requiring transcription of its RNA into a positive-sense RNA), the first essential step after entry is synthesis of positive-sense RNA that can serve as mRNA. Host cells do not possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; they have DNA-dependent RNA polymerases that transcribe DNA into RNA. Therefore, an RNA virus that requires RNA-to-RNA transcription must supply its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase within the virion so that, upon entry, it can synthesize positive-sense mRNA from its genomic RNA, enabling translation to begin.\n\nThis reasoning explains the observation: the intact virion provides the necessary enzyme, allowing mRNA production and subsequent protein synthesis, whereas naked genomic RNA lacks this enzyme and cannot initiate translation.\n\nEliminating the alternatives:\n- Reverse transcriptase is required for retroviruses to make DNA from RNA; however, retroviral genomic RNA is positive-sense and typically can be translated by host ribosomes, so the absence of any protein synthesis from the transfected RNA argues against this.\n- DNA-dependent RNA polymerase acts on DNA templates and is a host nuclear enzyme, not applicable to RNA genome transcription in the cytoplasm.\n- Ribosomes are provided by the host and are not packaged by standard RNA viruses.\n- DNA primase is involved in DNA replication and is irrelevant to an RNA virus initiating infection.\n\nTherefore, the essential packaged component is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2068420"}, {"introduction": "The intricate mechanisms of viral replication and assembly often leave unique structural fingerprints on the viral genome itself. This advanced exercise [@problem_id:2068480] challenges you to work backward from key experimental findings, such as terminal redundancy and cyclic permutation in a bacteriophage's DNA. By synthesizing these clues, you can deduce the sophisticated \"headful\" packaging model, a powerful illustration of how molecular evidence is used to reconstruct complex biological processes.", "problem": "A virologist is studying a newly discovered tailed bacteriophage, named Virionex-Z. The investigation focuses on the structure and replication strategy of its genome. The following key observations have been made from a large, synchronized population of Virionex-Z virions:\n\n1.  The genome extracted from mature virions is a linear, double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecule of a consistent length.\n2.  When the entire population of extracted linear genomes is denatured by heat and then allowed to slowly re-anneal, a significant fraction of the molecules form circular double-stranded DNA. Crucially, each of these resulting circles has a small single-stranded region (a \"tail\" or \"whisker\") at the point of circularization, indicating that the original linear molecules possess terminal redundancy.\n3.  Restriction mapping analysis is performed on the DNA population extracted from the virions. The results show that although the order of genes is conserved across all genomes, the terminal nucleotides of the linear genomes are different for different individual virions. This indicates that the collection of genomes is cyclically permuted. For a hypothetical gene order A-B-C-D, virions could contain genomes such as A-B-C-D-A', B-C-D-A'-B', or C-D-A'-B'-C', where A', B', and C' represent the redundant terminal regions corresponding to the start of the sequence.\n\nBased on these empirical findings, which of the following molecular models most accurately and completely explains the mechanism of Virionex-Z genome replication and packaging?\n\nA. The phage genome is replicated as a long concatemer (a series of genomes linked end-to-end). Packaging into a prohead is initiated at a specific packaging site (`pac`). The terminase enzyme complex loads DNA into the prohead until it is physically full, a process which accommodates slightly more than one unit-length genome. The DNA is then cleaved. The next packaging event begins at or near the site of the previous cleavage, proceeding into the next prohead.\n\nB. The phage genome circularizes upon entering the host cell and replicates via theta replication to produce numerous circular daughter genomes. For packaging, a host endonuclease cleaves each circular genome at a single, random location to linearize it. A phage-encoded terminal transferase enzyme then adds a short, predefined redundant sequence to both ends of the linear molecule before it is packaged.\n\nC. The phage genome circularizes upon entry and replicates via rolling-circle replication to produce a long concatemer. Packaging is initiated when a terminase enzyme recognizes and cleaves a specific site (`cos` site) within the concatemer. The enzyme then packages one unit-length of DNA into a prohead until it encounters the next `cos` site in the sequence, at which point it cleaves the DNA again, terminating packaging.\n\nD. The phage genome is maintained as a linear molecule within the host cell. It is replicated bidirectionally from a central origin of replication, producing two linear daughter genomes. During packaging, a specialized enzyme complex recognizes both ends of the linear genome, duplicates the initial 3% of the sequence, and ligates this duplicated piece to the terminus of the molecule before it is inserted into the prohead.\n\nE. The phage genome replicates as independent linear units. These units then undergo homologous recombination with each other at random points to form long, partially branched concatemers. Packaging is initiated by cleavage at a random location in the concatemer, and a unit length of DNA is spooled into the prohead before a final non-specific cut is made.", "solution": "We proceed by deducing, from each observation, the necessary features of the replication and packaging mechanism, and then matching those features to the options.\n\nFirst, the genomes in mature virions are linear, double-stranded DNA of consistent length. This is compatible with both headful packaging (which yields a narrowly distributed, slightly larger-than-unit genome defined by capsid capacity) and cos-site packaging (which yields precisely one unit length). It is not uniquely diagnostic by itself.\n\nSecond, when denatured and slowly re-annealed, a significant fraction of molecules form circular duplex DNA with a small single-stranded segment at the join. This finding indicates terminal redundancy: the ends contain overlapping homologous sequences such that intramolecular base pairing between terminal repeats circularizes the molecule, but because the repeats overlap only part of the terminal sequences, a small unpaired single-stranded “whisker” remains. This outcome is characteristic of headful-packaged, terminally redundant genomes (as in phage T4 and P22). In contrast, cos-site cohesive-end genomes (e.g., lambda) re-anneal their complementary cohesive ends to form circles without a single-stranded whisker at the junction; their ends are precise and identical across particles, not terminally redundant.\n\nThird, restriction mapping reveals conserved gene order but differing terminal nucleotides among individual virions—i.e., cyclic permutation across the population. Cyclic permutation arises when packaging initiates at a specific site on a concatemer (often a pac site), after which the terminase fills the capsid to capacity (headful), makes a cut, and the next packaging event begins at or near the previous cut into the next head. Because cuts after the first are not tied to a unique map position but to head capacity, each particle starts and ends at different positions around the circular genetic map, yielding cyclic permutations. Cos-site packaging, by contrast, produces fixed ends at defined cos sites and therefore would not produce cyclic permutation across the population.\n\nNow evaluate each option against the three required features: terminal redundancy, cyclic permutation, and a mechanistic basis consistent with known phage biology.\n\n- Option A: Replication as long concatemers; packaging initiates at a specific pac site; terminase loads DNA until the head is physically full (slightly more than one genome length), then cleaves; subsequent packaging begins at or near the previous cleavage. This headful mechanism directly explains terminal redundancy (because more than a unit length is packaged) and cyclic permutation (because, after the first pac-initiated head, subsequent heads start at shifting positions along the concatemer). The consistent linear length reflects the head capacity. This fully matches all observations.\n\n- Option B: Circular theta replication; random host endonuclease linearization; phage terminal transferase adds a predefined redundant sequence. This would produce identical, predefined terminal redundancies across virions, not variable terminal nucleotides. It does not naturally yield cyclic permutation tied to packaging and would predict uniform ends after addition, contradicting the mapping result. It also invokes a host random cut and a specific added redundancy that are biologically implausible for tailed phages.\n\n- Option C: Rolling-circle concatemer replication; terminase recognizes a cos site and packages exactly one unit length to the next cos, then cleaves. This produces identical, precise ends and unit-length genomes without terminal redundancy and without cyclic permutation among particles. It contradicts the observed terminal redundancy and cyclic permutation.\n\n- Option D: Linear maintenance; bidirectional replication from a central origin; an enzyme duplicates the initial small fraction and ligates it to the terminus before packaging. This predicts a fixed duplicated segment and fixed ends across virions, incompatible with cyclic permutation and the observed variability of terminal nucleotides.\n\n- Option E: Independent linear units recombine to branched concatemers; random initiation; one unit length spooled before a nonspecific cut. Packaging of exactly one unit length would not generate terminal redundancy, and random initiation without a defined pac site would not, by itself, generate the systematic cyclic permutation seen across the population. The lack of terminal redundancy contradicts observation two.\n\nTherefore, only Option A simultaneously and mechanistically accounts for terminal redundancy, cyclic permutation, and the observed consistent linear DNA length through headful packaging initiated at a pac site on concatemers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2068480"}]}
