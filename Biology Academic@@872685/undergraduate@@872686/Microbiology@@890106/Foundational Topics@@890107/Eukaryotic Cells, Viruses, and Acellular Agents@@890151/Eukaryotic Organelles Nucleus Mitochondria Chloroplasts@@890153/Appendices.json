This exercise demonstrates how the fundamental structural differences between large, linear nuclear chromosomes and small, circular mitochondrial DNA result in different behaviors in a standard laboratory procedure. By predicting the outcome of a gel electrophoresis experiment, you will connect abstract knowledge of DNA topology to a tangible, visual result, a core skill in molecular biology [@problem_id:2064716].", "problem": "A microbiologist is working with the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and aims to visually distinguish its nuclear Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) from its mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using a common laboratory technique. The procedure involves first gently lysing the yeast cells. Subsequently, two subcellular fractions are isolated using differential centrifugation: one fraction is highly enriched for nuclei, and the other is highly enriched for mitochondria. The total DNA is then carefully purified from each of these two fractions, a process designed to minimize fragmentation and preserve the natural topology of the DNA molecules.\n\nAn equal amount of DNA from the nuclear fraction (Sample N) and the mitochondrial fraction (Sample M) is loaded into separate wells of an agarose gel. Electrophoresis is then carried out, and the gel is stained to visualize the DNA.\n\nBased on the fundamental structural differences between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in eukaryotes, which of the following options most accurately describes the expected result seen on the stained gel?\n\nA. The lane containing Sample N will show a single band that has migrated significantly farther down the gel than the single band from Sample M.\n\nB. Both lanes for Sample N and Sample M will show a continuous smear of DNA from the top to the bottom of the gel, rendering them indistinguishable.\n\nC. The lane containing Sample M will display a pattern of multiple, distinct bands, whereas the lane containing Sample N will show one very bright, high-molecular-weight band that has barely migrated from the loading well.\n\nD. The lane containing Sample M will show a single, sharp band, while the lane for Sample N will show a distinct ladder of bands corresponding to the different asexually-reproducing yeast chromosomes.\n\nE. Both lanes will show a pattern of multiple bands, but the bands in the lane for Sample M will be located much farther down the gel than the bands in the lane for Sample N.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the relevant structural differences between the DNA sources.\n- In eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nuclear DNA is organized into multiple linear chromosomes with very high molecular weights (megabase scale). When purified gently to preserve integrity, these long linear molecules remain largely intact.\n- Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in yeast is typically circular and present in many copies per cell. Critically, intact circular DNA exists in multiple topological forms: covalently closed supercoiled circles, relaxed (nicked) open circles, linearized circles, and higher-order concatenated or dimeric species.\n\nStep 2: State the physical principle governing agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA.\n- Agarose gel electrophoresis separates DNA based on size and conformation under an applied electric field. For linear DNA, mobility decreases with increasing length, approximately following a log-linear dependence over a workable size range; extremely large linear DNA (megabase-sized chromosomes) typically fails to enter the gel and remains near the well as a high-molecular-weight mass.\n- For circular DNA, mobility depends on both size and topology. At the same molecular weight, supercoiled DNA migrates faster (appears lower in the gel) than linear DNA, while nicked (relaxed) circular DNA migrates more slowly (appears higher in the gel). Consequently, intact circular DNA often appears as multiple discrete bands corresponding to different topological forms.\n\nStep 3: Predict the pattern for the nuclear fraction (Sample N).\n- Because the nuclear DNA consists of intact, extremely large linear chromosomes and the preparation minimizes fragmentation, the bulk of the DNA will barely enter the gel, forming a very bright, high-molecular-weight band that remains at or just below the loading well, rather than resolving into discrete bands on a standard agarose gel.\n- A distinct ladder of chromosome-sized bands would require pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, not a standard agarose gel.\n\nStep 4: Predict the pattern for the mitochondrial fraction (Sample M).\n- The mtDNA is circular and exists in multiple topological forms. Under conditions that preserve native topology, these forms resolve into multiple distinct bands: a fast-migrating supercoiled band, a slower-migrating nicked/relaxed circular band, and potentially linear and higher-order species. Therefore, Sample M will display multiple discrete bands rather than a single band or a smear.\n\nStep 5: Match predictions to the provided options.\n- Option C states that Sample M shows multiple distinct bands (consistent with mtDNA topoisomers), and Sample N shows one very bright, high-molecular-weight band that has barely migrated from the loading well (consistent with intact nuclear chromosomes on a standard gel). This aligns with the physical principles and structural differences described above.\n- Other options are inconsistent: A reverses expected mobilities; B predicts indistinguishable smears despite preserved topology; D incorrectly predicts a single sharp mtDNA band and a nuclear chromosome ladder (the latter requires pulsed-field conditions); E incorrectly predicts multiple bands for the nuclear fraction on a standard gel and places mtDNA bands uniformly farther down without acknowledging topological heterogeneity.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2064716"}, {"introduction": "The primary role of mitochondria is to serve as the cell's powerhouses, generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. This process hinges on maintaining a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, a concept known as chemiosmosis. This problem challenges you to predict the bioenergetic consequences of disrupting this gradient in a photosynthetic organism, forcing a distinction between mitochondrial respiration and chloroplast-based photosynthesis [@problem_id:2064705]. Working through this scenario illuminates the indispensability of mitochondrial integrity for cellular energy homeostasis, especially when photosynthesis is inactive.", "problem": "A species of unicellular photosynthetic alga, *Chlamydomonas energenesis*, is being studied for its metabolic capabilities. Like most photosynthetic eukaryotes, its cells contain both chloroplasts, for carrying out photosynthesis, and mitochondria, for cellular respiration. A researcher introduces a synthetic lipophilic compound, called \"protonoporin,\" to a culture of these algae. This compound specifically inserts into the inner mitochondrial membrane and forms channels that allow protons ($H^+$) to pass through freely. The compound has no effect on any other membrane in the cell, including the thylakoid membranes within the chloroplasts.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary bioenergetic crisis the cell would face as an immediate consequence of exposure to protonoporin?\n\nA. The cell would be unable to generate any ATP, as the proton gradients required for both photosynthesis and respiration would be destroyed, leading to rapid cell death.\n\nB. The rate of photosynthetic carbon fixation via the Calvin cycle would dramatically increase to produce excess glucose, which could then be used to generate ATP through glycolysis alone.\n\nC. The cell would lose the ability to synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, severely compromising its energy supply for general cellular functions, particularly during the night.\n\nD. The accumulation of protons in the mitochondrial matrix would cause a sharp drop in pH, denaturing the enzymes of the Krebs cycle and halting it completely.\n\nE. The electron transport chains in both the mitochondria and chloroplasts would stop functioning, as their activity is directly coupled to proton pumping.", "solution": "We analyze the immediate bioenergetic consequences of a compound that inserts exclusively into the inner mitochondrial membrane and renders it highly permeable to $H^{+}$.\n\n1) Chemiosmotic requirement for oxidative phosphorylation:\n- In mitochondria, the electron transport chain (ETC) pumps $H^{+}$ from the matrix to the intermembrane space, establishing a proton motive force (PMF) across the inner membrane. The PMF can be written symbolically as\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[H^{+}]_{\\mathrm{matrix}}}{[H^{+}]_{\\mathrm{IMS}}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\psi$ is the membrane potential (matrix relative to intermembrane space), $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n- ATP synthase uses $\\Delta p$ to drive the reaction $ADP + P_{i} \\to ATP$. The flux through ATP synthase requires a nonzero $\\Delta p$, and its rate increases with $\\Delta p$.\n\n2) Effect of a proton channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane:\n- A freely permeable proton channel collapses both the electrical and chemical components of $\\Delta p$ by allowing $H^{+}$ to move down its electrochemical gradient. In the limit of very high proton conductance,\n$$\n\\Delta \\psi \\to 0,\\quad [H^{+}]_{\\mathrm{matrix}} \\to [H^{+}]_{\\mathrm{IMS}},\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta p \\to 0.\n$$\n- With $\\Delta p \\to 0$, mitochondrial ATP synthase cannot synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Electron transport itself, however, does not require ATP synthase; in fact, with the backpressure of the proton gradient relieved, the ETC can continue (often at an increased rate) so long as substrates and oxygen are available. Thus, the primary failure is ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation, not electron transport.\n\n3) Specificity to mitochondria and exclusion of chloroplast effects:\n- The problem states that the compound has no effect on any membrane other than the inner mitochondrial membrane, explicitly sparing the thylakoid membranes. Therefore, photosynthetic photophosphorylation and the chloroplast ETC remain functional in the light. This rules out any immediate collapse of photosynthetic ATP production.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because chloroplast thylakoid proton gradients are unaffected, and substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle remains. The cell is not immediately unable to generate any ATP.\n- B is incorrect because there is no mechanistic basis for a dramatic increase in Calvin cycle carbon fixation as a compensatory response to mitochondrial uncoupling; moreover, glycolysis alone cannot typically compensate for the large ATP shortfall from loss of oxidative phosphorylation.\n- C is correct: the loss of mitochondrial $\\Delta p$ abolishes ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation. This is the primary immediate bioenergetic crisis, especially consequential in darkness, when photosynthetic ATP production ceases and the cell relies on mitochondria.\n- D is incorrect: while proton leak will acidify the matrix relative to normal by collapsing the usual alkaline matrix pH, cellular buffering and continued proton pumping prevent the kind of sharp, denaturing pH drop claimed; moreover, the Krebs cycle does not halt primarily for this reason.\n- E is incorrect because the ETC can continue operating when uncoupled; in chloroplasts it is unaffected by the compound.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the immediate, primary bioenergetic crisis is the loss of ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2064705"}, {"introduction": "Mitochondria are not static, isolated organelles; they form a dynamic, interconnected network that constantly undergoes fusion and fission. This practice delves into the functional significance of these dynamics, specifically the role of mitochondrial fusion in repairing damaged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). By analyzing quantitative data from a yeast genetics experiment, you will employ a powerful research logic to test a hypothesis and measure the precise contribution of a molecular process to a critical cellular maintenance task [@problem_id:2064745].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the maintenance of mitochondrial genome integrity in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The central hypothesis is that mitochondrial fusion allows for the functional complementation and subsequent repair of damaged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by pooling resources from different mitochondria within the same cell.\n\nTo test this, an experiment is designed using two haploid yeast strains of opposite mating types ('a' and 'alpha'):\n1.  A wild-type (WT) strain, which has a fully functional mitochondrial fusion-fission machinery.\n2.  A mutant strain, `fzo1Δ`, which lacks the Fzo1 protein, a key GTPase required for outer mitochondrial membrane fusion, rendering it incapable of mitochondrial fusion.\n\nFor each strain (WT and `fzo1Δ`), two distinct populations are prepared:\n-   **Population A:** Treated with a hypothetical mutagen that induces a high frequency of non-functional mutations specifically in the `COX2` gene of the mtDNA.\n-   **Population B:** Treated with a different mutagen that induces a high frequency of non-functional mutations specifically in the `ATP6` gene of the mtDNA.\n\nBoth `COX2` and `ATP6` are essential for cellular respiration. A cell can only grow on a non-fermentable carbon source like glycerol if it possesses at least one functional copy of both genes within its mitochondrial network.\n\nTwo separate mating experiments are performed:\n1.  **WT Cross:** Haploid WT cells from Population A (mating type 'a') are mixed with haploid WT cells from Population B (mating type 'alpha').\n2.  **`fzo1Δ` Cross:** Haploid `fzo1Δ` cells from Population A (mating type 'a') are mixed with haploid `fzo1Δ` cells from Population B (mating type 'alpha').\n\nAfter mating, diploid cells are formed, which now contain mitochondria from both parent cells in a common cytoplasm. These diploid cells are then plated on a selective medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source. Only diploid cells that have successfully restored respiratory function (i.e., have functional `COX2` and `ATP6` products) can form colonies.\n\nThe following data were collected:\n-   For the **WT Cross**, plating a total of $N_{\\text{total, WT}} = 5.20 \\times 10^5$ diploid cells resulted in $N_{\\text{repaired, WT}} = 8463$ respiratory-competent colonies.\n-   For the **`fzo1Δ` Cross**, plating a total of $N_{\\text{total, mut}} = 4.95 \\times 10^5$ diploid cells resulted in $N_{\\text{repaired, mut}} = 152$ respiratory-competent colonies.\n\nThe frequency of respiratory recovery for a given cross is defined as the number of respiratory-competent colonies divided by the total number of diploid cells plated. Let $f_{\\text{WT}}$ be this frequency for the WT cross and $f_{\\text{mut}}$ for the `fzo1Δ` cross.\n\nTo quantify the contribution of mitochondrial fusion to the repair process, calculate the **Fusion-Dependent Repair Index (FDRI)**, defined as:\n$$ \\text{FDRI} = \\frac{f_{\\text{WT}} - f_{\\text{mut}}}{f_{\\text{WT}}} $$\nThis index represents the fraction of the observed recovery in wild-type cells that is attributable to the Fzo1-mediated fusion process.\n\nCalculate the value of the FDRI.
