{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding transport begins with the most fundamental currency of life: water. The movement of water across a semipermeable membrane, driven by differences in solute concentration, is a powerful physical force known as osmosis. This practice explores the dramatic, yet predictable, consequences of this force when a walled eukaryotic cell, such as a fungus, is exposed to a hypertonic environment, leading to a process called plasmolysis. Mastering this concept is key to understanding how microorganisms survive in diverse osmotic conditions. [@problem_id:2097981]", "problem": "A eukaryotic fungal cell, which possesses a semipermeable plasma membrane and is enclosed by a rigid cell wall primarily composed of chitin, is placed into an aqueous solution with a very high concentration of sodium chloride. The initial concentration of solutes inside the fungal cytoplasm is significantly lower than that of the external sodium chloride solution. Assuming the cell wall is impermeable to the salt but freely permeable to water, and the plasma membrane is permeable to water but not to sodium chloride, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate physical consequence for the cell?\n\nA. Water will rush into the cell, causing it to swell and ultimately lyse (burst) due to the high osmotic pressure.\n\nB. The entire cell, including the cell wall, will uniformly shrink and shrivel, a process known as crenation.\n\nC. Water will exit the cell, causing the cytoplasm to lose volume and the plasma membrane to pull away from the stationary cell wall.\n\nD. The influx of water will cause the plasma membrane to press tightly against the cell wall, significantly increasing the cell's turgor pressure.\n\nE. The high salt concentration will chemically dissolve the chitin cell wall, leading to the collapse and lysis of the unprotected protoplast.", "solution": "Let the intracellular solute concentration be $C_{\\text{in}}$ and the extracellular sodium chloride concentration be $C_{\\text{out}}$, with $C_{\\text{out}} \\gg C_{\\text{in}}$. The plasma membrane is permeable to water but not to sodium chloride; the cell wall is rigid and, by assumption, does not allow sodium chloride to pass but allows water to equilibrate across it. Therefore, sodium chloride acts as an osmotically active solute across the plasma membrane.\n\nBy the van’t Hoff relation for dilute solutions, the osmotic pressure is\n$$\n\\Pi = i R T C,\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the van’t Hoff factor for the solute, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $C$ is the molar concentration of osmotically active particles. The osmotic pressure difference across the plasma membrane is then\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{\\text{out}} - \\Pi_{\\text{in}} = i R T \\left(C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{in}}\\right) > 0,\n$$\nbecause $C_{\\text{out}} \\gg C_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nThe net water flux across a semipermeable membrane can be written as\n$$\nJ_{w} = L_{p}\\left(\\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\Pi\\right),\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic permeability, $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{in}} - P_{\\text{out}}$ is the hydrostatic pressure difference across the plasma membrane, and $\\sigma$ is the reflection coefficient for the solute (with $\\sigma \\approx 1$ here because sodium chloride cannot cross the membrane). Initially, the hydrostatic pressure difference cannot counterbalance the large osmotic term because $C_{\\text{out}} \\gg C_{\\text{in}}$, so with $\\sigma \\approx 1$ and $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$, one has\n$$\nJ_{w} = L_{p}\\left(\\Delta P - \\Delta \\Pi\\right) < 0\n$$\nif the inward flux is taken as positive. Thus, water exits the cell.\n\nAs water leaves the cytoplasm, the protoplast (cytoplasm plus plasma membrane) loses volume. Because the fungal cell wall is rigid and does not collapse, the cell wall remains essentially stationary in size and shape. The loss of volume in the protoplast causes the plasma membrane to detach locally from the cell wall, a process known as plasmolysis. This directly rules out the possibilities of swelling and lysis due to water influx (hypotonic response), uniform crenation of the entire cell including the wall (the wall is rigid and does not shrivel), increased turgor pressure (that requires net water influx), or chemical dissolution of chitin by salt (high sodium chloride does not chemically dissolve chitin under these conditions).\n\nTherefore, the immediate physical consequence is that water exits the cell, the cytoplasm shrinks, and the plasma membrane pulls away from the stationary cell wall, i.e., plasmolysis.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2097981"}, {"introduction": "While water moves relatively freely across membranes, the transport of most other molecules, like amino acids and sugars, depends on specialized integral membrane proteins. These transporters can be classified based on their energy requirements and whether they move one or more solutes.

The transport of alanine does not require the direct hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n2. The movement of alanine is not coupled to the concurrent transport of any other substance, such as protons (H+) or sodium ions (Na+).\n\nBased on this information, which of the following best describes this transport system?\n\nA.

Options excluded:\n- A (simple diffusion): would not require a specific transporter and is unlikely for a polar amino acid.\n- B (primary active transport): requires ATP hydrolysis, not observed.\n- C and F (secondary active transport): require coupling to another solute, not observed.\n- E (endocytosis): bulk uptake mechanism, not a specific solute transporter.\n\nTherefore, the best description is facilitated diffusion via a uniporter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2097938"}, {"introduction": "Many essential transport processes must move solutes *against* their concentration gradient, a task that requires energy.
