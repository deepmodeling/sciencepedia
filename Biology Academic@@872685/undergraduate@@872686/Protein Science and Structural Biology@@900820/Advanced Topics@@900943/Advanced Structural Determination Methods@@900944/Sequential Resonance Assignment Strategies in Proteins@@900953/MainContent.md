## Introduction
Determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a cornerstone of modern [structural biology](@entry_id:151045), and it all begins with a critical, foundational step: **[sequential resonance assignment](@entry_id:192875)**. This process involves meticulously linking every signal in a complex NMR spectrum to a specific nucleus within the protein's [amino acid sequence](@entry_id:163755). Without this atomic-level map, the wealth of structural and dynamic information encoded in the NMR data remains inaccessible. This article addresses the central challenge of protein NMR: how to transform a crowded, seemingly indecipherable spectrum into an ordered list of assignments that paves the way for structure calculation and [functional analysis](@entry_id:146220).

## Principles and Mechanisms

The determination of a protein's three-dimensional structure by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a multi-stage process, predicated on the foundational step of **resonance assignment**. This procedure involves the unambiguous correlation of every NMR signal, or resonance, to a specific nucleus within the protein's primary amino acid sequence. Once assignments are complete, structural restraints can be measured and used to calculate the protein's architecture. This chapter elucidates the core principles and experimental mechanisms that underpin the modern strategy for assigning protein backbone resonances.

### The Challenge of Resonance Assignment: From Crowded Spectra to Ordered Information

For a protein uniformly enriched with the [stable isotopes](@entry_id:164542) ${}^{15}\text{N}$ and ${}^{13}\text{C}$, the starting point for backbone assignment is typically the two-dimensional ${}^{1}\text{H}$-${}^{15}\text{N}$ Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectrum. This experiment generates a single cross-peak for the backbone [amide](@entry_id:184165) group ($N-H$) of each amino acid residue, with the exception of [proline](@entry_id:166601). Because the [chemical shift](@entry_id:140028) environment of each amide group is exquisitely sensitive to its local conformation and sequence context, the resulting spectrum of peaks is unique for a given protein under specific conditions. For this reason, the ${}^{1}\text{H}$-${}^{15}\text{N}$ HSQC is often referred to as the protein's "fingerprint" [@problem_id:2136834]. While this fingerprint provides a powerful tool for monitoring protein folding, stability, and [ligand binding](@entry_id:147077), it does not, in itself, reveal the identity or sequential location of the residues corresponding to each peak. The central task of sequential assignment is to order these anonymous peaks according to the known primary sequence.

For small proteins (typically under 100 residues), assignment strategies can sometimes rely on experiments performed on unlabeled samples in ${}^{1}\text{H}_2\text{O}$ solution. However, as protein size increases, this approach rapidly becomes untenable. The fundamental limitation lies in the intrinsically narrow **[chemical shift](@entry_id:140028) dispersion** of protons (${}^{1}\text{H}$). The majority of protein proton resonances fall within a small range of the spectrum (approximately 0 to 10 ppm). As the number of amino acids increases, the number of proton signals grows proportionally, leading to severe spectral crowding and signal overlap. In a 2D ${}^{1}\text{H}$-${}^{1}\text{H}$ spectrum, where thousands of cross-peaks may be generated, this overlap renders the spectrum an indecipherable thicket of signals [@problem_id:2136838].

The solution to this problem is **isotopic labeling**—the uniform enrichment of the protein with NMR-active nuclei such as ${}^{15}\text{N}$ and ${}^{13}\text{C}$. These heteronuclei possess much larger [chemical shift](@entry_id:140028) dispersion ranges (e.g., ~35 ppm for ${}^{15}\text{N}$ and >180 ppm for ${}^{13}\text{C}$). Isotopic labeling enables **triple-resonance experiments**, which correlate the [amide](@entry_id:184165) proton and nitrogen with various carbon nuclei along the backbone. By spreading the signals across a third (or even fourth) dimension corresponding to a ${}^{13}\text{C}$ or ${}^{15}\text{N}$ [chemical shift](@entry_id:140028), the problem of overlap is dramatically mitigated, allowing for the resolution of individual signals even in large proteins.

### The Foundational Concepts: Spin Systems and Correlation Types

To understand sequential assignment, one must first grasp the concept of a **[spin system](@entry_id:755232)**. A [spin system](@entry_id:755232) is defined as a group of nuclear spins that are connected to one another through covalent bonds, allowing for interaction via **[scalar coupling](@entry_id:203370)**, or **J-coupling**. This is a **through-bond** phenomenon. Within a single amino acid residue, the network of covalent bonds connects the backbone and side-chain nuclei ($H^{N}$, $N$, $C\alpha$, $H\alpha$, $C\beta$, $H\beta$, etc.), forming a discrete spin system. Experiments like Total Correlation Spectroscopy (TOCSY) are designed to transfer magnetization throughout such a coupled network, allowing the identification of all protons belonging to a single amino acid residue [@problem_id:2136876].

It is critical to distinguish these through-bond correlations from **through-space** correlations, which are mediated by the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE). An NOE is observed between nuclei that are physically close in 3D space (typically $\lt 5$ Å), regardless of whether they are connected by [covalent bonds](@entry_id:137054). NOESY experiments, which detect these interactions, are the primary source of [distance restraints](@entry_id:200711) for 3D structure calculation. While short-range, inter-residue NOEs can aid in assignment, they are distinct from the through-bond J-coupling mechanism. For example, the alpha-proton of residue $i-1$ ($H\alpha_{i-1}$) and the amide proton of residue $i$ ($H^{N}_{i}$) are not connected by a continuous chain of J-coupled protons and thus cannot show a correlation in a TOCSY experiment. However, they are often spatially close and can show a cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum [@problem_id:2136819]. The classical sequential assignment strategy, however, relies exclusively on unambiguous through-bond connectivities.

### The Triple-Resonance Strategy: Walking Along the Backbone

The core of modern backbone assignment is the **sequential walk**: a systematic, residue-by-residue process of linking adjacent [spin systems](@entry_id:155077) along the polypeptide chain [@problem_id:2136825]. This is achieved using a suite of triple-resonance experiments that establish through-bond correlations between atoms of a given residue, denoted residue $i$, and the preceding residue, $i-1$.

These experiments are almost universally designed to initiate the magnetization transfer process from the backbone **[amide](@entry_id:184165) proton** ($H^{N}$). The reason for this choice is rooted in [spectral resolution](@entry_id:263022). The [amide](@entry_id:184165) proton resonances are typically found in a "downfield" region of the proton spectrum (approx. 7.0-10.0 ppm) that is relatively isolated from the densely packed aliphatic ($H\alpha, H\beta, etc.$) and aromatic proton regions. In contrast, the $H\alpha$ protons (approx. 3.5-5.5 ppm) reside in a region heavily overlapped with other side-chain protons. By starting with the spectrally resolved $H^{N}$ protons, magnetization can be cleanly and selectively transferred to the attached ${}^{15}\text{N}$ and then relayed to other nuclei in the backbone, minimizing artifacts and ambiguity [@problem_id:2136842].

### Key Experiments for the Sequential Walk

The sequential walk is accomplished by combining information from several key 3D triple-resonance experiments. Each experiment provides a specific piece of the connectivity puzzle. A common approach involves analyzing 2D "strips" taken from the 3D spectra, where each strip corresponds to a unique $H^{N}_{i}$ and $N_{i}$ [chemical shift](@entry_id:140028) pair from the HSQC spectrum.

#### Linking via the Alpha-Carbon (Cα)

The workhorse experiment for sequential assignment is the **HNCA**. This experiment establishes a correlation between the amide group of residue $i$ ($H^{N}_{i}, N_{i}$) and the alpha-carbons ($C\alpha$) of both its own residue ($i$) and the preceding residue ($i-1$). The magnetization transfer pathway relies on J-couplings within the residue (${}^{1}J_{NC\alpha}$) and across the peptide bond (${}^{2}J_{NC\alpha}$). Consequently, a strip taken from the HNCA spectrum at the coordinates of $H^{N}_{i}$ and $N_{i}$ will display two peaks in the ${}^{13}\text{C}$ dimension: one at the chemical shift of $C\alpha_{i}$ and another at the chemical shift of $C\alpha_{i-1}$ [@problem_id:2136817]. The intra-residue correlation ($C\alpha_{i}$) is typically stronger than the sequential one ($C\alpha_{i-1}$).

#### Adding Beta-Carbon (Cβ) Information for Robustness

While the HNCA provides the fundamental link, its utility is greatly enhanced by experiments that also correlate to the beta-carbon ($C\beta$). The chemical shifts of $C\alpha$ and $C\beta$ are highly characteristic of amino acid type, aiding in residue identification. Two complementary experiments are central here: the **HNCACB** and the **CBCA(CO)NH** [@problem_id:2136853].

*   The **HNCACB** experiment is analogous to the HNCA but transfers magnetization to both $C\alpha$ and $C\beta$ nuclei. A strip at ($H^{N}_{i}, N_{i}$) will show peaks for $C\alpha_{i}$, $C\beta_{i}$, $C\alpha_{i-1}$, and $C\beta_{i-1}$. Glycine residues, which lack a $C\beta$, will show no $C\beta$ peaks.
*   The **CBCA(CO)NH** experiment is designed to be selective. The magnetization transfer is filtered through the carbonyl carbon ($C'$) of the preceding residue. As a result, it exclusively correlates the amide group of residue $i$ with the carbons of residue $i-1$. A strip at ($H^{N}_{i}, N_{i}$) will show peaks for only $C\alpha_{i-1}$ and $C\beta_{i-1}$.

By comparing the HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra for the same strip, one can unambiguously distinguish the intra-residue ($i$) from the inter-residue ($i-1$) signals. The peaks present in both spectra belong to residue $i-1$, while those present only in the HNCACB belong to residue $i$. This pairing is exceptionally powerful for confirming sequential links.

#### Linking via the Carbonyl Carbon (C')

An independent and orthogonal connection is provided by the **HNCO** experiment. The name itself—H, N, CO—describes the correlation. This experiment establishes a through-bond connection between the amide group of residue $i$ ($H^{N}_{i}, N_{i}$) and the carbonyl carbon of the preceding residue, $C'_{i-1}$, via the one-bond J-coupling across the [peptide bond](@entry_id:144731) (${}^{1}J_{NC'}$) [@problem_id:2136873]. A peak in the 3D HNCO spectrum at coordinates ($H^{N}_{i}, N_{i}, C'_{i-1}$) provides a definitive link between the amide of one residue and the carbonyl of the previous one. This confirms the backbone connectivity established by the $C\alpha/C\beta$-based experiments.

### Assembling the Puzzle: The Backbone Walk in Practice

The process of sequential assignment involves using the data from this suite of experiments to trace the [polypeptide chain](@entry_id:144902). Let us consider a hypothetical assignment for the peptide Ala-Gly-Val-Ser-Leu, focusing on residues 2 through 5 [@problem_id:2136834].

1.  **Identify Spin Systems and an Anchor Point:** First, all the [spin systems](@entry_id:155077) are identified. One would then look for an anchor point. A good starting point is the residue immediately following the N-terminus. For the [spin system](@entry_id:755232) corresponding to Gly(2), we expect its own $C\alpha$ shift to match that of [glycine](@entry_id:176531) (approx. 45.1 ppm) and its preceding $C\alpha(i-1)$ shift to match that of alanine (approx. 52.5 ppm). By searching the HNCA or HNCACB data, we can find the unique spin system that satisfies these criteria.

2.  **Perform the First "Walk" Step:** Once Gly(2) is assigned, we know its $C\alpha$ chemical shift. The next residue in the sequence is Val(3). We now search for an unassigned [spin system](@entry_id:755232) where the $C\alpha(i-1)$ [chemical shift](@entry_id:140028) matches the known $C\alpha$ shift of Gly(2). The $C\alpha(i)$ shift of this new [spin system](@entry_id:755232) should also be consistent with that of a valine (approx. 62.0 ppm). This match identifies the [spin system](@entry_id:755232) for Val(3).

3.  **Continue the Walk:** The process is repeated iteratively. To find Ser(4), we search for a [spin system](@entry_id:755232) whose $C\alpha(i-1)$ shift matches the now-assigned $C\alpha$ of Val(3). To find Leu(5), we search for a [spin system](@entry_id:755232) whose $C\alpha(i-1)$ shift matches the $C\alpha$ of Ser(4).

By chaining these connections together—matching the $C\alpha_{i}$ of one spin system to the $C\alpha_{i-1}$ of the next—one can "walk" along the protein backbone, sequentially assigning each residue's NMR frequencies to its position in the primary sequence. The HNCACB/CBCA(CO)NH and HNCO data are used throughout this process to confirm links and help identify residue types.

### Challenges and Complications in Sequential Assignment

While powerful, this strategy is not without its challenges. Certain features of a [protein sequence](@entry_id:184994) or structure can interrupt or complicate the assignment process.

#### The Proline Problem

The sequential walk is definitively broken at every **[proline](@entry_id:166601)** residue. Proline is unique among the 20 common amino acids in that it is a secondary amine. Its side chain forms a cyclic structure by bonding back to its own backbone nitrogen atom. As a result, a proline residue **lacks the backbone [amide](@entry_id:184165) proton ($H^{N}$)** that is essential for initiating the magnetization transfer in the entire suite of HN-detected triple-resonance experiments (HNCA, HNCO, HNCACB, etc.) [@problem_id:2136841]. No signal will appear for the [proline](@entry_id:166601) residue itself in a ${}^{1}\text{H}$-${}^{15}\text{N}$ HSQC. Furthermore, for the residue immediately following proline (residue $i$), the crucial sequential correlations to the [proline](@entry_id:166601) at position $i-1$ (e.g., $C\alpha_{i-1}, C\beta_{i-1}, C'_{i-1}$) will be observable. However, since proline has no $H^N$, there is no starting point to link *from* [proline](@entry_id:166601) *to* the next residue. This creates a mandatory break in the chain, forcing the researcher to restart the assignment process from a new anchor point on the other side of the proline.

#### Signal Disappearance due to Dynamics

Another common issue is the disappearance of expected peaks, particularly for residues in flexible regions of the protein. For residues in a highly flexible, solvent-exposed loop, the backbone amide protons are susceptible to **[chemical exchange](@entry_id:155955)** with protons from the bulk solvent (water). When this exchange occurs on a timescale that is "intermediate" relative to the NMR measurement (i.e., comparable to the frequency difference between the amide and water proton signals), it leads to a phenomenon called **[exchange broadening](@entry_id:749152)**. This process dramatically increases the transverse relaxation rate ($R_2$) of the nucleus, causing its resonance line to become extremely broad. A very broad peak has very low height, and if it becomes broad enough, its intensity will fall below the noise level of the spectrum, rendering it undetectable [@problem_id:2136814]. Therefore, it is common for the HSQC peaks of residues in dynamic loops or at the unstructured termini of a protein to be weak or entirely missing, creating gaps in the assignment map that must be bridged by other means.

In summary, the sequential assignment of protein backbone resonances is a systematic process of deduction, built upon a foundation of isotopic labeling and a sophisticated suite of multi-dimensional NMR experiments. By understanding the principles of through-bond magnetization transfer and the specific connectivities provided by each experiment, researchers can transform a complex spectrum into a precise, atom-level map of the polypeptide chain, paving the way for detailed structural and dynamic analysis.
