The Global Distance Test Total Score, or GDT_TS, is a primary metric used in CASP to quantify how closely a model resembles the true experimental structure. This exercise will help you build a strong intuition for what these scores represent visually, translating a numerical value into a clear mental image of a model's accuracy. [@problem_id:2102986]", "problem": "In the field of protein science, the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) is a community-wide experiment to determine the state of the art in protein structure modeling. A key metric used to evaluate the quality of a predicted model against an experimentally determined native structure is the Global Distance Test Total Score (GDT_TS). This score calculates the percentage of C-alpha atoms in the model that are found within a series of distance cutoffs (specifically, 1 Å, 2 Å, 4 Å, and 8 Å) relative to the same atoms in the native structure after optimal superposition. A higher GDT_TS indicates a better model.\n\nAn undergraduate researcher has generated two computational models, Model X and Model Y, for a single-domain target protein of 150 amino acids. After the native structure was released, she superimposed her models and calculated their GDT_TS scores. Model X achieved a GDT_TS of 95, while Model Y scored a GDT_TS of 25.\n\nBased on the principles behind the GDT_TS metric, which of the following statements provides the most accurate visual and structural description of what the researcher would observe upon superimposing each model onto the native structure?\n\nA. Model Y would likely have a completely incorrect overall fold, with perhaps only a single small secondary structure element or a short contiguous segment (around 35-40 residues) aligning reasonably well with the native structure. In contrast, Model X would appear nearly identical to the native structure, with the vast majority of its backbone trace superimposing almost perfectly.\n\nB. Both models would display the correct overall fold. However, the C-alpha atoms in Model Y would be systematically shifted, resulting in a large root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) across the entire structure, whereas the atoms in Model X would be very close to their native positions.\n\nC. Model X correctly predicts all alpha-helices and beta-sheets, but their relative packing and overall tertiary arrangement are incorrect. Model Y fails to predict even the correct secondary structure elements, showing a random-coil-like conformation.\n\nD. A GDT_TS of 25 indicates that 25% of the model is structurally dissimilar, meaning 75% of Model Y is correctly folded. A GDT_TS of 95 means only 5% of Model X is dissimilar. Visually, both models would look very similar to the native structure, with Model Y just having a slightly larger disordered region.\n\nE. The GDT_TS score is primarily sensitive to the protein's core packing. Model X has a correctly packed hydrophobic core, but its surface loops are completely different from the native structure. Model Y has a poorly packed core, causing it to be evaluated as a low-quality model.", "solution": "The Global Distance Test Total Score (GDT_TS) is defined as the average over four distance cutoffs after optimal superposition of model and native structures. Let $N$ be the number of residues and let $P_{d}$ denote the fraction (between $0$ and $1$) of C-alpha atoms within distance cutoff $d$ after optimal superposition. Then\n$$\n\\mathrm{GDT\\_TS}=\\frac{P_{1}+P_{2}+P_{4}+P_{8}}{4}\\times 100,\n$$\nso that the mean fraction of residues close to native across the four thresholds is\n$$\nf=\\frac{P_{1}+P_{2}+P_{4}+P_{8}}{4}=\\frac{\\mathrm{GDT\\_TS}}{100}.\n$$\nFor $N=150$ residues, the average number of residues judged close to native across the thresholds is $Nf$.\n\nFor Model X, $\\mathrm{GDT\\_TS}=95$ implies $f_{X}=0.95$, so $N f_{X}=150\\times 0.95=142.5$. Interpreting this as an average over thresholds, this means that almost all residues lie very near their native positions under optimal superposition, which visually corresponds to a backbone trace that superimposes almost perfectly with the native structure, with at most small deviations in a few loops.\n\nFor Model Y, $\\mathrm{GDT\\_TS}=25$ implies $f_{Y}=0.25$, so $N f_{Y}=150\\times 0.25=37.5$. Interpreting this similarly, only about one quarter of residues on average fall within the distance cutoffs, consistent with one short contiguous segment (on the order of tens of residues, roughly $35$ to $40$) aligning reasonably while the remainder deviates substantially, i.e., an overall incorrect fold.\n\nBecause GDT_TS is computed after optimal superposition, a model with the correct overall fold but merely subjected to a uniform rigid-body shift would not score as low as $25$; the superposition removes such shifts and would place many residues within the distance cutoffs if the fold were correct. Thus the notion that both models have the correct fold but differ by a uniform shift is inconsistent with a GDT_TS of $25$. Likewise, a GDT_TS of $95$ is incompatible with a model that has incorrect tertiary packing despite correct secondary structure assignment, and GDT_TS does not primarily isolate core packing independent of loops; large loop discrepancies would lower the score significantly. Finally, interpreting a GDT_TS of $25$ as meaning that $75$ percent of the structure is correct is a misunderstanding, since GDT_TS is an average over multiple cutoffs and does not represent a simple complement.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that Model Y likely has an incorrect overall fold with at most a small segment aligning, while Model X appears nearly identical to the native structure upon superposition, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2102986"}, {"introduction": "While an absolute score like GDT_TS tells us about a model's intrinsic quality, the CASP experiment is also a competition.

[@problem_id:2102971]", "problem": "In the field of protein structure prediction, two computational models, Model A and Model B, have been generated for a novel 250-amino-acid enzyme. The enzyme is known to consist of a large, globular catalytic domain (residues 81-250) and a long, flexible N-terminal tail (residues 1-80) that is predicted to be intrinsically disordered. An experimentally determined crystal structure of the full-length enzyme is available and serves as the ground truth for evaluation.\n\nThe quality of the models is initially assessed by calculating the global Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), a metric that measures the average distance between the backbone C-alpha atoms of the modeled structure and the experimental reference structure after optimal superposition. The calculations yield a global RMSD of 2.1 Å for Model A and 6.5 Å for Model B.\n\nDespite Model B having a significantly higher global RMSD, a researcher argues that it might still be a more useful and accurate representation of the enzyme's functional core than Model A.

Model B has more accurate side-chain conformations in the enzyme's active site, even if its overall C-alpha backbone trace is less accurate than Model A's.\nB. The high global RMSD of Model B is an artifact of the Ramachandran plot, indicating that while the backbone has unusual torsion angles, its 3D structure is still correct.\nC.

Model B could have a very low RMSD for the catalytic domain (residues 81-250) when calculated locally, with the high global RMSD being caused almost entirely by the large, arbitrary displacement of the flexible N-terminal tail.\nE. The RMSD calculation for Model B accidentally included water molecules from the crystal structure, artificially inflating its value compared to Model A.", "solution": "We start from the definition of the backbone C-alpha global RMSD after optimal superposition. For a model with $N$ aligned C-alpha atoms and distances $d_{i}$ between corresponding atoms in the model and the reference, the RMSD is\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSD}_{\\mathrm{global}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{i}^{2}}.\n$$\nIn this problem, $N=250$. The enzyme consists of a flexible, intrinsically disordered N-terminal tail (residues $1$ to $80$) and a structured catalytic domain (residues $81$ to $250$). It is standard in structural biology that intrinsically disordered regions can adopt many conformations and often do not align well with a single crystallographic conformation, even when the folded domain is modeled accurately.\n\nWe can decompose the RMSD sum into tail and domain contributions:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSD}_{\\mathrm{global}}^{2}=\\frac{1}{250}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{80} d_{i}^{2}+\\sum_{i=81}^{250} d_{i}^{2}\\right).\n$$\nIf the catalytic domain is modeled accurately, then $d_{i}$ for $i=81,\\dots,250$ are small, so the domain-local RMSD\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSD}_{\\mathrm{domain}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{170}\\sum_{i=81}^{250} d_{i}^{2}}\n$$\ncan be low.

Therefore, a high global RMSD can be driven almost entirely by a flexible region that is not functionally critical, while the functional core (the catalytic domain) is modeled well.\n\nNow evaluate the statements:\n\nA. Accuracy of side-chain conformations in the active site can be functionally important, but the RMSD reported is computed on C-alpha atoms and does not directly assess side-chain placement. While plausible, this does not explain the specific discrepancy of high global RMSD due to flexible regions, nor does it leverage the known domain organization.\n\nB. The Ramachandran plot is a torsion-angle quality assessment; it does not cause artifacts in RMSD. High RMSD is not an artifact of the Ramachandran analysis.\n\nC. There is no general monotonic relationship by which higher RMSD corresponds to lower, more favorable potential energy; this is incorrect.\n\nD. This directly captures the core structural principle: the global RMSD can be dominated by a flexible, intrinsically disordered tail, while a local RMSD computed on the catalytic domain can be low. This is consistent with the known architecture and is the most scientifically sound justification.\n\nE. RMSD here is defined on backbone C-alpha atoms; water molecules are not included in such RMSD calculations, so this cannot explain the discrepancy.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound justification is that Model B’s high global RMSD could be caused primarily by the flexible N-terminal tail, while the catalytic domain has a low local RMSD, corresponding to statement D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2102971"}]}
