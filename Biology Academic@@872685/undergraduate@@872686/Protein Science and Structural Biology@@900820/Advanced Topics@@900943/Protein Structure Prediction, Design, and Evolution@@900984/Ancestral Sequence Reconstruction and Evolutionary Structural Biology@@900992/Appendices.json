Not all positions in an alignment are equally useful; some provide clear evidence for the ancestral state, while others are ambiguous due to variation or gaps. This first exercise challenges you to critically evaluate a hypothetical MSA and distinguish between informative and uninformative sites, a crucial first step in any ASR project [@problem_id:2099393].", "problem": "An evolutionary biochemist is studying a family of hypothetical enzymes isolated from three related species: Species A, Species B, and Species C.

The internal node on the phylogenetic tree representing the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) of Species A and Species B is designated `Anc-AB`. The goal is to reconstruct the most likely ancestral sequence at this `Anc-AB` node.\n\nDifferent positions (columns) in the alignment provide varying degrees of information for this reconstruction. Some columns allow for a highly confident inference of the ancestral amino acid, while others are highly ambiguous. Identify a pair of column indices `(i, j)` where column `i` is highly informative for inferring the amino acid at `Anc-AB`, and column `j` is highly ambiguous for the same inference.\n\nA.

Although parsimony favors a single event (either an insertion on the C lineage or a deletion on the AB lineage), this yields a gap at $\\text{Anc-AB}$, which does not identify an amino acid.

One of the simplest and most fundamental methods for this task is the principle of maximum parsimony. This principle states that the preferred evolutionary history is the one that requires the smallest number of evolutionary changes (e.g., amino acid substitutions) to explain the sequences observed in modern-day organisms.\n\nConsider a set of four homologous proteins: P1, P2, P3, and P4. Their evolutionary relationship is described by the phylogenetic tree `((P1, P2)Anc1, (P3, P4)Anc2)Anc-Root`. This notation means that P1 and P2 share a recent common ancestor, Anc1. Similarly, P3 and P4 share a recent common ancestor, Anc2. Both Anc1 and Anc2, in turn, descend from a last common ancestor for all four proteins, Anc-Root.\n\nWe are examining a single position in the alignment of these four protein sequences. For any given ancestor in the tree, a reconstruction of the amino acid at this position is considered \"unambiguous\" if a single amino acid state minimizes the total number of substitutions to its descendants.
