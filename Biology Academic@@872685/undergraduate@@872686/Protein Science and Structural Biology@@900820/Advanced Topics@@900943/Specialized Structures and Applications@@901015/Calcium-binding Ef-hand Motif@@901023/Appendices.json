This final exercise shifts focus from calculation to conceptual understanding, asking you to predict the functional consequence of a specific mutation within the EF-hand binding loop. This type of structure-function reasoning is at the heart of protein engineering and the study of how genetic variations can lead to disease [@problem_id:2102372].", "problem": "The EF-hand motif is a common calcium-binding structural domain found in many calcium-signaling proteins. It consists of a helix-loop-helix structure where the loop region is responsible for chelating a single calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$). The canonical 12-residue binding loop contains several conserved amino acids whose side chains provide oxygen atoms that act as ligands for the $Ca^{2+}$ ion. At physiological pH, one of the most critical residues is a glutamate (Glu) at position 12 of the loop, which provides a negatively charged carboxylate group that strongly interacts with the divalent cation.\n\nA researcher performs a site-directed mutagenesis experiment on a protein containing a single EF-hand motif. The gene is altered to replace the conserved glutamate residue at position 12 of the binding loop with a glutamine (Gln) residue. Based on the chemical properties of these amino acid side chains, what is the most likely effect of this mutation on the protein's ability to bind $Ca^{2+}$?\n\nA. The affinity for $Ca^{2+}$ will significantly increase because the amide group of glutamine is a better metal ion ligand than a carboxylate group.\n\nB. There will be no significant change in affinity for $Ca^{2+}$ because the side chains of glutamate and glutamine have the same length and similar volume.\n\nC. The affinity for $Ca^{2+}$ will significantly decrease because a neutral polar side chain replaces a negatively charged side chain.\n\nD. The affinity for $Ca^{2+}$ will significantly decrease primarily due to steric hindrance, as the glutamine side chain is much larger and disrupts the loop's conformation.", "solution": "We identify the EF-hand loop as a calcium-binding site that uses multiple oxygen ligands to coordinate one $Ca^{2+}$, commonly forming a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. A strictly conserved feature is the residue at position 12, which is typically glutamate (Glu). In many EF-hand motifs, the Glu carboxylate at position 12 provides bidentate coordination (two oxygen atoms) to $Ca^{2+}$, enhancing binding via both electrostatic attraction and the chelate effect.\n\nAt physiological pH, the side-chain carboxyl group of Glu has $pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}<\\text{physiological pH}$, so it is deprotonated and carries a negative charge. In contrast, the side chain of glutamine (Gln) is an amide, which is not titratable in this range and remains neutral. Therefore, replacing Glu with Gln at position 12 changes the ligand from a negatively charged carboxylate (often bidentate) to a neutral polar amide (typically monodentate via the carbonyl oxygen).\n\nFrom coordination chemistry and electrostatics:\n- Electrostatic attraction between the ligand and $Ca^{2+}$ contributes favorably to binding. A simple qualitative Coulombic term is $U \\propto -\\frac{q_{\\text{ligand}} q_{\\text{metal}}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon r}$, where $q_{\\text{metal}}=+2$ for $Ca^{2+}$ and $q_{\\text{ligand}}$ is negative for Glu but approximately zero for Gln. Replacing Glu with Gln reduces this stabilizing interaction.\n- Hard-soft acid-base considerations indicate that $Ca^{2+}$ (a hard acid) prefers hard, anionic oxygen donors like carboxylates over neutral carbonyls; thus, the carboxylate of Glu is a stronger ligand than the amide of Gln.\n- Denticity matters: a bidentate carboxylate at position 12 can provide two coordinating oxygens, while an amide carbonyl can typically contribute only one, weakening the overall coordination network and chelate stabilization.\n\nThese changes reduce the stability constant $K$ for $Ca^{2+}$ binding and thereby increase the dissociation constant, $K_{d}^{\\text{mut}} > K_{d}^{\\text{WT}}$, since $K_{d} = 1/K$. Consequently, the affinity, which is proportional to $1/K_{d}$, decreases upon the Glu-to-Gln mutation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because amide oxygens are weaker, neutral donors compared to anionic carboxylates; they do not increase affinity.\n- B is incorrect because charge and denticity, not merely side-chain length or volume, dominate the binding energetics.\n- C is correct: replacing a negatively charged carboxylate with a neutral amide reduces electrostatic attraction and coordination strength, significantly decreasing affinity.\n- D is incorrect as the primary effect is not steric; the sizes are similar, and the dominant factor is loss of anionic, bidentate coordination.\n\nTherefore, the most likely effect is a significant decrease in $Ca^{2+}$ affinity due to replacement of a negatively charged carboxylate with a neutral amide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2102372"}]}
