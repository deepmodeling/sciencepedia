This exercise challenges you to think like a biochemist troubleshooting a failed experiment.

The sequencing is performed using automated Edman degradation, which involves the sequential removal and identification of N-terminal amino acids. After the first complete cycle of the chemistry, analysis by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) reveals a baseline signal with no detectable peak corresponding to a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid derivative. Assuming the sequencing instrument is functioning perfectly and all chemical reagents are of high quality, which of the following characteristics of the peptide could independently account for this experimental outcome?\n\nSelect all valid options.\n\nA. The N-terminal amino acid of the peptide is proline.\n\nB. The peptide is cyclic, with its C-terminus covalently linked to its N-terminus.\n\nC. The peptide contains an internal isopeptide bond between the side chains of a lysine and an aspartate.\n\nD. The peptide has undergone post-translational modification, resulting in the formation of a pyroglutamate residue from an N-terminal glutamine.\n\nE. The C-terminal carboxyl group of the peptide is amidated.", "solution": "Edman degradation requires a free, unmodified N-terminal alpha-amino group. The chemistry proceeds by reaction of the N-terminal amino group with phenylisothiocyanate under mildly basic conditions to form a phenylthiocarbamyl derivative, followed by acid-mediated cyclization and cleavage to yield a phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid that is resolved by HPLC. Therefore, any condition that removes or blocks the free N-terminal alpha-amino group will prevent formation and detection of the PTH-amino acid after the first cycle; conversely, modifications not affecting the N-terminus should not abolish the first-cycle signal.\n\nEvaluate each option with this principle:\n\nA. An N-terminal proline presents a secondary alpha-amino group. Edman chemistry can proceed, albeit sometimes with reduced efficiency, and PTH-proline is detectable under standard automated conditions. With a properly functioning instrument and high-quality reagents, this does not independently account for complete absence of a first-cycle PTH peak. Thus A is not a sufficient explanation.\n\nB. A head-to-tail cyclic peptide has no free N-terminal alpha-amino group because the N-terminus is covalently linked to the C-terminus. Without a free N-terminus, phenylisothiocyanate cannot form the phenylthiocarbamyl derivative, so no PTH-amino acid is produced. This independently accounts for no detectable PTH peak. Thus B is valid.\n\nC. An internal isopeptide bond between a lysine side-chain amino group and an aspartate side-chain carboxyl group does not consume the N-terminal alpha-amino group. The free N-terminus remains available for Edman chemistry, so a first-cycle PTH peak should still be detected. Thus C is not a sufficient explanation.\n\nD. Conversion of an N-terminal glutamine to pyroglutamate cyclizes the N-terminus into a lactam, blocking the alpha-amino group. This prevents derivatization by phenylisothiocyanate and therefore prevents PTH-amino acid formation and detection. Thus D is valid.\n\nE. C-terminal amidation modifies the C-terminus and does not affect the N-terminal alpha-amino group. Edman degradation should proceed normally for the first cycle. Thus E is not a sufficient explanation.\n\nTherefore, the peptide characteristics that independently explain the absence of a first-cycle PTH peak are B and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2130443"}, {"introduction": "Ideal chemical reactions are a useful theoretical starting point, but real-world experiments often have side reactions that produce artifacts in the data.

In each cycle, after the primary cleavage reaction removes the N-terminal PITC-amino acid conjugate (a step which is itself 100% efficient), the acidic conditions inadvertently hydrolyze the very next peptide bond in the remaining peptide chain. This secondary hydrolysis occurs in 3.0% of the molecules that have just undergone the primary cleavage.

We are interested in the PTH derivatives released in this step.\n    - From Population A (PITC-Gly-Val-Leu): The PITC-Gly conjugate is cleaved. This yields **194.0 pmol of PTH-Gly**, which is the main signal for Cycle 2.
