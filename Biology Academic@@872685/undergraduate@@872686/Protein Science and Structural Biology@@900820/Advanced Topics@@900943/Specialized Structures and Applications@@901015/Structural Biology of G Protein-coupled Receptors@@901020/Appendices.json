In many GPCRs, the inactive state is stabilized by a critical intramolecular salt bridge known as the \"ionic lock.\" This exercise [@problem_id:2139656] challenges you to think like a protein engineer by proposing a single amino acid mutation to deliberately break this lock.

Their activation involves a conformational change from an inactive state to an active state. A key structural feature that stabilizes the inactive state in many class A GPCRs is the \"ionic lock,\" an intramolecular salt bridge.\n\nIn a hypothetical sensory GPCR, this ionic lock is formed between the positively charged side chain of an Arginine residue at position 135 (Arg-135), located at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 3, and the negatively charged side chain of a Glutamate residue at position 240 (Glu-240), located on transmembrane helix 6. This electrostatic interaction holds the helices in a conformation that prevents G protein binding.\n\nA researcher aims to create a mutant version of this receptor that is \"constitutively active,\" meaning it signals continuously even in the absence of its natural ligand.

Tyrosine at position 136 to Phenylalanine (Y136F)", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the single amino acid substitution most likely to disrupt the 'ionic lock' in a G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR), leading to constitutive activity.\n\nFirst, let's understand the principle of the ionic lock. The problem states it's a salt bridge, which is a strong non-covalent, electrostatic interaction between a positively charged amino acid side chain and a negatively charged one. In this specific GPCR, the lock is formed between Arginine-135 (Arg-135) and Glutamate-240 (Glu-240).\n\n- Arginine (Arg) has a guanidinium group in its side chain, which is positively charged at physiological pH.\n- Glutamate (Glu) has a carboxyl group in its side chain, which is negatively charged at physiological pH.\n\nThe attraction between the positive charge of Arg-135 and the negative charge of Glu-240 holds the receptor in its inactive conformation. To create a constitutively active receptor by disrupting this lock, we must eliminate this electrostatic attraction. This can be achieved by removing one of the charges, or by replacing one charge with a charge of the same sign (creating repulsion).\n\nNow, let's analyze each proposed mutation:\n\nA. **Arg-135 to Lysine (R135K)**: This mutation replaces Arginine with Lysine. Lysine (Lys) is also a basic amino acid with a positively charged side chain at physiological pH. While the length and geometry of the Lysine side chain are different from Arginine's, it is still capable of forming a favorable electrostatic interaction (a salt bridge) with the negatively charged Glutamate at position 240. This is a \"conservative\" substitution in terms of charge, and it is the least likely to completely abolish the ionic lock.\n\nB. **Glu-240 to Aspartate (E240D)**: This mutation replaces Glutamate with Aspartate. Aspartate (Asp) is also an acidic amino acid with a negatively charged side chain at physiological pH. The side chain of Aspartate is one methylene group shorter than that of Glutamate, but it still provides the necessary negative charge to maintain the salt bridge with Arg-135. This is also a very conservative substitution and is unlikely to disrupt the ionic lock.\n\nC. **Serine at position 10 to Alanine (S10A)**: Serine-10 is located in the N-terminal region of the protein, far from the transmembrane core where the ionic lock (between helix 3 and helix 6) is located. A mutation in this distal region would not be expected to have a direct effect on the interaction between Arg-135 and Glu-240. Therefore, it is highly unlikely to disrupt the ionic lock.\n\nD. **Arg-135 to Alanine (R135A)**: This mutation replaces the positively charged Arginine with Alanine. Alanine (Ala) has a small, non-polar (hydrophobic) methyl group as its side chain. It is uncharged. By substituting Arginine with Alanine, the positive charge essential for the salt bridge is completely removed. Without the positive charge at position 135, the electrostatic attraction to Glu-240 is eliminated. This will break the ionic lock, destabilize the inactive state, and shift the conformational equilibrium toward the active state, leading to constitutive activity. This is a highly disruptive mutation for the specified interaction.\n\nE. **Tyrosine at position 136 to Phenylalanine (Y136F)**: This mutation affects the residue immediately adjacent to Arg-135. Both Tyrosine (Tyr) and Phenylalanine (Phe) are large, aromatic amino acids. The substitution removes a hydroxyl group but retains the aromatic ring. Crucially, this mutation does not affect either of the charged residues (Arg-135 and Glu-240) that directly form the ionic lock. Therefore, it is not the most direct or effective way to break the salt bridge.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mutation that most directly and completely eliminates the electrostatic interaction of the ionic lock is the substitution of the charged Arginine-135 with a neutral Alanine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2139656"}, {"introduction": "The principles of GPCR structural biology are instrumental in modern pharmacology for the rational design of novel therapeutics.

A non-covalent antagonist, named 'Liganol', binds reversibly to SRT8. Structural studies of the Liganol-SRT8 complex have revealed the coordinates of key atomic positions within the binding pocket. Liganol contains a central phenyl ring, and its C4 carbon atom has been identified as a suitable attachment point for chemical modification without disrupting the primary binding interactions. This C4 atom is located at the origin of our coordinate system, (0, 0, 0).\n\nThe goal is to convert Liganol into a targeted covalent inhibitor by adding a reactive chemical moiety that will form an irreversible bond with a nearby cysteine residue. The SRT8 receptor contains two cysteine residues in or near the binding site region:\n\n1.  Cys150, located on the relatively flexible and non-conserved second extracellular loop (ECL2). The sulfur atom ($S_\\gamma$) of its side chain is located at coordinates (4.0, 2.0, 1.0) Angstroms.\n2.

You also need to calculate the straight-line distance, in Angstroms, from the C4 atom of Liganol to the target sulfur atom ($S_\\gamma$), which represents the required spatial reach for the new chemical linker.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following options correctly identifies the target cysteine, the appropriate reactive group, and the calculated distance?\n\nA.

A core principle in designing targeted covalent inhibitors is to select a non-essential residue to avoid disrupting the receptor's fundamental structure and function. The problem provides two options: Cys150 and Cys300. Cys300 is described as part of the \"highly conserved NPxxY motif, which is known to be absolutely critical for G-protein coupling and signal transduction.\" Targeting this residue would likely abrogate the receptor's essential function, making it an unsuitable choice for developing a specific inhibitor. In contrast, Cys150 is located on a \"relatively flexible and non-conserved\" extracellular loop. This description implies that it is not critical for the overall fold or function of the receptor, making it an ideal candidate for targeted modification. Therefore, we select Cys150 as the target. This eliminates options B and E.\n\nSecond, we must select the appropriate reactive group. The problem specifies that the bond should be formed via a Michael addition reaction with the cysteine's thiol group ($-SH$). The thiol group is a soft nucleophile. A Michael addition involves the nucleophilic attack on an $\\alpha$,$\\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n- An acrylamide group contains a carbon-carbon double bond conjugated to a carbonyl group, making it an excellent Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic sulfur of the cysteine can attack the $\\beta$-carbon of the acrylamide to form a stable, irreversible thioether bond.\n- An aldehyde group is primarily reactive toward nucleophilic amines (e.g., from lysine residues) to form a Schiff base. Its reaction with a thiol forms a hemithioacetal, which is typically reversible and not the intended stable covalent bond formation mechanism described.\nThus, the acrylamide group is the correct choice for the specified reaction type. This eliminates option C.\n\nThird, we calculate the straight-line distance between the ligand's attachment point and the target atom. The attachment point on Liganol is the C4 atom at $P_1 = (0, 0, 0)$ Angstroms. The target atom is the sulfur ($S_\\gamma$) of Cys150 at $P_2 = (4.0, 2.0, 1.0)$ Angstroms. We use the Euclidean distance formula in three dimensions:\n$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^{2} + (y_2 - y_1)^{2} + (z_2 - z_1)^{2}}$\n\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n$d = \\sqrt{(4.0 - 0)^{2} + (2.0 - 0)^{2} + (1.0 - 0)^{2}}$\n$d = \\sqrt{4.0^{2} + 2.0^{2} + 1.0^{2}}$\n$d = \\sqrt{16.0 + 4.0 + 1.0}$\n$d = \\sqrt{21.0}$\n$d \\approx 4.5825...$ Angstroms.\n\nThe calculated distance, rounded to two decimal places, is 4.58 Angstroms. This matches the distance given in option A. Option D lists the squared distance (21.00), which is a common calculation error.\n\nCombining all three steps, the correct choice is: Target: Cys150; Group: Acrylamide; Distance: 4.58 Angstroms.
