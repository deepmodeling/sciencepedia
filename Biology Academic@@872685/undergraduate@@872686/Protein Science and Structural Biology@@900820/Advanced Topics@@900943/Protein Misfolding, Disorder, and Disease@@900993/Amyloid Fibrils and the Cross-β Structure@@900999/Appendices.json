{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the assembly of amyloid fibrils begins with the fundamental chemical forces governed by amino acid side chains. The stability of the cross-β structure relies on a delicate balance between favorable interactions, like the burial of hydrophobic groups, and unfavorable ones, like electrostatic repulsion. This exercise challenges you to predict the consequences of a single, strategic mutation, requiring you to weigh the importance of the hydrophobic core against the destabilizing effect of introducing a charged residue. [@problem_id:2098242]", "problem": "Amyloid fibrils are insoluble protein aggregates characterized by a highly ordered cross-β structure, where β-sheets are stacked perpendicular to the long axis of the fibril. The formation of these fibrils is associated with numerous human diseases. A key driving force for fibril assembly is the hydrophobic effect, which promotes the packing of nonpolar amino acid side chains into a stable core, shielded from water.\n\nConsider a hypothetical heptapeptide with the sequence $\\text{NH}_2\\text{-Val-Ala-Ile-Phe-Met-Ala-Cys-COOH}$. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) and with mild agitation, this peptide is known to readily form stable amyloid fibrils. A researcher decides to investigate the role of the central hydrophobic core by creating a mutant version of this peptide. In the mutant peptide, the Phenylalanine (Phe) at position 4 is replaced by an Arginine (Arg).\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of protein structure and stability, what is the most likely effect of this Phe-to-Arg mutation on the peptide's propensity to form amyloid fibrils under the same physiological conditions?\n\nA. The propensity to form amyloid fibrils will be significantly reduced.\n\nB. The propensity to form amyloid fibrils will be significantly increased.\n\nC. The mutation will have no discernible effect on the rate or extent of fibril formation.\n\nD. The peptide will form fibrils that are more stable and more resistant to chemical denaturation than the original fibrils.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of mutating a central hydrophobic residue (Phenylalanine) to a bulky, positively charged residue (Arginine) within an amyloid-forming peptide. To solve this, we must analyze the key interactions that stabilize the amyloid fibril structure and how the mutation alters them.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure and stability of the original (wild-type) fibril.**\nThe original peptide has the sequence $\\text{NH}_2\\text{-Val-Ala-Ile-Phe-Met-Ala-Cys-COOH}$. The core of this sequence, particularly residues like Valine (Val), Isoleucine (Ile), Phenylalanine (Phe), and Methionine (Met), consists of amino acids with nonpolar, hydrophobic side chains. Amyloid fibrils are stabilized by the formation of a cross-β structure. In this arrangement, individual peptide molecules form β-strands, which then align to form extended β-sheets. These sheets stack on top of one another to form the fibril. A major thermodynamic driving force for this process is the hydrophobic effect. The nonpolar side chains from the different peptide layers pack tightly together in the core of the fibril, expelling water molecules. This burial of hydrophobic surfaces from the aqueous solvent is energetically favorable and provides a significant portion of the fibril's stability. The Phenylalanine residue, with its large, aromatic side chain, is a major contributor to this hydrophobic core.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of the mutation.**\nThe mutation replaces Phenylalanine (Phe) with Arginine (Arg) at position 4. Let's compare the side chains of these two amino acids.\n- **Phenylalanine (Phe):** Has a benzyl side chain (-CH₂-C₆H₅). It is large, aromatic, and strongly hydrophobic.\n- **Arginine (Arg):** Has a long side chain ending in a guanidinium group (-(CH₂)₃-NH-C(=NH₂⁺)-NH₂). At physiological pH (7.4), this group is protonated and carries a permanent positive charge. The side chain is large, bulky, and hydrophilic.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the consequences of the Phe-to-Arg mutation on fibril stability.**\nThe substitution of a core hydrophobic residue with a charged, hydrophilic one has two primary destabilizing consequences for the cross-β structure:\n\n1.  **Disruption of the Hydrophobic Core:** The formation of a stable amyloid fibril relies on the favorable packing of nonpolar side chains. Introducing a hydrophilic, charged Arginine side chain into this nonpolar environment is energetically highly unfavorable. It is analogous to trying to force a charged group into an oily, nonpolar solvent. This disrupts the tight, efficient packing of the hydrophobic core that stabilizes the fibril.\n\n2.  **Introduction of Electrostatic Repulsion:** As the mutant peptides attempt to stack into the fibril's layered β-sheet structure, the positively charged Arginine side chains from adjacent layers will be brought into close proximity. This will result in strong electrostatic repulsion (Coulombic repulsion) between the like charges. This repulsive force actively works against the association of peptide chains, destabilizing the ordered, compact fibril structure.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the overall effect and evaluate the given options.**\nThe combination of disrupting the essential hydrophobic core and introducing strong electrostatic repulsion makes the formation of the ordered fibril structure energetically unfavorable. Therefore, the mutant peptide will have a much lower tendency, or propensity, to assemble into amyloid fibrils compared to the original peptide.\n\nLet's review the options:\n- **A. The propensity to form amyloid fibrils will be significantly reduced.** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The mutation introduces destabilizing forces that oppose fibril formation. This is the correct answer.\n- **B. The propensity to form amyloid fibrils will be significantly increased.** This is incorrect. The mutation is destabilizing, not stabilizing.\n- **C. The mutation will have no discernible effect on the rate or extent of fibril formation.** This is incorrect. The chemical properties of the side chains are fundamentally different, and this will have a profound impact on the intermolecular interactions required for assembly.\n- **D. The peptide will form fibrils that are more stable and more resistant to chemical denaturation than the original fibrils.** This is incorrect. The new interactions are unfavorable, leading to a much less stable structure, if one forms at all. The fibril would be less resistant to denaturation, not more.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2098242"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational principles of amyloid stability, we can begin to make predictions about a protein's behavior based on its primary sequence.
