A standard diagnostic method involves treating brain homogenate samples with an enzyme, proteinase K, followed by a Western blot analysis to detect the protein. $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ is completely digested by proteinase K, whereas $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ is partially resistant, leaving a characteristic protease-resistant core.\n\nA researcher is analyzing brain tissue from two animals: one healthy control and one showing advanced symptoms of a prion disease. The researcher prepares the samples for Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequent Western blotting using an antibody that recognizes both $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ and $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$. However, the researcher inadvertently omits the crucial proteinase K treatment step for both samples.\n\nAssuming that both $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ and $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ have the same primary amino acid sequence and are glycosylated similarly, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome on the Western blot?\n\nA. The healthy sample will show a band, but the infected sample will show no band at all.\n\nB. The infected sample will show a band, but the healthy sample will show no band at all.\n\nC.

The healthy sample will show a single band, while the infected sample will show a distinct band at a significantly lower molecular weight.\n\nE. The infected sample will show a band at a significantly higher molecular weight than the healthy sample due to aggregation.", "solution": "Western blot detection after SDS-PAGE depends on two key features: (i) what species of the protein are present in the sample prior to electrophoresis, and (ii) whether the antibody recognizes those species. Proteinase K treatment is the diagnostic step that differentiates between $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ and $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$, because $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ is completely digested while $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ remains partially resistant, leaving a characteristic protease-resistant core of lower apparent molecular weight. \n\nIn the stated experiment, the researcher omits proteinase K for both samples. Therefore:\n1. Both $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ and $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ remain full-length in the samples. There is no proteolysis to generate a smaller, protease-resistant fragment in the infected sample.\n2. Under SDS-PAGE, SDS denatures proteins and approximately equalizes their charge-to-mass ratio, so migration depends primarily on polypeptide length and attached glycans. The problem specifies that both isoforms have the same primary amino acid sequence and are glycosylated similarly, implying the same apparent molecular weight and similar glycoform distribution on the gel.\n3. The antibody used recognizes both $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ and $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$, so any full-length form present will be detected. Because no protease treatment was performed, both the healthy and the infected samples will contain full-length prion protein that the antibody can detect.\n\nAddressing the options:\n- Option A and B are incorrect because, without proteinase K, both samples contain the antigen and the antibody recognizes both, so neither lane should be blank on that basis.\n- Option D is incorrect because a lower molecular weight band characteristic of the protease-resistant core appears only after proteinase K digestion, which was omitted.\n- Option E is not the most accurate description under standard SDS-PAGE and reducing conditions, which disrupt noncovalent aggregates; while $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ can aggregate in vivo, SDS-PAGE preparation typically minimizes aggregation-dependent shifts, and the primary expected signal is the full-length band at the same apparent molecular weight as the healthy sample given the stated assumptions.\n\nTherefore, both healthy and infected samples are expected to show a prominent band at approximately the same molecular weight.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2126299"}, {"introduction": "The 'protein-only' hypothesis, a cornerstone of prion biology, posits that the normal protein $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ is an essential substrate for prion replication. This exercise presents a sophisticated thought experiment, mirroring landmark studies that used genetically modified animals to prove this very point. By predicting the outcome in a chimeric mouse [@problem_id:2068133], you will directly engage with the logic that underpins our understanding of how prion diseases spread within an organism.", "problem": "Prion diseases, such as scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, are fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by the misfolding of a native cellular protein. The normal, functional protein is called the cellular Prion Protein ($\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$), which is encoded by the *PRNP* gene. The infectious, misfolded isoform is called the scrapie Prion Protein ($\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$). The central pathogenic mechanism involves $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ acting as a template to induce the conformational conversion of $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ into more $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$, leading to an exponential accumulation of the pathogenic form, subsequent aggregation, and neuronal cell death.\n\nConsider a sophisticated experiment designed to probe the mechanism of prion propagation. A line of genetically engineered mice has been created that completely lacks the *PRNP* gene; these mice are referred to as *PRNP*-null mice. Consequently, their cells do not produce any $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$. A small piece of brain tissue from a normal, wild-type mouse that expresses $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ is surgically implanted into the brain of an adult *PRNP*-null mouse. The graft successfully integrates with the host's tissue. Following a recovery period, the chimeric mouse is intracerebrally inoculated with a high titer of infectious $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$.\n\nBased on the established mechanism of prion replication, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed several months after inoculation?\n\nA. The entire brain of the *PRNP*-null mouse, including both the host tissue and the graft, will show widespread spongiform degeneration and $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ accumulation, and the mouse will develop clinical signs of scrapie.\n\nB. The *PRNP*-null mouse will remain completely asymptomatic, and the inoculated $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ will be effectively cleared from the brain by microglia without causing any pathology in either the graft or the host tissue.\n\nC. The grafted wild-type tissue will show significant $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ accumulation, astrocytosis, and spongiform degeneration, but the surrounding *PRNP*-null host brain tissue will remain entirely free of pathology.\n\nD. The inoculated $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ will replicate within the graft and then spread into the surrounding *PRNP*-null host tissue, eventually causing widespread pathology and disease, albeit at a much slower rate than in a wild-type mouse.\n\nE. The inoculated $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ will accumulate within the graft but will be unable to replicate, leading to a localized, non-progressive plaque without causing significant neuronal loss or clinical symptoms.", "solution": "The core physical principle of prion propagation is templated conformational conversion: the infectious isoform acts as a catalyst that converts the normal isoform into more of the infectious form. This can be represented schematically as a net conversion step,\n$$\n\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc} + \\text{PrP}^\\text{C} \\to 2\\,\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc},\n$$\nfollowed by aggregation of $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ and associated neurotoxicity. A necessary condition for replication is the presence of the substrate $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$. In cells that lack the *PRNP* gene, the cellular prion protein is absent, which can be summarized as an effective substrate concentration of $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}=0$. Under this condition, the conversion step cannot proceed, so there is no amplification of $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ and no prion-driven pathology in those cells.\n\nIn the described chimeric mouse, only the grafted wild-type brain tissue expresses $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$; the surrounding *PRNP*-null host brain does not. After intracerebral inoculation with $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$, the seeded conversion and exponential accumulation can occur within the grafted tissue because it provides the required substrate $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$. Consequently, the graft will show $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ accumulation, spongiform change, and reactive gliosis.\n\nBy contrast, in the *PRNP*-null host tissue, there is no $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ to convert, so any $\\text{PrP}^\\text{Sc}$ that diffuses into the host cannot replicate. Without local replication and accumulation, the characteristic prion pathology does not develop in the host tissue. While innate mechanisms (e.g., microglial uptake) may influence the fate of inoculum, they do not prevent ongoing amplification inside the graft where $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$ is present.\n\nEvaluating the options: \n- A is incorrect because widespread pathology requires replication throughout the brain, which the *PRNP*-null host cannot support. \n- B is incorrect because the graft allows replication and pathology; the mouse would not remain entirely normal. \n- C is correct because pathology will localize to the graft that expresses $\\text{PrP}^\\text{C}$, with the *PRNP*-null host tissue remaining free of prion-induced lesions. \n- D is incorrect because spread into *PRNP*-null tissue cannot yield replication or widespread disease. \n- E is incorrect because the graft supports replication; accumulation there will be replicative and progressive, not a non-replicative, static deposit.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is pathology confined to the grafted wild-type tissue with the *PRNP*-null host tissue spared.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2068133"}, {"introduction": "Translating our knowledge of molecular mechanisms into effective therapies requires a quantitative approach.
