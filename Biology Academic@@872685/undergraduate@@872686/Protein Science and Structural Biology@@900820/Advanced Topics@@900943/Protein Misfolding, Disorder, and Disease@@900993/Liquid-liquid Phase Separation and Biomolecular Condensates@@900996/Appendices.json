This first practice problem [@problem_id:2117030] explores how these condensates respond to changes in their chemical environment. By considering the effect of salt concentration, you will apply the fundamental principle of electrostatic screening to predict the stability of a condensate that is primarily stabilized by charge-charge attractions.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a newly discovered protein named 'Coacervin'. This protein is composed of two distinct intrinsically disordered domains: one is a poly-cationic domain rich in positively charged arginine residues, and the other is a poly-anionic domain rich in negatively charged glutamate residues. When Coacervin is placed in a buffer solution with a low salt concentration (10 mM KCl), it spontaneously undergoes Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) to form stable, spherical biomolecular condensates. A researcher then performs an experiment where the concentration of KCl in the buffer is significantly increased to 1 M, while all other conditions, such as protein concentration, pH, and temperature, are held constant.\n\nBased on the described molecular architecture of Coacervin and the fundamental principles governing protein interactions, what is the most probable observation after the addition of the high concentration of salt?\n\nA. The condensates will increase in size and fuse together more readily.\n\nB. The condensates will solidify into an irreversible gel-like state.\n\nC. The condensates will dissolve, resulting in a single, homogeneous solution.\n\nD. The condensates will remain completely unchanged in size, number, and appearance.\n\nE. The condensates will shrink in size but increase in number, keeping the total phase-separated volume constant.", "solution": "The problem describes a protein, Coacervin, that forms biomolecular condensates through Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). The driving force for this phase separation is explicitly linked to the protein's structure: it possesses a poly-cationic domain (rich in positive charges) and a poly-anionic domain (rich in negative charges). The formation of condensates is therefore primarily stabilized by electrostatic attractions between the oppositely charged regions on different Coacervin molecules.\n\nThe experiment involves a significant increase in the salt (KCl) concentration of the solution. In an aqueous solution, KCl, an ionic salt, dissociates into potassium cations ($K^{+}$) and chloride anions ($Cl^{-}$). These mobile ions permeate the solution and interact with the charged residues on the Coacervin protein.\n\nThe core physical principle at play is electrostatic screening, also known as the Debye screening effect. The dissociated salt ions form a 'cloud' of counter-ions around the charged domains of the protein. Specifically, the negative chloride anions ($Cl^{-}$) will preferentially accumulate around the positively charged poly-cationic arginine domains, while the positive potassium cations ($K^{+}$) will accumulate around the negatively charged poly-anionic glutamate domains.\n\nThis cloud of counter-ions effectively neutralizes, or \"screens,\" the electrostatic charges on the protein domains. The presence of the salt ions weakens the long-range electrostatic attraction between the poly-cationic domain of one Coacervin molecule and the poly-anionic domain of another. Since this electrostatic attraction is the primary interaction holding the condensate together, weakening it destabilizes the phase-separated state.\n\nWhen the salt concentration is increased to a high level (1 M), the screening effect becomes very strong. The attractive forces between Coacervin molecules are reduced to a point where they are no longer sufficient to overcome the entropic cost of demixing. Consequently, the system favors a mixed state over a phase-separated one. The condensates will dissolve back into the bulk solution, resulting in a single, homogeneous phase where the protein molecules are uniformly distributed.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Increasing size would imply stronger attractions, which is the opposite of the effect of salt screening.\nB. Solidification is a different phase transition, not the direct consequence of weakening the transient electrostatic interactions that define LLPS.\nC. Dissolution is the direct consequence of weakening the attractive forces that drive phase separation. This is the correct outcome.\nD. No change is incorrect because a significant change in ionic strength will always have a major impact on dominant electrostatic interactions.\nE. Shrinking but increasing in number is not the expected behavior. This might suggest the formation of smaller, more numerous nucleation sites, but the overall effect of charge screening is to raise the saturation concentration required for LLPS, which leads to dissolution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2117030"}, {"introduction": "Beyond responding to global changes in the cellular environment, cells actively regulate the formation and dissolution of condensates using precise biochemical tools. This problem [@problem_id:2116975] introduces Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) as a critical on/off switch for liquid-liquid phase separation. You will analyze how adding negatively charged phosphate groups can disrupt the cation-$\\pi$ interactions stabilizing a condensate, illustrating a key mechanism of biological control over intracellular organization.", "problem": "A hypothetical protein, named \"Assemblin,\" plays a crucial role in cellular organization by undergoing Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). This process is driven by its Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR), a segment of the protein that lacks a stable three-dimensional structure. The IDR of Assemblin is notably rich in two types of amino acid residues: arginine, which has a positively charged side chain (a cation), and tyrosine, which has an aromatic side chain with an electron-rich pi ($\\pi$) system. The multivalent cation-$\\pi$ interactions between these many arginine and tyrosine residues are the primary driving force for Assemblin to demix from the cytoplasm and form dense, liquid-like biomolecular condensates.\n\nA cell can regulate this process through Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs). Consider a scenario where a specific kinase enzyme becomes active and phosphorylates every serine residue located within Assemblin's IDR. Phosphorylation is the addition of a bulky, negatively charged phosphate group to an amino acid.\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces, what is the most likely effect of this widespread serine phosphorylation on the ability of Assemblin to undergo LLPS?\n\nA. Phase separation will be enhanced, as the newly introduced phosphate groups will form strong salt bridges with the cationic arginine residues, creating a more stable and extensive interaction network.\n\nB. Phase separation will be unaffected, as the serine residues are not directly involved in the cation-$\\pi$ interactions and their modification only alters the surface charge of the folded protein core.\n\nC. The protein will transition from forming reversible liquid-like condensates to forming solid, irreversible aggregates due to uncontrolled electrostatic cross-linking.\n\nD. Phase separation will be inhibited, as the introduced negative charges will create electrostatic repulsion with the electron-rich $\\pi$ systems of the tyrosine residues, weakening the net attractive forces required for condensation.", "solution": "The driving force for Assemblin’s LLPS is multivalent cation-π interactions between positively charged arginine side chains and the electron-rich π systems of tyrosine rings. Such cation-π attractions are favorable electrostatic interactions that, when repeated across many sites in an IDR, form a percolated network that promotes demixing and liquid-like condensation.\n\nPhosphorylation of serine residues in the IDR introduces bulky, negatively charged phosphate groups throughout the same disordered segment that mediates LLPS. The consequences for the interaction network are as follows:\n1) **Competitive binding to arginine:** The anionic phosphate groups form strong ion pairs (salt bridges) with cationic arginine side chains. These interactions directly compete with and sequester arginine away from participating in cation-π interactions with tyrosine, reducing the number of contacts that drive LLPS.\n2) **Electrostatic repulsion and solvation:** The added negative charges increase the net negative charge of the IDR, enhancing intrachain and interchain electrostatic repulsion. This also increases favorable interactions with the solvent (water), which expands the protein chain and raises the saturation concentration for phase separation, thus inhibiting LLPS.\n\nEvaluating the options based on these principles:\n- A is incorrect. While salt bridges form, they divert arginine from the cation-π interactions that are essential for LLPS, thereby reducing, not enhancing, phase separation.\n- B is incorrect. The modifications occur in the IDR that directly mediates LLPS, so altering its charge pattern strongly affects phase behavior.\n- C is unlikely. Widespread phosphorylation in IDRs typically increases solubility and inhibits LLPS, rather than causing a transition to a solid, irreversible aggregate.\n- D is correct. The phosphorylation inhibits phase separation by weakening the net attractive forces required for condensation, as detailed above.\n\nTherefore, widespread serine phosphorylation in the IDR is most likely to inhibit Assemblin’s ability to undergo LLPS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2116975"}, {"introduction": "A key function of many condensates is to act as hubs, selectively concentrating specific \"client\" molecules to regulate biochemical pathways.
