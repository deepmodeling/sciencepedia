In smFRET experiments, a common artifact is the temporary \"blinking\" of a fluorophore, which can be mistaken for a conformational change.

Mastering this distinction is crucial for drawing reliable conclusions from smFRET time traces.

The protein is labeled with a donor fluorophore (D) and an acceptor fluorophore (A). The experiment measures the fluorescence intensity from the donor, $I_D$, and the acceptor, $I_A$, over time.\n\nThe protein is initially observed in a stable, high-FRET \"closed\" conformation (State 0). The time trace then shows two distinct, transient events where the FRET efficiency drops to a low value. The investigator needs to determine if these events are genuine conformational transitions to an \"open\" state or simply a photophysical artifact where the acceptor fluorophore temporarily enters a non-emissive \"dark state\" (blinking).\n\nThe measured intensities (in arbitrary units of counts per millisecond, counts/ms) for the initial state and the two subsequent low-FRET events are provided below:\n- **State 0 (Initial High-FRET):** $I_{D,0}=200$ counts/ms, $I_{A,0}=800$ counts/ms.\n- **Event 1 (Transition to State 1):** $I_{D,1}=750$ counts/ms, $I_{A,1}=250$ counts/ms.\n- **Event 2 (Transition to State 2):** $I_{D,2}=600$ counts/ms, $I_{A,2}=10$ counts/ms.\n\nTo distinguish between the two possibilities, a common criterion is to analyze the total intensity, defined as $I_{tot} = I_D + I_A$. A genuine conformational change is expected to roughly conserve the total detected intensity, whereas a photophysical artifact like blinking typically causes a significant change.\n\nLet's define the relative change in total intensity for an event $i$ (where $i=1$ or $2$) as:\n$$\n\\Delta I_{rel,i} = \\frac{|I_{tot,i} - I_{tot,0}|}{I_{tot,0}}\n$$\nwhere $I_{tot,i}$ is the total intensity in state $i$ and $I_{tot,0}$ is the total intensity in the initial state.

The classification is based on the change in the total fluorescence intensity, $I_{tot} = I_D + I_A$.\n\nThe core principle is that a genuine conformational change involves a redistribution of energy between the donor and acceptor, which should ideally conserve the total number of detected photons if the detection efficiencies and quantum yields of the two fluorophores are similar. In contrast, if the acceptor fluorophore enters a dark state (blinks), it ceases to emit photons, causing a significant change in the total detected intensity. The problem provides a specific quantitative criterion for this classification: if the relative change in total intensity, $\\Delta I_{rel,i}$, is greater than $0.10$ (or 10%), the event is considered a blinking artifact.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total intensity for the initial high-FRET state (State 0).\nThe given intensities are $I_{D,0} = 200$ counts/ms and $I_{A,0} = 800$ counts/ms.\nThe total intensity for State 0 is:\n$$\nI_{tot,0} = I_{D,0} + I_{A,0} = 200 + 800 = 1000\\ \\text{counts/ms}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze Event 1, which is a transition to State 1.\nThe intensities for State 1 are given as $I_{D,1} = 750$ counts/ms and $I_{A,1} = 250$ counts/ms.\nThe total intensity for State 1 is:\n$$\nI_{tot,1} = I_{D,1} + I_{A,1} = 750 + 250 = 1000\\ \\text{counts/ms}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the relative change in total intensity for Event 1:\n$$\n\\Delta I_{rel,1} = \\frac{|I_{tot,1} - I_{tot,0}|}{I_{tot,0}} = \\frac{|1000 - 1000|}{1000} = \\frac{0}{1000} = 0\n$$\nAccording to the criterion, since $\\Delta I_{rel,1} = 0$, which is not greater than $0.10$, Event 1 is classified as a genuine conformational change.\n\nNow, we analyze Event 2, which is a transition to State 2.\nThe intensities for State 2 are given as $I_{D,2} = 600$ counts/ms and $I_{A,2} = 10$ counts/ms.\nThe total intensity for State 2 is:\n$$\nI_{tot,2} = I_{D,2} + I_{A,2} = 600 + 10 = 610\\ \\text{counts/ms}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the relative change in total intensity for Event 2:\n$$\n\\Delta I_{rel,2} = \\frac{|I_{tot,2} - I_{tot,0}|}{I_{tot,0}} = \\frac{|610 - 1000|}{1000} = \\frac{|-390|}{1000} = \\frac{390}{1000} = 0.39\n$$\nAccording to the criterion, since $\\Delta I_{rel,2} = 0.39$, which is greater than $0.10$, Event 2 is classified as an acceptor blinking artifact.\n\nIn summary:\n- Event 1 is a conformational change.\n- Event 2 is a blinking event.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2137696"}]}
