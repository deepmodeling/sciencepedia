Both Mutant A and Mutant B will fold into stable, functional enzymes, as the $(\\text{Gly})_5$ insertion is chemically inert and flexible, allowing the protein to accommodate the change.\n\nB. Mutant A is likely to severely misfold and lose all function due to the disruption of the loop's specific length and conformation, while Mutant B will fold correctly with only a minor structural perturbation.\n\nC. Mutant B is highly likely to misfold, form aggregates, and be completely non-functional, whereas Mutant A has a high probability of folding into a stable and functional, or near-functional, structure.\n\nD. Both Mutant A and Mutant B will misfold and be non-functional because any insertion of this size fundamentally disrupts the sequence-to-structure relationship required for proper folding.", "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate the likely impact of inserting a five-residue glycine linker into two different structural contexts within a protein: a surface loop and the core of a beta-sheet. To answer this, we must consider the distinct structural roles and constraints of these two features.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structural properties of a surface loop (Mutant A).**\nSurface loops are segments of polypeptides that connect regular secondary structure elements like alpha-helices and beta-sheets. By their nature, they are located on the exterior of the protein, exposed to the solvent (water). Key characteristics of surface loops include:\n- **Flexibility:** They are generally more flexible and conformationally dynamic than core structures.\n- **Tolerance to mutation:** Comparing homologous proteins (proteins with a shared evolutionary origin) reveals that loops often show significant variation in both amino acid sequence and length. This indicates that they are evolutionarily plastic and can tolerate insertions, deletions, and substitutions more readily than structurally-constrained regions.\n- **Structural role:** Their primary role is often simply to connect other structural elements in the correct topology. Unless they are part of a functional site (which is explicitly excluded in the problem statement for Mutant A), their exact conformation is less critical to the overall stability of the protein fold.\n\nGiven these properties, inserting a $(\\text{Gly})_5$ sequence into a surface loop is unlikely to be catastrophic. Glycine is a small and flexible amino acid. The insertion will lengthen the loop, likely increasing its flexibility, but it will probably not prevent the flanking alpha-helices and beta-sheets, and the rest of the protein core, from folding and assembling correctly. Therefore, Mutant A is likely to fold into a stable structure and retain most, if not all, of its function.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structural properties of a core beta-sheet (Mutant B).**\nBeta-sheets are a major type of secondary structure, formed by one or more beta-strands linked laterally by hydrogen bonds between atoms of the polypeptide backbone. A beta-sheet located in the protein core has very different properties from a surface loop:\n- **Rigidity and Regularity:** Beta-sheets are rigid, highly ordered structures. Their stability depends on a precise, repeating pattern of hydrogen bonds between the backbone C=O group of one strand and the N-H group of an adjacent strand.\n- **Dense Packing:** The protein core is a densely packed environment. The side chains of the residues in the core beta-sheet are tightly interdigitated with each other and with other parts of the protein, minimizing empty space. This packing is critical for the protein's overall stability.\n- **Intolerance to disruption:** The regular hydrogen bond network is the defining feature of a beta-sheet. Inserting five residues into the *middle* of a single beta-strand would completely break this pattern. The original N-terminal half of the strand would no longer be adjacent to the C-terminal half, making it impossible to form the original set of hydrogen bonds with the neighboring strand in the sheet. This is a catastrophic disruption of a major, stabilizing secondary structure element.\n\nThis disruption in the hydrophobic core would expose nonpolar surfaces that should be buried, leading to a massive loss of conformational stability. The protein would be unable to achieve its native fold. Misfolded proteins with exposed hydrophobic patches have a strong tendency to stick to each other, leading to the formation of insoluble aggregates. Consequently, Mutant B is almost certain to be misfolded, non-functional, and prone to aggregation.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the outcomes and select the correct option.**\n- **Mutant A:** Likely to fold correctly and be functional.\n- **Mutant B:** Highly likely to misfold, aggregate, and be non-functional.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n- A is incorrect because it ignores the catastrophic effect of the insertion in the beta-sheet core.\n- B is incorrect as it reverses the expected outcomes. Loops are tolerant, core sheets are not.\n- C correctly states that the core insertion (Mutant B) is highly disruptive, leading to misfolding and aggregation, while the loop insertion (Mutant A) is likely to be tolerated. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n- D is incorrect because it overstates the case against Mutant A. Surface loops are known to be variable and tolerant regions of protein structures.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2117533"}, {"introduction": "Loop flexibility is not just tolerated; it is often essential for function, acting as a molecular switch or gate. This exercise [@problem_id:2117553] explores the common \"lid\" loop motif, which controls access to an enzyme's active site. Your task is to predict how deleting this lid affects the enzyme's kinetic parameters, providing a direct link between structural dynamics and catalytic efficiency, as measured by $K_M$ and $k_{cat}$.", "problem": "A hypothetical enzyme, Catalase-Like Oxidase (CLO), catalyzes the conversion of substrate S to product P. The structure of CLO features a flexible loop of 20 amino acids that acts as a \"lid\" over the active site. In the absence of substrate, CLO exists predominantly in an \"open\" conformation where the active site is accessible to the solvent. Upon binding of substrate S, the lid loop undergoes a conformational change, closing over the active site to form the \"closed\" conformation. This closed state is essential for sequestering the substrate from water and orienting it precisely for catalysis.\n\nThe wild-type CLO enzyme exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Michaelis constant ($K_M$) of 50 µM and a catalytic rate constant ($k_{cat}$) of 100 s⁻¹.\n\nA biochemist creates a mutant version of CLO in which the entire 20-amino-acid lid loop is deleted, while the rest of the protein, including all active site residues, remains intact. Assuming this new mutant protein folds into a stable, soluble conformation that resembles the \"open\" state of the wild-type enzyme, which of the following outcomes is the most likely description of its kinetic parameters compared to the wild-type enzyme?\n\nA. A significant decrease in $K_M$ and a significant increase in $k_{cat}$.\n\nB. A significant increase in $K_M$ and a significant decrease in $k_{cat}$.\n\nC. No significant change in $K_M$ but a significant decrease in $k_{cat}$.\n\nD. A significant increase in $K_M$ but no significant change in $k_{cat}$.\n\nE. The enzyme will be completely inactive, showing no measurable catalytic activity.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely kinetic effect of deleting a functional \"lid\" loop from an enzyme. To determine this, we must analyze the function of the loop in the wild-type enzyme and then deduce the consequences of its absence on the kinetic parameters $K_M$ and $k_{cat}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the function of the lid loop. The problem states that upon substrate binding, the loop closes over the active site. This \"closed\" conformation serves two critical functions:\n1.  **Enhancing Substrate Binding:** The closed state sequesters the substrate, creating a specific microenvironment that is more favorable for binding than the solvent-exposed \"open\" state. This induced-fit mechanism leads to a high binding affinity.\n2.  **Optimizing Catalysis:** The closed state orients the substrate precisely relative to the catalytic residues in the active site, ensuring an optimal geometry for the chemical reaction to proceed efficiently.\n\nNext, we consider the mutant enzyme, which lacks the lid loop. The problem states that this mutant is stable in a conformation that mimics the \"open\" state of the wild-type enzyme. This implies that the mutant enzyme is essentially trapped in this open, low-affinity state and cannot undergo the transition to the high-affinity, catalytically-optimal closed state.\n\nNow, we can predict the impact on the kinetic parameters:\n\n**Effect on $K_M$**: The Michaelis constant, $K_M$, is the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of its maximum. It is inversely related to the apparent affinity of the enzyme for its substrate; a low $K_M$ indicates high affinity. The wild-type enzyme's ability to switch to a high-affinity closed state contributes to its low overall $K_M$. The mutant enzyme, being stuck in the low-affinity open state, will bind the substrate much more weakly. Consequently, a much higher substrate concentration will be needed to half-saturate the enzyme. Therefore, the $K_M$ of the mutant is expected to increase significantly.\n\n**Effect on $k_{cat}$**: The catalytic constant, $k_{cat}$, or turnover number, represents the maximum rate of the catalytic reaction when the enzyme is saturated with substrate. It reflects the intrinsic efficiency of the catalytic step. The problem explicitly states that the closed conformation is crucial for the precise orientation of the substrate for catalysis. Since the mutant enzyme cannot form this closed state, the substrate, even when bound, will not be positioned optimally within the active site. This misalignment significantly reduces the efficiency of the chemical conversion. Therefore, the $k_{cat}$ of the mutant is expected to decrease significantly.\n\nIn summary, the deletion of the lid loop cripples the enzyme's ability to both bind its substrate tightly and to catalyze the reaction efficiently. This corresponds to a large increase in $K_M$ and a large decrease in $k_{cat}$.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given choices:\nA. A decrease in $K_M$ and an increase in $k_{cat}$ is the opposite of our finding.\nB. An increase in $K_M$ and a decrease in $k_{cat}$ perfectly matches our analysis.\nC. No change in $K_M$ is incorrect, as the binding mechanism is fundamentally altered.\nD. No change in $k_{cat}$ is incorrect, as the catalytic geometry is no longer optimal.\nE. Complete inactivity is an extreme and less likely scenario. The active site residues are still present, so some residual, inefficient catalysis is probable.\n\nThus, the most plausible outcome is a significant increase in $K_M$ and a significant decrease in $k_{cat}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2117553"}, {"introduction": "The properties of surface loops are finely balanced to ensure a protein remains soluble and functional in its cellular environment. In this final practice [@problem_id:2117543], we investigate the consequences of disrupting this balance. You will analyze how a single mutation in a surface loop can introduce a patch of hydrophobicity, providing a molecular-level explanation for protein misfolding and aggregation, phenomena linked to numerous diseases.", "problem": "A hypothetical soluble enzyme, named \"Aquaphilin,\" functions in the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell. Its native three-dimensional structure is crucial for its catalytic activity. The protein's surface is predominantly covered with hydrophilic amino acids, allowing it to remain dissolved in the aqueous cytoplasm. However, a particular surface-exposed loop, referred to as the \"Omega loop,\" is known to be conformationally flexible and is composed of the following short sequence of amino acids: Glycine-Serine-Aspartate-Serine-Glycine.\n\nGenetic analysis of a non-functional variant of Aquaphilin reveals a single point mutation. This mutation results in the substitution of the central Aspartate residue in the Omega loop with a Leucine residue. Cells expressing this mutant protein exhibit a dramatic decrease in Aquaphilin activity and show the formation of intracellular protein aggregates.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of protein chemistry and folding, which of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular mechanism for how this single amino acid substitution leads to protein aggregation and loss of function?\n\nA. The newly introduced Leucine, being hydrophobic, creates an energetically unfavorable \"greasy\" patch on the protein's surface. To minimize contact with the aqueous cytoplasm, this hydrophobic patch on one mutant protein molecule interacts with a similar patch on another, initiating a chain reaction of intermolecular association that leads to aggregation.\n\nB. The loss of the negatively charged Aspartate and its replacement with the neutral Leucine disrupts a critical salt bridge with a nearby Lysine on an adjacent alpha-helix, causing the entire protein to unfold.\n\nC. The Leucine residue, being larger than Aspartate, sterically hinders the normal flexibility of the Omega loop, locking the enzyme in a permanently inactive conformation without causing aggregation.\n\nD. The substitution of Aspartate with Leucine creates a novel cleavage site for a cytoplasmic protease, leading to the rapid degradation of the protein and a loss of function due to its absence.\n\nE. The Leucine residue spontaneously forms a covalent disulfide bond with a cysteine residue elsewhere on the protein surface, leading to an incorrect tertiary structure and subsequent aggregation.", "solution": "We apply fundamental thermodynamics of protein folding and solvation. The stability of a folded protein arises from minimizing the Gibbs free energy, with a dominant contribution from the hydrophobic effect for soluble proteins. For a protein in water, the free energy change can be written schematically as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}=\\Delta H - T \\Delta S = \\Delta G_{\\text{hydrophobic}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{H-bond}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{electrostatic}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}} + \\ldots\n$$\nA key driving force is the burial of hydrophobic surface area, which lowers free energy by reducing the ordered water shell. Upon intermolecular association that buries hydrophobic patches, a useful approximation is\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{assoc}} \\approx -\\gamma \\Delta A_{\\text{buried}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{other}},\n$$\nwith $\\gamma > 0$ and $\\Delta A_{\\text{buried}}$ the hydrophobic surface area buried upon association. Thus, creating an exposed hydrophobic patch can render association favorable because it increases $\\Delta A_{\\text{buried}}$ when two such patches pack together, driving aggregation.\n\nIn the wild-type loop Gly-Ser-Aspartate-Ser-Gly, the central Aspartate is negatively charged in the cytoplasm and highly solvated, contributing favorable polar interactions with water. Replacing Aspartate with Leucine substitutes a charged, hydrophilic side chain with a nonpolar, hydrophobic side chain on a solvent-exposed, flexible loop. This creates a hydrophobic “greasy” patch on the otherwise hydrophilic surface. The solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch is energetically unfavorable in isolation, increasing $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}$ for the monomer. Aggregation between mutant molecules allows these patches to be buried at intermolecular interfaces, making $\\Delta G_{\\text{assoc}}$ negative via the $-\\gamma \\Delta A_{\\text{buried}}$ term, and initiating a chain of oligomerization that proceeds to aggregates. Such aggregation sequesters the enzyme into inactive assemblies and reduces the concentration of properly folded, soluble, catalytically competent protein, explaining the loss of function.\n\nAlternative options are less consistent with the given context:\n- For B, disruption of a salt bridge would contribute a modest stabilization in aqueous cytoplasm because electrostatic interactions on the surface are screened; an approximate form is $\\Delta G_{\\text{salt}} \\sim -\\frac{k q_{1} q_{2}}{\\varepsilon r}$, with large $\\varepsilon$ for water, so loss of a single surface salt bridge in a flexible loop is unlikely to cause wholesale unfolding, and does not specifically account for the observed aggregation as parsimoniously as the hydrophobic patch mechanism.\n- For C, steric restriction alone cannot explain the experimentally observed aggregation; the statement explicitly contradicts the presence of aggregates.\n- For D, creation of a protease cleavage site would lead primarily to degradation and reduced protein levels, not to accumulation of intracellular aggregates.\n- For E, Leucine cannot form disulfide bonds; disulfide bonds form between Cysteine residues only, so this is chemically invalid.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible mechanism is the exposure of a hydrophobic patch that drives intermolecular association and aggregation, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2117543"}]}
