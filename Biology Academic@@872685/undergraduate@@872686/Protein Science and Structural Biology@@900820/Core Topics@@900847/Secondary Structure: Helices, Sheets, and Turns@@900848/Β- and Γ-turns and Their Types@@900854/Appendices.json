This practice explores the fundamental stereochemical principles that govern residue propensities in turns. Understanding why certain residues, like those with β-branched side chains, are disfavored provides critical insight into the rules of protein folding [@problem_id:2151413].", "problem": "In protein structures, a β-turn is a common motif where the polypeptide chain reverses its direction over a span of four amino acid residues, typically denoted as `i`, `i+1`, `i+2`, and `i+3`. This tight turn is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of residue `i` and the amide proton of residue `i+3`. The specific geometry of a β-turn is highly dependent on the backbone dihedral angles, phi ($\\phi$) and psi ($\\psi$), of the central residues, `i+1` and `i+2`.\n\nAmino acids such as Valine (Val) and Isoleucine (Ile) possess side chains that are described as \"β-branched,\" meaning the branching occurs at the Cβ atom, the first carbon of the side chain. It is an established observation in structural biology that Valine and Isoleucine are strongly disfavored at the central positions (`i+1` and `i+2`) of most common β-turn types.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The β-branched side chain creates significant steric hindrance with atoms of the polypeptide main chain, which is incompatible with the tight geometry required for the turn.\n\nB. The side chains of Valine and Isoleucine are highly hydrophobic, and since β-turns must be located on the protein surface, these residues are excluded to avoid unfavorable interactions with water.\n\nC. The bulky side chains of Valine and Isoleucine physically block the formation of the crucial hydrogen bond between the main-chain atoms of residues `i` and `i+3`.\n\nD. The β-branched side chains are incapable of forming the specific intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the backbone that are necessary to stabilize the central positions of the turn.\n\nE. The partial positive charges on the β-branched side chains cause electrostatic repulsion with the amide protons of the polypeptide backbone, destabilizing the turn structure.", "solution": "A β-turn imposes specific main-chain geometry: residues at positions i and i+3 form a backbone hydrogen bond, and the central residues i+1 and i+2 must adopt particular backbone dihedral angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ characteristic of the turn type (for common types I and II, these angles fall in regions that are sterically restrictive). The fundamental constraint governing whether a residue can occupy such conformations is steric compatibility as captured by the Ramachandran plot, which reflects excluded-volume (van der Waals) repulsions between side-chain atoms and the polypeptide backbone.\n\nValine and isoleucine are $\\beta$-branched: they have two substituents at the C$\\beta$ atom. This branching places additional side-chain bulk close to the backbone, increasing the likelihood of steric clashes with backbone atoms (e.g., carbonyl oxygen of residue i or amide nitrogen/alpha carbons of neighboring residues) when the backbone attempts to adopt the tight $\\phi/\\psi$ values required at i+1 and i+2 in most $\\beta$-turns. Consequently, many of the $\\phi/\\psi$ combinations needed for these central positions lie in regions of the Ramachandran space that are disfavored for $\\beta$-branched residues due to steric hindrance, raising the conformational energy and making these residues uncommon at these positions.\n\nBy contrast, hydrophobicity (choice B) is not the fundamental determinant because $\\beta$-turns are not required to be on the surface and hydrophobic residues can and do appear in turns depending on context. The side chains do not generally block the main-chain i to i+3 hydrogen bond (choice C), which is formed between backbone atoms and is largely independent of side-chain presence at i+1 and i+2. Specific side-chain hydrogen bonding at these positions is not required for turn stabilization (choice D), since the defining stabilizing interaction is the main-chain hydrogen bond. Finally, there is no general partial positive charge on $\\beta$-branched side chains that would cause electrostatic repulsion with backbone amide protons (choice E); these side chains are largely hydrocarbon and neutral.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is the steric incompatibility of $\\beta$-branched side chains with the tight backbone geometry required for most $\\beta$-turns at the central positions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2151413"}, {"introduction": "A key goal in structural biology is to predict three-dimensional structure from the primary amino acid sequence.
