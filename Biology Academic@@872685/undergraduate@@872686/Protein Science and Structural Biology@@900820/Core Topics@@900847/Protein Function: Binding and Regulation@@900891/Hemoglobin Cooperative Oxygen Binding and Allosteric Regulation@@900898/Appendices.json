This first practice invites you to do just that by comparing hemoglobin's oxygen binding with that of myoglobin. By calculating their respective oxygen saturation levels under different physiological conditions—from the oxygen-rich environment of the lungs to oxygen-depleted muscle tissue—you will quantitatively demonstrate why hemoglobin's cooperative binding is crucial for its role as an efficient oxygen transporter [@problem_id:2113020].", "problem": "Myoglobin (Mb) and hemoglobin (Hb) are two oxygen-binding proteins with distinct roles in the body. Myoglobin, a monomeric protein in muscle tissue, stores oxygen. Hemoglobin, a tetrameric protein in red blood cells, transports oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.\n\nThe fractional saturation ($Y$) of myoglobin with oxygen as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen ($p\\text{O}_2$) follows the equation:\n$$Y_{Mb} = \\frac{p\\text{O}_2}{p_{50,Mb} + p\\text{O}_2}$$\nwhere $p_{50,Mb}$ is the partial pressure at which myoglobin is 50% saturated. For myoglobin, $p_{50,Mb} = 2.8$ torr.\n\nThe fractional saturation of hemoglobin is more complex due to cooperative binding between its four subunits. Its behavior is well-approximated by the Hill equation:\n$$Y_{Hb} = \\frac{(p\\text{O}_2)^n}{ (p_{50,Hb})^n + (p\\text{O}_2)^n }$$\nwhere $p_{50,Hb}$ is the partial pressure at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, a measure of cooperativity.

We will then use these calculated values to assess the validity of each statement.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- For Myoglobin (Mb): $p_{50,Mb} = 2.8$ torr.\n- For Hemoglobin (Hb): $p_{50,Hb} = 26$ torr and $n = 2.8$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate fractional saturation in the lungs ($p\\text{O}_2 = 100$ torr).**\n\nFor myoglobin:\n$$Y_{Mb, lungs} = \\frac{p\\text{O}_2}{p_{50,Mb} + p\\text{O}_2} = \\frac{100}{2.8 + 100} = \\frac{100}{102.8} \\approx 0.9728$$\n\nFor hemoglobin:\n$$Y_{Hb, lungs} = \\frac{(p\\text{O}_2)^n}{(p_{50,Hb})^n + (p\\text{O}_2)^n} = \\frac{(100)^{2.8}}{(26)^{2.8} + (100)^{2.8}}$$\nTo simplify the calculation, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $(100)^{2.8}$:\n$$Y_{Hb, lungs} = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{26}{100})^{2.8} + 1} = \\frac{1}{(0.26)^{2.8} + 1} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.0266 + 1} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.0266} \\approx 0.9741$$\n\nIn the lungs, both proteins are almost fully saturated with oxygen ($\\approx 97\\%$ saturation).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate fractional saturation in active muscle tissue ($p\\text{O}_2 = 20$ torr).**\n\nFor myoglobin:\n$$Y_{Mb, muscle} = \\frac{p\\text{O}_2}{p_{50,Mb} + p\\text{O}_2} = \\frac{20}{2.8 + 20} = \\frac{20}{22.8} \\approx 0.8772$$\n\nFor hemoglobin:\n$$Y_{Hb, muscle} = \\frac{(p\\text{O}_2)^n}{(p_{50,Hb})^n + (p\\text{O}_2)^n} = \\frac{(20)^{2.8}}{(26)^{2.8} + (20)^{2.8}}$$\nTo simplify, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $(20)^{2.8}$:\n$$Y_{Hb, muscle} = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{26}{20})^{2.8} + 1} = \\frac{1}{(1.3)^{2.8} + 1} \\approx \\frac{1}{2.397 + 1} \\approx \\frac{1}{3.397} \\approx 0.2944$$\n\nIn active muscle, myoglobin is still highly saturated ($\\approx 88\\%$), while hemoglobin's saturation has dropped significantly (to $\\approx 29\\%$).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each statement based on the calculations.**\n\n**A. In the lungs ($p\\text{O}_2 = 100$ torr), myoglobin is significantly less saturated with oxygen than hemoglobin.**\nOur calculations show $Y_{Mb, lungs} \\approx 0.973$ and $Y_{Hb, lungs} \\approx 0.974$. These values are nearly identical. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**B. Hemoglobin's higher $p_{50}$ value indicates that it binds oxygen more tightly than myoglobin at all partial pressures.**\nThe $p_{50}$ value is the partial pressure required to achieve 50% saturation. A *lower* $p_{50}$ indicates a *higher* affinity for the ligand (oxygen). Since $p_{50,Mb} (2.8 \\text{ torr}) < p_{50,Hb} (26 \\text{ torr})$, myoglobin has a much higher affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**C. The total amount of oxygen released by myoglobin as $p\\text{O}_2$ drops from 100 torr to 20 torr is greater than the amount released by hemoglobin.**\nThe amount of oxygen released is proportional to the change in fractional saturation ($\\Delta Y = Y_{lungs} - Y_{muscle}$).\nFor myoglobin: $\\Delta Y_{Mb} = Y_{Mb, lungs} - Y_{Mb, muscle} \\approx 0.9728 - 0.8772 = 0.0956$.\nFor hemoglobin: $\\Delta Y_{Hb} = Y_{Hb, lungs} - Y_{Hb, muscle} \\approx 0.9741 - 0.2944 = 0.6797$.\nHemoglobin releases a much larger fraction of its bound oxygen ($\\approx 68\\%$) than myoglobin ($\\approx 10\\%$) over this range of partial pressures. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**D. In muscle tissue ($p\\text{O}_2 = 20$ torr), myoglobin has a much higher fractional saturation than hemoglobin, which creates a pressure gradient that facilitates the transfer of oxygen from the blood to the muscle cells.**\nOur calculations show $Y_{Mb, muscle} \\approx 0.877$ and $Y_{Hb, muscle} \\approx 0.294$. Myoglobin's saturation is indeed much higher. This high affinity (low $p_{50}$) of myoglobin ensures that it can effectively bind the oxygen released by the lower-affinity hemoglobin in the blood. This difference in affinity drives the net movement of oxygen from blood (hemoglobin) to muscle tissue (myoglobin). This statement accurately describes the physiological function and is supported by our calculations. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**E. At the $p_{50}$ of hemoglobin ($p\\text{O}_2 = 26$ torr), myoglobin is also approximately 50% saturated.**\nAt $p\\text{O}_2 = 26$ torr, hemoglobin is by definition 50% saturated. Let's calculate myoglobin's saturation at this pressure:\n$$Y_{Mb (at\\;26\\;torr)} = \\frac{26}{2.8 + 26} = \\frac{26}{28.8} \\approx 0.9028$$\nAt 26 torr, myoglobin is over 90% saturated, not 50%.

This exercise explores the Bohr effect, a cornerstone of allosteric regulation, where changes in blood pH alter hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen.

The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is cooperative, resulting in a characteristic sigmoidal (S-shaped) oxygen-dissociation curve when plotting the percent saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen against the partial pressure of oxygen ($p\\text{O}_2$). The affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is sensitive to various allosteric modulators, including the pH of the blood.\n\nConsider a physiological scenario where a patient's systemic arterial blood pH increases significantly from its normal value of 7.4 to 7.6.

Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases, causing the oxygen-dissociation curve to shift to the left and leading to reduced oxygen release in the tissues.\n\nC. The cooperative binding of oxygen is eliminated, causing the sigmoidal oxygen-dissociation curve to become hyperbolic, similar to that of myoglobin.\n\nD. The maximum oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is reduced, meaning that even at high $p\\text{O}_2$ in the lungs, hemoglobin cannot become fully saturated.\n\nE. Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases, leading to more efficient oxygen uptake in the lungs and consequently improved oxygen delivery to the tissues.", "solution": "We define the fractional saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen, $Y$, using the Hill equation for cooperative binding:\n$$\nY = \\frac{(p\\text{O}_2)^{n_{H}}}{(p\\text{O}_2)^{n_{H}} + p_{50}^{n_{H}}},\n$$\nwhere $n_{H} > 1$ reflects cooperativity and $p_{50}$ is the partial pressure at which $Y = \\frac{1}{2}$. A leftward shift of the oxygen-dissociation curve corresponds to a decrease in $p_{50}$ (higher affinity), whereas a rightward shift corresponds to an increase in $p_{50}$ (lower affinity).\n\nBy the Bohr effect, an increase in $\\text{H}^{+}$ concentration (lower pH) decreases oxygen affinity (right shift, larger $p_{50}$), and a decrease in $\\text{H}^{+}$ concentration (higher pH) increases oxygen affinity (left shift, smaller $p_{50}$). Symbolically:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p_{50}}{\\partial \\text{pH}} < 0.\n$$\nTherefore, when pH increases from $7.4$ to $7.6$, $p_{50}$ decreases, shifting the curve to the left and increasing hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen.\n\nTo assess oxygen delivery, compare saturation in lungs and tissues. Let $p\\text{O}_{2,\\text{L}}$ and $p\\text{O}_{2,\\text{T}}$ denote the partial pressures in lungs and tissues, respectively, with corresponding saturations $Y_{\\text{L}}$ and $Y_{\\text{T}}$. From the Hill equation, decreasing $p_{50}$ increases $Y$ at any fixed $p\\text{O}_2$.

With a left shift (higher affinity), $Y_{\\text{T}}$ increases more than $Y_{\\text{L}}$, so $\\Delta Y$ decreases and oxygen release in tissues is reduced.\n\nThis excludes the alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because a right shift (decreased affinity) occurs with decreased pH, not increased pH.\n- C is incorrect because cooperativity (sigmoidal shape, $n_{H} > 1$) is not eliminated by modest pH changes.\n- D is incorrect because maximal capacity (the asymptote $Y \\to 1$ at high $p\\text{O}_2$) is unchanged; $p_{50}$ shifts without reducing capacity.\n- E is incorrect because although uptake in lungs may be slightly facilitated, increased affinity impairs unloading, so overall tissue delivery is not improved.\n\nTherefore, the primary effect of increasing pH from $7.4$ to $7.6$ is an increased hemoglobin affinity with a left shift and reduced oxygen release in tissues.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2112970"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the physiological consequences of cooperativity and its regulation, we now turn to the underlying mathematical framework.
