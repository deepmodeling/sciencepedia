By piecing together the evidence, you'll practice the logical deduction that is central to mechanistic enzymology.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating \"Novazyme,\" a novel hydrolase that is hypothesized to use a covalent catalytic mechanism involving an acidic or hydroxyl-containing residue. To identify the specific catalytic nucleophile, a series of experiments are conducted.\n\nFirst, the wild-type (WT) Novazyme is digested with trypsin, which cleaves C-terminal to Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) residues. A specific peptide, named P12, is isolated. The sequence of P12 is determined to be `Val-Leu-Ser-Gly-Glu-Pro-Asn-Ala-Ile-Gln-Lys`, and its monoisotopic mass is measured as 1447.73 Da.\n\nNext, the WT enzyme is treated with a compound that selectively acetylates the active site nucleophile. After treatment, a tryptic digest reveals that the P12 peptide is now modified (P12*), exhibiting a new mass of 1489.74 Da. The difference in mass between P12* and P12 is due to the net addition of an acetyl moiety ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) with a mass of 42.01 Da. Initial screening has narrowed down the list of potential catalytic nucleophiles within peptide P12 to two candidates: Serine at position 3 (Ser-3) and Glutamic acid at position 5 (Glu-5).\n\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, site-directed mutagenesis is employed. Two mutant enzymes are created: S3A (where Ser-3 is replaced by Alanine) and E5A (where Glu-5 is replaced by Alanine). Both mutant enzymes are treated with the acetylating compound, followed by a tryptic digest. Mass spectrometry of the relevant peptide fragment yields the following key observations:\n-   In the S3A mutant experiment, the peptide corresponding to P12 is found to be acetylated.\n-   In the E5A mutant experiment, the peptide corresponding to P12 is found to be unmodified.\n\nBased on all the provided experimental evidence, identify the catalytic nucleophile in Novazyme. Your answer should be the single-letter code of the amino acid residue.", "solution": "Define the peptide P12 sequence as Val-Leu-Ser-Gly-Glu-Pro-Asn-Ala-Ile-Gln-Lys, with candidate nucleophiles Ser at position $3$ (Ser-3) and Glu at position $5$ (Glu-5). Trypsin cleaves C-terminal to Lys/Arg, so the observed P12 ending in Lys is consistent with a single tryptic peptide containing both candidates.\n\nThe acetylating reagent selectively modifies the active-site nucleophile. Let the acetyl mass be $m_{\\mathrm{Ac}}$, given as $m_{\\mathrm{Ac}}=42.01$. The WT P12 shows a mass shift equal to $m_{\\mathrm{Ac}}$, which implies that within P12 there is exactly one residue that is the catalytic nucleophile and is acetylated:\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{WT}} = m_{\\mathrm{P12^{*}}}-m_{\\mathrm{P12}}=m_{\\mathrm{Ac}}.\n$$\n\nTo identify which candidate is the nucleophile, analyze the mutagenesis outcomes using the selectivity statement:\n- If a residue $X$ is the catalytic nucleophile, then mutating $X$ to Ala removes the nucleophile and prevents selective acetylation on that peptide, so no mass shift by $m_{\\mathrm{Ac}}$ should be observed.\n- Conversely, if mutating $X$ to Ala does not abolish acetylation of the peptide, then $X$ is not the catalytic nucleophile.\n\nApply this logic to the experiments:\n1. S3A mutant: The peptide corresponding to P12 is still found acetylated after treatment. By the selectivity criterion, if Ser-3 were the catalytic nucleophile, S3A would abolish the acetylation. Since acetylation persists, Ser-3 is not the catalytic nucleophile.\n2. E5A mutant: The peptide corresponding to P12 is unmodified after treatment. By the selectivity criterion, this means the residue removed (Glu-5) was required for acetylation, hence Glu-5 is the catalytic nucleophile.\n\nTherefore, the catalytic nucleophile in Novazyme within P12 is Glu-5, whose single-letter code is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2118566"}, {"introduction": "Once a catalytic residue is identified, we can probe its function by changing it through mutagenesis.
