One such common motif found in β-sheets is the Greek key.\n\nConsider a hypothetical protein domain that contains an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The individual β-strands are numbered 1 through 8, consecutively from the N-terminus to the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain. A topological analysis of the folded domain reveals that the spatial arrangement of these eight strands, when viewed side-on, is in the following order:\n\nStrand 1, Strand 8, Strand 5, Strand 4, Strand 3, Strand 6, Strand 7, Strand 2.\n\nA Greek key motif is formed by four β-strands that are consecutive in the primary sequence (e.g., strands $i, i+1, i+2, i+3$).

The spatial arrangement of the strands in the sheet is: 1-8-5-4-3-6-7-2.\n2.  A Greek key motif is formed by four strands that are sequential in the primary chain, denoted as {$i, i+1, i+2, i+3$}, and are spatially adjacent in the sheet with the specific topology $(i+2), (i+1), i, (i+3)$.\n\nOur task is to find which of the given options corresponds to a set of four sequential strands that forms a contiguous block in the sheet with the specified pattern. The order of strands in the sheet is given as a sequence, so we are looking for a subsequence of four strands that matches the pattern. The pattern can be read in either direction, so for a target pattern of A-B-C-D, we must check for both \"A-B-C-D\" and \"D-C-B-A\" within the spatial arrangement sequence.\n\nLet's test each option systemically.\n\n**A.

Understanding this link between form and function is key to appreciating the elegance of protein design [@problem_id:2140395].", "problem": "In the study of protein mechanics, the topological arrangement of secondary structure elements significantly influences their resistance to externally applied forces. Consider two common supersecondary structures, or motifs, each composed of four identical, antiparallel $\\beta$-strands of equal length.\n\nThe first motif is a **$\\beta$-meander**. In this topology, the strands are arranged sequentially within the sheet, such that strand 1 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 2, strand 2 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 3, and strand 3 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 4. The polypeptide chain connects the strands in numerical order, with the N-terminus at the beginning of strand 1 and the C-terminus at the end of strand 4.\n\nThe second motif is a **Greek key**. In this topology, the polypeptide chain also connects strands in the order 1-2-3-4. However, the spatial arrangement of the strands within the final hydrogen-bonded sheet is 4-1-2-3. Consequently, strand 4 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 1, strand 1 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 2, and strand 2 is hydrogen-bonded to strand 3. The N-terminus is at the beginning of strand 1, and the C-terminus is at the end of strand 4.\n\nA theoretical experiment is conducted where a tensile force is applied to the termini of each motif, pulling on the N-terminus of strand 1 and the C-terminus of strand 4. The mechanical resistance to unfolding is defined by the motif's ability to resist separation. This resistance is primarily determined by the number of backbone hydrogen bonds that are loaded in parallel by the pulling force and must be broken simultaneously to initiate unfolding.\n\nBased on this principle, which motif would exhibit greater mechanical resistance to the pulling force, and what is the underlying topological reason?\n\nA. The $\\beta$-meander, because the pulling force is distributed more evenly across the three separate hydrogen-bonded interfaces.\n\nB. The Greek key, because the polypeptide termini are located on strands that are spatially adjacent and hydrogen-bonded, placing these bonds directly in the line of force.\n\nC. The $\\beta$-meander, because the longer polypeptide loops connecting the non-adjacent strands absorb more strain, protecting the hydrogen-bond network.\n\nD. The Greek key, because its topology necessitates breaking hydrogen bonds at two separate interfaces (between strands 4-1 and 2-3) simultaneously to cause separation.\n\nE. Both motifs have equal mechanical resistance because they are composed of the same number of strands and have approximately the same total number of hydrogen bonds.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of two four-stranded antiparallel $\\beta$-sheet motifs, a $\\beta$-meander or a Greek key, has greater mechanical resistance when pulled by its termini. The resistance is related to the number of hydrogen bonds that must be broken simultaneously.\n\nLet's analyze the topology and the effect of the applied force for each motif. The force is applied to the N-terminus of strand 1 and the C-terminus of strand 4 in both cases.\n\n**1. Analysis of the $\\beta$-Meander Motif:**\n- **Topology:** The strands are arranged sequentially in space: 1-2-3-4.\n- **Connectivity:** The polypeptide chain runs from strand 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4.\n- **Hydrogen Bonding:** Strands 1 and 2 are H-bonded. Strands 2 and 3 are H-bonded. Strands 3 and 4 are H-bonded.\n- **Force Application:** The pulling force is applied at the beginning of strand 1 and the end of strand 4. These two strands are at opposite ends of the sheet and are not hydrogen-bonded to each other.\n- **Force Propagation and Unfolding:** The tensile force is transmitted through the covalent backbone of the polypeptide chain: through strand 1, the turn to strand 2, strand 2, the turn to strand 3, strand 3, the turn to strand 4, and finally strand 4. The force acts to pull the entire chain straight. This puts stress on the turns and can lead to an \"unzipping\" or \"shear\" mechanism. For instance, the hydrogen bonds holding the sheet together (e.g., between strands 2 and 3) are not directly in the primary line of force between the two termini. The structure can be peeled apart more easily because the force is not directly opposing a large bank of hydrogen bonds in parallel. This is a \"series\" loading configuration for the H-bond interfaces.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Greek Key Motif:**\n- **Topology:** The strands are arranged in space as 4-1-2-3.\n- **Connectivity:** The polypeptide chain connects the strands in the order 1-2-3-4.\n- **Hydrogen Bonding:** Strand 4 is H-bonded to strand 1. Strand 1 is H-bonded to strand 2. Strand 2 is H-bonded to strand 3.\n- **Force Application:** The pulling force is applied at the N-terminus of strand 1 and the C-terminus of strand 4.\n- **Force Propagation and Unfolding:** Critically, in the Greek key's spatial arrangement (4-1-2-3), the strands being pulled (1 and 4) are physically adjacent and directly hydrogen-bonded to each other. The applied tensile force therefore acts directly across the interface between strand 1 and strand 4. To pull the N-terminus of strand 1 away from the C-terminus of strand 4, all the hydrogen bonds connecting these two strands must be broken simultaneously. This constitutes a \"parallel\" loading of these specific hydrogen bonds. Breaking many bonds at once requires a significantly higher peak force than breaking them one by one (unzipping) or shearing an interface not directly held by the termini.\n\n**3. Comparison and Conclusion:**\n- In the $\\beta$-meander, the force is transmitted along the backbone, and the hydrogen bonds are loaded in a way that allows for sequential failure (unzipping or shear). The pulling points are far apart in the hydrogen-bonding network.\n- In the Greek key, the pulling points (on strands 1 and 4) are on spatially adjacent strands, placing the hydrogen bonds between them directly in the line of force. These bonds are loaded in parallel and must fail simultaneously, leading to high mechanical resistance.\n- Therefore, the Greek key motif is mechanically more resistant to this specific mode of pulling.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n- A. Incorrect. The force is not distributed evenly; the meander topology is weaker against this type of force.\n- B. Correct. This accurately describes the situation in the Greek key. The termini are on adjacent strands (1 and 4), placing the H-bonds between them directly in the line of force, acting as a parallel set of interactions that must be broken at once.\n- C. Incorrect. While loops can have complex mechanical properties, the primary reason for the meander's lower resistance is the force pathway, not strain absorption in the loops.\n- D. Incorrect. This MISINTERPRETS the failure mechanism. The primary resistance in the Greek key comes from the interface that is directly stressed by the pulling force (the 4-1 interface), not from the need to break multiple interfaces simultaneously. The force is concentrated on one key interface.\n- E. Incorrect. This ignores the crucial role of topology in determining how forces are distributed across the non-covalent interactions. The total number of bonds is not the sole determinant of mechanical strength; their arrangement is key.\n\nThe correct choice is B, as it correctly identifies the stronger motif and the correct topological reason for its enhanced stability under tensile load.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2140395"}, {"introduction": "The deepest level of understanding comes from the ability to design and build. This advanced problem puts you in the role of a protein engineer with a specific goal: to force a polypeptide chain to adopt a Greek key fold.

In its native state, this polypeptide folds into a simple β-meander, where the strands are arranged sequentially in the sheet, resulting in a strand order of S1-S2-S3-S4 with H-bonds between adjacent pairs (S1-S2, S2-S3, S3-S4).\n\nYour goal is to re-engineer this protein to force it to adopt a specific Greek key topology.

One cysteine in strand S1 and one in strand S3.", "solution": "The problem asks for the optimal placement of a disulfide bond to convert a four-stranded β-meander into a specific Greek key motif. This requires analyzing the topological differences between the two folds and determining which covalent constraint would most effectively favor the target structure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial and target topologies.**\n\nThe initial fold is a β-meander with a strand order of S1-S2-S3-S4 in the sheet. The chain connectivity is N-S1-L1-S2-L2-S3-L3-S4-C. In a meander, strands that are adjacent in sequence are also adjacent in the 3D structure. The loops L1, L2, and L3 are simple hairpin turns connecting adjacent strands. The strands S1 and S4 are at opposite ends of the sheet and are far apart.\n\nThe target fold is a Greek key with a strand order of S4-S1-S2-S3 in the sheet. The chain connectivity remains N-S1-L1-S2-L2-S3-L3-S4-C. Let's trace the path of the polypeptide chain to form this structure:\n- S1 is connected to S2 by loop L1. In the S4-S1-S2-S3 sheet, S1 and S2 are adjacent. Therefore, L1 is a short hairpin turn.\n- S2 is connected to S3 by loop L2. In the sheet, S2 and S3 are adjacent. Therefore, L2 is also a short hairpin turn.\n- S3 is connected to S4 by loop L3. In the sheet, S3 and S4 are at opposite ends, separated by S1 and S2. For S3 to connect to S4, the loop L3 must be a long connection that traverses across the top or bottom of the sheet, spanning the width of the S1-S2 pair.\n- The defining, non-local feature of this specific Greek key is that the first strand in the sequence (S1) is hydrogen-bonded to the last strand in the sequence (S4).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the engineering principle.**\n\nThe disulfide bond must introduce a covalent constraint that is satisfied in the target Greek key structure but is highly unfavorable or impossible to satisfy in the initial β-meander structure. By forming early in the folding process, this bond will bias the folding landscape, making the Greek key conformation energetically much more favorable than the meander. The most effective constraint will be one that directly enforces a key long-range interaction specific to the target fold.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the proposed placement strategies.**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the principle above:\n\n*   **A. One cysteine in strand S1 and one in strand S2:** This disulfide bond would lock the S1-S2 hairpin. This hairpin exists in *both* the meander and the target Greek key. Therefore, this constraint does not provide any specific bias to favor the Greek key over the meander. It simply stabilizes a local structural element common to both.\n\n*   **B. One cysteine in loop L1 and one in loop L3:** In the target S4-S1-S2-S3 Greek key, L1 is a short hairpin between S1 and S2, while L3 is the long crossover loop connecting S3 to S4. These two loops are located on opposite sides of the β-sheet. Bringing them together to form a disulfide bond would be sterically difficult and is inconsistent with the target topology. This placement would likely prevent the formation of the desired Greek key.\n\n*   **C. One cysteine in strand S2 and one in strand S4:** In the target S4-S1-S2-S3 sheet, S2 and S4 are not adjacent. They are separated by strand S1. Placing a disulfide bond between them would force an unnatural and strained conformation, which is incompatible with the target fold.\n\n*   **D. One cysteine in strand S1 and one in strand S4:** This strategy places a covalent link between the first and the last strands of the four-strand motif.\n    - In the initial β-meander, S1 and S4 are at opposite ends of the sheet and are spatially distant. Forming a disulfide bond between them would require a massive, energetically costly distortion of the meander fold, effectively preventing its formation.\n    - In the target S4-S1-S2-S3 Greek key, S1 and S4 are adjacent and form the central hydrogen-bonding interface of the sheet. Placing a disulfide bond between the interacting faces of S1 and S4 would directly and strongly stabilize this defining non-local interaction.\n    - Therefore, this constraint perfectly satisfies our engineering principle: it destabilizes the default fold while stabilizing the target fold. It forces the N-terminal and C-terminal strands of the motif to associate, which is the quintessential event in forming this type of Greek key.\n\n*   **E. One cysteine in strand S1 and one in strand S3:** In the target S4-S1-S2-S3 sheet, S1 and S3 are not adjacent; they are separated by S2. A disulfide bond between S1 and S3 would be incompatible with the hydrogen bonding pattern of the target structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most strategic and effective placement is to introduce the cysteine residues in strand S1 and strand S4. This creates a powerful topological constraint that prevents the formation of the default meander and directly promotes the key long-range interaction required for the formation of the desired S4-S1-S2-S3 Greek key motif.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2143035"}]}
