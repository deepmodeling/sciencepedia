Silk fibroin from spiders and silkworms contains repetitive motifs such as Gly-Ala and Gly-Ser that assemble into extended β-strands which stack as antiparallel β-sheets. The small side chains of glycine and alanine (and serine, which is only slightly larger) enable tight intersheet packing, maximizing van der Waals contacts, while the primary stabilization within each sheet is via backbone hydrogen bonding between neighboring β-strands. The crystalline β-sheet domains formed by these small residues confer high tensile strength and characteristic fibrous properties.\n\nBy contrast, α-keratin is a coiled-coil protein composed of right-handed α-helices that wrap into left-handed coiled coils. Its sequence is characterized by a heptad repeat (positions a–g) in which hydrophobic residues, especially larger ones such as leucine, isoleucine, or valine, occupy the a and d positions to drive coiled-coil packing; hard keratins also feature cysteines for disulfide crosslinking. α-keratin is not defined by a high abundance of glycine and alanine repeats, and glycine has low helix propensity and is not required for “tight turns” in α-helices. Therefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because α-keratin’s heptad repeat is not specifically enriched in glycine and alanine to promote helical packing; larger hydrophobics dominate the core.\n- Option C is incorrect because α-helices do not require tight turns stabilized by glycine; glycine often destabilizes helices.\n- Option D misattributes the key stabilization in silk to extensive side-chain hydrogen bonding via serine; the principal stabilizing interactions in silk β-sheets are backbone hydrogen bonds, with small side chains enabling close packing; although serine can form some side-chain hydrogen bonds, this is not the defining structural reason.\n\nThus, the peptide most likely derives from silk fibroin, with structural reasoning based on small-side-chain-driven close packing of antiparallel β-sheets.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2111382"}, {"introduction": "While silk fibroin relies on stacked $\\beta$-sheets, $\\alpha$-keratin achieves its strength through the elegant architecture of the coiled-coil.

A stable coiled-coil requires specific types of amino acids at key positions.\n\n**Guiding Principles:**\n1.  **Positions $a$ and $d$ (Hydrophobic Core):** These positions (1, 4, 8, 11 in a 14-residue sequence) must be occupied by nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Ala, Phe). These residues pack together to form a \"hydrophobic seam\" that drives the association of the helices.\n2.  **Positions $e$ and $g$ (Electrostatic Interactions):** These positions (5, 7, 12, 14) are often occupied by charged amino acids (e.g., Lys, Arg, His, Glu, Asp). They can form stabilizing salt bridges between the two helices. For a parallel coiled-coil, a salt bridge can form between a residue at position $e$ on one helix and a residue at position $g$ on the adjacent helix.\n3.  **Positions $b, c, f$ (Solvent-Exposed):** These positions (2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 13) are exposed to the solvent and are typically polar or charged, contributing to the solubility of the protein complex.\n4.  **Helix Breakers:** Proline (Pro) is known as a \"helix breaker\" because its rigid cyclic structure disrupts the regular hydrogen bonding pattern of an α-helix. Glycine (Gly) can also be destabilizing due to its high conformational flexibility, which can introduce kinks or breaks in the helical structure if present in high numbers.\n\nLet's analyze each option by mapping the residues to the heptad positions:\n\n**Sequence Positions:**\n`1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14`\n`a-b-c-d-e-f-g-a'-b'-c'-d'-e'-f'-g'`\n\n**A. Met-Ser-Gln-Leu-Glu-Ala-Lys-Val-Asn-Thr-Ile-Arg-Phe-Asp**\n-   **Positions $a, d$ (1, 4, 8, 11):** Met, Leu, Val, Ile. All are classic nonpolar, hydrophobic residues appropriate for the core.\n-   **Positions $e, g$ (5, 7, 12, 14):** Glu, Lys, Arg, Asp. All are charged residues. They can form potential salt bridges (e.g., Glu-Lys, Arg-Asp) with a partner helix, which would strongly stabilize the coiled-coil.\n-   **Positions $b, c, f$ (2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 13):** Ser, Gln, Ala, Asn, Thr, Phe. These are a mix of polar, nonpolar, and aromatic residues suitable for solvent-exposed positions. This sequence is a textbook example of a stable coiled-coil repeat.\n\n**B. Lys-Ser-Gln-Arg-Glu-Ala-Lys-Asp-Asn-Thr-Glu-Arg-Phe-Asp**\n-   **Positions $a, d$ (1, 4, 8, 11):** Lys, Arg, Asp, Glu. These are all charged residues. Placing charged residues in the hydrophobic core is highly unfavorable due to electrostatic repulsion and the energetic cost of desolvating charges. This would prevent the formation of a stable hydrophobic core. This sequence is unlikely to form a coiled-coil.\n\n**C. Met-Ser-Gln-Leu-Pro-Ala-Lys-Val-Asn-Thr-Ile-Arg-Phe-Asp**\n-   **Position $e$ (5):** Proline (Pro). Proline is a helix breaker. Its presence within a potential α-helical segment, especially in a short peptide, would severely disrupt the helical structure required for the coiled-coil. This sequence would not form a stable α-helix, and therefore cannot form a stable coiled-coil.\n\n**D. Met-Ser-Gln-Leu-Ile-Ala-Trp-Val-Asn-Thr-Val-Phe-Phe-Leu**\n-   **Positions $a, d$ (1, 4, 8, 11):** Met, Leu, Val, Val. These are good hydrophobic core residues.\n-   **Positions $e, g$ (5, 7, 12, 14):** Ile, Trp, Phe, Leu. These are all large, nonpolar, hydrophobic residues. While the hydrophobic core ($a,d$) is appropriate, placing these large hydrophobic residues at positions $e$ and $g$ would create a large, contiguous hydrophobic patch on the protein surface. This could lead to aggregation rather than the specific formation of a dimer. More importantly, it lacks the potential for stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) that are characteristic of many stable coiled-coils.\n\n**E.

While it can be found in coiled-coils, having it populate all the core positions is destabilizing. The lack of bulky side chains would lead to poor packing in the hydrophobic core, and the high flexibility would work against the formation of a rigid, stable helical structure. A poly-glycine sequence is known to favor other secondary structures or random coils over α-helices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy comparing the five options against the principles of coiled-coil formation, sequence A is the only one that places appropriate hydrophobic residues at the core positions ($a, d$) and charged residues at the flanking positions ($e, g$) to enable stabilizing electrostatic interactions, without introducing any helix-breaking residues.

Its remarkable strength and flexibility are derived from its higher-order structure, which consists of extended polypeptide chains in an antiparallel β-sheet conformation. These sheets are stacked in layers. The primary sequence of silk fibroin is characterized by a highly repetitive pattern, predominantly composed of the amino acid sequence $(Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala)_n$. The small side chains of glycine (a hydrogen atom) and alanine (a methyl group) are crucial for allowing the β-sheets to pack together in a very dense, crystalline-like arrangement.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a genetic engineering experiment results in a modified silkworm that produces fibroin in which 50% of the glycine residues in the repetitive regions are systematically replaced with valine residues. Valine is an amino acid with a bulky, nonpolar side chain.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary structural consequence of this substitution on the higher-order arrangement of the fibroin protein?\n\nA. The bulky side chains of valine will cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the close packing of β-sheets and leading to a more disordered, amorphous structure.\n\nB. The hydrophobic nature of the valine side chains will enhance the hydrophobic interactions between the β-sheets, leading to a more stable and tightly packed structure.\n\nC. The presence of valine will disrupt the β-sheet tendency of the polypeptide chain, causing the modified segments to refold into α-helices.\n\nD. The substitution will have no significant effect on the overall structure because both glycine and valine are amino acids with nonpolar side chains.\n\nE. The valine residues will facilitate the formation of new covalent cross-links between the β-sheets, resulting in a much more rigid and brittle fiber.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the structural impact of replacing a significant number of glycine residues with valine residues in silk fibroin. To do this, we must compare the properties of glycine and valine and understand their roles in the native fibroin structure.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the native structure of silk fibroin.\nThe key structural feature of silk fibroin is the stacking of antiparallel β-sheets. The mechanical properties of silk depend on this highly ordered, quasi-crystalline arrangement. This arrangement is possible because of the specific amino acid composition. The primary sequence is rich in glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), and serine (Ser), which have the three smallest side chains among the common amino acids.\n\nStep 2: Understand the specific role of glycine.\nGlycine is unique among the 20 common amino acids because its side chain is just a single hydrogen atom. This minimal size is the critical factor that allows the β-sheets in fibroin to pack together with extraordinary tightness. The side chains from one sheet fit neatly into the spaces between the side chains of the adjacent sheet, a concept often described as \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. Glycine's small size minimizes steric repulsion between the stacked sheets, permitting a very small inter-sheet distance and maximizing stabilizing van der Waals interactions.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the properties of the substituting amino acid, valine.\nValine has a side chain group of $\\text{-CH(CH}_3\\text{)}_2$. This isopropyl group is nonpolar, but more importantly, it is much larger and bulkier than glycine's hydrogen atom.\n\nStep 4: Predict the effect of the Glycine to Valine substitution.\nWhen a glycine residue is replaced by a valine residue, the small hydrogen atom side chain is swapped for the large, branched isopropyl group. This bulky group will protrude from the β-sheet. When two such modified sheets attempt to stack, the valine side chains from one sheet will physically clash with the side chains of the opposing sheet. This is known as steric hindrance or steric repulsion. This clash will prevent the sheets from achieving the close, tight packing characteristic of native fibroin. The well-ordered, crystalline lattice will be disrupted.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n\nOption A: \"The bulky side chains of valine will cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the close packing of β-sheets and leading to a more disordered, amorphous structure.\" This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The steric clash from the bulky valine side chains is the dominant effect, which would disrupt the ordered packing and lead to a less structured, or amorphous, protein arrangement. This is the most likely outcome.\n\nOption B: \"The hydrophobic nature of the valine side chains will enhance the hydrophobic interactions between the β-sheets, leading to a more stable and tightly packed structure.\" This is incorrect. While valine is indeed hydrophobic, the stabilization from hydrophobic interactions requires the nonpolar groups to be in close proximity. The steric repulsion caused by the sheer size of the valine side chain would prevent the sheets from getting close enough for these interactions to be effective or to overcome the repulsive forces. Steric clash is the overriding factor here.\n\nOption C: \"The presence of valine will disrupt the β-sheet tendency of the polypeptide chain, causing the modified segments to refold into α-helices.\" While different amino acids have different propensities for forming α-helices or β-sheets, valine, being a β-branched amino acid, actually has a relatively high propensity to be in β-sheets. More importantly, the overall $(Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala)_n$ pattern strongly favors a β-sheet conformation. A few substitutions are highly unlikely to cause a complete secondary structure transition from a β-sheet to an α-helix. The primary effect will be on the *packing* of the sheets (tertiary/quaternary structure), not the secondary structure of the chain itself.\n\nOption D: \"The substitution will have no significant effect on the overall structure because both glycine and valine are amino acids with nonpolar side chains.\" This is incorrect because it ignores the critical role of side chain size and shape (sterics) in protein packing. While polarity is an important property, in the context of the densely packed fibroin structure, the physical volume occupied by the side chain is paramount.\n\nOption E: \"The valine residues will facilitate the formation of new covalent cross-links between the β-sheets, resulting in a much more rigid and brittle fiber.\" This is fundamentally incorrect. Covalent disulfide cross-links are formed by the amino acid cysteine, which contains a sulfhydryl (-SH) group. Valine does not have a side chain capable of forming covalent cross-links.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate prediction is that the steric hindrance from the bulky valine side chains will disrupt the tight packing of the β-sheets, leading to a disordered structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2111342"}]}
