The stability of a β-hairpin is influenced by the amino acid composition of both the strands and the turn.\n\n- **β-strands**: These are typically rich in bulky hydrophobic amino acids (such as Valine, Isoleucine, Leucine) and aromatic amino acids (Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Tryptophan). In an isolated hairpin, side chains from the two strands can interact. For antiparallel strands, the side chains of adjacent residues point in opposite directions. A stable hairpin is often formed when hydrophobic residues are positioned on the interacting faces of the two strands, allowing them to pack together and form a stabilizing hydrophobic core.\n\n- **β-turns**: These favor amino acids that can adopt the necessary backbone dihedral angles for a sharp reversal of the polypeptide chain. Glycine is favored due to its small size and conformational flexibility, and Proline is favored because its rigid, cyclic structure pre-organizes the backbone for a turn. Asparagine and Aspartic acid are also commonly found in turns.\n\nConsider a 10-residue peptide.

In an antiparallel register, interacting residue pairs are (1,10), (2,9), (3,8), and (4,7). Hydrophobic pairs among these support a stabilizing hydrophobic core via the hydrophobic effect.\n\n2) Two-residue β-turns favor residues that accommodate tight backbone dihedral angles: proline (pre-organizes the backbone; restricted $ \\phi $) and glycine (high conformational flexibility) are classic and frequently observed; asparagine and aspartic acid are also commonly found.

Experimental evidence states that residues 5 and 6 form the turn of a stable antiparallel β-hairpin, connecting two adjacent β-strands. Therefore, residues 1–4 form one strand and residues 7–10 form the opposing strand, with residue 4 adjacent to the turn on the N-terminal strand and residue 7 adjacent to the turn on the C-terminal strand.\n\nIn an antiparallel β-sheet, the canonical hydrogen bonding pattern aligns residue pairs across the strands such that residue 4 pairs with residue 7 (closest to the turn), residue 3 with residue 8, residue 2 with residue 9, and residue 1 with residue 10. For each aligned pair in an antiparallel sheet, there are two backbone hydrogen bonds: one from the carbonyl oxygen of one residue to the amide nitrogen of the opposite residue, and the reciprocal one from the carbonyl oxygen of the opposite residue to the amide nitrogen of the first. Thus, for the pair closest to the turn, residues 4 and 7, the two possible hydrogen bonds are between the carbonyl oxygen of residue 4 and the amide nitrogen of residue 7, and between the carbonyl oxygen of residue 7 and the amide nitrogen of residue 4.\n\nTo determine which hydrogen bond is “closest to the turn,” we examine the positions of the backbone atoms relative to the turn. In the peptide backbone, the carbonyl group of residue 4 is adjacent to residue 5 (entering the turn), so the carbonyl oxygen of residue 4 is the atom on residue 4 that lies closest to the turn. On residue 7, the amide nitrogen is bonded to the carbonyl of residue 6 (exiting the turn), so the amide nitrogen of residue 7 is the atom on residue 7 that lies closest to the turn.

Options C and D correspond to the next pair away from the turn (residues 3 and 8), and option E involves atoms within the turn (residues 5 and 6) rather than a cross-strand hydrogen bond. Option B describes the reciprocal bond for the 4–7 pair but involves the atoms on each residue that are farther from the turn (amide nitrogen of residue 4 and carbonyl oxygen of residue 7), so it is not the one “closest to the turn.”", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2147317"}, {"introduction": "The stability of a folded protein is not just about forming favorable interactions, but also about avoiding unfavorable ones, such as exposing nonpolar groups to water. The hydrophobic effect, which drives the burial of nonpolar side chains into a protein's core, is a dominant force in protein folding. This thought experiment probes your understanding of this principle by asking you to predict the structural fate of a β-hairpin when its hydrophobic core is disrupted by a mutation, highlighting the critical role of hydrophobic packing in maintaining structural integrity [@problem_id:2147288].", "problem": "A small, engineered protein named \"Stabilitin-B\" is designed to be exceptionally stable in a neutral pH aqueous solution. Its structure is dominated by a single, well-defined β-hairpin motif. This motif consists of two antiparallel β-strands connected by a short loop. The stability of this hairpin is critically dependent on the formation of a hydrophobic core between the two strands, where nonpolar side chains are sequestered away from the surrounding water.\n\nOne of the β-strands has a sequence where the side chains of alternating residues point into this hydrophobic core. Let's consider a specific residue, Leucine at position 12 (Leu12), whose bulky, nonpolar side chain is buried deep within this core, making crucial van der Waals contacts with other hydrophobic residues.\n\nA researcher creates a mutant version of Stabilitin-B by replacing Leu12 with an Aspartate residue (a mutation denoted as L12D).

The β-hairpin will become significantly more stable due to the formation of new, favorable electrostatic interactions with the polar solvent.\n\nB. The mutation will have a negligible effect on the hairpin's stability, as the backbone hydrogen bonds are the dominant stabilizing force in β-sheets.\n\nC. The β-hairpin will unfold or be severely destabilized as the introduction of a charged group into the hydrophobic core is energetically highly unfavorable.\n\nD. The entire β-hairpin motif will refold into a more compact α-helix, which can better accommodate the charged side chain.\n\nE. The two β-strands will be pushed further apart to create a larger, water-filled cavity around the new aspartate residue, weakening but not destroying the hairpin.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the structural consequence of mutating a hydrophobic residue (Leucine, Leu) inside the hydrophobic core of a β-hairpin to a charged residue (Aspartate, Asp). To solve this, we must analyze the forces that stabilize the original β-hairpin and then evaluate the energetic impact of the mutation.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the stabilizing forces of the wild-type β-hairpin.\nThe stability of folded protein structures like the β-hairpin in an aqueous environment is governed by a balance of several interactions.\n- **Backbone Hydrogen Bonds:** The two antiparallel β-strands are held together by a network of hydrogen bonds between the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms and amide hydrogen atoms of opposing strands. This is a key feature of all β-sheet structures.\n- **The Hydrophobic Effect:** This is a primary driving force for protein folding. Nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acid side chains, like that of Leucine, are energetically unfavorable to expose to polar water molecules. To minimize this unfavorable interaction, the protein folds in a way that sequesters these hydrophobic side chains into a nonpolar core, away from the solvent. The Leu12 residue is described as being deep within this core, indicating its important role in the hairpin's stability through the hydrophobic effect.\n- **Van der Waals Interactions:** Within the tightly packed hydrophobic core, residues like Leu12 make numerous, close-range van der Waals contacts with other nonpolar residues, which collectively contribute significantly to the stability.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the properties of the mutation.\nThe mutation is L12D, which replaces Leucine with Aspartate at position 12.\n- **Leucine (Leu):** Has a nonpolar, aliphatic side chain $ \\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH(CH}_3)_2 $. It is hydrophobic and well-suited for the protein interior.\n- **Aspartate (Asp):** Has an acidic side chain $ \\text{-CH}_2\\text{COOH} $. At neutral pH (as specified in the problem), this carboxylic acid group is deprotonated to a carboxylate ion $ \\text{-CH}_2\\text{COO}^- $. This side chain is therefore hydrophilic and carries a negative charge.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the energetic consequence of placing Aspartate in the hydrophobic core.\nThe central conflict arises from placing the charged Asp12 side chain into the nonpolar environment of the hydrophobic core.\n- **Desolvation Penalty:** A charged group like the carboxylate of Asp is highly stabilized by interactions with polar water molecules (ion-dipole interactions). Removing it from water and placing it in a nonpolar environment, where such favorable interactions are absent, incurs a very large energetic cost. This is known as the desolvation penalty. The hydrophobic core is, by definition, a region that excludes water.\n- **Energetic Disruption:** The energetic penalty for burying a single charge in a hydrophobic environment is substantial, often on the order of many tens of kJ/mol. This destabilizing energy is typically much larger than the stabilizing energy provided by a few hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts. The strong repulsion between the charged group and its nonpolar surroundings will overwhelm the forces holding the hairpin in its native conformation.\n\nStep 4: Determine the most likely structural outcome and evaluate the given options.\nThe protein will seek to minimize its overall free energy. Due to the massive energetic penalty of the buried charge, the most favorable action is for the protein to change its conformation to expose the new Asp12 side chain to the aqueous solvent. This process necessarily requires the disruption of the original β-hairpin structure.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this analysis:\n- **A:** This is incorrect. While the Asp side chain *itself* would be more stable in the solvent, the option claims the *hairpin structure* becomes more stable. The mutation destabilizes the folded hairpin by forcing a charge into its core.\n- **B:** This is incorrect. While backbone hydrogen bonds are essential, the hydrophobic effect is a dominant force in the overall stability of tertiary and supersecondary structures. The energetic cost of a buried charge is far from negligible and can easily be sufficient to disrupt the structure, despite the presence of hydrogen bonds.\n- **C:** This is correct. The large energetic penalty associated with burying the Asp12 charge in the hydrophobic core will disrupt the stabilizing interactions. This leads to a loss of the defined structure, which is best described as unfolding or severe destabilization of the β-hairpin motif.\n- **D:** This is incorrect. While proteins can have different secondary structures, a single point mutation is highly unlikely to trigger a clean, cooperative refolding from a β-sheet into an α-helix. The local sequence and interactions do not favor such a specific, dramatic transformation. General unfolding is a much more probable result of such a destabilizing mutation.\n- **E:** This is incorrect. Pushing the strands apart to let a single water molecule in to solvate the charge would disrupt the precise packing of the hydrophobic core and the optimal geometry of the inter-strand hydrogen bonds. This represents a significant destabilization, and \"unfold or be severely destabilized\" (Option C) is a more accurate and comprehensive description of such a catastrophic structural failure. The core principle of the hairpin's structure is violated.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of a charged residue into the hydrophobic core is a classic method for destabilizing a protein fold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2147288"}]}
