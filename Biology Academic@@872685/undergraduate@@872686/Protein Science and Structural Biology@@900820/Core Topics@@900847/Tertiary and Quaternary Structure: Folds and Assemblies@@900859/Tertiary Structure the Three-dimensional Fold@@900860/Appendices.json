This exercise challenges you to interpret CD spectral data to deduce the dominant structural elements within a protein and how they respond to denaturation [@problem_id:2141109].", "problem": "A biochemist isolates a novel, soluble protein, which they name \"Glaciaprotectin,\" from a bacterium living in a subglacial lake. To investigate its three-dimensional structure, the biochemist employs Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, a technique that measures the differential absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light by chiral molecules. For proteins, the CD spectrum in the far-ultraviolet region (190 nm to 250 nm) is particularly sensitive to the backbone conformation and is commonly used to estimate the content of different secondary structures.\n\nThe initial experiment on Glaciaprotectin in a physiological buffer solution yields a CD spectrum characterized by a single, strong negative band with a minimum at 218 nm.\n\nIn a second experiment, a high concentration of the chemical denaturant guanidinium chloride is added to the protein solution. A denaturant is a substance that disrupts the weak non-covalent interactions responsible for maintaining a protein's folded structure. The CD spectrum of this new sample is measured, and the result is markedly different: the strong negative band at 218 nm has vanished, and a new, intense negative band is now observed with a minimum near 198 nm.\n\nBased on these two experimental results, what is the most credible conclusion about the secondary structure of Glaciaprotectin in its native, folded state and its response to the denaturant?\n\nA. The native protein is rich in $\\alpha$-helices, and the denaturant causes these helices to convert into $\\beta$-sheets.\n\nB. The native protein has no defined secondary structure (it is a random coil), and the denaturant induces the formation of $\\beta$-sheets.\n\nC. The native protein is rich in $\\beta$-sheets, and the denaturant causes the protein to unfold into a random coil.\n\nD. The native protein is rich in $\\alpha$-helices, and the denaturant causes the protein to unfold into a random coil.\n\nE. The native protein is rich in $\\beta$-sheets, and the denaturant causes these sheets to convert into $\\alpha$-helices.", "solution": "Circular dichroism (CD) measures the difference in absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light by a chiral sample. The basic observable is the differential molar extinction coefficient $\\Delta\\varepsilon(\\lambda)=\\varepsilon_{L}(\\lambda)-\\varepsilon_{R}(\\lambda)$, which, in the far-UV region for proteins, arises from the amide chromophore of the peptide backbone. Characteristic secondary structures have well-established far-UV CD signatures due to exciton coupling among peptide bonds: \n- $\\alpha$-helices exhibit two strong negative bands near 208 nm and 222 nm and a positive band near 190 nm. \n- $\\beta$-sheets exhibit a strong negative band near 215–218 nm and a positive band near approximately 195 nm. \n- Random coil (disordered) conformations exhibit a single intense negative band near 195–200 nm, typically around 198 nm, with diminished longer-wavelength features.\n\nInterpreting the native spectrum: the initial spectrum has a single, strong negative band with a minimum at 218 nm. This aligns with the canonical $\\beta$-sheet signature (negative band near 215–218 nm) and does not match the double-minimum pattern of $\\alpha$-helix. Therefore, in its native, folded state, Glaciaprotectin is rich in $\\beta$-sheet structure.\n\nInterpreting the denaturant spectrum: upon addition of guanidinium chloride, the 218 nm negative band disappears and is replaced by a strong negative band near 198 nm. A dominant negative band near 198 nm is the hallmark of an unfolded, random coil ensemble. Denaturants disrupt non-covalent interactions stabilizing tertiary and secondary structure, leading to unfolding; the observed shift is thus consistent with denaturation to a random coil.\n\nMapping to the options: the native $\\beta$-sheet signature at 218 nm transitioning to a random coil signature near 198 nm corresponds to the statement that the native protein is rich in $\\beta$-sheets and the denaturant causes unfolding into a random coil.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2141109"}, {"introduction": "The final three-dimensional fold of a protein is exquisitely sensitive to the properties of its constituent amino acids, especially for residues located in turns and loops that guide the polypeptide chain's path. This practice asks you to predict the structural and stability consequences of replacing a rigid proline residue with a flexible glycine in a critical turn. By doing so, you will see how local conformational preferences encoded in the primary sequence dictate global protein architecture and stability [@problem_id:2141130].", "problem": "Researchers are studying a newly discovered enzyme, thermolysin-Z, isolated from a thermophilic bacterium. The enzyme exhibits high thermal stability, functioning optimally at 85 °C. Through crystallographic analysis, they determine that a critical beta-turn connects two major antiparallel beta-sheets that form the core of the enzyme's active site. This turn contains a proline residue that is highly conserved across related enzymes. To probe the importance of this residue, a site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed, creating a variant of thermolysin-Z where this specific proline is replaced by a glycine residue.\n\nBased on the principles of protein structure, what is the most probable consequence of this proline-to-glycine mutation on the tertiary structure and stability of thermolysin-Z?\n\nA. The mutation will have a negligible effect on the protein's structure and stability, as both proline and glycine are small amino acids commonly found in turns.\n\nB. The mutation will introduce steric hindrance in the turn, pushing the beta-sheets apart and increasing the overall size of the protein without affecting its stability.\n\nC. The mutation will increase the rigidity of the turn, leading to a more compact and even more thermally stable protein structure.\n\nD. The mutation will increase the conformational flexibility of the turn, leading to a less defined structure in that region and a decrease in the overall thermal stability of the protein.\n\nE. The mutation will cause the glycine to form an incorrect covalent bond with a backbone amide group, permanently unfolding the protein.", "solution": "We use principles of protein structure and stability, focusing on the distinct conformational roles of proline and glycine in turns and loops.\n\n1) Proline’s structural role:\n- Proline has a cyclic side chain bonded to the backbone nitrogen, which restricts the backbone dihedral angle $\\phi$. This conformational restriction makes proline particularly favorable in turn regions, including $\\beta$-turns, because it can enforce the specific geometry required to reverse the chain direction.\n- By restricting backbone flexibility, proline reduces the conformational entropy of the unfolded state. This lowers the entropic penalty upon folding, thereby stabilizing the folded structure (i.e., it makes the folded state more favorable relative to the unfolded ensemble).\n- In many thermophilic proteins, proline residues in loops/turns contribute to thermal stability by rigidifying key structural elements that hold secondary structure elements in precise orientations.\n\n2) Glycine’s structural role:\n- Glycine lacks a side chain beyond hydrogen and therefore allows a wide range of $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ angles. This makes it the most conformationally flexible residue.\n- While glycine is frequently accommodated in turns, especially where tight backbone angles are required, its high flexibility generally increases local conformational entropy and can lead to less well-defined local structure if rigidity is essential at that position.\n\n3) Consequence of Pro $\\to$ Gly at a critical $\\beta$-turn connecting antiparallel $\\beta$-sheets in an active-site core:\n- Replacing a rigidity-imparting proline with a highly flexible glycine will increase local conformational freedom of the turn.\n- For a critical turn that positions two antiparallel $\\beta$-sheets forming the active site, increased flexibility is likely to reduce the precision of the turn’s geometry, leading to a less defined tertiary arrangement in that region.\n- Thermodynamic rationale: removing proline increases the entropy of the unfolded state, which makes the folded state relatively less favorable, decreasing thermal stability. In thermophilic enzymes, where tight packing and rigid turns underpin high-temperature stability, this effect is typically more pronounced.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect. Although both are small, their backbone effects are opposite; proline rigidifies while glycine greatly increases flexibility. Such a substitution at a critical turn is unlikely to be negligible.\n- B: Incorrect. Glycine is the smallest residue and does not introduce steric hindrance; it decreases, not increases, steric bulk.\n- C: Incorrect. Glycine decreases, not increases, rigidity relative to proline.\n- D: Correct. Increased conformational flexibility in the turn yields a less defined local structure and typically decreases overall thermal stability, especially in a thermophilic enzyme reliant on rigid turns.\n- E: Incorrect. Glycine’s side chain cannot form new covalent bonds with backbone amides beyond the standard peptide linkage; such a covalent misbonding scenario is not plausible.\n\nTherefore, the most probable consequence is increased flexibility of the turn, a less defined local structure, and reduced thermal stability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2141130"}, {"introduction": "A protein's function is determined by its specific three-dimensional structure, particularly the geometry and chemical nature of its active or binding sites.
