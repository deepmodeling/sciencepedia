The C-terminal region, covering residues 201-350, folds into a second, independent globular unit composed of a series of antiparallel $\\beta$-strands forming a well-defined $\\beta$-barrel.

Both systems classify protein structure primarily at the domain level, where a domain is an independently folding, compact unit that can be part of a single polypeptide chain. The presence of multiple domains within one continuous chain is common; therefore, the continuity of the polypeptide does not imply a single domain classification.\n\nNext, we clarify the major fold classes relevant to secondary structure composition:\n- In SCOP, the principal classes include all-$\\alpha$, all-$\\beta$, $\\alpha$/$\\beta$, and $\\alpha$+$\\beta$. The $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ class refers to domains where $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-strands are interleaved and often form repeating motifs (e.g., $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ barrels) with extensive $\\alpha$-$\\beta$ packing. The $\\alpha$+$\\beta$ class refers to domains where $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets are present but largely segregated rather than interleaved within a single domain.\n- In CATH, the Class level includes mainly-$\\alpha$, mainly-$\\beta$, $\\alpha$-$\\beta$, and few secondary structures, again applied at the domain level, and proteins can be multi-domain.\n\nWe analyze the structural description of Linkase:\n- Residues 1–150 form a compact all-$\\alpha$ globular unit. This is a domain by the independence and compactness criteria.\n- Residues 201–350 form a compact all-$\\beta$ globular unit (a $\\beta$-barrel), also an independent domain.\n- Residues 151–200 form a flexible, unstructured linker with minimal inter-domain contacts, supporting the identification of two distinct domains that function as separate structural and functional entities.\n\nTherefore, by SCOP and CATH principles, Linkase is a multi-domain protein composed of one all-$\\alpha$ domain and one all-$\\beta$ domain, connected by a linker. While one might colloquially describe the whole protein as an $\\alpha$+$\\beta$ protein because the entire chain contains both $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-strands, the precise and most informative classification in SCOP/CATH is at the domain level: one all-$\\alpha$ domain plus one all-$\\beta$ domain within a single polypeptide chain.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- Option A ($\\alpha$/$\\beta$) is incorrect because $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ refers to interleaved $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ elements within a single domain; Linkase has segregated domains, not an $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ domain architecture.\n- Option B is incorrect because a single continuous chain does not force a single-domain classification; SCOP/CATH routinely split such chains into domains.\n- Option C is incorrect because the presence of two domains does not prevent assignment to the major fold classes; moreover, this is not a quaternary assembly, as there is only one polypeptide chain.\n- Option D is correct: it acknowledges that the whole may be loosely termed $\\alpha$+$\\beta$ protein, but emphasizes the accurate SCOP/CATH view that Linkase is a multi-domain protein consisting of an all-$\\alpha$ domain and an all-$\\beta$ domain.\n- Option E is incorrect because domain distinctions are fundamental, not irrelevant, in SCOP/CATH classification.\n\nThus, the most accurate and insightful classification statement is Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2117836"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of protein architecture enables powerful applications in protein engineering, where structures are modified to create new functions.

A Triosephosphate Isomerase (TIM) barrel: This is a canonical $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ fold consisting of eight parallel $\\beta$-strands forming a central barrel, surrounded by eight $\\alpha$-helices. The connectivity is sequential, following a $(\\beta\\alpha)_8$ pattern, meaning the polypeptide chain goes from $\\beta$-strand 1 to $\\alpha$-helix 1, then to $\\beta$-strand 2, and so on, until $\\beta$-strand 8 and $\\alpha$-helix 8. The native N-terminus is at the start of $\\beta$-strand 1 and the C-terminus is at the end of $\\alpha$-helix 8, which are located close together in the final folded structure.\n\n2.  A 7-bladed $\\beta$-propeller: This is a classic all-$\\beta$ fold. It is composed of seven repeating structural units, or 'blades', arranged symmetrically around a central axis. Each blade is a small, four-stranded antiparallel $\\beta$-sheet. The structure exhibits a \"Velcro closure,\" where the first $\\beta$-strand of the N-terminal blade is contributed by the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain, locking the circular arrangement in place.\n\nImagine an experiment where a circular permutant is created for both a representative TIM barrel and a 7-bladed $\\beta$-propeller. In both cases, the native termini are successfully ligated, and the chain is cleaved in a solvent-exposed loop of similar length and flexibility located halfway through the polypeptide sequence.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome regarding the structural and functional viability of the resulting permutants?\n\nA. The TIM barrel permutant is more likely to be viable because the robust hydrophobic core formed by its central $\\beta$-barrel and surrounding $\\alpha$-helices is less sensitive to changes in chain connectivity than the more loosely packed $\\beta$-propeller domain.\n\nB. The $\\beta$-propeller permutant is more likely to be viable because its structure is composed of repeating, quasi-independent modules (blades), and its native termini are already interacting in a \"Velcro closure,\" making the structure inherently tolerant to relinking at a different position.\n\nC.

The $\\beta$-propeller permutant is more likely to be viable because all-$\\beta$ structures are inherently more rigid than $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ structures, preventing the permutant from unfolding upon cleavage of a surface loop.", "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate the likely success of creating a functional circular permutant from a TIM barrel versus a $\\beta$-propeller. This requires analyzing the topology and folding characteristics of each structural class.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the TIM Barrel ($\\alpha$/$\\beta$) Structure**\n\nA TIM barrel is a single, highly cooperative folding domain. Its structure is defined by the sequence $(\\beta\\alpha)_1 - (\\beta\\alpha)_2 - \\dots - (\\beta\\alpha)_8$. The polypeptide chain weaves back and forth, building the central $\\beta$-barrel and the outer ring of $\\alpha$-helices in a specific, sequential order. The stability of the entire structure, particularly the hydrophobic core of the barrel, depends on the correct formation and packing of all eight $\\beta$-strands and $\\alpha$-helices. The N-terminus (at $\\beta$1) and C-terminus (at $\\alpha$8) are indeed close in space, which facilitates ligation. However, the critical issue is the creation of new termini. By cleaving the chain in a loop in the middle of the sequence (e.g., in the loop between $\\beta$4 and $\\alpha$4), the new N- and C-termini will be ...-$\\beta$4 and $\\alpha$4-.... The original N-terminal half of the protein ($\\beta_1\\alpha_1$ to $\\beta_4$) must now fold correctly while being tethered to the original C-terminal half. The long-range interactions required to form the barrel (e.g., between $\\beta$1 and $\\beta$8) are now disrupted from a sequence-local perspective. The folding pathway, which relies on the sequential deposition of secondary structure elements, is likely to be severely hindered. The high cooperativity of the fold means that a disruption at one point can easily prevent the entire structure from forming correctly. Therefore, circular permutation of a TIM barrel is generally difficult and often results in a misfolded or non-functional protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 7-Bladed $\\beta$-Propeller (all-$\\beta$) Structure**\n\nA $\\beta$-propeller is fundamentally different. It is composed of a series of repeating, structurally homologous modules (the blades). Each blade can be considered a small, semi-independent folding unit. The overall structure is stabilized by the packing of these blades against each other and the central cavity. A key feature is the \"Velcro closure,\" where a $\\beta$-strand from the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain completes the $\\beta$-sheet of the first blade, which is formed by the N-terminal part of the sequence. This means the native termini are not just close; they are already part of an essential, interacting structural motif. This makes ligating them a natural extension of the protein's native structure.\n\nWhen new termini are created by cleaving a loop between two blades (e.g., between blade 3 and blade 4), the disruption is localized. The new N- and C-termini are in a region that connects two quasi-independent modules. The folding of the individual blades is less likely to be affected, and as long as the blades themselves are stable, they can still assemble into the overall propeller architecture. The modular and symmetric nature of the propeller makes it much more tolerant to this kind of rearrangement. The folding process is not as strictly sequential and cooperative over the entire length of the polypeptide as it is for the TIM barrel.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Two Cases and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the $\\beta$-propeller's modular, repetitive structure and its native Velcro closure make it a much better candidate for successful circular permutation than the highly integrated, sequentially-dependent TIM barrel.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. The TIM barrel permutant is more likely to be viable because the robust hydrophobic core...is less sensitive to changes in chain connectivity...** This is incorrect. The formation of that very core is highly sensitive to the correct sequential folding of the polypeptide chain. Changing the connectivity by permutation is highly disruptive.\n*   **B. The $\\beta$-propeller permutant is more likely to be viable because its structure is composed of repeating, quasi-independent modules (blades), and its native termini are already interacting in a \"Velcro closure,\" making the structure inherently tolerant to relinking at a different position.** This statement accurately captures the key structural reasons for the $\\beta$-propeller's tolerance to circular permutation: modularity and the native interaction of termini. This is the correct reasoning.\n*   **C. Both permutants are equally likely to be viable because the new termini are created in flexible surface loops...and the native termini are spatially close...** This is an oversimplification. While having proximal native termini is a prerequisite for ligation, it ignores the much more important factor of how the overall fold topology and folding pathway respond to having the chain's continuity broken and re-established elsewhere. The internal dependencies of the TIM barrel make it far less tolerant than the modular $\\beta$-propeller.\n*   **D. The TIM barrel permutant is more likely to be viable because $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ structures have more favorable folding kinetics than all-$\\beta$ structures...** This is a false generalization. Folding kinetics are highly specific to the individual protein, not broad structural classes. Furthermore, even if it were true for the native fold, it doesn't guarantee that the permuted version would fold correctly. The disruption of the folding pathway is the primary issue.\n*   **E. The $\\beta$-propeller permutant is more likely to be viable because all-$\\beta$ structures are inherently more rigid than $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ structures...** This is incorrect. There is no general rule that all-$\\beta$ structures are more rigid than $\\alpha$/$\\beta$ structures; rigidity is protein-specific. The reason for viability is tolerance to topological rearrangement, not inherent rigidity.\n\nConclusion: The reasoning in option B provides the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for why a $\\beta$-propeller is a superior candidate for circular permutation compared to a TIM barrel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2117792"}]}
