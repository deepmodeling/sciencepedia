A firm grasp of this null result is fundamental to correctly interpreting any binding data.", "problem": "An Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) experiment is a biophysical technique used to study the binding interactions between molecules. In a typical setup, a solution of a ligand is placed in an injection syringe and titrated into a solution of a macromolecule (e.g., a protein) in a sample cell. The instrument measures the minute amount of heat that is either released (exothermic) or absorbed (endothermic) upon each injection. The integrated heat from each injection is then plotted against the molar ratio of the total ligand to the total macromolecule in the cell to create a binding isotherm.\n\nConsider a hypothetical ITC experiment where a researcher is testing the interaction between a small molecule and a target protein. The protein is in the sample cell at a known concentration, and the small molecule is in the syringe, also at a known concentration. However, suppose that, for the buffer and temperature conditions used, there is absolutely no specific binding interaction between the small molecule and the protein. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the binding isotherm that would be generated from this experiment?\n\nA. A distinct sigmoidal curve, which plateaus as the molar ratio increases, indicating that the protein binding sites have become saturated.\n\nB.

A set of data points forming a nearly horizontal line, where each point corresponds to a small and roughly constant heat signal for every injection.\n\nD. A curve resembling an exponential decay, where the first few injections produce very large heat signals that rapidly decrease to near zero for all subsequent injections.", "solution": "In an ITC experiment, the integrated heat for the $i$-th injection, $q_{i}$, can be written as the sum of a binding term and a background term (dilution/ mixing/ baseline):\n$$\nq_{i} = q_{i}^{\\mathrm{bind}} + q_{i}^{\\mathrm{dil}}.\n$$\nFor a simple binding model with total macromolecule concentration $M_{t}$ in a cell of volume $V_{0}$ and binding enthalpy $\\Delta H$, the binding contribution for the $i$-th injection can be expressed in terms of the change in average site occupancy,\n$$\nq_{i}^{\\mathrm{bind}} = V_{0}\\,\\Delta H\\,M_{t}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{\\mathrm{avg}} - \\theta_{i-1}^{\\mathrm{avg}}\\right).\n$$\nIf there is absolutely no specific binding under the experimental conditions, then the occupancy remains zero for all injections,\n$$\n\\theta_{i}^{\\mathrm{avg}} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i,\n$$\nso\n$$\nq_{i}^{\\mathrm{bind}} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i,\n$$\nand therefore the measured heats reduce to\n$$\nq_{i} \\approx q_{i}^{\\mathrm{dil}}.\n$$\nThe dilution/mixing heat per injection, $q_{i}^{\\mathrm{dil}}$, is typically small and approximately constant across injections (after accounting for minor instrumental baselines). When the integrated heat per injection $q_{i}$ is plotted against the molar ratio, the result is thus a set of points that lie nearly horizontally at a small value, reflecting only the roughly constant heat of dilution without any binding signature.\n\nThis behavior matches a nearly horizontal line of small, roughly constant signals. A sigmoidal curve with saturation (option A) requires nonzero $\\Delta H$ and changing $\\theta$ due to binding, which is absent. A steep straight line through the origin (option B) would imply heat growing in direct proportion to total ligand added, which does not describe dilution heats. An exponential-like decay with large initial heats (option D) corresponds to tight binding where early injections produce large $q_{i}^{\\mathrm{bind}}$, also not applicable here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is the nearly horizontal line with small, roughly constant heat per injection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2101033"}, {"introduction": "The stoichiometry ($n$) is a key parameter obtained from ITC, but its accuracy depends critically on sample quality.

The goal is to determine the key thermodynamic parameters of the interaction: the binding affinity ($K_D$), the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$), and the stoichiometry of binding ($n$).\n\nIn an initial \"ideal\" experiment, the biochemist uses a highly pure, 100% active enzyme sample and finds that the true stoichiometry ($n_{\\text{true}}$) is exactly 1, meaning one inhibitor molecule binds to one active site on the enzyme.\n\nLater, a new batch of the enzyme is prepared for a high-throughput screening campaign. Unbeknownst to the researcher, a protein folding issue causes exactly 50% of the enzyme molecules in this new batch to be inactive and incapable of binding the inhibitor. The remaining 50% are perfectly active. The total protein concentration is measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, which cannot distinguish between active and inactive forms.

In an ITC experiment, the instrument measures heat released or absorbed as a ligand is titrated into a protein solution. The resulting data (a binding isotherm) is then fit to a model. The software calculates $n$ based on the total concentrations of the protein ($[P]_{\\text{total}}$) and ligand ($[L]_{\\text{total}}$) that the user provides.\n\nThe apparent stoichiometry, $n_{\\text{app}}$, is defined by the fitting model as:\n$$n_{\\text{app}} = \\frac{\\text{moles of ligand required to saturate the sample}}{\\text{moles of protein in the sample (as input by user)}}$$\n\nLet's analyze the situation described in the problem.\nThe true stoichiometry is $n_{\\text{true}} = 1$.\n\nIn the second experiment, the sample contains both active and inactive protein.\nLet $[P]_{\\text{user}}$ be the total protein concentration measured by UV-Vis and entered into the software.\nLet $[P]_{\\text{active}}$ be the concentration of the protein that is actually capable of binding the inhibitor.\nAccording to the problem, only 50% of the protein is active. Therefore:\n$$[P]_{\\text{active}} = 0.5 \\times [P]_{\\text{user}}$$\n\nThe binding process, and thus the measured heat changes, will only occur with the active protein. The titration will reach its saturation point (the inflection point of the sigmoid curve) when enough ligand has been added to bind all of the *active* protein sites. The number of moles of ligand required for saturation is therefore proportional to the moles of *active* protein.\n\nLet $V$ be the volume of the ITC cell.\nMoles of active protein = $[P]_{\\text{active}} \\times V$\nMoles of ligand required for saturation = $n_{\\text{true}} \\times (\\text{moles of active protein}) = n_{\\text{true}} \\times [P]_{\\text{active}} \\times V$\n\nHowever, the researcher has told the software that the total number of moles of protein in the cell is:\nMoles of protein (as input by user) = $[P]_{\\text{user}} \\times V$\n\nThe software will now calculate the apparent stoichiometry, $n_{\\text{app}}$, using the moles of ligand at saturation (which it determines from the physical data) and the moles of protein that the user told it was there:\n$$n_{\\text{app}} = \\frac{\\text{moles of ligand required for saturation}}{\\text{moles of protein (as input by user)}}$$\n$$n_{\\text{app}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{true}} \\times [P]_{\\text{active}} \\times V}{[P]_{\\text{user}} \\times V}$$\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling the volume $V$:\n$$n_{\\text{app}} = n_{\\text{true}} \\times \\frac{[P]_{\\text{active}}}{[P]_{\\text{user}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the relationship $[P]_{\\text{active}} = 0.5 \\times [P]_{\\text{user}}$:\n$$n_{\\text{app}} = n_{\\text{true}} \\times \\frac{0.5 \\times [P]_{\\text{user}}}{[P]_{\\text{user}}}$$\n$$n_{\\text{app}} = 0.5 \\times n_{\\text{true}}$$\n\nThus, the apparent stoichiometry will be exactly half of the true stoichiometry. The software attributes the binding events to the total amount of protein specified, and since only half of that protein is actually binding, it appears as if the stoichiometry is 0.5 instead of 1.\n\nThis means that if the true stoichiometry is 1, the experiment with the 50% active sample will yield an apparent stoichiometry of $n_{\\text{app}} = 0.5$.

The experiment involves injecting the analyte at a constant concentration $C$ for a duration of $t_{\\text{inj}}$.\n\nThe ideal interaction should follow a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. However, the resulting sensorgram displays non-ideal behavior, suggesting that in addition to the specific binding, the analyte is also aggregating and binding non-specifically to the sensor surface.\n\nTo quantify this, the total observed response, $R(t)$, is modeled as a sum of two components: a specific reversible binding response, $R_{\\text{spec}}(t)$, and a non-specific irreversible aggregation response, $R_{\\text{ns}}(t)$. The aggregation is modeled as a process that causes the signal to increase linearly with time during the analyte injection, represented as $R_{\\text{ns}}(t) = \\alpha t$ for $0 \\le t \\le t_{\\text{inj}}$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant aggregation rate.
