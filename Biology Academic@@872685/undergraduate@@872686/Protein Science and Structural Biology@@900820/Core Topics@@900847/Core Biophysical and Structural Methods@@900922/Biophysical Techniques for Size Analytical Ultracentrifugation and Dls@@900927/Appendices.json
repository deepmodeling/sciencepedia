A protein sample may contain a mixture of monomers, dimers, and other oligomers, a property known as polydispersity. This exercise demonstrates how Analytical Ultracentrifugation and Dynamic Light Scattering can be used synergistically to dissect and quantify this heterogeneity, by separating the effects of diffusion from the effects of multiple species sedimenting at different rates.

To characterize this heterogeneity, two experiments are performed under identical buffer and temperature conditions.\n\nFirst, a Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) experiment is conducted. DLS measures the time-dependent fluctuations in scattered light intensity to determine the hydrodynamic size of particles.

In SV-AUC, the sample is subjected to a strong centrifugal field, causing the protein molecules to sediment away from the meniscus, forming a moving boundary. The boundary not only moves but also broadens over time. This broadening is caused by two effects: the random thermal motion of the molecules (diffusion) and the fact that different species (monomers and oligomers) sediment at different rates (polydispersity). By fitting the observed boundary broadening to a simple diffusion model, an *apparent* diffusion coefficient, $D_{app}$, is calculated, which encapsulates both effects.

[@problem_id:2101320]", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a newly purified, monomeric protein, \"Structurin,\" which has a theoretical molecular weight of 50 kDa. To characterize its solution behavior, two biophysical techniques are employed.\n\nFirst, a Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) experiment is performed. The analysis of the resulting intensity autocorrelation function reveals two features:\n1.  A well-defined decay corresponding to a particle with a hydrodynamic radius consistent with the expected size of a globular 50 kDa protein.\n2.  The autocorrelation function does not decay completely to its theoretical baseline value of 1.0 at long correlation times; instead, it plateaus at a significantly higher value of 1.3.\n\nSecond, a sedimentation velocity Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiment is conducted. The sample is monitored using absorbance optics at 280 nm. The data analysis reveals a single, sharp sedimenting boundary, yielding a sedimentation coefficient that is entirely consistent with a 50 kDa monomeric protein. There is no evidence of faster-sedimenting species or a pellet at the bottom of the cell.\n\nBased on this combined evidence, what is the most likely conclusion about the protein sample?\n\nA.

The DLS instrument is malfunctioning due to laser power fluctuations.", "solution": "We analyze the Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) result using the Siegert relation and the sedimentation velocity Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) result using basic sedimentation principles.\n\nFor DLS, the normalized intensity autocorrelation function is\n$$\ng^{(2)}(\\tau)=\\frac{\\langle I(0)I(\\tau)\\rangle}{\\langle I\\rangle^{2}}=1+\\beta \\left|g^{(1)}(\\tau)\\right|^{2},\n$$\nwhere $g^{(1)}(\\tau)$ is the normalized electric field autocorrelation function and $\\beta$ is the coherence factor.

The observed well-defined decay yielding a hydrodynamic size consistent with a globular $50$ kDa protein agrees with the Stokes-Einstein relation,\n$$\nD=\\frac{k_{B}T}{6\\pi \\eta R_{h}},\n$$\ntogether with the measured relaxation rate $\\Gamma = D q^{2}$ and scattering vector $q=\\frac{4\\pi n}{\\lambda}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)$.\n\nHowever, the reported long-time plateau of the intensity autocorrelation function significantly above $1$ (at $1.3$ rather than $1.0$) cannot arise from a purely dynamic, ergodic monodisperse protein solution. A standard explanation is the presence of a static or very slowly fluctuating scattering component (e.g., dust or very large particulates), which produces a non-decaying contribution. If the total intensity is $I=I_{d}+I_{s}$ with $I_{d}$ from the dynamic protein and $I_{s}$ from static or effectively immobile scatterers, then a mixed static/dynamic extension of the Siegert relation yields\n$$\ng^{(2)}(\\tau)-1=\\beta \\left(\\frac{I_{d}}{I}\\right)^{2} \\left|g_{d}^{(1)}(\\tau)\\right|^{2}\n+2\\beta \\frac{I_{d} I_{s}}{I^{2}} \\Re\\!\\left[g_{d}^{(1)}(\\tau)\\right]\n+\\beta \\left(\\frac{I_{s}}{I}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nAs $\\tau\\to \\infty$, $g_{d}^{(1)}(\\tau)\\to 0$, giving\n$$\ng^{(2)}(\\infty)=1+\\beta \\left(\\frac{I_{s}}{I}\\right)^{2} \\;  \\; 1.\n$$\nThus a long-time plateau above $1$ is diagnostic of static or extremely slow scatterers in the measurement volume. DLS is extraordinarily sensitive to trace large particles because, in the Rayleigh regime, scattered intensity scales strongly with size (e.g., $I \\propto R^{6}$), so a minuscule number fraction of large particulates can dominate the detected intensity and distort the correlation baseline while leaving the dominant decay associated with the protein’s hydrodynamic radius still visible.\n\nTurning to sedimentation velocity AUC with absorbance optics at $280$ nm: the data show a single, sharp boundary with a sedimentation coefficient consistent with a $50$ kDa monomer, and no evidence of faster-sedimenting species or a pellet. If a significant fraction of the protein had formed large, soluble aggregates, one would observe additional, faster-sedimenting boundaries and/or substantial non-ideality, which are absent. If the protein were in rapid monomer-dimer exchange, one would typically see either two boundaries (if exchange is slow on the sedimentation timescale) or boundary broadening/effective-average behavior (if exchange is fast), not a single sharp boundary strictly consistent with a monomer. If the protein were predominantly unfolded, its hydrodynamic radius would be larger than that of a globular $50$ kDa protein and its sedimentation behavior would deviate from that expected for a compact monomer, which is not observed. Finally, instrument malfunction (e.g., laser power fluctuations) would not specifically produce a stable, elevated long-time plateau while simultaneously yielding an internally consistent decay corresponding to the correct monomer size; moreover, the AUC result independently confirms the monomeric state, arguing against a DLS artifact that would masquerade as the correct size.\n\nA critical point is that the AUC experiment used absorbance detection at $280$ nm, which is selective for proteins (aromatic residues) and is effectively blind to non-proteinaceous dust. Trace dust or lint will either be invisible to the absorbance optics or pellet rapidly without contributing to the analyzed protein sedimentation boundaries. Therefore, the AUC result can be fully consistent with the presence of a tiny amount of large, non-protein particulates that strongly perturb DLS but do not appear in the AUC analysis.\n\nCollectively:\n- DLS shows the correct monomer hydrodynamic size plus a non-decaying baseline component indicating static/very-slow scatterers, readily explained by trace large particulates.\n- AUC shows a single monomeric boundary with no protein aggregates.\n\nTherefore, the most likely conclusion is that the protein sample is monomeric and pure, but the DLS is affected by a tiny amount of large, non-proteinaceous contaminants such as dust.\n\nThis uniquely supports option A over the alternatives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2101320"}]}
