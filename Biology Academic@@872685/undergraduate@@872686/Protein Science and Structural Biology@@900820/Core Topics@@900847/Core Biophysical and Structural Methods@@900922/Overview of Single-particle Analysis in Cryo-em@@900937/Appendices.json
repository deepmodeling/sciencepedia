In this mode, the detector's electronics and software subdivide each physical pixel into a $2 \\times 2$ grid, effectively creating four smaller \"logical\" pixels from each physical one.\n\nAfter data collection, the researcher performs a computational binning step on the super-resolution images to reduce file size and improve the initial signal for particle alignment. This binning process averages a $2 \\times 2$ block of adjacent pixels into a single, larger pixel.\n\nBased on the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, what is the theoretical maximum spatial resolution for the final, binned images?

Correcting for the CTF is arguably the most critical step in the processing pipeline that unlocked the resolution revolution. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2123315] explores the consequences of failing to perform this correction, revealing why it is indispensable for achieving a high-resolution 3D map.", "problem": "In the field of protein science, cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules. In single-particle analysis, thousands of two-dimensional projection images of a molecule are computationally combined to reconstruct a high-resolution 3D map. A critical step in this process is correcting for the effects of the microscope's Contrast Transfer Function (CTF). The CTF is an optical function that describes how spatial frequencies (corresponding to details of different sizes) are transferred to the image. It causes some frequencies to be attenuated and, most importantly, can invert the phase (i.e., making white appear black and vice versa) for certain frequency bands. This effect is dependent on the defocus setting of the microscope, which is intentionally varied during data collection.\n\nImagine a structural biologist is processing a large dataset of cryo-EM particle images to determine the structure of a novel protein complex. However, due to an error in their processing workflow, the entire dataset is averaged and reconstructed into a final 3D map *without* performing any CTF correction. Which of the following descriptions best characterizes the primary artifact that would be observed in the resulting 3D density map?\n\nA. The map would appear blurry and lack high-resolution features, as signals at certain spatial frequencies from different images would destructively interfere.\nB. The map would appear flattened or stretched along one axis, as if compressed, due to a non-uniform sampling of particle orientations.\nC. The structure would appear to have a perfect, hollow shell at a specific resolution, with all density inside and outside this shell completely absent.\nD. The map would exhibit sharp, repetitive lattice-like artifacts throughout the volume, unrelated to the protein's actual structure.\nE. The map would be identical to a correctly processed one, but the reported resolution would be inaccurately high.", "solution": "Let the true 3D Coulomb potential density be $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ with Fourier transform $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k})$.

Ignoring a phase plate and writing only the dominant phase-contrast term, one can express the CTF as\n$$\nCTF_{i}(k)=-\\sin\\!\\big(\\chi_{i}(k)\\big)\\,E(k),\n$$\nwith phase shift\n$$\n\\chi_{i}(k)=\\pi\\lambda\\Delta f_{i}k^{2}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}C_{s}\\lambda^{3}k^{4}+\\phi_{0},\n$$\nwhere $k=|\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}|$, $\\lambda$ is the electron wavelength, $\\Delta f_{i}$ is the defocus of image $i$, $C_{s}$ is the spherical aberration coefficient, $E(k)$ is an envelope function, and $\\phi_{0}$ is a constant phase offset. The key property is that $CTF_{i}(k)$ oscillates with $k$ and changes sign across alternating frequency bands, causing phase inversions.\n\nThe observed image in Fourier space is\n$$\n\\tilde{I}_{i}(\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp})=CTF_{i}(k)\\,\\tilde{P}_{i}(\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp})+\\tilde{N}_{i}(\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}),\n$$\nwith $\\tilde{N}_{i}$ denoting noise.

Consequently, as the number of images grows, positive and negative contributions at the same spatial frequency cancel, driving $T_{\\text{eff}}(k)$ toward zero away from very low $k$. This destructive interference is strongest at higher $k$ where $\\chi_{i}(k)$ oscillates rapidly with $k$, yielding strong attenuation of medium- and high-frequency information.\n\nIn real space, suppressing higher spatial frequencies corresponds to loss of fine details, producing a map that is blurred and lacking high-resolution features. This behavior matches the description that signals at certain spatial frequencies from different images destructively interfere when CTF is not corrected.\n\nThis outcome is distinct from the other options: anisotropic flattening or stretching (B) arises from orientation sampling, not from the isotropic-in-$k$ CTF; a perfect hollow shell at a single resolution (C) would require a delta-like band-pass, not the oscillatory multi-zero CTF sum; lattice-like artifacts (D) originate from periodicities or aliasing, not from the scalar, radially oscillatory CTF; and an identical map with only misreported resolution (E) is inconsistent with the real attenuation and phase inversions that degrade the reconstruction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2123315"}, {"introduction": "After initial processing, the first glimpse into the structural features of your sample comes from 2D class averaging, which combines thousands of noisy particle images into clean, interpretable projections.

The protein is a homotrimer, meaning it is composed of three identical subunits, and is known to possess C3 rotational symmetry around a central axis. In cryo-EM data processing, thousands of individual particle images captured from similar viewing angles are computationally aligned and averaged to create high-quality two-dimensional (2D) representations called \"2D class averages.\"\n\nConsider two distinct sets of 2D class averages generated from the collected data:\n1.

Both the top-down view and the side view will exhibit clear three-fold rotational symmetry, but the side view will appear more elongated.", "solution": "We formalize the symmetry and projection principles relevant to cryo-EM 2D class averages.\n\n1) By definition, a $C_{n}$ symmetric object is invariant under rotation $R_{\\hat{u}}(2\\pi/n)$ about its symmetry axis $\\hat{u}$. For a homotrimer, $n=3$ and the symmetry axis is the three-fold axis, so the object is invariant under $R_{\\hat{z}}(2\\pi/3)$ if we denote the axis as $\\hat{z}$.\n\n2) A 2D class average for a given viewing direction is effectively a projection of the 3D density along that direction, followed by in-plane alignment and averaging. Denote the projection operator along a unit vector $\\hat{v}$ by $P_{\\hat{v}}$.\n\n3) If the viewing direction is parallel to the symmetry axis, say $\\hat{v}=\\hat{z}$, then the projection inherits the rotational symmetry because\n$$\nP_{\\hat{z}} R_{\\hat{z}}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)=R_{\\text{in-plane}}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) P_{\\hat{z}},\n$$\nso the projected image is invariant under an in-plane rotation by $2\\pi/3$. Consequently, the top-down view (along the three-fold axis) will exhibit clear three-fold rotational symmetry in the 2D class average, typically manifesting as three lobes or repeating features separated by $120^{\\circ}$.\n\n4) If the viewing direction is perpendicular to the symmetry axis, say $\\hat{v}=\\hat{x}$ while the symmetry axis is $\\hat{z}$, then in general\n$$\nP_{\\hat{x}} R_{\\hat{z}}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\neq R_{\\text{in-plane}}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) P_{\\hat{x}}.\n$$\nTherefore, the $C_{3}$ rotational symmetry does not translate into an in-plane rotational symmetry of the side-view projection. Unless the object has additional symmetry elements (e.g., dihedral $D_{3}$ with two-fold axes perpendicular to $\\hat{z}$ or mirror planes), the side view will not show three-fold rotational symmetry and will appear distinctly different from the top-down view.\n\n5) Regarding averaging: 2D class averaging aligns similar particles and does not generically wash features into featureless circular blobs; rather, it enhances consistent features. Thus, one should not expect both views to be circular blobs.\n\nFrom these principles, the correct description is that the top-down view will clearly show three-fold rotational symmetry, whereas the side view, lacking in-plane three-fold symmetry, will appear different and not three-fold symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2123305"}]}
