Preliminary analysis by mass spectrometry indicated that the monomeric subunit of Chaperonin-Y has a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa. To characterize its quaternary structure, the biochemist performs Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). When the purified protein is run on an SDS-PAGE gel without any reducing agent, a single band is observed at a position corresponding to 160 kDa. When a reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol (BME), is added to the sample before loading, the gel shows a single band at 80 kDa.\n\nThe biochemist then receives a sample from a collaborator that is a mixture of wild-type Chaperonin-Y and a mutant variant. The mutation is a small insertion that increases the molecular weight of the monomeric subunit to 85 kDa, but it does not affect the protein's ability to form a disulfide-linked dimer. The goal is to visually confirm the presence of both the wild-type (160 kDa dimer) and mutant (170 kDa dimer) in the mixture.\n\nWhich of the following experimental setups would provide the best resolution to distinguish between the 160 kDa wild-type dimer and the 170 kDa mutant dimer?\n\nA. A 12% SDS-PAGE gel, because the smaller pores provide a stronger sieving effect, which is necessary to distinguish proteins with a small mass difference.\n\nB. A 15% Native PAGE gel, because it preserves the native protein shape and the high gel density is required to resolve large complexes.\n\nC. A 6% SDS-PAGE gel, because the larger pores will allow both large proteins to migrate a sufficient distance into the gel, enabling their separation based on the difference in mass.\n\nD. A 6% Native PAGE gel, because it is the standard method for analyzing large native protein complexes, and the low density is appropriate for this size range.\n\nE. It is not possible to resolve these two proteins using PAGE, as the 10 kDa difference is less than 10% of the total mass, which is below the typical resolution limit of the technique.", "solution": "We want to distinguish two disulfide-linked dimers at approximately 160 kDa (wild-type) and 170 kDa (mutant). Because the dimers are disulfide-linked, the appropriate electrophoretic mode to resolve them by mass is non-reducing SDS-PAGE, where Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate binds to polypeptides and renders the charge-to-mass ratio approximately constant. Under SDS-PAGE, migration depends primarily on the hydrodynamic size (and thus molecular mass) in a sieving gel matrix.\n\nKey physical principles for SDS-PAGE:\n- In the presence of SDS, protein mobility depends primarily on size because SDS confers a roughly uniform charge density. The electrophoretic mobility is $\\mu = v/E$, and under sieving conditions the observed migration distance $d$ at a fixed acrylamide concentration is empirically linear with $\\ln M$:\n$$\nd = a - b \\ln M,\n$$\nwith $a$ and $b$ constants for a given gel composition and running condition. Hence, the separation between two proteins with masses $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ is\n$$\n\\Delta d = b \\left|\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{M_{2}}{M_{1}}\\right)\\right|.\n$$\n- The gel acrylamide concentration controls pore size. Lower acrylamide concentration (e.g., 6%) gives larger pores, allowing high-mass proteins to enter and migrate a longer distance. This increases the available path length and practical resolution for large proteins. Higher acrylamide concentration (e.g., 12% to 15%) yields smaller pores that impede large proteins, causing them to remain near the top of the gel with compressed, poorly resolved bands.\n\nApply these principles to the options:\n- For the target masses $M_{1} = 160$ and $M_{2} = 170$, the mass ratio is $M_{2}/M_{1} = 17/16$, and\n$$\n\\Delta d = b \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{17}{16}\\right).\n$$\nTo maximize the observable $\\Delta d$ on the gel, one must allow these large proteins to migrate sufficiently far into the matrix; this is best accomplished by using a low acrylamide concentration in SDS-PAGE. A higher concentration like 12% reduces pore size and compresses large proteins near the well, decreasing the effective $d$ and rendering $\\Delta d$ difficult to resolve. Thus:\n- Option A (12% SDS-PAGE) is suboptimal for 160 to 170 kDa because the pores are too small for good separation at high mass.\n- Option B (15% Native PAGE) is inappropriate because native PAGE preserves charge and shape, making mobility depend on conformation and net charge rather than primarily on mass; additionally, 15% is too dense for such large complexes, likely preventing adequate entry and separation.\n- Option C (6% SDS-PAGE) provides large pores so that both 160 and 170 kDa species migrate sufficiently into the gel under denaturing, uniform charge conditions, maximizing practical resolution of a small mass difference at high mass.\n- Option D (6% Native PAGE) is inferior to SDS-PAGE for resolving a small mass difference because native conditions confound mass-based separation with shape and charge effects.\n- Option E is incorrect; PAGE can resolve a 10 kDa difference at this mass range when using an appropriate low-percentage SDS-PAGE gel (and gradient SDS-PAGE would improve resolution further, though not listed).\n\nTherefore, the best choice is a low-percentage SDS-PAGE gel to separate 160 kDa from 170 kDa under non-reducing conditions, which corresponds to Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2099095"}, {"introduction": "Ideal experimental results are rare, and a crucial skill for any scientist is the ability to recognize and troubleshoot common artifacts. In gel electrophoresis, visual distortions in the protein bands can provide clues about procedural errors. This problem [@problem_id:2099097] focuses on the classic 'smiling' artifact, pushing you to connect an observable experimental flaw to the underlying physical principles of Joule heating and viscosity.", "problem": "A student is performing a Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) experiment to analyze the purity of a protein sample. The standard protocol calls for running the gel at a constant voltage of 120 V. In an attempt to shorten the run time, the student decides to set the power supply to a much higher constant voltage of 250 V. Assuming the gel was prepared correctly and the buffer system is appropriate, what is the most likely artifact the student will observe on the stained gel, and what is the correct physical explanation for it?\n\nA. The bands will form a \"smiling\" pattern (curving upwards at each end), because the center of the gel becomes hotter than the edges, reducing the local buffer viscosity and causing proteins in the central lanes to migrate faster.\n\nB. The bands will form a \"frowning\" pattern (curving downwards at each end), because the high current depletes the ions required for conductivity more rapidly in the center of the gel.\n\nC. All protein bands will become excessively broad and diffuse. This is because the high voltage overcomes the stacking effect of the discontinuous buffer system, causing proteins to enter the resolving gel as a broad, unfocused zone.\n\nD. The bands in the outer lanes will migrate faster than the bands in the central lanes. This is due to the \"edge effect,\" where the electric field is non-uniform and stronger near the physical sides of the gel apparatus.\n\nE. The gel matrix will show signs of damage, such as cracking. This is because the rapid migration of proteins physically tears the polyacrylamide mesh.", "solution": "We identify the dominant physical effect of increasing the applied voltage in SDS-PAGE as Joule heating of the conducting gel-buffer system. The power dissipated as heat in the gel is given by\n$$\nP = I^{2}R = VI = \\frac{V^{2}}{R},\n$$\nso, at fixed $V$, $P$ increases with $V^{2}$ for a given resistance $R$. Moreover, the resistance depends on temperature via the conductivity $\\sigma(T)$, with $R = \\frac{L}{\\sigma(T)A}$, and typically $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}  0$, so as the gel warms, $R$ decreases and heat generation remains significant.\n\nBecause the gel slab exchanges heat with its surroundings primarily through its surfaces, the steady-state temperature $T(\\mathbf{r})$ is higher in the center than near the edges. The edges are better cooled by the surrounding buffer and the apparatus, while the central region is relatively thermally insulated. Thus one expects a transverse temperature gradient with\n$$\nT_{\\text{center}}  T_{\\text{edges}}.\n$$\n\nThe electrophoretic migration velocity of a protein under SDS-PAGE is\n$$\nv = \\mu E,\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the electric field and $\\mu$ is the electrophoretic mobility. A principal temperature dependence of $\\mu$ arises through the effective viscosity $\\eta(T)$ of the buffer/gel matrix. For particle-like migration in a viscous medium, a Stokes-type relation gives, schematically,\n$$\n\\mu \\propto \\frac{1}{\\eta(T)},\n$$\nand experimentally $\\frac{d\\eta}{dT}  0$, so that\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dT}  0.\n$$\nTherefore, in the hotter central region of the gel, $\\eta$ is lower, $\\mu$ is higher, and hence $v$ is higher compared to the cooler edges, for the same $E$.\n\nConsequently, proteins in the central lanes migrate faster and thus travel farther along the gel for a given run time than those in the outer lanes. When visualized after staining, this differential migration produces bands that appear lower (farther migrated) in the middle and higher (less migrated) near the edges, forming a characteristic “smiling” pattern with the bands curving upwards at each end.\n\nWe can now check alternative explanations:\n- A “frowning” pattern (bands curving downwards at the ends) would require the outer lanes to migrate farther than the central lanes. That would imply $T_{\\text{edges}}  T_{\\text{center}}$ or a stronger field at the edges; neither is the typical outcome. Heat loss is greater at the edges, which counters such a scenario, and ion depletion in the center is not the dominant effect under proper buffer conditions.\n- Excessive band broadening from loss of stacking is not the primary artifact of elevated voltage. In discontinuous SDS-PAGE, stacking arises from the leading/trailing ion system and the Kohlrausch regulating function; increasing $E$ does not inherently abolish stacking, although overheating can cause distortions. The hallmark of too-high voltage with proper buffers is the temperature-induced curvature.\n- An “edge effect” with stronger $E$ near the sides is not generally the controlling phenomenon in a properly constructed apparatus; thermal gradients dominate the observed curvature.\n- Physical tearing of the gel by proteins is not plausible; any gel damage from high voltage is instead due to overheating, but the most commonly observed and reproducible artifact is the “smiling” of bands.\n\nThus, the most likely artifact and its correct physical explanation are the “smiling” bands caused by greater Joule heating in the gel center, which lowers viscosity and increases protein mobility there.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2099097"}, {"introduction": "While a single gel can provide valuable information, the combination of multiple electrophoretic techniques is a powerful strategy for elucidating complex protein structures.

To determine its quaternary structure, they perform a series of gel electrophoresis experiments. The results are as follows:\n\n1.  **Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE):** When the purified, active enzyme is run on a native gel, which preserves the protein's folded state and non-covalent subunit interactions, it migrates as a single distinct band with an apparent molecular weight of 180 kDa.\n\n2.  **Non-reducing Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE):** The enzyme is first treated with the detergent SDS to denature it but not with a reducing agent. This process dissociates non-covalently linked subunits. Electrophoresis then reveals two distinct bands with apparent molecular weights of 110 kDa and 70 kDa.\n\n3.  **Reducing SDS-PAGE:** The enzyme is treated with both SDS and a reducing agent (e.g., β-mercaptoethanol), which breaks all disulfide bonds in addition to disrupting non-covalent interactions. This experiment reveals the fundamental polypeptide chains of the complex. Two bands are observed, with apparent molecular weights of 70 kDa and 40 kDa.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, you should assume that for all SDS-PAGE experiments, the protein subunits are fully denatured and their electrophoretic mobility provides an accurate measure of their polypeptide mass. Let the fundamental polypeptide chain with a mass of 70 kDa be denoted as the α-subunit, and the chain with a mass of 40 kDa be denoted as the β-subunit.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following options correctly describes the subunit stoichiometry and linkage pattern of the native Quatro-Synthase enzyme?\n\nA. The enzyme is a heterotrimer with an α₂β stoichiometry. One α-subunit is covalently linked to the β-subunit via a disulfide bond, and this α-β heterodimer associates non-covalently with the second α-subunit.\n\nB. The enzyme is a heterotrimer with an α₂β stoichiometry. The two α-subunits form a homodimer linked by a disulfide bond, which then associates non-covalently with a single β-subunit.\n\nC.

The α-subunit is covalently linked to one β-subunit via a disulfide bond, and this dimer associates non-covalently with the second β-subunit.\n\nE. The enzyme is a simple heterodimer of two polypeptide chains with masses of 110 kDa and 70 kDa.

Testing $a=0,1,2,3$:\n- $a=0 \\Rightarrow 4b=18$ is impossible.\n- $a=1 \\Rightarrow 7+4b=18 \\Rightarrow 4b=11$ is impossible.\n- $a=2 \\Rightarrow 14+4b=18 \\Rightarrow 4b=4 \\Rightarrow b=1$ is valid.\n- $a\\geq 3$ yields $7a \\geq 21  18$, impossible.\n\nThus the unique feasible stoichiometry is $\\alpha_{2}\\beta_{1}$.\n\nNext, interpret the non-reducing SDS-PAGE result: bands at $110$ kDa and $70$ kDa. In SDS (non-reducing), non-covalent interactions are disrupted while disulfide bonds remain. Therefore, any species migrating at $110$ kDa must be a disulfide-linked covalent unit whose mass equals the sum of its polypeptide constituents. Given the fundamental polypeptides are $70$ kDa ($\\alpha$) and $40$ kDa ($\\beta$), the only way to obtain $110$ kDa is a disulfide-linked $\\alpha\\beta$ pair since $70+40=110$. The remaining $70$ kDa band corresponds to the second $\\alpha$ subunit, which is not disulfide-linked and therefore runs as a monomer in non-reducing SDS-PAGE.
