By running a set of standard molecules with known weights, we can create a calibration curve that relates elution volume to the logarithm of molecular weight. This practice guides you through this essential analytical procedure, allowing you to determine the size of an unknown protein based on its elution behavior [@problem_id:2138002].", "problem": "A biochemist is working to determine the molecular weight of a newly discovered protein using size-exclusion chromatography. In this technique, a mixture of proteins is passed through a column packed with porous beads. Larger proteins are excluded from the pores and thus travel a shorter path, eluting from the column earlier (at a lower elution volume). Conversely, smaller proteins can enter the pores, increasing their path length and causing them to elute later (at a higher elution volume).\n\nFor a given column, there is a linear relationship between the elution volume ($V_e$) and the base-10 logarithm of the molecular weight (MW) of a protein over a specific range. To calibrate the column, the biochemist first runs two standard proteins with known molecular weights:\n- Standard A (Thyroglobulin): MW = 669 kDa, Elution Volume = 12.5 mL\n- Standard B (Bovine Serum Albumin, BSA): MW = 66.5 kDa, Elution Volume = 18.0 mL\n\nAfter calibration, the biochemist runs their unknown protein through the same column and finds that it elutes at a volume of 15.2 mL.\n\nAssuming the unknown protein falls within the linear separation range of the column, calculate the approximate molecular weight of this protein.

This distinction is critical when comparing molecules of different shapes. This thought experiment challenges you to predict the elution order of a compact, globular protein and a rigid, rod-like DNA fragment of similar mass, highlighting the crucial role that molecular conformation plays in chromatographic separation [@problem_id:2138013].", "problem": "A biochemist is working with a purified preparation of a monomeric, globular protein which has a molecular weight of 66 kDa. During quality control analysis, it is discovered that the sample is contaminated with small, double-stranded fragments of DNA. The average length of these DNA fragments is 100 base pairs (bp). To separate the protein from the contaminant, the biochemist runs the mixture through a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column. The SEC column operates under ideal conditions, where separation is based solely on the hydrodynamic radius of the molecules, and there are no electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions between the analytes and the column matrix. The molecular weight of a single DNA base pair is approximately 650 Da.\n\nBased on the principles of SEC and the nature of the molecules involved, which of the following outcomes is most likely?\n\nA. The protein and the DNA fragments will co-elute as a single peak because their molecular weights are very similar.\n\nB. The protein will elute first, followed by the DNA fragments.\n\nC.

Under ideal SEC, analytes partition between the interstitial space and the interior of porous beads solely according to hydrodynamic size. The fundamental elution relation is\n$$\nV_e = V_o + K_d V_i,\n$$\nwhere $V_e$ is the elution volume, $V_o$ is the void volume (interstitial volume), $V_i$ is the internal pore volume, and $K_d$ is the distribution coefficient. $K_d$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the hydrodynamic radius $R_h$. Larger $R_h$ implies greater exclusion from pores, smaller accessible volume (smaller $K_d$), and thus smaller $V_e$; consequently, larger particles elute earlier.\n\nNext, compare the analytes by hydrodynamic size rather than molecular weight, because SEC resolves species by $R_h$, not mass. The protein is a monomeric, globular species of molecular weight $M_{\\text{prot}} = 66 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{Da}$, and globular proteins approximate compact spheres; for a given mass, this geometry minimizes $R_h$.\n\nThe DNA contaminants are double-stranded fragments of average length $n=100$ base pairs with mass\n$$\nM_{\\text{DNA}} \\;\\approx\\; n \\times 650\\ \\text{Da},\n$$\nwhich is comparable to $M_{\\text{prot}}$. However, the hydrodynamic size is dominated by shape: double-stranded DNA is a stiff rod-like polymer with contour length\n$$\nL \\;=\\; n\\,l,\n$$\nwhere $l$ is the axial rise per base pair. For $n=100$, $L$ greatly exceeds the duplex diameter, producing an elongated rod with an effective $R_h$ substantially larger than that of a compact 66 kDa globular protein.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\nR_h^{\\text{DNA}} > R_h^{\\text{protein}} \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; K_d^{\\text{DNA}}  K_d^{\\text{protein}} \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; V_e^{\\text{DNA}}  V_e^{\\text{protein}}.\n$$\nHence, the DNA fragments elute earlier (closer to $V_o$), followed by the protein.\n\nReject the alternative options based on the premises:\n- Co-elution due to similar molecular weights is incorrect because SEC depends on $R_h$, not $M$.\n- The protein eluting first would require $R_h^{\\text{protein}} > R_h^{\\text{DNA}}$, which is not the case for a globular 66 kDa protein versus a 100 bp rod-like duplex.\n- Irreversible binding or elution after total volume due to charge interactions contradicts the stated ideal SEC condition of no electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is that the DNA fragments elute first, followed by the protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2138013"}]}
