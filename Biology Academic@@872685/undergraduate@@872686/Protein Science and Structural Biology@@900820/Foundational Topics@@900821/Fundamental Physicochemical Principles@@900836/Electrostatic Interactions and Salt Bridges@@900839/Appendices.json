The general rule is:\n- If the pH is less than the pKa of a group, the group will be predominantly in its protonated form.\n- If the pH is greater than the pKa of a group, the group will be predominantly in its deprotonated form.\n\nThe tripeptide has five ionizable groups:\n1.

A salt bridge is defined as a non-covalent interaction between the side chain of a positively charged amino acid and the side chain of a negatively charged amino acid.\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, the following definitions and criteria are used:\n- The negatively charged amino acids are Aspartic acid (Asp) and Glutamic acid (Glu). The negative charge resides on the oxygen atoms of their side-chain carboxylate groups.\n- The positively charged amino acids are Lysine (Lys) and Arginine (Arg). The positive charge is located on the nitrogen atoms of their side-chain amine (for Lys) or guanidinium (for Arg) groups.\n- A potential salt bridge is considered to exist if the distance between any oxygen atom of a negatively charged residue's side-chain and any nitrogen atom of a positively charged residue's side-chain is less than 4.0 Ångströms (Å).\n\nThe researcher devises several computational procedures to automate the identification of these salt bridges. Which of the following procedures would correctly and most effectively identify all potential salt bridges according to the definition and criteria provided?\n\nA. 1. Iterate through all pairs of amino acid residues in the protein. 2. For each pair, calculate the distance between their alpha-carbon (Cα) atoms. 3. If the Cα-Cα distance is less than 4.0 Å, and one residue is Asp or Glu and the other is Lys or Arg, record this pair as a salt bridge.\n\nB. 1.

Calculate the distance between the closest atoms in their side chains. 4. If the distance is less than 4.0 Å, record this pair as a salt bridge.", "solution": "We interpret the definition of a potential salt bridge as follows:\n- Negatively charged residues are Asp and Glu; the negative charge is localized on side-chain carboxylate oxygens. In a PDB context, these are side-chain oxygen atoms (e.g., OD1/OD2 for Asp; OE1/OE2 for Glu).\n- Positively charged residues are Lys and Arg; the positive charge is localized on side-chain nitrogen atoms (e.g., NZ for Lys; NE, NH1, NH2 for Arg).\n- A potential salt bridge exists if the distance between any side-chain oxygen of Asp/Glu and any side-chain nitrogen of Lys/Arg is less than $4.0$ angstroms. This requires atom-level checking of specific side-chain atoms and does not involve backbone atoms.\n\nWe translate the above into an algorithmic criterion: enumerate all pairs where one residue is Asp/Glu and the other is Lys/Arg; for each pair, compute all pairwise distances between the set of side-chain O atoms of the Asp/Glu and the set of side-chain N atoms of the Lys/Arg; if any such O–N distance is less than $4.0$ angstroms, record the pair as a potential salt bridge. This procedure is both necessary (must check the correct charged atoms) and sufficient (if any O–N pair is within the cutoff, the criterion is met).\n\nNow we evaluate the proposed procedures:\n\n- Option A: It uses $C\\alpha$–$C\\alpha$ distances with a $4.0$ angstrom cutoff and residue-type filtering. This fails the definition because it neither targets the relevant charged side-chain atoms nor uses the appropriate atom-level distances. $C\\alpha$ positions can be far apart even if side chains contact, or close while side chains do not interact. This leads to both false negatives and false positives.\n\n- Option B: It constructs separate lists of Asp/Glu and Lys/Arg, iterates over all such pairs, and computes all distances between side-chain O atoms of Asp/Glu and side-chain N atoms of Lys/Arg, then applies the $4.0$ angstrom cutoff. This exactly matches the definition: correct residue types, correct atom selections (charged atoms only), and correct distance criterion. It is comprehensive and effective for identifying all potential salt bridges per the stated criteria.\n\n- Option C: It includes Gln and Asn (which are uncharged) and uses distances between geometric centers of side chains rather than the specific charged atoms. This does not conform to the definition and will both miss true salt bridges and include non-salt interactions.\n\n- Option D: It checks only positively charged–positively charged pairs. Salt bridges per the definition require oppositely charged side chains (negative with positive). Thus it systematically excludes the required negative–positive pairs and is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only procedure that correctly and most effectively identifies all potential salt bridges according to the given definition and criteria is Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2109516"}, {"introduction": "Salt bridges are not static features; their existence and strength are often finely tuned by the protein's local environment.

The entire system is maintained in a buffer at a pH of 4.5.\n\nWhen a calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) binds to the protein, it is coordinated in part by the Glu residue.
