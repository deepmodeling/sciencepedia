{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The evolution of altruism, a behavior that benefits others at a cost to oneself, is a central puzzle in evolutionary biology. William D. Hamilton's theory of kin selection provides a powerful solution: a gene for altruism can spread if it directs benefits toward relatives who are likely to carry the same gene. This principle is captured in Hamilton's rule, $rB > C$, and this first exercise [@problem_id:1907885] provides a direct application, allowing you to perform the fundamental calculation of inclusive fitness to determine the net evolutionary outcome of an altruistic act.", "problem": "A songbird foraging in a meadow spots a stalking hawk. The bird can choose to emit a sharp alarm call. This call will successfully warn its nearby kin, saving them from predation, but will also draw the hawk's attention to the caller, significantly increasing its own personal risk. This altruistic act is thus associated with a fitness cost, $C$, to the individual giving the call.\n\nIn the bird's flock, there are 2 of its full siblings and 4 of its half-siblings. The coefficient of relatedness, $r$, quantifies the genetic similarity between two individuals. For this species, the coefficient of relatedness between full siblings is $0.5$, and between half-siblings it is $0.25$.\n\nIf the bird gives the alarm call, it incurs a personal fitness cost $C = 0.6$. The warning saves all of its nearby kin, granting each saved individual a fitness benefit, $B$, of exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$. Calculate the net change in the caller's inclusive fitness resulting from this action.

In many social species, individuals face a critical choice between dispersing to reproduce on their own or remaining in their home group as non-reproductive 'helpers'.

They can either remain in the colony as non-reproductive helpers for the single breeding female (the queen), or they can disperse to attempt to found a new colony on their own. Dispersal is fraught with peril. The probability that a dispersing worker will successfully establish a new colony and reproduce is only $P_s = 0.05$. If a worker is successful, it will produce a litter of $N_s = 10$ offspring. If a worker remains in the colony to help, it forgoes all direct reproduction. The average coefficient of relatedness between a worker and the offspring produced by the queen is $r = 0.45$. For the altruistic act of helping the queen to be favored by kin selection, the inclusive fitness benefit must outweigh the cost.\n\nWhat is the minimum whole number of *additional* offspring the queen must produce, as a direct result of one worker's help, for this altruistic behavior to be evolutionarily stable?", "solution": "Let $P_{s}$ be the probability that a dispersing worker successfully reproduces, $N_{s}$ the number of offspring produced upon success, $r$ the coefficient of relatedness between the worker and the queen’s offspring, and let $\\Delta N$ be the number of additional offspring the queen produces due to one worker’s help.\n\nBy Hamilton’s rule, helping is favored when the inclusive fitness benefit exceeds the cost:\n$$\nr\\,B > C.\n$$\nHere, the benefit is $B = \\Delta N$, and the cost is the expected direct reproduction forgone by not dispersing, $C = P_{s} N_{s}$.

The success of a strategy depends on the actions of others, as hunters randomly pair up for each hunting expedition.\n\nThe energetic payoffs are as follows:\n- If a Stag Hunter pairs with another Stag Hunter, they successfully cooperate to hunt a stag, which has an energy value of $E_S$. They share the reward equally.\n- If a Stag Hunter pairs with a Hare Hunter, the cooperative stag hunt fails. The Stag Hunter gets nothing, while the Hare Hunter, acting alone, successfully catches a hare for an energy value of $E_H$.\n- If two Hare Hunters pair up, they do not interact. Each hunts individually and successfully catches a hare, gaining an energy value of $E_H$.\n\nAssume that the population dynamics follow the principles of evolutionary game theory, where the proportion of individuals adopting a strategy in the next generation is directly proportional to that strategy's average energetic payoff (fitness) in the current generation.

Express your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Let $x$ be the proportion of Stag Hunters in the population. Random matching implies the expected payoff (fitness) to each strategy is the average over the partner’s type.\n\n- A Stag Hunter paired with a Stag Hunter obtains $E_{S}/2$, and with a Hare Hunter obtains $0$.
