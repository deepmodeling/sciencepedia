This exercise challenges you to apply the formal definition of Parental Investment (PI) to a real-world scenario of mate guarding, contrasting it with Mating Effort (ME). Correctly distinguishing behaviors that enhance offspring survival from those that merely increase mating success is a critical first step in applying the theory accurately [@problem_id:1952770].", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, the allocation of resources by an organism towards reproduction is broadly categorized into two types of effort. **Parental Investment (PI)** is defined as any investment by a parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving and reproducing, at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other current or future offspring. **Mating Effort (ME)** is defined as any investment that increases an individual's number of matings or the probability that a given mating will result in offspring.\n\nConsider a hypothetical species of spider. After a male successfully mates with a receptive female and transfers his sperm, he engages in a behavior known as \"mate guarding.\" He remains in close proximity to the female, actively fending off any other rival males that approach. This guarding behavior continues until the female lays her egg sac several days later, at which point the male departs. The guarding ensures that no other male can mate with the female, thus guaranteeing his paternity of the entire clutch. The male provides no food to the female, does not help construct the egg sac, and provides no protection or resources to the eggs or the spiderlings once they hatch. His time spent guarding the female prevents him from seeking out and mating with other females.\n\nBased on the formal definitions provided, how is the male spider's mate guarding behavior best classified?\n\nA. Parental Investment\n\nB. Mating Effort\n\nC. Both Parental Investment and Mating Effort\n\nD. Female Choice\n\nE. Interspecific Competition", "solution": "We start from the formal definitions given:\n- Parental Investment (PI) is any investment by a parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving and reproducing, at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other current or future offspring.\n- Mating Effort (ME) is any investment that increases an individual's number of matings or the probability that a given mating will result in offspring.\n\nWe analyze the male spider's behavior:\n1) The male mates and then guards the female until she lays her eggs, actively preventing rival males from mating with her.\n2) This guarding does not provide resources, protection, or care to eggs or spiderlings; thus it does not directly increase offspring survival or development.\n3) The consequence of guarding is assurance of paternity for the entire clutch by preventing additional matings and thus reducing or eliminating sperm competition.\n\nWe map these consequences to the definitions:\n- For PI: The criterion is a direct increase in the survival or future reproduction of the offspring due to parental investment. In this case, the behavior does not add resources, protection, or care that improves offspring survival or condition; it only ensures that any resulting offspring are genetically his. Therefore, it does not meet the defining criterion for PI.\n- For ME: The criterion is increasing the number of matings or the probability that a given mating yields offspring attributable to the individual. Mate guarding after copulation increases the probability that the male’s mating results in offspring sired by him by preventing rival inseminations. This exactly fits the ME definition as paternity assurance increases the effectiveness of a completed mating.\n\nWe exclude other options:\n- Both PI and ME would require simultaneously increasing offspring survival (PI) and mating success or paternity assurance (ME). Only the latter applies.\n- Female choice refers to mate selection by females, not male guarding behavior.\n- Interspecific competition involves different species; here the competition is intraspecific among males.\n\nTherefore, the behavior is best classified as mating effort.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1952770"}, {"introduction": "Parental Investment Theory predicts that when one sex invests more time and energy per offspring, they become a limited resource for which the other sex competes. This practice provides a quantitative framework for this idea by introducing the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR), the ratio of sexually receptive males to females. You will calculate how differing post-mating \"time-outs\" directly create an imbalance in mate availability, bridging the gap between the concept of investment and the prediction of sexual selection [@problem_id:1952747].", "problem": "In the study of evolutionary biology, the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) is a critical concept for understanding mating systems and sexual selection. It is defined as the ratio of sexually receptive males to sexually receptive females in a population at any given time.\n\nConsider a hypothetical bird species, the Azure Skydancer, which has a stable population with an equal number of adult males and females. During the breeding season, the mating behaviors of the two sexes differ significantly due to their distinct parental investment strategies.\n\n- A male Azure Skydancer spends 1 day successfully finding a mate and copulating. After this, he enters a mandatory 2-day refractory and recovery period before he can begin searching for a new mate.\n- A female Azure Skydancer, after a 1-day period of receptivity and mating, immediately enters a non-receptive period of 39 days for egg-laying and incubation. She will not be receptive to mating again until this period is over.\n\nAssuming the breeding season is long enough for these cycles to reach a steady state, calculate the Operational Sex Ratio for the Azure Skydancer population. Based on this OSR, predict which sex will experience more intense intra-sexual competition for access to mates. Select the option that correctly identifies both the OSR and the more competitive sex.\n\nA. OSR = 1.0; Competition is equal between the sexes.\n\nB. OSR = 0.075; Females are more competitive.\n\nC.

In steady state, the proportion of each sex that is sexually receptive at any instant equals the fraction of time that sex spends in the receptive state per cycle.\n\nFor males: each cycle consists of $1$ day receptive (searching and copulating) followed by $2$ days non-receptive (refractory and recovery), giving a cycle length of $1+2=3$ days. Thus the receptive fraction for males is\n$$\nf_{m}=\\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\nFor females: each cycle consists of $1$ day receptive (receptivity and mating) followed by $39$ days non-receptive (egg-laying and incubation), giving a cycle length of $1+39=40$ days.

This problem asks you to build a simple mathematical model of such a trade-off, where a male bird must divide his time, $t$, between caring for his current young and ensuring paternity of a future brood. By finding the optimal allocation, $t_{opt}$, you will directly engage with the cost-benefit logic that allows evolutionary biologists to predict animal behavior from first principles [@problem_id:1952740].", "problem": "A male migratory warbler is faced with a critical time-allocation trade-off. He has an existing brood of nestlings that he must provision with food, but his mate has also become fertile again, presenting the opportunity for a second brood. The male must decide what fraction of his time, $t$, to dedicate to mate guarding to prevent extra-pair copulations, versus provisioning his current nestlings.\n\nWe can model this decision using the following fitness framework:\n- Let $t$ be the fraction of the male's available time spent on mate guarding, where $0 \\le t \\le 1$. The remaining fraction, $(1-t)$, is spent provisioning the nestlings.\n- The fitness contribution from the current brood is dependent on the provisioning effort. This contribution is modeled as $W_p(t) = K \\sqrt{1-t}$, where $K$ is a positive constant representing the reproductive value of the current brood scaled by the effectiveness of provisioning.\n- The fitness contribution from the potential future brood depends on the male's paternity, which is threatened by rival males. His probability of paternity, $P(t)$, is modeled as a linear function of his guarding time: $P(t) = P_0 + (1-P_0)t$. Here, $P_0$ is the baseline paternity probability if he dedicates no time to guarding ($t=0$), with $0  P_0  1$.\n- The expected fitness from the future brood is thus $W_f(t) = V_f P(t)$, where $V_f$ is a positive constant representing the total reproductive value of the future brood.\n\nThe male's total fitness, $W_{total}(t)$, is the sum of the fitness contributions from both broods. Assuming the male behaves optimally to maximize his total fitness, determine the optimal fraction of time, $t_{opt}$, that he should spend mate guarding. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $K$, $V_f$, and $P_0$. You should assume that the given parameters are such that the optimal strategy is an interior solution (i.e., $0  t_{opt}  1$).", "solution": "We are to maximize the total fitness $W_{total}(t)$ over $t \\in [0,1]$, where\n$$\nW_{total}(t) \\equiv W_{p}(t) + W_{f}(t) = K \\sqrt{1 - t} + V_{f}\\big(P_{0} + (1 - P_{0}) t\\big).\n$$\nAssuming an interior optimum $0  t  1$, we set the first derivative equal to zero.
