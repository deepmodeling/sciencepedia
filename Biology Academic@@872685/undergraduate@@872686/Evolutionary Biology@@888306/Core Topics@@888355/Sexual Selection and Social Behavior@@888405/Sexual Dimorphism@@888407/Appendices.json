{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our exploration of sexual dimorphism, it's essential to first master the fundamental vocabulary that describes its driving forces. This initial problem presents a classic scenario of competition between males, providing a practical exercise in distinguishing between intrasexual and intersexual selection, as well as identifying whether the interaction occurs before or after mating begins [@problem_id:1963524]. Understanding these core categories is the first step toward analyzing more complex evolutionary dynamics.", "problem": "In many species of damselfly, males possess a pair of structures at the tip of their abdomen known as claspers. During mating, the male uses these claspers to grasp the female behind her head, forming a \"mating wheel\" or \"heart\" shape. In certain species where males are abundant and competition is fierce, rival males will often attempt to physically dislodge a mating male to take over the copulation. In response to this, males in these species have evolved larger and more robust claspers. The primary function of these enhanced claspers is to maintain a stronger grip on the female, thereby successfully fending off these takeover attempts by rivals and ensuring the completion of their own mating.\n\nBased on the scenario described, the evolution of these larger clasper sizes in males is a direct result of which of the following evolutionary mechanisms?\n\nA. Pre-copulatory intrasexual selection\n\nB. Post-copulatory intrasexual selection\n\nC. Pre-copulatory intersexual selection\n\nD. Post-copulatory intersexual selection\n\nE. Natural selection against predation", "solution": "We identify the relevant categories of sexual selection:\n- Intrasexual selection involves competition among members of the same sex (typically males) for mating opportunities, often via weapons, armaments, or behaviors that increase success in securing or maintaining access to mates.\n- Intersexual selection involves mate choice by the opposite sex (typically females), favoring traits that are preferred by choosers.\n- Pre-copulatory mechanisms act before or in the process of securing copulation (e.g., male-male combat, mate guarding to prevent rivals from obtaining access).\n- Post-copulatory mechanisms act after copulation has begun or after insemination, including sperm competition and cryptic female choice.\n\nIn the scenario, males possess larger, more robust claspers used to physically maintain a grip on females and prevent rival males from dislodging them and taking over the copulation. This is direct male-male physical competition over mating access and success, not a sperm-level mechanism and not female choice. Therefore, it is intrasexual and it functions to secure and maintain copulation against rivals, placing it in the pre-copulatory category rather than post-copulatory sperm competition.\n\nThus, the correct mechanism is pre-copulatory intrasexual selection.\n\nThere are no mistakes in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1963524"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify the type of selection at work, such as female choice, a deeper question arises: why did that preference evolve? This next exercise moves beyond classification to explore a compelling explanation for the origin of mate preference itself [@problem_id:1963537]. By examining classic experimental evidence involving swordtail fish, you will investigate the \"sensory bias\" hypothesis, which suggests that a preference for a trait can exist even before the trait itself has evolved.", "problem": "In the study of evolutionary biology, scientists investigate the origins of complex traits, including mate preferences. Consider two closely related species of fish from the genus *Xiphophorus*: the green swordtail (*Xiphophorus helleri*) and the southern platyfish (*Xiphophorus maculatus*). In swordtails, males possess a prominent, elongated caudal fin extension known as a \"sword,\" and females exhibit a strong preference for males with longer swords. In the platyfish, however, males naturally lack this sword ornament.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates that the common ancestor of these two species did not possess a sword. In a classic series of experiments, researchers discovered that when female platyfish are presented with choices, they show a consistent and strong preference for male swordtails over their own swordless males. Furthermore, they even prefer male platyfish to whom an artificial sword has been surgically attached over unaltered male platyfish.\n\nGiven this experimental evidence and the evolutionary history of the trait, which of the following hypotheses regarding the evolution of female mate preference is most strongly supported?\n\nA. The \"Good Genes\" Hypothesis, which proposes that the sword is an honest indicator of a male's superior genetic quality, such as disease resistance or viability.\n\nB. The \"Direct Benefits\" Hypothesis, which suggests females who choose males with swords gain immediate, non-genetic advantages like access to better resources or reduced predation risk.\n\nC. The \"Species Recognition\" Hypothesis, which posits that the sword functions primarily as a signal to help females identify and mate with males of their own species.\n\nD. The \"Sensory Bias\" Hypothesis, which argues that the female preference for a trait can evolve before the trait itself, due to a pre-existing bias in the female's sensory system.\n\nE. The \"Fisherian Runaway\" Hypothesis, which describes a self-reinforcing feedback loop where a genetic correlation develops between female preference and the male trait.", "solution": "We begin with the key empirical observations and phylogenetic inference:\n1. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the common ancestor of the green swordtail and southern platyfish lacked the male sword trait.\n2. Female platyfish preferentially choose male swordtails over their own conspecific swordless males.\n3. Female platyfish also preferentially choose conspecific males with an experimentally attached artificial sword over unaltered conspecific males.\n\nFrom 1 and 2–3, we infer that a preference for the sword-like stimulus exists in platyfish despite the absence of the sword trait in their own males and its absence in the common ancestor. Therefore, the female preference must have preceded the evolution of the male sword trait in swordtails; that is, the preference did not arise in response to the trait but existed as a pre-existing bias that could later be exploited by the evolution of the sword in swordtails.\n\nWe evaluate the hypotheses:\n- Good Genes (A): This posits the sword signals male genetic quality. The strong preference by female platyfish for heterospecific swordtails and even for conspecific males bearing surgically attached, non-heritable swords undermines the notion that the preference is tracking genetic quality in their own species; the preference is expressed in the absence of any reliable cue of male genetic superiority within platyfish.\n- Direct Benefits (B): This predicts immediate non-genetic advantages (e.g., resources, reduced predation). Preferring heterospecific males or conspecifics with artificial swords does not plausibly deliver direct benefits, and may reduce reproductive success, so the evidence does not support this mechanism.\n- Species Recognition (C): This would predict preference for conspecific males. The observed preference for heterospecific swordtails contradicts this hypothesis.\n- Fisherian Runaway (E): While runaway dynamics can amplify a trait and preference once both segregate in a population, this framework does not by itself explain the origin of a female preference in a species lacking the male trait. The evidence that the preference predates the trait specifically supports a pre-existing bias rather than coevolution initiated by the trait.\n- Sensory Bias (D): This explicitly predicts that a female sensory bias for certain stimuli can evolve before the corresponding male trait. The platyfish data—preference for swords in the absence of the trait in their own species and in the ancestor—match this prediction directly.\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis most strongly supported by the given evidence is the Sensory Bias Hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1963537"}, {"introduction": "The dynamics of sexual selection are not always a one-way street of competitive males and choosy females. The final practice problem challenges this common paradigm by presenting a scenario where both sexes invest heavily in raising offspring [@problem_id:1963505]. This situation often leads to mutual sexual selection, where both males and females are choosy and may evolve elaborate ornaments. This exercise will help you understand how a species' mating system and parental care strategy can fundamentally shape the evolution of dimorphism—or in this case, mutual ornamentation.", "problem": "In the dense, low-light understory of a remote tropical island, a species of bird known as the Azure-Crested Glimmerwing exhibits a unique set of behaviors. Ornithologists have observed that these birds form long-term, socially monogamous pair bonds that often last a lifetime. Both male and female Glimmerwings contribute equally to all aspects of parenting, including nest construction, egg incubation, and the feeding of their altricial chicks. A striking feature of this species is that both sexes possess a prominent crest of iridescent blue feathers. The size and vibrancy of this crest vary among individuals. During the breeding season, potential mates engage in elaborate, coordinated, and mutual courtship displays, where they face each other and rhythmically bob their heads, prominently showcasing their crests. After a pair bond is formed, they continue to perform these displays, albeit less frequently, throughout their time together.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements provides the most likely evolutionary explanation for the presence of mutual ornamentation and displays in the Azure-Crested Glimmerwing?\n\nA. The crests are primarily a result of intrasexual selection, used by individuals of both sexes to intimidate same-sex rivals competing for nesting territories, with the courtship display being a secondary, ritualized form of this aggression.\n\nB. The crests originally evolved in males due to strong female choice for vibrant coloration, and their subsequent appearance in females is a non-adaptive consequence of the shared genetic architecture between the sexes.\n\nC. The crest is a neutral trait that became fixed in the population due to random genetic drift, and the associated courtship behavior is a culturally transmitted ritual with no direct link to individual fitness.\n\nD. The high and equal parental investment by both sexes has led to mutual sexual selection, where both males and females are choosy and use the crests as an honest signal to assess the quality and fitness of a potential long-term partner.\n\nE. The primary function of the crest is species recognition to prevent hybridization with other closely related bird species in the same habitat, and the mutual display reinforces this recognition at close quarters.", "solution": "Key observations to account for are: socially monogamous, long-term pair bonds; equal biparental care (nest building, incubation, feeding); both sexes possess the same conspicuous ornament (a variable, iridescent crest); mutual, coordinated courtship displays directed at each other both before and after pair formation.\n\nFrom parental investment theory (Trivers) and sexual selection theory, when both sexes invest heavily and similarly in offspring, the cost of mating mistakes is high for both sexes. This leads to mutual mate choice and mutual sexual selection, which predicts that both sexes will evolve signaling traits used to assess partner quality. Signaling theory further predicts that costly or condition-dependent traits can function as honest indicators of individual quality, including parental ability and long-term cooperative potential. Mutual courtship displays serve both in mate assessment prior to pairing and in pair-bond maintenance thereafter.\n\nEvaluate each option against these predictions and the observations:\n\n- Option A (intrasexual selection for intimidation of rivals): If the primary function were intimidation of same-sex rivals, we would expect the display to be primarily directed at rivals rather than mutual and coordinated between potential mates. Moreover, equal parental investment in a socially monogamous system typically reduces the intensity of sex-biased intrasexual competition and instead favors mutual intersexual selection. The observed mutual displays aimed at each other contradict a primarily rival-intimidation function.\n\n- Option B (male-origin ornament with non-adaptive female expression via shared genetics): A purely non-adaptive correlated response in females is unlikely given that females actively participate in mutual courtship displays and face similar selection for choosing high-quality, cooperative partners under equal parental investment. The continued use of the display after pair formation also implies adaptive social and reproductive functions in both sexes. Thus, female expression is likely maintained by direct selection, not merely genetic correlation.\n\n- Option C (neutral drift and culturally transmitted ritual): A large, conspicuous, variable ornament used in courtship is unlikely to be selectively neutral, especially in a low-light understory where producing and maintaining iridescent structures is potentially costly. The tight coupling of the trait to reproductive behavior and its persistence after pairing argue for fitness relevance rather than neutrality.\n\n- Option D (mutual sexual selection under equal parental investment): This directly matches the theoretical prediction for species with high, symmetric parental investment and lifelong monogamy. Both sexes are choosy; both bear ornaments that honestly signal quality; mutual displays facilitate reciprocal assessment and later reinforce the pair bond. The observed variance in crest size and vibrancy is consistent with condition dependence and honest signaling.\n\n- Option E (species recognition): While ornaments can aid species recognition, the scenario emphasizes a remote island understory with no evidence of closely related, sympatric congeners. The continuous variation in crest size and vibrancy and the mutual evaluative displays are more characteristic of sexual selection than a primarily recognition-based function. Recognition alone does not explain persistent, coordinated displays after pair formation nor the expected condition dependence.\n\nTherefore, the most likely evolutionary explanation is mutual sexual selection driven by equal parental investment, with the crest functioning as an honest signal used by both sexes in mate choice and pair-bond maintenance, as described in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1963505"}]}
