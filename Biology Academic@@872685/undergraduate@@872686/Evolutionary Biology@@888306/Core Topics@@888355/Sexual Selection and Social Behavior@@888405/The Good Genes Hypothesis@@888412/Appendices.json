{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A central challenge in studying sexual selection is separating the influence of inherited genetic quality from the benefits of parental care. The \"good genes\" hypothesis and the \"good parent\" hypothesis offer competing explanations for why females might prefer ornamented males. This exercise places you in the role of an evolutionary biologist, interpreting the results from a classic cross-fostering experiment—a powerful design used to disentangle these very effects [@problem_id:1970858]. By analyzing the survival rates of offspring based on their genetic and foster parents, you will learn to parse the distinct contributions of \"nature\" and \"nurture\" to fitness.", "problem": "In the study of sexual selection, the \"good genes\" hypothesis posits that females choose mates with certain ornamental traits (e.g., bright colors, elaborate songs) because these traits are reliable indicators of the male's genetic quality, which is then passed on to their offspring, enhancing their survival or reproductive success. An alternative, the \"good parent\" hypothesis, suggests that these traits indicate a male's ability to provide superior parental care, which is what actually boosts offspring survival.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist is studying a species of bird, the Veridian Warbler, where females show a strong preference for males with long, elaborate tail feathers over males with short, simple tails. To disentangle the \"good genes\" and \"good parent\" hypotheses, the biologist performs a cross-fostering experiment. Shortly after eggs are laid, she swaps half of the clutch from a nest attended by a long-tailed male with half of the clutch from a nest attended by a short-tailed male. This creates four distinct experimental groups of nestlings. After the nesting period, the biologist records the percentage of nestlings in each group that successfully survive to fledging.\n\nThe four groups and their corresponding survival rates are as follows:\n\n- **Group 1**: Offspring genetically sired by a long-tailed male, raised by a long-tailed foster father and his mate. Survival rate: 78%.\n- **Group 2**: Offspring genetically sired by a long-tailed male, raised by a short-tailed foster father and his mate. Survival rate: 75%.\n- **Group 3**: Offspring genetically sired by a short-tailed male, raised by a long-tailed foster father and his mate. Survival rate: 42%.\n- **Group 4**: Offspring genetically sired by a short-tailed male, raised by a short-tailed foster father and his mate. Survival rate: 40%.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following conclusions is most strongly supported by the data?\n\nA. Both the genetic quality of the sire and the parental care quality of the foster father contribute significantly and roughly equally to offspring survival.\n\nB. The quality of parental care provided by the foster father is the primary determinant of offspring survival, while the sire's genetic contribution is negligible.\n\nC. The genetic quality inherited from the sire is the primary determinant of offspring survival, while the quality of parental care has a minimal effect.\n\nD. The sire's traits are correlated with his own parental ability, but his genes provide no direct survival benefit to the offspring when raised by another male.\n\nE. Neither the genetic origin (sire's tail length) nor the rearing environment (foster father's tail length) has a discernible impact on offspring survival.", "solution": "We interpret the cross-fostering design as separating genetic effects of the sire from parental care effects provided by the foster pair. Let $G \\in \\{L,S\\}$ denote the genetic sire type (long-tailed $L$ or short-tailed $S$), and let $F \\in \\{L,S\\}$ denote the foster environment (long-tailed $L$ or short-tailed $S$).

The good genes hypothesis makes a clear prediction: if an ornamental trait is an honest signal of genetic quality, the offspring of males with more elaborate traits should exhibit higher intrinsic viability. This problem presents a hypothetical but plausible scenario where a well-designed study fails to find this predicted survival advantage [@problem_id:1970838]. Your task is to determine what this \"null result\" implies, a crucial skill for evaluating the scope and limits of any scientific hypothesis.", "problem": "In an isolated population of a fictional bird species, the Azure-Crested Warbler (*Sylvia cyanea*), males possess a prominent crest of feathers. The length and color saturation of this crest are highly variable among males, and it is known from behavioral studies that females preferentially mate with males that have the longest and most vividly colored crests. This ornament is costly to produce and maintain.\n\nTo investigate the evolutionary basis for this female preference, a team of researchers conducted a long-term study. They established two experimental groups. In Group 1, females were mated with males from the top 10% of the population in terms of crest ornamentation. In Group 2, females were mated with males from the bottom 10% of the population in terms of crest ornamentation. To isolate the effect of genes from parental care, all eggs were collected and incubated under standardized laboratory conditions. The resulting chicks were hand-reared in an identical environment and monitored until they reached fledgling age.\n\nThe study meticulously tracked the survival rate of the offspring from egg to fledgling. After analyzing a large dataset collected over several breeding seasons, the researchers concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in the survival rate of offspring between Group 1 and Group 2.\n\nAssuming the experimental design is robust and the results are conclusive for this population, what do these findings imply regarding the good genes hypothesis as an explanation for female preference in the Azure-Crested Warbler?\n\nA. The results do not support a key prediction of the good genes hypothesis for this trait, as the ornament does not appear to signal heritable viability benefits for offspring.\n\nB. The female's choice of an ornamented mate must be based on direct benefits, such as the male providing a superior territory or better nuptial gifts.\n\nC. The findings strongly support the Fisherian runaway selection model, where the ornament's attractiveness is arbitrary and has become genetically linked to the female preference itself.\n\nD. The study demonstrates that sexual selection is not operating on the Azure-Crested Warbler population.\n\nE. The ornamented males must actually have lower intrinsic genetic quality, which is perfectly offset by some unmeasured positive environmental effect that was not controlled for.", "solution": "Define the key prediction of the good genes hypothesis for this trait: if the male ornament honestly signals heritable viability, then offspring of males with more elaborate ornaments should exhibit higher viability when environmental and parental care effects are controlled. Let $S_{\\text{top}}$ denote the survival probability from egg to fledgling for offspring sired by males in the top decile of ornamentation, and $S_{\\text{bottom}}$ the analogous survival for offspring sired by males in the bottom decile. The good genes prediction under standardized rearing can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[S_{\\text{top}}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[S_{\\text{bottom}}\\right]>0.\n$$\n\nThe experimental design removes direct environmental and parental care effects by collecting eggs, incubating them under identical conditions, and hand-rearing all chicks in the same environment. Thus, any difference in $S$ between groups would be attributable to heritable genetic differences associated with the ornament, rather than direct benefits provided by males (such as territories, care, or nuptial gifts). Therefore, the test isolates the indirect genetic benefit prediction of the good genes hypothesis with respect to offspring viability.\n\nThe observed result is no statistically significant difference in survival between groups. Interpreting the study as robust and conclusive for this population, this implies:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[S_{\\text{top}}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[S_{\\text{bottom}}\\right],\n$$\ncontradicting the inequality predicted by the good genes hypothesis for viability benefits of this ornament. Hence, for this trait in this population, elaborate crests do not appear to signal heritable viability advantages detectable as increased survival to fledging under controlled rearing.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A states that the results do not support a key prediction of the good genes hypothesis for this trait because the ornament does not signal heritable viability benefits. This directly matches the logic above and is supported.\n- B asserts that female choice must be based on direct benefits. The experiment does not test or demonstrate that direct benefits are the basis; it only rules out detectable indirect genetic viability benefits under controlled rearing. Therefore, “must” is unwarranted.\n- C claims strong support for Fisherian runaway. While the absence of viability benefits is consistent with Fisherian mechanisms or “sexy sons,” the study did not test mating success of sons or genetic covariance between trait and preference, so “strongly support” is not justified.\n- D claims sexual selection is not operating. Female preference exists in this species, so sexual selection is operating; the result only addresses one proposed mechanism.\n- E posits that ornamented males must have lower intrinsic genetic quality perfectly offset by environment. This is ad hoc and incompatible with the controlled, standardized rearing; the study design specifically minimizes environmental confounds.\n\nTherefore, the correct implication is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1970838"}, {"introduction": "The evolution of mate choice does not occur in a vacuum; it is shaped by the ecological context in which an animal lives. While choosing a high-quality mate can provide significant genetic benefits to offspring, the act of being choosy can be costly for the female in terms of time, energy, and survival risk. This practice uses a mathematical model to quantify the trade-off between the benefit of obtaining good genes and the cost of searching for them [@problem_id:1970847]. By calculating the critical threshold at which being less choosy becomes the more advantageous strategy, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how ecological pressures like predation can constrain and shape the evolution of mating preferences.", "problem": "In a species of a hypothetical lek-breeding bird, female mate choice is influenced by predation risk. A female can adopt one of two genetically determined, fixed strategies for the mating season: a \"Choosy\" strategy or a \"Non-choosy\" strategy.\n\nThe population consists of two types of males: high-quality males, which constitute a proportion $q$ of the male population, and low-quality males, which constitute the remaining proportion $1-q$. Mating with a high-quality male results in offspring with an expected fitness of $F_H$, while mating with a low-quality male results in offspring with an expected fitness of $F_L$.\n\nA female's search for a mate involves a series of discrete encounters with individual males. Each encounter, regardless of male quality, exposes the female to a predation risk, such that her probability of surviving the encounter is $s$.\n\n- A **Choosy** female inspects each male she encounters and continues searching until she successfully finds and mates with a high-quality male. She is exposed to predation risk during each encounter.\n- A **Non-choosy** female mates with the very first male she encounters, after which her search ends. She is exposed to predation risk only for this single encounter.\n\nAssume an unlimited number of males are available to be encountered. The overall fitness of a female's strategy is the sum of fitness contributions from all possible sequences of events, where each contribution is the product of the total survival probability for that sequence and the resulting offspring fitness.\n\nGiven that the proportion of high-quality males is $q = 0.15$ and that the fitness of their offspring, $F_H$, is 80% greater than the fitness of offspring from low-quality mates, $F_L$, determine the critical value of the per-encounter survival probability, $s_{crit}$, below which the Non-choosy strategy yields a higher expected fitness than the Choosy strategy.
