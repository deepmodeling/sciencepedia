This practice problem explores the case of brood parasitism, where a host species provides costly care to the offspring of another species. By analyzing the fitness consequences for the reed warbler host, you will see why relatedness, $r$, is a crucial component of Hamilton's rule and how its absence can lead to costly, maladaptive outcomes. [@problem_id:1942910]", "problem": "A reed warbler provides a classic example of host-parasite coevolution with the common cuckoo. Consider a specific case involving a single reed warbler mother. The warbler has laid a clutch of $N_w$ eggs in her nest. A female cuckoo visits the nest, removes $N_e$ of the warbler's eggs, and lays a single egg of her own. The warbler mother, unable to distinguish the foreign egg, incubates it along with her remaining eggs. After hatching, the mother provisions the cuckoo chick with food alongside her own biological chicks.\n\nTo quantify the evolutionary consequences of this behavior, we will model the mother's fitness. The direct fitness of the mother is defined as the expected number of her own offspring that successfully fledge. The survival probability of any single chick (warbler or cuckoo) to fledging is directly proportional to the amount of food it receives, according to the relation $P = k \\cdot f$, where $f$ is the amount of food units received and $k$ is a proportionality constant. This linear relationship holds for the range of food amounts considered. The total amount of food the mother can bring to the nest is a fixed quantity, $F_{total}$.\n\nDue to its larger size and more aggressive begging, the cuckoo chick receives a fraction $\\alpha$ of the total daily food, $F_{total}$. The remaining food is distributed equally among the surviving warbler chicks in the nest.\n\nCalculate the net change in the warbler mother's inclusive fitness that results from the presence and subsequent feeding of the cuckoo chick. This change should be calculated by comparing the parasitized scenario to a hypothetical baseline scenario. In the baseline scenario, the cuckoo still removes $N_e$ eggs, but the warbler mother recognizes and removes the cuckoo egg before hatching, allowing her to dedicate all food resources ($F_{total}$) to her own remaining brood.\n\nUse the following values for your calculation:\n*   Initial number of warbler eggs, $N_w = 5$.\n*   Number of warbler eggs removed by the cuckoo, $N_e = 1$.\n*   Total food units per day, $F_{total} = 120$.\n*   Fraction of food allocated to the cuckoo chick, $\\alpha = 0.40$.\n*   Survival-food proportionality constant, $k = 0.0125$ per food unit.\n\nExpress your answer as a single real number representing the change in the expected number of the warbler's fledged offspring.

Because the cuckoo chick is unrelated to the warbler mother, its survival contributes zero to the mother's inclusive fitness; therefore, in this setup, inclusive fitness change equals the change in her direct fitness.\n\nLet the number of warbler chicks after egg removal be $N_{r} = N_{w} - N_{e}$. The total daily food available is $F_{total}$. Each chick's survival probability is proportional to the food it receives, with $P = k f$.\n\nBaseline (cuckoo egg recognized and removed): All food $F_{total}$ is shared equally among the $N_{r}$ warbler chicks.

This scenario challenges you to distinguish kin selection from other evolutionary mechanisms, such as \"pay-to-stay\" or reciprocity. Analyzing the floater's decision will demonstrate how future direct fitness gains can outweigh immediate costs, providing an alternative pathway for the evolution of helping behavior. [@problem_id:1942876]", "problem": "In a particular species of bird, the Azure Jay, suitable breeding territories are a scarce and critical resource. Some adult birds, known as \"floaters,\" do not hold a territory and thus have very low reproductive success. A floater has the option to act as a \"helper\" to an established, territorial breeding pair for a season. The floater is known to be completely unrelated to the pair it helps.\n\nIf a floater chooses to help, it incurs a cost by expending energy and forgoing the small chance of finding a low-quality territory for itself. This cost is equivalent to a loss of 0.2 offspring in terms of lifetime reproductive success ($C=0.2$). The helper's assistance in defending the nest and feeding the young increases the breeding pair's reproductive success for that season by 1.0 surviving offspring ($B=1.0$). In return for helping, the floater gains a significant advantage: if one of the territory owners dies or disappears during the year (an event with probability $p=0.4$), the floater is guaranteed to inherit the high-quality territory. A bird that possesses such a territory has an expected lifetime reproductive success of 5.0 offspring ($V=5.0$).\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following statements provides the most accurate evolutionary explanation for the floater's helping behavior?\n\nA. The behavior is driven by kin selection. The net inclusive fitness gain for the floater is calculated as $rB - C$, where a non-zero relatedness ($r$) must be assumed, making the behavior beneficial.\n\nB. The behavior is maladaptive. The net change in the floater's lifetime fitness is -0.2, as it loses personal reproductive opportunities without gaining any indirect fitness benefits from helping the unrelated pair.\n\nC. The behavior is favored due to a form of direct reciprocity. The immediate cost to the floater is outweighed by the expected future direct fitness benefit it gains from the possibility of inheriting the territory.\n\nD. The behavior is an example of group selection. Floaters help for the good of the Azure Jay population, as the presence of helpers increases the overall number of surviving chicks and thus group viability.\n\nE. This is a case of kin recognition failure. The helping instinct evolved to aid relatives, and floaters are making an error by helping non-kin, representing an evolutionary \"trap\" for this behavior.", "solution": "Let the floater’s change in expected lifetime reproductive success from helping, relative to not helping, be given by the standard inclusive-fitness accounting. Because the floater is unrelated to the breeding pair, relatedness is $r=0$, so there is no indirect fitness gain from the breeding pair’s extra offspring. Therefore the inclusive-fitness effect reduces to a purely direct-fitness calculation.\n\nDefine:\n- $C$ as the immediate direct cost of helping in lifetime offspring units.\n- $B$ as the benefit to the breeding pair’s offspring number; this provides no indirect fitness to the floater because $r=0$.\n- $p$ as the probability that a breeder disappears, creating a vacancy that the helper inherits.\n- $V$ as the expected lifetime reproductive success associated with inheriting the high-quality territory.\n\nThe expected direct-fitness benefit to the floater from helping is the probability of vacancy times the value of inheriting the territory, i.e.,\n$$\n\\text{expected direct benefit} = pV.\n$$\nThe immediate direct cost paid by helping is $C$. Hence the net expected change in the floater’s lifetime fitness from helping, relative to not helping, is\n$$\n\\Delta W = pV - C.\n$$\nThe behavior is favored by selection when\n$$\npV - C > 0.\n$$\nGiven the parameters stated in the problem, this inequality holds, so helping yields a positive expected direct-fitness return via future territory inheritance. Because $r=0$, kin selection does not apply, and the benefit $B$ to the pair does not contribute to the floater’s inclusive fitness. Group selection is not required, nor is there a kin-recognition error. The correct interpretation is that helping is favored due to a direct future fitness benefit obtained through social queuing/pay-to-stay, which is encapsulated by option C’s description of an immediate cost outweighed by an expected future direct benefit from inheriting the territory.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1942876"}]}
