By calculating the equilibrium levels of effort, you can gain a deeper understanding of how external ecological factors shape parental investment strategies.", "problem": "In evolutionary biology, sexual conflict arises when the evolutionary fitness interests of males and females diverge. Consider a model of a bird species with biparental care where such a conflict emerges over the amount of parental effort each parent should provide.\n\nThe fitness of each parent is determined by a combination of the current brood's success, the opportunities for future reproduction, and the costs of exerting effort. This can be mathematically modeled as follows:\n\nLet $E_m$ and $E_f$ be the parental effort levels of the male and female, respectively. These efforts are normalized to be between 0 and 1.\n\n1.  **Brood Success**: The success of the brood, $S(E_m, E_f)$, depends on the combined efforts of both parents. Due to some redundancy in their tasks (e.g., both bringing similar food items), the combined benefit is not purely additive. The relationship is given by:\n    $S(E_m, E_f) = k(E_m + E_f - \\gamma E_m E_f)$\n    where $k$ is a scaling factor for the benefit of care, and $\\gamma$ represents the degree of redundancy.\n\n2.  **Cost of Effort**: Providing care is physiologically costly, reducing a parent's own condition and survival. This cost, $C(E)$, is assumed to increase quadratically with effort:\n    $C(E) = c E^2$\n    where $c$ is a cost coefficient, applicable to both parents.\n\n3.  **Alternative Mating Opportunities**: The male parent can gain additional fitness by seeking matings with other females. The fitness gained from these opportunities, $M(E_m)$, is proportional to the effort he does *not* invest in the current brood:\n    $M(E_m) = A(1 - E_m)$\n    where $A$ represents the availability of alternative mates. The female is assumed to be fully committed to the current brood and has no such opportunities.\n\nThe total fitness for each parent, $W$, is the sum of benefits minus costs.\n-   Male's fitness: $W_m = S(E_m, E_f) + M(E_m) - C(E_m)$\n-   Female's fitness: $W_f = S(E_m, E_f) - C(E_f)$\n\nEach parent is assumed to adjust its own effort to maximize its personal fitness, given the effort level of its partner. The stable outcome of this strategic interaction is a Nash Equilibrium of effort levels, $(E_m^{eq}, E_f^{eq})$.\n\nNow, consider two different ecological scenarios for this species:\n-   **Scenario 1**: A 'low-opportunity' environment where alternative mates are scarce, represented by $A_1$. Let the resulting equilibrium male effort be $E_{m,1}$.\n-   **Scenario 2**: A 'high-opportunity' environment where alternative mates are abundant, represented by $A_2$. Let the resulting equilibrium male effort be $E_{m,2}$.\n\nUsing the following parameter values:\n-   Benefit scaling factor, $k = 3.0$\n-   Redundancy parameter, $\\gamma = 0.5$\n-   Cost coefficient, $c = 4.0$\n-   Low mate availability, $A_1 = 1.0$\n-   High mate availability, $A_2 = 2.0$\n\nCalculate the ratio of the male's parental effort in the high-opportunity environment to his effort in the low-opportunity environment, $\\frac{E_{m,2}}{E_{m,1}}$.

While a female may gain genetic benefits by mating with a higher-quality male than her social partner, she risks retaliation, often in the form of reduced parental care from her social partner, which can negatively affect the survival of her entire brood.\n\nConsider a simplified model for a female bird's reproductive strategy. Her fitness is measured by the total genetic contribution of her offspring to the next generation.\n\n- Her clutch consists of $N$ eggs.\n- If she remains strictly monogamous, all offspring are sired by her social partner. Each of these offspring has an average genetic fitness value of $S_s$. With full parental care from both partners, each egg has a baseline survival probability of $P_s$.\n- If she engages in EPCs, a proportion $C$ (where $0 < C < 1$) of her eggs are fertilized by a high-quality extra-pair male. Offspring sired by this male have a higher average genetic fitness value of $S_e$. The remaining $1-C$ proportion of eggs are fertilized by her social partner.\n- However, if she engages in EPCs, her social partner provides less care, reducing the survival probability for *all* offspring in her clutch by a factor $R$ (where $0 < R < 1$). The new survival probability for every egg in the clutch becomes $R \\times P_s$.\n\nTo analyze the trade-off, we define a genetic quality ratio $G = S_e / S_s$.

This conflict can be modeled using evolutionary game theory. Males in the population adopt one of two strategies: 'Display' or 'Coerce'. Females adopt one of two counter-strategies: 'Assess' or 'Flee'.\n\nThe fitness payoffs for each interaction are determined by the following parameters, all of which are positive constants:\n-   $B$: The fitness benefit of a successful mating to both the male and the female.\n-   $c_d$: The fitness cost to a male for engaging in a courtship 'Display'.
