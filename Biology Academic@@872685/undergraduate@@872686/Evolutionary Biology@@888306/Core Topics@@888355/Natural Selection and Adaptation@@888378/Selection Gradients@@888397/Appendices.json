In many evolutionary studies, researchers collect field data on phenotypic traits and corresponding fitness measures. This exercise [@problem_id:1961577] demonstrates how to calculate the linear selection gradient, $\\beta$, using fundamental statistical quantities: the covariance between a trait and relative fitness, and the variance of the trait itself. Mastering this calculation provides a solid foundation for understanding the selection gradient as a statistical measure of the strength and direction of selection derived from empirical observations.", "problem": "A field biologist is studying a population of an alpine wildflower to understand its evolutionary response to a warming climate. One of the key adaptive traits is the flowering time, measured in the number of days from the start of spring until the first flower opens. Over a five-year study period, the biologist meticulously recorded the flowering time and the total number of viable seeds produced by hundreds of individual plants. From this data, they calculated the relative fitness of each plant by dividing its seed count by the average seed count of the entire population for that year.\n\nSubsequent statistical analysis revealed two key population parameters. First, the phenotypic variance of flowering time was found to be 12.0 days-squared. Second, the covariance between flowering time and relative fitness was determined to be -2.40 days.\n\nUsing this information, calculate the linear selection gradient ($\\beta$) on flowering time for this plant population. Express your answer in units of per day (days⁻¹), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $z$ denote flowering time and $w$ denote relative fitness (dimensionless).

Real-world selection often arises from trade-offs, where a trait's effect on fitness is a balance of costs and benefits. In this problem [@problem_id:1961560], we model the fitness of an annual plant as a product of survival probability and fecundity, both of which depend on germination timing. By constructing a fitness function $W(z)$ and applying calculus, you will derive an analytical expression for the selection gradient, learning how to translate a biological scenario into a predictive mathematical framework.", "problem": "Consider a population of annual plants where the key life-history trait under selection is the germination day, denoted by $z$, measured in days from the start of the potential growing season. An individual plant's fitness, $W(z)$, is determined by the interplay between survival and reproduction.\n\nThe probability of a plant surviving to maturity is dependent on its germination timing. Plants that germinate earlier face a higher risk of being killed by late-season frosts. The probability of survival, $S(z)$, for a plant germinating on day $z$ is modeled by the function $S(z) = 1 - \\exp(-z/\\tau_f)$, where $\\tau_f$ is a positive constant representing the characteristic time scale over which the frost risk diminishes.\n\nA plant's reproductive output (fecundity), $F(z)$, is determined by its total growth, which is negatively affected by delayed germination. Early germination provides a competitive advantage and a longer growing period. This relationship is modeled as a linear decrease in fecundity with germination day: $F(z) = F_{max} - c_1 z$, where $F_{max}$ is the maximum potential fecundity for a plant germinating at $z=0$ and $c_1$ is a positive constant representing the daily cost of delayed germination. Assume that $F_{max} - c_1 z > 0$ for all relevant germination times.\n\nThe total fitness of an individual is the product of its survival probability and its fecundity, so $W(z) = S(z) \\cdot F(z)$.\n\nThe selection gradient, $\\beta$, quantifies the strength and direction of directional selection on a trait. It is defined as the derivative of the relative fitness with respect to the trait, evaluated at the population mean trait value. Mathematically, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\bar{W}} \\frac{dW(z)}{dz} \\Big|_{z=\\bar{z}}$, where $\\bar{z}$ is the current mean germination day in the population and $\\bar{W} = W(\\bar{z})$ is the mean fitness of the population.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the selection gradient $\\beta$ in this population in terms of $\\bar{z}$, $\\tau_f$, $F_{max}$, and $c_1$.", "solution": "We begin with the given survival and fecundity functions:\n$$\nS(z) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{\\tau_{f}}\\right), \\quad F(z) = F_{max} - c_{1} z.\n$$\nTotal fitness is the product of survival and fecundity:\n$$\nW(z) = S(z) F(z) = \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{\\tau_{f}}\\right)\\right)\\left(F_{max} - c_{1} z\\right).\n$$\nThe selection gradient is defined as\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\bar{W}} \\frac{dW(z)}{dz}\\Big|_{z=\\bar{z}}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\bar{W} = W(\\bar{z}).\n$$\nCompute the derivatives needed.

Over a decade, the researchers meticulously recorded the primary frequency (measured in kilohertz, kHz) of the courtship song for hundreds of individual males and tracked their lifetime reproductive success, which serves as a proxy for fitness.\n\nThe study revealed two key findings:\n1.  The population exhibits a broad, continuous distribution of primary song frequencies, indicating a high degree of phenotypic variance in this trait.\n2.  After standardizing the trait data and calculating relative fitness for each individual, a linear regression of relative fitness against the standardized primary song frequency was performed. The resulting linear selection gradient, denoted by $\\beta$, was found to be statistically indistinguishable from zero.\n\nBased on these two observations, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of the evolutionary dynamics of song frequency in this population?\n\nA. The song frequency is under strong disruptive selection, where males at both the low and high extremes of the frequency range have higher fitness than males with intermediate frequencies.\n\nB. The population is experiencing strong directional selection that favors males with song frequencies near the population mean.\n\nC. The high variation in song frequency must be non-heritable, preventing any evolutionary response.\n\nD. At present, there is no significant directional selection acting on the primary song frequency.\n\nE.
