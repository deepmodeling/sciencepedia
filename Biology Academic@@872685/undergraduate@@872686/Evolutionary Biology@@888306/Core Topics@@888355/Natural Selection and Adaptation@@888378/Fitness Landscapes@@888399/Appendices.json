For each locus, there is a wild-type allele (A and B) and a mutant allele (a and b). This results in four possible genotypes: the wild-type `AB`, the single-mutants `aB` and `Ab`, and the double-mutant `ab`.\n\nTo measure the fitness of these genotypes, a competition experiment is performed. A liquid culture medium is inoculated with equal initial populations of each of the four genotypes. The initial count for each genotype at the start of the experiment (t=0) is $1.00 \\times 10^5$ cells. The mixed culture is then incubated under a specific selective pressure for a period sufficient for approximately 10 generations of growth for the wild-type. After this period, the population count for each genotype is determined using a high-throughput sequencing method. The final counts are as follows:\n\n-   Wild-type (`AB`): $1.024 \\times 10^8$ cells\n-   Single-mutant (`aB`): $9.728 \\times 10^7$ cells\n-   Single-mutant (`Ab`): $1.04448 \\times 10^8$ cells\n-   Double-mutant (`ab`): $8.192 \\times 10^7$ cells\n\nThe relative fitness, $w$, of a particular genotype is defined as the ratio of its multiplication factor (final population count divided by initial population count) to the multiplication factor of a reference genotype.

This problem focuses on a classic single-gene system exhibiting heterozygote advantage, where the heterozygous genotype is the most fit. You will calculate the stable equilibrium frequency of an allele, demonstrating how the shape of a simple one-dimensional fitness landscape dictates the genetic composition of a population over time and maintains genetic diversity [@problem_id:1929441].", "problem": "In a large, randomly-mating population of a biennial plant, a single gene locus with two alleles, `R` and `S`, governs cold tolerance. The allele `R` is associated with resistance to frost, while `S` is associated with sensitivity. The relative fitness values of the three possible genotypes, measured as the average number of successful offspring that survive to reproduce, have been determined over many seasons. The fitness of the `RR` homozygote is $w_{RR} = 0.88$. The fitness of the `SS` homozygote is $w_{SS} = 0.72$. The fitness of the `RS` heterozygote is $w_{RS} = 1.0$.\n\nAssuming that only selection is acting on this allele and the population has reached a stable equilibrium, calculate the equilibrium frequency of the allele `R`. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of the allele `R` and $q$ be the frequency of the allele `S`. Since there are only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to 1, so $p + q = 1$. The problem provides the relative fitness values for the three genotypes: $w_{RR} = 0.88$, $w_{RS} = 1.0$, and $w_{SS} = 0.72$. This scenario, where the heterozygote has the highest fitness, is known as overdominance or heterozygote advantage. Such a system leads to a stable polymorphic equilibrium, where both alleles are maintained in the population.\n\nTo find the equilibrium frequency, we can analyze the change in allele frequency from one generation to the next. The frequency of allele `R` in the next generation, denoted as $p'$, is the proportion of `R` alleles in the gene pool after selection has acted upon the current generation.\n\nAssuming the population is at Hardy-Weinberg proportions before selection, the frequencies of the genotypes `RR`, `RS`, and `SS` are $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively. After selection, the contribution of each genotype to the next generation's gene pool is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its fitness.\n\nThe total contribution to the gene pool is measured by the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, which is the weighted average of the genotype fitnesses:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{RR} + 2pq w_{RS} + q^2 w_{SS} $$\n\nThe number of `R` alleles after selection is proportional to $p^2 w_{RR}$ (from `RR` individuals) plus $pq w_{RS}$ (from half of the alleles in `RS` individuals). Thus, the frequency of `R` in the next generation is:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{RR} + pq w_{RS}}{\\bar{w}} $$\n\nAt equilibrium, the allele frequency does not change, meaning $p' = p$. The change in allele frequency, $\\Delta p = p' - p$, is zero. This leads to the equation:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p^2 w_{RR} + pq w_{RS}}{p^2 w_{RR} + 2pq w_{RS} + q^2 w_{SS}} - p = 0 $$\n\nFor a non-trivial equilibrium (where $p \\neq 0$ and $p \\neq 1$), it is simpler to use the standard formula derived from setting $\\Delta p = 0$. The condition for equilibrium is met when the marginal fitnesses of the two alleles are equal. A more direct approach involves defining selection coefficients. Let's define the selection coefficients $s$ and $t$ against the homozygotes, relative to the most fit genotype (the heterozygote).\n\nThe selection coefficient against the `RR` genotype is $s$, where $w_{RR} = 1 - s$.\nThe selection coefficient against the `SS` genotype is $t$, where $w_{SS} = 1 - t$.\n(This simplified form assumes $w_{RS}=1$, which is the case here).\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n$s = 1 - w_{RR} = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12$\n$t = 1 - w_{SS} = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28$\n\nThe change in allele frequency $p$ can be expressed in terms of $s$ and $t$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{pq(-sp + tq)}{\\bar{w}} $$\n\nAt a stable equilibrium, $\\Delta p = 0$.

The fitness of each genotype is measured as its non-negative relative viability, denoted by `W`. A population can traverse the landscape through single mutations, meaning the neighbors of any given genotype are those that differ by only one allele (e.g., the neighbors of `ab` are `Ab` and `aB`).\n\nThe fitness landscape is known to have the following properties:\n1.  It exhibits reciprocal sign epistasis.
