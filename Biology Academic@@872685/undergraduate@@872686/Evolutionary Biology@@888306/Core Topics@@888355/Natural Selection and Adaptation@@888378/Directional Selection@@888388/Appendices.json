Consequently, only the plants with higher pigmentation levels are successfully pollinated and reproduce.

The trait of interest is the flowering time, measured as the number of days after the vernal equinox.

However, due to an unusually rapid snowmelt and subsequent summer drought, only plants that flowered earlier in the season were able to successfully reproduce. The mean flowering time of these successfully reproducing individuals was found to be 68.0 days.\n\nA quantitative genetic analysis was performed on this population to understand the inheritance of this trait. The study determined the following components of phenotypic variance for flowering time: the additive genetic variance ($V_A$) was 12.0 days$^2$, the dominance genetic variance ($V_D$) was 8.0 days$^2$, and the environmental variance ($V_E$) was 10.0 days$^2$.

This advanced practice moves beyond a single trait value to consider the evolution of a reaction norm—a rule that describes how an individual's phenotype changes across an environmental gradient.
