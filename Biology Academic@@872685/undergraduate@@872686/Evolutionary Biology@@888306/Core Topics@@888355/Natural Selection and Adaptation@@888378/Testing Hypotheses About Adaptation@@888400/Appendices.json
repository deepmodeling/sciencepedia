This exercise explores how to design a field experiment to distinguish between natural selection from predators (aposematism) and sexual selection as explanations for a trait's existence [@problem_id:1968216]. Your task is to evaluate potential experimental designs and select the one that most effectively tests whether the bright coloration of a hypothetical toxic frog serves as a warning to predators.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a hypothetical species of amphibian, the Sunburst Dart Frog (*Heliodryas spectabilis*). This frog lives on the floor of a dense tropical rainforest and possesses a vibrant orange and yellow coloration. It is also known to secrete potent neurotoxins from its skin, making it highly unpalatable to most potential predators.\n\nTwo primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of this conspicuous coloration:\n1.  **Aposematism Hypothesis**: The bright coloration is an honest warning signal to predators, advertising the frog's toxicity and thus deterring attacks.\n2.  **Sexual Selection Hypothesis**: The bright coloration is a trait used in mate selection, with females preferring to mate with the most brightly colored males.\n\nThe biologist wishes to design a field experiment to specifically test the aposematism hypothesis. Which of the following experimental designs provides the most direct and well-controlled test to determine if the coloration functions as a warning to predators?\n\nA. In a laboratory setting, place a female *H. spectabilis* in an enclosure with two male frogs. One male is a typical bright specimen, while the other has had its coloration temporarily and harmlessly muted using a dark, non-toxic powder. Record the female's mating preferences.\n\nB. Compare the long-term survival rates of *H. spectabilis* with a different, non-toxic frog species that lives in the same habitat but has a cryptic (camouflaged) brown coloration. Track individuals of both species using radio transmitters to determine how many are lost to predation over a six-month period.\n\nC. Capture a large sample of male *H. spectabilis* and use a spectrophotometer to measure the precise hue and saturation of their skin. Also, observe their mating success in the wild over an entire breeding season. Use statistical analysis to look for a correlation between color intensity and the number of offspring sired.\n\nD. Create hundreds of dimensionally identical, soft clay models of the frogs. Paint half of these models with the vibrant orange and yellow pattern of *H. spectabilis*, and paint the other half a cryptic brown color that matches the leaf litter on the forest floor. Distribute both color models randomly throughout the frogs' natural habitat. After 48 hours, collect the models and count the number of attack marks (such as beak imprints from birds or bite marks from mammals) on each type.", "solution": "The aposematism hypothesis predicts that conspicuous coloration functions as a warning signal that reduces attacks by predators that have either innate aversion or learned avoidance. A direct experimental prediction is that, holding all non-color traits constant (shape, size, posture, behavior, odor, and spatial placement), the probability of attack on a brightly colored frog stimulus should be lower than on a cryptic stimulus. Denoting attack probabilities by $p_{\\text{bright}}$ and $p_{\\text{cryptic}}$, the aposematism prediction is $p_{\\text{bright}}<p_{\\text{cryptic}}$. An appropriate field test must therefore isolate coloration as the sole manipulated variable while measuring predation attempts in the natural predator community.\n\nOption A measures female mating preferences in a laboratory choice test. This addresses the sexual selection hypothesis, not predator deterrence, and provides no data on predator attack rates; it does not test whether $p_{\\text{bright}}<p_{\\text{cryptic}}$ in the wild. Option B compares survival between different species that differ in many traits (behavior, microhabitat use, locomotion, odor, activity patterns, density) in addition to toxicity and color. Any observed difference in predation could be driven by these confounds, so it does not isolate coloration; the test cannot attribute differences in $p$ to color alone. Option C correlates color intensity with mating success in the wild, again testing sexual selection rather than predator avoidance, and does not estimate predator attack probabilities.\n\nOption D uses dimensionally identical clay models that differ only in coloration, distributed randomly in the natural habitat, and quantifies attack attempts via beak or bite marks. Because the models are identical in shape and non-behavioral, and they lack toxins, any difference in attack marks between treatments is attributable to color as a signal prior to ingestion. Random distribution controls for microhabitat effects, large sample size improves power, and the response variable directly estimates relative attack rates: if aposematism holds, one should observe $n_{\\text{marks, bright}}<n_{\\text{marks, cryptic}}$, consistent with $p_{\\text{bright}}<p_{\\text{cryptic}}$. This design thus provides the most direct and well-controlled test of whether conspicuous coloration functions as a predator warning signal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1968216"}, {"introduction": "Once an experiment is conducted, the next critical skill is interpreting the resulting data to draw valid conclusions about adaptation. This practice introduces the reciprocal transplant experiment, a classic and powerful method for identifying local adaptation and genotype-by-environment interactions [@problem_id:1968242]. By analyzing how populations perform in their 'home' versus 'away' environments, you can disentangle the contributions of genetic heritage and environmental conditions to an organism's fitness.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is investigating whether two populations of a common plant, the narrowleaf plantain (*Plantago lanceolata*), have evolved specific adaptations to their local soil conditions. One population (the \"Roadside Population\") is from a habitat adjacent to a major highway that is heavily salted for de-icing during winter, resulting in high soil salinity. The second population (the \"Meadow Population\") is from a pristine inland meadow with very low soil salinity, located 50 kilometers away.\n\nTo test for genetically-based local adaptation, the biologist conducts a reciprocal transplant experiment. They collect seeds from numerous plants in both populations. These seeds are then germinated and grown in a controlled greenhouse environment to the seedling stage. Seedlings from both the Roadside and Meadow source populations are then transplanted into experimental plots at both the original Roadside site and the original Meadow site. After one full growing season, the biologist measures the fitness of each plant by counting the total number of viable seeds it produced. The average results are summarized below:\n\n*   Meadow Population seedlings planted at the Meadow site produced an average of 150 seeds per plant.\n*   Meadow Population seedlings planted at the Roadside site produced an average of 20 seeds per plant.\n*   Roadside Population seedlings planted at the Meadow site produced an average of 110 seeds per plant.\n*   Roadside Population seedlings planted at the Roadside site produced an average of 80 seeds per plant.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following conclusions are supported by the data? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The Meadow population is locally adapted to its native environment.\n\nB. The Roadside population is locally adapted to its native environment.\n\nC. The observed differences in seed production are due entirely to phenotypic plasticity, with no underlying genetic differences between the populations.\n\nD. There is evidence of a genotype-by-environment interaction affecting seed production.\n\nE. The Roadside population possesses a \"general-purpose\" genotype that has higher fitness than the Meadow population in all environments.", "solution": "Define the two genotypes by source population: $M$ for Meadow and $R$ for Roadside. Define the two environments (sites): $E_{Me}$ for Meadow and $E_{Ro}$ for Roadside. The observed mean fitnesses (viable seeds per plant) after one growing season are:\n- $w_{M,Me} = 150$, $w_{M,Ro} = 20$,\n- $w_{R,Me} = 110$, $w_{R,Ro} = 80$.\n\nTo evaluate local adaptation, there are two common criteria:\n1) Local versus foreign at each site: a population is locally adapted at a site if, at that site, its fitness exceeds that of the foreign population. At $E_{Me}$, compare $w_{M,Me}$ to $w_{R,Me}$: since $150 > 110$, the Meadow population outperforms the foreign Roadside population at the Meadow site. At $E_{Ro}$, compare $w_{R,Ro}$ to $w_{M,Ro}$: since $80 > 20$, the Roadside population outperforms the foreign Meadow population at the Roadside site. Therefore, both populations satisfy the local-versus-foreign criterion, supporting A and B.\n\n2) Home versus away for each population: a population is locally adapted if its fitness at home exceeds its fitness away. For $M$, compare $w_{M,Me}$ to $w_{M,Ro}$: $150 > 20$, so $M$ has a home advantage. For $R$, compare $w_{R,Ro}$ to $w_{R,Me}$: $80 < 110$, so $R$ does not have a home advantage. Thus, if one required both criteria simultaneously for each population, only $M$ would qualify. However, the standard demonstration of local adaptation in reciprocal transplants is the local-versus-foreign criterion at each site, which both populations meet. Hence A and B are supported by the data.\n\nEvaluate phenotypic plasticity only (no genetic differences). If differences were entirely due to phenotypic plasticity with no genetic differentiation, then after controlling early development in a common greenhouse, there should be no consistent origin-based differences within a given environment. Yet at $E_{Me}$, $w_{M,Me} - w_{R,Me} = 150 - 110 = 40 > 0$, while at $E_{Ro}$, $w_{M,Ro} - w_{R,Ro} = 20 - 80 = -60 < 0$. The dependence of the performance difference on genotype indicates genetic differentiation and rules out a purely plastic explanation. Therefore C is not supported.\n\nAssess genotype-by-environment interaction (G-by-E). A G-by-E interaction is present if the effect of genotype on fitness depends on the environment. Here the difference changes sign across environments: at $E_{Me}$, $w_{M,Me} - w_{R,Me} = 40$, and at $E_{Ro}$, $w_{M,Ro} - w_{R,Ro} = -60$. The sign change indicates a crossover interaction (nonparallel reaction norms), confirming G-by-E. Thus D is supported.\n\nEvaluate a general-purpose genotype claim for the Roadside population. This would require $w_{R,Me} > w_{M,Me}$ and $w_{R,Ro} > w_{M,Ro}$ simultaneously. While $w_{R,Ro} = 80 > 20 = w_{M,Ro}$ holds at the Roadside site, at the Meadow site $w_{R,Me} = 110 < 150 = w_{M,Me}$. Therefore E is not supported.\n\nIn summary, the data support A, B, and D; they do not support C or E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "1968242"}, {"introduction": "Adaptation is a process that unfolds over generations, which we can sometimes observe directly through \"experimental evolution\" studies.

This plant is known to produce two distinct types of flowers: open, cross-pollinating flowers called chasmogamous (CH) flowers, and closed, obligately self-pollinating flowers called cleistogamous (CL) flowers. The hypothesis posits that in environments where pollinators are scarce or unreliable, natural selection favors an increased investment in cleistogamous reproduction as a form of reproductive assurance.\n\nTo test this, the biologist conducts a long-term experiment in two large, isolated greenhouses.\n- **Greenhouse A (Pollinator-Rich):** A stable population of the plant's primary pollinator is maintained.\n- **Greenhouse B (Pollinator-Poor):** All pollinators are excluded.\n\nIdentical populations of *V. incognita* are established in both greenhouses and allowed to evolve for 50 generations.
