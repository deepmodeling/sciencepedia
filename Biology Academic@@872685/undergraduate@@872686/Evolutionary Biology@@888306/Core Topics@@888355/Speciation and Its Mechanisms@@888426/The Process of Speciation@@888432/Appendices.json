To determine the number of species present in her collection, she sequences a short, variable gene region from eight different specimens, labeled F1 through F8. She decides to apply the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC), which defines a species as the smallest diagnosable monophyletic group of individuals that share a common ancestor. A diagnosable group is one that can be consistently distinguished from other such groups by unique, fixed traits (in this case, specific DNA sequences).\n\nThe aligned DNA sequences for the gene are as follows:\n\n-   F1: `GTC AGA TTA CGA`\n-   F2: `GTC AGA TTA CGA`\n-   F3: `GAC AGA TTA CGA`\n-   F4: `GTC ACA TTA CGA`\n-   F5: `GTC ACA TTA CGA`\n-   F6: `GTC ACA TTA CGA`\n-   F7: `GTC AGA TTA TGC`\n-   F8: `GTC AGA TTA TGC`\n\nApplying the Phylogenetic Species Concept to these data, which of the following options correctly delimits the specimens into species?\n\nA.

For DNA sequence data, a diagnosable group is defined by fixed nucleotide differences that consistently distinguish it from other such groups.\n\nStep 1: Identify unique, fixed sequence types (haplotypes) among the specimens by comparing the aligned sequences.\n- F1 and F2 share an identical sequence: GTC AGA TTA CGA. Call this haplotype H1 with members $ \\{F1, F2\\} $.\n- F3 has a unique sequence: GAC AGA TTA CGA.

Incorrect.\n- Option B lumps $ \\{F1,F2\\} $ with $ \\{F7,F8\\} $, but these are diagnosably distinct by fixed differences in the last block. Incorrect.\n- Option C groups exactly the diagnosable haplotypes: $ \\{F1,F2\\} $, $ \\{F3\\} $, $ \\{F4,F5,F6\\} $, and $ \\{F7,F8\\} $. Correct.\n- Option D treats all as one species despite multiple fixed differences among groups, violating PSC. Incorrect.\n- Option E treats each specimen as its own species despite several instances of identical, non-differentiated sequences (F1=F2; F4=F5=F6; F7=F8), violating the “fixed diagnosable differences” requirement.

By integrating principles of quantitative genetics, we can model the rate at which populations diverge. This exercise uses the breeder's equation, $R = h^2S$, to connect the heritability ($h^2$) of a mating trait and the strength of sexual selection ($S$) acting upon it to the evolutionary response ($R$). By working through this problem, you can calculate the time required for reproductive isolation to arise, providing a tangible sense of how evolutionary forces shape the formation of new species [@problem_id:1973682].", "problem": "Two isolated populations of a species of firefly, Population A and Population B, became separated geographically. In these fireflies, the duration of the male's light pulse is a critical quantitative trait for female mate choice. Both populations initially had an identical mean pulse duration.\n\nDue to differences in their new environments, the populations experience different patterns of sexual selection on this trait. In Population A, which inhabits a dense forest with low ambient light, females favor males with longer pulse durations. The selection differential ($S_A$) for pulse duration in this population is measured to be $+1.80$ milliseconds per generation.
