This first exercise walks you through a classic scenario where two perfectly healthy populations interbreed, leading to breakdown in the F2 generation. By tracking the alleles from each population through a standard dihybrid cross, you will see firsthand how incompatible gene combinations, harmless in their original backgrounds, can lead to inviability in hybrids [@problem_id:1920197].", "problem": "Consider a classic case of a Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibility (DMI), a model of how reproductive isolation can evolve between two populations. Imagine two allopatric populations of a diploid organism.\n\nInitially, the ancestral population has the genotype $A_1A_1b_1b_1$ at two unlinked genetic loci, A and B. A mutation arises at locus A in the first population and sweeps to fixation, resulting in a population with genotype $A_2A_2b_1b_1$. A different mutation arises at locus B in the second population and also sweeps to fixation, resulting in a population with genotype $A_1A_1b_2b_2$. Both of these derived populations are fully viable and fertile.\n\nAfter a period of divergence, the geographic barrier is removed, and individuals from the two populations are allowed to interbreed. A cross is performed between an individual from the first population ($A_2A_2b_1b_1$) and an individual from the second population ($A_1A_1b_2b_2$) to produce an F1 generation. Individuals from the F1 generation are then interbred to produce an F2 generation.\n\nThe DMI in this system is expressed as embryonic inviability. This inviability occurs only in individuals that possess at least one copy of the $A_2$ allele (i.e., the incompatibility at locus A is dominant) AND are homozygous for the $b_2$ allele (i.e., the incompatibility at locus B is recessive).\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance and that the two loci assort independently, which of the following statements correctly describes when inviability first appears and in what proportion of that generation's offspring?\n\nA. F1 generation, with a proportion of 1/4 of the offspring being inviable.\n\nB. F2 generation, with a proportion of 1/16 of the offspring being inviable.\n\nC. F2 generation, with a proportion of 3/16 of the offspring being inviable.\n\nD. F1 generation, with all offspring being inviable.\n\nE. F2 generation, with a proportion of 9/16 of the offspring being inviable.", "solution": "The parental cross is between $A_{2}A_{2}b_{1}b_{1}$ and $A_{1}A_{1}b_{2}b_{2}$. By Mendelian inheritance and independent assortment, all F1 offspring are $A_{1}A_{2}b_{1}b_{2}$, since each F1 receives $A_{2}b_{1}$ from one parent and $A_{1}b_{2}$ from the other.\n\nThe Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility requires at least one $A_{2}$ allele and homozygosity for $b_{2}$ to cause inviability. In the F1, although each individual has at least one $A_{2}$, they are heterozygous $b_{1}b_{2}$, so no F1 are inviable. Thus inviability does not appear in the F1.\n\nFor the F2, intercrossing $A_{1}A_{2}b_{1}b_{2}$ with itself and using independent assortment, the segregation at each locus is:\n$$\nA\\text{ locus: }A_{1}A_{1}:\\,A_{1}A_{2}:\\,A_{2}A_{2} = \\frac{1}{4}:\\frac{1}{2}:\\frac{1}{4},\n\\qquad\nB\\text{ locus: }b_{1}b_{1}:\\,b_{1}b_{2}:\\,b_{2}b_{2} = \\frac{1}{4}:\\frac{1}{2}:\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nLet $I$ be the event of inviability.

This practice simulates such an investigation, where you are given the results of a backcross experiment between two fungal species. Your task is to use the proportion of fertile offspring to determine the minimum number of interacting genes responsible for the hybrid sterility, a foundational technique in the study of speciation genetics [@problem_id:1920184].", "problem": "Consider two closely related species of diploid fungi, Fungus-A and Fungus-B, which have evolved in isolation from a common ancestor. When a pure-breeding individual of Fungus-A is crossed with a pure-breeding individual of Fungus-B, the resulting F1 diploid hybrids are all viable and fertile.\n\nA geneticist performs a backcross experiment by crossing an F1 hybrid with an individual from the pure-breeding parental stock of Fungus-A. Upon analyzing a large number of the backcross progeny, the geneticist observes that exactly 6.25% of them are fertile, with the remainder being sterile.\n\nAssume that the observed sterility is due to Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. This means that new alleles that became fixed in one population are incompatible with new alleles that became fixed at different loci in the other population. For sterility to be expressed, an individual must possess at least one copy of the derived allele from the Fungus-A lineage AND at least one copy of the derived allele from the Fungus-B lineage for any given interacting gene pair. Assume that all such interacting gene pairs are unlinked and contribute independently to sterility.\n\nBased on these experimental results, determine the minimum number of interacting gene pairs causing reproductive isolation between these two species.", "solution": "Let there be $n$ independent Dobzhansky-Muller interacting gene pairs, each consisting of two unlinked loci: one with a derived allele fixed in Fungus-A and one with a derived allele fixed in Fungus-B. For pair $i$, denote the A-lineage derived allele at its locus by $A_{i}^{*}$ (ancestral $A_{i}$) and the B-lineage derived allele at its locus by $B_{i}^{*}$ (ancestral $B_{i}$).\n\nIn the F1 (Fungus-A $\\times$ Fungus-B), each locus in every pair is heterozygous: $A_{i}^{*}/A_{i}$ and $B_{i}^{*}/B_{i}$. The backcross is F1 $\\times$ Fungus-A (pure-breeding for A-lineage alleles), so the A parent contributes $A_{i}^{*}$ at the $A_{i}$-locus and $B_{i}$ at the $B_{i}$-locus with probability $1$.\n\nConsider one interacting pair $i$ in the backcross progeny:\n- At the $A_{i}$-locus: F1 is $A_{i}^{*}/A_{i}$ and the A parent is $A_{i}^{*}/A_{i}^{*}$. Therefore, every backcross progeny receives at least one $A_{i}^{*}$, so the A-lineage derived allele is present with probability $1$.\n- At the $B_{i}$-locus: F1 is $B_{i}^{*}/B_{i}$ and the A parent is $B_{i}/B_{i}$. Therefore, a backcross progeny receives $B_{i}^{*}$ from the F1 with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $B_{i}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nBy the stated incompatibility rule, sterility for pair $i$ requires the presence of at least one A-lineage derived allele and at least one B-lineage derived allele. In the backcross, the first condition is always satisfied, while the second occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Hence, for pair $i$, the probability a backcross progeny is sterile is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability it is fertile (i.e., avoids the incompatible combination at this pair) is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAssuming independence across $n$ unlinked pairs, the probability a backcross progeny is fertile is the product of the per-pair fertility probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{fertile})=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n}.\n$$\nThe observed fraction of fertile backcross progeny is $0.0625=\\frac{1}{16}$, so\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n}=\\frac{1}{16}=2^{-4}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad n=4.\n$$\nTherefore, the minimum number of interacting gene pairs causing reproductive isolation is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1920184"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of any scientific model requires recognizing its specific conditions and boundaries. This final problem presents a case of hybrid inviability that, on the surface, resembles a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility but is fundamentally different. By analyzing this scenario, you will solidify your understanding of the model's core requirement: negative epistasis between different genetic loci, distinguishing it from incompatibility arising from alleles at a single locus [@problem_id:1920151].", "problem": "A classic Dobzhansky-Muller (DM) incompatibility is a model explaining the evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation. It posits that reduced fitness in hybrids (such as sterility or inviability) arises from negative epistatic interactions between alleles that evolved independently in separate populations.\n\nConsider the following hypothetical scenario involving a diploid species:\nAn ancestral population, homozygous for the wild-type allele $G$ at a particular essential gene locus, is divided into two geographically isolated populations, P1 and P2.\n- In population P1, a new allele, $g_1$, arises by mutation at this locus. This $g_1$ allele is recessive and acts as a lethal allele when homozygous ($g_1g_1$).\n- In population P2, a different new allele, $g_2$, arises by mutation at the *same* locus. The $g_2$ allele is also recessive and lethal when homozygous ($g_2g_2$).\n\nAfter a period of divergence, individuals from the two populations are brought together and produce hybrid offspring. Genetic analysis of the resulting zygotes reveals that individuals with the compound heterozygous genotype $g_1g_2$ are inviable. This is because both $g_1$ and $g_2$ are non-functional versions of the same essential gene, and they fail to complement each other.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental reason why this specific case of hybrid inviability is *not* classified as a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility?\n\nA. Because the F1 hybrids ($g_1g_2$) are inviable; in a true DM incompatibility, F1 hybrids are always viable, and inviability only appears in the F2 or later generations.\n\nB. Because the incompatibility arises from the interaction of two different alleles at a single gene locus, whereas DM incompatibilities are defined by negative epistatic interactions between alleles at two or more different gene loci.\n\nC. Because the lethal alleles ($g_1$ and $g_2$) are recessive; a true DM incompatibility requires that at least one of the interacting alleles that causes the incompatibility is dominant.\n\nD. Because the new alleles ($g_1$ and $g_2$) are described as arising but not necessarily reaching fixation in their respective populations before secondary contact occurred.\n\nE. Because the inviability results from a simple loss of essential gene function, whereas DM incompatibilities must arise from a novel, toxic gain-of-function interaction between gene products.", "solution": "Step 1: State the Dobzhansky-Muller (DM) incompatibility criterion in formal genetic terms. The canonical DM model requires at least two different loci. Let the two loci be $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ with ancestral alleles $A$ and $B$. In population P1 a derived allele $a$ arises at $L_{1}$, and in population P2 a derived allele $b$ arises at $L_{2}$. Each derived allele is compatible with the ancestral background in its own lineage, so genotypes carrying $a$ with $B$ and $A$ with $b$ are viable. The incompatibility arises from negative epistasis across loci: certain combinations carrying both derived alleles have reduced fitness when combined in hybrids. Formally, if $w$ denotes fitness and $g_{L_{1}}$, $g_{L_{2}}$ denote genotypes at the two loci, a DM incompatibility requires a nonzero interlocus interaction term such that\n$$\nw(g)=f_{1}(g_{L_{1}})+f_{2}(g_{L_{2}})+\\varepsilon(g_{L_{1}},g_{L_{2}}),\n$$\nwith $\\varepsilon(g_{L_{1}},g_{L_{2}})<0$ for the hybrid combination carrying the derived alleles at both loci. Crucially, the defining feature is that the incompatibility is due to an interaction between alleles at two or more different loci.\n\nStep 2: Map the given scenario to loci and alleles. There is a single essential locus $G$ with ancestral allele $G$. In P1, a recessive lethal allele $g_{1}$ arises at $G$; in P2, a different recessive lethal allele $g_{2}$ arises at $G$. By construction, both $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are loss-of-function alleles of the same gene. The compound heterozygote $g_{1}g_{2}$ is inviable because neither allele provides a functional product; this is a failure of complementation at a single locus. The fitness of $g_{1}g_{2}$, call it $w(g_{1}g_{2})$, is determined solely by the single-locus genotype at $G$; there is no second locus and thus no interlocus interaction term $\\varepsilon$ can be defined. Therefore, there is no epistasis across loci.\n\nStep 3: Conclude why this is not a DM incompatibility. Because all genetic changes occur at one locus and the hybrid inviability arises from allelic non-complementation at that same locus, there is no negative epistatic interaction between alleles at different loci. This violates the fundamental multi-locus requirement of the DM model. Hence, the most accurate and fundamental reason is that the incompatibility involves different alleles of a single gene rather than alleles at two or more different loci.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n- Option A is incorrect. DM incompatibilities can manifest in F1 hybrids when incompatibility includes dominance or involves sex chromosomes; F1 inviability is not excluded by the DM framework.\n- Option B is correct. It identifies the essential criterion: DM incompatibilities are defined by negative epistasis between alleles at different loci, which is absent here because only one locus is involved.\n- Option C is incorrect. DM incompatibilities do not require dominance; recessive-recessive DMIs are possible and often manifest in later generations, but dominance is not a defining requirement.\n- Option D is not the most fundamental reason. While fixation is often assumed in simple models, DM incompatibilities do not strictly require fixation before secondary contact to be classified as such.\n- Option E is incorrect. DMIs need not be toxic gain-of-function; they may involve loss-of-function changes that are individually benign in their own backgrounds but incompatible when combined across loci.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the statement emphasizing the single-locus nature of the incompatibility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1920151"}]}
