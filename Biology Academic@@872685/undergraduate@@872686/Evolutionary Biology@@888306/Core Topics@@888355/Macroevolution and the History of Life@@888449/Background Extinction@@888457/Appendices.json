Paleontologists estimate this baseline rate by studying the lifespan of species in the fossil record.

By meticulously analyzing the fossil record, she has compiled data on the first and last appearances of hundreds of species within this group. Her analysis reveals that the average temporal duration of a single species, from its origination to its extinction, is approximately 4.0 million years. Assuming this average duration is representative of the steady, background rate of extinction for this clade, calculate the background extinction rate.\n\nExpress your answer in units of extinctions per million species-years (E/MSY). Round your final answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "Let $L$ denote the average temporal duration of a species, measured in million years (Myr). Under a constant background extinction process with a steady per-species hazard rate $\\mu$ (in units of per species per Myr), the time to extinction is modeled by an exponential distribution whose mean is the reciprocal of the rate. Therefore, the fundamental relationship is\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{\\mu}.\n$$\nSolving for the extinction rate gives\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{L}.\n$$\nTo express the rate in extinctions per million species-years (E/MSY), note that $1$ MSY equals $1$ species-Myr.

This practice applies the historical rate for vertebrates to calculate the 'normal' number of extinctions we would expect over a human-relevant timescale.

This exercise uses a simplified probabilistic model to explore why a species confined to a single location is vastly more vulnerable than one spread across several areas, even with the same total population size. This principle is fundamental to understanding why endemism is a key concern in conservation efforts and illustrates the concept of risk spreading [@problem_id:1910367].", "problem": "A conservation biologist is tasked with evaluating the extinction risk for two different species under a simplified model of environmental catastrophes.\n\nSpecies A is a rare amphibian, *Cryptosirens montanus*, whose entire global population of size $N_0$ lives in a single, isolated high-altitude lake.\n\nSpecies R is a small rodent, *Mundimys communis*, which has the same total global population size $N_0$. However, its population is distributed across $k$ distinct and geographically isolated mountain valleys. The population in each valley is of equal size, $N_0/k$.\n\nThe primary threat to both species is the occurrence of sudden, geographically contained environmental disasters, which we will term a Local Extinction Event (LEE). An LEE is defined as an event (such as a rockslide, flash flood, or disease outbreak) that is guaranteed to cause the complete extirpation of any population within its localized area. For any given year and any single location (i.e., the lake for the amphibian, or one of the valleys for the rodent), the probability of an LEE occurring is $p$. The occurrences of LEEs in different locations are statistically independent.\n\nAssume the total population of species R is considered extinct only if all of its $k$ subpopulations are simultaneously wiped out in the same year. For the purposes of this model, we ignore all other demographic factors like birth, death, and migration between valleys.\n\nGiven $p = 0.02$ and $k = 4$, calculate the ratio of the annual extinction probability of the amphibian (Species A) to the annual extinction probability of the rodent (Species R). The total population size, $N_0$, is 5,000 individuals.", "solution": "Define the annual extinction probability for Species A (single location) as the probability that a Local Extinction Event (LEE) occurs at its single site in a given year.
