One of the most significant is the \"two-fold cost of sex,\" a concept that quantifies the inherent transmission advantage of asexual reproduction. This foundational exercise lets you calculate this cost directly, illustrating the evolutionary puzzle that the prevalence of sexual reproduction presents [@problem_id:1945116].", "problem": "A biologist is studying two isolated populations of a hypothetical species of aphid. The first population reproduces asexually (parthenogenesis), where females produce only female offspring. The second population reproduces sexually, with a 1:1 offspring sex ratio (i.e., for every female offspring, one male offspring is produced).\n\nConsider a single founding female from each population. Let's call them the 'Generation 0' (G0) females. Each G0 female, regardless of her reproductive mode, produces exactly two offspring, which we will call 'Generation 1' (G1). Subsequently, all female offspring in G1 also produce exactly two of their own offspring, creating 'Generation 2' (G2). Males do not produce offspring.\n\nThe \"two-fold cost of sex\" is a concept that quantifies the relative disadvantage in gene transmission for sexual versus asexual organisms. We can measure it here by comparing the growth of these two lineages. Calculate the ratio of the total number of grandchildren (G2 individuals) in the asexual lineage to the total number of grandchildren in the sexual lineage, starting from one G0 female in each.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must track the number of offspring produced in each lineage over two generations, paying close attention to the number of females, as they are the only ones who produce offspring.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the asexual lineage.\nThe starting point is a single Generation 0 (G0) asexual female.\nThis G0 female produces 2 offspring. Since the reproduction is asexual and females produce only females, both offspring are female. This gives us 2 females in Generation 1 (G1).\nEach of these 2 G1 females then produces 2 offspring of her own. The total number of grandchildren (G2 individuals) in the asexual lineage is therefore the number of G1 females multiplied by the number of offspring each produces.\nNumber of asexual G2 individuals = (2 G1 females) $\\times$ (2 offspring/female) = 4.\n\nNext, let's analyze the sexual lineage.\nThe starting point is a single Generation 0 (G0) sexual female.\nThis G0 female produces 2 offspring. The problem states that the sexual population has a 1:1 sex ratio. This means the 2 offspring consist of 1 female and 1 male. This gives us 1 female and 1 male in Generation 1 (G1).\nOnly females can produce offspring. Therefore, only the single G1 female will contribute to the next generation. The G1 male does not produce offspring.\nThis single G1 female produces 2 offspring of her own. The total number of grandchildren (G2 individuals) in the sexual lineage is therefore the number of G1 females multiplied by the number of offspring each produces.\nNumber of sexual G2 individuals = (1 G1 female) $\\times$ (2 offspring/female) = 2.\n\nFinally, we calculate the required ratio. The problem asks for the ratio of the total number of grandchildren in the asexual lineage to the total number of grandchildren in the sexual lineage.\nRatio = (Total number of asexual G2 individuals) / (Total number of sexual G2 individuals)\nRatio = $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$.\n\nThis result demonstrates the \"two-fold cost of sex\": the asexual lineage produces grandchildren at twice the rate of the sexual lineage because every individual in the asexual lineage is a producer, whereas in the sexual lineage, half the investment (in males) does not directly result in more offspring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1945116"}, {"introduction": "Major transitions often hinge on the evolution of altruism, where an individual's action benefits others at a cost to itself.

The squirrel has three possible actions it can take in response to the predator. The costs and benefits of these actions are measured in units of fitness, representing changes in survival probability.\n\n1.  **Remain Silent:** This action has no fitness cost to the squirrel itself ($C=0$), but also provides no benefit to its relatives, as they remain unaware of the predator ($B=0$).\n\n2.  **Standard Alarm Call:** This action draws some attention from the hawk, imposing a fitness cost on the squirrel of $C=0.15$.

This shift involves a fundamental trade-off between the benefits of group living, such as protection, and the costs, such as increased competition for resources. Consider a hypothetical species of facultatively multicellular algae, *Protococcus aggregans*, which can exist either as solitary cells or in spherical colonies.\n\nWe can model the fitness of these two strategies based on their survival and reproduction. Let the fitness, $W$, be defined as the expected number of surviving offspring produced by a cell per day.\n\nFor a **solitary cell**:\nThe baseline reproductive rate is $R_0$ offspring per day. However, these cells are vulnerable to predation. Let $\\delta$ be the probability that a solitary cell is consumed by a predator on any given day.\n\nFor a cell in an **aggregate**:\nAn individual cell can join a colony of total size $N$ (including itself).\n- **Benefit (Predation Shielding)**: The colony as a whole is subject to the same predation pressure as a solitary cell, but when a predator attacks the colony, it only consumes a single cell. The risk is thus shared among all $N$ cells. We assume the probability of any specific cell in the colony being consumed per day is $\\frac{\\delta}{N}$.\n- **Cost (Resource Competition)**: Cells within the colony compete for light and nutrients. This competition reduces the reproductive rate. The reproductive rate of a cell in a colony of size $N$ is given by $R_N = R_0 \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the intensity of competition.\n\nAssuming that natural selection will favor the colony size that maximizes the fitness of an individual cell within it, what is the optimal colony size, $N_{opt}$? For this analysis, treat the colony size $N$ as a continuous, positive real number.\n\nExpress your answer as a symbolic expression for $N_{opt}$ in terms of $\\delta$ and $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the optimal colony size, $N_{opt}$, that maximizes the fitness of an individual cell within the aggregate. The fitness, $W$, is defined as the product of the reproductive rate and the survival probability.\n\nFirst, let's write down the expression for the fitness of a cell in a colony of size $N$, which we denote as $W_a(N)$.\n\nThe reproductive rate for a cell in a colony of size $N$ is given as:\n$R_N = R_0 \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$\n\nThe daily probability of a cell in the colony being eaten is $\\frac{\\delta}{N}$. Therefore, the daily survival probability for that cell is:\n$S_N = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}$\n\nThe fitness of a cell in the aggregate is the product of its reproductive rate and its survival probability:\n$W_a(N) = R_N \\times S_N = R_0 \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right)$\n\nTo find the optimal colony size $N_{opt}$, we need to find the value of $N$ that maximizes $W_a(N)$. We can do this by taking the derivative of $W_a(N)$ with respect to $N$ and setting it to zero. Since $R_0$ is a positive constant, we can maximize the function $f(N) = \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right)$ instead, which simplifies the calculation.\n\nWe use the product rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dN}(uv) = u\\frac{dv}{dN} + v\\frac{du}{dN}$, where $u(N) = \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$ and $v(N) = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of $u(N)$ and $v(N)$:\n$\\frac{du}{dN} = \\frac{d}{dN} \\exp(-\\alpha N + \\alpha) = -\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha N + \\alpha) = -\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$\n$\\frac{dv}{dN} = \\frac{d}{dN} \\left(1 - \\delta N^{-1}\\right) = - \\delta (-1) N^{-2} = \\frac{\\delta}{N^2}$\n\nNow, we apply the product rule to find $\\frac{df}{dN}$:\n$\\frac{df}{dN} = u\\frac{dv}{dN} + v\\frac{du}{dN}$\n$\\frac{df}{dN} = \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{N^2}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right) \\left(-\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))\\right)$\n\nTo find the maximum, we set the derivative to zero:\n$\\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{N^2}\\right) - \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{N}\\right) \\exp(-\\alpha(N-1)) = 0$\n\nWe can factor out the term $\\exp(-\\alpha(N-1))$, which is always positive for real $N$.

The parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ are also positive. The term under the square root, $\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta$, is strictly positive. Furthermore, $\\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta} > \\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2} = \\alpha\\delta$.\nThis means the solution with the minus sign, $\\alpha\\delta - \\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\delta^2 + 4\\alpha\\delta}$, will be negative.
