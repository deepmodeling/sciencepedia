{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in understanding the genetics of a population is to characterize its gene pool. This exercise provides practice in the most fundamental skill of population genetics: calculating allele frequencies directly from observed genotype counts. By working through this problem, you will learn how to quantify the genetic variation present in a population, which is the raw material for evolution [@problem_id:1970519].", "problem": "A team of field biologists is studying the genetic makeup of a specific population of wildflowers. In this species, flower color is determined by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele, $P$, for purple flowers, and a recessive allele, $p$, for white flowers. The researchers collected a random sample of 250 plants from a large meadow. Genetic sequencing of this sample revealed the following genotype distribution: 90 plants were homozygous dominant ($PP$), 120 plants were heterozygous ($Pp$), and 40 plants were homozygous recessive ($pp$).\n\nBased on the data from this sample, calculate the frequency of the dominant allele, $P$, in the sampled gene pool. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let $n_{PP}=90$, $n_{Pp}=120$, $n_{pp}=40$, and $N=n_{PP}+n_{Pp}+n_{pp}=250$. Each individual carries two alleles, so the total number of alleles sampled is $2N$. The number of dominant alleles $P$ contributed by the sample is $2n_{PP}+n_{Pp}$ because each $PP$ contributes two $P$ alleles and each $Pp$ contributes one $P$ allele.\n\nThe frequency of the dominant allele $P$ in the sampled gene pool is therefore\n$$\nf_{P}=\\frac{2n_{PP}+n_{Pp}}{2N}.\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\nf_{P}=\\frac{2\\cdot 90+120}{2\\cdot 250}=\\frac{180+120}{500}=\\frac{300}{500}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6}$$", "id": "1970519"}, {"introduction": "While direct genotype counting is ideal, it's often more practical to survey observable traits, or phenotypes. This problem introduces the Hardy-Weinberg principle, a foundational model in population genetics that connects allele frequencies to genotype and phenotype frequencies under specific conditions of equilibrium. You will practice using this principle to infer the frequency of alleles in a gene pool, even when some genetic information (like the number of heterozygotes) is not directly visible [@problem_id:1970518].", "problem": "In a large, isolated population of a recently discovered species of deep-sea crustacean, *Cryocaris gelidus*, a specific gene controls the color of the creature's bioluminescence. The allele for blue light, denoted by $B$, is dominant over the allele for green light, denoted by $b$. Individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype ($bb$) are the only ones that emit green light.\n\nAfter an extensive survey of this population, biologists determined that 16% of the individuals exhibit the green light phenotype. Assuming that this population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for this particular gene, calculate the frequency of the dominant allele ($B$) within the gene pool. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let $p$ denote the frequency of the dominant allele $B$, and $q$ denote the frequency of the recessive allele $b$. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the allele frequencies satisfy\n$$\np+q=1\n$$\nand the genotype frequencies are\n$$\np^{2} \\text{ ($BB$)}, \\quad 2pq \\text{ ($Bb$)}, \\quad q^{2} \\text{ ($bb$)}.\n$$\nOnly $bb$ individuals show the recessive (green) phenotype, so the observed green phenotype frequency equals $q^{2}$. Given the observed value $q^{2}=0.16$, solve for $q$:\n$$\nq=\\sqrt{0.16}=0.4,\n$$\nwhere the positive root is taken because allele frequencies are nonnegative. Then\n$$\np=1-q=1-0.4=0.6.\n$$\nThus, the frequency of the dominant allele $B$ is $0.6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6}$$", "id": "1970518"}, {"introduction": "Gene pools are not static; they are dynamic entities shaped by evolutionary forces. This practice problem moves beyond static description to model one of these key forces: migration, also known as gene flow. By calculating the impact of individuals moving between populations, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how migration can alter allele frequencies and homogenize gene pools over time [@problem_id:1970473].", "problem": "Two populations of Eastern gray squirrels (*Sciurus carolinensis*) inhabit the opposite banks of a large, fast-flowing river, which has historically prevented any interbreeding. The population on the West Bank has 800 individuals, while the population on the East Bank is larger, with 1200 individuals. Ecologists have been studying a single gene responsible for coat color. This gene has two alleles: a dominant allele for the common gray coat and a recessive allele, $m$, which results in a melanistic (black) coat phenotype when homozygous. In the West Bank population, the initial frequency of the recessive allele $m$ is 0.60. In the East Bank population, the initial frequency of the same allele is 0.20.\n\nRecently, a new bridge was constructed across the river. In the first season after the bridge's completion, a single, discrete migration event occurs before the annual breeding season. Observers documented that a group of 50 squirrels from the West Bank population migrated across the bridge and integrated into the East Bank population. Simultaneously, a group of 30 squirrels from the East Bank population migrated and joined the West Bank population. Assume the migrating squirrels are a random sample of their source population with respect to this gene.\n\nCalculate the new frequency of the recessive allele $m$ in the West Bank population immediately following this migration event. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let $N_{W}=800$ and $N_{E}=1200$ be the initial population sizes of West and East, and let the initial recessive-allele frequencies be $q_{W}=0.60$ (West) and $q_{E}=0.20$ (East). Let $M_{W\\to E}=50$ be the number migrating from West to East, and $M_{E\\to W}=30$ from East to West. Because migrants are a random sample with respect to the gene, the allele frequency among migrants from a source population equals that source population’s allele frequency. Each diploid individual contributes $2$ alleles to the gene pool.\n\nThe initial number of $m$ alleles in the West population is\n$$\nA_{W}^{\\text{init}}=2N_{W}q_{W}.\n$$\nThe number of $m$ alleles removed from West by emigration is\n$$\nA_{\\text{out}}=2M_{W\\to E}q_{W},\n$$\nand the number of $m$ alleles added to West by immigration is\n$$\nA_{\\text{in}}=2M_{E\\to W}q_{E}.\n$$\nTherefore, the post-migration number of $m$ alleles in West is\n$$\nA_{W}^{\\prime}=A_{W}^{\\text{init}}-A_{\\text{out}}+A_{\\text{in}}\n=2N_{W}q_{W}-2M_{W\\to E}q_{W}+2M_{E\\to W}q_{E}.\n$$\nThe new West population size is $N_{W}^{\\prime}=N_{W}-M_{W\\to E}+M_{E\\to W}$, so the total number of alleles is $2N_{W}^{\\prime}$.
