All moths in this population are homozygous for a wild-type allele, $W$, which results in brown-colored wings. One day, a single moth from a different population is blown to the island by a storm and successfully integrates into the breeding population. This new moth is heterozygous, carrying the wild-type allele $W$ and a novel recessive allele $w$ that causes gray-colored wings. The $w$ allele is selectively neutral, meaning it provides no survival or reproductive advantage or disadvantage relative to the $W$ allele. Assuming the total population size remains constant and that genetic drift is the sole evolutionary force acting on this allele's frequency, what is the probability that the gray-wing allele $w$ will eventually become fixed in the island population?\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We identify the total number of diploid individuals after the immigrant integrates as $N=400$ (the original 399 plus the single newcomer). At a single biallelic locus in a diploid population, there are $2N$ gene copies. The immigrant is heterozygous $Ww$, so there is exactly one copy of the novel allele $w$ in the population initially.

This problem moves beyond neutral alleles to explore the critical relationship between population size and the efficacy of natural selection. By calculating the effective population size ($N_e$) at which selection on a slightly advantageous allele overcomes the stochastic effects of drift, you will gain a quantitative understanding of when and where selection can act as the dominant driver of evolution.

They identify a novel mutation in a gene related to immune response. Through controlled experiments and sequence analysis, they determine that this new allele confers a small but consistent survival advantage, corresponding to a selection coefficient, $s$, of $0.0002$. The fate of this new advantageous mutation—whether it becomes fixed or is lost—is determined by the interplay between positive selection and random genetic drift. When the population size is small, the stochastic effects of genetic drift can be strong enough to overwhelm the directional effect of selection, causing the allele to behave as if it were neutral. Conversely, in a large population, selection is more effective and becomes the dominant force. The transition between these two evolutionary regimes occurs at a critical threshold for the effective population size ($N_e$).\n\nDetermine the threshold effective population size ($N_e$) at which this mutation transitions from being effectively neutral (drift-dominated) to being governed primarily by positive selection.
