Because the founders represent only a small sample of the source population, they may not carry all the alleles originally present, especially rare ones. This exercise demonstrates how to use probability to quantify the risk of losing an allele during a colonization event, a concept essential for conservation biology and for explaining the reduced genetic diversity often seen in isolated populations. [@problem_id:1970293]", "problem": "In a conservation effort, biologists plan to establish a new colony of the rare Golden-Winged Finch on a remote, protected island. The source population is a large, captive-bred flock that is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a specific genetic locus.

Because the 14 founders are mutually unrelated, each male founder represents a unique Y lineage and each female founder represents a unique mtDNA lineage at the start. The constraints “no new individuals,” “ignoring mutation,” and “ignoring genetic drift on lineage loss” together imply that no new lineages are added and none of the founding lineages are lost; hence the maximal possible numbers in the descendant population equal the number of corresponding-sex founders.\n\nTherefore,\n$$n_{Y}^{\\max} = 10,$$\n$$n_{mt}^{\\max} = 4.$$\n\nThe requested two-element row matrix is thus\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}10 & 4\\end{pmatrix}.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}10 & 4\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1970299"}]}
