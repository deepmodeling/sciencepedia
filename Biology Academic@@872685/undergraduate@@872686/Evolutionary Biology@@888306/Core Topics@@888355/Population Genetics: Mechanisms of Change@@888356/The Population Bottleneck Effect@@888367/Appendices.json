This exercise provides a quantitative framework for understanding this process by focusing on heterozygosity, a key measure of genetic variation. By applying the standard model of genetic drift, you will directly compare how the severity (a small population size) versus the duration of a bottleneck impacts the loss of genetic diversity, a critical trade-off in real-world conservation scenarios [@problem_id:1973365].", "problem": "A conservation biologist is studying the impact of population bottlenecks on the genetic diversity of a rare species of marsupial. Two isolated populations, Population A and Population B, are monitored. Initially, both populations are large and exhibit the same level of genetic diversity, characterized by an average heterozygosity of $H_0$.\n\nPopulation A experiences a sudden and severe environmental collapse. Its effective population size plummets to $N_A = 20$ individuals for a single generation ($t_A = 1$). After this single generation, conservation efforts are successful, and the population recovers to its original large size.\n\nPopulation B, located in a different region, suffers from prolonged habitat fragmentation. Its effective population size is reduced to $N_B = 40$ individuals, and it remains at this diminished size for five consecutive generations ($t_B = 5$) before conditions improve and the population recovers.\n\nFor the purposes of this model, assume that for an ideal population, the decrease in heterozygosity ($H$) from one generation to the next is governed by genetic drift, and that the population sizes before and after the bottleneck events are sufficiently large that their contribution to the loss of heterozygosity can be neglected. The effective population size is equal to the census size during the bottleneck.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the heterozygosity remaining in Population A ($H_A'$) to the heterozygosity remaining in Population B ($H_B'$) immediately after their respective bottleneck periods have concluded.

There are no homozygous resistant $\\text{RR}$ individuals.\n\nThe pesticide is then applied once across the entire region. The probability of any individual insect surviving the application is dependent on its genotype. For a susceptible $\\text{rr}$ insect, the survival probability is effectively zero. For any insect carrying the resistance allele $\\text{R}$ (in this case, the $\\text{Rr}$ individuals), the probability of survival is $c_R = 0.050$.
