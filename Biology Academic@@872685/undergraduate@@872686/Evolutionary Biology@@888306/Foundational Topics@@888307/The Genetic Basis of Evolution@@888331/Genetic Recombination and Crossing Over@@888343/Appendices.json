The allele for wild-type red eyes (`pr+`) is dominant over the allele for purple eyes (`pr`), and the allele for wild-type normal wings (`vg+`) is dominant over the allele for vestigial wings (`vg`).\n\nThe biologist performs a standard genetic cross. First, a pure-breeding fly with red eyes and normal wings is crossed with a pure-breeding fly with purple eyes and vestigial wings. This produces an F1 generation where all individuals have red eyes and normal wings.\n\nNext, a female from this F1 generation is selected and crossed with a male fly that has purple eyes and vestigial wings. This is a \"test cross\". The offspring from this test cross (the F2 generation) are collected and categorized, yielding the following counts:\n\n- Red eyes, normal wings: 882\n- Purple eyes, vestigial wings: 891\n- Red eyes, vestigial wings: 161\n- Purple eyes, normal wings: 166\n\nBased on these results, calculate the recombination frequency between the genes for eye color and wing shape. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to calculate the recombination frequency between the genes for eye color (`pr`) and wing shape (`vg`). This frequency is calculated as the proportion of recombinant offspring out of the total number of offspring.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the genotypes of the flies involved in the crosses.\nThe parental (P) generation cross is between a pure-breeding fly with red eyes and normal wings and a pure-breeding fly with purple eyes and vestigial wings.\nThe genotype of the red-eyed, normal-winged parent is `pr+/pr+ vg+/vg+`.\nThe genotype of the purple-eyed, vestigial-winged parent is `pr/pr vg/vg`.\n\nCrossing these two parents produces the F1 generation. All F1 offspring will be heterozygous for both genes, with the genotype `pr+/pr vg+/vg`. Since `pr+` and `vg+` are dominant, all F1 flies exhibit the wild-type phenotype of red eyes and normal wings, as stated in the problem. The arrangement of alleles on the chromosomes of the F1 female is such that one chromosome carries `pr+` and `vg+`, and the homologous chromosome carries `pr` and `vg`.\n\nNext, a test cross is performed by crossing an F1 female (`pr+/pr vg+/vg`) with a male that has purple eyes and vestigial wings. This male is homozygous recessive for both traits, with a genotype of `pr/pr vg/vg`.\n\nThe purpose of the test cross is that the phenotype of the offspring directly reveals the genetic makeup of the gametes produced by the heterozygous F1 parent. The homozygous recessive male only produces one type of gamete: `pr vg`.\n\nThe gametes produced by the F1 female can be either parental (non-recombinant) or recombinant.\nParental gametes have the same combination of alleles as the chromosomes the F1 female inherited from the P generation: `pr+ vg+` and `pr vg`.\nRecombinant gametes are produced when crossing over occurs between the two genes, resulting in new combinations of alleles: `pr+ vg` and `pr vg+`.\n\nNow, we can classify the F2 offspring from the test cross based on their phenotypes to determine whether they arose from parental or recombinant gametes from the F1 mother.\n\n- **Parental Phenotypes**: These result from the fertilization of an egg containing a parental gamete by the `pr vg` sperm.\n  - Offspring with red eyes and normal wings (`pr+/pr vg+/vg`) came from a `pr+ vg+` gamete. Count = 882.\n  - Offspring with purple eyes and vestigial wings (`pr/pr vg/vg`) came from a `pr vg` gamete. Count = 891.\n  - Total number of parental offspring = $882 + 891 = 1773$.\n\n- **Recombinant Phenotypes**: These result from the fertilization of an egg containing a recombinant gamete by the `pr vg` sperm.\n  - Offspring with red eyes and vestigial wings (`pr+/pr vg/vg`) came from a `pr+ vg` gamete. Count = 161.\n  - Offspring with purple eyes and normal wings (`pr/pr vg+/vg`) came from a `pr vg+` gamete. Count = 166.\n  - Total number of recombinant offspring = $161 + 166 = 327$.\n\nThe recombination frequency (RF) is defined as the number of recombinant offspring divided by the total number of offspring, expressed as a decimal or percentage.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of offspring:\nTotal offspring = (Parental offspring) + (Recombinant offspring)\nTotal offspring = $1773 + 327 = 2100$.\nAlternatively, Total offspring = $882 + 891 + 161 + 166 = 2100$.\n\nNow, calculate the recombination frequency:\n$$\n\\text{RF} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of recombinant offspring}}{\\text{Total number of offspring}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RF} = \\frac{327}{2100}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RF} = 0.15571428...\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\nThe first three significant figures are 1, 5, and 5. The fourth digit is 7, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the third significant figure.\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is $0.156$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.156}$$", "id": "1933971"}, {"introduction": "Once individual map distances are known, they can be used to predict the frequencies of more complex genetic events.

This exercise reinforces the concept of a genetic map as a predictive model of chromosomal behavior.", "problem": "In studying the genetics of a newly discovered species of fruit fly, *Drosophila ananassae*, researchers have identified three linked genes on a single autosome.

The genetic map distance between the `ey` and `wg` loci is found to be 18.0 centiMorgans (cM). The distance between the `wg` and `bd` loci is 12.5 cM.\n\nAssuming that crossover events in the two adjacent chromosomal regions occur independently of each other (i.e., there is no chromosomal interference), calculate the expected frequency of gametes that are the product of a double crossover event.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We are given adjacent map distances between genes in a three-point cross: $d_{ey,wg} = 18.0$ cM and $d_{wg,bd} = 12.5$ cM, with the order $ey$ - $wg$ - $bd$. Under the assumption of no interference (independent crossovers in adjacent intervals), the expected frequency of double crossover gametes equals the product of the recombination fractions in the two intervals.\n\nBy definition, a map distance of $1$ cM corresponds to a recombination fraction of $0.01$. Thus, the recombination fractions for the two intervals are\n$$\nr_{ey,wg} = 18.0 \\times 0.01 = 0.180, \\qquad r_{wg,bd} = 12.5 \\times 0.01 = 0.125.\n$$\nWith no interference, the expected double crossover frequency is\n$$\nf_{\\text{DCO}} = r_{ey,wg} \\times r_{wg,bd} = 0.180 \\times 0.125 = 0.0225.\n$$\nExpressed as a decimal and rounded to three significant figures, this is $0.0225$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0225}$$", "id": "1933954"}, {"introduction": "The relationship between map distance, measured in centiMorgans, and the observed recombination frequency is not a simple one-to-one correspondence, especially for distant genes.

Working through this scenario clarifies why linked genes that are very far apart can assort independently, with a recombination frequency approaching a maximum of $0.5$.", "problem": "In a particular species of insect, wing pigmentation is controlled by gene `A` (dominant allele `A` for dark wings, recessive allele `a` for light wings), and antenna shape is controlled by gene `B` (dominant allele `B` for straight antennae, recessive allele `b` for curved antennae). These two genes are known to be located on the same autosome. A geneticist establishes a true-breeding line of insects with dark wings and curved antennae and another true-breeding line with light wings and straight antennae.\n\nAn individual from the dark-winged, curved-antenna line is crossed with an individual from the light-winged, straight-antenna line to produce an F1 generation. An F1 female is then selected and test-crossed with a male that has light wings and curved antennae.\n\nGenetic mapping data from other extensive experiments have precisely located the distance between gene `A` and gene `B` to be 85 centiMorgans (cM).

Hence the expected fraction of dark, straight progeny is $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n\nThe given map distance is $85$ cM. Recombination fraction cannot exceed $0.5$, and for large map distances (substantially greater than $50$ cM), the expected recombination fraction approaches $0.5$ due to multiple crossovers randomizing associations.
