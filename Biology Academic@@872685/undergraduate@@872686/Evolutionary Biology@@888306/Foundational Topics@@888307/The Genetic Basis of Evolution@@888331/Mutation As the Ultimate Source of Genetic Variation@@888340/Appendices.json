This exercise demonstrates a fundamental principle: the immense size of many populations ensures a constant and substantial supply of new mutations, which serve as the raw material for natural selection. By calculating the total number of new mutations appearing in a single gene across a large population in one generation, you can gain a quantitative appreciation for mutation as the engine of genetic diversity [@problem_id:1949414].", "problem": "A team of astrobiologists has discovered a species of single-celled, haploid archaea, which they have named *Thermofilum rapidus*, thriving near a hydrothermal vent on a distant moon.

At Locus 1, alleles $a$ and $A$ are possible. At Locus 2, alleles $b$ and $B$ are possible. The population is initially composed entirely of individuals with the $aB$ genotype, which is considered the wild-type. The fitness of this wild-type genotype is defined as $W_{aB} = 1.0$.\n\nThe fitness of any other genotype is determined by a simple additive model with an interaction term.
