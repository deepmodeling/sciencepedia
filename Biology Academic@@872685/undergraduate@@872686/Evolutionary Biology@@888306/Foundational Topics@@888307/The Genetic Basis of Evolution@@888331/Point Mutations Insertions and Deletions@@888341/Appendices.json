We are given the necessary parameters: the population size ($N$), the genome size ($L$), and the per-base-pair mutation rate per generation ($\\mu$).\n\nFirst, let's identify the given values:\n- Population size, $N = 5.00 \\times 10^{9}$ cells.\n- Genome size, $L = 4.64 \\times 10^{6}$ base pairs (bp) per cell.\n- Mutation rate, $\\mu = 1.00 \\times 10^{-9}$ mutations per base pair per generation.\n\nThe strategy is to first determine the total number of base pairs present in the entire population.

This translation is performed by reading the sequence of nucleotide bases in groups of three, called codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid or a stop signal. A single-nucleotide point mutation is a change in one of these bases.\n\nWe want to quantitatively analyze how the position of a point mutation within a codon affects its likelihood of altering the resulting amino acid. For this analysis, you are provided with the standard mRNA codon table below, which maps all 64 possible codons to their corresponding amino acids or a stop signal.\n\n**Standard mRNA Codon Table:**\n- **Alanine (Ala):** GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG\n- **Arginine (Arg):** CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG\n- **Asparagine (Asn):** AAU, AAC\n- **Aspartic acid (Asp):** GAU, GAC\n- **Cysteine (Cys):** UGU, UGC\n- **Glutamic acid (Glu):** GAA, GAG\n- **Glutamine (Gln):** CAA, CAG\n- **Glycine (Gly):** GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG\n- **Histidine (His):** CAU, CAC\n- **Isoleucine (Ile):** AUU, AUC, AUA\n- **Leucine (Leu):** UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG\n- **Lysine (Lys):** AAA, AAG\n- **Methionine (Met):** AUG\n- **Phenylalanine (Phe):** UUU, UUC\n- **Proline (Pro):** CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG\n- **Serine (Ser):** UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC\n- **Threonine (Thr):** ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG\n- **Tryptophan (Trp):** UGG\n- **Tyrosine (Tyr):** UAU, UAC\n- **Valine (Val):** GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG\n- **STOP:** UAA, UAG, UGA\n\nTo perform the analysis, we make the following simplifying assumptions:\n1. Any of the 64 codons in a coding sequence is equally likely to be the site of a mutation.\n2. The mutation is equally likely to occur at the first, second, or third position of the codon.\n3.
