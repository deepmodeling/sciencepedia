Two distinct, genetically determined phenotypes exist among the males: those with \"Vibrant\" blue crests and those with \"Subdued\" grey crests. The study meticulously tracked the lifetime reproductive output of numerous males from both groups. The primary metric for success was defined as the number of offspring surviving to their own reproductive maturity.\n\nThe data, averaged over the entire study period, revealed the following:\n- A male with the \"Vibrant\" phenotype, on average, produces 19 offspring that survive to maturity.\n- A male with the \"Subdued\" phenotype, on average, produces 13 offspring that survive to maturity.\n\nAssuming these values represent the absolute fitness for each phenotype, calculate the relative fitness of a male with the \"Subdued\" phenotype.
